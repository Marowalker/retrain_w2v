The insulin-regulated
aminopeptidase (IRAP) is a membrane-bound
zinc metallopeptidase with many important regulatory functions. It
has been demonstrated that inhibition of IRAP by angiotensin IV (Ang
IV) and other peptides, as well as more druglike inhibitors, improves
cognition in several rodent models. We recently reported a series
of aryl sulfonamides as small-molecule IRAP inhibitors and a promising
scaffold for pharmacological intervention. We have now expanded with
a number of derivatives, report their stability in liver microsomes,
and characterize the activity of the whole series in a new assay performed
on recombinant human IRAP. Several compounds, such as the new fluorinated
derivative 29, present submicromolar affinity and high
metabolic stability. Starting from the two binding modes previously
proposed for the sulfonamide scaffold, we systematically performed
molecular dynamics simulations and binding affinity estimation with
the linear interaction energy method for the full compound series.
The significant agreement with experimental affinities suggests one
of the binding modes, which was further confirmed by the excellent
correlation for binding affinity differences between the selected
pair of compounds obtained by rigorous free energy perturbation calculations.
The new experimental data and the computationally derived structure–activity
relationship of the sulfonamide series provide valuable information
for further lead optimization of novel IRAP inhibitors.

Introduction
It has been known for
more than 25 years that angiotensin IV (Ang
IV, 1; Figure 1), a degradation product of the vasoactive peptide angiotensin
II, enhances memory and learning in rodents after intracerebroventricular
administration.1−8 Thus, the degradation leads to a bioactive hexapeptide with very
different biological activity from that of the parent octapeptide.9,10 In 2001, the membrane-bound insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP,
oxytocinase, EC 3.4.11.3) was identified as a binding site for Ang
IV,11 a potent inhibitor of IRAP, as is
LVV-hemorphin-7, which is formed by degradation of β-globin.12,13 The M1 aminopeptidase, IRAP, is found in brain structures associated
with cognitive, sensory, and motor functions along with other biological
functions such as antigenic peptide generation for MHC Class I for
cross-presentation,14,15 translocation of GLUT4,16 and oxytocin and vasopressin levels in the brain.
The extracellular region of IRAP contains the catalytic site and is
highly homologous to two other M1 aminopeptidase family members, endoplasmic
reticulum aminopeptidase 1(ERAP1) and 2(ERAP2).17 These three enzymes constitute the so-called antigen processing
aminopeptidases anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), in charge
of trim antigenic peptides that will ultimately be used to modulate
adaptative response, therefore being potential drug targets for the
regulation of immune responses.18 Although
the poli-inhibition of several APAs is a good starting point in pharmaceutical
development in this respect, low selectivity between the three APAs
limits the clinical development. From the existing hypotheses to explain
the effects of Ang IV in vivo,19−21 the one that attracted the most
attention is that Ang IV and its analogues enhance cognitive functions
through IRAP inhibition, resulting in altered levels of neuropeptides
in the brain and/or facilitating glucose uptake in neurons by regulating
GLUT4 translocation.21−23 The last factor is in line with the well-known enhancement
of cognitive performance by glucose24 and
is reinforced by the fact that IRAP inhibitors do not alter glucose
handling in normal and diabetic rats.25 Endogenous substrates of IRAP, such as macrocyclic peptides oxytocin
(2) and vasopressin (3), which encompass
a disulfide element adjacent to the cleavage site of the ring system
(Figure 1), are known
to exert favorable influences on cognitive parameters in the brain.23,26

Figure 1 IRAP
inhibitors and substrates: hexapeptide IRAP inhibitor Ang
IV (1), macrocyclic IRAP substrates oxytocin (2) and vasopressin (3), macrocyclic IRAP inhibitor HA-08
(4), and cognitive enhancer dihexa (5) that
binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Compounds 6–8 are low-molecular-weight IRAP inhibitors, not derived from
the structure of Ang IV.

Our labs are engaged in a collaborative program aimed at
identifying
inhibitors of IRAP as a possible new class of cognitive enhancers.27−31 Although several potent linear Ang IV analogues have previously
been reported,32−35 we have previously reported a large series of cyclic peptides and
pseudopeptides;36−41 particularly interesting among these were the macrocyclic analogs,
mimicking the N-terminal fragment of Ang IV, and the IRAP-specific
substrates oxytocin and vasopressin, from which compound HA-08 (compound 4, Figure 1) emerges as a very potent inhibitor of the enzyme (IC50 = 8.6 nM; Ki = 3 nM).38 The biological characterization of this compound demonstrates
that it affects the morphology of dendritic spines from rat hippocampal
primary cultures and increases the number of stubby/mushroomlike spines,
a property associated with improvement of memory and cognitive functions.30 However, this and related macrocyclic inhibitors
are still peptidic molecules, likely to be associated with pharmacokinetic
problems such as limited blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeation.
Notably, a dipeptide derivative from Ang IV, known as Dihexa (compound 5, Figure 1), which increases dendritic spine density and serves as a powerful
cognitive enhancer in animal models, is able to cross the BBB. However,
it remains unclear whether this molecule is an IRAP inhibitor, and
to date, there is only evidence that this peptide binds to the hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF).42,43

The first series of druglike
IRAP inhibitors reported comprises
a benzopyran scaffold. The benzopyran, HFI-419 (Compound 6, Figure 1), represents
one example of the promising compounds from this class.27,44 The inhibitors from the HFI series were identified through in silico
screening and are proven to be effective as cognitive enhancers in
both normal and memory-deficit rat models.44−46 The 3,4-diaminobenzoic
acid derivative 7 is an example of another class of compounds
able to efficiently inhibit IRAP, showing in this case moderate selectivity
versus ERAP1 and ERAP2.47 More recently,
very potent IRAP inhibitors relying on efficient zinc coordination
through a phosphinic group were disclosed.48,49

We previously screened 10 500 low-molecular-weight
druglike
compounds in an enzyme inhibition assay with IRAP from Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells,50 from which compound 8 and related sulfonamides (Figure 1) were identified as a novel class of druglike
IRAP inhibitors.51 Two analogs from this
series were further evaluated and found to alter the morphology and
increase the density of dendritic spines of hippocampal cells from
mice.31 By means of exhaustive docking
and free energy calculations, we identified two binding orientations
compatible with the experimental data there reported.31 Encouraged by these results, we herein expanded the sulfonamide
collection with a series of fluoro atom substituted derivatives and
report the capacity of the resulting expanded series (8–34, Table 1) to inhibit recombinant human IRAP expressed in membranes
of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). The fluorinated series exhibits
high metabolic stability in microsomes and encompasses compounds with
submicromolar affinity. The binding modes previously identified were
thoroughly examined here with molecular dynamics (MD)-related methods
for binding affinity estimation for the whole series of aryl sulfonamides.
Thus, absolute binding free energies were obtained for each binding
mode with the linear interaction energy (LIE) method, followed by
calculations of relative binding free energies between six pairs of
compounds using free energy perturbation (FEP) protocols. The results
of this computational analysis clearly identify one binding mode,
which specifically explains the structure–activity relationship
(SAR) data and allows for elucidation of the molecular details involved
in ligand binding to the protease.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Compounds 8–26 were prepared according to methods
previously described.51,52 Trichloro compound 27 and fluoro compounds 28–34 were
prepared from 3-amino phenyltetrazole
and the corresponding arylsulfonyl chloride to deliver the aryl sulfonamides,
as shown in Scheme 1.

IRAP Inhibition and SAR
The ability
of compounds 8–34 of inhibiting the
catalytic activity
of recombinant human IRAP was examined in transiently transfected
HEK293 cells; the results are summarized in Table 1. The data confirms the same SAR trend as
previously observed from a smaller series of sulfonamides tested in
CHO cells, that is, containing the hamster enzyme,51 although somewhat lower IC50 values were encountered
with the human IRAP assay (Figure S1, Supporting
Information). Sulfonamides 25 and 26, which
were previously shown to enhance the density of dendritic spines in
primary hippocampal neuron cultures from mice,31 show IC50 values of 0.74 μM (vs 3.1 μM
in CHO cells) and 0.54 μM (vs 2.9 μM), respectively. Among
the general SAR observations, the negative charge of the tetrazole
ring seems essential for IRAP inhibition because methylation of the
acidic NH position was deleterious for activity (cf. 8 and 9). A similar negative effect was observed by replacement
of the tetrazole by a methylamide group (cf. 10 and 9). The integrity of the sulfonamide linker seems essential
for IRAP affinity, as suggested by the 10-fold drop in binding affinity
after methylation of the acidic NH group (cf. 8 and 11) or the complete lack of inhibitory activity of the corresponding
amide-derivative 12. A thiophene ring is admitted only
if it is halogenated, as is the case of dichloro substituted inhibitor 13, showing submicromolar activity, as opposed to inactive,
unsubstituted derivative 14. Pyridine derivative 15 is also devoid of IRAP activity, whereas the benzene derivative,
which also displayed no inhibitory activity applying the previous
assay, is here shown to moderately inhibit the human IRAP (IC50 = 14.5 μM). Bicyclic derivatives are well tolerated;
see compounds 17, 18, 19, and
particularly submicromolar benzoxadiazole 21. However,
biphenyl derivative 20 is totally inactive, indicating
some restriction in the binding cavity accommodating this substitution.
To assess the halogenation on the phenyl ring, the previous set of
derivatives of compound 16 (containing 22–26, all of which show promising IC50 values below 10 μM) was here expanded with compounds 27–34. As expected, most compounds show
an important improvement compared to that of the reference unsubstituted 16, with compounds 25, 26, and 29 showing the same submicromolar potency as that of benzoxadiazole 21.

Stability in Liver Microsomes
The
most potent sulfonamides,
together with the new series of derivatives (21, 25–34), were selected for characterization
of their stability against oxidative metabolism. Stability was assessed
using liver microsomes from human liver (HLM) and from mouse (MLM)
applying a protocol previously reported.53 All compounds evaluated exhibited a high stability in the microsome
assays with the exception of 25 and 30,
which were degraded fast in HLM (t1/2 of
2 and 4 min, respectively), as shown in Table 1. This observation can be most likely attributed
to a human enzyme-specific benzylic oxidation of the para methyl groups
of 25 and 30, and the meta methyl derivative 31 was significantly less prone to decomposition (t1/2 = 600 min).

MD and LIE Calculations
In a previous attempt to understand
the binding mode of inhibitors 21, 25, and 26, a pool of possible binding orientations was initially
generated by exhaustive docking of compound 26. Each
pose was subject to MD simulations, coupled to binding affinity estimation
with the LIE method54,55 for the three compounds in the
series. Two alternative binding modes, pose A and pose B, were compatible
with the experimental ranking in affinities within this limited subset.31 One of the sulfone oxygens coordinates the Zn2+ ion in both binding modes, which otherwise are flipped with
respect to each other in a way that the position of the aryl (or heteroaryl)
and phenyltetrazole moieties are switched between them (Figure 2). We herein built every complex
consisting of the 27 sulfonamides (compounds 8–34 in Table 1) in each of the two binding poses (A and B; see Figure 2) and performed a similar exploration
with MD sampling coupled to the LIE estimation of binding affinities.
Inactive compounds 9 and 10 were not considered
because they are the only neural ones in the otherwise charged series
of compounds (see below). All simulated compounds were stable in each
of the two poses, where the key interactions of the sulfone oxygen,
−NH, and tetrazole groups described below were maintained for
the whole series in different independent replicate MD simulations.
In pose A (Figure 2A), the ligand is further stabilized by interactions between its
−NH group and Glu465. The tetrazole ring is accommodated in
the cavity defined by the hinge loop between residues 438 and 443,
dominated by polar interaction with the backbone of Arg439 and the
side chain of Thr442. The heteroaryl substituent is facing the GAMEN
loop (428Gly–Ala–Met–Glu–Asn432), a key structural motif that remains open during the MD
simulations of the crystal structure considered,30,56 allowing accommodation of most substitutions explored in the series.
The alternate pose B (Figure 2B) places the heteroaryl group close to the 438–443
loop, and the tetrazole is coordinated to Arg439. This area is relatively
solvent exposed, and the aforementioned interaction is sometimes bridged
via a water molecule in the MD simulations. Additionally, the −NH
group of the sulfonamide in this binding mode interacts with the carboxylate
groups of Glu295 and Glu431 via a water molecule.

cleft of human IRAP. (A) pose A; (B) pose B. Zn2+ and water
molecules are shown as gray and red spheres, respectively, and chlorine
atoms are represented in green. All of the figures shown are from
2 ns MD average structures.

Binding free energies estimated with the LIE methodology
are reported
in Table 2, and the
values obtained in each pose are compared to the experimental values
from HEK293 cells, as extracted from Table 1. Owing to the strong electrostatic ligand
interactions with the Zn2+ ion, which is very sensitive
to given force field parameters, it was found necessary in previous
LIE calculations to empirically determine the electrostatic scaling
factor β.30,31,57 The same situation was, for example, encountered with saccharide
binding to lectins in which the ligand interactions were dominated
by coordination to calcium ions.57 The
earlier derived β-value of 0.19 for IRAP ligands30,31 was, however, based on MD simulations with only three peptidic inhibitors.
Still, it led to a good correlation between MD sampled energies—using
both poses A and B—and CHO experimental affinities for the
three sulfonamides recently characterized (21, 25, and 26). In the present series, 21 out of the 27 compounds have experimentally determined
IC50 values, whereas compounds 9, 10, 12, and 20 exhibit IC50 values
>1000 μM and compounds 14–15 have IC50 > 100 μM. Hence, we selected this
subset
of 21 compounds in each binding mode (A and B) to optimize
the LIE model by independent fitting of the β and γ parameters,
while using the standard value of α = 0.181 (free parameterization
of the last parameter did not improve the statistics). Figure 3 shows the correlation between
calculated and experimental affinities for the two binding modes,
together with the corresponding optimized parameters and the calculated
mean unassigned error (MUE). A similarly low value of β ≈
0.1 is obtained in the two binding modes, which is likely due to the
strong Zn2+ interactions as outlined above. Notably, the
offset parameter, γ, which is only a constant (in kcal/mol)
that does not affect relative binding free energies, is more negative
for pose A than pose B. This indeed reflects overall more favorable
interaction energies in the latter pose, which is particularly due
to the electrostatic component of the binding free energy (ΔGel; see Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2). Further, a modest correlation between ΔGel,calc and ΔGobs is only observed for pose B, which is indicative of more specific
electrostatic interactions as compared to that for pose A (see Supporting Information Figure S2). The two models
show reasonably good statistical performance, with MUEs of 0.54 (A)
and 0.43 (B) kcal/mol. The slightly better performance for pose B
is, however, barely significant considering that the experimental
binding free energies only span 2.1 kcal/mol for the 21 compounds. The capacity of each model to reproduce the relative
ranking within the series was also assessed with Pearson correlation
coefficients, which again favor pose B (R = 0.64 compared to R = 0.36 for pose A). However, none of the models can completely capture the low affinity
of nonbinders 12, 14, 15, and 20, which are overestimated in the two models (Table 2).

(A, pose A; B,
pose B) and experimental binding free energies of
the sulfonamide series. The plots contain 21 data points, as the six
compounds without a measured IC50 value are excluded from
this quantitative evaluation.

Free Energy Perturbation
Calculations
To confirm the
indication of the LIE models that marginally favor pose B and further
investigate the reasons for the low affinity of nonbinders, we designed
a set of free energy perturbation (FEP) transformations for selected
pairs of ligands. With this approach, one can estimate the relative
binding free energies (ΔΔG) between pairs
of compounds and compare with the corresponding experimental shifts
in binding affinities. A total of 10 ligands were considered in six
pairs of FEP transformations, which were also carried out in parallel
in both binding modes. These include nonbinders 9, 12, 14, and 20, which were selected
to cover different structural changes affecting the affinity within
the series. The results of the FEP calculations are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 4. The drastic effect observed
by methylation of the tetrazole ring was examined by performing the
transformation 8 ↔ 9. In this case,
pose B reproduces the experimental effect very accurately,
which can be related to the loss of interactions with Arg439, leading
to major rearrangements of the ligand (Figure 5). In contrast, in pose A, the tetrazole ring is buried toward the 438–443 loop, and
the effect of methylation and the corresponding charge neutralization
is instead predicted to be favorable for the affinity (Supporting Information Figure S3). Two pairs
of perturbations were carried out to examine the drop of enzyme inhibition
observed by variations of the sulfonamide linker: replacement of sulfonamide
by an amide (8 ↔ 12) and methylation
of the −NH group (13 ↔ 11).
In the former case, the loss of binding affinity is due to the amide
adopting a more energetically favorable trans conformation, leading
to the loss of interactions in both poses A and B (Figure 5B). More subtle and specific is the effect of methylation in compound 11 compared to that in unmethylated derivative 13. The experimental 10-fold drop in affinity is only observed in the
simulations of pose B (Table 3 and Figure 4) and can be assigned to the loss of the interaction
between NH and Glu431 conserved in this pose (Figure 5C). Note that in this case, we also evaluated
the negligible effect on binding affinity of the Br/Cl transformation
between this pair, correctly reproduced in the model of pose B. The remaining three FEP transformations examined the
impact of modifications of the aryl moiety. The positive effect of
halogenation on the thiophene (transformation 14 ↔ 13) or the benzene rings (23 ↔ 22) was also exclusively reproduced in pose B (Table 3 and Figure 4). In the case of thiophene,
the unsubstituted compound (14) is a nonbinder, in contrast
to the sub-micrometer inhibitor bearing a 3,4-dichloro-2-thiophene
(13). Notably, this effect is specifically captured by
the FEP simulation in pose B, but was underpredicted
in the corresponding LIE model. The FEP calculations of pose B are sensitive enough to detect the milder effect of fluorination
in the orthoposition of the benzene ring (23 ↔ 22), which is explained by the optimized interactions of the
aryl group with residues in the 438–443 loop. Finally, an intriguing
transformation not captured in the LIE models referred to the introduction
of a biphenyl ring in compound 16 to yield compound 20, which led to an experimental loss of any inhibitory activity.
This effect is indeed reproduced in the corresponding FEP simulation
(16 ↔ 20) in pose B, where the substitution leads to a suboptimal fitting of the biphenyl
in the narrow cavity defined by the 438–443 loop (Figure 5F), which provides
further evidence of the specificity of this binding model in explaining
the SAR of the current series.

IRAP Selectivity of Sulfonamides
We have previously
reported that sulfonamides 21, 25, and 26 are specific IRAP inhibitors, with much lower efficacy
in inhibiting the activity of the homologous enzymes, aminopeptidase
N (APN) and leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H).31 Our extended binding mode analysis of the whole series of sulfonamides
on IRAP allows for interpretation of the selectivity. Figure 6 shows a superposition of the
two IRAP-26 complexes (pose A and pose B) with the crystal structures of APN (PDB code 4FYQ)58 and LTA4H (PDB code 2VJ8).59 The optimal
complementarity between inhibitor 26 and the GAMEN loop
of IRAP, which is maintained along the whole sulfonamide series, is
in stark contrast to the GAMEN loop conformation found in APN and
LTA4H. The conformation of the loop in the latter enzymes is clearly
incompatible with the binding modes discussed herein. However, a similar
conformation of the GAMEN loop was also observed in the latest crystal
structure of IRAP in complex with the phosphinic derivatives. Although
this may be a property of that particular inhibitor, one should not
rule out the possibility that all potent inhibitors promote the “closing”
of the active site, which should be acknowledged and discussed. We
thus attempted to dock the series in this “closed” IRAP
following our previous protocols with GLIDE.30,31 The initial results did not show any conserved pose, and no inhibitor
was able to make interactions with the Zn+2. This was still
the case in a second round of constrained docking imposing interaction
with the metal, a strategy that was useful with the “open”
IRAP structure.30,31 The current exploration reinforces
the idea that these series of sulfonamides cannot access the binding
site for competitive inhibition considering the closed conformation
of the GAMEN loop, which might be stabilized by the phosphinic derivatives
due to their increased conformational flexibility,60 compared to the relatively rigid aryl sulfonamides here
presented. Thus, the specificity of IRAP for the sulfonamides can,
at least in part, be related to the particular configuration of its
GAMEN loop typical for the open configuration of this enzyme.

Conclusions
We have extended our previously reported
series of sulfonamides
as inhibitors of human IRAP by synthesis of novel fluorinated analogs
and performed an enzymatic and computational structural analysis of
their inhibitory activity toward human IRAP. The biological data reveals
several inhibitors with activity in the sub-micrometer range. Earlier
computations on a limited set of sulfonamides (21, 25, and 26) predicted two possible binding modes.
Here, we examined the full series of 27 compounds by molecular dynamics
free energy calculations using both the linear interaction energy
method and free energy perturbation simulations. The calculations
on this larger set of compounds allow us to unambiguously identify
the most favorable pose of the two binding poses. We foresee that
this analysis will be helpful in our efforts to further improve the
inhibitory capacity of IRAP inhibitors.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich/Apollo scientific/Acros/Fluorochem and used as received
without further purification. Purification was performed on a semipreparative
Gilson GX-271 RP-HPLC system, equipped with a Macherey-Nagel Nucleodur
C18 column (21 × 125 mm, 5 μm particle size) and a H2O/CH3CN/0.05% HCOOH gradient over 15 min. Analytical
high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)
was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC-MS system with an ion
trap mass spectrometer and detection was performed by UV (DAD) and
MS (ESI– or ESI+) using a Phenomenex
Kinetex C18 column (50 × 3.0 mm, 2.6 μm particle size,
100 Å pore size) and a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. A gradient of
H2O/CH3CN/0.05% HCOOH was used.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Mercury
Plus spectrometer (1H: 400 MHz, 13C: 101 MHz)
using CDCl3, CD3OD, acetone-d6, or DMSO-d6 as solvent.
HRMS were recorded on a Micromass Q-Tof2 mass spectrometer equipped
with an electronspray ion source. Compounds 8–26 were prepared according to the methods previously described.51,52

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 27–34
To a solution of 3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)aniline
(36) (0.5 mmol) in anhydrous
CH2Cl2 (5 mL) under an atmosphere of nitrogen
was added appropriate sulfonyl chloride (35) (0.6 mmol)
and pyridine (1.5 mmol). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred
at room temperature overnight and then quenched with a saturated solution
of NH4Cl (20 mL); the pH was adjusted to around 4 by the
addition of 1 M aq HCl. The aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic phases
were dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated under
reduced pressure. The residue obtained was purified by preparative
HPLC running a gradient of H2O/CH3CN/0.05% HCOOH
to give the corresponding products.

Enzyme Assay
The efficacy of the candidate compounds
to inhibit IRAP enzymatic activity was analyzed using solubilized,
crude membranes isolated from HEK293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) transfected
with pCI-IRAP. Membranes from vector-only transfected cells were used
as a negative control. IRAP enzymatic activity was determined by the
hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate l-leucine-4-methyl-7-coumarinylamide
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and monitored by the release of a fluorogenic
product at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 430 nm,
respectively. Assays were performed in 96-well plates; each well contained
1 μg of solubilized membrane protein and 25 μM substrate
in a final volume of 100 μL in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 7.4). Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min using
a Wallac Victor3 V Multilabel counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).
IC50 values for each of the inhibitors were determined
over a range of concentrations (0.01–100 μM) and were
calculated from three independent experiments, reporting the mean
± SEM.

Preparation of the IRAP Structure and Ligand
Docking
The crystal structure of human IRAP was retrieved
from the protein
data bank (PDB code 4PJ6),56 and chain A of the crystal dimer
was retained and prepared for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
The preparation of the structure (i.e., addition of hydrogens, rotamer
assignment of Asn and His) was performed with Maestro version 9.2.
(Schrödinger, LLC; NY). The series of sulfonamides was built
in a reliable three-dimensional conformation with the same software,
and each compound was docked by structural alignment (“flexible
ligand superposition” protocol in Schrödinger) in each
of the two binding modes (pose A and pose B) previously determined for compound 26.30,31 The last complex was superimposed to the crystal structures of the
homologous enzymes APN and LTA4H (PDB codes 4FYQ(58) and 2VJ8,59 respectively) using the PyMol61 graphical interface, to analyze the structural
reasons for selectivity.

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
MD simulations
were performed under spherical boundary conditions using program Q,62 allowing an efficient sampling of the free energies
of many ligands at a low computational cost, while attaining reliable
statistics.63,64 The all-atom optimized potentials
for liquid simulations force field for proteins was used,65 in combination with compatible parameters for
Zn2+ ion and automatic parameterization of the ligands,
performed with Macromodel version 10.6 (Schrödinger LLC). A
simulation sphere of 25 Å radius centered on the equivalent position
of the Cα atom of His4 in Ang IV was built as previously described.30,31 The sphere was solvated with TIP3P water molecules66 and subjected to polarization and radial constraints according
to the surface-constrained all-atom solvent model62,67 to mimic the properties of bulk water at the sphere surface. Protein
atoms outside the simulation sphere were restrained to their initial
positions and only interacted with the system through bonds, angles,
and torsions. Excluding His, all other titratable residues within
20 Å of the Zn2+ ion were treated in their charged
form. In addition, the residues Lys520, Lys726, Glu767, Asp773, Arg817,
Glu818, Arg820, Glu825, Arg858, Glu887, Lys890, Lys892, Glu895, Arg933,
and Glu1002, in the 20–25 Å layer of the sphere, were
also treated as ionized because they were forming salt bridges. With
this setup, the simulation sphere was overall neutral, thus avoiding
the consideration of additional Born terms in the calculation of free
energies of charged ligands as compared to that of the bulk solvent.
Nonbonded interactions were calculated explicitly up to a 10 Å
cutoff, except for the ligand atoms for which no cutoff was used.
Beyond the direct cutoff, long-range electrostatics were treated with
the local reaction field multipole expansion method.68 During a 175 ps equilibration stage, the system was slowly
heated to the target temperature of 310 K while initial positional
restrains on all solute heavy atoms were gradually released. The subsequent
data collection phase consisted of 10 replica MD simulations of 2
ns each, with randomized initial velocities, accounting for a total
of 20 ns sampling trajectories where the ligand-surrounding energies
were collected for binding affinity calculations. A time step of 1
fs was used, and no positional restraints were applied. Solvent bonds
and angles were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm.69 Nonbonded pair lists were updated every 25 steps,
and the ligand-surrounding interaction energies were sampled every
50 steps. To estimate free energies of binding, ligand-surrounding
energies were also sampled in parallel MD simulations of the reference
state, that, solvated in water, using the same conditions as for the
bound state.

Linear Interaction Energy Binding Affinity
Calculations
Binding free energies of every compound were
calculated using the
linear interaction energy (LIE) method as54,55 1  where Δ⟨Ul-svdW⟩
and Δ⟨Ul-sel⟩ are, respectively, the differences
in the average nonpolar and polar ligand-surrounding interaction energies
in the two states, that is, free and bound ligands. The coefficients
α and β are scaling parameters55,70,71 for the nonpolar and polar terms, respectively.
In the standard LIE model, α has a value of 0.18, whereas β
depends on the chemical nature of the ligand. The IRAP active site
has a divalent Zn2+ ion together with a cluster of carboxylates,
causing very large electrostatic interaction energies with the ligands.
Because these interaction energies, particularly those involving the
Zn2+ ion, will be very sensitive to the force field parameters,
we follow a protocol used earlier for binding sites containing ions57 and treated as a free parameter. An electrostatic
correction term62 was added to account
for the long-range interactions of the charged sulfonamides with the
neglected charges of the neutralized titratable residues. This term
was calculated as ΔGcorrel = 0.64 kcal/mol following the relationship 2  where qp is the
formal charge of the neglected ionic group, whereas ql is the partial charge of the ligand atom. The effective
dielectric constant ε was set to 80. The last term γ is
a protein-dependent constant that does not affect the relative binding
free energies70 but is used to offset the
resulting calculated energies to the experimental values. The reported
nonbonded energies correspond to average values over all 10 replicates,
and the corresponding errors are calculated as the standard error
of the mean (SEM).

Experimental binding free energies (ΔGbindexp) were extracted from IC50 values as 3  where c is an assay-specific
constant, which depends on the substrate concentration and the enzymatic Km value.72 This constant
value does not affect the relative free energies and is implicitly
included in the optimized value of γ in eq 1.

Free Energy Perturbation
The relative
binding free
energy between selected pairs of ligands, LIGA and LIGB, was calculated using the free energy perturbation method.
In this method, LIGA is
transformed into LIGB in parallel MD simulations in both
the bound and the reference (water-solvated) state, and the relative
binding free energy is estimated via a standard thermodynamic cycle,
where the free energy of binding is calculated as the difference in
the free energy resulting in transforming each ligand pair, A, B,
in both the bound and the solvated reference state as 4  The free energy difference associated with
the transformation of ligands A to B was calculated using Zwanzig’s
exponential formula73 5  where Um denotes the
effective potential energy function of a particular
FEP window and n is the number of intermediate states. Um is constructed as a linear
combination of the initial (A) and final (B) potentials of the subperturbation 6  where the coupling parameter λm is stepwise incremented from 0 to 1, in
our case
divided into 51 λ-windows, where every window is sampled for
30 ps.
