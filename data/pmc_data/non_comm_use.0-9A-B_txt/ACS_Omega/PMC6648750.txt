Development
of flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) is a
real challenge for the next-generation energy-harvesting applications.
In this paper, we report highly flexible PENGs based on poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF)/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3 and
PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 nanocomposite fibers.
The incorporation of magnetic Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 greatly affects the structural
properties of PVDF nanofibers, especially the polymeric β and
γ phases. In addition, the new composites enhanced the interfacial
compatibility through electrostatic filler–polymer interactions.
Both PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers-based PENGs, respectively, produce
peak-to-peak output voltages of 20 and 15 V, respectively, with the
corresponding output currents of 0.010 and 0.005 μA/cm2 under the force of 2.5 N. Enhanced output performance of the flexible
nanogenerator is correlated with the electroactive polar phases generated
within the PVDF, in the presence of the nanomaterials. The designed
nanogenerators respond to human wrist movements with the highest output
voltage of 0.15 V, for the PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 when subjected to hand movements. The overall piezoelectric power
generation is correlated with the nanoparticle size and the existing
filler–polymer and ion–dipole interactions.

1 Introduction
Harvesting
electrical energy from kinetic energy during various
dynamic activities has attracted a wide research interest due to its
renewable nature and easy availability.1−3 Several studies have
been conducted on electroactive polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(PVDF) and its copolymers like poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene)
[P(VDF-TrFE)] and poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VDF-HFP)]
in fabricating piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG). These polymers
possess outstanding piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and pyroelectricity.4−6 They have various applications in transducers, sensors, and actuators
because of their unique structural polymorphs.7−9 In the semicrystalline
PVDF, five polymorphs, α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ,
are present, among which the electroactive β phase is the most
polar and it is responsible for the high piezoelectric responses.
To improve the piezoelectric performance of PVDF through β-phase
nucleation, high field electric poling (70–80 MV/m) is often
done. However, this external electric poling technique is cost-intensive,
inconvenient, and not at all an industrial-friendly technique for
large-scale manufacturing.10,11

One of the promising
alternatives in this regard is the self-polarized
PVDF-based PENG. Karan et al. developed PENGs based on self-polarized
PVDF containing iron-doped reduced graphene oxide (Fe-RGO) nanosheets,
without applying any electrical poling technique during fabrication.12 They achieved high piezoelectric properties
due to the presence of Fe-RGO nanofillers in the nanocomposite. The
influence of ferrite nanoparticles in promoting electroactive β-phase
nucleation is also reported in other studies.13,14 Hoque et al.15 fabricated PVDF films
containing Er3+ and Fe3+ ions and investigated
their piezoelectric properties in correlation with the electroactive
β-phase nucleation and dielectric properties. They also reported
the enhancement in the dielectric properties and crystallinity of
PVDF by rare earth ion incorporation.16 Cerium(III)/yttrium(III) nitrate hexahydrate in PVDF,17 lanthanum(III) chloride in PVDF, ErCl3 and GdCl3 in PVDF, etc.16 also
substantiated enhanced dielectric properties and electroactive β-phase
nucleation due to the less capability of covalent bond formation.
Thus, the transition-metal cations influence the PVDF properties by
affecting its chemical environment through covalent interactions.18

Even though there are several studies
on the incorporation of rare
earth ions in PVDF, most preparation methods have followed solution
routes. A few reports also show PVDF nanofiber membranes with enhanced
β-phase crystallinity using electrospinning technology. Such
electrospun PVDF nanofibers report strong piezoelectricity omitting
the need of further electrical poling treatments.19−24 This is mainly because of the dipolar alignment induced by the presence
of high voltage during spinning. The method of electrospinning has
upraised as an effective method in producing self-poled piezoelectric
nanofibers because of the high stretching forces exerted on electrified
solution jets.25

Herein, we prepared
PVDF nanofibers and its nanocomposites with
Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 at 2 wt % by electrospinning. The magnetic Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 nanomaterials
were synthesized by the hydrothermal method, in which the Ce3+ ions control the metal oxide particle crystal size growth to great
extents. The nanoparticles influenced the crystalline structure of
PVDF, and the piezoelectric performance of the PENG is correlated
with the composite’s interfacial crystalline environment. The
PENG based on Ce–Fe2O3 generated an output
voltage of up to 20 V, which was reproducible and stable. Variation
in output voltages of the PENGs was tested with human body movements,
along with its durability. The surface electrostatic interactions
existing within the polymer nanocomposite PENG and the electroactive
β-phase nucleation of PVDF chains in the presence of the nanomaterials
match well with the superior piezoelectric performance of the fabricated
PENGs.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
PVDF pellets of Mw ∼ 275 000
g/mol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
and acetone were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Other reagents such as monoethanolamine [C2H7NO] [MEA], poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG], iron(III)
chloride 6-hydrate, cerium(III) chloride 7-hydrate, and cobalt(II)
chloride 6-hydrate were also commercially obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Synthesis of Pure and Ce-Doped Metal Oxide
Nanoparticles
Required amounts of iron(III) chloride 6-hydrate
and cerium(III) chloride 7-hydrate (with molar ratio Fe/Ce = 1.94:0.06)
were dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water, to which 0.5 g of PEG
was added followed by 3 mL of MEA. The resulting solution was transferred
to an autoclave at 120 °C temperature and kept for 2 h. The obtained
precipitate was washed with water and ethanol several times to remove
the soluble ions, dried at 80 °C for 3 h, followed by calcination
in a tube furnace at 400 °C for 2 h. The obtained Ce–Fe2O3 was used for the analysis and for composite
preparation. A similar process was done for the preparation of Ce–Co3O4 using cobalt(II) chloride 6-hydrate precursor.

2.3 Fabrication of PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 Nanocomposite
Fibers
PVDF pellets were dissolved in a 1:1 DMF/acetone solvent
mixture to obtain a 17% polymer solution by magnetic stirring for
3 h at 70 °C. The magnetic Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 nanoparticles at 2 wt
% were separately dispersed in the same solvent mixture through bath
sonication, then added to the PVDF dissolution, and further magnetically
stirred overnight. These homogeneous dispersions of nanocomposites
were used for electrospinning at 1 mL/h rate, as previously reported
by our team.26 The spun nanofibers were
collected on a cylindrical rotor, rotating at 500 rpm, placed about
10 cm away from the needle tip at an applied voltage of 12 kV. The
obtained nanofibers were silver-electroded on both sides, and a small
PENG was designed by sandwiching between poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS)
sheets.

2.4 Characterization of the Composite Nanofibers
The structural properties of the nanopowders and the polymer composites
were investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex 2, Rigaku,
equipped with Nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1564
nm) operated at 30 V and 15 mA in the 2θ range of 10–30°
at a scanning speed of 1.8°/min) and an Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrometer (PerkinElmer Spectrum 400 spectrophotometer in
the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution
of 2 cm–1). The surface morphology was studied using
a scanning electron microscope (SEM, XL-30E Philips Co., Holland)
and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI TECNAI G2 TEM). The ζ-potential measurements to determine the surface
charge on the nanoparticles were performed by dispersing the nanoparticles
in water using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern) analyzer. X-ray photoelectron
spectrum was recorded using Kratos Axis Ultra DLD. The dielectric
properties were tested by broad-band dielectric/impedance spectroscopy
(Novocontrol) in the frequency range of 10–107 Hz.
The piezoelectric device fabrication and the testing system were similar
to our previous reports.2,26,27

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural
Investigation and Morphology of
Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 Nanomaterials
The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of pure metal oxide (Fe2O3 and Co3O4) nanofillers and their cerium-doped counterparts
reveal interesting crystalline structures (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The diffraction peaks found at 24.1,
33.19, 35.60, 40.88, 49.51, 54.00, 57.58, 62.37, 63.97, 71.87, and
75.47° correspond to the (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116),
(018), (214), (300), (119), and (220) crystal planes, in the case
of Fe2O3. These indexed diffraction peaks match
well with the standard data for hematite Fe2O3 structure (powder diffraction file no. 98-016-4010 ICDD). Similarly,
for the pure and Ce-doped Co3O4, the indexed
diffraction peaks at 19.01, 31.34, 36.87, 38.53, 44.82, 55.67, 59.33,
and 65.19° correspond to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400),
(422), (511), and (440) planes of Co3O4 cubic
phase according to the powder diffraction card no. 98-002-4210 ICDD
(Figure S1b). No other peaks corresponding
to Ce2O3 and other impurities were detected,
which confirms the phase purity of the samples. This also implies
that the crystal structures of Fe2O3 and Co3O4 have not been altered due to the incorporation
of Ce3+ ions. In other words, the Ce3+ ions
are uniformly substituted into the Fe and Co lattice sites. Furthermore,
the decrease in the peak intensity and broadening of the XRD peaks
with incorporation of Ce3+ ions (compared to the undoped
metal oxides) implies smaller crystallite size for the Ce-doped Fe2O3 and Co3O4.

The crystallite
size (D) is calculated by the following Scherrer
equation 1  where
λ is the wavelength of the incident
X-rays, θ is Bragg’s angle of diffraction, and β
is the full width at half-maximum.28 The
calculated crystallite size was 45 nm for pure Fe2O3, whereas a smaller crystallite size of 39 nm was observed
for the Ce-doped Fe2O3. Similarly, the crystallite
sizes for Co3O4 and Ce-doped Co3O4 were 32 and 29 nm, respectively. For both Ce-doped metal
oxides, the crystallite sizes were decreased, due to the lattice distortion
and strain induced by the Ce3+ ion substitutions, which
in turn deteriorate the Fe2O3 and Co3O4 crystallinity.29 The smaller
crystallite size is an important parameter for the enhancement in
output power of the PENG designed out of it as well.30

The morphology of the synthesized nanomaterials is
demonstrated
in Figure 1. The SEM
and TEM images in Figure 1a–c for the 3 wt % Ce-doped Fe2O3 show spherical morphology and uniform distribution with less agglomeration.
From the SEM and TEM images of 3 wt % Ce-doped Co3O4 samples (Figure 1d–f), the cubic morphology is identified. These results
suggest that the Fe2O3 and Co3O4 lattices were not much disturbed by the incorporation of
Ce3+ ions. The high-resolution TEM images of the 3 wt %
Ce-doped Fe2O3 and 3 wt % Ce-doped Co3O4 samples reveal fringe spacings of 1.4 and 1.2 Å,
respectively, corresponding to the (214) and (226) crystal planes
of Fe2O3 and Co3O4 nanomaterials.

TEM images of (a–c) 3 wt % Ce-doped Fe2O3 and (d–f) 3 wt % Ce-doped Co3O4 samples.

3.2 Structural
Properties and Morphology of PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 Nanofibers
Figure 2 shows the
XRD patterns of neat PVDF and its nanocomposites
containing Fe2O3, Ce–Fe2O3, Co3O4, and Ce–Co3O4 nanomaterials. The electroactive β- and γ-phases
are evaluated from the deconvoluted XRD plots, as indicated in Figure 2. The indexed diffraction
peaks at 2θ values of 18.3 and 26.8° correspond to the
(020) and (021) planes of α-crystalline phase.31,32 The diffraction peaks at 20.6° (200/110) and 20.1° (110)
are attributed to the presence of β-phase with the coexistence
of the γ phase.33,34 The two α-characteristic
peaks for neat PVDF were diminished with the addition of nano-Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 into
the PVDF matrix and only the electroactive γ and β phases
were observed. The improved electroactive phase formation is clear
from the XRD peaks of the Ce-doped metal oxides containing PVDF. These
electroactive phases are responsible for the enhancement in the piezoelectric
properties of PVDF-based PENGs.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of (a) neat PVDF and PVDF/2
wt % Fe2O3 and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3 nanofibers
and (b) neat PVDF and PVDF/2 wt % Co3O4 and
PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers.

FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful
tool to study the crystalline phase
formation in PVDF nanocomposites. Figure 3 shows the FTIR spectra of neat PVDF and
PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/2 wt %
Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers. The absorption bands
observed at 976, 796, 764, and 611 cm–1 correspond
to the nonpolar α-phase of PVDF, whereas the characteristic
peaks at 1276, 1233, and 837 cm–1 correspond to
the electroactive β and γ-phases.35−37 All of the
characteristic absorption bands due to the α-phase diminish
in the case of PVDF composite nanofibers, compared to the neat polymer,
and only the characteristic absorption bands due to electroactive
β and γ-phases exist. In addition, the intensities of
both β and γ-phases of PVDF characteristic bands were
increased for the Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 filled fibers compared to the neat PVDF.

Figure 3 FTIR patterns
of neat PVDF and PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers
in the regions 1600–500 cm–1 (a, b), 3600–2800
cm–1 (c, d), and 3100–2900 cm–1 (e, f).

This is due to the interfacial
interaction between the nanofillers
(both Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4) and −CH2–/–CF2– dipoles of the PVDF chain, which leads to the formation
of electroactive phases.38 These interfacial
interactions are also demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and ζ-potential studies, described in the following sections
of this study. Figure 3c,d shows FTIR spectra in the 3600–2800 cm–1 region, indicating the formation of intermolecular H-bonds between
PVDF and the magnetic nanomaterials.39 The
two fundamental vibrational bands for −CH2–
asymmetric (νas) and symmetric (νs) stretching vibrations were shifted to lower-frequency region, due
to the same interfacial interaction caused by the positively charged
surface of the Ce-doped Fe2O3 and Co3O4 nanofillers and −CF2– dipoles
of the PVDF matrix.40

The relative
fraction of the electroactive γ-phase content
(F(γ)) in the PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers
is calculated by using the following equation34 2  where Aα and Aγ are the areas of absorption
peaks for the α and γ phases (at 764 and 837 cm–1), respectively; Xα and Xγ, respectively, represent the crystallinities
of the α and γ phases; and Kα and Kγ are the absorption coefficients
with values of 0.365 and 0.150 μm–1, respectively.
According to the equation, the γ-phase contents in the PVDF
and its nanocomposites were estimated as shown in Table S1. The relative electroactive γ-phase fraction
was found to be higher for the PVDF nanocomposites than for the neat
PVDF. These results can be attributed to the smaller crystallite sizes
of Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 nanoparticles. Liu et al.41 also suggested similar stabilization of γ-phase due to the
positive charges present in the nanoparticles that interact with the
−CF2– dipoles of the PVDF chains.

The
SEM images of neat PVDF and its composite nanofibers are shown
in Figure 4. The nanofibers
are smoother and defect-free as observed. In the PVDF composite nanofibers,
the nanoparticles are well dispersed within the polymer as beads are
not observed on the surfaces, which is due to an increased charge
density of the polymer solution.42 In addition,
no surface defects/cracks are observed on the surface of the composite
nanofibers. These results suggest the flexibility of the nanocomposite
fibers, and moreover the magnetic Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 nanomaterials did not
make the polymer brittle.43 Further investigation
on the average fiber diameter for both PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 (205 ± 45 nm) and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 (262 ± 50 nm) nanofibers reveals a higher value
for the latter. The morphology of the nanofibers was further investigated
by TEM (Supporting Information, Figure S2). The TEM images of PVDF nanofibers containing Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4 nanoparticles
demonstrate the uniform filler distribution in PVDF without any aggregation.

Figure 4 SEM images
of neat PVDF (a), PVDF/2 wt % Fe2O3 (b), PVDF/2
wt % Ce–Fe2O3 (c), PVDF/2
wt % Co3O4 (d), and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 (e) samples. The inset shows the distribution
of fiber diameter for the composite nanofibers containing Ce-doped
metal oxides.

The filler–polymer
interfacial interactions were further
investigated by XPS.44,45Figure 5 shows the XPS images of neat PVDF and PVDF/2
wt % Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers. The strong peaks appearing at 282–288
and 688 eV correspond to the fluorine and carbon atoms in the PVDF
skeleton. The C 1s spectrum of PVDF and its composite nanofibers are
shown in Figure 5c,d.
The strong peaks at 282 and 283 eV correspond to the −CH2 and −CF2 groups of PVDF.46,47 In the XPS images, the peak intensity was increased and shifted
for composite nanofibers, which suggests higher interfacial interaction
existing between the PVDF dipoles and Ce-doped Fe2O3 and Ce-doped Co3O4 nanomaterials. Moreover,
the increased peak intensity in the XPS images is ascribed to the
existence of magnetic nanoparticles, which is in good agreement with
the XRD and FTIR results for interfacial interactions.

3.3 Electroactive β and γ-Phase Formation
Mechanism in PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co2O3 Nanofibers
The formation of electroactive
β and γ-phases has been confirmed by the XRD and FTIR
results, by which an increase in electroactive phase nucleation was
noted with the introduction of magnetic nanoparticles. It is necessary
to study the interaction between the magnetic nanoparticles and PVDF
matrix since it promotes the formation of the electroactive phase.
The transformation of α-phase to the electroactive β-phase
in PVDF may be due to the electrostatic interaction between the PVDF
matrix and the magnetic nanoparticles.48 Karan et al. suggested that the addition of positively charged iron-doped
reduced graphene oxide interacts with the −CF2–
dipoles of PVDF matrix and causes the crystallization transformation
from α-phase to γ-phase.12 He
et al. also addressed the formation of electroactive phases by the
electrical interfacial interaction between the positively charged
organosilicate surface and the partially negative −CF2– bonds of the PVDF matrix.49

To address the surface electrostatic interactions between the cerium-doped
metal oxides and the PVDF chains, ζ-potential studies are rather
necessary. The surface electrostatic charges of the Ce-doped Fe2O3 and Ce-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles
obtained from the ζ-potential analysis are demonstrated in Figure 6a,b. From these results,
the surfaces of the magnetic nanoparticles were identified to be positively
charged, which interact with the −CF2– dipoles
of PVDF via local ion–dipole electrostatic interactions. These
electrostatic interactions lead to the formation of electroactive
phases within the polymer units. Thus, the surface of each nanoparticle
acts as a nucleation center for the formation of electroactive phases.
The proposed interfacial interaction mechanism between the magnetic
nanoparticles and the PVDF matrix is schematically represented in Figure 6c. A similar effect
of interaction with the positively charged nanoparticles and the −CF2– dipoles of the PVDF chains, through which the stabilization
of γ-phase was achieved was reported by Liu et al.41 Moreover, Liang et al. suggested the formation
of electroactive phases in PVDF due to the ion–dipole interactions
between the positively charged molecules and −CF2– dipoles in PVDF or the negatively charged molecules and
the −CH2– dipoles in PVDF chains.50

positively charged nanoparticles and PVDF molecules.

3.4 Crystallization Behavior
of PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co2O3 Nanofibers
Figure 7 displays the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) curves
of neat PVDF, PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3, and
PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 samples. Here, the
observed exothermic peak corresponds to the crystallization temperature
of neat PVDF and its composite nanofibers. Compared to the neat PVDF,
the crystallization temperature was higher for the composite fibers.
These results further confirm the nucleating action of nanofillers
and their role in accelerating the PVDF crystallization.51

Figure 7 (a, b) DSC thermograms of PVDF, PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3, and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4.

The degree of crystallinity was
calculated by using the following
equation 3  where ΔHm is the
melting enthalpy of the nanocomposites and ΔHmo is the melting enthalpy of the 100% crystalline
PVDF (104.5 J/g).52 The degree of crystallinity
values thus calculated are tabulated in Table S1 (Supporting Information). It is found that the composite
nanofibers containing Ce–Fe2O3 and Ce–Co3O4, respectively, show crystallinity values of
43.6 and 43.2% compared to the neat PVDF fiber (41.2%). This higher
percentage of crystallinity achieved for the nanocomposite suggests
the electroactive β-phase formation26 further and is in good correlation with the XRD and FTIR analyses.

3.5 Dielectric Properties of PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co2O3 Nanofibers
Figure 8 shows the
frequency-dependent dielectric properties of neat
PVDF and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/2
wt % Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers. Both dielectric
constant and loss values increase in the low-frequency region and
decrease in the high-frequency region. The increase in dielectric
constant and its reduction with increasing frequency is attributed
to the high interfacial polarization originated from the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars
polarization effect, which causes the accumulation of charge carriers
at the PVDF/nanoparticles interface.53−55 Paria et al. also suggested
a similar increase in dielectric constant due to the decrease in filler–filler
distances and higher dipole–dipole polarization in the nanocomposites.56

Figure 8 Variation of dielectric constant (a, b) and dielectric
loss (c,
d) of the PVDF and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers
with frequency.

The observed dielectric
constants for the PVDF composites of Ce-doped
Fe2O3 and Ce-doped Co3O4 were higher than that of neat PVDF, and the values were, respectively,
14 and 12. This is because of the large accumulation of charge carriers
at the interface between magnetic nanoparticles and PVDF. Thakur et
al. illustrated that the small crystallite size with large surface
area of nanoparticles leads to good homogeneous dispersion in the
polymer and creates large interfacial areas between the nanoparticles
and PVDF matrix. This causes large accumulation of the charge carriers
and enhanced dielectric constant.57 The
conductivity values of the composites (Supporting Information, Figure S3) increased with increasing frequency,
and the values were in the order of 10–14 S/cm in
the lower-frequency region for all PVDF fibers studied. This also
suggests the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars effect existing
in the interface of PVDF/nanoparticles.18

3.6 Piezoelectric Properties of PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co2O3 Nanofibers
Both PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 electrospun fiber
mats were cut into smaller circular pieces of 2 cm diameter and electroded
on both sides using aluminum foil and silver paste. Separate wires
were also attached on both sides and the piezoelectric output performances
were recorded with the help of an already established setup.26,27 This assembled setup contains a vibrating shaker, on top of which
the sample will be placed with a force of 2.5 N. Depending on the
input values in frequency generator, the shaker vibrates, causing
a compressive force on the sample by means of the force applied on
it. These mechanical vibrations were transformed to electrical potential
differences, which is obtained by a data acquisition system. Both
sides of the samples were connected directly to a resistor box, the
variations of which can optimize the best output current and voltage
and thus the power. The generated output voltage from the PVDF-based
fiber PENG as a function of time is shown in Figure 9a,b. The schematic representation of the
PENG is also shown in the same figure. The highest output peak-to-peak
voltages of 20 and 15 V were, respectively, observed for the PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers, much higher than the neat PVDF. All of the composite
nanofibers showed excellent output performance without requiring any
external electric poling and direct contact with the device.19 The enhanced output voltages for the nanofibers
containing Ce-doped metal oxides may be due to the induced electroactive
phases within the composite and the electrostatic interactions between
the nanomaterials and the PVDF. This interaction played a significant
role in inducing self-polarization within the composites.58 The interaction between the nanoparticles and
the PVDF chains improved the polarization ordering and increased the
stability of the molecular chain that lead to a better degree of alignment
of the dipoles. Finally, the dipoles of the PVDF molecules were self-polarized
along specific directions due to the effect of stress- and surface
charge-induced polarization. Mandal et al. also made a similar observation
that the improvement in output voltage comes from the large content
of electroactive β-phase and self-poling induced by the presence
of Ag nanoparticles in PVDF-HFP.42 Moreover,
the crystal deformation in the nanocomposites has a significant effect
on the output performance of the flexible PENG.59,39 These variable dipoles within the nanocomposite depends on the nature
of filler material and the charge–discharge processes taking
place upon mechanical deformation. And this is the reason for the
small variations in the output voltage characteristics observed in
the case of PVDF nanocomposites.

Figure 9 (a–d) Output voltages and output
currents from the piezoelectric
nanogenerator fabricated with neat PVDF and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/2 wt % Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers.

The piezoelectric output current performance is shown in Figure 9c,d. The maximum
output currents for the PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers were 2.2
and 1.44 μA, respectively. The piezoelectric output power can
be calculated by using the following relation. 4  The power density values obtained for the
PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 composite fibers were 700.64 and 334.39 μA/cm3, respectively. As reported earlier in the structure and morphology
of the nanocomposites, the enhanced output performance of the PENG
is due to the better dispersion of nanoparticles in the PVDF.60 In other words, the enhanced piezoelectric output
can be attributed to the combinational effect of the oriented electroactive
phase and the surface electrostatic interaction between the nanoparticles
and the PVDF matrix. It is also noteworthy that the Ce–Fe2O3 composite possesses comparatively higher performance
than Ce–Co3O4, which again can be correlated
with the morphology and surface interactions. The spherical uniform
structure of Ce–Fe2O3 allows maximum
surface area to interact with the PVDF chains, whereas the cubic structures
sometimes hinder the polymer chains from good electrostatic interactions.
Moreover, the particle sizes were also found to be lower for Ce–Fe2O3. Finally, the resultant output voltage and output
current for the PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers reveal the application of PENGs in
many low-powered portable electronic devices.

The stability
of the piezoelectric output performance is also investigated
by monitoring the output voltage for a few hours.61 This is represented in Figure S4 (Supporting Information), from which the long-term stability (over
2 h) for the two systems, PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers, is evidenced.

To check the real-time applications of the fabricated PENGs, the
one containing Ce–Fe2O3 (with comparatively
high power) was tested for the bending movements. Figure 10a shows the bending and releasing
movements of the flexible PENG and its output performance. The observed
positive and negative piezo-voltage peaks correspond to the bending
and releasing vibrations. Later, the PENG is attached to the human
wrist and the piezoelectric responses based on wrist movements are
recorded (Figure 10b). In both bending and human wrist movements, the output voltage
shows a notable variation indicating the application of the PENG in
fabricating self-powering devices.

the PENG based on PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3. (b)
Output performance when subjected to wrist
movements. (c) Schematic illustration of the piezoelectric effect.

A schematic diagram for the piezoelectric
mechanism occurring in
a PVDF nanocomposite is shown in Figure 10c. When there is no applied force onto the
sample, the net dipoles within the nanocomposites cancel each other,
resulting in lower potential across the material. However, when a
mechanical force is applied to the PVDF nanofiber, a potential is
created in the magnetic nanoparticles and helps the PVDF dipoles to
align through stress-induced polarization. This self-polarization
is responsible for the high piezoelectric output performance. Most
of the polymer nanocomposites show piezoelectricity because of such
self-polarization induced by the nanoparticles. And in addition, this
self-polarization depends on the nature and type of nanomaterials,
their alignment, and the surface electrostatic interfacial interactions
between the polymer and the nanomaterials.

4 Conclusions
We have successfully prepared new PVDF composite nanofibers using
the electrospinning technique. Both the Ce-doped Fe2O3 and Ce-doped Co3O4 magnetic nanoparticles-loaded
PVDF nanofibers showed enhanced β-phase crystallinity and piezoelectric
property compared to the neat PVDF due to smaller crystallite size
distribution and higher electrostatic interfacial interaction. The
self-polarization, small crystallite size, and high β-phase
crystallinity of PVDF upon nanoparticles loading have a significant
influence on the enhanced piezoelectric property of PVDF/Ce–Fe2O3 and PVDF/Ce–Co3O4 nanofibers. The application of PENGs based on these nanocomposites
is demonstrated by the bending and human wrist movements. In both
movements, the output voltage was generated, confirming the successful
use of the obtained PVDF nanocomposite in flexible self-powering devices.
