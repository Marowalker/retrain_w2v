A Förster
resonance energy-transfer (FRET)-based ratiometric
fluorescent indicator Cou-FITC-Si toward fluoride ion
has been designed and synthesized by combining coumarin unit and fluorescein
derivative as energy donor and acceptor, respectively. The fluorescein
unit is capped with tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane.
The indicator gives out emission responses based on switch-on of the
FRET process that triggered by the desilylation mediated by the fluoride
ion. The fluorescence emission spectrum of Cou-FITC-Si presents a significant bathochromic shift of 59 nm after the addition
of fluoride ion with up to 180-fold increase of the fluorescence intensity
ratio. The limit of detection of the Cou-FITC-Si indicator
system toward fluoride ion was estimated to be 3.3 ppb. Furthermore,
this indicator has been successfully applied for quantifying the fluoride
ion of different concentrations from commercially available toothpaste.

Introduction
Numerous anions and
cations are realized to play indispensable
roles in human life, and considerable attention has been drawn to
developing detecting systems toward them.1 Among these anions and cations, fluoride ion is one of the most
important anions because of its significance for health and environmental
issues. Appropriate ingestion of fluoride is beneficial to our dental
and skeletal health, but excessive intake of fluoride may cause fluorosis,
nephrolithiasis, or even osteosarcoma.2−4 The World Health Organization
(WHO), European Union (EU), United States, China, and many other countries
have established standards for fluoride in drinking water. The primary
standard of 4 mg/L and secondary standard of 2 mg/L of fluoride in
drinking water have been given to prevent osteofluorosis and to protect
against dental fluorosis, respectively, by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) of United States. In addition, a recommended range of
0.7–1.2 mg/L of fluoride in drinking water has been proposed
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which has
been adjusted based on the most recent scientific data in 2011.5 Accurate measurement of the levels of fluoride
in water, environment, and biosystems is essential for scientific
and healthy benefit. Although the ion-selective electrode, ion chromatography,
and Willard–Winter methods are commonly applied for quantitative
fluoride measurements,6−8 however, some disadvantages such as high cost, complicated
procedures, and low mobility still remain. Therefore, it is appealing
to develop convenient and inexpensive methods for highly selective
and sensitive detection of fluoride in aqueous environments.

Fluorescent chemosensors have been shown advantages for the detection
of fluoride over the past decade because of their high sensitivity
and specificity, fast response, and potential for real-time monitoring.9 Various fluorescent chemosensors of fluoride
based on supramolecular interactions such as anion−π
interactions, hydrogen bonding, and Lewis acid coordination have been
reported,10−18 but a lot of them are not suitable for the detection of fluoride
in aqueous solutions, which limits the application in aqueous medium
or biological systems. To improve the performance of fluoride sensors,
a strategy based on the fluoride-triggered desilylation has been developed
for recognition of fluoride ion.19 On the
basis of this strategy, several fluoride chemosensors have been reported
and applied successfully for the detection of fluoride ion in water
and biologic targets.20−22 However, most of them are intensity-based sensors,
which is significantly affected by various external factors including
microenvironment (pH value and polarity), sample thickness, excitation
power, detector response, and so forth. In contrast, chemosensors
based on ratiometric fluorescence can overcome the shortcomings of
fluorescence intensity-based ones because they offer an internal calibration
by recording the ratios of emission intensities of two different bands.
Furthermore, the ratiometric fluorescence provides direct fluorescence
color variations other than intensity, which is more convenient to
distinguish F– from other anions by naked eyes.23−26 Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most
commonly applied mechanisms for ratiometric fluorescent chemosensors.
The FRET process can be tuned or ceased by regulating the absorption
of acceptor or/and enlarging the separation of donor and acceptor,
resulting in emission spectra change and consequent reporting. However,
FRET-based fluoride sensing is challenging because of the limitation
of matching FRET chromophore pairs and fluoride-triggered spectra
changes, and few examples were achieved.27 In this work, a fluoride indicator (Cou-FITC-Si) with
high sensitivity and selectivity is designed and created by taking
advantages of ratiometric fluorescence provided by FRET and the selectivity
of fluoride-triggered desilylation. A coumarin chromophore and a silyl-protected
fluorescein derivative of spirolactam form are selected as the energy
donor and the acceptor, respectively. They are linked covalently with
a short linker to ensure that the donor and the acceptor are close
enough for effective FRET. The coumarin unit and fluorescein chromophore
is an elegant chromophore pair with FRET-on/off functions.28 FRET is inefficient between the coumarin unit
and the fluorescein of spirolactam form with silyl capped because
of the negligible spectral overlap between the donor emission and
the acceptor absorption. In the presence of fluoride, the fluorescein
spirolactam unit proceeds desilylation and consequently transforms
into a ring-open structure (fluorescein), leading to a large bathochromic
shift of its absorption. The intramolecular FRET process is then activated
between the coumarin and the ring-open structure of fluorescein (Scheme 1). Therefore, the
sensing system exhibits a dual fluorescence feature based on the fluoride-induced
FRET, providing a measurement of fluoride with a ratiometric fluorescence.
The indicator has been successfully applied in quantitative detection
of fluoride in aqueous phase and toothpastes.

Scheme 1 Structure and Proposed
Sensing Mechanism of Cou-FITC-Si for the Detection of
F–
Results and Discussion
Cou-FITC-Si was
obtained by an efficient reaction
of the amino group of 2-(aminoethyl)-carbamothioyl]-5-aminofluorescein
(1) with 7-(diethylamino)-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-succinimidyl
ester (2) and a following silylation with tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane. The synthetic route is depicted in Scheme 2, and the preparation
of compounds 1 and 2 was synthesized according
to the reported methods.29,30 The structure of Cou-FITC-Si was characterized by means of 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), and IR spectra.
The solubility of Cou-FITC-Si in water is poor. For application
of Cou-FITC-Si in detection of fluoride in aqueous environment
and oral care products, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was
used to solubilize the hydrophobic indicator molecule in the aqueous
phase.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Route of Cou-FITC-Si
The sensing ability of the Cou-FITC-Si aqueous dispersion
([Cou-FITC-Si] = 2.5 μM, [CTAB] = 30 mM) for fluoride
was examined by measuring the absorption and emission spectra in the
presence of different amounts of sodium fluoride (Figure 1). An absorption band with
maximum at 420 nm assigned to the coumarin group dominates the absorption
spectrum of Cou-FITC-Si in the absence of fluoride. The
addition of fluoride ion to the dispersion of Cou-FITC-Si results in the appearance of an absorption band centered at ca.
500 nm in company with the absorption of the coumarin group. The absorption
band is enhanced with increasing amounts of fluoride ion and is assigned
to the fluorescein chromophore produced by the desilylation and the
sequent ring-open transformation. Upon selective excitation of coumarin
part with 420 nm light, a fluorescence characteristic of the coumarin
with maximum at 464 nm was observed in the absence of fluoride ion,
indicating that no detectable FRET process from the coumarin group
to the fluorescein chromophore of spirolactam form occurs, which is
rationalized by the lack of spectra overlap between the donor and
acceptor. When the dispersion of Cou-FITC-Si was treated
with sodium fluoride, selective excitation of the coumarin group results
in not only the decrease of fluorescence emission of coumarin but
also the appearance of a new emission band with maximum at ca. 523
nm which is assigned to the fluorescence of the fluorescein chromophore.
The observation of fluorescence change of Cou-FITC-Si is caused by the occurrence of the intramolecular FRET process from
coumarin unit to the fluorescein part. The fluoride ion induces the
desilylation of the spirolactam form of fluorescein, which further
transforms to the fluorescein structure. Because the absorption of
fluorescein overlaps with the fluorescence emission of coumarin, the
intramolecular FRET process is switched on, giving the green fluorescence
of fluorescein. Upon increasing the concentrations of fluoride ion,
the emission of the fluorescein chromophore increases, accompanying
with a gradual decrease of the coumarin fluorescence around 464 nm.
The inset of Figure 1b presents the fluorescence color change of the Cou-FITC-Si dispersion before and after the addition of 100 μM NaF, showing
the visual observation of fluoride ion in water. The fluorescence
quantum yield of Cou-FITC-Si aqueous suspension in the
absence of fluoride is estimated to be 0.18, by using coumarin 343
in acetonitrile with a quantum yield of 0.75 as a reference. After
desilylation by fluoride, the fluorescence quantum yield of the indicator
reaches 0.45.

F– of various concentrations (0–200 μM).
λex = 420 nm.

The ratio of emission intensities at 523 and 464 nm (I523/I464) was used
as the
indicator for ratiometric quantification of fluoride ion. The relationship
between the ratios of fluorescence intensities I523/I464 and the concentrations
of fluoride ion is depicted in Figure 2 and shows two distinct linear regions (≤25
and ≥50 μM), which may be caused by the different local
concentrations and reaction dynamics at low and high concentrations
of fluoride ion.25,26 The linear regions suggest that Cou-FITC-Si is a potential chemodosimeter for quantitative
determination of the levels of fluoride ion in drinking water. Importantly,
up to 180-fold increase of the value of I523/I464 was observed after the addition
of 200 μM (3.8 mg/L) F–, indicative of high
potential for sensitive F– determination. The limit
of detection (LOD) was then determined according to the 3σ standard:
LOD = 3σ/k, where σ is the standard deviation
of the intensity ratio (I523/I464) obtained by measuring the indicator solutions in
the absence of fluoride ions (σ = 0.00145 in this work) and k is the slope of linear fitting of the working cure in
the low F– concentration region (0.025 μM–1, Figure 2). The LOD of Cou-FITC-Si indicator system toward
F– was estimated to be 3.3 ppb (∼0.17 μM),
which is one of the best sensitivities reported in water and is adequately
sensitive enough for fluoride ion detection in various aqueous samples.
Selected fluoride probes for fluoride detection in water based on
desilylation are listed in Table 1 for comparison.22,31−33 The probe developed in this work provides the first successful example
of FRET molecular probe for fluoride ion in water. The distinct spectral
shift and the large ratiometric enhancement make Cou-FITC-Si one of the most sensitive indicators for fluoride ion, which extends
the design way for fluorescence sensing fluoride ion.

respectively.

The selectivity of the sensing system
was further assessed by measuring
the fluorescence response of Cou-FITC-Si toward a series
of anions (in the form of sodium salts), including Br–, H2PO4–, AcO–, NO3–, SO42–, Cl–, F–, HSO4–, CO32–, and HCO3–. The fluorescence spectra of the indicator dispersion
were recorded after 30 min upon the addition of 40 equiv of the anions
listed above. Only fluoride ion induce a remarkable red shift of the
fluorescence maximum from 464 to 523 nm because of the formation of
the open-ring form of fluorescein (Scheme 1), giving a considerable change of the ratio
of fluorescence intensities at 523 and 464 nm (I523/I464). Weak acid anions can
induce slightly spectral changes, which may be attributed to the gradual
hydrolysis of the siloxane unit induced by the basic species in aqueous
solution with weak acid anions. The hydrolysis nature of siloxane
in basic aqueous solution makes the indicator not to tolerate strong
basicity environments, although the speed is much slower that the
desilylation with fluoride. All other anions induce negligible changes
in I523/I464, as shown in Figure 3. Thiourea was a common unit used for fluoride sensing especially
in the organic medium. To evaluate if the thiourea connection unit
is involved in the sensing process, the absorption and emission spectra
of the aqueous indicator dispersion were examined after reaction with
different amounts of fluoride for extended period (Figure S4). No substantial spectra difference and interference
caused by the thiourea unit were found. These results indicate that
the Cou-FITC-Si dispersion is highly selective for recognizing
fluoride ion over other common anions, which is attributed to the
trigger mechanism based on the specific reaction between fluoride
and silyl.

Figure 3 (a) Emission intensity ratios (I523/I464) and (b) fluorescence spectra of Cou-FITC-Si (2.5 μM) aqueous dispersions (CTAB 30 mM)
upon incubation with 40 equiv of Br–, H2PO4–, AcO–, NO3–, SO42–, Cl–, F–, HSO4–, CO32–, and HCO3– for 30 min (λex = 420 nm).

To evaluate the practical applicability of Cou-FITC-Si for quantitative determining fluoride ion from daily life samples,
the content of fluoride in two representative and commercially available
toothpastes (Crest and Darlie) was determined. A certain weight of
the toothpastes was mixed with different volumes of deionized water;
the liquid part was extracted from the suspension by centrifugation
and filtration (three extracts of different concentrations for each
toothpaste product). Upon addition of a certain amount of each extract
to the Cou-FITC-Si dispersion, the ratiometric response
of the indicator was recorded and the corresponding fluoride ion concentration
was calculated according to the fitting cures in Figure 2. As listed in Table 2, the determined fluoride ion
concentration was in good agreement with the expected fluoride ion
concentrations with good recovery (97–100%), suggesting that Cou-FITC-Si can be used for quantifying the fluoride ion of
different concentrations in many oral care products and aqueous samples.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a FRET-based ratiometric fluorescent indicator Cou-FITC-Si has been successfully developed for highly specific
and sensitive detection of fluoride ion in aqueous. The indicator
shows coumarin emission in the blue region without FRET occurring
in the absence of fluoride ion. When fluoride ion is added, the desilylation
reaction in the fluorescein part is triggered and the fluorescein
of spirolactam form transforms into open-ring form, leading to bathochromic
shift of the fluorescein absorption and the consequent switched-on
of FRET process. As a result, the fluorescence spectra of Cou-FITC-Si presented a ratiometric fluorescence response and fluorescence color
changed from blue to green can be observed by naked eyes. Cou-FITC-Si is selectively responsive toward fluoride, and the detection limit
of Cou-FITC-Si dispersion toward F– is estimated to be 3.3 ppb. Practical application of the indicator
for fluoride ion determination in toothpaste samples was demonstrated,
and good recovery was obtained under various concentrations, showing
the potential of the indicator in detecting F– in
daily life and other aqueous samples.
