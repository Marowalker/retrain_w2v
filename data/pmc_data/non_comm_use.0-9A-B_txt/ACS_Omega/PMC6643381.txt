Two
novel layer structure compounds, Cs2HgSb4S8 and Cs2Hg2Sb2Se6, were synthesized in organic solvent under solvothermal conditions.
The Cs2HgSb4S8 is formed of [HgSb4S8]2– ribbons and S atoms by
corner sharing. The Cs2Hg2Sb2Se6 is made up of [SbHg2Se6]5– ribbon and disorder trigonal-pyramidal SbSe3 by sharing
μ3-Se. These compounds are characterized by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, solid-state optical absorption
spectra, and so on.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Since
Bedard et al.1 reported the solvothermally
synthesized open-framework structure of tin(IV) sulfides in 1989,
a significant method has been developed in the synthesis of chalcogenides.
Meanwhile, chalcogenides also have been attracting extensive research
interest due to their excellent performance in the fields of semiconductor,
ion exchange, and nonlinear optics.2−9 Very recently, a number of antimony chalcogenides have been continuously
prepared because the stereochemical effect of lone electron pairs
and the various coordinations of stibium by chalcogen atoms can give
rise to large structural and compositional diversities.10,11 In other words, the stibium atom is coordinated with chalcogen atoms
to form pyramidal [SbIIIQ3]3– or tetrahedral [SbVQ4]4– (Q = S, Se) primary units. The pyramidal [SbQ3]3– unit has a powerful tendency of a variety of condensations to form
polynuclear anions which can link by sharing corners or edges to come
into being rings or chains structure. However, the tetrahedral [SbVQ4]4– mostly binds cations directly
to form low-dimensional structure because building chalcogen atoms
need to stay charge balanced.12−14

In recent years, researchers
have focused on the incorporation
of transition metal (TM) ions into antimony chalcogenides to form
novel chalcogenide materials.15 The transition
metal ions contain Co2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+, and they are coordinated with organic amine
to form [TM(amine)n]2+ complex
cations acting as counterions, resulting in low-dimensional structural
antimony chalcogenides.16 A large number
of A-Hg-Sb-Q (A= [TM(amine)n]2+) compounds are
known in which the transition metal ions are integrated into organic
amine frameworks as charge balancing ions, such as [Ni(en)3]0.5HgSbS3 (en = ethylenediamine),17 [Co(en)3]Hg2Sb2S6, [Ni(1,2-dap)3]2HgSb3S7Cl (1,2-dap = 1,2-diaminopropane), [Ni(1,2-dap)3]HgSb2S5, [Mn(dien)2]HgSb2S5 (dien = diethylenetriamine), [TM(tren)]HgSb2S5 (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, tren = tris(2-aminoethyl)amine),
[TM(dien)2]Hg3Sb4S10 (TM
= Mn, Co, Ni),18 [Co(dien)2]HgSb2S5, [Ni(dien)2]HgSb2S5,19 [Mn(phen)]2HgSb2S6 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), [TM(tren)]HgSb2Se5 (TM = Mn, Fe, Co),20 [Ni(1,2-pda)]HgSb2Se5, [Mn(dien)2]HgSb2Se5, [Ni(en)3]Hg2Sb2Se6, [Ni(en)(teta)]Hg2Sb2Se6,21 and [TM(1,2-dap)3]HgSb2Se5 (TM = Co, Fe).22 On the contrary, only a few compounds of antimony
chalcogenides with alkali metal ions or alkaline earth metal ions
as counterions are known. Meanwhile, transition metal ions Ag+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ compared with Co2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, and Mn2+ are
easily formed frameworks of group 15 elements. For example, CsAgSb4S7,23 KCu2SbS3,24 K2MSbS3 (SH) (M = Zn, Cd),25 K3Ag9Sb4S12, Rb3Ag9Sb4S12, Cs3Ag9Sb4S12,26 BaAgSbS3, BaAgSbS3·H2O,27 Rb2Cu2Sb2S5, Cs2Cu2Sb2S5,10 BaCuSbS3, and BaCuSbSe328 were synthesized by the high-temperature
solid-state approach, reactive flux methods, and hydro(solvo)thermal
methods. However, A-Hg-Sb-Q (A= alkali metal cations) antimony chalcogenides
were synthesized relatively little. As far as we know, there are only
a few compounds of KHgSbS3,29 RbHgSbTe3,30 MHgSbSe3 (M = K, Rb, Cs),31 and [tetaH2]0.25Rb0.5HgSbSe3.17 Although most of the mercury(II)–antimony chalcogenides
were synthesized by using organic amines or transition metal complexes
as counterions, alkali metal ions or alkaline earth metal ions as
counterions are still uncommon. In this article, we obtained two new
mercury(II)–antimony chalcogenides Cs2HgSb4S8 (1) and Cs2Hg2Sb2Se6 (2).

2 Results
and Discussion
We have investigated solvent factor in the
synthesis of these compounds.
For compound 1, we used 1,4-diaminobutane as reaction
solvent. Other conditions remained unchanged, and a large number of
small crystals were obtained. When we used 1,2-diaminopropane instead
of 1,4-diaminobutane as the solvent to synthesize compound 2, a very small amount of the crystals was obtained. Their structures
were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.

2.1 Structural
Descriptions
Cs2HgSb4S8 (1)
Compound 1 has a novel layered
structure, in which
the two-dimensional (2D) layered [HgSb4S8]n2n– network is separated by counterions Cs + cations and stack along  the a axis (Figure 1).
The layer can be described as being composed of 12-membered rings
and 16-membered rings. The [SbHgS5]n chain is composed of trigonal–pyramidal Sb(4)S3 units and tetrahedron HgS4 units by corner sharing
(Figure 2a). In trigonal–pyramidal
Sb(4)S3 units, the Sb(4) atom is coordinated by three S
atoms, and the Sb–S distances range from 2.358(6) to 2.461(6)
Å with S–Sb(4)–S angles ranging from 93.0(2) to
96.8(2)° (Table S1). In tetrahedron
HgS4 units, the Hg atom is integrated into four atoms,
and the Hg–S distances range from 2.415(6) to 2.659(6) Å
with angles ranging from 95.0(2) to 133.1(2)°. The Hg–S
bond lengths are similar to the HgS4 tetrahedron of [Ni(en)3]0.5HgSbS3 (Hg–S: 2.456(2)–2.6756(18)
Å) (Table S1).17 In compound 1 appears Sb3S3 six-membered rings, which are composed of three SbS3 units by corner sharing (Figure 2b), and it is similar to some thioantimonates.32,33 The [SbHgS5]n chain and Sb3S3 six-membered rings form the [HgSb4S8]2– ribbon by sharing S(1) and S(5)
self-assembly (Figure 2c). The Sb(3)–S(5) and Sb(2)–S(1) bond lengths are
0.2399(6) Å and 0.2471(6) Å, respectively. Such [HgSb4S8]2– ribbon further fused via
sharing the μ2-S(4) atoms to form a 2-D anionic layer
along the ab plane (Figure 2d). It is worth mentioning that the compound 1 possesses a new type of Hg–Sb–S structure.
Up to now, this structure has been not reported. In addition, Mn2Sb4S8(N2H4)234 and compound 1 have
similar Sb4S8 units, but we found that their
structures are very different. The Mn2Sb4S8(N2H4)2 consists of hydrazine-bridged
neighboring 2-D Mn2Sb4S8 layers to
form 3-D networks.34 Although the Mn2Sb4S8(N2H4)2 and compound 1 are all composed of six-membered
Sb3S3 rings, the formation of the two types
of rings is completely different. There are two different Sb coordination
geometries for SbS4 and SbS5 in Mn2Sb4S8(N2H4)2, while compound 1 only contains trigonal pyramidal
SbS3.

Cs2Hg2Sb2Se6 (2)
The compound 2 has a layered structure.
It consists of the 2-D [Hg2Sb2Se6]2– anion layer, and Cs+ cations stack
along the c axis (Figure 3). The Hg atom is similar to compound 1, coordinated with four Se atoms to form tetrahedron HgSe4 units. In tetrahedron HgSe4 units, Hg–Se
distances range from 2.585(7) to 2.753(10) Å with Se–Hg–Se
angles ranging from 106.7(3) to 120.6(2)°. The [Hg2Se6]n chain consists of tetrahedron
HgSe4 units through sharing Se(1) and Se(4) (Figure 4a). The Sb(3) atom is coordinated
by four Se atoms, forming distorted tetrahedron Sb(3)Se4 units (Figure 4b).
Sb(3)–Se distances range from 2.902(12) to 3.007(12) Å
with Se–Sb(3)–Se angles ranging from 91.2(3) to 174.3(4)°
(Table S2). The ribbon structure is composed
of a [Hg2Se6]n chain
and tetrahedron SbSe4 units by corner sharing (Figure 4c). An anionic layer
is made up of a [SbHg2Se6]n5– ribbon
and two distorted trigonal pyramidal SbSe3 units by sharing
μ3-Se atom self-assembly along the bc plane (Figure 4e).
There are two different types of Sb atoms in the crystal structure.
The main difference is attributable to the coordination environment
of Se atoms. In Sb(3)Se4 units, the Sb(3)–Se bond
lengths are longer than those of other selenioantimonates,35 which are similar to the distorted ψ-SbSe4 trigonal bipyramid of [Mn(dien)2]2Sb4Se9 (Sb2–Se6:2.8087(11) and 3.0002(11) Å).14 In disorded trigonal–pyramidal SbSe3 units (Figure 4d), Sb1 and Sb2 atoms are disordered; the Sb atom is coordinated
by three Se atoms; and Sb–Se distances range from 2.762(15)
to 2.876(15) Å with Se–Sb–Se angles ranging from
95.2(5)–126(2)°. The CsHgSbSe331 and compound 2 have the same stoichiometry
of Cs:Hg:Sb:S (1:1:1:3), while their structure makes a difference.
The CsHgSbSe3 includes terminal Se atoms, while 2 has none. On the other hand, their structures all include [Hg2Se6]n chains, but the
[Hg2Se6]n chains
of CsHgSbSe3 are connected with trigonal pyramidal SbSe3 units to form two-dimensional (2D) anionic layers of 2∞[HgSbSe3]−. The [Hg2Se6]n chains of 2 are connected with tetrahedron SbSe4 units and trigonal pyramidal SbSe3 units, forming
2D anionic layers of [Sb2Hg2Se6]2–. As far as we know, these compounds, which contain
[enH2]0.5HgSbS3, [tetaH2]0.5HgSbS3, [1,2-pdaH]HgSbS3, [tetaH2]0.25Rb0.5HgSbSe3, [Ni(en)3]0.5HgSbS3,17 [Co(en)3]Hg2Sb2S6,18 [Ni(en)3]Hg2Sb2Se6, [Ni(en)(teta)]Hg2Sb2Se6,21 KHgSbS3,29 RbHgSbTe3,30 and MHgSbSe3 (M = K, Rb, Cs),31 and compound 2 have the same stoichiometry of Hg:Sb:Q
(Q = S, Se, Te) (1:1:3). It is different that these compounds are
all composed of ring structure. In contrast, compound 2 appears to have a ribbon structure, and the most interesting is
SbSe4 in compound 2. We found that RbHgSbTe3, RbHgSbSe3, KHgSbSe3, and compound 2 have similar [Hg2Se6]n chains, whereas their counterions are also very
different.

2.2 Optical
Properties
The solid-state
optical absorption spectra indicate that the optical band gaps of
Cs2HgSb4S8 and Cs2Hg2Sb2Se6 are 2.13 and 1.77 eV, respectively
(Figure 5). The band
gaps of 1 show a red shift of the optical absorption
edge compared with those of [enH2]0.5HgSbS3 (2.49 eV), [tetaH2]0.5HgSbS3 (teta = triethylenetetramine) (2.40 eV), [1,2-pdaH]HgSbS3 (2.55 eV), and [Ni(en)3]0.5HgSbS3 (2.68 eV).17 The band gaps of 2 show a blue shift of the optical absorption edge compared with those
of CsHgSbSe3 (1.65 eV),31 RbHgSbSe3 (1.75 eV),30 and [tetaH2]0.25Rb0.5HgSbSe3 (1.42 eV).17

2.3 Thermogravimetric
and Differential Scanning
Calorimeter Analyses
The thermogravimetric (TG) curve of
compounds 1 and 2 shows the weight loss
of 30% and 24%, which corresponds to the collapse of the structure
of the compound. Differeential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curves of
compounds 1 and 2 display the endothermic
peak at 343 and 354 °C, respectively (Figure S2).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have prepared two-layer mercury antimony chalcogenides
Cs2HgSb4S8 and Cs2Hg2Sb2Se6 by the solvothermal method. Two
compouds have a similar ribbon structure, but the structure is different.
Two compounds contain alkali metal ions (Cs+) as counterions,
and transition metal ions (Hg2+) were incorporated into
antimony chalcogenides. The solid-state optical absorption spectra
indicate that two compounds are semiconductors.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
All reagents
and chemicals are analytical and without further purification. The
powder X-ray diffraction is done using a Rigaku XRD-6000 diffractometer
using Cu–Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA (Figure S1). The solid-state optical absorption
spectra are on a Shimadzu UV-2550 double monochromatic sepctrophotometer
over the range of 220–800 nm at the room temperature with Ba2SO4 power as reflectance. The absorption spectrum
data were calculated from the Kubelka–Munk function: α/S = (1 – R)2/2R, where α is the absorption coefficient, S the scattering coefficient, and R the
reflectance.36 Thermogravimetric and differeential
scanning calorimeter analyses were carried out with an STA 449 F5
Jupiter at 30 to 600 °C at 5 °C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere
at 35 mL/min.
