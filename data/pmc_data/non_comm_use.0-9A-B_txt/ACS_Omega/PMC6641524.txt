The
chemically reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared by the
reduction of graphene oxide by hydrazine hydrate. By varying the reduction
time (10 min, 1 h, and 15 h), oxygen functional groups on rGO were
tremendously controlled and they were named RG1, RG2, and RG3, respectively.
Here, we investigate the impact of oxygen functional groups on the
detection of ammonia and toluene at room temperature. Their effect
on sensing mechanism was analyzed by first-principles calculation-based
density functional theory. The sensing material was fabricated, and
the effect of reduction time shown improved the recovery of ammonia
and toluene sensing at room temperature. Structural, morphological,
and electrical characterizations were performed on both RG1 and RG3.
The sensor response toward toluene vapor of 300 ppm was found to vary
4.4, 2.5, and 3.8% for RG1, RG2, and RG3, respectively. Though RG1
shows higher sensing response with poor recovery, RG3 exhibited complete
desorption of toluene after the sensing process with response and
recovery times of approximately 40 and 75 s, respectively. The complete
recovery of toluene molecules on RG3 is due to the generation of new
sites after the reduction of oxygen functionalities on its surface.
It could be suggested that these sites provided anchor to ammonia
and toluene molecules and good recovery under N2 purge.
Both theoretical and experimental studies revealed that tuning the
oxygen functional groups on rGO could play a vital role in the detection
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on rGO sheets and was discussed
in detail. This study could provoke knowledge about rGO-based sensor
dependency with oxygen functional groups and shed light on effective
monitoring of VOCs under ambient conditions for air quality monitoring
applications.

1 Introduction
The
industries such as automotive, oil, chemical, and plastic have
mandated the usage of gas monitors which could be advantageous if
they could be available as a reliable handheld battery-operated device.1 Nowadays, ammonia and toluene are the most common
indoor air pollutants and harmful to human health which are increasing
in earth’s atmosphere along with greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide,
methane, water vapor, and nitrous oxide).2 Toluene is used in the preparation of paints, metal cleaners, plastics,
detergents, and indispensable cancer biomarkers.3,4 Ammonia
has emerged as an indoor atmosphere pollutant which appears mainly
due to the hydrolysis of urea which exists in the antifreeze additives
in concrete buildings.5 There has been
an increased demand to develop a cost-effective, portable, and highly
sensitive device under ambient conditions, which is still a challenging
task to the scientific community. Some spectrometry techniques such
as photoionization and ion mobility were used to measure the trace
detection of volatile organic compounds (VOC), and they are limited
because of their equipment cost and prior sample preparation.4 For the last two decades, metal oxides such as
CeO2, SnO2, WO3, silicon nanowire,
and metal oxide framework have been used for sensing VOCs, chemical
warfare agents, and explosive gases.3,6−10 Nonetheless, these metal oxide-based sensing materials require high
operating temperature and power which complicate the sensing performance.11

Carbon-based nanomaterials have exciting
properties of high surface
area and electron transport under ambient conditions which are the
promising candidate for portable sensors.12,13 Carbon nanotubes,14 fullerenes,15 and carbon-based composites16 were widely demonstrated as ambient condition sensor materials.
Recently, a new generation of toxic gas sensing materials was demonstrated
using two-dimensional nanostructures like graphene-based materials.17−19 The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) consists of oxygen functional groups
partially decorated on the graphene sheets with π–π
bonds and defect [missing of carbon atom in its series (i.e., holes)]19 sites which act as active sites to the analyte
molecules. Therefore, rGO-based sensing materials have become a potential
competitor for the above-mentioned materials.

In this paper,
the effect of oxygen functional groups in chemically
rGO on ammonia and toluene molecules was studied. We found that rGO
is highly activated by surface functionalities such as carboxyl, epoxy
functional groups, and π–π interaction for physical
and chemical adsorption for these gas molecules. It was revealed that
the reduction time of graphene oxide (GO) can be tuned to get better
response and complete recovery of the sensor. The response of the
sensor was carried out in the presence of ammonia/toluene, and nitrogen
(N2) was used as a carrier gas for room-temperature gas
sensing measurements. First-principles calculation of density functional
theory (DFT) was also executed to understand the role of oxygen functionalities
on rGO toward sensing mechanisms.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a–c
shows the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image
of rGO, which confirmed the graphene sheet morphology, and it was
observed to be crumpled. I–V characteristics of rGO for different reduction times of 10 min (RG1),
1 h (RG2), and 15 h (RG3) are shown in Figure 1d. The applied voltage ranged from −5
to +5 V. The linear I–V plot
confirms good ohmic contact between the sensing materials and Ag electrodes.
The resistance of rGO gradually decreases with increasing reduction
time from 10 min to 15 h (∼2.2 MΩ to 5.4 KΩ).

electrode.

To observe the variation in oxygen
functional groups, rGO was characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and
Raman measurement (Figure 2). From Figure 2a, it was revealed that upon oxidation of graphite flakes, the (002)
plane at 26.5° was shifted to (001) at 10.5° with complete
intercalation of oxygen functionalities.20 By the reduction of GO, the (001) plane shifted from 14.2°
to 24.1° for 10 min (RG1) and 24.19° for 15 h (RG3). It
was confirmed that in the case RG1, there was only a partial reduction
occurring during 10 min, and for RG3, the (002) plane resorted to
graphite nature at 15 h. It was observed that RG1 and RG3 have a diffraction
peak at 43.1°, which could be attributed to short-range ordering
in stacked graphene layers.21Figure 2b shows the FTIR
spectra of GO, RG1, and RG3. The band at 1565 cm–1 was assigned to C=C stretching of sp2 carbon atoms.
The shift in the C=C band was due to restoration of the π-network
because of the elimination of oxygen functional groups22,23 in the reduction process. The vibrations at 1413 and 1182–1022
cm–1 were assigned to deformation vibrations of
C–OH groups and C–O–C or ketones, respectively.20 The bands at 1724 cm–1 for
GO and 1632 cm–1 for RG1 and RG3 were attributed
to the asymmetric vibrations of carboxylic groups. The shift of C=O
revealed that with the reduction time, oxygen functional groups were
decreased.20,22,24 The increase in the reduction time of GO is clearly shown by the
decrease in the intensity of the band at 1632 cm–1 (−COOH) groups. The structural analysis of RG2 (1 h) was
discussed in Supporting Information Figure
S1.

Figure 2 (a) XRD, (b) FTIR, and (c) Raman spectra of RG1 and RG3. The graphite
and GO peaks were used as a reference. The bands/peaks are labeled.

From Raman spectra (Figure 2c), the ID/IG ratio of RG1 (1.05) and RG3
(1.07) has increased notably
with that of GO (1.02). This indicates that the reduction time altered
the structure of GO.20,25

The change in the electrical
response of sensing materials for
ammonia/toluene (300 ppm) under 35% relative humidity (% RH) is shown
in Figure 3. It was
observed that the resistance of the sensor increased while introducing
analytes. As anticipated, all five cycles have consistency for analyte
gases. From Figure 3a,b, RG1 having higher oxygen functionalities shows good response
for toluene (100 second—ON) than ammonia (very poor response)
and it did not completely recover to the initial resistance upon carrier
gas purge (100 second—ON). It could be suggested that the adsorbed
toluene molecules do not desorb completely during recovery process.
Because of this behavior of RG1, the response of the sensor decreases
upon consecutive ON and OFF cycles of vapor injection. Similarly,
for RG2, the recovery was poor upon each consecutive cycles (Figure 3a). This indicates
that the presence of functional groups might facilitate chemisorption
of ammonia molecules.26,27 Therefore, it shows poor recovery
under N2 purge. In RG3, after recovery, it retained its
base resistance on N2 purge (100 s). This suggested that
the removal of oxygen functional groups might facilitate for the complete
recovery of the analyte. The stability of the RG3 sensor was tested
with 10 consecutive cycles under 40% RH. The sensor shows the repeatability
and stability of both analytes (Figure S2a,b, respectively).

Figure 3 Electrical response of rGO-based sensors (RG1, RG2, and
RG3) as
a function of time for the detection of 300 ppm (a) ammonia and (b)
toluene for five consecutive cycles under 35% relative humidity.

The response of the sensor was
calculated using eqs 2 and 3. It
is one of the key parameters to describe the efficiency of sensing
materials to gas or vapor. For the RG3 sensor, the response toward
300 ppm of toluene was found to be 3.8% and, for ammonia, was 3.1%.
In this study, the response of the sensors (RG1, RG2, and RG3) was
tested for both the analytes, ammonia and toluene, in different RHs
(30–80%) and is presented in Figures S3 and S4. It was observed that there is
an influence of humidity to the response of the sensor for both the
analytes, ammonia and toluene. In the case of ammonia, the sensor
(RG2) shows poor recovery in the presence of humidity, whereas in
RG3, there is partial recovery. For toluene, it was observed that
with an increase in reduction, there is a complete recovery, which
further shows an increase with the increase in humidity. From this,
it was believed that humidity could influence the response and recovery
of the sensor.

Figure 4a shows
the RG3 sensor response to toluene at different concentrations (100–2800
ppm). It was observed that sensor response increased with an increase
in the analyte concentration. The calculated response of the sensor
was 2.9% at 100 ppm to 7.8% at 3000 ppm for toluene. The response
of the sensor devices varied linearly with the concentration (Figure 4b). The regression
coefficient values for ammonia and toluene were 0.9890 and 0.9932,
respectively.

concentrations
(100–2800 ppm) and (b) linear fit of sensor response vs ammonia/toluene
concentrations (100–1000 ppm).

Figure 5a
shows
the sensor response of RG3 toward 300 ppm of toluene and other VOCs.
Ammonia and toluene showed higher sensor response than other gases,
and corresponding response and recovery times are shown in Figure 5b. The calculated
response and recovery times for toluene were approximately 40 and
75 s, respectively. The sample was responded to all tested VOCs and
did not show specific selectivity. Further tuning of surface-active
sites of the sensor materials is to be done to improve the selectivity.

Figure 5 (a) Sensor
response of the RG3 sensor to different gases at room
temperature under 40% RH and (b) response and recovery times of the
RG3 sensor to 300 ppm test gases at room temperatures.

The response times of analyte molecules were 45
s for RG1 and 40
s for RG3, whereas the recovery times were 83 s for RG1 and 75 s for
RG3. It could be noted that RG1 has a baseline drift which could be
mainly attributed to the uncompleted desorption of analyte molecules.1 Upon repeated test cycles, more residual analyte
molecules existed in the sensor materials. It was not removed by the
carrier gas within 100 s to achieve an initial base resistance. It
could be suggested that excess of oxygen functional groups presence
on the surface of RG1 could cause good response toward the analyte,
but it was difficult to completely desorb within a fixed cycle period.
From FTIR spectra (Figure 2b), it was clear that the presence of carboxylic, epoxy, and
hydroxyl groups on the surface of rGO was gradually removed with the
increase in the reduction time (10 min to 15 h). The reduction by
hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) raises the reduction-based
defects, reorganization of sp2 carbon (π–π
interactions), and residual oxygen functional groups on the basal
plane. The optimized amount of these active sites could enhance the
sensor’s performance. In this case, it is suggested that more
physisorption takes place, enabling a faster recovery within 100 s
for RG3 than RG1. However, the response time was faster in the case
of RG1 with higher oxygen functional groups. The charge transfers
between analytes and rGO sensor were discussed in few reports.19,26 Understanding the role of oxygen functional groups on response and
favorable interaction sites is still an open challenge.

To understand
the interaction of the ammonia and toluene gas molecules
on the RG1 and RG3 sheets, DFT was used. The optimized molecular structure
of the two different kinds of rGO sheet (RG1(s) and RG3(s)) is shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively. In the rGO sheet, three unsaturated carbon
atoms are rearranged to form a nine-membered ring adjacent to a pentagon.
The epoxy group was preset at the dangling bond site and also in the
other possible sites along with −COOH and −OH functional
groups. Additionally, the hydrogen atoms were passivated in the remaining
unsaturated carbon edges. The optimized structures of toluene and
ammonia (monomer) gas molecules are presented in Figure 6c,d, respectively.

Figure 6 (a) Top view
of the optimized molecular structure of (a) RG1(s) and
(b) RG3(s). Optimized molecular structures
of (c) toluene and (d) ammonia molecules.

The gas molecules were adsorbed on the rGO sheet over a monovacancy
defect with parallel orientation of toluene and ammonia facing the
pentagon of the rGO sheet which is shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.
From the results, it was confirmed that the binding energy of toluene
(1.56 eV) was higher than that of ammonia (0.260 eV) with RG1(s) and this binding energy is found to decrease further for
both toluene (0.042 eV) and ammonia (0.040 eV) with RG3(s). The high binding energy of toluene was due to the electron-donating
ability of the methyl group attached to the benzene ring which induces
charge transfer from toluene to rGO, whereas the charge gain in ammonia
without the dissociation of N–H bond shows the charge transfer
from rGO to ammonia. The calculated nearest adsorption distance, adsorption
energy (Eads) of gas molecules on the
rGO surface, Mulliken charges (MC), and the energy gap Eg are tabulated in Table 1. Thus, from the above results, it was confirmed that
the ammonia gas molecule has less affinity than the toluene molecule
to the rGO sheets.

With the adsorption energy values, the recovery time
was calculated
using conventional transition-state theory, where the recovery time
τ was expressed as 1  where T is the temperature, KB is
Boltzmann’s constant, and and υ0 is the attempt
frequency. From this equation, it was found
that increasing the adsorption energy Eads will enhance the recovery time; the strong interaction makes the
desorption to be harder and implies longer recovery time. From the
results, the adsorption energies were short which illustrates the
short recovery time. Together with the experimental results, we can
conclude that the high number of oxygen atoms increases the adsorption
of toluene and ammonia. Further, the epoxy and hydroxyl groups on
the basal plane satisfy the dangling bond in the defect, giving rise
to lesser binding energy of ammonia.

From both experimental
and theoretical results, it was confirmed
that the binding energy of toluene/ammonia with RG1 is higher compared
to that of RG3. Because of this nature, RG1 shows poor desorption
than RG3 (Figure 3).
From this, it was suggested that the controlled reduction of oxygen
functional groups on rGO could increase the performance of the sensors.

3 Conclusions
The rGO-based sensing materials were fabricated
on a Ag electrode
by the drop-casting method. The difference in sensing response and
recovery of ammonia/toluene vapor at room temperature was studied.
The results revealed that higher oxygen functional groups functionalized
on the rGO surface yield higher sensor response and poor recovery,
whereas moderate sensing response with complete desorption was obtained
in less oxygen-functionalized rGO. It was believed that humidity could
influence the response of the sensor. It was revealed that controlled
reduction of GO shows good response for ammonia and toluene. Furthermore,
because of room-temperature operation, this kind of VOC sensors with
controlled oxygen functional groups on the surface of rGO could be
promising for environmental and industrial applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of rGO
rGO was prepared
from chemical reduction of GO using our previous reported procedure.28 In brief, hydrazine hydrate (1 mL) was added
into the dispersed GO solution. The solution was heated in an oil
bath at 100 °C with a water-cooled condenser for 10 min (RG1),
1 h (RG2), and 15 h (RG3); during this reaction time, reduced GO gradually
precipitated out as a black solid. The product was isolated by vacuum
filtration, washed copiously with water and methanol, and finally
dried at 60 °C.

4.2 Fabrication of a Sensor
The sensor
device was fabricated by drop-casting the rGO dispersion onto silver
electrodes. The Ag electrodes were fabricated using thermal evaporation
on a glass substrate. rGO (10 μL, 0.5 mg/1 mL) was drop-casted
on Ag electrodes and then dried at 60 °C. Further annealing was
carried out at 80 °C for 10 h in a hot air oven to remove excess
water molecules and improve contacts between rGO and Ag electrodes.
The sensor device was placed in a chamber with an electrical feedthrough.
A constant voltage of +0.5 V was applied to the device. The variation
in resistance was monitored and recorded with the changes in the atmospheric
environment (ammonia/toluene analytes and N2 gas) using
an Agilent B2902A source meter. The sensing measurement cycle is as
follows: first, N2 atmosphere (1000 sccm) was introduced
as the carrier gas, and then, an analyte gas (20–100 sccm)
was injected to record the sensing signal and again N2 gas
was introduced for sensor recovery. The change in resistance (ΔR) and the response of the sensor was calculated1 as given by eqs 2 and 3 2   3  where RN2 is the resistance of rGO in a N2 atmosphere
and Ranalyte is the resistance of rGO
in the presence
of ammonia/toluene vapor (ohms). Rb is
the base resistance of the sensing material in ohms. The relative
atmospheric humidity was 35%. The RH was adjusted from 30 to 80% to
measure the influence of humidity on the response of the sensor.

4.3 Computational Details
A rGO sheet
of approximately 19 benzene rings with the reconstructed monovacancy
defect and the functional groups such as −COOH, −OH,
and −C–O groups distributed on the basal, edges, and
at defects sites, respectively, was constructed. Further, rGO sheets
of high and low number of oxygen atoms were considered as C55H21O9 and C55H21O6 with C/O ratios of 13:1 and 6:1 in relation with the experimental
data and named RG1(s) (simulated rGO) and RG3(s), respectively. The interaction of ammonia and toluene gas molecules
on the surface of rGO was optimized using DFT. The B3LYP function
values of electronic properties are similar to the experimental values,29 as the 6-31G* basis function is commonly used
for physisorption in carbon nanomaterials30,31 and it suited well for the present work. The frequency calculations
were carried out for all optimized structures to confirm their minima
on the potential energy surface. All of the calculations were executed
using the Gaussian 0932 software package.
The adsorption energy of the gas molecules (ammonia—NH3 and toluene—C6H5–CH3) was calculated using eq 4 4  where ErGO+NH3, ENH3, and ErGO are
the total energies of the NH3 gas molecule-adsorbed rGO
complex, monomer NH3 gas molecule,
and the bare rGO sheet, respectively. Similar calculation is carried
out for the toluene gas molecule by replacing the energy of toluene
instead of ammonia.

4.4 Instruments and Characterizations
The XRD pattern of the as prepared rGO was investigated by a Bruker
ADVANCE D8 instrument. The morphology was examined by FESEM (FEI—QUANTA—FEG
250). Raman spectroscopy was performed on a Raman microscope (HORIBA
Jobin Yvon, HR800) with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm. The optical
analysis was performed with an optical microscope (Olympus BX51P).
The current–voltage characterization and sensing measurement
were performed using an Agilent B2902A source meter.
