The
novel “double strained alkyne” 3 has been
prepared and evaluated in strain-promoted azide-alkyne
cycloaddition reactions with azides. The X-ray crystallographic structure
of 3, which was prepared in one step from 1,1′-biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetrol 4, reveals the strained nature of the alkynes. Dialkyne 3 undergoes cycloaddition reactions with a number of azides,
giving mixtures of regiosiomeric products in excellent yields. The
monoaddition products were not observed or isolated from the reactions,
suggesting that the second cycloaddition proceeds at a faster rate
than the first, and this is supported by molecular modeling studies.
Dialkyne 3 was successfully employed for “peptide
stapling” of a p53-based diazido peptide, whereby two azides
are bridged to give a product with a stabilized conformation.

Introduction
Strained alkynes, i.e.,
alkynes distorted from the ideal linear
geometry, undergo cycloaddition reactions with azides without the
requirement for a copper catalyst (Scheme 1), in processes commonly referred to as strain-promoted
azide-alkyne cycloaddition or “click” reactions.1 As such, their reactions are clean and require
minimal processing during a workup. Moreover, due to their bioorthogonal
nature, strained alkynes have established themselves as valuable reagents
for bioconjugation reactions,2 for example,
the attachment of fluorescent groups to proteins to track the protein’s
movement during biological processes. Important examples of strained
alkynes that have become commercially available are shown in Figure 1.3

Figure 1 Well-established strained alkynes and dialkyne 1.

Scheme 1 Cycloaddition of a Strained Alkyne
with an Azide
Reagents that contain
two strained alkynes offer the potential
to link together two azide-containing functional groups or to bridge
two azides in a single molecule, which offers the potential, for example,
to stabilize the conformation of a flexible molecule such as a peptide.
A good example of this is the Sondheimer dialkyne 1,
which contains two highly strained alkynes bridged by aromatic rings.4,5 Although 1 was first reported in 1974, it was not applied
to a bioconjugation application until 2010 when Kii et al. employed
it to bridge between a protein-localized halotag-azide and a fluorescent
azide, resulting in successful fluorescent labeling of a protein.6 The reactions of 1 with diazo compounds
and furans have been reported, and the alkyne/alkene derivative has
been used in a cycloaddition with an azide.5 Dialkyne 1 has also been applied to the macrocyclization
of bis-azide functionalized peptides (“peptide stapling”)
by Spring et al.7 It has also been applied
to the control of the tetramerization of HIV-related peptides.8

In a recent research, we9a,9b and others9c reported the synthesis and
applications to azide
cycloadditions of the strained alkyne 2 and its derivatives,
which can be prepared in a short sequence from readily available starting
materials. We also demonstrated that its NHS-ester derivative could
be successfully attached to a protein and subsequently “clicked”
with an azide.9 Inspired by dialkyne 1 and its applications, we identified the corresponding biphenol-derived
dialkyne 3 for synthesis and investigation as a dual
click reagent (Figure 2).

Results and Discussion
The envisaged
strategy of synthesizing the target bis-strained
alkyne 3, a modification of the previously reported monoalkynes,9 required the prior synthesis of the previously
reported tetrahydroxy biphenyl precursor 4 (Scheme 2).10 1,3-Dimethoxybenzene was reacted with 1,3-dimethoxy-2-iodo-benzene
under Cu(I) catalysis in ethereal pyridine, giving 2,2′,6,6′-tetramethoxy-1,1′-biphenyl 5 in high yield (93%). The methyl-protecting groups were cleaved
using BBr3 in CH2Cl2 to obtain 1,1′-biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetrol 4 in multigram quantities (55%). The bis-macrocyclization
of the tetrol 4 was accomplished using ditosylate 6 in anhydrous MeCN using K2CO3 under
high-dilution conditions (ca. 14 mM) to furnish 3 in
reasonable yield (28%) for the challenging cyclization reaction.9a It was found that changing the concentration
or using a syringe pump to combine the reagents9c did not improve the yield.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Target
Bis-Strained Alkyne 3
Crystals of 3 were obtained, which were suitable
for
analysis by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 3; see the Supporting Information for full details). The solution confirmed the bis-strained
topology with a biphenyl (C5–C6–C7–C8) dihedral
angle of 69.8(3)° and an average sp bond angle of 165.3°.
The alkynyl moieties thus exhibit a similar degree of distortion compared
with the analogous monocyclic alkynes that have been studied in the
solid state (sp angles typically in the range of 163.0–167.7°),9 indicating that 1 would be expected
to have a similar reactivity.

alkyne 3 (ellipsoids plotted at the 50% probability level).

Cycloaddition Reactions
Following
the synthesis and
characterization of novel bis-strained alkyne 3, cycloaddition
reactions with RN3 (R = -CH2Ph, -octyl) were
undertaken to assess the efficacy of triazole formation (Scheme 3). The reactions
were conducted in CDCl3 (0.1 M, 298 K) and monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure 4 illustrates the spectra for the addition of octyl
azide to give 7; details of assignments are given in
the Supporting Information). Both cycloaddition
reactions were found to proceed with greater than 90% conversion to
the bis-addition products after 72 h (R = -CH2Ph; 93.2%,
-octyl; 95.6%), comparing favorably with previously reported monoalkynes
based on 2. This indicates that although bis-alkyne 3 displays a degree of alkyne sp bond strain, in the solid
state, similar to previously reported monoalkynes based on 2, it exhibits enhanced reactivity. Unexpectedly, the bis-clicked
products appeared to be formed directly, with only a transient observation
of what might be the intermediate monoclick product (resonance ca
δ 4.75 at ca. 6 and 24 h, Figure 4), suggesting that the first addition is the rate-determining
step. A similar observation was made in studies on dialkyne 1, speculated to be the result of increased steric hindrance
effects.6 Alternatively, an electronic
effect caused by the oxygen atoms in the ring of the initial addition
product could be influencing the reaction, making the level of strain
higher in the monocyclization adduct relative to that in 3 and hence the rate of the second cycloaddition step higher than
that of the first. Due to the nature of the double addition reaction,
it was not possible to accurately measure the rates of each step of
the cycloaddition; however, in terms of conversion over time, the
apparent rate constant is similar to that measured for the monocyclic
derivatives of 3, i.e., in the order of 10–4 M–1 s–1. Following chromatographic
purification, compounds 7 and 8 were isolated
in high yield (R = -CH2Ph; 89%, -octyl; 80%) as an inseparable
1:1 mix of syn- and anti-regioisomers
(Scheme 3). Although
inseparable, it was possible to assign the signals of many of the
protons in each regioisomer (see the Supporting Information).

cycloaddition of 3 with 2.0 equiv of octyl azide. The
doublet at ca. δ 4.75 may correspond to transient formation
of the monoadduct.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Bis-Triazoles 7 and 8
The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 in CDCl3 only indicated formation of the syn isomer
due
to the low solubility of anti-7. The
solubility of both isomers in (CD3)2SO confirms
the expected 1:1 mix of regioisomers. See the Supporting Information for full details. Single crystals of
compound anti-7 were obtained, which
were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, and the structure confirmed that
the compound preferentially crystallized exclusively as the anti-isomer but as a racemic mixture of enantiomers (Figure 5; see the Supporting Information for full detail). The
solution of 7 exhibits a significant diminution of biphenyl
torsion compared with the parent bis-alkyne 3 ([C5–C6–C7–C8]: 7; 60.6°, 3; 110.2° for the comparable
angle), reflecting the less strained topology granted by the formed
sp2 triazole.

Figure 5 Single-crystal X-ray structure of anti-7 (ellipsoids plotted at the 50% probability level,
H-atoms and solvate
omitted for clarity).

In addition, we investigated the cycloaddition reaction of
a PEG-1000
diazide with 3, with the potential for formation of an
addition polymer. Due to the large molecular mass of the PEG-1000,
this was carried out with higher dilution than for the small molecule
azides. However, a successful double-click reaction was observed,
and the product was characterized by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC), with full details given in the Supporting Information.

Computational Studies of the Cycloaddition
To understand
the kinetics of the cycloaddition more clearly, some molecular modeling
studies were carried out using Gaussian 0914 with the B3LYP
density functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set within the CPCM model
at standard conditions (see the Supporting Information for full computational details).11,6 The first cycloaddition,
leading to the formation of the monotriazole intermediate 9, was found to be the rate-determining step as the results indicated
that the second cycloaddition reaction, to both the syn and anti products, required a lower energy barrier
than the first by 0.8–1.0 kcal/mol (Figure 6; full details are given in the Supporting Information). These results mirror
the experimental observations and also those reported previously for
dialkyne 1, for which a specific steric interaction was
suggested to be responsible.6 It is likely
that a similar phenomenon is operating here, with the extra steric
demands of the newly generated triazole creating additional strain
energy at the remaining alkyne. This is supported by the molecular
modeling studies; the alkyne bond angle for the biphenyl diyne was
calculated to be 164.6° (which correlates well with the average
of 165.3° measured in the solid state), whereas the angles for
the monotriazole intermediate were 162.4 and 162.5°, respectively.

Peptide Stapling Studies
Given the promising results
described above, some investigations were carried out into the use
of 3 as a reagent for peptide stapling, a process in
which a flexible linear peptide can be “fixed” into
a much more stable conformation by linking two groups in the chain
(Figure 7).7,12 A (17–29)p53 peptide (Ac-ETFOrn(N3)DLWRLLOrn(N3)EN-NH2) was studied. Purified peptide and bis-alkyne 3 (1.1 equiv) were combined in tBuOH/H2O. The resulting solution ([peptide] = ca. 0.6
mM) was stirred at room temperature for 72 h. After 24 h at room temperature,
a small amount of stapling was observed by ESI-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).
The stapled peptide product (MW: 2075.28) coelutes with the LCMS peak
of the starting material (MW: 1756.95) (Supporting Information). We attempted the reaction over 24 h at rt followed
by 24 h at 37 °C, but the reaction did not reach completion.
At 48 h, another 1.5 equiv of linker was added, while maintaining
the reaction stirring at 37 °C. Maintaining the temperature at
37 °C gave better results; however, conversion to the stapled
peptide was incomplete and some starting material was still observed
after 72 h (full details are in the Supporting Information). These results indicate that although 3 is less reactive than dialkyne 1,6−8 it has the potential
to be used successfully as a “peptide stapling” reagent
and will react even at the low concentrations required for this type
of reaction. To confirm that both azides on the peptide had reacted,
IR spectra were recorded; the disappearance of the azide stretch at
2097 cm–1 was observed (Supporting Information). The increased reactivity of the second cycloaddition,
coupled to its intramolecular nature, is likely to be facilitating
the ring-closure process. It is likely that a mixture of syn- and anti-regioisomers was formed (see the Supporting information).

product has not been unambiguously established.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported the synthesis
of a novel bis-strained
alkyne compound 3 in three steps from readily available
commercial reagents. Dialkyne 3 was demonstrated to be
capable of cycloaddition reactions with azides in high conversion
(>90%) without the requirement for the use of a catalyst. The rate
of the cycloadditions with 3 was significantly lower
than with diyne 1, for which double cycloadditions are
reported to be complete within 1–4 h at rt6,7 (the
rate constant has been measured as (6.29 ± 0.05) × 10–2 M–1 s–1 in MeOH
at 25 °C).6 X-ray crystallographic
studies of 3 and anti-7 reveal the decrease in strain upon cycloaddition of azide, the main
driving force for the reaction. Computational studies supported the
experimental observation of a slower first cycloaddition, representing
the rate-determining step. The new bis-strained alkyne 3 has been used in preliminary stapling experiments, demonstrating
its potential applications to this application. Although again 3 is less reactive than diyne 1 in this application,
an excess of dialkyne 3 was required, with warming, whereas
an analogous peptide stapling reaction with 1.1 equiv of 1 was reported to be complete within 16 h at rt.7a However, reagent 3 also reacts without the
need for a copper catalyst and can therefore deliver clean products
without the requirement to remove metal residues, which is the principle
advantage of strained alkynes over unstrained ones. Furthermore, it
can be prepared in one synthetic step from a readily available starting
material. In situations where the highest reaction rates are not required,
this potentially makes it a synthetically valuable alternative to 1. Studies continue to define the scope of this reagent and
to isolate and study the properties of the stapled peptide.

Experimental
Section
Compounds 4 and 5 were
prepared as previously
described following the published methods and their spectra matched
those reported.10 General experimental
details, conversion/time graphs and related spectra, and GPC details
are given in the Supporting Information.

General Experimental Details
All solvents and reagents
were degassed before use and all reactions were carried out under
a nitrogen atmosphere. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
using aluminum-backed silica gel 60 (F254) plates, visualized using
UV 254 nm and phosphomolybdic acid or potassium permanganate dips
as appropriate. Flash column chromatography was carried out routinely
on silica gel. Reagents were used as received from commercial sources
unless otherwise stated. Copper(I) iodide was dried at 120 °C
for 18 h under dynamic vacuum and stored under N2, protected
from light. Dry solvents were purchased and used as received. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX (400 or 500 MHz)
spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in δ units, parts
per million relative to the singlet at 7.26 ppm for chloroform and
0.00 ppm for tetramethylsilane. Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Esquire2000 ESI or a Bruker MicroTOF mass spectrometer. Coupling constants
(J) are measured in hertz. IR spectra were recorded
on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One FT-IR Golden Gate. Melting points were
recorded on a Stuart Scientific SMP 1 instrument and are uncorrected.

Synthesis
of Bis-Alkyne 3
1,1′-Biphenyl-2,2′,6,6′-tetrol
(150 mg, 0.687
mmol) was added to but-2-ene ditosylate (568 mg, 1.44 mmol) and K2CO3 (474 mg, 3.43 mmol) in acetonitrile (50 mL,
ca. 14 mM), and the mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for
19 days. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, followed
by addition of H2O (30 mL), extraction with CH2Cl2 (3 × 30 mL), and drying (MgSO4). Removal
of the solvent under reduced pressure gave yellow oil, which was subsequently
purified by silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc/hexane 20:80 →
40:60) to afford a white solid. This crude solid was recrystallized
from hot EtOH, which was subsequently cooled to 4 °C, filtered,
and washed with ice cold EtOH to afford white X-ray diffraction quality
crystals of the title compound as a racemic mixture (60 mg, 0.18 mmol,
28%). Mp 222–230 °C (dec); (found (ESI): [M + Na]+, 341.0786. C20H14O4+ requires [M + Na]+, 341.0784); νmax 2938, 2885, 1549, 1061 and 831 cm–1; δH (500 MHz, CDCl3) 7.43 (2H, t, J 8.1, ArH), 7.03 (4H, d, J 8.1, ArH), 4.58–4.46

Synthesis
of Bis-Benzyl Triazole 7
A solution of 3 (15.9 mg, 0.05 mmol) and benzyl azide
(13.3 mg, 0.10 mmol) in CDCl3 (0.5 mL, 100 mM) was prepared
with a J. Young’s NMR tube. In situ analysis by NMR spectroscopy
indicated formation of the desired bis-triazole compounds within 72
h at ambient temperature. After 5 days, the solvent was removed in
vacuo and purified by column chromatography (SiO2; EtOAc/hexane;
20:80 → 50:50) to obtain a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers as a
white solid (26 mg, 0.044 mmol, 89%). Note: Due to the insolubility
of anti-regioisomer in CDCl3 (this crystallizes
from solution and the provided material for the X-ray crystal structure
given below), the NMR data is given only for the syn isomer. However, both syn- and anti-isomers are soluble and observable in (CD3)2SO.

Polyoxyethylene Diazide (MW = 2000) Addition
A solution
of 1 (5.0 mg, 15.7 μmol) and PEG-2000 polyoxyethylene
diazide (MW = 2000) (31.4 mg, 15.7 μmol) in CDCl3 (0.5 mL, 0.33 mM) was prepared with a J. Young’s NMR tube.
In situ analysis by NMR spectroscopy indicated formation of a polymeric
species. The conversion after 7 days was determined to be 86% by integration
of the starting material versus the polymeric product. GPC analysis
indicated the formation of a product of Mn 13 000, Mw 186 000, and
PDi 14.25.
