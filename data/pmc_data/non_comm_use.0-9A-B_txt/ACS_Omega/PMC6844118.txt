The development of
fully natural wheat gluten foams showing rapid
and high uptake of water, sheep blood, and saline solution, while
maintaining high mechanical stability in the swollen state, is presented.
Genipin was added as a natural and polar cross-linker to increase
the polarity of the protein chains, whereas cellulose nanofibers (CNFs)
were added as a reinforcement/stiffener of the foams, alone or in
combination with the genipin. The presence of only genipin resulted
in a foam that absorbed up to 25 g of water per gram of foam and a
more than 15 g uptake in only 8 min. In contrast, with CNF alone,
it was not possible to maintain the mechanical stability of the foam
during the water uptake and the protein foam disintegrated. The combination
of CNF and genipin yielded a material with the best mechanical stability
of the tested samples. In the latter case, the foam could be compressed
repeatedly more than 80% without displaying any structural damage.
The results revealed that a strong network had formed between the
wheat gluten matrix, genipin, and cellulose in the foam structure.
A unique feature of the absorbent/foam, in contrast to commercial
superabsorbents, was that it was able to rapidly absorb nonpolar liquids
(here, n-heptane) due to the open-cell structure.
The capillary-driven absorption due to the open-cell structure, the
high liquid absorption in the cell walls, and the mechanical properties
(both in dry and swollen states) of these natural foams make them
interesting as a sustainable replacement for a range of petroleum-based
foam materials, including absorbent hygiene products such as sanitary
pads.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Wheat gluten (WG) protein is obtained as an industrial product
stream that stands out among proteins due to its high molecular weight
and unique ability to form stable cross-linked networks, even in its
plasticized state.1−5 WG has been extensively evaluated for its properties, showing its
potential as an interesting natural-based viscoelastic material that
is possible to be processed with traditional plastic-processing techniques,
e.g., extrusion and injection/compression molding.6−13 Its high cohesion/melt strength also makes WG suitable for expansion
into stable foams.13−15 We have in previous works shown that stiff or soft
(glycerol-plasticized) WG foams absorb large amounts of polar liquids
and are suitable as sponges/absorbent materials.15,16 Besides capillary-driven uptake, these foams also absorb a high
volume of water in the cell walls, leading to an uptake of more than
30 times its initial weight, providing superabsorbent properties.15,17 The capillary action of the open cells in freeze-dried WG foams
also led to a rapid and relatively high uptake of nonpolar liquids.15 The mechanical stability/integrity of the dry
and swollen WG-based foam can be improved by the use of compounds
that cross-link the protein network, in addition to what is achieved
by internal disulfide cross-links in the protein itself. The most
commonly used cross-link agents for proteins are dialdehydes such
as glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, and formaldehyde.18−21 These are, however, toxic unless
fully reacted in the protein network, and they are typically not biobased.
This is unfortunate since the development of a formulation based on
solely nontoxic elements would facilitate the development of WG as
a fully sustainable and safe material.

Thermally insulating
and flame-retardant WG foams have previously
been made with the addition of in situ polymerized silica.13 Conductive WG foams have been obtained using
carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanosized carbon black.14 In addition, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs, ∼1 wt %),22 cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs, 10 wt %)23 and CNTs (>10 wt %)14 were demonstrated to increase the stiffness of the WG material by
a factor of up to 10. The CNFs and CNCs are interesting as fillers
since they provide reinforcement for a fully biobased and biodegradable
material.24−29 Also, CNF and CNC hydrogels with high swelling capacity have been
previously reported, demonstrating the capability of these materials
to function as fillers in absorbent biobased materials.30−32 Hence, it has been demonstrated that WG as a raw material has the
potential to produce materials with tunable properties, which are
sufficient to compete with fossil-oil-based plastics, e.g., absorbent
products.33 Life-cycle analysis of protein-based
plastics (WG) was previously compared to four common oil-based plastics,
polypropylene, high- and low-density polyethylene, and polyamide 6,6,
demonstrating a reduction of greenhouse gases, when using WG, in the
range of 1–8 kg gas per kg material.34

The development of highly liquid-absorbing, fully natural
WG foams
with mechanical stability in the swollen state is presented here.
The liquids tested for absorption were water, 0.9 wt % NaCl aqueous
salt solution, and defibrinated sheep blood, which are important in
the context of evaluating absorbent hygiene products. Genipin (GEN),
a naturally occurring and harmless cross-linker extracted from the
fruit of the Gardenia jasminoidesEllis plant,35−37 was used as an alternative to dialdehyde cross-linkers.
In addition, cellulose nanofibers were added to stiffen/reinforce
the foam. Surprisingly, the addition of CNF alone led to foams that
disintegrated in the liquids while showing the highest compression
modulus in the dry state. On the other hand, the combination of CNF
and genipin yielded a foam with high mechanical stability in the swollen
state, resembling commercial foams encountered in daily-care products.
Because of its open-cell structure and contributions from capillary
actions, the foam could also rapidly and readily absorb nonpolar n-heptane.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Foam Morphology
Figure 1 shows the surfaces of the
cryofractured dry foams. The porous structure of the WG reference
foam was similar to that of foams investigated previously, consisting
mainly of open cells (Figure 1a).13−15,22 As shown in Table 1 and in the upper
images in Figure 1,
the cells were larger in the WG reference foam than in the other three
foams containing cellulose nanofibers, genipin, or a mixture of these,
where the cells showed relatively similar size. The density was also
the highest and the porosity consequently the lowest in the WG foam
(Table 1). The porosity
range of the four foams was 86–90%. As shown in Figure 1, the cell walls often had
holes (least frequent in WG and WG/CNF and most frequent in WG/CNF/GEN).
They were located close to the cell wall edges, as in the WG/GEN sample
(Figure 1c) or close
to the middle of the cell walls, as in the WG/CNF/GEN sample (Figure 1d). Note the fibrillar
strands that bridge the holes in the samples containing genipin (Figure 1c,d). These features
are a consequence of the consistency of the dispersion and its effect
on the formation of ice and cells in the freeze-drying process. The
dispersion apparent viscosity observed during mixing was the lowest
for WG and WG/CNF and increased significantly when genipin was added,
especially in the presence of cellulose nanofibers. The homogenized
foam (air/liquid dispersion mixture) was stable for more than an hour
in the presence of genipin, but without genipin, the foamed suspension
collapsed during cooling from 90 °C. No clear border separating
the foam above the liquid part and the liquid existed when genipin
was used.

The WG/GEN dispersion changed color during the stirring from yellow/light
brown to green, indicating a reaction between genipin and amino acids/protein
in the presence of oxygen.38 This, together
with the observed increase in viscosity and stability of the foam
dispersion, indicated that genipin formed cross-links and/or bulky
polar side groups grafted onto the protein chain. Since the dispersion
viscosity was the highest and the color change greatest among the
other samples in the presence of both genipin and CNF, a strong molecular
network seemed to form between the WG, genipin, and CNF. To verify
that there was a reaction not only between WG and genipin but also
between genipin and CNF, the latter two were mixed together following
the protocol for making WG/CNF/GEN but without WG. The change in color
to green of the whitish CNF dispersion when the white genipin powder
was added indicated a reaction between genipin and CNF (Figure S1, Supporting Information). When the
supernatant was removed by centrifugation, it was seen that the CNF
pellet had changed color from white to light yellow/brown (Figure S1d). In addition, a comparison of the
IR spectra of neat CNF and CNF reacted with genipin indicated that
the −OH concentration was lower in the latter. This, together
with the absence of the intrinsic genipin carbonyl band in this sample
indicated that a reaction had occurred between CNF and GEN (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

2.2 Liquid Absorption in the Foams
The
materials swollen in water and saline solution using the tea-bag method
became gels, as illustrated for water in Figure 2. The exception was the WG/CNF foam, which
rapidly disintegrated into a slurry without any mechanical integrity.
As shown in Figure 3, the uptake of water and saline solution was the lowest in this
sample. The presence of cellulose nanofibers alone apparently reduced
the cohesion of the protein material in the wet state. However, together
with genipin, the foam containing CNF showed high cohesion properties
(Figure 2d) with a
high mechanical stability in the swollen state, leading to a lower
liquid uptake than that of WG/GEN (Figure 3). The highest apparent uptake of water after
16 h swelling was observed for WG and WG/GEN, with, respectively,
18 and 25 g of water per gram of dry foam, corresponding to weight
increases of, respectively, ca. 2000 and 2900% (Figure 3a).

method.

The saline absorption in the WG
and WG/GEN foams was reduced by
72 and 63%, respectively, compared to their maximum uptake in water.
This decrease in the uptake of saline solution was due to the combined
decrease in osmotic pressure and charge repulsion effects when the
liquid contained mobile ions.39,40 The difference in uptake
between water and saline solution was smaller for WG/CNF/GEN and WG/CNF
(Figure 3), and the
saline absorption in the WG, WG/GEN, and WG/CNF/GEN foams was in the
range that made them interesting as fully biobased alternatives in
absorbent hygiene products.17,33 The blood swelling
tests revealed that the WG/CNF/GEN material was able to swell ca.
7 g/g of blood within the first 10 min, corresponding to 50% of the
blood swelling obtained for foams taken from a commercial sanitary
pad. The lower absorption of the protein foam compared to the commercial
foam is likely due the pore sizes observed for the latter, which were
overall 10 times smaller than those of the WG/CNF/GEN material (Figure S3, Supporting Information). However,
the protein-based material revealed the ability to behave in a manner
similar to that of the commercial sanitary foam, i.e., it was possible
to repeatedly squeeze the blood out of the material and reabsorb the
fluid within seconds (Video S1, Supporting
Information).

The effects of capillary action were evaluated
by a rapid absorption
test in a solvent that is not absorbed into the foam cell walls.15,16Table 2 shows that
the 1 s absorption of n-heptane was by far the highest
in WG/GEN/CNF. This can be explained by the numerous holes in the
cell walls, giving this sample a greater porosity than the other foams
(Figure 1d). If all
of the cells are completely filled with n-heptane
(Qnh), the uptake can
be calculated from the known density of n-heptane
(ρnh = 684 kg/m3)41 and solid WG (ρWG, 1300 kg/m3) and the foam porosity (vc, Table 1), using eq 1 1  Table 2 shows that,
in contrast to the other foams, almost all of
the cells were filled in the WG/GEN/CNF foam during the 1 s immersion.
This material also showed the highest 1 s water uptake, although the
differences were smaller between the samples than in the case of n-heptane.

WG/CNF	2.6	2.3	3.8	
WG/GEN	2.4	2.3	4.2	
WG/GEN/CNF	4.2	2.4	4.5	
a Dry foam is in this case a foam
equilibrated at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity (RH).

The short-term uptake of water in
a commercial superabsorbent material
was also determined for comparison. It is noteworthy that, with a
1 s value of ca. 1.5 g/g, its short-term uptake was lower than that
of all of the WG foams (Table 2).

The Voigt equation (eq 3) was fitted to the water uptake
data for the first 1600 s (27 min),
which included the rapid initial uptake within the first 1 min and
the following levelling off (Figure 3a). Hence, the further sizable uptake of water in longer
times, which was large for WG and WG/GEN, was not included. The very
high rapid uptake in the WG/GEN foam resulted in the shortest characteristic
swelling time (τ = 44 s) and the highest pre-exponential factor
(Qo = 17 g/g) (Table 3). The longest τ was observed for WG
(506 s), explained by this having the highest density, whose τ
was in the same range as that reported earlier for water in cottonseed
protein grafted with a synthetic acrylic acid monomer, but it was
not as small as in the present WG/GEN foam.42,43 Although the R2 value for this sample
was lower for the saline uptake than for water, the most rapid and
high uptake of saline was observed for WG/GEN (τ = 51 s and Qo = 9.1 g/g, Table 3). This foam became a large gel within the
first minute, which is explained by the high polarity of genipin remaining
in the reacted/cross-linked state. The highly alkaline conditions
used for the foam preparation could also induce hydrolysis of the
methyl ester group present in the genipin molecule, inducing the formation
of neutralized carboxylic acid groups that provide higher electrostatic
repulsion and explain the rapid water swelling hereby obtained.33,44,45 A small τ and high Qo were also observed for the WG/CNF/GEN, which
shows the importance of having genipin in the formulation if a fast
and high uptake of both water and saline is desired.

Beyond
ca. 28 min, the additional water uptake was small for WG/CNF
and WG/CNF/GEN (Figure 3a). The WG foam showed, on the other hand, a greater increase in
uptake of both water and saline between 28 min and 24 h. The situation
for WG/GEN was more complex. In water, a similar uptake pattern as
with WG was observed, except that a decrease in weight was observed
toward the swelling time above 16 h. In saline, the weight of the
WG/GEN foam decreased already beyond 8 min of swelling. The decrease
in weight, coupled with the blue coloring of the water and saline
during the later stages of swelling (above ca. 16 h), indicated that
genipin reacted to a certain degree with water/saline-soluble peptides/amino
acids, which were slowly leached from the foam to the solution. Genipin
was considered to be grafted onto the protein chains without always
forming a cross-link. With all of the genipin-containing foams, the
liquid turned slightly blue and the actual weight change pattern at
longer times depended on whether uptake or loss dominated. It should
be emphasized that the long-term swelling behavior is irrelevant for
several absorbent applications, especially those related to hygiene
products.

The capillary-driven uptake was not the only absorption
mechanism
since the maximum swelling was greater than the expected uptake if
only the pores were filled with liquid and no uptake occurred in the
cell wall material (Tables 2 and 3).15 The swelling in saline also indicated that the expansion of the
foams was affected by absorption in the cell walls since it was 50%
lower than when pure water was used, i.e., the cell wall expansion
was limited due to the presence of salt ions.31,33,46

The uptake in the cell wall was revealed
by a second freeze-drying
of the swollen foam, which is also a way of obtaining a higher-porosity
bimodal cell size system.15 This was done
on foams that had been subjected to 24 h swelling in water and contained
in the tea bags. The swollen materials were frozen in liquid nitrogen
while contained in the tea bag prior to the surface analysis. The
cryofractured surfaces of these revealed numerous small cells (≤10
μm) inside the cell wall, which was a consequence of ice formation
and subsequent sublimation (Figure 4). The structure of the freeze-dried WG/CNF water-swollen
foam was very different from that of the other foams (lower-magnification
images in Figure 4b
with Figure 4a,c,d).
The cells developed during the first freeze-drying collapsed during
subsequent swelling in water, probably due to the poor cohesion and
mechanical stability of this foam. The saline-swollen foam structures
were similar to those of the water-swollen foams (see WG foam in Figure 5), but with the second
freeze-drying, it was also possible to see that salt ions had entered
the cell walls since salt crystals were observed embedded within the
cell wall (Figure 5 inset). Nonetheless, the absence of a secondary porous structure
in the foams taken from a commercial sanitary pad and swollen in the
exact same way as the WG foams suggested that the majority of the
swelling in the former material is solely due to capillary-driven
actions (Figure S3b, Supporting Information).
This represents an advantage over commercial non-bio-based foams since
the swelling is due to both capillary-driven absorption and cell wall
expansion.

2.3 Mechanical Properties
The modulus
of the dry WG foam was 13 MPa, which was higher than previously reported
values due to the higher density of the present WG foam.13−15 The cellulose nanofibers (1 wt %) resulted in an increase in the
modulus of the WG foam by ca. 85% (WG/CNF, Table 4). In addition, the compression modulus of
WG/CNF was at least twice as high as that previously reported for
reinforced WG-based foams with the same densities as the materials
developed here.13−15 The strength (σs/σ10) was, however, only slightly improved by adding CNF since this foam
(WG/CNF) was more brittle than the other foams and fragmented completely
during the deformation (Figure 6a) long before 80% strain was reached. An additional reason
for the only slight improvement in strength was that its density was
lower than that of the pure WG foam. The addition of genipin (WG/GEN)
did not increase the stiffness, but it improved the strength of the
foam. The density was, however, lower than those of both the WG and
WG/CNF foams. The combination of CNF and genipin (WG/CNF/GEN) yielded
a foam with an only marginally higher stiffness than that without
CNF (WG/GEN), and it had the lowest yield/σ10 strength
of all of the foams studied (Table 4). This is explained by the fact that WG/CNF/GEN had
the lowest density of the tested materials (Table 1). The stress at the maximum strain (80%)
increased with increasing initial density (WG/CNF/GEN < WG/GEN
< WG) (Figure 6a).

The stiffness and strength of the wet foams were considerably lower
(3–4 orders of magnitude) than those of the dry foams, showing
the effect of water as a plasticizing agent (Table 4). Since the addition of CNF (WG/CNF) resulted
in a foam that fragmented in water, mechanical testing could not be
performed. It should be noted that the foams containing genipin were
very soft and, in the case of WG/CNF/GEN, retained their shape with
no apparent plastic deformation or partial fracture after exposure
to a high compressive strain (Figure 6b). The swollen WG/CNF/GEN foam recovered ca. 75% of
its original size/shape during the first 20 s after repeated high
compression and release (Video S2, Supporting
Information). The recovery was smaller for the wet WG/GEN and wet
WG foams, where significant damage occurred before the maximum strain
was reached. To conclude, the combination of genipin and cellulose
nanofibers yielded a natural-based foam with remarkably high gel strength.

2.4 Molecular Structure
The IR spectra
of the samples are shown in Figure 7. The carbonyl peak at 1730–1750 cm–1 was higher for WG/GEN than for the other foams, a consequence of
the ester group in the genipin molecule. In addition, the increase
in the peak intensity at 1720 cm–1 and 1440–1320
cm–1 for WG/GEN (and also, but to a lesser extent,
for WG/GEN/CNF) suggests the formation of carboxylic acid (−COOH/–COO–) functional groups.47,48 This group
formation could be a consequence of the hydrolysis of the methyl ester
group in the genipin molecule due to the alkali conditions used for
the foam preparation, also explaining the high/rapid swelling obtained
for the WG/GEN specimen.44,45 The deconvolution of
the nine peaks in the amide I region is shown in Figure 7 and Table 5. The peak positions were fixed and were
the same as in previous publications.49−52 When the R2 value for the fitting reached 0.9992 or higher, the peaks
were allowed to move a maximum of ±1 cm–1 from
their initial position, and the fitting iteration process continued
until an R2 value above 0.9995 was obtained.
This was possible for all samples except WG/GEN. Overall, the variation
in the content of the different secondary structures was relatively
small (Table 5). The
content of strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets was the highest
for WG/CNF and the lowest for WG/GEN, indicating that the CNF promoted
more protein aggregation than genipin. Less aggregated proteins should
show a higher content of α-helices and unordered chains,9,12,52,53 which is in line with the higher values for the genipin-containing
samples. It appears that the grafting and cross-linking using genipin
resulted in a more constrained molecular structure, reducing the degree
of aggregation compared to the other foams. Both CNF and genipin,
at least in its unreacted form, absorb infrared radiation in the amide
I region at 1630 cm–1 (CNF)54 and 1680/1621 cm–1 (unreacted genipin). However,
the changes in the amide I spectra [Figure 7 (middle)] when the two additives were present
could not be explained by the presence of their individual peaks,
probably due to the small content of the two, even though changes
in the carbonyl peak (Figure 7, left, inset) were readily observed for WG/GEN. This IR peak
is, however, very sensitive to carbonyl content. Hence, the deconvolution
and peak fitting were made, ignoring any contribution from CNF and
genipin.

The extraction buffer
and procedure used for the size-exclusion
high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) analysis are known
to extract 100% of the proteins that are present in the raw WG powder
and also in WG foams prepared by denaturing the protein in a pH 11
aqueous dispersion heated to 75 °C.13,22 However, denaturing the protein at 90 °C, as performed here,
increases the degree of cross-linking/polymerization of the protein.
The total extraction was ca. 70% of that of the foams previously made
at 75 °C.13 The WG/CNF, WG/GEN, and
WG/CNF/GEN foams had a total relative extraction of 110–150%
compared to the WG foam (Figure 8a), which is the result of changes in the protein structure
(protein chain folding and/or changes in the protein chemical structure)
leading to different light absorption/reflectance patterns, which
affect the HPLC detector signal and the HPLC output data, as previously
observed.22,55 It is, nevertheless, possible to detect
certain trends in the extraction data. Proteins were generally more
easily extractable from the WG/CNF foam than from the other foams
(more from Ext 1 and 2 than from Ext 3), whereas the IR spectrum indicated
a more ordered structure. Thus, the addition of CNF seemed to contribute
with a greater number of β-sheet aggregates but of relatively
smaller sizes, making them readily extractable. Both GEN and CNF,
alone or in combination, led to an increase in the polymer-to-monomer
ratio of the extracted protein, indicating an increase in the overall
protein polymer size compared to that of the WG foam (Figure 8b).

of proteins using the three-step SE-HPLC
method. The total extractable proteins were normalized to WG assuming
a total protein extraction of 70%.

The amount of genipin grafted onto the protein chains depends not
only on the amount of genipin added (only 1 wt % here) but also on
the groups available for reaction, which are mainly the amine groups
of the lysine residue. In addition, for a covalent cross-link to be
formed, two grafted lysine residues each with a genipin molecule have
to meet.36,56 WG has a relatively low lysine content compared
to proteins where a high degree of genipin cross-linking has been
observed, e.g., soy protein.35,57,58 Nevertheless, the low content of genipin used here led to a suitable
mix of grafted and cross-linked polar molecules, which provided rapid
liquid uptake and a foam with high mechanical stability in the swollen
state, especially where CNF was also present. Future work should concern
the optimization of the genipin content relative to the protein reactive
sites to further tailor the properties of these biofoams toward promising
substitutes for several applications nowadays dominated by petroleum-based
absorbent/porous materials.

3 Conclusions
A fully natural and biobased foam of wheat gluten, containing genipin
and cellulose nanofibrils, was demonstrated as a porous material with
superabsorbent (up to 25 times its initial weight in water) and rapid
swelling properties. The porous WG/CNF/GEN material absorbed ca. 10
times its own weight in both water and saline, and about 7 g/g of
blood, while maintaining a high mechanical integrity, which was in
contrast to the behavior when CNF was used alone as a foam filler.
The wet foam could be repeatedly compressed to a high strain value
(80%), showing essentially no damage to the foam after compression.
A suggested structure involving WG and genipin giving rise to the
specific properties of the foam, with and without CNF, is shown in Figure 9. A unique property
of the present absorbent/foam compared to that of commercial superabsorbents
is that, besides the high absorption of polar liquids, it also rapidly
absorbed the nonpolar n-heptane as a result of the
capillary forces associated with the open-cell structure.

Figure 9 Suggested reactions
of the (a) WG/GEN and (b) WG/CNF/GEN systems.
The average size of the CNF used was approximately 2–3 μm
in length and 10 nm in diameter.

It was also demonstrated that the mechanical properties and absorption/swelling
behavior of foams could be tuned by the addition of solely natural
additives: a polar cross-linker (genipin) and cellulose nanofibers.
The results pave the way for future uses of protein superabsorbents
in a range of products including hygiene applications where foams
are used, e.g., sanitary pads.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Wheat gluten (WG) powder
with a protein content of 77.7 wt % (modified NMKL N6, Kjeltec, Nx5.7)
was provided by Lantmännen Reppe AB, Sweden. The total starch
content in the WG was 5.8 wt %, as determined by the Ewers polarimetric
method (ISO 10520:1997). The lipid content was 1.2 wt % (Soxtec, Lidfett.OA.19,
Tecator AN 301). Genipin (>98% HPLC Grade) was purchased from Zhixin
Biotechnology, China. The cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were purchased
as a commercial type of Nata de Coco before their extraction (see Section 4.2.3).

4.2 Foam Preparation
4.2.1 WG Foam Preparation
The WG foams
were prepared as previously described by Wu et al.13−15 Briefly, 20
g of WG powder was poured into a beaker containing 100 mL of Milli-Q
water under magnetic stirring. The dispersion was adjusted to pH 11
by adding 1 M NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich, Puriss, p.a. ACS >98%). The
dispersion
was stirred until the pH became stable at 11, which took ca. 10 min.
Thereafter, additional Milli-Q water was added until a volume of 120
mL was reached. To achieve protein denaturation and intermolecular
disulfide cross-linking, the WG dispersion was heated in a silicone
oil bath to 90 °C. While being heated, the wheat gluten dispersion
was homogenized and foamed at 9500 rpm, using an IKA Yellow Line Di
25 homogenizer equipped with an S25N-18G dispersion tool. After reaching
90 °C and a volume increase of ca. 300%, the mixture was removed
from the bath and cooled to room temperature at ambient conditions
and thereafter poured into cuboid silicone molds [10 × 10 × 11 mm]. The filled molds were then
stored at −25
°C for 12 h and subsequently freeze-dried for 48 h. This sample
is referred to as the WG foam.

4.2.2 WG/GEN
Preparation
The WG/Genipin
foam was prepared by the same procedure as the pure WG, but when the
cooling WG dispersion reached 40 °C, 200 mg of genipin powder
was slowly added to give a final foam with 1 wt % genipin. The dispersion
was then stirred for another 2 h at 40 °C, whereupon the mixture
gradually turned green in color. It was then frozen and freeze-dried
in the same way as the WG foam. This is referred to as the WG/GEN
foam.

4.2.3 WG/CNF and WG/CNF/GEN Preparation
The cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were extracted from bacterial cellulose
cubes as described by Liu et al.59 The
CNF had a specific surface area of 160 m2/g, an average
length of 2–3 μm, and a diameter below 10 nm. The extracted
CNF was available as a 0.4 wt % aqueous dispersion (neutral pH). To
prepare the foam containing 1 wt % cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), 20
g of WG was added to an aqueous dispersion containing 200 mg of CNF.
The foam was then prepared in the same way as with WG alone. This
foam is referred to as WG/CNF. In the foam that contained 1 wt % CNF
and 1 wt % genipin, the preparation was the same as with WG/CNF, except
that, when the material had cooled to 40 °C, 200 mg of genipin
powder was added. As with the WG/GEN, the mixture was stirred for
another 2 h before it was freeze-dried. This foam is referred to as
WG/CNF/GEN.

4.3 Density Determination
The density
was calculated from the mass and volume of five foam specimens. The
porosity was calculated assuming a WG solid density of 1300 kg/m3.9

4.4 Short
Immersion in Water and n-Heptane
The foam
was immersed in Milli-Q water or n-heptane (97%)
for 1 s and then weighed on an analytical
balance. Loosely attached water/n-heptane on the
surface of the foam was removed before weighing by touching a corner
of the cuboid foam with a tissue paper.

4.5 Water
and Liquid Swelling Measurement
The absorption of water,
saline solution (0.9 wt % NaCl), and defibrinated
sheep blood in the foams was assessed using the “Tea-bag method”
described in the EDANA NWSP 240.0.R2 standard. The defibrinated sheep
blood herein used was provided by the Disease Vector Group, Department
of Plant Protection Biology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,
Alnarp, Sweden. For the swelling test, bags were produced from two
40 × 60 mm2 sheets of a 408-mesh nylon fabric. The
bags were heat-sealed along three edges and stored in a desiccator
with silica gel for at least 3 days before use. For the absorption
test, a cuboid foam sample, which had been dried in a desiccator with
silica gel for at least 30 days, was placed inside the bag, which
was then heat-sealed along the fourth edge. The nylon bag containing
the foam was first weighed and then placed in the liquid for different
time periods. When the bag was removed from the liquid, it was allowed
to hang for 10 s and then placed onto a piece of tissue paper for
5 s to remove the excess liquid before being weighed again. The liquid
absorption was calculated as 2  where Wi is the
weight of the wet sample and bag, We the
weight of the dry bag, kblank the correction
factor for absorption of liquid in the bag material itself, and Wd the weight of the dry sample. 3  The Voigt equation (eq 3) was fitted to the short-term
liquid uptake
data, following the procedure of Zhang et al.42 In eq 3, Q (g liquid/g dry foam) is the absorption at time t (s), Qo is the final absorption (30
min value), and τ (s) is a “characteristic” swelling
time.

4.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The sample morphology was investigated using a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission
scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The specimens were frozen in
liquid nitrogen for ca. 5 min and then fractured into small pieces.
The SEM images of the swollen materials were obtained from frozen
fragments rescued from the nylon bags. These specimens were fixed
onto FE-SEM sample holders using a conductive carbon paste. The samples
were coated with palladium/platinum in an Agar high-resolution sputter
coater (model 208RH) for 30 s. The average cell diameter of each foam
was obtained from 50 measurements in SEM micrographs. The cell size
diameter was taken as the largest distance between two opposite cell
walls.

4.7 Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy
The samples
were dried in a desiccator with silica gel for 1 week before the IR
measurements. The IR spectroscopy data were obtained with a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 100 instrument, equipped with a Golden Gate unit (Single-reflection
ATR, Graseby Specac Ltd.) and a triglycine sulfate detector. The scanning
step was 1.0 cm–1 with a resolution of 4.0 cm–1. The spectrum was based on 16 consecutive scans between
4000 and 600 cm–1. The peak deconvolution in the
amide I region was performed as reported by Cho et al.9 using the PerkinElmer Spectrum software [version 10.5.1
(2015)] with an enhancement factor (γ) of 2 and a smoothing
filter of 70%. The subsequent Gaussian peak curve fitting was performed
in Origin and MATLAB.

4.8 Size-Exclusion High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography
(SE-HPLC)
The protein solubility and relative molecular size
were evaluated by means of size-exclusion high-performance liquid
chromatography (SE-HPLC) in a Waters 2690 Separations Module and a
Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector (Waters). The three-step extraction
procedure implemented here was the same as that reported by Gällstedt
et al.60 Briefly, a solution of 0.5 wt
%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 0.05 M NaH2PO4 (pH 6.9) was used as a buffer in combination with multiple ultrasonication
steps. For the tests, all of the foams were ground using a mortar.
The first extraction (Ext. 1) was obtained from the supernatant (SN)
of a centrifuged dispersion after 5 min of shaking at 2000 rpm (16.000
RCF of 16 mg of the powders in 1.4 mL buffer). In the second extraction
(Ext. 2), the pellet from Ext. 1 was resuspended in 1.4 mL of SDS–phosphate
solution followed by 30 s ultrasonication and centrifugation for obtaining
the SN. The third extraction (Ext. 3) consisted of the SN obtained
from centrifuging the pellet from Ext. 2 after dispersing the pellet
with fresh SDS–phosphate solution and applying repeated ultrasonication
intervals (30 + 60 + 60 s). Three replicates were used. The total
protein extractability from the three extraction steps of a ground
pure WG foam treated at 90 °C was used as a reference. The amount
of protein extracted from the other foams was normalized with respect
to that of the WG foam (total extraction from the three extraction
steps) and assuming a total protein extraction of 70% as obtained
in previous work.13 SE-HPLC chromatography
was performed using 0.2 mL/min of an isocratic flow consisting of
50% acetonitrile, 50% Millipore water and 0.1% trifluroacetic acid.

4.9 Mechanical Compression Tests
Compression
testing of the dry and wet cuboids (swollen in water at ambient conditions
for 16 h, slightly less than the maximum swelling time obtained for
these materials) was performed in an Instron 5944 Universal Testing
Machine, equipped with a 500 N load cell. The “dry”
specimens were conditioned at 50% RH for at least 72 h before testing.
The dimensions of the materials were measured at three different positions
using a Mitutoyo micrometer. A compression rate of 10 mm/min was used
in all cases. The compressive strength was taken as the stress at
yield, if the yield occurred before 10% strain, according to ASTM
D1621-16. The compression modulus (E) was obtained
from the slope of the linear region (typically below 5% strain) according
to the same standard. In addition, the stress at 10% strain and at
the deflection point in the stress–strain curve, from which
the densification of the porous foam starts, was determined for the
dry foams. The compression tests were performed at 23 °C and
50% RH using 3–4 specimens per sample with the longest side
of the cuboid foam in the strain direction.
