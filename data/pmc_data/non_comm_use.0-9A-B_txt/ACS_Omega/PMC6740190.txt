The cobalt(II) complex
salts [Co(bpy)(az)2](PF6)2 and [Co(az)4](PF6), each bearing
the unusual cis-N,N′-diphenylazodioxide ligand, were both screened as possible
anticancer agents against SK-HEP-1 liver cancer cells. Both compounds
were found to induce substantial apoptosis as an increasing function
of concentration and time. Measurement of apoptosis-related proteins
indicated that both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis
were activated. The apoptotic activity induced by these salts is not
displayed either by simple cobalt(II) salts or complexes or by the
free nitrosobenzene ligand. Additionally, these compounds did not
induce apoptosis, as assessed by poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)
polymerase cleavage, in several other cell lines.

Introduction
Since the discovery
of the antitumor activity of cisplatin by Rosenberg
and co-workers,1 it and other platinum
complexes have seen widespread use in the treatment of a variety of
cancers, and their mechanisms of action have been extensively explored.2 Other transition metals have been explored in
cancer therapy, such as ruthenium2a,2b,3 osmium,2c rhodium,4,5a and iridium,5 but nonplatinum anticancer
drugs in clinical use remain predominantly organic. In particular,
despite the high natural abundance of cobalt6 and the extensive synthetic chemistry of its complexes, there are,
to the best of our knowledge, so far no cobalt compounds in widespread
clinical use other than vitamin B12 (cobalamin),7 though the cobalt(III) imine complex CTC-96 (Doxovir)
has been explored as a treatment for herpes simplex virus,8 reaching phase II clinical trials.8b

Although a variety of cobalt compounds
have been shown to be cytotoxic
against certain cancer cell lines, those that have been demonstrated
to induce apoptosis remain fairly few in number. All of these complexes
feature cobalt in either the Co(II) or Co(III) oxidation state. Klegeris
and co-workers prepared a series of square-planar Co(II) complexes
of β-ketoaminato ligands, which increase the activation of caspase-3
and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.9 Pombeiro and co-workers showed that a series of Co(II) tris(pyrazolyl)methane
(“scorpionate”) complexes induced apoptosis in colorectal
and liver cancer cells, with the generation of oxygen-centered radicals
proposed as the mechanism of action based on their observed ability
to cleave plasmid DNA.10 Chiniforoshan
and co-workers showed that Co(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) complexes of
phenanthroline and the conjugate base of the natural product juglone
induced early-phase apoptosis in liver, cervical, and colorectal cancer
cells, likely involving intercalation with DNA.11

Gao and co-workers demonstrated that ellipsoid-shaped,
bimetallic
Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes with bis(pyrazolyl)phthalate bridging
ligands induced apoptosis in oral epithelial carcinoma cells, with
a proposed mechanism of DNA intercalation and cleavage.12 Similar behavior was observed by the same group
for both mono- and bimetallic Co(II) complexes of tris(imidazolyl)benzene,
with the monometallic complex being more potent.13 Ghosh and co-workers showed that a bimetallic Co(II) complex
with 4,4′-azopyridine as the bridging ligand was able to induce
apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells by a caspase- and p53-independent
mechanism proposed to consist of DNA binding followed by the generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS).14 Simpson
and co-workers demonstrated that a series of Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes
of benzyl carbazate-derived imines induced apoptosis in leukemia cells,
though the mechanism of apoptosis induction was not identified.15 Similarly, Katsaros and co-workers showed that
a series of bimetallic Co(II) complexes with macrocyclic ligands were
highly toxic to chronic myelogenous leukemia cells with little to
no necrosis observed, but the mechanism of cell death (and potential
apoptosis) was not identified.16

Co(III) complexes capable of inducing apoptosis include a bimetallic
Co(III) dihydrazide complex with a chiral helical structure, prepared
(as a racemic mixture) by Sladić and co-workers. This complex
was shown to increase the fraction of early apoptotic cells in samples
of breast cancer cells, but experiments with plasmid DNA indicated
that it did not induce apoptosis by DNA cleavage.17 Chen and co-workers prepared a pair of Co oxoisoaporphine
complexes, one Co(II) and one Co(III), and found that both induced
apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells by increasing
mitochondrial ROS levels and activating caspase-3 and caspase-9. Additionally,
the Co(III) complex was found to induce cell senescence by acting
as a telomerase inhibitor, binding strongly to G-quadruplex DNA.18

Satyanarayana and co-workers demonstrated
that a series of Co(III)
complexes of an imidazole-fused phenanthroline ligand induced apoptosis
in ovarian cancer cells. Experiments with plasmid DNA showed that
the complexes were potentially phototoxic, able to cleave plasmid
DNA when irradiated with UV light (365 nm) but not in the dark. It
was not, however, determined whether their induction of apoptosis
in ovarian cancer cells was photodependent.19 Filipović and co-workers prepared a series of cobalt complexes
of (chalcogen)semicarbazones, with a Co(II) complex of the O-donor
ligand and Co(III) complexes of the S- and Se-donor ligands. Each
of these complexes was shown to induce differentiation in all-trans
retinoic acid-resistant acute myeloid leukemia cells, and each was
cytotoxic toward cervical cancer cells, with the O-donor and S-donor
complexes inducing apoptosis by DNA damage from ROS generated by Fenton-type
reactions and by G2/M cell cycle arrest, respectively.20 Qin and co-workers showed that a Co(III) complex
of a substituted terpyridine induced G1-phase apoptosis in bladder
cancer cells, with a mechanism involving mitochondrial membrane depolarization,
caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation, and an increase in intracellular
Ca2+ levels.21

An important
subset of apoptosis-inducing cobalt complexes consists
of the Co(III) complexes of long-chain primary amine surfactants,
studied by Arunachalam and co-workers.22 These authors showed that undecylamine complexes formed micelles
at low concentrations and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells
with DNA damage and mitochondrial membrane depolarization.22a Further work by the same group showed that
one of these complexes caused downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation
of p53 in breast cancer cells, though long treatment times with this
complex resulted in some necrosis by oxidative stress, in addition
to apoptosis.22b These groups later demonstrated
that a related tetradecylamine complex induced apoptosis in cervical
cancer cells with DNA fragmentation, whereas a decylamine complex
induced apoptosis in liver cancer cells.22c Nagaraj and co-workers demonstrated that a related Co(III) decylamine
complex with different ancillary ligands was both an effective surfactant
and able to induce both apoptosis and necrosis in liver cancer cells.23

Recently, one of our groups has prepared
two novel Co(II) complexes
of the unusual ligand cis-N,N′-diphenylazodioxide (az): the six-coordinate, trigonal
prismatic complex salt [Co(bpy)(az)2](PF6)2, where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl (compound 1), and the eight-coordinate, tetragonal complex salt [Co(az)4](PF6)2 (compound 2), both
high-spin with three unpaired electrons per complex cation.24 The structures of 1 and 2 are shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Structures of Cobalt(II) Azodioxide Complexes 1 and 2
The unusual coordination
geometries for cobalt displayed by these
complexes, combined with the rarity of crystallographically characterized
azodioxide complexes of any metal,25 suggested
that they may display novel reactivity, including potentially novel
biological effects. We were, thus, inspired to investigate their biological
activity and medicinal potential. We have now found that each of compounds 1 and 2 induces apoptosis in human liver adenocarcinoma
(SK-HEP-1) cells and carried out a series of experiments to elucidate
the possible mechanisms of cytotoxicity.

Results and Discussion
We investigated the concentration-dependent changes in the SK-HEP-1
cell morphology induced by cobalt(II) azodioxide complexes. Cells
were treated with or without dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle control)
or compound 1 (Figure 1) or 2 (Figure 2) at concentrations of 1, 2, 5, or 10 μM
for 12 h. Cell morphology was examined by phase-contrast microscopy
under 20× magnification. Both compounds induced rounding and
detachment of cells suggestive of cell death in the culture. An increased
response by the cells to higher doses of the compounds was observed,
as more dead cells detached from the culture dishes after the concentration
of compound 1 or 2 was increased to 10 μM.

Figure 1 Cell morphology
after treatment with compound 1 for
12 h.

Figure 2 Cell morphology after treatment with compound 2 for
12 h.

We conducted flow cytometry measurements
of SK-HEP-1 cells after
treatment with each of compounds 1 and 2 at 10 μM for 12 h. The percentages of apoptotic cells were
significantly increased after treatment with compound 1 or 2 compared with control cells (Figure 3). After treatment with compound 1, the apoptotic population increased from 4.8 to 16.6%. With
compound 2, the apoptotic population increased from 4.8
to 22.5%. These results suggest that compounds 1 and 2 are able to efficiently induce apoptosis in SK-HEP-1 cells.
Fluorescence spectroscopy of compounds 1 and 2 showed that neither one displayed an emission spectrum, indicating
that fluorescence from neither compound served as an artifact in the
flow cytometry measurements.

Figure 3 Flow cytometry results for treatment with compounds 1 and 2 (10 μM, 12 h).

We next investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis
induced by compounds 1 and 2. We first examined
the proteolytic processing of caspases by immunoblotting analysis,
as it has been demonstrated that the activation of caspases plays
a vital role in apoptosis.26 Apoptosis
induced in SK-HEP-1 cells was involved with the cleavage of poly(adenosine
diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and the activation of procaspase-8
and procaspase-9, as assessed by the appearance of the respective
cleaved, active caspases compared to the control. The presence of
each of these apoptosis-related proteins was measured after treatment
with compounds 1 and 2 in both concentration-dependent
and time-dependent experiments.

To determine the involvement
of the caspases and PARP, we carried
out concentration-dependent treatments with compounds 1 or 2 for 12 h. Interestingly, the cleavage of both
procaspase-8 and procaspase-9 was observed at 5 and 10 μM concentrations
of each compound. The cleavage of PARP was observed slightly at 2
μM concentrations and increased significantly at 5 and 10 μM
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 Concentration-dependent
protein levels after 12 h of treatment
with compounds 1 or 2.

We also investigated the effect of compounds 1 and 2 on other pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. The levels of
these proteins were significantly regulated after treatment with compound 1 or 2 compared to the control, in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 4).

In addition, we found that the apoptosis-related proteins were
affected in a time-dependent manner compared to the control upon treatment
with compound 1 or 2 at 2 μM concentration.
Substantial amounts of cleaved PARP, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were
observed as early as 6 h after treatment with 1 or 2. There are a variety of gene products involved in the process
of cell apoptosis. A well-known group of these gene products is the
Bcl-2 family, which includes both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic members.27 Upon the treatments, the level of Bcl-2, an
antiapoptotic member, decreased over time, whereas BAD and Bim, two
proapoptotic members, were upregulated (Figure 5). These data not only confirmed that compounds 1 and 2 induced the apoptosis of SK-HEP-1 cells
in a concentration- and time-dependent manner but also indicated that
they induced apoptosis via both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways,
since both procaspase-8 and procaspase-9 were cleaved after treatment.28 The cleavage of procaspase-8, involved in the
extrinsic pathway, occurred to a greater extent than the cleavage
of procaspase-9, involved in the intrinsic pathway,28 suggesting that more apoptosis proceeded by the extrinsic
pathway than the intrinsic one.

Figure 5 Time-dependent protein levels after treatment
with compounds 1 or 2 at 2 μM concentration.

Cobalt(II) salts are known to induce oxidative
DNA damage via the
generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical and
superoxide, akin to the iron-catalyzed Fenton reactions.29 Additionally, the mechanism of apoptosis induced
by some cobalt complexes has been proposed to involve the generation
of ROS and subsequent oxidative DNA damage.10,14,20 Thus, we decided to examine the possibility
of ROS involvement in the proapoptotic activities of 1 and 2. We treated SK-HEP-1 cells with several different
concentrations of 1 and 2 for an incubation
time of 14 h and then ran a fluorescence-based ROS assay. This assay
showed significant increases in ROS levels at high concentrations
of 1 and 2, but only modest increases in
ROS levels at concentrations used in the flow cytometry and western
blot assays (Figure 6). These results suggest that 1 and 2 do
not induce apoptosis primarily via ROS-mediated DNA damage.

Figure 6 Effect of compounds 1 and 2 on ROS levels
in SK-HEP-1 cells.

We performed the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay to assess the cytotoxicity of both 1 and 2 to SK-HEP-1. We incubated cells with 1 or 2 for 48 h at a series of concentrations (5.12 nM,
25.6 nM, 128 nM, 640 nM, 3.2 μM, 16 μM, 80 μM, 400
μM, 2 mM) and then performed the MTT assay. This assay showed
a significant loss of cell viability only at 400 μM and 2 mM
concentrations of 1 or 2. These are higher
doses than those shown to induce substantial cell death by phase-contrast
microscopy (Figures 1 and2), apoptosis and necrosis by flow cytometry
(Figure 3), and the
upregulation of proapoptotic proteins and downregulation of antiapoptotic
proteins by western blot (Figures 4 and 5). The MTT assay has been
shown to overestimate cell viability (and underestimate cytotoxicity)
in certain cases,30 which may explain the
apparent discrepancy between it and the other assays.

The ability
of compounds 1 and 2 to induce
PARP cleavage was shown to be cell line-specific. We treated several
other cell lines with 2 and 10 μM concentrations of 1 and 2 for 12 h: HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney cells),
HT-29 (colon cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), and PC-3 (prostate cancer).
In none of these cases, extensive PARP cleavage was observed compared
to the response of SK-HEP-1 to 1 and 2.
These results suggest that 1 and 2 may allow
for the selective apoptosis of liver cancer cells, with minimal harm
to the surrounding tissue. The western blots from these experiments
are shown in Figures S1–S4 (see
the Supporting Information).

We also examined whether the starting
materials used in the synthesis
of compounds 1 and 2 were capable of causing
apoptosis by themselves. These compounds included CoCl2, used in the synthesis of compound 2, Co(bpy)Cl2,31 used in the synthesis of compound 1, nitrosobenzene (PhNO), used in the synthesis of both compounds,
and the additional compound Co(phen)Cl2,32 where phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, a compound related to
Co(bpy)Cl2. Interestingly, treatment of SK-HEP-1 cells
with each of these compounds for 12 h at 10 μM did not lead
in any case to significant PARP cleavage compared with that observed
after treatment with 1 or 2 (Figure 7). We observed minor PARP cleavage
after treatment with CoCl2 but much less than that observed
after treatment with 1 or 2 at this concentration
and time.

Figure 7 Effect of starting materials and Co(phen)Cl2 (12 h,
10 μM) on PARP cleavage.

Due to the small number of azodioxide complexes known, it is difficult
to identify a structure–activity relationship with confidence
regarding the biological activity of such complexes. As 1 and 2 are the only cobalt azodioxide complexes known,
the differences in their coordination numbers and geometries cannot
be compared in depth. The data do suggest, however, that the azodioxide
ligand is essential to the activity. The inactivity of CoCl2, Co(bpy)Cl2, and Co(phen)Cl2 toward the induction
of PARP cleavage demonstrates the neither Co(II) alone nor Co(II)
bound to a π-delocalized, redox-active ligand33 such as bpy or phen is necessary to induce apoptosis. The
azodioxide ligand, although stable in the solid state, dissociates
to monomeric PhNO in the solution, which is also inactive toward the
induction of PARP cleavage. We propose that the stabilization of dimeric
azodioxide by coordination is responsible for the proapoptotic activity.
Nicholas and co-workers have shown that the iron azodioxide compound
[Fe(az)3](FeCl4)2 is capable of catalyzing
allylic amination/C–C double-bond migration reactions of alkenes,
with a mechanism proposed to involve the transfer of a PhNO moiety
from a coordinated azodioxide to an alkene in a nitroso-ene-type reaction.25b PhNO transfer from 1 and 2 to unsaturated biomolecules may be involved in their proapoptotic
activity. The low levels of ROS generated at the concentrations of 1 and 2 shown to induce apoptosis suggest that
ROS generation through Fenton-type electron transfer reactions is
at best a minor contribution to the proapoptotic activity of these
compounds.

Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated that
each of compounds 1 and 2 induces apoptosis
in SK-HEP-1 cells and
examined their mechanisms of action. Our results showed that the compounds
induce apoptosis via both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, though
with a preference for the extrinsic pathway. Both compounds induce
the cleavage of PARP and the activation of procaspase-8 and procaspase-9.
It is clear that the activation of procaspase-8 proceeded to a greater
extent than that of procaspase-9. Additionally, we found that both
compounds led to a significant decrease in the levels of the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl-2 as well as an increase in the expression of Bim and
BAD, members of the Bcl-2 family that promote apoptosis. Future work
will consist of examining the pharmacological potential of 1 and 2 in mouse models of liver adenocarcinoma. Mechanistically,
the effect of 1 and 2 on additional apoptosis-related
proteins, such as the NEDD8-activating enzyme,34 Wee1,35 Cdc2,35b and Pin1,36 will be examined.
Additionally, transition-metal azodioxide complexes synthesized in
the future will be screened for potential anticancer activity against
SK-HEP-1 liver cancer cells and other types of cancer cells.

Methods
Reagents
and Antibodies
Compounds 1 and 2, Co(bpy)Cl2 were prepared as previously described
by the Boyd group.24 Co(phen)Cl2 was prepared as described by Nami and Siddiqi.32 Antibodies to PARP, procaspase-8, cleaved caspase-8, procaspase-9,
cleaved caspase-9, Bim, Bcl-2, and BAD were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). The antibody to GAPDH was obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX).

Cell Culture and Treatment
SK-HEP-1 and other cells
were grown in RPMI-1640 (purchased from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation
Core Facility) supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone) and
1% antibiotics. The cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2 at 37 °C. When the cell confluence reached
70%, the cells were treated with or without compound 1 or 2 at different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 5, or 10
μM) for a given amount of time (1, 6, 12, 24, or 36 h). Compounds 1 and 2 were dissolved in DMSO before being diluted
in the aqueous solution.

Morphology of Apoptotic Cells
An
inverted phase-contrast
fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Heidenheimer, Germany) was used
to directly observe morphological changes in the cell line after treatment
with 1 or 2. Cells were seeded into 6-well
(12 × 104 cells/well) plates, cultured to confluence,
and treated with a solution of compound 1 or 2 at the relevant concentration at 37 °C for 12 h. After the
12 h treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
and images were taken from five random fields for each well.

Western
Blot Analysis
After treatments, cells were
washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected with a scraper. Total
protein extracts were prepared by the suspension of cell pellets in
Triton-X 100 lysis buffer (50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Tris-X 100,
and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). After centrifugation at
20 000g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C
for 10 min, the total protein in the supernatant was measured using
a UV-1280 UV–visible spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
Equal amounts of protein from each sample were introduced to 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis,
proteins were transferred to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane
using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 3 wet transfer unit at 100 V for 80 min.
The membrane was then incubated with 5% nonfat milk in TBST buffer
(1 mM Tris with pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20) for 1 h at room
temperature. The membrane was then incubated with a primary antibody
in TBST overnight at 4 °C. After several washes with TBST, the
membrane was incubated with the relevant horseradish peroxidase-linked
secondary antibody diluted 1:3000, followed by three washes. The membrane
was then processed with the Pierce ECL Plus Western Blotting Substrate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the enhanced chemoluminescence
signal acquired.

Flow Cytometry Analysis of Apoptosis
An Annexin V fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis detection kit
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used. Briefly, following treatment
with compound 1 or 2 (10 μM for 12
h), SK-HEP-1 cells (1 × 105 cells/sample) were collected
in cold PBS, centrifuged at 1500g at 4 °C for
5 min, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer
(100 μL/sample). Each sample was stained with Annexin V-FITC
(5 μL) and PI (5 μL) in the dark at 4 °C for 15 min,
and 400 μL 1× binding buffer was added. The cells were
immediately analyzed with a flow cytometer equipped with the BD FACSDiva
software (BD Biosciences). Annexin V-FITC–/PI– cells were identified as viable, Annexin V-FITC+/PI– cells were identified as early apoptotic,
Annexin V-FITC+/PI+ cells were identified as
late apoptotic, and Annexin V-FITC–/PI+ cells were identified as necrotic.37 Fluorescence
spectroscopy of compounds 1 and 2, as a
control, was performed on a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer.
No emission peaks were observed for acetonitrile solutions of either
compound.

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Assay
A fluorometric
intracellular ROS kit (Sigma-Aldrich, product number MAK143) was used
to test for the production of ROS during the treatment of SK-HEP-1
cells with 1 or 2. Briefly, cells were grown
overnight in the medium in a 96-well plate at 4000 cells/well. The
master reaction mix was prepared according to the protocol provided
by Sigma-Aldrich, and 100 μL of this mixture was added to each
well. The cells were incubated for 1 h and then treated with the relevant
concentrations of 1 or 2 with PBS buffer.
After further incubation for 14 h, the fluorescence intensity was
measured on a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer, with an excitation
wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. Each treatment
was performed with 16 replicates.

MTT Assay
Cells
were grown overnight in the medium
in a 96-well plate at 3000 cells/well. The growth medium was replaced
by the relevant concentrations of 1 or 2, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. An MTT solution was prepared
as a 1:3 ratio of 5 mg/mL MTT and growth medium, and 100 μL
of this MTT solution was added to each well. The cells were then incubated
for a further 2–4 h, after which 200 μL of DMSO was added
to each well. Once all precipitates had dissolved, absorbance was
measured at 570 nm. Each treatment was performed with 8 replicates.
