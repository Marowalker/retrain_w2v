Upon
mass selection and ion activation under mass spectrometric
conditions, gaseous formate adducts of many metal formates undergo
decarboxylation and form product ions that bear metal–hydrogen
bonds. Fortuitously, we noted that negative-ion spectra of several
such formate adducts showed many peaks that could not be rationalized
by the conventional fragmentation pathways attributed to the precursor
ion. Subsequent experimentation proved that these enigmatic peaks
are due to an ion–molecule reaction that takes place between
traces of adventitious water vapor in the collision gas and the in
situ formed product anions bearing metal–hydrogen bonds, generated
by the fragmentation of the formate adducts. Results show that metal–hydrogen
bonds of the group 2 elements are particularly susceptible to this
reaction. For example, in the product-ion spectrum of [Sr(η2-O2CH)3]−, the peak at m/z 91 for SrH3– was accompanied by three peaks at higher m/z ratios. These peaks, at m/z 107, 123, and 139, represented SrH2(OH)1–, SrH1(OH)2–, and Sr(OH)3–, respectively.
These satellite peaks, which were separated by 16 m/z units, were attributed to adducts formed due
to the high affinity of gas-phase anions bearing metal–hydrogen
bonds to water. Although undesired, these peaks are diagnostically
useful to determine the number of metal–hydrogen bonds present
in a precursor ion. Even though the peaks were less pronounced, analogous
reactions were noted from the adducts of the group 1 elements as well.
Moreover, Gibbs free energy values computed for the interaction of
[H-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− with water to form [HO-Mg(η2-OCOH)2]− and H2 indicated that this is an exergonic
reaction.

Introduction
Unwarranted ion–molecule
reactions that occur under tandem
mass-spectrometric conditions are often a nuisance because they complicate
spectral interpretations.1 Occasionally,
such reactions take place in the ion source under electrospray ionization
(ESI) conditions.2−5 Ion–molecule reactions are more common in mass spectrometric
investigations conducted in tandem-in-time devices, such as ion traps,
because the ions are stored in a confined space for a relatively longer
period of time prior to ion activation.6−9 Although less common, ion-neutral adduct
peaks have also been observed in the spectra recorded on tandem-in-space
instruments when reactants such as water,10−13 methanol, ethanol, nitrogen,14,15 oxygen,16 and carbon dioxide17 are either present as impurities, or added intentionally
as reagents to the collision gas.18,19

Once
comprehended, these ion–molecule reactions can become
a powerful tool for structural elucidations.20−23 For example, such reactions have
been employed to differentiate among different types of isomers.24 However, the presence of unexpected adduct peaks
makes the interpretation of mass spectrometry (MS)/MS data, or quantitation
by targeted scan modes, more complicated. There is a strong inclination
to rely on artificial intelligence computer programs for positive
compound identification.25,26 However, unwarranted
ion–molecule reactions could easily lead to false-positive
dubious results.

Among ion–molecule reactions, the addition
of water is the
most commonly encountered transformation. Water adds not only to positively
charged reaction centers but also to anions.27−29 Recently, we
published a paper on periodic trends in the fragmentation patterns
of formate adducts of metal formate anions generated from groups 1
to 2 and groups 13 to 15 metals of the periodic table.30 Upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), the
formate adducts of metal formates undergo decarboxylation to form
ionic products that bear metal–hydrogen bonds. The spectra
reported previously showed several peaks that could not be attributed
to ions originating from direct dissociation of mass-selected precursor
ions. Herein, we present details of an extensive study to demonstrate
that the enigmatic peaks originate from an ion–molecule reaction
between product ions that bear M–H bonds and traces of water
present in the collision gas.

Results and Discussion
Under negative-ion-generating
electrospray ionization conditions,
ion pairs of metal formates generate gaseous adducts with formate
anions. Such formate adducts, upon mass selection and ion activation
under mass spectrometric conditions, typically dissociate by losing
either a molecule of the metal formate to form the formate anion or
by ejecting a molecule of CO2 (decarboxylation) to form
an anion bearing a metal–hydrogen bond.30 Acetate adducts of alkaline-earth metal acetates [Metal(O2CCH3)3]− are known
to fragment analogously, and form the organometallate anions [CH3Metal(O2CCH3)2]− by ejecting CO2.31

For
the adducts of alkali formates (group 1 elements), the ejection
of a neutral metal formate molecule to generate the formate ion is
the more favorable mechanism. In contrast, the decarboxylation process
is the preferred fragmentation pathway for the adducts of groups 2,
13, 14, and 15 metal formates.30 However,
in addition to the peaks expected for the products of the two predicted
pathways, the MS2 spectra recorded from the formate adducts
of metal formates showed several additional peaks. At first blush,
these peaks appeared to be enigmatic. For example, an ESI product-ion
mass spectrum recorded from m/z 97
as the precursor ion generated from an aqueous solution of lithium
formate showed peaks at m/z 45 and
53, representing the formate anion and the decarboxylated precursor
ion ([H-Li-O2CH]–), respectively (Figure 1). Albeit small,
a peak was also noted at m/z 69
(Supporting Information Figure S1). The
nominal m/z value of this ion was
28 Da smaller than that of the precursor ion (m/z 97) and 16 Da higher than that of the m/z 53 ion formed from decarboxylation. Arguably,
the m/z 69 ion could be attributed
to a loss of either a carbon monoxide molecule from the precursor
ion (m/z 97) or the formation of
a mono-oxygen adduct from the m/z 53 ion.

Figure 1 Product-ion spectrum of the mass-selected m/z 97 ion for [Li(η2-O2CH)2]− generated by electrospraying an aqueous
solution of lithium formate. The spectrum was recorded on a Synapt
G2 instrument at a transfer collision energy setting of 5.5 eV and
a resolving power of 10 000 at m/z 97.

A similar, but a more pronounced
set of enigmatic peaks were observed
in the spectra recorded from group 2 metal formates (Figure 2). To start with, the formate
adducts of magnesium and calcium formates can undergo two consecutive
CO2 losses (decarboxylation steps): m/z 159 [Mg(O2CH)3]− → m/z 115 [H-Mg(O2CH)2]−→ m/z 71 [H2-Mg(O2CH)]−, and m/z 175 [Ca(O2CH)3]− → m/z 131 [H-Ca(O2CH)2]−→ m/z 87 [H2-Ca(O2CH)]−, respectively. In the spectrum recorded
for magnesium formate, there was an unaccounted additional peak at m/z 131 (Figure 2A). Likewise, an analogous peak appeared
at m/z 147 in the calcium-formate
spectrum (Figure 2B).
Moreover, between the peaks for the first and the second decarboxylation
steps, there was one additional peak at m/z 87  ([H-Mg(OH)(η2-O2CH)]−) in the magnesium-formate
spectrum (Figure 2A)
and two additional peaks at m/z 103 and 119, in the calcium-formate spectrum (Figure 2B). Because the nominal
masses of m/z 103 and 119 ion were
16 and 32 Da higher than that of the m/z 87 ion ([H2-Ca(η2-O2CH)]−), respectively, these ions appeared
to be formed by the addition of one or two oxygen atoms to the m/z 87 ion (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 Product-ion spectrum of m/z 159

resolving power of 9000 at m/z 157)
(A). Product-ion spectrum of m/z 175 for [Ca(η2-O2CH)3]− (recorded at a transfer collision energy setting of
10.0 eV and a resolving power of 9000 at m/z 175) (B). Product-ion spectrum of m/z 223 for [Sr(η2-O2CH)3]− (recorded at a transfer collision energy setting
of 25.0 eV and a resolving power of 11 000 at m/z 223) (C). Product-ion spectrum of m/z 273 for [Ba(η2-O2CH)3]− (recorded at a transfer collision
energy setting of 30.0 eV and a resolving power of 10 000 at m/z 273) (D). All spectra were recorded
on a Synapt G2 instrument under negative-ion-generating ESI conditions.

As previously reported,30 the formate
adduct of strontium formate can undergo three consecutive CO2 losses under high collision energy conditions: m/z 223 [Sr(O2CH)3]− → m/z 179 [H-Sr(O2CH)2]−→ m/z 135 [H2-Sr(O2CH)]− → m/z 91 [SrH3]− (Scheme 1). Along with these expected peaks, representing the fragment
ions formed from the first, second, and third decarboxylation processes,
there were one (m/z 195, marked
red in Figure 2C),
two (m/z 103 and 119, marked in
blue), and three (m/z 107, 123,
and 139, marked in green) additional peak sets that could not be rationalized
by the main fragmentation mechanisms (Figure 2C). For example, the ions detected at m/z 107, 123, and 139 as shown in the spectrum
depicted in Figure 2C appeared to be associated with the m/z 91 ion that originated from a triple decarboxylation of the precursor m/z 223 ion. The nominal masses of the
ions corresponding to the m/z 107,
123, and 139 peaks were 16, 32, or 48 Da higher than that of the m/z 91 ion. At first look, these enigmatic
ions appeared to represent the consecutive addition of a 16 Da “oxygen
atoms” to the m/z 91 ion.
To gain insights into the origin of these intriguing sets of ions,
the m/z 135 ion was generated by
collision-induced dissociation in the ion source by increasing the
cone-voltage conditions. The m/z 135 ion, which originated from two consecutive CO2 losses
from the precursor ion [Sr(η2-O2CH)3]− (Scheme 1), was mass-selected and passed through the transfer
collision cell under very mild fragmentation conditions. Interestingly,
in the product-ion spectrum recorded, there were peaks at m/z ratios higher than that of the mass-selected
precursor ion (Figure 3). Evidently, ions such as m/z 139,
151, and 167 were products of a neutral-gain process that took place
by ion–molecule reactions in the collision cell.

Figure 3 Product-ion
spectrum recorded at a transfer collision energy setting
of 2 eV from the [H2-Sr(η2-O2CH)]− ion (m/z 135) generated in source at a cone voltage of 100 V. The spectrum
was recorded on a Synapt G2 instrument under negative-ion-generating
ESI mode at a resolving power of 7500 at m/z 135.

Pathways of the Formate Adduct of Strontium
Formate [Sr(η2-O2CH)3]− to Form [SrH3]− by Three
Consecutive CO2 Losses and Ion–Molecule Reactions
between Each Complex Bearing Strontium–Hydrogen Bonds and H2O
To verify the origin of the
atom(s) added during the formation of these enigmatic ions, first
we determined the accurate masses (Supporting Information Table S1). The results agreed with the values
predicted for increases due to the addition of one or more oxygen
atoms. To confirm the prediction, a sample of Sr(η2-18O2CH)2 was synthesized and its
CID spectrum was recorded. The product-ion spectrum of the m/z 235 ion for [Sr(η2-18O2CH)3]− showed
an intense peak at m/z 187 for a
48 Da C18O2 loss, which was accompanied by a
peak at m/z 203 (Figure 4B). This result proved that
the additional oxygen atom required for the formation of the m/z 203 ion does not originate from any
of the oxygen atoms of the precursor ion. In other words, an extraneous
oxygen atom is added to the product ion(s) that originate from decarboxylation(s)
(Figure 4B). Since
a direct addition of an oxygen atom by itself is unlikely, we envisaged
that the fragment ion is reacting with traces of water in a manner
similar to the known behavior of metal hydrides in aqueous solutions.
Metal–hydrogen bonds are known to be highly susceptible to
moisture, forming products with metal–hydroxide bonds.12,13,32 If this indeed were the case,
the hydrogen atom in the OH groups of the enigmatic ions should 
also be from an external source, and not from the original hydrogens
in the M–H bonds. To verify this, a sample of Sr(O2CD)2 was synthesized. The CID spectrum of m/z 226 ion for [Sr(η2-O2CD)3]− showed a peak at m/z 197, depicting a 15 Da separation from the m/z 182 ion: this proved that the deuteride,
initially attached to the strontium atom, was replaced by an extraneous
hydroxyl group during the ion–molecule reaction (Figure 4C). Thus, it was clear that
ions with metal–hydrogen bonds react with minute traces of
moisture present in the collision gas [although 4.8 grade is claimed
to be “dry” by the suppliers, its purity is 99.998%
and it could contain up to 3 ppm (v/v) H2O] and produce
an M–OH bond. In other words, the interaction of water with
a metal–hydrogen bond leads to the formation of a metal–OH
bond by the elimination a molecule of dihydrogen (Scheme 1). Thus, the peaks at m/z 151 and 167 in Figures 2C and 3 can be attributed
to the products formed by the interaction of water with the m/z 135 ion (Figures 2 and 3). Analogously,
the m/z 195 ion originated from
the reaction with the m/z 179 ion
(Figures 2C and 4A).

Figure 4 Product-ion spectrum of the m/z 223 ion for [Sr(η2-O2CH)3]− recorded at a transfer collision energy
setting
of 10 eV and a resolving power of 11 000 at m/z 223 (A). A product-ion spectrum of the m/z 235 ion for [Sr(η2-18O2CH)3]− recorded
at a transfer collision energy setting of 10 eV and a resolving power
of 10 500 at m/z 235 (B).
A product-ion spectrum of the m/z 226 ion for [Sr(η2-O2CD)3]− recorded at a transfer collision energy setting
of 10 eV and a resolving power of 11 000 at m/z 226 (C). All the spectra a recorded on a Synapt
G2 instrument in negative-ion-generating ESI mode.

Evidently, the H2 elimination reaction
follows an explicit
pathway because a product-ion spectrum of the m/z 138 ion for [D2-Sr(η2-O2CD)1]− showed peaks at m/z 109, 124, and 139. These ions originated
from the interaction of H2O with the SrD3– ion (m/z 94) (Figure 5). For the formation
of the m/z 109 ion, the m/z 94 ion interacts with H2O and eliminates specifically a molecule of HD. In this way, the
dubious 15 Da increases from the m/z 94 could be rationalized (Scheme 2).

Figure 5 Product-ion spectrum of the m/z 138 ion for [D2-Sr(η2-O2CD)1]− generated in source by
electrospraying
an aqueous solution of Sr(O2CD)2 at a cone voltage
of 100 V. The spectrum was recorded at a transfer collision energy
setting of 2 eV on a Synapt G2 instrument in negative-ion-generating
ESI mode.

Scheme 2 Ion–Molecule Reaction of SrH3– (A) and SrD3– (B) with H2O
Although less reactive to water than the Ca–H and
Sr–H
bonds, the Ba–H bond formed by CID decarboxylation of [Ba(η2-O2CH)3]− is also
susceptible to traces of water in the collision gas. For example,
the peaks at m/z 201 and 217 in
the product-ion spectrum (Figure 2D) are due to [H-Ba(OH)(η2-O2CH)]− and [Ba(OH)2(η2-O2CH)]−, respectively.

To support
the reaction mechanisms proposed for the water interaction,
we conducted a computational study on the following system (Scheme 3). The calculated
Gibbs free energies of reactants and products predicted that the water
interaction, [H-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− + H2O → [HO-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− + H2 (Scheme 3),
is an exergonic reaction. This is not a surprise because the higher
affinity of group 2 elements for oxygen is well known.

Scheme 3 Formation
of [HO-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− from an Ion–Molecule Reaction between
[H-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− and H2O
Moreover, computations also indicated that as a water
molecule
approaches the [H-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− ion, one of its formate moieties opens up and
becomes monodentate when the reactant complex (2) is
formed (Figure 6 and
Supporting Information Table S4). Upon
activation of the reaction complex (2), the monodentate
formate moiety pivots back and becomes bidentate again as it reaches
the transition state (3), where the Mg–H bond
is more elongated. As the reaction proceeds to form the product complex
(4), the Mg–OH and H–H bonds become shorter
(Figure 6 and Supporting
Information Table S6). Finally, the two
entities in the product complex (4) are separated to
give [H-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− as the final product.

for 298.15 K
and 1 atm, by the density functional theory method B3LYP using a 6-311++G(2d,2p)
basis set] and structures of energy-optimized product ions and transition
states associated with the interaction of water with the m/z 115, [H-Mg(η2-O2CH)2]− ion (1) with water.

Generally, ion–molecule
reactions taking place in the collision
cell are considered a nuisance because they may obscure the true identity
of the precursor ions. However, peaks attributed to water interactions
observed in the present study are in fact diagnostically useful because
the number of so-called “oxygen-adduct” peaks that accompany
the specific precursor-ion peak enable the enumeration the metal–hydrogen
bonds present in the precursor ion. For example, in Figure 3, the peaks at m/z 151 (135 + 16) and 167 (135 + 32) indicate the
presence of two Sr–H bonds in the m/z 135 precursor. Analogously, the peaks at m/z 107 (91 + 16), 123 (91 + 32), and 139 (91 + 48)
show the presence of three Sr–H bonds in m/z 91. Apparently, the H2 elimination
reported here is analogous to the CH4 loss reported in
the formation of metal–hydrogen bonds from organometallic ions
such as [(CH3M(O2CCH3))n]− upon interaction with water.31 Moreover, an analogous water addition reaction
followed by a subsequent H2 loss has been observed previously
by Osburn et al.12 during their studies
under positive-ion-generating conditions with mixed-metal complexes
containing silver, calcium, and deprotonated glycine. Interestingly,
when silver was the only metal present, then only the addition of
water took place without the loss of H2. Analogously, tandem
mass spectra of certain mass-selected product ions bearing metal–hydrogen
bonds generated by the collision-induced dissociation of anionic uranyl
complexes [UO2(O2C-H)3]− have been observed to show a peak at 16 mass units greater than
that of the precursor ion.13 Our results
are congruent with the conclusions made by Perez et al. that these
ions are formed by a process that involves H2O addition
and H2 elimination.13

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the utility of adventitious traces of water
in the argon collision gas to enumerate the metal–hydrogen
bonds present in gas-phase anions generated during the fragmentation
of formate adducts of various metal formates. However “dry”
the collision gas may be labeled, there is sufficient water vapor
present in ppm concentrations for it to cause the emergence of MS
peaks, spaced at 16 Da at higher m/z values than those of the corresponding precursor ions bearing metal–hydrogen
bonds. The number of those peaks indicates the number of M–H
bonds present in the precursor ion.

Experimental Section
Mass Spectrometry
A Synapt G2 HDMS (Waters, U.K.) mass
spectrometer equipped with an ESI source was used for high-resolution
and accurate-mass collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments.
Using a syringe pump, sample solutions were infused to the ion source
at a rate of 20 μL/min. Typically, the capillary voltage was
set to 2.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizer gas. The desolvation
gas (N2) flow rate was 500 L/h. High-purity argon (Grade
4.8, 99.998%, Praxair, Inc., Danbury, CT) was used as the collision
gas of Trap and Transfer collision cells at a pressure setting of
8 × 10–6 bar (however, the pressure of the
transfer collision cell was slightly higher than that in the Trap
collision cell). For CID experiments, the trap collision energy was
kept at 4 eV, and the transfer collision energy was varied between
2 and 30 eV. The source and desolvation gas temperatures were held
at 100 and 150 °C, respectively. Mass calibration (m/z 20–1200) was performed using a 100 ppm
sodium formate solution in 50% isopropyl alcohol: 50% water (v/v).
The instrument was operated at a resolving power of 10 000
measured at m/z 97.

Chemicals
Millipore water was obtained from Milli-Q
water system. Acetonitrile was purchased from PHARMCO-AAPER (Brookfield,
CT). Formic acid (88%), barium hydroxide, and calcium oxide were obtained
from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Metal magnesium turnings,
lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium formate, rubidium chloride,
cesium carbonate, and formic acid-d2 (95
wt % in D2O, 98 atom % D) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Saint Louis, MO). Strontium carbonate was obtained from J. T. Baker
(Avantor, Center Valley, PA). H218O was purchased
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). All chemicals
were used without further purification.

Metal Formates
All formates that were not commercially
available were prepared as described previously.30 To prepare 18O-substituted strontium formate, formic acid
(96%, 10.00 μL) was dissolved in H218O
(25 μL). After 12 h, the HC18O2H prepared
in this way was added to SrCO3 (0.0105 g, 0.07 mmol) and
the mixture was diluted with Millipore water. Analogously, deuterium-substituted
strontium formate was synthesized by adding formic acid-d2 (95 wt % in D2O, 98 atom % D) to SrCO3.

Sample Preparation
Samples for MS analyses were prepared
in water as 100 ppm solutions. Using a syringe pump, all solutions
were infused at a flow rate of 20 μL/min.

Computational
Methods
All DFT calculations were carried
out using the Gaussian 09W33 program. Proposed
structures were fully optimized by using the B3LYP34,35 hybrid density functional method with a large 6-311++g(2d,2p) basis
set. Complete geometry optimizations were conducted at the same level
for all species to verify the nature of each stationary state on the
potential energy surface. In other words, reactants and products are
associated with all positive vibrational frequencies, whereas transition
states (TS) are associated with only one imaginary frequency, for
which the normal vibrational mode corresponds to the expected bond
formation/breaking movements in a specific reaction pathway. Gibbs
free energies calculations were conducted for species at ambient pressure
(1 atm) and room temperature (298.15 K).
