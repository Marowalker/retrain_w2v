Silica
nonwoven fabrics (SNFs) with enough mechanical strength
are candidates as implantable scaffolds. Culture of cells therein
is expected to affect the proliferation and differentiation of the
cells through cell–cell and cell–SNF interactions. In
this study, we examined three-dimensional (3D) SNFs as a scaffold
of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for bone tissue engineering applications.
The interconnected highly porous microstructure of 3D SNFs is expected
to allow omnidirectional cell–cell interactions, and the morphological
similarity of a silica nanofiber to that of a fibrous extracellular
matrix can contribute to the promotion of cell functions. 3D SNFs
were prepared by the sol–gel process, and their mechanical
properties were characterized by the compression test and rheological
analysis. In the compression test, SNFs showed a compressive elastic
modulus of over 1 MPa and a compressive strength of about 200 kPa.
These values are higher than those of porous polystyrene disks used
for in vitro 3D cell culture. In rheological analysis, the elastic
modulus and fracture stress were 3.27 ± 0.54 kPa and 25.9 ±
8.3 Pa, respectively. Then, human bone marrow-derived MSCs were cultured
on SNFs, and the effects on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation
were evaluated. The MSCs seeded on SNF proliferated, and the thickness
of the cell layer became over 80 μm after 14 days of culture.
The osteogenic differentiation of MSCs on SNFs was induced by the
culture in the commercial osteogenic differentiation medium. The alkaline
phosphatase activity of MSCs on SNFs increased rapidly and remained
high up to 14 days and was much higher than that on two-dimensional
tissue culture-treated polystyrene. The high expression of RUNX2 and intense staining by alizarin red s after differentiation
supported that SNFs enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.
Furthermore, permeation analysis of SNFs using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran
suggested a sufficient permeability of SNFs for oxygen, minerals,
nutrients, and secretions, which is important for maintaining the
cell viability and vitality. These results suggested that SNFs are
promising scaffolds for the regeneration of bone defects using MSCs,
originated from highly porous and elastic SNF characters.

Introduction
In tissue engineering
for regenerative medicine and in vitro assay
technology, a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system mimicking
in vivo environment provided higher cellular functionality than a
traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture.1 There are various culture methods of cells in a 3D system, for example,
spheroid formation2,3 and seeding in scaffolds such
as polymer hydrogels,4 porous materials,5 and fibrous fabrics.6

Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been receiving
much
attention as a cell source for cell therapy and tissue engineering
applications.7 The MSCs isolated from bone
marrow8 and adipose tissue9 have the ability to differentiate into various types of
cells in mesodermal lineages, such as osteoblasts,10 chondrocytes,11 adipocytes,12 myocytes,13 and cardiomyocytes.14 Bone regeneration using MSCs is a new therapeutic
approach for large bone defects.15 MSCs
were transplanted with scaffolds and differentiated into osteoblasts
and osteocytes, and secreted bone matrices were connected with the
surrounding bone tissues.

For these cell differentiations, particularly
MSCs, 3D fibrous
fabrics prepared by electrospinning techniques showed highly suitable
properties16 because of their morphological
similarity to that of the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM). Nonwoven
nano- and microfibrous scaffolds of polymers such as poly (ε-caprolactone),17 poly(ethylene terephthalate),18 poly-l-lactide,19 polyethersulfone,20 and their compositions21 including other components have been developed. Fabrics prepared
by electrospinning are not limited to polymers. The 3D silica nonwoven
fabrics (SNFs) with interconnected highly porous microstructures have
also been developed by electrospinning through the sol–gel
process22−24 and are used for cell culture in a differentiated
state.25,26 The silica obtained by the sol–gel
process shows high biocompatibility and bioactivity.27 Many interconnected pores were provided by the random orientation
of the silica fibers, and cells can migrate and grow, preventing shrinkage
because of their enough mechanical strength. SNFs have been applied
for the construction of 3D tumor models25 and a coculture system.26 Cancer cells
cultured in SNFs showed poorer response to anticancer agents by the
upregulation of genes such as BCL2, and potentials
of SNFs for the construction of 3D tumor models in vitro were suggested.25 We have clearly demonstrated the utility for
a tissue-engineered construct: a fibroblast migrated and penetrated
in SNFs and showed remarkable growth rates compared to the traditional
2D culture.26 Furthermore, the functions
of hepatocytes cocultured with the fibroblast in SNFs were significantly
higher than those cocultured with the 2D fibroblast because of the
abundance of fibroblast-secreted soluble factors, which is important
for maintaining the function of hepatocytes.26

One of silica-based materials, bioactive glass containing
additives
such as sodium oxide, calcium, and phosphate, has been widely used
as an implantable material for bone regeneration because of its osteoconductive,
osteoproductive, and osteoinductive properties.28−31 For example, the osteoconductivity
of polyethersulfone nanofibers was enhanced by loading with bioactive
glass nanoparticles.21 Bioactive glasses
derived by the sol–gel process exhibit high bioactivity and
resorbability because of their macroporous and mesoporous structures.32 In addition to bioactivity and resorbability,
the scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration need to act as a 3D container
of cells in vitro and in vivo. The scaffolds consist of macroporous
structures with an interconnected network, allowing cell migration,
tissue ingrowth, and vascularization.33 By utilizing the scaffolds promoting cell attachment, migration,
and ideally inducing osteogenesis,34 the
engineered bone tissue ready for implantation can be constructed in
vitro. This construct should have mechanical strength mimicking that
of the inherent bone. Considering from our previous study,22−26 SNFs can be highly useful as osteoinductive and biomimetic materials
with high moldability, working not only for the in vitro cell assay
system but also for implantable cell scaffolds for bone defects.

Here, we examined 3D SNFs as a scaffold of MSCs for bone tissue
generation. Culture of MSCs in SNFs is expected to affect their proliferation
and differentiation behaviors through cell–cell and cell–SNF
interactions. The effects of SNFs on the proliferation as well as
the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs were evaluated.

Results
Morphology
of a 3D SNF
To fabricate electrospun fabrics
with an interconnected highly porous microstructure for cell ingrowth,
a 3D SNF was prepared by the sol–gel process.24Figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the SNF. The
designed SNF has an average pore size of 7.6 μm porosity and
an average pore size of 7.6 μm (n = 5). The
diameter of the fibers constituting the SNF was 704 ± 280 nm
(n = 50). Many interconnected pores that may induce
cellular migration and tissue ingrowth were provided by the random
oriented nanofibers, preventing shrinkage during the cell culture
because of the high mechanical strength of the SNF.

image, and (c) SEM image. Scale bars: 10 mm (a), 200 μm (b),
and 30 μm (c).

Mechanical Characteristics of SNFs
The mechanical properties
of SNFs were characterized by the compression test and rheological
analysis. In the compression test (Figure 2a,b), SNFs showed a compressive elastic modulus
of over 1002 ± 85 kPa and a compressive strength of 197 ±
17, respectively. These values are higher than those of porous polystyrene
disks used for the in vitro 3D cell culture. In the rheological analysis
(Figure 2c,d), the
fracture stress and fracture strain were 25.9 ± 8.3 Pa and 0.45
± 0.04%, respectively. Young’s modulus was calculated
as 3.27 ± 0.54 kPa.

Molecular Permeability of SNFs
The
permeation behaviors
of SNFs were investigated using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran
with a molecular weight of 20k. As shown in Figure 3, the time course of permeated FITC-dextran
through an SNF and a culture insert was estimated. The time-dependent
permeation of FITC-dextran through an SNF was observed. The permeation
of FITC through an SNF was rather slower than that of a culture insert
without an SNF. Nevertheless, the obtained result suggested a sufficient
permeability of SNFs for oxygen, minerals, nutrients, and secretions,
which is important for maintaining the cell viability and vitality.

SNF using FITC-dextran (Mn: 20 000)
as the permeant. The amount of FITC-dextran at the equilibrium state
estimated from the volume ratio of inside and outside of the culture
insert was shown.

Adhesion and Proliferation
of MSCs in the 3D SNF
The
adhesion and proliferation of MSCs on the 3D SNF were first examined
using a water-soluble tetrazolium salt-8 (WST-8) assay and compared
with those cultured on traditional 2D tissue culture-treated polystyrene
(TCPS) plates. Figure 4a shows the number of cells adhered on the SNF and TCPS plates at
24 h after seeding. The number of cells adhered on the SNF was smaller
than those on the TCPS plates, especially at a high seeding density.
As can be seen in Figure 4b,c, the cell number of MSCs adhered on the TCPS plates grew
linearly at a high seeding density (5 and 10 × 104 cells/well). In contrast to the cell growth on the TCPS plates,
those seeded on the SNF at any density exponentially grew. The difference
in cell growth was clearly demonstrated by the proliferation rate
of MSCs, estimated on the SNF and TCPS plates from the calculated
relative cell numbers to those at 24 h after seeding (Figure 4d,e). Although the MSCs seeded
on the TCPS plates at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well
detached from the TCPS surface from day 11 to day 14 because of overgrowth
with a high proliferation rate (Figure 4e), the cells cultured in the 3D SNF were quite stable
even after 14 days of culture (Figure 4d). These results suggested that the 3D SNF is suitable
for the stable cell culture with a high proliferation rate, which
is highly demanded in tissue engineering applications.

(square), and 10 (triangle) × 104 cells/well. Data
are shown as the mean ± the standard error of the mean (S. E., n = 2).

Morphologies of MSCs Cultured
in the 3D SNF
The morphologies
of MSCs cultured in the 3D SNF were observed using confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM). The CLSM images of MSCs seeded at 1.5
× 105 cells/well after 7 and 14 days of culture are
shown in Figure 5.
Seven days after seeding, MSCs were detected at a depth of 36.96 μm,
but not at a depth of 66.87 μm (Figure 5b,c). Fourteen days after seeding, the number
of cells at a depth of 36.96 μm was larger than that at 7 days
(Figure 5e), and the
cells were further detected even at a depth of 66.87 μm (Figure 5f). The results suggested
that MSCs vertically migrated and proliferated in SNFs. The CLSM images
of MSCs seeded at 3 × 104 and 3 × 105 cells/well after 7 and 14 days of culture are shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively. Excepting that
MSCs were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/well after 7 days
of culture, the cells were highly stretched and migrated in SNFs.
The thickness of cellular layers seeded at 3 × 104, 1.5, and 3 × 105 cells/well were 8.3, 41, and 45
μm after 7 days and 50, 75, and 87 μm after 14 days, respectively.

(a–c) and 14 days (d–f) after seeding at a cell density

near to the silica fabric surface [1.76 μm, (a,d)], middle [36.96
μm, (b,e)], and near the bottom [66.87 μm, (c,f)] are
shown. Cellular nuclei and skeletons were stained with Hoechst 33342
(blue) and Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (red), respectively. Scale bars:
20 μm.

Osteogenic Differentiation
of MSCs in 3D SNFs
The osteogenic
differentiation behaviors of MSCs in 3D SNFs were then investigated.
After culture in an osteogenic differentiation medium up to 14 days,
the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured by a colorimetric
method using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate.
As shown in Figure 6, the ALP activity of cell cultures in SNFs was already higher than
that on the TCPS plates after 3 days of culture. After 7 days of culture,
the ALP activity in SNFs was much higher than that on the TCPS plates.
The expression of an osteogenic differentiation marker gene, RUNX2, was investigated by real-time polymer chain reaction
(PCR). Under both undifferentiating and differentiating conditions,
the expression of RUNX2 in cells cultured on SNFs
was stronger than those on the TCPS plates (Figure 7a). In addition, the expression of osteocalcin (OCN) in cells cultured on
SNFs tended to be higher than those on the TCPS plates at day 12 (Figure 7b). The osteogenic
differentiation of MSCs was also evaluated by alizarin red s staining.
Although the influence of stratification of cells on microscopic observation
cannot be excluded, after culture in an osteogenic differentiation
medium for 14 days, the cells on SNFs stained more strongly and homogenously
than those on the TCPS plates (Figure 8b,d). The cells on SNFs were stained even in an undifferentiating
condition (Figure 8a), suggesting the essential utility for a tissue-engineered construct,
particularly bone formation. These results were certainly confirmed
by the quantification of alizarin red s staining.

Discussion
In the present study, the proliferation
and osteogenic differentiation
of human bone marrow-derived MSCs in 3D SNFs were investigated. MSCs
seeded on SNFs at any density exponentially grew up to 14 days (Figure 4b), and the proliferation
rate of cells in SNFs was much higher than that on the TCPS plates
(Figure 4d,e). We have
previously demonstrated that the fibroblast cultured in SNFs showed
remarkable proliferation rates compared to the traditional 2D culture.26 The results in this study suggested that MSCs
vertically migrated and proliferated in SNFs without receiving signals
of contact inhibition. In fact, the layer thickness of MSCs in SNFs
after 14 days of culture was over 80 μm, which is much thicker
than that of single layer of cells. This vertical migration of MSCs
to form a 3D cell structure also supported proper cell growth with
high proliferation rate and long-term stability.

After osteogenic
differentiation, the ALP activity of cells on
SNFs increased rapidly and remained high up to 14 days (Figure 6), and their RUNX2 expression was much higher than those on the TCPS plates (Figure 7a). RUNX2 is a transcription factor known as a master switch for the osteogenic
differentiation of MSCs35 and has been
used as a marker gene for the early stage of osteogenic differentiation.36 At day 12, the expression of OCN in cells cultured
on SNFs tended to be higher than those on the TCPS plates at day 12
(Figure 7b). The osteocalcin
protein coded by OCN is a secreted noncollagen matrix protein and
a specific marker gene for the late stage of osteogenesis.37 In some cases, there was no significant difference
in the ALP activity and osteogenic differentiation markers whether
or not bone differentiation was induced. It has been reported that
osteogenic differentiation is induced even in the absence of the differentiation
factor by the high-density culture38 or
in the culture on fibrous scaffolds;39 therefore,
it is possible that a significant difference was hard to be observed
in the presence or absence of induction of bone differentiation. Evaluation
of calcification of MSCs by alizarin red s staining after differentiation
for 14 days (Figure 8) also indicated that SNFs enhanced their osteogenic differentiation.

The osteogenic differentiation of MSCs has been intensively investigated
utilizing scaffolds such as HAp,40 nonwoven
nano- and microfibrous scaffolds of polymers,17−21 or without scaffolds such as spheroid formation.41 Except for soluble factors, factors affecting
the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs are classified into two categories.
The first one is the interaction between cell–cell42 and cell–ECM.43 The 3D nanofibrous structures of SNFs share morphological similarities
to collagen fibrils and enable to promote favorable biological responses
for osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the high interconnectivity
of SNFs allows the cells to interact with the surrounding cells. Another
factor affecting the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is the elasticity
of substrates. The differentiation of MSCs was strongly affected by
the elasticity of substrates and rigid matrices mimicking collagenous
bone prove osteogenic differentiation.44 Silica is a rigid substrate; therefore, it may also contribute to
promote the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.

A compressive
strength of 0.2 MPa was obtained, which is almost
tenth to the standard for a porous ceramic bone implant (2.4 MPa)45 and slightly lower to the compressive strength
of the trabecular bone, which has a compressive strength between 2
and 12 MPa.46 However, it is well-known
that the increase of mechanical properties of scaffolds has been obtained
after tissue formation by in vitro differentiation or tissue growth
after implantation. For example, it was reported that the strength
and elastic modulus of the polymer hydrogel with MSCs were increased
after osteogenic differentiation.47 Furthermore,
new bone formation was observed in hydroxyapatite ceramics throughout
the pore network, and compressive strength was found to increase to
∼30 MPa after 9 weeks of implantation because of tissue ingrowth.
This increase in strength implies that it is not necessary to have
a scaffold with a compressive strength equal to that of bone because
the cell culture on the scaffold in vitro may create a biocomposite,
leading to an increase in the strength.48 Considering these increase effects in the mechanical property, SNFs
seem to be potential materials for implantation. The characterization
of the mechanical properties of SNF scaffolds with MSCs after osteogenic
induction represents a forthcoming challenge.

It is also demonstrated
that SNFs did not show a significant inhibitory
effect on the permeability of the culture insert, which were widely
used in research on cell–cell communication.49 In fact, our previous study suggested that the paracrine
factors secreted from the parenchymal primary hepatocyte placed in
the bottom compartment of the trans-well system and the hepatic nonparenchymal
cell fibroblast placed in the top insert were permeated each other
through SNFs and enhanced functions of hepatocytes in a coculture
system.26 Therefore, the excellent permeability
of SNFs seems to be effective for the osteogenesis of stem cells therein.

Conclusions
In this study, the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation
of bone marrow-derived MSCs on 3D SNFs were investigated. MSCs migrated
vertically inside the SNF, and their growth rate was much higher than
those on the TCPS plates. In regenerative medicine, there is a strong
demand for the expansion of cells collected from patients; therefore,
a high growth rate of cells on SNFs meets the needs. Compared to conventional
2D culture on the TCPS plates, the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs
was strongly promoted on SNFs as confirmed by the ALP activity, RUNX2 expression, and the calcification of MSCs using alizarin
red s staining. Furthermore, an excellent permeability of SNFs was
confirmed by the transport of the dextran polymer with a molecular
weight of 20k through SNFs. The higher permeability of SNFs for oxygen,
minerals, nutrients, and cytokines, which are important for maintaining
the cell viability and vitality, was indicated. These results suggested
that SNFs are essential scaffolds not only for the in vitro cell assay
system but also for the regeneration of bone defects using MSCs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Human serum fibronectin was purchased from
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). All chemicals
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals, Inc., and used without further
purification. The 24-well TCPS plates were obtained from Becton, Dickinson
and Co. (Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Cell Culture
Human
bone marrow-derived MSCs with an
extended life span through retroviral transduction UE7T-13 cells50 were obtained from Japanese Collection of Research
Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank, National Institute of Biomedical Innovation.
The UE7T-13 cells were maintained in a standard D-MEM (Life Technologies
Corp., Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(SAFC Biosciences, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), 100 U/mL of penicillin, and
100 μg/mL of streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, St. Louis,
MO) (D-MEM(+)) at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Preparation of Silica Fiber Nonwoven Fabrics
Tetraethoxysilane
as a metal compound, ethanol as a solvent, water for hydrolysis, and
1 N hydrochloric acid as a catalyst were mixed at a molar ratio of
1:5:2:0.003, refluxed at a temperature of 78 °C for 10 h, followed
by removing a solvent to concentrate, further followed by heating,
thereby a sol solution was formed. Using the resulted sol solution
as a spinning solution, according to a plate-spinning method that
is an electrospinning method, the gel silica fiber webs were prepared.
These SNF cell scaffolds are already commercially available as Cellbed
from Japan Vilene Co. Ltd. The morphologies of SNFs used in this study
were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Miniscope TM3030,
Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV.

Mechanical Characteristic Analysis
The mechanical properties
of SNFs were characterized by the compression test and rheological
analysis using SNFs with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 182
μm. All measurements were performed at 20 °C. In the compression
test, the compressive elastic modulus and compressive strength of
SNFs were tested using a universal tester (Autograph AGS-J; Shimadzu
Corp., Kyoto, Japan) with a 500 N load cell. The samples were axially
compressed at a rate of 0.5 mm/min, and the stress–stain curves
were collected and analyzed using TRPEZIUM X software. The compressive
elastic modulus and compressive strength were determined from the
slope of the stress–strain curves and yield stress, respectively.
As a control, porous polystyrene disks (Alvetex Scaffold 12-well insert,
ReproCELL Inc., Yokohama, Japan) with a diameter of 16 mm, a pore
size of 36–40 μm, a porosity of >90%, and a thickness
of 200 μm were used. Each experiment was performed in duplicate
and shown as the mean ± S. E. In the rheological analysis, strain
sweep rheology experiments were performed on a HAAKE MARS rotational
rheometer (Thermo Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). The SNF was placed
on the bottom stage. Then, a top plate was approached until the load
was monitored to 0.1 N, and the SNF was compressed by the upper plate
at a strain rate of 1 mm/min. Young’s modulus was calculated
as the initial slope of the stress–strain curve in the range
of strain from 0 to 10%. Each experiment was performed in triplicate
and shown as the mean ± S. E.

Permeability Assay
The molecular permeability of SNFs
was investigated using FITC-dextran (Mn: 20 000, Sigma-Aldrich, Co., LLC). Briefly, after the construction
of a trans-well system (12-well plates) filled with 2.9 mL of D-MEM,
the SNF was placed in the top insert. When 100 μL of 1.5 mM
FITC-dextran in the D-MEM was added to the top insert, the experiment
was started. The sample (100 μL) was collected from the medium
in the lower chamber to evaluate the concentration of permeated FITC-dextrans
at each time point. A similar volume of fresh culture medium was added
to the lower chamber after the sample was collected each time to maintain
the volume. The concentration of permeated FITC-dextrans was determined
by the measurement of fluorescence intensity (λex = 494 nm, λem = 518 nm) using a microplate reader.
Permeability was evaluated in % as compared to the total amount of
FITC-dextran added.

Adhesion and Proliferation of MSCs on SNFs
Each well
of 96-well plates with the SNF was pretreated with 70% (v/v) ethanol
and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times in order to prevent
bubbles inside the fabrics. Cells (1, 5, and 10 × 104) dispersed in 100 μL of D-MEM(+) were seeded on each well
of 96-well plates with SNFs and TCPS plates and cultured at 37 °C.
Media were changed every 3 days, and the cells were cultured for 14
days. The cell numbers were measured using a WST-8 assay. A WST-8
premix solution (20 μL of WST-8 working solution (Cell Counting
Kit-8, Dojindo Laboratories, Co. Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan) and 180 μL
of D-MEM(+)) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for
30 min. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader
(Varioskan Flash, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The number of cells
was determined using the absorbance value of a calibration curve for
the known number of cells. Each experiment was performed in duplicate
and shown as the mean ± S. E.

CLSM Observation of MSCs
on SNFs
Cells (3 × 104, 1.5, and 3 ×
105) dispersed in 500 μL
D-MEM(+) were seeded on SNFs set in a 12-well culture insert (Becton,
Dickinson and Co.) and cultured at 37 °C. Media were changed
every 3 days, and the cells were cultured for 7 and 14 days. The cells
were treated with 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Dojindo laboratories)
in D-MEM(+) for an hour under dark condition. Then, the cells were
washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4 wt % paraformaldehyde
solutions in PBS for 20 min, followed by permeation with 0.5% TritonX-100
solution for 2 min. The cells were treated with 1% Alexa Fluor 594
phalloidin (Life Technologies, Corp.) for 2 h. After washing three
times with PBS, the cells were observed by a confocal laser scanning
microscope (LSM-710, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).

Osteogenic
Differentiation of MSCs on SNFs
MSCs (3
× 105) dispersed in 500 μL of D-MEM(+) were
seeded on SNFs set in a 12-well culture insert and precultured for
7 days. MSCs (3 × 104) were seeded on fibronectin-coated
24-well TCPS plates and precultured until the cells reached confluency
(about 3 days). Then, the cell culture medium was changed to the osteogenic
differentiation medium (PromoCell, GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Media
were changed every 3 days, and the cells were cultured for further
14 days. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) for 30 min on ice, and the total protein
concentration was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

ALP Assay
The ALP activity of the
lysate of MSCs with
and without osteogenic induction was measured using a Lab Assay ALP
kit (Wako pure chemicals, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell lysate (20 μL) was added to 6.7 mM of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 100 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.8)
containing 2 mM MgCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 15
min. After the addition of stop solution (200 mM HCl), the absorbance
at 405 nm was measured using a microplate reader and normalized to
the total amount of proteins in each sample lysate. Each experiment
was performed in quadruplicate and shown as the mean ± S. E.

Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted
from cultured cells with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Hilden,
Germany) combined with Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham,
MA). Briefly, the cells were dispersed and homogenized in Trizol using
Powermasher (Nippi, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and biomasher II (Nippi, Inc.),
and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was generated with a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master
Mix with a gDNA Remover (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time reverse transcriptase
(RT)-PCR was performed using the Thunderbird SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo
Co., Ltd.) on an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). The relative quantification was
calculated via the ΔΔCt method
and normalized against the housekeeping GAPDH. The
following primers were used: RUNX2,51 5′-cactggcgctgcaacaaga-3′ (sense) and 5′-catgacagtaaccacagtcccatc-3′
(antisense); OCN,38 5′-ccacatcggctttcaggag-3′
(sense) and 5′-gcaaggggaagaggaaagaag-3′ (antisense);
and GAPDH, 5′-agcaagagcacaagaggaagaga-3′
(sense) and 5′-gaggggagattcagtgtggtg-3′ (antisense).

Alizarin Red Staining
Alizarin red s (2 g; Sigma-Aldrich,
Co., LLC.) was dissolved in 100 mL of ultrapure water, and the pH
of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with NH4OH. The solution
was filtered through 0.22 μm of the poly(vinylidene difluoride)
membrane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). MSCs cultured on SNFs and
TCPS plates in D-MEM(+) and osteogenic differentiation medium for
14 days were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS containing 10% glycerol
for an hour. Then, the cells were stained with an alizarin solution
at room temperature for 5 min and washed two times with PBS. The samples
were observed using microscopy (ECLIPSE LV100, Nikon Corp., Tokyo,
Japan). The intensity of alizarin red staining was quantified using
ImageJ as follows. The individual red, green, and blue channels were
extracted, and the blue channel was subtracted from the red channel.
Then, the intensity of the resultant red channel was quantified.
