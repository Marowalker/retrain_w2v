The
production of chemicals and various materials from black liquor
lignin will greatly improve the economics of biomass refining. In
the present work, organosolv lignin residues (OLRs) from the organosolv
pulping process were used to fabricate submicron lignin spheres using
ethanol/water mixtures as an antisolvent, in conjunction with homogenization.
Both the ethanol content in the ethanol/water mixture and the applications
of homogenization were investigated as key factors affecting the agglomeration
of OLRs. The results show that the solubility of the amphiphilic OLRs
in ethanol was approximately 28 and 32 times greater than those of
alkali lignin and kraft lignin, respectively. Using the optimal percentage
of ethanol together with homogenization enhanced the nucleation of
lignin macromolecules, such that the colloidal spheres of OLR were
spontaneously assembled via gradual hydrophilic–lipophilic
aggregation. The resulting OLR colloidal spheres had a yolk–shell
structure and a mean particle diameter of around 200 nm, when the
ethanol content was 50% and the homogenization time was 15 min or
more. This study demonstrates a simple means of utilizing OLRs to
produce lignin-based spheres. The lignin spheres generated in this
work are thought to have potential applications in many fields as
porous carbon precursors for energy storage, sensitive functional
materials, and controlled-release fertilizer carriers.

Introduction
Lignin is an important
component of plant cell walls and the most
abundant aromatic polymer in nature, accounting for 10–35%
of biomass by weight and up to 40% on an energy basis.1,2 However, most current processes that generate lignin consider this
to be a material part of the waste stream. Only a small percentage
of lignin is used in commercial applications, such as a low-grade
fuel, an additive for pitch, a modification filler in rubber, and
a culture medium for the plant tissue.3−5 Kraft lignin and alkali
lignin are typical industrial lignin products that primarily originate
from the black liquor produced by pulping.6 Approximately, 7 tonnes of black liquor are produced to obtain 1
tonne of pulp. Kraft lignin and alkali lignin have been used for energy
production or commercially applied as additives, binders, dispersants,
and surfactants.7−10 However, the transformation of these industrial lignin products
to value-added materials using a simple process would be extremely
beneficial. Therefore, an efficient and high value-added approach
to utilizing lignin is highly desirable.

Recently, various researchers
have reported the preparation of
nanolignin, colloidal nanospheres, or nanocapsules from kraft or alkaline
lignin, based on the reactions of functional groups, through facile
mechanical or chemical mechanisms.11−18 Nair et al. reported that lignin nanoparticles were obtained from
kraft lignin by high shear homogenization and subsequently used to
improve the thermal stability of lignin/poly(vinyl alcohol) blends.11 Lignin nanoparticles were also produced by Gilca
et al. by sonication of the commercial wheat and grass lignin.15 Nevertheless, the lignin nanoparticles synthesized
by mechanical processing generally have irregular shapes. On account
of this issue, Lievonen et al. developed a simple means of making
kraft lignin nanospheres based on introducing water to a tetrahydrofuran
(THF) phase followed by dialysis.16 Li
et al. also produced lignin nanospheres merely by mixing a kraft lignin/ethanol
solution with water and demonstrated that the ethanol concentration
has a significant effect on the assembly of the nanocapsules.19 These advances have demonstrated new applications
of black liquor lignin and have also challenged the conventional understanding
of lignin morphology.

On the basis of the above studies, it
is apparent that solvents
can play an important role in the formation of nanosphere or nanocapsule
structures. However, the poor solubility of kraft lignin in organic
solvents limits the yield of such processes. For this reason, chemical
modifications such as acetylation, grafting, and cross-linking have
been applied to improve the solubility or to insert functional groups
for further assembly, although such processes are often environmentally
unfriendly.13,14 Thus, there is a need to identify
an ideal feedstock that exhibits good solubility in organic solvents
without modification. This material should also exhibit more reactive
moieties in organic solvents and should be directly used as the raw
material for various nanostructures without any modification.

With the development of organosolv pulping for biorefinery, the
utilization of whole products, especially the by-products, has a crucial
meaning on the environment. The main by-product of the organosolv
biorefinery of biomass is organosolv lignin that is generated in large
quantities by the organosolv pulping process.20 In this process, organic solvents are used to fractionate the lignin
at elevated temperatures, leaving behind holocellulose residues. To
the best of our knowledge, the utilization of organosolv lignin as
building blocks for the assembly of lignin nanostructures has not
been studied in detail. In particular, the effect of the combination
of solvent and mechanical working on the formation of organosolv lignin-based
nanostructures has not yet been reported.

In the present study,
the organosolv lignin residue (OLR) that
is separated from the alcohol-based black liquor was used as a feedstock.
The chemical structure of the OLR was subsequently characterized using
a two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic
resonance (2D HSQC NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy, and ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy.
The molecular weight of the OLR was also determined by using gel permeation
chromatography (GPC). In addition, the submicron lignin spheres were
fabricated by dispersing the OLR in ethanol/water mixtures followed
by homogenization. This work examined both the effects of the ethanol
content in the solvent mixture and the use of homogenization on the
formation of OLR-based colloidal spheres. Transmission electron microscope
(TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to observe the morphology
of the spheres.

Results and Discussion
The yield
of Klason lignin purified from OLR was 14.71%, representing
73.44% of the total lignin (20.03%) in the raw wood (Table 1). This was due to the dissolution
of partial lignin components during the extraction process. The lignin
fractionation result was nearly equal to that (15.53%) reported from
an acidified sodium chlorite process.21 The structural variations of the OLR were characterized using a
2D HSQC NMR spectroscope. As shown in Figure 1, the primary lignin signals appear in the
side-chain region (δC/δH 50–110/2.5–6.0
ppm) and the aromatic region (δC/δH 100–135/5.5–8.0 ppm). The main cross-signals were
assigned according to the literature22,23 and are listed
in Table 2. The cross-signals
that are typical of lignin–carbohydrate complex (LCC) structures
were not observed in the carbohydrate region (δC/δH 91–105/3.9–5.4 ppm), and the cross-signals
of both benzyl ether and xylans disappeared. This result demonstrates
that the primary linkages between xylans and lignins were cleaved
by the alcoholysis and that hemicellulose (the primary component of
the LCC structure) was dissolved during the alcoholysis process. The
liberated lignin was dissolved in ethanol, leading to the fractionation
of the wood lignocellulose. In the aromatic regions, both S2/6 (δC/δH 103.8/6.64 ppm) and G5 (δC/δH 115.4/6.81 ppm)
signals were the primary peaks generated by the poplar wood. The cross-signals
demonstrate that the OLR was mainly composed of syringyl (S)- and
guaiacyl (G)-type lignin units. Condensed cross-signals were also
evident, possibly as a result of the OLR precipitation. In the side-chain
region, in addition to the strong methoxyl group signals (δC/δH 56.1/3.77 ppm), the main signals were
attributed to the condensed lignin structures (δC/δH 60.0/3.69 and 60.5/3.83 ppm), and the signals
of β-β′ structures and small amounts of typical
xylans were also detected. This reveals that the main lignin linkages
of β-O-4′ were cleaved with respect to the milled wood
lignin (MWL) of the raw wood (Figures S1 and S2). These results demonstrate that the lignin condensation occurred
during the precipitation of the OLR. The obtained OLR was rich in
carbon-to-carbon bonds, with a small amount of carbohydrates.

The weight-average (Mw) and the number-average
molecular weights (Mn) of the OLR as determined
by GPC were 6708 and 3011 g mol–1, respectively,
and so, the polydispersity index (PDI) was 2.23. This PDI suggests
that the OLR has a narrow particle size distribution. After the homogenization
process in 50% ethanol for 45 min, Mw and Mn were slightly decreased to 6672 and 2570 g
mol–1. This reveals that the homogenization process
affected little on the molecular weights of OLR. Owing to the hydrophobic
nature of lignin and the hydrophilic characteristics of carbohydrates,
the OLR represents a polymer with amphiphilic properties. This is
beneficial with regard to its eventual application as a building block
for the assembly of various structures.24

When considering the self-assembly of lignin nano- or microstructures,
the yield of the product is directly related to the solubility of
lignin in the solvent. The solubilities of OLR, kraft lignin, and
alkali lignin in ethanol were assessed in this study and were found
to be 2.15, 0.066, and 0.077 wt %, respectively. The solubility of
OLR was, therefore, approximately 32 and 28 times those of the kraft
lignin and alkali lignin. This difference was deemed to result from
the degree of fractionation of OLR and to have an impact on its functional
groups during the organosolv process.25 Typically, lignin is extracted by organic solvents owing to the
high solubility of this material and is readily recovered by evaporation
of the solvent. Thus, the OLR obtained in this study is considered
to represent an ideal feedstock for studying the effects of granulating
with ethanol/water mixtures, followed by homogenization.

TEM
was used to observe the morphology of OLR aggregates resulting
from different ethanol/water ratios and the morphologic variations
after homogenization. As shown in Figure 2, the OLR in pure water displayed no definite
shape (Figure 2a).
However, in an aqueous solution with 25% ethanol, the OLR aggregated
to form colloidal particles with irregular shapes (Figure 2b). As the ethanol content
was increased to 50%, the OLR aggregates transitioned into spheres
with sizes in the range of 100–250 nm (Figure 2c). At 75% ethanol, the OLR was present primarily
as uniform colloidal spheres with sizes close to 150 nm, except for
some zonally interconnected clusters of spheres (Figure 2d). This occurred because,
after the addition of ethanol, the hydrophilic moieties of OLR had
an affinity to ethanol, leaving the hydrophobic portions of the dissociated
lignin aggregating together to form the spheres.13,19,24 However, because the hydrophilic moieties
were distributed randomly in the OLR, abundant hydrophilic moieties
would expose to ethanol constantly during the homogenization process.
Therefore, regular OLR-based spheres were obtained using the optimal
percentage of ethanol together with the homogenization process (Figure S3).

Figure 2 TEM images show the morphological differences
of the OLR aggregates
in the ethanol/water solution with an ethanol content of (a) 0, (b)
25, (c) 50, and (d) 75%, in conjunction with a homogenization treatment
of 15 min.

Figure 3 presents
the morphological differences between the OLR aggregates assembled
in a 50% ethanol solution as the homogenization time is varied. The
OLR aggregates appeared to be composed of globular clusters but presented
no particular morphology before homogenization (Figure 3a). After homogenization for 5 min, the OLR
aggregates gradually changed to almost spherical structures with a
yolk–shell construction having diameters within the range of
200–300 nm (Figure 3b). Following 15 min of continuous homogenization, independent
OLR-based colloidal spheres were found with sizes of approximately
230–250 nm (Figure 3c). Increasing the homogenization time to 45 min generated
more spherical OLR-based submicron spheres with sizes within the range
of 170–260 nm, but the yolk–shell construction was not
apparent yet (Figure 3d). These OLR-based submicron spheres were found to be uniformly
distributed based on the AFM images (Figure 4). The above results indicate that both the
ethanol content and the homogenization time play important roles in
forming the OLR-based submicron spheres. Low ethanol content tends
to prevent the formation of a spherical morphology, whereas longer
homogenization time promotes the production and the densification
of the spheres.

ethanol/water solution

of (a) 0, (b) 5, (c) 15, and (d) 45 min, respectively. The scale bar
in the insets is 100 nm.

Figure 4 AFM images of the OLR-based submicron spheres regenerated from
the ethanol/water solution (ethanol content: 50%), in conjunction
with a 45 min homogenization.

The functional groups of the OLR and the OLR-based spheres
were
characterized by FTIR analysis (Figure 5). The spectra exhibit a peak at 3410 cm–1 that corresponds to hydroxyl groups. Compared with the peak position
(3334 cm–1) of wood lignocellulose, the hydroxyl
peak of the OLR exhibits a blue shift. This is attributed to the exposure
of a greater quantity of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the lignin following
the removal of cellulose and hemicellulose.25 The peak at 2934 cm–1 corresponds to the asymmetric
stretching vibrations of methoxy, methyl, and methylene groups. The
peaks at 1593 and 1506 cm–1 are attributed to the
skeletal vibrations of benzene and carbonyl stretching, respectively,
and are more intense in the lignin spectra than in the wood spectra.
The peaks at 1456 and 1267 cm–1 are ascribed to
C–H bending and benzene or C=O stretching vibrations
and are present in the spectra of OLR but not the wood. The spectra
of the OLR and the OLR-based spheres are all similar. This result
indicates that neither the variations in the ratio of the ethanol/water
mixture nor the homogenization time had a distinct influence on the
functional groups or basic structure of the OLR-based spheres.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra
of the wood, OLR, and OLR-based spheres generated
from the ethanol/water solution (ethanol content: 25 and 50%, respectively),
in conjunction with a 45 min homogenization.

The UV–vis spectra of the OLR-based spheres that regenerated
from 50% ethanol/water solution contain three main absorption bands
(Figure 6). The first
one is located at 207 nm, corresponding to the E band of the π–π*
transitions of the OLR. The second and third ones are located at 235
and 276 nm and are attributed to the B band of the π–π*
transition of the aromatic groups.24,26 There is essentially
no change in these bands before and after homogenization, demonstrating
that this processing has little effect on the chemical composition
and bonding of the OLR and OLR-based spheres. According to the FTIR
and UV–vis spectra, the characteristic peaks indicate that
the functional groups and the chemical structure belonging to lignin
remained unchanged when the homogenization time varied from 0 to 45
min and the ethanol content varied from 0 to 50%. The stability of
the OLR structure laid the foundation for the formation of micellar
submicron spheres.

Figure 6 UV–vis spectroscopy of the OLR and OLR-based spheres
generated
from the ethanol/water solution (ethanol content: 50%), in conjunction
with a homogenization for 5, 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively.

To improve our understanding of
the formation of the OLR-based
colloidal spheres, possible mechanisms were investigated based on
the above results. From the 2D HSQC NMR analysis, the ether bonds
mostly disappeared, and the carbon-to-carbon bonds were richly distributed
in the OLR, linking with a small amount of hemicelluloses. Therefore,
the OLR with hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and having a 3D
structure was considered as building blocks. Both the hydroxyl groups
and the newly formed carboxyl groups in the OLR molecules were expected
to act as hydrophilic sites and distributed randomly in the complicated
structure of OLR, whereas the aliphatic groups and aromatic skeletons
were hydrophobic. When being added into the water/ethanol solution,
the hydrophilic parts of the OLR molecules prompted their affinity
to ethanol, whereas the hydrophobic parts of the OLR molecules promoted
the formation of electrical double layers, forming the dispersion
of stable spheres in the water/ethanol solution.19,24 Thus, the hydrophobic regions tend to aggregate to form the yolks
of the colloidal spheres, with the regenerated dissociation lignin
parts forming the shells (Figure 7). This process is simultaneously facilitated by both
van der Waals and π–π interactions. The OLR aggregates
are likely to form larger spheres or agglomeration when the ethanol
content is insufficient to dissociate all hydrophobic parts, and the
homogenization is not enough to destroy the intermolecular structure.
If the ethanol content is high enough to dissociate most of the hydrophobic
sections, then the OLR aggregates will not form cores and the balance
between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in solution will be
disrupted. Therefore, to solve the agglomeration of the submicron
lignin spheres, the ethanol content and the homogenizing time are
improved to 50% and 45 min. In this case, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic
parts facilitated by both van der Waals and π–π
interactions will form the shells and yolks of the colloidal spheres,
respectively. Furthermore, the high shear force applied during homogenization
can promote the formation of spheres at the same time, and the hydrophobic
parts are compacted to produce submicron or smaller spheres. These
OLR-based spheres exhibit high specific surface areas and good reactivity
because of the destruction of interunit linkages and the generation
of multiple functional groups. The OLR-based spheres show a significant
potential as precursors that may have applications to energy storage,
drug delivery, and templated syntheses.18,27−31

OLR-based submicron spheres.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates an approach to fabricate
the OLR-based
spheres using differing ratios of ethanol/water combined with a homogenization
process. The OLR extracted from the wood was found to contain amphiphilic
portions and showed a higher solubility in ethanol than those of alkali
lignin and kraft lignin. As a result, the hydrophobic parts of the
material aggregated into spherical cores in the ethanol/water solution,
whereas the hydrophilic regions formed shells through the van der
Waals interactions of the aliphatic groups and the π–π
interactions of the aromatic groups. The morphology and the size of
the OLR-based spheres were significantly affected by the ethanol content.
The homogenization treatment was also found to facilitate the densification
of the OLR assemblies through the application of a high shear force,
and this processing had no effects on the stability of the chemical
components or bonds in the OLR-based submicron spheres.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Poplar wood (Populus ussuriensis Kom.) powder was used as a feedstock for the extraction of OLR.
Ethanol, sulfuric acid, alkali lignin, and kraft lignin used in this
work were of analytical grade and were purchased from the Kermel Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).

Extraction and Purification
of OLR
The OLR was separated
from the black liquor of the acid-catalyzed ethanol pulping of wood.
In this process, a Teflon-lined stainless steel reactor (100 mL) was
used as the experiment container. Poplar wood powder (6.0 g) was used
as the raw material, and 75% (v/v) ethanol solution was employed as
the solvent, with 0.12% (w/w, percentage of oven dry wood) H2SO4 added as a catalyst. The solid/liquid ratio in the
reaction mixtures was 1:10 (g/mL), and each reaction was carried out
at 180 °C over 80 min. The black liquor generated in the reactor
was subsequently passed through a 0.45 μm filter, and the filtrate
was collected. The solid residue was washed three times with an ethanol
solution of 75% (v/v), and the washings were added to the filtrate.
Finally, a volume of distilled water equal to three times the total
filtrate volume was added to the filtrate to precipitate the OLR.
The OLR was purified by an acid hydrolysis method. The OLR (0.3308
g) was added to 72% H2SO4 (5 mL) with vigorous
stirring at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the suspension was diluted
with distilled water to 3% sulfuric acid and refluxed continuously
for 4 h. The purified organosolv lignin was separated by filtering
and washed with distilled water.

Solubility of OLR, Kraft
Lignin, and Alkali Lignin in Ethyl
Alcohol
Excess amounts of OLR, alkali lignin, and kraft lignin
were separately dispersed in 10 mL of ethanol and subjected to ultrasonication
for 20 min. The mixtures were subsequently filtered through a 0.45
μm nylon membrane. The solubility of each material was calculated
by determining the mass fraction of the saturated lignin solution.

Assembly of OLR into Spheres
A 0.3 g OLR sample was
dissolved in 100 mL of the ethanol/water solution overnight, with
magnetic stirring. According to the volume ratio of ethanol/water,
the trials were divided into three groups that have different ethanol
contents: 0% ethanol content, 25% ethanol content, 50% ethanol content,
and 75% ethanol content. Typically, the OLR in the 50% ethanol solution
was processed using a homogenizer (APV-2000, SPW Corp., Charlotte,
USA) for 5, 15, 30, or 45 min. The homogenizer was set at an operating
pressure of 100 bars for homogenizing valve 1 and 450 bars for homogenizing
valve 2.

Characterization
OLR Yield
The Klason lignin yield
was determined according
to TAPPI Standards T 222 om-88,20 and the
OLR yield was expressed as the wt % of Klason lignin. Each sample
was analyzed a minimum of three times, and the average values were
reported.

1H–13C Correlation
2D HSQC NMR
Spectroscopy
In the preparation of NMR studies, a 90 mg sample
of OLR was dissolved in 0.5 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). The 2D HSQC NMR spectra were recorded on
an Agilent ProPulse 500 MHz spectrometer (Agilent Tech., Santa Clara,
USA) and recorded in the gradient HSQC adiabatic mode. The spectral
widths were 20 000 and 5000 Hz for the 13C and 1H dimensions, respectively. A total of 1024 complex points
were collected for the 1H dimension, with a recycle delay
of 1.5 s and 128 transients, whereas 256 time increments were recorded
in the 13C dimension. Before Fourier transformation, the
data matrices were zero-filled to 1024 points in the 13C dimension.

GPC Analysis
A 0.4 g OLR or the
OLR after homogenization
for 45 min was acetylated in 10 mL of an acetylation reagent (consisting
of 23.48 mL of acetic anhydride, 20.24 mL of pyridine, and 21.3 mL
of dioxane) to improve the solubility of the lignin in THF. The molecular
weight of the lignin was subsequently ascertained based on GPC using
an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatograph (Agilent Tech.,
Wilmington, USA) equipped with a HP 1100 variable wavelength detector
and a 2128 fraction collector (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), employing
THF as the eluant at 1.0 mL min–1. Polystyrene was
employed as the standard substance to calibrate the instrument.

FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra were recorded using
a Nicolet 6700 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) in the
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode, from 600 to 4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

UV–Vis
Spectroscopy
A Cary 100 spectrometer
(Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) was utilized to determine the functional
groups of the OLR in the ethanol/water solution before and after homogenization,
over the wavelength range of 190–800 nm. The OLR concentration
in these samples was approximately 0.3% (w/w).

TEM Observations
TEM observations were made using a
JEM-2100 microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. The samples in solution were first dropped onto a copper
grid coated with a carbon film and then air-dried for 3 min to allow
ethanol and water to evaporate.

AFM Analyses
AFM
observations were made with a Pico
Plus instrument (Agilent Tech., Tempe, USA). The AFM samples were
prepared by slowly dispersing the OLR spherical colloids on a quartz
slide, followed by drying at room temperature for 24 h.
