Here, we report multistacked organic
photodiodes (OPDs) for potential light-fidelity (Li-Fi) detectors
in visible light communications. The multistacked detectors were fabricated
by integrating semitransparent inverted-type OPDs with polymer:nonfullerene
bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layers. The thickness of BHJ sensing layers
in the inverted-type OPDs was controlled to 30, 60, and 100 nm for
top, middle, and bottom cells in the multistacked detectors, respectively,
while 30 nm thick metal (silver) electrodes were used for securing
both electrical conductivity and optical transparency. Results showed
that each OPD cell in the multistacked detectors could deliver exact
current signals upon illumination with a modulated white light from
inorganic light-emitting diode lamp. The current signal from each
OPD cell was linearly decreased as the modulation frequency of white
light increased, supporting a stable operation of the multistacked
detectors. Finally, the present multistacked detectors were able to
exactly detect the programmed Li-Fi signals with a particular digitized
information.

Introduction
Visible light communication
(VLC) has been spotlighted because the VLC-based light fidelity (Li-Fi)
technology can exploit common lightings (lamps) as a signaling means
with a faster communication speed than conventional radio frequency-based
wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) technology.1−3 In particular, the Li-Fi
signals can be stably communicated in various harsh environments with
electromagnetic interferences such as autonomous cars, aircrafts,
robot systems, hospitals, and so forth.4,5 Recently, the
VLC-based Li-Fi technology has been more viable because of wide spreading
of durable inorganic light-emitting diode (LED) lightings, which enable
stable signaling for data transmission.6−8 It has been demonstrated
that the data transmission at 500 Mbps is possible by employing the
LED light sources, and the VLC location-based services could provide
a positioning accuracy of 30 cm.9−11 These early efforts have proven
the capability of Li-Fi technology in a variety of advanced applications
such as autonomous cars, drones, humanoid robots, and so forth.

In terms of detectors for the VLC-based Li-Fi systems, inorganic
photodiodes have been typically used to receive visible light signals
from LED lightings with controlled frequencies.12−17 Basically, inorganic photodiodes have the benefit of high stability
but their demerits include rigid shapes without reasonable bendability/flexibility
and high-temperature processes leading to the limited sizes of detectors.18,19 In particular, the recent paradigm shift by the fourth industrial
revolution requires sophisticated multisensing detectors with various
application shapes for advanced Li-Fi systems featuring big data transmission
capability.20−22

On this account, organic photodiodes (OPDs)
are considered one of the best candidates for optical detectors in
advanced Li-Fi systems because they feature high sensitivity via efficient
charge separation (or photomultiplication) and can work well with
organic semiconducting nanolayers of which thickness is far less than
100 nm so as to achieve high flexibility and optical transparency.23−30 In particular, OPDs based on semiconducting polymers and/or soluble
small molecules can be fabricated by wet-coating methods using liquid
solutions at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which deliver
huge design freedoms for large-area manufacturing processes.31,32 However, less attention has been so far paid to OPDs for the applications
of the VLC-based Li-Fi detectors. Moreover, no attempt has been reported
on the concept of integrated Li-Fi detectors with multistacked OPDs,
even though this idea is expected to enhance the capacity of data
transmission via multiplied data-receiving logics in the recent big
data era.

In this work, we have attempted to integrate three
OPDs with different optical transparency each other and examined their
sensing characteristics for modulated visible light signals from a
LED lamp. The inverted-type OPDs were fabricated by employing polymer:nonfullerene
type bulk heterojunction (BHJ) sensing layers, which consist of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))]
(PBDB-T) and 3,9-bis(6-methyl-2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) (IT-M) as an electron donor and electron acceptor,
respectively. The optical transparency of OPDs was controlled by adjusting
the thickness of the BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M) layers, while the semitransparent
metal electrodes were used for the fabrication of multistacked detectors.33−36 Results showed that each OPD cell in the multistacked OPD detectors
could sensitively sense the modulated white light even at a reduced
light intensity and exhibited excellent detection performance for
the programmed light with a particular information.

Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1a, the multistacked OPDs were fabricated by integrating three single
inverted-type OPD cells with different thicknesses of BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M)
sensing layers. Considering the optical transmission of white light
from the LED lamp, the thinnest BHJ layers (t = 30
nm) were applied for top devices and the 60 nm and 100 nm thick BHJ
layers were used for middle and bottom OPD cells (see the film color
in Figure 1b left).
Note that the thickness of Ag electrodes was fixed to ca. 30 nm for
securing the light transmission from top to bottom OPD cells but keeping
the electrical conductivity as an electrode. The modulated (pulsed)
white light from the LED lamp was first incident to the top OPD cells
and then reached the bottom cells through the middle cells (see the
relative degree of optical transparency for each OPD cell in Figure 1b right). During
sensing operation, both photocurrent density and photovoltage for
individual OPD cells were measured at the same time for achieving
simultaneous processes of one-light source and three-detectors.

with three OPD cells. The thickness of the BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M) layers

middle, and bottom OPD cells, respectively. (b) Photographs for the
BHJ films (left) and OPDs (right) according to the BHJ thickness.

The optical absorption characteristics
of individual devices (cells), which are composed of the semitransparent
30 nm thick Ag electrodes, were measured as displayed in Figure 2a. Comparing the
optical absorption spectra of devices with the light emission spectrum
of the LED lamp, the present three OPD cells are considered to be
capable of sensing most parts of visible light from the LED lamp.
Here, it is noted from the optical transmittance spectra in Figure S1 that the visible light component from
the LED lamp could sufficiently pass through the Ag electrode (transparency
= 56% at 600 nm) and the top (transparency = 67% at 600 nm) and middle
(transparency = 64% at 600 nm) cells and reach the bottom cells in
the multistacked device geometry. As shown in Figure 2b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE)
spectra disclosed that the present three OPDs could detect visible
light from the LED lamp up to ca. 750 nm, even though the shape of
EQE spectra was slightly different from that of optical absorption
spectra. The top OPDs with the 30 nm thick BHJ layers exhibited the
lowest EQE, whereas the highest EQE values were measured for the bottom
OPDs with the 100 nm thick BHJ layers. This result can be ascribed
to the reduced number of excitons generated in the case of the thinner
BHJ layers, compared with the thicker BHJ layers, because of relatively
insufficient volume for the maximized absorption of incident photons
in the thinner BHJ layers, if the charge separation yield was identical
for both cases.

films according to the film thickness (note that the electroluminescence
spectrum of the white LED lamp is included for comparison). (b) EQE
spectra for individual OPDs with the PBDB-T:IT-M layers.

Next, the dependence of light intensity was examined
for individual OPDs because the white light intensity from the LED
lamp can be varied with respect to the position of OPDs in the communication
rooms. As shown in Figure 3a, the JPH–VAPP curves of devices were noticeably changed with the
incident intensity of white light (PIN). Here, it is worthy to note that both photocurrent and photovoltage
were clearly measured even at the lowest light intensity (PIN = 8.8 mW/cm2). The photocurrent
density (JPH) at zero applied voltage
(VAPP = 0 V), which corresponds to short
circuit current density, was 0.59 (53.1), 0.79 (71.1), and 0.87 mA/cm2 (78.3 μA) at PIN = 8.8
mW/cm2 for the top, middle, and bottom OPDs, respectively
(see Figure 3b left).
As the applied voltage changed to VAPP = −0.5 V, the photocurrent density was slightly increased
to 0.92 (83), 1.17 (105), and 1.30 mA/cm2 (117 μA)
at PIN = 8.8 mW/cm2 for the
top, middle, and bottom OPDs, respectively (see Figure 3b right). This can be explained by the accelerated
charge transport due to the enhanced band bending at the negative
bias condition (see Figure S2). The similar
trend was measured for other PIN cases,
but no flip in the JPH trend was observed
for the present three OPDs. Therefore, the present multistacked detectors
with single OPDs can be operated and deliver stable signals even at
negative bias conditions down to −0.5 V. Interestingly, as
shown in Figure 3c,
the photovoltage (VPH) trend was slightly
different from the photocurrent trend because it was very lower for
the top OPDs than the middle and bottom OPDs at PIN = 8.8 mW/cm2. This result can be attributable
to the reason that the photovoltage could not be sufficiently achieved
owing to the insufficient number of charges generated at the lowest PIN in the case of the top OPDs with the thinnest
BHJ layers (see Figure 3d).

individual OPDs with the PBDB-T:IT-M layers according to the varied
incident light intensity of LED lamp. (b) Photocurrent density (JPH) as a function of incident light intensity

(VAPP) of 0 V (left) and 0.5 V (right).

photocurrent density (JPH) and photovoltage

photo-sensing performances of individual OPDs at different PIN conditions.

On the basis of the static characteristics investigated above,
the dynamic sensing performances of the three different OPDs were
measured by varying the frequency (fIN) of white light from the LED lamp. As shown in Figure 4, the photocurrent (IPH) at VAPP = 0
V was successfully measured for all devices even though the white
light frequency was increased from 6 to 15 Hz. In addition, the photocurrent
change could be exactly measured even at the lowest light intensity
(PIN = 8.8 mW/cm2). Further
analysis disclosed that as the white light frequency increased, the
photocurrent was gradually decreased irrespective of the incident
light intensity (see Figure 5a). This trend can be explained by the more reduced number
of photons passed through the optical chopper at the higher rotation
speed. As plotted in Figure 5b, the photocurrent increase was in accordance with the light
intensity without respect to the light frequency as well as the thickness
of the BHJ layers.

BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M) layers upon the varied frequency (fIN) of white light from the LED lamp. The thickness (t) of the BHJ layers is given on the left top: (a) t = 30 nm, (b) t = 60 nm, and (c) t = 100 nm. The incident light intensity is marked on the
light part of each graph.

the BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M) layers: (a) photocurrent as a function of the
frequency (fIN) of white light from the
LED lamp at a fixed incident light intensity (PIN), (b) photocurrent as a function of incident light intensity
(PIN) at the fixed frequency (fIN) of white light from the LED lamp. The thickness
(t) of the BHJ layers is given on each graph.

After evaluating the dynamic sensing
performances of individual OPDs, the multistacked devices were subjected
to the dynamic test by employing the same fIN and PIN conditions. Here, it is noted
that the incident light intensity was gradually decreased for the
middle and bottom OPD cells because of the stepwise optical absorption
loss by the presence of the top and middle devices, respectively.
As shown in Figure 6, all the three OPD cells in the multistacked devices exhibited clear
photocurrent signals while the light frequency was dynamically changed
from 6 to 15 Hz. The photocurrent change according to the light frequency
was well maintained for all three OPD cells, even though the incident
light intensity was decreased gradually. However, the photocurrent
was noticeably reduced for the middle and bottom OPD cells owing to
the decreased light intensity by the top and middle cells, respectively.
To further understand the reduced photocurrent trend, the photocurrent
at VAPP = 0 V was plotted as a function
of fIN. Here, it is noted that the rise
and decay slopes for signals were almost identical even though the
incident intensity was varied (see Figure S3). As displayed in Figure 7a, the photocurrent was almost linearly decreased as the frequency
increased. Although the incident light intensity of bottom cell was
lower than top and middle cells, the trend of photocurrent change
was similar. This linear relationship is advantageous for the prediction
of photocurrent signals at much higher frequencies as demonstrated
in Figure S4. The similar approach can
be applied to predict the photocurrent according to the modulated
light intensity when it comes to the linear relation between photocurrent
and light intensity (see Figure 7b). In addition, the present study informs that the
photocurrent measured by each OPD cell is subjected to gradual reduction
when the pulse width of white light becomes narrow via high-frequency
modulation processes of white light from LED lamps (see Figure S5).

Figure 6 Photocurrent responses of multistacked
detectors with three individual OPDs upon the varied frequency (fIN) of white light from the LED lamp. The incident
light intensity is marked on the light part of each graph. Note that
the photocurrent signals were individually measured from each OPD
cell in the multistacked detectors.

detectors with three individual OPD cells (TC: top cell, MC: middle
cell, BC: bottom cell): (a) photocurrent as a function of the frequency
(fIN) of white light from the LED lamp
at a fixed incident light intensity (PIN), (b) photocurrent as a function of incident light intensity (PIN) at the fixed frequency (fIN) of white light from the LED lamp.

Finally, the multistacked detectors were tested whether each
OPD cell is able to deliver correct current signals upon illumination
with a programmed LED light. When the programmed LED light with the
information of “KNU” was incident to the multistacked
detectors, all the three cells in the multistacked detectors could
obviously output current signals without respect to the incident programmed
light intensity (see Figures 8 and S7). The pattern of current
signals was almost in good agreement with that of the incident light
signals from the LED lamp, while the intensity of current signals
was different from each other owing to the changed light intensity
for the three OPD cells. In addition, as shown in Figure S6, the photocurrent signals from each OPD cell were
well synchronized with time. Here, it is noted that each OPD cell
in the multistacked detectors can sense different light signals (different
information) by combining time-dependent light pulse modulations with
current sensing synchronization processes.34

detectors integrated with three OPD cells upon illumination with the
programmed LED light: (a) incident white light pulse pattern with
“KNU” information, (b) current signals measured by each
OPD cell in the multistacked detectors. Note that the pulse width
was controlled as wide as 28 s to make clear patterns in the present
experiment but it can be extremely reduced down to microscale in the
practical (commercialization) stage by employing sophisticated electronic
circuits for the control of LED lamp.

Conclusions
Multistacked detectors for potential VLC-based
Li-Fi communications were fabricated by integrating individual semitransparent
OPD cells with three different thicknesses of BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M) sensing
layers. The optical transparency of top and middle cells reached 67
and 64% at 600 nm, respectively. The EQE trend of the OPD cells was
inversed to that of optical transparency. All semitransparent OPDs
showed a linear relationship between photocurrent and LED light intensity,
whereas the photovoltage was considerably lowered for the OPDs with
the thinnest (30 nm thick) BHJ layers. The dynamic sensing experiments
disclosed that the individual semitransparent OPDs could sensitively
detect the modulated white light from the LED lamp and showed a linearly
reduced photocurrent with the increased frequency of white light.
All three OPD cells in the multistacked OPDs exhibited stable sensing
performances for the pulsed white light signals, even though the incoming
light intensity was gradually decreased for the middle and bottom
cells. The programmed white light from the LED lamp could be precisely
detected by each OPD cell in the multistacked detectors. Hence, it
is expected that the present multistacked OPD technology could contribute
to maximize the sensing capability of programmed light signals in
the Li-Fi communications.

Experimental Section
Materials and Solutions
PBDB-T (weight-average molecular weight = 18 kDa; polydispersity
index = 2.5) and IT-M (formula weight = 1.455 kDa) were purchased
from Solarmer (USA). For the preparation of zinc oxide (ZnO) electron-collecting
buffer layers, zinc acetate dehydrate (purity > 99%) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Blend solutions of PBDB-T and IT-M were
prepared using chlorobenzene (CB) solvent in the presence of 1,8-diiodooctane
(1.0 vol %) as an additive (concentration = 20 mg/mL, PBDB-T:IT-M
= 1:1 by weight). These solutions were subjected to vigorous stirring
for well mixing at room temperature for 3 days prior to spin-coating.
For preparation ZnO precursors, zinc acetate dehydrate (100 mg) was
dissolved in the liquid mixture of 2-methoxyethanol (1 mL) and ethanol
amine (0.028 mL, stabilizer) and then two-step stirring process was
carried out at 60 °C for 3 h and at room temperature for 12 h.

Thin Film and Device Fabrication
For the fabrication of
OPD detectors, indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates were
subjected to photolithography processes, followed by wet cleaning
using acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Then, the wet-cleaned ITO–glass
substrates were exposed to a UV–ozone (UVO) environment for
20 min. On top of the UVO-treated ITO–glass substrates, the
ZnO precursor solutions were spun and thermally annealed at 200 °C
for 1 h in air ambient condition. Next, the BHJ (PBDB-T:IT-M) layers
were spin-coated on the annealed ZnO layers using a spin-coater equipped
inside a glove box (nitrogen environment). The thickness of the BHJ
layers were controlled to be 30, 60, and 100 nm by adjusting the concentration
of the PBDB-T:IT-M solutions. The BHJ-coated samples were moved into
a vacuum chamber system in an argon-charged glove box, followed by
depositing molybdenum oxide (MoO3, 10 nm) and silver (Ag,
30 nm, 18 Ω) electrodes at a base pressure of ∼1.0 ×
10–6 Torr. The fabricated OPDs showed different
transparency owing to the varied thickness of the BHJ layers. To complete
the multistacked detectors, the top cell was physically stacked on
the middle cell that was physically stacked on the bottom cell using
a precise aligning zig system (see Figure 1a). The stacked detectors with the three
OPD cells became a vertically integrated module but each OPD cell
has individual electrodes so as to deliver isolated output signals
(current and voltage).

Measurements
A surface profiler
(DektakXT-E, Bruker) was used for the measurement of film thickness.
The optical absorption spectra of films and electrodes were measured
using a UV–visible spectrometer (Lambda 750, PerkinElmer),
whereas the optical transparency of devices was examined with an optical
microscope (SV-55, SOMETECH). The photocurrent density—applied
voltage (JPH–VAPP) curves of OPDs were measured using a home-built photodiode
measurement system equipped with an electrometer (Keithley 2400) and
a LED lamp (72007, Philips). The incident light intensity of LED lamp
was controlled by adjusting the input electrical power and calibrated
using a certified photodiode (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki, Japan). The EQE
spectra of OPDs were measured using a home-built EQE measurement system
in which a monochromator (CM110, Spectral Products) was attached to
a Tungsten-Halogen lamp (150 W, ASBN-W, Spectral Products). The pulsed
white light was generated by modulating the speed of optical choppers,
enabling the LED frequency to range from 6 to 15 Hz.
