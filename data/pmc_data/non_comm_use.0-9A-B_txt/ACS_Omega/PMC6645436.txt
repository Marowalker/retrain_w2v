A family
of different substituents aza(oxazoline) ligand-based
zinc and magnesium complexes were synthesized. These complexes can
catalyze ring opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL)
and lactide (LA) to produce poly-ε-caprolactone and polylactide
with good conversions. Polymerization studies showed that the zinc
complexes 1a–4a had moderate activity
toward LA and ε-CL polymerization. In situ IR spectroscopy research
of zinc complexes showed that the N-donor group-substituted complexes
had higher activity than that of the O-ether donor group. The substituted
analogies and the flexibility of the amino backbone had a distinct
influence on the activity of LA and ε-CL polymerization. The
alternates of zinc with magnesium produced complexes 5a–8a, which achieved an obviously increased polymerization
activity. Among these magnesium complexes, 7a showed
the highest activity in the polymerization of LA. At [M]/[cat] = 1000,
the reaction progress was stabilized in 5 min with up to 97% conversion
of a monomer at ambient temperature.

Introduction
As a tremendous development
in the petroleum industry, the polymers
produced from petrochemicals have accessed to a wide range of applications.
As petroleum resources could not be renewed and because of the continuous
pollution of petrochemical-based plastic products to the environment,
biodegradable polymers were widely investigated as substitutes.1,2 Polylactide (PLA) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) were widely
researched as biodegradable polymers which had applications in many
fields such as textiles, packaging films, tissue engineering, and
drug delivery.3−8 The ring opening polymerization (ROP) of lactide (LA) and ε-caprolactone
(ε-CL) was the universal method to produce PLA and PCL. The
microstructures of the polymer had a significant effect ranging from
the mechanical to degradation properties of PLA.9−12 Further application of PLA and
PCL materials depended on the polymer properties and costs. The development
of a high activity catalytic system for polymerization of LA and ε-CL
could obviously decrease production costs of polymer and promote its
commercialization.13,14

The metal complexes which
contained an organic ligand with a metal
atom were one of very successful catalytic systems for the polymerization
of LA and ε-CL. Many of the metal complexes such as alkali metals,15−17 Mg,18−21 Y,22 Ti,23,24 Zn,25−36 Al37−40 and rare earth metals41−43 were researched, some of these
complexes had exhibited outstanding performance in ROP of LA and ε-CL.
In these metal-based catalysts, zinc and magnesium complexes as catalysts/initiators
for the preparation of PLA and PCL had attracted widespread attention.
Zinc/magnesium-based complexes were excellent catalysts in the polymerization
of LA and ε-CL due to low toxicity, outstanding activity, and
biocompatibility. Recently, Lin and co-workers reported a series of
dimeric zinc complexes based on the [NNO]-tridentate ligand, they
showed high activity toward the preparation of PLA and PCL.30 The Du group reported a family of chiral zinc
amido-oxazolinate catalyst, which showed high activity and isoselectivity
towards the polymerization of rac-lactide (rac-LA).44 Cui and co-workers
demonstrated a series of achiral heteroscorpionate zwitterionic zinc
complexes, which showed high activity and isoselectivity towards the
polymerization of rac-LA.45 Ma and co-workers also reported zinc silylamido complexes bearing
an oxazolinyl or benzoxazolyl aminophenolate ligand. All of these
complexes showed good activity for LA ROP under immortal solvent-free
conditions.46 The Venditto and Kol group
reported chloro-magnesium catalysts bearing monoanionic [NNNO]-type
ligands, they demonstrated that the catalysts had excellent activity
in the living polymerization of LA. Through step by step addition
of l-lactide (LLA) and d-lactide, the stereo-n-block PLA copolymers were obtained.20,21 Ma and co-workers reported magnesium complexes based on aminophenolate
ligands as catalysts in ROP of rac-LA, these magnesium
complexes exhibited high activity and good molecular weight control,
and heterotactic PLA can be generated.47 Wu also reported a series of binuclear magnesium alkoxides based
on bis-salalen ligands, they could realize an interesting mechanism
switch toward the controlled polymerization of LA: at high temperatures,
a coordination–insertion mechanism was suitable for the polymerization
process, and the ROP proceeded through an activated monomer mechanism
at low temperatures.48 To obtain high activity
catalysts, the synthesis of suitable ligands for the metal center
remained an important focus in this field.47

Under the guidance of previous research studies, the oxazoline
ligands and their metal complexes exhibited excellent properties in
many fields.49−51 Intrigued by the success of these studies, a family
of zinc and magnesium silylamido complexes based on aza(oxazoline)
ligands (Scheme 1)
were synthesized. These complexes were investigated as catalysts in
ROP of LA and ε-CL. These complexes showed high activity during
the ROP of LA and ε-CL.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ligands and Complexes 1a–8a
Results and Discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, ligands L1–L3, complexes 1a–3a, and 5a–7a possessed an
identical phenyl substituent at an oxazoline ring, with different
lengths and substituents at the amino backbone: C2 and −OCH3 for L1, C3 and −OCH3 for L2, C2 and −N(CH3)2 for L3.
Ligand L4, complexes 4a and 8a possessed a t-Bu substituent
at an oxazoline ring, C3 and −N(CH3)2 at the amino backbone. The results of the analysis were consistent
with their respective structures. The catalytic performance of complexes 1a–8a was studied in ROP of LLA and rac-LA, the polymerization data are presented in Tables 1 and S1. The results showed that the molecular weights
of the obtained polymers were lower than the calculated theoretical
molecular weight by monomer conversion and the amount of the catalyst.
This could be attributed to transesterification at high monomer conversion
and broad molecular weight dispersities.

As
displayed in Table 1, zinc complexes 1a–4a showed
moderate activity in ROP of LA. Among these zinc complexes, 3a showed the highest activity in the polymerization of LA.
For example, under identical conditions, at [M]/[cat] = 200, the reaction
progress was stabilized in 30 min with up to 98% conversion (Table 1, entry 8), which
was much faster than that of complexes 1a, 2a, and 4a (Table 1, entry 2, 5 and 11). Although magnesium complexes 5a–8a had identical ligands with the zinc counterparts 1a–4a, 5a–8a exhibited higher activity in the polymerization of LA with high
monomer conversion at ambient temperature. Complexes 5a and 7a both contain an identical phenyl substituent
at the oxazoline ring, identical length at the amino backbone, 5a had neutral O-ether donor groups in the amino backbone,
and 7a had N-donor groups alongside the amino backbone.
Complex 7a showed highest activity in the polymerization
of LA, at [M]/[cat] = 1000, the reaction progress was stabilized in
5 min with up to 97% conversion of the monomer (Table 1, entry 24), which was much faster than that
of complex 5a (Table 1, entry 16, 8 min 90%). It was postulated that the
different activities of 5a and 7a were due
to their different O/N-donor coordination abilities to the metal center.
Complexes 5a and 6a contain identical substituent
groups within their ligand framework, and different lengths at the
amino backbone. Complex 5a showed similar activity with 6a (Table 1, entry 13–16, 17–20). 8a contains the t-Bu substituent at the oxazoline ring and −N(CH3)2 at the amino backbone. From the above experiment,
−N(CH3)2 within the ligand framework
could increase the activity, however 8a exhibited lower
activity than other magnesium complexes (Table 1, entry 25–27). It was postulated
that the alternative t-Bu substituent at the oxazoline
ring was accompanied by decreased activity. The catalytic performance
of 1a–8a toward rac-LA polymerization exhibited scarce stereoselectivity and formed
atactic PLA (Table S1). It was believed
that the lack of the bulky steric group for complexes 1a–8a could barely control the insertion of different
chirality of LA monomers. As shown in Figure 1, a study on mass spectrometry of PLA obtained
from polymerization suggested that the polymer produced had a predominant
cyclic structure, which indicates that the intramolecular back-biting
existed. This result was different from that previously reported which
used zinc silylamido complexes.44 The interval
of peaks was 72 mass units, indicating transesterification in the
polymerization.

Figure 1 Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
spectrum
of PLA generated by complex 1a.

So as to research the effect of the structure on the activity
of
LA polymerization, in situ infrared spectroscopy was utilized. Figure 2 (Figures S1–S9) displays powerful absorption above 1182
cm–1 [(C–O–C) PLA] and 1241 cm–1 [(C–O–C) LA] were observed for all
catalyst systems. 1a–4a were researched
under identical conditions to determine activity towards LA polymerization
(Figure 3). Complexes 1a–4a appeared to show a scarce induction
period during the polymerization process. This result indicated a
fast initiation step, possibly due to the lack of bulky steric group
complexes.

PLA using 3a. The C–O–C peak for PLA (1182
cm–1) increased and the C–O–C peak
for LA (1241 cm–1) decreased over time. Reaction
conditions: [M]/[cat] = 200:1, [LLA]0 = 0.5 mol L–1, 60 °C.

LA], LA peak at 1241 cm–1, catalyzed by complexes 1a–4a. Reaction conditions: [M]/[cat]
= 200:1, [LLA]0 = 0.5 mol L–1, 60 °C.

Furthermore, the substituents
on the ligand backbone had a significant
effect on the activity of complexes 1a–4a. For example, 1a and 2a contained identical
substituent groups within their ligand framework, and different lengths
at the amino backbone. Complex 2a showed higher activity
than 1a, this result indicated that the C3 flexible amino
backbone could increase the catalytic activity. 1a and 3a contain an identical phenyl substituent at the oxazoline
ring, identical length at the amino backbone, 1a had
neutral O-ether donor groups in the amino backbone and 3a had N-donor groups alongside the amino backbone. 3a showed higher activity under the same reaction conditions, it was
postulated that the different activities observed using 1a and 3a could attribute to more powerful coordination
of the N-donors to metal center. 4a had a t-Bu substituent at the oxazoline ring, the C3 backbone and −N(CH3)2 at the amino backbone. The C3 backbone and −N(CH3)2 within the ligand framework could increase the
activity of the complexes. However, 4a exhibited similar
activity with 2a, it was believed that the alternative t-Bu substituent at the oxazoline ring was accompanied by
the decrease in activity. 1a–4a exhibited
moderate activity in ROP of LA and the activity was remarkably influenced
by the substituent groups within the ligand framework.

The polymerization
of rac-LA was investigated
through in situ IR. As shown in Figure 4, the polymerization time versus monomer conversion
was investigated. It could be concluded that the complexes had similar
activity in ROP of LLA and rac-LA. This result indicated
that the complexes showed no stereoselectivity on ROP of LA.

PCL was another widely used biodegradable
material. To expand the
application of the complexes, the ROP of ε-CL using 1a–8a as catalysts was also investigated. Polymerization
was examined detailedly; the molecular weights and dispersities are
presented in Table 2. Similarly, in LA polymerization, the zinc complexes 1a–4a showed lower activity in the polymerization
of ε-CL than magnesium complexes 5a–8a.

Complex 3a showed the highest activity
in the polymerization
(Table 2, entry 5–7)
than other zinc complexes. 5a–8a showed
higher activity in the polymerization than 1a–4a. Complex 7a showed highest activity (Table 2, entry 14–15). 8a exhibited lower activity than other complexes, at [M]/[cat]
= 1000, only 40% monomer conversion at 10 min (Table 2, entry 17). This indicated that the t-Bu substituent at the oxazoline ring had a negative effect
on the catalytic activity. Different from LA polymerization, the data
showed that molecular weights of the obtained polymers were higher
than the calculated theoretical molecular weight. This could be attributed
to the bulky initiating group N(SiMe3)2 which
hindered the initiation process.44,54

In situ
IR displayed a typical polymerization profile catalyzed
by complexes 1a–4a (Figures 5 and S10–S16), a strong absorption just above 1290 cm–1 (ε-CL)
decreased for all catalyst systems, complexes 1a–4a were explored under identical conditions to understand
more about the polymerization process (Figure 6).

conditions: [M]/[cat] = 200:1, [CL]0 = 0.5 mol L–1, 60 °C.

Complex 3a showed the highest activity under
identical
conditions, this result could be attributed to N-donor groups within
the amino backbone. Different from LA polymerization, complex 1a showed higher activity than 2a, this result
indicated that the C3 flexible amino backbone had a negative effect
to the catalytic activity on the polymerization of ε-CL. It
was postulated that different activities could be due to the different
ring strain energy of LA and ε-CL.

Conclusions
A
family of zinc and magnesium complexes with the oxazoline ring
structure were prepared. Polymerization studies disclosed that 1a–8a had different activities upon cycle
ester polymerization, due to their different substituents and backbone
length. As for zinc-based complexes 1a–4a, a strong N-donor group’s substituent had moderate activity.
Magnesium-based complexes 5a–8a had
higher activity than zinc-based complexes. The N-donor substituent
also had higher activity than the o-ether substituent. The different
substituents at the oxazoline ring altered the polymerization activity
of LA and ε-CL, the t-Bu substituent showed
a negative effect on the catalytic activity.

Experimental Section
All experiments were carried out under a dry argon atmosphere or
standard Schlenk techniques. Materials and solvents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethyl acetate (by CaH2), ε-CL
(by CaH2), and toluene (by Na) were distilled to remove
traces of water under an Ar atmosphere. LA was recrystallized using
ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum. NMR spectra were recorded on
Bruker AV 400 M in CDCl3 and GPC measurements were conducted
with a Waters 515 GPC with CHCl3. In a typical polymerization
experiment, a solution of complexes 1a–8a (add in desired ratio) in 4 mL toluene and monomer (LA 0.50 g, 3.47
mmol, or ε-CL 0.4 g, 3.51 mmol) in 10 mL toluene were added
to a dry single-necked flask equipped with a magnetic bar. These operations
were carried out in a glove box. The mixture was heated to a designed
temperature in an oil bath out of the glove box. After certain time,
conversion of polymerization was determined by NMR. The mixture was
dropped into ethanol, the precipitated polymer was collected by filtration
and further dried under vacuum. Please see the Supporting Information for the detailed process of the synthesis
and characterization of ligands L1–L4 and complexes 1a–8a.
