Rapid and simple
methods to determine histamine in tuna fish have
been examined. A dry extract system for infrared (DESIR) was coupled
with near-infrared spectroscopy in order to obtain the absorption
of histamine in tuna fish at the ppm level. The result showed that
the optimal extraction solvent for preparing DESIR samples was 75%
methanol and boiling water (100 °C). Calibration equations were
developed and tested by independent validation set samples. The calibration
equation developed from boiling water as solvent extraction was slightly
better than the equation developed from 75% methanol solvent with
a coefficient of determination (R2) of
0.79, a standard error of calibration of 2.45 ppm, a standard error
of prediction of 2.94 ppm, and a bias of 0.10 ppm. Furthermore, the
predicted values from both equations were not significantly different
from the reference values obtained from the standard method at the
95% confidence interval. Compared to the current AOAC fluorometric
official method, the proposed technique simplified and reduced the
preparation time.

==== Body
Introduction
Nowadays, the fish processing industries
are expanding due to population
growth, leading to an increase in raw fish and fish product consumption.
Microbial contamination during processing and storage is essential
because this is the key factor that leads to histamine poisoning.
The presence of histamine is due to the bacterial decarboxylation
of histidine, which is an amino acid present in high levels in muscle
tissues of the Scomberiscida and Scombridae families1 that include tuna. Among foods containing histamine, tuna
is one of the most extensively consumed. Scombroid poisoning or histamine
poisoning is a type of food poisoning with symptoms and treatment
similar to those associated with seafood allergies.2 The risk of histamine poisoning is increased when fish
are kept at temperatures above 4 °C.3 Histamine levels are therefore used as an indicator of a good manufacturing
practice and preservation step.

There are numerous methods for
histamine analysis. The AOAC fluorometric
procedure is an official method most commonly used for histamine analysis
in foods.4,5 Many other analytical techniques, including
thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and enzymatic tests, have
been developed for histamine determination in food.6 TLC is simple and does not require special equipment, but
most of the published reports suffered from the excessive time needed
for analysis and/or inaccuracy of the obtained results. CE is not
so often applied for determining histamine because its detection limits
is 2 ppm that is too high to detect histamine in tuna, while the detection
limit of the fluorometric method is 0.5 and that of the HPLC method
is 1 ppm.7 Enzyme-based methods offer a
rapid means of detection,
but enzymes are unstable and expensive test kits are needed, and these
methods tend to overestimate the histamine content.8 The most widely used and officially accepted method to
detect histamine in fish is a batch fluorescence method (AOAC 977.13).
The fluorometric procedure is sensitive and reproducible9 but complex and time consuming.

Near-infrared
(NIR) spectroscopy has attracted a great deal of
attention owing to its rapidity and simple analysis. NIR spectroscopy
can be used to identify and quantify most organic molecules from vibrational
absorption at specific frequencies. NIR spectroscopy has been used
to determine the matrix component and composition in fish such as
moisture, fat, and protein contents in tuna fish10 and fat, protein, and dry matter in Atlantic halibut fillet.11 Histamine in fish and fish product can be found
at the parts per million (ppm) level, whereas NIR spectroscopy requires
concentrations above about 0.1%.12 However,
several techniques coupled with NIR spectroscopy have overcome this
limitation. Some research studies detected low-concentration analytes
by developing spectra pretreatment and wavelength selection with chemometric
methods. For example, orthogonal signal correction and net analyte
signal were used to pretreat the NIR spectra before partial least
squares (PLS) modeling.13,14 Some others applied
NIR coupled with the preconcentration technique. For example, carbaryl
and HZ818 macroporous adsorption resin were employed to detect low-concentration
analytes in aqueous solution by near-infrared diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy.15

Another method to
concentrate the amount of the analyte is the
dry extract system for infrared (DESIR).16 In this procedure, a liquid containing the extracted constituent
of interest is dried onto a solid substrate with low IR absorptivity.
The drying step allows the analyte to be more concentrated, and the
solvent is removed. Then, the absorbance is acquired by NIR or IR
spectroscopy.17 A successful DESIR technique
is introduced to detect fungicide contamination on tomato surface.18 In that work, glass microfiber filter (GMF)
paper was used as the substrate to extract analytes before NIR measurement.
The best model was obtained when adding 2 mL of fungicide solution
to the filter paper in a polystyrene Petri dish, with standard errors
of prediction (SEPs) of 6.58 and 7.89 ppm for standard solutions and
real tomato samples, respectively.

Many researchers have applied
DESIR for quantification and authentication
applications such as beverages, milk, wine, beer, coffee, tea, and
meat by drip or centrifuged meat juices.19 One important step for DESIR is sample extraction by a solvent.
In the fluorometric method, 75% methanol in water is used as the extraction
solvent for derivatization before measuring fluorescence in canned
tuna.20,21 Since the result of the DESIR combined with
the NIR technique depends on the solvent and extraction method, this
study aimed to compare the efficiency of three solvents, namely, 75%
methanol, 100% methanol, and boiling water (100 °C), for extracting
histamine in tuna fish and to create a calibration model to determine
histamine content using NIR spectroscopy.

Materials and Methods
Reference
Analysis
The histamine content was determined
according to the AOAC 977.13, 1990 official fluorometric method. Frozen
tuna fish samples were thawed by a microwave oven (R-240, Sharp, Thailand)
before being ground by a rotating knife chopper (FP200, Kenwood, Japan).
Fifty grams of tuna fish was ground and thoroughly homogenized (Eurostar
digital, Ika Werke, Germany) with 75% methanol, and then, the volume
was adjusted with 75% methanol until it reached 50 mL. After warming
at 60 °C for 15 min in a water bath, the sample solution was
filtered through Whatman filter paper no. 1. A 1 mL aliquot of clear
filtrate was passed through a resin column into a flask containing
5 mL of 1 N HCl and rinsed with distilled water until the total volume
was 50 mL. After that, 5 mL of solution was pipetted into a 50 mL
Erlenmeyer flask and filled with
10 mL of 0.1 N HCl, 3 mL of 1 M NaOH, 1 mL of 0.1% o-phthaladehyde, and 3 mL of 3.75% H3PO4 followed
by fluorescence measurement. The concentration of histamine was calculated
based on the standard curve. The fluorescent intensity of samples
and standards was measured by a fluorimeter (6280 fluorimeter, Jenway,
U.K.) with excitation wavelength at 350 nm and emission wavelength
at 444 nm. The standard error of the laboratory method (SEL) representing
the precision of a laboratory method was investigated. SEL is the
standard deviation of the difference between duplicates of samples
and computed using the following formula.22 1  where x1 – x2 is the difference of the values from repeat
analysis of sample i, and N is the
number of the samples.

Dry Extract System for Infrared (DESIR)
Skipjack tuna
samples (Katsuwonus pelmis) were prepared by DESIR,
which was modified
from the official fluorometric method to reduce time and sample preparation
steps. This research consisted of two experiments.

In experiment
1, the efficiency among three solvents 75% methanol, 100% methanol,
and boiling water (100 °C) was compared and the condition for
removing solvent in DESIR samples was evaluated. Ground tuna fish
was divided into four parts; each part contained 50 g of tuna. For
part 1, histamine was determined by the fluorometric method (reference
analysis). The other three parts of samples were prepared by the DESIR
method, and each of them was mixed homogeneously with 75% methanol,
100% methanol, and boiling water (100 °C). Then, the volume of
each sample was adjusted by the same extraction solvent until it reached
50 mL. The sample solution was filtered through Whatman filter paper
no. 1. A 1 mL aliquot of clear filtrate was passed through a resin
column into a beaker and rinsed with distilled water until the total
volume was 40 mL. Two milliliter of sample solution was put on a glass
microfiber filter (GMF) paper that was placed in a Petri dish. GMF
was used as a solid support in DESIR sample preparation because it
is a fast drying medium and has low adsorption ability in the NIR
region, which makes it suitable for NIR spectroscopy. The solvent
was removed by drying at 130 °C in an oven. The time to remove
solvent was recorded. The dried GMF (or DESIR) samples were kept in
a desiccator until they reached room temperature of about 25 °C.
Solvents that gave the lowest error for calibration equations would
be used in experiment 2.

In experiment 2, samples were prepared
by the DESIR method using
the selected solvent and calibration equations were created. The accuracy
of equations was tested according to ISO 12099 (2017) using an independent
validation set.

Spectral Acquisition
The spectra
of DESIR samples in
all experiments were measured using a Fourier transform (FT-NIR) spectrometer
(model MPA, Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) in the wavelength range of
4000–12500 cm–1 in diffuse reflectance mode
at a resolution of 16 cm–1. An integrating sphere
equipped with a lead sulfide (PbS) detector was used for spectrum
measurement. The average of 32 scans and reference spectrum was measured
in every sample. The reference material of FT-NIR spectrometer was
internal reference coated with gold. The DESIR sample or GMF paper
was placed at the measuring area on top of the spectrometer and then
a stainless steel reflector was put on top of the GMF paper to reflect
transmitted light back to the detector.

Data Analysis
All calibration equations were performed
using OPUS software (version 6.5, Bruker Optics, Billerica, MA). Partial
least squares (PLS) regression was carried out to construct calibration
equations with spectral preprocessing methods containing vector normalization
(SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), first derivative,
second derivative, first derivative and SNV, and first derivative
and MSC. The best spectral preprocessing method was selected by trial
and error to obtain calibration equations with the lowest errors.
Twenty-nine samples were used in experiment 1 for selecting the optimal
extraction solvent. PLS regression was validated by a “leave-one-out”
cross-validation method because there are a few samples for a separate
test set. The same samples were used for both developing the equation
and validating it. However, 82 more samples were used for validating
in experiment
2. The samples with minimum and maximum histamine contents were set
into the calibration set to ensure that the range covered the content
for samples in the validation set. The remaining samples were randomly
split into the calibration and validation sets with a 3:2 ratio resulting
51 and 31 samples, respectively. Calibration equations were developed
from calibration set samples, and the accuracy of the equations was
tested against values for the samples in the validation set.

The performance of various calibration methods developed from DESIR
samples prepared by different extraction solvents was compared by
calculating the standard deviation of prediction errors on a validation
set for each method.23 The correlation
coefficient (r value) between the two sets of prediction
errors was determined before calculating an interval for the ratio
of variances or K value23 as per the following
equation. 2  where tn–2,0.025 is the upper 2.5% point of a t distribution
on n – 2 degree of freedom. Then, an interval
for the ratio of standard deviations or L value was
determined.23 3  

The interval of the lower limit is
defined from  and the upper limit is defined
from 

where S1 and S2 are the standard
errors of prediction for eqs 1 and 2, respectively.
The values that are calculated from the lower and upper limits include
1; the standard deviations are not significantly different at the
5% level.

The prediction error is expressed as the standard
error of prediction
(SEP) and bias to indicate the predictive performance equations between
NIR and reference methods, which were calculated from variables in
the validation set. SEP is computed using the following equation. 4  where ŷi is the NIR predicted histamine, yi is
the value of the actual histamine value measured by the reference
method of sample i, and n is the
number of samples in the validation set.

Bias is calculated
using the following equation. 5  

According
to the results of experiment 2, the performance of selected
calibration equation was evaluated using the validation set according
to the procedure described in ISO 12099 (2017) for animal feeding
stuffs, cereals, and milled cereals products: Guidelines for the near-infrared
spectrometry based on statistical parameters, bias, SEP, and slope.24 The significance of the bias is determined by
a t-test as per the following formula; 6  where Tb is the
bias confidence limit, α is the probability of making a type
I error, t is the appropriate Student’s t value for a two-tailed test with degrees of freedom associated
with SEP and the selected probability of a type I error, and n is the number of independent samples.

If the bias
value is less than Tb,
the bias is not significantly different from zero.

The SEP expresses
the accuracy of NIR results relative to the reference
method values. The unexplained error confidence limit (TUE) is calculated from an F-test as follows 7  where TUE is the
unexplained error confidence limits; v = n – 1 is the numerator degree of freedom associated
with the SEP of the test set, in which n is the number of samples
in the validation process; and M = nc – p – 1 is the denominator
degree of freedom associated with the SEC, in which nc is the number of calibration samples and p is the number of factors (PLS equation).

If SEP is less than TUE, the SEP can
be accepted.

The slope, b, of the simple regression y = a + bŷ is often
reported in NIR
publications.

The slope can be calculated to check the hypothesis
that b = 1 8  where n is the number of
independent samples, s2ŷ is the variance of the n predicted values, and sres is the residual standard deviation as defined in the
following equation

 9  

In which a is the
intercept of equation; , where  is the mean of predicted values, y̅ is the
mean of reference values, and b is the slope; yi is the ith reference value;
and ŷi is
the ith predicted value obtained when applying the
multivariate model

The slope, b, is considered as different
from 1 when tobs ≥ t(1−α/2), where tobs is the observed t value, calculated according to
above equation, and t(1−α/2) is the t value obtained from the t distribution table for
probability of α = 0.05.

Results and Discussion
Optimal
Conditions for Solvent Removal
Extraction solvent
and other elements that can absorb in the NIR region might interfere
and overlap with the absorption of the target compound such as histamine.
Elimination of the solvent hence reveals important data about the
trace analyte. Investigation of optimal conditions to remove the solvent
was an important step for the DESIR sample preparation. In this research,
an oven drying method and an operating temperature of 130 °C
were selected. However, this temperature is higher than the boiling
point of 75% methanol (about 69 °C), 100% methanol (64.7 °C),
and water (100 °C), which were the extraction solvents in this
study. Moreover, histamine is not destroyed or deteriorated at this
temperature.25−27 The evaporation time in the oven was investigated
by comparing weights of the GMF before and after drying using a four-digit
analytical laboratory balance. When weights of the GMF before and
after drying were not completely different, it indicated that GMF
was completely dried. In this step, water was selected as the solvent
for testing the conditions of evaporation because the boiling point
of water is the highest among the solvents used. Two milliliter of
distilled water was put on a GMF that was laid in a Petri dish. Then,
the drying time of GMF at 130 °C was compared. Figure 1 demonstrates the result of
time for removing water solvent in an oven dryer at 130 °C.

Figure 1 Effect
of time on water removal from GMF by the oven dryer at 130
°C.

From Figure 1, weights
of GMF before and after drying were not significantly different from
11 min onward. This implied that there was no more solvent left on
GMF after 11 min of drying. Therefore, the suitable condition for
removing solvent in DESIR samples preparation was drying at 130 °C
for 11 min.

Experiment 1: Effect of Different Solvents
on Extraction of
Histamine for DESIR
Sample preparation for the DESIR method
was modified from the official AOAC 977.13 fluorometric method with
the intention to reduce the assay time and increase the number of
samples analyzed for routine analysis. The heating step and chemical
solutions added for making a fluorescent compound, which are not required
and necessary in NIR analysis, were eliminated. Furthermore, added
chemical can obscure histamine absorption. Therefore, the DESIR technique
could simplify sample preparation and reduce the preparation time
from 45 min to only 20 min, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Comparison of sample preparation between the
official AOAC 977.13
fluorometric method and the proposed DESIR method.

The efficiencies of each solvent (75% methanol, 100% methanol,
and boiling water) for DESIR sample preparation were compared and
investigated by the FT-NIR spectrometer. A total of 29 samples for
both calibration and validation procedures were carried out using
the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Figures of merit are shown
in Table 1.

Original spectra of DESIR samples prepared by 75%
methanol,100%
methanol, and boiling water as solvents are shown in Figure 3. The spectrum of sample is
derived from the unification of all component spectra and is unique
as a human fingerprint. It was found that spectral patterns from filtrates
extracted by all solvents were similar, indicating the resemblance
of their composition. From Figure 3, the prominent peak at 5235 cm–1 in all three spectra was identified as the absorption of GMF,18 and weak peaks at around 7353 and 6803 cm−1
arise from GMF as well, as shown in Figure 3. A weak peak at 4460 cm–1 related to amino acids is attributed to the N–H stretching
and NH3+ deformed vibration.12 The peak at 4460 was found in the spectrum of histamine
powder measured in the wavenumber range of 3500–7000 cm–1, as shown in Figure 4.

Comparison of the calibration
equations was done based on the lowest
standard error of cross-validation (SECV) and the highest coefficient
of determination (r2). Table 2 shows the results of calibration
equations developed from DESIR samples extracted by 75% methanol,
100%methanol, and boiling water solvents.

From Table 2, the
best calibration equation is achieved from boiled water as a solvent
with the lowest SECV of 2.33 ppm. The second one is 75% methanol (SECV
= 2.64 ppm) and the last one is 100% methanol (SECV = 3.07 ppm). This
result did not support the hypothesis that increasing the solvent
concentration can enhance the extraction yield16 as an equation developed from 100% methanol as a solvent
had a bigger error. The reason for the error might be that 100% methanol
affects the pH value that was not suitable for histamine extraction
in tissues of tuna fish sample.8,28 Consequently, 75% methanol
and boiling water would be used to extract histamine for experiment
2.

Experiment 2: Development of Calibration Equations for Determination
of Histamine Content in Tuna Fish
From experiment 1, 75%
methanol and boiling water were used as solvents for analysis in this
part. To obtain the stability of equation for determination of histamine
in tuna fish samples, adding more samples and increasing variance
were performed. Calibration equations were built from the calibration
set, and their accuracies were tested by the validation set. The calibration
set should be designed to cover all possible variations. The distribution
of histamine in calibration and validation sets is shown in Figure 5. Optimal quantitative
PLS models were built from trial and error for consideration of the
wavenumber region, number of factors, and pretreatment of spectra.
The results obtained by optimization are summarized in Table 3. The number of factors that
gave the lowest errors for the equations of 75% methanol and boiling
water solvents were 5 and 4, respectively, which were acceptable.
As the results of wavenumber selection, the variables in the ranges
about 6804–6094.3 and 5454–4242.9 cm–1 were selected for models of 75% methanol and boiling water solvents.
Regression coefficient plots of both 75% methanol and boiling water
solvents showed the major wavelengths needed to predict histamine
(Figure 6). The peaks
of the both regression coefficient plots at 4456 and 4463 cm–1 were observed, which are related to the absorption band of histamine
at 4460 cm–1 shown in Figure 4.

Figure 7 shows scatter
plots from the validation set obtained from 75% methanol and boiling
water as solvents in DESIR samples. A slightly better result was obtained
from boiling water as the solvent with the error from analysis or
SEP of 2.94 ppm and the ratio of SEP to standard deviation of reference
method value (RPD) of 1.80. The result received from DESIR prepared
with 75% methanol as the solvent showed the SEP of 3.18 ppm and RPD
of 1.66. The SEL or standard error of duplicates analyzed by the reference
method (fluorometric method, AOAC 977.13) for histamine content analysis
was 0.33 ppm, as calculated by eq 1. Comparison between SEP and SEL showed that the error
from DESIR and NIR techniques (SEP) was rather higher. Therefore,
the application of DESIR and NIR methods to detect the histamine content
was not suitable for process control but suitable for a rapid, simple,
and cheap method for screening analysis.

Figure 7 Scatter plots of actual
against predicted values in calibration
and validation samples extracted using (a) 75% methanol and (b) boiling
water as solvents.

Both boiling water and
75% methanol can extract histamine out of
fish meat. Both calibrations demonstrated the capabilities of analysis
by this technique. However, the errors from this analysis might be
due to the extraction procedure for the reason that solvent used in
the DESIR technique not only extract the substance interested but
also other compounds that can dissolve in methanol and boiled water.
Therefore, these undesirable compounds might interfere with the absorption
of histamine in the samples.

The error from this analysis is
expressed with SEP. A comparison
of SEP from two equations calculated by eqs 2 and 3 was performed.
R2 between two sets of prediction errors was 0.15 (Figure 8). From Table 4, the interval of
lower limit (0.73) and upper limit (1.61) covered 1, indicating that
SEP from two equations was not significantly different at the 95%
confidence interval. Thus, the calibration result developed from 75%
methanol as the solvent was reasonable as well as the one developed
from boiling water. Furthermore, for routine analysis, the performance
of calibration equations has to be evaluated according to ISO 12099,
which was calculated from eqs 4–9, and is shown
in Table 5.

From ISO 12099, bias values obtained from both equations
(bias
= 0.16 and 0.10 ppm for 75% methanol and boiling water, respectively)
were lower than bias confidence limits (Tb for 75% methanol = ±1.09 ppm and Tb for boiled water = ±1.01 ppm), verifying that NIR predicted
and reference values were not different in the statistical significance.
The slope test of both 75% methanol and boiling water solvents calculated
by eq 6 were tobs = 0.00, which were less than t(1-α/2) = 2.03, indicating that the slopes
were
not different from 1 at the 95% confidence interval. Moreover, SEP
= 3.18 and 2.94 ppm (for 75% methanol and boiling water, respectively)
were less than the unexplained error confidence limits (TUE for 75% methanol = 3.49 ppm and TUE for
boiling water = 3.20 ppm), verifying that SEP could be accepted. The
results showed that the NIR predicted values obtained from both solvents
were not significantly different from the actual values at the 95%
confident interval.

Conclusions
A rapid and simple method,
DESIR, considerably improves NIR applications
involving detection in the ppm level. The potential of this technique
was exhibited in calibration results. A good trend for the technique
that applies NIR and DESIR for screening and rapid determination is
observed, even though
this method is not sufficiently developed as compared to the AOAC
method. Extraction by boiling water is more cost-saving than 75% methanol
because no chemical is required. Boiling water therefore has advantage
over 75% methanol for long-term analysis by the NIR technique. In
the future study, the accuracy of histamine determination by NIR may
be improved by developing a preconcentration process or trying other
