A stapled α-helix peptide library
was designed and constructed
using a chemically modified phage display system for screening stapled-peptide
ligands against target proteins. The α-helix peptide library,
with two cysteine residues on the opposite side of the randomized
face, was modified with a rigid hydrocarbon staple linker on a phage.
The stapled α-helix peptide phage library was screened against
galectin-3 (Gal-3), a cancer-related galactose-binding protein. The
obtained stapled peptides showed a high binding affinity (Kd = 0.45 μM) despite being nonsugar ligands.
The stapled modification played important roles in stabilizing the
α-helical structure that contributed to the high binding affinity
to Gal-3. In addition, the best stapled peptide ligands showed specific
binding to Gal-3 among various carbohydrate-binding proteins. Thus,
the designed α-helix peptide phage library with a constrained
structure by the staple linker will advance the discovery of peptide
ligands with improved specificity and affinity.

Introduction
An α-helical
peptide is one of the important components in
protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and protein functions within
cells. There are many helical peptide-mediated biological interactions,
such as the tumor protein p53/hDM2 interaction,1 HIV infection (membrane fusion protein),2 estrogen receptor/coactivator proteins,3 and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family.4,5 α-Helix peptides have a great potential in the regulation
of PPIs related to various diseases; however, α-helical peptides
alone do not have a stable conformation due to the lack of factors
to stabilize their folding. To overcome this limitation, stapled peptides
have been developed, in which a pair of amino acids on the same helix
face are linked together via covalent bonds between side chains6,7 through several methods, including ring-closing metathesis,8 lactamization,9 cycloadditions,10,11 and thioether formation.12 Stapled peptides
have an improved α-helical structure,7 which is associated with increased binding affinity13,14 and specificity,13,14 cell-penetrating property,15 and extended half-life in serum.7,16 In addition, stapling and further modification of peptides can pharmacokinetically
stabilize peptide to make them long acting and enhance the oral bioavailability.17 Although various stapled peptide ligands have
been developed as PPI inhibitors based on natural α-helix peptide
scaffolds,13,14,16,18−20 the stapling strategy
is limited to fragment mimetics of natural proteins. The de novo design
of PPI regulators is still limited.

Recently, structure-designed
peptide phage libraries have been
developed to discover de novo peptide ligands for target proteins.21−24 Diverse peptides with stable secondary structures can produce ligands
with good selectivity and binding affinity to target proteins. In
addition, selective chemical modification methods of phage-displayed
peptides have attracted further attention in various fields, including
chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, because these methods can
extend the functionalities of peptide libraries by the addition of
artificial functional groups. A pioneering work in the field of chemically
modified peptide phage library was the development of a bicyclic peptide
library and the screening of peptides to inhibit a disease-related
protease.25 Structurally constrained cyclic
peptide libraries are useful for obtaining specific ligands to target
proteins.26,27 In addition, conjugating a sugar molecule
or an enzyme inhibitor to a phage-displayed library produced target-directed
peptide libraries and enabled the discovery of low-micromolar peptide
ligands for each target protein.28 Alternatively,
the peptide phage library was modified with a bait fragment that can
specifically bind to the desired target location to screen covalent
binder peptides, which has a benefit of high selectivity and less
off-target binding.29

Previously,
we reported a chemically modified phage-display system
for screening monosaccharide-modified peptide (glycopeptide) ligands
to a carbohydrate-binding protein.23,30,31 Selective glycopeptides with high binding affinity
to concanavalin A, a mannose-binding protein, were successfully identified
from structure-constrained peptide libraries designed based on α-helix
and β-loop structures.30−33 These studies revealed that not only target directivity
by glyco-modification but also a stable secondary structure of peptides
is important for the interaction with the protein. However, it is
difficult to strongly stabilize a secondary structure of short peptides
less than 20 amino acids. The stabilizing method of short peptides
will benefit the ligand screening for target proteins.

Galectin-3
(Gal-3) is a galactose-binding protein and is expressed
in the cytoplasm and nucleus and secreted from cells.34,35 Gal-3 has a carbohydrate-binding domain at the C-terminal side,
which binds to N-acetyllactosamine (Kd = 0.2 mM)36−38 and lactose (Kd = 1 mM),36−38 through hydrogen bonding with amino acids (His158,
Arg162, Asn174, and Glu184). The elevated expression level of Gal-3
is the evidence of its ability to enhance tumor cell adhesion to common
extracellular matrix proteins,39 to increase
lung carcinoma metastasis,40 and to help
cancer cells to resist from apoptosis.41−44 Therefore, Gal-3 is an important
target for cancer treatment and diagnosis.

Many types of antagonists
that bind to the carbohydrate-binding
domain of Gal-3 have been reported. The anti-Gal-3 antibody can reduce
the occurrence of metastatic lung colonies. The complex polysaccharide
ligands, GCS-100,35,45 GR-MD02, and GM-CT-01,46 induce apoptosis in myeloma cells.47 Peptide ligands, identified in a phage library
for Gal-3, blocked the adhesion of human breast carcinoma cells to
endothelial cells.48 However, potential
ligands are still being researched.

Based on these contexts,
in this study, we constructed a stapled
α-helix peptide library by combining a chemical modification
with a phage display method to produce a diverse structure-constrained
peptide pool for ligand screening (Figure 1a). Gal-3 was selected as a target protein
because it has a cleft-like structure around its galactose-binding
site to which an α-helical peptide can bind (Figure 1b). An α-helix peptide
library with six randomized sites was displayed on the filamentous
phage fd with the cysteine-free gene-3 protein (pIII).25,49 The library was designed to contain two fixed cysteine residues
as modification sites located on the opposite face of a randomized
region. A biphenyl (BP) derivative was used as a hydrocarbon staple
linker with a rigid structure to enhance the α-helical structure
of the peptides. Before affinity-based screening (biopanning), the
peptide phage library was chemically modified with a BP linker via
two thioether bonds of cysteine residues (Figure 1b).

is expected to have a stabilized α-helical structure and bind
to Gal-3 at the galactose-binding site with a cleft-like structure.

Results and Discussion
Construction of the Stapled
Peptide Phage Design
An
α-helical peptide library was designed as 16-mer peptides, GAX1ECX2X3KEX4X5CKX6AG (Xn = any of the 20 natural
amino acids), with six randomized positions on the same face of the
helix. The sequence of the peptide library was designed to have an
α-helical behavior by containing alanine residues (Ala2, Ala15)
due to its α-helix-stabilizing properties,50 two pairs of glutamate and lysine residues (Glu4-Lys8 and
Glu9-Lys13) to maintain the helical structure by an intramolecular
salt bridge formation (Figure 1a), and glycine residues at both ends of the peptide to stabilize
the backbone hydrogen bonds. Two cysteine residues were arranged at
the 5th and 12th (i and i + 7) positions
as the modification sites that were placed on the opposite side of
the randomized region (Figure 1a). 4,4-Bis(bromomethyl) biphenyl (BP) was used as a cysteine-reactive hydrocarbon
staple linker because a BP scaffold is not only suitable to crosslink
the two cysteine residues at the i and i + 7 positions, but also efficient to promote the cell permeability
of peptides due to its hydrophobic property.51 As a result, the BP-stapled peptides will have a stabilized helical
structure that can display six randomized amino acids on the same
face of the helix. Before the preparation of a peptide phage library,
a model peptide (mentioned as a control peptide later) with six alanine
residues at the randomized positions (H-GAAECAAKEAACKAAG-NH2) was tested for the staple modification by a BP linker (Supporting Information). The model peptide gave
the stapled product within 1 h without any side reaction (Figure S1). Although the model peptide did not
show an α-helical structure, the stapling reaction of the model
peptide almost completed within 1 h, indicating that any sequences,
including less helical peptides displayed on the phage, could give
the stapled product.

The non-cys fd bacteriophage was used to
achieve the selective staple modification of desired peptides displayed
on the phage. The phage library displaying the designed α-helix
peptides was produced by the genetic manipulation of a phagemid vector.
The obtained peptide phage library covered the theoretical diversity
(6.4 × 107) of peptides with six randomized amino
acids. Then, the peptide phage library was amplified and modified
with a BP staple linker to produce the stapled peptide phage library
before the screening process.

Affinity Screening
The peptide phage library was reduced
with TCEP to avoid disulfide bonds. After reduction, the BP staple
linker was reacted with a phage solution ([BP linker] = 10 μM,
[phage] = 100 nM) at 42 °C for 1 h. The BP-modified peptide phage
was purified and collected by a standard phage precipitation protocol
and resuspended in HBS [10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0]. The modification of peptides on
phages in previous studies confirmed that the modification condition
is sufficient.30,31 In addition, the number of phages
used for affinity screening was more than 1.0 × 1010 (Table S1), and the theoretical diversity
of the phage library was 6.4 × 107, meaning that more
than 150 copies for each sequence were included in the library. Therefore,
all kinds of peptide sequences could be modified with a BP linker.
Accordingly, the BP-stapled peptide phage was screened against biotinylated
Gal-3. Phages binding to Gal-3 were captured by streptavidin-magnetic
beads. After weakly bound phages were washed out, the remaining phages
were selectively eluted using an excess amount of lactose as a competitive
binder to Gal-3 to obtain peptide ligands that bind to the galactose-binding
site of Gal-3. To concentrate the phages bound to Gal-3, the amount
of Gal-3 was decreased from 1.0 μg (first and second rounds)
to 0.5 μg in the third and fourth rounds of biopanning. The
recovery yield of the phage pool in each round was monitored by phage
titration (Table S1 and Figure S2). The yield increased from the first to second round,
indicating that Gal-3-bound phages increased. In the third round,
the yield decreased due to less Gal-3; however, the yield increased
again in the fourth round, indicating the enrichment of Gal-3-bound
phages. The screening efficiency was also checked by a phage ELISA
using all phage pools (Figure S3). In the
case of the phage library before screening, phages displaying non-stapled
peptides showed fluorescent intensity similar to the phage displaying
stapled peptides, indicating that the phage library contains many
phages that do not specifically bind to Gal-3. The phage pools with
a staple modification after the first and second biopanning clearly
showed higher fluorescent intensity than those without staple modification.
The fourth-round phage pool showed the most significant difference
in fluorescent intensity with and without staple modification, suggesting
that phages displaying stapled peptides binding to Gal-3 were successfully
obtained. After the cloning and DNA sequencing of individual clones
from the fourth-round phage pool, 27 phage clones were identified
(Table S2). Although there was no consensus
sequence, most peptides contained polar amino acids (Gln, Asn, Ser,
and Thr) that could form hydrogen bonds to the binding site of Gal-3.
Twenty-six clones were classified based on their total net charge
from −2 to +2 at pH 7.0. The clone with an extra cysteine residue
in the peptide sequence was ignored because this peptide might form
an undesired cross-linked structure. There were many peptide sequences
in the category of +1 and neutral net charge. Then, 10 different representative
clones were selected from each category (Table 1), and a phage ELISA using individual clones
with and without staple modification was performed to verify the ability
of the phages to bind Gal-3 (Figure 2). Among the representative clones, five phage clones
(c3, c4, c8, c9, and c10) showed increased fluorescent intensity.
In particular, these five clones displaying a stapled peptide exhibited
higher fluorescent intensity than non-stapled phages did; in contrast,
other phage clones did not show a significant difference despite the
presence or absence of staple modification. These results suggest
that several stapled peptides that bind to Gal-3 were successfully
screened and that the staple modification contributed to their binding
ability. Among these five clones, c4, c8, and c10 were selected for
further validation experiments. The c3 and c9 clones were removed
because they have the same net charge as c4 and c10, respectively,
and showed lower fluorescent intensity than those clones.

Structural Analysis of Peptides
To investigate the
detailed characteristics of displayed peptides, the three peptides
from the c4, c8, and c10 phage clones were chemically synthesized
as p4, p8, and p10, respectively (Table 2). These peptides were modified with the
BP linker to produce the stapled peptides, p4-BP, p8-BP, and p10-BP.
In addition, a peptide with six alanine residues at randomized positions
was synthesized as a control peptide (control) and modified with the
BP linker to produce control-BP. The secondary structure of all peptides
was evaluated by circular dichroism spectrometry (Figure 3). All non-stapled peptides
showed a negative maximum at 200 nm, suggesting a random coil structure
(Figure 3a). On the
other hand, p4-BP, p10-BP, and control-BP exhibited typical spectra
for α-helical structures with double-negative maxima at 208
and 222 nm (Figure 3b). The p8-BP did not show a significant change after BP modification.
Since p8-BP and p10-BP contain proline residues, their α-helical
structure might be distorted.52 In the
case of p10-BP containing one proline residue, the BP linker can maintain
the α-helical structure, because this proline residue is placed
outside of a stapled region. In the case of control-BP, the alanine
has a helix-forming propensity and a small side chain structure that
can avoid steric hindrance between side chains and the BP linker.
As a result, control-BP exhibited the highest α-helical content
(60%), followed by p4-BP (32%) and p10-BP (30%) (Table 2). This result clearly suggests
that the BP linker can enhance the α-helical structure of these
peptides.

Binding Affinity
of Peptides
To evaluate the binding
affinity of the screened peptides (p4, p8, and p10) and the control
peptide to Gal-3, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides (p4-flu,
p8-flu, p10-flu, and control-flu) were chemically synthesized. Fluorescein
was introduced into the side chain of a lysine residue at the C-terminal
of peptides via a triglycine spacer (Table 2). These labeled peptides were also modified
with the BP linker to produce stapled-fluorescent peptides (p4-flu-BP,
p8-flu-BP, p10-flu-BP, and control-flu-BP). The binding affinity of
the peptides to Gal-3 was determined by fluorescence titration experiments
(Figures 4a and S4–S6). Fluorescein-labeled peptides were
titrated with Gal-3, and the dissociation constants (Kd) were estimated by analyzing the fluorescent intensity
change with a nonlinear least-square curve-fitting method based on
the 1:1 stoichiometry model (Table 2). The Kd value of p4-flu-BP
was determined to be 0.45 μM, which was 2000-fold lower than
that of lactose (1 mM). This result suggests that a high binding affinity
ligand was successfully screened from the stapled α-helix peptide
phage library. The p4-flu peptide without staple modification did
not show significant fluorescent changes, indicating that staple modification
is important for high binding affinity. In addition, the apparent Kd value of p4-flu-BP was increased to 3.75 μM
in the presence of excess lactose (100 mM) compared with the absence
of lactose (0.45 μM), which was 8.3-fold higher than that of
p4-flu-BP alone (Figure 4a, Table 2). This
result suggests that p4-flu-BP bound to the galactose-binding site
of Gal-3. Similarly, p10-flu-BP exhibited good binding affinity (Kd = 1.16 μM) to Gal-3 in a competitive
manner to lactose (Kd = 4.74 μM
in the presence of 100 mM lactose), and p10-flu without staple modification
did not show any Gal-3 binding (Figure S5, Table 2). These
results suggest that p10-BP also competitively binds to the galactose-binding
site of Gal-3 and that staple modification plays an important role
in high binding affinity. On the other hand, the binding affinity
of p8-flu and p8-flu-BP peptides could not be evaluated because the
fluorescent intensity change was not well related to the Gal-3 concentration
(Figure S4). Since the excess amount of
lactose did not significantly affect the change in the fluorescent
intensity of p8-flu-BP, the p8-BP peptide might interact with Gal-3
in a nonspecific manner. The Kd values
of the control-flu and control-flu-BP peptides were also not estimated
for the same reason (Figure S6). As a result,
selected amino acids of p4 and p10 peptides are important components
for the specific binding to the carbohydrate-binding domain of Gal-3.
However, the different driving forces between p4-flu-BP and p10-flu-BP
in binding to Gal-3 should be considered because p4-flu-BP contains
non-charged amino acids (glutamine and serine), while p10-flu-BP contains
charged amino acids (lysine, arginine, and glutamic acid). The Gal-3
protein contains some hydrophilic amino acids, such as Asn160 and
Asn174, that interact with lactose via hydrogen bonding (Figure S7a), implying that the non-charged amino
acids of the p4 peptide partly mimic the sugar unit. In contrast,
Gal-3 has charged amino acids, such as Glu165, Glu184, Arg144, His158,
and Arg162, around the galactose-binding site that could make electrostatic
interactions with the p10 peptide. The tyrosine residue is common
between two peptides, which might make a hydrophobic interaction with
Trp181 located at the galactose-binding site of Gal-3 (Figure S7b). The valine residue in p4-flu-BP
seems to also contribute to hydrophobic interactions. Additional hydrophobic
interactions might contribute to the improved Gal-3 binding of the
p4-BP peptide compared with that of the p10-BP peptide.

curves represent a nonlinear least-squares curve fitting based on
a 1:1 stoichiometry model.

Other carbohydrate-binding proteins, such as concanavalin A (Con
A, a mannose-binding protein), peanut agglutinin (PNA, a galactose-binding
protein), and Ricinus communis agglutinin
I (RCA I, a galactose-binding protein), were used to evaluate the
binding specificity of the p4-flu-BP peptide to Gal-3 (Figure 4b). The results of the fluorescence
titration experiment showed no significant fluorescent change in p4-flu-BP
in the presence of Con A, PNA, or RCA I. This result clearly suggests
that the p4-BP peptide specifically binds to Gal-3. In particular,
p4-BP could discriminate Gal-3 from PNA and RCA I although these three
proteins have the same galactose-binding function, meaning that the
p4-BP peptide not only mimics the galactose moiety but also selectively
recognizes the surface cleft-like structure of Gal-3.

Conclusions
We successfully constructed a stapled α-helical peptide phage
library and identified Gal-3-binding stapled peptides with good binding
affinity and selectivity. The designed peptides displayed on the pIII
coat protein of the phage library were modified with a rigid hydrocarbon
staple linker through thioether bonds via two cysteine residues. After
affinity-based screening, several phage clones with binding affinity
to Gal-3 were identified. The secondary structure of the isolated
peptides was stabilized as an α-helix structure by stapling
with a rigid BP linker. The stapled peptides, p4-flu-BP and p10-flu-BP,
showed high binding affinity to the target protein, Gal-3; the binding
affinity of these peptides was 1000-fold better than that of lactose,
a simple carbohydrate. These stapled peptides bound to the galactose-binding
site with a cleft-like structure and the best peptide p4-flu-BP showed
specific binding only to Gal-3. The stapled peptide ligand could be
conjugated with nanoparticles for drastic improvement in the binding
affinity to Gal-3, because we previously demonstrated that glycopeptide
ligands displayed on gold nanoparticles exhibited high binding affinity
by a multivalent effect.33 In addition,
different kinds of staple linkers will be examined for further improvement
in the quality of the peptide library, including the availability
for other PPIs in the future. Therefore, the structure-based design
of a stapled α-helix peptide library could be utilized for the
discovery of peptide ligands with high specificity and improved binding
affinity toward the target protein.

Experimental Section
Construction
of the Peptide Phage Library
A detailed
procedure is described in the Supporting Information Briefly, the phagemid vector (fdg3p0ss21-library) encoding α-helix
peptides with six random amino acids (GAX1ECX2X3KEX4X5CKX6AG; Xn = any of the 20 natural amino acids) was
constructed according to a previously reported method.25,32,33,49 The PCR primer sequences are shown in Table S3. NNK codon (N = A, T, C, G; K = G, T nucleotide) was used
for the randomized positions to encode all 20 amino acids eliminating
possible stop codons. A 16-mer peptide phage library was generated
by the electroporation of the fdg3p0ss21-library phagemid vector into
TG1 Escherichia coli cells. The diversity
of the library was estimated to be approximately 5.92 × 109 colonies that can cover the theoretically possible peptides
(206 = 6.4 × 107). Before affinity screening
(biopanning), glycerol stocks of library-transformed TG1 E. coli cells were cultured in a 2YT medium supplemented
with chloramphenicol (30 μg/mL) to prepare the phage pool. The
amplified phage was collected by a standard phage precipitation protocol.53,54

Preparation of the Stapled Peptide Phage Library by Chemical
Modification
The peptides displayed on the phages were chemically
modified with the BP staple linker to prepare a stapled α-helix
peptide phage library. The disulfide bond was reduced by incubating
phage (100 μL, 100 nM) with excess TCEP (1.0 mM) in a degassed
reaction buffer [20 mM NH4HCO3, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), pH 8.0] at 42 °C for 1 h. The reduced phage was
collected by the standard phage precipitation protocol and resuspended
in degassed reaction buffer. The BP staple linker dissolved in acetonitrile
(1.0 mM) was added to the phage solution ([BP linker] = 10 μM,
[phage] = 100 nM), and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C for
1 h. Finally, the BP-modified phage was purified and collected by
the standard phage precipitation protocol and resuspended in HBS (10
mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0).

Expression of Gal-3 Protein
and Biotin Modification
The pGEX-4T-2 bacterial vector with
the cDNA of human galectin-3
(LGAL3, Bioresource Center, RIKEN)55 was
transformed into E. coli BL21-Codonplus
(DE3)-RIPL competent cells (Agilent Technologies). The expression
of GST-tagged Gal-3 was conducted in a 2YT medium with antibiotics,
protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mM), and the cells were incubated
at 37 °C for 3 h. After the induction period, the bacterial pellet
was collected by centrifugation and lysed by ultrasonication in the
presence of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, the supernatant
was applied to a Glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography column (GE
Healthcare) for affinity purification of the GST-Gal-3 protein. The
GST-Gal-3 protein was eluted with an elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 10
mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The GST tag was removed from the GST-Gal-3 protein by
the thrombin treatment. The cleaved Gal-3 was purified by the lactose
gel affinity column chromatography (EY Laboratories). The bound Gal-3
was eluted with 100 mM lactose (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.3),
and the buffer was exchanged for HBS by ultracentrifugation with an
Amicon centrifugal filter (10 kDa, MWCO) at 4 °C and 7500g for 15 min.

Purified Gal-3 was biotinylated by using
biotin-AC5-OSu (10 equiv) (Dojindo) at 37 °C for 1
h. The excess biotin-AC5-OSu was removed by ultracentrifugation
in the same manner. Biotinylation was confirmed using streptavidin-immobilized
magnetic beads (Dynabeads).

Affinity Screening (Biopanning)
The BP-modified phage
solution (100 nM in 100 μL HBS) was incubated with biotinylated
Gal-3 (1 μg) at room temperature for 1 h. The phage bound to
Gal-3 was captured with streptavidin-immobilized magnetic beads and
blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) by incubating at room temperature
for 15 min with gentle rotation (5 rpm). After the magnetic beads
were washed 5 times with HBS-T (HBS with 0.1% v/v Tween 20), the bound
phages were competitively eluted 2 times with excess lactose (200
mM in HBS). The eluted phages were infected with log-phase E. coli TG1 cells at 37 °C for 90 min, and infected
TG1 cells were cultured overnight for the amplification of the eluted
phage. The amplified phage was used for the next screening round.
The second screening was conducted in the same manner. Third and fourth
rounds of biopanning were conducted using reduced amounts of biotinylated
Gal-3, 0.5 μg for both rounds. The selection efficiency was
evaluated based on the percentage yield of the bound phage (output/input,
%).56 After the fourth round, 27 colonies
were selected for the preparation of phage clones. Peptide sequences
were identified by a DNA sequence analysis from isolated phage clones.

Phage ELISA
A phage-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) was conducted to evaluate the binding of phages to Gal-3.
A 96-well microplate (Corning, Costar 3690) was coated with Gal-3
(100 μL, 1.0 μg per well) at 4 °C overnight. After
3 washes with HBS, each well was blocked with 1% BSA (w/v) in HBS
at 4 °C for 1 h. The phage solution (1.0 nM, 50 μL) in
HBS was added to the Gal-3-immobilized well and incubated at room
temperature for 1 h. The well was washed with HBS 3 times, and an
anti-M13 phage antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each well (70 μL, dilution
of 1:500 in 1% (w/v) BSA/HBS) and incubated at room temperature for
1 h. After the well was washed with HBS 3 times, the substrate for
the fluorogenic enzyme reaction (QuantaBlu Fluorogenic Peroxidase
Substrate kit, Pierce) was added. The fluorescence (λex = 390 nm, λem = 475 nm) was measured with a microplate
fluorometer (Twinkle LB 970, Berthold Technologies). All phage pools
that underwent biopanning and the 10 selected phage clones after the
fourth round biopanning were used for phage ELISA with and without
staple modification. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05.

Peptide Synthesis
A detailed procedure
for the peptide
synthesis is described in the Supporting Information. The introduction of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein into the side chain
of the C-terminal lysine was conducted on the solid support. The purified
peptides were dissolved (100 μM) in a degassed reaction buffer
(20 mM NH4HCO3, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Then, the
BP linker in acetonitrile (10 mM) was added to the peptide solution
(final concentration was 1 mM). After the modification reaction was
conducted at 42 °C for 1 h, the stapled peptides were purified
by RP-HPLC and identified by ESI–MS.

Circular Dichroism Study
The circular dichroism spectra
of peptides were recorded on a JASCO J-1100 spectropolarimeter using
a quartz cell with a 0.1 cm path length at 25 °C. Stapled peptides
were dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0) to prepare a 50
μM solution. Non-stapled peptides were dissolved in Tris-HCl
buffer containing TCEP (1.0 mM). The α-helical contents of peptides
were calculated by a reported method.57

Evaluation of the Binding Affinity of Peptides
Fluorescein-labeled
peptides were used for a titration experiment with Gal-3 and other
carbohydrate-binding proteins (ConA, PNA, and RCA I). The stock solution
(100 μM) of fluorescein-labeled peptides was prepared with HBS
and diluted (10 μM) into protein solutions with various concentrations
from 0.625 to 20 μM in HBS. The mixture (100 μL) was incubated
at room temperature for 25 min in a test tube with gentle rotation
(5 rpm). After incubation, the mixture was transferred into a 96-well
plate (Corning, Costar 3915) and fluorescence intensity was measured
with a plate reader (PerkinElmer, 1420 Multilabel Counter ARVO MX)
(λex = 485 nm, λem = 535 nm). The
measurement was conducted 3 times for reproducibility. The fluorescent
intensity change was analyzed by a Graphpad Prism software using a
nonlinear least-square curve-fitting method based on a 1:1 stoichiometry
model to determine the dissociation constants of peptides to proteins.
In the cases of p4-flu-BP and p10-flu-BP, the same measurement was
conducted in the presence of 100 mM lactose as a competitor.
