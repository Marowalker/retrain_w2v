A one-pot
coupling of starch with alkyl amine was studied using
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as the coupling agent. Although reaction
occurred without a catalyst (24 h, 70 °C), different catalysts,
namely, imidazole, tetramethylguanidine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU), and combinations thereof were investigated to improve the reaction
efficiency. When 20 mol % DBU was used as a catalyst, the degree of
substitution (DS) could be improved from 0.05 to 0.15 compared to
the noncatalyzed reaction. When the amount of DBU was decreased to
5 mol %, catalytical activity remained, albeit with a slightly lower
DS (0.09). Temperature did not have a significant effect on the DS
but it could be used to alter the solubility of the product. Based
on chemical analysis, the alkyl group was attached to starch by the
formation of a carbamate group. As the carbonyl carbon in the carbamate
originated from DMC, which, in turn, can be produced from carbon dioxide
on an industrial scale, the current study provides a conventional
way to utilize carbon dioxide-based chemicals in the functionalization
of a natural polymer. DMC is also biodegradable and classified as
a nonvolatile organic component, making it an environmentally desirable
coupling agent.

Introduction
Nonrenewable
resources have long been the main source for chemicals
and materials utilized in science and industry. Due to concerns about
the depletion of nonrenewable resources, along with their possible
toxic and polluting properties, a significant amount of research has
been focused on the use of renewable materials instead. Natural polymers
are among the most promising renewable sources for the production
of green chemicals and materials. Natural polymers, such as polysaccharides,
can be utilized in their natural form, for example, in the paper and
pulp industry, or they can be converted into monomeric chemicals by
hydrolysis.1−4 Natural polymers can also be converted into semisynthetic polymers
by chemical modification.5−7 Chemical modifications are generally
intended to improve inherited properties of natural polymers, such
as poor water tolerance, low solubility, and thermoformability.

As a natural polysaccharide, starch is one of the most investigated
renewable raw materials to be used as a replacement for oil-based
sources, for example, in films8 and composite
materials.9 Similar to cellulose, starch
is a glucose polymer with abundant hydroxyl groups that can be used
in chemical modification to produce a bio-based material. Applications
of chemically modified starch include as flocculant10 and a wet-end additive in papermaking,11,12 a carrier for drug delivery,13,14 and a tissue engineering
scaffold,15 among others. Although starch
is largely present in food sources and its use in nonfood applications
is not entirely ethical, it is also widely available from many waste16,17 and nonedible resources.18,19 The utilization of
starch from waste and nonfood materials is potentially more desirable
ethically and more sustainable ecologically and environmentally.20

Starch has naturally high hygroscopicity
and low thermoformability,
and various chemical modifications have therefore been employed to
improve these properties. For example, grafting with a long carbon
chain can be used to invert the polarity of starch, and hydrophobic
material has been obtained through methods such as etherification,
esterification, and amidation. Although many of these methods have
good efficiency, they require the use of toxic and hazardous chemicals
(e.g., halogenated alkyls for etherification21 and acyl chlorides for esterification22) and multistep reactions (e.g., amidation of succinylated23 or carboxylated24 starch). Consequently, there is a demand for more environmentally
friendly methods of starch alkylation.

Recently, alkyl carbonate
esters have been studied for the alkylation
of polysaccharides, including cellulose25,26 and starch.27 Alkyl carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate
(DMC), are formally esters of carbonic acid, although they are traditionally
produced using chemicals such as phosgene. Lately, replacing the highly
toxic phosgene has been investigated, and alkyl carbonates have been
produced using carbon monoxide.28,29 An even more desirable
route is the production of alkyl carbonates directly from carbon dioxide;
DMC, for example, can be produced from carbon dioxide and methanol
on an industrial scale.30,31 DMC is a biodegradable
chemical with low toxicity that was exempted from the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s definition of volatile organic
compounds in 2009. These properties make DMC suitable for use in,
for example, phosgene-free synthesis of polyurethanes32 and polysaccharide modification.

To date, DMC has
been studied for the methylation of starch.27,33 In the current study, we investigate the possibility of executing
a one-pot coupling of long-chain alkyl amine (octyl amine; OA) with
starch, using DMC as a carbon dioxide-based coupling agent. The use
of catalysts, namely, imidazole, tetramethylguanidine (TMG), 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU), and mixtures of imidazole with either TMG or DBU, was investigated.
After identifying the most promising catalyst, the effects of catalyst
loading and reaction temperature were investigated. The degree of
substitution (DS) was determined using elemental analysis of the nitrogen
content of the products. The chemical characteristics of the products
were studied using diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy.

Results and Discussion
The chemical
modification of starch was performed using OA as the
alkyl amine, DMC as the coupling agent, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as the solvent. Without a catalyst, a DS of 0.05 could be obtained
(Table 1). It is postulated
that the reaction took place via the formation of methyl octyl carbamate
between the DMC and the OA, which were used in a molar ratio of 1:1,
followed by reaction with the starch to form starch alkyl carbamate
(Scheme 1a). Two moles
of methanol are formed as a byproduct. A similar, albeit two-step,
reaction has been previously utilized in the synthesis of natural-based
polyurethanes.34 Another possible reaction
mechanism is the formation of starch methyl carbonate, which then
reacts with the OA. Either way, nucleophilic substitution reactions
of carbonate ester are catalyzed many times by the base catalyst.35,36

To improve the relatively low DS
obtained without a catalyst, three
different basic catalysts, namely, imidazole, TMG, and DBU, were utilized.
In addition, stoichiometric mixtures of imidazole and either TMG or
DBU were studied as protic ionic liquid catalysts.37,38 When using imidazole, the DS of the product could be nearly doubled
from 0.05 to 0.09. Further improvement was observed using TMG (DS
= 0.13), and the highest was obtained using DBU (DS = 0.15). On the
other hand, the addition of imidazole together with TMG or DBU showed
no increase in the DS. DS obtained with OA and DMC is similar or even
slightly higher than that obtained by the alkylation of starch nanocrystals
with long alkyl chain cyclic acid anhydride.39

In the literature, DBU is a well-known catalyst, for example,
in
the transesterification of organic carbonates. A possible catalytic
mechanism in the DBU-catalyzed alkylation of starch is presented in Scheme 1b. The reaction involves
the lone pair of the DBU attacking the carbonyl carbon of the DMC,
resulting in the formation of a highly reactive intermediate.40,41 This activated carbonate then reacts with the amine group of the
OA to produce methyl octyl carbamate. It is possible that similar
activation of the methyl octyl carbamate is then repeated. Activated
octyl carbamate then reacts with the starch to form starch carbamate.
DBU, as a strong base, can also improve reaction efficiency by deprotonating
hydroxyl groups in the starch, leading to the formation of starch
alkoxide, which is highly reactive in nucleophilic reactions.42

To investigate if the presence of nitrogen
in the product was indeed
due to the carbamation of the starch, the reaction was also performed
catalytically (with DBU) using just DMC (sample 7 in Table 1) and just OA (sample 8), and
without either chemical (sample 9). No nitrogen was observed in these
cases, indicating that both DMC and OA are needed for the alkylation
of starch.

The effect on the DS of the molar ratio of DBU was
further investigated.
A small DS decrease from 0.15 to 0.11 was observed when the catalyst
loading was decreased from 20 to 15 mol %. On the other hand, DS remained
at 0.11 when a catalyst loading of 10 mol % was used; a minimal decrease
in nitrogen content was observed at 10 mol % compared to that at 15
mol %. In addition, the DS at a catalyst loading of 5 mol % was still
higher compared to the reaction without a catalyst (0.09 vs 0.05).

Temperature had a minimal effect on the DS, and only a slightly
lower DS was obtained when the reaction temperature was increased
from 70 to 90 °C, decreasing from 0.11 to 0.09. A further increase
in temperature to 100 °C resulted in a decrease of the DS from
0.09 to 0.08. At the high temperature, DMC is presented in the gas
phase of the reaction system, leading to lower reaction efficiency
at high temperature. The reaction temperature, however, had an effect
on the reaction mixture; at temperatures of 70 °C and lower,
a gel-like material was obtained after the reaction, most likely due
to the poor solubility of the product in the reaction mixture. In
contrast, when a reaction temperature of 80 °C or higher was
used, the reaction mixture was a clear, colorless solution. This difference
resulted in slightly different dissolution behavior of the product
as the sample obtained at 80 °C was slightly soluble in pure
DMSO, whereas other samples remained nonsoluble. This difference in
solubility might be due to the different substitution patterns of
the product obtained at 80 °C compared to that of other samples.
However, further studies are requested to confirm this.

Diffusion
reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy
provided further insight into the reaction mechanism. When the reaction
was performed in the absence of both OA and DMC, no apparent chemical
changes were observed (Figure 1). In addition, in the presence of OA but in the absence of
DMC, the product spectrum remained similar to that of pristine starch.
On the other hand, with DMC but without OA, a strong carbonyl vibration
band was observed at a wavenumber of 1760 cm–1.
This band is between cyclic (1790 cm–1) and linear
(1745 cm–1) carbonate esters,43 indicating that both are formed by the reaction of DMC
with starch (Scheme 1c). This is in contrast with previous results where methylation of
the starch has been observed after its reaction with DMC.27,33 However, linear carbonate esters of cellulose have been produced
in homo-25 and heterogeneous44 reactions of DMC and other acyclic carbonates.
The results here indicate that DMC is the main requisite for a chemical
reaction to take place.

with OA and DMC (sample 1). (B) DRIFT spectra of region 1900–1500
cm–1 where the most distinguished peaks of carbonate
and carbamate are indicated with dashed lines.

In the presence of both OA and DMC, two new distinct peaks were
observed at 1702 and 1534 cm–1. These peaks are
assigned to the carbonyl stretching and the NH deformation bands of
the carbamate group, respectively.45,46 The DRIFT
results strongly indicate that the alkylation of starch took place
via DMC-mediated amine coupling to form carbamate linkage between
the OA and the starch.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements were conducted
to further support the observations based on DRIFT. Only the peaks
relating to carbon (Figure 2) and oxygen (Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information) were observed in the pristine starch. Carbon
peaks at binding energies of 286.4 and 287.7 eV are associated with
the C–O and O–C–O bonds, respectively. The C–C/C–H
bond peak was observed at a binding energy of 284.8 eV. When starch
was allowed to react with OA in the absence of DMC, no nitrogen was
observed in the XPS spectrum. In addition, the only observable change
in the XPS spectra was a decrease in the intensity of the C–C/C–H
bond peak at 284.8 eV. This can be attributed to the removal of impurities
that exist in natural starch.47

Figure 2 High-resolution
spectra of C 1s regions: (a) starch; (b) starch
treated with OA; (c) starch treated with DMC; and (d) starch treated
with OA and DMC.

When starch was allowed
to react with DMC in the absence of OA,
a new peak was observed in both carbon and oxygen XPS spectra. The
peaks at binding energies of 290.7 eV44 (Figure 2) and 534.2
eV48 (Figure S1) are related to the carbonate ester moiety. This further confirms
the formation of starch carbonate when starch reacts with DMC in the
absence of amine.

When both DMC and OA are presented in the
reaction, no carbon peaks
relating to carbonate ester were observed. Instead, new carbon peaks
were seen at a binding energy of 289.6 eV, relating to the carbonyl
carbon in the carbamate group (O–CO–N).49,50 The intensity of the peak relating to the C–C/C–H
bond was observed to be higher compared to that of the sample prepared
without DMC (i.e., regenerated starch), indicating the presence of
an alkyl chain. Most importantly, and in contrast to other XPS spectra,
a nitrogen peak was observed at a binding energy of 400.0 eV (Figure S2). The presence of these peaks supports
the observations from the elemental analysis and DRIFT measurements
that OA is coupled with starch via carbamate formation. Based on XPS,
nitrogen content was found to be slightly lower compared to elemental
analysis (0.8 vs 1.12 mmol/g). This difference is most likely due
to the measurement techniques as the elemental analysis is a bulk
method, whereas XPS only analyzes the surface of a sample.

Due
to the partial solubility of the sample produced at 80 °C
(Table 1, sample 15,
DS 0.09) in DMSO-d6, it was characterized
using 1H and 13C NMR (Figure 3). The proton assignment of a starch moiety
corresponds to the previous assignments.51 The signals of OH protons at positions 2, 3, and 6 together with
proton H-1 can be seen between 4.57 and 5.49 ppm. Also, the characteristic
peaks of protons H-3 and H-5 can be clearly found at 3.65 and 3.58
ppm, respectively. The signals of protons H-2, H-4, and H-6 cannot
be assigned due to overlapping H2O signal. The successful
attachment of an octyl carbamate to the starch was also confirmed
by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. The signal at 0.86
ppm in 1H NMR (a peak in Figure 3A) relates to a CH3 group in the
octyl chain, and the signals at 1.24 and 1.39 ppm (peaks b and c)
can be assigned to six CH2 groups within the octyl chain.
The CH2 group closest to the nitrogen atom (peak d) is
observed at 2.95 ppm, and most importantly, a weak amide proton signal
can be seen at around 7 ppm.52 The degree
of substitution (DS) was determined using the following equation53  where A is the integral value
of methyl protons of the octyl chain and B is the
integral value of proton H-1 and OH protons at positions 2, 3, and
6. Based on the integration of the 1H NMR spectrum, the
DS of sample 15 is 0.090, which corresponds to the DS value received
from elemental analysis (Table 1). The assignment of carbon atoms (C1–6) of the starch
backbone (Figure 3B)
corresponds to the previous assignments.54 The assignment of carbon atoms (C1′–8′) of
octyl chain is also presented in Figure 3B. However, the signal of carbon atom C8′
next to the nitrogen stands underneath the DMSO peak.52 The signal of the carbonyl carbon could not be observed,
most likely due to its long relaxation time.55

Figure 3 (A) 1H and (B) 13C NMR spectra of starch
octyl carbamate (sample 15).

Previously, very high DS (around 3) of short carbon chain carbamate
has been obtained.56 However, previous
studies have utilized very hazardous isocyanates as reagents.56,57 Thus, the current study can be seen as a sustainable method to obtain
starch carbamate when low DS is desired. The low DS in the current
study might originate from the low solubility of octyl carbamate starch
in the reaction mixture. In addition, cross-linking of starch with
DMC might take place. However, as the reaction mixture remained clear
(no formation of gel) when the DMC was used without OA, the amount
of cross-linking might be negligible. It is notable that DS obtained
here is higher than alkyl starch having carbon chain lengths of 6
and 10 produced using alkyl epoxide.58

The hydrophobization of starch due to the addition of a long alkyl
chain is apparent in Figure 4. Directly after mixing with water, the starch became a cloudy
suspension, while starch octyl carbamate remained on the water’s
surface. After intensively mixing at 90 °C for 1 h, the starch
suspension became more gel-like; starch is known to gelatinize or
even dissolve in water. On the other hand, the starch octyl carbamate
could not be efficiently dispersed in water as some of the material
remained on the surface of the liquid, while the rest sank to the
bottom of the container. In this case, the water layer remained more
or less clear. This indicates that the introduction of long alkyl
chains on starch significantly alters the hydrophilicity of the material
and, therefore, its interaction with water.

Figure 4 Starch (left) and starch
octyl carbamate (right) in water (a) directly
after mixing and (b) after mixing at 90 °C for 1 h (solid content
1 wt %).

The starch octyl carbamate produced
here could only be dissolved
in DMSO. Although the low solubility of products can restrict their
usability in many applications, hydrophobized starch particles could,
for example, be used to produce a Pickering emulsion. Hydrophobized
microcrystalline cellulose has been studied for the production of
an emulsion between water and toluene.59 Moreover, it is also envisioned that further optimization of reaction
efficiency could be used to improve the DS, which could then lead
to better dissolution of the product.

In addition to the use
of DMC as a coupling agent, carbon dioxide
could be an even more sustainable reagent for starch carbamation.
Several studies have been conducted for the direct use of carbon dioxide
for the synthesis of alkyl carbamates from amines. However, instead
of the use of alcohols, titanium60,61 or silicate62−64 esters have been used in these reactions.

Conclusions
Starch
was alkylated with long-chain alkyl amine using DMC as a
coupling reagent. The use of basic catalysts improved the DS, and
the highest reaction efficiency was obtained using DBU as the catalyst.
Reaction temperature did not have a significant effect on the DS of
alkylated starch; however, the use of different temperatures could
be used to alter the dissolution of the product. The alkylation of
the starch method introduced here can be seen as environmentally friendly
because DMC is biodegradable and not classified as a volatile organic
component. Furthermore, DMC can be produced from carbon dioxide, and
this method could therefore be seen as a way to utilize waste carbon
dioxide-based chemical for the modification of natural polymers. Further
studies should be conducted to improve the DS of the product and to
investigate the possible applications of starch carbamate.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Starch from wheat, OA (99%), TMG (99%), DBU
(98%), and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6; 99.9 atom % D) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany);
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; ≥99.5%) and ethanol from VWR (Finland);
and DMC (>98.0%) and imidazole (>98.0%) from TCI (Belgium).
All chemicals
were used as received, without further purification.

Chemical Modification
of Starch
A reaction bottle was
charged with 0.5 g of starch, 9.5 g of DMSO, 1.56 mL (18 mmol) of
DMC, 3.06 mL (18 mmol) of OA, the desired amount (0–0.15 mol
%) of a catalyst (imidazole, TMG, or DBU), and a magnetic stirring
bar. The reaction vessel was closed with a Teflon cap, placed in a
heating block at a predetermined temperature (60–100 °C),
and allowed to react for 24 h under stirring in a closed system. After
reaction, the mixture was poured into 100 mL of ethanol under vigorous
stirring. The precipitated product was filtrated and washed with 500
mL of ethanol in 100 mL portion and, finally, dried in a 60 °C
oven overnight. Reference reaction was conducted using both DMC or
OA alone and without either of them. All of the used reaction conditions
are presented in Table 1.

Elemental Analysis
The degree of substitution (DS)
of the products was determined by analyzing their nitrogen content
with an elemental analyzer (PerkinElmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O). The
DS was calculated using the following equation  where N is the
percentage
of nitrogen, 162.15 is the molecular weight of the anhydroglucose
unit of starch, 157.24 is the molecular weight of the octyl carbamate
group, and 1401 is the atomic weight of nitrogen multiplied by 100.45,65

Chemical Characterization
Chemical characterization
of the starch and the alkylated starch was performed using diffusion
reflectance Fourier transform (DRIFT) infrared spectroscopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy. DRIFT spectra were collected from the dried samples
with a Bruker Vertex 80v spectrometer. The spectra were obtained in
the 600–4000 cm–1 range, and 40 scans were
taken from each sample at a resolution of 2 cm–1.

XPS was obtained using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB
250Xi (U.K.) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source,
operated at 300 W with a combination of electron flood gun and ion
bombarding for charge compensation. The take-off angle was 45°
in relation to the sample surface. The low-resolution survey scans
were taken with a 1 eV step and a 150 eV analyzer pass energy; high-resolution
spectra were taken with a 0.1 eV step and a 20 eV analyzer pass energy.
All measurements were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber pressure
(5 V·10–9 mbar). Prior to measurement, each
dry sample was pressed onto indium film.

Prior to the NMR measurements,
samples were dissolved in DMSO-d6 at 90
°C. The samples were placed in
5 and 10 mm NMR tubes, and the 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz spectrometer at
ambient temperature.
