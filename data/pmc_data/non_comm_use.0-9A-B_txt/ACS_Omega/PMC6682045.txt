The
activity of diethyl phosphite and diphenyl phosphate in propargylation
reactions with N-nucleophiles of varying basicity is presented. A
careful choice of the reaction conditions minimized undesired rearrangements
and arylation processes, typical side reactions with Brønsted
acid catalysis. These systems are compatible with technical solvents
and presence of air, and they are also applicable to C-, O-, and S-nucleophiles.

Introduction
Significant effort
has been placed in the development of efficient direct nucleophilic
substitution of alcohols, particularly allylic ones, even before it
was identified by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute Pharmaceutical
Roundtable as a priority area in the preparation of pharmaceutical
intermediates.1 The transformation of propargylic
alcohols is of particular interest because of their synthetic versatility,
and, accordingly, a range of transition-metal and acid catalysts have
been reported for this purpose.2 Brønsted
acids are especially promising in terms of cost, oxygen, and moisture
stability, and they are also very easy to separate from the desired
organic products.3

Sulfonic acids4 and phosphomolybdic acid on silica5 have been used with a wide range of C-, N-, and
O-nucleophiles in SN1 reactions of propargylic alcohols,
and we similarly reported the use of aqueous HBF4.6 These catalysts are compatible with air and reagent-grade
solvents, but they are obviously limited by the basicity of the chosen
nucleophile. Every system has to be optimized to avoid competitive
Meyer–Schuster and Rupe rearrangements.7−9 Furthermore,
Friedel–Crafts reactions are notoriously competitive for electron-rich
aromatic nucleophiles, such as anilines. Accordingly, only anilines
with electron-withdrawing groups are suitable substrates with the
reported systems10 as even catalysts of
modest acidity can mediate these arylations.11

Results and Discussion
Surprisingly, phosphorus-containing
acids have not been explored in these substitution reactions despite
their range of pKa12 and versatile reactivity. Hence, we started by screening
a selection of phosphorus-based acids in hot cumene with alcohol 1a and 4-methylaniline 2a as the model substrates
in air (Table 1). Complete
conversion into propargylic amine 3aa was observed with
phosphinic acid, but phosphonic and phosphoric acids led to no or
very low conversions (Table 1, entries 1–3).

Diphenyl phosphate led to high conversions to 3aa, with
only 1 mol % acid loading to minimize decomposition (Table 1, entry 4), and so did diphenyl
and diethyl phosphites (Table 1, entries 5–6), even if their tautomeric equilibria
are expected to be displaced toward their phosphonate form.13 Triphenyl and triethyl phosphites were both
acceptable catalysts for the model reaction (Table 1, entries 7 and 8), as they generate in situ
the corresponding (HO)P(OR)2 derivatives. Indeed, when
triphenylphosphite was heated at 110 °C for 24 h in technical
solvent, 11% of hydrolyzed diphenylphosphite was formed together with
2% of oxidized triphenylphosphate;14 when
water was added, all phosphite was converted into phosphonic acid
(83%) and triphenylphosphate (17%).

With three promising candidates
in hand, phosphinic acid, diethyl phosphite A, and diphenyl
phosphate B, we then reduced the amount of nucleophile
to 1.5 equiv, which only decreased the conversions with phosphinic
acid (Table 1, entry
1), while lower temperatures significantly reduced the conversion
into 3aa with all catalysts. We chose catalyst A over B since it is more than 30 times cheaper.15 Of note, while phosphate B was
recovered at the end of these reactions, phosphite A completely
hydrolyzed16 into a previously reported
anilinium phosphate salt,17 which was catalytically
inactive, as expected from the reactions with phosphonic acid (Table 1, entry 2).

Different solvents were then tested with phosphite A (Table 2). Identical
results were obtained with cumene or toluene, while ether solvents
led to relatively lower conversions (Table 2, entries 1–4). Only 46% conversion
into 3aa was obtained in benzonitrile, while no reaction
was observed in isopropanol (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). No chlorinated solvents were screened
due to their significant environmental and health hazards.

When varying the nucleophiles, the conditions often
had to be adapted, either because they reacted under milder conditions
or to minimize the decomposition and/or formation of undesired byproducts.
Unsurprisingly, anilines bearing electron-withdrawing groups readily
reacted with only 1 mol % A (Table 3, entries 1 and 2), and higher loading led
to the formation of an enone derived from of a Meyer–Schuster
rearrangement.

The conditions
originally optimized with p-toluidine led to the
preferential formation of Friedel–Crafts products with o-toluidine, but 3ad was the major product
when lower catalyst loadings and longer reaction times were employed
(Table 3, entry 3).
Lower reaction temperatures also minimized the formation of arylated
byproducts but at the expense of the overall conversion.

The
reaction with p-anisidine suffered from incomplete
conversions of the starting alcohol 1a, but higher acid
loadings or reaction temperatures only led to similar conversions
into 3ag and increased decomposition. Instead, longer
reaction times helped to increase the reaction conversions and 3ag was formed in 65, 75, and 87% NMR yield after 18, 24,
and 48 h, respectively (Table 3, entry 7).

Secondary anilines were also screened with
lower acid loadings to either prevent the formation of an undesired
enone (2h, Table 3, entry 8) or a Friedel–Craft arylation product (2i, Table 3, entry 9). The reaction of 1a and benzyl amine only
led to traces of the substitution product. We then tested Brønsted
acids previously reported for propargylation reactions with primary
amines, but again only traces of the desired product were obtained
with either phosphomolybdic acid on silica (together with unreacted
starting materials)5a or p-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid (together with decomposition).18

Excellent results were obtained with either
benzamide or thiobenzamide (Table 3, entries 10 and 11). Meyer–Schuster rearrangement
was competitive in the reactions with benzamide 2j, which
was minimized by lowering the reaction temperature, or alternatively,
using phosphate catalyst B, which selectively formed
amide 3aj. In contrast, the reaction with thiobenzamide
was completely selective with diethylphosphite A, even
when higher acid loadings were used.

Different alcohols were
successfully reacted with p-cyanoaniline, starting
with those with different acetylenic substituents (Table 4, entries 1 and 2). A lower
acid loading was used with mesityl-substituted alcohol 1d to minimize an undesired Meyer–Schuster rearrangement product
(Table 4, entry 3).
We also observed that electron-rich aromatics were not required for
the substitution reaction to proceed (Table 4, entries 4 and 5), although no reaction
was observed without an aromatic group at the propargylic position.

d 12% of the corresponding

Interestingly, an
allylic alcohol was also a good substrate for our catalytic systems
(Scheme 1), although
we only obtained very low conversions (<20%) with p-anisyl alcohol or benzhydryl alcohol as the starting material.

Finally,
to further showcase the potential of catalysts A and B, we reacted three typical O-, C-, and S-nucleophiles with
propargylic alcohol 1a (Table 5). Excellent results were obtained under
relatively mild conditions with indole, benzyl alcohol, and benzyl
mercaptan, particularly, with acid B. Allylic alcohol 1g also reacted readily with a S-nucleophile (Scheme 2).

Conclusions
We have developed two catalytic systems based on the readily available
Brønsted acids for nucleophilic substitution reactions of propargylic
alcohols with N-nucleophiles of increasing basicity. Allylic alcohols
as well as O-, S-, and C-nucleophiles were also suitable substrates
under the reported conditions, and all reactions were carried out
in technical solvents and in the presence of air.

Experimental
Section
General Remarks
All reactions were carried out in air
using technical solvents without any particular precautions to exclude
moisture or oxygen. Commercially available reagents were used as received.
(HO)P(OEt)2A and (HO)P(O)(OPh)2B were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with 98 and 99%
purities, respectively. Propargylic alcohols 1a,61b,61c,61d,61e,19 and 1f(16) were prepared according
to the literature procedures. Column chromatography and thin-layer
chromatography were performed on silica gel (Kieselgel 60), using
UV light and a phosphomolybdic acid dip to visualize the products.
Basified silica was prepared by submerging silica gel into petroleum
ether containing 2% v/v NEt3 overnight. Melting point ranges
were determined on an Electrothermal Gallenkamp apparatus and are
uncorrected. Infrared spectra were recorded in reciprocal centimetres
(cm–1) using a Fourier transform-infrared attenuated
total reflection spectrometer. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer
(1H: 400 MHz, 13C: 101 MHz, 19F:
377 MHz) at 23 °C. The chemical shifts, δ, are given in
ppm relatively to tetramethylsilane (0.00 ppm), CDCl3 (77.0
ppm), benzotrifluoride (−63.72 ppm), or solvent residual peak.
The multiplicity is given in br, s, d, t, and m for broad, singlet,
doublet, triplet, and multiplet, respectively. High-resolution mass
spectra were recorded on either a Micromass Autospec Premier, Micromass
LCT Premier or a VG Platform II spectrometer using ESI techniques
at the Mass Spectroscopy Service of Imperial College London.

General
Procedure
The chosen nucleophile (1.5 equiv) was added to
a solution of propargylic alcohol 1 (1.0 equiv) and (HO)P(OEt)2A or (HO)P(O)(OPh)2B in technical toluene (1 M). The reaction mixture was stirred at
110 °C on a heating block for 18 h before being cooled to room
temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
then purified by column chromatography (basified silica gel, eluent
was basified with 2% v/v NEt3).
