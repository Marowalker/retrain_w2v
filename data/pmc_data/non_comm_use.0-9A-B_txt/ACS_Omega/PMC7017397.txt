The cyclic hexapeptides PMX53 and
PMX205 are potent noncompetitive
inhibitors of complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). They are widely utilized
to study the role of C5aR1 in mouse models, including central nervous
system (CNS) disease, and are dosed through a variety of routes of
administration. However, a comprehensive pharmacokinetics analysis
of these drugs has not been reported. In this study, the blood and
CNS pharmacokinetics of PMX53 and PMX205 were performed in mice following
intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and oral administration
at identical doses. The absorption and distribution of both drugs
were rapid and followed a two-compartment model with elimination half-lives
of ∼20 min for both compounds. Urinary excretion was the major
route of elimination following intravenous dosing with ∼50%
of the drug excreted unchanged within the first 12 h. Oral bioavailability
of PMX205 was higher than that of PMX53 (23% versus 9%), and PMX205
was also more efficient than PMX53 at entering the intact CNS. In
comparison to other routes, subcutaneous administration of PMX205
resulted in high bioavailability (above 90%), as well as prolonged
plasma and CNS exposure. Finally, repeated daily oral or subcutaneous
administration of PMX205 demonstrated no accumulation of drug in blood,
the brain, or the spinal cord, promoting its safety for chronic dosing.
These results will be helpful in correlating the desired therapeutic
effects of these C5aR1 antagonists with their pharmacokinetic profile.
It also suggests that subcutaneous dosing of PMX205 may be an appropriate
route of administration for future clinical testing in neurological
disease.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The complement system
is a vital component of the immune system
that “complements” antibodies and phagocytic cells in
their ability to clear pathogens and respond to sterile injury. Once
stimulated by one of several triggers, it leads to a cascade of various
enzymatic sequences that generate opsonin, intermediate complement
“anaphylatoxin” peptides, and the terminal membrane
attack complex.1 The most potent inflammatory
complement fragment, C5a, exhibits various immunoregulatory and pro-inflammatory
biological activities2 by binding to two
known receptors, termed C5a receptor 1 (C5aR or CD88, now referred
to as C5aR1) and C5a receptor-like 2 (C5L2 or GPR77,
now referred to as C5aR2).3 On most cells, expression levels of C5aR1 are higher than C5aR2,
and its activation drives disease pathology, including diseases affecting
the CNS.2,4−7 The discovery and development of selective
C5aR1 inhibitors have therefore been an active area of research for
many decades.

Although there are several C5aR1-targeted therapeutics
in development
for various diseases,8 few have achieved
widespread use amongst researchers as compared to the class of cyclic
peptide C5aR1 inhibitors discovered at The University of Queensland
over 20 years ago. These well-studied inhibitors, Ac-Phe-[Orn-Pro-dCha-Trp-Arg]
(3D53 or PMX53)9 and hydrocinnamate-[Orn-Pro-dCha-Trp-Arg]
(PMX205),10 are cyclic peptide compounds
that act in a pseudo-irreversible and insurmountable manner at nanomolar
concentrations targeting complement C5aR1. PMX205 is a lipophilic
analogue of PMX53, with a substitution of a hydrocinnamate residue
for the extracylic phenylalanine residue. It is known to exhibit enhanced
efficacy and in vivo stability compared to its parent molecule PMX53.7,10−13 As such, PMX205 has been suggested as a more ideal drug candidate
for human disease, including neurological disorders. Indeed this drug
has shown beneficial effects in rodent models of striatal neurodegeneration,7 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,4,11 spinal
cord injury,5,14 and reduction of memory loss
in mice with Alzheimer’s disease.15,16 For more than 15 years, both antagonists have been used by multiple
laboratories in numerous experimental inflammatory conditions. Despite
being peptidic molecules, their cyclic nature enables them to demonstrate
a number of favorable properties required for clinical development
such as high receptor selectivity, nanomolar potency, stability, oral
bioavailability, and ability to cross neuroprotective barriers.7,17,18 Additionally, oral and topical
PMX53 has also successfully completed early phase I human clinical
trials, demonstrating the potential human safety of this class of
compounds.19

Despite the widespread
usage of these C5aR1 antagonists, only a
few studies have reported the quantitative pharmacokinetic determination
of these antagonists.6,12,20−22 A drawback to these prior pharmacokinetic studies
is that the time points collected were minimal and not sufficient
to observe a full pharmacokinetic profile to obtain accurate half-lives
and elimination values and various other pharmacokinetic parameters.
Furthermore, no prior study has performed tissue distribution studies
or correlated drug pharmacokinetics via different routes of administration.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to perform a complete
pharmacokinetic analysis of these antagonists in healthy mice via
various routes of drug administration, at the same dose, using a validated
bioanalytical quantitative LC–MS/MS method.13

2 Results
2.1 Pharmacokinetics of C5aR1
Antagonists in Wild-Type
Mice
PMX53 and PMX205 levels obtained from LC–MS/MS
analysis were corrected for process efficiency, extraction efficiency,
and recovery correction factors as described previously.13 Plasma concentration versus time profile data
obtained from raw data for both antagonists demonstrated a curvilinear
profile on a semi-log scale, a reflection that both antagonists undergo
fast distribution and elimination phases and are best fitted to a
two-compartment open model. The two-compartment pharmacokinetic model
of WINNONLIN was therefore utilized for calculation of the various
pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma, the brain, and the spinal cord
with the resulting data presented in Tables 1–3.

Fitness of the
pharmacokinetic model was assessed using in-built
diagnostics of WINNONLIN software, Akaike Information Criterion, and
by plotting the predicted curve as a function of time, with the observed
concentrations overlaid on the plot indicating close correlation of
the values (Figure 1). The concentration versus time profiles for PMX53 and PMX205 in
plasma (Figure 1A,B),
the brain (Figure 1C,D), and the spinal cord (Figure 1E,F) are shown following 1 mg/kg dosing via i.v., i.p.,
s.c., and p.o. routes of administration. Both PMX53 and PMX205 demonstrated
a rapid distribution in the plasma, followed by elimination after
i.v. dosing (Figure 1A,B). PMX205 had a shorter and faster distribution half-life and
slightly improved elimination half-life (1.51 and 19.33 min) compared
to PMX53 (3.49 and 14.73 min) following a single i.v. dose of 1 mg/kg,
which may be due to the more lipophilic nature of PMX205. This trend
was also observed in the brain (Figure 1C,D) and the spinal cord (Figure 1E,F). This is also reflected by shorter mean
residence time (MRT) values for PMX205 (Tables 2 and 3). Additionally,
brain and spinal cord elimination half-lives of PMX205 are shorter
compared to those of PMX53, again, likely due to the more lipophilic
nature of PMX205, supporting its increased permeability across blood–brain
and blood–spinal cord barriers.

antagonists in wild-type mice following a single drug dose. Mice were
administered a 1 mg/kg dose of PMX53 or PMX205 via intravenous (i.v.),
intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.), and per-oral (p.o.) routes.
The concentration vs time profiles in plasma [(A), PMX53 and (B) PMX205],
the brain [(C) PMX53 and (D) PMX205], and the spinal cord [(E) PMX53
and (F) PMX205] are shown. Dot points represent actual experimental
values, and continuous lines represent predicted values generated
by WINNONLIN (n = 4). Data are presented as mean
± SEM.

PMX53 peak plasma concentrations
of 4.92, 3.77, and 0.25 μg/mL
were observed at ∼14, ∼27, and ∼22 min via i.p.,
s.c., and p.o. routes of administration, respectively, at an administered
dose of 1 mg/kg. Additionally, infinity predicted plasma mean residence
times for PMX53 were ∼18, ∼36, ∼48, and ∼34
min following i.v., i.p., s.c., and p.o. routes, respectively. By
contrast, calculated peak concentrations of PMX205 in plasma were
∼5.95, ∼5.62, and ∼0.77 μg/mL as observed
at ∼14, ∼28, and ∼27 min via i.p., s.c., and
p.o. routes of administration, respectively, at an administered dose
of 1 mg/kg. For PMX205, the infinity predicted plasma mean residence
times were ∼37, ∼26, ∼64, and ∼54 min
following i.v., i.p., s.c., and p.o. routes, respectively. Peak brain
and spinal cord levels of the C5aR1 antagonists correlated with time
points of their corresponding plasma levels and were above their cellular
IC50 concentration (PMX53: 26 nM and PMX205: 31 nM10). Overall, brain and spinal cord elimination
half-lives of PMX53 were greater than those of PMX205 following i.v.
drug administration, suggesting greater brain retention of PMX205.

Bioavailability results (Table 4) indicate that the plasma bioavailability of PMX53
is ∼9% via the p.o. route and ∼68% via the i.p. route.
By comparison, PMX205 has better oral bioavailability of >20% following
p.o. dosing and an i.p. bioavailability of ∼60%. The s.c. bioavailability
of PMX205 is greater compared to PMX53 (∼96% compared with
∼85%, respectively). Additionally, the drug targeting efficiency
values of PMX53 and PMX205 as represented in Table 4 reflect the superior ability of PMX205 to
target brain and spinal cord tissues to that of PMX53.

2.2 Repeat
Dosing Pharmacokinetics of PMX205 in
Wild-Type Mice
For the repeat dosing pharmacokinetics and
accumulation studies, the lead clinical drug candidate, PMX205, was
selected. Two specific routes were chosen based upon the pharmacokinetic
profile of PMX205 (i.e. oral route and s.c. route). For the oral route,
PMX205 was administrated through drinking water. This route of administration
has been utilized by various groups to study the therapeutic benefit
of PMX205 in neurodegenerative disease mouse models where chronic
dosing is required.4,15,16 Five-day pharmacokinetic results from mice that were administered
PMX205 via the s.c. route (1 mg/kg) or via the drinking water (60
mg/L) are presented in Figure 2A,B, respectively. The results reveal that levels of PMX205
in plasma, the spinal cord, and the brain remain relatively unchanged
over the 5 day treatment protocol, suggesting that no accumulation
of compound occurs with this dosing regimen. After each 24 h interval,
the levels of circulating PMX205 in plasma were very low, as expected
from the predicted half-life of the acute dosing pharmacokinetic studies.
Despite this low circulating level of PMX205, brain and spinal cord
levels were comparatively higher. Importantly, the consistent and
maintained levels of PMX205 in the CNS tissue are above the cell-based
IC50 values for C5aR1 inhibition,10,12 indicating daily s.c. administration, or drinking water administration
of PMX205, is sufficient to block C5aR1 activation in the CNS.

Figure 2 Repeated dosing
pharmacokinetics of complement C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1)
antagonist PMX205 in wild-type mice. Mice were administered PMX205
daily via subcutaneous (s.c.) administration (1 mg/kg) or via drinking
water (60 mg/L) for 5 days. Drug levels in plasma, the brain, and
the spinal cord at each 24 h time point following administration are
shown for (A) the s.c. route and (B) drinking water
route. (C) PMX205 levels in the brain up to 120 h following a single

of n = 5 mice at each time point. Red dotted line
represents cellular IC50 of the drug (31 nM; equivalent
to ∼26 ng/mL) at the C5aR1.

Long-term pharmacokinetic studies were performed next to confirm
PMX205 duration in brain tissue following a single i.v. dose of the
compound over 120 h. Within the first 6 h of PMX205 administration,
there was a significant reduction in brain levels due to clearance,
and within 24 h, the majority of compounds that could produce any
therapeutic effect were eliminated from the brain (Figure 2C). The data support the absence
of any secondary uptake mechanisms that could lead to accumulation
of PMX205 in the brain following administration.

2.3 Excretion Studies of PMX205
Elimination
of PMX205 from mice was determined by calculating the amount of PMX205
excreted in an unchanged form through the urine or feces. Figure 3 illustrates that
most of the PMX205 is excreted unchanged and primarily within the
first 6 h following administration. Urinary excretion is the major
route of elimination as indicated by high levels of unchanged PMX205
in urine samples collected over the 48 hour duration following i.v.
administration (Figure 3A) and from the bladder just prior to euthanasia following p.o. administration
(Figure 3B). Following
i.v. administration, up to 46% of the PMX205 was excreted unchanged
through urine and up to 16% via feces within the first 24 h (Figure 3C,D). Given this
notable excretion of unchanged PMX205, we applied this to determine
the effective oral bioavailability, in addition to the AUC ratio.
Following equal amounts of compound administration, ∼4.2 ±
0.5 ng of detectable PMX205 was excreted out unchanged up to 90 min
following p.o. dosing and ∼20.7 ± 3.8 ng of PMX205 over
a period of 4 h after i.v. dosing. Accounting for these urinary excreted
unchanged levels of PMX205, a calculated oral absorption of ∼20%
was determined for PMX205.

3 Discussion
The cyclic
peptide complement C5aR1 antagonists, PMX53 and PMX205,
have been used extensively by various research groups in various species
including mice, rats,21 cats, dogs,23 and humans.24 Out
of all the species, studies have been performed most extensively in
mice, with >100 publications to date using these compounds for
a number
of diseases using a variety of administration routes in mice (e.g.,
i.v., s.c., i.p., p.o., drinking water, and others).4−6,25−48 Despite this plethora of mouse studies using these compounds, only
a few studies have performed pharmacokinetics, which are generally
limited in scope and only examining one route of administration.6,12,20−22 Furthermore,
pharmacodynamics and therapeutic effects of drugs are difficult to
correlate in the absence of pharmacokinetic data from various administration
routes within the same species.

Results from the pharmacokinetic
data performed in this study reveal
the biphasic decline in plasma concentrations of PMX53 and PMX205
with rapid distribution and elimination profiles of both antagonists.
Following i.v. administration of a single 1 mg/kg dose of either antagonist,
the highest concentration in plasma, the brain, and tissue was observed
after 2.5 min. Additionally, peak concentrations in CNS tissues corresponded
to the peak levels in circulation as reflected by various routes for
both antagonists. There was also rapid clearance of PMX205 from the
circulation following i.v. dosing, with most compounds excreted in
an unchanged form via urinary excretion. As expected, the plasma oral
bioavailability of both PMX53 and PMX205 is lower than that in parenteral
administration routes (∼10 and 20%, respectively), likely due
to poor gastric and intestinal stability due to their peptidic nature.13 Regardless, possibly due to the noncompetitive
and pseudo-irreversible antagonist nature of the compound class,12 oral dosing remains a viable mode of administration
for this drug class in mice.46

In
comparison to other routes of administration, the s.c. route
resulted in improved bioavailability and maintained levels of antagonists
in plasma, the brain, and the spinal cord for a longer duration, as
reflected by plasma MRT values, absorption half-lives, and elimination
half-lives. Drug targeting efficiency values, as calculated during
pharmacokinetic studies, are helpful in the selection of drug candidates
and routes of administration following comparative studies in the
healthy state. Maximum potential therapeutic effects can be achieved
in the disease state by administering drug candidates representing
better drug targeting efficiency values via a selected route. Based
on our data, the s.c. route represents the most viable route of administration
for future clinical application of PMX205. In support of the clinical
application of PMX205, repeat dosing (up to 5 days) and long-term
dosing pharmacokinetic studies for this drug indicated no accumulation
in the brain and spinal cord at the selected dose of 1 mg/kg and is
well tolerated.

One area of future investigation will be to
measure the “free”
fraction of the drug in plasma and the CNS, to be able to accurately
report the available concentrations of drug that could interact with
unbound C5aR1. In addition to free fraction determination studies,
future experiments are required to identify the rate, extent, and
half-life equilibrium in the CNS to obtain a greater understanding
of brain and spinal cord penetration and distribution of the antagonists.
Finally, further studies are yet to be performed to correlate the
drug availability with the length of duration in various non-CNS tissues.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, a pharmacokinetic analysis
of PMX53 and PMX205 was
completed in mice following various routes of administration using
a validated quantitative analysis method. The results demonstrate
that both PMX53 and PMX205 express a rapid distribution and elimination
profile, with renal excretion being the major route of elimination
following i.v. administration. Repeat dosing and long-term experiments
support the idea that PMX205 is well tolerated with no drug accumulation
with repeat daily dosing. This pharmacokinetic data will be beneficial
in correlating the drug therapeutic effects in mice with drug bioavailability
and drug tissue availability. The current data indicate that the s.c.
route of administration for PMX205 provides high bioavailability and
prolonged plasma concentrations, coupled with high blood–brain
barrier and blood-spinal cord barrier penetration, making this an
ideal route for neurological diseases and clinical application.

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 C5aR1 Antagonist Synthesis
C5aR1
cyclic peptidic antagonists were synthesized manually on 2-chlorotrityl
resin (1.0 mmol g–1, 0.25mmol scale) using Fmoc-based
solid-phase chemistry. Couplings were performed using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate
with diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF). Peptides were N-terminally acetylated
on resin by treatment with acetic anhydride (870 μL of acetic
anhydride and 470 μL of DIPEA in 15 mL of DMF) followed by cleavage
from the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA), triisopropylsilane, and water (95:2.5:2.5, 20 mL) for 1.5 h
at 23 °C. The TFA was removed in vacuo, and the peptide was precipitated
by addition of diethyl ether, collected by filtration, dissolved in
buffer A/B (50:50) (A: water with 0.05% TFA; B: 90% acetonitrile,
10% water with 0.045% TFA), and lyophilized. The crude peptide was
cyclized by dissolving the peptide in DMF (10 mM) with 5 equiv of
(benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate,
then 15 equiv of DIPEA was added, and the solution was stirred overnight
at 23 °C. The DMF was then removed in vacuo, and the residue
was redissolved in buffer A/B (50:50) and lyophilized. Peptides were
purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a C18 column (Phenomenex
Jupiter 300) using a gradient of 0–80% buffer B (in buffer
A) over 80 min with UV monitoring at 214 and 280 nm. Electrospray
mass spectroscopy confirmed the molecular mass of the peptide, and
analytical reverse-phase HPLC was used to analyze purity.

5.2 Chemicals and Reagents
Acetonitrile
(LC–MS grade), methanol (AR grade), and ethanol (AR grade)
were sourced from Ajax FineChem (Australia). Formic acid (optima LC–MS
grade) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (USA). Ultrapure deionized
water was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q water system (Millipore
MA, USA). PMX53 and PMX205 solutions (10 mg/mL) were prepared by dissolving
in sterile water for injection solution containing 5% ethanol and
stored at −20 °C. On the day of experimentation, the required
dose was prepared from drug stock in 5% dextrose in sterile water
for injection and brought to 37 °C before administering to animals.

5.3 Animals
Animal care and all experimental
procedures were performed following approval from the University of
Queensland Animal Care and Use Committee and conducted in accordance
with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia
policies and guidelines for the care and use of animals for scientific
purposes. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice (male, 10–12 weeks old) were
purchased from Animal Resources Centre, Western Australia. All animals
were housed within the University of Queensland Biological Resources
animal facility in a pathogen-free environment with a 12 h dark/light
cycle and free access ad libitum to food and water.

5.4 Pharmacokinetics of C5aR1 Antagonists
The pharmacokinetic
profiles of C5aR1 antagonists were assessed via
four routes of drug administration, that is, intravenous (i.v.; via
tail vein), subcutaneous (s.c.; over shoulders), intraperitoneal (i.p.),
and per-oral (p.o.; via oral gavage). Samples were collected and processed
for PMX53 and PMX205 determination using a validated LC–MS/MS
method as described previously.13 Briefly,
mice (n = 4) were anaesthetized with zolazepam (50
mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg) via i.p. injection. Anaesthetized mice
were administered 1 mg/kg drug solution through the selected route.
Blood samples were collected via a left ventricle cardiac puncture
using a syringe loaded with 20 μL of 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60,
and 90 min, and plasma was extracted by centrifugation at 4000 rpm
for 15 min at 4 °C. Following blood collection, mice were immediately
perfused transcardially with normal saline to remove drug from the
circulation in the brain and spinal cord. Whole brain and spinal cord
samples were obtained and homogenized in equal weight volume of milliQ
water. The tissue homogenate (100 μL) was mixed with 10 μL
of 1 μg/mL internal standard (PMX53 for PMX205 studies and PMX205
for PMX53 studies), vortexed, and deproteinized with 1:3 ice cold
LCMS-grade acetonitrile. Samples were sonicated followed by centrifugation
at 13,000 × g for 30 min for supernatant collection
and dried using a CentriVap sample concentrator at room temperature.
Samples were stored at −80 °C for LC–MS/MS analysis.
Plasma samples (50 μL) were also processed using the method
described above. On the day of analysis, samples were suspended in
50 μL of 75% methanol/water and 10 μL was analyzed through
a validated LC–MS/MS protocol.13

All the time points were terminal, and consequently, mean
drug concentrations per time point were used for pharmacokinetics
parameter determination using WINNONLIN software after suitable compartment
model selection. A model selection was supported by the vascular (i.v.
bolus) or extravascular (i.p., s.c., and p.o.) routes of drug administration.
The linear trapezoidal rule was applied for calculation of the area
under the curve (AUC) using the plasma concentration versus time profile
of C5aR1 antagonists. Each antagonist’s bioavailability was
determined by comparing the ratio of AUC values of each drug via each
specific route versus the AUC of the same antagonists via the i.v.
route. In addition to this, zero–infinity predicted AUC values
were also used to determine drug targeting efficiency. Higher drug
targeting efficiency values reflect superior targeting of the drug
to the specific tissue analysed49 and are
calculated as follows: 1   2   3  

5.5 Repeat Dosing Pharmacokinetics
of C5aR1 Antagonist
For the drinking water group, C57BL/6J
mice (n = 5) were kept in a controlled 12 h light/dark
cycle environment
for up to 5 days with free access to food and water containing 60
mg/L of PMX205. On days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, plasma and tissue samples
were collected 2 h after the start of the dark cycle. The amount of
water intake was monitored each day, and the total water consumption
was recorded at the end of the fifth experimental day. For the s.c.
route group, C57BL/6J mice (n = 5) were administered
PMX205 1 mg/kg s.c. daily at an interval of 24 h. Plasma and tissue
samples were collected for analysis on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Samples
were processed and analyzed for PMX205 levels using the LC–MS/MS.
For the single i.v. route, C57BL/6J mice (n = 4)
were dosed 1 mg/kg PMX205 i.v. and kept in metabolic cages (Tecniplast;
3600M021) for up to 120 h. Brain samples were collected at 0.04 (2.5
min), 6, 12, 2, 72, and 120 h. Samples were processed and analyzed
for PMX205 levels as described above.

5.6 Excretion
Studies of C5aR1 Antagonist
Excretion studies were performed
in metabolic cages using C57BL/6J
mice (n = 5). Mice were administered PMX205 (1 mg/kg)
i.v. and kept in metabolic cages for the duration of 48 h. Urine and
feces samples were collected at 4 h intervals and stored at −80
°C. For excretion studies following the p.o. route, mice were
administered 1 mg/kg PMX205 via oral gavage and samples were collected
at different time intervals from the urinary bladder prior to perfusion.
On the day of analysis, samples were process and analyzed using the
validated LC–MS/MS method.

5.7 Data
Analysis
All results are reported
as mean ± standard error of mean using GraphPad Prism (software
version 7.0, LaJolla, CA). Pharmacokinetics data analysis was performed
using Pharsight Phoenix WINNONLIN software (version 6.4), the industry
standard for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, analysis, and
simulation. A two-compartmental analysis method was used to obtain
various pharmacokinetic parameters. Figure 4A,B represents the model used for intravenous
drug administration and for all extravascular routes of drug administration
following a single dose of antagonists at 1 mg/kg. Fitness of the
pharmacokinetic model was assessed using the WINONLIN criterion and
by a graph plot of observed and predicted concentrations versus time.
Results are also expressed by graph plots of predicted concentration
values versus observed concentration values and changes of partial
derivatives with time with or without clearance parameters.
