Many natural materials
exhibit a multilayer structure in which
adjacent layers rotate in a helicoidal manner. The remarkable optical
and mechanical properties of these materials have motivated research
and development of man-made materials with similar morphology. Among
them, composite materials by cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and polymers
have attracted great interest; however, the relationship between the
cholesteric structure and the material properties is not well understood.
We used the composite CNC–polymer latex films with random,
stratified, and cholesteric morphologies, all with the same compositions,
to explore the effect of structure on the optical and mechanical properties
of the composite films. Films with a cholesteric structure exhibited
strong extinction, circular dichroism, and high stiffness; however,
they had lower toughness than the films with the cholesteric stratified
morphology. Films with disordered morphologies exhibited the highest
toughness and the lowest stiffness. These trends were attributed to
the confinement effects and the difference in polymer distribution
in the films. These results provide guidance for the preparation of
biomimetic cholesteric films with targeted optical and mechanical
properties.

Introduction
A common design motif
that is encountered in nature-derived materials
and systems, for example, plant tissues, algae, and crustacean cuticles,
is a multilayer structure in which adjacent layers rotate in a helicoidal
manner, similar to cholesteric liquid crystals. This structural paradigm
has recently gained strong interest in the materials science community
and motivated research on the development of nanocomposite materials
derived from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), crystalline rodlike nanoparticles
with a high mechanical strength and a versatile surface chemistry.1−3

A unique property of CNCs is their organization in cholesteric
(Ch) liquid crystalline structures in aqueous suspensions, when the
CNC volume fraction exceeds a critical value.4−6 The Ch morphology
is largely preserved in solid CNC films, which selectively interact
with circularly polarized light and are birefringent and iridescent,
that is, exhibit a photonic band gap. Promising applications of Ch–CNC
films include their use as humidity sensors,7 optical encryptors,8 structural pigments,9 light shutters,10 and
Ch templates for the synthesis of Ch inorganic materials.3,11,12

Because pristine Ch–CNC
films are brittle and exhibit high
propensity to crack, the energy-dissipating components such as water-soluble
polymers, for example, polyvinyl alcohol13 or poly(ethylene glycol),14 have been
added to the Ch–CNC films. An alternative approach included
the formation of composite Ch–CNC films from CNCs and soft
latex nanoparticles (NPs).4,15,16 Such films exhibited photonic properties, but they had significantly
enhanced toughness.16 Moreover, these films
had a stratified morphology, that is, they were composed of CNC-rich
Ch layers and polymer-rich disordered layers;4,15 however,
the relationship between the structure of these films and their optical
and mechanical properties remains elusive.

Because the morphology
of composite CNC-derived films is largely
predetermined by the state of the precursor suspension, it should
be possible to control the film structure by varying the methods of
film preparation.2 Generally, composite
Ch–CNC films are prepared by mixing an isotropic CNC suspension
with a desired additive, for example, a surfactant, a polymer, or
NPs, casting a liquid film and slowly evaporating the water to allow
for the formation of the Ch structure of the film.4,14,17−19 It has been established
that the layered film morphology (planar isotropic latex NP-rich layers
and CNC-rich Ch regions4,15) is the result of phase separation
in isotropic CNC/NP suspensions in the process that is driven by the
increase in free volume and translational entropy of the CNCs and
latex nanospheres.20,21

Alternatively, prior to
film casting, an isotropic latex NP–CNC
suspension can be allowed to equilibrate to achieve close-to-complete
phase separation into an isotropic NP-rich phase and a CNC-rich Ch
phase.16 The NP/Ch–CNC phase is
then separated and used to prepare a solid film under slow water evaporation
conditions to enable the Ch arrangement of the CNCs.16 In contrast, fast water evaporation from the isotropic
NP–CNC suspension can suppress the formation of the Ch phase
and yield amorphous films.2

Thus,
by using different methods of latex NP–CNC film preparation,
it is possible to change the film structure without changing its composition,
and in this manner, examine the role of film morphology on its optical
and mechanical properties. In addition, understanding of the advantages
and limitations of each method may lead to a more time-efficient film
preparation process.

Here, we report the results of comparative
experimental studies
of the relationship between the structure, optical properties, and
mechanical performance of latex NP–CNC films with the same
composition but different morphologies. Composite Ch–CNC films
comprising latex NPs were prepared from a mixed suspension of CNCs,
latex NPs with low glass-transition temperature, Tg, and hexanediamine acting as a cross-linker of the NPs.
Partitioning of the NPs in the Ch–CNC regions resulted in an
increase in the Ch pitch of the films and a greater film uniformity.
These films had excellent photonic properties and exhibited a ∼50%
increase in stiffness and a ∼73% decrease in toughness, in
comparison with disordered NP–CNC films with the same composition.
In contrast, NP–CNC films with a disordered morphology had
higher toughness and lower stiffness, and as expected, did not possess
photonic properties. Stratified NP/Ch–CNC films had optical
and mechanical properties that were intermediate between those of
the disordered and perfectly ordered NP/Ch–CNC films.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Cellulose Nanocrystals
A 12.2 wt
% aqueous suspension
of CNCs was purchased from the University of Maine Process Development
Centre. A portion of this suspension was decanted into a 1 L Nalgene
bottle, diluted to 9 wt %, and stored at 4 °C.

Latex Nanoparticles
Butyl acrylate (BuA, ≥99%),
9-vinyl anthracene (VA, 97%), 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl acetoacetate
(MAEAA, 95%), potassium persulphate (KPS, ≥99%), hexamethylene
diamine (HDA, 98%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 92.5–100.5%),
dialysis tubing (cellulose, 12–14 kD), and activated aluminum
oxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Canada. BuA was distilled
at 60 °C under vacuum before use and MAEAA was filtered using
an aluminum oxide column. Latex NPs were synthesized by emulsion polymerization22 by copolymerizing BuA (12.83 mL, 89.5 mol %),
MAEAA (1.91 mL, 10 mol %), and VA (0.10 g, 0.05 mol %) under nitrogen
atmosphere in 55 mL of water at 80 °C using SDS (0.11 g) as a
surfactant and KPS (0.14 g) as the initiator. The details of latex
NP synthesis are provided in the Supporting Information. Following latex synthesis, the dispersion was cooled down to room
temperature and filtered using Whatman filter paper. After filtration,
the dispersion of latex NPs was purified by dialysis against deionized
water, with water change daily for 7 days.

The hydrodynamic
radius and the electrophoretic mobility of latex NPs were characterized
using Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS. The glass-transition temperature, Tg, of latex NPs in cross-linked CNC-free films
was determined under a nitrogen atmosphere using a differential scanning
calorimeter (DSC) model Q100 (TA Instruments). Dynamic DSC measurements
were carried out at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min in the temperature
range of −75 to 100 °C. The cross-linking of NPs with
HDA was characterized by ATR-FTIR as described elsewhere.16

Film Preparation
Film Preparation from the
NP/Ch–CNC Suspension (EQU)
A mixed aqueous suspension
(45 g) contained CNCs (5 wt %), latex
NPs (1.67 wt %), and HDA (3.8 mM), with HDA added last. The mixed
suspension was vortex-mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 7 days.
Two 3 mL portions of the bottom NP/Ch–CNC phase were cast into
two 60 × 15 mm2 polystyrene Petri dishes. Composite
films formed at 28 °C and relative humidity (RH) of ∼70%
for 10 days and were stored in a 70% RH environment prior to film
characterization.

The concentration of latex NPs in the Ch phase
in the EQU suspensions was determined using fluorescence spectroscopy
(Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer, Varian) at the excitation
wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 411 nm in a 10 ×
10 × 30 mm3 quartz cuvette. Calibration standards
were prepared by 100-fold dilution of the mixed suspensions at a CNC
concentration of 5 wt % and latex NP concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, 1,
2, and 5 wt %.

Film Preparation from the Isotropic NP–CNC
Suspension
(PAR)
A mixed aqueous suspension (6 mL) contained CNCs (5
wt %), NPs (0.7 wt %), and HDA (3.8 mM), with HDA added last. The
mixed suspension was vortex-mixed. Two 3 mL portions of the suspension
were cast into two 60 × 15 mm2 polystyrene Petri dishes.
Composite films were formed at 28 °C and RH of 70% for 10 days
and were stored in a 70% RH environment prior to film characterization.

Preparation of Isotropic NP–CNC Films (ISO)
A mixed
aqueous suspension (6 mL) contained CNCs (5 wt %), NPs (0.7
wt %), and HDA (3.8 mM), with HDA added last. The suspension was vortex-mixed
and two 3 mL portions of the suspension were cast into two 60 ×
15 mm2 polystyrene Petri dishes. Composite films were formed
at 25 °C and RH of 16% overnight and were stored in a 70% RH
environment prior to film characterization.

Film Characterization
Extinction spectra of the composite
films were acquired using Varian Cary 5000 ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared
spectrophotometer. The films were placed orthogonally to the incident
beam path. The measurements were taken at five different locations
within the central 1 cm diameter region of the film in the spectral
range from 400 to 900 nm. A Jasco-810 Spectropolarimeter was used
to characterize the circular dichroism (CD) of the composite films.
A film area of 6 mm2 cut from the central region of the
composite film was placed orthogonally to the beam path and analyzed
in a spectral range from 400 to 850 nm at a scan speed of 100 nm/min
with a 4 s response time.

Static-force tensile strength tests
were conducted using a TA Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis instrument
(TA Instruments). Prior to the measurements, the films were maintained
at room temperature and a relative humidity of 70% for 7 days. Films
were cut into 30 × 2 mm2 strips for analysis and clamped
at each end. The films were tested at 25 °C with 3 N/min ramp.
The tensile stress was calculated as force per unit area of film cross
section (the dimensions of the film were measured with a caliper with
a precision of ±0.02 mm). Young’s modulus of the films
was calculated as the slope of the linear portion of the tensile stress/strain
curve, measured by TA Universal Analysis software. The tensile strength
was determined as the ultimate strength of the film before failure
and the modulus of toughness was determined as the area under the
corresponding stress/strain curve. For each composition, at least
four films were tested.

To examine the structure of the cross-sectional
area of the composite
films, a scanning electron microscope equipped with a QUANTA field
emission gun 250 and a bright field/dark field scanning transmission
electron microscope detector was used at a sample temperature of −22
°C. Prior to imaging, the films were freeze-fractured under liquid
nitrogen and subsequently coated with 10 nm thick gold film. The samples
for the analysis of the cross-sectional fracture surface were gold-coated
immediately after breaking and imaged under the same conditions.

Results
Latex Nanoparticles
Latex NPs had an average hydrodynamic
diameter and electrokinetic potential (ζ potential) of 47 ±
6 nm and −48 ± 8 mV, respectively. The Tg of the cross-linked NPs was −8 °C. We stress
that the utilization of negatively charged latex NPs was important
because the electrostatic interactions between negatively charged
CNCs and positively charged latex NPs resulted in the formation of
an isotropic colloidal gel.

Film Fabrication
Figure 1 illustrates the methods of
latex NP/Ch–CNC
film preparation. The ISO films were prepared by mixing an isotropic
CNC suspension with latex NPs and hexanediamine (HDA), immediately
casting a liquid film and overnight drying at RH of 16% (Figure 1, top row). The rationale
was that rapid film formation should suppress the Ch organization
of the CNCs. In the PAR method (Figure 1, medium row), a mixed isotropic suspension of CNCs,
latex NPs, and HDA was cast as a liquid film and dried at 70% RH for
10 days. We expected that during this time, the latex NP–CNC
suspension will phase separate into a CNC-rich Ch regions and isotropic
NP-rich layers. In the EQU method, a mixed isotropic suspension of
CNCs, latex NPs, and HDA was equilibrated for 7 days to achieve a
close-to-complete phase separation into the isotropic NP-rich top
phase and the CNC-rich Ch bottom phase. The bottom NP/Ch–CNC
phase was then separated, cast as a liquid film, and dried at 70%
RH for 10 days. For such films, we expected the highest degree of
the Ch order and the least phase separation.

and EQU films.

Table 1 summarizes
the compositions and the conditions of film preparation. Importantly,
all of the films studied in the present work had the same composition.
Because in EQU films, only 39% of the latex NPs partition into the
Ch–CNC phase,16 the concentration
of latex NPs in the original NP–CNC suspension was increased
to 1.67 wt %. The film thickness decreased from the ISO to PAR to
EQU films.

a In EQU films, the
concentration
of CNCs could be ∼0.2% higher because the Ch–CNC phase
has a higher content of CNCs than the isotropic phase.5

Figure 2 shows the
representative photographs of the ISO, PAR, and EQU films. In contrast
with pristine Ch–CNC films, the composite films were flexible
and not prone to cracking. The PAR and EQU films exhibited structural
green and red colors, respectively, suggesting a Ch periodicity in
the CNC arrangement.2 The lack of color
for the ISO films indicated that they were isotropic.

latex NP–CNC films prepared

Film Structure
The morphology of the cross section
of the composite films was examined using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Figure 3 shows
the representative structures of the ISO, PAR, and EQU films. No Ch
structure or NP-rich regions was observed for the ISO films (Figure 3, top). The EQU films
had a close-to-perfect periodic layered structure that was characteristic
of a Ch–CNC phase and a very few planar isotropic NP-rich regions.
The PAR films (Figure 3, middle) had the morphology that resembled that of both the EQU
and ISO films: the Ch–CNC regions and a large fraction of disordered
regions, both aligned in the plane of the film. Few NP-rich domains
were observed in the PAR films at the interface between the Ch regions
and the NP-rich domains, which were aligned in the film plane. The
average pitch of the Ch regions in the PAR films was P ≈ 170 nm, in comparison with ∼300 nm measured for
the EQU films. A greater P value of the EQU films
suggested a greater NP inclusion within the Ch–CNC regions,
thereby increasing the inter-CNC distance.

Optical Properties of the Composite Films
The optical
properties of the composite NP–CNC films were analyzed by ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Figure 4 shows the UV–vis
and CD spectra of the composite films. An extinction peak (a stop
band) was observed for the PAR and EQU films (Figure 4a). The periodicity of the Ch structure resulted
in Bragg’s diffraction according to the equation 1  

Figure 4 UV–vis

A minimum of four measurements were taken within the central 1 cm2 area of each film.

where the reflected wavelength of light, λ, is proportional
to the spacing d (equal to the half-pitch, P/2), and θ is the angle of incidence of light. Because
the EQU and PAR films had the same composition and thus the same average
refractive index n, the red shift for the EQU films
resulted from a larger P, which also explained the
difference in structural colors of the EQU and PAR films (Figure 2). Furthermore, the
bandwidth at half-height of the extinction peak of the EQU films was
8 nm narrower than that of the PAR films, suggesting an enhanced control
of the Ch pitch throughout the EQU films. The ISO films did not exhibit
any extinction peaks because these films lacked the Ch structure,
consistent with the absence of the structural color (Figure 2).

Similarly, in Figure 4b, the CD spectra
of EQU and PAR films exhibited a CD peak, consistent
with the left-handed Ch structure of the films.23,24 The width at half height of the EQU peak was 5 nm smaller than that
of the PAR film. Additionally, the EQU film peak was redshifted and
exhibited a higher intensity comparing to the PAR peak.

We note
that a second small, broad peak appeared in the EQU and
PAR spectra toward the red end of the CD spectra. This peak could
reflect the existence of larger-pitch regions in the composite film;
however, this effect is under investigation.

Mechanical Properties of
the Composite Films
Next,
we examined the mechanical properties of the ISO, PAR, and EQU films
by tensile tests. The stress–strain curves of the EQU and PAR
films revealed a more brittle failure characteristic, with a lower
strain value and a less pronounced plastic region than the ISO films
(Figure 5). The fracture
surface (the path of crack propagation) in the cross section of the
EQU films featured distinctive, stepwise cleavage of the Ch–CNC
layers (Figure 5, top
inset). In contrast, the fracture surface in the cross section of
the ISO films (Figure 5, bottom inset) displayed a random distribution of deep valleys and
protrusions, that is, the crack path was less defined due to a higher
plastic deformation in these films.

Figure 5 Representative tensile stress–strain
curves for EQU, PAR,
and ISO films. Insets: SEM images of the cross-sectional fracture
surface for EQU (top) and ISO (bottom) films. Scale bars are 2 μm.

Figure 6 shows the
summary of the mechanical properties of EQU, PAR, and ISO films. Young’s
modulus, E, calculated as the slope of the linear
section of the tensile stress–strain curve in Figure 5, was significantly higher
for the EQU and PAR films than for the ISO films (p < 0.001, EQU = PAR > ISO). More specifically, 57 and 39% higher E values were measured for the EQU and PAR films, respectively,
in comparison with the ISO films. The variation in the modulus of
toughness, MT, determined as the total
area under the tensile stress–strain curve before film fracture,25 showed a trend opposite to the variation in E for the EQU, PAR, and ISO films, with an overall decrease
of ∼78% from ISO to EQU films (p < 0.001,
EQU = PAR < ISO). We note that the glass-transition temperature, Tg, of the latex polymer in the EQU and ISO films
was −18.2 and −20.25 °C, respectively.

Figure 6 Mechanical
properties of ISO, PAR, and EQU films. Young’s
modulus, E, is shown on the left y axis. The modulus of toughness, MT,
and the tensile strength, σ, are shown on the right y axis. Statistical analysis was performed using Sigmaplot
version 12 (Systat Software Inc., CA) for one-way ANOVA and Tukey
tests.

The tensile strength, σ,
calculated as the applied stress
when the film failed, reduced by 15% from the EQU to the ISO films;
however, a high standard deviation resulted in no statistically significant
difference (p = 0.581) among the composite films.
Notably, the PAR films had intermediate values of E, MT, and σ, in comparison with
the EQU and ISO films.

Discussion
The method of preparation
of the ISO, PAR, and EQU films has a
prominent effect on their morphology. As shown in Figure 3, the ISO films had a disordered
structure, with the soft latex NPs uniformly distributed throughout
the film. The lack of order in these films resulted in their featureless
extinction and the CD spectra in the spectral range from 400 to 600
nm. The EQU films had a highly ordered, periodic Ch structure. Most
of the latex NPs resided within the Ch–CNC layers, thereby
increasing the pitch of the Ch structure. The PAR films exhibited
a morphology that combined the features of the ISO and EQU films:
the Ch regions alternated with disordered planar layers. Latex NPs
resided mostly in the disordered CNC regions and isotropic, latex
NP-rich layers. We note that the partition of additives in the defects
of topological liquid crystalline materials is a well-established
effect.5

A close-to-perfect Ch structure
and an increased pitch of the EQU
films resulted in a reduced width at half-height and red shift of
the extinction and CD peaks in the corresponding spectra in comparison
with the PAR films. Thus, the spectra of the EQU and PAR films correlated
with the film morphology.

The thickness of the composite films
decreased with an increasing
fraction of the Ch regions from ISO to PAR to EQU films owing to the
higher density of the crystalline domains.20 Even though the Ch pitch was smaller in the PAR film than in the
EQU films, the contribution of the isotropic regions of the films
was prevalent and governed the variation in the film thickness.

Because all of the films had an identical composition, the significant
difference in their mechanical properties was a consequence of the
differences in the film structure. The morphology and mechanical properties
of the PAR films were intermediate between the structures and properties
of the ISO and EQU films; thus, in the discussion in the following
section, we focus on the properties of the ISO and EQU films.

A significantly higher value of Young’s modulus, E, of the EQU films than of the ISO films was attributed
to the Ch–CNC structure of the EQU films. In the EQU films,
the CNCs were packed into ordered Ch–CNC regions, leading to
a reduction in the film thickness and thus the film densification
compared with the ISO films (Table 1). An increased density resulted in a stiffer material
and an increased E. In addition, in the EQU films,
the latex NPs were mostly confined between the Ch–CNC layers.
The confinement between the solid surfaces restricted the polymer
chain mobility (that led to a high Tg)
and lowered the extent of the polymer collective movement, in agreement
with earlier work,13 thus increasing the
apparent stiffness of the confined latex NPs. The ISO films had a
lower density and a limited NP confinement between CNCs, which resulted
in a lower E.

The lower value of MT for the EQU films,
relative to the ISO films, stemmed from the weaker inelastic deformation
of the latex NPs confined between the Ch–CNC layers in the
EQU films, thereby making these films less ductile. Confinement of
the latex NPs within the Ch–CNC layers in the EQU films resulted
in a lower effective MT of the polymer,
and thus reduced the toughness of the composite EQU film. In the ISO
films, the latex NPs were randomly distributed between the individual
CNC crystals, thus undergoing a significantly larger deformation than
in the EQU films, that is, a larger strain at the fracture.

Generally, the tensile strength, σ, is highly sensitive to
the existing weak spots that are prone to failure initiation. Therefore,
any structural flaw, whether due to CNC or latex or the CNC/latex
interface, would have a strong influence on the σ value. It
could be expected that in the ISO films, the larger plastic deformation
of the latex polymer could have contributed in lowering the overall
tendency for crack initiation in the film, thereby leading to a higher
average σ. Nevertheless, unlike E and MT, the difference in the tensile strength, σ,
was not statistically significant among the three types of films.

Conclusions
We report our findings on the relationship between the structure
of the composite CNC–latex films and their optical and mechanical
properties. For the CNC–latex films with the same composition,
the variation in morphology was achieved by using different methods
of film preparation. The film formation from the equilibrated NP-loaded
Ch–CNC suspension yielded EQU films with a close-to-perfect
Ch structure and latex NPs embedded between the Ch–CNC layers.
Fast drying of an unequillibrated CNC–NP suspension yielded
disordered ISO films, whereas slow drying of the same suspension resulted
in stratified PAR films comprising the Ch–CNC regions and the
NP-rich disordered planar layers. Due to the latex NPs confined between
the Ch–CNC layers, the EQU films had a larger Ch pitch and
red-shifted extinction and CD peaks in comparison with the PAR films.

The morphology of the films had a strong effect on their mechanical
properties. High stiffness and reduced toughness of the EQU films
was ascribed to the restricted deformation of the latex polymer due
to its confinement between the Ch–CNC layers. Isotropic latex–CNC
films, by contrast, had lower stiffness and increased toughness. The
PAR films had the morphology and the mechanical properties that were
intermediate between those of the ISO and EQU films.

This study
demonstrates the impact of film microstructure on their
optical and mechanical properties and provides guidelines for the
design and preparation of nanocomposite films with tailored properties.
