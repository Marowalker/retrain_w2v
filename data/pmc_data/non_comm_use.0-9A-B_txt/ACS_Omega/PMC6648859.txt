This
work prepared a type of diblock copolymer with thermo- and
photosensitivity in ionic liquids (ILs). P(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (compatible with ILs) was prepared
as one segment, while butyl acrylate (BA) and 4-phenylazophenylmethacrylate
(AzoMA) were copolymerized as another segment P(AzoMA-r-BA) with stimuli responsiveness. The diblock copolymer showed tunable
lower critical micellization temperature (LCMT) in two mixed imidazole
ionic liquids. The value of LCMT depends on not only the conformation
status of the azo group in copolymers but also the azo group content
in copolymers and mixed ratio of ionic liquids. Based on this tunable
LCMT, photoinduced micellization/demicellization can be achieved near
room temperature by alternate irradiation with visible and ultraviolet
light, and it is totally reversible.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ionic
liquid (IL) refers to a liquid composed of ions or ionic
pairs, such as KCl or KOH at high temperatures. Among them, room-temperature
ILs caused by the loose structure of anion and cation have aroused
great concern of scientists because of their physical and chemical
properties. The commonality of these properties, such as nonvolatility,
wide potential window, nonburning property, and wide electrochemical
stability,1−6 have a wide range of applications starting from their use as green
solvents in organic synthesis and a gas separation membrane, to electrodes
in batteries, and so on.7−10 ILs show excellent properties in the fabrication
of functional soft materials because of their good compatibility with
certain synthetic polymers.11,12 It was reported that,
there is a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) caused by the
interaction between poly(benzylmethacrylate) (PBnMA) and a specific
IL,13 which was first demonstrated in pure
water by using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm).14 In addition, the modified PBnMA would show different
properties, for example, the polymer modified by nitration showed
no phase behavior in ILs.15 Now, the polymers
like polyacrylate16 or poly(ethylene oxide)17,18 are all proved to have ability in presenting the behavior of phase
change in ILs with a special performance. When the light-responsive
group AzoMA was introduced into a thermoresponsive polymer, the phase
separation may be controlled by temperature and light source at the
same time.19

Block copolymers, also
known as the mosaic copolymer, is a specific
polymer synthesized by joining together two or more polymer segments
of different properties. In ILs, they can be self-assembled into different
morphologies at low concentration, such as sphere, vesicle, or wormlike
micelle, which has been directly observed from cryo-transmission electron
microscopy (TEM).20 In addition, it was
reported the thermoresponsive assembly and disassembly of block copolymers
contain PNIPAm or PBnMA in ILs, where the PNIPAm showed upper critical
solution temperature (UCST).21,22 Once the azo-containing
agents were copolymerized with the UCST-type polymer as one segment
in the block copolymer, they would show the behavior of thermo- and
photosensitive assembly in ILs.23,24 These block copolymers
showed different upper critical micellization temperature in ILs when
the light source was switched between visible light and ultraviolet
light. As to the system with lower critical micellization temperature
(LCMT) in ILs, very recently, Hall and Lodge reported a photoresponsive
block copolymer in concentrated conditions that underwent the reversible
order–disorder transition with the action of the AzoMA-PBnMA
system and expanded the area of thermo- and photoresponsive materials.25 Although there are many studies of light-induced
micellization based on the PBnMA or PNIPAm in the IL, the temperature
for unimer–micelle transition is usually too high, which will
restrict their practical use in most cases. Lodge and co-workers found
that the LCST of poly(butyl acrylate) can be adjusted to a temperature
range from room temperature to more than 200 °C by simply using
blends of different imidazole ILs with different lengths of alkyl.16 According to this, we aimed to realize the photoinduced
micellization near room temperature.

Herein, a series of AB-type
diblock copolymers consisted of poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA: compatible
with ILs) as A block and poly(AzoMA-r-butyl acrylate)
(P(AzoMA-r-BA): temperature- and photosensitive polymer
in ILs) as B block were synthesized by two-step reversible addition–fragmentation
chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of AzoMA and butyl acrylate
(BA), initiating from the ends of the initiator attached to the PDMA.
The PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) copolymers
were evidenced to exhibit LCMT transition in ILs mixture, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis (trifluoromethane sulfone) imide ([C2mim][NTf2]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethanesulfone)imide
([C4mim][NTf2]) by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements. The LCMT of the diblock copolymer can be altered
by different photoisomerization states of AzoMA and its value when
excited by ultraviolet light was generally higher than that of the
block copolymer with stable trans-azo. Also, the
value of LCMT for PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) can be readily tuned by changing composition of IL mixture.
At the intermediate temperature between both LCMTs mentioned above,
the self-assembly and disassembly can be controlled by changing the
light source. The recoverability of the light-induced micellization
was further demonstrated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
BA, 1,4-dioxane, N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA), diethyl ether,
and hexane were purchased from Aladdin. DMA and BA were purified by
passing through alumina column. [C2mim][NTf2] and [C4mim][NTf2] were purchased from Lan
Zhou Green Chem. 2-(Dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic
acid (CTA) was prepared by the method in published papers.26,27 AzoMA was prepared according to the information from the previous
study.28,29 2,2′-Azobis (isobutyronitrile) (AIBN)
was refined by recrystallization from methanol and dried under vacuum
before using. The remaining agents were used directly.

2.2 Synthesis of the PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) Diblock Copolymer
Scheme 1 illustrated the typical process of synthesizing
the relevant diblock copolymer via RAFT polymerization. A mixture
of DMA (6.00 g, 0.060 mol), CTA (0.10 g, 0.30 mmol), and AIBN (9.8
mg, 0.06 mmol) was mixed with the 1,4-dioxane (24.00 g) in a reaction
tube filled with the N2 atmosphere. After the solid agents
were totally dissolved in the solvents, the reaction tube was heated
at 65 °C for 4 h. Then, the mixture was cooled down to low temperature
and dropped into diethyl ether (poor solvent for the block copolymer)
to precipitate. Using acetone as good solvent, reprecipitations were
conducted three times to refine the crude product to obtain the PDMA-CTA
(as A block).

Scheme 1 Preparation Route for PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) Diblock Copolymer
Then, P(AzoMA-r-BA) (as B block) was
polymerized
at the end of the PDMA-CTA. Here, PDMA-CTA (1.00 g, 0.08 mol), BA
(5.52 g, 0.043 mol), and AzoMA (0.45 g, 1.70 mmol) were first dissolved
in a reaction tube filled with inert gas. For the accuracy of weighing,
AIBN (0.016 g, 0.10 mmol) was diluted using 10 mL of 1,4-dioxane,
then, 1 mL of AIBN solution was extracted and injected to the reaction
tube. The reaction was then conducted at 65 °C for 24 h. Similar
to the purification of PDMA-CTA, the crude product here was also refined
by three times reprecipitation using acetone to redissolve the polymer
and hexane to precipitate.

The last step aimed to remove the
active trithiocarbonate of each
molecular chain. The relevant operation was conducted as follows:
the diblock copolymer containing RAFT agent (2.00 g), AIBN (0.42 g)
and 1,4-dioxane (50 mL) were directly mixed in a reaction tube filled
with inert atmosphere. Then, the reaction tube was heated at 80 °C
for 12 h. Apart from the identical purification procedure above, the
obtained product was further purified by fractional precipitation.
The product precipitated from hexane was mixed with methanol at a
concentration of 5%. Then, the mixtures were placed in a low-temperature
environment for several days. After filtering out the very little
impurities, the product was collected again by precipitating in the
hexane. The ultimate products were dried and showed a state of rubbery
then.

2.3 Preparation of ILs Mixture Solution Containing
Diblock Copolymer
The viscosity of [C2mim][NTf2] or [C4mim][NTf2] is usually too high
and it is difficult for the diblock copolymer to dissolve immediately.
Therefore, the IL solution containing the diblock copolymer was prepared
using the co-solvent methods. In a small screw bottle, a small amount
of tetrahydrofuran (THF) was used to dissolve the diblock copolymer
with constant stirring. When the solution was totally clear, a certain
composition of [C2mim][NTf2] and [C4mim][NTf2] was added into the mixture. Then, the THF would
be evaporated slowly when the uniform mixture was obtained. It is
noted that the 0.22 μm organic filter should be always used
to filter the small particles in order to reduce the mistakes that
may happen.

2.4 Size Exclusion Chromatography
Measurements
and 1H NMR Measurements
Size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) and 1H NMR measurements are two main means to investigate
the structure of the block copolymer. The SEC here was corrected by
the universal calibration curve using ten narrowly distributed polystyrene
standards. 1H NMR was obtained using Bruker AVANCE III
(600 MHz).

2.5 DLS Tests
The
particle size and distribution
in ILs were investigated by DLS tests. By controlling the temperature
with an error no larger than 0.1 °C, the LCMT can be defined
from the temperature dependence of size curves. The samples in the
quartz cell (to avoid the absorption of ultraviolet light) should
be kept for sufficient time to maintain a balanced state once the
temperature is tuned slightly. Both visible light (>400 nm, 4 mW/cm2) and ultraviolet light (365 nm, 8 mW/cm2) sources
are light-emitting diode cold light sources in order to avoid the
heat generated by the lamp. It is noted that the particle size determined
by DLS refers to the hydrodynamic radius that is calculated from electric
field correlation function by relevant equations (Stokes–Einstein
equation, method of Cumulants, etc.) whenever in monodisperse solutions
or polydisperse solutions.30

2.6 UV–Vis Measurements
The photo-reversible
transition of the azo group from trans to cis in the diblock copolymer
was demonstrated by UV–vis measurements. In order to obtain
a spectrum with reasonable absorbance, the contents of the diblock
copolymer in ILs was set as 0.13 g/L.

2.7 TEM Measurements
The TEM observation
was operated on JEM-1400 at 80 kV. In order to reduce the blocking
effect of ILs on electrons, THF was used to dilute the sample to a
proper concentration, then, a droplet of dispersion was placed onto
a copper grid without the staining agent, and the THF residue was
evaporated at 70 °C for an hour before measurements.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization Results
of the Diblock Copolymer
The molecular weight of the polymer
was determined both by SEC
and 1H NMR. The content of AzoMA in diblock copolymers
is determined from integrated signal ratio of 1H NMR spectra. Figures 1 and S1 showed a typical 1H NMR and SEC
traces of the block copolymer, respectively, according to which the
characterization results are summarized and shown in Table 1. It is noted that the molecular
weight and polydispersity index of homopolymer PDMA were determined
by SEC in the first place. Based on the Mn of PDMA,
the Mn of the block copolymer was determined by comparing
the integrated signals from the BA (d) and AzoMA (a) with that of
peaks (e) from the DMA in the 1H NMR spectrum. The SEC
profiles of polymers were unimodal, however, the dispersity index
of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) in Table 1 was larger than that
of PDMA, that is because the azobenzene has the effect of preventing
radical polymerization to a certain degree.31 The content of AzoMA in diblock copolymers was calculated by comparing
the integrated signals from AzoMA (a) and signals from the BA (d).
In addition, the reagents required for the relevant reaction were
characterized by 1H NMR (see Figures S2–S4)

(ρPDMA = 1.096 ρP(AzoMA-r-BA) = 1.094).

As Figure 2 shows,
there are two distinct peaks located at 320 and 430 nm, respectively.
One peak is caused by the π–π* transition of outer
electron from trans-AzoMA, the other is caused by
the n−π* transition of outer electron from cis-AzoMA. Under UV irradiation, the absorption at 320 nm showed an
obvious decrease, and the absorption at 430 nm coming from the n−π*
transition of cis-AzoMA continued to increase at
the same time, indicating AzoMA had undergone the trans to cis isomerization change. This process took
almost 180 s to reach the steady state. After visible light irradiation,
the peaks around 320 nm showed a distinct increase, suggesting cis-AzoMA had recovered to trans-AzoMA.
In the meantime, the absorption at 430 nm recovered to the initial
state too, and it took almost 160 s to complete this transition. It
is obvious that the photoisomerization reaction of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) in ILs is reversible.

3.2 DLS Characterization and TEM Imaging of the
Micelle
Critical micelle concentration (cmc) was determined
by DLS measurement of a series of different concentration of solutions
of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in [C2mim][NTf2] (Figure S5). It was found that the cmc was 0.2 wt %. Therefore,
the sample of 1 wt % solution of the diblock copolymer in IL was chosen
as an example to conduct the following characterization. Figure 3 shows the correlation
functions for 1 wt % solutions of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in ILs mixture ([C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/2.5 by weight) with
different temperatures. Hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and dispersity index of the particles were obtained from Figure 3 according to the
intrinsic equation and shown in Table 2, in which there are two different Rhs when the temperature is below 38 °C. The smaller Rh peak (<10 nm) indicates the hydrodynamic
radius of molecular chain itself with molecular weight near 32 kDa,
and the peak over 100 nm shows that there are some aggregates that
cannot be ignored. The higher dispersity index (>0.2) of particles
at low temperatures also indicates the coexistence of smaller particles
and larger particles. Figure S6a,b show
the intensity distribution and volume distribution of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in ILs mixture
([C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/2.5 by weight) at 32 °C, respectively. The intensity distribution
function was bimodal, however, volume distribution function was unimodal,
suggesting an amount of the unimers are dominated. The formation of
these aggregates is mainly caused by two reasons. The first is possibly
the irregular composition of comonomers caused by the random copolymerization,
and the second may be the that there are small amounts of macromolecules
with very high molecular weight owing to the nonliving polymerization.
When the temperature was increased to 36 °C, the phenomenon of
coexistence of smaller particles and larger particles still existed.
However, both the intensity distribution function and volume distribution
function were bimodal (Figure S7), demonstrating
parts of unimers had aggregated into micelles.

40	 	182.5	0.031	
42	 	199.6	0.013	
When the temperatures
were elevated above 38 °C, only one Rh of the particles is shown in Table 2, there was only one peak larger
than 160 nm and the peak corresponding to the molecular chain was
completely gone in both intensity distribution and volume distribution
of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in ILs mixture ([C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/2.5 by weight) at 42 °C (Figure S8a,b). This indicated that unimers had
aggregated into micelles. The lower dispersity index (<0.032) of
micelles at high temperatures also demonstrated the formation of micelles.
The Rhs of the micelles at higher temperatures
are >160 nm, suggesting possible formation of a bilayer vesicle
or
worm-like micelle. In this paper, formation of the bilayer vesicle
was proved by TEM images of a 1 wt % solutions of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in [C2mim][NTf2] (because LCMT of 1 wt % solutions of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in [C2mim][NTf2] is lower than room temperature, 1 wt % solutions of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in the [C2mim][NTf2] system was selected to conduct TEM)
in Figure 4.

3.3 Thermoresponsive Micellization/Demicellization
of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA-r-BA) in an IL
under Visible and UV Irradiation
The thermoresponsive micellization
of the diblock copolymer in single IL [C4mim][NTf2] was observed by DLS. Figure 5 showed the particle size of 1 wt % diblock copolymer solution
in [C4mim][NTf2] with the increasing of temperature
under visible or ultraviolet light illumination. At low temperature
below the LCMT, the particle size in [C4mim][NTf2] was below 10 nm, corresponding to the hydrodynamic radius of the
polymer chain itself. As the temperature increased above the LCMT,
the smaller particles completely disappeared, and larger particles
around 160 nm were formed, indicating formation of micelles (Figure 5a). It is obviously
seen that the diblock copolymer containing higher azo contents often
has a lower value of LCMT, which is due to the solvophobic nature
of PAzoMA, for example, LCMTs for PDMA-b-P(AzoMA5.2-r-BA), PDMA-b-P(AzoMA11.0-r-BA), and PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in [C4mim][NTf2] were 103, 93 and 86 °C, respectively (Figure 5b–d), it was getting smaller when
the contents of AzoMA were increased. At the same time, under UV irradiation,
LCMTs for three polymers were 107, 100, and 94 °C, respectively
(Figure 5b–d),
the LCMT gap between the UV or visible light irradiation would gradually
become smaller when the contents of the azo group were decreased.
The LCST phase separation here comes from the cation−π
interaction between the polymer and the ILs, according to which the
structure solvation lead to the change of entropy. It was well known
that the polarity of cis-azobenzene excited by ultraviolet
light is significantly higher than its trans-form.32 The polymer containing more cis-azobenzene would show a better compatibility with ILs, which accounts
for the higher LCST of theP(cis-AzoMA-r-BA) segment, leading to a larger LCMT of PDMA-b-P(cis-AzoMA-r-BA) in ILs ultimately.
Additionally, the cation−π interaction between the azo
groups is significantly larger than that of BA, making contents of
AzoMA play an important role in tuning the LCMT gap.

UV or visible light.

3.4 Thermo- and PhotoInduced Micellization/Demicellization
with Tunable LCMT in Mixed IL
Using single IL [C4mim][NTf2] often makes the LCMT larger than 80 °C
while the value of LCMT would be lower than 0 °C if the single
[C2mim][NTf2] is used. To tune the LCMT in a
reasonable range, we prepared the solvents with two IL blends. Here,
we took PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) as an example to investigate the micellization behavior in the
[C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] mixture under ultraviolet or visible light. As Figure 6 showed, both curves under
UV or visible light irradiation showed the transition of unimers to
micelles when the temperature was elevated. The LCMTs of PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in ILs mixture
([C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/1.5) for trans-form and cis-form were 26 and 34 °C, respectively. There was 8 °C difference
in the LCMTs between the polymers with different conformation of azobenzene.
With the increase of [C4mim][NTf2] content in
ILs mixture, LCMT under ultraviolet or visible light irradiation increased
at the same time.

Figure 6 Temperature dependence of size for PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) under visible (red
line) or UV
(blue line) conditions in ILs mixture (a) [C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/1 by weight; (b)
[C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/1.5 by weight; (c) [C2mim][NTf2]/[C4mim][NTf2] = 1/3 by weight; (d) relationship among
the temperature, LCMT and composition of ILs.

We can also see that the different composition of ILs would
not
make the LCMT differences fluctuate greatly when the system was exposed
under ultraviolet or visible light, that is because the two ILs has
similar polarities and interaction between azo group and [C2mim][NTf2] is similar with that of interaction between
azo group and [C4mim][NTf2].

To further
demonstrate the photoinduced micellization of the diblock
copolymer in ILs mixture, PDMA-b-P(AzoMA13.8-r-BA) in certain composition of ILs was set at
a bistable temperature (28 °C) associated with the change of
the light source. As shown, the size of the aggregates in ILs mixture
was larger than 100 nm (Figure 7a), which indicated the formation of micelles. When the present
system was irradiated with UV light, the size fell to about 8 nm (Figure 7b), indicating that
the photoinduced demicellization was successfully realized, as the
LCMT of the PDMA-b-P(cis-AzoMA13.8-r-BA) is higher than that of PDMA-b-P(trans-AzoMA13.8-r-BA). Then, the visible light was switched back again,
as expected, the unimers aggregated into micelles again with the appearance
of large size particles (Figure 7c). Insets in Figure 7a–c are sample pictures under corresponding
conditions. The sample solution in Figure 7b has a lack of turbidity compared with that
in Figure 7a,c, which
further confirm the photoinduced unimer micelle transition. Figure 7d illustrates the
time dependence of size for the diblock copolymer in IL mixture at
28 °C. It is obvious that there is an induction time for the
process of micellization or demicellization. There are two reasons
for this induction time; one is that the conformational change of
the azobenzene group needs time to be realized, which has been investigated
by UV–vis. Another reason is that the diffusions of polymers
in ILs are needed for either micellization or demicellization, as
multiple polymer chains need time to aggregate together or redissolve
in the ILs by overcoming the intermolecular force. From the data given
above, we can simply see that the reversible photoinduced micellization
can be fully realized by switching the light source.

28 °C: (a) irradiated with visible light (b) irradiated with
ultraviolet light (c) switched to visible light again; (d) time dependence
of size with a different light source.

Here, the reversible light-induced micellization was realized
by
using the LCMT gap caused by a different light source. The polymer
with more contents of cis-azobenzene under ultraviolet
showed a higher value of LCMT. At an intermediate temperature between
the LCMT gap, photoinduced unimer micelle transition was realized,
as Figure 8 showed.

temperature.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, a type of AB block copolymer was prepared successfully.
The PDMA is a segment that can always dissolve in the ILs while the
segment of P(AzoMA-BA) presented light and thermoresponsive LCST characteristics
in ILs, according to which the thermo- and photoresponsive assemblies
in ILs were realized. The LCMT value would be affected by several
factors at the same time, such as the contents and the conformation
of AzoMA, the different composition of ILs. According to these behaviors,
the value of LCMT can be readily tuned to near-room temperature without
changing the polymer structure, which will be useful to design a smart
room temperature material. Lastly, photoinduced “contactless”
reversible unimer micelle transition of block copolymers was realized
by using the LCMT gap caused by the different conformation of the
azo group. Based on the desirable properties mentioned above, we are
hoping to prepare a room temperature artificial actuator in IL based
on the LCST of P(AzoMA-r-BA).
