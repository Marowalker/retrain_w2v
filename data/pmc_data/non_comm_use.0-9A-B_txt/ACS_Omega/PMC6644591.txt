In this article, a novel and high-performance
mesoporous carbon-based
solid acid catalyst was prepared using ethylene tar (ET) as a precursor,
which is a byproduct of ethylene production. First, ET was carbonized
at 550 °C by using magnesium acetate as the template. After that,
the mesoporous ET-based solid acid catalyst was obtained by a one-step
sulfonation process that removes the templates simultaneously. On
the basis of these facts, the maximum yield of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(5-HMF) in the presence of an ET catalyst during the dehydration of
fructose can reach 87.8%. This effective catalytic activity is mainly
attributed to the large specific surface area and high density of
sulfonic acid groups existing in the ET catalyst. Moreover, no distinct
activity drop was observed during five recycling runs that confirmed
good recyclability and thermal stability of the ET catalyst. This
research provides a novel and promising method for the utilization
of ET as a low-cost, recyclable, and high-performance catalyst.

1 Introduction
With
the huge consumption of fossil fuels, the research on biomass-based
chemicals has become an attractive issue to solve the problem of energy
scarcity.1,2 Among the numerous biomass-derived chemicals,
5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) as an acid-catalyzed dehydration product
of fructose is one of the versatile platform chemicals, which plays
an important role in the synthesis of biofuels and other valuable
chemical intermediates such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, 2,5-furandicarbaldehyde,
levulinic acid (LA), and so on.3,4 In recent years, great
efforts have been taken for exploiting the effective way in promoting
the formation of 5-HMF by the dehydration of cellulose, glucose, and
fructose.3−7 A range of catalysts have been employed, including liquid acids,8−10 H-mordenites/zeolites,11−14 phosphates of transition metals,15−18 ion-exchange resins,19,20 and carbon-based solid acids.21−27 However, these catalysts usually have some disadvantages, such as
separation difficulty, high price, low specific surface area, low
activity, and poor thermal stability.

Recently, carbon-based
solid acid from polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
as the raw material has aroused researchers’ interest owing
to its advantages in mechanical stability and chemical inertness.28 A lot of experiments have been conducted in
investigating the preparation of a carbon-based solid acid catalyst
with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons as the raw material. Hara et
al. have reported a solid acid catalyst containing SO3H
groups by the incomplete carbonization of naphthalene in concentrated
sulfuric acid.29 The acid density of products
can reach 4.9 mmol/g that is much higher than other traditional solid
sulfonic acid catalysts. Daengprasert et al. have found that when
sulfonated naphthalene-based catalyst is employed for the conversion
of fructose into 5-HMF, the yield of 5-HMF can reach 29.8%.30 Tanemura et al. have reported the synthesis
of strong acidic sulfonated naphthalene, pyrene, phenanthrene resins
with p-xylylene glycol, or terephthalaldehyde as
the cross-linking agent.31−33 In addition, they have also carried
out the experiments in the synthesis of the strongly acidic sulfonated
polynaphthalene, polypyrene, and polyanthracene via an oxidative coupling
reaction using FeCl3 in nitrobenzene under nitrogen.34 These sulfonated condensed polynuclear aromatic
(S-COPNA) resins are insoluble in boiling water and many hot organic
solvents and can be recycled without an obvious loss of activity.
Moreover, the activity of S-COPNA resins is much higher than that
of conventional solid acids.

However, most of the reported catalysts
from polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons have low specific surface area and incomplete pore system,
which reduces the probability of contact of reactants and the internal
surface acidic sites of a catalyst.35−37 Furthermore, the expensive
raw materials limit its wide-ranging applications. As a sort of byproduct
in the production of ethylene, the output of ethylene tar (ET) is
constantly increasing with the development of ethylene industry.38 As we know, ET has a high content of polynuclear
aromatic hydrocarbon and a low content of branched hydrocarbon chains
that can become an ideal candidate in preparing a mesoporous carbon-based
solid acid catalyst. Until now, the recycled conversion of ET to useful
materials is restricted that ET is mainly used for the production
of carbon black, asphalt, and fuel oil. Other high-value-added applications
originated from ET have yet not been developed.39 To solve this problem, we used ET as the raw material to
prepare a mesoporous carbon-based solid acid catalyst in replacing
expensive polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Moreover, few papers
have reported ET-based solid acid catalyst for the dehydration of
fructose into 5-HMF.

In this work, a facile and effective method
was carried out in
preparing mesoporous ET-based solid acid. ET was used as the raw material,
and magnesium acetate was used as the template. The mixture was carbonized
at a certain temperature. In addition, a novel mesoporous ET-based
solid-acid catalyst was prepared via a one-step sulfonation process
by using concentrated sulfuric acid as the sulfonating agent. Compared
with the traditional two-step method of removing templates followed
by sulfonation, this method can further increase the specific surface
area and simplify the preparation process. The catalytic activity
and recyclability of the mesoporous ET-based solid acid catalyst have
been studied in the reaction for the conversion of fructose to 5-HMF.
Moreover, the effect of reaction conditions including reaction temperature,
reaction time, catalyst dosage, and solvent and additive on the yield
of 5-HMF and the conversion of fructose were systematically investigated.
This method provides a new idea for the preparation of a novel and
high-performance ET catalyst.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Fructose (>99%), 5-HMF
(>99%), LA (>99%), and polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30 (PVP-K30, >98%)
were
obtained from Sigma Reagent Company. Isopropyl alcohol, magnesium
acetate, concentrated sulfuric acid, and acetonitrile were purchased
from Beijing Chemicals Co. Ltd. The crystal water of magnesium acetate
was removed by heating it at 140 °C in an oven until it reaches
a constant weight before use. ET was provided by PetroChina Jilin
Petrochemical Company. The volatile molecules (<250 °C) of
ET were removed by vacuum distillation before use.

2.2 Preparation of a Mesoporous ET-Based Solid
Acid Catalyst
First, ET and magnesium acetate in a mass ratio
of 2:8 were mixed by mechanical grinding. The mixture was heated to
a certain temperature at a heating rate of 5 °C/min in a nitrogen
atmosphere and maintained for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature,
the obtained carbonized product was taken out from the tube furnace.
Then, a one-step method was employed to accomplish the dissolution
of MgO and the sulfonation of a carbonized product by concentrated
sulfuric acid at the same time. Along with concentrated sulfuric acid,
the carbonized product was added into a three-necked flask and stirred
at 150 °C for 15 h under the nitrogen atmosphere. After that,
the system was cooled down to ambient temperature and washed with
hot water until the filtrate became neutral. Finally, the product
was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain the mesoporous
ET-based solid acid catalyst, which is denoted as the ET catalyst.
The preparation process of the catalyst is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Preparation Process
of the ET Catalyst
2.3 Dehydration of Fructose
The reaction
procedure was as follows: d-fructose, isopropyl alcohol,
catalysts, and PVP-K30 were added into a stainless steel reactor with
a Teflon liner equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Dehydration was initiated
by heating the reaction system to a certain temperature. After the
reaction was completed, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature,
and the catalyst was obtained by filtering under vacuum.4 At last, the catalyst was washed three times
with ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 12 h for the next use. The
filtrate was diluted with deionized water for the analysis of the
conversion, yield, and selectivity.

The conversion of fructose
was analyzed by an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) system equipped with a refractive index detector using a COSMOSIL
Sugar-D Packed column (250 mm × 4.6 mm and 5 μm) at 30
°C. The mobile phase was 75% acetonitrile and 25% water (v/v)
to analyze the conversion of fructose at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.

The yield of 5-HMF was analyzed using an Agilent 1260 HPLC system
equipped with a UV detector (284 nm) and an Extend-C18 column (250
mm × 4.6 mm and 5 μm) at 35 °C. The mobile phase was
5% methanol and 95% water (v/v) to analyze the yield of 5-HMF at a
flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.

The conversion, yield, and selectivity
are defined according to
the following formula      

2.4 Characterization of the
Catalyst
A Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometer was
used to measure the presence of functional groups on the samples’
surface.

The standard back acid–base titration method
was used to quantify the acid density of the catalysts. The catalyst
was predried in a vacuum drying oven at 100 °C for 2 h prior
to analysis, and then accurate 1.00 g of the catalyst was soaked in
50 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution 24 h before back-titrating with 0.1 M
HCl solution. The NaOH solution and HCl solution used in the experiment
were calibrated. The acid density of the catalyst was measured three
times, and then the results were averaged.

The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded
with a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer, applying Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.1542 nm) under ambient temperature.

The nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained
on a micromeritics TriStar II surface area. Before the tests, the
samples were outgassed at 120 °C for 12 h under the nitrogen
atmosphere. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions
were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method,
respectively.4

The mesoporous morphology
of the catalyst was obtained on a JEM-2000EX
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique with a working voltage
of 200 kV.

The thermal stability of the catalyst was measured
using a Q5000
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) instrument under flowing nitrogen
with a heating rate of 10 °C/min from 25 to 800 °C.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Carbonization
Temperature on the
BET Surface Area and Acid Density of the Catalyst
The detailed
data for the specific surface area and acid density of the ET catalyst
are presented in Table 1. Obviously, it can be observed that with the increase of carbonization
temperature, the specific surface area of the ET catalyst gradually
increases, be it for before sulfonation or for after sulfonation.
In contrast to the specific surface area of the ET catalyst before
sulfonation, the specific surface area of the ET catalyst after sulfonation
decreases, be it for a one-step method or for a two-step method. This
phenomenon is mainly caused by the collapse of a partial pore of the
ET catalyst during the sulfonation reaction. Moreover, the specific
surface area of the ET catalyst after sulfonation for the one-step
method is higher than that of the two-step method in different temperatures.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the simple one-step method can
effectively prevent the collapse of the pores of the ET catalyst and
obtain high specific surface area to some extent.

b Before sulfonation: removal
of templates
with 2 M dilute sulfuric acid.

c One-step method: removal of templates
and sulfonation were performed simultaneously, sulfonation temperature
150 °C, sulfonation time 15 h, and incomplete carbonized products/concentrated
sulfuric acid (g/mL) = 1/10.

d Two-step method: first, the removal
of templates with 2 M dilute sulfuric acid and then sulfonated at
150 °C for 15 h, and incomplete carbonized products/concentrated
sulfuric acid (g/mL) = 1/10.

e Yield of 5-HMF: reaction temperature
130 °C, reaction time 140 min, fructose 0.5 g, catalyst 0.25
g, isopropyl alcohol 7 mL, and PVP-K30 0.2 g.

As shown in Table 1, with the increase of carbonization temperature, the
acid density
of the ET catalyst obtained by the one-step method or the two-step
method first increases and then decreases. The increase of the specific
surface area leads to the increase in the binding sites of the SO3H groups and an incomplete carbonized product. As a result,
the acid density of the ET catalyst gradually increases. However,
when the carbonization temperature further increases, more carbons
are formed, resulting in a rigid structure and rendering sulfonation
difficult.21 Therefore, the acid density
of the ET catalyst decreases.

The yields of 5-HMF obtained by
the one-step method and the two-step
method are also presented in Table 1. The yield of 5-HMF obtained by the one-step method
is higher than that of the two-step method in different carbonization
temperatures. Obviously, this is because the specific surface area
and acid density of the one-step method are higher than those of the
two-step method. When the carbonization temperature is 550 °C,
the catalyst obtained by the one-step method not only has the highest
acid density (4.99 mmol/g) and a relatively high specific surface
area (552.4 m2/g) but also can obtain the highest yield
of 5-HMF (87.8%). On the basis of these data, the ET catalyst is chosen
in the following experiments.

3.2 Mesoporous
Structure of the Catalyst
The mesoporous structure of the
ET catalyst was verified by N2 adsorption isotherm and
pore size distribution. As shown
in Figure 1a, it can
be seen that the characteristic type IV isotherm and a typical H2 hysteresis loop appear in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.4–0.7,
and the specific surface area calculated by the BET method is about
552.4 m2/g. The BJH pore size distribution indicated that
the average pore size is about 37 nm, as shown in Figure 1b. On the basis of the analysis,
this mesoporous structure is beneficial for the utilization of the
inner surface active sites of the ET catalyst.

Figure 1 N2 adsorption
isotherm (a) and BJH pore size distribution
plot (b) of the ET catalyst.

3.3 FT-IR Spectra
The FT-IR spectra of
ET are presented in Figure 2a. The strong peak at 3440 cm–1 is assigned
to the characteristic stretching vibration of the phenolic O–H
groups. The peak at 2924 cm–1 is ascribed to the
stretching vibration of C–H groups for saturated hydrocarbon.
The absorption peak at 1631 cm–1 is assigned to
the stretching vibration of C=C groups in the aromatic nucleus.
The weak peak at 746 cm–1 is originated from the
out-of-plane bending vibration of C–H groups in the aromatic
ring. In addition, the FT-IR spectra of the carbonized product and
the ET catalyst are presented in Figure 2b,c. The adsorption of the carbonized product
at 503 cm–1 is due to the incorporation of magnesium
oxide. The increase in the intensity of C=C groups of the ET
catalyst illustrates that sulfonation promotes the further polycondensation
of carbonized products.31,40 The adsorption bands
of the ET catalyst at 1230, 1040, and 619 cm–1 are
ascribed to the S=O vibration, indicating the presence of SO3H groups on the ET catalyst.

(b), and ET catalyst
(c).

3.4 X-Ray
Diffraction
The ET, carbonized
product, and ET catalyst are analyzed by XRD. The XRD pattern of ET
is presented in Figure 3a. The XRD pattern displayed a C(002) diffraction peak at 2θ
= 22.76°, which is attributed to the amorphous carbon composed
of aromatic carbon sheets oriented in a considerably random fashion.41 The definitive C(101) graphite peak at 2θ
= 42.84° indicated the presence of more graphite-like structures.41 The XRD pattern of the carbonized product is
presented in Figure 3b, displaying diffraction peaks at 36.80°, 42.83°, 62.01°,
74.52°, and 78.38°, which are consistent with the XRD spectrum
of magnesium oxide.42 Magnesium oxide is
the decomposition product of magnesium acetate after releasing CO
and CO2 gas under high temperature. No other peaks are
found because the diffraction peaks of the catalyst matrix are obscured
by strong diffraction peaks of magnesium oxide. The XRD pattern of
the ET catalyst is presented in Figure 3c. There is not a large difference in the XRD patterns
between ET and the ET catalyst, suggesting that carbonization and
the sulfonation process did not affect the microstructure of ET so
much.34 Moreover, there are no diffraction
peaks of magnesium oxide in Figure 3c, which indicated that the templates have been completely
removed.

(c).

3.5 Morphology
of the Catalyst
The TEM
image of the mesoporous ET catalyst is shown in Figure 4. It can be seen that these mesopores are
distributed randomly and that the morphology of the catalyst is also
irregular. In addition, the formation of these disordered mesopores
is due to the dissolution of the nanosized MgO.43,44 Furthermore, the average pore diameter of the catalyst on the TEM
image is roughly consistent with the BJH pore size distribution plot.

Figure 4 TEM image
of the ET catalyst.

3.6 Thermal
Stability of the Catalyst
The TGA curves of the ET catalyst
are shown in Figure 5. The TGA curves illustrated that a slight
weight loss appears at 70–110 °C, which is attributable
to the loss of free moisture adsorbed on the surface of the ET catalyst.
The TGA curve tends to be flat at 110–320 °C, which indicated
that there is almost no weight loss in this temperature range. After
320 °C, the apparent weight loss of the catalyst is observed
because of decomposition. Therefore, the catalyst has good thermal
stability below 320 °C.

3.7 Catalytic Dehydration of
Fructose by the ET
Catalyst
3.7.1 Influence of Reaction Conditions
The dehydration reaction of fructose to produce 5-HMF with the ET
catalyst in isopropyl alcohol was evaluated at different temperatures.
The results in Figure 6a show that high temperature is beneficial to the conversion of fructose.
When the reaction temperature increases from 110 to 130 °C, the
selectivity of 5-HMF increases from 64.8 to 71.4% and the yield of
5-HMF increases from 52 to 64.2%. The low selectivity and yield below
130 °C are ascribed to the existence of partial dehydrated intermediates.
When the temperature is higher than 130 °C, the yield and selectivity
decrease. This is because 5-HMF is decomposed into LA, 5-HMF self-polymerization,
or cross-polymerization at high temperature.45 Therefore, the temperature of 130 °C is selected as the optimum
temperature for the fructose dehydration into 5-HMF over the ET catalyst.

Figure 6 Effect
of reaction conditions on the conversion of fructose into
5-HMF with the ET catalyst. (a) Effect of the reaction temperature
(fructose 0.5 g, reaction time 120 min, catalyst 0.2 g, isopropyl
alcohol 8 mL, and PVP-K30 0.1 g). (b) Effect of the reaction time
(fructose 0.5 g, reaction temperature 130 °C, catalyst 0.2 g,
isopropyl alcohol 8 mL, and PVP-K30 0.1 g). (c) Effect of the dosage
of a catalyst (fructose 0.5 g, reaction temperature 130 °C, reaction
time 140 min, isopropyl alcohol 8 mL, and PVP-K30 0.1 g). (d) Effect
of the dosage of isopropyl alcohol (fructose 0.5 g, reaction temperature
130 °C, reaction time 140 min, catalyst 0.25 g, and PVP-K30 0.1
g). (e) Effect of the dosage of PVP-K30 (fructose 0.5 g, reaction
temperature 130 °C, reaction time 140 min, catalyst 0.25 g, and
isopropyl alcohol 7 mL).

From the results presented in Figure 6b, a series of dehydration reactions of fructose
were carried out at different time ranges from 110 to 150 min. With
the increase of reaction time from 110 to 140 min, the yield of 5-HMF
increases from 63.8 to 66.2% and the conversion of fructose increases
from 86.5 to 95.4%. Nevertheless, prolonging the reaction time from
140 to 150 min results in a slight decrease in the yield of 5-HMF
and a continuous increase in the conversion of fructose. This phenomenon
may be due to the formation of polysaccharides in humans.46 Consequently, 140 min is selected as the ideal
time for the dehydration of fructose into 5-HMF with the ET catalyst.

As shown in Figure 6c, the dosage of the catalyst has a significant effect on the dehydration
reaction of fructose. The yield, selectivity, and conversion rapidly
increase within the dosage of the catalyst in the range of 0.1–0.25
g; the results can be ascribed to an increase in the amount of available
sulfonic acid sites. Further increase in the dosage of the catalyst
results in a slight decrease in yield and selectivity. The main reason
is that an excessive catalyst can lead to a consequent formation of
various intermediate, parallel, and consecutive products.16 Thus, the optimum catalyst dosage is 0.25 g
and the yield of 5-HMF can reach 81.8%.

Most of the dehydration
reactions of fructose are chosen using
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent;47−50 however, the high boiling point
of DMSO (189 °C) is not conducive to the separation of 5-HMF.
Therefore, we choose isopropyl alcohol with the low boiling point
(82 °C) as the solvent.10 The effect
of the dosage of isopropyl alcohol on the dehydration reaction of
fructose is given in Figure 6d. It can be seen that the solvent has little effect on the
conversion of fructose. However, when using 6 mL of isopropyl alcohol,
the selectivity and the yield of 5-HMF are lower, and the color of
the reaction mixture is dark brown. It indicates the formation of
condensation products such as coke.51 The
yield of 5-HMF remains nearly unchanged when the dosage of isopropyl
alcohol is in the range of 7–10 mL. Hence, 7 mL of isopropyl
alcohol is chosen as the appropriate dosage of the solvent in subsequent
experiments.

The effect of the dosage of additive PVP-K30 on
the reaction was
also investigated. PVP-K30 is a kind of green hydrophilic polymer,
which contains the monomer structure of N-methyl
pyrrolidinone (NMP) and the chain structure of polyethylene. It has
been confirmed that NMP can absorb water produced in the reaction
and inhibit a series of side reactions during the dehydration of fructose,
such as polymerization, condensation, and hydration of 5-HMF and degradation
of 5-HMF producing LA, formic acid, and so on.52 The effect of the dosage of additive PVP-K30 on the reaction
is shown in Figure 6e. With the increase of the dosage of PVP-K30, the conversion of
fructose between 94 and 97.9% is not significantly changed. However,
the yield and selectivity of 5-HMF first increase and then decrease.
When the dosage of PVP-K30 is 0.2 g, the yield and selectivity reach
a maximum value of 87.8 and 89.7%, respectively. It can be seen that
the addition of PVP-K30 can inhibit the occurrence of the side reaction,
but excess addition will lead to a viscous system, which are not conducive
to the formation of 5-HMF. Thus, the proper dosage of PVP-K30 is 0.2
g.

As shown in Table S1, when no
catalyst
was used, 9.2% conversion of fructose and 2.1% yield of 5-HMF were
obtained. In addition, it is found that 5-HMF (87.8%), LA (5.5%),
and other unknown byproducts can be obtained by using the ET catalyst
(550 °C) of the highest acid density. In addition, the catalytic
performances of the ET catalyst were compared with that of Amberlyst-15
and SBA-15-SO3H. We can see that Amberlyst-15 has a high
acid density and a low specific surface area. SBA-15-SO3H has a high specific surface area and a low acid density. The maximum
yield of 5-HMF was obtained by using the ET catalyst, which is higher
than that of Amberlyst-15 and SBA-15-SO3H. Hence, it can
be concluded that the catalyst with high surface area and high acid
density is beneficial to the formation of 5-HMF. Moreover, the apparent
activation energy of the reaction can be decreased by using the ET
catalyst (Table S2).

3.7.2 Recyclability of the Catalyst
The
recyclability of the catalyst is of vital importance for industrial
production. Thus, the recyclability of the ET catalyst was examined
five times in repeated reactions under the optimum reaction conditions.
After each recycling experiment, the recovered catalyst was washed
three times with ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 12 h before the
next test.2 As shown in Figure 7, it can be seen that the yield,
conversion, and selectivity decrease only 10.0, 7 and 5% after five
cycles, respectively. Thus, the results demonstrated that the ET catalyst
can be reused in the dehydration of fructose.

ET catalyst.

4 Conclusions
ET, as a byproduct in the ethylene industry,
is readily available
at low cost; yet, it has barely been developed toward any economically
and technically rewarding applications. In this work, ET has been
successfully used to prepare a novel and high-performance mesoporous
ET-based solid acid catalyst by a one-step sulfonation process that
removes the templates simultaneously. It demonstrates that the ET
catalyst has excellent catalytic performance in the conversion of
fructose into 5-HMF because of its large specific surface area and
high density of sulfonic acid groups. Under the optimum reaction conditions,
the maximum yield of 5-HMF can reach 87.8%, and no distinct activity
drop was observed during five recycling runs that confirmed good recyclability
and thermal stability of the ET catalyst. The apparent activation
energy of the reaction can be decreased by using the ET catalyst.
Moreover, on the basis of these facts, the synthetic route of this
novel catalyst provides a promising method for the utilization of
ET.
