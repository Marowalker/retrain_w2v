The
formation mechanism of calcium carbonate (CC) skeletal tissues
in biomineralization has remained poorly understood for a long time.
Here, we propose an artificial CC biomineralization system equivalent
to the natural one in terms of the primary physicochemical mechanism.
Our system is constructed of a polymer gel and a CC solution unsaturated
by a dissociated anionic polymer. The gel network consists of proton
donor and proton acceptor polymers, which are analogues of polymers
in the natural biomineralization system and have affinity for each
other through hydrogen bonding interaction. Artificial biomineralization
takes place within the polymer gel to produce a monolithic composite
of the network and CC, whose powder X-ray diffraction pattern indicates
calcite or calcite/vaterite. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy observation of the composite during the mineralization
process revealed a two-phase structure (network/CC solid solution
phase and CC hypercomplex gel phase). As artificial biomineralization
proceeds, the solid phase grows in size at the cost of the gel phase
as if the latter is substituted with the former, until the solid phase
occupies the whole depth of the composite. These results suggest that
the hypercomplex gel is the precursor of the resultant network/CC
solid solution, and its discontinuous change is a phase transition
to the solid solution. Despite minute differences in higher-order
structures between our model system and the natural system, the fundamental
structure of CC skeletal tissues in the latter can be interpreted
as a network/CC solid solution, whereas that of CC cartilaginous tissues
as a CC hypercomplex gel. Then, it can be deduced that, in biomineralization,
the CC skeletal tissue is in principle formed via a phase transition
of the CC cartilaginous tissue.

Introduction
There are three major
skeletal tissues in biological systems: hydroxyapatite
(HA), calcium carbonate (CC), and silica skeletal tissues. Although
the physicochemical mechanism of such biomineralization had been investigated
for many years, the details remain unclear. The formation process
of HA skeletal tissues has been studied both extensively and intensively
probably owing to its medical importance. The bone, a kind of HA skeletal
tissue, contains collagen and acidic proteins besides HA1 (Table 1). Anatomical microscopic observation has shown that the cartilaginous
tissue containing collagen and chondroitin sulfate is substituted
with bone in the course of bone formation.2 Antler, another kind of HA skeletal tissue that is usually regenerated
annually, contains collagen, chondroitin sulfate,3 as well as ca. 60% of HA in weight.4 At an early stage of generation, an antler cartilage that contains
collagen and chondroitin sulfate5,6 is built up. After termination
of growth, this cartilage is substituted with a bony tissue, and the
exterior skin layer peels off to reveal the antler. This substitution
of the precursor with the antler can be easily observed with the naked
eye, probably because the growth rate of the precursor is sufficiently
higher than its substitution rate. Contrariwise, if the growth rate
is as low as the substitution rate, the skeletal tissue would appear
to be made directly without a precursor. In summary, different types
of HA skeletal tissues often have cartilaginous precursors.

a The class of natural polymers reported
in the references are estimated by analogy to those in the artificial
system.

Biomineralization
of skeletal tissues is different from the usual
precipitation of minerals. The former takes place at specific locations
with a geometry characteristic to the tissue regardless of cleavage
of the mineral, whereas the latter takes place everywhere in the saturated
or supersaturated solution without a well-defined macroscopic form.
To explain this difference, the existence of a polymer network where
biomineralization exclusively takes place has been supposed.7−9 If a monolithic composite of HA and a network composed of polymers
analogous to the natural ones could be obtained with high HA content
in an HA solution, then the composite could be called an HA skeletal
material, and such a system could be called an artificial biomineralization
system.

In the artificial biomineralization systems we identified
previously,10−12 a network consisting of proton donor and proton acceptor
polymers
with hydrogen bonding between them was found to be suitable for forming
the gel network. The proton donor polymer, for example poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) having −OH, is an analogue of collagen that
has hydroxyproline residues;13 whereas
the proton acceptor polymer, for example poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)
having −CO2–, is an analogue of
chondroitin sulfate that has acidic groups. Besides, an HA solution
that is concentrated but unsaturated with respect to HA by adding
the polyelectrolyte PAA was proven to be effective here (Table 1). The network immersed
in this solution swelled and was continuously converted to an HA hypercomplex
gel (Figure 1a), and
further transformed discontinuously into a network/HA solid solution.
By utilizing several kinds of polymer networks, the saturated HA contents
in the monolithic solid solutions ranged from ca. 60 to 95% in weight
in the dry state, which are similar to the compositions of vertebrate
bony tissues.12 These results indicate
that the polymer network in bone biomineralization will consist of
collagen and acidic proteins. Instead of the hole zone of fibril,14 the proton-donating function of collagen is
important, because gelatin is also an effective network-forming polymer.12 The fibril structure is rather responsible for
the bone strength. On the other hand, the polyelectrolyte PAA in an
HA solution in the artificial system mimics the acidic proteins in
the body fluid (e.g., blood plasma15).
In our model, the fundamental structure of cartilaginous tissue is
interpreted as an HA hypercomplex gel, whereas that of the HA skeletal
tissues as a network/HA solid solution.10−12 In this way, the change
of the cartilaginous tissue into the bony tissue is naturally explained
as a phase transition from an HA hypercomplex gel to a network/HA
solid solution, from the perspective of material science.

electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding (···).
(a) Artificial system and (b) natural system of HA biomineralization.
(c) Artificial system and (d) natural system of CC biomineralization.
(e) Artificial system and (f) natural system of silica biomineralization.
The hypercomplex network forms a hypercomplex gel in the mineral solution
and will further change discontinuously into a skeletal material or
skeletal tissue via phase transition.

In different animal phyla, mollusca squid,16 mollusca shell,17,18 and echinodermata echinoidea
(sea urchin)19,20 among others have CC skeletal
tissues. Furthermore, sponge21 in animalia
and diatom22−24 in plantae both have silica skeletal tissues. All
these tissues contain both mineral and organic polymers that can be
regularly classified according to their physicochemical interactions
(Table 1). Hence, the
formation mechanism of network/HA solid solution can be theoretically
generalized to the systems of network/CC and network/silica solid
solutions. This way, the solid solution model may lead to a unified
biomineralization mechanism for all three kinds of skeletal tissues.

To experimentally verify this hypothesis, in this study we manufactured
a monolithic network/CC solid solution using proton donor and proton
acceptor polymers and polyelectrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the
obtained network/CC solid solution was formed via a phase transition
of a hypercomplex gel. Then, we compare our artificial CC biomineralization
system to natural examples reported in the literature, and discuss
the similarity between the artificial and natural ones in not only
the ions and polymers but also the formation process. Finally, the
extension of our model to the biomineralization of silica skeletal
tissues will be considered.

Results and Discussion
The occurrence
of artificial biomineralization was checked for
four combinations of the polymer network and the CC solution (Table 2). The immersed polymer
network absorbed the CC solution and swelled to become a hydrogel.
Then, the hydrogel solidified in the solution of x = 30. These solid composites (1–3) have high dry weight uptakes
between 80 and 90%, implying successful artificial biomineralization.
Despite using the same network as composite (3), composite (4) with x = 10 remained as a hydrogel in the solution and had a
low dry weight uptake of W = 11.4%. In this case,
artificial biomineralization did not take place because the concentration
of the CC solution was too low.

under Different
Conditions for Artificial CC Biomineralization

2	PVA/PAA-p	30	solid	90.0	
3	PVA/PAA-c	30	solid	80.7	
4	PVA/PAA-c	10	hydrogel	11.4	
The powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of these composites
are shown in Figure 2. Although the solution was unsaturated with respect to CC, composites
(1–2) exhibit calcite structure that is the most stable CC
polymorph, whereas composite (3) exhibits vaterite as well as calcite
structures. Hence, composites (1–3) can be called artificial
CC skeletal materials. As anticipated from its gel state in the solution,
no characteristic peak of the CC lattice was observed in the diffraction
pattern of composite (4), indicating that it is a noncrystalline material.
In this composite, the low dry weight uptake is not from the CC skeletal
material but probably from the ions absorbed onto the polymer network.
Chitosan and PVA are proton donor polymers owing to the −OH
and −NH2 of chitosan and −OH of PVA. On the
other hand, PAA is a proton acceptor polymer owing to its −CO2–. These three polymers, which were adopted
in the polymer network in our previous studies of artificial HA biomineralization,10−12 are proven here to be also useful for comprising the polymer network
in artificial CC biomineralization regardless of the manner of cross-linking.
Thus, the polymer network consisting of polymers with hydrogen bonding
interaction among themselves will have affinity for not only HA but
also CC. This strongly implies that the CC and HA biomineralizations
are based on a common mechanism. The presence of two polymorphs of
CC in composite (3) is analogous to the presence of both calcite and
aragonite structures in shell nacre.25 Though
the cause of such polymorphism is a fascinating problem, it is out
of the scope of this paper and is scheduled for future work. PAA in
the CC solution was also used in artificial biomineralization of the
HA skeletal material. From this commonality between the HA and CC
artificial biomineralization systems, and the fact that body fluid
contains acidic proteins that stably maintain the high ionic concentration
of HA,15 it can be hypothesized that acidic
biopolymers could be dissolved in the solution for CC biomineralization,
for example, the extrapallial fluid of bivalves,26 to keep the ionic concentration of CC at a higher level.
Owing to this effect, the volume of the compartment in which the CC
solution is reserved can be quite small.

(1–4) in Table 2. For clarity, the patterns are displaced
upwards by 1000 × m cps units. (1) m = 5, (2) m = 2, (3) m = 1, (4) m = 0.

Energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was carried
out for another solid composite synthesized under the same condition
as composite (1) and with W = 80.5%. This sample
has a microporous structure (Figure S1, Supporting Information) because the original hydrogel was microporous.
The line analysis of elements shows almost constant intensity in the
cross section, except for dips at the vacant microvoid spaces (Figure
S2, Supporting Information). This observation
means that mineralization took place throughout the hydrogel, and
monolithic composites of chitosan/PAA network and CC were formed uniformly.
Crystallization of CC in gel media has been well studied, and many
kinds of composites of the polymer network and CC have been synthesized.27−29 Wakayama et al. synthesized chitosan/PAA and CC monolithic composites
on a glass substrate utilizing a supercritical CO2 fluid.30,31 Here, we formed the CC skeletal material under atmospheric pressure
and room temperature instead. Also, the supercritical CO2 method seems to be applicable only to composites of a polymer network
and carbonates, whereas our method is valid for the synthesis of composites
of the polymer network and HA.

Next, we focus on the artificial
CC biomineralization system utilizing
the PVA/PAA-c network to examine the formation mechanism of the CC
skeletal material. The swelling degree, Sw, was plotted against the
dry weight uptake for composites (A–D) that underwent different
mineralization periods of less than 3 weeks (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Swelling degree against the dry weight uptake
of composites (A–D)
synthesized from the PVA/PAA-c network in Table 3.

Naturally, Sw decreases whereas W increases as
the CC mineralization proceeds. This tendency means the hydrogel swollen
in the CC solution is converted to a solid composite in the solution.
To clarify this change, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the cross sections of dried composites (A–D) are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 SEM images of cross sections
of composites (A–D) at several
stages during artificial biomineralization. (A) W = 14.8%, (B) W = 56.2%, (C) W =
68.9%, (D) W = 81.4%. One or both sides of the composite
were attached to silicon wafer (Si) by a binder resin (Bi). Sometimes,
the binder peeled off to reveal vacant space (V), for example, in
(A,B). The transient composites (B,C) contained both H and S phases.
In each pair of images, the white rectangle on the left indicates
the region shown in the right-hand side image. A line is drawn across
each yellow rectangle for the EDX analysis in Figure 5.

Composite (A) was a hydrogel swollen in the CC solution. Accordingly,
it can be regarded as a polymer network with absorbed ions (W = 14.8%). This noncrystalline material is assigned as
the H phase. Understandably, this phase mainly contributes to Sw.
In the subsequent composite (B) having W = 56.2%,
a new phase emerges from the surface in addition to the H phase. This
new phase, assigned as the S phase, can be solid regions of the composite
in the solution and hardly contributes to Sw of the composite, because
Sw decreases with the increase of W as shown in Figure 3. Instead, the S
phase is crystalline because the composite having high W has the same CC peaks as shown by composite (3) in Figure 2. As the artificial biomineralization
proceeds, in composite (C) with W = 68.9%, the S
phase grows at the cost of the H phase to occupy all the surface.
In composite (D) with W = 81.4%, the S phase becomes
thicker, whereas the H phase is thinner and disappears at the middle
depth of the composite. Eventually, the whole sample will become a
monolithic composite of the polymer network and CC. In this way, the
decrease of Sw and the increase of W along with the
progression of artificial biomineralization can be ascribed to the
two-phase structure in the composite and their composition change,
that is, the increase of the S phase at the cost of the H phase.

Next, we elucidate the fundamental structures of H and S phases. Figure 5 shows the results of EDX analysis of elements Ca, C, and
O (conducted in the area indicated by the yellow rectangles shown
in Figure 4). The order
of region of interest (ROI) intensity is O < Ca < C in every
H phase, but C < O < Ca in every S phase. Phase H is obviously
Ca-poor as can be recognized in Figure 5A–C, whereas phase S is Ca-rich as shown in Figure 5B–D. The intensity
levels of each phase seem to be almost the same even in different
composites at this resolution. In the S phase, there is no polymer
domain where the ROI of Ca should be 0 [counts]. This means that the
polymers do not aggregate and disperse inside the CC phase. The concentrations
of elements change discontinuously at the interface between the H
and S phases. For example, from phase H to phase S, the Ca concentration
increases and the C concentration decreases sharply. In this way,
these phases are clearly different in elemental composition. The ZAF
atom % of elements Ca, C, and O in the white square in Figure 5 are listed in Table 3.

a The total content
of Ca, C, and
O in each area is normalized to 100%, eliminating H, which cannot
be detected in EDX. The value in ( ) was calculated from the formula
of the respective component, PVA/PAA-c or CaCO3.

Certainly, the composition of the
H phase is near that of the original
network (PVA/PAA-c), whereas the composition of the S phase approaches
that of CC.

Such a two-phase structure had also been observed
in the artificial
biomineralization of the HA (Ca5(PO4)3OH) skeletal material. Along the cross-sectional line of those composites, the concentration profile of
P as well as Ca could be measured by EDX, and therefore the profile
of the [Ca]/[P] molar ratio was determined.10,12 This [P] was equivalent to the concentration of phosphate [Pw] contributed from dry weight uptake W, [P]
= [Pw]. Therefore, the obtained values [Ca]/[P] ≈
1.67 in the Ca-rich and high-W crystalline phase
directly indicated that W was brought about by HA,
which has [Ca]/[P] ≈ 1.67. In the Ca-poor and low-W noncrystalline phase, on the other hand, the content of P was low
with [Ca]/[P] ≈ 3, indicating that the W came
not from the HA but the adhesion of HPO42– as well as Ca2+ ions. Here, it should be noted that the
noncrystalline structure cannot be ascribed to amorphous HA, which
should still have [Ca]/[P] ≈ 1.67. However, in the present
case of artificial biomineralization of the CC skeletal material shown
in Figure 5, the concentration
of carbon, [C], is a sum from the polymer network, [Cp],
and the carbonate in dry weight uptake, [Cw]. Namely, [C]
= [Cp] + [Cw]. Besides, this [Cw]
cannot be distinguished from [C] in the composite by EDX, and therefore
the existence of CC should not be judged using the molar ratio [Ca]/[C].
If [Cw] can be determined and [Ca]/[Cw] ≈
l in the S phase, this could directly indicate that the W is due to CC (CaCO3). If [Ca]/[Cw] > l
is
obtained in the H phase, then the W is due to adhesion
of HCO3– and Ca2+ ions. Nevertheless,
whether the weight increase here is ascribed to artificial CC biomineralization
or ion adhesion can be reasonably judged from the concentration profile
of not [Ca]/[Cw] but [Ca] only, because the profile of
[Ca] obtained here is quite similar to the one in the artificial biomineralization
of HA skeletal materials. Both the HA and CC artificial biomineralization
systems use the PVA/PAA network. In both systems, the [Ca] profile
level was almost constant in each phase and changed discontinuously
at the interface between the Ca-rich and Ca-poor phases. Furthermore, W was high in the Ca-rich crystalline phase, whereas W was low in the Ca-poor noncrystalline phase.

In
the artificial biomineralization of HA skeletal materials, the
Ca-poor, noncrystalline phase with low W did not
contain amorphous HA. Instead, it was a hypercomplex network in the
dry state and a hypercomplex gel in the HA solution.10−12 The hypercomplex network was composed of the proton donor polymer
PVA, the proton acceptor polymer PAA, and HPO42– as well as Ca2+ ions joined by electrostatic and hydrogen
bonding interactions (Figure 1a).

Therefore, it will be natural to also describe the
H phase of the
present system as a hypercomplex structure without amorphous CC. A
schematic of the elemental structure of the hypercomplex network in
CC artificial biomineralization is given in Figure 1c. As carbonic acid takes the dominant form
of HCO3– in a pH = 7.5 solution,32 it can be adsorbed on the polymer chain of the
hydrogel. The −OH of HCO3– will
be a proton donor to the −CO2– of PAA, and the other oxygen of HCO3– will accept the proton from −OH of PVA. When this adsorption
of HCO3– occurs, Ca2+ can
be concomitantly absorbed within the polymer gel by electrostatic
interaction to neutralize 2 HCO3– ions.
In addition to this adsorption of HCO3– and Ca2+, more Ca2+ can be taken into the
network by electrostatic effect to neutralize two −CO2– of PAA. This hypercomplex network will correspond
to the fundamental structure of the Ca-poor phase of the composite
in the dry state. In the CC solution, the network swells to a hypercomplex
gel to fulfil Donnan equilibrium by absorbing free Ca2+ and HCO3– from the external solution.
This hypercomplex gel will correspond to the fundamental structure
of the Ca-poor phase of the composite swollen in the CC solution.

In the artificial biomineralization of HA skeletal materials, the
Ca-rich, high-W, and crystalline phase is not simply
a solid dispersion of the polymer network and HA, but rather a solid
solution of these two (i.e., a network/HA solid solution).11 This model can be applied to the S phase of
the present system. We can determine the equilibrium state of the
S phase of composite immersed in a solution unsaturated with respect
to CC, by examining the chemical potentials of CC at the interface
between the solid composite and solution. For simplicity, we temporally
neglect the polymorphism of CC. At equilibrium, the chemical potential
of CC in the solid composite equals that of CC in the unsaturated
solution (designated as μ). Meanwhile, the chemical potential
of CC in the saturated solution is equal to the standard chemical
potential of CC (μ0). As the solution in the present
system is unsaturated, μ < μ0. This is satisfied
when μ is expressed as μ = μ0 + RT ln a, where R is the
gas constant, T is the temperature, and a (a < 1) corresponds to the activity of CC in
the solid composite. The relation a < 1 means
that CC is miscible with the polymer network embedded in the solid
composite, namely, forming a single solid solution. In other words,
CC is a good solvent to swell the polymer network of PVA/PAA. In this
sense, the solid composite forms a “solid gel phase”.
In general, solid solutions are classified into two categories depending
on their basic structure: the substitutional and interstitial solid
solutions. For the network/CC solid solution, the model structures
of substitutional and interstitial solid solutions are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Schematic models of two
types of network/CC solid solution: (a)
substitutional solid solution and (b) interstitial solid solution.
The structural unit of CC is located on lattice points with a long-range
order.

In a substitutional solid solution,
the lattice points of CC are
partially replaced by the repeating units of the network polymer.
In an interstitial solid solution, the network polymer fits into the
space between the CC lattice points instead. Figure 6 shows ideal model structures in which the
main lattice points of CC are not dislocated. However, the presence
of the network polymer will inevitably cause slight dislocation of
the CC lattice points, no matter which structure the solid solution
takes. This slight dislocation may have affected the XRD patterns
and broadened the peaks located at Bragg angles corresponding to CC.
In the solid solution model, the polymorphism can be explained not
as a metastable state but a stable equilibrium state in which calcite-like
and vaterite-like solid solutions coexist. The chemical potential
of calcite in the solid solution, μc, is expressed
as μc = μc0 + RT ln ac, where μc0 is
the standard chemical potential of calcite and ac is its activity in the solid solution. Similarly, the chemical
potential of vaterite in the solid solution can be expressed as μv = μv0 + RT ln av. The coexistence condition for CC, μc = μv, means μc0 + RT ln ac = μv0 + RT ln av, where μc0 < μv0 because calcite is more stable
than vaterite. This leads to av = ac exp[(μc0 – μv0)/RT] < ac, which means that vaterite is stabilized by its affinitive interaction
with the polymer network to a larger extent than calcite does.

The change from the Ca-poor phase to the Ca-rich phase of the composite
is discontinuous. Because of the aforementioned considerations of
the phase structures, this change in the composite can be regarded
as a phase transition from the hypercomplex gel, in which the polymer
network is miscible with the CC solution, to the solid solution in
which the polymer network is miscible with solid CC. Formally, this
transition accompanies hydrolysis and can be written as 1  where { } means the hypercomplex gel and {
}SS means the solid solution. Moreover, this transition
occurs in an open system, whose border is permeable to not only energy
but also mass (ions and water). Although this formulation of the phase
transition model is identical to that of the HA artificial biomineralization
system, the initiation point of phase transition is different between
the two. In HA artificial biomineralization, it begins at the middle
depth of the hypercomplex gel rather than on the surface. This difference
is a problem to be solved in the future.

Then, we compare our
artificial biomineralization system with the
natural system. By substituting PVA in artificial HA biomineralization
with collagen and PAA with chondroitin sulfate, Figure 1a gives the polymer network and hypercomplex
network shown in Figure 1b. The polymer network is formed through hydrogen bonding, where
the −OH of hydroxyproline residue on water-insoluble collagen
acts as a proton donor, whereas the dissociated −OSO3– in chondroitin sulfate acts as a proton acceptor.
In the hypercomplex network of (b), the −OH of HPO42– will be a proton donor to the −OSO3– of chondroitin sulfate, and the other
oxygen of HPO42– will accept protons
from the −OH of collagen. In addition to HPO42–, Ca2+ can be adsorbed onto HPO42– and −OSO3– in the hypercomplex network. We propose that this HA hypercomplex
gel can represent the fundamental structure of the cartilaginous tissue,
whereas the solid solution of this collagen/chondroitin sulfate polymer
network and HA can represent the fundamental structure of HA skeletal
tissue. This hypercomplex is the only structure model of the cartilaginous
tissue at the molecular level as far as the author knows.

Hereafter,
the cartilaginous tissue associated with the CC skeletal
tissue will be referred to as CC cartilage, as distinct from the usual
vertebrate HA cartilage that is associated with the HA skeletal tissue.
The cranial cartilage of squid is a kind of CC cartilage and contains
collagen33 and chondroitin sulfate.34 The squid pen, another CC cartilage, contains
collagen, chitin, and acidic polymers.35 Some types of squids have CC skeletal tissue rather than the squid
pen. This tissue, called the cuttlebone, also contains collagen, chitin,
and acidic polymers16 as well as CC. These
findings imply the presence of a polymer network in both CC cartilaginous
and CC skeletal tissues of squids, similar to the presence of a polymer
network in both HA cartilaginous and skeletal tissues (Table 1, Figure 1b). The network in the squid system will
consist of both neutral polymers such as collagen and chitin, and
acidic polymers such as chondroitin sulfate. The neutral and acidic
polymers are combined by hydrogen bonding interaction, where the −OH
of hydroxyproline residue in collagen or −OH and −NH–
in chitin will act as proton donors, whereas the dissociated −OSO3– in chondroitin sulfate will act as proton
acceptors (Figure 1d) in the same way as Figure 1b (or the −SO3– against
−NH2 in the double-network gel).36 In the CC hypercomplex network of (d), the −OH of
HCO3– will be a proton donor to the −OSO3– of chondroitin sulfate, and the other
oxygen of HCO3– will accept protons from
the −OH of collagen. In addition to HCO3–, Ca2+ can be adsorbed onto HCO3– and −OSO3– in the hypercomplex
network. Instead of PAA in the CC solution, in biological systems
the acidic proteins are dissociated and suppress the activity of CC,
so that the solution is unsaturated with respect to CC.

Then,
the fundamental structure of CC cartilage of squid in its
dry state can be regarded as a CC hypercomplex network (Figure 1d). Furthermore, the fundamental
structure of cuttlebone can be regarded as a solid solution of this
polymer network and CC. The precursor of the cuttlebone was found
to contain a chitin–protein complex.37 We assume this precursor to be also a CC cartilaginous tissue, that
is, a hypercomplex gel based on the polymer network that consists
of chitin and acidic protein. Following this thinking, the formation
of cuttlebone from its precursor can be explained as the phase transition
of the CC hypercomplex gel to a network/CC solid solution.

The
CC skeletal tissue of mollusk shells contains chitin, silk-fibroin-like
protein, and collagen-like conchiolin as water-nonsoluble polymers,
and acidic polymers as water-soluble polymers (Table 1).17,18 In this system, the
water-nonsoluble polymers will act as proton donors, and are bound
by hydrogen bonding interaction with water-soluble polymers that act
as a proton acceptor to form a polymer network. The formation process
of the mollusk shell has been investigated in detail by microscopic
analysis. Nacre comprises thick layers of tablets that have an aragonite
structure. Weiss et al. reported that the tablets are formed in larval
bivalves from a noncrystalline precursor.38 They found that the aragonite fraction grew larger via transformation
of the noncrystalline fraction in a hydrogel that contained chitin
and silk-fibroin-like protein.39 The Raman
spectrum of the noncrystalline precursor shows the peak of stretching
mode of carbonate at 1087 cm–1 but not the lattice
mode of carbonate in CC. The hypercomplex network shown here in Figure 1d is consistent with
the result of their Raman spectrum analysis. Hence, the precursor
will be regarded as a CC-based hypercomplex gel. In this model, transformation
of the noncrystalline fraction into the aragonite fraction can be
explained as the phase transition of the CC hypercomplex gel into
a network/CC solid solution. The CC hypercomplex gel will appear as
the CC cartilaginous tissue. In fact, the presence of jelly-like substance
in shells certainly has been reported in conjunction with the thickening
process of shells.40

The embryo of
sea urchin contains collagen evolutionarily homologous
to vertebrate collagen19 and acidic glycoproteins.20 These facts also imply the existence of a polymer
network for mineralization that contains collagen (proton donor) and
acidic glycoprotein (proton acceptor) combined with each other by
hydrogen bonding interaction (Figure 1d and Table 1). During the generation or regeneration of sea urchin spine,
precursor formation has been observed by SEM. The precursor, which
contains calcium, carbonate, and water, shows no spot in the electron
diffraction pattern, indicating that it is not crystalline.41,42 The precursor is transformed into the calcite skeletal tissue of
sea urchin spine. Assuming this noncrystalline tissue to be a CC cartilage
composed of the polymer network with both Ca2+ and HCO3– as in the shell system (Figure 1d), the formation of sea urchin
spine can be explained as the phase transition of the CC hypercomplex
gel (cartilaginous tissue) into the network/CC solid solution (skeletal
tissue).

These examples indicate that, in different kinds of
organisms,
the CC skeletal tissues are formed from the cartilaginous precursor
and the transformation of the cartilaginous tissue into the CC skeletal
tissue is a phase transition of the CC hypercomplex gel to a network/CC
solid solution. It is natural to suppose this mechanism in other CC
biomineralization systems. Furthermore, we would like to extend our
model to the silica biomineralization system. The spicule of sponge
contains spongin (a collagenous protein), chitin, as well as amorphous
silica.21,43 The biosilica of a diatom cell wall contains
glycoproteins that has hydroxyproline residues.22 Another organic polymer isolated from the biosilica of
the diatom cell wall is sillafin-2, a polyanionic phosphoprotein.23 Therefore, a polymer network can exist in silica
biomineralization and is composed of spongin, chitin, or the glycoprotein
as neutral polymers and sillafin-2 as an acidic polymer. The neutral
and acidic polymers will be combined by hydrogen bonding interaction,
where the −OH of the hydroxyproline residue in water-insoluble
collagenous polymer (or −OH and −NH– in water-insoluble
chitin) will act as a proton donor, whereas the dissociated −OPO3H– in sillafin-2 will act as a proton acceptor
(Figure 1f).

Hence, we argue that the network of PVA/PAA utilized in the present
study should be applicable as the polymer network to artificial silica
biomineralization. Low-molecular-weight polycationic sillafin-1 also
has been isolated from the diatom biosilica. When this polymer is
dissolved in an external silica solution under acidic pH, the polycation
can dissociate and suppress the activity of silica so that the latter
is unsaturated in the solution. As an analogue of this polymer, low-molecular-weight
poly(allylamine) could be adopted in the artificial silica biomineralization
system. In the proposed artificial system of Figure 1e, a PVA/PAA network is immersed in Na2SiO3 aq. solution that should have weak acidic
pH, in which metasilicic acid has the dominant form of HSiO3–, whereas dissociated poly(allylamine) suppresses
the activity of silica to keep it unsaturated in the solution. The
network swells to become a hypercomplex gel, in which the Na+ and HSiO3– will be adsorbed on the
polymer chain in a manner similar to the case of HA and the CC hypercomplex
gel. This hypercomplex gel will change to a solid solution of PVA/PAA
and amorphous silica (i.e., network/silica solid solution) via phase
transition in an open system, under the appropriate PVA/PAA composition
and Na2SiO3 concentration. The model structure
of this solid solution is depicted in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. This transition accompanies
pro forma dehydration, and can be written as 2  

In transition 2, the pH is acidic, the reaction
is dehydration, and the polyelectrolyte in external solution is cationic,
the opposite of those in transition 1 (basic,
hydrolysis, and anionic, respectively). If this phase transition can
be realized experimentally, then this system can be regarded as an
artificial silica biomineralization system that is analogous to the
natural system. According to this model, the precursor of biosilica
can also be regarded as a hypercomplex gel (Figure 1f). It will be worthwhile to search for such
tissues during the silica biomineralization process of diatoms and
sponge. So far, we have proven that the phase transition of the hypercomplex
gel to the solid solution of a polymer network/mineral can be considered
the mechanism of both HA biomineralization10−12 and CC biomineralization.
If this phase transition mechanism can be extended to silica biomineralization
with experimental proofs, it would become a unified mechanism for
all three biomineralization systems.

Conclusions
Solid
solution systems of metal/metal (alloy), polymer/polymer
(polymer alloy), and mineral/mineral (mixed crystal) are well known.
In this study, we have introduced a new category of important solid
solution systems, namely, the polymer network/mineral solid solution,
to describe the fundamental structures of a polymer network/mineral
composite synthesized in a solution unsaturated with respect to the
mineral. As CC crystal cannot be formed in its unsaturated solution,
our solid composite cannot be a dispersion of a polymer network in
CC phases. This is a reason why we introduced the solid solution model.
This dense solid solution is formed throughout the original gel via
the phase transition of a hypercomplex gel that is a polymer network
swollen in the mineral solution. This system can explain the components,
structure, and formation process of skeletal and cartilaginous tissues
in biological systems. At least, the HA and CC skeletal tissues have
noncrystalline precursors, and these skeletal tissues and their precursors
contain a network of proton donor and proton acceptor polymers. These
facts are reflected in our artificial biomineralization system. Therefore,
the fundamental structure of skeletal tissues will be regarded as
a polymer network/mineral solid solution, whereas that of cartilaginous
noncrystalline tissue will be regarded as a hypercomplex gel that
is a polymer network swollen in the mineral solution. We believe that
our model can be extended to cover the silica biomineralization system.
This unified model, if experimentally validated, may provide a new
insight into the evolution of skeletal and cartilaginous tissues.
Furthermore, it will offer a guiding principle to develop exotic skeletal
materials with mineral components other than HA, CC, or silica. Functional
polymers also can be adopted in these exotic skeletal materials. For
examples, when a double-network gel is adopted as the polymer matrix,
a very tough skeletal or cartilaginous material can be manufactured;
and utilizing electroconductive gel44 as
the polymer matrix can result in electroconductive skeletal or cartilaginous
materials. Thus, many fascinating problems remain to be explored.

Experimental
Section
Chitosan (a degree of deacetylation of 75–85%
and a viscosity
of 5–20 cps by the Brookfield method using 1% solution in 1%
acetic acid) as a proton donor component of a polymer network, and
two types of PAA (molecular weight Mw =
ca. 250 kDa as a proton acceptor component of a polymer network and
2 kDa as a polyelectrolyte component of salt solution) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Two network components, namely, PVA
(degree of polymerization around 2000) as a proton donor and PAA (Mw = ca. 5 kDa) as a proton acceptor, sodium
chloride (NaCl), calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O), and sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) were
purchased from WAKO Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.

The chitosan/PAA
network (chitosan/PAA), PVA/PAA physically cross-linked
network (PVA/PAA-p), and PVA/PAA chemically cross-linked network (PVA/PAA-c)
were prepared by the method described in detail in previous reports.12 Chitosan/PAA was prepared by mixing water-insoluble
chitosan and water-soluble PAA (Mw ≈
5 kDa) solutions at the polymer weight ratio of 2:1 under an acidic
condition. After drying, this network film turned out to be insoluble
without further treatment in the CC solution. PVA/PAA-p was prepared
by repeated freezing–thawing of a mixed solution of water-soluble
PVA and PAA (Mw ≈ 250 kDa), introducing
fine-crystalline PVA to avoid the dissolution of PVA or the network.12 In the preparation of PVA/PAA-c, PVA and PAA
(Mw ≈ 250 kDa) solutions were mixed
in the polymer weight ratio of 3:2. Then, after drying, the polymer
film was cross-linked by heat treatment under reduced pressure to
introduce esterification to stabilize the network.45

We prepared aqueous CC solutions (200 mL) containing
CaCl2 at x mM, NaHCO3 at x mM (x ≤ 30), PAA (Mw ≈ 2 kDa) at 0.14 mM in terms of the repeating
unit,
and NaCl at 140 mM. The pH of this solution was around 7.5. The high
concentrations of source ions Ca2+ and HCO3– in the solution were maintained by the PAA: precipitation
occurred in the absence of PAA, whereas in its presence the solution
remained transparent for more than 1 week even at 30 °C and x = 30. In this way, PAA in the solution clearly raised
the precipitation threshold of CC. Hence, these solutions were unsaturated
with respect to CC even when the source ion concentrations exceed
the saturation level of CC in pure water. This is because the electrostatic
potential of dissociated polyelectrolytes (PAA at 2 kDa) in the solution
induces local charge separation between the cations and anions.46,47 Therefore, the activity of CC, a, can be suppressed
to below unity (a < 1). Thus, our CC solution
can act as a compact reservoir of ions for CC mineralization because
of its high concentration of ions. Without the PAA, the ion concentrations
in unsaturated reservoir should be decreased, requiring a huge reservoir
volume to contain enough ions for artificial biomineralization to
proceed.

A circular piece of the polymer network film with 1
cm radius was
immersed in 200 mL of the CC solution prepared in a glass beaker,
which was covered with a sealing film and thermostated at 30 °C.
As mineralization proceeded, the concentrations of source ions Ca2+ and HCO3– in the solution were
aperiodically adjusted to keep them as constant as possible by renewing
the solution. After an appropriate interval, the polymer network changed
to an organic/inorganic composite. The composite was taken out of
the solution, and rinsed three times in pure water for 10 min to remove
residual free soluble ions.

The dry weight uptake, W, corresponds to the weight
percent of inorganic constituents in the obtained organic/inorganic
composite: W = 100(M – M0)/M, where M0 and M are the dry weights of the initial
network and obtained composite, respectively. The swelling degree
of the composite, Sw, was determined as Sw = 100(M′ – M)/M, where M′ is the weight of the composite swollen in water
at 30 °C.

XRD patterns of the composites were obtained
with a MiniFlex II
diffractometer (Rigaku Co.). The composite based on chitosan/PAA-p
was embedded in curable resin, and the ones based on PVA/PAA-c were
sandwiched with silicon wafers for support. The composites were cut
together with the support medium by ion beam polishing to make their
cross section as flat as possible. An electroconductive coating was
carried out on the composites, with a carbon layer of ca. 2 nm for
the composite based on chitosan/PAA-p and a platinum layer of ca.
3 nm for that based on PVA/PAA-c. The coated samples were used for
the SEM observation, and the subsequent analysis of the distribution
profile of principal elements (Ca, C, and O) across a representative
cross-sectional line was carried out by EDX.

It is difficult
to directly evaluate the state of composites in
situ, that is, in the CC solution. Instead, the obtained composites
were evaluated in their dry state. From the evaluation results and
the swelling degree, we will estimate the state of composites under
their artificial biomineralization conditions, which are expected
to be close to the natural biomineralization condition.
