A strategy for the
preparation of bioactive poly-ether-ether-ketone/hydroxyapatite
(PEEK/HA) composites was proposed in this study with the aim of controlling
the biological and mechanical properties of different parts of the
composites. The strategy integrated solvent-based extrusion freeforming
3D printing technology in order to print high-resolution HA scaffolds
and compression molding processes for the production of bioactive
PEEK/HA composites. To this end, an optimized model, established using
response surface methodology, was employed to optimize the extrusion
process parameters on the basis of accurate characterization of the
extrusion pressure, and the effects of the filament/pore sizes on
the PEEK infiltration depth into the HA scaffold were investigated.
The results of scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography
analyses revealed that the PEEK/HA composites exhibited a uniform
microstructure and a good interface between the HA filaments and the
PEEK matrix following the optimization of the process parameters.
The HA scaffolds were fully infiltrated by PEEK in both vertical and
lateral directions with an infiltration depth of 3 mm while maintaining
the HA network structure and uniformity. The biological and mechanical
performance test results validated that the PEEK/HA composites possessed
excellent biocompatibility as well as yields and compressive strengths
within the range of human cortical bone suitable for load-bearing
applications.

1 Introduction
A strong
demand will continue to grow for bone injury repair or
replacement owing to an increase in the aging population as well as
industry, transport, sports, and other causes, because bone repair
or replacement can improve the quality of life of thousands of patients.
However, the defects of stress shielding or poor mechanical strength
limit bone scaffolds, especially load-bearing bone scaffolds, to wider
applications.1−3 Poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) is a high-performance,
semicrystalline thermoplastic that is an excellent alternative for
metal biomaterials because it has good biocompatibility with no cytotoxic
effects in vivo. The elastic modulus of PEEK is similar to that of
cortical bone,4−8 which has been used as a load-bearing orthopedic implant material
with clinical applications in recent years. However, despite its widespread
use in bone damage repair, a potential clinical concern is that PEEK
is not bioactive enough and has limited fixation with bone, which
means that smooth PEEK implants fabricated by conventional manufacturing
methods can exhibit poor osseointegration and potentially result in
clinical failure.3 Therefore, manufacturing
PEEK-based implants is an extremely challenging task.

To improve
the osseointegration of PEEK-based implants, three main
strategies have been developed for different orthopedic applications:
(1) the incorporation of bioactive materials such as calcium phosphates
or hydroxyapatite (HA) into PEEK with the potential for osseointegration,9,10 (2) coating PEEK implants with biomaterials such as titanium or
HA,11−13 and (3) incorporating porosity into PEEK implants.3,14,15 Of these three main strategies,
the addition of bioactive materials along with the incorporation of
porosity into PEEK has been identified as an effective approach for
improving bone–implant interfaces and for the osseointegration
of PEEK-based devices.1 Many manufacturing
methods such as compounding and injection molding and cold press sintering
have been used to produce bioactive PEEK/HA composites.16−18 A number of researchers have reported that the addition of bioactive
phase materials and the incorporation of porosity into PEEK are effective
approaches for improving the bone–implant interfaces and for
the osseointegration of PEEK-based implants.1−3,9,10,14,15,19−26 However, the conventional addition method often mixes bioactive
materials with PEEK. For example, Yuan and co-authors hand mixed HA
microspheres and PEEK powder and then prepared PEEK/HA composite samples
under heat and pressure. Porous PEEK samples were prepared after soaking
PEEK/HA composites in an HCl solution to remove the HA microspheres.20,21 In this way, it signifies that the size and location of the pores
in porous PEEK are uncontrollable, which means that the biological
and mechanical properties of PEEK-based implants cannot be controlled.

Among the many strategies developed to solve the above problems,
Yang’s research team proposed a novel approach for the production
of bioactive PEEK/HA bone scaffolds with a unique configuration in
which the bioactive material HA distribution is computer-controlled
within a PEEK matrix.22−26 In this manner, the biological and mechanical properties of different
parts of the bone scaffolds can be controlled macroscopically. This
novel approach has low cost, and there is no theoretical limit to
the proportion of bioactive materials added. However, the crux of
the preparation of bioactive PEEK/HA bone scaffolds with the required
performance is the accurate control of the process parameters such
as the accurate characterization of the extrusion pressure and optimizing
both the 3D printer system and its printing parameters. Poor control
of the process parameters would result in a failure of the bone scaffold
preparations because bone scaffolds must have a highly controlled
3D macrostructure and microstructure to accurately mimic the native
tissue environment. A scaffold may have simple or complicated macrostructures
depending on the application, but its microstructure is the factor
that affects the regeneration of specific tissues using synthetic
substances.26 In addition, there must be
a good bonding interface between the HA filaments and the PEEK matrix
in order to improve the osseointegration ability of PEEK-based bone
scaffolds.

In this study, a strategy for the preparation of
bioactive PEEK/HA
composites was investigated by optimizing the process parameters in
order to accurately control the properties of bioactive PEEK/HA composites
on the basis of our previous research.26 For this purpose, an optimized model established using response
surface methodology (RSM) based on Box–Behnken design (BBD)
was employed to optimize the extrusion process parameters on the basis
of accurate characterization of the extrusion pressure. The effects
of the filament/pore sizes on the PEEK infiltration depth into the
HA scaffold were investigated. After that, the microstructures and
the bonding interface between HA and PEEK were analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and computed tomography (CT) techniques,
and the biological and mechanical properties of the composites were
tested. This study aims to present results that can serve as a guide
for the preparation of bioactive PEEK/HA composites suitable for bone
tissue engineering scaffold applications by accurately controlling
the properties of bioactive PEEK/HA composites.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Fabricating Method
The method used
to fabricate bioactive PEEK/HA composites with controlled biological
and mechanical properties is presented in Figure 1. Porous bioactive HA scaffolds were first
fabricated using solvent-based extrusion freeforming (SEF) 3D printing
technology, after which PEEK melt was infiltrated into the HA scaffolds
using the compression molding process. The biological and mechanical
properties could be tailored by varying the percentage of bioactive
HA materials (such as by varying the HA filament and/or pore sizes).
The detailed fabricating method is presented in Table S1.

Figure 1 Preparation method of bioactive PEKK/HA composite and
porous PEEK
in our study.

In contrast to the method shown
in refs (20) and (21), the method illustrated
in Figure 1 can control
the biological and mechanical
properties of different parts of PEEK/HA composites because the HA
filament and/or pore sizes can be arbitrarily controlled using SEF
3D printing technology according to different applications. For example,
the use of HA scaffold with computer-controlled varied spacing can
make functionally graded PEEK/HA composites for spinal cage fusion,22,25 and the distribution of bioactive phase materials HA by computer-control
in these composites also ensured uniform distribution of the load
onto the device after implantation.

2.2 Fabricating
Materials
The following
materials were used to form a PEEK/HA composite in this study: (1)
HA powder (Grade P221 S, Plasma Biotal Ltd. UK), (2) adhesive binder
polyvinyl butyral (Grade BN18, Whacker Chemicals, UK), (3) plasticizer
polyethyleneglycol (Whacker Chemicals, UK), (4) propan-2-ol (Fisher
Scientific, UK), and (5) PEEK OPTIMA LT3 UF (Invibio Biomaterials
Solutions, UK), as shown in Table 1. Of these, materials (1)–(4) were used to form
the ceramic pastes for the 3D printing HA scaffold, and material (5)
was used to produce a PEEK/HA composite through a compression molding
process.

Composite in This Study
2.3 Optimization Method of Extrusion Process Parameters
From Figure 1, it
can be observed that the successful printing of HA scaffold with SEF
technology is very important for the preparation of bioactive PEEK/HA
composite. In our previous research,26 a
novel method, namely, the three-point experimental extrapolation,
was executed to analyze the necessary extrusion pressure in relation
to the extrusion velocity. On this basis, to find the optimal printing
parameters and reduce the extrusion pressure as much as possible,
an RSM based on BBD was employed to optimize the extrusion process
parameters. An RSM is an effective mathematical and statistical tool
based on the fit of a polynomial equation to the experimental data,
which can be used to optimize multifaceted processes and evaluate
the effects of multiple variables and their interactions.27,28 It has been successfully used to optimize multiple parameters in
many areas,27−33 but the optimization of printing parameters in SEF technology for
bone scaffolds has not been reported.

In this study, three selected
independent printing parameter variables, that is, the paste formulation
(solvent content), the nozzle length-to-diameter ratio (L/D), and the extrusion velocity (V) were chosen as the critical variables and, respectively, designated
as A, B, and C,
as tabulated in Table 2. The levels of each variable were, respectively, designated as −1,
0, and +1. All experiments were carried out in a random order using
different parameters, and the low and high levels of the factors were
selected according to our previous experiments.26

Table 2 Experimental Range and Levels of Independent
Variables
 	 	 	range and levels (codes)	
variables	symbol	unit	–1 (low level)	0 (center level)	1 (high level)

L/D	B	 	32	79.5	127	
velocity (V)	C	mm/s	2.7	5.35	8.0	
The extrusion
pressure was multiply regressed with respect to the
different printing parameters using the least squares method, as follows28 1  where y is the response variable
(here, it is the extrusion pressure P), xi and xj are the independent printing parameter variables
(here, these are A, B, and C), k is the number of tested variables
(here, k = 3), and ε is the residual, which
is used to adjust the regression accuracy. The regression coefficient
is defined as β0 for the intercept, βi for linear terms, βii for quadratic terms, and βij for crossproduct terms. Therefore, the regression model initially
established in this study was as shown in eq 2. 2  

An RSM experiment
based on a BBD was used to optimize the extrusion
process. Seventeen experiments were designed by Design-Expert 8.0
software for use in this study. The statistical testing of the regression
equation was checked by F-test and the analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for the fitted quadratic polynomial model of the
extrusion pressure. The regression model established after optimization
was as shown in eq 3.
The detailed analysis results will be discussed in the next section. 3  

2.4 Optimization of Compression Molding Parameters
SEM
and CT techniques play an important role in microstructure
analysis.34−39 In this study, a series of HA scaffolds with a range of filament
and pore sizes were 3D printed and subsequently overmolded to investigate
the effects of the filament/pore sizes on the PEEK infiltration depth
into the HA scaffold. The samples were cut using a diamond cutter
(Mecatome T210, Presi, France). The infiltration depth was measured
with the use of optical microscopy (Olympus BH2-UMA, Japan). SEM (JEOL
JSM-6500F, Oxford Instruments) and CT (Custom 225 kV Nikon/Metris
HMX ST) were used for the analysis of the microstructures of the samples.
The optimal temperature and pressure were determined through experimentation
on overmolding HA scaffolds with external dimensions of 10 ×
10 × 3 mm3.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Checking the Fitted Models
and the Statistical
Analysis
ANOVA was performed for the fitted quadratic polynomial
model eqs 2 and 3 before and after optimization of the extrusion pressure
with the measured values given in Table 3. From Table 3, it can be observed that the models’ F-values of 110.73 and 193.29 before and after optimization
imply that the models were significant. There was only a 0.01% chance
that a “model F-value” this large could
occur due to noise. P-values less than 0.05 indicate
that the model terms were significant. In this case A, B, C, AB, BC, and B2 were significant
model terms. Values greater than 0.1000 indicated that the model terms
were not significant. Therefore, the insignificant items were removed
from the regression equation after optimization. Meanwhile, it is
also observable that the pred. R2 of 0.9613
was in reasonable agreement with the adj. R2 of 0.9863 after optimization, which was better than that of before
optimization. The adeq. precision term was used to measure the signal-to-noise
ratio, for which a value greater than 4 was desirable. The ratio of
45.375 after optimization was greater than that of 35.151 before optimization.
The final regression model before and after optimization is presented
in eq 4. 4  where
the values of A, B, and C are calculated with codes of −1,
0, and 1, respectively.

Seventeen RSM experiments were inserted into equation
set (4), and the data for the two models were
compared
with the measured values. The results of this comparison are presented
in Table S2. The analysis results indicate
that the model after optimization had an adequate signal that could
be used to optimize the extrusion parameters.

3.2 Optimization
of Extrusion Process Parameters
In order to ensure the stiffness
of the 3D printing system, we
developed a SEF 3D printer with the designed maximum extrusion pressure
of 20 MPa for the printing of high-resolution scaffolds.26 According to the analysis of paste extrusion
process,26 the target values of the control
factors A, B, and C were set to 10.2 wt %, 32, and 8 mm/s, respectively. The purpose
of this setting was to increase the extrusion efficiency and to make
the paste extrude smoothly. Table 4 presents some of the optimization results.

Table 4 Some of the Optimization Results of
the Extrusion Parameters with the RSM Based on a BBD
no	solvent content (wt %)	L/D	velocity (mm/s)	extrusion

2	10.20	32.00	7.98	7.59	99.86	
3	10.22	32.00	8.00	7.59	99.84	
4	10.20	32.00	7.93	7.56	99.55	
5	10.20	32.00	7.88	7.54	99.27	
6	10.20	34.07	8.00	7.98	99.27	
7	10.20	34.40	8.00	8.04	99.15	
8	10.40	32.00	8.00	7.56	98.65	
9	10.20	36.17	8.00	8.36	98.52	
10	10.44	32.00	8.00	7.55	98.36	
From Table 4, it
is observable that extrusion pressure after optimization was much
lower than the designed maximum value. This was very advantageous
for the 3D printing system, because it meant that the printing parameters
could be set according to the optimized model to ensure printing of
the high-resolution scaffolds under high system stiffness.

The
purpose of optimizing the printing process was to determine
the microstructure of the bioactive porous scaffolds, thereby making
it beneficial for improved in vivo nutrient diffusions, the removal
of waste products, and more efficient vascularization as well as the
preparation of the PEEK/HA composites. Figure 2 depicts the influence of individual control
factors and their interactions on extrusion pressure based on the
regression model after optimization.

and their interactions

and (e) interaction of BC.

3.3 SEM and CT Analyses for HA Scaffolds and PEEK/HA
Composites
Bioactive porous HA scaffolds with different filaments
and pore sizes were printed following the optimization of the printing
parameters. The microscopic morphologies of a sintered HA scaffold
analyzed using SEM technology are presented in Figure 3a,b. The scaffolds exhibited a uniform microstructure
following the optimization of the extrusion process. The minimum diameter
of the HA filament reached 30 μm, which was the highest resolution
the bioceramic scaffold ever reported.

Figure 3 Microscopic morphology
of the typical HA and PEEK/HA composites:
(a,b) SEM image of a sintered HA scaffold with ∼30 μm
filaments and (c,d) CT image of a PEEK/HA composite.

Figure 3c,d
presents
a 3D image of a PEEK/HA composite constructed using CT technology.
The PEEK/HA composite was produced successfully through optimized
compression molding using static loading with the optimal molding
temperature and pressure of 400 °C and 0.39 MPa, respectively.
HA scaffolds were fully infiltrated by PEEK with an infiltration depth
of 3 mm, while maintaining the HA network structure and uniformity,
which meant that there was a good interface between the HA filaments
and the PEEK matrix. Figure 4 depicts the CT analysis results of the volume percentages
of PEEK/HA samples prepared using static loading.

Figure 4 CT analysis results of

The above analysis results
verify the effectiveness of the method
proposed in this study for the preparation of PEEK/HA composites to
accurately control the microstructure and generate a very consistent
and repeatable overall process.

4 Biological
and Mechanical Performance Verifications
4.1 Cell
Viability Both in HA Scaffolds and PEEK/HA
Composites
The in vitro cell viability and biocompatibility
test of the HA scaffolds and PEEK/HA samples were carried out for
the assessment of the biological performance. Figure 5a–c illustrates the cell viability
of the HA scaffold; in the figure, the red spots indicate dead cells,
the green areas indicate that the cells are alive and delineate the
boundary of each cell, and the blue stains indicate the nuclei of
the cells. Excellent cell adhesion and viability were observed by
a cell tracker green/ethidium homodimer staining within 1 day, as
shown in Figure 5a.
The cells tended to row/bridge from one portion of a filament to the
adjacent filament after just 1 day, as presented in Figure 5b. Widespread cell growth,
proliferation, and pores filling were observed at 7 days, as displayed
in Figure 5c. SEM imaging
in Figure 5d revealed
cell surface interaction and adhesion among the HA surface, the PEEK/HA
boundary, and the interface of PEEK surface roughness variations.
The results of biological tests confirmed excellent biocompatibility.

and mechanical performance verifications: (a) cultured
cells in HA scaffold within 1 day, (b) cultured cells in HA scaffold
after 1 day, (c) cultured cells in HA scaffold at 7 days, (d) SEM
imaging of the cell surface interaction and adhesion at PEEK/HA composite
after 7 days, (e) measured stress–strain curve, and (f) comparison
of compressive strength.

4.2 Compression
Test of the PEEK/HA Composites
PEEK/HA composites with mechanical
strength that is too strong
or too weak are inappropriate for load-bearing bone applications.
To verify the mechanical properties of the composites prepared in
this study method, the parameters of the PEEK/HA were designed based
on the mechanical properties of the human cortical bone. HA scaffolds
with filament sizes of 400 μm and pore sizes of 700 μm
were 3D printed and overmolded with PEEK using the procedure described
in this study. The produced PEEK/HA samples were cut at sizes of 6 ×
6 × 6 mm3 using a diamond cutter and subjected to
further CT analysis. The samples with average HA volume percentages
of 40% were subjected to unconfined, uniaxial compression tests using
an Instron 8032 test machine at strain rate of 3 × 10–3/s. A 100 kN load cell was used, and the test data were collected
using Instron’s StrainSmart 6200 software. Six samples were
tested for reproducibility. The unfilled PEEK samples with 0% HA were
also printed and tested as a control.

The mechanical testing
results are presented in Figure 5e,f, where the data for human cortical bone were taken
from ref (40). As seen
in Figure 5f, the PEEK/HA
possessed yields and compressive strengths within the range of the
human cortical bone, which is an advantage compared to metal biomaterials.
The mismatched mechanical strength of metal biomaterials with bone
can cause stress shielding. However, the biological and mechanical
properties of PEEK/HA composites prepared in this study can be adjusted
by controlling the filament and/or pore size of HA with a computer-controlled
distribution for different load-bearing or non-loadbearing applications.

5 Conclusions
(1) A promising strategy was developed
for the preparation of bioactive PEEK/HA composites with the aim of
controlling the biological and mechanical properties of different
parts of the composites. The strategy integrated SEF 3D printing technology
to print high-resolution HA scaffolds and compression molding processes
for the production of bioactive PEEK/HA composites.

(2) An optimized model established using
RSM was employed to optimize the extrusion process parameters. The
experimental results indicated that the extrusion pressure after optimization
was much lower than the target value, which meant that the printing
parameters could be set according to the optimized model under high
system stiffness. The optimization method in this study for bone scaffolds
has not been reported.

(3) The SEM and CT analysis results indicated
that the bioactive PEEK/HA composites exhibited a uniform microstructure
and a good interface between the HA filaments and the PEEK matrix
following the optimization of the process parameters. This verifies
the effectiveness of the method proposed in this study in accurately
controlling the microstructure and generating a very consistent and
repeatable overall process.

(4) The biological and mechanical performance
test results confirmed that the PEEK/HA composites possessed excellent
biocompatibility as well as yields and compressive strengths, within
the range of the human cortical bone, suitable for load-bearing applications,
which validated the ability of the strategy to accurately control
the properties of bioactive PEEK/HA composites.
