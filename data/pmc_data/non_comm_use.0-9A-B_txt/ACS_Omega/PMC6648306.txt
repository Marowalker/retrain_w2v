This
work is motivated to explore the structural stability and
electronic and electrochemical properties of nanocomposites of M4Lin (M = Si and Ge)–carbon
nanotube (CNT) by employing first-principles density functional theory
calculations. By analyzing the structural stability of various M4Lin (n = 0–10)
clusters, it is revealed that a tetrahedron-shaped M4Li4 Zintl cluster is found to be highly stable. Our study on
the interaction between the lithiated clusters and CNT illustrates
that the charge transfer from the former to latter plays a pivotal
role in stabilizing these nanocomposites. The structural stability
of those nanocomposites arises as a consequence of bonding between
lithiated clusters and CNT, which is mediated through the cation−π
interaction. The strength of the interaction between them is well
reflected in electronic structure calculations by shifting the energy
levels with respect to the Fermi energy. Further, the electrochemical
properties of these nanocomposites are explored by forming an assembly
of the cluster-inserted CNT. The calculated average intercalation
voltage of the systems is found to be low (maximum ∼1.0 V for
M = Si and 1.05 V for M = Ge), which demonstrates their anodic behavior.

Introduction
At present, rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) emerge as
an irrefutable power source for portable electronic and electrical
devices.1,2 Because of its various salient features
such as high capacity, better operational voltage, and compact size,
the LIB outperforms other conventional energy storage devices.3 Even though LIBs are well commercialized long
back, further improvements in their components are still considered
as an important task to achieve the fast growing demands in large-scale
electrical automobiles.4 Especially, the
well-commercialized anode material is graphite; however, the theoretical
specific capacity is limited to 372 mAh/g, as the result of the structural
restriction of graphite, which leads to form the LiC6 compound.5,6 In this perspective, other group IV elements, such as, silicon,
germanium, and tin are well attracted among the researchers because
these materials possess higher theoretical capacity than that of graphite.7 However, it is well known that all these materials
undergo an enormous volume expansion when they are alloyed with Li
ions. This leads to affect the battery performance by losing the contact
between electrode and current collector.8−10 In addition, it is observed
that the interparticle electronic conductivity of the electrode material
is significantly reduced during battery cycling as the consequence
of volume expansion.11 Hence, it is unequivocally
considered that the practical implementation of bulk phase Si/Ge/Sn
as such in LIBs is not possible.

The most common strategies
adopted to nullify the effect of volume
change in the anode of the LIB are particle size reduction of electrode
materials and/or by making carbon composite of these materials.12−17 Because of the superior electronic and mechanical properties of
the carbon nanostructures, the second approach is widely considered.
Among various carbon nanostructures, carbon nanotube (CNT) is the
one which is considered as an excellent option for making nanocomposite
anode materials for LIBs.18,19 The porosity and one-dimensional
structure of CNT significantly help to reduce the volume expansion
in such composites during battery cycling.20,21 Toward this direction, in the recent past, Yu et al.22 synthesized Si nanoparticle-filled CNT, and
this nanocomposite shows an excellent specific capacity of 1750 mA
h/g. In addition, the volume expansion of a Si nanoparticle during
alloying with lithium is effectively shielded by the CNT matrix. In
a similar fashion, few reports23−25 suggest that the hybrid material
consisting of Ge/Sn and carbon nanostructures can be used as anode
of LIB. Even though lithium diffusion in Ge is relatively faster as
compared with Si, this nanocomposite is not well established, owing
to its high cost. To the best of our knowledge, the atomistic understanding
of Si/Ge nanoparticle incorporated CNT system is not well studied
so far. Considering this, here we explored the structural, electronic,
and electrochemical properties of M–Li–CNT (M = Si and
Ge) composites by employing first-principles density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. Our results show that lithiated Si4 and Ge4 clusters are strongly bonded with CNT, through
cation−π interaction as observed in our earlier work
on Sn–Li–CNT nanocomposites.26 The strength of adsorption between them is well reflected in the
electronic structures of those nanocomposites. The calculated average
intercalation voltage (AIV) of the nanocomposites manifests that they
are suitable for the anode of LIBs.

Results and Discussion
For modeling the nanocomposites M4Lin–CNT (M = Si and Ge), we initially considered the cluster
having four atoms. The calculated structural and electronic properties
of these clusters are compared with that of Sn4Lin clusters, which is studied in our previous work.26 From our preliminary calculations, it is clear
that in the ground state, both Si4 and Ge4 clusters
prefer to be in rhombus geometry similar to the Sn4 cluster.
Our results are well consistent with previous reports.27,28 The deduced electronic density of states (DOS) of these clusters
(shown in Figure S1, the Supporting Information) suggest that the Si4 cluster could be the more stable
one as the bonding 3p states, next lower to highest-occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) level, is nondegenerated. On the other hand, for Ge4 and Sn4 clusters, respective 4p and 5p states
are almost degenerated and they are predominantly located in higher
energy region as compared to Si cluster. Therefore, the stability
of these two clusters is expected to be lesser than that of Si4 atomic cluster (refer Figure 2).

Further, Li atoms are introduced on these
stable rhombus-shaped
clusters to form M4Lin clusters
(n = 1–10). Here, for deriving the stable
structures of M4Lin clusters,
we considered the models of various atomic clusters reported in the
previous studies.29−33 The optimized geometries of the stable lithiated clusters are presented
in Figures 1 and S2
(Supporting Information). In addition,
the other local minima structures of various lithiated clusters are
also provided in Figures S3–S8 (Supporting Information). It is observed that during lithiation, the rhombus-shaped
clusters are slowly bent into a closed shape, and they attain perfect
tetrahedral geometry when n = 4 (refer Figure 1). Both Si4Lin and Ge4Lin clusters possess almost similar geometry in all the cases.
On the other hand, the structure of Sn4Lin clusters in few cases are fairly different (refer Figure 1). Especially for
Sn4Lin clusters, it has been
realized that the tetrahedron-shaped geometry is converted into a
butterfly-like one (n > 4), by breaking one of
its
Sn–Sn bonds. This is consistent with our previous study.26 In contrast, for both Si4Li6 and Ge4Li6 clusters, the tetrahedral unit
exists up to n = 6. The structure of Si4Li6/Ge4Li6 cluster consists of interconnected
Li4 and Si4/Ge4 tetrahedral units,
and remaining two Li atoms occupy on two faces of the Si4/Ge4 cluster as shown in Figure 1. A similar structural difference between
Sn4Li10 and Si4Li10/Ge4Li10 clusters is also noticed.

Figure 1 Optimized structures
of stable Si4Lin, Ge4Lin, and Sn4Lin clusters are given three rows
(a–d,e–h,i–l), respectively. The n value of cluster varies from 4, 6, 8, and 10 (in column wise).

Further, to understand the structural
stability, we calculated
the binding energy (BE) per atom and the highest-occupied molecular
orbital–lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO)
energy gap of all clusters. The BE is deduced from 1  where E(M) and E(Li) are the atomic energies of Si/Ge/Sn and Li atoms,
respectively. E(M4Lin) corresponds
to total energies of the lithiated cluster. As expected, the HOMO–LUMO
gap of M4Lin clusters with
an odd n value is found to be low, owing to the presence
of an unpaired electron in the HOMO level; hence, they are magnetic
with the spin moment of 1 μB. Here, we also verified
the type of magnetism by calculating the energies of the clusters
in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations. The results show that
the clusters with an odd n value prefer to be in
ferromagnetic (FM) configuration rather than respective AFM configuration
(refer Figure S9, the Supporting Information). On the other hand, all the clusters having even numbered Li atoms
are nonmagnetic and they possess larger gap as compared to nearby
odd numbered clusters. Thus, it can be seen in Figure 2a that the HOMO–LUMO gap of the cluster oscillates
with respect to n value. It is also observed that
Si4Li4, Ge4Li4, and Sn4Li4 clusters have the large HOMO–LUMO gap
and high structural stability in their respective cluster family,
as they are stable Zintl clusters.34,35

Figure 2 (a) BE and
(b) HOMO–LUMO gap of various M4Lin clusters (M = Si, Ge and Sn), n varies from
0 to 10.

Figure 2b illustrates
the variation of BE of M4Lin clusters with respect to n. The BE of these clusters
varies in the order Si4Lin >
Ge4Lin > Sn4Lin. This suggests that structurally, the lithiated
Si clusters (including pristine) are more stable as compared to Ge/Sn
clusters. However, the observed trend shows that in each series BE
is reduced when the pristine M4 cluster is lithiated. It
is worthy to mention that even though BE reduces gradually as the
lithiation proceed, at n = 4, we could observe a
rise in BE value as shown in Figure 2b, which confirms the high structural stability of
the M4Li4 cluster as compared to any other lithiated
cluster we studied. These calculations show that for all M4Lin clusters, the HOMO–LUMO gap
and BE are well correlated. Yet, in few cases, the atomic structures
of both Si4Lin and Ge4Lin clusters are slightly different from
that of Sn4Lin clusters owing
to their large BE as compared to Sn4Lin clusters.

Next, to understand the interaction between
these clusters and
CNT, we preferred various stable clusters for depositing them into
CNTs. Here, different sized arm chair [m,m] CNTs with m = 7–10 are taken
for our calculations. The arm chair CNT is chosen as it is superior
to both zigzag and chiral CNTs in terms of mechanical stability and
electronic conductivity. The clusters are inserted into the CNT, so
that the system will mimic the M–Li–CNT nanocomposite
as observed in various experiments.23,24 The optimum
size of the CNT for inserting these clusters into CNT is decided by
calculating the adsorption energy (Ead), from. 2  where E(M4Lin), E(CNT), and E(M4Lin + CNT) correspond to
total energies of M4Lin cluster,
CNT, and cluster inserted CNT, respectively. Note that, for obtaining
the stable configuration of cluster inside CNT, we attempted several
models in which the clusters are oriented inside the CNT in various
fashion as given in Figures S10–S20 (refer the Supporting Information). Among them, the lowest
energy configuration is considered for further studies. The calculated Ead values are also tabulated in Table 1. From the obtained Ead values, we understood that the [8,8] CNT
is most preferred for inserting the Si4Lin/Ge4Lin clusters with n = 0–8. However, for inserting Si4Li10 or Ge4Li10 clusters, a [9,9] CNT is
found to be optimum. The size of Sn4Lin clusters are comparatively larger than that of both Si4Lin and Ge4Lin. Thus, for inserting Sn4Lin clusters, [8,8] CNT is preferred only up to n = 6, beyond this, the [9,9] CNT shows maximum Ead. Meanwhile the calculated Ead values indicate that the interaction between all three
bare M4 clusters and CNT is weak; the corresponding Ead values are 0.15, 0.12, and 0.03 eV for M
= Si, Ge, and Sn, respectively. In fact Figure 3 implies that the adsorption becomes gradually
stronger once the pristine M4 clusters are lithiated. Moreover,
it is also revealed that beyond n = 4, the Ead values are remarkably enhanced, suggesting
that the clusters are firmly adsorbed in the inner side of the CNT
after the formation of stable Zintl cluster. Because these clusters
are strongly adsorbed, beyond n = 4, it is obvious
that their geometry is affected. From the relaxed structures of the
composite, we identified that the lithium dimer in clusters is becoming
weaker when they are inserted into the CNT. For instance, the Li4 tetrahedron in the Si4Li6 cluster has
deformed and the respective Li atoms started to interact with the
C6 ring of the CNT when this cluster is inserted into the
CNT (refer Figure S14, the Supporting Information). Moreover, we counted the number of Li–Li bonds (NLi–Li) present in the clusters before
and after inserting into the CNT, and the values are provided in Table 1, which infers that
clusters possess lesser number of Li–Li bonds when they are
inside CNT. Hence, it is revealed that the C–Li bond is more
preferred over the Li–Li bond, when the clusters are embedded
inside the CNT. In a similar fashion, the geometry of the Si4Li8 cluster is significantly modified when it is adsorbed
inside the CNT as shown in Figure S15 (refer the Supporting Information). Here, the Si4 unit of
the Si4Li8 cluster adopts a square like structure
by forming one extra Si–Si bond. Likewise, Ge4Li6 and Ge4Li8 clusters also undergo similar
structural changes when they are encapsulated in CNTs. Thus, on the
basis of the adsorption study of the cluster, we concluded that the
lithiated clusters are strongly adsorbed inside the CNT when compared
with that of pristine M4 clusters. Besides this, the reduction
in the number of Li–Li bonds within the clusters when they
are inside CNT indicates that such a cluster/CNT composite may suppress
the growth of Li dendrite in anode during the charging process; hence,
the electrochemical performance of these nanocomposites will be better.36 In addition, we also calculated the Ead using the DFT-D2 method. Here, we found that
the dispersion effect leads to significant enhancement in the Ead and it is more pronounced for Sn4Lin clusters, which is evidenced from
the comparatively larger Ead than that
of Si4Lin and Ge4Lin clusters when they composite with
the CNT (refer Figure S21, the Supporting Information). However, here also we confirmed that the clusters are firmly adsorbed
only after the formation of stable M4Li4 clusters.

a For pristine clusters, distances
are given in parenthesis. The number of Li–Li bonds (NLi–Li) before and (after) inserting into
CNT is also provided. The charge transfer is calculated from the Bader
charge analysis and is provided. Size of CNT is also given in square
parenthesis.

Apart from
inserting clusters into the CNT, we also carried out
calculations for various cases, in which the clusters are deposited
on the outer wall of the CNT and the Ead for these configurations is compared with that of cluster inserted
in the inner side of CNT cases. Interestingly, here, we noticed that
in most of the cases the clusters are strongly interacting with CNT
when they are present inside the CNT owing to the formation of more
number of C–Li bonds. The converged structures and corresponding Ead for various Si4Lin cluster anchored on CNT’s wall are provided
in Figure S22 (refer the Supporting Information).

In all these cases, we have exclusively studied the interaction
between clusters with CNT when they are incorporated inside the CNT.
Hence, it is important to assess the amount of reduction in energy
during the insertion of the cluster into the CNT. Toward this direction,
we selected the M4Li6 cluster as the representative
one for inserting into a piece of a nonperiodic [8,8] CNT having the
length of ≈10.45 Å. Note that the edges of the CNT are
terminated with hydrogen atoms owing to the charge compensation. Further
to determine energetics of cluster insertion, we modeled various configurations
in such a way that the cluster which is initially kept a distance
of 4.5 Å from the CNT’s edge is gradually moved (0.5 Å
in each step) until it reaches the inner side of the nanotube. In
this way, the total energies are calculated for various configurations.
Our results suggest that the energy of the composite is reduced, when
the cluster approaches near to the edges and then suddenly drops to
a minimum value when it enters inside the CNT. It is also revealed
that during structural relaxation, the cluster will move itself into
the CNT, if it is placed at the close proximity of CNT’s edges
(<2 Å). This infers that the cluster prefers to be in the
inner side of the CNT rather than the other portions. However, as
compared to Si4Li6 and Ge4Li6 clusters, the Sn4Li6 moves slightly
lesser and it remains partially near to the edges as shown in Figure
S23 (refer the Supporting Information).
To quantify the decrease in energy during the insertion of the cluster,
we calculated the relative energy (ΔE) for
various cases with respect to the most stable configuration and the
same is plotted against the distance (X) of the cluster
from the CNT as shown in Figure 4. From these calculations, we realized that during
the insertion of the cluster, the composite becomes more stable by
an amount of ≈3.85, 3.77, and 3.51 eV for Si4Li6, Ge4Li6, and Sn4Li6 cases, respectively. Note that this value may vary depending upon
the number of M and Li atoms presented in the cluster.

Figure 4 Energy variation during
the insertion of M4Li6 cluster into CNT. The
green colored dashed line represents one of
the edge sides of CNT. The gray, purple, green, and cyan balls represent
C, Si, Li, and H atoms, respectively.

Furthermore, to understand the aforesaid interaction between
the
cluster and CNT, we have studied the charge transfer between them.
For this, the charge transfer (Δρ) is computed as 3  where ρ(M4Lin/CNT), ρ(CNT), and ρ(M4Lin) are the total charge densities
of the composite,
CNT, and M4Lin cluster, respectively.
The schematic of charge-transfer diagram is bestowed in Figure 5, which clearly demonstrates
that for Si4/[8,8] CNT case, there is no charge transfer
between the cluster and CNT. However, a minute charge polarization
occurred on both CNT and Si4 cluster. Similar charge polarization
is also observed in the case of Ge4/[8,8] CNT and
Sn4/[8,8]CNT composite (not shown here). On the contrary,
for lithiated cluster-inserted cases, the charge transfer is significant
and a disc-like isosurface appeared near to the wall of CNT. This
implies that charge transfer occurs from the cluster to CNT via Li
atoms. This interaction is commonly known as cation−π
interaction, which is generally observed when a cation approaches
near to any delocalized π electron systems.37,38

Top and side views of charge-transfer diagrams for Si4/[8,8]
CNT, (c,d) correspond to Si4Li6/[8,8] CNT composite,
respectively. Cyan and yellow colored isosurfaces
denote excess and depletion of charge densities, respectively.

Further, to estimate the charge
transfer, we performed Bader charge
calculations,39,40 and the charge transfer (δQB) from the cluster to CNT is calculated by
taking the difference of the Bader charge of the clusters before and
after inserting into the CNT. The calculated δQB values are tabulated in Table 1. It infers that an accountable increment
in δQB occurs after the formation
of highly stable M4Li4 Zintl cluster, and further,
the values remain almost steady (in the range of 2.26–2.41,
2.23–2.43, and 2.32–2.62e– for M = Si, Ge, and Sn, respectively when n >
4,
refer Table 1). This
charge-transfer analysis elucidates that for lithiated cluster-loaded
CNT system, the excess charge from the cluster to CNTs wall occurs
through cation−π interaction which help to adhere the
cluster on the CNT’s wall, and thus stabilizes these composites.

Thereon, to inspect the electronic properties of these composites,
we deduced electronic DOS. The DOS of Si4Lin/CNT composite is shown in Figure 6. As discussed earlier, even though the interaction
between pristine Si4 with CNT wall is weak, we could observe
a narrow shift in total DOS of the composite toward the Fermi energy
(Ef) as compared to pristine [8,8] CNT.
In addition, the localized Si 3p states are presented near to Ef. However, for lithiated clusters, the total
DOS is shifted away from the Ef to the
valance band region and this increases with respect to the increase
in the n value. However, with increasing lithiation,
from n = 2–4, we could not find much accountable
shift in total DOS. The reason is that as the Si4Li4 cluster is highly stable, the charge transfer from cluster
to CNT in those cases is found to be less. Perceptible deviation in
DOS away from the Ef is recognized for n > 4, and at n = 10, it is found to
be
0.76 eV. The DOS of Ge4Lin/CNT
as well as Sn4Lin/CNT composite
also shows similar features (refer Figures S24 and S26, the Supporting Information).

CNT. The shaded cyan region corresponds to total DOS of the composite
and black colored states represent the DOS pristine CNT. The value
and direction (arrow) of shift in the energy level of composite with
respect to bare CNT are given in each case.

Beside DOS, the band structure (BS) of the aforesaid systems
is
plotted for reaffirming the role of charge transfer on their electronic
structure and the same is shown in Figure 7. From BS of Si4/[8,8] CNT composite,
it is well clear that the insertion of Si4 cluster does
not affect the CNT’s bands significantly owing to the weak
interaction existing between them. Also, one discrete band arising
from the Si4 cluster is presented near to the Ef. The BS of Ge4/[8,8] CNT composite shows
similar features (shown in Figure S25, the Supporting Information), while in the case of Sn4/[8,8]CNT,
the energy band of cluster is lying above the Ef level (∼0.24 eV) (refer Figure S27, the Supporting Information). However, for Si4Li2/[8,8] CNT and Si4Li4/[8,8]
CNT cases, the BSs show that the discrete bands arising from the Si
atoms are occupied as the result of Li to Si charge transfer. In addition,
we noted that the linearly dispersed band (cone-like) arising from
the CNT is slightly occupied (refer Figure 7c,d). In contrast, for the remaining cases
such as Si4Li6/[8,8], Ge4Li6/[8,8], and Sn4Li6/[8,8], the aforesaid CNT
band is completely occupied as the charge transfer from cluster to
CNT is significantly higher in these cases. Beyond n = 6, we could not observe significant shift in CNT bands. Therefore,
more bands from cluster appeared in the valence band region for n > 6 cases. From the electronic structure calculations,
we concluded that for stabilizing M4Lin/CNT composite the charge transfer plays a vital role. Moreover,
CNTs easily accept two electrons from the lithiated cluster. This
result is in agreement with the Bader charge analysis.

Finally, to unveil the
electrochemical properties of these composites,
the AIV41 is calculated from 4  where E(Lix1@M4Lin), E(Lix2@M4Lin), E(Li), and F denote total
energies of x1 and x2 Li ions intercalated
in M4Lin cluster inserted into
CNT, chemical potential of Li–metal, and the Faraday constant,
respectively. For intercalating Li atoms, a hexagonally stacked assembly
of cluster-inserted CNT composite is modeled, and the Li atoms are
allowed to intercalate in the voids which are formed between the adjacent
CNTs as shown in Figure S28 (refer the Supporting Information). It is important to mention that in the assembly
of CNTs, the interaction between the adjacent nanotubes is weak van
der Waals (vdW) force. Hence, we have included the dispersion correction
throughout these calculations as mentioned in the computational methodology.
Therefore, all the energies used for calculating AIV included vdW
correction. The AIV profile for all M4Lin/CNT composites is shown in Figure 8. From the obtained AIV profile of the Si4Lin/CNT composite, it clears that
the Si4/[8,8] CNT assembly has the maximum AIV (≈1.00
V), and this value is slowly reduced for lithiated cluster-inserted
composites (refer Figure 8). Here, for Si4Li8/[8,8] CNT assembly,
the calculated mean AIV is 0.43 V. However, for Ge4Lin/CNT composite the highest AIV is observed
in the case of Ge4/[8,8] CNT system (≈1.05 V). Alike
the Si/CNT composite, here also the potential is reduced for lithiated
cluster-incorporated CNT composites as shown in the AIV profile. For
instance, in the case of Ge4Li8/[8,8] assembly,
the mean AIV is found to be 0.49 V, which is slightly higher than
that of Si4Li8/[8,8] CNT assembly’s AIV.
It is important to mention that the calculated AIV values for both
composites are lesser than that of the Sn4/CNT (≈1.11
V) composite. For the Sn4Lin/CNT composite, the AIV is lowered from 1.11 V to 0.55 V as we move
from Sn4 to Sn4Li8 clusters. Moreover,
we compared these voltage with that of pristine CNT; for which the
AIV has been found to be approximately 0.90 V. From this, we confirmed
that the insertion of lithiated M4 cluster into CNT significantly
reduces the intercalation voltage of the composite. A lower value
of AIV for the composite indicates that the intercalated Li atoms
can easily shuttle between anode and cathode during cell cycling.
Therefore, M4Lin/CNT composite
can be used as a potential candidate for the anode of LIBs.

Conclusions
To summarize, we have
investigated the structural, electronic,
and Li intercalation properties of the composite consisting of Si4Lin/Ge4Lin cluster-inserted CNTs for the anode of LIB applications.
Initially, we compared the structural and electronic properties of
various Si4Lin/Ge4Lin with Sn4Lin clusters. We proved from the BE values that the
Si4Lin clusters possess high
structural stability and they are less vulnerable toward lithiation.
Moreover, the large HOMO–LUMO gap of the M4Lin clusters having even number of Li atoms
depicts their higher electronic stability over those with odd number
of Li atoms. Further, these stable clusters are selected for studying
the interaction with CNT. From this, we understood the lithiated clusters
exhibit strong interaction with the wall of CNT as the result of charge
transfer from cluster to CNT via cation−π interaction
and it plays crucial role for stabilizing the nanocomposites. Moreover,
the Li–Li clustering is found to be undermined when the lithiated
clusters are present inside CNT; which is expected to be beneficial
the electrode performance. Indeed, our calculations on the M4Li6 cluster and hydrogen-terminated CNT demonstrate that
the encapsulation of lithiated cluster into the CNT is energetically
highly favored. The deduced electronic structures of the composite
also suggest that the insertion of lithiated cluster into CNT enhances
the stability of the composite. Eventually, the Li intercalation properties
of the composite are determined by calculating AIV, which infers that
the CNT composites of Si4Lin and Ge4Lin have potential
which is comparable to that of a CNT. Moreover, the presence of a
lithiated cluster inside the CNT leads to the significant reduction
in the AIV of the composite, thus allowing easy shuttling of intercalated
Li ions during charge–discharge process. Hence our study proves
that these nanocomposites can be used as a potential candidate for
the anode of LIBs.

Computational Methodology
In this
work, first-principles density functional calculations
were performed using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)42 to understand the structural and electronic
properties of Si–Li and Ge–Li clusters with single-walled
CNTs. To understand the structural changes from 2D to 3D geometry,
at least four atoms containing cluster is essential; hence, we considered
four atoms containing atomic clusters of Si and Ge throughout this
work. The projector augmented wave43 pseudopotential
method was used to describe the atoms, and electron–electron
interactions were correlated by generalized gradient approximations.44 All the atomic clusters were optimized by keeping
them in sufficiently large (a = 15 Å) cubic
unit cell. Similarly, large a and b (= 21 Å) lattice constants were chosen for isolated and cluster-inserted
CNTs. Note that for modeling CNTs, 1 × 1 × 5 supercells
were constructed. A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV was used for
all the structural relaxation calculations. To study the closed pack
assembly of CNTs, the unit cell is completely relaxed without considering
any symmetry. To account the weak vdW interaction between the adjacent
CNTs in the hexagonal assembly, we performed dispersion-corrected
DFT-D2 calculations for the respective cases.45 For sampling the Brillouin zone, Monkhorst–Pack 1 ×
1 × 1, 1 × 1 × 4, and 2 × 2 × 4 k-meshes were used for optimizing the clusters, cluster-inserted CNT,
and its assembly, respectively. Dense k-mesh of 1
× 1 × 50 was chosen for deducing electronic DOS and BSs
for all the cases. Throughout the geometry optimizations, all the
ions were relaxed self-consistently without considering any symmetry
and the iterative relaxation processes were repeated until absolute
force on each ion was converged to the order of 0.01 eV/Å. The
convergence for energy was also set to be 10–6 eV
in our calculations. We repeated all calculations with aforesaid criteria
to find the magnetic solution of the system and this solution is favored
for cluster with odd number of Li atoms.
