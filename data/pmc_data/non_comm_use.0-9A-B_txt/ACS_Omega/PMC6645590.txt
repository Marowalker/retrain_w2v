Here, we provide a deeper insight
into the state of sulfur confined
in ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) and clarify its electrochemical reaction
mechanism with lithium by corroborating the results obtained using
various experimental techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
electron energy loss spectroscopy, in situ Raman
spectroscopy, and in situ electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy. In combination, these results indicate that sulfur in
UMC exists as linear polymeric sulfur rather than smaller allotropes.
The electrochemical reactivity of lithium with sulfur confined in
UMC (pore size ≤0.7 nm) is different from that of sulfur confined
in microporous carbon (≤2 nm, or ultramicroporous carbon containing
significant amount of micropores) and mesoporous carbon (>2 nm).
The
observed quasi-solid-state reaction of lithium with sulfur in UMC
with a single voltage plateau during the discharge/charge process
is due to the effective separation of solvent molecules from the active
material. The size of carbon pores plays a vital role in determining
the reaction path of lithium with sulfur confined in UMC.

Introduction
Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries
have been the most
researched electrochemical energy-storage system recently. Sulfur
is an attractive positive electrode material for lithium batteries,
mainly due to its high specific capacity (1675 mAh g–1), high specific energy (2600 Wh kg–1), and low
cost.1−3 On the downside, sulfur and its discharge product
(Li2S) are electrical insulators,4,5 and
the lithiation of sulfur results in a large volume change (80%).6 The reaction of lithium with sulfur in nonaqueous
electrolytes (ether-based) results in the formation of lithium polysulfides
(LixS8), which are soluble
in electrolyte.7 The dissolved polysulfides
diffuse to the anode and get reduced at the anode. The solubility
of polysulfide gradually reduces the amount of sulfur in the cathode,
thereby limiting the cycle life of Li–S batteries.8,9 Several strategies have been proposed to overcome these issues related
to Li–S batteries, such as (i) by combining sulfur with various
conducting matrices like carbon nanotubes (CNTs),10,11 graphene,12 porous carbons,2,13−16 conductive polymers,17 and metal oxides;18−20 (ii) by modifying the electrolyte compositions21 or by opting to ionic liquid electrolytes,22,23 polymer electrolytes, or solid-state electrolytes;24,25 and (iii) by modifying the cell configuration.26,27

Ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) exhibits unique advantages for
the
development of sustainable Li–S batteries and other applications.16,28,29 Since first reports, it has been
speculated that UMC confines smaller allotropes of sulfur, thereby
eliminating the formation of higher-order lithium polysulfides. Due
to space constraints in UMC, the direct contact between sulfur and
organic liquid electrolyte solvents is prevented, thereby eliminating
the dissolution of active species. This allows the use of carbonate-based
solvents in Li–S batteries, which are otherwise considered
unsuitable. Despite these advantages, little is known about the state
of sulfur confined in UMC and its reactivity toward lithium. Few reports
investigated Li reactivity toward sulfur confined in UMC.7,16,30−32 In our earlier
report, we have attempted to investigate the state of sulfur in UMC
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques.16 From XPS analysis, direct transformation of
sulfur to lower-order polysulfide Li2S2/Li2S was concluded.16 However, XPS
technique is limited to the surface or subsurface region. Hence, the
state of sulfur confined in UMC and its reactivity toward Li are still
unclear. Combining the results obtained using various experimental
techniques, such as XPS, EELS, in situ Raman spectroscopy,
and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), we here aim at a detailed understanding of the state of sulfur
in UMC and its reaction mechanism with Li in carbonate-based electrolytes.

Results
and Discussion
Structure and Morphology of UMC and UMC–S
Composite
The UMC–S composite was prepared by the
melt-infusion method
under vacuum. The synthesis of the UMC host was detailed in our earlier
report.16 UMC and sulfur were mixed at
a 1:1 weight ratio, heated at 155 ± 1 °C for 12 h, and cooled
to room temperature (RT) under vacuum in a glass oven. Figure 1 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm and pore-size distribution (inset) of the UMC host. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of UMC exhibit type
I isotherm. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area and pore volume are 1600 m2 g–1 and
0.66 cm3 g–1, respectively. The density
functional theory (DFT) pore-size distribution curve shows exclusively
micropores, most of them with a diameter of 0.53 nm. Figure 2a shows XPS spectra recorded
in the S 2p region on a UMC–S composite before sputtering and
after 3 and 10 min sputtering. After sputtering, the S–O peak
on the surface disappeared and a small peak at a lower binding energy
(BE) (162.1 eV) appeared, which was attributed to the C–S interaction.16Figure 2b presents the Raman spectra of sulfur, UMC, and UMC–S
composite. The Raman spectrum of elemental sulfur has three prominent
peaks at 153, 218, and 473 cm–1, which correspond
to crystalline sulfur.33 Raman spectra
of UMC and UMC–S composite exhibited only two peaks at around
1330 and 1590 cm–1, which are the characteristic
D-band and G-band of carbonaceous materials,34 respectively. No peaks were detected below 500 cm–1 in the case of UMC–S composite due to the lack of sulfur
on the surface and to the absorption of any wavelength by the black
host material.

the UMC host material and elemental sulfur. (c) TEM images and (d–f)
power-law background-subtracted EELS spectra of UMC and UMC–S
composite.

The TEM images of UMC and UMC–S
composite (Figure 2c) reveal a disordered structure
in either case. The energy-filtered TEM analysis of the UMC–S
composite showed no sulfur segregates on the surface. Furthermore,
EELS measurements were performed to get more insight into the structural
and electronic properties of the UMC–S composite. Power-law
background-subtracted EELS spectra of the samples are shown in Figure 2d (UMC) and Figure 2e,f (UMC–S
composite). The carbon K-edge spectra of UMC and UMC–S (Figure 2d,e) exhibit two
main features: (i) a sharp peak at 285 eV corresponding to the 1s
→ π* and (ii) a broad feature at >292 eV, corresponding
to the 1s → σ* transitions. The π* and σ*
peaks at the C-K edge of the UMC–S composite (Figure 2e) are significantly sharpened
compared to UMC (Figure 2d). The increased sharpness of the π* peak reflects an increase
in sp2 hybridization (graphitization) after sulfur incorporation,
and the σ* peak increment indicates an additional contribution
due to C–S interactions, which supports the results from XPS.
The peaks at 165.7 and 228.7 eV corresponding to the S L2,3 edge and S L1 edge confirm the presence of sulfur in
the UMC–S composite (Figure 2f).

State of Sulfur in UMC–S
Figure 3 shows the
proposed synthesis scheme for
the infusion of sulfur into the UMC host material. During heating,
sulfur undergoes various changes. Initially, the room-temperature-stable
orthorhombic S8 converts to monoclinic sulfur (β-S)
at 95.5 °C. On further heating to 119 °C, monoclinic sulfur
melts, and at above 150 °C, cyclo-S8 undergoes thermal
scission and simultaneously radical polymerization, producing linear,
polymeric sulfur chains.35 Since the glass
oven temperature was maintained at 155 °C under reduced pressure,
we hypothesize that linear sulfur chains are infused into ultramicropores,
driven by capillary forces. The infused linear polymeric sulfur chains
tend to align the carbon lattice (graphitization) along the length
of the carbon pore. In fact, this conclusion is supported by EELS.
EELS spectra of the UMC–S composite recorded at the C-K edge
exhibited an increase in π* peak intensity, indicating ordering
(graphitization) after sulfur incorporation. Due to size constraints,
the infused linear polymeric sulfur maintains its linear form inside
UMC even at RT. The operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements
of UMC–S electrodes showed the formation of higher-order polysulfide
(Li2Sx) at the very start of
discharge.37 This also indicates that sulfur
exists as a linear polymeric chain in UMC and not as smaller allotropes.
Sulfur is known to exist as linear chains inside single-walled carbon
nanotubes with an inner diameter of 1.1 nm and double-walled carbon
nanotubes with an inner diameter of 0.6 nm.37 It is interesting to note that, although sulfur was infused at 600
°C under vacuum (<1 Pa) into the CNTs, it preferred to exist
in linear form at room temperature37 (sulfur
exists as short chains at 600 °C35). From the data of the different methods, we conclude that sulfur,
in fact, exists as a linear polymeric chain inside UMC, which has
pores predominantly with a diameter of 0.5 nm.

Electrochemical Performance
of UMC–S in Carbonate and
Ether Electrolytes
Figure 4a shows the discharge/charge voltage profiles of the
UMC–S composite cathode with carbonate electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1
v/v)) cycled at C/20. The first discharge curve consists of two plateaus.
The short plateau at 2.38 V (vs Li+/Li) is due to the reaction
of lithium with the surface functional groups of the carbon host in
the composite electrode (it disappeared after the first cycle). Figure 4b shows the first
discharge voltage profile for the as-synthesized carbon host (UMC)
with no sulfur infiltrated. A similar plateau at 2.38 V (vs Li+/Li) is observed in the UMC host due to the reaction of Li
with surface functional groups of carbon, which confirms that the
plateau observed at 2.38 V corresponds to the reaction of lithium
with the carbon host, as it is very similar in the first 100 mAh g–1 discharge capacity. The second discharge plateau
at 1.8 V corresponds to the reaction of sulfur in UMC host with Li.
Further cycling of the UMC–S composite cathode resulted in
a single discharge and charge plateau at 1.8 and 2.2 V (vs Li+/Li), respectively. A more detailed discussion of the electrochemical
characterization results of the UMC–S composite with a carbonate
electrolyte was given in our previous report.16

Figure 4 (a)
Discharge/charge voltage profiles of UMC–S composite
with carbonate electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1:1
v/v)) in the voltage range of 3.5–1 V at C/20. (b) Lithium
insertion into the as-synthesized UMC host (first discharge).

The UMC–S cathode with
carbonate electrolyte exhibited a
large irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the first cycle (Figure 4a), which could be
due to the reaction of polysulfides expelled to the surface. During
the discharge process, sulfur is converted to polysulfides, which
results in volume changes. Due to this, a fraction of polysulfide
might have been expelled to the surface, which reacts irreversibly
with carbonate molecules and reduces the amount of sulfur available
for the second cycle. Therefore, a possible way to reduce the ICL
in the first cycle would be to decrease the content of sulfur in the
UMC to counter the volume change. The reduced amount of sulfur in
the composite would reduce the areal capacity, which could be recovered,
however, by increasing the thickness of the electrode.

Figure 5 shows the
discharge voltage profiles of the UMC–S composite cathode in
an ether-based electrolyte (free of LiNO3 additive). It
should be emphasized that the reaction mechanism of the UMC–S
electrode with lithium in ether-based electrolytes is slightly different.
The linear ether molecules have better access to the sulfur in UMC
compared to the cyclic carbonate molecules. Hence, the sulfur accessible
to solvent molecules38 will react similar
to the sulfur confined in the mesoporous carbon.1 Sulfur that is not reachable to solvent molecules will
follow the quasi-solid-state reaction. In the first few cycles, the
UMC–S composite features three voltage plateaus during discharge
with ether-based electrolyte, in accordance with an earlier report.39 The first two plateaus are due to the reduction
of sulfur to higher-order polysulfides (Li2Sx, x = 8–4) at 2.4–2.3
V and further to lower-order polysulfides (Li2S2/Li2S) at 2.0–2.1 V. The third plateau at lower
potential is assigned to the reduction of sulfur confined in ultramicropores,
suggesting a solid-to-solid phase transition. From the sixth cycle,
the discharge pattern constitutes only a quasi-solid-state behavior,
as observed in the case of carbonate-based electrolyte. During the
initial five cycles, the polysulfide might have dissolved in ether
molecules and reacted at the anode similar to that of sulfur confined
in mesoporous carbon.38,1

of UMC–S composite

(1.0 M LiTFSI in dioxolane (DOL)/dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 v/v))
and (b) cycling behavior of the corresponding cell at C/20.

A single voltage plateau is attained
in discharge and charge profiles
(Figures 4a and 5a), although the cells were operated between 3.5
and 1 V (after five cycles in ether-based electrolytes), which is
above the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation potential and
irrespective of the electrolytes used. This underlines the importance
of the carbon structure. Thus, without the necessity for a stable
SEI, the size constraints in the UMC host reduced the contact between
sulfur and solvent, thereby leading to quasi-solid-state behavior.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Analysis
Figure 6 compares the XPS
spectra in the C 1s and O 1s region recorded on a UMC–S as-prepared
electrode and after the first discharge. The C 1s XPS spectra of the
as-prepared electrode exhibited three peaks at binding energies (BEs)
of 287.0, 289.0, and 291.0 eV corresponding to C–O, C=O,
and C–F bonds. During discharge, the peak at 289.0 eV, corresponding
to C=O species, lost intensity considerably and almost disappeared
due to the reaction with lithium. Consequently, the peak at 287.0
eV, corresponding to C–O, gained intensity after discharge.
The peak at 291.0 eV, which corresponds to C–F bonds, is due
to the binder poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF). Considering the
various plausible SEI components, an increase of the intensity of
the peaks related to both C=O and C–O would be expected
upon the growth of an SEI layer.40 Instead,
a decrease in C=O intensity is observed upon discharge from
3.5 to 1 V, which can be attributed to the reduction of the corresponding
functional groups at the surface of the carbon host by lithium.41 Therefore, SEI formation was not initiated at
this point. This is in line with previous reports that, in the absence
of additives in the carbonate-based or ether-based electrolyte, SEI
formation is expected to occur only below 0.9 V (vs Li+/Li).40

and O 1s region for the as-prepared
UMC–S electrode and after discharge to 1.0 V.

In Situ Raman Spectrum Analysis
To
probe the role of carbon (UMC) in transporting lithium to sulfur (as
sulfur infused in UMC is isolated from the electrolyte molecules), in situ Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on
a UMC–S cathode at C/20. Here, we used 1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1:1 v/v) as electrolyte and an ECC-Opto-Std (EL-CELL
GmbH) electrochemical cell. The voltage range was 1–3.5 V (vs
Li+/Li). Figure 7 shows the first discharge profile, and the inset shows the
evolution of the D and G bands corresponding to the host UMC during
discharge. The lithiation of the carbon–sulfur composite was
expected to affect the Raman D-band (disordered or defective structures)
and G-band (graphitic structures) of the carbon host.42 During discharge, there was no weakening or broadening
of the D-band. However, the position of the G-band was shifted to
slightly lower wavenumbers during the initial discharge and remained
unchanged until full discharge. Initially, carbon experienced a charge
transfer, resulting in the reduction of the surface functional groups,
which led to a red shift of the G-band.43−47 From the in situ Raman spectroscopy
measurements, we conclude that there is no insertion of Li into the
carbon (UMC) host in the potential range of 1–3.5 V vs Li+/Li and that the role of UMC is similar to that of a carbon-coated
cathode material for Li-ion batteries.48

profile of UMC–S composite cathode vs Li at C/20
rate. The inset shows the in situ Raman spectra recorded
during the discharge process.

In Situ Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
(EIS)
To get further insight into the reactivity of UMC–S
with lithium, in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements were performed on a UMC–S/Li cell during
the first cycle. Impedance spectra were recorded at various points
of discharge and charge, as depicted in Figure 8a (EIS1–EIS7). Initially, impedance
spectra were recorded at the open-circuit voltage potential (EIS1).
Subsequently, the electrode was galvanostatically discharged for 5
h at a C/20 rate, followed by 1 h of equilibration. Then, the next
impedance spectrum was recorded (EIS2). All other impedance spectra
were recorded similarly in the frequency range of 200 kHz to 1 mHz,
with a voltage amplitude of 5 mV. During post-processing (not shown
here), it turned out that the as-recorded impedance spectra suffered
from significant noise at frequencies below 0.1 Hz. Thus, the recorded
spectra were cut at this frequency. From the Nyquist plot of the preprocessed
data (Figure 8b), it
is evident that the cell impedance was highest at EIS1. We attribute
this high initial impedance to interfacial resistance. After discharging
the sample for 5 h, the interfacial resistance was considerably reduced.
The significant reduction of the interfacial resistance points toward
less resistive products at the surface. Further discharging of the
cell gradually reduced the impedance to a minimum at point EIS5, followed
by an increase during subsequent charging (EIS7). The gradual decrease
and increase of the impedance during the discharge and charge processes,
respectively, indicate that the discharge products are less resistive
than the charge products.

Figure 8 (a) Voltage profile of the cell discharged and
charged to various
states (at C/20) indicated as EIS1–EIS7; (b) impedance plots
of the cell at various discharged and charged states (as denoted in
(a)); (c) equivalent circuit; and (d) the distribution of relaxation
time plot of the preprocessed impedance spectra.

We have also analyzed the distribution of relaxation times
for
the measured impedance spectra. This method is well known for the
identification of polarization losses in fuel cells49,50 and batteries51 and allows the deconvolution
of the losses hidden in the impedance spectrum. Each point in the
obtained distribution function represents the fraction of the polarization
at a certain characteristic frequency and thus equals the resistance
of a single resistor–capacitor circuit with the time constant
τk in the measurement model shown in Figure 8c. The distribution functions
of the preprocessed impedance spectra are shown in Figure 8d. Apparently, there are two
processes, P1 and P2 (represented by two peaks
in the distribution), which dominate the impedance response in the
measured frequency range. Interestingly, these two processes follow
different trends in the course of the first cycle: for P1, constant expansion and shift to lower frequencies of the associated
peak is observed, whereas both the shift and the dimension of the
peak belonging to P2 seem to be reversible with discharge
and charge of the UMC–S electrode. For insertion materials,
the frequency ranges observed for P1 and P2 (10
Hz to 1 kHz and 1–10 Hz, respectively) have already been identified
in the literature and are commonly ascribed to losses from contact
resistances (interparticle or at the particle–current collector
interface) and faradic resistances associated with the charge-transfer
reaction at the electrode–electrolyte interface, respectively.51 In this context, the observed reversible dependency
of P2 on the open-circuit potential fits perfectly to the
assignment mentioned above because the charge-transfer resistance
is well known to depend on the lithiation degree of the insertion
compound. The steady increase of the peak associated with process
P1 points toward a steady increase of the contact resistance,
which might be caused by volume changes of the sulfur compound during
the discharge and charge processes.

Overall Electrochemical
Reaction Mechanism of Lithium with UMC–S
Composite
In general, the reaction of lithium with a carbon–sulfur
composite cathode in a Li–S cell using different electrolytes
can follow two types of reaction mechanisms, namely, a solid–liquid–solid
reaction and/or a quasi-solid-state reaction. Electrochemically, these
are reflected by two different types of voltage profiles. This difference
in reaction mechanism is mainly due to the difference in the accessibility
of solvent to the active component sulfur. If the solvent molecules
are accessible to sulfur, then the reaction follows a solid–liquid–solid
reaction mechanism; if the solvent access to sulfur is restricted,
then the reaction follows a quasi-solid-state reaction mechanism.
The former mechanism has been identified in mesoporous carbon (<2
nm) or microporous carbon (>0.7 nm) sulfur composites. However,
the
quasi-solid-state reaction mechanism is followed even in microporous
carbon, provided it is pretreated by cycling at lower potentials to
form a stable SEI.32

Figure 9 illustrates the difference
in solvent accessibility by sulfur in carbon pores of varying size
(UMC, microporous and mesoporous carbon) in carbon–sulfur composites.(i) In the case of ultramicropores
(<0.7
nm in Figure 9a), solvated
ions tend to be desolvated at the surface when the size of the pore
is smaller than the size of the solvated ions.7 Thus, ultramicropores can mitigate or prevent the dissolution of
active material, as the solvent concentration is very low or nearly
zero inside the pore. This results in a quasi-solid-state reaction
mechanism, irrespective of the electrolyte used (carbonate- or ether-based).39,52,53

(ii) In the case of microporous (0.7 to
≤2 nm) carbon–sulfur composites, the solvated ions can
still have access to the active material (Figure 9b).

(iii) In the case of mesoporous carbon–sulfur
composites, the sulfur is even more accessible by the solvent molecules
(Figure 9c), leading
to the dissolution of active material and intermediate polysulfides.
This results in two discharge plateaus in the ether-based electrolyte,
while the cells were not cyclable in carbonate-based electrolytes.21

carbon pores of varying size: (a) ultramicropore, (b) micropore, and
(c) mesopores, and the related reactivity toward lithium in Li–S
batteries.

Origin of the Voltage Plateau
Several studies on sulfur
confined in UMC displayed a single plateau during the discharge/charge
process.14,16,39,52−54 This is different from the two-plateau
discharge and charge behavior of typical cyclo-S8.55,56 It was speculated that the smaller allotropes
(S2 to S4) enable the direct formation of lower-order
polysulfides, resulting in a single plateau in the discharge curve.
Nevertheless, no evidence was reported to support the existence of
smaller allotropes of sulfur in UMC. However, operando XAS on UMC–S
electrodes suggests the gradual conversion of higher-order polysulfide
(Li2Sx) to lower-order polysulfides
(Li2S2/Li2S) during the electrochemical
discharge.36 In fact, for the first time,
the higher-order and lower-order polysulfides were clearly differentiated.
The observation of higher-order polysulfides during the initial stage
of the discharge suggests that sulfur exists as linear polymeric sulfur
rather than as smaller allotropes in the UMC host. Lower-order polysulfides
are unlikely to combine and form higher-order polysulfides during
discharge. This leads to the question of why a single plateau rather
than two plateaus are found in the electrochemical discharge curve.
The solid-state conversion potential of S8 to Li2S is 2.24 V vs Li+/Li, considering the free energy change
for the formation of Li2S from S8.52 The conversion potential was calculated assuming
cyclic S8, and the potential may change depending on the
sulfur polymorph.  This suggests
that the solid-state conversion
of S8 to Li2S should result in a single plateau
below 2.24 V. Smaller allotropes are not required for a single plateau.
Indeed, the single plateau was also observed for solid-state Li–S
batteries. Hence, the electrochemical reaction of lithium with sulfur
infused in UMC could be considered as a solid-state conversion, where
the electrolyte molecules have no direct access to the sulfur—a
quasi-solid-state reaction. In the case of sulfur confined in mesoporous
carbon, where sulfur is accessible to the electrolyte molecules,38 the conversion of S8 to Li2S shows different thermodynamics (due to the dissolved sulfur or
polysulfide), similar to iodine redox process, where the redox potential
depends on the reaction medium.57,58

Conclusions
Among various sulfur hosts, UMC exhibits unique advantages toward
the development of sustainable Li–S batteries, particularly
in conventional carbonate-based electrolytes. The effective separation
of solvent molecules and sulfur or polysulfide confined in ultramicropore
reduces the side reactions between polysulfide and electrolyte. The
elimination of polysulfide in the electrolyte also reduces the side
reactions at the anode side. So far, it was postulated that sulfur
confined in ultramicropores is present in the form of smaller sulfur
allotropes, due to size constraints. However, our experimental results
suggest that sulfur in UMC exists as linear polymeric sulfur rather
than as smaller allotropes. We also showed that the electrochemical
reactivity of lithium with sulfur confined in UMC is different from
that of sulfur confined in microporous carbon, ultramicroporous carbon
containing a significant amount of micropores, or mesoporous carbon.
The size of the carbon pores plays a critical role in determining
the reaction path of lithium with sulfur confined in it.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis and Characterization of UMC and UMC–S Composite
Ultramicroporous carbon (UMC) was prepared by KOH activation of
the carbon derived from coconut shells. The coconut shell powder was
carbonized at 600 °C for 2 h under Ar gas flow. The carbon obtained
was mixed with KOH at a ratio of 1:4 (wt %) and activated under Ar
flow. Initially, the mixture was heated to 400 °C and maintained
at that temperature for 1 h, and then the temperature was raised to
800 °C and kept for 2 h. The activated carbon obtained was neutralized
using dil. HCl and washed with water and dried. N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer.
The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, and the pore-size distributions were calculated by the
density functional theory (DFT) method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were carried out with a PHI 5800 MultiTechnique
ESCA System using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) monochromatized radiation.
The measurements were done at a detection angle of 45°, using
pass energies of 93.9 and 29.35 eV for survey and detail spectra,
respectively. For binding energy calibration, the main C (1s) peak
was set to 284.8 eV. The sample surfaces were sputtered for 3 and
10 min (5 kV; 1 μA; sputter rate, ∼1 nm min–1) for subsurface analysis. Raman spectra were collected at RT using
a confocal Raman microscope (InVia, Renishaw) in the spectral range
100–2500 cm–1, using a He–Ne laser
with a wavelength of 632.8 nm as the excitation source. TEM and EELS
spectra were obtained using a Cs-corrected FEI Titan 80-300 microscope
equipped with a GIF Quantum 965 energy filter and operated at 80 kV
to avoid knock-on damage and to increase the energy resolution.

Electrochemical Measurements
The UMC–S composite
(45.8 wt % of S) and PVDF binder were mixed in a weight ratio of 90:10
using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone as a solvent. The
slurry obtained was coated on a stainless steel foil and dried at
90 °C overnight. The fabricated electrode contained around 2
mg cm–2 of sulfur loading. Li foil (Aldrich, 99.9%)
was used as the anode. A borosilicate glass fiber sheet was used as
the separator. Either 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 ethylene carbonate
(EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) mixture (LP30, BASF) or 1.0 M LiTFSI
in dioxolane (DOL)/dimethoxyethane (DME) (1:1 v/v) mixture was used
as the electrolyte. The cell assembly and electrode fabrication were
done in an Ar-filled glovebox. Electrochemical studies were performed
at RT using Swagelok type cells. The cells were cycled between 1.0
and 3.5 V vs Li+/Li at different current densities using
an Arbin battery cycling unit BT2000. For EIS measurements, an electrochemical
workstation (Bio-Logic) was used. The amplitude was set at 5 mV in
the frequency range of 200 kHz to 1 mHz.

In Situ Raman Studies
In situ Raman measurements
on UMC–S electrodes were performed using
an ECC-Opto-Std (EL-CELL GmbH) electrochemical cell. A thick slurry
containing UMC–S and PVDF in the ratio of 90:10 was deposited
onto an stainless steel current collector (16 mm) with a 1 mm hole
in the middle. The electrodes were dried in an oven at 90 °C
for 12 h. The in situ cell was assembled using the
UMC–S-coated current collectors as a positive electrode, lithium
foil as an anode, and a borosilicate glass fiber soaked with 1 M LiPF6 in 1:1 ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (LP30,
BASF) as separator and electrolyte. The assembled cell was connected
to an IM6 electrochemical system (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH) for galvanostatic
cycling. The in situ Raman cell was discharged and
charged between 1.0 and 3.5 V vs Li+/Li at a rate of C/20.
Raman spectra were collected at RT using a confocal Raman microscope
(InVia, Renishaw) in the spectral range of 1000–2500 cm–1 using a He–Ne laser with a wavelength of 632.8
nm. The laser power was set to ≈1.0 mW, and the spectrum acquisition
time was 20 s.
