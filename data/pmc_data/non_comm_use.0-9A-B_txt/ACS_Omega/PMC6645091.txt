Two neutral bis(pentafluorophenyl)thiolate gold(III) complexes
with the unsymmetrical S^N ligands 2-aminothiophenol or cysteamine
have been synthesized and their reactivity has been studied. Homo-
and heterodinuclear compounds were obtained by their coordination
to gold(I) or silver(I) derivatives through the sulfur atom. Interestingly,
a tetranuclear derivative bearing short gold(I)···gold(I)
and the more unusual gold(I)···gold(III) interactions
has been prepared. These amino-thiolate derivatives can be used as
precursors for the synthesis of novel gold(III) acyclic diaminocarbene
complexes by reaction with isocyanides CNR. The nucleophilic attack
of the amino group to isocyanide molecules affords the synthesis of
unprecedented bidentate C^S acyclic diaminocarbene ligands. All of
the complexes are air- and moisture-stable at room temperature and
have been spectroscopically and structurally characterized.

Introduction
The chemistry of gold
has undergone a big development in the last
decades mainly because of the great range of applications presented
by its complexes. However, this is really true for gold(I) derivatives.
The chemistry of gold(III) is an active area but has been less explored
than gold(I) chemistry probably because of the instability of gold(III)
species to reduction.1 Consequently, the
synthesis of gold(III) derivatives has been the subject of increasing
interest mainly because of its versatile applications as catalysts,2 as luminescent materials,3 or as antitumor or antiviral agents.4 Gold trichloride was one of the first gold catalyst used, and from
then on, several gold(III) complexes bearing bidentate ligands have
been reported as excellent catalysts in some organic transformations.5 In addition, excellent photophysical properties
have been found in tridentate cyclometallated gold(III) complexes
bearing ancillary ligands such as N-heterocyclic
carbenes, alkynyls, amides, or thiolates.6 Biological studies of gold(III) derivatives have been developed
in part because they are isostructural and isoelectronic to platinum(II)
complexes. It was supposedly a cytotoxic activity similar to that
of cisplatin, the most wide metal-based antitumor
drug. However, in physiological conditions, gold(III) can be reduced
to gold(I). For this reason, the election of suitable ligands to stabilize
the gold(III) complexes to prevent their reduction is important. For
example, metallacyclic gold(III) complexes7 or chelated gold(III) derivatives7 with
multidentate ligands have been stablished as far more stable under
physiological conditions than any other, and some of them have been
identified as good antitumor agents.7

Gold(III) thiolate derivatives are less represented than the related
gold(I) species probably because of the ability of thiolate groups
to reduce gold(III) to gold(I)8 although,
for example, some tetrathiolate gold(III) compounds with highly electron-deficient
thiols (highly fluorinated), that may be less capable of reducing
gold(III), were synthesized by Bachman et al.,9 and some others with pentafluorophenyl groups have been described.10 Moreover, an important number of metallacyclic
gold(III) complexes with thiolate ligands have been reported, and
some of them have been identified as good antitumor agents.11

In this work, we were aiming at preparing stable gold(III) derivatives
bearing bidentate S^N and S^C ligands. Mono- and binuclear thiolate
gold(III) derivatives with potential medicinal properties have been
prepared. Two heterofunctional ligands, 2-aminothiophenol and cysteamine,
have been used to synthesize the corresponding bis(pentafluorophenyl)(thiolate)gold(III)
derivatives. We have chosen both ligands because
of their different functional groups, the thiolate sulfur atom, that
provide stability to the compound in addition to provide further reactivity
by coordination of other metals, and the amino group that is a reactive
group can be further functionalized. Thus, the bis(pentafluorophenyl)(thiolate)gold(III)
complexes can act as metalloligands through the donor sulfur atom
to give homo- and hetero-bimetallic complexes. Moreover, the amine
nitrogen (NH2) of the ligands can react with isocyanide
groups to give the corresponding gold(III) derivatives with unprecedented
bidentate S^C acyclic diaminocarbenes. These ligands, similar to the
widely studied N-heterocyclic carbenes, are being the subject of a
great attention because of their excellent possibilities to modulate
both steric and electronic properties, as well as the easier mode
to obtain chiral derivatives compared to the N-heterocyclic
carbenes.12 The reactivity of gold–amine
complexes with isocyanide molecules or gold isocyanide compounds with
amines to give the corresponding acyclic diaminocarbene complexes
has been stablished for gold(I) and gold(III) derivatives.13 Most of
the acyclic diaminocarbenes described are mono (Figure 1a)13b,13c or dicarbene (Figure 1b)13d gold(III) species, but we have previously reported functionalized
cyclic diaminocarbenes, originating from the reaction of cyclometalled
complexes containing an amine group with isocyanides (Figure 1c).13g

Figure 1 Gold(III)
acyclic diaminocarbenes.

Following this strategy of using bidentate heterofunctional amine
ligands bonded to a gold(III) center, we have chosen aminothiolates
because they underwent a reaction with isocyanide ligands in the gold
coordination sphere, without reduction or decomposition, allowing
the synthesis of a novel bidentate-chelated C^S acyclic aminocarbene
ligands.

Results and Discussion
The gold(III) complexes have
been prepared starting from the cis-[Au(C6F5)2(OEt2)2]ClO4 precursor which has two labile
diethyl ether molecules. In this work, two functionalized amines,
2-aminothiophenol and cysteamine, were used to prepare the uncharged
starting materials 1 and 2, respectively,
(Scheme 1) as yellow
solids that are air- and moisture-stable solids. These derivatives,
as well as the following derivatives, have been characterized by means
of infrared (IR), elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.
Assignments of the 1H NMR and 13C NMR signals
were made on the basis of two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy
and heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectra.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Complexes 1 and 2
The IR spectra of 1 and 2 present, apart
from other absorptions, the vibrations because of the pentafluorophenyl
groups bonded to gold(III) at 1503 (s), 952 (s), 801 (s), and 792
(s) cm–1 for 1 or 1507 (s), 960 (s),
811 (m), and 797 (m) cm–1 for 2. 1H NMR spectra show the expected resonances for the ligands
with a different chemical shift. The 19F NMR spectrum of
each compound presents six resonances, two for the para fluorines consistent with two different C6F5 and two for both the ortho and the meta fluorines. This indicates that the pentafluorophenyl rings can rotate
around the gold–carbon bond at room temperature. In the ESI+ mass spectra, the fragments [M + H]+ appear at m/z = 656 (15%) (1) and 608
(76%) (2).

Complexes 1 and 2 were used as metalloligands
through the electronically rich sulfur atom, which has lone electron
pairs that can be donated to metal cations. Then, the treatment of 1 with equimolecular amounts of [Au(OTf)(PPh3)]
or AgOTf gave the bimetallic Au(III)–Au(I) (3)
or Au(III)–Ag(I) (4) complexes as yellow or white,
respectively, air- and moisture-stable solids (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Complexes 3 and 4
The IR spectra of 3 and 4 show
the absorption
for the anion trifluoromethanesulphonate around 1265, 1230, 1170,
and 1023 cm–1. The typical absorption of the pentafluorophenyl
groups appear around 1500 (s), 965 (s), 813 (m), and 800 (m) cm–1. The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 displays resonances for the 2-aminothiophenol ligand and phenyl
rings in the appropriate ratio. The 31P{1H}
NMR spectrum of 3 shows a single resonance for the phosphorus
of the triphenylphosphine group. Two different pentafluorophenyl moieties,
with free rotation in the ring, can be identified in the 19F NMR spectra of 3 and 4.

The reaction
of complex 2 with the gold(III) derivative
[Au(C6F5)3(tht)] (tht = tetrahydrothiophene)
afforded the unexpected binuclear gold(III)–gold(I) complex 5 as a yellow air- and moisture-stable solid (Scheme 3). The gold(III) of the starting
material, [Au(C6F5)3(tht)], has been
reduced to gold(I), and the oxidation of pentafluorophenyl with the
formation of decafluorobiphenyl has taken place. The latter compound
has been easily identified in the 19F NMR spectrum of complex 5. Additionally, this compound can be prepared by reaction
of the starting complex 2 with [Au(C6F5)(tht)].

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Complex 5
The IR spectrum of complex 5 shows
the absorptions
of pentafluorophenyl groups bonded to gold(I) at 1485, 948, and 784
cm–1 and those bonded to Au(III) at 1505, 959, 815,
and 794 cm–1. The 1H NMR spectrum shows
the expected resonances for the ligand with a different chemical shift.
In the 19F NMR spectrum, the three signals corresponding
to the gold(I) fragment and the six signals corresponding to the gold(III)
fragment were observed in an appropriate ratio.

The crystal
structure of complex 5 has been determined
by an X-ray diffraction study (Figure 2). Two different crystals in a 95.5:4.5 ratio were
identified in compound 5. Only four gold atoms of the
minority crystal could be detected. Several attempts to crystallize
a single crystal were unfruitful; in all of the cases, a similar twinning
was observed. The complex crystallizes in the triclinic P1̅ space group as a tetramer formed by an intermolecular gold(I)–gold(I)
interaction of 3.054(1) Å. Moreover, there are short intramolecular
gold(I)–gold(III) distances of 3.175(1) and 3.214(1) Å
which indicate a high degree of metal–metal interaction. These
distances are shorter than those found in other multinuclear gold(I)–gold(III)
complexes, for example, the tetranuclear complex [(C6F5)3Au(μ2-2-SC6H4NH2)(AudppmAu)(μ2-2-SC6H4NH2)Au(C6F5)3] (dppm = PPh2CH2PPh2) with the
2-aminothiophenol ligand [Au(III)–Au(I) from 3.2812(7) to 3.4052(7)
Å],8f or with the bridging sulfido
ligands in [(C6F5)2Au{μ-(S(Au2dppf)}2]OTf for which the shortest distance found
is 3.2195(8) Å.14 Ignoring metal–metal
interactions, the gold atoms show in 5 the characteristic
geometry of each oxidation number, that is, square planar for gold(III)
and linear for gold(I) atoms.

The reactivity of gold–amine complexes with isocyanide molecules
to give the corresponding acyclic diaminocarbene complexes has been
established for amine gold(I) and gold(III) derivatives.13 In this work, the reaction of 1 or 2 with an equimolecular amount of the corresponding
isocyanide CNR (R = cyclohexyl, 2-naphthyl) gives complexes 6–8 in which the nucleophilic attack of the amine to
the isocyanide carbon produces the formation of unprecedented bidentate
S^C acyclic diaminocarbenes (Scheme 4). Compounds 6–8 are synthesized
as off-white air- and moisture-stable solids. Their 1H
NMR spectra show the resonances assigned to the protons of the thiolate
ligands and the signals characteristic of the substituents of the
former isocyanide group in the appropriate ratio. The 19F NMR spectra of complexes indicate that the pentafluorophenyl rings
can rotate at room temperature. In the ESI+ mass spectra,
the fragments [M + Na]+ (6) and [M + H]+ (8) appear at m/z (%) = 787 (51) and 717 (100), respectively.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Complexes 6–8
The structure of complex 8 in the solid state
has
been solved by an X-ray diffraction study (Figure 3). It crystallizes in the monoclinic P2(1)/n space group with one molecule in
the asymmetric unit. The gold(III) center is in a distorted square-planar
geometry. The mean deviation from the plane formed by the four donor
atoms of the gold center is 0.0475 Å (S1, C29, C11, and C21).
The angles around the gold(III) atom range from 84.40(16)° to
93.39(15)°. The six-membered AuC3SN chelate ring adopts
a boat conformation, as shown in Figure 3, with the Au atom and the methylene carbon
lying on the same side of the plane of the other four atoms, C2SN, which are almost coplanar (similar boat conformations
were observed for some of us in the bidentate C∧N gold(III) acyclic carbene derivatives reported in ref (13g)).

Conclusions
In summary, new gold(III) complexes with aminothiolate ligands
have been synthesized. These compounds are very stable and have allowed
the preparation of polynuclear species by reaction with gold(I) or
silver(I) moieties, in which these metals coordinate to the thiolate
sulfur atom. Interestingly, the reaction with other gold(III) centers
in the form of a tris(pentafluorophenyl) derivative produces reduction
to gold(I) and oxidation of the two pentafluorophenyl units to form
decafluorobiphenyl. In this case, it is probable that bulky aryl groups
preclude the formation of the corresponding thiolate ligand bridging
to bulky gold(III) fragments. An interesting tetranuclear species
is formed which shows the presence of short gold(I)···gold(I)
and also unusually short gold(I)···gold(III) interaction
contacts. In addition, these heterofunctional amine–thiolate
complexes serve as excellent platforms to form unprecedented S^C bidentate
acyclic diaminocarbenes by reaction with isocyanides. These complexes
are very stable and may be adequate for biological studies.

Experimental
Section
Instrumentation
C, H, N, and S analyses were carried
out with a PerkinElmer 2400 microanalyzer. Mass spectra were recorded
on a VG AutoSpec with the ESI technique. 1H, 13C{1H}, and 19F NMR, including 2D experiments,
were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer
(1H, 400, 19F, 376.5, 13C, 100.6, 31P 162 MHz) and Bruker 300 spectrometer (1H, 300, 19F, 282.4, 13C 75.5, 31P 121.5 MHz)
with chemical shifts (δ, ppm) reported relative to the solvent
peaks of the deuterated solvents.

Starting Materials
The starting materials [Au(C6F5)2(OEt2)2]ClO415 and [Au(C6F5)3(tht)]16 were prepared by
published procedures. [Au(OTf)(PPh3)] was obtained by the
reaction of [AuCl(PPh3)]17 with
Ag(OTf) in dichloromethane and used in situ. All other reagents were
commercially available. Solvents were used as received without purification
or drying.

Caution: Perchlorate salts with organic
cations might be explosive.

Crystallography
Data were registered on a Bruker SMART
1000 CCD diffractometer. The crystals were mounted on glass fibers
using inert oil and transferred to the cold gas stream of the diffractometer.
Data were collected using monochromated MoKα radiation (λ
= 0.71073) in ω scans. Absorption corrections based on multiple
scans were applied with the program SADABS. The structures were solved
by direct methods and refined on F2 using
the program SHELXL-2016.18 All nonhydrogen
atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were included using
a riding model. Two different crystals in a 95.5:4.5 ratio were identified
in compound 5. Only the four gold atoms of the minority
crystal could be detected. Structure was refined as two fragments
with the Part instruction. CCDC deposition numbers 1846294 (5) and 1846295 (8) contain the supplementary
crystallographic data. These data can be obtained free of charge from
The Cambridge Crystallography Data Center.
