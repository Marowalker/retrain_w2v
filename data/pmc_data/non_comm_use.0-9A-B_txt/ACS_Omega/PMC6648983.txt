The facet-dependent redox reactions
of diruthenium metal–string
complexes by gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are explored by using the
surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique. Gold nano-rhombic
dodecahedrons (AuRDs), gold nanocubes (AuNCs), and gold octahedrons
(AuOhs) with exclusive facets {110}, {100}, and {111}, respectively,
were synthesized. These AuNPs linked face-to-face by metal–string
complexes Ru2M(dpa)4Cl2 (dpa = dipyridyl
amino, M = Ni, Cu) with chloride axial ligands serve as both SERS
substrates and reducing agents in the reactions. We employ the diruthenium
core in these complexes with multiple redox states to study the reduction
ability of varied AuNP facets upon plasmonic excitation. In Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2, the Ru–Ru stretching
mode νRu–Ru str. lies at 327 cm–1 on the SERS substrate AuOh, but this band shifts to 313 cm–1 on the AuRD and AuNC. The diruthenium moiety was reduced to [Ru2]4+ by the AuRD facet {110} and the AuNC {100}.
The gold nanorods in the solution prepared with metal–string
complexes bridging head-to-head on {111} facets were used for the
SERS substrate. The SERS curves of the complexes in these self-assembled
head-to-head rods display νRu–Ru str. at 327 cm–1, which is assigned to having an [Ru2]5+ core. Hence, facets {110} and {100} have a
reduction reactivity greater than that of {111}. In Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2, the νRu–Ru str. is observed to lie at 312 cm–1 on AuRD, but shifts
to 320 cm–1 on the AuNC and AuOh. In the latter
cases, the diruthenium moiety was reduced to having a charge of 4+
with electronic configuration π*2δ*2, whereas the former case band at 312 cm–1 with
a weaker Ru–Ru bonding is also attributed to [Ru2]4+ but with electron configuration π*4. π*4 lies at an energy greater than π*2δ*2. The electrochemical SERS spectra of
diruthenium complexes were recorded to verify their oxidation states.
Conclusively, these results yield the reduction reactivity of the
following facet: {110} > {100} > {111}. According to the results
of
the redox reactions, the valence states of the diruthenium metal–string
complexes are verified. In the [Ru2]n+ core, n = 4 π*4, 4 π*2δ*2, 5 π*2δ*, and
6 π*δ*, and the νRu–Ru str. is 312, 320, 327, and 337 cm–1, respectively.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles
and various anisotropic nanoparticles are reported
to have heterogeneous catalytic properties. The catalytic reactivity
depends on the metal species, shape, size, and facets.1−9 Observations on facet-dependent reactions are reported. Zhang and
Wang described the high-index facets of gold nanoparticles having
better catalytic reaction rates for hydrogenation of 4-nitrothiophenol.9 Zhang et al. found that the gold atoms preferentially
deposited on Ag@Au cuboctahedrons with concave structures at the sites
of the {111} facets.10 Chiu et al. synthesized
the high-degree uniformity of cubic, octahedral, and rhombic dodecahedral
gold nanocrystals and found the facet-dependent catalytic activity
of gold nanaocrystals on reduction of p-nitroaniline.11 The gold mediates the electron transfer to the
aromatic nitro compounds to catalyze the reaction. They deduced that
the order of reduction of catalytic activity of the facets was {110}
> {100} > {111} and partially explained that this is because
of the
high binding energy of p-nitroaniline to the {110}
facet.11

Surface enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) is a sensitive technique
and has unique vibrational fingerprinting capability to enable identification
of transient intermediates of reactions.9,12 Hence, SERS
has been used to monitor the catalytic processes by nanostructures.
Besides, the nanoparticles can act as redox reagents. Huang et al.
observed oxidation of 4-aminothiophenol by silver nanoparticles during
SERS measurements.13 Kim et al. explained
that the hot electron released from the silver nanoparticles converted
Fe3+ to Fe2+ in their SERS detection.14 Wu et al. were aware of the redox ability of
varied nanoparticles and used it combining the SERS technique to obtain
the bonding strength of Ru–Ru in diruthenium complexes after
reacting with silver or gold substrates upon plasmonic excitation.15 Consequently, they determined the valence states
of the diruthenium core in trinuclear metal–string complexes.
These metal–string complexes are one kind of extended metal
atom chains (EMACs), having structures of four polypyridyl amido ligands
helically coordinating the metal ion line, for example [Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2] (Hdpa = dipyridylamine), as displayed
in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Structures
of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2 and
Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2
Wang et al. observed a direct plasmon-accelerated
electrochemical
reaction on gold nanoparticles.16 When
the plasmonic band is excited, this produces more hot electrons/holes
and accelerates redox reactions. Hence, in SERS measurements, redox
reactions can occur and the vibrational structure of products can
be measured in situ. In the present work, we report the facet-dependent
reduction of the heteronuclear EMAC Ru2M(dpa)4Cl2 (M = Ni, or Cu, structures shown in Scheme 1) by gold nanocrystals measured
using SERS. These complexes have axial ligand chlorides as the anchoring
group to bridge the surfaces of gold nanocrystals. Because of the
multinuclear system these complexes have several redox potentials;
hence, they serve as excellent candidates for evaluating the redox
ability of nanoparticles. The diruthenium core can be [Ru2]n+, n = 4 (electron
configuration π*4 or π*2δ*2), 5 (π*2δ*1), and 6 (π*1 δ*1).15,17,18 We used two diruthenium complexes with different oxidation potentials
to examine the reduction activity of varied facets of gold nanocrystals.
Here, we synthesized octahedrons (Ohs), cubes, rhombic dodecahedrons
(RDs) enclosed by {111}, {100}, and {110} facets, respectively, with
a diameter of 50–60 nm to have hot electrons with energy near
the Fermi level during plasmonic excitation.

Because of complications
in this metal–string molecular
system, electrochemical SERS (ECSERS), which combines SERS and an
electrochemical technique, is used to obtain the Ru–Ru bonding
strength and then to identify their valence states. The absorption
during the redox processes can be recorded in situ to assist in assigning
the electronic structures.19,20 Diruthenium possesses
high polarizability; thus, intense Raman signal is expected. This
provides SERS detection with great sensitivity. In addition, understanding
the redox states of diruthenium complexes is essential for future
applications in their catalytic processes.

Results and Discussion
Physical
Properties of Various Shapes of Au Nanocrystals
Gold nanocubes
(AuNCs), Ohs, and RDs were synthesized using the seed-mediated
method developed by Chiu et al.11 The metal–string
complexes dissolved in ethanol were dispersed in acetonitrile (ACN)-containing
nanocrystals. All nanocrystals except spheres were surrounded with
surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) before adding complexes.
Gold nanorods (AuNRs) were synthesized using the method of Vigderman
and Zubarev21 covered with cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB), which was then replaced with CTAC; hence some CTAB
might remain around the sides of the rods but the heads were mostly
enclosed with CTAC. All the facets used for comparing their reduction
activity here were covered with the same kind of surfactant to avoid
possible complications. Only the nanospheres, which have varied facets
on the surfaces, have citrate as the surfactant. Detailed synthesis
procedures of these nanocrystals are described in the Supporting Information. The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
and extinction curves of the synthesized particles are displayed in Figure 1. The sizes of AuNCs,
AuRDs, and AuOhs are 51.0 ± 4.6, 68.7 ± 2.9, and 58.5 ±
1.7 nm, respectively.

Figure 1 (Left to right) Schematic drawing for the crystals face-to-face
bridged by Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2, TEM, SEM
images and extinction curves of without (black line) and with Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2 at various periods (time
interval ≈ 15 s) for the substrate (a) AuRD (scale bar for
the TEM image is 20 nm), (b) AuOh, (c) AuNC, and (d) AuNR.

In AuRDs, after adding Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2, the extinction curves recorded after each
15 s period display
a gradual red shift; the plasmonic band originally at 539 nm moved
to 683 nm then to 826 nm for forming longer chains (Figure 1a). The SEM and TEM images
show that AuRDs are linked face-to-face. For AuOhs and AuNCs, a similar
behavior of self-assembled and face-to-face chains in solution is
observed, as shown in Figure 1b,c. For rods of size 12.1 ± 0.7 × 29.4 ± 2.7
nm2 aspect ratio 2.4 ± 0.2, the longitudinal plasmonic
mode lies at 627 nm and is red-shifted to 772 nm when connected by
complexes. Long chains are depicted in the SEM images; the complexes
anchor on both ends of the AuNRs by chlorides in solution, forming
head-to-head chains.20,22 Ying et al. reported that metallaynes
with sulfide moieties can serve as connectors for gold nanoparticle
assemblies.23 Orendorff and Murphy reported
that AuNR has {110}/{100} facets on the sides and {100}/{111}on the
heads, and the bridging molecules mostly anchor on the {111} facets.24 Similar TEM images were obtained, and the schematic
drawing of the bridged surfaces is shown in Figure 1d. When the sample mixtures of AuNR/Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2 were deposited on a silica
wafer and let dry, the SEM image showed AuNR aggregates, not only
head-to-head but also side-to-side structures, unlike that in the
solution phase.

SERS and ECSERS Spectra of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2
The SERS spectra of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2 in the vibrational wavenumbers
of 200–450
cm–1 are displayed in Figure 2a–f. With substrate gold nanospheres
(AuNSs), AuRDs, and AuNCs, the SERS spectra (Figure 2a–c) of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2 exhibit an intense band at 313 cm–1, which is assigned to the Ru–Ru stretching mode, νRu–Ru str. of the [Ru2]4+ core, electron configuration π*4.15 The vibrational mode assignments of trimetal–string
complexes and ligand dpa– are described elsewhere.15,25−27 The metal-related modes lie in the wavenumber range
below 450 cm–1. Among those, νRu–Ru str. exhibits the most Raman intensity. For Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2 in solid form we obtained a broad band exhibiting
both [Ru2]4+ and [Ru2]5+ cores, indicating the crystalline samples having both valence states.15 The AuNS with varied facets has an oxidation
potential of ∼1.33 V, which can reduce the diruthenium core
from 5+ to 4+.15 On AuOhs, this band νRu–Ru str. lies at 327 cm–1 (Figure 2d); hence, the [Ru2] core remains as 5+. The SERS spectrum (Figure 2e) of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2 in the AuNR solution with complexes connected
on both ends of the rods using facet {111}, νRu–Ru str. is at ∼330 cm–1, close to that in the AuOh.
If the samples were prepared dry on a silica wafer to avoid the interference
of solvent signal, the SERS spectra (Figure 2f) display a broad feature for this νRu–Ru str. band, which can be deconvoluted to two
bands peaked at 313 and 327 cm–1, separately. Accordingly,
we have the mixed valence states of diruthenium cores [Ru2]4+ and [Ru2]5+. These aggregated
rods have hot spot regions including the side-to-side, which has facets
{110} and {100}; thus, a broad band feature is observed. Conclusively,
with a single facet only one valence state of the [Ru2]
core appeared. These SERS data reveal that facets {100} (AuNC) and
{110} (AuRD) with the bridging conformation in nanocrystals reduced
the complexes to [Ru2]4+. Facet {111} only yielded
the [Ru2]5+ core. Hence, the order of reduction
reactivity is {110}, {100} > {111}.

bands with the peak position indicated. The pound sign denotes the
ACN band and the asterisk the DCM. (h) Cyclic voltammetry in the DCM

deconvoluted bands at 313, 327, 333, and 337 cm–1 from the ECSERS curves and (j) absorption spectrum recorded in 0.1
M TBAP/DCM at −1.0 V.

From the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, two reversible
redox
potentials appear at E1/2 = +0.02 and
+1.06 V for oxidation of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2/[Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]+ and
[Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]+/[Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]2+, respectively,
as shown in Figure 2h. All voltages applied in this work are reported versus the Ag/AgCl
(saturated) reference electrode. These results agree with those of
Huang et al.28 They also reported the electroabsorption
curves measured at an applied voltage of 0.16/0.32/1.2 V, exhibiting
a near-infrared absorption band centered at ∼850/900/1100 nm
for the major species Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2/[Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]+/[Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]2+.28 Because the near IR bands of [Ru2] core lie close for the neutral and mono-oxidized species and the
small oxidation potential Huang et al. assigned the first oxidation
occurred for Ni+ → Ni2+ and the second
oxidation for [Ru2]5+ → [Ru2]6+. We further recorded the absorption curves at −1.0
V voltage for the reduced form of [Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]− ([Ru2]4+ core), and found that the absorption band is blue-shifted to ∼771
nm, as shown in Figure 2j.

The ECSERS curves at an applied voltage of −0.4 to
1.1 V
were recorded and are displayed in Figure 2g. We used 785 nm light as the excitation
source to resonance enhance the Raman intensity of [Ru2]5+,6+ because they have relatively more absorption at
this wavelength than the 4+ core to achieve a better signal-to-noise
ratio. Before the voltage was applied, the complexes were reduced
by the nanoparticles; thus, νRu–Ru str. appeared at 313 cm–1, which is attributed to the
reduced species [Ru2]4+[Ni]+. In
both measurements of CV and ECSERS, the applied voltage on the reacting
species is referred to a reference electrode. As the reference electrode
is the same, the reported voltages are the same in both cases. After
applying a voltage of 0.3–0.4 V, the samples were oxidized,
and the νRu–Ru str. band was broadened
and extended to the blue region and was deconvoluted to yield the
313, 327, and 333 cm–1 bands which are ascribed
to species [Ru2]4+[Ni]+, [Ru2]5+[Ni]+, and [Ru2]5+[Ni]2+, respectively. When the applied voltage was increased
to 0.8 V, the samples were further oxidized and the band was extended
to 337 cm–1. Up to 1.1 V, only band 337 cm–1 remained. This is assigned to the species [Ru2]6+[Ni]2+. For reduction, the voltage was tuned to −0.4
V, and the νRu–Ru str. band was broadened
(313 + 327 cm–1) to contain contributions from [Ru2]4+[Ni]+ and [Ru2]5+[Ni]+.

In Figure 2i, the
plot of ECSERS intensities of various bands versus the applied voltage
shows conversion among varied species. The intensities of the 313
and 327 cm–1 bands decrease with the applied voltage
and vanish at ∼+0.8 V. The 333 cm–1 band
appears near −0.2 V; the intensity increases first then decreases
to zero at +0.8 V. As those bands decrease in intensity with voltage,
the 337 cm–1 band first appears near +0.6 V and
the intensity increases with the voltage. Varied species have different
absorptions in the visible range. Hence, their Raman enhancement is
varied. Nevertheless, based on the variation in the band intensity,
we further verify the bands at 313, 327, 333, and 337 cm–1 to be [Ru2]4+[Ni]+, [Ru2]5+[Ni]+, [Ru2]5+[Ni]2+, and [Ru2]6+[Ni]2+, respectively.
The values of νRu–Ru str. and assignments
are summarized in Table 1. Stronger bonding strength in Ru–Ru for the [Ru2]5+[Ni]2+ core than for [Ru2]5+[Ni]1+ is obtained.

We
employed the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)
method UBP86/def2TZVP/W06 containing a split valence and a triple
zeta basis set to assist in assigning the electronic structure. All
calculations were performed using the GAUSSIAN package.29 The initial geometry used is the X-ray crystal
structures taken from Huang et al.28 then
was optimized using DFT, the same method and basis set as TD-DFT.
For the [Ru2]5+ core spin S = 3/2, we obtained the electron configuration π*2δ* similar to that of Huang et al. using method B3LYP.28 The vertical transition π* → δ*
in the near IR lies at 916 nm, close to the observed position 850
nm. Thus, this is a d–d transition. In complex [Ru2(OAc)3(bpnp)]+[PF6]− (bpnp = 2,7-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,8-naphthyridine) which bears a [Ru2]4+ core, spin S = 1 has νRu–Ru str. at 320 cm–1.15 This complex has absorption bands at 752 and
634 nm in solvent DCM (Supporting Information, Figure S2). These bands according to the TD-DFT calculations are
assigned to δ → π*/π* → δ*bpnp*
[molecular orbital (MO) of ligand bpnp mixed with metal δ*]
and δ* → δ*bpnp*/δ* → bpnp*, respectively.
The calculated band positions are 689/700 and 632/626 nm, respectively,
and the electron configuration is π*2δ*2. Here, the metal δ* orbital is filled; so supposedly
none of the near IR π* → δ* transitions exists.
This agrees with the experimental observation.

For the reduced
form [Ru2]4+, S = 1 of Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2, we obtained
a configuration π*2δ*2 for the optimized
structure and the bands in the red region lie at 735/771 nm, corresponding
to δ* → δ*L*/π* → δ*L* (L denotes
ligand dpa. MO of dpa mixed with metal δ*), transitions with
the characteristics of metal-to-ligand charge transfer. These results
are similar to those obtained for [Ru2(OAc)3(bpnp)]+. When we set the spin state S = 0 we obtained an optimized singlet structure derived from the
same configuration π*2δ*2 instead
of π*4. In this case, the bonding strength of Ru–Ru
would be expected to be similar for the same configuration. Although
the TD-DFT yields the absorption positions close to the observed 771
nm, the νRu–Ru str. observed at 312 cm–1, a weak Ru–Ru bonding, implies an electron
configuration π*4, instead of π*2δ*2, more electron on the π* antibonding orbital.
Method B3LYP was used to perform the same calculations. However, both
B3LYP and BP86 methods predict the lowest energy singlet and triplet
states for the [Ru2]4+ core with the configuration
π*2δ*2.

Conclusively, based
on the previous assignment15 and the results
of calculations, νRu–Ru str. = 313 cm–1 is assigned to the [Ru2]4+core
with the configuration π*4 and 320
cm–1 to the [Ru2]4+core with
the configuration π*2δ*2. Huang
et al.28 suggested that the [Ru2]5+ core has a configuration π*2δ*
spin S = 3/2, and our measured Raman shift νRu–Ru str. = 327 cm–1. For the
[Ru2]6+ core two configurations π*δ*
and π*2 are considered. Ren et al.16,17 reported Ru2(DMBA)4Cl2 (DMBA = N,N′-dimethylbenzamidinate) with
a Ru–Ru bond length of 2.3224 Å and assigned configuration
π*2. This complex has a vis–NIR band at 726
nm. However, the second oxidized complex [Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2]2+ with the [Ru2]6+ core has the NIR band at 1100 nm and Huang et al.28 tentatively assigned to have π*δ*.
Our measured Raman band νRu–Ru str. =
337 cm–1, a strong Ru–Ru bonding, indicates
that the π*δ* configuration is more likely. In addition,
using DFT UBP86/def2TZVP/W06, we obtained an optimized structure for
the π*δ* configuration, a Ru–Ru bond length of
2.331 Å, and calculated νRu–Ru str. = 330 cm–1. This seems to agree with our observations.

SERS and ECSERS Spectra of Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2
The Raman spectra of Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2 and [Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2]PF6 in solid powder are displayed in Figure S3. In the neutral and mono-oxidized forms,
the νRu–Ru str. mode is assigned to the
band at 325 cm–1. They correspond to the [Ru2]5+[Cu]+ and [Ru2]5+[Cu]2+ cores according to Huang et al.28 In this complex, the bonding strength of Ru–Ru is
less affected by the third metal ion. The SERS and ECSERS spectra
of Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2 are shown in Figure 3a–g. In the
SERS spectra, the νRu–Ru,str. appears at 315–312
cm–1 on the substrates AuNS and AuRD, but shifts
to 320–322 cm–1 on AuNCs, AuOhs, and AuNRs
(solution phase). Besides, the SERS spectra of the dry AuNR sample
display a broad band with deconvoluted bands peaked at 312 and 321
cm–1. On the basis of the observed wavenumbers of
the Ru–Ru stretching mode, our data reveal that the AuRD facet
{110} reduced the diruthenium copper complex to yield the [Ru2]4+ core with the electron configuration π*4 but AuNCs, AuOhs, and AuNRs to [Ru2]4+ π*2δ*2 In Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2 all nanocrystals reduced to [Ru2]4+ only with varied electronic configurations.

The excitation wavelength is 632.8 nm. (h) CV and (i) absorption curve
(−1.3 V) recorded in 0.1 M TBAP/DCM. (Δ is attributed
to the oxygen reduction.)

CV shows two reversible redox appearing at E1/2 = +0.19, +1.07 V, and one irreversible peak at −0.6
V, Figure 3h. Similar
results were obtained by Huang et al.28 Similar to the nickel complex, these are assigned to oxidation [Ru2]5+[Cu]+/[Ru2]5+[Cu]2+ and [Ru2]5+[Cu]2+/[Ru2]6+[Cu]2+, and reduction [Ru2]4+[Cu]+/[Ru2]5+[Cu]+. The ECSERS curves (Figure 3g) recorded using 632.8 nm excitation display
bands at 312–315 cm–1 for low applied voltages,
then a new band at 332 cm–1 appears at the voltage
of +1.1 V. The νRu–Ru str. of the [Ru2]4+ core exhibits an intense Raman signal for a
wide voltage range. The 332 cm–1 band is attributed
to the [Ru2]6+ core and the band corresponding
to the [Ru2]5+ core is unobserved here. At 785
nm excitation, the 312 cm–1 band is displayed under
the applied voltage up to 0.7 V, as shown in the Supporting Information. However, the higher wavenumber bands
are weak and very broad, not as clear as those using 632.8 nm excitation.
Hence, the ECSERS spectra only exhibit two species in the voltage
range −1.3 to 1.2 V. The absorption curve recorded at −1.3
V has a broad band peaked at 766 nm and extended to near-infrared.
From the results of ECSERS measurements, we assigned to the reduced
form with [Ru2]4+ core π*4.

Accordingly, using this copper complex, we have the order of reduction
reactivity of the facets as {110} > {100},{111}. Summarizing the
results
for both complexes, the order of the facets’ reduction reactivity
is {110} > {100} > {111} in gold nanocrystals. Table 2 lists the positions of νRu–Ru str. in various Au nanocrystals and their
assignments.

a SERS spectra of Ru2M(dpa)4Cl2 were recorded by 632.8 nm laser excitation.

Fermi Levels of Facets
Versus MOs of Diruthenium
The
observed reduction reactivity order is explained by the energy order
of Fermi levels of gold facets. Among them, the Fermi energy of {110}
should be the greatest. The Fermi level of bulk gold is around 5.53
eV.30 Comparing the energies of MOs of
diruthenium from the DFT calculations (reference to the vacuum level)
and our experimental observation, we propose that the π* of
[Ru2]5+ in the diruthenium nickel complex lies
between the Fermi levels of facets {100} and {111} to accept electrons
from {100} and {110}. The electrons on δ* are also moved to
π* to form [Ru2]4+ π*4. The diruthenium copper complex has slightly varied energies in
the high occupied MOs to differentiate the reduction reactivity of
the facets. In this complex, the hot electrons from all facets can
fill the half-empty δ* to form [Ru2]4+ π*2δ*2, and only {110} has Fermi
energy greater than π* to yield [Ru2]4+ π*4. Accordingly, the total energy of [Ru2]4+ π*4 is expected to lie above [Ru2]4+ π*2δ*2. This
agrees with the results of DFT calculations that for the lowest singlet
state of the [Ru2]4+ configuration π*2δ*2 is obtained. Figure 4 depicts the schematic relative energy among
the Fermi levels of gold facets and the π* and δ* MOs
of diruthenium ions to explain the experimental observation.

Conclusions
The
metal–string complexes Ru2M(dpa)4Cl2 with diruthenium moiety having various valence states
were used to serve as a probe to evaluate the reduction reactivity
of various facets of gold nanocrystals. The high-degree uniformity
of cubic, octahedral, and rhombic dodecahedral gold nanocrystals with
facets {100}, {111}, and {110}, respectively, were used both as reductants
in the reactions studied here and as substrates for the SERS measurements.
For each facet we only observed one certain valence state of diruthenium
ions, whereas in ECSERS other minor species remain in the solution.
Because of varied electronic resonance enhancement in Raman intensity,
the minor species might gain better SERS intensity than the major
species. This might yield a wrong assignment just based on the ECSERS
measurements.

Our data clearly yield the order of reduction
reactivity of the
facets as {110} > {100} > {111}. This order turns out to be
the same
as the observed order in the catalytic reactions. Varied facet indices
have distinct Fermi energies; thus, redox reactions can occur differently.
In these diruthenium metal–string complexes, the νRu–Ru str. at 312, 320, 327, 333, 337 cm–1 is assigned for [Ru2]n+ cores, n = 4 electron configuration π*4, 4 π*2δ*2, 5 π*2δ* with
Ni+, 5 π*2δ* with Ni2+, and 6 π*δ*, respectively. Because of the similar ligand
structure, these wavenumbers furthermore reveal the bonding strength
of Ru–Ru.

Experimental Section
Materials
Complex
Ru2Ni(dpa)4Cl2 and Ru2Cu(dpa)4Cl2 were synthesized following the
methods described before.28 Silver nitrate
(AgNO3), CTAB, TBAP,
and gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) were from Alfa Aesar, ACN, sodium bromide (NaBr), and sodium borohydride
(NaBH4) from Sigma-Aldrich, CTAC from Tokyo Chemical Industry,
and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium iodide (KI), ascorbic acid,
sodium citrate, and acetone from J.T.Baker. All chemicals were used
as received. Pure deionized water (Milli-Q Millipore, 18.2 MΩ/cm)
was used in all the preparations.

Synthesis of AuNSs, AuNRs,
AuNCs, AuRDs, and AuOhs
The AuNS was synthesized by using
the citrate reduction method.31 The AuNS
solution was used without being further
purified, and the diameter determined by TEM was 17.3 ± 1.5 nm.
The AuNR was prepared according to the seed-growth method.21 The synthesized AuNR is covered with surfactant
CTAB, called AuNR(CTAB). We replaced the surrounding surfactant CTAB
with CTAC through ion exchange method to form AuNR(CTAC). In brief,
AuNR(CTAB) after centrifugation was redistributed by CTAC aqueous
solution. This procedure was repeated twice. The gold nanocrystals
of AuNCs, AuRDs, and AuOhs were synthesized following the seed growth
method developed by Huang and co-workers.32,33 All the nanoparticles’ synthesis details are in the Supporting Information.

Raman and SERS Measurements
The Raman spectra were
recorded in a backscattering geometry employing an objective lens
(10×). The He–Ne laser (Lasos) operated with a red light
at 632.8 nm served as the excitation light source for gold nanostructure
substrates. The laser power at the sample region was set at ∼10
mW (for solid samples) and ∼1 mW (for SERS samples). The scattered
signal passing through an edge filter, optical fiber, and monochromator
(length, 0.5 m; grating 600 grooves/mm) was recorded with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled
charge-coupled device. The spectral resolution was maintained at 3
cm–1. The integration period per scan was typically
about 30 s and averaged for 5–10 scans for a spectrum.

In a typical SERS sample preparation, one or two drops of complex
in alcohol solution was added into 2 mL of nanoparticle solution.
Alcohol serves as a dispersing agent for anchoring molecules to the
nanoparticle surface. In some cases, when nanoparticles were covered
with surfactants, for removal of partial surfactants to obtain a sufficient
SERS signal, the Kumar and Thomas method employing solvent exchange
water/ACN (1:4) for anchoring molecules was used.19 For redox reactions, illumination by a 23 W fluorescent
lamp for 10 min was applied to make sure that the sample molecules
have completely reacted with the nanoparticles.

ECSERS Measurements
The ECSERS consists of a potentiostat
(CH Instruments), spectroelectrochemical cell (ALS), and a Raman spectrometer.
The cell was equipped with a Pt counter electrode and the gold working
electrode which were coated with AuNS and sample molecules. We used
the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode in the measurements, and
the applied voltages reported
is corrected to reference to Ag/AgCl (saturated) in order to compare
with the results from the previous study. The 0.1 M TBAP DCM solution
mixed with a very few number of metal–string complexes served
as the electrolyte. For near IR light resonance Raman detection, the
785 nm commercial Raman spectrometer (BaySpec) was used and the spectral
resolution was 8–10 cm–1. In the
present work, all voltages are the reported reference versus the Ag/AgCl
(saturated) reference electrode.
