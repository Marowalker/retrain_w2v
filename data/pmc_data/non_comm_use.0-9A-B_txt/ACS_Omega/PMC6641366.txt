In this work, donor−π–acceptor-type
four crystalline
compounds have been tested for the first time to restrict the corrosion
of mild steel in 1 M HCl. The details of the compounds are: C1, 4-N,N-dimethylamino-β-nitrostyrene;
C2, 2-(4-(dimethylamino) benzylidene)malononitrile; C3, ethyl 2-cyano-3-(4-(dimethylamino)
phenyl)acrylate; and C4, methyl 2-cyano-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)acrylate.
The corrosion inhibition potentials of the compounds have been primarily
investigated by electrochemical techniques, such as linear polarization
resistance, Tafel polarization curves, and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy. The secondary investigation is performed by scanning
electron microscopy, fluorescence surface imaging, spectroscopic techniques
(UV–visible and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), and
X-ray diffraction patterns. The results disclosed that 50 mg L–1 of the compounds (1–4) in 1 M HCl provided
the maximum inhibition efficiency as 93% (1), 88% (2), 82% (3), and
86% (4). The function of the compounds as corrosion inhibitors is
explained with equilibrium corrosion potential, adsorption isotherms,
and the frontier molecular orbital energies of the compounds (EHOMO and ELUMO)
estimated by cyclic voltammetry curves and UV–visible spectra.

1 Introduction
Inhibitors
are strategically developed materials for the inhibition
of metallic corrosion in various aggressive solutions. Generally,
inhibitors are directly added in corrosive media. During initial ionic
interactions, inhibitor molecules adsorb on the metal surface and
specifically retard cathodic or anodic or both corrosion reactions.
Because of numerous benefits of inhibitors, such as fast application
procedure, low price, and high anticorrosion potential, scientists
and researchers have tested several chemical moieties as corrosion
inhibitors.1−7 However, they have achieved good corrosion inhibition efficiency
only with the inhibitors having functional groups rich in aromatic
rings, heteroatoms, and π-conjugated molecules.8−15

Because of the facts quoted in above paragraph, the prime
focus
of the present work is set to test the inhibition ability of compound
1 (C1), compound 2 (C2), compound 3 (C3), and compound 4 (C4) to lower
the corrosion loss of M.S. in 1 M HCl. All of these compounds commonly
have a dimethylamino group at one end and different electron-accepting
groups at the other ends. This arrangement of the compounds creates
a unique family of push–pull-type materials.16 These donor−π–acceptor (d−π–a)-type
compounds can be categorized as organic charge-transfer materials
(OCTMs). OCTMs are widely used in optics and optoelectronic applications
because of their property of low-energy intramolecular charge-transfer
(ICT) adsorptions.17,18 The reason for the selection
of the compounds (C1–C4) for corrosion inhibition study is
because of their fascinating chemical structures and fluorescence
properties. These π-conjugated organic molecules are attached
with electron acceptor (dimethylamino) and electron donor functional
groups at the opposite ends, which make these molecules able to transfer
charges from donor to acceptor groups within the molecule.19,20 In general, an inhibitor is either a good electron donor or a good
electron acceptor. Hence, it is scientific and logical to use a chemical
moiety that has both electron donor and electron acceptor functional
groups for high corrosion inhibition efficiency via better chemical
bonding with the metals. As these compounds are also fluorescent,16 the surface attachment of the compounds can
be detected by their fluorescence properties. Additionally, these
compounds (C1–C4) are rich in heteroatoms (N and O) as well
as π-conjugated molecules; they meet with the specific requirements
of an active corrosion inhibitor.21−24 Therefore, we have investigated
the corrosion inhibition efficiency of C1, C2, C3, and C4 in 1 M HCl
by open-circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), Tafel polarization curves, linear polarization resistance,
UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), fluorescence surface imaging,
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The key results
of this work have illustrated that these compounds have remarkably
decreased the M.S. corrosion loss in 1 M HCl. To the best of our knowledge,
these organic compounds have never been employed to restrict the corrosion
loss of M.S. in acid solutions to date; they have great potential
for being promoted as corrosion inhibitors.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
of the Compounds
Powder XRD (PXRD) patterns of the compounds
were recorded to know
the crystalline behavior as well as symmetry of the synthesized chromophores
and are shown in Figure 1. The chromophores exhibited sharp diffraction peaks mainly in the
region of 10°–30°. The planes corresponding to various
diffraction peaks were indexed and are shown in Figure 1. In the diffraction pattern of chromophore
1, the most intense peak was observed at 13.9° corresponding
to the plane (0 0 4). However, the chromophores 2, 3, and 4 showed
the most intense peaks at 26.7°, 24.9°, and 16.1° corresponding
to the planes (1 2 −1), (2 0 0), and (0 1 1), respectively.
From the analysis of XRD patterns of the chromophores, it could be
stated that all inhibitors were crystalline in nature. The crystal
structures of the chromophores were reported as orthorhombic, monoclinic,
triclinic, and triclinic for compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively,16 which showed that the symmetry of the compounds
lowered from compound 1–4.

Figure 1 PXRD patterns of the compounds 1,2, 3,
and 4.

The bonding details of the chromophores
were investigated by FTIR
spectroscopy and are shown in Figure 2. The FTIR spectra of the chromophores exhibited vibrational
peaks in the region of 1400–1540 and 2890–3090 cm–1, which could be credited to C–C and C–H
stretching of the benzene ring, respectively. The peak of C=C
stretching vibration was recognized in the range of 1550–1622
cm–1 in the spectra with a large shifting toward
a higher wavenumber. That occurred because of the conjugation effect
of several electron-withdrawing groups present in all chromophores.
The additional spikes observed throughout the FTIR spectra were a
clear indication of Fermi resonances. Furthermore, the conjugated
nitro group in chromophore 1 produced strong bands near 1327 cm–1. The C–N vibration peaks of chromophores 2
and 3 appeared at 2218 and 2212 cm–1, respectively.
This slight shift of the peak position was caused by the conjugation
of C=O. Vibrational bands for C=O stretching appeared
at 1706 and 1712 cm–1 in chromophores 3 and 4, respectively.
The extent of vibrational shifting to C=C showed the effect
of conjugation with C=O and C≡N groups.

1,2, 3, and 4.

Figure 3 represents
the UV–visible absorption spectra of the compounds (C1–C4)
in an aqueous medium. In the spectra of all compounds, high-intensity
absorption peaks appeared between 421 and 439 nm that are the artifacts
of π–π* transitions in prominently π-conjugated
molecules.16,25,26 These transitions were observed in the spectra of the compounds
because of ICT from the donor of the compounds (N,N-dimethylamino) to various acceptors, that is,
nitrovinyl (C1), dicyanomethylidene (C2), cyano (ethoxycarbonyl)methylidene
(C3), and cyano(methoxycarbonyl)-methylidene (C4), of the compounds.
Furthermore, a decrease in the λmax value of the
absorption peaks was acknowledged for the chromophores 2, 3, and 4
with respect to chromophore 1. The decrease in λmax values could be attributed to the difference in the strength of
acceptor groups attached with the compounds, that is, from nitrovinyl
(C1) to cyano(methoxycarbonyl)methylidene (C4).

2.2 Electrochemical
Methods
2.2.1 OCP and Cyclic Voltammetry Study
All electrochemical measurements were recorded after 10 min immersion
of M.S. electrodes in electrolytes. The OCPs of M.S. electrodes were
monitored for 10 min; however, the OCP curves having the optimum concentration
of all compounds in acid solutions are shown in Figure 4. A careful analysis of the OCP curve in
blank 1 M HCl revealed that the M.S. started to corrode in the early
period of immersion and developed a layer on the surface. However,
only slight variations in OCPs were observed after 10 min, which could
be treated as a stable OCP of the M.S. electrode. Furthermore, Figure 4 disclosed that OCPs
of the electrodes shifted toward cathodic potentials with reference
to that in blank hydrochloric acid. This fact indicated that inhibitors
were more actively working against cathodic reactions with respect
to anodic reactions.27,28

Figure 4 OCP curves for M.S. in 1 M HCl at room
temperature with an optimum
concentration of the compounds.

Analysis of Figure 5 revealed that the compounds were showing high redox activity,
which
was good for bond formation and hence also for corrosion inhibition.
The main reason to perform the cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis was
to calculate EHOMO and ELUMO energies of the compounds, which could be calculated
by knowing the onset potentials of oxidation peaks of the compounds.
The onset oxidation potentials of the compounds (1, 2, 3, and 4) were
found as 1.007, 1.060, 1.13, and 1.03 V, respectively. The EHOMO and ELUMO energies
of the compounds were obtained and discussed under section 2.5.

2.2.2 Impedance Study by EIS
The changes
in the impedance behavior of M.S. electrodes in the presence of various
concentrations of the compounds (C1–C4) were investigated in
blank hydrochloric acid by EIS. Nyquist plots corresponding to the
results are presented in Figure 6. The graphical analysis of Figure 6 disclosed that the Nyquist plots for all
chromophores were in the shape of semicircles. Additionally, the shape
of Nyquist plots did not change significantly at different concentrations
of the chromophores. Both the facts suggested that corrosion as well
as corrosion inhibition of steel in pure HCl could be described mainly
as charge-transfer reactions. The shape of Nyquist plots also suggested
that the chromophores inhibited the corrosion process by suppressing
the charge transfer across the M.S.–HCl interface. However,
it was true that Nyquist plots of the compounds at either concentrations
could not appear as an exact semicircle, meaning that the steel–acid
interface was covered with the inhibitor molecules and showed deviation
from a perfect capacitor behavior. Uneven adsorption of chemical moieties
on the metal surface could be a strong reason of distributed response
current of M.S. electrodes, which appeared and often documented as
the imperfect semicircle shape of Nyquist plots.29−31 Furthermore,
the Nyquist plots of the compounds (C1–C4) exhibited that the
changes in Rct of M.S electrodes were
in perfect harmony with the concentrations of the compounds. This
fact suggested that specific adsorption of the compounds on the steel
surface was primarily responsible for the corrosion inhibition properties
of the inhibitors. However, the increment in Rct became limited beyond 50 mg L–1 of each
compound in the acid solution. As discussed above, the adsorption
characteristics of the inhibitors could affect their corrosion inhibition
ability. Accordingly, the corrosion resistance of the chromophores
could be placed in the order: compound 1 > compound 2 > compound
4
> compound 3 (Figure 7). This order of corrosion inhibition was also validated by phase
angle measurements. The phase angle for M.S. in blank acid was the
lowest, which represented the highest degree of corrosion. However,
addition of inhibitors in the acid solution caused an increase in
the phase angle, which could be related to the improved capacitive
behavior of the M.S. electrode in the presence of compounds (C1–C4)
and corresponded to lesser damage of the electrode surface than that
in the blank acid solution.32−34

(d) compound 4.

(b) Bode phase plots for M.S. in 1 M HCl

The inside details of
M.S. corrosion were further probed through
an equivalent electrochemical circuit, as shown in Figure 8. The term Rs in the circuit was used for electrolyte resistance.
The impedance responses of the compounds evidenced single capacitive
loops in Nyquist plots, meaning that corrosion of the inhibitor-modified
steel surface was a charge-transfer process having one time constant
(Bode phase plot). This single time constant was a projection of a
single metal–acid interface, and it could be defined with a
constant phase element (CPE) and Rct in
parallel. In the circuit, CPE was used to mimic the capacitive behavior
of the metal surface modified by the inhibitor/acid molecules.35−37 The mathematical equation for the total impedance Z of the circuit could be defined as 1  where ω is the frequency, α is
a parameter related to the CPE behavior of the electrode surface,
and Y is the CPE modulus. The equivalent capacitance
(Ceq) of CPE was calculated using the
equation38 2

electrical circuit for fitting of Nyquist plots.

All basic corrosion parameters, viz., Rs, Rct, α, Y, were
obtained by fitting the Nyquist plots and listed in Table 1.

Analysis of data listed in Table 1 revealed that Rct of the
M.S. electrode increased with the addition of the compounds in the
solutions. This increase in Rct was found
to be a function of inhibitor concentration; however, no valuable
improvement in the corrosion behavior of M.S. was acknowledged beyond
50 mg L–1 of all compounds. Such a concentration-dependant
increase in resistance values indicated that the compounds were self-assembled
at the steel–electrolyte interface and thus produced a barricade
effect to stop further corrosion of M.S. This statement could be connected
with the fall in capacitance values of the M.S. surface in hydrochloric
acid in the presence of inhibitors. The drop in equivalent capacitance
(Ceq) was consistent with the quantity
of the compounds. The lowering of Ceq with
inhibitor concentration could be justified either by reduction in
the charge storage ability or thickening of the protective film.39−42 The reduction in the charge storage ability of the M.S.–inhibitor–HCl
system with reference to the M.S.–HCl system could occur because
of the exchange of adsorbate (H2O) with the compounds,
which led to diminution of the overall dielectric constant of the
system. Further lowering of the dielectric constant as per the quantity
of the compounds in HCl solutions could be a result of the expansion
of the inhibitor layer (thickness wise). The fall in Ceq could also portray that the surface quality (density)
of the interfacial film of the compounds improved with the concentration,
which resulted in the reduction of the total surface area. Thus, Rct, Ceq, and α
value suggested that the compounds tested in this study substantially
impeded the corrosion loss of steel in HCl.

The Nyquist plots
explained that molecular attachment of the compounds
with the M.S. surface manifested in different EIS parameters, viz., Rct, Ceq, α,
and μRct. However, there
was no parameter revealing the adsorption behavior of the inhibitors.
Hence, isotherm models were employed to establish a relation between
adsorption of the inhibitors and the corrosion inhibition efficiency.
Different isotherms were tested to fit the EIS results; however, the
best fitting results were achieved with the Langmuir isotherm model.
The slopes and linear regression coefficient of the fitting lines
were close to one (Figure 9), which validated the selection of the Langmuir isotherm
to expound the accumulation process of the compounds at the M.S.–HCl
interface.

Figure 9 Langmuir isotherm fitting results obtained from EIS for M.S. in
1 M HCl with compound 1, compound 2, compound 3, and compound 4 at
room temperature.

The adsorption coefficients Kads were
obtained from the Langmuir fitting curves and used to quantify the
free-energy change ΔG° at the experimental
temperature (T = 298 ± 2 K) according to the
equation as given below43,44 3  where Csolvent denotes the water concentration in the
tested solution (1 ×
103 g L–1) and R corresponds to the gas
constant (8.314 J K–1 mol–1).
The ΔG° values (kJ mol–1) for the compounds (C1–C4) were found as −32.06, −30.31,
−27.73, and −30.20, respectively, which indicated that
both types of adsorptions (electrostatic and chemical) were partially
effective in the attachment of the compounds with the metal surface.45−47 This fact suggested that there is a possibility of chemical bonding
between the M.S. and inhibitor molecules that were first physically
adsorbed on the electrode. Hence, the free-energy change existed above
−20 kJ mol–1 (upper limit of physical adsorption)
and below −40 kJ mol–1 (lower limit of chemical
adsorption). Furthermore, the Kads value
of compound 1 suggested that the molecular adsorption of compound
1 was much greater than others, which was the clear reason of the
highest inhibition potential of compound 1 that resulted from a greater
coverage of the M.S. surface.

2.2.3 Tafel
Region Polarization Behavior of the
Electrodes
Different concentrations of the compounds were
added in hydrochloric acid, and quantity-based changes in cathodic
as well as the anodic polarization behavior of the M.S. electrode
were investigated in the Tafel region (Figure 10). Analysis of Figure 10 projected the fact that addition of the
inhibitors in acid solutions affected both cathodic and anodic polarization
curves. In addition, equilibrium of the electrodes was disturbed and
the corresponding corrosion potential (Ecorr) advanced in the cathodic region with respect to the pure acid solution.
Together, these facts suggested that the compounds restricted both
corrosion reactions eventuating at cathodic and anodic sites of the
M.S. surface; however, they did more effective inhibition of cathodic
reactions of M.S. corrosion.27,28,48 Further investigation of the Tafel curves predicted that the intersection
point of the curves shifted toward a lower corrosion current with
respect to the blank acid solution, which symbolized reduction in
M.S. corrosion loss in HCl solutions.

Figure 10 Tafel polarization curves
for M.S. in 1 M HCl at room temperature
with different concentrations of (a) compound 1, (b) compound 2 (c)
compound 3, and (d) compound 4.

Corrosion inhibition properties of the compounds were quantified
by estimating the kinetic corrosion standards, such as Icorr as current per cm2 at the equilibrium
conditions, Ecorr, and slopes of polarization
curves in the Tafel region (ba, anodic; bc, cathodic), by fitting the polarization curves
with CHI 7041C software (CH Instruments, USA). The parameters are
listed in Table 2.
A close observation of the changes in Ecorr values revealed that addition of the compounds in HCl solutions
modified the M.S. electrode surface, which were manifested through
shifting of the corrosion potentials. The Ecorr values of the inhibited electrodes were more negative with respect
to that of the uninhibited electrode. However, the maximum changes
in Ecorr values for compounds 1, 2, 3,
and 4 were acknowledged as 43, 34, 32, and 29 mV respectively, whereas
the changes at the maximum inhibitor concentration were reported as
27, 24, 27, and 29 mV, respectively. In any case, the shifts in Ecorr values were not greater than 85 mV. This
fact announced that the compounds were mixed-type inhibitors.49,50

Further analysis of Table 2 clarified that the existence of the compounds
in HCl solutions
materially decayed Icorr values of M.S.
electrodes in accord with the quantity of the inhibitors. However,
the decrease in Icorr became stable at
50 mg L–1 of inhibitors in HCl. The compounds could
be ordered as per the corrosion current values at the highest concentration
of inhibitors: C1 < C2 < C4 < C3. As the corrosion currents
could be considered as corrosion rates for comparison purpose, it
was obvious that the highest corrosion protection was acknowledged
with compound 1 followed by compound 2, compound 4, and compound 3.
Furthermore, the linear polarization resistance values RP were found to be increased with the inhibitor concentration
in blank acid solutions. The greatest increase in RP was recognized for compound 1. The order of inhibition
efficiencies of the compounds according to RP values was same as obtained for the corrosion current densities.
An increase in the RP value suggested
that the modified M.S. was generating lesser current in the environments
of the compounds rather than in the pure acid medium. In other words,
it could be stated that the resistance of the electrode against polarization
(nonequilibrium conditions) was enhanced in the inhibited solutions.
The additional increase in the polarization resistance with the increase
in inhibitor concentrations eventuated because of greater adsorption
of the compounds on the M.S.–HCl interface, which effectively
masked the active corrosion zones on the electrode surface.51,52 Thus, the compounds suppressed the electrochemical reactivity of
the surface and provided immunity to M.S. from corrosion in HCl.

To extract information about kinetic adsorption characteristics
of the compounds, data of polarization curves were fitted by the Langmuir
isotherm. This was done already for EIS data, but the purpose to perform
this study again here was to check the uniformity of information obtained
from the two experimental techniques working on different phenomena.
It was projected through the slopes and linear regression coefficients
(R) of the fitting lines that the Langmuir isotherm
was good in the prediction of the adsorption characteristic of the
compounds as both were close to 1 (Figure 11). The Kads values
(L g–1) for the compounds followed the same order
as obtained for EIS data. This fact reconfirmed that molecules of
compound 1 were more successfully adsorbed on the electrode surface
than the other compounds discussed in this work. The ΔG° values (kJ mol–1) for the compounds
(C1–C4) were obtained as −31.87, −30.63, −28.90,
and −30.34, respectively. This meant that molecular adsorption
of the compounds over the M.S. electrode eventuated because of physicochemical
interactions, which emulated the same information obtained by isotherm
study based on impedance values.45−47

Figure 11 Langmuir isotherm fitting
curves obtained from polarization curves
for M.S. in 1 M HCl with compound 1, compound 2, compound 3, and compound
4 at room temperature.

On the basis of the results of polarization curves and linear
polarization
resistance study, it was claimed that the inhibitors adsorbed exclusively
on dynamic cathodic and anodic sites of the M.S. electrode, which
prevented the M.S. surface from wild HCl attack. A quantitative enhancement
in proficiency of the compounds in restriction of M.S. loss was spotted,
which could occur because of widening/thickening of the molecular
layer of the compounds formed at the M.S.–HCl interface.

2.3 Surface Analysis
Figure 12a disclosed that there were
some scratches on the polished M.S. surface, which could be the result
of manual polishing of the samples. However, no crack was visualized
on the surface. Conversely, the surface became extremely rough and
small corrosion pits appeared on the surface as a result of intense
corrosion reactions in HCl. The surface morphologies in the presence
of inhibitors (Figure 12c–f) revealed that inhibitors significantly retarded the effect
of HCl on the M.S. surface by averting the growth of corrosion pits.
Few scratches, similar to that in Figure 12a, surfaced in inhibited samples, which
evidenced the effectiveness of the inhibitors indirectly. However,
surfaces of the samples were not as smooth as polished M.S. surface,
which indicated a partial damage of the M.S. electrode in HCl.

M HCl; and inhibited by (c) compound 1, (d) compound 2, (e) compound
3, and (f) compound 4 at room temperature.

2.4 Fluorescence Surface Imaging
As per
the report,16 the compounds also show fluorescence
in liquid as well as in solid phase. Hence, fluorescence properties
of the compounds were probed to know the M.S.–compound surface
interactions. Fluorescence (Figure 13) and corresponding optical images (Figure S1, Supporting Information) were collected after
3 h immersion in HCl by a Dewinter Fluorex LED, similar to SEM analysis.
A black image shown in Figure 13a indicated that there were no fluorescence particles
on the corroded M.S. surface, which was obliviously expected. Figure 13b–e disclosed
that compounds were adsorbed on the surface and emitted different
colors because of their different fluorescence properties.16 Thus, it was projected by Figures 13 and S1 that M.S.–compound interactions were taking place
in the acid and averting the surface from being corroded.

2.5 Electrochemical and Theoretical Approach toward
Corrosion Inhibition
The electrochemical techniques used
in this study disclosed that interfacial adsorption of the compounds
was the major cause behind retarded demolition of M.S. in hydrochloric
acid. The quantitative assessment of atomistic level adsorption (based
on ΔG° values) suggested that the compounds
could attach themselves with the metal via electrostatic attraction
as well as chemical bonding. However, the exact way of adsorption
could not be predicted for mixed-type adsorptions without taking the
amount of aggregate charge (Eagr) experienced
by the metal in the acid and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies of inhibitor molecules
into consideration. Hence, first Eagr was
determined by subtraction of the metal potential at the zero charge
condition (Eq0) from the corresponding Ecorr, as described in the literature.53 The Eq0 of a bare
M.S. electrode was reported as −485 mV versus Ag/AgCl in 1
M HCl (−530 mV vs saturated calomel electrode).54 On the basis of this information, it was easy
to disclose that the M.S. surface always carried positive charges
in each case (Table 2). This fact suggested that although protonated inhibitor molecules
could not initiate sharing of electrons with the electrically charged
metal (+), electrovalent bond formation could occur between the two
because of the chloride ion-modified M.S. surface.55,56 Chloride ions could attract protonated inhibitor molecules toward
the metal surface, which promoted electrostatic coupling between the
metal and inhibitor molecules. Thus, a protective layer originated
at the M.S.–HCl interface and retarded further loss of M.S.
in hydrochloric acid solution.

For an explanation of the electronic
interactions occurring between the metal and inhibitor molecules,
the HOMO and LUMO energies of the molecules were estimated by UV–visible
and CV measurements. HOMO energy of molecules could be determined
from onset of the first oxidation peak in the CV curve by the following
relationship: EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.4) eV.57,58 Subsequently, ELUMO energies of the molecules were obtained
by deducing the optical band gap of the compounds (corresponding to
cutoff wavelength) from EHOMO energies.
Accordingly, both orbital energies of the molecules (EHOMO and ELUMO) were determined
and listed in Table 3. However, the standard EHOMO and ELUMO energies of an iron atom were adapted from
the literature and used for the interpretation.59

Table 3 HOMO and LUMO Energies of the Compounds
Calculated from CV and UV–Visible Measurements
inhibitors	EHomo (eV)	ELumo (eV)	ELH1 (eV)	ELH2 (eV)	
compound 1	–5.407	–2.967	2.108	3.660	
compound 2	–5.460	–2.877	2.198	3.713	
compound 3	–5.530	–2.874	2.200	3.783	
compound 4	–5.430	–2.797	2.277	3.683	
iron	–5.075	–1.747	 	 	
To know the direction of initial interactions between metal atoms
and inhibitor molecules, the differences in the LUMO energy of inhibitors
and HOMO energy of an iron atom (ELH1)
and vice versa (ELH2) were determined
and listed in Table 3. The values of ELH1 were lower than
that of ELH2 for all compounds, which
meant that the reactions represented by ELH1 were having a stronger tendency to occur than the reactions represented
by ELH2.60,61 In other words,
the inhibitor molecules could accept electrons from iron atoms during
initial interactions, which could lead to the bond formation. Later
on, some additional interactions between the compounds and iron could
also take place because of sharing of the electrons donated by inhibitor
molecules. This could occur because of the fast protonation of the
donor groups attached to the compounds in 1 M HCl (Figure 14).

Figure 14 Chemical structure of
the compounds.

To enrich the information
about the metal–inhibitor interactions,
the quantum chemical parameters were obtained by Koopmans’
theorem62 and listed in Table 4. According to the theorem,
the electron affinity (A) and ionization potential
(I) were, respectively, equivalent to −ELUMO and −EHOMO. On the basis of A and I, the chemical properties of the compounds,
such as electronegativity χ , hardness η , and softness σ (=1/η) were
evaluated and listed in Table 4.

Table 4 Quantum Chemical Parameters for the
Compounds Calculated with the EHOMO and ELUMO Values
compounds	I (eV)	A (eV)	ΔE (eV)	η (eV)	σ (eV–1)	χ (eV)	
1	5.407	2.967	2.440	1.220	0.8196	4.187	
2	5.460	2.877	2.583	1.291	0.7742	4.168

4	5.430	2.797	2.633	1.316	0.7590	4.113	
It has been reported earlier that the band
gap (ΔE = ELUMO – EHOMO) of a compound has a
direct relationship with the
corrosion inhibition efficiency. A low ΔE corresponds
to high inhibition efficiency and vice versa is also true. Also, it
is reported that low hardness, great softness, and high electronegativity
of the molecules lead to high inhibition efficiency.63−65 Analysis of Table 4 disclosed the order of the compounds as per ΔE values as: C1 < C2 < C4 < C3, which indicated that the
compound 1 was the most chemically active molecule among others. Also, Table 3 disclosed that both ELH1 and ELH2 of
compound 1 were minimum among the investigated compounds, which suggested
that electron-donating and electron-accepting ability of compound
1 was the highest among all studied compounds. This fact could be
correlated with the higher adsorption rate of the molecules of compound
1 (higher σ and lower η values than others) over the M.S.
surface and accordingly also with the lower corrosion rate. The order
established by ΔE values and quantum chemical
parameters was the same as the order of the compounds reported by
the electrochemical measurements, which authenticated the explanation
of corrosion activity of the compounds based on frontier orbital energies
of the compounds.

Thus, it could be stated based on the free
energy (ΔG°), Eagr, and HOMO–LUMO
energies of the compounds that inhibitor molecules adsorbed at the
M.S.–HCl interface through physicochemical adsorptions. After
being adsorbed, the compounds produced a barricade effect for chloride
ions via covering the exposed area, which curbed the rate of M.S.
loss in HCl.

3 Conclusions
The
behavior of the M.S.–HCl interface was researched in
the domains of d−π–a-type four organic compounds
(C1–C4). The structural characterization techniques, viz.,
XRD, UV–visible, and FTIR spectroscopy, disclosed that the
compounds were crystalline in nature and rich sources of electroactive
molecules. The electroactivity of the compounds could be recognized
in CV curves. The polarization curves revealed that all compounds
acted on both corrosion reactions and lowered corrosion current densities
as to HCl alone, which were the manifested signs of corrosion inhibition.
However, the Tafel curves disclosed that inhibitors blocked the reduction
of moieties at the M.S.–HCl interface in a more effective manner
than metal ionization. This fact was well-supported by the relative
shifting of OCP and Ecorr of the inhibited
M.S. electrodes to the potentials negative to bare M.S. electrode.
The impedance behavior of M.S. suggested that corrosion inhibition
was acknowledged because the M.S.–HCl interface was protected
by a layer of the compounds. The resistance of this layer was comparatively
higher than the oxide layer developed in the blank acid solution,
which corresponded to a less corroded M.S. surface. Low capacitances
of the protective layers also manifested the same fact, that is, retarded
oxidation (corrosion). The prime reason for inhibition was molecular
adsorption of compounds over the steel electrode, which could be justified
with the Langmuir model and fluorescence surface imaging. The adsorption
involved both physical and chemical interactions, as revealed by ΔG° values. The HOMO–LUMO energies of the compounds
disclosed that a chemical bond between metal atoms and inhibitor molecules
could form because of the donation and back-donation of electrons.
On the basis of corrosion inhibition ability, the compounds could
be arranged as: C1 > C2 > C4 > C3, which portrayed that the
corrosion
inhibition efficiency of the compounds was also dependent on their
crystal symmetry.

4 Materials and Experimental
Techniques
4.1 Inhibitor Preparation
4.1.1 Materials
Used in Synthesis
The
base compound for the synthesis of all inhibitors, that is, 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, was purchased
from Avra Chemical Private Limited. Prior to use, the as-obtained
compound was recrystallized using methanol. The other materials, viz.,
ethyl cyanoacetate (a), methyl cyanoacetate (b), malononitrile (c),
nitromethane (d), and ammonium acetate (e), were obtained from Spectrochem
Pvt Ltd (a and b) and S D Fine-Chem Ltd (c–e). All chemicals
(a–e) and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) of Sigma-Aldrich
USA were consumed in the synthesis as supplied without any further
treatment. All solvents used in the synthesis process were distilled
prior to use.

4.1.2 Synthesis Procedures
The synthesis
of chromophores (inhibitors) was executed as per the method described
in the literature.66 The synthesis and
the structural confirmation of the synthesized compounds have been
earlier reported by Gupta and Singh.16 However,
we used newly synthesized compounds for corrosion inhibition studies.

4.1.2.1 Compound 1
First, a solution
was prepared by mixing 24 mmol (1.85 g) ammonium acetate and 60 mmol
(3.25 mL) nitromethane in 12 mL of acetic acid. In this solution,
10 mmol (1.49 g) 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde
was slowly transferred. Then, the solution was refluxed for 25 min.
Thus, the prepared solution was dispensed into a beaker containing
water at ice temperature. As a resultant, precipitation of a red color
compound occurred. After filtering, the compound was washed thrice
with double-distilled water and dried completely. At the end, recrystallization
of the dried compound was completed in ethanol, and thus, the obtained
compound was used as a corrosion inhibitor. The yield of the process
was 86%.

4.1.2.2 Compound 2
First, 10 mmol (1.49
g) 4-N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde
and 10 mmol (0.66 g) malononitrile were weighed and mixed. In this
mixture, 0.15 mL (1 mmol) of DBU was transferred. The resultant mixture
was ground manually in a mortar with a pastel for 5 min. Afterward,
ice cold water was used to treat the mixture. At the end, the final
product of the process was obtained by filtering the mixture along
with drying the solid compound. Thus, the obtained compound was in
crude form and hence recrystallized in an ethanol–acetone mixture
to obtain pure a compound. The yield of the total process was 96%.

A synthesis process similar to that of compound 2 was adapted for
the synthesis of compound 3 and compound 4. Only, the changes were
done in the grinding time (60 s), and instead of malononitrile, ethyl
cyanoacetate (1.06 mL) and methyl cyanoacetate (0.88 mL) were used
in the synthesis of compound 3 (yield—90%) and compound 4 (yield—91%)
respectively.

4.1.3 Inhibitors
The
chromophores were
not easily soluble in water. Hence, we dissolved 10 mg powder of chromophores
in 1 mL of acetone and soaked this mixture in distilled water. Thus,
stock solutions of the chromophores were prepared. The required amounts
of the inhibitors were taken from the stock solutions and directly
added in the acid solutions for corrosion inhibition studies at different
concentrations of inhibitors.

4.2 Characterization
of Inhibitors
4.2.1 XRD Measurements
A PANalytical
X-ray diffractometer, Cu (Kα, 1.5408 Å), was employed to
record the diffraction patterns of the chromophores (powder). The
2θ range of the investigation was 10–90°, and the
scanning rate was kept at 3°/min.

4.2.2 UV–Visible
and FTIR Spectroscopy
The powders of the chromophores were
manually mixed with potassium
bromide powder in a mortar with a pestle for 10 min. The palettes
of the prepared mixture were made with the help of a small hydraulic
press. Thus, the prepared palettes were investigated by a Thermo scientific
FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700) for the presence of functional groups.
The transmittance mode of the instrument was used to scan the palettes
in the FTIR spectral zone of 400–4000 cm–1. Thus, the spectra of the chromophores were obtained and analyzed
by matching the different peaks of the spectra with the characteristic
peaks of the known functional groups.

The optical characteristics
of the chromophores were inspected by a UV–vis spectrometer
of PerkinElmer (Lambda 25) in the UV–vis spectral zone of 200–900
nm. For this test, 25 μL of inhibitors were taken from their
respective stock solutions and dissolved in 3 mL of double-distilled
water. Thus, the obtained solutions were tested by the UV–vis
spectrometer.

4.3 Test Specimen and Solution
The strips
(0.1 cm thickness) having surface dimensions of 5 cm × 1 cm were
cut from a M.S. plate of 15 cm × 10 cm area. First, the M.S.
strips were scraped by a Sianor b emery paper (made in Switzerland)
of grade 1/0 for 5 min. Afterward, the strips were grinded with the
emery papers of grade 2/0, 3/0, 4/0, and 5/0 for 5 min each. The final
abrading of the strips was done with a grade 6/0 emery paper for 10
min for a smooth surface finish of the strips. Afterward, the strips
surfaces were degreased with acetone (AR Grade), wiped with a tissue
paper, washed with double-distilled water, and dried at room temperature.
Thus, the treated M.S. strips were masked (open area—1 cm2) and employed for the corrosion experiments. For surface
study, M.S. strips of 1 cm2 area were used. The compositional
detail of M.S. strips according to weight percentage could be given
as: C-0.15, Si-0.18, Mn-0.030, S-0.024, P-0.03, and balance Fe. The
corrosive agent used for this study was AR Grade HCl. The stock solution
of hydrochloric acid (18 M) was diluted with an appropriate amount
of double-distilled water to prepare the test solution (1 M HCl) for
corrosion experiments.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
Both
Tafel polarization curve test and EIS experiments were executed in
a three-neck glass cell at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C)
and controlled by an electrochemical workstation CHI 7041C, CH instruments,
USA. The description of the electrodes used is as follows: an Ag/AgCl
tubular electrode (Metrohm, Switzerland) as the reference electrode;
a platinum tubular electrode (Metrohm, Switzerland) as the counter
electrode, and the test samples as working electrodes. OCPs of the
electrochemical systems were monitored; and the experiments were executed
in almost stable (less varying) OCP conditions after 10 min immersion
of electrodes in solutions.

In EIS experiments, the single sine
perturbation wave of 5 mV amplitude was applied to the working electrodes
at different frequencies ranging from 100 000 to 0.01 Hz. The
resultant impedance curves (Nyquist plots) were fit by ZSim3.20 software
and the technical parameters were extracted. Inhibition efficiencies
(μRct) were obtained
using charge-transfer resistance (Rct)
values at each inhibitor concentration by the following equation67 4  where Rcto and Rcti indicates the
charge-transfer resistance of the M.S. electrode in HCl for corroded
and inhibited samples.

Polarization behavior of the M.S. electrode
in pure HCl and in
the presence of inhibitors were studied by varying the potential from
cathodic to anodic direction in the region of OCP ± 250 mV (against
Ag/AgCl reference electrode) at a rate of 30 mV/min. The polarization
curves were fitted by CHI 7041C software. The other corrosion parameters
of polarization, that is, current densities (Icorr), equilibrium potentials (Ecorr), and linear polarization resistances (RP) were extracted from the curves. Polarization inhibition efficiencies
(μP) as well as linear polarization inhibition efficiencies
(μPR) were calculated by the following equations68 5  where Icorro and Icorri are the corrosion
current densities in blank acid solutions and inhibited solutions,
respectively. 6  where RPi and RPo denote polarization
resistances in inhibited and blank acid solutions, respectively.

To probe the electrochemical behavior of the compounds, the current–voltage
characteristics of the chromophores were tested by CV experiments.
The details are as follows: supporting electrolyte, 5 mL of 0.1 M
tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in dichloromethane & acetonitrile
(1:1 by volume); working electrode, platinum; counter electrode, platinum
foil; and reference electrode, Ag/AgCl. For the experiments, stock
solutions of the chromophores were prepared by dissolving 1 mg of
each in 200 μL of dichloromethane. An amount equal to 20 μL
of thus-prepared stock solutions was employed for CV experiments.

4.5 SEM Measurements
The effects of chromophores
on M.S. corrosion were investigated via surface morphology changes,
captured by a SUPRA 40 scanning electron microscope of Carl Zesis,
Germany. For SEM analysis, the prepared M.S. strips (section 2.3) were dipped in blank 1
M HCl and in acid media containing optimum concentrations of the chromophores
for 3 h. Afterward, the immersed M.S strips were pulled out, washed
under a fine stream of distilled water, and dried with a tissue paper
followed by placing it in a hot oven at 35 °C for 5 min. Thus,
the arranged samples were examined for surface changes.
