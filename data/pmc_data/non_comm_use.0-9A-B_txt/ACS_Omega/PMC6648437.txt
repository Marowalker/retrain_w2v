The roles of benzoic acid and its
derivatives in the photocatalytic
degradation of tartrazine (TZ) by titanium dioxide have been studied.
A series of comparative experiments were carried out, such as the
experimental comparisons of concentrations, pH values, effects on
the para-position of benzoic acid, gas atmospheres, and different
target pollutants. It should be noted that the degradation rate of
TZ solution without benzoic acid and benzoic acid after degradation
for 90 min was 28.69 and 99.08%, respectively. The reason for the
above results is that benzoic acid acts as an electron donor to react
with photogenerated holes, suppressing the recombination of photogenerated
holes and electrons, and thus causing a significant increase in the
degradation rate. Moreover, the degradation process is mainly induced
by O2•– and photogenerated holes
(h+). It is the first time that the benzoic acid/TiO2 system has been used to degrade the TZ dye. In addition,
the benzoic acid/TiO2 system is also suitable for the degradation
of other organic dyes such as methyl orange, rhodamine B, methylene
blue, and methyl violet.

1 Introduction
In today’s society,
the problem of environmental pollution
is getting worse.1−3 For example, some azo dye contaminants, which contain
aromatic rings and N=N bonds, can be cleaved into aromatic
amines, which can lead to cancer.4−7 This is the most important cause of global
water scarcity and even poses a major threat to human health and living
conditions.8 Tartrazine (TZ, C16H9N4Na3O9S2) is one of many dyes used for coloring foods, medicines, cosmetics,
toys, food packaging materials, and the like.9−11 Moreover, it
is also used in the dyeing of wool and silk and in the manufacture
of lake color.12 Although it is used as
a food coloring, long-term consumption of foods containing excessive
amounts of TZ may cause allergies and diarrhea, may also cause hyperactivity,
and even affects children’s intellectual development; when
the intake exceeds the liver load, it will increase the burden of
self-regulation and cause some damage to the kidneys and liver.13−15 For these hard-to-degrade organic pollutants, conventional treatment
methods include chemical oxidation, physical adsorption, biological
treatment, and membrane separation.16,17 However, these
technologies exist to varying degrees, or the efficiency is low, the
pollutants cannot be completely harmless, and secondary pollution
is easy to occur, or the scope of use is limited, not broad enough,
and can only be applied to specific pollutants, or the energy consumption
is relatively high, and it cannot meet the shortcomings of large-scale
application promotion.18−20 At this time, photocatalytic oxidation has attracted
people’s attention because of its advantages such as high processing
efficiency, simple process equipment, easy control of operating conditions,
no secondary pollution, easy availability of catalytic materials,
and the potential to directly use sunlight as a reaction source.21−23

Titanium dioxide is one of the earliest and most widely developed
photocatalysts. Although it has been reported in the literature that
a certain amount of titanium dioxide may cause some harm to itself
in a few days, a small amount of sample is not very influential.24−26 In addition, because of its low cost, wide range of materials, and
can be carried out without selective catalytic oxidation, titanium
dioxide is mainly used in environmentally friendly organic synthesis,
the degradation of organic pollutants, and photocatalytic hydrogen
production.27−29 Although titanium dioxide has many advantages, its
disadvantages cannot be ignored. According to the existing theoretical
basis, when the metal oxide photocatalyst receives light with a higher
energy than its band gap energy, two types of photocarriers are generated:
photogenerated electrons and electron holes.30 The use of titanium dioxide as a photocatalyst has two most prominent
disadvantages: a higher recombination rate of photogenerated electrons
and holes and a relatively wide band gap.31−33 Therefore,
a lot of effective approaches have been developed to improve the photocatalytic
properties of titanium dioxide,34 for instance,
titanium dioxide is doped with a transition metal,35 deposited with a noble metal,36 and added with an electron donor or acceptor.37 Among them, the electron donor or acceptor is provided
for the reaction system, the operation is simple and feasible, and
the degradation efficiency can be effectively improved, which has
attracted the attention of many researchers.38−40 The addition
of these electron donors, such as glycerol,41 formaldehyde,42 formic acid,39 and oxalic acid,43 can inhibit the recombination of two types of photocarriers because
they can react with holes. Li and his colleague found that oxalic
acid can promote the photocatalytic process of some titanium dioxide,40 and Wang et al. further proposed that the effect
of small molecular weight acids on some titanium dioxide photocatalytic
systems is particularly good.44 Wang and
Liu et al. reported the excellent effect of oxalic acid and formic
acid in the titanium dioxide photocatalytic system, confirming the
role of small molecular weight acids in the above system.45,46 All in all, because small molecular weight acids act as electron
donors among photocatalytic systems, the catalytic performance can
be greatly improved.

Although there have been many reports on
the modification of titanium
dioxide, there are not many reports on the effects of aromatic acids
in photocatalytic systems. Here, the choice of methyl orange (MO),
rhodamine B (RhB), methylene blue (MB), and methyl violet (MV) as
the target pollutants, the selection of TZ because of its difficult
biodegradability, and the other dyes are common and easy to get, the
price is right. The acid represented by benzoic acid and its para-substituted
aromatic acids is used to explore the synergistic effect of acid with
titanium dioxide in the degradation of TZ system with small molecular
weight acids. In this process, the effects of important factors such
as pH of solution, structure of benzoic acid with different substituents,
free-radical scavenger, and amount of acid on the effect of the system
were also studied in more detail.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Effect of pH and the Concentration
of Benzoic
Acid
The roles of the amount of benzoic acid on the titanium
dioxide catalytic degradation of the TZ system are given in Figure 1a. It can be seen
from the data in the figure that the degradation efficiency of TZ
can be increased with the mass of benzoic acid from 0 to 0.10 g, and
its efficiency is increased from 28.65 to 99.08%. This is consistent
with the fact that benzoic acid acts as an electron donor to react
with photogenerated holes in the TZ degradation system, thereby reducing
the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. Nevertheless,
when the mass of benzoic acid in the system increased from 0.05 to
0.10 or even 0.15 g, the degradation rate of TZ increased only from
97.06 to 99.08 and 99.12%, respectively, with almost no significant
improvement. This may be because the photogenerated holes generated
by a certain amount of titanium dioxide in the degradation system
have been completely consumed by the electron donor of benzoic acid,
so that the change in the degradation efficiency of TZ is not very
obvious when the amount of benzoic acid is increased again. This means
that the degradation efficiency of TZ does not necessarily increase
with the increase in the amount of benzoic acid, which requires finding
a suitable concentration of benzoic acid.

Figure 1 Effect of pH and the
concentration of benzoic acid on catalytic
degradation of TZ by titanium dioxide. (a) Benzoic acid concentration
(CTZ = 20 mg/L, mTiO2 = 0.1 g); (b) solution pH (CTZ = 20 mg/L, mTiO2 = 0.1 g).

In addition, the specific
effect of the pH of the reaction system
on the degradation efficiency of TZ was verified by a series of tests,
each of which adjusted the pH of the solution. In this experiment,
a total of 3, 4, 6, and 8 specific pH values were set. It can be seen
from Figure 1b that
the final degradation results of the reaction system at pH = 3 and
pH = 4 are almost the same, with 99.39 and 99.07% being almost completely
degraded. However, the continuous increase in pH reduces the degradation
efficiency; especially at pH = 8, the degradation efficiency of the
system is as low as 3.91%. This indicates that pH = 3 is the best
in the degradation test of TZ at four pH values, and the adsorption
and degradation effects of TZ decrease with increasing pH in this
interval. The decrease in pH in the solution means that more protons
in the system can be used to protonate the reactive groups, resulting
in enhanced adsorption of the dye on titanium dioxide, which in turn
leads to an enhanced degradation effect.47 All in all, it can be concluded that the acidic conditions favor
the degradation of TZ by the benzoic acid/TiO2 system,
whereas the alkaline conditions are not conducive to the degradation
of TZ by the benzoic acid/TiO2 system.

2.2 Effect of Ion Traps and Gas Atmosphere on
Degradation of TZ
It is known that there are many kinds of
active radicals in the photocatalytic degradation system of organic
pollutants in general, but the role of each reactive group in the
system is generally not the same, and further experimental verification
is needed. Furthermore, it is necessary to further combine different
degradation experiments for comparison. The results of the degradation
experiments under different gas atmospheres were comprehensively considered.
It is worth mentioning that the more the degradation efficiency is
reduced, the more important the role played by this reactive free
radical in the degradation system.

After a series of ion trapping
experiments, it was found that the degradation curves after adding
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium and 1,4-p-benzoquinone were significantly different from that of the blank
group. In other words, photogenerated holes and O2•– play a major role in the photocatalytic degradation
of TZ by TiO2/benzoic acid. It is noteworthy that the degradation
curves of the system after the addition of isopropanol and potassium
persulfate were also somewhat different from the blank group. Although
the degradation efficiency of the two groups was almost the same as
that of the blank group after the irradiation time reached 90 min,
the degradation efficiency of TZ could reach about 94% within 40 min
after the addition of the above two capture agents.

Moreover,
combining the degradation effects of the catalytic system
under different gas atmosphere conditions can better prove the active
group that plays a major role in the reaction system. From the data
curves in Figure 2b,
it can be seen that the degradation curves of several systems are
different in the experimental comparison of the three insufflation
and blank groups and the gap becomes larger and larger with time.
It can be found that the degradation efficiency of TZ in the system
of argon and carbon dioxide gas blowing is reduced from 99.08 to 61.13
and 87.73%, respectively. This exactly coincides with the following
mechanism: O2•–, its major degradation
in catalytic degradation systems

and gas atmosphere in the photocatalytic
degradation of TZ system. (a) Different ion traps and (b) gas atmosphere
(CTZ = 20 mg/L, mTiO2 = 0.1 g, maromatic acids = 0.1 g, Cion traps = 1 mmol/L,
pH = 3).

2.3 Effect
of Para-Groups of Benzoic Acid
The graph in Figure 3 shows the comparison of various
positions of the substituted benzoic
acid as aromatic acids in the degradation of TZ. It can be seen from
the graphic display that the other four para-substituted structures
of benzoic acid and benzoic acid have little difference in the degradation
effect of TZ within 10 min, but the contrast between the effects is
obvious as the irradiation time increases, especially when the effect
of light is about 30 or 40 min. In the photodegradation stage, the
effects of the five benzoic acids in the degradation of TZ can be
broadly divided into three groups, 4-methoxybenzoic acid and 4-methylbenzoic
acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid, and benzoic acid.
Although the degradation efficiency of several systems can reach 98,
99%, or even higher after 90 min of photodegradation, however, after
60 min of degradation, the reaction system of 4-methoxybenzoic acid
and 4-methylbenzoic acid can reach about 98.51% and even about 95.06%
can be reached in about 40 min. At the same time, the degradation
system of 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-nitrobenzoic acid was only about
93.05 and 77.21% at 60 and 40 min, respectively. The efficiency of
adding benzoic acid is lower, only about 82.57 and 55.81%.

Figure 3 Role of para-groups
of benzoic acid in the degradation of TZ system
(CTZ = 20 mg/L, mTiO2 = 0.1 g, maromatic acids = 0.1 g, pH = 3).

In summary, in the experiment
of aromatic acid/titanium dioxide
as a catalyst for photocatalytic degradation of TZ, several acids
can be used as electron donors to react with photogenerated holes.
The reaction reduces the recombination rate of photogenerated holes
and electrons, thereby greatly improving the degradation efficiency
of the system. That is, the methoxy group and methyl group as an electron-donating
group have a better synergistic effect with titanium dioxide when
substituted at the para-position of benzoic acid than a chlorine atom
and a nitro group as an electron-withdrawing group.

2.4 Effect of Benzoic Acid on Photocatalytic Performance
Figure 4 shows the
photodegradation of the TZ solution, photocatalysis, and a comparison
of the degradation effects after each addition of benzoic acid. As
can be seen from the graphs in the figure, for the photodegradation
system of TZ and the benzoic acid system added by photodegradation,
there is almost no change in absorbance throughout the photodegradation
stage. That is to say, the TZ in these two systems is almost not degraded.
However, for the process of photocatalytic degradation of TZ, the
absorbance of the target contaminants has been decreasing in the system
after adding only 0.1 g of titanium dioxide. Although the magnitude
is not large, the final degradation rate reaches 28.69%. However,
after the addition of benzoic acid on the basis of the above system,
the degradation rate of the whole system was greatly improved from
the beginning of the light to the end of the reaction and increased
from the original 28.69 to 99.08% after 90 min of illumination. It
shows that the change of the degradation rate of the system after
adding benzoic acid is very obvious. The kinetic process of photocatalytic
degradation of organic compounds generally follows the following pseudo
first-order kinetic model  wherein, the meanings
of C0, Ct have
the same meaning as the related symbols in the above, and k1 represents the pseudo first-order kinetic
rate constant. As shown in Table 1, the kinetic rate constant of the benzoic acid/titanium
dioxide system is 0.050949 min–1, which is more
than 13 times that of the simple photocatalytic process (k1 = 0.003742 min–1). In addition, it
is 1306 times more than the direct photodegradation process (k1 = 0.000039 min–1).

2.5 Degradation of Different Target Pollutants
in River Water
Figure 5 shows the visible light degradation of target contaminants
in the titanium dioxide/benzoic acid system, including several common
organic dyes such as TZ, RhB, MO, MB, and MV. The comparison of the
degradation curves of the target pollutants in the figure is still
quite obvious. In the visible light degradation stage, the absorbance
of most pollutants will decrease with the increase of irradiation
time but the degradation of these substances is quite different. Among
them, the degradation efficiency of MO in the deionized water environment
is the lowest, only 13.32%, whereas the degradation efficiencies of
RhB, MB, MV, and TZ under the same conditions were 64.36, 74.89, 87.88,
and 99.08%, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the degradation
efficiency of TZ can reach 82.57% when the photodegradation time reaches
60 min, and it can reach 55.81% even when the illumination time is
40 min. This phenomenon is much stronger than the effect of MO and
RhB after 90 min degradation. Moreover, we can see that it is better
when using the river water to do the degradation experiments of the
above target pollutants, this may be because the water contains many
microorganisms that promote photocatalytic degradation. In addition
to the dye MO, the degradation of several other dyes is superior to
the degradation of dyes in deionized water.

Figure 5 Visible light degradation
performance of several common organic
dyes as target pollutants in deionized water and river water with
the benzoic acid/titanium dioxide system (Corganic dyes = 20 mg/L, mbenzoic acid = 0.1
g, pH = 3).

2.6 Effect
of Several Water Matrices
The degradation of TZ in four different
water matrices is shown in Figure 6. Several water bodies
are taken for filtration before they can be used for catalytic experiments.
We can find that the degradation effect of TZ in rainwater and pond
water is better than that in river water, which is better than degradation
under deionized water. We suspect that pond water and rainwater contain
a certain amount of microorganisms that can promote photocatalytic
degradation. After analysis, it can be known that the degradation
rate of TZ solution prepared with rainwater and pond water can reach
96.38% after 50 min of illumination, whereas the solution prepared
with river water can only reach 97.41% degradation rate after 70 min
of illumination. As for the deionized water, it takes 80 min of light.
This indicates that the benzoic acid/TiO2 system can also
be used to degrade organic dyes in actual water bodies, and it still
has certain practical application value.

of water matrix on the degradation of
TZ (Corganic dyes = 20 mg/L, mbenzoic acid = 0.1 g, pH = 3).

2.7 Stability of the Benzoic
Acid/TiO2 System
In order to ensure the stability
of the system before
and after the reaction, we performed scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests of titanium dioxide before
and after the reaction. Whether it is from the comparison of Figure 7a,b or the comparison
of Figure 7c,d, it
is not difficult to find that the surface morphology of titanium dioxide
has not changed substantially before and after the reaction. However,
it is worth mentioning that although there is a certain agglomeration
phenomenon on the SEM images of the same magnification, it can be
clearly found that the morphology on the outermost surface of titanium
dioxide is not much different before and after the reaction. This
suggests that the stability of the system before and after the reaction
is still good.

Figure 7 (a,c) SEM images at different magnifications of titanium
dioxide
before the reaction; (b,d) SEM images at different magnifications
of titanium dioxide after the reaction; (e) XRD images of titanium
dioxide before and after the reaction; and (f) photocatalytic degradation
rate of TZ using the benzoic acid/TiO2 system up to four
cycles after 90 min irradiation under visible light.

The XRD patterns of titanium dioxide before and
after the reaction
are shown in Figure 7e. By analyzing and comparing the XRD pattern of titanium dioxide
before and after the reaction with the standard card diagram, it can
be known that the crystal form of titanium dioxide before and after
the reaction did not change. This result is consistent with the obtained
SEM results, indicating that the stability of the catalyst system
is quite good.

At the same time, we also tested the stability
of the photocatalyst.
The experimental results are shown in Figure 7f. Because benzoic acid is used as an electron
donor in the catalytic process, that is, a sacrificial agent, it is
necessary to additionally add benzoic acid into the system in advance
for the next experiment. There is no significant decrease in the catalytic
activity of the benzoic acid/TiO2 system after four cycles
of the cycle test, indicating that the stability of the system is
relatively good and suitable for practical applications.

2.8 Photocatalytic Mechanism
Figure 8a is the ultraviolet
diffuse reflection spectrum, and Figure 8b is the forbidden band width information
of the material obtained by the Kubleka–Munk conversion. The
absorption band edge of the TiO2 sample is around 400 nm,
and the absorption intensity of ultraviolet light below 400 nm is
very high, and a small amount of visible light having a wavelength
of less than 600 nm is absorbed. In addition, from Figure 8b, the forbidden band width
of titanium dioxide is 3.05 eV. Figure 8c shows the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot
with 1/C2 versus potential. The linear
parts of the curves are extrapolated to 1/C2 → 0, and the values of Fermi level (UFL) are estimated to be 0.21 eV, which is CB = 0.12 eV for
the sample. According to the formula Eg = VB – CB,48,49 the VB of the sample can be obtained
to be about 3.26 eV.

equation vs the energy of the light absorbed of TiO2; (c)

of visible light photocatalysis process.

Figure 8d
shows
the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of TZ in the benzoic acid/titanium
dioxide system and the role of benzoic acid in the catalytic system.
After experimental comparison of different gas atmospheres, after
drawing, it was found that the degradation process of TZ was inhibited
in the system of argon and carbon dioxide blowing, but the degradation
process of TZ in the air-inflated system has been promoted. It was
estimated that oxygen in the air played a certain role.

Combined
with additional ion capture experiments, a degradation
curve was drawn and it was found that the degradation of TZ in the
system of EDTA disodium and 1,4-p-benzoquinone was
greatly inhibited; even with the addition of p-benzoquinone,
there is a rising trend in the degradation curve. The degradation
curve of the system shows a rising trend, and these two are the trapping
agents of photogenerated holes and O2•–, which can be presumed to play a major role in the photogenerated
holes and O2•– in the entire degradation
system.50 1   2   3   4   5  

3 Conclusions
In this experiment, aromatic
acids such as benzoic acid and its
derivatives played a very important role in titanium dioxide photocatalytic
degradation of the TZ system, which can greatly improve its degradation
efficiency, and the original 28.69% degradation efficiency was improved
to 99.08%. When 20 mg/L TZ solution was degraded, the optimum amount
of benzoic acid added was 0.10 g based on the mass of 0.10 g of TiO2 added. The optimum pH of the degradation system was 3, and
O2•– and optical holes (h+) play a major role in the degradation of the system. More
importantly, this combination is not only applicable to the degradation
of TZ solution but also applies to organic dyes such as MO, RhB, MB,
and MV.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TiO2 (99.8%,
anatase, average size 40 nm) was purchased from Aladdin Reagents (Shanghai)
Co. Ltd. Other chemical reagents were purchased from Shanghai Jingjing
Reagent Co. Ltd and Aladdin Reagents (Shanghai) Co. Ltd and were used
as received, unless stated otherwise. All solutions were diluted with
deionized water. The pH of the system was adjusted with a 1 mol/L
hydrochloric acid solution and a sodium hydroxide solution.

4.2 Experimental Procedures
In order
to control the variables and reduce the influence of various nonessential
factors on the experiment, it is a prerequisite to keep the temperature
constant during the series of experiments. Therefore, in the dark
reaction adsorption and photodegradation process, the reaction system
is always in the oil bath and the set temperature is about room temperature
(about 25 °C). It is worth nothing that a fresh, TZ solution
with a concentration of 20 mg/L was prepared prior to the start of
the experiment, which was obtained by diluting the mother liquor at
a concentration of 1.000 g/L.

At the same time as the dark reaction
adsorption phase begins, the high-pressure xenon lamp (300 W, PLS-SXE300C)
is turned on for preheating for about half an hour. After the reaction
system reaches the equilibrium of adsorption (i.e., the concentration
of the system does not change much, and the specific manifestation
is that the absorbance of the solution system does not change significantly),
the photolysis can be performed. Subsequently, a light source equipped
with a 420 nm cutoff filter and a reaction device were placed opposite
to each other.

From previous experiments, it was known that
TZ can reach adsorption
equilibrium in the presence of titanium dioxide and benzoic acid when
dark reaction adsorption reaches approximately half an hour. It is
worth mentioning that in all of the experimental processes, 100 mL
of reaction system was degraded. Therefore, in this basic experiment,
0.1 g of titanium dioxide and 0.1 g of benzoic acid were added to
100 mL of 20 mg/L TZ solution. Then, use hydrochloric acid solution
(0.5 mol/L) and sodium hydroxide solution (0.5 mol/L) to adjust the
solution pH around 3. Before the photodegradation process was carried
out, a mixed solution containing TZ, titanium dioxide, benzoic acid,
and derivatives thereof was stirred under a dark condition with a
magnetic stirrer for approximately half an hour in order to achieve
equilibrium of adsorption and desorption. A series of comparative
experiments, such as different concentrations of benzoic acid, experimental
comparison of different pH values, the effects of different para-positions
of benzoic acid, different gas atmospheres, and different target contaminants,
were performed. Furthermore, in order to confirm the role of aromatic
small acid such as benzoic acid in the catalytic degradation of TZ
by titanium dioxide, a series of experimental comparisons are also
needed, including photodegradation of TZ itself, photocatalytic degradation
of TZ in the presence of titanium dioxide, and the remaining two groups
of laboratories added benzoic acid to this condition based on photodegradation
and photocatalysis. Moreover, after the photocatalytic degradation
process begins, samples are taken every 10 min or so and about 3 mL
of each sample is taken. The removed liquid sample is filtered through
a 0.45 μm filter into a 5 mL centrifuge tube. The absorbance
test is used to determine the concentration change of the target pollutant,
and removal efficiency (RE) can be calculated by the following formula  C0 and Ct represent
the
concentration of TZ at the initial time and at each sampling.

4.3 Ion Capture Experiments
In order
to determine the role of each active free radical in the catalytic
system, a series of ion trapping experiments are needed and in order
to make the experimental effect more obvious, one ion trapping agent
should be added at each time for each group of experiments. In this
system experiment, EDTA disodium, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), isopropyl alcohol (i-PrOH), and 1,4-p-benzoquinone were selected as
the trapping agents for photoactive holes (h+), photoelectrons
(e–), hydroxyl radicals (HO•),
and superoxide radicals (O2•–),
respectively.45,51−54 The amount of various capture
agents can be known from the previous literature.45,54,55 Specifically, the amount of each capture
agent is taken as 1 mmol/L, and then, the ion capture experiment can
be carried out by calculating the specific amount of the respective
relative molecular mass.

4.4 Mechanism Analysis Method
It is well
known that the absorbance measured by an UV–visible spectrophotometer
can be used to accurately determine the degradation concentration
of a target pollutant in a photocatalytic system over time. At the
same time, combined with some of the previous experience and a series
of ion capture experiments, we can know which active groups are playing
a major role in the system of benzoic acid and titanium dioxide catalytic
degradation of TZ. Moreover, the results of UV–visible spectroscopy
show that the presence of benzoic acids in the TZ solution system
has little effect on the absorption wavelength (Figure 9a). For the target contaminant TZ solution,
prepare its standard concentration solution and test its absorbance
to obtain a standard curve and its equation is in Figure 9b.
