Fabrication
and characterization of water-resistant nacre-like
polymer/clay nanocomposites, in which clay platelets and hydrophobic
polymer chains are alternately stacked in parallel, are reported.
Hydrophilic clay was converted by an ion-exchange reaction with a
methacrylate monomer having a long alkyl chain and a quaternary ammonium
salt group at the end. The subsequent in situ polymerization bound
the neighboring clay surfaces, leading to the preferential orientation
of the clay platelets owing to their high aspect ratio. The composites
maintained excellent mechanical properties even after being immersed
in water for more than a day. Strong shape stability was observed
in water as well as in various organic solvents.

Introduction
Nacre, a natural composite
material that forms the inner layer
of sea shells, has attracted much attention as a model for high-performance
composites because of its extreme hardness and toughness.1−3 It consists mainly of platelet-like aragonite (CaCO3,
∼95 vol %) and a small amount of biopolymers alternately stacked
to form a well-defined layered structure, rendering excellent mechanical
performance.4,5 This unique combination of organic
and inorganic substances provides inspiration for new composite materials
having high mechanical performance. Various inorganic fillers with
a high aspect ratio, such as clay,6−10 graphene,11−14 and Al2O3 platelets,15,16 have been used to mimic nacre in composites. Clay is particularly
widely used because it is naturally occurring, inexpensive, and abundant.
Nacre-like polymer/clay composites with extraordinary mechanical properties
have been realized by techniques such as layer-by-layer assembly,6,7 water evaporation assembly occurring at an air/water interface,8,9 vacuum filtration assembly,10 doctor-blade
assembly,10 and so on. To obtain an ideal
mixture of clay and polymer, these techniques utilize an aqueous solution
of a polymer as well as an aqueous dispersion of clay. Water-soluble
polymers such as poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride),6 poly(vinyl alcohol),8−10 polyethylene
oxide,17 carboxymethyl cellulose,18 and xyloglucan19 have
been used in previous studies. The composites thus developed showed
good mechanical properties only under low ambient humidity. At higher
humidity, these waterborne nacre-like composites were hydrated, and
their mechanical performances were drastically weakened.20

In recent years, some efforts have been
made to overcome the humidity
and/or water sensitivity of polymer/clay nacre-like composites by
chemical/physical cross-linking18,19,21 and hydrophobic surface coating.22,23 Cross-linking
in the polymer layer and at the interface obtained by ionic18 and covalent19,21 bonds preserved
mechanical properties to some extent even at high humidity because
of the improved rigidity18,19 of the polymer layer
and the enhanced interaction at the interface.21 Notably, the introduction of covalent cross-links through
dopamine treatment in a cellulose nanofibrils/clay composite provided
good mechanical properties even under water.21 However, immersion in water drastically decreased the material’s
Young’s modulus and tensile strength by 91 and 84%, respectively.
Although previous approaches have lowered the sensitivity to humidity,
the resistance under water is still limited because they use water-soluble
or water-dispersible polymers as matrix polymers. Therefore, to enhance
the water resistance more fundamentally, we completely changed the
approach and employed a hydrophobic polymer. To introduce a hydrophobic
polymer into nacre-like composites, we modified the originally hydrophilic
clay surface with a hydrophobic monomer followed by in situ polymerization;
this led to hydrophobic polymer chains covering the clay plates and
the establishment of a connection between the surfaces of the clay
platelets. Owing to the high aspect ratio of the clay, the clay platelets
were self-aligned to a layered structure. As the clay component, we
chose sodium montmorillonite (MMT), on which sodium cations can be
exchanged using a hydrophobic methacrylate monomer with a long alkyl
chain and organic quaternary ammonium salt group.24 The resultant composite material maintained excellent mechanical
properties even under water. In addition, it exhibited shape stability
in various organic solvents including both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
solvents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
combines a hydrophobic polymer with clays to form a nacre-like composite.

Results
and Discussion
Surface Modification of MMT
MMT
belongs to the smectite
group of clay and is made up of one octahedral alumina sheet sandwiched
between two tetrahedral silica sheets. MMT is ionic and hydrophilic.24 To obtain water-resistant composites with MMT,
MMT was modified by cation-exchange reaction with hydrophobic surface-modifying
agents [i.e., 11-(methacryloyloxy)undecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(UMTA) or 12-(methacryloyloxy)dodecyl 6-(hexanoyloxy)trimethylammonium
bromide (DHTA)] having a methacryloyl group on one end of a long alkyl
chain and a quaternary ammonium group on the other end.24 The chemical structures of the surface modifiers
and a schematic of the MMT surface modification process are shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Chemical structures
of the surface modifiers and a schematic of
the surface modification of MMT.

The amount of the surface modifier on MMT was evaluated using
thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) (Figure 2a). The TGA curve of the pristine MMT shows a drop at <100 °C
which corresponds to the release of adsorbed water. No further weight
loss appears until 635 °C, where a drop is observed owing to
the loss of OH groups and crystallographic-structure collapses in
MMT.25 The TGA curves of the surface modifiers,
UMTA and DHTA, show a weight drop between 200 and 600 °C owing
to the thermal decomposition. The modified clays, MMT–UMTA
and MMT–DHTA, also exhibit considerable weight loss between
200 and 600 °C because of the decomposition of the surface modifier.
From these weight losses, the amounts of DHTA in MMT–DHTA and
UMTA in MMT–UMTA were estimated to be 29.5 and 20.8 wt %, respectively.
For these modified clays, the weight loss at <100 °C is trivial,
showing that the amount of water in the clays is negligible (approximately
1 wt %). The cation-exchange efficiency of the modified clays can
be calculated as26 1  where fCE is the
fraction of the cation that is exchanged by the surface modifier, M is the molecular weight of the surface modifier, S is the percentage weight loss by the decomposition of
the surface modifier during TGA analysis, and C is
the cation-exchange capacity of pristine MMT (115 cmol kg–1). For MMT–UMTA, by applying M = 298.49 g
mol–1 and S = 20.8 wt %, fCE was found to be 0.77. For MMT–DHTA, fCE was found to be 0.85 by applying M = 426.66 g mol–1 and S = 29.5 wt %. The cation-exchange efficiencies for MMT–UMTA
and MMT–DHTA were similar to those of the other surface-modified
MMTs in previous reports.26,27 MMT–DHTA had
larger fCE than MMT–UMTA owing
to the stronger hydrophobic interaction between adjacent modifiers
in MMT–DHTA and MMT–DHTA’s longer alkyl chain.28,29

well as UMTA and DHTA. (b) One-dimensional (1D) X-ray diffraction
(XRD) profiles of MMT, MMT–UMTA, and MMT–DHTA.

The interlayer distance (d spacing) before and
after the surface modification was analyzed by 1D XRD measurements
(Figure 2b). From the
peak position in 1D XRD profiles, the d spacing of
MMT was estimated to be 1.14 nm, which corresponds to the values reported
in previous papers.30−33 By surface modification, the d spacing was enlarged: d = 1.98 nm for MMT–UMTA and 2.40 nm for MMT–DHTA.
This strongly suggests that the surface modifier was successfully
inserted in the interlayers of MMT. The longer alkyl chain of DHTA
results in a larger d spacing in MMT–DHTA
compared to that in MMT–UMTA.32

Attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared (ATR–FTIR)
measurements were performed to further confirm the surface modification
of MMT (Figure S3 and Table S1). Bands associated with both pristine MMT and surface
modifiers were observed in the spectra of MMT–UMTA and MMT–DHTA,
whose assignments are listed in Table S1, referring to previous reports.34−37

The results of TGA, 1D
XRD, and ATR–FTIR measurements clearly
show that the cation-exchange reaction had indeed occurred, and MMT
was successfully modified with UMTA or DHTA.

Fabrication of Nacre-Like
Structure via in Situ Polymerization
MMT–UMTA and
MMT–DHTA are dispersible in dimethylacetamide
(DMA), and the suspensions are stable for over one month. Therefore,
the methacryloyl group of UMTA and DHTA on the surfaces of MMT was
polymerized in DMA. By adding a photoinitiator to the suspension and
irradiating it with UV light, a gel-like deposit (MMT–pUMTA_gel
and MMT–pDHTA_gel) was obtained (Figure S4), which was then dried to yield the final composite films,
MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA.

As the first step of
the characterization of the products, we tried to confirm the polymerization
of the surface modifiers. The reverse ion-exchange technique38−40 was used to cleave the organic molecules from the clay surfaces.
The 1H NMR spectra of the organic residues obtained from
MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA (Figure S5) indicate a lack of C=C double bonds that originally
existed in the surface modifiers, UMTA and DHTA, respectively. In
addition, the spectra are identical to hpUMTA and hpDHTA obtained
by the free-radical polymerization of each monomer. These facts clearly
indicate that UV irradiation induces the polymerization of the surface
modifier and leads to binding of the MMT platelets, thus yielding
gel-like deposits.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
in Figure 3 show the
cross-sectional morphologies
of MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA. Prior to the observation,
the cross-sectional samples were prepared by the freeze-fracture technique,
in which the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and cracked to
obtain fresh cross sections. A nacre-like structure is observed in
both composite films, illustrating the parallel alignment of MMT platelets.

bar of (a) 100 and (b) 10 μm and MMT–pDHTA with the scale
bar of (c) 100 and (d) 10 μm.

Analysis of Structural Evolution During in Situ Polymerization
We further investigated the structural evolution during the fabrication
of MMT–DHTA. First, two-dimensional (2D) XRD measurements were
carried out to clarify the orientation of MMT platelets in the gel-like
deposit (MMT–pDHTA_gel) and the composite film (MMT–pDHTA).
X-rays were emitted in a direction parallel to the plane of each film-like
sample, as illustrated in Figure 4a. Figure 4b,c shows the 2D XRD images of MMT–pDHTA_gel and MMT–pDHTA,
respectively. In both images, the (001) diffraction forms anisotropic
arcs concentrated on the meridian, indicating that the (001) plane
of MMT is oriented parallel to the film surface. Although the orientation
is qualitatively similar, the radial peak position and the azimuthal
width of the (001) diffraction are quantitatively different in MMT–pDHTA_gel
and MMT–pDHTA. The peaks of MMT–pDHTA_gel are situated
at a higher angle than those of MMT–pDHTA, indicating the decrease
of d spacing upon drying of the gel-like deposit.
The change in the d spacing will be discussed quantitatively
using 1D XRD later in this section. The azimuthal width of the diffraction
arcs reflects the orientation degree of the MMT platelets. Figure 4d shows the azimuthal
intensity profile of the (001) diffraction arcs. The peaks of MMT–pDHTA
are sharper than that of MMT–pDHTA_gel, indicating that MMT–pDHTA
had a higher orientation degree than MMT–pDHTA_gel. In fact,
the full-width at half-maximum of the peaks was 39° and 71°
for MMT–pDHTA and MMT–pDHTA_gel, respectively. The incomplete
orientation of MMT platelets in the gel-like deposit, possibly due
to the remaining DMA between the platelets, should improve upon the
complete removal of DMA.

XRD measurements. 2D

direct beam and shadow of the beam stopper are masked with a black
rectangle. (d) Azimuthal intensity profiles of the diffraction arcs
in (b,c). The origin of the azimuthal angle was taken to be the horizontal
axis of the 2D XRD images.

The MMT platelets were self-aligned in the layered structure
during
the formation of the gel-like deposits, possibly because of the high
aspect ratio of MMT, which can make the probability of contact between
the surfaces much larger than that between the sides and that between
the side and the surface. Therefore, in situ polymerization would
bind two clay surfaces, producing an aggregation consisting of alternate
layers of clay platelets and polymer layers. Repeated reactions between
the clay surfaces would increase the aggregation size while maintaining
the plate-like shape and eventually lead to the deposition on the
substrate surface in a manner akin to how a leaf falls to the ground,
that is, while maintaining the parallel orientation of the MMT platelets.
The absence of free monomers or polymers in the reaction system may
also contribute to the formation of the layered structure.

The d spacing of the MMT platelets was evaluated
by 1D XRD. Figure S6 shows 1D XRD profiles
of the surface-modified clays (MMT–UMTA and MMT–DHTA),
gel-like deposits (MMT–pUMTA_gel and MMT–pDHTA_gel),
and composite films (MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA). The positions
of the (001) diffraction peaks and the corresponding d spacings are listed in Table S2. The d spacings of MMT–DHTA, MMT–pDHTA_gel, and
MMT–pDHTA are 2.40, 4.00, and 2.44 nm, respectively. MMT–pDHTA_gel
has the largest d spacing because pDHTA is swollen
by DMA. MMT–DHTA showed the smallest value among these materials
because the alkyl chains of DHTA are arranged obliquely on clay platelets,
allowing efficient nanoscale packing of the molecules.41 The value for MMT–pDHTA is similar to
but slightly larger than that for MMT–DHTA, indicating that
the MMT platelets in MMT–pDHTA were less densely packed compared
to MMT–DHTA, possibly because of the reduced conformational
freedom of the surface modifier by polymerization. A similar tendency
was observed in the d spacings of MMT–UMTA,
MMT–pUMTA_gel, and MMT–pUMTA.

From the above structural
characterization results, we summarize
the possible formation mechanism of the nacre-like structure schematically
in Figure 5. The modified
clay platelets, MMT–UMTA or MMT–DHTA, are initially
dispersed in DMA. The surface modifier, UMTA or DHTA, on the MMT surface
is then polymerized, leading to the aggregation and precipitation
of clay platelets into the gel-like deposit at the bottom of the container.
The high aspect ratio of MMT facilitates the self-alignment of MMT
platelets during the formation of the gel-like deposit. By removing
the remaining DMA, the orientation degree of the MMT platelets increases,
thus yielding the final composite films with a nacre-like structure.

mechanism of self-alignment of MMT platelets by in situ
polymerization.

Shape Stability of Composite
Films in Various Solvents
We investigated the shape stability
of the composite films in various
solvents. We selected water, methanol, acetone, and chloroform as
solvents, to include both hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvents. The
composite films, MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA, were immersed
in each solvent and sonicated for 5 h. Figure 6 shows the photographs of MMT–pDHTA
before and after sonication. Neither film collapse nor significant
volume change was observed in all samples, indicating shape stability.

Figure 6 Photographs
of MMT–pDHTA in water, methanol, acetone, and
chloroform (a) immediately after immersion and (b) after 5 h sonication.

The shape stability of MMT–pDHTA
in hydrophilic solvents
could be ascribed to the hydrophobicity of MMT–DHTA. Although
DHTA is soluble and MMT is dispersible in both water and methanol,
MMT–DHTA is not dispersible in these solvents owing to covering
by a hydrophobic alkyl chain. In hydrophobic solvents such as acetone
and chloroform, the shape stability of MMT–pDHTA is possibly
because of the tight binding between adjacent clay platelets provided
by the polymerization of the surface modifiers. Additionally, the
extremely high loading of rigid MMT (70–80 wt %) may also contribute
to the shape stability of the composites. MMT–pUMTA showed
shape-stability tendencies similar to those of MMT–pDHTA.

Swelling and Mechanical Property of Composite Films in Various
Solvents
We also investigated the water absorption kinetics
and the corresponding change of the mechanical properties of the composites. Figure 7a shows the swelling
ratio of MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA in water as a function
of immersion time. For both MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA,
the swelling ratio gradually increases with time, until it saturates
at 13 and 8 wt %, respectively, after 24 h. Although the composites
mainly consist of originally hydrophilic MMT (∼80 wt % for
MMT–pUMTA and ∼70 wt % for MMT–pDHTA), the equilibrium
swelling ratio of the composites is surprisingly low. This can be
ascribed to the high hydrophobicity of the modified MMT surface owing
to the long alkyl chains in the repeat units of pUMTA and pDHTA. The
swelling ratio of MMT–pUMTA is higher than that of MMT–pDHTA
over the whole range of immersion time, presumably because the hydrophobicity
of pUMTA, which had a shorter alkyl chain, was lower than that of
pDHTA, which had a longer alkyl chain. To confirm the effects of hydrophobicity
of the composite, we further analyzed the change of mechanical properties
upon water absorption.

in
water. The error bars represent the standard deviation. (b) Stress–strain
curves of MMT–pDHTA in the dry state and after immersion in
water for different times.

The tensile properties were investigated for MMT–pDHTA
films
after immersion in water as well as in a dry state. As shown in Figure 7b and summarized
in Table S3, the dry-state Young’s
modulus, tensile strength, and tensile strain were 5.5 ± 0.3
GPa, 96.9 ± 2.9 MPa, and 3.5 ± 0.6%, respectively. The observed
tensile strength of MMT–pDHTA films was similar to that of
natural nacre (80–135 MPa).42,43 Generally,
the high mechanical performance of nacre-like composites is attributed
to the high loading of inorganic substances, layered structure, and
strong organic–inorganic interfacial interaction.7,44,45 MMT–pDHTA satisfies these
criteria: it possesses a high MMT content (70 wt %), layered structure,
and strong ionic interaction between the quaternary ammonium cation
of the polymer and the anionic MMT surface. When immersed in water,
the mechanical properties of MMT–pDHTA deteriorated over time
owing to the moisture-induced reduction of the polymer–clay
interaction.46 However, MMT–pDHTA
exhibited a relatively high mechanical strength and hardness even
after reaching equilibrium swelling under water. After water immersion
for 24 h, the Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and tensile
strain reached 2.9 ± 0.3 GPa, 29.6 ± 1.7 MPa, and 1.4 ±
0.1%, respectively, which did not change any further after immersion
for up to 96 h (Table S3). This stability
clearly shows the excellent water resistance of MMT–pDHTA,
allowing its use even in water.

The swelling behavior and mechanical
properties of the composite
in other solvents were also investigated. Figure S7a shows the swelling ratio of MMT–pDHTA in methanol,
acetone, and chloroform as a function of time. The difference of the
swelling ratio in different solvents can be attributed to the affinity
between pDHTA and the solvent. After immersion for 24 h in these solvents,
the mechanical properties of the samples did deteriorate compared
to the dry state, but the ultimate stress was maintained at above
5 MPa (Figure S7b). As mentioned above,
owing to the covalent bonding between adjacent clay platelets by the
polymerization of surface modifiers, the robust ionic interaction
at the interface, and the extremely high loading of clay, the composite
in this study maintains its mechanical properties in various solvents.

Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated water-resistant nacre-like
composite
films in which the MMT platelets were covered and connected by hydrophobic
polymer chains. We first modified MMT with quaternary ammonium salts
having long alkyl chains with a methacryloyl group at the end, to
endow both reactivity and hydrophobicity. The high aspect ratio of
MMT and the reaction between surface modifiers contributed to the
self-alignment of the MMT platelets into the nacre-like structure
during in situ polymerization. The resulting composite film had an
excellent mechanical strength similar to natural nacre. In addition,
although the composite film was mostly made up of originally hydrophilic
MMT platelets, it exhibited a consistently high mechanical performance
even after reaching equilibrium swelling in water. It also showed
shape stability in various organic solvents including methanol, acetone,
and chloroform. These superior properties of the composites are probably
because of the robust interaction at the interface, tight binding
between MMT platelets by the polymerized surface modifiers, and high
loading of clay (70–80 wt %). Given the high mechanical performance,
water-resistant property, and shape stability in organic solvents,
these composite films can be used in many practical applications.

Experimental
Section
Details on the materials and synthesis of the surface-modifying
agents, UMTA and DHTA, are presented in the Supporting Information.

Surface Modification of MMT
A typical
procedure for
the ion-exchange reaction was employed for the surface modification
of MMT.24 First, 4 g of MMT was added to
300 mL of deionized water and stirred vigorously for 2 days to obtain
a dispersion. A solution of a surface-modifying agent (UMTA or DHTA,
6.0 × 10–3 mol) in 200 mL of deionized water
was added to the dispersion with continuous stirring. The mixture
was stirred for an additional day. The white precipitate formed in
this step was isolated by filtration, followed by dispersion in 500
mL of water by stirring for 30 min. This process was repeated thrice
to remove the excess surface modifier. The washed precipitate was
filtered and dried overnight under vacuum at 40 °C. The product
was then ground to yield a fine powder and stored in a desiccator.
We, hereafter, refer to MMT surface-modified with UMTA and DHTA as
“MMT–UMTA” and “MMT–DHTA”,
respectively.

Fabrication of Composite Films
A
5 wt % dispersion
of the surface-modified clay (MMT–UMTA or MMT–DHTA)
was obtained by vigorous stirring in DMA for 3 h. To this dispersion,
0.5 wt % of 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone was added and stirred
for another 10 min. The mixture was then transferred to a Teflon Petri
dish and irradiated with a UV light (λ = 400–315 nm)
from the top for 24 h, resulting in gel-like deposits (MMT–pUMTA_gel
and MMT–pDHTA_gel, respectively). The Teflon dish was then
heated on a hot plate (40–100 °C, nitrogen atmosphere,
24 h) to remove the solvent, following which the film-like product
was peeled off from the Petri dish. The film was washed by immersion
in methanol for 24 h followed by drying at 60 °C for 5 h. The
resulting stiff and translucent composite films made from MMT–UMTA
and MMT–DHTA were labeled “MMT–pUMTA”
and “MMT–pDHTA”, respectively.

Reverse Ion
Exchange of Composite Films
The organic
component in MMT–pUMTA and MMT–pDHTA was separated from
the clay by reverse ion-exchange reaction.38−40 In 40 mL of
dimethyl sulfoxide, 500 mg of the composite film and 2 g of LiBr were
mixed. The mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 days at 60 °C.
The resultant solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, resulting
in a transparent supernatant and a brownish-yellow sediment. The supernatant
was collected by decantation and poured into 400 mL of tetrahydrofuran
to precipitate the organic component. This organic component was then
filtered with a membrane filter (pore size: 0.45 μm), redissolved
in methanol, and recovered by drying at 40 °C. The organic component
was characterized by 1H NMR in deuterated water.

Synthesis
of Homopolymers
As a reference, homopolymers
of UMTA and DHTA, namely hpUMTA and hpDHTA, were synthesized. For
the synthesis of hpUMTA, a mixture of UMTA (500 mg), 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone
(10 mg), and methanol (10 mL) was irradiated by UV light (λ
= 400–315 nm) overnight. After the reaction, the mixture was
cast, washed with acetone, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven.
hpDHTA was synthesized by a similar method.

Solvent Absorbency Test
of Composite Films
Water, methanol,
acetone, and chloroform were used as the solvents. The weight of the
composite film was measured after immersion into the solvents for
predetermined periods. The swelling ratio was then calculated as 2  where Wd and Ws are the weights of the composite before and
after swelling by the solvent, respectively.

Analyses
1H NMR spectra were acquired using
a JEOL JNM-AL 400 spectrometer (400 MHz, JEOL) in deuterated solvents
at 20 °C. TGA was carried out on a Rigaku TG 8120 instrument
under air atmosphere at a flow rate and heating rate of 50 mL min–1 and 10 K min–1, respectively. 1D
XRD profiles were obtained using a Rigaku RINT-2100 diffractometer,
with a Cu Kα radiation (wavelength λ = 0.15418 nm) and
a scan speed of 2° min–1. The d spacing corresponding to the diffraction angle 2θ was calculated
by the formula d = λ/(2 sin θ). Two-dimensional
XRD images were acquired using the SAXSpoint 2.0 (Anton Paar, Austria)
equipped with a 2D hybrid-pixel detector (EIGER R, Dectris, Switzerland),
again with the Cu Kα radiation. The film samples cut into rectangular
pieces were irradiated in a direction parallel to the film plane.
ATR–FTIR spectra were obtained with a Thermo Scientific Nicolet
iS10 FTIR spectrometer equipped with the Thermo Scientific Smart iTR
with a diamond crystal. SEM images were obtained by using the JCM-6000Plus
(JEOL) microscope. All samples were sputtered with a thin layer of
platinum in an electric field of 30 mA for 30 s under vacuum (<5
Pa) with a JFC-1600 Auto Fine Coater (JEOL) instrument before the
observations. Tensile tests were carried out using the Shimadzu EZ-L
200N tester. The samples were cut into rectangles (3 × 21 mm)
and stored in a desiccator (<20% of RH) for over 3 days or immersed
in water for the required time. A strain rate and gauge length of
1 mm min–1 and 7 mm, respectively, were used under
ambient conditions. The thickness of the specimen was measured with
a constant-pressure thickness gauge in the range of 75–100
μm. For each sample and condition, 4–7 pieces were tested
to confirm the accuracy of the result.
