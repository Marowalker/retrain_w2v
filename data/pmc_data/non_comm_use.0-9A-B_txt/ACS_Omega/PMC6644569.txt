Carbon-encapsulated LiFePO4 (LFP) nanochains were prepared
as a cathode material for lithium batteries by sol–gel method
using citric acid as the carbon source. The prepared LFP/C material
is characterized by structural, morphological, and electrochemical
characterization. LFP/C shows an orthorhombic olivine structure with
“Pnma” space group having an average
particle size of 50 nm. The uniform distribution of LFP particles
coated by the carbon matrix as a nanochain array has been analyzed
by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
analysis of the sample. The electrochemical performance of the LFP/C
nanochain has been analyzed using galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry,
and impedance analysis of the assembled batteries. The sol–gel-derived
LFP/C nanochain exhibits better capacity and electrochemical reversibility
in line with the literature results. The high-temperature conductivity
profile of the sample has been recorded from room temperature to 473
K using impedance analysis of the sample. The transport dynamics have
been analyzed using the dielectric and modulus spectra of the sample.
A maximum conductivity up to 6.74 × 10–4 S
cm–1 has been obtained for the samples at higher
temperature (448 K). The nucleation and growth at higher temperature
act as factors to facilitate the intermediate phase existence in the
LiFePO4 sample in which the phase change that occurs above
400 K gives irreversible electrochemical changes in the LFP/C samples.

Introduction
Lithium metal phosphates
LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, and
Ni) with olivine-type structure have attracted considerable attention
as perspective cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).1,2 Among various alternative cathode materials, lithium iron phosphate
(LFP), discovered by Goodenough in 1990s, is gaining significant attention
because of its low cost, high discharge potential (very flat voltage
curve around 3.4 V), large theoretical capacity (169 mA h/g), good
thermal stability, excellent cycling performance, and high abundance
with environmentally benign and safe nature.1−3

In LFP,
the hexagonal close-packed lattice of oxygen has a two-dimensional
channel network creating potential fast diffusion paths for lithium
ions. The low electronic conductivity on the order of 10–6 to 10–8 S cm–1 and the slow
lithium ion diffusion are the major obstacles preventing the application
of an olivine cathode in a practical battery. An appreciable method
to improve the conductivity is carbon coating around the particles4 and particle size reduction.5 The preparation of LFP and exploring its better electrochemical
performance are quite tedious because the preparation conditions seriously
affect the cycling performance of the same in a large extent. Here,
citric acid-assisted sol–gel process has been used for the
preparation of carbon-encapsulated LFP nanochain interlocks. Here,
citric acid acts as a carbon source which can also prevent the oxidation
of ferrous ions and offers a network chainlike array of LFP with better
electronic conductivity.6 The present method
shows a simple strategy for the effective carbon encapsulation to
improve the capacity of the sample when compared with the other costly
approaches such as the surface modification using graphene, nitrogen
incorporation, and so forth. Even though LiFePO4 is an
active field of current research, the dielectric and modulus analyses
of LiFePO4 have been less explored, especially at higher
temperatures, which would give an in-depth knowledge toward the mechanism
of ionic transport and the relaxation mechanism of the material. It
is a key factor to optimize the ionic conductivity and diffusion mechanism
of LiFePO4 because they dictate the cell capacity and cycle
life. Also, the cathode material should be stable in its structure
and should give a better conductivity profile even at higher temperature
for its application potential especially when it is used in all-solid-state
assembly.7 In one of the previous attempt,
Xu et al. reported an increase in ionic conductivity of LiFePO4 on high-temperature sintering using the Arrhenius plot.8 The study shows that the electronic structure
of LFP mainly supports to the conductivity of the sample by first-principle
calculations. The effect of annealing on the transport properties
of LiFePO4 using a defect chemical model had been reported
by Amin and Maier9 The annealed sample
improves the conductivity of the sample around 4 orders of magnitude
(∼3.1 × 10–6 S cm–1) when compared with the nonannealed (∼6 × 10–10 S cm–1) samples because of the transition from
a defect regime to a region of ionic deficiency by the compensation
of ionic disorder with the electronic defect. Rosaiah et al.10 have investigated the electrochemical properties
of nanocrystalline LiFePO4 prepared by hydrothermal method
from room temperature (RT) to 373 K in which the sample exhibits low
ionic conductivity on the order of 10–7 S cm–1. In LFP material, the lithium insertion or extraction
proceeds at 3.45 V versus lithium metal through a two-phase reaction
between LiFePO4 and FePO4. Other than this,
the existence of intermediate LixFePO4 solid-state solutions has been reported by Delacourt et al.11 The electrochemical behavior of this sample
due to the predicted intermediate phase existence has scarcely been
reported in the literature. The effect of these intermediate phases
and the nature of lithium insertion and extraction at different temperatures
are still challenging issues to be addressed.

The present work
aims to synthesize an LFP nanochain array by citric
acid-assisted sol–gel method. The effective carbon coating
using citric acid as the carbon source has been revealed in the present
study. The major concern of the present approach is electrochemical
characterization and the identification of hopping dynamics and relaxation
processes of the sample at higher temperatures (from RT to 473 K).
The role of temperature on the intermediate phase existence of LFP/C
sample has been addressed in the present study.

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Morphological Characterization
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of the sol–gel-derived LFP/C nanopowder
is shown in Figure 1. LFP/C crystallizes to form an orthorhombic olivine structure in
which the FeO6 octahedra form a layer in the “bc” plane. The adjacent layers are linked by PO4 units leaving some space for the one-dimensional array of
Li atoms along the “a” axis.12 The XRD pattern of LFP/C is assigned as orthorhombic
phase with “Pnma” space group using
the Topas software, when indexed below a maximum deviation of 0.030°
for all indexed lines, which is consistent with the PCPDF no. 81-1173.
The high-intensity background signals originated because of the Fe
content in the sample under Cu Kα radiation. The unit cell parameters
are a = 10.120 Å, b = 6.07
Å, and c = 4.60 Å with a unit cell volume
of 297 Å3. This value is slightly higher than the
values reported in the literature. Zhou et al. predicted more suitable
and self-consistent lattice parameters with a unit cell volume of
301 Å3 taking into account the electron correlation
during the phase change which are in line with these values. Citric
acid used during the preparation not only acts as a solvent for the
formation of sol–gel but also acts as a carbon source for the
formation of LFP/C interface which suppresses the growth of LFP crystals
resulting in a well-arranged nanochain array.13 The absence of any other signals in the XRD pattern indicates that
there are no unwanted impurities, such as Fe2O3 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3, or
any other Fe-related compounds in the prepared LFP/C samples.14 No carbon-related peak was obtained, which shows
that carbon is present in the amorphous phase.15,16

Figure 1 Refined
XRD pattern of the LFP/C sample.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrograph of LFP/C
(Figure 2A,B) shows
the uniform
formation of olivine nanoparticles attached end to end, indicating
the formation of a nanochain array. The LFP/C particles have a spherical
morphology dispersed in carbon matrix that inhibits the growth of
the particles. The spherical aggregates formed from the network structure
of uniformly carbon-coated nanospheres can increase the electronic
conductivity of LFP/C and provide good electronic contact between
the crystallites.17,18 The SEM micrograph shows the
network of aggregated nanochains. The residual carbon imprints are
not much visible in the SEM micrograph, which ensures the uniform
coating. More details about the surface carbon distribution and the
real texture of the particles have been portrayed from the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph of the LFP/C sample.19Figure 2C–F shows the typical TEM micrograph of the LFP/C sample.
The TEM micrograph gives a clear indication of the uniform carbon
coating, preventing the aggregate growth of LFP nanospheres to form
a nanochain interlock array. The nanospheres forming the chain embedded
in the carbon matrix can be visible from the TEM micrographs. The
particles with average size of 50 nm have been uniformly carbon-coated
around the particles and also embedded in outer carbon layers, which
are clearly visible from the TEM micrographs. The Raman spectra analysis
and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS) composition analysis
has been included as the electronic supplementary information (Supporting Information-Figures S1 and S2A,B)
to further verify the structure and carbon content present in the
sample.

sample.

Temperature-Dependent Conductivity
Profile of LFP/C
Figure 3 shows the Z′–Z″ plot of LFP/C
at RT and at different elevated temperatures with Ag|LiFePO4|Ag configuration. The obtained plots were fitted using Z-View software
and the fitting parameters are listed in Table 1. In all figures, the solid line depicts
the original data and the round symbol line represents the fitted
data. The inset picture shows the most fitted equivalent circuits.
The room-temperature (301 K) Nyquist plot (Figure 3a) shows distinct grain and grain boundary
regions in the sample, which have been resolved by fitting the plot
using a suitable equivalent model.20,21 In the equivalent
circuit (Figure 3h),
the block containing resistance (R) and the constant
phase element (CPE) represents one semicircle. The grain and grain
boundary effect has been resolved from the capacitance value provided
by the CPE obtained after fitting. The grain component usually bears
a capacitance value in the range of 10–12 to 10–14 F and the grain boundary in the range of 10–11 to 10–10 F. From the value of
the capacitance, the grain and grain boundaries have been differentiated.
The conductivity of the samples (grain and grain boundary conductivities)
has been calculated by 1   2  where, d is thickness of
the pellet, S is the area of the pellet, σg is the grain conductivity, σgb is the grain
boundary conductivity, Rg is the grain
resistance, and Rgb is the grain boundary
resistance.

Here, uniform
conditions are followed for the sample to measure
the conductivity and the high-temperature features were measured from
the same sample. The conductivity of the pellet has been measured
by considering it as a disc and the thickness of the pellet as the
length of the disc. The bulk conductivity of the sample is 1.36 ×
10–4 S cm–1 at RT. The total conductivity
of the sample is found to be 5.02 × 10–5 S
cm–1 which is an order of magnitude lesser when
compared with the bulk conductivity. At 323 K (Figure 3b), the distinct grain and grain boundary
regions are not visible and the equivalent circuit differentiates
the grain and grain boundary resistance. The conductivity at the grain
region is decreased at 323 K, which may be assumed due to the increase
in unit cell volume at elevated temperatures. However, the total conductivity
(8.46 × 10–5 S cm–1) of the
sample is found to be improved.

At higher temperatures, the
grain and grain boundary regions are
not differentiated, which makes the difference in the equivalent circuit
model of the samples at elevated temperatures. As temperature increases,
the intercept point on the real axis shifts toward the origin, indicating
the decrease in the total resistance of the material. The resistance
decreases up to 79 Ω, increasing the conductivity up to 6.74
× 10–4 S cm–1 at 448 K (175
°C). The increase in conductivity at high temperature may be
attributed to the hopping mechanism of thermally activated charge
carriers.22 After the identification of
LFP as a better cathode material for LIBs by Goodenough et al.,23 in 2001, Prosini et al. reported that the addition
of fine particles of carbon black during the synthesis of LiFePO4 can greatly improve the electrochemical performance. The
composite material so obtained is conductive and no additional carbon
black needs to be added during the electrode preparation. The capacity
seems to be increased with an increase in temperature.24 The pioneering work on LFP carried out by Armand
et al. showed that LiFePO4 with carbon coating can achieve
better capacity. The study explains the method of heating to deposit
the conductive carbon coating on the LFP particles which improves
the rate and capacity of the material. After this work, the LFP material
as a green cathode material for LIBs became an important candidate
for the scientific world.25 After that,
many of the researchers proved the importance of carbon coating on
LFP materials. The conductivity of the noncarbon-coated sample is
only at the range of 10–7 to 10–9 S cm–1.26 The present
sample has been obtained with conductivity in the range of 10–5 to 10–4 S cm–1, which clearly shows the effect of uniform carbon encapsulation
on the LFP particles. Even though an appreciable increase in the ionic
conductivity occurs with the rise in annealing temperature, an inductive
loop appeared in the low-frequency region, which may be related to
some phase transformation that occurs at higher temperatures.27 The inductive loop at the lower-frequency end
occurs because of the grain boundary nucleation and growth at higher
temperatures.28 The existence of LiFePO4 intermediates has been thoroughly investigated by different
authors.29−32 Delacourt et al. have reported the temperature-assisted XRD pattern
of LiFePO4 which clearly suggests a phase change in the
range of temperatures between 423 and 473 K.11 This phase change gives no signature in its differential scanning
calorimetry curve but originates from the coexistence of different
stable LixFePO4 phases as suggested
by Zhou et al.29,30 This can be correlated with the
higher-temperature inductive loop formation that occurs in the LFP
sample. This inductive loop suggests the possibility of accumulation
of the charge carriers near the contact electrode, which may lead
to the formation of some resistive interface when coupled with the
electrolytes during battery formation. The present study explores
that the nucleation and growth at higher temperature act as a factor
which facilitate the intermediate phase existence in LiFePO4 as suggested by the first-principle calculations of Zhou et al.,
in which the phase change that occurs above 400 K gives irreversible
electrochemical changes in the LFP/C samples. After 448 K, the conductivity
plot does not show the regular behavior, which clearly establishes
that the intermediate phase transitions has a key role in the anomalous
high-temperature electrochemical behavior of the olivine-type LiFePO4 sample.

Arrhenius Plot
The Arrhenius plot
(Figure 4a) [represented
as: log(σ)
at different temperatures vs 1000/T] exhibits two
portions: low-temperature region with low activation energy (0.44
eV) and high-temperature region with high activation energy (1.57
eV). The low-temperature linear portion suggests that the sample adheres
to the Arrhenius behavior up to 373 K. The exponential growth above
373 K reveals the requirement of higher activation for the high-temperature
electrochemical processes. The activation energy of the sample has
been calculated using the Arrhenius equation 3  where σ0 is the pre-exponential
factor, T is the absolute temperature, Ea is the activation energy of conduction, and k is the Boltzman constant. According to the Nernst–Einstein
relationship, the ionic conductivity 4  where, ϑ0′ is the attempt frequency, Ze is the charge of a
mobile ion (in the case of Li+, Z = 1),
“d” is the hopping distance of the
ion, N is the number density of mobile ions, and
“f” is the correlation factor (considered
as 1 in most cases). Comparing eqs 3 and 4, the pre-exponential factor
is connected with the hopping distance, number density, and attempt
frequency of mobile ions,33 which in turn
are influenced by the annealing process. Hence, the increase of pre-exponential
factor should be ascribed to the increase of the ionic hopping distance
(d), variations in the number density, and the attempt
frequency with the rise of annealing temperature. The sharp increase
in activation energy after 423 K is due to the inductive loop formation
as verified from the Nyquist plots.

spectra (b) of the LFP/C
sample.

Conductivity Spectra
The nature of conduction and the
mechanism of hopping of the charge carriers/ions at different temperatures
have been divulged by the conductivity spectra. The conductance spectra
at different temperatures have been depicted in Figure 4b. The conductivity spectra consist of two
regions: intermediate plateau and high-temperature dispersion regions.34,35 In the present sample, the frequency-independent plateau region
is more prominent. The width of the plateau region increases with
the increase in temperature. The ionic relaxation process initiates
at a frequency called characteristic frequency (ωs), after which the transition of long-range to short-range hopping
mechanism occurs. With an increase in temperature, the characteristic
frequency ωs also increases with a shift to the higher-frequency
region. The mechanism of conductivity relaxation is in line with the
Jonscher’s power law.36

The
increase in the width of the plateau region with the increase in temperature
points that the long-range hopping mechanism inputs more share to
the total conductivity of the sample. The dc conductivity (σdc) (Table 2) has been calculated by extrapolating the conductivity spectra to
the Y axis. The hopping rate (ωp = 2σdc) also increases with increase in temperature
of the sample.

Dielectric Analysis
The real part of dielectric permittivity
(ε′)37 with respect to the
frequency has been depicted in Figure 5a. Generally, the dielectric constant decreases with
increase in frequency and gets saturated at high frequencies. The
fractional increase that occurs in the sample results in an increase
in the value of dielectric constant. The accumulation of charge carriers
near the electrode results in an initial hike in the dielectric spectra
at the lower-frequency region. The increase in dielectric constant
results from the increase in the charge carrier concentration which
in turn increases the conductivity of the sample.

Figure 5 Real (a) and imaginary
(b) part of dielectric spectra for the LFP/C
sample at different temperatures.

At higher frequencies, a decrease in the value of the dielectric
constant occurs due to the periodic reversal of the applied field
which is so high that there is no further ion diffusion in the field
direction. Hence, the polarization-proliferated charge accumulation
decreases, leading to the decrease in the value of dielectric constant
at the higher frequency region. At RT, the polarization effect is
more when compared with the same at elevated temperature, which may
be the reason for the increase in the dielectric value of 303 and
323 K when compared with other high temperatures. Also, the dielectric
constant increases with temperature as the orientation is facilitated
due to the increase in temperature, which in turn increases the effective
dipole.

The dielectric loss spectra are shown in Figure 5b. Dielectric loss is the energy
dissipated
and includes the comprehensive contribution from ionic transport and
the polarization of charges or a dipole. The increase in the dielectric
loss at lower frequencies arises due to free charge motion that occurs
within the material. These values, which arise from the free charge
buildup in the interface between the material and electrode, do not
contribute to the bulk dielectric processes but lead to the conductivity
relaxation process. The relationship between the conductivity σ
and dielectric loss factor ε″ can be given by 5  σ and ε″ are strongly temperature-dependent
and increase with increase in temperature.

The conductivity
loss plots generally divulge into two prominent
relaxation processes: the lower-frequency α-relaxation peak
and high-frequency β-relaxation peak. The α-relaxation
peak pronounced at higher temperature may be caused by the movement
of main-chain dipole segments and the β-relaxation peak at higher
frequencies may be caused by the side group dipoles and the nearest
part of the backbone.38,39 In the present study, the absence
of multiple dielectric loss peaks suggests the occurrence of the single
relaxation process. The increase in ε′ at the lower-frequency
window as temperature increases is caused by the polarizability that
arises due to multiple components such as electronic, ionic, and interfacial
orientation of ions.

Electrical Modulus Analysis
The
complex electric modulus
spectrum represents the measure of the distribution of ion energies
or configurations in the structure describing the electrical relaxation
and macroscopic properties of the materials.19,40,41Figure 6a,b represents the frequency dependence of M′(ω) and M″(ω)
at different temperatures.

Figure 6 Real (a) and imaginary (b) part of frequency-dependant
modulus
spectra of the LFP/C sample at different temperatures (the inset in Figure 6b shows the magnified
image to indicate the shift in the peak position).

In the M′ versus log(ω)
plot, M′ at the lower-frequency region reaches
zero, suggesting
the negligible contribution from electrode polarization.42−44 The higher value of M′ suggests the relaxation
process that occurs at the higher-frequency region. The pattern at
the higher-frequency side did not show a uniform order of increase
or decrease with temperature, pointing that the relaxation is not
fully temperature-dependant but the local dispersion-based relaxation
also contributes to the relaxation process. The effect of temperature
in the relaxation process will be obtained from the analysis of the
imaginary part of modulus value at different frequency windows. The M″ versus log(ω) plot is shown in Figure 6b and the inset shows
the magnified image of the lower-frequency region of the sample at
different temperatures. The M″ versus log(ω)
plot gives the peak relaxation frequency (fmax) from which the relaxation time (τ) can be intended. The broad
nature of the peak suggests that the relaxation time is not single-valued
but disseminated continuously around the mean value.45 The peak relaxation frequency (fmax) and the relaxation time (τ) are tabulated in Table 3. The increase in temperature
results in a shift in the plot toward the higher-frequency region,
but at higher temperatures (423 and 448 K) where the inductive effect
is more prominent (as shown from the Nyquist plot), does not show
any shift in the peak position. This can be correlated with the occurrence
of intermediate phase which explains the deviation of electrochemical
behaviors. The M″/Mmax″ versus log(ω) (Figure 7) plot furnishes the effect of temperature
in the relaxation phenomena. The plot gives an overlapping peak at
higher-frequency windows suggesting that the conductivity relaxation
mechanism is more or less temperature independent, suggesting the
prominent dispersion-related conductivity relaxation at the higher-frequency
window. The dispersive conductivity can be explained with respect
to the predicted diffusion-controlled relaxation model.46 The M″/Mmax″ versus log(ω) plot shows
that the broadness of the curve is independent of the temperature.47 Rosaiah et al.10 studied
the electrochemical properties of LFP materials in the frequency range
1 Hz to 1 MHz in which the imaginary part of the modulus spectra exhibits
multiple energy loss at higher temperatures. However, in the present
study, the LFP/C sample prepared by citric acid-assisted sol–gel
method exhibits single relaxation at the higher-frequency window.
The almost constant full width half-maximum value (“β”)
would also imply that the relaxation process is temperature independent.
The frequency at which the intersection occurs with the real axis,
the frequency at which the relaxation effects begin, and the peak
frequency of M″ plot shift toward the higher-frequency
side with an increase in temperature. The M″/Mmax″ versus log(ω) plot
at 423 and 448 K does not exhibit an overlapping peak at a high-frequency
window, which also substantiates the intermediate phase change-related
accumulation of charge carriers.

LFP/C sample at different temperatures.

Electrochemical Characterization of the Sample
Galvanostatic
Studies
Figure 8a shows the galvanostatic cycling results
of the sol–gel-derived LFP/C nanochain. The sample has been
cycled within the potential range of 2.5–4.5 V with a current
density of 30 mA g–1 after the battery fabrication.
Charge discharge profiles of the selected cycles (at 30 mA g–1) have been included for clarity. The inset picture shows the magnified
image of the end portion of the discharge profile. The first cycle
sweeps a maximum charge capacity of 161 mA h/g, which is followed
by the discharge capacity of 154 mA h/g at 30 mA g–1. After the initial cycles, the stable capacity around 144 mA h/g
has been retained by the sample in the proceeding cycles. The LFP/C
nanochain shows a discharge capacity of 143 mA h/g after 50 cycles.
To elucidate the stable performance of the assembled cell, the same
cell after sweeping 50 cycles has been cycled at different current
rates. The capacity versus cycle plots at different current densities
of 30 and 60 mA g–1, 1 C (170 mA g–1), and 3 C (510 mA g–1) have been portrayed in Figure 8b. The figure shows
a stable charge discharge profile with minimum capacity fading.48−50 The sample exhibits a capacity fading less than 1% between 5th and
50th cycles in all current rates, clearly establishing the better
stability of the sample due to the uniform carbon encapsulation around
the nano-LFP/C by simple sol–gel route. The stable charge–discharge
cycles obtained even at higher current rate result from the uniform
carbon-encapsulated nanochain morphology of the sample.

Cyclic Voltammetry Studies
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
studies have been carried out at different scan rates for better understanding
toward the intercalation–deintercalation of Li ions in the
sol–gel-derived LFP/C nanochains. Figure 8c shows the CV plots of the sample at different
scan rates (0.1, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mV/s). The inset picture shows the
individual plot at 0.1 mV/s. The CV plot at 0.1 mV/s scan rate shows
the oxidation peak at 3.51 V and the corresponding reduction peak
at 3.41 V. At higher scan speed, the oxidation potential shifts to
the higher value, whereas the reduction potential shifts to the lower
value with an increase in peak current, which is in accordance with
the Randles–Sevcik relation.49 In
a slow voltage scan rate, the diffusion layer will grow much farther
from the electrode in comparison to a fast scan which reduces the
current value. The CV parameters are tabulated in Table 4. For a perfect reversible system,
the anodic and cathodic peak currents should have the same magnitude.51 The lower value for the present LFP (i.e., ic/ia not equal to
1) may be due to the fact that the Li ion undergoes a two-phase process
during charge and discharge in which Li ions are most likely transported
through regions with FePO4 or LiFePO4.23,52 This difference in electrochemical environments10 for Li movement may account for the difference in the magnitude
of the peak current. The intercalation–deintercalation peak
current is linearly related to the square root of scan rate (Figure 8b), establishing
the reversible nature of the prepared electrodes. The CV plots and
the cycling results verify the better electrochemical property of
the sol–gel-derived carbon-encapsulated LFP nanochains, which
is in line with different literature reports.48,49,53,54

Impedance Analysis
Figure 9 shows the
impedance plot of the assembled
cell before and after cycling. The impedance data of the full cell
have been fitted using Z-View software. The circle line shows the
original data and solid line shows the most fitted curve. The fresh
cell impedance plot exhibits a single semicircle with combined surface
film and charge-transfer resistance. The fresh cell exhibits an electrolyte
dissociation resistance of 2.45 Ω, which is found to be vanished
in the impedance plot recorded after 50 cycles. The fresh cell exhibits
the combined surface film and charge-transfer resistance of 39.93
Ω. The impedance plot recorded after cycling shows two semicircles,
which is evident from the equivalent circuit model used for fitting
(inset Figure 9). After
cycling, the surface film resistance has been resolved from the charge-transfer
component.48,50,55 The sample exhibits the surface film resistance of 3.78 Ω
and a charge-transfer resistance of 13.42 Ω. The lower impedance
value substantiates the better performance of carbon-encapsulated
nanochains prepared by sol–gel method.

Conclusions
The
sol–gel-derived LFP/C nanochains show orthorhombic structure
with an average particle size of 50 nm. The surface carbon-dispersed
spherical particles interconnected as a nanochain array have been
established by SEM and TEM characterization of the sample. The high-temperature
conductivity analysis of the LFP/C nanochain array shows an increase
in the value of conductivity with an increase in temperature. The
nucleation and growth at higher temperature act as a factor which
facilitate the intermediate phase existence in the LiFePO4 sample in which the phase change that occurs above 400 K gives irreversible
electrochemical changes in the LFP/C samples. The difference in the
activation energy calculated from the Arrhenius plot reveals that
the energy barrier for the charge carriers for an activated process
is higher at higher temperatures above 373 K. The conductivity spectra
exhibit a long-range plateau region, suggesting that a long-range
ionic movement contributes to the major share in conductivity. The
dielectric constant increases with increase in temperature because
of the effective orientation of the dipoles at elevated temperatures.
The absence of multiple dielectric loss peaks suggests the occurrence
of single relaxation process in the LFP/C sample. The conductivity
relaxation mechanism is more or less temperature independent, suggesting
the prominent dispersion-related conductivity relaxation at the higher-frequency
window. The frequency at which the intersection occurs with real axis,
the frequency at which the relaxation effects begin, and the peak
frequency of M″ plot shift toward the higher-frequency
side with an increase in temperature. The M″/Mmax″ versus log(ω) plot
at 423 and 448 K does not exhibit an overlapping peak at the high-frequency
window, which also substantiates the intermediate phase change-related
accumulation of charge carriers at higher temperatures. The better
electrochemical performance of the sample has been derived from the
uniform carbon encapsulation around the nanoparticles to form a nanochain
array by the facile sol–gel method.

Experimental Section
Preparation
The LFP/C cathode material has prepared
by modified sol–gel method. Stoichiometric amounts of ferrous
oxalate dihydrate (AR-99%, Aldrich) (9 g) and lithium nitrate (AR-99.5%,
Aldrich) (3.45 g) were dissolved in 1 M nitric acid solution (30 mL)
(AR-99.5%, Himedia), into which 10 mL of citric acid solution (AR-99.5%,
Himedia) (66 wt %) was added dropwise with continuous stirring. A
saturated solution of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (AR-99.5%, Aldrich)
(5 mL, 53 wt %) was then added to the mixture. The mixture was heated
gently with continuous stirring for 2 h. The resulting gel precursor
was dried in a tubular furnace for 5 days at 100 °C. The 5 days
have been used for the complete removal of NH3 from the
intermediate polymer gel matrix produced after the gel formation.
This step has been performed at low temperature to reduce the particle
size to a larger extent by the slow removal of NH3 from
the precursor, which is necessary to maintain the preferred morphology
of the sample. Then, the precursor was further calcined at 700 °C
in the argon atmosphere for 2 h. The final product was brownish-black
in color. The calcinated powder was dried and pelletized using the
pelletizer by applying a uniform pressure of 16 kN/m2.

Characterization
The prepared LFP/C nanopowder is structurally
characterized by the powder XRD technique (XRD-Shimazdu-6000) using
a Cu Kα radiation source. The morphological characterization
of the samples has been carried out using SEM (JEOL-JSM 6390) and
TEM (JEOL JEM-3010; 300 kV) analysis. The electrical characterization
of the pellets has been carried out by a complex impedance spectrometer
(HIOKI LCR 3532-50; frequency range: 2 Hz to 5 MHz) using the silver
paste as the contact electrode on either side with Ag|LiFePO4|Ag configuration from RT to 175 °C to analyze the high-temperature
profile of the sample.

Electrochemical studies have been carried
out with a 2016 type of coin cell assembly. The electrodes were fabricated
with the active material LFP/C, binder (Kynar 2801) and Super P conductive
carbon black in the weight ratio of 70:15:15 using N-methylpyrrolidone as a solvent to the binder. Etched Al-foil (20
mm) has been used as the current collector. Lithium metal foil has
been used as the negative electrode (anode) and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate + dimethyl carbonate (1:1 volume ratio) (Merck,
Selectipur LP40) has been used as the electrolyte. Charge–discharge
cycling was carried out at an ambient temperature using a Bitrode
battery tester (model, MCV16-0.5, USA). CV studies were carried out
at different scan rates using the Solatron, 1470 battery test unit.
Impedance spectroscopy was carried out with a Solartron impedance/gain-phase
analyzer (model SI 1255) coupled with a potentiostat (SI 1268). The
frequency was varied from 0.18 MHz to 3 mHz with an alternating current
signal amplitude of 10 mV.
