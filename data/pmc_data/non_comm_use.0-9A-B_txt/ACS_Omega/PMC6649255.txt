Nanocellulose, as a biobased versatile
nanomaterial that can be
derived with tailorable surface functionalities, dimensions, and morphologies,
has considerable implications for modifying the rheology, mechanical
reinforcement, and influencing the carbonization efficiency in the
production of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fibers. Herein,
we report the influence of three different nanocellulose types, varying
in the derivatization method, source, and aspect ratio, on the mechanical
properties and thermal transformations of solution-spun PAN/nanocellulose
nanocomposite fibers into carbon fibers. The incorporation of 0.1
wt % nanocellulose into solution-spun PAN fibers led to a 7–19%
increase in tensile modulus and 0–27% increase in tensile strength in the solution-spun
fibers, compared to a control PAN fiber. These improvements varied
depending on the nanocellulose type. After low-temperature carbonization
at 1200 °C, improvements in the mechanical properties of the
nanocellulose-reinforced carbon fibers, compared with a PAN fiber,
were also observed. In contrast to the precursor fibers, the improvement
% in the carbonized fibers was found to be dependent on the nanocellulose
morphology and was linearly correlated with increasing aspect ratio
of nanocellulose. For example, in carbon fibers with a cotton-derived
low-aspect-ratio cellulose nanocrystal and spinifex-derived high-aspect-ratio
CNC and nanofiber, up to 4, 87, and 172% improvements in tensile moduli
were observed, respectively. Due to the processing methods used, the
nanocellulose aspect ratio and crystallinity are inversely related,
and as such, the increase in the carbon fiber mechanical properties
was also related to a decrease in crystallinity of the nanocellulose
reinforcers. Raman spectra and electron microscopy analysis suggest
that mechanical improvement after carbonization is due to internal
reinforcement by highly ordered regions surrounding the carbonized
nanocellulose, within the turbostratic carbon fibers.

Introduction
The reinforcement of
the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor fiber
using nanoadditives offers a unique strategy to improve the mechanical
performance of a carbon fiber. Due to their high tensile modulus,
single-wall carbon nanotubes have been investigated as a reinforcer;1−4 however, some of the drawbacks of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)
include high cost of production (up to $750/g5) and dispersion challenges. Nanocellulose as a versatile nanomaterial
with tailorable surface functionalities, dimensions, and morphologies
can offer a potentially low-cost, biobased alternative reinforcer
for PAN-based carbon fibers.6,7 Nanocellulose can be
obtained with different surface chemistries, morphologies, and property
profiles depending on the source, isolation methods, and processing
conditions. Mostly, the rodlike or ricelike cellulose nanocrystals
(CNCs) of low aspect ratio (10–50) and having a diameter in
the range of 10–100 nm are isolated through common pulping
and acid hydrolysis, oxidation, enzymatic treatment, or high-intensity
ultrasonic treatments,8,9 while the filament-like cellulose
nanofibers (CNFs) of high aspect ratios (>100) are extracted from
mild chemical pretreatments followed by mechanical shearing methods
(high-pressure homogenization, milling, ultrasonication, microfluidization,
double disc grinding, etc.).10−12 The individual differences in
different nanocellulose types are particularly relevant in the context
of polymer composites where highly stiff, high-aspect-ratio nanomaterials
provide the greatest mechanical reinforcement.8,9 Therefore,
when comparing cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibers
(CNFs), a balance between these variables is crucial, since CNCs tend
to be more rigid, while CNF have a higher aspect ratio.10−12 Furthermore, given the inherently high oxygen content of nanocellulose
(10 oxygen atoms per cellulose monomer) and the fact that most cellulose
pulp grades contain varying proportions of weak carboxylate groups,13 the oxygen released from cellulose pyrolysis14 in a nanocellulose-reinforced PAN fiber may
potentially influence the bulk oxidation and nitrile cyclization reactions
during PAN thermal stabilization.15 This
is because for carbon fiber-grade PAN fibers, oxygen-rich acidic co-monomers
are often incorporated to control the rate of stabilization reactions.16,17 With surface functionalization chemistry such as TEMPO oxidation18 and sulfurization reactions,19,20 the nanocellulose surface can be modified to increase the oxygen
content or to incorporate heat-controlled acid catalysts.

From
a fiber-spinning standpoint, there are numerous existing examples
of nanocellulose wet-spun directly from concentrated hydrogels,21,22 as well as wet-spun polymer composite fibers utilizing the reinforcing
additives at lower amounts typically between 1 and 10%.23−25 For instance, Akira Isogai’s group wet-spun a poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) composite with an addition of 1 wt % TEMPO-oxidized
CNF, which yielded a fiber with a tensile modulus of 6 GPa, which
increased to 57 GPa with stretching.24 The
stiffening effects were attributed to the nanoreinforcement of the
polymer matrix by the nanofibers facilitated by (1) the homogeneous
dispersion of the individualized nanofibers without aggregation due
to its high surface charge and (2) intermolecular compatibility between
the TEMPO-oxidized CNF and the amorphous PVA matrix. Such effects
would similarly be expected for PAN-based solution-spun fibers.

In PAN-based composite fibers containing cellulose nanocrystals
(CNCs), some studies have also demonstrated improvements in the tensile
properties of the reinforced precursor fiber,26,27 from which Park et al. also demonstrated improvements in the performance
of the carbon fiber after carbonization.27 A more recent study has even demonstrated that a CNC loading of
up to 40 wt % can be achieved in a PAN/CNC carbon fiber, with mechanical
properties comparable to those of a pure PAN fiber, highlighting the
potential for more biobased carbon fibers.28 However, in all of these cases, the nanocellulose additives were
limited to CNC without surface functionality (besides the natural
cellulose −OH groups) and relatively low aspect ratios (10–40).
This highlights the scope of enhanced reinforcement of PAN fibers
using higher-aspect-ratio nanocelluloses.

Overall, there are
significant differences between the functionalities
and morphologies of different types of nanocellulose additives available,
and to date, no work has been carried out to compare their effects
on carbonization and mechanical performance of PAN-based carbon fibers.
Hence, three different nanocellulose types of varying aspect ratio,
morphology, crystallinity index, and acidic group content produced
through either the mechanical or the typical acid hydrolysis method
are benchmarked in this study, for their effect on carbonization and
the properties of solution-spun PAN-based carbon fibers. For this,
the low-aspect-ratio CNC and higher-aspect-ratio CNC were produced
through common acid hydrolysis (digestion under acidic conditions,
disintegration by ultrasonication and freeze-drying) from cotton and
spinifex grass (Triodia pungens), respectively,
and the highest-aspect-ratio CNF was derived from spinifex grass through
the mechanical method. As a departure from film cast carbon composites,29,30 herein, the wet-spinning technique was selected for a closer representation
of the carbon fiber production process. This required the building
of a custom solution-spinning unit, which is described in the Experimental Section (Figure S1a). Furthermore, to gain a deeper insight into the influence
of nanocellulose on the mechanical and chemical transformations occurring
throughout the heating process, the solution-spun fibers were tracked,
through a scaled-down industrial carbon fiber production line (Figure S1b). These changes were studied as a
function of the properties of the nanocellulose additives after low-temperature
carbonization.

Four different multifilament
fibers were produced by solution-spinning
from the control PAN and the PAN/nanocellulose solutions, each containing
either cotton CNC (c-CNC), spinifex CNC (s-CNC), or spinifex CNF (s-CNF)
at 0.1 wt %. The reinforcement potential of the various nanocellulose
additives in the solution-spun fibers processed with the same conditions
was investigated, and the mechanical properties are summarized in Table 2.

The data indicate that the incorporation of the two types of CNCs
led to an improvement in the modulus and strength (break tension)
compared to the blank precursor fiber. The PAN/s-CNC fiber performed
the best with a modulus improvement of 18% and strength improvement
of 27% over the blank PAN fiber. An explanation for these effects
is that the mechanical reinforcement of the PAN fiber by the nanocellulose
helps dissipate the stress of a load on the fiber.31

Overall, the elongation % of the precursor fibers
decreased by
the incorporation of 0.1% nanocellulose additive and no statistically
significant change in the elongation % was observed among nanocomposite
fibers. With a modulus of 7.0 GPa and strength of 190 MPa, the PAN/s-CNC
fiber also showed better performance than other previously published
solution-spun PAN fiber precursors containing CNC at higher loadings
up to 2 wt %.27 However, it is acknowledged
that these values are still considered low compared to those of typical
commercial-grade solution-spun PAN fibers (tensile modulus: ∼10
GPa, strength: ∼500 MPa32) since
the fiber spinning technique was limited to what was achievable with
our custom-built device (total draw ratio: 3.9) and the fibers were
not drawn postspinning. The fibers were not drawn to maintain consistency
in the four fiber variants, since drawability (stretchability) of
each of them would be different. These values would be expected to
increase upon drawing under suitable conditions with a commercial
fiber spinning unit.

Another consideration for the property
differences between the
precursors, particularly for the performance of the s-CNF (with no
statistical difference in strength or modulus compared with the control
PAN fiber), is the differences in the rheology of the PAN/nanocellulose
solutions. The presence of strong surface charges on the CNCs increased
its flowability in the polymer matrix in a polar solvent by electrostatic
repulsion. This is indicated by the lower viscosity of the PAN/CNC
solutions compared to that of the PAN/CNF solution at lower shear
rates in a 6 wt % PAN solution (Figure 1a). As such, the PAN/CNC solutions will have greater
flowability during the spinning process, potentially leading to more
oriented reinforcers, and higher observed fiber tensile values.

types on PAN rheology and fiber structure.

and (b) 13% PAN solution (the inset shows power law fit), showing
greater non-Newtonian behavior in the PAN/s-CNF solution compared
to the PAN/c-CNC, PAN/s-CNC, and blank PAN solutions. (c) Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves showing the glass-transition (Tg) changes in the different multifilament fibers
after (c) an initial heating cycle and (d) a second heating cycle.

By contrast, the PAN/s-CNF solution
displayed far greater flow
resistance and shear thinning as characterized by a higher initial
viscosity at a low shear rate, followed by a rapid reduction in viscosity
at higher shear. This shear thinning behavior in PAN/s-CNF solutions
was observed in both 6 wt % (Figure 1a) and 13 wt % PAN/DMF solutions (Figure 1b). After fitting the curves
for the 13 wt % solutions to a power law model, only the PAN/s-CNF
solution showed shear thinning behavior where the flow behavior index, n, is below 1 (additional rheological data at 13 wt % is
given in Appendix S3). This behavior is
due to its lack of surface functionality and very high aspect ratio,
which increase the number of fibril entanglements, as well as possible
H-bond and van der Waals interactions with polymer chains.33 At higher shear rates, these fibrils are able
to disentangle and overcome H-bonding forces, which leads to the reduction
in viscosity. This suggests that a greater amount of initial shear
force from the spinning process is required to enable flow-based unidirectional
orientation of the s-CNF compared with the c-CNC and s-CNC along the
axis of the spun fiber at low shear rates (which affects the mechanical
properties of the composite fibers).

The effect of the nanocellulose
types on the thermal transitions
of PAN/nanocellulose nanocomposite fibers was also investigated using
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) through two heating and cooling
cycles between −10 and 160 °C (Figure 1c,d). These data show a higher glass-transition
temperature for all fiber-spun samples (Tg: 122–128 °C) in the first heating cycle compared with
the second heating cycle (Tg: ∼100
°C), which indicates the increased rigidity of the PAN molecular
structure due to the fiber spinning process. In addition to this,
the PAN fibers containing the nanocellulose additives also appear
to have a slightly higher Tg (123–128
°C) compared with the blank PAN fiber (122 °C).

Tracking the
Influence of Different Nanocellulose Types on Spun
Fiber Stabilization
As thermal stabilization is considered
the most critical and energy-intensive step in the carbon fiber manufacturing
process, the effect of the different nanocellulose additives on the
mechanical and chemical changes through the stabilization process
was also monitored. The solution-spun multifilament composite fibers
were thermally stabilized by passing the fibers through a four-oven
system of increasing temperature treatment (233, 245, 255, and 263
°C) under tension. The tensile properties of the various composite
fibers were measured through each zone of the stabilization process
and are shown in Figure 2, in addition to the change in density of the fibers.

Figure 2 Effect of nanocellulose
types on the mechanical properties of the
thermally stabilized solution-spun fibers: (a) elongation, (b) modulus,
(c) break tension (strength), and (d) density. Zone temperatures from
1 to 4 are 233, 245, 255, and 263 °C, respectively. Error bars
represent the standard deviation (n = 25).

Figure 2a shows
a general decrease in elongation for all of the fibers as stabilization
proceeds. For the PAN fiber, the elongation at break decreased rapidly
from 44 to 6% through stabilization and from approximately 21 to 6%
for the composite fibers. As the elongation of the fibers decreased
with immediate exposure to the zone 1 oven, the modulus of all of
the fibers also immediately increased (Figure 2b). Following zone 2–4 treatment,
the modulus of the PAN fibers remained relatively constant, whereas
the modulus of the composite fibers dropped by approximately ∼2
GPa. The total modulus change from the precursor fiber to zone 4 stabilized
fiber for each fiber was a 33, 18, 18, and 21% increase for the PAN,
c-CNC, s-CNC, and s-CNF fibers, respectively. Figure 2c indicates that the strength of the fibers
was largely unchanged through the entire process.

Both the initial
reduction in elongation and increase in modulus
have been attributed to the early formation of rigid interchain cyclic
structures, as indicated by the FTIR data (Figure 3a,b). PAN is typically characterized by a
nitrile absorption band at 2242 cm–1 due to a stretching
mode about the triple bond. The intensity of this band drops through
stabilization, as the nitriles react with adjacent groups to form
cyclic carbon structures. These conjugated groups are characterized
by an increase in the C=C and C=N bands at 1590 cm–1. From this information, the extent of cyclization
(EOC) was calculated from the ratio of peak intensities of conjugated
carbon and nitrile groups. This gives an indication of the progress
of stabilization, and these data are summarized below in Figure 3b.

Figure 3 Effect of nanocellulose
types on the chemical properties of the
thermally stabilized solution-spun fibers. (a) Example FTIR spectra
for the s-CNC fiber showing the increasing aromatic peak with decreasing
nitrile through stabilization and (b) extent of cyclization (EOC)
for each fiber through stabilization. Error bars are the standard
deviation (n = 3). (c) Example DSC curves showing
the change in reaction exotherms for the s-CNC fiber through stabilization
and (d) the change in enthalpy for each fiber through stabilization.
Error bars represent the standard deviation (n =
3).

Generally, the histogram shows
a linearly increasing cyclization
reaction for each of the different fibers from heating zones 1 to
4. The data shows a reduced EOC value for the PAN/nanocellulose fibers
compared to the PAN fiber (6–10% cf. 12% for PAN) after passing
through zone 1. However, after further processing of the fibers through
zones 2 and 3, the rate of cyclization for the nanocellulose composite
fibers increased, leading to all of the fibers being fully stabilized
after passing through zone 4 with the same EOC of approximately ∼70%.
This suggests that even at a small loading of 0.1 wt % nanocellulose,
it is found to be involved in reducing the rate of the initial cyclization
reactions at lower stabilization temperatures (zone 1, 233 °C).
Furthermore, this effect appears to be independent of the type or
aspect ratio of the nanocellulose. This early inhibitive effect is
similar to that observed for the stabilization of PAN fibers with
SWCNTs,4 where steric interference of cyclization
along the polymer backbone during the initial heating phases of stabilization
has been observed. However, upon continued heat treatment, the remaining
unreacted nitriles on the chain continue to cyclize. This information
may have important implications for controlling and slowing the initial
cyclization rate, which is typically the function of acidic co-monomers
in PAN beneficial for preventing the uncontrolled overheating of the
fiber.34

The density of all of the
fibers also showed significant increases
with stabilization treatment, particularly after zone 3 (Figure 3d). This late-stage
increase in density is typical for the stabilization of PAN fibers,
where sufficiently stabilized fibers have previously been reported
to have mass densities fall in the range between 1.34 and 1.39.35 This rapid increase in density at higher stabilization
temperatures has been previously implicated with increased oxygen
uptake and exothermic oxidation reactions in the fiber.35,36 The DSC data (Figure 3c,d) also suggests that a greater amount of heat is released due
to an exothermic reaction following zone 3, as shown by a sudden and
steeper drop in enthalpy for the zone 4 fibers. This suggests that
the oxidation reactions occur at higher temperatures during late-stage
stabilization, while cyclization begins immediately at zone 1. The
notion that the transformation of nitriles into cyclic structures
is a kinetic prerequisite for the initiation of rapid oxygen uptake
and fiber oxidation has also been proposed by other authors in PAN
fiber kinetic studies.37,38 This is particularly interesting
given that the nanocellulose composite fibers showed higher densification
after zone 3–4 heat treatment compared to the neat PAN fiber.
Accordingly, this may be related to the presence of oxygen in cellulose
and its release by degradation during stabilization heating.39

Effect of Nanocellulose Aspect Ratio on Carbon
Fiber Properties
Figure 4a,b shows
the mechanical properties of each of the different composite carbon
fibers after carbonization at 1200 °C, with the representative
stress–strain curves given in Figure S7. With tensile moduli of 71.1 and 103.4 GPa, stiffening effects were
observed in both the s-CNC and s-CNF reinforced carbon fibers, respectively,
compared to the control PAN fiber (38.0 GPa). This corresponds to
a respective 1.9 and 2.7 times increase in the modulus over the control
PAN fiber, increasing with the increasing aspect ratio of the nanocellulose.
The c-CNC reinforced carbon fiber surprisingly only showed marginal
improvements in the tensile modulus (39.5 GPa) compared to the control,
which was not statistically significant. Improvements in the tensile
strength of the carbon fibers, on the other hand, trended up consistently
with the increasing aspect ratio of the nanocellulose incorporated
(PAN: 187 MPa, c-CNC: 307 MPa, s-CNC: 383 MPa, s-CNF: 593 MPa). On
the other hand, the strains at break for all of the carbon fibers
were all in a similar range (0.9–1.2%), irrespective of the
presence or absence of nanocellulose.

Figure 4 Effect of nanocellulose types on the mechanical
and structural
properties of the carbonized solution-spun fibers: (a) tensile modulus
and (b) tensile strength. Error bars represent the standard deviation
(n = 15). (c) Raman spectra and (d) Raman D/G ratios
(error bars are standard deviation, n = 4) of the
“as-obtained” carbon fiber samples indicating formation
of carbon structure.

The general improvement in the mechanical performance of
the carbon
fibers is attributed to an enhancement in the formation of a more
ordered microstructure in the carbon fibers. Evidence for this can
be seen by the change in the D/G ratio of the D and G bands in the
Raman spectra for both the as-obtained carbon fiber samples (Figure 4c,d) and crushed
samples (Figure S8). The D-band at ∼1340
cm–1 corresponds with sp3 disordered
carbon structures, while the G-band located at ∼1590 cm–1 is related to a stretching mode of the sp2-hybridized carbon. The D/G ratio is thus a useful indicator for
the carbon microstructure and crystalline properties, which, in this
case, shows that a drop in the Raman D/G ratio is observed with the
increasing aspect ratio of the nanocellulose additive (Figure 4d).

This suggests that
the carbon fibers that contain increasingly
higher-aspect-ratio nanocellulose have an increased proportion of
structurally ordered carbon than disordered carbon. However, these
data show that only the highest-aspect-ratio s-CNF composite carbon
fiber demonstrated a significant improvement in the carbon properties
compared to the control PAN fiber without any additive. These results
are also corroborated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of each composite carbon fiber, which show the increasing formation
of ordered carbon layers in the nanocellulose composite carbon fibers,
while the neat PAN carbon fiber retained a largely disordered structure
(Figure 5). Generally,
the size and quantity of a turbostratic structure in the composite
fibers increased with the nanocellulose aspect ratio. The PAN/c-CNC
fiber showed a largely disordered structure similar to the PAN standard
fiber, though some turbostratic ordering is visible at the edges of
the carbon material (d-spacing ∼0.34 nm),
while the PAN/s-CNC fiber images showed an increasing turbostratic
carbon structure throughout the sample with variable d-spacing (0.34–0.38 nm). Finally, the PAN/s-CNF fiber images
indicate the presence of highly ordered lamellae of d-spacing 0.38 ± 0.01 nm. Interestingly, the interlayer spacing
between the ordered lamellae of the PAN/s-CNF carbon fiber is significantly
larger than that of PAN-based carbon fibers and conventional graphite
(0.34 nm for natural graphite40 and PAN-based
carbon fibers4,41). Unusually large carbon lamellae
were also observed similarly in carbonized samples of freeze-dried
s-CNF (d-spacing: 0.39 nm),42 which may indicate that it is a feature particular to the spinifex
raw material.

With the use of a custom-built fiber spinning unit
and low-temperature
carbonization at 1200 °C, these fibers have not been optimized
for commercial-grade production. As such, the mechanical properties
of our carbon fibers are lower than commercial PAN-based carbon fibers43 and is not considered to be directly comparable.
However, we believe that important new understandings into the potential
effect of nanocellulose additives in PAN-based carbon fibers can still
be gained by comparing within the dataset, and against the internal
control PAN fiber.

Factors for Enhanced Carbonization
In this study, we
have shown the effect that the incorporation of different nanocellulose
additives at a 0.1 wt % loading into solution-spun PAN fibers can
have on the mechanical properties of the carbon fibers produced. The
changes in the carbon fiber due to the nanocellulose incorporation
are significant, while surprisingly, the physical and chemical effects
of the nanocellulose on the solution-spun fiber or the fiber through
stabilization appear to be minimal (most likely due to the low loadings).
Clearly, the major role of the nanocellulose additive occurs during
the carbonization stage of the manufacturing process. Previous work
with electrospun carbon nanofibers reported that the incorporation
of high-aspect-ratio s-CNF into electrospun carbon nanofibers at various
loadings led to improvements in the carbonization efficiency (particularly
at 0.5 wt %).44 However, those improvements
were found to be related to the orientability of the CNF in the polymer
matrix, which is determined by the concentration or amount of the
CNF incorporated (0–10 wt %).44 In
this case, at a lower CNF loading (0.1 wt %) and a higher PAN concentration
(13 wt %), where the rheology and nanocellulose orientability effects
are negligible (Figure 1), the data suggests that physical aspects, namely, the aspect ratio
of the nanocellulose, have the greatest effect on this enhanced PAN
carbonization behavior. These carbon improvements are also inversely
correlated with the crystallinity of the nanocellulose additives,
given that the retention of higher amorphous cellulose (hemicellulose)
content enables the fibrillation of higher-aspect-ratio nanocelluloses,10,45 and these hemicelluloses are removed in the production of smaller
CNCs.

From a composite theory perspective, this effect may be
related to changes in the relative reinforcement potential of the
nanofillers during carbonization. This is because the tensile modulus
of the nanocellulose additive itself is not fixed and will increase
as it undergoes carbonization within the bulk fiber. Additionally,
flexible reinforcers (e.g., low crystallinity, high-aspect-ratio s-CNF)
will become rigid upon carbonization, further increasing the modulus
of the filler. Therefore, a high-aspect-ratio CNF in a PAN fiber may
experience a cumulative increase in its reinforcement potential during
the carbonization process due to (1) the intrinsically high aspect
ratio of the filler, followed by (2) an increasing modulus due the
formation of a cyclic structure, which lead to the loss of flexibility
and subsequent stiffening of the high-aspect-ratio nanofiber after
carbonization. In other words, the flexible high-aspect-ratio reinforcer
changes into a stiff high-aspect-ratio reinforcer upon carbonization,
where nanoparticle stiffness and aspect ratio determine the reinforcement
efficiency at fixed volumes according to Halpin–Tsai models.46 Such cumulative improvements in the reinforcement
potential would thus not be observed during the carbonization of low-aspect-ratio
CNC composites (since CNCs are rigid prior to carbonization) or a
high-aspect-ratio SWCNT additive (since it also has rigid graphitic
structure prior to carbonization). This behavior is shown diagrammatically
in Figure 6 below.

Figure 6 Halpin–Tsai
diagram highlighting the proposed origin of
the enhanced carbonization effects leading to improved mechanical
reinforcement (Ec/Em) in the carbon nanocomposites. Flexible high-aspect-ratio
CNF is compared with more rigid low-aspect-ratio CNCs. Although high-aspect-ratio
CNFs demonstrate lower reinforcement potential in the precursor composite
than more rigid CNFs, CNFs have greater reinforcement potential in
carbonized materials due to a gain in stiffness from carbonization.

Conclusions
Nanocellulose
is commonly utilized as a “green” additive
in polymer composites as a reinforcer according to the rule of mixtures
to improve the mechanical properties of the composite. This can involve
incorporating a large volume (up to 40 wt %) of rigid/stiff cellulose
nanocrystals. In this study, three different nanocellulose types were
studied in wet-spun PAN nanocomposite fibers through a stabilization
and carbonization heat treatment process. We found that PAN composite
fibers with nanocellulose additives at low loadings (0.1 wt %), when
carbonized, can demonstrate significant mechanical performance improvements
comparable to reinforced fibers with far greater nanoparticle loading,
depending on the type of nanocellulose. These effects on the carbon
fibers were correlated with increasing nanocellulose aspect ratio
and decreasing crystallinity, while no such correlations were observed
in the precursor fibers. The improvements have been isolated to occur
predominately during the carbonization stage of the process, and Raman
spectra and TEM analysis indicate that the origin of these improvements
involves internal reinforcement of the carbon fiber by increasingly
ordered carbon layers facilitated by the carbonized nanocellulose.
The mechanical and chemical changes in the four different nanocomposite
fibers were also tracked through the multistage thermal stabilization
process. While it was observed that the presence of nanocellulose
can slow the initial cyclization reactions during stabilization and
increase the fiber density after thermal stabilization, overall, the
addition of nanocellulose of varying aspect ratios and surface chemistries,
surprisingly, showed relatively little effect on the stabilization
of the fibers. Ultimately, the potential implications of these results
may include easier polymer composite processability (since high amounts
of nanofillers can negatively affect the rheology and spinning of
fibers) and lower-cost additives (due to lower amounts of nanofiller
and avoidance of acid hydrolysis processes) for carbon applications.
However, continued work is still necessary to demonstrate these effects
for commercial fibers with carbon fiber-grade PAN, commercially relevant
solution-spinning techniques, and industry know-how.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The cellulose nanofiber, “s-CNF”,
and cellulose nanocrystal, “s-CNC”, were isolated from
spinifex pulp by homogenization and acid hydrolysis, respectively,
while cotton-based CNCs, “c-CNCs”, were obtained from
Advantec filter paper (no. 1). Glacial acetic acid (99.7%, Ajax Finechem),
sulfuric acid (98%, RCI Labscan), sodium hydroxide pellets (99.9%,
Ajax Finechem), and sodium chlorite (80%, Sigma-Aldrich) were all
used as received in the pulping and bleaching processes. Composite
fibers were prepared from dispersions of different nanocellulose types
in solutions of PAN (AN: 99.5%, methyl acrylate comonomer: 0.5%, Mw: 230 000 g/mol; Goodfellow) dissolved
in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich).

Preparation of CNF from
Spinifex
As described in earlier
work,45 the CNFs were isolated from spinifex
grass by a low-cost pulping, bleaching, and homogenization process.
Briefly, this involved harvesting, washing, and grounding the spinifex
grass, after which the ground was treated with sodium hydroxide (2%
w/v NaOH) at 80 °C to remove lignin. This was followed by a bleaching
step in sodium chlorite solution (1% w/v) at 70 °C, after which
the pulp was washed with hot water. Spinifex CNFs were obtained by
passing a suspension of the bleached spinifex pulp in deionized water
through a benchtop high-pressure homogenizer (Panda 2 K NS1001L, GEA
Niro Soavi S.p.A, Italy) at 700 bar for two passes. The resulting
CNF dispersions were then exchanged into DMF by centrifugation (10 000
rpm) and decanting five times.

Preparation of CNC from
Spinifex by Acid Hydrolysis
To obtain spinifex CNC,10 the amorphous
components of the bleached spinifex pulp were digested by stirring
in sulfuric acid solution (40% v/v) at 45 °C for 3 h. The excess
aqueous acid and dissolved amorphous components were extracted by
decanting the dispersion after centrifuging at 4750 rpm for 20 min.
The spinifex fibers were re-dispersed in water, and the centrifugation
and decanting process was repeated five times. The remaining treated
fibers were then rinsed and dialyzed with deionized water for 7 days
until the fiber dispersion reached a pH of approximately pH 7, before
being re-suspended in water and ultrasonicated for 20 min at 25% amplitude
in an ice bath. These purified CNCs were then freeze-dried.

Preparation
of CNC from Cotton by Acid Hydrolysis
To
prepare CNC from cotton, Whatman filter paper (no. 1) was initially
soaked in water (0.02 g/mL) for approximately 5 days until a dispersed
pulp was formed. This pulp was then treated with concentrated sulfuric
acid (35% v/v) at 50 °C for 3.5 h while being stirred. After
cooling to room temperature, the excess acid was extracted by decanting
the dispersion after centrifugation at 4750 rpm for 20 min. This centrifugation
and decanting process was repeated four times until the pH of the
mixture was approximately 5–6. The CNC was then rinsed and
dialyzed with deionized water for 7 days until the pH reached a value
of approximately pH 7, before being re-suspended in water and ultrasonicated
for 1.5 h at 20% amplitude in an ice bath. These purified CNCs were
then freeze-dried.

Nanocellulose Characterization
Transmission
electron
microscopy (TEM) at 80 kV (Hitachi HT770) was used to study the morphology
of the various nanocellulose types. Samples were prepared by dropping
a dilute suspension of the nanocellulose onto a glow-discharged copper
TEM grid, which was allowed to dry before being stained with uranyl
acetate (2% w/v) for 10 min. The crystallinity index (CI) for each
nanocellulose type was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker
D8 Advance XRD). Graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation was generated
at 40 kV and 40 mA. All samples were scanned over a range of 2θ
= 10–90° at a scan rate of 1.2 s/step. The acidic group
content in the different nanocellulose types was quantified by conductometric
titration according to the Scandinavian pulp, paper, and board standard
method (SCAN-CM 65:0213) under standard
lab conditions without variation.

Solution Spinning
Solution-spinning solutions were
prepared from four different PAN mixtures, each containing a different
nanocellulose type (at 0.1 wt %): cotton CNC, spinifex CNC, and spinifex
CNF, which were also compared to a blank PAN solution without any
additive. The 0.1 wt % loading was selected for the investigation,
as preliminary experiments found that higher loadings reduced the
fiber elongation (Table S2). These dispersions
were prepared by first dissolving PAN in DMF (13 wt %) with constant
stirring at 70 °C for 5 h until a transparent and homogeneous
solution was obtained. Then, in a separate vessel, the nanocellulose
variants were added to DMF at the appropriate quantity and allowed
to swell and disperse for 12 h, while stirring under ambient lab conditions.
These nanocellulose suspensions were then ultrasonicated (Q500 Sonicator,
QSonica) at an output of 500 W, a frequency of 20 kHz, and an amplitude
of 20% for 4 min under an ice bath, after which they were combined
with the dissolved PAN solution. This mixture was then stirred for
24 h under ambient lab conditions and allowed to stand for 3 h to
degas before being spun. All composite PAN/nanocellulose and blank
PAN dopes were wet-spun under the same conditions, by pumping each
room temperature dope at a rate of 4 mL/min through a spinneret (200
holes, 50 μm) submerged into a deionized water/DMF coagulation
bath (1:1) under standard lab conditions (25 °C, 50% RH) (Figure S1). After coagulation, the extruded filaments
were guided over a winding rotor (DR = 2.0) into a washing bath (100%
water, room temperature, DR = 1.1), followed by a stretching bath
(100% water, 75 °C, DR = 1.8), and finally collected on a rotating
spool (Figure S1). The total draw ratio
for the fibers using this custom spinning setup was 3.9. These fibers
were dried during the spinning process by brief exposure to hot air.

Prior to spinning, the rheology of the solutions was measured at
both PAN concentrations of 6 and 13 wt % in DMF and 0.1 wt % nanocellulose
relative to PAN. The viscosity was measured using a stress-controlled
rheometer (AR 1500EX, TA Instruments) as a function of shear rate
in the range of 0.08–100 s–1 (geometry: 40
mm steel plate, 500 μm gap) at 25 °C. For the 13 wt % solution,
the data at shear rates between 0.12 and 0.5 s–1 were fit to a power law equation 1  where η is the viscosity, K is the flow consistency index, γ is the shear rate,
and n is the flow behavior index.

DSC was conducted
using Mettler Toledo DSC 1 Star with a sample
heating range between −10 and 160 °C at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min and a cooling rate of 5 °C/min. Each sample
was heated and cooled in a nitrogen environment for two cycles to
observe the thermal history.

Fiber Stabilization
Each PAN/nanocellulose
fiber was
stabilized using center-to-ends carbon fiber oxidation ovens (Despatch
Industries) consisting of four independent heating zones with controlled
air flow (Figure S1b). The fibers were
passed through each zone (4 m in length) three times, in an oxidative
atmosphere (air), with each zone set to gradually increasing temperatures
of 233, 245, 255, and 263 °C, respectively. The speed of the
stabilization line was run at 20 m/h, leading to a residence time
of 36 min per zone or 144 min for complete stabilization. Due to the
small tow size of the spun multifilament fibers, the fibers were tied
to a “carrier fiber” made of carbon fiber (12 k tow)
to enable passage of the spun fibers through the ovens under constant
tension. The tension on this carrier fiber was set as 2500 cN, with
a measured draw ratio for each zone being DR = 0.2. The tensile properties
of the precursor and stabilized fibers were measured using a Favimat
+ Robot 2 single fiber tester (Textechno H. Stein) with a 210 cN load
cell. The linear density of the fibers was determined using a gauge
length of 20 mm and a pretension of 1.5 cN/tex, while the force–elongation
curves were collected at a test speed of 2.0 mm/min from a pretension
of 0.5 cN/tex. All force–elongation data were determined for
25 replicate measurements on individual filaments loaded onto a magazine.
A density column unit (Davenport 2-COL) fitted with a temperature
controller (Julabo F12) was used to measure the mass density of the
precursor and oxidized fiber samples at 23 °C in accordance with
ASTM D1505-10: Standard Test Method for Density of Plastics by the
Density-Gradient technique. The column was filled with calcium nitrate
and distilled water with a density testing range between 1.170 and
1.415 g/cm3.

To study the effect of the various additives
on the progress of stabilization reactions of PAN, the chemical changes
through the stabilization process were monitored using a Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (Bruker Lumos) equipped with a germanium
crystal. Each sample was measured using attenuated total reflectance
mode from 800 to 4000 cm–1 with 128 scans and a
resolution of 4 cm–1. The extent of cyclization
(EOC) for PAN was then calculated using the following equation37 2  where Abs (1590) and Abs (2242) are the measured
absorbance peaks for the C=N and C≡N functional groups,
respectively.

The thermal transitions of stabilized (or partially
stabilized)
fibers were also measured using a differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC, Mettler Toledo STAR DSC 1). Samples (3 mg) were placed into
vented aluminum pans and heated from 40 to 400 °C, at a heating
rate of 20 °C/min in a nitrogen environment. The residual enthalpy
for each fiber through the stabilization process was calculated from
the integral, from baseline to baseline, for the exothermic peak at
approximately 315 °C.

Fiber Carbonization
The stabilized
fibers were carbonized
in a batch process without tension using a single-zone tube furnace
(CTF wire wound, 1300 °C, Carbolite Gero) by heating to 1200
°C at a rate of 20 °C/min in an aluminum oxide tube in a
nitrogen environment. The maximum temperature of 1200 °C was
held for 30 min before allowing the samples to cool to room temperature.
The mechanical properties of the carbon fibers were measured under
ambient lab conditions using an Instron model 5543 universal testing
machine equipped with a 5 N load cell. A single filament of each fiber
was attached to a square paper frame, which was used as a mount for
the samples onto the testing grips. The diameter of each fiber was
determined using a light microscope (Olympus BX51) prior to testing.
The tests were performed with a gauge length of 20 mm and a crosshead
speed of 5 mm/min. Each sample was tested 15 times, and the modulus
was determined from the slope of the initial stress–strain
curve. All Raman spectra for the carbon fiber samples were recorded
over a wavenumber range of 200–3500 cm–1,
using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw inVia) with a 514 nm laser using
a laser power of 10% at a 30 s acquisition. Spectra were also recorded
on both the as-obtained fiber and then “crushed or ground”
samples. Raman D/G ratios were calculated from the ratio of the intensities
of the D-band (1380 cm–1) and G-band (1595 cm–1). The carbon microstructure was imaged by TEM (JEM2100,
200 kV). Samples were prepared by grinding the carbon fibers and dispersing
the ground powder in ethanol, followed by deposition onto a holey
carbon grid.
