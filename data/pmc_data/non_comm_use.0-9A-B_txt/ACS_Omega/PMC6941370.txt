(−)-5-Hydroxygoniothalamin, (−)-5-acetylgoniothalamin,
and (+)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin, isolated from the Goniothalamus genus, are synthesized from triacetyl-O-d-glucal by employing the Ferrier reaction, Mitsunobu reaction, and
Jones oxidation as key steps. The synthetic procedure also yields
the epimers of (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin and (+)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin
employing acid-mediated transition-metal-free epimerization at C-5
of styryllactones. Further studies reveal that the epimerization is
facilitated by the phenyl group present on the styryllactones. Also,
depending on the dihydroxylation reaction conditions, various analogues
of saturated styryllactones are synthesized utilizing oxa-Michael
reaction conditions.

Introduction
Most of the bioactive styryllactones have
been isolated from the Goniothalamus genus. The first
styryllactone goniothalamin 1 was isolated from the bark
of Cryptocarya
caloneura(1) (Annonaceae
family) and later on has been isolated from several species belonging
to the Goniothalamus genus.2−5 Pompimon and co-workers6 isolated (−)-5-hydroxygonio-thalamin 4, (−)-5-acetylgoniothalamin 5, and (−)-goniopypyrone 7 from Goniothalamus marcanii belonging to the Annonaceae family that is mostly found in Thailand
and are being used in the Thai traditional system of medicine.7 Styryllactones isolated from the Goniothalamus genus have shown strong cytotoxicity.4,8 (+)-5-Hydroxygoniothalamin 6, an enantiomer of (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4, has also been isolated from Goniothalamus dolichocarpus(9) (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Their anticancer activity prompted
us to take up the total synthesis
of (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4 and (−)-5-acetylgoniothalamin 5 from a common starting material, tri-O-acetyl-d-glucal 9. The synthesis of compound 6 was earlier reported by various groups,10 and the synthesis of (+)-5-acetoxygoniothalamin is reported by Pan
et al.11 The retrosynthetic approach for
the synthesis of compounds 4 and 5 is delineated
in Scheme 1. Natural
product (−)-5-acetylgoniothalamin 5 can be synthesized
from (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4 by a simple
acetylation reaction. We envisaged that (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4 can be obtained from compound 8 by utilizing
the Mitsunobu and Jones oxidation reactions, respectively. Compound 8 could potentially be synthesized from triacetyl-O-d-glucal 9 by using the Ferrier
rearrangement12 and Wittig reaction as
key steps.10a

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis
of the Synthesis of Styryllactones 4 and 5
Compound 10 was synthesized from 9 in
five steps by following known literature procedures.13 The primary hydroxyl group of compound 10 was
oxidized to the aldehyde by using PCC to furnish 11 as
a yellow oil and was used for the next step immediately as such, as
it was found to be unstable at room temperature (Scheme 2). Compound 11 was immediately treated with sulfone in THF at −78 °C
(Method A, see Experimental Section) to obtain (E)-olefin; however, we obtained the
desired (E)-olefin 8 in poor yield (38%).
To increase the yield of the desired (E)-olefin 8, we employed the traditional Wittig olefination reaction
conditions, with benzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in THF at room
temperature (Method B, see Experimental
Section) to furnish 8 in 70% yield. It is pertinent
to mention that the earlier reported10a Wittig olefination of 5,6-dihydropyran-2-ones with benzyltriphenylphosphonium
bromide had resulted in (Z)-olefin formation. The
formation of (E)-olefin 8 from compound 11 under the same reaction conditions may be due to the presence
of an ethoxy group in compound 11 instead of the keto
group as well as different stereochemistry at the aldehydic centre.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of O-TBS-(−)-5-Hydroxygoniothalamin 14
Compound 8 upon deprotection with
TBAF furnished compound 12 {[α]D24 +30.14 (c 1.7, CHCl3)}. Now
for the synthesis of 4, inversion of the stereochemistry
at the C-4 group of compound 12 was achieved by utilizing
the Mitsunobu protocol followed
by ester deprotection to yield epimerized alcohol 13 {[α]D24 −90.87 (c 0.9, CHCl3)}. The C-4 epimerized alcohol, 13, was treated
with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole
in DMF at room temperature to afford a TBS-protected compound, which
upon Jones oxidation afforded lactone 14 as a colorless
oil. Surprisingly, the deprotection of the TBS group of compound 16 with BF3·OEt2 furnished a mixture
of two compounds, which were identified as compound 4 (30%, oil) and its C-5 epimer compound 15 (60%, colorless
solid). The formation of the C-5 epimerized compound, 15, was confirmed by NMR and its single-crystal X-ray analysis14 (Scheme 3). To study this epimerization reaction further, we synthesized
another styryllactone 16 (colorless oil, 57% yield) from
compound 8 by Jones oxidation (Scheme 3). Interestingly, when we treated this TBS-protected
styryllactone 16 under BF3·OEt2 reaction conditions, we obtained two products, one was the TBS-deprotected
compound 17 (30%, pale yellow solid) and the other product
was found to be the C-5 epimerized product, i.e., (+)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 6 (62%, yellow oil). The spectral data of the synthesized
compound, 6, were found to be consistent with those of
the reported natural product.10

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of (−)-5-Hydroxygoniothalamin 4 and
(+)-5-Hydroxygoniothalamin 6 along with Their C-5 Epimers 15 and 17
The formation of the unexpected C-5 epimerized
products 15 and 17 encouraged us to investigate
this epimerization
reaction in other 5,6-dihydropyran-2-one systems (α,β-unsaturated
δ-lactones). To investigate this unexpected epimerization reaction,
we prepared various substituted 5,6-dihydropyran-2-ones by following
literature procedures.15 We reacted various
5,6-dihydropyran-2-one systems under the same reaction conditions
mentioned above (Scheme S1, see the Supporting
Information). However, we did not observe any epimerized product,
and only the TBS-deprotected products were obtained. To study this
epimerization reaction further, we synthesized another styryllactone 16 (colorless oil, 57% yield) from compound 8 by Jones oxidation (Scheme 3). Interestingly, when we treated this TBS-protected styryllactone 16 under BF3·OEt2 reaction conditions,
we obtained two products, one was the TBS-deprotected compound, 17 (30%, pale yellow solid), and the other product was found
to be the C-5 epimerized product, i.e., (+)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 6 (62%, yellow oil). The spectral data of the synthesized
compound, 6, were found to be consistent with those of
the reported natural product.10 It is evident
from the results obtained from Scheme 3 that epimerization occurs only in the styryllactones
and not in other 5,6-dihydropyran-2-ones. Palladium-catalyzed epimerization
of 5-vinyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-ones derived from d-glucono-δ-lactones has been reported16 in the literature. It is pertinent to mention here that
we have observed acid-catalyzed epimerization in styryllactones.

Based on these results, we proposed a plausible mechanism for the
formation of epimerized products, as delineated in Scheme 4. When TBS-protected styryllactone 14 was treated with BF3·OEt2, first
it undergoes TBS deprotection to furnish compound 4.
The BF3·OEt2 present in the reaction medium
coordinates with the carbonyl group of compound 4. This
facilitates the ring opening leading to the formation of intermediate A. This intermediate A undergoes ring closure
leading to the formation of a thermodynamically stable compound, 15.

Scheme 4 Plausible Mechanism of Epimerization at C-5
It is interesting to mention here that by utilizing
this unexpected
C-5 epimerization reaction, we synthesized all possible isomers of
(−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4, i.e., 15, 6, and 17 starting from triacetyl-O-d-glucal 9 as the starting material.
Compound (−)-5-acetylgoniothalamin 5 was obtained
from (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4 by acetylation
as a pale yellow solid (85%). The absolute configuration and structure
were further confirmed by its single-crystal X-ray analysis (Scheme 5).14

Scheme 5 Synthesis of (−)-5-Acetylgoniothalamin 5
We further envisaged that (−)-goniopypyrone 7 could be synthesized from (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4 by dihydroxylation followed by intramolecular oxa-Michael
addition reactions. To synthesize 7, the TBS-protected
lactone, 16, was subjected to Upjohn dihydroxylation
conditions.17 The reaction mixture upon
completion of the reaction showed a single spot on TLC and upon usual
basic workup furnished the expected dihydroxylated product, 18, and to our surprise, we also obtained the oxa-Michael
addition product, 19, due to the basic workup conditions
(Scheme 6). The formation
of oxa-Michael addition15,18 product 19 along with dihydroxylated product 18 could be due to
quenching of the reaction mixture with sat. NaHCO3. The
base might abstract a proton from the benzylic OH group, which in
turn facilitates the formation of the oxa-Michael addition product, 19. Finally, the formation of product 18 was
further confirmed using single-crystal X-ray analysis.14 Our attempts on the deprotection of the TBS
group of compound 19 resulted in the formation of a complex
mixture, and hence, it was not pursued further. When TBS-protected
lactone 16 was subjected to Sharpless dihydroxylation
conditions19−22 [AD-mix-α in t-BuOH/H2O (1:1)
in the presence of methanesulfonamide], which led to the formation
of an intramolecular oxa-Michael addition product 20 (75%
yield) as a single product instead of the usual dihydroxylation product, B (Scheme 6). The formation of product 20 might be due to the close
proximity of the C-6 hydroxyl group than the benzylic hydroxyl group.
Further, the structure of the intramolecular oxa-Michael addition
product, 20, was confirmed by its single-crystal X-ray
analysis.14

Scheme 6 Dihydroxylation Studies
of Styryllactones
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully achieved
the synthesis of all
possible isomers of (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4 from triacetyl-O-d-glucal 9 by utilizing the unexpected epimerization reaction of styryllactones.
We have also synthesized (−)-5-acetylgoniothalamin 5 from (−)-5-hydroxygoniothalamin 4. It is pertinent
to mention here that the dihydroxylation reactions performed using
either Upjohn or Sharpless conditions resulted in the formation of
oxa-Michael addition products, which allowed the synthesis of various
saturated styryllactones.

General Information
All melting points were recorded
using a Büchi melting point apparatus in open capillaries and
are uncorrected. Flash chromatography was performed with a CombiFlash
Rf 200i apparatus equipped with a UV/vis detector and an ELSD (Isco
Teledyne Inc.) using a RediSep prepacked column (SiO2). 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 200, 400, or 500
MHz spectrometer and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 50,
100, or 125 MHz. Chemical shifts are reported as δ values (ppm)
relative to the residual solvent peak of CDCl3. HRMS (ESI)
data were recorded using an Orbitrap (quadrupole plus ion trap). Petroleum
ether and ethyl acetate were distilled by the usual methods. Dried
solvents were purchased and used without further drying. Molecular
sieves were activated prior to use and kept under vacuum while not
in use.

TBS-protected ene-lactone 16 (135 mg) was dissolved in acetone/H2O (2:1) at rt, and
K2OsO4·2H2O and the NMO were
added to the resulting solution. The reaction mixture turns black.
The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 24 h. After completion
of the reaction (TLC), the reaction mixture was poured into aq. Na2S2O3 (5%, 20 mL) and stirred for 30
min. The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (3 × 20 mL). The
combined organic layers were washed with a saturated aqueous solution
of NaHCO3, and then brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was
purified by silica gel flash chromatography (eluted with 8% EtOAc–petroleum
ether) to furnish diol 18 (89.4 mg, 60%) and oxa-Michael
addition product 19 (15 mg, 10%) as colorless solids,

(20)
A round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic
stirrer was charged with tert-butyl alcohol (5 mL),
water (5 mL), and 1.4 g of AD-mix-α. Stirring at rt produced
two clear phases; the lower aqueous phase appears bright yellow. The
mixture was cooled to 0 °C. The olefin compound, 16, was added at once and the heterogeneous slurry was stirred vigorously
at 0 °C for 24 h (progress was monitored by TLC). While the mixture
was stirred at 0 °C, anhydrous sodium sulfite (1.5 g) was added,
and the mixture was allowed to warm to rt and further stirred for
30 min. EtOAc (10 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and after
separation of the layers, the aqueous phase was further extracted
with EtOAc (3 × 5 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo.
The crude reaction mixture, thus, obtained was further purified by
silica gel flash column chromatography eluting with EtOAc/petroleum
ether (1:1) to afford exclusively the oxa-Michael addition product, 20 (82 mg, 65%), as a colorless solid.
