A facile, cost-effective,
and high-throughput screening method was developed for enzyme-based
assays based on Robolid/Microplate (RLMP) platform. The RLMP platform
is constructed by immobilizing enzyme on commercial robolids and combining
it with a standard 96-well microplate to achieve high-throughput analysis.
The initiation and quenching of enzymatic reaction can be performed
by simply sandwiching or unsealing the enzyme-immobilized robolids
and the sample-containing microplate. This platform enables measurements
of multiple target analytes simultaneously based on immobilized enzymatic
reactions, with analysis time independent of the number of wells in
the microplate. Using urea as the model analyte, we have shown that
the RLMP platform exhibits large linear detection range of up to 10
mM, fast analysis time of 30 min/96 samples, as well as good reproducibility
and stability. Measurements of urea in human urine and serum samples
were performed using the RLMP platform and were compared with the
commercial urea test kit. A good correlation was found between the
two methods. This study shows that the present RLMP platform has promising
prospects for detection of clinical markers and application in disease
diagnosis and biochemical analysis.

1 Introduction
The need for simple, rapid,
cost-effective, and high-throughput
screening approaches has boosted the development of applications in
practical clinical assays and disease diagnosis. Compared with traditional
analytical methods, enzyme-based assays have several distinct advantages,
such as high sensitivity and specificity, cost-effectiveness, and
the possibilities for miniaturization and mass production. Thus, enzyme-based
assays are of great value for qualitative and quantitative analysis
of a variety of target analytes in biomedicine and clinical diagnosis.1−3 It has been shown that the elevated enzyme activities in clinical
samples provide important information about the disease and treatment
options4−6 and that enzyme-catalyzed reactions provide efficient
assays for a variety of biomarkers for clinical diagnosis covering
nitrogenous metabolites,7,8 carbohydrates and carbohydrate
metabolites,9,10 lipids and lipoproteins,11,12 and so forth.

Compared to free enzyme, the applications of
enzyme immobilization
can improve the stability and reusability of an enzyme as well as
greatly reduce experimental cost, sample manipulation, and analysis
time.13 Thus, enzyme immobilization has
played an important role in developing enzyme-based biosensors.14,15 A number of techniques have been developed for biosensor applications
with immobilizing enzymes as well as cells on different support matrices,
such as functionalized polymers, biocompatible composite materials,
nanomaterials, and sol–gel and hydrogel materials.16,17 Despite these significant advantages, however, it remains a quite
challenging task for immobilized enzyme-based biosensors to accomplish
high-throughput assays for multiple samples, which is essential to
meet the growing demand for clinical diagnostics. One approach to
overcome this issue is by integrating the microchip devices with microarray
screening technologies. Such microarray approach can offer the ability
to perform assays on array platforms consisting of thousands of reaction
spots, thereby greatly increasing throughput.18−20 However, the
sophisticated microarray fabrication, in a manner, impedes analysis
of these arrays, particularly for real-time analysis and application
popularization.

In the present study, we aim to develop a facile,
cost-effective
method for high-throughput screening assays based on immobilized enzyme
biosensors. Commercially available robolids of a 96-well microplate
are employed as support for immobilization of enzymes. Robolid is
a microplate seal that incorporates the silicone capmats into a standard
polystyrene plate lid. We will show that the enzyme-modified robolids
combined with a standard 96-well plate can be used as a robust high-throughput
analysis platform, which is dubbed as the Robolid/Microplate (RLMP)
platform in the present study. Figure 1A shows schematically the idea of the RLMP for high-throughput
assays. We selected alginate–chitosan as a matrix for enzyme
encapsulation and immobilized enzyme on the robolids to form the enzyme
microreactors. Such robolid-based enzyme reactors then attach to each
individual well of the 96-well plate to perform the assays for multiple
samples (Figure 1A-a).
Initiating (or quenching) the enzyme reactions in the RLMP platform
can be easily achieved by simply sandwiching (or turning over the
plate) the enzyme-immobilized robolids onto the sample-containing
wells (Figure 1A-b,c).
Adding quenching reagents or heating procedures is not necessary.
Thus, complicated manipulation for controlling enzymatic reaction
in traditional enzyme assays using a 96-well microplate can be avoided.
After the enzymatic reactions are stopped, the microplate containing
the reaction solution in each well is ready for various detection
analyses (Figure 1A-d,e).
The analysis is able to detect as much as 96 samples in a single plate
simultaneously and makes the measurement time independent with the
number of wells in the microplate. The robolids are commercially available,
and enzyme-immobilized robolids can be reusable and cost-effective,
which are particularly beneficial for clinical practice and promotion.

diagram of RLMP assay process. (B) Fabrication procedure
of the urease-RLMP platform for high-throughput urea determination.

We use urea as the model target
analyte to evaluate the feasibility
and performance of the proposed RLMP platform. As urea is the main
end product of human protein metabolism, its determination has become
one of the most useful and direct ways of clinical diagnostics and
medical care in the appraisal of renal functions. For urea measurements,
the applied chemistry has been dominated by urease-catalyzed hydrolysis
involving colorimetric or electrochemical detection.21−24 Urease catalyzes the
hydrolysis of urea to carbamic acid and ammonia, which then decompose,
respectively, to bicarbonate and another molecule of ammonia  In this work, measurements of urea
in human
urine and serum samples were performed by the RLMP platform, and the
results were compared with commercial urea test kit.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of the Urease-RLMP
Platform
We first investigated and optimized several key
experimental parameters
involved in the fabrication process of the urease-RLMP platform, which
may affect the enzyme reactivity. The results are presented in Figure 2. The immobilization
yield in Figure 2 represents
the ratio of the specific activity of the immobilized enzyme to that
of the free enzyme (in sodium alginate). It is known that different
sodium alginate concentrations can form gels with different strengths
in the presence of BaCl2 and that the encapsulated enzyme
activity would be affected by the gel strength. As shown in Figure 2A, the maximum immobilization
yield was observed at 2.0% sodium alginate concentration. At this
concentration, we found that the alginate/urease sol can easily form
a hemispherical and uniform gel (diameter, 3 mm; height, 2 mm) with
high strength. At lower concentration, however, the alginate gel was
soft and flaccid and the urease leaching was increased according to
the storage studies. On the other hand, with excessive increase of
the concentration of sodium alginate, the diffusional resistances
to the substrate offered by alginate gel were increased and resulted
in a decrease of hydrolysis of urea. For the subsequent experiments,
the concentration of sodium alginate was fixed at 2.0%. The gelation
time of alginate with BaCl2 is another parameter for the
assays using the urease-RLMP platform. It was found that, with increasing
incubation time of alginate/BaCl2 from 0.5 to 2 h, the
immobilization yield increases and then reaches its maximum value
at 2 h. After that, however, the immobilization yield was reduced
with further increase in the gelation time (Figure 2B), which could be attributed to overhigh
diffusional resistances with large degree of gelation. The result
is consistent with the report wherein alginate beads were formed and
stirred for 2–3 h to generate rigidity when soybean urease
was immobilized on alginate.25

Effects of sodium alginate concentration (A), curing time of sodium
alginate (B), chitosan concentrations (C), and curing time of chitosan
(D). Urease concentration was kept at 7 mg/mL. Urea solution (4.0
mM) was used as the test sample. Each data point in the figures was
an averaged result of three repeatable assays. The immobilization
yield represents the ratio of the specific activity of the immobilized
enzyme to that of the free enzyme (in sodium alginate).

In Figure 2C, the
effect of chitosan concentration on the immobilization yield is shown.
Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide obtained from partial chitin
deacetylation. It can form polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) with alginate.
As shown in Figure 2C, the optimal concentration of chitosan for the assay was determined
to be 2.0% in the present study. It is noted that, as the layer of
chitosan on the surface of the alginate gel could cause the transfer
resistance of the substrate to penetrate into the alginate/enzyme
gel, it can greatly reduce the leakage of the enzyme and enhance the
stability of the robolid enzyme reactor. Indeed, one can see from Figure 2D that there are
no apparent differences for nine cycle-runs with the alginate/chitosan
incubation time of 30 or 45 min. The stability and reusability of
the urease microreactor will be further demonstrated in Figure 5 and will be discussed in the
following section.

The amount of enzyme and the enzymatic reaction
time for urea assay
were further investigated. The urease concentration varied from 1.0
to 11.0 mg/mL. The activity of urease reached the maximum at 7 mg/mL
and became almost constant at higher concentrations, as shown in Figure 3A. The effect of
enzymatic reaction time on the absorbance of product of immobilized
urease was studied by incubating the enzyme–substrate reaction
mixture for 6–30 min. As shown in Figure 3B, with increasing incubation time, the absorbance
of the product increases quickly at the initial step and then reaches
its maximum value at 25 min. Considering both analysis speed and urea
detection sensitivity, 10 min was set as the reaction time.

Figure 3 Effect of urease
concentration (A) and enzymatic reaction time
(B) on product absorbance on RLMP platform. Enzyme reaction was performed
at constant temperature (37 °C), and substrate urea concentration
was 4.0 mM.

2.2 Performance
of the Urease-RLMP Platform
Under these optimized conditions,
the sensitivity and linear range
of the proposed RLMP platform for urea assay were investigated.

Standard solutions with various concentrations of urea were used
as substrate. The dose–response curve exhibits excellent linear
dependence in a wide urea concentration range of 0.01–10 mM
(Figure 4). The linear
fitting result is A560 = 0.1541C + 0.0491 (R2 = 0.9958), where A560 and C represent the absorption
at 560 nm and the concentration of urea, respectively. The limit of
detection (LOD) was determined by obtaining signals of multiple reagent
blanks (n = 8) according to the equation26  where S is the standard deviation
of the blank measurements and A is the slope of the
linear calibration curve obtained using standards ranging from 0.01
to 10 mM urea. The LOD was then calculated as 0.005 mM urea. Compared
with other methods for urea measurement,22,27−30 in addition to its low LOD and large linear detection range, the
RLMP platform exhibits fast analysis time, that is, up to 30 min/96
samples. The Michaelis constant (Km) of
immobilized urease was derived by the Lineweaver–Burk plot,
as shown in Figure 4B. The Km value is determined to be 6.22
± 0.23 mM using the RLMP platform, which is close to that by
free urease (4.05 ± 0.31 mM). This result indicates that there
is no significant structural change of the enzyme or reduction of
accessibility of the substrate to the active sites of the immobilized
urease in our fabricated RLMP platform.

Figure 4 Dose–response
curve of urea (A) and Michaelis–Menten
curve for urease-RLMP platform (B). Urease concentration was kept
at 7 mg/mL.

Compared to free enzyme,
one advantage for the application of enzyme
immobilization is the reusability of the enzyme. In Figure 5A, we show that, using alginate–chitosan for immobilization,
the enzyme can still maintain over 80% of its reactivity after nine
continuous runs. The loss of activity of entrapped enzyme could be
a result of the leakage of enzyme from the barium alginate–chitosan
gels as results of washing of gels at the end of each cycle or conformational
changes by repeated uses. If only alginate is used for enzyme immobilization,
however, the reactivity drops to 57% after just five runs. The results
indicate that the reusability of the enzyme reactor can be enhanced
by using alginate–chitosan for immobilization in the RLMP platform.
To demonstrate the reusability of the reactor for different microplates,
we split the same human urine sample diluted 200-fold into eight microplates,
followed by the successive tests using the same urease-immobilized
robolids. Phosphate buffer was used as blank and added in the last
two wells for each microplate. The results showed that the immobilized
enzyme can still maintain over 78% of its reactivity after eight successive
tests for different microplates.

Figure 5 (A) Reusability of the robolid-based enzyme
reactor using alginate–chitosan
(red) or alginate (black) for immobilization. (B) Storage stability
of the free and immobilized urease. Each data point in the figures
is an averaged result of three repeatable assays.

The storage stability of free and immobilized urease is presented
in Figure 5B. The free
and immobilized enzymes were stored at 4 °C, and their activities
were measured in 30 days. As shown in the figure, after 7 days, the
robolid-based reactor retained 98% of its enzyme activity, whereas
for free urease, the activity decreased to 88%. After the 30 day storage,
the robolid-based reactor still presented 88% of its activity. This
observation indicates that the immobilized urease on robolids exhibits
greater stability than the free enzyme. These results could be explained
by the fact that immobilization can reduce the interaction between
enzyme molecules, leading to the deactivation of the enzyme activity.

Anti-interference properties are important considerations for the
proposed method. The possible interferences of various biological
and organic species in the urea determination were investigated, and
the obtained results are shown in Figure 6. It was found that no significant interfering
effects were found for urea solutions with interferents, after adding
a sample of 1.0 mM urea solution with different interferents. Thus,
the presence of these species did not influence urea determination.

Figure 6 Selectivity
of the RLMP platform in urea detection. The interference
effect of various interferents on the 1.0 urea solution was examined
under optimum conditions. Each data point in the figure is an averaged
result of three repeatable assays.

2.3 Real Sample Analysis Using the RLMP Platform
To evaluate the reproducibility of the immobilized urease reactor
for different vessels of 96-well microplate, standard urea solution
of 1 mM concentration was added in 30 wells of the microplate, whereas
a human urine sample diluted 200-fold and a human serum sample diluted
3-fold were added in the rest of wells (32 wells for each). Phosphate
buffer was used as blank and added in the remaining two wells of the
microplate. The results show good reproducibility in terms of product
absorbance with relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 6.5% (n = 30), 6.7% (n = 32), and 6.8% (n = 32) for 1 mM standard urea, human urine, and serum samples,
respectively.

To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
RLMP platform for analytical application of urea detection, the recovery
test was performed by the standard addition method. As shown in Table 1, the obtained recoveries
ranged from 96.4 to 103.0% in the spiked ultrapure water, from 95.3
to 104.0% in the spiked human urine samples, and from 97.1 to 107.0%
in the spiked human serum samples, with three different additions
of urea to the ultrapure water and diluted urine and serum samples
(urine diluted by 200-fold; serum diluted by 3-fold). RSD values of
the assays (n = 3) are less than 1.83, 2.23, and
2.32% in the spiked ultrapure water, spiked human urine samples, and
spiked human serum samples, respectively.

Measurements of urea in human urine and serum samples were performed
by the RLMP platform, and the results were compared with urea assay
kit using free urease. A total of 28 human urine samples from healthy
volunteers were diluted 100, 150, and 200 times, whereas 28 human
serum samples collected from Beijing Friendship Hospital were diluted
3, 6, and 9 times before analysis. The results are shown in Figure 7. The results of
nearly all of the volunteers were in the normal urea range (155–380
mM23 in human urine). For urea in serum
samples, there are 8 samples out of the 28 volunteers that are beyond
the normal range of 2.5–7.5 mM,31 whereas the others are in the range. The insets in Figure 7 show the correlation between
the results of our RLMP method and those of the clinical urea assay
kit. The results show very good correlations for either the urine
or serum samples, indicating that our RLMP platform is a reliable
approach for urea determination in real samples.

result of three repeatable assays.

3 Conclusions
A novel RLMP platform for
simultaneous analysis of multiple samples
has been reported, using commercially available robolids as support
for immobilizing enzyme and a standard 96-well microplate for detection.
The platform integrates the advantages of both enzyme immobilization
and microplate analysis and thus exhibits several salient features
for enzyme-based clinical assays, for example, high throughput, parallelization,
and cost-effectiveness. The feasibility and performance of the proposed
RLMP platform for clinical application have been evaluated using urea
as the model target analyte. The results show that the platform is
a reliable approach for urea determination in real urine samples with
low LOD, large linear detection range, fast analysis time, good stability,
and reproducibility. To further reduce the leakage of enzyme, a chemical
process (e.g., cross-linking with glutaraldehyde) might be necessary
to reduce the release of the enzymes from the hydrogel mesh. The present
method can be easily extended to various kinds of enzyme-based assays
as well as inhibition assays, by immobilizing different enzymes on
the robolids. We should mention that the throughput of our RLMP platform
is determined by the number of wells in a microplate. It is important
to note that hundred- and even thousand-well microplates are now commercially
available for clinical assays. Our study indicates that the RLMP platform
has promising prospects for the detection of clinical markers and
application in disease diagnosis and biochemical analysis.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Instrumentation
The solution dispensation was performed
using a 96-channel pipetting system (Medusa 96; D.C.Labware Ltd.,
Guangdong, China). Microplate analysis was performed by Epoch 2 Microplate
Spectrophotometer (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

4.2 Materials
and Reagents
Urease (E.C.3.5.1.5, Canavalia
ensiformis), 96-well robolid and polystyrene
microplate, chitosan (medium molecular weight; deacetylation degree,
75–85%) and poly-l-lysine (PLL; molecular weight,
150 000) were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO).
Urea was obtained from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Urea Assay Berthelot
kit, buffered chromogen (3% (w/v) phenol + 0.015% (w/v) sodium nitroprusside),
and alkaline hypochlorite solution (1.5% (w/v) sodium hydroxide +
0.12% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite) were purchased from Beijing Leagene
Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Sodium alginate (medium
viscosity; molecular weight, 80–120 kDa; mannuronate/guluronate
ratio, 0.6) was obtained from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research
Institute (Tianjin, China). All other reagents were of analytical
grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure water was used
to prepare all solutions.

The human urine samples were collected
from healthy volunteers and centrifuged for 20 min at a speed of 1000
rpm to remove bacteria and protein aggregates. The supernatants were
filtered and diluted 100, 150, and 200 times with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) before analysis. The human serum samples were collected
from Beijing Friendship Hospital (Beijing, China) in accordance with
the rules of the local ethical committee. The serum samples were diluted
with PBS buffer three, six, and nine times before analysis.

4.3 Fabrication Process of the Urease-RLMP Platform
The
commercial robolids of 96-well microplate made of polystyrene
contain 96 silicone-made micropillars (pillar diameter, 5 mm; pillar-to-pillar
distance, 2 mm). The fabrication process of the urease-RLMP platform
is schematically shown in Figure 1B. The enzyme urease in alginate can be strongly attached
on the silicone-made micropillars of the robolids through poly-l-lysine (PLL) and BaCl2. PLL with amine groups was
absorbed on the silicone surface and then negatively charged alginate
(−COO– groups) was gelled by Ba2+ and attached to positively charged PLL (−NH3+ groups) by an ionic interaction. Chitosan as a polycationic
polymer was used to control the disintegration of alginate gel, on
the basis of the ionic interactions between −COO– groups of alginate and −NH3+ groups
of chitosan.32 The operation involving
reagent transfer and dispensation was performed with a 96-channel
pipetting system. The amount of NH3 liberated in the wells
was determined on the basis of the Berthelot reaction.33,34

A 96-well microplate, each well containing 50 μL of
PLL at a concentration of 0.01% w/v, was first tightly sealed by robolids. The microplate was
then turned over, allowing the micropillar surfaces of the robolids
to be incubated in PLL for 0.5 h at room temperature to ensure the
deposition of PLL on the silicone micropillar surface. After the microplate
was detached, the robolids were washed with phosphate buffer and dried
at room temperature. BaCl2 (30 μL, 0.2 M) was simultaneously
dispensed on the surface of each of the 96 PLL-coated micropillars
using a 96-channel pipetting system. The robolids were then dried
overnight at room temperature. To encapsulate urease in alginate on
the robolids, 10 μL of urease–alginate mixture was spotted
on the PLL/BaCl2-coated robolids. The suspension of urease
in low-viscosity alginate was prepared by mixing 7 mg of urease powder
in 1 mL of 2.0% alginate solution and stirred for 1 h to ensure complete
mixing. To increase the gelling of alginate and BaCl2,
the alginate-coated robolids were attached to a 96-well microplate
containing 100 μL of 0.1 M BaCl2 in each well. This
allows the robolid surface to be incubated in the BaCl2 solution. After the microplate was placed on a chilling deck at 12 °C
for 2 h, the robolids were removed from the microplate and washed
with phosphate buffer twice. Chitosan (30 μL, 2% (v/v)) was
then dispensed on the tip of urease/alginate-coated micropillars,
and the robolids were incubated on a chilling deck at 12 °C for
0.5 h. The application of chitosan can decrease the disintegration
of the urease–alginate gel, based on the ionic interactions
between the −COO– groups of alginate and
the −NH3+ groups of chitosan, which can
form polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) between alginate and chitosan.
After the urease was immobilized, the robolids were washed with phosphate
buffer and stored at 4–8 °C before use.

4.4 Urea Determination
For urea determination
using the urease-RLMP platform, 80 μL of standard urea solutions
with desired concentrations and diluted human urine or serum samples
were added in the wells of a 96-well microplate, which was then sealed
with the urease-immobilized robolids. The enzymatic reaction was started
by turning over the microplate to mix the solution in each well with
the immobilized urease on the surface of the robolids. After the enzyme
reactions were performed for 10 min at 37 °C, the RLMP platform
was turned over again and the robolids were separated from the microplate
to stop the enzymatic reactions. For measuring the amount of ammonium
produced, 80 μL of buffered chromogen and 80 μL of alkaline
hypochlorite for Berthelot reaction were added to each well of the
microplate. After 20 min derivatization reaction at 37 °C, absorbance
at 560 nm was recorded using Epoch 2 Microplate Spectrophotometer.

The urea determination in human urine and serum samples was also
performed using commercial urea assay Berthelot kit. Briefly, 40 μL
of standard solutions of urea with desired concentrations and diluted
human urine or serum samples were added into the wells of 96-well
microplate, followed by adding 40 μL of urease working solution,
which was dissolved in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After the
reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 10 min, the amount of ammonium
was measured by adding 80 μL of buffered chromogen and 80 μL
of alkaline hypochlorite to each well and absorbance at 560 nm of
reaction solution was recorded used Epoch 2 Microplate Spectrophotometer
after 20 min incubation for derivatization reaction.
