The catalytic efficacy
of silver nanoparticles was investigated
toward the chemoselective reduction of nitro-tetrazole or amino acid-substituted
derivatives into the corresponding amines in high isolated yields.
This highly efficient protocol was thereafter applied toward the multicomponent
reaction synthesis of heterocyclic dihydroquinoxalin-2-ones with high
isolated yields. The reaction proceeds with low catalyst loading (0.8–1.4
mol %) and under mild catalytic conditions, a very good functional-group
tolerance, and high yields and can be easily scaled up to more than
1 mmol of product. Thus, the present catalytic methodology highlights
a useful synthetic application. Different molecules are designed and
accordingly synthesized with the current protocol that could play
the role of inhibitors of the soluble epoxide hydrolase, an important
target for therapies against hypertension or inflammation.

Introduction
The discovery of combinatorial
methodologies to yield organic scaffolds
in more efficient ways, such as waste reduction, cost, and less energy
demanding, is a key challenge in synthetic chemistry. More specifically,
the reduction of the nitro group may yield amines and this fundamental
transformation is frequently used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals, dye intermediates, and pigments, as well as for a variety
of fine chemicals.1 The most promising
route for the conversion of −NO2 to −NH2 is the transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenation process,2 but the observed chemoselectivity is rather low,
especially when other reducible groups are present. In this direction,
noble metal nanoparticles such as gold (AuNPs)3,4 and
silver (AgNPs),5,6 as well as cobalt, iron, and manganese-based
compounds or oxides7−9 have been employed as catalysts in the reduction
of nitro aromatic compounds. Both hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation
processes have been successfully used for the selective nitro group
reduction to the corresponding amine but have significant drawback.
The former requires high temperatures
and H2 pressures and is applicable in monosubstituted aromatic
nitro compounds; however, transfer hydrogenation is a chemoselective
process employed at ambient conditions using several reducing agents
such as borohydrides, hydrosilanes, CO/H2O, and HCOONH4.4 Therefore, the development of
new protocols and synthetic strategies that will provide complex as
well as functionalized molecules, not only efficient but also chemoselectively,
environmentally benign as well as tolerant, including a diverse array
of functional moieties and protecting groups, is of high interest
and value.10,11

Multicomponent reactions
(MCRs) are very often tagged as atom-economic,
step-efficient with high exploratory power with regard to chemical
space, processes.12,13 Using the MCR principle, rapid
and easy access to organic scaffolds with high diversity (more than
500 different scaffolds) can be achieved. Consequently, the industrial
and academic synthetic community uses this method to design and discover
biologically active compounds applicable in medicinal chemistry and
drug discovery.14 In addition, MCRs are
the perfect example of a synthetic hub;13 they are highly compatible with a range of unprotected orthogonal
functional groups, thus permitting subsequent transformations on a
second level.12,15−17 The degree
of diversity and complexity that can be achieved following this protocol
is highly increased, and therefore the discovery of new methodologies
that will postmodify the original MCR “core” is of great
importance and value.

So far, we have demonstrated the catalytic
efficacy of supported
AuNPs and AgNPs on mesoporous titania and silica (Au/TiO2, Ag/TiO2, and Ag/HMS), toward the chemoselective reduction
(via transfer hydrogenation) of a series of aromatic nitroarenes to
the corresponding anilines and/or N-aryl hydroxylamines
under mild conditions and applying fast and clean reaction processes.18−22 In all cases, simple borohydrides, boranes, hydrosilanes, and hydrazine
were used as reducing agents (Scheme 1). Building
on these findings, we attempt herein to combine—for the first
time—the application of these catalytic systems in the highly
diverse and complex environment of the MCR chemical space. More specifically,
the Ag/HMS–NaBH4 system was employed to reduce selectively
the nitro groups in the presence of other easily reducible moieties
such as carbonyl, amide, ester, and halogen, without the need of a
protecting group (Scheme 1). In addition, the one-pot
synthesis of several N-substituted dihydroquinoxalin-2-ones was studied
under the present catalytic conditions, providing an exceptional and
mild synthetic approach based on the reported chemoselective transfer
hydrogenation process of the multifunctional nitro precursors (Scheme 1).

The present catalytic protocol is timely and of high interest
as
it has a selective and sustainable synthetic character permitting
further diversification of the synthesized MCR libraries and giving
access to multifunctional amines and dihydroquinoxalinones.

Results
and Discussion
In this work, three variants of one of the
most well-known isocyanide-based
MCRs12,13,23 were employed;
such as the Ugi-Smiles,24−26 the Ugi-tetrazole (UT-4CR),27−33 and the classical Ugi reaction (U-4CR).32,34,35 We highly diversified the aforementioned
reactions including a variety of functional groups (their synthetic
schemes are presented in detail in Supporting Information). For the catalytic reductions, we employed commercially
available supported AuNPs Au/TiO2, as well as the salts
AgNO3 and AgOTf and the synthesized mesoporous catalysts
Ag/TiO2 and Ag/HMS.21,22 The commercial catalyst
Au/TiO2 features a ca. 1 wt % Au loading and exhibits an
average AuNP size of about 2–3 nm. Mesoporous Ag/TiO2 composite with an AgNP loading amount of 4 wt % and an average size
of about 4–7 nm was prepared by photochemical deposition of
AgNPs on the surface of NP-based mesoporous titania.21 Also, Ag/HMS with AgNP loading amounts of 10, 30, and 50
wt % and the size of particles ranged between 15 and 30 nm (Table S1) were synthesized by the in situ deposition/reduction
with a mixture of ethanolamine and ethylenediamine, described in details
in our previous work on the selective reduction of azines to benzyl
hydrazones.22 For selected transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images,
see also Supporting Information (Figure
S1).

The reduction of nitro multifunctional derivative 1 toward the corresponding amine 1a was initially
investigated
in order to optimize the reaction conditions, using supported AgNPs
as the catalyst, different hydrides, solvents, and catalysts (Table 1). Under the present
conditions described below, the common reducing agents NaBH4, LiAlH4, and NaH were found to be inactive in the absence
of catalyst (Table 1, entries 1–4); furthermore, degradation products (cleavage
of the tert-amide of the anisole group) were observed
by the 1H NMR of the crude mixtures in the two latter cases.
In addition, the presence of only 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl disiloxane (TMDS)
does not lead to any reduction process (Table 1, entry 5).

d Equimolar amount of the reducing

e All the

%.

To our delight, NaBH4 and TMDS in the presence of Au/TiO2, using an
equimolar mixture of solvents THF/MeOH or only
MeOH, provided an efficient reduction, Table 1, entries 6–8). In addition, Ag NPs
(Ag/TiO2) were found to catalyze the quantitative formation
of the corresponding amine 1a using NaBH4 as
the reducing agent (Table 1, entries 9 and 10). However, for better solubility of the
starting material, we continue our further screening tests with the
equimolar mixture of THF/MeOH. To compare the catalytic activity of
the present synthesized Ag/HMS catalysts, we studied the reduction
of 1, with Ag/HMS (x), (x = 10, 30, and 50%), catalysts in the presence of NaBH4 and the equimolar mixture of methanol/THF as solvent. All catalysts
found to lead the transfer hydrogenation process to completion in
a fast and clean manner, in high isolated yield >95%, without the
requirement of any chromatographic purification of the product 1a (Table 1, entries 11–17). The Ag/HMS (10) and the Ag/HMS (30) catalysts,
with an average of AgNP size below 20 nm, showed the best catalytic
activity in terms of the conversion and selectivity of 1a in the presence of two equivalents of NaBH4 (Table 1, entries 12 and 16).
This result supports a high relationship between the silver loading
amount and the Ag particle size with the reaction selectivity toward 1. In comparison, yields dramatically decreased when an equimolar
amount of NaBH4 was used (Table 1, entry 13); however in the absence of AgNPs
(HMS) no conversion of 1 to 1a was observed
(Table 1, entry 18).
On the other hand, in the presence of hydrosilanes TMDS and Et3SiH, no reactions occurred (Table 1, entries 14 and 15). Finally, the presence
of AgNO3 and AgOTf salts leads to the significant formation
of 1a in 98 and 93% isolated yields, although 20 mol
% was used in each case (Table 1, entries 19 and 20). These findings suggest that AgNPs with
the size of <15 nm were found to catalyze the reduction process
in the presence of NaBH4, within short reaction time and
under mild conditions, results that are in good agreement with previous
studies.21,22 On the basis of these findings, herein we
attempt to combine—for the first time—the application
of this simple catalytic system in the highly diverse and complex
environment of the MCR chemical space, without the need of a protecting
group, as well as into the facile one-pot synthesis of substituted
3,4-dihydroquinoxalinones, molecules with significant biological activity.

In order to determine if the present examined catalytic reduction
processes can also be applicable to a variety of multifunctional nitro
compounds, different starting materials were synthesized 1–7 and 8–10 and tested under the above two catalytic
system, the Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4 (Scheme 2). To our surprise, the corresponding amine derivatives 1a–10a were formed as the only product, in high conversions (92–98%,
based on nitro consumption, results not shown) as measured by 1H NMR from the crude reduction mixture and isolated yields
in 84–95%, as shown in Scheme 2 (values in parentheses corresponds to the isolated
yields under the Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4 catalytic system).
Interestingly, not only amide bonds but also other easily reducible
moieties as chloro, aldehyde, or methyl ketone under the present conditions
remained intact. These results support unambiguously the high catalytic
activity of the used catalytic system Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4 toward the chemoselective reduction of such multifunctional nitro
derivatives to the corresponding amines.

Transfer Hydrogenation Processes toward the Synthesis
of Amine-Substituted MCR Scaffolds and Dihydroquinoxalinone Derivatives
Scheme 2 Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4 Catalyzed Chemoselective Reduction
of the Multifunctional Nitro Compounds 1–10 Synthesized
by the Ugi-Smiles and Ugi-4C Reactions
On the basis of this outcome, the present research was
extended
to more complicated multifunctional nitro derivatives, such as substituted
tetrazoles (11–20), bearing also the corresponding
methylesters of the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, leucine,
and valine for example compounds 16–20 (Scheme 3). Remarkably, the
reduction processes using the Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4 do
not affect either the chemical functionality of the tetrazole ring
or the chloro and methyl ester groups, giving the corresponding multifunctional
amines (11a–20a) as the only products in high
isolated yields (86–94%) and selectivity (>99%), after short
reaction time (1–3 h). The measured diastereoselectivity (dr)
of the amines 18a–20a corresponds to the initial
ratio of the corresponding starting nitro compounds 18–20, as observed by 1H NMR (see Supporting Information). These results support further the high activity
and chemoselectivity of the present catalytic system toward the nitro
group reduction of a series of multifunctional biological active molecules,
a facile and useful procedure plausibly applicable for a multi-gram-scale
synthesis.

Scheme 3 Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4-Catalyzed Chemoselective
Reduction
of the Nitro Multifunctional Tetrazoles 11–15 and
Amino Acid-Functionalized Derivatives 16–20
The synthetic value of the
present reductive catalytic systems
was verified by performing a one-pot C–N cyclization reaction
of the in situ formed ortho-amino derivatives 21a–27a, forming a series of novel dihydroquinoxalin-2-ones
(21b–27b, Scheme 4). Dihydroquinoxalino-2-ones are present in many bioactive
compounds with anticancer36−38 and anti-inflammatory39 properties, as well as against neurological
diseases.40 There are mainly three different
synthetic approaches; the majority of the dihydroquinaxolinone derivatives
is accessed through an o-halogen substituted nitro
or aniline phenyl group and its subsequent reaction with amino acids37,39,41,42 or the reduction of quinoxaline derivatives through a transition
metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation43−45 (Scheme 1). The aforementioned processes
involve, on average, more than three sequential steps, protecting
groups, Lewis acids and in many cases expensive starting materials.
In addition to these two methods, few examples have been described
in the literature with different approaches for example reactions
of o-phenylenodiamine (oPDM) toward
dihydroquinoxaline derivatives.35,36 Herein, a mild and
efficient retrosynthetic scheme is proposed based on the above heterogeneous
catalytic systems including the one-pot ring closing pathway of the
in situ formed amine derivative (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 One-Pot Synthesis of Dihydroquinoxalin-2-ones
(21b–27b) Using the Ag/HMS Heterogeneous Transfer
Hydrogenation Catalytic
Processes
Thus, the Ag/HMS(10)–NaBH4-catalyzed transfer
hydrogenation process of the ortho-nitro substituted
multifunctional compounds performed toward to the corresponding amines
(21a–27a) in 0.2 mmol reaction scale. In all cases,
a direct formation of the corresponding cyclized products dihydroquinoxalino-2-one
(21b–27b), through an intramolecular transamidation
pathway (intramolecular C–N cyclization process), was observed
by thin layer chromatography (TLC). It is worth noting that during
the reaction pathway, a mixture mainly containing the cyclic and the
starting amine was determined by 1H NMR of the crude reaction
mixture (see Figure S2). It is also worth
noting that this pathway was observed when the methyl carbamate group
existed in the starting material structure (21–27), which is eliminated as glycine methyl ester (a good living group)
under the intramolecular nucleophilic pathway. Finally, high isolated
yields were measured in all cases (89–96%) within a reaction
time ranged between 5 and 12 h, results that support the clean and
mild efficacy of the later heterogeneous catalytic process.

The observed retrosynthetic scenario is based on the facile MCR
synthesis of the starting nitro compound by an Ugi-Smiles reaction
of the readily available o-nitrophenols, amines,
aldehydes, and glycine methyl ester isocyanide in high yields (Scheme 4). The subsequently
catalytic results shown in Scheme 4 indicated that the corresponding cyclized products
(21b–27b) were formed in good to high isolated
yields. This spontaneous in situ reduction-cyclization pathway occurred
within short reaction time and under ambient conditions supports further
the synthetic value of the present transfer hydrogenation reactions
using Ag/HMS–NaBH4 as the heterogeneous catalytic
systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is a study in the literature
reported on the Ugi-Smiles adduct transformation to the quinoxaline
derivatives under hydrogenation conditions with Pd/C (10 mol %) as
the catalyst and acidic conditions using p-toluenesulfonic
acid.46 In all cases, prolonged reaction
times and multistep workup protocols were required until the final
product isolation; compared to the present heterogeneous, fast, mild,
and lab-scale transfer hydrogenation process is catalyzed by AgNPs.

On the basis of these results, the Ag/HMS–NaBH4 catalytic system was further tested for possible lab-scale production
of dihydroquinoxalino-2-ones from the corresponding multicomponent
amines. For this reason, 1 mmol of the nitro derivative 22 was reduced in the presence of Ag/HMS 10% wt (20 mg, 1.8 mol %)
with 2 mmol of NaBH4 in 6 mL MeOH/THF = 1:1. After completion
of the reduction (ca. 120 min based on TLC analysis), 50 mg of silica
gel was added into the reaction mixture and left under stirring for
appropriate time (monitored by TLC) to afford the corresponding cyclized
product 22b. After that, the mixture was filtered and
the filtrate was evaporated under vacuum to afford, after chromatographic
purification (see Experimental Section), the
corresponding dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-one derivative 22b in pure forms with 78% isolated yield based on the corresponding
nitro amount. This result corresponds to a high turnover number of
43, as measured from the ratio of product 22b (mmol)/supported
Ag/HMS (mmol).

Moreover, our synthesis gives an easy access
to inhibitors of the
soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), an important target for therapies
against hypertension or inflammation; demonstrating this potential,
derivatives 21b and 22b were designed and
accordingly synthesized with our protocol based on the cocrystalized
compound 28 (PDB ID 3WKB), which was identified as a potent fragment
(IC50 = 61 μM, LE = 0.32) of the aforementioned enzyme
inhibition (Figure 1).38 To our delight, this is the first
example in the literature that describes the synthesis in the lab
scale of such heterocyclic molecules based on the present gold- or
silver-based heterogeneous catalytic conditions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that silica-supported
AgNPs
can be applied to more complicated organic compounds, containing the
highly diverse and complex environment of the MCR chemical space,
and catalyze the selective reduction of a series of such multifunctional
nitro-compounds into the corresponding amines employing NaBH4 as reducing agents. Among the tested catalytic systems, the Ag/HMS(10)
with an average of AgNP size below 15 nm showed the best catalytic
activity in terms of the conversion and selectivity of the amine formation.
The catalyst was found to be highly chemoselective even for more complex
molecules such as tetrazole and amino acid-substituted derivatives.
The present Ag/HMS–NaBH4 catalytic system represents
an expeditious approach toward the production of the heterocyclic
dihydroquinoxalin-2-ones with good-to-high isolated yields, even to
larger-scale, via the one-pot ring closing pathway based on the chemoselective
reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding amine. The present
heterogeneous catalytic procedure gives an easy access to synthesize
inhibitors of the sEH for therapies against hypertension or inflammation.

Experimental
Section
General
All the solvents and reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluorochem, Acros and were used without further
purification. Thin layer chromatography was performed on silica gel
plates (0.20 mm thick, particle size 25 μm). Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectra were recorded on Agilent 500 {1H NMR
(500 MHz), 13C NMR (126 MHz)}. Chemical shifts for 1H NMR were reported as δ values and coupling constants
were in hertz (Hz). The following abbreviations were used for spin
multiplicity: s = singlet, br s = broad singlet, d = doublet, t =
triplet, q = quartet, quin = quintet, dd = double of doublets, ddd
= double doublet of doublets, m = multiplet. Mass spectra (HRMS) were
determined on an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS),
by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bremen, Germany) model LTQ Orbitrap
Discovery MS, at a flow rate of 10 μL/min using a syringe pump.
The infusion experiments were run using a standard ESI source operating
in a positive ionization mode. Source operating conditions were a
3.7 kV spray voltage and a 300 °C heated capillary temperature.

Preparation of Catalysts
The HMS mesoporous silica
was synthesized based on previously reported methods.47,48 Dodecylamine (DDA), which was used as the mesostructure directing
agent (template), was dissolved in ethanol followed by addition of
water in a final ratio of water/ethanol = 80:20, v/v. Tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS), used as the silica source, was then added slowly, and the
mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature followed by hydrothermal
aging in sealed PP bottles, in a shaker bath, at 65 °C for 24
h. The white product was filtered, washed with water, and dried at
room temperature and at 90 °C for 3 h. The reaction mole stoichiometry
was 1TEOS/0.23DDA/9.0EtOH/95H2O. The organic template was
removed from the dried as-synthesized samples by calcination at 600
°C for 4 h in air.

The metallic silver (Ag0)-supported
catalysts were prepared by the method using amines as reductants.
The precursor silver compound was as-synthesized silver oxalate (from
AgNO3 and oxalic acid), which was solubilized in aqueous
solution of ethylenediamine (65 vol %). The amount of silver oxalate
was adjusted so that the final silver loading of the catalysts to
be 10, 30, or 50 wt % Ag/HMS. Aqueous solution of ethanolamine was
then added to the ethylene diamine solution, followed by addition
of HMS silica under continuous stirring at room temperature. The molar
ratio of ethylenediamine and ethanolamine to Ag was equal to 3 and
0.5, respectively. The suspension formed was further left under stirring
at room temperature for 1 h, after which the temperature was gradually
raised up to 120 °C under vacuum in order to induce the reduction
of silver (occurred at about 70–80 °C) and evaporate water
and most of the amines. The collected paste was dried at 100 °C
in air and was then calcined at 350 °C for 3 h in order to remove
the residual organic compounds.

Physicochemical Characterization
The Ag content of
the catalysts was determined by inductive coupled plasma–atomic
emission spectroscopy using a Plasma 400 (PerkinElmer) spectrometer,
equipped with a Cetac6000AT+ ultrasonic nebulizer. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
experiments at −196 °C were performed using an automatic
volumetric sorption analyzer (Autosorb-1MP, Quantachrome). Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu XRD
7000 diffractometer using a Cu Kα X-ray radiation operating
at 45 kV and 100 mA. TEM experiments were carried out in a JEOL 2011
high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 200
kV, with a point resolution of 0.23 nm and Cs = 1.0 mm. SEM experiments were performed on a JEOL 6300 microscope.22

a sealed tube containing the corresponding nitro-substituted compounds
(0.2 mmol) in 0.5 mL of methanol and 0.5 mL of THF, NaBH4 (0.4 mmol) and Ag/HMS, 10 % wt (1.4 mol %, 3 mg), were added. The
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for the appropriate
time. After reaction completion (monitored by TLC), the slurry was
filtered through a short pad of Celite and silica gel to withhold
the catalyst using MeOH (∼10 mL) as an eluent. The solvent
was then evaporated under vacuum, and the residue was separated by
column chromatography using silica gel and the mixture solvent hexane/EtOAc
from 10:1 to 1:1 as the eluent to give the corresponding amines 1a–27a in pure form. It is worth noting that the amines
in most cases were unstable during the chromatographic purification
procedure; for this reason, neutralized silica (with the addition
of a few drops of triethylamine in the eluent solvent mixture) was
used for the column chromatography, as well as pretreated CDCl3 with K2CO3 was used to accomplished
the NMR spectra.
