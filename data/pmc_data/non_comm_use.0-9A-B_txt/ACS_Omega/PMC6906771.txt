Palladium-catalyzed oxidative C–H halogenation and acetoxylation
reactions of S-unprotected sulfides, selectively directed by pyridinyl
groups, allows the formation of C–X bonds (X = I, Br, Cl, OAc)
by using simple halosuccinimide or phenyliodine diacetate (PIDA) oxidants.
The undesired formation of sulfoxides and/or sulfones, which are usually
observed under oxidative conditions, is fully obviated. Under the
solvent-dependent conditions that we proposed, sulfide C–H
functionalization is achieved in less than 1 h without any direct
electrophilic halogenation at the pyridine moiety. N-Directed ortho-C–H activation of aryl also facilitates dibromination
reactions which are hardly accessible with sulfone and sulfoxide counterparts
because of their higher structural rigidity. This general method gives
a straightforward access to polyhalide sulfides, without an organosulfur
reduction step or protection–deprotection sequence. Polyhalide
sulfides are valuable synthons that give a practical entry to new
constrained polyaromatic and biphenyl sulfides, including synthetically
challenging unsymmetrical examples.

Introduction
C–H functionalization is a powerful synthetic tool that
enforces more sustainable conditions for modern organic synthesis.
This general approach avoids the lengthy synthetic installation of
more reactive and expensive functional groups and as such prevents
the stoichiometric formation of undesired, sometimes toxic, byproducts.1−6 Palladium-catalyzed pyridyl-directed C–H functionalizations
have become very useful because they avoid synthetic steps and circumvent
regioselectivity issues. Despite significant progress, the oxidizing
reaction conditions that are generally reported remain poorly suitable
for substrates bearing functions that are highly sensitive to oxidation,
such as well-known sulfanyl groups.7−9 The use of sulfides in
palladium C–H oxidation is delicate because of the potential
poisoning of transition metal catalysts by strong coordination to
the sulfur atoms and due to the sulfur instability to oxidation. Thus,
under the standard oxidative C–H activation reactions most
organosulfur C–H functionalization studies have been conducted
from more robust S-protected sulfones and sulfoxides (Scheme 1a)10,11 or other highly oxidized sulfur derivatives.

Scheme 1 Pyridyl-Directed C–H Functionalization of Organosulfurs (a)
and Halogenation of Unprotected Aryl Sulfides (b)
Very recently, the Ananikov group described a single example of
palladium-catalyzed ligand-directed C–H vinylation of a pyridyl
aryl sulfanyl, in which K2S2O8 was
used as a mild oxidant and the sulfur atom was preserved from oxidation.8b A mixture of mono- and difunctionalized vinyl
aryl sulfanyl was obtained, for which the NMR yields were estimated
at 35% and 7%, respectively. Additionally, the reduction of sulfoxides12 either under stoichiometric or catalytic conditions
requires reagents such as phosphines, hydrosilanes, hydroboranes,
or thiols, sometimes in the presence of a transition metal. The reduction
of sulfones is even more challenging because of the high thermal stability
of sulfonyl groups.12a Thus, synthetic
protocols using sulfides which allow circumventing reduction of sulfoxides
or sulfones is desirable, and we developed such an approach herein
for palladium-catalyzed oxidative C–H halogenation.

Results and Discussion
Direct C–H halogenation reactions are very attractive since
organohalides are pivotal synthons in current organic synthesis.13 As a part of our program directed toward methodology
for C–H fluorination and halogenation reactions, we reported
that substrates such as tetrazines,14a,14b pyrazoles,14c and sulfones11b are
amenable to C–H oxidation with simple electrophilic succinimide
halogen sources. We envisioned that selective C–H oxidative
functionalization in the presence of oxidation-sensitive sulfides
(Scheme 1b) would be
useful for further applications in late-stage C–H functionalization
of bioactive organosulfur compounds (Scheme 2).15,16 We thus investigated
the challenging formation of o-C–H-functionalized
aryl sulfanyles as an ideal precursor for further direct formation
of polyaromatic and biphenyl sulfides.

Pyridyl Sulfide o-C–H Bromination Conditions
Screening
Palladium salts in polar solvents promote the o-C–H halogenation of 2-pyridyl sulfoxides11a and 2-pyridyl sulfones11b by using halosuccinimides. We reasoned that with the more
challenging oxidation-sensitive pyridyl aryl sulfides a suitable combination
of catalyst and a well-controlled amount of halogen oxidant might
favor C–H oxidation over sulfur oxidation. We first explored
C–H bromination of (pyridyl)-o-chloroaryl
sulfanyl 1 by using 2.5 equiv of N-bromosuccinimide
(NBS) as the oxidant and bromination agent. The use of undried solvents
led to the formation of large amounts of sulfoxide and brominated
derivative (see Figure S1, illustrating
the case of chlorobenzene). In the presence of 10 mol % of Pd(acac)2 using various solvents under strictly anhydrous conditions
(CH3NO2, toluene, PhCF3, and PhCl, Table 1, entries 1–4),
we observed a complete chemoselectivity for the formation of C–H
brominated aryl sulfanyl 1a within 1 h reaction time
at 120 °C, without any trace of sulfur oxidation. However, the
conversion was limited to 36% maximum by using chlorobenzene as solvent
(entry 4).11a,17 We then explored the best conditions
to reach in short time reactions a complete conversion. Since chlorobenzene
gave by far the best conversion and yield, it was conserved for exploring
the palladium catalyst source and amount (entries 6–9). In
the absence of palladium, little reaction occurred (entry 5), while
20 mol % of Pd(acac)2 was effective for a quantitative
conversion of 1 into 1a (entry 8). The conversion
rate was shown to be fast from 1H NMR time-resolved monitoring
(Figures S2a and S2b), with >85% conversion
after 40 min. While the use of 10 mol % of Pd limited the conversion
at 36%, further palladium content optimization lengthened reaction
time for full conversion to several hours. We assumed to conserve
fast reaction rates against metal minimization, and this also was
to reduce the residence time of sulfide in solution and the risks
of S-oxidation. Conversely, the amount of NBS was reduced to 2.0 equiv
without a decrease of 1a yield, while 1.5 equiv of NBS
limited the conversion to 55%. We used these conditions for C–H
bromination of functionalized pyridyl aryl sulfanyl substrates. Because
of the high reactivity and fast conversion observed, we first explored
oxidative C–H halogenation with o-functionalized
pyridyl sulfide to specifically achieve monofunctionalization.

o-C–H Halogenation of o-Functionalized Pyridyl Sulfide
We studied the o-bromination of aryl sulfides 1–8 in which the o-position at C6 was functionalized
with various electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups (Scheme 3). From 3-methylated
pyridyl aryl sulfides 1–5, a full
conversion into brominated products 1a–5a (99%, 1H NMR) was achieved, which tolerates the presence
of o-chloro, o-fluoro, o-trifluoromethyl, o-methoxyl, and o-methyl groups, respectively. As we previously noted for other haloarenes,14,11b workup procedures to remove excess NBS by crystallization, followed
by chlorobenzene evaporation (bp 132 °C) and chromatography,
reduced the isolated yield (see workup details in SI and Figure S3). However, in
our hands it remains the best protocol to isolate pure halogenated
compounds since several successive chromatographies were even more
detrimental for final yields.

Pyridyl Aryl Sulfides

NXS (3 equiv), 17 h. Conversion to Xn (isolated yield).

In the replacement of the electron-donating 3-methyl group on the
pyridyl moieties by hydrogens, the conversions into 6a–8a remained excellent but slightly lowered.
The formation of the presumed catalytically competent palladacycle
from nitrogen coordination to palladium (Figure S2c)14b,14c is even less favored in those
cases, but still no oxidation of the sulfur atoms occurred. Notably,
this halogenation reaction is an example for a directed C–H
oxidative functionalization proceeding through a six-membered metallacycle,
which is much less common than reactions proceeding through five-membered
metallacycles.6

Pleasingly, our protocol successfully extends to C–H iodination
reactions by using N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) in oxidative
anhydrous conditions (Scheme 3, 1b, 3b–5b),
again with fast reaction rates ranging from 1 to 2 h. In the absence
of other halogen functions, iodide aryl sulfides were in general more
easy to isolate in yields above 75%. Chlorination was also achieved,
albeit by using N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) under more
drastic conditions (3 equiv of NCS, 17 h, giving 1c, 3c, and 5c). C–H fluorination conducted
by using N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI),14 which is fully compatible with redox-sensitive
aryl tetrazines,14 resulted in the expected
C–H fluorination together with the undesired oxidation of a
sulfur atom (Figures S4).2c

Facile o-C–H Dihalogenation of Pyridyl
Sulfides
The fast C–H halogenation rate associated
with pyridyl aryl sulfide substrates prevented, in our hands, the
selective monofunctionalization of o-unsubstituted
substrates. Nevertheless, this reactivity much contrasts with slower
pyridyl N-directed ortho-C–H halogenation
reactions developed with related pyridyl aryl sulfones11b and aryl sulfoxides.11a The rigid three-dimensional hindered structure of these S-oxidized
groups likely makes o-C–H difunctionalization
reactions more difficult. We systematically found for pyridyl aryl
sulfides that the first bromination reaction is quickly followed by
a facile second halogenation (Scheme 4). We relate this fast access to dihalides—compared
to sulfones reactivity—to a lesser steric pressure at the sulfur
atom near the palladium coordination sphere. Thus, aryl sulfide 9para-functionalized at C4 with an electron-donating tert-butyl group was dibrominated to give quantitatively 9d in 1 h in the presence of 3 equiv of NBS. In the presence
of the p-chloro electron-withdrawing group on the
aryl (10), 50% conversion to 10d was achieved
in the same conditions. Quantitative dibromination was also achieved
in the absence of functional groups on the aryl sulfide to give 11d. In the presence of functional groups in the C3 meta-position of aryl sulfides, excellent conversion into 12d was achieved in the presence of the electron-donating m-methyl group, while the m-chloro analogue
was isolated only in modest 22% yield despite the 17 h reaction time
(13d). Dibromination with an unsubstituted pyridyl directing
group gave only incomplete conversion of 14d and 15d (58% and 41%, respectively) despite forcing conditions
(5 equiv of NBS, 17 h).

We extended the catalyzed C–H functionalization of pyridyl
aryl sulfides to diiodination (9e–13e, Scheme 4) with good
to excellent conversion (71–99%) and good isolated yields (56–81%).
The reactions proceeded in 2 h reaction time, making iodination a
suitable alternative to o-C–H bromination
of pyridyl aryl sulfides for further functionalization.

Extension to C–O Bond Formation and Electrophilic Aromatic
Bromination
Having shown that palladium-catalyzed oxidative
conditions are compatible with direct C–H halogenation of pyridyl
sulfides—provided that appropriate solvent is used and that
strict conditions are maintained—we examined another valuable
C–H functionalization in the presence of a stronger acetoxylation
oxidant18 (Scheme 5). This could be a priori challenging since for instance NFSI easily leads to sulfone formation.
By using phenyliodine diacetate (PIDA) in dry chlorobenzene the acetoxylation
of pyridyl aryl sulfides was achieved, pleasingly without oxidation
of the heteroatoms. With 1 equiv of PIDA, monoacetoxylation reactions
gave compounds 5f or 16f which were isolated
in 64% and 34% yield, respectively. Using 3-methylated pyridyl phenyl
sulfide, we achieved C–O bond formation to mono- and diacetoxylated
compounds 17f and 17g, respectively, by
adjusting the amount of oxidant. Here again the second C–H
functionalization quickly follows the first acetoxylation, limiting
the yield in monoacetoxylation.

Scheme 5 C–H Acetoxylation of Aryl Sulfide C–H and Alternative
Bromination
In the course of our investigations focused on the solvent influence
on sulfur oxidation, some control experiments revealed that the use
of anhydrous 1,4-dioxane, in the absence of palladium, promotes electrophilic
aromatic bromination (uncatalyzed) at the pyridyl moiety (Scheme 5, bottom).

The C–H functionalization takes places in the ortho- and para-position of the sulfur atom, which indicates
clearly a complex combination of activating electronic effects from
both the sulfur and nitrogen atoms since the more electron-rich phenyl
ring remains untouched. We checked that the corresponding pyridyl
aryl sulfone does not undergo this reaction, showing here the influence
of the nonoxidized sulfide function. This bromination of sulfanyl-functionalized
pyridines resembles electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions
reported for other heterocycles substituted with methoxy and amido
groups.19 Pyridyl bromination by NBS gives
product 18h in 79% conversion and 43% isolated yield.
When the pyridyl C3-position is not methylated, we isolated the new
dibrominated compound 14i.

Access to Polyaromatic Sulfides
Directly o-halogenated aryl sulfides allow the facile installation of aryl
groups by using the polyhalides 9d, 11d, 14d, and 1a to form in a straightforward way
valuable,15,16,20,21 highly congested polyaromatic pyridyl sulfides (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Suzuki–Miyaura Coupling of Halogenated Pyridyl Aryl Sulfides
The halogenated aryl sulfides undergo cross-coupling reaction with
aryl boronic acids to form in one step the tris(phenyl)sulfanylpyridines 19–21 with satisfactory to good isolated
yields of 41–75%. Suzuki–Miyaura coupling also efficiently
allowed the formation of the new biphenyl sulfides 22–24,21 in 41–75%
isolated yield, which are ready for further functionalization at the
carbon-chloride bond.

Conclusion
In summary, palladium oxidative pyridyl-directed selective ortho-C–H functionalization is achieved from S-unprotected
aryl pyridyl sulfides, without any sulfur oxidation, in fast reactions
(40 min, 85%), which contrast with slower analogous C–H halogenation
methods that employed S-oxidized pyridyl sulfoxides and sulfones.
This approach allows a direct C–H sulfide functionalization,
which avoids any reduction step (or protection/deprotection) of sulfoxides
and sulfones, which are challenging reactions owing to the high thermodynamic
stability of such groups. Strictly anhydrous conditions in chlorobenzene
with controlled amount of halosuccinimide source or PIDA allowed mono
and ortho-dihalogenation—previously undescribed—in
highly functionalized pyridyl aryl sulfides. Polyhalogenated aryl
sulfides are useful building blocks for synthesizing in a single step
highly congested polyaromatic or biphenyl pyridyl sulfides.

General Conditions
Reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used without purification. Unless otherwise stated,
the solvents used were anhydrous: specifically, chlorobenzene anhydrous
99.8% (Sigma-Aldrich Sure/Seal, <0.005% water) and 1,4-dioxane
extra dry 99.8% (Acros Organics AcroSeal, <0.005% water). Reactions
were performed under an argon atmosphere using vacuum-lines and Schlenk
techniques. 1H (500 MHz), 13C (126 MHz), 19F (470 MHz) NMR were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III instruments
in CDCl3 solutions. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm
relative to CDCl3 (1H: 7.26 and 13C: 77.16), and coupling constants J are given in
Hz. GC-MS experiments were performed with a Trace GC Ultra equipped
with a mass-selective detector, and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS)
were obtained on a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap XL with ESI source. Flash chromatography
was performed on silica gel (230–400 mesh) or with PuriFlash
450 from Interchim. Elemental analysis experiments were performed
on Thermo Electron Flash EA 1112 Series.

Catalytic Halogenation and Acetoxylation Reactions
As a typical experiment, thioether, the oxidant NBS (NIS, NCS, or
PIDA), and Pd(acac)2 were introduced in a Schlenk tube,
equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. Anhydrous chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich
99.8% anhydrous Sure/Seal, <0.005% water) was added, and the Schlenk
tube was purged several times with argon. The Schlenk tube was placed
in a preheated oil bath at 120 °C, and reactants were allowed
to stir for 1, 2, or 17 h. After cooling the mixture to −10
°C, a part of the recrystallized NXS reagent is filtered off
and washed with cool chlorobenzene. PhCl solvent was then removed
in vacuum, and the crude residue was purified by silica gel column
chromatography to afford the halogenated thioethers.

Catalytic Suzuki Reactions
As a typical experiment,
halogenated thioether, Pd(dba)2, PhB(OH)2, and
K2CO3 were introduced in a Schlenk tube, equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar. Dry toluene was added, and the Schlenk
tube was purged several times with argon. The Schlenk tube was placed
in a preheated oil bath at 110 °C, and reactants were allowed
to stir for 17 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction
mixture was diluted with dichloromethane and was washed three times
with water. The combined organic layers were washed with water and
dried over MgSO4. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and
the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography
to afford the products.
