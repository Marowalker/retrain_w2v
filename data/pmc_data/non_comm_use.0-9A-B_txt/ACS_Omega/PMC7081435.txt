Shale
gas has attracted increasing attention as a potential alternative
gas in recent years. Because a large fraction of gas in shale formation
is in an adsorbed state, knowledge of the supercritical methane adsorption
behavior on shales is fundamental for gas-in-place predictions and
optimum gas recovery. A practical model with rigorous physical significance
is necessary to describe the methane adsorption behavior at high pressures
and high temperatures on shales. In this study, methane adsorption
experiments were carried out on three Lower Silurian Longmaxi shale
samples from the Sichuan Basin, South China, at pressures of up to
30 MPa and temperatures of 40, 60, 80, and 100 °C. The simplified
local density/Elliott–Suresh–Donohue model was adopted
to fit the experimental data in this study and the published methane
adsorption data. The results demonstrate that this model is suitable
to represent the adsorption data from the experiments and literature
for a wide range of temperatures and pressures, and the average absolute
deviation is within 10%. The methane adsorption capacity of the Longmaxi
shale exhibited a strong linear positive correlation with the total
organic carbon content and a linear negative correlation with increasing
temperature. The rate of decrease in the methane adsorption capacity
with swing temperature increased with the total organic carbon content,
indicating that the organic matter is sensitive to temperature.

Introduction
In recent years, interest in shale gas
has grown because of the
advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques.1,2 In 2015, shale gas development accounted for 50% of natural gas
production in the United States, and this is estimated to increase
to nearly 70% in 2040.3 To meet the domestic
energy demands, China started shale gas exploration and production
in the Sichuan Basin in 2009.4 It is predicted
that shale gas may account for nearly 50% of China’s natural
gas production by 2040.3

Unlike conventional
reservoirs, shale gas itself is both the source
and the reservoir. Generally, under practical stratum conditions,
there are three types of stored shale gas: free gas in interparticle
pores and microfractures, adsorbed gas on the surfaces of organic
matter and clay minerals, and dissolved gas in kerogen and bitumen.5 Ambrose et al.6 indicated
that the percentage of adsorbed gas to the total gas in shales was
between 20 and 80%. Montgomery et al.2 pointed
out that the percentage of adsorbed gas to the total gas in place
could be as high as 50–60% in some cases. Therefore, adsorbed
gas is a large fraction in shale gas reservoirs. Consequently, it
is critical to investigate the adsorption capacity on shale for gas-in-place
assessments and gas production predictions. Additionally, knowing
the specific ratio of adsorbed gas and free gas is vital to identify
gas migration mechanisms within shale reservoirs.7,8

In recent years, many methane isothermal adsorption experiments
have been performed on shale samples. Chalmers and Bustin9 and Ross and Bustin10 examined the methane adsorption capacities in shales in British
Columbia, Canada, at 6 MPa at 30 °C. Rexer et al.11 measured the methane adsorption capacity on
Alum shale under practical geological conditions up to 14 MPa and
between 27 and 200 °C. Heller and Zoback12 measured the adsorption capacities and induced the swelling of methane
and carbon dioxide on U.S. shales and pure minerals up to 10 MPa at
40 °C. Zhang et al.13 observed methane
adsorption at 35, 50, and 65 °C and pressures of up to 15 MPa
on Eocene Green River Formation, Devonian–Mississippian Woodford
Shale, and isolated kerogen. Gasparik et al.14 examined methane sorption on organic-rich shales from Europe and
the United States at pressures up to 25 MPa and temperatures up to
150 °C on dry samples and up to 38 °C on moisture-equilibrated
samples. Merkel et al.15 performed methane
sorption experiments on lacustrine shale from Scotland that was dry
or had one of four different moisture contents at 45 °C and up
to 25 MPa. Shabani et al.16 inspected 19
dry and moisture-equilibrated shale samples between 45 and 130 °C
at pressures up to 25 MPa. The samples were collected from the Jurassic
Sargelu and the Cretaceous Garau formations in Lurestan province,
southwest Iran.

With the increasing interest in shale gas in
China, Chinese shales
have been analyzed. Tan et al.17 collected
marine black shale samples from the Upper Yangtze Platform, South
China, and tested the adsorption capabilities at pressures up to 25
MPa at 46 °C. Pan et al.18 applied
the supercritical Dubinin–Radushkevich (sD–R) model
to fit the methane adsorption data recorded at pressures up to 35
MPa for Longmaxi shales collected from southeast Chongqing, South
China. Tian et al.19 studied methane adsorption
at 35.4, 50.6, and 65.4 °C and pressures up to 15 MPa for eight
overmature Lower Silurian–Upper Ordovician shale samples collected
from the Sichuan Basin. Yang et al.20 used
the modified supercritical Dubinin–Astakhov (sD–A) model
to describe methane adsorption on Paleozoic shales from the Sichuan
Basin at temperatures ranging from 30 to 120 °C and pressures
up to 25 MPa. Wang et al.21 discussed the
influence of pore characterization on methane adsorption of shale
samples from the Upper Yangtze Platform, South China. Li et al.22 examined methane adsorption on Niutitang Shale
(Lower Cambrian) collected from northeast Guizhou Province, southwest
China, at various temperatures (40–120 °C) and pressures
(up to 35 MPa). Zhou et al.23 discussed
the density of the adsorbed phase using the sD–R model for
eight Longmaxi shale samples from the Sichuan Basin, China, at 60
°C and up to 30 MPa.

However, some of the above investigations
were carried out under
moderate pressures (≤15 MPa)9−11,13,19 or quite low temperatures (≤60
°C)9,10,12,15,17,23 compared with the actual shale reservoir conditions. Unlike coalbed
methane, which is usually deposited in shallow coal seams at depths
of less than 1000 m, shale reservoirs are generally much deeper and
under very different pressure and temperature conditions. Taking the
Lower Silurian and Lower Cambrian shales in the Sichuan Basin, southwest
China, as examples, the burial depth for industrial shale gas production
ranges from 2000 to 4000 m.24 Theoretically,
the temperature and pressure ranges of practical shale reservoirs
are 60–120 °C and 20–40 MPa, respectively, assuming
that the hydrostatic pressure gradient is 0.01 MPa/m and the normal
geothermal gradient is 3 °C/100 m. Obviously, these values are
much higher than the critical pressure (4.64 MPa) and critical temperature
(−82.5 °C).25 Therefore, methane
adsorption is supercritical under shale reservoir conditions. At relatively
low pressures, the conventional adsorption model can fit the isotherms
very well because the adsorption quantity is quite low and the volume
of the adsorbed phase is negligible. However, excess adsorption will
greatly deviate from the absolute adsorption (i.e., the actual adsorption)
under high pressures,12,25−27 and this may
result in substantial underestimation in gas-in-place and gas production
calculations. Consequently, adsorption at relatively low pressures
or low temperatures cannot represent the actual stratum conditions
of shale formations.

Most previous studies have applied the
modified Langmuir model,
sD–R model, or sD–A model to match the experimental
data. The Langmuir model is an ideal model and assumes that the adsorbate
is adsorbed on a homogeneous surface in a monolayer and ignores the
interactions between the adsorbed molecules.28 The sD–R model and its variant, the sD–A model, are
based on pore filling theory for pore diameters smaller than 2 nm,29 but numerous previous studies have revealed
that pore sizes in shale formations cover a wide range from micro
to macro.30−39 Zhou et al.40 indicated that methane
adsorption on shale involves synchronized pore filling and monolayer
adsorption. Furthermore, for supercritical liquids, the saturated
vapor pressure, which is an important parameter in the sD–R
and sD–A models, is no longer defined.41 However, the model parameters acquired from the modified Langmuir
model, sD–R model, and sD–A model are temperature-dependent.
Consequently, they can only be used to obtain adsorption isotherms
at specific temperatures and cannot be used to calculate the adsorption
capacities at other temperatures. Furthermore, the density of the
adsorption phase, which is set as a constant during model matching,
is always higher than the upper limit of the liquid-phase methane
density (424 g/m3).22,23 A recent molecular
simulation indicated that the density of the adsorption phase was
position-dependent in slit pores.42 These
phenomena indicate that the modified Langmuir model, sD–R model,
and sD–A model may be physically unreasonable and limited to
the representation of methane adsorption on shales. Therefore, a robust
model with temperature-independent parameters is needed for promoting
the understanding of supercritical methane adsorption of shales.

At this point, the simplified local density (SLD) model,43 which superimposes the fluid–solid potential
on a fluid equation of state (EOS) to represent the adsorption of
supercritical fluids in a slit, was successfully applied to describe
the adsorption behaviors of pure and mixed gases in shales, coals,
and active carbons44,45 over wide ranges of pressure
and temperature. The SLD model is a thermodynamic method with only
two temperature-independent undetermined parameters.46 Furthermore, Pan and Connell47 proposed the SLD model with a swelling model to predict the adsorption-induced
swelling of coals. The Elliott–Suresh–Donohue (ESD)
EOS48 is a simple model consisting of attractive
and repulsive terms and takes shape factors into consideration. Consequently,
the ESD equation can more accurately represent interactions than the
Peng–Robinson equation.49 Therefore,
the SLD model with the ESD equation provides specific advantages for
a wide range of adsorption-related phenomena for adsorption and formation
on organic rocks.

The aim of the present research was to perform
methane adsorption
on Longmaxi shales under high pressures (up to 30 MPa) and high temperatures
(up to 100 °C). Experimental data were acquired using a magnetic
suspension balance (gravimetric method). In addition, we attempted
to use the SLD/ESD model to fit the adsorption isotherms. Furthermore,
methane adsorption data on shales in the literature were selected
to test the viability of the SLD/ESD model to represent the adsorption
behavior on different shales.

Materials and Methods
Samples and Geological
Details
Three samples were collected
from the Longmaxi Formation in the Sichuan Basin, southwest China.
The lower Silurian Longmaxi marine shale formation in the Weiyuan–Changning
area is dominated by black carbonaceous shales with a stable thickness
of 26–50 m. The total organic carbon (TOC) content ranges from
1.9 to 7.3% and the vitrinite reflectance ranges from 2.3 to 2.8%.50 Fresh samples were collected and sealed for
preservation in the laboratory. Samples NY09 and NY21 were drilled
from wells and Sample NY17 was drilled from an outcrop. The well location
is not disclosed because of confidentiality reasons.

Mineralogy
and Organic Petrography
To determine the
TOC contents, the samples were crushed to 60–80 mesh. A sample
(10 g) of each powder was immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid to
remove carbonates. After the acid was drained from the samples, the
samples were dried overnight at 65 °C. Subsequently, the TOC
contents were measured using a carbon/sulfur analyzer (CS-244; Leco,
St. Joseph, SI, USA).

Maturity is generally estimated by vitrinite
reflectance. Because of the lack of vitrinite in marine shales, we
took Tmax from Rock-Eval pyrolysis using
the equation R0 = 0.0149 × Tmax – 5.85 to approximate the vitrinite
reflectance.51

X-ray diffraction
was used to determine the relative mineral percentages
of the shale samples. Powdered samples with the same grain size as
for the TOC measurements were inspected using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE
diffractometer with Cu Kα X-rays (1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and
40 mA. The 2θ scan range was 3–45° with a step size
of 0.02° and an increased rate of 2°/min.

Low-Pressure
N2 Adsorption/Desorption
To
investigate the pore structure and pore size distributions of the
samples, low-pressure N2 adsorption/desorption at −196.15
°C with a relative pressure (P/P0) between 0.01 and 0.995 was conducted on a porosimetry
system (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics Instruments). Each sample was crushed
and sieved to a mesh size of 60–80 and then outgassed at 110
°C for 24 h to remove bound water and residual gases. The N2 adsorption data between P/P0 = 0.05 and 0.35 were selected to calculate the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area, SBET,(52) and the total pore volume was obtained at a
relative pressure of 0.995. The average pore diameter was derived
from 4 V/SBET, and the micropore volume
(<2 nm) was calculated by the t-plot method.53

High-Pressure Methane Adsorption
Methane excess sorption
isotherms were run on dry samples with a gravimetric adsorption/desorption
setup (ISOSORP-HP; Rubotherm, Germany) at pressures up to 30 MPa and
temperatures of 40, 60, 80, and 100 °C. The core unit was a magnetic
suspension balance with a precision of 0.01 °C for the temperature,
0.01 bar (1 kPa) for the pressure, and 0.01 mg for the mass. The maximum
test temperature and pressure were 150 °C and 35 MPa, respectively.
To measure the adsorption isotherms, high-purity methane (99.99%)
was injected by an ISCO pump into the pressure chamber, and the change
in mass in the chamber was determined directly by the magnetic suspension
balance.

The methane excess adsorption experiments were performed
on crushed samples with grain sizes between 60 and 80 mesh. Crushing
of samples can minimize the time required to reach equilibrium in
a tight rock with extremely low permeability.54 Approximately 5 g of the crushed sample was used for each test.
To remove the residual gas and moisture, the crushed samples were
placed in the sample chamber before adsorption at 110 °C under
approximately 0.01 atmospheric pressure until a constant mass was
achieved. The equilibrium time for each pressure was set to 2 h. To
evaluate the experimental repeatability, the isothermal measurement
was repeated at 60 °C for each sample.

Briefly, the experimental
system employs the conservation of mass
as follows 1  where m is the mass
recorded
by the magnetic suspension balance, mabs is the mass of the adsorbed phase, mc is the mass of the sample container, ms is the mass of the shale powder, Vc is
the volume of the sample container, Vs is the volume of the shale powder, Va is the volume of the adsorbed phase, and ρg is
the density of the bulk phase. Currently, both mabs and Va are immeasurable in eq 1. According to the definition
of Gibbs excess adsorption,55 the excess
adsorption amount (mex) can be calculated
at a given temperature and pressure using the following equation 2  where ρa is the density of
the adsorbed phase.

Combination of eqs 1 and 2 gives the following
equation 3  

Obviously, all the parameters
on the right side of eq 3 can be measured experimentally
or calculated directly from the EOS. If either the density of the
adsorbed phase (ρa) or the volume of the adsorbed
phase (Va) is known, the absolute adsorption
can be written as follows 4  

Theory of the SLD/ESD Model
The SLD model can describe
the adsorption and desorption of pure and mixed gases over a large
pressure range. It assumes that the adsorbate molecules reside in
a rectangular shaped slit and are located between the two surfaces
of the slit (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the slit geometry.

The width between the two surfaces is L, and the
perpendicular distance between the adsorbate and the surface is z. The adsorbate interacts with the two surfaces of the
slit and the molecules in the bulk phase. At equilibrium, the SLD
model assumes that the chemical potential of the bulk phase (ubulk) equal to the chemical potential of the
adsorbate molecule (u(z)) at any
point z is expressed as the sum of the fluid–fluid
potential and fluid–solid potential as follows 5  where the subscript “bulk” means
the bulk phase, and ff and fs signify fluid–fluid and fluid–solid
interactions, respectively.

The chemical potential of the bulk
phase can also be written in
terms of fugacity as follows 6  where u0(T) designates the chemical potential of an arbitrary reference
state, and f0 represents the fugacity
of the reference state.

For the fluid–fluid interaction,
the chemical potential
can be derived using a similar equation 7  where fff(z) is the fugacity of the fluid at an arbitrary
position z.

For the interaction between the
fluid and the slit wall, the chemical
potential can be written as 8  where NA is Avogadro’s
number, and ψfs(z) and ψfs(L – z) are the
interaction potentials for a single fluid molecule with the two surfaces
of a slit with width L.

Substituting eqs 6–8 into eq 5 provides
the fugacity of the fluid–fluid interaction at an arbitrary
position (z) under equilibrium 9  where k is the Boltzmann
constant. The fluid–solid interaction is an attractive force,
which means ψfs(z) and ψfs(L – z) are negative,
and the fugacity of the adsorbed phase is higher than the fugacity
of the bulk phase.43

The fluid–solid
interaction for a single methane molecule,
ψfs(z), is described by the Lennard-Jones
10–4 potential.56 10   11  where ρ is the number of molecules per
unit area of the slit, which is given by ρ = 0.382 atoms/Å2; εfs and εss are the fluid–solid
and solid–solid interaction energy parameters, respectively;
and σff and σss represent the molecular
diameter of the adsorbate and the carbon interplanar distance of the
organic matter, respectively. We set σss to 0.335
nm as this is the value of graphite57 and
obtained the values of σff and εff from the literature.58 The fluid–solid
molecular diameter σfs and the fictitious coordinate z′ for the following numerical integration are defined
as 12   13  

The fugacity of the bulk phase, fbulk, is calculated by the EOS.

The fugacity of the bulk fluid
can be represented in the ESD EOS48 14   15   16  where Z is the compressibility
factor for the nonideal gas; Zrep and Zattr represent the compressibility factor of
the repulsive term and attractive term, respectively; c is the shape factor of the repulsive term; q is
the shape factor of the attractive term; η is the reduced density
given by η = bρff(z), where b is the component’s size
parameter and ρff(z) is the molar
local density; and Y is the temperature-dependent
attractive energy parameter given by eq 17. 17  

Then, the
fugacity of the bulk fluid fff(z) can be represented as follows59 18  where V is the molar volume, T is the temperature,
and R is the ideal
gas constant.

As shown in Figure 1, the methane molecules are adsorbed close to the inner
surface of
the slit wall, and the intermolecular stress potential and the assembled
shape of the pores are related to the pore positions. A previous study60 gave a lower limit in the integration of 3/8σff and an upper limit of L – 3/8σff. The local density is treated as zero for distances less
than 3/8σff from the wall. The value 3/8σff is chosen to account for most of the adsorbed gas. The excess
adsorption is defined as the excess number of moles per unit mass
of the adsorbent 19  where ρ(z) is the molar density of the fluid at distance z perpendicular from the surface of the wall; ρbulk is the bulk density of the fluid, which is far from the wall; and
the fluid–solid potential is zero. At a given temperature and
pressure, we can only obtain the fugacity and density distribution
in the slit. Consequently, there are no multiple solutions for the
excess adsorption from the SLD model. Subsequently, the absolute adsorption
can be derived by the Gibbs definition 20  

In this SLD model, there are two regression
parameters: the width
of the slit L and the fluid–solid interaction
energy parameter εfs.

The density distribution
of the adsorbed phase and the excess adsorption
in the slit during the equilibrium can be calculated by the following
steps:61(1) At a given bulk pressure (P) and temperature (T), the density of
the bulk phase ρbulk and the fugacity of the bulk
phase fbulk can be obtained from the EOS.

(3) By using the Lennard-Jones
10–4
potential (eqs 10),
ψfs(z) is calculated, and the chemical
potential ufs(z) will
be obtained from eq 8. From eq 6, we can
get the chemical potential of the bulk phase ubulk; then, by solving eq 5, the fluid–fluid potential uff(z) will be calculated.

(4) Eq 9 will be used to evaluate the fugacity of the fluid–fluid fff(z).

(5) When solving eq 18, we can get the local density ρff(z) which is equal to the density of the
adsorption phase ρ(z).

(6) The adsorbed density distribution
and the excess adsorption in eq 19 can be easily calculated.



Results and Discussion
Mineralogy and Organic Petrography
The three samples
in this study displayed a TOC range of 1.54–6.13% (Table 1). During the burial
and maturation of organic matter, myriad organic pores are generated,
and these are the most important sites for gas adsorption. The XRD
results showed the mineral composition of the Longmaxi Formation in
the Sichuan Basin that was dominated by siliceous minerals (quartz,
K-feldspar, and plagioclase), clay minerals (kaoline, chlorite, illite,
and illite–semectite mixture), and carbonatite (calcite and
dolomite). The percentage of siliceous minerals ranged from 46.5 to
62.8%. The most abundant siliceous mineral was quartz, with the content
range from 35.0 to 57.6%. The carbonatite content of the samples ranged
from 6.5 to 38.7%. All the samples contained a minor pyrite with the
content between 1.5 and 6.7%, indicating a reducing depositional environment.
The equivalent vitrinite reflectance of the Longmaxi Formation shales
varied from 1.3 to 2.3%. This illustrates that the thermal maturities
of sample NY09 and sample NY21 are at the overmature stage (R0 > 2.0%) and sample NY17 is at the mature
stage.
The thermal maturity parameters suggest that the Longmaxi Formation
in the study area is in the gas generation window (1.0% < R0 < 3.0%;

Quantitative
Analyses of Pore Morphology
The isotherms
of low-pressure N2 adsorption and desorption at −196.15
°C for the Longmaxi shales are presented in Figure 2. According to the International
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classification system, all the
low-pressure nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of the samples
are type II isotherms.62 These types of
isotherms are typical for mesoporous materials and indicate pore filling
of micropores at low relative pressures and multilayer adsorption
at moderate pressures.63 All the isotherms
show H3-type adsorption hysteresis, which suggests that slit-shaped
pores are the predominant pore types.64 When the relative pressure is close to 1, the sharp increase in
the amount adsorbed implies the presence of macropores. The pore parameters
for N2 adsorption and desorption are illustrated in Table 2. The BET specific
surface areas of all three samples were in the range 14.07–23.61
m2/g; the total pore volume range was 20.246–29.816
cm3/kg; and the average pore diameters were in the mesopore
range and between 4.995 and 5.755 nm. The pore diameter distribution
was derived from the desorption branch of the N2 isotherms
using the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT).34 All the samples exhibited broad pore diameter ranges, with
the majority of pores between 1 and 100 nm Figure 3.

Methane Adsorption Isotherms
and Data Fitting
Excess
methane adsorption measurements for the three shale samples collected
from the Sichuan Basin, southwest China, were conducted using a magnetic
suspension balance and the gravimetric method. Good repeatability
of the adsorption measurements was observed with agreement between
the two runs performed for each sample at 60 °C (Figure 4), indicating that the experimental
process is precise and there is no change in the pore size distribution.
In Figure 5, the dots
represent the experimental data, and the curves give the fitting results
of the SLD/ESD model. All of the excess adsorption isotherms measured
in this study increased rapidly with increasing pressure up to a maximum
and then showed a slight decline in the excess adsorbed amount at
higher pressures. This phenomenon has been widely observed by other
authors in both experiments65 and molecular
simulations.66 It is clear that the absolute
adsorption, mabs, is a monotonic increasing
function of pressure. However, because of the differences between mabs and Vaρg, Vaρg may increase
faster than mabs at high pressures.67

Figure 4 Repeatability tests for the three shale samples at 60
°C.

Figure 5 Measured and fitted methane excess adsorption
isotherms for sample
NY09 (a), sample NY17 (b), and sample NY21 (c) at different temperatures.

In the pressure ranges used in this study, the
isotherms did not
intersect, but the differences between the isotherms at high pressures
were not distinct in all cases. They may intersect with each other
at higher pressures, that is, exhibit high excess adsorption at high
temperatures. The pressure ranges corresponding to the maximum value
of the excess amount were 10.5–12.3 MPa at 40 °C, 10.5–14
MPa at 60 °C, and 12.3–16 MPa at both 80 and 100 °C.
All fitting was conducted by the synchronized optimization of the
fit for all the experimental data for a given sample at different
temperatures through the adjustment of two parameters, L and εfs. The adjustable parameters used in this
study to fit the isotherms are summarized in Table 3. It should be noted that all the specific
surface areas, A, in this study and in the literature
were directly determined using the BET equation based on the N2 adsorption/desorption method. By contrast, some authors have
taken the specific surface area as a regressed parameter depending
on the adsorbed gas.44,68 The model shows good consistency
for the representation of the temperature dependence of the adsorption
isotherms without any temperature-dependent parameter. Here, we used
the average absolute deviation (% AAD, eq 21) to evaluate the model and experimental
data. 21  where ncal is

Literature Data
We complied an adsorption database
(Table 3) for gas adsorption
measurements on shales using data from previous publications with
different pressures, temperatures, BET specific surface areas, and
TOC contents. The data were collected from a number of sources.

Table 3 also shows
the slit length (L), solid–solid interaction
energy (εfs), and % AAD. Selected isotherms and model
fitting are shown in Figures 6–9. From the information in Table 3 and Figures 6–9, it is obvious that
the SLD/ESD model can describe the excess adsorption data from the
experiments in this study and the literature within experimental uncertainties.
In this study, the SLD/ESD model can represent the experimental isotherm
data with a % AAD lower than 5%. The regression parameter L in the SLD model ranges from 1.29 to 1.63 nm, which shows
good consistency on the same order as that of low-pressure N2 adsorption examination and an imaging method. For the regression
parameter εfs, which represents the solid–gas
interaction, there is a wide range from 53 K (NY09, this study) to
145 K (FC-49, Li et al. 2017). It shows a large deviation for the
value (70.61 K) estimated by the Lorentz–Berthelot combination
rule (), where εss/k is the solid–solid
interaction parameter49 (using 28 K for
carbon atoms and 178.082 K for methane).
The Lorentz–Berthelot combination rule can only describe the
interaction roughly and is best suited to gas molecules with simple
structures. In the SLD model, the fluid–solid energy parameter,
εfs/k, is a geometric mean of εss/k and εff/k. As the fluid–fluid interaction energy parameter for methane
is fixed (178.082 K) and independent of the adsorbent, higher values
of εss/k signify stronger fluid–solid
interactions. Additionally, the deviation between εfs and the value from the Lorentz–Berthelot combination rule
may reveal that organic matter is not the only contributor to the
adsorption process, but other minerals can also provide adsorption
sites for methane.

Influence of the TOC Content and Specific Surface Area on the
Adsorption Capacities
As illustrated in Figure 10, all the maximum excess adsorbed
amounts for the samples in this study and the samples from the literature
showed large linear positive correlations with the TOC content, indicating
that organic matter is the main carrier of adsorbed methane molecules.
This can be elucidated from two aspects. First, abundant micro- and
mesopores are widely observed in organic matter by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM),69 focused ion beam SEM (FIB-SEM), low-pressure N2 adsorption/desorption
tests,39 and small-angle neutron scattering.70 Abundant micro- and mesopores provide large
specific surface areas and numerous sorption sites for methane molecules.
Because of the higher density of the adsorbed phase, micropores and
fine mesopores have much higher adsorption potentials than large mesopores
and macropores. At the beginning of the adsorption process, the methane
molecules occupy sites with higher potentials. Second, as a nonpolar
gas, methane molecules are preferentially attracted by hydrophobic
organic matter rather than hydrophilic minerals. All the intercepts
of the regression lines in Figure 10 are nonzero, demonstrating that the minerals, especially
montmorillonite and the illite–smectite mixed mineral, can
adsorb methane.71

Figure 10 Plots of maximum adsorption
capacities versus the TOC content:
(a) data from this study, (b,c) literature data.

Excess adsorption capacities from the literature show good linear
positive correlations with the specific surface area. Generally, the
specific surface areas of shales are mainly determined by micropores,
and a high specific surface area means that the organic matter contains
a substantial number of nanopores. Therefore, shale samples exhibit
similar tendencies to the TOC contents, and their adsorption capacities
increase with increasing specific surface area. However, the data
in this study did not show good linear correlations (R2 = 0.47), and this was mainly because the number of samples
was limited (n = 3; Figure 11.

Figure 11 Maximum adsorption capacities versus the BET
surface area.

Influence of Temperature
on the Methane Adsorption Capacity
To examine the temperature
dependence of the methane adsorption
capacity on shale samples, the isotherms were measured at different
temperatures for all the samples. The entire shale samples showed
that the adsorption capacity decreased at high temperatures under
isobaric conditions as adsorption was an exothermic process. The maximum
adsorption showed a strong linear correlation (R2 > 0.99) with the reciprocal of the absolute temperature.
Similar phenomena have been observed by many other authors.11,18,22,72 The correlations between the gas adsorption capacity and the rate
of decrease were in the following order: sample NY21 > NY17 >
sample
NY09 (Figure 12).
The slope of the fitted straight line, which could be considered as
the rate of decrease of the methane adsorption capacity with increasing
temperature, increased with the TOC content of the shale sample. A
plot of the decrease rate versus the TOC content (%) showed good linear
correlations, which indicated that the TOC content was sensitive to
the increasing temperature (Figure 13).

and the
maximum excess adsorption capacity.

between the decrease in adsorption capacity and the
TOC content.

Numerous publications have already
demonstrated that when organic
matter is warmed to the glass-transition temperature (Tg), its molecules have abundant freedom of motion to reorganize.73 Consequently, high temperatures may change the
structure of the organic matter. By contrast, the isosteric heat of
adsorption is believed to be independent of temperature74 when only taking the interaction between the
gas and the sample matrix into consideration. Additionally, when methane
is adsorbed on the shale surface, there are two kinds of molecular
interactions affecting the adsorption capacity. Namely, there is the
adsorbent/adsorbate interaction and the adsorbate/adsorbate interaction.
The adsorbate/adsorbate interaction has been ignored in all previous
investigations. Theoretically, the isosteric heat of methane adsorption
will remain constant with increasing temperature if only the adsorbent/adsorbate
interaction is considered.75 The discrepancy
with the experimental data indicates that the adsorbate/adsorbate
interaction, including the adsorbed phase and bulk phase, may greatly
affect the adsorption capacity of methane. Otherwise, increasing the
temperature can enhance the process of adsorption–desorption
of methane and lead to a greater ratio of free gas molecules. Notably,
adsorption is a dynamic equilibrium process, and the residence time
for an adsorbed molecule on the surface is shorter at higher temperatures
than at lower temperatures because of higher kinetic energy. Ye et
al. pointed out that some weak adsorption sites may lose the methane
molecules when increasing the temperature because of the heterogeneity
distribution of the shale surface.76 The
grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the density of
adsorbed methane decreased with increasing temperature.77 Subsequently, the macroscopic measurement of
excess adsorption at high temperatures decreases.

Deviation Analysis
of the ESD-SLD Model and Experimental Data
Figure 14 presents
the percentage deviations for adsorption data from selected samples. Figure 14a shows the deviations
calculated for adsorption data from the three samples in this study,
and Figure 14b,c shows
the percentage deviations for adsorption data from the studies of
Li et al.22 at 60 °C, Rexer et al.,11 2013, and Tian et al.,19 2016 and that for the sample CN22 from Yang et al.20 Overall, 89.3% of all the adsorption data were predicted
with deviations of less than 10%. Obviously, no matter the temperature,
at relatively low pressures, the percentage deviations were much higher
(e.g., up to 38.4% for the sample FC-72, from Li et al., 2017) than
those at relatively high pressures. This is because of the low quantity
of excess adsorption at relatively low pressures, and any small deviation
in the predicted data may lead to a large deviation. Furthermore,
methane molecules are adsorbed at active sites with a high adsorption
potential; so, the adsorption data at low pressures are more sensitive
to the potential distribution of the adsorbent. Because pores are
the main adsorption sites for methane molecules, the pore size distribution
of the organic matter is critical to the adsorption potential. As
mentioned above, the pore size distributions for shale samples were
wide (1–100 nm) in this study and showed multimodal distributions
in the NLDFT pore size distribution and other studies.34,38,39 By contrast, in the SLD model,
there is only one parameter for the slit length, L, to represent the pore size distribution. Consequently, the SLD
model cannot predict the adsorption data accurately at relatively
low pressures. Some authors have proposed an adjustable parameter
as a coefficient for the pore size distribution. This may not only
increase the accuracy of the model but also greatly increase the calculation
effort.

Furthermore, a notable tendency was observed in the percentage
deviations over large pressure ranges. For most data measured at different
temperatures, the percentage deviations were negative in moderate
pressure ranges and positive in high pressure ranges. This suggests
that the SLD/ESD model underestimates excess adsorption at moderate
pressures, whereas it overestimates excess adsorption at relatively
high pressures. This is mainly because of experimental errors and
the basic hypotheses of the SLD model. Taking manometry as an example,
nonadsorbing helium is widely applied for measuring the dead volume
by expansion. It is well known that helium can diffuse and/or adsorb
in micropores (ø < 2 nm), which are not available
for methane adsorption because of its large kinetic diameter under
high pressure.78 This effect may lead to
an apparent dead volume that is larger than the actual value, and
this is considered to be a major source of uncertainty in manometry.
Additionally, because of the cumulative effect of errors on the volumes
in manometry, the highest average relative error for a complete isotherm
can reach 10.0% or more.79

As a direct
method, the gravimetric method appears to be reliable,
and it may show a relatively high deviation at high pressures. Otherwise,
the buoyancy effect of the adsorbed phase is always neglected, which
may underestimate the adsorbed quantities for the gravimetric methods.80 The SLD model supposes that the adsorbed phase
and bulk phase obey the same EOS and calculates the density of the
adsorbed phase. It should be noted that even the adsorbed gas appears
in a compressed state, which cannot be accurately described by the
EOS. The ESD EOS can predict the gas volume better than the Peng–Robinson
EOS, but the ESD model is weaker for predicting the adsorption phase
with liquidlike densities.81

Another
possibility is that the specific surface area derived by
the BET theory is not capable of characterizing the specific surface
area in reality, especially for shale samples containing micropores.82,83 The BET theory was derived from the Langmuir model with an additional
hypothesis. For shale samples containing wide pores, pore filling
may occur at pressures close to the pressure range where a monolayer–multilayer
forms on the pore walls, which will lead to a considerable overestimation
of the monolayer capacity.84 Furthermore,
to simplify the computational process, the assumed geometry in the
SLD model is a rectangular prism. However, as widely observed by FE-SEM
and FIB-SEM, the pores in shales are mostly cylindrical in reality.
This discrepancy in the geometry between the actual shale and the
SLD model may engender a deviation between the experimental and calculated
data.

Conclusions and Summary
High-pressure methane adsorption
isotherms were determined at different
temperatures for shale samples collected from the Longmaxi Formations
in the Sichuan Basin, southwest China. The SLD/ESD model was used
to accurately describe supercritical methane adsorption on the tested
shales and published gas adsorption data from the literature. The
conclusions from this study are as follows.

The three samples
investigated here display a TOC content range
of 1.54–6.13%. The samples are dominated by siliceous minerals
(46.5–62.8%), clay minerals (11–41.8%), and carbonatite
(6.5–38.7%). Their BET specific surface areas range from 14.07
to 23.61 m2/g. The equivalent vitrinite reflectance varies
from 1.3 to 2.3% and reaches the level for gas generation.

The
methane adsorption capacity is primarily positively correlated
with the TOC content, which indicates that the TOC content is a major
factor controlling the adsorption capacity. The correlation between
excess methane adsorption and BET specific surface area is not significant.
As the temperature increases, the excess adsorption decreases, and
the rate of decrease shows a good linear correlation with the TOC
content, which demonstrates that the TOC content is sensitive to temperature.

The SLD/ESD model with only two temperature-independent regression
parameters shows good consistency for the representation of adsorption
isotherms within an AAD % of <5. This model is also capable of
describing excess adsorption data from the literature.
