Protein
fibrils are regarded as undesired products as these are
associated with numerous neuro- and non-neurodegenerative disorders.
Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism of fibrillation involves
the formation of various oligomeric intermediates, which are known
to be more toxic than mature fibrils. Here, we report the impact of
synthesized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) of diameters ∼52 nm
on the aggregation behavior of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) under
heat and acidic conditions. Congo red as well as ThT binding assays
and AFM imaging studies indicate that SiNPs trigger the amyloid formation
of HEWL in a dose-dependent manner. ThT kinetic studies and FTIR studies
suggest that the fibrillation kinetics does not involve the formation
of toxic oligomeric intermediates at higher concentrations of SiNPs.
By measuring fluorescence lifetime values of the bound ThT, SiNP-induced
fibrillation of HEWL can easily be realized. CD spectroscopic studies
indicate that native HEWL becomes unfolded upon incubation under the
experimental conditions and is rapidly converted into the β-sheet-rich
fibrillar aggregates in the presence of SiNPs with increasing concentrations.
It has been further revealed that fibrillar aggregates formed at higher
concentrations of SiNPs preferably adopt an antiparallel β-sheet
configuration. The enhanced fibrillation in the presence of SiNPs
is likely because of preferential adsorption of the non-amyloidogenic
regions of HEWL, resulting in the exposure of the aggregation-prone
regions of HEWL toward the solvent. The study will provide deeper
insights into the evolution of oligomer-free fibrillation that can
be useful to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of amyloid fibrillation.

1 Introduction
Amyloid
fibrils are a special type of misfolded protein/peptide
aggregates that form under stressful conditions both in vitro and in vivo.1−3In vivo amyloid
fibril formation is always considered as an undesired manifestation
as it is linked with more than 20 different neuro- and non-neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, and type II diabetes.4−8 Each amyloidosis process is associated with the aggregation of a
particular amyloid-forming protein.9 Although
all amyloid forming proteins are different from each other in terms
of amino acid sequences and tertiary folds in their native state,
they share a common structural morphology in the polymerized state,
that is, after fibrillation, thus making amyloid fibrillation a generic
property of all proteins.6,8 Fibrils are inherently
stable, nonbranched protein aggregates of predominantly β-sheet
structures with solvent-exposed grooves.3 The grooves run parallel with the β-strands, each of which
is connected by loops and stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonds.10 Because of this structural aspect, fibrillar
aggregates are typically stained by the dyes Congo red and thioflavin
T that bind within the grooves.11,12 The formation of β-sheet-rich
amyloid fibrils involves significant restructuring of the natively
folded or intrinsically disordered protein.13 Increasing evidence has proven that the restructuring process proceeds
either by a one-step or two-step assembly mechanism. In the one-step
assembly mechanism, the energetically unfavorable oligomers generated
during the course of fibrillation have a lifetime too short to be
detected in the solution, and the long, straight fibrils are formed
through an oligomer-free pathway. The two-step fibrillation mechanism
proceeds via oligomerization at the nucleation phase followed by the
conversion of the oligomers into long, cross-linked mature fibrils
via the initial formation of curvilinear, small protofibrils. The
oligomers produced during the fibrillation process are sufficiently
stable and often detected along with the mature fibrils in the saturation
phase.14−16 Even though the second pathway is well accepted and
follows the most common fibrillation kinetics involving a lag phase,
growth phase, and plateau or saturation phase, the one-step oligomer-free
pathways are sometimes found to occur at elevated temperatures.17 It is still a matter of debate whether the restructuring
of the native or intrinsically disordered state into a highly ordered
fibrillar state occurs via oligomerization or an oligomer-free pathway.
The cytotoxicity associated with the fibrils has been shown to be
exerted to a greater extent from the oligomer intermediates rather
than the matured fibrils.18 It is therefore
of particular interest to know if fibrillar aggregates are accompanied
by the oligomer intermediates or not. It is important to establish
and/or develop newer strategies/devices for the inhibition of protein
oligomerization as the pathogenesis of amyloidosis is directly linked
to the formation of toxic oligomeric intermediates during the fibrillation
process.

Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), although not directly
linked to
any disease conditions, is widely studied as a model protein to explore
many aspects related to protein structure, folding, and aggregation
over the years. The use of HEWL in understanding the aggregation or
fibrillation of proteins is relevant because it shares almost 70%
structural resemblance with human lysozyme whose two specific mutants
(I56T and D67H) are known to cause a kind of non-neuropathic amyloidosis
through fibrillation.19 HEWL contains four
disulfide linkages because of which it has high thermal stability
and shows reluctance to become unfolded at elevated temperature and
physiological pH. Unfolding of HEWL that can initiate the fibrillation
process therefore requires some drastic denaturing conditions, such
as the combination of high temperature and low pH or high temperature
along with different denaturants if physiological pH is maintained.20−22 Most reports on the fibrillation of HEWL have used elevated temperature
and acidic pH conditions for fibrillation because hydrolysis of HEWL
resulting in the fragmentation into amyloidogenic peptide segments
is facilitated under these conditions.23−25 It has already been
documented that a few peptide fragments of HEWL such as 49–101
and 53–101 are more amyloidogenic than the full-length protein.26 In the present article, we have used the conditions
of high temperature (65 °C) and low pH (pH 2) to monitor HEWL
fibrillation in the presence of silica nanoparticles. Before discussion
on the main objectives of this study, we would like to focus on the
influence of nanomaterials on protein fibrillation. Recently, nanoscale
materials have received significant attention because of their very
small size, large surface area, and especially remarkable optical,
electronic, and catalytic properties.27 Nanomaterials are also found to affect protein fibrillation in a
positive sense, that is, the fibrillation process is enhanced in the
presence of nanoparticles in most cases, although inhibition reports
are also available.28−31 Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are one of such biologically relevant
nanomaterials that have found use owing to its low toxicity, excellent
biocompatibility, and high thermal stability.32 Moreover, the particle sizes of the SiNPs can be precisely manipulated
for various applications. Facile preparation, large surface area,
and high charge density make SiNPs ideal for specific protein adsorption
and separation studies.33 The surface charge
of functionalized SiNPs has profound implications in inducing or retarding
protein fibrillation. For example, positively charged surface-modified
mesoporous SiNPs are found to reduce the fibrillation process of α-synuclein,
whereas the negatively charged SiNPs had the reverse effect.34 The presence of nanoparticles can thus either
accelerate or inhibit the fibrillation process, and this depends on
whether it is able to shorten the lag phase by favoring the nucleation
or blocking the growing ends of the oligomer, thereby inhibiting the
fibrillation process. This could mean that a nanoparticle-based approach
could be considered to modulate the fibrillation process of proteins
that can be useful to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of fibrillation.
In the present study, we have synthesized silica nanoparticles (SiNPs)
with a diameter of 52.5 ± 0.13 nm, and studied its influence
on the secondary structure of HEWL under conditions of pH 2 and at
a constant temperature of 65 °C for several days. These conditions
were chosen because the amyloid fibrillation of HEWL takes place at
elevated temperature and low pH in vitro conditions.35−38 Various biophysical techniques have been employed to analyze the
effects of SiNPs with HEWL during the fibrillation process, and we
have seen that SiNPs promote the progress of fibril formation from
a disordered structure of HEWL at acidic pH and elevated temperature
conditions. Using FTIR spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that long,
cross-linked fibrils of an antiparallel β-sheet configuration
are formed in an oligomer-free pathway in the presence of higher concentrations
of SiNPs.

2 Results and Discussion
During the formation
of amyloid fibrils, a number of oligomeric
species with varied morphology and stability have been identified.39−41 Although the function or the level of cytotoxicity associated with
these intermediates is not exactly known, they are believed to be
more cytotoxic than the mature fibrils.42 Typically, the in vitro fibrillation process follows
a sigmoidal kinetic profile in which three distinct phases, such as
nucleation or lag phase, growth phase, and plateau or saturation phase
can be identified.17,43 Mounting evidence suggests that
the conformationally altered oligomeric intermediates are predominantly
formed in the nucleation or lag phase.8,44,45 Thus, monitoring the lag phase in the protein fibrillation
process in the presence of an external additive is of great interest
because this can directly predict how and to what extent protein fibrillation
will proceed in the presence of that particular additive, in this
case, silica nanoparticles, at low pH and high temperature conditions.
The influence of silica nanoparticles on the lag phase of HEWL fibrillation
kinetics is therefore of prime interest. This has been addressed by
varying the concentration of silica nanoparticles and monitoring the
extent of formation of the oligomeric species during the fibrillation
process. Furthermore, we have also investigated the β-sheet
configuration of HEWL fibrils in the presence of SiNPs.

2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of SiNPs
SiNPs were
synthesized using a sol–gel method from TEOS,
a precursor of silica.69 A typical sol–gel
reaction is the hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS performed in ethanol
medium in the presence of ammonium hydroxide serving as a catalyst
of the reaction. The colloidal white nanoparticles precipitated were
characterized for their size, surface charge, functional groups, and
morphology using DLS, zeta potential, XRD, FTIR, TEM, and FESEM, respectively.
DLS studies indicate that the majority of nanoparticles have 52.5
± 0.13 nm diameter (Figure S1a). We
have also determined the surface charge of the nanoparticles at two
different pH values, under neutral (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 2) conditions.
At pH 7.4, the nanoparticles are found to have a high negative charge
on their surface (ζ = −13.5 ± 0.4 mV), whereas at
pH 2, they remain neutral or become slightly positively charged (ζ
= 0.49 ± 0.02 mV) in the solution, indicating that the nanoparticles
almost reach their isoelectric point at pH 2 (Figure S1b).46 The XRD pattern
shows an intense sharp peak centered at 2θ = 24°, which
indicates the high percentage of amorphous nanoparticles (Figure S1c). The FTIR spectrum of SiNPs shows
four sharp bands at 1090, 967, 800, and 464 cm–1 (Figure S1d). The absorption peaks at
1090, 967, and 800 cm–1 are assigned to the Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching vibrations, Si–OH asymmetric stretching
vibrations, and Si–O symmetric stretching vibrations, respectively.47 The Si–O rocking vibrations are observed
at 467 cm–1, and the absorption band in the range
of 3500–3600 cm–1 is assigned to the OH stretching
vibrations of hydroxyl groups in the nanoparticles.47 FESEM and TEM images of SiNPs as shown in Figure S1e,f revealed that the prepared nanoparticles were
mostly monodisperse and spherical in shape with an average diameter
of 50–60 nm, which is consistent with the DLS study.

2.2 Congo red binding studies
The extent
of aggregation of HEWL into amyloid fibrils under heat and acidic
pH conditions in the presence and absence of SiNPs has been evaluated
using a Congo red binding assay after 12 days of incubation. Congo
red is a histologic dye that can stain amyloid fibrils upon binding
to the well-ordered β-sheets of fibrillar aggregates.11 In this assay, the formation of the fibrils
in a solution are detected by a red shift in its absorption maxima
from ∼498 nm (in aqueous or native protein solutions) to ∼540
nm (in fibrillar solution).11,48 Congo red molecules
are thought to intercalate along the fibril axes in the grooves on
the β-sheet surface of fibrillar aggregates, and the binding
is facilitated by both hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic interactions.48,49 The red shift in the Congo red absorption maxima in the presence
of amyloid fibrils is attributed to the stability of Congo red molecules
within the fibrillar grooves.50 The Congo
red spectra for different HEWL fibrillar solutions in the presence
and absence SiNPs are represented in Figure 1. It is observed that the maximum absorbance
peak of Congo red at 498 nm in aqueous solution is red-shifted to
an extent of only 9–10 nm in the case of incubated HEWL without
SiNPs. This points toward the lack of formation of mature fibrils
in the solution of HEWL, although the formation of small oligomeric
species from the native structure of HEWL during the incubation period
cannot be ruled out. In the presence of increasing concentrations
of SiNPs, the red shift gradually becomes more prominent, and the
extent of red shifts is ∼20, ∼29, and ∼40 nm
in the presence of 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL SiNPs, respectively.
Moreover, the peak of Congo red absorption maxima is broadened in
the HEWL sample treated with SiNPs. This may be due to the contribution
of both the free Congo red as well as fibril-bound Congo red. This
clearly indicates that SiNPs induce the formation of mature fibrils
in a dose-dependent manner under heat and acidic pH conditions.

spectra for all kinds of HEWL samples in the
presence and absence of SiNPs after incubation at 65 °C and acidic
pH for 12 days.

2.3 Detection
of HEWL Fibrillar Aggregates in
the Presence of SiNPs using ThT Fluorescence and Lifetime Measurement
Studies and AFM Imaging
A detailed analysis of the impact
of SiNPs on the fibrillation process of HEWL has been carried out
using ThT-based fluorescence studies. ThT is extensively used as a
sensitive fluorescence active dye for probing the formation of fibrils.12 Although ThT is weakly fluorescent in water,
it shows a several fold increase in fluorescence emission intensity
when bound to highly ordered fibrillar aggregates where it inserts
itself in the solvent-exposed “grooves” formed by aromatic
side-chain amino acids containing crossed β-strands of amyloid
fibrils and becomes stabilized.35,51,52 The steady state-fluorescence spectra of ThT for all the HEWL samples
taken after 12 days of incubation are shown in Figure 2a. The ThT fluorescence intensity of the
HEWL solution incubated without SiNPs is higher compared with that
of ThT in water. This increase is however not to an extent (0.5 fold
increase in ThT fluorescence intensity as compared to ThT in water)
that can confirm the formation of mature HEWL fibrils.50,53 The lower extent of increase in the ThT fluorescence intensity for
the incubated HEWL sample without SiNPs can account for the formation
of non-fibrillar oligomeric protein aggregates or amorphous aggregates
with which ThT does not show strong binding affinity.55 A significant enhancement in ThT fluorescence intensity
observed for the HEWL solutions incubated with SiNPs is an indication
of the formation of fibrillar aggregates. For 50 and 100 μg/mL
SiNP-containing solutions, the increase in intensity is almost double
in comparison to that of the 20 μg/mL SiNP-containing solution.
This implies that the amount of fibril formation increases at higher
concentrations of SiNPs.

Figure 2 (a) ThT fluorescence profiles of HEWL–SiNP
samples after
incubation for 12 days. (b) ThT kinetic profiles for all incubated
HEWL samples during the course of fibrillation.

ThT fluorescence-based fibrillation kinetic studies for different
HEWL solutions have been monitored during the incubation period for
up to 12 days, and the representative profiles are shown in Figure 2b. The kinetic profiles
are analyzed using eq 1, and the resultant parameters such as lag time, rate constant of
aggregation, and t1/2 are summarized in Table 1. Figure 2b indicates that in the presence
of SiNPs, HEWL fibrillation proceeds through a nucleation-dependent
polymerization process in which an initial lag phase is involved.
From Table 1, it is
evident that SiNPs shorten the lag phase of the fibrillation process
in a dose-dependent fashion and at the same time increase the rate
of the fibrillation process with respect to the control solution (where
HEWL is incubated without nanoparticles). For example, the lag time
of fibrillation for 20 μg/mL SiNPs is found to be 113.1 ±
2.0 h, whereas those for 50 and 100 μg/mL SiNPs are 78.1 ±
2.1 h and 62.3 ± 2.3 h, respectively. Because the oligomeric
species appear in the lag phase, it can thus be inferred that oligomers
are formed at all concentrations of SiNPs as in all cases, a lag phase
of a certain period is involved. However, the stability of these oligomeric
species varies depending upon the duration of the lag phase as well
as the rate constant for the aggregation process for each sample.
The lowest lag time and highest rate constant value (34.8 ± 0.7
h–1) in the case of 100 μg/mL SiNPs results
in the disappearance of the oligomer species soon after formation
and promotes the aggregation into amyloid fibrils directly from the
monomeric proteins. On the other hand, at lower concentrations of
SiNPs (20 μg/mL), oligomers are likely to be stable for a finite
time period before participation in aggregation. An extended period
of lag time with a much lower rate constant value for the incubated
HEWL in the absence SiNPs indicates that oligomers produced at the
lag phase are sufficiently stable and hence, they have high chances
to be dissociated again into the monomer species.44,54

Table 1 Calculated Lag Time, t1/2, and Rate Constant of the HEWL Aggregation Process
in the Presence and Absence of SiNPs

(h)	t1/2 (h)	Rate constant

HEWL + 100 μg/mL SiNPs	62.3 ± 2.3	95.7 ± 1.4	34.8 ± 0.7	
To further ensure the increasing aggregation propensity of HEWL
in the presence of SiNPs, we have taken the AFM images of the samples
after 12 days of incubation under the experimental conditions employed,
and the images obtained are shown in Figure 3. In the absence of SiNPs, HEWL displays
discrete globular aggregates that are distinctly different from the
fiber-like species; meanwhile, the SiNP-treated samples show abundant
unbranched as well as elongated fibril formation. The images of SiNP-treated
samples also indicate that the extent of fibril formation as well
as the extent of cross-linking among the aggregates increases with
increasing nanoparticle concentrations. Moreover, the AFM images of
SiNP-treated HEWL samples show the presence of SiNPs on the fibrillar
structure. The microscopic results thus provide direct evidence for
the increased propensity of the formation of mature fibrils of HEWL
in the presence of SiNPs.

absence of SiNPs:
(a) incubated HEWL without SiNPs, (b) HEWL + 20 μg/mL SiNP,
(c) HEWL + 50 μg/mL SiNP , and (d) HEWL + 100 μg/mL SiNP.
The presence of SiNPs on the fibrillar structure is indicated by the
circles.

We further determined the average
lifetime of ThT in all HEWL solutions
incubated with and without SiNPs using time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC) spectroscopy. It is reported that ThT molecules can
rotate freely in water for which they show a short fluorescence lifetime
and low quantum yield, but upon binding to fibrillar aggregates, their
rotation becomes restricted and hence, they show high fluorescence
quantum yield along with a longer lifetime value.55Figure 4 shows the fluorescence decay of ThT in the presence of different
incubated HEWL solutions, and the average lifetime values obtained
from the satisfactory fitting of the decay curves are given in Table 2. The decay of bound
ThT in all HEWL solutions incubated with and without SiNPs is fitted
by a multiexponential function, whereas the unbound ThT in water and
ThT mixed with native HEWL are fitted by a double-exponential function.55 From Figure 4, it is observed that the decay patterns of ThT in
water and in the presence of native HEWL are almost similar indicating
that ThT does not bind to the native state. The fluorescence decay
of ThT in incubated HEWL solutions slows down and the associated average
lifetime is found to increase. However, in the HEWL samples incubated
with different concentrations of SiNPs, the decreasing effect in the
decay rates of ThT becomes more pronounced with the concomitant increase
of the average lifetime values. The longest average lifetime value
of 0.790±0.008 ns is observed for ThT in the incubated HEWL sample
with 100 μg/mL SiNPs. This lifetime value is almost double with
respect to the lifetime observed in incubated HEWL (0.410 ± 0.007
ns) without SiNPs. The data in Table 2 therefore supports the SiNP-induced fibrillation of
HEWL.

in the presence and absence of SiNPs after incubation at 65°C
and pH 2 for 12 days.

2.4 Assessment of Structural Changes of HEWL upon
Fibrillation in the Presence of SiNPs: Trp and ANS Fluorescence Studies
HEWL has intrinsic fluorescence because of the presence of six
Trp residues in its native structure; of these, Trp62 and Trp63 are
placed at the hydrophobic cleft.56 The
exposure of Trp residues affects the fluorescence quantum yield of
Trp in the native state. Monitoring the Trp fluorescence of HEWL thus
allows assessment of changes in the microenvironment of Trp after
incubation in the presence and absence of SiNPs. Incubation of HEWL
without SiNPs resulted in significant quenching of Trp fluorescence
intensity and a red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from
348 to 360 nm (Figure 5a), indicating that the Trp moieties in HEWL are more accessible
to the solvent that results in quenching. However, the Trp fluorescence
intensity is found to increase gradually with increasing concentrations
of SiNPs with no significant change of the red-shifted emission maxima.
Moreover, the observed Trp fluorescence intensity in the case of the
highest chosen concentration of SiNPs (100 μg/mL) is still lower
as compared to the native HEWL (Figure 5a). The results suggest that Trp residues are buried
in a hydrophobic environment in the presence of SiNPs, but the hydrophobic
environment around the Trp residues in this case is different from
that of native HEWL. The situation can be explained if we speculate
that the Trp residues gradually become buried within the fibrillar
network surrounded by the polar SiNPs and hence, a considerable extent
of red shift in the emission maxima is still found in the Trp fluorescence
profile of the solution with the highest concentration of SiNPs (100 μg/mL).
In the AFM images, it is clearly observed that the fibrils formed
in the presence of SiNPs are surrounded by nanoparticles.

Figure 5 (a) Trp and
(b) ANS fluorescence profiles of native HEWL and all
incubated HEWL–SiNPs samples.

Further information regarding the relative hydrophobic exposure
of HEWL on treatment with SiNPs can be obtained using the hydrophobic
fluorescent probe ANS. The intensity of ANS fluorescence emission
is markedly enhanced upon binding to the hydrophobic surfaces of the
protein, and consequently, the emission maxima show a blue shift.57 ANS fluorescence profiles for HEWL before and
after treatment with SiNPs are shown in Figure 5b. It is observed that the fluorescence intensity
of ANS in buffer medium and that in the presence of native HEWL are
similar, but the intensity increases with a 14 nm blue shift when
incubated in the absence of nanoparticles. This suggests that the
hydrophobicity around HEWL is increased upon incubation under the
conditions employed. Increase in the ANS fluorescence intensity together
with the shift of emission maxima further towards left (blue side)
as compared to incubated HEWL is suggestive of the formation of fibrillar
aggregates enriched with exposed hydrophobic residues in the presence
of SiNPs. This study is in agreement with the observations from the
Trp fluorescence studies.

2.5 Effect of SiNPs on the
Secondary Structure
of HEWL: Circular Dichroism (CD) Analyses
CD spectroscopy
has been performed to measure the alteration of the secondary structure
of HEWL after addition of SiNPs. Figure 6 shows the far-UV CD spectra of HEWL incubated
in the presence and absence of SiNPs at different concentrations.
Two negative minima, one at 208 nm and the other at 222 nm, are clearly
visible in the spectrum of native HEWL (black line). This indicates
the high percentage of helical conformation (47.6 ± 0.2% α-helix)
in the native state of HEWL.58 The helical
conformation of native HEWL is almost destroyed after incubation as
indicated by the disappearance of the negative minima at 208 nm. A
distinct negative band appears at 198 nm featuring the random coil
conformation of HEWL. CD spectroscopy reveals that HEWL remains in
the unfolded state even after incubation for 12 days under the conditions
of high temperature and acidic pH. However, the addition of SiNPs
triggers the aggregation process of HEWL under the same conditions
resulting in a gradual shift of the negative minima from 198 to ∼217
nm with increasing concentrations (Figure 6). In particular, 20 μg/mL SiNPs cannot
change the position of the negative band at 198 nm, but careful observation
shows another small minimum around 217 nm, suggesting the formation
of fibrillar aggregates from unfolded proteins. The percentage of
β-sheet-rich fibrillar aggregates in the solution increases
with increasing concentrations of nanoparticles, and the maximum aggregation
has been achieved at the highest chosen concentration of SiNPs (100
μg/mL), and in this case, the minima are completely shifted
from 198 nm to give rise to a new broad negative band near the 215–218
nm region, which is the characteristic β-sheet region. Tabulation
using the online server DICHROWEB provides a quantitative estimation
of the secondary structural content of HEWL before and after the treatment
of SiNPs and is summarized in Table 3. Table 3 clearly indicates that native HEWL that contains the highest α-helical
content shows maximum percentage of random coil conformation after
incubation for 12 days in the absence of nanoparticles and renders
the maximum extent of β-sheet formation in the presence of 100
μg/mL SiNPs

2.6 Evaluation of the Structural Features of SiNP-Induced
Fibrillar Aggregates Using FTIR Spectroscopy
Understanding
the structural features of SiNP-treated fibrillar aggregates of HEWL
can be obtained by FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy has an advantage
over CD spectroscopy as it can discriminate parallel and antiparallel
β-sheet configurations in the fibrillar aggregates of proteins.
Fibrillar aggregates of antiparallel β-sheet structures show
two positive peaks, one in the high-frequency region (above 1680 cm–1) and the other in the low-frequency region (below
1640 cm–1), and the absence of the high-frequency
peak in the FTIR difference spectrum is a typical feature for the
parallel β-sheet structure of fibrillar aggregates.59−61Figure 7a displays
the FTIR spectra for the protein samples. Here, we focus only on the
amide I region (1700–1600 cm–1) of HEWL to
account for the alteration of the secondary structural components.
There is no noticeable change except the shift of the higher-frequency
band of native HEWL after incubation with SiNPs. This implies that
alterations occur in the secondary structure of native HEWL during
incubation. To obtain more detailed information about the secondary
structural change, we have shown the FTIR difference spectra in Figure 7b where each spectrum
is obtained after subtraction of the spectrum of native HEWL. In the
difference spectra, the untreated HEWL does not show any high- or
low-frequency peak. However, a peak in the higher-frequency region
develops in the SiNP-treated samples, indicating the formation of
fibrillar aggregates of an antiparallel β-sheet configuration.
The peak gains prominence for higher concentrations of SiNPs, and
in the case of 100 μg/mL concentration of SiNPs, this peak lies
at 1686 cm–1, which corresponds to the actual characteristic
region for the antiparallel β-sheet structure aggregates.61 In addition, a peak developing in the lower-frequency
region, that is, below 1630 cm–1, is also observed
at 100 μg/mL SiNPs. This indicates the formation of a large
and extended β-sheet-rich fibrillar structure with a predominantly
antiparallel configuration at the higher concentration of SiNPs.

and (b) FTIR difference spectral profiles for native HEWL
and incubated HEWL samples in the presence and absence of 20, 50,
and 100 μg/mL SiNPs.

The difference spectra also points toward the kinetics of
the fibrillation
in the presence of the SiNPs. It is reported that the fibrillation
occurs following a one-step or two-step mechanism.62,63 The two-step mechanism is accompanied by the formation of toxic
oligomers, whereas in the one-step mechanism, the oligomers formed
in the nucleation phase are too unstable to exist in the solution
for at least a measurable time period and dissociate instantaneously
into the fibril precursor species, making the process free from oligomeric
intermediates. Usually, the oligomer-free pathway is observed at elevated
temperatures.61,64 The assembly process involving
oligomer formation or without oligomer formation can be detected using
FTIR spectroscopy. A low-frequency peak that develops below 1620 cm–1 is indicative of oligomer assembly, whereas oligomer-free
assembly induces a peak above 1620 cm–1. From Figure 7b, it is evident
that fibrillar aggregates formed in the 100 μg/mL SiNP-treated
sample yield a distinct peak at 1623 cm–1, implying
that fibrillation proceeds through an oligomer-free pathway, especially
at higher concentrations of SiNPs. The considerably lower lag time
in the 100 μg/mL SiNP-treated sample (obtained from ThT-based
kinetic studies) also supports this oligomer-free fibrillation kinetics.
Because fibrillar toxicity is initiated from the oligomeric intermediates,
we can say that the fibrillar aggregates developed at higher concentration
of SiNPs should be apparently less toxic.42 In a recent report, it has been said that HEWL forms oligomer-free
β-sheets of a parallel configuration at a high temperature (62
°C) and acidic conditions (pH 2). The present study also indicates
that the kinetics of SiNP-induced HEWL fibrillation follows an oligomer-free
pathway under similar conditions, but the fibrillar aggregates formed
in these cases are antiparallel in nature.

2.7 Measurement
of Sizes of Fibrillar Aggregates
Using Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Studies
The oligomer-free
fibrillation process in the presence of SINPs can also be probed using
DLS measurements. The DLS measurements were conducted with the incubated
samples to differentiate the sizes of the fibrillar aggregates in
the presence of SiNPs. Figure 8 shows the histograms of the intensity of the scattered light
for all samples, and the obtained average sizes are given in Table 4. HEWL in its native
state has an average size of only 4.2 ± 0.1 nm, which upon incubation
increases to 58.6 ± 0.7 nm. The increase in size after incubation
can be accounted for by the formation of smaller globular aggregates
from unfolded HEWL as observed in the AFM image (Figure 3). A significant size difference
has been observed when HEWL is incubated with SiNPs, indicating the
formation of larger fibrous aggregates. The average particle sizes
of SiNP-treated HEWL samples are found to increase with concentration,
that is, to 531.0 ± 3.0, 955.6 ± 3.0, and 1106.0 ±
7.0 nm in the presence of 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL SiNPs, respectively.
This is consistent with the AFM images where the extent of cross-linking
between the fibrillar aggregates was found to increase with increasing
concentrations of SiNPs. Moreover, the broad size distribution pattern
in the SiNP-treated samples reveals the heterogeneity of the fibrillar
aggregates. The broad distribution in sizes may also appear because
of the presence of aggregated nanoparticles as SiNPs are reported
to be aggregated upon interaction with HEWL.33,65 HEWL samples treated with 50 and 100 μg/mL SiNPs do not show
any size distribution pattern at the lower ranges (<100 nm). This
clearly ruled out the possibility of the formation of oligomeric intermediates
during the fibrillation process, which is in agreement with the FTIR
results.

and absence of 20, 50, and 100 μg/mL SiNPs.

2.8 Physical Explanation for the SiNP-Induced
Fibrillation of HEWL
The zeta potential measurements of SiNPs
suggest that nanoparticles are almost neutral at pH 2 as stated earlier,
whereas HEWL (pI = 10.7) bears a high positive charge (∼15–17
positive charges) at this pH.66 This implies
that electrostatic interactions between HEWL molecules and SiNPs are
expected to be weak. The high charge density on HEWL may lead to its
adsorption on the surface of the SiNPs to get rid of the strong self-repulsion
existing between HEWL molecules. The adsorption behavior of HEWL on
SiNPs has been checked, and it was observed that the HEWL adsorption
capacity of 1 mg/mL SiNPs is 0.05 mg at pH 2 (Figure S2 of Supporting Information). The adsorption most
likely occurred because of the hydrogen bonding interactions between
the silanol groups of SiNPs and the −COOH moieties present
in the side-chain acidic amino acid residues (pKa ≤ 3) or the regions containing the acidic amino acid
residues of HEWL at pH 2. As the polypeptide chain is in an unfolded
form under the conditions, the other regions are expected to be exposed
to the solvent. If the solvent-exposed parts are really the “hot
spots” of aggregation, the fibrillation process is likely to
proceed at a faster rate. The hot spot areas of HEWL have been identified
by the help of an online server “AGGRESCAN”,67 and the predicted hot spot areas against the
amino acids sequence of HEWL are shown in Figure 9. Interestingly, the amino acid residues
present in the hot spot regions show that almost all acidic amino
acid residues are located outside the hot spot zones of HEWL (identified
by a green color). Thus, we can say that the SiNPs are likely to adsorb
the non-amylogenic regions of HEWL preferentially where most of the
acidic amino acids are located, resulting in the exposure of the aggregation-prone
or hot spot regions of HEWL toward the solvent. As a result, the fibrillation/aggregation
process is triggered. Furthermore, earlier literature suggests that
under heat and acidic conditions, HEWL is hydrolyzed into smaller
fragments and the fragmentation occurs via the peptide bond cleavage
of the Asp amino acid residues of HEWL.23,68 Among the
fragmented peptides, the 49–101, 53–101, and 57–107
residue fragments are identified as the most amyloid-prone fragments,
whereas the 1–38 and 108–129 residue fragments correspond
to the non-amyloidogenic regions of HEWL.23 Therefore, the adsorption of acidic amino acid residues, especially
Asp residues by SiNPs, facilitates the cleavage of Asp-containing
peptide bonds that results in the formation of amyloidogenic fragments
at a greater rate.

Figure 9 “Hot spot” regions of HEWL obtained from
AGGRESCAN
are shown by the red color histogram plotted against the amino acid
sequences of HEWL (all acidic amino acid residues are identified by
a green color).

3 Conclusions
In the present study, we have demonstrated that SiNPs trigger the
amyloid formation of HEWL in a concentration-dependent manner under
heat and acidic conditions. Our results indicate that the fibrillation
kinetics does not involve the formation of toxic oligomeric intermediates
at the higher concentrations of SiNPs. We further reveal that the
fibrillar aggregates formed at the higher concentrations of SiNPs
preferably adopt an antiparallel β-sheet configuration. We believe
that the present study will provide a deeper insight into the understanding
of the evolution of nontoxic amyloid fibrils that could be useful
to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of amyloid fibrillation.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
HEWL,
Thioflavin T (ThT),
Congo red, and 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, U.S.A.). Tetraethoxysilane (purity, 98%)
was purchased from Alfa Aesar, India. Other chemicals used for this
study were obtained from SRL, India, and used as received. Spectroscopic
measurements were performed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu, Model 1800) and a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorimeter.

4.2 Preparation of Silica Nanoparticles
Colloidal
solutions of SiNPs of diameters 50–60 nm were prepared
in a nonaqueous system of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) using a sol–gel
method as described by Stöber et al.69 In brief, the required amount of ammonium hydroxide was mixed with
half of the required volume of anhydrous ethanol. The alkaline solution
was then added dropwise to a requisite volume of TEOS solution in
ethanol with continuous stirring at room temperature (25 °C).
The molar ratios of ethanol/NH3/H2O/TEOS are
maintained at 15.40:0.11:2.40:1.00. The resulting reaction mixture
was kept at room temperature for 3 days to allow the hydrolysis of
TEOS as much as possible. Finally, the nanoparticles were separated
from the reaction mixture using centrifugation followed by washing
three to four times and stored at 4 °C for further use.

4.3 Preparation of HEWL Fibrillar Solutions
A stock solution
of HEWL was prepared by weighing 50 mg of dry
HEWL powder and dissolving in 1 mL double-distilled water and stored
at 0 °C. The concentration of the stock solution was measured
spectrophotometrically using HEWL (ε280 = 37 646
M–1cm–1).70 HEWL solutions in the presence and absence of various concentrations
(20, 50, and 100 μg/mL) of SiNPs were prepared in 50 mM HCl–KCl
buffer (pH 2) and incubated at 65 °C and pH 2 for 12 days. The
pH of the protein solutions was checked before and after incubation
and found to be stable. The final concentration of HEWL taken for
incubation was 150 μM. All incubated solutions were left overnight
at room temperature at the end of incubation for further use. The
desired concentration for each experimental measurement was achieved
by dilution with 20 mM phosphate buffer of pH 7.4.

4.4 Congo Red Binding Assay
The incubated
HEWL solutions (10 μM) in the presence and absence of different
concentrations of SiNPs were added to 7 μM Congo red in 20 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and the mixtures were kept at room temperature
for 30 min in the dark before recording UV–vis absorption spectra.
The spectra were recorded in the wavelength region 200–600
nm. The control experiments were also carried out in the absence of
SiNPs.

4.5 Thioflavin T (ThT) Assay
For the
ThT fluorescence assays, the samples (5 μM) were mixed with
ThT solution (10 μM) and incubated at room temperature in the
dark for 5 min to allow binding. The spectra were recorded in 20 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) from 460 to 600 nm on excitation at 440
nm. The slit width and the integration time were set at 5 nm and 0.3
s, respectively.

Fibrillar growth was monitored by withdrawing
aliquots at different time intervals up to 12 days, mixed with the
solution of ThT, and the spectra were recorded using the same parameter.
The kinetic profiles for all samples were then fitted by a sigmoidal
curve and the lag phase, and the rate constant of the protein aggregation
was determined from the following empirical eq 1(71) 1  where, Y is
the ThT fluorescence intensity and x is the incubation
time. x0 indicates the half maximal ThT
fluorescence time (t1/2). The lag time
and the rate of aggregation are defined by x0 – 2τ and 1/τ, respectively. All other
parameters present in the equation are determined by fitting.

4.6 Time-Resolved Fluorescence Measurement
For time-resolved
measurements, a DeltaFlex modular fluorescence
lifetime system from HORIBA Scientific was used. The samples were
excited at 440 nm using a picosecond laser diode, and the signals
were collected at the magic angle (55°) using a high-voltage
microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (PPD-850) of HORIBA. The instrument
response function of the setup was ∼183 ps. The analyses of
the data were done using EZ Time and decay analysis software.

4.7 Trp and ANS Fluorescence Spectroscopic Studies
Trp
and ANS fluorescence emission spectra for all fibrillar samples
in the presence and absence of SiNPs were recorded at 315–450
and 400–600 nm wavelength ranges, respectively. For Trp fluorescence,
samples were excited at 295 nm, whereas for ANS fluorescence spectroscopy,
the excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm. The slit width as well
as the integration time for both studies was kept at 5 nm and 0.3
s, respectively. Sample concentrations were kept at 10 μM in
both cases. Before recording the ANS fluorescence spectroscopy, 2
μM ANS was mixed with the protein solutions and incubated at
room temperature for 1 h in the dark. For each experiment, the spectra
were corrected by blank subtraction.

4.8 Far-UV
CD Measurements
Far-UV CD
spectra of different fibrillar samples (10 μM) were taken in
a quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm path length on a JASCO-815 spectropolarimeter
at 25 °C in the wavelength range from 190–240 nm at a
scan rate of 50 nm/min. The spectra were corrected by the respective
controls. The secondary structural content was determined from these
spectra using DICHROWEB software.72

4.9 Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Studies
AFM images were
obtained with 10 μL of fibrillar samples (10
μM) in the presence and absence of different concentrations
of SiNPs applied on the freshly cleaved mica foils. They were then
air-dried and scanned under an atomic force microscope (model no.
5500, Agilent Technologies). Samples were imaged in a silicon probe
cantilever of length 100 μm with a resonance frequency of 146–236
kHz and a force constant of 21–98 Nm–1. The
detailed instrumentation procedure and sample preparation techniques
for FESEM and TEM are given in the Supporting Information.

4.10 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR)
Studies
FTIR spectra of SiNPs (1 mg of solid SiNPs) and different
SiNP-treated fibrillar samples (2 μL) were obtained from an
IRTracer-100 FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu) at room temperature in the
spectral range 4000–400 cm–1. Diamond ATR
was used for the acquisition of the spectra, and the number of acquisitions
given for each measurement was 64. The spectral resolution of the
FTIR instrument was kept at 8 cm–1. A spectrum of
air without samples was collected before scanning the samples. This
background was used to correct the spectra collected for the samples.

4.11 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Zeta Potential
Measurements
DLS measurements of SiNP solution (3 μg/mL)
as well as different fibrillar samples (5 μM) were carried out
on a Malvern Nano ZS instrument fitted with a 4 mW He–Ne laser
beam (λ = 632.8 nm, scattering angle of 173°) and a thermostatic
sample chamber at 25 °C. For zeta potential measurements of the
samples (7 μM), a Malvern Nano ZS instrument equipped with the
same accessories as mentioned for DLS studies was used.
