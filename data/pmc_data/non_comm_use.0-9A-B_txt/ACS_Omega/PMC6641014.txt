Control over the orientation of metal
nanorods is important for
both fundamental and applied research. We show that gold nanorods
(GNRs) can be aligned in a single direction by adsorbing positively
charged GNRs onto a double-strand DNA-grafted substrate through electrostatic
interaction. The ordered structure can be optimized by controlling
the density of the positive charges on the surface of the GNRs. We
found, in agreement with the results of theoretical simulation, that
the resultant structure exhibits plasmonic properties that are dependent
on the GNR orientation relative to the direction of an oscillating
electric field. Our approach provides new insights into the polymer-assisted
self-assembly of rod-shaped nanoparticles utilizing electrostatic
interactions.

Introduction
Metal nanoparticles
have an array of attractive electronic, optical,
and thermal properties, which have a variety of applications in sensing,1−3 drug delivery,4,5 and catalysis.6,7 To
harness these unique properties, their self-assembly into ordered
structures is of strategic importance.8−12 Recently, self-assemblies of rod-shaped nanoparticles
have been shown to display unique shape-dependent properties and functionalities.13,14 Examples of self-assembly techniques include drop-casting15,16 and external field-directed assembly.17−20 Ordered structures of rod-shaped
nanoparticles prepared by these previous techniques, however, are
dotted and of microscale dimensions, as the nanoparticle assemblies
are created through the drying process. The self-assembly of rod-shaped
nanoparticles over a large area, with controlled density, via the
drying process remains challenging due to thermal fluctuations and
diffusion; nevertheless, the ability to control the orientation of
anisotropic nanorods, in particular, is essential for the assembly
of extensive ordered structures. Interfacial assembly21,22 would enable orientation control of rod-shaped nanoparticles with
controlled density, but the resultant structure needs to be transferred
to a substrate for its application to devices. Recently, lithographically
patterned templates allow selective and precise placement of nanoparticles,
providing ordered arrays. However, these lithographic nanotemplate-assisted
techniques23,24 are unsuitable for extensive
ordering of rod-shaped nanoparticles due to cost and time constraints.

Specifically designed molecules within self-assembled monolayers,
liquid crystal molecules, and lipid bilayers can be more easily organized,
with controlled orientation. In macromolecular chemistry, charged
polymer chains condensed in a confined area tend to orient perpendicularly
to the grafted plane, as interactions between adjacent molecules,
including osmotic pressure and excluded volume effects, force them
to stretch.25−27 These surface-confined polymer chains are called
“charged polymer brushes”. Inspired by this “brush”-like
configuration, we speculated that a negatively charged polymer brush
could be used to control the orientation of positively charged rod-shaped
nanoparticles through simple electrostatics. Although there are some
reports on nanoparticle attachment on polymer brushes, no one has
reported the vertical alignment of rod-shaped nanoparticles.28,29 Thus, we aimed to align positively charged gold nanorods (GNRs)
vertically using polymer brush-assisted self-assembly, with the assistance
of a polymer brush composed of double-strand DNA (dsDNA), which is
a stiff anionic polymer with a persistent length of ca. 50 nm (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Vertical Assembly
of GNRs with the Assistance of a dsDNA Brush
Results and Discussion
First, we prepared DNA brushes.
We synthesized 148 bp dsDNA with
biotin and fluorophore (Alexa 647) modifications at the 5′
ends of the complementary strands using a standard polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) method. The biotinylated end was designed to allow
facile immobilization on a streptavidin surface, and the Alexa 647
dye provided a spectroscopic tag to allow monitoring of brush formation.
The length of the DNA is consistent with its persistent length, and
it is expected to behave as a stiff brush, which is important for
our purpose. We attached the DNA to a streptavidin-functionalized
substrate via the commonly exploited streptavidin–biotin interaction.
We prepared the DNA brush on the inside surface of a glass cuvette,
with an optical path length of 1 mm. The density of the DNA brush
surface coverage was derived from the fluorescence intensity of the
Alexa 647 fluorophore by comparison to known amounts of Alexa 647-labeled
DNA in a non-streptavidin-modified cuvette. The density of the DNA
brush was evaluated as 1200 chains/μm2, corresponding
to an average interchain distance of 31 nm. This value is reasonable
when compared to that in the results from the previous report.25 The average interchain distance of the DNA brush
was calculated on the basis of the assumption that fully stretched
DNA chains are arranged in a hexagonal pattern.

Second, we prepared
GNRs (34 nm × 10 nm) modified with a cationic
alkanethiol ligand (NH2EG6C11, see Scheme 1) on the basis of a previously reported procedure
(see Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1).30 The GNRs exhibited two plasmonic
modes. One is transverse localized surface plasmon resonance (TLSPR),
around 510 nm, excited by the oscillation of electrons along the major
axis of the GNRs. The other is longitudinal localized plasmon resonance
(LLSPR), around 760 nm, excited by the oscillation of electrons along
the minor axis of the GNRs. Optical properties of the GNRs were determined
by their orientation relative to the direction of the oscillating
electric field. Therefore, we could evaluate the orientation of the
GNRs adsorbed onto the DNA brush by measuring the extinction spectrum.31 In the extinction spectrum analysis, unless
otherwise stated, the direction of the incident light was perpendicular
to the plane containing the adsorbed GNRs. Therefore, when the GNRs
align vertically, only the TLSPR should be excited. In contrast, when
the GNR orientation is random, both TLSPR and LLSPR excitation should
be observed.

The GNRs modified with the cationic ligand were
adsorbed onto the
DNA brush, and the extinction spectrum was recorded using nonpolarized
light in a buffer solution (Figure S2).
As a result, the extinction spectrum showed a strong peak for LLSPR
at 920 nm, indicating that the GNR orientation was random. However,
we discovered that the intensity of the peak for LLSPR decreased under
a high salt concentration (2 M NaCl) (Figure S2). Considering that electrostatic interaction is weakened in the
presence of salt, this result suggests that the intensity of the electrostatic
attraction between the DNA brushes and the GNRs influences the orientation
of the adsorbed GNRs.

We further investigated the effect of
electrostatic attraction
intensity on nanorod orientation by tuning the density of the cationic
ligand on the surface of the GNRs. The GNRs were modified with a cationic
ligand and nonionic ligand (EG6C11, see Scheme 1) in various ratios. We confirmed that the
ζ potential of the GNRs increased in proportion to the ratio
of the cationic ligand (Figure S3). Hereafter,
we denote GNRs modified with cationic and nonionic ligands in a ratio
of x:y as GNR (x:y). The mixed ligand GNRs were adsorbed onto the
DNA brush, and the extinction spectra were again recorded with nonpolarized
light. We found that as the proportion of the cationic ligand decreased,
the intensity of the peak for LLSPR also decreased (Figure 1). This result suggests that
GNRs align mostly in a vertical direction when the electrostatic attraction
is weak. However, it is still possible that the decrease in LLSPR
intensity was caused by the plasmonic coupling of GNRs.

Figure 1 Extinction
spectra of GNRs adsorbed on a DNA brush in 10 mM Tris–HCl
buffer (pH = 7.7). The various mixing ratios were used as shown. The
adsorption time was 60 min in all cases.

Therefore, further investigation of GNR orientation was performed
using polarized light (both p- and s-polarized light) at various tilt
angles (Figure 2A).
First, we simulated the extinction spectra of perfectly vertically
aligned GNRs at various angles from the plane (θ). According
to the results of this simulation, p-polarized light excited both
LLSPR and TLSPR when the plane containing the adsorbed GNRs was rotated
(Figure 2B). s-Polarized
light, however, did not excite LLSPR, even when the plane was rotated
(Figure 2C). This tendency
was also observed in our experimental data (Figure 2D). In our experimental results, p-polarized
light excited LLSPR when the plane was rotated, with the peak LLSPR
excitation observed at 620 nm (Figure 2E). In contrast, LLSPR was not excited under s-polarized
light even when the plane was rotated in the same manner (Figure 2F), indicating that
the adsorbed GNRs were aligned vertically to the glass surface. The
ratio of LLSPR to TLSPR in the simulation results was higher than
that in our experimental results, suggesting that there is some fluctuation
in GNRs.

Figure 2 (A) Scheme showing the extinction of GNRs under p- and s-polarized
light. Simulated extinction spectra of perfectly aligned GNR under
p-polarized (B) and s-polarized (C) light. The center-to-center distance
of the GNRs was 30 nm. The peak for the excited LLSPR in (B) is located
around 650 nm. (D) Photos of the cuvette containing the adsorbed GNRs
through a polarizer. Extinction spectra of GNRs (1:4) adsorbed on
a DNA brush (1200 chains/μm2) under p-polarized (E)
and s-polarized (F) light. The adsorption time was 60 min. The amount
of adsorbed GNRs was 2500 particles/μm2. The average
center-to-center distance of the adsorbed GNRs was approximately 21
nm. The peak for the excited LLSPR in (E) is located around 620 nm.

We next confirmed the effect of
plasmonic coupling among nearest
neighboring GNRs. According to the simulation results for interparticle
distance dependence, as the center-to-center distance of the aligned
GNRs narrowed, the LLSPR excitation gradually blue-shifted due to
plasmonic coupling induced by the side-by-side assembly of GNRs (Figure 3A).32,33 This peak shift was also observed in our experimental results. The
amount of adsorbed GNRs was tuned by changing the adsorption time
(1, 10, and 60 min), and the extinction spectra of the GNRs at various
tilt angles under p-polarized light were recorded. The amounts of
adsorbed GNRs were determined as 300, 1000, and 2500 particles/μm2 by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry
(ICP-AES) for adsorption times of 1, 10, and 60 min, wherein the number
ratios of GNRs to DNA chains were 0.25, 0.83, and 2.1, respectively.
These values equate to the average center-to-center distances of the
adsorbed GNRs of approximately 62, 34, and 21 nm. To correlate average
GNR center-to-center distance to the LLSPR peak positions, the simulated
LLSPR peak positions were plotted as a function of the simulated GNR
center-to-center distance (Figure S4).
The experimentally observed LLSPR peak positions were around 780,
650, and 620 nm, and these positions corresponded to over 70, 30,
and 26 nm, respectively, on the basis of the correlation curve calculated
from the simulation. These values obtained from the extinction spectra
were also consistent with the values obtained from ICP-AES experiments.
Further, both the experimental results and simulation data showed
that this vertical alignment was independent of the amount of adsorbed
GNRs.

Figure 3 (A) Simulated extinction spectra of perfectly aligned GNRs with
various center-to-center distances under p-polarized light at θ
= 50°. (B, C) Extinction spectra of GNRs (1:4) on a DNA brush
under p-polarized light. The adsorption time was 10 min (B) or 1 min
(C). The center-to-center distances were calculated as 34 and 62 nm
for 1000 and 300 particles/μm2, respectively. The
peaks for the excited LLSPR in (B) and (C) are located around 650
and 780 nm.

To directly confirm the
GNR (1:4) orientation on the DNA brush,
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed.
In our first attempt to image the orientation of the GNRs, the sample
was simply dried and then imaged. However, this approach revealed
a strong peak for LLSPR, indicating that the GNRs did not align vertically
(Figure 4A). The FE-SEM
image also showed that their orientation was random (Figure 4B). The highly oriented GNR
structure had become more disordered during the drying process. This
structural change was thought to be caused by a lateral capillary
force during evaporation of the solvent and suggested that sufficient
free space existed around each GNR for them to lay flat. Therefore,
to avoid any structural changes induced by the drying process, we
employed an epoxy resin to stabilize the GNRs. The GNRs were first
embedded in the epoxy resin, which was subsequently decoupled from
the glass cuvette after solidification, and then imaged by FE-SEM.
Although the extinction spectra subtly changed before and after the
epoxy resin embedding process (Figure 4C), we observed the GNRs to be round (Figure 4D). The diameter of the round
GNRs is similar to that of their minor axis, as shown in Figure 4B, indicating that
the GNRs were generally aligned vertically.

buffer (pH = 7.7) and after the drying process. (B) FE-SEM image of
the adsorbed GNRs after the drying process. (C) Extinction spectra
of the GNRs on a DNA brush before and after the epoxy resin embedding
process. (D) FE-SEM image of the adsorbed GNRs in the epoxy resin.
The adsorption time was 60 min. The scale bar represents 100 nm in
both cases.

On the basis of the above
alignment, we believed that the charge
density on the GNRs affects their orientation as highly charged GNRs
can bend the DNA chains, leading to a random GNR orientation on the
DNA brush. Recently, Yingling and co-workers have simulated the conformational
change of 30 bp DNA induced by interaction with positively charged
spherical nanoparticles, with a diameter of ∼1.5 nm.34 According to their simulations, a high charge
density on the nanoparticles bends the DNA, and a low charge density
on the nanoparticles allows the nanoparticles to attach to the DNA
without bending. Although the DNA length and nanoparticle size and
shape in our experiment differed from those in the simulation, our
results can be similarly explained by the presence or absence of DNA
brush bending. In other words, the grafted DNA bends at the curved
surface of the highly cationic GNRs, leading to a random orientation
as the grafted DNA is no longer perfectly aligned. In contrast, when
GNRs with a low charge density were used, the grafted DNA did not
bend and the GNRs were absorbed unidirectionally along the axis of
the extended DNA brush.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated that the orientation of GNRs
can be controlled with the assistance of a dsDNA brush. This was achieved
by the simple electrostatics adsorption of positively charged GNRs
onto the DNA brush. Interestingly, the density of the positive charge
on the surface of the GNRs is important to their vertical alignment.
Our approach not only removes limits to the area of ordered GNRs in
theoretical terms but also provides a number of possibilities for
the control of metal nanorod orientation in more complex systems;
for example, the inclusion of colloidal particles on a nonflat surface.
Furthermore, by tuning the correlation between the length of the DNA
chains on the brush and the size of the metal nanorods, hierarchical
ordering of metal nanorods to create and tailor multifunctional systems
may be achieved. Our research provides new insights into the self-assembly
of anisotropic nanoparticles utilizing polymer configuration and electrostatic
attraction.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of GNRs
(1) Preparation
of the seed solution:
HAuCl4·3H2O (250 μL, 0.01 M) was
added to a CTAB aqueous solution (7.5 mL, 0.1 M) in a 50 mL plastic
tube. An ice-cold NaBH4 solution (600 μL, 0.01 M)
was injected while the plastic tube was shaken gently. The solution
was then left undisturbed for 2 h at 30 °C prior to use. (2)
Growth reaction: HAuCl4·3H2O (400 μL,
0.01 M), AgNO3 (240 μL, 0.01 M), and ascorbic acid
(64 μL, 0.1 M) were added to a CTAB aqueous solution (40 mL,
0.1 M) in a 100 mL plastic tube in the above order, with subsequent
injection of the seed solution (96 μL). The growth solution
was then shaken gently and left undisturbed for 3 h at 30 °C.
(3) Centrifugal purification: The synthesized GNRs solutions (1.5
mL) were transferred to a 1.7 mL plastic tube. The GNR solution was
concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation (18 000g, 20 min, 30 °C). Thereafter, all centrifugation was performed
under the same conditions. The GNR solutions were centrifuged, and
the supernatant (1.45 mL) was removed. The residue (50 μL) was
diluted with MilliQ (1.45 mL). This purification procedure was repeated
twice.

Surface Exchange of GNRs
Different amounts of two kinds
of alkanethiol ligands (the NH2EG6C11 and EG6C11 ligand)
were mixed in methanol. The ratios of the ligands were 5:0, 4:1, 3:2,
2:3, and 1:4 in a total alkanethiol ligand concentration of 5 mM.
The mixed alkanethiol ligand solution (50 μL) was added to the
purified GNR solution (1.45 μL). The mixed solution was purified
by two cycles of centrifugation, as described above. Finally, the
mixed ligand GNR solution was concentrated to 25 nM, as determined
by the ICP-AES measurement.

Preparation of Streptavidin-Coated Substrates
A glass
cuvette was cleaned with piranha solution (a 3:1 mixture of concentrated
H2SO4 with H2O2) for 1
h, with subsequent rinsing in MilliQ, and dried in an incubator (60
°C). The cleaned glass cuvette was placed in a N2-filled
glovebox, and the inside surface of the cuvette was immersed in 0.01%
v/v superdehydrated toluene of CMETS. A silane coupling reaction was
performed for 1 h, followed by rinsing with acetone, ethanol, and
MilliQ. After washing, the surface methoxy group was hydrolyzed by
treatment with concentrated HCl for 16 h. To immobilize the biotin,
the hydrolyzed glass cuvette was soaked in a 10 mM HEPES-KOH buffer
solution (pH = 7.4) containing EDC (50 mM) and amine-PEG2-biotin (1 mM) for 1 h. Finally, streptavidin was immobilized onto
the glass cuvette via streptavidin–biotin interaction by incubating the biotinylated
surface with a pH 7.7 Tris–HCl buffer containing streptavidin
(100 μg/mL) for 1 h.

PCR Reaction for the Synthesis of 148 bp
DNA
For 148
bp DNA brush preparation, 148 bp DNA was synthesized by a standard
PCR method using λ-DNA as a template and a pair of 5′-modified
primers (22 base biotin primer and 21 base Alexa 647 primer). 22 base
biotin primer (10 μM), 21 base alexa 647 primer (10 μM),
and λ-DNA (0.20 μg/μL) were mixed in a ratio of
1:1:1. Then, the primer–template mixed solution, MilliQ, and
Quick Taq HS DyeMix were mixed at a ratio of 3:22:25. Thermal cycling
was carried out as follows: for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 20
cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 1 min at 68
°C. After the reaction, the products were cooled to 4 °C.
The products were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit to
remove the nonpolymerized primers.

Preparation of a DNA Brush
and Adsorption of GNRs
The
synthesized 148 bp DNA was immobilized by soaking the streptavidin-coated
cuvette in a pH 7.7 Tris–HCl buffer containing 100 nM DNA and
1000 mM NaCl. The GNRs modified with the alkanethiol ligands were
attached by soaking the inside surface of the DNA brush cuvettes in
the GNR solution. After that, the inside surface of the cuvette was
washed with pH 7.7 Tris–HCl at least three times to remove
the nonattached GNRs.

Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) Calculation
We
estimated the optical properties of the perfectly aligned GNR structure
using an electromagnetic optical simulation on the basis of the FDTD
method. The FDTD method solves Maxwell’s equations by discretizing
the equations via central differences in time and space and then numerically
solving these equations using software. For simplicity, we have assumed
that the GNRs were arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The effect of
the solvent has been accounted for by the refractive index of the
ambient environment, that is, n = 1.333 for water.

Quantitative Analysis of the Amount of Adsorbed GNRs
The
adsorbed GNRs were dissolved with aqua regia (HNO3/HCl
= 1:3). The amount of gold contained in the aqua regia was quantitatively
analyzed by ICP-AES. For simplicity, we considered the GNRs (34 nm
× 10 nm) as cylinders and estimated the density of the adsorbed
GNRs on the DNA brush surface.

Embedding of the Adsorbed
GNRs in Epoxy Resin
EPON812
RESIN, DDSA, and MNA were mixed in a ratio of 4.6, 2.6, and 2.8, and
subsequently stirred for 20 min. DMP-30 was then added into the mixed
solution. After stirring for 60 min, the resin solution was degassed
under vacuum for 1 h. The mixture was applied on the adsorbed GNRs
and left at 60 °C for 3 days for solidification. The solidified
epoxy resin was decoupled from the cuvette and coated with carbon
(10–20 nm).
