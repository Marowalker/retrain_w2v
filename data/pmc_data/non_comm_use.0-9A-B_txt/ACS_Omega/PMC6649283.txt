Low-temperature
synthesis of multilayer graphene (MLG) is essential
for combining advanced electronic devices with carbon materials. We
investigated the vapor-phase synthesis of MLG by sputtering deposition
of C atoms on metal-coated insulators. Ni, Co, and Fe catalysts, which
have high C solid solubility, enabled us to form MLG at 400 °C.
The domain size and surface coverage of MLG were determined by the
supplied amount of C atoms and the thickness of the metal layer associated
with the solid solution amount of C. An average domain size of 2.5
μm and surface coverage of approximately 50% were obtained for
a 1 μm thick Ni layer. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated
the high crystalline quality of the MLG layer despite the low processing
temperature. Therefore, this simple sputtering technique has great
potential for integrating graphene-based devices on various platforms.

Introduction
Multilayer graphene (MLG) is expected
to be applied to low-resistance
wiring, heat spreaders, and anodes for lithium-ion batteries because
of its high electrical/thermal conductivities, current-carrying capacity,
and specific capacity.1−4 To make use of these features, it is essential to incorporate MLG
into existing devices such as large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs)
or flat-panel displays.5,6 To achieve this, MLG needs to
be synthesized at low temperatures to prevent damaging the underlying
devices (e.g., approximately 500 °C for LSIs and a glass substrate).
Low-temperature synthesis of MLG on arbitrary substrates has been
achieved through vapor-phase7−14 and solid-phase crystallization15,16 processes
using metal catalysts. These techniques utilize a phenomenon in which
carbon atoms dissolved in the metal are precipitated as graphene.17 Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was the most
common method for MLG synthesis.7−12 However, because CVD requires high temperature for gas decomposition,
devices such as plasma aiding are necessary to avoid raising the temperature
of the sample.

Sputtering is a very simple method and is commercially
superior.
Metal-induced solid-phase crystallization of sputtered amorphous carbon
(a-C) films,18,19 particularly via layer exchange,20−22 is useful for fabricating thick MLG films on arbitrary substrates.
Conversely, there are a few reports on the vapor-phase crystallization
of MLG using the sputtering method, whereas the vapor-phase crystallization
is generally more advantageous for lowering the synthesis temperature
than solid-phase crystallization.23 In
this study, we explored the possibility of low-temperature vapor-phase
synthesis of MLG by sputtering with metal catalysis. The metals with
high carbon solid solubility allowed MLG synthesis at 400 °C.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
The sample preparation procedure
is shown in Figure 1. (1) Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu (thickness: 50–1000 nm) were deposited
on a SiO2 glass substrate at room temperature (RT). (2)
The sample temperature was raised to 400 °C in 20 min and kept
at 400 °C for 40 min to heat the sample uniformly. (3) C was
sputtered on the metals for 1.4–27.3 min with a deposition
rate of 2.2 nm/min. (4) The sample was naturally cooled to RT (for
3.5 h). All depositions were performed using radiofrequency (RF) magnetron
sputtering (base pressure: 3.0 × 10–4 Pa) with
Ar plasma. The RF power was set to 50 W for the metals and 100 W for
C.

Material Characterization
The Raman spectroscopy was
performed using a JASCO NRS-5100, whose laser wavelength was 532 nm
and spot size was 1 μm. The Nomarski optical micrographs of
the sample surface were obtained at a magnification of 1000×.
Here, the MLG coverage was calculated using binarization processing
on these micrographs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses
were performed using a JEOL JSM-7001F with an energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectrometer (JEOL JEO-2300). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analyses were performed using an analytical TEM, FEI Tecnai
Osiris operating at 200 kV, equipped with an EDX spectrometer (FEI
Super-X system) and a high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM system
with a probe diameter of less than 1 nm.

Results and Discussion
We examined Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu as metal catalyst layers for sputtering
synthesis of MLG because these metals are typically used for graphene
synthesis.19,22Figure 2a–d shows that all samples have black
spots on the surfaces after sputtering. Figure 2e shows that the black spots for the Fe,
Co, and Ni samples exhibit peaks at approximately 1350, 1580, and
2700 cm–1, which correspond to the D (disordered
mode), G (graphitic mode), and two-dimensional (D mode overtone) peaks
in the graphitic structure.24 Conversely,
no Raman peaks were obtained from the bright area in these samples.
Therefore, the black spots in the Fe, Co, and Ni samples were determined
to be MLG. In contrast, for the Cu sample, a broad peak corresponding
to a-C was obtained on the entire surface. From the observation using
transmitted light, the black spots in the Cu sample were determined
to be holes due to the agglomeration of the Cu layer. Therefore, the
MLG was formed on the Fe, Co, and Ni layers but not on the Cu layer.
This is because the solid solubility of C in Cu is much lower than
that in the other metals.25 Generally,
the D band intensity of MLG increases as the synthesis temperature
decreases.12,22 Because the synthesis temperature
of the current MLG is as low as 400 °C, disorders in MLG would
be responsible for the large D band intensity (Figure 2e). The MLG domains are the largest for the
Ni sample. Figure 2f,g shows that the domain size of the Ni sample is approximately
1 μm. Thus, MLG was synthesized at a low temperature of 400
°C by sputtering using metal catalysts with high solid solubility
of C.

We investigated the effect of
the thickness of C and Ni (tC and tNi) on MLG’s
growth properties. We note that tC corresponds
to the product of C deposition time and deposition rate (2.2 nm/min). Figure 3a shows that the
surface morphology, i.e., the domain size and surface coverage of
MLG, varies with both tC and tNi. For tC = 60 nm and tNi ≤ 200 nm, it was difficult to verify
the MLG domain, which was likely because of thick a-C layers, as determined
by the Raman study. The a-C layers were formed by the deposition of
C atoms that cannot be dissolved in the thin Ni layers. We note that
the D band intensity in the Raman spectra did not change with tC until the surface was covered by a-C. Figure 3b shows that the
MLG domain size roughly increases with increasing tC except for tC = 3 nm. The
sample with tC = 3 nm and tNi = 1000 nm exhibits the maximum domain size of 2.5 μm.
This means that adding a small amount of C to a thick Ni layer is
effective to obtain MLG with a large domain. Figure 3c shows that the MLG coverage increases with
increasing tC. The coverage does not depend
on tNi for tC ≤ 20 nm, whereas it increases with increasing tNi for tC ≥ 40 nm.
The maximum coverage of approximately 50% is obtained for tC = 60 nm and tNi = 1000 nm. This is likely because a thicker Ni layer can dissolve
more C atoms. In addition to increasing tC and tNi, optimizing the cooling rate
will be also effective in improving the surface coverage.18 Thus, the domain size and surface coverage of
MLG were determined by the supplied amount of C atoms and the amount
of C that Ni can dissolve. We tried to measure the MLG thickness using
atomic force microscopy; however, it was difficult to identify MLG
due to the Ni surface roughness. Considering that the amount of precipitated
MLG depends on the solid solution amount of C in Ni, the MLG thickness
will show a similar tendency to the surface coverage of MLG (Figure 3c). Generally, the
surface of the MLG precipitated from metals has only C–C bonds
and no functional group such as C–O bonds.4 Therefore, the current MLG surface also seems to have no
functional groups and consists of C–C bonds.

of MLG. (a) Nomarski optical
micrographs for the matrix composed of tC and tNi. (b) Domain size and (c) surface
coverage of MLG as a function of tC, which
were calculated by binarizing the optical micrographs.

We investigated the detailed cross-sectional structure
of the sample
for tC = 60 nm and tNi = 1000 nm, which has the maximum MLG coverage (Figure 3). The bright-field
TEM images and EDX mapping in Figure 4a–c show that the MLG domains with various sizes
are locally formed on the Ni layer, which is consistent with the optical
micrograph (Figure 3a). The Ni concentration in the MLG domain is below the detection
limit of EDX as in the other precipitation methods. The entire sample
surface is covered with sparse a-C, which could not dissolve in Ni.
These TEM images also suggest that the MLG domains grew from the surface
steps, i.e., grain boundaries in the Ni layer. This phenomenon is
reasonable because the grain boundary diffusion is much faster than
lattice diffusion and similar to other MLG precipitation methods.15,16 The dark-field TEM image and the selected-area electron diffraction
pattern in Figure 4d reveal that the MLG domain is a single crystalline layer and {002}-oriented
parallel to the substrate. The high-resolution TEM image in Figure 4e clearly shows that
the graphene layers are stacked and completely {002}-oriented. Although
the presence of disorders is suggested from the Raman results (Figure 2e), the MLG domain
contains no obvious defects, such as dislocations or stacking faults.

Conclusions
This sputtering method using metal catalysts
enabled MLG to be
formed at 400 °C. The domain size and surface coverage of MLG
were determined by the supplied amount of C atoms and the Ni layer
thickness associated with the solid solution amount of C. The maximum
domain size and surface coverage of MLG were approximately 2.5 μm
and 50%, respectively. Further investigations into the cooling rate,
RF power, and Ni structure will allow us to improve the domain size
and surface coverage or control the domain location. The findings
in this study should encourage studies exploring the low-temperature
synthesis of MLG using a simple sputtering method.
