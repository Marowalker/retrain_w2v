An efficient Cu(II)-catalyzed and
tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB)-promoted
strategy for highly regioselective and chemoselective C(sp3)–H acyloxylation of aliphatic amides is described. Acyloxylation
occurs selectively at the β position with a broad substrate
scope of carboxylic acids and aliphatic amides and good functional
group compatibility. Notably, the competing reaction of intramolecular
dehydrogenative amidation and intermolecular acyloxylation could be
efficiently controlled by the amount of copper salt and the addition
of TBAB. The intramolecular dehydrogenative amidation product was
obtained in high yield when the amount of copper salts was increased.
However, when TBAB was used as an additive, a preference for acyloxylation
over intramolecular amidation was observed and the acyloxylated products
were obtained in good yield. Preliminary studies were carried out
to gain insights into the mechanism.

Introduction
Transition metal-catalyzed
C(sp2)–H functionalization
via a directing group auxiliary has been extensively developed in
the past decade.1 In contrast to the direct
functionalization of the C(sp2)–H bond, direct functionalization
of an unactivated C(sp3)–H bond has been less researched
because of the high bond dissociation energy of the C(sp3)–H bond and lack of π electrons that can readily interact
with transition metals.2 Directing group-assisted
transition metal-catalyzed C(sp3)–H functionalization
has emerged as a powerful method to overcome the tremendous challenges.3 Recently, various precious metal-catalyzed C(sp3)–H activations have been extensively explored with
the assistance of a monodentate or bidentate directing group.4 Although significant advances have been made
with precious metal catalysts, the development of low-cost and environmentally
benign first-row transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu is still
in high demand.5

8-Aminoquinoline
developed by Daugulis’ group has been proven
to be a powerful bidentate auxiliary in transition metal-catalyzed
direct C–H bond activation,3a,3b,6 and it has been used in stereoselective as well as
regioselective C–H functionalization reactions.7 Palladium-catalyzed and nickel-catalyzed C(sp3)–H functionalization by using an 8-aminoquinoline bidentate
auxiliary has been applied extensively,4c,5b,8,9 whereas the chelation-assisted
examples involving copper catalysts are rare. Recently, Kanai, You,
and Ge have demonstrated the copper-catalyzed intramolecular amidation
of C(sp3)–H bonds,10 and
the reaction provides a protocol for functionalization at β-C(sp3)–H bonds in a highly regioselective manner. Ge also
reported copper-promoted cross-dehydrogenative coupling of aliphatic
amides and polyfluoroarenes by using an 8-aminoquinoline as the directing
group.11 Intermolecular amination of β-C(sp3)–H bonds was reported by Qin5f and Yang12 by using simple alkylamines
as the amino source.

The development of C–O bond formation
reactions has greatly
accelerated in recent years following landmark reports on Pd-catalyzed
C(sp3)–H acetoxylation reactions by the Sanford13 and Yu14 laboratories
using different organic oxidants.15,16 In 2013, Roane
and Daugulis reported the first copper-catalyzed 8-aminoquinoline-directed
C–H to C–O transformation.17 Recently, the copper-promoted direct acetoxylation and acyloxylation
of β-C(sp3)–H bonds with the assistance of
an 8-aminoquinoline bidentate directing group have also been reported.18 However, a large amount of oxidants, the limited
substrate scope, and harsh reaction conditions have prevented the
synthetic applications. Continuing our research efforts in the development
of novel copper-catalyzed C–H acyloxylation,19 herein we report a highly efficient method for copper-catalyzed
and Bu4N+-promoted regioselective and chemoselective
β-C(sp3)–H acyloxylation of aliphatic amides
with carboxylic acids including aromatic acids, cinnamic acids, heterocyclic
carboxylic acids, and aliphatic acids (Scheme 1b).

Scheme 1 (a,b) Copper-Catalyzed β-C(sp3)–H Acyloxylation
and Amidation of Aliphatic Amides
Results and Discussion
On the basis of our previous
direct acyloxylation of C(sp2)–H bonds (Scheme 1), we began our study
by conducting β-C(sp3)–H acyloxylation of
2,2-dimethyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)butanamide
substrate 1a with benzoic acid in the presence of CuBr
(30 mol %) and Ag2CO3 (2 equiv) in toluene/dimethylformamide
(DMF) at 140 °C under air for 12 h. We were pleased to observe
that acyloxylation of β-C(sp3)–H bonds afforded
a mixture of monoacyloxylated products 3aa and diacyloxylated
products 3aa′ in 1:1 ratio with a combined yield
of 41% and the intramolecular amidated product 4a in
18% yield, and the acyloxylation of γ-methyl group C–H
bonds with benzoic acid was not observed. Interestingly, the yield
of the intramolecular amidated product was increased with an increase
in the amount of CuBr (Table 1, entries 1–3) and afforded 4a in 80%
yield in the absence of benzoic acid by using stoichiometric copper
salts (entry 4). To our surprise, employing phase-transfer catalysts
such as tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as an additive led to a
dramatic improvement in the yield of the acyloxylated product 3a and absolutely inhibited the intramolecular amidated reaction
(entry 5). Encouraged by this result, a series of copper salts such
as CuI, CuBr2, CuCl2·2H2O, Cu(OAc)2·H2O, Cu(OCOCF3)2, and
CuSO4·5H2O were then screened, which showed
that the reaction could be catalyzed by either a copper(II) or copper(I)
and Cu(OCOCF3)2 proved to be the best catalyst
(entries 6–11). The absence of a copper catalyst or an oxidant
fails to generate the desired products, which indicated that the copper
catalyst and oxidant played indispensable roles in this reaction (entries
12 and 13). Various oxidants, such as AgOAc, AgOCOCF3,
and K2S2O8, were tested, and Ag2CO3 was determined to be especially effective (entries
14–16). A brief survey of reaction media showed that the reaction
in toluene/DMF gave the best result, whereas toluene, DMF, and chlorobenzene
only led to low yields (see the Supporting Information for more details). Instead of TBAB, the use of some other additives
such as tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) or tetrabutylammonium chloride
(TBAC) had no obvious influence on the reaction efficiency (entries
17 and 18, see the Supporting Information for more details). When the reaction was performed at 130 and 150
°C, 3a was isolated in 52 and 72% yield (entries
19 and 20). Further investigation showed that a similar yield could
be obtained under Ar atmosphere (entry 21). Herein, we chose entry
20 as the optimized reaction conditions.

With an optimized
catalytic system in hand, we investigated the
scope of this acyloxylation reaction by using a series of acids. As
shown in Table 2, substitution
patterns and electronic properties of the phenyl ring of the benzoic
acids and cinnamic acids had no obvious influence on the reaction
efficiency (3aa–3aj, 3am–3ap). A range of benzoic acids bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups at either the 2-, 3-, or 4-position of the aromatic ring underwent
the desired reaction smoothly to give the corresponding products in
moderate yield (3ab–3ad, 3af–3ah). Notably, 2-naphthoic acid, thiophene-2-carboxylic acid, and aliphatic
acids were also well tolerated and gave the desired product in moderate
yield (3ak, 3al, 3aq, and 3ar).

Ag2CO3 (2 equiv), TBAB
(1 equiv), solvent (2 mL): toluene/DMF (1:1), in air.

To further explore the generality
of this protocol, we investigated
the scope of aliphatic amides with benzoic acid. Although Cu(OCOCF3)2 exhibited considerable reactivity with CuSO4·5H2O (Table 1), its applicability to other aliphatic amides was
unsatisfactory. Therefore, we choose CuSO4·5H2O as the catalyst to investigate the substrate scope (Table 3). A high selectivity
of the β-methyl groups over γ- or δ-methyl was observed
and methylene or benzene C–H bonds were not acyloxylated. Interestingly,
the acyloxylation of aliphatic amide 1b showed significant
electronic effects. Benzoic acid with an electron-donating group exhibited
excellent reactivity rather than an electron-withdrawing substituent
on the para-position of the aryl ring (3bb and 3bc). We were pleased to found that a wide variety of aliphatic
amides bearing both linear (3ba–3ja) and cyclic
chains (3ka and 3la) were compatible with
this protocol. However, the acyloxylation of 1-methyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)cyclohexane-1-carboxamide 1o was not
observed because of the steric effect, and the spiro-β-lactam 4o was obtained.

Then, we investigated the effects
of the directing group on the
efficiency of the acyloxylation reaction (Scheme 2). No reaction occurred when amide 5a or 6a was used as the substrate, indicating
that the presence of a bidentate directing group is crucial for the
C–H bond activation and the formation of a five-membered ring
intermediate is favorable in cyclometalation step.

Scheme 2 Effects of the Directing
Group
To gain insights into the reaction
pathway of copper-catalyzed
acyloxylation, a series of additional experiments were carried out
as shown in Scheme 3. The addition of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) in
the control experiment essentially suppressed the reaction, and only
a trace amount of the desired product 3aa was detected
when the amount of TEMPO was increased to 3 equiv (Scheme 3, eq 1). These results suggested
that the reaction probably involves a radical pathway. The deuterium-labeling
experiments were carried out to further explore the reaction mechanism.
It was noticed that there was no apparent H/D exchange in this process
and the result suggested the C–H bond metalation step to be
not reversible in nature (Scheme 3, eq 2). A kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) experiment
was also conducted and the KIE value was calculated to be 2.8, indicating
that the C–H cleavage was probably involved in the rate-determining
step of the reaction (Scheme 3, eq 3). However, the role of TBAB is still not clear; the
exact reaction mechanism remains uncertain at present.

and Deuterium-Labeling Experiments
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the
copper(II)/Bu4N+-catalyzed β-C(sp3)–H acyloxylation
of aliphatic amides. A high regioselectivity of the β-methyl
groups over γ- or δ-methyl and methylene was observed.
This method by using the catalytic amount of copper and Bu4N+ could effectively reduce the procedure of C(sp3)–N bond formation. This protocol exhibits a wide substrate
scope of carboxylic acids and aliphatic amides and good functional
group compatibility, providing an operationally simple approach for
the formation of C(sp3)–O bond and C(sp3)–N bond.

Experimental Section
General Information
All starting materials and reagents
were commercially available and used directly without further purification.
All aliphatic amides were prepared according to the literature procedures.12,20 All known products gave satisfactory analytical data by NMR spectra,
corresponding to the reported literature values. In addition, unknown
compounds were confirmed by high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS). Melting
points were determined using X-4 micro melting point apparatus and
are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on
a Bruker Avance-300, Bruker Avance-400, and Bruker Avance-500 at 300,
400, and 500 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.
Chemical shifts are given in δ relative to TMS; the coupling

on Agilent 6200 LC/MS TOF using electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive
mode.

General Procedure for Copper-Catalyzed C(sp3)–H
Acyloxylation
To a 10 mL reaction tube were added amide 1a (24.2 mg, 0.1 mmol), benzoic acid (24.4 mg, 0.2 mmol),
Cu(OCOCF3)2 (8.7 mg, 30 mol %) or CuSO4·5H2O (7.5 mg, 30 mol %), Ag2CO3 (55.1 mg, 2 equiv), TBAB (32.2 mg, 1 equiv) or TBAC (27.8 mg, 1
equiv), and toluene/DMF (1 mL/1 mL) in air. The mixture was stirred
at 150 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room
temperature, diluted with ethyl acetate, and quenched with saturated
sodium chloride. The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate
(3 × 10 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4. After concentration, the resulting residue was purified
by flash chromatography on silica gel with petroleum ether/ethyl acetate
(20:1) as the eluent to afford the product.
