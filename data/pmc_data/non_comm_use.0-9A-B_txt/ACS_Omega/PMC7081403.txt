On-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs),
integrated with energy harvesters,
hold substantial promise for developing self-powered wireless sensor
systems. However, MSCs have conventionally been manufactured through
techniques incompatible with semiconductor fabrication technology,
the most significant bottleneck being the electrode deposition technique.
Utilization of spin-coating for electrode deposition has shown potential
to deliver several complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor
(CMOS)-compatible MSCs on a silicon substrate. Yet, their limited
electrochemical performance and yield over the substrate have remained
challenges obstructing their subsequent integration. We report a facile
surface roughening technique for improving the wafer yield and the
electrochemical performance of CMOS-compatible MSCs, specifically
for reduced graphene oxide as an electrode material. A 4 nm iron layer
is deposited and annealed on the wafer substrate to increase the roughness
of the surface. In comparison to standard nonroughened MSCs, the increase
in surface roughness leads to a 78% increased electrode thickness,
21% improvement in mass retention, 57% improvement in the uniformity
of the spin-coated electrodes, and a high yield of 87% working devices
on a 2″ silicon substrate. Furthermore, these improvements
directly translate to higher capacitive performance with enhanced
rate capability, energy, and power density. This technique brings
us one step closer to fully integrable CMOS-compatible MSCs in self-powered
systems for on-chip wireless sensor electronics.

1 Introduction
Intelligent
wireless sensors are currently being used in several
domains such as structural health monitoring through motion, strain,
and temperature sensors;1 physical and
chemical sensing of biosignals;2 damage
detection in food and agriculture;3 and
in smartphones.4 These sensors comprise
four functional units—sensing, processing, communications,
and a power unit. Powering these sensors is a critical issue that
influences their application and architecture. Batteries are the standard
method, but they restrict the device lifetime and incur costs for
replacements.5 Supercapacitors have demonstrated
a higher power density and a longer life cycle compared to conventional
batteries.6 Supercapacitors are energy
storage devices that generally use the physical separation of electrical
charges in the electrode and electrolyte to store energy. Batteries
could potentially be replaced by pairing on-chip supercapacitors called
micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with energy harvesters that convert energy
from sources present in an ambient environment, such as thermal, vibrational,
or acoustic energy.7

Successful integration
of MSCs in a fully integrated circuit (IC)-compatible
process scheme can lead to an on-chip power supply that will ease
the power requirements of microsystems and improve their lifetime.
A fully IC-compatible process requires some specific constraints regarding
the choice of material and equipment for thin-film formation, photolithography,
and etching.

MSCs have been fabricated through a variety of
techniques such
as chemical vapor deposition,8,9 screen printing,10 ink-jet printing,11 laser scribing,12 electrostatic spray
deposition,13 electrophoretic deposition,14 chemical exfoliation,15 doctor blade coating,7 and spin-coating.16 Spin-coating has the advantage of already being
an established conventional part of standard metal–oxide–semiconductor
(CMOS) processing, implying that it is as such inherently CMOS-/MEMS-compatible.
Although ink-jet printing, spray-coating, and laser scribing can also
be considered CMOS-compatible, there are several issues that need
to be considered before they can provide effective wafer yield and
high pattern resolution. Ink-jet printing, screen printing, and laser
scribing have a raster scanning process which generates potential
bottlenecks in the fabrication process. Recently, the tools for spray-coating
have been set up in IC foundries owing to their flexibility in using
various liquid solutions with varying properties and acquiring complex
geometries, including high capacity for good step coverage.17 However, the spray-coating equipment is complex
and expensive and produces a high amount of waste solution. Also,
recently, there have been some significant questions regarding the
reproducibility and uniformity with more complex automation.18 Chemical vapor deposition, one of the most promising
techniques for CMOS-compatible processes, suffers from nonuniform
wafer growth.19 Thus, in view of the expected
further automation in IC manufacturing,20 its compatibility advantage makes spin-coating a strong candidate
for being the preferred MSC manufacturing technique, provided it can
demonstrate that it can produce devices of sufficient quality and
yield.

In the past years, the focus on spin-coated MSCs for
flexible substrates
has increased substantially. Wu et al.21 reported a flexible MSC with high energy density using water-dispensable
graphene oxide (GO) with sulfonated polyaniline (GO/SP) as an electrode
material through a combination of spin-coating, shadow masking, and
plasma etching. The method demonstrated a thick GO/SP layer with a
high volumetric capacitance. Similar efforts have been made for fabricating
MSCs through shadow masking.22−25 However, the use of a stencil shadow mask requires
alignment precision that is performed manually. Similarly, Shen et
al.26 fabricated MSCs based on silica nanocomposites
by pyrolysing a mixture of SU-8 thick photoresist and nanocomposites
at 900 °C. The carbonization of photoresist to form thick electrodes
has been termed as carbon-MEMS (C-MEMS).27,28 Along with spin-coating, C-MEMS demonstrates the best potential
of CMOS-compatible MSC fabrication. However, the pyrolysing temperature
must be checked as most CMOS processes cannot go beyond a maximum
temperature of 600 °C. More recently, Wu et al.29 fabricated GO-based electrodes through spin-coating. The
current collectors were evaporated on top of the spin-coated film
through photolithography, followed by lift-off. Similar studies30−32 have also utilized the spin-coating technique for MSC fabrication.
The main issue with the deposition of current collectors on top is
that the electrolyte penetration suffers, leading to a largely resistive
behavior at high scan rates. In this regard, Smith et al.33 demonstrate a feasible CMOS-compatible spin-coating
fabrication technique that allows for electrolyte penetration in the
entire electrode regions while having the current collectors at the
bottom of the deposited electrode layer.

These spin-coated MSCs,
however, suffer from poor adhesion and
uniformity which leads to a poor performance with regard to charge
retention as well as energy and power density. These parameters can
be improved by enhancing the surface structure through substrate roughening.
The primary effect of the surface structure on wettability has been
established since the works of Wenzel34 and Cassie and Baxter.35 Both models
have emphasized the improved wettability through surface roughness.
This has been further modeled and experimentally described by Kubiak
et al.36 They concluded that surface roughness
had a strong influence over the apparent contact angle of the spin-coated
liquid, which improved the wettability. Similarly, Hsieh et al.37 experimentally demonstrated an improved contact
angle and surface coverage of oil-like fluid with the use of nanoparticles.
Ryu et al. demonstrated an improved wettability on Si surfaces through
linked copolymer coating of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) on the
substrate.38 Use of nonconductive PMMA
between the current collectors and electrode layer will have a negative
impact on the conductivity of the device. Therefore, solutions that
improve the roughness of the substrate surface without affecting the
device resistance are imperative. Monolayer colloidal crystals on
Si and Au surfaces have also been recently used as surface roughness
agents for etching and fabrication of super wet surfaces.39 Furthermore, for improved structural control,
techniques such as monodisperse polystyrene beads, nanoimprint lithography,
and chemical etching have also been utilized to increase the roughness
of a substrate surface.40 MSCs fabricated
on a rough surface by Vyas et al.41 by
annealing a thin hydrophilic film (Fe) below the current collectors
combine the above-mentioned techniques to form a surface behaving
as the nanoparticle layer. They have demonstrated equivalent capacitive
behavior to the MSC fabricated on a smooth SiO2 surface
in initial measurements.

This paper focuses on these results
for surface roughening through
analysis of surface-enhanced and standard MSCs fabricated on separate
2″ Si substrates. The surface-enhanced (SE) Si substrate used
for the fabrication of MSCs had an extra layer of Fe of 4 nm, annealed
at a temperature of 600 °C for 4 min to develop nanoparticles.
MSCs were electrochemically analyzed, and the results demonstrate
the better capacitive performance of the surface enhanced over standard
MSCs in a range of devices with different electrode areas, all fabricated
through a scalable CMOS-compatible process.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
The GO solution used for
spin-coating was purchased from Graphene Supermarket. The solution
was diluted with deionized (DI) water to 3 g/L and then sonicated
for 15 min at 80 °C in 35 kHz sonication. The sonication before
spin-coating dissociated the graphene platelets from stacking and
aggregation. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfony)imide
(EMIM-TFSI) was chosen as the electrolyte for two main reasons—first
due to a higher operational window than aqueous electrolytes42 and second due to its superior conductivity
and electrochemical and thermal stability over other ionic liquid
electrolytes.43,44 Moreover, EMIM-TFSI has demonstrated
a high energy density capability with graphene-based MSC electrodes.45

2.2 Surface Enhancement Study
A 2″
Si/SiO2 substrate was diced into 1 cm × 1 cm chips.
The chips were divided into three categories—SE, Ar-enhanced
(ArE), and standard control (C) chips (kept unoptimized). SE chips
had a Fe layer evaporated on them of different thicknesses—2,
3, and 4 nm. They were then annealed at 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C
for 5 min each. The chips demonstrating the highest surface roughness
were chosen for the evaporation of the current collectors. The ArE
chips had an annealed Fe layer from the most roughened chip, that
is, 4 nm thick layer annealed at 600 °C, with an Au/Ti layer
evaporated on them. This was performed to emulate the actual fabricated
device. They were prepared by treating the chips under an Ar plasma
(40 sccm) in a PlasmaTherm ICP for 3–9 min with 1 min intervals.
The Ar plasma in the process chamber was directed on the substrate
with a radio frequency (RF) of 13.56 MHz at 100 W.

2.3 Fabrication of Reduced GO-Based MSCs
Figure 1a shows the
schematic process plan for the MSC fabrication. Fabrication of the
SE and control MSCs is performed on 2″ Si substrates with a
400 nm thermally grown layer of SiO2. A 4 nm Fe layer was
evaporated at a load pressure of 5 × 10–8 Torr
using an e-beam evaporator (Kurt Lesker PVD225). The substrate was
then annealed in a furnace at 600 °C for 5 min with a load–unload
temperature of 150 °C and a 10 °C/min ramp-up temperature.
A positive resist, S-1813 (micro-resist technology Gmbh), was spin-coated
on the two substrates, SE and control, and then UV-exposed with a
repromask designed for the MSC current collectors. The current collector
metals, Au/Ti, were evaporated for thicknesses of 100 and 20 nm, respectively.
The Ti metal film acts as an adhesion promoter and a diffusion barrier.
The photoresist was lifted off in an mr-REM400 remover (micro-resist
technology Gmbh) under the ultrasonication of 35 kHz in 55 min. GO
was then spin-coated on the two substrates at an angular velocity
of 1000 rpm with an acceleration of 1000 rpms for 60 s. This spin-coating
process was repeated five times at the same velocity and acceleration.
After subsequent spin-coatings, the spin-coated solution was hard
baked in a 100 °C oven. Furthermore, a layer of Al of 70 nm was
evaporated on the GO-laden substrates. The thin Al film served as
a hard mask for etching the GO material from the inverse interdigitated
pattern after a lithography step using photoresist S1813 (Rohm and
Haas Electronic Materials). The exposed Al was etched using a mixture
of Cl2 and SiCl4 with Ar gas as a catalyst for
the reaction in the dry-ICP plasma (Oxford Systems). The exposed GO
was then etched by O2 flowing at 80 sccm with an RF power
of 100 W. Finally, the Al hard mask was removed by etching the 70
nm film using the same gas mixture as before. A laser camera was set
up over the ion etching tool to end the Al etch automatically as soon
as the laser detected the GO surface. The end point is measured by
the intensity of the reflected laser. As soon as the reflective Al
surface is etched, the intensity of the reflected wave drops, denoting
the end of Al etching. This process took approx. 6 min for etching.
The GO underneath the hard mask was annealed in a high-temperature
furnace at 600 °C for 5 min with the same ramp-up and -down temperatures
as the Fe-annealing step. The fabricated substrates were then diced
for individual MSC performance analysis using EMIM-TFSI as the electrolyte. Figure 1b shows the interdigitated
electrodes of one of the fabricated MSCs.

2.4 Device Design
The fabricated substrates
had several MSC designs based on the number of fingers and distances
between them. The naming convention in the paper is nF-d, where n is the number of fingers
and d is the spacing between the positive and negative
electrodes in micrometers. The total material surface area for all
the designs is 0.21 cm2, while the total active surface
area for the electrodes varies with the width (w)
and d. The thickness of the electrodes is assigned
as tel. An in-depth study for control
MSCs on a SiO2 substrate has been performed by Li et al.46

2.5 Process Characterization
The roughness
of all the samples for the surface enhancement experiments was analyzed
using an atomic force microscope (SPM Bruker Dimension, 3100) in a
1 μm × 1 μm window. The mean roughness of the surface
(RA) was analyzed through a tapping mode
with a cantilever of 285 kHz resonance frequency. RA is the arithmetic average of the absolute values of
the profile height deviations from the mean line, recorded within
the evaluation length.

The fabrication process of the C- and
SE-MSCs was analyzed using an optical microscope (Olympus SZH-11)
during fabrication. The quality of the GO material was analyzed using
a Raman microscope with a 638 nm laser and a spectrometer with 1200
lines/mm gratings. The Raman spectrum of the material after the reduction
process shows two major features, the G band due to the E2g symmetry of sp2 carbon at 1587 cm–1 and the D band corresponding to the breathing mode of the A1g symmetry at 1338 cm–1. The intensity ratio
of D to G band (ID/IG) is 1.39, similar to a previous report on reduced GO (rGO).47 The thickness of the spin-coated rGO layers
on the fabricated substrates was measured using a Dektak surface profiler.
The surface morphologies of the devices were measured using a scanning
electron microscope (JSM-7610F Schottky field emission), shown in Figure 1d at a scanning acceleration
voltage of 1–5 kV with a probe current of 6 μA.

2.6 Electrochemical Measurement
The MSCs
fabricated with the SE and C substrates were evaluated on a Karl Süss
PM 5 probe station coupled with a Gamry Reference 3000AE potentiostat.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) at scan rates of 20–5000 mV s–1 is shown in Figure 4a,b. The total capacitance
of the devices was measured by calculating the total charge over the
voltage window of the electrolyte using 1  where Ct is the
total capacitance of the device, i is the current
density, and ΔV is the voltage window of the
electrolyte. Similarly, the areal capacitance Ca of the MSCs is calculated by normalizing Ct with the active electrode area (A) 2

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Surface Roughening Results
Figure 2a shows
the schematic
process steps to induce surface roughening on samples. SE chips are
illustrated in the green box, while the ArE chips are illustrated
in orange. Figure 2b shows the RA values of chips with different
roughening processes. A control SiO2 surface has the lowest RA = 0.28 nm. When a layer of Au/Ti is evaporated
over it, the roughness increases because of process-related parameters
for such metal evaporation. Among the SE chips, an evaporated Fe thin
film of 4 nm exhibits an RA = 1.61 nm.
When annealed at 600 °C for 9 min, the same film roughens to RA = 2.12 nm. There is an observed reduction
in RA for both films upon evaporation
of Au/Ti contacts of 100/20 nm, respectively. However, the annealed
Fe sample (Fea/Ti/Au) shows a 16% improvement in RA over the nonannealed sample (Fe/Ti/Au). The
ArE chips after Ar plasma treatment at 100 W for 3, 6, and 9 min,
respectively, showed a reduction in RA by 56% for the lowest time and decreases ever further when Ar plasma
is applied for higher times. Therefore, using plasma treatment for
improving the RA was discontinued. Figure 2d shows the atomic
force microscopy (AFM) micrographs of the fabricated MSC surfaces
after the lift-off process. The roughness of the control surface is
the lowest at 0.28 nm, followed by the control and contact surface.
The RA for the SE samples is much higher
than that for the control surfaces. Moreover, RA of the contacts over the annealed Fe is also higher than
the control + contact surface. Thus, the surface roughness of the
Fe nanoparticles is preserved even after evaporation of the current
collector. ArE chips, on the other hand, demonstrate that the use
of Ar plasma over the roughened surface of Fea/Ti/Au reduces RA by over 0.82 nm.

Figure 2c further illustrates the difference between
the surface roughening techniques. The annealing process transforms
the thin Fe film into nanoislands, while the Ar-plasma actions lead
to a smoothening effect on the substrate surface. The 4 nm Fe layer,
among the SE chips, demonstrated an RA value of 2.1 ± 0.2 nm. Because the 4 nm Fe film annealed at
600 °C for 9 min demonstrated the highest RA, this methodology was chosen for inducing roughening in the
MSC fabrication process in order to improve the thickness and uniformity
of the spin-coated GO electrodes. It is possible to achieve the same
surface roughness in the Fe nanoparticle layer if we use a 2 nm Fe
film at 500 °C for 5 min (AFM results in the Supporting Information). It is possible to scale down temperatures
and achieve the same surface roughness in the Fe nanoparticle layer
if we use a 2 nm Fe film annealed at 500 °C for 5 min (AFM results
in the Supporting Information), which would
move us further toward CMOS compatibility, for example, in Al-containing
processes.

One of the major issues with the control substrate
was in the nonuniformity
of deposition during spin-coating. The topmost substrate on the control
substrate is SiO2,48 which is
hydrophobic. When the solution is poured over the substrate and spin-coated,
the GO droplets would tend to coalesce into larger droplets with increased
surface tension. With the angular velocity of the spinner, these droplets
would move away from the completely hydrophobic surface. Therefore,
the spinner tries to get rid of as much as possible of the GO solution
which is composed of 90% DI water. The Fe-annealed nanofilm, on the
other hand, is hydrophilic.49 With such
a mixed composition of hydrophilic Fe surface and hydrophobic Au surface,50 the water composition of the spin-coated mixture
is attracted toward the hydrophilic surface, leaving the residue on
the hydrophobic Au surface. Adhesion of the spin-coated GO flakes
on the SE substrate leads to a larger surface coverage on the substrate
compared to that on the C substrate. The adhesive property of the
SE substrate was observed while spin-coating the GO. The improved
roughness led to a higher surface coverage in the first run of spin-coating.
This single layer deposition was uniform across the entire substrate,
that is, from the center to the edges. Thus, the deposition of a Fe
layer leads to greater retention of GO solution on the substrate during
the spin-coating process.

Figure 3a shows
the improvement of thicknesses on the SE substrate over the control
substrate. There is a 67% improvement in the thickness at the center,
with the SE electrode at 1.07 μm compared to 0.64 μm on
the control. At the edges, the retention on the SE substrates is more
prominent with a 78% increased electrode thickness on an average over
the control substrate, as can be seen in ±X ends.
The devices on the SE substrate exhibited an average height of 1.16
μm, while the devices on the control had a height of 0.71 μm.
The highest tel = 1.26 μm is measured
in the −X + Y quadrant on
the SE substrate, while the lowest tel = 0.98 μm was found to be at the left edge of the −X – Y quadrant.

Furthermore,
there is a 21% improvement in the mass of the retained
GO flakes on the SE substrate compared to that on the C substrate.
This has previously been demonstrated in research conducted by Vyas
et al.41 As noted previously, the roughness
induced by the annealing process leads to a higher coefficient of
friction. Thus, with the optimal frictional coefficient for a SE sample,
the GO flakes will tend to adhere to the wafer substrate.

The
uniformity of the spin-coated GO over the substrate surface
was analyzed by measuring several 1 mm windows over the substrate. Figure 3b shows the histogram
of the thickness of the spin-coated GO on the control and SE surface.
The graph shows that the uniformity of both the surfaces was interpreted
as Gaussian distributions. The standard deviation on the SE is much
lower than that of the control surface, that is, 37–87 nm.

3.2 Electrochemical Results
After fabrication,
the MSCs on the two substrates, control (C-MSCs) and SE (SE-MSCs),
were analyzed for their electrochemical performance with the EMIM-TFSI
electrolyte. There were 23 devices on each of the SE and C substrates.
Out of them, 20 devices on the SE substrate and only 8 devices on
the C substrate demonstrated capacitive behavior when they were tested
with EMIM-TFSI. The wafer yield of SE-MSCs is 87% compared to the
meagre 33% for the C-MSCs. There was a resistive behavior observed
on the remaining samples on both the substrates. All the devices with
variable fingers and spacings, namely, 1F-40, 5F-40, 10F-40, 20F-40,
and 20F-60, demonstrated similar behavior for SE- and C-MSC substrates,
respectively. The scope of the results is currently to demonstrate
the main differences in the performance of the C- and SE-MSCs.

Figure 4 shows a representative
image of only two of the several devices fabricated on a 2 in. Si
substrate. The analytical dependence of the number of fingers and
spacings has previously been studied by Li et al.46 They concluded that 20F-40 devices demonstrated the highest
rate capability among all designs. Rate capability was measured by
the ratio of high scan rate capacitance to low scan rate capacitance
or similarly high current density capacitance to low current density
capacitance. However, the performance of these devices on the edge
of the substrates had demonstrated a higher drop in capacitance in
comparison to other devices such as 1F-40 and 5F-40. This was in direct
contradiction with the performance recorded for the devices in the
center of the substrate. One of the main reasons for poor performance
of the devices fabricated near the substrate edge was ineffective
mass loading in the control substrate during spin-coating. As discussed
in Section 3, SE produces
a substantial improvement in the thickness of the electrodes, mass
loading of GO, and uniformity of the spin-coated GO when the SE method
is used.

Figure 4a,b shows
the cyclic voltammograms of two of the fabricated MSCs on substrates,
namely, 20F-40 and 20F-60, for both the C and SEdevices at 20 and
2000 mV s–1, respectively. Both the devices reveal
quasi-rectangular voltammograms that demonstrate a stronger influence
of the capacitive behavior over resistive behavior in the MSCs. The
charge retention capacity in both 20F-40 and 20F-60 is significantly
higher for SE-MSCs. This behavior is visible even more substantially
in Figure 4c, which
shows the areal capacitances of the two MSCs with 40 and 60 μm
spacing at different scan rates. The main reason for the improved
capacitive performance is the improved electrode thickness, as observed
in Figure 3a. SE-20F-40
shows the highest CA at 20 mV s–1 compared to C-20F-40 MSCs. The SE-20F-40 MSCs show a rate capability
of 59.7%, while the C-MSCs exhibit a rate capability of 56.2%. Similarly,
the energy density of the SE-MSC is 30.3 μJ cm–2, higher than C-MSCs, 12.1 μJ cm–2. At higher
scan rates, the energy density for SE-20F-60 is 19.4 μJ cm–2 at 5000 mV/s. In contrast, the C-MSC could demonstrate
an energy density of just 9.5 μJ cm–2. The
power density of the SE-MSCs for both 20F-40 and 20F-60 cases is better
than that of C-MSCs. The highest power density achieved in the 20F-40
device was 96.9 μW cm–2 at 5000 mV/s, 1.9
times higher than the power density achieved with C-MSCs of the same
configuration.

Volumetric capacitance, calculated from eq 3, provides a way of understanding
the device
when its performance is normalized by the volume of the electrode
material. Because A is constant for the respective
devices measured and Ct depends on the
total charge stored in the activated GO electrodes, the total stored
charge depends on the specific surface area (As) of the electrode. If As is the
same for both C- and SE-MSCs, equivalent CV values should be observed for the C- and SE-MSCs. Figure 4d displays the acquired volumetric
capacitance of MSCs on C and SEsubstrates. The error bars are calculated
by using the control deviation notations obtained from Figure 3b. In our current case, we
see that all the devices have a volumetric capacitance of 0.90 ±
0.2 F cm–3, which is in line with our stated assumption.

3.3 Discussion
The SE-MSCs have demonstrated
a better capacitive behavior, higher energy density, and power density
compared to the C-MSCs, as seen in Figures 4 and 5b. However,
they still suffer from several issues that might make them incompatible
with CMOS microelectronics at present. The EMIM-TFSI electrolyte is
an ionic liquid, which can be ideally suitable for CMOS integration
because of its high electrochemical window of 3 V. However, with both
the SE- and C-MSCs, the operating window of the electrolyte was restricted
to only slightly over 1 V. After 1 V, there was a clear indication
of a stronger resistive behavior in the MSCs. The resistive trend
was also observed at the cathodic interface while discharging. One
of the reasons for a poor voltage window can be attributed to the
splitting of water that is absorbed from the open environment during
the measurement.51 The issue of exposure
to air is a consequence of the convenience required for carrying out
multiple iterations of electrochemical characterization. This issue
can be mitigated by encapsulation of the device with the electrolyte
through glass or vacuum packaging. The CV measurements for SE-MSCs
show another bump on the voltammogram at 1.25–1.35 V. This
sudden increase in charge storage can be due to a reaction between
the Fe layer and EMIM-TFSI ions and air;52 adding such an active metal layer also results in a chemical reaction
because in an open environment, water or oxygen in the air can be
absorbed by the electrolyte solution and thence react with iron. Moreover,
higher voltage makes reactions more active. The reaction is also visible
during the discharging process.

A persistent issue with SE-MSCs
is that they have a slightly worse rate capability because of substantial
electrolyte resistance (Rct), in line
with Figures 4c and 5a. Rct consists of the
resistance of the electrolyte that depends on the geometric structure
and electrolyte solution and contact resistance from the current collectors.
The Rct for the SE-MSCs was measured by
investigating the intercept of the curves in Figure 5a on the Zreal-axis. For SE-MSC, the plot intersected the axis at 115 Ω,
while the C-MSC demonstrated a value of 67 Ω. According to Conway
et al.,53 the slope of the Warburg impedance
(IW) provides an insight into the resistance
observed at the pore interface of the electrode and electrolyte. An
inspection of the slopes of curves in Figure 5a shows that the SE-MSCs exhibit a higher
resistance at the pore interface of the electrode and electrolyte
compared to the C-MSCs. A poor conductance in the Fea/Ti/Au
current collectors due to higher surface roughness is likely to demonstrate
such a result. All the above conclusions can be achieved through calibration
of an equivalent circuit behavior shown in 5c. Table 1 shows the
acquired values.

Table 1 List of Values of Parameters for SE-
and C-MSCs Calculated from the Equivalent Circuit Model Shown in Figure 5c
circuit element	SE-MSC	C-MSC	units	
Rct	134.6	67.45	Ω	
Yo	5.6 μ	4.5 μ	S s	
porosity	0.75	0.80	 	
Finally, after comparing
the capacitance for SE- and C-MSCs over
a range of input voltage frequencies in Figure 5b, it can be seen that the SE-MSCs show a
stronger capacitive behavior until 524 Hz, while with C-MSCs, it is
until 3.24 kHz. This is investigated by observing the frequency at
which the SE and C curves start deviating from the straight line at
lower frequencies. It is referred to as the knee-point. The knee-point
marks the maximum frequency below which the supercapacitor shows a
predominantly capacitive behavior.54 Therefore,
a high knee-point is generally preferred for MSCs. Furthermore, the
SE-MSCs have poor capacitive performance at frequencies higher than
its knee-point. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher surface
roughness of the SE-MSCs.55 Increased roughness
leads to a higher leakage current in capacitors.56 This is the only trade-off for improving capacitance through
surface roughening that cannot be addressed by performing further
surface engineering.

In comparison to the devices produced in
previous years,57 the rGO-based MSCs fabricated
through spin-coating
do not perform as well as CVD-based devices. In some cases, the MSCs
fabricated through the spin-coating technique in this paper demonstrate
a power density of 96 μW cm–2, significantly
higher than the power densities of MSCs fabricated through ink-jet
printing,11,58−60 layer-by-layer method,61 and electrophoretic deposition62,63 of carbon-based electrodes. However, in several other cases, their
performance is lower by 1 order of magnitude.16 Rather than addressing the performance metrics of individual devices,
the main purpose of using our approach of promoting surface roughness
enhancement through annealed nanoparticles is to provide general means
to improve the uniformity, adhesion, and coverage of the deposited
solution, particularly by spin-coating. The approach can also be appropriated
with spray-coating, ink-jet printing, and layer-by-layer deposition
facilities or any technique which is at risk to suffer from poor surface
adhesion of the electrode during lithography steps. We can improve
the capacitive performance by increasing the number of spin-coated
layers and viscosity of the solution, while utilizing the effects
of the metal nanoparticle layer that would improve the wafer yield.
The initial results for these tests can be found in the Supporting Information. Moreover, we can make
channels for electrolytes as demonstrated by Li et al.8 for packaged MSC devices for further integration with energy
harvesters or sensors. Finally, as the fabrication process is CMOS-compatible,
these devices can be easily integrated with either micro-energy harvesters
or even the IC power management unit in a front-end-of-line of back-end-of-line
configuration and can be utilized to charge temperature, pressure,
or humidity sensors.57

4 Conclusions
MSCs fabricated through CMOS-compatible techniques
such as spin-coating
hold an enormous potential for realizing an integrated on-chip self-power
unit for wireless sensors in the applications for Internet-of-things.
In this paper, we have demonstrated that a substrate with an increased
surface roughness due to a 4 nm annealed Fe layer enhances the performance
of the MSCs fabricated through spin-coated GO electrode deposition.
The electrode layers deposited on C and SE substrates demonstrate
that the latter has a 78% increased thickness and a 21% improved mass
retention. It also shows a 57% uniformity improvement of the electrode
material coverage over a 2″ Si substrate. These improvements
have led to gains in the performance of rGO-based MSCs in terms of
areal capacitance, rate capability, energy density, and power density.
Furthermore, a wafer yield of 87% was observed in the SE-MSC fabrication
compared to only 33% in the C-MSCs. Most importantly, the devices
positioned at the edge of the SE substrate demonstrated a near equivalent
behavior to the devices at the center, thereby demonstrating an improved
control on the performance of the devices fabricated on a single substrate.
Although the SE-MSCs showed a higher RE than the C-MSCs, perhaps due to the reactive nature of Fe with the
electrolyte, the use of inert layers such as Ti, Pt, or Pd for nanoparticle
formation can mitigate this challenge. Thus, utilization of surface
enhancement techniques such as surface roughening can potentially
enhance the performance of spin-coated MSCs, thereby making them a
truly viable option for further on-chip integration with energy harvesters
and electronics of wireless sensors, making them self-powered and
with an extended or even infinite lifetime.
