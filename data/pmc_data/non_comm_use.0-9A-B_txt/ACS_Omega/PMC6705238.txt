Co3O4 nanostructures have been extensively
studied as anode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries
(LIBs) because of their stability and high energy density. However,
several drawbacks including low electrical transport and severe volume
changes over a long period of operation have limited their utilities
in LIBs. Rational composite design is becoming an attractive strategy
to improve the performance and stability of potential lithium-ion-battery
anode materials. Here, a simple method for synthesizing hollow Co3O4@TiO2 nanostructures using metal–organic
frameworks as sacrificial templates is reported. Being used as an
anode material for LIBs, the resulting composite exhibits remarkable
cycling performance (1057 mAh g–1 at 100 mA g–1 after 100 cycles) and good rate performance. The
optimized amorphous Co3O4@TiO2 hollow
dodecahedron shows a significant improvement in electrochemical performance
and shows a wide prospect as an advanced anode material for LIBs in
the future.

Introduction
In recent years, lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) have been widely
used in smartphones, notebook computers, and hybrid electric vehicles.1−3 However, the theoretical capacity of graphite is relatively low,
about 372 mAh g–1, which is insufficient to meet
the growing requirement for next-generation batteries featuring high
energy density and prolonged lifespan.4−7 Since the performance of LIBs largely depends
on electrode materials, innovations in new electrode materials have
attracted considerable attention.8−10 Notably, lots of research
work have been made to explore suitable anode materials with high
power capacity, long cycle life, and safety.11,12

Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) are a class of promising candidates
that are used as anode materials on account of their extensive availability,
high theoretical capacity, low cost, and ease of mass production.13−15 Nanostructured TMOs are of great importance to experimentally realizing
high-performance and cost-effective anode materials, for example,
nanorods,16 nanofibers,17 nanoplatelets,18 and nanoflowers19 have been reported. The dynamic structure can not only adapt
to the volume change during the cycle but also shorten the Li+ transportation path and improve the storage performance.20

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline
inorganic
and organic hybrid materials featuring well-defined framework-like
structures and high surface areas. The highly ordered structures of
MOFs can also function as promising sacrificial templates for synthesizing
porous materials.21,22 A series of transition-metal
oxides derived from MOFs have been utilized in high-performance lithium-ion
batteries, such as Co3O4,2323 CuO,24 CuO/Cu2O,25 NiO,18 NiCo2O4/NiO,26 NiFe2O4, ZnFe2O4, and CoFe2O4,27 and Fe3O4/VOx.28 Among these MOF-derived TMOs,
CO3O4 has attracted much attention due to its
good theoretical capacity (890 mAh g–1) and excellent
electrical conductivity. Dan et al.20 have reported porous
Co3O4 hollow tetrahedra. [Co3L2(TPT)2·xG]n was selected as a precursor for the preparation of hollow
Co3O4, heated at 500 °C for 4 h in air,
and cooled to room temperature to get Co3O4 powder.
Wang et al.29 have proposed the reversible
capacity of Co3O4/TiO2 hollow composites
at 500 mA g–1 after 200 cycles to be 642 mA h g–1, maintaining 96.9% of the initial capacity. Unfortunately,
their cycling performance was severely affected during lithiation/delithiation
processes.

Herein, we report a novel strategy for the preparation
of hollow
Co3O4@TiO2 composites with dodecahedron
structures via thermal decomposition of ZIF-67 and TiO2 coating. Moreover, their unique porous Co3O4@TiO2 hollow amorphous structure not only provides fast
ion-conducting channels but also has sufficient buffer space for volumetric
expansion during the cycling process. Since the capacity of Co3O4 is high, the battery capacity usually declines
quickly because of large volume change during the charging/recharging
cycle. Furthermore, TiO2 has a very low capacity but a
high stability, long cycle life, low cost, and environmentally benign
character.22,30−33 When the anode materials of the
LIBs are evaluated at the same time, their strengths and weaknesses
are complementary; there is also a gradation of the porous structure,
making the anode have increased specific capacity, rate capability,
and cycling stability.

Material Characterization
Field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, ZEISS MERLIN,
Germany) with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS), TEM, and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM-2100) were used
to observe the morphologies, elements, and structures of ZIF-67, Co3O4 and Co3O4@TiO2. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were detected on Bruker
D8 equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Ǻ).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a PerkinElmer
thermogravimetric analyzer under an air atmosphere from room temperature
to 800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min–1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was analyzed on an AXIS165
photoelectron spectrometer using an AlK scalar X-ray source. N2 adsorption/desorption measurements (BET, NOVA1000e) were
performed to understand the pore properties of samples.

Electrochemical
Measurements
The electrochemical behavior of the Co3O4@TiO2 hollow structure was investigated by
using CR 2016
coin cells with pure lithium foil as the counter electrode, Celgard
2400 as the separator, 1 M LiPF6 was dissolved in ethylene
carbonate/propylene carbonate (1:1, w/w) as the electrolyte. The active
materials prepared (70 wt %), carbon black (20 wt %), and binder poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (10 wt %) were mix with in NMP to form a homogeneous slurry,
which was coated on a copper sheet and finally dried in a vacuum oven
for 24 h. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried
out on a LAND CT2001A battery-test system under different current
densities within the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. The cyclic
voltammogram (CV) was performed on a CHI660C Electrochemical Workstation
at a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in a potential range
of 0.01–3.0 V vs Li/Li+. Electrochemical impedance
spectra (EIS) was tested on the CHI660E within a frequency range of
100 kHz to 10 mHz.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis
process of the Co3O4@TiO2 amorphous
structure is displayed in Scheme 1. The Co3O4 hollow
structure was synthesized for the first time via ZIF-67 as a precursor
(heated to 450 °C at a speed of 2 °C min–1 in the air). Whereafter, by means of chemical deposition, a layer
of amorphous TiO2 was fully coated over the Co3O4 to form amorphous Co3O4@TiO2, which was then subjected to annealing heat treatment at
400 °C at a speed of 2 °C min–1 in an
argon atmosphere and kept for 5 h, which was converted into an amorphous
hollow dodecahedron structure.

Used to Fabricate Amorphous
Co3O4@TiO2 Composite Hollow Dodecahedrons
The crystalline structure and phase composition
of the as-synthesized
sample ZIF-67 were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
measurement, as shown in Figure 1a. All of the diffraction peaks of the prepared precursor
ZIF-67 are consistent with previous reports.34 The microstructure of the as-synthesized ZIF-67 was investigated
by FESEM, and the representative image is shown in Figure 1b,c. The morphology of the
sample is a dodecahedron microcrystal with a smooth surface and sharp
edges, with a diameter of 0.8–1 μm. The simulation model
image is displayed in the illustration (Figure 1c). The N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm of ZIF-67 is shown in Figure S1, Supporting Information, which gives the specific surface area (1005
m2 g–1). The TGA curve of the synthesized
ZIF-67 precursor is shown in Figure 1d. The mass loss starts at about 320 °C, and there
is no significant mass loss after 440 °C. The total mass loss
is approximately 62%, affording a dark Co3O4 powder. Therefore, by setting the calcination temperature to 450
°C, we can obtain smaller and stable crystals.

simulated XRD patterns of ZIF-67. (b) Low-
and (c) high-magnification FESEM images of ZIF-67. (d) TGA curves
of ZIF-67 under an air atmosphere.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Co3O4 obtained by pyrolyzing ZIF-67 and the Co3O4 prepared by the solvothermal method were collected on a powder X-ray
diffractometer (Rigaku, SmartLab) with the u–2u scan mode from
25 to 70°, as shown in Figure 2a. Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons were
determined to be cubic cobalt oxide, as evidenced by the characteristic
diffraction peaks, which are in good agreement with a cubic spinel
Co3O4 (JCPDS card no. 42-1467).35 However, the characteristic diffraction peak of as-prepared
Co3O4 is consistent with the standard card but
the crystallinity is not ideal. The PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized
Co3O4@TiO2 is presented in Figure 2b, showing the diffraction
peaks of Co3O4 and TiO2 (JCPDS card
no. 21-1272). However, after coating with TiO2 and annealing
again, the diffraction peaks of Co3O4@TiO2 are similar to Co3O4, indicating that
the coating process of TiO2 did not affect the crystal
structure. However, we could not obtain the characteristic XRD pattern
attributed to TiO2 presumably due to its low content amorphous
form.36 To further characterize the structure
of Co3O4@TiO2, energy mapping was
performed and the data are shown (Figure S2a). These results confirmed the presence of Co, O, and Ti, suggesting
that we have obtained a composite material. EDS spectra illustrate
that the atomic ratio of Co/Ti/O in the Co3O4@TiO2 nanocomposite is 0.37:0.04:0.59, as shown in Figure S2b. The XPS spectra are shown in Figure 3a–c. The characteristic
peaks of Co, Ti, and O chemical elements are detected, confirming
that only these three elements are present in the composite. The two
peak values of 780.6 (Co 2p3/2) and 796.3 eV (Co 2p1/2) are obvious, in accordance with Co2+ species.
In the XPS spectrum of Ti 2p, it can be observed that the peak values
of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 are 463.7 eV and 457.9,
which proves the existence of Ti4+. To know the ratio of
Co and Ti metal ions more accurately, we have carried out the ICP-MS
test with Co3O4@TiO2 (Table 1). Prior to ICP-MS measurements,
Co3O4@TiO2 was washed and centrifuged
with 30 mL of deionized water, then with 30 mL of EtOH, and then dried
under vacuum for 12 h. Co3O4@TiO2 with a weight of 0.1 mg was prepared and dissolved in 37.5% hydrochloric
acid at room temperature. The sample was then diluted to 10×
in hydrochloric acid (2.5 mL) and deionized water. A PerkinElmer Optima
8000 ICP-MS was used for further analysis. The resulting calibration
curves have a minimum R2 of 0.999. The
individual results of the samples were averaged to determine the metal
ratios. ICP-MS measurements of Co3O4@TiO2 with the Co/Ti metal ratios of 6:1.

In addition, the morphology was completely maintained
after calcination:
the obtained Co3O4 had a rhombic dodecahedral
shape (Figure 4a).
Compared to the precursor, the Co3O4 rhombic
dodecahedral structure shrinks by 10% in size and its structural diameter
is about 800 nm. The microstructure of Co3O4@TiO2 is further examined by TEM analysis. Figure 4b,c reveals that there is a
distinct electron distribution difference between the melanocratic
edge and light-colored center, confirming the amorphous structure
of the nanocomposites. The HRTEM image of Co3O4@TiO2 shows that the thickness of the TiO2 coating
is about 15 nm. To demonstrate the high structural stability of the
Co3O4@TiO2 material (Figure S3), we also tested the FESEM of the material
after 10 cycles at a current density of 0.1C. Found after several
lithiation processes and after the delithiation process, the material
still retains the original frame structure. It is proved that the
structure of Co3O4@TiO2 is stable.

of amorphous Co3O4@TiO2.

To gain further insight into the porous hollow rhombic dodecahedral
Co3O4 and Co3O4@TiO2, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was
used to quantify the specific surface area and pore size distribution.
As shown in Figure S4a,b, Co3O4@TiO2 shows a typical IV curve with a hysteresis
loop, indicating its mesoporous character. Co3O4@TiO2 exhibits a broad pore size distribution, and the
first-rate BET specific surface area was 65.350 m2 g–1. Correspondingly, the specific surface area of Co3O4 is 44.369 m2 g–1, less than that of Co3O4@TiO2.
In addition, the average pore size of Co3O4@TiO2 (28.197 nm) is larger than that of Co3O4 (15.312 nm), which is beneficial for enhancing the transport of
Li+ across such a matrix and adjusting the volume change
in the discharge/charge process.

The uniqueness of the aforementioned
mesoporous Co3O4@TiO2 composite is
that it not only provides electron
and ion-conducting channels but also enables sufficient buffer space
for volumetric expansion of the material during the charge/discharge
cycling process.26

Electrochemical Performance
To evaluate the potential application of the Co3O4@TiO2 composite material as a novel energy storage
material for the anode electrode of LIBs, cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed. Figure 5a shows the Co3O4@TiO2 electrode between the voltage
range of 0.001 and 3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 for the first three cycles. The electrochemical reactions of Co3O4 and TiO2 with lithium are described
as follows 1   2  In the first cathodic scan, it is
possible
that the peak near 0.55 V corresponds to the reduction of Co2+ to metallic Co, and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface
(SEI) layer and amorphous Li2O. In the subsequent anodic
scan, a wide peak located at 2.15 V vs Li/Li+ can be attributed
to the reoxidization of metallic cobalt to Co2+ and the
decomposition of Li2O. The characteristic cathodic peaks
at 1.35 and 1.42 V and the anodic peak at 2.1 V are due to the insertion/extraction
of lithium ions (reaction 2). The wide anodic peak at 2.1 V and the cathodic peak at 0.9 V are
related to the reversible oxidation/reduction of Co/Co3O4 (reaction 1). However, after the second cycle, the CV curves remain nearly identical
during cycling, indicating that Co3O4@TiO2 exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate retention.

curves at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in
the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. (b) Charge/discharge profiles
at a current density of 0.1 A g–1. (c) Cycling performance
at a current density of 0.1 A g–1. (d) Rate capabilities
of Co3O4, hollow Co3O4, and Co3O4@TiO2.

Representative charge–discharge voltage profiles for
the
1st, 5th, and 10th cycles of the Co3O4@TiO2 electrode at a current density of 100 mA g–1 (about 0.1C) are shown in Figure 5b. In the first cycle, there is a discharge voltage
plateau at about 1 V due to the heterogeneous reaction mechanism between
metallic Li and the electrode. The initial discharge and charge capacities
are 1430.7 and 1102.0 mAh g–1, respectively. In
the initial cycle, the irreversible capacity loss is caused by electrolyte
decomposition and the formation of a SEI film, with a capacity loss
of approximately 23%.37 The 5th and 10th
discharge capacities of the Co3O4@TiO2 electrode are 1312.39 and 1326.792 mAh g–1, respectively.
The discharge/charge profiles of 5th and 10th almost overlap with
each other, indicating that the electrochemical performance of the
anode is stable.

Figure 5c shows
the cycling stability of the Co3O4@TiO2 electrode, hollow Co3O4, and as-prepared Co3O4 at a current density of 100 mA g–1. The initial discharge capacity of the LIB of Co3O4@TiO2 is 1430 mAh g–1, which
is 35% higher than the LIB based on solely Co3O4. At the same time, the amorphous type Co3O4@TiO2 composite electrode exhibited good cycling stability.
After cycling 100 times at 100 mA g–1, the capacity
was approximately 1057 mAh g–1, accompanied by an
average Coulombic efficiency of over 101%. Note that the average Coulombic
efficiency of hollow Co3O4 and as-prepared Co3O4 is also above 99%, indicating that the conversion
reaction between Li and Co3O4 is highly reversible.
On the contrary, the capacity of the Co3O4 anode
dropped to 708 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles and continued
to decrease to 32%. The two electrode discharge capacities gradually
increased around the first 10 cycles, which further confirmed the
presence of electrode activation. For TMO electrode materials, the
increased capacity in the early cycling can be explained by the following
factors: (1) the polymer layer due to electrolyte degradation contributes
some extra capacity through “pseudocapacitative behavior”;38 (2) the diffusion kinetics of Li+ ions can be improved;39,40 and (3) lithium interface
storage also provides some capacity.41 For
as-prepared Co3O4, from the 1st cycle to the
13th cycle, the capacity dropped rapidly and then slowed down to about
53 cycles and the capacity dropped to 372 mAh g–1, which is the same as that of graphite. This indicates that the
volume of the common Co3O4 material changes
significantly in the charging/discharging process, and the capacity
retention rate is too low. Amorphous type Co3O4@TiO2 nanostructures have larger capacities than pristine
hollow Co3O4 and common Co3O4, and the reversible capacity of amorphous type Co3O4@TiO2 nanostructures is much higher than
those of most previous reports on MOF-derived Co3O4 samples. Our sample was compared with the previously published
Co3O4 anode material extracted from MOFs for
lithium-ion batteries in terms of morphology and cycling performance
(Table 2). In addition, Figure 5d shows the cycling
stability of the as-prepared Co3O4 electrode,
the Co3O4 electrode and the Co3O4@TiO2 electrode at the current density range of
0.1–4 A g–1. With the current density being
increased gradually from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.4, 1, and 2 A g–1, the specific capacity of Co3O4@TiO2 decreased from 1291 to 1083, 1030, 736, and 300 mAh g–1. However, the capacity of hollow Co3O4 is
reduced from 733 to 619, 416, 236, and 118 mAh g–1, and the capacity of common Co3O4 degrades
from 452 to 335, 177, 79, and 44 mA g–1. The reversible
capacity of Co3O4@TiO2 remains at
60 mAh g–1 at a high current density of 4 A g–1, which is 46% greater than that of hollow Co3O4 and 87% better than that of as-prepared Co3O4. More importantly, after a high-rate discharge–charge
cycle, the electrode capacity could be restored despite the decrease
in current density. When the current density charged to 100 mA g–1, its discharge capacity restored to 1 Ah g–1, and the Co3O4 capacity restored to 500 mAh
g–1. However, the as-prepared Co3O4 capacity was only restored to 242 mAh g–1. The high reversible capacity, good cycling performance, and rate
capability of the Co3O4@TiO2 electrode
can be ascribed to the following reasons: the hollow porous structure
of Co3O4@TiO2 can furnish enough
space to adapt the volume changes and to reduce crushing. Meanwhile,
the repetition of the lithiation/delithiation process provides more
electroactive sites within the pores for rapid electrochemical reactions
and facilitates the delivery of lithium ions at the electrolyte/electrode
interface, leading to a significant improvement in performance.

We then employed electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to
further study the lithium storage performance of LIBs containing Co3O4@TiO2, hollow Co3O4, and Co3O4. The EIS spectra were compared
at ambient temperature in the frequency domain of 100k to 0.01 Hz.
In the Nyquist diagram, R (Ω) represents the
cell’s Ohmic resistors and the electrode/electrolyte interface
(Rct) represents the charge transfer resistor.
All of the electrodes of the Nyquist plot including a depression of
the semicircle show a subsequent slash in the low-frequency range
and in the mid-frequency range, which is attributed to the charge
transfer impedance at the electrode/electrolyte interface (Rct) and the electrolyte resistance (Rs).42 According to
the EIS analysis (Figure 6), the as-prepared Co3O4 had the largest
semicircle diameter and its charge transfer resistance was about 300
Ω. The Co3O4@TiO2 amorphous
composite material has a smaller semicircle diameter than hollow Co3O4, and its charge transfer resistance was about
210 Ω. After the combination of TiO2, the charge
transfer resistance decreased to 100 Ω, suggesting that the
Co3O4@TiO2 electrode is indeed a
promising anode, featuring desirable material properties including
lower contact and charge transfer impedance.

Conclusions
In summary, a new templated synthesis of high-performance hybrid
materials for LIBs is proposed. Amorphous hollow dodecahedron nanostructures
composed of TiO2-encapsulated Co3O4 are synthesized by utilizing ZIF-67 polyhedrons as sacrificial templates
by pyrolysis in air to afford Co3O4 with a coating
of TiO2 in the outer layer. It is then annealed in an Ar
atmosphere to form an amorphous Co3O4@TiO2 composite exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance,
good rate performance, and excellent cycling stability. In addition,
MOF-templated synthesis of metal oxides is an effective technology
for the preparation of porous nanomaterials with a well-designed structure
and is expected to be used for the production of high-performance
anode materials for advanced LIBs.

was stirred in air for about 10 min to form a uniform slurry. Then,
the mixture was transferred to an autoclave, sealed, and kept at 150
°C for 3 h. After that, the autoclave is cooled down naturally
to room temperature. Then, the product was washed with water three
times and put into a vacuum drying oven at 60 °C for 4 h.

added to it. The dispersion was stirred at 25 °C for 3 h. The
resulting dark particles were harvested by centrifugation and washed
several times with deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and
then dried overnight at 70 °C. This dried sample was heated to
400 °C in a quartz tube furnace at a speed of 2 °C min–1 in an argon atmosphere and kept for 5 h. Finally,
