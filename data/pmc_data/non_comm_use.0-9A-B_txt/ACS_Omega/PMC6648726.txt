Nickel hydroxide has attracted much
attention as an anode material
for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high specific capacity,
low cost, and easy preparation. However, the poor cycling stability
greatly hampers its application. Herein, Fe-doped nickel hydroxide
powders with a high tap density (2.16 g cm–3) are
synthesized by a simple chemical co-precipitation method. Compared
to undoped nickel hydroxide, this Fe-doped nickel hydroxide exhibits
better lithium storage activity, enhanced cycling stability and rate
capability, and improved electrochemical reaction kinetics. As an
anode material for LIBs, the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide delivers a
specific discharge capacity of 1080 mA h g–1 at
200 mA g–1 after 30 cycles, which is almost twice
that (519 mA h g–1) of undoped nickel hydroxide;
at a high current density of 2000 mA g–1, Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide shows a specific capacity of 661 mA h g–1, significantly higher than that (182 mA h g–1)
of undoped nickel hydroxide. Kinetic analysis reveals that Fe doping
decreases the electrochemical reaction resistance and improves the
lithium ion diffusivity in a nickel hydroxide electrode.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Development of lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) with high energy density,
high rate capability, good safety, and long cycle life is urgently
needed for future portable electronics, electric vehicles, and energy
storage stations.1,2 To meet the ever-increasing demand
of next-generation LIBs, it is very crucial to explore high-performance
electrode active materials.3,4 The conventional carbon-based
anode materials suffer from low theoretical capacity (∼372
mA h g–1) and safety issues due to the problem of
lithium deposition. In recent years, transition-metal oxides (such
as Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiO,
and ZnO) as anode materials for LIBs have attracted great attention
because of their large theoretical capacity, low cost, environmental
friendliness, good safety, and high natural abundance.3,5,6 Other than these transition-metal
oxides, some transition-metal hydroxides, such as Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2, are also reported as novel anode materials
for LIBs.7,8 Compared with transition-metal oxides, transition-metal
hydroxides have the advantages of low preparation cost (without the
need of high-temperature sintering during synthesis process); in particular,
the −OH groups in transition-metal hydroxides can easily react
with Li+ to form LiOH; the as-formed LiOH could further
react reversibly with Li+ at low voltage reversibly to
generate Li2O and LiH, which can contribute additional
lithium storage capacity.9−11 Thus, transition-metal hydroxides
are considered as promising anode materials with higher energy density
for next-generation LIBs.5,12 However, as conversation-type
electrode materials, transition-metal hydroxides also suffer from
poor cycling stability due to the huge volume change during lithiation/delithiation
cycles; moreover, their rate capability is also unsatisfactory because
of their low electronic conductivity.13 To enhance the lithium storage performance of hydroxides, most of
the previous studies focus on fabricating nanostructured materials
and/or by composing with conductive carbon materials.10,14−18 Indeed, metal cations doping in electrode materials can introduce
local crystal defects and modulate the electronic structure, which
are crucial parameters for determining the lithium storage performance.19−22 So far, there are few reports of the effect of metal cations doping
on the lithium storage performance of hydroxides used as an anode
material for LIBs.

In the present work, high-tap-density Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide
has been synthesized via a simple chemical co-precipitation method.
The effect of Fe doping on the microstructure and lithium storage
performance was studied. It revealed that the Fe doping can effectively
improve the lithium storage properties of nickel hydroxide, including
higher specific capacity, enhanced Li+ diffusivity, better
rate capability, and lower electrochemical reaction resistance, as
compared to the undoped counterpart.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a gives
the XRD patterns of the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and pure nickel
hydroxide samples. For comparison, the standard XRD patterns of β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 14-117) and α-Ni(OH)2·0.75H2O (JCPDS 38-715) are also shown at the bottom of Figure 1a. All the diffraction
peaks of pure nickel hydroxide can be indexed to the standard spectrum
of β-Ni(OH)2 (JCPDS 14-117), suggesting the sample
has a β-phase structure. The interlayer distance of this pure
nickel hydroxide is calculated to be 4.62 Å. In contrast, the
Fe-doped nickel hydroxide sample shows additional diffraction peaks
from α-phase nickel hydroxide (JCPDS 38-715), revealing it has
mixed α-/β-phase structures. The interlayer distance of
the α-motifs in the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide sample is calculated
to be 7.84 Å, much larger than that (4.56 Å) of the β-motifs.
The larger interlayer space of α-motifs in the Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide sample could facilitate the fast diffusion of the lithium
ion and alleviate the volume changes of an electroactive material
during lithiation/delithiation cycles, which are very important for
improving the rate performance and cycling stability of an electrode. Figure 1b gives the TGA plots
of the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and pure nickel hydroxide samples.
There appear three weight loss regions for both samples. The initial
weight loss in a range of 25–200 °C is assigned to the
elimination of adsorbed and intercalated water molecules;23 the weight loss values in this interval for
Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and pure nickel hydroxide are 7.2 and 3.7%,
respectively; the larger weight loss for Fe-doped nickel hydroxide
can be ascribed to the existence of structural water in the α-motifs.
These structural water molecules in the α-motifs could act as
pillars to maintain the larger interlayer distance and on the other
hand, contribute to shielding Li+ from the lattice host,24 which is favorable to the fast diffusion of
Li+ in the electrode and accordingly enhances the rate
capability. The second weight loss in the range of 200–310
°C is caused by the decomposition of nickel hydroxide to nickel
oxide;25 the weight loss values in this
interval for pure nickel hydroxide and Fe-doped nickel hydroxide are
16.3 and 16.2%, respectively. The third weight loss in the range of
310–450 °C results from the decomposition of adsorbed
and/or intercalated anions (such as NO3– and CO32–).26 For the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide sample, the molar ratio of [Fe/Ni]
coming from the EDS result is 15.8%, which is in accordance with the
initial molar ratio of [Fe3+/Ni2+] in the reaction
solution.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns and (b) TGA plots of the as-prepared pure nickel
hydroxide and Fe-doped nickel hydroxide samples.

Figure 2 presents
the SEM images of the pure nickel hydroxide and Fe-doped nickel hydroxide
samples. Both samples show irregular-shaped microparticles (Figure 2a,d) with a rough
surface (Figure 2b,e).
By a detailed observation, one can find that microparticles are actually
composed of the conglomeration of nanoplates (Figure 2c,f). By comparison, Fe-doped nickel hydroxide
has a much denser microstructure than pure nickel hydroxide. The tap
density of Fe-doped nickel hydroxide is measured to be approximately
2.16 g cm–3, much higher than that (1.25 g cm–3) of pure nickel hydroxide, meaning that Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide could provide higher volumetric energy density. Because
the Ksp value of Fe(OH)3 (2.8
× 10–39) is far lower than that of Ni(OH)2 (5.5 × 10–16), the deposition of Fe3+ in the nickel hydroxide lattice will be more rapid than
Ni2+; thus, these initially formed Fe(OH)3 colloidal
particles would provide a net structure and help the agglomeration
of colloidal nickel hydroxide particles. On the basis of this agglomeration,
the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide nanoparticles are prone to grow and
crystallize during the co-precipitation reaction process, which leads
to a much denser structure and higher tap density.

Figure 2 SEM images of the as-prepared
(a–c) pure nickel hydroxide
and (d–f) Fe-doped nickel hydroxide samples.

Figure 3a shows
the adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-prepared Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide and pure nickel hydroxide samples, which exhibit
a mesoporous material type IV curve with an obvious hysteresis loop.27 The Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and pure nickel
hydroxide samples show high BET surface areas of 98.8 and 98.0 m2 g–1, respectively. Figure 3b shows the pore size distributions calculated
from adsorption data using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) model. For the pure nickel hydroxide sample, the pore size distribution
mainly centers at ∼2.8 nm; in addition, there is a very wide
pore size distribution between 5 and 100 nm. For Fe-doped nickel hydroxide,
the pore size distribution mainly centers at ∼2.3 nm; in addition,
there is an obvious pore size distribution between 5 and 30 nm. The
high BET surface area and mesoporous structure of the Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide nanostructures offer the possibility of efficient transport
of electrons and ions in the electrode, which are expected to enhance
lithium storage performance. The BJH pore volumes for Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide and pure nickel hydroxide are 0.35 and 0.62 cm3 g–1, respectively. These results are consistent
with the SEM images (Figure 2) and tap density measurement results.

isotherms and (b) the corresponding
BJH pore size distribution curve for the pure nickel hydroxide and

Figure 4a
provides
the first cycle CV curves of the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and pure
nickel hydroxide electrodes measured at the scan rate of 0.08 mV s–1 in a potential range from 0.02 to 3.0 V. For the
initial cathodic process, both electrodes show two obvious reduction
peaks at the potential from 1.3 to 0.3 V, which can be due to the
initial reduction of nickel hydroxide to metallic Ni (and Fe for the
Fe-doped sample), the generation of LiOH and a solid electrolyte interface
(SEI) film, and the further reduction of H in the electrochemical
active materials.10,14 At the initial anodic process,
the complex oxidation peaks at 0.9–1.9 V can be ascribed to
the partial decomposition of the SEI film and the oxidation of LiH
to LiOH; the broad oxidation peak at ∼2.24 V can be attributed
to the oxidation of metallic Ni and the formation of Ni(OH)2.28 In the fourth CV curves (Figure 4b), there appears
only one obvious reduction peak, and its intensity decreases greatly
as compared with the first cycle CV curve, which can be attributed
to the structural rearrangement of an electrode active material and
the formation of the SEI film in the initial cathodic process. Compared
with the pure nickel hydroxide electrode, the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide
electrode shows larger redox peak areas, implying it has a better
reversible lithium storage activity.

Figure 4 (a) First and (b) fourth CV curves at
a scan rate of 0.08 mV s–1 for the pure nickel hydroxide
and Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide samples.

Figure 5a compares
the cycling performances of the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode
and pure nickel hydroxide electrode at a current density of 200 mA
g–1. Clearly, the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode
exhibits higher specific discharge capacity and better cycling stability
than the pure nickel hydroxide electrode. After 30 cycles, the Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide electrode delivers a specific discharge capacity
of 1080 mA h g–1, which is two times as high as
that (519 mA h g–1) of pure nickel hydroxide. Figure 5b,c shows the discharge/charge
plots at various cycles for the pure nickel hydroxide electrode and
Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode, respectively. In the first discharge
process, both electrodes show two long plateaus for the multistep
electrochemical reaction processes; in the first charge process, both
electrodes display two sloping plateaus at the potential ranges of
1.25–1.75 and 2.0–2.5 V, corresponding to the reversible
electrochemical delithiation reactions. The first cycle discharge/charge
capacities for the pure nickel hydroxide electrode and Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide electrode are 1702/1116 and 2446/1510 mA h g–1, respectively. The corresponding Coulombic efficiencies are 66 and
62%. The huge irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle is mainly
due to the formation of the SEI layer on the surface of an electrode
active material.29 In the subsequent discharge/charge
cycles, the discharge curves show one sloping potential plateau (1.25–0.75
V), and the capacities decrease gradually. The change of the discharge/charge
curves is in accordance with the CV results (Figure 4). The Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode
also shows better rate capability than the pure nickel hydroxide electrode
(Figure 5d). At a current
density of 100 mA g–1, the stable discharge capacities
of the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode and pure nickel hydroxide
electrode are 1435 and 1309 mA h g–1, respectively.
As the current density increases, the difference of specific discharge
capacity between the two electrodes becomes more and more obvious.
Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g–1, the
specific discharge capacity of Fe-doped nickel hydroxide still maintains
at 661 mA h g–1, which is far higher than that (182
mA h g–1) of the pure nickel hydroxide electrode.

Figure 6a gives
the Nyquist plots of the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode and pure
nickel hydroxide electrode in their fully charged state. Prior to
the EIS measurement, the cells were activated by five discharge/charge
cycles at a current density of 200 mA g–1. Both
Nyquist plots consist of one depressed semicircle at high frequencies
and an inclined line at the low frequencies, which are assigned to
the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) on
the active material/electrolyte interface and lithium ion diffusion
impedance in the active material (Warburg impedance).30 The Nyquist plots were fitted with the equivalent circuit
(the inset of Figure 6a) in which the symbols Re, CPE, Rct, and W are the electrolyte
resistance, constant phase element, charge-transfer resistance, and
Warburg impedance, respectively. The fitted Rct values of pure nickel hydroxide and Fe-doped nickel hydroxide
are 165.1 and 108.9 Ω, respectively. The above result means
that the electrochemical reaction at the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide/electrolyte
interface occurs more easily than that at the pure nickel hydroxide/electrolyte
interface, which account for the enhanced rate capability of Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide (Figure 5d). To further elucidate the difference of lithium storage
performance between pure nickel hydroxide and Fe-doped nickel hydroxide,
CV measurements were conducted with various scan rates from 0.02 to
1.0 mV s–1 (Figure 6b,c). For the pure nickel hydroxide electrode (Figure 6b), with the increase
of scan rate, the redox peaks disappear gradually; at a scan rate
of 0.08 mV s–1, the oxidation and reduction peaks
cannot be discerned, implying the electrochemical reversibility of
pure nickel hydroxide is very poor, especially under the high scan
rate. In contrast, the Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrode shows distinct
redox peaks under all the scan rates (Figure 6c), suggesting its superior electrochemical
reversibility during lithiation/delithiation cycles. It is noted that
the reduction peak is significantly higher than the oxidation peaks,
indicating an obvious kinetic difference between lithiation and delithiation
processes. Under the same scan rate, the redox peak areas of Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide are larger than those of pure nickel hydroxide. This
is in good agreement with the rate performance result (Figure 5d). For the Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide electrode, the peak current (ip) and square root of scan rate (v1/2)
show a linear relationship (Figure 6d). This is a typical diffusion-controlled process.
In this case, the chemical diffusion coefficient of Li+ (DLi) in active materials can be evaluated
based on the Randles–Sevcik equation31,32 1  where ip is the peak current (A), n is the charge
transfer number in the redox process, A is the electrode
area (cm2), CLi is the concentration
of Li+ in the electrode (mol cm–3), and v is the scan rate (V s–1). The calculated
chemical diffusion coefficients of DLi (O1), DLi (O2), and DLi (R) are 3.78 × 10–13, 1.05 ×
10–13, and 3.42 × 10–12 cm2 s–1, respectively.

and Fe-doped nickel hydroxide electrodes at various scan rates. (d)

The superior lithium storage performance of Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide
can be attributed to the unique mixed α-/β-phase composition, mesoporous structure, and synergistic effect between
Ni and Fe dopants. The larger interlayer space of α-motifs in
Fe-doped nickel hydroxide provides fast diffusion paths for Li+; moreover, the structural water molecules in the α-motifs
may also contribute to shielding Li+ from the lattice host
and facilitate the fast diffusion of Li+ in the electrode;
because the valence state of Fe3+ is higher than that of
Ni2+, Fe3+ doping would introduce a large amount
of local structural defects in a nickel hydroxide lattice, such as
vacancies, dislocations, and additional dopant energy levels, which
can increase the electrochemical activity and electronic conductivity.
Therefore, the rate capability of Fe-doped nickel hydroxide is significantly
improved. On the other hand, the larger interlayer space of α-motifs
in Fe-doped nickel hydroxide and the microporous structure could effectively
alleviate the volume changes of the electroactive material during
repeated lithiation/delithiation cycles. Thus, the cycling stability
of Fe-doped nickel hydroxide is remarkably strengthened.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Fe-doped nickel hydroxide was synthesized
by a very
simple chemical co-precipitation method. Because of the unique α-/β-phase
composition, mesoporous structure, and synergistic effect between
Ni and Fe dopants, this Fe-doped nickel hydroxide demonstrated much
improved cycling stability, rate capability, and electrochemical reaction
kinetics as compared to the undoped nickel hydroxide counterpart.
The Fe-doped nickel hydroxide delivered a high specific capacity of
1080 mA h g–1 after 30 cycles at a current density
of 200 mA g–1, which is almost twice that (519 mA
h g–1) of undoped nickel hydroxide. Even at a high
current density of 2000 mA g–1, Fe-doped nickel
hydroxide can still maintain a specific capacity of 661 mA h g–1, far higher than that (182 mA h g–1) of undoped nickel hydroxide. This work provides an effective strategy
for enhancing the lithium storage performance of nickel hydroxide
by metal cation doping. Fe-doped nickel hydroxide has a promising
potential for applications as a novel anode material for next-generation
lithium-ion batteries.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of the Fe-Doped Nickel Hydroxide
Fe-doped
nickel hydroxide was prepared via a very facile chemical
co-precipitation method. In a typical process, 100 mL of NaOH solution
(1 M) was added dropwise into 100 mL of mixed metal nitrate solution
(0.4 M total concentration) containing Ni2+ and Fe3+ (the molar ratio of [Fe3+]/[Ni2+]
is 15%) under continual stirring at 50 °C. After reaction for
3 h, the resulting suspension was kept in a mother solution for 20
h at 60 °C, then filtered, washed to neutral pH with distilled
water, and freeze-dried to a constant weight. For comparison, pure
nickel hydroxide was also prepared by the same procedure described
above but without adding Fe3+ ions.

4.2 Physical
Characterizations
The phase
structure of the prepared samples was studied using multifunction
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Dutch PANalytical X’Pert3 powder) at a scanning speed of 4° min–1.
The surface morphology and element composition of the prepared samples
were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope
(FESEM, Japan Hitachi S-4800) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX, Oxford Instrument) spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared
spectra (FT-IR) were recorded using a FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet
NEXUS 470). Thermal gravity analysis (TGA) was conducted with a thermal
analyzer (American TA SDTQ 600) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 from 25 to 500 °C.
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of the samples
were evaluated by nitrogen adsorption and desorption using a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 analyzer. The tap density of the as-prepared nickel hydroxide
samples was measured as follow: a certain amount of the nickel hydroxide
powder was added into a measuring cylinder; then, the measuring cylinder
was repeatedly taped until the volume of the powder does not decrease;
the ratio between the mass and the volume determines the tap density
of the sample.

4.3 Electrochemical Characterization
The electrochemical performance of the prepared samples was evaluated
in coin-type cells (CR2032), which were assembled in an argon-filled
glove box (Etelux, Lab 2000) with water and oxygen contents below
1 ppm. The working electrodes were fabricated by coating a slurry,
containing prepared nickel hydroxide, acetylene black (Super-P), and
poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) (with a mass ratio of 6:3:1) dispersed
in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), onto a copper
foil substrate. The mass loading of an active material on each working
electrode was ∼0.5 mg cm–2. A Celgard 2400
membrane was used as a separator. Lithium metal foil was used as a
counter electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 solution, consisting
of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and diethyl
carbonate (DEC) with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out
using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E) at ambient temperature.
For the EIS measurement, the frequency range was set from 100 kHz
to 0.01 Hz, with an AC amplitude of 5 mV. The galvanostatic discharge/charge
measurement was performed on an LAND battery testing system (CT-2001C,
Wuhan, China) in a voltage range of 0.02–3.0 V (vs Li/Li+).
