MXenes
are a class of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides
and nitrides that are currently at the forefront of 2D materials research.
In this study, we demonstrate the use of metallically conductive free-standing
films of 2D titanium carbide (MXene) as current-collecting layers
(conductivity of ∼8000 S/cm, sheet resistance of 0.5 Ω/sq)
for battery electrode materials. Multilayer Ti3C2Tx (Tx: surface
functional groups −O, −OH, and −F) is used as
an anode material and LiFePO4 as a cathode material on
5 μm MXene films. Our results show that the capacities and rate
performances of electrode materials using Ti3C2Tx MXene current collectors match those
of conventional Cu and Al current collectors, but at significantly
reduced device weight and thickness. This study opens new avenues
for developing MXene-based current collectors for improving volumetric
and gravimetric performances of energy-storage devices.

1 Introduction
Lightweight, flexible,
portable electronic devices and wearable
gadgets drive demand to develop compact and conformal energy-storage
units.1−3 Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the dominant
technology for portable electronics. These batteries are also taking
over the electric/hybrid electric vehicles market because of their
high energy density and excellent energy efficiency.4,5 Metal current collectors such as copper (Cu) and aluminum (Al) are
typically used as materials for anode and cathode, respectively. However,
they do not contribute to capacity, but add up to the total weight
and volume, thus reducing the overall energy density of LIB cells
significantly. Moreover, the metal surface must be treated to ensure
strong adhesion of electrode materials for minimizing the contact
resistance and increasing capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability
over a pristine metal surface covered with a native oxide layer.6,7 Importantly, the current collector should not only act as an electrical
conductor between the electrode and external circuit but also as a
compatible support for coating of electrode materials while being
lightweight, mechanically strong, and electrochemically stable.

Traditional metal current collectors are considered to be passive
components as they hardly contribute to the overall capacity while
accounting for ∼15% (for Al metal collector) and ∼50%
(for Cu collector) of total weight of the industrial-scale cathodes
and anodes, respectively.8,9 This limitation has
triggered efforts toward developing lightweight current collectors.
A variety of carbon-based current collectors including carbon nanotubes,10−12 carbon paper,13,14 graphene paper,15−17 and carbon fiber18,19 were developed to replace traditional
metal foils. For instance, Wang et al. employed current collectors
based on superaligned carbon nanotube films, which also showed better
wetting, stronger adhesion, and mechanical durability of cast electrode
materials.20 Furthermore, Chen et al. have
employed a highly conductive (∼3000 S/cm) reduced graphene
oxide film produced by current-induced annealing and demonstrated
its applicability as a current collector.21 However, electrical conductivity is still an issue for those carbon-based
current collectors that may need  processing at high temperatures
to improve their conductivity. Thus, the development of solution-processable
two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with high electrical conductivity
and low sheet resistance through ambient processing is important for
fabrication of lightweight current collectors. This is especially
true since such devices should be printable, flexible, transparent,
and/or attached to a variety of surfaces for sensor networks and Internet
of Things applications.

MXenes are a large family of 2D materials,
comprising transition-metal
carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides with a general formula,
Mn+1XnTx, where M is an early transition metal, X is
a carbon or nitrogen, and Tx stands for
various surface terminations (−OH, −O, or −F
groups).22 Because of their compositional
versatility and intriguing physicochemical properties, MXenes have
shown promise in a variety of applications including electromagnetic
interference shielding,23 wireless communication,24 and energy storage.25−32 For instance, titanium carbide (Ti3C2) shows
electrical conductivity  up to 10 000 S/cm33 and is a 2D hydrophilic metal, obtained through
solution processing.34 Recently, Peng et
al. employed large-flake Ti3C2Tx as a current collector for demonstrating all-solid-state
MXene microsupercapacitors without using metal current collectors.35 The metallic electrical conductivity, excellent
flexibility, and mechanical strength of the delaminated Ti3C2Tx (d-Ti3C2Tx) films prompted us to employ
them as current collectors for battery electrodes. Additionally, Ti3C2Tx MXene free-standing
films have density 3 times lower density compared to that of Cu. These
unique characteristics of titanium carbide MXene free-standing films
have hardly been explored.

In this study, we employed a free-standing
Ti3C2Tx film (∼5
μm thickness)
as a current collector for casting anode and cathode materials in
place of Cu and Al current collectors. To demonstrate the proof of
concept, we have used multilayer Ti3C2Tx (ML-Ti3C2Tx) as an anode material and commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) as a cathode material at high mass loadings (2–9
mg/cm2).

2 Results and Discussion
Ti3C2Tx was shown
to exhibit the highest electrical conductivity in the MXene family
and among other solution-processable 2D nanomaterials. Additionally,
we found that thickness of MXene film less than 5 μm is sufficient
for both electrical conduction and mechanical support36 for typical mass loadings of electrode materials in the
range of 2–9 mg/cm2. The delaminated Ti3C2Tx (d-Ti3C2Tx) films (1–5 μm
thick) were made by vacuum-assisted filtration and had a packing density
of ∼3 g/cm3. This shows that the thin layers of
MXene may have an advantage over LIB current collectors, including
Al (thickness = 20 μm, density = 2.7 g/cm3) and Cu
foils (thickness = 12 μm, density = 9 g/cm3).1 The schematic shown in Figure 1a illustrates the comparison between d-Ti3C2Tx free-standing
films and traditional Al and Cu metal current collectors. The density
of d-Ti3C2Tx is
similar to that of Al, while it is 3 times lower compared to that
of Cu. This is an advantage of using Ti3C2Tx MXene current collector for reducing the total
volume and weight of LIB electrodes by at least 3 times.

of the flexible film, and (d) ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx film. CC: current collector; CB: carbon black; PVDF:
poly(vinylidene fluoride).

The XRD patterns of multilayer Ti3C2Tx (ML-Ti3C2Tx) and LiFePO4 cast on d-Ti3C2Tx film are shown in Figure 1b. The d-spacing of   ML-Ti3C2Tx  was found to be  9.6 Å. LiFePO4 XRD pattern is in good agreement with the literature reports. Figure 1c,d shows cross-sectional
images of LiFePO4/d-Ti3C2Tx and ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx electrodes, respectively. As shown in the SEM images,
the interface between d-Ti3C2Tx film and coated layer was uniform without voids or deformation,
confirming the good connection between d-Ti3C2Tx film and electrode materials. The
highly flexible nature of the cast electrode on d-Ti3C2Tx film can be demonstrated through
bending the entire stack to extreme angles, up to 180°, as shown
in the inset of Figure 1c. We have not observed any crack formation after bending the electrode
for repeated bending cycles, indicating the mechanical integrity of
the entire electrode stack (60 μm) on d-Ti3C2Tx film. The optimal thickness
of electrode materials (for single side coating) is found to be 10
times that of MXene film thickness.

The electrochemical performance
of LiFePO4/d-Ti3C2Tx film was studied
at different mass loadings (Figure 2). The cyclic voltammograms of LiFePO4/d-Ti3C2Tx  and bare
d-Ti3C2Tx electrodes
were compared at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s, as shown in Figure 2a. Distinctive sharp oxidation
and reduction peaks were observed at 3.61 and 3.27 V (vs Li/Li+), corresponding to Li+ extraction and insertion
in the LiFePO4 structure (Fe2+/Fe3+), respectively. In contrast, bare d-Ti3C2Tx film showed very low current response in the
cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan, indicating the electrochemical stability
of the compact d-Ti3C2Tx film. Since the mass loading of active layer is >3 mg/cm2, we have not noticed any parasitic reactions due to interaction
of electrolyte with the functional groups on MXene sheets. At such
high mass loadings, MXene serves only as a passive current collector
as it is coated densely by the electrode materials.

Figure 2 Electrochemical performance

voltammograms of LFP/d-Ti3C2Tx and d-Ti3C2Tx films at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s. (b) Charge/discharge profiles
of LFP/d-Ti3C2Tx at various C-rates, (c) rate performance, and (d) capacity versus
C-rates at different mass loadings of 2.7, 7.1, and 8.7 mg/cm2.

Figure 2b shows
charge/discharge profiles of LiFePO4 (7.1 mg/cm2) measured in the range of 0.15C–6C rates, and the corresponding
discharge capacities were estimated to be 155, 147, 137, 117, 97,
and 62 mAh/g. As shown in Figure 2c, when the C-rate is increased from 0.15 to 6C, the
electrode retains 40% of its initial capacity, which means that the
conductivity of d-Ti3C2Tx film is sufficient for characterizing the electrochemical
performance of LiFePO4 electrodes at a thickness of 60
μm. After reverting to 0.15C rate, the capacity rebounded to
its initial values (155 mAh/g and 165 mAh/cm3) and remained
stable, confirming the reversibility and suggesting that no degradation
occurred during high-rate cycling of LiFePO4/d-Ti3C2Tx electrodes. Figure 2d shows the capacity
versus C-rate measured for different LiFePO4 loadings (2.7,
7.1, and 8.7 mg/cm2) on d-Ti3C2Tx film. Even at a mass loading of 8.7 mg/cm2, LFP electrode showed a capacity of 122 mAh/g at 1.2 C rate, which matches with the literature
reports employing traditional Al current collectors at similar mass
loadings of electrode materials.37

Ti3C2Tx MXene
has been explored for electrochemical storage because of its layered
morphology with electrochemically active surfaces available
for metal-ion storage.27−30,38,39 Electrochemical performance of ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a compares the CV profiles of ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx electrode and bare d-Ti3C2Tx film at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s. As
shown in the CV curves, the capacity of bare d-Ti3C2Tx film is much smaller than that
of ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx electrode, meaning
that the major capacity contribution is from the top ML-Ti3C2Tx. The typical areal mass
loading of ML-Ti3C2Tx is ∼3.9 mg/cm2. Sloping charge/discharge profiles
are typical of MXenes electrodes, as shown in Figure 3b,c. ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx electrode showed first-cycle Coulombic efficiency
of 67% at a current density of 25 mA/g and stabilized capacity of
180 mAh/g after fifth cycle. When current density was increased to
1 A/g, the capacity decreased to 87 mAh/g with 48% capacity retention
(Figure 3d). The capacity
also rebounded to the initial value of 180 mAh/g (Figure 3d) by reverting current density
to 25 mA/g, indicating good rate capability and reversibility of ML-Ti3C2Tx/d-Ti3C2Tx electrode.

(b) Charge–discharge curves for first, fifth, and sixth cycles
at a current density of 25 mA/g. (c) Charge–discharge curves

and volumetric capacities at varied current densities.

The realized capacity of the electrodes was calculated
by considering
the total weight (estimated on the basis of density of the current
collectors but not relying on the absolute thickness values), including
current collector and active material stack used for testing half-cell
measurements. There is not much gain using MXene current collector
instead of Al because of same values of density in both cases (at
the same thickness level). As shown in Figure 4, the gravimetric capacity obtained using
d-Ti3C2Tx film is
3 times higher than using a Cu foil as a current collector. This is
clearly an advantage for using highly conductive MXene films, which
can effectively reduce the total weight of the anode stack of LIB.
This study is a demonstration of the concept of using MXene current
collectors; however, future studies should focus on the influence
of the surface functionality of MXenes on the contact impedance using
systematic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigations and
further improvements through surface modifications.

Figure 4 Realized capacity (based
on the total weight of active materials
and the current collector) of ML-Ti3C2Tx (on a Cu foil) and ML-Ti3C2Tx (on d-Ti3C2Tx film) electrodes at different current densities.

Although this study demonstrated
the feasibility of MXene thin
films as current collectors in small devices, the thermal characteristics
of MXene films should be studied to ensure efficient heat dissipation
during battery cycling. Heat produced during charging/discharging
of battery electrodes in large-size batteries can be dissipated easily
if the current collector has a high thermal conductivity. Tensile
strength of MXene current collectors should also be investigated to
ensure that winding of electrodes is possible. However, the available
data on single-layer MXene flakes40 and
films41 suggest that the required mechanical
strength can be achieved. However, there is no published information
about thermal conductivity of Ti3C2 films. Future
investigations should focus on these issues to validate the viability
of MXene films as current collectors in a variety of batteries.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated application of a highly
conductive thin d-Ti3C2Tx current collector
for cathode and anode electrode materials instead of traditional metal
collectors. Ti3C2Tx film showed compatibility with coatings of LiFePO4 and
ML-Ti3C2Tx electrodes
without additional surface treatments. Compared to Cu metal foil,
d-Ti3C2Tx film offered
reduced cell weight and improved volumetric capacity for anode electrode
stack. Our results suggest that MXene current collector could be a
potential candidate for developing flexible and lightweight energy-storage
devices.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fabrication
of Ti3C2Tx Films
All chemicals were
used as received without further purification. Layered ternary carbide
Ti3AlC2 (MAX phase) powder (particle size <40
μm) was obtained from Carbon-Ukraine, Ltd. Ti3C2Tx MXene was synthesized following
the minimal intensive layer delamination method by selective etching
of aluminum from Ti3AlC2 using in situ hydrofluoric
acid (HF)-forming etchant, as previously reported elsewhere.34 Herein, 1 g of Ti3AlC2 powder was slowly added into a solution of 1 g of lithium fluoride
(LiF, Alfa Aesar, >98%) in 20 mL of 9 M hydrochloric acid (HCl,
Fisher,
technical grade, 35–38%) and stirred for 24 h at 35 °C.
The acidic suspension was washed with deionized (DI) water until pH
≥ 6 via centrifugation at 3500 rpm (5 min per cycle) and decantation
of the supernatant after each cycle. Around pH ≥ 6, a stable
dark-green supernatant of Ti3C2Tx was observed and then collected after 30 min centrifugation
at 3500 rpm. The resulting delaminated Ti3C2Tx (d-Ti3C2Tx) was filtered and dried under vacuum at 70
°C overnight to obtain free-standing films.

4.2 Synthesis of Multilayer Ti3C2Tx
The etching solution
was prepared by adding 1 mL of concentrated HF to 9 mL of H2O to produce 5 wt % HF, which was used for etching 1 g of Ti3AlC2 powder. While stirring at 400 rpm, Ti3AlC2 powder was slowly added to the etchants and
the temperature of the bath was raised to 40 °C after the complete
addition of MAX powder and the reaction was continued for 15 h. Furthermore,
washing was done with DI water via centrifugation for 5 min at 3500
rpm several times. The colorless acidic supernatant was decanted after
each wash until reaching pH ≥ 6. After this stage, the product
was collected via vacuum filtration over a filter membrane with pore
size less than 0.45 μm. Then, the obtained powder sample was
dried at 200 °C under vacuum for 12 h.

4.3 Materials
Characterization
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis of  ML-Ti3C2Tx, and LiFePO4 (MTI Corp.,
product #EQ-Lib-LFPOKJ2) was performed on a Rigaku Smart Lab (Tokyo,
Japan) diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406
Å. Voltage and current settings were 40 kV and 44 mA, respectively,
with a step scan of 0.04°, 2θ range 5–50°,
and dwell time of 0.5 s. The cross sections of the samples were imaged
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Zeiss Supra 50VP, Germany).
The electrical conductivity of the samples was measured using a four-point
probe (ResTest v1, Jandel Engineering Ltd., Bedfordshire, U.K.) with
a probe distance of 1 mm.

4.4 Coin Cell Assembly and
Electrochemical Analysis
LiFePO4 (MTI Corp., product
#EQ-Lib-LFPOKJ2) and ML-Ti3C2Tx were used as active
materials to cast on d-Ti3C2Tx films. The electrodes were prepared by mixing active materials
(80 wt %), carbon black (10 wt %), and poly(vinylidene difluoride)
binder (10 wt %) in N-methylpyrrolidone to make a
slurry separately. After mixing, a uniform slurry was coated on d-Ti3C2Tx film and dried
under vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h. For comparison, LiFePO4 and Ti3C2Tx slurries
were coated on Al and Cu foils, respectively, using the same procedure
mentioned above.

After drying, electrodes were roll-pressed
and punched to match the required dimensions of CR2032 coin cell.
A lithium foil was used as the reference and counter electrode for
half-cell measurements. Celgard polypropylene membrane was used as
a separator between working electrodes and Li metal. 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate with
a volume ratio of 1:1 was used as the electrolyte. The CR2032 coin
cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox (VT, Vacuum Technologies)
with moisture and oxygen levels less than 0.1 ppm. Charge–discharge
measurements were performed at different current densities in the
potential windows matching the chosen electrode system using an Arbin
battery tester (Arbin BT-2143-11U, College Station, TX). Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) was conducted using VMP3 (BioLogic, France) between 0.01 and
3.0 V versus Li/Li+ at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s.
