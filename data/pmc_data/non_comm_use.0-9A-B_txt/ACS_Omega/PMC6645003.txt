Energy dissipation due to friction
and wear is reducing the energy
efficiency and reliability of mechanical systems. Thus, great efforts
are being made to minimize friction for technical applications. In
our present work, we investigate the tribological behavior of stainless
steel 100Cr6 with a-C:H and a-C:H:Si coating lubricated with a surface-active
formanisotropic 1,3-diketone. The results show that superlow friction
can be achieved on the macroscale using a steel 100Cr6 self pairing
(COF ∼ 0.005) and with 100Cr6 in combination with a-C:H coating
(COF ∼ 0.008). Furthermore, the replacement of steel with a-C:H
coating leads to a considerable decrease of wear. The reduced COF
arises from the chemical interaction of the lubricant with the surface
and nascent iron ions. It was found that interfacial parameters correlate
with tribological results. In addition, the alignment of the formanisotropic
molecules in the tribological contact at thin-film lubrication leads
to an anisotropic viscosity with a minimum shear resistance in sliding
direction. Atomistic simulation of tribochemical interactions was
conducted to derive a friction model based on the thin-film lubrication
theory. This investigation indicates the potential to substantially
reduce friction and wear using this fluid in real technical applications.

Introduction
Since the energy efficiency
of technical systems has become more
important due to environmental specifications, there is a great demand
to improve the tribological performance of all energy-consuming applications.
The demand for cost savings and higher reliability of technical systems
requires the development of novel lubrication systems to minimize
friction and wear.1−3 This global challenge can be summarized in the topics
“sustainable” or “green” tribology.4 In this context “superlubricity”
is one of the keywords which was mentioned first by Shinjo and Hirano.5 They characterized the superlubric state as a
regime where two contacting solid surfaces slide against each other
almost without any resistance. From an atomistic point of view friction
can nearly vanish when incommensurate crystal lattices or orientations
are brought into contact6 and in the case
of weak interfacial interactions.7 In contrast,
in real multidimensional macroscopic contacts friction and wear occur
and cause energy losses. Thus, on the macroscopic scale a coefficient
of friction (COF) of μ < 0.01 is referred to as extremely
low friction,8 superlubricity,8 or superlow friction according to the classification
given by Kano et al.9 Erdemir and Martin
published a review of tribological systems, where so-called “superglide”,
“superlubricity”, or “superlubrication”
is realized on specific hard contacts (e.g., diamond-like carbon,
DLC) and incommensurate contacts between layered crystals (graphite,
molybdenum disulfide MoS2). Biomimetic systems, like the
vertebrate joint, can also reach superlubricity.10 The specific property to obtain low friction despite high
compression resistance in a soft system is related to the formation
of brushes on the surface which generate a protective layer. The latest
developments concerning friction properties of synthetic brushes are
summarized by J. Klein.11 Kupchinov et
al. verified that the synovial fluid existing in human joints contains
liquid-crystalline substances (cholesterol esters).12 Due to microgrooves on the cartilage these molecules align
parallel to the sliding direction. Thus, the wear-intensive boundary
friction is prevented by these ordered layers which form due to the
liquid-crystalline properties of the synovial fluid. Our preliminary
studies showed the possibility to realize superlow friction in combination
with steel surfaces at low contact pressure.13−16

Efficient wear protection
is achieved by diamond-like carbon (DLC)
coatings. Despite the successful application of DLC coatings in unlubricated
systems there is still a demand by industry to improve the tribological
behavior of coated surfaces in a manifold of lubricated systems.17 Nowadays, commercial lubricants contain additives
of special surface-active substances (friction modifiers FM, extreme
pressure additives EP) to improve the tribological performance of
technical systems.17 However, synthetic
or mineral oils are in a particular range limited in terms of energy
efficiency due to their isotropic viscosity. Despite their chemical
inertness, tribochemical interactions were observed for DLC coatings
with various lubricant additives.18 Doping
metals (W, Ti, Cr, etc.) or nonmetals (Si, O, N, F, B) strongly influence
the properties of DLC coatings.19 In addition,
DLC coatings with higher sp3 content (ta-C) exhibit superior
mechanical properties20 and obtain ultralow
friction behavior under glycerol and oleic acid lubrication in contrast
to a-C:H,9,21 which is known for ultralow friction in
an inert atmosphere at dry lubrication.20,22,23 Especially at boundary lubrication, where the interaction
of lubricant with the surface (physisorption or chemisorption) plays
an important role, the tribological mechanisms are not fully understood.
Therefore, the analysis of these interactions is the key factor to
develop an optimized lubricated DLC-coated system. Realizing superlubricity
at the macroscale in these systems would be highly valuable for engineering
applications, but there are many challenges for example issues with
structural defects.24 A recently published
study demonstrates the possibility to realize superlubricity at the
engineering scale by the application of graphene with nanodiamond
particles and diamondlike carbon with the restriction to a dry environment.25 A more detailed review of the state of the art
using different DLC coatings is presented in the Supporting Information.

The thin-film lubrication theory
(TFL) given by Zhang26 describes the friction
system at minimum friction
as a complex interaction of an adsorbed film on the surface followed
by an ordered film and a fluid film in the bulk of the friction gap.
An overview about the most important findings concerning TFL in the
past 20 years was currently given by L. Ma and J. Luo.27 They summarized that molecular polarity and
tribological load (speed, film thickness) play an important role regarding
the degree of molecular ordering in TFL. A polar molecule aligns perpendicular
to the solid under static conditions and changes to a parallel orientation
along the dynamic direction in the bulk. In contrast, nonpolar molecules
are more disordered in the lubrication gap, and no TFL regime is formed.
In addition, the characteristics of the solid surface have strong
effect on TFL due to chemical and physical interactions. Therefore,
important parameters to analyze wetting and absorption processes are
the surface tension of the lubricant and the surface energy of the
solid. The no-slip boundry condition at hydrodynamic lubrication is
caused as the adhesive force between solid and liquid is stronger
than the cohesive force among liquid molecules.28 It was found that higher surface energy results in thicker
lubricating films for mineral oils. Based on this, it was measured
that low adsorption forces between the tribo-pairs prevail at high
contact angles, and lower coefficients of friction are obtained since
the thin lubrication film forming depends on the adhesive strength
between liquid and solid.28,29 Furthermore, hydrodynamic
lubrication experiments with lubrication film thickness analysis revealed
that additional interfacial parameters such as the spreading parameter
(SP) and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) describe solid–liquid
interaction more accurately for dynamic systems at the static contact
angle.28 Guo et al.28 demonstrated full-slip without molecular bonding at SP
< 0 accompanied by lower film thickness and decrease of shear stress
and adhesion strength. Higher film thickness was observed at increasing
values for CAH in which the authors summarized the CAH as the best
interfacial parameter to determine lubrication behavior.

The
hypothesis of this work is based on this model in the way that
superlow friction is assumed to be realized in a macroscopic contact
if the thin-film lubrication regime gets achieved using a formanisotropic
fluid. The used 1,3-diketone is formanisotropic because it possesses
an elongated shape with a molecular length being significantly greater
than the molecular breadth. Therefore, requirements are a physical
and chemical interaction of lubricant and surface to form an adsorbed
triboactive layer, and second the shape anisotropy of the molecules
has to cause a specific orientation with an anisotropic viscosity
(minimal in sliding direction and maximal in perpendicular direction).

Due to the inapplicable interaction of lubricants with a-C:H coatings,
improved tribological behavior has only been observed at dry conditions
under inert atmosphere so far. Therefore, the main goal of this investigation
is to analyze the macroscopic tribological behavior of two different
a-C:H coatings compared to uncoated steel lubricated with a formanisotropic
1,3-diketone. To verify the mechanisms based on thin-film theory interfacial
parameters are analyzed and correlated with the tribological findings.
Our own investigations have so far led to the assumption that iron
is a necessary friction partner due to a tribochemical reaction in
combination with the diketone to achieve superlow friction. This finding
should be confirmed within this work to expand the knowledge about
the physical and chemical interactions in this tribological system.
In addition, the shear-induced alignment of the molecules and resulting
impact on viscosity is calculated using molecular dynamic simulations.
The tribological results are contrasted to the commercially available
highly optimized standard oil Optigear32. Both experimental and simulation
work are used to identify and understand the friction mechanisms in
the superlow friction regime regarding thin-film lubrication theory.

Experimental
Section
Tribological Tests
Friction tests were performed using
a rotating B3P (Figure 2a, Figure S1) lubricated with a specific
formanisotropic fluid, named EPND-02/06 (Figure S2). This molecule can be approximated as an ellipsoid in which
the half axes a (0.51 nm), b (0.64
nm), and c (1.75 nm) were calculated by means of
molecular dynamics simulations. The aspect ratio, the degree of formanisotropy,
is thus calculated to be approximately 3:1. The test specimens were
cleaned before each tribological test using acetone, ethanol, and
Tickopur R33 universal ultrasonic cleaner. The measuring cell was
filled with 1 mL of lubricant. Since it is difficult to measure superlow
friction accurately a rheometer (Co. Anton Paar MCR501) with a tribological
measuring cell (rotating ball-on-3-plates) was used. The rheometer
used as a tribometer is able to measure friction forces between 0.01
and 44.5 N (min. torque of 2 nNm), which corresponds to a minimal
coefficient of friction of 0.0005 at 20 N normal load. The surface
topography and roughness of the different materials are quite similar
(Table 1, Figure S3). Two different test methods were performed:
sequenced tribotests and duration tests. Sequenced tribotests consist
of five sequences which were carried out successively: 5 static friction
measurements (10 N, 100 °C); first conditioning at constant parameters
(3 h, 10 N, 100 °C, 0.1 m s–1); 5 static friction
measurements (10 N, 100 °C); second conditioning (1 h, 10 N,
100 °C, 0.1 m s–1); and 5 speed ramps (10 N,
100 °C, 0–1.55 m s–1). Static friction
measurements were carried out by increasing the torque of the upper
sample until the ball starts to move (breakaway torque). During speed
ramps the velocity was increased logarithmically. In addition, tribological
tests with constant parameters (20 N, 100 °C) were conducted.
These duration tribotests were carried out to analyze the running-in
and wear behavior under mixed lubrication (10 h, 0.47 m s–1) and in the hydrodynamic regime at higher speeds (5 h, 1.06 m s–1). Testing time at higher speed was reduced to 5 h
compared to the tests at 0.47 m s–1 to reach a comparable
sliding distance.

For this study a specific fluid,
named EPND-02/06 (1-(4-ethyl phenyl)nonane-1,3-dione,
Co. Nematel GmbH), was used for the tribological tests. EPND-02/06
shows a keto–enol tautomerism, wherein the enol form is favored
(90%) in contrast to the keto form (10%) at room temperature. Steel
100Cr6 was used as reference because of its possibility to realize
superlow friction in combination with EPND-02/06. The tribological
performance of EPND-02/06 (Nematel GmbH, 7 mPa·s at 40 °C)
is compared with the mineral-based oil Optigear32 (Castrol, 29 mPa·s
at 40 °C), due to its comparable viscosity, area of application,
and advantages (long-term and lifetime lubrication, reduction of the
coefficient of friction, reduced energy, maintenance, and disposal
costs).30 We used a PECVD method to produce
DLC films on polished 1.4301 stainless steel surfaces. Before coating
the substrates were cleaned and activated using argon plasma. Opposite
to the gas inlet on the bottom of the chamber, the water-cooled radio
frequency (RF) steel electrode (13.56 MHz) is located. Using mass
flow controllers the gas flow rates can be adjusted. The process pressure
is induced with a rotary vane pump (Pfeiffer DUO 65C) and a turbo
molecular pump (Leybold Turbovac 450).31 Improved adhesion of the coating is realized using a 500 nm thick
silicon-based TMS undercoating (trimethylsilyl). The DLC coatings
contain 30–35 at % hydrogen. Si-DLC was used due to its advantages
concerning friction, wear, and other material characteristics (e.g.,
reduced residual internal stress, improved film adhesion tailoring
of hardness, thermal stability is improved, reduced surface tension,
corrosion resistance).32

Analysis
Ultramicrohardness measurements of substrate
and DLC coatings were performed using a Nanoindenter (Fischerscope
H100C, Co. Helmut Fischer GmbH) according to ISO 14577 (Table 1). Surface roughness (Table 1, Figure S3) and wear volume of ball and plates were measured
using a laser microscope (VK-9710, Co. Keyence Corporation). In addition,
the DLC coatings were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy (inVia confocal,
Co. Renisaw) to quantify the proportion of sp2 and sp3 before and after tribological tests. FT-IR-spectroscopy (620
IR Imaging Microscope, Co. Varian) was applied to analyze the 1,3-diketone
after the tribological tests. The chemical compositions of the different
materials were quantified with scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
S-3400N, Co Hitachi, Table 1) and XPS analysis (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Leybold
MAX 100; argon ion sputtering with sputter rate: 2.5 nm/min; 1 kV;
500 nA; diameter test point ∼200 μm).

Wetting and
Spreading
Static and dynamic interfacial
parameters were measured to analyze the adhesive strengths between
liquid and solid in the frictional contact, in order to get a deeper
understanding of the prevailing tribological mechanisms. Adhesion
work per area W12 represents the energy
required to separate two connected surfaces of different materials
1 and 2 in vacuum from the contact into infinity. If two surfaces
of identical material are involved, the adhesion work is designated
analogously to W11. Thereby, the surface
energy γ is the energy required to increase the surface for
one unit area. In order to form a new surface with one unit area,
two half-surface units must be separated from the contact into infinity,
so that the relation between surface energy and adhesion work per
surface W12 can be described as 1  In contact with a second phase, the extent
of adhesive interactions (work of adhesion WA) depends on whether similar interactions can be formed with
the adjacent phase. This can be seen from the equation according to
Owens, Wendt, Rabel, and Kaelble,33 for
example: 2  

The direct determination of the adhesion
work or surface energy of a solid is practically impossible. Therefore,
the surface energy is indirectly determined, for example, with contact
angle measurements. Surface energies were calculated using the Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble
(OWRK) method:33 3  For that purpose contact angles (θ)
using the sessile drop method (contact angle system OCA20, Co. Data
Physics, fluid volume: 1 μL, efflux rate: 1 μL/s) were
measured with three liquids (L) with well-defined properties.34 We used demineralized water (polar), ethylene
glycol (partially polar), and diiodomethane (nonpolar) as model liquids.
Surface tension of lubricants was measured using the pendant-drop
method (efflux rate: 1 μL/s).35 The
polar and dispersive components of surface tension were measured and
calculated by measuring contact angles using the sessile drop technique
on a purely dispersive solid (PTFE, total = dispersive component of
surface tension: 23.53 mN/m34) with transposing
the Young–Dupré equation according to34,36,37 4  In addition, by using the Young equation37 and the OWRK model33 M. Kalin and M.
Polajnar34 derived an
equation with which the spreading properties of liquids can be calculated
and characterized: 5  The spreading parameter results from the difference
between the work of adhesion WA and the
work of cohesion WC. It was found that
the spreading parameter (SP) describes the actual wetting properties
of DLC coatings and steel with lubricants instead of the contact angle.38,43 According to the Fowkes method, the interfacial tension γSL is calculated based on the two surface tensions γS and γL and their polar and dispersive components.
These interactions describe the geometric mean of a disperse part
γD and a polar part γP of the surface
tension or surface free energy: 6  Since lubrication processes are dynamic and,
in the case of real applications, appear on heterogeneous and rough
surfaces, it can be useful to determine the advancing (θA) and receding (θR) contact angle in order
to derive correlations between wettability and tribological behavior:28 7   8  On ideal solid surfaces
there is no hysteresis,
and the single static contact angle is equal to the dynamic contact
angle as no metastable states arise on the surface. Due to liquid
flowing, extra forces Fin and Fout arise on the liquid/solid contact. From
both values the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) can be calculated 9  The fluid volume for advancing contact angle
measurement was set to 4 μL, and the receding contact angle
was measured by extracting 2 μL with an efflux rate of 1 μL/s.
The CAH parameter describes the solid/liquid adhesive force.39,40 Whyman et al. calculated this affinity between liquid and solid
and found that liquid molecules which slide on solid molecules have
to overcome a specific potential energy barrier. This energy barrier
is related to CAH and contact angle θ (no correlation between
20° < θ < 140°) and increases with higher adhesive
force.41

Results
Interfacial
Parameters
Surface energies (γS) of the
different solid materials and their dispersive (D)
and polar (P) properties were measured using sessile drop method.
According to findings in the literature 100Cr6 has a higher surface
energy than the DLC coatings with the highest polar ratio (Figure 1a). Si doping increases
the surface energy and the polar portion compared to pure DLC. The
contact angle on PTFE for Optigear32 is 59.6° ± 2.5°
and for EPND-02/06 is 52.8° ± 3.3°. In combination
with the measured surface tension using the pendant drop method the
polar and dispersive components of the lubricants were calculated.
Optigear32 exhibits a slightly higher surface tension (γL) than EPND-02/06 with a more distinctive polar component
(Figure 2b). Based on these values the interaction of solid
and lubricant can be estimated by the spreading parameter (SP) since
a solid surface becomes completely wetted when SP > 0 in order
to
lower its surface energy, and partial wetting occurs for SP < 0.
Optigear32 exhibits higher SP values than EPND-02/06 in combination
with 100Cr6 and Si-DLC and nearly the same SP with DLC (Figure 1c). The negative value of SP
for DLC indicates that work of adhesion on the solid–oil interface
is lower than the cohesion work between molecules within the oils.
This results in no spreading due to low affinity of the oil to the
surface. In conclusion, lower SP indicates more oleophobic behavior
which means poorer, oil-wetting behavior for the DLC coatings compared
to the steel accompanied by slip at the oil–DLC interface.
Results of contact angle hysteresis, measured by advancing and receding
contact angle, indicate that the adhesive strength between solid and
liquid molecules which overcomes the potential energy barrier and
leaning-to slippage is better for Optigear32 than for EPND-02/06 and
nearly independent of material (Figure 1d). In contrast, for EPND-02/06 the CAH strongly depends
on the substrate, whereas DLC exhibits the highest CAH.

friction state between 1.0 and 1.5 m s–1 with COF
∼ 0.008 ± 0.001 for the 100Cr6 ball against DLC plates
and COF ∼ 0.004 ± 0.001 for the 100Cr6 ball against 100Cr6
plates).

Tribological Results
Two different tribological tests
were performed using a rotating ball-on-3-plates-geometry, B3P (Figure 2a): sequenced tribotests
and duration tests. The sequenced tribotests were performed successively
to measure static friction and velocity dependency of friction (Stribeck
behavior). Furthermore, the long-term friction and wear behavior was
analyzed by duration tests. We demonstrate in both tests the appearance
of macroscopic superlow friction using the specific formanisotropic
1,3-diketone EPND-02/06.

The mean values of the coefficient
of static friction are illustrated in Figure 2b. The 1,3-diketone shows higher static friction
than the reference oil in combination with all tested combinations
with 100Cr6. In contrast to Optigear32, which has the lowest static
friction in combination with 100Cr6, EPND-02/06 exhibits the lowest
static friction performance for the DLC/DLC pairing. All surfaces
exhibit nearly the same roughness, which strongly affects static friction.
The measured diversity in tribological behavior indicates the importance
of chemical interactions of the fluid with the surface.42 Speed-ramps for EPND-02/06 reveal very strong
velocity dependence of the friction behavior (Figure 2c). The COF decreases to a superlow value
using a 100Cr6 ball in combination with DLC (∼0.008) or 100Cr6
(∼0.004) between 1.0 m s–1 and 1.5 m s–1. Si-DLC/100Cr6 and the DLC self-pairing start at
a lower COF than the other pairings but do not reach superlow COF.
Optigear32 reaches a stable COF of ∼0.075 well above superlow
friction at increasing velocity, rather independent of the choice
of material (Figure 2d).

Due to the results of speed ramp for EPND-02/06 friction
tests
at constant, test parameters were performed at 0.47 m s–1 and 1.06 m s–1 to analyze the tribological behavior
when the test starts at mixed lubrication and hydrodynamic conditions,
respectively. Friction values at constant test parameters (20 N, 100
°C, velocity 0.47 m s–1) reveal a strong running-in
effect for EPND-02/06 as illustrated in Figure 3a. The three material combinations 100Cr6/DLC,
100Cr6/100Cr6, and DLC/DLC show a strongly decreasing COF after an
initial running-in phase with the lowest COF of ∼0.005 for
100Cr6/DLC. This behavior is not observed for Si-DLC-coated plates,
where the friction strongly scatters after 1 h and the COF increases
to ∼0.15. In contrast, at higher sliding velocity (1.06 m s–1), running-in time until the superlow friction state
for material combinations 100Cr6/DLC (COF ∼ 0.008), 100Cr6/Si-DLC
(COF ∼ 0.007), and 100Cr6/100Cr6 (COF ∼ 0.005) is reached
reduces (Figure 3c).
Higher sliding speed, and therefore less boundry lubrication, has
the most positive effect on the performance for Si-DLC as COF also
decreases in contrast to lower sliding velocity. As illustrated in Figure 3b using Optigear32
only a slight running-in effect is observed during the first hour.
Afterward it shows a constant and for all material combinations comparable
COF in the range of 0.060 and 0.065. Nearly the same tribological
behavior is measured for Optigear32 at sliding velocity of 1.06 m
s–1 (Figure 3d). Regarding energy consumption ∼70% less friction
work has to be expended using EPND-02/06 than Optigear32 at 0.47 m
s–1 for the tested material combinations with the
exception of Si-DLC (Figure 3e). At 1.06 m s–1 (Figure 3f) the reduction is even higher, up to 80–90%
compared to Optigear32, whereas with DLC/DLC self-pairing it is only
60%.

friction work using EPND-02/06 and Optigear32 at 0.47 m s–1 (e) and at 1.06 m s–1 (f).

Wear analysis after duration-tribotests was performed using
laser
microscope. The wear pattern of material combination 100Cr6/DLC lubricated
with EPND-02/06 and Optigear32 at 0.47 (Figure 4.a) and 1.06 ms–1 (Figure 4.b) show wear grooves
in sliding direction on both materials. It can be seen that there
are very large differences concerning wear volume within the material
pairings and lubricants. With exception of material combination 100Cr6/DLC
(−24% using EPND-02/06) less wear is generated with Optigear32
than EPND-02/06 at 0.47 ms–1 (Figure 4.c). The high coefficient of friction using
Si-doped DLC with EPND-02/06 is accompanied by severe wear and damage
of the coating. There is nearly no difference in the wear volume using
100Cr6 ball with DLC, Si-DLC and 100Cr6 for Optigear32. The lowest
wear volumes are realized using DLC/DLC self-pairing for both lubricants.
The resulting wear volumes are more comparable between EPND-02/06
and Optigear32 at 1.06 ms–1 (Figure 4.d) than at lower speed. At higher speed
lower wear volumes were measured with exception of DLC/DLC self-pairing
in which clearly more wear was generated than at 0.47 ms–1. Using Optigear32 DLC-coating is damaged on ball and plates whereas
using EPND-02/06 only the coating on the plates is delaminated and
not on the ball. The worn surfaces and profiles reveal enormous differences
for the wear behavior of ball and plates and also the resulting contact
pressure strongly differs (Table 2). The difference between the resulting contact pressure
using EPND-02/06 and Optigear32 nearly decreases at higher velocity
using coated samples. Although the plates are always in frictional
contact with the ball the plates show less wear. This behavior could
be related to the high hardness of the coatings in contrast to the
100Cr6 material.

Investigations of the Tribolayer
IR spectroscopy was
performed after sequenced tribotests to analyze the chemical reaction
products of the 1,3-diketone with the steel surface (Figure 5a). It was found that the diketone
reacts with nascent iron ions to chelate complexes: Additional signals
at 1540, 1520, and 1385 cm–1 indicate the formation
of the chelate complex of the formanisotropic fluid with iron15 (Table 3). No further oxidation reaction was detected by IR spectroscopy,
since there were no significant differences in the spectra at wavenumbers
between 1650 and 1800 cm–1 (Figure 5a). After friction tests using DLC self-pairing
also a complex was detected due to the fact that the tests were carried
out in an iron sample holder, and the plates were only coated on the
top side but were fully immersed in EPND-02/06.

Raman spectroscopy was used to
analyze the DLC coatings before
and after tribological tests. The D and G bands are located at 1360
and 1560 cm–1 and correspond to sp3 and
sp2 sites, respectively.43 The
change from nanocrystalline graphite to sp2 a-C goes along
with a topological disorder in the graphite layer with weaker bonds,
so that the position of the G peak is shifted from 1560 to 1500 cm–1.44 The G peak is measured
for the new DLC coating at 1533 cm–1 which indicates
∼60% sp2 (Figure 5b).43 This signal is also
a typical fingerprint of polymeric DLC.45,46 After duration
friction tests there is no change of G peak position and only a slight
change of sp2/sp3 ratio. Using the material
combination 100Cr6/DLC sp3 content increases for ∼3%
with EPND-02/06 at 0.47 (a) and 1.06 m s–1, whereas
with Optigear a smaller change of only ∼1% was measured. The
same tendency was found with DLC/DLC self pairing as sp3 content strongly changes using EPND-02/06 (−1%) compared
to that with Optiogear32 (0%). Due to the high relative amount of
Si the G peak position is shifted from 1500 to 1440 cm–1 for the Si-doped DLC coating but is not influenced by tribological
impact. No transfer layer on the steel counterbody was detected after
the friction tests with the exception of material combination of 100Cr6/Si-DLC
lubricated with EPND-02/06 at 0.47 m s–1. This slightly
indicated that D and G bands were measured in some wear grooves on
the worn area of 100Cr6 due to the severe wear on Si-DLC.

In
addition, the change of the surface after the friction test
was analyzed by measuring the microhardness (HV0.031) and the E-modulus [EIT in GPa]. After duration tribotests at 0.47
m s–1 (Figure 5c) microhardness and EIT of DLC strongly increase for
about 20–40%. On Si-doped DLC and 100Cr6 nearly no change after
friction test was measured. Worn Si-DLC using EPND-02/06 could not
be measured as the coating was damaged after the test. At higher speed
there is also an increase of HV0.031 using EPND-02/06 (+38%) but a
decrease (−18%) using Optigear32 (Figure 5d).

Similarly to surface-active (polar)
friction additives, the 1,3-diketone
can react with the surface and form a tribo film on a metal surface,
which improves the tribological behavior.14,47 This interaction improves the tribological performance, especially
in the boundary lubrication regime.48 The
tribological performance of metal tribosystems can be improved by
using additives with more polar groups.49 The high hardness of DLC coatings enables low wear but results in
higher friction.47 To analyze surface-near
chemical interactions and the distribution of elements within the
tribologically influenced boundary layer XPS measurements of the plates
were carried out. The first 2 nm of DLC coating consists of 2 at %
oxygen and 98 at % carbon (graphite, 90% C–C and 10% C–O–C
bonds) with a depth of 10 nm and a constant oxygen content of ∼0.5
at %. Within the first 10 nm Si-DLC is composed of 8 at % oxygen,
64 at % carbon, and 28 at % silicon (15% Si–C and 85% Si–O
bonds). In contrast, the surface layer of new 100Cr6 material is much
thicker (60 nm) and contains in the first 2 nm 31 at % oxygen, 46
at % carbon, 20 at % iron, 2.5 at % sulfur, and 0.5 at % chromium.
Iron oxide is measured within the first 10 nm plus oxygen, alkyl,
carbide, and hydrocarbon groups which are detectable to a depth of
60 nm. After duration tribotest (5 h, 20 N, 100 °C, 1.06 m s–1) surface layers with different thickness and composition
are formed. As illustrated in Figure 5e this surface layer is only about 10 nm thick if DLC
and Si-DLC coating remains undamaged. In contrast, the wear tracks
on 100Cr6 (Figure 5f, DLC coating on plate damaged after DLC self-pairing friction test)
show a much thicker surface layer. In the following, the most important
findings from the XPS analyses are listed according to the friction
tests. In addition, the elements on a worn area of the plate within
the first 3 nm are listed in Table 4.100Cr6/100Cr6;
EPND-02/06: First 2 nm oxide (23 at%)
and carbon (66 at) and only 10 at % iron (C–H, O–Me,
O–C, Fe-oxide, Cr-oxide, carbides). Thickness of tribologically
influenced boundary layer ∼600 nm.

100Cr6/100Cr6; Optigear32: Surface near iron oxide,
carbon (C–H, 35 at %) sulfide, carbide, molybdenum sulfide,
and phosphate. Surface layer thickness >1 μm.

100Cr6/DLC; EPND-02/06: Only little increase of oxygen
∼1 at % (99% C–C and 1 at % C=O bonds) on the
surface, whereas the bulk material is reached after 20 nm.

100Cr6/DLC; Optigear32: Sulfide, molybdenum
sulfide,
and oxides (C=O, O–C, O–Me) measured from the
surface to a depth of 50 nm.

100Cr6/Si-DLC;
EPND-02/06: Surface near increase of
oxygen ∼10 at % (C–C, C–Si, O–Si, O–C)
after 20 nm bulk material with constant oxygen content.

100Cr6/Si-DLC; Optigear32: Surface near higher oxygen
content ∼10 at % (O–Me, C–Si, O–C–Si,
Si–O) after 10 nm bulk material.

DLC/DLC; EPND-02/06: DLC coating is damaged after tribotest;
therefore, there is nearly the same amount of oxygen (34 at %), carbon
(31.9 at %), and iron (14 at %) on the surface as after the 100Cr6/100Cr6
test but with a higher content of chromium (13 at %). Tribological
boundary layer >50 nm (assumed to be in the range of 1 μm
as
for the 100Cr6/100Cr6 tribotest, but it was only measured to 50 nm).

DLC/DLC; Optigear32: DLC coating damaged;
therefore,
phosphor, sulfur, and molybdenum were detected on the steel surface
with high oxygen content (47 at %) content. Tribological-influenced
surface layer is also thicker than 50 nm (assumed to be in the range
of 1 μm as for 100Cr6/100Cr6 tribotest, but it was only measured
to 50 nm).

Molecular Dynamic Simulations
Ordering of the formanisotropic
molecules under shear was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations.
EPND-02/06 molecules were modeled by a Gay-Berne potential32 (GB, an asymmetric Lennard-Jones potential)
that describes the dispersive interactions between the approximately
cigar-shaped molecules. Simulations were conducted at three different
initial molecule orientations (Figure 6a, the GB particles are represented by rigid ellipsoids).
In the EtE orientation (end to end) shear is applied parallel to the
ordered layers (Figure 6b). The FtF∥ (face to face, parallel) system is
sheared parallel to the long half axes of the molecules, whereby at
FtF⊥ (face to face, perpendicular) orientation shear
is induced perpendicular to the long axes of the half-GB particles.
The GB fluid (2304 GB particles) was confined between two solids with
1 GPa perpendicular pressure at a temperature of 360 K. We found that
shear bands are building up in the EtE orientation at shear rates
higher than γ̇ = 106.9 s–1 (Figure 6b).

Figure 6 Formation of triboactive
layers. Molecular dynamic simulations:
(a) Three different initial molecule orientations before sliding.
The EPND-02/06 is represented by Gay–Berne particles (2304
GB particles in white). Two rigid walls are shown by violet GB particles,
while thermalization of the system is established with velocity scaling
of the green GB particles. (b) Configuration of molecules at the end
of the shear simulation. Sliding is initiated by moving the top violet
layer with constant velocity (shear rates γ̇ > 106.9 L/s). All particles with bold solid green edges were initially
on a straight vertical line. These particles serve as markers to visualize
the strain accommodation mode. Shearing of the EtE-oriented molecule
leads to an alignment according to thin-film lubrication theory by
Zhang:26 (1) adsorbed film, (2) ordered
film, (3) fluid film. (c) Calculated decrease in viscosity η
with increasing shear rate γ̇ in the GB simulations at
the different starting orientations of the molecules.

The deformation occurs at a two-layer distance
from the surface
due to the strong end-to-end interaction of the GB particles from
the surface with those in the bulk. This effect is not found in the
FtF∥ configuration and only partly in FtF⊥. The orientation of the GB particles near the surface thus affects
the flow behavior of the whole liquid. Despite that the deformation
in the FtF∥ configuration is distributed over the
entire volume, a preferred flow in a single layer close to the moving
surface is still recognized (Figure 6b). This is in contrast to the EtE orientation, where
shearing leads to the formation of a completely rearranged block in
the center of the bulk. The resulting configuration is similar to
the thin-film lubrication model given by Zhang (see Figure 5 there).26 There is an adsorbed film (1) on the surface
followed by an ordered film (2) and a fluid film in the bulk (3) of
the friction gap. These different alignments influence the resulting
shear stress and therefore also affect the COF. It must be noticed
that the viscosity from the simulation cannot be used as absolute
values since only GB particles which are represented by rigid ellipsoids
were simulated. The smallest shear stress and lowest relative viscosity
are found in the EtE configuration due to the relative movement of
separated blocks (Figure 6c). The deformation in the entire volume of FtF∥ configuration results in the highest viscosity. In addition, the
alignment of the GB particles is connected with a pronounced shear
thinning.

Discussion
Our studies show that
the friction and wear behavior of the mesogenic
fluid EPND-02/06 depends on the used material combination. In contrast
to Optigear32, superlow friction can be realized. It was found that
the surface energy in combination with the polarity of the lubricants
is a key factor to influence the spreading parameter and therefore
the surface tribochemical characteristics (Figure 7a). DLC has lower surface energy and polarity
than the Si-DLC coating which leads to a negative spreading parameter
(SP). This means that the work of adhesion on the solid–oil
interface is smaller than the cohesion work between molecules within
the oils. In addition, since the work of adhesion describes the strength
of the contact between two phases it is assumed that these interfacial
parameters influence the tribological performance. In the case of
static friction the work of adhesion between the solid friction pairs
must be overcome. As shown in Figure 7b for EPND-02/06 static friction increases with higher
work of adhesion. In contrast, no correlation is observed with Optigear32.
It is assumed that this is due to the chemical interactions of the
additives. During dynamic friction high adhesion between solid and
liquid is necessary to form a stable lubricant film. The results show
this correlation between work of adhesion and the friction work (Figure 7c). The same tendency
is also found in the case of spreading parameter as with higher spreading
parameter the adhesion between lubricant and solid increases. Guo
et al.28 found that higher contact angle
hysteresis (CAH) correlates with increased film thickness under hydrodynamic
lubrication. According to these findings we measured higher friction
work at increasing CAH for EPND-02/06 (Figure 7d). With respect to thin-film lubrication
theory this behavior could be attributed to the higher molecular ordering
at higher shear stress under lower film thickness. Using Optigear32
nearly the same friction work and CAH were found with all tested material
combinations.

m s–1.

The friction coefficient of lubricated contacts is generally
affected
by hydrodynamic lubrication. Right from the start of the experiment
there is wear of the ball and the plates which causes growth of the
contact area. Different wear rates therefore result in slightly different
contact pressures. In larger contact areas with lower contact pressures,
the hydrodynamic lubrication normally is improved. Nevertheless, as
shown in Figure 7e
much lower friction work (and also coefficient of friction) can be
realized using EPND-02/06 at the same or even lower resulting contact
pressures as with Optigear32. This implies that the low friction is
not only caused by hydrodynamic effects but also by surface chemical
interactions. The same correlation is found by comparing the total
amount of wear and the friction work (Figure 7f).

The analyses after friction tests
of mesogenic fluid and worn surface
imply that chemical interactions play a key role to realize superlow
friction. The measured increase of microhardness using EPND-02/06
on a worn area after the friction test is not caused by formation
of additional sp3 sites on the surface as measured using
Raman spectroscopy. We suggest that this property change could arise
due to a top layer densification as proposed from Manimunda et al.23 The formation of a chelate complex, as described
in previous work, was observed for all material combinations as the
friction tests were carried out in an iron sample holder in which
only the top-coated plates were fully immersed in EPND-02/06. XPS
analyses showed that the chemical composition and also thickness of
tribologically formed surface layers differ in relation to material
pairing and lubrication. Using EPND-02/06 a thin appr. 20 nm thick
surface layer with a small amount of C=O bonds (∼1%)
on the surface is formed using DLC and Si-DLC coatings. In contrast,
the wear track on 100Cr6 shows a surface layer with a thickness of
∼600 nm (C–H, O–Me, O–C, Fe-oxide, Cr-oxide,
carbides). With Optigear32, deposits of the additives (phosphate,
sulfur, molybdenum) are detected on 100Cr6 and DLC but not on the
Si-DLC surface. Therefore, we assumed that the chemical interactions
and in particular the adsorption of mesogenic fluid on the surface
play a major role in realizing superlow friction. As this interaction
is less pronounced with DLC, a DLC self-pairing tribosystem shows
worse tribological behavior than a hybrid pairing of DLC and 100Cr6.

The simulated molecular formation under shear according to the
thin-film lubrication theory ((1) adsorbed film, (2) ordered film,
(3) fluid film) accompanied by viscosity decrease at high shear rates
gives further evidence that both the interaction with the surface
and the molecular ordering generate superlow friction.

Conclusions
The hypothesis of this work was based on the thin-film lubrication
theory (TFL), which describes the molecular state at which the minimal
friction is reached in the tribological system. Since the TFL lubrication
regime is achieved by the interaction of the surface with the lubricant
molecules (adsorbed layer) combined with a specific orientation (anisotropic
viscosity) between these layers in a very small frictional gap (appr.
10–100 nm), the aim of this investigation was to investigate
the tribological behavior of a formanisotropic 1,3-diketone (EPND-02/06).
Therefore, steel 100Cr6, a-C:H and Si-doped a-C:H samples were tested
using a rotating ball-on-3-plates tribometer. These findings were
correlated with interfacial parameters of the materials. Superlow
friction values were observed using the 1,3-diketone according to
the specific material combination due to the chemical interaction
of fluid and the sample. In contrast to a-C:H-coating, which achieved
superlow friction in combination with steel, a-C:H self-pairing caused
higher wear (damage of coating) and friction. In addition, the wear
volume was clearly reduced using a-C:H-coated plates compared to uncoated
steel surfaces. The most important findings of this study were:It was demonstrated that superlow
friction is only reached
in the presence of iron, which tribochemically forms a metal chelate
complex. Therefore, the use of a hard coating in combination with
steel leads to the most favorable result, i.e., low friction (−80%
friction work compared to Optigear32) and lower wear as with 100Cr6
self-pairing.

Interfacial parameters
as work of adhesion, spreading
parameter, and contact angle hysteresis show good correlation with
tribological results.

DLC- and SI-DLC
coating shows change in microhardness
after friction test but which is not caused by the formation of sp3 sites.

Molecular dynamic simulations
at high shear rates showed
that the orientation of the molecules in the friction gap strongly
affects the viscosity and therefore the coefficient of friction. As
described in the thin-film lubrication theory it is demonstrated that
the 1,3-diketone molecules form an ordered layer consisting of three
regions: adsorbed film, ordered film, and fluid film.
