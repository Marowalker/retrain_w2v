During olive oil extraction, large
amounts of phenolics are generated
in the corresponding wastewaters (up to 10 g dm–3). This makes olive oil mill wastewater toxic and conventional biological
treatment challenging. The catalytic wet peroxide oxidation process
can reduce toxicity without significant energy consumption. Hydrogen
peroxide oxidation of phenolics present in industrial wastewaters
was studied in this work over copper catalysts focusing on understanding
the impact of mass transfer and establishing the reaction kinetics.
A range of physicochemical methods were used for catalyst characterization.
The optimal reaction conditions were identified as 353 K and atmospheric
pressure, giving complete conversion of total phenols and over 50%
conversion of total organic carbon content. Influence of mass transfer
on the observed reaction rate and kinetics was investigated, and parameters
of the advanced kinetic model and activation energies for hydrogen
peroxide decomposition and polyphenol oxidation were estimated.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Phenols
are important industrial chemicals widely used as reactants
and solvents in numerous commercial processes and therefore are often
present in industrial effluents. The major anthropogenic sources of
phenol-contaminated wastewaters are petrochemical, pharmaceutical,
wood, pulp, and paper and food processing industries as well as landfill
and agricultural area leachate waters.1 There are several environmental concerns regarding phenols; thus,
they are considered to be hazardous in industrial wastewaters, harmful
even at low concentration levels (ppm range). Wastewaters containing
phenols should therefore undergo a special treatment. In EU, the current
limits for wastewater emission of phenols are 0.5 mg dm–3 (0.5 ppm) for surface waters and 1 mg dm–3 (1
ppm) for sewage systems with maximum allowed concentration levels
in potable and mineral waters of 0.5 μg dm–3 (0.5 ppb).

Significant quantities of phenolics are generated
in olive oil
mill wastewater (OOMW) including organic contaminants such as lignin,
tannins, and polyphenolic compounds. Significant amounts of olive
mill wastewater exceeding several million tons are produced in Europe
alone despite stringent legislation2 and
are not properly treated. The properties of OOMWs depend on the method
of extraction, feedstock properties, and region and climate conditions.
In general, OOMW is a dark brown acidic effluent (pH = 4.0–5.5),
with a distinctive odor and high conductivity, comprising besides
water (80–83%) organic compounds (15–18%) and inorganic
elements (2%, potassium salts and phosphates). The concentration of
phenols and polyphenols in OOMW can be as high as 20 wt %.3 Although several studies were reported on removal
of phenolics in OOMW,4 significant efforts
are still needed. Often separation-based technologies are suggested
as an alternative to biological processes, however, their effective
application can be hindered by high operational costs and sustainability
concerns such as generation of secondary toxic wastes because the
toxic compounds are not destroyed but only separated.5 Therefore, in the current work, the focus was on catalytic
approaches to diminish the content of phenolics in OOMW.

In
particular, the catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) process
is a suitable method6 generating hydroxyl
radicals during hydrogen peroxide decomposition. Hydrogen peroxide
is generally considered as a nontoxic and ecologically attractive
oxidant. Application of heterogeneous catalysts, such as zeolites,7 in CWPO of organic compounds has been reported.
Transition metal-exchanged (mostly iron and copper) zeolites of FAU
or MFI morphology showed promising results; however, there are still
some open issues such as resistance to leaching of the active metal
during the reaction. Apart from few recent reports,8−11 most of the studies describe
application of powdered catalysts for which mass transfer limitations
can be neglected.7,12,13 It is apparently clear that scaling up of a commercial CWPO process
requires detailed studies with the pelletized catalysts. In this case,
external and internal mass transfers (i.e., diffusion processes in
the boundary layer surrounding the catalyst pellet and in the pores
of the catalyst) should be properly considered.

In this work,
the activity of copper-containing catalysts was tested
in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of OOMW with a special attention
to the stability of copper during the reaction, namely, its resistance
to leaching. The influence of interparticle and intraparticle diffusion
was investigated, and the reaction kinetics parameters of the proposed
pseudo-second-order kinetic model were estimated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
A series of
copper-containing 13X zeolite catalysts were prepared by postsynthesis
ion-exchange from the sodium form of the commercial 13X zeolite acquired
from UOP Italy (13X-APG Molsiv, SiO2/Al2O3 = 3.2, wNa2O = 20
wt %, dB, range ≤ 2 mm).

Depending on the bead size, between 2.5 and 10 g dm–3 zeolite was ion-exchanged with a 0.05 M copper acetate solution
under agitation at 298 K for 0.5 to 3 h, followed by filtration of
the samples and drying overnight at room temperature to obtain copper-bearing
zeolites with a similar metal content. The detailed preparation method
was described previously.14 After copper
ion-exchange, postsynthesis thermal treatment was performed consisting
of calcination at 1273 K for 5 h (ramp 2 K min–1) to achieve materials exhibiting a higher stability against the
loss of the active metal component during the reaction. The list of
prepared catalysts and their designated names is presented in Table 1.

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
Textural
characterization of the catalysts was performed by nitrogen physisorption
at 77 K using a Sorptomatic 1900 Carlo Erba instrument. Prior to measurements,
the samples were outgassed at 423 K for 3 h at reduced pressure below
0.1 mbar. The specific surface area and pore volume calculations were
performed using Dubinin’s equation for microporous and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
equation for mesoporous samples. Pore size distributions were acquired
using the Horvath–Kawazoe method.

The crystalline structures
of the parent zeolite- and prepared zeolite-based catalysts containing
copper were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis on
a XRD 600, Shimadzu instrument. Cu Kα was used as the radiation
source at the wavelength of 0.154 nm with 2θ from 5 to 60°
with a 0.02° step size. The peak identification was performed
using X’Pert HighScorePlus software.

The morphology of
the fresh- and spent-zeolite-based copper catalysts
Cu/13X and Cu/13X-K1273 was studied using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM analysis was
performed on carbon-coated samples using a LEO Gemini 1530 instrument
equipped with a Thermo Scientific UltraDry Silicon Drift Detector.
The transmission electron microphotographs were taken by a JEM-1400
Plus transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 120 kV acceleration
voltage. The powdered samples were suspended in 100% ethanol under
ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. For each sample, a drop of ethanol
suspension was deposited on a Cu fiber carbon grid (200 mesh) and
evaporated, after which the images were recorded.

Copper loading
was measured using a UV/vis spectrometer (UV1600PC,
Shimadzu) at 270 nm for the parent solution of copper acetate applied
during ion exchange and later confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray
microanalysis (EDXA) during SEM analysis and by inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) (PerkinElmer, Optima
5300 DV) after dissolution in HF.

The basicity of the prepared
catalysts was elucidated using temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of CO2 on AutoChem 2010 (Micromeritics
Instruments) in the temperature range of 373–1173 K according
to the method described by Kumar et al.15

Infrared spectroscopy (ATI Mattson FTIR) was applied to elucidate
the strength of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites using the KBr pellet
technique working in the range of wavenumbers of 4000–400 cm–1 with pyridine as the probe molecule. A detailed description
of the analytical procedure is available.16

2.3 Catalytic Experiments
The catalytic
experiments were carried out under atmospheric pressure in a 250 cm3 glass batch reactor equipped with a pH electrode and a temperature
sensor. The stirring speed in the range between 50 and 800 min–1 and catalyst particle sizes from ca. 0.3 to 2.0 mm
were varied to address the impact of mass transfer. For elucidation
of reaction kinetics, the catalyst loading, reaction temperature,
and hydrogen peroxide concentration were varied. OOMW was supplied
by a private oilery (Dalmatia Region, Croatia) from a three-phase
extraction process of olive oil production from green olive stock
mixture (local sort Olea europaea var. oblica). Basic properties of the wastewater are presented
in Table 2.

a Total phenols content constitutes
17 wt % total organic carbon (TOC) content of the OOMW.

Prior to reactions, OOMW was filtered
through a 100 μm nylon
filter bag and diluted with distilled water (v/v = 50:50). UV–vis
absorbance was applied to monitor the concentration of phenolics and
hydrogen peroxide. The standard Folin–Ciocalteu method at 765
nm described in the literature17 was used
to measure the total phenol concentration. A standard curve of gallic
acid was used for quantification, and the results were expressed as
gallic acid equivalent (GAE) concentrations. The ammonium metavanadate
spectrophotometric method at 450 nm adopted from ref (18) was used for measuring
hydrogen peroxide concentrations. The measured absorbances were recalibrated
with reference to OOMW sample blanks not containing phenols or hydrogen
peroxide to eliminate the potential error from the existing color
or turbidity of the wastewater. Total organic carbon (TOC) was evaluated
with a TOC-V CSN Shimadzu analyzer using diluted reaction mixtures,
and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the selected samples was measured
by a UV/vis spectrometer using the dichromate colorimetric method
at 605 nm (Hach-Lange cuvette tests). The copper content in the reaction
mixture reflecting metal leaching was determined by atomic absorption
spectrometry of diluted reaction mixture solutions on Shimadzu AAS
6300 using a Cu hollow cathode at λ = 324.9 nm. X-ray powder
diffraction analysis and N2 physisorption measurements
were conducted to reveal potential structural changes and coking.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalyst
Characterization
After testing
all prepared catalysts having different sizes, it was concluded (see
below) that Cu/13X-1 with the size range of 0.4–0.63 mm is
the most appropriate for CWAO. Table 3 thus contains results obtained from N2 physisorption
analysis of Cu/13X-1 and its thermally treated counterpart. The incorporation
of copper in 13X zeolite did not have a significant effect on the
measured surface area.

b Calculation based on a 25% reduction

The thermal treatment resulted
in a decrease of both specific surface
area and pore volume with a shift of the pore size distributions (Figure 1) from the microporous
(Cu/13X-1) to the mesoporous range (Cu/13X-K1273-1). Such pronounced
differences in the physical properties for the catalyst calcined at
1273 K can be attributed to structural changes during thermal treatment.

Figure 1 Pore size
distributions in Cu/13X-1 and Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalysts.

XRD diffractograms of Cu/13X-1 already presented
in ref (19) confirm
the FAU structure
as no shifts in the peak positions and no significant diffraction
lines assigned to any new or impurity phase were observed.

XRD
suggested19 high crystallinity of
the copper-containing material as incorporation of copper into the
zeolite framework via ion exchange does not influence the crystal
structure. In agreement with the literature,20 the obtained results indicate that Cu2+ ions are well
dispersed in the zeolite framework of 13X and that the size of copper
particles is below the detection limit for the XRD measurement (<2–4
nm). In fact, from the TEM image of a Cu/13X-1 catalyst (Figure 2a), very small metal
particles highly dispersed in single zeolite crystals can be observed.
Their average size calculated using TEM analysis was 1.7 nm.

Figure 2 TEM images
of Cu/13X-1 (a) and Cu/13X-K1273-1 (b) catalysts.

The copper-bearing zeolite calcined at 1273 K exhibited phase
transformations
from a zeolite to a silicate-based material upon heating. As previously
reported,19 several phases were determined
for Cu/13X-K1273-1, including magnesium silicate, copper oxide, anorthoclase
(Na0.85K0.14AlSi3O8),
and andesine (Na0.685Ca0.347Al1.46Si2.54O8). Changes in crystal phases upon thermal
treatment were in line with a decrease of the surface area and pore
volume (Table 3). The
size of CuO in Cu/13X-K1273-1 according to the Debye–Scherrer
equation was 26.0 and 25.1 nm for the respective peaks at 35.5 and
38.6°. An average metal particle size analysis using TEM was
not applicable for the Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst because of a poor resolution
between the dark metal particles and the dark surface of single catalyst
crystals (Figure 2b).
The increase in the size of the metal particles in the Cu/13X-K1273-1
catalyst is most probably a consequence of metal sintering and clustering
of smaller metal particles into larger ones that occurs during thermal
treatment.21

The morphology, shape,
and size of crystals of Cu/13X-1 and Cu/13X-K1273-1
catalysts were additionally characterized by SEM. From the transmission
electron micrograph (Figure 2a) and the scanning electron micrograph (Figure 3a) of the Cu/13X-1 catalyst,
specific needle-shaped crystals were identified.

Figure 3 SEM images of Cu/13X-1
(a) and Cu/13X-K1273-1 (b) catalysts.

Although agglomerated, these can be associated with X zeolite
morphology
similar to that reported previously.22 Single
crystals in Cu/13X-K1273-1 were observed to be larger in size and
of irregular shapes and a broad crystal size range (Figures 2b and 3b) in agreement with XRD, showing the presence of several crystal
phases.

To evaluate metal dispersion across the surface, SEM
imaging in
a backscattering mode of the pellets and the cross sections of pellets
was performed (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Backscattering SEM images of pellets and cross sections of pellets:
Cu/13X-1 (a, b) Cu/13X-K1273-1 (c, d).

The brighter areas in the backscattering images are representative
of the higher densities of the more heavy elements (copper). It can
be noticed that copper is consistently spread over the surface of
the Cu/13X-1 catalyst (Figure 4a,b), whereas in the case of the Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst (Figure 4c,d), copper is mainly
located on the outer catalyst surface and in the narrow band close
to the pellet surface several micrometers in width. Migration of copper
from inside of the pellet to its outer surface is most probably a
consequence of the structural changes during thermal postsynthesis
treatment.

XPS analysis was used for the identification of the
oxidation state
of copper cations in Cu/13X-1 and Cu/13X-K1273-1. From the XPS spectra
presented in Figure 5, characteristic peaks were identified for Cu 2p, O 1s, Al 2p, and
Si 2p for both catalysts. Differences in the high-resolution spectra
of Cu 2p and O 1s indicate that the nature of copper species is different
in Cu/13X-1 and thermally treated Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalysts. The first
exhibits only two main peaks at 934 (Cu 2p3/2) and 953.3
eV (Cu 2p1/2), confirming the presence of Cu1+ as in Cu2O. In the high-resolution Cu 2p spectra of the
latter, strong Cu2+ satellite peaks at 943.3 and 964.2
eV were present, contributing to the presence of the CuO phase, as
previously identified by XRD.23 Differences
in O 1s signals additionally confirm the distinction between copper
oxides found on the surface of Cu/13X-1 and Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalysts.
It should be noted that reduction of finely dispersed Cu2+ under exposure to the X-ray beam during XPS analysis in the case
of the Cu/13X-1 catalyst cannot be excluded. Therefore, a difference
between the catalysts can also be related to difficulties in reduction
of larger CuO particles in the case of Cu/13X-K1273-1 during the XPS
measurements.

and Cu/13X-K1273-1

During catalyst preparation, the
influence of metal incorporation
into the zeolite support as well as the influence of postsynthesis
thermal treatment on the acid–base properties of the parent
and copper-bearing zeolites has been investigated. CO2-TPD
profiles of the parent zeolite as such (13X), calcined form (13X-K1273),
copper zeolite (Cu/13X-1), and the calcined material (Cu/13X-K1273-1)
were presented previously.19 The calculated
amounts of desorbed CO2 are given in Table 4.

Weak, medium, and strong basic sites were
identified in 13X and
copper-modified 13X zeolites,19 which is
explained by the application of the sodium form of the commercial
zeolite for catalyst preparation as well as with the intrinsic (structural)
basicity of oxygen atoms present in the zeolite.24

Copper-containing zeolite Cu13X-1 exhibited much
higher quantities
of desorbed CO2 related to strong basic sites (>750
K),
indicating a more pronounced basicity of copper-exchanged zeolite.
High temperature, however, can in general also lead to structural
changes of the zeolite, thus preventing a straightforward assignment
of high-temperature peaks to strong basic sites. This possibility
was ruled out because only strong basic sites were seen for thermally
stable Cu/13X-K1273-1.

Acidity measurements were reported previously19 showing that copper-containing catalysts exhibited
Lewis
acidity, which can be explained by the presence of copper.2

Thermal treatment of Cu/13X-1 resulted
in a decrease in acidity.
Brønsted acid sites are degraded upon severe heat treatment above
773 K,24 whereas Lewis acidity from Cu2+ present in Cu/13X was diminished by the formation of copper
oxide, showing a more basic character. As reported previously,19 higher acidity was measured for Cu/13X-K1273-1
compared to that for the copper-free counterpart.

3.2 Preliminary Catalytic Experiments and Analysis
of Internal Mass Transfer
Catalytic wet peroxide oxidation
of OOMW was performed under mild reaction conditions. During preliminary
studies, the extent of thermal decomposition of polyphenols present
in the OOMW was investigated as well as the influence of catalyst
addition on the reactant conversion rates. The possible catalytic
activity of the parent Na-13X zeolite in the CWPO of phenol was excluded
during our previous investigations of a model catalytic system.14

Preliminary results on catalytic oxidation
were already reported,19 confirming the
role of catalysts in reducing the amount of phenolics and decomposing
hydrogen peroxide (Figure 6a,b). Thermal treatment of the catalyst at high temperature
was effective in decreasing hydrogen peroxide decomposition, improving
also the conversion of total phenols.

Figure 6 Kinetic curves for hydrogen peroxide (a)
and total phenols (b)
(cHP,0 = 0.25 M, T =
353 K, N = 600 min–1, mCAT = 2.5 g, dB = 0.4–0.63
mm).

These results indicate that the
oxidant is probably inefficiently
used in the reaction on Cu/13X-1 and that hydrogen peroxide is mainly
consumed in the reactions where hydroxyl radicals are lost and are
not used for degradation of the polyphenols. In CWPO, oxidation of
organic compounds is attributed to the presence of hydroxyl radicals
that are generated when hydrogen peroxide is decomposed. Reaction
pathways can be presented with Reactions 1–6. In the initial stages
of the reaction, hydroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals are produced by
hydrogen peroxide decomposition on the catalyst25 1   2  Both radical species are capable
of oxidizing
the organic compounds; however, the reactivity of hydroxyl radicals
is dominant.7 Catalytically produced hydroxyl
radicals react with phenolic compounds, oxidizing them through a series
of intermediates to carbon dioxide and water when complete mineralization
is achieved 3  Hydroxyl radicals are very reactive, and they
are involved in a number of competing side reactions such as scavenging
hydrogen peroxide and termination between the hydroxyl and perhydroxyl
radicals7 4   5   6  If the latter reactions
of hydroxyl radicals
are dominant, hydrogen peroxide will be consumed fast and majority
of the generated hydroxyl radicals will be spent inefficiently in
undesired side reactions. This could be considered a preferred reaction
pathway if the intraparticle diffusion resistances for the phenolic
molecules are present. In this case, only hydrogen peroxide would
be adsorbed and decomposed on the catalytically active sites on the
internal catalyst surface, whereas adsorption of polyphenols would
be limited mostly to the outer surface of the catalyst. In the absence
of organic compounds, the hydroxyl radicals formed inside the catalyst
would for the most part react with one another and hydrogen peroxide.
Taking into account the average pore sizes in the Cu/13X-1 catalyst
(2 nm) and cross sections of hydrogen peroxide (0.15 nm) and polyphenols
(1–2 nm), configurational diffusion limitations could be expected
for the phenolic compounds found in the OOMW. In addition to configurational
limitations, intraparticle resistances for hydrogen peroxide and polyphenols
could be present. They were verified using the Weisz–Prater
criterion26 7  where robs is
the observed reaction rate, R is the particle radius, cs is the molar concentration of the solute at
the catalyst surface, De is the effective
diffusion coefficient of the solute, and n is the
reaction order. For the porous media and the random pore model, the
effective diffusion coefficient is defined as , where D is the diffusion
coefficient, ε is the porosity, and τ is the tortuosity,
which are connected to the structural characteristics of the catalyst
and pore geometry. For the liquid–solid catalytic systems,
only molecular diffusion was taken into account, D ≈ DABo. The molecular diffusion coefficient was calculated
from the Wilke–Chang equation27 8  where Φ is the dimensionless association
factor of the solvent (Φ = 2.6 for water), MB is the molar mass of the solvent, μB is the dynamic viscosity of the solvent in cP at temperature T (K), and Vb(A)0.6 is the liquid molar
volume at the solute normal boiling point. For the purposes of this
study, the liquid molar volumes at the solute’s normal boiling
point were calculated from the Tyn and Calus equation 9  The calculations of the diffusion coefficients
were performed for hydrogen peroxide and phenol diffusing in water
using the data and expressions obtained from the thermodynamic properties
databank.28 In the absence of thermodynamic
data at the critical point for polyphenols such as hydroxytyrosol
or tyrosol that are most commonly found in the OOMW, phenol was chosen
as a model compound for the calculations. Because polyphenols are
more complex and larger molecules than phenol, it is reasonable to
expect that if the internal transfer limitations exist for phenol
they would be even more pronounced for polyphenols. The obtained values
of the diffusion coefficients at 353 K and normal pressure (typical
reaction conditions) were 6.0 × 10–9 m2 s–1 for hydrogen peroxide and 3.5 ×
10–9 m2 s–1 for phenol.
Application of the Weisz–Prater criterion (eq 7) for the observed initial reaction
rates of hydrogen peroxide decomposition (rHP,obs = 3.7 × 10–4 mol dm–3 s–1) and polyphenols oxidation (rTPh,obs = 5.3 × 10–5 mol dm–3 s–1) and their corresponding surface concentrations
with the mean catalyst particle diameter of 0.515 mm and  ratio of 0.1 (generally valid
for zeolites)
resulted in the values of the dimensionless Weisz modulus of 0.15
for hydrogen peroxide diffusion and 2.25 for phenol. With this result,
the presence of intraparticle diffusion for hydrogen peroxide can
be eliminated, whereas the same cannot be concluded for the phenolics,
especially for the reaction orders higher than zero. For polyphenols
in OOMW, larger pore diffusion limitations can be expected being the
most probable cause of an inefficient use of hydrogen peroxide. Because
there are no pore diffusion limitations for the oxidant, hydrogen
peroxide mainly decomposes inefficiently inside the Cu/13X-1 catalyst
pores where negligible amounts of polyphenols are present.

On
the other hand, because of the larger pore sizes of the calcined
Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst (average pore size of 5 nm), the internal
diffusion in this reaction should not be as significant as in the
case of the Cu/13X-1 catalyst and faster decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide and oxidation of polyphenols should be expected. However,
this is not the case. The reason for a much slower radical generation
rate lies in the fact that the postsynthesis thermal treatment induced
migration of the catalytically active species (copper) toward the
pellet surface, which was confirmed by SEM imaging in the backscattering
mode of the cross sections of Cu/13X-1 and Cu/13X-K1273-1 pellets,
as presented in Figure 5b,d. Hydrogen peroxide decomposition in the Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst
takes place only in a narrow ring of few micrometers from the particle
surface where the presence of copper is identified and where polyphenols
are also present. In this case, it can be considered that the pore
diffusion for polyphenols is not as significant as in the case of
the Cu/13X-1 catalyst and that most of the generated hydroxyl radicals
are reacting with the organic compounds and are not inefficiently
spent in fast scavenging reactions inside the catalyst pellet (eqs 4–6). As a result, the rates of polyphenol oxidation are comparable
for both catalysts with a higher extent of oxidation for Cu/13X-K1273-1
resulting in an almost complete removal of the phenolic content after
180 min of reaction.

Comparison of Cu/13X and Cu/13X-K1273 during
preliminary studies
included also the investigation of their behavior in CWPO of OOMW,
namely, measuring the extent of copper leaching during the reaction
as well as by analyzing potential changes of the zeolite support after
the reaction. XRD diffractograms of both catalysts prior and after
catalytic experiments are close to each other (Figure 7a,b), indicating good stability of the support,
while copper leaching was
significantly different.

Figure 7 XRD diffractograms of the fresh and spent Cu/13X-1
(a) and Cu/13X-K1273-1
(b) catalysts.

By measuring the copper
content in diluted reaction mixtures using
atomic absorption spectroscopy, it was determined that after 180 min
38 wt % copper leached from the Cu/13X-1 catalyst in a striking contrast
to only 2 wt % for its counterpart calcined at high temperature, indicating
severe instability of Cu/13X-1. Contribution of the leached copper
in the solution to the overall catalytic performance was discussed
previously,29,30 concluding that it can be neglected
due to inactivation of copper by carboxylic acids. However, in this
case, when over 20% of copper leached from the catalyst before the
reaction was initiated by addition of hydrogen peroxide, the homogeneous
contribution should not be excluded because oxidation of organic compounds
catalyzed by copper cations in the liquid phase is possible. The copper
leaching results were confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
analysis of the fresh and spent catalysts, showing 42 wt % loss of
copper for the spent Cu/13X-1 catalyst and 4 wt % loss of copper for
the Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst. Specific surface area measurements were
also supporting the superior resistance against leaching of the thermally
treated catalyst.

For the Cu/13X-1 catalyst, the specific surface
area and pore volume
decreased from the initial SFRESH = 618
m2 g–1 and Vp,FRESH = 0.34 cm3 g–1 to SSPENT = 434 m2 g–1 and Vp,SPENT = 0.30 cm3 g–1, respectively, whereas the values for the Cu13X-K1273-1 catalyst
did not significantly change before and after the reaction: SFRESH = 26 m2 g–1 and Vp,FRESH = 0.03 cm3 g–1 to SSPENT = 24 m2 g–1 and Vp,SPENT = 0.04 cm3 g–1, respectively.

One of the possible explanations for large variations in stability
between calcined and noncalcined catalysts could be the different
copper speciation, namely, the presence of Cu+ in Cu/13X-1
as revealed by XPS. To our knowledge, no report on the differences
in the stability of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the CWPO
of phenolics has been published. However, different coordination of
copper inside the zeolite lattice for Cu+ and Cu2+ cations was reported by Vanelderen et al.,31 which could have an impact on their catalytic properties as well.

An alternative explanation was proposed by Taran et al. based on
a study of Cu-ZSM-5.13 The authors have
shown that copper catalysts with 1–2 wt % loading possessed
the highest activity and reasonable stability, whereas an increase
in copper resulted in a lower activity and stability. In the current
work, for the noncalcined catalysts, the amount of Cu could have been
too high to allow formation of a stable material. After calcination,
the zeolitic structure has been destroyed, giving several new phases.
It could be due to the fact that partial encapsulation of CuO particles
makes the catalyst less prone to leaching.

Whatever the explanation,
elucidation of mass transfer influence
and kinetic analysis was done for the Cu/13X-K1273 catalyst in which
the more efficient use of the oxidant was proven to take place.

3.3 Mixing Efficiency and External Mass Transfer
In the case of catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of polyphenols
over a solid pelleted catalyst, following mass transfer processes
should be considered: transport of the dissolved reactants from the
liquid bulk to the catalyst outer surface and transport inside the
pores of the pellet. These effects result in the concentration gradients
of reactants and products across phase boundaries and within the catalyst
particle, as present in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Mass transfer in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation of polyphenols
in OOMW.

To evaluate all possible mass
transfer limitations, a combined
theoretical/experimental approach was adopted in this study. Mass
transfer coefficients through the external boundary layer and inside
the pores were calculated for hydrogen peroxide and model compound
phenol, and the presence of diffusion limitations was evaluated by
the application of external mass transport and internal pore diffusion
criteria for the Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst. Additionally, the efficiency
of mixing in the reactor was verified and evaluation of reaction conditions
for achieving total suspension of the catalyst was performed.

External mass transfer or the mass transfer in the thin boundary
layer around the solid catalyst particle depends on hydrodynamic conditions
in the reactor (stirring speed), physical properties of the liquids,
and the size of the catalyst particles. In the catalytic reactions
in which the suspended solid catalyst is used, external mass transfer
resistances can be minimized by efficient mixing that establishes
thorough dispersion of reactants and catalyst in the liquid and the
use of the smaller catalyst particles. The first step in achieving
this is ensuring that under the conditions of the catalytic experiments
the solid catalyst is completely suspended in the liquid and no particles
remain at the bottom of the reactor for longer than 1 s. The minimum
stirrer speed necessary for total suspension can be calculated from
the empirical Zweitering equation32 10  where g is the
gravitational
constant (cm s–2), dP is the particle diameter (cm), dM is
the impeller diameter (cm), ρL and νL are the density and kinematic viscosity of water in g cm–3 and cm2 s–1, respectively, B is the percentage of the weight of the catalyst compared
to the weight of the liquid, and Δρ = ρS – ρL. S is a dimensionless
factor that depends on the reactor geometry and impeller type, , and is equal to 3.3 for the stirred baffled
tank with a diameter of 6.5 cm and pitched four-blade turbine impeller
4.5 cm wide positioned at 2.5 cm from the bottom of the reactor.33 For achieving the total suspension of the Cu/13X-K1273-1
catalyst (ρS = 1.3 g cm–3, dP = 0.04 cm, B = 1%) in OOMW
(approximated by water: ρL = 0.997 and νL = 0.009 cm2 s–1), the rotational
speed of the stirrer should be minimum, 244 rpm.

The absence
of external mass transfer for the stirring speed of
600 rpm was verified by applying the external mass transport criterion
that can be derived considering the mass transfer rate through the
boundary layer of the catalyst particle equal to the observed reaction
rate34 11  Assuming Cb – Cs < 0.05cb and
the nth-order reaction, the criterion takes the form 12  where robs is
the observed reaction rate, R is the particle radius, cb is the molar concentration of the solute in
bulk, and kLS is the liquid/solid mass
transfer coefficient. Liquid/solid mass transfer coefficients for
hydrogen peroxide and phenol were calculated on the basis of the correlation
between dimensionless Sherwood, Reynolds, and Schmidt numbers for
slurry reactors34 13  where Re number is expressed
as  based on the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence.
By rearranging eq 13, the following expression for estimating liquid/solid mass transfer
coefficient kLS can be derived 14  In eq 14, ϵ denotes the energy of dissipation, D is the diffusion coefficient of the diffusing compound, dM is the impeller diameter, ρ and η
are the density and dynamic viscosity of water, and dP is the particle diameter. The energy of dissipation
or the maximum specific mixing power was calculated from 15  where P is the mixing power
that depends on the impeller type and stirring speed, NP is the power number of the impeller, and ρL and VL are the density and volume
of the liquid. For a 45° pitched four-blade turbine impeller
4.5 cm wide with NP = 1.3 in the turbulent
region (Re > 103) at a stirring speed
of 600 rpm mixing the volume of 250 cm3, the maximum specific
mixing power was calculated to be 0.96 W kg–1. The
mutual diffusion coefficients of solutes in water were calculated
using the Wilke–Chang equation (eq 8), resulting in the values of 6.0 × 10–9 m2 s–1 for hydrogen
peroxide and 3.5 × 10–9 m2 s–1 for phenol. Next, the external mass transfer coefficients
for hydrogen peroxide and phenol were calculated from eq 14, resulting in kLS,HP = 5.6 × 10–4 m s–1 and kLS,Ph = 3.8 × 10–4 m s–1. The application of the external mass transfer
criteria (eq 12) gave
the values on the left side of the equation several orders of magnitude
lower than those on the right side, showing that external mass transfer
for both hydrogen peroxide and polyphenols is negligible even at the
higher reaction orders and that the reaction mixture is effectively
mixed at 600 rpm.

The above theoretical approach results were
experimentally verified
by adopting the published procedures for the elimination of external
mass transfer.35 To confirm the specific
conditions under which the reaction was operating with negligible
external mass transfer resistances, the influence of the stirring
speed and particle size on the reaction rates of hydrogen peroxide
decomposition and polyphenols oxidation was investigated. The results
are presented in Figures 9, 10, and S1. From the results presented in Figure 9, it can be seen that already above 100 rpm
there are no significant changes in the reaction rates of hydrogen
peroxide decomposition and polyphenols oxidation and that the increase
in the stirring speed above 600 rpm does not further increase them.
This indicates that for the stirring speed above 600 rpm the external
mass transfer resistances are minimized and that the mass transfer
through the boundary layer proceeds faster that the surface reaction.

Figure 9 Influence
of the stirring speed on hydrogen peroxide (a) and total
phenol (b) content with time (N = 50–800 min–1, cHP,0 = 0.25 M, T = 353 K, mCu/13X-K1273-1 = 2.5 g, dB = 0.4–0.63 mm).

Figure 10 Influence of catalyst bead size on hydrogen
peroxide (a) and total
phenol (b) content with time (N = 600 min–1, cHP,0 = 0.5 M, T =
353 K, mCu/13X-K1273 = 2.5 g, dB = 0.315–2.00 mm).

From the above-presented results, it can be concluded that
the
reaction mixture is most effectively mixed at the stirrer speed of
600 rpm and that decreasing the particle size below 0.8 mm resulted
in only a slight improvement in the observed rate of phenol oxidation
excluding the presence of external mass transfer limitations that
could influence the reaction kinetics.

3.4 Influence
of Catalyst Loading, Initial Concentration
of Hydrogen Peroxide, and Temperature
The subsequent experiments
aimed at revealing the optimal initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide,
catalyst loading, and reaction temperature were performed under the
above-mentioned reaction conditions. The results of these studies
presented in Figure 11 showed that the most significant influence on the extent of total
phenols and TOC removal had the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration.

Figure 11 Time
dependence of hydrogen peroxide decomposition (a–c)
and total phenol content (d–f) with points representing the
experiment and lines representing the kinetic model. In (a) and (d), cHP,0 = 0–1.34 M, T =
353 K, mCu/13X-K1273-1 =
2.5; in (g), (b), and (e), cHP,0 = 0.5
M, T = 353 K, mCu/13X-K1273-1 = 0–5 g; and in (c) and (f), cHP,0 = 0.5 M, T = 323–353 K, mCAT = 2.5 g. In all cases, N = 600 min–1 and dB = 0.4–0.63
mm.

By increasing the initial content
of the oxidant, the rate and
the extent of the total phenols, TOC, and COD removal increased. At
higher initial concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (above 0.75 M),
when all total phenols that constitute approximately 17 wt % in TOC
loading are eliminated, no significant increase in the oxidation rate
of polyphenols can be observed. This is considered to be the consequence
of the intensification of side reactions of hydroxyl radicals and
the scavenging effect of the oxidant as described earlier (eqs 4–6). However, oxidation of intermediates that are formed by
polyphenol conversion becomes significant, further decreasing the
organic content of the reaction mixture. The best results were obtained
in the reaction conducted with the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration
of 1.34 mol dm–3 at 353 K and with 2.5 g of catalyst
when ∼97% of total phenols and 47% of TOC reduction were achieved
with a rather small copper leaching (Figure 12).

Figure 12 Influence of the initial hydrogen peroxide
concentration on TOC
and COD conversions and copper leaching in the reactions with the
Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst (cHP,0 = 0–1.34
M, T = 353 K, N = 600 min–1, mCu/13X-K1273-1 = 2.5
g, dB = 0.4–0.63 mm).

A higher catalyst bulk concentration gave more
prominent hydrogen
peroxide decomposition, and total phenol oxidation increased as expected
(Figure 11b,e).

In contrast to the reports published for similar catalytic systems,36 no limit of catalyst loading was observed and
the reaction rates increased proportionally with the mass of the catalyst
added to the reactor.

The increase in the reaction temperature
(Figure 11c,f) had
a similar beneficial effect on
the catalyst activity, yielding higher conversions of both reactants
at elevated temperatures.

3.5 Kinetic Analysis
In heterogeneous
catalysis, intrinsic kinetics can be evaluated only if the external
or internal mass transfer resistances are not affecting the surface
reaction rate. The above-presented results and discussion of the diffusion
influence in CWPO of polyphenols from OOMW over the Cu/13X-K1273-1
catalyst indicate that for a stirring speed of 600 rpm, catalyst size
of 0.4–0.63 mm, and the catalyst loading of 2.5 g the external
and internal mass transfer resistances for both the oxidant and the
polyphenols are minimized and that the surface reaction can be presumed
to be the slowest step in the overall reaction rate.

As mentioned
before, the CWPO reaction mechanism is very complex, consisting of
numerous parallel and serial reactions involving different molecular
and radical species. However, the following main reaction steps can
be identified: initiation of catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide,
which results in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (eq 1), followed by the oxidation of
polyphenols and intermediates (propagation, eq 3), and finally a loss of hydroxyl radicals
in the nondesired side reactions (termination, eq 4–6). In a very
simplistic form, the oxidation pathway can be represented as 16  Because of the
complexity of the system, performing
a detailed kinetic analysis is challenge even for the model wastewaters
where most of the organic compounds present in the reaction mixture
are known. The composition of the real wastewater effluent produced
during olive oil extraction depends on the production process used,
olive species, and climate region, but, in general, OOMW contains
more than 30 different polyphenols as well as other prone to oxidation
organic acids that can engage in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide
and hydroxyl radicals.

The presence of inorganic salts such
as chlorides and phosphates
complicates the matter further.3 The heterogeneity
of the OOMW composition as well as the reaction scheme complexity
make carrying out the detailed kinetic study next to impossible that
would incorporate all individual reactions with all of the initial
and intermediate compounds and radicals.37,38 Because of this, the kinetic modeling is often limited to some parameter
that represents the group of targeted compounds or major constituents
of the wastewater such as COD, TOC, or total phenol content.

On the basis of the kinetic regularities and literature data for
similar catalytic systems,39,40 the following kinetic
model for polyphenol oxidation and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide
was proposed 17   18  where cTPh is
the molar concentration of total phenols expressed as gallic acid
equivalent, cHP is the molar concentration
of hydrogen peroxide, and γCAT is the catalyst loading in g
dm–3. The total phenol content was divided into
two fractions: more reactive (cTPh,1)
and less reactive (cTPh,2) based on preliminary
analysis of the obtained experimental data. In all performed experiments,
two reaction phases could clearly be distinguished: a fast decrease
of the total phenol content, which occurred within the first 30–60
min of the reaction, and slow oxidation of the remaining less-reactive
fraction of total polyphenols present in the reaction mixture. The
initial value of the concentration ratio of the two polyphenol fractions
was set as 0.5 during parameter estimation analysis. Reaction constants
(kTPh,1, kTPh,2, and kHP), reaction orders in reactants
and the catalyst (n1, n2, n3, n4), and concentration ratio of the polyphenol fractions are
the kinetic parameters that were estimated during modeling. These
expressions take into account that the oxidation rate of polyphenols
depends on the concentrations of both reactants and the catalyst loading
and that the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide considers the
contribution of not only the reaction with polyphenols but also the
side reactions of hydrogen peroxide decomposition. The contribution
of the noncatalytic hydrogen peroxide decomposition and polyphenol
oxidation was also considered based on the data acquired during reactions
without a catalyst. However, it was found that the noncatalytic contribution
to the overall reaction rate was marginal. The estimation of the kinetic
parameters was carried out by nonlinear regression analysis using
simulation and parameter estimation software MODEST.41 Ordinary differential equations (eqs 17 and 18) were solved
with the backward difference method. The sum of residual squares (Q) 19  was minimized with the hybrid Simplex–Levenberg–Marquardt
method, where yexp represents experimental
data and yest represents the estimated
values, i.e., the concentrations.

In the first iteration, the
polyphenol oxidation reaction orders
in polyphenols and hydrogen peroxide concentration were identified
in a run with all of the kinetic parameters set as floating. In most
cases, the polyphenol oxidation reaction orders with respect to phenol
(n1), hydrogen peroxide (n2), and catalyst concentration (n3) were close to 1, whereas the order of hydrogen decomposition
reaction with respect to hydrogen peroxide was close to 2 (n4). The second iteration of modeling was performed
with fixed reaction orders, and the results are shown in Table 5 and Figures 11 and 13.

peroxide (a) and total polyphenol (b) concentration.

Taking into account the complexity of the reaction
mixture and
limitations of the analytical methods, the obtained results show good
agreement of the experiment and the proposed kinetic model for both
hydrogen peroxide decomposition and polyphenol oxidation. In general,
the fit is better for hydrogen peroxide decomposition, whereas the
worst agreement for the polyphenol oxidation was achieved for the
reactions in which the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide
was the lowest, indicating that for these reactions one of the kinetic
model assumptions does not hold.

Activation energies for hydrogen
peroxide decomposition and polyphenol
oxidation over the pelleted Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst were determined
from the temperature dependencies of the calculated rate constants
described by a modified Arrhenius equation 20  where kav is the
constant at the average temperature of the experiments Tav. The obtained values of activation energies for hydrogen
peroxide decomposition and polyphenol oxidation of Ea,HP = 30.1 kJ mol–1, Ea,TPh,1 = 62.2 kJ mol–1 and ETPH,2 = 90.1 kJ mol–1 are
in the range of values reported for similar model reaction systems
using powdered catalysts,9,14,29,39 i.e., 45–140 kJ mol–1.

3.6 Catalyst Testing in Olive
Oil Mill Wastewater
Treatment
The catalyst performance was finally tested in
the prolonged reaction over 10 h to determine whether the catalyst
gets deactivated with prolonged use. From the results presented in Figure 14, it can be seen
that the oxidation of organic content continues after phenolics are
eliminated, demonstrating the catalyst ability to enhancing peroxidation
of not only phenols but also other organic compounds present in the
olive oil mill wastewater, resulting in complete conversion of total
phenols and 52% conversion of TOC. The Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst preserved
its stability even after 10 h of reaction when only 3.3 wt % copper
leached from the catalyst. By a comparison of the fresh and spent
catalysts, it was observed that the catalyst maintained its initial
surface area and pore volume (SFRESH =
26 m2 g–1 and Vp,FRESH = 0.03 cm3 g–1 to SSPENT-10h = 25 m2 g–1 and Vp,SPENT-10h = 0.03 cm3 g–1). Although the loss of 3.3 wt % of
the initial copper content from the catalyst is not negligible, this
result is very encouraging when compared to that of similar catalytic
systems described in the literature. The extent of leaching of the
Cu/13X-K1273 pelletized catalyst is generally lower when compared
to that of other zeolite or zeolite-based catalysts9,13,42 and is comparable to leaching of copper-containing
pillared clay catalysts according to the work of Inchaurrondo et al.29 However, most of these results are connected
to CWPO studies of model or often highly diluted wastewaters, which
should be taken into account when comparing them with the results
of this study where a real industrial effluent was used because the
extent of metal leaching from the catalyst depends not only on the
catalyst type or support material but also very strongly on the reaction
conditions such as temperature, pH, and particular organic compound
species and their concentrations.

4 Conclusions
Postsynthesis thermal treatment was beneficial for catalytic behavior
of the copper-containing 13X zeolite in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation
of OOMW as it resulted in an increased stability against leaching,
allowing better removal of total phenols TOC due to the presence of
pore diffusion limitations for polyphenols in the noncalcined Cu/13X-1
catalyst. Results of mass transfer and diffusion investigation for
the calcined Cu/13X-K1273-1 catalyst excluded the influence of both
external and internal mass transfer limitations. It was found that
the rate of phenol oxidation and hydrogen peroxide decomposition increased
with the increase of stirrer speed, catalyst loading, initial hydrogen
peroxide concentration, and reaction temperature and with the decrease
of catalyst bead size. Kinetic analysis of the catalytic system was
preformed, the reaction orders in reactants and in the catalyst were
identified, and parameters of the proposed kinetic model and activation
energies were determined. By treating the industrial olive oil mill
wastewater in a catalytic wet peroxide oxidation process over thermally
stabilized copper-containing zeolite-based catalyst under mild reaction
conditions (353 K and atmospheric pressure), it is possible to achieve
complete conversion of total phenols and over 50% conversion of TOC,
substantially minimizing copper leaching.
