Motivated by the recent synthesis
of the graphene-like C3N nanosheet, the geometrical structures
and electronic properties
of its ribbon form, that is, C3N nanoribbons (C3NNRs), are investigated by first-principles calculations. It is found
that there are five types of energetically favorable H-terminated
edges in the C3NNRs. Different from graphene nanoribbons,
the corresponding stable C3NNRs are all nonmagnetic semiconductors
regardless of the edge shape and termination. However, their band
feature and gap size can be modulated by the ribbon width and edge
termination, which brings direct-, quasi-direct-, and indirect-band-gap
semiconducting behaviors in the nanoribbons. Comparing to the C3N nanosheet, the work function is reduced in the C3NNRs with fully di- and monohydrogenated edges, which results in
a type-II band alignment with SiC and silicane nanosheets. More interestingly,
the combined hetero-nanostructures will be promising excitonic solar
cell materials with high power conversion efficiencies up to 17–21%.
Our study demonstrates that the C3NNRs have distinct edge
stabilities and variable semiconducting behaviors, which endow fascinating
potential applications in the fields of solar energy and nanodevices.

1 Introduction
Carbon nitride nanomaterials
have attracted abundant scientific
attention because of their variable chemical composition and promising
electronic properties for wide-range applications.1,2 Two-dimensional
(2D) C3N4,3 C4N3,4 and C2N5 nanosheets have already been synthesized
in the experiments, which are nitrogenated holey honeycombs with different
nanopore sizes. Versatile electronic and magnetic properties are found
in these carbon nitrides, which are related to the holey geometrical
characteristic.6−9 Besides that, porous C3N5,10 C3N2,11 C7N6,12 and C9N413 nanosheets have
also been theoretically proposed, which possess unique electronic
and topological properties as functional carbon nitrides. The hole-free
structure is found to be dynamically unstable in the CN honeycomb,14 which only appears in the C-rich case. Starting
from the N-doped graphene, 2D C1−δNδ alloy can maintain the hexagonal lattice up to the N concentration
of δ = 1/3.15 Interestingly, for
δ = 1/4, an ordered C3N arrangement is predicted
to be the ground state structure of the graphene-like C1−δNδ system.15,16 This C3N
structure is isostructural to the C3B17,18 and C3Si19,20 nanosheets, where C atoms compose
the separated C6 hexagons that are interconnected by N
atoms.

Very recently, utilizing the direct solid-state reaction
of organic
molecules, experimenters have synthesized this theoretically predicted
C3N nanosheet.21−23 Such a graphene-like C3N nanostructure is an indirect narrow-band-gap semiconductor with
a high hole carrier mobility up to 104 cm2/V
s.24−26 The electronic structure of C3N nanosheet can be tailored
by vacancy defects and surface decorations, which would convert it
into a metal or a magnetic semiconductor.27−30 Compared to the monolayer C3N nanosheet, the band gaps of bi- and trilayer ones are pronouncedly
reduced because of the strong interlayer interaction.31,32 When stacked with arsenene monolayer, the C3N nanosheet
can form a type-II van der Waals heterostructure, whose band gap is
well modulated by the vertical strain and external electric field.33 For the C3B/C3N hetero-bilayer,
it even exhibits a Dirac fermion behavior akin to the bilayer graphene.34 Besides that, the phononic thermal transport
property has also been systematically studied in the C3N nanosheet, whose lattice thermal conductivity is found to be much
lower than the value of graphene but still higher than the ones of
BN, MoS2, MoSe2, and phosphorene systems.35−38

Because the 2D nanosheet can be regarded as a precursor of
one-dimensional
(1D) nanomaterials, which would be cut into nanoribbons or rolled
into nanotubes,39−41 the discovery of C3N nanosheet brings
interests into its 1D-forms, that is, C3N nanoribbons (C3NNRs) and nanotubes. In the literature, the electronic properties
and adsorption abilities of C3N nanotubes have been widely
investigated,42,43 which exhibit potential applications
in chemical sensors44,45 and hydrogen storage.46,47 With respect to the C3NNRs, although there is a report
on the NC3 nanoribbons,48 the
investigated structure does not correspond to the experimentally synthesized
C3N ordered arrangement. It would be noted that the properties
of nanoribbons are significantly dependent on the edge structures.
For example, in the graphene and graphyne nanoribbons,49,50 versatile magnetic and electronic behaviors can be introduced by
the mono- and dihydrogenated edges, oxidized edges, as well as metal-terminated
edges. So far, fundamental information about the structural and electronic
properties of C3NNRs is still unknown. What kind of stable
edges will appear in these C3NNRs? How about their electronic
properties? Do these C3NNRs have peculiar applications?
To address these issues, we perform a first-principles calculation
to explore the structural and electronic properties of C3NNRs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Stable
H-Terminated Edges in C3NNRs
Figure 1a depicts the geometrical structure
of the 2D C3N nanosheet,
which is a flat honeycomb sheet akin to graphene. Its lattice constant
is 4.856 Å, and the C–C and C–N bond lengths are
1.403 and 1.400 Å, respectively. The band structure of C3N nanosheet is displayed in Figure 1b, which shows an indirect-band-gap semiconducting
behavior. The valence band maximum (VBM) is located at the M point, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is doubly
degenerated at the Γ point. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) calculation obtains a band gap of 0.405 eV, and the gap size
is raised to 1.006 eV in the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE) calculation. The density of states (DOSs) and partial DOSs of
C and N atoms are depicted in Figure 1c, which indicate that the top valence states are dominated
by the C and N atoms, while the bottom conduction states are mainly
from the C atoms. This is consistent with the partial charge densities
of valence and conduction band edges in Figure 1d, which show that the VBM is composed of
C and N pz orbitals along the C–N
dimers and the CBM is originated from the C pz orbitals in C6 hexagons. All the obtained structural
and electronic properties agree well with previous results.24,25,32

Analogous to the graphene
nanoribbons, 1D regular C3NNRs can be formed by cutting
the 2D nanosheet along the armchair
and zigzag directions. As shown in Figure 1a, in the binary C3N system, there
are two kinds of edges, that is, the pure C edges (CC) and the CN
edges with alternated C and N atoms. Following the convention of nanoribbons,51 the H-passivation is used to eliminate the dangling
bonds of edge atoms. Here, a mount of different H-terminated edges
are taken into account for the C3NNRs, including the bare
and partially bare edges, mono- and dihydrogenated edges, and mixed
mono-/dihydrogenated ones. As shown in Figure 2a, these edge structures are denoted as SAxBy, where S = A (Z) stands
for the armchair (zigzag) edge shape, AB = CC (CN) denotes the CC
(CN) edge atoms, and the x/y is
the number of H atoms bonding to the edge atoms. Through enumerating
all the possible combinations in the primitive cell, we find that
there are 22 types of edge structures in the C3NNRs. The
essential parameters of their Eform calculations
are provided in Table 1. Utilizing these data, the energetically favorable edges are determined
by comparing their Eform under different
chemical potentials.

can be found in the Method section.

Figure 2b depicts
the phase diagram of most stable edges in the C3NNRs. It
can be seen that only five H-terminated edges are present in the phase
diagram. Under the C-rich condition, the CC edges are preferred, for
which the AC1C1 and AC2C2 edges will be formed
under H-poor and H-rich conditions, respectively. While under the
C-poor condition, the CN edges become more favorable, which conduces
the formation of AC1N0 and AC1N2 edges under
the H-poor and H-rich surroundings, respectively. The ZC1N1 edge is also present in the phase diagram, but it only appears in
a small area with particular ΔμC and ΔμH values. In Figure 2b, the horizontal and vertical lines correspond to the special
chemical potentials of H2 and N2 molecules,
which are ΔμH = EH2/2 – EHa = −2.296 eV and ΔμC = ((E2D – EN2/2)/3 – ECa) = −8.641
eV. The corresponding Eform variations
of different edges along these lines are depicted in Figure 2c,d, respectively. It shows
that in the case of fixed ΔμH = −2.296
eV, the edge C atoms prefer saturated H-hydrogenation. For large ΔμC values, the AC2C2 edge is the most stable one
in the C3NNRs. As ΔμC is decreased,
the Eform of this CC edge is raised while
the ones of CN edges are declined. As a result, when ΔμC < −8.332 eV, the AC2N1 edge becomes
the most favorable edge structure. While in the case of fixed ΔμC = −8.641 eV, Figure 2d indicates under the H-poor condition, the 2D C3N nanosheet is preferred to the C3NNRs. When ΔμH > −2.713 eV, the C3NNRs become more
energetically
favorable than the 2D nanosheet. The ZC1N1 edge is preferred
in a small ΔμH range of [−2.713, −2.413]
eV, and the AC2C2 edge becomes the favorable one when ΔμH > −2.413 eV. Thus, similar to graphene nanoribbons,52,53 enough H potential will benefit the formation of C3NNRs,
which not only stabilizes the edge structures but also tunes the electronic
properties of nanoribbons. Besides that, we have also performed ab
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations on the C3NNRs with these stable edges. The AIMD calculations are conducted
on C3NNRs with a Nose thermostat of 500 K for 10 ps, that
is, 104 steps with a time step of 1 fs. As shown in Figure 3, after the AIMD
simulations, although there are noticeable distortions in the C3NNRs, the whole structures still keep integrated for the ZC1N1, AC1C1, AC1C2, AC1N0,
and AC2N1 ones. This indicates that all these C3NNRs will possess good thermal stabilities, whose structural integrity
can be well maintained under room temperature.

the 10 ps AIMD simulations.

2.2 Electronic Structures of C3NNRs
Now, we pay main attention to the electronic structures of stable
C3NNRs with the above finding edges. First, the zigzag
C3NNRs with ZC1N1 edges (ZC1N1–C3NNRs) are investigated, whose geometrical structure is displayed
in Figure 4a. Here,
the ribbon width is measured by the number (NZ) of integral C6 hexagons across the nanoribbon.
It is found that all the investigated NZ-ZC1N1–C3NNRs are semiconductors as
shown in Figure 4b.
Unlike the zigzag graphene nanoribbons with an antiferromagnetic ground
state,54 the ZC1N1–C3NNRs are nonmagnetic as confirmed by the spin-polarized calculations. Figure 4c,d depicts the band
structures of 5- and 6-ZC1N1–C3NNRs.
Clearly, there are no localized flat bands near the Fermi level, which
accounts for the absence of magnetism. For these ZC1N1–C3NNRs, the band dispersions of bottom conduction and top valence
bands resemble the ones of the C3N nanosheet folded along
the zigzag direction as displayed in Figure 1e. However, because of the quantum confinement
effect in the 1D form,51 the band gaps
of ZC1N1–C3NNRs are larger than those
of the 2D nanosheet. Although these ZC1N1–C3NNRs have not been synthesized so far, the zigzag-shaped edge
has been observed in the fragment of C3N nanosheet experimentally.22 There are alternated C and N atoms along the
edge, which corresponds to the ZC1N1 edge in our work.
Moreover, in the experiment, all these finite-sized C3N
fragments with zigzag edges are found to be semiconductors, whose
band gaps are larger than the 2D nanosheet.22 This is also consistent with our calculated result as shown in Figure 4b. Depending on the
geometrical symmetry of nanoribbon, the highest occupied valence band
(HOVB) at the X point is a little higher (lower)
than the one at Γ point when the number NZ is odd (even). Thus, the 5-ZC1N1–C3NNR has an indirect band gap of 0.519 eV between the X and Γ point, while the 6-ZC1N1–C3NNR has a direct band gap of 0.520 eV at the Γ point.
This is different from the graphene and graphyne systems, where the
magnetic and metallic behaviors are identified.49,50 Further HSE calculations confirm these PBE results in Figure 4 and obtain larger gap sizes
of 1.130 and 1.138 eV for 5- and 6-ZC1N1–C3NNRs, respectively.

band gaps
vs the ribbon width NZ. The PBE and HSE

Then, the armchair C3NNRs with AC1C1 and
AC2C2 edges are investigated. The geometries of NA-AC1C1–C3NNRs
and NA-AC2C2–C3NNRs are depicted in Figure 5a,b, where the NA is also the
number of integral C6 hexagons across the nanoribbon. It
is found that for these armchair C3NNRs, the band gaps
and band features are strongly dependent on the edge terminations.
As shown in Figure 5c, the AC1C1–C3NNRs are indirect-band-gap
semiconductors, whose band gaps are larger than the value of C3N nanosheet. Contrarily, the AC2C2–C3NNRs are direct-band-gap semiconductors and the gap sizes
are smaller than the 2D value. The band structures of 5-AC1C1- and 5-AC2C2–C3NNRs are displayed in Figure 5d. Comparing to the
bands of C3N nanosheet folded along the armchair direction,
the AC1C1– and AC2C2–C3NNRs have similar dispersions for the bottom conduction bands, but
the dispersions of top valence bands are noticeably different. In
the 5-AC1C1–C3NNR, the HOVB at the Γ
point is lower than the one at the X point, resulting
in an indirect band gap of 0.600/1.258 eV by the PBE/HSE calculation.
While in the 5-AC2C2–C3NNR, one valence
band is up-shifted, which reduces the PBE/HSE band gap to 0.294/0.925
eV. In order to understand the discrepancy between 5-AC1C1– and 5-AC2C2–C3NNRs, the partial
charge densities of their band edges are depicted in Figure 6. It can be seen that for the
monohydrogenated 5-AC1C1–C3NNR, the lowest
unoccupied conduction band (LUCB) at the Γ point comes from
the C pz orbitals along the C–C
dimers in the whole nanoribbon, while the HOVB at the X point is composed of N pz and C pz orbitals at the same row, for which the
edge atoms make noticeable contributions. On the other hand, in the
dihydrogenated 5-AC2C2–C3NNR, the LUCB
at the Γ point stems from the C pz orbitals in the interior region, and the HOVB at the Γ point
is composed of N pz and C pz orbitals along the N–C dimers. It should
be noticed that there are no edge contributions in the CBM and VBM
of 5-AC2C2–C3NNR. This is consistent
with the previous study on the dihydrogenated armchair graphene nanoribbons,
which shows that the sp3-hybridized edge C atoms will not
participate in the states around the Fermi level.55 This is equivalent to reducing the effective width of nanoribbon,56 which would raise the energies of delocalized
states. Thus, one top valence band is remarkably up-shifted in the
AC2C2–C3NNR, which significantly reduces
the band gap. It would be noted that for the narrowest 2-AC2C2–C3NNR, the PBE calculation even obtains a metallic
behavior. However, the HSE calculation still predicts a semiconducting
property with a small band gap of 0.482 eV as shown in Figure 5d. Thus, it can be concluded
that all these armchair C3NNRs with hydrogenated CC edges
are semiconductors.

e/Å3.

Now, we investigate the armchair C3NNRs with AC1N0 and AC2N1 edges. The geometrical structures
of NA-AC1N0–C3NNRs
and NA-AC2N1–C3NNRs are depicted in Figure 7a,b. As shown in Figure 7c, all the investigated AC2N1–C3NNRs are semiconductors, whose band gaps are larger than the
value of C3N nanosheet. While for the AC1N0–C3NNRs, they possess smaller band gaps and the narrow nanoribbons
are even metals. Figure 7d depicts the band structure of 2-AC1N0–C3NNR, which shows the bottom conduction and top valence bands are
quite dispersive. Both the PBE and HSE calculations indicate that
there are two bands crossing the Fermi level, which leads to the metallic
feature of nanoribbons. However, for wider nanoribbons, such as the
5-AC1N0–C3NNR in Figure 7d, these bands become flat and open a sizeable
PBE/HSE gap of 0.130/0.600 eV. While for the C3NNR with
AC2N1 edges, the band gap variation is analogous to the
nanoribbons with AC1C1 edges. As shown in Figure 7d, the band structure of 5-AC2N1–C3NNR resembles that of 5-AC1C1–C3NNR, which is also an indirect-band-gap semiconductor
with a PBE/HSE gap of 0.707/1.390 eV between the X–Γ point. This similarity can be understood that because
of the saturated hydrogenation,55,56 the next-to-edge atoms,
instead of the out-side edge ones, will participate in the states
of AC2N1–C3NNRs around the Fermi level.
Because the next-to-edge atoms are pure C–C dimers in the AC2N1–C3NNRs, just like the AC1C1 ones, it thus can be expected that the electronic behaviors of AC2N1–C3NNRs are quite similar to those of
AC1C1 nanoribbons.

2.3 Potential
Solar Cell Applications of C3NNRs
Finally, the
work functions (W) of C3NNRs are investigated,
which are calculated as
the energy difference between the vacuum level and Fermi level. Here,
the vacuum level is adopted to the zero point and the Fermi level
is set at the middle of band gap. Thus, the work function W equals to (EVBM + ECBM)/2, where EVBM and ECBM are the absolute energies of
VBM and CBM. To avoid the underestimation of ECBM, the W values are calculated from the
HSE data. As shown in Figure 8a, comparing to the C3N nanosheet, the C3NNRs with AC1C1, AC2C2, ZC1N1, and
AC2N1 edges have smaller work functions, while the ones
with AC1N0 edge have bigger W values.
Such a phenomenon is related to the edge dipole in the nanoribbons,
whose work function can be lowered (raised) by the edge dipole pointing
outward (inward) the ribbon.57 Here, for
the fully H-terminated edges, the H atoms are positively charged while
the C and N edge atoms are negatively charged. Thus, there are edge
dipoles pointing outward the nanoribbons, which reduces the work function
of C3NNRs with AC1C1, AC2C2, ZC1N1, and AC2N1 edges in Figure 8a. On the other hand, in the AC1N0–C3NNRs, the bare N edge atoms are still negatively
charged, which leads to edge dipoles pointing inward the nanoribbon.
As a result, the work function is raised in the AC1N0–C3NNRs. Because the edge dipole effect is weakened with the
increase of ribbon width, the work function of wide C3NNRs
will approach the value of C3N nanosheet as shown in Figure 8a.

five types of stable C3NNRs with
different widths. (b) Band alignment between SiC nanosheet and NA-AC2C2–C3NNRs

(c) Corresponding band alignment between the silicane nanosheet and
C3NNRs, NA-AC1C1–C3NNRs (NA = 8–12), NZ-ZC1N1–C3NNRs

as a function of the donor band gap and CBO, in which the data of
different C3NNR–SiC/silicane heterostructures are
marked and the maximum values are listed.

For the C3N nanosheet, our HSE calculations indicate
that the CBM (−2.831 eV) and VBM (−3.838 eV) are both
located in the band gap of SiC nanosheet, which leads to a type-I
band alignment as shown in Figure 8b. Considering that the C3NNRs with AC1C1, AC2C2, ZC1N1, and AC2N1 edges have smaller work functions, their band edges will be up-shifted
relative to the C3N nanosheet. As shown in Figure 8b, our HSE calculations obtain
the ECBM values of 8–12-AC2C2–C3NNRs and 7–11-AC2N1–C3NNRs as −1.943 to −2.123 and −1.925 to
−2.209 eV, respectively, which are all higher than the CBM
(−2.217 eV) of SiC nanosheet. Meanwhile, the EVBM values of these C3NNRs are also higher
than the VBM of SiC nanosheet, thus forming a type-II band alignment.
It means that when the AC2C2–/AC2N1–C3NNRs are superimposed on the SiC nanosheet, the SiC layer
will be an acceptor while the C3NNRs will be the donor.
Simultaneously, the AC2C2–C3NNRs and
AC2N1–C3NNRs exhibit a strong adsorption
ability for the solar-light around the 2–4 eV in Figure 8d. Thus, the combined AC2C2–/AC2N1–C3NNRs–SiC
heterostructures will be utilized as an excitonic solar cell, whose
power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be estimated as  where Jsc, Voc, βFF, and Psolar are the short circuit current,
the open-circuit
voltage, the band-fill factor, and the incident solar radiation, respectively.58,59 Following previous work,59−62 the βFF value is set to 0.65, Voc is adopted to Edg – ECBO – 0.3, where Edg is the band gap of donor part, ECBO is the conduction band offset (CBO) between the acceptor
and donor materials, and 0.3 is an empirical factor for energy conversion
kinetics. The Jsc is calculated by the
integral in the numerator in the limit external quantum efficiency
of 100%, and the Psolar in the denominator
is the integrated AM 1.5 solar energy flux, which amounts to 1000
W/m2. As shown in Figure 8b, the CBO values between the 8 and 12-AC2C2–C3NNRs and SiC nanosheet are 0.274–0.093
eV, while the Edg values of these AC2C2–C3NNRs are 0.956–0.97 eV. These
values meet the requirement for a high PCE in Figure 8e. Therefore, the ηPCE values
of these AC2C2–C3NNRs/SiC heterosystems
will be as high as 12.5–18.7%. Similarly, the NA-AC2N1–C3NNRs/SiC ones also
possess a ηPCE of 15.7–21.9% for the NA = 7–11 case. For the NZ-ZC1N1– and NA-AC1C1–C3NNRs, their ECBM are low to −2.359 to −2.523
and −2.548 to −2.665 eV for the NZ = 6–10 and NA = 8–12
cases, which cannot form a type-II band alignment with the SiC nanosheet.
However, through scanning the possible 2D nanosheets, we find that
they will match the band edges of silicane nanosheet.63 As shown in Figure 8c, the 2D C3N nanosheet still forms a type-I band
alignment with the silicane nanosheet. However, for the ZC1N1– and AC1C1–C3NNRs, our HSE calculations
found that their ECBM values are above
the one (−2.686 eV) of silicane nanosheet and can form a type-II
band alignment with it. These ZC1N1– and AC1C1–C3NNRs/silicane heterosystems are also promising
solar cell materials, whose ηPCE values are up to
14.3–17.4 and 19.5–21.5%, respectively. The maximum
PCE values are summarized in Figure 8d, which are 17.4% of the ZC1N1–C3NNRs/silicane, 18.7% of the AC2C2–C3NNRs/SiC, 21.5% of AC1C1–C3NNRs/silicane,
and 21.9% of the AC2N1–C3NNRs/SiC systems.
These values are larger than the previously reported data of ZrS2/MoTe2 (12%),64 MoS2/bilayer phosphorene (16–18%),59 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)/Al2C (12–18%),60 AsI3/SbI3 (18.4%)65 heterosystems, which are comparable to the values
of AsP/GaN (22.1%)61 and lateral TMDs (23%)66 ones. This result indicates that the C3NNRs would be fascinating materials for green and sustainable energy
applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have investigated the geometrical structures and
electronic properties of C3NNRs. Five types of H-terminated
edge structures are found as the energetically favorable edges in
the C3NNRs, which are monohydrogenated zigzag CN edge (ZC1N1), mono- and dihydrogenated armchair CC edges (AC1C1 and AC2C2), partially N-bare armchair CN edge (AC1N0), and mixed di/monohydrogenated one (AC2N1).
Different from graphene nanoribbons, the C3NNRs with these
stable edges are all nonmagnetic semiconductors, whose band features
and gap sizes are determined by the edge termination and ribbon width.
The ZC1N1–C3NNRs can be direct- or quasi-direct
band gaps depending on the ribbon width, while the AC1C1– and AC2N1–C3NNRs possess robust
indirect band gap feature. The band gaps of these three C3NNRs are all larger than the 2D value, but for the AC2C2- and AC1N0-ones, they have smaller gap sizes and will
be direct- or indirect-band-gap semiconductors depending on the edge
H-terminations. Comparing to the C3N nanosheet, the full
H-terminations on the edges will reduce the work function of C3NNRs, which causes the dihydrogenated AC2C2–
and AC2N1–C3NNRs (monohydrogenated AC1C1– and ZC1N1–C3NNRs)
to form a type-II band alignment with the SiC (silicane) nanosheet.
The combined hetero-nanostructures will be promising excitonic solar
cell materials, which possess high power conversion efficiencies up
to 17–21%. Our study demonstrates that the C3NNRs
have distinct edge stabilities and variable semiconducting behaviors,
which enable fascinating utilization in the fields of solar energy
and nanodevices for them.

4 Method
The first-principles
calculations are performed by the Siesta code,67 which adopts a double-ζ plus polarization
basis set with norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The grid cutoff is
set to 200 Ry, and the PBE exchange–correlation functional
is used. During the AIMD calculation, a small single-ζ basis
plus polarization orbitals basis set with a low grid cutoff of 150
Ry is used to reduce the required computational resource. The k-meshes
of 25 × 25 × 1 and 1 × 12(15) × 1 are used for
the 2D nanosheet and 1D armchair (zigzag) nanoribbons, respectively.
To simulate the isolated nanostructure, a vacuum layer of 15 Å
is added in the nonperiodic directions. All the geometrical structures
are fully optimized until the maximum residual force is less than
0.02 eV/Å. The hybrid HSE calculation is further performed to
check the obtained band structures by the FHI-aims code,68,69 which utilizes the HSE06 form with a screening parameter of 0.25
bohr–1 and a mixing parameter of 0.5 for the short-range
exchange.70

To compare the energetic
stability of different edges, the formation
energies (Eform) are calculated as Eform = (ENRs – nCμC – nNμN – nHμH)/2L.71,72 Here, the ENRs is the total energy of
the C3N nanoribbon, nC/nN are the numbers of C/N/H atoms in the nanoribbon,
and μC/μN is the corresponding chemical
potential. L is the edge length and the factor 2
comes from the two edges of nanoribbons. To obtain converged energy
values, wide nanoribbons with the width of more than 25 Å are
used in the Eform calculations. Considering
the thermodynamic equilibrium condition of C3N nanosheet,
it requires 3μC + μN = E2D, where μC and μN are
the respective chemical potentials of C and N elements, and E2D is the total energy of the 2D C3N nanosheet per formula unit (f.u.). Here, 1 f.u. corresponds to
three C atoms and one N atom. Thus, the μC value
can be varied in the range of [(E2D – ENa)/3, ECa], where ENa and ECa are the energies of isolated
N and C atoms at the spin-polarized state. Here, μN = ENa and μC = ECa corresponding
to the N-rich and C-rich conditions, respectively. For concision,
we adopt ΔμC = μC – ECa and ΔμH = μH – EHa, where EHa is also the atomic energy of isolated H atom.
Both the ΔμC and ΔμH have the upper limit of 0 eV, and for ΔμC, the lower limit corresponds to (E2D – ENa)/3 – ECa = −10.38
eV. Thus, the formula of formation energy can be rewritten as Eform = ΔENRs – ρC–NΔμC –
ρHΔμH, where ΔENRs = [ENRs – nNE2D – (nC – 3nN)ECa – nHEHa]/2L, ρC–N = (nC –
3nN)/2L, and ρH = nH/2L as shown
in Table 1. Following
this definition, the more negative the Eform value, the more energetically favorable the corresponding edge structure.
