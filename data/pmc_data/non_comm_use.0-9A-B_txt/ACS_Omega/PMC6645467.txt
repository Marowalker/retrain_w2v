Real-time
morphology/structure changes in individual hydrogel microspheres
(microgels) were directly visualized at high spatiotemporal resolution
using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) under temperature
control ranging from room temperature to ∼40 °C. The recorded
HS-AFM movies demonstrate that the size and morphology of thermoresponsive
poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)-based microgels change
with increasing temperature at the individual microgel level. Specifically,
the height of the microgels gradually decreases and domain structures
appeared even below the volume phase transition temperature. Moreover,
the domain structure is retained, even after the microgels have fully
collapsed. The present study thus demonstrates that temperature-controlled
HS-AFM is a useful tool for monitoring stimulus-responsiveness of
microgels. In the near future, it should furthermore be possible to
extend this temperature-controlled HS-AFM to other stimulus-responsive
materials, including autonomously oscillating microgels.

Introduction
As stimulus-responsive
polymeric materials undergo dramatic changes
in their structure/shape and physical/chemical properties in response
to changes in the environment,1−7 they are also called “smart materials”. The key factors
and requirements for stimulus-responsive materials to undergo changes
are to be fast, reversible, complex, and robust in response to the
external stimuli.5 One type of stimulus-responsive
materials with the potential to fulfill the aforementioned requirements
is hydrogel microspheres (microgels). Microgels are colloidal particles
that can respond rapidly to external stimuli because of their microscopic
dimensions.8−14 Owing to their rapid stimulus-responsiveness, microgels have been
used for numerous applications in, for example, molecular separation,
drug-delivery vehicles, sensors, and actuators.9−14 A recent significant advance in stimulus-responsive materials is
autonomously oscillating microgels, which show periodical and reversible
changes in size and the state of assembly in the absence of an external
stimulus.15−18

So far, the stimulus-responsive properties of microgels have
been
mainly evaluated by scattering techniques,19−24 calorimetry,9,25,26 sensors,27,28 and so forth. However, these
techniques provide ensemble-averaged signals for the entire system.
Therefore, undesired artifacts such as unexpected morphology changes
in microgels induced by external stimuli might be included in the
obtained data, which would hamper the correct interpretation of the
data. More reliable data and a deeper insight into the stimulus-responsive
behavior of individual microgels should be obtained from real-time
direct observations of microgels, which should provide accurate and
relevant information on the morphological changes experienced by microgels.
In this context, high-resolution microscopy techniques, such as atomic
force microscopy (AFM),29−33 super-resolution microscopy,34−36 and liquid-cell in situ transmission
electron microscopy (in situ TEM),35 have
already been employed. Despite this considerable progress, there are
still many issues that remain unresolved. For example, AFM and super-resolution
microscopy are excellent techniques to visualize microgels on the
nanoscale, albeit the temporal resolution remains problematic, that
is, real-time observations cannot be achieved using these methods.
In situ TEM allows monitoring microgels in aqueous solution; however,
previous literature reports indicate that the spatial resolution is
worse than that of cryo-TEM.35

In
the present study, we have achieved a direct visualization of
thermoresponsive morphological changes in individual microgels in
real time in aqueous solution using high-speed atomic force microscopy
(HS-AFM). HS-AFM enables monitoring the structural dynamics of active
biomolecules, such as proteins, under retention of their physiological
functions.37−39 We have previously used HS-AFM to observe adsorption
processes of microgels onto a solid substrate and found that soft
colloidal particles adsorb on solid–liquid interfaces faster
than hard ones.40 In the present study,
we have investigated how highly water-swollen microgels respond to
temperature changes using temperature-controlled HS-AFM (Figure 1a).

Results and Discussion
Thermoresponsive
microgels were obtained from the aqueous free-radical
precipitation polymerization of N-isopropyl acrylamide
(NIPAm) and the cross-linker N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS; 1 or 5 mol %; hereafter denoted
N1 and N5, respectively) (Table 1). Figure 2 shows the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) of the polyNIPAm microgels in water as a function of the temperature
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The Dh of the microgels decreases with increasing temperature,
reaching an equilibrium at ∼40 °C. The volume phase transition
temperatures (VPTT) for N1 and N5 were estimated to be ∼33
and ∼35 °C, respectively, on the basis of the maximum
change ratio of the volume of the microgels.

To visualize the microgels deposited on a substrate
by HS-AFM,
3 μL of a microgel dispersion (0.001 wt %) was placed on a highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate. Subsequently, the substrate
was thoroughly rinsed with pure water to remove any excess microgels.
The adsorbed microgels on the HOPG substrate were imaged by HS-AFM
in pure water at room temperature (∼25 °C), and then,
the temperature-control device was employed to heat the solution (∼1.5
°C/min) during the imaging (Figure 1b). Figure 3a shows clipped HS-AFM images of the N1 microgels during
the heating (Movie S1). The N1 microgels
exhibited an inhomogeneously collapsed morphology surrounded by a
flattened corona of a loosely cross-linked polymer shell at 25 °C
(Figure 3a), which
is probably due to their highly soft nature. Here, a maximum height
of the adsorbed microgels was approximately 50 nm (Figure 3b at 25.0 °C and Figure 3e), which was ∼8
times smaller than Dh of the N1 microgels
at 25 °C (396 nm), indicating highly deformed N1 microgels on
the substrate because of their high softness. Upon heating the solution,
the height of the N1 microgels gradually decreased (Figure 3e). During the whole process,
the N1 microgels exhibited an inhomogeneous and nonhemispherical morphology
(Figure 3a,b, as well
as Movie S1). In contrast, the N5 microgels
with a higher cross-linking density exhibited a relatively hemispherical
morphology at 25 °C compared to that of the N1 microgels on the
same substrate. Here, a maximum height of the adsorbed N5 microgel
was 146 nm (Figure 3d at 25.6 °C and Figure 3f), which was ∼3 times smaller than the Dh of the N5 microgels at 25 °C (450 nm). Upon heating
the solution, the N5 microgels gradually contracted, and then, polymer-rich
domains clearly appeared on the surface (Figure 3c and Movie S2).

temperature. Temperature dependence for the cross section profiles
of (b) N1 and (d) N5. (e, f) Time dependence of the maximum height
of (e) N1 and (f) N5 measured from the HS-AFM images.

Figure 4 shows the
temperature dependences of the normalized height of the microgels
determined by the HS-AFM images and the normalized Dh of the microgels determined by DLS. Here, the heights
and Dh of the microgels correspond to
nonequilibrium and equilibrium states of the microgels at each temperature,
respectively. Both the height and Dh of
the N1 microgels gradually decreased up to ∼31 °C and
then rapidly decreased up to the VPTT (∼33 °C), above
which both the height and Dh approached
the equilibrium state (Figure 4a,b). In the case of the N5 microgels with a higher cross-linking
density, both the height and Dh gradually
decreased up to the VPTT (∼35 °C), above which both the
height and Dh reached a near-equilibrium
state (Figure 4c,d).
Since the tendencies of the temperature dependence for the normalized
height and Dh of these microgels are similar,
it can be concluded that the size change of the microgels detected
by HS-AFM must follow the temperature change on the individual microgel
level. This behavior seems to be reflected in the rapid stimulus-responsiveness
of microgels.

Figure 4 Normalized height of (a) N1 and (c) N5 microgels measured
by HS-AFM
imaging, and normalized Dh ((b) N1 and
(d) N5) determined by DLS as a function of the temperature.

Figure 5 shows the
magnified HS-AFM images of the N5 microgels upon heating the solution.
While the microgels gradually contracted, domains (several tens of
nanometer in size) continuously and simultaneously formed on the microgels
even at ∼27.0 °C, that is, well below the VPTT of the
microgels (∼35 °C). These domains persisted near the VPTT
and did not disappear, not even at near 40 °C, where the microgels
had almost entirely collapsed. According to a previous study using
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), swollen pNIPAm-based microgels
prepared by precipitation polymerization in aqueous solution present
a core–shell structure with uniform segment distribution within
the core and thin shell (∼20 nm), where the shell thickness
is not affected by the temperature.21 Considering
the present study, the surface and/or shell of the microgels may not
always exhibit a uniform structure that may transform into an inhomogeneous
raspberry structure upon heating. On the other hand, Höfl et
al. have observed the appearance of a surface pattern on pNIPAm-based
microgels adsorbed on a substrate above the VPTT by conventional AFM.30 They speculated that such surface patterns are
probably due to the presence of collapsed dangling polymer chains
that lead to rigid globules on the microgel surface.30 Additionally, Ikkai et al. have observed a microphase separation
(size scale: 20–30 nm) in a weakly charged microgel near the
VPTT by SANS,41 which is comparable to
the domain size found in the present study. On the basis of these
reports, the formation of domains observed in the present study upon
increasing the temperature should presumably be attributed to polymer
collapsing and/or polymer–polymer association. We have clarified
that the domain formation occurs gradually at temperatures below the
VPTT and the domain formation as well as the contraction of the microgels
occurs simultaneously upon increasing the temperature.

images of an individual N5 microgel
as a function of the temperature.

It should be noted that the density fluctuation near the
volume
phase transition is largely influenced by the adsorption of the microgels
on the solid substrate.42 This means that
the thermoresponsive behavior of microgels in the dispersed state
or when adsorbed on a solid substrate might be different, although
reports describing such differences in detail remain elusive. Nevertheless,
we believe that the findings in the present study are significant
and help clarify the relationship between the morphology/structure
and physical properties of microgels adsorbed on solid substrates,
which may lead to the development of advanced functional materials,
such as switchable cell culture substrates for tissue engineering,43 where the surface roughness as well as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
are important parameters.

Conclusions
We have successfully
observed temperature-induced morphological
changes in individual microgels at the nanoscale in real time by temperature-controlled
HS-AFM. The morphology of substrate-adsorbed microgels varies with
cross-linking density. The change of the shape of the microgels follows
the change in temperature, whereby the normalized height and Dh of the microgels showed similar behavior because
of the rapid stimulus-responsiveness of the microgels. Furthermore,
the formation of domains was observed during the collapse of the microgel
structures, even below the VPTT; these domains persist, even in the
collapsed state, which indicates that the contracted microgel state
may not always be a homogeneous sphere, but often an inhomogeneous
raspberry-shaped one. The direct visualization of the behavior of
individual microgels on the nanoscale is important to gain further
insight into thermoresponsive materials. In the near future, it should
be possible to apply temperature-controlled HS-AFM to a wider range
of temperatures and stimulus-responsive materials, which may further
accelerate the development of novel smart materials.

Experimental
Section
Materials
N-Isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAm,
98%), N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide)
(BIS, 97%), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 95%), and potassium persulfate
(KPS, 95%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Japan)
and used as received. The water used in all reactions, in the preparation
of solutions, and in the purification of polymers was distilled and
ion-exchanged (EYELA, SA-2100E1).

Microgel Synthesis
PolyNIPAm microgels were synthesized
by aqueous free-radical precipitation polymerization. A mixture of
NIPAm (8.402 g/99 mol % or 8.063 g/95 mol %), BIS (0.116 g, 1 mol
% or 0.578 g/5 mol %), and SDS (0.072 g/0.5 mM for N1) in water (495
mL) was placed in a three-necked round-bottomed flask (1000 mL) equipped
with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, and a nitrogen gas inlet.
The monomer solution was heated in an oil bath to 70 °C under
nitrogen sparging (30 min) and constant stirring (250 rpm). After
stabilization for 30 min, the KPS initiator (0.270 g/2 mM) dissolved
in water (5 mL) was added to the flask to initiate the polymerization
reaction. Thereafter, stirring was continued for 4 h before the dispersion
was cooled to room temperature. The obtained microgels were purified
by two cycles of centrifugation (70 000g or
415 000g; 15 °C), decantation of the
supernatant, and redispersion of the precipitate in water. The dispersion
was then dialyzed for a week with daily water changes.

Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS) Measurements
The hydrodynamic
diameter (Dh) of the microgels was determined
by DLS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Zetasizer NanoS) measurements in
aqueous solution. The DLS data represent averages of three individual
measurements of 15 consecutive runs (30 s acquisition time of the
intensity autocorrelation). The microgel concentration was fixed at
0.001 wt %. The samples were allowed to thermally equilibrate at each
temperature for 10 min before the measurements. The time-dependent
scattering intensity was detected at a total scattering angle of 173°.
The Dh of the microgels was calculated
from the measured diffusion coefficients using the Stokes–Einstein
equation (Zetasizer software v6.12).

High-Speed Atomic Force
Microscopy (HS-AFM)
We used
the laboratory-built HS-AFM in this study, the details of which are
described elsewhere.39,40 For the HS-AFM imaging, small
cantilevers (length: 6–7 μm; width: 2 μm; thickness:
90 nm) developed by Olympus were employed. Typical spring constant,
resonant frequency, and quality factor values for the aqueous solution
of the cantilever are ∼0.1 N/m, ∼600 kHz, and ∼2,
respectively. Because the small cantilever has only a blunt bird-beak
structure at the end, a sharp amorphous carbon tip was grown on the
original tip by electron beam deposition. Then, the carbon tip was
etched to ∼4 nm in radius by a RF plasma etcher under an argon
atmosphere. For the HS-AFM imaging of the microgels, the cantilever
free-oscillation amplitude was set to 5–30 nm and the set-point
amplitude to 70–90% of the free-oscillation amplitude (depending
on the size of the microgels).

Droplets (3 μL) including
the microgel dispersion ([microgel] = 0.001 wt %) were loaded on highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates. After incubation (5
min), the substrate was thoroughly rinsed with pure water to remove
residual microgels, and HS-AFM imaging was performed at room temperature
(T ≈ 25 °C; scanning area: 1000 ×
1000 nm2; 120 × 120 pixels2; frame rate
= 1 fps).

To monitor the real-time thermoresponsive morphological
changes
in the microgels, a temperature-control device was equipped in HS-AFM.
The solution was heated by flowing a direct current through indium-tin-oxide
glass at the bottom of the cantilever holder. The thermocouple was
attached to the cantilever holder and immersed in the solution. The
solution temperature can be controlled by a feedback control on the
software of HS-AFM. Using this system, the temperature of the aqueous
solution within the HS-AFM fluid cell was increased at a rate of ∼1.5
°C/min. The temperature was measured every 10 s at different
values of input voltage (1.7 to +0.2 V every 30 s) and plotted as
a function of time (Figure 1b).
