Superhydrophobic and lubricated slippery
surfaces were tested under
high salinity inorganic scaling medium and had their antifouling capacity
assessed by optical and electron microscopy. The superhydrophobic
surfaces were build up with hierarchically rough electropolymerized
polyaniline onto stainless steel substrates and functionalized with
low-polarizability thiols. Subsequently, these materials were lubricated
with perfluorinated oil to obtain slippery surfaces. Regardless of
the large amount of inorganic scale found onto superhydrophobic surfaces
after the scaling test, the slippery ones showed to be very efficient
as fouling preventers. From crystal quartz microbalance experiments,
the wetting regime of the superhydrophobic surfaces was evaluated
and shows that the Cassie–Baxter effect was not lost during
the entire scaling test. The interfaces energies of the systems were
assessed with contact angle experiments and showed that the scaling
increases because the interfacial free energy is minimized. These
results lead to a better understanding of how superhydrophobic surfaces
could induce inorganic scaling instead of preventing it.

Introduction
Inorganic scaling mitigation plays an
important role in many industrial
facilities, as boilers of hard water systems and pipes of offshore
oil industry. However, it is challenging due to delays in production
to repair scaled walls and use of inhibitor agents, which results
in elevated costs, loss of productivity, and environment impact. Alternatively,
surface modification may be employed to prevent scale formation, but
it is important to understand the physical–chemical aspects
of the interfaces involved in the scaling processes.

Looking
at nature, it is possible to find several ways to prevent
adhesion of matter where it is not advantageous, such as leaf surfaces,1−4 wings,3,4 and eyes of insects.5,6 In
some of these cases, the low adhesion results in a self-cleaning effect.
The most notorious case may be the one called lotus effect,1 which is the ability of some leaves to keep clean
due to the low adhesion of water and contaminants over themselves,
provided by the combination of hierarchical topography and hydrophobic
composition, and is in accordance with the model proposed by Cassie
and Baxter7 to explain the contact angle
between a liquid droplet and a rough surface.

In the same direction,
inspired by a natural effect that can be
observed in pitcher plants, Wong et al.8 developed the called slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS),
which present omniphobic behavior due to their low polarizability
liquid interface.

Both the lotus self-cleaning and the pitcher
plants slippery effects
are promising options to be mimicked to create materials or coatings
that can prevent inorganic scale formation.9−11 In both cases,
the direct contact of the surface with the brine is minimized. In
the lotus effect, contact is minimized by an air cap that lies between
solid and liquid phases, whereas on the slippery surface, the lubricant
oil acts like the barrier that prevents the direct contact and adhesion
between scale and solid surface.

Barthlott and Neinhuis1 conducted experiments
of adhesion of contaminants onto superhydrophobic self-cleaning leaves,
like barium sulfate particles, among others, and showed that the lotus
effect is efficient to reduce the adhesion of the contaminants with
the leaf surface. Nonetheless, the experiments were conducted with
crystals particles spread in air and, only after that, washed by water,
simulating natural dust and rainy conditions to which leaves are exposed.
Literature shows12 that biofouling onto
a material is decreased by lowering its surface energy, but biological
systems are much more complex than inorganic ones, and not necessarily
follow the same fouling mechanisms. Schmüser et al.13 showed the low adhesion of proteins onto superamphiphobic
surfaces due to the air cushion formed in their hierarchical structure.
Nonetheless, inorganic scaling medium with a high ionic strength,
such as found in many industrial processes, are quite different from
natural dirtying and washing of leaves as well as from biofouling
processes, thus requiring specific experiments to be well understood.
Reported works with inorganic scaling nucleated in situ had shown
diversity of results in such matter.14−17

Several works demonstrated
that electropolymerized polyaniline
could achieve hierarchical structure either for galvanostatic18 or potentiostatic19 methods, varying parameters like time of reaction,18 current or tension applied,20 substrate shape,21,22 and electrolyte utilized for
electropolymerization.23 Furthermore, polyaniline
can be easily functionalized by thiol groups,22,24 leading to surfaces with different polarity and polarizability,
depending on the thiol chain utilized. Despite its mechanical fragility,
electropolymerized polyaniline is highly eligible to act as a model
to study the effects of the above-mentioned surfaces due to its easy,
reproducible, and well-controlled production, which leads to very
fashioned structures.

Thereby, the objective of this work is
to develop both superhydrophobic
Cassie–Baxter surfaces, inspired by the lotus effect, and SLIPS
surfaces and test them in high salinity scaling medium, where the
inorganic crystals will be nucleated in situ, to assess not only their
antiscaling capacity but also the stability of both kinds of effects
under such conditions. Thus, electropolymerized polyaniline was used
as rough coating over plain stainless steel substrate. Krytox GPL105,
a perfluorinated oil, was used as lubricant oil to impregnate the
slippery surfaces. Perfluorinated oils are well known for their low
polarizability, which implicates in a low surface tension and, so,
are commonly used in the lubrication of such surfaces.8,9

Results and Discussion
Polyaniline can be obtained by electropolymerization
and results
in a rough surface coating, presenting interlaced wire-like structures
with interconnect hollows,18,20,23,25,26 which are useful for producing both superhydrophobic self-cleaning
surfaces22,27,28 and lubricated
slippery ones.8,9 Also, by varying parameters such
as time of reaction and current applied, it is possible to change
the roughness of the surface.

All samples presented an emerald
green color during the electropolymerization
and became darker with the progress of reaction. After washing with
water and ethanol, they became bluish. Following the deprotonation
with ammonium hydroxide, their color resulted in a mixture of violet
and blue. As Stejskal et al.29 showed,
the color of electropolymerized polyaniline varies depending on the
protonation degree and oxidation state. According to this statement,
there were both emeraldine and pernigraniline oxidation states of
polyaniline in the electropolymerized substrates.

The samples
electropolymerized onto stainless steel disks, without
any functionalization or lubrication, were assessed by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The micrographs (Figure 1) showed that, after 600 s
of the electropolymerization reaction, the whole stainless steel surface
was covered by a thick layer of polyaniline, presenting a hierarchical
structure with interconnected microwires covered with nanostructures.

Figure 1 FESEM
micrographs of polyaniline electropolymerized for 600 s at
different magnifications. The bars lengths are (a) 10 μm, (b)
1 μm, and (c) 500 nm.

The functionalization of polyaniline with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol
(PFDT) by thiol group nucleophilic attack24 has the objective of changing the surface wettability from hydrophilic
to hydrophobic. Compounds with low polarizability, as the PFDT chains,
are eligible to add the hydrophobicity effect to the polyaniline surfaces,
which, combined with a hierarchical structure such as of polyaniline
electropolymerized for 600 s, can reach the superhydrophobic self-cleaning
behavior.

For the nonfunctionalized samples electropolymerized
for 600 s,
the contact angle experiment resulted in complete water absorption,
which was expected because polyaniline is a well-known hydrophilic.30 The spaces between the microstructure of polyaniline
are not small enough to prevent water to fill its hollows, and the
hydrophilic effect is accentuated by a Wenzel31 wetting state. So, the roughness allied to the hydrophilic characteristic
of polyaniline made these surfaces act like a sponge that absorbs
all the liquid.

For samples electropolymerized for 600 s and
functionalized with
PFDT, the static contact angles were not assessed because the surface
showed to be extremely water repellent. The droplet of water does
not stick onto the surface and it is not wetted by water because a
cap of air remains between the solid and liquid phases (Figure 2). This behavior looks like
an extreme Cassie–Baxter type case, with a whole film of air
trapped among the hierarchical roughness of the structure. In these
cases, hierarchical structure allied to superhydrophobic modification
of the surface by the functionalization superbly prevents water to
fill the hollows. Thus, the superhydrophobic Cassie–Baxter
surfaces were obtained by functionalization with PFDT of the rough
polyaniline structures.

Figure 2 Stainless steel 316 substrate covered by superhydrophobic
electropolymerized
polyaniline functionalized with PDFT sunk into water (a) parallelly
and (b) perpendicularly to the water surface.

It was expected that for such pronounced Cassie–Baxter
effect,
these superhydrophobic surfaces would present no significant scale
formation because there is almost no contact between the solution
and the surface. However, as shown in Figure 3c, in fact, the surface did not behave so.
As polyaniline surface absorbs most of the light incident from optical
reflectance microscopy, its surface appears dark in Figure 3, but the salt crystals deposited
reflect the incident light and appear bright.

scaling test, and (c) functionalized with PFDT after scaling test.
The insets are the FESEM micrographs of the corresponding scaled surfaces.

To explain these results, two
approaches have been considered,
one regarding the contact area of the liquid and the solid surface
phases and other regarding its interfacial energy.

It was expected
that for a such low contact area between the liquid
and the solid surface, due to the Cassie–Baxter regime of wetting,
the work of adhesion between the inorganic crystals and the surface
should decrease. So, the first hypothesis proposed was that some variable
during the scaling process could lead to a transition between the
Cassie–Baxter and the Wenzel wetting regime, which would increase
the contact area between the phases and thus allow the scaling to
take places onto the whole surface.

To test this hypothesis,
crystal quartz microbalance experiments
were made to evaluate the wetting regime of the surfaces. As can be
seen in Figure 4, the
results showed that the mass variation per unit of area after the
sinking of the surface into water was much greater for nonfunctionalized
surfaces than for functionalized ones, which indicates a Wenzel wetting
regime for the former and a Cassie–Baxter regime for the last.
Besides that, the mass variation did not change significantly between
just after the sinking of the surface into water and after 16 h of
it, which indicates that there was no transition between the wetting
regimes during the period of the experiment. Variables that are present
during the scaling process, like ionic strength and nucleated sites
onto the surface, were also evaluated and presented also a Cassie–Baxter
wetting regime that does not change to Wenzel state during the test
period.

Figure 4 Mass variation per area unit and its standard deviation after sinking
of nonfunctionalized sample into deionized water (nF), functionalized
sample with PFDT into deionized water (PFDT), functionalized sample
into water with ionic strength 4 mol L–1 (I = 4), and functionalized sample after scaling test into
deionized water (Scaled).

With these results, it was possible to attest that the surperhydrophobic
sample that suffers much more scaling was in the Cassie–Baxter
wetting regime during all the scaling process and its low contact
area was not enough to prevent it. So, different from the results
found in works that test adhesion between already grown large particles
and the surface,1,13 we conclude that the larger contact
area is not decisive for scaling induction when regarding in situ
heterogeneous nucleation onto the surface. For nucleation to start,
only a seed is required, and it has a minimal size. The sharp structures
from the hierarchical topography of the surperhydrophobic surface
that provides a minimal contact area with the liquid phase when under
Cassie–Baxter wetting regime are in large number and work like
seeds for heterogeneous nucleation.32

The seeds provided by the surface topography under Cassie–Baxter
regime can explain why the inorganic scaling cannot be prevented but
cannot explain why it is increased when compared which superhydrophilic
Wenzel surface. For that, an energetic study of the interfaces was
performed.

The contact between the solid phase of the functionalized
and the
liquid should present a high energetic interface because the adhesion
work of water with perfluorocarbon is much lower than the water cohesion
work. To verify that, contact angle experiments were carried out to
evaluate the energetic changes at the interface caused by inorganic
scale.

Polyaniline electropolymerized over 180 s onto stainless
steel
316 was used in these contact angle experiments because of its much
flatter surface when compared to polyaniline electropolymerized for
600 s, as can be seen in Figure 5, and so, to avoid major errors in the interfacial
tensions evaluated. The results of contact angle measurements and
the interfacial tensions evaluated are shown in Table 1.

a The solid surfaces used were nonfunctionalized
polyaniline, polyaniline functionalized with PFDT, and calcite monocrystal.
The liquids used in contact angle measurements were water, ethylene
glycol, and diiodomethane.

It is possible to observe in the data from Table 1 that the calcite monocrystal has an interfacial
tension with water lesser than both polyaniline surfaces, functionalized
or not, which justifies the scale formation onto their surfaces. Furthermore,
the polyaniline functionalized with the perfluorocarbon chain presents
a significantly greater value of interface tension with water than
the nonfunctionalized surface.

Thereby, these interfaces exposed
to a supersaturated aqueous media
consist of an out-of-equilibrium system, which tends to reach a state
of lower energy. Scale formation onto high-energy interfaces can minimize
their energy and, consequently, the overall system’s energy.
For nonfunctionalized samples, the interface with aqueous medium is
less energetic than that for the functionalized ones, thus the scale
formation onto it is not so prominent.

Therefore, for the electropolymerized
polyaniline surfaces used
in this work the Cassie–Baxter effect that grants superhydrophobic
properties to surfaces cannot prevent inorganic fouling onto them.
Moreover, the low interaction of the water molecules with the functionalized
groups adsorbed onto the surface, allied to its hierarchical structure,
both responsible for the pronounced Cassie–Baxter effect, not
only failed to prevent scale formation but also increased it.

Conversely, for polyaniline lubricated surfaces, the functionalization
with thiol groups aimed to enhance the wettability of the surface
by Krytox. Thus, PFDT, with its perfluorocarbon chain, was used to
retain Krytox, which is a perfluorinated polyether, into the hollows
of the rough surface. It was expected that the oil would remain impregnated
into the rough surfaces even after exposure to the solution due to
its much more favorable interaction with the respective thiol chains
than with the aqueous solution.

It was expected that the Krytox
film formed onto the electropolymerized
polyaniline surfaces played a similar role of the air in that extreme
Cassie–Baxter effect observed in the superhydrophobic samples,
but filling not only the hollows of the hierarchical surface but also
covering its outermost surface with a liquid film, preventing the
aqueous solution to be in direct contact with the solid surface.33 Thus, because of the liquid nature of the lubricant
phase, even if nucleation of the crystals occurs in the water/oil
interface, they cannot adhere to a solid spot and then slide back
to the aqueous solution.

Assessing the lubricated samples by
optical reflectance microscopy
(Figure 6) and comparing
them with the nonlubricated surfaces, it is possible to see an effective
inorganic scaling prevention by the slippery surfaces.

Figure 6 Optical micrographs of
electropolymerized polyaniline functionalized
with PFDT (a) lubricated with Krytox GPL105 before scaling test, (b)
nonlubricated after scaling test, and (c) lubricated with Krytox GPL105
after scaling test.

In the micrograph of Figure 6c, it is possible
to see some protuberances on the topography
shape of the polyaniline surface under the thin layer of oil that
remains over it, filling the hollows interconnected through the polyaniline
structure. Nonetheless, the amount of oil remaining over the surface
after the scaling test was enough to prevent completely the inorganic
scaling during the period of test (16 h) as shown in Figure 6.

Conclusions
Electropolymerized
polyaniline was shown to be a good structure
model to test and understand the efficiency and stability of superhydrophobic
surfaces and the slippery ones against inorganic scaling medium.

Even though the superhydrophobic surfaces prepared with electropolymerized
polyaniline functionalized with thiol groups of low polarizability
present a great Cassie–Baxter effect that endures the entire
test time and seem nonwettable under contact angle experiments, they
did not prevent inorganic scaling. For heterogeneous nucleation to
take place, points of minimal contact area are enough to work as nucleation
seeds.

Nonetheless, the replacement of the air trapped in the
hollows
of the superhydrophobic surface by an oil of low polarizability that
interacts with the thiol groups leads to a situation where the oil
phase lies between the solid surface and the brine. Because it creates
a liquid/liquid interface, the inorganic crystals that are formed
in it are unable to find adhesion spots and slide back to the aqueous
solution. Thus, the solid surface remains protected by the oil layer
and inorganic scaling is efficiently prevented during the test period.

Therefore, these results suggest that the development of lubricated
slippery surfaces with inorganic antiscaling goal is a more promising
alternative than the lotus-like superhydrophobic self-cleaning surfaces.

Materials
The salts Na2SO4, NaCl,
KCl, CaCl2·2H2O, MgCl2·6H2O, BaCl2·2H2O, SrCl2·6H2O, NaHCO3, NaBr, and NaCH3COO (all PA-ACS), used to prepare the scaling medium, were purchased
from Synth Brazil. Sulfuric acid, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene
glycol (all PA-ACS) were also purchased from Synth Brazil. 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT, 97% purity) and diiodomethane (99% purity)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Brazil. Krytox GPL105 was purchased
from Chemours. Water used was always deionized (Milli-Q Plus Water
System, Millipore, 18.2 MΩ). Stainless steel 316 was used as
disks with 12.7 mm diameter and polished with 1600 mesh sandpaper.
A chrome/gold electrode for quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM Cr/Au),
with 25.4 mm diameter and gold exposed to surface, were purchased
from Maxtek. Aniline (99% purity) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Brazil and distilled twice before use and stocked in the dark under
nitrogen atmosphere and in the refrigerator prior to use.

Preparation
of Polyaniline Samples
The electropolymerization
of aniline was carried out in a three-electrode cell, in which a platinum
plate was used as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (6.0726.100 Metrohm)
as the reference electrode, and disks made of stainless steel 316
or EQCM Cr/Au as the working electrodes. The galvanostatic method
was used to grow the polyaniline onto the metallic surface, with the
current set at 1000 μA, using a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT128N potentiostat/galvanostat,
with the time of the electropolymerization reaction of 600 s for scaling
test samples and 180 s for contact angle samples.

For stainless
steel-316, the meniscus method was employed to guarantee that only
desirable surfaces were exposed to be coated by electropolymerized
polyaniline. One of the circular faces of the disk was exposed to
the solution, which consisted of aniline 4% (v/v) aqueous solution
in sulfuric acid for stainless steel 316 working electrode or chloride acid for EQCM Cr/Au,
both 1 mol L–1, at room temperature.

After
the electropolymerization reaction, the samples were rinsed
in deionized water, followed by ethanol to remove unbound oligomers,23 and left sunken in deionized water for 24 h
to reach equilibrium between the protonated state of polyaniline29 and the water, guaranteeing that contact angles
could be measured without the influence of protonation/deprotonation
reaction of the polyaniline by water contact. Some samples were rinsed
in a 1 mol L–1 ammonium hydroxide solution for 4
h to assess their doped state.

Topography Characterization
The morphology of the polyaniline
samples surfaces was assessed by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), carried out in a FEI Quanta FEG 250, using 15
kV of acceleration voltage.

Functionalization and Lubrication of the
Surfaces
Although
some samples were left nonfunctionalized and nonlubricated, other
samples were functionalized by PFDT, in a 5 mmol L–1 solution of the thiol in isopropyl alcohol for 24 h. Some of the
samples electropolymerized by 600 s onto stainless steel 316 and functionalized
were lubricated with Krytox GPL105 by the deposition of a droplet
of the oil onto the sample surface, which was impregnated by capillarity.

Contact Angle Measurements
Static contact angle measurements
between liquid (deionized water, ethylene glycol, or diiodomethane)
and the solid surface samples were taken with a Krüss EasyDrop
goniometer, using the Drop Shape Analysis 1 software. The volume of
the added droplets was 2 μL, at a 150 μL min–1 addition rate. Each droplet had its static contact angle measured
every 10 s for 60 s. The surface of each sample was tested at three
different points. Furthermore, as the major inorganic scale observed
in the studied systems are calcite crystals, a calcite monocrystal
{104} surface was also assessed by the same methodology.

Interfacial
Tension Evaluation
From contact angle experiments,
the surface tensions of the polyaniline electropolymerized for 180
s, both functionalized and nonfunctionalized, and the calcite monocrystal
were evaluate using the Van Oss, Chaudhury, and Good method34 1   2   3  where γL is the surface tension
of the liquid and γS is the surface tension of the
solid. The LW superscript is the Lifshitz–van der Waals component
of the surface tension and + and – superscripts are the acid
and basic components of the surface tension, respectively. The AB
superscript is the total acid basic contribution to the surface tension.
The contact angle measured is given by θ. To evaluate a solid
surface tension, one must measure the contacts angles between the
solid and three different liquids, and one of them must have a null
acid basic component, such as diiodomethane.35

From surface tensions, the interface tensions between surfaces
and water were evaluated by the Young’s equation36 4  where γSL is the interface
tension between solid and liquid.

The values of all liquid surface
tension components were obtained
from the literature.35

Inorganic Scaling
Tests
The inorganic scaling tests
were performed in highly saline aqueous medium that simulates the
composition of formation water found in oil wells as described by
Sousa et al.37 This composition was initially
separated into two brines, called brine I and brine II. The composition
of each of the brines is shown in Table 2. The mixture of both brines leads to a supersaturated
solution of calcium carbonate and barium and strontium sulfates that
triggers the precipitation process and scale formation.

The samples were submerged in brine I and then brine
II was added
in brine I at once in a method named jar test. All tests were done
with 60 mL of each brine and, after their conclusion, the samples
were carefully washed with deionized water.

All the samples
used in inorganic scaling tests were electropolymerized
onto stainless steel disks for 600 s and disposed vertically for the
jar test. All nonlubricated samples were tested together in the same
jar, whereas the lubricated ones were tested together in another jar.
All these tests were carried out at room temperature and lasted for
16 h.

All samples were assessed by optical reflectance microscopy,
with
a Microtonal microscope, after the scaling test. The nonlubricated
samples scaling results were also assessed by FESEM.

Wetting State
Assessment
The wetting state profile
of electropolymerized polyaniline was assessed by measurements of
mass variation during the sinking of samples into aqueous solutions
and was carried out on a QCM200 Crystal Quartz Microbalance, 5 MHz,
Stanford Research Systems. For such purpose, polyaniline samples prepared
onto EQCM Cr/Au for 600 s of electropolymerization were utilized.
The measurements start with the dry sample followed by its instant
sinking into 60 mL of liquid. The mass variation was registered at
each 10 s for 16 h.

The tests were conducted with nonfunctionalized
samples sunken into water and functionalized ones sunken into water
or an aqueous solution of NaCl with the ionic strength of 4 mol L–1. The test with water was also conducted with functionalized
samples after exposure to the inorganic scaling test. All these tests
were carried out at room temperature without stirring.
