Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-supported
bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) (RGO–BFO) nanocomposite
is synthesized via a two-step
chemical route for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and
photocatalytic dye degradation. The detailed structural analysis,
chemical coupling, and morphology of BFO- and RGO-supported BFO are
established through X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
studies. The modified band structure in RGO–BFO is obtained
from the UV–vis spectroscopy study and supported by density
functional theory (DFT). The photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine
B dye achieved under 120 min visible-light illumination is 94% by
the RGO–BFO composite with a degradation rate of 1.86 ×
10–2 min–1, which is 3.8 times
faster than the BFO nanoparticles. The chemical oxygen demand (COD)
study further confirmed the mineralization of an organic dye in presence
of the RGO–BFO catalyst. The RGO–BFO composite shows
excellent PEC performance toward water splitting, with a photocurrent
density of 10.2 mA·cm–2, a solar-to-hydrogen
conversion efficiency of 3.3%, and a hole injection efficiency of
98% at 1 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The enhanced catalytic activity of RGO–BFO
is explained on the basis of the modified band structure and chemical
coupling between BFO and RGO, leading to the fast charge transport
through the interfacial layers, hindering the recombination of the
photogenerated electron–hole pair and ensuring the availability
of free charge carriers to assist the catalytic activity.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting, utilizing a semiconductor
nanoparticle as the catalyst to produce hydrogen and oxygen, has attracted
considerable attention over the past few decades.1−10 Hydrogen generation from water splitting11 has the following advantages: (1) reasonable solar-to-hydrogen (STH)
efficiency; (2) low processing cost; and (3) the ability to achieve
separate hydrogen and oxygen evolution during the reaction. Photocatalysts
facilitate the water-splitting reaction through the formation of an
electron (e–) and hole (h+) pair under
solar light irradiation, which oxidizes water on the surface of the
photocatalyst unless they recombine giving no net chemical reaction.
The holes and electrons in the PEC process can degrade the dye in
the presence of water.12 TiO2 is considered as the most promising photocatalyst for water splitting
to generate hydrogen under the irradiation of sunlight.13 However, the quantum efficiency of the TiO2-based photocatalyst is restricted because of its large band
gap (∼3.2 eV) and consequently limited absorption of visible
light. Several techniques including doping, metal decoration, and
formation of metal oxide complexes and heterostructures13−18 have been employed to achieve improved photocatalytic activity by
hindering the charge recombination process with improved charge-transfer
kinetics and photoactive to visible light.

Bismuth ferrite possessing
the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic
property simultaneously has drawn much attention recently in solar
applications because of the bulk photovoltaic effect where the photocurrent
can flow uniformly throughout the material without the formation of
an interface.19 In a ferroelectric material,
the photocurrent arises because of depolarization of the electric
field, which can separate the photogenerated charged carriers and
consequently restrict the electron–hole recombination loss
as in conventional semiconductors. Bismuth ferrite shows potential
photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of organic contaminants
and PEC water splitting because of its narrow band gap of ∼2.1–2.7
eV.1,20−22 The narrow band gap
favors the extension of light absorption region up to 750 nm and charge
carrier separation.23 In particular, it
has three crystalline phases: BiFeO3 (perovskite), Bi2Fe4O9 (sillimanite), and Bi25Fe2O39 (sillenite). The sillimanite and sillenite
phases are paramagnetic and superparamagnetic, respectively, and extensively
studied for their application toward the decomposition of organic
contaminants with feasible catalyst separation and recovery.1,22,24 Although BiFeO3 (BFO)
is considered as the most promising multiferroic material at room
temperature, its single phase synthesis is quite challenging.25−28

The photocatalytic performance of BFO is scanty and needs
attention
toward the development of a multifunctional material. Some recent
studies show that the catalytic performance of BFO can be improved
by forming a heterojunction with the aim of suppression of charge
recombination.29,30 For instance, Li et al.31 reported that the BFO/TiO2 heterojunction
could enhance the photocatalytic activity and quantum efficiency than
bare BFO because of the enhancement of the quantum efficiency by separating
the electrons and holes effectively and degrade Congo red under visible-light
illumination. Recently, Kong et al.23 reported
that the BFO–(Bi/Fe)2O3 heterojunction
is 2.5 times more active than BFO toward visible-light decomposition
of gaseous toluene under similar test conditions. The superior activity
is due to the reduced recombination probability, the increased lifetime
of the charge carriers, and a superior interfacial charge transfer
to adsorbed organic molecules. There is further scope for the improvement
of the charge migration with inhibited charge recombination of BFO
by suitably choosing a supporting material.

The high surface
area, excellent electrical conductivity, and high
charge carrier mobility in graphene make it an efficient and suitable
candidate as an electron acceptor to mitigate the recombination of
photogenerated electrons and holes during the photocatalytic reaction.
For instance, Soltani et al.32 reported
improved decomposition of bisphenol A under visible light by the BFO/reduced
graphene oxide (RGO) composite. Also, Xian et al.33 reported the graphene-assisted photocatalytic activity
enhancement of Bi2Fe4O9 (sillimanite)
nanoparticles. On the other hand, Sun et al.24 studied the degradation of methylene blue under visible-light irradiation
in Bi25FeO40 (sillenite)–graphene composite.
Li et al.34 found out that the photodegradation
of Congo red under visible light is 6 times higher in graphene-supported
BFO than in BFO alone. In the context of water splitting, Joshi et
al.35 studied the half-cell performance
of BFO nanocubes and observed a low photocurrent density of 5.2 μA·cm–2 at 1 V (vs saturated caromel electrode) for O2 evaluation. Similarly, Gao et al.36 reported that BFO nanowires were unable to produce H2 either from pure water or from Pt/CH3OH/H2O solution under visible-light irradiation and UV irradiation. The
poor PEC water-splitting performance in BFO is due to excessive electron–hole
recombination, reduced charge transport, large particle aggregation,
and poor water oxidation kinetics.

Therefore, further improvement
in the performance is desired for
practical applications of BFO for water splitting. Toward this end,
suitable heterojunction between BFO and RGO is established by the
uniform dispersion of BFO nanoparticles onto the RGO sheet, which
not only prevents particle agglomeration but suppresses the electron–hole
recombination and also favors facile charge transport through a suitable
band alignment. Also, the photogenerated electrons can be readily
transferred through the graphene which acts as an electron acceptor;
thus, more photogenerated electrons and holes are available for the
photocatalytic reactions. A photochemical reaction scheme is further
proposed toward water splitting for BFO, which is not reported earlier.

Herein, a facile chemical route has been adopted for decorating
the RGO sheet with BFO nanoparticles for PEC water splitting. The
RGO–BFO nanocomposite is obtained by reducing the exfoliated
graphene oxide (GO) in the presence of BFO nanoparticles. The catalytic
degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light illumination
exhibited improved charge-transport properties, leading to a remarkable
enhancement in visible-light response. The electrochemical measurements
suggest that the RGO–BFO nanocomposite gives better performance
than BFO nanoparticles toward STH generation and hole injection efficiency
in visible light. The improved performance is discussed on the basis
of physical characteristics of the RGO–BFO nanocomposite, generation
of charge carriers, extension of light absorption region, density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, and suppression of charge carrier
recombination.

Results and Discussion
The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of BFO calcined at different
temperatures is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). It is observed that the samples calcined at 500
and 600 °C contain different phases (Bi2Fe4O9 and Bi25Fe2O39) than
BFO. However, the sample calcined at 400 °C is in pure BFO phase
and considered for the composite formation with RGO. Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern of
BFO calcined at 400 °C and the RGO–BFO composite. The
pattern reveals a well-crystalline rhombohedral phase with a space
group R3c (JCPDS no. 86-1518). The
intensity of diffraction peaks decreases in RGO–BFO than in
BFO nanoparticles confirming the composite formation. The detailed
structural analysis is done using the Rietveld refinement method with
the help of Maud software. The structural parameters (lattice parameter,
atomic coordinates, and occupancy) and microstructural parameters
(crystallite size and lattice strain) are estimated by analyzing the
respective XRD pattern. The Rietveld refined XRD pattern of BFO and
RGO–BFO is shown in Figure 1b,c, respectively. The difference between the observed
and refined XRD pattern is shown by the lower green line. The refinement
is done using the trigonal space group R3c with lattice constants a = 0.55876 nm, b = 0.55876 nm, and c = 1.3867 nm. The
line broadening is fitted by refining the structural and microstructural
pattern, and the background of each pattern is fitted with a four-degree
polynomial. The line broadening and size–strain model are chosen
to be Popa LB and Popa rules during the refinement. The refinement
of the structural parameters is continued till the convergence is
reached with the goodness of fit ∼1, which ascertain excellent
fitting quality. The pseudo-Voigt (pV) X-ray line shape and the Gaussian
microstrain distribution are the normalized Fourier transform of the
pV function used for profile fitting to estimate the crystallite size
and lattice strain. The bond length and bond angle are estimated using
the Mercury 3.1 with the help of Rietveld refined parameters and rhombohedral
cage of BFO (Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information). The different refinement parameters are enlisted in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The estimated values
of the lattice parameter, microstrain, crystallite size, bond length,
and bond angle for RGO–BFO are comparable to that for BFO.
The small difference arises because of the coordination of lattice
oxygen with RGO, which locally distorts the lattice of BFO and plays
a significant role in optical and electrochemical properties. The
Raman scattering is considered as a valuable and important technique
to study the local structure of BFO and the RGO–BFO composite.
The Raman spectra of BFO nanoparticles and the RGO–BFO composite
are shown in Figure 1d. The Raman active modes of BFO with the rhombohedral structure
and R3c space group are obtained
using the irreducible space group, ΓRaman, R3c = 4A1 + 9E.37 The A1 modes are polarized
along the z-axis, and the doubly degenerate E modes are polarized in the x–y plane. The computed frequencies of the transverse optic
and longitudinal optic modes of A1 and E symmetry are provided in the Supporting Information (Table S2). The modes up to 167 cm–1 are due to
Bi atoms and Fe atoms that are mainly involved in bands between 168
and 261 cm–1 and also due to some higher frequency
bands, while oxygen motion is involved in bands above 262 cm–1.38 Thus, the modes located above 200
cm–1 are due to the internal vibration of FeO6 octahedral. In the present study, 11 peaks due to 4A1 + 7E modes are observed for the BFO nanoparticle. Similar
kind of observation is reported by Yuan et al. for BFO with 10 Raman
modes.39 However, in the case of RGO–BFO,
only eight peaks due to 2A1 + 6E modes are observed. We
could not observe all the Raman modes of rhombohedral BFO (R3c) in the RGO–BFO sample. The
suppression of Raman modes is ascribed to the influence of oxygen
stoichiometry and change in oxygen bonding.40 The D band and the G band for GO are located at 1350 and 1580 cm–1, respectively.41 Clearly,
the D/G intensity ratio of RGO in RGO–BFO (1.2) is higher than
that of GO (0.95) because of restoration and decrease in the average
size of sp2-hybridized carbon during the reduction reaction.42 In our case, the Raman modes for D and G bands
for RGO–BFO are positioned at 1352 and 1596 cm–1, respectively. The observed blue shift confirms the reduction of
GO to RGO.43

and RGO–BFO, (b) Rietveld refined
pattern of BFO, (c) Rietveld refined pattern of RGO–BFO, and

Figure 2a
shows
the bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of BFO.
The particles are identical in shape with a slight deviation from
the spherical symmetry. The particle size and standard deviation are
estimated from log-normal distribution function as given in eq 1, and they are presented
in Figure 2b. 1  where μ is the particle size
and σ
is the standard deviation. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of
BFO nanoparticles is shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The (101) and (110) diffraction planes match
with the BFO phase (JCPDS no. 86-1815). The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information) with the distinct rings, suggesting
the polycrystalline nature of the sample. The rings are indexed, which
match with BFO. Figure 2c shows the TEM image of the RGO–BFO composite. The BFO nanoparticles
are uniformly distributed and are entrenched within the thin layer
of RGO. It is clearly seen in Figure 2c that the BFO nanoparticles do not lose contact with
RGO even after the rigorous ultrasonication during TEM sample preparation,
confirming the excellent attachment between BFO and RGO. The thin
graphene sheet and BFO nanoparticles are semitransparent to the electron
beam. Such an architecture is advantageous because it favors easy
and facile charge transfer through the graphene sheet during the PEC
process.

(a), (c) TEM image of RGO–BFO, and (d) SAED pattern of RGO–BFO.

The particle size of BFO within
the composite is similar to that
of pure BFO sample, suggesting that no aggregation has taken place.
Also, wrinkles are observed on the RGO sheet, confirming the ultrathin
layer of the RGO sheet. The SAED pattern of RGO–BFO is shown
in Figure 2d. The pattern
matches with BFO and corroborates with the XRD study.

The chemical
state of the elements of the as-prepared BFO and RGO–BFO
measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is given in Figure 3a,d. The strong signal
from the Bi 4f core-level spectrum with maxima corresponding to Bi
4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 is positioned at 163.5 and
158.1 eV, respectively, in BFO and at 163.7 and 158.7 eV, respectively,
in RGO–BFO, as shown in Figure 3a. There is no trace of metallic Bi0 4f
core level and Bi2+ 4f core level, indicating the presence
of only the Bi3+ state. As compared to BFO, the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 peaks for RGO–BFO are shifted
by 0.2 and 0.6 eV, respectively, toward higher energy state. The XPS
signal from the Fe 2p core-level spectra in BFO and RGO–BFO
is presented in Figure 3b.

The peaks at binding energies
713.2 and 727.1 eV for BFO and 713.6
and 727.2 eV for RGO–BFO represent Fe 2p3/2 and
Fe 2p1/2 of Fe3+, respectively, arising from
the spin–orbit interaction. Furthermore, the position of the
satellite peak in the Fe 2p spectra is in good agreement with the
Fe3+ oxidation state in BFO.44 Also, the Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks for
RGO–BFO are shifted by 0.1 and 0.5 eV, respectively. The red
shift suggests a certain electronic interaction between BFO nanoparticles
and the RGO sheet.45 The binding energy
of O 1s in BFO nanoparticles emerges at 530.2 and 531.2 eV corresponding
to the lattice oxygen of Fe–O and Bi–O bonds, respectively,
shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). The O 1s spectra of RGO–BFO are deconvoluted into four
signature peaks corresponding to Fe–O, Bi–O, C=O,
and C–O, as shown in Figure 3c. The Fe–O and Bi–O bonds are positioned
at 529.9 and 530.8 eV, respectively. The lattice oxygen bonds of metals
are slightly decreased toward lower binding energy in RGO–BFO
compared to that in BFO, which might be due to the electronic interaction
between the RGO sheet and the BFO nanoparticle and formation of Fe–O–C
and Bi–O–C bonds, which in turn confirm the high degree
of attachment between BFO and the RGO sheet. The binding energy components
positioned at 532.3 eV (C=O) and 533.6 eV (C–O) are
ascribed to the residual oxygen-containing groups in RGO.46 The C 1s peak of RGO–BFO is deconvoluted
into four peaks, as shown in Figure 3d. The four peaks are ascribed to the nonoxygenated
C–C bond, hydroxyl C–H bond, epoxy C–O bond,
and C=O bond positioned at 284.8, 286.1, 287.8, and 289 eV,
respectively.32 The strong C 1s peak (284.8
eV) is related to graphitic carbon in graphene and the weaker peaks
arise from the oxygenated species, confirming that a certain degree
of deoxygenation process accompanies the reduction of GO.47 Further confirmation of the role of RGO on BFO
nanoparticles is conferred from UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 4a). The room-temperature
optical absorption spectra in the range 250–800 nm for BFO
and RGO–BFO are shown in Figure 4a. The absorption spectra show that broad and strong
spectra in the 500–600 nm range are ascribed to the band gap
absorption. As the BFO nanoparticles are anchored onto the RGO sheet,
a red shift is observed in the RGO–BFO composite, suggesting
a decrease in band gap energy. The optical band gap energy from the
absorption spectra is calculated using the Tauc relation, given as
αhν = A(hν – Eg)n, where h is Planck’s constant, α
is the absorption coefficient, Eg is the
optical energy gap, and A is the constant, for direct
transitions n = 1/2. The extrapolation of the straight
line to (αhν)2 = 0 axis in
Figure S6 (Supporting Information) gives Eg. The band gaps for BFO and RGO–BFO
are found to be 2.25 and 1.85 eV, respectively, and are in agreement
with the previous report on BFO.48 The
decrease in band gap supports certain electronic interaction between
BFO nanoparticles and the RGO sheet. The RGO contributes to the tuning
of the band gap in the RGO–BFO nanocomposite. The room-temperature
photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra (excitation wavelength 514
nm) of BFO and RGO–BFO are shown in Figure 4b. The PL spectra of BFO show a strong emission,
suggesting a high electron–hole recombination rate, whereas
in RGO–BFO, the weak emission spectra indicate the slow rate
of electron–hole recombination. Further, the geometrically
optimized lattice structure of pure RGO, BFO, and combined RGO–BFO
is illustrated in Figure 5. After the geometry relaxation of RGO–BFO, a slight
lattice distortion was observed (as shown in Figure 5c), which is also observed from the XRD study.
The result indicates the existence of a strong interaction between
RGO and BFO. The equilibrium interlayer distance between the two slabs
of RGO and BFO is 3.347 Å, which is in close agreement with the
earlier reported distance of 2.790 Å.49 In order to understand the electronic properties of the composite
structure of RGO–BFO, the total density of states (DOSs) are
calculated for each individual structure (RGO and BFO) as well as
the combined structure of RGO–BFO (Figure 6). A Fermi level is chosen as the reference
state of energy. The DOS of the RGO lattice, illustrated in Figure 6a, suggests an overlap
of valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB), which leads to a zero
band gap in pure RGO, similar to previous reports.50,51 Moitra et al.49 reported that all contributions
in RGO arise from C 2s and C 2p states. They further observed that
for pure BFO, the VB is constituted of O 2p and Fe 3d states, whereas
the CB is constituted of Bi 6p states. The hybridization between Fe
3d and O 2p states is attributed to the overlap of these states. The
calculated band gap is 2.5 eV (Figure 2b) for BFO, which is consistent with the experimentally
measured optical band gap (2.25 eV). As the BFO lattice structure
is composited with the RGO superlattice, new bands appear in the gap
region near the Fermi level (Figure 6c) originating from C 2p states of graphene. The appearance
of the new bands leading to the reduction of the calculated band gap
of RGO–BFO to 1.5 eV is due to the hybridization between C
2p states of graphene and O 2p and Fe 3d states of BFO,49 which is also consistent with the experimental
results (1.85 eV). The result clearly indicates the effect of RGO
on the electronic properties of BFO. Therefore, on the basis of these
calculations, we can observe an improved electronic conductivity and
an electrocatalytic activity of RGO–BFO for the electrochemical
reduction of H2O.

zero energy states.

The photocatalytic performance
of BFO and RGO–BFO evaluated
by the decomposition of RhB under visible-light illumination is shown
in Figure S7a (Supporting Information).
The degradation rate of RhB is 4% even after the illumination of 120
min without the catalyst, indicating an excellent stability of RhB.
However, the degradation rate of RhB reaches up to 10% for RGO, 56%
for BFO, and 91% for RGO–BFO after illumination of 120 min
as shown in Figure S7b (Supporting Information), which is consistent with previous reports. For instance, Guo et
al.29 reported 94% degradation of RhB after
illumination of 120 min in 10 wt % Gd-doped BFO. The complete degradation
of bisphenol A and 78% degradation of total organic carbon are achieved
in the RGO–BFO composite.32 Further,
75 and 71% degradation of Congo red is reported in the RGO–BFO
hybrid system under visible-light illumination of 120 min with the
rate constant varying from 0.96 × 10–2 to 1.8
× 10–2 min–1.34,52

The degradation rate of RhB is estimated by the pseudo-first-order
rate kinetics, which can be described from equations  and , where C0 is
the initial concentration of RhB after stirring the solution for 60
min, Ct is the RhB concentration
at illumination time t, and kobs is the observed pseudo-order rate constant. The linear
relationship between ln(C0/Ct) versus illumination time (t) is shown in Figure S7c (Supporting Information). The observed rate constant for RGO–BFO
(1.86 × 10–2 min–1) is higher
than that for BFO (7.18 × 10–3 min–1) and similar to others34,52 confirming superior
photoactivity of RGO–BFO.

As the BFO nanoparticles are
embedded within the RGO sheet, the
adsorption of RhB can be preceded through the surface of BFO nanoparticles
or via the surface of the RGO sheet. However, the latter is much more
favorable because of the presence of giant π-conjugational plane
in RGO, which interacts strongly with the RhB molecule through π–π
stacking with a face-to-face orientation.53,54 The enhanced photocatalytic activity in RGO–BFO is explained
on the basis of charge transfer between BFO, RGO, RhB, and excited
RhB (RhB*). The band edge positions of RGO–BFO are shown in
Figure S7d (Supporting Information). The
RGO is an excellent electron mediator facilitating the electron transfer
between RhB* and BFO. RhB* can efficiently transfer the electron to
the RGO plane at a much faster rate than BFO. However, because of
the electron recombination between the transferred electron and surface-adsorbed
RhB+, the degradation rate of RhB over the RGO surface
is delayed (shown by a dashed arrow). As the BFO nanoparticles are
embedded into the RGO sheet, the excited electron moves to the CB
of BFO from RGO prior to recombination. The electrons on the surface
of BFO can also be trapped by various oxygenated species, thus delaying
the recombination further and enhancing the photocatalytic activity
toward the degradation of RhB. The performance of different BFO catalysts
toward the degradation of various contaminants is enlisted in Table
S3 (Supporting Information).

The
complete degradation of the RhB dye is associated with the
decolorization of the dye as well as mineralization of the organic
compound of the dye. In order to get a deep insight about the mineralization
of the dye, the irradiated sample with regular time interval is analyzed
by the chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurement shown in Figure S8
(Supporting Information). The study demonstrates
that 95% of the COD value is reduced after 120 min visible-light illumination
for the RGO–BFO composite, whereas it is about 45% for BFO
and 21% in the absence of any catalyst. The residual 5% COD value
is within the acceptable limit of COD governed by world health organization
(WHO). The study extends the dye degradation efficiency of the RGO–BFO
composite without the formation of any harmful element during the
degradation process. The performance of RGO–BFO in the present
study shows superior activity toward the degradation of RhB in terms
of low catalyst concentration and high degradation rate.

The
main emphasis of the present study is to establish the effectiveness
of the BFO–RGO composite photoanode toward water splitting
in the KOH electrolyte. The PEC water-splitting performance of the
BFO nanoparticle and RGO–BFO nanocomposite is evaluated by
measuring the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under dark and visible-light
illumination conditions with a xenon lamp of intensity 100 mW·cm–2. The current density obtained under illuminated condition
is significantly higher than that under dark condition for both BFO
and RGO–BFO. The photocurrent density is calculated by subtracting
the dark current from the light current and divided by the electrode
area and plotted against the applied potential as shown in Figure 7a. The PEC performance
of the RGO–BFO composite shows significant improvement as compared
to the BFO nanoparticles in terms of lower onset potential and higher
photocurrent density. The photocurrent onset potential of BFO is found
to be 0.41 V (vs Ag/AgCl), which is shifted slightly toward lower
potential (0.35 V (vs Ag/AgCl)) in the case of RGO–BFO. The
photocurrent density for RGO–BFO is 10.2 mA·cm–2 at the applied potential of 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl), which is much higher
than that for BFO. The higher photocurrent density is attributed to
the interfacial charge transfer with inhibited electron–hole
recombination, which improves the water-splitting efficiency effectively.
Further, the STH conversion efficiency for the water-splitting reaction
under the visible-light irradiation of 100 mW·cm–2 is calculated using eq 2(55) 2  where Jp is the
photocurrent density (mA·cm–2) at the applied
bias, I0 is the incident light intensity
of 100 mW cm–2, and Vapp is the applied potential to the PEC cell with reference to standard
hydrogen electrode (vs SHE) potential. Again, Vapp = Vmea – Vaoc, where Vmea is the electrode
potential (vs SHE) of the working electrode at which the photocurrent
is measured under illumination and Vaoc is the electrode potential (vs SHE) at open-circuit condition under
the same illumination conditions in the KOH electrolyte. The variation
of η (%) has been plotted with the applied potential (V vs Ag/AgCl)
as shown in Figure 7b. The maximum values of the STH efficiency are ∼3.3 and 0.75%
at 0.21 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the RGO–BFO composite and BFO nanoparticles,
respectively. The performance of various catalysts toward the PEC
water splitting is enlisted in Table S4 (Supporting Information). For instance, Singh et al.56 reported 2.87% STH efficiency in the BiVO4/TiO2 heterostructure. The STH efficiencies of 0.55% and 0.17%
are observed for CaFe2O4–TaON57 and Fe2O3/RGO/BiV1–xMoxO4, respectively.58 Bhandary et al.59 reported 0.85% STH efficiency in α-Fe2O3–NiMnOx, whereas
Chen et al.60 reported 0.08% STH efficiency
in Ti/Fe2O3. Recently, we have reported significantly
improved STH of 3.08% in the ternary composite of RGO–MoS2-supported NiCo2O4.61 In light of above observations, it endows with great evidence
that RGO–BFO is an excellent candidate for PEC water splitting
with excellent STH efficiency. The pronounced photocatalytic activity
implies that the presence of the RGO sheet plays a crucial role in
enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of the RGO–BFO composite.
Further, the strong hybridization between C 2p states of graphene
and O 2p and Fe 3d states of BFO significantly increases the electrical
conductivity of RGO–BFO.62 The rationale
of hybridizing BFO nanoparticles with the RGO sheet lies in the high
charge carrier mobility of RGO. The enhancement in photocurrent density
and STH conversion efficiency is explained on the basis of suppression
of photogenerated electron–hole pair recombination. The chemical
and electronic coupling between BFO and the RGO sheet as supported
from XRD, XPS, and DFT studies plays a crucial role in the suppression
of charge carrier recombination. The charge-transfer process is studied
by measuring the charge injection efficiency at the electrode/electrolyte
interfaces, estimated from the hole-scavenger measurements which regulate
the ratio of the holes at the electrode/electrolyte interface injected
into the electrolyte without electron–hole recombination.63,64 The charge injection efficiency is estimated by adding H2O2 as the hole scavenger in the electrolyte and calculated
from the relation ηinj = jph (H2O)/jph (H2O2), where jph (H2O)
and jph (H2O2) are
the light-illuminated current densities without and with hole scavengers,
respectively. The LSV curve in 1 M KOH and with and without H2O2 is shown in Figure 7c. The injection efficiency for RGO–BFO
is 98% at 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) (Figure 7d), suggesting inhibited charge recombination at the
interfaces which accelerate the water oxidation kinetics and improves
the PEC activity, whereas the injection efficiency for BFO is 68%
at 0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) (Figure 7d), indicating slow kinetics of oxygen evolution and poor
PEC activity as compared to RGO–BFO. The photocurrent response
of BFO and RGO–BFO is recorded under light on/off condition
periodically at 100 s interval at the applied bias of 0.21 V (vs Ag/AgCl),
as shown in Figure 8a. The photocurrent density of RGO–BFO is much higher than
that of BFO and is highly reproducible under light on/off condition
demonstrating excellent stability. The stability of BFO and RGO–BFO
under light illumination is further studied by the chronoamperometry
(CA) measurement. The measurement is done at an applied potential
of 0.21 V (vs Ag/AgCl), as shown in Figure 8b. Initially, the photocurrent density shows
a higher value for both the catalysts, but after a few seconds, it
attains a steady value and becomes stable during the remaining part
of the measurement. Consequently, the higher and stable photocurrent
density with long-term stability makes RGO–BFO a promising
photocatalyst toward PEC water splitting.

Figure 9 schematically
depicts the possible reaction mechanism responsible for the enhanced
photoelectrocatalytic activity in the RGO–BFO composite. The
CB and VB potentials at the point of zero charge are estimated from
the DFT study using eqs 3a and 3b, as given in the following: 3a   3b  where ECB and EVB are the CB and VB edge potential, respectively. X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, which is
the geometric mean of the electronegativity of the constituent atoms. Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen
scale (4.5 eV), and Eg is the band gap
energy of the semiconductor. When BFO is irradiated by light with
sufficient energy (>2.5 eV), the photogenerated electrons (e–) at the lower energy state would get excited and jump
over to the
higher energy state keeping the photogenerated holes (h+) at the lower energy state. Due to the short lifetime of the photogenerated
electrons at higher energy state, it comes down to the lower energy
state and recombine with the photogenerated holes quickly, which results
in fewer participation of electrons and holes in the photoelectrocatalytic
reaction, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of BFO. However,
when the BFO nanoparticles are embedded within the RGO sheet, the
electronic interaction between BFO and RGO (XRD and XPS study) causes
a shift in the CB edge, which decreases the band gap of RGO–BFO
compared to BFO (UV–vis spectra, DFT study), facilitating the
generation of excitons at lower energy. Further, the favorable pathway
for the transport of photoinduced electrons from the CB of BFO to
RGO increases the charge carrier concentration by hindering the recombination
significantly as supported by the PL study.

Figure 9 Schematic representation
of the proposed mechanism of photocatalysis
of BFO and RGO–BFO.

The flat band potential, VFB,
of BFO
and RGO–BFO is estimated by the Mott–Schottky (MS) measurement
using eq 4(65,66) 4  where ε is the dielectric constant,
ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, ND is the donor density, Vapp is the applied potential, and kT/q is a constant
at room temperature. The intercept of the linear plot at 1/C2 = 0 gives the flat band potential. Figure 10a,b shows the MS plot for BFO and RGO–BFO,
respectively. The positive slope revealed that both the samples possess
n-type conductivity. The VFB estimated
from eq 4 is −0.56
V (vs Ag/AgCl) for RGO–BFO and −0.43 V (vs Ag/AgCl)
for BFO.

Figure 10 MS plot for (a) BFO and (b) RGO–BFO measured in 1 M KOH
solution.

In RGO–BFO, the VFB (−0.56
V (vs Ag/AgCl)) shifted toward more negative potential than that of
BFO (−0.43 V (vs Ag/AgCl)). In a recent study on BiVO4, Singh et al.67 reported improved electrocatalytic
activity by creating interband states in BiVO4 and obtained
more negative VFB. The flat band potential
shifting in the case of RGO–BFO is quite impressive with respect
to the charge-transfer kinetics. When BFO (n type) and RGO–BFO
(n-type) come in contact with the redox electrolyte, which has a redox
Fermi level lying below the Fermi level of both BFO and RGO–BFO,
the photoinduced electron diffuses through the oxidized species of
the electrolyte until the equilibrium is reached. The transfer of
mobile charge carrier or the trapping of charge carriers at surface
states at the interface leads to the formation of a space-charge-limited
(SCL) region. The SCL region formed is called the depletion layer,
and the bands bend upward toward the surface. The band bending arises
because of the equilibration of two Fermi levels and is determined
by the separation between the Fermi levels of RGO and the RGO–BFO
catalyst and the electrolyte, as shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information). The CB edge and VB edge potential
of both the catalysts suggests larger band bending with the increase
in SCL region in RGO–BFO than that in BFO. The increase in
the SCL region width and hence more negative value of VFB effectively increase the charge carrier concentration
that is separated and, therefore, has the potential to increase the
photoelectrocatalytic activity, leading to higher STH conversion efficiency.
The impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) for BFO and RGO–BFO are
shown in Figure 11. The RGO–BFO composite has lower interfacial charge-transfer
resistance than BFO nanoparticles, suggesting a faster electron-transfer
kinetics favorable to enhanced charge carrier separation at the interface,
leading to better PEC efficiency.

Conclusions
A
two-step chemical route is employed to synthesize BFO nanoparticles
decorated onto the RGO sheet with a well-crystallized rhombohedral
phase for BFO nanoparticles having an average diameter of 22.5 nm,
which is established from the XRD and TEM study. The suppression of
few Raman modes with the intensity ratio of D and G bands (>1)
reveals
the change in oxygen bonding and reduction of GO in the RGO–BFO
composite. The electronic interaction between BFO and RGO is guided
through the formation of Fe–O–C and Bi–O–C
bonds as observed from the XPS study, which leads to the modification
in band edge positions, and a subsequent decrease in the band gap
of RGO–BFO than that of BFO, which is further confirmed from
UV–vis and DFT studies. The modified band structure exhibits
slow electron–hole recombination as reflected in the PL study
and Nyquist plot. The photocatalytic degradation of RhB dye (94%)
under the illumination of 120 min with a rate constant of 1.86 ×
10–2 min–1, which is 3.8 times
faster than that of bare BFO, further established the efficiency of
the RGO–BFO photocatalyst. The COD measurement confirmed mineralization
of the organic dye in presence of the RGO–BFO photocatalyst.
The remarkable improvement in the PEC performance of the RGO–BFO
composite is observed in terms of photocurrent density (10.2 mA·cm–2), STH (3.3%), and hole injection efficiency (98%)
at 1 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The modified band edge position of BFO in the
presence of highly conducting RGO sheet favors excellent charge transport,
suppresses the recombination, and leads to the higher photocatalytic
activity and excellent stability in the RGO–BFO composite toward
photoelectrocatalytic water splitting compared to that available in
the literature.

Experimental Section
Sample Preparation
BFO nanoparticles were prepared
according to the modified Pechini method.68 Typically, an equimolar (0.015 M) amount of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate
and iron nitrate nonahydrate was added successively to 30 mL ethylene
glycol (EG) under vigorous stirring. The mixture became transparent
upon evaporation of excess EG at 80 °C. Then, few drops of HNO3 (69%) was added to the above solution to maintain at pH ≈
1. Tartaric acid of 0.03 M was added to the solution as a complexing
agent. The solution was heated at 130 °C to obtain the polyester
precursor powder. The dry powder was calcined at 400, 500, and 600
°C for 1 h to obtain the desired phase.

In order to introduce
the BFO nanoparticles into the RGO sheet, 40 mg of BFO nanoparticle
and 40 mg of GO, prepared according to modified Hummer’s method,
were mixed with 100 mL ultrapure water under ultrasonic irradiation
(30 ± 3 kHz) in a bath for 40 h at 40 °C. One milliliter
of hydrazine hydrate was added to the solution as the reducing agent.
The final solution was dried on a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 h
and collected by centrifugation. Finally, the sample was dried overnight
at 50 °C.

Material Characterization
The formation
of the BFO
phase and the RGO–BFO composite was confirmed by the XRD study.
The X-ray scan of the samples was recorded by a Rigaku Miniflex 600
X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation
operated at 40 mA and 40 kV at a scanning rate of 0.02° s–1 in the 2θ range of 10°–80°.
The HRTEM study was done to estimate the particle size and shape,
crystallinity, and attachment of BFO to RGO. The TEM images were taken
using an FEI-Technai-G20 instrument at an accelerating voltage of
200 kV. The sample for the TEM study was prepared by grinding with
an agate mortar and dispersing ultrasonically in water in order to
ensure maximum dispersion of the samples. One drop of the dispersion
was cast on a 300-mesh Cu grid, coated with a lacy carbon film to
avoid agglomeration of the samples on the grid. The sample was then
dried overnight at room temperature prior to HRTEM measurement. To
study the local structure within the sample, Raman analysis was done
on an inVia Raman microscope under excitation by 514 nm argon ion
laser pulse from 100 to 1800 cm–1. To understand
the optical behavior of the samples, the measurements were carried
out using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda
35) and a PL spectrophotometer (Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer
(F-2500)) in the wavelength range 250–800 nm. An XPS study
was carried out to determine the various oxidation states of BFO and
RGO–BFO. A Thermo VG Scientific Theta Probe (VG Scientific
ESCALAB 250) with an Al Kα target and 1486.6 eV energy at 15
kW power was used for recording the XPS data.

Photocatalytic Test
The photocatalytic performance
was evaluated by the degradation of RhB in aqueous solution under
visible-light irradiation using a 500 W Xe lamp. Hundred milliliters
of RhB (5 mg/L) solution was added to a flask containing 30 mg of
the photocatalyst. The reaction temperature was kept at room temperature
in an ice bath to inhibit the thermal catalytic effect. After a desired
period of exposure to visible light, a small quantity of the solution
was taken out, and the concentration of RhB was determined by measuring
the absorbance at 553 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The sample solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm·min–1 for 10 min to separate the BFO and RGO–BFO powder from the
solution prior to the UV–vis spectrophotometer measurement.
All the solutions were mixed homogeneously through magnetic stirring
in dark for 120 min prior to photocatalytic measurements to achieve
the adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst
and RhB. The above experiments were repeated for dark response. COD
was measured by using a Uniphos COD analyzer. The sample was prepared
by taking potassium dichromate with H2SO4 as
an oxidizer, and the test solution (2 mL) was added to it. The final
solution was digested for 2 h at 150 °C and kept for a while
to attain the room temperature, and the COD value was measured.

Electrochemical Characterization
For the electrochemical
measurement of BFO and RGO–BFO activity, the photocatalyst
slurry was prepared by dispersing 5 mg of catalysts in Nafion (5 wt
%)/ethanol solution. The slurry was subjected to vigorous ultrasonication
for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous mixture. The dispersed slurry was
cast onto the indium tin oxide substrate. An Ohmic electrical contact
was made using a silver paste and a copper wire. The exposed area
was fixed to 1 cm2 by covering it with a nontransparent
and nonconducting epoxy resin. A platinum plate was used as the counter
electrode, Ag/AgCl (sat KCl) was used as the reference electrode,
and 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical measurements,
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics, MS, EIS, and CA were carried out in a three-electrode
PEC cell. The measurement was controlled using the CIMPS-2 (controlled
intensity modulated photospectroscopy) system of Zennium Electrochemical
Workstation (X-Pot Potentiostat). The LSV measurement was carried
out under dark and visible-light illumination, where illumination
was made using a 150 W xenon lamp fitted with a filter that cuts light
of wavelengths ≤380 nm (380–800 nm) and having an output
intensity of 100 mW·cm–2. The MS measurements
were carried out under dark condition. The EIS measurement was carried
out in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 100 kHz with an ac signal
amplitude of 10 mV under open bias condition. The PEC stability of
the samples was performed by the CA measurement in 1 M KOH under visible-light
irradiation.

Computational Methodology
Ab initio
calculations based
on DFT were performed to obtain the electronic density of states (DOSs)
of BFO, RGO, and BFO–RGO combined structure. Calculations were
performed using DMol3 module of BIOVIA Material Studio. For the geometry
optimization of BFO, RGO, and BFO–RGO structures, the generalized
gradient approximation was used as an exchange correlation functional,
which is parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. All calculations
have been performed using unrestricted spin polarization. The atomic
orbitals were modeled using double numerical pulse d-functions (DND)
basis set of version 4.4 with an orbital cutoff of 5.8 Å. Monkhorst–Pack k-points with a grid of 3 × 3 × 3 were used to
perform the integration in the first Brillouin zone to calculate the
DOSs of BFO, RGO, and BFO–RGO. The geometry optimizations were
well-converged with the convergence criteria for total energy, maximum
force, maximum displacement, and self-consistent field density of
2.7 × 10–5 eV, 0.054 eV/Å, 0.005 Å,
and 10–6, respectively. In this study, BFO with
a rhombohedral perovskite-type structure having a space group of R3c and reduced graphene superlattice were
used to calculate the band gap and electronic DOSs. The tolerance
to band energy was used up to 10–5 eV.
