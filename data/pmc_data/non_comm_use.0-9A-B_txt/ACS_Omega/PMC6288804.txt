Hempseed has achieved a growing popularity
in human nutrition,
particularly regarding essential amino acids and fatty acids. The
multiple positive attributes of hempseed have led to the further study
of its constituents. In this study, hempseed extract containing phenylpropionamides
(TPA) was obtained and its chemical profile and content were obtained
using high-performance liquid chromatography technology based on previous
study. The anti-neuroinflammatory effect of TPA extract was evaluated
using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model. Fourteen phenylpropionamides
(TPA) were identified in the obtained extract with a total content
of 233.52 ± 2.50 μg/mg extract. In mice, TPA prevented
the learning and spatial memory damage induced by LPS. Increased brain
levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the LPS-induced mice
were reduced by TPA treatment. Furthermore, TPA attenuated LPS-induced
hippocampal neuronal damage in mice. This study demonstrates the nutraceutical
potential of hempseed from a neuroprotective perspective.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae
family) has been an important source of food, fiber, and traditional
medicine since historical times.1 There
are two varieties that could be distinguished by the content of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), C. sativa subsp. indica (marijuana or hashish) and C. sativa subsp. sativa (industrial
hemp). The hemp has a low content of THC, less than 0.2% on a dry
basis as legal limit for the cultivation.2,3

Hempseed has been used in different way in human nutrition, including
hempseed oil,1,4 milled hempseed as a source of
vegetable protein, dietary fiber,5 and
incorporation into food preparations (snack bars, bread, cookies,
yogurt, etc).6 It is an excellent source
of nutrients, especially due to its unsaturated fatty acids and essential
amino acids, which are rich and in correct ratio for human dietary
demands.4,7 Moreover, hempseed exert many positive effects,
including alleviating constipation,8 providing
cardiovascular health benefits,9 immunomodulation,
and ameliorating dermatological diseases4 and gastrointestinal diseases.9 Hempseed
extract showed antimutagenic effects,10 antioxidant and anti-ageing effects,11,12 and could
improve chemical drugs induced learning and memory impairment in mice.13,14 It worthy noting that the ethyl acetate extract showed prominent
effect among extracts prepared by different solvents (petroleum ether,
ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and aqueous extracts).13 Thus, hempseed should be further investigated
not only regarding amino acids or fatty acids but also other bioactive
constituents.10,15

Besides amino acids and
fatty acids, hempseed is rich in lignanamides10,16 such as cannabisin A, B, C, etc., caffeoyltyramine-like compounds,
and other polyphenols.10,17 Because the common part of these
constituents is the phenylpropionamide moiety, to simplify, we refer
to such constituents as phenylpropionamides in the text. In our previous
study on hempseed, more than 30 phenylpropionamides were isolated.16,17 We further established a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2
microglia cells model to explore the anti-neuroinflammatory activity
of these compounds. The results showed that most lignanamides had
good anti-neuroinflammatory activity by inhibiting the NF-κB
signaling pathway.15 Neuroinflammation
is a critical pathological hallmark in the development of Alzheimer’s
disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and high expression
of inflammatory mediators in the brain is associated with Aβ
deposition and neurofibrillary tangles.18 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a critical component in the outer membrane
of Gram-negative bacteria, has been used as a stimulator of microglial
cells and in animal models to trigger systemic and central inflammatory
responses.19 Recent studies have shown
that the expression of Aβ, progressive neurodegeneration, loss
of learning and memory, and the release of neuroinflammatory mediators
have been detected in LPS-induced animals.20,21

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-neuroinflammatory
effect of hempseed extract containing mainly phenylpropionamides.
The phenylpropionamide fraction was enriched from hempseed and the
chemical profile of the extract was obtained using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) technology based on our previous phytochemical
study of hempseed. The total phenylpropanamides (TPA) content and
representative constituents were measured. The anti-neuroinflammatory
effects of the TPA extract were evaluated using an LPS-induced mouse
model. This study demonstrates the nutraceutical potential of hempseed
from a new perspective.

2 Results
2.1 Phytochemical
Analysis of the TPA Extract
of Hempseed
To obtain the TPA extract of hempseed, the dried
hempseed was defatted with petroleum ether and extracted with 70%
EtOH. The crude extract was subjected to an D101 macroporous adsorption
resin column using H2O, 75%, and 95% EtOH successively
as eluents. Finally, the 75% EtOH fraction was collected and concentrated.
HPLC technology was used to study the chemical composition of the
TPA extract. Figure 1 shows the HPLC chromatogram of the TPA extract. By combining the
data from HPLC, including the retention times, the UV data on the
peaks, and co-elution with previously isolated authentic samples (Figures S1–S3, Table S1 in the Supporting
Information), 14 phenylpropionamides were identified (Table 1, see their structures in Figure S4).

to as isocannabisin N.

As
shown in Figure 1,
most compounds in the hempseed extract were identified. Therefore,
the content of TPA in the extract was quantified by summing up the
contents of the identified 14 compounds. Because the UV spectra of
compounds 3, 4, 7, and 8 were similar to that of cannabisin A (CA) and those of the
others were similar to that of N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (NC), we quantified the two kinds of compounds
using CA and NC as reference compounds, respectively. The standard
curves of CA and NC are given in Figure S5. The content of the 14 compounds was calculated based on their measured
peak area. As shown in Table 2, after summing up, the content of TPA was 233.52 ± 2.50
μg/mg extract.

2.2 TPA Extract Attenuates the Cognitive Deficit
Induced by LPS
Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to test
the spatial learning and memory ability of mice. As shown in Figure 2A, during the five
training days, the escape latency of all the groups declined progressively.
This suggests that with continuous learning, the learning ability
of each group increased. However, compared with the other groups,
the LPS model mice spent a longer period finding the platform. Especially,
on the third to fifth days, the escape latency of the model mice was
significantly longer than that of the control mice (p < 0.05, p < 0.05, and p <
0.001, respectively). These results show that the LPS-treated mice
had significant cognitive impairment. Moreover, piracetam (0.4 g/kg)-treated
and TPA (1 and 2 g/kg)-treated mice showed a significant shortened
escape latency compared with the model mice on the fifth day (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively). In the probe trial, the platform
was removed. As shown in Figure 2B–D, the model mice spent less time (p < 0.001) in the target quadrant and crossed to the
platform fewer times (p < 0.01) compared with
the control group. Compared with the model group, piracetam-treated
and TPA (1 and 2 g/kg)-treated mice showed significant increase in
both the time spent in the quadrant of the platform and the number
of crossing counts (both p < 0.01). These results
demonstrate that TPA treatment significantly improved the memory loss
induced by LPS treatment in mice.

2.3 TPA Extract
Reduces Brain Levels of Inflammatory
Cytokines in LPS-Induced Mice
Figure 3 shows the effects of TPA extract on the
brain levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α)
induced by LPS in mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
analysis indicated that exposure to LPS significantly increased the
expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the brain compared
with the control group (all p < 0.001). However,
pretreatment with TPA (1 g/kg) and piracetam significantly inhibited
the LPS-induced increase in IL-1β (both p <
0.001, Figure 3A),
IL-6 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001,
respectively, Figure 3B), and TNF-α (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively, Figure 3C) levels in the brain in comparison to model mice,
whereas TPA (2 g/kg) had no significant effect compared with the model
group. The results show that a low dose of TPA (1 g/kg) and piracetam
inhibited the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines in the brain
in an LPS-induced neuroinflammation model, but a high dose of TPA
may induce toxicity and counteract its role in inhibiting inflammatory
cytokines production.

the mean ± SD, ###p < 0.001 vs
control; ***p < 0.001, *p <
0.05 vs LPS model.)

2.4 Protective
Capacity of TPA Extract on Hippocampal
Neurons
The hippocampus plays an essential role in spatial
learning and memory function. As shown in Figure 4, hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining
indicated that the intraperitoneal injection of LPS (250 μg/kg/day)
for 7 days caused neuronal damage. In the LPS model group, this was
observed as dark-stained and deformed neurons, clearly identified
in the hippocampal CA3 region. However, there were no evident neuronal
morphological alterations in the TPA groups and the piracetam group,
indicating that TPA and piracetam can alleviate LPS-induced neuronal
damage.

region indicated by HE staining.

3 Discussion
The chemical constituents
of hempseed are complex and diverse,
including fatty acids and their esters,4 phenylpropionamides,16,17 cannabinoids,22 steroids and terpenoids,4 flavonoids
and their glycosides,23 alkaloids,24 and proteins. Except fatty acids and protein,
phenylpropionamides are the most studied and well-reported. Compounds
of this class mainly include N-trans-caffeoyltyramine, N-trans-feryroyltyramine,
and their various structural dimers called lignanamides.16,17,25−27 According to
reports in the literature, more than 20 kinds of phenylpropionamides
have been isolated from hempseed.11,26 Our previous
study on hempseed further increased the varieties of phenylpropionamides.16,17 Some of them showed good antioxidant and anti-neuroinflammatory
activities.16,17 Their bioactivities and benefits
must be considered when evaluating hempseed as a functional food.
Presently, studies in this field are not enough. Cai et al.28 determined the anti-aging effect of hempseed
oil, protein, and ligananamide on old mice and found that all of them
showed obvious effect. Lin et al.13 investigated
the effect of hempseed extracts prepared by different solvents (petroleum
ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous) on mice
with experimental Alzheimer’s disease and found that hempseed
extracts conspicuously alleviated learning and memory ability, as
well as improved brain tissue pathological changes in experimental
dementia mice, whereas the ethyl acetate extract demonstrates a more
prominent improvement than other extracts. According to our experience,16 the ethyl acetate extract contains mainly ligananamide
and other phenylpropionamides. This study obtained a hempseed extract
containing mainly phenylpropionamides and described its chemical profile
based on our phytochemical study on hempseed.16,17 Fourteen phenylpropionamides were identified from the extract and
the total content was obtained. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect
of the TPA extract was evaluated using an LPS-induced neuroinflammatory
model in mice.

The results showed that TPA treatment significantly
improved the
learning and memory of LPS-induced neuroinflammatory mice, and significantly
improved their cognitive function. Low-dose TPA significantly reduced
the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the brains
of LPS-induced mice. From the observation of the morphology of hippocampal
neurons in mice, it was found that TPA prevented damage to nerve cells
in the hippocampal CA3 region induced by LPS, indicating that TPA
has neuroprotective effects. However, as we can see in the experiment,
the dose-dependent relation of TPA regarding the expression of IL-1β,
IL-6, and TNF-α in the brains of LPS-induced mice was not as
expected, suggesting that the safe and effective dose for TPA is less
than 2 g/kg; this should be researched in more detail. According to
the reports in literature,20,21 most studies use Swiss
or ICR mice for modeling. Here, we have demonstrated that Kunming
mice are also applicable to the LPS model. However, further studies
are necessary to evaluate the anti-neuroinflammatory function of hempseed,
including the use different mouse models and measuring more biomarkers.

Presently, fourteen phenylpropionamides have been identified from
the extract, including caffeoyloctopamine, caffeoyltyramine, coumaroyltyramine,
feryroyltyramine, cannabisins (A–F, M, N), grossamide, and
demethyl-grossamide. In our previous cell-level screening test, most
of them showed anti-neuroinflammatory activity in LPS-induced BV2
microglia cell, especially caffeoyltyramine, cannabisin F, G, M, and
grossamide.17 Actually, some other phenylpropionamides
of low content also showed good anti-neuroinflammatory activity,17 but they could not be identified and measured
online from the extract because of their low content and lack of standard
substances. We selected grossamide as a representative compound to
study its anti-neuroinflammatory mechanism and found it able to significantly
inhibit the LPS-mediated secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators,
reduce the phosphorylation levels of NF-κB subunit p65 in a
concentration-dependent manner, and suppress the translocation of
NF-κB p65 into the nucleus, suggesting that grossamide could
intervene the NF-κB signaling pathway.15 Further study still need to be done to elucidate the anti-neuroinflammatory
contribution of hempseed constituents.

Overall, our previous
study found that the phenylpropanamide compounds
in hempseed have significant anti-neuroinflammatory activities at
the cellular level. In this study, we established a mouse model of
neuroinflammation induced by LPS and found that hempseed extract rich
in phenylpropionamides possesses effective anti-neuroinflammatory
activity. This neuroprotective function of hempseed makes it worth
noting as a functional food.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Plant Material and Extract Preparation
Hemp (C. sativa L.) seed material
was collected in Bama county, Guangxi province of China, in October
2016 and identified by Professor Lan Xiang, Department of Pharmacognosy,
Shandong University. Voucher specimens (201610-1) have been deposited
in Dr Fan’s laboratory at Shandong University, China.

The dried and crushed hempseed (3 kg) was first defatted with petroleum
ether (25 L) under ultrasound for 1 h three times and then extracted
with 70% aqueous ethanol (EtOH) under reflux (three times, 25 L ×
2 h). The ethanol solution was subsequently concentrated to 500 mL
by evaporating in a vacuum. This solution was suspended in distilled
water and subjected to a D101 macroporous adsorption resin column
using H2O, 75%, and 95% EtOH successively to obtain the
75% EtOH fraction (41.2 g, 1.37%, extract of hempseed).

4.2 Phytochemical Identification and Quantitation
of TPA in Hempseed Extract
4.2.1 HPLC–DAD Qualitative
Analysis
The 75% EtOH fraction was dissolved in methanol
as the sample solution
and analyzed by HPLC with a diode array detector (DAD) detector. Identification
of the sample solution was performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC
system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a G-1315D DAD detector.
The samples were separated through an Eclipse XDB-C18 column (4.6
× 250 mm2, 5 μm; Agilent) using water (A)–acetonitrile
(B) as the mobile phase, and detected under 280 nm at 25 °C.
The gradient elution for the mobile phase was set as follows: 10%
B at the beginning, 20% at 5 min, 30% at 25 min, 45% at 45 min, and
75% at 55 min. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min and the injection volume
was 20 μL.

The compounds were identified based on a comparison
with the retention times and UV spectral characteristics and co-elution
with authentic samples previously isolated and identified by NMR analysis
in our laboratory.16

4.2.2 HPLC–DAD Quantitative Analysis
To a weighed
quantity containing 16.1 mg of hempseed extract, 10
mL of methanol was added as the sample solution; this was repeated
three times. The sample solution was analyzed according to the above-mentioned
HPLC–DAD chromatographic conditions and the peak area was recorded.
A standard curve was prepared using cannabisin A (CA) and N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (NC) as standard
compounds, and the total content of the identified compounds was calculated.

4.3 Animals
Male Kunming mice (31.1 ±
2.2 g, 8 weeks old) were obtained from Shandong University Animal
Services (Shandong, China). The mice were housed under standard laboratory
conditions of temperature (24 ± 1 °C), humidity (50 ±
5%), and light (12 h light/dark cycle). The animals were allowed free
access to food and water. All the procedures were approved by the
Shandong University Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out
in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for
the care and use of laboratory animals (Publication No. 85-23, revised
1985).

4.4 Drugs and Reagents
Lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) from Escherichia coli (055:B5),
piracetam, and radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer
were purchased from Solarbio (Beijing, China). LPS was dissolved in
0.9% saline solution, and all the other drugs were dissolved in distilled
water. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits were purchased from Boster (Wuhan, China).

4.5 Experimental Groups and Treatment
Sixty male Kunming
mice were randomly divided into five groups (n =
12/group), including control (1–3 weeks, 0.9%
saline, 10 mL/kg/day), model (third week, 0.9% saline, 10 mL/kg/day),
TPA (1–3 week, 1, 2 g/kg/day), and piracetam (2–3 week,
0.4 g/kg/day) treatment groups. Piracetam was used as a positive control
due to its therapeutic effect on cognition in aging and dementia,
as well as its ability to improve mitochondrial function to ameliorate
the detrimental effects of Aβ on brain function.29,30

After 2 weeks of administration, the model, TPA, and piracetam
groups were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (250 μg/kg/day)
on day 15, 30 min after treatment with TPA (1, 2 g/kg/day) and piracetam
(0.4 g/kg/day). Intraperitoneal injection of LPS continued for an
additional week. One hour after the LPS administration on day 16,
memory function was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) test
for 6 consecutive days (for the time line of drug treatment and experimental
schedule, see Figure S6).

4.6 Morris Water Maze Test
The Morris
water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the spatial learning and
memory of the mice.31 The equipment consists
of a black circular pool (120 cm in diameter, 50 cm in height), platform,
and recording system. The pool was divided into four quadrants, and
an invisible transparent platform (9 cm in diameter) was placed at
the center of the second quadrant and submerged 1 cm below the water
surface. A black edible pigment was added to the water, so the water
was opaque. The water temperature was maintained at 22–24 °C.
This behavioral task included hidden-platform training (spatial learning)
and probe trial (spatial memory) sessions.

In the hidden-platform
training session, the mice were allowed four daily trials in the presence
of the platform for five subsequent days. In this session, the mice
were placed in the pool facing the wall in one of the four quadrants.
When the mouse located the platform, the time required to find the
hidden escape platform (escape latency) was recorded and the mouse
was allowed to stay on the platform for 15 s. If the mouse did not
locate the platform within 90 s, it was placed on the platform for
15 s to familiarize it and the escape latency was considered to be
90 s. On day 6, the probe trial was performed. In this session, the
platform was removed. The time spent in the target quadrant and the
number of times that the mouse crossed the removed platform was recorded
and analyzed during 90 s.

4.7 Tissue Processing
After the MWM test,
the animals (n = 6/group) were decapitated and the
brain was rapidly moved on ice. Thereafter, each mouse brain was weighed,
homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (with 1:100 PMSF, a protease inhibitor)
to a concentration of 100 mg/mL, and centrifuged at 10 000
rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were collected and stored
at −80 °C for ELISA.

In addition, another cohort
(n = 6/group) of mice was anesthetized with 5% chloral
hydrate and transcardially perfused with a 0.9% saline solution, followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). The brains were removed from the
skull and then fixed in the same 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4
°C.

4.8 Detection of the Levels of TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-6 by ELISA
The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-6 in the mice brains were assessed using ELISA kits (Boster,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance
was read at 450 nm on a microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek). All
the results are expressed as pg/mg.

4.9 Hippocampal
Morphology Examination
To observe the histological changes
in the hippocampus in the LPS-induced
mice, the brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution
at 4 °C for 24 h. The brain specimens were paraffin-embedded
and coronal sections were cut (4 μm thick) before mounting on
silane-coated slides. The coronal sections were processed for HE staining
according to a previously described method.32 The images were taken using an optical microscope (Olympus BX53F,
Tokyo, Japan) at magnifications of 200× and 400×, respectively.

4.10 Statistical Analysis
All the data
are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical
analysis was done by one-way analysis of variance followed by the
Student–Newman–Keuls test using GraphPad Prism version
5.0 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA). P values less
than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
