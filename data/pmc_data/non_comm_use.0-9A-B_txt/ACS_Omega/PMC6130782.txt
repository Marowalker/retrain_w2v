The
chemical composition of commercial Syzygium
aromaticum, Cinnamomum verum, and Laurus nobilis essential oils
as well as their antifungal activity against four pathogenic fungi
isolated from Mediterranean rice grains has been investigated. Eighty
nine compounds accounting for between 98.5 and 99.4% of the total
essential oil were identified. The phenylpropanoids eugenol (89.37
± 0.29%) and eugenol (56.34 ± 0.41%), followed by eugenol
acetate (19.48 ± 0.13%) were, respectively, the main compounds
in clove and cinnamon essential oils, whereas large amounts of the
oxygenated monoterpenes 1,8-cineole (58.07 ± 0.83%) and α-terpinyl
acetate (13.05 ± 0.44%) were found in bay leaf essential oil.
Clove and cinnamon oils showed the best antifungal activity results
against all tested fungi. Against Alternaria alternata, clove essential oil displayed the best antifungal effect, whereas
against Curvularia hawaiiensis, cinnamon
essential oil was more active. Both essential oils showed a similar
antifungal effect towards Fusarium proliferatum and Fusarium oxysporum. In vitro
studies in inoculated rice grains showed that clove and cinnamon totally
inhibited pathogenic fungal development after 30 days of incubation.
In vivo studies showed that eugenol used with a polysaccharide such
as agar–agar formed a fine coat which wraps the inoculated
rice grains, creating a natural biofilm and reducing the development
of all pathogenic fungi (80–95%) for 30 days.

==== Body
Introduction
Cereal fungal contamination causes both
economic and human health
problems. Economically important diseases, such as smuts, leaf spots,
crown rots, and root rots are usually caused by Bipolaris, Curvularia, Fusarium, and Alternaria species.1 Infection
of cereal seeds is a serious problem because these pathogens can remain
viable for 10 years and are subsequently capable of propagating across
other geographical areas, infecting further crops and achieving global
dissemination.2,3Bipolaris and Curvularia are closely related genera of plant pathogens
as well as emerging opportunistic human pathogens.4−6 Several species,
according to the method of infection and immune status, have been
reported, from mild skin and nail infections to severe invasive human
diseases. Curvularia is an important dematiaceous
fungus involved in phaeohyphomycosis; Curvularia australiensis, Ctenochaetus hawaiiensis, and Curvularia spicifera have frequently been isolated
from human phaeohyphomycoses.7−9 These three species were formerly
classified as members of the genus Bipolaris; however,
phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that species previously placed
in Bipolaris, especially those known as human pathogens,
actually belong to the Curvularia genus.4

The genus Fusarium includes
plant pathogens of
agricultural crops, as well as mycotoxin-producing species.10 Several species of Fusarium, such as Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium proliferatum, and Fusarium oxysporum are responsible for the higher
fumonisin levels observed in cereals. It is well known that these
mycotoxins constitute a principal health risk for domesticated animals,
being also associated with a number of human health problems, probably
due to the consumption of large amounts of cereal-based products.11 These emerging problems need increasing attention
because of their toxic effects. Particularly worrying is the recently
found high contamination levels of breakfast and infant cereals, such
as muesli and cornflakes, which usually contain favorable ingredients
for fungi colonization, with Fusarium mycotoxins
such as ochratoxin A that has a studied impact on human health.12

Fusarium, together with Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Trichoderma genera, belongs to the allergenic fungi, important producers of
outdoor airborne allergens which have been found in plant and soil
samples from agricultural fields in which cereals are grown.13

On the other hand, Alternaria is the most common
genus of endophytes in plants. Pathogenic Alternaria such as Alternaria alternata are
used to control the host weed. A suspension of Alternaria J46 mycelial segments and culture filtrates of the fungi display
marked seed germination inhibition against different species, including
the most important cereal crops worldwide for human consumption, wheat
and rice.14 This represents important economic
losses as well as health problems due to Alternaria, which is also an important allergenic fungi and opportunistic human
pathogen in immunocompromised patients.

Previous studies carried
out by our research team showed significant
antifungal effects of commercial oregano and thyme essential oils
against phytopathogenic fungi.15,16 The aims of this work
were to (1) analyze the chemical composition of commercial essential
oils of bay leaf, cinnamon, and clove, (2) determine the most important
isolates and to identify four pathogens from rice seeds by morphological
and molecular techniques, (3) evaluate in vitro and in vivo antifungal
activity of essential oils, and (4) evaluate a natural biofilm we
have created as an antifungal product for rice conservation.

Eighty nine compounds accounting for between 98.5
and 99.4% of
the total essential oil were identified. In clove and cinnamon essential
oils, more than 89% of aromatic compounds biosynthesized by the shikimic
acid pathway were found: the phenylpropanoid eugenol (89.37 ±
0.29%) and eugenol (56.34 ± 0.41%), followed by eugenol acetate
(19.48 ± 0.13%) were, respectively, the main compounds, whereas
large amounts of the oxygenated monoterpenes 1,8-cineole (58.07 ±
0.83%) and α-terpinyl acetate (13.05 ± 0.44%) were found
in bay leaf essential oil.

Antifungal Activity in Solid Media
Clove essential
oil was more effective against A. alternata, whereas cinnamon essential oil was more active against C. hawaiiensis (Table 2, Figures 1–3). Both essential oils displayed
a similar antifungal effect against F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum. Cinnamon and clove
completely inhibited the growth of C. hawaiiensis to days 7 and 8 (Figures 1 and 2). In model conditions assayed
at 300 μg/mL, bay leaf essential oil showed no significant antifungal
activity against the tested phytopathogenic fungi, whereas clove and
cinnamon showed significant antifungal activity against all tested
fungi, with a similar behavior pattern (Figure 3).

For the measured mycelial growth
inhibition (MGI), the antifungal
effect of cinnamon at doses of 100 and 200 μg/mL against C. hawaiiensis is noteworthy (Table 3). At the highest concentration (300 μg/mL),
pure eugenol showed the best antifungal activity results against all
tested phytopathogenic fungi (Table 3).

Essential Oils
on Rice Storage
In vitro studies showed
that the disease produced in rice grains inoculated with all tested
fungi (A. alternata, C. hawaiiensis, F. proliferatum, and F. oxysporum) was totally inhibited
when the kernels were placed into PDA-clove and PDA-cinnamon (Figure 4). Both essential
oils completely inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi in the caryopsis
rice at 300 μg/mL after 30 days of incubation.

In vivo
studies showed that eugenol used with a polysaccharide such as agar–agar
(0.25%) formed a fine coat which wraps the inoculated rice grains,
creating a natural biofilm and reducing the development of all pathogenic
fungi at 300 and 600 μg/mL (Figure 4). Eugenol significantly
(P < 0.05) reduced fungal growth in stored rice,
depending on the dose used after 30 days of incubation at 28 °C.
At 300 μg/mL, eugenol showed high antifungal activity, reducing C. hawaiiensis, F. proliferatum, and F. oxysporum by between 85 and
82%. At 600 μg/mL, A. alternata was reduced by 80% and the highest antifungal activity was 95 and
92% in C. hawaiiensis, F. proliferatum, and F. oxysporum, showing an antifungal effect after 30 days of incubation at 28
°C (Figure 5).

Discussion
Eugenol,
the main compound in both essential oils, is a natural
phenolic compound characterized, among a wide range of biological
properties, by its antifungal activity;16 in the year 2013 it was approved as a fungicide by the European
Food Safety Authority (EFSA), (Reg. EU No. 546/2013). Also, the use
of eugenol coated with polysaccharides such as agar–agar enhances
the shelf life of rice during the storage period.18

The chemical versatility of its structure has led
to the use of
this compound as a starting biological material for the synthesis
of new antifungal eugenol derivative agents to reduce nosocomial infections
caused by Candida spp., especially in patients admitted
to an intensive care unit.19 The antifungal
activity of eugenol against clinically relevant fungi, including fluconazole-resistant
strains, has also been observed for clove essential oil, which is
able to inhibit Aspergillus and Candida species (such as C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis) and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans isolates, as well as clinical dermatophyte strains.20

According to samples of Syzygium aromaticum leaf essential oil grown in Madagascar21 and in the commercial clove oil analyzed here, the main compound
is the phenylpropanoid eugenol (89.37 ± 0.29%), followed by the
sesquiterpene hydrocarbons β-caryophyllene (6.02 ± 0.41%)
and α-humulene (1.70 ± 0.09%). Only two compounds, caryophyllene
oxide (0.77 ± 0.04%) and humulene epoxide (0.15 ± 0.01%),
were detected in the oxygenated sesquiterpene fraction. In addition,
neither hydrocarbons nor oxygenated monoterpenes were present in the
commercial S. aromaticum essential
oil analyzed here. However, the main compounds found in Cinnamomum verum were the phenylpropanoid eugenol
(56.34 ± 0.41%), eugenol acetate (19.48 ± 0.13%), E-cinnamyl acetate (6.52 ± 0.03%), and E-cinnamaldehyde (2.08 ± 0.00%), along with a large amount of
the aromatic compound benzyl benzoate (4.81 ± 0.03%). On the
other hand, in this essential oil, 30 compounds biosynthesized from
the mevalonic acid pathway were identified but only the monoterpene
hydrocarbon β-phellandrene (1.00 ± 0.03%), the sesquiterpene
hydrocarbon β-caryophyllene (1.81 ± 0.01%), and the oxygenated
sesquiterpene caryophyllene oxide (1.05 ± 0.03%) reached percentages
close to or higher than 1%. Finally, oxygenated monoterpenes were
quantitatively the minor fraction (1.14 ± 0.04%) in cinnamon
essential oil, with linalool (0.57 ± 0.01%), α-terpineol
(0.17 ± 0.01%), terpinen-4-ol (0.1 3± 0.00%), and borneol
(0.12 ± 0.00%) as the main compounds. Although both essential
oils have the same main compound, eugenol (89.37 ± 0.29 vs 56.34
± 0.41%), commercial clove essential oil contains a higher quantity
of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (8.06 ± 0.50 vs 2.56 ± 0.02%),
whereas commercial cinnamon essential oil has more oxygenated sesquiterpenes
(1.40 ± 0.03 vs 0.90 ± 0.03%) and both hydrocarbons (3.84
± 0.13%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (1.14 ± 0.04%) that
were not detected in clove essential oil. S. aromaticum and Cinnamomum zeylanicum were the
most active tested essential oils against stem and ear rot caused
by Stenocarpella maydis responsible
for severe losses in maize, reducing the pathogen incidence in the
seeds by 39.0 and 28.0%, respectively.22 Although C. zeylanicum has a lower
content of eugenol than S. aromaticum, the presence of eugenol acetate (19.48 ± 0.13%), trans-cinnamyl acetate (6.52 ± 0.03%), benzyl benzoate (4.81 ±
0.03%), and trans-cinnamaldehyde (2.08 ± 0.00%)
in the commercial cinnamon essential oil here analyzed may contribute
to the antifungal activity.23,24 In fact, cinnamaldehyde
was found to have more antifungal activity than eugenol against Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton
rubrum(25) and a study about
the antifungal effects against Fusarium spp. and C. zeylanicum with trans-cinnamaldehyde
as the main compound showed more anti-Fusarium activity
than with Citrus limon, Juniperus communis, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gaultheria procumbens, Melaleuca alternifolia, Origanum majorana, Salvia sclarea, and Thymus vulgaris essential oils.26

On the other hand, eugenol (57.0%) has been described
as the main
compound in commercial bay leaf essential oil27 as well as in samples of Laurus nobilis essential oil (eugenol 44.13%), followed by a large amount of cinnamaldehyde
(30.28%)28 that has antifungal effects
against fungi (Eurotium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium) commonly responsible for spoilage
of bakery products or postharvest diseases produced by A. alternata in cherry tomatoes, respectively. However,
the commercial bay leaf essential oil analyzed here is characterized
by a high monoterpene fraction content (94.39%), mainly oxygenated
monoterpenes (81.76 ± 0.24%), with 1,8-cineol (58.07 ± 0.83%)
and α-terpinyl acetate (13.05 ± 0.44%) as the main compounds.
A similar composition was found in commercial L. nobilis essential oil from Spain with medicinal items 1,8-cineole (51%)
and α-terpinyl acetate (10%),29 with L. nobilis essential oil from Brazil 1,8-cineole
(35.50%), linalool (14.10%), sabinene (9.45%), and terpinyl acetate
(9.65%)30 or with dried bay leaves purchased
from a local market in Tunisia, with 1,8-cineole (39.76%) and α-terpinyl
acetate (13.35%)31 as the main compounds.
Bay leaf essential oils with a high content of 1,8-cineole, linalool
and terpinyl acetate were shown to have antibacterial activity toward
foodborne pathogens, such as Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica in fresh
Tuscan sausage,30 and also antifungal activity
against Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia laxa, and Penicillium digitatum.32 However, the tested bay leaf essential
oil with a high content of the oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineol did
not show a significant antifungal effect against the four pathogenic
fungi isolated from rice grains. These results are in accordance with
the potency level of antifungal activity measured as in vitro mycelial
growth of the main compounds (thymol > eugenol > carvone >
terpinen-4-ol
> 1,8-cineole) of essential oils.33

Conclusions
Clove and cinnamon essential oils with the highest amounts (89.37
and 56.34%, respectively) of eugenol, contrary to bay leaf essential
oil containing 58.07% of the oxygenated monoterpene 1,8-cineole, have
a significant antifungal effect against the four pathogenic fungi
isolated from rice grains. In vivo studies showed that eugenol used
with a polysaccharide such as agar–agar forms a fine coat that
wraps the inoculated rice grains, creating a natural biofilm and reducing
the development of all pathogenic fungi (80–95%) for 30 days.
Eugenol could be used as an effective nontoxic preservative in stored
rice grains against A. alternata, C. hawaiiensis, F. proliferatum, and F. oxysporum contamination,
increasing their shelf life.

Materials and Methods
Plant Material
Commercial samples of clove leaf (Syzygium aromaticum L.) were supplied by Guinama
and cinnamon leaf (C. verum J. Presl)
and bay leaf (Laurus nobilis L.) essential
oils were supplied by Essential Arôms. The essential oils were
stored at 4 °C until chemical analysis and antifungal studies
were done.

Gas Chromatography (GC)–Mass Spectrometry
(MS)
A gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis was
carried out with Agilent 5973N apparatus, equipped with a capillary
column (95 dimethylpolysiloxane-5% diphenyl) and an HP-5MS UI (30
m long and 0.25 mm i.d. with 0.25 μm film thickness). The column
temperature program was 60 °C for 5 min, with 3 °C/min increases
to 180 °C and then 20 °C/min increases to 280 °C. This
program was maintained for 10 min. Helium was the carrier gas used
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Split mode injection (ratio 1:30) was
employed. Mass spectra were taken over the m/z 30–500 range, with an ionizing voltage of 70 eV.
Kovat’s retention index (RI) was calculated using cochromatographed
standard hydrocarbons. The individual compounds were identified by
MS, and their identity was confirmed by comparison of their RIs, relative
to C8–C32n-alkanes,
and mass spectra with authentic samples or with data already available
in the NIST 2005 Mass Spectral Library and in the literature.17

Fungal Species
Four phytopathogenic
fungi, A. alternata (Fr.) Keissler
CECT 20943 (LBEA 2103), Curvularia hawaiiensis Manamgoda, Cai & Hyde
CECT 20934 (LBEA 2105) F. proliferatum (Matsush.) Nirenberg CECT 20944 (LBEA 2170), and F. oxysporum (Sacc.) Snyder & Hansen CECT 2715
(LBEA 2004) were isolated in the Laboratorio Botánica of the
Departament of Ecosistemas Agroforestales (LBEA) Universitat Politècnica
de València from Bomba rice samples collected in a Mediterranean
region producing rice (Valencia, Spain). The fungal species were morphologically
and molecularly identified and then deposited in the Spanish Type
Culture Collection (CECT).

Fungal Strain Identification
Morphological
analysis
consisted of inoculation, incubation, and validation of culture characteristics,
as well as microscopic observation, growing data, or colony morphology.
Molecular analysis was based on amplification, sequencing, and BLAST
alignment comparison of target regions in fungal DNA for forward and
reverse directions: internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2
of ribosomic DNA, including the 5.8S rRNA gene, using the primers
its1 and its4;34,35 D1/D2 domains on the 5′
end of the gene which codifies 28S rRNA, using nl1 and nl4 primers;36,37 a 0.3 kb fragment of the EF-1α gene (transcription elongation
factor), with EF-1728F and EF-986R primers38 and, finally, partial sequencing of the β-tubulin gene using
Bt2a and Bt2b primers.39

Sequence
comparison between the amplified regions and those available in the
NCBI Taxonomy Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) and BLAST analysis of
the sequences against assembling the fungal tree of life and MycoBank/CBS-KNAW
Fungal Biodiversity Center (BioloMICSNet Software) databases showed
that the isolate LBEA 2103 (CECT 20943) showed 99% identity for ITS
regions and 100% identity for 28S rRNA 5′ domains with C. hawaiiensis (synonymous with Curvularia
oryzae); the isolate LBEA 2105 (CECT 20923) showed
100% identity for ITS regions, 99% identity for EF-1α elongation
factor, and 100% identity for the β-tubulin gene with the complex Alternaria sp. aff. A. alternata; the isolate LBEA 2170 (CECT 20944) showed 100% identity for ITS
regions and 99.67% identity for β-tubulin gene with the species F. proliferatum (teleomorph Gibberella
intermedia), and finally, the isolate LBEA 2004 (CECT
2715) showed 100% identity for ITS regions and 99.65% identity for
EF-1α elongation factor with F. oxysporum.

Antifungal Activity in Solid Media
Growth Rate and Mycelial
Growth Inhibition (MGI)
Essential
oils were dissolved, mixed, and homogenized in previously sterilized
and still liquid PDA/Tween 20 (0.1%) at 300 μg/mL. Then, it
was distributed in 90 × 15 and 150 × 15 mm2 Petri
dishes. Fungi were sowed in the center of each Petri dish with 8 mm
discoid explants from a 7 day culture. Petri dish plates were incubated
in the dark at 25 °C for 7 and 14 days. Control Petri dishes
only had PDA/Tween 20 (0.1%). Fungi growth was evaluated by measuring
the daily diameter of the colony in two perpendicular directions,
calculating the speed of growth. Six repetitions were made per treatment.
MGI also was calculated according to the following formula at 100,
200, and 300 μg/mL  CD: average diameter of colonies
in nontreated
dishes (without essential oil); OD: average diameter of colonies in
treated dishes (with essential oil).

Essential Oils on Rice
Storage
Valencian rice healthy
grains were washed with sodium hypochlorite (20%) for 5 min, rinsed
twice with distilled water, and air-dried at room temperature (25
± 2 °C). Then, 150 seeds of rice for each tested fungus
were dipped into a flask containing 50 mL of a spore suspension of
5 × 105 conidia/mL prepared in water–Tween
20 (0.1%) for 30 min; finally, they were air-dried to complete dryness.
Two experiments were carried out.

In Vitro Study of Essential
Oil Antifungal Effect on Rice Caryopsis
The eugenol (98%)
used in this study was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
Inoculated rice caryopsis were placed into Petri dishes containing
PDA-bay leaf, PDA-clove, and PDA-cinnamon, 300 μg/mL (5 seeds
per plate). For each fungus, six replicate dishes were used. Plates
were incubated in the dark at 25 °C and high relative humidity
(90–95%) for 30 days. Control Petri dishes contained equal
amounts of sterilized water/Tween 20 (0.1%) on PDA but without essential
oils. Fungal growth was evaluated through observation for 30 days.

In Vivo Study of Eugenol Antifungal Effect on Rice Caryopsis
Rice caryopsis inoculated with the molds were placed inside 150
× 150 mm2 plastic boxes, 100 seeds per box. Two concentrations
(300 and 600 μg/mL) of eugenol were prepared in Tween 20 (0.1%)–agar
0.25%. Then, 5 mL of each solution was sprayed into the boxes. The
seeds were wetted with the prepared solutions and dried to complete
dryness, forming a fine coating. Controls were prepared similarly
for volatile treatment with equal amounts of sterilized water/Tween
20 (0.1%)–agar 0.25% but without eugenol. All boxes were then
transferred to storage at 28 °C and high relative humidity (90–95%)
for 30 days. The percentage of infected rice grains was recorded after
30 days of incubation with an Olympus SZX10 magnifying glass.

Statistical Analysis
The fungal growth results were
submitted to an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Furthermore, HSD Tukey
intervals were represented with significant values at P < 0.05. Data analysis was performed using Statgraphics Centurion
XVI.
