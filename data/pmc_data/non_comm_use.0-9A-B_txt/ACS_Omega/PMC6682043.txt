Herein,
ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy is performed
to probe the electron transfer studies between aqueous solution and
gold nanorods (Au NRs). The seed-mediated growth method is used to
synthesize crystalline cylindrical Au NRs having longitudinal plasmon
resonance peak maximum at 825 nm. The as-synthesized Au NRs show average
width and length of ∼10 ± 2 and ∼50 ± 2 nm,
respectively, with an aspect ratio in the range of ∼5. The
time-resolved decay profiles have been studied in a subpicosecond
resolution range using pump wavelength at 410 nm excitation and probe
wavelengths from visible to near-infrared region. The plasmon dynamics
studies of Au NRs depend on the electron heating phenomena, coherent
acoustic phonon vibration and electronic transient behavior, i.e.,
electron–phonon coupling, and homogenous dephasing processes.
Thus, the obtained results highlighted that the ultrafast charge transfer
dynamics studies in Au NRs could play an important role to elucidate
their electronic, photothermal, and optical properties for molecular
imaging, photothermal therapy, and optoelectronic and light-harvesting
devices.

Introduction
Surface plasmon resonances
(SPR) of gold nanorods (Au NRs) are
induced by an incident electromagnetic excitation; collective and
coherent oscillations occur in electrons presented in their conduction
band.1 The SPRs can lead to enhancement
and confinement in large local field, which increases the light–matter
interaction between the medium at nanometer range.2−4 The length and
width of Au NRs in SPR modes correspond to the longitudinal and transverse
excitations, respectively, which occur in the higher- and lower-wavelength
regions of the absorption spectrum. The longitudinal SPR depends on
various factors such as the surfactant materials, size, shape, and
alignment of Au NRs.5−8

The optical excitation perturbs the electronic distribution
of
nanoparticles/nanorods in the SPR band or interband as well as intraband
transitions. The SPR band absorption changes due to the electronic
distribution and lattice heating/cooling mechanism.9,10 Moreover,
the internal electronic thermalization process and the scattering
between the electron–phonon and phonon–phonon play a
major role in describing the relaxation process in Au NRs.9 The electron dynamics as well as the relaxation
process have been explored by ultrafast optical excitation at the
surface plasmon resonance and away from it with the transient absorption
spectroscopy (TAS).9−11 Basically, TAS is the time-resolved pump–probe
method where the electrons in metal nanostructures are excited by
a femtosecond pump pulse. The underlying mechanism is that the laser
excited by a near-UV or visible pump pulse process gives relaxation
times under different frequency. The electron–phonon scattering
(within 1–5 ps) thermalizes the hot electrons with its lattice
so the broadening and bleaching phenomena occur between the plasmon
resonance absorption bands. Further, the phonon–phonon scattering
(within longer time scales of >100 ps) releases heat to the surrounding
medium.11−15 The decay time of electron–phonon relaxation depends on the
increased electron temperature, which is related to the power of the
pump pulse that linearly rises with pump energy.16 Thus, the nanoscale thermal transport mechanism of Au NRs
excited by pulsed laser serves as a promising multifunctional agent
for biomedical imaging, photothermal therapy, and drug delivery. The
few experimental studies have been focused on the electron dynamics
of the Au NRs by pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy.9−11,17−20

Herein, the ultrafast dynamics
studies of Au NRs synthesized by
seed-mediated method are demonstrated. Basically, TAS analysis and
femtosecond time-resolved studies using the pump–probe method
around the surface plasmon resonance of Au NRs have been performed
to interrogate the material response at an ultrafast time scale. For
TAS measurements, both probe and pump are tuned in the visible wavelength
range to excite the electrons for optimization of the absorption signals
and avoiding any kind of error and artifacts. Additionally, the femtosecond
laser provides major advantage of thermal confinement, which leads
to sufficient time resolution for studying the co-relation between
the distribution of excited electrons and phonon in Au NRs. Thus,
Au NRs act as best legitimate to study the thermal transport behavior
across the Au NRs along with the surroundings as well as in an aqueous
medium.

Results and Discussion
Prior to ultrafast studies of
Au NRs, the structural/microstructural
characterizations and spectroscopic studies are performed to detect
the morphological, structural, and optical properties of Au NRs. Figure 1a,b shows the transmission
electron micrography (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images
of Au NRs, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the uniform
and monodispersed Au NRs have width and length of ∼10 ±
2 and ∼50 ± 2 nm, respectively, with an aspect ratio in
the range of ∼5. The TEM images at different places of sample
are also shown in Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information). It confirms the synthesis
of uniformly aligned gold nanorods having the same aspect ratio. The
magnified view of the HRTEM image is displayed in the inset of Figure 1b. It exhibits the
lattice fringes with d spacing of 0.148 nm with respect
to the (220) plane of Au NRs. The crystallographic structure of Au
NRs was also determined by selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
pattern, as shown in Figure 1c, which also supports the HRTEM result. Further, UV–vis
absorption spectrum of Au NRs colloidal solution is shown in Figure 1d, which reveals
two absorption peaks: 530 and 825 nm. The peak in the shorter-wavelength
region at 530 nm corresponds to the oscillation of plasmon in transverse
mode, whereas the peak in the longer-wavelength region at 825 nm corresponds
to oscillation of plasmon in the longitudinal mode. The absorption
peak at 530 nm relates to spherical nanostructures, and the peak in
the region 700–1300 nm relates to rod nanostructures of gold
depending upon the aspect ratio of nanorods and seed concentration
during the synthesis process.21,22 The obtained longitudinal
peak wavelength value corresponds to ∼5 nm aspect ratio, which
has been calculated by generative adversarial networks theory23 and discrete dipole approximation theory,23,24 clearly matching with TEM analysis. The optical image of the as-synthesized
Au NRs colloidal solution is shown in the inset of Figure 1d, which displays wine red
color under daylight. Furthermore, Figure S2 shows that the chemical stability of the as-synthesized Au NRs was
also confirmed by performing UV–visible spectrum time-to-time
in several statistical runs (see the Supporting Information). The obtained spectra show no change in the absorption
peaks even after 7 days and 1 month, which confirms the chemical stability
of Au NRs.

pattern, and (d) UV–vis spectrum of the as-synthesized gold
nanorods (inset: optical image of gold nanorods solution).

The chemical purity and elemental analysis of the
Au NRs has been
carried out via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Figure S3a displays the XPS survey scan spectrum
of Au NRs (see the Supporting Information). The binding energy in XPS result indicates the presence of carbon,
oxygen, bromide, and gold elements. No other impurity elements were
found. The high-resolution spectra of Au show doublet peak at 83.38
and 87.13 eV, corresponding to the presence of Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states (Figure S3b; see the Supporting Information). The
high-resolution spectra peak at 284.83 eV corresponds to C 1s carbon
peak. It may be due to the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) that
is present on the surface of Au NRs (Figure S3c; see the Supporting Information). The
Ag(I) oxidation state is confirmed by the peak at 402.29 eV, which
indicates the presence of Ag 3d states. The binding energy of Br 3d
state is depicted by the peak at 68.46 eV, which is due to the presence
of bromide in CTAB rather than silver bromide solution. Br/Ag ratio
in the XPS images is in good agreement with the ratio present in CTAB.

The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum of the as-synthesized
Au NRs under 375 nm excitation wavelength is shown in Figure 2a. Basically, the origin of
PL is associated with three major reasons: (i) excitation of electron–hole
pair, (ii) scattering in metals during relaxation of excited electron
and hole on new states of energy, and (iii) finally, electron–hole
recombination.25 In the present case, the
localized d electrons (act as donor) are excited on the gold surface,
and simultaneously holes (act as acceptor) are created due to the
trapped energy associated on the surface states of Au NRs. Moreover,
this recombination occurs between the electrons and holes present
near to Fermi surface and in d band, respectively. The emissions are
observed at 609 and 510 nm wavelengths for the regions of the X and L symmetry points, respectively,
in first BZ. These observed peaks correspond to electron–hole
recombination near X and L symmetry
points, and the ratio of intensity of these peaks (IX/IL) is ∼0.3. Electromagnetic
local density of states (LDOS) is exposed by this spectral intensity
of the nanorods, and the LDOS is associated with SP modes (eigenfunctions)
in nanorods due to difference in plasmon mode excitation.25 The as-synthesized Au NRs were also characterized
by performing fluorescence PL mapping imaging; Figure 2b shows the luminescent signature of Au NRs
and the inset shows the enlarged view of bundle of gold nanorods,
which is systematically aligned in horizontal path. The PL mapping
image and the associated PL emission spectra (excitation wavelength
at 375 nm) of Au NRs are shown in Figure S4a,b (see the Supporting Information). These
spectra are taken at different places of PL mapping image.

The TAS and dynamics studies of
electron in plasmon modes for Au
NRs have been performed by ultrafast spectroscopy. The low-energy
pump fluences were used for avoiding the undesirable thermal effects
in the aqueous medium. In TAS experiment, a pump beam excites the
electrons so that the plasmonic oscillations occur and their subsequent
dynamics changes have been investigated by time-delayed probe beam.
These studies have been performed in the visible pump pulses centered
at wavelength 410 nm and visible and near-infrared (NIR) probe pulses
and fixed pump pulse energy at 0.35 mW. The TA spectra with varying
delay times, 0–125 ps, in visible wavelength probe pulses are
shown in Figure 3a.
The visible light pumping excites the gold solution, and the bleaching
effect occurs due to the excitation of electrons into the conduction
band, i.e., interband transition. This pumping effect increases the
electron temperature due to moments of electrons in the gold nanostructures.
These coherent oscillations correspond to acoustic vibrations of the
nanorods.9−11 The bleaching peak intensity rises from 0 to 750
fs and then it reduces from 1.01 to 125 ps. It means that electrons
and holes are accumulated for 750 fs time period in the conduction
band. This enhances the plasmon band and transient bleaching state
at a band maximum 540 nm in negative signal, whereas positive absorption
arises centered at 490 and 580 nm. The bleaching peak wavelengths
are shifted to the longer-wavelength side with increment in delay
time. It means that the length of the Au NRs is increased due to lattice
heating. The acoustic phonon vibrations occur due to the oscillations
in bleaching peaks, which result in the increase of electron temperature,
thereby also changing the dielectric constant.9 In the present investigation, gold solution is excited under low
wavelength (410 nm) and the absorbed energy is divided into two modes
(longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and transverse surface
plasmon resonance (TSPR)). Further, initially, the bleaching in LSPR
mode occurs under low excitation. After saturation of the LSPR mode,
the absorbed energy will transfer to the TSPR mode, which increases
the bleaching of the TSPR band.11 Hence,
the electron–phonon relaxation time corresponding to the TSPR
mode is less compared to the LSPR mode under low excitation, which
is strongly correlated with bleaching amplitude. Basically, bleaching
amplitude depends on the quantity of the redistributed energies. Thus,
the TSPR mode absorbs a large amount of energy and leads to increase
in bleaching signal with lower damping rate.

ps. (b) Transient kinetics decay spectra traces at 480, 538, 596,
687, and 758 nm and (c) their corresponding fitting curves for gold
nanorods solution (visible pump pulses at 410 nm wavelength; visible
light probe pulse and fixed pump pulse energy, 0.35 mW).

For time delay studies of the bleaching peaks,
the visible transient
kinetics spectra and their corresponding fitting curves of gold nanorods
solution are shown in Figure 3b,c. The polarity is positive near zero delay, i.e., ELSP < Eprobe.
In comparison, ΔT/T is negative, ELSP > Eprobe,
and
photoinduced absorption occurs for the other wavelength. The interaction
between transient photobleaching and photoinduced absorption with
respect to the difference between ELSP–Eprobe can be clearly stated
by a model complex dielectric function ε(ω), which represents
the contributions of free electrons (Drude part) and bound electrons
(interband part). The decay curve clearly explains the plasmon-induced
hot electron relaxation process, in which electron–electron
scattering, fast electron–phonon scattering, and slow phonon–phonon
scattering take place.9 The decay time
is calculated by the relaxation process of plasmon-induced hot electrons,
i.e., the outcome from the heat exchange to the crystal lattice and
then to the surrounding medium. Further, the time delay spectra are
fitted by using biexponential decay function; their corresponding
fitting components are given in the Supporting Information as Table ST1, which
is of the order a few picoseconds, similarly to the earlier published
results for Au NRs. The other research group also reported the TAS
studies on Au NRs at 410 nm excitation wavelength and observed that
the transient bleaching of TSPR and LSPR absorptions show similar
intensity results to previous studies.9−11,17−20

Figure 4a shows
the TA spectra for NIR wavelength with varying delay times of 0–5.49
ns. The NIR wavelength light pumping excites the gold solution. The
oscillations occur in the bleaching peaks with time. The bleaching
peak intensity rises from 0 to 747 fs, and then it reduces from 1.02
to 5.49 ns. This enhances the plasmon band, and transient bleaching
state appears at band maximum 918 nm in positive absorption signal.
The bleaching peak wavelengths are shifted to the lower-wavelength
side with increment in delay time, which may be due to hot electron
pressure and expansion in TSPR mode. These coherent oscillations correspond
to acoustic phonon vibrations in breathing mode of the Au nanorods.9−11Figure 4b,c shows
the decay times for Au NRs calculated from the triexponential fitting
curve, and the NIR transient kinetics spectra and their corresponding
fitting curve for gold nanorods solution. Further, the time delay
spectra are fitted by using triexponential decay function; their corresponding
fitting components are given in the Supporting Information as Table ST2. Thus,
this is the most popular method to determine the time constants of
various electron–phonon relaxation processes after photoexcitation
of SPR modes of Au NRs.

nm and (c) their corresponding fitting curves for gold nanorods solution
(visible pump pulses at 410 nm wavelength; NIR light probe pulse and
fixed pump pulse energy, 0.35 mW).

Furthermore, the analysis of the pump–probe data is
basically
associated with the optical properties of the nanorods, which are
altered due to the thermal-induced heating from laser. The laser pulse
is incident on the plasmon Au NRs. Then, the decay phenomenon occur
instantaneously due to the absorption of energy, which increases the
temperature of conduction electrons in the rods. These electrons transfer
heat to the Au lattice, and then this lattice exchanges heat with
its surroundings through electron–phonon scattering and phonon–phonon
scattering.9 The heat capacity of the surroundings
acts as a source for the electrons and phonons to reach the final
state at room temperature. Therefore, this electron temperature increase
leads to transfer of the electrons above the Fermi energy, EF, increases the number of energy levels below EF for interband and intraband transitions, and
finally widens the Drude response.9 It
is also well established that interband transition in gold nanorods
occurs from the d band into s–p band above the Fermi level,
after excitation with 410 nm pulse wavelength.9−11 As an outcome
of this, the generated localized d band holes and electrons from conduction
band are recombined within the range of few tens of femtoseconds.
Further, the TSPR and LSPR bands are excited at the same time due
to the absorption of energy. The electrons transfer to the conduction
band, which leads to transient absorption phenomenon. Hence, these
results clearly show that TAS provides a deep explanation of the optical
characteristics of the probed medium.

Conclusions
In
summary, ultrafast time-resolved TAS studies are performed to
know the dynamics of SPR band in Au NRs. The Au NRs are synthesized
using a seed-mediated growth method, having average width and length
of ∼10 ± 2 and ∼50 ± 2 nm, respectively. The
Au NRs reveal a TSPR band in the visible region at 530 nm wavelength
and an LSPR band in the NIR at 825 nm wavelength. The Au NRs are excited
under 410 nm pump wavelength and probed with different visible and
NIR wavelengths. The results explain the lifetime of electron–phonon
recombination and phonon–phonon scattering, which is in the
order of picosecond for the Au NRs. The heating in Au NRs lattice
and lattice phonon interactions occur in visible and NIR probes, which
dominate the oscillations of bleaching peaks to the extensional and
breathing mode of the coherent acoustic phonon vibration for Au NRs,
respectively. Thus, these deep insights into the optical dynamic nature
of nanorods via ultrafast studies prove them as a promising candidate
for various applications, including optoelectronics, sensing, contrast-enhanced
imaging, and cancer therapeutics.

Materials and Method
Materials
Chloroauric acid (HAuCl4·4H2O, 99.99%),
silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.8%), l-ascorbic acid
(99.7%), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%),
sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%), sodium oleate (NaOL, >97%),
and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis). Deionized water (DI) water (resistivity,
18.2 MΩ cm) was used as the solvent medium throughout the experiment.

Synthesis of Gold Nanorods
The crystalline cylindrical
gold nanorods (Au NRs) with LSPR band peak maximum at 825 nm have
been synthesized using a seed-mediated growth method. For particular
aspect ratio of nanorods, the synthesis depends on various factors
such as the quantity and size of seed particles, as well as pH and
concentration of the solution. First, for the preparation of seed
solution, HAuCl4 solution (5.0 mL, 0.5 mM) was added into
aqueous solution of CTAB (5.0 mL, 0.2 M) with continuous stirring
at room temperature. Subsequently, a freshly prepared, ice-cold NaBH4 aqueous solution (1.0 mL, 6.0 mM) was then immediately added
into the mixture under vigorous stirring. Then, the prepared seed
solution was stirred for 1–2 min and then left undisturbed
at room temperature for 2 h. The change in color of the seed solution
from yellow to brownish yellow indicates the formation of Au nanoparticles
with diameters ranging between 5 and 8 nm. Further, for growth solution,
CTAB (7.2 g) and NaOL (1.2 g) were dissolved in 250 mL of DI water.
Then, the solution was cooled at room temperature and AgNO3 solution (18 mL, 4.0 mM) was mixed. The mixture was kept undisturbed
for 15 min, followed by the addition of HAuCl4 solution
(250 mL, 1.0 mM). The solution became colorless after 100 min of magnetic
stirring. A certain amount of HCl aqueous solution was added into
the solution. After another 15 min of slow magnetic stirring, the
freshly prepared l-ascorbic acid solution (1.25 mL, 64 mM)
is mixed to reduce Au(III) to Au(I). Finally, after 2 min of stirring,
0.8 mL of the Au seed solution was added into the obtained growth
solution. Afterward, this mixed solution was vigorously stirred for
few more seconds and then the resulting solution was placed under
room temperature without disturbance for 12 h. After completion of
the growth process, the prepared Au NRs were centrifuged at high speed
for 30 min to remove the supernatant, and this process was repeated
two times to remove the excess of supernatant. Finally, the obtained
precipitate was redispersed in DI water for further characterization.

Characterization
Transmission electron micrography
(TEM) was performed (JEOL JEM 200 CX model operated at 200 kV) to
determine the structure and aspect ratio of the as-synthesized Au
NRs. A high-resolution UV–vis spectrophotometer (MODEL No.
LS 55) was used to measure UV–visible spectra. XPS analysis
was carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber equipped with a hemispherical
electron energy analyzer (PerkinElmer, PHI1257) using nonmonochromatized
Al Kα source. The photoluminescence (PL) and PL mapping were
studied by WITec α 300R+ Confocal PL microscope system (WITec
GnBH, Ulm, Germeny).

Ultrafast Transient Absorption (TA) Spectroscopy
To
study the electron dynamics behavior in Au NRs, TA measurements were
performed by femtosecond spectroscopy using pump–probe configuration.
The system comprises a cavity-dumped Ti:sapphire oscillator (Micra
from Coherent), Ti:sapphire amplifier (Legend from Coherent), optical
parametric amplifier (OPA from Light Conversion), and spectroscopy
system (Helios from Ultrafast Systems). Briefly, Ti:sapphire oscillator
is used to generate 4 mJ (1 kHz) energy, ∼35 fs pulse width
centered at a wavelength of 800 nm. The output pulse was divided into
two beams using a beam splitter, where one part of the 800 nm beam
acted as the pump beam that goes through OPA to produce the 410 nm
pump beam. Another part of the 800 nm beam was fed to a spectrometer
to produce a wide-band white-light continuum probe pulse by passing
through a combination of sapphire and CaF2 crystals. Finally,
the OPA output generates a highly stable beam of 410 nm wavelength,
selected as a pump beam, and pump energy is fixed at about 0.35 mW.
The data observed from the experiments were analyzed using Surface
Xplorer software.
