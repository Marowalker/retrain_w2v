The
hypercoordinated silicon chlorides ClSi[(o-OC6H4)3N] (3) and
ClSi[(OC6H2Me2CH2)3N] (5) were used for the synthesis of catenated
derivatives (Me3Si)3SiSi[(o-OC6H4)3N] (9), (Me3Si)3SiSiMe2SiMe2Si(SiMe3)2Si[(o-OC6H4)3N] (11), and (Me3Si)3SiSi[(OC6H2Me2CH2)3N] (13) in reactions with (Me3Si)3SiK·THF (7) or (Me3Si)3SiK·[18-crown-6] (8). It was found that the nature
of the (Me3Si)3SiK solvate determines the product
of interaction, resulting in the formation of (Me3Si)3Si(CH2)4OSi[(OC6H2Me2CH2)3N] (12) or 13. Compounds obtained were characterized using multinuclear
NMR and UV–vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The molecular
structures of 3, 9, and 11–13 were investigated by single-crystal X-ray analysis, featuring
hypercoordinated Si atoms in a trigonal-bipyramidal coordination environment
with O atoms in the equatorial plane. The structure of the side product
[N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3Si]2O (6) was also studied, indicating highly
tetrahedrally distorted trigonal-bipyramidal environment at the Si
atoms, which was confirmed by crystal density functional theory calculations
indicating the very weak Si ← N interaction. The Si···N
interatomic distances span a broad range (2.23–2.78 Å).
The dependence of structural and NMR parameters for hypercoordinated
catenated compounds from the type of the ligand was established.

Introduction
Currently,
the organometallic chemistry of group 14 elements (E
= Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; E(IV)) comprises two main directions of development,
including catenated (containing E–E bonds)1 and hypercoordinated (with coordination number of E being
higher than 4)2 compounds. This is due
to academic interest and also due to broad practical applications
in chemistry.3 Work with silicon compounds
serves as a model of other group 14 derivatives but is also advantageous
with respect to its special features (like magnetic activity of 29Si), high abundance, and low cost for possible practical
application.

In general, hypercoordination of chemical compounds
is usually
achieved by applying special ligands, like triethanolamine, N(CH2CH2OH)3, resulting in this case in the
formation of atrane molecules.4 Compounds
of this type are very valuable in various fields such as organic synthesis,5 medicine,6 sol–gel
techniques,7 and material chemistry.8 The increased stability of such derivatives based
on tetradentate O3N-type ligands is a characteristic feature.
Nevertheless, application of other ON-polydentate ligands for hypercoordinated
Si compounds (like tridentate iminophenols,9 tridentate alkanoloaminophenols,10 tetradentate
salens,11 and others) is also known. Furthermore,
there are several cases of application of other types of O3N ligands, like aminotrisphenols,12 homotrialkanolamines,13 and aminotris(alkylphenol)s14 or alkanolaminobis(phenol)s15 for Si derivatives.

Influence of hypercoordination on the
structure and UV–vis
absorption properties of oligosilane properties was studied previously
by El-Sayed et al. who utilized amide side chains.16 Extending the types of ligands in the synthesis of catenated
derivatives increases the range of substances and their possible application,
and it opens new possibilities to study structure–property
relationships. Due to σ-conjugation along the E–E bonds,
catenated compounds exhibit useful properties, such as luminescence,17 conductivity,18 and
so on. Therefore, the synthesis of a wide range of catenated hypercoordinated
compounds may be regarded as an actual scientific area of interest.

Although some hypercoordinated oligosilanes based on polydentate
ligands are known and even have found application (e.g., in cross-coupling
reactions19), in general their range is
really very narrow20−22 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Known Hypercoordinated Oligosilanes Based on Polydentate
Ligands
The aim of the present
work is the synthesis of molecular hypercoordinated
oligosilanes, based on polydentate aminophenols, and the establishment
of their structures and properties. In continuation of our works on
hypercoordinated group 14 catenated derivatives,1f,23,22a,22b,24 the synthesis of molecular oligosilanes 9–11 and 13 is reported in this work.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
In the current study,
two types of ligands,
aminotrisphenols 1 and 2, were used (Scheme 2). These ligands
are phenols and therefore significantly different in structure from
previously investigated trialkanolamine derivatives; furthermore,
they are also different with respect to the nature of the donating
nitrogen atom, which is either bound directly to the aromatic ring
(as in 1) or not (in 2). Ligand 1 forms rigid five-membered chelates with a Si atom, while ligand 2 forms more flexible six-membered chelates. This structural
difference may result in divergent properties in silatranes based
on 1 and 2.

Scheme 2 Ligands 1 and 2, Used for the Synthesis
of Hypercoordinated Oligosilanes
Both compounds are known, but for 1,12a an improved synthetic protocol and analytical
data are
provided (for details, see the Experimental Section).

According to previous experiments, the best way for the
attachment
of the silatrane unit to a polysilane chain is to react a silatranyl
electrophile containing a suitable leaving group with a silanide.19a,22a Therefore, silatranyl-like chlorides 3 and 5 were obtained at the first stage. Chloride 3 was prepared
following the procedure reported by Frye et al. (Scheme 3).12a Removal of the formed HCl in this case is possible due to low basicity
of the anilinic N of 1. Compound 3 was isolated
as a beige powder, stable in dry atmosphere and sparingly soluble
in polar common organic solvents (chloroform, dichloromethane).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Hypercoordinated Chlorosilanes 3 and 5
Despite the successful
synthesis of 3, similar synthetic
ways to 5 did not work out. Neither reaction of silyl
ether N(CH2C6H2Me2OSiMe3)3 with SiCl4 under prolonged heating
in toluene, as was used for the synthesis of ClSi(OCH2CH2)3N,22a nor reaction
of free N(CH2C6H2Me2OH)3 with SiCl4 in the presence of Et3N
did result in formation of the target compound. The synthesis of each
hypercoordinated derivative critically depends on the type of the
ligand used. An alternative procedure was devised, involving synthesis
of alkoxy derivative 4 according to the literature procedure
reported by Holmes et al.,14a followed
by chlorination as known for related compounds.25 Thus, MeOSi[(OC6H2Me2CH2)3N] (4) was reacted with excess thionyl
chloride for 18 h to obtain [N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3]SiCl (5) (Scheme 3).

Compound 5 was isolated as a white powder, soluble
in common organic solvents, which much to our surprise is highly moisture
sensitive. During the crystallization of 5 from chloroform
at ambient conditions, crystals of hydrolyzed product, HCl·N(CH2C6H2Me2OH)3 (2·HCl) (Figure S1, Supporting
Information (SI)), were obtained. Furthermore, during recrystallization
of the reaction mixture after synthesis of 13 (Scheme 6; see below), crystals
of [N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3Si]2O (6) (Figure 2), suitable for single-crystal X-ray analysis,
were obtained (Scheme 4); in this case, 6 was formed from unreacted 5. The formation of different products under random hydrolysis of
hypercoordinated 5 is explained by the appearance or
presence of trace amounts of acidic or basic catalysts4a,26,56 under reaction conditions.14c It should be noted that related O[Si(o-OC6H4)3N]2 may be obtained by hydrolysis of AcOSi(o-OC6H4)3N.12a

Scheme 4 Schematic Representation of Random Hydrolysis of 5
For the synthesis of the targeted
hypercoordinated oligosilanes,
in a second step chlorides 3 and 5 were
reacted with potassium silanide reagents. Thus, oligosilanylsilatrane 9 was prepared by reaction of oligosilanylpotassium 7 with ClSi(o-OC6H4)3N (3) (Scheme 5). NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixture
showed exclusive formation of 9 without any observable
side products, like hydrosilane (Me3Si)3SiH.
In contrast, the reaction of oligosilanylpotassium 7 with
1-chlorosilatrane ClSi(OCH2CH2)3N
did not proceed cleanly22a due to its lower
reactivity, explained by the unusual geometry.27

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Compounds 9–11 Using
Silyl Potassium Reagents
Compound 9 was successfully metallated by t-BuOK/18-crown-6 giving 10, which is sufficiently
stable and was characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy (for
details, see the Experimental Section); compounds
related to 10 may be used for the synthesis of other
derivatives. Thus, metallation of 9 with in situ formation
of the related potassium reagent followed by reaction with (Me3Si)3SiSiMe2SiMe2Cl gave compound 11 (Scheme 5).

In contrast to the synthesis of 9, reaction
of oligosilanylpotassium
reagent 7 with [N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3]SiCl (5) unexpectedly gave
oligosilanylsilatrane 12 (Scheme 6). According to crystal
structure analysis of 12 (Figure 4), tetrahydrofuran (THF) ring opening occurred,
with the oxygen atom of the THF attached to the hypercoordinated silicon
atom and the α-carbon atom of THF bound to the oligosilanyl
unit.

Scheme 6 Synthesis of 12 and 13 by Reaction
of Chloride 5 with Oligosilanylpotassium Reagents 7 and 8
The formation of oligosilanylsilatrane 12 is a typical
case of THF opening in the presence of strong Lewis acids. We have
observed related chemistry previously for instance in the reaction
of silanide 7 and related substances with HfCl428 and YbI2.24 In this occasion, compound 5 may be regarded
as Lewis acid also (compare with the results of Holmes and co-workers,
who have reported a new class of silatrane-like molecules [N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3]SiX
(X = Me, OMe, Ph, CCl3)14a with
acidic Si atoms). Coordination of THF to 5 activates
the α-position of THF toward the nucleophilic attack of silanide 7, which then is the actual ring-opening event.

Oligosilanylsilatrane 13 was eventually prepared by
reaction of tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl potassium·18-crown-6 (8) with [N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3]SiCl (5) (Scheme 6). To avoid THF ring opening such as in the
previous reaction, oligosilylanylpotassium 8 was prepared
in toluene in the presence of 18-crown-6. Therefore, the course of
the reaction with silyl potassium reagents strongly depends on the
nature of this reagent.

The difference in reactivities of 3 and 5 toward oligosilanides deserves additional
explanation. Explanation
including “spillover effect”29 (increase of acidity of hypercoordinated group 14 center) may be
regarded as implausible. Apparently, the increase of this bond length
of 5 is explained by the more flexible ligand framework
and also is based on the dissociation of N → Si interaction
(compare with dynamic NMR behavior and in related derivatives based
on X-ray diffraction (XRD); see below) with significant geometry distortion
at Si (from five- to four-coordinated) and thereby increase of acidity
(“strain release Lewis acidity”).30

Compounds 9, 11, 12, and 13 were isolated as colorless crystalline
materials, stable
under ambient conditions and soluble in common organic solvents. The
identities of compounds were established by elemental analysis and
mass spectrometry (MS), and structures were studied by multinuclear
NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 29Si)
in solution; X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis (XRD) was used
for investigation of structures 2·HCl (Figure S1, Supporting Information), 3, 6, 9, and 11–13 in
solid state. The degree of conjugation along the Si–Si bond
was studied by UV–vis spectroscopy.

Crystal Structures
The molecular structures of compounds 3, 6, 9, and 11–13 (Figures 1–6) in the solid state were investigated
by single-crystal XRD analysis. A main question in the investigation
of these structures is the study of the level of N → SiO3–X interaction, its influence on the trans-Si–X
bond, and the establishment of coordination geometry around the central
Si atom (tetrahedral vs trigonal bipyramidal (TBP)). It should be
noted that for the case of catenated compounds, the rules, found earlier
for silatranes (more electron-withdrawing groups X in N → Si–X
fragment result in shortening of the Si–N bond), are not so
evident due to the equal nature of silicon atoms (X = SiR3). According to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD, February
2018),31 the Si–N bond varies within
1.96532–2.33322b Å in silatranes, within 2.02514a–2.83914b in benzyl silatrane-like
molecules based on 2 and related ligands, and within
2.256–2.34412b Å for phenylene
silatrane-like molecules based on 1 and related ligands,
wherein for the last case the variation range is the smallest one
due to the rigid structure of the ligand. XRD investigations indicate
that substitution of the ethylene bridge in silatranes by phenylene
and benzylene groups results in increased Si–N distances.2a

Chlorosilatrane-like molecule 3 (Figure 2) was found to crystallize in the monoclinic space group P21/n. The geometry around the
Si atom may be described as slightly (angle Cl(1)–Si(1)–N(1)
is 179.23(5)°, the sum of angles at Si atom is 356.15°)
distorted trigonal bipyramid (TBP-5) with Cl and N atoms in apical
positions; in general, the molecule possesses approximate C3 symmetry. The N atom of 3 adopts
a tetrahedral geometry (angle’s sum is 344.38°). Although
the structure of chlorosilatrane-like molecule 3, due
to the presence of phenyl groups, is not as flexible (the plane of
each C6H4 cycle is coplanar with condensed five-membered
chelate ring) as the structure of silatranes with alkylamine groups,
XSi(OCH2CH2)3N, the Si–N bond
length in 3 (2.2125 Å) is significantly longer than
the Si–N bond in ClSi(OCH2CH2)3N (2.023 Å)27 or in ClSi(OC6H2Me(t-Bu)CH2)3N (2.045 Ǻ).14c This in fact
shows to some extent the mobility of the Si–N bond even in
the presence of three phenyl groups in the structure of 3. Another difference among the structures of ClSi(o-OC6H4)3N (3), ClSi(OCH2CH2)3N, and ClSi(OC6H2Me(t-Bu)CH2)3N is the
difference of Si–Cl bond lengths (2.0707, 2.153, and 2.180
Å, respectively), whereas Si–O bonds (alkoxide and phenoxide)
are almost identical (1.6528, 1.649, and 1.629 Å). Comparison
of these three related structures indicates the dependence of the
structural parameters from the ligand used, where the flexibility
of the chelate rings is the most important.

[N(CH2C6H2Me2O)3Si]2O (6) in
the crystal (top: view perpendicular to the Si–O–Si
axis; bottom: view along the Si–O–Si axis). There are
two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for
clarity. Selected interatomic distances (Å) and angles (deg):

179.97(3), and N(1)–Si(1)–O(2) 75.90(4).

Compound 6 (Figure 2) crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3̅; the molecule occupies a threefold axis. According
to the Cambridge Crystallographic Database (CSD), structures with
SiV–O–SiV coordination motif are
very rare,26c,33 and there are no structures with
SiNO4 coordination of such type. The main features of 6 consist of an almost linear N–Si–O–Si–N
fragment and a staggered conformation of two NSiO3 frameworks
along the Si–O–Si bond, which may be explained by steric
reasons. The introduction of two voluminous Si(OC6H2Me2CH2)3N units to O not
only contributes to its linearity, but also led to sufficient increase
of the Si–N distance (2.7730 in 6 vs 2.633 Å
in related MeOSi(OC6H2Me2CH2)3N)14a and Si–Oeq bonds (1.6274 vs 1.616 Å), whereas the Si–Oax distances are almost identical (1.6094 vs 1.609 Å).
At the same time, C–N–Si–O are almost in eclipsed
conformation in deference of other cases. Apparently, there is very
weak N → Si interaction in 6 (2.7730 vs 1.965–2.838
Å, typical for silatranes and related compounds; see above),2a and the Si atom has a highly tetrahedrally distorted
trigonal-bipyramidal geometry, which was additionally confirmed by
crystal density functional theory (DFT) calculations (see below).
Six-membered chelate OSiNC3 cycles are in almost ideal
boat conformations, where the O and CH2 units are the ones
that moved out of the plane formed by the other atoms.

According
to the crystallographic data of oligosilanylsilatrane 9 (Figure 3), two molecules
of 9 with noticeably different structural
parameters are in the asymmetric unit in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The Si–N bond length increases
from 2.2125 Å in ClSi(o-OC6H4)3N (3) or 2.292 Å in (Me3Si)3SiSi(OCH2CH2)3N22a to 2.455 and 2.509 Å in oligosilanylsilatrane 9, which shows the flexibility of the silatrane cage and the
mobility of nitrogen atom even in the presence of three rigid phenylene
groups. In reverse Si–SiO3 bond lengths decrease
from 2.3509 Å in (Me3Si)3SiSi(OCH2CH2)3N to 2.3096 and 2.3245 Å in oligosilanylsilatrane 9. This fact can be explained by the electron-withdrawing
character of the phenylene groups in the ligand framework. Unequal
values of three O(x)–Si(1)–O(x′) angles (for details, see the Supporting Information) in spite of approximate C3 symmetry in the structure along the Si–SiO3 bond is due to torsion in the silatranyl group, which is
created by three rigid phenylene groups. In 9, the hypercoordinated
silicon atoms Si(1)/Si(6) have a distorted TBP-5 geometry with N and
Si(2) atoms in apical positions.

117.95(16), and C(24)–N(2)–Si(6) 99.78(16).

For 9, the whole molecule has a staggered
conformation
along Si(1)–Si(2) bond (torsion Si–Si(2)–Si(1)–O
is 65.21(8)/54.78(8)°). The nitrogen atom is highly flattened
(sum of the angles is 351.22/353.70°). The five-membered chelate
cycles are in distorted envelope conformation with Si atom as a flap.

For 11 (monoclinic space group P21/c; Figure 4), the Si–SiO3 bond is shortened (2.319 vs 2.347–2.377 Å) in comparison
with the other ones. The nitrogen atom is again highly flattened (sum
of the angles is 350.31°). The geometry of hypercoordinated Si(2)
may be described as distorted TBP-5 with the oxygen atoms in the equatorial
plane; five-membered chelate rings are in envelope conformations with
Si as a valve. Conformation along Si–Si–Si–O
is staggered (torsions are 42.53/77.47°); σ-conjugation
along the Si–Si bonds is possible (angle Si–Si–Si
varies in the 111–118° range; 120° for the ideal
conjugation), but the terminal silicon atoms deviate from the planarity
with the central ones. Comparison of the structural parameters of 9 and 11 indicates that the elongation of the
silicon chain as substituent at hypercoordinated Si atom resulted
in significant changes in the Si–N bond, which may be explained
by steric and packing reasons.

114.46(3), and Si(9)–Si(7)–Si(6) 114.12(3).

According to the crystallographic data, there are
two molecules
of oligosilanylsilatrane 12 in the asymmetric unit; the
structural parameters are significantly different possibly due to
packing effects (Figure 5). Compound 12 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P1̅, where the coordination geometry of Si(5) may
be described as TBP-5 with N and O(1) in apical positions. Si–N
bonds of 2.527 and 2.717 Å and O–SiO3 bonds
of 1.644 and 1.619 Å, respectively, were observed, which means
that the structure with a shorter Si–N bond has a longer O–SiO3 bond, and in contrast, the structure with a longer Si–N
bond has a shorter O–SiO3 bond. This in fact is
in accordance with Gordon’s rule.34 Unequal values of three O(x)–Si(5)–O(x′) angles (for details, see the Supporting Information) with close to 10° difference
are mainly caused by the alkylene chain of THF, which is located between
the silatranyl and (Me3Si)3Si groups. In contrast
to three unequal O(x)–Si(5)–O(x′), three C(x)–N(1)–C(x′) angles are very close to each other. Although
the O(x)–Si(5)–O(x′) units are under steric tension, the torsion does not transfer
to the three C(x)–N(1)–C(x′) angles due to the flexibility of the silatranyl ligand.
The six-membered chelate rings are in boat conformation with O and
CH2 as valves. Comparing the structural parameters of 12 (both molecules) to those of 6 indicates significant
changes in Si–N bond length (2.527, 2.717 vs 2.773 Å)
but only insignificantly influences the equatorial Si–O bonds
(1.630, 1.628 vs 1.6274 Å), whereas the changes in axial Si–O
bonds are more significant (1.644, 1.619 vs 1.6094 Å, respectively),

The molecule of oligosilanylsilatrane 13 (Figure 6) crystallizes in the trigonal space group P3̅c1. Due to the presence of a symmetry
axis
along the N–Si–Si bond, three O(x)–Si(1)–O(x′) angles as well as three C(x)–N(1)–C(x′) angles are equal to each other (for details,
see the Supporting Information). However,
the related oligosilanylsilatrane (Me3Si)3SiSi(OCH2CH2)3N22a with the trialkylamine ligand or oligosilanylsilatrane 9 with the triphenylenamine ligand are symmetric molecules, but a
symmetric crystal structure was not observed in their case.

The hypercoordinated
atom Si(1) in 13 features trigonal
bipyramidal (TBP-5) geometry with oxygen atoms in equatorial positions.
The torsional angles along Si–Si–Si–O (torsions
are 56.71/63.36°) indicate a staggered conformation; six-membered
chelate cycles are in half-chair conformation with N and CH2 in vertices.

It is interesting to compare structural
data for the related catenated
derivatives 13, (Me3Si)3SiSi(OCH2CH2)3N,22a and 9 with the hypercoordinated Si atom in a similar
SiSiO3N coordination environment. Elongation
of Si ← N bonds apparently is caused by the rigid ligand structure
(geometric reason) (2.237 in 13, 2.292 in (Me3Si)3SiSi(OCH2CH2)3N,
and 2.455/2.509 Å in 9) and accompanied by shortening
of the Si–Si (2.3770 vs 2.3509 vs 2.3245/2.3096 Å) bond.
At the same time, Si–O bonds (1.6669 vs 1.650 vs 1.6565/1.6523
Å) are changed not so evidently, possibly due to packing effects,
although the same tendency is visible. Anyway, the similarity of Si–O
bond for alkoxides and phenoxides of such types should be mentioned.

Using data for 3 and 6, it is evident
that the XSi ← N bond length depends on the electron properties
of X (electron-withdrawing groups result in shortening)34,35 but also on the steric size of X (increasing size of X results in
elongation of X–Si and Si ← N). The Bader analysis of
the theoretical electron density showed the presence of the bond critical
point between the Si and N atoms. The electron density equals to 0.056
au for 3 and 0.021 au for 6. The energies
of the Si ← N interaction are 43.5 and 14.2 kJ/mol for 3 and 6, respectively. It should be noted that
in related atranes, N(CH2CH2O)3SiSi(SiMe3)2R (R = H, Me, Et, Ph, SiMe3, SiMe2SiMe3, Si(OCH2CH2)3N), the Si–N bond distances are in the 2.15–2.42 Å
range.22 For oligosilanylsilatrane-like
molecules 9 and 11 based on ligand 1, this bond is significantly elongated (up to 2.41–2.51
Å), whereas for 13, based on ligand 2, the Si–N distance is in accord with typical hypercoordinated
interaction. Anyway, in all compounds, the interaction is present,
even in 6, despite a long Si–N distance. These
data clearly indicate the dependence of structural parameters on the
ligand electronic and geometric properties. The insertion of N atom
into the conjugation with O by phenylene as in 1 results
in decreased electron-withdrawing properties of alkoxides at the Si
atom. The Si–Si(O)3 bonds in 9, 11, and 13 vary between 2.30 and 2.39 Å,
which correlates with data for single Si–Si bond length. The
Si–O bonds in 9, 11, and 13 based on aminotrisphenols are in the range of 1.65–1.68 Å,
typical for oligosilanylsiltranes,22a indicating
a weak effect of conjugation of O with aryl group in phenols on Si
geometry. The similarity in the Si–N bond length for 13 and classical silatrane N(CH2CH2O)3SiSi(SiMe3)3 reflects the role of fluxional
behavior of five- and six-membered chelate rings, which is not restricted
by ring constraints.

Generalized structural data for 3, 6, 9, and 11–13 and several
related derivatives are presented in Table 1, where Δ is the displacement of the
silatrane Si atom with respect to the plane formed by the equatorial
O atoms (positive values indicate an out-of-plane displacement toward
N).

It should be noted that the main dependence is evident
from these
data. Attachment of the bulky X group to the central Si atom results
not only in Si–X elongation in X–Si ← N but also
in increased Si ← N distances. The flexibility of the ligand
framework, arising from the nonrigidity and increased size of the
chelate cycles, is able to compensate steric interaction (appearing
in increasing Δ, Si ← N distance, and O–Si–N–C
torsion). It results in elongation of Δ with lengthening of
Si ← N.36 As was observed earlier,
elongation of the Si–N distance is connected to shifting the
Si atom from the O3 plane and not to movement of the N atom away from
this plane. At the same time, all these relationships are discussible
especially due to the high impact of crystal packing effects on the
structural parameters (e.g., see two different molecules for 12).

Structure in Solution
In general,
the NMR spectra of
hypercoordinated compounds 3–5 and 9–13 indicate that in solution, the structure
corresponds to that found in a crystal. It should be noted that for 13, dynamic behavior is observed in solution. Thus, at room
temperature (rt), the signals for the NCH(H) group in 1H NMR appear as singlet (δ 3.67 ppm, 6H; fast H–H exchange
on the NMR time scale). On cooling to −40 °C, these protons
become diastereotopic (δ 4.44 and 2.94 ppm, both d, J 14.5 Hz, each 3H). Apparently, this is explained by fast
conformation transitions of the chelate six-membered cycles (pseudorotation
with exchange of axial-equatorial protons).14c,26c,37 Crude estimation of rate constants
can be obtained from these spectral data using approximate formulas,14a giving at −40 °C ΔG≠ 9.2 kcal/mol with t1/2 0.3 ms. In contrast to this, for 9 and 11, based on aminotrisphenol 1, a rigid structure
is observed.

Comparing 29Si NMR chemical shift values
(Table 2) for 3–5, 9–13, and several known related compounds indicates the dependence of
the experimental data on the structure of the ligand used. Interaction
between Si and N atoms results in upfield shifts of 29Si
NMR signals of the SiO3 fragment,22a as is evident from a comparison of chemical shifts for

Si(OPh)4, 4, and 12. Comparing
the NMR data for ClSi(OCH2CH2)3N, 2 and 5, and for 9, 11, and 13, indicates the strong dependence of chemical
shift of hypercoordinated Si atoms from the ligand structure; the
nature of the exocyclic substituent at Si atom14b has a weaker effect. For chlorides, the transfer from trialkanolamine
to aminotrisphenol backbones 1 and 2 causes
an upfield shift (−85.8 vs −97.8 vs −124.5 ppm),
indicating an increasing electronic interaction among O, Si, and N
atoms. In the corresponding potassium anions,22a the Si–N interaction is largely diminished, as is
evident by critical downfield shift of the 29Si NMR signal.
The related correlation is observed for oligosilanyl hypercoordinated
derivatives (Me3Si)3SiSi(OCH2CH2)3N, 9, 11, and 13. Consistent with the solid-state data, in solution, the
weak N → Si interaction in 9 and 11, based on aminotrisphenol 1, causes small shielding
(−45.9 ppm in 9), whereas the strong Si–N
interaction of 13 is reflected by a more shielded resonance
at −107.7 ppm.

compounds 9 and 11–13 and related (MeO)3SiSi(SiMe3)3 (14) are presented

It is
known that the absorption of a trisilane unit occurs at approximately
210 nm, and usually this band is out of registration window. Apparently,
the modification of the nature of the ligand at Si(OR)3 (OMe vs (OCH2CH2)3N vs (o-OC6H4)3N vs (OC6H2Me2CH2)3N) may affect
UV–vis absorption and, therefore, the changing of highest occupied
molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels. The
effect of weakly hypercoordinated groups is insignificant, whereas
the trisphenols like (HOC6H2Me2CH2)3N may bathochromically shift absorption bands.
The band at 225 nm for 12 is caused by hypercoordinated
Si atom, which is red shifted to 235 nm in 13 due to
conjugation.

It is evident that the bands at 270–290
nm with lower absorptivity
(0.40–1.40 × 104) for 9 and 11–13 are referred to the absorption of
the aromatic groups of the ligand frameworks (291 nm for 1(44) and 286 nm for 2(45)). The highly intensive band at 254 nm for 11 corresponds to the Si6 framework, and in this case, a weak
hypercoordination results in weak hypsochromic shift compared to the
all-methylated reference compound.46 Furthermore,
the effect of hypercoordination based on aminotrisphenols with terminal
modification17d is very weak.

Conclusions
In this work, the synthesis of a novel class of hypercoordinated
silicon derivatives, oligosilanylsilatrane-like molecules, based on
aminotrisphenols is presented. In contrast to previously investigated
cases, high reactivity and clean reaction of silatrane-like molecules
containing aromatic ligands and chloride as a leaving group were observed
with silanyl anions; that is why the precise choice of the starting
materials is very important. Single-crystal XRD analysis showed that
Si–N distances in catenated silatrane-like molecules with aromatic
ring vary within a wide range (2.23–2.72 Å), as the nature
of the ligand strongly affects the structural parameters. Apparently,
the introduction of oligosilanyl substituents to the central Si atom
in silatranes results in Si–N bond elongation irrespective
of the ligand type, which is in part explained by steric reasons,
mostly due to repulsions between voluminous Si(SiMe3)2R fragments and rigid silatranyl- or silatranyl-like groups;
the flexibility of the ligands’ “arms” (which
increases in the range of o-C6H4 < CH2CH2 < CH2-o-C6H2Me2) results in diminished
steric impact, and, therefore, the electronic nature of the substituents
gains more influence on the central Si geometry. NMR spectroscopy
of hypercoordinated derivatives also indicates that the 29Si chemical shift of SiO3 changes in wide limits (−45
to −117.1 ppm) depending on the ligand type. Furthermore, the
analysis of obtained and literature data for all groups of atranes
and related derivatives indicates that the axial substituent X at
the central X–SiO3 atom strongly affects the Si–N
distance. Thus, there are three main factors influencing the structure
and properties of silatranes and related compounds: nature of the
ligand (formation of chelate cycles and their flexibility), geometric
volumes of the substituents, and its electronic properties.

Experimental
Section
General Remarks
All reactions involving air-sensitive
compounds were carried out under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen or
argon using either Schlenk techniques or a glovebox. Solvents were
dried using a column solvent purification system.48 Potassium tert-butanolate was purchased
exclusively from Merck, thionyl chloride 99.5% from Acros, and silicon
tetrachloride 99% from Riedel-de Haën.

Chemical substances
used as starting materials like tris(2-methoxyphenyl)amine,12a tris(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethylbenzyl)amine (2),14a (Me3Si)3SiSiMe2SiMe2Cl,49 aminotris(-3′,5′-dimethylbenzyl-2′-oxy)silyl

potassium·THF (7),51 and
tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl potassium·18-crown-6 (8)51 were prepared according to literature
procedures.

1H (300 MHz), 13C (75.4 MHz),
and 29Si (59.3 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian
Unity INOVA 300
(1H 299.95 MHz, 13C 75.43 MHz, 29Si 59.59) MHz spectrometer. If not noted otherwise, for all samples
CDCl3 was the solvent used (the signal of residual CHCl3 has been used as a reference), or in the case of reaction
samples, they were measured with a D2O capillary to provide
an external lock frequency signal. 29Si NMR spectra were
either recorded using the INEPT pulse sequence52 (optimized for SiMe3 groups), which compensates
for the low isotopic abundance of 29Si, or using Varian
standard s2pul sequence to detect the silatrane silicon signal or
was used for the amplification of the signal. Elementary analysis
was carried using a Heraeus Vario Elementar EL apparatus. Mass spectra
were obtained with an Agilent 5975C coupled to an Agilent 7890A gas
chromatograph. Assignment of peaks was based on the most abandon isotopes.
Melting point determination was carried out using a melting point
apparatus with a microscope from Müller Optronic equipped with
a JM628 digital thermometer with a Pt-100 thermocouple. UV spectra
were measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 spectrometer using spectroscopy-grade
pentane as the solvent. Spectra plotting were done using Spectrograph
1.07.

X-ray Structure Determination
For X-ray structure analyses,
the crystals were mounted onto the tip of glass fibers, and data collection
was performed with BRUKER-AXS SMART APEX and SMART APEX II CCD diffractometers
using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (0.71073 Å).
The data were reduced to F02 and corrected for absorption effects with SAINT53 and SADABS54 separately. Structures
were solved by direct methods and refined by the full-matrix least-squares
method (SHELXL97 and SHELX2013).55 All
nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters.
Hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions to correspond to
standard bond lengths and angles and refined using a riding model.
Crystal 3 represented a pseudomerohedral twinning with
domain ratio 0.678(2)/0.322(2). All diagrams were drawn with 30% probability
thermal ellipsoids, and all hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity.

Synthesis of
Compounds
Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)amine
Modified procedure was used.12a To a three-necked flask equipped with a reflux
condenser, Dean-Stark trap, and stir bar were added o-anisidine (4.96 g, 40.27 mmol), o-iodoanisole (18.30
g, 78.19 mmol), powder of K2CO3 (23.50 g, 170.30
mmol), spongy copper powder (5.0 g), and nitrobenzene (15 mL). The
flask was then heated for 3 h at reflux with flashes of nitrogen to
remove the water from the reaction mixture and collected in Dean-Stark
trap. The reaction mixture was then cooled, and the product was extracted
with hot chloroform and filtered over filter paper. Chloroform was
removed by vacuum. Nitrobenzene was distilled of at 55 °C, 1
mbar. The residue was dissolved in ethylacetate and mixed with 100
mg of activated carbon and passed through a silica gel column. The
used ethylacetate was removed by vacuum. The residue was dissolved
in 10 mL of hot chloroform, and then, 5 mL of n-hexane
was added and left for crystallization. Colorless crystals of tris(2-methoxyphenyl)amine
(8.53 g, 65%) were obtained by filtering the solution mixture with
a frit filter. mp: 152–153 °C. NMR (δ in ppm): 1H: 7.05–7.01 (m, 3H, aryl), 6.87–6.78 (m, 9H,

(1.00
g, 2.98 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and AlCl3 (0.91 g, 6.82 mmol,
2.3 equiv) in toluene (5 mL) was refluxed for 90 min. After cooling
the mixture to rt, 10% HCl (20 mL) was added, stirred for 2 h, then
extracted with EtOAc, and dried over Na2SO4.
After the solvent was removed, 1.04 g of crude 1 was
obtained. It was dissolved in a mixture of diethylether and pentane
