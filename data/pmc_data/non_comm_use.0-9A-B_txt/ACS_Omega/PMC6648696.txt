The role of NH and OH groups in the
oxidative addition reactions
of the complexes [PtMe2(κ2-N,N′-L)], L = 2-C5H4NCH2NH-x-C6H4OH [3, x = 2, L = L1; 4, x = 3, L = L2; 5, x =
4, L = L3], has been investigated. Complex 3 is the most reactive. It reacts with CH2Cl2 to give a mixture of isomers of [PtMe2(CH2Cl)(κ3-N,N′,O-(L1-H)], 6,
and decomposes in acetone to give [PtMe3(κ3-N,N′,O-(L1-H)], 7, both of which contain the
fac tridentate deprotonated ligand. Complex 3 reacts
with MeI to give complex 7, whereas 4 and 5 react to give [PtIMe3(κ2-N,N′-L2))], 8, or [PtIMe3(κ2-N,N′-L3)], 9, respectively.
Each complex 3, 4, or 5 reacts
with either dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide to give the corresponding
complex [Pt(OH)2Me2(κ2-N,N′-L)], 10, L = L1; 11, L = L2; 12, L = L3. The ligand L3 in complexes 9 and 12 is easily oxidized to the corresponding imine ligand 2-C5H4NCH=N-4-C6H4OH, L4, in forming the complexes [PtIMe3(κ2-N,N′-L4)], 13, and [Pt(OH)2Me2(κ2-N,N′-L4)], 14, respectively. The NH and OH groups play a significant
role in supramolecular polymer or sheet structures of the complexes,
formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and these structures
indicate how either intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonding
may assist some oxidative addition reactions.

Introduction
There is great current
interest in cooperative catalysis, which
combines two or more forms of catalysis to enhance reactivity or selectivity
or to enable tandem catalysis.1 The combination
of transition-metal catalysis and acid catalysis is particularly effective.
For example, the oxidation of methane to methanol by platinum(II)
complexes occurs most readily in protic solvents.2 Oxygen is ideal as the oxidant for methanol production
from methane if a good catalyst system can be found.3 However, catalysts designed by chemists have not yet approached
the efficiency and selectivity of enzymic methane monooxygenase catalysts,
which are able to deliver, in the required order for catalysis, oxygen,
methane, electrons, and protons to the active site.4 For design of platinum complexes for methane oxidation,
one valuable approach is to study the reactivity and mechanism in
individual steps of a catalytic cycle, and the step requiring activation
of dioxygen has been the focus of several recent studies.2,3,5 Of particular interest is the
observation that activation of dioxygen can occur in the absence of
a protic solvent if the supporting ligand in a dimethylplatinum(II)
complex carries an alcohol or a phenol substituent and that the reactivity
is enhanced if the ligand also has a free pyridyl donor group (Scheme 1).5 The role of the phenol is to act as a proton donor to the
incipient peroxide group in the reaction of A to give B, while concurrent coordination of the pyridyl group supports
the electron transfer from the electron-rich dimethylplatinum(II)
center to dioxygen. The proposed hydroperoxide intermediate reacted
rapidly with a second equivalent of A to form two equivalents
of C, and C finally isomerized to form the
stable product D.5,6

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism
of Reaction of Complex A with Dioxygen
To Give Complex D
The organometallic chemistry of alkyl complexes with appended
hydroxyl
groups is limited because many metal–alkyl bonds undergo facile
protonolysis.7 However, alkylplatinum(II)
complexes contain relatively nonpolar metal–carbon bonds which
react only slowly with phenols, while alkylplatinum(IV) complexes
are completely inert. As a result, there is now an extensive supramolecular
chemistry of organoplatinum complexes with hydrogen bonds.8 These intermolecular hydrogen bonds might also
play an important role in catalysis or in stoichiometric bond activation.9 The application of NH functionality in organometallic
cooperative catalysis has also become important in catalyst design,
by molecular recognition through hydrogen bonding to give catalyst–substrate
or catalyst–catalyst interactions.10a Dimethylplatinum(II) complexes containing primary or secondary amine
donors have not been studied systematically. These complexes, such
as [PtMe2(H2NCH2CH2NH2)], are sometimes difficult to handle, and they react with
oxygen in air only if an extra donor atom is present.6,10b This paper reports the reactivity toward oxidative addition of dimethylplatinum(II)
complexes with ligands containing both O–H and N–H bond
functionality and the rich supramolecular chemistry of the resulting
organoplatinum(IV) complexes.

Results and Discussion
The aminopyridine
ligands L1–L3, which contain
phenol substituents at the amine donor, and their dimethylplatinum(II)
complexes, which have been reported earlier, are shown in Scheme 2.11,12 The complexes [PtMe2(L)], 3–5, are difficult to isolate from the equilibrium
mixture formed by reaction between [Pt2Me4(μ-SMe2)2], 1,13 and the ligands L1–L3 (Scheme 2), and subsequent reactions were carried
out from the complexes formed in situ.12

Scheme 2 Ligands Used in This Work and the Dimethylplatinum(II) Complexes 3–5
Oxidative Addition Chemistry of Complexes 3–5
Complexes 4 and 5 were stable
in solutions in acetone, but complex 3 was less stable
(see below). Complex 3 also reacted with solvent dichloromethane
by oxidative addition and loss of HCl to give the isomeric complexes 6a and 6b in about 5:4 ratio (Scheme 3). Because of the absence of
symmetry, the 1H NMR spectrum of each isomer contained
two methylplatinum resonances at δ = 0.76, 2J(PtH) = 71 Hz, and 0.96, 2J(PtH) = 69 Hz, for 6a and 1.03, 2J(PtH) = 70 Hz, and 1.09, 2J(PtH) = 71 Hz, for 6b, in the range expected for platinum(IV)
complexes. The CH2N group for each isomer gave two resonances
at δ 4.66 and 5.39 (6a) and at 4.64 and 4.82 (6b). Similarly, each PtCH2Cl group gave two resonances
at δ 3.86, 2J(PtH) = 75 Hz, and
4.32, 2J(PtH) = 88 Hz, for 6a and 3.74, 2J(PtH) = 33 Hz, and 3.84, 2J(PtH) = 20 Hz, for 6b.14a The NMR data do not define the stereochemistry,
but crystallization gave the complex [PtMe2(CH2Cl)(κ3-N,N′,O-L1-H)] in which 6a and 6b were present in about 70:30 disordered occupancy (Figure 1). The structure
determination reveals that the deprotonated ligand is present in the
fac tridentate bonding mode, with the other three sites at the octahedral
platinum(IV) center occupied by two methyl groups and a chloromethyl
group. In 6a and 6b, the chloromethyl group
is trans to pyridyl nitrogen and oxygen, respectively, and in each
case, there is a hydrogen bond interaction NH···Cl,
with the distance N···Cl = 3.23(1) Å in 6a. A third isomer is possible in which the chloromethyl group
is trans to the amine nitrogen, but this was not observed, perhaps
because no intramolecular NH···Cl hydrogen bond would
be possible. The mechanism of the reaction with dichloromethane was
not determined, but precedents usually invoke free-radical intermediates.14b−14d

Scheme 3 Formation of Complexes 6a and 6b by Reaction
of 3 with Dichloromethane
The reactivity to oxidative addition was first tested
by reaction
of complexes 3–5 with methyl iodide (Scheme 4).15 Complex 3 reacted with loss of HI and coordination
of the phenoxide group to give fac-[PtMe3{κ3-N,N′,O-(L1-H)}], 7, whereas 4 and 5 reacted by simple oxidative addition to give fac-[PtIMe3(κ2-N,N′-L2)], 8, and fac-[PtMe3I(κ2-N,N′-L3)], 9, respectively.
Complex 7 has no symmetry, so it gave three methylplatinum
resonances at δ 0.58, 2J(PtH) =
74 Hz, at δ 0.81, 2J(PtH) = 82 Hz,
and at δ 1.02, 2J(PtH) = 69 Hz in
the 1H NMR spectrum and at δ −6.8, −11.4
and −16.8 in the 13C NMR spectrum. The CH2 resonances of 7 were observed in the 1H
NMR spectrum at δ = 4.61 and 4.76 as CHaCHb doublets with coupling constant 2J(HH)
16 Hz, and in the 13C NMR spectrum by a singlet at δ
62.9. Complex 7 crystallized as a hydrate 7·H2O and its molecular structure is shown in Figure 2. It confirms that
the ligand L1 is deprotonated and coordinated in the fac-κ3-N,N′,O bonding mode, as observed for complex 6 (Figure 1). The water molecule
[O atom is O(1S) in Figure 2] takes part in intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Scheme 4 Reactions with Methyl
Iodide
The complexes 8 and 9 exist in solution
as a mixture of two isomers, arising from the chirality at the amine
nitrogen (Scheme 4).
For example, in the 1H NMR spectrum of 9,
there were three methylplatinum resonances at δ 0.57, 2J(PtH) = 73 Hz, 0.95, 2J(PtH) = 71 Hz, and 1.39, 2J(PtH) = 73
Hz, for the major isomer and three methylplatinum resonances at δ
0.80, 2J(PtH) = 71 Hz, 0.94, 2J(PtH) = 73 Hz, and 1.40, 2J(PtH) = 72 Hz, for the minor isomer. The complexes crystallized as
the isomers 8a and 9a, with the N–H
and Pt–I groups mutually syn, and the structures are shown
in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

Under an inert atmosphere, complex 3, which
was present
as an equilibrium mixture with [PtMe2(SMe2)2], 2, free L1, and Me2S (Scheme 2), decomposed
slowly in acetone or acetonitrile to give a mixture of mainly two
products, which were not easily separated. One of these products was
identified as complex 7, which could be crystallized
from the solution as either 7·H2O [the
same product as obtained from 3 with methyl iodide (Figure 2)] or as a cocrystal
with the ligand, 7·L1. However, the
other product could not be crystallized and the structure was not
defined by the NMR spectra. In acetone-d6, it gave a single methylplatinum resonance at δ 1.43, 2J(PtH) = 74 Hz, suggesting that the decomposition
involves a disproportionation to give a mixture of PtMe3 and PtMe complexes, for which there are several precedents.16

Each of the complexes 3–5 in acetone solution
reacted with hydrogen peroxide or with dioxygen to give the corresponding trans-dihydroxoplatinum(IV) complexes 10–12 (Scheme 5) as colorless
precipitates. The 1H NMR spectrum of each complex contained
two methylplatinum resonances. For example, complex 10 gave methylplatinum resonances at δ 1.13, 2J(PtH) = 71 Hz, and 1.62, 2J(PtH) = 73 Hz, in the range expected for platinum(IV) complexes.
Structure determinations were carried out for each complex as 10, 11·H2O, and 12·MeOH, and the molecular structures are shown in Figures 5–67, respectively. In each case, the platinum
center has octahedral stereochemistry and the two oxygen donors are
mutually trans. The complexes are drawn in Scheme 5 as dihydroxo complexes with an appended
phenol group, but, given the greater acidity of a phenol compared
to a PtOH group, they might be more accurately represented as containing trans-[Pt(OH)(OH2)]+ groups with an
appended phenolate group (Chart 1). Under similar conditions, dimethylplatinum(II) complexes
such as [PtMe2(2,2′-bipyridine)], which do not contain
NH or OH functional groups, react similarly with hydrogen peroxide
but not with dioxygen.17 A hydroxylic solvent
or a higher concentration of water is needed to enable the reaction
of [PtMe2(2,2′-bipyridine)] with oxygen to occur,
so the NH or OH group clearly plays a role in the reactions to give
complexes 10–12 (Scheme 5).6,17 Complex 3 is the only precursor that is designed to form an intramolecular
hydrogen bond to the forming peroxide group in an analogue of B (Scheme 1), so an intermolecular stabilization is probable in the reactions
of 4 and 5 with dioxygen.

Chart 1 Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond in Complex 10 and
Formulation
as Pt(OH)2···Phenol, 10a, or
[Pt (OH)(OH2)]+···Phenolate, 10b
In the structure of
complex 10, there are two independent
molecules, which have opposite chirality at both the amine nitrogen
and platinum centers (Figure 5). The hydrogen atoms were not directly located, so their
placement in a complex hydrogen-bonded assembly is uncertain. There
is a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond in both independent molecules,
with O(2)···O(3) 2.49(1) and O(5)···O(6)
2.48(1) Å, and there are also weaker intermolecular hydrogen
bonds (see later). The molecular structures of 11 and 12 are similar to that of 10 except that they
lack the intramolecular hydrogen bond and instead have a hydrogen-bonded
solvate molecule (H2O in 11, Figure 6, MeOH in 12, Figure 7).

Complexes of
Ligand L4
Two complexes of
the imine ligand L4 were initially prepared unexpectedly
by oxidation of the amine ligand L3 (Scheme 6). The complex [PtIMe3(L4)], 13, was formed by reaction of complex 9 with Ag2O in an attempt to abstract the iodide
ligand and deprotonate the phenol to form an oligomer or polymer [PtMe3(L3-H)}n]. Instead,
the silver oxide evidently oxidized the ligand L3. The
complex [Pt(OH)2Me2(L4)], 14, was prepared during an attempt to recrystallize complex 12 in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, with oxidation of
the ligand L3 by H2O2. The complexes 13 and 14 were then prepared independently by
the oxidative addition of MeI or H2O2, respectively,
to the platinum(II) complex [PtMe2(L4)], 15, which was prepared in situ by reaction of [Pt2Me4(μ-SMe2)2], 1, with the ligand L4. No oxidation of the ligands L1 or L2 was observed in similar reactions of
complexes 3 or 4 with methyl iodide or hydrogen
peroxide. In contrast to the complex 5, containing amine
ligand L3, complex 15 did not react easily
with dioxygen, indicating that the NH group in 5 plays
a role in the oxygen activation step (Scheme 5). The 1H NMR spectrum of 13 in CD3OD showed three methylplatinum resonances
as expected at δ 1.46, 1.18, and 0.63 with values of 2J(PtH) in the range 72–73 Hz, and the resonance
of the characteristic imine proton resonance at δ 9.02 with 3J(PtH) = 27 Hz. The imine resonance for 14 appeared at δ 9.15, 3J(PtH) = 16 Hz.

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Complexes 13 and 14, Containing
Ligand L4. Reagents: (i) Ag2O and (ii) H2O2
The structure of complex 13 is shown in Figure 8. The main difference
from
complex 9 (Figure 4) is the orientation of the phenol substituent and near planarity
at the imine nitrogen atom N(2) of the ligand L4. There
is an intermolecular OH···I hydrogen bonding interaction
with distance O(1)···I(1A) 3.47(1) Å, which forms
a racemic dimer with molecules related by an inversion center. The
orientation of the ligand L4 in complex 14 is similar, as shown in Figure 9, and the hydroxo ligands are mutually trans, as in
the complexes 10–12 (Figures 5–67).

Supramolecular Structures of the Platinum(IV) Complexes
All of the complexes described above form hydrogen bonds. Complex 6 (Figure 1) contains only an intramolecular hydrogen bond, and complex 13 (Figure 8) forms only a head-to-tail dimer through intermolecular hydrogen
bonding. However, the other platinum(IV) complexes form more complex
supramolecular structures, ranging from 1D polymers to 2D sheets and
these are discussed below.

The supramolecular structure of complex 7 as the 1:1 compound 7·L1 is
shown in Figure 10. There are two independent molecules with platinum atoms Pt(1) and
Pt(2). Each forms a supramolecular polymer by self-recognition between
neighbors. For example, in the Pt(1) chain, each L1 molecule
bridges between two Pt(1) molecules, having the same chirality, through
PtO···HO and PtNH···N(py) hydrogen bonds
with O(1)···O(2) 2.56 Å and N(2)···N(3)
3.03 Å. Each polymer chain is therefore isotactic. The lattice
symmetry includes an inversion center, so there are equal numbers
of polymer chains with C and A chirality
of individual platinum centers. The NH groups of the free ligand molecules L1 do not take part in hydrogen bonding.

polymeric structure of complex 7·L1. Symmetry-related atoms in neighboring molecules:
Pt(1) chain: x, y, z; 1–x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 – z; 1 – x, −1/2 + y, 1/2 – z; Pt(2) chain: x, y, z; −x, 1/2 + y, 1/2 – z; −x, −1/2 + y, 1/2
– z.

In contrast, the complex 7·H2O forms
a hydrogen-bonded sheet structure illustrated in Figure 11. Each water molecule bridges
between three molecules of 7 acting as the hydrogen bond
donor to two, with O(1S)···O(1) 2.86 Å and O(1S)···O(1A)
2.90 Å, and acceptor to one, with O(1S)···N(2B)
2.94 Å. Propagation of this motif gives a racemic sheet structure.

1 – y, 1 – z; B,
3/2 – x, −1/2 + y,

Complex 8 forms a more complex sheet structure
shown
in Figure 12. Syndiotactic
polymer chains are formed by intermolecular OH···I
hydrogen bonding [O(1)···I(1B) = O(1A)···I(1)
= 3.55 Å], with self-discrimination (Figure 12a). A weaker intermolecular NH···I
hydrogen bonding [N(2)···I(1B) = N(2A)···I(1)
= 3.76 Å] gives isotactic polymer chains by self-recognition
(Figure 12b). The
combination of these two effects gives a corrugated sheet structure,
in which parallel chains of the OH···I bonded polymers
(shown end-on in Figure 12c) can be considered to be cross-linked by the interchain
NH···I hydrogen bonds (Figure 12c).

Figure 12 Supramolecular corrugated sheet structure
of complex 8, showing (a) the OH···I links,
(b) the NH···I
links, and (c) a side view of the resulting sheet structure.

Complex 9 also forms
a sheet structure but with a
significant difference (Figure 13). In this case, isotactic polymer chains are formed
by intermolecular OH···I hydrogen bonding [O(1)···I(1B)
= O(1A)···I(1) = 3.51 Å], with self-recognition
(Figure 13). A weaker
intermolecular NH···I hydrogen bonding [N(2)···I(1B)
= N(2A)···I(1) = 3.77 Å] also gives isotactic
polymer chains by self-recognition. The combination of these two effects
gives a sheet structure, in a similar way as for complex 8, with the major difference that the sheets for 9 are
chiral, with all platinum and nitrogen centers having the same chirality.
The space group for 9 is P212121, which is common when resolution of enantiomers
by direct crystallization is successful, including the classic case
of Pasteur’s sodium ammonium tartrate.18

Complex 10 forms
supramolecular polymeric chains by
a combination of intermolecular OH···O and NH···O
hydrogen bonding (Figure 14), with O(1)O(5A) 2.68 Å, N(2)O(5A) 2.92 Å, O(2)O(4)
2.68 Å, and O(2)N(4) 2.88 Å. The independent Pt(1) and Pt(2)
centers (Figure 5)
have opposite chirality but all equivalent atoms in each chain have
the same chirality. The space group contains an inversion center,
so there are equal numbers of chains in which the Pt(1)Pt(2)Pt(1)Pt(2)
sequences have CACA and ACAC chirality.

Complex 11·H2O forms a supramolecular
sheet structure (Figure 15). The strongest hydrogen bonds involve the phenol (phenolate)
groups which form head-to-tail dimer units (Figure 15b), with O(2)···O(3A) 2.60
Å. On the opposite side, there are head-to-tail dimers formed
by NH···O hydrogen bonds (Figure 15a) with O(1)···N(2A) 2.87
Å. Individual molecules in each of these dimer units is related
by an inversion center, and the combined effect is to form syndiotactic
polymer chains by self-discrimination. The third hydrogen bonding
interaction involves the solvent water molecules (Figure 15c, O(1)···O(1S)
2.76 Å, O(1)···O1(SA) 2.98 Å), which can
be considered to cross-link the polymer chains to form the final sheet
structure.

= O(3)···O(2B) = 2.57 Å and this gives an isotactic
polymeric unit (Figure 16a). These polymers are cross-linked to polymers of opposite
chirality by multiple weaker hydrogen bonds involving bridging phenol(phenoxide)
[O(3)···O(1B) 2.94 Å] and bridging methanol solvate
molecules [O(1)···O(1S) 2.62 Å, O(1S)···N(2C)
2.89 Å] to give a complex racemic sheet structure (Figure 16b).

The absence of an NH proton leads
to a simpler supramolecular polymeric
structure for complex 14·2MeOH (Figure 17). Individual molecules in
each chain lie on a twofold screw axis. They are connected through
bridging phenol(phenoxide) groups [O(1)···O(3A) = O(3)···O(1B)
= 2.51 Å, O(2)···O(3B) = O(3)···O(2A)
= 2.96 Å] and methanol solvate molecules [O(1)···O(1S)
= 2.86 Å, O(2)···O(1SC) = 2.62 Å]. The second
methanol solvate is hydrogen-bonded only to O(2), with O(2)···O(2SC)
= 2.76 Å.

Conclusions
The research was intended to discover how
the presence of phenol
OH and amine NH groups influence oxidative addition to dimethylplatinum(II)
complexes, as a model for key steps in potential cooperative catalysis.
Only the ligand L1 has the phenol OH group in a position
to play a strong intramolecular role in supporting oxidative addition.
It is interesting to note that the phenol group in [PtMe2(L1)] could provide anchimeric assistance as a donor
or acceptor group. When the phenol is deprotonated with phenolate
coordination during oxidative addition, the donor effect is more likely,
and when coordination of phenolate does not occur, the acceptor role
is more likely. These cases are represented by oxidative addition
with methyl iodide (Scheme 4) or hydrogen peroxide and O2/H2O (Scheme 5) respectively, as
illustrated by proposed mechanisms in Scheme 7. With methyl iodide, phenol coordination
accompanies the oxidative addition (a new PtMe bond is formed on the
face remote from the phenol) to give the cationic intermediate E and then product 7. In contrast, we suggest
that hydrogen peroxide or dioxygen attacks at the face adjacent to
the phenol substituent and in the case of H2O2 (Scheme 7) serves
to stabilize the leaving hydroxide group.

Scheme 7 Possible Roles of
2-Phenol Group in 3 as Electron Donor
in Reaction with Methyl Iodide or Acceptor in Reaction with Hydrogen
Peroxide
Each of the dimethylplatinum(II)
complexes 3, 4, and 5 react
with dioxygen, though only complex 3 contains the 2-phenol
unit needed to form an intermediate
analogous to B (Scheme 1). It is likely that the reactions of 4 and 5 with dioxygen are instead aided by intermolecular
hydrogen bonding to the forming peroxide group. It is possible that
the NH group could also assist with the dioxygen activation through
hydrogen bonding, but there is no direct evidence for this. Both the
phenol OH and amine NH groups are important in the supramolecular
chemistry of the complexes. The phenol groups form the shorter hydrogen
bond distances and so probably have a dominant role in forming the
preferred supramolecular structures. It is likely that the role in
the oxidative addition reactions is also stronger for the phenol OH
groups. Thus, the supramolecular structures observed for the platinum(IV)
products can be considered to give a clue to the role of the NH and
OH groups in the bond activation steps. For example, in the platinum(IV)
complexes [Pt(OH)2Me2(L)], the
phenol groups are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding when L = L1 (Figures 5 and 14) but in intermolecular
hydrogen bonding when L = L2, L3, or L4 (Figures 15–1617), and the same intramolecular versus intermolecular hydrogen
bonding is proposed for the activation of dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide
in forming these platinum(IV) products from complex 3 or 4, 5, and 15, respectively.
Studies of both bond activation steps and supramolecular structures
can provide insight into the ways that cooperative catalysis using
electron-rich transition-metal complexes in combination with NH or
OH functional groups might function.1−4

Experimental Section
NMR spectra
were recorded using Bruker 400 NMR, Inova 400, and
Inova 600 spectrometers. The NMR labeling is shown in Chart 2. The complex [Pt2Me4(μ-SMe2)2], dimethylplatinum(II)
complexes 3–5, and ligands L1–L4 were synthesized according to literature procedures.12,13,19,20

Structure Determinations21
Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction measurements were made using a Bruker
APEX-II charge coupled device diffractometer with graphite-monochromated
Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. Single crystals
of the complexes were immersed in paraffin oil and mounted on MiTeGen
MicroMounts. The structures were solved using direct methods and refined
by the full-matrix least-squares procedure of SHELXTL. The hydrogen
atoms were introduced at idealized positions and were allowed to refine
isotropically. Full crystallographic data are given in the CIF files
(CCDC 1844768–1844777).

Many of the structures contain
Pt–OH, C6H4OH, H2O, and MeOH
groups, with extensive hydrogen bonding. The H-atom positions were
usually determined by short H-bond distances, but in other cases,
the positions are tentative. For complex 8, there was
evidence for a small degree of disorder between the mutually trans
methyl and iodo groups, which led to anomalous electron density around
the methyl atoms and a long Pt–Me distance. Attempts to model
the disorder were unsuccessful and some restraints were used to mitigate
the problem.

a The observation
of very different values of the geminal coupling constants 2J(PtH)
in 6a and 6b is noteworthy. Geminal coupling constants can be positive
or negative and magnitudes vary widely, but it is unusual to see such
different values in compounds with the same substituents.
