We have developed novel surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) sensor
chips whose surfaces bear newly synthesized functional self-assembled
monolayer (SAM) anchoring lignin through covalent chemical bonds.
The SPR sensor chips are remarkably robust and suitable for repetitive
and accurate measurement of noncovalent lignin–peptide interactions,
which is of significant interest in the chemical or biochemical conversion
of renewable woody biomass to valuable chemical feedstocks. The lignin-anchored
SAMs were prepared for the first time by click chemistry based on
an azide–alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition: mixed SAMs are fabricated
on gold thin film using a mixture of alkynyl and methyl thioalkyloligo(ethylene
oxide) disulfides and then reacted with azidated milled wood lignins
to furnish the functional SAMs anchoring lignins covalently. The resulting
SAMs were characterized using infrared reflection–absorption,
Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies to confirm covalent
immobilization of the lignins to the SAMs via triazole linkages and
also to reveal that the SAM formation induces a helical conformation
of the ethylene oxide chains. Further, SPR measurements of the noncovalent
lignin–peptide interactions using lignin-binding peptides have
demonstrated high reproducibility and durability of the prepared lignin-anchored
sensor chips.

1 Introduction
Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) is one of the most powerful analytical
methods to evaluate interactions of various compounds with biopolymers,
such as proteins, peptides, (oligo)sugars, and DNAs.1−5 The biopolymers are conventionally loaded onto the surface of the
sensor chips by physical adsorption through dip or spin coating, often
resulting in a significant error and poor reproducibility due to the
detachment of the biopolymers.1 Immobilization
of biopolymers on the sensor chip surface via covalent chemical bonds
can solve this problem and produce highly robust SPR sensor chips
with sufficient durability and reproducibility.1−5 A mixed self-assembled monolayer (SAM) has been adopted
for this purpose because the number or concentration of immobilized
molecules is easily controlled to achieve high surface density and
to suppress their self-aggregation, simultaneously.6,7 Thus,
the mixed SAMs with covalent immobilization of structurally well-defined
proteins, peptides, (oligo)sugars, and DNAs have been well established.8−12 However, mixed SAMs bearing structurally undefined biopolymers,
such as lignin,13,14 humic acid,15 and fulvic acid,16 of significant
botanical and ecological importance, have remained virtually unexamined
due to the lack of the appropriate method of anchoring such class
of biopolymers. We report herein development of novel SPR chips whose
surfaces bear newly synthesized functional SAM covalently anchoring
lignin. The SPR sensor chips showed remarkable durability for accurate
and repetitive measurement of noncovalent lignin–peptide interactions.

Lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses are primary components of
lignocellulosic biomass and have gained considerable attention for
their efficient and practical use as a renewable energy source and
sustainable chemical feedstock.13,14 In particular, enzymatic
conversion of cellulose and hemicelluloses to ethanol has been recognized
as a crucial technology to produce liquid fuels (bioethanol) free
from the excessive use of fossil resources.17 On the other hand, the coexistence of lignin with cellulose and
hemicelluloses is known to limit this conversion process severely
by adsorbing or trapping the cellulase enzymes.17−19 Considerable
efforts have thus far been paid to study the interactions of lignin
with proteins or peptides by highly sensitive SPR20,21 and quartz crystal microbalance22−24 sensor techniques in
addition to conventional less sensitive methods, such as enzymatic
reactions,25−27 adsorption isotherms,28−30 and potentiometric titrations.31 However, lignins have usually been attached
to sensor chips via physical adsorption;32 consequently, undesired detachment of lignin from the sensor chip
surface has impeded accurate analysis.

We therefore have engaged
in the fabrication of covalently lignin-anchored
SPR sensor chips through a SAM interface. Covalent immobilization
of milled wood lignins (MWLs) was achieved by Huisgen cycloaddition-based
click chemistry8,9,33,34 between an azide-functionalized MWL (N3-MWL) and a mixed SAM composed of alkynyl- and methoxy-terminated
oligo(ethylene oxide) thiolates (mixed-SAM, Scheme 1). A dense SAM and hydrophilic interface
was thus formed by the hexyl and tri(ethylene oxide) units. The dissociation
constant of the recently discovered 12-residual lignin-binding peptide
(i.e., C416) to the immobilized MWL was measured accurately with notable
robustness and reproducibility.20 In addition,
spectroscopic investigation by means of infrared reflection–absorption
(IR RA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) elucidates that
the fabricated SAMs adopt a helical conformation of the ethylene oxide
(EO) chains, resulting in dense packing of the SAM molecules and contributing
to their observed high accuracy.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Methoxy- and
Alkynyl-Terminated
Disulfides
The click immobilization of the biomolecules was
mostly achieved using mixed SAMs formed by mixing azide-terminated
alkanethiols (N3(EO)4–7(CH2)11–12SH) and oligo(ethylene oxide)-terminated
alkanethiols (HO(EO)3–4(CH2)11SH) via the methods established by Whitesides35 using various molar ratios. Note that few reports on mixed
SAMs with alkyne-terminated alkanethiolates are available, even though
azide groups are ideal for biomolecule functionalization because of
their higher tolerance than alkynyl groups in diverse reaction conditions.36−38 Recently, methyl-terminated thioalkyloligo(ethylene oxide) (MeO(EO)n(CH2)mSH) SAM was found to possess high resistivity to nonspecific protein
adsorption in a manner similar to SAMs with oligo(ethylene oxide)-terminated
thiolates.39 Further, terminal methoxy
groups, which are chemically more inert than hydroxy groups, make
methyl-terminated oligo(ethylene oxide) thiolates better SAM interfaces
for biosensor applications.

Two types of disulfides (i.e., methoxy-terminated
disulfide 4 and alkynyl-terminated disulfide 10) were synthesized to fabricate the mixed-SAM. Disulfide 4 was prepared from triethylene glycol methyl ether (1) by a three-step reaction involving alkylation, thioesterification,
followed by deprotection with concomitant oxidation to form the disulfide
(Scheme 2). Alkynyl-terminated
disulfide 10 was prepared via an essentially similar
route (Scheme 3). Initially,
selective monoprotection of pentaethylene glycol (5)
was performed using a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS)
group. The obtained protected glycol 6 was then converted
to S-thioacetate 8 by a similar synthetic
protocol shown in Scheme 2. The TBS and acetyl protecting groups were sequentially deprotected
to give hydroxy-terminated disulfide 9. Finally, the
hydroxy groups were alkynylated by the reaction of propargyl bromide
to give the desired alkynyl-terminated disulfide 10.

h, 80%; (c) 3 (3.1 mmol), NaOH (5.0 equiv), H2O–tetrahydrofuran (1:1, 31 mL), rt, 12 h, 97%.

mL), rt, 1 h, then 1-bromopropyne (3.0 equiv), rt, 12 h, 52%.

2.2 Fabrication of Alkyne-Terminated
Mixed Thiolate
SAMs
The alkyne-terminated mixed thiolate SAM (mixed-SAM)
was prepared by immersing a gold thin-film-coated quartz substrate
into a mixture of 4 and 10 with a molar
ratio of 3:1 in EtOH and left to stand at rt for 12 h (Scheme 4). Additionally, SAMs of 4 and 10 (i.e., MeO-SAM and alkyne-SAM, respectively)
were also prepared as reference samples using the same method. An
amino acid-tethered SAM (AA-SAM) was prepared from mixed-SAM by click
chemistry as described below. The self-assembled structure and terminal
functional groups of the SAMs were analyzed by means of infrared reflection-absorption
(IR RA) and Raman spectroscopic measurements. Stacked IR RA spectra
of MeO-SAM, alkyne-SAM, mixed-SAM, and AA-SAM are shown in Figure 1a–c. Figure 1a shows the entire
spectral range (900–4000 cm–1), in which
characteristic bands of the C–O stretching (νCO) and
C–H stretching (νCH) vibration modes are observed at
approximately 1130 and 2900 cm–1, respectively,
as discussed later in detail.

(blue line),
mixed-SAM (red line), and AA-SAM (green line). Magnified spectra of
(b) fingerprint and (c) C–H stretching regions. (d) Raman spectra
of alkyne-SAM (blue line) and mixed-SAM (red line).

Scheme 4 Fabrication of SAM Substrates
Magnified spectra of the νCO region at 900–1400
cm–1 (Figure 1b) show a characteristic strong band with two peaks at 1146
and 1120 cm–1, which, on account of similarity to
the previously reported IR spectrum of the MeO(CH2CH2O)3(CH2)3SH (MeO(EO)3C3SH) SAM,40−44 are assigned to the νCO mode of the tri(ethylene oxide) (EO)3 chain with a less-ordered conformation. The minute peak at
1201 cm–1 is assigned to the methyl group. It is
noteworthy that the νCO band becomes stronger as the structure
is changed, that is, the wavenumber component at 1130 cm–1 changes considerably in alkyne-SAM and mixed-SAM. Vanderah et al.
investigated the (EO)n chain length dependence
in the IR spectra of MeO-terminated SAM (MeO(EO)nC3SH), and similar intensity changes of the νCO
band were observed in the spectra of SAMs with n >
3 due to the cooperative formation of an energetically stable helical
structure.40,42,43 For this reason, we consider that helical structures are also formed
in alkyne-SAM and mixed-SAM. Indeed, the spectral bands at 1242 cm–1 of the CH2 twisting vibrational mode and
1349 cm–1 of the CH2 wagging vibration
mode are characteristic of helical structures. The observed formation
of a methoxy-terminated (EO)3 thiolate helical structure
is substantially induced by the introduction of a small amount of
alkyne-terminated (EO)5 thiolate, since the intensity of
the characteristic bands at 1349 and 1242 cm–1 of
alkyne-SAM and mixed-SAM is almost identical, even though the molar
ratio of 4 and 10 was 3:1. The creation
of such helical structures indicates the formation of dense SAMs amenable
for SPR applications.

Figure 1c shows
magnified spectra of the νCH region of the SAM methylene groups
(2930–2850 cm–1). Although the bands derived
from the alkyl chain (CH2)6 and (EO)3 are largely overlapped, similar band shapes were reported previously
to be generated from such moieties.40,42,43 Note that the weak peaks at 2981 and 2817 cm–1 are assigned to the CH3 asymmetric (νaCH3) and symmetric (νsCH3) stretching vibration bands of the terminal methyl group. Raman
spectra of both alkyne-SAM and mixed-SAM showed a characteristic band
of the C≡C stretching vibration (νC≡C) mode at
2328 cm–1, as depicted in Figure 1d. In addition, in the spectrum of alkyne-SAM
(blue, Figure 1a),
the obvious νCH band of the alkynyl C–H bond newly appears
at 3450 cm–1, whereas the three peaks resulting
from the methyl group disappear. Overall, these spectral features
clearly indicate the formation of mixed-SAM. It should also be noted
that the alkynyl νCH band at 3450 cm–1 of
mixed-SAM is broadened compared with the spectrum of alkyne-SAM, suggesting
that the alkynyl C–H bond interacts with an oxygen atom of
EO in a neighboring molecule(s).45

As described above, AA-SAM was prepared by click chemistry via
a copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition reaction.8,9 Immersing
the mixed-SAM into a solution of the azide-functionalized protected
amino acid Boc-l-Ala(N3)-OMe 11 and
shaking the flask at rt afforded AA-SAM. The IR RA spectra of the
obtained SAMs are indicated by the green lines in Figure 1a–c. The newly appeared
C=O stretching at 1749 cm–1 and the disappearance
of the terminal alkynyl νCH band around 3250 cm–1 clearly demonstrate formation of the desired AA-SAM product (Figure 1a, subtraction spectrum
in Figure S1). In addition, the N3 stretching at 2102 cm–1 observed in the starting
compound 11 disappeared in AA-SAM, with almost complete
consumption of the azide group. The similarity of the AA-SAM and MeO-SAM
spectra indicates that the EO helical structure in mixed-SAM unfolds
following the introduction of the amino acid.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were also performed
to confirm the formation of the triazole linkage resulting from the
click reaction of mixed-SAM with 11 (Figure 2). In accordance with the IR
RA analysis, the XPS spectrum of AA-SAM shows the incorporation of
nitrogen, as evidenced by the broadened N 1s peak at 400.1 eV with
a very weak azide peak at 404 eV (Figure 2c).46 The observed
broad N 1s peak can be assigned to the carbamate group and the triazole
ring.47−49 The XPS spectrum in the C 1s region exhibits two
peaks arising from C–C and C–O bonds at 284.5 and 285.8
eV, respectively, together with the O 1s and S 2p3/2 peaks
at 532.4 and 161.7 eV, respectively, which reflect the oxygen and
sulfur contents of the SAM layer (Figure 2b,d,e). These results indicate formation
of the triazole linkage in AA-SAM and further suggest the applicability
of mixed-SAM for the covalent immobilization of lignin via click chemistry.

2.3 Synthesis and Reactivity of Azide-Functionalized
MWLs
To apply the click reactions8,9 to
the covalent immobilization of lignin, azide functional groups were
introduced to MWLs32 derived both from
a softwood, Japanese cedar, Cryptomeria japonica (CMWL), and a hardwood, Eucalyptus globulus (EMWL). Softwood lignin is known to be mostly composed of guaiacyl
phenylpropanoid (G) units, whereas hardwood lignin principally consists
of G and syringyl phenylpropanoid (S) units.50,51 Although lignins have structural diversity based on the type and
area of the source woods, analytical efforts using NMR spectroscopy
revealed a substantial content of aliphatic hydroxy groups in various
types of lignins (1.0–6.0 mmol/g).52−56 In the present study, azide groups readily replaced
the aliphatic hydroxy groups by a mesylation reaction using methanesulfonyl
chloride followed by an SN2 reaction with sodium azide
to give the desired azide-functionalized MWLs (N3-CMWL
and N3-EMWL, Scheme 5). Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR ATR) measurements
confirmed the introduction of the azide groups by the appearance of
N3 stretching vibration bands at 2102 and 2104 cm–1 for N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL, respectively, together
with a diminishing O–H stretching vibration band observed around
3500 cm–1 (Figure 3, black and red lines) and negligible spectral changes
in the MWLs themselves.

Huisgen reaction with 12 (blue lines), and the Staudinger
reaction with PPh3 (green lines).

Scheme 5 Synthesis and Further Transformation of Azide-Functionalized
MWLs
The reactivity of the incorporated
azide groups was examined by
the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction8,9 and the Staudinger
reaction57,58 (Scheme 5). The copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition reaction
of N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL with Boc-l-propargyl-Gly-OH 12 proceeded to give amino acid-linked MWLs through triazole
rings (AA-CMWL and AA-EMWL). The IR ATR spectra of the obtained AA-CMWL
and AA-EMWL show almost complete disappearance of the characteristic
azide band at 2100 cm–1, together with strong C=O
stretching at 1710 and 1712 cm–1 and broad O–H/N–H
stretchings at 3356 and 3358 cm–1 for AA-CMWL and
AA-EMWL, respectively (Figure 3, blue lines). The reactivity of the azide groups of N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL was assessed by the Staudinger
reaction with triphenylphosphine in the presence of water. The IR
ATR spectra of the reaction products show complete disappearance of
azide stretching around 2100 cm–1 and broad N–H
stretching at 3332 and 3324 cm–1 for N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL, respectively, which is indicative of
the hydrolytic conversion of azide (−N3) to amine
(−NH2) (Figure 3, green lines). Overall, these results support the
introduction of azide groups to MWLs, suggesting that the obtained
N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL possess suitable reactivity
for the click immobilization of the MWLs onto the SAMs.

2.4 Click Immobilization of Azide-Functionalized
MWLs to SAM
The azide-functionalized MWLs N3-CMWL
and N3-EMWL were covalently immobilized onto the alkynyl-terminated
mixed-SAM substrate by click reactions (Scheme 1). Efficient click reactions of N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL to the mixed-SAM substrate were achieved
by simply shaking the reaction solution. After click immobilization,
unbound MWLs were washed away from the substrate by sonication in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 3 min. Observation of the CMWL-anchored
SAM CMWL–SAM by optical microscopy showed many bright spots
corresponding to the covalently immobilized MWL particles (Figure 4a). In contrast,
the reference sample prepared without treatment with click reaction
reagents, such as CuSO4·5H2O and ascorbic
acid, showed negligible bright spots because of irreversible adsorption
of N3-CMWL to the SAM surface (Figure 4b). Interestingly, before sonication in DMSO,
a much larger amount of adsorbed MWLs was observed for the reference
sample than that of the click-immobilized sample, though almost all
of the adsorbed MWLs were removed by sonication (Figure S2). Evidently, this result indicates the durability
of the covalently immobilized MWLs. The immobilization of the MWLs
to SAM was confirmed by their corresponding IR RA spectra (Figure 5). Both CMWL–SAM
and EMWL–SAM exhibit complicated vibrational bands derived
from the MWL at 900–1800 cm–1 and characteristic
bands of the unreacted azide groups on the MWLs at 2100 cm–1. The XPS spectra of CMWL–SAM show a broadened N 1s peak at
400.7 eV, indicating the formation of the triazole ring from the click
reaction (Figure 2c).
In the N 1s region, no azide peak was observed at 404 eV but a new
peak at 399.3 eV was present, which corresponds to the reported photoinduced
side reactions of azide during the long measurement time required
to collect high-resolution data.59,60 In the XPS
spectra, the intensities of the O 1s and C 1s peaks are observed to
be higher than those of the 11-click-immobilized SAM
AA-SAM due to the high O and C contents with immobilized MWL (Figure 2b,d). These results
confirm the successful immobilization of MWLs to the SAM through covalent
linking with the formation of triazole rings by click reactions.

2.5 SPR Measurements Using MWL-Anchored SAMs
The noncovalent binding behaviors of MWL-anchored SAMs toward lignin-binding
peptide C41620 were investigated using
SPR measurements. SPR measurements were performed with a two-channel
instrument (OPTOQUEST SPR02). The flow cell divides the sensor chip
into two equally sized channels, namely, a reference channel (SAM-functionalized
Au film) and a sample channel (lignin-immobilized SAM-functionalized
Au film). Both are connected to a syringe pump that was operated at
a flow rate of 20 μL/min. SPR signals (as the intensity of the
reflected light at a constant angle) were recorded over time and displayed
as mdeg units. The click chemistry-based immobilization of N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL onto SAM was efficiently performed to
fabricate sensor chips for SPR. SPR measurements were performed using
a range of C416 concentrations (i.e., 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200,
and 300 μM) in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.0) solution
(Figure 6a). With the
flow of C416 solution, SPR signal increased to reach the saturation
around 225 s due to the noncovalent interaction between the immobilized
lignins and C416 peptides. Such noncovalent interaction is weak as
reported in the previous paper,20 thus
enabling the bound C416 peptides to detach by rinsing with PBS. But,
a small content of irreversibly adsorbed peptides was not completely
detached only by rinsing and gives rise to the increase of baseline
and decrease of SPR signals, thus the residual C416 peptides were
removed by regeneration step using glycine·HCl solution for the
accurate and repetitive SPR measurements. The observed binding isotherms
clearly show the binding of the C416 peptide to the click-immobilized
N3-CMWL, in a manner similar to that observed for the physisorbed
native CMWL.20 The dissociation constant
of the click-immobilized N3-CMWL toward C416 was calculated
by the Scatchard plot to be 3.0 × 10–5 M, which
is similar to the value obtained for the native CMWL physisorbed on
the sensor chip surface, 10.3 × 10–5 M (Figure 6b).20 In addition, the dissociation constant of N3-CMWL was obtained by SPR measurements of physisorbed N3-CMWL to be 3.4 × 10–5 M, which is almost
identical to that of the click-immobilized N3-CMWL, indicating
that click immobilization of MWL does not affect the binding nature
between CMWL and this lignin-binding peptide. A similar tendency was
observed for the click-immobilized N3-EMWL and physisorbed
N3-EMWL, whose dissociation constants toward C416 were
calculated to be 1.9 × 10–5 and 3.2 ×
10–5 M, respectively, which are of the same order
of magnitude but slightly lower values than that obtained from the
physisorbed native EMWL, 7.0 × 10–5 M (Figure S2).20

and 300 μM; PBS, pH 7.0). (b) SPR response vs C416 concentration

plot.

2.6 Repetitive
SPR Analysis under Harsh Regeneration
Condition
In general, weak intermolecular interactions between
sensor materials and analytes are suitable for SPR analysis because
the detachment of analytes easily proceed. In contrast, strongly interacting
analytes need harsh condition for their complete detachment but such
harsh condition detach the sensor materials also with the conventional
SPR sensor chips, which are prepared by physisorption methods. The
covalently anchored sensor chips offer the applicability of such strong
interacting analytes to SPR analysis. To demonstrate the durability
of the click-immobilized N3-CMWL sensor chip, repetitive
SPR measurements were carried out under harsh conditions. Recycling
binding isotherms were measured by flowing a C416 solution (100 μM)
in PBS (pH 7.0) followed by regeneration with DMSO (Figure 7a). The small content of residual
peptide after the binding and rinsing steps was completely removed
by the DMSO, and the baseline is recovered (Figure 7b). During 30 cycles of C416 binding, detaching,
and regeneration of the sensor chip, negligible changes in the binding
isotherms were observed. In contrast, the simply physisorbed CMWLs
were significantly detached by DMSO, resulting in a decrease of both
the baseline and the SPR binding signal (Figure 7a). These results demonstrate the high durability
of the click-immobilized CMWLs toward repetitive analysis under harsh
conditions for SPR measurements, which originates from covalent bonding
of the MWLs to the sensor chip.

3 Conclusions
A novel SAM-functionalized
SPR sensor chip was successively fabricated
by covalently anchoring lignin at the terminal ends of the SAM. Two
types of oligo(ethylene oxide)-tethered disulfides were synthesized
for the fabrication of mixed SAMs with alkynyl and methoxy terminal
groups. IR RA, Raman, and XPS spectroscopic measurements were performed
to characterize the fabricated SAM structures. Azide-functionalized
MWLs were synthesized and used for click reactions with the mixed
SAMs to afford the first covalently lignin-anchored SPR sensor chips.
SPR measurements of the fabricated lignin-anchored SAMs showed the
substantially same binding affinity for lignin-binding peptide C416
to those of native MWLs. Repetitive SPR measurements and regeneration
under harsh conditions demonstrated the high durability and reproducibility
of the covalently immobilized MWLs.

The robustness of these
newly developed lignin-anchored SPR sensor
chips offers the availability of a wide range of solvent systems to
the SPR measurements. In addition to the analysis of weak intermolecular
interaction described herein, the present analytical method is potentially
applicable to the measurement of interactions between lignins and
large biomacromolecules, such as cellulases and hemicellulases, which
is a fundamental concern in enzymatic lignocellulosic biomass conversion
albeit being hampered by a lack of suitable sensor chip. We believe
that the covalent anchoring of structurally undefined but botanically
essential biopolymers will allow the elucidation of fundamental interactions
of those with a variety of natural and artificial molecules to spur
efficient and practical use of the renewable woody biomass.

IR attenuated
total reflection
(ATR) spectra were recorded on JASCO FT/IR-460 Plus and PerkinElmer
Spectrum One Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometers. IR
reflection–absorption (RA) measurements61 were performed on a Thermo Fischer Scientific (Madison,
WI) Magna 550 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a Harrick (Pleasantville,
NY) VR1-NIC variable angle reflection accessory mounted with a Harrick
PWG-UIR wire-grid polarizer for passing the p-polarization only. 1H, 13C, COSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded on
JEOL JNM-ECS400 spectrometers. Melting points were recorded on a Yanaco

by Fourier transformation ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry
(FT-ICR-MS) coupled with electron spray ionization technique using
a solariX FT-ICR-MS spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). Elemental analyses
were carried out at the Microanalytical Laboratory of the Institute
for Chemical Research, Kyoto University. Flash column chromatography
was performed on Wakogel 60N (Wako, 38–100 μm) and auto
column chromatography system Biotage SP1 (Biotage Corp., Sweden) or
YFLC-AI-580 (Yamazen Corp., Osaka, Japan). Centrifugation was carried
out on MCF-1350 (Laboratory and Medical Supplies). SPR measurements
were performed on an OPTOQUEST SPR02 instrument.

4.2 Materials
Solvents were purchased
from Nacalai Tesque or Wako Pure Chemical Industries and used without
further purification. Boc-l-Ala(N3)-OMe (methyl
(S)-3-azide-2-tert-butoxycarbonylaminopropanoate)
was synthesized according to the literature procedure.62 Boc-l-propargyl-Gly-OH ((S)-2-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-pentynoic acid) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.

4.3 Preparation of MWLs
MWLs were prepared
by extraction with aqueous dioxane from finely ball-milled softwood
Japanese cedar (CMWLs) and hardwood Eucalyptus globulus (EMWLs) as previously described.63 The
prepared MWL particles have a size distribution ranging from 3 to
30 μm diameter.

4.4 Azidation of MWLs
A 50.0 mg powder
of MWL was mixed with CH3CN (50 mL), methanesulfonyl chloride
(7.4 g, 64.6 mmol), and triethylamine (3.7 g, 36.1 mmol) in the ice
bath, and the heterogeneous solution was stirred in the ice bath for
1 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was washed
with Et2O (50 mL) and water (100 mL). The resulting solid
was mixed with DMSO (50 mL) and NaN3 (0.80 g, 12.3 mmol),
and the mixture solution was stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. The homogeneous
solution was cooled to room temperature (rt), and the solvent was
removed in vacuo. The residue was mixed with water (100 mL) to form
precipitate. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation to give
azide-functionalized MWLs N3-CMWL and N3-EMWL.

4.5 Preparation of Alkyne-Terminated Mixed-SAM Substrate
Gold film-coated substrates (quartz or silicon)
were precleaned by immersing into a piranha solution for 5 min and
then washed with ultrapure water. Gold substrates were immersed into
a mixture solution of methoxy-terminated disulfide 4 (1.5
mM) and alkyne-terminated disulfide 10 (0.5 mM) in EtOH
and stored at rt for 12 h. The substrates were washed with ultrapure
water to afford alkyne-terminated mixed-SAM substrates.

4.6 Procedure of Click Immobilization of Azide-Functionalized
MWL to Gold Substrates
A 1.0 mg of azide-functionalized MWL
was mixed with water–DMSO mixture solvent (1:2 v/v, 1.0 mL),
CuSO4·5H2O (0.25 mg, 1.0 μmol), and
ascorbic acid (1.8 mg, 10 μmol). The alkyne-terminated mixed
SAM-functionalized gold substrates were immersed into the solution
and shaken by HiPep Laboratories PetiSizer (1000 rpm) at rt for 12
h. The substrates were washed by sonication for 3 min in DMSO to afford
the MWL-immobilized SAM substrates.

4.7 Procedure
of Click Immobilization of Boc-l-Ala(N3)-OMe to
Gold Substrates
The click
immobilization was carried out with the same procedure of azide-functionalized
MWL.

4.8 Procedure of Amine-Functionalized MWLs
A 1.0 mg of azide-functionalized MWL was mixed with mixture solvent
of water–THF (1:1 v/v, 13.0 mL) and triphenylphosphine (341.0
mg, 1.30 mmol). The heterogeneous solution was refluxed at 90 °C
for 12 h. The solid precipitate of MWL was isolated by centrifugation,
washed with THF, and dried in vacuo to afford amine-functionalized
MWLs.

4.9 Preparation of MWL-Immobilized Sensor Chips
for SPR Measurement
At first, the surface of gold films (3.5
mm × 1.0 mm, two films for sample and reference sides) on the
sensor chip (SPR02-SDS01A, OPTOQUEST) was cleaned by piranha solution
(7:3 H2SO4/30% H2O2) and
washed by H2O. The cleaned sensor chip was immersed into
the mixture solution of 4 and 10 in a 3:1
molar ratio in EtOH at rt for 12 h. Then, the sensor chip was rinsed
by EtOH and H2O. Only the mixed-SAM-functionalized gold
film of the sample side was immersed into the mixture solution for
click reaction with N3-CMWL or N3-EMWL and shaken
at rt for 3 d. After click reaction, the sensor chip was rinsed by
DMSO and then sonicated in DMSO at rt for 3 min to remove adsorbed
MWLs. The cleaned sensor chip was docked into a OPTOQUEST prism-coupling
SPR sensor SPR02, and the adsorption of C416 peptides onto the sensor
surface was monitored using SPR02.

4.10 Baseline
Correction of XPS Spectra
Two kinds of baseline correction
methods were applied to XPS spectra
of O 1s, N 1s, C 1s, and S 2p3/2. Linear baseline subtraction
was performed to N 1s, C 1s, and S 2p3/2. Shirley baseline
subtraction was applied to O 1s.64

4.11 SPR Measurement
All SPR binding
studies were performed in PBS (pH 7.0), which was filtered (0.22 μm)
and degassed before use. After the sensor chip was docked into the
instrument, PBS was injected over the chip at a flow rate of 20 μL/min
for 20–30 min and a baseline was established for the sensor
surface. For determination of equilibrium binding, analyses were performed
at real time and at a flow rate of 20 μL/min. Solutions containing
C416 peptide dissolved in PBS were used as the samples. The C416 peptide
solutions were injected for 240 s, after which the bound peptides
were dissociated by washing with PBS buffer. The adsorption of the
peptides onto the MWL-immobilized sensor surface was then monitored.
The binding of peptides to the sensor surface was marked by corresponding
SPR angle changes. The sensor chip surfaces were regenerated using
10 mM aqueous glycine·HCl (pH 2.0) or DMSO.

Binding affinities
were calculated from a Scatchard analysis65 of equilibrium binding, based on the assumption of a 1:1 binding
model, using the equation  where [peptide], Rmax, and KD are the peptide concentration,
maximum resonance, and dissociation constant, respectively. The resonances
in the association phase at 225 s were used as the equilibrium resonance
units (Req). The Req values were plotted in the form of Req/[peptide] versus Req, and KD and Rmax were
calculated from the slope and the intercept of the linear part of
the plot, respectively. The KD values
were determined over the peptide concentration range of 12.5–300
μM.

Mixed
SAMs, containing
two or more terminal functional groups, have been used frequently
for controlled covalent immobilization of biomolecules in order to
suppress surface self-aggregation. In this case, oligo(ethylene glycol)-terminated
alkanethiolates have been widely used due to their high wettability
toward aqueous media and resistivity to non-specific protein adsorption Prime K. L. ; Whitesides G. M.
