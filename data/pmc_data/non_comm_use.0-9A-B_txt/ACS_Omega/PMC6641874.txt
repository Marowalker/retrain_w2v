We have synthesized
a novel heterostructured composite material-(ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2 wherein electron–hole recombination has
been successfully inhibited by an interfacial charge-transfer mechanism
across a semiconductor interface. As a result of this, the material
possessed enhanced photoresponse under visible light irradiations.
X-ray diffraction analysis shows the material to be highly nanocrystalline
in nature. The band gap energy as calculated from the UV–vis–diffused
reflectance spectroscopy spectrum was found to be 2.68 eV. Morphological
studies by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy analyses show the presence of distinct
microrod-shaped αBi2O3 and spherical ball-like
clusters of ZnO and Dy2O3 nanoparticles. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses confirm
the presence of Bi, Zn, Dy, and O in the material. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) analysis revealed the high surface roughness and porosity of
the prepared composite. Electron paramagnetic resonance analysis confirmed
the in situ generation of  OH•radicals under
visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic efficiency of the (ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2 composite material was evaluated by the photooxidation
of Orange G (OG) dye molecules under visible light irradiation. The
catalyst retained its original efficiency even after the 3rd cycle
of its reuse thereby validating the economic feasibility of the system.
By-product analysis by ESI-MS+ analysis proved the complete
degradation of the OG molecules from the aqueous solution.

1 Introduction
Nanocrystalline
semiconductor photocatalysts, such as TiO2, ZnO, Bi2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, WO3, α-Fe2O3, SnO2, and so forth,
have been gaining increasing attention because of
their ability to use light energy to drive a variety of chemical oxidation
reactions.1−5 These photocatalysts work on the principle of advanced oxidation
process (AOP), wherein highly reactive OH• radicals
are generated in situ when semiconductor photocatalysts are irradiated
with light of a suitable wavelength. The wavelength of light employed
depends on the band gap energy of the photocatalyst. The mechanism
of AOP relies on the photoexcitation of the valence band electrons
to the conduction band leaving behind positively charged holes in
the valance band.6−8 These holes in the valance band react with water
molecules adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, forming the OH• radicals. The OH• radicals are very strong oxidizing
agents and are capable of oxidizing and completely mineralizing a
wide range of toxic and recalcitrant organic compounds into carbon
dioxide and water.9 However, one of the
major limitations of using pristine semiconductor photocatalysts is
the rapid recombination of the electron–hole pairs thereby
hindering the generation of the OH• radicals.10−12 Thus, it is of utmost importance to increase the lifetime of the
charge carriers to increase the efficiency of the photocatalyst.13

Because of their similar band gap energies,
ZnO has been employed
as an efficient alternative photocatalyst to the more commonly used
TiO2. In addition to ZnO, Bi2O3 has
also been receiving a lot of interest, as its band gap energy lies
in the visible range. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies of
the individual metal oxides are low because of the fast recombination
of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The lifetime of
the charge carriers can be increased by combining the pristine semiconductor
metal oxides with other semiconductor metal oxides or rare earth oxides
to form composite materials. In recent years, the development of ZnO/Bi2O3 composite materials has gained a lot of interest
in the area of photocatalysis. Balachandran and Swaminathan synthesized
heterostructured Bi2O3/ZnO by a hydrothermal
method.14 Park et al. prepared one-dimensional
Bi2O3-core/ZnO-shell structures by thermal evaporation
and atomic layer deposition.15 Li et al.
have synthesized immobilized ZnO/Bi2O3 photocatalysts
wherein a microsphere lithography strategy was employed to coat ZnO
thin films by a connected Bi2O3 microgrid resulting
in the formation of the ZnO film/Bi2O3 microgrid
heterojunction.16 Movahedi et al. synthesized
ZnO/Bi2O3 mixed metal oxide by the precipitation
method.17 All of the synthesized ZnO/Bi2O3 composites showed higher photocatalytic activities
than individual Bi2O3 or ZnO. Because of the
similarities in their potentials, a heterojunction interface is formed
when Bi2O3 and ZnO are combined. This allows
the transfer of electrons from one particle to another, thereby improving
the charge separation in the composite material.14 The photoresponse of the Bi2O3/ZnO
composite has been further improved by combining it with noble metals
such as Ag18 or with transition metal oxides
such as NiO.19

In the present study,
we have combined two semiconductor metal
oxides (Bi2O3 and ZnO) with a rare earth oxide
(Dy2O3) resulting in a hybrid heterostructured
composite material of the following composition-(ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2 (ZBD). The material was found to possess enhanced photocatalytic
activity in the UV and visible regions of the spectrum. Rare earth
oxides such as Dy2O3 with their large band gap
energies (4.2 eV) are insulating materials.20 They have been used as dopants or included in composite semiconductor
photocatalysts, as they can increase charge separation by trapping
the photoexcited conduction band electrons and preventing them from
recombining with the valance band holes.13,20−22 Thus, in the synthesized composite material, the
charge separation achieved by combining two semiconductor metal oxides
will be further enhanced by the introduction of the rare earth oxide.
The photocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite was evaluated by
the degradation of a model pollutant-Orange G (OG) under visible light
irradiation. OG is a monoazo dye used commonly as part of staining
formulations in histology. It is also widely employed as a dyeing
agent in the textile industry to dye wool and silk, and in paper,
leather, and ink industries. However, OG has been reported to be a
toxic pollutant20 which is an eye irritant
and a potential mutagen and carcinogen. The molecular structure and
chemical properties of the OG dye are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

2 Mechanism
for Photoresponse under Visible Light
Irradiation
The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the prepared
ZBD composite
can be explained by the following mechanism. The energy levels at
the interface of the ZnO and Bi2O3 in the photocatalyst
have been reported to be similar to that of the Bi2O3/BaTiO3 system. When irradiated with light, electrons
from the valance band of ZnO and Bi2O3 get excited
to their respective conduction bands. No such excitation occurs in
Dy2O3 owing to its insulating properties. The
photoexcited conduction band electrons of ZnO undergo vectorial transfer
to the conduction band of Bi2O3.14,23 From the conduction band of Bi2O3, the electrons
are trapped by the empty conduction band orbitals in Dy2O3.21 The photogenerated holes
in the valance band of Bi2O3 migrate to ZnO,
resulting in charge separation in the catalytic system. This interfacial
charge transfer at the semiconductor interface24 results in an accumulation of holes which react with water
molecules to produce OH• radicals. These radicals
are responsible for the complete degradation of organic pollutants
adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst. The electrons trapped in
the vacant f orbitals of Dy2O3 react with dissolved
molecular oxygen in the reaction solution and undergoes photoreduction
resulting in the formation of superoxide radical anions. However,
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis (section 3.6) after irradiating the
prepared photocatalyst with visible light detects only the formation
of OH• radicals. This indicates the in situ-generated
OH• radicals to be the significant radical species
involved in the photocatalytic oxidation of organic molecules by the
ZBD nanocomposite material. The mechanism for the effective interfacial
charge separation that occurs in the prepared composite material is
shown in Figure 1.
Thus, the prepared ZBD composite material exhibits enhanced photocatalytic
activity when compared with the pristine metal oxides.

for the prepared ZBD material.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 X-ray
Diffraction Studies
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) studies were carried out to study the crystalline nature of
the prepared material, and the obtained pattern is shown in Figure 2a. The two most prominent
peaks at 27.5° and 33° correspond to the (120) phase of
monoclinic α bismuth oxide crystal lattice (JCPDS card no. 6-294)
and (220) phase of the tetragonal β bismuth oxide crystal lattice
(JCPDS card no. 27-50), respectively. The sharpness of the peaks indicates
the high nanocrystallinity of the material. In addition to this,
the smaller peaks at 35° can be related to the (031) plane of
α bismuth oxide.25,26 The peak at 46.3° corresponds
to the (102) phase of the hexagonal wurtzite structure of the ZnO
crystal lattice (JCPDS 36-1451).27 The
series of low intensity peaks between 50° and 60° can be
attributed to various lattice planes of Bi2O3 and Dy2O3 (JCPDS 01-079-1722).28 The absence of any other strong diffraction
peaks of ZnO and Dy2O3 is due to their lower
concentration in the material. The average crystallite size was calculated
using the Debye Scherrer equation as given below 1  where λ denotes the wavelength of radiation
equal to 0.154 nm, β is the full width at half maximum, and
θ is the half diffraction angle. The average crystallite size
was calculated to be 38.56 nm. This confirms the nanocrystalline nature
of the material.

of the prepared (ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2 material.

3.2 Fourier
Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
The analysis of the functional
groups present on the surface of
the material was carried out by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy. The spectrum was scanned in the range between 400 and
4000 cm–1, and the graph is shown in Figure 2b. The broad peak at around
3500 cm–1 is as a result of adsorbed water molecules
on the surface of the catalyst. A close look at the region between
400 and 600 cm–1 shows the presence of three peaks
at 425, 472.8, and 526.10 cm–1. These correspond
to the metal–oxygen stretching vibrations in ZnO,29 Dy2O3,30 and Bi2O3,31 respectively. The peaks between 1350 and 1500 cm–1 are a result of the symmetric stretching in C–O and C–O–C
groups.29

This could be due to the
presence of CO2 molecules that are adsorbed on the surface
of the photocatalyst. The FT-IR spectrum of the photocatalyst post
photodegradation is given below the original spectrum. Comparison
between the two spectra shows them both to be very similar. The peaks
corresponding to the metal–oxygen stretching remain unaltered,
confirming that the prepared catalyst does not undergo any changes
during the course of the photodegradation reaction. The absence of
any additional peaks in the post degradation spectrum reiterates that
the dye molecules have been completely photodegraded by the photocatalyst
and do not remain adsorbed onto its surface at the end of the reaction.

3.3 UV–Vis–Diffused Reflectance
Spectroscopy
The band gap energy and optical properties of
the ZBD photocatalytic materials were studied by the UV–vis–diffused
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) technique. The absorption spectrum
of ZBD2 is depicted in Figure 2c, whereas the spectra of the composites prepared in three
different ratios (ZBD1, ZBD3, and ZBD4) are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Figure 2c indicates the ZBD2 composite to show strong
absorption in the region between 200 and 400 nm, indicating it to
be highly active in the UV region. In addition to this, significant
absorption is also seen in the visible region. This suggests the prepared
ZBD semiconductor material to be a promising visible active photocatalyst
in addition to its UV light activity. The peaks between 800 and 1400
nm are attributed to the transitions in the f orbitals of the rare
earth metal dysprosium present in the material. The band gap energy
was calculated by plotting (αhν)2 versus hν and extrapolating the graph.
The plot is shown in Figure 2d and the obtained values for the pristine metal oxides and
the ZBD material in different mole ratios are shown in Table 1. From the values, it is evident
that the (ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2 material has the lowest
band gap energy amongst all ratios and when compared with the pristine
metal oxides. This accounts for the photocatalytic activity of the
material under both UV and visible light irradiation.

Materials in Different Molar Ratios

3.4 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis is carried out to
find out the oxidation states of the various elements and to confirm
their presence in the prepared ZBD2 material. The full survey spectrum
shown in Figure 3a
confirms the presence of Zn, Bi, Dy, and O. The C 1s peak at 284.4
eV is attributed to the adventitious carbon from the XPS instrument.14 The peak at 530 eV is due to the O 1s state
present in the metal oxides (Figure 3b). The peaks at 1021.08 and 1044.4 eV are attributed
to the Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 states (Figure 3c). This also confirms
that Zn is present in the 2+ state in the nanomaterials.32 The peaks at 158 and 163.2 eV are due to the
Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f 5/2 states, respectively
(Figure 3d).33 The peak at 1295 eV is attributed to the Dy
3d5/2 state (Figure 3e).34

3.5 High-Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy
The surface morphology of the prepared ZBD2 material was investigated
by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) analysis.
The HRSEM image is shown in Figure 4a. The image reveals the presence of distinct microrod-shaped
αBi2O3. Ball-like clusters are formed
by the spherical nanoparticles of ZnO and Dy2O3. The individual spherical particles are around 40 nm in diameter.
The image shows both the rods and spheres to be unagglomerated. The
presence of micropores between the balls would result in an increase
in the surface area of the material. This would ensure increased contact
between the surface of the catalyst and the dye molecules, resulting
in enhanced photocatalytic activity of the prepared semiconductor
nanomaterial. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) further confirms
the presence of Zn, Bi, Dy, and O in the material (Figure 4b). The individual field emission
SEM (FESEM) images of neat Bi2O3, ZnO, and Dy2O3, also prepared by precipitation method, are
given in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). These images reveal the microrod structure of Bi2O3 and the spherical nanoparticles of ZnO and Dy2O3.

(inset-SAED
pattern) of the prepared ZBD material.

3.6 High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis
was used to further confirm the shape and arrangement of the individual
particles. The HRTEM images are shown in Figure 4c,d. In this case also microrods of αBi2O3 are seen to be distributed amongst the spherical
ZnO and Dy2O3 particles. The HRTEM analysis
also confirms the unagglomerated nature of the individual particles.
The SAED pattern shown in the inset of Figure 4d reveals the highly crystalline nature of
the material.

3.7 Atomic Force Microscopy
The surface
roughness and porosity of the material was investigated by atomic
force microscopy (AFM) analysis. A 5 μm × 5 μm surface
of the sample was analyzed and the 2D and 3D images are shown in Figure 5a,b. The AFM image
illustrates the highly rough nature of the material. The average roughness
factor of the catalysts’ surface was found to be 40.97 nm.
The vertical cross section of the ZBD material (Figure 5c) shows the presence of numerous peaks and
troughs once again indicating the uneven nature of the surface. This
would be an important factor that accounts for the enhanced photocatalytic
efficiency of the material.

of the prepared ZBD
material and (c) EPR spectrum of DMPO–OH• adduct formed under visible light irradiation.

3.8 EPR Spectroscopic Studies
EPR studies
were carried out to confirm the in situ generation ofOH• radicals in the reaction solution when the ZBD catalyst is irradiated
with visible light. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide
(DMPO) is a spin trapping agent and is used to trap the generated
OH• radicals so that they may be detected
and analyzed. On analysis of the reaction solution after 20 min of
visible light irradiation, a quartet with the intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1
is obtained. The corresponding spectrum is shown in Figure 5c. The peaks in the quartet
appear at a spacing of 14 units which is characteristic of the DMPO-trapped
OH• radical. The EPR analysis thus substantiates
the formation of OH• radicals which are responsible
for the degradation of the OG dye molecules under visible light irradiation.

3.9 Determination of Surface Area of the Prepared
Photocatalysts
The surface area of the prepared photocatalysts
was measured by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm
analysis. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms of
ZBD1, ZBD2, ZBD3, and ZBD4 are shown in Figure 6(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), respectively.
From the BET isotherm, their surface areas were measured to be 8.18,
46.78, 11.03, and 9.32 m2/g. Thus, of the four prepared
ratios, ZBD2 (5:2:2) is observed to possess the highest surface area.
Its pore radius and pore volume were 10.9 nm of 0.1363 cm3/g, respectively. The highest surface area of this particular ratio
would ensure greater extent of adsorption dye molecules on the catalyst
surface, thereby resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic activity
of the material. This agrees well with the high photocatalytic activity
of ZBD2 compared with the other ratios prepared. The superior surface
properties of the ZBD2 photocatalyst is clearly observed from Table
S2 (Supporting Information).

(iii) ZBD3, and (iv) ZBD4 photocatalysts.

3.10 Photocatalytic Studies
The photocatalytic
activity of the prepared composite materials in different ratios and
the neat metal oxides was tested for the degradation of a model organic
pollutant-OG, under visible light irradiation. The results for the
degradation of 10 mg/L dye solutions with 1 g/L catalyst loading for
all materials is shown in Figure 7a. From the results, it is clear that neat Dy2O3, ZnO, and Bi2O3 show only 13,
50, and 65% dye degradation, respectively. Among the four different
ratios of the ZBD material, ZBD2 exhibited maximum dye degradation
of more than 90%. The improved photocatalytic efficiency of the ZBD2
is due to the better charge separation that is achieved in the composite
material. These results are also in agreement with the ultraviolet
diffused reflectance spectrometer (UV-vis-DRS) analysis wherein ZBD2
was found to possess the lowest band gap energy (2.68 eV) among all
of the ratios. This would ensure the superior photoresponse of the
material in the UV and visible regions of the spectrum. Thus, all
further photocatalytic experiments were carried out with the ZBD2
material as a photocatalyst. In the absence of a photocatalyst, 12%
dye removal was observed. This is attributed to the photolysis of
the OG dye molecules by the irradiated visible light.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of molar 
ratio, (b) effect of pH (inset-zero-point
charge of the ZBD2 catalyst), (c) effect of catalyst dosage, and (d)
effect of initial dye concentration on the degradation of OG dye under
visible light irradiation.

Comparison in the photocatalytic efficiency was made with
ZnO/Dy2O3 and ZnO/Bi2O3 nanocomposites
and with standard Degussa P25. Test reactions for the degradation
of OG dye under visible light irradiation were carried out and the
results are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). In all cases, 10 mg/L OG solutions were degraded with 1 g/L catalyst
loading. It is evident that after 6 h of visible light irradiation,
Degussa P25 resulted only in 62.7% OG degradation. The ZnO/Dy2O3 and ZnO/Bi2O3 nanocomposites
exhibited slightly higher degradation efficiencies resulting in 72.4
and 78.8% OG degradation, respectively. The ZBD2 material exhibited
the highest photocatalytic efficiency wherein 95% dye degradation
was achieved. Thus, comparison shows that the prepared ZBD2 composite
material possesses maximum photocatalytic efficiency.

3.11 Preliminary Reactions
Preliminary
reactions on the effect of aqueous pH, catalyst loading, and initial
dye concentration were studied to optimize the various experimental
parameters.

3.11.1 Effect of Aqueous pH
Aqueous pH
is an important parameter in the treatment of industrial wastewater.
Thus, it is essential to study the photocatalytic efficiency of the
prepared ZBD2 material across the entire range of pH under visible
light irradiation. The pH of the OG solutions was varied between 2
and 12 with the help of 0.1 N HCl and 0.1 N NaOH solutions. A catalyst
loading of 1.5 g/L and initial dye concentration of 10 mg/L were employed
for the photodegradation reactions, and the obtained results are shown
in Figure 7b. It is
evident that after 6 h of visible light irradiation, more than 90%
degradation is achieved at all values of pH with maximum degradation
occurring between pH 7 and 8. The marginal decrease in the photocatalytic
efficiency of the material in the acidic and basic ranges could be
due to the presence of excess H+ and OH– ions in the solution. These ions would get adsorbed onto the surface
of the catalyst and hinder the organic moieties from reaching the
catalyst surface. Also, under extreme acidic conditions, the excess
H+ ions could act as radical scavengers thereby reducing
the number of hydroxyl radicals available for dye oxidation.20 Thus, for the sake of cost and convenience,
neutral pH was chosen for all further photocatalytic reactions. This
is further supported by the zero-point charge of the catalyst which
was found to be 7.54 (inset of Figure 7b).

3.11.2 Effect of Catalyst Dosage
The
effect of catalyst dosage was studied to determine the optimum amount
of catalyst required for efficient dye degradation under visible light
irradiation. The catalyst dosage was varied from 0.5 to 2.5 g/L while
the solution pH and initial dye concentration were fixed at 7 and
10 mg/L. The results obtained at the end of an irradiation time of
6 h are shown in Figure 7c. From the figure, it is observed that an initial increase in the
catalyst loading from 0.5 to 1.5 g/L leads to an increase in the extent
of degradation. This is because of the increase in total active surface
area which would increase the amount of light absorbed thereby increasing
the availability of active sites on the catalyst surface. A dosage
of 1.5 g/L results in 95.15% OG degradation. Beyond this, however,
an increase in catalyst loading results only in a marginal increase
in % dye degradation. Beyond the optimum dosage, the dispersed catalyst
particles in the reaction solution would block the light rays and
result in increased light scattering.35 Thus, 1.5 g/L was fixed as the ideal catalyst dosage for the photocatalytic
dye degradation reactions.

3.11.3 Effect
of Initial OG Concentration
The effect of initial dye concentration
on the photocatalytic efficiency
of the ZBD material was studied and the results are shown in Figure 7d. In this case,
the solution pH (neutral) and catalyst dosage (1.5 g/L) were kept
constant while the initial OG concentration was varied from 5 to 50
mg/L. The obtained results show that as the initial dye concentrations
increased from 5 to 50 mg/L, the % degradation decreased from more
than 95% to around 55% after 6 h of visible light irradiation. This
decrease could be because of decreased light penetration in the solutions
of high dye concentrations. This would decrease the number of photons
reaching the catalyst surface which would in turn lower the production
of hydroxyl radicals.36 The photodegradation
efficiency is directly related to the formation of hydroxyl radical
which is a critical species in the degradation process.

3.12 Kinetic Studies
The kinetics of
photocatalytic degradation of OG was studied with different initial
dye concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/L) using the prepared
ZBD material as a photocatalyst. The previously optimized catalyst
dosage of 1.5 g/L was employed. In each case, the progress of the
reaction was monitored by withdrawing aliquots of the reaction solution
at regular intervals of time and measuring the absorbance of the solutions.
The plot of percentage degradation versus time is shown in Figure
S4a (Supporting Information). From the
figure, it is clear that as the initial dye concentration increases,
the time taken for completion of the reaction also increases. OG solution
(5 mg/L) undergoes 97.84% degradation at the end of 120 min of visible
light irradiation, whereas 25 mg/L OG solution undergoes 95.8% degradation
at the end of 660 min of visible light irradiation. In all the cases,
more than 95% dye degradation is achieved. The completion of the reactions
is also confirmed by the reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD)
of the reaction solutions during the course of the reaction. The corresponding
results are shown in Figure S4b (Supporting Information). The COD value of the 5 mg/L OG solution decreases from 480 to
32 mg/L, whereas 50 mg/L decreases from 832 to 96 mg/L under visible
light irradiation. Thus, 93% COD removal is achieved for the 5 mg/L
OG solution and 88% for the 25 mg/L OG solution. The COD levels of
the solution decrease to less than around 100 mg/L in all cases which
confirms the efficient degradation of the OG dye molecules under visible
light irradiation in the presence of the prepared ZBD material as
a photocatalyst.

The obtained kinetic data were fitted to the
pseudo-first-order rate equation as given below 2  where Co and Ce are the initial and final dye concentrations
at time t and k is the pseudo-first-order
rate constant. From the experimental data, a graph of ln(Co/Ce) versus time was plotted
as shown in Figure 8a. The rate constants for each of the initial dye concentrations
were determined, and the obtained values are shown in Table S3 (Supporting Information). From the table it is
clear that as the initial dye concentration increases from 5 to 25
mg/L, the rate constant decreased from 4.23 × 10–2 to 0.55 × 10–2 min–1. In
all cases, the R2 values are close to
unity proves the goodness of the fit. This clearly shows that the
photocatalytic dye degradation reactions follow pseudo-first-order
kinetics.

degradation of OG under visible light irradiation.

3.13 Effect of Electrolytes
Apart from
organic pollutants, industrial effluents also contained electrolytes
such as NaCl, KCl, Na2CO3, MgSO4,
and so forth. Thus, it is important to study the effect of these electrolytes
on the photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared ZBD2 material. The
previously standardized pH and catalyst dosage were maintained. Dye
solutions (10 mg/L) were photocatalytically degraded in the presence
of varying amounts (0–7%) of the electrolyte solutions. The
results (Figure 8b)
show that the presence of the electrolytes retards the dye degradation.
This could be because the anions in solution scavenge the OH. radicals that are produced on visible light irradiation.37 As a result of this, the extent of dye degradation
is lowered.

3.14 UV–Visible Absorbance
Spectrum
Figure 9a shows the
full UV-visible absorbance spectrum of the OG solutions at different
stages of its photocatalytic degradation under visible light irradiation
using the ZBD2 material as a photocatalyst. The spectrum of the dye
solution at the commencement of the reaction shows absorption maximum
at 483.5 nm. The chromophoric azo group in the dye molecule is responsible
for this absorption. As the reaction proceeds, a decrease in the intensity
of this absorption maximum is observed. This is due to the cleavage
of the azo bond during the course of the photocatalytic dye degradation
which is also responsible for the decrease in color intensity of the
solution. At the end of the reaction, the peak at 483.5 nm has completely
disappeared which shows the complete breakdown of the azo group. This
eliminates any possibility of unreacted dye molecules in the solution
at the end of the irradiation time.

3.15 Reusability
Keeping in mind the
cost of the raw materials and their environmental effect, recycling
of the photocatalyst must be considered to make the whole photocatalytic
system more practical. In this regard, the photocatalytic efficiency
of the used ZBD2 material was tested for the degradation of OG solutions
under visible light irradiation for up to three cycles. At the end
of each cycle the catalyst was filtered, washed, and reused. The obtained
results are shown in Figure 9b. In each cycle, the progress of the reaction was monitored
by measuring the absorbance of the reaction solutions withdrawn at
regular intervals of time. The percentage of degradation at the end
of the three cycles was 98.92, 97.58, and 96.23%. This illustrates
that the ZBD catalyst retains its original efficiency even after the
3rd cycle of reuse.

3.16 ESI-MS+ Analysis
The
possible intermediates that are formed during the photocatalytic degradation
of OG under visible light irradiation using ZBD2 as a photocatalyst
have been identified using the ESI-MS+ analysis. The ESI-MS+ spectrum of the neat and photocatalytically degraded OG dye
solution is shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). The absence of the peak corresponding to the OG molecular ion
at m/z 453 indicates that the OG
dye molecules have been completely degraded from the aqueous solution.
During the degradation process, intermediates of lower molecular weight
(m/z-301.19, 236.2, 167.14, 101.06,
79.08, and 71.04) are formed. On the basis of the obtained m/z values, a plausible mechanism for the
photocatalytic degradation has been proposed and is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Degradative Pathway
Showing the Fragmentation Pattern of OG Dye Molecule
with ZBD Photocatalyst under Visible Light Irradiation
The reaction proceeds by the random attack of
OH• radicals that are generated in the reaction
solution on the
OG dye molecules. The proposed pathway suggests the initial cleavage
of the chromophoric group, resulting in the formation of substituted
aromatic compounds. This cleavage is responsible for the decrease
in the color intensity of the solution during the course of the reaction.
Further reaction results in the opening of the aromatic ring to form
conjugated branched alcohols. The obtained linear molecules finally
undergo mineralization to give carbon dioxide and water. These results
prove the effective photocatalytic degradation of the OG dye molecules.

4 Conclusion
The heterostructured composite
material-(ZnO)x(Bi2O3)1–2x(Dy2O3)x was
prepared by a simple precipitation method. Effective charge separation
was achieved at the semiconductor interface followed by trapping of
the electrons in the vacant f orbitals of the rare earth oxide. The
inhibition of the electron–hole recombination process rendered
the material highly photoresponsive under visible light irradiation.
The crystalline nature of the material was studied by XRD analysis.
The band gap energy as calculated from the UV-vis-DRS spectrum 2.68
eV. Morphological studies by HRSEM and HRTEM analyses show the presence
of distinct microrod-shaped αBi2O3 and
spherical nanoparticles of ZnO and Dy2O3 that
form ball-like clusters. The SAED pattern also confirms the crystallinity
of the material. XPS and EDAX shows the high purity of the material
and the presence of Bi, Zn, Dy, and O in the material. AFM analysis
revealed the high surface roughness and porosity of the prepared composite.
EPR spectroscopy was employed to confirm the in situ generation of
OH• radicals in the reaction solution. The prepared
composite material was found to possess enhanced photocatalytic activity
for the degradation of OG under visible light irradiation. Preliminary
studies were carried out to optimize the solution pH, catalyst dosage,
and initial dye concentration. The catalyst exhibited good activity
across all values of pH. All further reactions were carried out at
neutral pH for the sake of cost and convenience. An optimum catalyst
dosage of 1.5 g/L was set for a dye solution of 10 mg/L concentration.
Kinetic studies were carried out with various initial dye concentrations.
The obtained data fitted well with the pseudo-first-order kinetic
model. A decrease in the catalytic efficiency was detected in the
presence of commonly occurring industrial electrolytes. The catalyst
was observed to retain its original efficiency even after the 3rd
cycle of its reuse thereby validating the economic feasibility of
the system. The by-product analysis, carried out using ESI-MS+ analysis proved the complete degradation of the OG molecules
from the aqueous solution.

5 Materials and Method
5.1 Chemicals Required
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate
(Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), bismuth
nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 99%), and dysprosium nitrate hexahydrate (Dy(NO3)3·6H2O 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
India. OG (C16H10N2Na2O7S2), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99.5%) were acquired
from S D Fine-Chemicals Ltd., Mumbai, India. Potassium chloride (KCl,
99%) and sodium carbonate anhydrous GR (Na2CO3, 99.9%) were procured from Merck, India Ltd. Magnesium sulphate
(MgSO4·7H2O, 99.5%), potassium dichromate
(K2Cr2O7, 99.9%), and ferrous ammonium
sulphate ((NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O, 99%) were obtained from Qualigens Fine
Chemicals, India. Concentrated sulphuric acid AR (H2SO4, 98%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were received from HiMedia
Laboratories Private Ltd. Concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) was obtained from SRL Chemicals.

5.2 Synthesis
of ZBD Composite Material
The ZBD composite material in different
ratios was synthesized by
a simple precipitation method wherein the nitrate salts were employed
as the metal oxide precursors. A typical procedure is as follows.
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.59 g) and 1.39
g of Dy(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved
separately in 20 mL of double-distilled water. Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (4.85 g) was dissolved in 50 mL of dilute
nitric acid. Here, the ZnO, Bi2O3, and Dy2O3 precursors have been taken in 2:5:2 molar ratios.
An aqueous solution of NaOH was employed as the precipitating agent.
The NaOH solution was added drop wise to the Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution with vigorous stirring until
a white precipitate was formed, and a pH value greater than 10 was
reached. To this continuously stirred solution, either of the other
two metal nitrate solutions and aqueous sodium hydroxide were added
alternately in a similar manner, resulting in a solution of pH ≈
12. Stirring was continued for 2 more hours, when the white precipitate
turned pale yellow. The solution was then filtered and washed thoroughly
with distilled water multiple times, followed by a final wash with
ethanol. The obtained solid was then dried overnight at 80 °C
and sintered in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 2 h. The sintered
powder was ground, stored in an airtight container and labeled as
ZBD2.

The above procedure was carried out taking the three nitrate
precursors in different ratios. Composites with the following overall
compositions were obtained-(ZnO)x(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)x, (ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)x(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2, (ZnO)x(Bi2O3)(1–x)/2(Dy2O3)(1–x)/2, and (ZnO)(1–x)/2(Bi2O3)(1–x)/2(Dy2O3)x, and they were labeled as ZBD1-1:1:1,
ZBD2-2:5:2, ZBD3-5:2:2, and ZBD4-2:2:5 respectively, where the value
of x = 0.56. Among these, ZBD2 exhibited maximum
photocatalytic activity. The percentages of ZnO, Bi2O3, and Dy2O3 in the ZBD2 photocatalyst
are 22, 56, and 22%, respectively.

5.3 Characterization
Techniques
The crystalline
phases and crystallite size of the synthesized photocatalytic material
were identified by the X-ray powder diffraction technique (PANalytical
X-ray diffractometer, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 Å). The 2θ scan range was between 10° and
70° with an accelerating voltage of 40 kV and an emission current
of 25 mA. Infrared transmission spectrum of the sample was obtained
using a FT-IR spectrometer (PerkinElmer). The optical properties of
the powder samples were studied using an UV–DRS (Shimadzu UV-2600,
Japan) with a scan speed of 200 nm/s using BaSO4 as standard.
The morphologies of the ZBD nanostructures were characterized by FESEM
and HRTEM (JEOL 3010). Photocatalytic activity of the synthesized
catalyst was studied for the photodegradation of OG using an annular
slurry type visible photoreactor (Heber Scientific, Chennai, India)
with a 500 W tungsten filament lamp. The absorbance of the degraded
solution was measured using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
and its COD was determined using a COD digester (Thermo Reactor HACH
DRB 200).

5.4 Photocatalytic Reactions
In a typical
photocatalytic experiment 1.5 g/L of the photocatalyst was used to
treat OG solutions of various concentrations in the slurry visible
photoreactor. A calibration graph of the absorbance values of standard
OG solutions was plotted. On completion of the reaction, the absorbance
of the degraded solution was measured and compared with the calibration
graph to determine the extent of dye degradation. Percentage degradation
was calculated using the following relationship 3  where Co is the
initial dye concentration and Ce is the
dye concentration at the end of the reaction. The progress of the
reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the reaction
solutions at the absorbance maximum of OG and by determining the reduction
in COD of the solution.
