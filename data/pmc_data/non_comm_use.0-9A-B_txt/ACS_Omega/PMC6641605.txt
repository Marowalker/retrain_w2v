Resistive interfaces within the electrodes
limit the energy and
power densities of a battery, for example, a Li-ion battery (LIB).
Typically, active materials are mixed with conductive additives in
organic solvents to form a slurry, which is then coated on current
collectors (e.g., bare or carbon-coated Al foils) to reduce the inherent
resistance of the active material. Although many approaches using
nanomaterials to either replace Al foils or improve conductivity within
the active materials have been previously demonstrated, the resistance
at the current collector active material interface (CCAMI), a key
factor for enhancing the energy and power densities, remains unaddressed.
We show that carbon nanotubes (CNTs), either directly grown or spray-coated
on Al foils, are highly effective in reducing the CCAMI resistance
of traditional LIB cathode materials (LiFePO4 or LFP and
LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 or NMC). Moreover, the CNT coatings displace the need for currently
used toxic organic solvents (e.g., N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone)
by providing capillary channels, which improve the wetting of aqueous
dispersions containing active materials. The vertically aligned CNT-coated
electrodes exhibited energy densities as high as (1) ∼500 W
h kg–1 at ∼170 W kg–1 for
LFP and (2) ∼760 W h kg–1 at ∼570
W kg–1 for NMC. The LIBs with CCAMI-engineered electrodes
withstood discharge rates as high as 600 mA g–1 for
500 cycles in the case of LFP, where commercial electrodes failed.
The CNT-based CCAMI engineering approach is versatile with wide applicability
to improve the performance of even textured active materials for both
cathodes and anodes.

==== Body
Introduction
Li-ion batteries (LIBs)
are widely used in a variety of devices
ranging from portable electronics to power tools and are projected
to become the dominant energy storage systems for electric vehicles
(EVs)1 and renewable energy generation
technologies (e.g., solar and wind). To this end, the energy and power
densities of LIBs must be significantly enhanced with a concomitant
improvement in their cycle stability. Prior battery research has focused
on identifying new active materials or engineering the microstructure
of known active materials2 for enhancing
LIB’s energy and power densities. As a result, many methods
to synthesize and process cathode and anode active materials with
high capacities are now known.3 Notwithstanding
this progress, LIBs still trail due to fundamental limitations arising
from the inherent resistive interfaces within the electrode. Most
active materials used in LIB electrodes (both anodes and cathodes)
are poor electrical conductors and must be mixed with conductive additives
for coating on a current collector.4,5 In a typical
LIB cathode (/anode) manufacturing line, an Al (/Cu) current collector
is coated (at rates 20 m min–1) with a slurry containing
the active material (e.g., LiFePO4 or LFP and LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 or NMC
for the cathode and graphite and lithium titanate for the anode),
∼5 wt % conductive carbon (e.g., acetylene black, glucose,
and sucrose), and a binder (e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), delivered at rates as high
as 150 kg h–1.6 Thus,
different types of interfaces between the grains of the active material,
conductive additive, and the current collector are inevitably formed
which constitute the total internal resistance (R) of LIBs (Figure 1). Consequently, R results in an undesired voltage
drop (or IR drop, where I is the
current) and limits the LIB performance at high power. The IR drop increases with the increasing current drawn from
the LIB (i.e., higher powers or higher discharge rates) and alters
the electrode potential from the equilibrium value leading to a rapid
decrease in energy density at higher rates.7

Figure 1 Schematic
showing various resistances in LIB cathodes. The overall
cathode resistance is the sum of the resistances arising from the
(1) active material, binder, and conductive additive coatings, (2)
CCAMI, and (3) current collector. As shown on the left, in a traditional
cathode, conductive additives decrease the electrical resistance within
the active material but do not affect the high CCAMI resistance. On
the other hand, as shown on the right, VACNTs directly grown on the
Al foil enable better electrical conduction across CCAMI, which dramatically
improves the LIB performance.

The present LIB literature is replete with different procedures
for improving the interfaces within the active materials by microstructuring
or adding conductive additives such as nanocarbons.8,9 Notwithstanding
this incremental progress, higher areal capacities, faster charge/discharge
rates, or mitigating heating losses (arising from I2R) and associated hazards in present
LIBs remain challenging. Although conventional conductive carbon additives
decrease the resistance of interfaces within the cathode/anode active
material, they are ineffective in decreasing the current collector
active material interface (CCAMI) resistance—a key driving
factor for increasing energy and power densities that has largely
been ignored in LIBs (Figure 1).

Previously, super-aligned CNTs grown on a Si wafer
were drawn into
sheets (where the vertical alignment is lost) or coated on a cellulose
paper to serve as current collectors for fabricating LiCoO2 cathodes.10,11 Although such studies replace
the traditional Al foil with CNT-based current collectors, they do
not address the CCAMI resistance within LIB cathodes. Going beyond
existing studies on the use of CNTs in LIBs, we conceptualize and
demonstrate a scalable approach for improved CCAMI using vertically
aligned CNTs (VACNTs) grown directly on Al foils to enhance LIB electrochemical
performance with different cathode-active materials in terms of high
rate capability, energy, and power densities. We hypothesize that
a thin layer of CNTs, either grown directly or coated on bare Al foils,
decreases CCAMI resistance, improves energy densities, and enables
stable performance at significantly high powers. CNTs are electrochemically
stable,12,13 and their high electrical conductivity allows
for better electron transfer across CCAMI, whereas their high surface-to-volume
ratio provides greater ion access. Previously, we demonstrated two
roll-to-roll (R2R) processes: (i) a chemical vapor deposition or CVD-based
process for growing VACNTs directly on bare kitchen-grade Al foils14 and (ii) a spray-coating process for coating
industrial-grade Al foils with randomly oriented CNTs.15 Notably, in both of these processes, binders
to adhere CNTs to the Al foil are not required. Unlike many methods
reported in the literature, our approaches to engineer CCAMI can be
readily integrated into LIB manufacturing lines by replacing the traditional
current collectors (i.e., Al foils) with CNT-coated Al foils. As delineated
below, scalably produced CNT-coated Al foils enhance the performance
of different commercially available cathode materials such as LFP
and NMC without the need for further modification by reducing the
CCAMI resistance by a factor of three. It should be mentioned that
the commercially available bulk LFP (manufacturer specified capacity:
145 mA h g–1 at C/10) and NMC (manufacturer specified
capacity: 145 mA h g–1 at C/5) active materials
used in this were not textured or coated with carbon. The engineered
CCAMI cathodes resulted in as high as >91% enhancements (relative
to bare Al foil) in energy density at a power density of 1300 W kg–1. More importantly, CNT-coated cathodes enable LIB
performance at very high discharge rates (∼600 mA g–1) for up to 500 cycles in the case of LFP, where commercial electrodes
were observed to fail. Although textured active materials16−18 show higher intrinsic capacities relative to commercially available
counterparts, they are also limited by CCAMI issues resulting from
poor interfacial contact with the current collector. In this regard,
the CNT-based CCAMI engineering approach can further improve the performance
of even textured LFP and NMC powders with higher intrinsic capacities.
In addition to improving the LIB performance, we show that CNT-coated
Al foils facilitate active materials to be coated using environmentally
benign aqueous slurries instead of expensive and toxic NMP slurries
used in the present LIB manufacturing lines. Last, the CNT-based CCAMI
engineering approach is versatile and compatible with different types
of active materials relevant for both LIB cathodes and anodes (e.g.,
lithium titanium oxide).

Experimental Section
Materials Synthesis
Growth
of VACNTs on Aluminum Foils (Al/VACNTs)
VACNTs
were grown on bare Al foils (MTI Corp.) in a two-stage furnace (Thermcraft
Inc.) in which the first stage (maintained at 200 °C) served
as a preheating zone and the second stage (maintained at 600 °C)
served as the reaction zone. A constant flow of ultrahigh purity argon
gas (500 SCCM) was maintained throughout the synthesis. Acetylene
(30 SCCM) and a ferrocene–xylene mixture (injection rate ≈
1.5 mL h–1) were introduced into the two-stage furnace
in which ∼2″ long Al foils were placed at the center
of the reaction zone. About 30 μm tall VACNT arrays were obtained
on the Al foil in a 30 min long CVD run. Further details on R2R production
using this CVD process can be found in ref (14).

Spray-Coated CNTs on the Al Foil (Al/CNT-S)
Multiwalled
CNTs (Cheap Tubes Inc.) were dispersed in isopropanol (4 mg mL–1) using a tip sonicator and spray-coated onto bare
Al foils (MTI Corp.) using a paint gun (Iwata 5095 WS400) with 1.3
mm nozzle and 29 psi ambient air pressure. Further details on the
R2R spray-coating process can be found in ref (15). The Al foils coated with
randomly oriented multiwalled CNTs were used as current collectors
for preparing the cathodes which contained LFP, conducting carbon,
and the binder.

Electrode Slurry Preparation
The
LFP/NMC cathodes were
prepared by dispersing LiFePO4 (80 wt %, MTI Corp.) or
LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (80 wt %, electrodes and more), TIMCAL Graphite & Carbon Super
P (5 wt %, MTI Corp.), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC, 1 wt %, MTI Corp.),
and styrene–butadiene rubber (SBR, 14 wt %, MTI Corp.) in deionized
(DI) water (18 MΩ). CMC was first dissolved completely in water
at 90 °C, and subsequently, SBR was added to this solution at
room temperature. LFP/NMC and carbon Super P were dried, mixed, and
added to the above solution under continuous stirring. The resulting
slurry was stirred overnight, and an adjustable doctor blade set at
100 μm was used to coat bare Al foils, and commercial carbon-coated
Al foils were procured from MTI Corp. (Al/C), Al/VACNTs, and Al/CNT-S
foils. Next, the coated Al foils were allowed to dry for 12 h at room
temperature and, subsequently, dried at 100 °C for 12 h in a
precision compact oven. The LFP and NMC mass loadings in these coatings
were ∼3.3 and 2.5 mg cm–2, respectively.

Electrochemical Testing
Coin Cell Preparation
Cathodes (dia
≈ 10 mm)
were punched, weighed, and soaked in an electrolyte of 1 M lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl
carbonate (w/w = 1:1, Sigma-Aldrich) before assembling them into 2032
type coin cells with a lithium chip (15.6 dia × 0.45 mm thick,
MTI Corp.) as the counter electrode. These electrodes were separated
by a Celgard 2325 separator (Celgard, LLC) that was presoaked in the
electrolyte. The coin cells were assembled inside a glove box where
oxygen and moisture contents were below 0.1 ppm.

Galvanostatic
Charge/Discharge
Electrochemical characterization
was carried out using a Solatron 1470E multichannel potentiostat.
LFP cells were initially conditioned by charging and discharging over
a potential range of 2.0–4.2 V at a current density of 35 mA
g–1. Subsequently, galvanostatic charge/discharge
(GCD) studies were performed at varying current densities (50–600
mA g–1) to compare their electrochemical performance.
NMC electrodes were tested from 2.5 to 4.3 V at 30 and 150 mA g–1. At the material level, gravimetric energy and power
densities were calculated based on the weights of the active materials
(LFP or NMC). The energy and power density values at the battery level
were estimated as 33% of the values obtained at the material level,
following refs (16) and (18).

Electrochemical
Impedance Spectroscopy
After conditioning,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the
cells from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz, at 0 V versus open-circuit voltage with
an ac amplitude of 20 mV.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
cross-sectional morphology of Al/VACNTs (panel a) along with those
for LFP-coated Al/VACNT, Al/C, and bare Al electrodes (panels (b–d),
respectively) as deduced from scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi
S4800). It is evident from Figure 2a that the Al foil is uniformly coated with ∼30
μm tall VACNTs. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed an equal
amount of conductive carbon additives (∼4–5 wt %) in
all electrodes17 (Figure S1).

Figure 2 (a) Cross-sectional SEM image of a VACNT-coated Al foil, or Al/VACNT
foil. Similar images for LFP coatings on Al/VACNT foil, commercial
carbon-coated Al foil, and bare Al foil are shown in panels (b–d),
respectively.

As mentioned in the introduction,
NMP is currently used in commercial
LIB manufacturing for dispersing active materials as its surface tension
(41.0 mN m–1 at 25 °C) allows good wetting
of the Al foil (surface energy: 47.9 mJ m–2). On
the other hand, the high surface tension of water (72.8 mN m–1 at 25 °C) precludes its use in preparing and coating active
material slurries.19−21 NMP is disadvantageous because of its high cost and
toxicity, which warrants the use of expensive solvent recovery systems
and stringent protocols for material handling and disposal.19 The presence of VACNTs on Al provides capillary
channels that improve wetting of aqueous dispersions, as evidenced
from contact angle measurements shown in Figure S2. The aqueous dispersions exhibited a relatively smaller
contact angle (∼60°) on the Al/VACNT-coated foil compared
to bare Al foils (∼110°). On the basis of this observation
of improved wetting, we replaced NMP with DI water and prepared aqueous
slurries to coat both LFP and NMC onto the Al, Al/C, and Al/VACNT
foils depicted in Figure 2. We used CMC as the surfactant22 to increase the suspension stability of LFP or NMC in water, whereas
SBR was used as an adhesive to bind the slurries with all of the current
collectors.

The GCD responses at two current densities (C/3
and 8C/3 rates;
1 C = 150 mA g–1) for LFP electrodes (viz., Al/VACNTs/LFP,
Al/C/LFP, and bare Al/LFP shown in Figure 2b–d, respectively) are shown in Figure 3. The gravimetric
capacities for the bare Al/LFP and Al/C/LFP were 90 and 109 mA h g–1 at a low current density (50 mA g–1, C/3 rate), respectively (Figure 3a). Consistent with our hypothesis, Al/VACNTs/LFP exhibited
a relatively higher gravimetric capacity of ∼145 mA h g–1 at the same current density. This implies that >60%
enhancement in the gravimetric capacity is possible with CCAMI engineering
through VACNTs. Remarkably, as seen in Figure 3b, the Al/VACNTs/LFP collector showed a high
areal capacity of 0.55 mA h cm–2 at C/3, which is
twice the areal capacity of the bare Al current collector (0.26 mA
h cm–2). This enhancement in the areal capacity
of ∼100% of Al/VACNTs/LFP electrodes (i) brings them closer
to the required areal capacity of 1 mA h cm–2 for
the use of LIBs in EVs23 and (ii) can be
readily accomplished by using Al/VACNT current collectors instead
of Al current collectors in the present day LIB manufacturing lines.
At 8C/3 rate, the gravimetric (Figure 3c) and areal (Figure 3d) capacities of Al/VACNTs/LFP exhibited ∼100
and ∼150% enhancements over the corresponding capacities of
the bare Al electrode, respectively. Besides investigating the dependence
of the gravimetric and areal capacities at low and high current densities,
we also examined their dependence on intermediate current densities
and summarized them in Figure 4a,b, respectively.

Figure 3 GCD profiles for various current collectors
coated with LFP (see
text for details). The gravimetric (panels a,c) and areal (panels
b,d) capacities at 50 mA g–1 (C/3 rate) and 400
mA g–1 (8C/3 rate) current densities are shown.

Figure 4 Gravimetric (a) and areal (b) capacities of
various LFP electrodes
described in Figure 2 at varying current densities (from 50 to 400 mA g–1).

The electrical resistances of
the active material (e.g., LFP),
current collector (Al), and the CCAMI act in series (cf. Figure 1) and appear as the
total internal resistance R. Although the addition
of conductive carbon (Super P in our case) provides percolating networks
within the active material, it does not improve the CCAMI resistance.
Previously, it was demonstrated that texturing the Al foil with Al
nanoneedles/pillars increased the rate capability and battery performance.24,25 The underlying mechanism in such methods is to increase the total
surface area of the current collector for achieving better contact
with the active material. However, such nanostructuring of the Al
foil increases its oxidation rate and accelerates the formation of
alumina, which could eventually result in the increase of CCAMI resistance
leading to battery failure. Here, we present a new scalable process
for growing VACNTs directly on Al foils to decrease CCAMI resistance
and consequently achieve high rate capability (as shown later in Figure 6a). Traditionally,
carbon coatings have also been used on Al foils to reduce the CCAMI
resistance and improve the battery performance.26 Indeed, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, commercial Al/C/LFP
electrodes exhibit a moderate improvement over bare Al/LFP. Many commercially
available carbon additives such as Super P (added to the active material)
contain a mixture of sp2/sp3 hybridized carbon.27 Such carbon additives (Super P in this case)
within the active material are known to form highly resistive sp3 bonds with the carbon coating on the current collector, leading
to the failure of LIB cells at high rates.27 On the other hand, VACNTs not only provide higher surface area but
also enable π–π interactions (as opposed to sp3 bonds) between sp2 content of the carbon additives
in the active material and CNTs on the current collector to decrease
the CCAMI resistance. The changes in equivalent series and charge-transfer
resistances (Rs and Rct) resulting from the presence of VACNTs in Al/VACNTs/LFP
electrodes were deduced from EIS measurements (Figure 5a). It is well-known that Rs is a series combination of electrolyte and CCAMI resistances.28 The Nyquist plot for both Al/C/LFP and Al/VACNTs/LFP
exhibited a classical single time constant behavior, which was modeled
using Randles circuit analysis (see the inset in Figure 5a).29,30 The Rs values, which is related to the
real impedance value in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plot
at Zimag = 0 Ω, were found to be
9.3 and 29.8 Ω for Al/VACNTs/LFP and Al/C/LFP electrodes, respectively.
Given that the same electrolyte [1 M LiPF6 in ethylene
carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (w/w = 1:1)] was used for all of
the cells, the threefold reduction in Rs for Al/VACNTs/LFP is attributed to the presence of VACNTs that significantly
reduced the CCAMI. In addition, the characteristic semicircle in the
mid- to high-frequency regions, which corresponds to Rct, is relatively lower (∼30 Ω) in the case
of Al/VACNTs/LFP electrodes compared to that in Al/C/LFP electrodes
(∼50 Ω).30

Figure 5 Nyquist plots (a), cyclic
voltammograms (10 mV s–1) (b), and mid-point voltages
of charge/discharge (c) for LFP electrodes.

To further characterize our electrodes, we employed cyclic
voltammetry
to monitor the intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ at
a scan rate of 10 mV s–1. A reduction in the peak
potentials during charge/discharge cycles was evident for the Al/VACNTs/LFP
electrode, viz., its oxidation peak (∼3.9 V in Figure 5b) is ∼200 mV lower
compared to that of the commercial Al/C/LFP electrode (>4.1 V).
Thus,
the difference between the anodic and cathodic peak voltages is lower
for Al/VACNTs/LFP electrodes, which is advantageous in improving the
total energy density of the cell within the 2.0–4.2 V window.17,31 The advantage of VACNTs is also evidenced in the variation of the
mid-point voltages (VM) for both charge
and discharge cycles, which is the voltage of the cell when it has
discharged 50% of its total energy (Figure 5c). The Al/VACNTs/LFP electrodes showed the
least difference (Table S1) in VM between charge and discharge cycles, which
is attributed to lower R due to VACNTs at the CCAMI
(Figure 5c). Not surprisingly,
Al/C/LFP electrodes exhibited a higher voltage drop, which is attributed
to the formation of resistive sp3 bonds at the interface.27

Through our engineered CCAMI with VACNTs,
we not only successfully
reduced the interfacial resistance but also demonstrated the superior
stability of our electrodes at higher current densities up to 4 C
or 600 mA g–1 (Figure 6a). At this high
current density (∼600 mA g–1), the cell can
be charged within ∼15 min. The gravimetric capacity of Al/VACNTs/LFP
electrodes dropped from 103 to 79 mA h g–1 after
500 cycles, which is only a 23% reduction in capacity. On the other
hand, the Al/C/LFP electrodes failed to withstand this high current
density, which resulted in highly scattered capacity values with an
overall deterioration from 67 to ∼0 mA h g–1. Hence, VACNTs on Al improve the stability of the overall electrode
by providing a stable contact with the active material during the
GCD cycles. Although some groups reported a similar high rate performance
of LFP electrodes on bare Al through hierarchical composites or LFP
texturing,16,17 it is worth noting that our process
does not require any modifications to commercially used active material
powders. Furthermore, the scalable manufacturing processes32 for VACNT-coated Al foils can be readily integrated
into LIB manufacturing lines. Notably, by using Al/VACNTs/LFP electrodes,
∼34 and 54% enhancements in energy densities were realized
at power densities of ∼150 and 1300 W kg–1, respectively, as shown in the Ragone plot (Figure 6b,c). The Al/VACNTs/LFP electrode exhibited
a drop of 27% in energy density at the highest power of ∼1300
W kg–1, whereas Al/C/LFP showed a 37% decrease (Figure 6b). Notwithstanding
the 27% decrease, the energy density of Al/VACNTs/LFP electrodes at
the material level is ∼380 W h kg–1, much
higher compared to that of ∼230 W h kg–1 exhibited
by Al/C/LFP, at the highest power density 1300 W kg–1.

Figure 6 Cyclability (600 mA g–1—500 cycles) (a),
energy vs power densities (b), and Ragone plots (c) of current collectors
coated with LFP.

The advantages provided
by CNTs were also be realized by spray-coating
randomly oriented CNTs on Al foils (Al/CNT-S) using a scalable approach
that we had previously developed.15 We
found that Al/CNT-S/LFP electrodes also exhibited a significant enhancement
(>58% gravimetric and >78% areal capacities at 400 mA g–1) in the energy and power densities compared to the
Al/LFP electrodes
(Figure S3). The R2R spray-coating method15 has a high throughput for coating Al foils (∼4
cm2 s–1) allowing for easy integration
into LIB manufacturing lines. Last, to demonstrate the universal nature
of CCAMI, we repeated the above measurements using NMC (with equal
Ni, Mn, and Co contents) as the active material. The GCD profiles
at 30 mA g–1 (C/5) and 150 mA g–1 (1 C) for different NMC electrodes with and without VACNTs, respectively,
are shown in Figure S4. At the material
level, the Al/VACNT current collectors coated with NMC showed a very
high energy density of 760 W h kg–1 at a power density
of 570 W kg–1, which corresponds to a 40% increase
due to the improved CCAMI in the Al/VACNTs/NMC electrode (Figure 6c).

Conclusions
We successfully engineered the CCAMI with CNTs on Al current collectors
and coated them with aqueous dispersions containing active materials
such as LFP and NMC for fabricating LIBs with improved performance,
stability, cycle life, high capacity, and energy density. In the case
of LFP, a dramatic improvement in the areal (/gravimetric) capacity
was observed >100% (/>60%) at low C-rates (<2 C; 1 C = 150
mA g–1) and by >150% (>85%) at high C-rates
(>2 C). The
CNT-engineered CCAMI resulted in gravimetric energy densities of ∼500
and 360 W h kg–1 at power densities up to ∼170
and ∼1300 W kg–1 at the material level (corresponding
to ∼180 and 120 W h kg–1 at 70 and 400 W
h kg–1 at the battery level, respectively) with
much higher power capability (increased charge capacity at high discharge
rates). Notably, the CNT-modified current collectors with LFP (Al/VACNTs/LFP)
withstood rates as high as 4 C for 500 cycles, whereas commercial
carbon-coated current collectors coated with LFP (Al/C/LFP) were observed
to fail at this rate. For NMC electrodes, the engineered CCAMI with
VACNTs exhibited >20% (>35%) improvement in areal (/gravimetric)
capacity
at 0.2 and 1 C rates (1 C = 145 mA g–1), leading
to energy densities as high as ∼760 W h kg–1 at ∼570 W kg–1 at the electrode level (∼250
W h kg–1 at ∼190 W kg–1 at the battery level).
