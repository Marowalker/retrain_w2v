Technologically
relevant tetragonal/cubic phases of HfO2 can be stabilized
at room temperature by doping with trivalent rare
earths using various approaches denoted generically as bulk coprecipitation.
Using in situ/ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and in situ/ex situ
site-selective, time-gated luminescence spectroscopy, we show that
wet impregnation of hafnia nanoparticles with 10% Eu oxide followed
by mild calcination in air at 500 °C produces an efficient stabilization
of the cubic phase, comparable to that obtained by bulk precipitation.
The physical reasons behind the apparently conflictual data concerning
the actual crystallographic phase and the local symmetry around the
Eu stabilizer and how these can be mediated by luminescence analysis
are also discussed. Apparently, the cubic crystal structure symmetry
determined by XRD results in a pseudocubic/tetragonal local structure
around Eu determined by luminescence. Considering the recent findings
on wet impregnated CeO2 and ZrO2, it is concluded
that CeO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 represent
a unique case of a family of oxides that is extremely tolerant to
heavy doping by wet impregnation. In this way, the same batch of preformed
nanoparticles can be doped with different lanthanide concentrations
or with various lanthanides at a fixed concentration, allowing a systematic
and reliable investigation of the effect of doping, lanthanide type,
and lanthanide concentration on the various functionalities of these
technologically relevant oxides.

1 Introduction
HfO2 represents an interesting material for high-k gate dielectric in silicon-based technology,1 optical- and scintillator-based applications,2−8 and ferroelectricity9-derived electronic
device applications. HfO2 may be used as a multifunctional
diagnostic probe for X-ray computed tomography (CT) and/or mid-infrared
biosensing.4 HfO2 nanoparticles
also show immense potential for future oncology theranostic applications.10,11

U.S. Food and Drug Administration has very recently approved
NBTXR3
a first-in-class HfO2-based nanoparticle designed for direct
injection into cancerous tumors for phase I/II head, neck, and lung
cancers.10 Though much less studied than
the ZrO2 homologue, several reports evidenced remarkable
photoluminescence (PL) and scintillator properties of monoclinic and
tetragonal/cubic phases of HfO2 when doped with lanthanide
(Ln) ions such as Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb, and Dy.5−7,12−15 As Zr and Hf are regarded as the two chemically most
similar homogenesis elements,16 HfO2 and ZrO2 are called twin oxides17,18 because of their similar crystal structure, with close ionic radii
of 0.78 Å (Hf4+) and 0.79 Å (Zr4+),19 despite their large difference in the atomic
number, Z, 72 to 40, respectively. In the bulk, hafnia and zirconia
can each adopt three different, albeit related, crystal structures
at ambient pressures, that is, monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic.20,21 The monoclinic phase of hafnia is stable at room temperature and
transforms to tetragonal at high temperatures, the former at 1720
°C and the latter at 1170 °C. At even higher temperatures
(2600 and 2370 °C, respectively), the tetragonal phases transform
to the cubic one.20,21 The technologically relevant
high-temperature tetragonal and cubic phases can also be stabilized
by doping with lower valency metals, such as rare earths. Although
it is considered that the mechanisms of phase stabilization in HfO2 are close to those in ZrO2, the microscopic origin
has not been elaborated experimentally and theoretically for HfO2 as in the case of ZrO2.18,22,23 On the different side, these are consistent
with the known chemistry of Hf and Zr: the electronegativity of Hf
is slightly smaller than that of Zr and therefore HfO2 is
more ionic and exhibits stronger crystal-field effects than ZrO2.16 Also, it is considered that
the amorphous HfO2 favors the transformation into the monoclinic
phase that contrasts with the case of amorphous ZrO2 that
commonly transforms into the tetragonal phase.24 Further, despite the close crystallographic structures,
vibrational and electronic spectra, the phonon spectra of monoclinic
HfO2 and ZrO2 differ by a blue shift and a red
shift of hafnia modes with respect to zirconia modes in the high-
and low-frequency range, respectively.25 Finally, whereas the tetragonal phase of ZrO2 can be
readily accessed below a critical size of 30 nm, the stabilization
of tetragonal HfO2 is considerably more challenging.19

To date, the synthesis of lanthanide-doped
HfO2 has
been carried out by coprecipitation,26 hydrothermal
route,27,28 sol–gel,6,8,29 pulsed laser ablation,30 spray pyrolysis, atomic layer deposition,31 combined forced hydrolysis and homogeneous precipitation,32,33 electrospinning method,34 gas-phase hydrolysis,35 aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition,29 and radio frequency sputtering15 (see also references in ref (36)). So far, doping by wet impregnation has not
been considered a viable approach. This is likely explained by the
presumable difficulties in obtaining a homogeneous distribution of
dopants substituting for the Hf lattice sites. Heterogeneity effects
in dopant distribution are expected to induce the formation of parasite
phases, such as Ln2O3 or Ln2Hf2O7,9 that are very susceptible
to occur for the high concentration of dopants usually needed for
stabilizing the high-symmetry phases of HfO2.

Here,
we present a first investigation on the effects of wet impregnation
with 10% Eu lanthanide oxide on the temperature evolution of structural
phase of HfO2 nanoparticles both in in situ and ex situ
conditions. To this end, a detailed comparison between wet impregnated
and bulk doped (coprecipitated) counterpart is performed by use of
in situ/ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and in situ/ex situ, site-selective,
time-gated luminescence spectroscopy. We found that wet impregnation
HfO2 followed by calcination in air above 500 °C stabilizes
the cubic phase of HfO2 with a similar efficiency to that
obtained by the coprecipitated homologue. Compared to bulk coprecipitation,
wet impregnation has the critical advantage of reproducibility because
of the concept of the synthesis procedure. It is therefore envisaged
that the wet impregnation route would allow a systematic and reproducible
characterization of lanthanide-doped HfO2 nanoparticles.
We also focus on the luminescence-mediated relationships between the
crystallographic and the local symmetries in the two types of doped
oxides. To this aim, we describe extensively the correlations between
the local structure around the trivalent stabilizer, structural phase,
stabilizer—oxygen vacancy association, and order/disorder effects
but also the physical reasons behind the apparent conflictual data
provided by the various characterization techniques employed in our
study. A comparison with twin oxide ZrO2 but also with
fluorite CeO2 is presented in terms of crystallization
route, phase stabilization mechanisms, vibrational properties, and
anion disorder as well as effectiveness of doping by wet impregnation.

2 Results and Discussion
Through the text, we use the
following notations for the investigated
samples: bulk coprecipitated undoped and 1% Eu doped HfO2 are labeled as HfO2 and 1Eu-HfO2, respectively,
and used as reference samples. 10% Eu doped HfO2 by bulk
coprecipitation and wet impregnation are labeled as 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2, respectively. As shown in Figures S1 and S2, the bulk elemental composition
determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy–scanning
electron microscopy (EDXS–SEM) and X-ray fluorescence converged
to the nominal concentration determined from precursors.

2.1 In Situ XRD
To the best of our knowledge,
only few studies describe the time-dependent crystallization of HfO2 behavior during annealing. As such, extensive studies have
been recently reported for thin films doped with Si, Al, and Gd in
connection with ferroelectric property.12 Here, we measured the in situ XRD patterns of 10% Eu bulk coprecipitated
and impregnated hafnia, 10Eu(B)-HfO2, and 10Eu(I)-HfO2, respectively, during heating and cooling cycles, RT →
1000 °C → RT (see the Supporting Information for Experimental Details).

We have also measured the in situ
XRD patterns of the reference samples, pure HfO2 and 1Eu-HfO2 (Figure S3) which show a structure
evolution from the amorphous state to the monoclinic phase around
500 °C. The evolution agrees with the literature, in that the
amorphous HfO2 favors the transformation into the monoclinic
phase that contrasts with the case of amorphous ZrO2 that
commonly transforms into the tetragonal phase.24 The in situ XRD patterns of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and
10Eu(I)-HfO2 (Figure 1) evolve from an amorphous state to a 100% cubic (c)
phase (PDF card 00-053-0550) at around 500 °C.

Figure 1 (Left) Comparison between
in situ XRD patterns during heating (a)
and cooling (b) cycles (RT → 1000 °C → RT) and
(right) evolution with temperature of the crystallite size (c,d) and
relative contribution of cubic phase content (e) of bulk coprecipitated
10Eu(B)-HfO2 and wet impregnated 10Eu(I)-HfO2.

On further heating to 1000 °C,
the contribution of cubic phase
decreases gradually at the expense of the monoclinic phase (PDF card
00-006-0318), and this trend continues further with cooling down to
RT. Two notable results emerge from the comparative analysis of in
situ XRD patterns of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2. First, within the instrumental limit of XRD, no additional impurity
phases such as Eu oxide (Eu2O3) or Eu-pyrochlore
(typically observed for rare earths in zirconia)37 were detected. Second, the relative content of the cubic
phase depends on the Eu doping mode. More specifically, a more efficient
cubic-phase stabilization was measured for the impregnated sample
where the relative cubic phase content reaches 82% compared to only
52% for bulk precipitated hafnia. The crystallite sizes associated
with each phase (estimated by use of Scherer equation) do not differ
significantly with doping mode, being only slightly larger for the
impregnated hafnia (Table 1). As shown in Figure S4 and Table S1, both 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2 show a similar expansion and contraction of the unit cell
during the heating/cooling cycle that points to a similar insertion
degree and distribution of Eu on Hf lattice sites.

2.2 In Situ Luminescence
To get information
on how the doping mode influences the crystalline structure at the
atomic scale, we have further investigated the in situ luminescence
spectra of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2 extracted
from the in situ Raman spectra excited at 514 nm,39 using Eu as a luminescence probe. To compare the short-range
information concerning the nearest oxygen environment provided by
Eu luminescence and bulk range, cation lattice-related information
provided by XRD,39,40 the measurements of the in situ
XRD patterns were repeated using a maximum temperature set at 600
°C (i.e., limited by our Raman instrument). As the phonon bands
were embedded into the much more intense luminescence lines of Eu
at all used excitation wavelengths (488, 514, and 633 nm), these could
not be analyzed. The in situ XRD patterns shown in Figure 2 shows that following impregnation,
the cubic phase of hafnia is fully stabilized at 500–600 °C
up to cooling down to RT. In contrast, the bulk coprecipitated counterpart
displays at 500–600 °C a mixture of 90% cubic phase and
10% monoclinic phase with the monoclinic phase content increasing
to 18% with cooling down to RT. There are no significant differences
between crystallite size evolution of impregnated and bulk coprecipitated
hafnia (Table 1). The
in situ luminescence spectra display a broad emission peaked around
613 nm (corresponding to the 5D0–7F2 transition) up to 450–500 °C whose
shape is typical of Eu emission in a disordered/amorphous state which
is in line with the XRD patterns. Above 500 °C, the emission
gets significantly narrowed, indicating the formation of a crystalline
environment around Eu in good agreement with the in situ XRD patterns.

Figure 2 Evolution
of the in situ XRD patterns and in situ luminescence
spectra during heating and cooling cycles (RT → 600 °C
→ RT) of bulk coprecipitated 10Eu(B)-HfO2 (a) and
wet impregnated 10Eu(I)-HfO2 (b). Magenta color represented
the deconvoluted contribution of the 5D0–7F2 emission of Eu characteristic to tetragonal
HfO2 (see text).

The narrow emission displays a two-feature spectral shape,
with
peaks at 606 and 613 nm whose relative contribution changes continuously
with the heating temperature. The formed emission centered at 606
nm is related to Eu in tetragonal sites (which is similar to Eu emission
in tetragonal ZrO2, well documented in the literature,
see e.g., ref (41))
and mixed distribution on cubic, monoclinic (as confirmed by comparison
with the in situ luminescence spectra of the monoclinic reference
sample, 1Eu-HfO2, Figure S3),
and possible amorphous sites because of incomplete crystallization,
respectively. As it is recognized that the concentration and local
structure of the trivalent stabilizer defines the transition from
the amorphous to crystalline (cubic) phase,23 it can be concluded that the degree of Eu insertion and distribution
in the lattice sites of HfO2 evolve in a similar way in
both wet impregnated and bulk coprecipitated HfO2.

2.3 Ex Situ X-ray Diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy,
and TEM
For the ex situ investigations, bulk coprecipitated
and impregnated hafnia were annealed in air at 500/1000/1100 °C
with a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C/min and kept at maximum temperature for 4 h. As illustrated
in Figure 3a, the XRD
patterns of 10E(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2 annealed
at 1000 °C display a mixed cubic (major) and monoclinic (minor)
phase content. Similar to in situ XRD findings, no additional impurity
phases were detected within the instrumental sensitivity limit of
XRD. However, different to in situ XRD results (Figures 1 and 2), the differences
between impregnated and bulk coprecipitated hafnia are erased, as
both present a similar phase content composed of ca. 70% cubic and
30% monoclinic phases (Table 1). This evolution highlights the dependence of stabilization
efficiency on the thermal history. It seems that shorter annealing
times used in situ experiments are more favorable in stabilizing the
cubic phase in the case of impregnation because of an increased population
of the defects.42 The nucleation of hafnia
with a high surface area of 250–300 m2/g43 occurs with the formation of small (almost indistinguishable
by X-ray) ordered segments with a monoclinic-type structure, while
major volume of the material remains amorphous as can be concluded
from the XRD pattern as well as previous studies of metal oxides from
alkoxide precursors under conditions of rapid hydrothermal route.44 The cores remain chemically pure containing
essentially only the HfO2 while Eu
is concentrated in the amorphous fraction leaving the cores intact.
The annealing results first in crystallization of the more dynamic
amorphous fraction creating domains of the cubic phase. The small
nuclei then start to grow, leading to emergence of a monoclinic less
doped fraction. Longer annealing facilitates the diffusion of Eu and
its more uniform distribution and complete crystallization, leading
to coherent properties for both bulk coprecipitated and impregnated
hafnia. Higher-temperature annealing (limited at 1100 °C by our
oven) evidence a much better thermal stability of the impregnated
hafnia with 63.2% cubic phase content in contrast with the bulk coprecipitated
counterpart with 8% cubic phase content (Table 1 and Figure S4, see also Scheme 1).

anneal temperature at 1000 °C]. Also included in (b) is the Raman
spectrum of the 1Eu-HfO2 monoclinic reference sample (anneal
temperature at 1000 °C). The Raman spectrum of wet impregnated
10Eu(I)-HfO2 is not included because of its poor signal-to-noise
ratio.

The Raman spectrum of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 is illustrated in Figure 3b where the spectrum
of the monoclinic reference sample HfO2 is also included
(for a detailed analysis of Raman spectra of HfO2, the
reader may refer to ref (45)). Despite the close crystallographic structures, vibrational
and electronic spectra, the phonon spectra of monoclinic HfO2 and ZrO2 differ by in the high- and low-frequency range,
respectively.25 As such, in the tetragonal
phase, the Eg (145 cm–1) and B1g (322 cm–1) are especially sensitive to Zr–Hf
cation change, shifting to low energy by almost 30 and 80 cm–1, respectively in HfO2.46 The
Raman spectrum of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 is broader than that of
1Eu-HfO2 reference monoclinic sample as a result of enhanced
structural disorder (defects, namely oxygen vacancies) induced by
doping and superposition of phonon bands characteristic of monoclinic
and tetragonal/cubic phases, in agreement with
XRD patterns.

and (d) 15.96 at. % related to cubic phase. Bottom: Bottom: HAADF
STEM images and EELS elemental maps of O, Eu, and Hf across the framed

For example, the broad band at
500 cm–1 appears
to be a convolution of phonon modes characteristic of monoclinic and
tetragonal phases. Interference from the relative intense Eu luminescence
was discarded on the basis of invariance of phonon bands with excitation
wavelength (488, 514, and 633 nm). The phonon doublet at 179, 190
cm–1 characteristic of monoclinic ZrO2 is shifted to lower energies at 135, 150 cm–146 in HfO2, and only high energy tail
of the latter mode being detected. Noteworthy, the presence of the
phonon band characteristic of cubic hafnia (F2g) around
630 cm–1 could not be revealed in both 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2 samples. The phonon modes characteristic
to Eu2O3 C-phase (with the most intense around
380 cm–1) were not detected.

TEM images of
10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2 are gathered in Figures 4 and 5 [a selection of energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) spectra is included in Figure S2]. Generally, the chemical mapping by scanning TEM–electron
energy loss spectroscopy (STEM–EELS) spectra imaging performed
at nanometric scale did not reveal any local segregation of Eu at
the grain boundaries, irrespective of the sample type. A relative
narrow range of particle sizes was measured, ranging from 20 to 40
nm that suggest a mild agglomeration when compared with the values
of crystallite sizes estimated from XRD (Table 1).

Low-magnification TEM images show
the formation of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 nanopowder with a grain size
around 30 nm (Figure 4a). The selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) patterns show the coexistence of monoclinic (Figure 4c,d) and cubic phases
(Figure 4b) as indicated
by the Miller indices m (diffraction rings 100m, 110m, −111m, PDF card 00-006-0318) and c (111c assigned
to the 0.294 nm interplanar distance or 2θ = 30.38°, PDF
card 00-053-0550), respectively. The high-angle annular dark-field
(HAADF) STEM image (bottom of Figure 4) sustains a rather uniform distribution of all the
chemical elements across the analyzed area, with no evident trend
of chemical segregation of Eu dopant.

Figure 5 contains
the TEM results measured on a nanograin of 10Eu(I)-HfO2. The corresponding SAED pattern agrees with a monoclinic HfO2 phase, as indicated by the Miller indices (Figure 5b) with Eu concentration in
the nanograin specimen varying locally from 2 to 3 at. %. The (HAADF)
STEM images show, as for the bulk coprecipitated HfO2,
a rather uniform distribution of all the chemical elements across
the analyzed area, again, with no evident trend of chemical segregation
of Eu dopant. The electron diffraction patterns presented in Figure 5c,d correspond to
two additional nanograin specimens with measured Eu atomic concentrations
of 8.68 and 15.96 at. %, respectively. Although for the bundle with
8.68 at. % Eu the 100m, 110m, and −111m diffraction
rings (or spots) still indicate the presence of monoclinic phase (Figure 5c), these are scarcely
present for the nanograin with 15.96 at. % Eu (Figure 5d).

In all, extensive analysis of HRTEM
images, HAADF STEM images and
EELS elemental maps confirm the resemblance of the impregnated and
bulk precipitated hafnia in what means the phase content, mild aggregation
effects, and the absence of chemical segregation.

2.4 Luminescence as a Local Probe Tool
2.4.1 Site-Selective,
Time-Gated Emission Properties
The local symmetry around
the Eu stabilizer changes from low C2/C1 symmetry in
the monoclinic phase to higher D2d and Oh symmetries
in the tetragonal phase and cubic phase, respectively (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 (Top) Configuration
of Oxygen Atoms around Hf in Monoclinic, Tetragonal,
and Cubic Phases. (Bottom) Space Groups, Point Symmetry Groups around
Hf, Coordination, and Ionic Radii of Hf in the Monoclinic, Tetragonal,
and Cubic Phases
Given the well-known sensitivity of Eu luminescence to
local symmetry,47 we performed extensive
site-selective laser
excitation across 220–580 nm range spanning the absorption
profiles of HfO2, O2––Eu oxygen
charge-transfer band around 250–60 nm48 and f–f absorptions of Eu at 80 K. A selection of excitation
spectra is illustrated in Figure S5. A
number of 25 emission spectra of 10Eu(B)-HfO2 and 10Eu(I)-HfO2 obtained under excitation across the 7F0–5D2 absorption transition at 464 nm
(Figure S5) are illustrated in Figure 6. For comparison,
a similar large selection of emission spectra of 1Eu-HfO2 (monoclinic reference sample) is also included in this figure.

Figure 6 Dependence
of the emission spectra of bulk coprecipitated 10Eu(B)-HfO2 (a) and wet impregnated 10Eu(I)-HfO2 (b) on the
excitation wavelength showing a complex superposition of broad and
narrow spectral features. The dotted magenta line in (a–c)
highlights the position of the tetragonal fingerprint emission (peak
at 606 nm). For comparison, (c) illustrates the dependence of the
emission spectra of 1Eu-HfO2 (monoclinic reference sample)
on the excitation wavelength. Besides a disordered Eu distribution,
at least two distinct nonequivalent Eu in ordered monoclinic sites
were separated with characteristic narrow emission spectra fully colored
with deep and olive green.

Several common features emerge from the comparison of spectra
gathered
in Figure 6: (1) Eu
displays a multitude of ordered and disordered crystal-field environments
as supported by the strong dependency of the emission shape characteristic
of 5D0 level on the excitation wavelength and
broad distribution of the emission widths varying from 1 to 10 nm;
(2) there is no parasite emission, likely related to Eu2O3 (see a selection of our measured spectra in Figure S8) or Eu2Hf2O7 (compared with literature, e.g., ref (49) and considering the Eu
emission characteristic of both highly ordered pyrochlore and disordered
fluorite sites49,50). Moreover, no emission characteristic
of surface Eu could be differentiated with both types of hafnia samples.
To this aim, time-gated luminescence with short delay/gate width was
performed with excitation spanning the 464 nm absorption. Surface
Eu species are usually characterized by distinct emission and short
lifetime as a result of strongly distorted environment and nonradiative
energy transfer to defects;51 (3) the contribution
of the monoclinic-type emission (see for comparison the emission spectra
of monoclinic reference 1Eu-HfO2 in Figure 6c) to overall luminescence spectra seems
artificially enhanced, considering that the bulk coprecipitated and
impregnated HfO2 display a similar 70% cubic and 30% monoclinic
phase content by XRD (Table 1). This is likely due to larger radiative emission rates of
europium in the low, monoclinic symmetry compared to more symmetrical
cubic sites.52 (4) The spectral feature
around 606 nm emerges as strongly intermixed with other emissions
at several excitation wavelengths being separated only by use of time-gated
spectroscopy (30 ms delay after laser pulse and 30 ms gate) under
excitation at selected wavelengths (Figure S7). Finally, the emission properties of bulk coprecipitated and impregnated
hafnia are similar not only in terms of emission but also excitation
spectral shapes (Figure S5) and emission
dynamics (Figure S6). Collectively, the
luminescence results evidence a similar local structure and distribution
on Hf lattice sites (based on the comparison of emission/excitation
spectra) but also identical nonradiative relaxation pathways likely
because of the interaction with defects (based on the comparison of
emission decays).

2.4.2 Correspondence between
the Structural Phase
and Local Symmetry
It is usually considered that phase stabilization
of hafnia by trivalent doping bares resemblance to the case of ZrO2.23,53 Li et al.53 showed
that oversized aliovalent rare earth cations are effective for the
stabilization of tetragonal and cubic phases at room temperature via
generation of the oxygen ion vacancies and their association with
Zr(4+)/Hf(4+) cations.18,23 Compared to ZrO2,
density functional calculations estimated that the oversized trivalent
rare earth dopants stabilize preferentially the cubic phase and not
the tetragonal one.23 Experimental studies
give, however, mixed results on the exact nature of phase (tetragonal
vs cubic) stabilized by lanthanides in hafnia. For example, based
on XRD patterns, a tetragonal phase is confirmed in HfO2 doped with 20% Tb [thin films,54 15%
Tb [nanoparticles,55 7% Lu [nanoparticles,56 cubic in 5% up to 15% Eu doped HfO2 nanoparticles, or 10% Eu (or 1% Eu 10% Lu)8 and 7% Lu doped HfO2 nanoparticles.48 On the basis of the XRD patterns and Raman spectra, the
formation of a tetragonal phase is confirmed in Eu (10 and 15%) doped
HfO2 [nanoparticles,28 or 25%
Eu [nanopowders and thin films.56 The ex
situ/in situ XRD patterns (Figures 1, 2, and 3a) and TEM data (Figures 4 and 5) evidence a mixed cubic–monoclinic
phase content. In contrast, the Raman spectra suggest rather a mixed
tetragonal–monoclinic phase content (Figure 3b) as the presence of the characteristic
broad phonon band of fluorite HfO2 around 630 cm–1 could not be confirmed. A definite discrimination of the cubic phonon
band against the more intense monoclinic and tetragonal phonon bands
is difficult, as the latter bands have relative greater scattering
cross sections57 and therefore predominate
in the Raman spectra.

The apparent conflict between the crystallographic
phase and local symmetry may be solved by considering the phase diagram
of rare-earth-stabilized HfO2 described by Yashima et al.58 together with luminescence data. According to
Yashima et al.,58 the phase diagram comprises
two metastable tetragonal phases, t′ and t″, besides
the three equilibrium phases: monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic. In
particular, the t″ form (pseudo cubic) is described as cubic
like, c/a ≈ 1, with a cubic
cation lattice, but with a tetragonal anion lattice, and therefore,
this phase cannot be discriminated by XRD. This phase was experimentally
observed for the extensively investigated yttrium-stabilized zirconia
but still denoted as tetragonal ZrO2.59 Albeit the cubic and pseudocubic phases can be, in principle,
discriminated by use of Raman scattering which is sensitive to small
oxygen displacements, a clear demarcation of the two phases remains
difficult.58 On the other side, as the
Eu emission in the pseudocubic sites is quite similar to that in tetragonal
sites (characterized by distinct spectral feature at 606 nm,60,61 see also magenta line spectra assigned to Eu in tetragonal phase
in Figure 6), the cubic
and pseudocubic phase can be differentiated in luminescence. We conclude
that while the crystallographic phase composition of impregnated and
bulk coprecipitated hafnia is a mixture of monoclinic (minor) and
cubic (major) phases determined by XRD, the local structure around
Eu determined by luminescence corresponds to monoclinic and pseudocubic/tetragonal
phase, the latter being obviously associated with the spectral feature
at 606 nm. Eu luminescence thus serves as an efficient mediator for
the apparently contradictory average and local structure information.62 It is worth noting that the luminescence of
Eu in cubic HfO2 is quite similar to that in tetragonal
ZrO2 (at an identical concentration of 10%) in terms of
emission/excitation spectral shapes63 that
point to the same tetragonal structure around Eu in the two oxides
despite their distinct average structures.

2.4.3 Comparison
between Cubic HfO2 and CeO2
Time-gated,
site-selective excitation
measurements on bulk coprecipitated/impregnated hafnia confirmed the
absence of characteristic of Eu in the cubic lattice sites with no
nearby vacancy (or not locally charge compensated). Note that the
detection sensitivity of our emission spectroscopy instrument is around
100 ppm that, together with the exceptionally longtime delays used
(greater than 30 ms), would allow a good separation of the long-lived
Eu emission in the high-symmetry cubic phase of HfO2, if
any. Theoretically, such an emission should display a single emission
line corresponding to 5D0–7F1 magnetic dipole transition around 590 nm, which is
the only 5D0-related emission transition allowed
in the inversion, cubic Oh symmetry. The absence of the emission characteristic to isolated
Eu in cubic HfO2 is opposite to the case of fluorite CeO2, where such emission could be detected up to 10% Eu concentration.64

2.4.4 CeO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 Represent a Unique Family of Oxides
That Are Tolerant to
a High Amount of Trivalent Lanthanide Oxides Added by Wet Impregnation
The advantage of wet impregnation over the traditional synthesis
approaches is straightforward: the same batch of preformed HfO2 nanoparticles can be doped with different lanthanide concentrations
or with various lanthanides at a fixed concentration allowing a systematic
and reliable investigation of the effect of doping, lanthanide type,
and lanthanide concentration on the functionalities of HfO2. It is interesting to note that a modified wet impregnation approach
was claimed recently to benefit for the above advantages in the synthesis
of Mn-doped CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I) perovskite nanocrystals.65 Finally, on consideration of our previous results
on wet impregnation of CeO2 and ZrO263,66 we can draw the conclusion that CeO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 represent, to the best of our knowledge, a
unique case of family of oxides that are extremely tolerant to high
amount of lanthanide oxides that can be doped by wet impregnation.
Apparently, such behavior is due to the common ability of fluorite
structured oxides to accommodate a large amount of oxygen vacancies.
Compared to CeO2 that can dissolve by wet impregnation
up to 20%66 or even 30%67 lanthanide oxides retaining its cubic phase, ZrO263 and HfO2 can also dissolve
by wet impregnation, 10–20% lanthanide oxides, transforming
into the tetragonal and cubic forms, respectively.

3 Conclusions
We show that wet impregnation of hafnia
nanoparticles with 10%
Eu followed by calcination in air above 500 °C produces an efficient
stabilization of the cubic phase of hafnia nanoparticles, comparable
to that obtained by bulk precipitation. These findings are demonstrated
by use of in situ/ex situ XRD, Raman spectroscopy,
TEM, and in situ/ex situ luminescence spectroscopy. The relationships
between the average and local structure properties and the physical
reasons leading to the apparent conflictual data provided by various
characterization techniques are discussed. Although the major crystallographic
phase symmetry determined by XRD is cubic, luminescence data indicate
that a tetragonal environment describes better the local structure
around the Eu stabilizer. Considering the previous reports, we conclude
that CeO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 represent
a unique case of family of oxides that can dissolve by wet impregnation
a high amount of lanthanide oxides without phase separation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Nanoparticle Synthesis
Pure (undoped)
and bulk coprecipitated (1 and 10% Eu) HfO2 were prepared
by the rapid hydrothermal synthesis, that is, by immersion of alkoxide
precursor powders into boiling water.68,69 Impregnated
HfO2 with 10% Eu were prepared by impregnation of 1 g HfO2 with a 0.004 M solution of EuCl3·6H2O (Fluka). The suspensions were stirred 12 h at 60 °C and then
the separated solid was dried for 4 h at 80 °C under vacuum.
In a typical synthesis, aqueous metal nitrate solutions are mixed
with citric acid, in a molar ratio of 1:1.2, and stirred for 1 h at
a constant temperature of 60 °C. The resulting solution is evaporated
in a vacuum rotavapor at 60 °C until a gel was obtained. The
gel was dried at 60 °C for 5 h in an oven with vacuum and at
120 °C without vacuum overnight. The samples were calcined at
500, 1000, and 1100 °C in air with a heating/cooling rate of
10 °C/min and kept for 4 h at the maximum annealing temperature.
The samples were also subjected to in situ heating/cooling experiments
between RT→1000/–600 °C→RT with a heating/cooling
rate of 10 °C/min and kept for 10 min at a set temperature. The
characterization of the porous texture of the as-synthesized and calcined
samples was performed by N2 adsorption at −196 °C
using a Micrometrics instrument (ASAP 2010). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method was used to calculate the surface area from the data obtained
at P/P0 between 0.01
and 0.995.

4.2 Compositional, Structural,
and Morphological
Characterization
SEM micrographs and EDX spectra were acquired
by the use of a FEI Inspect S electron scanning microscope. Microbeam
X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) spectrometry was performed on a custom-made
instrument with an X-ray tube: Oxford Instruments, Apogee 5011, Mo
target, focus spot ∼40 μm, maximum high voltage—50
kV, maximum current—1 mA, Amptek X-123 complete X-ray spectrometer
with Si-PIN detector. The key element of the micro-XRF instrument
is an X-ray polycapillary minilens (IfG-Institute for Scientific Instruments),
which provides a focal spot size on the sample of 15–20 μm.
Powder XRD patterns were recorded on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA)
at a scanning speed of 0.10°/min in the 6–60° 2Θ
range inside an in situ cell accessory in the 30–1000 °C
temperature range. The heating rate was 10 °C/min and the samples
were kept for 10 min at the set temperature before collecting the
diffractogram. Ex situ experiments were carried out in the same apparatus
in the 10–90° 2Θ range. The crystallite size was
estimated with Scherrer equation and the cubic–monoclinic ratio
was calculated using the Toraya methodology.38 Raman spectra were acquired with 0.7 cm–1 resolution
in the extended spectral region from 150 up to 4000 cm–1. Raman analysis was carried out with a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM
HR UV–visible–NIR Raman microscope spectrometer (∼0.4
μm resolution on X and Y axes
and ∼0.7 μm resolution on Z axe) at
514 nm. In situ experiments were carried out in the same apparatus
up to 600 °C. The heating rate was 10 °C/min and the samples
were kept for 10 min at the set temperature before collecting the
spectrum. For TEM measurements, the samples have been prepared by
grinding in a mortar followed by ultrasonic dispersion in ethanol
and drop casting on a TEM grid provided with a holey carbon membrane.
The specimens have been analyzed using two electron microscopes. The
low-magnification and HRTEM images as well as the EDS spectra have
been recorded using a JEM 2100 analytical TEM operated at 200 kV.
The elemental mapping by STEM–EELS spectrum imaging has been
performed on a probe aberration-corrected JEM ARM 200F instrument.

4.3 Luminescence Measurements
The PL
measurements were carried out at room temperature and T = 80 K (by the use of an exchange gas cryostat) using a FluoroMax
4 spectrofluorometer (Horiba) operated in both the fluorescence and
the phosphorescence mode. The repetition rate of the xenon flash lamp
was 25 Hz, the integration window varied between 0.1 and 0.5 s, the
delay after flash varied between 0.03 and 25 ms, and up to 30 flashes
were accumulated per data point. For excitation spectra, the slits
were varied from 0.1 to 1 nm in excitation and from 1 to 3 nm in emission.
Time-resolved (gated) emission spectra (TRES) were recorded at room
temperature and T = 80 K (by use of exchange gas
cryostat) using a wavelength-tunable NT340 Series Ekspla OPO (Optical
Parametric Oscillator) for sample excitation (210 ÷ 2300 nm)
operated at 10 Hz. The tunable wavelength laser has a narrow line
width (<5 cm–1, which makes the laser a high
selective excitation source) with a scanning step and output energy
depending on the spectral region. As detection system, an intensified
charge-coupled device (iCCD) camera (Andor Technology) coupled to
a spectrograph (Shamrock 303i, Andor) was used. The TRES were collected
using the box car technique. The gain of the microchannel plate gain
was set to 100. The emission was detected in the spectral range of
500 nm < λem < 750 nm with a spectral resolution
from 0.05 to 0.45 nm and the input slit of the spectrograph was set
to 10 μm with a delay after the laser pulse varying from few
microseconds to 40 ms. The temperature of the iCCD was lowered at
−20 °C for a better signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For all
measurements done by iCCD, cutoff filters were used to protect the
detector from the excitation light.
