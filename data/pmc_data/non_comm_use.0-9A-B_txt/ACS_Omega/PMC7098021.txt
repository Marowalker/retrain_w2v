Laser
ablation in liquid (LAL), one of the promising pathways to
produce nanoparticles, is used herein for the modification of the abundant biowaste, calcium lignosulfonate
(CLS), adorning it with palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs). The ensuing
Pd/CLS nanocomposite, fabricated via a simple stirring method, is
deployed for hydrogen storage and environmental cleanup studies; a
hydrogen storage capacity of about 5.8 C g–1 confirmed
that Pd NPs serve as active sites for the adsorption of hydrogen.
Additionally, the novel, sustainable, and reusable nanocomposite also
exhibits superior catalytic activity toward the reduction of hexavalent
chromium [Cr(VI)], 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and methylene blue (MB) in
an aqueous solution in a short time; the synthesized nanocatalyst
could be reused for at least eight successive runs.

Introduction
It is universally known today that growing
global pollution problems
at an alarming rate are responsible for major irreparable damages
to the environment. The rapid industrialization is liable for several
environmental impacts on humans’ life, such as climate change,
water pollution, water scarcity, and unhealthy air, among others.
Besides, depleting natural resources need to be envisaged as a sensitive
matter. Meeting the society’s demands requires alternative
biofriendly and sustainable energy resources1 that do not contribute to much polluting emissions such as fuel
cells. Hydrogen produced from water is one of the renewable energy
forms that embraces this definition.2,3

Aiming
for this sustainable target, the design and synthesis of
novel materials in a greener fashion from renewable and abundant resources
has been the main objective.4−6 Among the bio-based materials,
after cellulose, lignin is the most widely known naturally occurring
biopolymer7 comprising of cross-linked
amorphous copolymer bonded together by means of different C–O–C
and C–C linkages. The ineptest characteristic of lignin would
be impermeability, which possibly can be addressed by introducing
various functional groups in lignin,8 sulfonation
being more adaptable for application in industrial products.7,8 The enhancement of its water-soluble properties is the consequence
of hydrophilic groups, such as sulfonate, phenolic hydroxyl, as well
as alcoholic hydroxyl.9 In the presence
of sulfonic groups, carbon chain, hydrophobic groups, along with hydrophilic
groups, lignosufonate (LS) shows good surface activity and acts as
a catalyst.10 According to the production
process deployed, diverse ion-based LS can be obtained as calcium,
sodium, or magnesium lignosulfonates.8 LS,
a three-dimensional network structured polyphenolic compound, can
be simply oxidized electrochemically7 and
makes an ideal substrate to decorate with nanoparticles thus modifying
and fine-tuning its properties for high-end applications,6 namely, for energy storage and in catalysis.7,11

Synthesis of nanocomposite-based materials for the hydrogen
storage
study has been one of the active research fields; nanocomposites encompassing
nickel, palladium, platinum, and some metal oxide have the ability
for hydrogen adsorption and desorption.12 Among these metals, Pd shows a unique ability for adsorption of
hydrogen atom because of its structure,13,14 and adorning
Pd NPs on such materials can turn them into effective catalysts for
adsorption/desorption of hydrogen atoms15 and also reduction/degradation of environmental pollutants;16−21 such activity for hydrogen storage has been studied in nanocomposites,
including Si wafer12 and single- and multiwalled
carbon nanotubes.22,23

Environmental contamination
comprises water-, soil-, and air pollution
that has been commonly caused by using poisonous/hazardous chemicals,
namely, nitrophenols, heavy metals, and organic dyes, among others.15,17−19,24 Two main types of pollutants
such as nitro compounds and toxic dyes are mostly used in diverse
industries, e.g., drugs, papers, ceramics, cosmetic printing, food
processing, and especially textiles. The toxic nitrophenols (especially
4-NP) are largely responsible as the main environmental pollutants25,26 and must be converted into harmless aminophenols (especially 4-AP)
that are prospective intermediates and precursors for pharmaceuticals,
synthetic resins, pesticides, and dyes ideally via a reductive protocol.17,18,26−28 Another hazardous
heavy metal in wastewater is [Cr(VI)], produced during some large-scale
industrial processes. Trivalent chromium [Cr(III)], in contrast, has
100-fold less toxicity and can be efficiently eliminated via the formation
of insoluble hydroxides in water under controlled conditions.17,29−31 Consequently, it is obligatory to develop efficient,
ecofriendly, and sustainable methods for the treatment of nitro compounds,
organic dyes, and heavy metals, thus addressing both the energy demand
and environmental issues; the assembly of nanocomposites and modified
nanoparticles does inspire newer strategies for the degradation of
pollutants and environmental remediation.32−38

Nanoparticle fabrication by laser ablation in liquid (LAL)
is an
enticing approach39−41 that provides a simple method that is adaptable for
various media and conditions; Pd NPs have been produced by LAL and
examined for their catalytic42 and energy
storage applications,43 electrochemical
means being the promising option to store hydrogen.12 The main advantage is that it does not require extreme
conditions, e.g., compression and condensation.44 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an indispensable technique for
a wide range of materials to study adsorption/desorption of hydrogen.
In an alkaline environment, the CV technique shows water decomposition
and adsorption and desorption of hydrogen atoms by means of working
electrode12,45 whereas UV–vis spectroscopy complements
as a convenient method to monitor the conversion processes.

Introducing a new nanocomposite based on an abundant, renewable,
and biofriendly material and utilizing a safe method to generate Pd
NPs are the first aim of this paper. In search of improving hydrogen
storage properties, LS was decorated with Pd NPs wherein the LAL process
was deployed to fabricate Pd NPs. Finally, Pdx/CLS
nanocomposite was constructed via a straightforward method (Figure 1a). The hydrogen
adsorption/desorption of metal NPs was studied by electrochemical
means in 1 M KOH as medium. CV and cyclic life performance were carried
out to assess the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes. Besides,
catalytic performance of the prepared Pdx/CLS nanocomposite
was investigated to reduce and degrade environmental pollutants, namely,
4-NP and methylene blue (MB) with NaBH4 and Cr(VI) with
biomass-derived formic acid (HCOOH) in water.

Results
and Discussion
Hydrogen Storage Mechanism
CV is
an acceptable method
to study the electrochemical behavior of materials. In the present
work, to investigate hydrogen adsorption/desorption, we applied CV
tests to the CLS and Pdx/CLS electrodes and also
to the pure stainless-steel mesh, which is the substrate of the nanocomposite
electrode. By applying potential in an alkaline solution, at first,
water decomposition (H2O + e– →
H + OH–) was observed. This generated hydrogen tends
to adsorb onto nanocomposites because of the electrode electric polarization
under the applied potential. When the potential begins to decline,
the liberated hydrogen atoms lead to recombination with OH– to form H2O. In the anodic and cathodic direction, the
equation involved is 1  where [W]
represents the working electrode
host cites.

Nanocomposite Characteristic
XRD
pattern was studied
crystallographically for the synthesized product. In addition, XRD
was carried out to evaluate the influence of Pd NPs on the structure
of Pdx/CLS. Subsequently, the XRD pattern of Pdx/CLS and Bragg’s law were applied for estimation
of the lattice parameter of Pd; Figures 2a−d shows the XRD pattern of CLS and
Pdx/CLS, respectively; sharp peaks indicate that
all synthesized samples are well crystallized. The strong and sharp
peaks of CLS suggest that it exists as ultrathin nanosheets, which
make an ideal space for loading of Pd NPs.46 The XRD pattern of Pd100/CLS shows two strong reflection peaks at
40.119 and 68.121° associated with arrangement of (111) and (220)
planes of Pd (JCPDS 46-1043). These diffraction peaks were assigned
to Pd structure, thus confirming the successful formation of Pd100/CLS.
When curves were meticulously compared, a significant decrease in
intensity was observed around 26.62, 29.3, and 36.4° owing to
the immobilization of Pd NPs. It is interesting to note that Pd has
a face-centered cubic structure; the lattice parameter of Pd can be
achieved using XRD pattern and following the equation (Bragg’s
law)47 2   3  where a is the lattice parameter
of the cubic crystal; h, k, and l are the Miller indices of the Bragg plane; λ is
the wavelength of the X-ray radiation used; and dhkl is the distance between layers in a crystal. The strong
and sharp diffraction peak of the (111) Bragg plane was employed to
estimate lattice parameters of all samples. Moreover, the mean crystalline
sizes were gauged by Scherrer’s equation48 and XRD data. The equation used was 4  where
λ = 0.154 nm, β is the full
width of half-maximum intensity (FWHM) in radians, and θ is
the Bragg diffraction peak. The calculated results by using eqs 2, 3, and 4 are presented in Table 1. Our procedural increase in time did not
affect the mean crystalline sizes, which is considered an obvious
benefit.

FT-IR provides analysis
to justify the presence of functional groups
in the materials. Figure 3 shows representative FT-IR spectra, recorded in the wavenumber
range 400–3800 cm–1, for CLS and Pd100/CLS.
The comparison of the spectrum of lignin8 and CLS (Figure 3a) shows the same main structural features of the samples. This is
undoubtedly beneficial because the sulfonation did not alter the main
structure and change just appeared in the lignin chains.8 The most characteristic infrared bands of CLS
appeared at 3000–3500 cm–1 (Figure 3) associated with the OH stretching.8,46,49 As shown in Figure 3b, the spectrum of Pd100/CLS
shows the same peaks as CLS. The Pd NPs’ immobilization on
CLS did not generate any significant peaks but simply influenced the
intensity of functional groups; the intensity of the main peaks of
CLS and Pd100/CLS is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 FT-IR spectrum for (a) CLS and (b) Pd100/CLS.

The surface structure is studied in terms of the
adsorption/desorption
N2 at 77 K on the CLS and Pd100/CLS surface, and the results
are shown in Figure 4 and summarized in Table 2. Figure 4a
shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm of the samples,
which suggests that the adsorption hysteresis loop in the P/P0 range is from 0.7 to 0.99.
This is likely due to the filling and draining of the mesopores by
capillary condensation and usually attributed to bottleneck pores.29 While comparing N2 adsorption for
CLS and Pd100/CLS, in the range of P/P0 = 0.8–0.99, a sharp increase of accumulation
of N2 in the pores and the vacant space of Pd100/CLS becomes
apparent. This leads to the conclusion that Pd100/CLS has a large
surface area because of the aggregated Pd NPs.50,51 Pore structure (BJH) of the samples is depicted in Figure 4b, and the major peaks of CLS
and Pd100/CLS were about 2.7 and 1.2 nm, respectively. BET results
determined that surface properties of Pd100/CLS significantly increased
in comparison with initial CLS. Interaction between Pd NPs and the
surface of CLS leads to increase of mesoporous volume; consequently,
the size and pore volume of CLS increased after Pd NPs’ loading.52 The increasing surface area is probably due
to the doping effect and the formation of new pores because of the
loading Pd NPs on the CLS surface,50 and
this enhancement of surface area and pore volume offers a good opportunity
to adsorb and store hydrogen.

The different magnification of SEM analyses for CLS nanocomposites
are shown in Figure 5a,b, depicting that CLS has a ravinelike morphology with disparate
porosity. It is envisaged that such a structure provides ideal space
for attaching nanoparticles. The SEM images for Pd100/CLS (Figure 5c,d) confirmed the
presence of Pd NPs on the CLS surface; Pd NPs appeared aggregated
and did not show the regular morphology.

magnification levels for CLS (a, b) and
Pd100/CLS (c, d).

To scrutinize the present
Pd NPs on the CLS surface, TEM analysis
was performed for Pd100/CLS (Figure 6). Light gray thin films are CLS nanosheets interconnected
in a disorderly arrangement, as corroborated by another report.53 Spherical-type structures were formed in some
regions, indicating that Pd NPs aggregated with each other, the space
between Pd NPs and CLS surface being the generated porosity. The average
diameter of Pd NPs is estimated, with Image J software, to be about
8 nm. These results are in acceptable agreement with the BET and SEM
analysis.

Cyclic Voltammetry Studies
To comprehend the electrochemical
conduction of samples, CV study was performed in a three-electrode
cell filled with 1 M KOH at a sweep rate of 50 mV s–1 using a stainless-steel mesh substrate deposited with CLS and Pd100/CLS. Figure 9a shows CV curves
of the mesh substrate (curve I) and CLS electrode (curve II). According
to the CV curves, the results suggest that the mesh substrate has
no evident peaks in this potential window; i.e., it does not adsorb
and desorb hydrogen. Throughout Figure 9, the CV curve of CLS shows minor faradic peaks, which
means that the CLS can adsorb and desorb a little hydrogen. To take
into account Pd NPs’ performance in adsorbing and desorbing
hydrogen, the CV curve of Pd15-100/CLS is presented in Figure 9. As apparent, all curves show
oxidation and reduction peaks, demonstrating that hydrogen was adsorbed
and desorbed on the surface of the working electrodes. In the cathodic
direction, in the scan to negative potential, the CV curve of Pd15-100/CLS
shows a reduction peak (C) due to water decomposition, H formation,
and adsorption at the electrode surface.44 In contrast, in the anodic direction, an oxidation peak (A) shows
hydrogen desorbing on the surface of Pd15-100/CLS electrode, due to
the faradic reaction. The reduction peak is associated with hydrogen
adsorption on the Pd surface.12 The produced
hydrogen was adsorbed and stored on the surface of the working electrode
due to the polarization created by the applied potential. These potential
peaks, in the cathodic and anodic process, show a quasireversible
electrochemical reaction appearing on the Pdx/CLS
electrodes. To assess the influence of Pd NPs in hydrogen adsorption/desorption,
the oxidation and reduction peak currents, i.e., IA and IC, are compared and
listed in Table 3.
The immobilization Pd NPs on CLS has a meaningful effect on the oxidation
and reduction peaks, thus emphasizing that Pd is an effective catalyst
for hydrogen adsorption and desorption.

peaks, respectively.

Cyclic Life Performance
The amount of hydrogen desorbed
can be measured by the integration of the anodic peak. The total charge
related to hydrogen desorption can be associated with the integral
of the curve where atoms are being desorbed.54 Given that the electrode/electrolyte interface act as a capacitor,
the measurement of QH is done by assuming
a baseline to separate the double layer and faradic region. This part
of the CV curve, pertaining to Pd100/CLS, is presented in Figure 10a. The red area
corresponds to the double-layer capacitance, and the white area shows
the amount of hydrogen desorption. The integration is defined by following
equation 5  where ϑ is the sweep rate, dE is the potential
window, and Ia and Idl are the current due to the anodic
peak and double-layer charging, respectively.

Figure 10 (a) First cycle of Pd100/CLS
electrode in a 1 M KOH solution at
the sweep rate of 50 mV s–1 and (b) cyclic life
performance of Pd100/CLS.

To investigate the cyclic life performance of Pd100/CLS, a CV curve
for 100 cycles was obtained. By using eq 4 and CV data, QH was estimated
and drawn as a function of the cycle’s number in Figure 10b. As the curve
shows, the amount of hydrogen charge decays with the increase in the
cycle number. In the first 20 cycles, a 43% decrease in QH is probably due to the oxidation of the electrode; QH decrease during scans maybe due to the separation
of Pd100/CLS from the electrode surface.

Catalytic Studies of Pdx/CLS Nanocomposites
for Reduction of Environmental Pollutants
In this work, Cr(VI),
MB, and 4-NP were subjected to the reduction/degradation process using
Pdx/CLS nanocomposite as a sustainable and recoverable
catalytic nanosystem and HCOOH or NaBH4 as reducing agents
in aqueous media. The reduction is important and the main chemical
reaction in industrial organic chemistry, which is performed via an
electron-transfer change.17,18 The progress of the
conversion processes was checked via UV–vis analysis; Cr(VI),
4-NP, and MB have a typical absorption peak at 350, 317, and 664 nm,
respectively.

Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) was examined by deploying
HCOOH and K2Cr2O7 as a hydrogen donor
and chromium source, respectively, in the presence of Pd15/CLS and
Pd100/CLS nanocomposites at 50 °C. The mechanism of Cr(VI) reduction
by Pdx/CLS nanocomposite was studied using hydrogen
transfer of HCOOH and electron transfer between oxygen as a ligand
to Cr(VI) metal in solution (Scheme 1). HCOOH was first decomposed to hydrogen and carbon
dioxide after adsorption onto nanocomposite surface; Cr2O72– was then converted to Cr(III) by
the formation of bubbling H2 gas (eqs 1 and 2, Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Mechanism for the
Cr(VI) Reduction to Cr(III) by Pdx/CLS Nanocomposite
After the addition of HCOOH and beginning of
the Cr(VI) reduction,
the peak at 350 nm completely vanished within 2 min (Figure 11), with the disappearance
of the yellow color. Without the addition of Pdx/CLS
nanocomposites and formic acid, the reduction of Cr(VI) did not occur
and no color change was discernable even after 3 h (Table 4, entries 1 and 6). As shown
in Table 1, in the
presence of the CLS, the reduction of Cr(VI) was not completed even
after 1 h (Table 1,
entry 2). The CLS serves as a support and stabilizing agent and decreases
the agglomeration of Pd NPs, providing a synergistic effect in the
reduction process. The best results were attained using 5.0 mg of
Pd100/CLS and 1.0 mL of aqueous HCOOH solution at 50 °C within
120 s (158 s) (Table 4, entries 4 and 7).

Additionally,
the catalytic prowess of Pd15/CLS and Pd100/CLS nanocomposites
was studied toward 4-NP reduction to 4-AP; the mechanism for this
process by Pdx/CLS nanocomposites, via an electron-transfer
reaction using NaBH4 at ambient temperature, is depicted
in Scheme 2. The reduction
process can be performed by the adsorption of the BH4– and 4-NP ions on the Pdx/CLS surface
and the transfer of active hydrogen species via the π–π
stacking interactions; the reduction process can be catalyzed using
Pd NPs along with the formation of a metal hydride complex. As shown
in Scheme 2, the formed
4-AP was finally desorbed from the Pdx/CLS surface
and another catalytic cycle can start anew.

Scheme 2 4-NP Reduction Mechanism
Using Pdx/CLS Nanocomposite
During the reduction reaction, the electron transfers between BH4– ions (reductant) and Pd NPs (oxidant)
can result in the disappearance of a chiastic SPR at λmax ∼317 nm and appearance of a new SPR at 297 nm (Figure 12). Upon the addition
of Pdx/CLS nanocomposites to the reaction solution
and start of the reduction reaction, the peak intensity at 317 nm
quickly shifted to 400 nm and decreased with the concomitant disappearance
of the yellow color within 60 s at ambient temperature. The peak observed
at λmax ∼400 nm was associated with the produced
4-nitrophenolate ions following the addition of NaBH4 to
4-NP solution, disappearing after the 4-NP reduction. The reduction
process was examined with time variation using various amounts and
conditions, and results are summarized in Table 5. In the absence of the Pdx/CLS nanocomposites and NaBH4 reductant, no reaction and
obvious color change was observed (Table 5, entries 1 and 6). The catalytic performance
of the Pd15/CLS and Pd100/CLS nanocomposites became apparent in the
reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP (Table 5, entries 3–12); the Pd15/CLS and Pd100/CLS
nanocomposites are much more reactive than CLS (Table 5, entry 2). Additionally, CLS, as a support,
prevents the aggregation of Pd NPs. In addition, the catalytic activity
of the Pd100/CLS nanocomposite is better than Pd15/CLS in a comparatively
shorter time period. As shown, the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP was quickly
completed within 60 s using 7.0 mg of Pd100/CLS nanocomposite as a
highly active nanocatalyst and 100 equiv of NaBH4 (Table 5, entry 12). Additionally,
the reaction time for the reduction reaction increased to 83 and 75
s in the presence of 50 or/and 79 equiv of the NaBH4 solution,
respectively (Table 5, entries 10 and 11).

For the other pollutant, MB,
a similar method was repeated to assess
the catalytic ability of the Pdx/CLS nanocomposites
and the results are reported in Table 6; generally, Pdx/CLS nanocomposites
could reduce MB solution in a short span of time. The investigation
of the MB reduction was performed by recording the process of the
UV absorption spectra at λmax ∼664 nm (Figure 13). According to
the obtained results, no color change was observed without assistance
of Pdx/CLS nanocomposites and NaBH4 reductant
even after 60 min (Table 6, entries 1 and 4). The obtained results (Table 6) depict that the Pd15/CLS has
weaker performance for the MB reduction, and a relatively slower reaction
rate was observed in comparison with Pd100/CLS. The best activity
for the MB reduction was obtained using 3.0 mg of Pd100/CLS nanocomposite;
further increments of its amount did not improve the results (Table 6, entries 5 and 6).
Since both, the adsorption of reactants and electron-transfer process
from the BH4– to MB take place on the
Pd surface, the Pd100/CLS nanocomposite is much more reactive than
CLS. CLS, as a support, prevents the aggregation of Pd NPs, and its
synergic effect is important in the reduction process.

Catalyst Recyclability
The Pd100/CLS nanocomposite
revealed excellent reusability and recyclability for catalyzing the
4-NP reduction using NaBH4 under equivalent empirical conditions.
The easy separation of the synthesized Pdx/CLS allows
it to be collected and removed from the reaction mixture via simple
filtration. After carrying out the reduction process, the used nanocatalyst
can be collected, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and then
dried for the consecutive cycle. Figure 14 depicts that Pd100/CLS catalyzed the reduction
of 4-NP with declined product yield of only 3% after eight consecutive
runs.

Conclusions
Commercial
lignosulfonate (CLS) was modified by means of Pd NPs
to accomplish hydrogen storage in alkaline medium, and the same catalyst
was equally efficient for the environmental cleanup of common pollutants
in aqueous medium. Characterization techniques, viz., XRD, FT-IR,
BET/BJH, SEM, EDS, and TEM, were deployed to study the surface of
the representative samples. The results show that the LAL process
managed to fabricate Pd NPs and their subsequent deposition procedure
on CLS was successful. The electrochemical study has shown an encouraging
hydrogen storage capacity due to the loading of Pd NPs, which was
about 5.8 C g–1; Pd NPs serve as active sites for
the hydrogen adsorption. The present study also illustrates that Pdx/CLS nanocomposites have exceptional catalytic activity
and stability for the reduction of common environmental pollutants
in water, namely, 4-NP and MB with NaBH4 and Cr(VI) with
HCOOH.

Experimental Section
Instruments and Reagents
Commercial
calcium lignosulfonate
(CLS) with an ideal formula was used. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns
were applied to characterize the structure of samples (XRD, Unisantis
xmd300 model), the wavelength of 1.5405 Å, and the 2θ range
10–80°. A UV–vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi, U-2900,
λ = 200–700 nm) was employed to record the reduction
of MB, 4-NP, and Cr(VI). A scanning electron microscope (Cam scan
MV2300), equipped by an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS),
was used to determine the morphologies and the elemental analysis
of nanocomposites and electrodes, respectively. To measure the chemical
environment of samples, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, Thermo
Nicolet) spectra were acquired. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET, BELSORP-mini II) and Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
analysis were deployed to study pore size and surface morphology of
samples. The presence of Pd NPs on CLS was visualized using a transmission
electron microscope (Zeiss-EM10C-100 kV). In addition, cyclic voltammetry
was deployed to determine the electrochemical characteristics of the
samples.

Synthesis of Pd-Loaded CLS
To produce colloidal Pd
NPs, a bulk piece of palladium was ultrasonically cleaned in distilled
water and acetone. The Pd target (99.9%, Aldrich) is positioned at
the cell bottom filled with deionized water. The ablation process
was carried out according to our earlier described procedure.42 As the LAL process was performed, the color
of deionized water turned black, affirming the presence of Pd NPs
in deionized water. To prevent the agglomeration and reduce the rate
of production for Pd NPs due to absorption laser beam by NPs, the
LAL process was carried out in 3, 6, and 20 stages, each stage being
of 5 min for Pd15/CLS, Pd30/CLS, and Pd100/CLS, respectively. In each
stage, 5 mL of deionized water was used in a way that about 2 mm water
covers the whole target surface. After 5 min, the colloidal Pd NPs
were extracted, and the LAL process, repeated with fresh deionized
water. Finally, LAL was performed for different time periods: 15,
30, and 100 min. After the LAL process, CLS was added to the Pd NP
colloidal solution and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 24 h at
room temperature. Finally, the ensuing nanocomposite was filtered
and dried at ambient temperature in a dust-free atmosphere. According
to LAL time, the nanocomposites were labeled Pdx/CLS,
where x represents the ablation time (x = 15, 30, and 100 min). The schematic of the whole procedure is
depicted in Figure 1a.

Electrode Preparation
CLS and Pdx/CLS
were used to create the electrodes: about 2 mg of the samples was
added into deionized water (3 mL) and sonicated for 15 min. A stainless-steel
mesh (200 mesh, 0.36 cm2) was used as the substrate, which
was washed by acetone and deionized water, respectively. Then, the
electrodes were prepared by the drop casting method on the substrate
and dried at room temperature (Figure 1b).

Electrochemical Instrumentation
All electrochemical
measurements were made at ambient temperature by an autolab (PSTAT204)
using a three-electrode cell composed of a working electrode, a reference
electrode (Ag/AgCl), and a counter electrode (Pt plate). The KOH electrolyte
was prepared at 1 M concentration. For minimizing the ohmic drop of
electrolyte, reference electrode was placed close to the surface of
the working electrode. CV measurements of the working electrodes were
carried out in a potential range of −1.3 to 0 V with a scanning
rate of 50 mV s–1.

General Procedure for the
Reduction of Cr(VI)
To assess
the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), an aqueous K2Cr2O7 solution (3.4 × 10–3 M,
25 mL) was first mixed with Pdx/CLS nanocomposite
(5.0 mg) and then a HCO2H solution (1.0 mL, 88%) was added
at 50 °C under constant stirring. UV–vis analysis was
employed to monitor the process; the Cr(VI) aqueous solution has an
absorption peak at 350 nm. After fading of the solution color (light
yellow), the Pdx/CLS nanocomposite was removed, washed
with EtOH and deionized H2O, and utilized again in sequential
cycles.

4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) Reduction
The efficacy of the
Pdx/CLS nanocomposite was also evaluated in the 4-NP
reduction to 4-AP using NaBH4. In this experiment, 7.0
mg of Pdx/CLS were dispersed into aqueous 4-NP solution
(2.5 mM, 25 mL) and then freshly prepared NaBH4 solution
(25 mL, 250 mM) was added under stirring at room temperature. The
yellow color of the solution disappeared and it became colorless,
indicating the completion of reduction. After affirming the end of
the reduction process by UV–vis spectroscopy, Pdx/CLS was filtered off, washed with deionized H2O, dried,
and then reused for subsequent runs.

Methylene Blue (MB) Reduction
In this investigation,
Pdx/CLS nanocomposite (3.0 mg) and aqueous MB solution
(25 mL, 3.1 × 10–5 M) were shaken under stirring
at room temperature for 60 s. A freshly prepared aqueous NaBH4 solution (25 mL, 5.3 × 10–3 M) was
quickly added to the mixture and was allowed to stir at room temperature
while the above solution rapidly became colorless. At the end, the
nanocomposite was similarly separated, washed, dried, and utilized
in the following cycles with no significant changes in the catalytic
activity.
