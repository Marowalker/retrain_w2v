A combination
of structure-based drug design and medicinal chemistry
efforts led us from benzimidazole-2-carboxamide with modestly active
hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 2 inhibition to certain
benzimidazole-2-pyrazole carboxylic acids that were more potent as
well as orally efficacious stimulators of erythropoietin secretion
in our in vivo mouse model. To better understand the structure–activity
relationship, it was necessary to account for (i) the complexation
of the ligand with the active site Fe2+, (ii) the strain
incurred by the ligand upon binding, and (iii) certain key water interactions
identified by a crystal structure analysis. With this more complete computational
model, we arrived at an overarching paradigm that accounted for the
potency differences between benzimidazole-2-carboxamide and benzimidazole-2-pyrazole
carboxylic acid enzyme inhibitors. Moreover, the computational paradigm
allowed us to anticipate that the bioisostere replacement strategy
(amide → pyrazole), which had shown success in the benzimidazole
series, was not generally applicable to other series. This illustrates
that to fully reconcile the important ligand–active site interactions
for certain targets, one often needs to move beyond traditional structure-based
drug design (such as crystallographic analysis, docking, etc.) and
appeal to a higher level of computational theory.

Introduction
The hypoxia-inducible
factor prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes
(HIF-PHD) are a family of highly conserved, iron-containing enzymes
that play a critical role in adaptation and survival during oxygen-deficient
conditions,1−3 with the prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2) isoform being
of particular interest in drug discovery since it holds promise for
the treatment of anemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and metabolic
disorders through inhibition of degradation of the HIF transcription
factors.4

A combination of virtual
screening, structure-based drug design,
and medicinal chemistry efforts led to certain benzimidazole-2-carboxamide
compounds, which showed modest enzyme inhibition5 (e.g., 1, pIC50 = 4.9) and generally
failed to significantly stimulate erythropoietin (EPO) release (a
major transcriptional factor for HIF) from Hep3B cells at concentrations
up to 100 μM. Indeed, overall optimization of the in vitro potency
of the benzimidazole-2-carboxamide series proved challenging.

A bioisostere replacement6 effort eventually
led to the benzimidazole-2-pyrazole carboxylic acid series, which
were significantly more potent compared to benzimidazole-2-carboxamide
with several compounds having pIC50 ≥ 7.0. Moreover,
many of these compounds increased both HIF-1α accumulation and
EPO release in Hep3B cells in vitro,7 and
some produced an increase in EPO when orally dosed in vivo (mouse
model).8

Despite these successes,
we desired to have a clearer understanding
of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the dramatic potency
improvement upon bioisosteric replacement of the amide with pyrazole
and whether this was indicative of a general strategy for all amide-based
PHD2 enzyme inhibitors.

By systematically refining the computational
model and level of
theory, we were able to account for this improvement in enzyme potency
and lay the foundation for a more general binding hypothesis.

Results
and Discussion
Active Site Interactions of the Benzimidazole
Series
To better understand the ligand–active site
interactions,
we obtained a crystal structure of 5,6-dichloro-benzimidazole-2-carboxamide
(1) complexed with PHD2 (PDB ID: 3OUI). Although 1 is the most potent compound from this series, its pIC50 was still a modest value of 4.9. Figure 1 depicts the key interactions of 1: (i) a salt bridge with R383 via the acid moiety, (ii) a bridging
water interaction with Y303 via the NH of benzimidazole, and (iii)
a bidentate interaction with Fe2+ via the nitrogen atom
of benzimidazole and oxygen atom of the amide.

Figure 1 Crystal structure of 1 in the active site of PHD2
(PDB ID: 3OUI). In addition to the bidentate interaction with Fe2+, the other key interactions are shown as dashed lines.

Despite being the more potent
series, members of the benzimidazole-2-pyrazole
carboxylic acid series also revealed the same key interactions as 1 (e.g., 2c in Figure 3) upon obtaining the crystal structures.

Thus, while the crystallography information provided valuable insight
into the important interactions occurring in the benzimidazole series,
neither it nor the subsequent docking analysis reconciled the two-log
unit difference in pIC50, which resulted from replacing
the amide motif with the pyrazole bioisostere. To better understand
this, it was clear that a computational model that evolved past the
usual structure-based approaches of docking and crystallographic analyses
would be necessary. Any learning could then potentially be utilized
to identify a new chemical series with increased potency.

While
docking captures the general shape of the active site and
key interactions at a force-field level of theory, we anticipated
that several important binding characteristics would be missed. In
particular, the Fe2+–ligand interaction is not captured
at a high level of theory. Moreover, both docking and crystallography
results of 1 and 2 revealed that a near-planar
binding pose was necessary to facilitate the bidentate complexation
of Fe2+, whereas our initial computational analysis of
the unbound ligand (gas phase) revealed a nonplanar conformation;
this implied that a strain penalty upon binding would be incurred,
which warranted a more detailed computational analysis. Finally, we
felt that the bridging water interaction and its contribution to the
overall potency also necessitated further investigation.

Complexation
and Strain
To more thoroughly interrogate
our system, we supplemented our initial analyses with quantum calculations
using Jaguar (under Maestro Version 10.7.015, release 2016-3)9 with density functional theory (B3LYP) and the
LACV3P* basis set. Further, symmetry was turned off, the grid density
was set to “fine”, and the accuracy level was set to
“accurate”. At this level of theory, we anticipated
that we would gain deeper insight into the Fe2+–ligand
complexation and binding strain. We initially explored a model system
that would represent the key residues involved in complexation (H313,
D315, and H374), Fe2+, the complexing water (known from
crystallography), and the ligand. Here, the histidine residues were
approximated as imidazoles and the aspartate residue as acetate. To
further refine the model and since it was common to both benzimidazole
analogs, we ignored the carboxylic acid of the ligands. This had the
added benefit of simplifying our calculations by eliminating the need
for diffuse functions (which can cause convergence issues).

Using this initial model system, we found that the total energy for
both Fe2+ complexation and strain was lower (more favorable)
for the pyrazole motif, and therefore, it was consistent with the
empirical results. As our goal was to find the simplest model system
that agreed with experiment, we pursued further simplification by
including only Fe2+ and the ligand (without the carboxylic
acid; see above). The total energy (Fe2+ complexation and
strain) calculated with this simpler model system still favored the
pyrazole motif. This became the model system for subsequent investigations
and will be the basis of the results reported herein.

Figure 2 shows the
results of the calculations on both benzimidazole analogs (1 and 2). The pyrazole motif (i.e., 2) has
stronger Fe2+ complexation (by 1.78 kcal/mol) and a lower
strain penalty (by 1.41 kcal/mol), which results in it being favored
overall by 3.19 kcal/mol. The higher strain for the amide motif of 1 can be understood in terms of the bound-state conformation
needing to be nearly planar for the portions of the molecule (e.g.,
benzimidazole and amide) that complex Fe2+, which results
in an unfavorable dipole–dipole interaction between the NH
groups of benzimidazole and the amide bond. Indeed, a similar disfavored
interaction occurs for the pyrazole motif. However, it is to a lesser
extent since the dipole–dipole interaction is now between the
NH of benzimidazole and the CH of pyrazole.

Figure 2 Calculation scheme for 1 and 2. ΔΔEcomplex is the difference in Fe2+ complexation energies,
while ΔΔEstrain is the difference
in strain energies between the two
analogs. In both cases, the energy differences favor the pyrazole
motif for a total of 3.19 kcal/mol. The key portion of the tail motif
is highlighted in blue; the remaining acid portion of the tail motif
is highlighted in red and (as noted in the text) was not explicitly
included as part of the model system. The arrows indicate the strain
between adjacent regions.

Having satisfactorily reconciled the nature of the potency
difference
between compounds 1 and 2, we then focused
the structure–activity relationship (SAR) development around
the more potent benzimidazole-2-pyrazole carboxylic acid series.

Fe2+ Complexation Energy Calculations
Three
separate minimizations are performed to obtain ΔEcomplex: (i) minimization of the Fe2+–molecule
complex, (ii) minimization of Fe2+, and (iii) minimization
of the (fully unconstrained) molecule. To obtain the ΔEcomplex (of formation) for a given complex,
the final energies of Fe2+ and the molecule are subtracted
from the final energy of the Fe2+–molecule complex.
To obtain the ΔΔEcomplex of
two different complexes, the ΔEcomplex of the lower energy complex is subtracted from the ΔEcomplex of the higher energy complex. By this
definition, the ΔΔEcomplex is a positive value that indicates how much lower in energy the
lower energy complex is versus the higher energy complex. All minimizations
were performed using Jaguar (under Maestro Version 10.7.015, release
2016-3) with density functional theory (B3LYP) and the LACV3P* basis
set. Further, symmetry was turned off, the grid density was set to
“fine”, and the accuracy level was set to “accurate”.
We note that to find the lowest energy state for a given species,
it may be necessary to slightly vary the input conformation/geometry
and to perform multiple minimizations. (For example, even for the
Fe2+–molecule complex minimizations, we would vary
the position of the molecule relative to Fe2+ and perform
multiple minimizations.) We then deemed the final energy as the lowest
energy value that converged.

Strain Energy Calculations
The molecule
conformation
obtained from the minimization of the Fe2+–molecule
complex is extracted. The dihedral angle of the molecule is constrained
to its original value, and a subsequent minimization is performed
on the molecule alone. A fully unconstrained minimization of the molecule
is also performed. To obtain the ΔEstrain of a given molecule, the final energy of the unconstrained (lower
energy) conformation is subtracted from the final energy of the constrained
(higher energy) conformation. By this definition, the sign of ΔEstrain is positive. To obtain the ΔΔEstrain of two different molecules, the ΔEstrain of the lower strained molecule is subtracted
from the ΔEstrain of the higher
strained molecule. By this definition, the ΔΔEstrain is a positive value that indicates how much lower
in strain the lower strained molecule is versus the higher strained
molecule. All minimizations were performed using Jaguar (under Maestro
Version 10.7.015, release 2016-3) with density functional theory (B3LYP)
and the LACV3P* basis set. Symmetry was turned off, the grid density
was set to “fine”, and the accuracy level was set to
“accurate”. We note that to find the lowest energy state
for a given molecule, it may be necessary to slightly vary the input
conformation and to perform multiple minimizations. (Indeed, even
for the dihedral-constrained molecule minimizations, we would slightly
displace the dihedral from its starting value, upon which it obtained
the desired constrained value upon completion of the minimization.)
We then deemed the final energy as the lowest energy value that converged.

Substitution Effects on Fe2+ Complexation and the
Preferred Tautomer
The effect of 5,6-disubstitution of the
benzimidazole ring on the Fe2+ complexation energy for
the benzimidazole-2-pyrazole carboxylic acid series was investigated.
For all analogs of interest, the Fe2+ complexation for
each of the two orientations was calculated.

Table 1 shows the lower energy orientation
(with respect to Fe2+) for several 5,6-disubstituted analogs
along with the energy difference between the two orientations (the
negative sign indicates that the orientation shown is preferred according
to the model). An interesting trend emerges: the more electronegative
substituent of the two faces Fe2+. Moreover, these calculations
reveal which benzimidazole nitrogen interacts with Fe2+ and, in turn, which nitrogen bonds with hydrogen; as such, we have
deemed the resulting energy difference the preferred tautomer energy
(ΔEtautomer).

a The expected (from
the ΔEtautomer) binding orientation
with respect to
Fe2+ is shown. Highlighted in blue is the pKa proton. The acid group is highlighted in red to remind
the reader that this motif was removed to further simplify all calculations.

Compared to docking alone,
this calculation provided important
information that allowed the determination of binding poses with greater
certainty. For example, in Figure 3, we see the crystal structure
of 2c, which is in excellent agreement with the binding
pose that was predicted (prior to obtaining the crystal structure)
using the combination of docking and Fe2+ complexation
energy calculations. In general, with respect to its interaction with
Fe2+ and other key interactions (shown as dashed lines),
this binding pose is representative of the benzimidazole-2-pyrazole
carboxylic acid series. Further, as seen in Figure 1, these are the same interactions made by 1.

Figure 3 Crystal structure of 2c in the active site of PHD2
(PDB ID: 3OUH). In addition to the bidentate interaction with Fe2+, the other key interactions are shown as dashed lines. (Note
that the same interactions are also present in 1 as seen
in Figure 1.) The combination
of docking and Fe2+ calculations correctly predicted this
binding pose and orientation of the disubstitution prior to obtaining
the crystal structure.

The Water Model
Although our crystal structures revealed
a conserved cascade of water in the active site, we chose to focus
on the single water molecule (of this cascade) closest to the protonated
nitrogen of benzimidazole since (as noted earlier) it showed a bridging
water interaction to Y303. The first step in constructing our water
model was to determine which nitrogen of disubstituted benzimidazole
was protonated; in other words, we first calculated the preferred
tautomer as previously described.

Thereafter, Jaguar10−12 was used to calculate the pKa of this
key proton. As part of the Fe2+ complexation energy calculations,
it was necessary to optimize the Fe2+–ligand complex.
From this calculation, we took the ligand conformation alone and used
it as the starting conformation in Jaguar. (We note that Jaguar does
not currently allow one to fix the input conformation and the inclusion
of Fe2+ as part of the pKa calculation
is not recommended in general.13)

Table 1 shows the
calculated pKa (in DMSO) versus the experimental
pIC50 values. In general, as the benzimidazole proton becomes
more acidic (as the pKa decreases), the
pIC50 increases. We hypothesize that this proton is interacting
with the oxygen in the water molecule to form a hydrogen bond. Thus,
as the pKa decreases, it becomes a better
donor, which results in potency improvement. In Figure 4, the correlation between the calculated
pKa (DMSO) and pIC50 values
is plotted. The good correlation (R2 =
0.870) provided a reliable way to easily obtain potency gains.

Figure 4 The correlation
of the experimental pIC50 with the calculated
pKa (DMSO) of the key proton of the benzimidazole
series (R2 = 0.870).

The Cinnoline Series: A Prospective Model
As the project
progressed, it became desirable to find other viable analogs and move
beyond the benzimidazole-2-pyrazole carboxylic acid series. This also
afforded the opportunity for the model to make prospective predictions.

From the literature,14 4-hydroxycinnoline-3-carboxamide
was known to give good inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity,
which led us to consider its viability for PHD2. Both the carboxamide
and pyrazole carboxylic acid analogs (3 and 4, respectively) were interrogated in the modeling paradigm (docking,
Fe2+ complexation energy, ΔEtautomer, and strain).

Figure 5 displays
the results of the Fe2+ complexation energy and strain
calculations on both 4-hydroxycinnolines motifs. Unlike the benzimidazoles,
for the 4-hydroxycinnolines, it is the amide motif that has the stronger
Fe2+ complexation (by 2.13 kcal/mol) and lower strain penalty
(by 0.629 kcal/mol), which results in it being favored overall by
2.76 kcal/mol. The physical origins of the strain difference are similar
as noted for the benzimidazoles, in which the portions of the molecule
(e.g., cinnoline and pyrazole) that complex Fe2+ will be
nearly planar. Whereas for the 4-hydroxycinnoline-3-amide motif, this
results in a (favorable) intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction
between the oxygen atom of the cinnoline hydroxyl and the NH of the
amide; the pyrazole motif is unable to make such an interaction.

Figure 5 Calculation
scheme for 3 and 4. ΔΔEcomplex is the difference in Fe2+ complexation energies, while ΔΔEstrain is the difference in strain energies between the two
analogs. Unlike for the benzimidazoles, for the cinnolines, the energy
differences favor the amide motif for a total of 2.76 kcal/mol. The
key portion of the tail motif is highlighted in blue; the remaining
acid portion of the tail motif is highlighted in red and (as noted
in the text) was not included as part of the model system. The arrows
indicate the strain between regions, whereas the dashed lines indicate
a key hydrogen bond.

Both compounds were subsequently made, and as predicted by
the
model, the amide analog (3) was more potent (pIC50 = 6.9 versus 5.0 for the pyrazole analog (4)). That the pyrazole motif did not provide the potency gains seen
for the benzimidazoles is a striking reminder of a non-additive SAR.
In other words, whether the pyrazole or amide motif is preferred depends
on what it is “paired” with and whether this resulting
molecule can achieve the near-planar binding conformation necessary
to complex Fe2+ without incurring too much strain. The
ability of the model to predict this became a powerful tool in our
further design efforts.

In Figure 6, we
show the crystal structure of 3 in the active site of
PHD2. Once again, the modeling paradigm correctly predicted the binding
pose. The key interactions are like those seen before for the benzimidazole
analogs, where it makes a salt bridge with R383 via the acid moiety
and a bidentate interaction with Fe2+ via the N1 nitrogen
atom of the cinnoline and the oxygen atom of the amide. However, unlike
the benzimidazole series, which make a bridging water interaction
to Y303 via the key water molecule, the 4-hydroxyl of the cinnoline
displaces that water molecule completely and directly forms a hydrogen
bond with Y303.

Figure 6 Crystal structure of 3 in the active site
of PHD2
(PDB ID: 6NMQ). As before with 2c, the modeling paradigm
correctly predicted the binding pose prior to obtaining the crystal
structure.

Conclusions
The
modeling approaches most often used in structure-based drug
design are usually crystallographic analyses and docking. Indeed,
these approaches are paramount, but moving beyond these qualitative
approaches means systematically interrogating particular ligand interactions
at a higher level of theory. Moreover, ligand binding strain is often
a hidden culprit in ligand potency and should also be accounted for
explicitly in computational models.

In the case of PHD2, devising
computational models for the Fe2+ complexation and key
water interaction (along with the ligand
binding strain) allowed us to account for potency differences seen
within both the benzimidazole (retrospectively) and 4-hydroxyl cinnoline
(prospectively) series. Whereas the pyrazole motif was favored over
the amide in the benzimidazole series for its potency gains, the reverse
scenario was true in the 4-hydroxycinnoline series. This was a stark
reminder of the often non-additivity effect that can frustrate SAR
interpretation between different chemical series. The model’s
ability to differentiate this effect among diverse series provided
substantial guidance in future design efforts.
