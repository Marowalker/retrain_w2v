This work introduced
a facile synthesis method of reduced graphene
oxide-conjugated urchin-like NiCo2O4 nanostructures
via a simple, cost-effective, and environmental-friendly one-pot hydrothermal
method. The as-prepared rGO-NiCo2O4 nanocomposites
were used to fabricate 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-modified glassy
carbon electrode (GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4) for
ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of o-nitro
(o-NP) and p-amino (p-AP) phenols. The structure and morphology of the nanocomposite were
characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
Electrochemical experiments revealed that the nanocomposite exhibited
remarkable electrochemical performances. A linear relationship is
observed with the differential pulse voltammetry experiment between
the peak currents and the concentrations in the ranges of 5.0 ×
10–9 to 5.0 × 10–7 M (R2 = 0.996) and 1.0 × 10–6 to 2.5 × 10–5 M (R2 = 0.992) for o-NP and of 1.0 × 10–8 to 5.0 × 10–7 M (R2 = 0.996) and 1.0 × 10–6 to 1.0 × 10–4 M (R2 = 0.987) for p-AP. The calculated detection limits (S/N = 3) are 5.0
× 10–9 M and 1.0 ×10–8 M for o-NP and p-AP, respectively.
Furthermore, a very high recovery percentage is obtained with the
proposed sensor after successful application in the determination
of target analytes in tap water samples.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
last decades, the synthesis of new nanostructures of metal oxides
with attractive morphology is of high interest because of their potential
use in different fields.1,2 The development of nanostructured
materials provides propitious elucidation to enhance catalytic activity
toward electrochemical reactions because of their high surface area,
improved electron and ion transport pathways, and excellent mechanical
strength.3 Recently, ternary metal oxides
have received much attention and were found to be beneficial to electrochemical
applications because of their promising characteristics.4−6 Among them, NiCo2O4 is one of the most promising
transition metal oxides for electrochemistry on account of its high
specific surface area, low cost, and unique electronic conductivity.
Up to now, a number NiCo2O4-based nanostructures
such as Co3O4/NiCo2O4,7,8 Fe2O3@NiCo2O4,9 MnO2/NiCo2O4,10 NiCo2O4@graphene,11 and so forth have been developed and exploited
to enhance the electron transfer rate between electrodes and targets.
To date, various shape and morphologies of NiCo2O4 nanostructures have been observed including nanotubes,7 nanosheets,5 nanosphere,9 nanorods.10 However,
most NiCo2O4-based nanostructures still suffer
from some disadvantages, such as undesirably electronic conductance,
volume expansion, and instability during redox reactions, structural
fragility, agglomeration, and so forth which limit their application
in practical devices.8−10 Therefore, further explorations are still needed
to overcome the abovementioned problems.

Several researchers
combined conductive materials like graphene
into the NiCo2O4 moiety as the composite and
reported an improved electrochemical performance.8−10 Compared with
other carbon materials, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/nanoparticle
composites have attracted increasing attention for electrochemical
applications in terms of conductivity, inner architecture, superior
electrochemical stability, and dispersibility.12,13 Therefore, it seems interesting to develop rGO-conjugated NiCo2O4 nanostructure with superior performance in practical
applications.

Phenols and substituted phenolic compounds have
been included in
environmental legislations because of their existence in normal water
and effluents from a broad range of human performances.14 These phenolic derivatives have the potential
to provoke mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in a grade that is considered
to be priority toxic pollutants by European Union and Environmental
Protection Agency.15 2-Nitrophenol (o-NP) and 4-aminophenol (p-AP) are amongst
the highly hazardous and toxic phenols which are extensively used
in industrial production of pesticides, dyes, and pharmaceuticals.16 These two compounds are well known and widely
studied because of their toxicity and serious impact on the metabolic
activities and growth of the organism.17,18

Therefore,
it is highly desirable to develop an efficient, sensitive,
and selective device for phenolic compound detection for environmental
monitoring and diagnostic research. Till date, many analytical methods
are routinely utilized for the determination of phenol derivatives
such as high-performance liquid chromatography,19 fluorescence spectroscopies,20 liquid chromatography,21 capillary electrophoresis,22 and electrochemical sensors.23−27 Among all these techniques, electrochemical methods
have received more considerable attention because of low-cost, simple
operation, fast response, and higher sensitivity. However, because
of their very low concentration existence in real samples and too
close peak potentials with similar electroactive isomers, it is still
a challenge to develop highly selective and sensitive electrochemical
sensors.

Herein, we synthesized rGO-conjugated NiCo2O4 nanostructures and deposited onto the silane modified
glassy carbon
electrode. The surface physiochemical properties of the resulted materials
were characterized by different microscopic and spectroscopic methods.
The electrochemical behavior of two phenolic compounds at the modified
electrode is investigated and their electrochemical reaction mechanism
is also discussed. The proposed method was further applied to determine
trace amounts of target analytes in real water samples.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Reagents
All chemicals
used in this
experiment were of analytical grade and used as received unless otherwise
specified. 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), NiCl2·6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O, l-ascorbic
acid were purchased from Aladdins Reagent, Shanghai, China. Modified
Hummers’ method was used to synthesize graphene oxide nanosheets,
and it was kindly supplied by Yuta, Japan, the preparation method
of which was described in the previous report.13 During electrochemical experiments, all the analyte solutions
were prepared in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.0). KCl (0.1 mol L–1) containing 5.0 mmol L–1 Fe (CN)63– and 5.0 mmol L–1 Fe (CN)64– was used as redox probe solution. Throughout
the experiments, deionized water of 18.2 MΩ was used.

2.2 Synthesis of rGO-NiCo2O4 Nanostructures
At first, freshly prepared GO was uniformly
dispersed in water by ultrasonication (30 mL, 1 mg mL–1) for 1 h. Then, the resultant solution was mixed with 200 mg of
NiCl2·6H2O, 200 mg of CoCl2·6H2O (1:1 molar ratio), and 30 mg of ascorbic acid under vigorous
stirring and ultrasonication for 30 min each. Subsequently, the resulting
suspension was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and
heated to 150 °C for 24 h. As the autoclave cooled down to room
temperature, the precipitate was cleaned with deionized water and
ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The urchin-like
rGO-conjugated NiCo2O4 nanocomposites were thus
obtained and referred to as rGO- NiCo2O4. Other
nanocomposites were also prepared by the same procedure in the absence
of either Ni, Co, or rGO and used as reference materials.

2.3 Fabrication of GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4
Typically, GCE (3 mm diameter) was polished
consecutively by using 0.05 μm alumina powder and subsequently
cleaned ultrasonically with nitric acid/water (1:1), ethanol, and
deionized water and finally rinsed with ultra-pure water and dried
under N2. The polished GCE was then dipped in 1% KOH solution
for 5 min to generate hydroxyl groups on their surface. Soon after,
GCE was immersed in 1% APTES anhydrous ethanol solution for 1.5 h
at 70 °C to form a self-assembled monolayer of APTES. The functionalized
alkylsilane was usually used to prepare amine-functionalized monolayers
on the electrode surface. As we have reported earlier, the negatively
charged NH2-terminated monolayer created through the protonation
of the amino group on the electrode surface is very effective to attach
with graphene.12 Finally, 10 μL of
rGO-NiCo2O4 solution (0.1 mg/mL dispersed in
deionized water under ultrasonic agitation to form a suspension) was
dropped onto the APTES-modified GCE and kept for 30 min, and then
washed with deionized water and dried with N2 to obtain
the GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4-modified electrode.

2.4 Apparatus
CHI electrochemical workstation
(Shanghai CH Instruments) with a conventional three electrode system
was used for electrochemical measurements. GCE with a surface area
of 3 mm was used as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter
electrode, and the Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The
morphology of nanomaterials was characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G2 20, USA) and Hitachi S-3000H model scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) instruments. X-ray diffractometer (Bruker
D8 ADVANCE, Germany) was used to study the crystallographic information
of samples, while Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (12 Nicolet
170, USA) was used to obtain infrared spectra. Impedance analyzer
EIM6ex ZAHNER (Kroanch, Germany) was used to study electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (ESI).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Structural and Morphology
Analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the phase
structure of
the as-synthesized samples and is shown in Figure 1a. The observed major diffraction peaks at
65.2, 59.3, 44.8, 36.5, 31.2, and 19.0° corresponded to (440),
(511), (400), (311), (220), and (111) reflection planes, respectively.
All the diffraction peaks were in absolute agreement with face-centered
cubic-structured NiCo2O4 with a space group
of Fd3m (JCPDS no. 73-1702; red
line). The diffraction peak at 24.9° corresponding to the (002)
reflection plane is due to the GO reduction in the presence of ascorbic
acid, which is an agreement with our previous report. No other impurity
peaks were observed, indicating the pure phase of NiCo2O4. Figure 1b is the Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectra of the as-prepared
samples, in which the broad peaks centering at 3500 and 1630 cm–1 verifies the presence of a hydroxyl group and are
attributed to the stretching of carboxyl (−COOH and/or H2O).28 The absorption peaks appeared
at 1177, 1378, 567, and 1630 support the presence of epoxy C–O,
C–OH, C=O, and O–H bond stretching in GO. After
complete reduction, those peak intensities are decreased with a new
peak at ∼1548 cm–1 that is observed for rGO.29 In the spectrum of rGO-NiCo2O4 nanocomposites, the two bands at around 571 and 654 cm–1 along with the other bands at lower frequencies can
be assigned to the stretching vibrations of the Ni–O and Co–O
bonds.29

The morphologies and structural
features of as-synthesized rGO-Co3O4, rGO-Ni,
and rGO-NiCo2O4 nanostructures with different
magnifications were elucidated by
SEM and TEM measurements. Figure 2a represents the uniformly spheroidal morphology of
the pure Co3O4 nanoball with a diameter of about
100–300 nm wrapped with the rGO nanosheet. The SEM image in Figure 2b shows Ni nanowire
with an average diameter size of ca. 7 nm conjugated with rGO. Figure 2c,d displays the
as-synthesized urchin-like NiCo2O4 nanostructures
with an average diameter of about 0.7 μm. The SEM image of an
individual urchin-like NiCo2O4 nanostructure
(Figure 2d) shows that
numerous Ni nanowires with very high density grow pointing toward
the center of the Co3O4 nanosphere. Based on
the above observations, a “nanosphere/nanowire to-urchin structure”
transformation mechanism is presented in Figure 2f to explain the growth of urchin-like NiCo2O4 nanostructures. The observed 3D framework is
beneficial for providing efficient electron transport and developing
electronic conductivity which leads to improved electrochemical performance.30 The EDX elemental mapping from the region of Figure 2e of the SEM image
reveals a uniform distribution of NiCo2O4 nanostructures
conjugated with rGO nanosheets via a strong coupling interaction between
the GO and metal nanosphere.

high density, the rGO-NiCo2O4 nanostructures
grow pointing toward the center of the Co3O4 nanoball to urchin-like spheres.

To confirm the architectural structure of the as-made rGO-NiCo2O4 nanostructures and to have an insight into the
morphology, TEM and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) were done and presented
in Figure 3. The uniform
distribution of Ni nanowire on the graphene surface is shown by the
low-magnification image (Figure 3a). The length of the nanowires is ∼250 nm,
with a diameter of ∼7 nm. The TEM image of a single NiCo2O4 nanostructure (Figure 3c) reveals urchin-like spherical structures
which size and shape very much consistent with SEM observations. The
clear image of rGO nanosheets is distinctly observed all over the
surface film. The HR-TEM images (Figure 3e,f) show lattice fringes with an interplanar
spacing of 0.20 and 0.24 nm, corresponding to that of the (400) and
(311) lattice planes of the NiCo2O4 nanostructure,
respectively. The resultant unique urchin-like 3D nanostructure is
assumed to facilitate electron transport during electrochemical reactions.

3.2 Electrochemical Performance of GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4
The electrochemical performance of
the rGO-NiCo2O4 nanocomposite-modified GCE is
performed via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and EIS in 0.1 M L–1 KCl including 5.0 mM L–1 Fe(CN)63–/4– shown in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4a, a pair of well-defined redox peaks corresponding
to Fe(CN)63–/4– appeared for both
bare and modified GCE. For the bare GCE, the peak to the peak separation
(ΔEp) value is calculated as 209
mV, which indicates the occurrence of a slow electron-transfer kinetics
at the surface. On the other hand, the redox peak currents obviously
increased (ΔEp = 78 mV) for rGO-modified
GCE (GCE/APTES/rGO), suggesting fastest electron-transfer kinetics
and largest electroactive surface. While after rGO-NiCo2O4 deposition (GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4), the ΔEp value is 88 mV, which
is slightly lower than GCE/APTES/rGO but much higher than bare GCE.
It can be ascribed that the facilitated fast electron transfer due
to the conjugation of conductive graphene sheets and NiCo2O4 nanostructures results synergetic signal amplification.

and 100 mV/s) (c) and the corresponding calibration plots between
different scan rate versus anodic and cathodic peak currents (d).

70, 80, 90 and 100 mV/s) (e) and the corresponding calibration plots
between different scan rate versus the anodic and cathodic peak currents
(f).

The electrochemical active surface
area for bare and modified electrodes
was calculated by the Randles–Sevcik equation as shown below.31 i  where A is the electroactive
surface area, C is the concentration of the probe
molecule in the solution (mol/cm3), D is
the diffusion coefficient of the molecule (equal to 6.70 ± 0.02
× 10–6 cm2/s), γ is the scan
rate (V/s), and n is the number of electrons in the
redox reaction. The calculated A value for the GCE,
GCE/APTES/rGO, and GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4 were
0.078, 0.287, and 0.272 cm2 respectively.

EIS experiments
were performed to verify impedance changes during
the modification processes and to confirm synergy between various
modified electrodes and the results are shown in Figure 4b. Theoretically, the diameter
of the semicircular portion represents the electron transfer limited
process, which is equivalent to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). It is observed that the semicircular diameter
of the modified electrodes decreased substantially compared with that
of bare GCE, indicating the decline of electron transfer resistance.
Comparing with the modified electrode, the bare GCE shows the largest
semicircle with an Rct of 202 Ω,
showing the lowest transfer rate, whereas for the GCE/APTES/rGO and
GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4-modified electrode, the Rct value is 85, and 93 Ω, respectively.
This phenomenon suggested that the introduction of rGO-NiCo2O4 nanostructures effectively improved the electron-transfer
capability of the modified electrode.

In order to explore the
influence of reaction kinetics on the peak
current of o-NP and p-AP, CVs at
different scan rates were investigated for GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4-modified electrode. As shown in Figure 4c–f, the peak currents
for both o-NP and p-AP increase
linearly with the scan rate from 20 to 100 mV s–1. These results suggest the electrochemistry of the rGO-NiCo2O4-modified GCE, corresponding to an adsorption-controlled
electrochemical process32 and consistent
with the fast charge propagation with the proposed sensor.

3.3 Individual Voltammetric Responses of o-NP and p-AP
The electrochemical
behavior of the modified electrode in the presence of different concentration
of target analytes and their calibration curves were investigated
by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in the wide potential range
and presented in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, the change of DPVs indicates that the oxidative peak current (Ipa) increases with the concentration (C) of o-NP. The calibration curve for o-NP exhibits two linear segments in the range from 5.0
× 10–9 to 5.0 × 10–7 M (R2 = 0.996) and 1.0 × 10–6 to 2.5 × 10–5 M (R2 = 0.992), with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 5.0 ×
10–9 M. On the other hand, a linear relation between
the peak current and concentration for p-AP (Figure 5b) is in the range
of 1.0 × 10–8 to 5.0 × 10–7 M (R2 = 0.996) and 1.0 × 10–6 to 1.0 × 10–4 M (R2 = 0.987), with a detection limit of 1.0 ×10–8 M (S/N = 3), which is lower than many reported methods. Table 1 represents the comparison
of the analytical findings of this study with several modified electrodes
reported in the last few years.

Figure 5 DPVs obtained for determination of o-NP using
the GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4-modified electrode
in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 with a wide range of concentrations from 5.0 ×10–9 to 25 ×10–6 M of o-NP (a);
determinations of p-AP with a wide range of concentrations
from 1.0 × 10–8 to 100 × 10–6 M (b). All the graphs on the right side show the corresponding calibration
curves for low and high concentrations.

The reproductivity and stability of the GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4 electrode have also been evaluated at different
cycle numbers. The observed RSD value of 2.11 and 1.87% for o-NP, and p-AP, respectively, indicate
excellent reproducibility. Moreover, the modified electrode is kept
at 4 °C for three weeks and a slightly decreased oxidation peak
current (lower than 7%) is observed which illustrates the good film
stability of the proposed sensor.

The feasibility and performance
of the proposed sensor were investigated
with the detection of target analytes in environmental samples. Several
tap water samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
(0.1 M, pH 7.0) and the obtained recovery results ranged from 98.5
to 101.5%, which reveals the possibility of the proposed sensor for
real sample analysis. The recovery values were estimated by the standard
addition method and the results are summarized in Table SI-1 (Supporting Information).

4 Conclusions
We have reported a novel strategy for facile
synthesis of rGO-conjugated
NiCo2O4 architectures by the one-pot hydrothermal
method. The detail of urchin-like shape formation was investigated
and a growth mechanism was discussed. The experimental results revealed
that the rGO-NiCo2O4 nanocomposite-modified
GCE electrode was attributed to the large specific surface area and
multiple oxidation states for the detection of phenol derivatives.
In particular, the electrode displays excellent analytical performance
for the electrochemical sensing of o-NP and p-NP with broad linear dynamic ranges and a very low detection
limit of 5.0 × 10–9 and 1.0 × 10–8 M for o-NP and p-NP, respectively.
Additionally, the modified electrode shows applicability for the detection
of these analytes in tap water samples with high recovery values.
Hence, the proposed GCE/APTES/rGO-NiCo2O4 sensor
could provide a potential platform for recognition and detection of
phenol isomers in environmental control and chemical industry.
