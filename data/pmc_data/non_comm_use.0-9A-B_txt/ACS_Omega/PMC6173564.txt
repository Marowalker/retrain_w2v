The present study was conducted to
develop therapeutically effective
controlled release formulation of pirfenidone (PFD) and explore the
possibility to reduce the total administered dose and dosing regimen.
For this purpose, pH-sensitive biomaterial was prepared by inducing
carboxymethyl group on pullulan by Williamson ether synthesis reaction,
and further, interpenetrating polymeric network microspheres were
prepared by glutaraldehyde-assisted water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion cross-linking
method, which showed higher swelling ratio in acidic and basic pH.
The formation of microspheres was confirmed by different spectral
characterization techniques, and thermal kinetic study indicated the
formation of thermally stable microspheres. Cell viability and biocompatibility
studies on hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell showed the polymeric
matrix to be biocompatible. In vitro dissolution of optimized formulation
(F5) showed releases of 54.09 and 76.37% in 0.1 N HCl after 2 h and
phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) up to 8 h, respectively. In vivo performances
of prepared microsphere and marketed product of PFD were compared
in rabbit. Tmax (time taken to reach peak
plasma concentration) was found to be achieved at 0.83 h, compared
to 0.5 h for Pirfenex with no significant difference complementing
the immediate action, while area under curve was significantly greater
for optimized formulation (9768 ± 1300 ng h/mL) compared to Pirfenex
(4311 ± 110 ng h/mL), complementing the sustained action. In
vivo pharmacokinetic study suggested that the prepared microsphere
could be a potential candidate for therapeutically effective controlled
delivery of PFD used in dyspnea and cough management due to idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis.

1 Introduction
Drug
delivery through oral route is the most common delivery route
for administration of drugs to elicit the therapeutic response.1 As per the reports of future market insights,
the oral controlled release drug delivery technology global market
will register a growth rate of 7.2% during 2017–2027 and the
market will generate a revenue of U.S. $50 000 million by the
end of 2027.2 An ideal dose in the treatment
is the one that quickly attains the minimum therapeutic concentration
in blood plasma and the concentration is maintained in the therapeutic
window for the entire duration of treatment. The conventional sustained-release
drug-delivery system predominantly maintains the plasma drug concentration
for a longer period of time by deferring “time to reach peak
plasma concentration” (tmax) in
contrast to immediate-release drug-delivery system. So, minimum effective
plasma concentration could be achieved quickly from immediate-release
drug-delivery system, but at the same time, drug will not be available
in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) for sustained absorption, as there
is no release-controlling step in the dosage form, requiring a frequent
dosing of the drug.3 The fluctuation of
drug plasma concentration may lead to shoot beyond toxic level or
remain below minimum therapeutic level, causing toxic manifestation
in both the cases.4,5 So, there is always a need to
develop a drug-delivery system that could be able to burst release
the drug as to achieve tmax quickly for
immediate action and thereafter release the drug in a precontrolled
manner to maintain the plasma drug concentration for a longer duration
of time.3 In the last few decades, application
of natural polymer in controlled drug-delivery system has gained a
significant importance in medical and biomedical applications.6,7 The various different polymers harnessed include xanthan gum7 chitosan,8 gellan
gum,9 locust bean gum,10 guar gum,11 etc. In most reports,
it was observed that the in vitro release of drug(s) from the polymeric
matrix sustained more than 24 h.12−15 But the residence time of any
solid oral formulation in gastrointestinal tract is as maximum as
8–10 h depending on the fed and fasted conditions unless the
formulation is modified for specific targets. Therefore, a large amount
of drugs still remains in the formulation matrix after 8–10
h, which could not be available for absorption, meaning underutilization
of delivered dose.4 Hence, there is a need
to control the drug release from a rate-controlling polymer matrix
within certain hours (8–10 h) to achieve maximum absorption
of drug. The amount of rate-controlling polymer used in formulation
is not only the factor that controls the release rate, but other factors
such as swelling properties, network cross-linking sites, and density
plays a crucial role to achieve preprogrammable release rate within
a certain time periods.16−19 Accordingly, there is a need to tailor the native
polymer to incorporate the required properties.

Interpenetrating
polymeric network (IPN) is one such innovative
form of drug-delivery system, which comprises two or more networks,
partially interlaced on a molecular scale, which cannot be separated
until the chemical bonds are broken.20 Hence,
there are many variables available in the IPN system, which ultimately
gives us the opportunity to achieve intended specific requirements.
Apart from modification of the polymer used as the backbone in IPN
system, other variables such as the amount of cross-linker and, more
specifically, drug polymer ratio will also be available to control
the release rate within the transit time period.21

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic,
catastrophic,
and progressive lung disease with very-difficult-to-treat situation,
leading to respiratory failure and death within 3–5 years of
diagnosis. The initial symptoms of IPF are dyspnea, cough, fatigue,
depression, anxiety, relationship problem, and financial difficulties,
of which dyspnea and cough are the serious issues for which management
is immediately required. There is no evidence of cough suppression
by opioids in IPF patients, while pirfenidone (PFD) has been proved
to be effective with beneficial effects on a subgroup population suffering
with IPF.22

Our aim is to develop
a therapeutically effective controlled drug-delivery
system for the symptomatic management of IPF, which will be able to
release the required amount of drug as loading dose and rest of the
drug in equivalent rate as maintenance dose. As PFD is used in management
of dyspnea and cough in IPF patients, the time taken to achieve peak
plasma concentration (tmax) should be
as low as possible to get immediate relief from the dyspnea and cough.
In a study conducted by the sponsors for approval filing to U.S. Food
and Drug Administration, it was found that 45.80 ± 8.24% of the 14C PFD dose was absorbed from the stomach within 30 min.23 Hence, the swelling behavior of polymeric matrix
must be pH-dependent so that the release of drug from the matrix in
stomach (acidic pH) would be sufficient to meet the criteria of loading
dose. Polymeric matrix must also be able to release the rest of the
drug in intestine as to suffice the maintenance dose within the transit
time of approximately 6 h. The swelling characteristic of IPN microspheres
using carboxymethylated polymer and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was
studied by different scientists, which confirmed pH-dependent swelling
behavior, indicating a higher swelling index in alkaline medium.19,24,25 So, to develop IPN microsphere
of PFD with similar characteristics, the native biopolymer pullulan
was modified to carboxymethyl pullulan (CMP), to render it pH-sensitive
before preparing IPN microsphere. The pH sensitivity is a prerequisite,
as swelling followed by drug release will be affected by pH of the
media.

Microsphere was prepared using glutaraldehyde (GA)-assisted
water-in-oil
(w/o) emulsion cross-linking technique. Spectral characterization
was performed to confirm the cross-linking and formation of IPN microsphere.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was performed
to study the shape and surface morphology of microspheres. In vitro
enzymatic degradation was performed to assure the degradability of
microspheres. Biocompatibility study and cell viability study were
conducted on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay and cell imaging techniques. In vitro release profile and release
kinetics of all formulations (F1–F9) were explored. Finally,
optimized formulation and marketed product (Pirfenex) were subjected
to an in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) study in rabbits and different
PK parameters were compared, showing that the microsphere was able
to control release for 12 h, with Cmax achieved in 0.83 h, satisfying our goal. In this way, the developed
formulation could be a suitable candidate for therapeutically effective
controlled release formulation of PFD.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Carboxymethyl
Pullulan and Effect
of Various Process Variables on Degree of Substitution (DS)
Pullulan is composed of a linear chain of maltotriose units linked
by α-(1 → 6) glycosidic bond and possess various hydroxyl
groups in its structure, which are desirable for substitution of carboxymethyl
groups. The reaction pathway for the synthesis of CMP is illustrated
in Figure S1, Supporting Information.

All of the process variables were taken into consideration to maximize
the DS as per Table 1.

2.1.1 Effect of Process Variables
on DS
Degree of substitution
is the initial and main characterization parameter for a successful
carboxymethylation reaction. DS value was found to be highly dependent
on the concentration of sodium hydroxide, MCA, and reaction temperature,
as can be observed from Table 1 and Figure S2, Supporting Information.
With increase in the concentration of sodium hydroxide up to 10 mL,
the DS value increased (DS = 0.539) and then started to decrease with
further increase of NaOH concentration (15 and 20 mL, DS = 0.395 and
0.328, respectively). The initial increase in DS value was due to
the activation of polymer for the formation of alkoxide and facilitated
the swelling of pullulan for enhanced diffusion and penetration of
etherifying agent (MCA). The DS value was reduced on further increase
of NaOH concentration due to the competition between the main reaction
and the side reaction of NaOH and MCA, with the side reaction becoming
predominant with increased production of glycolate.26 The effect of MCA concentration was also studied, and at
optimized concentration of NaOH, the DS value initially increased
with increasing MCA concentration and then reduced on further increase
in MCA concentration (Figure S2b, Supporting
Information), due to increased formation of glycolate with increased
MCA.27 The effect of temperature on DS
value was also studied, which showed the highest DS value (0.539)
at 65 °C and reduced values at 35 °C (0.282) and 95 °C
(0.433) (Figure S2c, Supporting Information).
The reduced DS value at reduced temperature was observed due to less
swelling of polymer and lack of activation energy to initiate and
drive the reaction, while increased temperature caused chain degradation
and intramolecular elimination of water, leading to a reduced number
of hydroxyl groups available for substitution.26 Thus, considering the above observation, reaction condition
was optimized based on the highest DS value.

2.2 Formulation of PVA-CMP IPN Microspheres
In the present
work, IPN microspheres were prepared using the (w/o)
emulsion cross-linking technique. The synthetic biopolymer PVA was
blended with CMP and interlaced on the backbone of CMP with the help
of GA, a bifunctional chemical cross-linker, which formed acetal bond
between the hydroxyl group of PVA and CMP. This resulted in the formation
of interpenetrating polymer network, a three-dimensional (3D) structure
of hydrogels, which can be distinguished from the regular polymeric
blends.28 The prepared microspheres were
insoluble in water and showed controlled hydration property with drug
entrapped in the polymeric network. The reaction pathway for the formation
of IPN microsphere is presented in Figure S3, Supporting Information.

2.3 Physicochemical Characterization
2.3.1 Elemental Analysis
The presence
of different elements (C, H, and O) in native pullulan and CMP was
determined, and the results are presented in Table 1. The results showed that there was a significant
increment in oxygen content in all of the batches of CMP compared
to native pullulan and highest for CMP-2 (63.80%). This observation
was due to the attachment of −CH2COONa group at
the replaceable hydroxyl group of pullulan. The carbon and hydrogen
contents were found to be reduced for CMP (C = 30.91%, H = 5.29%,
for CMP-2) compared to native pullulan (C = 41.06%, H = 7.72%) due
to polymer chain distortion because of high concentration of NaOH,
vigorous stirring during the reaction, and participation of hydrogen
in the formation of water molecules.

2.3.2 Viscosity
Study
The viscosity of
native pullulan was found to be 98.50 cP, which is higher compared
to all CMP batches (69.40–60.20 cP), as evident in Table 2. The reduced viscosity
was observed due to the use of concentrated NaOH and monochloroacetic
acid at elevated temperature for modification. This condition initiated
breaking of polymeric backbone by β-elimination reaction at
the reducing sugar units containing hydroxyl groups. Further, during
the reaction in alkaline media, saccharinic acids are generated, which
increases the aqueous solubility and reduces the viscosity.29

2.3.3 Weight Average Molecular
Weight and Polydispersity
Index
The effect of modification of native pullulan was clearly
understood from the DS value, and molecular weight analysis revealed
increased molecular weight of all batches of CMP compared to that
of native pullulan (8.51 × 105 Da). The increment
in molecular weight was due to the introduction of carboxymethyl group
on the polymeric backbone, which affects the hydrodynamic volume of
the polymer molecules and affects chain aggregation. Furthermore,
pullulan is a nonionic polymer, while after introduction of the carboxymethyl
group, it becomes polyelectrolyte (charged polymer molecule) and hence
the molecular weights of ionic and nonionic biopolymers cannot be
directly compared. The polydispersity index (PDI) of pullulan was
1.922, and for CMP, it was in the range of 1.719–1.002 (Table 2), indicating more
uniform molecular mass distribution of CMP compared to pullulan.30

2.3.4 Contact Angle and Surface
Energy Measurement
The study was conducted to visualize the
changes in the wettability
of CMP compared to native pullulan, and the results are shown in Table 2 and the images of
contact angle are shown in Figure S4, Supporting
Information. After carboxymethylation, the contact angle was found
to be decreased with increased surface energy compared to native pullulan.
The contact angle was found to be lowest for the highest value of
DS and gradually increased with decreasing DS value, as evident from Tables 1 and 2. The reason for this observation is the presence of highly
polar −COO– group in CMP, which increases
the affinity toward polar molecules like water and easily breaks its
cohesive forces, resulting in increased wettability with reduced contact
angle.

2.3.5 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy was performed initially for pullulan and CMP
to confirm the carboxymethylation of pullulan. The FTIR spectra of
pullulan showed characteristic peaks at 3605 and 2918 cm–1 due to stretching vibrations of free hydroxyl (−OH) and −CH2 groups, respectively. Further, various peaks were observed
in the range of 1250–1070 cm–1 due to stretching
vibrations of C–O–H and C–O–C from ether
linkage. In case of FTIR spectra of CMP, a broad peak at 3622 cm–1 was observed, indicating the utilization of hydroxyl
group in the chemical reaction. The characteristic peaks of CMP were
observed due to C=O stretching of COO– ions,
C–O stretching of ether, C–O–H stretching/bending,
and C–O–C (symmetric) stretching at 1635, 1518, 1450,
1024, and 898 cm–1, respectively.31

The FTIR spectra of PVA (Figure 1a) showed the characteristic peak at 3622
cm–1 because of the presence of stretching vibration
of free hydroxyl group. A sharp peak was observed at 2900 cm–1 due to C–H vibration of alkyl group and at 1500 cm–1 due to the bending vibration of the −CH2 group
present in PVA.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of (a) PVA, (b) pullulan, (c) CMP, (d) pure
drug,
(e) placebo IPN, and (f) drug-loaded IPN.

The FTIR spectra of PFD (Figure 1d) showed characteristic peaks at 3050, 1531,
and 1668
cm–1 due to aromatic C–H stretching vibration,
aromatic C=C stretching vibration, and stretching vibrations
of tertiary amide group.

The FTIR spectra of placebo microsphere
(Figure 1e) showed
broadened peak of hydroxyl group,
indicating participation of hydroxyl group in acetal bond formation.
Further, characteristic peaks at 2860 and 2940 cm–1 were observed due to aldehyde-related C–H stretching, a duplet
absorption with peaks contributed through alkyl chain.32 A peak at 1724 cm–1 was observed,
which may be due to the C=O group of PVA acetate. The small
peak at 1246 cm–1 and other broader absorption band
in the range of 1050–1140 cm–1 was observed
for ether and acetal linkage. The appearance of these new peaks confirmed
the formation of IPN microspheres. Similarly, FTIR spectroscopy was
performed for finished product (Figure 1f), which showed additional peaks at 1618 and 1531
cm–1, indicating the presence of drug, along with
all of the peaks observed in placebo microspheres. This confirmed
the formation of PFD-loaded IPN microspheres.

2.3.6 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
was performed for PVA, pullulan, CMP, and CMP-PVA IPN microsphere.
In the Raman spectra of pullulan (Figure 2b), the characteristic bands at 2913, 1471,
and 1352 cm–1 were due to C–H stretching,
C–H bending, and O–H bending vibrations, respectively.
The different characteristic peaks observed at 1132 cm–1 (broad band), and 941 and 858 cm–1 (sharp peaks)
were attributed to C–O–C (asymmetric) and C–O–C
stretching, respectively. The Raman spectra (Figure 2c) of CMP also showed the characteristic
peaks of pullulan with an additional peak at 1752 cm–1 due to C=O stretching of acid present in the carboxymethyl
group.

Figure 2 Raman spectra of (a) PVA, (b) pullulan, (c) CMP, and (d) placebo
IPN.

The monomeric unit of PVA (−CH2–CHOH−)
is mainly responsible for the vibrational spectra of PVA (Figure 2a). The prominent
peaks at 2913, 1449, and 1366 cm–1 were due to C–H
stretching, C–H bending, and O–H bending vibrations,
respectively. The C–O stretching and C–C stretching
vibrations were observed at 1150 and 918 cm–1, respectively.
These observed bands were at similar wavenumbers, as reported previously.33

In the case of IPN microsphere (Figure 2d), the duplet absorption
peak was observed
at 2940 and 2860 cm–1 due to aldehyde-related C–H
stretching contributed through alkyl chain. The peak at 1752 and 1441
cm–1 was observed due to C=O stretching of
acid and C–O stretching of ether. The peaks observed at 1130,
850, and 804 cm–1 were due to acetal linkage (C–O–C)
formed during cross-linking reactions, confirming the formation of
IPN microsphere.

2.3.7 Solid State 13C NMR Spectroscopy
The NMR spectra of pullulan were presented
in our previous work.21 The spectra showed
distinct peaks for different
carbon atoms, which was assigned unambiguously to all six carbon atoms.
The peaks of C6 atom (6 g 1 → 4) and primary C6 atom (4 g-unit)
were observed
at δ = 63.340 and 62.314 ppm, respectively. The peak observed
at 73.423 ppm was broadened with increased intensity due to merging
and overlapping of C2, C3, and C5 carbon atoms of pullulan. The peaks
observed at 82.483 and 102.995 ppm were assigned to C4 and C1 carbon
atoms of pullulan. Similarly, the peaks observed for CMP (Figure 3a) were also assigned
for all of the carbon atoms. The spectra showed the appearance of
additional peaks at 178.021 ppm compared to native pullulan, which
indicated the presence of carbonyl group of carboxymethyl group at
the 2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-positions. Further, the peak at 72.483 ppm
was observed due to the presence of methylene group at 2-O-, 3-O-,
and 6-O-positions, which indicated successful modification of pullulan
to carboxymethyl pullulan. The NMR spectra of PVA were reported earlier,34,35 which showed sharp peaks for −CH2 carbon and three
split peaks due to the resonance carbon of PVA at 43 and 60–80
ppm, respectively. The 13C NMR spectra of placebo PVA-CMP
IPN microsphere are shown in Figure 3b. The peak at 22.235 ppm was assigned to the aliphatic
carbon of the −CH2 group in PVA. Different peaks
observed in the range of 37–42 ppm (37.190, 39.327, and 44.112
ppm) were due to the aliphatic carbons of GA. The peak C6 carbon of
CMP was observed at 68.809 ppm, and the peak at 73.936 ppm (C2, C3,
and C5 carbons of CMP) was broadened and observed with increased intensity
due to merging of CH resonance peak of PVA and methylene group of
carboxymethyl pullulan. The peak at 102.307 ppm was due to the acetal
carbon, confirming the formation of IPN microsphere. The last peak
observed at 171.441 ppm was due to the carbonyl carbon atom present
in CMP. So, the NMR spectra confirmed carboxymethylation and the formation
of GA-assisted cross-linked IPN microsphere.

placebo PVA-CMP IPN microsphere.

2.3.8 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Spectroscopy
The XRD spectra of pure drug showed intense peaks at 2θ values
of 8.46, 14.42, 15.04, 18.46, 22.92, 24.36, 26.9, and 32.4, due to
its crystalline nature. The XRD spectra of placebo IPN and drug loading
(DL) IPN microspheres did not show any peak because of the amorphous
nature of the polymer and the presence of drug in molecularly dispersed
form in the polymer matrix (Figure S5,
Supporting Information), respectively, and found to be consistent
with previous reports.36,37

2.3.9 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The DSC thermogram of PFD and
PVA showed a sharp endothermic peak
at 110.40 and 192.19 °C, respectively, due to its melting transition.
No peak was observed in the DSC thermogram of CMP. In the case of
placebo and PFD-loaded IPN microsphere (Figure S6, Supporting Information), no sharp peak was observed; instead,
a broad curve at 70 °C was observed due to the presence of moisture
in the three-dimensional networks of microsphere. The absence of a
sharp peak in the PFD-loaded microsphere indicated the presence of
drug in the form of molecular dispersion in the polymer matrix and
suggested a consistent result with that of XRD.

2.3.10 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
The surface
morphologies of pullulan, CMP, and PVA-CMP IPN were
investigated by FESEM (Figure 4). The FESEM images indicated that the native polymer was
oval, ellipsoidal, and irregular shaped, while the modified pullulan
was rough with sharp end break point geometry. The change in the geometry
may be due to breaking of polymeric backbone during chemical reaction
because of the application of highly concentrated alkali and MCA.
The surface morphology and cross-sectional area of prepared microsphere
were also investigated to confirm the network formation. Figure 4c shows a group of
microsphere, and Figure 4d shows the FESEM image of a single microsphere. From the image,
it was observed that the prepared microsphere was spherical in shape
and rough in morphology with numerous tiny pores present on the surface,
indicating the formation of porous polymeric matrix, which may become
a factor for diffusion-dominant release behavior of drug from microspheres.
The FESEM image of the cross-sectional area of microsphere (Figure 4e) revealed a highly
cross-linked network structure responsible for swelling and confirmed
the successful formation of IPN network inside microsphere.

2.4 Thermal Kinetic Study
2.4.1 Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed for
CMP, the three different
placebo microspheres prepared using different concentrations of GA
(1, 3, and 5 mL), pure drug PFD, and optimized formulation (F5) using
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA-4000, PerkinElmer). TGA and differential
thermal gravimetric (DTG) (first derivative) curves were plotted using
double Y axis graph against temperature (K) for each
analyzed sample, as presented in Figures S7–S12, Supporting Information. The TGA curve of CMP showed a single-step
major degradation of 67.32% in the temperature range of 507–630
K, supported by DTG curve showing the sharp peak of degradation at
552 K at a heating rate of 5 K/min. The degradation peak of CMP at
different heating rates 5, 10, 15, and 20 K was found to be slightly
shifted toward higher temperatures 552, 564, 567, and 578 K, respectively,
as shown in the DTG curve of Figure S7,
Supporting Information. The observation was due to heat transfer lag
in the heating rate.38 Earlier, we had
reported the thermal analysis of pullulan performed with similar methodology,
which showed a single-step sharp degradation peak at 590 K. The observed
difference suggested structural changes during carboxymethylation;
furthermore, the presence of sodium ion of sodium carboxymethyl group
in the CMP also alters the thermal decomposition pattern,39 which confirmed successful modification of pullulan.

The TGA and DTG curves of PVA were reported in our previous study,21 which indicated a sharp degradation peak at
600 K due to rapid chain fastening and elimination of H2O, converting the polyenes to aliphatic group by Diels–Alder
intramolecular cyclization or radical reactions. Upon progress of
reaction, the C–C cleavage and its carbonization occurred at
720 and 750 K, respectively.40

The
TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves of IPN microsphere
showed different degradation patterns from its individual components.
In the case of microsphere, four degradation zones were observed in
the range of 300–850 K. The first degradation was observed
as a small hump in the range of 363–435 K with a nominal weight
loss of 4.83%, which could be due to loss of moisture entrapped in
the polymeric network. The second zone of degradation was from 526
to 678 K, with a weight loss of 55.47%, indicating the major degradation
zone. The DTG curve in this range showed a broad peak at 647 K for
lower heating rates (5 and 10 K/min), which became comparatively sharper
for heating rates (15 and 20 K/min) due to increased heating rate.
This indicated the formation of IPN microsphere as the degradation
zone of CMP (507–630 K) and PVA (495–650 K) broadened
and shifted in the range of 526–678 K, which included rapid
breakage of polymeric chain into smaller units with elimination of
the hydroxyl group. The third step included breakage of carbon chains
(C–C), as evident with the sharp degradation peak at 706 K
(682–718 K), and the fourth degradation zone 718–789
K indicated carbonization and formation of tars of carbon units.

The thermal analysis of pure drug PFD showed a single-step degradation
at 510 K at a heating rate of 5 K/min degradation range (429.28–515
K), which was shifted to higher temperature with increase in heating
rate (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

Thermogram of optimized formulation (F5) showed a similar pattern
to placebo microsphere (Figure S12, Supporting
Information). The degradation zone of drug was clearly visible in
the range of 427–544 K, but the degradation pattern and zones
remain the same, indicating the stability of the IPN matrix in the
presence of drug.

This thermal observation supported the formation
of IPN microsphere,
and their TGA and DTG curves at different temperatures are shown in Figures S8–S10, Supporting Information.

2.4.2 Activation Energy
Activation energy
(Ea) was calculated using the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall
(OFW) and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose (KAS) models. These
models yielded a slope value (Figure S13, Supporting Information) from the linear relationship between ln(β)
vs 1/T (eq 2) and the slope (Figure S14, Supporting
Information) of graph ln(β/T2) vs
1/T when multiplied with gas constant (R = 8.314 J/(mol K)). Slope activation energy as a function of degree
of conversion (α) for all of the samples is graphically shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Activation
energy as a function of the conversion factor (α)
using (a) OFW model and (b) KAS model.

In our previous report,21 activation
energy of pullulan was calculated, which showed initial higher activation
energy due to high energy requirement to initiate the glycosidic bond
cleavage, and once the polymeric chain started to decompose, the Ea value started to decrease. CMP showed an entirely
different pattern of Ea value at different
conversion factors due to harsh condition (use of concentrated NaOH
and MCA) during carboxymethylation process, causing scissions of the
helical coiled structure at the functional groups and the glycosidic
linkage, resulting in restructuring and substitution of carboxymethyl
group at the hydroxyl group. Initially, the activation energy for
CMP was the minimum at 0.1 (54.46 and 47.33 kJ/mol for OFW and KAS
models, respectively) and the energy required for next 10% degradation
(α = 0.2) was almost 3 times (138.9 and 129.98 kJ/mol for OFW
and KAS models, respectively), which was constant up to α =
0.6, showing major degradation of polymeric chain in this region,
and then significantly decreased, as evident from Figure 5.

IPNs showed an increasing
trend in the activation energy with increasing
conversion factor (α). The activation energy was minimum at
α = 0.1 and increased up to α = 0.7, which showed that
high energy was required with increasing step for polymeric chain
cleavage due to the formation of cross-linked network structure (formation
of IPN), and then decreased at α = 0.8, indicating decomposition
of almost polymeric chain and network. At this stage, different pyrolysis
byproducts (dehydrated products of carbon structure) like alkane,
alkene, dienes, and aromatic cyclization of carbonaceous char residues
were formed and required high activation energy for its conversion
to carbon tars as evident at α = 0.9, in Figure 5, and at this stage, weight loss was about
99% and no residue was left.41 This kind
of observation was consistent with all of the three IPN microspheres
and activation energy increased with increasing concentration of cross-linker
at a fixed conversion factor.

The activation energy of the optimized
formulation was found to
be slightly reduced (Figure 5) in the entire range of α = 0.1–0.9. The observation
may be due to the effect of drug, so the Ea value of drug was also calculated, which on an average was found
to be 92.49 kJ/mol, much lower than placebo IPNs. The increasing trend
of Ea value with increasing conversion
factor suggests the formation of stable PFD-entrapped IPN microsphere.

The data fitted in both the models showed almost parallel regression
lines (R2 > 0.99) in the conversion
range
(0.1 < α < 0.9), indicating the applicability of the OFW
and KAS models for the calculation of activation energy.41 Upon analysis of the Ea values of both models, the value for the KAS model is lower
than that of the OFW model, which can be due to the different approximations
of the temperature integral. However, both the models show similar
trend without any significant difference on Ea with conversion factor under consideration (0.1–0.9),
indicating the chosen isoconversional models to be reasonably true.

2.5 In Vitro Enzymatic Degradation Study
In vitro action of pullulanase (E.C. No. 3.2.1.41) was studied on
CMP and PVA-CMP IPN microsphere (placebo) to assure the biodegradation
of synthesized novel products. Pullulanase is a debranching enzyme,
which specifically hydrolyzes α-(1 → 6) glycosidic bond.42 The experimentally obtained data were plotted
as a digestibility curve of CMP (Figure 6a) and PVA-CMP IPN microsphere (Figure 6b). The digestibility
curve of CMP showed faster digestion (45.77% after 8 h) compared to
IPN microsphere (41.97% after 48 h). This indicated a very low digestion
rate for IPN microsphere due to the formation of 3D polymer network
during cross-linking reaction, compared to CMP, which was present
in its two-dimensional structure and the α-(1 → 6) glycosidic
bond was easily accessible by the enzyme.

Figure 6 Digestibility curves
of (a) CMP and (b) CMP-PVA IPN microsphere,
and logarithm of slope (LOS) plots of (c) CMP and (d) CMP-PVA IPN
microsphere.

The log of slope (LOS)
plot for the degradation data was made for
CMP and IPN microsphere, which showed two degradation phases for both
the test materials (Figure 6c,d). The LOS plot yielded two straight lines after it was
fitted in the first-order kinetic equation (eq 11). Degradation rate constant (k) in min–1 was calculated from the slope value,
and C∞ form the intercept of the
straight line equation generated from the first-order kinetic equation43,44 (Table S1, Supporting Information). The
digestibility rate constant for CMP was higher than IPN microsphere
in both the phases due to the linear structure of CMP in which the
α-(1 → 6) glycosidic bond was easily accessible compared
to sterically hindered target sites of microsphere due to network
formation. This is also evident from the values of final concentration
(C∞), as reported in Table S1, Supporting Information. Furthermore,
the LOS graph yielded a linear regression line (R2 > 0.91), confirming the first-order digestibility
model
to be a suitable predictor for enzymatic degradation in our test materials.

2.6 In Vitro Cytotoxicity Test and Biocompatibility
Assessment
The modified biopolymer will be used for the formulation
dosage forms for oral route, so it is essential to confirm the noncytotoxic
and biocompatible nature of the material. The MTT assay for CMP and
PVA-CMP IPN microsphere was performed at four different concentrations
(1000, 500, 100, and 50 μg/mL) and with direct contact to microsphere
and compared to control. After 72 h of incubation, the results showed
no significant difference in the cell viability (data presented as
mean ± standard deviation (SD, n = 3)), as shown
in Figure 7a. Biocompatibility
assessment was performed by cell imaging technique, which used fluorescent
dye rhodamine-phalloidin for actin staining and Hoechst 33342 for
nucleus staining. These images did not show any remarkable change
in cellular morphology compared to control (Figure 7b-i–iv). FESEM image analysis showed
that cells were adhered and spread onto the surface of microsphere
(Figure 7b-vii,viii),
indicating the noncytotoxic and biocompatible nature of the biopolymer
and its microsphere.

(Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3).) The
scale bar for the images (i)–(iv) is 400 μm and for (v)–(vi)
is 1000 μm.

2.7 Acute
Oral Toxicity Study
The hematological
and serum biochemical analysis reports are presented in Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information. These
results indicated normal levels of hematological and serum biochemical
parameters, and no significant deviation was observed in test animals
compared to control animals. The histopathological images of the vital
organs like heart, liver, kidney, and stomach did not showed any significant
difference (Figure S15, Supporting Information).
Further zero mortality of the animals were observed, indicating the
LD50 value of CMP and PVA-CMP IPN microsphere to be greater
than the recommended dose (2000 mg/kg) of body weight. Therefore,
CMP and PVA-CMP IPN microsphere were classified under “category
5” with “zero toxicity” indicating safe for drug-delivery
application through oral route.

2.8 Characterization
of PFD-Loaded PVA-CMP IPN
Microsphere
2.8.1 Estimation of Percentage
Yield
The total amount of microsphere prepared for each formulation
(F1–F9)
was calculated in terms of percentage yield, and is shown in Table 3. The yield was found
to be dependent on the concentration of GA and percentage drug loading
(% DL) in the system. The results showed that yield was found to be
decreased with increasing drug loading due to limited solubility of
PFD (20 mg/mL) and remained unentrapped in the system. The second
factor (GA concentration) showed increased yield of final product,
with increased GA concentration. The result was in good agreement
as the increased concentration of GA enhanced breaking of polymeric
chain and exposed more hydroxyl group available for cross-linking
and formation for acetal bond between PVA and CMP in the emulsion
system. The mathematical relationship generated (in coded factors)
for percentage yield was as follows 1  The
predicted R2 of 0.9502 is in agreement
with the adjusted R2 of 0.9887 (p ≤ 0.05).

where y1 is the percentage
yield of
final product, x1 and x2 are the quantity of GA (mL) and percentage DL, respectively,
and its contour plot is shown in Figure S16a, Supporting Information.

2.8.2 Drug Entrapment Efficiency
(DEE)
The percentage DEE of the prepared microspheres (F1–F9)
was
calculated and found in the range of 22.56 ± 0.19 to 46.72 ±
0.49%, presented in Table 3. The entrapment efficiency of the microsphere was found to
be increasing with increasing concentration of GA at similar % DL
(at 15% DL, F9 < F6 < F8; at 30% DL, F2 < F3 < F4, and
at 45% DL, F7 < F1 < F5) values shown in Table 3. The observation was due to the reason that
increased concentration of GA increased the cross-linking density,
producing highly cross-linked polymer networks, thus preventing the
leaching of drug from polymer matrices. The increased drug content
in the emulsion system also increased DEE at the similar concentration
of GA, due to more availability of PFD in the system for cross-linking.45 The mathematical relationship generated (in
coded factors) for drug entrapment efficiency is as follows 2  The
predicted R2 of 0.9496 is in agreement
with the adjusted R2 of 0.9848 (p ≤ 0.05).

where y2 is the drug entrapment efficiency, x1 and x2 are the
quantity of GA (mL) and percentage DL, respectively, and its contour
plot is shown in Figure S16b, Supporting
Information.

2.8.3 Particle Size Analysis
The arithmetic
mean diameter [d (0.5)] was found, and also the polydispersity
index of microspheres (F1–F9) was found in the range of 810.12–989.15
μm (Table 3).
The formulations with high concentration of GA with same % DL showed
smaller particle size due to increased cross-linking density and more
squeezing of internal phase, resulting in decreased void space. The
increased particle size of microspheres with higher % DL was observed
due to the presence of high concentration of drug in the emulsion
system to be incorporated in the polymeric matrices. The polydispersity
index of the formulations was found to be in the range of 0.877–0.950,
indicating a narrow size distribution range, supporting formation
of microspheres prepared with uniform particle size. The histogram
and particle size distribution of the optimized formulation are shown
in Figure S17, Supporting Information.

2.8.4 Swelling Study
Swelling study of
prepared microspheres (F1–F9) was conducted in terms of its
equilibrium swelling ratio (% ESR) at two different pH buffers (pH
1.2 and 6.8). Higher swelling ratio was observed in microspheres prepared
by carboxymethyl pullulan in contrast to microspheres prepared by
native pullulan.21 Higher swelling ratio
(Table 3) in acidic
media was due to enhanced hydrophilicity induced by highly polar carboxymethyl
group in carboxymethyl pullulan.25 The
carboxymethyl group ionizes when pH of the media is above the pKa value (3.4–3.7) of carboxylic group.
Higher swelling ratio (Table 3) in basic media was due to the availability of free carboxylic
groups to form H-bond with water.46 The
swelling behavior was also dependent on the concentration of GA; results
showed decreased swelling ratio for increased GA concentration, which
was due to the increased extent of cross-linking and the consequent
formation of rigid polymeric matrix,47 which
prohibited the penetration of water into polymeric network. Percentage
drug loading showed a slight increase in % ESR with reduced drug loading,
probably due to reduced internal space on polymeric matrix with increased
drug quantity. A similar kind of swelling behavior was observed at
both the pH (1.2 and 6.8) for IPN microspheres prepared using carboxymethylated
polymer and PVA in different reports.19,24 This swelling
property was considered to be instrumental in achieving low value
of tmax required to get immediate relief
from dyspnea and cough in IPF and thereafter to release the required
drug within the transit time of intestine in sustained fashion as
maintenance dose.

2.8.5 In Vitro Drug Release
and Its Kinetic Modeling
2.8.5.1 In Vitro Drug Release
In vitro
drug release was performed for all in-house formulation (F1–F9)
to explore the drug-release profile, which showed release profile
to be dependent on the concentration of GA and drug loading ratio.
The cumulative percentage drug release versus time (h) is graphically
presented in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Release profile of PFD from different formulations (F1–F9)
in 0.1 N HCl and phosphate buffer (PB) pH 6.8.

The drug release profile was found to be dependent on GA
concentration.
The microspheres showed decreased drug release with increased GA concentration
(1, 3, and 5 mL) at constant % DL.48,49 For instance
at 1, 3, and 5 mL of GA at constant DL value (15%), the percentage
cumulative drug release decreased and was found to be 90.98, 49.38,
and 34.82% after 2 h (in 0.1 N HCl) and 99.82, 85.04, and 63.83% after
8 h (in PB pH 6.8) for formulations F9, F6, and F8, respectively.
The effect of drug loading at a fixed amount of GA (1 mL) did not
show any sustained action because 1 mL of GA could not form rigid
network structure required to release the drug in a sustained fashion
(F9 (15% DL), F2 (30% DL), and F7 (45% DL)), while drug loading has
the effect on drug release at a higher amount of GA (5 mL) (F8 (15%
DL), F4 (30% DL), and F5 (30% DL)). As the drug release mechanism
is governed by the diffusion process,50 the increased release drug pattern with increase in % DL was due
to high drug concentration in the polymeric matrix, which in turn
increased the concentration gradient and fastened the diffusion process
by reducing polymeric barrier. At the same time, formulations with
less % DL faced increased hindrance to cross the matrix barrier, which
reduced the diffusion process and overall controlled the drug release
for an increased time period.

2.8.5.2 Kinetic
Modeling of Drug Release
Zeroth-order51 and first-order kinetic
models52 (equation details provided in Section S.4.10.1, Supporting Information) were
applied to evaluate the drug-release kinetics for all of the batches
of microspheres (F1–F9). In the case of first-order kinetic
model, the R2 value for all of the batches
(Table S5, Supporting Information) was
found to be greater than that of the zero-order kinetic model, confirming
first-order drug-release kinetics, i.e., microspheres release the
drug in such a programmed manner that it is proportional to the amount
of drug remaining in the matrix in such a way that the amount of drug
released by unit of time diminish.53 In
1995, Muyle and Turko reported that pharmaceutical dosage forms containing
water-soluble drugs in porous matrices follow first-order kinetics
and our finding is consistent with the reports of Muyle and Turko,54 as PFD is a highly water-soluble drug. The mechanism
of drug release was studied using the Hixson–Crowell model,55 Higuchi model,56 and
Korsmeyer–Peppas model,57 whose
equations are provided in Section S.4.10.1, Supporting Information. The n value of formulations
F2, F7, and F9 was found to be less than 0.45, which indicated that
these formulations followed Fickian diffusion release mechanism. The n value for all other formulation was higher than 0.45 (Table S5, Supporting Information), indicating
non-Fickian diffusion process. The R2 value
of the Higuchi model was found to be greater than the Hixson–Crowell
model, indicating the diffusion process to be predominant over erosion
of polymer matrix for the release of PFD from microspheres.

2.8.5.3 Statistical Analysis of the Formulation
Variables on Release Rates: Drug Release after 2 h in 0.1 N HCl and
Drug Release after 8 h in Phosphate Buffer pH 6.8
The mathematical
relationship generated using Design-Expert software (trial version
7.0.0, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis) between variable and responses
(in coded factors) is as follows 3  The
predicted R2 of 0.9780 is in agreement
with the adjusted R2 of 0.9945 (p ≤ 0.05). 4  The
predicted R2 of 0.9474 is in agreement
with the adjusted R2 of 0.9879 (p ≤ 0.05).

where y3 is the percentage drug release after 2 h in
0.1 N HCl, y4 is the percentage drug release
after 8 h in phosphate buffer pH 6.8, and x1 and x2 are the GA quantity and percentage
DL, respectively, and its contour plot is shown in Figure S16c,d, Supporting Information.

Loading dose
and maintenance dose were calculated based on eqs 5 and 6, and it was found
that maintenance dose should not be less than
26.58% of the total dose. Therefore, final optimized formulation was
chosen based on the highest entrapment and “release after 2
h” not less than 26.58%. Hence, F5 was chosen as optimized
formulation with the highest entrapment (46.72% ± 0.49) and 54.09%
drug release after 2 h. 5   6  where Di is the
loading dose, Css is the steady-state
concentration, Vd is the volume of distribution, T is the time period, and F is the bioavailability.

2.9 Stability Study
Stability study was
conducted on the optimized formulation (F5) to study the effect of
environmental conditions on time. The drug stability results (description,
assay value, extent of drug release in 2 and 8 h (Table S6, Supporting Information) and complete dissolution
profile (Figure S18, Supporting Information))
showed consistent performance. The assay value after 6 months was
found to be 97.1 ± 2.1% (standard assay value 95–105%
as per PFD manufacturer certificate of analysis), which was within
limit values, confirming that the developed formulation (F5) was stable
for 6 months at accelerated conditions.

2.10 In Vivo
Pharmacokinetic Study of PFD in Rabbits
Marketed tablet of
PFD (Pirfenex) and in-house formulation (F5),
equivalent to 15 mg/kg body weight were administered to rabbits of
groups I and II, respectively. The plasma drug concentration was measured
at predetermined time intervals, graphically presented in Figure 9. Different pharmacokinetic
parameters like Cmax, tmax, AUC0–t, AUC0–∞, t1/2, Kel, and area under the first moment curve (AUMC)
and mean residence time (MRT) values of both the formulations were
calculated and compared in Table 4.

Time to achieve peak plasma concentration (tmax) predicts the rate of absorption and tmax value of F5 (0.83 ± 0.17 h), and Pirfenex
(0.5
± 0.00 h) did not show any significant difference (p < 0.05) indicating that the rate of absorption for formulation
F5 was similar to that for Pirfenex. Therefore, immediate relief from
dyspnea and cough in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis could be achieved
within approximately 1 h of dosing. Area under curve (AUC) measures
the extent of absorption, which was significantly greater for formulation
F5 (Table 4), indicating
prolonged duration of action. This suggested that the matrix of IPN
microsphere could efficiently control the in vivo drug release and
maintain the drug plasma level in therapeutic window up to 12 h. Finally,
this formulation could be a promising delivery system in terms of
immediate relief from dyspnea and cough along with reduction of dose
as well as dosing frequency by maintaining the plasma drug concentration
within the therapeutic window up to 12 h.

3 Conclusions
In the present study, a pH-sensitive therapeutically effective
IPN microsphere was prepared. Spectral characterization like FTIR
spectroscopy confirmed the drug polymer compatibility, and solid-state 13C NMR spectra confirmed the formation of GA-assisted IPN
microsphere. FESEM images revealed the spherical morphology of microspheres.
Acute oral toxicity study confirmed the material to be nonhemotoxic
in nature and classified in “category 5” with toxicity
rating of “zero”, confirming safe for use in drug-delivery
applications. The CMP and IPN microsphere were found to be digested
by enzyme pullulanase, confirming its biodegradable nature. The cell
viability and biocompatibility experiments showed the polymeric material
and formulation to be biocompatible as no significant decrease in
cell percentage viability was observed even at 1000 μg/mL up
to 72 h. Swelling study of prepared microspheres showed pH sensitivity
as comparatively higher swelling was observed in both acidic and alkaline
media compared to swelling ratio of IPN microspheres prepared by native
pullulan, which was essential to burst release the drug to get tmax as low as possible and further to control
the release rate to achieve sustained action. In vivo pharmacokinetic
parameters showed that tmax was found
to be shifted to 0.83 h, in contrast to 0.5 h for Pirfenex, the difference
was not significant (p < 0.05), indicating that
rate of absorption was similar to Pirfenex, while the AUC value for
microsphere increased significantly and release was controlled up
to 12 h. Thus, in vivo pharmacokinetic study revealed successful formulation
of therapeutically effective controlled release formulation of PFD.

Williamson synthesis reaction from pullulan using the same method
as reported earlier by our group with slight modification in reaction
parameters and conditions.25 Detailed synthetic
procedures are given in Section S.4.2,
Supporting Information.

4.2.1 Determination of Degree

(DS) for Carboxymethyl Group on Pullulan
DS was calculated
by the potentiometric back titration method using the equation below.58 The detailed methodology is discussed in Section S.4.2.1, Supporting Information. 7  where A is the
milliequivalents
of NaOH required per gram of sample.

4.3 Preparation

The IPN microspheres
were prepared using GA-assisted water-in-oil
(w/o) emulsion cross-linking method, as previously reported by our
group25,59 with slight modification. Detailed synthetic
procedures are given in Section S.4.3,
Supporting Information.

4.4 Physicochemical Characterization
Elemental analysis, viscosity measurement, molecular weight analysis,
contact angle, and surface energy measurement were performed for CMP,
while Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy,
solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis were performed for PVA,
pullulan, CMP, PFD, and GA cross-linked PVA-pullulan IPN microspheres
(placebo and drug loaded). These characterization studies were performed
by established methods, and the detailed methodology is discussed
in Section S.4.4, Supporting Information.

4.5 Thermal Kinetic Study
The thermal
kinetic studies of CMP, different blank IPN microspheres (GA: 1, 3,
and 5 mL), pure drug PFD, and optimized formulation (F5) were performed
with the same methodology as reported earlier.21 The study was performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer
TGA-4000 (PerkinElmer). The samples were taken in a quantity of approximately
5–7 mg in a ceramic pan, placed in the furnace chamber, and
heated at four different heating rates (5, 10, 15, and 20 K/min) from
300 to 900 K at constant flow of nitrogen gas at 20 mL/min. The activation
energy (Ea) was calculated using two different
isoconversional kinetic models, i.e., Ozawa–Flynn–Wall
(OFW)60,61 and Kissinger–Akahira–Sunose
(KAS)62,63 for different conversion factors (α)
from 0.1 to 0.9, using eqs 8 and 9, respectively, and the detailed
discussion
is provided in Section S.4.5, Supporting
Information. 8   9  

4.6 In Vitro
Enzymatic Degradation Study
In vitro degradation study was
conducted using enzyme pullulanase
(Sigma, St. Louis, E.C. No. 3.2.1.41). Both the test substances, CMP
and microsphere, were incubated in a water bath at 37 °C, and
an aliquot of 1 mL of sample was withdrawn at predetermined time intervals.
These samples were analyzed by reducing sugar assay method64,65 as described in Section S.4.6, Supporting
Information.

4.6.1 Predictive Modeling for Digestibility
The degradation data were best fitted to first-order equation,
and its first-order derivative yielded logarithm of slope (LOS).43,44 Different parameters like digestibility rate constant (k) and the concentration of the product at the end point of reaction
(C∞) were calculated from LOS plot
using the following equations 10   11  where Ct is the product concentration at time (t), C∞ is the product concentration at the
end of the reaction, k is the digestibility rate
constant, and  is the
logarithm of slope.

4.7 In Vitro Cytotoxicity Test
and Biocompatibility
Assessment
4.7.1 Cell Viability Study
Cell viability
study was performed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (Sigma) assay, as described earlier.66 Cell culture and maintenance are discussed in Section S.4.7.1, Supporting Information. HepG2
cells (180 μL) were seeded in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate
at a concentration of 1 × 104 cells/well and incubated
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for
24 h. Thereafter, the cells were treated with 20 μL of various
concentrations (1000–50 μg/mL) of CMP (previously sterilized
by UV light for three cycles 30 min each, and dissolved in incomplete
medium) for 72 h. For microspheres, 1 × 104 cells
were seeded onto preconditioned samples leaving in undisturbed condition
to allow cells adherence on them. Control wells did not contain any
test sample except 20 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
At predetermined time frame, spent media was replaced by fresh media
(180 μL) and aliquot of 20 μL of MTT from stock (5 mg/mL)
solution was added to each well. The plate was then incubated at 37
°C for 3 h and then replaced by 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide
to solubilize formazan crystal. Absorbance was taken at 570 nm using
a multiplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO series, Switzerland).
Cell viability was measured as percentage reduction of MTT compared
to control assigning 100% viability. Data were reported as mean ±
standard deviation (SD) of three different independent observations.

4.7.2 In Vitro Biocompatibility Test
Biocompatibility
of CMP and its microsphere was accessed by visualizing
cellular morphology using cell imaging technique with fluorescent
dyes and FESEM analysis.

4.7.2.1 Cell Imaging
To visualize cellular
morphology, cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescent
dye (Invitrogen) following the previously described protocol.67 Briefly, prior to staining, cells of 3 days
culture were fixed in 10% formalin solution (Sigma) overnight at room
temperature. The fixed cells were then washed in PBS and incubated
with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 30 min to inhibit the
nonspecific binding of dye. This was further followed by PBS washing
and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min. After
thorough PBS washing, the cells were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin
(0.165 μM) for 20 min in the dark. To visualize the nucleus,
the cells were counter-stained with 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma)
for 30 min. The images were recorded using a fluorescent microscope
(EVOS XL digital, Invitrogen).

4.7.2.2 Field
Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
(FESEM) Study
FESEM study was performed for the cell-seeded
microspheres of 3 days culture. These cells were fixed in 2.5% GA
for 3 h at room temperature, followed by gradual dehydration with
ethanol (30–100% v/v) and subsequently allowed to dry completely
in vacuum condition. The samples were then mounted on an aluminum
stub, followed by gold sputter coating for 130 s before analysis.
The images were recorded by a field emission electron microscope (Zeiss,
Sigma, Germany) at an operating voltage of 2 kV with a working distance
of 5 mm.

4.8 Acute Oral Toxicity Study
Acute oral
toxicity studies of CMP and PVA-CMP placebo IPN microspheres were
conducted as per Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development
guideline for the test of chemicals 425, adopted on 17 December 2001.
Details of the experimental procedure are provided in Section S.4.8, Supporting Information.

4.9 Preparation of PFD-Loaded PVA-CMP IPN Microspheres
The drug-loaded microspheres were prepared by adding required amount
of PFD to the aqueous phase, and the remaining process was similar
to that described in Section 4.3.

4.9.1 Formulation Variables
and Factorial Design
In the present study, 32 full
factorial design was adopted
and a total of nine formulations were prepared using the two factors
[quantity (mL) of cross-linking agent (X1) and % (w/w) drug loading ratio (X2)]
at three different levels [high level (+1), medium level (0), and
low level (−1)]. The percentage yield (Y1), drug entrapment efficiency (Y2), cumulative percentage drug release in 0.1 N HCl after 2 h (Y3) and in phosphate buffer after 8 h (Y4) were selected as the responses. Mathematical
equation model was generated by 32 factorial design,68 using Design-Expert software (trial version
7.0.0, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis) to analyze the generated responses
from dependent variables. 12  The different formulations
according to the
factorial design are presented in Table S4, Supporting Information, and the contour plot of responses is presented
in Figure S16, Supporting Information.

4.10 Characterization of PFD-Loaded PVA-CMP IPN
Microspheres
Drug-loaded microspheres were characterized
for their percentage yield, drug entrapment efficiency, particle size,
and equilibrium swelling behavior as per the previously reported method.69

4.10.1 In Vitro Drug Release
Study and Kinetic
Modeling
In vitro drug release profile for all of the prepared
formulations (F1–F9) were studied using USP type-1 dissolution
apparatus (Electro Lab TDT-08L, Mumbai, India) at 100 rpm and 37 ±
0.5 °C. The dissolution media used was 0.1 N HCl for initial
2 h and further continued in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 up to 8 h. The
samples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals, diluted suitably,
and analyzed at 311 nm in a UV–visible spectrophotometer (UV-1800,
Shimadzu, Japan). The average percentage cumulative drug release ±
SD (n = 3) was calculated and plotted against each
time interval. The drug release kinetics and mechanism were studied
using different models, which are described in Section S.4.10.1, Supporting Information.

4.10.2 Stability Study
The optimized
formulation (F5) was subjected to stability study loading as per International
Conference on Harmonization guidelines (Q1E, step 4) for oral finished
dosage form under accelerated conditions,70 and details are provided in Section S.4.10.2, Supporting Information.

4.11 In Vivo
Pharmacokinetic Study
4.11.1 Estimation of PFD in
Rabbit Plasma
PFD content in rabbit plasma was estimated
for the marketed formulation
Pirfenex and the microsphere optimized formulation (F5) using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 1525, Massachusetts), with a slight
modification in the analytical method as previously reported.71 Briefly, analysis was performed using C18 column,
250 mm × 4.6 mm, particle size 5 μm (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Massachusetts), via isocratic elution mode with a mobile phase of
acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a ratio
of 35:65 (% v/v) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min using a photodiode array
detector at 310 nm. Liquid–liquid extraction technique (ethyl
acetate as extractive solvent) was adopted for the extraction of analytes
from biological matrix. The calibration curve of PFD in plasma was
plotted in the range of 100–3000 ng/mL with tinidazole (1500
ng/mL) as internal standard. The run time for each analysis was fixed
at 30 min and data acquisition was performed using Breeze software.

4.11.2 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
A single-dose
pharmacokinetic study was conducted on white albino rabbits with a
PFD equivalent dose of 15 mg/kg body weight. The rabbits were classified
into two groups (n = 3), group I (dosed with Pirfenex)
and group II (dosed with F5), using oral gastric intubation tube.
Blood samples (1 mL) were collected at predetermined time intervals
from marginal ear vein at 0 h (predose) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3,
4, 6, 9, and 12 h (postdose) in K3-EDTA vials (Peerless Biotech Pvt.
Ltd., Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India). The blood samples were centrifuged
for 10 min, and at −4 °C, plasma was separated and analyzed
using validated HPLC method as earlier described (Section 4.11.1). The pharmacokinetic
parameters were calculated using zero moment noncompartment pharmacokinetic
modeling.72 The procedure followed for
animal housing and handling is provided in Section S.4.11.2, Supporting Information.
