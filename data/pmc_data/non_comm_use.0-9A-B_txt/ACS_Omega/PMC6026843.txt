Aldehydes including formaldehyde,
acetaldehyde, and acrolein are
toxic organic components of air pollution that cause lung cancer and
cardiovascular disease with chronic exposure. The commonly used method
for determining the levels of carbonyl compounds based on the derivatizing
agent 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is of limited use for ketones and
unsaturated aldehydes because of issues such as low capture efficiencies,
unstable derivatives, and long sample collection times. This work
details the analysis of carbonyls in ambient air by a microreactor
approach. The microreactor is fabricated on a silicon wafer and has
thousands of micropillars in a microfluidic channel for uniformly
distributing the air flow through the channel. The surfaces of the
micropillars are coated with a quaternary ammonium aminooxy reagent,
2-(aminooxy)ethyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium iodide (ATM), for chemoselective capture of carbonyl
compounds by means of oximation reactions. ATM–carbonyl adducts
are eluted from the microreactor and directly analyzed by Fourier
transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and ultrahigh-performance
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. More than 20 carbonyls
were detected in ambient air samples. Acetone, 2-butanone, acetaldehyde,
and formaldehyde were the most abundant carbonyls in ambient air of
the studied urban areas.

Introduction
Carbonyl compounds
are common incomplete combustion products of
direct emissions from motor vehicles1−4 and chemical industrial plants and other
combustion sources,5,6 produced by the oxidation of virtually
all hydrocarbons, and formed by photochemical reactions of precursor
molecules with atmospheric ozone.7−10 Carbonyls in ambient air in urban and rural
areas and in emission gases from vehicles have been frequently monitored
and studied.11−16 Some carbonyls, notably formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein,
cause cardiovascular disease after chronic exposure.17 Consequently, the concentrations of these aldehydes in
the atmosphere are continuously monitored by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) under the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA)
program.18

The commonly used method
for the analysis of carbonyl compounds
in air is the EPA method TO-11A, which requires 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine
(DNPH)-coated solid sorbent cartridges.19 Carbonyls are collected as DNPH derivatives and the resultant DNPH–carbonyl
adducts are subsequently eluted and analyzed by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC).20−24 However, only a few studies have reported the carbonyl capture efficiency
of DNPH.25−27 In recent years, the TO-11A method has been reported
to have issues involving low capture efficiencies of ketones and problems
related to the formation of dimers and trimers with acrolein.28−31 Although collection of air samples in a mist chamber containing
an aqueous bisulfite solution followed by derivatization using pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine
(PFBHA) is an efficient method for acrolein determination, this approach
is not suitable for measuring formaldehyde and acetaldehyde because
of the low capture efficiencies of the mist chambers for these aldehydes.31−33 Solid-phase microextraction (SPME), a popular preconcentration method
introduced by Pawliszyn in the early 1990s,34 is a rapid extraction technique for the analysis of volatile organic
compounds from a variety of matrices. SPME, however, is only a semiquantitative
method because of competitive adsorption on the SPME fiber. Microfabricated
gas preconcentrators and gas chromatography columns have demonstrated
the potential for real-time gas detection.35−37 However, microfabricated
preconcentrators have low physical adsorption efficiencies and require
thermal desorption for the analyses of captured analytes.

The
objective of this work is to analyze carbonyls in environmental
air using silicon microreactors to capture trace carbonyls. The microreactors
have the advantage of overall small microliter volume and high surface
area because of thousands of micropillars coated with 2-(aminooxy)ethyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium
iodide (ATM), a quaternary ammonium aminooxy salt in comparison with
DNPH-based packed cartridges.38−41 ATM has fast reaction kinetics with both aldehydes
and ketones via oximation reactions and thus provides high carbonyl
capture efficiencies for both classes. Furthermore, a much smaller
volume of gaseous sample (∼1 L) is required for the analysis.
ATM imparts a permanent positive charge to all adducts and thus ensures
soft efficient ionization of the carbonyl analytes. In this work,
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS)
was initially used for rapid identification of volatile carbonyl adducts
because of its highest mass accuracy and resolution. Ultra HPLC–MS
(UHPLC–MS) was subsequently used for the separation and analysis
of isomeric ketones and aldehydes. The microreactors were used to
capture carbonyls from indoor and outdoor air samples collected during
sunny and rainy days in urban Louisville, Kentucky. More than 20 carbonyls
were detected, and their concentrations varied with weather and location.

Results
and Discussion
Characterizations of the microreactors and
measurements of capture
efficiencies of trace carbonyls in high-purity helium by the microreactors
have been reported.39 The capture efficiencies
of three aldehydes (propanal, butanal, and hexanal) and three ketones
(acetone, 2-butanone, and 2-pentanone) all reached above 92% using
the microreactors with ATM loaded in the microreactor at an ATM to
carbonyl molar ratio larger than 100:1 and at a sample flow rate of
5 mL/min through the microreactor. Increasing the sample flow rate
decreases the capture efficiencies of carbonyls. Thus, a fixed air
flow rate of 5 mL/min was used in this work. The microreactor was
also tested for the capture of acetone in a TO-15 standard with a
capture efficiency of 97%.39 Furthermore,
deuterated acetaldehyde, pentanal, acetone, and 2-butanone were spiked
into air and exhaled breath samples for the measurement of capture
efficiencies, and the results indicated that capture efficiencies
were not affected by relative humidity (RH) because of high excess
amount of ATM loaded in the microreactor and its fast reaction kinetics.

After the microreactors were characterized for the capture of carbonyl
compounds in high-purity helium and synthetic air, we began to use
the microreactors for the capture of carbonyls in ambient air. A typical
FT-ICR-MS spectrum of an air sample collected outdoors in urban Louisville
on a sunny day is shown in Figure S1. More
than 20 ATM adducts of carbonyls were detected in both outdoor and
indoor air samples. The ultrahigh mass resolution of FT-ICR-MS provides
a quick way to identify ATM–carbonyl adducts. Constitutionally
isomeric ketones and aldehydes are indistinguishable by direct infusion
FT-ICR-MS, but the measured m/z (molecular
weight) with the best mass resolution provides accurate molecular
formulas. Table 1 shows
the calculated mean concentrations of carbonyl compounds in air samples.
All concentrations in Table 1 were blank-corrected by subtraction of the mean field blank
values of the same carbonyls from the measurements, with resulting
negative values set to the nondetected (ND) level. All values were
included in the analysis, even if the concentration fell below the
method detection limit (MDL). A few other compounds including glyoxal
and tolualdehyde were detected in some outdoor samples but were not
included in the table. The air samples collected in 2017 were analyzed
by UHPLC–MS, and 13 compounds were identified. The concentrations
of acetone, propanal, 2-butanone, butanal, pentanone, and pentanal
were obtained from the air samples collected in 2017, while the concentrations
reported for all other carbonyls were measured mean values obtained
in 2012 and 2017. Hydroxyacetaldehyde, hydroxyacetone, and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone
were detected. Five formulae (C4H6O, C6H12O to C9H18O) in Table 1 were mixtures of isomeric aldehydes
and ketones that were not separated by UHPLC.

The concentrations
of carbonyl compounds obtained near a gas station
and at a roadside area about 2 miles away from the gas station (shown
in Figure S2) during sunny days were very
close with only slight differences for some compounds (Table 1). The total concentration of
all carbonyls near the gas station had a mean level of 51.6 μg/m3. The total concentration of all carbonyls at the roadside
area was 52.0 μg/m3 during sunny days and 16.9 μg/m3 during rainy days. Rain washes away carbonyl compounds in
air. Table 1 indicates
that acetone, 2-butanone acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde were the most
abundant carbonyl compounds in air. The total concentration of formaldehyde
and acetaldehyde counts for about 30% of all carbonyl compounds in
air at the roadside.

The total concentration of all carbonyls
in a chemistry laboratory
had a mean level of 55.3 μg/m3, slightly higher than
the total concentration outdoor during sunny days (Table 1). The concentrations of acetone,
2-butanone, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde in outdoor air are similar
to that in the chemistry laboratory. A comparison of the measurements
of these carbonyls in outdoor air during sunny days with an average
RH of 71% and rainy days with an average RH of 97% and in the chemistry
laboratory in Table 1 indicates that the environmental air in the area was polluted by
the carbonyls and that the weather affects carbonyl compound levels
in environmental air.

Table 2 lists the
concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, and
2-butanone in environmental air determined from this work and the
data reported in the literature. Formaldehyde in this work was similar
to the prior reports, but acetaldehyde was even higher than that measured
in New York23 and California.12 The level of acetone was near the highest level
reported in the literature (measured in Guangzhou, China21) and the level of 2-butanone was the highest
among all the reported data. One likely reason is air pollution from
the ever-expanding chemical industry in the city. Another possible
reason is that the acetone and 2-butanone levels, according to the
literature, were determined using DNPH-based methods, and these had
issues of low capture efficiencies.28 The
principal chemical industrial site in Louisville, known as Rubbertown
(shown in Figure S2), is in the southwest
end of the city. The area has a history of air pollution, and the
air quality has been monitored by the EPA. The average concentration
of acrolein was considerably lower than most of the published data
but was in the range of the data reported by Cahill.31 The capture efficiency of acrolein by the microreactor
was within the 50–60% range under the experimental conditions.
Therefore, the acrolein concentration measured by the microreactor
approach as reported in Table 2 is roughly half of the actual concentration.

The hourly average concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,
and acetone measured during daytime in July 2012 are shown in Figure 1. A slight
change in the concentrations, especially the concentrations of formaldehyde
and acetaldehyde, were observed at the roadside area over the 1 day
sampling period. During the sunny day (Figure 1a), the concentrations of formaldehyde and
acetaldehyde slightly increased from 8:00 to 10:00 because of emission
gases from vehicles during the morning traffic peak. The concentrations
then decreased from 10:00 to 12:00, followed by a slight increase
from 12:00 to 18:00, reaching a maximum at 18:00 once again because
of the traffic. Photochemical reactions also contribute to the total
formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations observed during the mid-day.
The carbonyl concentrations on rainy days were much lower than those
observed during sunny days (Figure 1b). The concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
in both sunny and rainy days slightly increased from 8:00 to 10:00
because of traffic emission.

This work demonstrated that the
microreactor approach is suitable
for the analysis of carbonyls in ambient air. The present approach
has several advantages over current methods11,12,20−24,31−33 for the collection and analysis of carbonyls in air including small
air sample size (<1 L), microfluidic solvent volume (∼7
μL) for adduct elution from the microreactor, and the permanent
positive charge imparted by ATM for increasing the sensitivity of
MS analysis. Deuterated carbonyl compounds can be added into air samples
for monitoring the capture efficiencies and measurement accuracy.
The approach is convenient for monitoring carbonyls in environmental
air at specific times as shown in Figure 1. High capture efficiencies of both saturated
aldehydes and ketones make the microreactor approach suitable for
the analysis of these carbonyls (Table 2). The limitation of the microreactors is a relatively
low sample flow rate (<10 mL/min) in order to achieve high capture
efficiencies. Finally, depending on column elution conditions, UHPLC
may not cleanly separate isomeric ketones and aldehydes, particularly
for carbonyls with more than five carbon atoms. To further improve
this microreactor approach, we aim to develop new derivatizing agents
for the microreactor to capture unsaturated aldehydes, particularly
acrolein, with higher capture efficiencies for accurate analyses of
such aldehydes.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All
reagents and solvents, including formaldehyde,
acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, methanol, deuterated acetaldehyde,
and acetone (acetone-d6) (99.9%), were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). The quaternary ammonium
aminooxy compound ATM was synthesized according to a published method.42 Tedlar bags were purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte,
PA). Syringes (0.5 L, clear acrylic, purchased from SGE, Orlando,
FL) and 1 L size Tedlar bags were cleaned with high-purity nitrogen
and tested free of carbonyl compound contamination. Stainless steel
canisters (6 L size) for the collection of air samples were purchased
from Restek Corporation (Bellefonte, PA).

Microreactor Fabrication
The microreactors were fabricated
using the techniques common for the fabrication of microelectromechanical
system devices. The fabrication procedures are standard processes
that take about 1 week to complete.38−40Figure 2A shows a microreactor chip having inlet
and outlet ports connected to 360 μm O.D., 250 μm I.D.
deactivated fused silica tubes. Figure 2B shows an optical micrograph of the micropillar array
within the microreactor, and Figure 2C shows a scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) micrograph
of the micropillars. The surface coating of the micropillars using
ATM was done by flowing a known amount (3.65 × 10–7 mol) of ATM–iodide salt in methanol (15 μL) into the
microreactor channel through one connection port, followed by evaporation
of methanol using a vacuum oven. The slightly negative charge of the
silicon dioxide surface of the micropillars enhances association between
ATM cations and the surfaces of the micropillars. ATM on the surface
of the micropillars reacts with carbonyls via oximation reactions.

Air Sample Collection and
Concentration
Ambient air
samples from indoor areas (university facilities) and outdoor areas
(roadside, gas station) in urban Louisville, Kentucky, were collected
using a 0.5 L size syringe to fill Tedlar bags. Initially, the measurements
of carbonyl compounds in air samples collected in Tedlar bags were
compared with measurements of air samples collected in stainless steel
canisters. The Tedlar bags were free of carbonyl compound contamination
after cleaning three times with high-purity nitrogen, followed by
evacuation each time. There was no statistically significant difference
between measured concentrations of carbonyls for the samples collected
in Tedlar bags versus canisters. Therefore, all air samples were collected
in Tedlar bags. After sample collection, a 1 L air sample in a Tedlar
bag was connected to the microreactor in the laboratory at an ambient
temperature of 20 °C as shown in Figure S3. The air sample was passed through the microreactor at a flow rate
of 5 mL/min. The ATM–carbonyl adducts and unreacted ATM were
then eluted from the microreactor by flowing methanol (150 μL)
from one slightly pressurized vial through the microreactor and into
an empty collection vial. The eluted solutions were directly used
for either FT-ICR-MS or UHPLC–MS analysis without further processing.
To determine the concentrations of the carbonyl compounds, a 5 μL
solution containing 1.14 × 10–8 mol of acetone-d6 completely reacted with ATM in methanol was
added to each eluted methanol solution as an internal reference (IR)
for quantitative analysis by FT-ICR-MS and UHPLC–MS. The amounts
of captured carbonyl compounds were determined by using calibration
curves of the known concentrations of ATM–carbonyl adduct solutions
versus the intensity ratios of the ATM–carbonyl to the IR ATM–acetone-d6 adduct for FT-ICR-MS analyses. The calibration
curves of UHPLC–MS were built by the known concentrations of
ATM–carbonyl adduct in methanol versus the ratios of the peak
area of the ATM–carbonyl to the peak area of the IR ATM-acetone-d6. The samples collected in July 2012 were analyzed
only by FT-ICR-MS because no UHPLC–MS was available in-house
at the time. Although high-resolution FT-ICR-MS was used for quick
identification of carbonyls, other lower resolution mass spectrometers
can be used for the analysis. The samples collected in July 2017 were
analyzed by UHPLC–MS for the separation of isomeric compounds.
ATM–carbonyl adducts stored as methanol solutions in a refrigerator
were stable for at least 1 month.

Quality Assurance
The capture efficiencies of ketones
and aldehydes by the ATM-coated microreactors have been characterized
and published.38−40 Saturated ketones and aldehydes were captured with
efficiencies above 95%. Deuterated acetaldehyde, 2-butanone, and pentanal
were also added to air samples for verifying the capture efficiencies
of these compounds. The capture efficiencies of aldehydes were slightly
higher than those of isomeric ketones because of faster reaction kinetics.
Field blanks were defined as the average of measurements of individual
carbonyls from three microreactors loaded with ATM without any active
flow of air but eluted with methanol. These field blanks were then
used as background contamination of carbonyls. The MDLs of ATM–carbonyl
adducts were defined as the mean field blanks plus three standard
deviations of the field blanks. At least three duplicate air samples
were collected and analyzed for each location, and the average concentrations
were reported.

FT-ICR-MS and UHPLC–MS Analyses
The eluted methanol
solutions containing the ATM–carbonyl adducts were analyzed
on a hybrid linear ion trap FT-ICR-MS instrument (Finnigan LTQ-FT,
Thermo Electron, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate
ion source (Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY) with an electrospray chip
(nozzle inner diameter 5.5 μm). The TriVersa NanoMate was operated
in a positive ion mode by applying 2.0 kV with no head pressure. The
LTQ-FT was tuned and calibrated according to the manufacturer’s
default standard recommendations, which achieved better than 1 ppm
mass accuracy and a 400 000 resolution capability at m/z of 400. ATM and ATM derivative species were assigned
on the basis of their accurate mass by first applying a small (typically
<0.0005) linear correction based on the observed mass of the internal
standard.

For the separation of isomeric ATM–carbonyl
adducts, the eluted solutions were injected into a Vanquish UHPLC
system fitted with a Syncronis HILIC column (2.1 mm × 100 mm,
1.7 μm) (Thermo Fisher, USA). Elution was performed using a
95/5% mixture of acetonitrile/100 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution
(pH = 3). The column was thermostatized at 30 °C, and the chromatographic
flow rate was set to 0.4 mL/min. The eluent from the column was introduced
into an electrospray ionization source (3.5 kV). Ions were introduced
into a Q Exactive Focus Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA)
mass spectrometer working at a resolution of 35 000 at m/z of 400.
