Herein, a promising near-infrared-responsive
photothermal agent
was designed by anchoring of rice grain-shaped ZnO particles over
graphene (GR) nanosheets and subsequent sensitization with cobalt
phthalocyanine (CoPc). Thus, produced GR–ZnO–CoPc was
able to attain the temperature of 68 °C by irradiating to 980
nm laser for 7 min, which is extremely higher than the endurance temperature
of cancer cells. The linear fashioned progression in the photothermal
effect of GR nanosheets was conquered by immobilization of ZnO particles
and successive sensitization with CoPc. The excellence found in the
photothermal effect of GR–ZnO–CoPc was verified by estimation
of its photothermal conversion efficiency. The photothermal conversion
efficiency assessed for GR–ZnO–CoPc was higher than
those for the popular gold- and CuS-based photothermal agents. In
addition, it possessed significant stability against photobleaching
and structural rupture. It was found that the photothermal effect
of GR–ZnO–CoPc is proportional to its concentration.
However, by replacement of a 980 nm laser system with 808 nm, the
photothermal effect of GR–ZnO–CoPc was reduced, which
could be due to lower absorption of GR–ZnO–CoPc at 808
nm compared to 980 nm. On account of its significance and important
properties, GR–ZnO–CoPc could be an interesting photothermal
agent to employ in future photothermal therapy for cancer.

1 Introduction
Cancer
is a current major cause for morbidity and mortality in
humans. The main feature of cancer tissues is the decreased level
of oxygen called hypoxia, and it leads to proliferation, angiogenesis,
and metastasis of cancer cells.1 For cancer
therapy, different therapeutic modalities have been employed, in which
the mainstream approaches are surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.2 However, these therapies are associated with
a number of disadvantages, such as damaging of healthy tissues, attacking
of immune system, invasive, toxic side effects, poor tumor-selectivity,
and limited efficacy.2 Therefore, advanced
therapies having high efficiency and precision are critically needed
for cancer. One of the promising therapies is hyperthermia in which
cancer cells are selectively targeted and destroyed by exposing to
near-infrared (NIR)-mediated high temperature. Hyperthermia can destroy
cancer cells in a selective manner, and a gifted approach for hyperthermia
to deliver NIR-facilitated thermal energy to ablate cancer cells is
photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT is an innovative method in cancer
therapy, and it relies on conversion efficiency of photon energy into
heat through a photosensitizer called a photothermal agent under illumination
of NIR light. Irradiation of a photothermal agent injected in cancer
cells by NIR laser leads to rapid rise in the local cellular temperature
above the threshold value beyond 50 °C for 4–6 min of
period or over 42–45 °C (a mild hyperthermia condition)
with 15–60 min to cause denaturation of protein, disruption
of the cellular membrane, and ablation of cancer cells.3 In other words, PTT is a distinct phototherapy
that results in damaging of cancer cells owing to heat generated by
the photosensitizer by absorption of NIR light radiations.2 So that, the photosensitizer is the key factor
to succeed in PTT. Recently, a range of nanomaterials have been discovered
and explored as photosensitizers for PTT.3 Among various photothermal agents, graphene (GR) holds critical
importance due to its distinctive physical and chemical properties.4,5 GR possess two-dimensional (2D) one-atom-thickness with a honeycomb
structure of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms.4 In addition, GR consists of elevated electron transport
aptitude at room temperature, excellent elasticity and thermal conductivity,
high mechanical strength, tunable optical properties, quantum Hall
effect at room temperature, high effective surface area, and tunable
band gap.4 Since its revolutionary discovery
in 2004 by Geim and Novoselov,6 GR is massively
explored in the areas of catalysis, sensing, energy, and electrical
and electronics applications.7−10 However, it has been least probed in the biomedical
area despite its excellent biocompatibility. In particular, potential
use of GR in PTT is still under nascent stage and limited. GR introduced
in cancer cells can derive its vibrational modes into thermal energy
after irradiating to NIR radiations, cause a rise in temperature around
the cancerous tissue, and structurally change their cellular and protein
configurations, and cause the ablation.2,4 Therefore,
it is currently critically needed to evaluate the possibilities of
GR in PTT.

Another important material that has equal importance
like GR is
ZnO.11 ZnO is an important n-type semiconductor
and has a direct wide band gap of 3.37 eV and strong exciton binding
energy of 60 meV.12,13 Moreover, ZnO exhibits excellent
optical activity, good stability, and high electron mobility of 200–300
cm2 V–1 s–1.12,14 ZnO is inherently nonhazardous to mammalian cells owing to its chemical
inertness and stability under physiological conditions. However, ZnO
can cause cytotoxic effects in cancer cells and destroy them.11 Hence, ZnO could be a promising candidate for
the next-generation biomedical applications, and it has been broadly
executed as a nanocarrier for various biomolecules.15,16 However, UV emission connected with excitonic band edge and visible
emission attributed with sundry intrinsic defects of ZnO has restricted
its use merely to UV and visible radiations.17 Hence, to modify the response of ZnO toward NIR radiations, it is
crucial to conjugate it with a secondary candidate such as GR. Owing
to the distinct properties of GR, its combination with ZnO can prolong
the ability of ZnO to absorb NIR radiations. With this emphasis, herein,
ZnO was blended with GR and succeeded in extending the absorption
of ZnO toward the NIR region.12,14 So far, application
of ZnO in PTT is still at a budding stage, so, execution of possible
employment of ZnO in PTT is absolutely needed.

Phthalocyanines
(Pcs) are an important class of organic semiconductors
as they behave as photosensitizers.18−22 Pcs are known as second-generation photosensitizers,
having exceptional photostability and act as p-type semiconductors.23 Pcs hold extended absorption wavelengths (λmax > 660 nm), high extinction coefficients (εmax > 105 L mol–1 cm–1), exceptional thermal stability, and variable photophysical and
photochemical properties.21 Furthermore,
the absorption of Pcs in the NIR region is particularly important
as it takes the benefit of spectral concurrence with the tissue-transparent
window, where minimal photon interferences (absorption, autofluorescence,
and scattering) from solvents, biomolecules, and the biological matrix
allow for deeper light penetration and minimum invasiveness.24 Moreover, Pcs exhibit low dark toxicity and
strong phototoxicity because of their capability to produce cytotoxic
reactive oxygen species, specially singlet oxygen.24 Owing to their aptitude in generation of singlet oxygen
(1O2) by irradiating to light, Pcs are approved
by US Food and Drug Administration for clinical applications in cancer
therapy.18 However, Pcs have been least
employed in PTT owing to their hydrophobic nature that causes poor
selectivity, solubility, and transportation of Pcs into cancer cells.
Thus, to overcome this major defect of Pcs, their integration with
other innovative materials such as ZnO and GR might be the right approach.
Therefore, in consideration of their unique benefits, herein, we successfully
merged GR, ZnO, and cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) by deposition of
rice grain-shaped ZnO microparticles over GR nanosheets and subsequent
sensitization with CoPc. Thus prepared GR–ZnO–CoPc has
demonstrated significant photothermal effect (PTE) required for PTT
of cancer. Overall, a methodical augmentation in the PTE of GR was
achieved by deposition of ZnO particles on its surfaces and successively
sensitizing with CoPc.

2 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of GR–ZnO (Figure 1a) depicted the characteristic
reflection of GR nanosheets at 2θ value of 26.2° corresponding
to (0 0 2). In addition, it displayed the reflections of ZnO at 31.78°,
34.4°, 36.2°, 47.6°, 56.6°, 62.9°, 68.0°,
and 69.0° owing to (1 0 0), (0 0 2), (1 0 1), (1 0 2), (1 1 0),
(1 0 3), (1 1 2), and (2 0 1) reflection planes of ZnO (JCPDS file
no. 36-1451). The pattern of GR–ZnO–CoPc (Figure 1b) illustrated the diffraction
peaks ascribed to both GR and ZnO, in addition to peaks corresponding
to CoPc at 7.0°, 9.3°, 23.8°, 33.1°, and 40.4°
(JCPDS file no. 44-1994). It reveals the successful preparation of
GR–ZnO and its sensitization with CoPC. To further characterize,
attenuated total reflection (ATR)–IR spectra were employed.
The spectrum of GR–ZnO (Figure 2a) displayed a band at 1491 cm–1 due
to the skeletal vibration of GR and additional broad absorption band
at 3195 cm–1 by stretching vibrations of hydroxyl
groups of water molecules absorbed over the surface of GR–ZnO.
However, the spectrum of GR–ZnO–CoPc (Figure 2b) demonstrated the essential
characteristic peaks of the Pc moiety, in which, the bands at 730,
754, and 779 cm–1 were consigned to aromatic ring
of benzene. In particular, the band at 730 cm–1 is
owing to nonplanar deformation vibrations of C–H bonds, whereas
the bands found at 754 and 779 cm–1 were due to
nonplanar vibrations (out-of-plane bending) of C–H bonds of
the benzene ring. The metal to ligand (M–N) vibration of CoPc
was perceived at 911 cm–1. The absorptions present
at 1086 and 1118 cm–1 were due to C–N stretching
and C–H in-plane bending vibrations, respectively, of CoPc.25 The pyrrole C–C stretching tied-up with
aza rocking was displayed at 1331 cm–1, and C–H
deformation was observed at 1288 cm–1.26 The band at 1424 cm–1 was
due to C–C benzene ring skeletal stretching vibrations, and
the band at 1521 cm–1 was due to stretching of the
pyrrole ring.26

and (b) GR–ZnO–CoPc.

The surface morphology accessed
by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) provided the distinct visibility of the presence
of GR nanosheets and ZnO particles in GR–ZnO (Figure 3a,b). The rice grain-shaped
ZnO microparticles are strongly adhered over the corrugated and scrolled
GR nanosheets. The intimate interaction between GR nanosheets and
elongated ZnO particles is obviously identifiable in Figure 3a,b, and it facilitates rapid
transfer of photo-generated charge carriers to improve the photosensitive
activity of GR–ZnO. In GR–ZnO, ZnO particles are randomly
oriented over the smooth and wrinkled surfaces of GR nanosheets. The
ZnO particles have hollow interior of about 100 nm diameter and irregular
surface morphology (Figure 3b). Nonetheless, the surface morphology of GR–ZnO was
not influenced by sensitizing it with CoPc (Figure 3c). Hence, the surface morphology of GR–ZnO
is identical in GR–ZnO–CoPc also (Figure 3c). The existence of densely populated ZnO
particles on the surface of GR nanosheets is perceptible in GR–ZnO–CoPc.
However, existence of CoPc is unidentifiable in GR–ZnO–CoPc,
which could be due to low concentration of CoPc. To identify sensitization
of GR–ZnO with CoPc in detail, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) was implemented. The EDS of GR–ZnO (Figure S1) indicated the occurrence of C, Zn, O, and Cu. Among
these, C is originated by GR nanosheets, and Zn and O are owing to
ZnO particles. In addition, GR–ZnO exhibited the presence of
Cu because of the copper sample holder used in the EDS measurement.
The EDS of GR–ZnO–CoPc (Figure S2) demonstrated the peak corresponding to Co apart from C, Zn, and
O. To further authenticate the sensitization of GR–ZnO with
CoPc, elemental mapping was carried out. The element mapping images
of GR–ZnO–CoPc, shown in Figure 4a–d verify the content of C, Zn, O,
and Co and their uniform distribution all over the sample. The dispersal
of O corresponds well with elemental Zn, and it is in accordance with
elemental C and Co mapping. The element mapping reveals uniform distribution
of ZnO and CoPc on the GR nanosheets, and the element mapping of GR–ZnO–CoPc
is in compliance with its EDS.

(c) GR–ZnO–CoPc.

Figure 4 Element mapping images of GR–ZnO–CoPc.

The surface morphology of GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc
was further examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
the obtained images are depicted in Figure 5a,b, respectively. The manifestation of GR
nanosheets and ZnO particles are noticeable in the image of GR–ZnO
(Figure 5a). The scrambled
nature of GR nanosheets and their close contact and strong interaction
with ZnO particles is observable in GR–ZnO. The ZnO particles
possess zigzag fashioned edges and a nonuniform surface, whereas the
GR nanosheets have a uniform and smooth surface. The 2D nature of
GR nanosheets is apparent in the image of GR–ZnO–CoPc
(Figure 5b) as these
sheets have several microns of length and width, and about 7–8
nm of thickness. Owing to their nanometer thickness, the GR nanosheets
appear like a silky wave having absolute transparency. The ZnO particles
are immobilized over the GR nanosheet, and the incidence of CoPc is
visible in GR–ZnO–CoPc. In Figure 5b, existence of a single GR nanosheet is
distinctly visible, and it demonstrates that the deposition of ZnO
particles and sensitization with CoPc has successfully prohibited
the bundling of GR nanosheets in GR–ZnO–CoPc.

of (a) GR–ZnO and (b) GR–ZnO–CoPc.

The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) scrutinized
the chemical
composition and potential structure of GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc
(Figure 6). The survey
spectra of GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc presented in Figure 6a exhibited the characteristics
peaks corresponding to C, Zn, and O. These elements have been precisely
accessed through their high resolution spectra. The spectrum of C
1s (Figure 6b) provided
the characteristic peak at 287.2 and 287.1 eV for GR–ZnO and
GR–ZnO–CoPc, respectively. This peak of C 1s is assigned
to C–C and C=O bonds of the GR nanosheets.27 However, the spectrum of Zn 2p (Figure 6c) was fragmented into two
distinctive energy levels, viz., Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 situated at 1025.2 and 1048.0 eV, respectively, in GR–ZnO,
and at 1024.8 and 1048.0 eV, respectively, in GR–ZnO–CoPc.
The energy value corresponding to the spin–orbital coupling
was estimated for the fragmentation of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn
2p1/2 peaks, and it was found to be 22.8 and 23.2 eV for
GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc, respectively.28 It represents the presence of Zn atoms with
their oxidation state of +2 in GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc.
In particular, the peak displayed around 1025 eV is accompanied with
Zn2+ present in wurtzite-structured ZnO. The spectrum of
O 1s region (Figure 6d) depicts the peak with the binding energy of 534.8 eV in both GR–ZnO
and GR–ZnO–CoPc by oxygen ions of ZnO.29 Accordingly, the intense peaks found for Zn 2p and O 1s
regions in Figure 6a reveal the occurrence of Zn2+ and O2– in the formation of bonds between the Zn and O ions of ZnO present
in GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc. The presence of the
peak corresponding to Co 2p around 780 eV is barely detectable in
the spectrum of GR–ZnO–CoPc, which could be owing to
low concentration of CoPc in the sample. However, GR–ZnO–CoPc
displayed the peak of N 1s at 401.2 eV (Figure 6e), which originates from the Pc moiety of
CoPc present in GR–ZnO–CoPc. Compared to GR–ZnO,
position of the peaks was not significantly varied in GR–ZnO–CoPc;
it suggests that sensitization of GR–ZnO with CoPc did not
modify the inherent structure of GR–ZnO.

of GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc
and high resolution spectra of (b) C 1s, (c) Zn 2p, (d) O 1s, and
(e) N 1s.

The NIR response of GR–ZnO
and GR–ZnO–CoPc
was preliminarily estimated using UV–vis–NIR spectra
(Figure 7). The spectrum
of GR–ZnO (Figure 7a) provided an electronic absorption band at 270 nm, corresponding
to π → π* transitions of aromatic C–C bonds
present in the GR nanosheets.25 Additional,
important absorption was revealed at 375 nm, which is consistent with
the characteristic absorption of ZnO.12,25 Therefore,
the spectrum of GR–ZnO advises the presence of GR and ZnO.
Furthermore, it disclosed the band between 930 and 1050 nm and validated
its higher absorption of aqueous dispersion of GR–ZnO in the
NIR region. The spectrum of GR–ZnO–CoPc (Figure 7b) revealed the absorption
bands analogue to GR and ZnO at 275 and 370 nm, respectively. The
absorption owing to CoPc was not observed in GR–ZnO–CoPc,
which could be because of minute concentration of CoPc. However, a
slight shifting in the bands related to GR and ZnO has been found
in GR–ZnO–CoPc compared to GR–ZnO. It could be
due to variation in the electronic absorption of GR–ZnO caused
by the manifestation of CoPc in GR–ZnO–CoPc. However,
GR–ZnO–CoPc revealed its predominant activity under
exposure to NIR radiations by exhibiting substantial absorption in
the NIR region.

Figure 7 UV–vis–NIR spectra of (a) GR–ZnO
and (b) GR–ZnO–CoPc.

In consideration of their substantial
absorption in the NIR region,
PTE of GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc was measured by
irradiating their aqueous dispersion to 980 nm laser and compared
with that of water, GR nanosheets, and ZnO particles. Figure 8 illustrates the PTE of the
samples determined under identical experimental conditions at their
concentration of 1 g/mL. The temperature recorded during measurement
of PTE is summarized in Table 1. By continuous illumination to laser for 7 min, temperature
of water increased from 22.8 to 31.1 °C with total difference
(ΔT) of 8.3 °C. Whereas ΔT found for ZnO particles was 23.7 °C, that is 22.8–46.5
°C. The elevation in temperature measured for GR nanosheets was
from 22.6 to 51.3 °C, with an estimated ΔT of 28.7 °C. Interestingly, by conjugation of GR nanosheets
and ZnO particles, their PTE was significantly enhanced in GR–ZnO
compared to their individual values. In detail, GR–ZnO exhibited
ΔT of 36.4 °C with initial and final temperatures
of 22.9 and 59.3 °C, respectively. The PTE of GR nanosheets and
ZnO particles was enhanced by 7.7 and 12.7 °C, respectively,
after their conjugation in GR–ZnO. The improvement found in
the PTE of GR nanosheets and ZnO particles after their conjugation
was accounted for by the heterojunctioned structure formed between
them in GR–ZnO. In case of GR–ZnO–CoPc, an increase
of 44.9 °C was recognized from 22.8 to 67.7 °C, so PTE of
GR–ZnO was further improved by sensitizing with CoPc. The advancement
of 8.5 °C found in GR–ZnO–CoPc compared to GR–ZnO
was accounted for by the presence of CoPc. Overall, a systematical
improvement in the PTE of the GR nanosheets and ZnO particles is achieved
by their perfect combination and subsequent sensitization with CoPc.
The advancement in the PTE of GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc
was precisely estimated through estimation of their photothermal conversion
efficiency (η) by means of Roper’s method using eq 1(30−33) 1  where η is the photothermal efficiency, h is heat-transfer coefficient, and S is
the surface area of the sample container. Tmax is the maximum temperature attained by the sample, and Tsurr is the surrounding temperature. The values of these
parameters are provided in Table 2. I is power of the laser source (2000
mW), and A980 is absorbance of aqueous
dispersion of samples at excitation of 980 nm. Qdis is rate of heat dissipated owing to absorption of light
by solvent and container.

To evaluate the value of hS, a dimensionless
driving
force of temperature, θ, was introduced and scaled using the
maximum system temperature, Tmax and the
surrounding temperature, Tsurr. 2  

and the sample system time
constant, τs, was determined
by eq 3 3  

The value of τs was estimated by Figures S3 and S4, and
it was found to be 347 and 346 s for
GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc, respectively. Using the
value of τs, the unknown parameter, hS was calculated by eq 4. 4  where mD (1.01
g) is mass of deionized (DI) water, and CD is its heat capacity. The value of Qdis was measured separately using a quartz cuvette containing only DI
water without any sample, and it was found to be 25.9 mW.

The
photothermal conversion efficiency (η) calculated for
GR–ZnO was found to be 25%. This value of η estimated
for GR–ZnO containing rice grain-shaped ZnO microparticles
was found to be lower than the value determined for GR–ZnO
having trapezoid-shaped ZnO nanoparticles (49%).14 Therefore, photothermal conversion efficiency is controlled
by morphology of ZnO particles, and the value of η can be tuned
by varying the morphology of ZnO particles.

The photothermal
conversion efficiency of GR–ZnO was improved
after sensitizing with CoPc. Hence, the value of η estimated
for GR–ZnO–CoPc was 32%, which is 7% higher than the
efficiency of GR–ZnO. It shows that combination of CoPc with
GR–ZnO can increase its absorbing aptitude to NIR radiations
and result in enhancement of photothermal conversion efficiency. Therefore,
sensitizing with CoPc could be an ideal modality to improve PTE of
GR–ZnO. However, the photothermal conversion efficiency determined
for both GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc were comparatively
greater than the value estimated for well-known photothermal agents,
viz., Au nanoshells (18%),34 Au nanorods
(22%),35 and Cu2–xSe nanoparticles (22%).36 Generally,
the temperature forbearance of cancer cells is about 50 °C,37,38 whereas the maximum temperature attained with GR–ZnO and
GR–ZnO–CoPc during the measurement of their PTE was
59.3 and 67.7 °C, respectively. The temperature attained by GR–ZnO
and GR–ZnO–CoPc is beyond the survival temperature of
cancer cells. Hence, both GR–ZnO and GR–ZnO–CoPc
would be able to generate sufficient heat needed to ablate cancer
cells.

To analyze the stability of GR–ZnO–CoPc,
it was applied
in five cycles of PTE measurement and the PTE was almost constant
in all five cycles (Figure S5). In addition,
XRD of GR–ZnO–CoPc recorded after employing it in five
cycles could not show any considerable modification compared to the
unused GR–ZnO–CoPc (Figure S6). Hence, GR–ZnO–CoPc possesses excellent stability
against both photobleaching and structural rupture. Apart from this,
the influence of concentration over PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc
was identified by measuring at additional lower concentrations of
0.5 and 0.25 g/mL and it was recognized that the PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc
was directly related to its concentration (Figure S7). The calculated values of ΔT for
GR–ZnO–CoPc at its concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and
1 g/mL were 28.7, 37.5, and 44.9 °C, respectively. In detail,
ΔT estimated between 0.25 and 0.5 g/mL was
9 °C and it was 7.4 °C between 0.5 and 1 g/mL. Furthermore,
the impact of the NIR laser source over PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc
was revealed by replacing the 980 nm laser system with an 808 nm laser.
It was found that PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc was reduced under
irradiation to 808 nm laser compared to 980 nm laser (Figure S8). The reduction that occurred in the
PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc under irradiation to 808 nm laser
could be explained by its UV–vis–NIR spectrum shown
in Figure 7b as it
possesses low absorbance at 808 nm compared to 980 nm, which reduced
the PTE with 808 nm laser.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a promising photothermal agent, GR–ZnO–CoPc
was designed by deposition of rice grain-shaped ZnO particles over
GR nanosheets and successive sensitization with CoPc. The PTE of GR–ZnO
was considerably improved by its sensitization with CoPc. The hybrid
structure formed between GR nanosheets, ZnO particles, and CoPc transpired
an exceptional PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc. The sequential enhancement
in the PTE of GR nanosheets was successfully attained by immobilization
of ZnO over their surfaces and sensitization of CoPc. The value of
the photothermal conversion efficiency estimated for GR–ZnO–CoPc
was experimentally verified to show its effectiveness as a promising
NIR active photothermal agent. The GR–ZnO–CoPc demonstrated
higher photothermal conversion efficiency than well-known gold- and
copper-based photothermal agents. Apart from its excellent PTE, GR–ZnO–CoPc
demonstrated strong resistance against photobleaching and structural
rupture. The PTE of GR–ZnO–CoPc was directly related
to its concentration, and it was reduced by replacement of 980 nm
laser system with 808 nm laser. The temperature attained by GR–ZnO–CoPc
during measurement of PTE was absolutely excessive than survival temperature
level of cancer cells. Therefore, on account of its excellence, GR–ZnO–CoPc
could be classified as a brilliant photothermal agent to apply in
future PTT.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The chemicals employed
in the experiments were received from Sigma-Aldrich and were used
without any further purification. For preparation of aqueous solutions,
ultrapure water generated by Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore) was used.

4.2 Preparation of GR–ZnO
The
GR–ZnO was prepared according to ref (25), in which GR oxide (GO)
(40 mg) prepared by the Hummers and Offeman method with few variations39,40 was dispersed in DI water (25 mL) by sonication for 5 min. Then,
20 mL aqueous solution of ZnCl2 (0.01 mol) was added, and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min under ambient conditions.
Subsequently, 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate (2 mL) was slowly added, and
the reaction was proceeded for 1 h at room temperature. The resultant
GR–ZnO was obtained by centrifugation and purifying by sequential
washings with DI water.

4.3 Preparation of GR–ZnO–CoPc
GR–ZnO (20 mg) was dispersed by sonication in 25 mL of DI
water, and a solution of 2 mg of CoPc in 5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide was
gradually added. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 h at room
temperature, and thus formed GR–ZnO–CoPc was extracted
by centrifugation and subsequently washed with DI water followed by
its drying in vacuum.

4.4 Preparation of ZnO Particles
and GR Nanosheets
For control experiments, ZnO particles
and GR nanosheets were prepared;
among these, the ZnO particles were synthesized by the method referred
for GR–ZnO without using GO, and the GR nanosheets were produced
by the reduction of GO.41

4.5 Photothermal Effect
PTE of the samples
was estimated by 980 and 808 nm NIR lasers (Armlaser Inc. USA) having
output power of 2 W/cm2. For all samples, 1 mL aqueous
dispersion in a quartz cuvette was irradiated with NIR laser. The
resulting elevation in temperature facilitated by irradiation was
recorded with Hanna precision digital thermometer (model: HI93510)
carrying the thermocouple immersed in sample.

4.6 Characterization
To acquire FESEM
images, a JEOL JXA-8900 microscope was used, and for TEM images and
EDS, a JEOL 2010 microscope was utilized. To get XPS and XRD patterns,
a PerkinElmer PHI 5600 ci X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and Scintag
X-ray diffractometer (PAD X) fitted with Cu Kα photon source
(45 kV, 40 mA), respectively, were employed. The UV–vis–NIR
electronic absorption and ATR–IR spectra were perceived by
a Varian Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer and Smiths ChemID diamond ATR
spectrometer, respectively.
