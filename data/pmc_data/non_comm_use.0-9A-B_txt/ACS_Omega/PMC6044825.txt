In recent years, many bacteria have
developed resistance to commonly
used antibiotics. It is well-known that calcium is essential for bacterial
function and cell wall stability. Bisphosphonates (BPs) have high
affinity to calcium ions and are effective calcium chelators. Therefore,
BPs could potentially be used as antibacterial agents. This article
provides a detailed description regarding the synthesis of a unique
BP vinylic monomer MA-Glu-BP (methacrylate glutamate bisphosphonate)
and polyMA-Glu-BP nanoparticles (NPs) for antibacterial applications.
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were synthesized by dispersion copolymerization
of the MA-Glu-BP monomer with the primary amino monomer N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMA) and the cross-linker
monomer tetra ethylene glycol diacrylate, to form cross-linked NPs
with a narrow size distribution. The size and size distribution of
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were controlled by changing various polymerization
parameters. Near-infrared fluorescent polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were prepared
by covalent binding of the dye cyanine7 N-hydroxysuccinimide
to the primary amino groups belonging to the APMA monomeric units
on the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs. The affinity of the near-infrared fluorescent
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs toward calcium was demonstrated in vitro by a coral
model. Cytotoxicity, cell uptake, and antibacterial properties of
the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs against two common bacterial pathogens representing
Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two
representing Gram-positive bacteria, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus, were then
demonstrated.

1 Introduction
Bacteria play a major
role in causing acute and chronic infections.1,2 Since
the discovery, in 1929, of penicillin by Alexander Fleming,3 antibiotics have been the preferred treatment
for bacterial infections. Unfortunately, in recent years, many bacteria
have developed resistance to commonly used antibiotics.1 Therefore, new effective antibiotics are needed.2 One possible antibacterial strategy is to reduce
the calcium levels, which are essential for the function of bacteria.

Calcium ion forms divalent cation bridges with negatively charged
functional groups on the cell wall, which increases bacterial cell
stability.4,5 Calcium also plays an important role in
the function of various intracellular proteins in bacteria.6,7 For example, calcium takes part in the signal transduction of bacteria.8

Polyphosphates have been shown to possess
antibacterial activity9−12 due to their ability to form metal complexes with cations such as
calcium.13,14 Polyphosphates are a polymeric multiphosphorous
class of compounds bearing a P–O–P repeating unit. Endogenous
pyrophosphate is the smallest polyphosphate (Figure 1).15

Figure 1 Pyrophosphate
and BP structures.

Bisphosphonates (BPs)
are a group of stable organic analogues of
the pyrophosphate (Figure 1). BPs have high affinity to calcium and are known as effective
calcium chelators.16−24 Considering the similarity of BPs to polyphosphates, they could
be used as antibacterial agents.25

Nanoparticles (NPs) are spherical macromolecules with a diameter
of 1–100 nm26 and are being widely
studied for their potential as antibacterial drugs.27,28 Because of their small size, NPs have a relatively large surface-area-to-mass
ratio, thus enabling the NPs to interact with the bacterial cell wall
without penetrating the cell.29,30 It has been previously
demonstrated that NPs can be active against both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria.31

In this
work, the synthesis of the novel BP compounds N-phthaloyl
glutamate bisphosphonate (N-Pht-Glu-BP),
gamma glutamate bisphosphonate (γ-Glu-BP), and MA-Glu-BP (methacrylate
glutamate bisphosphonate) is reported. PolyMA-Glu-BP NPs were then
synthesized by copolymerization of the novel MA-Glu-BP monomer with
two commercially available monomers: (1) N-(3-aminopropyl)methacrylamide
hydrochloride (APMA), a monomer containing a primary amine which enables
the covalent conjugation of a suitable dye to the NPs, and (2) the
cross-linker monomer tetra ethylene glycol diacrylate (TTEGDA). The
synthesis and antibacterial properties were investigated. We hypothesize
that NPs bearing multiple surface BP units will demonstrate an antibacterial
activity.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of BP Compounds
The synthesis
of novel BP compounds N-Pht-Glu-BP, γ-Glu-BP,
and MA-Glu-BP is illustrated in Figure 2. The main challenge of the synthesis of the monomer
MA-Glu-BP was the substitution of the BP moiety only on one carboxylic
group of the glutamic acid. By synthesizing N-phthaloyl
glutamic anhydride, which converts glutamic acid to a cyclic anhydride,32 the activation of the carboxylic acid in the
γ position can be achieved while protecting the carboxylic acid
in the α position. The reaction of N-phthaloyl
glutamic anhydride with tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite produced the
intermediate N-Pht-Glu-BP,33 as initially intended. The removal of the N-phthalic
protecting group by acidic hydrolysis yielded γ-Glu-BP.34 The MA-Glu-BP monomer was then obtained by reacting
γ-Glu-BP with methacryloyl chloride under basic conditions.35,36

2.2 Synthesis of PolyMA-Glu-BP NPs
Cross-linked
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were synthesized by heterogeneous dispersion co-polymerization
of the novel BP monomer MA-Glu-BP with the monomer APMA (which contains
a primary amine for the covalent conjugation of a dye to the surface
of the NPs) and the cross-linker monomer TTEGDA (Figure 3A). The obtained spherical
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs have a dry diameter of 61.2 ± 6 nm, as measured
from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
(Figure 3B), and a
hydrodynamic diameter of 163.2 ± 7 nm (Figure 3C). The reason for the dry diameter of the
NPs being significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter is
probably because the hydrodynamic diameter takes into account the
solvent molecules adsorbed on the surface and within the NPs as well
as the Brownian motion.37

TEM image (B), and hydrodynamic size histogram
(C) of polyMA-Glu-BP NPs.

Information regarding the stability of the polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs was
obtained by zeta (ζ)-potential measurements. These measurements
were performed by gradually changing the pH from 2.5 to 10.9. Figure 4 exhibits the ζ-potential
curve of the dispersed polyMA-Glu-BP NPs (0.1 mg/mL) at different
pH values. At pH 2.5, the graph exhibits a low positive ζ-potential,
which may be explained by the presence of protonated amine groups
on the surface of the NPs. From pH 2.5 to 10.9, the curve shows a
significant decrease in the ζ-potential. This behavior is explained
by the deprotonation of the BP functional group as well as the deprotonation
of the carboxylic acid. The NPs are stable at around pH 7.4 (physiological
pH) and exhibit a ζ-potential of −24.3 ± 0.9 mV.
The isoelectric point calculated was 2.9.

polyMA-Glu-BP NPs at various pH values.

2.3 Kinetics of the Formation of the PolyMA-Glu-BP
NPs
Kinetics of the formation of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs was
measured by following the change in the hydrodynamic diameter and
yield of the formed NPs prepared according to the Experimental Section. Figure 5A demonstrates a marked decrease in the average diameter
of the NPs early on in the polymerization reaction. One minute after
initiation of the polymerization, the diameter measured was 557 ±
26 nm, decreasing to 371 ± 28 nm after 2 min and reaching 259
± 29 nm after 3 min. Then, the diameter of the particles continues
to reduce gradually as the reaction progresses, giving diameters of
253 ± 13, 236 ± 17, and 215 ± 19 nm after 5, 15, and
30 min of polymerization, respectively. The NP diameter stabilized
after 60 min of polymerization at 183 ± 8 nm. Following 120,
180, 240, 360, 480, 600, and 720 min, the particles present similar
diameters: 171 ± 10, 167 ± 6, 167 ± 5, 171 ± 8,
167 ± 7, 163 ± 8, and 160 ± 7 nm, respectively. The
NP diameter plateaus at an average of 166 ± 7 nm. This could
be explained by the rapid formation of a cross-linked polymer network,
which forms the initial particles. As the polymerization progresses,
the cross-linkage increases and the NPs become more compact and therefore
decrease in diameter.38−40

Figure 5 Kinetics of the formation of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs as
measured
by following the change in the hydrodynamic diameter (A) and yield
(B) of the formed NPs prepared according to the Experimental
Section.

To determine the optimal
reaction time for the polymerization of
the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs, the samples were purified, lyophilized, and
weighed. The yield at various time points was calculated (Figure 5B). It was noted
that the majority of the polymerization occurred during the initial
30 min (7.4 ± 3% after 5 min and 28.7 ± 2% after 30 min
of polymerization). The yield continued to increase gradually to 29.3
± 2% after 240 min and to 30 ± 1% after 480 min. A plateau
of 32 ± 2% was reached after 720 min of reaction.

2.4 Effect of the Polymerization Parameters on
the Size and Size Distribution of the Formed PolyMA-Glu-BP NPs
2.4.1 Effect of the Total Monomer Concentration
Figure 6 illustrates
the effect of the increase of the total monomer concentrations on
the hydrodynamic diameter and size destitution of the formed polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs. The monomers MA-Glu-BP, APMA, and TTEGDA were kept at a constant
ratio of 35, 10, and 55 wt %, respectively, but with different total
concentrations, while the other reaction conditions remain untouched.

Figure 6 Relationship
between the total monomer concentration and the diameter
size and size distribution of the formed particles.

It is evident, as shown in Figure 6, that as the total monomer concentration
is raised
from 1.5 to 5, 7.5, and 10%, there is a consistent increase in the
hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution of the formed polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs, 133 ± 10 to 242 ± 16, 438 ± 26, and 519 ±
38 nm, respectively. These findings can be attributed to the increasing
total amount of polymer formed in the reaction as well as the accelerating
polymerization rate. A higher concentration of monomers increases
the solubility of the oligomers formed, enabling the formation of
longer polymer chains prior to precipitation. In addition, the increase
in the concentration leads to agglomeration of the formed particles
and therefore an increase in the particle diameter. A similar behavior
on the effect of the total monomer concentration on the size and size
distribution of various NPs was already reported in the literature.41−43

2.4.2 Effect of the Cross-Linker Concentration
Figure 7 displays
the influence of increasing the cross-linker TTEGDA concentration
on the hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution of the particles
(while the weight ratio between MA-Glu-BP and APMA remained untouched).

Figure 7 Effect
of the weight % ratio [TTEGDA]/([MA-Glu-BP] + [APMA]) on
the diameter and size distribution of the formed polyMA-Glu-BP NPs.

Each sample had a combined monomer
concentration of 2.5% (w/v).
The ratio between the monomers is represented by the expression [TTEGDA]/([MA-Glu-BP]
+ [APMA]). Figure 7 demonstrates that when the ratio of [TTEGDA]/([MA-Glu-BP] + [APMA])
is raised from 1 to 1.2%, the diameter decreases from 197 ± 21
to 163 ± 11 nm, respectively. At 2.5%, there is a further decrease
in the diameter to 136 ± 12 nm. At 3.4 and 5%, similar diameters
were measured, which are 129 ± 7 and 130 ± 6 nm, respectively.
The decrease in the NP diameter and size distribution with increase
in the cross-linker concentration could be explained by the difficulties
in the growth of the highly cross-linked NPs relative to the less
cross-linked nuclei due to the monomer swelling. The swelling process
in water is generally more difficult with higher particle cross-linkage,
as already indicated in the literature.44−46

2.4.3 Effect of Mw and Concentration of
the Stabilizer Polyvinylpyrrolidone
Figure 8 illustrates
the effect of the molecular weight (40k and 360k g/mol) and concentration
of the stabilizer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) on the hydrodynamic diameter
and size distribution of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs. At a concentration
of 0.05%, the particle diameter obtained was 531 ± 43 nm for
PVP of 40k molecular weight and 350 ± 14 nm for PVP of 360k molecular
weight. At a concentration of 0.125%, both stabilizers decrease the
diameter of the particles to 473 ± 57 nm for 40k and 301 ±
10 nm for 360k. At 0.25%, both stabilizers continued to reduce the
diameter of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs, to a diameter of 462 ± 50
nm for 40k and 226 ± 7 nm for 360k. At 0.5%, the diameter further
declined to 431 ± 44 nm for 40k and 183 ± 11 nm for 360k.
A moderate decrease in the particle diameter was obtained for PVP
of 360k molecular weight; at 1 and 2% stabilizer concentration, the
diameters were 175 ± 9 and 160 ± 15 nm, respectively. However,
PVP of 40k molecular weight at 1% concentration exhibited a sharp
decrease in the particle diameter, resulting in a diameter of 278
± 47 nm, and reached a plateau at 2% concentration with a diameter
of 272 ± 48 nm. Both stabilizers demonstrate a similar trend
of inverse relationship between particle diameter and stabilizer concentration.
These results can be attributed to the adsorption of the stabilizer
on the surface of the particles, limiting the growth. PVP of 360k
molecular weight results in particles with a smaller diameter and
a smaller size distribution than 40k at similar concentrations. This
difference between both stabilizers could be explained by the greater
absorption of the stabilizer with a higher molecular weight on the
surface of the particles, therefore restricting the growth of the
particles.47−50 The same reason may also explain the significantly lower size distribution
of the NPs obtained with PVP of 360k molecular weight relative to
that obtained with PVP of 40k molecular weight, as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Effect of the molecular
weight (40k and 360k) and concentration
of the stabilizer PVP on the hydrodynamic size and size distribution
of the formed polyMA-Glu-BP NPs.

2.4.4 Effect of the Initiator Concentration
Figure 9 represents
the relationship between the initiator [potassium persulfate (PPS)]
concentration and the hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution
of the particles. By increasing the initiator concentration from 1
to 2%, the diameter of the particles is slightly reduced from 421
± 14 to 358 ± 11 nm, respectively. At 3%, there is a dramatic
decrease in the diameter to 187 ± 9 nm, followed by a mild decrease
at 4% to 160 ± 13 nm. At the following concentrations, the diameters
remain constant: 160 ± 6 nm for 8% and 163 ± 9 nm for 16%.
These results can be attributed to the fact that the higher the concentration
of initiator, the greater the number of polymerization sites; hence
more particles of smaller diameter are formed, as reported in the
literarure.44,48,51

Figure 9 Effect
of the concentration of PPS on the diameter of formed particles.

2.4.5 Effect
of Temperature
Figure 10 exhibits the effect
of the reaction temperature on the hydrodynamic diameter and size
distribution of the formed particles. The figure demonstrates that
by raising the temperature from 70 to 75 °C, the particle diameter
decreases from 192 ± 10 to 180 ± 10 nm, respectively. At
80 °C, the particle diameter further decreases to 160 ±
6 nm and remains similar at 85 °C (160 ± 11 nm). These findings
could be explained by the fact that the increase in temperature causes
an increase in the decomposition rate of the initiator PPS, which
leads to an increase in the number of polymerization sites created.
Consequently, more particles are formed but of smaller diameter.41

the formed
particles.

2.5 Calcium
Affinity Test Using Coral
Coral skeletons contain large amounts
of calcium carbonate (CaCO3),52,53 making their fragments a useful
tool for in vitro calcium affinity testing. Therefore, the adsorption
of the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent polyMA-Glu-BP NPs compared
with NIR fluorescent control NPs (containing methacryloylglutamine
monomer instead of the MA-Glu-BP monomer) toward coral was demonstrated
using a NIR fluorescence microscope (Figure 11). Corals treated with 0.5 mg/mL polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs (Figure 11F) exhibit
a prominent fluorescence compared to corals treated with 0.5 mg/mL
control NPs (Figure 11D), which do not exhibit any noticeable fluorescence. The fluorescence
intensities of the corals treated with polyMA-Glu-BP NPs and control
NPs were compared using ImageJ software. The results demonstrated
that the corals treated with polyMA-Glu-BP NPs exhibited an 11 times
greater fluorescence intensity than the control NPs.

Figure 11 Fluorescence microscopy
images: bright-field images of the corals
treated with water (A), 0.5 mg/mL NIR fluorescent control NPs (C),
and 0.5 mg/mL NIR fluorescent polyMA-Glu-BP NPs (E) and NIR images
of the corals treated with water (B), 0.5 mg/mL NIR fluorescent control
NPs (D), and 0.5 mg/mL NIR fluorescent polyMA-Glu-BP NPs (F).

In addition, the results of high-resolution
scanning electron microscopy
(HR-SEM) analysis of the corals treated with water, control NPs (0.5
mg/mL), and polyMA-Glu-BP NPs (0.5 mg/mL) are presented in Figure 12. There is a distinct
difference between the surfaces of the various treated corals. The
surface of the corals treated with water (Figure 12A) and control NPs (Figure 12B) appear similar and are composed of spikey
panels. In contrast, the corals treated with the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs
(Figure 12C) exhibit
a smooth surface, indicating that the surface of the coral is coated
by the NPs. These results can be attributed to the affinity of the
BP groups to the calcium ions in the coral in comparison to the control
NPs. These findings confirm that the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs have strong
affinity toward calcium in comparison to the control NPs.

control NPs (B), and 0.5 mg/mL polyMA-Glu-BP NP (C) aqueous dispersion,

2.6 Toxicity
of the PolyMA-Glu-BP NPs
Cytotoxicity and toxicity assays
[lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide
(XTT) tests] were performed on J774A1, hFOB 1.19, and RAW 264.7 human
cell lines. The results of LDH and XTT tests of all three types of
cells are summarized in Figure 13. The cells were treated for 48 and 72 h with a serial
diluted concentration of the polyMA-Glu-BP NP aqueous dispersion (1–1000
μg/mL). The LDH results obtained (Figure 13A) showed negligible cytotoxicity after
48 h of incubation for all three cell lines. Similar results were
demonstrated following 72 h of treatment with J774A1 and hFOB 1.19
cell lines; RAW 264.7 exhibited slight cytotoxicity (Figure 13B). The XTT results in Figure 13C,D for 48 and
72 h of treatment, respectively, exhibit that the viability of the
cells was unharmed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the NPs have
negligible toxicity under these conditions.

polyMA-Glu-BP NPs on J774A1, hFOB 1.19, and
RAW 264.7 cells: (A) LDH test after 48 h, (B) LDH test after 72 h,
(C) XTT test after 48 h, and (D) XTT test after 72 h.

2.7 Cellular Uptake of Cy7-polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs by
J774A1 Macrophages
To perform kinetic cellular uptake studies
of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs, the fluorescent dye cyanine7 (Cy7) was conjugated
to the free amine of the polyMA-Glu-BP NP surface (as described in
the Experimental Section). Kinetic cellar
uptake of the Cy7-polyMA-Glu-BP NPs (0.1 mg/mL) by J774A1 macrophage
cells was performed (Figure 14). The results summarized in Table 1 clearly demonstrate that the uptake of the
NPs by the J774A1 macrophage cells occurs in large quantity after
just 1 h of treatment, indicated by the Cy7 fluorescence (99.55 ±
0.07%). The fluorescence values remain similar for the following hours:
99.9 ± 0% after 5 h and 99.95 ± 0.07% after 24 h.

a Antibacterial activity of the polyMA-Glu-BP

The antibacterial activity
of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs was evaluated
as described in the Experimental Section,
by determining their minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) using Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two common bacterial pathogens representing Gram-negative bacteria,
and Listeria and Staphylococcus
aureus bacteria, which represent Gram-positive bacteria.
The bacteria were exposed to a serial diluted concentration of polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs in an aqueous dispersion, and the MBC was found to be 0.93 and
7.5 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively. The MBC for Listeria was found to be 1.87 mg/mL (Table 2). Notably, neither of the tested
concentrations demonstrated total kill of S. aureus. Nevertheless, at the range 7.5–0.23 mg/mL, there was a partial
killing with 7.5 mg/mL, leading to a reduction of 2.5 logs in the
viability of the bacteria.

3 Summary and Conclusions
In this work, the synthesis
of the vinylic monomer MA-Glu-BP and
the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs has been reported. To obtain an optimal particle,
the influence of the following parameters on the diameter of the polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs was studied: total monomer concentration, cross-linker concentration,
stabilizer Mw and concentration, initiator
concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time. The optimal
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs obtained have a dry diameter of 61.2 ± 6 nm
and a hydrodynamic diameter of 163.2 ± 7 nm.

The surface
BP functional groups have a high affinity to calcium
ions. This property was demonstrated by treating coral fragments with
polyMA-Glu-BP NPs and compared to those of double-distilled water
(DDW) and control NPs. The polyMA-Glu-BP NPs exhibited a high affinity
to the coral, which was 11 times greater than that of the control
NPs.

A cytotoxicity study of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs exhibited
no cytotoxic
effect under the experimental conditions on J774A1, hFOB 1.19, and
RAW 264.7 cells. On the other hand, the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs exhibited
toxicity toward the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa and the Gram-positive
bacteria Listeria. These findings may
suggest that the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs have a potential to be safely used
in humans against bacterial infections. This could be explained by
the fact that calcium is highly abundant in the bacterial cell wall
structure; therefore, chelating agents can easily disrupt the calcium
homeostasis of the bacteria. However, the mammalian cell membrane
contains much less calcium. Therefore, chelating agents cannot significantly
disrupt the calcium homeostasis of the mammalian cells.4,5 Therefore, further research is needed. In the future, additional
studies should be performed to understand the mechanism of toxicity
of these NPs toward different bacteria. Furthermore, because of the
presence of the surface amine, other antibacterial drugs can be conjugated
to the NPs in an attempt to increase the toxic effect toward bacteria.

4.2.3 Synthesis
and Characterization of N-Pht-Glu-BP
N-Phthaloyl glutamic
anhydride (8 g, 0.031 mol) was dissolved in 200 mL of dry THF under
a nitrogen atmosphere to give a clear off-white solution. Tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite
(20 g,0.07 mol) was then added to the solution and stirred overnight.
The obtained clear colorless solution was evaporated, resulting in
a clear pinkish oil, which was then dissolved in methanol (150 mL)
and stirred for 2 h to give a clear colorless solution. The methanol
solution was evaporated, and the resulting orange oil was washed with
diethyl ether (700 mL) and dried to yield the desired compound as
a white solid (10.8 g, 83.3% yield).33

Methacryloyl chloride (1 mL, 0.01 mol) was added
dropwise to a solution of γ-Glu-BP (2 g, 0.007 mol) and sodium
hydroxide (2 g, 0.05 mol) in DDW (20 mL) at 0 °C. The resulting
solution was stirred at 0 °C for 1.5 h and an additional 3.5
h at rt, and a clear colorless solution and white emulsions were obtained.
After removing the white emulsions, ethanol (250 mL) was added to
the clear solution, resulting in a white precipitant, which was collected
by Buchner filtration and washed with additional ethanol (850 mL),
yielding the desired product as a salt (2.5 g, 76.0% yield).35,36

4.3 Synthesis of the Cross-Linked PolyMA-Glu-BP
NPs
MA-Glu-BP (17.5 mg), 5 mg of APMA, and 27.5 mg of the
cross-linker monomer TTEGDA (a total monomer concentration of 2.5%
w/v) were added to a vial containing 4 mg of the initiator PPS (4
w/w %) and 20 mg of PVP of 360k molecular weight (1 w/v %) as a stabilizer
dissolved in 2 mL of 0.035 M HCl (aq). The vial containing the mixture
was purged with N2 to exclude air and then shaken at 80
°C overnight. The obtained polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were washed of excess
reagents by extensive dialysis cycles (cut-off of 1 000 000k)
with DDW, giving particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 163.2 ±
7 nm and a dry diameter of 61.2 ± 6 nm.

The NP formation
yield, 33.12%, was calculated by the following expression:  where Wparticles is the weight of the dried particles and Wtotal monomers is the initial weight of
the three polymerized
monomers.

The concentration of the BP groups of the particles,
as calculated
from the elemental analysis, was 0.2 mmol/g particles.

Elemental
analysis: C, 52.84% (calcd 50.32%); H, 7.02% (calcd 6.95%);
N, 1.31% (calcd 4.08%); P, 0.59% (calcd 4%).

4.4 Characterization
of the PolyMA-Glu-BP NPs
The dry diameter and size distribution
of the NPs were measured
with TEM. TEM images were obtained with an FEI Tecnai C2 BioTWIN electron
microscope with a 120 kV accelerating voltage. Samples for TEM were
prepared by placing a drop of diluted sample on a 400 mesh carbon-coated
copper grid previously exposed to plasma for 10 s. The average particle
diameter and size distribution were determined by the measurement
of the diameter of more than 200 particles. The hydrodynamic diameter
and size distribution of the particles dispersed in DDW were measured
at rt with a particle analyzer, model NANOPHOX (SympatecGmbH, Germany).

Electrokinetic properties (ζ-potential) of the formed particles
were measured using a titration method, from pH 2.5 to 10.9 with 0.1
M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH. The measurements were measured at a constant
ionic strength of 0.1 M. The ζ-potential of the formed particles
was measured by a ζ-potential analyzer model Zetasizer 3000
HSa (Malvern Instruments, UK).

Elemental analysis was performed
with a PerkinElmer 2400 series
II analyzer, by the analytical laboratories of the Hebrew University,
Jerusalem. Phosphorus content was determined using the oxygen flask
combustion method followed by ion chromatography analysis using a
Dionex IC system.

4.5 Synthesis of the Cy7-Conjugated
BP NPs
Cy7-conjugated polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were prepared by
the reaction of
the primary amino groups (belonging to the APMA monomeric units) on
the polyMA-Glu-BP NP surface with Cy7-NHS ester. Briefly, Cy7-NHS
ester (0.1 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO and added to 5 mL of
the polyMA-Glu-BP NP dispersion in 0.1 M BB (2 mg/mL), and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 1 h at rt. The residual amine groups were
then blocked by the addition of 5 mg of PEG-NHS (Mw 750) to the NIR fluorescent polyMA-Glu-BP NP aqueous
dispersion and stirred at rt for an additional 1 h. The obtained NIR
fluorescent conjugated polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were then washed of excess
reagents by extensive dialysis in DDW (a cutoff of 1 000 000k).
The excitation maxima of the dye shift from 746 to 768 nm because
of the conjugation to the NPs, and the emission maxima shift from
766 to 789 nm.

4.6 Synthesis and Characterization
of the Monomer
Methacryloylglutamine
Methacryloyl chloride (5.63 mL, 0.058
mol) was added dropwise to a solution of glutamine (2.1 g, 0.014 mol)
and sodium hydroxide (3.2 g, 0.08 mol) in DDW (40 mL) at 0 °C.
The resulting solution was stirred at 0 °C for 1.5 h and an additional
3.5 h at rt, giving a clear colorless solution and a white soft solid,
which were separated by filtration. The aqueous filtrate was acidified
to pH 1 with HCl 32% until a white precipitant appeared. The precipitant
was filtered off, and remaining aqueous solution was washed with EtOAc
(6 × 50 mL). The water was evaporated to give the desired product
(2.76 g, 92.9% yield).35,36

(s, H2N–CO–CH2–CH2−), 178.92 (s, CO2H).

4.7 Synthesis of the Control
NPs
Methacryloylglutamine
(70 mg), 20 mg of APMA, and 110 mg of the cross-linker monomer TTEGDA
(a total monomer concentration of 2.5 w/v %) were added to a vial
containing 16 mg of the initiator PPS (4 w/w %) and 80 mg of PVP of
360k molecular weight (1 w/v %) as a stabilizer dissolved in 8 mL
of 0.035 M HCl (aq). The vial containing the mixture was purged with
N2 to exclude air and then shaken at 80 °C overnight.
The obtained NPs were washed of excess reagents by extensive dialysis
cycles (a cutoff of 1 000 000k) with DDW, giving particles
with a hydrodynamic diameter of 149.1 ± 36 nm.

The NP formation
yield, 65.92%, was calculated by the following expression:  where Wparticles is the weight of the dried particles and Wtotal monomers is the initial weight of
the three polymerized
monomers.

4.8 Synthesis of the NIR Fluorescent Conjugated
Control NPs
Cy7-conjugated polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were prepared
by the reaction of the primary amino groups (belonging to the APMA
monomeric units) on the polyMA-Glu-BP NP surface with Cy7-NHS ester.
Briefly, Cy7-NHS ester (0.1 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous DMSO and
added to 5 mL of the control NP dispersion in 0.1 M BB (2 mg/mL),
and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at rt. The residual amine
groups were then blocked by the addition of 5 mg of PEG-NHS (Mw 750) to the NIR fluorescent control NP aqueous
dispersion and stirred at rt for an additional 1 h. The obtained NIR
fluorescent conjugated control NPs were then washed of excess reagents
by extensive dialysis in DDW (a cutoff of 1 000 000k).

4.9 Calcium Affinity Test of the PolyMA-Glu-BP
NPs
The affinity of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs to calcium ions
was evaluated by incubating coral fragments (5.55 mg) with NIR fluorescent
polyMA-Glu-BP NP dispersion (200 μL, 0.5 mg/mL) for 2 h. The
solution was removed, and the coral was washed three times with 1
mL of DDW. As a reference, coral fragments were treated similarly
with the NIR fluorescent control NP dispersion (200 μL, 0.5
mg/mL) and DDW. The coral fragments were evaluated by a fluorescent
microscope Olympus BX 60 Qimaging EXi Blue QCcapture X-64. In addition,
the coral fragments were then attached to a stab with carbon glue
tape, coated with carbon in vacuum, and analyzed with a high-resolution
scanning electron microscope (FEI, Magellan 400L).

4.10 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of the PolyMA-Glu-BP
NPs
In vitro cytotoxicity of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs was tested
by using RAW 264.7 (mice macrophages; Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed),
J774A.1 (mice macrophages; reticulum cell sarcoma), and hFOB 1.19
(human osteoblast; SV40 large T antigen-transfected) cell lines. The
cells are adherent to the culture dishes. RAW 264.7 and J774A.1 cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with heat-inactivated FBS (10%), penicillin (100 IU/mL),
streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and l-glutamine (2 mM). hFOB
1.19 cells were maintained in 1:1 mixture of Ham’s F12 medium
and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (without phenol
red), with heat-inactivated FBS (10%), penicillin (100 IU/mL), streptomycin
(100 μg/mL), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 0.3 mg/mL G418.
Cells were screened to ensure that they remained mycoplasma-free using
a mycoplasma detection kit.54

Cell
cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring the release of cytoplasmic
LDH into cell culture supernatants. LDH activity was assayed using
the cytotoxicity detection kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.55 Briefly, cells (5 ×
103 cells per well) were seeded and grown for 48 h in 96-well
plates before treatment with the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs. Cell cultures
that were not exposed to the NPs were included in all assays as negative
controls. Cell cultures that were treated with cell lysis solution
were used as positive controls.

The polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were freshly
dispersed in PBS (1.25 and 2.5
mg/mL) and then added to the 95% confluent cell culture in culture
medium. The cell cultures were further incubated at 37 °C in
a humidified 5% CO2 incubator and then checked for cellular
cytotoxicity after 48 h of incubation. The percentage of cell cytotoxicity
was calculated using the formula shown in the manufacturer’s
protocol.55 All samples were tested in
tetraplicates.

4.11 Cell Proliferation Analysis
XTT
analysis56 was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Biological Industries). In brief,
RAW 264.7 (mice macrophages; Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed),
J774A.1 (mice macrophages; reticulum cell sarcoma), and hFOB 1.19
(human osteoblast; SV40 large T antigen-transfected) cells were seeded
onto 96-well plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The polyMA-Glu-BP NPs were freshly dispersed in PBS (1.25
and 2.5 mg/mL) and then added to the 95% confluent cell culture in
culture medium. The cell cultures were further incubated at 37 °C
in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator and then checked for cellular
viability after 48 h of incubation. The percentage of cell viability
was calculated using the formula shown in the manufacturer’s
protocol.56 All samples were tested in
tetraplicates.

4.12 Flow Cytometry Analyses
of NP Uptake
To study the effect of the incubation time on
the uptake of polyMA-Glu-BP
NPs, J774A.1 cells were incubated with Cy7-conjugated BP NPs (at 0.3
mg/mL) for 1, 5, and 24 h. Cells were then washed twice with fresh
medium and collected in the dark. The uptake of the Cy7-conjugated
NPs within cells was evaluated by FACSAria III (BD) cell sorting.
To maximize the cell viability and minimize the mechanical perturbations,
the flow rate was set to 1.1 (minimum). A minimum of 10 000
cells were analyzed for each histogram generated. Gate SSC/FSC was
used to exclude fragments and aggregates from the cell count. For
Cy7 analysis, a 633 nm excitation laser was used with a filter. Data
were processed by FlowJo v7.6.4.57

4.13 Bacterial Cultures and Growth Conditions
Bacterial
cultures and growth conditions were similar to those
reported in the literature.25,29E. coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 29213,
and P. aeruginosa PAO1 were grown overnight
at 37 °C under agitation (250 rpm) in Mueller Hinton (MH, Difco),
and Listeria innocua ATCC 33090 was
grown in Brain Heart (BH, Difco) growth media.

4.14 Antibacterial Activity Assay of the PolyMA-Glu-BP
NPs
The antibacterial activity of the polyMA-Glu-BP NPs was
evaluated by determining the MBC values for all bacterial strains
tested. The stock dispersion of the NPs was diluted in two-fold serial
dilutions ranging from a concentration of 7.5 to 0.058 mg/mL in saline
solution in a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One). Each well contained
105 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL of each bacterial strain.
Bacteria treated with DDW served as a negative control. The following
day, 10-fold serial dilutions were carried out and the bacterial cells
were plated on LB agar plates, followed by their incubation at 37
°C for 20 h. Cell growth was monitored and determined by viable
cell count and expressed as CFUs. All experiments were conducted in
duplicates at least three independent times.
