In
our previous study, we developed an array of unique porous structures
(an array of barnacle-like porous structures) to apply to biosensing
chips. The porous structure was formed by an internal swelling phenomenon
of a polystyrene colloidal particle monolayer, which was surrounded
by a poly(vinyl alcohol) layer, for the duration of the monolayer’s
immersion in a toluene bath. Barnacle-like porous structures were
formed when polystyrene particles that had rapidly swelled broke the
outer layer around the top of the particles. However, after the surface
was coated with a thin Ag layer, the porous structure showed a relatively
broad extinction spectrum that was undesirable for sensing chips based
on both surface plasmon extinction and grating coupling. In this paper,
we propose an approach to obtain relatively sharp extinction spectra
based on the decimation of the spatial frequencies of the porous structures.
This study also investigates formation properties in more detail to
control the structural features of the resultant porous structures.
A relatively sharp peak in the extinction spectrum was ultimately
obtained.

Introduction
Nowadays, polymer materials
are widely used in industrial production
because their plasticity makes them easy to manufacture. This merit
can be utilized in the development of nano- and microstructures in
research fields related to sensing devices, microfluidic devices,
etc.1−5 Because fabrication processes must be developed to realize the functionalities
of these devices, various techniques have been proposed to achieve
this aim. These strategies can be broadly classified into two opposing
categories.2,6 The first comprises top-down approaches
that are based on targeted functions originating from relatively established
processing, while the other encompasses bottom-up approaches that
are initiated by unique processing. In the latter, the functionality
is designed to enable production associated with unique processing.
Both approaches have been successfully addressed and are extremely
important to the progress of the related technologies. As a result,
many types of available processes and the resultant functional structures
using various polymer materials were reported, as described below.

Various lithographical techniques have been employed for the patterning
of functional structures, which aim to advance electronic devices,
biosensing chips, and microfluidic chips.3,4,7 For example, colloidal lithography is a
unique process that uses polymer colloidal particles. Colloidal particle
monolayers are typically used as the template in this lithographic
process and can be combined with various elements such as capillary
forces, chemical reactions, etchings, surface and/or interface interactions,
external fields, and physicochemical phenomena.8,9 As
a result, various unique structures can be applied to hydrophobic
surfaces, bioapplication of a cell culture, sensing chips, electronic
devices, etc. Imprint- or molding-based techniques can also be used
for the development of polymeric functional structures.10,11 The resultant products have homogeneous structures all over the
surfaces, based on the accuracy of prepared molds. Direct laser writing
is another specific process that forms artificial structures on polymer
surfaces.12 Accurate structuring can be
achieved through the optimization of polymer materials, irradiation
energy, scanning speed, and step width. The use of laser treatment
to induce periodic surface structures is also an effective technique
that forms fine ripple structures on polymer surfaces.13−15 Rippled polymer films are adequate for several applications such
as cell culture substrates and surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensors.

As mentioned above, advances in the structuring technology of polymer
materials mirror the development of novel and high-performance devices.
However, the development of puckered or pinched porous structures
such as barnacles or volcanoes has not considerably progressed. In
nature, various pinched porous structures can be found such as shells
of barnacles, volcanoes, nests of woodpeckers or potter wasps, and
nasal cavities of humans. As humans, we also use many similar structures
such as bottles, flasks, socks, and balloons. Each porous structure
is associated with its functionality to realize its specific objective.
Specifically, these pinched porous structures are used to sustain
the objects housed inside them apart from the outside of pores. In
this way, they are different from the functionality of waistless hole
structures. This is highlighted by the difference between a beaker
and a flask. Objects can be introduced into the inside of the beaker,
and objects can be removed from the inside. Conversely, accessibility
to objects inside a flask is significantly reduced, while preservability
is increased. This advantage can be similarly utilized in the development
of polymeric functional structures, which has led to some effective
structures being reported. Lee et al., for instance, have fabricated
a pinched structure that can protect the inside from shearing forces,
which allows the structure to be used as a container to stably dock
cells.16 Yue et al., meanwhile, presented
a flask-like porous structure that is deep-set in a silicone rubber
substrate for use in cell culture.17 Zhang
et al. outlined an approach to form a volcano-like structure in nanoscale.18 In their study, a photoresist layer was irradiated
by UV light that was scattered by silica beads with a diameter of
50 nm. This resulted in the formation of highly structured and volcano-like
structures in nanoscale. The puckered structure cannot be formed using
typical photolithographic approaches that are based on proximity irradiation
with photomasks. Akerboom et al. have achieved overhang structures
in submicrometer scale.19 The void that
is surrounded by an overhanging wall was fabricated using interfacial
polymerization of polypyrrole at the surface of the colloidal particle
monolayer. The surface of the resultant structure generated a hydrophobic
effect despite the fact that it was made from a hydrophilic material.

In our previous study, we outlined a unique approach to forming
barnacle-like porous structures that focused on a target-collective
sensing chip.20,21 The porous structure formation
is illustrated in Figure S1. This approach
uses a polystyrene colloidal particle monolayer as a template, and
the monolayer is then coated with a thin poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)
layer. When the monolayer is immersed in a toluene bath, the toluene
penetrates the polystyrene (PS) part, through the outer PVA layer,
which causes the PS to rapidly swell. As a result, this “internal
swelling effect” creates internal pressure toward the outside,
which breaks the outer PVA layer and creates barnacle-like porous
structures. The shell structure of the barnacle is thus formed by
a thin and puckered PVA layer, as shown in Figure S2. When the surface of the porous structure array was coated
with a thin Au layer (∼100 nm), the array exhibited a relatively
broad extinction spectrum, and its characteristics are not suitable
for optical sensing chips that detect chemical or biological targets.
This is despite a relatively large extinction peak shift dependent
on the ambient refractive index (∼480 nm/RIU), as shown in Figure S2. The broad extinction spectrum is attributable
to the shape of the barnacle-like structure, which is a hemispherical
envelope, and is also based on the initial template of the colloidal
particle monolayer.

The present study proposes an approach to
modify the spatial frequencies
of the resultant fine porous structures for use as sensing chips.
This requires an improved fabrication process and a detailed investigation
into formation characteristics to control the structural features
of the pores. The relationship between the structural features and
the exhibited extinction spectra will then be discussed to identify
the specific extinction spectra that result in highly sensitive sensing
chips for the detection of ambient refractive index changes.

Results
and Discussion
The improved fabrication process presented
in this study was developed
based on the sequential process described in the Experimental Section. The first consideration was how to transfer
the PS pillars onto a substrate. The PS pillars should be transferred
to a substrate without the remaining layer, as this induces the formation
of a porous structure that is based on the internal swelling effect,
after the PVA coating. (The remaining layer in the fields of imprint
processes is illustrated in Figure S3.)
If the PS template has a remaining layer the outer PVA layer will
not be anchored to the bottom substrate at any point and will be removed
in the toluene bath when the internal swelling of the PS pillars occurs.
A hemispherical poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold was prepared to
optimize the transfer process of the PS template, as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1b–e presents the transferred
PS hemispheres with Mws of 3250, 9550,
18 000, and 48 000, respectively. The conditions involving
400 rpm for 2 s and 4000 rpm for 50 s were applied to the spin-coating
as the first slow spreading and second quick coating, respectively.
The heights and diameters of the PS hemispheres, as functions of the
temperature of the bottom substrate, were measured and are plotted
in Figure 1f,g. The
dashed lines plotted in both figures indicate the identical height
and diameter of PS hemispheres, based on the structural specifications
of the mold, as illustrated in Figure 1a. The larger Mw of PS
and the lower temperature of heating both were found to more successfully
transfer the PS structures without the remaining layers. This is considered
a reasonable result, since the Tg of PS
was directly related to the Mw. (Their
ideal relationship is illustrated in Figure S4.) When the heating temperature was relatively low, most of the PS
that infilled the mold could be transferred without evaporating. In
addition, the viscosity of the melted PS with the higher Mw simultaneously increases. A large portion of the PS
could be transferred from the mold to the substrate without breaking
the infilled PS. Moreover, a significant decrease of the Tg of the polymer surface is reported by many researchers.22−24 It is considered that the decrease affects the melting and evaporation
of PS under substrate heating. (Simultaneously, there are possibilities
of shrinking and remaining of PS portions in the PDMS mold.) As a
result, a Mw of 48 000 and a heating
temperature of 50 °C were selected as the optimal conditions
for this study.

and 48 000, respectively. (f) Height and (g) diameters of hemispheres

To fabricate puckered or pinched porous structures, a pillar array
mold with the same height and diameter of 1 μm was also prepared.
Then, the PS pillars were transferred, coated with PVA, and immersed
in toluene according to the process illustrated in the Experimental Section. The resultant structures were observed
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 2a–c. PS pillars without the remaining layers
and PVA-coated pillars with a PVA layer attached to the bottom substrate
were both obtained, as indicated by the red and blue arrows. Puckered
porous structures subsequently opened, which resembled volcanoes or
hollow stumps, as a result of the internal swelling effect. Thus,
the toluene infiltrated the outer thin PVA layer, as expected. Openings
in the upper side of the pillars would not have been obtained if there
was insufficient anchoring of the PVA layer attached to the substrate.
(The anchored skirts are indicated by the yellow arrow.) To understand
this formation in more detail, the fabrication process was performed
under various conditions in terms of both the PVA concentration of
the aqueous solution and the plasma treatment time before immersion
in toluene. These results are summarized as a phase diagram in Figure 3. Use of PVA solutions
with relatively low concentrations (<∼2 wt %) to coat the
PS pillars results in porous structures with low profiles, which is
an unfavorable formation. Conversely, properly adjusted PVA solution
concentrations (∼3 wt %) obtained more favorable and expected
porous structures. The opening could not be generated when excessive
PVA concentrations (>∼4 wt %) were applied, which resulted
in another unfavorable formation. Thus, favorable and unfavorable
formations are closely associated with the thickness of the PVA layer
that surrounds the PS pillars, meaning that the PVA must be of a concentration
that can be broken by the internal swelling effect. Simultaneously,
it must also be of a concentration that can be sustained as a self-standing
structure. Plasma treatment time is another controlling factor that
affects the thickness of the PVA layer, since, even in situations
where the PVA concentration was exceeded, a favorable formation can
be obtained through a relatively long plasma treatment. This outcome
is attributable to plasma treatment’s etching effect on the
outer PVA layer.21,25 Therefore, the formation can
be controlled by both conditions. The phase diagram indicates the
other point with respect to the internal swelling effect. The border
between phases (B) and (C) can be defined approximately and, therefore,
suggests that there is a threshold value of internal force in terms
of what is needed to break the PVA layer, especially around the top
of the structure. This force corresponds to the pressure exhibited
by the PS when it swells effectively. If the PVA layer is excessively
thick, the internal outward force expands in all directions within
the PVA layer. This results in overly expanded structures that lack
an opening, as depicted in the upper SEM image of phase (C) in Figure 3. (Besides, the deformation
indicates that toluene can penetrate through the relatively thicker
PVA layers.) Consequently, this experiment clearly revealed the relationship
between the thickness of the surrounding PVA layer and the resultant
structures. In addition, the formation of the porous structure can
be explained by a mechanical action resulting from the PS swelling,
which puts pressure on the outer thin PVA layer. Our next step was
to focus on structural variations that influence a favorable formation
in the region of phase (B).

swelling effect. (A), (B), and (C) correspond to the structural phases
of an unfavorable formation with low profiles, favorable formation,
and unfavorable formation without opening, respectively. Each SEM
image was captured with the same magnification and black scale bar.

The heights of the porous structure (H) and its
thin wall (or shell) structure (ΔH) were measured
using SEM observations for all of the porous structures that had been
fabricated under various conditions within the region of phase (B),
as shown in Figure 4a,b. H increased as the PVA concentration increased
similarly under each condition with different plasma treatment times.
This trend is explained by the relationship between the thickness
of the PVA layer and the PVA concentration, as previously discussed.
Both the thickness of the layer in the flat part and the height of
the wall increase when the concentration (or viscosity) of the PVA
solution is increased. Figure 4c–e illustrates typical examples of H variations of 240, 390, and 560 nm. (ΔH was
also varied as 180, 230, and 160 nm in Figure 4c–e, respectively.) ΔH increased when there were relatively low concentrations,
but it then decreased when there were relatively high concentrations.
The reason for the initial increase is similar to the explanation
for H. However, the mechanism for the decrease at
relatively high concentrations is unclear even taking into account
the differences in the plasma treatment time. (If ΔH was saturated to the increasing of PVA concentration,
the ΔH would be limited at a certain height,
based on the mechanical properties of PVA.) Possibly, the increase
of H has affected the decrease of ΔH. When H is relatively low, the anchoring
force of the substrate works on the upper PVA layer. Conversely, when H is relatively high, the effect of the anchoring force
decreases rapidly. As a result, ΔH decreases
when the PVA concentration increases. These results suggest that the
structural features (H and ΔH) can be controlled by both PVA concentration and plasma treatment
time.

Figure 4 (a) and (b) show the heights of the porous structure (H) and the thin wall structure (ΔH), respectively.
(c), (d), and (e) show typical examples of a porous structure with H of 240, 390, and 560 nm, respectively.

This experiment revealed the formation mechanism of a unique
porous
structure and the factors that control its structural features, as
the previous discussion emphasizes. To achieve the initial objective
of attaining highly sensitive sensing chips with sharp extinction
peaks, we investigated the optical characteristics of sensing chips
that are based on this porous structure. The diameter of the initial
PS pillar array was modified to 500 nm to obtain the extinction peak
in a visible region.

Five samples of the porous structure, with
different structural
features, were prepared. Their properties are summarized in Table 1 and depicted as a
phase diagram in Figure S5, which is similar
to that in Figure 3. The influence of the modified diameter is evident in the shift
of phase (B) toward a region of a lower PVA concentration. The SEM
images and extinction spectra of these samples are presented in Figure 5. Each sample was
coated with thin Ag layers, with an approximate thickness of 80 nm,
and the extinction spectra were measured using an optical setup, which
is illustrated in the Experimental Section. Each extinction spectrum in Figure 5 has a different shape, depending on their structural
features. Differences are particularly evident in the two distinct
peaks (the first and second peaks) at around 460 and 550 nm. The extinction
ratios for these two peaks (ratios of the extinction values of the
second peak to the first peak) were calculated to characterize these
differences. These were then plotted as functions of H and ΔH in Figure 6a,b, respectively. These characteristics
indicate a wealth of important information in terms of designing sensing
chips based on the detection of spectral peak shifts. First, either
peak can be enhanced by selectively adjusting H,
as shown in Figure 6a. In addition, the equivalent extinction of both peaks can also
be realized using a sample with a relatively high H, of around 500 nm. Moreover, the second peak can be enhanced by
controlling ΔH, which results in a relatively
sharp single peak, as shown in Figure 6b. (This design guideline for the second peak enhancement
is applicable only in the region of phase B in Figure S5.) Thus, adjustment of H and ΔH provides numerous possibilities for designing in terms
of both functionality and sensitivity. As expected, this could result
in improved sensing chips with respect to the sharpness of the extinction
peak. To understand these optical characteristics, we evaluated the
extinction spectra taking the structural features of fine surfaces
into account. In Figure 7a, the extinction spectrum of sample C is replotted and the extinction
spectrum of the PVA-coated pillars before the immersion in toluene
is plotted simultaneously. The profile of the PVA-coated pillars is
relatively close to a sinusoidal shape, compared to the original pillars,
as shown in the inset SEM images in Figure 7. Both the spectra were synthesized directly,
and the resultant spectrum is plotted in Figure 7b to compare with the extinction spectrum
of Ag-coated original pillars. Both the spectra are noticeably similar.
This compositional analysis led to an interesting conclusion, namely,
that a sharp extinction spectrum can be obtained by removing the sinusoidal
component that corresponds to the fundamental spatial frequency of
the periodic structure of the original pillar structures. This exactly
matches the formation of the porous structure through the proposed
process, which uses the internal swelling effect. As a result of this
effective decimation of spatial frequencies, the sharpness of the
extinction peak can be substantially improved, compared with that
of our previous sensing chips, which are illustrated in Figure S2. This approach is supported by a theoretical
treatment of surface plasmon resonance in periodic metallic structures.26−29 When an optical wave is incident to such a periodic metallic substance,
the wavenumber vector of the coupled wave is described as ki sin θ + mK, where ki and θ are the wavenumber
vector and the incident angle of the incident wave, respectively,
and mK corresponds to the mth-order spatial frequency of the periodic structure. A surface plasmon
wave with a wavenumber vector kSP is then
elicited from the incident optical wave in the metallic portion. When
both wavenumbers are consistent with each other, as represented by 1  strong surface plasmon resonance is generated.
In eq 1, the ±mth order of the coupled waves is defined practically. The
resonance can be observed experimentally, as sharp extinction spectra
at specific wavelengths, when the incident optical wave has a continuous
spectrum. Strong and sharp extinction spectra are observable when
the shape of the metallic structure is properly designed, which include
certain spatial frequencies with the fewest possible m numbers. This effect could be utilized to improve sensing chips
that are based on the proposed fabrication process.

An effective approach, based
on removing fundamental spatial frequencies,
has been employed in some cases that have yielded significant benefits.
A well-known example is stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy.30 Traditional fluorescent microscopy with a high
resolution uses a highly focused excitation beam to obtain a smaller
emission spot, resulting in high-resolution fluorescent imaging. However,
the reduction of the focused beam diameter is limited by the diffraction
barrier. This issue has been addressed using doughnut-like STED beams
that deplete the peripheral fluorescent emission. The skirts of the
gradually distributed optical intensity of the STED spot effectively
generate a narrow remaining emission spot. This approach can also
be used in photopatterning to realize fine structuring.31−33 Therefore, hollow distributions of structure or energy could significantly
benefit many research fields.

The sensing ability for detecting
refractive index changes was
evaluated from several samples. Figure 8a depicts the peak shift of the extinction spectra
of sample E, which exhibits similar extinctions in its first and second
peaks. According to changes in the ambient refractive index, the peaks
shifted toward longer-wavelength regions. Their shifts can be characterized
as linear functions of the ambient refractive index, as shown in Figure S6a. This means that the porous structures,
with a ΔH of 150 nm, enable two-channel sensing.
A functional sensing chip with high reliability is thus proposed,
which uses either of the peaks as the subchannel for a parity check,
to inhibit operational error. Figure 8b depicts the peak shift of the extinction spectra
of sample D, which exhibits the enhanced second peak and suppressed
first peak. Here, the peaks similarly shifted toward longer-wavelength
regions, depending on the ambient refractive index changes. Their
shifts were also characterized as linear functions, as shown in Figure S6b. The sensing ability of sample D was
evaluated using proportional constants in the linear fittings of the
peak shift characteristics, including that of the other samples that
are listed in Table 1. The results are plotted in Figure 8c as a function of ΔH. The spectral
peak shift has a unit of nm/RIU (i.e., wavelength shift per unit refractive
index), which corresponds to the sensing ability that was used as
a figure of merit for the optical sensing chips. Sensitivity increased
as ΔH increased. Second peaks yielded relatively
large peak shifts, and the value exceeded that of our previous sensing
chip, depicted in Figure S2. Since ΔH can be controlled by the PVA concentration, even within
a relatively narrow range, the resultant sensitivity can be determined
by the conditions of the fabrication process. The sensitivity of sample
D, which had a relatively high ΔH of 220 nm,
exhibited a higher sensing ability of around 530 nm/RIU, as well as
an enhanced second extinction peak, which is shown in Figures 5 and 8b.

Figure 8 (a) and (b) show extinction spectra depending on ambient refractive
index changes for samples E and D, respectively. (c) Peak shifts of
the first and second peaks as functions of ΔH.

It can thus be concluded that
the structural features of the porous
structure are closely related to the characteristics of both the shapes
and peak shifts of its extinction spectra. Structural features (H and ΔH) were also determined by
both PVA concentration and plasma treatment time. Therefore, the realization
of usable sensing chips requires effective strategic processes that
engage with a range of factors. In addition, it may be necessary to
include both top-down and bottom-up approaches in the practical development
stage. Simultaneously, some interesting phenomena can be identified
from a material science perspective. For example, in terms of the
physical property of the pore lips, the thin PVA layer that forms
the lips was elongated and fractured under the internal swelling effect
of PS pillars, resulting in the volcano-like shape being stably sustained.
Although Figure 2c
illustrates that the wall thickness is less than 100 nm, the lips
actually resemble a beaker that has been melted down during the manufacturing
process. Therefore, the macromolecular property of the PVA may differ
significantly among the lips, walls, and flat sections on a substrate.34 The deposition of Ag atoms during sputtering
would subsequently also be affected by these differences.35,36 In addition, the internal swelling effect is itself an attractive
phenomenon. In the present study, this was utilized to produce a porous
structure using an internal physical action, namely, the pressure
of the PS swelling toward the outside of the PVA layer. When the internal
pressure exceeds the net external force of the toluene fluidic pressure
and the reaction force of the PVA layer, the PVA layer fractures and
the opening begins to form. This outcome could be employed to perform
a quantitative analysis of the internal pressure of polymer materials
through swelling using conditions on the border between phases (B)
and (C), which are illustrated in Figure 3. These advanced conclusions will be useful
in further investigations into both unique and functional structures
composed of polymer materials.

Conclusions
This study evaluated
a strategy for attaining highly sensitive
sensing chips for the detection of ambient refractive index changes.
This approach focuses on the structural features of the unique porous
structure that can be obtained using an improved fabrication process
that utilizes an internal swelling effect. This strategy yielded highly
sensitive sensing chips that are suitable for detecting targeted substances,
materials, and biomolecules. In addition, this study identified many
benefits with respect to the formation mechanism of the porous structure,
the factors controlling the structural features, the relationships
between structural features and extinction spectra, and design factors
that influence highly sensitive and/or functional sensing abilities.
These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
However, the metallic layer may contain another element that relates
to plasmonic excitation, which holds the possibility of further improving
the sensing ability. Future developments should subsequently focus
on the complete strategy and include numerical electromagnetic analysis
to realize the practical usability of sensing chips.

Experimental
Section
Materials
To improve the porous structure fabrication
process, which is based on the internal swelling effect, PS pillar
templates were prepared. Various PSs with different molecular weights
(Mw) of 3250, 9550, 18 000, and
48 000 (Sigma-Aldrich Co. CLL.) were tested for the fabrication
of PS pillar arrays because the proposed approach includes a thermal
treatment for transferring PS pillars from molds to substrates. Poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS, SIM-360, Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.) was used for the fabrication
of the molds of a pillar array. Soft imprint that uses PDMS molds
was preformed to transfer PS structures without the remaining films.
A modified PVA with silanol moieties in the side chains (R2105, Kuraray
Co.) was used to coat the PS templates, and the degrees of polymerization
and hydrolysis were 500 and 97.0–99.0, respectively. The chemical
structure is shown in Figure 9a. This PVA is suitable for puckered or pinched porous structures,
as the thin outer shell of the pores can be sustained by the inter-
and intramolecular cross-linking of silanol moieties.21 In addition, this PVA is durable in terms of swelling,37 which is also preferable for a fabrication process
that involves an internal swelling effect.

Methods
The fabrication process
is schematically illustrated
in Figure 9b. First,
a PDMS mold was prepared, with an array pattern of pillars. The pillar
mold was filled with PS by means of the spin-coating method, which
used a toluene solution of PS with a concentration of 3 wt %. The
infilled PS was transferred onto a glass substrate without the remaining
layer. This transfer process focused on optimizing the conditions
of PS molecular weight and the temperature of the substrate, as well
as the pressure applied to the PDMS mold. In this study, a pressure
of 5 N/cm2 was applied, based on a preliminary investigation.
Plasma treatment was performed using a plasma cleaner (YHS-R, SAKIGAKE
Semiconductor Co.) to obtain the proper wettability of PS and the
bottom substrate. The duration was determined as 30 s from a preliminary
investigation. Then, the PS pillars on the substrate were coated with
PVA by means of the spin-coating method, which uses various aqueous
solutions of PVA with different concentrations. The concentration
of the solution is directly associated with the thickness of the wall
(or the shell) in the resultant pores. The PVA-coated PS pillars on
the substrate were dried in a vacuum oven and then plasma-treated
again.21 Finally, the substrate was immersed
in a toluene bath. During the immersion process, the internal PS pillars
became swollen because the toluene infiltrated the outer PVA layer.
Puckered or pinched porous structures were formed as a result.

The formed porous structures were revealed using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JSM-5910LV, JEOL). Their surfaces were coated with
thin Ag layers, with an approximate thickness of 80 nm, to evaluate
the sensing ability. Extinction spectra were measured using an optical
microscope system, with both a digital camera and a spectrometer,
as shown in Figure 9c. The reflected light from the Ag surface was adjusted to an almost
normal reflection arrangement using an object lens with a relatively
low NA of 1.3.38 To measure sensitivity
in terms of ambient refractive index changes, a spectral measurement
was performed on porous structures that were surrounded by different
media (air, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and decane) with refractive
indexes of 1.000, 1.363, 1.375, and 1.411, respectively.
