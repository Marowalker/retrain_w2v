Fibrous
nanomaterials have been widely employed toward the improvement
of photovoltaic devices. Their light-trapping capabilities, owing
to their unique structure, provide a direct pathway for carrier transport.
This paper reports the improvement of perovskite solar cell (PSC)
performance by a well-dispersed TiO2-coated gold nanowire
(GNW) in a TiO2 cell layer. We used an artificially designed
cage-shaped protein to synthesize a TiO2-coated GNW in
aqueous solution under atmospheric pressure. The artificially cage-shaped
protein with gold-binding peptides and titanium-compound-biomineralizing
peptides can bind GNWs and selectively deposit a thin TiO2 layer on the gold surface. The TiO2-coated GNW incorporated
in the photoelectrodes of PSCs increased the external quantum efficiency
within the range of 350–750 nm and decreased the internal resistance
by 12%. The efficient collection of photogenerated electrons by the
nanowires boosted the power conversion efficiency by 33% compared
to a typical mesoporous-TiO2-nanoparticle-only electrode.

Introduction
Perovskite solar cells
(PSCs) with a perovskite-structured compound
(CH3NH3PbX3, X = I, Br, and Cl) as
the light-harvesting active layer have attracted attention because
of their extremely low fabrication cost and high power conversion
efficiency (PCE).1 Miyasaka et al. first
reported an organic–inorganic halide perovskite material (CH3NH3PbI3) as a light absorber of a conventional
liquid electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), yielding
a PCE of 3.8%.2 In 2012, Miyasaka and Snaith
et al. demonstrated solid-state PSCs utilizing an organic solid-state
hole-transporting layer (HTL) and reported a high PCE of 10.9%.3 After that, the PCE of the PSCs achieved over
20% in a very short time.4 One typical
PSC device is based on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact-TiO2 (CL-TiO2)/mesoporous-TiO2 (mp-TiO2)/halide perovskite material/HTL/Au electrode. The mp-TiO2 has a high surface area for supporting the perovskite material
and offers sufficient interfacial contact for robust electron extraction
and transport to an FTO layer.1,3 Nanomaterials have been
employed as an electrical nanofiller for the improved performances
of mp-TiO2/halide perovskite material layers. The ideal
characteristics for the electrical nanofillers in PSC photoelectrodes
are to trap solar light efficiently and transfer photogenerated electron
carriers quickly from TiO2-composed PSC photoelectrodes
to FTO electrodes, thus increasing the electron carrier generation
and the suppression of carrier–hole recombination and trapping
at grain boundaries in the mp-TiO2 matrix.3,5,6 Mali et al. deposited an atomic
layer deposition-passivated ultrathin TiO2 layer on the
hydrothermally grown TiO2 nanorod array and achieved a
significantly enhanced PCE of 13.45%.7 Rong
et al. reported that the high reactivity of (001) facets in TiO2 nanosheets improved the interfacial properties between the
perovskite and the TiO2 matrix. The highest PCE measured
from such a HTL-free device was 10.64%.8 Yu et al. constructed a three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 nanowire.
A PSC with 3D TiO2 nanowire achieved a high PCE of 9.0%.9 Although mixing nanomaterials in the TiO2 paste is suitable for printing processes, the nanomaterials
aggregate easily, deteriorating the performance. To make the nanomaterials
function effectively, it is necessary to disperse the nanomaterials
well with titanium oxide paste. We chose a gold nanowire (GNW) as
a nanofiller core based on excellent optical properties, high electronic
conductivity, and nontoxicity. Additionally, GNWs can be synthesized
at room temperature in aqueous conditions.10 Toward the creation of a highly effective nanofiller, we have focused
on the TiO2 coating of GNW, which realizes high dispersity
in TiO2 NP paste and reduces the resistance between TiO2 NPs and GNWs. We employed a genetically modified bifunctional
protein as a catalyst in synthesizing the nanostructure of TiO2–GNW.

Biological materials are among the most
promising “green”
nanomaterials because they can be synthesized on a large scale utilizing
self-assembly into nanostructured functional materials in benign conditions.
They can be sustainably produced from inedible biomass, such as cellulose
and hemicellulose.11 Because they are produced
by DNA information,12 they are identical
nanoblocks and their structures and functions can be modified by DNA
editing. Introducing the versatility of biomolecules into advanced
top-down processes, we have proposed and have been developing a biological
nanostructure fabrication process which we call the bionano process
(BNP).13−16

On the basis of the BNP, inorganic-recognizing peptides and
artificial
protein supramolecules with these peptides on the surface have been
used as core materials.17−21 Inorganic nanomaterials have been synthesized by simply mixing inorganic
precursors and artificial protein supramolecules, such as ferritin,
Dps, tobacco mosaic virus, and M13 phage.16,22−27 The artificial protein supramolecules worked as catalysts and templates
simultaneously and produced protein conjugates with nanomaterials,
such as nanoparticles and nanowires. When inorganic-binding peptides
are also decorated on the artificial protein surface, it is possible
to locate protein conjugates with nanomaterials on a specific area
of the substrate and selectively make a two-dimensional (2D) layer.19,28−30 The BNP approach has also been effective in the field
of inorganic hybrid material production, which improves the performance
of electronic devices. Applications cover wide and expanding areas,
such as random-access memory,31,32 Li-ion batteries,33,34 DSSCs,35,36 and thermoelectric devices.37

In this paper, we report the biomolecule-directed
synthesis of
TiO2–GNW and the investigation of their functionalities
for increasing the electrical conductivity of PSC photoelectrodes.
TiO2–GNW can trap light efficiently and transport
photogenerated electrons to a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer
quickly, boosting the performance of PSCs.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
schematically the construction process of a cage-shaped protein-templated
TiO2–GNW nanocomposite for PSCs. The nanocomposite
was fabricated in a solution through a procedure involving multiple
step deposition. GNWs synthesized in aqueous solution10 were mixed with a bifunctional cage-shaped protein solution.
The protein has both binding affinity toward GNWs and biomineralizing
activity for TiO2. The cage-shaped proteins coat a GNW
fully in a self-assembled manner and form a uniform 2D layer. After
protein coating, a TiO2 layer is formed from the Ti precursor
on the surface of the protein–GNW complex by using the biomineralization
activity of the cage-shaped proteins. The benign condition makes it
possible to form a native TiO2–GNW interface. Finally,
the TiO2–GNW nanocomposites are dispersed in the
TiO2 paste and used in the fabrication process of PSCs.
Using the obtained TiO2 paste, a solar cell device is fabricated
via a typical semiconductor process. Electron carriers generated by
photoexcitation at the conduction band of a Pb perovskite will be
quickly transferred into the GNW through a thin TiO2 layer.
The GNW efficiently collected and transported the electron carriers
to the FTO (Figure 1, right upper side).

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the TiO2-coated GNW synthesis
process
using the genetically modified cage-shaped protein supramolecules
with both GBPs and minTBP-1. The TiO2 NP paste containing
the nanowire was used for the TiO2 electrodes in PSCs.

To form a native interface between
the GNW and the TiO2 layer, we designed a novel bifunctional
protein based on the Listeria innocua Dps protein (named TDG1). Dps is
composed of 12 identical subunits that self-assemble into a stable
cage-shaped structure with an outer diameter of 9 nm and exposed N-
and C-terminal end on the outer surface of the cage.25,38 Titanium-compound-mineralizing peptide (minTBP-1, RKLPDA)20 and gold-binding peptide (GBP, MHGKTQATSGTIQS)21 were genetically added at the N- and C-terminal
of the Dps subunit and expected to assemble into dodecamer TDG1. TDG1
subunits were produced in the Escherichia coli fermentation process. After purification, cage-shaped structures
that are 9 nm in diameter were confirmed through transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) analysis (see the inset of Figure 2a). The result indicated that dodecamer TDG1s
were obtained. Twelve minTBP-1 and 12 GBP were displayed on the outer
surface, and TDG1 could bind with the gold surface and also work as
a catalyst for mineralizing titanium compounds in water.

the nanostructures. (a) TEM image of a TDG1–GNW
complex. The cage-shaped proteins completely coated the GNW surface.
The inset TEM image shows purified TDG1. The sample was stained with
3% PTA. (b,c) TEM image of a TiO2-coated GNW. The TiO2 layer was deposited on the GNW surface by TDG1 catalysis.
All scale bars are 50 nm.

Figure 2 shows
the
construction of the TiO2-coated GNW. First, TDG1 and GNW
were mixed by ultrasonication, and then the mixture was observed by
TEM with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) staining. In Figure 2a, the TEM images show a black
rod-shaped structure wrapped by a white layer, whereas a mixture of
GNW and native Dps contained only intact black rod-shaped structures
(Figure S1). Because the white layer existed
only in the mixture with TDG1 and the layer-contained cage-shaped
structures (Figure 2a), it was concluded that the layer consisted of TDG1s. The TDG1s
fully covered GNWs, suggesting that the gold-binding activity of TDG1
was strong enough to decorate the GNWs. It has been reported that
the GBP aptamer interacts with the gold atomic surface utilizing the
residues of methionine, histidine, and glutamine at positions 1, 2,
and 5, respectively.39 In the case of TDG1,
it was anticipated that not only plural amino acids but also several
of the 12 GBPs contributed to TDG1 adsorption. To evaluate the adsorption
enhancement by multiple GBPs, the adsorption activity of TDG1 to a
gold surface was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
system with an Au-deposited sensor. The dissociation constant (KD) value of the TDG1 protein supramolecule was
1.5 nM for the gold surface (Figure S2).
The value was better than a KD value (several
μM) for single GBP.39 The result
clearly showed that multiple GBP aptamers endowed TDG1 with higher
adsorption ability for gold and formed the TDG1–GNW complex
more efficiently.

The TiO2-coated GNW was constructed
under atmospheric
pressure and at low temperature using the TDG1–GNW complex
as a precursor. We employed a two-step TiO2 mineralization
as follows. First, utilizing the biomineralization ability of minTBP-1,
the titanium compound layer was mineralized on the GNW surface in
a solution of precursor, titanium(IV) bis-(ammonium lactato)-dihydroxide
(Ti[BALDH], Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).27,30 Second, the
obtained GNW with titanium compound was immersed and incubated in
titanium alkoxide solution at 100 or 200 °C.35 The titanium compound produced from the first step was
mostly amorphous. Nevertheless, Raman spectroscopy analysis of precipitates
produced by the two-step TiO2 mineralization showed signals
attributed to the anatase phase TiO240 from both samples at 100 or 200 °C (Figure S3). Figure 2b,c shows TEM images of the obtained TiO2-layer-coated
GNW by a two-step TiO2 mineralization. The elements of
the nanostructure were analyzed by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) and the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). EDS mapping
shows that gold (red color in Figure S4) was localized in a central fibrous structure and that titanium
(green color in Figure S4) was localized
around the fiber. Distribution of titanium and oxygen elements from
the TiO2-layer-covered GNW could also be confirmed by EELS
mapping (Figure 3).
The results clearly show that the nanostructure contained gold and
titanium. By contrast, the TiO2-coated GNW could not be
obtained without TDG1 (Figure S5). Large
precipitation of titanium compounds was produced in a condition without
protein catalysis, and the precipitation which contained GNW was observed.
The thickness of the TiO2 layer on the GNWs was on the
order of 10 nm, which was around the same as the TDG1 9 nm diameter.
The gap of the TiO2 layer and the GNW surface was not observed
in high-resolution TEM analysis (Figure 2c). Any gap must have been less than 1 nm.
Therefore, there were no barriers for carrier electrons to transfer
between the TiO2 layer and the GNW. Because the residual
TDG1 in the TiO2 layer of the complex was completely eliminated
during the baking process of PSCs at 500 °C in air, a carrier
transport was not inhibited by residual proteins in the complex.

of the nanowire. Gold, oxide, and titanium were detected
in the fibrous structure. The scale bars are 50 nm.

The organic–inorganic perovskite PSC material
contains iodide
atoms. Because gold materials are dissolved in iodide solution,41 the stability of the TiO2-coated
GNW to iodine solution was evaluated. While an uncoated GNW quickly
dissolved in iodide solution, the TiO2-coated GNW maintained
the structure for 30 min (Figure S6). Specifically,
the TiO2 coating improved the stability of GNW, and the
TiO2-coated GNW contained in the mp-TiO2 layer
can be expected to show stable electrical characteristics in the PSC.

In a PSC with a mesoporous network of TiO2, the porous
TiO2 helps photoexcited electrons transfer to a TCO layer.6,42 Therefore, a reduction in the resistance of the mp-TiO2 layer can boost the performance of PSCs. Leijtens showed the performance
improvement by decreasing the thickness and resistance of the mp-TiO2 layer.43 It is also known that
well-dispersed nanowires lead to efficient electrical pathway networks
in a TiO2 matrix and improve photoelectrode performance
in DSSCs.35,44−47 The efficient electrical pathway
network reduces the resistance in the photoelectrodes and improves
photocurrent density. The simple mixing of the intact conductive materials
and the TiO2 NPs, however, causes phase separation in the
paste and induces not only a spatial but also an electrical gap between
the materials, which causes interfacial carrier–hole recombination.35,47,48 Because the TiO2-coated
GNW interacts with the TiO2 NPs in the same way, the TiO2-coated GNWs are dispersed well in mp-TiO2. The
coating of GNW with TiO2 is expected to reduce interfacial
resistance between TiO2 and GNW surfaces and suppress interfacial
carrier–hole recombination. These effects decrease the internal
resistance of photoelectrodes and increase the fill factor and current
density of the solar cells. The GNWs dispersed in mp-TiO2 enhance light absorption depending on their nanostructure5,49 and plasmonic effect50 and can be expected
to increase the performance of solar cells. We checked the dispersity
of the TiO2-coated GNW in the TiO2 paste by
mixing them in a microtube. There was no phase separation, and a homogeneous
paste was formed, suggesting that the TiO2-coated GNWs
were well-dispersed in the paste. However, it was difficult to measure
the dispersity quantitatively because of the low concentration and
high viscosity of the paste. Consequently, the development of a novel
method of quantitative measurement for the dispersion in the paste
is needed.

The effect of the TiO2-coated GNW in a
PSC photoelectrode
was evaluated using an AM 1.5 solar simulator. First, to optimize
the TiO2–GNW concentration in the mp-TiO2 matrix, we assembled and evaluated the PSCs with photoelectrodes
prepared by the TiO2 NP paste containing TiO2-coated GNW at various concentrations. As a result, regardless of
the presence or absence of the TiO2 coating, the photoelectrode
with 0.3 wt % nanowire showed good performances. The fill factor and
PCE of the PSC with 0.3 wt % uncoated GNW were less than 90% of that
of the PSC with 0.3 wt % TiO2–GNW, suggesting that
the inner resistance of the PSC with uncoated GNW was high. As demonstrated
in Figure 4, the photoelectrode
with 0.3 wt % TiO2–GNW achieved the highest PCE
of 15.1% under AM 1.5-type solar illumination at 100 mW cm–2. The short-circuit current density (JSC) was 21.0 mA cm–2, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) was 1.06, and the fill factor was 0.68.
Compared with a typical PSC, all three elements (i.e., JSC, VOC, and fill factor)
were improved in the cell with the TiO2-coated GNW (Figure 4a and Table 1). Because the incorporation
of the TiO2-coated GNW boosted an external quantum efficiency
(EQE) at 350–750 nm (Figure 4b), the improvement of the JSC value was considered to be due to the increase in carrier collection
efficiency, a light-trapping effect, and/or a localized plasmonic
effect caused by the conductive GNW. However, there was no imbalance
in the increase of EQE, and the localized plasmonic effect, which
was expected to have a large effect on the long-wavelength side, was
considered to be small in the PSC with TiO2-coated GNWs.
Although the JSC increased with a simple
mixing of conductive materials such as graphene in the mp-TiO2 layer, it was apparent that the interfacial carrier–hole
recombination occurs at a conductive material and TiO2 interface.48 The interfacial recombination increased the
photoelectrode resistance, resulting in a decrease in the VOC and fill factor of PSCs. On the other hand,
the coating of the GNW surface with TiO2-coated GNW can
be expected to suppress the carrier–hole recombination loss
at this interface and increase the VOC and fill factor by a reduction of recombination current.

We confirmed the reduction of the photoelectrode resistance
by
the incorporation of the TiO2-coated GNWs. The internal
resistances of PSCs were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) under irradiated condition. The Nyquist plot shows a single
arc at high frequency (ranging from 0.5 kHz to 1 MHz). Previous work
has also shown that the arc at high frequencies represents the charge
transport resistance at the mp-TiO2/perovskite matrix and
resistance in the 101–2 Ω order.51,52 In these reports, another arc-corresponded HTL was observed in a
lower-frequency range. However, it was difficult to measure below
0.5 kHz in our system, and we could not measure the effect of the
incorporation of TiO2–GNW in the mp-TiO2 layer for the second arc. We analyzed the EIS using an RQ circuit
model with a constant phase element (CPE), focusing on a capacitor
and resistances derived from the measurable mp-TiO2 layer
(Figure S7). By the incorporation of the
TiO2-coated GNWs, the resistance of the mp-TiO2 matrix was reduced from 83 to 66 Ω. The photogenerated electron
carriers were collected and transferred to the FTO through the GNWs
efficiently. The corresponding n index of the CPE
of the equivalent circuit was 1, indicating that the CPE was a simple
capacitor. The capacitance value of the PSC with the TiO2-coated GNW was 2.3 μF/cm2, and there was no significant
difference from the capacitance of the typical PSC (2.1 μF/cm2). The TiO2-coated GNW addition may not cause an
increase in interfaces or nonuniformities in mp-TiO2 to
cause a change of capacitance components. The increase in JSC was attributed to the decreasing resistance
of the mp-TiO2 matrix by the TiO2-coated GNWs.
This indicates that TiO2-coated GNWs can reduce the resistance
of photoelectrodes and increase the PCE of PSCs. Because the stabilities
of our PSC devices were very low, measurements proceeded within 1
hour from the cell assembly. The low stability of the cells may be
caused by gold-migration-induced degradation. Gold from the electrode
passes through the HTL and accumulates within the perovskite layer
at 75 °C under sunlight for several hours and decreases the performance
of PSCs.53 To improve the stability of
the PSCs, other metals, such as Au/Cu alloy or Ag, may be used for
metal electrodes. Furthermore, although the stability was improved
by the TiO2 coating, degradation of the TiO2–GNWs might occur by the gold migration during long-time incubation
at high temperature. Chemically stable materials, for example, carbon
nanotubes,27,54 may be superior as an electrical
nanofiller in the PSC electrodes.

Results in this study demonstrate
that the well-dispersed TiO2-coated GNW in the mp-TiO2 layer increased the
EQE of PSCs in the range of 350–750 nm and decreased the photoelectrode
resistance by 12%. The TiO2-coated GNW leads to the efficient
collection of photogenerated electrons from perovskite and improved
the high power performance of the PSC devices. The well-dispersed
TiO2-coated GNWs can be constructed by using the artificially
designed biological molecule, TDG1, as a catalyst. The TDG1 selectively
modified the GNWs without covalent functionalization of the gold surface
which made it possible to wrap the anatase-form TiO2 layer
on the surface of the GNWs by a two-step TiO2 mineralization
including 2 h annealing at temperatures as low as 100 °C. Because
the genetic engineering technique can construct various functional
artificial proteins easily, this protein-based process can be easily
applied to the synthesis of other functional nanomaterials for applications
such as in batteries, supercapacitors, and biosensors.

Materials and
Methods
Preparation of the Artificial Protein
A cage-shaped
protein gene was amplified by whole-vector PCR using oligonucleotides
(5′-TTTGGATCCT TAGCTCTGAA TGGTGCCGCT GGTCGCCTGG GTTTTGCCAT
GTTCTAATGG AGCTTTTCCA AG-3′ and 5′-TTTGGATCCG AATTCGAGCT
CCGTCG-3′) as primers and pET20-TD27 as a template plasmid. The PCR product was digested with BamHI,
and the resulting DNA fragment was self-ligated to construct pET20-TDG1
encoding TDG1, a Dps variant fused with minTBP-1 (RKLPDA)20 at the N-terminal and GBP (HGKTQATSGTIQS)21 at the C-terminal ends. TDG1 was overproduced
in E. coli using a previously reported
method.27 Briefly, E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed by pET20-TDG1 was cultivated in LB medium
with ampicillin (100 mg L–1) at 37 °C for 24
h. For the extraction of TDG1 from the bacteria, the cells were disrupted
by ultrasonication and the cell suspension was centrifuged at 6500
rpm for 5 min to remove the cell debris. The supernatant was warmed
in a water bath at 60 °C for 20 min, and the extract was centrifuged
at 6500 rpm for 5 min to precipitate insoluble materials again. The
heat-treated supernatant was filtered and applied to an anion-exchanger
column (HiLoad 16/10 Q Sepharose High Performance, GE Healthcare,
USA), and TDG1 was fractionated by NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl buffer
(50 mM and pH 8.0). The extraction of the anion-exchanger column was
purified utilizing the gel filtration column (HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl
S-300 High Resolution, GE Healthcare, USA) with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 8.0). The purified TDG1 was analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (Any kD, Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gels, Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) with samples and molecular markers (Novex
Sharp Pre-Stained Protein Standard, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
MA, USA).

Nanowire Construction
The GNW, which was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (cat. 716944, diam × L 30
nm × 4500 nm, dispersion (H2O), contains cetrimonium
bromide as a stabilizer, MO, USA), was repeatedly washed with hot
water five times using centrifugation and pipetting. The washed GNW
and TDG1 were mixed in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at a final concentration
of 0.1 mg mL–1 each, and 1 mL of the mixture was
treated by ultrasonic sonication (1 s on/3 s off and 20% amplitude
at 400 W; Digital Sonifier 450 with Microtips, Branson, USA) in an
ice bath for 5 min. After the ultrasonic treatment, a precipitate,
which was a TDG1–GNW complex, was collected by centrifugation
and dispersed in 1 mL of MES–NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0). Titanium(IV)
bis-(ammonium lactato)-dihydroxide (Ti[BALDH], Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA) was added to the TDG1–GNW solution at a final concentration
of 2.5 wt %. After a 6 h incubation at 25 °C, the precipitate
was washed twice with water. The wash process was sequentially repeated
with ethanol twice to remove the water. The precipitate dispersed
in ethanol was mixed with 0.001 wt % titanium(IV) tetrabutoxide (Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, USA) and was incubated at 100–200 °C for 2 h. Finally,
we obtained the TiO2–GNW nanocomposites by using
the protein as a catalyst.

Adsorption Analysis of TDG1 by QCM
A QCM system with
gold-sensor chip (AFFINIX QNμ, INITIUM Inc., Kanagawa, Japan)
was used for protein adsorption analysis. After washing the sensor
chip with piranha solution (a 3:1 mixture of H2SO4 with H2O2), the chip was immersed into a potassium
phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0) at 25 °C. After 1 h incubation,
the protein sample was injected into the QCM-sensor cell. The final
concentrations of proteins used for the measurement were in the 4–65
nM range. The resonance frequency of a sensor was measured with a
resolution of 1 Hz at a sampling interval of 0.1 s. The AQUA software
(ver. 3, INITIUM Inc., Japan) was then used to determine the dissociation
constant, KD. The theoretical molecular
weights of TDG1 (12-fold) used 240 kDa. The change of resonance frequency
(f) was described by the following equation55  Δft, the resonance frequency decrease at time t; ΔfMax, the maximum
of the resonance frequency decrease; [P], the 12-metric protein concentration
in the reaction buffer; kon, the binding
rate constant; and koff, the dissociate
rate constant.

Characterization of Nanomaterials
Protein and nanowire
nanostructures were analyzed by TEM (JEM-2200FS, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
The EELS mapping and the EDS of TiO2-coated GNWs were analyzed
on a carbon-coated copper TEM grid by JEM-3100FEF (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
Raman spectra were recorded on an NRS-2100 spectrophotometer (JASCO,
MD, USA) using laser excitation at 514.5 nm.

Fabrication of PSCs
We assembled PSCs following previous
studies with slight modification.56−58 An FTO-coated glass
substrate (1.5 cm2 and thickness 1.8 mm; AGC Fabritech,
Japan) was etched with zinc powder and 2 M HCl. The substrate was
then washed by ultrasonic sonication with alkaline detergent, water,
and acetone. The substrate was incubated at room temperature for drying
and was treated by UV/O3 at 115 °C for 30 min. To
deposit a CL-TiO2 layer on the substrate, 50 μL of
1-butanol containing 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) was dropped and spin-coated onto the FTO
substrate at 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 2000 rpm for
40 s. After coating, the substrate was baked in air at 125 °C
for 5 min. An mp-TiO2 layer was then prepared on the CL-TiO2/FTO substrate using a mixture containing TiO2–GNW
and TiO2 nanoparticles (15–18 nm in diameter). To
prepare the mixture, an ethanol containing dispersed TiO2–GNWs was added to a mixture of ethanol/TiO2 paste
in a volume ratio of 5:1 (PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd.,
Kanagawa, Japan) containing about 14 wt % TiO2 nanoparticles.
The mixture (50 μL) was dropped and spin-coated onto the CL-TiO2/FTO substrate at 1000 rpm for 5 s and then at 5000 rpm for
25 s. The substrate was baked in air at 125 °C for 5 min and
then at 450 °C for 60 min. Once cooled, a perovskite layer was
synthesized on the substrate in a dry box (dew point < −65
°C and O2 concentration < 5 ppm). For the preparation
of a perovskite precursor solution, 0.159 g (1.00 mmol) of methylammonium
iodide (CH3NH3I, Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd., Japan), 0.461 g (1.00 mmol) of lead(II) iodide (Tokyo Chemical
Industry Co., Ltd., Japan), and 67.2 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide
(Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) were dissolved in 635 μL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA) and then stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The perovskite
precursor solution (50 μL) was dispensed onto the pre-prepared
mp-TiO2/CL-TiO2/FTO substrate by spin-coating
at 4000 rpm for 25 s. After 6 s of spin-coating, 500 μL of diethyl
ether was then added dropwise to the spinning substrate. The coated
substrate was then placed on a hot plate set at 65 °C for 1 min
and 100 °C for 2 min to allow Pb perovskite crystal formation.
The polymeric hole transporter spiro-OMeTAD (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA)
was dissolved at 7 wt % in chlorobenzene with tert-butylpyridine (200 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(Li-TFSI, 30 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) additives, and 40 μL
of the spiro-OMeTAD solution was spun-cast onto the perovskite substrate
at 1000 rpm for 4 s and then at 4000 rpm for 26 s. Finally, an 80
nm thick gold electrode was deposited through a shadow mask using
a resistive heating vapor deposition system.

Characterization of PSCs
The current density–voltage
(J–V) characteristics of
solar cells were measured with an EQE measurement system (CEP-2000RR,
Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd., Japan) under AM 1.5 condition (100 mW cm–2). The cell measurement area was 9 mm2.
The bias voltage was swept from −0.2 to 1.2 V. The voltage
step and delay time of the photocurrent were 50 mV and 3 s, respectively.
EQE was also measured by CEP-2000RR under 2.5 mW cm–2 illumination. The measurement wavelength range was 300–900
nm, as measured every 10 nm. EIS were measured using a potentiostat
SP-50 (BioLogic, France) with a frequency range of 0.5 kHz to 1 MHz
under AM 1.5 condition and analyzed with EC-lab Express software (BioLogic,
France). The characteristics of the PSCs were measured at room temperature.
