We
report on a novel lipid bilayer system, in which a lateral bias
can be applied in addition to a conventional transmembrane voltage.
Freestanding bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) doped with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were formed in a microaperture,
around which metal electrodes were deposited. Using this system, it
was possible to modulate and amplify photoinduced transmembrane currents
by applying a lateral bias along the BLM. The results indicate that
the microfabricated Si chip with embedded electrodes is a promising
platform for the formation of transistor-like devices based on PCBM-doped
BLMs and have potential for use in a wide variety of nanohybrid devices.

==== Body
Introduction
The bilayer lipid membrane
(BLM), a main component of cell membranes,
can be formed by a self-assemble process. Such membranes are ultrathin,
with thicknesses of only 3–5 nm, and, at the same time, demonstrate
an ultrahigh ionic resistance (>100 GΩ). The BLMs can be
readily
functionalized by incorporating nanomaterials into them and can be
used in various biological applications. For example, BLMs containing
ion channel proteins have been utilized in biosensing and biological
applications;1−7 α-hemolysin protein has been incorporated into BLMs to form
a nanosized hole for DNA and RNA decoding,8−10 and ultrashort
carbon nanotubes have been inserted into BLMs for molecular sensing
and selective ion transport.11−13 Recently, nanohybrid optoelectronic
devices prepared by using a combination of photosensitive nanoparticles
and BLMs have attracted considerable interest. BLMs, functionalized
with gold nanoparticles, have been demonstrated to show reversible
photoresponses.14 We also previously reported
that an organic semiconducting material, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), can be used to dope BLMs to form
a photodetector-like device.15 In solid-state
semiconductor technologies, the gate bias is usually used to regulate
and magnify the current flowing through the semiconductors. It is
possible to further improve the performance of BLM-based devices by
introducing a “gate bias” to the BLM system.

Here,
for the first time, we report that the performance of nanohybrid
devices based on BLMs can be modulated by applying a lateral voltage
to fullerene-doped BLMs. We fabricated a novel BLM system in which
a lateral bias voltage inside the BLM can be applied. We then investigated
the effect of the bias voltage on photoinduced transmembrane currents.

Results
and Discussion
Si chips having a circular microaperture were
fabricated, according
to the procedures previously described.2 To apply a lateral voltage to the BLMs, two metal electrodes were
formed on Si chips using the process shown in Figure 1. The center of the metal mask was first
carefully aligned with the aperture of the chip (Figure 1a) under a microscope. A layer
of aluminum (Al) with a thickness of 30 nm was then thermally evaporated
through the metal mask (Figure 1b). As a passivation layer to prevent direct contact between
metal electrodes and aqueous solutions, a thin layer of SiO2 was then sputtered at the center part of the chip (Figure 1c). The two edge regions of
the Al layer were exposed for use as electrical contacts. Finally,
a fluoropolymer CYTOP was cast to cover the Si side of the chip, as
described previously (Figure 1d).2 Photographs of the fabricated
Si chip and a microscopic image of the electrodes are shown in Figure 1e,f, respectively.
The diameter of the aperture was 40 μm and the distance between
the two electrodes was 30 μm. The electrodes reached the edge
of the aperture to ensure that an effective lateral bias was applied
to the BLMs. The final Si chip was then silanized by treating with
2% (v/v) (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl) dimethylchlorosilane
in anhydrous toluene for 6 h at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled
glove box.

chip with electrodes. The size of the chip is 5 mm × 23.8 mm.
Photograph of the Si chip and a microscopic image of the electrodes
are shown in (e) and (f).

The experimental setup for measuring the transmembrane photoresponse
under lateral bias is illustrated in Figure 2. The Si chip with Al electrodes was used
as a support for forming BLMs by applying the so-called “folding”
method, as reported previously.1,2,16 Solvent-free BLMs were formed across the microaperture from diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DPhPC) solution with and without PCBM, as described in a previous
report.15

Figure 2 Schematic of the experimental setup used
for the measurement of
photoresponse under a lateral bias. The inset shows the enlarged schematic
of the PCBM-doped freestanding lipid membrane.

We first investigated the formation of BLMs across the microfabricated
apertures around which Al electrodes and SiO2 passivation
layers were deposited. Only the Si chips in which the resistance between
the two Al electrodes in air was over 200 GΩ were used for the
experiments to confirm that there was no leakage current through the
surface or the bulk of the Si chip. After BLM formation, the resistance
across the BLMs, as measured between the two Ag/AgCl electrodes, was
in excess of 200 GΩ, showing that highly resistive BLMs were
formed, even when the additional Al and SiO2 layers have
been deposited around the microaperture. The resistance between the
two Al electrodes was still in excess of 200 GΩ after the BLM
formation, indicating that the thin SiO2 layer acted as
an insulating layer, electrically separating the Al electrodes from
the buffer solutions.

To understand how a lateral bias applied
to the Al electrodes can
affect the electrical characteristics of a BLM, we measured the resistance
and the capacitance of the BLMs (recorded between the two Ag/AgCl
electrodes) under different lateral alternating current (AC) bias
conditions. To reduce the noise due to the AC bias source, a homemade
battery-powered AC source (11.8 kHz sine wave) was connected to the
two Al electrodes. As shown in Figure 3a, when the AC bias was increased from 0 to 3 V (peak
to peak), the resistance across the BLM remained essentially constant
at over 200 GΩ, indicating that the application of a lateral
bias did not weaken the ability of the BLM to function as a barrier
to ion permeation. On the other hand, the capacitance of the BLM decreased
with increasing lateral bias (n = 6). It is possible
that the lateral AC bias could change the ion distribution around
the BLM, or change the dipole potential of BLM, leading to a reduction
in capacitance.17,18 However, further studies will
be needed to confirm this assumption. We also recorded the electrical
characteristics of PCBM-doped BLMs under different lateral AC bias
values. As shown in Figure 3b, the resistance of the PCBM-doped BLMs under an AC bias
was similar to that of BLMs composed of only DPhPC lipid, implying
that the PCBM molecules did not affect the high resistance of the
BLMs under an AC bias. The capacitance of the PCBM-doped BLMs decreased
with increasing lateral bias (n = 3), showing the
same trend as the capacitance of pure BLMs. However, it should be
noted that the capacitance of the PCBM-doped BLM was measurably lower
than that of the pure DPhPC BLM.

Figure 3 Measured resistance and capacitance of
pure lipid bilayers (a)
and PCBM-doped lipid bilayers (b) under different lateral bias conditions.
Membrane resistance higher than 200 GΩ was plotted as 200 GΩ.

Since the PCBM-doped BLMs are photosensitive,15 it is possible to form a phototransistor-like
device by
using the lateral bias to regulate the photocurrent. Therefore, we
also measured the transmembrane photocurrent of the hybrid membrane
under an AC bias. Figure 4a shows the photoresponses of the BLM composed of pure DPhPC
under repeated illumination and different lateral bias. Under a lateral
bias of 0–3 V, immediately after the light was switched on,
the transmembrane current showed a transient positive shift, followed
by gradual downward decay. After the light was switched off, the transmembrane
current demonstrated a reverse trend, first a negative shift and then
a gradual upward decay. The current did not reach a steady state within
the 1 s period of light on/off time. This could be attributed to the
high capacitance and high resistance of DPhPC membranes as shown in Figure 3a, since the time
constant of the relaxation is determined by the product of the resistance
and the capacitance. As illustrated in Figure S1, 3 s after switching the light off/on, the transmembrane
currents converged to their original value before the switching, indicating
that the lipid-only membrane would not induce a steady-state photoresponse.
The results are in agreement with a previous report that the DPhPC
membrane would not produce a steady-state photoresponse.14,15 Similarly, no significant steady-state photoresponse was induced
under a different lateral bias of 1–3 V, implying that the
transmembrane current at the pure DPhPC membrane could not be modulated
by the lateral bias.

Figure 4 Transmembrane photoresponses of lipid-only membrane (a)
and PCBM-doped
lipid membrane (b) under different lateral bias (0–3 V).

On the other hand, as shown in Figure 4b, the current signal from
the PCBM-doped
membrane reached a steady state within the 1 s period of illumination
under lateral bias (1–3 V). When the light was turned off,
the transmembrane current immediately returned to its original light-off
value. The current response upon illumination (difference between
light-off and light-on currents) increased from 11.6 to 39.4 pA with
an increase in the lateral bias from 1 to 3 V. As shown in Figure S2, the averaged current response, as
calculated based on three experiment cycles, was positively correlated
with the applied lateral bias, indicating that the lateral bias regulates
and amplifies the transmembrane current. In the absence of a lateral
bias, as shown in Figure 4b, the transmembrane current exhibited a gradually decaying
upward shift upon illumination, which is similar to that of the nondoped
membrane. The slower positive transient could also be attributed to
the larger capacitance without the lateral bias than that at higher
lateral voltages (see Figure 3b). These results demonstrate that a phototransistor-like
device could be formed based on freestanding hybrid BLMs.

The
mechanism responsible for regulating the current by a lateral
bias is still not clear. It appears that PCBM or lipid molecules are
not structurally altered under a lateral bias, since no transmembrane
leakage of pure and PCBM-doped BLMs was detected, as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, the
modulation of photoresponse could be attributed to the effects of
light illumination and the lateral electric field that is simultaneously
applied to the PCBM-doped BLMs. It has been reported that the photoluminescence
and absorption of CdSe nanoparticles that are incorporated into a
polymer film would be changed due to the external electric field.19 Similar behaviors have also been observed in
other systems that comprise nanoparticles.20−22 Therefore,
we conclude that the electrical field introduced by the lateral Al
electrodes in our experimental setup may have altered the optical
characteristics of the PCBM molecules in the BLMs, leading to a phototransistor-like
transmembrane current response that is regulated by the lateral bias.
More detailed experiments will be needed to confirm the proposed mechanism,
which would include comparing the absorption/photoluminescence spectra
of the hybrid membranes under different lateral bias values and measuring
the distribution of membrane potential using fluorescent labels.

Conclusions
We fabricated a Si chip equipped with two metal electrodes as the
support for BLMs. It was confirmed that the additional electrodes
and insulating layers around the aperture of the Si chip did not affect
the characteristics of the BLMs formed on them. When the lateral bias
was applied to the two electrodes on the Si chip, the nondoped and
PCBM-doped BLMs maintained high resistance. However, as the lateral
bias increased, the capacitance of the BLMs reduced. Without PCBM
incorporation, the BLM did not demonstrate a clear response to light
illumination or lateral bias. On the other hand, the PCBM-doped BLM
showed photoresponse under light illumination and lateral bias. We
were able to modulate the transmembrane current by changing the lateral
bias. These results indicate that the BLM is a promising platform
for hybrid nanodevices.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
DPhPC and PCBM were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipid Inc. and Frontier Carbon Corporation, respectively.
The BLMs were formed in symmetrical buffer solutions (2 M KCl, 10
mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.2 with
KOH), where two Ag/AgCl electrodes were placed at each side. After
the BLM formation, current recordings were performed using an Axopatch
200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices). The resistance across
the BLMs was calculated based on the currents observed at the transmembrane
voltage of +100 mV and −100 mV. Capacitance was measured by
applying transmembrane ramp voltage pulses of 1 V/s at a holding potential
of 0 mV. The BLMs were then repeatedly illuminated by means of an
LED light with a center wavelength of 850 nm (Solis High Power LED,
Thorlabs) with on and off times of 1 s, which was controlled by a
multifunction generator (WF1974, NF Corporation). The applied voltage
at the vertical direction during the measurement was −1 V unless
otherwise specified.
