When using non-natural amino acids
in computational simulations
of proteins, it is necessary to ensure appropriate parameterization
of the new amino acids toward the creation of appropriate input files.
In particular, the charges on the atoms may have to be derived de
novo and ad hoc for the new species. As there are many variables in
the charge derivation process, an investigation was devised to compare
different approaches and determine their effect on simulations. This
was done with the purpose to identify the methods which produced results
compatible with the existing parameters. It was found in this study
that all analyzed charge derivation methods reproduce with sufficient
accuracy the literature values and can be used with confidence when
parameterizing novel species.

Introduction
The reliability of
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is dependent
on the underlying force field,1 which is
a collection of parameters including the strengths of various interactions,
the charges on the atoms, the lengths of bonds, and so forth. Therefore,
obtaining high-quality parameters is one of the first steps in ensuring
that simulations are reliable. MD packages such as AMBER,2 CHARMM,3 GROMACS,4 NAMD,5 and many others
use different varieties of the basic force field,6 some of which may be specific to classes of biological
molecules or to the computational program being used. These force
fields may have different parameters that result from the differences
in the methods employed for their derivation.

Parameters have
been derived for the standard sets of amino acids
and nucleic acids, sugars and lipids, and also for many kinds of functional
groups in small molecule ligands. Indeed, general algorithms have
been developed to parameterize new molecules that enable speed in
high-throughput studies. However, while the parameters for the covalent
interactions such as bond lengths, angles, dihedrals, and noncovalent
van der Waals parameters are transferable from the general datasets
that already exist,7 the same is not the
case for charges, which are very much dependent on the context and
hence need to be calculated for every new molecule. Although some
general rules have been derived for their transferability,8 the paucity of experimental data to benchmark
the charge datasets (either directly or through the prediction of
properties dependent on charges) can make this issue problematic.
The matter is further complicated because a wide variety of methods
have been used for the purpose of charge derivation, regularly producing
subtly different results. Therefore, we have decided to review and
compare the existing methods in representative test cases and establish
how charges derived with different variables measure with those reported
in the literature. We hope this can help understand which of the current
approaches is best suited for parameterizing nonstandard amino acids.

The charges for a series of representative natural amino acids
were derived following as much as possible the procedure reported
in the literature; the values that we used as the benchmark are taken
from the AMBER force field FF14SB9 (which
are the same as in FF12SB and FF99SB10).
Two methods were used for the derivation of charges: the restrained
electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting procedure,11 which was originally employed in the derivation of the
AMBER force field charges, and AM1-BCC,12 which is used by the antechamber tool part of AMBERTools. MD simulations
were then carried out separately using these derived charges and compared
to simulations carried out using the original charges from AMBER.

Derivation Methods
Perhaps the most commonly
used technique in the derivation of charges is RESP13 fitting, where point charges are assigned to atoms based
on a grid of electrostatic potential points derived through quantum
mechanical (QM) methods. It is an extension of the ESP method and
is more powerful, creating charges of higher quality because it is
less dependent on the molecular conformation.14 Although it is an obvious approximation to treat charges as fixed,
immutable, and located in a single point, it is necessary within the
context of MD. There are other methods for deriving charges such as
from Mulliken analysis15 or NBO analysis,16 but for our purposes, we only considered RESP
as it is the one used in the charge derivation of FF99SB and its successors,11 and our aim was to be as compatible as possible
with the established procedures. One final remark must be made about
polarization and the effects that arise from it, which are generally
not accounted for in the RESP approach. Some force fields, such as
Amoeba,17 do try to incorporate these effects
in their parameters, but this was not done for the FF14SB force field
and its predecessors. Our investigation aims to follow the protocols
laid out in the literature and therefore does not explicitly take
into account polarization. This could be an interesting future venue
of exploration to further improve our understanding on how to parameterize
amino acids.

We used the programs NWChem18 and Red Server19 to perform
the calculations necessary for RESP, each of which present different
approaches to charge derivation. NWChem is a suite of tools that allows
for many types of QM calculations; for the purposes of this study,
we used the geometry optimization and the ESP charge fitting protocols
to generate atomic charges for our systems. NWChem can be downloaded
and run as an executable on common desktop machines and is relatively
quick and easy to use. However, only a single conformation can be
used as an input at any one time. It has been shown that charges vary
with molecular conformation,20 thus necessitating
the use of multiple conformations to obtain robust results.21 To investigate the effect of conformation on
the derived charges, the Red Server package was also used; it is an
online server and it is a little more complicated to use than NWChem.
Both NWChem and Red Server allow for the use of several different
basis sets and QM methods for the RESP fitting procedure. For the
derivation of charges, we focused on perhaps the most commonly used
basis set, 6-31G*, and employed both Hartree–Fock (HF) and
the density functional theory exchange correlation function, B3LYP.
Although the former method is the one most traditionally used for
this task, because of a fortuitous cancellation of errors,22 B3LYP is also employed.23 The other charge derivation procedure we tested is the semiempirical
QM approach using the AM1-BCC charge method,12 as used by programs such as MOPAC.24 It
is meant to emulate RESP fitting and provide a faster alternative;
conceptually, it is similar to RESP but the implementation is much
quicker. It is an approximation which can satisfactorily describe
the underlying electronic features and although not as accurate as
RESP,25 it does so in a fraction of the
time. This method is also available as part of AMBER and is employed
to derive charges of small molecule ligands.26

As previously mentioned, the conformation of the molecule
has a
great effect on the derived electrostatic potential:20 the same molecule in different orientations may produce
different charge distributions depending on local polarization, steric
clashes, and other similar effects. In order to obviate this problem,
the literature protocol uses multiple conformations to describe each
amino acid.11,27 These conformations, differing
in backbone dihedrals, were obtained through a statistical analysis
of amino acids in crystallized proteins. It was possible to do this
for all natural amino acids, but it is, for obvious reasons, much
harder to apply to non-natural ones, for which there would not be
a large enough database to mine statistically relevant conformations.
In our investigation, as we have only examined natural amino acids,
we used the conformations reported in the literature with the intention
of determining how this approach can then be applied to residues for
which there is less data available.

Test Case Methodology
The amino acids isoleucine (Ile,
I), lysine (Lys, K), glutamic acid (Glu, E), glutamine (Gln, Q), tyrosine
(Tyr, Y), and phenylalanine (Phe, F) were chosen as they represent
nonpolar, polar, positive, negative, and aromatic amino acids. Each
amino acid (X) was capped using an acetyl group (Ace) at the N-terminus
and an N-methylamide (Nme) at the C-terminus, resulting
in Ace-X-Nme. Following the spirit of the derivation of charges for
FF14SB,11 different combinations of φ,
ψ, χ,1 and χ2 dihedrals were
used to generate αR or C5 conformations,
as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 αR (left) and C5 (right) conformations
of isoleucine.

The RESP and AM1-BCC
charges were generated separately for each
of the two different conformations and were also subsequently averaged.
As a result, 11 sets of derived charges were obtained: AM1-BCC αR, AM1-BCC C5, the average of these two sets of
charges, RESP αR with HF, RESP αR with B3LYP, RESP C5 with HF, RESP C5 with
B3LYP, the average of the single conformation HF charges, the average
of the single conformation B3LYP charges, the multiconformation HF
charges, and the multiconformation B3LYP charges.

In each case,
if possible, the backbone atoms of N, H, C, and O
were restrained to the literature values11 (for neutral residues: N = −0.4157, H = 0.2719, C = 0.5973,
and O = −0.5679; for positively charged residues: N = −0.3479,
H = 0.2747, C = 0.7341, and O = −0.5894; and for negatively
charged residues: N = −0.5163, H = 0.2936, C = 0.5366, and
O = −0.5819), as the philosophy is to have a charge derivation
that is as modular as possible. For AM1-BCC, which does not do this
automatically, this step was not performed, which leads to those four
atoms having different charges from the other methods. All chemically
equivalent atoms, such as hydrogens attached to the same carbon or
carbons occupying the same relative position in a ring were constrained,
using symmetry, to have the same charge.

The obtained charges
were all very similar to each other across
individual amino acids. This means that, for example, the charges
of each atom of the glutamic acid residue were consistent and differed
usually only in the second significant digit onward; the carboxylic
carbon had a strongly positive charge compensated by the negative
charges of the oxygens, whereas the β-carbon and γ-carbon
and their hydrogens were weakly charged, and so on. Similar patterns
could be seen for all the other amino acids, with functional groups
carrying the expected charge distributions, that is, similar to those
reported in the literature. This is perhaps a testament to the robustness
and versatility of both RESP and AM1-BCC.

All of the charges
were obtained easily and automatically; by far,
the fastest method was AM1-BCC, which operated within seconds, although
the inability to restrain backbone charges is a drawback. NWChem and
Red Server both took similar amounts of time, with the expected advantages
and disadvantages inherent to obtaining and running a program on a
machine and accessing a web server, respectively. The only exception
is the multiconformational charge derivation of lysine, carried out
on the Red Server, which did not work with any combination of parameters
(neither with B3LYP or HF) nor by changing the convergence criteria.
The program never managed to reach a minimized structure, and thus
it was not considered in this study.

Once the charges were obtained,
it was a matter of testing how
the properties of the system were affected by the different charge
models. Free energy was chosen as a method to measure this, as the
computations of the free energies of binding between two molecules
are highly dependent on the nonbonded parts of the force field equation,
that is, the Coulombic and van der Waals terms. In order to evaluate
the effect of the differing charges from the different models, two
approaches have been used: the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
(generalized born) surface area [MMPB(GB)SA] approach28,29 and the multistate Bennett’s acceptance ratio (MBAR).30 MMPBSA is a widely used approach which is fast
and has been shown to produce trends in binding affinities that are
consistent with experimentally observed trends;31 in contrast, MBAR is much more accurate, but is also much
more computationally expensive.

The system we have chosen to
use as a test case is oligopeptide
permease A (OppA; Figure 2).32 This protein transports oligopeptides
into the cells, and the crystal structures of this protein in complex
with tripeptides of the sequence KXK, where X is any of the 20 natural
amino acids, were available. This makes it an ideal test case, as it allows us to have bound structures of proteins and peptides
where the amino acid is at the interface and is therefore presumed
to be important for the interaction. For each of the six selected
amino acids, the relevant OppA complex was obtained from the pdb repository
(PDB reference codes: KIK, 1b3g.pdb; KKK, 2olb.pdb; KEK, 1jeu.pdb; KFK, 1b40.pdb, KQK, 1b5j.pdb; KYK, 1b58.pdb).

Figure 2 OppA (green) with KIK bound in the pocket (purple).

In each complex, the crystallographic
waters were retained, and
then the whole system was solvated with an octahedral box which was
truncated to ensure that no part of the system was less than 8 Å
from the edge of the box; the system was neutralized with Cl– or Na+ ions where necessary. The parameter file was modified
to change the charge of the residue X to the values calculated in
this study; all other amino acids were assigned the original FF14SB
charges. The resulting system was minimized for 1500 steps of steepest
descent followed by a further 3500 steps of conjugate gradient. Equilibration
consisted of heating from 0 to 300 K in the NVT ensemble for 2.5 ns
followed by a further 20 ns at 300 K in the NPT ensemble. Production
simulations were carried out for 100 ns in the NPT ensemble at 300
K and 1 atm pressure, using the Langevin thermostat and Berendsen
barostat, respectively. Periodic boundary conditions were employed
using an 8 Å radius; inside the radius, the nonbonded terms were
calculated explicitly, while the particle mesh Ewald method was used
outside that radius. The interaction energy between the tripeptide
and the receptor was then measured using MMPBSA with all the differing
charge models, using the PB4 method.33 This
was done to remove any intrinsic variation of the binding energy due
to simulation variability.

We are aware that the interaction
in this system is mediated by
water, and although water at the interface between the ligand and
protein can be of fundamental importance when calculating the binding
free energy within this system,34,35 in this case, our focus
is on only the difference between the binding free energies due to
the differing charge models and hence not on the absolute values.
The presence of interfacial waters is less important in this situation
as we are not attempting to replicate the experimental values or obtain
water-mediated dynamics; any error that derives from neglecting water
molecules will be consistent across different systems.

Another
venue of analysis was the calculation of the solvation
energies, which are dependent on the nonbonded terms (as well as on
the conformation of the molecule). A highly accurate free energy perturbation
approach for the calculation of the free energy of binding differences
is MBAR. These calculations were carried out using 19 lambda windows
from 0.05 to 0.95, extrapolating to the end points. Production simulations
were 1 ns in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm and 300 K using the Berendsen
barostat and the Langevin thermostat, respectively. The system setup
was the same as that used above for MMGBSA calculations.

Finally,
some structural features that depend on charges were also
analyzed and compared across different derivation methods.

Results
and Discussion
Comparison of Charges from the Different
Charge Models
Each charge derivation method generates, at
the atomic positions,
point charges that recreate the QM (or semiempirical) electrostatic
potential. The charges for the six different amino acids are shown
in the supplemental information for the different methods used.

The largest difference in single point charges between the methods
is in the sidechain carbons, most notably at CB, which consistently
has the largest standard deviation between the methods. The maximum
difference in partial charge on any single atom type between the methods
was 0.51. Charges can also differ in sign; an example is the β-hydrogen
of isoleucine, whose charge ranges from −0.0817 to 0.0696.
In general, there is a relatively small difference between the partial
charges obtained from the different approaches used here; an example
is shown in Table 1 for isoleucine. More details on the actual values from each method
for each amino acid are shown in the Supporting Information.

methods that can restrain charges, therefore excluding AM1-BCC methods.
The other atoms include AM1-BCC charges.

Structural Comparisons
Salt Bridge Analysis
In addition
to energetic differences,
we have also looked at two structural features dependent on charges.
The first is a salt bridge interaction that is present in the OppA–KEK
system, where the central glutamate of the peptide interacts with
Arg404. As this is an interaction that is directly dependent on the
charges of the positively and negatively charged residues, it is reasonable
to suggest that it might be susceptible to variations in atomic partial
charges due to different methods of charge derivation. We therefore
compared the distance between the carboxylic and guanidinium groups
of these two residues to see if there are any significant differences
in the salt bridge. It is to be noted that in this interaction the
charges of the arginine residue do not change between different systems,
as they remain those of the FF14SB literature values; it is the glutamate
charges that change. The salt bridge is shown in Figure 3, while the averages are summarized
in Table 2.

of the interaction between the glutamate in the KEK
peptide and arginine 404.

a The comparison includes the standard
deviation for all measurements within the method, and the standard
deviation across all methods. All values are in angstrom.

The distance between the center
of mass of the carboxylic oxygens
of the glutamate and the center of mass of the nitrogen atoms of the
guanidine of the arginine over the simulation for each charge model
is shown in Figure 4. The data follows a Boltzmann distribution, with an average value
between 2.86 (for FF14SB) and 2.96 Å (for RESP, multiconformational,
HF). As it can be seen in the table, the standard deviation between
the charge methods is an order of magnitude smaller than that from
each ensemble, showing no noticeable discrepancies between the different
simulations.

Figure 4 A plot of the distance of the carboxylic acid and the
guanidinium
group across all frames of all runs within a method. The distribution
of distances follows a predictable pattern and clusters around a common
value, indicating that the different charge derivation methods do
not have a large effect on this property.

This shows that there is very little difference in the salt
bridge
in terms of its length or interaction due to differences in the charges.

Root Mean Square Fluctuation Analysis
Another type
of structural analysis that we have carried was the measurement of
the mobility of the residues as measured using the root mean square
fluctuation (RMSF) as a metric. RMSF values were averaged over the
set of three simulations. Because the ligand is buried, conventional
MD was considered sufficient for sampling of the ligand bound in the
cavity. The data is shown in Table 3. The RMSF values are small and without significant
variations across the different charge derivation methods.

With these analyses, we believe we have shown that
structural features
that are likely to be dependent on charges appear to be agnostic to
different charge derivation methods. Regardless of which variables
are used, all produce values that are similar to those reported in
the literature. Our next step in the investigation was to study what
may be of more interest in a comparison with the experiment: free
energies of binding, which are related to the interaction energy between
the protein and the ligand. When employing non-natural amino acids,
it is often done with the aim of producing a better binder, and thus
it is crucial to ensure that new parameters do not skew the free energy
calculations.

Free Energy Calculations
MMPBSA Results
The MD simulations carried out using
the original and derived charges were processed to compute the free
energies of interactions between tripeptides carrying each of the
six amino acids chosen using MMPBSA calculations. Entropy was not
considered when using MMPBSA, as it is notoriously complex and resource-intensive
to address.36 The ΔΔG value describes the difference between each derivation
method and that data obtained by using the original FF14SB values.
The closer that ΔΔG is to zero, the more
it can be assumed that small differences in charge have a minimal
impact on the overall free energy. When calculating the averages of
the ΔΔG values to obtain a mean for a
particular residue or across a particular residue, it was carried
out on the absolute values, ignoring the sign. By and large, the results
in Table 4 seem to
suggest that there is little difference in using one method over another
for charge derivation, and all methods reproduce values similar to
those obtained using literature charges. The ΔΔG ranges from 0.25 to approximately 1 kcal mol–1 in terms of the absolute average, which is well within the error
obtained for a typical MMPBSA or MMGBSA calculation.29 Although this difference is theoretically not negligible
(as 2 kcal mol–1 would imply a difference of about
one order of magnitude in terms of Kd), it is too small to
conclusively attribute it to the differences in charge derivation,
and likely arises due to the inherent imprecision of MMPBSA.37 Thus, we conclude that as long as MMPBSA is
used as the tool for the analysis of free energy changes, all the
examined charge derivation methods should give results that are comparable
with each other and similar to the literature values.

Another level of analysis we
have done is comparing MMPBSA results
between different residues, as MMPBSA is often used to obtain trends
between ligands. To examine the effect of the charge model for this
purpose, we have calculated the ΔΔG between
the peptide with isoleucine and the other ligands in turn. From Figure 5, we observe that
there is very little difference between the charge models, all yielding
the same trends for the ligands. The greatest deviation is between
isoleucine and glutamic acid, with a standard deviation of 1.2 kcal
mol–1. All other ΔΔG’s have a standard deviation less than 0.65 kcal mol–1 between the different charge models (full values in the Supporting Information), which is comparable
to thermal fluctuations; the overall trend clearly remains unchanged.

different residues, showing the difference between the isoleucine
value and that of different amino acids.

Additionally, we have investigated the sidechain contribution
to
the MMPBSA binding energy, specifically the electrostatic component,
which depends the most on charges. The other components (polar solvation
and van der Waals) are not shown here. The results are shown below
in Table 5.

The size of the error bars and the lack of obvious overarching
trends complicated the task of interpreting the data, but some conclusions
could be drawn from the analysis. One observation that can be made
is that the values obtained with AM1-BCC calculations are those that
mirror the FF14SB ones most closely, although only for the polar residues:
for glutamine and glutamic acid, the electrostatic contribution of
those methods is very similar to the one obtained using literature
charges. To a lesser extent, this is also true of lysine and tyrosine,
whereas this is not really the case for isoleucine and phenylalanine.
It can perhaps mean that AM1-BCC most closely replicates the charge
distribution of more strongly charged residues. However, it should
be noticed that the correlation between the electrostatic contribution
to the binding energy and the binding energy itself is mediocre at
best. The highest R2 value is for isoleucine
(0.77), but it is much lower for the other amino acids: it goes from
poor (glutamic acid, 0.34 and lysine, 0.26) to very poor (tyrosine,
0.11; phenylalanine, 0.02; and glutamine, 0.01). In other words, the
electrostatic component is not necessarily predictive of the overall
binding energy, and there are other factors that affect the free energy.
Furthermore, the free energy results, as it can be seen above in Table 4, are very consistent
across different charge models.

A further level of analysis
that we have performed is correlating
the obtained MMPBSA results with the sum of the absolute charge values
for each derivation method. For each method and each amino acid, the
absolute value of the charge was summed to obtain an overall value,
which was averaged across each method and across each residue. The
obtained number can be a property of the charge derivation method;
even if the overall sum of the charges is 0, as it is the case for
neutral amino acids, the sum of absolute values is a measure of the
magnitude of individual charges. The average values for each amino
acid across different methods yield unsurprising results: isoleucine
and phenylalanine, which contain no heteroatoms in the sidechain,
have lower sums than other residues, which have greater sums in proportion
to the number of oxygens and nitrogens they include. The standard
deviation is also fairly narrow, indicating that the results are consistent
for each residue. This data is shown in Table 6.

This sort of analysis can reveal important information
regarding
the trends and correlations within different methods. For example,
when averaging only the values of those methods that involve HF and
averaging only those that use B3LYP, the former are generally of larger
magnitude and have smaller standard deviations, as shown in Table 7. This is due to the
well-known overpolarization of HF.38

It is however more interesting to consider the average
for one
charge derivation method across different residues and comparing that
to the binding affinity data to obtain correlation values, which is
shown in Tables 8aa
and 8bb. Although it may seem strange to consider
together charged, polar, and nonpolar residues alike, focusing on
each method across different amino acids can reveal if there are trends
in how the charges affect the interaction of the peptide. The average
values across the method were correlated with the ΔG MMPBSA results obtained by using different charges on the FF14SB
runs. As shown by the R2, the correlation
goes from poor (glutamine and phenylalanine) to very poor (tyrosine
and lysine). We believe that this supports our observation that there
is very little difference between charge derivation methods: even
in the case of glutamine, the change in the sum of charges given by
the differences in charge derivation methods correlates poorly with
the obtained values, and all other residues have even weaker correlations.
Thus, although they may yield charges of different magnitude and of
different distributions, all charge derivation methods end up giving
similar results when analyzed with MMPBSA. Even when considering known
differences within methods, this does not translate to significantly
different MMPBSA results.

MBAR Results
The other free energy
approach we used
to evaluate the effect of charges was MBAR. We calculated the hydration
energy of the Ace-X-Nme system. Table 9 presents the average of the absolute ΔΔG values from MBAR. The average ΔΔG for the MBAR results across all the residues and charge models is
0.28 kcal mol–1 with a standard deviation of 0.18
kcal mol–1. Tyrosine has the largest differences,
with a max ΔΔG of 1.06 kcal mol–1 (RESP, average of B3LYP conformations) and an average of 0.63 kcal
mol–1. The next highest difference is for phenylalanine
with a max ΔΔG of 0.81 kcal mol–1 (AM1-BCC, single conformation αR) and an average
of 0.28 kcal mol–1, which is much lower than that
for tyrosine. Charged residues, and those containing a phenyl ring,
have larger average differences and standard deviations. Of the various
methods examined, no single approach produced the smallest differences
across the amino acids. Overall, the average differences between the
different methods are quite comparable, however, AM1-BCC single conformation
C5 and RESP multiconformational HF from the Red Server
performed the best, and the averaged B3LYP approach performed the
worst. The experimental uncertainty for binding free energies is approximately
0.6 kcal mol–1,39 setting
the upper limit for in silico approaches. Differences in predicted
binding free energy results within this range could therefore be considered
indistinguishable. On the basis of this conclusion, all charge methods
produce fairly comparable results, although some appear to be better.

Conclusions
Given the evidence that we have presented above, we can conclude
that any of the approaches that we have used to derive charges can
reproduce, within error, the values that are observed when using the
FF14SB charges. In other words, if we were to use these methods to
obtain charges for an unknown, non-natural amino acid, we would do
so with the confidence that our results would be comparable and compatible
with parameters of existing residues.

That is not to say that
there are not any differences between the
methods. For example, from the analysis of the electrostatic contribution
to the binding energy, the AM1-BCC methods seem to replicate the values
obtained with FF14SB the most closely for polar residues. From the
MBAR data, the methods that use HF instead of B3LYP have greater agreement
with FF14SB results and therefore appear to be superior for charge
derivation.

However, all methods generally produce results that
are within
error. This is because the general approach, which includes steps
such as restraining the backbone and maintain equivalence between
chemically identical atoms, is robust enough to account for minor
variations due to differing initial structures, or differing basis
sets and quantum methods. The resulting charges may vary, and this
may have an impact on the simulation, but such small differences are
eclipsed by other interactions which do not depend on charges, by
the inherent variability of MD runs, and by the intrinsic inaccuracy
of the methods commonly used to analyze the simulations. It is our
opinion that an accurate assigning of the atom types that determine
the internal parameters is far more important than the minute differences
in charge, as the former control bonds, angles, torsions, and van
der Waals interactions which will have a larger effect on the overall
simulation.

It should be noted however that we have only tested
relatively
easy systems that involved natural amino acids, which are well-known
and lack problematic features. The largely aliphatic and well-documented
nature of the residues did not include functional groups which may
have been described by our approaches in a less robust manner. Future
efforts should focus on determining what is the best approach to parametrize
systems involving highly polarizable or highly charged species,40 metals,41 or halides,42 which may all present unique challenges.

In conclusion, the current study provides compelling evidence that
for the investigated class of chemical species, all examined charge
derivation approaches produce equivalent results.
