Currently, hunting for anti-temperature-degradation
high-efficiency
phosphors has become crucially significant for fabricating high-brightness
phosphor-converted white light-emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs). Herein,
we show that photoluminescence in a kind of full-solution-processed
K2SiF6:Mn4+ red phosphor exhibits
an extraordinarily large negative thermal quenching property. For
instance, under the excitation of 477 nm laser light, the sample photoluminescence
intensity amazingly increases by 347-fold when the temperature is
increased from 4 to 477 K. The temperature-driven transition probability
enhancement of the phonon-induced luminescence around Mn4+ ions in the phosphor is argued to be responsible for the large negative-thermal-quenching
phenomenon. We also demonstrate a pc-WLED with Ra of 82 and correlated color temperature of 2701 K by using
the K2SiF6:Mn4+ red phosphor + commercial
yellow phosphor of YAG:Ce3+.

Introduction
Solid-state light-emitting diode (LED)
lighting technology triggered
by the discovery of efficient blue LEDs offers the most promising
change in lighting technology since Edison created the first commercialized
electrical lightbulb over 130 years ago.1,2 In sharp contrast
to the electrical “hot” lightbulbs, emerging LED lightbulbs
belong to so-called “cold” light sources. Great energy
saving and environmental friendship are the most favored advantages
of LED-based cold lightbulbs.3 Among the
already-demonstrated white light LED bulbs, InGaN blue LED chip +
high-efficiency luminescent phosphor forms a mainstream module, and
has been even specially termed as phosphor-converted white LED (pc-WLED).4 In such a module, phosphors play a crucial role
in determining the performance and quality of pc-WLED. In turn, the
development of pc-WLED lightbulbs puts forward greater demands on
phosphors for luminescence quantum efficiency and simultaneous thermal
stability. Unfortunately, almost all the existing solid luminescent
materials suffer from severe degradation in emission intensity and
even thermal quenching with the rise of temperature.5−11 Such thermal deterioration of emission intensity is mainly ascribed
to the rapid increase of nonradiative multiphonon transition probability
with temperature. Presently, hunting for high-efficiency and anti-temperature-degradation
phosphors has become a key challenge for fabricating high-brightness
pc-WLED lightbulbs.12,13 Very recently, Kim and his co-workers
reported a zero-thermal-quenching blue phosphor of Na3–2xSc2(PO4)3:xEu2+ phosphor that does not exhibit thermal
quenching even up to 200 °C.13 The
zero-thermal-quenching phenomenon is explained by them as polymorphic
modification and possible energy transfer from electron–hole
pairs at the thermally activated defect levels to the Eu2+ 5d-band with increasing temperature. This important finding also
inspires the exploration of converting phosphors with a zero-thermal-quenching
and even a negative-thermal-quenching property for high-power LED
applications.

In recent years, Mn4+-activated inorganic
phosphors
have quickly emerged as a new class of promising phosphors for fabricating
pc-WLED because of their high-efficiency narrow red-light emissions.14−23 Among them is cubic K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor, which can be synthesized at −16 °C with a
full-solution chemical route,22 showing
an outstanding property of phonon-induced dominant luminescence at
room temperature.25 In the present study,
we report an observation and argument on large negative-thermal-quenching
phenomenon in the cubic K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor for temperature variation from 4 to 477 K, when it was
under the excitation of 477 nm nonintensive laser light. Such an amazing
property makes the phosphor be disruptively different from the most
luminescence solids whose luminescence intensities usually weaken
with the rise of temperature and be appealing as a kind of thermal
energy (phonons) converting phosphor for luminescence at high temperatures.
Together with the commercial yellow phosphor of YAG:Ce3+, this kind of narrow red phosphor is utilized to convert a 450 nm
InGaN blue chip into a warm white LED with good performance.

Results
and Discussion
As mentioned earlier, cubic K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor was synthesized at −16 °C
with a full-solution
approach. The detailed synthesis procedure has been described elsewhere.22 For crystalline structure characterization on
the synthesized phosphor, precise X-ray diffraction patterns and analysis
can also be referred to in ref (24). Here, we present high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) characterization on the local microstructures of
the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor, as shown
in Figure 1a. By selecting
an area of about 160 × 160 nm2 as the diffraction
region, we completed an electron diffraction experiment. The inset
shows the electron diffraction patterns composed of spotted circles,
indicating the crystalline nature of the phosphor. In order to obtain
a closer inspection on the lattice structures of the crystalline phosphor,
three regions [e.g., (I), (II), and (III)] in Figure 1a were enlarged and re-illustrated in (b),
(c), and (d), respectively. Their corresponding fast Fourier transformation
(FFT) patterns are depicted at the bottom corners of the respective
figures. Several lattice plane spacings and lattice structural angles
were determined, as shown in Figure 1b–d. In spite of the limited resolution, the
cubic lattice structure of the phosphor can be certainly verified
in the local enlarged HRTEM image, as marked in Figure 1c.

patterns. (b–d) enlarged HRTEM regions (I–III) in (a),
respectively, and their corresponding FFT patterns.

Figure 2a shows
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor measured at different temperatures. A remarkable
increase of the red emission intensity with temperature may be more
straightforwardly seen in photographs in Figure 2b. For the temperature increase from 4 to
477 K, the color of photographs changes from bright blue largely because
of the Rayleigh scattering of the 477 nm excitation light by the powder
sample to dazzling red because of amazing enhancement of the red emission
of the sample. As seen from the PL spectra, instead of the magnetic-dipole
transition-induced zero-phonon line (ZPL),25 the luminescence (phonon sidebands) around the Mn4+ ion
by the electric-dipole transitions is always dominant in the PL spectra
of the phosphor. It has been identified that the vibronic states arising
from the coupling of 2Eg excited state of Mn4+ ions with the three triplet odd-parity vibration modes (ν3, ν4, and ν6) of the host
lattice are responsible for the three main emission bands including
both Stokes and anti-Stokes bands.22,24,26 Disappearance of the ZPL line reflects both the spin-
and parity-forbidden nature of the electronic transitions between 2Eg and 4A2g electronic states
of Mn4+ ions in a cubic K2SiF6 lattice.
It is known that in a perfect K2SiF6 single
crystal with cubic structure, a Si4+ ion is tightly coordinated
with six nearest F– ions, constituting a perfect
octahedral structure with local inversion symmetry of point group Oh.26,27 When Mn atoms are intentionally incorporated into this host matrix
to replace Si, a new octahedral structure of [MnF6]2– with some lattice distortion but remaining the inversion
symmetry forms.26−29 The new octahedral structure of [MnF6]2– may belong to a point group of D4h.29−32 In the host crystal, [MnF6]2– can act
as an efficient luminescence center.12,20,21 Probably, an outstanding property of this luminescence
center is that its emission intensity rises so strongly with increasing
the temperature, as seen in Figure 3a where the overall integrated PL intensity (solid
circles + dashed line) versus temperature is illustrated. For example,
the total emission intensity amazingly rises by ∼347-fold when
the temperature is increased from 4 to 477 K. The blue solid line
represents a theoretical fitting curve with eq 1, which is an analytical expression approximately
based on relevant theoretical models26,33−36 1  where C is a constant, ΔE an energy separation with respect to the ZPL, ℏωv an average characteristic energy of involved phonons, and kB the Boltzmann constant. In fact, 1/[exp(ℏωv/kBT) –
1]in eq 1 represents
the Bose–Einstein distribution of the involved phonons.

Figure 2 (a) PL spectra
of the phosphor measured at different temperatures
under the excitation of 477 nm laser light; (b) PL photographs of
the sample at various temperatures.

Figure 3 (a) Total PL integrated intensities (solid circles + solid line)
vs temperature; (b) PL QYs of the sample measured at room temperature.

In order to understand the remarkable
enhancement of the PL intensity
in the interested temperature range, we measured the PL excitation
(PLE) spectra of the sample at different temperatures, as shown in Figure 4. It is obvious that
the PLE intensity at 477 nm increases substantially with increasing
the temperature. The consistent enhancement in both PL and PLE signals
unambiguously indicates the occurrence of a negative-thermal-quenching
effect in the studied K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor. The major mechanism of the negative-thermal-quenching
effect in the studied K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor with cubic structure shall be the nature of phonon-induced
radiative transitions at Mn4+ ions which strictly occupy
the inversion center with surrounding six nearest F– ions, as shown in Figure 5a. Such central inversion symmetry directly leads to a forbidden
pure 2Eg → 4A2g transition of Mn4+ ions according to the Laporte rule.
This rule states that the d–d electronic transitions in atoms
in a centrosymmetric environment are electric-dipole-forbidden, which
applies to octahedral coordination compounds of the transition metals.37 A zero or extremely weak ZPL line is indeed
observed in the experiment. On the contrary, the phonon-assisted 2Eg → 4A2g transitions
(vibronic transitions) may become dominant. In such vibronic transitions,
some phonons with particular symmetries (i.e., modes) play an essential
role. On the basis of available theoretical studies,26,33−36 we derived an approximated expression for the transition probability
of vibronic transitions, as formulated by eq 1. This expression tells us that the transition
probability depends distinctively on temperature, that is, roughly
exponentially grows with temperature and hence thermal energy (e.g., kBT). As shown in Figure 3a, remarkable enhancement is
indeed observed for the total PL intensity of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor as the temperature increases. Moreover,
good agreement between theory and experiment is achieved. In fact,
temperature-induced enhancement of vibronic transitions has been repeatedly
observed in the luminescence of analogous Cr3+ ions in
garnet crystal,38 phosphor39 and transparent ceramics.25

Figure 4 PLE spectra
measured in the spectral range of 467–496 nm
at various temperatures. Clearly, the PLE intensity at 477 nm increases
significantly with the rise of temperature.

transitions around Mn4+ ions in a K2SiF6 host crystal. (c) Three dominant phonon modes engaged in
the electron–phonon coupling and vibronic transitions. (d)
EPR spectra of K2SiF6:Mn4+ measured

We randomly selected eight K2SiF6:Mn4+ specimens and measured
their PL quantum yields (QYs) at room temperature. The results are
illustrated in Figure 3b. It can be seen that all eight specimens have QY values above 80%,
and the best one even higher than 97%.

As argued earlier and
schematically illustrated in Figure 5a, a central Mn4+ ion tightly binds with
six nearest F– ions to
form an octahedral luminescence center [MnF6]2– in the cubic K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor.
Under the excitation of an appropriate light, for example, 477 nm
blue laser, such a luminescence center can become excited via absorbing
the incident photons and then emit red light by releasing the absorbed
energy. For the absorptive and emissive optical transitions between
the vibronic states, a widely adopted picture, namely configurational
coordinate model, is usually used to discuss them,40,41 as schematically shown in Figure 5b. In the figure, the dashed vertical line represents
a pure electronic transition which may produce the so-called ZPL line.
In the studied case, such a “pure” electronic transition
is a forbidden transition process because of both spin and parity
transition rules. The bold red arrow denotes the Stokes radiative
transition process accompanying the phonon emission, whereas the solid
blue arrow stands for the anti-Stokes radiative transition in which
phonon absorption is involved. For the [MnF6]2– octahedral configuration, there are totally six main vibration modes,
among which only three engage in the vibronic transitions. Figure 5c schematically illustrates
the three vibration modes, that is, ν3, ν4, and ν6. From the measured PL spectra, characteristic
energies of phonons ν6, ν4, and
ν3 may be determined to be about 28.5, 41.4, and
78.7 meV, respectively. For the electronic part of the vibronic states,
3d3 electrons of Mn4+ ions play a key role.
To get more useful information on 3d3 electrons of Mn4+ ions in the studied phosphor, electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) measurements were carried out at various temperatures under
a fixed microwave frequency of 9.414 × 109 Hz. The
experimental EPR data are illustrated in Figure 5d. From the figure, it can be seen that six
main EPR signatures can be well detected, having g factors of 1.8–2.2. These six fine EPR structures exactly
reflect the hyperfine interaction of 3d3 electrons of the
Mn ion with the surrounding magnetic nucleus.42 From the measured EPR data, that is, the spacing of two adjacent
EPR structures, we may determine the hyperfine coupling constant.
The obtained value of ∼80 Gauss is somewhat smaller than that
of the CaAl12O9:Mn4+ (∼100
Gauss) phosphor probably because of the difference in local environment
between the two different compounds.43 Interestingly,
the EPR signal intensity is observed to decline gradually with the
rise of temperature. It is known that the EPR signal is proportional
to the population difference between spin states of the defect.43 The EPR signal decline with temperature may
be mainly attributed to the decrease of population difference between
the Zeeman states of Mn4+ ions because of the thermal distribution
at higher spin states.

In the remainder of this paper, we examine
the device performance
of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor in pc-WLEDs.
Room-temperature luminescence spectra of the phosphor alone and the
two pc-WLEDs were measured, as shown in Figure 6. For the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor powder, the International Commission on Illumination
(CIE) chromaticity coordinates of the luminescence spectrum are calculated
to be 0.6927 and 0.3072, located at the edge of the red region and
marked by an open circle, as shown in Figure 6b. These results suggest that the red phosphors
synthesized in this study are very suitable for the use of high-quality
back-light display with wide color gamut. By combining it with a blue
InGaN LED chip (luminescence peaking at 450 nm), a pink-light LED
device can be formed, as shown in the inset figure of Figure 6c. The luminescence spectrum
of this pc-WLED has coordinate positions at 0.4750 and 0.1977, and
a relatively low correlated color temperature (CCT) of 1050 K. With
further addition of commercial YAG:Ce3+ yellow phosphor,
the measured luminescence spectrum of the new pc-WLED shows full-color
emission behavior in the entire visible region, as seen in Figure 6e. The inset figure
shows a photograph of the as-fabricated pc-WLED device. Chromaticity
coordinates (0.4710, 0.4307) of the device are marked by an open circle
in CIE color spaces in Figure 6f. Compared with the commercial pc-WLED with low color render
index [color rendering index (CRI) or Ra < 70] and high CCT (>5000) only using YAG:Ce3+ yellow
phosphor, we demonstrate a warm-white LED with excellent parameters,
that is, Ra of 82 and CCT of 2701 K by
adding the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor as
the red component phosphor. The obtained luminous efficiency of this
pc-WLED is 124 lm/W under 60 mA driving current. The National Television
System Committee (NTSC) value of the pc-WLED made of K2SiF6:Mn4+ + YAG:Ce3+ was measured
to be about 45.34%. It is obvious that both the luminous efficiency
and NTSC value of the demonstrated pc-WLED are not comparable to those
of the latest commercial products.44 Further
process optimization in the fabrication of pc-WLED shall help improve
the performance of the devices. It is of interest to note other demonstrated
WLEDs, especially ones made of III-nitride nanowires on Si45,46 and even on the Cu substrate.47 For instance,
Guo et al. demonstrated an InGaN/GaN disk-in-nanowire WLED with chromaticity
coordinates of x = 0.29 and y =
0.37 and a CCT of 5500–6500 K at an injection current of 50
A/cm2,45 whereas Philip et al.
reported an InGaN/AlGaN nanowire WLED with a high CRI of ∼98.46 More recently and interestingly, Philip et al.
fabricated high-brightness phosphor-free III-nitride nanowire LEDs
on Cu with highly stable white-light emission and high CRI of ∼95.47 These studies may open another technical approach
for fabricating phosphor-free WLEDs with high performance and some
advantages such as more efficient thermal management and enhanced
light-extraction efficiency.

Conclusions
In summary, the K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor
synthesized at low temperature with a full-solution route is examined
with emphasis on its variable-temperature PL property. The phosphor
possesses good cubic crystalline structure evidenced by precise HRTEM
images and the corresponding FFT patterns. More intriguingly, it exhibits
an extraordinary thermally driven enhancement of emission intensity
in a wide temperature range from 4 to 477 K under the excitation of
a 477 nm weak laser. A significant increase of transition probability
of the dominant vibronic transitions around Mn4+ ions with
temperature is argued to be responsible for the observed negative
thermal quenching. By combining this kind of phosphor with commercial
YAG:Ce3+ yellow phosphor and 450 nm blue InGaN LED chip,
we demonstrate a pc-WLED with good luminous properties.

Experimental
Details
Synthesis of the K2SiF6:Mn4+ Phosphor
The K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphor was synthesized at a low temperature of −16 °C
with a two-step wet-chemical method. In the first step, the K2MnF6 powder was prepared. For the preparation of
the K2MnF6 powder, the KHF2 powder
was dissolved in HF solution first and then via strong stirring operation
to form a uniform solution. By adding some amount of KMnO4 powder into the solution, one obtained a black mixture solution.
Followed by the addition of H2O2 solution, a
brown-yellow solution was achieved with some precipitant generated.
After three times of vacuum filtration and washing process, a drying
process was carried out at 80 °C for one night before the brown
K2MnF6 powder was obtained. In the second step,
the obtained K2MnF6 powder was dissolved in
the HF solution and gradually formed as a uniform golden-yellow solution
during a vigorous stirring process. After the addition of KHF2 powder, a continuous stirring operation was carried out until
a uniform solution was achieved. H2SiF6 solution
was then added dropwise into the above solution, and a golden-yellow
precipitant was generated in the solution. Following three times of
vacuum filtration and washing process, a drying operation was carried
out at 80 °C for one night, and a final target product was prepared.

HRTEM Characterization
Precise structural characterization
of the sample was carried out with HRTEM using a Jeol JEM-ARM300F
TEM microscope. The microscope was operated at 300 kV with aberration
correction for HRTEM imaging. As the specimen consisting of fluorine
was sensitive to high-energy electron beam bombardment, HRTEM image-taking
was done at a low electron dose <30 e/Å2·s.
Images were acquired with Gatan OneView camera running at 25 (fps).
Under such conditions, 25 frames were aligned using cross correlation
and integrated within 1 s to obtain a final image with the size of
4k × 4k.

High-Resolution PL Spectral Measurements
High-resolution
PL spectra were recorded on a home-assembled PL setup using the 477
nm line of an Ar–Kr ion mixed gas laser (Coherent Innova-70)
as the excitation source. In the variable-temperature PL measurements,
the phosphor powder was mounted with silver paint on the cold finger
of a closed cycle cryostat, providing a varying temperature range
of 4–300 K. For the PL measurements at temperatures higher
than 300 K, the phosphor sample was directly heated by a heater in
the atmospheric environment. The luminescence signal of the sample
was dispersed by a monochromator with focal length of 0.75 m (Spex
750M) and detected with a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R928). A
lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research SR830) together with a standard
optical chopper was employed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.
Finally, a data-acquire module was used to convert the detector electrical
signal into digital data that can be accepted by a computer. The control
and data-taking software was encoded by us with LabVIEW.

Testing Equipment
and Method of Quantum Yields
PL QYs
of the phosphors were measured on an Edinburgh FLS920-s fluorescence
spectrometer + integrating sphere system at room temperature.

EPR Spectral
Characterization
EPR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker-Biospin (E500) spectrometer with the spectral resolution
of 1 kHz. Sample temperature was controlled by using a liquid nitrogen
variable-temperature control system. EPR spectra were measured via
applying a microwave radiation of 9.41 × 109 Hz and
scanning an external magnetic field.

LED-Device Performance
Characterization
Pc-WLED devices
were prepared with a 450 nm InGaN blue chip + a coating layer of the
mixed phosphor of red K2SiF6:Mn4+ and yellow YAG:Ce3+ powders. Two kinds of phosphors were
completely mixed with each other in silicone, and the obtained mixture
was then coated on the surface of the LED chips for producing pc-WLEDs.
Device performance was evaluated by using an Edinburgh FLS920-s fluorescence
spectrometer + integrating sphere system. The prepared pc-WLEDs were
operated under a driving current of 60 mA at room temperature. Spectral
intensity distribution of the devices was used to calculate their
CCT and CRI. Luminous efficiency was determined by calculating the
ratio of the measured luminous flux output and the input electrical
power of the pc-WLEDs.
