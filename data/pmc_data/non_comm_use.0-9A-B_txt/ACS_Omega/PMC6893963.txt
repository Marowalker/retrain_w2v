Platinum plays a crucial role in the field of basic electrochemistry,
regeneration energy, and so on. Pt nanomaterials with well-controlled
size and shape could be easily obtained from metal–oleate complexes.
However, these nanoparticles (NPs) were electrochemically inactive
because of the attached organic residue. This work has been reported
as a robust method to remove the residues from the surface of Pt nanoparticle
catalysts by the electrochemical treatment in alkaline media. After
the electrochemical activation, the Pt nanoparticle catalysts show
good catalytic behavior toward the electrochemical oxidation of methanol
and formic acid.

1 Introduction
For several decades, low-temperature
fuel cells have attracted
great interest from scientists and engineers in the field of alternative
energy because of their simple system and high energy density.1 The ease of transport and stability at ambient
conditions of fuel are additional advantages of low-temperature fuel
cells. In the fuel cells, catalysts that are made of metal nanoparticles
(NPs) and supporting materials for the electrochemical reaction are
key components.2 Among various metal nanoparticles,
Pt nanoparticles (NPs) have been the most extensively used materials
in fuel oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction.3 PtNPs catalyst could be synthesized by various methods,
such as impregnation, microemulsion, and electrodeposition in aqueous
solutions with or without a surfactant.4−6 The synthesis of PtNPs
in aqueous solutions was routinely used. However, it is relatively
difficult to precisely control the size and shape of the NPs when
compared with the organic solvent-based synthetic methods.7,8

Through organic solvent-based synthetic methods, highly uniform
nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanocubes could be synthesized from
metal cationic precursors in the presence of oleate or stearate as
a surfactant.9−11 There are already many reports on the synthesis of
noble metal nanoparticles, such as Ag, Au, Pt, and Pt alloy nanomaterials,
with well-controlled size and shape using metal–oleate complex.12−15 Pt and Pt alloy nanoparticles prepared from the Pt–oleate
complex had very uniform size distribution, however, these NPs were
electrochemically inactive because of the fouling of the attached
organic residues.16,17 Several groups have made attempts
to address this problem. Sun et al. have reported that grafted organics
on the NPs were successfully removed by several hours of washing with
acetic acid solution at 70 °C.18 Feliu
and Zou groups reported that Pt nanoparticles and nanocubes could
be washed by a mixture of hexane/ethanol.19,20 Heat treatment is also a routinely used method to remove attached
organic molecules on the NPs.21 Somorjai
et al. proposed the UV–ozone treatment method to remove capping
agents using the UV–ozone chamber.22 Lee group introduced the ultrasonication process to remove the capping
agent for 5 h.23 Recently, Solla-Gullón
et al. reviewed the cleaning methodologies on the surface of metal
nanoparticles.24 Although these methods
are effective to remove organic residues, these processes are usually
time-consuming and involve harsh conditions.

Herein, a new way
for the removal of organic impurities on the
surface of metal nanoparticles in the alkaline media is introduced.
We propose a simple electrochemical method in alkaline solution to
effectively remove the organic residues from the surface of Pt nanoparticles
which were synthesized on the carbon substrate using the metal–oleate
complex by simple heat treatment. The electrochemical activity of
the initially synthesized Pt catalysts was severely hampered due to
the organic residues as formed from the degradation of the oleate
chain during the synthesis. After the electrochemical treatment in
alkaline media, the electrocatalytic behavior of these catalysts for
methanol and formic acid oxidation was significantly recovered.

2 Results and Discussion
For preparing
Pt nanoparticles, we introduce the facile heat treatment
method using Pt–oleate complex as the precursor. The Pt–oleate
complex was obtained by simple mixing of Pt acetylacetonate and oleate
solution. Then, the Pt–oleate complex was homogeneously mixed
with carbon black by grinding. The mixture was then heated at 200
°C for 3 h under a N2 atmosphere to form Pt/C catalyst.
The Pt–oleate complex was converted into monodisperse Pt nanoparticles
(PtNPs) on the surface of carbon black upon heating under the inert
atmosphere. Simultaneously, the organic residue grafted the Pt nanoparticles
through the thermal decomposition of oleate.

Figure 1A–C
shows high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and
high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images of 2 nm PtNPs obtained
from the synthesis. These composites were washed several times using
hexane and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven to remove oleate
residues. Each PtNP had a highly crystalline structure with d-spacing of 0.23 nm, which is in agreement with the (111)
lattice parameter of the face-centered cubic structure of Pt. The
crystalline structure of Pt was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of Pt (JCPDS 4-802) (Figure 1D) and the average NP size was calculated
to be 2.3 nm by the Debye–Scherrer equation.

Figure 1 (A, B) TEM and HR-TEM
images, (C) HAADF-STEM images, and (D) XRD
pattern of 40 wt % Pt/KB.

The catalytic activity of the PtNPs toward methanol
and formic
acid oxidation was studied and estimated using an electrochemical
system. The initial cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the catalyst were
obtained before activation treatment and showed weak hydrogen adsorption
and desorption peaks due to grafted organic residue, as shown in Figure 2A. According to Somorjai
et al., it was reported that catalytic activity strongly depends upon
the character of interaction between the metal surface and the organic
molecules. To recover the inherent electrocatalytic activity, the
potential was cyclically scanned from 0.3 to −0.8 V in 0.5
M KOH solution. After the electrochemical conditioning, the hydrogen
adsorption and desorption peak became apparent, which demonstrated
that an organic residue was significantly removed from the surface
of the PtNPs, and they could be applied as electrocatalysts toward
methanol oxidation and formic acid oxidation. Moreover, we observed
the recovery phenomena of electrocatalytic activity during the CV
cycling in a basic solution (Figure 3). The peaks in the range of −0.8 to −0.6
V (hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the alkaline media) and the reduction
peak of Pt oxide at ca. −0.34 V were barely observed during
the first scan, which means that the surfaces of PtNPs were contaminated
by organic residues.25 Interestingly, the
peak intensities of hydrogen adsorption/desorption and the reduction
of Pt oxide were raised in increments with each cycle, and the peaks
reached their diffusion-limited maxima at 15 cycles, at which point
the inactive sites on the surface of the catalysts were converted
to active sites. Hydrogen adsorption/desorption peaks are fully recovered
in the cyclic voltammetry test after 15 cycles, which means that the
recovery reaction terminates after 15 cycles. It is important to confirm
the termination reaction in terms of checking hydrogen adsorption/desorption
peaks instead of counting cyclic numbers. In Figure 4, the morphology of Pt nanoparticles in electrochemical
treatment to remove organic shells is represented. The images show
that there is no effect and change in morphologies before and after
treatment, and the d-spacing of these nanoparticles
before and after treatment were calculated to be 2.267 and 2.258 Å,
respectively. This phenomenon explains that this method makes organic
shell removal not successful to Pt nanoparticles.

We proposed the mechanism of cleaning using the
electrochemical
process in alkaline solution in Figure 5. The key factor for successful deactivation of metal
nanoparticles is electrochemical activation in alkaline solution.
Oleylamine is widely used in solvothermal metal or metal oxide nanoparticle
synthesis owing to its high boiling point and its role as a mild reducing
agent and is a co-surfactant with oleic acid. Even though oleylamine
acts as a co-surfactant with oleic acid, the charge repulsion with
metal precursor occurs in the mixing solution. Oleic acid plays the
main role of surfactant and oleylamine as the stabilized solution
in the surroundings of capped metal nanoparticles and reducing agent.26−28 Organic-capped Pt nanoparticles show that the equilibrium of net
charge between metal NPs and surfactant was stabilized. However, outer
layer organics are detrimental to the electrocatalytic reaction. The
residual organic on PtNPs have to be removed by electrochemical polishing
to activate the PtNP catalyst in the fuel oxidation reaction.29To solve this problem, the charge balance of
organic-grafted Pt nanoparticle has to be broken by the applied negative
potential and Pt metal nanoparticles were decontaminated in KOH, which
means that oleylamine and oleic acid have ethylene double bonds in
the chain. In the saponification reaction, an alkaline gradient, such
as NaOH and KOH, is widely used to remove surfactant and organic residues.30 KOH, serving as a source of OH– as a nucleophile in organic chemistry, attacks adsorption bonding
between metal NPs and the organic residue and the applied potential
accelerates to strip off the organic residue. These organic residues
on the surface of metal are effectively eliminated in the alkaline
condition. Therefore, the cleaning effect of organic-grafted metal
nanoparticles might be effectively accelerated by these phenomena.

mechanism of electrochemical activation of organic-capped
metal nanoparticles.

To further study, we examined the catalytic performance
of the
PtNPs for the electrooxidation of methanol using an electrochemical
analyzer (see the Experimental Section), and
the results are shown in Figure 2B. The commercial Pt/C catalyst in Tanaka was introduced
to compare with the as-synthesized catalyst. After alkaline treatment,
the Pt/C catalyst showed peak potentials of +0.6 and +0.8 V in the
cathodic and anodic scans, respectively, in the presence of 0.5 M
methanol. The oxidation peak of methanol was not observed before treatment,
which could be explained by the fact that the organic residue on the
Pt surface blocked access to the electrocatalytically active sites
before the activation treatment. The electrocatalytic activity was
definitely recovered by electrochemical scanning in an alkaline solution
since the organic residue is removed from the Pt surface. Interestingly,
this treatment only worked in alkaline media (as opposed to acidic
media). We also observed these phenomena during the oxidation of formic
acid (Figure 2C). PtNPs
prepared by the Pt–oleate complex precursor could be applied
to the electrooxidation of both methanol and formic acid. Different
PtNP weight % of Pt/C catalysts were applied as electrocatalysts for
the oxidation of fuel in Figure 6. The electrocatalytic properties of 12 wt % Pt/KB
are analogous to those of 40 wt % Pt/KB. The electrocatalytic activity
of these catalysts was activated and recovered by electrochemical
treatment for methanol and formic acid oxidation as seen in Figure 6. To confirm the
scalability, 12 and 40 wt % Pt/Kb catalysts were calculated in mass
activity. The mass activities of 12 and 40 wt % Pt/KB catalysts are
almost equal, 2.083 and 2.215 mA/g/cm2, respectively.

in the mixture of 0.5 M formic acid and HClO4 of 12 wt
% Pt/KB (scan rate: 100 mV/s).

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated that the
inactive PtNPs prepared by Pt–oleic
acid and oleylamine complex precursor could be recovered and activated
by electrochemical treatment in alkaline solution for the catalytic
oxidation reaction of methanol and formic acid. The key to the successful
recovery and activation of PtNPs was to use cyclic voltammetry in
alkaline solution to easily remove organic residue from the surface
of metal nanoparticles. The electrochemically treated Pt nanoparticles
exhibited excellent catalytic performance for methanol and formic
acid oxidation. This method could provide a general approach for electrochemical
activation in alkaline media of inactive contaminated catalyst by
oleic acid and oleylamine.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Oleylamine (OAm, >70%)
and oleic acid (OA, >70%) were purchased from Samjung company.
Pt(acac)2 and RuCl3 were purchased from Aldrich.
The deionized
(DI) water was used from a Millipore Auto system. All of the reagents
were of analytical grade and used without purification.

4.2 Synthesis and Characterization of Pt–Oleate
Complex
In a typical synthesis, preparation of Pt–oleate
complex, 0.038 g of platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2, 0.1 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) was dispersed in 0.5 mL of oleylamine
and 0.5 mL of oleic acid. And then 0.1 g of Ketjen Black EC-300J (Ketjen
Black International Company) was mixed with the Pt–oleate complex
by simple grinding with a pestle and mortar. The mixture of Pt–oleate
and ketjen black was heated at the heating rate of 5 °C/min under
a nitrogen atmosphere and then kept at 200 °C for 3 h. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and HAADF-STEM images were conducted using
a JEOL EM-2100F microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization
was carried out using Rigaku Dmax 2500 diffractometer.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical measurements of methanol and formic acid oxidation
were conducted with an electrochemical analyzer (Autolab PGSTAT302N)
with a 5 mm diameter glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as the substrate/working
electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. Ag/AgCl (Bioanalytical
Systems, Inc.) and Hg/HgO as reference electrodes were used in acidic
and alkaline conditions, respectively. The working electrode was modified
in the following manner: 10 mg of catalysts (Pt/KB), 500 μL
of isopropyl alcohol (IPA), and 100 μL of Nafion solution (Sigma-Aldrich,
5 wt % Nafion in DI water) were dispersed in 500 μL of DI water.
The slurry ink was ultrasonicated for 20 min. Slurry ink (8 μL)
was dropped onto the GCE and dried using an IR lamp. The test solution
was 0.5 M of HClO4. The catalysts were cycled at a scan
rate of 100 mV/s at room temperature until stable cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) were obtained. The activation process was performed in 0.5 M
of KOH solution while purging with nitrogen and cycled at a scan rate
of 100 mV/s at room temperature. After activation, the treated sample
was measured in solutions of 0.5 M of HClO4 + 0.5 M methanol
and 0.5 M of HClO4 + 0.5 M formic acid.
