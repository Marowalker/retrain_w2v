This work seeks for
a better understanding on how the gas treatment process affected the
structure of metal loaded zeolite Y (MY, M = Ag, Cu) adsorbants and
how the structural changes affected the performances of the adsorbents
for adsorptive desulfurization. A series of characterization tools
including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance were employed. Compared
to the N2 treatment, the H2 treatment on the
MY adsorbents led to the reduction of the loaded M components to their
metallic state and, consequently, brought several structural changes
to the zeolitic framework. The structural changes brought by the H2 treatment can be accounted for the decreased Brönsted
acidity over the Lewis acidity of the adsorbents and thus helped in
improving their adsorption capacity. This paper provides new insights
on how the zeolitic framework changes affected the sulfur adsorption
capacity of MY, which is helpful for designing better adsorbents for
sulfur removal from oil.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Deep desulfurization for
producing ultra-low-sulfur transportation fuel is a topic of important
concerns with the increasingly more stringent environmental regulations
in the world.1 For instance, the latest
National (VI) standard for fuel oil in China requires that the sulfur
concentrations in gasoline and diesel should be less than 10 and 15
parts per million on weight basis (ppmw),2−5 respectively. Removal of the original
sulfur compounds, such as thiophene (TP), benzothiophene and their
derivatives, etc., from diesel and gasoline is still a big challenge
in petroleum refining. In recent decades, the hydrodesulfurization
(HDS) process has been established to be an effective way for removal
of sulfides, disulfides, and thiols and has been widely applied in
industrial oil refinery. However, it is difficult to remove the original
sulfur compounds in FCC naphtha with HDS since HDS requires rather
high cost including large hydrogen consumption, high reaction pressure
and temperature, and sacrificial unsaturated hydrocarbons.6−8 Therefore, attention has been paid to develop other processes for
deep desulfurization in order to meet the growing demand of ultra-low-sulfur
transportation fuels such as oxidative desulfurization, membrane separation,
bio-desulfurization, ionic liquid desulfurization, adsorptive desulfurization,9−13 etc. Among these new methods, adsorptive desulfurization has several
advantages like ease of operation and being able to acquire deep sulfur
removal under mild conditions. Obviously, one essential factor affecting
the competitiveness of the adsorptive desulfurization method is the
performance of adsorbents, including adsorption capacity and adsorption
selectivity.

Presently, a variety of adsorbents have been developed
by researchers.14−21 Most adsorbents are metal loaded activated carbon, alumina, zeolites,
mesoporous materials, and metal–organic frameworks. However,
it is still a big challenge to obtain high adsorption selectivity
to sulfur compounds over olefins and aromatics for an absorbant when
maintaining desirable adsorption capacity. From the point of view
of this requirement, Y-type zeolites modified with metal-ion exchanges
were found to have rather high adsorption capacities and high sulfur-removal
selectivity19−21 compared to other types adsorbents.

Besides
the great effort taken by the researchers to the exploratory searches
for high-performance sulfur-removal adsorbents, effort has also been
taken to the understanding of the sulfur-removal mechanisms in the
adsorption systems. It is obviously helpful for designing high-performance
adsorbents to deeply understand the key adsorption sites and the key
processes occurring on these sites. However, such understandings are
still quite poor in the literature for the zeolitic adsorbents in
general and for zeolite Y-based adsorbents for removing TP and its
analogues in particular.

Zeolite Y modified with metal-ion exchanges
often show a desirably large S adsorption capacity, especially Cu(I)-Y
obtained by reduction.21−23 For zeolites modified with ion exchange, a number
of researchers have reported that the Lewis acidic sites were active
adsorption sites, which adsorb TP molecules through π-interaction
or S-M interaction.16,24,25 After comparing the sulfur removal performance of zeolite Y ion-exchanged
with different types of metal, Yang et al.19,25 proposed that Cu(I)-Y showed excellent adsorption capacity via a
π-complexation between the Cu+ ion and the thiophenic
aromatic rings.

However, the potential effect of the Brönsted
acidic sites in the zeolitic framework, which can be generated during
the reduction process after ion-exchange did not cast enough attention
by Yang et al.25 Actually, the Brönsted
acidic sites were found to be active to catalyze some conversion reactions
of TP or TP derivatives, such as protonation, oligomerization, cleavage,
etc.2,24,26,27 For example, Song et al.2 reported that the protonation reactions of TP can be catalyzed by
the Brönsted acid sites, in particular, the ≡Si—OH—Al≡
sites, in HY and CeY. The protonation and the subsequent oligomerization
of TP lead to the blockage of zeolitic holes, which can significantly
cut the sulfur removal amount of the zeolitic adsorbents.

When
a transition metal cation occupying a zeolitic cationic site is reduced
by H2, the microstructure of the nearby tetrahedral (Si
or Al) sites can also be significantly changed. Such changes include
those of Si–OH groups and Brönsted acid sites, and in
principle such changes may significantly affect the sulfur removal
performance of the zeolitic adsorbents.2,24−27 However, few people paid attention to the role of such changes.
In particular, the reason for why Cu(I)-Y has large S adsorption capacity
is still far from clear.

This paper aims to shed more light
on how the H2-reduced metal loaded Y zeolite (MY, where
M = Cu or Ag in this work) enhances its adsorption capacity for TP
compared to the unreduced MY. To achieve this goal, the differences
between reduced and unreduced MY were systematically analyzed, and
how these differences were associated with the sulfur removal performances
was proposed through employing a series of characterization tools
including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). A mechanistic
scheme was proposed for explaining how the H2 reduction
led to the changes of the zeolitic tetrahedral sites and thus the
improvement of adsorption performance. The mechanistic insights provided
in this paper may help people design better zeolitic adsorbents for
sulfur removal from oils.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Adsorbent Characterization
2.1.1 Basic
Physiochemical Properties
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of NaY, Cu-Y-N2, Cu-Y-H2, AgY-N2, and AgY-H2. All of these samples showed a crystalline faujasite structure,
with peaks located at 6.18°, 10.12°, 11.89°, 15.63°,
20.32°, 23.66°, 27.03°, and 21.43° assigned to
(111), (220), (311),(331), (440), (533), (642), and (555) planes,
respectively.28 Compared to the NaY, CuY-N2, and CuY-H2 cases, a slight decrease was observed
for the intensity of the above characteristic peaks in the patterns
of AgY-N2 and AgY-H2. The peak intensity decrease
reflected a slight loss of crystallinity of AgY-N2 and
AgY-H2, partly due to the sintering of the loaded metal
component.29,30 Furthermore, there were two additional
peaks for both CuY-H2 and AgY-H2 over other
zeolites. Peaks located at 43.2° and 50.4° for CuY-H2 can be assigned to the Cu(0) crystalline phases,31 and peaks at 38.1° and 44.3° for AgY-H2 can be assigned to Ag(0) crystalline phases.32 The appearance of these peaks showed that after being calcined
in H2, the Cu(0) and Ag(0) components can be significantly
generated from Cu(II) and Ag(I) on zeolite Y.

Figure 1 X-ray diffraction patterns
of different adsorbents including NaY (black), CuY-N2 (blue),
CuY-H2 (green), AgY-N2 (red), and AgY-H2 (dark yellow) as indicated in the figure.

Figure 2 shows
the 77 K N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the
pore size distribution of NaY, CuY-N2, CuY-H2, AgY-N2, and AgY-H2. For all samples, the
isotherms can be identified as a type I isotherm, which is typical
for microporous solids. The absence of hysteresis loop in these isotherms
suggested that there were no noticeable mesopores. The surface area
and pore volumes of these adsorbents are shown in Table.1. It can be seen that the surface
area and pore volume decreased obviously, from 682 m2/g
and 0.34 cm3/g for NaY to 533 m2 /g and 0.27
cm3/g for AgY-N2, and to 622 m2/g
and 0.33 cm3/g for CuY-N2, respectively. These
decreases can be due to the crystallinity decrease of the adsorbents,
in particular, for the Ag case, after the metal loading, as reflected
by the XRD results (see Figure 1). Similar trends were observed for the surface area and pore
volume of CuY-H2 and AgY-H2 compared with those
of NaY. The mild loss of the surface area and pore volume observed
for AgY-H2 can be partly due to the structural damage caused
by the aggregation of metallic Ag, as reflected by the XRD results.

2.1.2 Characterization
of the Transition Metal States with XPS
Auger parameters
and 3d spectra are often used by researchers to analyze the valence
of transition metals in an XPS measurement.-33–35Figure 3a,b presents
the Ag 3d and Ag MNN Auger XPS spectra of AgY-N2 and AgY-H2, respectively. The binding energy (BE) of Ag 3d having two
peaks at 369.4 and 375.8 eV and the kinetic energy (KE) of Ag MNN
Auger structure having two peaks at 347.9 and 352.8 eV can be assigned
to the Ag(I) cations occupying the zeolitic cationic sites in AgY-N2.34 In contrast, the BE of Ag 3d
having two peaks at 368.2 and 374.5 eV and the KE of Ag MNN Auger
structure having two peaks at 351.6 and 357.6 eV for the case of AgY-H2 show that most the Ag component was reduced to the atomic
Ag(0) state. When the Ag(I) ions at the cationic sites were reduced,
in principle, the atomically dispersed Ag atoms were generated. Then,
part of the atomically dispersed Ag atoms tended to aggregate, which
was reflected by the new XRD features (2θ of 37 and 44°
in Figure 1) of AgY-H2.

Figure 3c,d shows
the Cu 2p detailed photoelectron XPS region and MNN Auger structure
of CuY-N2 and CuY-H2, respectively. The peaks
at the BE of 935.7 and 944.3 eV in CuY-N2 can be assigned
to a Cu(II)(OH)-O-zeolite structure according to the work of Tannenbaum
et al.,33 where they showed that Cu(OH)2 had two similar peaks. That is, the Cu(OH)+ occupied
the zeolitic cationic sites after the ion-exchange step. The band
at 933.5 eV can be ascribed to Cu(I) generated from auto-reduction19 of Cu(OH)-O-zeolite when calcined at a high
temperature. The BE of Cu 2d of 944.3 and 935.7 eV disappeared, showing
that almost all Cu(II) components were reduced for the CuY-H2 adsorbent. The BE of 932.5 eV for CuY-H2, slightly lower
than 933.5 for CuY-N2, can be assigned to mixing chemical
state of Cu(0) and Cu(I), as reported by Zhang et al.35 As described above, the XRD result for CuY-H2 (Figure 1) showed
that at least part of the Cu component existed in the metallic Cu(0)
state.

2.1.3 Acidic Site Characterization
The
DFTIR spectra of pyridine adsorbed on zeolite Y adsorbents are presented
in Figure 4. In all
of the spectra, two peaks located at ∼1450 and ∼1540
cm–1 can be clearly observed, and the assignments
of these two peaks have been well established in the literature.36−40 Pyridine adsorption on a Brönsted acid site leads to the
∼1540 cm–1 peak assigned to the ring deformation
vibration of pyridine. Meanwhile, pyridine adsorption on a Lewis acid
site leads to the ∼1450 cm–1 peak assigned
to the deformation vibration of C–H bonds. Although the quantitative
determination of the amount of acid sites with different types was
not available at present, the relative ratio of the amount of Lewis
acid sites over that of Brönsted acid sites (L/B ratio) can
be estimated by the relative area of the ∼1450 cm–1 band over the ∼1540 cm–1 one. Table 2 collects the L/B
ratios of the different zeolitic Y adsorbents. It can be seen from Table 2 that the L/B ratio
was increased for all the Cu/Ag loaded zeolite Y compared to the starting
material of NaY. Interestingly, the H2 treatment led to
a further higher L/B ratio than the N2 treatment for both
of the Cu and Ag loaded zeolites. As described in section 1, Lewis acid sites can adsorb
TP,16,24,25 and Brönsted
acid sites can catalyze the protonation and the subsequent oligomerization.2,24,26,27 Therefore, the L/B ratio of the adsorbents studied may be highly
associable with their performances of sulfur adsorption.

2.1.4 Si/Al Site Characterization by Solid-State NMR
Figure 5 shows the 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the Cu and Ag loaded Y zeolites with different
post-treatments. In order for a better description, the notation of
Si-n(OAl) is used to represent a Si site in the zeolitic
framework hereafter, where the integer n (in the
range of 0–4) is the number of Al atoms connected to this Si
site through an oxygen bridge (Al–O–Si). In principle,
a “Al–O–Si” bridge should have a cationic
site connecting to the bridging O atom, which can be occupied by a
metal cation like Na+ or a Brönsted acid site, i.e.,
H+. The chemical shifts located at 89, −94, −100,
and −105 ppm can be assigned to Si-3(OAl), Si-2(OAl), Si-1(OAl),
and Si-0(OAl) sites, respectively.41 The
Si-4(OAl) sites were not detected. In principle, since the Si-0(OAl)
sites did not have cationic sites, they can be considered as keeping
intact during the ion-exchange and gas treatment processes, compared
to other Si sites. In NaY, the Si-2(OAl), Si-1(OAl) sites contributed
to most of the Si sites, and their contributions were comparable to
each other. Comparison between the 29Si-MAS NMR spectra
of NaY and AgY-N2 showed that the structural environment
of the Si site did not have an observable change when Na+ was exchanged with Ag(I) (Figure 5a). However, further inspection of the two spectra
of AgY-N2 and AgY-H2 showed that the H2 reduction treatment led to a mild decrease in the amount of the
Si-2(OAl) sites over that of the Si-0(OAl) ones, and a dramatic decrease
for the Si-3(OAl) case.

Figure 5 29Si MAS NMR spectra for zeolite
Y-based adsorbents as indicated in the figure. (a) Comparisons of
AgYs with NaY. (b) Comparisons of CuYs with NaY.

Different to the case of AgY-N2, it can be clearly seen
that the contributions of the Si-3(OAl) and Si-2(OAl) sites over those
of the Si-0(OAl) ones were obviously decreased from the NMR spectra
of CuY-N2 (see the middle curve in Figure 5b). The H2 treatment led to a
further decrease in the contribution of the Si-2(OAl) sites.

For zeolitic materials, 27Al MAS NMR spectra may provide
important supplementary information to 29Si MAS NMR spectra
for understanding the behaviors of the tetrahedral sites (Si or Al)
in the zeolitic framework. Figure 6 shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectra with Cu
and Ag loaded zeolite Y with that of the starting material of NaY.
The main peak located at the chemical shift of 60 ppm was a typical
feature from the framework Al in zeolite Y42 for all adsorbents studied. AgY-N2 did not show noticeable
features of new Al species,42 and CuY-N2 only showed a rather slight feature at ∼0 ppm, indicating
that there was no significant dealuminization during both of the ion-exchange
processes and the N2-treatment processes.

Figure 6 27Al MAS NMR
spectra for zeolite Y-based adsorbents as indicated in the figure.
(a) Comparisons of CuYs with NaY. (b) Comparisons of AgYs with NaY.

Different from the case of N2-treated
zeolites, the feature (at 0 ppm) assigned for the extra-framework
Al species was observed on the spectrum of H2-treated zeolites.
This feature was mildly slight for CuY-H2 (while larger
than the case of CuY-N2) and obvious for AgY-H2. Therefore, the H2 treatment not only resulted in the
reduction of the chemical state of loaded metals but also dealuminization
in some extent.43,44 Both 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectra showed that CuY-H2 had less
extra-framework aluminum than AgY-H2. This trend was consistent
with the XRD results shown in Figure 1, which shows that the metallic Cu features in CuY-H2 were less obvious than the metallic Ag features in AgY-H2. The reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) was easier than the reduction
of Cu(II)/Cu(I) to Cu(0), which led to easier sintering and agglomeration
of Ag, resulting in a larger loss in the specific surface area and
pore volume for the Ag cases (see Table 2).

2.2 Study
of the Adsorptive Desulfurization Systems
2.2.1 Desulfurization
Performance
The desulfurization performance of different
adsorbents is shown in Table 3. It can be seen from Table 3 that both CuY-N2 and AgY-N2 showed
improved adsorption capacity for TP removal compared to NaY. CuY-N2 had a better adsorption capacity than AgY-N2 (79%
vs 61%). The adsorbents with H2 treatment had a substantially
higher sulfur capacity than the one with N2 treatment (about
79% vs 93 for the Cu case and 61% vs 75% for the Ag case).

See section 4 for more

b Metal contents
measured by XRF.

The above
adsorption capacities and the observed order were consistent with
the results reported by Yang et al.19 Through
a quantum chemical computation work, they showed that the adsorption
energy of TP on Cu(I)-Y and Ag(I)-Y was rather strong and stronger
than that of benzene. The desired adsorption energy of Cu(I) was due
to its specific electron configuration ([Ar]3d104s0). However, these understandings are rather insufficient to
explain the experimental data. For example, Ag(I) has a similar electronic
configuration ([Kr]4d105s0) as Cu(I), and the
sulfur removal rate of AgY-N2 was between those of NaY
and CuY-N2, even being closer to that of NaY. This question
became severe when it was considered that only part of Cu was in the
status of Cu(I) from the XPS results (Figure 3c,d). Another interesting question calls
for a better understanding of the case that when Ag(I) was reduced
to Ag(0) (Figure 3a,b)
and part of the metallic Ag components aggregated (Figure 1), the sulfur removal rate
increased. A similar question can be raised for the CuY case. Putting
together the experimental observations, one has to consider that the
zeolitic framework itself had a significant contribution to the overall
sulfur removal rate. The H2-reduction process, which led
to the reduction of the transition metal components, also brought
several changes of the zeolitic framework. In this context, how the
changes of the zeolitic framework brought by the H2-reduction
process influenced on the sulfur removal rate should be further investigated.

2.2.2 TP-Adsorption Systems Studied by In Situ DRIFT
Study
The in situ diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier Transformation
(DRIFT) spectra of TP adsorbed on different zeolite Y-based adsorbents
are presented in Figure 7. The 1460 cm–1 peak can be assigned to the deformation
vibration of a CH2 group around sulfur (−CH2–S) or near the double bond (CH2—C=C).45 This peak was obvious on NaY and AgY-N2, slight on CuY-N2, and nearly not observable on CuY-H2 and AgY-H2. Since there was no CH2 group
in an intact TP molecule, the appearance of the 1460 cm–1 peak was proposed to be an indication of the CH2 formation
due to the protonation of TP at its α-C site.46 The 1421 cm–1 peak belonged to the CH2 group bending in the TP oligomers as reported by Song et
al.2 The band at 1504 cm–1 was also related to the TP oligomers, showing that oligomerization
of TP occurred on absorbents.24 Compared
to the case of N2-treated MY adsorbents, the intensities
of bands at 1421 and 1460 cm–1 were near not observable
in the cases of H2-treated MY adsorbents. The absence of
these two IR bands in CuY-H2 and AgY-H2 indicated
that the protonation and the subsequent oligomerization of TP, occurring
on other adsorbents, were dramatically suppressed in these two adsorbents.
This suppression can be accounted for the decreased amount of Brönsted
acid sites over that of Lewis ones (see Table 2) since, in principle, the protonation and
the subsequent oligomerization of TP were always triggered by the
Brönsted acid sites.2,24,26,27 The band at 1396 cm–1 was assigned to the perturbed symmetric stretching vibration of
C=C in the fundamental ring of TP absorbed on the Y zeolites,
which had a 13 cm–1 red shift compared with the
case of TP weakly adsorbed on ZMS-5.20 The
3100 cm–1 peak was assigned to the =C—H
stretching of TP, and the 2946 cm–1 peak was assigned
to aliphatic C–H vibrations after the protonization of TP,
as reported by Chen et al.20 The presence
of the 2946 cm–1 peak on the cases of NaY, AgY-N2, and CuY-N2 and the absence of this peak on the
cases of AgY-H2 and CuY-H2 further supported
that the above hypothesis made from the 1421 and 1460 cm–1 peaks.

Figure 7 In situ DRIFT spectra of TP adsorbed on NaY (black), AgY-N2 (red), CuY-N2 (blue), AgY-H2 (green), and
CuY-H2 (dark yellow).

The inverted peaks appeared in the spectral region of 3600–3800
cm–1 also provided interesting information about
the interaction of the TP with the sites on all of the adsorbents
examined in this work. The DRIFT spectra of all adsorbents showed
a strong peak at 3698 cm–1 assigned to the residue
water loss after TP adsorption and a weak peak at 3750 cm–1 assigned to TP interaction with the non-acidic terminal silanol
(Si–OH) sites. The 3640 cm–1 inverse peak
was assigned to the bridging hydroxyls (≡Al—OH—Si≡), i.e., the Brönsted acid sites in the
zeolitic framework. As proposed by Song et al.,2,24 the
bridging OH sites are mainly responsible for the protonation reaction
of the adsorbed TP. The intensity of the 3640 cm–1 peak was obviously decreased in the CuY-H2 and AgY-H2 zeolites compared to the CuY-N2 and AgY-N2. This decreasing trend was highly associable with the decrease
in the peak intensity at 1460 and 1421 cm–1, both
being accounted for the decreased protonation and thus decreased oligomerization.

A Proposed Picture of the Active Sites on Metal
Loaded Y Zeolite for Adsorptive Desulfurization
Put together
all of the above-described results about both of the Ag and Cu loaded
Y zeolites and their TP adsorption systems, one can found several
relationships. These relationships will be described as follows in
forms of comparisons of the H2-treated MY adsorbents with
the N2-treated ones:(i) On the basis of sulfur adsorption capacity, the
H2 treatment led to a significant increase in TP removal
percentage compared to the N2 treatment (see Table 3).

(ii) The H2 treatment led to more reduced
oxidation state of the loaded metal on the adsorbents (Figure 3).

(iii) The H2 treatment led to a decreased
contribution of Brönsted acid sites to the overall acid sites
(Table 2). Correspondingly,
TP adsorption on the H2-treated metal loaded Y zeolites
presented a nearly non-observable IR signal of TP oligomerization
as well as that of TP-Brönsted OH interaction (Figure 7).

(iv) The H2 treatment led to much more
obvious changes in zeolitic Si sites, in particular in that the contribution
of the Si-3(OAl) sites was decreased (Figure 5). At the same time, the H2 treatment
led to the formation of extra-framework Al species.

(v) Accompanied with the decrease in the
3640 cm–1 peak assigned to the Brönsted acid
sites, the intensity of the 3675 cm–1 shoulder peak
appeared in the CuY-H2 and AgY-H2 zeolites,
which was absent in the CuY-N2 and AgY-N2 zeolites,
as well as in the original NaY zeolite (Figure 7).



Interestingly,
the above relationships stood for both of the AgY and CuY adsorbents.
Further inspection of these relationships showed that they can be
further associated with each other, and according to such associations,
the schematic illustrations for how a representative zeolitic cationic
sites, i.e., ≡Si—O(−cation)—Al≡,
changed in different steps of preparation are presented in Scheme 1 for both of the
Ag (Scheme 1a) and
Cu (Scheme 1b) loaded
zeolite Y.

illustration of the possible evolvement of a zeolitic cationic site,
i.e., ≡Si—O(−cation)—Al≡, during
the preparation of the AgY (Scheme 1a) and CuY (Scheme 1b) adsorbents. Panel (i) in Scheme 1 shows a structure of a zeolitic cationic
site in the starting material of NaY, where the cationic site is Na+ or H+, with the former having a predominant contribution.
When this site is occupied by H+, this site shows Brönsted
acidity. In principle, the O–Al bond in panel (i) is a coordination
bond, and this site can be also existed as in the structure shown
in panel (ii), where the Al site shows the Lewis acidity.47

When the ion-exchange was carried out,
the cationic site can had the structure shown in panels (iii) and
(iv) in Scheme 1, where
an Ag(I) ion occupied the cationic site. This site was unchanged during
N2 treatment (as reflected by the XPS results shown in
the upper curves in Figure 3a,b). When the AgY adsorbent was treated in H2,
Ag(I) was reduced to form metallic Ag(0) (see the lower curves in Figure 3a,b), residing near
to the O–Al moiety as shown in panels (v) and (vi).

The
evolvement of the cationic site in the CuY case can be similar as,
but somewhat more complicated than, that in the AgY case. When the
ion-exchange was carried out, the cationic site was occupied by a
Cu(I)(OH) ion and can have the structure shown in panels (vii) and
(viii) in Scheme 1.
When CuY was treated by N2, part of the Cu(II) components
undergo auto-reduction19 and transformed
into Cu(I) so that the structure evolved to the situation as shown
in panels (ix) and (x). The existence of both Cu(II) and Cu(I) component
was reflected by the XRD results shown in Figure 3c,d. When CuY was treated by H2, part of the Cu(II) components was reduced to Cu(I), and the other
part was reduced to Cu(0), with the structure of this site can be
expressed as in panels (xi) and (xii), respectively.

2.3.2 The Proposed Changes of a Si-3(OAl) Site in Particular in the
AgY Adsorbents
Scheme 1 described above have provided a general illustration for
how a ≡Si—O(−cation)—Al≡ site evolved
during different treatments of NaY. However, for a Si site in the
zeolitic framework, the evolvement process can be different when it
was connected to different numbers of the −OAl– moiety,
i.e., different n (n = 0–4)
values in the Si-n(OAl) sites. The Si-0(OAl) sites
did not have cationic sites, and the Si-4(OAl) sites were not observed
in the 29Si NMR measurement (see section 2.1.4 and Figure 5 as well). Compared to the Si-1(OAl) sites,
the contributions of the Si-2(OAl) and Si-3(OAl) sites to the overall
Si sites were decreased when AgY-H2, CuY-N2,
and CuY-H2 were prepared from NaY (vide supra). In order to better understand how the Si sites connected to multiple
−OAl– moieties evolved during the preparation process,
a schematic diagram (see Scheme 2) for illustrating the evolvement of a typical Si-3(OAl)
site during NaY changing to AgY was proposed as an example.

Scheme 2 Schematic
Diagram for Illustration of Possible Structural Changes of a Typical
Si-3(OAl) Site in NaY (Panels i, ii, iii, and iv) in AgY-N2 (Panels v, vi, vii, and viii) and AgY-H2 (Panels ix,
x, xi, xii, and xiii)
The asterisk mark “*”
indicates a possible Brönsted acid site and its evolving site.
See more details in the text.

Panel (i) in Scheme 2 contains three cationic
sites, with two sites being occupied by Na+ and one occupied
by H+/Na+. This model is thus constructed to
be close to a situation where most cationic sites were occupied by
Na+ in NaY, and only a small portion of sites were occupied
by H+, showing the Brönsted acidity of this site.
Since the Al–O bond in the Al–O–Si bridge is
a coordination bond, the model site can have several different isomers
as shown in panels (ii), (iii), and (iv) for example. Panels (ii)–(iv)
show the situations where part of the Al centers detach from the O–Si
moiety, showing the Lewis acidity of this site.47

When NaY was ion-exchanged with Ag(I) followed by
a N2 treatment, Ag(I) took the place of Na+,
and thus the model Si site may have the structure as shown in panels
(v), (vi), (vii), and (viii). Compared to the structures shown in
panels (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv), these four panels do not contain
changes in this Si site, which is consistent with the results from
the 29Si NMR spectra of NaY and AgY-N2 (see Figure 5a). When NaY was
ion-exchanged with Ag(I) followed by a H2 treatment, Ag(I)
took the place of Na+ first, and subsequently Ag(I) was
reduced to metallic Ag(0) [reflected by the XPS results (Figure 3a,b)] and H+ take the place of Ag(I). Therefore, this Si site should appear as
shown in panels (ix) and (x). It is reasonable to hypothesize that
the metallic Ag(0) atoms residing near the Al site may hinder the
formation of the Al–O bond, leading to the decrease in the
Brönsted acidity of this Si site. This hypothesis was supported
by the L/B ratio results shown in Table 2 and by the disappearance of the 3640 cm–1 peak (see Figure 7). When the metallic Ag(0) atoms aggregates to form
a larger cluster as shown in panel (xi), the large metal cluster may
further hinder the formation of the nearby Al–O bond. Part
of Ag(0) atoms may even aggregate to form clusters large enough to
show features in the XRD pattern (Figure 1 for AgY-H2), since in principle,
the XRD method is not able to detect metal particles with a very small
size, like less than 2–3 nm.

It is reasonable to anticipate
that when large metal clusters formed, the Si sites can be further
detach from the nearby Al sites so that these Al sites may transform
to extra-framework Al species as illustrated in panel (xii) in Scheme 2. The extra-framework
Al species information was reflected by the 27Al MAS NMR
spectra shown in Figure 6a. On the other hand, when a Si site as shown in panel (xii) was
formed, the connecting OH groups may undergo dehydration reaction,
and this Si site may appear as in panel (xiii) in Scheme 2. The newly generated OH group
connected to the Si sites shown in panels (xii) and (xiii) may be
reflected by the 3675 cm–1 shoulder peak appeared
in AgY-H2 zeolites (see Figure 7).

Similar models can be constructed
for the cases of the Si-2(OAl) sites and the cases in the CuY adsorbents.
The characterization results for the CuY adsorbents can also be explained
as the case of AgY, which will not be described in detail here.

2.3.3 How the H2 Treatment Step Helped Improved
the Sulfur Adsorption Capacity
The evolvement process of
a Si-3(OAl) site shown in Scheme 2 can also explain how the Brönsted acidity was
decreased during the H2 treatment process (see Table 2 and Figures 4 and 7). As is known for an ion-exchange process for zeolite, not all the
cations occupying the cationic sites will be replaced by the ions
in the solution.47 For the example of NaY
ion-exchanged with AgNO3 in this work, there is always
part the original cations (most of them being Na+ and a
small portion of them being H+) occupying the cationic
sites remaining unchanged during the ion-exchange process. In order
to represent this property of ion-exchange in Scheme 2, when the cationic site shown with an asterisk
“*” mark is occupied by H+ [see panels (i)
and (ii)], this site could be unchanged [see the “*”
marks in panels (v) and (vi)] after NaY transformed to AgY-N2. The Brönsted acidity of this site could be unchanged during
the whole treatment. In contrast to that, when NaY was transformed
to AgY-H2, the reduced metallic Ag(0) atoms [see in panel
(x)] and small Ag(0) clusters near the −OAl– moieties
may hinder the formation of the Al···O bond, cutting
down the Brönsted acidity of this site. More importantly, formation
of the Ag(0) clusters and the extra-framework Al species makes the
Si site isolated from the Al sites, and this Brönsted acid
site is completely transformed to a Si–OH group [see the “*”
marks in panels (xii) and (xiii)].

It has been well established
in the literature24,48 that a Brönsted acid site,
owing to its rather strong acidity, may trigger protonation of TP.
Our results also reinforced this point of view by the 1421 and 1461
cm–1 peaks in Figure 7. As is known, the oligomerization of TP is obviously
disadvantageous to the TP adsorption capacity since the oligomerization
products can easily block the zeolitic pore. Therefore, on one hand,
our results reinforced that the Brönsted acid sites on the
MY adsorbents catalyzed the protonation and oligomerization of TP,
thus were disadvantageous to the S adsorption capacity of the adsorbents.
On the other hand, the insight was provided that the H2 treatment, through affecting on the Si-2(AlO) and Si-3(OAl) sites,
in particular the latter ones, led to the decrease in the Brönsted
acidity over the Lewis acidity and finally helped improve the sulfur
removal performance of the MY adsorbents.

3 Conclusions
Through a systematic characterizations of metal
loaded zeolite Y (MY, M = Ag, Cu) adsorbents and the TP-adsorbent
systems, this work provides the following major findings in understanding
how the gas treatment processes affected the S adsorption capacity
of the adsorbents:(1) Compared to the N2 treatment, the H2 treatment
on the MY adsorbents led to the reduction of the loaded M components
to their metallic state, and consequently, the reduction process brought
several structural changes on the zeolitic framework. These changes
included decreased contributions of the zeolitic Si-2(OAl) and Si-3(OAl)
sites (in particular the latter ones) and generation of extra-framework
Al species, as observed by the NMR spectroscopic measurements.

(2) Compared to the N2 treatment case, the decreased Brönsted acidity over
Lewis acidity observed by the Py-DRIFT and TP-DRIFT experiments can
be well explained by the changes of the zeolitic framework brought
by the H2 treatment,.

(3) From the TP-DRIFT experiments, this work reinforced
that the Brönsted acid sites on the MY adsorbents catalyzed
the protonation and oligomerization of TP, thus were disadvantageous
to the S adsorption capacity of the adsorbents. Therefore, this paper
provides news insights on how the zeolitic framework changes affected
the zeolitic acidic property and thus were closely related to the
improvement of the S adsorption capacity of MY.



4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation
of Adsorbents
The zeolite Y-based adsorbents were prepared
with the ion-liquid exchange method for metal loading followed by
a gas post-treatment. In a typical preparation process, an aqueous
slurry having a volume of 150 mL containing 5.0 g of NaY (purchased
from Nankai Catalyst Co., and having a molar Si/Al ratio of 2.7, which
was confirmed by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) and AgNO3 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.) was stirred at 343 K for 5 h. Then,
the slurry was filtered, and then washed with a large amount of deionized
(DI) water. Then, the obtained wet powder was dried at 393 K in an
oven for 2 h and further calcinated in an N2 flow in a
quartz tube at 773 K for 4 h. The obtained dry powder is denoted as
AgY-N2 hereafter in this paper.

The preparation of
the AgY-H2 adsorbent had the same procedure as AgY-N2, with the only difference in that an H2 flow instead
of an N2 one was used in the final step of 773 K calcination.
Similarly, the preparation procedures of CuY-N2 and CuY-H2 were the same as those of AgY-N2 and AgY-H2, respectively, with taking the place of 2.54 g of AgNO3 with 3.62 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O.

All chemical reagents used in this work were analytically
pure, all gases used were of ultra-high purity, and DI water was used
throughout all experiments.

4.2 Adsorptive Desulfurization
Measurement
The adsorptive desulfurization performance test
was carried out with immersing a certain type of above-described adsorbent
of 1.0 g immersed in a model oil of 50 g (a solid-to-liquid mass ratio
of 1:50). The model oil was an n-heptane solution
of TP with a sulfur concentration of 500 ppmw. The whole mixture was
stirred for 2 h at room temperature. After the adsorption experiment,
the concentration of the sulfur element of the model oil was measured
by an ultraviolet fluorescence sulfur analyzer (multi EA 3100, Elementa).
Then, the sulfur removal efficiency, X, representing
the S adsorption capacity of the corresponding adsorbent used for
the performance test, was calculated by  where C0 and Ce are the concentrations of the S element in the model oil before
and after the adsorption experiment, respectively.

4.3 Adsorbent Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the prepared adsorbents were collected with a 2θ
range of 5–60° using a D/MAXRB XRD instrument (Rigaku,
Japan) equipped with Cu-K radiation.

The N2 adsorption
isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 micropore
size analyzer at 77 K.

X-ray fluorescence (XRF, PANalytical,
Netherlands) spectroscopy was used to measure the contents of Si,
Al, Cu, and Ag of the adsorbents.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic
(XPS) study of a certain adsorbent was performed with a hemispherical
analyzer (111) using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation
(Thermo Escalab 250Xi). The spectra were collected at pass energies
of 100 and 0 eV by a 150 W X-ray beam of 400 μm in diameter.
The sample was discharged at room temperature at a pressure of 10–8 Pa. The peak positions were internally referenced
to the C 1s peak at 284.9 eV.

The 27Al nuclear magnetic
resonance with magic angle spin (MAS NMR) and 29Si MAS
NMR spectra of a certain adsorbent were recorded by using a Bruker
DRX400 spectrometer. The 27Al MAS NMR was the sequence
used excitation with a 1 μs pulse (π/12) length by a small-angle
excitation pulse (15°). The sweep time was set to 30 ms, and
1000 sweeps were accumulated. KAl(SO4)2·12H2O was used as a reference compound for the chemical shift
of 27Al at 0.21 ppm. The MAS frequency was kept at 45 kHz
during the whole Al-spectrum collection process. The 29Si MAS NMR was the sequence used excitation with a 2 μs pulse
(hpdec) length. Kaolin was used as a reference compound for the chemical
shift of 27Si at −91 ppm. The MAS frequency was
125 kHz during the whole Si-spectrum collection process.

4.4 In Situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
(DRIFT)
In order to obtain molecular-level information about
the adsorption sites on a certain adsorbent, in situ DRIFT experiments
were carried out for the adsorption systems of pyridine-adsorbent
and TP-adsorbent. All DRIFT spectroscopic measurements were carried
out using a Thermo Nicolet Nexus FTIR spectrometer equipped with a
mercury cadmium telluride detector cooled with liquid N2. Each DRIFT spectrum was collected using 128 scans with a resolution
of 4 cm–1. Before a DRIFT experiment, a procedure
of TP/pyridine absorption on a certain catalyst at room temperature
was kept for 12 h, and desorption of the physically adsorbed TP/pyridine
was carried out at 120 °C in vacuum for 24 h. The same catalyst
without adsorption of adsorbate was used for collecting the background
spectrum.
