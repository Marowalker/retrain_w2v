Urea removal from dialysate is the
major obstacle in realization
of a miniature dialysis device, based on continuous dialysate regeneration
in a closed loop, used for the treatment of patients suffering from
end-stage kidney disease. For the development of a polymeric urea
sorbent, capable of removing urea from dialysate with high binding
capacities and fast reaction kinetics, a systematic kinetic study
was performed on the reactivity of urea with a library of low-molecular-weight
carbonyl compounds in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 323 K.
It was found that dialdehydes do not react with urea under these conditions
but need to be activated under acidic conditions and require aldehyde
groups in close proximity to each other to allow a reaction with urea.
Among the 31 (hydrated) carbonyl compounds tested, triformylmethane,
ninhydrin, and phenylglyoxaldehyde were the most reactive ones with
urea. This is attributed to the low dehydration energies of these
compounds, as calculated by Gibbs free energy differences between
the hydrated and dehydrated carbonyl compounds, which are favorable
for the reaction with urea. Therefore, future urea sorbents should
contain such functional groups at the highest possible density.

==== Body
Introduction
In the human body,
urea is a metabolite of nitrogen-containing
nutrients such as amino acids. These nutrients are metabolized in
the liver into the toxic base ammonia, which is rapidly converted
into urea by enzymatic processes. Urea is then transported through
the bloodstream to the kidneys, where it is excreted into the urine.1 The production of urea in the human body is 230–400
mmol/day.1,2 The majority of patients suffering from
end-stage kidney disease undergo single pass hemodialysis in a center
of three to four times per week to remove urea and other soluble waste
products such as potassium, phosphate, and organic compounds from
their body. However, the frequent and long visits to a dialysis center
compromise their participation in economic and social life. Home hemodialysis
therefore offers more flexibility and autonomy for dialysis patients.
However, a large complex dialysis machine is required at home in combination
with a large supply of dialysis fluids (≥30 L/treatment) or
a bulky immobile water purification system, which discourages many
patients from selecting home hemodialysis. A miniature dialysis device
based on continuous regeneration and reuse of dialysate in a closed
loop system, free from a fixed water supply, that can easily be used
at home and during travel would greatly enhance patient’s freedom
and autonomy.3,4 It would also facilitate more
frequent and longer hemodialysis enhancing blood purification, which
is expected to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life.5

In current miniaturize dialysis devices
that are under development,
ion exchangers are used to remove excess ions such as phosphate and
potassium, while most organic waste solutes such as creatinine and
uric acid can effectively be removed by activated carbon.6 However, efficient urea removal is still a major
obstacle in the development of a lightweight dialysis device.7 In principle, three strategies to remove urea
from blood dialysate are available: enzymatic conversion, electrochemical
degradation, and adsorption by a sorbent.8 Enzymatic conversion by immobilized urease, which has been used
in the first commercial portable dialysis device that was marketed
from 1973 to 1993 (REDY), results in formation of ammonium (NH4+) and carbon dioxide (CO2).9 The ammonium is removed by a large quantity of
a zirconium phosphate ion exchanger, which also captures calcium and
magnesium ions that need to be replenished from a reservoir, which
limits miniaturization of the device.3,10 Electrochemical
degradation of urea into nitrogen (N2), hydrogen (H2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) does allow miniaturization
of hemodialysis. However, this urea removal method also produces harmful
side products such as active chlorine species and reaction products
thereof such as chloroamines.8 Therefore,
ideally, a sorbent is applied that efficiently removes urea from dialysate
by physi- or chemisorption. These sorbent materials are required to
be stable that should not leach harmful compounds into the dialysate
and should adsorb high quantities of urea from aqueous solution at
a sufficient rate. Physisorption in general is a very fast, reversible,
and concentration-dependent process. However, all urea sorbents based
on physisorption known so far, such as activated carbon and zeolites,
have relatively low affinity for urea, and desorption will occur as
the urea concentration in the dialysate decreases in time.11,12 On the other hand, several polymeric chemisorbents that can bind
urea covalently through carbonyl groups have been reported.13−18 Despite the weak nucleophilicity of urea nitrogen, it still can
react with electrophilic carbonyl groups present in these sorbents
such as glyoxaldehydes,13,15 ninhydrin groups,14 α-keto-esters,16 and oxidized alcohols.17,18 Covalent urea sorbents
with binding capacities up to 2.0 mmol/g have been reported. However,
these materials suffer from slow urea binding kinetics at 37 °C
because only a part (1.2 mmol/g at most) of the urea-reactive groups
has reacted after 8 h, still requiring more than 330 g of this material
to remove the daily urea production (400 mmol).19

In the search for a more efficient polymeric urea
sorbent suitable
for incorporation in a miniature dialysis device, with high binding
capacity and fast reaction kinetics, we performed a kinetic study
on the covalent binding of urea with a library of low-molecular-weight
carbonyl compounds. In the literature, uncatalyzed covalent binding
of urea (derivatives) in water has been reported with compounds such
as ninhydrin,20−22 aromatic glyoxaldehydes,23 and other aldehydes.24 Based on these
reports, we systematically analyzed the kinetics of the reaction of
several aromatic carbonyl compounds and nonaromatic analogues thereof
with urea in aqueous solution representative for dialysate and determined
the second-order rate constant. It is expected that the kinetics of
the reaction of carbonyl compounds with urea decreases upon incorporation
of the carbonyl groups in a polymeric sorbent due to substituent effects22 and decreased accessibility of polymeric groups
as compared with molecules in solution. Still, this fundamental knowledge
can be used for the future design of urea sorbents with fast kinetics
and high binding capacities.

Results and Discussion
A carbonyl
compound can react with urea in a 1:1 molar ratio. Therefore,
first-order dependence in both urea and the carbonyl compound is expected
according to eq 1. Indeed,
in our previous work, we analyzed the kinetics of urea with ninhydrin
substituted with electron-donating groups (EDGs) and electron-withdrawing
groups (EWGs) and concluded that the reaction of these ninhydrin derivatives
with urea is first order in both urea and ninhydrin and thus second
order overall.22 Also, the reaction of
phenylglyoxaldehyde (PGA) with nucleophilic groups in enzymes such
as NH2 groups of arginine residues has been shown to be
first order in PGA.25,26 1  Quantitative 13C NMR was previously used as a robust method
to determine the k2 value of the reaction
of urea with ninhydrin
(Scheme 1).22 Using this method, 13C-enriched urea
and ninhydrin are reacted in stoichiometric amounts, and therefore,
their relative concentrations remain equal throughout the reaction
(eq 2). Simplification
of eq 1 using eq 2 results in eq 3 in which the second-order k2 value is determined by only measuring urea
concentrations in time. 2   3  

Scheme 1 Reaction of Ninhydrin,
a Vicinal Tricarbonyl Hydrate, with Urea21
The influence of temperature
on the rate of the reaction of ninhydrin
with urea was determined in phosphate-buffered aqueous saline (PBS)
at temperatures between 20 °C (293 K) and 70 °C (343 K).
The second-order k2 values were determined
from the plot of the inverse urea concentration in time (Section 2.1 of the Supporting Information), and
the ln(k2) values were plotted against
the inverse of the absolute temperature in the Arrhenius plot (Figure 1). Linear regression
and the use of Arrhenius equation resulted in a preexponential constant
(A) of (23.3 ± 0.6) × 109 and
an activation energy (Ea) of 14.0 ±
0.4 kcal/mol. To have reasonably fast kinetics, the reaction of the
carbonyl compounds with urea was carried out at 323 K unless stated
otherwise.

Figure 1 Arrhenius plot of the reaction of ninhydrin with urea in PBS. Linear
regression gives ln(k2) = −7073
(1/K) + 23.87. Arrhenius equation: ln(k2) = (−Ea/RT) + ln(A); thus, −Ea/R = −7073 K and ln(A) = 23.87.

First, hydrates of a
variety of similar vicinal tri- and tetraketones
were reacted with urea in PBS at 323 K. The structures of the tested
carbonyl compounds and the corresponding k2 values are listed in Table 1. 2,2-Dihydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopentane-1,3-dione
(entry 2) is an aliphatic analogue of ninhydrin and was tested to
investigate the influence of the aromatic ring on the reactivity of
the vicinal triketone with urea. 2,2,3,3-Tetrahydroxy-2,3-dihydronaphthalene-1,4-dione
(entry 3) is an analogue of ninhydrin that consists of four vicinal
ketones of which two form hydrates. To increase the number of urea-reactive
groups per gram of material, also, 2,2,6,6-tetrahydroxy-s-indacene-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetraone
(entry 4), which contains two triketone groups, was tested, together
with its nonaromatic analogue 2,2,5,5-tetrahydroxy-3a,6a-dimethyl-6-methylenetetrahydropentalene-1,3,4(2H)-trione (entry 5).

Ketone Hydrates and the Determined k2 Values
of Their Reaction with Urea in PBS at 323 K
a The compound is
probably converted
into ninhydrin during the reaction with urea.27

b Tested in 1:1 (v/v) DMSO/PBS
at
343 K due to its low aqueous solubility.

Only the aromatic derivatives of the tested vicinal
ketone hydrates
in Table 1 (entry 1,
3, and 4) reacted with urea. The urea concentration in the reaction
mixture containing oxolin (entry 3) did decrease in time; however,
the shift of the urea carbon peak in the 13C NMR of the
product corresponds to the shift of the same carbon in the ninhydrin–urea
adduct (Section 1.1 of the Supporting Information).
This suggests that the decrease in the urea concentration is not because
of the reaction of oxolin with urea but rather due to the conversion
of oxolin into ninhydrin27 that subsequently
reacts with urea forming the ninhydrin–urea product. In this
case, eqs 1–3 are invalid, and the rate observed cannot be used
to calculate the k value of oxolin with urea. Interestingly,
the k2 value of the reaction of entry
4 with urea substantially decreased by a factor of ∼20 when
compared to ninhydrin (entry 1), presumably due to the presence of
two EWGs on the opposite site of the aromatic ring, that decreases
the rate of dehydration of the hydrate, which is a required step to
allow subsequent reaction with urea.22

Because phenylglyoxaldehyde (PGA) has been reported to react with
urea derivatives,23 this compound (Table 2, entry 6) and an
aliphatic analogue (entry 7) were tested for the reaction with urea.
To increase the amount of urea-reactive groups per gram of material,
also, 2,2′-(1,3-phenylene)bis(2-oxoacetaldehyde), a compound
with an aromatic ring with two glyoxaldehyde functionalities, was
tested (entry 8). For the reaction of phenylglyoxaldehyde with urea,
the inverse of the urea concentration in time showed a nonlinear correlation
(Section 2.2 and Figure S5, Supporting
Information). Identification of the isolated reaction product after
24 h at 323 K in PBS by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies
showed that the initially formed urea–PGA product reacted with
another equivalent of PGA. This means that the urea concentration
did not remain equal to the PGA concentration during the reaction,
and eqs 2 and 3 are therefore invalid, explaining the nonlinear
correlation observed in the plot of the inverse urea concentration
in time. Scheme 2 shows
(A) the reaction of PGA with urea and (B) the proposed mechanism for
the formation of the isolated product. Since the final product was
isolated in a 57% yield with respect to PGA and is therefore the major
formed product, the reaction of the 1:1 adduct with a second molecule
of PGA must be faster than the initial reaction of urea with PGA.

Scheme 2 Reaction and Proposed Mechanism
(A) Reaction of hydrated PGA
with urea and (B) proposed mechanism of the reaction of the 1:1 PGA–urea
adduct with a second PGA molecule; conditions: 0.5 mmol of urea and
0.5 mmol of PGA in 16.7 mL of PBS (30 mM urea and PGA) at 50 °C.

Table 2 Structural Formulas of Tested Glyoxaldehydes
and the Corresponding k2 of Their Reaction
with Urea in PBS at 323 K
The k2 values of the reaction
of glyoxaldehydes
(Table 2, entries 6–8)
with urea were determined from the initial slope of the plot of the
inverse urea concentration in time using second-order polynomial regression
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). The k2 values for the different glyoxaldehydes tested
are listed in Table 2. To validate whether the slopes of the lines of Figure S5 can indeed be used for the calculation of the second-order
reaction rate constants, PGA was reacted with an excess (3–50
equiv) urea to decrease the probability of the reaction of the 1:1
adduct with another PGA molecule. Thus, pseudo-first-order (PFO) conditions
were obtained, and the rate constants (kPFO) were measured. In a control experiment, ninhydrin (30 mM) was reacted
with 5 equiv of urea (150 mM) in PBS, and the kPFO value was determined to be 1.0 ± 0.1 h–1 (Section 2.3 of the Supporting Information),
which corresponds to a k2 of 6.7 M–1 h–1 (1.0 h–1/0.15
M = 6.7 M–1 h–1), which is similar
to the k2 for ninhydrin (Table 1, entry 1). This validates that
the kPFO can indeed be used to determine
the k2 for the reaction of the carbonyl
compound with urea.

The kPFO values
for the reaction of
PGA with excess urea were plotted against the [urea] (Section 2.4 and Figure S8, Supporting Information),
and this figure shows that k2 (as defined
of the derivative of dkPFO/d[urea]) is
not proportional with [urea] but decreases with increasing urea concentration.
This is likely because of the dielectric constant of the medium changes,
which influences the reactivity of PGA greatly.25,26,28 Determination of k2 for PGA by extrapolating kPFO to 30 mM using polynomial regression resulted in a k2 of 3.7 M–1 h–1 (Figure S8 and Table S3, Supporting Information),
which is similar to k2 determined by the
initial slope of the plot of the inverse urea concentration in time
(Table 2, entry 6),
thus validating that this method is an accurate method to determine
the k2 of glyoxaldehydes.

As for
the vicinal ketone hydrates, the aromatic glyoxaldehyde
(entry 6) showed a faster reaction with urea than the aliphatic (entry
7) and doubly substituted analogues (entry 8), the latter presumably
also due to the decreased rate of dehydration of the hydrate in the
presence of the meta-positioned EWG.

The enol form of triformylmethane
(TFM) (entry 9 of Table 3) is a very electrophilic aldehyde,
which has been reported to react with urea to yield an enamine (Scheme 3).24 To further investigate the reaction of urea with other
aldehydes than TFM, one monoaldehyde and several dialdehydes were
selected, and their reaction kinetics with urea was tested (entries
10–13). In addition, electron-poor perfluorated ketones and
aldehydes were also tested (entries 14 and 15), as well as a strained
four-membered ring diketone (entry 16) and a dialdehyde that potentially
forms an aromatic system upon reaction with urea (entry 17 and Section 3 of the Supporting Information). The
structures of the selected aldehydes and ketones and the corresponding k2 values are listed in Table 3.

Scheme 3 Reaction of Triformylmethane with Urea24

and Ketones and the Determined k2 Values

a Measured at 293
K instead of 323
K to decrease the reaction rate.

b 1,1,3,3-Tetramethoxypropane was
stirred in PBS at pH 2 for 30 min at RT after which the pH was adjusted
(to pH 2 or 7.4), and urea was added to the reaction mixture.

c 2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran was
stirred in PBS at pH 2 for 30 min at RT after which the pH was adjusted
(to pH 2 or 7.4), and urea was added to the reaction mixture.

d Measured both in PBS and 1:1 PBS/DMSO
as solvent at 323 K.

In
the reaction mixture of urea with TFM (entry 9), the urea concentration
dropped very rapidly and remained constant after the first measurement
at 30 min and 323 K. Therefore, besides reacting with urea, we assume
that TFM was completely consumed by reacting with itself within this
timeframe (as reported by others; see Section 4 of the Supporting Information).29 To determine the k2 value with sufficient
accuracy, the reaction temperature was lowered to room temperature
(293 K), and the initial slope of the plot of the inverse TFM concentration
versus time (Figure S9, Supporting Information)
showed a k2 value of 18.4 M–1 h–1, which is 23 times faster than the reaction
of urea with ninhydrin at the same temperature (Figure 1 and Table S2,
Supporting Information) making TFM a very interesting compound to
build in a urea sorbent.

In contrast to entry 9, the monoaldehyde
(entry 10) and the 1,1-,
1,2-, and 1,3-dialdehydes (Table 3, entries 11–13) did not react with urea within
24 h at 323 K and pH 7.4. To allow the initially formed hemiaminal
to dehydrate and form a more stable imine, the pH was decreased to
pH 2 (at this pH, urea is not protonated, pKa of 0.1).30 Under these conditions,
the monoaldehyde still did not react with urea, whereas the dialdehydes
did react with urea (Table 3, entry 11–13). The formed hemiaminal will be in equilibrium
with the (hydrated) aldehyde. However, the presence of a second aldehyde
group makes a second intramolecular nucleophilic attack of urea possible,
thus driving the equilibria toward the urea-bound aromatic product
(Scheme 4). The results
presented in Table 3 show that the kinetics of the reaction with urea decreased with
increasing number of carbon atoms between the two aldehyde groups,
presumably due to the decreasing mutual inductive electron-withdrawing
effect of the aldehydes. Also, intramolecular ring closure likely
becomes less favorable when the distance between the urea nitrogen
and the aldehyde increases.

Scheme 4 Proposed Mechanisms
(A) Proposed mechanism of the
equilibrium between a monoaldehyde and urea in H2O; (B,
C) proposed mechanism of the acid-catalyzed terminating reaction (B)
between a 1,3-dialdehyde and urea in H2O31 and (C) between a 1,4-dialdehyde and urea in H2O.

Based on these results, we conclude that
to drive the equilibrium
with water toward the urea adduct, at least two carbonyl groups in
close proximity are required, allowing urea to react with both its
nitrogens, forming a five- or six-membered ring. TFM did not undergo
an intramolecular ring closure toward a cyclic product at pH 7.4 because
it can easily form a stable enamine at this pH (Scheme 3). Maltsev et al. have shown that under acidic
conditions, TFM, like the dialdehydes tested (entries 11–13),
undergoes an intramolecular ring closure into a six-membered ring.32

The electron-deficient fluorinated aldehyde
and ketone hydrates
(entries 14 and 15) did not react with urea under the applied experimental
conditions. Also, cyclobutanedione (entry 16) did not react with urea,
despite that the reaction with urea could cause release of the ring
strain because the hybridization of the carbonyl carbon would change
from sp2 to sp3 upon reaction with urea (Table 3, entry 16). The one
with the possibility to form an aromatic system upon reaction with
urea (Table 3, entry
17) as the possible driving forces did not react with urea, like many
other carbonyl compounds that were expected to react with urea but
did, in fact, not (listed in Section 1 of
the Supporting Information).

To understand why certain carbonyl
compounds and hydrates such
as ninhydrin and PGA react with urea, whereas carbonyl compounds and
hydrates such as hexafluoroacetone (entry 15) and 2,2-dihydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopentane-1,3-dione
(entry 2) do not, we calculated the changes in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for these reactions using a computational model that
we used in our previous study on the reaction of ninhydrin derivatives
with urea.22 Most of the carbonyl compounds
that we tested are predominately present in their hydrated forms.
Consequently, the first step in the reaction mechanism is the dehydration
of the hydrate and thus the formation of the carbonyl (as shown in Scheme 5 for ninhydrin).22,33 The ΔG of the dehydration of the carbonyl
compound was calculated (ΔGdehydration) as well as the subsequent reaction of the dehydrated carbonyl compound
with urea to form the intermediate adduct (ΔGintermediate). The structural formulas of the calculated
hydrated, dehydrated, and intermediate compounds are listed in Section 5.2 of the Supporting Information.

Scheme 5 Dehydration of Ninhydrin and Subsequent Reaction with Urea
By using a continuum solvent
model as an approximation in the calculations,
the solvation effects might not be accurately represented because
the model does not include interactions such as hydrogen bonding.
Additionally, the contribution of translational entropy to the Gibbs
free energy in the gas phase may be inaccurately treated in solution.
For these reasons, the obtained ΔG values should
not be considered absolute values, but they can be compared relatively
to each other as all reactions are dehydration or condensation. In
fact, actual ΔGdehydration should
be positive in most cases because the compounds listed in Table 4 are present as the
hydrate in water (with exception of TFM, entry A), and the free energy
of the hydrate should be lower than the free energy of the corresponding
carbonyl compound. NMR analysis showed that TFM is indeed mainly present
in its nonhydrated form, which corresponds to the lowest calculated
ΔGdehydration for this compound.
Interestingly, the compounds that react with urea at 323 K (entries
A–E) show a low ΔG value for dehydration
(−10.7 to −3.5 kcal/mol), whereas the hydrates that
show a relatively high value for dehydration (0.0 to 5.1 kcal/mol)
react slowly (entry F) or not (entries G–K) with urea at 343
K. This shows that the Gibbs free energy for dehydration of carbonyl
compounds gives a good indication for the reaction rate of the carbonyl
compound with urea and can be used to screen promising carbonyl compounds.

work.22

d Oxolin is converted into ninhydrin.

TFM shows a rapid reaction with
urea (Table 4, entry
A) despite the high ΔGintermediate because it is primarily dehydrated
in solution. Ninhydrin (entry B) has a less favorable dehydration
but a relatively low ΔGintermediate and shows relatively fast kinetics for the reaction with urea as
compared to the other hydrated carbonyl compounds. A clear trend that
lower values of ΔGdehydration and
ΔGintermediate coincide with a fast
reaction rate with urea is observed for entries C–E. Carbonyl
compounds F–K all have a relatively high ΔGdehydration; therefore, the concentration of the urea-reactive
species will be low, resulting in a rate constant of <0.1 M–1 h–1.

Conclusions
In
our aim to design an efficient polymeric urea sorbent, the kinetics
of the reaction of urea with carbonyl compounds was systematically
analyzed. TFM, ninhydrin, and PGA showed the fastest kinetics of their
respective class of compounds among the ones tested. Importantly,
to react with urea, at least two carbonyl groups are needed in close
proximity to allow both nitrogens of urea to react, resulting in the
formation of a stable five- or six-membered ring and effectively driving
the equilibrium with water toward the urea adduct. This trend is shown
for vicinal triketones, glyoxaldehydes, and dialdehydes. TFM, a trialdehdye
that is predominately present in its dehydrated form, showed the highest
reaction rate with urea and did not form a cyclic product but a stable
enamine instead. Computational studies suggest that for carbonyl compounds
with a relatively high ΔGdehydration, the dehydration of the hydrate is unfavorable and therefore the
concentration of the urea-reactive species is low resulting in a very
slow, often not measurable, reaction with urea.

To design urea
sorbents with fast reaction kinetics at physiological
conditions, suitable for incorporation in a miniature dialysis device,
the focus should be on introducing a high density of functional groups
such as TFM, ninhydrin, or PGA, for example, a polymer matrix.

Material
and Methods
General Procedure
All chemicals were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) and used as received
unless stated otherwise. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4;
ion composition: Na+, 163.9 mM; Cl–,
140.3 mM; HPO42–, 8.7 mM; H2PO4–, 1.8 mM) was obtained from B. Braun
(Melsungen AG, Germany). 1,1,3,3-Tetramethoxypropane and 2,6-dimethylhepta-2,5-dien-4-one
(phorone) were obtained from Combi Blocks (CA, USA). 4-Bromo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
and 1,1′-(1,3-phenylene)bis(ethan-1-one) were obtained from
AK Scientific (CA, USA). 2-Phenylmalonaldehyde was obtained from Apollo
Scientific (Manchester, U.K.). 2,2,3,3-Tetrahydroxy-2,3-dihydronaphthalene-1,4-dione
and [1,1′-biphenyl]-2,2′-dicarbaldehyde were obtained

was obtained from Enamine (NJ, USA). 3-Isothiocyanatoprop-1-ene was
obtained from FluoroChem (Hadfield, U.K.). NMR spectra of the different
compounds were recorded on an Agilent 400-MR DD2 equipped with a OneNMR
probe or a Bruker 600 MHz with a BBI probe at RT. The quantitative
1D 13C NMR experiments were carried out on the Agilent
400-MR DD2 using the standard s2pul.c pulse system with a spectral
width of 24038.5 Hz and an acquisition time of 1.363 s. Residual solvent
signals were used as internal standard (1H: δ 2.50
ppm, 13C (1H): δ 39.52 ppm for DMSO-d6; 1H: δ 7.26 ppm, 13C (1H): δ 77.16 ppm for CDCl3; 1H: δ 5.32 ppm, 13C (1H): δ 53.84
ppm for CD2Cl2). Chemical shifts (δ) are
given in ppm, and coupling constants (J) are given
in hertz (Hz). Resonances are described as s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), bs (broad singlet), and m (multiplet), or
combinations thereof. UV absorption spectra and intensities were recorded
with a BMG LABTECH SpectroStar Nano platereader using UV-Star Microplate
96 well obtained from Greiner Bio-One (Alphen aan de Rijn, The Netherlands).
Flash chromatography was performed over silica gel (particle size
of 40–63 μm, VWR Chemicals, Leuven, Belgium) using the
indicated eluent. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using
TLC plates from Merck Darmstadt, Germany, (SiO2, Kieselgel
60 F254 neutral, on aluminum with a fluorescence indicator), and the
compounds were visualized by UV detection (254 nm).

General Procedure
for the Kinetic Analysis of the Carbonyl Compounds
with Urea
The carbonyl compound of interest (0.5 mmol, 1.0
equiv) was dissolved in 16.7 mL of PBS or a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of DMSO
and PBS. 13C-labeled urea (31.5 mg, 0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
was added to the solution, and the mixture was stirred magnetically
at the indicated temperature for 2–96 h. Samples from the reaction
were taken at different time points, and the urea concentrations in
the different samples were determined by quantitative 13C NMR (see below). The kinetic experiment was continued until more
than 50% conversion was reached or when the urea concentration remained
constant. The k2 values for the carbonyl
compounds were determined from the plots of 1/[urea] versus time.

Determination of Urea Concentration by 13C NMR22
For the calibration curve, a stock
solution of 13C-labeled urea in PBS (50 mM) was prepared
and diluted to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 mM. A solution of Me2SO2 in D2O (1.50 mmol in 1000 μL,
1.34 M) was prepared and added to the analytes in a 10:1 ratio (1000
μL of analyte and 100 μL of internal standard). The mixture
was shaken, and 600 μL was transferred into an NMR tube. For
reaction mixtures in 1:1 PBS/DMSO, 200 μL of internal standard
solution was added to 1000 μL of reaction mixture and transferred
into an NMR tube. During the 1D 13C NMR experiments (101
MHz), proton signals were decoupled. FIDs were Fourier transformed
and automatic phase correction, and the third-order polynomial baseline
correction and automatic integration were applied with MestReNova
version 10.0.2-15465. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation
were within 10%. The ratios of integrals for urea at 162.08 ppm and
internal standard at 42.15 ppm were compared with those of the calibration
curve for calculating urea concentration in the samples.

Identification
of Urea-Dialdehyde Adduct under Acidic Conditions
2,5-Dimethoxytetrahydrofuran
(mixture of cis and trans) (0.5 mmol,
1.0 equiv) was dissolved in PBS, and the pH was adjusted with 1 M
HCl to pH 2 and stirred for 30 min at RT. Urea (300.3 mg, 5 mmol,
10 equiv) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated to 50 °C
and stirred for 5 h. The mixture was allowed to cool to RT and freeze-dried.
The crude mixture was purified over silica (EtOAc/MeOH 19:1), and
the 1H NMR spectra of the isolated compound corresponded
with 1H-pyrrole-1-carboxamide.34

Determination of Carbonyl Compound Concentration
by UV
A carbonyl compound stock solution (30 mM) in PBS was
diluted 30
times (4350 μL of PBS + 150 μL of 30 mM stock solution)
to a 1 mM stock solution. A calibration curve was prepared by diluting
the 1 mM stock solution to 0.005, 0.010, 0.020, 0.040, 0.060, 0.080,
0.100, and 0.120 mM with PBS. Samples of the solutions (200 μL)
were transferred into a UV-Star 96-well plate in triplo. The concentration
of the carbonyl compound in the reaction mixture was determined by
taking a sample and directly diluting it 300 times at RT (30 times
dilution; 150 μL of reaction mixture + 4350 μL of PBS)
followed by 10 times dilution (150 μL of sample + 1350 μL
of PBS) after which 200 μL was transferred into the UV-Star
96-well plate in triplo. The TFM, ninhydrin, or PGA concentration
in the samples was determined with the average UV absorption of 3
wells at 248, 232, and 250 nm, respectively.

Computational Studies
DFT calculations were performed
using the Gaussian 09 software package, using the B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter,
Lee–Yang–Parr) functional with 6-31 g(d,p) as the basis
set on all atoms.35 Structure optimizations
were carried out with water as a solvent without any symmetry restrains
in water. Frequency analyses were performed on all calculations. Input:
#B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) opt = tight freq scf = tight int. = ultrafine pop
= regular SCRF = (solvent = water).

Syntheses and Spectroscopic
Data
Synthesis of 4,4,3,3-Tetramethylcyclopentane-1,2,3-trione Hydrate36,37
Bromine (10.3 mL, 145 mmol, 2.0 equiv)
was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50 mL). The solution
was cooled to 0 °C,
and 2,6-dimethylhepta-2,5-dien-4-one (10 g, 72.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
was dissolved CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and added dropwise.
Next, the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The solvent
was evaporated, and the crude mixture was recrystallized from EtOH,
yielding 2,3,5,6-tetrabromo-2,6-dimethylheptan-4-one as a white solid
(27.8 g, 60.9 mmol, 84%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400
MHz, δ) main isomer: 5.15 (s, 2H), 2.02 (s, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, δ) main isomer: 193.88 (Cq), 62.83 (Cq), 59.62 (CH), 33.90 (CH3), 29.29
(CH3).

2,3,5,6-Tetrabromo-2,6-dimethylheptan-4-one
(50 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
was dissolved in cold pyridine (30 mL) and kept for 24 h at 0 °C
without stirring. The reaction mixture was transferred into a separation
funnel with CH2Cl2, washed with 30% H2SO4 (twice), H2O, and brine, and dried over
Na2SO4. After evaporation of the solvent, 3,5-dibromo-2,6-dimethylhepta-2,5-dien-4-one
was isolated as a brown oil, which started crystalizing when dried
under vacuum and at RT (5.35 g, 49 mmol, 98%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 2.04 (s, 6H), 1.99 (s, 6H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 101 MHz, δ): 190.25 (Cq), 144.98 (Cq), 115.64 (Cq), 25.99 (CH3), 22.55 (CH3).

3,5-Dibromo-2,6-dimethylhepta-2,5-dien-4-one (4.158 g, 16 mmol,
1.0 equiv) was dissolved in cold H2SO4 (2.56
mL, 48 mmol, 3.0 equiv) and stirred at 0 °C for 24 h. The mixture
was poured over crushed ice during which 3-bromo-2-hydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-en-1-one
precipitated. The resulting suspension was filtered, and the obtained
solid material was washed with water and dried under vacuum at RT,
yielding 3-bromo-2-hydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-en-1-one
in a 76% yield (2.8 g, 12 mmol). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 5.82 (bs, OH), 1.13 (s, 6H), 1.11 (s, 6H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 101 MHz, δ): 204.73 (Cq), 147.49 (Cq), 138.72 (Cq), 51.18 (Cq), 46.60 (Cq), 24.99 (CH3), 22.64 (CH3).

3-Bromo-2-hydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopent-2-en-1-one
(3.5
mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in cold acetic acid (4 mL) to which
bromine (178 μL, 3.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in acetic acid (4 mL)
was slowly added at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to
heat to RT and stirred for 2 h. The mixture was poured over ice and
rested for 10 min. The suspension was filtrated, and the obtained
solid material was washed with water and dried under vacuum, yielding
3,3-dibromo-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopentane-1,2-dione as a brown solid
in a 38% yield (419 mg, 1.34 mmol). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 1.39 (s, 6H), 1.34 (s, 6H). 13C NMR

(Cq), 73.32 (Cq), 50.68 (Cq), 46.92
(Cq), 25.45 (CH3), 24.10 (CH3).

The procedure as described by Gill et al. and Shoppee36,37 did not yield 2,2-dihydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopentane-1,3-dione
in our hands. Therefore, we modified the procedure inspired by the
work of Liang et al.38 3,3-Dibromo-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopentane-1,2-dione
(157 mg, 0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in DMSO (1 mL), and iodine
(0.1 mmol, 0.2 equiv) and water (0.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) were added.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 24 h after which
the resulting mixture was freeze-dried to remove DMSO. Purification
of the crude mixture over silica (hexane/EtOAc 1:1) yielded 2,2-dihydroxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethylcyclopentane-1,3-dione
as a yellow solid in a 90% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, δ): 6.02 (bs, 2H), 1.14 (s, 6H), 1.12 (s, 6H). These
peak shifts differ from those reported by Gill et al. and Shoppee
(δ: 1.20 (s, 6H) and 1.08 (s, 6H)). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 101 MHz, δ): 214.21 (Cq), 137.78 (Cq), 51.10 (Cq), 24.97 (CH3), 22.61 (CH3).

hydrate according to the procedure reported by Marminon et al.40s-Indacene-1,3,5,7(2H,6H)-tetraone (171 mg, 0.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
was dissolved in a 10:1 mixture of dioxane (3 mL) and H2O (0.3 mL) in a microwave tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer.
Selenium dioxide (275 mg, 2.5 mmol, 3.1 equiv) was added, and the
tube was sealed. The mixture was shaken vigorously until selenium
dioxide was dissolved, and the tube was placed in the microwave where
it was heated for 5 min at 180 °C. The crude reaction mixture
was impregnated on silica and purified over silica (8:1 CH2Cl2/MeOH), obtaining the product in a 30% yield (66 mg,
0.24 mmol). 1H NMR (DMSO, 600 MHz, δ): 8.45 (s, 2H),

in
DMSO, and 48% HBr (4.1 mL, 36 mmol, 12 equiv), 57% HI (171 μL,
1.5 mmol, 0.5 equiv), and I2 (380 mg, 1.5 mmol, 0.5 equiv)
were added. The mixture was stirred magnetically at 80 °C for
4 h. Afterward, the mixture was allowed to cool to RT and was extracted
with CH2Cl2 five times. The organic layers were
combined, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated
during which red crystals precipitated from the solution. After filtration,
the crystals were collected in a 36% yield (279 mg, 1.1 mmol). 1H NMR (DMSO, 400 MHz, δ): 10.68 (bs, 4H), 1.41 (s, 3H),
