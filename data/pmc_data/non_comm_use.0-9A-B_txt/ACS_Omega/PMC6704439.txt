Zeolites are microporous crystalline
materials widely used in catalysis
and adsorption applications. The fabrication of zeolite thin films
and membranes has also opened up the possibility of using zeolites
in electronic devices and membrane separations. The existing approach
to growing zeolite films involves exposing the substrate to a high-pH
environment; however, this process is applicable to only specific
types of substrates. Our group has developed the direct wet deposition
of zeolites via ultrasonic nozzle spray deposition to address this
issue; however, the relationship between wetting properties and thin-film
quality has yet to be investigated. In this study, we prepared zeolite
CHA (Si:Al:P = 3:10:20) suspensions using different solvents and surfactants
in various concentrations. We then examined the relationships among
the composition of the cast solution, their wetting behavior on the
glass substrate, and the uniformity of the resulting thin films. We
found that using ethanol as a solvent with zeolite crystals in low
concentrations with added surfactant yielded zeolite films of high
quality. We were also able to produce low-haze zeolite coatings on
glass. The zeolite coatings with high hydrophilicity and adsorption
capacity presented excellent antifogging capability.

1 Introduction
Zeolites
are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with a well-defined
pore topology and high thermal and mechanical stability. Zeolites
in a powder or pellet form have been broadly used in catalysis,1−4 adsorption,5,6 and ion exchange.7,8 Developments in zeolite thin films and membranes have also enabled
the application of zeolites in membrane-based separation9−11 and thin film-based electronics.12−16 The methods used in the fabrication of zeolite films/membranes
can be categorized into two classes. The first class requires the
formation of zeolite films/membranes during the crystallization of
zeolites, which involves in situ crystallization,17−19 seeded growth,20,21 and dry gel conversion.22,23 The second class requires
a zeolite suspension with fully grown crystals, which involves dip
coating,24,25 spin-on deposition,26−29 or spray deposition.14,30 The second class avoids the need to expose the substrate to a high-pH
environment during zeolite crystal growth, thereby making it possible
to deposit zeolites on silicon wafers,29,31,32 glass substrates,33,34 and aluminum
alloy.35,36

Ultrasonic nozzle spray deposition
(UNSD) is a relatively new technique
wherein ultrasonic vibrations are used to create a high-frequency
standing wave, which generates uniform droplets in the tens of micrometers.
The droplets formed from cast solution deposited on the substrate
form a homogenous film.37−41 UNSD has been used for the deposition of polymers42−46 and small organic molecules.47,48 Only a few reports have addressed the use of UNSD in the preparation
of zeolite films.14 Several factors can
affect the quality of zeolite films prepared using UNSD, including
the operating conditions for spraying, the composition of the cast
solution, and the wetting behavior of the solution on the substrate.
Our group has optimized the quality of zeolite films by varying the
operating conditions and composition of the cast solutions.14 However, the effects of wetting behavior of
the cast solution on deposition quality have yet to be reported.

In this paper, we examine the relationship between the wetting
properties of zeolite suspensions on a glass substrate and thin-film
quality using the zeolite CHA (Si:Al:P = 3:10:20). Water and ethanol
were used as solvents for suspending zeolites. Spreading dynamics
and contact angle measurements were applied to investigate wetting
behavior. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and UV–visible
spectroscopy were used to characterize the deposition quality on the
glass substrates. We also assessed the antifogging capability of uniform
zeolite CHA films cast on glass substrates.

2 Experimental
Design
2.1 Chemicals
Aluminum isopropoxide (98+%)
and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) solution (35 wt % in water)
were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 99%)
and ethanol (99.9%) were purchased from Merck. Phosphoric acid (85
wt % in water) and TWEEN 80 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
chemicals were used without further purification. The deionized (DI)
water used in the synthesis process was obtained using the ELGA PURELAB
Classic DI ultrapure water system.

2.2 Preparation
of Zeolite CHA Suspensions
The synthesis method used in this
study followed our previous report
with minor modifications.49 We added 2.0
g of aluminum isopropoxide to 8.25 g of TEAOH solution. The mixture
was placed in a perfluoroalkoxy alkane container with a maximum capacity
of 100 mL and stirred at 30 °C for approximately 1 h until the
solution became completely transparent. We then added 0.61 g of TEOS
to the solution and stirred it for 2 h, before adding 2.26 g of phosphoric
acid to obtain a final molar ratio of 1 Al(OPri)3:2 H3PO4:0.3 SiO2:2 TEAOH:30 H2O with a total mass of 13.1 g. The mixture was aged at room temperature
for 1 h under agitation and then transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave
(maximum capacity of 180 mL) to undergo a hydrothermal reaction in
a convection oven at 180 °C over a period of 8 h. Following the
hydrothermal synthesis, the suspension was then centrifuged at 20 000
rpm for 30 min using HERMLE Centrifuge Z 36 HK. The resulting supernatant
was decanted, and fresh water was added to the precipitate until it
reached the original mass. The centrifugation process was repeated
three times. After the last centrifugation, DI water or ethanol was
added to the precipitate comprising crystals of the zeolite CHA, until
it reached the original mass (approximately 12 g).

The water
suspension was diluted by six times (denoted as W-6×) to form
a cast solution. The ethanol suspension was subjected to various dilutions.
The suspension diluted by three times was denoted as E-3×, and
the remaining samples were named by analogy. TWEEN 80 was added to
some of the cast suspensions. E-6× with 2.5 mass percent of TWEEN
80 was denoted as E-2.5%, and the remaining samples were named by
analogy. All of the cast solutions were stirred at room temperature
prior to thin-film deposition via UNSD.

2.3 Substrates
for Thin-Film Deposition
Corning EAGLE XG alkali-free glass
with a thickness of 0.7 mm was
cut into squares (approximately 25 × 25 mm) prior to UNSD.

2.4 Characterization of Suspensions
The
equilibrium contact angle and the surface tension of the zeolite CHA
suspensions were measured using a DataPhysics DSA25E (Krüss,
Germany) contact angle measurement system. This involved releasing
a 5 μL droplet of the suspension from a micropipette onto the
surface of the glass substrate. The top-view shape evolution of a
suspension droplet on the glass substrate was recorded using a charge-coupled
device camera from which the spreading area was analyzed using ImageJ.50

2.5 Preparation of Zeolite
CHA Thin Films
Zeolite CHA suspensions W-6×, E-3×,
E-6×, E-10×,
E-2.5%, and E-15% were used in the UNSD on 25 × 25 mm glass substrates.
The UNSD device in this study (model: USD-1515) was purchased from
Nano Optical Coating Technology Inc. This system is equipped with
an ultrasonic atomizer nozzle operating at a frequency of 60 kHz with
tunable piezo power between 0.5 and 5.0 W. Nitrogen was used as the
carrier gas at a pressure of 10 psi during the coating process. The
nozzle-to-substrate distance was fixed at 60 mm, and the injection
flow rate of the cast solution was maintained at 1 mL/min. The moving
pathway of the nozzle across the substrates is illustrated in Figure S1. The moving speed of the nozzle along
the y-axis was maintained at 200 mm/s, and moving
speed along the x-axis was maintained at 100 mm/s.
After UNSD, the coated substrates were placed in an oven and baked
at 100 °C for 1 h. Thin-film samples were then transferred to
a furnace for calcination. The temperature in the furnace was increased
from room temperature to 550 °C (at a heating ramp rate of 1
°C/min), where it was held for 6 h. Following calcination, the
thin-film samples were ready for material characterization.

2.6 Material Characterization
The micromorphology
of the thin-film samples was analyzed using optical microscopy (OM,
Whited WM-100) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800).
SEM was operated at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. A thin layer
of gold was deposited on the samples prior to SEM characterization.

Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the thin films was
performed using a PANalytical X’Pert diffractometer with a
Cu Kα source operated at a voltage of 45 kV and an incident
angle of 1°, scanning from 5° to 35° 2θ with
a step size of 0.02°.

The haze of the various thin-film
samples was measured according
to ASTM Method D1003 using an Agilent Cary 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The measurements were obtained using a double beam with a spectral
bandwidth of 2.0 nm at a scanning rate of 600 nm/min.

The wettability
of the thin-film samples was determined according
to contact angles recorded using a DataPhysics (Krüss, Germany)
DSA25E contact angle measurement system. This involved releasing a
water droplet of 5 μL from a micropipette onto the thin-film
surface and monitoring the evolution of the droplet.

Antifogging
properties were evaluated by placing thin-film samples
over a glass of boiling water (approximately 40 mL). Photographic
images were recorded after the samples had been exposed to water vapor
for 30 s. The samples were then dried using a high-pressure nitrogen
gun and stored under ambient conditions for 24 h prior to the next
test. The antifogging test was repeated seven times for evaluating
the durability of the zeolite films.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Effects of Solvents
Figure S2 presents photographic images
of the zeolite suspension
in water (W-6×) and ethanol (E-6×). We did not observe pronounced
precipitation in either suspension after standing for 24 h, indicating
that the suspensions were highly stable. Nonetheless, the deposition
of W-6× and E-6× on the glass substrate resulted in samples
with remarkably different surface morphologies, as shown in Figure 1. The W-6× presented
poor wetting behavior on the glass substrate prior to baking, which
resulted in a highly nonuniform surface after baking. In contrast,
the E-6× presented good wetting behavior, which resulted in a
highly homogeneous thin film on the substrate. This is a clear indication
that the solvent plays a key role in the wet deposition of zeolites.

(3rd row) of zeolite CHA thin films prepared using (a) W-6× and
(b) E-6×.

Suspensions (W-6×
and E-6×) and pure solvents were measured
in terms of contact angle and surface tension (Figure 2). The contact angle of W-6× (37.5°)
was relatively higher than that of E-6× (as low as 0°).
The surface tension of W-6× (74.4 mN/m) was approximately three
times higher than that of E-6× (23.3 mN/m). The high surface
tension of W-6× resulted in droplets with a high contact angle
in order to minimize the free energy of the system, resulting in poor
wetting on the glass. In contrast, the low surface tension of E-6×
permitted complete wetting51 on the substrate,
which resulted in a uniform surface morphology of the deposition.
The slow evaporation of water may also explain the poor uniformity
of thin films prepared using W-6×.52,53

contact angles on the glass substrate and surface tensions
of water, ethanol, and various zeolite CHA suspensions.

There was almost no difference between E-6×
and pure ethanol
in terms of contact angle and surface tension; however, there was
a notable difference between W-6× and pure water. Such dewetting
behavior can be attributed to the particle–fluid interaction
in W-6× and the long-range electrostatic interactions among zeolite
particles.54,55 The surface tension of W-6×
was slightly lower than that of pure water, probably due to the presence
of zeolite particles creating density fluctuations in the suspension,
which destabilized the droplets.56 The
above results suggest that ethanol is superior to water as a solvent
for the deposition of zeolite CHA. Thus, we limited subsequent analysis
to samples prepared using ethanol.

We investigated the degree
to which the concentration of zeolite
particles in the suspensions affects deposition quality. E-6×
suspension was concentrated by two times to produce E-3×, and
diluted by 1.67 times to produce E-10×. The SEM images of the
thin films formed by the three suspensions are presented in Figure 3. Ring patterns at
the scale of tens of micrometers were observed in E-3× and E-6×.
It is likely that these patterns are examples of the coffee-ring effect,
in which colloidal particles are carried radially outward via capillary
flow during the evaporation of the solvent.57−59 The ring patterns
were less noticeable in E-10× than in E-3× and E-6×,
which suggests that the dilution of the zeolite CHA suspensions facilitated
the merging of droplets during solvent evaporation, thereby suppressing
the coffee-ring effect.

of (a) E-3×, (b) E-6×, and (c) E-10×.

We studied the spreading dynamics of the three
suspensions and
pure ethanol in order to gain insight into the effects on deposition
quality. Figure 4 presents
results of droplet spreading area versus time. We found that the maximum
droplet spreading area decreased with an increase in the concentration
of colloidal particles. The small maximum spreading area of E-3×
suggests that the solvent may have fully evaporated before droplets
merged with adjacent droplets. This finding is in good agreement with
the pronounced coffee-ring effects observed in E-3×. The droplet-spreading
rate can be quantified using the slope in a log–log plot (Figure 4b).60,61 The slope of pure ethanol, E-10×, and E-6× was approximately
0.60, whereas the slope of E-3× was 0.51. The relatively slow
spreading of E-3× can be attributed to the high viscosity caused
by the high concentration of colloidal zeolite particles.62

spreading area vs time.

3.2 Effects of Surfactants
Nonionic surfactants,
such as TWEEN 80, are widely used to stabilize the cast solutions
used in the deposition of zeolite thin films.16,49,63,64 In this study,
we used TWEEN 80 to minimize the coffee-ring effects during the deposition
of the zeolite CHA films. The zeolite suspension in ethanol (E-6×)
with TWEEN 80 added at wt % of 2.5 and 15 are, respectively, denoted
as E-2.5% and E-15%. Figure S3 presents
photographic images of suspensions with various TWEEN 80 contents.
We found that E-2.5% and E-15% were both highly stable. Figure 5 presents photographic, OM,
and SEM images of thin films deposited using these two suspensions.
Samples E-2.5% and E-15% did not present ring patterns, probably due
to the addition of TWEEN 80 prior to wet deposition. According to
previous reports,63,65,66 the minimization of coffee-ring effects can be attributed to an
increase in viscosity following the addition of surfactants. The SEM
images revealed a larger number of void spots in E-15% than in E-2.5%.
This can be attributed to the fact that micelles formed by the surfactant
increased interparticle spacing during deposition, which ultimately
resulted in void spots after calcination.67 The contact angles of E-2.5%, E-15%, and pure ethanol were all close
to zero; however, the surface tension of E-2.5% and E-15% was slightly
lower than that of pure ethanol (Figure S4).

Figure 5 Photographic images (1st row), top-view OM images (2nd row), and
SEM images (3rd and 4th row) of zeolite CHA thin films prepared using
(a) E-2.5% and (b) E-15%.

We examined the spreading dynamics of E-2.5% and E-15% to
gain
insight into the differences in deposition quality (Figure 6). E-2.5% and E-15% both showed
faster spreading dynamics (i.e., larger slope in the log–log
plot) than did the suspensions in the absence of surfactants (E-3×,
E-6×, and E-10×). This can be attributed to two factors.
First, the surfactant reduced the overall surface tension of the solution.68 Second, the presence of surfactants resulted
in a more homogeneous distribution of zeolite colloids throughout
the suspension.69 Despite a similar spreading
rate, the spreading area of E-2.5% exceeded that of E-15%. This can
be attributed to the fact that a higher concentration of TWEEN 80
resulted in higher viscosity, which hindered the spreading of the
suspension. Nevertheless, the addition of surfactants to zeolite cast
solutions greatly enhances the spreading rate and suppressed the coffee-ring
effect, which helped to create a highly uniform coating.

area vs time.

3.3 Antifogging
Properties
The coatings
with relatively high quality (E-6×, E-2.5%, and E-15%) were subjected
to antifogging tests. One requirement of an antifogging film is low-transmission
haze. The haze of the three samples was qualitatively analyzed using
photographic images (Figure 7a). Samples E-2.5% and E-15% presented less haze than did
E-6×. Quantitative analysis of transmission haze was conducted
using UV–vis spectroscopy. The spectral average values are
summarized in Figure 7b. The quantity of transmission haze presented by E-2.5% and E-15%
was close to that of bare glass. In contrast, E-6× presented
remarkably higher transmission haze than did the other samples. High-transmission
haze is usually caused by pronounced light scattering.70−72 The micrometer ring patterns in sample E-6× caused strong light
scattering. E-15% possessed slightly higher haze than did E-2.5%.
This may be due to light scattering is induced by an excessive number
of void spots, as shown in the SEM images in Figure 5. The thickness of thin film E-6×, E-2.5%,
and E-15% was determined using the cross-sectional SEM images (Figure S5), which suggests a thickness of approximately
900 nm for these three samples.

Figure 7 (a) Photographic images of various zeolite
CHA thin films 7.5 cm
from letters beneath; (b) haze measurements of various zeolite CHA
thin films.

Antifogging tests were
conducted on a bare glass substrate as well
as the zeolite thin-film samples. The tests involved exposing samples
to hot water vapor for a period of 30 s, and a photo was recorded
for assessment of the antifogging property. The samples were stored
under ambient conditions for 24 h between each test. Seven tests were
conducted on each sample. The results of the 1st, 5th, and 7th tests
(E-6×, E-2.5%, and E-15%) are summarized in Figure 8a. All three samples showed
good antifogging capability in comparison to the bare glass, and E-15%
presented the best results. More specifically, trace numbers of small
droplets formed on E-6× and E-2.5%, whereas no droplets were
observed on E-15% during the tests. The results are in good agreement
with the wettability analysis of zeolite CHA thin films (Figure S6), which showed that sample E-15% possessed
a lower water contact angles than E-6× and E-2.5% did. This suggests
that the high surface hydrophilicity of E-15% may explain its good
antifogging performance. XRD analysis (Figure 8b) was used to gain insight into the differences
in antifogging capability. All of the samples possessed high crystallinity
of the zeolite CHA phase; however, the ratio of the amorphous phase
in sample E-15% was higher (a higher intensity hump between 17 and
30° 2θ) than that of the other two samples. In our previous
research,33 we determined that a high ratio
of amorphous phase can have a negative effect on antifogging performance;
however, our findings in this study contradict those results. It is
possible that these voids assist in the diffusion of water vapor in
zeolite films, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the zeolite
layer in the adsorption of water molecules. The unique microstructure
of E-15% may play a key role of its antifogging performance. We placed
the best-performed sample, E-15%, in an ultrasonic bath for 30 and
60 s, and partial peel-off was observed (Figure S7). The improvement of the adhesion between the zeolites and
the glass substrates is necessary before the commercialization of
the antifogging coating present in this work.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the relationships among the composition
of zeolite suspensions, wetting behavior of the suspensions on the
substrate, and the quality of zeolite CHA thin films (Si:Al:P = 3:10:20)
deposited using UNSD. We found that ethanol was superior to water
when used as a solvent for the dispersion of zeolite crystals. Zeolite
suspended in ethanol produced thin films of relatively high uniformity
on glass substrates when applied using UNSD. This can be attributed
to the good wetting behavior of ethanol on glass substrates as well
as its rapid evaporation. Reducing the concentration of zeolite crystals
in the cast solution or adding surfactant (TWEEN 80) was shown to
eliminate nonuniform patterns in the thin films. Both of these approaches
were shown to enhance the spreading dynamics of the zeolite colloidal
solutions on the glass substrate. In our analysis, we observed a positive
correlation between spreading dynamics and thin-film quality. The
zeolite CHA crystals deposited on the glass substrate using UNSD under
the optimized conditions presented low haze and good antifogging properties.
We also found that the antifogging performance was related to
the degree of thin-film crystallinity. Specifically, the well-defined
pore topology of the highly crystalline zeolite films was shown to
assist in the adsorption of water vapor, thereby improving antifogging
performance. In summary we identified the key parameters affecting
the uniformity and antifogging capability of the zeolite thin films
prepared using the direct wet deposition, and the information presented
in this work could be used to extend the fabrication of zeolite thin
films to a variety of substrates for a range of applications.
