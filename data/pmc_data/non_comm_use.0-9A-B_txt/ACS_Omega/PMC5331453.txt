The emergence of drug-resistant superbugs
remains a major burden
to society. As the mortality rate caused by sepsis due to superbugs
is more than 40%, accurate identification of blood infections during
the early stage will have a huge significance in the clinical setting.
Here, we report the synthesis of red/blue fluorescent carbon dot (CD)-attached
magnetic nanoparticle-based multicolor multifunctional CD-based nanosystems,
which can be used for selective separation and identification of superbugs
from infected blood samples. The reported data show
that multifunctional fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles are capable
of isolating Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella DT104 superbug
from whole blood samples, followed by accurate identification via
multicolor fluorescence imaging. As multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs
are resistant to antibiotics available in the market, this article
also reports the design of antimicrobial peptide-conjugated multicolor
fluorescent magneto-CDs for effective separation, accurate identification,
and complete disinfection of MDR superbugs from infected blood. The
reported data demonstrate that by combining pardaxin antimicrobial
peptides, magnetic nanoparticles, and multicolor fluorescent CDs into
a single system, multifunctional CDs represent a novel material for
efficient separation, differentiation, and eradication of superbugs.
This material shows great promise for use in clinical settings.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Center for Global Health
predicts that drug-resistant superbugs
kill 700 000 people per year and pose a fundamental threat
to human health.1−4 World Health Organization indicates that by 2050, superbugs could
be responsible for 10 million deaths per year, more than the number
of people who die from cancer yearly.1,2 Sepsis due
to blood stream infection is one of the major health problems with
a mortality rate of more than 40%.1−3 The high mortality rate
is mainly due to the absence of technology available in clinics which
can rapidly detect and identify bacteria from clinical blood samples
in the early stages of infection.3−8 The present “gold standard” used in clinics is bacterial
blood cultures for 24–48 h and then susceptibility testing
for drug resistance.3−8 The whole process requires several days to obtain accurate results.
Because patients need to be treated at the time of the visit, physicians
prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics.6−12 This general approach not only is inadequate to treat patients who
have drug-resistant infections but also encourages antibiotic resistance.8−14 Owing to the inability of the current methods to provide accurate
results in a short time, new technology that can be used to rapidly
diagnose drug-resistant superbugs in a point-of-care setting is needed.1−8 On the basis of this need, this article reports the design of multicolor
fluorescent carbon dot (CD)-conjugated magnetic nanoparticle-based
multifunctional nanosystem for the selective separation and accurate
identification of superbugs from infected blood samples.

Carbon
dots (CDs) are quasispherical particles of diameters less
than 5 nm, whose surface contains multiple oxygen-containing moieties.15−30 Because they can be produced from inexpensive starting materials
in large scale and exhibit remarkably bright multicolor photoluminescence
due to quantum confinement effects, CDs hold great promise for daily-life
applications.31−41 Similarly, magnetic nanoparticles have been used commonly for the
magnetic separation of targeted biological molecules from blood.16,30,42,43 Several recent reports show that the separation of targeted molecules
from blood is necessary to minimize light scattering and autofluorescence
during imaging.15,16,30,42,43 In this approach,
the magnetic properties of the multifunctional CDs have been used
for the removal of superbugs from the blood sample, providing effective
separation and enrichment, a key step in the diagnosis of superbugs
in the early stage of an infection. The CDs can be used to visualize
different superbugs via multicolor fluorescence imaging to provide
accurate diagnosis. To demonstrate that the multifunctional fluorescent
magneto-CDs can be used for the analysis of different types of superbugs
in a clinical setting, citrated whole blood samples purchased from
Colorado Serum Company were inoculated with a trace level of multidrug-resistant
(MDR) strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella enterica serotype
typhimurium definitive phage type 104 (DT104) at different colony-forming
unit densities. Experiments have demonstrated that bioconjugated multifunctional
fluorescent magneto-CDs are capable of capturing both types of superbugs
from the whole blood samples and accurate identification each by multicolor
fluorescence imaging.

Because the Salmonella DT104 strain
is resistant to several antibiotics, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol/florfenicol,
spectinomycin/streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines, and also
no new antibiotics for this superbug has emerged, the development
of alternative antimicrobial agents is urgent.1−8 Antimicrobial peptides are natural and synthetic oligopeptides that
are highly promising antimicrobial agents against superbugs by bolstering
the host’s defense and modulating the immune response.8−13,38−40 Pardaxin (Gly-Phe-Phe-Ala-Leu-Ile-Pro-Lys-Ile-Ile-Ser-Ser-Pro-Leu-Phe-Lys-Thr-Leu-Leu-Ser-Ala-Val-Gly-Ser-Ala-Leu-Ser-Ser-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gln-Glu)
is a well-documented pore-forming peptide with antimicrobial activity
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through the
disruption of bacterial membranes and the arachidonic acid cascade.12,13 By combining pardaxin antimicrobial peptides, magnetic nanoparticles,
and multicolor fluorescent CDs into a single system, the multifunctional
CDs represent a novel material for total separation, complete differentiation,
and accurate identification of superbugs.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Design of Blue and Red
Fluorescent Carbon
Dots Using Phenylenediamine
CDs exhibiting strong blue fluorescence
were synthesized by hydrothermal heating of meta-phenylenediamine
in ethanol using a reported method.26 Similarly,
the red fluorescent CDs were synthesized by microwave-assisted heating
of para-phenylenediamine using a reported method.26 The experimental details are described in the Methods. Following the synthesis, we purified the
particles using silica column chromatography and then characterized
them using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).
We have also used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the
size in solution. Freshly prepared blue fluorescent CDs are ∼6
nm in diameter, as shown in the HR-TEM image in Figure 1A.

2.2 Synthesis and Characterization of Blue/Red
Fluorescent Magneto-CD Nanoparticles
For the development
of multicolor multifunctional CD-based nanosystems, initially we synthesized
carboxylic acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles using coprecipitation
method from ferric chloride and 1,6-hexanedioic acid, as we reported
before15,16,30 and as shown
in Schemes 1 and 2. The black Fe3O4 nanoparticle
precipitate was separated from the supernatant using a neodymium magnet
and thoroughly washed several times with water. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were characterized using HR-TEM and DLS.

Red Fluorescent Hybrid Nanomaterials
The resultant HR-TEM image is shown in Figure 1C; particles have an average
size of about
∼40 nm. DLS results reported in Table 1 also indicate that an average size is of
40 ± 5 nm for magnetic nanoparticles. Superparamagnetic properties
were measured using a SQUID magnetometer, which indicates a specific
saturation magnetization of 41.8 emu g–1 for the
magnetite nanoparticles we developed. In the next step, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
(EDC)-mediated esterification was used to produce magnetic nanoparticles
attached with blue-red fluorescent CDs, as we have reported before.15 The final product, amide-coupled blue/red fluorescent
CD–Fe3O4 nanoparticles, was separated
using a magnet and washed several times with water to remove the excess
CDs. HR-TEM, elemental mapping by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy,
elemental mapping, and DLS results are reported in Figure 1 and Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1D shows the HR-TEM image for
∼55 nm-diameter purified blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles.
It is noteworthy to observe that multifunctional CD-based nanosystems
are about 15 nm larger than the unreacted magnetic nanoparticles.
The EDX data shown in Figure 1D indicate the presence of iron, carbon, and oxygen in multifunctional
CD-based nanosystems. The DLS data reported in Table 1 confirm a size of about 55 nm for blue fluorescent
multifunctional CD-based nanosystems and 50 nm for red fluorescent
magneto-CD nanoparticles. We determined superparamagnetic properties
using the SQUID magnetometer, which indicate a specific saturation
magnetization of 38.8 emu g–1 for the red magneto-CD
nanoparticles and 36.2 emu g–1 for the blue magneto-CD
nanoparticles.

Figure 1G,H shows
the emission spectra from multicolor multifunctional CD-based nanosystems
at 380 nm excitation. Experimental data indicate λmax of emission for blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles of around
462 nm and around 630 nm for red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles.
We used quinine sulfate as a standard (QY 54%) for the measurement
of photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) for magneto-fluorescent CDs
using our reported method.13−16Equation 1 was used to calculate the QY for blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles14−26 1  where the blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticle
is termed “mcd” and the quinine sulfate, which was used
as the standard, is termed “ref”. The photoluminescence
QY is denoted as Φ, and the absorbance, fluorescence intensity,
and refractive index are denoted as A, I, and η, respectively. Using experimental results and eq 1, the QYs for blue fluorescent
CD and blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles were determined to
be 0.51 and 0.28 at 380 nm excitation. Similarly, the QYs for red
fluorescent CD and red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles were determined
to be 0.24 and 0.12 at 380 nm excitation.

Figure 1G shows
that the multicolor multifunctional CD-based nanosystems exhibit blue
and red fluorescence, when excited at 380 nm UV light. Consequently,
selective and simultaneous targeted imaging of drug-resistant MRSA
and Salmonella DT104 is possible using
magneto-CD nanosystems.

2.3 Developing Antibody-Conjugated
Blue-Red Fluorescent
Magneto-CD Nanoparticles
For selective binding, separation,
and luminescence imaging of Salmonella DT104, we have developed anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles. To
accomplish this, we have developed amine-conjugated polyethylene glycol
(NH2–PEG)-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles
and then Salmonella DT104-targeted
antibody was attached with blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles,
utilizing our reported method.14,15,30 As shown in Scheme 1B, we have used EDC/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry for the
formation of covalent bonds between the carboxyl groups of PEG and
the primary amine groups of anti-MRSA antibody. Similarly, for selective
binding and imaging of MRSA, we have developed anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles using the above procedure.
In this case, we have first developed PEG-coated red fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles and anti-MRSA antibody was then attached to the hybrid
nanoparticle via EDC/NHS chemistry, as shown in Scheme 2B.

2.4 Determining the Possible
Nanotoxicity and
Photostability
To determine the possible nanotoxicity from
our synthesized nanoprobes, we have determined the biocompatibility
of the antibody-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles.
For this purpose, around 18 000 CFU/mL Salmolella DT104, MRSA, and Escherichia coli bacteria were incubated separately with antibody-attached blue fluorescent
magneto-CD nanoparticles for 24 h. Similarly, 1.2 × 105 cells/mL normal skin HaCaT cells were incubated separately with
antibody-attached multifunctional CD-based nanosystems for 24 h. In
the next step, the number of live cells was counted using the colony-counting
method37,39,40 for bacteria
and MTT test14−16 for HaCaT cell lines. Figure 2A shows excellent
biocompatibility for the multicolor multifunctional CD-based nanosystems,
where more than 97% of bacteria or HaCaT cells are alive after one
day of incubation.

Figure 2 (A) Viability of cells treated with blue fluorescent CDs.
(B) Fluorescence
intensity for anti-MRSA-antibody-attached blue-red fluorescent CD
nanoparticles as a function of time.

To determine the photostability of our synthesized multicolor
multifunctional
CD-based nanosystems, time-dependent luminescence experiments have
been performed using 380 nm excitation for around 1.5 h exposure. Figure 2B
indicates excellent photostability for red-blue fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles remain, where the luminescence intensity changed only
less than 5% even more than 1 h of exposure to light.

2.5 Capturing and Identifying Salmonella DT104 and MRSA from Infected Blood
To determine whether
multicolor multifunctional CD-based nanosystems could be used for
capturing and imaging Salmonella DT104
and MRSA superbugs separately and together from the infected sample,
103 CFU/mL of superbugs were injected into 10 mL of citrated
whole rabbit blood.

Then, 106 cells/mL peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were added into the mixture, which
was gently shaken for over 90 min.
The mixture was used as an infected blood sample for separation and
imaging. Then, different concentrations of anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles were added to the infected
blood sample and mixed continuously for half an hour. In the next
step, targeted MRSA-bound magneto-CD nanoparticles were separated
from infected blood using a magnet. Finally, we used reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, colony plating technique,
and fluorescence mapping analysis15,30,37−39 to determine the percentage of
superbugs that were captured, as reported in Figure 3. The RT-PCR data reported in Figure 3A indicate that around 100%
of the MRSA was captured by the magneto-CD we developed. The colony-plating
data reported in Figure 3B also indicate complete capture of superbugs. Figure 3C shows the TEM image, which indicates that
magneto-CD nanoparticles are attached on the surface of MRSA. In Figure 3D, the red fluorescence
image of MRSA superbugs indicates that bioconjugated magnetic-CD nanoparticles
are capable of identifying MRSA. Figure 3E shows that the anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles do not conjugate with different
cells that are present in the infected blood. This lack of binding
resulted in no luminescence image for the supernatant following magnetic
separation. The above-reported data indicate that anti-MRSA-antibody-conjugated
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles can be used to separate and
identify MRSA superbugs from the infected sample.

using both anti-MRSA-antibody-attached red fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles and anti-Salmonella blue
fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles. (G) Luminescence image of MRSA
and Salmonella superbugs after capture
by the two nanoprobes.

To determine the selectivity for superbug capturing and identification
of MRSA superbugs, the same experiment was performed using Salmonella DT104 superbug at different concentrations.
As reported in Figure 3A, our experimental data indicate that anti-MRSA-antibody-conjugated
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles are highly selective for
MRSA. Thus, Salmonella DT104 superbug
capture efficiency was less than 1%.

Next, to understand how
versatile multicolor fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles are for simultaneous capturing of MRSA and Salmonella DT104 superbugs, experiments with spiked
blood samples containing both MRSA and Salmonella DT104 were performed. In this case, 103 CFU/mL MRSA and
103 CFU/mL Salmonella DT104
were infected in the whole blood sample containing 1 million PBMCs.
For separation and identification of both MRSA and Salmonella DT104 at the same time, anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles and anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles were
added together in 10 mL of the infected blood sample. Figure 3F shows the RT-PCR
data, which indicate that the multicolor multifunctional nanoprobes
can be used for more than 98% separation of different superbugs from
the infected sample. Figure 3G shows the multicolor luminescence image that reveals that
anti-MRSA-antibody-attached red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles
and anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached
blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles together can be used for
the simultaneous identification of MRSA and Salmonella DT104. In the reported multicolor luminescence data, the red fluorescent
superbug images are MRSA and blue fluorescent superbug images are Salmonella DT104. The reported data clearly support
the premise that different antibodies-attached multicolor fluorescent
magneto-CD nanoparticles can be used for capturing MRSA and Salmonella DT104 superbugs selectively and simultaneously
from infected whole blood. Although we have shown that anti-Salmonella-antibody-conjugated blue fluorescent nanoparticles
can be used for the separation and imaging of Salmonella DT104, because selectivity is highly dependent on anti-Salmonella antibody, it may not be able to separate Salmonella DT104 from a mixture of other closely
related Salmonella strains such as Salmonella typhimurium. Similarly, anti-MRSA-antibody-conjugated
red fluorescent nanoparticles may not be able to separate MRSA from
the mixture of other closely related Staphylococcus strains such as Staphylococcus aureus.

2.6 Targeted Capturing and Killing of Salmonella DT104 and MRSA
Because MRSA and Salmonella DT104 superbugs are resistant to several
antibiotics, pardaxin antimicrobial peptide-conjugated anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles and pardaxin antimicrobial
peptide-conjugated anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached
blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles were developed. For this
purpose, amine groups of pardaxin antimicrobial peptides were attached
to the acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticle using EDC/NHS cross-linking
via amide linkage. To determine whether the superbugs captured by
antimicrobial peptide-conjugated fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles
are alive or dead, magnetically separated particles were washed with
water and then colony-counting technique was used to determine the
percentage of live superbugs. Sample experiments in the absence of
antimicrobial peptide conjugation were performed. As shown in Figure 4A–D, almost
100% of MRSA and Salmonella were killed
when pardaxin antimicrobial peptide-conjugated fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles were used.

Figure 4 (A) Percentage of live MRSA, when superbugs
are captured by (i)
anti-MRSA-antibody-attached fluorescent CD nanoparticles, (ii) anti-PSMA-antibody-attached

anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached fluorescent
magneto-CD nanoparticles. (C,D) Agar plates of superbugs incubated
(C) after being captured by a mixture of anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles and anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles and
(D) after being captured by a mixture of pardaxin antimicrobial peptides-conjugated
anti-MRSA-antibody-attached red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles
and pardaxin antimicrobial peptide-conjugated anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles. (E) Plot shows how the percentage of live MRSA varies
with the dosage level of pardaxin antimicrobial peptides.

On the other hand, more than 98% of superbugs were
alive when pardaxin
antimicrobial peptides are not conjugated with fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles. The observed very high killing efficiency of pardaxin
antimicrobial peptide-conjugated fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles
can be due to several facts. It is now well-documented that pore-forming
peptides such as pardaxin exhibit great cytotoxicity against Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria.12,13 It is also reported
that pardaxin is capable of elevating caspase-3/7 activities and disruption
of the mitochondrial membrane potential.12,13 Pardaxin is also
capable for accumulation of reactive oxygen species production.12,13 All above-described mechanisms are responsible for the death of
superbugs in the presence of pardaxin antimicrobial peptide-conjugated
fluorescent magneto-CDs nanoparticles. To understand the limit of
dosage of the antimicrobial peptide to eradicate MRSA and Salmonella DT104 superbugs, we performed pardaxin
concentration-dependent study, as reported in Figure 4E, which indicates that 1.8 μg/mL pardaxin
is necessary to kill 100% of MRSA. A similar experiment was performed
for Salmonella DT104, and we found
that 2.4 μg/mL pardaxin is necessary to kill 100% of Salmonella DT.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, this article reports the development of multicolor
fluorescent CD-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles that are capable
of selective separation and accurate identification of superbugs from
infected blood. The new means of capturing and identifying MRSA and Salmonella DT104 superbugs from clinically relevant
samples is clearly demonstrated. The reported data show that multicolor
multifunctional CD-based nanosystems are capable of isolating MRSA
and Salmonella DT104 superbugs from
whole blood samples, followed by accurate identification via multicolor
fluorescence imaging. Although we have shown that anti-Salmonella-antibody-conjugated blue fluorescent nanoparticles
can be used for Salmonella DT104 imaging
and anti-MRSA-antibody-conjugated red fluorescent nanoparticles can
be used for MRSA imaging, we can use either blue or red fluorescent
nanoparticles to image MRSA/Salmonella or other superbugs, just by changing the specific recognition unit
such as antibody. Because multidrug-resistant superbugs are resistant
to the antibiotics available in the market, the design of pardaxin
antimicrobial peptide-attached multicolor fluorescent magneto-CDs
for effective separation, accurate identification, and complete disinfection
of MDR superbugs from infected blood is also reported. The reported
data indicate that by combining pardaxin antimicrobial peptides with
fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles, one can develop a novel multifunctional
material that has great potential to be used for the identification
of MDRB infection in clinics.

4 Methods
All chemicals including meta-phenylenediamine, para-phenylenediamine, ethanol,
CH2Cl2 and MeOH, NaBH4, NH2–PEG, FeCl3·6H2O, and 1,6-hexanedioic
acid were purchased
from Fisher Scientific and Sigma-Aldrich. Superbugs, such as multidrug-resistant Salmonella DT104 and MRSA, and growth media were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD).

4.1 Development of Blue Fluorescent Carbon Dots
Using meta-Phenylenediamine
Blue fluorescent
CDs were synthesized by hydrothermal heating of meta-phenylenediamine in ethanol using a reported method,26 as shown in Scheme 1. In brief, 0.9 g of meta-phenylenediamine was dissolved in 90 mL of ethanol. Then, the mixture
was heated in an autoclave at 180 °C for 12 h. After that, the
gray-colored blue fluorescent CDs were then further purified using
silica column chromatography using CH2Cl2 and
MeOH (1:1) as eluants. Yield: 0.09 g, 10%.

4.2 Development
of Red Fluorescent Carbon Dots
Using para-Phenylenediamine
The red fluorescent
CDs were synthesized by microwave-assisted heating of para-phenylenediamine using a reported method,26 as shown in Scheme 2. In brief, 0.027 g of para-phenylenediamine was
dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol, and the mixture was heated for 60 min
using a domestic microwave oven (900 W). During this process, a mixture
of ethanol and water (1:1) was added into the flask continuously.
After that, the resultant solution was dried by solvent evaporation
and further purified by silica column chromatography using a mixture
of ethanol and ethyl acetate (1:1) as eluants. Yield: 0.014 g, 50%.

4.3 Design of Carboxylic Acid-Conjugated Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
We designed carboxylic
acid-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles
using the co-precipitation method using ferric chloride and 1,6-hexanedioic
acid, as we reported before15,16,30 and as shown in Scheme 1. details were reported before.15,16,30 At the end, Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were separated from the supernatant using a magnet.

4.4 Design of Blue-Red Fluorescent Magneto-CD
Nanoparticles
For the covalent attachment of blue-red fluorescent
magneto-CDs with acid-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, EDC-mediated
esterification was used, as we reported before.15 The final product, amide-coupled blue-red fluorescent CD–Fe3O4 nanoparticles, was separated using a magnet
and washed several times with water to remove the excess CDs.

4.5 Development of Antibody-Conjugated Fluorescent
Magnetic Nanoprobes
For selective binding, separation, and
luminescence imaging of Salmonella DT104,
we developed an anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached
blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles. To accomplish this, we
developed amine-conjugated polyethylene glycol (NH2–PEG)-attached
blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles, and then Salmonella DT104-targeted antibody was attached with
blue fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles, utilizing our reported
method.14,15,30 As shown in Scheme 1B, we used EDC/NHS
chemistry for the formation of covalent bonds between carboxyl groups
of PEG and primary amine groups of anti-MRSA antibody. Similarly,
for selective binding and imaging of MRSA, we developed anti-MRSA-antibody-attached
red fluorescent magneto-CD nanoparticles using the above-mentioned
procedure. In this case, we first developed PEG-coated red fluorescent
magneto-CD nanoparticles, and then anti-MRSA antibody was attached
to the hybrid nanoparticle via EDC/NHS chemistry, as shown in Scheme 2B.

4.6 Development of Pardaxin Antimicrobial Peptide-Conjugated
Hybrid Nanomaterials
Because MRSA and Salmonella DT104 superbugs are resistant to several antibiotics, pardaxin antimicrobial
peptide-conjugated anti-MRSA-antibody-attached red fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles and pardaxin antimicrobial peptide-conjugated anti-Salmonella-antibody-attached blue fluorescent magneto-CD
nanoparticles were developed. For this purpose, amine groups of pardaxin
antimicrobial peptides were attached to the acid-functionalized magnetic
nanoparticle using EDC/NHS cross-linking via amide linkages.

4.7 Superbug Sample Preparation
Salmonella DT104 and MRSA were purchased from the
ATCC and then cultured according to the ATCC protocol, as we reported
before.37,39,40 For the preparation
of infected blood sample, different concentrations of Salmonella DT104 and MRSA were prepared by diluting
the stock solution.

4.8 Multicolor Luminescence
Imaging of Captured
Superbugs
For the fluorescence imaging of Salmonella DT104 and MRSA superbugs, we used an Olympus
IX71 inverted confocal fluorescence microscope fitted with a SPOT
Insight digital camera, as we reported before.14−16,30

4.9 Finding the Percentage
of Live Superbugs
After being magnetically captured, Salmonella DT104 and MRSA superbugs were transferred
to colony-countable plates
and incubated for 1 day. The percentage of live superbugs was determined
using a colony counter (Bantex, model 920 A).
