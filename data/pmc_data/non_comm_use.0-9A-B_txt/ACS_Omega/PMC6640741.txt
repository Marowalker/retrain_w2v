Hybrid halide perovskite
thin films are applicable in a wide range
of devices such as light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and photodetectors.
The optoelectronic properties of perovskites together with their simple
and inexpensive film deposition methods make these materials a viable
alternative to established materials in these devices. However, the
potential of perovskite materials is compromised by the limitations
of the existing deposition methods, which suffer from trade-off among
suitability for large-scale industrial production in a batch or roll-to-roll
manner, deposition area, film quality, and costs. We addressed these
limitations by developing a deposition method that is inexpensive,
applicable to large substrate areas, scalable, and yields high-quality
perovskite films. In this study, the low-cost electrodeposition (ED)
method and sequential exposure to reagent vapors produce CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films with thickness nonuniformity
below 9% on a centimeter scale. PbO2 films are electrodeposited
first and then undergo two vapor conversion steps, with HI vapor in
the first step and CH3NH3I vapor in the second
step. The second step yields CH3NH3PbI3 films that are continuous and consist of micrometer-sized grains.
This process allows the preparation of both α- and β-phase
CH3NH3PbI3 films, offers a simple
means to control the film thickness, and works over a wide range of
film thicknesses. In this work, films with thicknesses ranging from
100 nm to 10 μm were prepared. ED and vapor conversion are inherently
scalable techniques and hence the process described herein could benefit
application areas in which large device areas and throughput are required,
such as the production of solar cells.

Introduction
Hybrid halide perovskites
(hereafter perovskites), such as CH3NH3PbI3 (hereafter MAPbI3), are a recently emerged class
of materials that can be employed
in light-emitting diodes (LEDs),1,2 thin-film transistors
(TFTs),3 optically pumped lasers,4 photodetectors,5,6 resistive switching
random access memory (ReRAM),7 and solar
water splitting;8 however, they are perhaps
the most known for enabling high efficiency in solution-processed
photovoltaic devices. Perovskites are commended for their inexpensive
processing methods as well as for their optical and electronic properties.
These properties, for example, allow perovskite-based solar cells
to reach efficiencies comparable to those of other established thin-film
solar cell technologies, such as those that employ cadmium telluride
or copper indium gallium selenide.9

Perovskite devices with different architectures are described in
the literature. The photovoltaic architectures are the most diverse
ones, with the devices relying on mesoporous scaffolds,10−12 nanostructures,13−16 planar thin films,17−19 and hybrids thereof, whereas other perovskite application
areas mostly rely on thin-film architectures.2−4,7 Of late, in the area of high-efficiency perovskite
photovoltaics, the focus has moved to architectures composed of planar
thin films.20,21 For perovskite films, uniformity
and low grain boundary density (large grains) are some of the major
requirements for improving device performance.3,7,22,23 The most common
approach for depositing perovskites is spin coating.24 Spin-coating approaches can be further divided into those
relying on single-step,25 two-step,11 and solvent-engineering21 methods. All of these methods are capable of producing perovskite
films of sufficient quality. However, in spin coating, the film quality
deteriorates with increasing deposition area. For that reason, devices
prepared using spin-coating-based approaches typically have areas
of a couple of square centimeters or less.2,6,7,26 For example,
the most efficient perovskite solar cells commonly have areas of about
0.1 cm2.27 Devices with larger
areas therefore require alternative perovskite deposition methods,
which are scalable.

Several scalable deposition methods that
do not involve spin coating
are applicable for perovskites. These methods rely on physical vapor
deposition (PVD),17,28 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),29,30 atomic layer deposition (ALD),31 electrodeposition
(ED) combined with conversion in solution,32 spray deposition (SD),33,34 and the doctor blade
(DB) technique.35,36 Methods employing solutions,
such as ED, SD, and DB, yield less-uniform films with a higher grain
boundary density, whereas uniform perovskite films, typically with
a low grain boundary density, are produced by vacuum techniques, such
as PVD, CVD, and ALD. Because vacuum techniques are more expensive
than solution-based methods, the existing scalable approaches for
perovskite film deposition offer trade-offs between quality and cost.

Herein, we attempted to preserve the advantages of both quality
and low-cost by first converting electrodeposited PbO2 films
into PbI2 films with HI vapor and subsequently converting
PbI2 films into MAPbI3 films with CH3NH3I vapor. We further explore the features of this deposition
approach and film properties, such as thickness controllability and
uniformity, that are important in a variety of perovskite film application
areas. ED is a simple and inexpensive method that is applicable for
the deposition of uniform coatings on substrates with areas on the
order of square meters and with complex shapes.37,38 Therefore, ED of
PbO2 fulfills the low-cost and scale-up requirements. On
the other hand, conversion of PbI239 or postdeposition processing of MAPbI340 with CH3NH3I vapor yields uniform
perovskite films with a low grain boundary density, concurrently maintaining
a reasonable processing cost. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to describe the conversion of a PbO2 film into a PbI2 film by HI vapor as well as the reactor
design necessary for such a conversion. PbI2 film fabrication
methods are important because PbI2 films serve as precursors
for several halide perovskites, such as HC(NH2)2PbI3 (FAPbI3)41 and
others.42

Results and Discussion
Film Uniformity
In perovskite solar cells, deviations
from the optimal perovskite film thickness can decrease the performance
either by reducing absorption or by extending the path the charge
carriers need to traverse before collection. In the literature, perovskite
thickness uniformity is typically assessed from SEM images of film
cross sections recorded on a scale of a few micrometers. However,
Liu et al.17 highlighted the disadvantages
of this approach, demonstrating that spin-coated MAPbI3–xClx films that are uniform
on a scale of a few micrometers reveal thickness variations of ±100%
from the mean thickness on a larger scale. Herein, the thickness uniformity
of the films was evaluated by thickness measurements at five distinct
points across every film. Four measurement points were located at
an equal distance from the two nearest deposition area borders, whereas
the fifth one was located in the middle of the deposition area (Figure 1a).

thickness measurement points. (b) Standard

ED of PbO2 Films
Anodic ED of PbO2 proceeds according to reaction 1. 1  The color
of the electrodeposited PbO2 changed from beige to dark
red with increasing film thickness.
The film thickness becomes less uniform with increasing current density
(Figure 1b). Increased
current density causes the reactants to deplete in the vicinity of
the substrate, allowing variations in the diffusion fluxes between
the substrate edges and its center area to affect the uniformity of
the coating.43 In the case of PbO2 deposition, an excessively low current density leads to an impractically
low growth rate. A sufficient growth rate and very uniform PbO2 films are obtained at 0.25 mA
cm–2. In addition, at 0.25 mA cm–2, the current distribution and film uniformity are governed by the
geometry of the bath. Rotating the substrate by 45° with respect
to its normal face-to-face orientation with the counter electrode
alters the thickness profile of the deposited film and produces thinner
PbO2 film in the area further from the counter electrode
(Table 1, compare films
A and B, see also Figure S1). Such a behavior
suggests that proper optimization of the bath geometry can further
improve the film uniformity. Uniformity of the PbO2 film
is important because it is retained through the vapor conversion steps
into the final MAPbI3 film.

a Films A and B deposited at 0.25
mA cm–2 for 200 s. Film A deposited with the substrate
surface parallel and B, with the substrate surface at 45° with
respect to the counter electrode surface. P1 and P4 of film B were
located on the substrate edge closest to the counter electrode. C
was deposited at 0.25 mA cm–2 for 375 s, whereas
D was deposited at 1.8 V for 30 s. Both C and D were deposited with
the substrate surface parallel to the counter electrode surface. A–C
were deposited in a 0.1 M Pb(CH3COO)2, 1.0 M
Na(CH3COO) bath, whereas D was deposited in a 0.1 M Pb(CH3COO)2, 0.2 M NaNO3, 0.1 M HNO3 bath.32 Figures illustrating the thickness
profiles of the films and bath geometries are available in the Supporting
Information (Figures S1 and S2). Positions
of measurement points P1–5 are shown in Figure 1a.

All PbO2 films consist of grains of size 26 ± 11
nm (Figure 2a), which
form larger agglomerates (Figure 2e). These agglomerates expand as the deposition proceeds
and merge to form dense films (Figure 2b,c) with uniform coverage. The roughness of the films
is affected by the size and shape of the agglomerates, for example,
the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of a PbO2 film deposited
for 725 s is 33 nm, which is 18% of the film thickness. Macroscopically,
full coverage is displayed by all of the PbO2 films (Figure 2d,f). However, only
the films deposited for 500 s or longer exhibit full coverage on a
microscopic scale (Figure 2c), whereas in the films deposited for shorter periods, areas
with an exposed FTO surface are observed (Figure 2e). Despite this lack of full coverage in
thinner films, the amount of PbO2 deposited depends linearly
on the deposition time, and the growth rate is 0.25 ± 0.01 nm
s–1 (Figure 1c). In contrast, there is no correlation between deposition
time and thickness nonuniformity. The thickness nonuniformity in the
films is ≤9%.

and
(c) top-view field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images,
and (d) a photograph of a PbO2 film deposited at 0.25 mA
cm–2 for 725 s. (e) FESEM image and (f) a photograph
of a PbO2 film deposited at 0.25 mA cm–2 for 400 s. The outlined area in (e) is the exposed FTO surface.

The as-deposited PbO2 films contain a mixture of orthorhombic
α-PbO2 and tetragonal β-PbO2 phases
(Figure 1d). The ratio
of these phases was impossible to determine due to the broadness of
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) reflections. Therefore, the mean density
(9.71 g cm–3) of the α- and β- phases
(9.87 and 9.55 g cm–3, respectively) was used for
the thickness calculations. XRD reflections appear to broaden due
to the small size of the grains, as observed with AFM and FESEM. According
to the X-ray diffractograms measured with the θ–2θ
geometry, these grains do not exhibit a preferential orientation.

PbO2 films display an optical band gap of 1.4 ±
0.1 eV. This value is in agreement with the values reported previously
for PbO2.44,45 The EDX spectra revealed no impurities,
and all of the films passed the Scotch tape adhesion test without
delaminating. No delamination occurred even in the case of films grown
for 5100 s, whose thickness, estimated from the growth rate (Figure 1c), is 1.3 μm.

In the literature, perovskite films have been made starting from
electrodeposited lead monoxide (PbO) that is converted to PbI2 or directly to MAPbI3.46,47 However, ED of PbO requires unstable H2O2-containing
solutions or additionally dimethyl sulfoxide, elevated temperature,
and solution degassing to remove dissolved O2. In contrast,
PbO2 ED does not require solution degassing and proceeds
under ambient conditions in a stable aqueous solution. The acetate-based
ED solution employed in this study results in a lower growth rate
than that of the nitrate-containing solution used by Chen et al.32 On the other hand, the acetate solution produces
more uniform films (compare films C and D in Table 1, see also Figure S2), and the lower growth rate enables more precise thickness control.
Further comparison of ED-based processes for MAPbI3 films
is provided in Table S1.

Conversion
of PbO2 Films into PbI2
The electrodeposited
PbO2 films were converted into PbI2 films by
exposing them to an excess of HI vapor, which, to
the best of our knowledge, has not been reported elsewhere. The conversion
occurs only at an elevated temperature; therefore, removing the reactor
from the heat source too early will quench the conversion process
and produce partially converted films. The iodine content of a set
of partially converted PbO2 films (Figure S3) and their phase compositions (Figure S4) suggest that for PbO2 films deposited
for 725 s or less, the conversion is completed in 90 min. The use
of a glass reactor (Figure 3a) also allows us to visually observe the progress of the
conversion (see Video S1). The appearance
of the film changes during the conversion, due to changes in the band
gap and roughness, which translate into changes in the reflectance
and transmittance (see Figure S5 for UV–vis
transmittance of as-deposited, partially converted, and fully converted
films). Therefore, an indication of the completion of the conversion
can be obtained from the lack of further changes in the color of the
film. During the conversion, the reaction front advances from the
edges of the PbO2 film toward its center. The reaction
appears to involve PbO2 reduction by iodide (eq 2). The XRD patterns of the partially
converted films (Figure S4) additionally
suggest that this reaction may proceed through the PbI(OH) intermediate
(eqs 3 and 4). 2   3   4  Pb4+ in PbO2 is a hard
Lewis acid and is easily reduced because the inert pair effect makes
the lead +II oxidation state more stable than the +IV oxidation state.
Iodide, a soft Lewis base, in accordance with the Lewis hard–soft
acid–base principle, binds preferably to Pb(II), which is a
soft Lewis acid.

of the PbO2 deposition time and PbO2 film thickness. R2 is 0.996 for the fitted curve on the left-hand-side
graph and 0.995 for the one on the right-hand-side graph.

Initial conversion experiments without silica gel
revealed that
the formed PbI2 film is sensitive to humidity during conversion.
As the conversion proceeds, water droplets may condense on the reactor
walls and substrate. These droplets, upon contact, degrade the formed
PbI2 film. The film appears to dissolve in the droplets.
The droplet condensation ceases when the reactor contains silica gel
granules. The granules absorb moisture originating from the hydroiodic
acid. The amount of hydroiodic acid needs to be optimized for different
PbO2 film thicknesses and reactor volumes (Table 2). Even if reaction 2 liberates water as well, the main concern
is water evaporating from hydroiodic acid. Therefore, if the conversion
was performed with HI gas, silica gel would hardly be needed.

a Thickness estimated
from the growth rate (Figure 1c); the thickest film was converted to PbI2 in
4 h.

X-ray diffractograms
of the converted films lack PbO2 reflections (see Figure S6), whereas
reflections characteristic to crystalline PbI2 emerge (Figure 3b). PbI2 crystallites orient in the films primarily with the (110) planes
parallel to the surface (Figure 3b). Similar orientation is observed in PbI2 films made by converting electrodeposited PbO2 films
in solution; however, (001) planes are predominantly parallel to the
film surface in spin-coated PbI2.32 PbI2 has a two-dimensional layered structure, in which
bonding between the layers is only due to weak interactions. These
layers and interlayer gaps lie perpendicular to the film surface when
(110) planes are parallel to the surface (see Figure S7). Consequently, the interlayer gaps extend through
the film thickness, and in the subsequent conversion step to the perovskite,
they may act as transport paths for the conversion reagent molecules.

PbI2 is less dense (ρ = 6.10 g cm–3) than PbO2 (ρ = 9.6–9.9 g cm–3); therefore, upon conversion, the volume of the PbO2 grains
should expand. In theory, if the grains would expand only perpendicular
to the film surface, the film thickness (d) would
increase by a factor of 3 (eq 5). 5  A similar factor of 3.20 ± 0.10 is obtained
experimentally from the PbI2 versus PbO2 film
thickness plot (Figure 3c). Furthermore, PbI2 film thickness plotted against PbO2 film deposition time reveals that the effective growth rate
of PbI2 films is 0.78 ± 0.02 nm/s. PbI2 films demonstrate relative thickness variations of ≤8% across
the film. This value is correlated with the thickness variations in
PbO2 films, implying that the thickness profile (see films
A and C from Table 1 and Figures S1 and S2) is retained on
conversion. Examination of the PbI2 film morphology reveals
that during the conversion the grains also show slight lateral growth.
The lateral growth explains the pinhole sealing in the PbI2 films converted from the PbO2 films deposited for 400
s (compare Figures 2e and 4a). The lateral growth is favorable
because it compensates for the defects in the PbO2 films
and promotes the formation of dense PbI2 films (Figure 4c). Pinholes still
occur in PbI2 films converted from PbO2 films
deposited for ≤200 s. All PbI2 films appear macroscopically
uniform (Figure 4d),
whereas on a smaller scale, they consist of grains with different
sizes (Figure 4a,b).
The grain size seems to increase with increasing film thickness. For
example, in the PbI2 films converted from PbO2 deposited for 725 s, the grain size is 0.33 ± 0.13 μm.
This grain size is about 10 times larger than that of the original
PbO2 film and can be correlated to the more than doubled
roughness (rms 79 nm) of the converted film. The roughness is, however,
14% of the PbI2 film thickness, suggesting in relative
terms that the surface has leveled a bit. PbI2 films are
yellow, translucent, and display an optical band gap of 2.4 ±
0.1 eV, which agrees with the value previously reported for PbI2.48

Conversion of PbI2 Films into CH3NH3PbI3
The PbI2 films made by
conversion of electrodeposited PbO2 films were finally
converted into MAPbI3 films by exposing them to CH3NH3I vapor. Conversion to MAPbI3 proceeds
in a reactor analogous to the reactor used for the conversion of PbO2 to PbI2 (see Figure S8). Conversion in an inert atmosphere (N2 or Ar) leads
to film deterioration, whereas conversion in static vacuum yields
MAPbI3 films (see Video S2)
as desired. According to EDX, the films contain lead and iodine in
amounts in agreement with the stoichiometry of MAPbI3 (Figure 5a). Furthermore,
the EDX spectra of the films contain nitrogen and carbon signals,
but the limitations of EDX do not allow quantification of these light
elements. No impurity elements were observed in the EDX spectra, and
no PbI2 reflections are observed in the XRD patterns of
the films (see Figure S6 for comparison
of the film diffractograms at different steps). If the conversion
process is interrupted too early, PbI2 reflections are
still observed in the X-ray diffractograms of the partially converted
films (Figure S9). The iodine content in
the films increases linearly with time during the conversion to a
level corresponding to that of MAPbI3 (Figure S10) and remains constant thereafter. Because the thicknesses
of the PbI2 films are known, extrapolating the iodine content
increase to a constant level and assuming that this increase is proportional
to the conversion rate allow us to estimate the latter. The conversion
rate determined with these assumptions is ca. 1.1 μm of the
PbI2 film thickness per hour. The completion of the conversion
of PbI2 to MAPbI3 can also be detected by the
absence of further changes in the appearance of the film. These changes
in the appearance are due to the changes in the optical properties
such as transmittance (Figure S11) of the
film. Recently, Brenner et al. suggested that at elevated temperature
the reaction of PbI2 with CH3NH3I
and the formation of MAPbI3 proceed by a deconstruction–reconstruction
mechanism.49

Figure 5 (a) Pb/(Pb + I) and I/(Pb
+ I) atom percent (atom %) ratios in

for PbI2 films, and the ratios for stoichiometric compounds
(st.) are indicated by dashed lines. (b) Grazing incidence X-ray diffractograms

Both films originate from PbO2 film deposited for 725 s.
The reflections are indexed according to single-crystal data from
Stoumpos et al.50 (c) MAPbI3 film thickness as a function of PbO2 deposition time
and PbI2 film thickness. R2 = 0.998 for fitted curve of both the left- and right-hand-side graphs.

Controlling the duration of the
conversion allows the preparation
of different crystal phases of MAPbI3. MAPbI3 films crystallize in the tetragonal β-phase (Figure 5b) when the conversion lasts
for 2 h. In contrast, if the conversion is continued for 24 h, the
resulting films have a pseudocubic α-phase (Figure 5b). β-MAPbI3 is known to exhibit a phase transition to the α-phase at an
elevated temperature.50 Therefore, prolonged
annealing after the conversion process is complete induces the β-
to α-phase transition, and rapid removal of the reactor from
the heat source prevents the reverse transition and yields α-phase
films. The α-phase is less distorted from the ideal perovskite
structure and is more compact compared with the β-phase. Such
compactness can be beneficial to the stability of the perovskite.
For instance, in the case of MAPbI3–xBrx solid solutions, phase transition
to the pseudocubic phase decreased the moisture sensitivity of the
perovskite.10 For MAPbI3 perovskite,
Milot et al.51 reported that upon temperature
increase and phase transition to the pseudocubic phase the rate constant
for Auger recombination decreases. The Auger recombination rate is
an essential parameter for devices with large charge-carrier densities,
such as lasers and concentrated photovoltaics. Furthermore, photovoltaic
devices with pseudocubic MAPbI3 exhibit less hysteretic
behavior, in contrast to devices with the tetragonal phase.52 For films of either of the phases, XRD measurements
with the θ–2θ geometry revealed no significant
preferential orientation.

There appears to be no limit to the
maximum convertible PbI2 thickness. Even 10 μm thick
MAPbI3 films
(Figure 6a) could be
produced provided that the duration of conversion was long enough
(24 h). One conversion of such thick film was interrupted at 2 h,
and the cross section of this film revealed two distinct layers (Figure 6b). The contrast
difference suggests that the topmost layer is MAPbI3, whereas
the layer underneath is unconverted PbI2. The presence
of PbI2 is also indicated by PbI2 reflections
in the X-ray diffractogram of this film. The interrupted conversion
allows us to evaluate the conversion rate by measuring the geometric
thicknesses of the PbI2 and MAPbI3 layers from
the film cross section. The rate is ca. 1.1 μm/h with respect
to the thickness of the converted PbI2 or 2 μm/h
with respect to the thickness of the formed MAPbI3 film,
in agreement with the rate determined from the change in the iodine
content in the films.

Figure 6 Cross-sectional FESEM images of MAPbI3 films
obtained
by converting PbI2 films for (a) 24 h and (b) 2 h. Both
(a) and (b) samples originate from PbO2 deposited for 5100
s.

MAPbI3 films should
be thicker than the PbI2 and PbO2 films from
which they were prepared because
the MAPbI3 phases are less dense (ρα = 4.09 and ρβ = 4.16 g cm–3) than PbI2 or PbO2. The thickness increase
factor for the β-MAPbI3 films obtained by an approach
similar to the one in eq 1 is 1.97 with respect to that of PbI2 and 6.06 with respect
to that of PbO2. The experimental factors, that is, 1.84
± 0.04 with respect to that of PbI2 (Figure 5c) and 5.84 ± 0.09 with
respect to that of PbO2, agree with the predicted thickness
increase. The MAPbI3 film thickness exhibits a linear dependence
on the deposition time of the original PbO2 film (Figure 5c), and the MAPbI3 growth rate with respect to the PbO2 deposition
time is 1.42 ± 0.03 nm/s. The linear dependence implies that
the MAPbI3 film thickness can be conveniently and accurately
controlled by the PbO2 ED time. The deposition time and
thus the final MAPbI3 thickness have no effect on the uniformity.
The relative thickness nonuniformity of the MAPbI3 films
is 8.5%, a value markedly similar to the nonuniformities of the PbI2 and PbO2 films. The similarity suggests that MAPbI3 inherits its thickness profile from the initial PbO2 film, and this in turn explicitly demonstrates the significance
of the PbO2 uniformity. As discussed previously, the PbO2 film uniformity could be improved by optimizing the ED bath
geometry or alternatively by employing suitable bath additives.

MAPbI3 films are black in color with metal-like reflective
surfaces (Figure 7a,b).
The surface roughness of the β-phase films originating from
the PbO2 films deposited for 725 s is 78 nm (rms), and
these films consist of grains of size 0.30 ± 0.12 μm. This
grain size is similar to that of the preceding PbI2 film
converted from the PbO2 film deposited for 725 s. In contrast
to the β-phase films, the α-phase films originating from
the PbO2 films deposited for 725 s are smoother, with a
surface roughness of 69 nm (rms), and consist of larger grains (size
0.55 ± 0.12 μm). A larger grain size is beneficial for
the efficiency of perovskite-based devices, such as LEDs, TFTs, ReRAMs,
and photovoltaic devices, as it translates to a lower grain boundary
density, improving the charge transfer properties.3,7,22,40,53−55 In addition, a lower grain boundary
density should retard hydration and decomposition of the perovskite
because grain boundaries facilitate transport of water molecules within
the perovskite.56,57The
conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 leveled the films,
similar to the conversion of PbO2 to PbI2; for
instance, the rms roughness is 7% of the film thickness for the β-MAPbI3 film originating from the PbO2 film deposited
for 725 s and 6% for the α-MAPbI3 film originating
from a similar PbO2 film.

to MAPbI3 was 2 h.

Markedly, the voids have been sealed even in the thinnest
MAPbI3 films originating from PbO2 films deposited
for
100 s (Figure 7d).
The tendency for such self-sealing is an advantage of the vapor conversion
method, as it allows some imperfections in the intermediate PbI2 and PbO2 films without compromising the capability
to produce continuous MAPbI3 films, at least in the examined
thickness range (0.1–10 μm).

According to UV–vis
measurements, both α- and β-MAPbI3 films exhibit
an optical band gap of 1.6 ± 0.1 eV. These
values agree with the values previously reported for these MAPbI3 phases.10,50,51 Furthermore, MAPbI3 films behave as photoconductors according
to I–V measurements (Figure S12). A potential difference of 0.9 V
was measured between the FTO bottom contact and the In–Ga eutectic
top contact of the 1.1 μm β-MAPbI3 film when
it was illuminated with 1000 W m–2 as opposed to
zero potential difference measured without illumination. These observations
indicate that the MAPbI3 films made by vapor conversion
of electrodeposited PbO2 are photoactive.

Our preliminary
results indicate that PbI2 films react
also with HC(NH2)2I (formamidinium iodide (FAI))
under the same conditions as their reaction with CH3NH3I. However, the conversion process is much slower with FAI,
and even after 24 h, a minor reflection at 12.4°2θ, indicative
of unreacted PbI2, is observed in the X-ray diffractogram
of the film (Figure S13).

Conclusions
Uniform MAPbI3 films are reproducibly prepared by ED
together with a two-step vapor conversion. Grain growth during the
vapor conversion steps mitigates microscopic voids in the films to
some extent, improving the quality of the final MAPbI3 film.
The crystal phase of the MAPbI3 film as well as its grain
size can be adjusted by changing the duration of the second vapor
conversion step, whereas adjusting the ED duration allows simple control
over the film thickness. A wide range of MAPbI3 film thicknesses,
from tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers, is accessible with
the described approach. ED lacks an inherent substrate size limit
and is scalable in a roll-to-roll or brush manner or to large batches,
whereas vapor exposure steps are in principle limited only by the
reaction vessel size. Together, the qualities of this approach make
it a promising deposition method for a wide range of perovskite film
applications, such as LEDs, TFTs, ReRAM, photodetectors, and photovoltaics.
Future work may focus on further upscaling of the method. Alternatively,
further simplification of the PbO2 to PbI2 conversion
step by exploiting gaseous hydrogen iodide may be explored.

Materials
and Methods
Substrate Preparation
TEC 7 fluorine-doped tin dioxide-coated
glass substrates (FTO) were obtained from SOLEMS. Before ED, the substrates
were rinsed with ethanol, dried with compressed air, and annealed
in an air oven at 350 °C for 2 h. The heating rate was 3 °C/min.

ED of PbO2 Films
An aqueous solution containing
0.10 M lead(II) acetate trihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and 1.00 M
sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) served as an ED bath for PbO2 films.58 The solution was prepared
by first dissolving sodium acetate, followed by initial pH adjustment
to 5.6–5.8. Next, lead(II) acetate trihydrate was dissolved,
followed by final pH adjustment to 5.5. The pH adjustments were done
with 5 M acetic acid and 3 M sodium hydroxide. The solutions were
prepared using 18 MΩ cm resistivity water from a Millipore Milli-Q
system.

ED was performed without stirring at ambient temperature
with an Autolab PGSTAT20 potentiostat–galvanostat and a three-electrode
arrangement. FTO slides (5.0 × 2.5 cm2) acted as working
electrodes, with the active deposition area being 10 cm2 (4.0 × 2.5 cm2). A cylinder-shaped platinum net
(r = 1.5 cm, h = 3.7 cm) was used
as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl/KCl (3 M) electrode as the
reference electrode. EDs were done galvanostatically at a current
density of 0.25 mA cm–2 unless specified otherwise.

Conversion of PbO2 to PbI2
Conversion
of the as-deposited PbO2 to PbI2 was carried
out in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a ground-glass joint (VWR, 29/32).
Hydroiodic acid (20–300 μL, 55%, no stabilizer; Sigma-Aldrich)
was pipetted into a glass boat (l = 5 cm, w = 1 cm), and the boat was transferred into the flask.
A total of 250 mg of silica gel granules (2–6 mm; VWR Chemicals)
was spread around the boat inside the flask to absorb excess water
from the hydroiodic acid. A substrate holder was bent from a titanium
foil (Alfa Aesar, 0.25 mm, 99.5%) and placed over the boat. The PbO2 films were placed onto the holder facing upward. The flask
was then flushed with nitrogen (99.999%) for 2 min and sealed with
a glass stopper. A pinch clamp and high-vacuum silicone grease were
used to ensure hermetic seal. The assembly was heated in either a
stirred oil bath or an air oven and kept at 90 °C for 90 min
unless otherwise specified. After conversion, the PbI2 films
were removed from the still hot flask.

Conversion of PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3
CH3NH3I was synthesized
by adding hydroiodic acid (55%, no stabilizer; Sigma-Aldrich) dropwise
to a methylamine solution (TCI, 40% in methanol) that was stirred
and kept in an ice-bath. Methanol and water were evaporated with a
rotary evaporator, leaving yellow crystals of the raw compound. The
raw compound was recrystallized in ethanol. The resulting white crystals
were separated by filtering, washed with tetrahydrofuran as well as
diethyl ether, and then dried. Dry CH3NH3I was
kept in a N2 glovebox (<0.5 ppm of O2 and
H2O).54

Conversion of
PbI2 to MAPbI3 was carried out in an assembly
similar to the one used for the PbO2 to PbI2 conversion, with stopcock adapter instead of glass stopper. No silica
gel was used, and the boat was loaded with 100 mg of CH3NH3I instead of hydroiodic acid. The flask was evacuated
with a rotary pump to a pressure of 0.9 mbar before heating to 180
°C by means of either a stirred oil bath or an air oven. Unless
otherwise stated, the flask was kept at 180 °C for 2 h. To avoid
CH3NH3I condensation, the MAPbI3 films
were taken out of the flask immediately after the flask was removed
from the hot oil or oven.

Characterization
The morphology
of the films was studied
by FESEM using a Hitachi S-4800 instrument. The composition of the
films was studied by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy with
an Oxford INCA 350 energy spectrometer connected to the FESEM instrument.
The films thicknesses were calculated from the EDX data with GMRFilm
software100 using bulk densities. All of
the reported thicknesses are mean values of five measurements from
distinct positions across the film. The thickness errors are standard
deviations of these five measurements.

AFM images for analyzing
the surface roughness and morphology were recorded using a Veeco Multimode
V AFM with a Nanoscope V controller. The images were captured in the
tapping mode (intermittent contact mode) in air using silicon probes,
with a nominal tip radius of 8 nm and a nominal spring constant of
40 N/m (RTESP from Bruker). Image analysis was performed with Gwyddion
software.59The images were plane-fitted
to remove artifacts caused by sample tilt and scanner bow. Roughness
was calculated as an rms value (or Rq) from 5 × 5 μm2 images for all films. For grain size evaluation, grains were
identified by a watershed algorithm from 5 × 5 μm2 images for PbI2 and MAPbI3 films, whereas
for PbO2 films, 0.5 × 0.5 μm2 images
were used due to the small size of the grains. The grain size was
calculated as the median diameter of circles with areas equivalent
to the area of the identified grains.

The crystallinity of the
film was studied with a PANalytical X’Pert
Pro MPD diffractometer using Cu Kα-radiation. XRD patterns were
measured using both grazing incidence (GIXRD, incident angle 1°)
and θ–2θ geometries. Transmittance measurements
in the UV–vis range were performed with a Hitachi U2000 spectrophotometer.
Optical band gaps were evaluated from the transmittance data and Tauc
plots according to the approach described in the literature.60,61 The band gaps of PbI2 and MAPbI3 were assumed
to be direct-allowed and that of PbO2 indirect-allowed.

I–V measurements were
carried out with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter, using a step width
of 0.05 V and a source step delay of 0.1 s. Electrical contacts were
made by applying Ga–In eutectic alloy (Sigma-Aldrich) dots
(ca. 3 mm2) to FTO and MAPbI3 and contacting
these dots with needle probes. A halogen spot lamp (50 W) was used
for illumination.
