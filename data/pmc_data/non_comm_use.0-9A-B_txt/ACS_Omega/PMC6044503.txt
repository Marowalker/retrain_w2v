Peripheral administration
of PYY3–36, a fragment
of peptide YY (PYY), has been reported to reduce food intake by activating
the neuropeptide Y2 receptor (Y2R). An N-terminally truncated PYY
analogue, benzoyl-[Ala26,Ile28,31]PYY(25–36)
(1), showed a relatively potent agonist activity for
Y2R but a weak anorectic activity by intraperitoneal administration
(2000 nmol/kg) in lean mice because of its markedly poor biological
stability in the mouse serum. Notably, two cyclohexylalanine (Cha)
substitutions for Tyr residues at positions 27 and 36 (4) improved the stability in the mouse serum concomitant with enhanced
anorectic activity. Further optimization at positions 27, 28, 30,
and 31 revealed that 21, containing Cha28 and
Aib31 residues, showed a more potent anorectic activity
than PYY3–36 at a low dose of 300 nmol/kg. The minimum
effective dose by intraperitoneal administration of 21 was 30 nmol/kg (ca. 52 μg/kg) in mice, suggesting the biologic
potential of short-length PYY3–36 analogues with
a potent anorectic effect.

Introduction
Obesity is considered
to comprise an incredibly multifactorial
chronic disease based on both genetic and behavioral factors.1−3 Obesity is commonly associated with various diseases, such as diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular disease, disability,
gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and certain types
of cancer.1 In addition, obesity, which
is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular and all-cause
mortality, has been recognized as a worldwide epidemic.2,4 When considering the treatment of obesity, it is required that the
energy intake is decreased and/or the energy expenditure is increased
to decrease the adipose tissue mass through the generation of a negative
overall energy balance. For this, a restricted diet and exercise therapy
represent the primary options; however, current nutritional guidance
and behavioral approaches have not consistently yielded successful
results. Thus, the establishment of an efficient therapy to treat
metabolic disease and the development of novel effective drugs for
obesity are strongly desired.

Known mechanisms for regulating
food intake and energy metabolism
in the body include anorectic peptides, their receptors, and functional
relationships.5,6 Among these, peptide YY (PYY,
Tyr-Pro-Ile-Lys-Pro-Glu-Ala-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ala-Ser-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asn-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Ala-Ser-Leu-Arg-His-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Leu-Val-Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr-NH2) was originally isolated from the porcine intestine as it
possessed structural identity to neuropeptide Y (NPY) and pancreatic
polypeptide (PP).7,8 These three peptides form the
NPY peptide family, comprising peptides composed of 36 amino acid
residues, a Tyr-rich structure, and a C-terminal amide group. The
homologies of PYY/NPY, PYY/PP, and NPY/PP are 70, 70, and approximately
50%, respectively.9,10

NPY family receptors including
six subtypes (Y1–Y5 and y6)
are recognized in mammals. However, the functionality of Y3 remains
controversial,11−13 and the gene for y6 is not expressed in primates.14−16 Therefore, most pharmacological studies of the NPY family receptors
have focused on Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5, clarifying their different distributions
and ligand affinities.8,17−19 PYY is produced
and secreted from L-cells in the intestinal epithelium of the ileum
and colon. PYY has two endogenous isoforms: PYY1–36 and its N-terminally truncated form, PYY3–36,
which constitutes the main isoform in circulation. The N-terminal
dipeptide (Tyr-Pro) of PYY1–36 is considered to
be cleaved by a plasma protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV.20 PYY1–36 binds to all Y family
receptors with comparable affinity of a similar magnitude; conversely,
PYY3–36 displays increased Y2 receptor (Y2R) affinity
and decreased Y1R and Y5R affinity.21,22 Notably, PYY3–36 has been reported to show anorectic activity by
central and peripheral administration in mice.23 The anorectic effect was not observed in Y2R KO mice, indicating
that the effect was mediated by Y2R activation.24 In initial clinical trials, approximately 30% of energy
intake was suppressed after continuous intravenous infusion of PYY3–36;25 in addition, an anorectic
effect of PYY3–36 was also found in subsequent clinical
trials.26,27

Considering that PYY3–36 possesses a weak agonist
activity for Y1R and Y4R,22 we were interested
in determining the anorectic potential of PYY analogues with potent
Y2R agonist activity and higher selectivity for Y2R over Y1R and Y4R.
The selectivity of PYY analogues for Y2R has been shown to be increased
by N-terminal truncation;28 in addition,
amino acid substitutions at positions 32 and 34 in the NPY analogues
affect the selectivity for Y1R and Y4R.29,30 Among the
reported peptides, 12-amino acid peptides containing the N-terminal
benzoyl group showed potent Y2R agonist activity and strict selectivity
for Y2R over Y1R and Y5R.31 Specifically,
a series of N-terminally substituted benzoylated PYY analogues with
12 amino acids possessed high agonist activities with EC50 values in the nM range for Y2R and selectivity over Y1R and Y5R,
for example, benzoyl (6 nM) and 4-aminobenzoyl (3 nM).31 A variety of PYY analogues with amino acid substitutions,
such as Ala26 or Ile28,31, were also disclosed
to have Y2R agonism.32 Furthermore, PEGylation
of the N-terminus of the short-length peptides maintained the selectivity
for Y2R and elicited food intake and body weight reduction as well
as improved glucose metabolism in rodents.33−35 However, few
studies have used the in vivo activity of short-length peptides without
the modification with PEG, albumin, or long-chain alkyl groups. We
therefore designed and synthesized a new class of short-length PYY
analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles as well as potent
Y2R agonist activity, and demonstrated their anorectic activity in
mice.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
All peptides were synthesized
using standard
Fmoc-based solid-phase synthetic methods. Subsequent preparative high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification of the obtained crude peptides
exhibited ≥95% homogeneity. The purity of each peptide was
verified by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), and the structure
was assigned using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS).

Biological Activities
The binding affinity and agonist
activity of all peptides synthesized were examined by receptor and
[35S]GTPγS binding assays using Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells expressing human cloned Y2R. Peptides with potent agonist
activity were then screened for their anorectic activity in mice by
intraperitoneal (ip) administration (250, 500, 1000, or 2000 nmol/kg).
Results of in vitro and in vivo screening are shown in Table 1.

Design and
Syntheses of Dodecapeptide PYY Analogues Substituted
at Positions 27 and 36
A short-length analogue of PYY3–36 with a simple benzoyl group at the N-terminus,
benzoyl-[Ala26,Ile28,31]PYY(25–36) (1), showed relatively high affinity and potent agonist activity
for Y2R. Although 1 comprised the short-length peptide
without any modification, for example, PEG or a long-chain alkyl, 1 showed moderate anorectic activity by ip administration
at a high dose of 2000 nmol/kg in lean mice. Generally, short-length
peptides tend to be quickly inactivated by proteases in the serum;
therefore, we examined the serum stability of 1. Upon
incubation in 20% mouse serum/PBS for 30 min, the residual ratio of
the original peptide (1) was 5%. This result indicated
the possibility that improvement of the serum stability might provide
short-length peptides with a robust anorectic activity. To examine
the effect of the substitution for a Tyr residue, which is a target
of chymotrypsin-like proteases, on the serum stability, the unnatural
amino acid, Cha, was introduced into positions 27 or 36. Compounds 2 (Cha36) and 3 (Cha27)
showed good profiles of binding affinity and agonist activity for
Y2R, as did 1. The serum stability of both 2 and 3 was increased with residual ratio values of 53
and 10%, respectively, indicating the increase in protease resistance
effected by the substitution of Cha for Tyr. In addition, the combined
Cha substitution at positions 27 and 36 (4) achieved
further improvement of serum stability; in particular, 4 did not yield any apparent metabolites within 30 min in 20% mouse
serum/PBS. Consistent with the enhanced stability afforded by the
double-Cha substitution, 4 exerted an anorectic activity
at a lower dose of 1000 nmol/kg but only minimally affected in vitro
agonist activities.

Design and Syntheses of Dodecapeptide PYY
Analogues Substituted
at Position 30 or 31
Further improvement of anorectic activity
was investigated by generating amino acid substitutions at positions
30 and 31, which were found to be replaceable without loss of agonist
activity for Y2R in our studies (data not shown). Specifically, aromatic
amino acid substitutions at position 30, such as Trp (5) or Phe(4F) (6), induced comparable or slightly stronger
food intake inhibition than 4, whereas the binding affinities
and agonist activities of 5 and 6 were moderate.
The results imply that these hydrophobic residue substitutions improved
the pharmacokinetic profiles of the peptides.

Substitutions
of unnatural amino acids Nle31 (7) and Cha31 (8) decreased the binding affinity several-fold
compared with 4; however, 8 showed slightly
improved anorectic activity. In addition, a Lys analogue (9) displayed more than 4-fold increase in the agonist activity compared
to that of 4 but no remarkable anorectic activity, which
was likely caused by its decreased serum stability. The introduction
of an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, 2-aminoisobutyric
acid (Aib), into position 31 (10), which was expected
to improve serum stability, increased both agonist activity and anorectic
activity. Furthermore, the Aib31 residue, which is known
to enhance peptide helicity, may have contributed to inducing a preferable
conformation for Y2R recognition and to the resistance against serum
proteases.

Comparison of the Biological Activities of
Peptide Analogues
with the Combination of Amino Acid Substitutions at Positions 30 and
31
Substitution of Trp30 (5), Lys31 (9), or Aib31 (10)
contributed to the increase in in vitro or in vivo activity, which
allowed us to synthesize analogues with combined substitutions at
positions 30 and 31. The Trp30-Aib31 analogue
(11) showed a moderate anorectic activity comparable
to the parent compounds (5, 10). Compound 12 containing Trp30 and Lys31 substitutions,
each of which individually showed increased in vivo or in vitro activity,
exhibited potent in vitro activities; however, it was not taken into
consideration for further studies of Lys31 derivatives
owing to its weak anorectic activity. Among the analogues composed
of amino acids at positions 30 (Leu or Trp) and 31 (Ile, Lys, or Aib),
Leu30-Ile31 (4), Trp30-Ile31 (5), Leu30-Aib31 (10), and Trp30-Aib31 (11) showed similar anorectic activities at 1000 nmol/kg, which
was more potent than that shown by the lead compound, 1, at 2000 nmol/kg, concomitant with their enhanced metabolic stability
(4, 5, 10, 11)
in 20% mouse serum/PBS compared to that in 1. Cha substitutions
at positions 27 and 36 (4) were crucial for stability
in the mouse serum, and additional substitutions, that is, Trp30 (5), Aib31 (10), and
their combination, Trp30-Aib31 (11), allowed the maintenance of high stability. Compounds 4, 5, 10, and 11 were comparable
to or more stable than PYY3–36 in 20% mouse serum/PBS; 4, 5, 10, and 11 showed,
however, lower anorectic activities than that shown by PYY3–36 at 1000 nmol/kg in lean mice; therefore, the subsequent optimization
of 5, 10, and 11 was performed
in terms of the anorectic activity in lean mice.

Design and
Syntheses of Trp30-Ile31 Derivatives
Substituted at the N-Terminus and at Positions 27 and 28
Further improvement of the anorectic activity of PYY analogues was
examined by substitution at the N-terminus and at positions 27 and
28. For N-terminus substitutions, a cyclohexylcarbonyl analogue (13) of the Trp30-Ile31 derivatives showed
similar in vitro activity and anorectic activity as the parent compound
(5), indicating that an aromatic moiety of the N-terminus
of dodecapeptide derivatives is not necessary for binding to Y2R.
Although Cha introduction (14) at position 28 of 13 had some effect on the improvement of the anorectic activity,
the binding affinity and agonist activity for Y2R were decreased.
The 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine [Nal(2)]27 analogue (15) also possessed moderate anorectic activity but showed decreased
in vitro activities.

Design and Syntheses of Leu30-Aib31 and
Trp30-Aib31 Derivatives Substituted at the N-Terminus
and at Positions 27, 28, and 30
The N-terminal substitution
of the Leu30-Aib31 analogue (10) with a cyclohexylcarbonyl moiety (16) showed no increase
in either in vitro or in vivo activities. The cyclohexylcarbonyl analogue
(17) of 11 composed of Trp30-Aib31 possessed a moderately improved anorectic activity compared
to that of 11. Among the Leu30-Aib31 derivatives substituted at position 28 (18–21), the Trp28 analogue (18) possessed
relatively potent in vitro activities comparable to those of 10 but did not reduce the food intake at a dose of 500 nmol/kg
in mice. Conversely, the replacement of an unnatural amino acid, 3-(1-naphthyl)alanine
[Nal(1)] (19), Nal(2) (20), or Cha (21), at position 28 improved the anorectic activity at the
dose of 500 nmol/kg. In particular, 21 showed the most
robust activity at 49% food intake reduction. Even at a dose of 250
nmol/kg, an apparent anorectic effect of 21 was observed
with a more potent activity than that of PYY3–36. When comparing the effect of replacing the N-terminal moiety (21–26), a benzoyl group (21) was preferable in terms of in vitro and in vivo activities. Although
the introduction of a basic moiety at the N-terminus (24) increased the binding affinity and agonist activity for Y2R, 24 did not show increased anorectic activity compared with 21. A bulky hydrophobic moiety, such as 1-naphthoyl or 2-naphthoyl
groups (25, 26), was not effective in increasing
the binding affinity and agonist activity of the analogues for Y2R.
Several preferable amino acid substitutions found in this study, for
example, Trp30 (5), Phe(4F)30 (6), and Nal(2)27 (15), were also introduced
into the basic structure of 22 containing a cyclohexanoyl
moiety; however, these substitutions (27–29) did not lead to improved results in terms of food intake
suppression.

Anorectic Activity of PYY3–36, 1, and 21 in Lean Mice
The anorectic
activity
of PYY3–36, 1, and 21 was
evaluated by bolus ip administration in lean mice (Table 2, Figure 1). PYY3–36 and 21 significantly reduced food intake 3 and 6 h after dosing in a dose-dependent
manner with a minimum effective dose of 30 nmol/kg (ca. 52 μg/kg)
(Table 2, Figure 1A), whereas weak
anorectic activity of the lead compound, 1, with low
serum stability was observed at a higher dose of 2000 nmol/kg (Table 1, Figure 1B). Compound 21 thus represented a new short-length peptide that showed potent anorectic
activity comparable to that of PYY3–36.

Pharmacokinetic Parameters of 21 in Mice
The pharmacokinetic parameters of 21 were examined in
lean mice. Compound 21 was injected intravenously (iv)
and ip at 1 mg/kg (Table 3). The total body clearance (CLtotal) of 21 after iv administration was 162 mL/h/kg, indicating relatively
low clearance compared to that of PYY3–36 (914 mL/h/kg)
(Table S2). Compound 21 possessed
lower tissue distribution than that of PYY3–36 (328
mL/kg) with a volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) of 73 mL/kg. The pharmacokinetic properties of 21 were
considered to be good in the blood circulation for such a short-length
peptide and contributed the potent anorectic activity in mice, although
the binding affinity and agonist activity of 21 were
more than 10-fold lower than those of PYY3–36. The
bioavailability (BA) value of 21 was 6.8 after ip dosing,
indicating slow transfer into the blood vessels and the circulation.
Thus, the possibility remains to obtain more potent analogues by increasing
the absorption rate or improving the biological stability in peripheral
tissues.

Conclusions
We
designed and synthesized short-length PYY3–36 analogues
with 12 amino acid residues. A lead compound, benzoyl-[Ala26,Ile28,31]PYY(25–36) (1),
showed a moderate anorectic activity at a dose of 2000 nmol/kg in
lean mice by ip administration. However, 1 showed low
biological stability in the mouse serum. The substitution of an unnatural
amino acid residue, Cha, at position 27 (2), 36 (3), or at both positions (4) of 1, improved the serum stability; notably, 4 was completely
resistant to serum proteases under the condition of 20% mouse serum/PBS
for 30 min. Furthermore, a bolus ip administration of 4 showed marked anorectic activity at a dose of 1000 nmol/kg in mice.
A subsequent investigation of the N-terminal modifications and amino
acid substitutions at positions 27, 28, 30, and 31 led to the potent
analogue (21) containing Cha28 and Aib31 residues. Compound 21, which exhibited a Y2R
agonist activity comparable to that of 1, reduced food
intake more potently than PYY3–36 at 300 nmol/kg
in mice. Furthermore, ip-administered 21 inhibited food
intake in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum effective dose of
30 nmol/kg (ca. 52 μg/kg). Thus, the results of this study suggest
that short-length PYY3–36 analogues without modification
with PEG, albumin, or long-chain alkyl groups show potential as a
new option of compounds with potent anorectic activity and an antiobesity
effect.

Experimental Section
Instruments and Materials
Manual
Fmoc solid-phase peptide
syntheses were conducted, which consisted of Fmoc cleavage with 20%
piperidine/N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) (20 min) and an Fmoc amino acid condensation reaction using N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPCDI)/1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole
(HOAt) (4 equiv), or by the ABI 433A automated peptide synthesizer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) [as per the Fmoc/DCC/N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) 0.25 mmol protocol]. All final
compounds were purified to ≥95% homogeneity by the RP-HPLC
analysis with a photodiode array detector across a wavelength range
of 190–500 nm; the absence of co-eluting impurities (heterogeneous
peaks) was confirmed by the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC/MS) analysis. The identity of the peptides was confirmed by the
MALDI-TOF-MS analysis on a Bruker autoflex speed system (Billerica,
MA). The purity, retention time, and molecular weight of each peptide
are summarized in Table S1 of the Supporting
Information. Commercially available amino acid derivatives and resins
were purchased from Novabiochem (Billerica, MA), Watanabe Chemical
Industries (Hiroshima, Japan), Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), Bachem
(Bubendorf, Switzerland), AnaSpec (Fremont, CA), Chem-Impex International
(Wood Dale, IL), and American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA), whereas
other reagents, such as coupling and deprotection reagents, were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), Novabiochem, Watanabe
Chemical Industries, and Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan).

General Procedure
for Synthesis of PYY Analogues
All
peptides were synthesized in the same manner as the following synthesis
procedure for benzoyl-[Cha27,28,36,Aib31]PYY(25–36)
(21). Using commercially available Sieber Amide resin
(347 mg, 0.25 mmol) as a starting material and an ABI433A peptide
synthesizer (DCC/HOBt 0.25 mmol protocol), amino acids were successively
condensed to give H-Arg(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl,
Pbf)-His(triphenylmethyl, Trt)-Cha-Cha-Asn(Trt)-Leu-Aib-Thr(tert-butyl, tBu)-Arg(Pbf)-Gln(Trt)-Arg(Pbf)-Cha-Sieber
Amide Resin (1.1292 g, 0.232 mmol/g). Then, 431.0 mg (0.1 mmol) of
the obtained resin was weighed, washed with DMF, and after swelling,
treated with benzoic acid (48.8 mg, 0.4 mmol), DIPCDI (63.6 μL,
0.4 mmol), and 0.5 M HOAt/DMF (0.8 mL, 0.4 mmol) in DMF for 90 min
to benzoylate the N-terminus. The resin was washed with DMF and methanol
and then dried to give benzoyl-Arg(Pbf)-His(Trt)-Cha-Cha-Asn(Trt)-Leu-Aib-Thr(tBu)-Arg(Pbf)-Gln(Trt)-Arg(Pbf)-Cha-Sieber Amide Resin (452.0
mg, 0.1 mmol). Next, TFA/thioanisole/m-cresol/H2O/1,2-ethanedithiol/triisopropylsilane (80:5:5:5:2.5:2.5)
(3 mL) was added to the entire amount of the obtained resin, and the
mixture was stirred at an ambient temperature for 90 min, after which
diethyl ether was added to the reaction solution to allow precipitation
of a white powder. An operation to remove the ether by decantation
after centrifugation of the suspension was repeated twice to remove
the acid and scavenger material. The residue was extracted with an
aqueous acetic acid solution and purified by preparative HPLC using
Daisopak-SP100-5-ODS-P (20 × 250 mm I.D.) (OSAKA SODA, Osaka,
Japan) to give 84.1 mg of a white powder; mass spectrum: MALDI-TOF
(α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid, monoisotopic) [M + H]+ 1727.92 (Calcd 1728.05). Elution time on RP-HPLC: 8.19 min.
Elution conditions: Phenomenex Kinetex 1.7 μm XB-C18 column
(100 × 2.1 mm I.D.) (Torrance, CA), linear density gradient elution
with eluents A/B = 95/5–45/55 (10 min), using 0.1% TFA in water
as eluent A and 0.1% TFA-containing acetonitrile as eluent B; flow
rate: 0.5 mL/min.

Establishment of Cloned Human Y2R-Expressing
CHO Cells
The entire coding region of the human NPY2R cDNA
was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human brain
cDNA (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan). The DNA sequence of the PCR product
was confirmed to represent human Y2R and finally cloned into expression
vector pAKKO-111H for the expression of Y2R in CHO cells. This expression
vector was transfected into CHO (dhfr-) cells, and
CHO cells stably expressing human Y2R were established as described
previously.36

Membrane Preparation from
CHO Cells Expressing Human Y2R
The affinity of the synthesized
peptides for human Y2R was determined
by a competitive binding experiment with membranes of CHO cells expressing
cloned human Y2R. The membrane was prepared as described previously.36 The CHO cells were detached from the culture
dish with PBS–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The cells
were recovered by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The cell
pellets obtained were homogenized in ice-cold homogenizing buffer
[10 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), 10 μg/mL pepstatin A, 20 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL
E-64] with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland).
The homogenate was centrifuged at 700g for 15 min
at 4 °C, and then the supernatant obtained was ultracentrifuged
at 10 000g for 60 min. The resultant pellet
was suspended in a suspending buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM PMSF, 10 μg/mL pepstatin A, 20 μg/mL
leupeptin, 10 μg/mL E-64, 0.03% NaN3, pH 7.4). The
protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein
Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Receptor Binding
Assay for Human Y2R
First, 2 μL
of the test compound was incubated in a 96-well plate with 100 μL
of the membrane diluted with the assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.03% NaN3, pH 7.4) to 0.5 μg
protein/mL and 100 μL of 400 pM 125I-PYY (NEX341;
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). After incubation at room temperature for
60 min, the reaction mixture was filtered through a UniFilter-96 GF/C
(PerkinElmer) presoaked in a polyethylenimine (PEI) solution (20 mM
Tris, 0.3% PEI, pH 7.4). The filter was washed three times with the
ice-cold filtration buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 150
mM NaCl, 0.03% NaN3, 0.05% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate,
pH 7.4). The UniFilter-96 GF/C was then dried; 15 μL of the
liquid scintillator MicroScint O (PerkinElmer) was then added to each
well, and the radioactivity was measured using TopCount (PerkinElmer).
The data obtained were analyzed using Prism (GraphPad Software, La
Jolla, CA) to calculate the IC50 value.

[35S]GTPγS Binding Assay
The agonist
activity of the compounds for human Y2R was evaluated using a [35S]GTPγS binding assay. First, 2 μL of the test
compound was incubated in a 96-well plate with 100 μL of the
membrane diluted with the assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 μL GDP, 0.03% NaN3, 0.1%
bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to 1 μg protein/mL and 100 μL
of 1 nM [35S]GTPγS (NEG030H, PerkinElmer). After
incubation at room temperature for 120 min, the reaction mixture was
filtered through a UniFilter-96 GF/C, washed, and dried, and the radioactivity
was measured as done for the receptor binding assay. The data obtained
were analyzed using Prism to calculate the EC50 value.

Food Intake Assay
Male C57BL/6J mice (seven-week-old)
were purchased from Charles River (Kanagawa, Japan). The mice were
housed in a room at 22 °C in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and
maintained on a standard chow diet. Before the administration of peptides,
the mice were acclimated by daily handling for 5 days. They were then
acclimated daily to ip injection by sham injection with a 29-gauge
needle for 3 days. They were fasted for 16 h with water available
during the dark cycle and then were ip injected with peptides. Preweighed
chow was provided, and the food intake was measured at 3, 6, and 24
h post injection.

Pharmacokinetics of PYY Analogues in Mice
Peptides
were administered iv or ip to the C57BL/6J mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg
in fed animals. After administration, blood samples were collected
at 5, 10, 15, 30 min, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 24 h and centrifuged to obtain
the plasma fraction. The plasma samples were deproteinized with acetonitrile,
followed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were analyzed by
LC/MC/MS to determine the plasma concentration of the peptides. The
pharmacokinetics parameters were calculated by the moment analysis
method. The plasma concentration 5 min after injection (C5 min), the area under the concentration–time
curve from time zero to 24 h (AUC0–24 h), the
mean residence time (MRT), Vdss, and CLtotal for each mouse after iv administration were obtained. The maximum
plasma concentration (Cmax), time to maximum
plasma concentration (Tmax), AUC0–24 h, MRT, and BA for each mouse after ip administration were also obtained.
