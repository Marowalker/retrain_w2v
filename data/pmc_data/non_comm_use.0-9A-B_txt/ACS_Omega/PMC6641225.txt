Stereoselective total
syntheses of pinguisane type of sesquiterpenoids
are described following a unified approach using a chiral building
block derived from (R)-pulegone. The functionality
embodied in the key intermediate enables their facile elaboration
into more complex structures of biological relevance such as acutifolone
A (9 steps, 22% overall yield) and bisacutifolone A and B (6 and 8%,
respectively) following Furukawa’s modified Simmons–Smith
cyclopropanation, Luche reduction, Saegusa–Ito oxidation, pyridinium
chlorochromate-mediated 1,3-oxidative transposition, and Diels–Alder
dimerization as key steps.

==== Body
Introduction
Liverworts are nonvascular
land plants usually regarded as bryophytes
along with mosses and hornworts. The bryophytes are taxonomically
placed between algae and pteridophytes with approximately 18 000
species or more worldwide. The liverworts contain oil bodies that
are easily extracted with organic solvents, whereas the other two
classes do not contain oil bodies. The Porella species of liverworts produces a variety of terpenoids, and a few
notable classes of compounds that are isolated from these plants are
the pinguisanes, chamigranes, longifolenes, and caryophylanes.1 These liverworts show a broad range of interesting
biological activities including anticancer,2 antifeedant,3 antimicrobial,4 and allergenic contact dermatitis activities.5 Many sesquiterpenoids that embody an unusual
[4.3.0]nonane system with four contiguous chiral centers oriented
in an all-cis fashion such as pinguisenol (2), naviculol
(3), isonaviculol (4), acutifolone A and
B (5, 6), and bisacutifolone A and B (7, 8) have been isolated from various liverworts
by Asakawa and co-workers (Figure 1).6 Interesting structural
features, namely two vicinal quaternary carbon atoms and four cis
methyl groups on contiguous carbon atoms, in concurrence with interesting
biological activities have made pinguisanes an attractive and challenging
synthetic target for synthetic organic chemists (Figure 2).

examples for pinguisane sesquiterpenes isolated
from porella liverworts.

Figure 2 Synthetic approaches for acutifolone A (5).

In this aspect, four synthetic
approaches for pinguisenol (2)7,8a have
been reported employing propargylsilane-terminated
cyclization, ortho ester Claisen rearrangement, diazo ketone cyclopropanation,
and α-carbonyl radical cyclization as key steps. Recently, our
group has reported8a the synthesis of 2 starting from Hajos–Parrish type ketone using stereoselective
cyclopropanation and diastereoselective hydrogenation using the ThalesNano
H-Cube Pro flow reactor as key reactions. Similarly, acutifolone A
(5) has been synthesized by two groups9 in the racemic form; the first synthesis was reported by
Nishiyama et al., following Mukayama aldol reaction as the key step;
the latter was by Shia and co-workers employing Pd-mediated methylenecyclopentane
annulation reaction. Although various synthetic approaches are available
for pinguisanes, there is only one common approach for both pinguisenol
and acutifolone A in the racemic form, following a sequence of 16
and 25 synthetic operations, respectively. As a continuation of our
work on the synthesis of terpenoids,8 herein,
we have disclosed a concise and unified stereoselective strategy for
the total synthesis of pinguisenol (2), isonaviculol
(4), acutifolone A (5), and bisacutifolone
A and B (7, 8).

Results and Discussions
The retrosynthetic analysis for the pinguisanes is depicted in Scheme 1. The synthesis of
acutifolone A 5 could be derived from intermediate 12 via alkynylation and pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)-mediated
1,3-oxidative transposition. Intermediate 12 could be
synthesized following a regioselective cyclopropane ring opening reaction
starting from 14 as the key transformation. Cyclopropane
alcohol 14 could be accessed from enone–ester 11 via Luche reduction and a modified Simmons–Smith
cyclopropanation reaction. The chiral enone ester building block 11 can be easily prepared on the gram scale from (R)-pulegone 16 following a known protocol.10 On similar lines, isonaviculol 4 and pinguisenol 2 could be synthesized from cyclopropane
compound 17 following our previous report.8a Intermediate 17 in turn could be
obtained from 15 via cyclopropane alcohol intermediate 13 by employing functional groups interconversion.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic
Analysis
The synthesis began
with the gram scale preparation of bicyclic
chiral building block 15, utilizing (R)-pulegone 16 as the starting material, following a
known synthetic method,10 that is, bromination,
Favorskii rearrangement, ozonolysis, Michael addition, or intramolecular
Aldol condensation. The enone carbonyl of 15 was reduced
under Luche conditions11 using CeCl3·7H2O and NaBH4 to afford allylic
alcohol 18 as a single diastereomer. The diastereoselectivity
in the formation of 18 can be rationalized from the preferential
attack of the hydride ion from the less hindered α-face because
the β-face is sterically crowded by the presence of CO2Me and Me groups (Scheme 2). The olefinic bond of 18 was subjected to hydroxy-directed
cyclopropanation using Furukawa’s modified Simmons–Smith
reaction conditions12 to furnish cyclopropyl
alcohol 13 as a single isomer. The secondary alcohol
of 13 was oxidized under Dess–Martin periodinane
conditions to afford keto compound 19 in good yield,
which on reduction with Li–liq. NH313 provided the desired cyclopropane ring opened product 20 in <10% yield (Scheme 2), along with an intractable mixture of compounds (might
be due to the formation of over reduced side products related to ester
and keto functionality of 19).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 15 and Further Elaboration to 20
To circumvent the steric hindrance problem associated
with the
cyclopropane reduction, the methyl group at the C-4 position was replaced
with H in compound 15 (Scheme 2). Accordingly, compound 11 was
prepared in gram quantity following the known protocol starting from
(R)-pulegone 16.10 Enone 11 was reduced under Luche conditions,
which occurred stereoselectively to deliver allylic alcohol 21 as a single diastereomer.

Cyclopropanation of 21 under Furukawa’s modified
Simmons–Smith reaction conditions afforded compound 14 as a single isomer in good yield. The secondary hydroxyl group was
converted to keto compound 22 under Dess–Martin
periodinane oxidation conditions. The relative stereochemistry of
the cyclopropane ring was ascertained from the single-crystal X-ray
diffraction analysisa of 22 (Scheme 3). Pleasingly, treatment
of cyclopropane compound 22 with lithium in liquid ammonia
produced the desired quaternary methyl compound 23 in
good yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Building Block 11 and Further Elaboration
to 23
Compound 23 was converted to α,β-unsaturated
compound 24 under Saegusa–Ito oxidation conditions14 via the formation of silyl-enol ether and Pd-catalyzed
dehydrosilylation reactions. To check the feasibility of 1,3-oxidative
transposition reaction, we proceeded further without introducing the
Me group at the C-4 position of compound 24. Accordingly,
enone 24 was treated with vinyl magnesium bromide to
furnish compound 25. Because intermediate 25 embodies two double bonds, one internal and other external (Scheme 4), the assumption
was the formation of two different products 26 and 27 during the PCC-mediated 1,3-oxidative transposition reaction.15,16 However, when we performed the reaction of 25 with
PCC and pyridinium dichromate under various conditions, the oxidative
transposition reaction occurred exclusively with the external olefin
and produced the conjugated aldehyde 26 as a 2:1 mixture
of E/Z isomers (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Enone 24 and Study of PCC-Reaction
To resolve this problem, acetylide generated from trimethylsilane
(TMS)-acetylene was added to enone 24, instead of vinyl
magnesium bromide, and the resultant TMS-alkyne addition compound
was obtained in good yield. The TMS-protected propargyl alcohol derivative
was treated with PCC, and the resultant yield of enone alkyne 28 produced was as per our expectation.17 The TMS group of 28 was deprotected using
K2CO3 in methanol to afford terminal alkyne 29; further reduction of alkyne to alkene under Lindlar’s
hydrogenation conditions18 produced the
desired dieneone compound 27, which is C-4 desmethyl-acutifolone
A (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis
of C-4-desmethyl Acutifolone 27
To synthesize acutifolone A, it was necessary to have
a preinstalled
methyl group at the C-4 position. Accordingly, the methyl group in
compound 24 was introduced using lithium diisopropylamide
and methyl iodide (MeI) to afford compound 12 as a single
diastereomer. The relative stereochemistry of the methyl center at
C-4 was found to be syn with respect to the adjacent Me group at C-9
via NOESY study (Supporting Information). Further, this substrate upon treatment with TMS-acetylide afforded
the alkyne addition compound, which was subjected to PCC-mediated
oxidative transposition to deliver TMS-acetylide incorporated enone 30. The TMS protection group was removed using K2CO3 in methanol to afford terminal alkyne 31, which on treatment with Lindlar’s catalyst provided the
natural product, acutifolone A, 5 in 95% yield (Scheme 6). The spectral and
analytical data, including the specific rotation of the synthesized
compound, were identical with that of the reported isolation6d and synthetic values.9

Scheme 6 Synthesis of Natural Product Acutifolone
(5)
After the successful achievement of the stereoselective
synthesis
of acutifolone A 5, biomimetic Diels–Alder dimerization
of 5 using previously reported conditions by Nishiyama
and co-workers9b led us to deploy the same
for the synthesis of bisacutifolone A 7 and B 8 using butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in toluene as an oxidizing
agent at 125 °C in a sealed tube (Scheme 7). As per the earlier
report, Diels–Alder adduct forms first, which then undergoes
double-bond migration and oxidation19 to
afford dimers 7 and 8 in addition to the
overoxidized compound 32. The spectral data [1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] and specific
rotation was analogous to that of the reported values.6d,9b

Scheme 7 Diels–Alder Dimerization of Acutifolone 5
Finally, to demonstrate the
application of the synthetic strategy
developed by us, synthesis of pinguisenol and isonaviculol was initiated,
taking precursor 15 as the starting material (Scheme 8). Accordingly, the
secondary hydroxy group present in 15 was protected as
its tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) ether, using
TBDPSCl and imidazole followed by reduction of the ester group with
diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) to afford primary alcohol 34 in 87% yield. The primary alcohol group was protected as
its tosylate using tosyl chloride and triethylamine in the presence
of a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The tosylate
was then treated with LiAlH4 to furnish methyl derivative 17 in 55% yield over two steps (Scheme 8).20 From compound 17, the synthesis of pinguisenol and isonaviculol was achieved
following our reported transformations.8a Additionally, we also made C-6 ester analogue 35 of
pinguisenol from compound 12 by following hydrogenation
and vinylation reactions.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully achieved the first enantioselective
synthesis of acutifolone A and bisacutifolone A and B in a concise
manner with a good overall yield, starting from a common chiral building
block derived from (R)-pulegone. The versatility
of the developed strategy was also demonstrated by the synthesis of
pinguisenol and isonaviculol. The key reactions employed in the synthesis
are Luche reduction, Furukawa’s modified Simmons–Smith
cyclopropanation, cyclopropane ring opening with Li–liq. NH3, Saegusa–Ito oxidation, PCC-mediated 1,3-oxidative
transposition reaction, and Diels–Alder dimerization reaction.

stirred solution of primary alcohol 34 (250 mg, 0.58
mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL), TsCl (220 mg, 1.16
mmol), Et3N (0.24 mL, 1.74 mmol), and DMAP (14.2 mg, 0.12
mmol) were sequentially added at 0 °C, and the reaction mixture
was allowed to warm to 25 °C and stirred for 24 h. After completion
of the reaction (monitored by TLC), it was quenched with saturated
aq NH4Cl solution (10 mL) and diluted CH2Cl2 (10 mL). The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous
layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 15
mL); the combined organic extract was dried over Na2SO4 and removed under reduced pressure. The crude compound was
used directly for the next reaction.

To a stirred solution of
LiAlH4 (44 mg, 1.16 mmol) in THF (2 mL), tosyl compound
(300 mg) in THF (2 mL) was added dropwise at room temperature. Then,
the reaction mixture was warmed to 50 °C and stirred for 12 h.
After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), it was quenched
with saturated aq Na2SO4 solution (2 mL) and
was further stirred for 1 h. The resulting mixture was filtered through
a small bed of Celite and washed thoroughly with EtOAc (10 mL). The
solvents were removed under reduced pressure, and the obtained crude
compound was purified by silica gel column chromatography (100% hexane)
