Development of nanozymes, which are
nanomaterials with intrinsic
enzymatic properties, has emerged as an appealing alternative to the
natural enzymes with tremendous application potential from the chemical
industry to biomedicine. The self-assembled growth of micrometer-sized
oxide materials with controlled nonspherical shapes can be an important
tool for enhancing activity as artificial enzymes, as the formation
of these superstructures often results in high surface area with favorable
impact on catalytic activity. Herein, the growth of rod-shaped Fe3O4 microstructures via a one-pot microwave-based
method and using a water–poly(ethylene glycol) mixture as a
solvent is reported, without the involvement of external shape-directing
agents. The precursor metal salt played a key role in the size, shape,
and phase selective evolution of iron oxide micro/nanomaterials. Whereas
self-assembled microrod superstructures were obtained using Fe(NO3)3 as the metal salt precursor, use of FeCl3 or Fe-acetate as precursors afforded hollow Fe2O3 microparticles and Fe3O4 nanoparticles,
respectively. A graphitic layer was deposited on the Fe3O4 surface, imparting a negative surface charge as a result
of a high-temperature treatment of poly(ethylene glycol). The rod-shaped
Fe3O4 microcrystals show efficient peroxidase-mimicking
activity toward 3,3,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and pyrogallol
as peroxidase substrates with a Michaelis–Menten rate constant
(Km) value of 0.05 and 0.52 mM, respectively.
The proficient enzyme mimicking behavior of these magnetic superstructures
was further explored for the degradation of organic dyes that includes
rhodamine B, methylene blue, and methyl orange with a rate constant
(k) of 0.038, 0.011, and 0.007 min–1 respectively, using H2O2. This fast and simple
method could help to develop a new pathway for differently shaped
oxide nanoparticles in a sustainable and economical manner that can
be harnessed as nanozymes for industrial as well as biological applications.

Introduction
Iron oxides (Fe3O4 or Fe2O3) are one of the
most abundant and important minerals on earth.
Considering the vast technological applications of these materials
in their nanometer dimension, development of synthetic methods with
control over size and shape is crucial. A size- and shape-dependent
magnetic behavior along with biocompatibility of iron oxide nanoparticles
has been harnessed for applications in areas such as ferrofluids,
heterogeneous catalysis, magnetic recording media, removal of toxic
elements (e.g., As, Pb, and Hg) from water, and several biomedical
applications (e.g., gene therapy, immunoassay, contrast enhancement
in magnetic resonance imaging, tissue repair, cell sorting, targeted
drug delivery for diseases such as cancer, hyperthermia, and DNA separation).1−12 Particular applications, such as biomedical ones, require the size
of the particles to be precisely controlled in the nanometer dimension
for effective permeability in vivo.13,14 However, for
several other applications, it has been suggested that microstructures
perform better than the corresponding nanostructures.15 Moreover, shape control is considered as a key for the
enhancement of several properties, including catalysis, as the exposed
crystal facets and hence atomic arrangement on the facets are known
to have a profound effect on its activity.16−20 Therefore, there has been a great emphasis on the
shape-selective growth of self-assembled ordered micrometer size iron
oxide superstructures from an assembly of nanocrystals that ensures
higher surface area, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity.

Several techniques have been adopted for the development of shape-selective
iron oxides that include mechanochemical (electrodeposition, pyrolysis,
laser ablation, combustion, etc.) and chemical (sol-gel synthesis,
temperature-assisted synthesis, hydrothermal, microwave, reverse micelle,
etc.) methods.21−24 The hydrothermal methods are especially attractive for tuning the
morphology of iron oxides, and various shapes like nanorods, cubes,
rings, nanospindles, and hollow particles have been reported using
this method.25−29 On the other hand, microwave methods provide a rapid and sustainable
synthetic protocol for achieving shape-selective morphology of iron
oxides. Recently, Polshettiwar et al. have reported the growth of
iron oxides with variable shapes using a template-based method in
a cyclohexane-water-pentanol reaction medium using a variety of iron
precursors having different solubilities.30 The polyol method of synthesis, which involves ethylene glycol as
a solvent as well as stabilizing agent, has evolved as a soft chemical
method for the preparation of a large variety of metal and metal oxide
nanomaterials with tunable size, shape, and composition.31−33 However, the role of counterions in the precursor metal salts on
the shape-selective growth of nanomaterials has not been understood
clearly. It is recognized that during the growth the inorganic anions
themselves might be selectively adsorbed on particular facets and
thus greatly impact the final morphology.34−36 Therefore,
it might be possible to obtain shape-selective iron oxides by varying
the precursor metal salts in a polyol-based synthesis without using
any external templates.

Iron oxide nanomaterials can be used
as a low-cost and biocompatible
alternative to the natural peroxidases, which are prone to loss of
activation in a harsh chemical environment.37 Studies of the structural effects of these materials on their enzyme-mimetic
behavior may be of high significance in designing materials for practical
utility. In this direction, we studied the evolution of self-assembled
iron oxide nano/microparticles with different morphologies using a
polyol-based microwave synthetic method just by varying the metal
salts (Scheme 1). Further,
we evaluated the peroxidase-mimicking activity of the iron oxides
and have observed significant enhancement in the nanozyme activity
in the case of rod-shaped superstructures originated in the presence
of NO3– as counter anions. Taking advantage
of the enhanced peroxidase mimetic behavior of these materials, we
have utilized these materials for swift degradation of commercial
dyes through a heterogeneous Fenton process that involves the generation
of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) by the reaction of hydrogen
peroxide and nanoscale iron oxide for the effective destruction of
dyes. Overall, a rapid polyol-based microwave-assisted synthetic method
has been developed for the generation of shape-selective Fe3O4 microstructures, which shows enhanced nanozyme activity
and can be harnessed for effective degradation of organic contaminants.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Fe3O4 Microrods
Self-assembled Fe3O4 microrods
were synthesized via a simple microwave-assisted pathway using Fe(III)
nitrate as the iron precursor and a mixture of PEG-200–water
(PEG:water = 9:1 v/v) as the solvent at 150 °C for 60 min. It
is well known that shape-selective synthesis of metal or metal oxide
nanoparticles usually requires external templates, which dictates
the oriented growth of the crystallites; however, in the present case,
the shape selectivity leading to the formation of Fe3O4 microrods could be achieved simply by microwave heating of
the metal salt in the polyol medium. The dark brown precipitates thus
obtained were analyzed by various spectroscopic and microscopic tools.
Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) studies confirmed the formation
of the rod-shaped microcrystals having dimensions of 800 nm width
and 3–6 μm length (Figures 1a and S1). However,
clusters of small nanocrystals of an average diameter of 10 ±
5 nm were found decorating the microcrystal surface. The results suggest
that small Fe3O4 nanoparticles were probably
assembled and grown directionally to form the microparticles. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) studies also suggested the formation of
the Fe3O4 microrods having similar dimensions
as obtained from the FESEM studies. Ultrasmall nanoparticles randomly
adhering to the microcrystals were clearly visible in the TEM images
(Figure 1b). The HRTEM
image of the nanoparticles bound on the microparticle surface showed
lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 0.25 nm that can be attributed
to the (311) atomic plane of magnetite (inset: Figure 1b). Furthermore, the elemental mapping of
the microrods reveals the existence of Fe, O, and C in the matrix
and all of these three components are spread homogeneously in the
microrod framework (Figure 1c). Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies also
validated the presence of carbon along with Fe and O in the matrix
(Figure S2).

Figure 1 (a) Scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) image, (b) TEM image (scale
bar 1 μm) of Fe3O4 microrods; inset: HRTEM
image of nanoparticles decorated on the microrod (scale bar 5 nm),
and (c) Elemental mapping of Fe3O4 microrods
obtained under microwave condition at 150 °C for 60 min in a
water–PEG mixture (1:9) using nitrate salt as a precursor.

The phase characteristics of the microparticles
were obtained from
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Figure 2a. Diffraction peaks at 2θ of 18.3,
30.1, 35.5, 43.1, 57.0, and 62.6 could be perfectly indexed to spinal
Fe3O4 and correspond to (111), (220), (311),
(400), (511), and (440) lattices, respectively (JCPDS no. 65-3107).
Interestingly, a broad band with maxima at around 2θ of 23.9°
was also observed, which could be assigned to the (002) plane of thin
carbonaceous layers.38,39 This suggests that a thin graphitic
layer might be deposited on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles.
Raman spectroscopy is a potent tool to characterize a distinctive
arrangement of crystal structures of carbon. Raman spectroscopy studies
showed two additional bands at 1350 and 1590 cm–1 along with characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 in
the range of 250–800 cm–1 (Figure 2b). The bands at 1350 and 1590
cm–1 could be endorsed to the D and G modes of carbon
in Fe3O4 microrods matrix, respectively.40,41 Whereas the G mode is originated from the planar vibrations of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, the D mode is defect-induced vibration
originated from the disordered structure of graphite and shows that
the carbon shell is partially graphitized and amorphous in nature.
Small molecular weight polymers such as PEG-200 are known as the carbon
precursor for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials such as carbon
dots under microwave irradiation.42 Hence,
the formation of a thin graphitic layer on the Fe3O4 microrods during the microwave heating of Fe metal precursors
using a polyol method is not surprising.43−46 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was performed to understand the composition and oxidation
state of the Fe3O4 microrods. The full spectrum
of the survey scan shows that iron (Fe), oxygen (O), and carbon (C)
are present in the sample. As shown in Figure 2c, two major XPS signals located at BEs of
710.3 and 724.0 eV can be attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe
2p1/2 levels, respectively. These peaks are further deconvoluted
to 4 peaks at 710.5, 713.2, 724.0, and 726.4 eV (Figure S3a). The peaks at 710.5 and 724.0 eV confirm the Fe2+ chemical state; on the other hand, peaks at 713.2 and 726.4
eV correspond to Fe3+ in the Fe3O4 phase. A small satellite peak at 719.0 eV confirmed the formation
of Fe3O4 phase in the microrods.47−50 The C 1s core-level spectrum of Fe3O4 microrods
could be fitted into three components, i.e., 284.4, 286.2, and 288.4
eV, which correspond to C–C/C–H, epoxy carbon in C-O,
and carboxyl groups, respectively (Figure S3b).51 The results further confirm the presence
of a thin carbon layer on the Fe3O4 composite.
Deconvolution of the O 1s signal suggested three peaks having binding
energies of 529.6, 531.5, and 533 eV, coinciding with lattice oxygen,
carbonyl oxygen, and alkoxy oxygen in Fe3O4 microrods,
respectively. (Figure S3c).52 The magnetic property of the Fe3O4 microparticles was investigated using a SQUID magnetometer
(Figure 2d). The M–H curve of the as-prepared material
showed zero magnetic coercivity at 300 K, depicting a super-paramagnetic
behavior. The saturation magnetization value was found to be 48 emu
g–1, which is lower than reported values for bare
Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The reduced Ms value of the microparticles might be attributed to the
interaction of disordered amorphous carbonaceous layers with the Fe3O4 surface.53

(b) Raman spectrum, (c) wide range XPS spectrum,
and (d) room-temperature magnetization curves as a function of the
field (M–H curve) of Fe3O4 microrods obtained under microwave condition
at 150 °C for 60 min in a water–PEG mixture (1:9) using
nitrate salt as a precursor.

The molecular orientation and local bonding environments of the
synthesized Fe3O4 particles were further confirmed
by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure S4). The FTIR
spectrum showed major vibrational peaks at 3440, 2928, 2360, 1628,
1053, 782, and 631 cm–1, which can be owing to the
vibrational modes of v(O-H stretching), v(-CH2), v(C–C stretching), v(C=C stretching), v(C-O stretching), v(O-H bending), and v(Fe-O), respectively.54,55 Further, two prominent peaks at 1427 and 1354 cm–1 were observed, which might arise due to the formation of mono or
bidentate complex of carboxylic group of the carbon layer with surface
Fe atoms.56 The results suggested that
the Fe3O4 surface was surface-passivated by
a carboxyl-functionalized carbon layer. This was further evident in
the ζ-potential measurement of the synthesized materials, which
showed a value of −21.3 mV, as compared to a value of +15.2
mV for a bare Fe3O4 nanoparticle (synthesized
through the well-known coprecipitation method using a mixture of Fe2+ and Fe3+ salts and NaOH under a N2 atmosphere in water).57 Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was employed to investigate the thermal stability of
the synthesized material. As shown in Figure S5, a weight loss of 3–4% up to 150 °C could be attributed
to the removal of the physically absorbed water. There was further
weight loss of 16% probably due to the elimination of functional groups
containing labile oxygen from the surface.41,58 The N2 isotherm, as shown in Figure S6, possesses the type IV isotherm with a small hysteresis
loop in the 0.4–1.0 P/P0 range, signifying the existence of mesopores. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area was calculated to be 62.0 m2 g–1, and the pore-size distribution from desorption analysis by the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method was found to be 3.7 nm.
Comparing to the small surface area of Fe3O4 nanoparticles,59 the composite has significantly
enhanced surface area, which might be due to the presence of a mesoporous
carbon layer on the surface.

Growth Mechanism
The polyol method,
which involves
the use of poly(ethylene glycol) as both a reducing and stabilizing
agent, is a well-known strategy for the growth of metal and metal
oxide nanoparticles, where the nucleation and growth of the nanocrystallites
can be achieved with desired thermodynamic and kinetic control leading
to self-assembled nanostructures. Shape selectivity of the nanocrystals
is usually achieved by additional shape-directing agents, which are
adsorbed preferentially on specific crystallographic planes, resulting
in the change of direction and rate of crystal growth. Although the
role of various additives on the stability of crystallographic planes
is elaborately studied, there are only a handful of reports elucidating
the influence of inorganic counterions in shape-selective growth of
metal oxide nanoparticles without the involvement of external agents.60,61

For the synthesis of the shape-selective Fe3O4 microrods, efficient and controlled heating provided by microwave
irradiation was used in a tightly sealed closed vessel and the growth
of the microrods was observed using Fe(NO3)3 as the starting precursor. Due to the fast kinetics of the nanocrystallite
synthesis, it was not possible to elucidate a growth mechanism from
time-dependent studies, as the microrod formation was observed even
after 15 min of microwave heating (Figure 3a). However, the decoration of small Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the microrods clearly suggests
that small nanocrystallites were initially formed, which gradually
self-assembled into a microrod over time. Further, controlled experiments
revealed that the amount of water in the solvent mixture played a
significant role in the self-assembly process. No Fe3O4 nanoparticles were obtained without water injection. Whereas
microrod formation occurred predominantly at a water-to-PEG ratio
of 1:9 in the solvent mixture, only a few microrod formations were
observed at a water-to-PEG ratio 1:1. On the other hand, only nanospheres
were formed when the water-to-PEG ratio was maintained at 9:1 (Figure S7). The results clearly infer the role
of PEG in the self-assembled growth of Fe3O4 microrods. Sealed vessel microwave processing allows rapid heating
of the reaction mixture, allowing quick occurrence of the nucleation
event relieving the solution supersaturation. Further growth of the
initially formed nucleates takes place in a high and constant flux
of monomers in a diffusion-limited process. The nanoparticles are
evolved progressively to higher dimensions in a process where the
dissolution and migration of adatoms to selective crystal planes takes
place continuously, to minimize the total surface energy (Ostwald
ripening). Along with their use as a high boiling point solvent, PEG
also can chelate with the surface of metal oxide nanoparticles. When
Fe(NO3)3 is dissolved in a 9:1 PEG–H2O mixture, there are two distinct phases: (i) formation of
a metal–aqua complex through the coordination of Fe3+ ions with water molecules and (ii) intermolecular hydrogen bridging
of H2O with PEG as the majority phase. At an elevated temperature
(higher than 100 °C), water is absent at the initial stage and
thus the rate of migration of adatoms is highly suppressed. This plays
an important role in controlling kinetics of the growth and stimulates
anisotropy. The growth rate might be further influenced by a significantly
slower diffusion rate of precursor metal salts in PEG, considering
the higher viscosity of polyol medium as compared with water.

Figure 3 (a) SEM micrograph
of Fe3O4 microrods obtained
under microwave condition at 150 °C for 15 min (water–PEG
ratio 1:9) and (b) schematic presentation depicting the formation
mechanism of Fe3O4 microrods obtained under
microwave condition at 150 °C using Fe(NO3)3 precursor salt and water–PEG as a solvent.

In a microwave-based synthesis, the heating rate is quite
fast
and the reaction temperature is achieved in a minute or two; hence,
it is very difficult to perform a kinetic study to understand the
growth mechanism and the intermediates involved. When we performed
the microwave synthesis at 80 °C keeping all other conditions
similar, we obtained a cluster of nanoparticles after 5 min of microwave
heating. SEM studies showed the formation of nanoparticles having
dimension of 40 ± 10 nm in diameter (Figure S8). X-ray powder diffraction study revealed that the obtained
nanoparticles had tetragonal FeOOH (β-FeOOH) structure (Figure S9). From these studies, we believe that
the formation of the Fe3O4 microrods took place
via β-FeOOH nanoparticle intermediates. Thus a plausible formation
mechanism can be suggested as 1  In
an aqua–PEG mixture, the initially
formed iron aqua complex undergoes dehydration to generate FeOOH nuclei
under a microwave treatment. A combination of coarsening and oriented
self-aggregation of the initially formed embryos leads to the growth
of larger crystals with shape selectivity largely controlled by the
Ostwald ripening process. A phase transformation occurred after an
extended reaction period. The presence of PEG as a mild reducing agent
ensures the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, thus
resulting in the formation of Fe3O4 microrods.
It can be clearly observed that the Fe3O4 microrods
consist of smaller Fe3O4 particles as building
blocks and have irregular surface, demonstrating that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles self-assemble into the microrods (Figure 3b).

It was
interesting to note that the self-assembled growth of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into one-dimensional microrods
occurred without the addition of any shape-selective agents. We assumed
that the NO3– counterions might play
a critical role in the shape evolution. Therefore, we varied the metal
salt precursors in the microwave-assisted polyol process, while keeping
all reaction parameters, such as concentration of the metal salt,
water-to-PEG ratio, reaction temperature, etc. constant. When FeCl3 was used as the precursor metal salt, hollow Fe2O3 microparticles with an average diameter of 1.1 ±
0.1 μm were obtained. SEM studies (Figure 4a) reveal the surface configuration of the
microspheres, which is not smooth, implying that these microspheres
are comprised of small nanoparticles as primary building units and
self-assembled to form the larger near spherical aggregates. The formation
of internal voids in the microspheres can be clearly seen in cracked
microspheres. All diffraction peaks in the hollow microsphere powder
XRD spectra (Figure 4b) could be indexed to the α-Fe2O3 hexagonal
phase (JCPDS card no. 33-664). Considering the oxidative etching properties
of the halide ions,62,63 the formation of the complex
hollow assemblies with a different phase could be easily understood.
When iron acetate was used as the precursor metal salt, only small
spherical Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average
dimension of 40 ± 10 nm were obtained. Acetates are known to
have high binding affinity for oxide surfaces and hence act as an
efficient stabilizer restricting the growth to smaller dimensions.
(Figure 4c). The results
suggest that the inorganic anions from the precursor salts were influential
in controlling the size, shape, and structural evolution of the micro/nanoparticles.

Figure 4 (a) SEM
image of Fe2O3 microparticles obtained
using FeCl3 salt as a precursor under microwave irradiation
at 150 °C for 60 min in a water–PEG mixture (1:9), (b)
XRD spectrum of Fe2O3 microparticles; (c) SEM
image of Fe3O4 obtained using Fe(OAc)3 as a salt precursor, and (d) SEM image of Fe3O4 microrods obtained using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O under a hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 12 h.

It is well-known that during the crystallization
process, the inorganic
anions might selectively adhere on particular facets. The FeOOH nucleates
initially obtained are stabilized by PEG molecules through chelation,
thus suppressing the nucleation and growth of nanocrystals in the
solution. The aggregation of formed nuclei takes place to eliminate
the interfaces and minimize the total energy of the system. NO3– ions are known to have different adsorption
strengths on different crystal facets,64 which might cause faster growth of nanocrystals in the direction
with weaker adsorption. Although the exact mechanism for the microrod
morphology could not be traced, we believe that a combination of both
anion facet coating and stabilization of adatoms by PEG was crucial
for growth of various superstructures. This was further confirmed
by the fact that when Fe(NO3)3 was hydrothermally
treated in a Teflon-sealed autoclave using a PEG–water mixture
as a solvent at 180 °C for 12 h, the resultant precipitate consisted
of Fe3O4 microrods with an average diameter
of 0.5–0.7 μm and several micrometers of length with
a much smoother surface as compared with the microwave-based method
(Figure 4d). The formation
of the graphitic layer on the nanoparticle surface could be realized
as the microwave/hydrothermal treatment of PEG leads to the formation
of carbonaceous materials.

Oxidation of Peroxidase Substrates Catalyzed
by Rod-Shaped Fe3O4 Microcrystals
In
recent years, the
enzyme-mimetic activities of metal oxide nanoparticles have been pursued
extensively. The natural enzymes are prone to deactivation if the
reaction conditions such as pH of the medium or temperature are modulated
to some extent. Due to their ease of synthesis, coupled with their
stability under harsh reaction conditions, metal oxides are considered
as an ideal alternative to natural enzymes for various applications.65−70 The peroxidase-mimicking activity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles is well studied, and there are reports on the enhancement
of peroxidase activity depending on the shape of the nanocrystals.59 The catalytic oxidation of the 3.3,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) was carried out in the presence of H2O2, to assess the peroxidase-like activity of the Fe3O4 microrods, and the progress of the reaction was monitored
via UV–visible spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 5a, the colorless substrate TMB is oxidized
in the presence of H2O2 and Fe3O4 microrods to a blue solution, with enhancement in absorption
intensity at 370 and 652 nm. In the absence of H2O2, addition of only Fe3O4 microrod to
TMB resulted in negligible color variation under similar experimental
conditions. These results indicate that the Fe3O4 microrods demonstrate an efficient peroxidase-like behavior toward
typical peroxidase substrates like TMB and a blue charge-transfer
complex (chromogen) is formed quickly, catalyzed by the Fe3O4 microrods in presence of H2O2. To achieve an optimal response, the effects of pH on the catalytic
activities of the Fe3O4 microcrystals were investigated
in a series of buffer at varying pH from 2 to 10. The response curves
(Figure 5b) show that
the maximum catalytic activity was obtained at pH 4.0, which is very
similar to the operating conditions for horseradish peroxidase (HRP).37,71 To eliminate the role of any leached iron in the catalytic reaction,
the iron contents of the supernatants after removal of the microrods
by centrifugation were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic
emission spectroscopy and the amount of Fe ions was negligible in
the pH range of 3–6. The catalytic activity of any leached
iron ions was evaluated for the catalytic reaction at pH 4.0. For
this, the Fe3O4 microrods were incubated in
an acetate buffer at pH 4.0 for 30 min and the supernatant solution
after removal of the microrods was used to monitor the oxidation of
TMB. The original colorless solution remained colorless, confirming
that no leached Fe ions were involved in the catalytic process, as
the concentration of leached ions was much lower than the amount required
for typical Fenton reactions. Thus, a 100 mM acetate buffer solution
at pH 4.0 was selected as the optimal reaction medium for all subsequent
studies.

H2O2 concentration; (insets of (e) and (f))
double-reciprocal plots of Fe3O4 activity at
a fixed concentration of one substrate (TMB and H2O2) versus varying concentration of the other.

The dependence of the peroxidase-mimicking activity of Fe3O4 microrods on various parameters, such as concentration
of TMB and H2O2 and amount of the catalyst,
was also carefully monitored by observing the absorption peak at 652
nm (Figure 5c,d). The
maximum catalytic efficiency was achieved at 0.1 mM of TMB, whereas
in the case of H2O2, a higher concentration
of H2O2 was required to attain the maximum peroxidase-like
activity. This indicates that the catalytic activity of the microcrystals
is more prominent at high concentrations of H2O2 as compared with HRP. At higher concentration of TMB in the reaction
medium, the peroxidase activity was weakened, probably due to sufficient
catalytic surface capping at a particular concentration, thus inhibiting
the attachment of excess substrates onto the surface. The maximum
catalytic activity of the Fe3O4 microrods was
achieved at a H2O2 concentration of 1000 mmol/mL,
which is 105 times that of TMB. A catalyst concentration
as low as 8 μg mL–1 was used to monitor the
kinetic parameters.

The steady-state kinetic assays were performed
in the TMB-H2O2-Fe3O4 reaction
system
at room temperature, and the catalytic parameters were evaluated by
correlating the absorbance data with the Michaelis–Menten equation
(eqn). 2  where Km is the
Michaelis constant and ν, Vmax,
and [S] correspond to the rate of conversion, maximal velocity (or
the maximal conversion rate), and substrate concentration, respectively.

A typical Michaelis–Menten kinetics model was validated
during the TMB-H2O2 reaction catalyzed by the
Fe3O4 microrods, as observed from the initial
absorbance against time plots (Figure 5e,f). The slopes of these plots are evaluated as initial
reaction rates at variable substrate concentrations. The catalytic
parameters of Km and Vmax were obtained by plotting the reaction rate against
concentration and following nonlinear regression using the Michaelis–Menten
equation. The Km value of Fe3O4 microrods with TMB as a substrate was calculated to
be 0.05 mM, which is significantly lower compared with the reported
value of 3.7 mM in the case of native horseradish peroxidase. This
indicates a stronger affinity of Fe3O4 microrods
for TMB compared with HRP (Table S1).27,37,72 The higher peroxidase-like activity
of the Fe3O4 microrods was consistent for H2O2 as a substrate also (0.09 mM), with a lower Km value. The high peroxidase activity of the
microrods can be correlated to the presence of large number of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions on their surface, compared with
only one iron in HRP. For comparison, we also evaluated the peroxidase
activity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles synthesized
using Fe(OAc)3 as a salt precursor and Fe2O3 hollow microparticles obtained using FeCl3 as
the precursor metal salt, using TMB as the substrate. From the plot
of the reaction rate vs concentration of TMB and using the Michaelis–Menten
kinetic model, Km values were calculated
to be 0.15 and 0.31 mM for Fe3O4 nanoparticles
and Fe2O3 hollow microparticles, respectively
(Figure S10). From the results, it is evident
that the Fe3O4 microrods showed superior peroxidase-mimicking
activity for TMB, compared with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
or hollow Fe2O3 microparticles. The graphitic
layer on the Fe3O4 particles also might contribute
to the enhanced peroxidase-mimicking activity of the microrods, as
several carbonaceous nanomaterials are known to demonstrate peroxidase-mimicking
properties.68

It is well-established
that peroxidase mimics catalyze the decomposition
of H2O2, leading to efficient generation of
hydroxyl radicals (•OH); therefore, a fluorescent
probe was used to track the formation of •OH radicals
catalyzed by Fe3O4 microrods. The experiment
was performed using weak fluorescent terephalic acid as probe, which
generates a highly fluorescent hydroxyl terephthalic acid as a product
when reacted with •OH radicals (Figure 6a).73,74 In the presence of Fe3O4 microrods and H2O2, the free radical generation was clearly evident,
as exhibited by a dramatic increase in fluorescence (Figure 6b). As the reaction progressed,
the fluorescence intensity of terephalic acid enhanced at 440 nm.
These results indicated that the peroxidase-mimicking activity of
Fe3O4 microrods was mainly due to their potential
to generate •OH radicals during the course of reaction.

acid oxidation by Fe3O4 and H2O2. Inset: Normalized fluorescence spectra of the oxidation

Kinetic Study of Pyrogallol
The peroxidase-mimicking
activity of the as-obtained Fe3O4 microrods
was further evaluated for the oxidation of pyrogallol in the presence
of H2O2, which forms a yellow purpurogallin
complex. Upon addition of Fe3O4 microcrystals
(20 μg mL–1) and H2O2 to a solution of pyrogallol in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the colorless
solution turned yellow, with the appearance of a new absorption peak
at 420 nm, signifying catalytic oxidation of the peroxidase substrate
(Figure S11a). The reaction was monitored
at different time intervals by varying the concentration of pyrogallol
and H2O2. The catalytic reaction was completed
after 30 min, and the absorbance at 420 nm remained stable. The time-dependent
formation of the purpurogallin complex was also monitored for the
Fe3O4 nanoparticles and Fe2O3 hollow microparticles, which showed relatively lower catalytic
activity compared with the Fe3O4 microrods (Figure S11b). Similar to TMB, the oxidation of
pyrogallol also follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Studying
the kinetics at variable pyrogallol concentrations and keeping the
H2O2 concentration constant, a Lineweaver–Burk
plot was obtained for catalysis using Fe3O4 microrods,
which showed a linear relationship (Figure 7a,b). From the Lineweaver–Burk plot,
the Michaelis–Menten constant Km was evaluated. The calculated Km value
of 0.52 mM for pyragallol is lower than that of the natural enzyme
HRP (0.81 mM), indicating that the Fe3O4 catalysts
have higher affinity toward the substrate.75 The Km value was obtained from the Lineweaver–Burk
plot at variable H2O2 concentrations, while
keeping the pyrogallol concentration fixed at 17 mM.

Degradation of Dye Pollutants Using Fe3O4 as
Catalyst
Organic dyes are predominantly used in several
industries, such as photographic printing, textile, tannery, paper-pulp,
and paints, and are mixed with soil and water, causing severe damage
to the environment. To get rid of these hazardous pollutants, various
processes, such as ozonation, chlorination, adsorption, ultrafiltration,
electrochemical processes, photodegradation using photocatalysts,
and advanced oxidation processes such as Fenton reactions are used
as methods for waste-water treatment.76 H2O2 is considered to be a green oxidant that
behaves as resource of reactive oxygen species. Chemical oxidation
routes generate strong oxidizing species such as hydroxyl radical
(•OH), which can be used for efficient removal of
organic dye contaminants. However, due to low decomposition of H2O2 at room temperature, catalysts are often required
for the sustained formation of •OH radicals. A combination
of nanocatalysts and H2O2 in a single process
could function as an attractive substitute for dye removal.

Encouraged by the high peroxidase-mimicking activity of Fe3O4 microcrystals, we further examined the activity of
Fe3O4 microrods for the degradation of common
organic dyes. Considering the fact that the overall surface charge
of the microcrystals was negative, we first studied the degradation
of cationic rhodamine B as a model contaminant. The degradation of
the dye was visually observed in a mixture of Fe3O4 catalyst, H2O2, and rhodamine B in
aqueous medium, and complete decolorization occurred within 120 min
at room temperature. The absorption of the dye gradually decreased
with increasing Fe3O4 concentration, indicating
that the dye degradation efficiency was highly dependent on the nanocatalyst
concentration (Figure S12). To optimize
the reaction conditions, a concentration-dependent study was performed
by varying the concentration of H2O2 from 0–50
mM (Figure S13). At a lower concentration
of H2O2, a slower degradation of rhodamine B
was observed. As the concentration was increased to 50 mM, the rate
of degradation increased, suggesting that a H2O2 concentration of 50 mM was optimal for dye degradation. Further,
degradation of rhodamine B was studied at different pH. Figure S14 clearly shows that the maximum rhodamine
degradation efficiency was found at pH 4, a similar pH range at which
the maximum peroxidase activity was obtained. The quick degradation
and a gradual reduction in the prominent absorption peak intensity
at 553 nm were further observed during the time-dependent UV–visible
spectroscopy studies. A linear correlation between the reaction time
and ln(Ct/C0) could be ascertained (Figure 8a), suggesting that a pseudo-first-order pathway was
followed during the dye degradation reaction with a rate constant
of 0.038 min–1. Control reactions were performed
in the absence of the catalyst or H2O2, and
no initiation of the dye degradation occurred even after prolonged
time, suggesting that a combination of Fe3O4 microcrystals and H2O2 was essential for the
degradation reaction. The excellent performance of Fe3O4 microcrystals for the rhodamine B degradation could be ascribed
to a combination of the high surface area of the microcrystals and
efficient peroxidase activity.

Figure 8 Catalytic degradation of dyes with H2O2 on
Fe3O4 microrods as catalysts: (a) time-dependent
absorbance changes at 553 nm for rhodamine B, (b) time-dependent UV–visible
spectra of an aqueous solution of rhodamine B; (c, d) time-dependent
absorbance changes at 663 nm for MB and 463 nm for MO, (e) dye removal
efficiency in the absence or presence of H2O2; and (f) repeating utilization rate of catalyst after the degradation
procedure is repeated five times.

From the time-dependent kinetics studies, it was apparent that
no shift in the absorption maxima at 553 nm was observed in the initial
60 min (Figure 8b)
and only a continuous reduction in the absorbance was observed. It
has been reported that N-de-ethylation and cleavage of the chromophore
are two competitive ways of degradation of rhodamine B, followed by
other reactions, such as hydroxylation, aromatic ring opening, and
mineralization. In the case of N-de-ethylation, auxochromic properties
of N-ethyl moieties lead to a hypsochromic shift in the absorption
maxima.77 On the other hand, only a reduction
in the absorption peak at 553 nm is observed during chromophore cleavage.
In the initial stage of the RhB degradation under the present reaction
conditions, only a reduction in λmax at 553 nm occurred,
suggesting that the chromophore cleavage was the favored pathway for
the degradation. The concentration of H2O2 was
much higher than rhodamine B in the reaction medium, and most of the
N-de-ethylation intermediates formed during the reaction might be
cleaved immediately by the generated hydroxyl radicals. Toward the
later stages of RhB degradation, the absorption maxima shifted to
lower wavelengths by 5 and 11 nm, after 60 and 90 min, respectively.
However, any significant effect of the absorption shifting on the
reaction kinetics can be neglected, as less than 10% of the original
RhB concentration was left at that stage. On the basis of these studies,
a synergistic mechanism for the degradation of rhodamine B in H2O2–Fe3O4 system is
proposed. H2O2 molecules are adsorbed on the
surface of Fe3O4 followed by activation of H2O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (•OH radicals) by the surface Fe(II)/Fe(III) atoms. The •OH radicals then cleave the dyes adsorbed on the surface or diffuse
into the solution to degrade the dye molecules near the Fe3O4/solution interface.

The degradation of other
commonly used dyes, such as methylene
blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO), was further monitored using the
Fe3O4-H2O2 catalytic system
to ascertain the scope of the present method in waste-water treatment
(Figure 8c–e
and S15). UV–visible spectroscopy
studies were performed to monitor the decay in the concentrations
of MB and MO in the solution by observing absorbance at λmax 663 and 463 nm, respectively. In comparison with the degradation
of rhodamine B (degradation efficiency DE = 98% and k = 0.038 min–1), the degradation was moderate for
MB (DE = 77% and k = 0.011 min–1) and MO (DE = 60% and k = 0.007 min–1), under similar reaction conditions (0.5 mg mL–1 of Fe3O4 microrods, 50 mmol L–1 of H2O2 and 0.1 mmol of dye after 2 h at room
temperature). It is evident that RhB was degraded faster than MB,
although they are both cationic in nature. The carboxyl group in rhodamine
B might influence the formation hydroxyl radicals and facilitate their
attack on the dye molecules through hydrogen bonding.77,78 MO is an anionic dye and possibly is lowly adsorbed on Fe3O4 surface due to the electrostatic repulsion, severely
impacting its degradation.

Catalyst reusability and stability
are regarded as important parameters
for practical catalytic applications. We compared the dye removal
activity of the fresh and recovered Fe3O4 catalysts
toward RhB, and a catalyst concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1 was used. After every cycle, the catalyst is directly withdrawn
from the solution by centrifugation followed by thorough washing and
redispersed in distilled H2O for the next cycle of catalysis
by adding RhB and H2O2. This catalyst retained
good activity (82%) even after reuse five times, suggesting high stability
of the catalyst even in the presence of a large amount of H2O2 (Figure 8f).

To verify whether Fe3O4 microrods
can be
employed to treat environmental water, tap water and lake water were
collected from an industrial area (Pithampur, Indore) and used as
the practical sample (Figure S16). This
was kept for some time and then filtered before being spiked with
rhodamine B as the model pollutant. When Fe3O4 microrods and H2O2 were added to this dye
containing water, effective discoloration of the solution occurred
within a short time (90 min) due to the degradation of rhodamine B.
Even in the lake water containing a mixture of dyes (rhodamine B,
MO, and MB), the Fe3O4 microrods could effectively
degrade all dyes in the presence of H2O2. Therefore,
the Fe3O4 microrods can be employed as a promising
nanocatalyst for the environmental waste-water treatment.

Conclusions
A novel microwave-based synthetic methodology has been developed
for the rapid self-assembled growth of Fe3O4 microrods using polyol method without the aid of any external shape-directing
molecular templates. The growth of the size, shape, and morphology-selective
micro/nanostructures was highly dependent on the iron precursor salt
used for the synthesis, demonstrating the role of counterions in directing
the growth mechanism. The microwave treatment of the iron precursors
in a polyol medium also led to the growth of a thin carbonaceous layer
on the Fe3O4 microcrystals. The Fe3O4 microrods showed excellent peroxidase-mimicking activity
against substrates such as TMB and pyrogallol, demonstrating their
high capability for applications in environmental remediation in presence
of H2O2. This property was taken advantage of
for the degradation of common organic pollutants, such as cationic
and anionic dyes, with high efficiency. The method presents a simple,
one-step synthesis of magnetic microrods with high stability (negligible
iron leaching, no phase transformation after reaction), large surface
area, and the possibility of magnetic separation, which can be harnessed
for several other technological applications, such as degradation
of other organic contaminants, photocatalysis, etc.

Characterization
UV–visible
absorption spectra
and kinetic studies were recorded at room temperature on a Varian
UV–visible spectrophotometer (Carry 100 Bio). The infrared
spectrum (IR) was recorded in a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer
in the transmission mode using KBr pellets to prepare the samples.
Powder X-ray diffraction spectra (XRD) of the as-prepared sample were
measured by a Rigaku Smart lab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in the range of 2θ of 10–80°.
For scanning transmission electron microscopy (SEM) studies, samples
were prepared by dropcasting on a ITO surface and the images were
recorded on a Supra 55 Zeiss apparatus field emission scanning electron
microscope, with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) attachment. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were
recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope (accelerating voltage of
200 kV). To prepare the samples for TEM testing, the sample solutions
were cast on the coated copper grid and dried at room temperature.
Emission spectra were recorded using a fluoromax-4p fluorometer from
Horiba (model FM-100). The CEM discover Microwave reactor was used
for the synthesis of materials. A Raman spectrum was recorded using
the Jobin Yvon Horiba LABRAM-HR micro Raman system with a 632.8 He-Ne
laser beam attachment. Magnetic property was investigated using an
Ever Cool 7 Tesla SQUID Magnetometer. The surface area assessment
of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) was performed on Auto-sorb
iQ, version 1.11 (Quantachrome Instruments). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was performed using the Mg Kα radiation photoemission
tool PHI 5000 Versa Prob II, FEI Inc.

Synthesis of Fe3O4 Micro/Nanoparticles
with Controlled Morphology
Rod-shaped iron oxide microcrystals
were obtained by dissolving Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (196 mg, 80 mM) in a PEG-200–water mixture (PEG:water
ratio 9:1, total volume 5 mL). The mixture was then transferred into
a screw-mount glass tube and subjected to 150 W, 200 psi, and 150
°C microwave radiation for 60 min. This resulted in a dark brown
dispersion of Fe3O4. The precipitate was cleaned
with water and ethanol several times after cooling to eliminate impurities.
For the synthesis of hollow microspheres and nanospheres, FeCl3·3H2O (80 mM) and Fe(C2H3O2)2 (80 mM) were used as iron precursors,
respectively, keeping all other synthetic parameters similar. For
the hydrothermal synthesis of Fe3O4 nanorods,
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (80 mM) precursor
salt was dissolved in 20 mL of the PEG-200–water mixture (the
PEG:water ratio was 9:1 v/v) and was transferred in a Teflon-sealed
autoclave, which was kept at 180 °C for 12 h.

Peroxidase-Mimicking
Activity Studies
The peroxidase-like
activity of the synthesized Fe3O4 microstructure
was studied for the oxidation of TMB as a substrate. Kinetic experiments
were conducted in time-dependent mode using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
to monitor absorbance at 652 nm. Experiments were carried out using
20 μL of a Fe3O4 microrod stock solution
(1 mg mL–1) in a total volume of 2.5 mL of sodium
acetate buffer solution (100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0). TMB (0.1
mM) was used as a substrate and H2O2 concentration
was 4 mM, unless stated otherwise. The steady-state kinetic measurements
were performed under the optimal reaction conditions by varying the
TMB concentration from 0.01 to 0.2 mM at a fixed concentration of
4 mM H2O2. Similarly, the kinetic analysis of
Fe3O4 with H2O2 as the
substrate was performed by using a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM TMB
and varying the amount of H2O2 (0.05–0.4
mM ). The effect of pH (2–10), TMB concentration (0.01–0.5
mM), and H2O2 concentration (0.01–2000
mM) on the catalytic activity of Fe3O4 microcrystals
was also investigated.

The kinetic studies of pyrogallol oxidation
were carried out in a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution at room temperature.
The concentration of pyrogallol was varied while maintaining a constant
amount of Fe3O4 catalyst (20 μg mL–1) and H2O2 concentration (40
mM). The Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) was calculated using Lineweaver–Burk plots of the
double reciprocal of the Michaelis–Menten equation.

Detection
of Hydroxyl Radicals
In a typical reaction
process, 1.0 mg of Fe3O4 microrods was dispersed
via sonication in 5.0 mL of sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) solution
containing 50 mM H2O2, followed by addition
of 1 mM terephthalic acid and 3 mM NaOH. After incubation, the suspension
was centrifuged at different time intervals; at an excitation wavelength
of 315 nm, the supernatant was collected for fluorescence measurement.

Dye Degradation
For the dye degradation studies, 0.5
mg mL–1 Fe3O4 microrods were
dispersed into 20 mL of rhodamine B stock solution (0.1 mmol L–1) prepared in acetate buffer (pH 4.0). After preadsorbtion
at room temperature for 5 min, the absorption of rhodamine B was measured
by UV–visible spectroscopy and considered as C0 (initial concentration). Addition of 50 mM H2O2 into the above solution initiated rapid catalytic degradation
of rhodamine B. About 2.5 mL of the solution was taken out from the
reaction mixture at an interval of 20 min, and the suspended Fe3O4 particles were removed either by centrifugation
at 8000 rpm for 2 min or by magnetic separation. The absorption of
the supernatants was recorded on a UV–visible spectrophotometer.
Similarly, the dye removal efficiency of Fe3O4 microrods was investigated by time-dependent measurement of absorption
maxima of MO (0.1 mM) and MB (0.1 mM) dyes in aqueous medium under
similar reaction conditions. We also examined the effect of pH, concentration
of catalyst, and H2O2 concentration (0–50
mM) on the catalytic efficiency of dye degradation.
