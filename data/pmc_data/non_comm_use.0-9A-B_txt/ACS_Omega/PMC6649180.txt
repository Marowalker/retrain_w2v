Evaluating the efficiency of predictive
methods is critical to
the processes of upscaling laboratory processes to full-scale operations
on an industrial scale. With regard to separation of lanthanoids,
there is a considerable motivation to optimize these processes because
of immediate use in nuclear fuel cycle operations, nuclear forensics
applications, and rare-earth metal recovery. Efficient predictive
capabilities in Gibbs free energies of reaction are essential to optimize
separations and ligand design for selective binding needed for various
radiochemical applications such as nuclear fuel disposition and recycling
of lanthanoid fission products into useful radioisotope products.
Ligand design is essential for selective binding of lanthanoids, as
separating contiguous lanthanoids is challenging because of the similar
behavior these elements exhibit. Modeling including electronic structure
calculations of lanthanoid-containing compounds is particularly challenging
because of the associated computational cost encountered with the
number of electrons correlated in these systems and relativistic considerations.
This study evaluates the predictive capabilities of various ab initio
methods in the calculation of Gibbs free energies of reaction for
[Ln(NO3)]2+ compounds (with Ln = La to Lu),
as nitrates are critical in traditional separation processes utilizing
nitric acid. The composite methodologies evaluated predict Gibbs free
energies of reaction for [Ln(NO3)]2+ compounds
within 5 kcal mol–1 in most cases from the target
method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3+SO] at a fraction of the
computational cost.

Introduction
Nuclear operations
involve handling of fission products (many of
which are lanthanoids) and the partitioning for inclusion for other
industrial processes such as radioisotope source production, nuclear
forensics measurements, or waste disposition. Efficient and cost-effective
methods of partitioning fission products into useful waste or product
streams require specialized chemical processes that are well-suited
for these unique applications. Development of these processes to separate
fission products also requires careful selection of ligands to selectively
extract useful elements (such as rare-earth metals) from bulk materials.
These ligands are often selected based on radiation tolerance because
degradation of chemical components from irradiation may result in
a decrease of process efficiency.1 Design
of selective ligands to optimize separation processes often involves
hazardous experiments that could greatly benefit from additional information
regarding the suitability of a given ligand. Furthermore, lanthanoids
are often used as surrogates for complexation and structural analysis
of actinoid compounds as it was recently highlighted in a study by
Corbey and co-workers for americium compounds.2

Although there have been many advances in separation science,
efficient
and highly selective binding to lanthanoids and actinoids continues
to be present challenges.3,4 Consequently, developing
effective computational protocols to model lanthanoid-binding characteristics
can aid researchers in nuclear operations to design new and improved
methods of separating lanthanoids from bulk materials. Traditional
electronic structure modeling of lanthanoid-containing compounds can
be computationally expensive and inefficient for rapid predictive
capabilities of large fully complexed compounds. Increasing the efficiency
of these methods can provide a means of further optimizing chemical
processes while providing guidance in laboratory experiments (i.e.,
preselection of potentially efficient ligands) without requiring the
use of extensive computational resources, thus providing tools to
optimize separation processes to a wider segment of the community.
Benchtop chemical processes are often focused on determining if a
particular method is possible and less on the efficiency of the chemical
process. Although this is adequate for exploratory laboratory exercises,
the question of efficiency in upscaling must be considered for any
wide adoption of a process. To this end, determination of the thermochemical
characteristics and prediction of how these may affect larger industrial
processes is a significant consideration. Providing engineers with
predictive capabilities to perform low-cost (both computationally
and monetarily) simulations of complex lanthanoid systems and predictions
of separation efficiency reduce the overall cost of industrial process
design. Cost reduction stems from the ability to prototype systems
in a virtual environment such that primary and alternate designs may
be evaluated for further, often costlier, exploration.5

Among electronic structure methods in computational
modeling, density
functional theory (DFT) methods have been widely used to describe
the thermochemical properties of lanthanoid-containing compounds.
DFT can describe electron correlation at a reasonable computational
cost; however, the predicted thermochemical characteristics can be
largely dependent on the choice of level of theory as it was recently
shown in a systematic study of 5f elements in an actinoid nitrate
study.6 Furthermore, ab initio7 and composite methods8 have been used for thermochemical predictions, but these methodologies
vary in computational cost and accuracy. Utilizing ab initio methods
for lanthanoid-containing compounds can be challenging because of
the number of electrons and basis functions needed to describe these
systems, which increase the computational cost. Composite methods,
such as f-ccCA9 (which
follows the correlation consistent Composite Approach, ccCA, methodology10,11) and Feller–Peterson–Dixon (FPD),12 have been developed to describe the thermochemical properties
of lanthanoid systems with the accuracy of methods such as coupled
cluster with perturbative doubles and triples [CCSD(T)] at a lower
computational cost. Both of these methods describe dynamical electron
correlation, outer-core electron correlation, and effects due to special
relativity including spin–orbit (SO) coupling. There have also
been studies which utilized ab initio methods for thermochemical9,13 and spectroscopic13 analysis of small
lanthanoid compounds.

Establishing accurate and cost-effective
predictive computational
models for selective binding of lanthanoids and actinoids is essential
for the optimization and design of separations agents; and as previously
indicated, reliable predictive capabilities for lanthanoid compounds
are not only needed for fission products but also as surrogates for
actinoid studies. Large systematic analysis of lanthanoid-containing
complexes performed with ab initio methods can become highly restricted
by the size of the compounds because of the computational constraints.
This study focuses on lanthanoid mononitrate as this is a highly important
system in lanthanoid- and actinoid-separation because of the common
binding of one or more nitrates stemming from the often use of nitric
acid in the separation process14,15—as also noted
by Glatz in cataloguing all of the industrial processing for handling
spent nuclear fuel.16 Because of the presence
of nitric acid, nitrates bound to lanthanoids and actinoids have been
observed in multiple separations, and synthesis and characterization
studies with bis[(phosphino)methyl]pyridine-1-oxide (NOPOPO),2 1,2-phenylenediphosphonates,17 2,6-bis[(diphenylphosphino)methyl]pyridine N,P,P′-trioxide,18 2-((diphenylphosphino) methyl)pyridine, dioxide
and 2,6-bis((diphenylphosphino)methyl)pyridineiV,P,P′-trioxide,19 decorated pyridine and pyridine n-oxide platforms,3 tetra-n-donor extractants,20 undiluted quaternary ammonium ionic liquid,21 cyclic dilactams,22 bis-1,2,3-triazolebipyridine,23 and cyclic
imide dioximes,24 among others.

This
work evaluates the performance of ab initio methodologies
including MP2 and CCSD(T) calculations, along with composite methods
to predict the Gibbs free energy of reaction involving the binding
of nitrates to lanthanoid ions across the lanthanoid series (namely
[Ln(NO3)]2+, with Ln = La to Lu). Additionally,
the proposed method A and method B (as described in the Methods section) are evaluated for the prediction of Gibbs
free energies of reaction of [Ln(OH)]2+. The [Ln(OH)]2+ model system is chosen as a secondary test set for the proposed
methods because of hydroxyl anions bound to lanthanoids being important
in separations of lanthanoids and actinoids, as illustrated in separations
of americium from lanthanoids.25

Methods
The ab initio methods, MP226,27 and CCSD(T),27 are used to calculate the Gibbs free energies
of reaction of [Ln(NO3)]2+ (where Ln = La–Lu).
These methods are also used to determine the accuracy of the composite
methodologies utilized in this study. Correlation-consistent basis
sets are used throughout this study. The cc-pVnZ-DK312 basis set is used for the lanthanoids, whereas cc-pVnZ-DK28 is used for the N and O atoms (where n = ζ level). Also, the weighted core valence (cc-pwCVnZ-DK3
for Ln atoms; cc-pCVnZ-DK for N and O atoms)12,28 is used when accounting for core correlation. The third-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess
Hamiltonian29 is used to describe scalar
relativistic effects.

The model reaction for this study is described
by eq 1. 1  

Six ab initio methods are used to compute Gibbs free energies of
the reaction of [Ln(NO3)]2+ compounds [with
Ln = La–Lu]. These methods are CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3, MP2-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3,
CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCVTZ-DK3, MP2-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3, CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3,
and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3. The description of the correlation
space is indicated with the “FS” labels (for “frozen
shell”), with FSI and FSII referring to the electrons in the
correlation space. The FSI calculations include the valence electrons
in the correlation space (4f5s5p for Ln atoms and 2s2p for N and O
atoms). The FSII calculations add the outer-core electrons (FSI +
4s4p4d for Ln atoms and FSI + 1s for N and O atoms). The cc-pV∞Z-DK3
cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3 refers to the basis sets used to calculate at
the complete basis set (CBS)8 limit. For
the CBS calculations, the Hartree–Fock extrapolations use a
two-point formula developed by Karton and Martin,30 described by eq 2 2  where n is 3 and 4 for triple-
and quadruple-ζ basis sets (cc-pVTZ-DK3 and cc-pVQZ-DK3),12,28 respectively. The correlation energy is extrapolated using a two-point
extrapolation formula31 described by eq 3, with n = 2 and 3 (as utilized by Lu and Peterson12 for lanthanoid-containing systems). 3  

The accuracy of predictive capabilities of
these methods is evaluated
with respect to CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3 (i.e., target method
included in this study) as it contains the highest amount of dynamic
electronic correlation, outer-core correlation, and extrapolation
to the CBS limit.

Various composite schemes have also been utilized,
including f-ccCA9 and
newly proposed variations
(method A and method B). The total energy described by f-ccCA9 is shown by eq 4. 4  

The reference energy
(Eref) is described
by MP2-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3. The ΔEcc term describes higher dynamic electronic correlation from CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3.
The ΔECV term describes the electronic
correlation from the outer-core electronic correlation from CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCVTZ-DK3.
The ΔEspin term describes the SO
interactions from the four-component Dirac–Hartree–Fock
and triple-ζ basis set developed by Dyall,32 and it is calculated as shown in previous work.33

Another composite scheme, similar to f-ccCA9 except that the ΔEspin term is removed, is shown by eq 5. This composite method is referred
throughout
this article as method A. 5  

Last, the composite scheme described
by eq 6 removes the ΔECC term and utilizes CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3
in the
reference energy (instead of MP2). This composite method is referred
to as method B throughout this article. 6  

The Gibbs free energy for the proposed
reaction (ΔGrxn) for eq 1 is calculated as shown in eq 7, with the total energy
obtained with the
methods described in eqs 4–6, and thermochemical corrections obtained
with DFT at 298.15 K (for the optimized structures as indicated in
the Methods section). This approach was recently
utilized in a similar study of [An(NO3)]2+ compounds,
for which the thermochemical corrections for the Gibbs free energies
of reaction are obtained at each level of theory utilized for the
geometry and vibrational frequency calculations.6 7  

Although
the focus of this study is on nitrate binding to lanthanoids,
methods A and B are also evaluated against the target methodology
for Gibbs free energies of reaction for hydroxyl anion binding to
lanthanoids (namely [Ln(OH)]2+) for method-verification
purposes.

The geometry optimizations are performed utilizing
DFT following
a protocol in previous work,34 with the
B3LYP35,36 functional, the Stuttgart RSC Segmented
ECP and associated basis set for the lanthanoid atoms, and the 6-311++G**37 basis set for O and N atoms with tight tolerances
and extra fine grid. The ECP accounts for scalar relativistic effects
by replacing 28 electrons with a relativistic pseudopotential. The
compounds are optimized without imposing symmetry constraints. Thermochemical
corrections are calculated at 298.15 K. No imaginary frequencies were
found. The geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations
calculated with the B3LYP functional are obtained with the NWChem
6.8 package.38 All single-point calculations
(except for Dirac–Hartree–Fock) are performed with MOLPRO2015.39 The DIRAC1640 software
package was used for Dirac–Hartree–Fock calculations.
Basis sets for non-lanthanoids are obtained from the Environmental
Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) database.41,42

The Gibbs free energies of reaction (ΔGrxn) for the [Ln(NO3)]2+ complexes are
calculated with the proposed methods described in the Methods section [namely CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3, MP2-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3,
CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCVTZ-DK3, MP2-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3, CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3,
and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3]. The predicted ΔGrxn of the [Ln(NO3)]2+ compounds for the lanthanoid series calculated by these methods
are shown by Figure 1. All predicted ΔGrxn are tabulated
in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Predicted Gibbs free energies of reaction (ΔGrxn) for the [Ln(NO3)]2+ complexes
calculated with CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3, MP2-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3, CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCVTZ-DK3,
MP2-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3, CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3, and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3.

To assess the chemical accuracy
of the computational methods used,
the differences of the predicted ΔGrxn with each method are compared among the options studied. Accuracy
between the MP2 and CCSD(T) methods is shown by comparing the difference
in the predicted ΔGrxn, calculated
with the CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3 and MP2-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3 along with
the difference between predicted ΔGrxn with CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3 and MP2-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3.
Throughout the lanthanoid series, the differences in predicted ΔGrxn between MP2-FSI and CCSD(T)-FSI are all
under 15 kcal mol–1, except for [Nd(NO3)]2+, [Er(NO3)]2+, and [Yb(NO3)]2+ compounds, where the difference in predicted
ΔGrxn is 40.0, 21.8, and 50.5 kcal
mol–1, respectively. Using the cc-pVTZ-DK3 and cc-pV∞Z-DK3,
basis sets show little effect in the difference in predicted ΔGrxn between MP2-FSI and CCSD(T)-FSI except for
[Nd(NO3)]2+ and [Er(NO3)]2+ for which utilizing the cc-pV∞Z-DK3 basis set showed a decrease
of 13.5 and 8.0 kcal mol–1, respectively.

The predicted ΔGrxn obtained
with CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3 and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pCVTZ-DK3 are compared
with those calculated with CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3 and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3
to show the effects of outer-core electron correlation to the predicted
ΔGrxn. These effects on the predicted
ΔGrxn are under 10 kcal mol–1 throughout the lanthanoid series with [Nd(NO3)]2+ and [Er(NO3)]2+ being
the only compounds for which the difference is over 10 kcal mol–1. The differences in ΔGrxn between considering an FSI and FSII level at the CBS limit
and at the triple-ζ basis set level were similar except for
[Nd(NO3)]2+ and [Er(NO3)]2+, where predicted ΔGrxn from the
CBS limit decrease by 11.5 and 5.9 kcal mol–1, respectively.

Overall, all of the ab initio methods predict the same binding
trends for the [Ln(NO3)]2+ complexes throughout
the series, except for Nd with CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3 and CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3
which show a slight increase (of about 5 kcal mol–1) to the ΔGrxn from [Pr(NO3)]2+ to [Nd(NO3)]2+, whereas
all other methods show a decrease of about 20 kcal mol–1.

Throughout the lanthanoid series, the lanthanoid in the [Ln(NO3)]2+ compound has been shown to have an Ln IV configuration
except for Yb in which the predicted ground state has a Yb III configuration,
where Yb has a fully occupied 4f shell (instead of a partly filled
shell with 13 f electrons as in the Yb IV configuration). Because
the Yb 4f shell is closed in this configuration, the open shell electron
is in an N–O orbital. All of the computational methods tested
for the proposed system in this study predict Yb III to be lower in
energy except with CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pVTZ-DK3 which predicts the Yb IV
configuration to be 2.1 kcal mol–1 higher in energy
than Yb III configuration. The CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCVTZ-DK3 and CCSD(T)-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3
methods predict the Yb III configuration to be 1.1 and 4.5 kcal mol–1 lower, respectively. The target method, CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3,
shows that the Yb III configuration is more stable by 9.6 kcal mol–1. The MP2 methods show a wider gap between the two
configurations, where MP2-FSI/cc-pVTZ and MP2-FSI/cc-pV∞Z-DK3
show that the Yb III configuration is more stable by having a lower
energy by 52.0 and 59.9 kcal mol–1, respectively.
A recent study on [An(NO3)]2+ compounds where
An = Ac–Lr has also shown a ground state of an An III configuration
instead of a An IV configuration for Fm, Md, and No atoms in the gas
phase (but Fm IV and Md IV in the aqueous phase).6

Composite Results
The ΔGrxn for [La(NO3)]2+, [Ce(NO3)]2+, [Pr(NO3)]2+, [Sm(NO3)]2+, and [Lu(NO3)]2+ is calculated
with the composite methods described
in eq 4 (f-ccCA), eq 5 (method
A), and eq 6 (method
B). Table 2 shows the
difference between the predicted ΔGrxn calculated with the f-ccCA method and the target
method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3+SO]. In this case, the target
method contains an SO correction calculated as indicated in the ΔEspin33 correction
included in f-ccCA.9 The
difference between the predicted ΔGrxn calculated utilizing the f-ccCA method (for the
enthalpy calculation) and the target method is shown to be small,
between 0.10 and 1.21 kcal mol–1 throughout the
[La(NO3)]2+, [Ce(NO3)]2+, [Pr(NO3)]2+, [Sm(NO3)]2+, and [Lu(NO3)]2+ compounds tested. The breakdown
of the contribution to the predicted energy with f-ccCA and with the target methodology is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Predicted ΔGrxn for [Ln(NO3)]2+ calculated
with f-ccCA and
target method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3 + SO]. The contribution
from each term in the f-ccCA formulation [Eref, Eref + ΔEcc, Eref + ΔEcc + ΔEcv,
and Eref + ΔEcc + ΔEcv + ΔEspin] is also shown. The relative computational
cost and difference in predicted ΔGrxn calculated with f-ccCA and the target method is
shown in the table (inset). [Relative computational cost is shown
as a percentage and it is calculated as relative cost = (CPU units
with f-ccCA)/(CPU units with target method) ×
100; Δ(ΔG)rxn = ΔGrxn(f-ccCA) – ΔGrxn(target method)].

× 100; Δ(ΔG)rxn = ΔGrxn(method A or B) – ΔGrxn(CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3).

Moreover, the SO contribution to
the overall ΔGrxn, as described
by the ΔEspin term in f-ccCA, is found to be very small,
under 0.49 kcal mol–1, except for [Pr(NO3)]2+, where this contribution is predicted to be 3.8 kcal
mol–1. The predicted ΔGrxn obtained with the composite methods A and B does not include
corrections for SO coupling because it was shown that the SO correction
for the reaction proposed in eq 1 is under 3 kcal mol–1 and therefore, incurring
the additional computational cost for adding this term for the reaction
was unnecessary. In method A, the reference energy is obtained at
the MP2-FSI level; a higher dynamic electronic correlation term, ΔEcc, is added to the CCSD(T)-FSI level; an additional
outer-core electron correlation term, ΔEcv, is obtained at the CCSD(T)-FSII level, which is similar
to f-ccCA except for the inclusion of SO effects.
For the composite method B, the ΔEcc term is removed and the reference energy is computed at the CCSD(T)-FSI
level which does not affect the ΔEcv term with CCSD(T)-FSII. Predicted ΔGrxn calculated with method A and method B is shown in Figure 3 for all of the lanthanoid
compounds which shows a similar trend between ΔGrxn and the target method, CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3
(without SO), across the lanthanoid series.

Figure 3 Predicted ΔGrxn for [Ln(NO3)]2+ calculated
with composite method A (eq 5) and method B (eq 6), along with the target
method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3].

The predicted ΔGrxn with f-ccCA (eq 4) is within 2 kcal mol–1 from the ΔGrxn predicted with the target (CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3+SO)
except for [Nd(NO3)]2+ where the difference
is 8.6 kcal mol–1. The difference between the predicted
ΔGrxn calculated with the composite
methods from method A (eq 5) and B (eq 6) are shown
to be small, under 1 kcal mol–1 in most of the systems,
and between 3 and 13 kcal mol–1 for [Nd(NO3)]2+, [Ho(NO3)]2+, [Er(NO3)]2+, and [Tm(NO3)]2+. The difference
between the predicted ΔGrxn calculated
with the composite methods described by f-ccCA (eq 4) with CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3+SO
and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3 (target method for f-ccCA, method A and method B, respectively) are shown in the Supporting Information in Table S2.

The f-ccCA method shows a relative computational
cost between 12 and 23% for prediction of the ΔGrxn of the [Ln(NO3)]2+ compounds
over the target method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3+SO], as
shown in Figure 2.
The impact to the predicted ΔGrxn is shown to be less than 1.5 kcal mol–1 from using f-ccCA. As expected, because composite method A has a reference
energy computed with MP2, instead of CCSD(T), it has a lower computational
cost than that when calculated with method B. Furthermore, the cost
is lower (compared to the target method) for method A than for method
B with less than a kcal mol–1 difference in the
predicted ΔGrxn (as shown in Table 2).

Evaluation of
Method A and Method B for [Ln(NO3)]2+ and [Ln(OH)]2+ Compounds
The predicted Gibbs free energy of reaction
for Ln(NO3)]2+ with method A is within 0.10
and 8.59 kcal mol–1 from those predicted by the
target method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3].
With method B, this difference is between 0.05 and 5.47 kcal mol–1. With method A, the predicted Gibbs free energy of
reaction calculated for [La(NO3)]2+ is 0.10
kcal mol–1 higher than predicted with the target
method, 0.52 kcal mol–1 lower for Ce(NO3)]2+, 0.25 kcal mol–1 lower for [Pr(NO3)]2+, 8.59 kcal mol–1 higher
for [Nd(NO3)]2+, 1.21 kcal mol–1 higher for [Sm(NO3)]2+, 0.29 kcal mol–1 lower for [Eu(NO3)]2+, 0.21
kcal mol–1 lower for Gd(NO3)]2+, 0.10 kcal mol–1 lower for Tb(NO3)]2+, 0.65 kcal mol–1 higher for Dy(NO3)]2+, 3.24 kcal mol–1 higher
for [Ho(NO3)]2+, 4.97 kcal mol–1 higher for [Er(NO3)]2+, 2.30 kcal mol–1 higher for [Tm(NO3)]2+, 5.11
kcal mol–1 higher for [Yb(NO3)]2+, and 0.44 kcal mol–1 lower for [Lu(NO3)]2+. Comparably, with method B, the predicted Gibbs free
energy of reaction calculated for [La(NO3)]2+ is 0.32 kcal mol–1 higher than predicted with
the target method, 0.44 kcal mol–1 lower for [Ce(NO3)]2+, 2.47 kcal mol–1 lower for

Comparison of Method A
and Method B
A direct comparison of predicted Gibbs free
energies of reaction
calculated with method A and method B is performed for [Ln(NO3)]2+ and [Ln(OH)]2+ (with Ln = La, Ce,
Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Tm, Yb, and Lu). Although the complete lanthanoid
series is evaluated with method A and method B for [Ln(NO3)]2+, only compounds with La, Ce, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Tm,
Yb, and Lu are included in this discussion because of [Ln(OH)]2+ with Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, Ho, and Er being unavailable.

When considering all compounds included in this evaluation, on
average method A and method B predict Gibbs free energies of reaction
1.73 and 0.89 kcal mol–1 from those calculated with
the target method [CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3], respectively.
The range with method B is approximately 2 kcal mol–1 smaller than that with method A (with method A predicting Gibbs
free energies of reaction between 0.10 and 1.73 kcal mol–1 from the target method, and method B between 0.05 and 5.47 kcal
mol–1), as shown in Table 5.

Method B predicts Gibbs
free energies of reaction within 1.4 kcal
mol–1 from those predicted with the target method
for all compounds in this analysis except for [Yb(NO3)]2+ and [Ce(OH)]2+ with differences of 5.47 and 4.57
kcal mol–1. For the same compounds, method A predicts
Gibbs free energies of reaction within 4.3 kcal mol–1, except for [Yb(NO3)]2+ and Ce(OH)]2+ for which the differences are 5.1 and 7.5 kcal mol–1, respectively. Absolute differences are shown in Table 5.

In general, Gibbs free
energies of reaction calculated with method
B are closer to those predicted with the target method than when calculated
with method A, as shown in Table 5, Figures 6, and 7. Also, the predicted Gibbs
free energies of reaction calculated with method B are often higher
than those predicted with the target method, whereas those predicted
with method A are often lower than those predicted by the target method.
As shown in Figure 6, the predicted Gibbs free energy of reaction of [Ln(NO3)]2+ calculated with method A is less than 0.65 kcal mol–1 for all compounds in this analysis except for [Tm(NO3)]2+ and [Yb(NO3)]2+, which
have a predicted energy 2.30 and 5.11 kcal mol–1 higher than the target method, respectively, whereas with method
B the predicted Gibbs free energies are all within 0.56 kcal mol–1 from those predicted with the target method except
for [Tm(NO3)]2+ and [Yb(NO3)]2+ which have a predicted energy 1.38 kcal mol–1 lower and 5.47 kcal mol–1 higher than the target
method, respectively. The Gibbs free energy of reaction of the [Ln(OH)]2+ compounds calculated with method A is between 0.80 and 7.54
kcal mol–1 higher than those predicted with the
target method, whereas when calculated with method B, all predicted
Gibbs free energies are within 0.79 kcal mol–1 from
those predicted by the target method, except for [Ce(NO3)]2+ with a predicted ΔGrxn 4.57 kcal mol–1 lower than predicted by the target
method. All values are shown in Figures 6 and 7.

Conclusions
Computational predictive capabilities are essential
to optimize
the design of ligands for selective binding of lanthanoids. In particular,
cost-efficient methods are critical for industrial applications, as
processes at industrial scales can greatly benefit from robust and
efficient computational protocols. In this study, the Gibbs free energy
of reaction of a nitrate ion bound to lanthanoid ions is calculated
with ab initio methods including CCSD(T) and composites. Finding computationally
efficient methods for predictive capabilities of nitrate ligands bound
to lanthanoids is essential because of the importance of nitric acid
use in the separation process and subsequent nitrate complexation
to lanthanoids.

The SO contribution to the proposed reaction
is small (less than
0.45 kcal mol–1) for the compounds tested, and therefore
found unnecessary in the evaluation of the Gibbs free energy in the
studied binding reaction. All lanthanoid ions in this study presented
a behavior corresponding to an Ln IV configuration except for Yb,
which presented a Yb III configuration similar to No in previous studies
of actinoid nitrate systems (following the NIST nomenclature indicated
in Table 1). The effects
of higher electron correlation beyond MP2 ranges from 2 to 50 kcal
mol–1 through the lanthanoid series, whereas the
effects of outer-core correlation are less than 10 kcal mol–1 (except for Nd and Eu, where it is 24.6 and 7.2 kcal mol–1, respectively). All composites included in this study predict Gibbs
free energies of reaction within approximately 3 kcal mol–1 from each other at a fraction of the cost of the target methodology
[CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3 for method A and B, and CCSD(T)-FSII/cc-pwCV∞Z-DK3+SO
for f-ccCA]. The composite method A [where Eref is described by MP2] predicts Gibbs free
energies of reaction between 0.09 and 8.59 kcal mol–1 from those predicted by the target method at a computational cost
between 10 and 32% of the target method. The Gibbs free energy predicted
utilizing f-ccCA between 0.11 and 1.21 kcal mol–1 from those predicted by the target method at a computational
cost between 12 and 23% of the target method. The Gibbs free energy
of reaction predicted with the composite method B (where Eref is described by CCSD(T)) is between 0.05 and 5.47
kcal mol–1 from those predicted by the target method
at a computational cost between 22 and 70% of the target method.

This study provides options for ab initio methods that can predict
Gibbs free energies of reaction for the binding of nitrates to lanthanoids
at a lower computational cost than CCSD(T). Although the focus of
the study is on [Ln(NO3)]2+, the proposed method
A and method B are also evaluated on [Ln(OH)]2+, showing
promising future extensions of these methods to other lanthanoid-containing
compounds. Future work will include expanding the application of these
methods to fully complexed systems of interest in separation technologies.
