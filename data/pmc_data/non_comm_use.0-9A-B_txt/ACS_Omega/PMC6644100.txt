The dicopper(II) complex of the bimacrocyclic
ligand α,α′-bis(5,7-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecan-6-yl)-o-xylene, 2, interacts with selected anions
in dimethyl sulfoxide solution according to two different modes: (i)
halides (Cl–, Br–, and I–) and N3– coordinate the two metal centers
at the same time between the two macrocyclic subunits that face each
other and (ii) anionic species that do not fit the bridging coordination
mode (e.g., NCO–, SCN–, CH3COO–, NO3–,
and H2PO4–) interact with
copper(II) ions only at the “external” positions or
their interaction is too weak to be detected. Occurrence of the bridging
interaction is demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic studies performed
on the adduct formed by [Cu2(2)]4+ with azide and by electron paramagnetic resonance investigation,
as the anion coordination between the two copper(II) centers induces
spin–spin coupling. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments
performed on [Cu2(2)]4+ and, for
comparison, on [(5,7-dimethyl-6-benzyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane)copper(II)],
representing the mononuclear analogue, allowed determination of thermodynamic
parameters (log K, ΔH, and TΔS) associated with the considered
complex/anion equilibria. Thermodynamic data showed that adducts formed
by [Cu2(2)]4+ with halides and
azide benefit from an extra stability that can be explained on the
basis of the anion advantage of simultaneously binding the two metal
centers, i.e., in terms of the bimacrocyclic effect.

Introduction
Anion recognition is
a well-established research topic, still attracting
much interest in the field of supramolecular chemistry.1 Starting from the pioneering studies carried
out on cage-shaped receptors by Park & Simmons1a and Lehn,1b a very large number
of artificial receptors and chemosensors for anionic species have
been designed and investigated.2 The recognition
process can be based on a variety of host–guest interactions,
including coordinative ones.3 Metal–ligand
interactions have been used in efficient anion receptors that include
complexes with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers; this often
results in very strong binding of guest anions at these open positions.
Moreover, the better-defined directional character of metal–ligand
bonds (particularly if compared to electrostatic interactions) may
impose geometrical constraints that contribute to increasing recognition
selectivity.4 Several examples of metal
complexes applied in the recognition of anionic species have also
been described as “cascade” receptors.3a−3c Metal complexes of polyamines, either linear or branched (e.g.,
tren), can be conveniently used as binding subunits in the design
of anion receptors and chemosensors,5 although
they are usually labile and can undergo demetalation in the presence
of excess anions or under acidic conditions (due to the protonation
of the amine groups). On the contrary, cyclic amines and particularly
cyclam-like ligands form inert complexes (e.g., with CuII and NiII) that do not undergo demetalation even under
severe conditions, such as in strongly acidic solutions (e.g., a lifetime
of 30 years has been evaluated for [Ni(cyclam)]2+ in 1
M aqueous HClO4).6

The
coordination chemistry of dinuclear complexes, particularly
of systems containing two transition metal ions separated by a relatively
short distance (3.5–7.0 Å), has also attracted much interest
during the last decades because of their involvement in a variety
of biochemical and industrial processes.7 The presence of two metal ions at a suitable distance can favor
the coordination of small molecules, anions, and/or organic substrates
and grant catalytic activity for certain reactions, for example, reduction
of CO28 and O2.9

In particular, octaamine 2 represents an interesting
example of bimacrocyclic ligand, consisting of two dimethyl-cyclam
subunits in a trans-III conformation, bridged by an ortho-xylyl group.
Both methyl groups on each cyclam ring are in the equatorial position
with respect to the chair conformation of the six-membered chelate
rings, causing an axial orientation of the xylylene group and consequently
favoring the face-to-face arrangement of the two macrocyclic subunits.10 The corresponding dinuclear complexes are able
to combine the high inertness toward demetalation of the cyclam-like
analogues with the capability of the pincer-like structure to chelate
anions between the two metal centers.10,11

The
dinickel(II) complex of ligand 2 was studied in
the solid state by Endicott and co-workers,11 who demonstrated that it shows an extreme versatility in the magnetic
behavior, depending on the nature of the anion bound between the two
facing metallocyclam subunits. Recently, we have studied the interaction
of [Ni2(2)]4+ with halides and
pseudohalides (azide, cyanate, and thiocyanate) in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO).12Figure 1 shows the possible positions where the anions
can be coordinated by the dinuclear complex. Our spectrophotometric
and voltammetric studies disclosed two main behavior modes: (i) pseudohalides
preferentially interact outside the intermetallic cavity of the bimacrocyclic
complex, benefiting from coordination to the metal ion of the dinuclear
complex to the same extent as the analogous mononuclear species, [Ni(1)]2+ and (ii) halides benefit from coordination
to a greater extent when they bind the dinuclear complex because they
are included in the intermetallic cavity and interact with two metal
centers at the same time. We previously defined the “bimacrocyclic
effect”12 as the extra-stability
displayed by complex/anion adducts in which anionic guests occupy
the space between the two macrocyclic subunits, when compared to the
adduct with the related mononuclear complex.

Figure 1 Schematic representation
of the face-to-face structural arrangement
adopted by dinuclear complexes of 2. Anions could be
coordinated simultaneously by two metal centers (inner position, green
dashed circle) and/or by one metal ion (outer positions, blue dashed
circles), the latter being equivalent to binding to a mononuclear
complex.

Recently, we have also investigated
the interaction of the di-copper
complex of ligand 2, [Cu2(2)]4+, with selected anions in water, observing a substantial
lack of selectivity in the recognition process. In particular, the
examination of enthalpy and entropy terms, which were unbalanced or
contrasting, disclosed that the contributions due to hydration/dehydration
processes overcame any favorable effect because of the nature of the
receptor (e.g., steric complementarity).13

Given the relevance of this result for a correct comprehension
of the anion recognition process, we decided to investigate the interaction
between [Cu2(2)]4+ and different
anions in nonaqueous media, in order to confirm (or not) the major
role of solvation/desolvation processes in solvents other than water.
The study, performed in comparison with the mononuclear analogue,
[Cu(1)]2+, was restricted to DMSO solutions
because of the poor solubility of the dinuclear complex in less polar
solvents (e.g., MeCN, alcohols). In addition, we aimed to confirm
the existence of a possible bimacrocyclic effect even in the complex/anion
adducts formed by [Cu2(2)]4+ as
previously observed for the analogous dinickel species.

Hence,
we report the results obtained by using a range of experimental
techniques according to the receptor-substrate approach. In particular,
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments and UV–vis
spectrophotometric titrations provided information about stability
of complex/anion adducts and related thermodynamic parameters (log K, ΔH, and TΔS), while electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements
indicated the bridged or nonbridged nature of adducts. In fact, owing
to copper(II) one-electron paramagnetism, complex [Cu2(2)]4+ could favor spin–spin coupling between
its two copper centers in the presence of coordinated bridging anions,
allowing to shed light on the mechanism of the anion–dinuclear
complex interaction. Ligand-mediated spin–spin coupling processes
have been previously investigated in different dinuclear complexes.14 Moreover, a direct insight on the solid-state
structural features of receptor/anion adducts is provided by X-ray
crystallographic studies performed on the complex formed by [Cu2(2)]4+ with azide.

Results and Discussion
EPR Studies
EPR spectra were measured on frozen DMSO
(120 K) solutions of [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 and [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 in the presence of increasing amounts (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 7 equiv)
of different anions (chloride, bromide, iodide, azide, cyanate, and
acetate) that were added as the corresponding tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts. Collected data are summarized in Table 1.

peaks = 2NI + 1 (N, number of equivalent
nuclei
felt by the electron; I, nuclear spin quantum number).

b Two groups of four overlapped
lines.

c Two groups of seven
lines where
four of them are overlapped.

The spectrum of [Cu(1)]2+ shows the typical
four-line pattern in the parallel region (Figure 2a) expected for coupling of one electron
with the 3/2 spin of a copper(II) nucleus (2NI +
1 = 4, where N is the number of equivalent nuclei
felt by the electron and I is the nuclear spin quantum
number). The spectrum of [Cu2(2)]4+ also displays a four-line pattern (Figure 2b,c) because the two Cu2+ nuclei
are not in communication with each other, thus each unpaired electron
feels only one copper center, developing two overlapped groups of
four lines.

Figure 2 Experimental EPR spectra of a solution of (a) [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 (5 × 10–4 M)
with increasing amounts of Br–, (b) a solution of
[Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 (5 ×
10–4 M) with increasing amounts of Br–, and (c) with increasing amounts of NCO–.

The mononuclear complex still
displays the four-line pattern when
increasing amounts (0.5, 1, 2, 7 equiv) of any investigated anions
are added. Spectra recorded on the solution of [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 with different amounts of bromide are shown
in Figure 2a, whereas
spectra obtained in the presence of other anions are reported in Figure
S1 (Supporting Information). The EPR spectrum
of the dinuclear complex is only slightly affected by the presence
of cyanate and acetate (see Figures 2c and S2), whereas chloride,
bromide, iodide, and azide make the spectrum assume the typical aspect
of a triplet state, in which the metal–metal interaction is
much greater than the hyperfine interaction, and the value of AII is about half of that of the mononuclear
complex, indicating a delocalization of the unpaired electrons (S = 1/2) over two equivalent copper centers. Spectra recorded
on a frozen DMSO solution of [Cu2(2)]4+ with different amounts of bromide are shown in Figure 2b, whereas spectra
concerning other anions are reported in Figure S2. The spectra of [Cu2(2)]4+ measured in the presence of anions that mediate the metal–metal
interaction consist of two septuplets (2NI + 1 =
2 × 2 × 3/2 + 1 = 7), but just 10 lines can be identified
instead of the expected 14 because 5 of them fall very close to each
other and are indistinguishable (Figure 2b). The barycenter of the two septuplets
is separated by a value of 2DII.

It should be noted that the addition of 0.5 equiv of chloride,
bromide, or iodide, is enough to induce a change in the spectrum of
the dicopper(II) complex, indicating that the first anion is coordinated
between the two metal centers, bringing them closer and acting as
a bridge, thus inducing spin–spin coupling. In the case of
azide, the spin–spin coupling can be first noticed after the
addition of 2 equiv of anion and may be due to a weaker interaction
(see the next section for the stability constants of the bimacrocyclic
complex/anion adducts). In the presence of large excess of halides
and azide (7 equiv), the 10 lines are still visible in the EPR spectra,
which indicate that the anion still remains inside the cavity and
enables the spin–spin coupling. Cyanate and acetate do not
induce any metal–metal interaction (see spectra in Figures 2c and S2, respectively), suggesting that they are coordinated
only at the external positions of the bimacrocyclic complex.

Calorimetric
Studies
Studies of the anion-binding properties
of complex species [Cu(1)]2+ and [Cu2(2)]4+ in pure DMSO were performed by ITC.
In a typical experiment, a solution of the envisaged complex in DMSO
was titrated by a solution of the investigated anion dissolved in
the same solvent as (TBA)X salt (X = Cl–, Br–, I–, N3–, NCO–, CH3COO–, SCN–, and NO3–). No heat effect
was observed during the ITC titrations performed on both mono- and
dinuclear complexes with NCS– and NO3–, suggesting that the interaction with these anionic
species is too weak to be detected. Figure 3 reports the thermograms and the ITC profiles
(obtained by AFFINImeter software)15 corresponding
to the ITC titration of [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 with Cl–, Br–, N3–, and NCO– (data for
titration with I– and CH3COO– are shown in Figure S3).

Figure 3 Thermograms and corresponding
ITC profiles taken over the course
of the titration experiments in DMSO: (a) [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 (1.0 × 10–3 M) titrated
with (TBA)Cl (3.0 × 10–2 M); (b) [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 (5.1 × 10–3 M) titrated with (TBA)Br (1.4 × 10–1 M);
(c) [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 (5.8 ×
10–3 M) titrated with (TBA)N3 (1.1 ×
10–1 M); (d) [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 (5.8 × 10–3 M) titrated with
(TBA)NCO (1.1 × 10–1 M). Circles: experimental
data; line: fitting profile (sequential two-site models for (a,b,
and d); one-site model for (c); “receptor” complex in
the cell); T = 25 °C.

[Cu(1)]2+ can coordinate the first
equivalent
of anion (1:1 adduct) according to a square-pyramidal geometry, binding
the anion in the axial position. Sequentially, the mononuclear complex
can coordinate the second equivalent of anion (1:2 complex) exploiting
an elongated octahedral geometry, with both anions in an axial position,
one anion for each side (Figure S4). In
the cases of Cl–, Br–, NCO–, and CH3COO–, we obtained
the best fitting by assuming the occurrence of two stepwise equilibria,
corresponding to the formation of 1:1 (eq 1) and 1:2 (eq 2) complex/anion adducts. 1   2    

Concerning I– and N3–, the best fitting of the titration data was obtained
by assuming
the occurrence of only one equilibrium, corresponding to the formation
of 1:1 complex species. Although the binding of two anions even for
I– and N3– cannot be
ruled out, no experimental evidence was obtained for the formation
of 1:2 adducts with these anions, i.e., the corresponding stability
constant values could be too small to be experimentally determined.

Thermograms and ITC profiles corresponding to the titrations of
[Cu2(2)]4+ with Cl–, Br–, N3–, and NCO– are reported in Figure 4, whereas data concerning titration with I– and CH3COO– are reported in Figure S5. It should be noted that some of the
presented ITC titrations were run with nonconstant additions of a
titrant in order to cover a large range of titrant equivalents, while
at the same time achieving sufficient resolution in the low [anion]/[complex]
region at the beginning of the experiments. Changes in the volume
of titrant additions result in visible “spikes” in the
corresponding power plots.

course of the titration
of a solution of [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 (1.0 × 10–3 M) in DMSO with a solution
of (a) (TBA)Cl (3.0 × 10–2 M); (b) (TBA)Br
(3.0 × 10–2 M); (c) (TBA)N3 (5.0
× 10–2 M); and (d) (TBA)NCO (3.7 × 10–2 M). Circles: experimental data; line: fitting profile
(sequential two-site models for (a, b, and d); one-site model for

Considering the titration
with (TBA)N3, the best fitting
of the data can be obtained by assuming the occurrence of one equilibrium
corresponding to the formation of a 1:1 complex. On the other hand,
when the bimacrocyclic complex is titrated with Cl–, Br–, I–, NCO–, and CH3COO–, the occurrence of two
stepwise equilibria (eqs 3 and 4) has to be assumed in order to obtain
adequate fitting of the titration data. 3   4    

Differently
from the behavior of the di-nickel complex [Ni2(2)]4+ that coordinates up to 3 equiv
of anion,12 the analogous di-copper complex
interacts in solution with no more than 2 equiv of anionic ligands.

On the basis of EPR and ITC measurements, the geometrical aspects
of the equilibria taking place during the titrations of [Cu2(2)]4+ with the investigated anions in DMSO
solution can be hypothesized. They are schematically summarized in Figure 5. The dicopper(II)
complex can coordinate anionic species according to two distinct pathways:(a) the first
anion occupies the inner
position between the two macrocyclic subunits, binding two metal centers
at the same time (equilibrium 1a in Figure 5), giving rise to a square-pyramidal arrangement
for both copper(II) ions and providing a spin–spin coupling
as shown by EPR measurements; then, a second equivalent of anion can
be coordinated at one of the two equivalent “external”
positions of the dinuclear complex (equilibrium 1b in Figure 5), inducing one copper(II)
ion to assume an elongated octahedral geometry and preserving the
spin–spin coupling;

(b) both the first and the second equivalent
of anion interact with [Cu2(2)]4+ at the “external” positions (equilibria 2a and 2b
in Figure 5); each
metal ion assumes a square-pyramidal positions without inducing any
spin–spin coupling.



Figure 5 Schematic representation
of the equilibria involved over the course
of the titration of [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 with (i) bridging anions (X–, green
spheres = Cl–, Br–, I–, and N3–), which permit the spin–spin
coupling between the two copper centers and (ii) nonbridging anions
(Y–, blue spheres = NCO–, and
CH3COO–).

Taking into account the experimental data and referring to
the
equilibria depicted in Figure 5, azide interacts with [Cu2(2)]4+ according to equilibrium 1a, chloride, bromide, and iodide
according to equilibria 1a and 2a, and cyanate and acetate according
to equilibria 1b and 2b.

The thermodynamic quantities (log K, ΔH, and TΔS) at 25
°C determined by fitting the data obtained during titrations
of [Cu(1)]2+ and [Cu2(2)]4+ with the considered anions are collected in Table 2. Log K1 values observed for the interaction of the mononuclear
complex with the investigated anions (eq 1) and related to the stability of [Cu(1)X]+ species roughly fall in the 2.0–3.5 range.
The experimental affinity sequence is the following:

When the same anionic species are considered, higher equilibrium
constants (log K1 for eq 3) are generally observed for the
dinuclear complex than for the mononuclear analogue. This could be
expected on the basis of the larger positive charge of [Cu2(2)]4+ than [Cu(1)]2+ and also by taking into account the statistical effect in favor
of the dicopper(II) complex. Nevertheless, the stability increase
of [Cu2(2)X]3+ when compared to
[Cu(1)X]+ depends on the anion, it being larger
in the case of halides (about 2 order of magnitude) than for azide,
acetate, and cyanate (about 0.6–0.7 order of magnitude, see Table 2 and Figure S6). As a consequence, the affinity sequence of the
dinuclear complex significantly differs from that observed for the
mononuclear analogue:  

In particular,
all halides take the leading positions in the affinity
sequence of [Cu2(2)]4+, with bromide
overtaking acetate and with cyanate and iodide overtaking azide too.
These relevant changes in the affinity of copper(II) bimacrocyclic
complex toward anions can be related to the ability of halides to
interact with the dinuclear species according to a bridging coordination
mode, differently from acetate and cyanate. Therefore, the extra stability
displayed by the adducts formed by [Cu2(2)]4+ in the presence of Cl–, Br–, or I– can be explained on the basis of an advantage
for the anion in occupying the space between the two metal centers,
thus confirming the existence of the bimacrocyclic effect. Quite surprisingly,
azide, which according to EPR data also interacts with [Cu2(2)]4+ by bridging the two copper(II) macrocyclic
subunits, seems not to benefit from the bimacrocyclic effect as much
as halides do. In fact, the stability increase of [Cu2(2)N3]3+ when compared to [Cu(1)N3]+ (Δ log K1 = 0.68) is quite comparable to that observed for the analogue adducts
of acetate and cyanate (Δ log K1 = 0.61 and 0.72, respectively), which are bound only at the “external”
coordination positions. It should be noted that, when anions are bound
between the two macrocyclic subunits, a rearrangement of the receptor
is needed in order to achieve the anion chelation, as also shown by
the crystallographic data (see below). These rearrangements may be
energetically more costly for azide than for halides; in fact, more
substantial conformational changes may be necessary to generate a
binding cavity between the two cyclam rings that will not only fit
the triatomic azide but also accommodate the geometry imposed by the
hybridization of the terminal N donor atoms. As a consequence, the
overall stability of [Cu2(2)N3]3+ and the associated bimacrocyclic effect are significantly
reduced.

When the interaction of [Cu2(2)X]3+ with a second equivalent of anion (eq 4) is considered, interestingly,
stability constants
(i.e., log K2 values) are very close to
those measured for the formation of the corresponding adducts formed
by [Cu(1)]2+ (i.e., log K1 for [Cu(1)X]+ see Table2 and Figure S7). This is in agreement with the hypothesis that a second
anion interacts with the dicopper(II) complex in the same way that
the first equivalent of anion interacts with the model mononuclear
system.

All interactions between the investigated anions and
both copper(II)
complexes are characterized by favorable entropy contributions (see Table 2). This result is
consistent with the consideration that the reagents are more solvated
than the products because the overall charge of the adducts decreases
upon anion coordination (see eqs 1 and 3) and, in addition, the complex/anion
interaction decreases the surface available for the solvent interaction.
In the case of anions that are coordinated according to a bridged
mode (Cl–, Br–, I–, and N3–) by [Cu2(2)]4+, TΔS1 values are distinctly larger than the corresponding TΔS term obtained for the mononuclear
complex. On the contrary, equilibria involving acetate and cyanate
are characterized by TΔS1 values that are very similar between mono- and dinuclear
complexes (see Table 2 and Figure S8). This indicates that coordination
of anionic guest in the space between the two macrocyclic subunits
induces a more pronounced anion desolvation with a consequent larger
entropy contribution, in agreement with what was previously observed
in water.13

All enthalpy contributions
concerning interactions of both complexes
with chloride, bromide, iodide, and azide have positive values. It
suggests that exothermic contributions related to the formation of
CuII–X–CuII coordinative interactions
are exceeded by the contrasting endothermic contributions mainly because
of (i) desolvation of the anionic guests and the receptor and (ii)
rearrangement of the bimacrocyclic receptor toward a face-to-face
structure taking place in order to interact with “bridging”
anions. On the contrary, negative enthalpy changes were observed in
the cases of cyanate and acetate (see Table 2 and Figure S9), which are always coordinated at the “external” positions
and do not require a structural modification of the bimacrocyclic
complex. However, it can be assumed that the overall endothermic character
observed in the interaction of [Cu2(2)]4+ with bridging anions is mainly due to a relevant contribution
of the receptor conformational rearrangement.

The examination
of enthalpy and entropy terms reported above suggests
that the extra stability that characterizes adducts formed by [Cu2(2)]4+ with “bridging anions”
(i.e., the bimacrocyclic effect) has a mainly entropic nature. It
also can be confirmed that solvation/desolvation processes play an
important role in the thermodynamics of anion–bimacrocyclic
complex interaction, although differently from what was previously
observed in water;13 in DMSO, these contributions
do not completely overshadow the effect because of structural nature
of the receptor. In fact, the general “compensatory effect”
(i.e., the TΔS/ΔH linear dependence) resulting from a prevalent contribution
of solvation/desolvation has not been observed in DMSO.

Spectrophotometric
Studies
The affinity toward anions
of both mono- and dicopper(II) complexes was also investigated through
spectrophotometric titration experiments. Solutions of [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 and [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 in DMSO were titrated with standard
solutions of the TBA+ salts of the investigated anions
(Cl–, Br–, I–, N3–, NCO–, CH3COO–, SCN–, and NO3–). The titration data were fitted by means
of a nonlinear least-squares program (HypSpec),16 in order to identify the species present at the equilibrium
and to obtain the association constants (see Table S1 and Figures S10–S12).

Although some stability constants cannot be determined by spectrophotometric
titrations because of unreliable data fittings, the results obtained
by UV–vis titrations are generally in good agreement with those
found by ITC experiments (see Tables 2 and S1). In particular,
when the interaction with “bridging” anions is considered,
the differences between log K1 values
determined for [Cu2(2)]4+ and [Cu(1)]2+ are similar to those obtained by ITC experiments.
It confirms that the dicopper(II) complex, thanks to its “chelating”
ability, provides an extra stability (i.e., the bimacrocyclic effect)
to the adducts with anionic guests that fit the space between the
two macrocyclic subunits and coordinate the two copper(II) ions according
to the bridging mode.

X-ray Crystallography
The molecular
structure of the
[Cu2(2)N3]3+ molecular
cation present in the [Cu2(2)N3(ClO4)2](ClO4)·0.5(H2O) crystalline complex salt is shown in Figure 6. For comparison, the structure of [Cu2(2)Br]3+ is also reported.13 A plot showing thermal ellipsoids is drawn in
Figure S13 (see Supporting Information).

Figure 6 Simplified
sketches of the [Cu2(2)]4+ bimacrocyclic
complex interacting with azide (left) and
bromide (right) ions placed in the inner positions. Bond distances
(Å) and angles for the metal–anion interactions are reported
at the bottom. Additional perchlorate counterions (for the azide complex)
and bromide ions (for the bromide complex) completing the elongated
octahedral coordination for the CuII centers are not shown.

As expected, the two facing cyclam
moieties are arranged in a trans-III
(RRSS) configuration. The observed mean distances between copper ions
and secondary amine nitrogen atoms [CuII–Namine: 2.02(1) and 2.03(1) Å] are similar to that observed in the
corresponding bromide adduct13 and correspond
to that expected for a strain-free Cu–N bond in cyclam and
cyclam-like macrocycles.17 The two metal
centers are displaced by 0.13(1) and 0.15(1) Å from the equatorial
N4 best plane and point toward the inside of the receptor
cavity that contains the azide ion. The two observed CuII–Nazide distances are 2.31(1) and 2.30(1) Å,
whereas the CuII···CuII separation
is 6.14(1) Å. The axially elongated octahedral coordination arrangements
for both metal centers are completed by two O atoms of two perchlorate
groups, placed at rather long distances of 2.73(1) and 2.75(1) Å.

Differently from what we observed in the structure of the analogous
bromide adduct,13 in [Cu2(2)N3]3+ the coordination of azide in
the inner position between the two metal ions occurs through a significant
rearrangement of the bimacrocycle conformation. In fact, it loses
the Cs molecular symmetry observed in
the bromide adduct and originates a complex species lacking any molecular
symmetry. In this way, the chelation of azide by the dicopper(II)
complex originates two CuII–N–N bond angles
of 114(1)° and 137(1)° with respect to the two terminal
azide atoms (see Figure 6). Such an arrangement favors the bonding requirements of two nitrogen
atoms having a prevailing sp2 nature. As a result, the
nearly linear azide ligand is almost coplanar with the best plane
of the aromatic spacer and the angle between the azide molecular axis
and the C6 aromatic best plane is about 5°.

The structural differences from the analogous bromide adduct are
clearly evident when some specific features are considered: [Cu2(2)Br]3+ displays a shorter CuII···CuII separation [5.83(1) Å]
and the inner bromide promotes an almost linear bridging coordination
arrangement with a CuII–Br–CuII angle of 171.7(1)° (Figure 6).

In the solid state, copper(II) centers of
adjacent bimacrocyclic
units are not directly bridged by the perchlorate counterion. Instead,
the crystal is supported by weak NH···O and unconventional
CH···O interactions in which O atoms from the perchlorate
anions act as H-acceptors (Figure S14).

Conclusions
The dicopper(II) complex investigated in this
work, [Cu2(2)]4+, containing two
subunits of cyclam-like
copper(II) complex and an o-xylyl spacer, interacts
with selected anions (i) according to a bridging coordination mode
with the substrate that binds the two metal centers at the same time
between the two macrocyclic subunits that face each other or (ii)
by interacting with anions only at the “external” coordination
positions of copper(II) ions. The bridging coordination mode is demonstrated
by X-ray crystallographic data and by EPR experiments. In fact, bridged
anions (Cl–, Br–, I–, and N3–) force the two metal centers
within close proximity and induce spin–spin coupling. Determination
of stability constants and related thermodynamic parameters by UV–vis
and ITC titration experiments shows that, when anions are bound according
to the bridging mode, the corresponding 1:1 adducts are considerably
more stable than the corresponding 1:1 adducts formed by the monomacrocyclic
reference complex [Cu(1)]2+. This paper confirms
that the “chelation” of an anionic substrate by a bimacrocyclic
complex provides an extra stability to the resulting adduct, which
can be described as a “bimacrocyclic effect”, as previously
proposed for the analogous dinickel(II) complex. The observed extra
stability has mainly an entropic nature in the case of interaction
with halides. The adduct with azide also benefits from a favorable
entropic effect, but it is significantly mitigated by an enthalpic
disadvantage, which could be due to a more difficult host rearrangement
when compared to the analogous bridged halide species. The examination
of entropy and enthalpy terms points out that the contribution ascribed
to solvation/desolvation, which is prevalent in water, does not completely
overshadow the contribution of receptor structural features when the
anion–receptor interaction is studied in polar nonaqueous media.
In fact, the general “compensatory effect” observed
when the interaction of [Cu2(2)]4+ with anions was studied in water cannot be observed in DMSO.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures and Materials
Unless otherwise stated,
all reagents and solvents were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and used
as received. All TBA+ salts were of greater than 98% purity
and dried in vacuo overnight before use. DMSO (ACS reagent, ≥99.9%)
was purchased in small septum cap bottles (water content <0.005%)
and was properly handled to avoid as much as possible the absorption
of humidity from air. Mass spectra were acquired on a Thermo-Finnigan
ion-trap LCQ Advantage Max instrument equipped with an ESI source.
IR spectra were run on a PerkinElmer Spectrum X100 Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) instrument equipped with an attenuated total reflectance
(U-ATR) apparatus. UV–vis spectra were recorded using a Varian
Cary 50 or Cary 100 spectrophotometer with a quartz cuvette (path
length: 1 or 0.1 cm).

Synthesis of Copper(II) Complexes
[Cu(1)](ClO4)2 and [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 were prepared according
to a three-step
procedure: (i) synthesis of [Ni(1)](ClO4)218 and [Ni2(2)](ClO4)410,19 according
to previously reported procedures; (ii) demetalation of nickel(II)
complexes and isolation of free ligands 1(18) and 2;10 and (iii) reaction of free ligands 1 and 2 with Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O providing
mono- and dinuclear copper(II) complexes.

[(5,7-Dimethyl-6-benzyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane)-copper(II)]perchlorate,
[Cu(1)](ClO4)2
Free ligand 1 (0.06 g, 0,19 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of MeOH (10
mL) and aqueous 3 M HClO4 (1 mL), then excess Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.8 g, 2.2 mmol) was added.
The resulting solution was refluxed for 2 h and a purple precipitate
was formed. After cooling to room temperature, the purple powder was
collected by filtration and recrystallized from MeOH. Yield: 0.11
g (∼100%). MS (CH3OH, ESI): m/z 190.69 (100%, [CuII(1)]2+), 380.35 (20%, [CuII(1)–H+]+). UV–vis [DMSO, λmax nm (ε,
M–1 cm–1)]: 535 (98). FT-IR (cm–1): 3235, 2975, 2935, 2885, 1460, 1420, 1070, 980,
750, 620.

α,α′-Bis[(5,7-dimethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecan-6-yl)-copper(II)]-o-xylene perchlorate, [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4
Free ligand 2 (0.1 g,
0,18 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of MeOH (20 mL) and aqueous
3 M HClO4 (1 mL), then Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (1.5 g, 0.4 mmol) was added. The resulting solution was
refluxed for 2 h and, after cooling to room temperature, a purple-colored
precipitate was collected by filtration and recrystallized from MeOH.
Yield: 0.19 g (∼100%). MS (CH3OH, ESI): m/z 391.19 (100%, [Cu2II(2)–H+ + ClO4–]2+. UV–vis [DMSO, λmax nm (ε,
M–1 cm–1)]: 535 (231). FT-IR (cm–1): 3235, 2975, 2885, 1470, 1440, 1080, 1000, 980,
745, 620.

EPR Studies
The EPR spectra were
recorded at 120 K
and 31.81 mW microwave power with a field modulation amplitude of
5 G. The spectrometer was Bruker EMX-10/12 (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Karlsruhe,
Germany) operating in the X-band and equipped with a ER4119HS cavity
and temperature control. The spectral simulations were made using
the Bruker WinEPR Simfonia package.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
ITC titrations were
performed by using a nano ITC low-volume isothermal titration calorimeter
(TA instrument). All titrations were performed at 25 °C in DMSO
by adding the anionic titrants (DMSO solutions of TBA+ salts)
to the solution of the envisaged complex, placed in the instrument
sample cell. The association parameters (K, ΔH, and ΔS), as well as the interaction
stoichiometry, were determined by a fitting procedure using AFFINImeter
software.15 Blank titrations in DMSO were
performed and subtracted from the corresponding titrations with anions
to remove the effect of titrant dilution.

UV–Vis Spectrophotometry
UV–vis spectra
were recorded on a Varian CARY 50 spectrophotometer with a quartz
cuvette of 1 cm path length. UV–vis titrations were performed
at 25 °C on DMSO solutions of [Cu(1)](ClO4)2 and [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 (1 × 10–3 M), by adding aliquots
of freshly prepared standard solutions (in DMSO) of (TBA)X (X = Cl,
Br, I, NCO, NCS, N3, NO3, and CH3COO). Titration data were processed with HypSpec software (Hyperquad
suite) to determine the equilibrium constants.16 Best fitting of titration data was evaluated on the basis
of the χ2 value: accepted models showed χ2 values lower than 10 and rejected models showed χ2 > 50. The HySS program was used to obtain the distribution
diagrams of the species.20

X-ray Crystallographic
Study
Crystals of the complex
salt [Cu2(2)N3(ClO4)2](ClO4)·0.5(H2O), suitable for
crystallographic studies, were obtained by slow diffusion of EtOH
vapors in a 50:50 MeCN/H2O solution of [Cu2(2)](ClO4)4 in the presence of excess
NaN3. Diffraction data for the [Cu2(2)N3(ClO4)2](ClO4)·0.5(H2O) (violet, prismatic, 0.30 × 0.16 × 0.10 mm3) crystal were collected by means of a Bruker AXS CCD-based
three-circle diffractometer, working at ambient temperature with graphite-monochromatized
Mo Kα X-radiation (λ = 0.7107 Å). Data reductions
were performed with SAINT software21 and
intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. Absorption
effects were empirically evaluated by SADABS software22 and absorption corrections were applied to the data. Crystal
structures were solved by direct methods (SIR 97)23 and refined by full-matrix least-squares procedures on F2 using all reflections (SHELXL 2018/1).24 All hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated
positions with the appropriate AFIX instructions and were refined
using a riding model. Anisotropic displacement parameters were refined
for all nonhydrogen atoms. Perchlorate counterions that are not bonded
to metal centers exhibited positional disorder, resolved by placing
the Cl species and one O specie in two-half populated atom sites and
using soft geometrical restraint on perchlorate’s bond distances
and bond angles. Soft geometrical restraints were also used for the
other perchlorate counterions, probably affected by an unresolved
positional disorder. CCDC 1847728 contains the supplementary crystallographic
data for this paper. These data can be obtained free of charge from
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre.
