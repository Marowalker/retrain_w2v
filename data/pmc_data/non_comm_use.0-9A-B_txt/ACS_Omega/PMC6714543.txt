The absolute configuration of the
alkaloid galantamine was studied
using a range of solution-state techniques; nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and Raman optical activity
(ROA). While the combined use of NMR and VCD does provide a fast,
high-resolution methodology for determining the absolute configuration
of galantamine, both techniques were needed in concert to achieve
this goal. ROA, on the other hand, proved to be sensitive enough to
assign the full absolute configuration without relying on other techniques.
In both cases, statistical validation was applied to aid the determination
of absolute configuration. In the case of galantamine, ROA combined
with statistical validation is shown to be a powerful stand-alone
tool for absolute configuration determination.

1 Introduction
The
vibrational optical activity (VOA) spectroscopic techniques:
either combining infrared absorption (IR) with vibrational circular
dichroism (VCD) or Raman scattering with Raman optical activity (ROA),
respectively, have emerged as powerful analytical tools in the last
decade.1,2 Both sets of techniques combine the structural
sensitivity of vibrational spectroscopy with the three-dimensional
chiral resolution offered from chiroptical spectroscopy, leading to
more information-rich spectra than those obtained from electronic
circular dichroism.3−5 Hence, these techniques offer a complementary route
to structure elucidation and absolute configuration analysis, especially
when classical methods, such as X-ray crystallography cannot be applied.7−9 In particular, VCD has been adopted by the field of analytical chemistry
in this context.10−14 Contrarily, ROA has for historical reasons mainly been applied to
structural biological studies of biomacromolecules.2,15,16 Because of technical limitations in the
early years of ROA development, the method was mainly used to study
samples in aqueous solution, as water has a very benign Raman profile.
Water is, on the other hand, a problematic solvent for IR, and thus
the two branches of VOA diverged in research foci. As the ROA technology
has developed, the abovementioned limitations have been set aside,
opening this very sensitive spectroscopic technique to new fields.
Recently, the absolute configuration of Taxol in methanol was studied
using ROA,17 setting the stage for the
method to enter the field of analytical chemistry? Here, we examine
the versatility of the VOA techniques by applying three solution-based
methods to the same benchmark study: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
IR/VCD, and Raman/ROA. The very nature of chiroptical methods entails
that the study employs a combination of the experimental methods.
Mentioned along with computational simulation techniques and comparison
algorithms to predict and assign spectral bands. As a benchmark, we
have chosen the chiral alkaloid galantamine. (−)-Galantamine
(Figure 1) is found
in the bulbs and flowers of several species from the Amaryllidaceae
family, such as the Caucasian snowdrop (Galanthus woronowii), common snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis), and several species of daffodils (Narcissus spp.).18−20 It is approved by the EMA (European Medicine Agency) and the US
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) as a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase
and an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.21−25 It has proven effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s
disease.26−30 BEcause of the possibly significantly different biological activity
of stereoisomers of medicinally active molecules, knowledge of the
relative and absolute configuration of compounds such as galantamine
is of utmost importance.

Figure 1 Structure and atom numbering of galantamine.
The molecule contains
three chiral centers, at atom numbers 4a, 6, and 8a.

In this study, we show that while, in this particular case,
NMR
or VCD independently are limited to identifying the relative configuration
of galantamine, combining the two techniques allows for full (relative
and absolute) configuration analysis. In contrast, ROA is able to
unambiguously assign the absolute configuration of galantamine on
its own, strongly endorsing the technique as a potential stand-alone
chiroptical method in structure elucidation.

2 Computational
Methods
Calculation of NMR, VCD, and ROA spectra requires
all conformers
of the compound to be taken into account. Therefore, a stochastic
conformational search with molecular mechanics force fields was performed
on the four possible relative configurations shown in Figure 2. For each relative configuration,
two enantiomers are possible. For NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopy,
both enantiomers of each of these duos have the same spectrum. For
VCD and ROA, there is an exact mirror image relationship between the
spectra of enantiomers. Hence, it suffices to compute only one enantiomer
of each of the four relative configurations. For the conformational
search, algorithms from the software packages Conflex31−33 (“reservoir filling”) and Spartan1634 (Monte Carlo) were employed, in combination with the MMFF94S35,36 and SYBYL37 force fields, respectively.
These two parallel approaches yield some redundant conformers, which
were removed prior to ab initio geometry optimization and the calculation
of the VOA spectra. All conformers were subsequently optimized at
the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory using Gaussian 09,38 and all unique conformers with a relative enthalpy of at
most 5 kcal/mol above the most stable one were further optimized at
the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level. Harmonic frequencies, dipole strengths,
and rotational strengths were then calculated at this same level for
each conformer. To obtain the respective IR and VCD spectra, harmonic
frequencies were scaled with a global scale factor σ optimized
for maximum IR similarity using CompareVOA39 with a Lorentzian broadening function with a full width at half
maximum (fwhm) of 10 cm–1 for the dipole and rotational
strengths. For the Raman and ROA spectra, the same level of theory
was used, and Raman and ROA intensities were calculated with an incident
light wavelength of 532 nm. Raman and ROA intensities were broadened
with a Lorentzian function with fwhm of 20 cm–1.
Finally, magnetic shielding tensors were calculated at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G**
level of theory using Gaussion 09, for comparison with experimental 1H and 13C data. In line with the work of Goodman
et al.,40,41 we compute a probability that an observed
error in chemical shift could be obtained by chance for every configuration.
To that end, all conformers were re-optimized and isotropic shielding
constants were calculated at the PW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory.42,43 Isotropic shielding constants were converted to chemical shifts
relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) using linear regression with the
experimental chemical shift data. Gauge-independent atomic orbitals
were used in all calculations, together with a self-consistent reaction
field for solvent modeling, using a dielectric constant for chloroform
of ε = 4.71.

3 Experimental Techniques
3.1 Preparation of the Free Base of Galantamine
Hydrobromide
(−)-Galantamine hydrobromide was kindly
provided by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., Beerse, Belgium. (−)-Galantamine
hydrobromide (2.0 g) was taken into 20 mL of water and the pH was
adjusted to 9–9.5 with 10% Na2CO3 solution
at room temperature. Sodium chloride (1.5 g) and toluene (20 mL) were
added to this mixture, which was subsequently stirred at 50–55
°C for 45 min. The aqueous layer was separated and washed with
toluene (2 × 10 mL) at 50–55 °C. The combined organic
layers were removed in vacuo at a maximum temperature of about 60
°C. Remaining traces of solvent and water were removed by overnight
lyophilization, yielding 1.33 g of the free base.

3.2 NMR Spectroscopy
1H, 13C, COSY,
NOESY, and HMQC spectra were recorded in CDCl3 at 400 MHz
(1H) and 100 MHz (13C) with
TMS as the internal standard. Galantamine (1): 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.67 (1H, d, J = 8.2 Hz, CH3OCCHCH), 6.63 (1H, d, J = 8.2 Hz, CH3OCCHCH), 6.06 (1H,
dd, J = 10.4, 1.2 Hz, CCH=CHCH(OH)),
6.01 (1H, ddd, J = 10.4, 5.6, 1.2 Hz, CCH=CHCH(OH)), 4.62 (1H, s, ArOCHCH2),
4.15 (1H, t, J = 1.2 Hz, CH=CHCH(OH)), 4.11 (1H, d, J = 15.3 Hz, NCH2Ar), 3.84 (3H, s, OCH3), 3.72
(1H, d, J = 15.3 Hz, NCH2Ar), 3.30 (1H, dd, J = 14.4, 12.8 Hz, NCH2CH2), 3.07 (1H, d, J = 14.4
Hz, NCH2CH2), 2.70 (1H, ddd, J = 14.8, 3.3, 1.9 Hz, OCHCH2CH(OH)),
2.42 (3H, s, NCH3), 2.10 (1H, td, J = 12.8, 2.8 Hz, NCH2CH2), 2.01 (1H, ddd, J = 16.0, 5.6, 2.4 Hz, OCHCH2CH(OH)), 1.61 (1H, dd, J = 10.0,
1.2 Hz, NCH2CH2); 13C-NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δ 146.16 (COCH3), 144.54 (CH3OCCO), 133.27
(NCH2CCCO), 129.50 (NCH2CCCO), 128.00 (CCH=CHCH(OH)), 126.93 (CCH=CHCH(OH)), 122.44 (CH3OCCHCH), 111.62
(CH3OCCHCH), 88.96 (CH(OH)CH2CHO), 62.29 (CH=CHCH(OH)), 60.65 (NCH2Ar), 56.19 (ArOCH3),

48.41 (NCH2CH2CCH=CH), 42.01
(CH3,NCH3), 33.85 (CH(OH)CH2CHO), 30.19 (NCH2CH2C).

3.3 IR and VCD Spectroscopy
IR and VCD
spectra for (−)-Galantamine were recorded on a dual PEM ChiralIR-2X
spectrometer (Biotools Inc., Jupiter, FL). All measurements were performed
in CDCl3 with a concentration of 0.168 M. A cell with 100
μm path length and BaF2 windows was used. Both the
sample and the solvent spectrum were recorded with a resolution of
4 cm–1, totaling 30 000 scans each with both
PEMs optimized at 1400 cm–1. The final baseline-corrected
VCD spectrum was obtained through subtraction of the solvent spectrum.

3.4 Raman and ROA Spectroscopy
Raman
and ROA spectra were recorded on a ChiralRAMAN-2X (BioTools Inc.,
Jupiter, FL) instrument, providing backscattering Raman and ROA (SCP180)
data with a resolution of approximately 7 cm–1.
Galantamine was recorded in a freshly prepared 1 M CHCl3 solution for 420 min with a laser power at the source of 100 mW,
using a 532 nm excitation wavelength.

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 Conformational Analysis
From Figure 1, three
asymmetric
carbon atoms (4a, 6 and 8a) can be identified in galantamine, yielding
23 = 8 possible absolute configurations. However, it suffices
to consider only four configurations because NMR is not sensitive
to the absolute configuration and for the VOA techniques, the spectrum
of an enantiomer can be obtained simply by mirroring the spectrum.
Because NMR, VCD, and ROA are geometry-dependent properties, conformational
analysis on all four relative configurations was performed in order
to properly account for this dependency. The four configurations considered
are 4aS,6R,8aS,
4aR,6R,8aR, 4aS,6R,8aR, and 4aR,6R,8aS, see Figure 2.

Conformational
analysis was performed on these four configurations as described in
the Computational Methods section. Only the unique minima with a relative
enthalpy ΔH° < 5.0 kcal/mol relative
to the most stable conformer in the potential energy surface as computed
at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory were retained. This resulted in
a total of 40 conformers for 4aR,6R,8aR, 19 for 4aR,6R,8aS, 17 for 4aS,6R,8aR and 7 for 4aS,6R,8aS.

It can be observed that the 4aS,6R,8aS configuration
has considerably fewer conformers
than the other three configurations. This is due to it being the only
configuration that allows for an intramolecular hydrogen bond between
the alcohol hydrogen and the furan oxygen, largely reducing the flexibility
of the 4a–8a six-membered ring. The other three configurations
do not have such a restricting hydrogen bond, allowing additional
flexibility in that ring. All low-energy conformers are included in
the spectroscopic analysis.

4.2 NMR Analysis
Traditionally,
(1D-)NMR,
in combination with COSY, HMQC, and NOESY experiments, is used for
the determination of the relative configuration of natural products.5,6 Although successful, we here opt for a different approach that is
less labor intensive, can be partially automated and allows for avoidance
of any bias by providing a level of confidence to the assignment of
the relative configuration, which is not possible with a manual NMR
assignment. This approach starts with the calculation of isotropic
shielding constants for all H and C atoms of each conformer of each
configuration. These shielding constants are readily available when
a VCD calculation is performed, hence no extra calculations are needed.
To obtain calculated chemical shifts that can be compared to the 1H and 13C experimental chemical shifts, a linear
regression of the shielding constant versus the experimental shifts
was performed. This linear regression is shown in Figure 3 for the 1H NMR
experiment with the calculated shift of the 4aS,6R,8aS configuration. The linear regression
data for the other diastereoisomers are completely analogous.

Figure 3 Linear regression
of the calculated isotropic magnetic shielding
for all H-atoms of 4aS,6R,8aS vs the experimental 1H NMR
chemical shifts.

This linear fit has several
advantages. First of all, the y-intercept gives an
estimate for the isotropic shielding
constant of the internal standard, most often TMS. This is used to
convert the shielding constants to chemical shifts of an atom (δi = σTMS – σi). Second, the slope of the linear fit can
be used as a scale factor to correct for the systematic errors in
the calculations because of the many approximations made. Finally,
the correlation coefficient r2 gives a
measure for the random error. A high r2 denotes a tight fit to the experiment, meaning that the calculated
shifts give an accurate estimate of the experiment. A lower r2 is a sign that the experiment is not accurately
reproduced, which can suggest that the calculation corresponds to
another structure (relative configuration) than the experiment. The
scaled calculated shifts can be obtained42,43 as  

In order to evaluate the agreement between
these calculated shifts
and the experimental ones, two more parameters are computed. The first
is the corrected mean absolute error (CMAE), computed as CMAE = 1/n∑1n|δi,calc – δi,exp| where n corresponds
to the number of atoms considered. The lower the CMAE value, the better
the agreement with the experiment. To obtain a level of confidence
for an NMR assignment, the DP4 method proposed by Goodman et al.40,41 was also employed. In this method, the probability that an observed
error in chemical shift is obtained by chance for each possible configuration
is evaluated. Using Bayes’ theorem, this is converted to the
probability that each candidate structure in turn is the correct one.
All 13C and 1H data have been processed this
way, with the detailed results presented in Table 1.

4aR,6R,8aS	3.866	12.646	0.985	–1.043	188.30	0.0	
a For both 1H and 13C NMR, 4aS,6R,8aS has the preferred relative configuration. The difference
with 4aR,6R,8aR can however only be confidently established using Bayes’
theorem as reflected in the DP4 probability.

From the data analysis, it is very clear that for
both 13C and 1H the 4aS,6R,8aS enantiomeric pair configuration of
galantamine gives the
best fit to the experimental data. For this configuration, both 13C and 1H calculations give the lowest value for
the CMAE and maximum error εmax, and have the highest
correlation coefficient R2. These observations
are confirmed by the DP4 analysis, which gives a very high probability
for the 4aS,6R,8aS pair relative configuration. The three other relative configurations
have a very small probability of being the correct structure. Furthermore,
if 1H and 13C data are combined in the DP4 analysis,
the probability that 4aS,6R,8aS is the correct structure rises to 100%. These results
thus lead to a very high confidence that galantamine has either the
4aS,6R,8aS or the
4aR,6S,8aR absolute
configuration, as NMR cannot distinguish between both enantiomers.
Hence, while NMR analysis, without chemical substitution, is a powerful
analytical technique, it is limited by the lack of chiral sensitivity.
Hence, NMR as a single technique without special extra techniques
or interventions such as chiral agents does not suffice to determine
absolute configurations although it does for relative configuration.

4.3 IR/VCD Spectroscopy
The experimental
and predicted IR and VCD spectra of galantamine and the four possible
absolute configurations are presented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

Figure 4 Comparison
between the experimental IR spectrum (measured in CDCl3) (a) of galantamine and Boltzmann weighted calculated IR
spectra of the 4aS,6R,8aS (b), 4aS,6R,8aR (c), 4aR,6R,8aS (d), and 4aR,6R,8aR (e) configurations of the molecule. Y-axis labels are placed alternating left/right to avoid congestion.

Figure 5 Comparison between the experimental VCD spectrum (measured
in CDCl3) (a) of galantamine and Boltzmann weighted calculated
VCD
spectra of the 4aS,6R,8aS (b), 4aS,6R,8aR (c), 4aR,6R,8aS (d), and 4aR,6R,8aR (e) configurations of the molecule. Y-axis labels are placed alternating left/right to avoid congestion.

Studying the IR spectra in Figure 4, it is clear that there is a reasonable
overall agreement
for all four configurations. However, the pattern between 970 and
1080 cm–1 is most adequately reproduced for the
4aS,6R,8aS configuration
of galantamine, as is the pattern between 1400 and 1475 cm–1. This way, IR gives a first indication of the relative configuration
of galantamine. However, the distinction between the four calculated
spectra is far too small to be able to draw any kind of conclusion
on the relative configuration. IR does not even suffice to distinguish
relative configurations.

Compared to the IR data, the VCD spectra
in Figure 5 provide
a much more complicated picture,
with complex positive and negative band structures. Even so, from
a simple visual inspection alone, it is tempting to immediately discount
the 4aR,6R,8aR and
4aS,6R,8aR configurations,
as these appear to have the incorrect sign through most of the spectra.
Therefore, such analysis would in fact favor the opposite enantiomers
(4aS,6S,8aS and
4aR,6S,8aS), which
means that a qualitative assignment of absolute configuration is impossible.

Hence, as a stand-alone technique, VCD fails to deliver an unambiguous
assignment of absolute configuration in the case of galantamine. Even
so, if VCD spectroscopy is combined with the NMR analysis, the 4aS,6R,8aS emerges as a
clear favorite. This is an interesting conclusion, as VCD has, in
the case of the alkaloid jonquailine, been shown to be crucial to
correctly assign absolute configuration.44

4.4 Raman/ROA Spectroscopy
Equivalent
to the previous section, the experimental and predicted Raman and
ROA spectra of galantamine and the four possible absolute configurations
are presented in Figures 6 and 7, respectively.

Figure 6 Boltzmann weighted calculated
Raman spectra for 4aS,6R,8aS (b), 4aS,6R,8aR (c), 4aR,6R,8aS (d), and 4aR,6R,8aR (e), compared with the
experimental Raman (measured in CHCl3) (a). Regions deleted
in the experimental Raman spectrum are due to strong solvent bands
interfering with the spectrum. Y-axis labels are
placed alternating left/right to avoid congestion.

Figure 7 Boltzmann weighted calculated ROA spectra for 4aS,6R,8aS (b), 4aS,6R,8aR (c), 4aR,6R,8aS (d), and 4aR,6R,8aR (e), compared with the
experimental ROA spectrum (measured in CHCl3) (a). Y-axis labels are placed alternating left/right to avoid
congestion.

As was the case for IR, the Raman
data (Figure 6) can
arguably be assigned to all four possible
configurations, as the main features of the experimental spectrum,
from 1100 to 1700 cm–1, are quite well reproduced
in all four predicted spectra. Interestingly, below 1100 cm–1, all predicted spectra tend to underestimate the intensity of the
bands, leading to very weak features compared to the experimental
spectrum.

The ROA spectra in Figure 7 reveal a startling comparison, in contrast
to the visual
inspection of the VCD data. Instantly, the predicted spectrum of the
4aS,6R,8aS configuration
of galantamine appears as the best comparison to experiment. Except
for an intensity exaggeration of the couplet between 1660 and 1700
cm–1 and the positive band at 1350 cm–1, most bands from this configuration can be assigned in terms of
shape, position, and intensity to the experimental spectrum. This
is not the case for any of the other three possible configurations
and neither does an assignment of opposite enantiomer seem appropriate.
Therefore, from a simple qualitative analysis, ROA is able to positively
identify a single absolute configuration.

4.5 Statistical
Validation
Visual inspection
of spectra and assignment of the absolute configuration from VOA spectra
alone can lead to significant bias and may influence any conclusion
drawn. To that end, dedicated VOA algorithms have been designed that
allow establishing a numerical degree of agreement between experimental
and theoretical spectra. Our group introduced the CompareVOA algorithm
that projects a numerical measure of agreement between a theoretical
spectrum and an experimental spectrum in a database of known and validated
correct assignments and from this extracts a level of confidence.39 However, this method depends on a database of
validated assignments and moreover such a database does not (yet)
exist for ROA spectra. An alternative approach to unbiased validation
of an assignment relies on an internal validation step. The details
of the so-called Amphidromus algorithm can be found in Vandenbussche
et al.45 but the essence consists of the
following steps:

The similarity Rexp,calc is computed between the calculated spectrum and the experimental
spectrum. Good agreement is reflected in a high similarity value,
optimally equal to 100%.

The calculated spectrum is perturbed
randomly to generate a set
of new spectra x and the similarity to both the original
calculated spectrum and the experimental spectrum is computed, leading
to the values Rx,calc and Rx,exp, respectively.
This is repeated for a large set of perturbations (x = 25000).

The values of Rx,calc and Rx,exp are plotted
and the shape of the point cloud examined. If the computed and experimental
spectra coincide, the point cloud actually becomes a straight line.
The more circular the cloud becomes, the less validated the agreement
between theory and experiment is.

This algorithm clearly reveals
where the best agreement is found
between theory and experiment. In the case of VCD, the calculated
spectra of two diastereomers match experiment equally well, see Figure 8.

Figure 8 Randomization plots for
the VCD spectra of 4aS,6R,8aS (left) and 4aR,6R,8aS (right). Both configurations
show a high similarity between the ab initio computed spectrum (red
dot = Rexp,calc) and the experiment, and
a similar behavior of the random spectra.

The red dots, reflecting the similarity Rexp,calc, show only a modest difference whereas the point clouds
show largely similar features. This shows that VCD alone does not
allow to establish neither the relative nor absolute configuration.
As already indicated from the qualitative analysis, VCD works well
in tandem with NMR but it does not answer the fundamental question
in the present paper: what sole technique among NMR and VOA techniques
allows establishing absolute configurations?

In case of ROA,
the distinction is a lot clearer as is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Randomization plots for the ROA spectra of 4aS,6R,8aS (left) and 4aR,6R,8aS (right). The
4aR,6R,8aS configuration
shows a rather circular distribution and low correlation, with a large
portion of the random spectra showing higher similarity with the experiment
than the actual calculation (red dot = Rexp,calc).

Comparing both point clouds in Figure 9, the shape of the
left one is much more
in line with a good fit than the right cloud. Moreover, in the case
of the left point cloud, the red dot—showing the similarity
between the computed and true experimental spectrum—reveals
the highest similarity of all spectra. This is not the case for the
4aR,6R,8aS configuration.
Many randomized spectra perform significantly better and the value
indicated by the red point is hardly half of that for the 4aS,6R,8aS configuration.

This means that the statistical validation clearly supports the
observations made in the qualitative analysis: In the case of galantamine,
VCD cannot distinguish between two configurations varying in one chiral
center, while ROA can. Hence, this particular study implies that ROA
can work as a stand-alone technique for absolute configuration analysis,
while VCD must rely on other techniques, such as NMR, to complete
the analysis.

5 Conclusions
In this
study, the performances of the NMR, IR/VCD, and Raman/ROA
techniques as stand-alone techniques toward absolute configuration
analysis of a chiral natural product, galantamine, have been compared.
While NMR is responsive to relative absolute configuration and thus
supplies a partial solution to the configuration problem, it does
not suffice to establish the absolute configuration. Interestingly,
VCD alone also does not suffice in this case as it does not sufficiently
well distinguish between relative configurations. Only when combining
NMR and VCD data can one obtain an unambiguous absolute configuration
assignment. Contrarily, when applying ROA as an absolute configuration
tool in case of galantamine, this technique delivers on its own, resulting
in a clear assignment without any supporting extra experimental methods.
Future studies involving, for example, drug molecules based on the
galantamine scaffold will shed further light on the direct applicability
of ROA in structure elucidation of complex chiral compounds.
