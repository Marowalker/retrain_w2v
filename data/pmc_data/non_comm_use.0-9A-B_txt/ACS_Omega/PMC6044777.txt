Protein
A affinity adsorbent with high antibody-binding capacity
plays a prominent part in the purification of biopharmaceuticals to
decrease the manufacturing costs. We describe a site-specific covalent
conjugation strategy for protein A to immobilize on agarose beads.
Recombinant protein A, which has one cysteine introduced at the C
terminus through genetic engineering technology, was immobilized site-specifically
on maleimide-functionalized agarose beads by the thiol–maleimide
reaction. As a comparison, the recombinant protein A was randomly
immobilized on the aldehyde-functionalized agarose beads via free
amino groups on the protein surface. The site-specific conjugation
of recombinant protein A on the agarose beads was validated through
the assay of free SH groups on the adsorbents using the Ellman’s
reagent. Adsorbents containing various amounts of protein A were used
to adsorb antibody from human plasma. Analysis of immunoturbidimetry
showed that the adsorbed fractions contained the 90.1% IgG, 4.2% IgA,
and 5.7% IgM. The maximal antibodies-binding capacities with static
adsorption and dynamic adsorption were approximately 64 and 50 mg,
respectively, per swollen gram for site-specifically conjugated adsorbent
and 31 and 26 mg for randomly conjugated adsorbent. Remarkably, the
high antibody-binding capacity for site-specifically conjugated adsorbent
outperformed the existing commercial protein A Sepharose (approximately
30 mg/g). The orientation of a protein is crucial for its activity
after immobilization, and these results demonstrate that the site-specifically
conjugated protein molecule is in a functionally active form to interact
with the antibody with weak steric hindrance. The proposed approach
may be an attractive strategy to synthesize affinity adsorbents with
high-binding capacity.

Introduction
Affinity chromatography
has been described as the most selective
method for protein purification because it eliminates purification
steps and increases the yields.1,2 The conjugation chemistry
between the protein and the solid support plays an essential role
in the performance of the chromatographic system,2 and the optimal conjugation chemistry must assure the binding
activity of the protein. However, in most covalent conjugation approaches,
the protein remains immobilized on the solid support through the reaction
of the amine of lysine residues of the protein with electrophiles
on the support. Such random amide bond formation between the protein
and the solid support can result in the loss of protein activity as
a result of improper orientation of the protein on the solid surface.3,4 By contrast, site-specific conjugation strategies provide the defined
immobilization of proteins with uniform orientation where the bioactive
site (binding epitope) is freely accessible for application.5,6 As a result, recent efforts have focused on site-specific covalent
conjugation for protein immobilization.7−9 Several bioorthogonal
chemistries are available for protein site-specific conjugation to
effect “traceless” protein activities,10 such as expressed protein ligation,11 protein trans-splicing,12 CuI-catalyzed alkyne/azide cycloaddition (CuAAC, click chemistry),13 the Staudinger ligation,14 and the Diels–Alder reaction.15

Protein site-specific conjugation can be conveniently
achieved
if the protein possesses a single accessible, reactive cysteine (Cys),
which is the only naturally occurring amino acid containing a thiol
group in its side chain.16−18 The Cys residue is highly suitable
for conjugation as its thiol group readily undergoes the nucleophilic
substitution reaction with electrophilic reagents or Michael addition
to α,β-unsaturated carbonyls (e.g., maleimides) to form
stable thioether bonds.19,20 The thiol addition
to maleimide is widely used for the preparation of peptide and oligonucleotide
conjugates and arrays, biosensors, fluorescent labeling of proteins
and other biomolecules, and so forth.5

Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is a cell-wall-bound
pathogenicity factor from the bacterium Staphylococcus
aureus. It exhibits tight binding to many IgG, IgA,
and IgM molecules, and the IgG-binding region includes five highly
homologous domains (E-D-A-B-C).21 Affinity
chromatography based on SpA is the most widespread and accepted methodology
for antibody purification.22 The Z-domain,
a mutant domain (N23T, F30A) derived from the B-domain of SpA, has
been shown to have IgG-capturing efficiency similar to that of B-domain
of SpA.23 The Z-domain contains three α-helices
in the polypeptide segments Lys7 to His18 (α1), Glu25 to Asp36
(α2), and Ser41 to Ala54 (α3).24 The interaction between Z-domain and IgG is such that only α1
and α2 helices bind to the hinge region of the second and third
constant domains (CH2 and CH3) of the Fc fragment,
without involving the C-terminal α3 helix.25 Owing to the lack of intrinsic Cys residues for the Z-domain,
when Cys residue is introduced into the C terminus of the Z-domain,
oriented immobilization of the Z-domain on the solid surface can be
conveniently achieved by exposing the IgG-binding epitope to the media.

The development and applications of protein site-specific conjugation
have undergone significant advances in recent years, especially for
the protein microarray or protein biochip.5,6,9,26,27 However, this approach is rarely used for affinity
chromatography. In this work, we report the successful site-specific
covalent conjugation for recombinant protein A (ZZZ protein, three
tandem Z domains) through the reaction of the Cys-modified C terminus
of the ZZZ protein with maleimide-functionalized agarose beads. After
the affinity adsorbents have been developed, they will be used for
IgG-binding from human plasma. The results will then be compared with
those obtained using the Schiff-base method, a common amine-based
conjugation technique used for recombinant protein A.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Recombinant Protein A (ZZZ-Cys and ZZZ)
By using Cys-specific
modification, a unique Cys was genetically
introduced into the C-terminus of ZZZ protein that resulted in engineered
ZZZ-Cys. In this study, we engineered a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminus
of ZZZ-Cys for protein purification using immobilized-metal affinity
chromatography. The cartoon structure of ZZZ-Cys protein is shown
in Figure 1. The proteins
ZZZ-Cys and ZZZ were analyzed using 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the results are shown in Figure 1. Highly purified
proteins were obtained as shown in the SDS-PAGE (Figure 1, lanes 3 and 4) for ZZZ under
nonreducing condition and ZZZ-Cys under reducing condition. The protein
bands had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa, which
corresponded to the theoretical value calculated for the ZZZ and ZZZ-Cys.
However, some fraction of the purified ZZZ-Cys had spontaneously formed
dimer through intermolecular disulfide bond (Figure 1, lane 5). The same phenomenon was also discovered
for the Z-Cys and ZZ-Cys reported by Uhlen et al.28 To obtain the monomeric ZZZ-Cys protein bearing the free
thiol group, the protein was reduced using 2-mercaptoethanol. However,
a trace amount of the dimer was still formed after 1 day, and the
amount increased slowly up to approximately 50% in a week (Figure 1, lane 6). The results
showed spontaneous dimerization has occurred during the protein storage
process. Therefore, the site-specific immobilization of ZZZ-Cys on
the agarose beads should be performed using the freshly reduced ZZZ-Cys.

Oriented and Random Immobilization of the
SpA
The C-terminal
Cys residue provided the oriented immobilization of ZZZ-Cys on maleimide-activated
agarose beads. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route of the adsorbent for ZZZ-Cys to site-specifically
immobilize on the agarose beads (coded as A-SI). Sepharose 6FF amination
was performed using the reactions of agarose beads with epichlorohydrin
and then ethylenediamine. The heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent
of 3-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester
(MBS) was used to react with amino-modified matrix, resulting in the
formation of maleimide-functionalized matrix. The reaction of maleimide
with free SH group at the C-terminus of ZZZ-Cys leads to the oriented
immobilization of ZZZ-Cys on agarose beads. As a comparison, the random
immobilization of ZZZ on agarose beads was carried out using Schiff-base
method. Scheme 2 shows
the synthetic route of the adsorbent for ZZZ to randomly immobilize
on the agarose beads (coded as A-RI). Sepharose 6FF was activated
by NaIO4 to obtain the aldehyde-functionalized matrix.
The reaction of the aldehyde with one of many amino groups on the
ZZZ chain leads to the random immobilization of ZZZ on agarose beads.

of ZZZ-Cys
Scheme 2 Synthetic Route of
Adsorbent A-RI for Random Immobilization of ZZZ
The adsorbents with different protein densities
were obtained by
the addition of increasing amounts of the protein, and the results
are shown in Table 1. The coupling efficiency of ZZZ-Cys protein decreased with an increasing
concentration of ZZZ-Cys and was higher than 90% for the concentration
lower than 4 mg/mL and between 80 and 90% for the concentration between
6 and 10 mg/mL. The coupling efficiencies of ZZZ protein were higher
than 90% during the concentration of 1 and 10 mg/mL. In our understanding,
thiol–maleimide reaction should be more efficient than the
aldehyde–amino coupling reaction. The lower coupling efficiencies
of ZZZ-Cys are most likely attributed to spontaneous dimerization
during the reaction process, especially for the ZZZ-Cys of high concentration.
Note that the coupling efficiency of ZZZ-Cys protein was higher than
80% for site-specific immobilization, which demonstrated that the
ZZZ-Cys protein was overwhelmingly present as a monomer with the free
SH groups for the freshly reduced ZZZ-Cys. Additionally, the adsorbents
with different immobilization grades can be obtained simply by varying
the amount of added ZZZ-Cys to the activated Sepharose.

To prove
that the ZZZ-Cys protein was site-specifically immobilized
on the agarose beads through the SH group at the C terminus for the
adsorbent A-SI, the detection of the SH group on the surface of adsorbents
was performed, as shown in Scheme 3. As we know, Ellman’s reagent of 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) is able to react with the free SH group but not with
the thioether bond. Because of the lack of intrinsic Cys residues
for the ZZZ protein, only one Cys residue exists at the C terminus
for the ZZZ-Cys protein. For the adsorbent A-SI, the only one SH group
reacted with maleimide, resulting in no free SH group on the surface
of the adsorbent A-SI, which could not react with the reagent DTNB.
As a comparison, the ZZZ-Cys protein was randomly immobilized on the
agarose beads using Schiff-base method with the added concentration
of 6 mg/mL (coded as A-RI-6-Cys). In the case of random immobilization,
aldehyde-functionalized matrices are able to react with the amino
or SH group to form linkages (secondary amino group after reduced
and thioether bond). In the case of the reaction of aldehyde with
the amino group, the adsorbent is able to react with the reagent DTNB.
The reaction product, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (TNB), has a high
absorbance at 412 nm at pH 8.0. Therefore, the adsorbent A-SI-6 and,
as a control group, the adsorbent A-RI-6-Cys reacted with DTNB in
the Tris solution, pH 8.0, and subsequently precipitated by centrifugation
at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was analyzed using UV–vis
spectroscopy, and the result is shown in Figure 2. Significant absorbance at 412 nm (A412nm) could only be observed in the case of
the adsorbent A-RI-6-Cys. However, upon incubation with the Ellman’s
reagent, almost no A412nm signal could
be observed, and a modest increase in A325nm of DTNB was detected for the adsorbent A-SI. The results indicated
that the ZZZ-Cys protein was site-specifically immobilized on the
agarose bead by Cys at the C terminus for the adsorbent A-SI.

Antibody Binding Capacity
After confirming the thiol-site
specific for immobilization of the adsorbent A-SI, the adsorbents
A-SI and A-RI containing increasing ligand densities were subsequently
used for antibody-binding from the human plasma using static and dynamic
adsorption experiments.

Using blank agarose beads without immobilized
SpA as a control group, the static antibody-binding capacity for the
adsorbents of A-SI and A-RI was determined using batch experiment.
For each stationary phase, 1 g of adsorbent and 20 mL of human plasma
sample were incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for
2 h. The bonded materials were eluted by lowering the pH to 2.5 and
then were neutralized with Tris to pH 7.0. The eluent content was
analyzed using immunoturbidimetry after being concentrated approximately
fivefold by ultrafiltration with millipore filtration. Table 2 shows the effect of the protein
density immobilized on the surface of the agarose beads on the antibody
adsorption activity. The agarose only adsorbed 1.6 mg/g antibody,
which was far below the performance of adsorbents A-SI and A-RI, indicating
that the ZZZ protein played an important role in antibody adsorption.
As we know, the SpA exhibits tight binding to many IgG, a small amount
of IgA and IgM molecules. Analysis of eluted materials using immunoturbidimetry
showed that the absorbed antibody composed of 90.1% IgG, 4.2% IgA,
and 5.7% IgM. The IgG purity of 90.1% was comparable with the performance
achieved by conventional protein A affinity resins.

a The data are not
available because
the concentration is too low to exceed the lowest limit of immunoturbidimetry
measurement.

b The antibody-binding
ratio is calculated
assuming that the antibody is composed of IgG because of the IgG purity
of more than 90%.

The antibody-binding
capacity of adsorbents increased with the
increase in ligand density. In the case of adsorbent A-SI, the antibody-binding
capacity continued to increase when ZZZ-Cys immobilization content
increased from 0.98 to 8.12 mg/g. The maximum antibody-binding capacity
was approximately 64 mg/g when the density of ZZZ-Cys on the agarose
beads was 6.72 mg/g. In the case of adsorbent A-RI, the antibody-binding
capacity similarly continued to increase and the maximum antibody-binding
capacity was approximately 31 mg/g when the density of ZZZ on the
agarose beads was 7.28 mg/g. The results clearly revealed the significant
differences in antibody-binding capacity because of the different
conjugating method. The maximum antibody-binding capacity of 31 mg/g
for randomly conjugated adsorbent A-RI-4 was comparable with the commercial
protein-A Sepharose.29 Surprisingly, the
maximum antibody-binding capacity of 64 mg/g for site-specific adsorbent
A-SI-4 was far above the value for commercial protein A Sepharose
and the adsorbent A-RI. This is probably due to weak steric effects
between the matrix and ZZZ-Cys molecules because of the oriented immobilization
resulting in the IgG-binding epitope freely exposed to the surrounding
media.

To clarify the interaction between the IgG molecule and
the ZZZ
protein coupled to the agarose beads by site-specific and random immobilization,
the binding ratio (mol/mol) was calculated assuming that the antibody
is composed of IgG, and the results are listed in Table 2. Obviously, the binding ratio
of adsorbent A-SI was higher than that of adsorbent A-RI. An initial
approximately 2:3 binding ratio can be observed between immobilized
ZZZ and affinity-bound IgG for the adsorbent A-SI. Thus, every two
immobilized ZZZ molecules can bind three IgG molecules. By contrast,
the binding ratio was approximately 2:1 for adsorbent A-RI at the
high ligand density. The difference in IgG-binding ratio was probably
attributed to the different immobilization pattern. The C terminus
of the ZZZ protein was conjugated with agarose beads by thiol-site
specific immobilization; the IgG-binding epitopes close to the N terminus
of the ZZZ protein for the adsorbent A-SI were exposed to interact
with IgG with the molar ratio of 2:3. However, in the case of adsorbent
A-RI, the IgG-binding epitopes of the ZZZ protein were too close to
the agarose bead, resulting in the difficulty to interact with IgG
because of the steric hindrance.

Dynamic adsorption capacity
is a very important property to assess
the performance of the SpA adsorbent. The adsorbents A-SI-4 and A-RI-4
were used to study the dynamic adsorption of the antibody from human
plasma, and the absorbance spectra of both flow through and elution
fractions for antibody purification are shown in Figure 3. A glass column with 2 g of
adsorbents was used in the experiment and 40 mL of human plasma sample
flow through the column with the rate of 2 mL/min. The area of elution
fraction for A-SI-4 was clearly higher than that for A-RI-4, which
indicated that the dynamic adsorption capacity of the antibody for
A-SI-4 was far above that for A-RI-4. The elution fractions composed
of approximately 90.1% IgG, 4.2% IgA, and 5.7% IgM by the analysis
of immunoturbidimetry. Also, the dynamic adsorption capacity of the
antibody was 50 mg/g for A-SI-4 and 26 mg/g for A-RI-4. The adsorption
of the antibody in dynamic conditions was lower than that in static
conditions, which was likely due to the insufficient contact resulting
in the unsaturated adsorption of the antibody.

both the flow through and elution fraction

A-SI-4 (A) and A-RI-4 (B).

dynamic adsorption (the result of A-RI-4 was similar and not shown).
The IgG molecule consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical
light chains. The molecular weight of the heavy chain is approximately
55 kDa, whereas the light chain is approximately 25 kDa. The result
(Figure 4, lane 3)
indicated that the eluted fraction contained mainly human IgG, which
was comparable with the results achieved by immunoturbidimetry measurement.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have developed a novel affinity adsorbent by oriented
immobilization of a cysteine-containing recombinant protein A molecule
to maleimide-functionalized Sepharose. Meanwhile, protein A was randomly
immobilized on the surface of Sepharose using Schiff-base method as
a comparison. The assay of free SH group on the adsorbent showed that
the ZZZ-Cys protein was validated to react with maleimide-functionalized
Sepharose by the thiol group at the C terminus of ZZZ-Cys. As demonstrated
in this work, the affinity adsorbent, with the site-specific immobilization
at the C terminus of ZZZ-Cys, afforded the higher antibody-binding
from human plasma and outperformed the existing commercial protein-A
Sepharose. The high antibody-binding capacity was attributed to the
weak steric hindrance of oriented ZZZ-Cys with the antibody-binding
epitope exposed. This method opens up the opportunity to fabricate
the adsorbents with high-binding performance by oriented and covalent
immobilization.

Experimental Section
Materials
Agarose
bead (Sepharose 6FF, 45–165
μm), Ni Sepharose 6FF (45–165 μm), and Sephadex
G-25 (50–150 μm) were purchased from GE Healthcare (Sweden).
MBS was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan).
Fresh-frozen human plasma was obtained from a local plasma donation
center. Other reagents and solvents were obtained from Xiya Reagent
(Shandong, China). All reagents used were of analytical grade unless
otherwise stated.

Expression and Purification of the ZZZ-Cys
and ZZZ
The two recombinant gene sequences, ZZZ-Cys and ZZZ,
were synthesized
using polymerase chain reaction technique and then inserted into NdeI/XhoI
sites of the pET22b plasmid with the 6 × His tag at the C terminus.
The plasmids pET22b-ZZZ-Cys and pET22b-ZZZ were constructed and transformed
into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells,
and then, the cells were cultivated in Luria–Bertani medium
containing 100 μg mL–1 ampicillin at 37 °C.
Then, β-d-1-thiogalactopyranosise (IPTG) was added
when A600 is at the range of 0.6–0.8
to induce expression of target protein. Four hours later the cells
were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl and
150 mM NaCl at pH 7.5, and then lysed by ultrasonication. The lysate
was centrifuged, and the supernatant was purified using Ni Sepharose
6FF according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The pooled
fraction was desalted using Sephadex G-25 and then analyzed using
15% SDS-PAGE.

To obtain the monomeric ZZZ-Cys protein with the
free thiol groups, the ZZZ-Cys protein was reduced using 0.5 M 2-mercaptoethanol
in 50 mM Tris/HCI, pH 8.5, for 1 h at 50 °C and then purified
using Sephadex G-25.

Oriented Immobilization of ZZZ-Cys on Agarose
Beads
Agarose beads used in this work were Sepharose 6FF
(GE Healthcare,
Sweden). Oriented covalent immobilization of ZZZ-Cys on Sepharose
6FF was carried out essentially following a protocol as shown in Scheme 1.

Briefly,
an agarose-epoxide matrix was synthesized: 10 g of Sepharose 6FF was
resuspended in 15 mL of 2.5 M NaOH solution containing 0.02% (w/v)
NaBH4 and 10 mL of epichlorohydrin. Then, the suspension
was gently stirred for 4 h at 35 °C, and then, it was washed
with massive distilled water. The agarose-epoxide matrix was then
modified with ethylenediamine (2 mL, 30 mmol) in 20 mL of boric acid
buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 9.0) for 3 h at 50 °C, and then, it
was washed with massive distilled water to obtain the amino-modified
matrix. Finally, the amino-modified matrix was treated with the reagent
of MBS, following the next procedure: 10 g of amino-modified matrix
was resuspended in 30 mL of 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and 2
mL of 10 mM MBS in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added. The suspension
was gently stirred for 4 h at 20 °C. Afterward, the maleimide-functionalized
matrix was obtained by washing with an excess of 20 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2) containing 10% DMSO and water. The freshly reduced ZZZ-Cys
in 20 mM phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.4, was added to the maleimide-functionalized
matrix. The reaction was kept at 20 °C for 24 h with shaking.
The amount of protein coupled was monitored by analyzing of the protein
content at 280 nm before and after immobilization, and protein concentration
was calculated using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 0.18
(mg/mL)−1 cm–1 for ZZZ-Cys. The
remaining free reactive groups were blocked with 10 mM cysteine overnight
and then washed thoroughly before being stored in 20 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4 with 0.2% NaN3 at 4 °C until needed.
The obtained adsorbent using site-specific immobilization technique
was coded as A-SI.

Random Immobilization of ZZZ on Agarose Beads
Random
covalent immobilization of ZZZ on Sepharose 6FF was carried out using
Schiff base method,30 as shown in Scheme 2. Briefly, 10 g of
Sepharose 6FF were resuspended in 20 mL of 1.0 M NaIO4 solution.
Then, the suspension was gently stirred for 2 h at 40 °C in the
dark, and then, it was washed with massive distilled water to obtain
the aldehyde-functionalized matrix. The ZZZ protein in 0.2 M borate
buffer solution, pH 8.5, was added to the aldehyde-functionalized
matrix. The reaction was kept at 20 °C for 24 h with shaking.
The amount of protein coupled was monitored as mentioned above. After
coupling, 30 g of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1.0%
NaBH4 was used to reduce the beads at 20 °C for 4
h. The obtained adsorbent using random immobilization technique was
coded as A-RI.

Detection of the Free SH Group on the Adsorbent
To
validate the thiol-site-specific immobilization of ZZZ-Cys protein
on Sepharose, a modified version of an Ellman’s reagent-based
assay31 was used to determine whether or
not the free SH group exists on the adsorbents of A-SI. As a comparison,
the ZZZ-Cys protein was randomly immobilized on the agarose beads
using Schiff-base method. This assay was performed as shown in Scheme 3. To 0.5 g of adsorbents,
4.5 mL of 0.1 mM DTNB in 0.1 M Tris solution, pH 8.0, was applied
and incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 5 min. Afterward,
the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the
supernatant. UV–vis absorption spectroscopy was carried out
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1780, Shimadzu) from 200
to 600 nm for the supernatant.

Static Adsorption of Antibodies
from Human Plasma
Static
adsorption of antibodies from human plasma on the adsorbents was studied
batchwise. The human blood plasma was thawed, diluted with the same
volume of 20 mM PBS solution, pH 7.4, and then centrifuged at 4000
rpm for 10 min before using. To 1 g of adsorbent, 20 mL of plasma
samples was applied and incubated at room temperature with gentle
shaking for 2 h. Afterward, the adsorbents were packed into a glass
column (50 × 10 mm). The column was then washed with PBS solution
to remove any unbound materials. Bound materials were then eluted
using 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 2.5. The eluted acidic fractions were
immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris. The eluted fraction was checked
using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Meanwhile, the eluted fraction
was concentrated approximately fivefold by ultrafiltration with millipore
filtration (Mw 3000) at 6000 rpm and then

Dynamic Adsorption
of Antibody from Human Plasma
To
evaluate the dynamic adsorption capacity of antibody from human plasma,
2.0 g of adsorbent suspension in PBS solution was packed into a glass
column (50 × 10 mm). Forty milliliters of PBS solution was used
to equilibrate the column at a rate of 2 mL/min, which was controlled
by a peristaltic pump. Subsequently, 40 mL of human plasma was perfused
into the column with 2 mL/min flow rate. PBS solution was used to
wash the nonspecific adsorption of plasma away. Bound materials were
then eluted using 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 2.5. The measurement of
eluted fraction was similar to the one mentioned above.
