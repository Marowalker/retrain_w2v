Water
splitting is a highly promising, environmentally friendly
approach for hydrogen production. It is often discussed in the context
of carbon dioxide free combustion and storage of electrical energy
after conversion to chemical energy. Since the oxidation and reduction
reactions are related to significant overpotentials, the search for
suitable catalysts is of particular importance. Ferroelectric materials,
for example, lithium niobate, attracted considerable interest in this
respect. Indeed, the presence of surfaces with different polarizations
and chemistries leads to spatial separation of reduction and oxidation
reactions, which are expected to be boosted by the electrons and holes
available at the positive and negative surfaces, respectively. Employing
the density functional theory and a simplified thermodynamic approach,
we estimate the overpotentials related to the oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on both polar LiNbO3 (0001) surfaces. Our calculations performed for ideal surfaces
in vacuum predict the lowest overpotential for the hydrogen evolution
reaction (0.4 V) and for the oxygen evolution reaction (1.2 V) at
the positive and at the negative surfaces, respectively, which are
lower than (or comparable with) commonly employed catalysts. However,
calculations performed to model the aqueous solution in which the
reactions occur reveal that the presence of water substantially increases
the required overpotential for the HER, even inverting the favorable
polarization direction for oxidation and reduction reactions. In aqueous
solution, we predict an overpotential of 1.2 V for the HER at the
negative surface and 1.1 V for the OER at the positive surface.

Introduction
Hydrogen production is a promising way
to convert excess electrical
power to chemical energy. Once produced, hydrogen can be combusted
by engines, reconverted into electricity by fuel cells and stored
in large caverns. After methanation (reaction of hydrogen with carbon
oxides to methane, CH4), it can be readily used as natural
gas, for which extended infrastructures (cars, heating, etc.) already
exist.

Water splitting 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 is a feasible way to produce hydrogen. Water is
largely available,
easy to handle, and directly provides ready to use molecular H2 with only O2 as the by-product. As a redox reaction,
water splitting consists of the reduction reaction 4H+ +
4e– → 2H2 and the oxidation reaction
2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e–, which produce hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. They are correspondingly
abbreviated as HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution
reaction). The latter is the more complex reaction, as four electrons
have to be transferred. The reaction is furthermore characterized
by large activation barriers (i.e., large contributions to the overpotential),
which inhibit its course. At this point begins the search of a suitable
catalyst, which makes the water splitting faster and more efficient.

Water splitting is achieved by different approaches. Instead of
providing the required energy with an electrical source, Fujishima
et al. showed that hydrogen can be produced on TiO2 surfaces
under irradiation of sunlight.1 This approach
does not require an external electrical potential and can make hydrogen
an abundant energy source. Similar ideas exist for artificial photosynthesis
and other catalytic processes.2 Photochemical
water splitting on nonpolar GaN surfaces has been thoroughly investigated
combining ab initio molecular dynamics and time-dependent density
functional theory simulations.3,4

Another way to
efficiently achieve water splitting exploits ferroelectric
substrates. Hong et al. made use of the piezoelectrochemical effect
of ZnO microfibers and BaTiO3 microdendrites to generate
hydrogen and oxygen via direct water decomposition,5 while Kakekhani and Ismail-Beigi designed a catalytic cycle
for water splitting that employs the pyroelectric effect in ferroelectric
PbTiO3.6

Ferroelelectrics,
for example, lithium niobate (LiNbO3, LN), offer promising
properties for photocatalytic water splitting.
These materials are characterized by an internal polarization. To
compensate for the polarization charges, surfaces orthogonal to the
polar direction modify their morphology and stoichiometry,7−10 resulting in two distinct terminations with different chemical properties11−15 (Figure 1). This
largely compensates the polarization charge16−19 reducing the surface electric
field. Ferroelectric substrates provide different advantages for photocatalytic
water splitting. On the one hand, incident radiation (with energy
larger than the LN band gap of 3.78 eV20,21) produces
electron–hole-pairs, which show an enhanced lifetime, as the
electric field hinders their recombination. On the other hand, reduction
and oxidation reactions occur on spatially separated surfaces, which
hinders the recombination of the products.22 Furthermore, the positive surface (electron doped) is expected to
provide the electrons necessary for the HER, while the negative surface
(hole doped) is expected to collect the excess electrons resulting
from the OER. Both effects are suitable to catalysis; indeed, lithium
niobate has been proposed as a promising substrate for photocatalytic
reactions.23 In the case of artificial
photosynthesis, a similar redox reaction under solar irradiation,
Stock and Dunn showed experimentally that the catalytic efficiency
of TiO2 is outperformed by the one of LiNbO3.24 This makes large quantum efficiencies
expectable.

Figure 1 (0001) (positive, left-hand side) and (0001̅) (negative,
right-hand side) surfaces of LiNbO3. Red, gray, and white
spheres denote oxygen, lithium, and niobium atoms, respectively. The
1 × 1 surface unit cell is indicated by black lines.

For this reason, we investigate both parts of the
water splitting
reaction on the polar surfaces of LiNbO3. To describe the
system of surface and reagents, we employ the density functional theory.
A simplified thermodynamical approach is used to determine Gibbs free
energy profiles for a prototypical reaction mechanism, which ultimately
allows us to estimate the overpotential of both reactions on either
surfaces. In the first step, we demonstate the catalytic effect of
ferroelectric surfaces by modeling the reactions in vacuum and on
ideal surfaces. Overpotentials as low as 0.39 and 1.22 V are calculated
for the HER and OER, respectively, which are comparable to theoretical
values estimated for excellent catalysts such as rutile RuO2 and TiO2 surfaces.25,26 In the second step,
we model the water splitting reaction under more realistic conditions,
that is, the model influence of the aqueous solution on the surface
reactions. The presence of water substantially enhances the overpotentials
necessary to drive the reaction and even inverts the favored polarization
direction for OER and HER, thus hindering the water splitting reaction
under experimental conditions. The investigation of the relative position
of reaction potentials and substrate band edges shows that the positive
surface is a very good catalyst for the HER, while the negative surface
cannot efficiently drive the OER.

Methods and Models
Density
Functional Theory
To describe the electronic
structure on the atomic level from first principles, we make use of
the density functional theory as implemented in VASP (Version 5.3.5).27,28 Thus, we model the structures and total energies of clean and adsorbed
LN surfaces in a supercell description. To this end, we employ PAW
potentials29 that include the 1s1, 2s1, 2s22p4, and 4s24p64d45s1 valence electrons in the
case of H, Li, O, and Nb, respectively. The basis set contains plane
waves with kinetic energy up to 400 eV. The integration in the reciprocal
space is performed on a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack
grid, which reflects the symmetry of the supercell.30 Convergence tests show that neither larger basis sets nor
denser k-meshes result in an improved description.a To provide consistency with previous investigations
of LiNbO3, we choose the PW91 description of the exchange
correlation potential.31 The same argument
holds for the choice of the DFT-D2 functional by Grimme et al.32 to describe dispersion interactions at the surface.

Table 1 shows the
influence of the van der Waals functional on the absorption energies
and the adsorption distance of H2O molecules calculated
exemplarily at the negative surface of LN. All the functionals result
in an enhanced adsorption energy, showing that van der Waals forces
substantially contribute to the bonding between H2O and
the substrate. The choice of a more recent functional is expected
to give similar results.

Surface calculations within periodic boundary conditions
are performed
by inclusion of a vacuum layer of 20 Å, which strongly reduces
the interaction between different periodic images. The length of the
vacuum layer ensures energy differences between different adsorption
configurations to be converged within 1 meV. Due to the magnitude
of the vacuum layer, the effect of dipole corrections46,47 is minor and amounts to, for example, 10–4 eV
for the H2O adsorption energy.

Three LiNbO3 trilayers of LN Z-cut,
the surface termination, and all adsorbates sit on top of three fixed
trilayers of LN, which model the bulk material. Making use of the
conjugate gradient algorithm, the relaxation of atoms is performed
until the Hellmann–Feynman forces are smaller than 0.02 eV/Å.
The total energy of molecules in the gas phase is calculated in a
supercell with dimensions of 10 × 11 × 12 Å3, using the Γ-point for the reciprocal space sampling. This
procedure allows to reproduce the adsorption energies of a previous
study,14 which are given by 1  

A negative sign in the adsorption energy indicates the adsorbed
state being preferred over the nonadsorbed state. Adsorption energies
are calculated using a 1 × 1 surface unit cell, which yields
adsorption energies converged within 15 meV with respect to a 2 ×
2 or a 3 × 3 surface unit cell, which yield the same value. The
adsorption configurations are determined either on the basis of previous
results11,14 or by testing different adsorption geometries.

Potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the adsorption of different
molecules or fragments are calculated constraining the lateral coordinates
of the oxygen atom of the adsorbate and allowing the remaining degrees
of freedom to relax. We have thereby evaluated the adsorption energy
on a rectangular mesh for 56 possible positions.

To model water-covered
LiNbO3 (0001) surfaces, we consider
the effect of water on the substrate. It is known that H2O enhances the LiNbO3 surface roughness.14 Furthermore, in a water environment, the positively polarized
surface (electron doped) tends to attract OH–, while
the negatively polarized surface (hole doped) attracts H+. Thus, we qualitatively model the aqueous environment by placing
water fragments on the perfect LiNbO3 surfaces. The water
fragments are placed according to the configurations we have determined
in a previous investigation.11 Although
this approach represents a crude approximation that does not allow
for a quantitative estimate of the overpotentials, it represents a
step toward more realistic conditions and allows a qualitative description
of the effect of the aqueous environment. We want to remark that our
approach includes further simplifications that may lead to deviations
from real systems. Apart from the mentioned water fragments, we model
the ideal surfaces of lithium niobate without nanodomains, defects,
dislocations, and impurities, occurring in real samples. They might
provide highly active catalytic sites, enhancing the efficiency of
perfect surfaces. We simulate the reactions with a solid–gas
model, which does involve neither partial or multiple coverage nor
the coexistence of different adsorbates. Solvation effects are omitted
as well.

Thermodynamic Approach
The description of chemical
reactivity involves the estimation of the energy barrier corresponding
to a chemical reaction (influencing a reaction’s time constant)
and the energy difference between products and educts. The relevant
thermodynamic potential for chemical reactions is the Gibbs free energy G(p,T). Its differences
during a reaction can be calculated in the theory by No̷rskov
et al.48 by means of 2  including the terms  to correct differences in Gibbs
free energy
due to the application of an electric potential or a different pH
value. ΔEtot, TΔS, and ΔEZPE denote the differences in DFT total energies, entropic contributions,
and zero-point energies, respectively. The latter two terms determine
the contributions to free energy F(T,V), which are not included in Etot. While an additional summand p·V is still needed to convert F(T,V) to Gibbs free energy, its influence
at realistic pressures is very small and thus negligible.49 Additionally, we neglect the entropic contributions
to eq 2. Their influence
at metal oxide surfaces has been shown to be small, for example, at
RuO2 (110) surfaces for different oxygen partial pressures9 and at TiO2 (110) surfaces for the
OER.25 Furthermore, this term is expected
to be of similar magnitude for both LN (0001) orientations, and we
focus here on the difference between differently polarized surfaces.
Therefore, we calculate reaction energy differences in a simplified
fashion as 3  

In this way, the computational
effort is reduced and systems of the size investigated in this work
become accessible. This approach has proven to be more suitable than
traditional ways to include neglected terms that tend “to use
oversimplified treatments of entropic contributions”.50 A change of the pH value or of the potential
influences the Gibbs free energies and equilibrium potentials equally.51 Therefore, the overpotential is not dependent
on those terms.

Within Nørskov’s framework, coupled
proton–electron
transfers (CPET) are considered. Furthermore, we employ the “numerical”
hydrogen electrode as reference, meaning that the reaction  is in equilibrium, and its
Gibbs free energy
difference is ΔG = 0 by definition. Consequently,
the energy of proton–electron pairs in subsequent reaction
pathways can be accounted for via . The overpotential η is estimated
for the OER by the difference between the largest ΔG and the commonly accepted water (to oxygen) oxidation potential
to be 1.23 eV.52 In the case of the HER,
the overpotential corresponds to the largest ΔG, as the corresponding potential is by definition 0.00 eV.

Results
OER
We investigate the OER of the water splitting reaction
using the “associative” reaction mechanism48,53 (reactions A–D) as the model reaction. Other reaction pathways
are possible.54 However, their investigation
exceeds the scope of this paper. The oxidation reaction is assumed
to have a peroxide intermediate OOH adsorbed to the surface.25 As pointed out by Valdés et al.,25 the recombination of two adjacent oxygen atoms
is associated with a large activation barrier.55 X* denotes molecule X adsorbed at the surface. A   B   C   D  

Following
the approach
outlined in the previous section, we determine the adsorption geometry
of each molecule (Figure 2) and calculate the energy difference between each step at
both the positive and the negative LN surfaces. For each surface,
the results are depicted by the blue lines in Figure 3. Reaction A is associated with the largest energy difference,
which therefore determines the overpotential η. The overpotentials
on the positive and negative surfaces amount to 2.08 and 1.22 eV,
respectively. Finally, the application of a bias voltage with the
potential required to overcome the largest energy difference makes
the reaction possible as depicted by the green lines in Figure 3. The required potential is
larger on the positive surface than on the negative surface, which
makes the OER more feasible for the latter surface.

surface. From left to right, H2O*, OH*, O*, OOH*, and O2*. Color coding as in Figure 1. Small white spheres denote hydrogen atoms. The surface
unit cell is indicated by black lines. The adsorbates are hidden in
the gray shaded area to highlight adsorption-induced structural changes.
The OOH* has a tilted structure shown in the inset (the location of
the gray plane is indicated by the a−b line).

Figure 3 Comparison of Gibbs free energy profile for the OER at
the pristine
polar LN surfaces. The horizontal axis depicts reactions A–D. Evaluating eq 3 with zero overpotential
or minimal necessary overpotential results in the blue and green curves,
respectively.

The calculated overpotential
of 1.22 V for the OER at the LN (0001̅)
surface is comparable with the values calculated for excellent catalysts
such as Pt (111) (1.32 V53), s-triazene
based graphitic carbon nitride (0.93 V52), and rutile TiO2 (110) (0.78 V25) or RuO2 (110) (0.64 V26).
However, while for rutile such values are achieved for surfaces fully
covered with oxygen or for strongly defective surfaces, the values
calculated for LiNbO3 correspond to defect-free non-precovered
surfaces. The catalytic activity of the clean surfaces is thus not
related to surface modifications but is an inherent surface property,
which might be further enhanced by nanoscale structuring or chemical
treatment.

HER
The HER, which is the reduction
of protons to molecular
hydrogen, is somewhat simpler. The transfer processes of two electrons
must be considered. E   F  

Again, the adsorption
geometries (shown in Figure 4) and afterward the Gibbs free energy profiles are determined
(Figure 5). The blue
lines show the case of no external bias voltage. The adsorption of
the first hydrogen atom results in the rate-determining step with
the largest energy difference for both surfaces. The adsorption of
the second hydrogen atom is associated with a negative energy difference,
indicating a spontaneous reaction progression. The difference in the
Gibbs free energy profiles of the entire HER process (i.e., before
and after reactions E and F) corresponds to the H2 adsorption
energy, which represents the difference in the adsorption energies
of educts and products. This has been verified by explicitly calculationg
the H2 adsorption energy.

Figure 4 Adsorbates in reactions E and F adsorbed at the
positive LN surface:
H* (left-hand side) and H2* (right-hand side). Color coding
as in Figure 2. The
surface unit cell is indicated by black lines. The adsorbates are
hidden in the gray shaded area to highlight adsorption-induced structural
changes.

Figure 5 Comparison of Gibbs free energy profile for
the HER at the clean
polar LN surfaces. The horizontal axis represents the reaction coordinate
according to reactions E and F. Evaluating eq 3 with zero overpotential or minimal necessary
overpotential results in the blue and green curves, respectively.
The Gibbs free energy difference of the entire HER in the case of
zero bias voltage corresponds to the H2 adsorption energy.

Choosing the numerical hydrogen
electrode as the reference potential
allows to express the difference in Gibbs free energy by means of
the difference in adsorption energy. Thus, the overpotential on the
positive surface is 0.39 eV, while we get a value of 0.61 eV for the
negative surface. The HER is more feasible on the positive LN surface
due to the smaller overpotential and becomes exoenergetic by application
of an external voltage of about 0.4 eV (green lines in Figure 5).

The calculated overpotential
for the HER is noticeable. On the
one hand, its very low value makes the pristine LN (0001) surface
an excellent catalyst. For comparison, the HER overpotential calculated
for s-triazene based graphitic carbon nitride amounts to 0.82 V.52 On the other hand, this value is rather different
from the overpotential needed for the OER. Even if remarkable, this
difference must not be surprising, as differently polarized LiNbO3 surfaces are known to be morphologically and chemically very
different.

Energy Barrier
The results concerning
OER and HER shown
in Figures 3 and 5 give only a partial picture of the energetics of reactions A–F. Energy barriers may indeed separate the intermediate
reactions. To further investigate this issue, we employ the nudged
elastic band (NEB) method to get an insight into the energy landscape.
We make use of six images that are initially equidistantly distributed
along the reaction coordinate that transforms the state of an absorbed
H2O* and the state of dissociative adsorption OH* + H*
in the multidimensional configuration space. This is the first part
or step A in reaction A. The calculated barrier represents the energy potential that must
be overcome by H2O from a metastable adsorption mode to
a more stable mode, which is the dissociative adsorption known for
other polar oxides.56 This interpolation
has been done carefully to exclude an artificial translation of molecules
along the surface to equivalent adsorption sites (from rotational
or translational symmetry). The result after convergence to the minimum
energy path (MEP) is shown in the left-hand side of Figure 6. Although the final state
is even lower in energy by about 0.02 eV, a barrier of nearly 0.18
eV has to be overcome. The saddle point in the configuration space
is characterized by a 90° rotation of the water molecule around
one hydrogen–oxygen bond, with the other hydrogen atom pointing
out of the surface plane. The first hydrogen points to the oxygen
atom of the surface termination (due to a hydrogen bond), which moves
approximately 0.48 Å toward the hydrogen atom. In the final state,
the separated hydrogen atom bonds to the oxygen of the surface termination.
The barrier is quite small compared to the energy differences calculated
in the previous section. It is only about 7% of the Gibbs free energy
difference of reaction A. We can thus conclude that energy barriers do not have a substantial
effect on the reaction kinetics of this step.

Figure 6 Minimum energy paths
derived from reaction A divided into a dissociation part (left-hand
side) and a desorption part (right-hand side). Insets depict the atomic
geometry for selected points along the MEP, showing the top view (left
figure) or the side view (right figure) of the outmost Li–O
termination and the adsorbates (color coding as in Figure 2). An additional inset on the
left-hand side displays the barrier at the same energy scale as in
the right figure.

We investigate a second
reaction path that describes the second
step of reaction A, the
removal of a hydrogen atom beginning from the final state of the last
pathway (OH* + H* → OH* + H), and makes reaction A complete. We want to remark that this is
not the barrier associated with the deprotonation. The latter is the
energy needed by H+ to go to the solvent via the collective
effect of H2O molecules nearby. As the desorption of H+ occurs only by the help of dative bonding from nearby water
molecules, which are absent in our model, the deprotonation barrier
would not be accessible within our approach. We rather test whether
removing an hydrogen from the surface requires overcoming an energy
barrier. The H atom is considered as separated from the surface when
its distance from the topmost surface atom is higher than 6 Å.
At that distance, the interaction energy becomes negligible. The result
is presented in the right-hand side of Figure 6. The corresponding MEP does not have a saddle
point, that is, an energy corresponding exactly to the difference
between initial and final state that is necessary for the removal
of the hydrogen. In the configuration space, the hydrogen moves mostly
perpendicular to the surface, while the remaining surface results
in the geometry of OH* (see Figure 2). Also, the energy difference between the initial
and final state compares well to the first reaction’s Gibbs
free energy difference after subtracting the energy corresponding
to the removed hydrogen. The largest contribution to the overpotential
is thus due to the interaction of H and the LN surface in this step
rather than to the stability of the H2O molecule itself.

In conclusion, the water splitting reactions on clean LiNbO3 surfaces are not hindered by additional energy barriers beyond
the energy difference between the distinct adsorption configurations.

Secondary Water Adsorption
The presence of a large
energy barrier makes the recombination of O* + O* → O2* unlikely.55 This results in the formation
of an unusual OOH* peroxide complex by integration of a second water
molecule in the third CPET (reaction C). This CPET can occur either before or after the interaction
of secondary H2O molecules with O*. Thus, either a deprotonation
(of H2O) with subsequent adsorption OH + O* → OOH*
or an adsorption H2O + O* → H2O2* with subsequent deprotonation may occur. Which reaction path actually
occurs is still a matter of debate. This question is of rather general
nature, as it also arises considering alternative reaction paths.

We address this open question for the water splitting reaction on
LiNbO3. Therefore, we calculate the PES of the adsorption
of H2O and OH on the precovered surface. We restrict the
investigation to the negative surface, where the OER is more likely
to occur. We define the position of the adsorbate by keeping the lateral
coordinates of the corresponding oxygen atom constant. All other degrees
of freedom are relaxed. The energy landscape plots are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 PESs showing favorable
and unfavorable adsorption sites for OH
(left-hand side) and H2O (right-hand side) on the negative
LN surface precovered with O*. Color coding as in Figure 1. The solid and the dashed
circles in each PES correspond to adsorption scenarios (a) and (b)
described in the main text, respectively.

Two main different adsorption geometry scenarios are predicted:
(a) The second molecule (either H2O or OH) adsorbs on the
surface and interacts with the already adsorbed oxygen atom to build
the peroxide complex. (b) The second molecule adsorbs on the surface
without interacting with the already adsorbed oxygen (e.g., due to
the lateral distance), and the peroxide complex is not formed. Other
adsorption configurations characterized by large adsorption energies
are not further discussed.

In the case of OH as an adsorbate,
the global minimum of the PES
(represented by a dashed circle on the left-hand side of Figure 7) corresponds to
an energy of −3.65 eV and an adsorption geometry of scenario
(b), which does not result in the assumed peroxide intermediate. The
lowest point on the energy landscape, where OOH is built, is denoted
by the solid circle. This point is associated with an energy of −2.79
eV, which is less favorable by 0.86 eV.

In the case of H2O as an adsorbate instead, the global
minimum (−1.60 eV) corresponds to a type (b) adsorption geometry,
while the type (a) scenario (energy of −1.34 eV) is energetically
less favorable by 0.26 eV. In summary, we conclude that the formation
of the OOH peroxide complex is easier after adsorption of H2O than of OH and the CPET takes place after H2O adsorption.

HER and OER in Aqueous Solution
Ferroelectric surfaces
have a diverging electrostatic surface energy due to the presence
of a nonzero dipole moment on all the unit cells throughout the material.57 Different mechanisms occur to reduce the electrostatic
instability. While inner compensation mechanisms such as surface relaxation
and reconstructions (both considered in our models) take place in
UHV, external compensation mechanisms such as the adsorption of molecules
and fragments available from the environment might further contribute
to compensate the polarization charges at ambient conditions. This
might deeply modify the surface chemistry. In particular, in a water
environment, the positively polarized surface (electron doped) tends
to become OH– terminated, while the negatively polarized
surface (hole doped) becomes H+ terminated. Thus, LN surfaces
under experimental conditions might differ from the previously discussed
pristine LN surfaces. To verify the effect of the aqueous solution
on the water splitting reaction, we model water-covered LiNbO3 surfaces as described in the Methods and
Models.

The results are shown in Figures 8 and 9. They demonstrate
that the water splitting reaction at the LiNbO3 ferroelectric
surfaces under experimentally relevant conditions is very different
from the idealized situation modeling clean surfaces. The presence
of water levels and substantially raises the overpotentals needed
to drive the reactions and even inverts the favorable surface for
the OER and HER. The smallest overpotential for HER in aqueous conditions
is found at the negative surface and amounts to 1.2 V [for clean surfaces,
it was 0.4 V at the LN (0001)], while the smallest overpotential for
OER amounts to 1.1 V, substantially the same value as for pristine
surfaces, however, at the positive surface. The low overpotential
for the OER at the positive surface of different catalysts in aqueous
conditions has been explained by the enhanced oxygen availability,
due to the presence of the OH fragments.

energy profile for the OER at the polar
LN surfaces modified to account for aqueous conditions. The horizontal
axis depicts the reaction coordinate according to reactions A–D. Evaluating eq 3 with
zero overpotential or minimal necessary overpotential results in the
blue and green curves, respectively.

LN surfaces modified to account for aqueous conditions. The horizontal
axis represents the reaction coordinate according to reactions E and F. Evaluating eq 3 with
zero overpotential or minimal necessary overpotential results in the
blue and green curves, respectively. The Gibbs free energy difference
of the entire HER in the case of zero bias voltage corresponds to
the H2 adsorption energy.

The calculated values suggest that ferroelectric LiNbO3 surfaces under experimental conditions still have a catalytic
function;
however, the expected efficiency is not higher than that reported,
for example, for rutile. This explains why excellent catalytic performances
are only obtained for LiNbO3 nanowires or finely milled
crystals,24,58 while the bulk counterpart does not show
an outstanding catalytic efficiency.

Band Alignment
To achieve water splitting, the catalyst
must be able to drive the HER and the OER. In particular, the conduction
band must be located above the HER potential, so that (photo)excited
electrons from the conduction band can take part to the lower lying
HER reaction. Also, the valence band must be located below the OER
potential so that holes from the valence band may become available
for the OER. Shortly, the reaction potentials must be inside the LiNbO3 band edges.

Figure 10 compares the potential of the valence and conduction
bands of LiNbO3 with the potentials of the oxidation of
water and hydrogen reduction located as previously discussed at 1.23
and 0.00 V, respectively (Figure 10, left-hand side). This corresponds in the more common
absolute scale (Figure 10, right-hand side) to −5.67 and −4.44 eV. To
determine the position of the LiNbO3 band edges on this
scale, we use the ionization energy ΔΦ, which corresponds
to the energy necessary to bring an electron from the valence band
edge to infinity (vacuum level). Concerning clean surfaces (black
lines in Figure 10), both measurements59 and calculations8 estimate the ionization potentials to ΔΦ+ = 6.5 eV for the positive and ΔΦ– = 4.9 eV for the negative surface, respectively. This marks the
position of the valence band in the absolute scale. Assuming a band
gap of 3.78 eV, the conduction band is placed at −2.72 eV (−1.12
eV) for the positive (negative) surface. Thus, the oxidation and reduction
potentials are within the band gap in the case of the positive surface,
while only the hydrogen reaction potential is within the LiNbO3 band gap. Considering the overpotentials, the positive surface
can efficiently drive the HER, but the valence band holes at the negative
surface cannot oxidize water. Although it does not mean that the reaction
will not take place,b this fact strongly reduces
the catalytic efficiency of LN ideal surfaces.

in aqueous solutions (red lines) in relation to the redox reactions
of water splitting. The relative electrode potentials are converted
into electronic energies following the standard convention for aqueous
systems.60

The presence of water modifies the ionization energy and
thus the
relative position of the vacuum level and band edges.14 As a consequence of the adsorbate-to-surface electron transfer
at the positive surface, the work function is increased by roughly
0.49 eV at the positive surface, while it is reduced by 0.34 eV at
the negative surface, as a consequence of the surface-to-adsorbate
electronic charge transfer. The new band alignment is shown in the
right part of Figure 10 (red lines). Although the band shift is not negligible, it does
not drastically modify the situation described for pristine surfaces.
While the positive surface remains a very good catalyst for the HER
(and also for the OER, which becomes feasible in the water environment),
the negative surface cannot efficiently drive the OER.

Conclusions
This manuscript presents density functional based simulations of
the water splitting on clean ferroelectric LN surfaces and in aqueous
solution, calculated by model OER and HER mechanisms following the
theory by No̷rskov et al.48

In the case of clean surfaces, the oxidation (reduction) reaction
has the lowest overpotential on the negative (positive) surface and
is therefore more likely to proceed. This fits perfectly to the picture
that the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials drives
photogenerated charge carriers to the polar surfaces (electrons to
the positive, holes to the negative surface), making injection or
removal of electrons easier than in less chemically strained systems.
Using the NEB method, we ruled out that additional reaction barriers
hinder the first reaction steps, which determine the overpotential
on LN surfaces. The secondary water adsorption was analyzed by means
of potential energy maps, which indicate that the adsorption of a
water molecule prior to the deprotonation is more likely to happen
than vice versa.

Under experimental conditions (i.e., in aqueous
solution), the
calculated overpotentials are substantially higher than in UHV, representing
a serious constraint for the catalytic efficiency of LiNbO3 crystals. Furthermore, contrary to the water splitting on clean
surfaces, the OER is favored at the positive surface and the HER at
the negative surface. It seems that the water-covered LN (0001) surfaces
are too stable in the investigated neutral case to lead to an efficient
water splitting. This explains why the observed outstanding catalytic
activity of LiNbO3 is only achieved for nanostructured
or finely milled samples,58 where step
edges and defects may provide catalytically active sites.

The
determination of the active sites efficiently catalyzing the
water splitting reaction will be the crucial goal for future investigations,
as it may allow to produce tailored structures of large surface area
with high density of active sites. Similarly, further work has to
be dedicated to band engineering. Substituting Nb cations (e.g., with
Ta or further transition metals), it might be possible to tailor the
band edges. Tuning the position of the latter with respect to the
standard oxygen and hydrogen potentials, the OER at the negative surface
could become possible. Combining the knowledge about active catalytic
sites and band alignment, highly efficient LiNbO3-based
catalyst for water splitting might be designed.
