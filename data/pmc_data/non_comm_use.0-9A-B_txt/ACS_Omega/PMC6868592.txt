Enantiomerically
pure tailor-made amino acids are in extremely
high demand in nearly every sector of the health-related industries.
In particular, the rapidly growing number of amino-acid-based pharmaceuticals
calls for the development of advanced synthetic approaches featuring
practicality and commercial viability. Here we provide a brief summary
of the development of axially chiral tridentate Hamari ligands and
their application for general asymmetric synthesis of various structural
types of amino acids. The methodological diversity includes: dynamic
kinetic resolution and (S)-/(R)-interconversion
of unprotected amino acids and homologation of nucleophilic glycine
equivalents via alkyl halide alkylation reactions as well as multiple-step
transformations allowing preparation of polyfunctional and cyclic
derivatives. The practicality of these methods is critically discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Amino acids (AAs) are
among a few fundamental “building
blocks of life” and have played a significant role in drug
discovery from the earliest days of modern pharmaceutical science.
Specially designed, tailor-made AAs are indispensable components of
modern medicinal chemistry and are becoming increasingly prominent
in new pharmaceuticals and medical formulations. Moreover, the growing
recognition of peptides and peptidomimetics as preferred drugs evidently
advocates for the growing role of tailor-made AAs in the modern pharmaceutical
industry.1 The synthesis of AAs is a well-developed
discipline offering a plethora of various methodological approaches.
Nonetheless, from the standpoint of practicality, there still is an
urgent need for the development of advanced synthetic methods suitable
for large-scale production of tailor-made AAs of high chemical and
enantiomeric purity.2 In this mini-review,
we would like to acquaint the readers with the most recent developments
in the field dealing with the design of new chiral nucleophilic glycine
equivalents as versatile reagents for general asymmetric synthesis
of tailor-made AAs. In particular, we focus on the chiral Hamari ligands
and glycine derivatives, as the most promising reagents for large-scale
practical solutions.

2 Versatility of Synthetic
Application of Nucleophilic
Glycine Equivalents
The use of Schiff bases of glycine derivatives 1 (Figure 1) for the synthesis
of AAs was introduced by the Stork group in 1976.3 Since then, these derivatives have been fully appreciated
as a preferred type of nucleophilic glycine equivalent. Features such
as structural simplicity, ready availability, high C–H acidity,
and chemical versatility are very synthetically attractive, especially
from the standpoint of practicality.

Figure 1 Achiral 1 and chiral 2 and 3 equivalents of nucleophilic glycine.

Most notably, chiral Schiff base modifications 2 and 3 were reported in 1976 by Yamada4 and in 1983 by Belokon5 groups, correspondingly.
The latter, square-planar Ni(II) complex 3 was shown
(Scheme 1) to serve
as a chiral nucleophilic glycine equivalent in reactions with numerous
electrophilic reagents.6

Scheme 1 Versatility of Chiral
Nucleophilic Glycine Equivalent 3 for the Preparation
of Tailor-Made AAs of General Types 4–13
Most typically used reaction
types are represented by alkyl halide
alkylations 4,7 dialkylations 5,8 secondary alkyl halide alkylations 6,9 and bisalkylations 7(10) and aldol 8,11 Mannich 9,12 and Michael 10(13) addition
reactions. Multiple step processes, like addition–cyclization,
leading to pyroglutamic acids 11,14 β-substituted prolines 12,15 and derivatives of 1-amino-2-vinylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic
acid 13(16) can also be conveniently
performed.

However, despite this extraordinary synthetic versatility
of glycine
complex 3, the potential of its application for large-scale
synthesis of tailor-made AAs is rather limited due to the practically
unsatisfactory levels of stereocontrol (∼90% de), partial racemization
of the proline moiety, and problematic isolation of the target AAs.

3 New Generation of Chiral Schiff Base Glycine
Ni(II) Complexes
Over the last five years, significant progress
has been made in
the design of structurally novel chiral tridentate ligands and the
corresponding Ni(II) complexes, allowing us to address the synthetic
shortcomings of complex 3. As presented in Figure 2, proline-derived complexes 14(17) and 15(18) show noticeably improved diastereoselectivity
in the reactions with electrophiles. Furthermore, the trichloro derivative 14 can be used for the preparation of β-AAs. However,
under strongly basic reaction conditions, complexes 14 and 15 are prone to racemization at the proline moiety,
limiting their practical application

Figure 2 Structures of structurally novel chiral
nucleophilic glycine equivalents,
available in both enantiomeric forms.

The structural type of complex 16,19 possessing a stereogenic nitrogen, racemization-stable
secondary amine moiety, and an extremely lipophilic adamantyl group,
offers an exceptionally practical solution for the preparation of
AAs via a rare case of second-order asymmetric transformation control.
Nonetheless, the synthetic range of complex 16 is limited
to mostly aromatic AA types. The most exciting success in the structural
design of new chiral ligands and the corresponding glycine complexes
has been achieved with the recent development of (3Z,5Z)-2,7-dihydro-1H-azepine-derived
Ni(II) 17.20 Similar to the
new generation of nucleophilic glycine equivalents 14, 15, and 16, the Hamari-Gly complex 17 allows us to achieve very high levels of diastereocontrol
(up to >99:1) reproducible on the large scale. However, the major
advantage of reagent 17 is the indestructible axial chirality,
affording unlimited recycling and reuse of the chiral auxiliary. This
particular feature renders the whole process, in terms of the cost
and efficiency, comparable to or superior over catalytic and biocatalytic
approaches.

4 Design and Large-Scale Synthesis of Chiral Tridentate
(R)- and (S)-Hamari Ligands
The recently reported large-scale synthesis of Hamari ligand 23 is presented in Scheme 2. The process begins with esterification of enantiomerically
pure BINOL 18 by the action of Tf2O. The activated
ester 19 is reacted next with MeMgI to afford dimethyl
derivative 20 with quantitative yield. The subsequent
radical bromination gives rise to the dibromo intermediate 21 with a moderate 71% yield.20

Scheme 2 Large-Scale
(kg) Synthesis of the Hamari Ligand (R)- or (S)-23
(a) Tf2O, pyridine,
toluene. (b) NiCl2(dppp)2, MeMgI, MTBE. (c)
1,3-Dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, AIBN, ethyl acetate. (d) Na2CO3, iPrOAc.

The final step of the process is the alkylation of the specially
designed glycine-o-amino-benzophenone adduct 22 using dibromide 21. The reaction is conducted
in isopropyl acetate using aqueous sodium carbonate as a base. The
resulting Hamari ligand 23 is isolated by filtration
as a pale-yellow solid with 93% yield. Using this procedure, the Hamari
ligand 23 can be prepared on a kilogram scale in both
(S)- and (R)-enantiomeric forms.20

5 Dynamic Kinetic Resolution
and (S)-/(R)-Interconversion of
Unprotected α-AAs
One of the notable applications of
Hamari ligand 23 is the dynamic kinetic resolution of
unprotected amino acids. The
overall process, presented in Scheme 3, includes the formation of Ni(II) complex intermediates 25 followed by their disassembly to release the target AAs 24 and recycling of the ligand 23.21

Scheme 3 Asymmetric Preparation of AAs and Their
α-Deuterated Derivatives
via Chemical Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and (S)-/(R)-Interconversion of Unprotected α-AAs
The first step of the process, the reaction
of Hamari ligand 23 with racemic AAs, is conducted in
methanol under moderate
heating (60–70 °C) in the presence of Ni(OAc)2 and K2CO3. This step includes in situ formation of the corresponding Schiff base and ionization of the
amide and carboxylic groups followed by chelation of the Ni(II) ions
into square-planar complexes 25. Under the basic reaction
conditions, the α-stereogenic carbon is relatively configurationally
unstable, allowing for thermodynamic control of the diastereomeric
preferences, giving rise to (R)-absolute configuration
of the amino acid in complexes with (S)-axial chirality
and, correspondingly, (S)-AA 24 induced
by (R)-axial chirality. The diastereoselectivity
is slightly dependent on the AA side chain and varies between 95 and
97% de. Diastereomeric enrichment to >99% de usually takes place
at
the workup stage by precipitation of products 25 from
aqueous methanol solutions. The chemical yields range from 95% to
quantitative. The structural generality of this method is exceptionally
high as polyfunctional AAs containing OH, NH2, COOH, and
S-Me groups can be used without any additional protection. About 50
examples of structurally diverse AAs have been successfully prepared
so far in enantiomerically pure form using this method.22 Disassembly of complexes 25 is
conducted by heating in HCl/MeOH, affording target AAs 24 along with recovery of chemically and stereochemically uncompromised
chiral ligand 23. Importantly, this method for chemical
dynamic kinetic resolution and (S)-/(R)-interconversion of unprotected α-AAs can be successfully
used for preparation of the corresponding α-deuterated derivatives 26, a very useful special type of isotopically labeled AAs
for mechanistic studies. The required modification is a simple application
of deuterated methanol at the stage of complex 25 formation,
allowing for up to 90% of the deuteration in the α-position.23

6 Synthesis of Chiral Hamari-Gly
and Its Asymmetric
Alkylations
Another avenue of application of Hamari ligands
(S)- and (R)-23 for
general asymmetric
synthesis of tailor-made AAs is their transformation to the corresponding
glycine Schiff base complexes 17 followed by their homologation
with various electrophiles.24 As presented
in Scheme 4, in the
presence of base, Hamari ligand 23 reacts with glycine
and a source of Ni(II) ions, forming the square-planar Hamari-Gly
complex 17 with over 95% yield.

Scheme 4 General Asymmetric
Synthesis of Tailor-Made AAs via Alkylation of
Hamari-Gly 17
Due to the very high reactivity of the glycine methylene in complex 17, the alkyl halide alkylations can be conducted in NaOMe/MeOH
at ambient temperature. These conditions are limited to activated
alkyl halides; however, the observed diastereoselectivity is exceptionally
high (∼99:1), allowing for a convenient preparation of various
aromatic and heteroaromatic tailor-made AAs. A more general alkylation
protocol is currently under development and shall include polar aprotic
solvent and strong inorganic bases as shown (vide infra) in the example
of the asymmetric synthesis of α-(methyl)cysteine derivatives.

7 Asymmetric Synthesis of (2S)- and (2R)-α-(Methyl)cysteine Derivatives
Construction
of the stereogenic quaternary carbon in α,α-disubstituted
AAs usually entails investigation of two possible approaches based
on which of the two side chains is introduced first. As shown in Scheme 5, asymmetric synthesis
of α-(methyl)cysteine can be accomplished by methylation of
cysteine Schiff base complex 30 or thiomethylation of
alanine-derived complex 32.

Scheme 5 Two Alkylation Options
for the Construction of Quaternary of (2S)- and (2R)-α-(Methyl)cysteine Derivatives
Using Hamari Ligand 23
In the first line of inquiry, the Hamari ligand 23 was reacted with S-protected racemic cysteine 28 to
produce the corresponding Schiff base Ni(II) complex 30. Quite unexpectedly, attempts to methylate complex 30 under basic conditions resulted in nearly quantitative formation
of dehydroalanine derivative 31. It was found that the
corresponding enolate derived from 30 undergoes a rapid
stabilization by ejecting the S-CH2–Ph
anion, giving rise to dehydroalanine complex 31.25 The second approach via formation of the intermediate
alanine Schiff base complex 32 was rather successful.
The thiomethylation of 32 with reagent 33 was conducted in DMF using NaOH as base. α-(Methyl)cysteine
derivative 34 was isolated with up to 75% yield and about
9:1 diastereomeric ratio. While the observed level of the stereochemical
outcome, from the general standpoint, is rather moderate, it is on
par or better with literature examples on this type of asymmetric
alkylation. Moreover, this method has a significant advantage of operationally
convenient and scalable reaction conditions. Furthermore, the diastereomeric
purity of 34 can be increased by crystallization of the
crude product. The target AA was isolated from diastereomerically
pure complex 34 with >95% yield and >99% ee. Once
again,
it should be emphasized that the Hamari ligand was recovered stereochemically
intact. In general, α-(methyl)cysteine is difficult to obtain
by other methods, and the current interest in this tailor-made AA
is derived from its application in the design of a new generation
of histone deacetylase inhibitors as emerging therapeutics for cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma.

8 Asymmetric Synthesis of (1R,2S)-1-Amino-2-vinylcyclopropanecarboxylic
Acid
Another example of the Hamari ligand application for
asymmetric
synthesis of tailor-made AAs is illustrated (Scheme 6) by the preparation of structurally complex
(1R,2S)-1-amino-2-vinylcyclopropanecarboxylic
acid, the essential pharmacophoric unit in a new generation of highly
potent hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitors. As presented
in Scheme 6, the whole
process includes two steps via SN2 and SN2′
alkylation. Taking advantage of activating the allylic reactivity
of dibromide 36, the first SN2 alkylation
step was conducted under very mild phase-transfer catalysis (PTC)
conditions, allowing the preparation of intermediate 37 with over 90% yield.26

Scheme 6 Asymmetric Synthesis
of (1R,2S)-1-Amino-2-vinylcyclopropanecarboxylic
Acid 39 via the SN2 and SN2′
Alkylation Sequence of the Hamari-Gly Complex (S)-17
The second step, the internal
SN2′ alkylation
of 37 to 38, was conducted under more basic
reaction conditions using THF as a solvent and NaO-t-Bu as a base. The reaction occurred with excellent yield (>90%)
and diastereoselectivity (>98% de). After the standard disassembly
procedure, the target AA 39 was isolated, as the N-Boc derivative, in enantiomerically pure form (>99%
ee),
along with the recovery and recycling of the Hamari ligand (S)-23.26 It should
be mentioned that the obtained values of the stereochemical outcome
are actually the highest reported in the literature for this type
of internal SN2′ cyclizations.

9 Conclusions
We trust that the data briefly presented here on the chemistry
of recently developed chiral Hamari ligands and Hamari-Gly complexes
convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of these compounds
for general asymmetric synthesis of tailor-made AAs. The overall low
cost of this approach is provided by virtually unlimited recyclability
of the ligands due to their configurational stability. The operational
ease of all transformations coupled with its predictable reactivity
and stereochemical outcome in complex settings bode well for the widespread
application of the Hamari ligand technology.
