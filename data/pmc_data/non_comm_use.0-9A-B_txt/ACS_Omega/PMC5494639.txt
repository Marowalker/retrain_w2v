ExoU is a 74 kDa
cytotoxin that undergoes substantial conformational
changes as part of its function, that is, it has multiple thermodynamically
stable conformations that interchange depending on its environment.
Such flexible proteins pose unique challenges to structural biology:
(1) not only is it often difficult to determine structures by X-ray crystallography
for all biologically relevant conformations because of the flat energy
landscape (2) but also experimental conditions can easily perturb
the biologically relevant conformation. The first challenge can be
overcome by applying orthogonal structural biology techniques that
are capable of observing alternative, biologically relevant conformations.
The second challenge can be addressed by determining the structure
in the same biological state with two independent techniques under
different experimental conditions. If both techniques converge to
the same structural model, the confidence that an unperturbed biologically
relevant conformation is observed increases. To this end, we determine
the structure of the C-terminal domain of the effector protein, ExoU,
from data obtained by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy
in conjunction with site-directed spin labeling and in silico de novo
structure determination. Our protocol encompasses a multimodule approach,
consisting of low-resolution topology sampling, clustering, and high-resolution
refinement. The resulting model was compared with an ExoU model in
complex with its chaperone SpcU obtained previously by X-ray crystallography.
The two models converged to a minimal RMSD100 of 3.2 Å, providing
evidence that the unbound structure of ExoU matches the fold observed
in complex with SpcU.

==== Body
Introduction
ExoU is a 74 kDa cytotoxin
encoded by Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.1−4 Using the type III secretion system, ExoU
is injected directly into eukaryotic cells, significantly increasing
the severity of the infection.5−7 Because of its function, ExoU
needs to undergo substantial conformational changes; that is, depending
on interaction partners and environment, different conformations of
the protein will be thermodynamically most stable. One conformation
of ExoU, in complex with its chaperone SpcU, has previously been elucidated
through X-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3TU3).2 This X-ray-derived model depicts ExoU as consisting of
four domains. The C-terminal domain is of particular interest because
it mediates the association of ExoU with the membrane,2,8,9 that is, it is expected to undergo
major conformational changes. However, all three structural models
obtained through X-ray crystallography (PDB entries 3TU3,24AKX,1 and 4QMK(8)) depict ExoU’s
C-terminal domain as exhibiting the same conformation, a four-helical
bundle. Experiments performed by Gendrin et al. showed that even the
presence of chaperone SpcU does not occlude the residues involved
in lipid binding.1 Through electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, Benson et al. provided evidence that
the presence of the substrate induces conformational changes in ExoU’s
C-terminal domain.10 Given the expected
intrinsic flexibility of this domain, we set out to (a) confirm that the
conformation of the C-terminal domain observed in the X-ray crystallography-derived
model in complex with its chaperone SpcU is consistent with structural
data observed for ExoU in solution, and (b) probe the structural dynamics
of this domain. We chose EPR spectroscopy in conjunction with site-directed
spin labeling (SDSL) in combination with computational de novo protein
folding to approach these questions.

EPR spectroscopy in conjunction
with SDSL provides an alternative
approach to probe the structure and dynamics of a protein. Briefly,
SDSL-EPR is typically employed to measure the distance between two
residues. To facilitate that, two cysteine residues are introduced
at the sites of interest into a cys-less variant of the protein and
coupled with S-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methyl methanesulfonothioate (MTSL), which
carries an unpaired electron. Through the double electron–electron
resonance (DEER) experiment,11,12 the distance-dependent
dipolar interaction of the two unpaired electrons can be measured
and translated into a distance distribution. Because every measurement
requires a distinct protein double mutant, the structural information
gained from SDSL-EPR experiments is typically too sparse to unambiguously
determine the protein’s tertiary structure. However, in conjunction
with de novo protein structure prediction methods, SDSL-EPR data could
focus the sampling on conformations that are in agreement with the
experimental data.

The computational protein structure prediction
pipeline employed
in this article is based on the de novo method BCL::Fold,13 which was specifically developed to predict
the tertiary structure of large proteins. To facilitate this objective,
the secondary structure elements (SSEs) of the protein are predicted
using machine learning methods. Conformations of the predicted SSEs
exhibiting idealized dihedral angles are subsequently arranged in
the three-dimensional space by a Monte Carlo Metropolis (MCM) algorithm.
The intermediary and final models are evaluated using knowledge-based
potentials that assign a pseudoenergy score to each model.14 Although this method has been successful at
de novo sampling the tertiary structure of large proteins, distinguishing
between accurate and inaccurate models based on their pseudoenergy
score alone remains a challenge.15 However,
it was demonstrated that incorporation of limited experimental data
significantly mitigates problems in model discrimination.16−19 The Rosetta method20,21 was used to add atomic detail
and energy-optimize the final models.

In this article, we discuss
the structure and dynamics of ExoU
and provide a benchmark evaluating the influence of SDSL-EPR data
on protein structure prediction. In the Results and
Discussion section, we detail the computational protein structure
prediction pipeline, describe the available SDSL-EPR data, compare
the prediction results to those from the X-ray-derived
model of ExoU, and evaluate the influence of SDSL-EPR data on de novo
protein structure prediction. In the Methods section, we describe the experimental approach used to obtain the
SDSL-EPR data.

Results and Discussion
Here, we
report the results of the de novo protein structure prediction
with and without the inclusion of SDSL-EPR data. The results were
evaluated for of sampling accuracy and discrimination of inaccurate
models as described above. We begin with an analysis of improvements
in sampling accuracy when SDSL-EPR data is incorporated into the protein
structure prediction algorithm. The influence of SDSL-EPR data on
the discrimination of inaccurate models is then considered. This section
starts with an outline of the benchmarking procedure that was used
to evaluate the influence of SDSL-EPR data on de novo protein structure
prediction accuracy. This outline is followed by sections providing
a detailed description of the protein structure prediction protocol,
an analysis of the available SDSL-EPR data for the C-terminal domain
of ExoU, and a description of the algorithm used to translate the
SDSL-EPR data into structural restraints that are usable by the prediction
algorithm. This section is concluded by an evaluation of the predicted
tertiary structure, its agreement with the X-ray-derived model and
a discussion of its consistency with the SDSL-EPR data.

Summary of
the Available SDSL-EPR Data for the C-Terminal Domain
of ExoU
For the C-terminal domain of ExoU, seven intradomain
SDSL-EPR distance measurements were available (see Table S1 and Figures S1 and 1B for details). The X-ray-derived model is in good
agreement with the restraints derived from the SDSL-EPR measurements,
as indicated by an average agreement score of −0.88 (Table S1, see the following section for details
regarding quantifying the agreement of models with the SDSL-EPR data).
Of the seven restraints, four are between α-helices 23 and 24,
one is between α-helices 22 and 23, one is between α-helix
23 and the loop region connecting α-helices 24 and 25, and one
is between α-helix 24 and the loop connecting α-helices
24 and 25. As shown in Figure 1B, the SDSL-EPR restraints well-describe the relative positions
of α-helices 23 and 24.

approach consisting of modules for secondary structure prediction,

as dashed lines) for the C-terminal domain of ExoU.

Summary of the Benchmark Setup To Evaluate
the Influence of
SDSL-EPR Data on De Novo Structure Prediction
The influence
of SDSL-EPR data on de novo protein structure prediction was evaluated
by performing two independent structure prediction runs, one with
incorporated SDSL-EPR data and one in the absence of SDSL-EPR data,
for the C-terminal domain of the effector protein, ExoU. The protocols
for both prediction runs were predominately identical, only differing
in the scoring function that was extended by a scoring term quantifying
the agreement of the model with the SDSL-EPR data for one prediction
run (see the following sections for details). For each prediction
run, about 100 000 low-resolution models and about 50 000
high-resolution full-atom models were sampled and subsequently analyzed
under the aspects of sampling accuracy and discrimination of inaccurate
models (see the following sections for details). A previously published
X-ray-derived model of ExoU (PDB entry 3TU3)2 was used
as a reference structure for evaluating the sampling accuracy and
model discrimination, the reported RMSD values are between the sampled
models and the X-ray-derived model of ExoU. However, no information
about the X-ray-derived model was used in the protein structure prediction
protocol.

Protein Structure Prediction Protocol
The protein structure
prediction protocol (see Figure 1A) consisted of two modules: a module for low-resolution
sampling of possible topologies and a module for the construction
of loop regions and high-resolution refinement of the resulting model.
The two modules were connected through a data aggregation step using
filtering and clustering. The low-resolution topology sampling was
performed iteratively: upon conclusion of the first iteration of the
low-resolution topology sampling, the most favorable models by pseudoenergy
score and agreement with the SDSL-EPR data (if applicable) were selected
as start models for a second round of optimization using the topology
sampling module.

In the first module (Procedures S1 and S2 for details), low-resolution topology sampling, the
secondary structure of the protein was predicted using PsiPred22,23 and Jufo9D.24 The resulting SSEs were
subsequently arranged in the three-dimensional space using the de
novo protein structure prediction algorithm, BCL::Fold.13 BCL::Fold employs an MCM algorithm to sample
the possible topologies arising from the predicted SSEs. The BCL::Fold
prediction consists of six stages: five assembly stages and one refinement
stage. In each MC step, a randomly chosen perturbation (mutate) is
applied to the current protein model. The assembly and refinement
stages differed in the mutates applied by the MCM algorithm. Whereas
the mutates during the assemble stages apply topology-changing perturbations
like large-scale translations of SSEs or swapping of SSEs, the mutates
during the refinement stage apply only small-scale perturbations like
rotating helices around their main axes. After each application of
a mutate, the resulting protein model is evaluated using a scoring
function, E. Scoring function E is
the weighted sum of various knowledge-based scoring terms Ei and assigns a pseudoenergy
score s to a protein model m by
computing s = E(m) = ∑iwi·Ei(m).14 The scoring terms, Ei, each evaluate different
properties of the protein model such as steric interferences, residue–residue
interactions, SSE–SSE packing, or residue exposure.14 Depending on the score difference between the
current model and last accepted model, a Metropolis criterion either
accepts or rejects the new model.13,14 The Metropolis
criterion in conjunction with simulated annealing is used to prevent
sampling trajectories from getting trapped in local pseudoenergy minima.
Subsequently, the MCM algorithm resumes with the latest accepted model.
The MCM optimization of each assembly and refinement stages lasted
for a maximum of 4000 MC steps with the optimization terminating early
if no improvement in the pseudoenergy score was achieved for 800 MC
steps in a row. In total, this module resulted in 50 000 models.

Upon conclusion of the first topology sampling module, the models
were ranked according to their pseudoenergy score. The best 10% of
the models (∼10 000 models) were selected for clustering
using a k-means implementation in R,25 with the root-mean-square distance
(RMSD) between the backbone Cα-coordinates being
the metric for quantifying the dissimilarity between models (see Procedure S3 for details). The number of clusters
was dynamically adjusted to maximize the average Silhouette width,26,27 which quantifies how tight the grouping of the data points in each
cluster is. Briefly, the Silhouette of a data point n is computed as s(n) = (b(n) – a(n))/max{a(n),b(n)}, where a(n) is the average dissimilarity between n and all other data points in the same cluster and b(n) is the lowest average dissimilarity between n and a data point in any other cluster. The average Silhouette
width of the clustering is computed accordingly as ∑n=1ks(n)/k. The Silhouette width ranges from −1 to 1 with a higher value
indicating a good matching of the data elements to their respective
clusters and poor matching to other clusters, therefore indicating
that clustering represents the underlying data well. For structure
prediction with and without SDSL-EPR data, the clustering resulted
in four and seven clusters, respectively. The cluster medoids and
the most favorable model by the pseudoenergy score were chosen for
another round of optimization using the topology sampling module.
The protocol of this optimization matched the protocol described above
but used the selected models as start models. Upon conclusion of the
second round of optimization, the same clustering protocol was applied
and resulted in three and seven clusters, respectively. The cluster
medoids and the most favorable model by the pseudoenergy score were
selected as start models for the second module, that is, the construction
of loop regions and high-resolution refinement of the models using
Rosetta.

In the second module (see Procedure S4 for details), the Rosetta software suite21,28 was used to construct loop regions, add side-chain coordinates,
and perform a high-resolution refinement of the provided protein models.
The cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm29 was employed for construction of loop regions, and the SDSL-EPR
data was incorporated into CCD and the subsequent refinement using
the motion-on-a-cone (CONE) model30 (see
the following sections for details) following previously published
protocols.20 The weight of the score quantifying
the agreement of the model with the SDSL-EPR data was set to 40 to
ensure that the score accounts for approximately 40% of the total
pseudoenergy score. For each of the provided start models, 500 full-atom
models were sampled using this protocol, resulting in about 20 000
models.

Incorporating SDSL-EPR Data into Computational Protein Structure
Prediction
To use SDSL-EPR spectroscopy for distance measurements
in a protein, a spin label carrying a free electron needs to be introduced
at the two sites of interest. The distance between the two spin-labeling
sites is then determined indirectly by measuring the dipolar interaction
between the two free electrons, which is inversely proportional to
their cubed distance.11,12 The indirect nature of this measurement
poses challenges for using the observed data in a protein structure
prediction algorithm. First, even if the backbone of the protein is
inflexible, the proteins in the sample for the measurement will exhibit
different conformations of the spin label, resulting in a distribution
of distances rather than one observed distance. Second, depending
on the type of spin label and its conformation, the distance between
the free electron and the backbone of the spin-labeled residue can
be rather large, adding uncertainty to the measurement. For example,
for spin label MTSL, the Euclidean distance between the Cβ-atom of the spin-labeled residue and the spin label’s free
electron can be up to 8.5 Å.30

To use the distances measured in the SDSL-EPR experiment within a
protein structure prediction algorithm, a function to quantify the
agreement between the experimental data and a protein model needs
to be defined. This function needs to capture both aforementioned
properties of the SDSL-EPR measurement, the flexibility of the spin
label and the indirectness of the measurement. Previously, different
approaches to define such a function have been published. The motion-on-a-cone
(CONE) model18,30 uses a knowledge-based approach
to account for these factors. This implicit approach provides a rapid
way to estimate the probability of observing a certain Cβ–Cβ distance (DBB) given a measured spin–spin distance (DSL). The agreement score based on the CONE model is defined
on the basis of the difference between DBB and DSL, which can range from −12
to 12 Å. The value of the scoring function ranges from 0.0, which
means no agreement, to −1.0, which means best possible agreement.
This approach has been successfully used for de novo prediction of
membrane proteins18 and soluble proteins
that exist in multiple relevant states.17

Because of its significantly faster computation time, we employed
the CONE model30 to translate the measured
spin–spin distances into structural restraints for the de novo
protein structure prediction algorithm. For the structure prediction
algorithm, the weight of the CONE-based score quantifying the agreement
of the protein model with the SDSL-EPR data was set to 40, which ensured
that this score accounted for about 40% of the total score, a contribution
percentage for limited experimental data that provided the best prediction
results in previous studies.15 Additionally,
we added a quadratic potential function to penalize the models with DSL–DBB values
outside of the range of the CONE model.18

De Novo Prediction Results Confirm the Correctness of the X-ray-Derived
Model
The X-ray crystallography model of the ExoU/SpcU (PDB
entry 3TU3)2 structure is of high quality (resolution = 1.9
Å, Rfree = 0.225, Rwork = 0.191). The C-terminal domain makes few crystal
lattice contacts that are overall unlikely to perturb its confirmation:
V57, L55, and G82 of SpcU appear to form a hydrophobic pocket for
α-helix 23 and SpcU S51 and R83 potentially hydrogen-bond to
ExoU residues N657 and E636, respectively. Otherwise, SpcU does not
appear to influence the structure of the C-terminal four-helix bundle.
Hence, we started with the hypothesis that de novo structure prediction
in conjunction with SDSL-EPR will ultimately be consistent with this
conformation. The de novo prediction of the C-terminal domain of ExoU
resulted in two dissimilar topologies (Figure 2B,C). Whereas one topology is represented
by models exhibiting a structural dissimilarity to the X-ray-derived
model as low as 3.2 Å, the other topology is structurally very
dissimilar with an RMSD100 of about 12 Å relative to the X-ray-derived
model. Notably, both topologies have comparable agreements with the
SDSL-EPR data. The approach described in this study is orthogonal
to the procedures used for obtaining the X-ray-derived model. Although
there is not enough experimental data to rule out either of the two
topologies, the partial convergence of the de novo method on the topology
of the X-ray-derived model reassures its correctness. The topology
that is structurally dissimilar to the X-ray-derived model arrives
at a more favorable pseudoenergy score than the structurally similar
topology (Figure 2B,C).
However, this does not necessarily mean that the alternative topology
is energetically more stable but could also be an artifact caused
by inaccuracies of the free energy approximations. Artifacts like
this have been observed in previous studies and might be eliminated
by obtaining additional distance measurements.17,18

and second (dashed line) iterations of the low-resolution topology

We were also interested in examining
the experimental bimodal distance
distributions observed for A629–A645 and Q649–S672 (see Figure S1 for details). To evaluate the agreement
of the X-ray-derived model of ExoU with the determined distance distributions,
we performed explicit simulation of the distance distribution for
the double mutant A629C–A645C, as described in the Methods section. The double mutant Q649C–S672C
was not evaluated because residue S672 was not resolved in the X-ray-derived
model and modeling the missing coordinates would introduce additional
bias. For double mutant A629–A645, explicit simulation of the
spin labels did not result in a bimodal distribution but in a distinct
peak at around 25.5 Å (Figure S2).
For comparison, EPR spectroscopy determined two peaks: 19.3 ±
1.6 and 24.1 ± 1.9 Å (Figure S1). Taking the accuracy limit of the X-ray-derived model and the fixed
backbone during the explicit simulation into account, we conclude
that the X-ray-derived model is in agreement with the measured mean
distance of 24.1 Å. Additional simulations were performed for
the remaining double mutants that had both spin-labeling sites resolved
in the X-ray-derived model. The simulated peaks matched the experimentally
determined peaks well (Figure S2) given
the accuracy limit of the X-ray-derived model and the fixed backbone
during the simulation. For one double mutant, E636–N657, the
simulation resulted in two peaks: one peak at around 18.5 Å,
which agrees with the experimentally determined peak at 20.0 ±
3.6 Å, and one peak at around 13.5 Å, which would be too
short to detect through the DEER experiment.

Incorporating SDSL-EPR
Data Increases the Probability of Sampling
Accurate Models
De novo sampling of conformations through
an MCM algorithm is a statistical process. The similarity of the sampled
models to the X-ray-derived model corresponds to a normal distribution.
To evaluate if incorporation of SDSL-EPR data increases the probability
of sampling accurate models, the shifts between the distributions
resulting from de novo sampling with and without SDSL-EPR data can
be compared. However, the more important aspect is the accuracy of
the most accurate models alongside the percentage of accurate models.
To quantify improvements in sampling accuracy, we compared the average
RMSD100 values of the 10 most accurate models, μ10, for the two prediction runs. We chose to compare the RMSD100 averages
over 10 models instead of 1 to mitigate the effect of statistical
outliers. Moreover, the percentage of models with an RSDM100 of less
than 5 Å relative to the X-ray-derived model, τ5, was compared. In addition, we also investigated whether incorporation
of SDSL-EPR data results in increased clustering of the sampled models,
as would be expected because the incorporated restraints should exclude
conformations that significantly violate the EPR-derived restraints.

The results of the iterative protocol clearly demonstrate that
incorporation of even a small number of SDSL-EPR distance restraints
significantly increases the probability of sampling accurate models.
Additionally, the most accurate models sampled arrive at an accuracy
not observed for de novo protein structure prediction in the absence
of SDSL-EPR data. This is demonstrated by changes of the μ10 values, which improve from 6.0 to 5.1 Å with the inclusion
of the SDSL-EPR restraints for the first iteration of the low-resolution
topology sampling (Figure 2A and Table 1). The τ5 values for the first iteration were too
low to be compared in a meaningful way. Another notable effect of
incorporating the SDSL-EPR data was an increased clustering of the
sampled models, which is likely caused by the exclusion of models
that are not in agreement with the experimental data. The improved
clustering is demonstrated by improvements of the average Silhouette
width (see the Methods section for details),
which was 0.21 for the first iteration of low-resolution topology
sampling without the SDSL-EPR data and improved to 0.57 when experimental
data was included. Because of improved clustering, a more accurate
set of models could be selected for the second iteration of the low-resolution
topology when including the SDSL-EPR data. This is demonstrated by
more favorable μ10 and τ5 values
after the second iteration, 3.9 Å and 1.2% as compared to 4.9
Å and less than 0.1%, respectively, when no experimental data
was used. This pattern propagated to the high-resolution refinement
step. For prediction with the SDSL-EPR data, the μ10 and τ5 values arrived at 3.2 Å and 0.7%, whereas they were 4.6
Å and less than 0.1% for the prediction without using experimental
data (Table 1).

a Incorporation of
SDSL-EPR data results
in improved sampling accuracy and model discrimination, as shown by
improvements in the average RMSD100 over the 10 most accurate models
sampled (μ10), in the percentage of models with an
RMSD100 less than 5 Å relative to the X-ray-derived model (τ5), and in the enrichment (e).

In conclusion, incorporation of
limited experimental data from
SDSL-EPR spectroscopy into de novo protein structure prediction results
in excluding models that violate the restraints. Although the experimental
data in this test case are too sparse to unambiguously determine the
tertiary structure of the C-terminal domain of ExoU, the probability
of sampling accurate models is significantly improved. This was demonstrated
by improvements of μ10 and τ5 values,
as well as improvements of the average Silhouette width of the clusters,
which indicates an increased clustering of the sampled models.

Incorporation
of the SDSL-EPR Data Improves Discrimination of
Inaccurate Models
Distinguishing between accurate and inaccurate
models resulting from de novo protein structure prediction is typically
hindered by the reduced resolution of the sampled conformations that
result from the relatively coarse-grained approaches used to approximate
a model’s free energy. This was demonstrated by the prediction
results in the absence of SDSL-EPR data. Although moderately accurate
models with an RMSD100 of 4.7 Å relative to the X-ray-derived
model could be sampled during the first iteration of the low-resolution
topology search, the employed scoring function was unable to correctly
distinguish between accurate and inaccurate models, as indicted by
an enrichment value of 0.6 (Table 1). Accurate models were sampled with low probability,
resulting in an accordingly low density. As a consequence, accurate
models could not be detected through clustering. This was demonstrated
by the Silhouette scores that were 0.21 when the SDSL-EPR data were
used and 0.57 otherwise, indicating a broader range of conformations
considered favorable in the absence of SDSL-EPR data. In general,
incorporation of the SDSL-EPR data significantly improved the scoring
function’s ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate
models, which can be shown by comparing the enrichment values that
arrived at 0.6, 0.1, and 0.1 for the two iterations of the low-resolution
topology search and the high-resolution refinement in the absence
of experimental data, respectively, but upon incorporation of the
SDSL-EPR data improved to 2.8, 2.5, and 1.2, respectively (Table 1).

Limitations
in Conformation Sampling and Model Discrimination
Remain
The most accurate full-atom model sampled by the presented
pipeline arrives at an RMSD100 of 3.2 Å (Figure 2 and Table 1) relative to the X-ray-derived model (PDB entry 3TU3), which was reported
at a resolution of 1.9 Å. Therefore, the most accurate model
sampled is not within the accuracy limit of the experimentally determined
reference structure. Assuming that the X-ray-derived model correctly
and accurately represents the protein’s major population in
the equilibrium, the most accurate model does not capture the protein’s
tertiary structure at atomic detail. This may be attributed in part
to necessary simplifications when sampling conformations. Neither
the low-resolution topology sampling nor the high-resolution refinement
exhaustively searches the conformational space, and the most accurate
model sampled could indeed be the most accurate model possible when
using these methods in a de novo approach. For future studies, it
will be worth investigating if this pipeline should be augmented with
molecular dynamics simulations.

Although the discrimination
of inaccurate models could be improved substantially through incorporation
of SDSL-EPR data, as was demonstrated by the improvements of the enrichment
values (Table 1), it
is still not possible to reliably select the most accurate models.
The models with the most favorable score cluster around RMSD100 values
between 7 and 13 Å (Figure 2B). However, the difference in pseudoenergy between
the models with the most favorable pseudoenergy and the models with
the most favorable RMSD100 relative to the X-ray-derived model accounts
for less than 15% of the most favorable score. This indicates that
the discrimination problem could be resolved through additional SDSL-EPR
distance measurements. In this initial study, the C-terminal domain
of ExoU was predicted using only seven EPR-derived restraints, which
in conjunction with the low-resolution translation of experimental
distances into structural restraints is not sufficient to remove ambiguity
from the prediction. Nonetheless, significant improvements were made
even with this modest set of distance measurements, providing a valuable
benchmark for further studies evaluating the impact of a more comprehensive
set of constraints on de novo structure prediction.

Conclusions
Using EPR spectroscopy in conjunction with de novo protein structure
prediction provided an orthogonal approach to probe the structure
of ExoU. The prediction converged on a conformation that is topologically
identical and structurally similar (RMSD100 of 3.2 Å) to the
X-ray-derived model in complex with its chaperone SpcU (PDB entry 3TU3). This result confirms
that the fold of the ExoU C-terminal domain in solution matches the
fold when in complex with its chaperon SpcU. From a different perspective,
we established a protocol to predict a model of a soluble protein
from limited SDSL-EPR data using a combined approach consisting of
BCL::Fold, R, and Rosetta. This approach can be applied to all soluble
proteins.

Methods
In this section, we detail the experimental
methods used to obtain
the SDSL-EPR data and the computational methods to explicitly simulate
EPR-derived distance distributions in silico. This section is concluded
by a description of the quality metrics used to evaluate the protein
structure prediction results.

DEER Spectroscopy and Determination of Distance
Distributions
Four-pulse DEER data were collected on a Bruker
E-580 pulse EPR
spectrometer (Bruker Biospin) operating at Q-band (34 GHz), equipped
with an EN5107D2 resonator and a 10 W microwave amplifier. Selected
MTSL-labeled double-cysteine mutants of ExoU were prepared in 20 mM
3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid, 145 mM NaCl,
pH 7.2, using perdeuterated water and containing 25% (v/v) perdeuterated
glycerol as cryoprotectant. Samples containing a final protein concentration
of approximately 0.1 mM in a volume of 12 μL were flash-frozen
in liquid N2 and immediately placed in the resonator where
sample temperature was maintained at 80 K using an Oxford cryostat.
Data were background-corrected and analyzed by model-free Tikhonov
regularization using DeerAnalysis2011.31

Explicit Simulation of EPR-Derived Distance Distributions
To further evaluate the agreement of the X-ray-derived model with
the SDSL-EPR data, explicit simulation of the spin label distance
distribution was performed for double mutants that had both spin-labeling
sites resolved in the X-ray-derived model. For the explicit simulation,
the endogenous residues at the spin-labeling sites were replaced with
R1A, which is a cysteine residue spin-labeled with MTSL, using Rosetta’s
application for a fixed backbone design, “fixbb”. The
resulting model was subsequently energy-optimized using Rosetta’s
“relax” application. The relaxation was constrained
to the start coordinates to avoid introducing bias through Rosetta’s
scoring function. Constraining to start coordinates limited backbone
perturbations to less than 0.1 Å. Per double mutant, 1000 independent
trajectories were simulated and the spin–spin distances observed
in each trajectory were extracted to determine the spin–spin
distance distribution.

Quantitative Evaluation of the Protein Structure
Prediction
Results
The accuracy of the structure prediction results
was evaluated under two aspects: the sampling accuracy, which is the
structural similarity between the sampled models and the experimentally
determined reference structure, and the discrimination of inaccurate
models, which is how well the employed scoring function could distinguish
between the accurate and inaccurate models. For quantifying the sampling
accuracy, the protein size-normalized RMSD (RMSD100)32 was used, which can be computed as , with RMSD being the RMSD between the Cα-coordinates
of the two structures and l being the number of residues
in the superimposition. To quantify
the model discrimination, the enrichment metric15 was used, which can be computed as . The sets TP and P are both subsets of the set of all sampled models. Set P contains the 10% of the models with the lowest RMSD100
relative to the experimentally determined reference structure. Set TP is computed from sets P and PS, which contains the 10% of the models with the most favorable
pseudoenergy score, as TP = P ∩ PS. Therefore, set TP contains the 10%
most accurate models that are at the same time among the 10% of the
models with the most favorable pseudoenergy score. Accordingly, the
enrichment ranges from 0 to 10 and an enrichment value of 1.0 indicates
that the selection by the employed scoring function is purely random
and discrimination of inaccurate models does not take place. Enrichment
values greater than 1.0 indicate that the scoring function is able
to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate models, whereas enrichment
values less than 1.0 indicate that the scoring function is selecting
against accurate models. An enrichment value of 1.0 indicates that
10% of the most accurate models can be identified by the scoring function.
