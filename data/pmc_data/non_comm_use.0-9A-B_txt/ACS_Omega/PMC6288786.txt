2,2,2-Trichloroethanol
(TCE) is the active form of the sedative
hypnotic drug chloral hydrate, one of the oldest sleep medications
in the market. Understanding of TCE’s action mechanisms to
its many targets, particularly within the ion channel family, could
benefit from the state-of-the-art computational molecular studies.
In this direction, we employed de novo modeling aided by the force
field toolkit to develop CHARMM36-compatible TCE parameters. The classical
potential energy function was calibrated targeting molecular conformations,
local interactions with water molecules, and liquid bulk properties.
Reference data comes from both tabulated thermodynamic properties
and ab initio calculations at the MP2 level. TCE solvation free energy
calculations in water and oil reproduce a lipophilic, yet nonhydrophobic,
behavior. Indeed, the potential mean force profile for TCE partition
through the phospholipid bilayer reveals the sedative’s preference
for the interfacial region. The calculated partition coefficient also
matches experimental measures. Further validation of the proposed
parameters is supported by the model’s ability to recapitulate
quenching experiments demonstrating TCE binding to bovine serum albumin.

Introduction
Chloral hydrate is
a sedative hypnotic drug used for short-term
insomnia treatment. First synthesized in 1832,1 chloral hydrate is the oldest sleep medication in the market. Chloral
hydrate has been widely used as sedative in children undergoing clinical
procedures. Its prescription in pediatrics is recommended for certain
diagnostic procedures such as neurological imaging,2−5 echocardiography,6 and auditory brainstem response testing7 when the patients do not respond to other agents.8

After oral administration, the chloral
hydrate prodrug is rapidly
converted into 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (C2H3Cl3O2). This active metabolite acts at the barbiturate
recognition site on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors,
eliciting sedation.9 Whole-cell patch-clamp
recording has shown that 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) potentiates
GABAA-activated chloride current in mouse hippocampal neurons,10 enhancing synaptic transmission. In addition
to GABAA receptors, electrophysiology essays reported that
TCE can interact with several other molecular targets. For example,
TCE inhibits excitatory N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor and kainate-activated currents in mouse hippocampal neurons
at clinical concentrations, more potently than ethanol.11 Recently, it has also been shown that TCE modulates
the recombinant human two-pore-domain potassium channels TREK-1 and
TRAAK in a reversible, concentration-dependent manner.12 Furthermore, tryptophan fluorescence quenching
experiments demonstrated that TCE binds to bovine (BSA) and human
(HSA) serum albumin plasma proteins.13

Despite the fact that TCE potentiates a range of protein receptors,
its action mechanisms at the microscopic level are not clear. In the
context of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, understanding how
TCE modulates these proteins requires an accurate atomistic model
for both receptor and ligand. Although high-resolution crystallographic
structures for some of these targets are available in the Protein
Data Bank, an all-atom TCE model is still missing. We therefore present
TCE parameters compatible with the CHARMM additive force field for
biomolecules, useful for MD simulations.14 The model is based on target quantities including molecular conformations,
bulk phase properties, partition coefficient in water and oil, and
TCE’s binding affinity to BSA.

Results and Discussion
TCE Parameters
TCE presents two main conformers, trans
and gauche (Figure 1), with electronic properties calculated at the MP2 level shown in Table 1. The magnitude of
the trans conformation dipole moment |μ⃗| differs significantly
from that of the gauche one (3.2 D against 1.6 D, respectively). Despite
that, the isotropic portion of the polarizability tensor α̅
(au) shows almost the same magnitude for both geometries (53.0 and
52.1 au, respectively), with all individual components being very
similar. The values for nondiagonal components suggest that both TCE
conformers display an isotropic polarizable character. Gauche is the
most stable at the MP2 level; the energy difference between geometries
is 3.22 kcal/mol. All-atom parameters were thus calibrated by taking
the gauche conformer as the molecular target.

The dipole moment of TCE at the quantum mechanical
(QM) level is
overestimated by 43% in the mechanical molecular (MM) model, preserving
vector orientation.14 MM parameters for
bond and valence angles reproduce QM geometry within an acceptable
margin of error with deviations up to 0.03 Å and 3°, respectively.14 TCE intramolecular interactions also agree with
same data obtained from large-angle X-ray scattering experiments.16 Torsional angles Cl–C2–C1–O
and H–O–C1–C2 are used as conformational descriptors,
the latter distinguishing trans and gauche conformers. As shown in Figure 2, their MM potential
energy surfaces (PESs) fit QM data within 0.125 kcal/mol, comparable
to kBT. Parameters and
associated errors for partial charges and Lennard-Jones (LJ) and bond
parameters are presented as Supporting Information Tables S1–S3. Note that Lennard-Jones parameters used
to treat van der Waals interactions of TCE were assigned by transferability
of similar chemical types available at the CHARMM force field (cf. Computational Methods).

from fully relaxed torsional scans at the MP2 level (solid lines)
and empirical model (dashed lines). Note the two local minima for
H–O–C1–C2 torsional angle at −70 and +70°,
both gauche conformers.

Pure Solvent Properties
As shown in Table 2, calculated density and enthalpy
of vaporization of TCE agree with experimental reference values, reproducing
physicochemical properties of the bulk phase. Radial pair distribution
functions (RDFs) as computed from pure solvent MD simulations of TCE
show well-resolved peaks at 1.79, 2.72, 2.92, 3.12, and 3.94 Å,
respectively, assigned to bond (−) and nonbonded (···)
interactions C2–Cl1, C1···Cl1, Cl1···Cl3, O1···Cl1, and O1···Cl3 (Figure 3).
A hydrogen bond between O1 and O1 is also resolved
at 2.92 Å. All peaks coincide with the reference RDF description
for pure TCE, indicating that intra- and intermolecular interactions
are correctly reproduced at the atomic level.16 Note that simulation of TCE is predominantly populated by the gauche
conformer with an occupancy probability of 78%, as expected from its
larger stability. The gauche conformer thus accounts for most of the
nonbonded interactions resolved in RDF analysis.

Solvation Properties
TCE’s solvation free energy
into hexane (oil) was calculated via free energy perturbation (FEP)
and amounts to ΔGoil = −4.60
± 0.001 kcal/mol, in agreement with TCE’s expected apolar
character.17 In spite of its favorable
interaction with the apolar medium, TCE’s solvation free energy
in water is within the same range as that in oil (ΔGwater = −4.83 ± 0.001 kcal/mol), suggesting
that TCE is a lipophilic yet nonhydrophobic molecule. Figure 3 displays RDF profiles and
solvation free energy for TCE in both water and oil (hexane).

Transfer
of TCE Across Membrane
To characterize TCE’s
partition into the membrane, adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations
were employed to compute the potential of mean force (PMF) of a single
TCE crossing a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) bilayer in the transmembrane z direction (Figure 4). Analysis of PMF
evidences a clear energy minimum at the phospholipids’ headgroup–tail
interface region, with a stabilization of ΔGPOPC° =
−4.32 ± 0.690 kcal/mol relative to bulk. TCE behavior
accompanies the trend of some anesthetics such as isoflurane and sevoflurane,
which show a distinct preference for the membrane interface.20 For comparison, Figure 4 also shows sevoflurane PMF, calculated under
the same conditions as for TCE (anesthetic parameters come from Barber
et al.21). PMF-derived atomic density for
TCE is depicted in Figure 4c.

Figure 4 Transfer of TCE across membrane. (a) TCE–membrane system

(ii), and water (iii) are indicated. (b) Potential of mean force (PMF)
of TCE along the transmembrane direction. Accumulated statistical
error for the PMF was estimated following eq 3 (cf. Computational Methods) and amounts to 0.69 kcal/mol, indicating convergence of calculations.
Sevoflurane PMF is shown for comparison. (c) Atomic density of TCE

headgroups. The first peak at 1.5 Å configures a typical hydrogen
bond. The inset shows the molecular view of TCE binding to membrane
headgroups via hydrogen bonds. Molecular images were rendered using
VMD.19

It is worth noting that TCE is a halogenated molecule containing
a hydroxyl group that can act as a hydrogen bond donor. Indeed, TCE–membrane
headgroup RDF indicates a first peak at about 1.5 Å, configuring
a typical hydrogen bond between the ligand and the lipid (Figure 4e). The hydroxyl
group observed in TCE is absent in the general anesthetic sevoflurane,
thus rationalizing their differential stabilization within the membrane
core. Although the former displays modest stabilization (less than
1 kcal/mol) in water, the energy difference in the latter favors membrane
core by approximately 3 kcal/mol.

The PMF of TCE was integrated
to estimate its POPC–water
partition coefficient (log K), eq 4. The calculated and tabulated theoreticala values, respectively, log K = 1.69 ± 0.001 and 0.97 ± 0.389 at 298.15 K, are within
the same order of magnitude, supporting model’s ability to
reproduce ligand’s lipid solubility properties.

Dissociation
Constants for BSA Sites
TCE is known to
interact and bind to both human and bovine serum albumin (HSA and
BSA, respectively). To further validate the proposed TCE parameters,
model’s affinity to these binding partners are confronted with
ones determined from fluorescence quenching experiments.13

Briefly, in the experiment, BSA tryptophan
residues W134 and W213 were effectively
quenched by TCE at pH 7.0, allowing to pin down an apparent TCE dissociation
constant of KD = 3.3 ± 0.3 mmol/L.
HSA contains a single tryptophan residue,
namely, W214, which is analogous to BSA’s W213. Thus, a combination of HSA and BSA quenching experiments
meant individual dissociation constants of TCE from sites in the vicinity
of BSA’s W134 and W213 could
be estimated, respectively, as KD = 2.1
± 0.1 and 12.0 mmol/L.13

Because
quenching of W134 and W213 suggests
two BSA binding sites for TCE, here labeled as s1 and
s2, molecular docking and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations were performed with the aim at
reproducing experimental data (cf. Computational
Methods) (Figure 5). All measures (calculated and experimental)
are reported in Table 3. The progression of free energy changes as a function of λ
parameter for BSA binding sites during the course of five successive
coupling/decoupling simulations is shown in Figure 6. Curves are well-behaved, which indicates
that the time scale was small enough to correlate multiple homologous
windows. As shown in Table 3, our predicted dissociation constants for ligand binding
at sites s1 and s2 are in the same order of magnitude as that of the experimental estimates.
Besides, the predicted constants also agree qualitatively with measurements
as the experimentally determined higher affinity of TCE to site s1
is recapitulated in the calculations.

Sites s1 and s2 are both
buried in the protein and partially accessible
to solvent. Independent MD simulations of the protein with bound ligands
at sites s1 and s2 show that TCE remains confined to the binding sites,
hydrated by few water molecules and in close contact with protein
amino acids including W134 and W213 (Figure 7). Despite
these structural similarities, TCE binds site s1 with a higher affinity.
Given TCE’s favorable interactions with lipids (Figure 4), the predominant
hydrophobic nature of site s1, as highlighted in Figure 5, makes sense of the result.

s1 and s2. Per-site amino acid contacts (a) and number of water molecules

equilibrium MD simulations (30 ns) of the ligand–protein bound
state.

According to eq 7,
we also calculated the standard binding free energy corresponding
to both simultaneously bounded states s1 and s2 (unique saturation):
ΔGs1,s2° = −5.45 kcal/mol. This value,
comparable to the standard binding free energy for POPC (ΔGPOPC° = −4.32 ± 0.69 kcal/mol), evidences TCE’s greater
affinity for the receptor rather than for the membrane. By these results,
TCE is expected to bind protein targets with higher affinities, opening
the possibility that it may bind ion channels when partitioning the
membrane.

Conclusions
A fine atomistic CHARMM36-compatible
model for TCE, a sedative
hypnotic drug, is presented in this article. Model development targets
gas-phase conformations and molecular electrostatic potential with
individual TIP3P water molecules via weak hydrogen bonding. Validation
is ensured, as developed parameters appropriately reproduce ligand’s
physical and chemical properties, including liquid bulk properties,
lipid partitioning, and interaction to protein targets.

Overall,
our results support that the presented TCE force-field
parameters are robust and likely to be useful in a large series of
in silico biological studies. TCE is known experimentally to interact
favorably with albumin and phospholipids as judged respectively from
its dissociation constant and water–oil partition coefficient. Figures 4 and 5 not only make sense of these experimental facts but also
provide a detailed molecular model for ligand interaction to these
substrates. Such a model is particularly useful to interpret and design
novel experiments for characterization of ligand binding to membrane
and albumin with potential consequences for our understanding of TCE
action in membrane-embedded proteins. In this regard, our contribution
opens the possibility to explore novel problems regarding the interaction
of small ligands and ion channels, a field of immense interest.22 Particular attention might be driven to K2P
channels as the scientific literature still lacks information about
their modulation mechanism by TCE and related molecules.

Computational
Methods
Parametrization Adjustment
The MATCH atom-typing toolset
was used to set initial atom parameters for TCE.23 The optimization protocol proceeded in stages: acquisition
of quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular mechanics (MM) data, comparison
of conformational properties, and refinements. Distributed as a VMD
plugin,19 the force field toolkit20 contains helpful scoring algorithms to fit MM
to QM data24 that allowed determination
of accurate TCE parameters. In detail, the TCE equilibrium geometry
at the QM level was defined as the molecular target. Next, atomic
charge distributions were determined on the basis of QM interactions
with individual TIP3P water molecules. For each donor or acceptor
hydrogen bond, a typical linear geometry was built and then bond distances
were optimized keeping fixed all other degrees of freedom. Ligand–water
interaction energies were scaled by a factor of 1.16, whereas hydrogen
bond lengths were shifted by an offset of −0.2 Å to yield
appropriate bulk phase parameters.25,26 QM partial
atomic charges for the equilibrium geometry were used as a trial set
for the charge optimization procedure. The objective function was
then optimized on the basis of these QM interaction energies for TCE–water
complexes until convergence was reached. During this iterative process,
the QM dipole was allowed to be overestimated by 20–50% to
reach consistency with the bulk phase.27

Bond and valence angle parameters were optimized by computing
the energetic perturbation of small distortions from the equilibrium
QM geometry along redundant internal coordinates. Optimization proceeded
until convergence of bond and angle objective functions. Torsional
parameters were obtained by fitting QM potential energy surfaces (PESs)
for TCE dihedrals Cl–C2–C1–O and H–O–C1–C2.
Torsion scans at the QM level were conducted by rotating dihedrals
from −180 to +180° with a step size of 5°, providing
an energy function in the form 1  

where Vk is the fitted
barrier height (force constant), and k and δk are dihedral multiplicity and phase, respectively.
Parameters were adjusted to fit QM PES until convergence of the root-mean-square
deviation. Finally, Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters used to treat van
der Waals interactions were assigned by transferability of similar
chemical types available at the CHARMM general force field (CGenFF).
After running a full optimization cycle, the geometry was minimized
via a 1000-step gradient to compare the developed model to the QM
target. As a standard practice, TCE–water interactions were
reoptimized using this MM geometry, whereas Hessian and PES remained
unmodified and a new round of parametrization was performed to ensure
self-consistency. Further rounds were not required because no significant
improvement was obtained. All MM calculations were performed using
NAMD 2.10.28

QM Calculations
Molecular geometry was optimized at
the MP2/6-31G(d) level, and initial partial atomic charges were derived
from MP2/6-31G(d) Merz–Kollman charges.29 Water interaction profiles were optimized at the HF/6-31G(d)
level. Although higher levels of QM theory may lead to more accurate
geometries and hydrogen bond energies, the chosen level of theory
for water interaction profiles maintains consistency with the CHARMM
additive force field.14,27 The QM Hessian matrix and the
relaxed PES were also calculated at the MP2/6-31G(d) level. Constraints
were imposed to the scanned dihedrals during molecule minimization.
All electronic structure calculations were performed in Gaussian 09.15

MD Simulations
Condensed phase simulations
were performed
in an NPT ensemble at 298.15 K and 1 bar using Langevin dynamics and
the Langevin piston algorithm as implemented in NAMD 2.10.28 Periodic boundary conditions were applied to
all MD simulations. The particle mesh Ewald method was employed to
evaluate full electrostatics using a real-space grid spacing of 1.2
Å or less. The multiple-time-step r-RESPA integrator was used,
with a base time step of 2 fs for short-range nonbonded forces and
extended time of 4 fs for soft, long-range interactions. Pairwise
nonbonded interactions were truncated at a distance of 12 Å with
a smooth switching function above (10 Å).

Pure Solvent Properties
The starting configuration
for liquid phase simulations consisted of 216 TCE molecules placed
with random orientation at the grid points of a cubic lattice (6.5
× 6.5 × 6.5 Å3). A 10 000-step minimization
followed by gradual heating during 10 ps was applied to the whole
system for equilibration. Equilibrium data was collected for 0.4 ns
to compute the average periodic cell volume to estimate TCE density.

Under the ideal-gas assumption and negligible mechanical work in
the liquid phase,14 the enthalpy of vaporization
at a given temperature T can be written as 2  where  and ⟨Ugas⟩ correspond, respectively, to the average potential
energy
of the molecule in liquid and gas phases. First,  was estimated on the
basis of the liquid
phase simulation of N = 216 molecules of TCE. Then,
each molecule’s final configuration in the liquid phase was
isolated and subsequently simulated in gas phase. These individual
simulations comprised 50 ps of equilibration with a friction coefficient
of 5 ps–1 followed by 50 ps of data collection.
Finally, ⟨Ugas⟩ was obtained
by averaging over the potential energy relative to N = 216 configurations.

Solvation Properties
TCE solvation
free energies in
bulk water and oil phase were evaluated using TIP3P water and hexane
molecules, respectively.30 Both solvent
models are available in CHARMM36. Solvation free energies were computed
via free energy perturbation calculations (FEP).31 In these alchemical transformations, the solute is decoupled
from the environment by turning its intermolecular interactions off,
using a scalar parameter λ. A soft-core potential was adopted
to scale the nonbonded pair potential of the perturbed system according
to a dual coupling parameter (van der Waals and electrostatics).32 Alchemical transformations were split into 100
“windows” and carried out explicitly in both directions,
i.e., decoupling (integration over λ from 0 to 1) and recoupling
simulations (integration over λ from 1 to 0). Each window contains
4 ps of relaxation followed by 66 ps of data collection. The soft-core
potential shift distance was set to 7.0 Å2 for water
and 5.5 Å2 for hexane, after several optimizations
by trial and error. In total, five independent simulations (replicas)
were performed with different initial velocities and seeds for the
stochastic term in the Langevin thermostat. Statistical errors related
to solvation free energies were computed with the simple overlap sampling
(SOS) algorithm.18

Partitioning to Lipid Bilayer
A TCE molecule was inserted
in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) bilayer model, available in CHARMM36. A lamella with dimensions
of approximately 45.0 × 43.0 × 89.0 Å3 was
built using 59 lipids. The POPC bilayer was hydrated by 3171 TIP3P
water molecules. Free energy profile or potential of mean force (PMF)
for TCE to cross the membrane was computed using the adaptive biasing
force algorithm (ABF) as implemented in NAMD.33,34 In the method, the reaction coordinate to be sampled ξ is
discretized in i bins. PMF is then derived from a
biasing force added to the system’s equations of motion to
counteract average forces acting on each bin. Here, the reaction coordinate
ξ, with bin size 0.1 Å, and defined as the distance z between TCE and the center of POPC lamella, was sampled
over 300 ns simulation. The accumulated statistical error throughout
the PMF was calculated according to the equation35 3  where ia and ib are bin
indices delimiting the ξ-interval [a, b]; Δt is the simulation time step;
and, for each bin, ni, τi, and ⟨ΔFξ2⟩, respectively, stand
for the number of samples accrued, autocorrelation time, and variance
of the instantaneous force Fξ.

The partition coefficient K was computed from the
PMF following equation36 4  where |a – b| is the system width from bulk to the
membrane center,
along z. Partition coefficient statistical uncertainty
was estimated by propagating the average bin error Err[ΔGa→b]/i.

Binding Affinity to BSA
Fluorescence
quenching experiments
suggest that TCE binds to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at two distinct
sites, namely, in the vicinity of tryptophans 134 and 213.13 To further characterize and validate the TCE
model, molecular docking and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations
of TCE against BSA were performed and compared with experimental data.

AutoDock Vina software was used to dock the ligand into an ensemble
of BSA equilibrium structures to allow for sampling of the protein’s
configurational space.37 Binding sites
were delimited from the ensemble of docking poses in such a way that
each binding site was defined as the effective volume outlined by
protein residues with the largest number of contacts to docking poses.
In this manner, site s1 is defined by residues L197, W213, S343, L346, S453, L480, and V481 and
site s2 by residues K20, V40, K131, W134, and G135 (Figure 5). Although docking
was performed in vacuum, subsequent equilibrium and FEP simulations
were conducted in the presence of explicit all-atom water molecules,
thus taking environmental effects into account. Specifically, the
simulated system comprised the protein receptor (BSA) embedded in
a homogeneous reservoir, with diluted ligand (TCE) concentration.
The protein is assumed to be in a well-defined conformational state
in which it provides two distinct TCE binding sites, s1 and s2. Hence,
the equilibrium constant for the process of bringing the ligand from
the bulk into the bound state (s1, s2) can be solved by means of an
MD/FEP approach.38 The method requires
a harmonic potential coupled to the ligand 5  to guarantee that it is restrained to occupy
the effective volume centered at the receptor binding site R*; the restraint k exerts no force when the ligand
center of mass is within a distance R from the equilibrium
position and exerts a harmonic restoring force when the ligand center
of mass is out of this range. In our case, force constants were estimated
from the root-mean-square fluctuation of docking solutions. The equilibrium
binding constant for each individual site j, j ∈ (s1, s2), can be written as 6  By definition, Wj*(R) is the reversible
work to transfer a single ligand
from the gas phase to the respective bound state and μ̅
refers to its solvation free energy. Thereon, assuming that the binding
sites are independent, an aggregate affinity constant, for both binding
sites to be simultaneously occupied by a single ligand each, can be
defined as the product of the individual constants38 7  From eq 6, the standard binding free energy relative to bringing a
single ligand from a reference standard reservoir concentration into
the respective target site j can be defined as 8  where C° =
1 M or in
units of number density C° = (1660 Å3)−1. Finally, from eq 7, we can derive the standard binding free
energy relative to bringing two indistinguishable ligands from a reference
standard reservoir concentration into simultaneously occupied binding
sites s1 and s2 9  To compute binding affinities described above,
alchemical transformations were conducted by decoupling and recoupling
the TCE gauche conformer from each BSA binding site separately. Starting
from protein–TCE equilibrated systems as resolved from docking,
decoupling/recoupling was carried out by varying the λ coupling
parameter in steps of 0.01, amounting to 100 windows per transformation.
Transformations in each direction spanned 2 ps of relaxation followed
by 6.4 ns of data collection, thus totaling 12.8 ns of collection
per replica, per site. For the purpose of improving statistics, site-specific
FEP estimates and the associated statistical errors were determined
from five independent decoupling/recoupling runs. Restraints on the
ligand’s center of the mass were included in the calculations
to ensure appropriate sampling within the binding site so that TCE’s
chemical potential remains well defined during the final decoupling
or initial recoupling stages.39,40
