Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides
are characterized as the major
factors associated with neuron death in Alzheimer’s disease,
which is listed as the most common form of neurodegeneration. Disordered
Aβ peptides are released from proteolysis of the amyloid precursor
protein. The Aβ self-assembly process roughly takes place via
five steps: disordered forms → oligomers → photofibrils
→ mature fibrils → plaques. Although Aβ fibrils
are often observed in patient brains, oligomers were recently indicated
to be major neurotoxic elements. In this work, the neurotoxic compound
S-shape Aβ11–42 tetramer (S4Aβ11–42) was investigated over 10 μs of unbiased MD simulations. In
particular, the S4Aβ11–42 oligomer adopted
a high dynamics structure, resulting in unsuccessful determination
of their structures in experiments. The C-terminal was suggested as
the possible nucleation of the Aβ42 aggregation.
The sequences 27–35 and 39–40 formed rich β-content,
whereas other residues mostly adopted coil structures. The mean value
of the β-content over the equilibrium interval is ∼42
± 3%. Furthermore, the dissociation free energy of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide was predicted using a biased sampling
method. The obtained free energy is ΔGUS = −58.44 kcal/mol which is roughly the same level
as the corresponding value of the U-shape Aβ17-42 peptide. We anticipate that the obtained S4Aβ11–42 structures could be used as targets for AD inhibitor screening over
the in silico study.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is known as common dementia, affecting
more than 40 million people worldwide.1 AD patients lose cognition and memory slowly for more than 20 years
before the symptoms are clarified.2,3 Among several
hypotheses which have been proposed to explain the mechanism of AD,
the amyloid cascade hypothesis emerges as one of the most probable
ones. In particular, AD is associated with the aspect of Amyloid beta
(Aβ) oligomers.4,5 Thus, understanding the structure
of Aβ oligomers at the atomic level might enhance AD therapy.6,7 Unfortunately, it is very hard to identify structural details of
oligomers in experiments because they exist transiently.8 Computational investigations thus emerged as
a highly appropriate method to resolve these problems.9,10

Missing knowledge of the stable structures of Aβ oligomers
has hindered their functional studies,11,12 resulting
in unsuccessful designing of inhibitors for Aβ oligomers to
date. In the case of distinguished Aβ oligomers, it is popularly
argued that the β-strand content is related to neurotoxicity.13 Promising inhibitors for the Aβ oligomerization
mostly focus on preventing the β-structure.14,15 Although these compounds are able to inhibit Aβ oligomerization
in both experimental and computational studies,16 the number of available drugs is negligible unfortunately.17 Moreover, some compounds, which are able to
enhance the self-assembly rate of Aβ peptides, have also been
used as potential inhibitors.18,19 If the lag phase time
of Aβ oligomerization is decreased, the oligomeric period would
thus be reduced. However, efficient compounds are still obstacles
despite much effort over recent years.5,19

It is
known that the self-aggregation of Aβ peptides strongly
rely upon their sequences and fragment sizes.20,21 Mutations are able to change the structure and kinetics of Aβ
oligomers such as A2T,22 A2V,22 D7N,23 F19W,24 A21G,25 E22G,26 E22Q,27,28 E22K,26 and D23N29,30 mutations. The familial mutations
attract several investigations due to their influence on AD patients.
Moreover, the chain length absolutely alters the self-assembly rate
and kinetics of Aβ peptides. The fibrillation time of the more
common Aβ40 peptide is significantly larger than
that of the Aβ42 peptide,31 although there are two residue differences only.6 However, it is very hard to characterize the structural
information of Aβ42 oligomers in solution,8,32 because the more toxic Aβ42 oligomers are more
unstable than the Aβ40 ones.32 Furthermore, the lag phase of the Aβ peptide also depends
on the order/weight of the oligomer.21,33 The higher-order
oligomer requires a larger self-aggregation time.33

In addition, due to the fact that Aβ trimers
and tetramers
are the highest cytotoxicity forms of low-weight oligomers,34 many investigations were implemented to understand
the structural information of Aβ trimers.30,35−38 However, detailed information of Aβ tetramers is still limited,
especially the structural details of Aβ42 tetramers
because these oligomers are highly dynamic compounds.32 Despite efforts to mimic the formation of the solvated
Aβ1-42 tetramer starting from Aβ1-42 monomers using discrete MD simulations,39 the β-content of the obtained Aβ1-42 tetramer (<18%) was found to be significantly
lower than the experimental observations.40 Moreover, the Aβ1-42 tetramer with the appropriate
amount of β-content (34 ± 5%) was also formed from 4 Aβ1-42 monomers using MD simulations,41 but it is hard to explain the elongation of Aβ photofibrils
based on the morphology of the obtained Aβ1-42 tetramer, which is considered as subunits constructing the fibrils.31,42−44 Therefore, an investigation for the formation of
the Aβ tetramer emerges as an urgent task, in which the obtained
structures would satisfy critical conditions such as adopting appropriate
oligomeric size, suitable secondary structures, and the ability to
be used as subunits for elongating photofibrils.

In this work,
we have simulated Aβ11–42 tetramer starting
from the fibril-like S-shape structure (S4Aβ11–42) over 10 μs of MD simulations to understand
the structural change of this compound in solution. The representative
shapes of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide are obtained
using a combination of the collective-variable free energy landscape
(FEL) and clustering methods according to previous works.30,45 The secondary structure change of the peptide was monitored every
10 ps employing the dictionary of protein secondary structure (DSSP)
protocol.46 The oligomer size fluctuation
was observed over the radius of gyration, collision cross section
(CCS), and solvent surface accessible area (SASA) calculations. The
obtained results would enhance the understanding of the Aβ self-aggregation.

Results
and Discussion
Selected Initial Conformation of the Aβ
Tetramer
Aβ oligomers are probable establishing blocks
for generating
photofibrils and/or mature fibrils.10,47 It may be
argued that the shapes of Aβ oligomers might be collected from
the simulations, whereas the initial structures are able to be a random
coil39,41 or a fibril-like structure.10,48 There is a prohibition of CPU time consumption for simulating the
disordered protein which is started from a random structure initially.10 Moreover, although the disordered domain with
a sequence of 1–10 was found to be able to alter the self-aggregation
of Aβ oligomers,22,23 these effects are insignificant
in comparison with those of the hydrophobic domains. The sequence
has frequently not been included in previous studies.49−52 Inconsideration of the disordered domain also provides the advantage
that the CPU time consumption would reduce.30 Furthermore, the Aβ peptides normally adopt monomorphic,52 two-fold,53,54 and three-fold structures.55 However, the computational study of the two-fold
and three-fold shapes would be much more time consuming because of
extremely increasing the degree of freedom in comparison with the
monomorphic system. Therefore, a fibril-like structure of the Aβ11–42 peptide with a monomorphic conformation would
be selected as the initial structure of a long time scale MD simulation,
which is known to be able to appropriately sample the conformation
of the Aβ peptide.56 Here, the S-shape
model52 was chosen as the investigated
model instead of the U-shape model.57 The
initial shape of S-shape Aβ11–42 is shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Initial conformation

which was extracted from the S-shape Aβ11–42 fibril with PDB ID 2MXU.52 The blue spheres were employed to
note the N-terminus.

All-Atom Molecular Dynamics Simulation
A long time
conventional MD simulation would provide details of both dynamics
and kinetics of the Aβ self-aggregation process. During the
simulations, the tetramer significantly adopts the structural changes
over the first 4 μs of MD simulation until reaching a stable
point (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). The convergence of simulations was guaranteed according the superposition
of the calculated metrics over various simulation time intervals (Figure S2). The structural analyses were thus
performed over the time interval 4–10 μs of MD simulations.
During the equilibrium interval, the Cα atomic fluctuations (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information file) indicated that the sequences 15–20
and 24–37 are rigidly stable during simulation with a Cα RMSF of approximately 0.14 nm, while
sequences 11–14, 21–23, and 38–42 change with
a Cα RMSF ranging from 0.20 to 0.5
nm. The obtained results are in good agreement with the secondary
structure analysis in the next subsection. The C-terminal is more
important than the N-terminal stabilizing the S4Aβ11–42 oligomer. It implies that the C-terminal enables possible nucleation
of the S4Aβ11–42 self-assembly instead of
the N-terminal, which controls the aggregation of the 3Aβ11-40 peptide.10 Furthermore,
it may be argued that available inhibitors for the Aβ40 peptide would have less effect on the Aβ42 peptides
because these compounds favorably bind to the N-terminal.30

In addition, the dynamics of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide was a probable interpretation through
monitoring the system size and intermolecular interactions between
the constituting chains (Figure 2). The obtained size of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide is appropriate when compared with other oligomers. In particular,
the radius of gyration (Rg) of the S4Aβ11–42 system was computed with a mean value of 1.46
± 0.03 nm, which is significantly smaller than that of the 4Aβ1-42 peptide in solution (∼1.6 ± 1 nm).41 The smaller Rg of
the S4Aβ11–42 peptide is probably caused by
the shorter of the sequence. However, interestingly, the Rg value of S4Aβ11–42 is slightly
smaller than that of D23N 3Aβ11-40 (∼1.49
± 0.05 nm),30 although the trimeric
system has inevitably fewer number of residues. Moreover, the Rg value of S4Aβ11–42 spreads out in the larger range (from 1.38 to 1.78 nm) in comparison
with the D23N 3Aβ11-40 oligomer (from 1.28
to 1.64 nm). The results imply that the S4Aβ11–42 peptide is more flexible than the D23N 3Aβ11-40 peptide. On the other hand, the size of the oligomer is also described
through the CCS and SASA values. These amounts propagate in the large
ranges of 14.80–17.60 nm2 and 68.50–87.50
nm2, respectively. The corresponding mean values are 16.06
± 0.32 nm2 and 77.23 ± 2.26 nm2, respectively.
The CCS value of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide is
smaller than that of the helical transmembrane Aβ11–42 tetramer (4tmαAβ11–42), which was measured to be 17.64 ± 0.97 nm2.58 Moreover, both CCS and SASA values are significantly
larger than that of Aβ11-40 trimers (3Aβ11-40),10,24,30 although these radii of gyration were approximately equaled. In
addition, the number of intermolecular sidechain contact (SC) between
constituting chains of the S4Aβ11–42 oligomer
during the last 6 μs of MD simulations was counted as 54.98
± 1.91 that metric was recorded in the range from 46.50 to 63.00.
Overall, the high fluctuations of Rg,
CCS, SASA, and number of SC implied the high dynamics of the S4Aβ11–42 system according to the previous observation.32

Collected metrics were obtained over interval 4–10 μs
of MD simulations.

Secondary Structure of
the S4Aβ11–42
Secondary structures
are important metrics characterizing
physical and structural properties of Aβ systems. Normally,
the β-content of Aβ peptides is supposedly related to
the neurotoxicity of the oligomers because the value is characterizing
the self-assembly of Aβ peptides.32 The secondary structure changes were monitored employing the DSSP
protocol over the time interval 4–10 μs of MD simulations.46 The obtained distributions of the secondary
structure values are mentioned in Figure 3. In particular, the β-content of the
S4Aβ11–42 peptide spreads out in the range
of 24–55% with an average value of 42 ± 3%. The coil content
fluctuates in the range of 37–70% with a mean amount of 51
± 3%. The α-content is the smallest amount in comparison
with the other secondary structure terms with the average amount of
3 ± 2%. The turn content is approximately measured as 5 ±
2%.

Figure 3 Distributions of secondary structure terms of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide over the last 6 μs of MD simulations.

The secondary structure terms
per residues of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide were
averaged over 600 000 MD snapshots
and are presented in Figure 4. The S4Aβ11–42 system adopts a rigid
β-content in the C-terminal (especially in the sequences 27–35
and 39–40). Other residues mostly form the coil structure implying
that the S4Aβ11–42 peptide is highly flexible,
which is in good concurrence with the previous experiment.32 Secondary structure allocation is in good agreement
with the previous studies of the Aβ1-42 monomer,
dimer, and pentamer.59−61 On the other hand, the S4Aβ11–42 peptide plays a different role in comparison to the 3Aβ11-40 oligomer, which forms a richer β-content
in the N-terminal.10 Especially, the hydrophobic
domain of the N-terminal (sequence 17–21) of the S4Aβ11–42 oligomer forms less than 50% of the β-content
for each residue in comparison with the corresponding value ∼90%
of the U-shape 3Aβ11-40 peptide.30 It may be argued that the C-terminal acts as
the possible nucleation of Aβ42 fibrils instead of
the N-terminal does in the Aβ40 peptide.10

Representative Structures
of the S4Aβ11–42 Peptides
A combination
of the FEL and clustering methods
was employed to find the appropriately representative conformations
of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide.45 As mentioned below, the collective variable FEL was constructed
using the backbone root-mean square deviation (rmsd) and intermolecular
SC as the two reaction coordinates. The S4Aβ11–42 FEL is shown in Figure 5. Three minima were observed which correspond to the coordinates
(rmsd; number of SC) of three minima which are (0.86; 54.75), (0.77;
56.00), and (0.73; 57.50), respectively. A clustering method with
a backbone cut-off 0.2 nm was then applied to the refined snapshots,
which was detected in the free-energy minima, to achieve the representative
shapes of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide. The collected
conformations are noted as A, B, and C as displayed in Figure 5. In particular, these shapes were observed at the
corresponding times as follow 8997.87, 4720.38, and 6008.80 ns, respectively.
Furthermore, the corresponding shapes occupied 56, 7, and 8% of total
conformations over the time interval 4–10 μs of MD simulations.
Structural information of these shapes is described in Table 1. The CCS of the three shapes
is ∼15.88 nm2, which is slightly smaller than that
of the helical transmembrane Aβ17-42 tetramer
(4tmαAβ11–42) with
a value of ∼16.5 nm2.58 The α-content was observed in both shapes B and C, whereas the structure was not detected in the representative
conformation A (Figure 5). Moreover, it is known that the self-assembly of
the Aβ peptide is supposed to be random coil structure →
α-structure → β-structure.12,62 It probably can be argued that the similar α-structure accommodating
but richer coil content shape B is an intermediate structure
of the self-assembly process from a random structure to the shape C. Similarly, the shape C is a transitional structure
of the self-aggregation process from the α-structure containing
the B shape to the metastable shape A. In
other words, the self-assembly pathway would probably be as follows
shape B → shape C → shape A (Figure S4 of Supporting Information file). This argument is consistent with the obtained free energy
barrier of these conformations (Figure 5).

contacts between the constituting chains of the peptide are used as

Dissociation Free Energy of the S4Aβ11-40 Oligomer
As mentioned above, the Aβ
peptides consisting
of three/four monomers are hallmarked as the most toxic compounds
among low weight oligomers.34 The self-aggregation
process from a trimer to a tetramer could be deduced through studying
the dissociation free energy of the monomer located at the edge of
the Aβ tetramer. The understanding of Aβ self-assembly
would be further illuminated. Several approaches were developed to
determine the binding affinity between the two molecules.63−67 Here, the umbrella sampling (US) method was employed to estimate
the disassociation energy barrier referring to a previous study.68 The free energy ΔG over
US simulations along reaction coordinate ξ was determined employing
the weight histogram analysis method (WHAM).69 In particular, the most representative conformation A was chosen to evaluate the dissociation free energy because its
population occupies 56% of the whole considered MD snapshots. The
SMD simulations were carried out to unbind the Aβ trimer (chain
A, B, and C) from the monomer (chain D) as the modeling is shown in Figure 6, in which we have
assumed that the peptide is roughly symmetrical over the unbinding
direction.68

Figure 6 The modeling of the dissociation
process of the Aβ trimer
(chain A, B, and C) and monomer (chain D) using SMD simulations. The
pulling force was put on the trimer center of mass shown as the red
arrow. The blue spheres mentioned the N-terminus of the Aβ peptides.

During SMD simulations, the Aβ
trimer was rapidly forced
to dissociate from chain D. Interestingly, although the pulling force
was put on the center of mass of the trimer, the C-terminal mobilized
slower than the N-terminal during the dissociation process (Figure 6). Observations indicated
that the C-terminal adopts a stronger affinity to the corresponding
domain of other chains in comparison with the N-terminal. The obtained
results are in good agreement with the above structural analyses.
Furthermore, it is implied that the C-terminal is the probable nucleation
of the Aβ42 oligomers instead of the N-terminal in
the Aβ40 systems.30

The coordinates of the
whole system were monitored every ∼0.1 nm such that they would
be served as the initial conformations of the US calculations according
to the description in the Materials and Methods section. The sampling is guaranteed due to the overlap of histograms
(Figure S5). The free energy profile along
the unbinding pathway of the dissociation process was constructed
utilizing GROMACS tool “gmx wham”. The obtained potential
of mean force (PMF) of the US simulations is presented in Figure 7. The PMF-curve morphology
is in good agreement with previous studies.67,70 The PMF curve energizes starting at the zero value, then fall downs
to the lowest amount, finally the PMF value then increases to the
equilibrium state when ξ accomplishes ∼2 nm (Figure 7). The range is significantly
larger than that of the protein-ligand system (∼1.0 nm),67 which associates with the nonbonded cut-off.
It happens because the Aβ trimer structure was prolonged during
SMD simulations because the C-terminal is slower in motion than the
N-terminal. The PMF stable region indicates that the nonbond between
the trimer and the monomer is completely terminated. The free-energy
value ΔGUS was determined as the
variation between the smallest and largest values of the PMF according
to the explanation given in Figure 7. Here, the free energy value is ΔGUS = −58.44 ± 1.26 kcal/mol, whereas the error
was detected through 100 rounds of the bootstrapping estimation.71 The obtained binding free energy is approximately
at the same level with the corresponding metric of the U-shape Aβ17-42 system, which is −50.50 kcal/mol.68 Moreover, it is noted that the calculated free
energy ΔGUS is often larger than
the experimental amount.67,68,72 The difference is caused by the exaggeration of simulating the interaction
among component molecules, including the peptide and water molecules.73,74 The S-shape Aβ11–42 oligomer is approximately
stable like the U-shape Aβ17-42 system. In
other words, the observed probability of S-shape Aβ42 oligomers is seemingly similar to the U-shape systems.

free energy profile along the reaction coordinate
ξ was obtained from the PMF analysis using WHAM. The error was
earned through 100 rounds of the bootstrapping estimation.71

Conclusions
In summary, the S-shape 4Aβ11–42 peptide,
deriving from a photofibril structure, 2MXU,52 was mimicked over a long time MD simulations. The tetramer changes
over the first 4 μs of MD simulations, and then achieves the
equilibrium state during the last 6 μs of MD simulations. The
structural change study indicated that the S4Aβ11–42 oligomer is quite flexible involving a high dynamics N-terminal.
This may lead to difficulty in determining the oligomeric structures
of Aβ42 peptides in experiments.8 It was suggested that the C-terminal enables possible nucleation
in the self-assembly of the Aβ42 peptides. Moreover,
the size of the U-shape tetramer is smaller than that of the 4tmαAβ17-42 because of 10%
of CCS smaller. Over the secondary structure analysis, C-terminal
involving sequences 27–35 and 39–40 adopt rigid β-content,
whereas other residues including the hydrophobic domain of the N-terminal
(sequence 17–21) mostly adopt coil structures. The self-assembly
of the tetramer was assumed due to the collective variable free energy
landscape analysis that involves the self-aggregation pathway as shape B → shape C → shape A. The conformation A is a metastable structure, observing
with the population of 56%. This shape adopts 43% of β-content.
Furthermore, on the assumption that the system is symmetrical over
the unbinding direction (Figure 6), the dissociation free energy evaluation of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide was characterized using US simulations.
The obtained ΔGUS of S4Aβ11–42 is approximately the same as that of the U-shape
Aβ17-42.68 Thus,
the S4Aβ11–42 oligomer probably stabilizes
like the U-shape Aβ17-42 peptide. We anticipate
that the realized S4Aβ11–42 structures could
be used as targets for AD inhibitor screening in silico.

Materials and
Methods
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
GROMACS 5.1.3 was employed
to mimic the solvated S4Aβ11–42 peptide, which
was extracted from the Aβ11–42 fibril structure
with PDB ID: 2MXU.52 The peptides were represented using
an Amber99SB-ildn force field,75 referring
to a previous work,24,28,30 because the force field adopts the strongest agreement with NMR
and circular dichroism results.76 The peptide
was inserted into the dodecahedron periodic boundary condition box
with a size of ∼310 nm3 referring to previous works.77,78 Water molecules were treated by a TIP3P model79 and four Na+ ions were used to keep neutralization
of the system. The soluble system was consisted of approximately 31 000
atoms. The simulations were performed by following three steps including
energy minimization, equilibrium simulation (using short NVT and NPT simulations), and MD simulations. The parameters
of the MD simulations were chosen according to the previous study.10 In particular, the Langevin dynamics simulation
was employed to mimic the solvate Aβ system. The nonbond pair
is updated every 5 ps with a cut-off of 0.9 nm. The electrostatic
interaction was represented using the particle mesh Ewald with a cut-off
of 0.9 nm. The van der Waals interaction is effective when the pair
is smaller than 0.9 nm. During the simulation, all the bonds were
constrained using the LINCS method.80 The
conformational change of the S4Aβ11–42 peptide
was chased every 10 ps.

US Calculation
Dissociation free
energy of an edge
chain to the rest of S4Aβ11–42 is able to
characterize through the US simulations referring to a previous study.68 In particular, as mentioned above, the MD-refined
shape A was selected as the model of the unbinding process
analysis. Shape A was rotated until the unbinding pathway
along the reaction coordinate ξ as shown in Figure 6. The Aβ peptide was
then inserted into the new solvated PBC box with the size of 6.14
× 6.40 × 10.32 nm to provide appropriate space for the dissociating
system. The system thus consists of 4 Aβ11–42 monomers, 12 734 and 4 Na+ ions with 40118 atoms
totally.

The solvated system was then energy minimization before
the steered-MD approach was employed to unbind the Aβ11–42 trimer out of the rest of the monomer according to the description
given in Figure 6.
In particular, the Aβ monomer, which was noted as chain D, was
restrained using a weak harmonic force during the SMD simulations.
The center of mass of the Aβ trimer, including chain A, B, and
C, an externally harmonic force was applied with a spring constant
cantilever of k = 1000 kJ/mol/nm2 and
pulling speed of v = 0.005 nm/ps. The direction of
the pulling force is mentioned in Figure 6. Several snapshots recording the unbinding
process between the Aβ trimer and monomer were archived along
the reaction coordinate ξ. Thirty-one windows were selected
to perform the US simulations to evaluate the dissociation free energy
profile using the PMF calculations through WHAM analysis.69 The spacing between two neighboring windows
is ∼0.1 nm. A short NPT simulation length
100 ps with the positional-restrained condition was performed to relax
the solvated system. The relaxed systems were imposed to the US calculation
over 10 ns. There are entirely 3.1 μs of MD simulations employed
for US calculations.

Structural Analysis
The DSSP protocol46 was used to compute the S4Aβ11–42 secondary structure. The IMPACT package81 was employed to estimate the collisional cross section (CCS). The
rmsd, radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent
accessible surface area (SASA) were detected by GROMACS tools. An
intermolecular side-chain pair between various residues is available
when the spacing between the nonhydrogen atoms of different residues
is smaller than 0.45 nm. The FEL was generated using collective variables:
backbone rmsd and intermolecular side-chain contact.
