Spin
coating is a simple and rapid method for fabricating ordered
monolayer colloidal crystals on flat as well as patterned substrates.
In this article, we show how a combination of factors, particularly
concentration of the dispensed colloidal solution (Cn) and spin-coating speed, influences the ordering process.
We have performed systematic experiments on different types of substrates
with two types of colloidal particles (polystyrene and silica). We
also show that even when perfect ordering is achieved at some locations,
there might be a significant spatial variation in the deposit morphology
over different areas of the sample. Our experiments reveal that higher Cn is required for obtaining perfect arrays,
as the diameter of the colloids (dD) increases.
Interestingly, a combination of higher Cn and rotational speed (expressed as revolutions per minute) is required
to achieve perfect ordering on a topographically patterned substrate,
as compared to that on a flat surface, because of loss of inertia
of the particles during outward flow because of impact on the substrate
features. Finally, we also identify the relation between the particle
diameter and the height of the pattern features to achieve topography-mediated
particle ordering.

Introduction
It
is well-known that monodispersed colloidal particles self-assemble
into hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures, under appropriate conditions,
which are also known as two-dimensional (2D) colloidal crystals, and
find wide applications in fabrication of optical chips,1 photonic band gap materials and photonic crystals,2−4 data storage,5 chromatography,6 sensors,7 masks for
nanosphere lithography,8 etc. Various interfacial
self-assembly techniques, such as sedimentation,9 confined convective self-assembly,10 dip coating,11 drop casting and evaporative
drying,12 deposition during retraction
of liquid meniscus within a microfluidic chamber,13 electrophoretic deposition,14,15 self-assembly
at the gas–liquid interface,16,17 Langmuir–Blodgett
(LB) technique,18 inkjet printing,19 spray coating,20 spin
coating,21−41 and so forth, have been utilized to fabricate monolayer colloidal
crystals with HCP ordering. Almost all methods rely on the convective
assembly of particles engendered by lateral capillary forces, which
cause an attractive interaction between the particles that push them
together, favoring the nucleation of a close-packed ordered monolayer.
Surface stabilization of the particles is important to prevent uncontrolled
aggregation in the early stage of self-assembly.11 Methods such as sedimentation or electrophoretic deposition
are well suited for three-dimensional assembly, as they easily form
multilayers. Although dip coating and LB-based techniques are capable
of producing high-quality 2D crystals, they are inherently slow, require
large volume of colloidal solution, and are difficult to scale up.
It turns out that spin coating, which is widely used for coating polymer
thin films over large areas, is also well suited for creating 2D colloidal
crystals. Major advantages of spin coating include rapid formation
(∼few minutes), high-throughput, extremely low amount of colloidal
solution requirement (∼microliter), high degree of reproducibility,
scalability, and direct integration with standard microfabrication
approaches.

The possibility of creating a 2D monolayer array
of latex particles
[polystyrene (PS) beads] on a rigid substrate by spin coating was
first demonstrated by Deckman and Dunsmuir in early 80s.21,22 Subsequently, on the basis of this concept, Van Duyne pioneered
the concept of nanosphere lithography, which is widely used as a physical
mask for subsequent additive deposition of various types of materials.8,23 Monolayer arrays of many other types of colloids such as silica,
titania, core–shell particles, hollow titania spheres, and
nanoparticles of gold, silver, cobalt, etc. have been fabricated by
spin coating.24−26 Jiang and McFarland spin-coated a colloidal sol comprising
a mixture of a tri-acrylate monomer and a photoinitiator to fabricate
a well-ordered nonclose-packed hexagonal array. The monomer, which
acts as a spacer, is subsequently photopolymerized to form either
a polymer nanocomposite36 or a macroporous
polymer with reverse opal structure (in conjugation with etching),37 spanning over large areas.38 However, it is important to point out that as the spin-coating
process is radially symmetric about the center of rotation, it is
not possible to arrange all the particles in the form of a single
defect-free crystal spanning over the entire substrate.29 It has been shown by Yethiraj and co-workers
that under idealized conditions, it becomes possible to obtain crack-free
orientationally correlated polycrystal (OCP) structures,29,31 which comprise defect-free single-crystal domains radially arranged
with respect to the center of the film. While each single crystalline
domain laterally spans about 10 μm (represented with the correlation
length, lR), their orientation undergoes
continuous macroscopic rotation on length scales much larger than
the diameter of the colloidal particles.31 Application of an external magnetic field has been shown to be a
promising approach that enhances the uniformity of the deposited colloidal
particles, provided the colloids are magnetic in nature.39−41

Apart from monolayer arrays with HCP ordering, colloidal particles
arranged in a nonhexagonal manner also find applications in many exotic
areas such as optics and photonics and as sensing materials.42,43 Such arrays are typically created by depositing the colloids on
a chemically or a topographically patterned substrate, which acts
as a template. The possible formation of a topography-directed non-HCP
colloidal array was first reported by van Blaaderen et al. based on
gravity settling of silica particles, which was referred to as colloidal
epitaxy.44,45 Subsequently, several other techniques such
as micromoulding,46,47 electrostatic assembly,48 flow inside the microfluidic cell,49 dip coating,50 LB
technique,51 spin coating,52−57 and so forth have been used to obtain pattern-directed particle
arrays with a nonhexagonal geometry. A spin-coated pattern-directed
particle array was first demonstrated by Ozin and Yang where they
obtained non-HCP arrays of silica microspheres into anisotropically
etched square pyramid pits,52 based on
a combination of gravity-driven sedimentation and evaporation-induced
capillary forces, which lead to rapid settling, self-assembly, and
crystallization within the pits. Brueck and co-workers reported the
self-assembled array formation of sub-100 nm silica particles inside
line gratings and circular holes. They highlighted the critical role
of pH of the casting solution and showed that good ordering was possible
only when pH was 7.53 The same group showed
the possible fabrication of aligned multilayer particle arrays inside
deeper trenches, where the layer thickness could be controlled by
multiple spin-coating steps. Varghese et al. obtained size selective
array of particles within the pattern grooves from a mixture of particles
of different sizes.56

From the above
discussion, it is clear that spin coating is a simple
method, which can be used to fabricate monolayer colloidal crystals
with both HCP and non-HCP ordering on flat and patterned substrates,
respectively. However, in spin coating, particle array formation depends
on a combination of capillary, gravitational, centrifugal, and electrostatic
forces. The situation gets further complicated on a topographically
patterned substrate where the solution layer undergoes topography-mediated
rupture during spin coating.57−59 Further, because of symmetry
issues discussed already,29 as well as
nonplanarization of colloidal suspensions during spin coating from
a volatile medium,40 it becomes impossible
to achieve perfect ordering with the particles over a large area,
and at best crack-free OCP structures can be obtained.31 Colson et al. approached this complex parameter
optimization problem from the concept of Experimental Design and predicted
the optimum condition for obtaining a defect-free array over ASA ≈ 200 μm2 area.60 Most experimental papers
only report the optimized condition that offers a near perfect array,
and there are not too many systematic experimental studies that show
how the morphology varies with change in various input parameters.
Lack of such a study often renders it difficult to identify the conditions
for perfect ordering, particularly over large areas.

In this
article, we show the conditions under which perfect colloidal
arrays can form on flat as well as patterned surfaces of a variety
of materials based on systematic experimental investigations. Our
results show that a uniform array is formed within a narrow parameter
window spanning over large areas. The best structures we obtained
exhibit correlation length lR ≈
15 ± 2.5 μm and ASA ≈ 210 ± 12 μm2 in each single crystalline
domain comprising HCP monolayer arrays of the colloidal particles,
with no crack between adjacent domains over the entire sample surface
(15 mm × 15 mm). Such a structure will be referred to as “perfectly
ordered structure” in the subsequent section of the paper.
We show that such perfect ordering is achieved within a very narrow
parameter window that depends strongly on the diameter of the colloidal
particles (dD). We also show that there
can be a significant spatial variation in the morphology of the structures
and extent of ordering primarily because of nonplanarization of the
colloidal suspension,30 and therefore,
care must be taken to examine the structure at different locations
of the sample. We hope the reported results will act as a guide, particularly
for beginners to identify the actual optimized condition based on
a first trial that may lead to nonuniform deposition. Further, on
a patterned surface comprising grating geometry, we show how the morphology
of the ordered particles within the grooves depend on relative commensuration
between the particle diameter (dD) and
the groove width (lP), in addition to
the concentration of the particles in the colloidal solution (Cn). Finally, by coating the colloidal solution
on grating patterned substrates with the same periodicity (λP) and lP, but a different groove
depth (hP), we identify the minimum height
of the features necessary to successfully align the particles.

Results
and Discussion
Self-Assembly of PS Colloids on the Sylgard
184 Substrate
As discussed in the Introduction section,
the objective of the work is to identify the condition at which perfect
monolayer arrays of colloidal particles can be achieved. We performed
systematic experiments for each size and types of colloids on different
substrates by casting the sols with different colloidal concentrations
(Cn) at different revolutions per minute
(rpm), to find out the condition that leads to perfect ordering. Figure 1 highlights one such
optimization attempt, showing various degrees of ordering with PS
colloids having dD = 600 nm, as a function
of Cn and rpm on the UVO-exposed Sylgard
184 substrate. A UVO-exposed poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) substrate
is deliberately chosen as it is hydrophobic in nature (θE-W ≈ 109.5°). We show that it becomes possible
to create a perfect array even on a hydrophobic surface using methanol
as the solvent. However, it must be highlighted that because of UVO
exposure, the PDMS surface becomes almost completely wetted by methanol,
and therefore, ordered array formation gets favored.

Figure 1 Morphology of the colloidal
deposit at different Cn–rpm combinations,
when PS colloids with dD = 600 nm are
spin-coated on a flat UVO-exposed
PDMS substrate. The location is 4 mm away from the center of the substrate.

It may be noted that in all cases,
the surfactant used is sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and its concentration is 0.025 wt %. The presence
of surfactant molecules in the colloidal suspension in appropriate
quantity is essential for achieving perfect ordering, as they get
adsorbed on the particle surface and control the interaction between
the particles and surrounding. Self-assembly of colloidal particles
into monolayer colloidal crystals require repulsive interactions between
the particles, as strong attraction leads to the formation of highly
disordered structures.61 Though a detailed
analysis on how ordering is influenced by the surfactant concentration
is beyond the scope of the present study (and will be taken up separately),
we observed that disordered structures form both when the surfactant
concentration is very low (or absent) or higher than 0.1 wt %, when
micelles start to form. Apart from SDS, we could also obtain perfect
ordering using a nonionic surfactant (Triton-X). However, no ordering
could be achieved when a cationic surfactant [hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (HTAB)] was used. This is attributed to the Coulombic binding
of the positively charged head group of HTAB onto PS and silica particles,
both of which have negative surface charge, as verified by dynamic
light scattering measurements (data shown in Figure S1 of online Supporting Information). As the head group of
the cationic surfactant molecules adsorbs on the particle surface,
their hydrophobic tail orients outward and adjacent surfactant-covered
particles experience strong attraction in the presence of alcohol
because of hydration pressure. This leads to agglomeration and consequent
suppression of ordered crystal formation.

Before presenting
the experimental results, we feel it will be
appropriate to highlight the key theoretical results related to spin
coating,62−64 particularly some of the recent theoretical papers
which are specific to spin coating of colloidal dispersions.39−41 This will help us in qualitatively explaining some of the experimental
findings reported in this paper. It is well-known that in the initial
stage of spin coating, the dispensed solution flows radially outward
because of centripetal forces and the advancing solution meniscus
reaches the edge of the sample. The excess solution (including the
particles) is subsequently thrown out, which is known as splash drainage.
Spin coating of simple fluids has been modeled based on lubrication approximation ever since
the pioneering work of Emslie et al.,62 where the primary focus was to find out how film thickness (h) varies as a function of spinning time (t) and radial distance from the center of spinning (r). However, the model neglected the role of evaporation, and thinning
was considered only because of centrifugal forces. Meyerhofer subsequently
improved the model by incorporating the effect of evaporation by considering
spin coating to be a two-step process comprising two different stages:
(a) initial phase dominated by the radially outward flow and (b) evaporation-dominated
later stage where there is virtually no flow. The model considered
rate of evaporation (e) to depend on rpm as e ∝ (rpm)1/2.63 Subsequent improvement on spin-coating modeling was proposed by
Cregan and O’Brien,64 based on the
argument that solvent evaporation starts almost instantaneously with
deposition of the solution and therefore cannot be neglected even
in the initial phase. Although the model is based on lubrication approximation
and utilizes matched asymptotic expansion techniques, it considers
a constant rate of evaporation and predicts the deposited layer thickness
of the solute (not colloids) h∞(s) rather accurately and
is given as64 1  where C0 is the
initial solute concentration, γ is the kinetic viscosity, ω
is the angular velocity, and E is the rate of evaporation
of the solvent. Equation 1 can be simplified as 2  where  is constant for a specific
experimental
condition and β = 2/3.

The Cregan model was extended specifically
for colloids by González-Viñas
and co-workers, who argued that for a particulate system the film
thickness h∞(s) should be replaced by a term “compact-equivalent
height”, which depends on the kind of deposited structure and
can be calculated as the product of packing fraction and Vornoi cell
volume.65 Aslam et al. proposed that the
term h∞(s) in eq 1 for a simple solute should be replaced by compact-equivalent
height (CEH) for colloidal deposition, which gives 3  where the contact A1 can be obtained by simply replacing the solute
concentration C0 with the initial colloid
concentration (Cn) in the expression of A mentioned above. Further, for the submonolayer
deposit with a hexagonal structure, the expression of CEH is given
as41 4  where ϵ2 is the local occupation
factor, which is defined as the area occupied by the colloidal clusters
relative to the total area. In this paper, the term fractional surface
coverage (Fs) can be considered identical
to the occupation factor (ϵ2) used by Pichumani and
González-Viñas.39 It may
also be noted that we have written eq 4 in terms of dD, the diameter
of the colloidal particles, rather than the particle radius as in
refs (40) and (41).

Figure 1 shows the
morphology of the colloidal deposit obtained for various Cn–rpm combinations. At low rpm, the centripetal
force remains weak and therefore fails to spread the particles uniformly.
Thus, the evolution is dominated by viscous shear forces, which in
turn results in the particles getting arranged in a disordered fashion
(series A, Figure 1). As the rpm increases, the centripetal force becomes stronger,
resulting in uniform spreading. This also enhances the evaporation
rate up to a point where the forces acting on the colloidal particles
get balanced. Under this condition, the particles move on the substrate
surface easily and self-assemble into a monolayer with HCP ordering
that spans over a large area (frames B22, C33, and D44 of Figure 1). It also becomes
clear that the balance between the shear force and the drying rate
can only be maintained when Cn is increased
along with an increase in rpm. However, increase of Cn to much higher values leads to a sharp enhancement in
the viscosity of the remnant colloidal suspension during the late
stage of spinning. This hinders the mobility of the particles on the
substrate surface, and HCP ordering gets suppressed in favor of random
disorganized structures (frames B25 and C35, Figure 1). When the speed of rotation is increased
further, the radial outflow of the particles increases and consequently,
a larger amount of particles are thrown out of the substrate because
of splash drainage. Consequently, the remnant suspension rotating
on the substrate becomes very dilute. Consequently, the remaining
PS particles fail to form monolayer coverage on the substrate, though
they may show localized HCP ordering (series E, Figure 1).

The gradual morphology transition
along each column and row of Figure 1 highlights the influence
of enhanced rpm and Cn on the ordering
process, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the fractional
coverage of the surface (Fs) reduces with
an increase of rpm, for a given Cn, as
the proportion of splash drainage increases at higher rpm. On the
other hand, Fs gradually increases with
an increase in Cn for a constant rpm,
as more number of particles are initially dispensed on the substrate.
In fact, in most cases, the morphology gradually transforms from monolayer
with partial coverage to scattered multilayers with an increase in Cn, where the drying front fails to drag the
particles over the initially assembled particles.

Important
observation in Figure 1 is the formation of a perfectly ordered monolayer
with HCP ordering in frames B22, C33, and D44 (Fs ≈ 1.0). This means that a perfect monolayer coverage
is possible for different combinations of Cn and rpm. At this point, it is worth highlighting that all the images
in Figure 1 are captured
at a location which is approximately 4 mm away from the center of
the substrate. However, in order to claim that a specific coating
condition is optimum for achieving perfect crystalline ordering, it
is important to check the structure uniformity over the entire sample
substrate. We checked this by performing careful atomic force microscopy
(AFM) scan of the samples at different radial distances (rD) from the center of the sample at 1 mm intervals. The
samples chosen for this study include the ones which are seen to give
perfect ordering in Figure 1. In addition, few samples corresponding to different Cn–rpm combinations were also explored,
the details of which are mentioned in the legend of Figure 2A. We note that at an rpm of
200 as well as at a higher rpm (=2500), perfect ordering is not achieved
anywhere on the sample surface. For the low rpm case, the morphology
comprises a scattered multilayer over major portion of the substrate
(rD > 2 mm), indicating weak action
of
the centripetal force, which fails to drag the particles. On the other
hand, at higher rpm, the centripetal force is much higher than the
shear force and a large amount of particles are lost because of splashing.
Consequently, Fs never exceeds 50% over
the entire substrate. For the sample with Cn = 0.52% rotated at 400 rpm, we observe a slight undercoverage till rD ≈ 2 mm but a very high degree of multilayer
formation beyond rD > 5 mm. An opposite
trend is observed in the sample with Cn ≈ 1.2%, rotated at rpm = 1000. Here, a near perfect array
with Fs ≈ 1.0 is obtained in the
outer section of the sample (rD ≥
4 mm). However, the areas close to the center show a significant undercoverage
(Fs down to ≈0.75%). As can be
seen in Figure 2A,
the most uniform coverage is observed in the sample with Cn = 0.67%, rotated at rpm = 600. Thus, for PS colloids
with dD ≈ 600 nm, we identify a
combination of Cn = 0.67% and rpm = 600
to be optimum.

Figure 2 Variation of fractional coverage Fs as a function of distance from center (rD) for different Cn–rpm
combinations.
AFM images in insets (A1–A3) show perfectly ordered HCP morphology
at rD = 2, 5, and 7 mm. In all cases,
PS colloids with dD = 600 nm have been
used.

The trend in Figure 2A highlights the critical role
of solvent evaporation time on the
array formation. Unlike water, which has a vapor pressure = 3.17 kPa,
methanol has a much higher vapor pressure (13.02 kPa), which means
methanol evaporates much faster. Therefore, particle spreading can
take place only till the adequate amount of solvent is present. This
means at low rpm (200 and 400), even before major part of the particles
can reach the sample periphery, the solution starts to dry up, which
is also associated with the enhancement of viscosity, and therefore,
multilayers are formed toward the outer areas of the sample. Thus,
for an organic solvent, the balance of shear force and centripetal
force must be established within a very narrow time window, before
major part of the solvent evaporates away. This in turn allows perfect
array formation at Cn which is typically
much lower than that reported in the literature with an aqueous colloidal
sol, which also implies much reduced splash drainage of the colloidal
particles. Further, Figures 1 and 2 clearly highlight the success
of our work in obtaining a neat and perfect array on a hydrophobic
surface (θE-W ≈ 109°) of the cross-linked
PDMS substrate, UVO-exposed for 30 min (Table 1). In fact, Choi et al. have clearly mentioned
that it is nearly impossible to obtain a perfect array on a hydrophobic
surface.32 We show that this limitation
can be circumvented by using methanol as the solvent. The only requirement
is methanol must wet the surface, which is achieved by 30 min UVO
exposure, despite the substrate remaining hydrophobic.

with colloids of different sizes and of different materials. The optimized Cn–rpm combination is obtained by performing
experiments in line with Figures 1 and 2 for particles of each

In order
to highlight the dependence of the optimum condition on
simultaneous variation of several parameters, we construct morphology
phase diagrams. Two types of morphology phase diagram can be constructed,
which are shown in Figure 3. The phase diagram shown in Figure 3A can be constructed for each particle with
a specific dD—substrate combination
to identify the optimum condition. The diagram shown in Figure 3B is obtained by plotting each
of the optimum points obtained for different dD—substrate combinations. To generate a plot like the
one shown in Figure 3A, which is specific to PS particles with dD = 600 nm on UVO-exposed PDMS substrates at a location that
is 4 mm away from the center of the substrate, we classify the morphology
obtained at different Cn–rpm combinations
into three subcategories, which are perfectly ordered, underfilled,
and overfilled, as has been discussed in the context of Figure 1. The three distinct morphologies
are represented with different symbols. The information in Figure 2 is further used
to identify the Cn = 0.67% and rpm = 600
as the optimum condition which is marked with a square. It can further
be seen that the Cn at which transition
from underfilled to overfilled structures take places varies linearly
with rpm.

Figure 3 Morphology phase diagram (A) for PS colloids having dD = 600 nm on a UVO-exposed flat PDMS substrate and (B)
for colloids of different sizes on different types of flat substrates.
While each color represents colloid of a specific type and dD, each symbol represents a type of substrate,
as per legend provided in the figure.

Figure 3B
represents
the global morphology phase diagram which is constructed by using
the data reported in Table 2, each one of which has been obtained by constructing a particle
and substrate specific morphology phase diagram similar to that shown
in Figure 4A. Representing
data with simultaneous variation of four parameters (Cn, rpm, dD, and substrate
type) on a single plot was itself challenging, and therefore, the
logic adopted for representation needs to be mentioned. In the plot,
a particular color of the symbols represents particles of a specific dD. In contrast, different types of substrates
have been represented with different shapes of the symbols. The figure
highlights that for a particular type of particle, perfect ordering
is achieved on three polymeric substrates [PS, polymethylmethacrylate
(PMMA), and UVO-exposed PDMS] at nearly identical conditions. In contrast,
it emerges out from Figure 3B that a higher rpm is required to obtain perfect ordering
on glass and silicon substrates. This probably is a signature of slippage
of the solvent on a polymeric substrate and needs to be explored in
greater detail. Also, it becomes evident from both Figure 3B and Table 2 that for obtaining perfect ordering, Cn increases with an increase in dD, a trend that is counterintuitive, as lesser number
of larger particles are required to cover the same surface area, when dD is larger. It may however be explained rather
easily from eq 4, which
suggests that to achieve constant surface coverage (Fs) or occupation factor (ϵ2),  is proportional to dD.41 As Cn is very dilute, one may further argue that 1 – Cn ≈ 1, and hence, Cn exhibits direct proportionality with dD.

Figure 4 Morphology of the colloidal deposit at different Cn–rpm combinations, when PS colloids with dD = 600 nm are spin coated on the patterned
UVO-exposed PDMS substrate with type 2 geometry (λP = 1.5 μm).

Table 2 also reveals
that for a particular dD, the optimum Cn increases slightly, with lowering of the substrate
surface energy. This can be attributed to the reduced strength of
the particle–substrate interaction with lowering of γ.
However, how exactly the surfactant molecules adsorb on the substrate
and thus influence the ordering process is not fully clear and will
be analyzed separately. It can be seen that there is no monotonic
correlation of Cn and rpm with the substrate
surface energy for the formation of a perfect array, though the parameters
are quite close on various substrates. This observation is an indirect
evidence that the surface has a much lower role on the assembly, apart
from its wettability. We argue this happens because of the presence
of the surfactant molecules, which favor wetting of solution on the
substrate, which is the necessary condition for achieving ordering.

Template-Directed Assembly of Colloids
Particle Diameter Approximately
Equal to Pattern Line Width
(dD ≈ lP)
It is well-known that physical confinement provided by
the patterned substrate effectively traps the colloidal particles
during spin coating.51 The grooves act
as the preferred location for the deposition of the particles, as
the solvent layer ruptures over the substrate pattern protrusions.57 Consequently, the remaining liquid flows in
the grooves, localizing the colloids there. Subsequently, the lateral
capillary forces between the particles drive them to form closely
packed structures aligned along the grooves. It has also been recently
shown by Aslam et al. that a patterned substrate also eliminates axial
symmetry by spin coating and therefore suppresses the formation of
OCP structures.57

In this section,
we show how the morphology of the particle deposit varies as a combination
of Cn and rpm. As a test case, we examine
the ordering of dD = 600 nm PS particles
on the type 2 grating patterned substrate of the UVO-exposed cross-linked
PDMS. For a type 2 substrate, the groove width is lP ≈ 750 nm, the groove depth is hP ≈ 250 nm, and the periodicity is λP ≈ 1.5 μm. Using a substrate of the same material
as that in Figure 1 allows direct comparison between the conditions that leads to a
perfect ordering on a flat substrate and a patterned substrate. As dD and lP are comparable,
we consider that the particle and the patterned substrate are commensurate.

Figure 4 shows various
deposition morphologies of dD = 600 nm
PS particles on type 2 substrate, obtained at different Cn–rpm combinations. The trend is similar to that
observed on a flat surface; for a particular Cn, Fs-P (surface coverage
or fill fraction on a patterned substrate) gradually reduces with
an increase in rpm because of higher splash drainage. On the other
hand, increase of Cn at a constant rpm
leads to the deposition of more particles, leading to disorder, as
particles get deposited on top of the stripes, after filling the grooves
(frames A14, A15, B24, and B25 of Figure 4). Among all the frames of Figure 4, perfect ordering is observed
in frame B23 for a parameter combination of Cn = 0.75% and rpm = 1000. It is interesting to note that perfect
ordering on a patterned substrate requires higher Cn as well as higher rpm for particles with the same dD as compared to the flat substrate of the same
material. This means that on a patterned substrate, more number of
particles are required for perfect ordering. This is counterintuitive
as perfect ordering on a grating patterned substrate implies that
particles align only inside the grooves, and therefore, only about
50% of the number of particles is required to achieve the same, in
comparison to a perfect HCP structure on a flat surface (Fs ≈ 1.0). The observation can be explained well
with the help of eq 4 (modified Cregan model).41 As Fs (or ϵ2) is almost half on
a grating patterned substrate, as compared to that on a flat substrate,
CEH on a patterned substrate is also approximately half than that
on a flat substrate. From eq 3, we note that CEH = A1ω–β. Figure 4 shows that Cn = 0.75% for perfect ordering on a patterned substrate, which is
compared to a value of Cn = 0.67% on a
flat surface (Figure 2). As the values of Cn are rather close
to each other, the values of  are also rather close on a flat and a patterned
substrate. Thus, from eq 4, lower CEH becomes possible on a patterned substrate only when ω
is higher as compared to that on a flat substrate.

We summarize
the optimized conditions for obtaining perfectly ordered
structures (Fs-P ≈ 1.0)
on type 1 and type 2 substrates of different materials, with both
silica and PS colloids of different sizes, as presented in Table 3, by performing experiments
in line with Figure 4 for particles of each dD on each type
of patterned substrate. Figure 5A shows the perfectly ordered structure obtained with silica
colloids having dD = 350 nm on a patterned
type 1 PMMA substrate, under conditions mentioned in Table 3. Interestingly, on patterned
substrates, we find that the rpm at which perfect ordering is obtained
for a particular colloid is independent of the substrate material,
though Cn differs slightly from substrate
to substrate. This clearly highlights the critical role of colloidal
spreading on the formation of perfect structures, rather than the
particle–substrate interaction, which seems to influence the
ordering process weakly. The results imply that the evolution during
spinning up to the stage of topography-mediated rupture of the solvent
layer is not much influenced by the substrate. Also, as already discussed,
in all cases higher rpm is required for obtaining a perfect array,
as compared to that on a flat substrate of the same material.

Until this point, we
have considered a perfectly ordered structure
to be one where only the grooves are completely filled up by the colloids
in an uninterrupted threadlike manner (Fs-P ≈ 1.0). However, Figure 5B shows another interesting morphology where the entire
patterned substrate is covered in a near HCP manner by PS colloids
(dD = 600 nm). The section B1—B1
in the inset of Figure 5B shows that some particles are at a lower level as compared to others.
This happens when Cn is adequately high
and they start depositing covering the entire patterned substrate.
The particles which lead to within the grooves arrange themselves
in a zigzag threadlike manner. The remaining particles, which deposit
over the substrate stripes, align themselves in an interesting arrangement
of alternate single and double particles along the length of the stripes,
alongside the particle thread formed within the groove. The arrangement
is schematically shown in inset (B2) of Figure 5B. This structure forms when Cn ≈ 2.5% and rpm = 1000. Because lP is higher than dD, the particles
align in a zigzag fashion inside the grooves, allowing more particles
to pack themselves side by side over the stripes. As larger number
of particles are dispensed (Cn for optimum
coverage = 0.75%, as per Table 3) on the surface, the applied centripetal force fails to splash
out significant fraction of the excess particles that are available
after filling of the grooves. The morphology is novel and highlights
that the hexagonal arrangement still leads to minimum energy configuration
even if the particles remain at multiple levels.

Effect of Template
Height on Pattern-Directed Assembly
In this section, we show
how the feature height (hP) of the substrate
patterns influences the pattern-directed
ordering. For this purpose, type 2 substrates of different hP were used. The experiments were performed
with dD = 600 nm PS colloids so that the dD and λP remain commensurate.
The initial Cn–rpm combination
chosen was the same as that which is seen to give perfect ordering
in Figure 4, frame
B23. It can be seen that perfect pattern-directed ordering is obtained
till hP ≈ 150 nm, when the Cn–rpm combination was kept unaltered.
It can be seen in Figure 6B that the ordering is lost when hP ≈ 125 nm. The uniqueness of Figure 6B can be understood by comparing it with
frames A13–A15 and B24–B25 of Figure 4 which also shows distorted arrays on patterned
substrates. However, in all those frames of Figure 4, the grooves are totally filled and the
excess particles are seen to get localized over the stripes, resulting
in disorder. In contrast, in Figure 6B, the particles are seen to accumulate over the stripe
tops, despite some grooves remaining vacant. This means that during
the radial outward flow, the hP of the
features is too low to intercept the flow and guide the particles
within the grooves. When we performed similar experiments with dD = 300 nm on type 1 substrates of different hP, we observed that ordering gets lost below hP ≈ 75 nm. The trend, including the critical hP below which topography-guided ordering is
lost, is nearly similar for all substrates having identical pattern
topography. It can be seen that the limiting value of hP/dD lies between 0.2 and
0.25 below which the topography of the substrate patterns fails to
provide confinement to the particle organization process. On the basis
of the first results reported in this article, a detailed investigation
on this problem will be taken up separately. Similar transition from
order to disordered structures with gradual reduction of hP has been observed earlier in the context of pattern-directed
dewetting of thin polymer films.66 A detailed
investigation on this topic is underway. It will be particularly interesting
to explore if there is a critical hP around
which there will be a transition from OCP structures to purely template-guided
ordered structures, which is likely to depend on dD of the colloids as well.

in template-guided assembly of PS colloids
(dD = 600 nm) on type 2 gratings of height
(A) 150 and (B) 125 nm.

Particle Diameter Smaller Than Pattern Line Width (dD < lP)
In Figure 7, we show how the
morphology of the deposit depends when dD is much smaller than the groove width of the patterned substrate.
Unlike all the earlier cases, where perfect ordering means a single
thread of particles aligned along the substrate groove, more complex
ordering is possible when dD and lP are noncommensurate. We produce one such example
with dD = 300 nm PS particles coated on
type 2 PMMA substrate, which has lP =
750 nm. While we obtained a variety of morphologies depending on the
combination of Cn and rpm, we report the
morphology which can be considered as the perfectly ordered structure
and can be considered analogous to Figure 4, frame B23. In Figure 7, the laterally coexisting particles are
seen to arrange in a hexagonal manner, though they are aligned along
the groove.

Conclusions
In this article, we have systematically
demonstrated the conditions
under which perfect arrays of monodispersed colloids can be obtained
on both defect-free flat and topographically patterned substrates
of different materials, using spin coating. On the flat surface, we
obtained structures that exhibit correlation length lR ≈ 15 ± 2.5 μm and ASA ≈ 210 ± 12 μm2 in
each single crystalline domain comprising HCP monolayer array of the
colloidal particles, with no crack between adjacent domains over the
entire sample surface (15 mm × 15 mm). We have shown in details
the optimization process, and the role of individual parameters, particularly Cn and rpm on the extent of ordering process
and constructed a morphology phase diagram to highlight the collective
role of Cn and rpm on perfect ordering
with particles of different sizes on different surfaces. We have also
highlighted the need to check the spatial variation of the as-cast
morphology, as there can be a significant variation in the extent
of ordering and Fs over the surface. Our
results also highlight the critical role of surfactants added on the
formation of uniform particle arrays, which might eventually open
up a new route to overcome the nonplanarization effect in spin coating,
particularly from a volatile organic solvent. Our intention is that
the report will significantly help beginners in the area to quickly
optimize the parameters by identifying the nature of the defect in
the structure and appropriately modulating either rpm or Cn. To facilitate this, we have highlighted the likely
types of defects that may result when Cn and/or rpm is low or high. We also show that higher Cn is required for obtaining perfect arrays with larger dD particles, which is in line with the recent
theoretical predictions on the spin coating of colloidal particles
by Aslam et al.41

On a patterned
surface, we note that both higher rpm and Cn are required for obtaining perfect ordering,
which can be attributed to lower Fs as
compared to that on a flat surface and has been explained well from
the theory. We also explored how the ratio of dD and hP can influence the ordering
process. If the features are shallower than 20% of the particle diameter,
then the patterns fail to confine the particles. Or in other words,
a grating much shallower than the particle diameter is sufficient
for confining the particles. We also report the formation of novel
multielevation structures under certain conditions when the topographically
patterned substrate is fully covered with particles at high Cn, as well as interesting structure comprising
an array of particle doublets when dD is
nearly 50% of lP.

As a final summary,
we understand that 2D monolayer colloidal array
formation on both flat and patterned substrates by spin coating is
a complex problem because of its multiparameter nature. While we have
carefully examined the dependence of Cn and rpm on the ordering process, various other parameters such as
effect of surfactant type and concentration, relative commensuration
between particle size and pattern geometry, and so forth also influence
the ordering process, which needs detailed investigation.

Materials and
Methods
Substrates
Glass slides, silicon wafer, films of cross-linked
PDMS, PS (molecular weight: 280 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich USA), and PMMA
(molecular weight: 120 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich USA) were used as different
substrates. The size of the substrates was 15 mm × 15 mm. The
glass and silicon substrates were cut from glass slides and silicon
wafer (test grade, Wafer World Inc.) respectively. They were subsequently
cleaned following a standard procedure. All polymer films were spin-coated
on cleaned glass pieces. The thickness of the PDMS film was ∼10
μm, which was obtained by spin-coating a degassed mixture of
part A to part B (1:10 wt/wt) of Sylgard 184 (a thermo curable, PDMS-based
elastomer, Dow Corning, USA) in n-hexane (SRL, India)
at 2500 rpm for 1 min. The coated film was cured at 120 °C for
12 h in an air oven for complete cross-linking. The thickness of the
PS and PMMA films was ∼500 nm, which was obtained by coating
dilute solutions [10% (w/v) PS and PMMA] in toluene on the glass slides
at 2500 rpm for 1 min. After coating, the PS and PMA films were annealed
at 60 °C for 3 h in a vacuum oven to remove the remnant solvent.
All the flat substrates were characterized using an atomic force microscope.
Contact angle goniometry (ramé-hart Instrument Co.) was used
to measure the water and methanol contact angle on each of the substrates,
which along with the substrates surface energy are listed in Table 1.

All the substrates
were used as it is, except cross-linked PDMS substrates which were
not wetted by the solvent (methanol). To make it wettable, the cross-linked
PDMS substrates were exposed to UVO (PSD Pro UV–O, NovaScan,
USA). UV irradiation at 185 nm wavelength leads to the production
of ozone from atmospheric oxygen. The ozone molecules, in turn, dissociate
into oxygen at 254 nm irradiation.67 The
reactive oxygen radicals, thus created, attack the methyl groups present
in Sylgard 184 (Si–CH3) and replace them with silanol
groups (Si–O–H), hence generating a superficial oxide
layer of higher surface energy and leads to enhanced wetting of the
samples. The drastic drop in methanol contact angle on the UVO-cured
PDMS substrate can be observed in Table 1.

Patterned Substrates
Some PS, PMMA,
and PDMS films
were patterned using topographically patterned stamps, which were
obtained from peeling the foils of commercially available optical
data storage disks such as DVD and CD.68 The PS and the PMMA films were patterned using capillary force lithography.69,70 The cross-linked PDMS films were patterned using a UVO-mediated
soft embossing technique reported elsewhere.68 The morphology of all three films patterned using the same stamps
was identical, implying the formation of a perfect negative replica
of the stamp pattern, which was verified using an atomic force microscope.
While the grating patterns obtained with a DVD foil has the periodicity
λP ≈ 750 nm, groove width lP ≈ 350 nm, and groove depth hP ≈ 100 nm (Figure S6, online Supporting Information, marked as type 1 patterns), the films
patterned with a CD foil has λP ≈ 1.5 μm,
groove width lP ≈ 750 nm, and groove
depth hP ≈ 250 nm (Figure S7, online Supporting Information, marked as type 2 patterns).

Grating patterns with the same λP but different hP was obtained following stress relaxation-associated
imprinting of partially precured PDMS films, which is reported in
detail elsewhere.71,72 In short, PDMS films of different
viscoelasticities were created by precuring the films for different
durations before embossing. These films, once imprinted with flexible
foils, underwent stress relaxation, which resulted in films with different hP. Figure 8A shows the hP of different
PDMS substrates used in our study, created as a function of precuring
time (tP) of the PDMS film. Figure 8B1,B2 shows the cross-sectional
line profiles of the type 1 and type 2 patterns having different hP.

Colloidal Particles
Monodispersed colloids of PS with
diameters dD ≈ 300, 600, and 800
nm were purchased from Sigma, UK. Monodisperse silica particles of
diameter (dP) ≈ 350 nm were synthesized
following Stöber’s method by the hydrolysis of tetraethyl
orthosilicate (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich)
medium in the presence of ammonium hydroxide (28%, Sigma-Aldrich)
as a catalyst.73 The details about the
reaction can be found in the online Supporting Information (Section S4.0).

Prior to spin coating, dilute
solution of PS and silica colloids in methanol was mixed with 0.025
wt % (unit of Cn is in terms of wt/vol
%) solution of SDS (purest grade purchased from Merck, India) in methanol
to stabilize the colloidal dispersion and was sonicated in a water
bath for 1 h. All the results reported in this paper are with SDS.
However, in some cases, a nonionic surfactant (Triton-X) or a cationic
surfactant (HTAB) was also used. It is quite clear that the presence
of surfactants favors better ordering, and therefore, surfactant concentration
is going to be an important factor influencing the morphology of the
deposits. A detailed analysis on how the nature and concentration
of the surfactant influence the ordering process will be analyzed
separately.

Spin-Coated Array Fabrication
For
spin coating, the
bare substrate (mounted onto the chuck) was first started to rotate
and allowed to attain the final rotational velocity. Subsequently,
100 μL of the stabilized colloidal dispersion was dispensed
on the rotating substrate using a micropipette. This protocol of dispensing
the colloidal suspension was adopted to minimize the effects of acceleration
on the sample. Coating over all the samples was performed at a room
temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 30%. The rpm
and the colloid concentration (Cn) vary
from sample to sample and are mentioned in the appropriate sections.
The morphology of the colloidal arrays was investigated using an atomic
force microscope (Agilent Technologies, AFM 5100) in intermittent
contact mode using a silicon nitride cantilever (PPP-NCL, Nanosensors
Inc., USA) and a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM7610F,
JEOL, Japan). For every AFM image, the fractional coverage (Fs) was calculated using the “slice”
feature of Pico Image Basic (Version 5.1), an integrated AFM imaging
and analysis software package. Details about the calculation procedure
of Fs can be found in Section S5.0 of
the online Supporting Information
