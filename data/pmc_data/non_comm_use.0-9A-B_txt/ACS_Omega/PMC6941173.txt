Cavitation phenomenon in dielectric fluids has been a
recent topic
of interest in theory and experiment. We study a dielectric fluid–nanoparticle
system subjected to an external electric field using molecular dynamics
simulations. Electric fields ranging from 0.042 to 0.25 V/Å are
applied to a water and tin dioxide system. Cavitation is observed
in simulations with both SPC/E water and the hydrogen bonding polarizable
model. The cavitation onset time displays a stretched exponential
relaxation response with respect to the applied electric field with
an exponent β = 0.423 ± 0.08. This is
in accordance with the exact theoretical value for systems with long-ranged
forces. Cavity growth rates are divided into two phases, a spherical
growth phase and a cylindrical one. Both are reported as a function
of the applied electric field. The structure of the electric field
is analyzed both spatially and temporally.

Introduction
The formation and use of cavities within
fluids are rich areas
of research and practical applications. Nanobubbles have been used
for water treatment, aiding fermentation, and targeted delivery of
pharmaceuticals.1,2 The water jets formed from collapsing
nanobubbles can cause structural damage and erosion to important components
and, more productively, aid in manufacturing materials.3 Bubble collapse-induced sonoluminescence has
been observed.4 Typically, cavities arise
in the form of gaseous bubbles; however, in this paper, the formation
of cavities due to electrostrictive forces will be discussed.

Cavity formation due to negative pressure in water has been the
subject of experimental and theoretical work.5,6 According
to the classic nucleation theory, the energy required to generate
a spherical void of radius R in a fluid with surface
tension σ and pressure P is equal to7 1  

The term for the cavity’s
internal vapor pressure has been
excluded as the cavities discussed in this paper have a negligible
vapor pressure compared to the internal fluid pressure. Equation 1 implies, for negative pressures,
the existence of a critical radius above which it will be energetically
favorable for the cavity to continue to grow. Negative pressure can
be induced in water (or any dielectric fluid) through the application
of a spatially inhomogeneous external applied electric field. This
induced negative pressure in a dielectric fluid is given by 2  where ϵ0 is
the vacuum permittivity, ϵ is the dielectric constant of the
liquid media, E is the applied electric field, and
α is a constant that ranges between 1.3 and 1.5 for most polar
liquids.8 Negative pressure in water has
been measured through the Berthelot method with pressures ranging
from −3.4 to −12 MPa across temperatures ranging from
275 to 300 K; however, the accuracy of these results has been questioned.9 Negative pressures exceeding −100 MPa
were achieved using water inclusions in quartz;10 however, in the studies done by Green et al.,11 each inclusion was only studied a few times
or even only once. A better understanding of a cavity formation statistics
was provided by Azouzi et al.5 in which
a single inclusion was studied repeatedly. Direct observation of cavities
through Rayleigh scattering has been proposed, but to date, no experiments
have been carried out.12 The Shneider,
Pekker, and Fridman theory of void formation has been experimentally
verified.12 Water subjected to pulses with
rise times of 600 ps to 3 ns were found to generate nanocavities through
electrostrictive forces.13 Cavitation did
not occur with longer rise times as the liquid had sufficient time
to respond to the forces without rupturing. The theoretical explanation
of cavity formation in the presence of a strong, inhomogeneous electric
field is found in the work of Shneider and Pekker.6

The previous theoretical work cited above has shown
the genesis
of cavities when a spatially inhomogeneous external field is applied;
however, through molecular dynamic simulations, we have witnessed
the formation of cavities in water subjected to a spatially constant
applied electric field. Inhomogeneities in the local electric field
occur due to the presence of the tin dioxide nanoparticle. This phenomenon,
in turn, leads to void cavitation formation. Simulations of a 1.5
nm SnO2 nanoparticle immersed in water were performed using
LAMMPS (https://lammps.sandia.gov/index.html).14−16 Electric fields ranging from 0.042 to 0.25 V/Å
were applied along the x axis. While the simulated
electric field strengths are quite high, water has been experimentally
subjected to electric fields between 0.1 and 0.5 V/Å using electrode
tips on the order of hundreds of nanometers.17

Results and Discussion
The local electric field was
calculated at the location of each
atom by dividing the Coulomb force felt by the atom by the atomic
charge. After the initial application of the electric field (occurs
over 1 fs), the average x component of the effective
electric field rapidly increased until it reached a saturation value
(Figure 1a). We have
defined the saturation time ts to be the
time required for the effective electric field to reach 95% of its
maximum value. The average electric field remained stable with oscillations
of at most 5% for tp < t < tonset. The changes in the electric
field near the onset of cavitation will be discussed below. The saturation
value decreased (Figure 1b), and the pulse time increased exponentially (Figure 1c) as the applied electric
field decreased. The time resolution in these calculations is 1 ps.
For Eapp > 0.125 V/Å, a smaller timescale is needed for accurate measurements. The saturation
time increases from between 3 and 4 ps for a 0.25 V/Å applied
field to 20 ps for the 0.0524 V/Å field. Analysis of the log E versus log tp of the data
in Figure 1 yielded
a slope of −0.97, which indicates an exponential dependence.
The total electric field increased linearly with the applied electric
field; however, there was a scaling factor of approximately 3.6. This
increase in total electric field strength is attributed to the polarization
of the water molecules and resulting dipole moment of the periodic
simulation boxes.18 The effective electric
field for a constant applied electric field is given by 3  where Edp is the electric field due to the dipole moment of the box 4  where p is the
total dipole of the box, the sum is over all dipoles within the box, r is the distance from an individual dipole to the position
where E is being measured, and θ is the angle between
the dipole and the distance vector between the dipole and measurement
point.19 If we let p = αEapp where α is the
effective polarizability of the box, then the effective electric field
becomes 5

structure of electric field. (a) Average x component
of the electric field versus time for different
applied electric field strengths. (b) Time it takes for the electric
field to reach 95% of the saturation value. (c) Magnitude of the saturation
value for the electric field versus applied electric field. (d) The x dependence of the x component of the
electric field at different time steps corresponds to the initial
application of the field, the rise, and the saturation for an applied
field of 0.125 V/Å.

Noting that our electric field scales as 3.6 times
the applied
electric field, the second term in eq 5 must evaluate to 2.6. For steady-state electric fields,
the dipole component has been found to be larger than the applied
electric field itself, which is in agreement with our results. This
would suggest that the dipole relaxation of the water molecules is
responsible for the electric field pulses seen in Figure 1a. Figure 1d shows the x component
of the electric field at t = 0, 1, 5, and 10 ps for Eapp = 0.125 V/Å. From these results, it can
be seen that, during this initial pulse, only the magnitude of the
electric field changes, while the structure of the electric field
does not change. In the absence of a nanoparticle, the pulse occurs
on similar timescales (between 3 and 4 ps for 0.25 V/Å); however,
cavitation is not observed. This reaffirms that the nanoparticle is
required for cavitation in this system. Furthermore, this suggests
that alteration of the local electric field is what induces the cavitation.

Figure 2a shows
a snapshot of a simulation shortly after cavity genesis. The time
of cavitation onset (Tonset) was found
to relate to the applied electric field through a stretched exponential
relaxation response 6  where E̅ = E/Emax is the electric
field divided by the maximum applied electric field (Emax = 0.25 V/Å). The value for β was 0.424
± 0.09 (Figure 2). The value for β was found by plotting log( – log
(E̅)) versus log Tonset and finding the weighted line of best fit (Figure 2b,c). The fitting weights were
based on the error associated with each Tonset measurement (±1 ps). These values are very close to the “magic”
values found in the stretched exponential response theory.

of the system just after cavitation. (b) E̅ versus t: blue markers are the data used to calculate
the exponential relaxation coefficient β. The temporal data
span an order of magnitude (60 to 635 ps). The red line is the fitted
line of best fit. (c) The blue line is the plotted stretched exponential
function with β = 0.424 and τ = 134.6 ps.

Stretched exponential relaxation has been used
to explain relaxation
in glasses and dielectrics.20−22 Across decades of experiments
in a wide range of systems, a few magic values for β have arisen.
One of the early explanations was the trapping model, in which entropic
excitations diffuse freely through the phase space until they reach
sinks where they become stuck.22 The stretched
exponential nature then arises as a result of the excitations near
the sink being diminished quickly while farther away excitations taking
increasing lengths of time due to their distance from the sink. This
model predicts a value for β of 7  where d is
the dimensionality of the system. Phillips,22 using the wealth of experimental data, proposed an axiomatic model
with the axiom 8  where d*
= fd, and f is the number of short
range forces available for relaxation divided by the number of long-ranged
forces. A topological justification of this model can be found in
ref (23). For a system
such as the one studied in this paper with one short-ranged interaction
per atom type (Lennard–Jones/Buckingham) and one long-ranged
force (the Coulomb force), one would expect f = 1/2,
yielding β = 3/7. Further discussion on the
interpretation of β can be found in the Supporting Information.

Figure 3a–f
shows the evolution of the cavity with respect to time for an applied
field of 0.042 V/Å. Snapshots shown are from 500, 650, 750, 850,
1000, and 1100 ps. The cavity volume as a function of time is shown
for the duration of the simulation in Figure 3g. Between 500 and 650 ps, the cavity begins
to form in front of the nanoparticle. Between approximately 650 and
730 ps, the cavity forms and expands roughly spherically at a rate
of approximately 24.7 Å3/ps. The cavity then expands
cylindrically at a rate of 92.78 Å3/ps for 150 ps.
After the initial sphere phase, the cavity grows in a cigar-like fashion:
First, a small tendril of the cavity extends in the direction of the
electric field, away from the midpoint of the nanoparticle, and then
it expands outward until the segment reaches the same cyclindrical
radius as the rest of the cavity. The cavity stabilizes for a period
of 90 ps until it continues to grow at a reduced rate of 29 Å3/ps. Between 1050 and 1100 ps, the outermost (from the nanoparticle)
segment broke off and collapsed. Yet, in that time span, the overall
cavity volume continued to expand. During this new regime, the volume
increase comes from an expansion in the radial direction.

(e) 1050, and (f) 1100 ps. (g) Cavity volume as a function of time
with red X’s over the data points corresponding to (a)–(f).

An explanation for the cylindircal growth of the
void cavity is
found in the literature.8 The equation
for square magnitude of the electric field near a spherical void is
given by 9  with θ donating the
angle between r and the external applied electric
field Eapp. The volumetric force near the
pore (R < r < 2.5R) then becomes8  

Notice that, when θ = 0, which
is in line with the external
applied electric field, the electric field is minimized and the force
is positive (pointing radially outward). As θ increases, the
electric field in this region increases and the force becomes less
positive until it becomes negative between π/8 and π/4. This would explain the cigar shape
found in the simulations.

There were two apparent growth phases
in cavitation genesis: an
initial spherical phase and a longer-lasting cylindrical growth phase.
From inspection of Figure 4, two distinct growth slopes emerge. Generally, both phases
grew at increased rates as the electric field strength was increased.
The volume growth appears to grow linearly; however, the data are
too noisy to determine this definitively. A description of how the
void volumes were calculated can be found in the Supporting Information.

volume analysis. Cavity volume as a function of time for
different applied electric fields. In most of the curves, two distinct
regions of near-linear growth appear. The first curve corresponds
to the spherical growth phase, while the second one corresponds to
the cylindrical growth phase.

The x component of the electric
field was calcualted
by dividing the Coulomb force by atomic charge for each hydrogen and
TIP4P dummy atom of water and each tin and oxygen atom corresponding
to tin dioxide (Figure 5). The x component of the electric field was averaged
and compressed into the y-z plane
(Figure 5a,d,g) and
along the x axis (Figure 5b,e,f). The snapshots were taken from the Eapp = 0.125 V/Å run. The nanoparticle disrupts
the otherwise constant electric field, which produces the inhomogeneity
required for cavity formation. Once the bubble has formed (t = 100 ps), the average electric field in the water spikes
heavily in the plane around the bubble, in agreement with eq 9, while seeing a slighly
reduced electric field near the leftmost edge. The internal electric
field strength in the absence of an externally applied electric field
has been found to be between 1.5 and 2.5 V/Å24 with only modest alterations due to a comparatively weaker Eapp. This is in line with the electric field results
in Figure 5.

Summary
We have observed cavitation in MD simulations
of a SnO2 nanoparticle immersed in water modeled by SPC/E
and the hydrogen
bonding polarizable force fields. The results from these simulations
describe a general phenomenon. Cavity growth rates indicate spherical
and cylindrical growth phases. These growth phases are analyzed as
a function of the applied electric field, and the simulation data
are consistent with the theoretical calculation for a cigar-shaped
cavity near the nanoparticle. A more precise anaylsis of the cavity
shape and evolution will be the subject of future work. The cavitation
onset time as a function of the applied electric field displays a
stretched exponential relaxation response with a universal value for
the exponent, β = d*/(d* + 2) = 3/7, for systems with long-ranged forces. Identifying
the long timescale value of β provides evidence for the most
likely mechanism behind cavitation; that is, the thermally activated
cavities diffuse into the main cavity by the nanoparticle. These results
can be verified by creating a solution of tin dioxide nanoparticles
suspended in water and creating a sufficiently strong electric field
through the use of a fast pump laser and observing cavitation with
the free electron laser facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.25 The Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC
has been used to successfully study fragile proteins26 and to investigate femtosecond timescale phenomenon.27 The same techniques could be used to probe our
system. Experimental verification of these simulations will provide
an interesting direction for further research.

Computational Methods
Cavitation was observed with
both SPC water and polarizable water
force fields; however, the simulations discussed within this paper
were all done with a combination of the SnO2 force field
developed by Bandura et al.7 with the hydrogen
bonding polarizable (HBP) water force field.28 Further details on the force fields can be found in the Supporting Information.

Bulk crystal SnO2 was simulated to generate nanoparticles.
The equilibrated nanoparticle was then placed into a prepared water
box. Finally, the combined system was used to run the electric field
simulations described below. All simulations were done using LAMMPS.
The default velocity Verlet integrator was used with a time step of
1 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were used in every simulation.

The 199,970-atom combined water and nanoparticle system was used
at the starting point for the simulations described in this paper.
Simulations ran from 100 ps to 1.2 ns. Uniform electric fields ranging
from 0.042 to 0.25 V/Å were applied along the x direction. Electric field strengths above 0.25 V/Å were ignored
because force fields that can deal with bond breaking such as ReaxFF
are required as water will dissociate at such high field strengths.
The Ewald summation method was used with tin-foil boundary conditions
to calculate the Coulomb force with a maximum relative error in the
forces of 1.0 × 10–5.
