Butyl
levulinate (BL) is a versatile chemical utilized widely in
food and chemical industries, the production of which by using cellulose
in biomass resources is of great significance to its sustainable development.
Traditional synthesis processes for n-butyl levulinate
are confronted with various problems such as high cost of raw materials,
difficulty in separating products, etc. In this paper, a novel process
for the preparation of BL from cellulose is proposed. The process
is composed of five main unit operations including fed-batch hydrolysis,
decolorization, extraction, esterification and purification. A 171.63
g/L concentration of the intermediate levulinic acid was obtained
at the fifth feeding through the fed-batch hydrolysis process. The
resin-activated carbon secondary decolorization method was adopted
to remove the soluble humin byproducts with an accumulative decolorization
rate of 89%. In the extraction process, the product BL was chosen
as the extractant to avoid the introduction of new impurities. After
purification, the purity of the final product BL reaches up to 98
wt %. The proposed technique allows for cost-effective and eco-friendly
production of BL from biomass resources.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biomass resources are
known as low cost, renewable, extensive,
and innocuous to the environment, the utilization of which to produce
correlative chemicals is of great significance to sustainable development.1,2 Cellulose, as a typical biomass resource, can be converted into
biofuel and chemicals through biological or chemical methods3,4 such as bioethanol,5 levulinic acid (LA),6 LA esters,7 etc. Among
them, LA esters are very promising chemicals, which can be used not
only as fragrances, food additives, and plasticizers8−10 but also as important intermediates in chemical and pharmaceutical
industries.11,12 In addition, due to similar properties
to biodiesel, LA esters can be applied as blend fuels and additives
(usually with low LA ester concentrations) for gasoline, petrochemical
diesel, and biodiesel, owing to their advantages such as low toxicity,
stable flash point, excellent lubricity, and good low-temperature
fluidity.13,14

Butyl levulinate (BL), as a kind of
LA ester, has been widely applied
in food and chemical industries. At present, there are three methods
for the synthesis of BL. The first is direct esterification of LA
with n-butanol. Dharne et al.15 synthesized BL by esterification of LA and n-butanol with a heteropoly acid catalyst. The conversion rate could
reach 97%. Maheria et al.16 developed acidic
zeolites for synthesizing BL through esterification of lignocellulose-derived
LA and n-butanol. Direct conversion of LA has the
advantages of simple process, high conversion rate, and high purity
of the BL product. However, most of previous studies merely focus
on the process of the conversion of various types of feedstocks to
LA.17,18 Only a few studies have reported the separation
and purification processes of extraction,19,20 electrodialysis,21 and direct distillation22 to obtain LA from the hydrolysate. Considering
the cost and effect of separation, extraction is the most widely studied
process with complex techniques, including cellulose-hydrolysis, concentration,
extraction, back-extraction, and vacuum distillation operation. These
complex processes result in considerable cost in extracting LA. Besides,
the addition of an extractant in the extraction process brings other
impurities, which is not conducive for product separation and purification.
The second method is furfuryl alcohol conversion. Furfuryl alcohol
can produce LA esters by heating alcoholysis with an acidic catalyst.
Chang et al.23 converted the furfuryl alcohol
to BL in n-butanol with ferric sulfate as the catalyst
with the yield of BL up to 86.7%. Mohammadbagheri et al.24 obtained BL from the furfuryl alcohol alcoholysis
in n-butanol with KCC-1/Pr-SO3H as the
catalyst. An yield of BL as high as 81.9% was achieved with some side
reactions. Besides, the reaction conditions and the catalyst have
a great influence on the yield of the product. However, as the raw
material for BL production, furfuryl alcohol is also an important
platform chemical, which needs to be converted from hemicellulose
in the biomass. Hence, high prices of raw material limit BL production
on a large scale. The third method refers to the synthesis of BL by
adding biomass raw materials, alcohols, and catalysts to the reactor
simultaneously for one-step alcoholysis–esterification under
high temperature conditions. Deng et al.25 adopted the alcoholysis of cellulose in n-butanol
to synthesize BL catalyzed by metal sulfate. Hishikawa et al.26 studied the direct synthesis of BL from cellulose
catalyzed by a sulfuric acid catalyst in butanol. This method has
various advantages such as simple process, wide source of raw materials,
low cost, short reaction route, and easy control of process conditions.
However, the disadvantages of this method are the formation of more
byproducts and a complex separation process in the later stage. At
present, there is no suitable industrial production process for preparing
BL from low cost raw materials. A completely new process method with
low cost and wide source of raw materials, high product purity, and
capability for large-scale production is therefore required.

In this paper, cellulose is used as a raw material to study the
new process of producing BL through direct acid hydrolysis. The final
product BL is chosen as the extractant to avoid introducing other
impurities. Unit operations including fed-batch hydrolysis, decolorization,
and extraction in the whole process are discussed, whereas optimal
conditions for each unit operation are given. The recycling of materials
in the process is further optimized, allowing for reduced energy consumption
and waste emission.

2.2 Experimental
Procedure
The experimental
process is shown in Figure 1. Note that to avoid the introduction of other organic impurities,
the crude product BL was selected as the extractant and was recycled
for extraction operation after the esterification reaction. Process
system engineering was applied in this process, as most of the materials
were recycled.

Figure 1 Overview of the experimental process.

2.2.1 Fed-Batch Hydrolysis
The experiment
was carried out in a 500 mL reaction vessel. The inner wall of the
reactor, which was contacted with raw materials, was made of Hastelloy
(C276) for preventing corrosion under acidic conditions. Cellulose
(45 g) and 300 mL of 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid solution were placed
into the reaction vessel. The reaction was maintained at 453.15 K
for 50 min, and the vessel impeller speed was set to 400 rpm. The
reaction under the above conditions could ensure that the cellulose
was fully converted.27 After the reaction,
the filter residue was separated and the volume of the filtrate was
measured. The same volume of 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid solution as the
hydrolysate adsorbed by the residue was added for washing. Later,
the washing solution was added into the filtrate to recover the reaction
solution to 300 mL for the next hydrolysis reaction. The reaction
was continued to hydrolyze new batches of cellulose by adding the
recovered hydrolysate from the previous step while maintaining the
same solid–liquid ratio. The reaction conditions were kept
the same as those for the first hydrolysis step to ensure that the
cellulose would be completely converted. This process was referred
to as the second batch hydrolysis. Based on this method, the hydrolysate
was continuously adopted to hydrolyze the cellulose.

2.2.2 Decolorization by Resin and Resin Regeneration
For
this, 15 g of AB-8 macroporous adsorption wet resin was placed
in a glass column. Then, 75 mL of the hydrolysate (solid–liquid
ratio is 1:5) was pumped into the column with a flow rate of 1 BV/h
at room temperature, and the effluent was collected. The hydrolysate
before and after decolorization was diluted 25 times, respectively.
Then, the absorbance of the hydrolysate before and after decolorization
was measured by a spectrophotometer (V-5100B, YuanXi Instrument Analysis
Co., Ltd., Shanghai) at the wavelength of 420 nm. The aforementioned
decolorization experiment was repeated thereafter by switching the
solid–liquid ratio to 1:10, 1:15, and 1:20, respectively, and
the absorbance of hydrolysates was measured. After decolorization,
the resin was eluted with 15 mL of 333.15 K hot water for removing
the LA and formic acid adsorbed on the resin. The eluent was mixed
with the hydrolysate for subsequent operations, and the used resins
were regenerated. For resin regeneration, the used resin was added
into 30 mL of ethanol and placed in a magnetic stirrer at 333.15 K
stirring for 30 min. To completely regenerate the resin, the resin
was separated from ethanol by a sand core funnel and then was added
into 30 mL of fresh ethanol to repeat the above operation. Finally,
the regenerated resin was fully washed with deionized water to remove
ethanol and used for the next decolorization. The used ethanol was
distilled and collected for recycling. The remaining solid humins
after evaporation of ethanol were mixed with the residue of the feed-hydrolysis
reaction for preparing activated carbon raw materials.

2.2.3 Decolorization by Activated Carbon
For further decolorization,
50 mL of the hydrolysate obtained from
resin decolorization was mixed with 0.25 g of activated carbon and
placed in a magnetic stirred vessel at the temperature of 333.15 K
(the best decolorization performance of activated carbon was found
experimentally at a temperature of 333.15 K) and stirred for 30 min.
After decolorization, the mixture was filtered through a 0.45 μm
filter to obtain the clear hydrolysate and the used activated carbon.
The absorbance of the hydrolysate after decolorization was measured.
The above experiment was repeated by changing the amount of activated
carbon to 0.125 and 0.375 g with the resin decolorized hydrolysate,
respectively (while keeping the solid–liquid ratio of the resin
and hydrolysate at 1:15). The used activated carbon was mixed with
the residue for producing microporous activated carbon.

2.2.4 Extraction Operation
For this,
200 mL of the final product butyl levulinate and 200 mL of the decolorized
hydrolysate were thoroughly mixed for 30 min. After shaking, the solution
was poured into a 1000 mL separatory funnel and allowed to stand for
15 min. The upper extractant and the lower raffinate were separately
discharged and collected. A large amount of LA retained in the raffinate
solution was collected and used as the solvent for the hydrolysis
process. The extractant was reserved for the subsequent step operation.

2.2.5 Esterification Reaction
The extractant
including LA was flashed under 373.15 K to distill water and formic
acid. After flash evaporation, excess n-butanol and
0.5 mL of sulfuric acid (served as the catalyst) were added into the
extractant. The reaction was heated in an oil bath heating apparatus
and was carried out under the following conditions: the reaction temperature
was maintained at 373.15 K; the nitrogen gas rate was controlled to
100 mL/min; the stirring speed was set to 100 rpm. Nitrogen was adopted
to bring the water–n-butanol azeotrope into
the condenser. Then, the water–n-butanol azeotrope
was cooled back to the lower storage tube in the condenser and stratified.
As the reaction progresses, the liquid level in the storage tube rises
up continuously, whilst the upper layer of n-butanol
can be returned from the liquid storage tube to the flask to participate
in the reaction. The lower layer of water can be discharged through
the valve, ensuring that the esterification reaction continues. The
reaction was conducted for 3 h until no more water was evaporated.
The evaporated water in the esterification reaction could be recycled
to the hydrolysis operation as new solvent.

2.2.6 Purification
of Butyl Levulinate
After the esterification reaction, the
solution mainly contains butyl
levulinate, unreacted n-butanol, sulfuric acid catalyst,
soluble humins, and humin esters. To obtain pure butyl levulinate,
further refining of the solution is required. The solution was first
distilled to remove the unreacted n-butanol at a
temperature of 403.15 K. Part of the crude product, i.e., BL, was
used as the extractant to circulate to the extraction process. The
remaining crude ester solution was washed successively with saturated
sodium carbonate solution and water to remove the sulfuric acid and
salt, respectively. The crude ester solution after washing was distilled
at an absolute pressure of 0.02 MPa and a temperature of 413.15 K
to obtain a transparent BL product.

2.3 Analytical
Method
The absorbance
of the hydrolysate was measured by a spectrophotometer (Jingke V-5100B,
Shanghai, China) at a wavelength of 420 nm.

The decolorization
rate E can be expressed as 1  where A0 denotes
the absorbance of the hydrolysate and A is the absorbance
of the hydrolysate after decolorization.

Gas chromatography
(Shimadzu) with a FFAP (30 m × 0.32 mm
× 0.33 μm) capillary column was used to determine the content
of LA and BL in the sample. N2 (High purity, 99.99%) was
used as the carrier, and the flow rate of the carrier was selected
as 15 mL/min. Ethyl benzoate was used as the internal standard. The
initial temperature of the oven was set to 363.15 K and was maintained
at this temperature for 3 min. Then, the column oven was heated at
a rate of 10 K/min and the sample was separated in the temperature
programming process. After the temperature reached 503.15 K, the process
was maintained at this temperature for 2 min. The temperature of the
sampler was 513.15 K, and the temperature of the detector was 523.15
K. A standard curve was plotted by using the chromatographic pure
chemical. The concentration of each component in the samples was measured
thereafter by standard curves.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Study of the Fed-Batch
Hydrolysis
The traditional hydrolysis process yields low
concentrations of levulinic
acid, which is not conducive with respect to LA separation. In our
previous study,28 a new fed-batch hydrolysis
process for increasing the concentration of LA in the hydrolysate
was developed. This new fed-batch hydrolysis process was adopted in
this work. As shown in Figure 2, the concentration of the LA increased with the number of
hydrolysis batches. A 171.63 g/L concentration of the LA was obtained
at the fifth feeding, which effectively reduces the amount of acid
catalyst used in the hydrolysis. As a result, the fed-batch hydrolysis
can effectively reduce the energy consumption for the subsequent separation
and purification processes in industrial production. However, with
increasing feeding time, the increment of the LA concentration exhibited
a gradual moderate decline with a greater decline for the fifth feeding.
In particular, the concentration increment was only 15.98 g/L at the
fifth feeding, compared to that of 27.84 g/L at the fourth feeding.
Since the yield of LA decreased significantly between the fourth and
fifth feedings, a four times hydrolysis feeding is considered to be
reasonable, as it not only obtains relatively high concentrations
of levulinic acid but also effectively reduces the operating costs.

of the LA concentration with feeding times of the hydrolysis.

3.2 Effect
of Resin Content on Decolorization
of the Hydrolysate
The cellulose hydrolysate contains a large
amount of red-brown soluble humins.29,30 As shown in Figure 3, extraction of the
hydrolysate without decolorization causes serious pollution on the
extractant (upper layer solution). In addition, soluble humins extracted
by the extractant may react with n-butanol to form
humin esters. Consequently, n-butanol is excessively
consumed and byproducts humin esters are not conducive to the separation
and purification of butyl levulinate. Therefore, it is necessary to
decolorize the hydrolysate before extraction to remove the soluble
humin impurities.

Figure 3 Comparison of hydrolysate extraction with and without
decolorization:
(1) the original hydrolysate; (2) the extracted sample without decolorization;
(3) the extracted sample with decolorization (in samples 2 and 3,
the upper layer is the extractant and the lower layer is the raffinate).

Due to the weak adsorption of
short-chain organic acids on macroporous
adsorption resin, the adsorption capacity of organic acids is generally
low. Nevertheless, soluble humins have large molecular weight, the
molecular structure of which includes a double bond, benzene ring,
and furan ring. These functional groups render the large affinity
of soluble humins to macroporous adsorption resin, resulting in the
high adsorption capacity of soluble humins on the resin. As a kind
of weak polar macroporous adsorption resin, AB-8 resins have strong
adsorption capacity on soluble humins. Moreover, adsorbed soluble
humins are more difficult to be eluted from AB-8 resin as compared
to levulinic acid. Therefore, AB-8 macroporous adsorption resin was
selected to decolorize the hydrolysate.

The amount of AB-8 adsorbent
has a direct effect on the decolorization
rate. As shown in Table 2, when the solid–liquid ratios (the ratio of AB-8 resin to
hydrolysate) are 1:5, 1:10, 1:15, and 1:20, the corresponding decolorization
rates are 82.6, 78.6, 71.2, and 60.7%, respectively. The decolorization
rate of the hydrolysate increases with increased amounts of resin.
When the solid–liquid ratio increased from 1:10 to 1:5, the
decolorization effect of the hydrolysate was not significantly improved.
The reason may be due to the variation in the molecular weight of
soluble humins in the hydrolysate. Macroporous resin has an obvious
adsorption effect on soluble humins with relatively large molecular
weight, rather than that on soluble humins with small molecular weight.

Table 2 Relationship between Different Solid–Liquid
Ratios of Resin and the Decolorization Rate
hydrolysate
(mL)	amount of
resin (g)	solid–liquid ratio (g:mL)	decolorization
rate (%)	
75	15	1:5	82.6	
150	15	1:10	78.6	
225	15	1:15	71.2	
300	15	1:20	60.7	
In view of the small molecular weight of the remaining
soluble
humins, activated carbon with small pore size was selected to further
decolorize the hydrolysate. The hydrolysate after resin decolorization
with a solid–liquid ratio of 1:15 was employed as the decolorizing
solution. Then, different doses of activated carbon were selected
for the secondary decolorization. The results are shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Relationship between Different Solid–Liquid
Ratios of Activated Carbon and the Secondary Decolorization Rate
hydrolysate
after resin decolorization (mL)	amount of
activated carbon (g)	solid–liquid ratio of secondary decolorization (g:mL)	secondary
decolorization rate (%)	accumulative
decolorization rate (%)	
50	0.125	1:400	36.1	81.6	
50	0.25	1:200	62.7	89.0	
50	0.375	1:133	75.5	92.9	
From Table 3, the
decolorization rate of the hydrolysate improves with increasing the
amount of activated carbon. However, when the amount of activated
carbon increased further to 0.375 g, the improvement in the decolorization
rate (3.9%) was lower as compared to the former step change (7.4%).
This may be attributed to the fact that most majority of soluble humins
have been adsorbed by activated carbon at the solid–liquid
ratio of 1:200, while more activated carbon added into the hydrolysate
would not be an obvious benefit for the decolorization. Therefore,
a 1:200 solid–liquid ratio was selected as the optimal condition
for the secondary decolorization of the hydrolysate.

To evaluate
the combined decolorization of resin and activated
carbon on soluble humins, three different amounts of macroporous resins,
i.e., solid–liquid ratios of 1:10, 1:15, and 1:20, were selected
to decolorize the hydrolysates, respectively. After resin decolorization,
the hydrolysates were further decolorized by identical amounts of
activated carbon (0.25 g, solid–liquid ratio is 1:200). The
results detailed in Table 3 show that the secondary decolorization rate reduces with
a decreasing amount of resin added for the first decolorization. This
may be attributed to larger amounts of soluble humins with large molecular
weight remaining in the hydrolysate when lower amounts of resins were
used in first decolorization. During the secondary decolorization,
partial pore channels of the activated carbon were likely occupied
by those large macromolecular humins, and thus soluble humins with
small molecule weights have less opportunity to get into the micropore
structure of the activated carbon, resulting in a relatively low secondary
decolorization rate of the hydrolysate.

As shown in Table 4 and Figure 4, when
the ratio of macroporous resin to hydrolysate is 1:15 and the ratio
of activated carbon to hydrolysate is 1:200, a good decolorization
effect can be obtained, which not only removes most of the soluble
humins in the solution but also reduces the amount of activated carbon
and resin.

samples before extraction: (1) the original hydrolysate without decolorization;
(2) the hydrolysate with resin decolorization; and (3) the hydrolysate
with resin and activated carbon decolorization. The ratio of macroporous
resin to hydrolysate is 1:15, and the ratio of activated carbon to
hydrolysate is 1:200.

3.3 Recycling of the Resin
To recycle
the resin after decolorization, the resin regeneration process is
needed. The resin regeneration process can be referred to Section 2.2.2. The decolorization
rate is adopted to represent the decolorization efficiency of the
regenerated resin. As shown in Figure 5, the decolorization rate decreased slightly with increasing
the times of regenerated resin usage. In particular, a 68.6% decolorization
rate of the hydrolysate can be reached at the seventh use of resin,
a bit lower than that of the hydrolysate at the first time (71.4%),
indicating that resins still have good decolorization efficiency on
hydrolysate after the seventh usage.

Figure 5 Relationship between times of resin usage
and the decolorization
rate of the hydrolysate. The solid–liquid ratio of the hydrolysate
and resins is given as 1:15.

3.4 Extractant Selection
After decolorization,
the LA needs to be extracted from the hydrolysate to the extractant.
A large variety of physical solvents have been mentioned for organic
acid extraction such as ketones, fatty acids, alcohols, ethers, and
halogenated hydrocarbons.30 In addition,
aliphatic amines,31 organophosphorus,32 and compound extractants19,20 have been used to extract carboxylic acids with high efficiency.
However, for LA extraction, all aforementioned extractants are acting
as impurities, which give rise to extra difficulties for the subsequent
extractant separation from final products. Based on this, the final
product BL was chosen as the extractant, due to its specific characteristics
such as low solubility in water, safety in use, chemically stable,
and especially no extra impurities introduced during the extraction
process.

The extraction effects of different amounts of the
extractant were investigated, as shown in Table 5. When the ratio of the extractant to the
hydrolysate was 1:1, the extraction rate of LA was 44.8%, and the
concentration of LA in the extractant was 63.2 g/L. Upon increasing
the amount of extractant added, the extraction rate of LA increases,
whereas the concentration of LA in the extractant reduces. When the
amount of extractant increases to 2:1, the extraction rate reached
61.8%, while the concentration of LA in the extractant was 44.27 g/L.
Considering the concentration in the extractant and the extraction
rate of levulinic acid, a reasonable ratio of the extractant to the
hydrolysate is given as 1.5:1.

3.5 Development of the Whole Esterification Process
A detailed process flow chart of the BL production from cellulose
is presented in Figure 6. First, the cellulose was hydrolyzed with the fed-batch hydrolysis
process to obtain a high concentration of LA up to 155 g/L. Second,
the LA hydrolysate was decolorized by both resin and activated carbon
to remove the soluble humins, and the accumulative decolorization
rate reached 89%. After decolorization, the final product BL, as the
extractant, was added to the hydrolysate for extracting LA from the
hydrolysate. Then, excess n-butanol was added to
the flashed extractant for the esterification reaction. By continuously
steaming the byproduct water out of the reactor during esterification,
a conversion rate of LA as high as 99.5% was achieved. Finally, the
product BL was obtained with a purity of 98 wt % after dealcoholization
and purification.

Figure 6 Process flow chart of the BL production from cellulose:
(1) fed-batch
hydrolysis; (2) decolorization; (3) extraction; (4) esterification;
and (5) purification.

In the proposed new process, BL was directly synthesized
from cellulose.
Raw materials can be acquired from cellulose-rich biomass that is
widely available, avoiding the use of expensive LA or furfuryl alcohol.
High concentrations of the LA hydrolysate through the fed-batch hydrolysis
were obtained, thereby reducing energy consumption as compared to
ordinary processes with low concentrations of levulinic acid. To remove
soluble humins in the hydrolysate, a two-step decolorization method
was adopted, using resin-activated carbon, which reduces the burden
of the extractant in the extraction operation and avoids other impurities
of the esterification reaction. The AB-8 resin can be continuously
regenerated and the ethanol regenerant can be recycled in the regeneration
process. The activated carbon used in the decolorization process and
the distilled solid humins in the regeneration process could be mixed
into the hydrolysis residue for further use. In the extraction process,
the product BL was chosen as the extractant, avoiding the introduction
of other organic impurities. Using BL as the extractant can also avoid
separation of LA from the extractant with reducing the separation
energy consumption compared to the traditional process for preparing
the LA product first and then esterification. A large amount of LA
remained in the raffinate, and thus the raffinate can be recycled
to the next hydrolysis reaction. The distillate obtained from flash
distillation could also be put into the raffinate for the subsequent
hydrolysis. Dehydration in esterification can ensure a higher conversion
rate and unreacted n-butanol can be used for the
next esterification reaction. Overall, most of the materials, including
the BL product, can be continuously recycled while the waste residue
can be used to produce other chemical products such as microporous
activated carbon, saving cost and reducing emission. In this recycling
process, it is roughly estimated that 100 g of cellulose can produce
about 33 g (corresponding to 31 mol %) of BL product.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, a new process for the preparation
of BL from cellulose
was proposed. The process mainly includes unit operations such as
fed-batch hydrolysis, decolorization, extraction, esterification,
and purification. The fed-batch hydrolysis process can obtain a relatively
high LA concentration of 171.63 g/L at the fifth feeding. A two-step
decolorization method, i.e., decolorize by AB-8 resin and activated
carbon, respectively, was employed to remove soluble humins with an
accumulative decolorization rate of 89%. The final product BL was
chosen as the extractant to extract LA for the hydrolysate. After
esterification and purification, a high purity of 98 wt % was obtained
with a yield of BL around 31 mol %. During this process, most of the
materials including the final product BL were continuously recycled,
while the waste residue can be used to produce other chemical products
such as microporous activated carbon, allowing for cost-effective
preparation of BL by cellulose with reduced waste emission.
