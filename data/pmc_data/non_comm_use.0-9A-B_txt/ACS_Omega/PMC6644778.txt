A novel environmental
decalcifying agent was prepared with allylpolyethoxy
amino carboxylate (APEAA), hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), and maleic
anhydride (MA) by means of free-radical polymerization in an aqueous
solution. The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized
through scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra. The molecular-weight
distribution of APEAA–HEA–MA was determined by the gel
permeation chromatography method. APEAA–HEA–MA was used
as a green decalcifying agent to remove calcium from crude petroleum,
and the impact of factors such as monomer ratio, copolymerization
time, dosages, and desalination temperature was analyzed. It is found
that the decalcification rate of APEAA–HEA–MA could
reach to its maximum, and the calcium removal efficiency was approximately
97.88% when the monomer molar ratio of APEAA–HEA–MA
was 1:2:5, the reaction time of copolymerization was 2 h, the dosage
was 100 ppm, and the desalination temperature was 100 °C. This
research work can promote the exploration on facile synthesis of a
novel terpolymer and its potential application in refinery desalting
processes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
recent years, with the excessive exploitation of many oil fields,
crude petroleum tended to become more and more difficult to process
because of the increasing quantities of sour, acidic, and heavy crude
petroleum.1 These types of crude oils have
a comparatively high content of metal salts. Moreover, with the need
for deep processing of crude petroleum and hydrogenation, metals (such
as calcium and iron) in crude petroleum would cause particular problems
during the refinery process.2 The metal
compounds would be quickly deposited on the surface of the catalyst
during the catalytic cracking process of raw oil, resulting in catalyst
poisoning and losing its activity.3 Calcium
in crude petroleum generally exists in the form of calcium naphthenate,
calcium phenol, fatty acid calcium, and a handful of inorganic acid
calcium salts.4 Most water-soluble inorganic
metal salts can be separated from the feedstock by normal processes,
such as water washing and desalting, but oil-soluble organic calcium
compounds cannot be easily removed by these methods.5 Therefore, some additional processes are needed to remove
these compounds. Several techniques have been utilized for the removal
of calcium and iron from crude petroleum, such as the hydro-demetallization,6 the solvent extraction,7−9 the electrochemical
deposition method,10 and so forth. However,
these techniques require a high investment in the equipment needed
for the removal of calcium and iron.11 In
addition, the disposal of waste catalysts is also very expensive.
Thus, it would be desirable to remove these calcium compounds by adding
a decalcifying agent during the process of desalting pretreatment.

Until now, various chemical agents have been proposed for their
application in removing organic calcium, iron, and other metal compounds
in crude petroleum, such as carboxylic acids and carboxylic esters,
phosphoric acid and its salts, alkyl phosphate ester and its derivatives,
and so forth.12 However, these materials
have strongly corrosive and low-efficiency problems.13 Moreover, they would cause severe environmental pollution
problems. For example, phosphoester can generate insoluble phosphonate
complexes, and they can hydrolyze to yield orthophosphates resulting
in the formation of calcium–phosphate deposits in the presence
of excess calcium,14,15 and phosphorus is the main element
to the eutrophication of the water body.16 Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new environmentally green,
phosphate-free, and high-efficiency agent to remove the metal contaminants,
especially calcium and iron, from crude petroleum.

The copolymer
was developed in the late 1970s because it has a
strong multifunctional complexation and excellent polymolecular properties.17 There are some kinds of highly efficient and
low-corrosive polymers that have been used as decalcifying agents,
such as poly-glycolic esters and poly hydroxyl-carboxylic acids, during
the electro-desalting process in petroleum because of their controllable
pH range and different functional groups. Moreover, some of them can
be used as a scale inhibitor and a metallic corrosion inhibitor.18,19 However, when these polymers were used as a demetallization agent,
the required dosage was so large that it would increase the difficulty
scale of the treatment of the subsequent wastewater, and a large amount
of precipitation in the crude oil will also cause corrosion and scaling
of the processing equipment.20 Hence, it
is necessary to develop an environmentally friendly “green”
polymer which is amphipathic (hydrophilic and oleophilic) and contains
efficient functional groups.21,22

In this article,
the allylpolyethoxy amino carboxylate–2-hydroxyethyl
acrylate–maleic anhydride (APEAA–HEA–MA) terpolymer
was designed as a novel phosphorous-free decalcifying agent for removing
calcium from crude petroleum. The influence of reaction temperature,
reaction time, and the dosage of decalcifying agent on the decalcifying
efficiency was determined. The results demonstrated that the terpolymer
of APEAA–HEA–MA had successfully removed calcium from
crude petroleum as a highly efficient decalcifying agent.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fourier Transform Infrared
and Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Measurement
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra were taken for allyloxy polyethoxy ether (APEG) (a), APEAA
(b), and APEAA–HEA–MA (c), which are presented in Figure 1. It is shown that
the 1723 cm–1 strong intensity absorption peak (−C=O)
in curve b clearly reveals that APEAA has been synthesized successfully.23,24 The bands at 1646 cm–1 are from the stretching
of −C=C– groups [it can be seen in curves a and
b]. However, there are no peaks between 1620 and 1680 cm–1 in curve c, indicating that the free-radical polymerization among
APEAA, HEA, and MA has happened successfully.25

Figure 1 FT-IR
spectrums of APEG (a), APEAA (b), and APEAA–HEA–MA
(c).

The 1H NMR spectra
for APEG (a), APEAA (b), and APEAA–HEA–MA
(c,d) were exhibited in Figure 2. (CD3)2SO (δ = 2.53 ppm) was
used as the solvent for 1H NMR spectra (a–c), and
D2O (δ = 4.80 ppm) was used as the solvent for 1H NMR spectra (d). The protons of characteristic groups such
as propenyl protons (CH2=CH–CH2–, δ = 3.88–4.01 ppm), active hydrogen in APEG
(−OH, δ = 4.40–4.60 ppm), and ether groups (−OCH2CH2–, δ = 3.10–3.90 ppm) for
APEG, APEAA, and APEAA–HEA–MA were different from each
other. APEG (Figure 4a): δ = 2.53 ppm (solvent residual peak of (CD3)2SO), δ = 3.44, 3.45, 3.54 ppm (−OCH2CH2–, ether groups), δ = 3.98 ppm (CH2=CH–CH2–, propenyl protons),
δ = 4.55 ppm (−OH, active hydrogen). APEAA (Figure 4b): δ = 2.53
ppm (solvent residual peak of (CD3)2SO), δ
= 3.44, 3.54 ppm (−OCH2CH2–, ether
groups), δ = 3.97 ppm (CH2=CH–CH2–, propenyl protons). APEAA–HEA–MA (Figure 4c): δ = 2.53
ppm (solvent residual peak of (CD3)2SO), δ
= 3.31 ppm (−OCH2CH2–, ether groups),
δ = 4.41, 4.50 ppm (−OH, active hydrogen). APEAA–HEA–MA
(Figure 4d): δ
= 2.50 ppm (−CH2–CH–, methylene protons),
δ = 3.37 ppm (−OCH2CH2–,
ether groups), δ = 4.50 ppm (−OH, active hydrogen), δ
= 4.80 ppm (solvent residual peak of D2O).2613C NMR (Figure S3, (CD3)2SO, 600 MHz): δ 194.92, 167.20,
166.39, 165.47, 164.79, 135.25, 134.41, 132.84, 128.76, 72.81, 71.75,
70.26, 70.05, 69.80, 68.53, 65.43, 64.69, 60.70, 58.51, 40.16, 40.02,
39.88 ppm.

Figure 2 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra
of APEG (a), APEAA (b), and APEAA–HEA–MA (c,d).

Compared with Figure 2a, the disappeared peak at
δ = 4.55 ppm (−OH, active
hydrogen) in Figure 2b indicates that the active hydroxyl group of APEG has reacted with l-aspartic acid (Figure S1),27,28 which confirms the FT-IR analysis of emerging 1723 cm–1 strong intensity absorption peak (−C=O) in Figure 2b. Moreover, the
double-bond absorption peaks at δ = 3.97 ppm (CH2=CH–CH2–, propenyl protons) in Figure 2b completely disappeared
in Figure 2c because
of the free-radical polymerization among APEAA, HEA, and MA. From
the analysis of FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra, it can be concluded
that the structure of synthesized APEAA–HEA–MA satisfied
the expected requirements.

2.2 Morphology of the Terpolymer
Figure 3 showed
the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (a,b) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (c,d) images of the APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer. It
can be seen from the images that the morphology of the terpolymer
was catenulate with twig. The structure resembling the crab’s
pincers makes it easy for APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer to
contact with the compound organic calcium (calcium naphthenate, phenyl-calcium,
etc.) and form amphipathic (hydrophilic and oleophilic) chelate between
APEAA–HEA–MA and calcium ions.29

(a,b) and TEM (c,d) images of APEAA–HEA–MA.

2.3 Molecular-Weight Determinations
by GPC
Figure 4 displayed the molecular-weight distribution
of APEAA
and APEAA–HEA–MA. As can be seen, the curve of response
to retention time is unimodal, and the molecular weight shows the
infinitely uniform distribution.30 According
to the analysis of GPC information, the number-average molecular weight
(Mn) and the weight-average molecular
weight (Mw) of APEAA are 1140 and 1942,
respectively, and for APEAA–HEA–MA, the number-average
molecular weight (Mn) and the weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) are 2687 and 4026,
respectively, and the polydispersity index (PID, Mw/Mn) of APEAA and APEAA–HEA–MA
are 1.7035 and 1.4983, respectively. In addition, the molecular weight
and the molecular-weight distribution would be influenced by the reaction
time of copolymerization and would impact the calcium removal ability.
The molecular mass and the molecular-weight distribution were determined
by GPC (Table 1). It
can be found that the average molecular weight changes with the reaction
time of copolymerization. Regarding the molecular weight, too low
or too high molecular weight might have a negative impact on the decalcifying
performance, which could be attributed to the low-molecular-weight
samples containing less effective groups, whereas the high-molecular-weight
samples might wrap the active groups inside the molecular chains.
Moreover, the relatively broad molecular weight distribution could
influence the stability of the APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer
and thus reduce its decalcifying properties. Therefore, the terpolymer
with an appropriate intermediate molecular weight and a narrower molecular-weight
distribution might perform better for calcium removal.

2.4 Effect
of Molar Ratio of APEAA–HEA–MA
on Decalcification Efficiency
Figure 5a demonstrates the decalcification efficiency
of APEAA–HEA–MA with different monomer molar ratios
(dosage: 100 ppm; desalination temperature: 100 °C), and the
calcium content of the crude petroleum after electric desalting and
the electric desalting water is exhibited in Figure 5b. The conversion rate, ratio of functional
groups, and the sequence structure of the polymer will all be variable
because of the different molar ratios. Only when the proportion of
the functional groups are appropriate, the polymers would have a good
performance of removing calcium from crude petroleum because the different
compounds and structures of the polymers obviously have an influence
on the gravitation and repulsion to particles. As can be seen from
the data exhibited in Figure 5a, the molar ratio of APEAA–HEA–MA had an influence
on the decalcification of APEAA–HEA–MA, and when the
molar ratio of APEAA–HEA–MA was 1:2:5, the APEAA–HEA–MA
terpolymer exhibited a superior calcium removal efficiency; hence,
we decided to choose a monomer molar ratio of 1:2:5 for the further
research.

Figure 5 (a) Influence of molar ratio of APEAA–HEA–MA on decalcification
efficiency, and (b) calcium material balance after electric desalting.

2.5 Influence
of Copolymerization Time of APEAA–HEA–MA
on Decalcification Efficiency
The experiments were to study
the patterns of how copolymerization time affected the calcium removal
efficiency when taking APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) as a decalcifying
agent (dosage: 100 ppm and desalination temperature: 100 °C),
and the results are shown in Figure 6. It can be found that the removal efficiency of calcium
for APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) is 55.29% when the copolymerization
time is 0.5 h. As can be seen, the removal efficiency of calcium for
the APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) terpolymer increases to 97.88%
when the copolymerization time is increased up to 2 h. This result
may attribute to that the increase of copolymerization time could
make the terpolymer proportions of the functional groups in long-chain
macromolecules appropriate and enhance its decalcifying property.
However, the APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) sample exhibited a
significant decrease in calcium removal efficiency when the copolymerization
time rises from 2 to 3 h. Therefore, the different reaction times
of copolymerization could cause the different extents of reaction
and degree of polymerization of the APEAA–HEA–MA, and
these results illustrated that the terpolymer of APEAA–HEA–MA
displayed the best efficacy of decalcification from the crude petroleum
with 2.0 h of the copolymerization time.

Figure 6 (a) Effect of reaction
time of copolymerization on the calcium
removal efficiency, and (b) calcium material balance after electric
desalting.

2.6 Effect
of Dosage of APEAA–HEA–MA
on Decalcification Efficiency
Figure 7a exhibited the data of decalcification efficiency
with adding several dosages of APEG, APEAA, and APEAA–HEA–MA
under 100 °C, and the calcium material balance for APEAA–HEA–MA
(1:2:5) after electric desalting was displayed in Figure 7b. The decalcification effectiveness
was only 11.48% without adding any chemical additive to crude petroleum.
However, when the terpolymer APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) was
added into the oil, the decalcification could be increased quite significantly,
achieving 97.88% when the dosage of APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5)
was up to 100 ppm. Comparatively, APEG and APEAA could only approach
20.01 and 25.38%, respectively, under the same condition. Because
APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) contains more carboxyl (−COOH),
amino (−NH2), and ester groups (−COO−)
and the synergistic effect between them, the terpolymer shows the
best calcium removal efficiency.1,31 However, the decalcification
effectiveness does not obviously increase correspondingly when the
concentration of APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) exceeds 100 ppm.
Comparatively, the APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer performs
extremely effectively in calcium removal and lowers the calcium content
by using a small dosage during desalting to render a higher-quality
crude oil.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of dosage of APEG, APEAA, and APEAA–HEA–MA
on the decalcification efficiency, and (b) calcium material balance
for APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5) after electric desalting.

2.7 Influence
of Desalination Temperature on Decalcification
Efficiency
The results of using APEAA–HEA–MA
(1:2:5) as a decalcifying agent (dosage: 100 ppm) under different
desalination temperatures are presented in Figure 8a, and the calcium content in electric desalting
water and crude petroleum after electro-desalting is shown in Figure 8b. It can be seen
from the data that the decalcification rate of APEAA–HEA–MA
(1:2:5) is 44.18% when the desalination temperature is 60 °C.
However, the removal efficiency of calcium for the terpolymer of APEAA–HEA–MA
increased to 97.88% when the temperature reached 100 °C. This
phenomenon can be ascribed to the higher temperature and could give
the terpolymer enough energy to make the functional groups more active
and raise its decalcifying ability. However, when the temperature
was risen from 120 to 180 °C, there was an obvious decrease in
the calcium removal efficiency for the APEAA–HEA–MA
terpolymer. When the temperature is at that high, the water evaporation
is much faster than droplet coalescence, and the hydrosoluble calcium
compounds could barely separate from the crude petroleum into the
desalting water. As can be seen, the optimum temperature was 100 °C,
and the decalcification efficiency could reach up to 97.88%.

of desalination temperature on decalcification rate,
and (b) calcium material balance for APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5)
after electric desalting.

2.8 Comparison with Other Polymers
The
decalcification property of the APEAA–HEA–MA (1:2:5)
terpolymer was compared with several commercial phosphorous-free polymers
under the desalination temperature of 100 °C, and the data are
shown in Figure 9.
As can be seen from Figure 9, the decalcifying ability followed the order of APEAA–HEA–MA
> hydrolyzed polymaleic acid (HPMA) > polyacrylic acid (PAA)
> polyepoxysuccinic
acid (PESA). In particular, the decalcification rate of the APEAA–HEA–MA
(1:2:5) terpolymer could reach 97.88% at the dosage of 100 ppm, whereas
PAA, HPMA, and PESA could only reach 26.86, 31.28, and 20.09%, respectively.
Furthermore, when the volume of addition for APEAA–HEA–MA
(1:2:5) exceeded 100 ppm, the decalcification rate remains basically
unchanged with the increase of dosage. However, HPMA, PAA, and PESA
also exhibit a relatively excellent calcium removal property from
crude petroleum, with 66.83, 59.92, and 54.27% at a dosage of 250
ppm, respectively. Even more, PESA performs better decalcification
property than both HPMA and PAA when the dosage exceeded 300 ppm.
The superior effectiveness exhibited by APEAA–HEA–MA
terpolymer is provided by the presence of amino (−NH2), carboxyl (−COOH), and ester groups as active sites and
their synergistic effect. The terpolymer of APEAA–HEA–MA
(1:2:5) performs extremely better on the calcium removal capability
compared to other chemical additives, such as HPMA, PAA, and PESA.
In addition, the cost of decalcification agents is also an important
factor affecting its application, and the cost of APEAA–HEA–MA
was contrasted with other typical polymers of PAA, HPMA, and PESA.
As shown in Table 2, it can be found that the cost of APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer
is a little bit higher than that of other polymers. However, the dosage
of APEAA–HEA–MA is much less than that of other polymers
in practical application because of its excellent decalcification
performance. Therefore, the APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer
would have a relative lower cost, and it might produce higher economic
benefit as a potential decalcifying agent of crude oil.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the APEAA–HEA–MA
terpolymer had an excellent
performance on the removal of calcium from crude oil with a low reagent/oil
mass ratio. The effect of reaction conditions on the decalcification
performance was studied systematically. Briefly, the terpolymer had
an excellent decalcification performance when the proportion of functional
groups are carefully designed and adjusted, which has been ascribed
to the different functional groups and structures of the terpolymer
that could influence on the gravitation and repulsion to particles.
The different molecular weights and molecular-weight distributions
determined by the copolymerization time influence the solubility and
stability of the terpolymer and therefore its decalcification performance.
An increase in the desalination temperature could make the functional
groups more active and so increase its decalcifying ability. However,
further increases above 120 °C would restrain water droplets
to coalesce, and the hydrosoluble calcium compounds could barely separate
from the crude petroleum rapidly enough. Therefore, appropriate molar
ratio, molecular weight, dosage, and desalination temperature are
key parameters for reaching the maximum decalcification rate at the
minimum cost. At last, when the APEAA–HEA–MA terpolymer
was used as a reagent and the reaction conditions were at the monomer
molar ratio (APEAA–HEA–MA) of 1:2:5, the copolymerization
reaction time of 2.0 h, the dosage of 100 ppm, and the desalination
temperature of 100 °C, the decalcification rate could reach 97.88%.
Compared with other nonphosphorus polymers such as HPMA, PAA, and
PESA, APEAA–HEA–MA containing more amino, carboxyl,
and ester groups displays the best calcium removal ability from crude
petroleum. On the basis of the above results, APEAA–HEA–MA
is an efficient decalcifying agent for crude petroleum.

4.1 Materials
APEG
(Mw = 400 g·mol–1), l-aspartic
acid (Mw = 133.10 g·mol–1), 2-HEA (Mw = 116.12 g·mol–1), MA (Mw = 98.06 g·mol–1), and ammonium persulfate (APS, Mw = 228.201 g·mol–1) were analytically
of pure grades and purchased from Aladdin Chemical Regent Co., Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). PAA (Mw = 1800 g·mol–1), HPMA (Mw = 600 g·mol–1), and PESA (Mw = 1000
g·mol–1) were of technical grade and supplied
by Jiangsu Jianghai Chemical Co., Ltd. (Changzhou, Jiangsu, P. R.
China). Distilled water was used for all the studies.

4.2 Preparation of APEAA
As shown in Figure 10, the esterification
of the surface hydroxyl groups of APEG was realized with l-aspartic acid according to our previous works.32,33 Typically, 0.1 mol of l-aspartic acid was dissolved into
30 mL of water (pH = 3), and the above l-aspartic acid solution
was loaded into a three-necked flask, which was placed in the microwave
reactor (MCR-3, 900 W). Then, 0.1 mol of APEG was added into the l-aspartic acid solution. Subsequently, the temperature was
set to 90 °C and kept at this temperature for 10 min. After cooling
to room temperature, the sample of APEAA was obtained.

Figure 10 Preparation
of APEAA.

4.3 Preparation
of APEAA–HEA–MA
The synthetic process was as
follows: 0.01 mol of APEAA was dissolved
into 35 mL of water in a 250 mL four-neck round-bottom flask, equipped
with a thermometer and a magnetic stirrer. The solution was heated
to 75 °C with stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently,
solution A including 0.02 mol of HEA, 0.05 mol of MA, and 18 mL of
distilled water (the molar ratio of APEAA, HEA, and MA was 1:2:5)
and solution B obtained by adding 3.98 g of APS into 18 mL of distilled
water were added into the APEAA solution separately at constant flow
rates over a period of 2.0 h. The reactant mixture was then heated
to 85 °C and maintained at this temperature for another 2.0 h.
After cooling to room temperature, an aqueous polymer solution containing
approximately 26.8% solid was gained. The solid product of APEAA–HEA–MA
could be obtained through purification using acetone. The APEAA–HEA–MA
solution, used as a decalcifying agent, is of slight odor, orange
in color, and a nonphosphorous liquid. It was an environmentally friendly
product that it would not cause pollution to the air or water. The
preparation procedure of APEAA–HEA–MA is shown in Figure 11.

Figure 11 Preparation of APEAA–HEA–MA.

4.4 Sample
Characterizations
The samples
were analyzed with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (VECTOR-22,
Bruker Co., Germany) in the region of 4000–500 cm–1. The samples were dried under vacuum until reaching to a constant
weight before the measurement. The dried samples were researched into
the powder, mixed with KBr powder, and then compressed to make a pellet
for FT-IR characterization. The structures of APEG, APEAA, and APEAA–HEA–MA
were also explored by a Bruker NMR analyzer (AVANCE AV-500, Bruker,
Switzerland) operating at 500 MHz. The molecular weight was determined
by GPC (Shodex KF-850 column) calibrated using polyethylene glycol
standards ranging in molecular weight from 1.32 × 102 to 1.34 × 106 g·mol–1. Water
with NaNO3 (0.125 mol·L–1) was used
as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.00 mL·min–1. The morphology and structure of APEAA–HEA–MA were
characterized with a scanning electron microscope (FEI Inspect F50)
and a transmission electron microscope (FEI G2 20). The calcium content
of the oil samples were evaluated by means of an inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Elemental X7 Series).

4.5 Procedure of Removing Calcium from Crude Petroleum
Removal of calcium compounds from crude petroleum was carried out
in a DPY-2 electric desalter instrument. The pipeline oil sample (40
g, the properties such as density, viscosity, and calcium content
are shown in Table 3, which were supplied by Sinopec Group) was placed in a constant
temperature bath for about 30 min. Then, 3 mL of distilled water and
a certain dose of demulsifier were added into the oil sample and stirred
for 2 min at a high stirring rate (about 2000 rpm) and then the mixed
crude petroleum was transferred into a sample bottle which equipped
with electrodes. Subsequently, the desired dose of the APEAA–HEA–MA
terpolymer was added into the sample bottle, fixed in the electronic
oscillator, and vibrated for 200 times to mix the additives and oil
thoroughly. The mixture was then placed in a constant temperature
bath at 100 °C for 10 min to make the APEAA–HEA–MA
react with Ca2+ completely. After that, the sample bottle
was placed in an electric field for 30 min for oil–water separation
under the action of electric field. Finally, the mixture was maintained
in a constant temperature at 100 °C for about 20 min and then
cooled to room temperature. The amounts of calcium in crude petroleum
were then analyzed. Comparative experiments of using the APEAA, PAA,
HPMA, and PESA samples to remove calcium from crude petroleum were
also carried out.

Crude petroleum (10.00 g) was weighed
into a silica crucible, and
about 10.00 g of petroleum ether and 10.00 g of ethyl alcohol were
added into the oil sample. The mixture was slowly heated and then
ignited. Because petroleum ether and ethanol can get miscible with
water, adding them can remove the residual water from the crude petroleum
with the volatilization of them during the precombustion treatment
to prevent the liquid flooding of water–fuel mixture. After
combustion, the quartz crucible was transferred into a muffle furnace
and calcined at about 550 °C to remove the carbon residues. After
the ash was cooled to room temperature, a small quantity of distilled
water was added to wet the ash, and then the desired volume of nitric
acid and hydrochloric acid solution was added to dissolve the ash.
The mixture was allowed to heat slowly until a small volume of colorless
transparent liquid remained. Then, the solution was transferred quantitatively
into a volumetric flask. The residual calcium content of crude petroleum
was analyzed using ICP-MS.
