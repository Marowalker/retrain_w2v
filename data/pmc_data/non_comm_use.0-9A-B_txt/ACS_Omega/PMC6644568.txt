It is well-known
that the chemistry of aluminum is dominated by
Al(III) in the +3 oxidation state. Only during the past 2 decades
has the chemistry of Al(I) and Al(II) been rapidly developed. However,
if Al(I) and Al(III) are combined, the inherently high reactivities
of Al(I) and Al(III) mostly result in their coupling with each other
or interacting with surrounding elements, which easily results in
significant deactivation or quenching of the desired oxidation states,
as in the case of reported mixed valent Al-compounds. In this article,
we report an unprecedented type of organoaluminum system, C2Al4R4 (R = H, SiH3, Si(C6H5)3, SiiPrDis2, SiMe(SitBu3)2), whose lowest-energy
structure, C2Al4R4-01, contains two Al(I) and two Al(III) atoms. The global nature and
bonding motif of the parent C2Al4R4-01 (R = H) were supported by an extensive global isomeric
search, CBS-QB3 energy calculations, adaptive natural density partitioning,
and bond order analysis. Interestingly and in sharp contrast to most
organoaluminum species, C2Al4R4-01 is associated with little multicenter bonding. C2Al4R4-01 has a high feasibility
of being observed either in the gas or condensed phases (with suitable
substitutents). With well-separated Al(I) and Al(III), C2Al4R4-01 (with suitable substitutents)
could serve as the first Al/Al frustrated Lewis pair.

1 Introduction
Aluminum
is the third most abundant element in the Earth’s
crust, and its chemistry has long been a hot research topic. Aluminum-containing
materials have been used in various fields, e.g., hydrogen storage,
semiconductors, ceramics, and so forth.1−4 Most known aluminum compounds have the aluminum
atom(s) in a formal oxidation state of +3, which can be attributed
to the high stability of Al(III) (see A in Scheme 1) with an empty orbital. In
contrast, the chemistry of aluminum(I) has been much less developed
due to the low stability of the +1 oxidation state of Al, and only
in recent decades has the study of aluminum(I) received much attention.5−8

Scheme 1 Exemplified Al(III) and Al(I) Species
The +1 oxidation state Al(I) with two empty orbitals and
one electron
lone pair (B in Scheme 1) will behave similarly to carbene species.9−12 Simple Al(I) species like AlH, AlX (X = F, Cl, Br, I), and Al2O have long been known to exist in the gas phase at high temperature
and low pressure.7,13−15 Yet, stable
Al(I) compounds remained unknown until 1991. The first crystallized
polymeric Al(I) compound, (Cp*Al)4, was reported to stably
exist at room temperature.16 Subsequently,
more and more stable Al(I) compounds have been reported and have found
various important applications such as in catalysis, materials, agrochemicals,
and others.7,11,12,17−22

Simply from the electronic features shown in Scheme 1, it can be seen that Al(III)
is a Lewis
acid and that Al(I) with an electron lone pair can be viewed as a
Lewis base. Therefore, when Al(I) and Al(III) are combined, the Al(I)
center is prone to undergo direct coordination reactions with the
Al(III) center or with other Al(I) center(s).16,23,24 Furthermore, when the Al(I) and Al(III)
centers approach each other, they have a high chance of undergoing
a disproportionation reaction. For example, R1AlAlR3 with Al(I)/Al(III) (C in Scheme 2) would be transformed into the thermodynamically
more stable structure R1RAl–AlR2 with
Al(II)/Al(II) (D in Scheme 2) for substituents H, Cl, and CH3.17 As a result, the activities of Al(III)’s
Lewis acidity and Al(I)’s Lewis base are both lost; i.e., Al(III)
and Al(I) should most probably become deactivated or quenched. Utilizing
bulky substituents, a stable compound E with Al(I) and
Al(III) (see E in Scheme 2) was synthesized in 2001.23 In E, Al(I) and Al(III) are connected by a dative bond,
and the activities of both Al(I) and Al(III) are quenched by the donor–acceptor
interaction.17,24

Is It Possible To Obtain Organoaluminum Species
with Well-Separated
Al(I)/Al(III)?
In this article, we report a special molecular
type, C2Al4R4, whose low-energy structure 01 has well-separated Al(I) and Al(III). The stability of
the cyclic C2Al4 core can be ascribed to the
appreciable rigidity of the skeletal C atoms in sp3 hybridization.
Moreover, the very weak Al(I)–Al(III) interaction indicates
that C2Al4R4-01 can
be classified as the first Al/Al frustrated Lewis pair (FLP).2,25,26 Besides gas-phase detection,
we show that suitable substitution could very promisingly facilitate
the laboratory synthesis of 01 under condensed conditions,
e.g., C2Al4R2R′2, where R/R′ = SiH3, R/R′ = Si(C6H5)3, and R = SiH3/R′ = Si(C6H5)3, SiiPrDis2, or SiMe(SitBu3)2.

2 Results and Discussion
Our extensive “skeleton-ligand”
cluster-growth calculations
resulted in a total of 3442 C2Al4H4 isomers as local minima at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The number
of isomers is surprisingly large, indicating both the complexity of
hydrogenated carbon–aluminum species and the importance of
the global isomeric study. For simplicity, we present the 22 low-energy
isomers that lie within 20 kcal/mol at the eventual CBS-QB3 level
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1 Isomers (ΔE < 20 kcal/mol) of C2Al4H4 at the CBS-QB3 level. The gray balls
represent carbon atoms, and the pink balls represent aluminum atoms.
The isomers are labeled 01–22. The
values denote the CBS-QB3 relative energies in kcal/mol. For 01 and 02, the bond distances in Å were
obtained at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) level and the values in brackets
are at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level.

2.1 Structural and Bonding Features of Low-Lying
C2Al4H4 Isomers
In general,
on the basis of the skeletal (core) characteristics of the obtained
isomers (see Figure 1), they can be sorted into three categories: (1) Al(I)/Al(III): 01 (0.00), 03 (5.48), 04 (7.80), 05 (7.92), and 19 (18.53); (2) cage: 02 (2.79) and 06 (12.03); and (3) planar tetracoordinate
carbon (ptC): 07 (12.90), 09 (13.14), 10 (14.99), 14 (17.41), 15 (17.42), 16 (17.82), 17 (17.91), 20 (18.82), 21 (18.83), and 22 (19.12). Note that the value
in parentheses denotes the relative energy (in kcal/mol) of each isomer
with reference to isomer 01. The T1 diagnostics
of Lee and Taylor are often used as a qualitative estimate of the
degree of multireference character of a system and the reliability
of single reference methods.27 All T1 values are smaller than or around 0.02 (see Table S1) (except for bicapped structure 06, with T1 being 0.028). This indicates
that, in general, the considered structures have no significant multireference
character and our CBS-QB3 calculations based on the single reference
functions are reliable. The T1 values of former key
structures 01, 02, 03, and 04 are 0.018, 0.016, 0.017, and 0.017, respectively.

The type-1 class of C2Al4H4 isomers
contains both low-valent Al(I) and normal valent Al(III), which are
well-separated in space. In the quasi-planar C2Al2 ring of 01, 03, and 04, the
two bridgehead Al atoms form the two Al(III), whereas the two opposite
sp3 carbon atoms are linked by two Al(I) ligands. In contrast
to 01, 03, and 04, the only
Al(III) is located at the CAlC center and three Al(I) atoms are connected
to one sp3 carbon in isomers 05 and 19. Interestingly, 01, 03, and 04 with a lower Al(I)/Al(III) ratio (i.e., 1/1) are energetically
more stable than 05 and 19 with a much higher
Al(I)/Al(III) ratio (i.e., 3/1).

From the distance values of
the two Al(III) (2.622, 2.567, and
2.607 Å, respectively) (see Table 1), four-membered ring isomers 01, 03, and 04 seem to have an Al–Al cross
bond. However, the small Mayer bond indexes, i.e., 0.06, 0.10 and
0.09, respectively, show that the bridgehead interaction is very weak.
The unusually short Al–Al distance in 01, 03, and 04 should be a result of the rigid skeleton
effect of the C2Al2 ring. This is quite similar
to very recently reported beryllium-containing clusters, in which
the contact of Be–Be is unusually close yet with little bonding
interaction.28−30 Thus, the two bridgehead Al atoms should be viewed
as tricoordinate Al(III). The remaining two Al atoms are one-coordinate
and could be viewed as Al(I) sites. The structural differences among 01, 03, and 04 lie in the different
allocation of two Al(I). The Al(I)–Al(I) distances in 01, 03, and 04 are 3.263, 4.767,
and 6.269 Å, respectively, with corresponding Mayer bond order
values of 0.14, 0.02, and 0.01. The slight Al(I)–Al(I) interaction
in 01 could account for its significantly lower energy
than 03 and 04.

Å) and Mayer Bond Indexes (MBI) of the Four-Membered Ring of
Isomers 01, 03, and 04
a Isomers 01, 03, and 04 are at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) level.

The chemical bonding nature of the most stable isomer 01 is further characterized in Figure 2 from adaptive natural density partitioning
(AdNDP)
analysis, which has been successfully applied in many scientific papers.31−34 Isomer 01 has two aluminum lone pairs on two Al(I)
and ten classical localized bonds, i.e., six 2c–2e C–Al
σ-bonds, two 2c–2e Al–H σ-bonds, and two
2c–2e C–H σ-bonds. The occupation number (ON)
of the two aluminum lone pairs are both 1.97|e|.
The ten 2c–2e σ-bonds have large ON values ranging from
1.83|e| to 2.00|e|. Therefore, 01 possesses little multicenter bonding. Clearly, the bonding
of isomer 01 presents a marked contrast to that of most
organoaluminum species, which usually have multicenter bonding due
to the electron-deficient characteristics of aluminum.

of C2Al4H4-01 obtained
by AdNDP analysis. “ON”
denotes the occupation number on the localized orbital.

The type-2 class of C2Al4H4 isomers
contains cage-like 02 and 06, both comprising
a cage structure. Yet, the inherent electron-counting rule is different.
Isomer 02 can be viewed as an Al-substituted Wade–Mingos
cluster C2Al3H4R (here R is Al) with n + 1 skeletal electron pairs (n = 5).
Isomer 06 is a C–C bonded hyper-closo C2Al4H4 cluster with n skeletal
electron pairs (n = 6). We have also considered the
C–C separated hyper-closo C2Al4H4 cluster at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) level. However, it has
two imaginary frequencies, and upon relaxation, it would lead to an
isomer that lies as high as 34.37 kcal/mol at the CBS-QB3 level.

It is very interesting to find that among the 22 C2Al4H4 low-lying isomers, the number of ptC isomers
amounts to nearly half. This could be partly ascribed to the peculiar
features of aluminum, i.e., Al is electropositive (relative to carbon)
and has an atomic size that would easily allow for the formation of
a ptC structure as a local minimum.35−37 Of particular note,
there are two types of carbon atoms in the ptC species. In one type
(10 and 20), both carbon atoms feature a
ptC nature, namely, a double ptC core (dptC38), whereas in the other type (07, 09, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, and 22), one carbon is ptC and the other
is sp3. Although the parent C2Al4 core is truly the global minimum,38 the
present calculations show that hydrogenation can pose a great effect
on the isomerism, destabilizing the dptC and ptC forms in C2Al4H4.

It is clear that at the composite
CBS-QB3 level using B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p)
geometries, C2Al4H4 has global minimum
structure 01 followed by cage isomer 02 by
2.79 kcal/mol. For further refinement, we reoptimized the former low-lying
isomers 01 and 02 at the rather costly CCSD(T)/
cc-pVTZ level. As shown in Figure 1, the key bond distances of both isomers with both
methods agree consistently with each other.

2.2 Chemical
Properties of Isomer C2Al4H4-01
The four Al
atoms in the lowest-energy isomer C2Al4H4-01 can be classified into two types: two Al(I)
and two Al(III). There is almost negligible interaction between Al(I)
and Al(III) according to the Mayer bond order values and AdNDP analysis.
In this sense, Al(I) and Al(III) can be viewed as being “separated”
from each other. Since Al(I) comprises both an electron lone pair
and empty orbitals, Al(I) should be associated both with the Lewis
base and Lewis acid features. In contrast, Al(III) with one empty
orbital should only possess the acid feature. We took frequently used
diagnostic molecules, e.g., carbon monoxide (CO),39,40 as an electron donor and the simplest boranes (BR3)41,42 as an electron acceptor to sense the above interesting features
of aluminum. CO can couple both with Al(I) and Al(III) with corresponding
binding energies of 2.85 and 7.42 kcal/mol at the CBS-QB3 level. The
H-substituted BR3, i.e., BH3, interacts with
Al(I) with a binding energy of 22.53 kcal/mol. Hence, in C2Al4H4-01, Al(I) is dominated by
Lewis base character and accompanied by minor Lewis acidity, whereas
Al(III) is solely a Lewis acid.

To the best of our knowledge,
we are not aware of any examples that comprise well-separated Al(I)
and Al(III) in the same molecule. Note that in some mixed-valent Al
compounds, although the notation Al(I)/Al(III) is still used, the
two Al types are in fact deactivated or quenched due to the effective
donor–acceptor interaction.17,23,24 Furthermore, the separated Al(I)/Al(III) would face
energetic competition from other isomers resulting from the disproportionation
reaction. Calculations have shown that the donor–acceptor bonded
Al(I) → Al(III) structure R1Al(I) → Al(III)R3 (C in Scheme 2) are energetically less stable than the Al(II)–Al(II)
bonded structure R1RAl(II)–Al(II)R2 for
some substituents.17 We postulate that
the successful holding of well-separated Al(I)/Al(III) in 01 benefits from the rigid sp3-C within the CAlCAl ring.
Interestingly, when the Al(I) and Al(III) sites within 01 were manually put together, the optimization led to isomer 09, which lies at 13.14 kcal/mol at the CBS-QB3 level. Thus,
the intramolecular combination of Al(I) and Al(III) within 01 is energetically disfavored. Besides, intuitively, the two Al(I)
sites (each with the donor and acceptor feature) might form two sets
of dative bonds from one to the other. Yet, the Mayer bond order value
and the AdNDP result indicate that there is little interaction between
them. The reason could again be ascribed to the rigidity of the tetrahedral
carbon, which frustrates the orbital overlap between the lone pair
and empty orbitals of both Al(I) atoms.

2.3 Viability
of C2Al4R4-01
Being the global minimum structure
and difficult to transform into other topological forms, 01 is stable intrinsically, at least in theory. Yet, one should be
aware that a quantum chemical minimum location does not mean the existence
of a molecule. The generation, detection, and storage of a molecule
usually depend on various factors including the synthetic precursor
and environment. Our computed atomization energy (AE) of C2Al4H4-01 with respect to 2C +
4Al + 4H (each atom is in its electronic ground state) is 707.07 kcal/mol.
By comparison, the experimentally known CH3Al43 has an AE value of 355.42 kcal/mol. The average
AE values (divided by the total number of atoms) of C2Al4H4-01 and CH3Al are comparable,
i.e., 70.71 and 71.08 kcal/mol. Besides, due to the huge structural
discrepancy, the conversion of 01 to isomers 02, 03, and 04 should be kinetically hindered.
Thus, C2Al4H4-01 can
exist in the gas phase.

What about the fate of 01 in the condensed phase? With an increased concentration of molecules,
the condensation of fragments and the molecule itself (i.e., oligomerization)
might take place to lower the energy of the system. We first considered
the sequential processes C2Al4H4-01 → C2H4 (ethylene) + 4Al(g)
and Al(g) → Al(s). The former reaction is still endothermic
by 51.74 kcal/mol at the CBS-QB3 level. The latter reaction is exothermic
by 70.17 kcal/mol (derived from the vaporization of condensed Al)
when the condensation of Al fragments is considered (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_vaporization#cite_note-GeWang2009-4). Therefore, the overall process C2Al4H4-01 → C2H4 (ethylene)
+ 4Al(s) has an exothermicity of 18.43 kcal/mol. Second, we computed
the reaction heats of the C2Al4H4-01 → 2C2Al4H4-01 dimerization process by considering the possible
interactive sets Al(I)/Al(III) and Al(I)/Al(I). At the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)+D3(BJ)//B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level, the dimerization is exothermic by 31.59 (Al(I)/Al(III)) and
25.61 kcal/mol (Al(I)/Al(I)), respectively. This indicates that in
thermodynamics, the formation of species 01 bearing the
simplest substituent (R = H) is disfavored in the condensed phase.

Clearly, to make C2Al4R4-01 feasible in the condensed phase, consideration of non-H
substituents is indispensible, which can induce both electronic and
steric stabilization. For the four substituents R, we considered both
homosubstitution (i.e., C2Al4R4)
and heterosubstitution (C2Al4R2R2′). For the former C2Al4H4 isomers within 20 kcal/mol at the CBS-QB3 level, we first
evaluated the substitution effect of all H atoms by the simplest silyl
group, SiH3 (known as an electropositive or electron-donating
group). We found that the ground state nature of 01 can
be maintained, and notably the cage-like isomer 02 even
becomes less stable than 03 and 04 (both
with separated Al(I) and Al(III) as in 01) (see Figure S1). The effectiveness of SiH3 could be ascribed to its electron-donating ability partially stabilizing
the Lewis acid site (here, tricoordinate Al) of 01, 03, and 04 as it operates to the triply bonded
silicon.44 Further consideration of solvent
effects with the presence of benzene (chosen due to its absence of
lone pair electrons that can deactivate Al(I) and Al(III)) still supports
the lowest-energy nature of 01 and indicates that cage-like 02 again lies higher than 03 and 04 (see Figure S2). For bulky groups (R′),
considering the limitation of both CPU time and memory size and considering
consistency, we calculated C2Al4R2R′2-01 and C2Al4R2R′2-02 (R/R′ =
SiH3, Si(C6H5)3, SiiPrDis2, SiMe(SitBu3)2) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)+D3(BJ)//RHF/3-21G(d) level
(see Scheme 3). For
C2Al4R2R′2 (R/R′
= SiH3, Si(C6H5)3, SiiPrDis2, SiMe(SitBu3)2), 01 is more stable than 02 (see Table 2), manifesting
the effectiveness of various silyl groups in stabilizing 01 over 02.

What about
dimerization in these silyl-substituted 01 compounds?
As shown in Table 2, for R/R′ = SiH3/SiH3, SiH3/Si(C6H5)3, SiH3/SiiPrDis2, the dimerization is exothermic
at −25.15, −44.44, and −49.40 kcal/mol, respectively,
at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)+D3(BJ)//RHF/3-21G(d) level, indicating that
the three sets of silyl groups cannot suppress the dimerization. For
R/R′ = Si(C6H5)3/Si(C6H5)3 and SiH3/SiMe(SitBu3)2, in spite of numerous attempts,
we failed to locate any covalently bound minimum dimer of 01 with either Al(I)/Al(I) or Al(I)/Al(III) interaction. This hints
that suitable silyl groups with sufficient steric effects might prevent 01 from dimerization/oligomerization. Note that the intermolecular
Al(I)–Al(III) interaction to form two Al(II) sites takes place
via two steps: the first is to form a donor–acceptor complex
between Al(I) and Al(III), and the second is to undergo R migration
from Al(III) to Al(I). Very large silyl groups can prohibit the first
step from taking place, making Al(I) + Al(III) → 2Al(II) unlikely.

The well-separated Al(I) and Al(III) within C2Al4H4-01 remind us of another interesting
topic: the frustrated Lewis pair (FLP).25,26 An FLP is
the combination of a Lewis acid and a Lewis base where the acid and
base are either sterically or electronically restricted from interaction
with each other. Bulky substituted FLPs have found rich applications
in small-molecule activation and splitting (e.g., H2, CO2).45−50 Most of the reported FLPs are heteronuclear, containing P/B, C/B,
N/B, or P/Al moieties, and the first homonuclear FLP with B/B was
published only very recently (in 2015) by Kinjo and co-workers.51 The presently predicted global C2Al4R4-01 with well-separated group
13 Al(I) and Al(III) surely deserves to be considered as the previously
unreported Al/Al FLP and the second homonuclear FLP. Our model calculations
at the CBS-QB3 level showed that C2Al4H4-01 can split H2 by the cooperation
of the Al(I) and Al(III) sites with a Gibbs free energy barrier 33.52
kcal/mol (T = 298 K). With R/R′ = SiH3/SiH3, the Gibbs free energy barrier for H2 splitting is decreased to 29.45 kcal/mol. The barrier is
comparable to that of the P/Al FLP (25.44 kcal/mol).50 It is worthy of note that in addition to the above sterically
protected strategy of the two Al (I) atoms each with two empty orbitals
within C2Al4R4-01 by
applying bulky substituents, another alternative stabilizing approach
could be to use the Lewis base to bind Al(I) by donating a pair of
electrons, as in the case of the reported monomeric aluminum(I) compound
[{HC(CMeNAr)2}Al] (Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3).12 The thermodynamic
and kinetic influences of this kind of donor to the Al(I) sites of
C2Al4R4-01 deserve to
be studied in the future.

3 Conclusions
Quantum chemical calculations showed that a new organoaluminum
series C2Al4R4 with optional R (e.g.,
H, SiH3, Si(C6H5)3, SiiPrDis2, SiMe(SitBu3)2) might possesses the global isomer 01 with
two sets of well-separated Al(I) and Al(III). This is in contrast
with known mixed-valent Al compounds in which Al(I) is easily deactivated
by Al(III) or converted to Al(II). The unique feature of C2Al4R4-01 allows it to be viewed
as the first Al/Al FLP.

4 Theoretical Methods
To study the low-energy isomers of C2Al4R4, we first performed a global isomeric search for the parent
molecule C2Al4H4 (i.e., R = H) and
subsequently evaluated substitutional effects for relevant structures.
For C2Al4H4, it is reasonable to
consider it as a “skeleton-ligand” type, i.e., hydrogen
atoms are “ligands” around the C2Al4 skeleton (core). To determine the isomeric structures as many compounds
as possible, we applied our locally developed “skeleton-ligand
cluster-growth” method.66 First, the isomeric search of
the small C2Al4 core was undertaken at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level via our “grid-based comprehensive isomeric strategy”,67 which has been successfully tested in our previous
works.52−56 Second, via the “cluster-growth pattern”, each optimized
C2Al4 core was saturated by hydrogen atoms one
by one in the forms of terminal, bridge, and delta-bonding types.
For each hydrogenated structure, B3LYP/6-31G(d) structural and frequency
calculations were carried out before the next hydrogenation. The obtained
isomers within 30 kcal/mol at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were selected
for further refinement calculations at the composite CBS-QB3 level.57,58 Note that in CBS-QB3 calculations, the geometries and frequencies
were computed at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) level followed by a series
of sophisticated and high-level single-point energy evaluations with
the eventual basis set extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS)
limit. The resulting low-lying isomers with close energy were subject
to costly CCSD(T)59/cc-pVTZ structural
optimization. For the isomers of C2Al4H4 within 20 kcal/mol at CBS-QB3, we calculated the CCSD(T) T1 diagnostics27 at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ
level and evaluated substitutional effects (with the electronically
positive substituent group SiH3) and solvent effects (single-point,
in benzene) at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) level. For non-hydrogen groups
(R/R′ = SiH3, R/R′ = Si(C6H5)3, R = SiH3/R′ = Si(C6H5)3, SiiPrDis, SiMe(SitBu3)2), the RHF/3-21G(d) calculation
was used to fully optimize C2Al4R2R′2-01 and C2Al4R2R′2-02 followed by the
frequency calculation at the RHF/3-21G(d) level, and to produce better
energetics, the stationary points were further computed at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)+D3(BJ)//RHF/3-21G(d)
level of theory. Here “D3(BJ)” denotes the correction
for the dispersion effect by using the D3 version of Grimme’s
dispersion with Becke–Johnson damping.60 For all electronic structure calculations, the commercial Gaussian
0361 and Gaussian 0962 package suites were used. To discuss the nature of the
bonding of key structures of C2Al4R4 (R = H), Mayer bond order index63 and
the adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP) analyses64,65 were carried out at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) level.
