Biomass-derived
carbons for supercapacitors provide a promising
and sustainable strategy to address the worldwide energy and climate
change challenges. Here, we have designed and constructed three-dimensional
nitrogen/sulfur-codoped hierarchically porous carbons for high-performance
supercapacitor electrode materials in a one-step process, in which
ginkgo leaf is used as a carbon source and S source and ammonium nitrate
(AN) is used as an activating agent and a N source. During the synchronous
carbonization and activation process, AN could be decomposed completely
into gaseous byproducts and be removed easily without leaving residues
after product formation. The as-synthesized ginkgo leaf-derived carbons
exhibited a high specific capacitance of 330.5 F g–1 at a current density of 0.5 A g–1 and a capacitance
of 252 F g–1 even at a high current density of 10
A g–1 with an excellent capacitance retention of
85.8% after 10 000 cycles in 6 mol L–1 KOH
electrolyte. The present study provides an efficient, sustainable,
and facile approach to prepare renewable hierarchically porous carbons
as advanced electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.

Introduction
Biomass-derived carbons,
referred to as highly aromatic and carbon-rich
porous materials, can be synthesized through carbonization and activation
of natural biomass1−3 and have been greatly concerned in energy storage
and conversion area because of their large surface area, high porosity,
excellent thermal and chemical stability, low cost, and high energy
and power density in electric devices.4−6 During the carbonization
process, biomass undergoes a series of complex chemical processes,
including chemical bond cleavage, isomerization, polymerization, and
heteroatom removal, resulting in three-dimensional (3D) skeletal networks
of porous carbons.7 The porous structures
and large surface areas of biomass-derived carbons make them promising
for energy storage, especially for supercapacitors.

Supercapacitors
can be generally classified into two types based
on the charge-storage mechanism.8−10 One is the pseudocapacitor whose
capacitances come from the reversible faradic reactions occurring
at the electrode surface. The other is the electrical double-layer
capacitor (EDLC), whose capacitances arise from the rapid accumulation
of ionic charges at electrode/electrolyte interface. Typically, carbon
materials mainly exhibit EDLC characteristics because of their inertness,
high electrical conductivity, large surface area, and high porosity.2,7 The large surface areas and adapted porous structures facilitate
the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions to the inner suface.3,11 It is evidenced that micropores can increase the specific surface
area and provide large specific capacitances but hinder the diffusion
of electrolyte ions, increasing the diffusion resistance, whereas
mesopores and macropores can provide broad ion transport pathways,
reducing the diffusion resistance, promoting the electrical double
layer formation, and improving the rate capacitance performance.12−15 Therefore, hierarchically porous carbons (HPCs) with interconnected
micropores, mesopores, and macropores could provide both large surface
areas and fast channels for electrolyte ion transport, preferred for
high-performance EDLCs.

In addition to carbonization, activation
also facilitates generating
large amounts of nanopores, especially micropores and mesopores.3,16 Activation refers to a process of converting inactive or less active
carbonaceous materials or carbon skeletons into activated carbons,
which was often conducted simultaneously or after the carbonization.
To activate biomass-derived carbons, two main methods, physical and
chemical activation, can be used.3 The
physical activation, using activating agents such as steam,17,18 CO2,19,20 and air,21,22 is a simple and green synthetic strategy, which does not require
postsynthesis washing to remove any impurities and byproducts generated
during the activation process, but often needs high temperature. In
comparison, the chemical activation of porous carbons is more commonly
used, due to its lower activation temperature and well-developed and
interconnected hierarchical pores.1 KOH,1,16,23,24 ZnCl2,12,25 and H3PO426 are the most commonly used chemical
activating agents. Zhang et al.27 prepared
a 3D hierarchically porous carbon through pyrolysis of garlic skin
followed by KOH activation. The obtained garlic skin-derived carbon
has a high specific surface area of 2,818 m2 g–1 and a pore volume of 1.327 cm3 g–1.
As an electrode for a supercapacitor, the obtained carbon displayed
excellent specific capacitances of 427 and 315 F g–1 at current densities of 0.5 and 50 A g–1, respectively.
Hou et al.12 used natural silk to prepare
hierarchically porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets via ZnCl2 activation. The obtained carbon nanosheets have a specific
surface area of 2,494 m2 g–1 and a pore
volume of 2.28 cm3 g–1, exhibiting a
capacitance of 242 F g–1 and energy density of 102
Wh kg–1. Compared with physical activation, chemical
activation tends to achieve higher specific surface and pore volume
but brings burden in postsynthesis, which often requires postactivation
washing or acid washing to remove the excess activating reagent or
byproducts yielded during the activation process. Some other techniques
have also been employed to prepare HPCs such as the hard and soft
template method,28,29 still requiring removal of the
templating agents in the postsynthesis process.

Herein, ammonium
nitrate (AN) activation is performed combined
with pyrolysis of ginkgo leaf (GL) to prepare a 3D hierarchically
porous carbon in a one-step process. As we know, AN is a strong oxidizer,
could decompose into gaseous phase of HNO3(g) and NH3(g) as long as it was heated up to 110 °C,30 and is expected to etch the GL-derived carbons
through a redox reaction to generate large amounts of pores. The massive
gaseous byproducts such as CO2, H2O, NO2, N2O, and N2,30,31 from the redox reactions, could further promote the formation of
porous structures. The NH3(g) is an efficient N dopant
for carbon materials,32 which could enhance
conductivity of the carbon electrode, increase specific capacitance
through pseudocapacitance, and improve wettability of the electrode.33 Moreover, AN decomposes completely into gaseous
products at temperatures higher than 220 °C and can be removed
easily without leaving residues after product formation. In autumn,
GLs, the carbon source, wither and fall off the ginkgo trees, which
are largely cultivated in China, France, and South Carolina, being
waste on the ground. The dry GL is composed of about 45.1% carbon,
34.0% oxygen, 1.2% nitrogen, 0.7% sulfur, 5.5% hydrogen, and 13.4%
ash.34,35 The relatively higher content of N and S
compared to that in other biomass such as coconut sheath36 and corn stover37 indicates that the GL-derived porous carbons can be self-doped with
N and S heteroatoms. It is found that the incorporation of N and S
increases electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and
wettability of the electrode and contributes to pseudocapacitances.38−41 In this work, we demonstrated a one-step process for the synthesis
of N/S-codoped hierarchically porous carbons (NSHPCs) with GL and
AN as a carbon source and an activating agent, respectively. The as-synthesized
NSHPCs with 3D interconnected hierarchically porous structures displayed
a large specific surface area and excellent capacitance performance
with high energy and power density.

Results and Discussion
The key steps involved in the preparation of NSHPCs are schematically
illustrated in Figure 1. GLs were chosen as a carbon source and thermally carbonized to
produce HPCs because of their wide range of biomass sources, low cost,
easy processability, and high carbon yield and because they are rich in N, S heteroatoms
and suitable water conveyance channels. The GLs underwent pulverization,
activation, and carbonization processes, resulting in a 3D hierarchically
porous architecture. AN was used as the activating agent to generate
large amounts of pores on carbons during the carbonization process.
The representative synthesized NSHPC1.5 prepared at a carbonization
temperature of 700 °C with AN/GL mass ratio of 1.5 underwent
three major weight losses: 45.8% starts from 160 to 203 °C, 22.3%
from 203 to 234 °C, and 13.2% from 234 to 800 °C (Figure S1, Supporting Information). An exothermic
peak centered at 200 °C corresponds to partial oxidation of the
biomass carbon by AN and its decomposition product of HNO3(g). Another exothermic peak centered at 222 °C could be ascribed
to deep decomposition of AN and further reactions of the biomass carbons
with gaseous products such as NO2 and NH3.30,38 During these reactions, massive gaseous byproducts like NO2, N2O, N2, CO2, and H2O gases were generated. The sudden massive released gases converted
the as-synthesized NSHPC bush to a graphene-like layered carbon material
(Figure 2A), which
has well-constructed interconnected open macropores (Figure 2B) and a few water conveyance
holes (Figure 2C),
while majority of pores are water conveyance holes in the GL-derived
carbons carbonized without AN (Figure S2). Furthermore, large amounts of nanopores were observed on the NSHPC1.5 carbon sheets (Figure 2D,E). It was found that some inorganic salts contained
in plant leaves, mainly CaCO3, MgCO3, CaSO4, and MgSO4, could generate large amounts of small
pores during the acid washing process.27 We examined whether these hierarchical pores were induced by AN,
acid washing, or both. Considerable numbers of nanopores were still
observed in the non-acid-washed NSHPC1.5 sample (Figure S3), which means AN can not only create
macropores but also create small nanopores. The AN used here as the
activating agent may perform the following main reactions 1   2   3   4   5  As the carbonization temperature increased,
AN gradually melted and partially decomposed into HNO3(g), NH3(g), and N2O (1, 2) and the oxidation
(3, 4) of the biomass carbons by AN and HNO3(g) occurred
simultaneously. The redox reactions between biomass carbons and AN/HNO3(g) etched the carbon skeletons and generated large amounts
of nanopores. The massive gaseous byproducts, such as NO2, N2O, N2, CO2, and H2O gases, swelled the biomass carbons to graphene sheetlike carbon
structures and further promoted the formation of porous structures.
As we know, the micropores can increase the specific surface area
and provide active sites to enhance the specific capacitance, while
mesopores and macropores can provide pathways for high-rate transport
of electrolyte ions, facilitate a decrease in diffusion resistance,
and subsequently improve the electrochemical performance.12−14,42 More detailed microstructure
information on the representative NSHPC1.5 was obtained
from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images.
The massive nanopores (Figure 2E) and (002) characteristic lattice fringes (Figure 2F), indexed to the amorphous
graphitic carbon layers with a spacing of 3.6 Å, were clearly
resolved. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the NSHPC1.5 showed a broad graphitic stacking peak at 24.9° and
a weak peak at 43.6° (Figure S4).
In addition, the as-obtained NSHPC1.5 showed a much sharper
diffraction peak at a lower angle compared with the NSHPC0 (Figure 2G), indicating
that more regular and fluffy layer structures were formed when GL
was carbonized with AN. As quantified by energy dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) in Figure 2H,
the weight % values of C, N, O, and S in the NSHPC1.5 were
72.64, 11.28, 10.31, and 5.77%, respectively. Correlated EDS mapping
showed that C, N, O, and S elements were clearly distributed on the
NSHPC1.5 (Figure 2I), confirming that the as-synthesized carbon materials were
successfully doped with N and S.

porous carbon.

Because GL is rich in
N and S elements, the GL-derived HPCs can
self-dope with N and S elements, as can be seen from Figure 3A that 4.56% weight of N and
6.43% weight of S were doped in the NSHPC0 carbonized without
AN. In Figure 3A, the
weight % of the N element in the NSHPCs carbonized at 700 °C
gradually increased from 4.56 to 13.06% with the mass ratio of AN/GL
raised from 0 to 2, indicating that AN could be used as a N-doping
agent to produce N-doped carbons. It should be noted that the higher
the amount of the AN added, the lower the yields of the NSHPCs (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The
loss of NSHPCs could be ascribed to the consistent redox reaction
of the GL-derived carbons with AN. The weight % of the S element displayed
a slight drop as the content of AN increased, mainly due to the increasing
content of N. Furthermore, the weight % of the N element of NSHPC1.5 decreased from 16.38 to 8.69% as the carbonization temperature
increased from 500 to 800 °C (Figure 3B), due to removal of foreign atoms at high
temperature. It should be noted that a higher carbonization temperature
would cause lower yields of the NSHPCs (Table S1), perhaps due to the digestion of carbon skeleton at high
temperature.

the NSHPCs
synthesized at (A) various AN/GL mass ratios at a constant carbonization
temperature of 700 °C and at (B) various carbonization temperatures
at a constant mass ratio of 1.5, quantified by EDS. Intensity ratios
of the G to D bands (IG/ID) were evaluated from Raman spectra of the NSHPCs synthesized
at (C) various AN/GL mass ratios and (D) various carbonization temperatures.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful
technique to provide detailed
structural information of the carbon skeleton, especially considering
the fact that conjugated and double carbon–carbon bonds lead
to high Raman intensities.43−45 The Raman spectra of all NSHPC
samples showed two well-known bands: The G-band located at around
1580 cm–1 is a result of sp2-graphitized
carbon, and the D-band at around 1350 cm–1 is associated
with the disordered carbon induced by structural defects and impurities.45 The intensity ratio of the G-band to D-band (IG/ID) represents the degree
of structural order, as well as the graphitization level.43,44 As seen from Figure 3C,D, the IG/ID values of NPHPC0, NSHPC1, NSHPC1.5, NSHPC2, NSHPC-500, NSHPC-600, and NSHPC-800 were 1.31,
1.03, 0.91, 0.77, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.92, respectively. The IG/ID value gradually
decreased with the increasing amount of AN added at constant temperature,
due to the heteroatom N doping. Furthermore, the higher carbonization
temperature led to a higher IG/ID value, which means higher structural alignment.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to investigate
the surface feature and chemical composition of the NSHPCs. As shown
in Figure 4A, XPS survey
spectra of the NSHPC1.5 displayed four peaks comprising
C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, and S 2p, indicating the presence of N and S dopants
with the content of 9.91 and 2.66%, consistent with the EDS results.
The high-resolution C 1s spectrum showed a broadened peak with a small
tail that can be deconvoluted into five individual subpeaks of carbon
components (Figure 4B), with the binding energies centered at 283.8, 284.4, 285.5, 286.7,
and 289.0 eV corresponding to C–S–C, sp2-hybridized
C=C, sp3-hybridized C–C, C–N, and
C=O, respectively.46 In the N 1s
spectra, four subpeaks of N species were clearly resolved (Figure 4C), corresponding
to pyridinic-N (398.0 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.6 eV), graphitic-N (400.2
eV), and oxidized-N (405.9 eV).29,47,48 Among them, the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N possess a desirable electron-donating
feature and high charge transfer, which are propitious to improve
electrochemical performance, while the graphitic-N has a significant
effect on accelerating electron transfer and enhancing electrical
conductivity of carbon materials. The oxidized-N addressed at the
defect of the graphite lattice center improves specific conductance
as well. The S 2p spectrum could be deconvoluted into three individual
subpeaks associated with C–S–C 2p3/2 at 163.9
eV, C–S–C 2p1/2 at 165.1 eV, and C–SOx–C at 168.3 eV (Figure 4D). The S species could contribute to causing
changes in the electronic density of state and arousing pseudocapacitances.29 The doping of heteroatoms (N, S, and O) into
the NSHPCs could improve their wettability and, more importantly,
could tailor electrical properties for enabling high-performance supercapacitors.

and (D) S 2p of the NSHPC1.5.

Besides the electrical conductivity and wettability, for
EDLCs,
the specific surface area (SBET) and corresponding
pore size distribution (PSD) also play important roles in electrical
capacitance. We performed N2 sorption isotherms on all
NSHPCs to characterize their surface properties. As seen from Figure 5A, all NSHPCs displayed
a hybrid type I/IV isotherm profile,49,50 a sharp rise
at low pressure (P/P0 < 0.01) contributed by the microporous structure, and an H3 hysteresis
loop at a high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.4) arisen from mesoporous and macroporous structures,
indicating hierarchically porous structures in the as-synthesized
NSHPCs. The pore volume (Vpore) of NSHPCs
increased obviously after AN activation, exhibiting more considerable
porosity and higher SBET. As the AN/GL
mass ratio increased from 0 to 2 at a constant temperature of 700
°C, SBET increased up to 15.66 times
from 47.9 to 672.2 m2 g–1, while Vpore increased up to 13 times from 0.04 to 0.52
cm3 g–1. The detailed porous properties
of the NSHPCs are listed in Table S1. As
the activation temperature increased from 500 to 800 °C at the
AN/GL mass ratio of 1.5, the SBET and Vpore of NSHPCs increased from 127.5 and 0.14
to 503.6 m2 g–1 and 0.41 cm3 g–1, respectively. However, both the SBET and Vpore reduced dramatically
when the activation temperature became 800 °C, probably due to
the digestion of carbon skeleton and the collapse of pores at high
carbonization temperature. The PSD is presented in Figure 5B. The cumulated volume is
separated by a vertical dashed line at 2 nm, left of which denotes
micropores (<2 nm), whereas right denotes mesopores (2–50
nm) and macropores (>50 nm). The dV/dD numerical values of NSHPCs are greater than zero, ranging from 1
to 100 nm, indicating that the coexistence of micropores, mesopores,
and macropores formed hierarchical porous structures in the NSHPCs.
Notably, the mesopores accounted for more percentage than micropores
and macropores in the AN-activated NSHPCs. The AN activation created
significantly large amount of mesopores, which increased with the
AN/GL mass ratio (Figure 5C) and the activation temperature, except for NSHPC-800 due
to the digestion of carbon skeleton and the collapse of pores at high
carbonization temperature (Figure 5D). The large SBET and
hierarchically porous structure are in favor of promoting capacitor
performance.51

distribution curves of the NSHPCs. The inset shows magnified pore
size distribution. Comparison of the corresponding specific surface
area and average pore size of the NSHPCs synthesized at (C) various
AN/GL mass ratios and (D) various carbonization temperatures.

Based on the high specific surface
area and hierarchically porous
characteristics, it is expected that NSHPCs would be a promising electrode
material for high-performance supercapacitors. Their capacitive performances
were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a three-electrode
system in 6 mol L–1 KOH solution at room temperature. Figure 6A shows typical CV
curves of NSHPCs treated at various AN/GL mass ratios and various
activation temperatures measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1 with a potential window between −1 and 0 V (versus saturated
calomel electrode (SCE)). The CV profiles of all samples show approximately
rectangular peaks, suggesting that EDLC capacitance is mainly involved
in the as-synthesized NSHPCs. Small redox humps were also observed
in these CV curves during the charge/discharge process, indicating
partial contribution from pseudocapacitance, due to the redox reaction
of the doped heteroatoms (N, S, and O).51,52 As seen from Figure 6A,B, the NSHPC2 exhibited the largest area of the CV curve and the highest
specific capacitance (277.5 F g–1 calculated from
the CV curve). The specific capacitance increased with the AN/GL mass
ratio, revealing that AN activation significantly improved the capacitance.
This improvement is mainly contributed by the gradually increased
surface area and the number of mesopores and micropores, which agrees
well with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) results in Figure 5, partly contributed
by the pseudocapacitance arisen from the redox reaction of heteroatoms,
especially N. It should be noted that the increased rate of specific
capacitance and surface area tended to slow down as the AN/GL mass
ratio increased from 0 to 2, whereas the NSHPC yield acceleratingly
decreased (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
We tried the reaction with the AN/GL mass ratio of 3 and found a big
drop in NSHPC yield to 12.1%. As seen from the thermogravimetric/differential
scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) curves in Figure S1, the decomposition of AN released large amounts of heat
in the carbonization and activation process, probably causing the
digestion of carbon skeleton and the low NSHPC yield. Considering
the input–output ratio, the reactions were conducted with the
AN/GL mass ratio no more than 2. In addition, the increasing calcination
temperature is beneficial for improving the specific capacitance,
as can be seen in Figure 6C, which is due to the enhanced graphitization and conductivity
of the NSHPCs. However, the capacitance reduced significantly to 191
F g–1 when the activation temperature increased
to 800 °C, due to the reduction of surface area and graphitization
level arisen from the digestion of carbon skeleton and the collapse
of pores at high carbonization temperature. CV profiles of the AN-activated
NSHPCs (Figure S5) at various scan rates
maintained the rectangular shape without obvious transformation even
at a very high scan rate of 500 mV s–1, indicating
rapid ion mobility and excellent frequency response, which can be
ascribed to the large amount of mesopores that promoted electrolyte
ion diffusion.

shows the GCD cycles. (G) Nyquist plots of the NSHPCs prepared at
various AN/GL mass ratios.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were performed
at various current densities to further reveal the capacitance performance
of the NSHPCs. All GCD curves of the obtained NSHPCs in Figures 6D and S6 displayed typical symmetrical triangular shapes at current
densities from 0.5 to 10 A g–1, demonstrating good
reversibility for charge/discharge processes as typical EDLCs. It
should be noted that some imperfect symmetries were observed from
0 to −0.3 V, mainly due to the existence of Faraday redox electrochemical
reactions of the N and S groups in the NSHPCs,29,53 in agreement with the CV curves. Severe deformations were observed
in the GCD curves of NSHPC0 (Figure S6A), due to small SBET with a
few mesopores, promoting ion diffusion during the charge/discharge processes. The
specific capacitances of the NSHPCs were calculated by GCD curves
at various current densities ranging from 0.5 to 10 A g–1 (Figure 6E). At a
current density of 0.5 A g–1, the NSHPC2 exhibited the largest specific capacitance of 330.5 F g–1, much higher than that of the non-AN-activated NSHPC0 with a capacitance of 48.8 F g–1, indicating that
AN activation manifestly promoted the capacitance performance, which
not only increased the SBET but also introduced
large amounts of hierarchical pores. The high content of AN and high
activation temperature are propitious to improve the specific capacitance,
in good agreement with the results of CV curves. NSHPC-800 is an exception,
which showed a decline in the specific capacitance due to the reduction
of SBET and number of hierarchical pores
arisen from the digestion of carbon skeleton and the collapse of pores
at high carbonization temperature. Figure 6E shows that the specific capacitance decreased
gradually with the increase of current density, probably due to the
fact that electrolyte ions did not have sufficient time to diffuse
to the inner pore interface at high current density in the rapid charge/discharge
process.54 The decrease gradually slowed
down since the current density was greater than 2 A g–1. The capacitance of NSHPC2 still maintained at 252 F
g–1 even at 10 A g–1, demonstrating
the excellent capacitance. The NSHPC2 displayed a high
specific capacitance compared with the reported carbon-based supercapacitors
(Table S2). Long-term cycling stability
of the NSHPC2 was further investigated using a continuous
GCD measurement at a current density of 10 A g–1. Figure 6F shows
the special capacitance retention of the NSHPC2 as a function
of charge/discharge cycle number, n, from continuous
GCD curves. The specific capacitance decreased gradually from 252
to 218 F g–1 in the initial 1250 cycles and then
showed better stability, and about 85.8% of the capacitance was preserved
even after 10 000 cycles. The AN-activated NSHPC2 exhibited excellent specific capacitance performance with a long
cycle life.

To further understand the electrochemical behaviors
of the NSHPCs,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried
out in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz. All Nyquist plots
of the NSHPCs prepared at various AN/GL mass ratios (Figure 6G) and various calcination
temperatures (Figure S7) exhibit a small
semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line in the
low-frequency region. As we know, the intersection of the Nyquist
plot with a real axis in the high-frequency region represents the
internal resistance of the system (RS),
while the radius of the semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer
resistance (RCT) and the slope of the
straight line represents the Warburg impedance (Zw). The small RS values of
NSHPC1, NSHPC1.5(700), NSHPC2, NSHPC-500,
NSHPC-600, and NSHPC-800 are 0.719, 0.712, 0.673, 0.690, 0.735, and
0.692 Ω, respectively, indicating good conductivities of the
NSHPCs in the electrolyte. Their RCT values
are 0.245, 0.141, 0.111, 0.435, 0.153, and 0.239 Ω, respectively,
revealing that they have low charge-transfer resistances between the
NSHPCs and the electrolyte interface. Almost vertical lines are observed
in the low-frequency region, indicating the typical double-layer capacitance
behavior with low diffusive resistances. A short-length line with
a slope of 45° in the medium-frequency region is also observed
for all of the AN-activated NSHPCs, named Warburg resistance, which
is the typical diffusive resistance of electrolyte ions to porous
electrode materials. The short length of the Warburg slope indicates
the low resistance of the ions transport to the NSHPCs. The NSHPC2 displayed the smallest RCT, indicating
that the charge/ion is efficiently transported, exhibiting excellent
electrochemical performance, benefiting from the hierarchical pores
and large heteroatom-doped surface area.

To evaluate the electrochemical
capacitive practical performances,
a symmetrical two-electrode system was assembled with a polypropylene
membrane separating the two same nickel foam electrodes painted with
the NSHPC2 and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)–KOH gel55 was used as a semisolid polymer electrolyte.
The electrochemical performance of the assembled symmetrical NSHPC2-based device was further examined by CV and GCD tests at
various scan rates from 0.5 to 200 mV s–1 and current
densities from 0.5 to 10 A g–1 within an operation
voltage window of 0–1.6 V. The relatively rectangular CV profiles
at various scan rates (Figure 7A) and the symmetrical triangular GCD profile at various current
densities (Figure 7B) without obvious transformation indicate an ideal electric double-layer
capacitor behavior. The Ragone plot for the NSHPC2 device
in Figure 7C shows
the relation between energy density and power density, which was calculated
on the basis of eqs 8 and 9, showing a specific energy density of
43.6 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 400 W kg–1 and remaining 14.2 Wh kg–1 at a
high-power density of 8000 W kg–1, demonstrating
the desired electrode material for a supercapacitor. The specific
capacitance retention of the NSHPC2 device at a current
density of 2 A g–1 is shown to be 79% after 5000
circulations in Figure 7D, exhibiting excellent capacitance stability in practical applications.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile and
sustainable strategy
to fabricate 3D N/S-codoped hierarchically porous carbons for high-performance
supercapacitors in a one-step synthesis using ginkgo leaf as a carbon
source and S source and ammonium nitrate (AN) as an activating agent
and a N source. The use of AN generated large amounts of mesopores
and micropores through chemical etching of the carbon skeletons by
redox reactions and released massive gaseous byproducts, which further
promoted the formation of hierarchical pores. The hierarchically porous
structure greatly increased the specific surface area and promoted
charge transport and rate performance. Consequently, the as-synthesized
NSHPC2 possessed a high specific surface area of 672.2
m2 g–1, exhibited a high specific capacitance
of 330.5 F g–1 at a current density of 0.5 A g–1, and a capacitance of 252 F g–1 even at a high current density of 10 A g–1 with
an excellent capacitance retention of 85.8% after 10 000 cycles.
Moreover, the assembled NSHPC2-based symmetric supercapacitor
displayed a high energy density of 43.6 Wh kg–1 at
a power density of 400 W kg–1. This work provides
a novel method to activate biomass to hierarchically porous carbons
for high-performance supercapacitors, expected to be applied to most
biomass, e.g., pine needles and orange leaves (Figure S8).

Experimental Section
Materials
Fresh
GLs were collected from Jiangsu University.
Ammonium nitrate (AN, 99%) was obtained from Xilong Scientific Corporation
(Guangdong, China). Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) emulsion (PTFE, 60 wt
%) and acetylene black were purchased from MTI Corporation (Shanghai,
China). Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt %) was purchased
from Alfa Aesar. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 95%), potassium
chloride (KCl, 99.8%), and methanol were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Corporation (Shanghai, China). All reagents were
used as received without further purification. Ultrapure water used
for all experiments was distilled through a Millipore Synergy water
purification system with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ.

Synthesis of
N/S-Codoped Hierarchically Porous Carbons (NSHPCs)
NSHPCs
were synthesized by pyrolysis of GLs with AN as the activator.
Briefly, fresh GLs were rinsed with distilled water, dried at 80 °C
for 36 h, ground to powder, and then sieved through 200 μm mesh.
The as-obtained (1 g) leaf powder was impregnated into 10 mL of aqueous
solution of AN (1.5 g) under sonication for 6 h, followed by drying
at 70 °C until a paste texture was obtained. The as-obtained
paste was put in a tube furnace for carbonization at 700 °C for
1 h with a heating ramp rate of 3 °C min–1 under
nitrogen flow. After cooling to room temperature, the black NSHPC
powder was washed with 1 mol L–1 HCl to remove foreign
ions and then washed with water until the filtrate reached a neutral
pH and subsequently dried at 80 °C. For clarity, the NSHPCs activated
at various temperatures of 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C are denoted
NSHPC-500, NSHPC-600, NSHPC-700, and NSHPC-800, respectively. The
NSHPC0, NSHPC1, NSHPC1.5, and NSHPC2 represent the NSHPCs synthesized by the reactants AN and
GL at mass ratios of 0, 1, 1.5, and 2, respectively, at a constant
carbonization temperature of 700 °C.

Material Characterizations
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental distributions
were obtained using a JEOL JSM-7001F field emission scanning electron
microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded
using a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope operated at
an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) were acquired using a Thermo ESCALAB250 X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Kα line source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Thermogravimetric/differential scanning
calorimetry (TG/DSC) analysis was performed using a Netzsch STA 449F3
TGA instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 in a N2 atmosphere. Raman spectra were collected using
a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope equipped with a diode laser
beam (532 nm, 1 mW) with an acquisition time of 10 s. The specific
surface area and pore volume were analyzed using a Micromeritics ASAP
2020 surface area and porosity analyzer and calculated via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda model, respectively.

Electrochemical Measurement
All electrochemical measurements
were carried out using a CHI 660E workstation (CH Instruments, China)
at room temperature. For the three-electrode system, a saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode, a platinum foil
served as the counter electrode, a nickel foam compressed with a homogeneous
slurry of the as-obtained carbon materials (80 wt %), poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE, 10 wt %), and acetylene black (10 wt %) served as the working
electrode, and a 6 mol L–1 KOH solution was used
as the electrolyte. The homogeneous slurry was painted onto a piece
of 1 cm × 4 cm nickel foam and vacuum-dried at 80 °C for
24 h. Subsequently, the nickel foam with slurry was pressed under
a pressure of 12 MPa. The mass of the as-obtained active carbon materials
used for each electrode was measured to be 4 mg. The potentials for
cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans were within the window from −1
to 0 V at various potential scanning rates in the range of 5–500
mV s–1. The average specific capacitances of the
electrodes can be calculated from the CV curves using the following
equations 6  where Cs is the
specific capacitance (F g–1), Sarea is the integral area of the entire CV loop, m is the mass of active materials (g), ν is the scan
rate (V s–1), and ΔV is the operation
voltage window (V).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out under
a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. The galvanostatic charge/discharge
(GCD) tests were performed at different current densities from 0.5
to 10 A g–1. The gravimetric specific capacitances
of the electrodes can be calculated depending on the galvanostatic
charge/discharge curves according to the following equation24 7  where Cs is the
specific capacitance (F g–1), I is the discharge current (A), Δt is the discharge
time (s), m is the mass of active materials (g),
and ΔV is the operation voltage window (V).

A test symmetrical supercapacitor was assembled with a polypropylene
membrane separating the two same nickel foam electrodes painted with
the NSHPC2, and a poly(vinyl alcohol)–KOH (PVA–KOH)
gel55 was used as a semisolid polymer electrolyte.
The PVA–KOH gel was prepared by adding 3.36 g of KOH to a viscous
solution containing 6 g of poly(vinyl alcohol) and 60 mL of water.
The energy density (E, Wh kg–1)
and power density (P, W kg–1) were
evaluated by the following equations 8   9
