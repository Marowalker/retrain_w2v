The development of nonprecious catalysts
for water splitting into
hydrogen and oxygen is one of the major challenges to meet future
sustainable fuel demand. Herein, thin layers of manganese oxide nanosheets
supported on nitrogen-functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) were
formed by the treatment of NCNTs dispersed in aqueous solutions of
KMnO4 or CsMnO4 under reflux or under hydrothermal
(HT) conditions and used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The samples were characterized by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Our results show that
the NCNTs treated under reflux were covered by partly amorphous and
birnessite-type manganese oxides, while predominantly crystalline
birnessite manganese oxide was observed for the hydrothermally treated
samples. The latter showed, depending on the temperature during synthesis,
an electrocatalytically favorable reduction from birnessite-type MnO2 to γ-MnOOH. OER activity measurements revealed a decrease
of the overpotential for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 from 1.70 VRHE for the bare NCNTs to 1.64
VRHE for the samples treated under reflux in the presence
of KMnO4. The hydrothermally treated samples afforded the
same current density at a lower potential of 1.60 VRHE and
a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec–1, suggesting that the
higher OER activity is due to γ-MnOOH formation. Oxidative deposition
under reflux conditions using CsMnO4 along with mild HT
treatment using KMnO4, and low manganese loadings in both
cases, were identified as the most suitable synthetic routes to obtain
highly active MnOx/NCNT catalysts for
electrochemical water oxidation.

1 Introduction
The
most efficient and sustainable method for storing renewable
energy is in chemical bonds, for instance, by producing molecular
hydrogen, an energy carrier with the highest gravimetric energy density.1−4 Thus, electrochemical water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is
a promising alternative complementary to other energy storage technologies.5 The bottleneck of electrochemical water splitting
is the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). From
the thermodynamic point of view, the standard potential to drive water
splitting is 1.23 V.6 However, much higher
anodic potentials have to be applied to achieve dioxygen formation
at a meaningful rate because of inevitable overpotentials.7 Therefore, lowering the overvoltage for water
splitting, particularly the overpotential of the OER, is one of the
most important goals in electrocatalysis research.8 Up to now, precious metal oxides, typically RuO2 and IrO2, are the best OER catalysts under acidic conditions,9,10 making them unappealing for large scale use. To reduce costs, the
development of nonprecious, highly abundant, and nontoxic electrocatalysts
is essential. Therefore, transition-metal oxides such as nickel oxide,
cobalt oxide, or manganese oxides have been widely investigated to
serve as OER catalysts under alkaline conditions.11 Inspired by the ability to evolve oxygen at a CaMn4O5 cluster in the natural protein complex photosystem
II, manganese oxide-based catalysts for the OER have been a topic
of intense investigation.12 The high abundance,
low toxicity, and unique redox properties of manganese render manganese-based
catalysts promising electrode materials.13

Most manganese oxides are built from differently connected
[MnO6] octahedra, leading to a multitude of Mn oxides/hydroxides
with different crystal structures.14 Numerous
manganese oxides have been synthesized and applied as OER electrocatalysts.15−21 It has been shown that many structural features of manganese oxides
such as the oxide phase, a large extent of di-μ-oxo ligands
within the oxide, and the simultaneous presence of Mn3+ and Mn4+ play a crucial role in influencing the electrocatalytic
performance of manganese oxides.22 It was
shown by Takashima et al.23,24 that high activities
can only be achieved in the presence of Mn3+. Therefore,
an alkaline environment becomes necessary because Mn3+ disproportionates
into Mn2+ and Mn4+ in acidic media. Huynh et
al.25 proposed a proton-coupled one-electron
transfer (PCET) pathway in alkaline media and a Mn3+ disproportionation
mechanism in acidic media. In the neutral regime, these two mechanisms
compete. It was shown by Jin et al.26,27 that Mn3+ might be stabilized on MnO nanoparticles, accompanied by
the occurrence of the PCET. However, Pokhrel et al.28 showed that the water oxidation activity of manganese oxides
strongly depends on the applied technique, that is, electrochemical,
chemical, or photochemical water oxidation, where α-MnO2 having a 2 × 2 tunnel structure is the most active bulk
manganese oxide for alkaline electrochemical water oxidation so far,
exhibiting a potential of 1.72 V at a current density of 10 mA cm–2. The OER performance of manganese oxides is diminished
by their low intrinsic electrical conductivity. This can be mitigated
by the deposition of MnOx nanoparticles
on carbon supports. It has recently been shown by Melder et al.29 that sp2-hybridized carbon is more
favorable than sp3 carbon, as it is less prone to carbon
corrosion. Therefore, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered
as promising catalyst support materials.

In previous studies,
doping CNTs with oxygen and nitrogen functional
groups improved the deposition and dispersion of metal oxide nanoparticles
because these groups act as strong anchoring sites.30−32 In addition,
it was shown that nitrogen doping increases the electrical conductivity.33 Different methods for MnOx deposition were applied, such as grinding of MnO2 with CNTs,34 impregnation and calcination
with Mn(NO3)235 or
Mn(CH3COOH)2,36 and
comproportionation of KMnO4 and Mn(NO3)2.37

Strong metal–support
interactions and the presence of thin
layers of manganese oxide are requirements for high electrocatalytic
activity.38,39 The most promising deposition method is
based on the method developed by Hummers and Offeman40 for the synthesis of graphite oxide using KMnO4. In accordance with this method, we aimed at thin layer deposition
of MnO2 through a redox reaction between CNTs and KMnO4, as described by eq 1 1  

Although this deposition technique has been investigated intensively
in the literature, it has not yet been applied for the synthesis of
MnOx/NCNT catalysts.29,41−44

In this study, we investigated the oxidative deposition of
manganese
oxides on NCNTs and their application in the OER. The deposition was
performed either by hydrothermal (HT) treatment or under reflux conditions
with different manganese loadings and using different precursors (CsMnO4 and KMnO4). For the hydrothermally deposited samples,
the effect of different HT treatment temperatures and duration on
the resulting MnOx structure and OER performance
was investigated. Furthermore, we addressed the influence of residual
CNT growth catalysts on their electrochemical performance by performing
extensive purification.

2 Results
2.1 Influence
of the Residual Growth Catalyst
on the Electrocatalytic Performance
Prior to the oxidative
deposition, the electrocatalytic behavior of the CNTs and the influence
of the purification method used to remove the residual growth catalysts
were investigated. The purification sequence involved partial oxidation
of the as-received CNTs in HNO3 vapor first (a′),
followed by purification in 1.5 M HNO3 (a″), or
vice versa, that is, washing the as-received CNTs in 1.5 M HNO3 first (b′) prior to the HNO3 vapor treatment
(b″). Figure 1 shows the influence of the pretreatment procedure on the OER activity
of the resulting materials.

Figure 1 Linear sweep OER voltammograms in O2-saturated KOH (1
M) at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 and a rotation speed
of 1600 rpm of the as-received CNTs, compared to the effect of different
pretreatment procedures consisting of (a) gas-phase HNO3 treatment followed by washing in 1.5 M nitric acid or (b) washing
as the first step followed by HNO3 treatment.

The as-received CNTs displayed the lowest activity,
achieving a
current density of 10 mA cm–2 at a potential of
1.85 V. After stirring the as-received CNTs in 1.5 M HNO3 (washing), the potential decreased to 1.68 V (b′) and further
to 1.60 V after 48 h HNO3 vapor treatment (b″).
When the as-received CNTs were first oxidized with HNO3 vapor (a′), the potential directly decreased to 1.60 V and
increased to 1.70 V after subsequent washing in 1.5 M HNO3 (a″). Elemental analysis was used to determine the content
of the residual growth catalysts. The as-received CNTs contained 1000
ppm Fe and 600 ppm Co, whereas Ni was not detected. The Fe and Co
content increased to 1800 and 900 ppm, respectively, after oxidation
in HNO3 vapor because of the carbon loss, and decreased
to fully encapsulated 400 ppm Fe and 100 ppm Co after washing the
OCNTs in 1.5 M HNO3. Therefore, the significantly more
efficient purification sequence involving partial oxidation of the
as-received CNTs in HNO3 vapor followed by washing in 1.5
M nitric acid was chosen for the subsequent investigations.

2.2 Bulk Characterization
2.2.1 Elemental Analysis
Elemental analysis
was applied to determine the manganese loading either after reflux
or after HT deposition. The samples having K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT
ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 yielded manganese loadings of 9.8 ±
0.1, 16.2 ± 0.2, and 23.3 ± 0.1 wt %, respectively, irrespective
of the deposition technique. Upon increasing the temperature to 140
°C and the treatment time to 24 h at 110 °C for the 1:1
ratio, the loading increased from 16.2 to 17.1 ± 0.1 wt %. A
further temperature increase to 180 °C led to an increase of
the manganese loading to 19.0 wt % because of carbon loss.

2.2.2 X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) Characterization
XRD
was applied to determine the manganese oxide phase after oxidative
deposition under the chosen conditions. Figure 2a shows the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized
under reflux conditions with the KMnO4/NCNT ratio varying
from 1:2 to 2:1, and a sample synthesized with CsMnO4 with
a CsMnO4/NCNT ratio of 1:1. Characteristic graphite reflections
at 25.9° (002) and 42.9° (100) were observed in all the
samples. The intensity of the (002) graphite reflection was found
to decrease with the KMnO4 content. The patterns show two
reflections, which can be assigned to birnessite-type manganese oxide,
one at 37.0° and the broad second one in the low 2θ region
between 5° and 15°. Although XRD patterns of layered manganese
oxides tend to be rather featureless because of poor long-range order,21 MnO2 with a birnessite structure
(JPCDS 42-1317) was identified. It can be seen that the reflection
in the low 2θ region of the sample synthesized with CsMnO4 is shifted to 8.0°, suggesting a higher interlayer distance
between the edge-sharing layers formed by the MnO6 octahedra.

Figure 2 XRD patterns
of the MnOx/NCNTs samples,
comparing (a) synthesis under reflux conditions using different K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios, (b) HT synthesis (110 °C; 8 h) with different
K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios, (c) HT synthesis at different temperatures
110 °C (for 8 and 24 h), 140 °C (8 h), and 180 °C (8
h) for a fixed KMnO4/NCNT ratio of 1:1, and (d) HT synthesis
with cesium and potassium at 110 and 140 °C (8 h).

Figure 2b–d
compares the XRD patterns of the MnOx/NCNT
samples obtained by oxidative deposition under HT conditions, with
(b) different loadings, (c) temperatures/durations, and (d) cations. Figure 2b exhibits reflections
similar to those of the reflux-treated samples, assigned to the graphitic
CNT structure and birnessite MnO2. The reflection in the
low 2θ region at 12.4° is comparatively sharper, indicating
higher crystallinity, whereas the sample having a 2:1 KMnO4/NCNT ratio shows only birnessite and CNT reflections, the samples
with a 1:1 ratio exhibit additional reflections in the 39°–42°
2θ range, attributed to the formation of γ-MnOOH (manganite).
For the sample synthesized with a 1:2 ratio, clear reflections in
the 34°–36°, 39°–42°, and 51°–55°
2θ range can be observed, which also suggest the formation of
γ-MnOOH. Figure 2c shows the XRD patterns of the hydrothermally treated samples obtained
at different temperatures and durations. The samples treated for 24
h at 110 °C and for 8 h at 140 °C exhibit reflections that
can be assigned to γ-MnOOH, while the sample treated for 8 h
at 180 °C manifested reflections ascribed to Mn3O4 as well as γ-MnOOH. The reflections appear to be relatively
sharp, indicating high crystallinity; meanwhile, the NCNT reflections
disappeared almost completely.

The use of CsMnO4 for
the HT deposition led to similar
observations as for the KMnO4-derived samples and its reflux
counterparts. Thus, the XRD pattern of the sample treated for 8 h
at 110 °C exhibited reflections characteristic of birnessite-type
MnO2. The low-angle reflection at 9° suggests a higher
interlayer distance as compared to the sample prepared with KMnO4. The treatment at 140 °C also led to the formation of
γ-MnOOH.

2.2.3 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
was applied to obtain information regarding the graphitic structure
of the NCNTs. Figure 3 shows a Raman spectrum of nitrogen-functionalized CNTs compared
with a representative Raman spectrum after oxidative MnOx deposition under reflux conditions. The spectrum
of the NCNTs contains bands located at 1577 cm–1 (G-band) and 1334 cm–1 (D-band) originating from
the Raman-active in-plane atomic displacement E2g mode
and disorder-induced features of the CNTs, respectively.45 Additionally, a band located at 2681 cm–1 is the overtone of the D band (2D band). The Raman
spectrum of the MnOx/NCNT sample shows
an upward shift of the G, D, and 2D bands to 1346, 1585, and 2692
cm–1, indicating that MnO2 is covalently
bound to the NCNTs. The upward shift was monitored for all samples
after MnOx deposition.

Figure 3 Representative Raman
spectra of NCNTs (dashed line) and MnOx/NCNT (bold line).

Because the XRD patterns
exhibited low crystallinity of the manganese
oxides, Raman spectra were recorded to provide further structural
information. Figure 4 displays the high-resolution Raman spectra in the range of 300 to
850 cm–1. Figure 4a shows the Raman spectra of the samples synthesized
under reflux conditions with the KMnO4/NCNT ratio varying
from 1:2 to 2:1 and a sample synthesized with CsMnO4 at
a ratio of 1:1. The spectra show three Raman bands located at 630,
571, and 495 cm–1. According to the literature,
the band at 630 cm–1 can be assigned to the symmetric
stretching vibration of Mn–O and the band at 570 cm–1 to the stretching vibration in the basal plane of MnO6 groups in birnessite-type MnO2.46

Figure 4 Raman
spectra of MnOx/NCNT samples,
comparing (a) synthesis under reflux conditions using different K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios, (b) HT synthesis (110 °C; 8 h) with different
K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios, (c) HT synthesis at different temperatures
110 °C (for 8 and 24 h), 140 °C (8 h), and 180 °C (8
h) for a fixed ratio of 1:1, and (d) HT synthesis with cesium or potassium
at 110 and 140 °C (8 h).

Figure 4b
depicts
the Raman spectra of the samples with different KMnO4/NCNT
ratios synthesized under HT conditions at 110 °C for 8 h. Clearly,
the samples with a higher Mn content show typical bands at 637, 573,
and 500 cm–1 related to birnessite-type MnO2. The sample with a 1:2 ratio shows multiple peaks between
480 and 700 cm–1 with superimposing bands, suggesting
the presence of at least two manganese oxide phases. Birnessite-type
bands are located at 630, 573, and 485 cm–1, while
γ-MnOOH bands are positioned at 530 and 558 cm–1.46,47 The band located at 659 cm–1 is attributed to traces of amorphous manganese oxide (AMO)48 or Mn3O4 impurities.49Figure 4c shows the Raman spectra of the samples derived from HT synthesis
at different temperatures and durations. It shows that upon heating
to 180 °C or increasing duration of the treatment at 110 °C
to 24 h, three bands in the high wavenumber region at 624, 558, and
524 cm–1 and two bands in the lower region at 386
and 358 cm–1 emerge. The bands can be assigned to
γ-MnOOH, in good agreement with the literature results.47 For the samples treated at 180 °C, a band
attributed to traces of Mn3O4 emerges at 659
cm–1.

By using CsMnO4 for the HT
deposition at 110 and 140
°C, similar inferences as those for the XRD observations in Figure 2d can be made for
the KMnO4-derived samples. The Raman spectra for the samples
treated at 110 °C show the three typical bands of birnessite-type
manganese oxide, while higher temperatures led to the formation of
γ-MnOOH. A small band at 660 cm–1 is also
noticeable in the 140 °C sample, which is assigned to traces
of Mn3O4.

2.3 Surface
Characterization
2.3.1 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
(XPS)
XPS was used to investigate the surface chemistry of
the samples
after oxidative deposition of MnOx on
NCNTs. Figure 5a–d
shows the Mn 3s region with the characteristic multiplet splitting
with one peak centered at 89.1 eV for all the samples.

Figure 5 Mn 3s XP spectra of MnOx/NCNT samples,
comparing (a) different K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios synthesized
under reflux conditions, (b) HT conditions (110 °C; 8 h) with
different K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios, (c) HT conditions applying
110 °C (for 8 and 24 h), 140 °C (8 h), and 180 °C (8
h) at a fixed ratio of 1:1, and (d) HT conditions with cesium or potassium
at 110 and 140 °C (8 h).

The energy separation of the multiplet splitting was used
to estimate
the average surface oxidation state. The samples synthesized under
reflux and HT conditions at 110 °C for 8 h with different ratios
show a splitting value of 5.1 eV (see Figure 5a,b), indicating an +4/+3 mixed oxidation
state, as it has been reported for birnessite-type MnO2.50 By increasing the temperature to 140
°C/180 °C and the treatment time at 110 °C to 24 h,
the splitting value increased to 5.2 and 5.7 eV (Figure 5b,c), respectively, for the
KMnO4-derived samples. The increase indicates a surface
reduction from the +4 to the +3 oxidation state. The CsMnO4-derived sample treated at 140 °C shows a splitting of 5.6 eV,
suggesting the presence of Mn3O4.

Figure 6 displays
the C 1s high-resolution spectra of the samples treated hydrothermally
at different temperatures and durations.

Figure 6 XPS C 1s region of the
samples treated under HT conditions at 110,
140, and 180 °C for 8 and 24 h.

The C 1s profile consists of a main peak at 284.5 eV originating
from sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon. Additionally, a shoulder
arises on the lower binding energy side upon increasing the treatment
time to 24 h at 110 °C. By increasing the temperature to 140
°C, the shoulder gets more pronounced, leading to a distinct
peak at 282.5 eV. The shoulder and the peak at 282.5 eV suggest the
formation of manganese carbide.

2.3.2 Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) were
applied to investigate the morphology
of the NCNTs and the MnOx species after
oxidative deposition under reflux and HT conditions.

Figure 7a,b shows the STEM
image and the corresponding EDS elemental mapping of manganese (green)
and carbon (red), clearly revealing that the multiwalled CNTs remain
intact with MnOx nanosheets randomly and
to some extent nonuniformly distributed on them. Figure 7c shows the TEM image of the
samples synthesized under reflux conditions with a 1:1 ratio of KMnO4/NCNT. Small and very thin crystalline MnOx nanosheets at the outer surface of the tubes can clearly be
seen. The sample synthesized with a higher KMnO4/NCNT ratio
of 2:1 (Figure 7d)
shows NCNTs with a higher surface coverage of MnOx nanoparticles having both crystalline and amorphous properties.

and elemental mapping (b) of the MnOx/NCNT
samples treated under HT conditions at 110 °C for
8 h with KMnO4 at a 1:1 (KMnO4/NCNT) ratio.

2.4 Electrochemical Characterization
2.4.1 Oxygen Evolution Reaction
Figure 8 shows iR-corrected linear
sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of the MnOx/NCNT samples during oxygen evolution in 1.0 M KOH.
To compare the activity, the potentials required to reach a current
density of i = 10 mA cm–2 are summarized
in Table S1. When comparing the OER performance
of the samples synthesized under reflux conditions with the bare NCNT
support, a decrease of the required potential from 1.70 to 1.64 V
is observed. Surprisingly, no evident activity trend was found as
a function of the KMnO4/NCNT ratio in spite of manganese
loadings ranging from 9.8 to 23.3 wt %, suggesting that an optimal
manganese oxide distribution is necessary to achieve an enhanced electrocatalytic
performance. When using CsMnO4, a further decrease of overpotential
down to 1.61 V is observed. The OER overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 for hydrothermally treated samples depended on the
applied temperature and treatment time. A decrease of the potential
required to reach 10 mA cm–2 was also observed for
the hydrothermally treated sample compared with blank NCNTs. Among
the hydrothermally treated samples, the sample treated for 8 h at
110 °C with the highest manganese loading exhibits a slightly
inferior performance, with 1.63 V at 10 mA cm–2.
By decreasing the KMnO4/NCNT ratio to 1:2, the potential
decreases to 1.62 V. An increase of the treatment time to 24 h at
110 °C and the temperature to 140 °C for 8 h led to a further
decrease to 1.61 and 1.60 V, respectively. The samples treated with
CsMnO4 at 140 °C and KMnO4 at 180 °C
reached overpotentials of 1.63 and 1.68 V, respectively.

Figure 8 Linear sweep
OER voltammograms in O2-saturated 1.0 M
KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 and a rotation speed
of 1600 rpm using (a) different K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios synthesized
under reflux conditions, (b) HT conditions (110 °C; 8 h) with
different K(Cs)MnO4/NCNT ratios, (c) HT conditions applying
110 °C (for 8 and 24 h), 140 °C (8 h), and 180 °C (8
h) at a fixed ratio of 1:1, and (d) HT conditions with CsMnO4 at 110 and 140 °C (8 h).

To explore the kinetics of the OER, Tafel analysis was performed. Figure 9 shows the Tafel
plots with the respective slopes of four selected samples derived
from the linear sweep voltammograms. The bare NCNTs exhibited the
highest slope (164 mV dec–1), which decreased to
91 and 99 mV dec–1 after deposition under reflux
conditions using KMnO4 and CsMnO4, respectively.
Lower Tafel slopes of 74 and 75 mV dec–1 were obtained
after applying HT conditions, indicating an improvement of the OER
kinetics. The barely visible semicircle in the Nyquist plot of the
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Figure S1) indicates that the conductivity of
the samples is very high. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements
were performed for the (K)MnOx/NCNT-reflux
sample with a 1:1 KMnO4/NCNT ratio to determine the faradaic
efficiency toward the OER. First, an LSV (Figure S2a) was recorded while simultaneously monitoring the ring
and disk currents. As can be seen in Figure S2a, in the potential region between 1.30 and 1.55 V, a current is measured
at the disk, while no O2 is detected at the ring. In the
higher potential regime (above 1.55 V), an oxygen reduction current
is detected at the ring, which increases with the disk current, indicating
that the OER occurs at the disk. A potential of 1.634 V versus RHE,
corresponding to a ring current of −0.5 mA cm–2, was selected for determining the faradaic efficiency because, as
seen in Figure S2a, it is high enough to
drive the OER, but not too high to cause turbulences due to bubble
formation, thus allowing collection of reliable faradaic efficiency
data. Figure S2b shows a chronoamperometric
measurement, where the ring current, the disk current, and the Faraday
efficiency are juxtaposed as a function of time, while potentials
of 1.184 and 1.634 V versus RHE were applied at the disk for 5 and
10 min, respectively, and a constant potential of 0.234 V was held
at the ring. Upon increasing the disk potential from 1.184 to 1.634
V versus RHE, a constant current of −0.5 mA cm–2 was monitored over 10 min at the ring. The disk current levels off
within the first 5 min, reaching a plateau, which corresponds to a
current density of approximately 1.84 mA cm–2. The
faradaic efficiency increased from 75 to 90% after 10 min. The initial
high disk current and low faradaic efficiency are ascribed to the
oxidation of manganese to higher oxidation states, which, after being
accomplished almost completely within 10 min, leads to a higher faradaic
efficiency.

a MnO4–/CNT ratio of 1:1 synthesized

110 °C (blue) and 140 °C (cyan) for 8 h.

3 Discussion
Depending
on the sequence of washing and oxidation, differences
in the electrocatalytic behavior of the manganese oxide-supported
NCNTs were observed. The as-received CNTs display a low activity because
of hydrophobic amorphous carbon present on the surface. Washing the
as-received CNTs prior to oxidation led to an improved performance,
as the amorphous carbon was removed. The further decrease of the potential
to 1.60 V after oxidation indicates that the removal of the residual
growth catalysts was not effective. Surface oxidation of the CNTs
by HNO3 vapor removes amorphous carbon layers and exposes
the residual growth catalyst, which then affects the OER. Washing
in 1.5 M HNO3 after oxidation results in the dissolution
of the residual growth catalyst and therefore leads to an increase
of the OER potential at 10 mA cm–2 to 1.70 V. The
decrease from 1800 to 400 ppm iron and from 900 to 100 ppm cobalt
detected by elemental analysis shows that it is more effective to
remove the residual growth catalysts by first applying HNO3 vapor oxidation followed by washing in HNO3. The residual
100 ppm cobalt is assumed to be fully embedded in the NCNTs and hence
does not participate in the OER. The contribution of iron to the measured
OER can be excluded because it is known to be an inefficient OER catalyst.51 NCNTs were used as a substrate because previous
studies had shown that N-related defect sites are chemically more
active and, therefore, interacting more strongly with precursor molecules.52−54 A detailed deconvolution of the high-resolution XP O 1s and N 1s
spectra before and after nitrogen functionalization is shown in Figure S3.

The bulk structure of the support
and the deposited MnOx species were investigated
by XRD and Raman spectroscopy.
The shift of the D, G, and 2D Raman bands to slightly higher wave
numbers indicates that the manganese oxide species are covalently
bound to the NCNTs as a result of the oxidative deposition introducing
surface defects in the carbon structure (eq 1). The STEM and TEM images show that the MnOx nanosheets are evenly distributed on the
NCNTs at 16.2 wt % Mn loading and suggest an increase of the layer
thickness for a Mn loading of 23.3 wt %. Table S2 lists the surface concentration of the elements derived
from the XPS regions, where birnessite-type MnO2 nanosheet
formation was observed. The hydrothermally derived samples generally
exhibited higher manganese surface concentrations, indicating a higher
dispersion. However, the manganese surface concentration does not
increase linearly with loading, indicating that a higher loading led
to an increase of the MnOx nanosheet thickness
rather than a higher coverage on the NCNTs. The XRD and XPS results
identify birnessite-type MnO2 containing Mn4+/3+ for the deposition under reflux and HT conditions at 110 °C
for 8 h. Temperature increase during HT deposition led to partial
reduction from the 4+ to the 3+ oxidation state. The XRD reflections
of the reflux-derived samples are rather broad, indicating low crystallinity.
The reflection in the low 2θ region can be utilized to estimate
the interlayer distance between the birnessite sheets, which ranges
from 7.8 to 9.5 Å in the KMnO4-derived reflux samples.
Compared with the unsupported K-birnessite, which has an interlayer
distance of 7.03 Å according to JPCDS database 42-1317, the KMnO4-derived samples exhibited comparatively larger interlayer
distances, probably because of a higher amount of hydrate water between
the layers. The CsMnO4-derived sample shows a larger distance
of about 10.5 Å owing to the intercalation of Cs ions between
the birnessite sheets. The hydrothermally deposited samples with a
birnessite structure exhibit a sharper reflection around 12.2°,
which corresponds to an interlayer distance of 7.2 Å. The CsMnO4 sample synthesized under HT conditions at 110 °C again
shows a higher distance of 9.5 Å.

Raman spectroscopy demonstrates
an improved signal-to-noise ratio
for the hydrothermally derived samples compared with the reflux-derived
samples. Specifically, the intensity of the band at 575 cm–1 is more pronounced for the hydrothermally treated samples. Because
this band relates to the layered structure of birnessite, structural
degradation during the reflux treatment could have taken place.55 This observation further confirms that the reflux-derived
samples have a lower degree of crystallinity. The Raman spectra of
the HT treated samples at 180 °C, at 110 °C with a KMnO4 to NCNT ratio of 1:2, and the 140 °C CsMnO4-derived sample show a band located at 660 cm–1. Both amorphous MnOx and Mn3O4 exhibit a band at this wavenumber. For the KMnO4 1:2 sample, it is likely that AMO is formed when using lower
Mn loadings on the NCNT support because lower loadings favor the formation
of AMO.41 However, the possibility that
MnO2 is partially reduced to Mn3O4 (which is more Raman-active) during spectra acquisition cannot be
ruled out. In contrast, for the CsMnO4-derived samples,
Mn3O4 is the likely species because the XRD
results (Figure 2d)
contain reflections at 36.0° and 32.5° 2θ corresponding
to Mn3O4.

The different deposition techniques
did not affect the structure
of the CNT support. The features and intensities of the D and G bands
remain essentially unchanged after MnOx deposition under reflux and HT conditions (Figure S4). The samples treated under HT conditions at a temperature
of 140 and 180 °C or 24 h at 110 °C cannot be considered
as homogenous depositions of MnOx on the
NCNTs because large discrepancies were observed in the intensities
of the D and G bands depending on the illuminated spot (see Figure S5). Further, Figure S6 shows the presence of needle-like γ-MnOOH crystals
and NCNTs after the HT treatment at 140 °C. Additional evidence
for minor degradation of the NCNT support associated with the reduction
of Mn4+/3+O2 to γ-Mn3+OOH is
indicated by the increase in the Mn content to 17.1 and 19.0 wt %
after HT treatment for 24 h at 110 °C and for 8 h at 180 °C,
respectively.

Comparing the Raman spectroscopy, XRD, and the
XPS results leads
to the conclusion that the deposition under reflux and HT conditions
at 110 °C for 8 h resulted mainly in the formation of birnessite-type
MnO2 with a mixed-valent surface oxidation state of +4/+3.
Increase of the temperature and duration of the treatment leads to
partial reduction of the bulk and the surface species from δ-Mn4+/3+O2 to γ-Mn3+OOH and Mn33+/2+O4 (see eq 2), as indicated by the XRD reflections of
γ-MnOOH and Mn3O4 and the Mn 3s multiplet
splitting of 5.2 and 5.7 eV, respectively. 2  

The OER results show an improvement because
of the oxidative deposition
under reflux conditions manifested by a decrease of the OER potential
at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 from 1.70 to
1.64 V with respect to the bare NCNTs. The potential necessary to
reach a current density of 10 mA cm–2 further decreased
to 1.61 V when using CsMnO4. The higher activity is presumably
caused by the higher interlayer distance of the birnessite layers,
as reported in the literature.56 The same
trend is observed for the hydrothermally derived samples using CsMnO4. For the hydrothermally derived samples, a weak correlation
between the OER activity and low manganese loadings was observed.
It is expected that the lower Mn loading favors the formation of γ-Mn3+OOH, as revealed by the XRD patterns and the Raman spectroscopy
data, which is beneficial for electrocatalysis of the OER. Dismukes
et al.47 reported that γ-MnOOH is
a better performing OER catalyst than layered MnOx. This observation is further supported by the high OER activity
of the samples formed by HT treatment for 24 h at 110 and 140 °C
for 8 h, where γ-MnOOH formation was observed. These samples
afforded 10 mA cm–2 at low potentials of 1.60 and
1.61 V, among the lowest attained, and exhibited lower Tafel slopes
compared to the KMnO4 reflux-derived samples. HT treatment
at 180 °C led to further reduction to Mn3O4 as well the formation of manganese carbide, accompanied by the increase
of the OER potential (at 10 mA cm–2) to 1.68 V.
Thus, oxidative deposition under reflux conditions (100 °C) using
CsMnO4 and mild HT treatment (110–140 °C) using
KMnO4, and low manganese loadings in both cases, resulted
in the most active MnOx/NCNT catalysts
for electrochemical water oxidation among the studied samples. The
Faraday efficiency increased with time during polarization of the
disk at 1.634 V reaching 90% after 10 min, indicating that within
the first minutes, the disk current has a significant contribution
from the oxidation of manganese to higher oxidation states. The long-term
stability of MnOx/NCNT obtained by HT
treatment with a 1:1 (KMnO4/NCNT) ratio at 140 °C
was investigated chronoamperometrically at a potential of 1.65 V versus
RHE for 2 h (see Figure S7). The current
decreased continuously with a higher initial slope, dropping from
9 mA cm–2 to below 4 mA cm–2 within
the first 30 min, reaching 1 mA cm–2 after 2 h,
which may be caused by catalyst detachment.

Further studies
employing operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy
are in progress to elucidate structural changes of the deposited MnOx nanosheets under applied potential.

4 Conclusions
The oxidative deposition of manganese oxide
on nitrogen-doped CNTs
under reflux and HT conditions using KMnO4 and CsMnO4 was applied to obtain MnOx/NCNT
composites for the electrocatalytic OER. The deposition under reflux
conditions led to the formation of birnessite-type MnO2 with a partly amorphous character covalently bound on the NCNTs.
TEM and STEM showed that the manganese oxide nanosheets were evenly
distributed on the NCNTs. The optimized MnOx/NCNT catalyst formed by reflux treatment afforded a current
density of 10 mA cm–2 at a 60 mV lower overpotential
(1.64 V) compared to the purified NCNTs (1.70 V), and exhibited a
significantly lower Tafel slope of 91 mV dec–1 in
relation to 164 mV s–1 for the NCNTs. The optimal
hydrothermally treated sample required 100 mV lower potential to achieve
the same current density and had a lower Tafel slope of 75 mV dec–1. XRD, XPS, and Raman results showed that bulk and
surface reduction from birnessite MnO2 to γ-MnOOH
took place when the temperature or duration time was increased beyond
110 °C or 8 h, respectively, during the HT synthesis. The oxidative
deposition under reflux conditions using CsMnO4 along with
mild HT treatment using KMnO4 and low manganese loadings
in both cases were identified as the most suitable synthetic routes
to obtain highly active MnOx/NCNT catalysts
for electrochemical water oxidation.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Synthesis of CsMnO4
KMnO4 (1.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.02 g of CsCl (Sigma-Aldrich)
were dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water and heated to 65 °C.
After cooling, the solution was kept at room temperature overnight.
Green/bronze-colored crystals (0.95 g) were separated from the solution
by filtering. The crystals were recrystallized once by dissolving
0.95 g of CsMnO4 in 80 mL of deionized water, heating to
65 °C and subsequent cooling to room temperature overnight. After
filtering, 0.68 g of CsMnO4 crystals was obtained. XRD
reflections (Figure S8) agree well with
those reported for CsMnO4 (ICSD: 01-070-3167).

5.2 Sample Preparation
CNTs with an average
diameter of 9 nm and a length of 1.5 μm were obtained from NANOCYL
SA (Sambreville, Belgium). The as-received CNTs (2 g) were treated
with HNO3 (65%, Sigma-Aldrich) vapor for 48 h at 200 °C
and then dried overnight at 80 °C to obtain oxygen-functionalized
CNTs (OCNTs).57 The OCNTs were purified
by washing in 1.5 M HNO3 under continuous stirring for
72 h at room temperature. The suspensions were filtered, washed with
deionized water to a pH of 7, and dried overnight at 80 °C to
obtain purified OCNTs. In order to produce nitrogen-functionalized
CNTs (NCNTs), 500 mg of the OCNTs was thermally treated for 6 h at
400 °C with 10% NH3 in He (99.999% purity, Air Liquide)
at a flow rate of 50 sccm.

For the oxidative deposition under
reflux conditions, 100 mg of NCNTs was mixed with KMnO4 (50, 100, or 200 mg) in 30 mL of water in a 50 mL round bottom flask.
CsMnO4 (160 mg) was used in order to have the same manganese
loading as compared to the 100 mg KMnO4 sample. The mixture
was stirred for 5 min and ultrasonicated for 5 min. Afterward, the
mixture was heated to 100 °C for 1 h and stirred for additional
20 h at room temperature. Finally, the product was filtered, washed
several times with water, and dried at 80 °C overnight. The HT
deposition was performed in the same way, except using a 50 mL Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was then put in an oven and
heated to 110, 140, or 180 °C for 8 h and later for 24 h at 110
°C.

5.3 Characterization
Raman spectroscopy
was performed using a Jobin Yvon iHR550 (HORIBA) spectrometer equipped
with a 532 nm laser source (Ventus 532, Laser Quantum). A laser power
of 1 mW was used for all the measurements. Gratings of 600 and 1800
grooves/mm were used for low and high resolution, respectively. XRD
patterns were recorded using a PANalytical theta–theta powder
diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation in the 2θ range
of 10°–80°. The obtained XRD patterns were analyzed
by the PANalytical X’Pert HighScore Plus v.3.0 software. XPS
measurements were carried out in an ultrahigh vacuum setup equipped
with a high-resolution Gammadata-Scienta SES 2002 analyzer. A monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source (1486.3 eV; anode operating at 14.5 eV and
30.5 mA) was used as incident radiation and a pass energy of 200 eV
was chosen, resulting in an energy resolution better than 0.5 eV.
Charging effects were compensated using a flood gun. Binding energies
were calibrated by positioning the main C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. TEM
was performed using a JEM-2800 (JEOL) transmission electron microscope
operated at 200 kV. Elemental analysis was performed by atomic absorption
spectroscopy using a Varian AA 300 spectrometer equipped with a flame
ionization system.

The electrocatalytic tests were performed
in a conventional three-electrode cell controlled by an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat
(PGSTAT128 N) in combination with a Metrohm RDE-2 rotator and its
control unit. The measurements were performed using the control software
Nova 1.10. A Hg/HgO electrode and a platinum wire served as the reference
electrode (RE) and the counter electrode (CE), respectively. Polished
glassy carbon (GC) disc electrodes (diameter: 3.8 mm) embedded in
a Teflon cylinder were employed as working electrodes (WEs). The catalyst
suspension was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the catalyst
(5.0 mg) in a mixture of water (490 mL), ethanol (490 mL), and Nafion
(5%, 20 mL). The resulting catalyst suspension (5.0 μL) was
drop-cast onto a polished GC electrode to obtain a catalyst loading
of 210 μg cm–2. The modified electrode was
dried in air at room temperature for at least 30 min. Prior to measurements,
the electrolyte (1 M KOH) was purged with pure O2 for 20
min to reach O2 saturation. Each measurement started with
cyclic voltammetry performed between 1.0 and 1.5 V versus RHE with
a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1. Twenty cycles were applied
as conditioning to achieve reproducible voltammograms. To determine
the solution resistance, EIS measurements were performed at open circuit
potential. The spectra were recorded between 50 kHz and 10 Hz with
a 10 mV amplitude. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed at a scan
rate of 5 mV s–1. Long-term stability measurements
were performed chronoamperometrically by maintaining the potential
at 1.65 V versus RHE for 2 h. To mitigate the inhibition by O2 bubbles during the OER, the electrode was rotated at 1600
rpm.

Faradaic efficiency measurements were performed by means
of RRDE
voltammetry in a four-electrode cell configuration, where the disk,
GC (A = 0.1963 cm2), modified with 8.31
μL catalyst ink, served as WE 1, and a concentric platinum ring
(A = 0.1532 cm2) was WE 2. A Pt mesh and
a Hg/HgO electrode were used as the CE and the RE, respectively. The
measurements were conducted in Ar-saturated 1 M KOH solution. An LSV
was recorded at the modified disk electrode from 0.934 to 1.684 V
versus RHE at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 and 1600 rpm
rotation speed; meanwhile, a constant potential of 0.234 V versus
RHE was applied at the ring to reduce the produced O2 at
a diffusion-limited rate. From the resulting LSV, the disk potential
at which a current of −0.5 mA cm–2 was obtained
at the ring was determined. Subsequently, a chronoamperometric protocol
was used consisting of, firstly, applying a constant potential of
1.184 V for 5 min on the disk, and secondly, stepping the previously
determined potential for 10 min, while maintaining a constant potential
of 0.234 V at the ring. The faradaic efficiency was determined according
to % FE = (iring/(idisk·N))·100; where iring and idisk are the currents
measured at the ring and at the disk, respectively, and N is the collection efficiency factor. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)
(5 mM, K3[Fe(CN)6]) dissolved in 1 M KOH was
used to determine N by reducing Fe(III) to Fe(II) at the disk and
oxidizing reduced Fe(II) back to Fe(III) at the ring. N was determined
from the relation N = iring/idisk and had a value of 24% for the
investigated catalyst film.
