In this work, a highly selective
and sensitive method has been
developed for the detection of trinitrophenol (TNP), which is a dangerous
explosive. For this purpose, N and P co-doped carbon dots (NP-Cdots)
have been used. Synthesis of N and P co-doped carbon dots has been
carried out by a simple and quick method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
analysis was carried out to detect the doping of N and P. These carbon
dots are insoluble in water (inNP-Cdots). These carbon dots were functionalized
by treating them with conc. HNO3 so that they become water-soluble
(wsNP-Cdots). These dots were characterized by different analytical
techniques such as IR, UV–vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy.
The as-prepared wsNP-Cdots have good fluorescence properties. The
average diameter of wsNP-Cdots is found to be 5.7 nm with an interlayer
spacing (d-spacing) of 0.16 nm. The as-prepared wsNP-Cdots
are highly sensitive and selective toward TNP, as observed using a
fluorescence quenching technique. The quenching constant for TNP is
found to be very high (8.06 × 104 M–1), which indicates its high quenching ability. The limit of detection
is found to be 23 μM.

1 Introduction
Nitro aromatic compounds
are widely used in present-day military
explosives.1,2 These nitro containing compounds have widespread
applications in military explosives over the last 100 years.3 Commonly used nitroexplosive ingredients are
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(TNP).4,5 TNT is the most demonstrative nitro aromatic
compound,6,7 while DNT is volatile and soluble and used
as an intermediate for the synthesis of TNT.8,9 TNP
has extraordinary explosive power, and it is used in a variety of
different industries such as fireworks, matches, dyes, leather, and
glass. It is widely recognized as a toxic pollutant, and it also possess
mutagenic properties as it transforms into picramic acid (2-amino-4,6-dinitrophenol).10 They are also used in industrial explosives
and often found in a land which is unexploded.5 They can be soaked into land water and then mix and pollute the
sea.11,12 These contaminations may lead to adverse
effects on humans, such as anemia; liver function disabilities; and
discoloration of hair, skin, and nails, and so forth.13,14

Therefore, the detection of these explosives has become the
most
challenging duty in daily life as it concerns with homeland safety,
forensic research, and military applications.15 Reported methods for qualitative and quantitative analysis of different
nitro aromatics includes high-performance liquid chromatography,16,17 gas chromatography,16 Raman spectroscopy,18 mass spectrometry,19 and electrochemical techniques.20,21 These methods
require sophisticated instruments that are difficult, having transportability
issues and are expensive.22 Nowadays, carbon
nanomaterials are used widely as sensor materials as they have good
conducting, fluorescent, and electrical properties. Sarkar and co-workers
have used different types of fluorescent carbon nanomaterials for
the detection of DNA,23 glucose,24 chromium ions,25 and
cholesterol26 and imaging the life cycle
of Drosophila melanogaster.27

Explosives are nonfluorescent and their
detection using a fluorescence
sensing technique is difficult. However, when they are combined with
carbon nanomaterials, fluorescence quenching of carbon nanomaterials
takes place and therefore the presence of explosives can be noticed.
In the literature, such types of detection of explosives have been
reported by some researchers.28−30 Carbon nanomaterials are used
for the detection of TNT by fluorescence and electrochemical methods
in the aqueous phase.31 Carbon nanomaterials
have no toxic effects and have high solubility in water.32,33 Therefore, improvement of optical properties of carbon nanomaterials
is very important. For this purpose, nitrogen and phosphorous doping
in carbon nanomaterials is carried out. Therefore, easy and quick
synthesis of N- and P-doped carbon nanomaterials is a key requirement.
Many reports have reported N doping to carbon nanotubes, graphene,
and carbon nanoparticles.34−36 However, different defects were
observed in N-doped C-dots such as frail resistance to the metal ion
interface and low-stable decentrality in water.37,38 To overcome this defects, P is frequently used to dope in N-doped
C-dots.39 In few reports, phosphoric acid
has been used with aliphatic amine/NH3·H2O for the doping of P and N in C-dots.40,41 In another
case, the use of 1,2 diethylenediamine has been reported as an N-dopant,
whereas phosphoric acid was used as a P-dopant.39 Later, the N and P dual doped C-dots were used to detect
Cr(VI)42 and Fe3+ ions43,44 under low concentration and for drug delivery.40 Hence, easy and quick synthesis of N- and P-doped carbon
nanomaterials is important.

Herein, we report the easy and quick
method for the synthesis of
N and P co-doped NP-Cdots. Dextrose is used as a carbon source, liq.
NH3 is used as N source, and P2O5 is used as the source of P. As-prepared NP-Cdots are insoluble in
water; however, after treatment with conc. HNO3, they become
water soluble. wsNP-Cdots have good fluorescence properties, and they
have high selectivity toward nitro explosives, TNP. In order to define
an ideal sensor, several parameters such as high selectivity, water
solubility, reasonable sensitivity, and low toxicity need to be fulfilled.
The proposed sensor has high selectivity, reasonable sensitivity,
water solubility, and low toxicity.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Chemicals and Instrumentation
TNT
and RDX were donated by HEMRL Pune, India. Other nitro derivatives
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Nitrate and acetate salts of different
metal ions were purchased from SD fine chemicals. Distilled water
was used throughout the experiment. The PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrometer
was used to record the IR spectra of inNP-Cdots and wsNP-Cdots in
the range of 4000–400 cm–1. For the absorption
spectra of TNP, a UV-2450 PC Shimadzu UV–Vis spectrophotometer
was used. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were
carried out on AXIS Supra, Kratos Analytical, UK. For transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, Philips TEM CM 200 was used with
operating voltages ranging between 20 and 200 kV, while for high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM), field emission gun-transmission electron microscope 300
kV, Tecnai G2, F30 with accelerating potential 300 kV was used. All
fluorescence studies were carried out using an RF-5301PC Shimadzu
Spectrofluorophotometer at 298 K. Merck silica gel 60 F254 thin layer
chromatography (TLC) plates were used for the live application of
wsNP-Cdots. Fluorescence decay was recorded by a Delta Flex time-correlated
single-photon counting technique using 350 nm excitation light with
full-width half maximum of instrument response function 77 ps. A photomultiplier
hybrid (PMT-hybrid) was used as a detector to monitor the emitting
photons through a monochromator. All the fluorescence decay collected
at an emission polarizer were set at a magic angle (54.7°) to
avoid the effect of rational relaxation of the molecule on the observed
decay. Emission decays were fit by IRF (Instrument Response Function)
which is collected by the ludox solution. Decay spectra fitted by
using Ez time software through an iterative deconvolution method  where I0 and I′t are the photoluminescence
intensity at t = 0 and t = t, respectively, τ is the lifetime, and ai is the amplitude of the ith component.

2.2 Synthesis of inNP-Cdots
In a typical
synthesis, 3 mL of saturated solution of dextrose in aq. NH3 was added dropwise to 1 g of P2O5. The reaction
is highly exothermic, and a black mass is obtained. Further addition
of water subsidizes the reaction. Then, the reaction mixture is centrifuged
to collect inNP-Cdots. It is then washed with distilled water for
several times and dried in an oven.

2.3 Synthesis
of wsNP-Cdots
wsNP-Cdots
were synthesized using a previously reported method.45 In a typical synthesis, to 500 mg of inNP-Cdots, 100 mL
40% conc. HNO3 solution was added. The resultant mixture
was then refluxed for 6 h. After that nitric acid solution was decanted
off. The residue obtained was centrifuged and dried on a water bath.
The black mass was again redissolved in water and kept on a water
bath (100 °C) till dryness. The same procedure was carried out
till the traces of nitric acid get removed. The final black mass was
dried and used for further analysis. A graphical illustration is shown
in Scheme 1.

2.4 Detection of TNP
The detection of
TNP was carried out at room temperature using a fluorescence quenching
technique. For the detection of TNP, first, a stock solution of wsNP-Cdots
was prepared by adding 5 mg of wsNP-Cdots to 100 mL of distilled water.
Then, 10 μL of TNP (1 × 10–2 M) solution
was added to the 2 mL stock solution, and the emission intensity at
340 nm was observed. A constant volume of TNP (10 μL) was added
gradually to the same solution to examine further quenching of wsNP-Cdots.
For comparison, 10 μL of other nitro explosives (1 × 10–2 M) and metal ions (1 × 10–2M) were added to the 2 mL stock solution of wsNP-Cdots, and the emission
intensity at 340 nm was checked.

3 Result
and Discussion
3.1 IR Spectroscopy
To check the surface
functionalization of the prepared wsNP-Cdots, IR spectroscopy was
used. The IR spectra of inNP-Cdots and wsNP-Cdots are shown in Figure 1. In the inNP-Cdots
spectrum, the peak at 1608 cm–1 corresponds to the
C=C stretching frequency and the peak around 3000 cm–1 corresponds to O–H stretching. In inNP-Cdots and wsNP-Cdots,
the peak observed at 1703 cm–1 corresponds to the
C=O stretching frequency but having different intensity. The
increase in the intensity of peak at 1703 and 3000 cm–1 relative to inNP-Cdots clearly indicates the presence of carboxylic
and hydroxy groups on the surface of wsNP-Cdots, leading to the formation
of defects on the surface. Because of these surface defects, the wsNP-Cdots
become water soluble.27,33,45 The peaks observed at 1436 and 879 cm–1 could
to be attributed to C–P and P–O–C bonds.46

3.2 Morphological Studies
The morphology
of NP-Cdots was investigated by TEM and HRTEM microscopy. TEM images
of inNP-Cdots are shown in Figure 2a,b. The presence of particles in the cluster form
can be seen in the image. However, a close observation reveals the
formation of somewhat spherical particles. The HRTEM images of wsNP-Cdots
are shown in Figure 2c,d. Distinct uniform spherical particles of wsNP-Cdots can be seen
in these images. The average size of wsNP-Cdots is found to be 5.7
nm. The maximum number of wsNP-Cdots ranges between 5 and 7 nm in
size. The HRTEM image of such wsNP-Cdots shows the presence of layers,
and the interlayer spacing (d-spacing) is found to
be 0.16 nm (Figure 2d) which is characteristics of such materials.47,48

with an interplanar distance in wsNP-Cdots.

3.3 XPS Analysis
XPS is an important
tool to detect the presence of elements present in a material. Figure 3 shows the XPS spectrum
of the inNP-Cdots. The presence of four elements, namely, C, O, N,
and P in the material is observed, which confirms the doping of N
and P in the Cdots. High-resolution peak fitting of C1S (Figure 3b) shows
that three prominent peaks corresponds to three binding states. The
peak at 283.6 eV corresponds to C=C, and the peak at 285.2
eV corresponds to C–OH binding states. The peak at 284.7 eV
is attributed to C–C/C–P, which confirms the bonding
between C and P. In O1S high-resolution spectrum (Figure 3c), binding states
observed at 530.5, 530.7, and 531.9 eV are ascribed to O=C–O,
O=P, and O–P respectively. Figure 3d shows high-resolution peak fitting of N1S revealing three prominent peaks viz. 393.3, 398.7, and 401.1
eV. The peak at 393.3 eV corresponds to pyloric like N and peak 398.7
eV corresponds to pyridinic like N, which confirms the two different
states of N.39 The peak at 401.1 eV corresponds
to graphitic N.49,50 Two different peaks observed
in the XPS spectrum at 130.1 and 190.5 eV can be attributed to P2P (Figure 3e) and P2S (Figure 3f), respectively. High-resolution peak fitting of P2P shows two prominent peaks at 131.1 and 133.9 eV, which corresponds
to P2p3/2 and P–C, respectively, while P2S shows only one prominent peak at 190.5 eV.46

3.4 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
In the
detection of any analyte, optical properties play a very important
role. When excited at different wavelengths wsNP-Cdots emit light
at different wavelengths with different intensity. wsNP-Cdots has
a wide range of fluorescence excitation wavelengths. When excited
at 280–540 nm with an increment of 20 nm, it shows photoluminescence
at every wavelength (Figure 4). High fluorescence emission intensity is observed when excited
at a wavelength of 380 nm. The fluorescence observed in these particles
is due to the extensive surface derivatization through carboxylic
and hydroxy groups. When inNP-Cdots treated with conc. HNO3, defects were formed on the surface of inNP-Cdots which leads to
their solubilization in water. The high density of carboxylic groups
on the surface of wsNP-Cdots leads to quantum confinement and surface
passivation. Because of this wsNP-Cdots has a wide range of fluorescence
through the visible area (280–540 nm).27,45,51 The other possible mechanism for such luminescence
is radiative combination of excitations.52−54

range of 280–540 nm with an increment of 20 nm. Inset—solution

3.5 Detection of TNP
Solution-based fluorescence
quenching experiments were carried out for the detection of TNP in
aqueous medium. Figure 5a shows the fluorescence spectra of wsNP-Cdots and TNP—wsNP-Cdots
under the same experimental conditions, and Figure 5b exhibits the corresponding Stern–Volmer
(SV) plot. When excited at 340 nm wsNP-Cdots gives a strong emission
at 452 nm. When TNP (1 × 10–2 M) was added
to the solution of wsNP-Cdots (0.05 mg/mL), the quenching of fluorescence
occurs (Figure 5a).
Even after quenching of the wsNP-Cdots, there is no change in emission
wavelength. Sequential fluorescence quenching titrations were carried
out by constant addition of nitro explosives. Fast and high quenching
occurs during the quenching titrations.

of the wsNP-Cdots with the addition
of the TNP. (b) SV plot.

By adding 10 μL
solution of TNP (1 × 10–2 M) to the wsNP-Cdots
(0.05 mg/mL) solution, 69.56% quenching occurs
(Figure 6), which is
very high compared to other nitro explosives and metal ions. Great
selectivity observed for TNP among other nitro explosives, namely,
TNT, RDX, 2,6-DNT, 2,4-DNT, DMDNB, nitromethane, and metal ions such
as Zn+2, Ni+2, Co+2, Cu+2, Pb+2, Cd+2, Na+, Ba+2, and Fe+2 (1 × 10–2 M) (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Quenching efficiency
of TNP compared to other nitro explosives
and metal ions.

Furthermore, the fluorescence
quenching efficiency of TNP was determined
by using the SV plot. The SV plot of I0/I versus concentration of the analyte is shown
in Figure 7. It is
plotted for titrations in the range of 100–300 μM. The
SV plot is linear and gives 0.9861 correlation coefficient (R2). The quenching constant and sensitivity were
calculated by using eqn I0/I = 1 + KSV [TNP],55,56 where I0 and I are
the fluorescence intensities of wsNP-Cdots before and after the addition
of TNP, KSV is quenching constant, and
[TNP] is molar concentration of TNP. Using this equation, the quenching
constant has been estimated to be 8.06 × 104 M–1. The calculated quenching constant is very high which
indicates the quenching ability of wsNP-Cdots toward TNP is very good.55 The detection limit (LOD) is calculated by the
formula, LOD = 3σ/k, where σ is the standard
deviation of blank sample and k is slope of the SV
plot. Using this equation, the LOD is found to be 23 μM.

Figure 7 SV plot of
the quenching of wsNP-Cdots in the presence of TNP.

To examine the interference study, it is better to check
the quenching
response of wsNP-Cdots toward TNP in the presence of other nitro explosives
and metal ions. Figure 8 shows the sequential quenching intensity of TNP in the presence
of other analytes. After the addition of other analytes (10 μL,
1 × 10–2 M) to the solution of wsNP-Cdots (2
mL, 0.05 mg/mL), there is no such quenching in the fluorescence intensity,
but after the addition of TNP (10 μL, 1 × 10–2 M) to the same solution, quenching is initiated. The stepwise reduction
in fluorescence intensity clearly indicates the high sensitivity of
the wsNP-Cdots toward TNP even in the presence of other nitro explosives
and metal ions.

Figure 8 Fluorescence quenching of wsNP-Cdots in the presence of
different
nitro explosives and metals ions using TNP.

To recognize the selectivity and quenching mechanism of wsNP-Cdots
toward TNP, different mechanisms such as photoinduced electron transfer
and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was considered.
As the SV plot is nonlinear (Figure 5b), it is indicated that the mechanism is through FRET,
not by photoinduced electron transfer.56 The resonance energy transfer only occurs when the absorbance band
of the analyte and emission band of the fluorophore has an effective
overlap, and both the analyte and fluorophore are adjacent.57 The resonance energy transfer plays an effective
role in fluorescence quenching along with the improvement in sensitivity.56,58 From Figure 9a, it
is clearly seen that there is overlap between the both spectrums (emission
band of the fluorophore and absorbance band of the analyte). The quenching
mechanism is explained in Figure 9b. Upon excitation, wsNP-Cdots gives fluorescence but
in the presence of the TNP, it transfers the fluorescence resonance
energy to TNP. TNP absorbs it, and quenching in fluorescence occurs.

Figure 9 (a) Emission
spectrum of wsNP-Cdots and absorption spectrum of
TNP shows high extent of overlap and (b) fluorescence quenching mechanism
of wsNP-Cdots in the presence of TNP.

To confirm the FRET mechanism, we measured the fluorescence lifetime
of wsNP-Cdots in the presence and absence of TNP. Figure 10 displays fluorescence decay
profiles of wsNP-Cdots, which shows overlapping of fluorescence decay
profiles. The fluorescence lifetime is summarized in Table 1 for all the titrations. The
average fluorescence lifetime (τav) for wsNP-Cdots
is found to be 1.70 ns. After the addition of 5 μL TNP to the
wsNP-Cdots, it becomes 1.65 ns. Further addition of TNP to the wsNP-Cdots
solution does not make any remarkable changes in the average fluorescence
lifetime (Table 1).
From these observations, it is found that there is a minor change
in the fluorescence lifetime which specifies that the quenching mechanism
is through a static process.59−61 The static quenching process
suggests the ground state complex formation between wsNP-Cdots and
TNP.60

3.6 Real Time Detection
For a practical
use of any application, a method has to be easy and one should be
able to carry out it anywhere. Taking this into consideration, we
have prepared wsNP-Cdots (0.05 mg/mL)-coated TLC plates. The as-prepared
TLC plates show good fluorescence under UV lights. The individual
TLC plates were half-dipped in the aqueous solution of analytes (1
× 10–2 M), and the fluorescence quenching for
each analyte was observed. The TLC plate dipped in TNP shows high
quenching while other TLC plates show no quenching (Figure 11). This observation clearly
indicates the use of wsNP-Cdots for selective and real-time detection
of TNP.

Ni+2, Co+2, Cu+2, Pb+2, Cd+2, Na+, Ba+2, Fe+2, TNP, RDX, 2,6 DNT, 2,4 DNT, DMDNB, nitromethane, and TNT, respectively.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
N and P co-doped NP-Cdots were quickly and easily
synthesized. As-prepared inNP-Cdots are water insoluble and after
treatment with conc. HNO3, they become water soluble (wsNP-Cdots).
The wsNP-Cdots are having very low particle size and show the characteristic
interlayer spacing of carbon materials. The wsNP-Cdots show good fluorescence
properties, and they are highly selective and sensitive (23 μM)
toward nitro explosive TNP. Easy real-time use of wsNP-Cdots-coated
TLC plates for the detection of TNP is also possible.
