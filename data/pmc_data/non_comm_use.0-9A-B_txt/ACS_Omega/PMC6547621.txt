Cell plasma membranes are a heterogeneous
mixture of lipids and
membrane proteins. The importance of heterogeneous lipid domains (also
called lipid rafts) as a molecular sorting platform has been implicated
in many physiological processes. Cell plasma membranes that are detached
from the cytoskeletal structure spontaneously phase separate into
distinct domains at equilibrium, which show their inherent demixing
properties. Recently, researchers have discovered that proteins with
strong interprotein interactions also spontaneously phase separate
into distinct protein domains, thus enabling the maintenance of many
membraneless organelles. Protein phase separation may also take place
on the lipid membranes via lipid-anchored proteins, which suggests
another potential molecular sorting platform for physiological processes
on the cell membrane. When two-phase separation properties coexist
physiologically, they may change the resulting phase behavior or serve
as independent sorting platforms. In this paper, we used in vitro
reconstitution and fluorescence imaging to systematically quantify
the phase behavior that arises when proteins with inherent phase separation
properties interact with raft mixture lipid membranes. Our observations
and simulations show both that the proteins may enhance lipid phase
separation and that this is a general property of phase-separating
protein systems with a diverse number of components involved. This
suggests that we should consider the overall effect of the properties
of both membrane-anchored proteins and lipids when interpreting molecular
sorting phenomena on the membranes.

Introduction
Cell plasma membrane
is a mixture of many lipids and membrane proteins.
Cell membranes are not a completely homogeneous mixture, and heterogeneous
composition domains or cell membrane phase domains are known as lipid
rafts.1,2 Many biological processes that take place
on the membranes involve the sorting of membrane proteins. Examples
include membrane trafficking3 and signaling
processes such as T-cell, B-cell, and Eph-signaling.4−7 Membrane phase domains can work as a sorting platform for proteins
on the membranes because different membrane molecules have different
partition preferences for domains.8 Cell
plasma membrane detachment vesicles have shown very clear binary phase
separation, which is temperature-dependent and reversible.9 The observation suggests that the phase separation
is a thermodynamically spontaneous process below the transition temperature.
A plasma membrane mimicking a lipid-only ternary mixture system also
showed a reversible binary mixing transition, suggesting that the
process is largely lipid-driven.10 However,
this discrete thermodynamic phase transition has never been observed
in living cells.11 Similarly, no micrometer
scale phase domains have been observed in living cell membranes except
for a special case of the yeast vacuole membranes.12 This is because the cell membrane is closely linked to
the actin cytoskeletal structure, which may suppress the phase domain
formation by continuously applying tension.13,14 Linkage to the skeletal structure also gives different parts of
the membrane different physical properties, promoting a localized
physical response.15 Considering all of
these findings, the current view of lipid rafts is characterized by
the heterogeneous and dynamic fluctuation of the lipid membrane composition,
driven by inherent thermodynamic phase separation properties that
are influenced by active lipid–protein interactions.16

Thermodynamic phase separation is a commonly
used molecular sorting
principle for living cells, and it is not only limited to the lipid
membrane domains.17−19 Cytosolic proteins can also form phase domains. Phase
separation or demixing happens when the energetic advantage of intermolecular
interaction is greater than the entropic cost of forming relatively
ordered domains. At high concentrations, multivalent binding proteins
spontaneously form phase-separated domains or liquid droplets.20 Other phase-separating proteins utilize the
interaction of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which often
involves interaction with RNA molecules.19,21−23 A phase domain can work as a sorting platform because
different cargo molecules have different partition preferences for
domains.24,25 A domain may also capture small synaptic
vesicles.26 Many membraneless organelles
such as p-granules, stress granules, processing bodies, Cajal bodies,
and nucleoli are maintained via the spontaneous phase separation of
proteins,27,28 and maintaining proper phase domains is
important for regular physiological functions.

Recent studies
have shown that some membrane-anchored protein systems
can exhibit two-dimensional (2D) phase separation on lipid membranes
that are independent of lipid-membrane-driven phase separation,29−31 which suggests that anchored protein-driven phase separation may
be an important principle of membrane sorting. Since we realize that
both anchored protein- and lipid-driven phase separations are relevant
for molecular sorting on the membrane, it is important to understand
how they interact with each other. The way that protein and lipid
domains interact with each other on the membranes has never been studied
before. Two different types of phase separations, between lipids and
proteins, may compete with or assist each other to form collaborative
domains. Alternatively, they may be entirely orthogonal to each other,
providing a potential platform for higher-order sorting processes
than with binary segregation.

In this study, we used an in vitro
reconstitution approach to build
systems with inherent lipid-driven and anchored protein-driven separation
properties in well-controlled experimental conditions (Figure 1). Ternary mixtures of lipid
giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) with inherent phase separation behavior
were generated, and various protein systems with inherent phase separation
behavior were purified to interact on the GUV. Fluorescent tags were
introduced for confocal fluorescence imaging. Our observations suggest
that anchored proteins with inherent phase separation properties can
enhance the overall phase separation in the membrane system.

The upper left panel shows a typical confocal fluorescence image of
a phase-separated ternary mixture GUV. The signal was from TR-DHPE
lipid. The upper right panel shows a typical confocal fluorescence
image of a solution phase-separated protein droplet domain from a
two-component system (SH3 × 4 and PRM × 4). The signal was
from SH3 × 4-Atto488. Scale bars are 5 μm. The lower schematic
is a possible outcome of coexistence of both on the lipid bilayer.

Results and Discussion
Two-Component Phase-Separating
Proteins Increase the Phase Separation
of the Lipid Raft Mixture
We first tried to reconstitute
anchored protein-driven phase separation on the lipid membrane environment
using a well-known set of proteins with inherent phase separation
behavior. SH3 and PRM protein domains, or a two-component system,
are an important binding pair in T-cell receptor clustering. T-cell
receptor clustering is a part of the T-cell signaling process, which
is triggered by antigen recognition.29,31 Multivalent
binding between two domains can generate gel-like droplets or phase-separated
domains in solution at high concentrations (Figure 1). We anchored four times repeated SH3 domains
(SH3 × 4) on the lipid membrane using Ni2+ coordination
of the polyhistidine tag to the lipid Ni-NTA and then added 4×
repeated PRM domains (PRM × 4) in a solution without the polyhistidine
tag. As three-dimensional (3D) protein domains or liquid droplet formation
usually happens at a concentration of >100 μM,20 and the lipid environment tends to reduce the
necessary
concentration,30 we carried out our experiments
at protein concentrations of <5 μM.

When we incubated
the 2 μM proteins with the control glass-supported lipid bilayer
(98% DOPC, 2% Ni-DGS, 0.01% TR-DHPE), we found that the strong interprotein
interaction made proteins on the bilayer only partially mobile (Supporting
Information, Figure S1). This means that
purely protein-driven phase separation of the two-component system
that is in fluidic equilibrium on the membrane cannot be achieved
at this condition. Next, we studied the effect of interprotein interaction
on a ternary mixture lipid GUV with inherent lipid-driven phase separation
(Figure 2a). We selected
a GUV composition where the vesicles were close to phase separation,
but with the majority of vesicles still uniform, or not yet phase-separated
(45% DOPC, 20% DPPC, 35% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE).
This made it easy to quantify how proteins with inherent phase properties
affected the membranes.10 A previous study
reported GUVs with a similar composition with a higher ratio of phase-separated
vesicles than our system.32 This difference
could be due to the fact that we had charged lipid species, 5% DOPS,
and performed the experiment under the ionic concentration of 100
mM NaCl, which affects the overall phase behavior. As a result, we
only interpreted the data within our observations where the condition
was controlled in the same way. As negatively charged lipid species
are an important major component of the cell plasma membrane,33 we believed that we could better mimic the plasma
membrane property by considering the charge interaction. Therefore,
we included 5% DOPS in all of our subsequent vesicles in this paper.

Figure 2 Two-component
phase-separating proteins on the phase-separated
lipid membrane. (a) SH3 × 4 and PRM × 4 were added from
solution to interact with ternary mixture GUVs with phase separation
properties (green and gray for separated domains). SH3 × 4 (yellow)
had a small soluble maltose binding protein (MBP, gray) domain with
a polyhistidine tag, so it spontaneously anchored itself to the membranes
by strong binding to Ni-NTA lipid. (b, c) Matching typical images
of the Atto488 protein channel and the TexasRed-DHPE lipid channel
of a two-phase-separated GUV. (d, e) Matching typical images of a
two-phase-separated GUV. (f, g) Matching typical images of a GUV with
multiple-phase domains. Scale bars are 5 μm. Lipid compositions
were 45% DOPC, 20% DPPC, 35% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1%
TR-DHPE.

We incubated the ternary mixture
of GUVs with different concentration
combinations of SH3 × 4 and PRM × 4. GUVs were observed
after 30 min of incubation. After incubation, the GUVs were statistically
analyzed by taking multiple z-stacks of confocal
images by both the protein and the lipid fluorescence channels. Typical
examples of confocal section images are shown in Figure 2b–g. Uniform GUVs showed
the same overlapping fluorescence in both channels. Phase-separated
GUVs showed segregated fluorescence, where protein and lipid fluorescence
usually overlapped well. Both TR-DHPE and Ni-NTA protein anchoring
lipids preferred the ld domain of binary
lipid phase separation.34 We mainly used
protein fluorescence images to categorize the states of different
GUV phases, whereas lipid channel images were used to confirm the
observation and also to ensure that the GUVs were suitable for the
analysis. Vesicles with multiple-phase domains, or a number of distinct
domains, were categorized as microdomain–small multiple domains–vesicles
because such a state is known to be stable when the line tension between
two domains is relatively low.35,36

Figure 3 shows that
the ratio of uniform GUVs above the threshold concentration of 500
nM showed a significant decrease compared to the GUVs below the threshold
concentration due to the strong interprotein interaction of SH3 ×
4 and PRM × 4 on the membrane. Shaded subfigures are for conditions
where concentrations for both SH3 × 4 and PRM × 4 were the
same or above 500 nM, where we saw a higher ratio of phase-separated
vesicles. Nonshaded subfigures are for conditions where at least one
protein concentration was below the threshold concentration, 500 nM.
In the condition below the threshold concentration, most vesicles
were uniform without phase separation. This means that the two-component
proteins with inherent phase separation properties modulated the phase
behavior of the underlying lipid bilayer by increasing the overall
phase separation at high enough concentrations. Note that only SH3
× 4 was anchored to the membrane while PRM × 4 interacted
by binding to SH3, and it rules out the possibility that it was the
high concentration of polyhistidine-tagged proteins anchored to the
membrane that caused the change in phase behavior. This was also the
mode of interaction in previously reported protein-driven phase domains
on the membrane, where only one component of the phase-separating
proteins was anchored to the membranes, while other components were
interacting from the solution.29−31

Figure 3 Statistical distribution of resulting
phase behaviors of GUVs with
different concentrations of SH3 × 4 and PRM. Final phase states
of GUVs after incubation with the two-component protein system at
different combinations of proteins, 3 by 3, were quantified by analyzing z-stack images of well-defined GUVs. As indicated by the
shaded background, it was only when concentrations of both proteins
were 500 nM or higher that the phase distribution was shifted significantly
toward the direction of more phase-separated vesicles. Error bars
are standard deviations of multiple z-stacks analyzed.
Each image covered the area of 212 × 212 μm2 with >20 vesicles. The data are averages of six z-stacks.

This observation suggests that
membrane–protein interaction
on the living cell plasma membranes, assisted by the raft composition
of the lipid membrane, may be able to form domains as a result of
the interaction between lipid and protein phase separations. The fact
that both interactions coexist on the plasma membranes indicates that
membrane-assisted phase separation may occur even when the condition
is not strictly favorable for lipid-only- or protein-only-driven phase
separation because the overall system may still be in a state of spontaneous
phase separation.

One-Component Phase-Separating Proteins Increase
Phase Separation
in a Manner Dependent on Lipid Composition
After observing
the increased phase domains by the two-component system, we wanted
to find out whether this was a general rule for other similar proteins
with phase separation property on the membranes. We performed similar
experiments with an artificially membrane-anchored IDR of DDX4 protein,
which we call a one-component system in this paper (Figure 4a). The IDR of DDX4 is known
to favorably interact with itself. At a high enough concentration,
it forms protein-driven phase domains in solution, which are responsible
for the formation of membraneless organelles in living cells37 (Supporting Information, Figure S2). To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet
reported a physiological example of a one-component system on the
membrane. This artificially anchored one-component system should,
therefore, be considered as a model system with a minimal number of
proteins used to reconstruct general phase behavior on the membranes.

Figure 4 One-component
phase-separating proteins on the phase-separated
lipid membrane. (a) DDX-GFP proteins were added from solution to interact
with ternary mixture GUVs with phase separation properties (green
and gray for separated domains). Intrinsically disordered DDX domain
(orange) was continued from the fluorescent GFP (gray) domain with
a polyhistidine tag, so it spontaneously anchored itself to the membranes
by strong binding to Ni-NTA lipid. (b, c) Matching typical images
of the GFP protein channel and the TexasRed-DHPE lipid channel of
a two-phase-separated GUV. (d, e) Matching typical images of a two-phase-separated
GUV. (f, g) Matching typical images of a GUV with multiple-phase domains.
Scale bars are 5 μm. Lipid compositions were 42% DOPC, 29% DPPC,
14% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE for (b)–(e)
and 10% DOPC, 50% DPPC, 25% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1%
TR-DHPE for (f) and (g).

Similar to two-component systems, one-component DDX4 at high
concentration
(>100 μM) could form liquid droplets in solution. Proteins
at
1 μM formed a homogeneous immobile protein layer instead of
fluidic protein-driven phase domains on the control glass-supported
lipid bilayer as a result of strong interprotein interaction (Supporting
Information, Figure S2). Ternary mixture
GUVs with inherent, lipid-driven phase separation behavior were generated
and observed before and after incubation with the 1 μM DDX4
proteins. The DDX4 protein had a polyhistidine tag to anchor itself
to the membrane. The lipid composition was similar to the lipid mix
of the two-component experiments but was a bit lower in DOPC and cholesterol,10 which enhanced the TR-DHPE fluorescence contrast
between the two domains (42% DOPC, 29% DPPC, 14% cholesterol, 5% DOPS,
10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE). Protein and lipid fluorescence overlapped
very well after protein incubation and showed similar behavior to
uniform, two-phase separation and microdomains (Figure 4b–g). Statistical distributions of
the GUV state before and after protein incubation were quantified.

As shown in Figure 5a, the one-component interaction of the DDX protein decreased the
ratio of uniform GUVs, thus increasing the ratio of phase-separated
GUVs. This suggests that proteins on the membrane with strong interprotein
interaction can, in general, shift lipid phase behavior toward increased
phase separation. Ratios for both two-phase states and microdomains
increased, which may be a natural result of the decrease in uniform
vesicles. Although we did not see any clear evidence to suggest a
dramatic change in the ratio between a two-phase state and a microdomain,
we categorized all clear phase separation with multiple domains as
microdomains to distinguish them from a simple two-phase state.

Figure 5 Statistical
distribution of GUV phase behaviors before and after
interacting with one-component protein DDX. (a) Ratio of phase-separated
GUV increased after one-component DDX protein incubation. The lipid
compositions were 45% DOPC, 20% DPPC, 35% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10%
Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE. (b) For a different lipid composition, the ratio
of GUV phase states did not change significantly after the protein
incubation. The lipid compositions were 10% DOPC, 50% DPPC, 25% cholesterol,
5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE for (f) and (g).

We also tested another lipid composition with less
DOPC (10% DOPC,
50% DPPC, 25% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE). This
composition was also along the tie line of the ternary mixture phase
diagram from a previous study.38 When a
composition is along the tie line, the composition of each separated
domain is supposed to be the same but their relative areas are different.
A relatively less ordered, or ld, domain
is supposed to be smaller in this composition. We note that it may
not lie strictly on the exact tie line because our composition was
not identical to the one reported previously, which did not include
charged lipid and functionalizing lipid. However, we expected them
to be close to the tie line as the charged lipid DOPS and Ni-NTA that
we introduced had the same unsaturated carbon tail structure as the
lipid DOPC. When we repeated the protein interaction experiment with
this GUV composition, we could not see clear differences before and
after adding the one-component DDX4 proteins (Figure 5b). This suggests that a protein-driven increase
of phase separation may not be universally applicable to all lipid
compositions and may be dependent on the composition, to some extent.
This could be due to the fact that the same interprotein interaction
may or may not cause significant disruption to make a transition in
lipid phase behavior in a different lipid mixture. It is also worth
mentioning that the GUVs in the composition tested later were mostly
phase-separated already before interacting with proteins, leaving
only limited room for an increase in phase separation.

Two-Dimensional
(2D) Ising Model Simulations Show That Coupled
2D Layers with Phase Separation Property Will Increase the Overall
Phase Separation of the System
We used a 2D Ising model system
to help explain our observation of increased phase separation by the
proteins with inherent phase separation property. As lipid membranes
and proteins are both quite large molecular systems to simulate ab
initio, many different models have been introduced with an emphasis
on specific physical properties of interest. These include all-atomic
models,11,39 coarse-grained models,40 mechanical models,41 sphere
Monte-Carlo models,36 and Ising models.11,42 The Ising model treats two phases as up- and down-spins. Neighboring
spins with the same sign stabilize the energy of the system. Although
the model omits molecular details of phase behavior, it is a great
system to describe phase organization of the membranes when we are
interested in properties of binary phase domains in general. In this
study, we are interested in how two-phase domains, lipid domains and
anchored protein domains, affect each other, and the interaction can
be interpreted as a general interaction between two domains, and so
molecular detail is of secondary interest. We assumed that the two
layers of 2D Ising models were stacked up. The two layers were originally
independent systems, but there were a discrete number, L, of linker spins that connected the two layers. When a linker spin
moved in one layer, its matching linker spin had to move in the other
layer as well. The linker spins represent proteins linked to the membranes
via membrane anchors. The upper layer represents protein-driven phase
behavior, whereas the lower layer represents lipid-driven phase behavior.
To conserve the number of up- and down-spins, we used Kawasaki dynamics
where spins can only move by thermal fluctuation with no spin flipping.11,42 The protein layer was set to have Jupper = 0.9 of the interparticle interaction instead of Jlower = 1.0 for the lipid layer, so it was above the phase
transition temperature of the simulation. J indicates
the amount of interparticle interaction energy in the Ising model
and is often used without the unit for convenience. Temperature T is also used without unit by defining it relative to a
reference value. See Method and Supporting Information for a detailed simulation
procedure.

At the simulated temperature, T =
2.3, which was the expected original critical temperature of the lower
layer and was also above the original transition temperature of the
upper layer, we saw, as expected, independent fluctuation of both
layers when the two layers were completely independent (Figure 6a). At its critical point,
the lower layer showed typical critical behavior of correlated fluctuation.43 The upper layer was above its critical temperature
due to lower interparticle stabilization and showed more homogeneous
fluctuation. When 10% of the spins were linked using linker spins
in the same condition, the two systems showed a strongly correlated
fluctuation, as evidenced by the larger area of phase overlap between
the two layers (Figure 6b). The entire system of two layers also became more phase-separated
with less homogeneous mixing of the two spins. This indicates that
coupling the two layers with independent phase behaviors via linker
species lowered the transition temperature of the whole system, promoting
greater phase segregation in both layers. Therefore, our observations
of one-component and two-component protein systems interacting with
phase-separated membranes can be understood as an example of a case
of coupled layers with phase-separating properties. More simulation
data with different parameters can be found in the Supporting Information
(Figure S3).

Figure 6 Layered two-dimensional
(2D) Ising model simulations show increased
phase separation when two layers are linked by linkers. Spin states
of a simulation after t = 2 000 000
steps. For the lower layer, black and red colors indicate two spins.
For the upper layer, black and green colors indicate two spins. T = 2.3, which was the critical temperature for the lower
layer, and the upper layer was above its critical temperature due
to lower interparticle stabilization energy (0.9 of the lower layer). N, or the total number of spins, were 40 000 for
each layer. (a) Spin states for when L, the number
of linker spins, was zero. Two layers showed independent fluctuations
without much segregation behavior. (b) Spin states when L, the number of linker spins, was 4000, which was 10% of the total
number of spins. Both layers are clearly segregated into distinct
phases and two layers are moving in a correlated manner. It shows
that the link between two layers can promote more phase segregation
of the overall system.

Three-Component Phase-Separating Proteins with Preformed Phase
Domains Can Generate More Complex Molecular Segregation
We
further increased the number of proteins involved to three to study
their interaction with the phase-separated lipid membranes. The three-component
system is so far the only system with reported 2D phase separation
behavior on the membrane.29−31 We used the protein system involved
in T-cell signaling, but the LAT protein was replaced with a simple
peptide, which had a sequence of a part of LAT with two phosphorylation
sites (Figure 7a).
On a supported lipid bilayer, the system was not able to form dynamic
protein domains on the membrane, as reported previously, possibly
due to the fact that our peptide mimics only a portion of the original
LAT protein. However, it formed a relatively static network of domains
that were in equilibrium with a pool of proteins. The system also
formed protein-driven phase domains, or liquid droplets, readily in
solution (Supporting Information, Figure S4).

Figure 7 Three-component phase-separating proteins on the phase-separated
lipid membrane. (a) PRM × 4, GRB2-GST, and LAT sequence peptide
were added from solution to interact with ternary mixture GUVs with
phase separation properties (green and gray for separated domains).
LAT sequence peptide (green) was labeled with Atto488 at the C-terminal
and had a polyhistidine tag at N-terminal, so it spontaneously anchored
itself to the membranes by strongly binding to Ni-NTA lipid. (b–g)
Matching typical images of the Atto488 protein channel and the TexasRed-DHPE
lipid channel of GUVs with multiple-phase domains. Scale bars are
5 μm. Lipid compositions were 42% DOPC, 29% DPPC, 14% cholesterol,
5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE.

We performed a similar experiment by mixing 5 μM of
each
protein into the phase-separating GUVs with the same composition,
as used for the first experiment with the one-component system (42%
DOPC, 29% DPPC, 14% cholesterol, 5% DOPS, 10% Ni-DGS, 0.1% TR-DHPE).
The three-component system had a strong tendency to form protein-driven
phase droplets. As a result, in the experimental conditions, we were
able to see the protein mixture solution already becoming murky, which
is a sign of protein droplet formation, immediately after mixing the
three components into ∼25 μM. This solution was diluted
five times into the GUV solution to allow for interaction. This meant
that we observed the effect of preformed protein domains interacting
with the lipid membranes with phase separation in addition to the
effect of proteins with inherent phase separation properties. Even
similar fluidic protein domain droplets might have different properties
in terms of kinetic and thermodynamic properties,44 and we note that the protein droplets were stable for up
to 2 h during our observation.

After the incubation, we observed
typical GUVs with multiple-phase
domains, as shown in Figure 7b–g. Most vesicles had multiple domains with uneven
fluorescence intensity, giving a ratio of phase-separated vesicles
above 90%, an increase from the original 70% (Figure 5a, before the protein incubation). We were
not able to distinguish a pure 2D interaction on the membrane or interaction
with 3D protein domains. Due to this ambiguity, we did not perform
the same categorization of vesicle states that we did for other protein
systems. The three-component system, interestingly enough, showed
what looked like a higher-order organization by 3D protein domains.
We could see the existence of binary phases around the contour of
the lipid membranes and, in addition, we were often able to see the
existence of a much brighter region related to interaction with the
3D protein domains. This suggests that when conditions are right,
3D protein domains interacting with the lipid membrane may be able
to provide an additional molecular sorting platform. The cell cytosol
is extremely crowded, and membrane–protein interaction is never
limited to the 2D interaction in living cells. Accordingly, this is
a possible mechanism for physiological sorting processes.

Conclusions
We reconstituted interactions between lipid membranes and proteins
with phase separation behavior. One- and two-component protein systems
promoted phase domain formation on GUVs with ternary mixture lipid
compositions with relatively high ratios of unsaturated phospholipid
DOPC. A coupled, 2D Ising model simulation showed that this can be
understood as a natural result of two layers with phase separation
property coupled by linker molecules. A three-component protein system
with preformed protein domains interacted with the ternary mixture
lipid GUVs to generate GUVs with multiple domains on the membranes.
3D phase domains interacting with a 2D lipid membrane offered a potential
mechanism for a more complex sorting process on the cell membranes.

Our study suggests that coexisting phase separation properties
of proteins and lipids will interact with each other, changing the
final phase separation outcome of the entire system, and we should
consider the combined effect of both. As living cell membranes, specifically
mammalian plasma membranes, are well known to have inherent phase
separation properties,9,45 we should expect enhanced protein-driven
phase separation on the lipid membrane bilayer. Acknowledging the
enhanced phase separation on the membrane should help us to interpret
and engineer molecular sorting processes in the future.

Caution
should be exercised when translating our in vitro experimental
data to living cell membranes, and we wanted to highlight a few important
points. First, living cell membranes are far more complex than our
artificial membrane system. Living cell membranes contain a lot more
lipids and transmembrane proteins,46 and
membrane proteins are often dynamically interacting with cytosolic
proteins such as actin cytoskeleton.47 Therefore,
it is important to realize that the thermodynamic property of simple
artificial membrane systems may not appear exactly as expected in
living cell membranes.15 Second, living
cell membranes are asymmetric. Lipid bilayers are composed of two
leaflets, and many living cell membranes, including the plasma membrane,
actively maintain the compositions of leaflets in an asymmetric manner.48 Asymmetric distribution of glycolipids may further
force the movement of cholesterol from one leaflet to the other.49 GUV bilayers are symmetric, and the effect of
asymmetric lipid distribution is not included in our study, while
asymmetric membranes may result in a more complicated phase behavior.50 Lastly, some major components in cell plasma
membranes, such as sphingomyelin and ganglioside that are missing
in our reconstitution, are known to play important roles in membrane
organization. Glycolipids, for example, may itself interact with other
molecules such as extracellular matrix and GPI membrane anchors by
the carbohydrate groups, changing the overall phase behavior and organization.51,52

Methods
GUV Preparation
A total net mass of between 0.2 and
0.5 mg of lipid mixture of the desired composition in chloroform was
mixed in a clean round-bottom flask. Chloroform was then removed by
rotavap under vacuum at 50 °C for >30 min to generate a uniform
lipid film. The film was further dried by clean nitrogen blown for
5 min. Then, 1 mL of sucrose solution (at a concentration of 220 mM
to match osmotic balance with the buffer) was added to incubate overnight
at 37 °C. After incubation, the GUV sample was centrifuged at
11 500 RPM for 15 min at room temperature to remove aggregated
lipid species. Supernatant was taken and stored at 4 °C before
use. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.

Protein Purification
Most proteins discussed in this
paper were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 (Sigma-Aldrich) to affinity purify by polyhistidine or
GST tag, and appropriate further purification steps were taken as
needed. Briefly, SH3 × 4 and PRM × 4 were purified by steps
that were similar to the previous protocol.20 The plasmids were generous gifts from the Rosen lab (UT Southwestern).
After overexpression in E. coli, proteins
were affinity purified by Ni-NTA column and further purified by ion
exchange column (SP Sepharose FF 5 mL and HiTrap Q HP 5 mL, GE Healthcare)
and size exclusion column (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare). The PRM ×
4 were cleaved enzymatically to remove unwanted MBP-polyhistidine
tags. Further purification was performed to separate out tags. The
DDX4-GFP gene was synthesized and introduced into a plasmid based
on the original sequence (GenScript). E. coli was grown at 37 °C for 3–5 h to overexpress by IPTG
(Sigma-Aldrich) 1 mM RT overnight. Harvested cells were sonicated
and centrifuged to affinity purify by Ni-NTA (Thermo Fischer Scientific).
Imidazole solution (300 mM) in 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 300 mM
NaCl was used for elution. Imidazole solution (3 mM) in the same buffer
was used for washing. The protein was finally purified by desalting
column (HiTrap 5 mL, Invitrogen). Proteins were centrifuged before
use to remove potential aggregates. The GRB2 gene was obtained from
AddGene, which was deposited by Vale lab.29 GRB2 plasmid-introduced E. coli was
grown at 37 °C for 3–5 h to overexpress by IPTG 0.5 mM
RT overnight. Harvested cells were sonicated and centrifuged to affinity
purify by GST resins (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Glutathione solution
(10 mM) in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 150
mM NaCl was used for elution, and the same buffer solution without
glutathione was used for washing. The protein was desalting column
purified to remove excess glutathione. For the reported experiments,
we used the purified GRB2 protein as it is, but we also tried experiments
with the GST-tag-removed GRB2 by enzymatic digestion. Here, there
was no difference in the observed behavior of protein phase formation.
The peptide was synthetized by Biomatik. Its sequence is given in
the Supporting Information. Two phosphate
groups were introduced as part of the synthesis process, and the peptide
was used within 2 h of thawing to prevent potential loss of the phosphate
group.

Protein Labeling
SH3 × 4 and LAT-like peptide
were fluorescently labeled by Atto488-maleimide (Invitrogen) using
a cysteine residue introduced for the purpose of site-specific labeling.
Protein solution was incubated with an equal concentration of Atto488-maleimide
overnight at 4 °C in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl buffer,
which was also the standard buffer for most of the experiments in
this paper. Labeled proteins were purified by desalting to remove
unbound dyes. The typical labeling ratio varied from 20 to 60%, which
was measured by Nanodrop (Thermo Fischer Scientific).

GUV-Protein
Sample Imaging
A home-built stainless steel
holder that could enclose a round cover glass at the bottom was used
for imaging. An open chamber was made of >1 mL volume above the
cover
glass to add any solution for imaging. The holder was cleaned by bath
sonication for 30 min in 1% detergent solution and then sonicated
for 30 min in isopropyl alcohol and water at a 1:1 ratio. After assembling
the cover glass and the holder, the glass surface was blocked by incubating
with 1 mg/mL BSA solution for 30 min. After incubation, the chamber
was washed five times with buffer to add 10–50 μL of
GUV solution for imaging.

To analyze protein interaction, the
desired concentrations of proteins were added by pipette injection
and were mixed gently. To ensure quick and homogeneous interaction,
the protein solution was added at a comparable volume to the volume
of solution in the chamber (20–50% by volume).

A Nikon
Eclipse C1 confocal fluorescence microscope system was
used for imaging. Lasers (488 and 543 nm) were used for excitation
of Atto488/GFP and TexasRed, respectively. The Nikon Plan Apo VC 60X
WI Water objective was used for imaging. Automatic z position control was used for precise z-stack acquisition
and x, y were controlled manually.
FIJI (ImageJ) was used for image analysis.

Ising Model Simulation
A Kawasaki dynamics, 2D Ising
model Monte-Carlo simulation was performed following a general method.42 Matlab (MathWorks) software was used for the
simulation. Spins (200 × 200) were simulated, with half the spins
being up-spins and half down-spins in one layer. Two layers of simulations
were run simultaneously. All spins were initialized by randomly mixing
spins at a very high temperature. Each time step performed 80 000
trials of moving particles by one position. Energy change was calculated
for each potential movement. When neighboring spins had the same sign,
it contributed −J = −1.0 of stabilization.
Upper and lower layer spins were not assumed to interact directly.
If the new state was lower in energy, the move was accepted. If not,
the new state was accepted by probability exp(−ΔE/T). If the selected spin was one of the
linker spins, which span both layers, the energy contribution from
both layers was calculated, and the linker spin moved in both layers
when the movement was accepted. All linker spins were assumed to be
up-spins. A total of 2 000 000 steps was performed for
each simulation. The critical temperature or transition temperature
of the 2D Ising model with J = 1.0 is Tc = 2.3. In our layered simulation, Jlower = 1.0 and Jupper = 0.9,
which means the lower layer was at its original critical temperature
at T = 2.3, and the upper layer was still above at
its original critical temperature at T = 2.3. It
took 1.3 days to complete one simulation by a 2.8 GHz CPU. A detailed
stepwise simulation method and the definition of a unit step can be
found in the Supporting Information.
