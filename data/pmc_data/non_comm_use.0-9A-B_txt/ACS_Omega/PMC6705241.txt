Monodispersed and transparent hybrid silica wires were synthesized by the sol–gel
method using the chemical surfactant trimethoxyoctylsilane (C8TMOS or C11H26O3Si) and,
for the first time, by green surfactants (Nelumbo nucifera/lotus leaf extract). The purpose was to introduce a less toxic,
cost-effective, and one-step easy approach to get superhydrophobic
silica films. Each of the surfactants was used at two different concentrations
to investigate hydrophobicity of the films. Assembly of silica wires
was obtained by dip-coating and vacuum filtration methods on glass
and cellulose acetate filter paper as substrates, respectively. The
water contact angle (CA) up to 154° was measured for hybrid silica
films on filter paper, which revealed their superhydrophobicity as
compared to hydrophobic behavior of those films coated on a glass
substrate with CA up to 135°. Chemical, optical, and structural
properties of prepared films were characterized by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, scanning electron
microscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry.
The hybrid silica wires prepared displayed good transparency, low
surface energy, and superhydrophobicity. These silica assemblies can
create outstanding and multifunctional structures with superhydrophobic
coatings for waterproof electronic devices, military uniforms, self-cleaning
surfaces, etc.

Introduction
The
green chemistry approach has become very popular in recent
years because it is environmentally friendly and less toxic in contrast
to conventional chemical methods. In green synthesis, plant extracts
are used for the bioreduction of materials to form nanoparticles.
Green synthesis has numerous applications in nanotechnology such as
in medicine, water cleaning, green solar cells, and energy applications.
It has been demonstrated that plant metabolites such as terpenoids,
sugars, polyphenols, alkaloids, proteins, and phenolic acids play
a significant role in the reduction of material ions into nanoparticles.1,2

Primarily, most of hydrophobic coatings and films were used
as
edible protective films/coatings.3−5 It has been well established
that the use of nanofillers such as titanium dioxide,6 zinc oxide,7 silica,8 etc. can generate transparent superhydrophobic
coatings for large-scale industrial applications in various fields.
Multifunctional transparent silica films/coatings are becoming very
popular these days due to their variety of applications from anti-icing9 to antifogging,10 antifouling,11 anticontamination, self-cleaning,12 and anticorrosion.13

To the best of our knowledge, no work has been reported yet
on
transparent hybrid silica hydrophobic coatings prepared by green synthesis.
In the present research work, the hybrid silica films/coatings have
been synthesized using a green surfactant (Nelumbo
nucifera leaf extract), for the first time, as well
as by a chemical surfactant (trimethoxyoctylsilane (C8TMOS)).
The synthesis was inspired by the work of Deliang et al.14 with some modifications that produced excellent
water-repellent films on glass slides and cellulose acetate filter
paper using the dip-coating method and vacuum filtration, respectively.
The effect of the concentration of surfactants on the hydrophobicity
of the films was also studied.15 At the
industrial level, these hybrid hydrophobic silica films may be used
from microfluidic16 and optical devices17 to sensors,18 battery
technology,19 ballistic uniforms,20 surgical tools,21 self-cleaning,22 anticorrosion surfaces,
etc.23

Wettability by Measuring the Contact Angle
(CA)
The
water contact angles (CAs) of the silica films were measured by a
3D digital camera to study the wettability of the films. First, the
silica films grown on cellulose filter paper, prepared by 40 μL
of green surfactant (N. nucifera/lotus
leaf extract), resulted into the CA of 149° (Figure 1a), showing hydrophobicity,
which improved to CA of 150° by doubling the amount of green
surfactant, as shown in Figure 1b. The hydrophobic behavior of the films is due to the fact
that the N. nucifera leaf extract has
long-chain secondary alcohol nonacosan-10-ol and secondary alkanediols
as its main chemical constituents. The long-chain secondary alcohols
especially secondary alkanediols with a chain length of 29 carbon
atoms had already been reported in the composition of tubular wax
of N. nucifera.24 These long-chain alkyl groups appear on the surface of
the silica film, making it water-repellent.14 Increasing the amount of surfactant adds more alkyl groups to the
surface of the film, hence making it more hydrophobic.

Figure 1 Digital photographs of
the contact angle formed between the water
drop and transparent hybrid silica films on cellulose acetate filter
paper using (a) 40 μL of N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract (CA = 149°), (b) 80 μL of N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract (CA = 150°),
(c) 40 μL of C8TMOS (CA = 152°), and (d) 80
μL of C8TMOS (CA = 154°).

On the other hand, silica films grown on cellulose filter paper
prepared by 40 μL of chemical surfactant (trimethoxyoctylsilane
(C8TMOS) or C11H26O3Si)
have shown a CA of 152°, which indicates that prepared films
are superhydrophobic, as shown in Figure 1c. This superhydrophobicity is attributed
to the long-chain C8 alkyl group, which covers the building
blocks of Si films. Increasing the surfactant up to 80 μL resulted
in a larger CA of 154°, as shown in Figure 1d showing improved superhydrophobicity of
the films, which is ascribed to more octadecyl C8 groups
grown on silica films.14

Second,
the silica films coated on glass slides prepared by 40
and 80 μL of green surfactant resulted in CAs of 111 and 118°,
respectively, whereas in the case of chemical surfactant (C8TMOS), CAs were found to be 125 and 135°, respectively, for
the same concentrations as shown in Figure 2a–d. The CAs showed that these bottom-up-constructed
hybrid silica films are hydrophobic in nature. Overall, the contact
angles (CAs) for the filter paper films were larger than those on
the glass substrate because the roughness of the filter paper surface
results into less surface free energy and larger contact angles.25 This increase in water repellency on doubling
the amount of surfactant was much higher in the case of films deposited
on the glass substrate (111–135°) as compared to films
coated on filter paper (149–154°). This is because the
rough surface of filter paper already provided enough air pockets
(Figure 3) and hence
the decreased surface area of silica films resulted in superhydrophobicity.
An increase in the amount of surfactant (both green and chemical)
revealed close networking of the silica as well as more long carbon
tails attached to silica wires (Figure 3b,d). The close networking of silica somewhat fills
the air pockets (increasing the surface area), but increased number
of long carbon tails on the silica coatings give it a hierarchal structure,
increasing the water repellency of the films. Hence, the overall effect
on the improvement of superhydrophobicity was observed within contact
angles of 149° (showing a trend toward superhydrophobicity) to
154°. As materials having contact angle greater than 150°
due to the presence of air pockets under liquid drops are superhydrophobic
surfaces. However, in the case of the flat glass substrate, no air
pockets are present on silica films (Figure 3c,d). The only roughness to the films comes
from the silica network itself, providing water repellency in the
hydrophobic range (111°), which increases drastically up to 24°
(i.e. 135°) on doubling the amount of the surfactant. This considerable
jump in water repellency is because the larger amount of surfactant
results into much closer networking of silica, producing more air
pockets (Figure 3d)
on silica films and decreasing the surface area.26

hybrid silica films on the glass substrate using (a) 40 μL of

FTIR Analysis
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
was performed by an IRTracer-100 FTIR spectrometer in the 4000–400
cm–1 range. The spectrum formed by molecular adsorption
of IR radiation by silica wires forms molecular imprints of the sample,
which are ascribed to different vibrations (Table 1).

Most of the plant waxes are hydrophobic,
soluble in organic solvents, solid at room temperature, but soft and
malleable. These waxes are made up of a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons
and their derivatives with carbon chain lengths between 20 and 40
atoms. The main constituents are usually primary and secondary alcohols,
fatty acids, ketones, and aldehydes.27 Waxes
of N. nucifera (lotus) leaves consist
of secondary alcohol nonacosan-10-ol and nonacosanediols as their
main constituents.24,27 The high content of nonacosanediols
results into the growth of a dense layer of very small wax tubules
with a permanently hydrophobic surface.28

Figure 4a shows
the FTIR spectrum of the N. nucifera leaf extract. The characteristic absorption band at 3289 cm–1 is due to the hydroxyl polar (O–H) group,
which reveals the presence of secondary alcohols (nonacosan-10-ol).
The wax tubule of N. nucifera composed
of layers of nonacosan-10-ol and nonacosanediol molecules having OH
groups attached to them, which force them into a curvature, forming
a tubule. The polar OH groups are wrapped inside the layer, leaving
the nonpolar methyl (CH3) groups at the surface of tubules,
resulting in wax tubules having strong and relatively stable water
repellency.28 Highest contact angles are
presented by aliphatic waxes, which have methyl groups on the surface.29 A very weak absorption at around 2109 cm–1 arises from water as a result of a combination of
hindered rotation and O–H bending of water.30 A sharp band at 1635 cm–1 is due to aromatic
and C=C functional groups of phenolic compounds or cutan, whereas
the band at 1410 cm–1 is attributed to CH2 bending vibrations, which are due to the aliphatic materials present
in the plant cuticle: cutin, waxes, and cutan. A weak band at 1249
cm–1 is assigned to O–H bending vibrations
of hydroxyl groups from polysaccharides and cutin. Another band at
1059 cm–1 is attributed to symmetrical C–O–C
stretching vibrations, which are associated with the cutin matrix.31

Figure 4 (a) FTIR spectra of N. nucifera/lotus
leaf extract; FTIR spectra of hybrid silica wires prepared (b) without
any surfactant, (c) using 40 and 80 μL of green surfactant (GS: N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract), and (d) using 40
and 80 μL of chemical surfactant (CS: C8TMOS).

The FTIR spectrum of the silica wires prepared
without any green
surfactant (N. nucifera/lotus leaf
extract) and chemical surfactant (trimethoxyoctylsilane (C8TMOS)) is shown in Figure 4b. The peak at 3347 cm–1 is attributed to
the sharp and strong O–H stretching vibration of H2O in the sample,32−34 which is due to the fact that silica particles have
a tendency to absorb water from atmospheric air.34 The peaks at 2958 and 2855 cm–1 are attributed
to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the C–H
group, respectively.34 The peak at 1659
cm–1 is ascribed to imide C=O stretching32,33,35 and that at 1462 cm–1 is due to bending of −CH2–.35 The peak at 1387 cm–1 is assigned
to the C–H symmetric deformation vibrations (bending) of −CH2 groups and that at 1294 cm–1 is attributed
to the silicon-bonded alkyl group C–H bending. The band at
1040 cm–1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching vibrations
of O–Si–O.36 The peak at
928 cm–1 is assigned to the Si–OH bond,33,37 whereas the one appearing at 846 cm–1 corresponds
to the symmetric stretching vibrations of O–Si–O for
the prepared sample.32,36 A very feeble peak at 741 cm–1 is ascribed to CH2 rocking vibrations.36 These bands are very important and especially
those at 1040, 928, and 846 cm–1 confirm the presence
of silica even without surfactant.

The FTIR spectrum of wires
prepared using 40 and 80 μL of
green surfactant (N. nucifera/lotus
leaf extract) is shown in Figure 4c. The absorption peaks at 3338 and 3345 cm–1, respectively, are ascribed to stretching vibrations of the O–H
bond of water present in silica particles32,33 because silica particles absorb water from atmospheric air.34 Peaks at 2979 and 2854 cm–1 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations
of the C–H group, respectively, and are due to the existence
of many methyl (CH3) groups.36 These methyl groups are a part of the surface of N. nucifera wax tubules.28 A weak peak at around 2100 cm–1 is present in
the spectra of silica wires prepared by 80 μL of green surfactant,
which is absent in the sample prepared by 40 μL of the same
surfactant. This peak is due to a combination of hindered rotation
and O–H bending of water.30 The
absence of this peak in the second sample is because there are much
smaller number of silica wires to absorb water as compared to those
in the first sample.34 The bands at 1642
and 1646 cm–1 correspond to imide C=O stretching,32−34 whereas the peaks at 1478 cm–1 appear due to bending
of −CH2–35 in
both samples. Weak peaks appearing at 1374 and 1375 cm–1 are assigned to the C–H symmetric deformation vibrations
(bending) of −CH2 groups in the samples prepared
by 40 and 80 μL of green surfactant, respectively, and the peak
at 1268 cm–1 is attributed to the silicon-bonded
alkyl group C–H bending. The band at 1039 cm–1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching vibrations of O–Si–O.36 The peaks at 938 and 944 cm–1 are assigned to the Si–OH bond33,36 for the samples
prepared by 40 and 80 μL of green surfactant, respectively,
whereas the peak at 825 cm–1 corresponds to the
symmetric stretching vibrations of O–Si–O.32,36

The FTIR results of silica wires prepared by 40 and 80 μL
of chemical surfactant (trimethoxyoctylsilane (C8TMOS)
or C11H26O3Si) are shown in Figure 4d. The peaks at 3352
and 3359 cm–1 are ascribed to stretching vibrations
of the O–H bond of water32,33 absorbed by silica
wires from the atmosphere.34 A weak dip
at around 2100 cm–1 is due to the combination of
hindered rotation and O–H bending of water30 in the samples prepared by 40 and 80 μL of C8TMOS. This peak intensity is low enough in the first sample
as compared to the second sample, showing that there are smaller number
of silica wires in it to absorb water content, as less amount of C8TMOS supplies less Si and less silica mesh, which eventually
absorbs less water.34 The band at 1651
cm–1 corresponds to the imide C=O stretching.32−34 A weak peak appearing at around 1375 cm–1 is due
to the C–H symmetric deformation vibrations (bending) of −CH2 groups in the samples.36 The band
at 1037 cm–1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching
vibrations of O–Si–O.36 Peaks
at 941 and 940 cm–1 are attributed to the Si–OH
bond,32,36 whereas those at 818 and 827 cm–1 correspond to symmetric stretching vibrations of O–Si–O32,36 for the samples prepared by 40 and 80 μL of C8TMOS,
respectively.

The spectra in Figure 4d revealed that both samples, prepared by
40 and 80 μL
of C8TMOS, give peaks due to symmetric (2979 cm–1) and asymmetric stretching vibrations (2854 cm–1) of the methyl group (CH3),36 bending vibrations of −CH2– (1478 cm–1),35 and silicon-bonded
alkyl group C–H bending (1268 cm–1)36 around
the same wavelengths as in the case of samples prepared by the green
surfactant (N. nucifera leaf extract).

The bands associated with silica in the above discussion such as
Si–O–Si and Si–O provide evidence of the presence
of silica wires formed in the samples.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
of Samples
Thermal analysis
(TGA, DSC) of silica wires was carried out in an inert atmosphere
under a flow of argon gas using Q 600 (TA Instruments) at a heating
rate of 15 °C/min to trace the structural changes brought about
by the thermal treatment.

TGA and DSC curves of silica wires
prepared without any surfactant are shown in Figure 5a. The results showed a drastic weight loss
up to about 87.5% in the range 20–220 °C accompanied by
an endothermic peak at 157 °C, indicating the desorption of water,39 which was absorbed by silica wires34 and is evident by stretching vibrational and
bending peaks of the O–H bond observed in FTIR spectra (Figure 4). TGA and DSC curves
of the sample shown in Figure 5a revealed the sublimation effect in the sample, indicating
that prepared silica wires are with good stability within the present
temperature range.38

Figure 5 TGA and DSC curves of
hybrid silica wires prepared (a) without
surfactant, (b) using 80 μL of green surfactant (N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract), and (c) using 80
μL of chemical surfactant (C8TMOS).

The silica wires synthesized using 80 μL of green surfactant
(N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract) also
show a sudden weight loss up to 33% till the temperature exceeds 170
°C, which is also evident by an endothermic peak in the TGA curve
at 134 °C showing the evaporation of physisorbed water,39,40 as shown in Figure 5b. Then, it maintains a plateau till 290 °C, after which there
is again significant fall in the weight accompanied by an exothermic
effect, which is due to decomposition of C8 alkyl groups
capped on silica films.14,40 The sample showed sublimation
effect, showing no phase change.

The silica film prepared using
80 μL of chemical surfactant
(C8TMOS) showed a dramatic decrease in weight of up to
nearly 35% in the temperature range 40–165 °C, as shown
in Figure 5c. This
change corresponds to the endothermic peak in the TGA curve, which
occurs due to hydrolysis of the sample, i.e. removal of H2O.39 Then, the material maintains its
weight till 290 °C, after which it showed a further drop of up
to 25% weight at around 331 °C due to a small endothermic peak,
indicating a further water loss. On further increasing the temperature,
the material shows a very slight decrease in weight (about 2%) for
the rest of the temperature range.39 The
sample revealed sublimation effect, showing no phase change, indicating
that prepared silica wires are stable in the mentioned temperature
range.38

Optical Properties by UV–Vis
Spectroscopy
The
absorption spectrum of samples containing silica wires dispersed in
ethanol was recorded by UV–vis spectroscopy using a U-2800
HITACHI spectrometer in the range 200–800 nm. The UV–visible
spectrum of silica wires prepared without any surfactant shows no
absorption peak in the visible region (Figure 6), which is due to its wide band gap as glasses
have high optical transparency or low absorptivity in the visible
range.41,42

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption spectra of hybrid silica
wires prepared
(a) without surfactant, (b) using 40 and 80 μL of green surfactant
(GS: N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract),
and (c) using 40 and 80 μL of chemical surfactant (CS: C8TMOS).

The silica wires prepared without
any surfactant show absorption
bands at 235 nm (Figure 6a). The silica wires prepared by 40 and 80 μL of natural surfactant
(N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract) show
absorption bands at 226 and 230 nm, respectively (Figure 6b), whereas those prepared
by 40 and 80 μL of chemical surfactant (C8TMOS) show
strong bands at 238 and 243 nm, respectively (Figure 6c). The observed red shift suggests a reduction
in the band gap upon increasing the amount of surfactant. The reduction
in the band gap is related to the increased silica particle size upon
increasing the amount of surfactant,42 which
is also evident by close networking of hybrid silica wires observed
in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results.

SEM Analysis
The
surface analysis by scanning electron
microscopy (JEOL: JSM-6480) shows the branched silica wire structure,
with no cross-linked network and having smaller surface-to-volume
ratios43 for the sample prepared using
40 μL of C8TMOS, as shown in Figure 7a. It is obvious that silica wires consist
of a Si core (dark in color) covered by a silicon oxide shell (bright
in color) (Figure 7b). This chemically inert Si oxide shell prevents the lateral growth
of Si wires and thus the perpendicular growth of the wires has shaped
them into a branched structure, as shown in Figure 7a.44 This less
self-assembled structure can be attributed to the comparatively lower
hydrophobicity than that of the sample prepared using 80 μL
of C8TMOS. The latter showed a more self-assembled porous
network of silica having larger surface-to-volume ratios, as shown
in Figure 7c.45 The resulting hierarchal surface is sufficiently
rough to provide superhydrophobicity in the form of microscopic air
pockets.46 The improved hydrophobicity
by increasing the amount of surfactant is also evident by the results
of contact angle measurements.

Figure 7 SEM images of hybrid silica wires prepared
(a, b) using 40 μL
of chemical and natural surfactant (C8TMOS) and (c, d)
using 80 μL of chemical and natural surfactant (C8TMOS).

Conclusions
Silica
films were successfully synthesized in the absence of any
surfactant and using green surfactant (N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract) and chemical surfactant (trimethoxyoctylsilane
(C8TMOS)). Water contact angles (CA) of both hybrid silica
films prepared on cellulose acetate filter paper and those on the
glass substrate showed an enhancement in water repellency on increasing
the amount of surfactant. However, the improvement by increasing the
amount of surfactant is more prominent (up to 24° rise in CA)
in the case of films over glass slides. However, overall the water
repellency was outstanding in the case of films on cellulose acetate
filter (CA = 154°) paper, which endowed them with superhydrophobicity,9 suggesting that the coatings are highly water resistant, as already reported for
rough substrates such as filter paper, cotton cloths,47 and paper surface.48 TGA/DSC
analysis showed that silica wires prepared without surfactant showed
no phase change in the range 0–200 °C, whereas those synthesized
with surfactants require the temperature up to 170 °C to change
the phase. The red shift observed in UV–vis spectra of hybrid
silica wires upon increasing the number of surfactants (in both green
and chemical cases) indicates the increased particle size, which is
evident by close porous mesh of silica wires in spectra of SEM analysis.

Thus, the hybrid silica wires prepared exhibit good transparency,
low surface energy, and superhydrophobicity. These prepared transparent
silica wire assemblies provide exceptional opportunities in developing
materials with hierarchical structures for multifunctionalities such
as superhydrophobic coatings for waterproof electronic devices, military
uniforms, self-cleaning surfaces, etc. Also, silica sieves or membranes
are emerging candidates for several potential applications involving
adsorption and molecular separations due to their large surface areas,
high pore volumes, and tunable pore sizes.49 Detailed studies on using the silica wire assemblies as coatings,
substrates, or sacrificial templates are in progress for numerous
applications such as separation devices, nanocatalysis, sensors, biomedical
applications, and fuel cells.49,50 The current work opens
a new door toward nontoxic, environmentally friendly, and low-cost
silica assemblies for various such applications.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Hybrid Silica Wires and Films
In a typical
synthesis, 2 g of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (C6H9NO)n was dissolved in 20 mL of n-butanol in a 250 mL flask. After that, 2 mL of ethanol,
0.56 mL of distilled water, 1.36 mL of sodium citrate solution (Na3C6H5O7), and 0.40 mL of ammonia
(NH3) solution were added sequentially. The mixture was
shaken by hand for 2–3 min after each chemical addition. Finally,
a mixture of 200 μL of TEOS and green (N. nucifera/lotus leaf extract) or chemical (trimethoxy(octyl)silane (C8TMOS): C11H26O3Si) surfactant
was added to the above mixture for cross-linkage between water and
oil medium and to provide silica.20 The
mixture was shaken for 5 min immediately and left static for 22 h
at 37 °C to grow silica wires (SiWs). The sample was then sonicated
(DSA100-SK1-2.8L, V = 220 V, P =
100 W, 50 Hz) for 1 h and centrifuged (PLC-3, P =
220 V/50 Hz, 0.65 A) at 4500 rpm for 60 min to separate SiWs in a
15 mL centrifugation tube. The hybrid SiWs were washed with ethanol
three times, air-dried for 2 days, and finally used to prepare a suspension
of 20 mg/mL concentration of silica in ethanol.16 Two different samples were synthesized of each of the surfactant
using two different amounts, i.e.
40 and 80 μL.

Silica Wire Assembly on Filter Paper
Vacuum filtration
(Rocker: 300 C-VG 12) was performed to coat the hybrid silica film
on cellulose acetate filter paper. In a typical procedure, the above-prepared
suspension of silica wires was filtered through a cellulose acetate
filter paper (pore size, 0.40 μm) to form an interwoven silica
wire assembly on the filter paper. After washing with ethanol twice,
the hybrid silica film on the filter paper substrate was air-dried.

Silica Wire Assembly on Glass Substrate
The dip-coating
method was applied using a Dip Master TM-100 dip-coater to assemble
silica wire films on the glass substrate. In a typical procedure,
the already cleaned glass substrate with dimensions of 3 cm ×
1 cm was dipped in the silica wire suspension for 10 s and then pulled
out by using the dip-coater. The films were then air-dried. The schematics
of the whole process is illustrated in the schematic diagram, Figure 8.

Flocculation
Test
When the suspension of silica wires
was prepared in distilled water, flocculation occurred, which indicated
the water repellency property of the synthesized silica wires.14

Figure 8 Schematic process for preparing hybrid silica wires by
the sol–gel
method and their assembly as transparent hybrid films on cellulose
acetate filter paper and glass substrate.

Preparation of Nelumbo nucifera/Lotus
Leaf Extract
First, 25 g of crushed N. nucifera/lotus leaves were dipped in 100 mL of n-hexane
for 24 h in a 500 mL air-tight beaker, to prevent n-hexane from evaporation. The greenish extract was then
filtered and left open in air to evaporate n-hexane,
and finally a yellowish green extract was obtained.23

Chemical Reactions
Sodium citrate
was added to the
mixture to stabilize the emulsion. When it reacted with ammonia, which
was used to control the pH of the chemical reaction, first, the solution
got acidic due to free H+ ions obtained from H2O and the solution became slightly acidic. Then, sodium citrate turned
to citric acid. When sodium citrate reacted with ammonia, ammonium
citrate was formed and no free H+ ions were present in
the solution.

By the sol–gel process, TEOS
produced the silica nanoparticles
by the following steps:

Early intermediates result from two
partially hydrolyzed monomers
linked with a siloxane [Si–O–Si] bond  Due to anisotropic
deposition, which was caused
by hydrolyzed TEOS, Si nanoparticles were produced in half an hour,
inside the droplets of H2O. The Si nanoparticles deposited
at the edge of the water droplets to reduce the surface energy for
attaining superhydrophobicity. It is important to know that superhydrophobicity
and surface energy are inversely proportional to each other. One side
of the Si nanoparticles was attached to the oil medium and the other
side with water medium. The growth of silica by sol–gel occurred
only in water medium. The hydrolyzed TEOS was stabilized by sodium
citrate. TEOS was passed through sodium citrate into the water medium
to react with the silica nanoparticles.

When was C8TMOS added, it was dissolved in n-butanol (oil phase)
and hydrolyzed into C8Si(O–)3, when it came across water medium. C8Si(O–)3 joined itself by its hydrophilic side,
i.e., the Si(O–)3 ion with water and
its hydrophilic tail, i.e., C8 with n-butanol.
This fact proved that it has amphiphilic character. Due to this behavior
of C8Si(O–)3 as a surfactant,
the surface tension of water droplets was minimized and they joined with SiO2 nanoparticles.
Thus, polymerization is associated with the formation of a 1-, 2-,
or 3-dimensional network of siloxane [Si–O–Si] bonds
accompanied by the production of H–O–H and R–O–H
species. Condensation liberates a small molecule, such as water or
alcohol. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger
silicon-containing molecules by the process of polymerization. Thus,
a polymer is a huge molecule (or macromolecule) formed from hundreds
or thousands of units called monomers. The number of bonds that a
monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of silicon
alkoxide, for instance, can lead to complex branching of the polymer
because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)4 is tetrafunctional
(can branch or bond in four different directions). Alternatively,
under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration), fewer than
four of the OR or OH groups (ligands) will be capable of condensation,
so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis
and condensation and the factors that result in bias toward linear or branched structures are the most
critical issues of sol–gel science and technology. This reaction
is favored in both basic and acidic conditions. The hydrolysis of
TEOS molecules forms silanol groups. The condensation/polymerization
between the silanol groups or between silanol groups and ethoxy groups
creates siloxane bridges (Si–O–Si) that form the entire
silica structure.
