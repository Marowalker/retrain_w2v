Selective
transformation of levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone
(GVL) using novel heterogeneous catalysts is one of the promising
strategies for viable biomass processing. In this framework, we developed
a continuous flow process for the selective hydrogenation of LA to
GVL using several nanostructured Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The
structural, textural, acidic, and redox properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts, tuned by selectively varying the Ni amount from 5 to
40 wt %, were critically investigated using numerous materials characterization
techniques. Electron microscopy images showed the formation of uniformly
dispersed Ni nanoparticles on the SiO2 support, up to 30%
Ni loading (average particle size is 9.2 nm), followed by a drastic
increase in the particles size (21.3 nm) for 40% Ni-loaded catalyst.
The fine dispersion of Ni particles has elicited a synergistic metal–support
interaction, especially in 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst, resulting
in enhanced acidic and redox properties. Among the various catalysts
tested, the 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed the best performance
with a remarkable 98% selectivity of GVL at complete conversion of
LA for 2 h reaction time. Interestingly, this catalyst showed a steady
selectivity to GVL (>97%), with a 54.5% conversion of LA during
20
h time-on-stream. The best performance of 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst
was attributed to well-balanced catalytic properties, such as ample
amounts of strong acidic sites and abundant active metal sites. The
obtained results show a great potential of applying earth-abundant
nickel/silica catalysts for upgrading biomass platform molecules into
value-added chemicals and high-energy-density fuels.

1 Introduction
Efficient
upgrading of biomass-derived platform molecules to chemicals
and biofuels has received tremendous attention in view of carbon-neutral
society and a more sustainable economy.1−8 Levulinic acid (LA) is one of the promising biomass derivatives
that can be largely obtained via cellulose hydrolysis reaction.9,10 Owing to two versatile functional groups (ketone and acid), LA can
be transformed into a variety of valuable chemicals, such as γ-valerolactone
(GVL), 1,4-pentanediol, succinic acid, 3-hydroxypropanoic acid, and
2-methyltetrahydrofuran.11 In particular,
the selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL is a vital step in biomass
processing. GVL is an appealing chemical for the synthesis of 1,4-pentanediol,
2-methyltetrahydrofuran, adipic acid, biofuels, and fuel additives.8,12−15 GVL can also be used as a solvent for biomass conversion reactions,
as a precursor for the production of food additives and drugs as well
as a gasoline blender.16,17 In addition, GVL is an important
chemical for the synthesis of monomers used in the manufacturing of
nylon and other important polymers.18

Various homogeneous noble-metal-based catalysts, such as RuCl2(PPh3)3, Ru(acac)3 ligated
with PBu3, tris(3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine (TPPTS), P(Oct)3, RuCl3 in combination with PPh3 or
TPPTS, and [Ir(COE)2Cl]2 are reported to show
a high catalytic performance in LA to GVL transformation.19−25 However, homogeneous catalysts have several disadvantages in terms
of synthesis, cost, toxicity, stability, and recovery/reusability.
Alternatively, heterogeneous solid catalysts could offer great potentials
for viable biomass upgrading, attributed to their versatile benefits,
such as low production costs, strong hydrothermal stability, and efficient
recovery/reusability. Recent works demonstrated that Ru-based solid
catalysts show a good activity in LA-to-GVL transformation, compared
to other noble-metal-based catalysts (Pd, Pt, Ir, or Au).26−31 For instance, Tukacs et al.31 investigated
the performance of three different catalysts (Pd/C, Ru/C, and Raney
Ni) for LA hydrogenation. Among them, Ru/C catalyst showed high LA
conversion (82.9%) and GVL yield (97.5%). In another work, Upare et
al.32 reported that the Ru/C catalyst exhibits
a 98.6% yield of GVL, while about 90 and 30% yields of GVL over Pd/C
and Pt/C catalysts, respectively. However, high cost of Ru metal could
limit the practical applications of Ru-based catalysts, which stimulated
the search for promising non-noble-metal catalysts not only for LA-to-GVL
transformation, but also for other vital reactions in biomass processing.

The catalytic performance of several earth-abundant transition
metals (Ni, Cu, Fe, or Co) deposited on high-surface-area supporting
materials has been investigated for the hydrogenation of LA to GVL
in liquid phase.26,33−37 However, leaching of active metal species is a key
concern in the liquid-phase (high-pressure) reactions, resulting in
low stability of the catalyst and a futile reusability. Performing
the catalytic reactions in a continuous flow vapor-phase system could
provide promising solutions to overcome the drawbacks associated with
the liquid-phase reactions. Numerous research efforts have been recently
attempted toward developing Ni-based catalysts for continuous flow
LA hydrogenation, attributed to their attractive structural and redox
properties, along with the economic and stability advantages. For
example, Sun et al.38 studied the vapor-phase
hydrogenation of LA and methyl levulinate over Cu/Al2O3, Ni/SiO2, and Co/SiO2 catalysts (20
wt % metal loading). Among them, the Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed
the best performance in LA hydrogenation, with a 85.7% yield of GVL.
Hengst et al.39 found that 5 wt % Ni/Al2O3 catalyst prepared by a wet-impregnation method
shows a good activity in continuous flow LA hydrogenation (90% LA
conversion and 75% GVL yield). In a recent work, Yoshida et al.40 have investigated the effect of the preparation
method on the structure–activity properties of bimetallic Cu–Ni/SiO2 catalysts, prepared using 4 and 16 wt % loadings of Cu and
Ni, respectively, for vapor-phase LA hydrogenation. The above studies
demonstrate that the properties of Ni catalysts and their role in
tailoring the conversion/selectivity in continuous flow LA hydrogenation
may strongly depend on the metal composition. The key reason for this
observation is that metal composition can determine the dispersion
of active sites as well as metal–support interaction toward
selective hydrogenation of LA to GVL product.

On the basis of
the above background, we developed nanostructured
Ni/SiO2 catalysts without using any base and organic protective
agents. Stabilization of smaller metal nanoparticles, which are determined
to be active sites for several catalytic reactions, on the catalyst
surface remains a foremost challenge against the application of high-temperature
(HT) conditions, but it is crucial for obtaining improved reaction
rates as well as highly durable catalysts. Owing to high specific
surface area and excellent thermal stability, silica as a support
can stabilize nanosized metal particles by controlling their aggregation
at high-temperature conditions via strong metal–support interactions.
Hence, in this work, we have chosen silica as a support for the preparation
of nanostructured Ni-based catalysts. The structural, morphology,
acidic, and redox properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts, tuned
by varying the Ni loading from 5 to 40 wt % based on the SiO2 support, were systematically analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), H2 pulse chemisorption, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area techniques. The performance of nanostructured Ni/SiO2 catalysts was studied for continuous flow LA hydrogenation
at mild reaction conditions. The effects of reaction temperature,
reaction time, and concentration of LA were optimized to obtain good
catalytic results in terms of LA conversion and GVL selectivity. Much
attention has been paid to correlate the properties of nanostructured
Ni/SiO2 materials with their catalytic activity in continuous
flow LA hydrogenation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization Studies
Powder XRD
profiles of Ni/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Figure 1. All catalysts exhibit various
XRD peaks at 2θ = 36.6, 42.7, 62.2, 74.8, and 79.2°, which
can be assigned to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) crystal facets
of NiO, respectively.41,42 In addition, a broad peak is
observed at 2θ = 22°, which reveals the presence of amorphous
SiO2.41 Interestingly, the intensity
of the XRD peaks increases with the increase of Ni loading, which
indicates greater crystallinity and larger crystallite size in higher
Ni loading catalysts.42 To understand this,
the average NiO crystallite size of the catalysts was calculated using
the Debye–Scherrer equation (Table 1). It was found that crystallite size increases
gradually up to 30% Ni loading and then shows a rapid increase for
40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst (13.68 nm). This indicates that the
crystal growth of NiO can be controlled up to 30% Ni loading, a key
criterion for achieving abundant surface-exposed active sites. Powder
XRD patterns of reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Figure S1. The diffraction peaks noted at 2θ
= 44.49, 51.85, and 76.38° can be indexed to the (111), (200),
and (220) crystal facets of metallic Ni with a face-centered cubic
structure, respectively.12,43 Here also, the average
crystallite size of metallic Ni for all of the reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts was estimated using the Debye–Scherrer equation
(Table 1). A similar
trend was noted between the Ni crystallite size of the reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts and the NiO crystallite sizes obtained for the
as-synthesized Ni/SiO2 catalysts, i.e., 40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a larger crystallite size under both reduced
and nonreduced treatments.

XPS
analysis has been undertaken to estimate oxidation states of
the elements as well as to understand metal–support interactions
in Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The Ni 2p XPS images of Ni/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Figure 2. Two major peaks were noted at 854.9 and 872.6 eV,
corresponding to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2.44−46 The estimated splitting between Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 XPS peaks of Ni2+ was found to 18.4 eV, which
is well correlated with the literature reports.46,47 In addition, two shake-up satellite peaks were observed at 861.3
and 879.2 eV, which confirm the +2 oxidation state of Ni species in
the developed Ni/SiO2 catalysts.44,48 As shown in Figure 2, Ni 2p3/2 peak is split into two peaks: the first peak
at 854.3 eV is attributed to Ni2+species present within
the NiO phase and the second peak at 856 eV is assigned to Ni2+ species present in the composite oxide material.47,48 This observation indicates the existence of different types of Ni2+ species in the Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The O 1s XPS
images of Ni/SiO2 catalysts are presented in Figure 3. The peak observed at 529.6
eV corresponds to lattice oxygen ions bonded to Ni cations, whereas
the peak noted at 532.4–533.1 eV indicates O2– species in the SiO2 support (i.e., Si–O–Si
environment).49−51 The O 1s XPS peak of Si–O in Ni/SiO2 catalysts is shifted to lower binding energies compared to that
of pure SiO2, which reveals the charge transfer from Si
to O in Ni/SiO2 catalysts.52 The Si 2p XPS images of Ni/SiO2 catalysts are shown in Figure 2S, Supporting Information. A major XPS
peak was noted at around 103.1–103.7 eV, which indicates the
presence of Si4+ species in the Ni/SiO2 catalysts.53 The intensity of the Si 2p peak gradually decreases
with the increase of Ni loading, which was due to the coverage of
SiO2 surface by Ni phase at higher Ni loadings.51

and (e) 40% Ni/SiO2 catalysts.

SiO2 sample.

The morphology, particle size, and the size distribution
of NiO
and SiO2 for all catalysts were estimated using TEM and
scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectrometry
(STEM-EDS) studies. Figure 4 shows the TEM images of 5% Ni/SiO2, 30% Ni/SiO2, and 40% Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Irregular shaped SiO2 nanoparticles were formed in all Ni/SiO2 catalysts.
As shown in Figure 4, a number of tiny NiO particles (black dots) were found in 5% Ni/SiO2 and 30% Ni/SiO2 catalysts. In contrast, largely
agglomerated particles were noted in 40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst.
To understand this, the size of the NiO particles was estimated and
the obtained data are summarized in histograms, as shown in Figure 4. It was noted that
40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst contains larger particles (average
value is 20.3 nm) with a broad size distribution, compared to 5% Ni/SiO2 (7.5 nm) and 30% Ni/SiO2 (9.2 nm) catalysts. This
observation is well correlated with the crystallite sizes estimated
from the XRD studies (Table 1). With the aim of confirming these results, STEM-EDS characterization
was performed and the obtained images are shown in Figure 5. It is clearly noted that
30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits homogeneous dispersion of
Ni and Si species. This is a key criterion for achieving promising
active sites (particularly, enhanced redox properties) not only for
LA hydrogenation, but also for other vital catalytic reactions. Irrespective
of Ni loading, smaller nanoparticles were found on the surface of
SiO2 support, as evidenced by TEM studies (Figures 4 and 5), especially in the case of 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst. The
absence of macroscopic metal particles indicates beneficial effect
of SiO2 support in stabilizing nanosized particles against
higher calcination conditions. The BET surface areas of Ni/SiO2 catalysts are presented in Table 1. It was obvious that the BET surface area
of Ni/SiO2 catalysts slightly decreases up to 30% Ni loading
and then a drastic decrease for 40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst. This
observation is due to the agglomeration of NiO particles at higher
Ni loadings, which was evident from the both crystallite sizes (Figure 1 and Table 1) and particle sizes (Figures 4 and 5) estimated for all of the catalysts.

The reduction behavior of Ni species in Ni/SiO2 catalysts,
a determinant factor for choosing promising catalysts for LA hydrogenation,
is estimated using H2-TPR analysis (Figure 6). In addition, this analysis allows to qualitatively
evaluate the metal–support interaction in the supported metal
catalysts.54−56 All catalysts show a major peak centered at 850 K,
along with a shoulder-like peak at around 1022 K (Figure 6). These peaks suggest the
existence of different types of NiO species interacting with the SiO2 support.57 The high-intensity
peak noted at 850 K indicates the reduction of NiO interacting with
the SiO2 support.58 This peak
intensity gradually increases with the increase of Ni loading. Another
peak observed at 1022 K can be attributed to the reduction of nickel
silicate species.42 These nickel silicate
species could strongly interact with the support and hence, their
reduction is only possible at higher temperatures. The results of
active metal surface area (Table 1) revealed that 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows
a larger amount of H2 consumption. This observation indicates
the existence of high concentration of active metal sites in the 30%
Ni/SiO2 catalyst.59

Figure 6 H2-TPR studies of synthesized Ni/SiO2 catalysts.

The acidic properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts
were investigated
using NH3-TPD analysis (Figure 7). Various NH3-TPD peaks were
found for all of the catalysts, indicating the presence of different
types of acidic sites. To define the strength of the acidic sites
present in the Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the NH3-TPD
profiles can be categorized as low-temperature (LT) and high-temperature
(HT) regions, before and after 673 K, respectively. The LT region
peak reveals the presence of weak acid sites, whereas the HT region
peak corresponds to strong acidic sites. It is evident from Figure 7 that the intensity
of LT region peak decreases with the increase of Ni loading. Interestingly,
the intensity of HT region peak increased up to 30% Ni loading and
then showed a sudden decrease for 40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst.
To understand this, the concentration of acidic sites is estimated
for all of the catalysts (Table 1). Among them, 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits
high concentration of acidic sites (192 μmol/g), which could
play a key role in the LA hydrogenation, as discussed in the following
paragraphs.

2.2 Continuous Flow Hydrogenation of Levulinic
Acid
Figure 8 shows the catalytic activity results obtained for LA-to-GVL transformation
as a function of reaction time over the Ni/SiO2 catalysts.
The reaction conditions are 30 mL/min H2 flow, 523 K reaction
temperature, 1 g of catalyst, and 1 mL/h LA feed rate. Among the catalysts
tested, 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows a 100% LA conversion
at 2 h reaction time, whereas only 40, 61.9, 80.3, and 91.5% LA conversions
were achieved for 5% Ni/SiO2, 10% Ni/SiO2, 20%
Ni/SiO2, and 40% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, respectively.
However, the conversion of LA continuously decreases with reaction
time for all of the catalysts, which could be due to the blockage
of active sites by the reaction substrates and/or coke formation.
However, the unique feature of 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst is
that it shows a steady conversion of LA from 16 (59.8%) to even after
20 h reaction time (57%). This stable LA conversion was not achieved
over the remaining catalysts. As shown in Figure 8B, LA is mainly converted into the GVL product,
with the considerable amounts of angelica lactones and pentanoic acid
products (Scheme 1).
For 2 h reaction time, 5% Ni/SiO2 catalyst shows 60% selectivity
to GVL and the remaining Ni/SiO2 catalysts show more than
96% selectivity of GVL. Interestingly, there was not much difference
in GVL selectivity up to 6 h reaction time for 10% Ni/SiO2, 20% Ni/SiO2, 30% Ni/SiO2, and 40% Ni/SiO2 catalysts. After 6 h reaction time, the selectivity of the
GVL is found to decrease for 10% Ni/SiO2 and 20% Ni/SiO2 catalysts, whereas 30% Ni/SiO2 and 40% Ni/SiO2 catalysts exhibit a stable selectivity to GVL (95.1 and 95.4%,
respectively) up to 12 h reaction time. Afterward, a drastic decrease
in GVL selectivity was noted over 40% Ni/SiO2 catalyst
(70.1%), whereas there was no much variation in GVL selectivity (93.2%)
for 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst even after 20 h reaction time.
Therefore, among all of the catalysts tested, 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits the best performance in terms of LA conversion
and GVL selectivity. Importantly, this catalyst showed a stable performance
for GVL selectivity even after 20 h reaction time, which is crucial
for the practical application of earth-abundant Ni/SiO2 catalysts, not only for continuous flow LA hydrogenation, but also
for other vital reactions in biomass upgrading.

Figure 8 (A) Conversion of levulinic
acid (LA) and (B) selectivity to γ-valerolactone
(GVL) obtained over nanostructured Ni/SiO2 catalysts in
LA hydrogenation. Reaction conditions: 30 mL/min H2 flow,
523 K reaction temperature, 1 g of catalyst, and 1 mL/h LA feed rate.

Scheme 1 Plausible Reaction Pathway for Continuous
Flow Hydrogenation of Levulinic
Acid To Produce γ-Valerolactone
To study the variation of LA conversion and GVL selectivity
with
the reaction temperature, we have studied the hydrogenation of LA
at different reaction temperatures from 498, 523 to 548 K over the
30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst (Figure 9). It was found that the reaction temperature
plays a significant role in the LA hydrogenation. Results reveal that
the conversion of LA is very low (59.1%) at 498 K reaction temperature
for 2 h reaction time, whereas a 100% LA conversion is obtained at
523 and 548 K reaction temperatures. With the increase of reaction
time, the conversion of LA is found to decrease at all reaction temperatures.
At 498 K reaction temperature, a drastic decrease in LA conversion
is noted (5.2% for 20 h reaction time). In contrast, the LA conversion
decreases gradually at 523 and 548 K reaction temperatures, with 57
and 63.9% conversions of LA for 20 h reaction time, respectively.
This indicates the necessity of the reaction temperate higher than
498 K for achieving maximum conversion of LA under continuous flow
conditions. Interesting results were observed toward GVL selectivity.
For 2 h reaction time, a high selectivity of GVL is obtained at all
reaction temperatures. Interestingly, the GVL selectivity (93%) is
maintained with the reaction time at 523 K reaction temperature. In
contrast, a poor selectivity (22%) of GVL (the remaining byproducts
are pentanoic acid, 1-pentanol, 1,4-pentanediol, and methyltetrahydrofuran)
is obtained at 548 K reaction temperature for 20 h reaction time.
At 498 K reaction temperature, the selectivity of GVL notably decreased
from 12 to 20 h of reaction time and only a 49.2% selectivity of GVL
is obtained after 20 h reaction time. These results therefore demonstrate
that a better catalytic result in terms of LA conversion and GVL selectivity
were achieved at 523 K reaction temperature.

Figure 9 Effect of reaction temperature
on the conversion of levulinic acid
(A) and the selectivity of γ-valerolactone (B) over 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst as a function of reaction time in levulinic acid
hydrogenation. Reaction conditions: 30 mL/min H2 flow,
1 g catalyst, and 1 mL/h LA feed rate. LA—levulinic acid and
GVL—γ-valerolactone.

We have also studied the effect of LA feed rate (0.5 and
1.0 mL/h)
on the continuous flow hydrogenation of LA to GVL as a function of
reaction time (20 h) using 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst (Figure 10). The obtained
LA conversions at 2 and 20 h reaction times are 100 and 80.4% for
0.5 mL/h of LA feed rate, while 99.6 and 54.5% of LA conversions were
obtained for 1 mL/h of LA feed rate, respectively. These results clearly
indicate a high and steady conversion of LA at 0.5 mL/h of LA feed
rate. On the other hand, the selectivity of the GVL was independent
of the feed rate of LA. The obtained GVL selectivities for 0.5 and
1 mL/h feed rates of LA were 92.7 and ∼93% at 20 h reaction
time, respectively.

the selectivity of γ-valerolactone (GVL) over 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst as a function of reaction time. Reaction conditions:
30 mL/min H2 flow, 523 K reaction temperature, and 1 g
of catalyst.

The hydrogenation of
LA to GVL typically follows two reaction pathways:
(i) angelica lactones pathway and (ii) 4-hydroxypentanoic acid pathway.13,26,60,61 However, both reaction pathways require well-balanced acidic and
active metal sites. In the angelica lactones pathway, the acidic sites
of the catalyst initiate the dehydration of LA to form intermediate
products (angelica lactones). Further hydrogenation of these intermediates
over the metallic Ni sites yields the GVL product. In contrast, active
metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of LA to 4-hydroxypentanoic acid intermediate
occurred in another reaction pathway, as shown in Scheme 1. The subsequent cyclization
of this intermediate to produce GVL is catalyzed by acidic sites.
The detailed physicochemical characterization studies revealed the
presence of both acidic and active metal sites in the investigated
Ni/SiO2 catalysts (Table 1). The formation of angelica lactones reveals that
the LA hydrogenation follows the angelica lactones pathway over Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Simultaneously, pentanoic acid is also formed
in LA hydrogenation, which is due to the dehydration–hydrogenation
reactions of 4-hydroxypentanoic acid.13,26,60 Hence, both reaction pathways (Scheme 1) are possible for continuous flow LA hydrogenation
over Ni/SiO2 catalysts. By comparing the activity data
with the characterization studies, a clear structure–activity
correlation of Ni/SiO2 catalysts was achieved for continuous
flow LA hydrogenation. As shown in Figure 11, 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst contains
higher amounts of acidic and active metal sites, resulting in higher
yields of GVL from LA hydrogenation. This is because both acidic and
active metal sites play a favorable role in LA hydrogenation (Scheme 1). Although SiO2 could not show a direct effect on the hydrogenation of levulinic
acid, due to the lack of catalytic active sites, it is essential for
obtaining finely dispersed active phase nanoparticles, which was clearly
noted in the present study (Figures 4 and 5). As a result, adequate
amounts of redox (Figure 6) and acid (Figure 7) properties were found in the nanostructured Ni/SiO2 catalysts, which played a considerable effect in the LA hydrogenation
to selectively obtain GVL product. The better performance of 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst, along with the economic and the stability benefits
of nickel and silica, could enable it a new appealing catalyst for
various important hydroprocessing reactions in biomass upgrading.

correlations of Ni/SiO2 catalysts
for γ-valerolactone (GVL) yields obtained from levulinic acid
hydrogenation under continuous flow conditions.

To understand the key reasons for the observed catalyst deactivation
in LA hydrogenation, XRD and TEM studies of used 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst were carried out (Figure 12) and the obtained results were compared to those of
fresh catalyst. As shown in Figure 12A, both reduced and used 30% Ni/SiO2 catalysts
show similar XRD patterns in terms of diffraction angle and peak intensity.
It indicates that the crystal structure of nickel is unaffected by
the employed reaction conditions in LA hydrogenation. However, largely
aggregated Ni particles with a broad size distribution (15.2 nm of
mean particle size) were found in the used 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst.
It was already noted that fresh 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst contains
finely dispersed nanoparticles with a 9.2 nm of mean particle size
(Figure 4). Hence,
it appears that the increased particle size of 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst is one of the key reasons for the catalyst deactivation
in LA hydrogenation. The development of supported bimetallic catalysts,
such as Ni–Cu/SiO2, would be a promising solution
for improving catalyst’s stability as well as for achieving
durable results in terms of conversion/selectivity in the hydrogenation
of levulinic acid. This is because the addition of another metal to
Ni may provide synergistic metal–metal interactions, due to
the active interplay of electron transfer at the interface structures.
Hence, large amounts of redox properties near the vicinity of the
interfaces can be obtained in the supported bimetallic catalysts.
In addition, synergistic Cu–Ni nanoalloys dispersed on a high-surface-area
support like SiO2 could show high resistance to particle
sintering compared to the individual nanoparticles and hence, improved
stability of supported nanoalloys against higher-temperature conditions.
Therefore, the application of supported nanoalloy catalysts in biomass
valorization could overcome the drawbacks associated with the supported
monometallic catalysts.

3 Conclusions
A continuous flow process
was developed for the selective conversion
of LA to GVL over a variety of nanostructured Ni/SiO2 catalysts.
Among them, the 30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibits the best
performance in terms of LA conversion and GVL selectivity. The activity
order of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in LA hydrogenation is 5% Ni/SiO2 < 10% Ni/SiO2 < 20% Ni/SiO2 <
40% Ni/SiO2 < 30% Ni/SiO2. Importantly, the
30% Ni/SiO2 catalyst showed a stable selectivity to GVL
(>97%), with a 54.5% conversion of LA during 20 h time-on-stream.
The systematic characterization of the catalysts reveals a strong
dependence of textural, acidic, and redox properties on the Ni loading.
A linear correlation between the acidic-active metal sites and the
GVL yield was achieved in this study. Characterization of used 30%
Ni/SiO2 catalyst reveals the formation of largely aggregated
particles with a broad size distribution, which might be the reason
for the catalyst deactivation in LA hydrogenation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Nanostructured
Ni/SiO2 catalysts with various Ni loadings from 5 to 40
wt % (with respect to SiO2) were synthesized using a modified
wetness impregnation method. In a typical procedure, an appropriate
amount of colloidal SiO2 (Aldrich, AR grade) was dispersed
in double-distilled water under mild stirring conditions, followed
by the addition of a required quantity of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich, AR grade) dissolved in aqueous medium.
The mixture solution was stirred at 400 rpm for 20 min at 333 K before
the temperature was raised to 373 K and stirred until the liquid had
evaporated. The obtained samples were oven-dried at 373 K for 12 h
and then calcined in static air at 773 K for 5 h with a heating ramp
of 5 K/min. For convenience, the catalysts prepared using 5, 10, 20,
30, and 40 wt % of Ni loadings are labeled as 5% Ni/SiO2, 10% Ni/SiO2, 20% Ni/SiO2, 30% Ni/SiO2, and 40% Ni/SiO2, respectively.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffractograms of Ni/SiO2 catalysts were recorded
using a Rigaku diffractometer, equipped with a Cu Kα radiation
(0.1540 nm) source, operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Diffractograms were
collected over a 2θ range of 10–80°, with a step
size of 0.02° and a step time of 2.4 s.

The BET surface area, pore size, and pore
volume of Ni/SiO2 catalysts were obtained via N2 adsorption–desorption studies carried out using a Micromeritics
ASAP 2020 instrument at liquid N2 temperature (77 K). Prior
to analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum at 573 K for 3
h to remove residual moisture and other volatile species adsorbed
on the catalyst surface.

The oxidation states of Ni, O, and
Si elements in the Ni/SiO2 catalysts were estimated using
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis. For this, a VG Scientific ESCALAB-210 spectrometer
was used with Mg Kα radiation (photon energy of 1253.6 eV) as
the X-ray source. The adventitious C 1s peak at 284.6 eV was used
for the charge correction of the binding energies obtained for Ni
2p, O 1s, and Si 2p spectra.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) experiments were performed
to estimate particle size and its distribution in Ni/SiO2 catalysts. For this, a Tecnai G2 TEM microscope equipped with a
slow scan charge-coupled device camera and operating at an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV was used. Sample preparation involves sonication
of about 10 mg of catalyst in acetone for 5 min before deposition
onto a holey carbon-coated copper grid.

The reducible nature
of Ni/SiO2 catalysts was estimated
using H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis performed over a Micromeritics model AutoChem 2910
instrument. For this analysis, the required amount of calcined catalyst
(about 50 mg) was placed into a quartz tubular reactor. The reactor
was then gradually heated up to 573 K (5 °C/min) in He flow (30
mL/min). The temperature of the reactor was maintained at 573 K for
another 60 min to completely remove hydroxyl and other volatile species
adsorbed on the catalyst surface. Afterward, the reactor was slowly
cooled to 313 K, followed by switching of the gas flow to 10% H2 in Ar (30 mL/min). Finally, the temperature of the reactor
was increased to 1073 K at a heating ramp of 5 K/min. The purified
gas, obtained after removing water molecules from the reactor effluent
gas using a molecular sieve trap, was analyzed by gas chromatography
(GC), equipped with a thermal conductivity detector.

The active
metal surface area of Ni/SiO2 catalysts was
estimated using H2 pulse chemisorption experiments performed
over a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Prior to analysis,
the Ni/SiO2 catalyst was reduced at 973 K for 1 h under
10% H2/Ar atmosphere (30 mL/min flow). After cooling the
reactor to room temperature under Ar flow, H2 pulses were
immediately injected until the eluted peak areas of at least three
successive pulses become constant. The active surface area of Ni in
Ni/SiO2 catalysts was estimated from H2 volume
adsorbed on the catalyst surface by assuming the value of H/Ni (surface
nickel atom) is one and a surface area of 6.5 × 10 to 20 m2 per Ni atom.  where Vchem (mol/g)
is the chemisorption volume; σNi (nm2)
is the Ni cross section area; and SF is the stoichiometry factor.

The acidic strength of Ni/SiO2 catalysts was determined
using NH3-TPD analysis carried out on a Micromeritics AutoChem
2910 instrument, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. About
30 mg of catalyst was initially preactivated at 573 K for 1 h to remove
adsorbed moisture and other volatile species from the catalyst surface
and then, the reactor was cooled to 323 K. Afterward, 4.95% NH3 gas balanced with He (20 mL/min flow rate) was passed through
the catalyst surface for 60 min. The physisorbed NH3 was
immediately removed from the catalyst surface by flushing with He
gas. The chemisorbed amount of NH3 was then estimated in
He flow (20 mL/min) while gradually increasing the reactor temperature
from 323 to 1073 K (10 K/min).

4.3 Catalytic
Activity Performance
The
catalytic activity measurements for continuous flow LA (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.9%) hydrogenation were carried out in a down flow fixed-bed reactor
under atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, the mixture of
1 g of catalyst and 1 g of quartz particles was placed in a tubular
reactor and held between two end plugs of quartz wool. The reaction
bed temperature was monitored at the wall of reactor with a type K
thermocouple and controlled with a programmable temperature controller.
In each experiment, the catalyst was reduced in situ for 6 h at 873
K temperature in 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min). Afterward, the
reactor was cooled to a desired reaction bed temperature and LA was
fed into the vaporizer at a flow rate of 0.5 or 1 mL/h using a syringe
feed pump under the H2 flow rate of 30 mL/min. Finally,
the liquid products were collected at the bottom of the reactor with
an ice-cooled trap in regular time intervals. These liquid products
were analyzed by a GC (Nucon 5785) equipped with a PEG-20 M capillary
column and a flame ionization detector. The products were identified
using a GC–mass spectrometer, equipped with QP5050A (Shimadzu
Instruments, Japan). The conversion of LA and the selectivity of GVL
were estimated according to the following equations    where nLAt=0 and nLAt represent initial and
final concentrations of the
reactant, respectively.
