Direct
one-pot hydrogenation of furfural (FFR) to cyclopentanone
(CPO) was investigated over different silica-supported Pd catalysts.
Among these, 4% Pd on fumed silica (4%Pd/f-SiO2) showed
remarkable results, achieving almost 98% furfural (FFR) conversion
with ∼89% selectivity and 87% yield to cyclopentanone at 165
°C and 500 psig H2 pressure. More interestingly, the
fumed-silica-supported catalyst tuned the selectivity toward the rearrangement
product, i.e., cyclopentanone, whereas all of the other supports were
found to give ring hydrogenation as well as side chain hydrogenation
products due to their parent Brönsted acidity and specific
support properties. X-ray diffraction data revealed the presence of
different phases of the face-centered cubic lattice of metallic Pd
along with lowest crystallite size of 15.6 nm in the case of the silica-supported
Pd catalyst. However, Pd particle size was found to be in the range
of 5–13 nm with even dispersion over the silica support, confirmed
by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis. While
studying the effect of reaction parameters, it was observed that lower
temperature gave low furfural conversion of 58% with only 51% CPO
selectivity. Similarly, higher H2 pressure lowered CPO
selectivity with subsequent increase in 2-methyl furan and ring hydrogenation
product 2-methyl furan and 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran. Thus, as per
the requirement, the product selectivity can be tuned by varying the
type of support and/or the reaction parameters suitably. With the
help of several control experiments and the characterization data,
a plausible reaction pathway was proposed for the selective formation
of cyclopentanone.

Introduction
Ever increasing depletion
of fossil resources augmented the research
of renewable alternatives, and eventually much of the focus is on
biomass valorization as a potential feedstock to meet the growing
demand of fuel and chemicals.1−3 Implementing new concepts of catalysis
for the selective and efficient defunctionalization of biomass-derived
molecules combined with scale-up strategies becomes the prime agenda
for viable solutions in near future.4,5 Furfural (FFR)
as a platform molecule is commercially produced via acid-catalyzed
dehydration of the lignocellulosic part of biomass primarily from
arabinose and xylose.5 Because of its oxygen-rich
content and the presence of a pendent carbonyl functionality, furfural
hydrogenation leads to a spectrum of products such as furfuryl alcohol
(FAL),6 tetrahydrofuran (THF),7 tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFAL),8 2-methyl furan (2-MF),9a 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF),10 pentane diols (PeDO),11,12,9b cyclopentanone (CPO),13 etc. (Scheme 1). Because of the
multiproduct formation in furfural hydrogenation, one of the key challenges
is to achieve the highest selectivity to the desired product. The
multifunctionality of furfural offers specific adsorption of C=O
and/or C=C bonds on the catalyst surface depending on the type
of catalyst/support under optimized reaction conditions, which results
in different selectivities for products.2,4,5 An efficient transformation of furfural at an affordable
cost and under ambient conditions is the driving force to develop
new catalyst systems and novel conversion routes.2,5

Scheme 1 General Scheme for Furfural Hydrogenation
Cyclopentanone is one of the fine chemicals used in pharmaceuticals,
insecticides, and rubber chemicals.14,15 The product
mixture of cyclopentanone and cyclopentanol (CPO and CPL) is used
in the fragrance and perfume industry as these are the major ingredients
of jasmine family.15 CPO is also used as
a solvent in various electronic industries as an antiresin reagent
because of its good resin solubilizing capacity. On the other hand,
unique physical properties of CPO such as high hydrophobic characteristic,
low latent heat, and reluctance to peroxide formations make it an
important starting material for Grignard reactions and the formation
of various derivatives as well as in coupling reactions, etc.14 It has a strong potential to be used in polyamide
preparations along with the preparation of C15–17 jet fuels
and as a stabilizer for polyolefins.16

The conventional synthesis of CPO involves catalytic vapor-phase
cyclization of 1,6-hexanediols or esters of adipic acid. It is also
prepared by liquid-phase catalytic oxidation of cyclopentene using
nitric acid. In both the routes, substrates are mainly of petroleum
origin.17−19 As furfural is easily available from several types
of agro wastes, cyclopentanone synthesis has been attempted starting
from furfural. Hronec et al. have extensively explored the conversion
of furfural and different furfural derivatives into CPO using various
noble as well as non-noble metal catalyst systems.20−22 Among several
catalysts studied, the highest yield of 82% of CPO and CPL together
was achieved over the 5% Pt/C catalyst but at a very high pressure
of H2 (8 MPa).21 Later, the
same research group has developed a bimetallic Pd–Cu catalyst
system, achieving complete FFR conversion and high CPO yield of 92%
within a short period of time (1 h) but using very high metal loading.22 Some other supported catalysts reported include
Ni–Cu/SBA giving 62% yield of CPO at 4 MPa H2 pressure,
whereas a mixture of Ru/C and Amberlyst-15 in biphasic systems gave
only 16% CPO selectivity.23,24 However, Ru supported
on carbon nanotube (CNT) and MIL-101 catalysts showed almost 90% yield
of CPO.25,26 Copper alone and in combination with other
metals were also reported for direct hydrogenation of furfural to
cyclopentanone. For example, the Cu–Co catalyst system was
found to give ∼67% selectivity to each CPO and CPL by varying
Cu loadings and catalyst preparation methods at 160 °C and 4
MPa H2 pressure.16 Various hydrotalcite-based
Cu–Ni–Al, Cu–Zn–Al, and Cu–Mg–Al
also showed selective formation of either CPO or CPL in the range
of 40–75%.27−29 Recently, Jiang et al. reported a 20% Cu/CNT catalyst
giving >65% CPO yield at 140 °C and at 4 MPa H2 pressure,
however requiring a longer reaction time of 12 h.30

Thus, developing a suitable catalyst for selective
ring opening
and closer via rearrangement followed by hydrogenation of furfural
at milder conditions still remains a challenge. In this article, we
report for the first time Pd on a fumed SiO2 (Pd/f-silica)
as a catalyst system for one-pot aqueous-phase hydrogenation of furfural,
giving excellent performance in terms of 98% conversion of furfural
and almost ∼89% selectivity to cyclopentanone at considerably
milder reaction conditions (165 °C and 500 psi H2 pressure).
The catalyst was thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), NH3-temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area, etc. Along with this, reaction conditions such as pressure,
temperature, and catalyst loading were also optimized to achieve maximum
selectivity to CPO. A plausible reaction pathway for furfural hydrogenation
to cyclopentanone is also proposed involving structure–activity
correlation with the help of different control experiments.

Results
and Discussion
In continuation of our previous studies on
the role of supports
in furfural hydrogenation for product selectivity tuning,8,11,35,36 here, we could successfully achieve the highest selectivity to CPO
using fumed silica as a support for the Pd catalyst.

Catalyst Characterization
Low-angle XRD of 4% Pd/SBA-15
and 4% Pd/hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) catalysts in Figure 1a shows a peak at
2θ = 0.96°, whereas that of 4% Pd/MCM-41 and 4% Pd/MCM-22
shows a peak at 2θ = 2.27°, confirming the presence of
the parent ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure.

different Pd-supported silica catalysts.
(b) XRD graphs of different Pd-supported silica catalysts.

XRD patterns of different silica-supported Pd catalysts
reduced
by NaBH4 are shown in Figure 1b. The appearance of the characteristic broad
peak at 2θ = 22.81° corresponding to the (002) plane of
silica confirmed its mesoporous nature, which was retained even after
impregnation of Pd. The characteristic peaks of Pd were observed at
2θ = 40.05, 46.56, and 68.22° corresponding to the (111),
(200), and (220) planes, clearly confirming the face-centered cubic
lattice of metallic Pd.37 Interestingly,
Pd(111) peaks observed in MCM-22, MCM-41, and HMS with an intensity
lower than that for f-SiO2 and SBA-15 supports suggest
the high degree of dispersion of Pd over the support. This ultimately
resulted in a more amorphous nature of the catalysts. A similar observation
was reported in the literature for Ni-based catalysts.38 The average crystallite size of Pd nanoparticles
(NPs) estimated from the full width at half-maximum of the (111) diffraction
peak by applying the Scherrer equation was about 15.6 nm in the case
of the Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst, which was much smaller than
that of all of the other catalysts prepared with various other supports
(Table 1), which might
be one of the reasons for its better performance. Furthermore, the
crystallite sizes of all of the catalysts were found to be in the
order of MCM-22 > SBA-15 > HMS > MCM-41 > f-SiO2, which
is linearly proportional to the rise in CPO selectivity, discussed
later.

BET surface areas of different silica-supported Pd
catalysts are
given in Table 1. Both
f-SiO2 and SBA-15 showed a comparatively low surface area
of 139 and 147 m2/g, respectively. In the case of the 4%
Pd/HMS catalyst, a comparatively high surface area (287 m2/g) was observed, whereas Pd/MCM-22 and Pd/MCM-41 showed moderate
surface areas of 197 and 254 m2/g, respectively. The remarkable
observation was that although the surface areas of all of the other
structured silica-supported Pd catalysts were much higher than that
of the fumed-silica-supported Pd catalyst, their activity trend was
reverse. Thus, the catalytic activity was governed not only by the
surface area but also by other physicochemical properties such as
reduced metal species, distribution and strength of acid sites, crystallite
size, and morphology.

To evaluate particle sizes and actual
distribution of metal particles
over the support, the TEM image of the best catalyst, i.e., 4% Pd/f-SiO2, was observed (Figure 2A). Uniform distribution of Pd NPs was observed, and the size
of particles was found to be in the range of 5–13 nm, whereas
the morphology of Pd nanoparticles was found to be spherical. The
chemical composition and elemental mapping of the 4% Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst analyzed by TEM and high-angle annular dark field
(HAADF)-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping are shown in Figure 2B. Figure 2B (i) was considered as a reference
image based on which elemental mapping was done. Figure 2B (ii,iii) showed that Si and
O were homogeneously distributed all over the surface with very few
dim areas, which might be due to the presence of impregnated Pd particles. Figure 2B (iv) showed that
there was uniform distribution of Pd, with some irregular dim areas
all over the sample, which indicates the presence of Si and O. Hence,
TEM results (Figure 2) revealed that Pd NPs were well distributed over the support without
any aggregation, which strongly contributes to its highest activity.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis of the 4% Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst was done to
study its chemical composition and electronic
states (Figure 3).
Deconvolution of the 3d spectrum of palladium showed two spin-orbital
states, i.e., 3d3/2 and 3d5/2, due to its spin–orbit
coupling and was further subdivided into four peaks mainly at binding
energies (BEs) of 334.64, 336.64, 339.73, and 342.27 eV. Of them,
two peaks observed at 334.64 and 339.73 eV corresponded to the metallic
state of Pd with spin-orbital splitting of 5.09 eV, which is in good
agreement with the literature report.39 However, peaks at BEs of 336.64 and 342.27 eV arising due to photoemission
of electrons from Pd2+ cations clearly revealed the presence
of PdO. It can be observed from XPS data that all of the peaks were
shifted to slightly lower binding energies, suggesting the strong
interaction between the silica support and palladium. The observed
lower shift also suggests the change in charge transfer or relaxation
energy from palladium to the silica support.40,41 Interestingly, no positive shift for Pd5/2 was observed,
which clearly suggests that there was no any formation of the Pd–Si
alloy over the Pd–Si interface.40,42 After deconvoluting
oxygen O 1s spectra (Figure S1), three
peaks were observed with binding energies of 529.53, 530.74, and 531.21
eV. Of these, peaks at BEs of 529.53 and 530.74 eV corresponded to
the presence of lattice oxygen and the peak at BE of 531.21 eV suggests
the presence of different oxygen defects or is due to the presence
of O2–, O– species, which ultimately
confirmed the presence of PdO species.43 Similarly, Si 1s spectra of Pd/SiO2 were also deconvoluted
as shown in Figure S2.

Figure 3 XPS spectra of Pd/f-SiO2: palladium
(Pd 3d).

The deconvolution of the Pd 3d
spectrum (3d3/2 and 3d5/2) of HMS-, SBA-, and
MCM-22-supported catalysts confirmed
the presence of Pd0 and PdO species, as shown in Figure S3. In the case of 4% Pd/HMS, peaks at
BEs of 334.39 and 339.86 eV corresponded to Pd0 and peaks
at BEs of 336.73 and 342.13 eV corresponded to PdO. At the same time,
for the 4% SBA-15 sample, peaks at BEs of 335.28 and 340.83 eV were
attributed to metallic Pd, whereas the single peak at BE of 343.18
eV was attributed to Pd oxide. The MCM-22-supported Pd sample showed
peaks at BEs of 335.06 and 339.93 eV corresponding to the metallic
Pd, whereas its oxides were completely absent. Interestingly, it showed
one distinct satellite peak at BE of 333.36 eV, which might be due
to uneven shaking of Pd electrons. To distinguish between the Pd2+ and Pd0 states being formed during activation
protocols, the relative intensity ratios of the Pd species from XPS
spectra were calculated and are presented in Table S1. It was observed that the Pd2+/Pd0 ratio decreased in the order of Pd/f-SiO2 < Pd/SBA-15
< Pd/MCM-22 < Pd/MCM-22, which directly reflected in their activity
performance, particularly, on CPO selectivity, as discussed later,
because Lewis acidic sites of PdO play an important role in the rearrangement
to yield CPO.

Acidity of the catalyst plays a very crucial role
in selective
formation of cyclopentanone from furfural. Most of the oxygen-containing
groups in silica possess acidity, which could be determined by NH3-TPD analysis, and the results are shown in Figure 4a,b. All of the catalysts showed
large desorption peaks appearing below 150 °C because of the
presence of weak acidic sites, indicating weak physisorption of the
NH3 molecule. Similarly, all of the catalysts showed a
combined broad NH3 desorption peak in the range of 200–700
°C, suggesting the mixture of moderate as well as strong acidic
sites. Total acidities of all Pd-supported catalysts were calculated
in terms of mmol/g NH3 desorbed and are given in Table 1.

Py-IR spectra of Pd-supported silica catalysts.

To confirm the presence of Lewis and Brönsted acidity
of
all silica supports, pyridine-IR experiments were performed, and the
results are given in Figure 4c. Absorption bands at around 1539–1541 cm–1 in all of the catalysts with different intensities represent Brönsted
acidity. In Py-IR spectra of 4% Pd/SiO2 (separately given
in Figure 4c), absorption
bands at 1575 and 1627 cm–1 represent the presence
of Lewis acidity, whereas small peaks at 1539 cm–1 confirm the presence of Brönsted acidity.44 The presence of both Lewis and Brönsted acidity
plays a key role in rearrangement and dehydration to form cyclopentanone,
as discussed later in the reaction mechanism.

Activity Testing
Selective conversion of furfural to
cyclopentanone mainly requires a metal function for hydrogenation,
Lewis acidity, water as medium, and external H2, and it
goes via Piancatelli-type rearrangement.20−22,45 Therefore, initially, Pd catalysts on different acidic
supports were prepared and screened for aqueous-phase hydrogenation
of furfural, and the results are given in Table 2. It was observed that the zirconia-supported
catalyst showed almost complete conversion with 40% selectivity toward
CPO and 42% selectivity to FAL (Table 2, entry 1). However, the fumed-silica-supported catalyst
achieved remarkable selectivity toward CPO (89%) with 98% FFR conversion,
suppressing the formation of other byproducts (Table 2, entry 2). Furthermore, TiO2-
and Al2O3-supported catalysts gave 85 and 76%
FFR conversion along with CPO selectivity of 25 and 34%, respectively,
with the formation of FAL as a major product (Table 2, entries 3 and 4). On the other hand, the
MMT-KP-30-supported catalyst showed 56% selectivity to THFAL with
90% FFR conversion (Table 2, entry 5). For all of the acidic supports, selectivity to
2-MF and 2-MeTHF was negligible. Because fumed silica gave the highest
performance in terms of the furfural rearrangement product (CPO),
further work on the effect of solvent was studied over the 4% Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst. Very surprisingly, in the 2-propanol solvent, the
Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst showed almost complete furfural conversion,
but maximum selectivity obtained was toward FAL (65%) and THFAL (25%)
with no selectivity to CPO and CPL (Table 2, entry 6). When methanol was used as a solvent,
multiproduct selectivities were observed with 90% conversion and only
18% selectivity to CPO (Table 2, entry 7). Hence, further study was carried out in water
as a solvent.

Effect of Type
of Silica
As the fumed silica support
showed CPO selectivity as high as 89%, various other types of silica
supports such as MCM-41, MCM-22, SBA-15, and HMS were also screened
for the 4% Pd catalyst. However, all of these catalysts showed CPO
selectivity lower than that obtained for fumed silica (Table 3). For example, with the HMS
support, 95% furfural conversion with 48% CPO selectivity was achieved
(Table 3, entry 2),
whereas for SBA-15 and MCM-22 supports, comparable selectivities of
30 and 26% to CPO, respectively, were obtained (Table 3, entries 3 and 4). Interestingly, Pd/MCM-41
showed 52% CPO selectivity with marginally lower FFR conversion of
90% (Table 3, entry
5). In general, all of these structured silica-supported catalysts
showed significant formation of THFAL in the range of 20–30%
and almost equal formation of THF and CPL, the products which were
completely suppressed in the case of fumed silica support. It is also
interesting to note the significant formation of FAL for MCM-22, as
against the fumed silica support (∼1%), and FAL selectivity
obtained for different structured silica supports was in the order
of MCM-22 > SBA-15 > HMS > MCM-41. This can be explained
on the basis
of specific adsorption of C=C bonds over different Pd catalysts.
At the same time, all of the catalysts showed very poor selectivities
to 2-MF as well as to 2-MeTHF. The lower selectivity to CPO was due
to the formation of resinous products under strongly acidic conditions.
Turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values of the respective
catalysts were calculated, and it was observed that 4% Pd/f-SiO2 and 4% Pd/SBA-15 catalysts showed highest TON and TOF values
as compared with all other silica-supported catalysts (Tables 1 and S2). At the same time, the effect of crystallite size wrt CPO selectivity
can be discussed irrespective of its FFR conversion (Figure 5). As mentioned above, CPO
selectivity decreased as the Pd crystallite size increased. For the
lowest crystallite size of 15.6 nm, ∼89% CPO selectivity was
observed. With the increase in crystallite size from 15.6 to 18.3
nm, CPO selectivity significantly decreased from 89 to 26%, whereas
a subsequent increase in FAL selectivity from 1 to 42% was observed.
Thus, selective rearrangement of furfural was preferred over the f-SiO2-supported catalyst only with a smaller crystallite size (15.6
nm) and was limited for other structured silica supports with somewhat
larger crystallite sizes. At the same time, manipulation of product
selectivities to the rearrangement product (CPO) and the side chain
hydrogenation product (FAL) could be achieved as a function of respective
silica supports with varying crystallite sizes. Thus, the fumed-silica
(f-SiO2)-supported catalyst was the best catalyst for one-pot
furfural hydrogenation to CPO.

Because 4% Pd/f-SiO2 showed
considerably high activity
in terms of furfural conversion and CPO selectivity, the Pd loading
effect was also studied in the range of 1–5%, and the results
are given in Figure 6. For a lower Pd loading of 1%, FFR conversion achieved was 85% with
the maximum selectivity to FAL giving only 35% CPO selectivity and
5% THFAL selectivity. As Pd loading was increased to 2%, conversion
reached up to 95% with a drastic increase in CPO selectivity from
35 to 64% at the cost of FAL selectivity from 55 to 26%. The increase
in Pd loading to 5% affected the CPO selectivity adversely, reducing
it from 89 to 65% with an increase in THFAL selectivity from 8 to
20% and also forming the over-hydrogenation product of CPO, i.e.,
CPL with 4% selectivity. In addition, a higher metal loading resulted
in ring hydrogenation to give ∼5% THF. Therefore, 4% was the
optimum Pd loading on the fumed silica support for selective synthesis
of CPO (89%).

reaction time, 5 h {others: 2-MF, 2-MeTHF, THF, PeDO’s, furans,
CPL, etc.}.

Furfural conversion and
CPO selectivity were also studied as a
function of reaction time, and these profiles are shown in Figure 7. Initially, at the
first hour of reaction time, almost half of the substrate was consumed
with rapid formation of furfuryl alcohol (69%) along with 29% CPO.
As reaction progresses to fifth hour, conversion reached to 98% along
with ∼90% selectivity to CPO with the formation of THFAL in
a very marginal amount (8%), formed via hydrogenation of the C=C
bond of FAL, which was formed at the initial time of reaction. Furthermore,
when the reaction progresses to extended hours (10 h), no substantial
change in both FFR conversion and CPO selectivity was observed (Table S3, entry 2). For all of the reactions,
almost ∼83% mass balance was observed as the balance was for resinous products of furfural.

Some control experiments
were also carried out in which various
products of FFR hydrogenation were used as starting materials (Table S3). For the first-step FFR hydrogenation
product, FAL as a starting material, CPO selectivity obtained was
78%, whereas (Table S3, entry 3) THFAL
did not show any conversion because of its extremely stable nature
(Table S3, entry 4). When CPO was also
used as the starting material (Table S3, entry 5), selective hydrogenation to CPL was observed with complete
CPO conversion. Interestingly, there was hardly any formation of the
polymerized product along with negligible selectivity to pentanediol
over silica catalysts. In all of the experiments, the formation of
intermediate 3-hydroxy-4-cyclopentenone was not identified over GC
and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The
main reason behind this could be its extreme instability at relatively
high reaction conditions and which may be readily undergoing reductive
rearrangement to form cyclopentanone. The formation of CPO was also
evidenced by GC–MS analysis (Figure S4). On the basis of the structure–activity correlation and
different control experiments (Table S3), we have elucidated the plausible reaction pathway for selective
formation of CPO (Scheme 2), which involves (i) initial hydrogenation of furfural to
form furfuryl alcohol over metallic Pd sites (Table S3, entry 6), (ii) subsequent attack of the water molecule
over the fifth position of the furan ring to form the oxycation, (iii)
under acidic conditions, rearrangement of the formed oxycation to
4-hydroxy-cyclopentenone via Piancatelli rearrangement with ring opening
and closing and with the loss of one mole of water, (iv) further dehydration
of 4-hydroxy-cyclopentenone, catalyzed by Brönsted acidity,
giving rise to a very unstable cyclopentadienone intermediate or cyclopentanone
intermediate, and (v) further hydrogenation of cyclopentadienone under
reductive conditions giving cyclopentanone.

Scheme 2 Plausible Reaction
Pathway over the Pd/f-SiO2 Catalyst
Because the 4% Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst
showed maximum selectivity
to cyclopentanone, further reaction parameter optimization was studied
for the same.

Reaction Parameter Optimization
Figure 8 shows the
effect of temperature on furfural
conversion and CPO selectivity. Obviously, furfural conversion increased
from 58 to 99% with an increase in the temperature from 135 to 200
°C. At a lower temperature of 135 °C, 51% selectivity to
CPO was observed, which increased to 89% as the temperature increased
to 165 °C. However, a further rise in temperature to 200 °C
affected the CPO selectivity adversely, which decreased to 76%. At
a lower temperature of 135 °C, 30% selectivity to FAL was observed,
which became nil with a rise in temperature to 200 °C. At the
same time, selectivities to THFAL, 2-MF, and 2-MeTHF remained somewhat
constant at all temperatures. Interestingly, 4 and 8% selectivities
were observed for the product of over-hydrogenation of CPO, i.e.,
CPL, at high temperatures of 180 and 200 °C, respectively. A
proportional decrease in FAL selectivity resulted in an increase in
CPO selectivity to 89% at 165 °C, whereas 76 and 8% for CPO and
CPL, respectively, at a higher temperature of 200 °C (Table S3, entry 7).

Figure 8 Effect of temperature
on the conversion and selectivity of furfural
hydrogenation. Reaction conditions: substrate, 5 g; solvent (H2O), 95 mL; catalyst, 4% Pd/f-SiO2; loading, 0.5
g; H2 pressure, 500 psig; agitation speed, 1000; reaction
time, 5 h {others: 2-MF, 2-MeTHF, THF, PeDO’s, furans, CPL,
etc.}.

Figure 9 shows the
effect of H2 pressure on FFR conversion and selectivity
to CPO. Furfural conversion increased from 78 to 99% as the H2 pressure increased from 100 to 700 psig. At a lower pressure
of 100 psig, 39% selectivity was observed for FAL along with 57% selectivity
for CPO. With a further increase in pressure to 350 psig, a drastic
rise in CPO selectivity from 57 to 80% was observed, which further
reached 89% at 500 psig. Similarly, at 350 psig, FAL selectivity decreased
from 39 to 15%, which again became almost nil with a further increase
in H2 pressure to 500 psig. For the highest pressure of
700 psig, CPO selectivity dropped down slightly to 75% and a subsequent
increase in over-hydrogenation products, i.e., CPL (5%) and THF (3%),
were observed. Significant formation of other byproducts, mainly polymerized
products, was observed at a higher H2 pressure (Table S3, entry 8).

Figure 9 Effect of H2 pressure on the conversion and selectivity
of furfural hydrogenation. Reaction conditions: substrate, 5 g; solvent

0.5 g; temperature, 165 °C; agitation speed, 1000; reaction time,
5 h {others: 2-MF, 2-MeTHF, THF, PeDO’s, furans, CPL, etc.}.

The effect of catalyst loading
was also studied in the range of
0.25–0.7 g, and results are given in Figure 10. Furfural conversion was found to increase
from 70 to 99% with an increase in catalyst loading from 0.25 to 0.7
g. At a lower catalyst loading of 0.25 g, the maximum selectivity
was observed for FAL (60%) along with CPO selectivity of 25% with
a considerable amount of byproduct formation (10%). On further increasing
the catalyst loading to 0.35 g, CPO selectivity increased to 61% with
a decrease in FAL selectivity from 60 to 25%. A further increase in
catalyst loading (0.7 g) affected the CPO selectivity adversely, which
dropped down to 70% along with an increase in THFAL selectivity up
to 15%. Therefore, 0.5 g was considered as the optimum catalyst loading
for furfural hydrogenation to cyclopentanone. The effect of substrate
loading was also studied in the range of 5–10 g, where CPO
selectivity decreased to 61% as well as furfural conversion decreased
to 51%, as shown in Figure S5.

catalyst loading on the conversion and selectivity of
furfural hydrogenation. Reaction conditions: substrate, 5 g; solvent

reaction time, 5 h {others: 2-MF, 2-MeTHF, THF, PeDO’s, furans,
CPL, etc.}.

The stability and recyclability
of the 4% Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst
was confirmed by carrying out the recycle runs under optimized reaction
conditions, and the results are shown in Figure 11. After completion of the first run with
the fresh catalyst, the later was allowed to settle down, the reaction
crude was separated by decantation, and a new charge was fed for continuing
the reaction. Till the second recycle, the catalyst was quite stable
and gave almost similar results as the fresh one. For the third recycle,
furfural conversion dropped down to 91% along with a decrease in CPO
selectivity to 82% with a subsequent increase in FAL selectivity to
11%. The decrease in furfural conversion and CPO selectivity could
be due to oligomer formation during the reaction, which might result
into deactivation of the catalyst surface or decrease in metallic
active sites of Pd. Interestingly, the spent catalyst regained its
activity after activating it in the presence of H2. Subsequently,
the stability of the Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst was also confirmed
by performing the hot filtration test, and the results are shown in Figure S6. In a typical experiment, the reaction
was stopped after completion of the first hour. The catalyst was separated
out, and the reaction was continued till fifth hour. There was hardly
any change in furfural conversion as well as CPO selectivity with
no any leaching of active metal during the reaction, confirmed by
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)
analysis. Later, the actual presence of Pd over the catalysts after
subsequent recycle runs was confirmed by EDX analysis (Figure S7).

THF, PeDO’s, furans, CPL, etc.}.

To study the effect of successive catalyst recycles on the
catalyst
composition, XPS analysis of the 4% Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst
was done (Figure 12). In the used catalyst, two peaks appeared at BEs of 334.87 and
340.69 eV corresponding to metallic Pd, whereas one small peak at
336.41 eV represented the presence of palladium oxide. No significant
change in peak positions was observed, but the increase in metallic
content and decrease in its oxide during successive catalyst recycling
was observed (Table S1) because of in situ
reduction under the reaction conditions. After deconvolution of O
1s spectra of the Pd/f-SiO2 catalyst (Figure S8), peaks at 529.94 and 530.90 eV corresponded to
the lattice oxygen and surface hydroxyl groups. Interestingly, the
peak at BE of 532.46 eV represented the adsorbed C=O bond of
adsorbed furfural and cyclopentanone during successive catalyst recycles.9

Conclusions
In
the present study, palladium catalysts supported
on different silica frameworks were prepared by the standard wet impregnation
method keeping 4% metal loading constant and were screened for furfural
hydrogenation to achieve the highest selectivity to cyclopentanone.
Among all of the Pd-supported catalysts, 4% Pd/f-SiO2 exhibited
almost complete furfural conversion with 89% selectivity and with
∼87% yield to CPO. Specific Lewis acidity of the silica (SiO2) support was found to play a crucial role in selective formation
of CPO. However, all of the other silica supports tend to give a mixture
of products, which may be due to the presence of strong Brönsted
acid sites. Even distribution of Pd particles with spherical morphology
and with particle size in the range of 5–13 nm was confirmed
by HR-TEM. The role of Lewis acidity and water-mediated reaction pathway
for furfural to CPO was elucidated by controlled experiments and by
XPS and Py-IR characterization of the catalyst. More interestingly,
the product selectivity was tuned by varying the different reaction
parameters such as temperature, pressure, catalyst loading, etc. The
catalyst was also found to be very much stable and can be recycled
three times with a marginal change in selectivity. Leaching of catalyst
was also cross-checked by the hot filtration test and the ICP-OES
technique. Results of some control experiments and structural characterization
allowed us to elucidate a reaction pathway for the selective formation
of CPO. Hydrogenation of furfural proceeded to give first-step hydrogenation
product, furfuryl alcohol, over metallic Pd, followed by the attack
of water molecule on the furan ring to form the FAL oxycation. The
later rearranges to give 4-hydroxy-cyclopentenone via Piancatelli
rearrangement with the loss of one mole of water and its dehydration, followed by hydrogenation, which
gives cyclopentanone.

Experimental Section
Materials
Furfural,
furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl
alcohols, 2-methylfuran, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, pentanediols, tetraethyl
orthosilicate, cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide, DDS, palladium nitrate,
and fumed silica were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Bangalore, India.
Sodium hydroxide, isopropyl alcohol, and sodium borohydride were purchased
from Thomas Baker, India. Hydrogen gas (>99.9% purity) was obtained
from Vadilal Chemicals Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India.

Preparation
of Supports
All catalyst supports, i.e.,
HMS, MCM-41, SBA-15, and MCM-22, were prepared by the previously reported
procedures.31−34 Fumed silica was used as it is without any chemical treatment.

Catalyst Preparation
All of the catalysts were prepared
according to the previously reported procedure.35 In a typical procedure, for 1 g of catalyst, 85 mg of anhydrous
Pd(NO3)2 was first dissolved in 50 mL of deionized
(DI) water. To this, a slurry of 0.96 g of fumed silica in water was
added slowly with constant stirring, and the whole mixture was stirred
for 1 h. NaOH solution (2 M) was then added (∼5 mL) to the
above solution till the pH became almost neutral, and the stirring
was continued further for 30 min. To the above solution, 0.5 g of
NaBH4 was added in small portions, and stirring was continued
for next 30 min. The resultant solid catalyst was filtered, washed
with DI water, and dried in an oven at 100 °C. A similar procedure
was adopted for the preparation of catalysts with different Pd loadings
in the range of 1–5% as well as for Pd on different silica
supports.

Catalyst Characterization
X-ray diffraction measurements
were carried out on Shimadzu Labx-6100 series instrument using Cu
Kα crystallinity. The presence of Pd loading was confirmed by
EDX analysis on a LEO-LEICA STEREOSCAN 440 instrument. HR-TEM and
HAADF-STEM images of the catalyst were obtained using a transmission
electron microscope, model JEOL 1200 EX. For this purpose, a small
amount of the solid sample was sonicated in 2-propanol for 10 min.
A drop of the prepared suspension was deposited on a Cu grid coated
with a carbon layer, and the grid was then dried at room temperature
before analysis. BET surface areas of all of the catalysts were measured
using a Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720 instrument. Temperature-programmed
desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was also performed on a
Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720 instrument. In a typical experiment,
0.05 g of catalyst was taken in a U-shaped, flow-through, quartz sample
tube. Prior to measurements, the catalyst was pretreated in He (25
cm3/min) at 200 °C for 2 h. The mixture of NH3 in He (30%) was passed (25 cm3/min) at 50 °C
for 1 h. TPD measurements were carried out in the range of 50–700
°C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Ammonia concentration
in the effluent was monitored with a gold-plated-filament thermal
conductivity detector. For determining the Pd content in the filtrate
of the leaching experiment, the supernatant liquid was evaporated
and the resulting product concentrate was treated with aqua-regia
(HNO3/HCl = 1:3) at 60 °C on a sand bath for 2 h and
then diluted up to 25 mL with distilled water. This sample was then
analyzed by an ICP-OES. Py-IR spectra of all of the prepared catalysts
were recorded on a Perkin Elmer 2000 FTIR spectrometer in the range
of 4000–400 cm–1 using the KBr pellet technique.
XPS analysis was carried out on Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments.
The spectra were excited by a low-power Al Kα X-ray source,
and the analyzer was operated in the constant analyzer energy mode.
For the individual peak energy regions, a pass energy of 20 eV set
across the hemispheres was used. The sample powders were analyzed
as pellets without exposing to air. The pressure in the analysis chamber
was on the order of 10–8 torr during data collection.
The constant charging of the samples was eliminated by referencing
all of the energies to the Si 2p set at 103.5 eV. Analyses of the
peaks were performed with the software provided by VG.9b

Typical Procedure for Catalytic
Hydrogenation of Furfural
Catalytic hydrogenation of furfural
was performed in a 300 mL stainless
steel autoclave (Parr reactor) equipped with an overhead stirrer,
a pressure gauge, and an automatic temperature control facility. In
a typical experiment, 5 g of furfural, 95 mL of water, and 0.5 g of
catalyst were charged into the reactor. It was then sealed and purged
with N2 two times to exclude air and then by H2 by a deep tube. After attaining the desired reaction temperature,
the reactor was pressurized with hydrogen to the desired value and
the reaction was started by stirring the contents at 1000 rpm. The
liquid samples were withdrawn from the reactor with every 1 h time
interval and subjected for GC analysis, for monitoring the progress
of the reaction. H2 consumption as a function of time was
also recorded, and the reaction was carried out at a constant pressure
by filling it with fresh H2 as per the consumption.

Product
Analysis
Samples collected from time to time
were analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2025) using a capillary
column of free fatty acid phase (30 m (length) × 0.53 mm (i.d.)
× 1 μm (film thickness)) connected to a flame ionization
detector. The identification of products was carried out by a comparison
of retention times of particular samples. The catalyst was recycled
and reused three times to check its activity and effect on the rate
of reaction. The performance of different Pd-supported silica catalysts
was studied in terms of (%) conversion of furfural and (%) product
selectivity as defined below
