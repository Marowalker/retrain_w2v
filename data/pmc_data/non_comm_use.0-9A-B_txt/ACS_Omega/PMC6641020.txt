Solar radiation mineralizes
dissolved organic matter (DOM) to dissolved inorganic carbon through
photochemical reactions (DIC photoproduction) that are influenced
by iron (Fe) and pH. This study addressed as to what extent Fe contributes
to the optical properties of the chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and DIC photoproduction
at different pH values. We created the associations of Fe and DOM
(Fe-DOM) that cover the range of loadings of Fe on DOM and pH values
found in freshwaters. The introduced Fe enhanced the light absorption
by CDOM independent of pH. Simulated solar irradiation decreased the
light absorption by CDOM (i.e., caused photobleaching). Fe raised
the rate of photobleaching and steepened the spectral slopes of CDOM
in low pH but resisted the slope steepening in neutral to alkaline
pH. The combination of a low pH (down to pH 4) and high Fe loading
on DOM (up to 3.5 μmol mg DOM–1) increased
the DIC photoproduction rate and the apparent quantum yields for DIC
photoproduction up to 7-fold compared to the corresponding experiments
at pH >6 or without Fe. The action spectrum for DIC photoproduction
shifted toward the visible spectrum range at low pH in the presence
of Fe. Our results demonstrated that Fe can contribute to DIC photoproduction
by up to 86% and produce DIC even at the visible spectrum range in
acidic waters. However, the stimulatory effect of Fe is negligible
at pH >7.

Introduction
Solar radiation photochemically
mineralizes 13–35 Tg C yr–1 of dissolved
organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved inorganic
carbon (DIC) in lakes and reservoirs.1 Iron
(Fe) increases the light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic
matter (CDOM), and therefore influences DIC photoproduction indirectly
through changes in the optical properties of CDOM. Solar radiation
can mineralize Fe(III)-polycarboxylate complexes of DOM to DIC (Figure S1).2 Irradiation
of Fe can generate reactive oxygen species that mineralize DOC (Figure S1).3 Low pH
enhances Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction (Figure S1, red circles).4−6 The recent increases in Fe concentration
([Fe]) and DOC as well as in pH7−14 emphasize the need to understand the impact of pH and [Fe] on the
optical properties of CDOM and DIC photoproduction in freshwaters.

In many surface waters with pH 4–9, ferric iron exists primarily
as complexes with DOM and as colloids of iron(oxy)hydroxide stabilized
by DOM.15−19 The colloids
stabilized by DOM resist gravitoidal settling, pass filters (e.g.,
0.45 μm), and are difficult to separate from Fe complexed by
DOM.15,19,20 In this study,
the Fe associated with DOM is abbreviated to Fe-DOM, which includes
both the Fe complexes of DOM and the iron(oxy)hydroxide colloids stabilized
by DOM.

The importance of Fe stimulus for DIC photoproduction
in natural
waters has been examined mostly with two approaches: (1) relating
DIC photoproduction to water quality parameters and (2) introducing
strong complexing ligands for Fe into natural water samples. The first
approach has shown that [Fe] and acidity correlate positively with
DIC photoproduction.21−23 According to the second approach, the complexing
ligands for Fe reduce DIC photoproduction rates (DICprs).4,5,23 Both approaches show that [Fe]
and acidity play important roles in DIC photoproduction. The quantitative
role of Fe on DIC photoproduction remains unclear because the photoreactivity
of DOM in natural waters can vary24 even
without Fe and the introduced complexing ligands may potentially interfere
with DIC photoproduction.

The DICpr depends on the intensity
of irradiation and optical properties
of natural waters. Fe(III) enhances light absorption of CDOM, particularly
at the longer wavelengths of the visible spectrum range.25,26 DIC photoproduction and the photoreduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II)
increase exponentially with shorter wavelengths of irradiance,4,27−29 indicating that Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction
has strong spectral dependence. Photon flux densities of solar radiation
increase from low values at the UV range to the maximum of the visible
spectrum range. The light absorption by CDOM and the photochemical
reactivity of DOM are all spectrally dependent due to solar radiation,
and spectral dependence should be accounted for the Fe-stimulated
DIC photoproduction.

This study quantified the impact of [Fe]
and pH on the optical
properties of CDOM, the light-induced changes in optical properties,
DICprs, and the spectral-apparent quantum yields for DIC photoproduction
(ϕλ). To generate the associations between
Fe(III) and DOM (Fe-DOM), the same concentration (10 mg DOM L–1) of Fe-free DOM isolate from lake water received
Fe(III) at different concentrations. Our experiments covered 20 combinations
of pH and [Fe], where the pH ranged from 4 to 9.4 and the Fe loadings
on DOM were from 0.004 to 3.5 μmol Fe mg DOM–1. Competing multiple regression models were used to find the most
parsimonious model that was able to explain the effect of pH and [Fe]
on the optical properties of CDOM and DIC photoproduction. On the
basis of the modeling, we estimated the magnitude of the Fe-stimulated
DIC photoproduction. Determination of ϕλ allowed
us to evaluate the spectral dependence of DIC photoproduction and
showed that Fe shifted the action spectrum of DIC photoproduction
towards the visible spectrum range.

Results
Dependence
of Optical Properties on pH and [Fe]
When
the same DOM concentration (10 mg DOM L–1) was associated
with the different Fe concentrations and adjusted to pH values ranging
from 4 to 9.4 (Table S2), the absorption
coefficient of CDOM at 330 nm (a330) increased
with the rising [Fe] (a330_Dark in Figure 1a; “Init.”
in Table S5). The dependence of a330 on [Fe] and pH (expressed as the concentration
of hydrogen ion, [H+] = 10–pH in the
models) was analyzed with eight competing regression models (Table S8). The a330_Dark was significantly dependent on [Fe] in all models that included
[Fe] as a separate predictor variable (shown as bold regression coefficients b1 for the models 2, 4, 6, and 8 in Table S8). In the model 7 without [Fe] as a separate predictor
variable, a330_Dark was significantly
dependent on pH (term [H+], coefficient b2) and the interaction between pH and [Fe] (term [Fe] [H+], coefficient b3; Table S8). Among the models containing only significant terms (models 1,
2, and 7 in Table S8), the model 2 had
the lowest value of AICc (110 in Table S8). Therefore, the model 2 (marked with * in Table S8) was selected to explain the simplest significant dependence
of a330_Dark on the predictor variables.
According to the best model 2 (Table S8), a330_Dark was significantly dependent
on [Fe] alone. The model 2 (Table S8) is
illustrated as a surface in Figure 1a together with color-coded dots that show a330_Dark in the 20 experiments (Table S5). In a similar manner, text in the later
results section refers to the significant dependencies of the most
parsimonious models marked with * in Tables S8–S18, which are also illustrated as surfaces in Figures 1–3.

Figure 1 Impact of [Fe]
and pH on the optical properties of CDOM represented
as (a) the absorption coefficient of CDOM at 330 nm (a330_Dark) and (b) the spectral slope ratio (SR_Dark) in the dark control samples. Dots show the experimental
data (Tables S5 and S6), and the surfaces
show the fit of the best model on the data (model 2 in both Tables S8 and S10). The color of dots and the
surfaces follows the value of the vertical axis. The lowest values
are shown in violet, intermediate values with cyan, blue, green, yellow,
and orange, and the highest values in red.

The Fe associated with DOM increased the absorption coefficient
of CDOM at different wavelengths unequally because the spectral slope
coefficients (S275–295, S350–400) decreased with increasing [Fe]
associated to DOM (Table S6). The value
of S275–295 decreased more than
that of S350–400, which was seen
as a decrease in the slope ratio (SR)
(Figure 1b, Table S6). The changes in S275–295 (model 2 in Table S9) and SR (model 2 in Table S10) depended only on [Fe], as illustrated for SR (Figure 1b). Therefore, the changes in optical properties of
CDOM depended only on the introduced [Fe] and not on pH adjustment
(Tables S9–S11, Figure 1).

Simulated solar irradiation
decreased a330 (i.e., caused photobleaching)
and increased S275–295 and SR values (Tables S5 and S6). The photobleaching of a330 (Δa330) and photochemistry-induced
change in S275–295 (ΔS275–295) and in SR (ΔSR) depended
positively on the interaction between [Fe] and acidity (Figure 2a,b; model 5 in Table S11, models 6 in Tables S12 and S13). ΔS275–295 and ΔSR were additionally negatively
dependent on [Fe] (Figure 2b; models 6 in Tables S12 and S13).

Figure 2 Impact of [Fe] and pH on (a) the photobleaching of a330 (Δa330), (b) the
photochemistry-induced change in SR (ΔSR), and (c) DICpr. Dots show experimental data
(Tables S5–S7) and the surfaces
show the fit of the best models on data (model 5 in Table S11, model 6 in Table S13 and model 5 in Table S14). Note that
the highest values in the surface exceed the experimental data and
should be treated with caution. Color-coding is the same as in Figure 1.

Rate of DIC Photoproduction at Different
pH and [Fe]
Irradiation produced DIC at rates ranging from
1.72 to 12.08 μmol
C L–1 h–1 (Table S7). Because each experiment contained an identical
concentration (10 mg DOM L–1) of the same solid-phase
extracted DOM (SPE-DOM), the up to 7-fold differences in the rate
of DIC photoproduction were caused by the experimental adjustments
of pH and [Fe]. According to the best model, DICpr was dependent on
the interaction between pH and [Fe] (Figure 2c; model 5 in Table S14).

Influence of Fe and pH on ϕλ
The calculations of ϕλ (details in Supporting Information) accounted for the light
absorption by the introduced Fe (Figure 1) and photobleaching of CDOM during the irradiations
(Figure 2). The ϕλ values are reported in Table S7 with two parameters: c, the apparent quantum yields
at wavelength 0 nm (=ϕ0) and d,
the spectral slope coefficient of ϕλ (eq 2). These two parameters
allow the calculation of ϕλ spectrally, as
shown in Figure S5 or at a specific wavelength
(e.g., 330 nm; ϕ330,Table S7), which approximates the median wavelength (λ50%) that induced DIC photoproduction during the irradiations.

Both ϕ330 and c were positively
dependent on the interaction between [Fe] and acidity (Figure 3a,b; models 5 in Tables S15 and S16) similar to that found for the rate of DIC photoproduction (Figure 2c; model 5 Table S14). The spectral slope coefficient of
ϕλ, d, had a similar but negative
dependence on the interaction between [Fe] and acidity (Figure 3c, model 5 in Table S17). The rise in c indicated a general
increase in ϕλ at any wavelength, but the decrease
in d meant that ϕλ increased
relatively more at longer wavelengths.

Figure 3 Impact of [Fe] and pH
on the apparent quantum yields spectra for
DIC photoproduction, ϕλ values (a) at 330 nm,
ϕ330; (b) c of eq 2; and (c) spectral slope coefficient of ϕλ (=d of eq 2). Dots indicate experimental data (Table S7), and the surfaces show the fit of the
best model on data (models 5 in Tables S14–S16). Please note that in (c) the orientation of the three-dimensional
cube is different.

To demonstrate the role
of [Fe] on DIC photoproduction at different
pH values, we calculated the relative contribution of Fe-stimulated
ϕ330 (ϕ330,Fe) to the total ϕ330 (ϕ330,total) for a few selected [Fe] (Figure 4). When [Fe] was
>10 μM, Fe-stimulated reactions dominated DIC photoproduction
at pH 4, but their contribution fell to a few percent at pH 6 and
was negligible at pH >7 (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Contribution of Fe to the apparent quantum yields for
DIC photoproduction
at 330 nm (ϕ330,Fe/ϕ330,total) at
the selected [Fe], along a pH gradient. The ratio ϕ330,Fe/ϕ330,total is calculated from model 5 in Table S15 (also shown as a surface in Figure 3a). According to
model 5, ϕ330,Fe = ϕ330,total –
3.76 × 10–4 (mol C mol photons–1), where the intercept refers to a pH-independent ϕ330 without Fe. The concentration of DOM was always 10 mg DOM L–1, therefore, e.g., 35 μM Fe refers to a loading
of 3.5 μmol Fe mg DOM–1.

Figure 5 compares
the largest ϕλ at pH 4 with 18 μM [Fe]
(experiment #11) to the ϕλ without the introduced
Fe at a similar pH (#1; Table S7). The
Fe-stimulated ϕλ is calculated as the difference
in ϕλs between experiment #11 and #1 (#11–#1, Figure 5, red dotted line).
The spectral slope coefficient for ϕλ was smaller
for the Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction (d = 0.020
nm–1, Figure 5, red dotted line) than for the corresponding experiment without
the introduced Fe (d = 0.025 nm–1 in #1, Figure 5,
blue dotted line).

Figure 5 ϕλs in acidic (pH ≈ 4) experiments
#1 (0.04 μM [Fe]) and #11 (18 μM [Fe]) as well as the
Fe-stimulated ϕλ calculated as a difference
in ϕλ values between #11 and #1. c and d are reported in Table S7 for #1 and #11. For the Fe-stimulated ϕλ (#11–#1), c = 0.934 mol C mol photons–1 and d = 0.0200 nm–1. The same ϕλs are shown in (a) linear and
(b) in logarithmic scales.

To illustrate the potential environmental impact of Fe on
DIC photoproduction
in acidic waters (pH ≈ 4), we calculated the action spectra
for DIC photoproduction per m2 using a typical daily solar
radiation spectrum and the ϕλ values reported
in Figure 5 (Figure 6). The rate of DIC
photoproduction calculated as an integral over 300–700 nm was
2456 μmol C m–2 day–1 in
the presence of 18 μM [Fe] and 5.8 times larger than 424 μmol
C m–2 day–1 in the presence of
negligible 0.04 μM [Fe] (Figure 6). Fe shifted the action spectrum toward the visible
spectrum range and caused Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction even at
wavelengths >500 nm (Figure 6). At wavelengths >500 nm, Fe stimulus is nearly entirely
responsible for DIC photoproduction (Figure 6). The median wavelength for DIC photoproduction
(λ50%) shifted by 20 nm from 378 (#1) to 398 nm (#11; Figure 6).

earth surface averaged across the latitudes (168 W m–2 global radiation), having the properties of ASTM G173-03 reference
solar spectrum.41 The arrows show the median
wavelength inducing areal DIC photoproduction (λ50%), which is 378 nm in #1 without Fe and 398 nm in #11 with 18 μM
Fe.

Discussion
This
study systematically examined the combined impact of pH and
introduced Fe(III) onto the optical properties of CDOM, the rates
of photoreactions (photobleaching, DIC photoproduction), and the spectral
photochemical reactivity (ϕλ) of a natural
Fe-free isolate of aquatic DOM. Our major findings (summarized in Table 1) imply that Fe can
have a strong effect on the optical properties and photochemistry
of DOM, but the effect is often regulated by pH.

Impact of Fe and pH on Optical Properties
As expected
for the DOM isolated from a humic lake, its low SR (≈0.7) is a characteristic of a terrestrial DOM
that has entered the aquatic regime recently.38 Our experimental Fe introduction demonstrated that the association
of Fe(III) with DOM decreases S275–295 more than S350–400 when independent
of pH and causes a decline in SR in agreement
with earlier studies.25,26 These observations suggest that
Fe(III) associated with DOM contributes to a high aλ and low SR that is
related to the fresh input of terrestrial CDOM into the aquatic regime.25,38

In this study, aλ increases
linearly along the concentration of Fe(III) associated with DOM, consistent
with the previous findings.25,26,42 The rise in aλ caused by Fe(III)
is pH-independent according to this (pH 4–9.4) and an earlier
study (pH 2–7).26 Some studies have
reported an increase in aλ with
pH,42−44 but for waters rich in Fe, this pH effect is smaller
than the contribution of Fe(III) to aλ (this study).26,42 For instance, 35 μM Fe
doubled aλ and contributed about
50% to the light absorption by Fe(III)-DOM (Table S5). Similar or even higher contributions of Fe to the light
absorption by CDOM have been reported in rivers33 or springs fed by groundwater.25

Irradiation decreases (i.e., photobleaches) aλ and increases SR according
to this and earlier studies.6,38 In our experiments,
these changes in the optical properties of CDOM took place both in
the presence and absence of Fe, although to a different degree, depending
on the combination of [Fe] and pH. In this study, Fe-stimulated photobleaching
increased SR and S275–295 at low pH but resisted these changes in the
spectral slopes at high pH (Figure 2a,b; Tables S12 and S13).
The stimulatory effect of [Fe] and acidity may be partly related to
photoproduced Fe(II), which absorbs light weakly and oxidizes slowly
to highly absorbing Fe(III) at low pH.26,45 Additionally,
the same combination (high Fe(III) and low pH) stimulates photoproduction
of HO•, which can attack organic chromophores and
enhance their photobleaching.46−48 At high pH, photoproduced Fe(II)
is oxidized rapidly back to highly absorbing Fe(III) and the photobleaching
of Fe-DOM likely primarily concerns the organic chromophores of CDOM.
The chromophores of Fe(III) in nonacidic waters seem to withstand
photobleaching similar to iron oxides that are commonly used as weather-resistant
outdoor pigments in neutral–alkaline conditions.49

Impact of Fe and pH on DIC Photoproduction
According
to our irradiation experiments, pH (4–9.4) alone has a nonsignificant
impact on DICpr when [Fe] is low (Table S7). Similarly, an earlier study showed that an experimental acidification
by one pH unit had a nonsignificant effect on DIC photoproduction
in lake waters (pH 4.2–7.2) with low [Fe].50 Our study showed that Fe stimulates DIC photoproduction
in acidic but not in neutral to alkaline conditions. In agreement
with our findings, DIC photoproduction was dependent on [Fe] in 38
Swedish lakes, including acidic lakes (pH 4.5–9.5) but the
dependence was absent in a subset of 27 lakes having pH >6 (Figure S6).21 Likewise,
in six lakes and two reservoirs (Québec, Canada), the broadband-apparent
quantum yields for DIC photoproduction showed a nonsignificant relationship
with ambient pH 6.4–8.2.51 Fe introduction
to circumneutral Brandy Lake inflow did not give rise to photochemical
loss of DOC.23 Thus, pH has a minor role
on DIC photoproduction in the absence of Fe (ref (50), this study) or in neutral
to alkaline waters even in the presence of Fe (refs (21, 23, 51), this study).

Our experiments showed that Fe stimulates DIC photoproduction only
in acidic conditions similar to those found earlier in natural water
samples.3−5,21,44,48,50,52 According to our volumetric DICprs (Figure 2c), ϕλs (Figures 3 and 4), or the areal rates calculated from ϕλs (Figure 6), the Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction is responsible for up to
86% of the total DIC photoproduction at pH ≈ 4 with up to 3.5
μmol Fe mg DOM–1. In the example illustrated
in Figure 6 (pH ≈
4, 1.8 μmol Fe mg DOM–1), Fe contributed 83%
to the total DIC photoproduction. The calculated contribution (Figure 5) would fall to 56%
at pH 4, with 1 μmol Fe mg DOM–1, which is
the highest reported amount of Fe complexed by DOM in natural waters.18 In typical boreal wetlands and forested streams
(pH 4–5; 0.3–0.4 μmol complexed Fe mg DOM–1),18 the calculated (Figure 5) contribution of
Fe to DIC photoproduction is between 4 and 33%. In a strict sense,
these calculations apply to our experimental conditions, but they
suggest that Fe can contribute up to ≈50% to DIC photoproduction
in acidic surface waters.

How Does Iron Stimulate DIC Photoproduction
at Low pH?
Our study was not designed to address the mechanistic
details of
Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction, but here, we discuss how our observations
fit to the mechanistic understanding gained by earlier studies.2,3 Fe can contribute to DIC photoproduction through two principal mechanisms:
(1) the photochemical decarboxylation of Fe(III)–carboxylate
complexes and (2) the photo-Fenton reactions (Figure S1). DOM can bind Fe(III) into Fe(III)–carboxylate
complexes ([1], Figure S1). In the first
mechanism, a light-induced ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer (LMCT;
[2], Figure S1) can decarboxylate the Fe(III)–carboxylate
complexes and produce DIC ([3], Figure S1). In the second mechanism, photoproduced ferrous iron (Fe(II)) can
reduce dioxygen (O2) to superoxide/hydroperoxyl radicals
(HO2•/O2–; [4], Figure S1). Dismutation of HO2•/O2– produces
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can oxidize
Fe(II) and generate hydroxyl radicals (HO•) through
photo-Fenton reactions ([5] and [9], Figure S1). HO• can oxidize DOM and produce DIC ([6], Figure S1). A single reaction between DOM and
HO• can release CO2 ([6], Figure S1), but approximately three moles HO• are typically needed to produce 1 mol CO2 from DOM.53

Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction
benefits from acidic conditions (refs (23, 50), this study), as indicated with red circles
in Figure S1: (i) acidity facilitates complexation
of Fe(III) with DOM instead of formation of insoluble Fe(III)(hydr)oxides;18 (ii) at low pH, O2– equilibrates to HO2•;54 (iii) acidity promotes the dismutation of HO2•/O2– to H2O2;54 and (iv) acidity promotes
the formation of HO• instead of a weaker oxidant
Fe(IV).55 Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction
through the photochemical decarboxylation of Fe(III)–carboxylate
complexes can be efficient (quantum yields up to 1 in Fe(III)-oxalate),2 but requires re-formation of Fe(III)–carboxylate
complexes that is favored by low pH. Photo-Fenton mechanisms do not
necessarily require physical association between DOM and Fe, because
numerous species of Fe(III),56 simple ions
([Fe(III) OH (H2O)5]2+),27 inorganic colloids or solids,57 or organic complexes46,58 can efficiently yield
Fe(II) and HO•. Our study cannot evaluate the relative
importance of the two principal mechanisms for Fe-stimulated DIC production,
but both of these mechanisms require photochemical reduction of Fe(III)
and benefit from low pH.

ϕλs and Spectral Dependence
of Fe-Stimulated
DIC Photoproduction
The ϕ330s determined
in this study have a similar range reported earlier for freshwater,
in which the magnitude of the reported ϕ330s depend
mostly on the optical properties of DOM but decrease with pH (Figure S7).1,24,28,37,59,60 The pH dependence of ϕ330s in freshwater (Figure S7) is possibly
related to their indigenous Fe because the magnitude of ϕ330 depends on the interaction of pH and Fe.

In this
study, the spectral slope coefficient of ϕλ for Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction was lower compared to that
of the corresponding slope without Fe stimulation (Figure 5). This indicates that the
contribution of Fe to DIC photoproduction changes with wavelength.
This phenomenon depends in part on the effect of Fe(III) on the optical
properties of CDOM (a reduction of spectral slope of CDOM, Table S6)25,26 but also suggests that
Fe is photochemically active at long wavelengths.

All mechanisms
for Fe-assisted DIC photoproduction (Figure S1) require the photochemical reduction
of Fe(III) to Fe(II). The photoreduction of Fe(III) is involved in
the HO• production from [Fe(III) OH (H2O)5]2+27 and in
the photochemical dissolution of lepidocrocite.29 The apparent quantum yields for these reactions decrease
exponentially with wavelength and have spectral slopes similar to
those of Fe-stimulated DIC photoproduction (Figure S8). This similarity suggests that the apparent quantum yields
for the photochemical reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) decreases exponentially
with wavelength and determines the spectral dependence of associated
reactions (e.g., the photoproduction of HO•,27 dissolved Fe(II),29 or DIC (this study)).

Our calculated action spectrum for Fe-stimulated
DIC photoproduction
at pH 4 was shifted toward the visible spectrum range compared to
that for DIC photoproduction without Fe (Figure 6). Although the UV and the short-wavelength
visible spectrum range dominate the calculated DIC photoproduction,
Fe is almost entirely responsible for DIC photoproduction at the wavelengths
>500 nm (Figure 6).
Irradiation at 590–630 or 577 nm can photoreduce Fe(III) in
lepidocrocite or in Fe(III)-phenolate (quantum yields approximately
10–4), respectively.29,61 These observations
indicate that the light absorption by Fe in the visible spectrum range
even at >500 nm can reduce Fe(III)-DOM to Fe(II) and stimulate
DIC
photoproduction in acidic waters.

Environmental Significance
During the past two to three
decades, the export of Fe from land to inland waters has increased
and enhanced the role of Fe in water color.10,12,14,62 Since the
1980s, a reduction in sulfate deposition has raised pH7,63 and mobilized soil-derived organic matter to aquatic systems.64,65 This study suggests that these trends may reduce photobleaching
of color (or CDOM) and DIC photoproduction in some instances because
the chromophores of Fe(III) photobleach poorly and cannot efficiently
mediate DIC photoproduction at pH >∼7. In naturally and
anthropogenically
acidic surfaces or atmospheric waters instead, Fe stimulates the photobleaching
of CDOM and can enhance DIC photoproduction remarkably at wavelengths
>500 nm.

for solid phase extraction (SPE) with Bond Elut PPL cartridges (Agilent
Technologies), which previously retained 76% of DOC in humic lake
water.31,32 Prior to SPE, water was acidified to pH
≈ 2 with hydrochloric acid (HCl; Merck, Germany) and equilibrated
overnight with 0.01 M fluoride (NaF; Merck, Germany), which was added
as a ligand to complex Fe.4 These complexes
and the unbound F– passed the SPE cartridge during
extraction. To evaluate the retention of Fe in the SPE-DOM, we collected
water before and after SPE cartridge and preserved the water samples
with super-pure nitric acid (Romil, U.K.) for Fe determination. (Total
iron measurement is described in the Supporting Information.) The concentration of Fe was 3.42 ± 0.034
and 3.45 ± 0.044 μmol L–1 (mean ±
SD) in triplicated water samples before and after the SPE cartridge,
respectively. The negligible difference indicates that the SPE-DOM
was free of Fe within the analytical accuracy (≤0.04 μmol
L–1) of determination. In agreement with this finding,
the measured concentration of total Fe was 0.04 ± 0.002 μmol
L–1 in the aqueous solutions of SPE-DOM (10 mg DOM
L–1) used for the experiments.

Ultrapure water
(Ultra Clear UV UF TM system; Evoqua Water Technologies) was used
in all experiments. The Fe solutions were prepared by dissolving iron
(III) sulfate hydrate (AnalaR, VWR International Ltd., U.K.) in 0.1
M HCl. All the quartz- and glassware used in the experiments were
soaked in 2% nitric acid (Merck, Germany) for >24 h, rinsed throughout
with ultrapure water, and pre-combusted at 450 °C for 4 h.

Experimental Design
To examine the combined impact
of pH and concentration of total iron (denoted [Fe]) on the spectral
properties of CDOM, the rates of photoreactions (photobleaching, DIC
photoproduction), and ϕλs, we generated the
associations between Fe and DOM (Fe-DOM) using the same concentration
of SPE-DOM (10 mg DOM L–1) but different loadings
of Fe on DOM at pH values ranging from 4 to 9.4 (Figure S2b, Table S2). The selected Fe loadings on DOM ranged
from 0.004 (no introduced Fe) to 3.5 μmol Fe mg DOM–1 (the highest amount of introduced Fe; Table S2, Figure S2b). The lowest loading represented the small amount
of Fe that was associated to SPE-DOM despite our attempts to isolate
entirely Fe-free DOM using a Fe-complexing ligand (F–) during the extraction. Our lowest loading was substantially smaller
than the median (0.357 μmol Fe mg DOM–1) found
in large Swedish and Canadian lakes among 58 888 water samples
examined.1 The largest loading was representative
of the upper 10% of loadings (2.0–12.8 μmol Fe mg DOM–1) observed in 6128 Finnish river water samples.33 Our lowest experimental pH (pH 4) corresponded
to that found in naturally acidic boreal streams18 or acidified atmospheric waters.34 The highest experimental pH (pH 9.4) represented pH values found
in alkaline soda lakes or even in circumneutral lakes during algal
blooms.35

To find the optimal combinations
of [Fe] and pH values across the anticipated range of loadings and
pH, we selected nine combinations according to a central-composite
design and replicated five of them (Figure S2, Tables S1 and S2). To highlight the effect of pH with high
[Fe] and without Fe, we introduced five additional combinations from
pH 4 to 9.4 and from 0.004 to 3.5 μmol Fe mg DOM–1, which resulted in a total of 20 experiments (Table S2, Figure S2). The Pearson correlation coefficient
between [Fe] and pH was 0.09 (p value >0.1), showing
that the selected combinations of pH and [Fe] were not correlated
and that pH and [Fe] were independent predictor variables in the statistical
analyses.

To evaluate the changes in optical properties and
to measure DIC
photoproduction, the selected 20 combinations of Fe-DOM were exposed
to simulated solar radiation. The optical properties were measured
prior to irradiation, from the irradiated Fe-DOM and their corresponding
dark controls. For the determination of ϕλs,
the DIC photoproduction was related to the number of absorbed photons
by CDOM.

Preparation of Fe-DOM
The acidic (pH ≈ 1.2)
solutions for experiments were prepared as a 1:1 mixture of SPE-DOM
solution and Fe(III) solution in a 500 mL gas exchange flask (see
the graphical abstract) to final concentrations of 10 mg DOM L–1 and [Fe] between 0 and 35 μmol of the introduced
Fe(III) L–1 (Table S2). The solutions were adjusted to pH 2 with NaOH and bubbled with
CO2-free air (2 L min–1) for 30–45
min to reduce the background DIC concentration. To associate Fe(III)
with DOM, the pH of solutions inside the gas exchange flasks were
raised slowly with NaOH to the selected pH values (Table S2, Figure S2b). This type of titration leads to the
mononuclear binding of Fe on DOM36 or to
the colloids of Fe(III)(oxy)hydroxide stabilized by DOM.19,20 According to a chemical equilibrium modeling described in the Supporting Information, Fe(III) was bound entirely
on DOM in the experiments #1–13 at ≤1.8 μmol Fe
mg DOM–1 but in the experiments #14–20 up
to 28% of Fe(III) existed as iron(oxy)hydroxides (Table S2). No visual precipitates were observed at any stage
of the experiments. The absence of precipitates suggested that Fe(III)(oxy)hydroxide
colloids were stabilized by DOM.19,20 For the statistical
analyses, we used the total concentration of Fe in the experiments
because both Fe complexed by DOM and iron(oxy)hydrodixes affect optical
properties25,26 and can induce DIC photoproduction.2,3

Each Fe-DOM solution was tapped in a set of one quartz and
two glass vials overflowing with a volume of the vial (∼12
mL) more than three times and sealed without headspace using ground
glass stoppers. The quartz vial was exposed to simulated solar radiation
(labeled “irradiated”). One glass vial was placed in
an ice water bath (0 °C; “initial”). The other
glass vial was wrapped in aluminum foil (“dark control”)
but otherwise treated identically as the quartz vial.

Simulated Solar
Irradiation
Solutions in quartz vials
were irradiated for 5 h (765 W m–2) using an Atlas
Suntest CPS+ solar simulator (Atlas Material Testing Technology),
as described previously37 and in the Supporting Information. For the irradiation at
+20 °C, the quartz vials were placed on a stainless steel grid
immersed in a water bath, along with the dark controls. The spectral
photon flux densities (mol photons m–2 s–1 nm–1) incident to the quartz vials from above
and below were measured from 240 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals with
a spectroradiometer (SR991; Macam Photometrics, Scotland, U.K.). These
measurements, together with characterization of downwelling and upwelling
light fields, allowed us to calculate the spectral absorption of photons
by CDOM in the irradiated samples, accounting for vial dimension,
inner filtering effects, and CDOM photobleaching during irradiation
(Supporting Information).

Analytical
Measurements
After the irradiation, the
DIC concentration and the spectral absorption by CDOM was measured
from the irradiated, dark control, and initial samples. The DIC concentration
was determined as a median of multiple (n = 3) injections
into an inorganic carbon reaction vessel of a TOC analyzer (TOC-LCPH; Shimadzu, Japan; detection limit 0.3 μmol C L–1). The analyzer was 6-point calibrated with sodium
hydrogen carbonate (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Japan) standard solutions
on each measurement day. The analytical precision ranged from 0.18
to 2 μmol C L–1 for individual DIC determination,
with a median of 0.28 μmol C L–1 for all determinations.
The concentration of DIC was identical in the initial and dark control
samples (95% confidence intervals for the difference were between
−0.51 and 0.18 μmol C L–1). This lack
of difference indicated that all vials received initially the same
DIC concentration and that any dark processes modifying the DIC concentration
were negligible. DIC photoproduction was calculated as the difference
in the DIC concentration between the irradiated and the corresponding
dark control sample.

The spectral absorption by CDOM was measured
with a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Lambda 850; PerkinElmer) in
a 1 cm quartz cuvette. The apparent absorbance of CDOM and blanks
(ultrapure water) was first measured from 190 to 700 nm at 1 nm steps
against air (i.e., an empty reference cell holder). The absorption
coefficient of CDOM at wavelength λ (aλ; m–1) was calculated from eq 1 1  where Asolution,λ and Ablank,λ are the apparent
absorbance of DOM solution and blank, respectively, and l is the path length of the cuvette (m).

The CDOM spectral slope
coefficients were calculated as a linear
fit to ln-transformed aλ for two
spectral regions: 275–295 nm (S275–295; nm–1) and 350–400 nm (S350–400; nm–1). The slope ratio
(SR; dimensionless) was expressed as SR = S275–295 (S350–400)−1, according to Helms et al.38

The
initial and its corresponding dark control samples had identical aλ, S275–295, S350–400, and SR (Tables S5, S6), indicating
negligible changes in the optical properties of CDOM due to the sample
treatment without the irradiation. The photochemistry-induced changes
in optical properties were calculated by subtracting the values of
dark controls from those of irradiated solutions.

Calculation
of AQY Spectrum
The ϕλ (mol C mol
photons–1 at wavelength λ) was
calculated by dividing the amount of photoproduced DIC with the number
of photons absorbed by CDOM in the Fe-DOM solutions during the irradiations
as in Aarnos et al.37 but now with a Monte
Carlo approach (details in Supporting Information). In these calculations, it was assumed that ϕλ decreases exponentially with increasing wavelength. 2  where c represents AQY (mol
C mol photons–1) at the reference wavelength (0
nm) and d is spectral slope coefficient for ϕλ (nm–1). This assumption was adapted
from the earlier determinations of ϕλ for DIC
photoproduction (Supporting Information) and for Fe(III) photoreduction.27,29

Statistical
Analyses
The dependencies of the optical
properties of CDOM and the photochemical transformations of DOM on
[Fe] and pH were explored with eight competing regression models (Supporting
Information, Tables S8–S18). The
models tested the explanatory power of [Fe] and pH separately, together,
or through the interaction of [Fe] and pH (Tables S8–S18). For the statistical analyses, pH was expressed
as the concentration of hydrogen ion ([H+]; = 10–pH) using the same unit (mol L–1) as for [Fe]. For
the visualization of models in Figures 1–4, [H+] was
transformed back to pH. To identify the simplest statistically significant
dependence between the response and the predictor variables, we sought
for the most parsimonious model among those candidate models that
included only significant terms. From those models, the best one was
selected on the basis of the corrected Akaike Information Criterion
(AICc)39,40 to provide the simplest significant dependence
of the optical properties or photochemical transformation of DOM on
pH and [Fe]. Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB R2013a
(The MathWorks Inc.) and R (version 3.3.3, R Core Team 2017).
