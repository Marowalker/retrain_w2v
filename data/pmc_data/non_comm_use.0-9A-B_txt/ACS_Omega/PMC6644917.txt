In
this article, interaction between ZnCdSeS quantum dot (QD) and
phthalocyanines with variable linker has been reported. Steady-state
and time-resolved spectroscopic investigation reveals that only photoinduced
energy transfer occurs from QD to phthalocyanines. To evaluate quantitatively
the energy transfer, the Poisson statistics of QD–dye complex
formation was used in the analysis of steady-state and time-resolved
emission quenching, which allows to estimate the energy transfer rate
constant for an ideal one-to-one complex. The measured rate constants
are compared to the rates evaluated based on the classic Förster
theory, which shows roughly 1 nm discrepancy in the energy transfer
distance estimation, or one order in magnitude discrepancy in the
transfer rate constants.

1 Introduction
In
the last few decades, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have
gained growing interests due to their advanced photophysical properties,
versatile functionalities, and wide range of applications in solar
cells, optoelectronic devices, and sensors.1−3 Besides, core
and core–shell type QDs, alloyed QDs have also attracted attention
because of their tunable optical properties by varying the composition
of the QDs without changing the particle’s size.4−6 It has been reported that the alloyed QDs such as ZnCdSe QDs without
shell have better charge injection ability compared to those CdSe/ZnS
core–shell QDs.7 Even, more advanced
photophysical properties can be achieved by combining QDs with organic
dyes to form QD–dye hybrids for the benefits of both components
in a single architecture.8−12 A large number of research works has been reported on QD–dye
hybrids with two types of photoinduced interactions, namely, energy
transfer and charge transfer, and there are few examples of QD–dye
hybrids where competition between these two reactions was observed.8,13−21 In QD–dye hybrids, QDs act as perfect energy donors because
of their extended absorption spectra and high extinction coefficient,
whereas higher conductance band (CB) energy of QDs compared to lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of various dyes may also favor
a competing charge transfer process upon excitation of QDs. However,
quantitative characterization of either of the processes, energy and
charge transfer, remains a challenging task.19,22 Although Förster-type resonance energy transfer is a common
approach to analyze energy transfer in QD–organic dye hybrids,
the quantitative analysis is complicated by the statistical nature
of hybrid formation and inhomogeneity of QD properties observed as
essentially nonexponential decay of emission of pure QDs.12,22 There are also reports on unusual distance dependence on the energy-transfer
efficiency on the length of linker connecting QD and energy acceptor.13

An important advantage of QD–dye
hybrid is the relative
ease of hybrid fabrication. Organic dyes with proper binding groups
can easily form the complexes spontaneously in the solutions.23 Though the downside of this advantage is that
it is impossible to control the number of dyes attached to a single
QD, or inherent statistics of the hybrid formation.

Among the
various organic dye molecules, phthalocyanines are outstanding
for light harvesting due to their high molar absorption coefficient
in the red–near-infrared region and high thermal as well as
chemical stability.24,25 They have already shown potential
applications in various fields such as solar cell, photodynamic therapy,
and infrared sensors.26−30 Therefore, QD–phthalocyanine hybrids with advanced properties
would be excellent materials for solar energy conversion. Lee et al.
showed that PbS QD–carboxyphthalocyanine (TT1) composite in
solid state had high efficiency for panchromatic harvesting of light.11 There are few examples of QD–phthalocyanine
hybrids, where efficient energy transfer or charge transfer was observed
from QD to phthalocyanine.31−34 Recently, our group reported an ultrafast charge
transfer from photoexcited CdSe QD to free base phthalocyanine.34 However, photophysics of the hybrids was affected
by phthalocyanine aggregation and no interaction between QD and phthalocyanine
was observed when the phthalocyanine counterpart was excited. Up to
date, it is well known that energy transfer may occur from QD to phthalocyanines;
however, the factors affecting energy transfer rate and efficiency
are not well understood.

In the present study, we investigated
the photophysical interactions
between ZnCdSeS QD (core without shell, good electron/energy donor)
and three different phthalocyanines (TT1, TT3, and TT6) in QD–phthalocyanine
hybrids. The CB energy of QD is higher than that of LUMOs of phthalocyanines,
which thermodynamically favors the electron transfer from QD to phthalocyanine.
However, it has been observed that only efficient energy transfer
occurred from QD to phthalocyanines. The energy transfer from QD to
three different phthalocyanines, depending on the length of linker
and aggregation of the phthalocyanines, has been investigated using
steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. Poisson statistics was
employed to obtain quantitative information on the energy transfer
rate constants in ideal one-to-one QD–phthalocyanine hybrids.
The rate of energy transfer was also calculated based on the Förster
model accounting for hybrid geometry and measured emission and absorption
spectra of the energy donor and acceptor. Comparison of the measured
and calculated rate constants indicates that the direct application
of the Förster theory may lead to erroneous results.

2 Results
2.1 Differential Pulse Voltammetry
(DPV) Measurement
The DPV measurements were carried to estimate
the valence band
(VB) and conductance band (CB) energy of the QD and highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO)–LUMO energies of the phthalocyanines. Figure 1 shows the DPV curves
of TT1 (see the Supporting Information (SI), Figure S1 for the DPV curves of QD and TT3 and TT6). The estimated
VB of the QD is −4.68 eV vs vacuum level and considering the
absorption peak of QD, the CB is −2.60 eV vs vacuum level.
The TT1 HOMO and LUMO energies relative to vacuum level are −4.71
and −3.06 eV, respectively. It is to be noted that the corresponding
HOMO–LUMO of TT3 and TT6 are roughly same as that of TT1, as
expected (detailed calculation of DPV of QD and three phthalocyanines
are given in the SI). Because the LUMOs
of phthalocyanines have lower energy than the CB of QD, there is a
possibility of electron transfer from QD to phthalocyanines upon the
excitation of QD.

2.2 Steady-State Absorption and Evidences for
Aggregation at High Concentrations
Absorption spectra of
QD and QD–phthalocyanine complexes were measured at a constant
concentration of QD and different concentrations of phthalocyanine. Figure 2A shows the absorption
spectra of QD and different molar ratios QD/TT1 of the hybrids. Interestingly,
TT1 is poorly soluble in hexane and becomes aggregated, but the carboxylic
acid group of the TT1 has a stronger binding to ZnCdSeS surface than
amine,35 and in the presence of QD, TT1
replaces the amine ligands at/on the QD surfaces to form the complex
and to place itself between alkyl tails of the ligands, which precludes
the aggregation of TT1 at least at low TT1 relative concentrations.
In the absence of QD, same concentration of TT1 shows different absorption
spectra with very low absorbance value in hexane compared to QD–TT1
complex (see the SI, Figure S2), which
is an indication of the QD–TT1 complex formation. Similarly,
QD–TT3 and QD–TT6 hybrids are also formed.

spectra of QD and QD–TT1 hybrids. (B) Normalized
absorption spectra of TT1 after the subtraction of QD absorption.
(C) Normalized absorption spectra of TT1 in tetrahydrofuran (THF)
and in QD–TT1 hybrid.

A careful examination of the absorption spectra shows that
as relative
concentration of TT1 in QD–TT1 hybrids increases, the optical
density of TT1 increases but not in direct proportion at the higher
concentration of TT1. It may be due to the aggregation of TT1 on the
QD surface. To clarify this point, absorption spectra of TT1 have
been normalized after the subtraction of QDs absorption from QD–TT1
hybrids (depicted in Figure 2B). The spectra have the same shapes up to QD/TT1 = 1:2 ratios,
but the relative absorption in the wavelength region of 600–650
nm is higher for 1:5 and 1:10 samples compared to 1:1 and 1:2 hybrids.
This observation implies that there is no detectable aggregation of
TT1 in QDs–TT1 complex at relative TT1 concentration upto 1:2,
but some aggregation features appear at ratio 1:5 and higher.

Figure 2C compares
the spectra of TT1 in THF solvent (good solvent for TT1) and 1:1 complex
after the subtraction of QD absorption. Only a minor shift in the
Q-band absorption was observed for the QD–TT1 hybrid, but the
bandwidth stays essentially unchanged. A small spectral shifting may
be due to the difference in the environment and the complex formation
through the interaction between carboxylic group of TT1 and QDs surfaces.
Compared to the QD–TT1 hybrids, some minor aggregation features
can be noticed for TT3 and TT6 samples already in the 1:2 complexes
with QDs (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3 for QD–TT3 and Figure S4 for QD–TT6). It may be due to the variation in linker between
the carboxylic acid group and the main skeleton of the phthalocyanines.
In the case of TT1, carboxylic group is directly attached to the main
skeleton of the phthalocyanine, whereas TT3 and TT6 contain carboxylic
group with ethylene and phenyl linker, respectively.

2.3 Steady-State Emission Quenching
The
emission spectra of QD and QD–TT1 hybrid with different ratios
are shown in Figure 3A. Increase in TT1 concentration leads to a decrease in the emission
intensity of QDs. The plausible reasons for the fluorescence quenching
of QD in the presence of TT1 are (a) electron transfer between QD
and TT1, (b) energy transfer from QD to TT1, and (c) both electron
and energy transfer. It is seen that there is good overlap (shown
in Figure 3B) between
the absorption spectrum of TT1 (after the subtraction of absorption
of QD from 1:1 QD–TT1 complex) and emission spectrum of QD
with the overlap integral value of 2.49 × 10–13 M–1 cm3, indicating the possibility
of energy transfer from QD to TT1. Furthermore, in addition to the
fluorescence quenching of QD in the QD–TT1 complex, there is
a formation of new emission peak at 690 nm, which is assigned tentatively
to energy-transfer-mediated TT1 fluorescence.

Figure 3 (A) Emission spectra
of QD and QD–TT1 hybrids and (B) overlap
between absorption spectrum of TT1 and emission spectrum of QD.

The emission spectra of QD, QD–TT3,
and QD–TT6 have
also been measured (see the SI, Figure S5). The fluorescence quenching of QD was observed and has essentially
similar trend for QD–TT3 and QD–TT6 hybrids. The calculated
overlap integral values are 4.05 × 10–13 and
5.63 × 10–13 M–1 cm3 for TT3 and TT6, respectively (the absorption spectra of TT3 and
TT6 were taken from their respective 1:1 complex, and the overlap
spectra are given in the SI Figure S6).
The overlap integrals were calculated based on the molar absorption
of the phthalocyanines in hybrids and normalized emission spectrum
of QD. The molar absorption of phthalocyanines were evaluated from
the phthalocyanine absorption spectra in hybrids after subtracting
the absorption of QDs, as presented in Figure 2B, and thus accounts for the specific phthalocyanine
environment in the hybrid (including possible aggregation effects).
The overlap integral values increase the in order TT1 < TT3 <
TT6, though the values are reasonably close to each other. The difference
may be due to minor structural differences in the phthalocyanines
and somewhat higher aggregation of TT3 and TT6 than that of TT1 on
the QD surface. It is to be noted that quantitative evaluation of
the aggregation degree is complicated because the types of aggregates,
their spectra, and molar absorption are not known.

2.4 Emission Decays
Time-correlated single
photon counting (TCSPC) was used to determine the emission lifetimes
of QD and different QD–phthalocyanine hybrids. The samples
were excited at 405 nm, which selectively excites QD (negligible absorption
of phthalocyanine at this wavelength), and emission was monitored
at 605 nm (emission of QD) and 690 nm (emission of phthalocyanine). Figure 4A shows the emission
decay curves of QD and the corresponding QD–TT1 hybrids at
the monitoring wavelength of 605 nm. It is to be noted that even the
emission decay of pure quantum dot is not monoexponential. A multiexponential
decay model has been used to obtain a reasonable fit. In addition
to the individual lifetime components, average lifetimes of the QD
and corresponding hybrids have been calculated and summarized in Table 1. It has been observed
that the lifetime of the QD decreases with the increasing concentration
of TT1, consistent with the similar trend observed in the fluorescence
intensity quenching. Emission decays of QD–TT3 and QD–TT6
hybrids (see the SI, Figure S7 for emission
decay curves and Tables S1 and S2 for fit
decay parameters) follow the similar trend as expected.

The emission
decay curves of QD–TT1 hybrids at the monitoring
wavelength of 690 nm are shown in Figure 4B. The emission decay curves were fitted
by triexponential model and the fastest components had negative pre-exponential
factors, indicating a rise in emission (for fitting parameters, see
the SI, Table S3). Rising components have
also been observed in the case of QD–TT3 and QD–TT6
hybrids (emission decay curves are given in the SI, Figure S7B,D for QD–TT3 and QD–TT6, respectively).

2.5 Transient Absorption (TA) Spectroscopy
Time-resolved TA spectroscopic measurements of QD and QD–Pc
hybrids were carried out using femtosecond pump–probe system.
The transient absorption response of QD suspension at the excitation
wavelength of 480 nm is shown in the SI, Figure S8.

At delay times of 1 ps and longer, it mainly shows
bleaching of the lower-energy absorption band of QD, which recovers
slowly in hundred picosecond to ten nanosecond time domain. Addition
of TT1 does not change the transient absorption response at short
delay times, <10 ps, but changes the response gradually at long
delays (Figure 5).
At the qualitative level, there is a clear bleaching of the TT1 absorption
around 685 nm, which develops in a few hundred picosecond time. There
is also some change in the near-IR transient absorption spectrum shape,
it becomes “flatter”. However, there is no evidence
of any cation or anion formation during the photoexcitation relaxation.
The details of the TA spectra fitting, discussion, and few more TA
spectra can be found in the SI, Figures S9–S11.

3 Discussion
3.1 Dependence of Quenching on Concentration
The addition
of phthalocyanine solutions into the QD suspension
results in quenching of both emission intensity and lifetime of the
QDs. The quenching increases with the increasing concentration of
phthalocyanines (calculated quenching efficiency based on average
lifetimes are given in the SI, Table S4). The quenching concentration dependence is presented in Figure 6 (for TT3 and TT6
given in the SI, Figure S12). At low concentration
of TT1, the emission intensity quenching and average lifetime quenching
are almost same. However, at higher concentration of TT1, there is
a small difference between emission intensity and average lifetime
quenching. The difference between emission intensity quenching and
average lifetime quenching is somewhat greater in QD–TT3 and
QD–TT6 hybrids. This discrepancy originates from the time resolution
of the instruments used (roughly 0.1 ps) for lifetime measurements
most probably. At higher concentrations, the quenching is faster,
and the fast decay is ill resolved at the ratio 1:10.

Figure 6 Relative decrease in
emission intensity and average lifetime as
a function of relative TT1 content for the different QD–TT1
hybrids (standard deviations for calculated average lifetimes are
in the range of 4–10%).

The plausible mechanisms for the quenching of QD are charge
transfer
(CB energy of QD is higher compared to the LUMOs of the phthalocyanines)
and energy transfer (good overlap between the absorption spectrum
of phthalocyanine and emission spectrum of QD). However, the emission
at phthalocyanine fluorescence wavelength (emission intensity of QD–Pc
at 690 nm is higher than that of Pc in THF with the same concentration
of Pc, see the SI, Figure S13A), and more
importantly the presence of the rising component at the emission wavelength
of the phthalocyanine fluorescence, 690 nm (emission decay of TT1
in THF at 405 nm excitation is also given in the SI Figure S13B for comparison), indicate that the energy transfer
takes place from QDs to phthalocyanine. This is also confirmed by
the transient absorption spectroscopy studies showing no characteristic
features (for example, occurrence of radical cations of electron donor
and radical anion of electron acceptor) of charge transfer from QD
to phthalocyanine or phthalocyanine to QD in the QD–phthalocyanine
hybrids, but is consistent with energy transfer (slow rise of phthalocyanine
ground state absorption bleaching around 690 nm). Therefore, the charge
transfer process is ruled out in this system, and we can focus on
our analysis of the QD emission quenching on the energy transfer.
It is to be noted that the energy-transfer analysis based on the rise
time of phthalocyanine energy acceptor is more complicated and less
accurate. The emission intensity at 690 nm is much weaker compared
to that at 605 nm (see the SI, Figure S14), and the decay profile depends on the lifetime of the phthalocyanine
energy acceptor, which interferes with the energy transfer time constant.

It is usually assumed that at nanometer distances, the energy transfer
follows the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) model.
In general, FRET is a process involving the nonradiative energy transfer
from a “donor” fluorophore to an appropriate “acceptor”
counterpart. This process arises from the dipole–dipole interactions
and strongly depends upon the center-to-center distance of the corresponding
energy donor and acceptor. According to the Förster theory,
the rate constant of the energy transfer for an isolated single donor–acceptor
pair separated by a distance r is given by the following
equation36 1  where τD is the
lifetime
of the donor in the absence of the acceptor and R0 is known as the Förster distance, the distance
at which the transfer rate constant kT(R0) is equal to the excited state decay
rate constant of the donor in the absence of acceptor. The Förster
distance (R0) can be estimated as 2  where ϕD is the quantum yield
of donor in the absence of acceptor, N is the Avogadro’s
number, n0 is the refractive index of
medium, and κ2 is the orientation factor of two dipoles
interacting. The value of κ2 depends on the relative
orientation of the donor and the acceptor dipoles. For randomly oriented
dipoles, κ2 = 2/3, which varies between 0 and 4 for
the cases of orthogonal and parallel dipoles, respectively. J(λ) is the spectral overlap integral, which is defined
as 3  where FD(λ)
is the normalized emission spectrum of donor, εA(λ)
is the molar absorption coefficient of acceptor at the wavelength
λ (in nm). The calculated R0 for
QD–TT1, QD–TT3, and QD–TT6 hybrids are 40, 44,
and 46 Å, respectively.

3.2 Poisson Distribution of
Pc in Hybrid
To analyze the emission intensity as well as
the average lifetime
quenching of QD in QD–Pc hybrids, we can assume that the simultaneous
formation of hybrids with different QD–Pc ratios is described
reasonably well by Poisson statistics15,37,38 4  where n is the number of
phthalocyanine molecules in the hybrid, Pn is the probability to find a hybrid with n phthalocyanines, and c is the relative
molar concentration of phthalocyanines in the sample solutions, as
denoted in Figures 2–6.

To model QD emission decays,
one can use the Poisson statistics of the hybrid formation and sum
up the decays of QDs with different number of phthalocyanines and
thus having different quenching rate constants, which was shown to
yield15 5  where τ0 is the lifetime
of a nonhybridized QD, τET is the energy transfer
time constant from the exited QD to single phthalocyanine, c is the relative concentration of phthalocyanines, and A0 is a constant determined by the initial population
of the excited state.

Unfortunately, the decay model of eq 5 cannot be applied directly
to the measured decays
because the relaxation of excited QD is not monoexponential, which
indicates inhomogeneity due to the presence of surface traps and different
sort of defects. To overcome the problem of QD inhomogeneity, the
hybrid decays were normalized to the decay of pure QD. Then, the fit
model of eq 5 was applied
simultaneously to all normalized decays at different concentrations
of phthalocyanine quencher, which resulted in common τ0 and τET values and a set of relative concentrations
for each sample. The fitted curves for QD–phthalocyanines are
shown in Figure 7,
and the fit results are summarized in Table 2.

QD–TT1	34	0.38 (0.92)	0.98
(0.88)	1.52 (0.90)	1.89 (0.91)	1.71	
QD–TT3	34	0.53 (1.02)	1.02 (1.09)	1.27 (1.17)	2.54 (1.53)	1.49	
QD–TT6	34	0.50 (1.04)	1.17 (1.09)	1.50 (1.17)	1.92 (1.29)	1.44	
It should be noted that strictly speaking the value
of τ0 must be infinitely long in this case because
the decays were
already normalized to the natural decay of the QDs alone. However,
the obtained value is much longer than the time interval used for
fitting, 10 ns; therefore, τ0 can be considered to
be sufficiently large. The energy transfer time constant is close
to 1.5 ns for all three phthalocyanines, which is shorter than the
average lifetimes reported in Table 1 for all samples. According to the model, τET is the energy transfer time constant in exactly one-to-one
complex, whereas the average lifetime reported in Table 1 accounts for all combinations
on hybrids, in which case, QDs without phthalocyanines have a relatively
high contribution due to a rather long lifetime of unquenched QDs
(because τ0 ≫ τET).

The fit uses concentration, c, as a free parameter,
and it comes out that the concentration estimated from the quenching
dynamics is two or more times lower than the intended concentration.
However, the calculated values for 1:2 hybrids are roughly double
compared to that for 1:1. The estimated concentration increases further
for 1:5 and 1:10 hybrids, though the relative increase is smaller
that expected. This can be explained by the aggregation tendency of
the phthalocyanine used, which leads to a change in absorption spectrum
and becomes noticeable for 1:5 and 1:10 samples. The concentration
discrepancy at low concentration (1:1 and 1:2 samples) cannot be attributed
to the aggregation. In fact, according to the Poisson statistics of
the hybrid formation, the relative emission yield of the sample prepared
by mixing equal number of QD–phthalocyanines (1:1 sample) is
0.37 if the quenching time constant is much shorter than the QD lifetime
and 0.42 if the time constants are 1.7 and 34 ns for τ0 and τET, respectively (presumably, the case of
QD/TT1 hybrids). The measured value is 0.48, or 15–30% higher
than the expected one. This rises the question on the accuracy of
the relative concentration estimation based on the absorptions. The
most significant source of inaccuracy is the concentration of QDs,
which was estimated from the analytical dependence of the QD molar
absorption on the size and thus the position of the lowest energy
absorption band. The dependence was established for CdSe core-only
dots, but alloyed dots were used in this study. This can result in
15–30% systematic error in the QD concentration estimation.
Arguably, the estimation made on the basis of Poisson statistics of
hybrid formation can be considered as more reliable, as the latter
is based on the simultaneous analysis of the whole series of measurements.

Furthermore, we have re-evaluated the QD/Pc ratios accounting for
the steady-state emission and emission decay data scaled by 0.85 and
plotted theoretical quenching dependence, one presuming τ0 ≫ τET and another taking τ0 = 34 ns, τET = 1.7 ns, in Figure 8. These results suggest the
QD/Pc ratios to be 1:0.85 and 1:1.7 in place of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively.
According to this model, the rates of energy transfer are 5.80 ×
108, 6.67 × 108, and 7.01 × 108 s–1 for QD–TT1, QD–TT3, and
QD–TT6 hybrids, respectively, i.e., the rate of energy transfer
increases from QD–TT1 to QD–TT6, as expected from the
overlap integral value of three different phthalocyanines–QD
hybrids.

0.85 and presuming τ0 ≫ τET (P0, blue line) and taking τ0 = 34 ns, τET = 1.7 ns (red line, τ0 is the lifetime of a nonhybridized QD and τET is the energy transfer time constant).

3.3 Effect of Pc Linker on the Energy Transfer
Because FRET depends on the distance between donor and acceptor,
the Pc linker should play an important role in controlling the rate
of energy transfer in QD–Pc hybrids. Previously, Dayal et al.13 reported non-Förster-type energy transfer
(increased energy transfer efficiency for longer linker chain length)
in CdSe QD–silicon phthalocyanine conjugates. In this work,
the rates of energy transfer and overlap integrals were determined
from the experimental results and can be used to calculate the distance
between the donor and acceptor, r, within the FRET
framework. These experimental r values are 28, 30,
and 31 Å for TT1, TT3, and TT6 hybrids, respectively, and presented
in Table 3. The center-to-center
distance estimated based on the QD radius and assuming that phthalocyanines
are standing upright on the QD surface, rtheor, are 39, 43, and 42 Å, for TT1, TT3, and TT6, respectively.
Based on rtheor values, the calculated
rates of energy transfer are 7.8 × 107, 7.7 ×
107, and 11.6 × 107 s–1 for QD–TT1, QD–TT3, and QD–TT6 hybrids, respectively,
or almost one order in magnitude slower than the measured values.
This strong discrepancy rises the question on the applicability of
the classic FRET model to this case. The theory presumes that both
donor and acceptor are point dipoles. This approximation is hardly
acceptable for the QDs, which have non-negligible size and to some
extent can be considered as a surface to which a small energy acceptor
is attached. In other words, the electron density distribution in
the QD has to be accounted for and cannot be reduced to a point dipole
placed in the middle of QD. This was a known issue and, for example,
studied for the electronic excitation transfer from polyfluorene to
porphyrin,39 or in layered structures.40 The practical outcome of their study is that
the energy transfer is more efficient in QD–dye hybrids than
that predicted on the basis of classic Förster theory with

a r is the distance
between donor and acceptor (center-to-center) calculated from Poisson
distribution model and measured energy transfer rate constants, rtheor is the theoretical or geometric donor–acceptor
center-to-center distance, and kETT is
the rate constant calculate form the Förster theory and assuming
distance rtheor.

Three phthalocyanines used in this study differs by
the linker
between carboxyl anchor and chromophore core only. This looks like
an ideal platform to study the distance dependence of the energy transfer.
Comparison of TT1 and TT3 is the most straightforward in this respect,
with the only difference between the two being the phenyl group between
the phthalocyanine core and the carboxyl binding group. Phenyl is
a rigid group and one can expect an increase in separation distance
by roughly 4 Å in the case of upright orientation of the phthalocyanine
on the QD surface. However, the difference in r values
is only 2 Å. This can be interpreted in favor of a lower than
six order distance dependence. At the same time, one can notice that
the orientation of the carboxyl group is different in these two compounds.
It is expected to be out of phthalocyanine core plane in TT1 and most
probably in-plane in TT3. This means that a tilt of two Pcs can be
very different and alternative explanation of the small difference
is a larger tilt angle of TT3 compared to that of TT1.

The most
surprising result in the series is that according to the
relation between the energy transfer rates of three phthlocyanines,
TT6 is spaced further away from QD than two other phthalocyanines.
It seems that TT6 has the most upright orientation on the surface.
Though the difference between the three studied compounds is relatively
minor and can be well explained by minor differences in orientations
or factor κ2 in eq 2.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have investigated the energy transfer from ZnCdSeS
QD to three different phthalocyanines. Poisson statistical model has
been employed to evaluate the concentration ratio of QD–Pc
hybrids and to extract the energy transfer rate constants in ideal
one-to-one QD–dye complexes. The rates are compared with those
calculated using a traditional Förster energy transfer theory,
and we show that the theory underestimates the energy transfer rate
by roughly an order in magnitude. Our interpretation is that the point
dipole approximation is oversimplification in the case of quantum
dots, and a suitable theory must take into account the physical size
of the QD and probably the electron density distribution close to
the QD surface.

5 Methods and Materials
ZnCdSeS-alloyed quantum dots were purchased from PlasmaChem GmbH.
According to the manufacturer, the quantum dots are spherical with
the diameter of 6 nm. The quantum dots are capped with oleyl amine
and dispersible in nonpolar organic solvents. The QDs with the emission
wavelength of 610 ± 5 nm were used in this study. The quantum
yield of the QD was 10% and determined using rhodamine 6G as a standard
reference dye.

Three different phthalocyanines (TT1, TT3, and
TT6) were utilized
in this work. The molecular structures of these phthalocyanines have
been given in Scheme 1 and the synthesis of these phthalocyanines (Pc) have been described
elsewhere.41−43

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of TT1, TT3, and TT6 and Schematic
Presentation
of TT1–QD Hybrid
The supplied QDs (in powder form) were dispersed in hexane
and
solutions of phthalocyanines were prepared in tetrahydrofuran (THF).
The QD–Pc complexes were prepared by the addition of microliter
amount of Pc solution into the QD solution under vigorous stirring.
Different ratios of QD/Pc (1:1 to 1:10) were prepared by adding different
amount of phthalocyanine solution.

The differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) technique was used to
estimate the oxidation and reduction potentials of QD, TT1, TT3, and
TT6 using a Ag/AgCl wire as a pseudoreference electrode. Tetra-butylammonium
hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), 0.1 M, in chloroform was
used as the supporting electrolyte. After measuring the background,
a chloroform solution of each sample was added to the electrochemical
cell. To fix the reference potential, the measurements were repeated
after adding ferrocene (in chloroform) solution for each sample. The
measurements were carried out under a nitrogen flow in two directions:
toward the positive and the negative potential. The final values of
oxidation and reduction potentials were calculated as an average of
the two scans relative to a ferrocene standard as reference.

The UV–vis absorption spectra of QDs and QD–Pc complexes
were measured with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer.
The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with an ISA-Jobin
Yvon-SPEX-Horiba Fluorolog-3-111 fluorophotometer. The raw signals
were corrected using an instrument response function provided by the
manufacturer. The fluorescence lifetimes of the samples were measured
using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system by PicoQuant
GmbH. The TCSPC system consists of a PicoHarp controller and a PDL-800B
driver. The samples were excited by a pulsed laser diode (LDH-P-C-405)
at 405 nm. The fluorescence decays were monitored at the emission
maxima of quantum dots and emission maxima of phthalocyanines. The
time resolution of the TCSPC system was approximately 60 ps (full
width at half-maximum).

instrument used in this
work is provided in the Supporting Information (SI).
