Black phosphorus
(BP) is a recently rediscovered layered two-dimensional
(2D) semiconductor with a direct band gap (0.35–2 eV), high
hole mobility (300–5000 cm2/Vs), and transport anisotropy.
In this paper, we systematically investigated the effects of metal–semiconductor
interface/contacts on the performance of BP Schottky barrier transistors.
First, a “clean” metal–BP contact is formed with
boron nitride (BN) passivation. It is found that the contact resistance
of the clean metal–BP contact is seven times less than the
previously reported values. As a result, high-performance top-gate BP transistors show a
record high ON-state drain current (Ion) of 940 μA/μm. Second, BN tunneling barriers are formed
at the source/drain contacts to help understand the abnormally high
OFF-state drain current (Ioff) in devices
with clean metal–BP contacts. This high Ioff is attributed to the electron tunneling current from the
drain to the channel. Finally, the Ion/Ioff of BP field-effect transistors
can be significantly improved by using an asymmetric contact structure.
By inserting a thin BN tunneling barrier at the drain side, Ioff is reduced by a factor of ∼120 with
a cost of 20% reduction in Ion. This case
study of contacts on BP reveals the importance of understanding the
metal–semiconductor contacts for 2D Schottky barrier transistors
in general.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
materials have shown great potential in the
application of nanotransistors, especially for beyond 5 nm node technology.1−5 Among thousands of 2D materials, black phosphorus (BP) has triggered
intensive research interests owing to its unique material properties.6−8 Depending on the number of layers, the band gap of BP varies from
0.35 to 2.0 eV.9,10 The hole Hall mobility of BP
is as high as 5200 cm2/V s at room temperature with hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) passivation.11 BP
has a puckered honeycomb atomic structure, which leads to its highly
anisotropic transport characteristics.12,13 The moderate
direct band gap and high carrier mobility make BP a strong candidate
for high-performance transistor applications.14−19

However, field-effect transistors (FETs) based on most 2D
semiconductors
are Schottky barrier transistors.20−23 Namely, the transistor characteristics
are significantly affected by the source/drain Schottky contacts.
This phenomenon is more obvious for short-channel devices, where the
contact resistance is even more dominant than the channel resistance.
It is thus very important to form a low-resistance metal–semiconductor
contact to fully access the intrinsic material properties of the channel.
Typically, the contact resistance of 2D semiconductor FETs includes
three parts: (i) the Schottky barrier resistance (Rsb), which is the result of Fermi-level pinning and the
difference between the metal work function and the electron affinity
of the semiconductor; (ii) the tunneling resistance (Rt) owing to the existence of a physical gap between the
metal and the semiconductor. The physical gap may stem from any interfacial
oxide; and (iii) the interlayer resistance (Rinter) contacting from top layers to bottom layers. Rinter is usually much smaller than Rsb and Rt. However, in 2D
FETs, Rinter cannot be ignored, especially
for bottom-gate device owing to a significantly higher out-of-plane
effective mass, which is usually several times larger than the in-plane
effective mass.24

One disadvantage
of BP is that it easily reacts with O2 and H2O in an ambient environment forming an oxide after
cleaving from the bulk.25−27 The existence of this phosphorus
oxide/acid at the surface makes the formation of a clean and low-resistance
BP–metal interface complicated.28 This leads us to believe that much better contacts can be achieved
with a clean metal–BP interface by preventing the formation
of phosphorus oxide/acid. In this work, we demonstrate how to minimize
the total contact resistance (Rtotal = Rsb + Rt + Rinter) using several strategies, including high-work-function
contact metal, BN passivation, and top-gate structure. This allows
the BP contact resistance to be reduced to a record low value of 0.58
kΩ·μm, resulting in an Ion that exceeds 940 μA/μm.15 As a consequence, the Ioff is also increased
significantly in these low-resistance contact devices. To understand
the abnormally high Ioff, Rt is intentionally increased by adding a thin BN barrier
to the contact. It is found that the high Ioff is due to the reverse electron tunneling current on the drain side,
which can be suppressed by the BN tunneling barrier. Finally, by using
an asymmetric contact structure with a clean metal–BP contact
at the source and BN tunneling barrier at the drain, we have successfully
reduced Ioff by a factor of 120 with only
a 20% reduction in Ion.

Device Fabrication
Figure 1 shows the
device fabrication flow for fabricating top-gate BP FETs. Few-layer
BP flakes were exfoliated onto the 90 nm SiO2/p++ Si substrate. The BN thin film was grown on sapphire by metal–organic
chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with a thickness of 1.6 nm and a
root-mean-square roughness of 0.1 nm.29,30 The relative
dielectric constant of BN is about 3, which is similar to the reported
value of CVD BN.31 MOCVD BN was first transferred
onto the BP–SiO2–Si substrate (details in Materials and Methods). The source/drain region
was patterned by electron-beam lithography. After that, BN was etched
by a low-power Ar reactive ion etching (RIE) with an etching rate
of ∼1 nm/10 s. The BN thickness can be controlled by adjusting
the Ar etching time. Figure 2 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of BN etching
pattern after Ar RIE for 10 s. The roughness of BN increases from
0.1 nm to about 0.5 nm after RIE. Immediately after the etching process,
5 nm Pt/8 nm Ni/30 nm Al was deposited as the contact metals. A second
dielectric layer, 4 nm Al2O3, was deposited
by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200 °C after the metal lift-off
process. The total equivalent oxide thickness of the BN–Al2O3 top-gate dielectric layer is around 4 nm. Finally,
20 nm Ti/50 nm Au was deposited as the top-gate metal. All devices
were fabricated with the current flow along the high-mobility armchair
direction of BP, which was determined by polarization-dependent Raman
spectra using a HORIBA LabRAM HR800 Raman spectrometer with a 532.8
nm wavelength He–Ne laser. All devices have the same channel
length of 200 nm and a thickness between 4 and 12 nm. The characterization
of FETs was performed in air at room temperature by using a Keithley
4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer.

Results and Discussion
A cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
of the fabricated Al–Ni–Pt–BP contact is shown
in Figure 3a. A sharp
BP–Pt interface can be seen in the picture, although the 2D
crystal structure of BP is vague because of the damage caused during
the TEM sample preparation. Figure 3b shows the EDS element analysis along the Al–Ni–Pt–BP–SiO2 stack. No nitrogen or boron is detected (above the detection
limit), confirming that the BN barrier layer has been fully etched
away. Along the stack, the carbon signal is negligible showing that
the organic residue [polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or poly(methymethacrylate)
(PMMA)] has been removed because of the transfer process. However,
a significant amount of oxygen is still detected within the phosphorus
layer, even though BP has been fully isolated from O2 and
H2O by BN–Al2O3 passivation.
The effectiveness of BN–Al2O3 passivation
on BP has been confirmed by time-dependent Raman and electrical measurements,
as shown in the Supporting Information (accelerated
degradation experiment data of BP, BP–BN, and BP–BN–Al2O3 and time dependence of I–V characteristics of BP FETs with BN–Al2O3 passivation). Meanwhile, the I–V hysteresis has also been reduced to 0.25 V after BN–Al2O3 passivation.15 As
a result, it is very likely that the oxygen is introduced because
of exposure to air between the focused ion beam processing and TEM
imaging. If oxygen contamination occurred during exfoliating and processing,
a higher oxygen concentration would be expected at the Pt–BP
interface than at the BP–SiO2 interface.

analysis of Pt–BP contact by EDS. The signal of carbon, boron,
or nitrogen is below the detection limit. (c) I–V transfer curves of BP FETs with different contact metals:
Pt, Ni, and Ti. (d) TLM resistance of BP with Pt contact at zero back-gate
bias. Contact resistance is extracted to be 0.58 kΩ·μm,
which is seven times less than the previously reported value.

The selection of a contact metal
with the appropriate work function
is the critical first step to reducing Rc. Three contact metals with a range of work functions were investigated:
Pt (∼5.6 eV), Ni (∼5.2 eV), and Ti (∼4.33 eV). Figure 3c shows the transfer
curves of BP FETs with different source/drain metals. Clearly, the
FET with BP–Pt contacts performed the best, whereas BP–Ti
performed the worst. Interestingly, the device with Ti contacts shows
symmetric electron and hole transport, which indicates that the Fermi
level at the BP surface and the work function of Ti are aligned near
the middle of the band gap. This result is in good agreement with
the theoretical energy band diagram of the BP–Ti contact, in
which Ec and Ev of few-layer BP are about 4.1–4.2 and 4.5–4.7 eV,
respectively.19 Notably, there is a big
difference in the threshold voltage (Vt) between these devices with different contact metals. This is a
result of charge transfer from the floating BP channel to the contact
metal, where electrons tend to move from the high-potential region
(BP channel) to the low-potential region (metal). Consequently, Vt becomes more positive when a higher work function
(i.e., lower potential) metal is used.

The contact resistance
of BP–Pt contacts is measured with
the transfer length method (TLM) on a 12 nm thick sample. At zero
back-gate bias, the extracted Rc is about
0.58 kΩ·μm, and the sheet resistance is about 6.1
kΩ/square as shown in Figure 3d. Encouragingly, the measured Rc of the clean BP–metal contact is 1/7 of the previously
reported Rc for BP–Pd contacts.32 Because Pt and Pd have similar work functions,
the Schottky barrier height and Rsb of
the two contacts should be similar. Thus, the significant reduction
of total Rc is due to the contribution
of the other resistance factors: Rt and Rinter, which we will address later in this paper.

The transfer and output characteristics of a 7 nm thick BP FET
with Pt contact are shown in Figure 4a,b. Owing to the improvement of Rc, the 200 nm channel length device shows Ion as high as 940 μA/μm at a Vds of −2 V. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the highest Ion achieved among all
2D semiconductor-based FETs. However, the Ion/Ioff is about ∼103 at small drain bias (−0.1 V) and decreases to about ∼20
at large drain bias (−1 V). The Ioff increases to 200 μA/μm at a drain bias of −2
V, and the drain current in Figure 4b increases almost linearly with Vds and does not saturate. The abnormally high Ioff and nonsaturation phenomena have never been
reported for BP FETs. This phenomenon can be explained as follows.
First, few-layer BP has a small band gap approaching the bulk value
of 0.35 eV, and BP FETs are Schottky barrier transistors, that is,
the observed electrical characteristics are the outcomes of both the
channel and more importantly the contacts. In principle, the total
drain current of a Schottky barrier transistor contains (i) hole current
from source to drain and (ii) electron current from drain to source.
As can be seen from the band diagram in Figure 4c, in the ON state, the majority of the drain
current is the hole current injected from the source terminal. As
long as the holes are able to overcome the source Schottky barrier,
they can be collected at the drain side. In other words, the total
current level is mainly determined by the hole injection at source.
In the OFF state, the channel potential is pulled down by the gate
voltage to reduce the hole injection at source; however, this gate
bias also lowers the potential of the channel region near the drain
terminal. Meanwhile, the drain potential is lifted up by the negative
drain bias, which results in a steep potential gradient. As a result,
the electrons at the drain terminal can be injected into the conduction
band of a channel by tunneling through the triangle barrier. In other
words, by turning off the forward hole current, the reverse electron
current is turned on by top-gate bias. Indeed, this phenomenon is
universal for all the top-gate Schottky barrier transistors. However,
the reverse tunneling probability at the drain side is inversely related
to the Schottky barrier height for minority carriers. Consequently,
a high reverse tunneling current is observed in narrow band gap semiconductors.
For wide band gap 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2, the
drain-to-channel Schottky barrier for holes is so large that the tunneling
current can be ignored in the OFF state. So far, the device characteristics
have been well-explained by the transport model. However, for narrow
band gap BP devices, this raises important questions: what happens
in the BP devices with both low Ioff and Ion as reported in the literature and where does
this inconsistency come from?

and (h) OFF state for devices with BN barriers.

A possible explanation for the absence of a high reverse
tunneling
current in previously reported BP devices is the presence of a tunneling
barrier at the source/drain interface. This additional tunneling barrier
may stem from surface phosphorus oxide/acid formed during fabrication.
The presence of this tunneling barrier would explain why previous
works reported much higher Rc than what
we are reporting in this work. On the other hand, this tunneling barrier
blocks the reverse electron tunneling current, which leads to a low Ioff. To verify this hypothesis, we fabricated
BP FETs with a thin layer of BN intentionally kept at the source/drain
contacts. Figure 4e,f
shows the transfer and output characteristics of a BP FET with a thin
BN barrier (two layers) added to the source/drain contacts. The geometry
of this device is the same as the one without a BN barrier. However,
there are several clear differences between the electrical characteristics
of these two devices: (i) in the ON state, Ion of the device with BN contacts is 10 times lower than the
device without BN. The reduction of Ion is due to the additional tunneling barrier resistance Rt. (ii) In the linear region, the Id–Vd curve of the device
with BN is more linear than the device without BN owing to the Fermi-level
depinning.33,34Figure 4g shows the band diagram of the device with
BN contacts in the ON state. The Schottky barrier height becomes smaller
with Fermi-level depinning, and the Id–Vd curves become more linear.
However, Rt increases significantly with
insertion of a BN barrier in contacts. As a result, the total Rc (Rt + Rsb + Rinter) of
the device with BN is much larger than that of the device without
BN. This also tells us that the linear Id–Vd curves do not necessarily
indicate that an Ohmic contact has been achieved. (iii) In the saturation
region, the current saturates at Vds <
−0.5 V. Below this voltage, the drop across the tunneling barrier
becomes dominant. Increasing Vd no longer
improves the drain current. (iv) In the OFF state, Ioff is reduced by a factor of 400 at a Vds of −1 V due to the presence of the BN barrier
at the drain terminal, which reduces the reverse electron tunneling
current. Figure 4h
shows the band diagram of the device with BN contacts in the OFF state.
In short, the presence of a tunneling barrier at source/drain contacts
reduces Ion, leads to linear I–V (Fermi-level depinning), leads to current
saturation (Vd drop at contacts), and
reduces Ioff (blocks the reverse tunneling
current). All of these observations from our BP devices with BN barriers
are in good agreement with the characteristics of the previously reported
BP devices, which did not use any passivation method to avoid the
formation of phosphorus oxidation at contacts.7,8,14,16,21,32 As a result, for Schottky
barrier transistors, it is extremely important to distinguish between
the contribution from the contacts and the intrinsic channel to the
overall electrical characteristics.

Taking advantage of the
benefits of having a clean BP–metal
contact (high Ion) and a BN barrier contact
(low Ioff), we have demonstrated an asymmetric
source/drain contact structure to improve the Ioff, while keeping the Ion as high
as possible. It is well-known that in FETs Ion is mainly controlled by the electrostatics at the source
terminal. The asymmetry between source and drain can be used to suppress
either the electron or the hole current, depending on the sign of
the drain voltage.35−37 For BP Schottky barrier transistor, the majority
current (i.e., forward hole current) is determined by the potential
barrier from metal to the source contact region. The reverse electron
current can be suppressed by adding a tunneling barrier at the drain
terminal without losing too much hole current. Figure 5a–c shows the schematic diagram and
measurement configuration for a BP FET without BN barriers (device
A) and a BP FET with only one BN barrier (∼bilayer thickness)
at the drain (device B) or the source (device B′). Device A
and device B(B′) were fabricated from the same BP flake to
reduce potential variability between flakes. The output and transfer
curves of device A are shown in Figure 5d,g. The Ion and Ioff are about 638 and 84 μA/μm,
respectively, at a Vds of −1.6
V for the device without BN. With a BN tunneling barrier at the drain
side, the Ioff is reduced by a factor
of 120 to 700 nA/μm at a Vds of
−1.6 V, whereas Ion is still about
80% of the device without the BN barrier. Because Ion is mainly determined by the source contact, a BN barrier
at the drain does not have a significant impact. Figure 5f,i shows the output and transfer
curves of device B′ that has a BN barrier at the source terminal.
As expected, the device shows a much smaller Ion of 153 μA/μm and has current saturation as well.
We conclude that the reverse electron tunneling current or high Ioff current of BP FETs can be significantly
reduced by an asymmetric source/drain contact structure and contact
engineering.

In general, the strategies used
in this work can be applied to
other Schottky-type FETs. The strategies (i) include BN or other effective
passivation for environmentally sensitive materials; (ii) choose contact
metals with proper work function for either electron or hole transport;
and (iii) control/suppress the electron or hole current by tuning
the contact tunneling barrier. As a case study on BP, we have successfully
utilized these methods to improve the electrical performance of BP
FETs.

Conclusions
To summarize, the BP–metal contact
has been systematically
studied and improved, resulting in record low contact resistance.
As a result, record high Ion of BP FETs
has also been obtained. However, an abnormally high Ioff of BP FETs is also identified owing to the reverse
electron tunneling current at the drain terminal. By contact engineering,
the Ioff has also been significantly reduced
with minor sacrifice in Ion. All of these
results have shown the importance of contacts for its electrical characteristics
in Schottky barrier transistors.

Materials and Methods
BP Bulk
Synthesis
High-quality bulk BP was synthesized
from red phosphorus and SnI4–Sn in a sealed quartz
ampoule. A growth temperature between 500 and 600 °C for 20–50
h produced single crystals of BP.

BN Thin-Film Synthesis
Few-layer sp2 BN
was synthesized on 1/4
2 in. sapphire wafers by MOCVD at 1050 °C and 20 Torr from triethylborane
and ammonia with a III/IV source ratio of 2250. The Raman peak position
and full width at half maximum for the BN E2g mode are
1370 and 24 cm–1, respectively.

Transfer of
BN to the BP–SiO2 Substrate
BN–sapphire
samples (size of 5 mm × 5 mm) were coated
with a layer of PMMA A10 (3000 rpm, 2 min) and then a PDMS film (Gel-Pak,
PF-30-X4). The BN film was separated from the sapphire substrate after
etching in buffered oxide etch for 2–3 h at room temperature.
The PDMS–PMMA–BN film was rinsed and dried before transferring
to the BP–SiO2–Si substrate. The sample was
baked at 100 °C for 30 min after the transfer process to improve
the adhesion between BP and BN. The critical processes of BP exfoliation
and BN transfer were all performed in a glovebox with H2O and O2 concentrations <0.5 ppm to prevent the oxidation
of BP. PDMS can be lifted off, and PMMA is removed after soaking the
sample in acetone for about 20 min. A forming gas anneal at 200 °C
was used to remove any organic residue.
