11B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
a useful tool for studies of boron-containing compounds in terms of
structural analysis and reaction kinetics monitoring. A computational
protocol, which is aimed at an accurate prediction of 11B NMR chemical shifts via linear regression, was proposed based on
the density functional theory and the gauge-including atomic orbital
approach. Similar to the procedure used for carbon, hydrogen, and
nitrogen chemical shift predictions, a database of boron-containing
molecules was first compiled. Scaling factors for the linear regression
between calculated isotropic shielding constants and experimental
chemical shifts were then fitted using eight different levels of theory
with both the solvation model based on density and conductor-like
polarizable continuum model solvent models. The best method with the
two solvent models yields a root-mean-square deviation of about 3.40
and 3.37 ppm, respectively. To explore the capabilities and potential
limitations of the developed protocols, classical boron–hydrogen
compounds and molecules with representative boron bonding environments
were chosen as test cases, and the consistency between experimental
values and theoretical predictions was demonstrated.

1 Introduction
The
electron deficiency of boron enables fascinating chemistry.
The studies of the structure and reactivity of boron-containing molecules
have formed the basis of many important chemical concepts.1 Over the years, boron containing compounds have
found a wide range of applications in metallomimetic chemistry,2 materials science,3−5 and medicinal chemistry.6,7 The rapid development of boron chemistry is tightly coupled with
the application of 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy, which has been proved to be one of the most reliable
and efficient methods for structural elucidation.8−10 Such an analysis
enables effective elucidations of the chemical environment of boron
within a molecule, structural assignments of possible intermediate
states, as well as kinetics analysis of the reactions of interest.1111B NMR chemical shift analysis helps
convincingly in structural assignment, particularly in the cases for
which the X-ray crystallography study is challenging. For instance,
Marwitz et al. reported the first isolation and characterization of
1,2-dihydro-1,2-azaborine, a hybrid organic/inorganic benzene isoelectronic
structure through NMR analysis.12 Recently,
by monitoring the temperature-dependent 11B chemical shifts,
we have conclusively demonstrated that ammonium aminodiboranate, a
long-sought isomer of diammoniate of diborane and ammonia borane dimer,
is stable at −18 °C and decomposes at elevated temperatures.13

The development of various computational
methods for chemical shift
predictions further improves the capabilities of NMR spectroscopy
in structural assignments.8,14−18 With the introduction of density functional theory (DFT)19−23 and gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO)-based approach,24 the calculations of boron isotropic shielding
constants become accessible. At the same time, the application of
linear regression correlating calculated isotropic shielding constants
and experimental NMR values has also proved effective to improve the
prediction accuracy for 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts at relatively low computational costs.25−30 The linear regression between computed isotropic shielding constants
(σ) and experimental chemical shifts (δ) was performed
via the following equation 1  

There are two empirical scaling factors
that need to be fitted:
slope and intercept. The former is a correction to the systematic
error (the ideal value is −1), whereas the latter corresponds
to the choice of reference applied in the NMR measurement. Through
these two scaling factors, the calculated isotropic shielding constants
can be converted into chemical shifts with sufficient accuracy, for
instance, to allow distinguishing between different stereoisomers.29

In this work, effective predictions of 11B NMR chemical
shifts based on linear regression were investigated. First, a database
of boron-containing molecules was constructed. Second, we conducted
calculations of boron isotropic shielding constants via eight different
levels of theory along with two implicit solvent models for comparison.
To be consistent with the experimental data, tetrahydrofuran (THF)
was included as the solvent in our calculations. Third, the corresponding
linear regression scaling factors were derived, and the ones with
the best performance were subjected to further tests on a diverse
set of boron-containing molecules including a series of boron–hydrogen
compounds. Together with the previous work on 1H,25,2613C,26,30,31 and 15N,28,29,31 accurate NMR chemical shift predictions for molecules containing
these elements can be achieved.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 The Performance of the
Adopted Methods
The fitted empirical
scaling factors are listed in Table 1, and their performances are summarized in Table 2. The linear regressions
are shown in Figure 1. For all eight methods with implicit solvent models, the values
of R2 were close to 1.0 (Table 1), indicating that the applied
data are suitable for linear regression. At the same time, the deviation
of the slope from −1 indicates the existence of systematic
errors in the adopted DFT/GIAO-based calculations.26 From the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values, we can
see that all eight methods performed reasonably well. By the linear
regression, they predicted 11B chemical shifts with errors
of 3.40–3.50 and 3.37–3.50 ppm with respect to the experimental
data using the solvation model based on density (SMD) and conductor-like
polarizable continuum model (CPCM) solvent models, respectively (Table 2 and Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information). In contrast,
the corresponding errors of the results obtained without linear regression
are substantially larger (>18 ppm) (Table 2), demonstrating the effectiveness of the
fitted scaling factors in improving prediction accuracy. It is worth
noting that the boron atoms bonded with halogen atoms have a large
error, which has also been noted in 13C chemical shift
predictions and is likely due to the deficiency in the adopted DFT
method for this class of compounds.26

d Implicit solvent models (CPCM or
SMD) were included in the optimization step.

Based on the above results, it can be seen that all
of the eight
methods display comparably good performances. PBE0 and mPW1PW91 provide
similar accuracy for 11B NMR chemical shift predictions
(method 1 vs 3 and 2 vs 4). Method 5 and 7, with geometry optimization
at M062X/6-31+G(d,p) or B3LYP/cc-pVDZ in the gas phase and NMR GIAO
calculations at mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p) or B3LYP/cc-pVDZ, were proved
to be effective for not only 11B, but also for 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift predictions
as discussed before.26,28−30 In particular,
the important advantage of method 5 (with the SMD solvent model) is
that it could provide chemical shift predictions for 1H, 13C, 15N, and 11B with a consistent accuracy
in one set of calculation via the corresponding changes of the applied
solvents.27,29

For the two implicit solvent models
(SMD and CPCM), we found that
their prediction errors of 11B NMR chemical shifts are
very similar (Table 2). Moreover, we investigated the potential benefit of including the
implicit solvent models in the geometry optimization (method 5′
and 7′ in Table 2 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) in contrast to those in vacuo (method 5 and 7). Only minor changes
were observed (RMSD changes less than 0.15 ppm), indicating that the
inclusion of implicit solvent models in geometry optimization may
not improve the result significantly. Specifically, for the SMD model,
the prediction error for method 5′ increases slightly from
3.45 to 3.55 ppm, whereas the error decreases from 3.41 to 3.31 ppm
with method 7′. The result obtained with the CPCM model shows
a slight difference, where the errors for both method 5 and 7 decrease.
Considering their increased computational costs and the corresponding
gain in accuracy, we recommend to use gas phase geometry optimization
and only include the solvent model for the NMR calculation step.

2.2 Applications of 11B Chemical Shift Predictions
for
Boron–Hydrogen Compounds
We applied the developed
protocol to illustrate its possible assistance for experimental work
in the field of hydrogen storage. In recent years, because of the
high content of hydrogen,34,35 the studies of boron–hydrogen
compounds have attracted increasing interest from the community of
hydrogen storage. Nevertheless, effective identification of the intermediates
during hydrogen evolution remains a challenge. From the perspective
of the NMR analysis, merely relying on 1H NMR spectroscopy
is not sufficient.36 Combining 1H and 11B NMR spectroscopies can be a powerful strategy
in resolving the structure of boron–hydrogen compounds.

In this study, we tested 16 classical boron–hydrogen compounds
(Figure 2), for which
experimental data are available (Table 3). We conducted the NMR GIAO calculations via method
5 and 7 in vacuo following the same procedure as above. Table 3 and Figure 3 show an excellent agreement between the
predicted values and experimental data.37 For both method 5 and 7, scaling factors derived from both SMD and
CPCM models work equally well, and most of the prediction errors are
within 1.0 RMSD.

h For B3H8–, our calculations predicted two different chemical
shifts for boron atoms, and the averaged value was used to compare
with the experimental value.

The diborane, B2H6, which has two bridging
hydrogen atoms and features a ring structure (structure 2 in Figure 2), is
a highly reactive reagent that has versatile applications. As can
be seen from Figure 2, the optimized structure shows a planar ring of diborane with the
dihedral angle between Hb–B–Hb–B at 0°, matching well with the experimental measurement38,39 and previous computational work.37 The
deviations of the predicted values from the experimental data are
within 1.5 ppm. The anion B3H8– (structure 4 in Figure 2) has attracted a lot of attention due to its stability
and high content of hydrogen.40,41 This anion may adopt
different structures in solution.42 Indeed,
solution NMR studies have shown that the transformation between possible
structures can happen via the migration of hydrogen.43−45 Considering the fluxional behavior of B3H8–, we applied the same procedure by Sethio et al.37 to average the two predicted values of 11B NMR chemical shifts, and then compare the average with
experimental data. From Table 3, we found that the deviations are within 3.4 and 2.2 ppm
for method 5 and 7, respectively, which is in a reasonable agreement
with the experimental data. In contrast, Sethio et al. reported errors
∼6–9 ppm for three different DFT methods without linear
regressions.37

2.3 Applications
of 11B Chemical Shift Predictions for
Structural Elucidations of Boron Containing Molecules
We
also applied our protocol to further test some other boron containing
molecules with diverse bonding environments and investigate their
overall applicability (Figure 4). From the results listed in Table 4 and deviations shown in Figure 5, we can see that the agreement
between the predicted values and experimental data is excellent, indicating
the robustness of our protocol for structural elucidations of boron
containing molecules with different bonding features. It is worth
pointing out that, some of these experimental 11B chemical
shift values were measured in pure liquids or solvents other than
THF (Table 4). We infer
that there exists a reasonable transferability for scaling factors
among different solvents. This is consistent with our previous work
on nitrogen NMR chemical shift predictions.29

3 Methodology
3.1 Database of Boron-Containing
Molecules
There are 36
molecules and 36 chemical shifts in total included in our database
(see Table S1 in the Supporting Information for more details). The two criteria for selection of molecules include
(a) reliable experimental data available, preferably in THF;50 and (b) having relatively rigid boron skeletons.
As discussed in ref (29), the reason for the second criterion is to avoid the potential challenges
in dealing with flexible molecules when developing linear regression
models, which require Boltzmann averaging of the calculated isotropic
shielding constants on the basis of relative energies of all available
conformers. However, the developed scaling factors are expected to
be applicable for flexible molecules, provided that the relative energies
of their relevant conformers can be calculated accurately.26

3.2 Computational Details
To be consistent with the procedure
proposed by Tantillo and co-workers26,27 and our previous
study on 15N NMR chemical shifts,29 we first carried out geometry optimization in vacuo to locate the
minima on the potential energy surface. These optimized structures
were verified by vibrational frequency calculations. Second, we conducted
NMR single-point calculations in THF with both the SMD32 and CPCM33 solvent
models. It has been shown that the inclusion of the implicit solvent
model in the NMR calculation step is crucial to improve the prediction
accuracy of 1H and 13C chemical shifts.25−27 Another study by Xin et al. focusing on 13C chemical
shift predictions adopted the CPCM solvent model.30 The inclusion of the explicit solvent model may further
improve the prediction accuracy of chemical shifts,51,52 with a substantial increase of the computational cost. For consistency
with the previous studies,26−30 implicit solvent models were adopted in the current work. The GIAO
approach was applied to calculate 11B isotropic shielding
constants.24 All of the calculations were
carried out with Gaussian 09.53 The first
six levels of theory (Table 1, method 1–6) are to follow Tantillo and co-workers’
work on 1H and 13C chemical shifts26,27 and our previous study on 15N chemical shifts.29 In addition, two methods (Table 1, method 7 and 8), which have been shown
to provide accurate predictions for both 15N28 and 13C30 chemical shift calculations, were also included for comparison.
To further investigate the solvent effects, additional calculations
with an implicit solvent model included in the geometry optimization
step were carried out for two levels of theory (method 5′ and
7′).

4 Conclusions
In this
study, empirical scaling techniques for accurate prediction
of 11B NMR chemical shifts have been proposed by comparing
eight different levels of theory with two solvent models, based on
the calculated isotropic shielding constants in THF. The protocol
of 11B NMR chemical shift prediction is consistent with
the procedure proposed by Tantillo and co-workers26,27 for 1H and 13C chemical shifts and our previous
work for 15N chemical shift.29 The two sets of scaling factors for two different solvent models
(SMD and CPCM) were compared. Among the eight levels of theory, method
5 and 7 show the best performance, with geometry optimization in the
gas phase at M062X/6-31+G(d,p) or B3LYP/cc-pVDZ and NMR GIAO calculation
at mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p) or B3LYP/cc-pVDZ with an implicit solvent
model. At the same time, the effect of including solvent model in
the optimization step was also investigated. In summary, we recommend
method 5 and 7 for 11B chemical shift prediction together
with those for 1H, 13C, and 15N in
one set of calculations. For boron–hydrogen compounds or other
boron-containing molecules, the predicted 11B chemical
shifts with method 5 and 7 agree well with the experimental data,
indicating the robustness and broad applicability of this protocol
for structural elucidation. It is worth noting that the fitted scaling
factors in THF can provide a reasonable prediction for 11B chemical shifts measured in either pure liquids or in other solvents.
This is consistent with the finding of our previous research on 15N chemical shift.29 We expect
that this work on 11B chemical shift can serve as a useful
tool for elucidating or confirming the structure of boron-containing
compounds.
