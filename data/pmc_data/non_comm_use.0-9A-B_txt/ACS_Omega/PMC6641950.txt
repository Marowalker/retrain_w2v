MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
and preformed catalysts were prepared through self-propagating high-temperature
synthesis (SHS) and impregnation methods. Compared to the traditional
impregnation method, the SHS method has a shorter catalyst preparation
cycle and simpler preparation process. The characterization results
showed that mixed crystals of cerium, aluminum, and manganese oxides
were formed through the SHS method, the binding energy of Mn4+ increased, and the active components were distributed uniformly.
The MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst had an extensive pore structure,
with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of approximately
136 m2/g, a pore volume of approximately 0.17 cm3/g, and an average pore diameter of approximately 5.1 nm. Furthermore,
the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst achieved a NOx conversion higher than 80% at 100–250 °C.
Coating liquids with identical metal-ion concentrations were prepared
using the catalysts, and the preformed catalyst obtained through the
SHS method had a higher loading capacity after one coating. The MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst achieved a NOx conversion higher than 70% at 200–350 °C.

1 Introduction
In recent years, haze
has appeared frequently, and it seriously
affects the quality of people’s lives. Haze is caused by dust,
sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide. At present, industrial dust and
sulfur dioxide are well under control, but the governance of nitrogen
oxides is still a challenge. Nitrogen oxide, the main component of
atmospheric pollution, not only causes serious harm to the environment,
but also affects people’s health.1−3 Toward the control of
nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, the NH3 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) method has been studied
for many years. V2O5–WO3(MoO3)/TiO2 is the most used commercial catalytic system
for the NH3-SCR method, and its market share has reached
95%. Although V catalysts have been employed in industrial applications
for many years, they have some deficiencies, such as a narrow operation
temperature window (300–400 °C). At high temperatures,
flue gas contains a large amount of industrial dust and sulfur dioxide,
which can cause catalyst poisoning. Furthermore, the fusion and volatilization
of vanadium cause the catalyst to release poisonous gas, resulting
in secondary pollution and other issues.4 Desulfurization and denitration are difficult to achieve simultaneously
at an intermediate temperature. After dust removal and desulfurization
for catalyst protection, the temperature of the flue gas is low. Therefore,
vanadium-free NH3-SCR catalysts that operate at low temperatures
are gradually becoming a hot research topic.5−9

Mn-based catalysts have been found to be highly
effective in the
low-temperature SCR of NO with NH3, and TiO2, Al2O3, SiO2, and active carbon
have been widely used as supporters for low-temperature SCR catalysts.10−13 In many studies, CeO2 has been used to enhance SCR activity
owing to its ability to create surface and bulk oxygen vacancies by
generating Ce3+/Ce4+ redox couples.14−16 The surface and bulk oxygen vacancies can enhance the catalytic
activity in the SCR of NO with NH3 by promoting the oxidation
of NO to NO2. However, the specific surface area of CeO2 is not large enough, and its ability to create surface and
bulk oxygen vacancies needs to be improved.17 Extensive research by Dong’s group18−20 has shown that
CeO2 exhibits good catalytic performance in NO reduction
in CO model reactions. Qi et al.21 prepared
manganese–cerium oxide catalysts using a coprecipitation (CP)
method for the low-temperature SCR of NOx with ammonia in the presence of excess O2. A mechanistic
pathway for this reaction was proposed. First, NH3 is adsorbed
on the Lewis acid sites of the catalyst and then reacts with nitrite
species to produce N2 and H2O. Liu et al.22 prepared a MnOx–CeO2/t-ZrO2 catalyst via impregnation with nano-t-ZrO2 as the support. It showed good catalytic activity in the
low-temperature SCR of NO with NH3. The catalyst had excellent
redox ability on the surface, which predominantly featured Lewis acid
sites.

Catalyst cost is a significant aspect of denitration
technology
in industrial applications. Therefore, many studies have attempted
to simplify the preparation processes of catalyst powders and shorten
the catalyst preparation cycle to reduce the cost. Using a citric
acid-based method, Baiker et al.23 prepared
a manganese–cerium mixed oxide catalyst, which showed superior
catalytic activity to those of pure manganese oxides and cerium oxides.
Yang et al.24 loaded Mn–Ce–Ox catalysts on TiO2 carbonaceous materials
using a sol–gel method. A de-NOx efficiency higher than 90% was achieved with a Mn–Ce–Ox/TiO2-carbon nanotube catalyst at
75–225 °C and a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 36 000
h–1. The de-NOx efficiency
increased to 99.6% upon adding 250 ppm SO2 at 100–250
°C. Liu et al.25 prepared a series
of Mn–Ce mixed oxide catalysts using the surfactant-template
(ST) and conventional coprecipitation (CP) methods. The best Mn–Ce
mixed oxide catalyst prepared by the ST method achieved nearly 100%
NOx conversion at 100–200 °C.
Moreover, it showed stronger resistance to H2O and SO2. Liu et al.26 also prepared a
Mn–Ce–Ti mixed oxide catalyst using the hydrothermal
method. This catalyst exhibited excellent NH3-SCR activity
and strong resistance to H2O and SO2 with a
broad operation temperature window for diesel engines. Smirniotis’
group27 prepared Mn/TiO2 and
a series of Mn–Ni/TiO2 catalysts using the incipient
wetness technique. For the nickel-doped Mn/TiO2 catalysts,
the low-temperature reduction peak was shifted to much lower temperatures.
This increase in reducibility and the extremely dominant MnO2 phase seem to be the reasons for the high SCR activity of the Mn–Ni/TiO2 catalysts.

The self-propagating high-temperature synthesis
(SHS) method is
highly regarded and respected in the fields of composite materials
and synthetic polymers because of its simple procedure, low energy
consumption, and high conversion rate.28,29 Roy et al.30 showed that catalysts prepared by the SHS method
have excellent nanostructures and exhibit excellent performances.
The SHS method also provides a new direction for SCR catalyst preparation.
Peng et al.31 prepared a series of bulk
MnWOx and supported MnWOx/TiO2 catalysts with MnWO4 structures
via the SHS, CP, and impregnation methods. They found that Mn2WOx/TiO2 prepared by
the SHS method showed the best de-NOx performance.

In this study, we prepared a MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst using
the SHS method and compared it with a catalyst obtained by the traditional
impregnation method. Cerium oxide and manganese oxide were the active
components so that the disadvantages associated with vanadium in the
catalytic process could be avoided. An analogue flue gas composed
of NO, O2, NH3, and N2 was used to
study the catalytic performance of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
catalyst at low temperature. The obtained samples were studied systematically
using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and H2 temperature-programmed reduction
(TPR). Furthermore, a MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst was
prepared using the SHS method. Its catalytic performance at different
temperatures was evaluated and compared to that of a preformed catalyst
prepared using the impregnation method. The effects of H2O and SO2 on NO conversion over the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst were also studied.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
2.1.1 Impregnation
Method
For the preparation
of a CeO2–Al2O3 composite
oxide carrier, the requisite quantities of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O as the Ce source and Al(NO3)3·9H2O as the Al source were dissolved
in distilled water and stirred for 2 h. “CeO2–Al2O3” indicates that the Ce/Al molar ratio
is 1:2. Then, excess ammonia (30%) was added slowly with vigorous
stirring until the pH was 10. The resulting solution was stirred for
another 6 h, aged for 24 h, and then filtered and washed several times
with distilled water until there was no pH change (pH = 7). The obtained
cake was oven-dried at 110 °C for 12 h and finally calcined at
550 °C in air for 5 h. Mn(CH3COO)2 was
used as the Mn source to load 18 wt % Mn on the CeO2–Al2O3 composite oxide carrier. The MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst was prepared using the wetness impregnation method
with a Mn(CH3COO)2 solution. The mixture was
stirred for 2 h and then evaporated at 100 °C in an oil bath.
The resulting material was dried at 110 °C for 12 h in an oven
and then calcined at 450 °C in air for 5 h. The obtained catalyst
will be referred to as the powdered catalyst; its Mn/Ce/Al molar ratio
was 1:1:2. Figure 1a shows a diagram of the catalyst preparation.

the preparations of MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 (a)
powdered and (b) preformed catalysts using the impregnation method
and the syntheses of MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 (c) powdered and (d) preformed
catalysts using the self-propagating high-temperature synthesis method.

For the preparation of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst, the
requisite quantities of ethylene glycol and citric acid were added
to water (n(H2O)/n(citric
acid)/n(ethylene glycol) = 15:1.5:1) and then the
solution was heated at 80 °C for 2 h, affording a sticky transparent
liquid. Then, a certain amount of MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst
was added to the sticky transparent liquid and the resulting mixture
was stirred for 2 h, affording a 40 wt % catalyst slurry. A cordierite
honeycomb (CHC) carrier was immersed in the catalyst slurry and then
a compressor was used to generate holes. The resulting material was
calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. The obtained catalyst will
be referred to as the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst. Figure 1b shows a diagram
of the catalyst preparation. It could take about 5 days to complete
the whole preparation process via coprecipitation method and impregnation
method.

2.1.2 Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis
Like the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst, the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst had a Mn/Ce/Al molar ratio of 1:1:2. The requisite
quantities of Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O, Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in distilled
water separately to obtain metal precursor solutions. The above three
solutions were mixed and then 5 wt % urea was added. The resulting
mixture was stirred for 1 h to afford what will be referred to as
the combustion liquid of the catalyst. The resulting solution was
placed in a ceramic crucible, heated slowly to 300 °C in air
(about 5 °C/min), and kept at that temperature for 1 h. Finally,
the remaining material was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h. The obtained
catalyst will be referred to as the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
catalyst. Figure 1c
shows a diagram of the catalyst preparation.

For the preparation
of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst, a combustion liquid of the
catalyst was prepared using the above method; its metal-ion concentration
was the same as that used for the catalyst prepared with the impregnation
method. A cordierite honeycomb carrier was immersed in the catalyst
slurry and then a compressor was used to generate holes. The resulting
material was calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. The obtained
catalyst will be referred to as the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed
catalyst. Figure 1d
shows a diagram of the catalyst preparation. It could take about half
a day to prepare MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst via the SHS
method..

2.2 Catalyst Characterization
To investigate
the crystalline structures of the obtained catalysts, powder XRD was
conducted using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation (k = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA,
with a 2θ scanning range of 10–90°. XPS was conducted
with a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer using a monochromatized Al
Kα X-ray source (225 W) with a minimum energy resolution of
0.45 eV (Ag 3d5/2) and a minimum XPS analysis area diameter
of 3 μm. To eliminate the interference associated with surface
carbon contamination, the C 1s peak energy was defined as 284.6 eV.
The microstructural surface characteristics, including the specific
surface areas and pore volumes of the samples, were determined using
an ASAP 2020C surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument
Corporation). First, the samples were degassed for 6 h at 200 °C
and then analyzed using N2 adsorption–desorption
at −196 °C under a liquid nitrogen environment. SEM was
conducted using an S-4800 field-emission microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies
Corp., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 0.5–30 kV. TPR
experiments were conducted with an AutoChem 2720 catalyst characterization
system (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). The catalysts were
pretreated by passing high-purity N2 (40 mL/min) through
the system at 100 °C for 20 min and then cooled to room temperature.
The samples were subsequently heated from 50 to 900 °C at 10
°C/min and 10% H2–Ar (40 mL/min) was passed
through the system.

2.3 Catalytic Performance Tests
A microstructured
fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate the catalytic performances
of the powdered catalysts in the NH3-SCR reaction in the
laboratory. Figure 2 shows a schematic illustrating the catalytic performance evaluation
device employed in the experiments. The reaction tube was custom-manufactured
with a cross-sectional area of 0.78 cm2. The simulated
flue gas was composed of 40% NO (1277 ppm), 40% NH3 (1268
ppm), and 5% O2 with N2 as the volume diluent,
and the total volume flow was 100 mL/min. The initial NO content of
the simulated flue gas was therefore 500 ppm, which will be referred
to as C0. In the tests, a catalyst sample
was placed in the reaction tube and its SCR reaction performance was
evaluated at different temperatures under flowing simulated flue gas
after a 30 min initialization period. The performance was evaluated
every 50 °C between 50 and 400 °C, and the measured NOx content will be referred to as C1 (NOx content = NO content
+ NO2 content). The NOx conversion
was calculated as follows  The N2 selectivities were calculated
according to the input concentrations of NOx and NH3 and the output concentrations of N2O, NO2, NOx, and NH3 as follows  The catalytic performances of
the preformed
catalysts were evaluated using another microstructured fixed-bed reactor,
whose schematic is shown in Figure 3. The reaction tube was custom-manufactured with a
cross-sectional area of 19.625 cm2. The simulated flue
gas was composed of 500 ppm NO and 500 ppm NH3 with air
as the volume diluent, and the total volume flow was 10 L/min. In
the tests, a catalyst sample was placed in the reaction tube, and
its SCR reaction performance was evaluated at different temperatures
under flowing simulated flue gas after a 2 h initialization period.
The NOx conversion was calculated using
the same equation as that used for the powdered catalysts.

The coating of the preformed catalysts
was evaluated through the
shock removal rates. The preformed catalysts were weighed (m0) and then submerged completely in water in
a beaker. Then, they were ultrasonicated at 30 MHz for 30 min. The
resulting material was dried at 130 °C for 12 h and then weighed
(m1). The shock removal rate was calculated
as follows  

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Crystalline Structure Analysis
of the Powdered
Catalysts
Figure 4 displays the XRD patterns of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts. In the diffraction line profile
of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst, the diffraction peaks at
28.5, 33.0, 47.4, 56.3, 59.1, 69.4, 76.7, 79.0, and 88.4° were
attributed to CeO2. The diffraction peaks of MnOx were complex. The peaks at 28.6, 37.4, and
56.7° were attributed to MnO2, those at 33.1 and 55.3°
were attributed to Mn2O3, and those at 18.0
and 59.8° were attributed to Mn3O4.32,33 In addition, no crystal Al2O3 was observed
because the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 probably overlapped with the broadened XRD peaks.34,35 The diffraction peaks of CeO2 and MnOx of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst were
shifted to lower angles compared to those of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
catalyst or were absent. Two reasons account for this phenomenon.
First, MnOx, Al2O3, and CeO2 simultaneously formed composite oxides when
the SHS method was used. During this process, Mn and Al were inserted
into the CeO2 grid and formed a solid solution, causing
the characteristic MnO2 and Al2O3 diffraction peaks to weaken or even disappear.36,37 Furthermore, Mn and Al formed oxides with final crystal types that
the instrument could not detect.38 In addition,
the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst had highly dispersed active
components and smaller particles than the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst.

Figure 4 XRD patterns
of MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
catalysts.

To investigate their elementary
oxidation states and surface compositions,
XPS was conducted on the synthesized MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts, and the results are displayed in Figure 5. Their respective
binding energies are listed in Table 1. In addition, the peaks were numerically fitted using
Gaussian components to determine the respective valence states of
the elemental components. The corresponding atomic concentrations
of the different elements on the surfaces of the catalysts based on
this fitting are listed in Table 2.

The Mn 2p spectra of these representative samples were numerically
fitted with two components, as shown in Figure 5a. The binding energies of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 of MnOx were
approximately 641 and 653 eV, respectively.39 The binding energies of Mn 2p3/2 were 641.8 and 641.2
eV, suggesting that Mn4+ was the main valence state of
Mn in these catalysts. Interestingly, the Mn 2p3/2 peak
of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst appeared at a higher binding
energy compared to the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst because MnOx and CeO2 formed composite oxides
simultaneously when the SHS method was used, leading to the higher
Mn4+ binding energies.40Table 2 shows that the two
samples have similar Mn contents, but the Mn4+/Mn ratio
of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst was clearly higher than that
of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst. This indicates that there
was synergism between Ce and Mn in the composite metal oxide because
Ce can provide oxygen to Mn to increase the valence state and enhance
the oxidation ability of Mn and that the activity of the SCR reaction
was improved.41

The complex Ce 3d
spectra for these samples were decomposed into
eight components, and the assignments are shown in Figure 5b. According to the literature,
the bands labeled u′ and v′ represent the 3d104f1 initial electronic state corresponding to Ce3+, whereas the other six bands labeled u‴ and v‴, u″
and v″, and u0 and v0 were related to
Ce4+.42−44 The peaks of Ce3+ are weak because electrons
are transferred from Ce3+ to O/Mn during the formation
of solid oxides.45 From Table 2, the ratio of Ce3+ on MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst was much higher than that on MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 catalyst, which was calculated by Ce3+/Ce. The
number of surface oxygen vacancies increased because of the higher
relative ratio of Ce3+, which promoted the adsorption of
activate reactants or intermediate species in SCR reaction during
100–200 °C.41 At the same time,
the previous reports demonstrated negative charge transfer from either
Mn to Ce or Ce to Mn.9 The charge transfer
would lead to the strong interaction between Ce and Mn. The Mn4+ and Ce3+ could absorb and activate NO and O2; thus, the cations of Mn4+ and Ce3+ could serve as active sites to promote the loss of an electron from
NO and the capture of an O– ion to generate NO2.26

Al2O3 played a supporting role in the oxide
formation, providing a large number of active sites for the active
components, MnOx and CeO2.
The Al 2p spectra of these representative samples were numerically
fitted with two characteristic peaks, as shown in Figure 5c. The binding energies of
Al 2p3/2 and Al 2p1/2 were 70–78 and
78–85 eV, respectively.35 The peak
of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst was wider than that of the
MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst, but the peak height was slightly
lower because MnOx, Al2O3, and CeO2 formed composite oxides simultaneously
when the SHS method was used, decreasing the binding energies of Al3+.

The XPS images for the O 1s ionization features of
these samples
are numerically fitted with two components, and are presented in Figure 5d. Both of the catalysts
gave a primary O″ band at 515–527 eV attributed to the
bonding of lattice oxygen (Olatt) to the metal cations
and an O′ band at 527–538 eV attributed to chemisorbed
oxygen or/and oxygen from surface hydroxyls and adsorbed water.46 This is consistent with the literature,47 which has also revealed that the O′ peak
is composed of three peaks, denoted as Olatt, Oads, and Osurf, attributed to bonding with the metal cations,
chemisorbed oxygen, and surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water,
respectively. From Table 1, we noted that the differences between the binding energies
of the three O 1s components of the O′ peak are quite small.
In addition, Table 2 shows that the relative concentration ratios Osurf/(Osurf + Olatt + Oads) of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts were approximately
31.5 and 28.5%, respectively. In some studies, Oads was
defined as the active oxygen, which captured free electrons easily.
Therefore, Oads may promote the oxidation of NO to NO2,48 as does a high Osurf/(Osurf + Olatt + Oads) ratio, and
facilitate the “fast SCR” reaction because the presence
of NO2 in the gas mixture is beneficial to the SCR reaction
over the catalysts.49,50 Moreover, the active oxygen originated
from either the free oxygen in the simulated flue gas or the chemisorbed
oxygen on the surface. Therefore, increasing the Oads content
on the surface may have positive effects on the SCR reaction.45

3.2 Microstructures of the
Powdered Catalysts
SEM images of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and
MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
catalysts are shown in Figure 6. These images show that the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst
particles were well distributed, and coarse granular protuberances,
ravines, and a large number of widely distributed pores existed on
the surface, as shown in Figure 6a. The MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst showed
a folded shape and a lamellar structure with a smooth surface, as
shown in Figure 6c.
However, the lamellar structure was thin and small enough to ensure
a large specific surface area. The pictures with 5000× magnification
(Figure 6b,d) show
that a large number of pores were distributed in the cross section
of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst, which ensures that the catalyst
has an ideal specific surface area. The following mechanism can be
proposed for the reaction in the SHS method. After the combustion
liquid of the catalyst is placed in a ceramic crucible and the moisture
is evaporated, it gradually becomes a sticky colloidal solution. At
the same time, a large number of air bubbles are produced and the
gel swells, eventually becoming lighter and spreading out. Just before
the water is removed completely, the air temperature is higher than
that of the crucible. When the ignition point of urea is reached,
the SHS reaction begins from the surface of the liquid. The solid
does not deform easily, and the liquid expands outward, spreading
the pore structure of the formed layer.

MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and (c, d) MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts.

Figure 7 shows the
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm plots and the
corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size
distribution curves of these samples. Figure 7a shows that both samples were classical
type IV, as defined by IUPAC,51 and this
is the characteristic of mesoporous materials owing to the textural
interparticle mesoporosity. A well-defined H2-type hysteresis
loop with a sloping adsorption branch and a relatively steep desorption
branch was observed at the high relative pressure range (p/p0) for both samples. This H2-type hysteresis loop is typical for wormhole-like mesostructures
and intrinsic mesoporous structures formed through nanoparticle assembly.52,53 Furthermore, the pore size distribution curves of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts obtained using
the BJH method from the adsorption branches of the corresponding isotherms
exhibit a narrow peak centered at 2–8 and 10–30 nm,
respectively. The textural data of these samples are listed in Table 3. The CeAl2 composite oxide carrier was doped with Mn2+, leading
to a reduction in the specific surface area of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst.16,54 The SEM images showed that coarse
granular protuberances, ravines, and a large number of widely distributed
pores existed on the surface of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst,
but the two samples had similar average pore diameters and pore volumes.
The images also suggest that the interior of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst have many pores.

3.3 Reduction Performance of the Powdered Catalysts
The
reduction properties of these samples were evaluated using
H2-TPR, and the results are shown in Figure 8. The reduction peak of MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
catalysts could be divided into three component peaks by fitting with
Gaussian curves at around 329, 421, and 545 °C attributed to
Mn2O3 → Mn3O4,
Mn3O4 → MnO,55 and Ce4+ → Ce3+,56 respectively. Interestingly, the reduction peak of the
MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst was a strong peak at 419 °C.
This suggested that the interaction between CeO2, MnOx, and Al2O3 could activate
the reduction ability of MnOx. Furthermore,
the reduction curves of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts were significantly different. They revealed that
at the same temperature the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst consumed
more H2 than did the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst and
was reduced more. The strong reduction performance proved that the
catalyst surface contained many active sites.57 It has been reported in the literature that the specific surface
area of the catalyst, porosity, and other physical factors may affect
MnOx reduction properties.58−60

3.4 Catalytic
Performances of the Powdered Catalysts
The activities of
the powdered catalysts at a GHSV of 15 384
h–1 are shown in Figure 9a. We noted that the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst achieved a NOx conversion
of 60% at 50 °C, whereas that achieved by MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 was
only 34%. When the reaction temperature was increased from 50 to 200
°C, the NOx conversions increased
gradually for both powdered catalysts. For both samples, the NOx conversion reached a maximum at 200–250
°C. This suggested that the Mn–Ce–Al catalysts
prepared using the two methods had similar catalytic behaviors at
low temperatures. The NOx conversion curve
showed that the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst displayed better
catalytic performance below 250 °C. As the temperature increased,
the NOx conversion for both powdered catalysts
decreased. However, the NOx conversion
decreased significantly more slowly for MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3, which indicated
that the Mn–Ce–Al catalyst prepared using the impregnation
method showed good catalytic performance at high temperatures. The
operation temperature window, in which the NOx conversion is greater than 80%, was 100–250 °C for the
MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst. This operation temperature
window was 225–320 °C for the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst.
From Figure 9b, we
noted that the N2 selectivity of both MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and
MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst was stable and higher than
90% at below 150 °C and decreased sharply when the reaction temperature
was above 150 °C. However, at reaction temperatures above 300
°C, the decrease rate of the N2 selectivity decreased
as the temperature increased and showed a tendency to increase for
some catalysts.

Figure 9 (a) Catalytic activity and (b) N2 selectivity
of the
MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalysts.

Before the SCR reaction began, the analogue flue gas contained
no N2O or NO2. However, the postreaction gases
included numerous byproducts, and their concentrations increased with
increasing temperature. From Figure 10a, we noted that the concentration of N2O increased rapidly, reached a peak value at 300 °C for the
MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst, and then decreased at above
300 °C. For the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst, the concentration
of N2O became constant at above 200 °C. The NO could
be reacted with NH3 to form N2O due to the Eley–Rideal
mechanism below 200 °C. With increasing temperature, intermediate
NH4NO3 was easily formed and decomposed to N2O and H2O due to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism.21,61

Figure 10 Concentrations of N2O and
NO2 after the SCR
reaction.

From Figure 10b,
we noted that NO was oxidized directly to NO2 despite the
presence of NH3, owing to the presence of O2 in the analogue flue gas. When the reaction temperature was below
250 °C, the concentration of NO2 was very low and
fluctuated slightly for the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst. However,
when the reaction temperature was 250 °C or higher, the NO2 concentration increased sharply and reached a peak value
at 350 °C. In contrast, the concentration of NO2 for
the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst remained low at below 300
°C and then increased. Along with this trend, we noted from Figure 9b that the N2 selectivity decreased accordingly because of the high concentration
of byproducts. This suggests that the concentration of NH3 was suitable for the reduction 2NH3 + NO + NO2 → 2N2 + 3H2O at high temperatures.

3.5 Microstructures of the Preformed Catalysts
Figure 11 shows
the SEM images of the Mn–Ce–Al preformed catalysts.
The SEM image in Figure 11a shows that there is an obvious interface between the cordierite
honeycomb (CHC) carrier and the catalyst coating and that the catalyst
coating and CHC carrier are closely linked with the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst. In addition, the dense coating featured a number
of pores, and a large number of granular protuberances existed on
the surface of the catalyst coating, which increased the specific
surface area of the preformed catalyst. The thickness of the catalyst
coating was approximately 30 μm, whereas the thickness of the
entire catalyst was 50 μm. For the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed
catalyst, the SHS reaction occurred in the CHC carrier material; it
was difficult to find the interface between the CHC carrier and the
catalyst coating because the CHC carrier absorbed liquid. The catalyst
coating was dense with well-developed porosity, and the coating surface
featured a thin layer with a large amount of flakes. The thickness
of the catalyst coating was approximately 25 μm. The shock removal
rates of the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalysts were
2.5 and 0.5%, respectively. This suggested that the catalyst coating
containing the catalyst prepared using the SHS method had stronger
adhesion.

3.6 Catalytic Performances of the Preformed Catalysts
Catalyst coating liquids with identical metal-ion concentrations
of 2.65 mol/L were prepared. After one coating of the catalysts prepared
using the SHS and impregnation methods was applied to the CHC carrier,
the loading capacities of the resulting preformed catalysts were approximately
18 and 13%, respectively. The activities of the preformed catalysts
at a GHSV of 4076 h–1 are shown in Figure 12. For the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst, the NOx conversion
increased gradually as the reaction temperature was increased from
50 to 250 °C and reached 82% at 250 °C. When the reaction
temperature was increased further, the NOx conversion decreased gradually. The operation temperature window,
in which the NOx conversion is higher
than 70%, was 200–350 °C. For the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 preformed
catalyst, the highest NOx conversion,
approximately 70%, was achieved at 300 °C. This suggested that
NOx conversion is related to the loading
capacity and that the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst showed
better de-NOx performance. The volume
of the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalyst was adjusted, the NOx conversions under different space velocities
were evaluated, and the results are displayed in Figure 13. When the space velocity
was increased, the NOx conversion decreased
gradually, and the de-NOx behavior was
similar to that as the temperature was increased.

the MnOx/CeO2–Al2O3 and MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalysts.

4 Conclusions
The present work was a comparative study on the influences of the
structures, textures, reduction properties, and the catalytic performances
of Mn–Ce–Al catalysts prepared using the SHS and impregnation
methods in NOx reduction by NH3. On the basis of the experimental and characterization results,
the following several conclusions were obtained:(1) The MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered
and preformed catalysts showed good performances in the NH3-SCR of NOx. The MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst achieved a NOx conversion
higher than 80% at 100–250 °C. Coating liquids with identical
metal-ion concentrations were prepared with the catalysts, and the
preformed catalyst obtained using the SHS method had a higher loading
capacity after the first coating. For the MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed
catalyst, the NOx conversion was higher
than 70% at 200–350 °C.

(2) The characterization results showed
that mixed crystals of cerium, aluminum, and manganese oxides were
formed through the SHS method, the binding energy of Mn4+ increased, and the active components were distributed uniformly.
The MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 powdered catalyst had an extensive pore structure,
with a BET surface area of approximately 136 m2/g, pore
volume of approximately 0.17 cm3/g, and average pore diameter
of approximately 5.1 nm. In addition, the catalyst coating obtained
using the SHS method had stronger adhesion.

(3) The SHS method involves a simpler
catalyst preparation process and shorter preparation cycle; the synthesis
period is only 6 h. This suggests that the SHS method is applicable
to the industrial manufacture of MnOx–CeO2–Al2O3 preformed catalysts.
