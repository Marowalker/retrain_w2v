Poly(triazine imide) (PTI) is a material
belonging to the group
of carbon nitrides and has shown to have competitive properties compared
to melon or g-C3N4, especially in photocatalysis.
As most of the carbon nitrides, PTI is usually synthesized by thermal
or hydrothermal approaches. We present and discuss an alternative
synthesis for PTI which exhibits a pH-dependent solubility in aqueous
solutions. This synthesis is based on the formation of radicals during
electrolysis of an aqueous melamine solution, coupling of resulting
melamine radicals and the final formation of PTI. We applied different
characterization techniques to identify PTI as the product of this
reaction and report the first liquid state NMR experiments on a triazine-based
carbon nitride. We show that PTI has a relatively high specific surface
area and a pH-dependent adsorption of charged molecules. This tunable
adsorption has a significant influence on the photocatalytic properties
of PTI, which we investigated in dye degradation experiments.

Introduction
Carbon nitrides have
emerged as a new class of semiconducting materials
with a large variety of possible applications. Because photocatalytic
water splitting has been reported for these compounds in 2009,1 most of them were prepared by thermal or hydrothermal
synthesis leading in the formation of melon2,3 (often
referred as g-C3N4),4−9 poly melamine,10,11 poly(heptazine imide),12,13 or poly(triazine imide) (PTI).14−18 Kessler et al. discuss in their review the differences
of these structures and their promising properties, especially in
photocatalysis.19 In the literature, it
was shown that carbon nitrides are capable of reducing carbon dioxide,20−25 splitting water,1,20,26−29 degrading organic pollutants such as dyes6,12,22,30−32 under illumination in the visible range, as well as having a high
sensitivity in sensing applications,31,33−37 and catalyzing organic reactions.38−42

Different approaches have been used to improve
the photocatalytic
properties of these carbon nitrides. Ong et al. give a good overview
over the so-far published carbon nitrides and their modifications.43 By elemental doping,44−47 copolymerization,48,49 templating,50,51 or forming composites especially
with nanocrystals,52−57 it was possible to further extend the number of applications in
photocatalysis, and even dark photocatalysis has been reported recently
by Lau et al.58 Being restricted to thermal
and hydrothermal synthesis limits the variety in the above mentioned
approaches. Therefore, it is important to discuss alternative strategies
for the synthesis to further improve the properties of carbon nitrides.

In 2015, Lu et al. reported the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride
nanosheets using a new electrochemical approach and showed the peroxidase-like
activity of those nanosheets.59 In a new
experimental setup with differences in the subsequent washing procedure,
we were able to obtain a carbon nitride material either in solution
[aqueous sodium hydroxide solution at pH 13 and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)] or as suspension (water at neutral pH) that can be freeze-dried,
yielding the powdery product. We applied different techniques in solid
state, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and also
liquid-state techniques such as two-dimensional 1H–15N NMR spectroscopy to identify the product of the synthesis
as PTI. Reasonable yields could be achieved, and the as-described
synthesis is facile and safe compared to molten salt synthesis, which
were conducted under high pressure.14−18 Besides the thorough characterization, we were able
to demonstrate and investigate PTI adsorption behavior for charged
molecules by the examples of naphthol yellow S (NYS) (anionic) and
methylene blue (MB) (cationic). Additionally, we demonstrated its
capability in photocatalytic dye degradation of MB, and we further
investigated the active species in these processes.

Results and Discussion
The as-prepared product is proposed to be PTI. A schematic of the
molecular structure is shown in Figure 1a. In the following passages, different characterization
methods are combined to confirm this hypothesis. In general, the yellowish-brown
product can be obtained in solution or in suspension, depending on
the amount of sodium hydroxide in the synthesis. Figure 1b shows PTI in aqueous solutions
at different pH values. The Tyndall effect describes the scattering
of an incident beam by small particles. Therefore, the beam is observable
not only in the direction of propagation but also at different observation
angles. The absence of this effect at pH 13 indicates the formation
of a solution, whereas at pH 1 and pH 7 a suspension is formed. Even
after being synthesized and washed, PTI can be either dissolved in
aqueous solution because of the formation of the PTI anion as well
as being again precipitated by protonation. We assume that the imide
group can be deprotonated by the addition of a base, for example,
sodium hydroxide. The deprotonated and negatively charged PTI can
be processed and analyzed in solution, which opens the possibility
of a wide range of characterization techniques, for example, liquid-state
NMR spectroscopy. The addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid
results in the precipitation of PTI. This process does not change
the observed properties of PTI. Besides, Miller et al. recently described
the spontaneous dissolution of PTI in DMSO.60 We were able to reproduce these results and observed a solubility
of PTI at room temperature of 9.1 mg/mL and 10.2 mg/mL in DMSO and
sodium hydroxide solution at pH 13, respectively. The solubility was
determined by preparing a saturated solution of PTI in each of the
solvents, filtering the supernatant with a syringe filter followed
by the evaluation of the mass of PTI in a defined volume.

a single plane of PTI and its unit cell (red) (a).

pH 1, and pH 7) (b). At pH 1 and pH 7, a nonstable suspension is obtained,
while at pH 13 a solution is formed (top). The lower image shows the
Tyndall effect at pH 1 and pH 7. At pH 13, the Tyndall effect cannot
be observed (bottom).

Lu et al. described the formation process of their graphitic
carbon
nitride as a coupling of oxidized melamine radicals.59 These radicals were formed by the reaction of melamine
with radical species emerging during the electrolysis of water, namely
hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. These radicals are in situ formed
at voltages exceeding the standard potentials for electrolysis of
water of 1.23 V plus the overpotential. A similar approach has been
described for carbon nanostructures prepared using electrochemical
exfoliation by Lu et al.61 It can be observed
that the colorless solution of melamine in water turns yellowish during
the reaction. We noticed that this change of color takes place at
the anode, which leads us to the assumption that radicals, which are
evolving during the oxidation of water, may be the main reactive species
in this reaction. To further prove that assumption, we studied the
formation of hydroxyl radicals. To do so, terephthalic acid was dissolved
in 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The acid has been added next to
the anode. Aliquots were taken after certain time intervals. The formation
of 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid was observed by detecting the emission
at 425 nm. The emission spectra are shown in Figure S2. The influence of the as-formed hydroxyl radicals was proven
through conducting the regular experiment in the presence of terephthalic
acid. It was observed that the color change appears later, and less
PTI is yielded.

Characterization
In the following section, different
methods are combined to identify PTI as the product of the above described
reaction and its physical properties are discussed.

To determine
the morphology of PTI, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were evaluated (Figure 2). Porous networks
of PTI which are composed of loose ribbonlike fragments can be observed.
These fragments are up to 500 nm long and up to 80 nm wide. In selected
area electron diffraction, only broad rings with low intensity can
be observed in very dense areas. Therefore, we assume that these PTI
ribbons have small crystalline domains and are not single crystalline.
The significant porosity of the networks is confirmed by the specific
surface of 96 m2 g–1 found by multipoint
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherm analysis (adsorption/desorption
isotherms as well as a multipoint BET fit are shown in Figure S3) and is relatively high compared to
that of other carbon nitride materials.20,22,29

Figure 2 SEM and TEM images of the obtained PTI. The ribbonlike
fragments
arrange in loose networks with a high porosity. The scale bars in
the SEM and TEM images are 500 and 100 nm, respectively.

When PTI is dissolved in DMSO, a change in the
morphology is observed.
The SEM and TEM images are shown in Figure S4. The obtained structures exhibit a two-dimensional morphology.

Despite the above-mentioned small domain sizes, two characteristic
reflexes can be observed in powder XRD of the as-obtained product.
The reflex at 27.66° is related to the (002) stacking of conjugated
aromatic systems. The calculated interlayer distance is found to be
3.22 Å. The values for tri-s-triazine based
carbon nitride are 27.4° and 3.26 Å.1 The less intense reflex at 10.6° is labeled as (100) and is
defined by the distance of 8.33 Å. This distance is found in
the repeating unit in plane, more precisely in the periodicity of
the pores formed by the s-triazine subunits. The
shift in the reflex of the s-triazine based carbon
nitride compared to the tri-s-triazine based carbon
nitride (13.0° and 6.81 Å)1 is
clearly observable and is explained through the smaller unit cell
of the latter. Figure 3a shows the XRD pattern of the proposed s-triazine
based structure shown in Figure 1. The distance of 8.33 Å shows a slight shift
compared to values found for PTIs with intercalated metal ions synthesized
using hydrothermal approaches.15,62,63 The broadening of the reflexes indicates small crystal sizes. Using
the Scherrer equation, a crystal size of around 9 nm is found for
the analysis of the (100) reflex. The crystal size found for the reflex
(002) at 27.66 Å is 14 nm. We explain the absence of higher-order
reflexes by the size of the crystals, which is low compared to PTI
prepared by molten salt synthesis. Wirnhier et al. report sizes of
up to 60 nm.14

Figure 3 XRD pattern of PTI shows
two characteristic reflexes at 10.6°
and 27.66°, which are related to an in-plane periodicity (100)
and interlayer stacking (002), respectively (a). FTIR spectrum of
PTI recorded between 500 and 4000 cm–1. The spectrum
shows characteristic absorptions at 775 cm–1, between
1100 and 1700 cm–1, especially at 1260 cm–1, and around 3130 cm–1 and 3330 cm–1 (b). 1H, 15N HMBC NMR spectrum of PTI in DMSO.
Signals are observed at −212.2, −249.5, and −296.4
ppm with respect to nitromethane. These signals can be assigned to
the central ring nitrogen and the bridging imide and amine nitrogen,
respectively (c). 13C NMR spectrum of PTI in DMSO. Signals
are observed between 166.7 and 171.5 ppm. These peaks can be assigned
to the carbon atoms in triazine and heptazine rings (d,e).

To confirm our hypothesis, the elemental composition
was evaluated
through combustion (carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen) and pyrolysis
analysis (oxygen). The determined values are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Amounts of Carbon, Nitrogen, Hydrogen,
and Oxygen Found in the Sample by Combustion and Pyrolysis Analysis
 	C mass % (atomic %)	N mass % (atomic %)	H mass % (atomic %)	O mass % (atomic %)	
combustion analysis	26.11 (20.84)	47.79 (32.71)	3.67 (34.91)	 	
pyrolysis analysis	 	 	 	19.27 (11.54)	
For an integer amount of carbon,
a sum formula of C3N4.7O1.7H5 is calculated. These
values are in good agreement with the values of C3N4.5H1.5 given for the unit cell of PTI defined in Figure 1a. The nonconformity
of the values found for hydrogen and oxygen can be explained by adsorbed
water and for hydrogen by primary amine groups at the border of the
structures or vacancies. A significant amount of oxygen can also be
found in functional groups proven using FTIR and XPS measurements.

Figure 3b shows
the FTIR spectrum of the product. There are multiple bands, which
can be assigned to different absorptions which are characteristic
for carbon nitrides in general. The sharp peak at 775 cm–1 can be ascribed to the out-of-plane bending mode of either triazine
or heptazine rings. The fingerprint region between 1100 and 1700 cm–1 shows various absorption maxima for imide and nitride
stretching vibrations. Around 1260 cm–1, the characteristic
band for the C–NH–C unit is found. The bands around
2170, 1720, and 1180 cm–1 indicate the presence
of nitrile- or oxygen-containing functional groups such as C=O
or C–OH. The bands at 3330 and 3130 cm–1 are
related to NH-stretching vibrations.14,15 To further
confirm PTI as the product of the as-described synthesis, NMR and
XPS experiments were conducted.

NMR spectroscopy is a powerful
tool to identify the chemical structure
of PTI and to exclude a heptazine-based structure. Up to now, most
carbon nitrides were analyzed by solid state MAS-NMR spectroscopy2,14,48,59,63 because of the vanishing solubility of carbon
nitrides in common solvents. Unfortunately, compared to liquid-state
NMR spectroscopy, this method is time-consuming and lacks resolution.
For polymeric carbon nitride (melon), a heptazine-based carbon nitride,
NMR spectra have been recorded in concentrated sulfuric acid.64

The 13C NMR spectrum of PTI
shown in Figure 3d,e
is defined by several signals
distributed in the region between 166.7 and 171.5 ppm. Signals in
that region are typically observed for both triazine- and heptazine-based
carbon nitride materials.2,14,48,59,63 Therefore, the 15N NMR spectrum is needed to assign the
observed 13C NMR signals to the triazine-based PTI. The
carbon atoms in the triazine ring are located next to imide groups
as well as primary and secondary amine groups. Also, nitrile- or oxygen-containing
functional groups are observed in FTIR and XPS spectra and contribute
to the shown NMR spectrum by slight shifts in this region. Figure S5a shows the solid state CPMAS 13C NMR spectrum of PTI. It consists of two broad signals at 165.5
and 157.2 ppm. The observed shifts result by the stacking of the PTI
planes in solid state. Also, solvent interaction has to be reconsidered.
The 15N NMR spectrum of PTI was collected in a heteronuclear
multiband correlation experiment (Figure 3c). It consists of three signals at −212.4,
−249.5, and −296.8 ppm. The first signal is assigned
to the tertiary nitrogen atom in the outer ring of triazine or heptazine
units in accordance to the literature.14,15 The absence
of a signal reported for heptazines in the region of −225 to
−235 ppm suggests that no central heptazine nitrogen atom is
present.2 The signal at −249.5 ppm
can be assigned to bridging NH groups of PTI. The latter signal at
−296.4 ppm is ascribed to the nitrogen atom in the amine groups.
These assignments are confirmed by the correlated 1H NMR
spectrum, which shows three signals for the amine group centered at
6.52 ppm and one signal at 8.68 ppm for bridging imide groups. Figure S5b shows the solid state CPMAS 15N NMR spectrum of PTI. Three main signals at −218.0, −241.5,
and −292.6 ppm are present and confirm the liquid-state NMR.

XPS measurements are performed to analyze the PTI composition. Figure S6a shows the survey spectra of the PTI
and demonstrates the corresponding C 1s and N 1s peaks. The deconvoluted
XP spectra of C 1s and N 1s regions are shown in Figure 4. The deconvoluted C 1s peak
(Figure 4a) demonstrates
four components at binding energies (BEs) of 284.5, 285.3, 288.15,
and 289.5 eV. These components correspond to the graphitic carbon,
aliphatic carbon, C–N, and carboxylic groups, respectively.
The dominant C 1s peak at 288.1 eV originates from sp2,
where the carbon atom bonds to N inside the triazine ring.65,66 The contribution of the carbon groups at the BE of 289.5 eV is attributed
to the hydroxyl and carboxylate groups and reveals oxidation of the
surface during the electrochemical induced synthesis. The corresponding
O peaks for the −OH and −COOH are observed at 531.1
and 532.1 eV, respectively (see O 1s peak in Figure S6b). Deconvoluted N 1s spectra presented in Figure 4b shows three peaks centered
at 398.4, 399.6, and 400.7 eV assigned to the sp2 nitrogen
in the triazine ring, bridging N atoms, and the primary amine groups,
respectively.12,65−67

Figure 4 C 1s (a) and N 1s (b)
XP spectra of PTI. Red circles denote the
measured data and the fits are represented by blue curves. With an
increasing excitation wavelength, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra
of PTI in NaOH solution (pH 12) shows a red shift in the PL (c). The
PL excitation (PLE) spectrum shows two maxima. The first and more
intense is found at 330 nm and is contributed by PTI; the second at
370 nm is assigned to Raman scattering of water (d). The asterisks
in (c,d) mark measurement artifacts at double excitation wavelength
and the excitation wavelength, respectively.

Thermogravimetric analysis shows the high temperature stability
of PTI (Figure S7). With an increasing
temperature, water desorbs, and at 100 °C, a plateau is reached
independently of the surrounding atmosphere. At 300 °C, in an
ambient atmosphere, a constant mass loss is observed, which we assume
to be determined by the sublimation of PTI as well as the complete
decomposition at higher temperatures. A complete mass loss is observed
at 575 °C. In a nitrogen atmosphere, at 300 °C, significant
mass loss is observed as well, but a second plateau is reached at
450 °C. This plateau may be reached because of further condensation
of PTI. It is followed by further mass loss until a minimum of 2%
residue mass is observed at 675 °C. In contrast to the measurements
in the ambient atmosphere, a black residue remains.

The PL spectrum
of PTI in NaOH at pH 12 indicates a distinct emission
maximum at 425 nm at an excitation wavelength of 250 nm (Figure 4a). With an increasing
excitation wavelength, a red shift is observed up to 447 nm. The red
shift might be explained by electronic transitions which become unlikely
at lower energies and are in general observed because of the changes
in the electronic structure of PTI due to the deprotonation. This
property is not observed for PTI in DMSO (shown in Figure S8a). The emission maximum only slightly varies around
443 nm. In both solvents, the emission covers a large range of the
visible spectrum, which makes PTI a promising material for UV and
white-light LEDs. This property as well as the spontaneous dissolution
of PTI in polar aprotic solvents [dimethylformamide, DMSO, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone,
dimethylacetamide] has been recently described by Miller et al.60 In contrast to their reports, we do not observe
any broadening of the emission with an increasing excitation wavelength
of PTI neither in NaOH nor in DMSO. The full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) found for the latter is around 120 nm independently of the
excitation wavelength, while the former shows a narrower fwhm of around
100 nm. The PLE spectrum of PTI in NaOH solution shows a high intensity
at 332 nm, as it has also been reported by Miller et al. Additionally,
we observe a smaller maximum at 370 nm, whereas the reported maximum
of few layer PTI nanosheets at 270 nm could not be observed in NaOH
solution (Figure S8b). Raman scattering
of water results in the maximum at 370 nm. In DMSO, the PLE maximum
is found at 357 nm and only one peak is observed (Figure S8b). We explain the differences in the spectra by
emphasizing the different mechanisms of the dissolution processes.
In NaOH, PTI is deprotonated, and therefore, the electronic properties
are influenced, whereas in DMSO, PTI is not chemically altered. The
energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of 3.28 eV is determined through
a Tauc plot (Figure S9b), which was extracted
from a diffuse reflectance spectrum (Figure S9a).

Photocatalytic Experiments
Prior to photocatalytic
experiments, the adsorption of ionic dyes on PTI was investigated.
The cationic dye MB and the anionic dye NYS were used. Because of
charges generated by adjusting the pH value, the adsorption behavior
of the ionic dyes is influenced. It was shown that MB adsorbs well
at neutral (pH 7, capacity for MB: 0.04 mmol/g) and increased pH values
(pH 11, capacity for MB: 0.06 mmol/g), but it has a small adsorption
capacity at low pH values (pH 3, capacity for MB: 0.02 mmol/g). For
NYS, in contrast, the adsorption at neutral (pH 7, capacity for NYS:
0.07 mmol/g) and increased pH values (pH 11, capacity for NYS: 0.03
mmol/g) is small compared to decreased pH values (pH 3, capacity for
NYS: 0.22 mmol/g). Hence, we show that by adjusting the pH value in
the experiment specific adsorption of charged molecules can be achieved.
This property is important for the selectivity of the catalyst to
bind specific molecules and influences the catalytic activity. Figure 5a shows the pH value-dependent
adsorption capacity of PTI for MB and NYS. The adsorption capacity
was determined at the equilibrium of the adsorption and desorption
processes, which was reached after 60 min (Figure S10).

Figure 5 Adsorption capacity of PTI for the ionic dyes NYS (black
squares)
and MB (blue circles) at different pH values. PTI shows a higher capacity
for the anionic NYS at low pH values because of charging of PTI by
protonation. In contrast, the adsorption of cationic MB is increased
at high pH values because of the charges formed because of deprotonation
of PTI (a). Logarithmic plots of the intensity of the MB solution
against the duration of the degradation in recycling experiments (b)
as well as at different pH values (c). The intensity was determined
at the absorption maximum at 664 nm. The reaction constants were determined
by fitting the linear region at 120–240 min. Logarithmic plot
of intensity of the MB solution against the duration of the degradation
at pH 7. Different scavengers were used to determine the active species
in the degradation process. It is shown that p-benzoquinone
lowers the degradation rate for a certain time (d).

These experiments were followed by dye degradation
experiments
under illumination with a xenon lamp in combination with a water filter
to exclude thermal effects. For NYS, no significant degradation was
observed, therefore only the degradation of MB is described in the
following section. The spectrum of the lamp used for the photocatalytic
experiments is shown in Figure S11. The
UV–vis spectra used to determine the intensity at the maximum
at 664 nm as well as the references are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S12).

Degradation of MB
The performed experiments prove the
photocatalytic activity of PTI in the degradation process of MB. It
was shown that degradation of MB could be observed for at least three
cycles at neutral pH value (Figure 5b). However, it has to be conceded that the degradation
rate decreases significantly by a factor of 3 (cycle 1: k1 = 1.5 ×10–3 min–1, cycle 2: k2 = 0.8 × 10–3 min–1, and cycle 3: k3 = 0.4 × 10–3 min–1, k was determined using linear regression of the data points
for 120, 180, and 240 min). Besides, it has also been shown that the
pH value has a strong influence on the reaction rate constant. The
logarithmic plots are shown in Figure 5c. At low pH values, the adsorption of MB is lowered
(0.02 mmol/g at pH 3), whereas at high pH values (0.06 mmol/g at pH
11) a 3 times higher amount of dye can be adsorbed. The degradation
rates determined at pH 3, pH 7, and pH 11 are kpH3 = 0.6 × 10–3 min–1, kpH7 = 1.5 × 10–3 min–1, and kpH11 =
1.5 × 10–3 min–1. It can
be observed that by adjusting the pH the degradation rate can be influenced.
In comparison to the degradation rates at pH 7 and pH 11, the rate
at pH 3 is lowered by the factor of 2.5, which is in good agreement
with the observed lower adsorption capacity.

Investigation of Different
Active Species
Different
scavenger molecules have been added to the photocatalytic experiments
to investigate the active species in the degradation process. The
influence of holes, hydroxyl radicals, as well as superoxide radicals
was determined by adding EDTA-2Na, t-butanol, and p-benzoquinone, respectively. As shown in Figure 5d at pH 7, the addition of
EDTA-2Na does not have any influence on the degradation rate (kEDTA-2Na = 2.3 × 10–3 min–1) of MB. Thus, it is assumed that hydroxyl
radicals are not the active species in the degradation process. Adding t-BuOH to the experiment results in a slightly lowered degradation
rate (kt-BuOH =
1.0 × 10–3 min–1). In contrast, p-benzoquinone has a significant influence. It is observed
that for nearly 2 h of illumination, no degradation is observed and
no reaction constant could be determined. Instead, a shift in the
absorption of p-benzoquinone is observed. After 2
h, no further shifting is occurring and the degradation of MB takes
place. The reaction constant in this regime is in the same range as
the degradation without any scavenger. Therefore, it is concluded
that superoxide radicals are the main active species and that these
radicals only react with MB after the reaction with p-benzoquinone is completed.

Conclusions
In
summary, this work describes a new approach for the synthesis
of a triazine-based carbon nitride material which we identified as
PTI. This approach has its origin in a synthesis described for triazine-based
graphitic carbon nitride by Lu et al.59 Our modification of the synthesis approach yields PTI, which we
identified with the help of several characterization techniques, for
example, XPS, powder XRD, FTIR, and two-dimensional liquid-state NMR
spectroscopy. The latter is a rarity for carbon nitride materials
because the solubility in common solvents is low. Because of this
synthesis approach, oxygen-containing functional groups are incorporated
in the structure of PTI resulting in the possibility of protonation
and deprotonation. This charging leads to an increased solubility.
The as-obtained PTI has a comparably high specific surface area and
also shows high-temperature stability. We showed the photocatalytic
properties of PTI in the degradation process of ionic dyes and discussed
the influence of the pH value in this process, especially in the adsorption
process. We were able to influence the adsorption capacity of PTI
for different molecules by adjusting the pH value. The addition of
different scavengers showed that superoxide radicals are the main
active species in the presented degradation experiments.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Melamine (99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
sodium hydroxide (97%) was purchased from Grüssing GmbH, MB
was purchased from Merck Chemicals GmbH, NYS was purchased from Alfa
Aesar, tert-butanol (99%) was purchased from Grüssing
GmbH, EDTA-2Na (>98.5%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, para-benzoquinone was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and recrystallized
in 2-propanol, and terephthalic acid (98%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis of PTI
Melamine (945 mg; 7.5 mmol) was dissolved
in 100 mL of demineralized water at 65 °C under vigorous stirring.
In a three electrode setup with a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl/KCl),
counter electrode (platinum), and working electrode (platinum), a
voltage of 5 V was applied for 6 h at 65 °C without stirring.
The distance between counter and working electrodes was 0.5 cm. The
current increased linearly during the reaction from 1 to 200 mA, and
the formation of gases at the electrode surfaces increased as well.
After 6 h, the product was obtained in a brownish suspension. A scheme
of the setup is shown in Figure S1.

The suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 7500 rpm (13 206
rcf). The supernatant was discarded. The residue was dispersed in
30 mL of hot demineralized water. This process was repeated three
times. The washed product was freeze-dried and obtained as a pale
yellowish powder. This synthesis approach and the following washing
procedure yield in average 55 mg of PTI.

Photocatalytic Experiments
The catalyst material (50
mg) was dispersed in 100 mL of either a 10 mg/L MB or a 60 mg/L NYS
solution and stirred for 1 h in the dark to set an adsorption/desorption
equilibrium. As a light source, a 300 W xenon lamp (UXL-302-O) combined
with a water filter to avoid heating effects by infrared radiation
was used. Aliquots of 4 mL were taken every 60 min (or 30 min for
scavenger experiments). The aliquots were centrifuged once at 11 000
rpm (28 408 rcf) to remove the catalyst material. The supernatant
was filtered using a hydrophilic syringe filter (nylon, 0.2 μm
pore size).

The pH value was adjusted in the experiments by
the addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide before the addition
of the catalyst. All of the measurements were controlled by performing
the same experiments without illumination as well as without the catalyst.

To identify the reactive species in the degradation process, experiments
were conducted as described above, but tert-butanol
(10 vol %), EDTA-2Na (10 mM), or para-benzoquinone
(10 mM) was added to the experiment.
