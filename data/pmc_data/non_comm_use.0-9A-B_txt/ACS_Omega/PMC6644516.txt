Facile
creation of multiple drops at appropriate volumes on surfaces
without the use of sophisticated instrumentation facilitates downstream
evaporative preconcentration of liquid samples for analytical purposes.
In this work, a superhydrophobic (SH) substrate comprising wells with
a perforated mesh base was developed for simultaneous drop creation
in a quick and convenient manner. In contrast to the method of pouring
liquid directly over the SH wells, consistent liquid filling was readily
achieved by a simple immersion approach. This method works well even
for challenging situations where well diameters are smaller than 3.4
mm. Despite the poor liquid-retention properties of SH surfaces, inverting
the wells did not result in liquid detachment under gravitational
force, indicating strong pinning effects afforded by the well architecture.
The perforated base of the well allowed the liquid to be completely
removed from the well by compressed air. High-speed camera image processing
was used to study the evolution of drop contact angle and displacement
with time. It was found that the liquid body was able to undergo strong
oscillations. Optical spectroscopy was used to confirm the ability
of evaporative preconcentration of silver nanoparticles.

Introduction
The attractive physicochemical properties
of nanoparticles, in
particular, their extremely small size, large specific surface area,
and unique optical properties, have led to growing interest in the
development of diverse applications in the fields of medicine, electronics,
chemical, and clean energy production. However, these nanomaterials
can enter human and animal systems through many pathways and exert
harmful effects at the cellular, tissue, and organ level.1,2 The exact underlying mechanism of this toxicity remains to be clearly
established, but recent studies have indicated the involvement of
oxidative stress inducement,3,4 proinflammatory gene
activation,5,6 and ATP deprivation leading to autophagy
and apoptosis.7 In view of the potential
toxicological effects associated with nanoparticle exposures, various
entry routes of nanoparticles from emission sources to the natural
environment, including atmospheric outfalls, solid surface leaching,
and industrial or urban emissions from municipal wastewater treatment
plants are of major concern.8 Effective
implementation of remediation efforts, an area of recent intense pursuit,9−11 relies heavily on the availability of sensitive instrumental tools
for environmental nanomonitoring. Although nanoparticles are ubiquitously
found in natural systems, their presence at trace concentrations represents
a major impediment to their detection and monitoring. To address this
issue, highly sensitive (and normally expensive) methods of detection
are required.12,13 Effective approaches to preconcentrate
the nanoparticles in solution prior to sensing can ameliorate this.

Effective preconcentration with minimal sample loss by entity deposition
on surfaces is achieved by minimizing the area of contact between
a solid substrate and the liquid sample. Superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces,
now created by a wide variety of surface treatment methods,14−16 offer the ideal means to accomplish this. Liquid bodies on SH surfaces
assume drops that exhibit high contact angles and low surface attachment.
Such wetting behaviors are governed by two-phase (liquid and air)
and three-phase (liquid, solid, and air) interactions.17 Recently, a “manhole” preconcentration
approach18 based on evaporation19 and suitable for field application was reported.
To attain higher detection sensitivity, the preconcentration process
is performed by creating multiple drops where volume reduction is
achieved in successive stages (see Figure 1A). In this work, we describe a scheme whereby
the key objectives are to create multiple drops at preselected volumes
simultaneously, quickly, and conveniently. This scheme which relies
on SH well architectures is also designed to operate seamlessly with
the preconcentration approach to achieve minimal sample loss by surface
deposition reported previously.18 The key
functions pursued include the ability to attain consistent liquid
well-filling by immersion and for the formed drops to be dispensed
from the wells readily. Two well designs, one with a solid (Figure 1B) and the other
with a meshed base (Figure 1C), are investigated.

Figure 1 To obtain a high degree of preconcentration,
a series of drops
can be reduced in size by evaporation so that they fall through under
the manhole effect and can then be collected to form a cascading process
(A). Drops for pre-evaporation are to be created simultaneously by
immersion into water through SH well architectures that can have a
solid (B) or mesh (C) base.

Materials and Methods
Substrate Preparation
Holes of various
sizes were drilled
through 2 and 4 mm thick copper plates to form the side walls of the
wells. Holes with diameters of 2.4, 2.8, and 3 mm were created in
2 mm thick copper plates, whereas larger holes with diameters of 3.4,
3.7, 3.8, 4.1, and 4.6 mm were made in 4 mm thick plates. The base
of the wells was made of either a thin copper plate (thickness = 1
mm) or a copper mesh (wire thickness = 0.1 mm, spacing = 0.3 mm).
All of the plate samples were polished until they were shiny (the
mesh base was not polished). They were then ultrasonicated in ethanol
(70 v/v %) and acetone for 3 min and subsequently in deionized (DI)
water for another 15 min. The substrates were oxidized in a solution
containing 2 M NaOH and 1.5 M (NH4)2S2O8 for 5 min. The samples were then allowed to synthesize
in an oven at 180 °C for 120 min to complete the phase transfer
from hydroxides to oxides. At the end of the reaction, the substrate
was removed from the solution, rinsed several times with DI water
and ethanol, and then dried using compressed air. In the final step,
the substrates were silanized using flame absorption spectroscopy
(FAS) (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl-triethoxysilane) to obtain a
low-surface energy material with good corrosion resistance and thermal
stability. The substrate was immersed in FAS–ethanol solution
for 30 min and dried in the oven at 150 °C for 10 min. Finally,
the base of the wells was formed by using epoxy to attach either the
silanized thin copper plates or copper mesh to the silanized thick
copper plates with holes.

Characterization of Surfaces
Representative
samples
of the silanized copper plate and mesh were placed on stubs using
conductive adhesive and examined using a scanning electron microscope
(FEI, Nova Nano SEM 430). Optical profilometry was also used to examine
the surface of the copper plate. Images of the copper surface located
1 mm from the hole was obtained. The sample was attached onto a flat
silicon surface that served as the reference surface. Optical scans
obtained from the profilometer (Bruker Contour GT-I) were processed
and analyzed using the instrument’s accompanying software (Contour
Elite). Because of the relatively large surface area to be examined,
multiple images were recorded and the software-stitching capability
was used to construct an integrated map over an extended field of
view.

The contact angles of 10 μL sessile water drops
dispensed on the substrate were measured using the Kruss DSA100S system.
The mean value from 10 separate readings was found to be 158°
(σ = 0.80°). The inclination angle needed for the displacement
of 10 μL drops was found to be 3°.

Liquid Filling
The SH samples (with wells facing upward)
were placed on a holder and lowered slowly into a beaker of water
to a depth of 20 mm below the water surface (Figure 2A) to allow the well liquid filling by hydrostatic
pressure alone.19 The substrate was held
in position for 10 s and then raised up slowly.20

Figure 2 (A) Immersion method was conducted by using a holder to slowly
lower the SH sample (with wells) into a beaker to a specific depth h below the water surface. The amount of water retained
in the well was then evaluated. (B) Propensity of the liquid drop
to be displaced from the well was determined by inverting the substrate.
In the case of wells with a meshed base, a jet of compressed air was
delivered by placing the distal end of the air tube at a fixed distance h′ from the superhydrophobic base of the well. The
air pressure was controlled by a valve, and the pressure applied was
measured by a manometer.

The volume of liquid collected in the well was determined
using
two methods. For large wells on the 4 mm thick substrate, liquid drop
volume was determined by mass measurement using a weighing scale (Ohaus,
SE2020) with 0.01 g resolution before and after the liquid was completely
removed by absorption onto the paper towel. In the case of more challenging
smaller wells on the 2 mm thick substrate, a glass capillary tube
(inner diameter = 0.58 mm) was used to completely drain the liquid
from the well, and the drop volume was then determined from the length
of the liquid column in the capillary tube.

The liquid retention
characteristics of the drops in wells were
evaluated by inverting the SH substrate (Figure 2B), and side views were recorded using a
camera (Moticam 3) with diffuse back-illumination.

Liquid Displacement
In the case of wells with a meshed
base, liquid drops were displaced by delivering compressed air from
a tube placed at a fixed distance h′ (10 mm)
from the base (Figure 2B). Valve-controlled air pressure was measured via a digital manometer
(Digitron, 2002P) placed in the airflow line. The discharged air pressure
was correlated with the force exerted through a calibration procedure
where a weighing scale (OHAUS, SE2020) with 0.01 g resolution was
placed at the same distance h′ away from the
distal end of the tube. The manner in which the drops were displaced
from the wells was observed by high-speed side-view images recorded
using a camera (Fastec) at 250 frames per second.

Spectroscopic
Measurement of Silver Nanoparticle Concentration
Silver nanoparticles
(40 nm average diameter; Sigma-Aldrich) was
suspended at a concentration of 20 μg/mL in aqueous buffer containing
sodium citrate as a stabilizer. This sample was diluted with DI water
to obtain a nanoparticle concentration of 0.032 μg/mL. The evaporative
concentration approach described in this work was used to create preconcentrated
samples. The concentration of silver nanoparticles in the preconcentrated
sample was determined from their UV light absorbance spectra. Sample
absorbance was measured in a 10 cm path-length quartz cuvette placed
between a UV LED light source (Jaycar, ZD0260; emission maximum at
400 nm) and the distal end of an optical fiber that was connected
to a spectrometer (Ocean Optics).

Results and Discussion
SEM images of the SH plate and mesh surfaces are shown in Figure 3A,B, respectively.
The hierarchical microscale and nanoscale structures are predominantly
prismatic. Apart from this, no other artefacts were found that could
have contributed to the predominant Cassie wetting characteristics
observed. Figure 4A,B
shows the corresponding optical profilometry traces of the SH plate
and mesh surfaces. This provided further confirmation that even at
a larger length scale no other surface artefacts were present that
could have contributed to the predominantly Cassie wetting characteristics.
Additionally, the low-adhesion characteristics of the substrate were
corroborated by the displacement of 10 μL drops off the surface
with inclinations as low as 3°.

Liquid well filling using
the immersion approach is depicted in Figure 2A. The volume of
liquid in the wells of various sizes is shown in Figure 5 and is consistently demonstrated
to be higher than the corresponding theoretical well volume indicated
as red dots on the plots. Evidently, overfilling of the wells occurred
whereby a convex meniscus was formed over the mouth of the well. The
volume of liquid filling the wells showed only small variations in
repeat measurements, indicating that the immersion approach was suitable
for use in the evaporative preconcentration scheme, as outlined in Figure 1A.

Figure 5 Box plots of the volumes
of liquid formed in the wells of the 4
and 2 mm thick SH plates with various well diameters via the immersion
approach depicted in Figure 2A (taken from 10 repetitions). The theoretical liquid fill
volume based on the calculated internal well volume is denoted by
the dot indicated for each well diameter.

As an alternative to the immersion approach, attempts were
also
made to fill the wells by tilting the substrate to an angle of 5°
to the horizontal and pouring liquid down the inclined surface from
the raised end. The measured volumes collected in the wells showed
significantly higher variations than the immersion method (see Figure 6). This can be attributed
to the dynamic nature of of liquid-well interaction which in turn
affects the ability of the three-phase contact lines to pin adequately.
The lack of sufficient hydrostatic pressure as liquid moving over
the top of the well is also another contributing factor for poor liquid
filling. It is noteworthy that liquid filling did not occur when the
well diameters were smaller than 3.4 mm. This may be attributed to
the strong nonwetting characteristics of the surface that would tend
to prevent liquid from entering the well. This behavior is exacerbated
by the dynamic actions occurring at the three-phase contact line and
the lack of hydrostatic pressure to aid the filling process. Capillarity
can be ruled out as a factor because of the relatively large diameters
of the wells involved.

Figure 6 Box plots of the volumes of liquid formed in the wells
of the 4
mm thick SH plate with various well diameters by pouring liquid down
the inclined substrate. Liquid could not fill the wells that are smaller
than 3.4 mm in diameter via this method.

Surprisingly, liquid was retained within the well when the
SH substrate
with a solid base was inverted (Figure 7A). This phenomena could be attributed to some initial
air entrapment during filling. It is then possible that the liquid
is held in place because of a pressure differential between the entrapped
air and that in the environment. However, a similar liquid retention
behavior was also observed for wells with a meshed base (where the
side-view image of the drop appeared exactly the same, as shown in Figure 7A). Hence, this explanation
for liquid retention as a result of air entrapment cannot hold true
because pressure equalization would occur in the latter case. The
strong liquid retention is then likely caused by increased pinning
offered by the edges of the well. Strong pinning from edges of hydrophilic
surfaces is well-known and has been demonstrated.21,22 That the same increased pinning effects are observed here using
substrates that manifest predominant Cassie wetting correlates with
recent findings of drops strongly retained on holes created on thin
SH substrates.23

Figure 7 (A) Side-view image of
a drop at rest in a 2.4 mm diameter well
with the substrate inverted. The horizontal dotted line marks the
nadir position of the drop at rest when no air actuation is applied.
(B) Sequence of high-speed camera images (from left to right) showing
the side view of a drop as it is dislodged from the well (with meshed
material as base) when an air pressure of 12 mbar was applied downward
from the top of the substrate through the mesh base. Drops in wells
with a solid or meshed SH base showed the same behavior.

Liquid may be recovered from the well in two ways;
by application
of impact forces or by transference of the liquid to a substrate with
higher wetting properties. The former results in poor movement control
and potentially some sample loss, whereas the latter does not fit
with the scheme of subsequent evaporative preconcentration on SH manholes.
The meshed base architecture presents an opportunity to use a third
method; that of compressed air delivered down toward the mesh base
to displace the liquid from the well. The relative “gentleness”
of air in actuating liquids on low wetting surfaces had been demonstrated
previously.24Figure 8 presents results showing the air pressure
needed to just dislodge the liquid from the well. As expected, higher
pressure is needed for wells with smaller diameters because liquid
volumes are smaller and hence higher surface tension forces are exerted.
It was observed that relatively small variations in air pressure were
needed to completely remove liquid from wells of a specific diameter.
This finding makes it possible to determine the minimum pressure needed
to empty all of the wells consistently. For instance, the application
of an air pressure of 12.5 mbar will remove liquid from the 2.4 mm
diameter well all of the time. Hence, this air pressure will be more
than sufficient to remove liquid from wells of larger diameters. The
applicability of a fixed air pressure setting is advantageous in field
applications, whereby standard air dusters can be used to deliver
the required force for liquid dislodgement from the wells. However,
this may have an impact on the speed at which the drop leaves the
well and subsequently on the force with which the liquid impinges
on its destination substrate. This has been extensively studied25,26 wherein the ability of the drop to execute elastic rebounds especially
on increasingly hydrophobic destination substrates has received particular
attention.27−29

Figure 8 Box plots of the air pressures needed to dislodge the
liquid formed
in the wells of the 2 mm thick SH plate with various well diameters.
Larger air pressures are needed for smaller wells because of higher
surface tension forces.

At this juncture, it is noteworthy that compressed air was
delivered
through a refrigerated compressed air dryer before use. In the unit,
the inlet warm wet air was cooled to about 3 °C, where any water
vapor that developed was condensed into water and then removed via
a water trap. Subsequently, the cold air was reheated to room temperature.
Hence, it was unlikely that any vapor in the compressed air contributed
significantly to the detachment process.

High-speed camera images
of the liquid body as it was displaced
from the well showed an early stage axis-symmetric drop that evolved
to an asymmetric form over time (Figure 7B). There was also an absence of any pinch-off
that is typically observed for liquid dripping from a faucet.30 This is not surprising as the entire liquid
body was essentially displaced out of the well without any continuum
of liquid to fill the space behind it. With an increasing absence
of liquid–solid interactions, there is propensity for the liquid
to attach preferentially to one side of the well in the later stages
because it is impossible to ensure equal wettability all around. In
doing so, the axis-symmetric nature of the liquid body disappears.
This has the effect of displacing the delivered drop from the central
axis of the well, albeit the extent of this is not significant. Receptacles
with geometries (e.g., truncated cones) that help to redirect the
drop to specific locations on the destination surface will ensure
that this is not a limitation. Alternatively, careful design of the
edges of the well offers the possibility of directing the detaching
drops toward more axis-symmetric deliveries. It is important to point
out that because there is no pinch-off, there is no development of
daughter drops which can contribute to any sample loss.

A quantitative
analysis of the sequence of images in Figure 7B indicated that drop dislodgement
occurred within a relatively short time of around 20 ms (Figure 9). The contact angle
was initially at 60° but increased to 100° around the mid-way
point followed by restoration to 60° prior to dislodgement (Figure 9A). The trace of
the nadir position of the liquid body (Figure 9B) relative to its origin, however, indicated
an almost linear increase with time till dislodgement. This behavior
is consistent with the lower portion of the liquid body moving in
a downward direction initially, whereas the contact line was being
pinned to increase the contact angle toward advancing. The continuing
motive force of air delivery presents the liquid body with two options;
either continue to manifest an increasing contact angle up to the
point of pinching off or to move itself out of the well. The latter
occurs because of the lack of a continuum of liquid being delivered
as well as the propensity of the rear contact line (which is higher
up) to move down. This causes the liquid body to assume a spherical
shape to minimize its surface energy, thus resulting in a reduction
in contact angle just prior to dislodgement.

Figure 9 Plots of (A) contact
angle, and (B) displacement of the nadir position
of liquid body in the 2.4 diameter well with time following air actuation
at 12 mbar and prior to its dislodgement. The nadir position of the
liquid body is defined as the lowest point of the liquid at rest within
an inverted SH well in the absence of air actuation, as indicated
by horizontal line shown in Figure 7A.

Because the liquid body
is subject to this form of perturbation,
the surface tension forces involved can drive it to respond dynamically.
This is also possible because of compressed air being used here which
generates a more stochastic driving impetus as opposed to gravity
forces acting alone.18,23 It is noteworthy that resonant
behavior had previously been observed in the presence of stochastic
perturbations31−33 and has been found to occur notwithstanding the small
restoring forces developed from SH surfaces.32,33 Although some small extent of this was discerned, the relatively
short time period leading to dislodgement does not furnish the means
to confirm this.

The contention that the liquid body in the
well exhibits oscillatory
behavior prior to dislodgement as a result of restoring forces leads
to the question of whether a more pronounced manifestation might be
exhibited if the drop was actuated by air but not to the extent that
it was dislodged from the well. Such a situation is depicted in the
high-speed camera sequences given in Figure 10B. The trace of contact angle evolution
with time (Figure 11A) shows the liquid body manifesting values that deviate from an
initial 60° and reaching a maximum of 130°. Interestingly,
periodic fluctuations were found along the way before the contact
angle values settled close to 90° at the point at which the liquid
body was detached and hanging outside the well. This indicated an
ability of the liquid body to exhibit pronounced oscillations in the
process. The extent of this behavior is better revealed by following
the corresponding displacement-time trace of the nadir position of
the liquid body (Figure 11B) from its origin. It is noteworthy that pendant drops actuated
by air pressure driven by a loudspeaker have been shown to exhibit
oscillations previously.34

Figure 10 Side view image of a
(A) drop at rest in a 2.4 mm diameter well
with a meshed SH base and the substrate inverted. The sequence of
high-speed camera images (from left to right) in (B) showing the side
view of a drop that is moved but not dislodged from the well when
an air pressure of 10 mbar was applied downward from the top of the
substrate through the mesh base.

Figure 11 Plots of (A) contact angle and (B) displacement of the nadir position
of the liquid body with time following air actuation and prior to
its dislodgement. The nadir position of the liquid body is defined
as the lowest point of the liquid at rest within an inverted SH well
in the absence of air actuation, as indicated by horizontal line shown
in Figure 7A.

It is important to note (from Figure 11B) that the liquid
body is pushed out to
its maximum extent at a very early stage of the actuation. This is
illustrated by the fact that it does not return to its original position
of Figure 10A even
after air actuation has ceased. With a displaced position downward,
the three-phase contact line is subject to an advancing state early
and is thus strongly affected by the added pinning from the edges
of the well. This then gives impetus for the liquid body to develop
restoring forces, notwithstanding the continued downward impetus provided
by the compressed air, such that oscillations are manifested. That
the degree of liquid body deformation is more pronounced initially,
gives rise to periods that were shorter initially (∼17 ms)
before lengthening gradually up to the stages before settling (∼25
ms). It is also noteworthy that the fluctuations exhibited diminishing
amplitudes (see Figure 11B). Taken together, this infers a mechanism in which the liquid
body undergoes gradual (a matter of perspective because this occurs
over only 350 ms) relaxation with time.

The absorbance scan
of the original nanoparticle sample (20 μg/mL)
in Figure 12 showed
a UV–vis peak wavelength around 400 nm. This result is in agreement
with that found in a previous study.35 When
this sample was diluted 625 times, its optical spectrum was almost
verbatim to that exhibited by water. Following preconcentration, peak
absorbance at 400 nm was restored, indicating the feasibility of the
evaporative approach. The absorbance values obtained from repeated
experiments (see inset of Figure 12) also indicate that the approach is reproducible.

Figure 12 Intensity
scans of the original silver nanoparticle sample (20
μg/mL), diluted nanoparticle sample (0.032 μg/mL), and
diluted sample that was preconcentrated. The water sample has a scan
similar to the diluted nanoparticle sample (0.032 μg/mL) and
is not plotted. The box plot shown in the inset represents the absorbance
distribution obtained from 10 preconcentrated samples.

On a final point of application, the well filling
approach here
is highly amenable for application in the field. By creating multiple
drops from an array of wells and releasing them into multiple holes
for preconcentration, it is possible to attain results more conveniently
and expeditiously, with the volume of each drop remaining consistent.
It is also important to note that the SH surfaces are self-cleaning
which obviates the use of solvents.

Conclusions
The
ability to form multiple drops simultaneously, quickly, conveniently,
and at prespecified volumes on surfaces of a SH construct, such that
it facilitates subsequent evaporative preconcentration, is demonstrated
here. The immersion approach to fill the wells, which yielded recovery
of consistent volumes of liquid, is an approach that can be conducted
with ease in the field. That strong liquid retention within the well
is observed even against gravitational forces when the substrate inverted
is advantageous because it allows subsequent delivery of the liquid
to a desired location on the destination surface. Actuation of liquid
removal by compressed air allows preselection of wells from which
the liquid body (from an array) is to be removed for collection. Complete
removal of liquid from the well by a burst of compressed air delivered
through the mesh base of the well is both convenient and gentle enough
not to foment formation of daughter drops, which engenders material
loss. The ability of the liquid body to undergo oscillations does
not have practical implications in the application context described
here. However, it illustrates a liquid behavior that has not been
reported to date and may be useful in developing density gradients
in liquids,36 from which convection can
then cause changes to the diffusion rates of molecules present in
the liquid sublayer.
