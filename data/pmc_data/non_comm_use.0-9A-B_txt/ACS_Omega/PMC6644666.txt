The
complete removal of biorecalcitrant xenobiotics, including
most notably the pharmaceutical pollutants, by advanced oxidation
processes is often difficult to be reached in urban or industrial
wastewater because of the high concentration of organic and inorganic
scavengers that compete with the xenobiotics for the oxidizing species.
This work investigates a coupled treatment train in which wastewater
effluents are pretreated with a negatively charged loose nanofiltration
(NF) membrane (HydraCoRe70, made up of sulfonated polyethersulfone)
to enhance the removal of xenobiotics with the thermal Fenton process.
Carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug prescribed mainly for epilepsy treatment,
is used here as a model xenobiotic. After optimizing the conditions
for separation and degradation, the NF–Fenton approach was
applied to both synthetic wastewater and real samples to assess the
overall efficiency of CBZ removal. The Fenton degradation of CBZ was
drastically enhanced in nanofiltered samples, thanks to the removal
by the membrane of nearly all organic matter that would otherwise
consume the reactive oxidizing species (e.g., the hydroxyl radical).
On the basis of a preliminary treatment cost analysis, it can be concluded
that the combined process is potentially applicable to the treatment
of several kinds of wastewaters (e.g., industrial ones) to favor the
removal of biorecalcitrant contaminants. Key cost savings of NF–Fenton
concern the lower amounts of Fenton reagents needed to degrade CBZ
and (even more importantly) the decreased levels of acids and bases
for pH adjustment before and after the oxidative process because of
the lower buffer capacity of the NF permeate compared to feed wastewater,
after the removal by the NF of many inorganic ions and most organic
carbon.

Introduction
The main scientific
and technological efforts in the field of wastewater
treatment (urban or industrial) have been focused in the past on the
implementation of plants able to reach a total abatement of the main
macropollutants.1 In this context, the
widely applied technologies based on the activated sludge are able
to satisfy the most recent legislations for the preservation of water
resources. However, the attention of the scientific community in the
field of water treatment has recently shifted to the ubiquitous occurrence
of micro- and biorecalcitrant contaminants in water environments.
These compounds are not or are only partially removed by the conventional
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which has raised concern in several
governmental authorities around the world.2,3 The
European Union has recently proposed the first Watch List of compounds
that pose a risk to the aquatic environment, based on in-depth comparative
studies of the most recent literature regarding the ecotoxicological
features of the most abundant micropollutants.4 Furthermore, the only partial abatement of micropollutants by the
traditional WWTPs hinders a safe reuse of the water after treatment
(e.g., for agriculture). This issue limits the resilience of human
societies that live in environments where water resources are either
scarce or will become so as a consequence of climate change. In the
absence of a total removal of micropollutants, the need to close the
water cycle to save water would in fact magnify the concentration
of these compounds and cause problems to both human health and natural
ecosystems.

Among the possible strategies to technologically
update the existing
WWTPs, the ability of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), and
particularly of the Fenton reaction, is well documented to remove
many recalcitrant pollutants from both urban and industrial wastewater.5−7 The most common interpretation of the mechanism of the Fenton reaction
is based on the proposal by Haber and Weiss and successive modifications.8 The starting process involves Fe(II) and H2O2 that generate hydroxyl radicals, which are able
to promote pollutant degradation. The Fenton reaction is mainly a
two-step process, with a first and kinetically fast step (ferrous
step) consisting in the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by H2O2 to produce •OH, followed by a slower
second step (ferric step) in which Fe(II) is regenerated, accounting
for the catalytic nature of the overall process.9,10

Several strategies have been proposed to speed up the slow (ferric)
step of the Fenton reaction and to increase the overall rates of pollutant
degradation, including the electron-Fenton process where Fe(III) reduction
is carried out at the surface of a cathode,11−13 the use of
sacrificial reductive agents,9,14−16 as well as the photo-Fenton reaction, with17,18 or without iron ligands.19−21 In the photo-Fenton reaction,
the absorption of light by FeIIIOH2+ or Fe3+–L complexes (where L = organic ligand) promotes Fe(III)
reduction with the production of, respectively, •OH or L•+. The real nature of the reactive species
in the Fenton process has long been debated, but a concomitant or
alternative role of •OH and superoxidized iron species
is usually proposed (e.g., ferryl ion FeO2+ or even Fe(V)
and Fe(VI) compounds10,22−24). The difficulties
related to the discrimination between •OH and high-valent
iron species, which often produce or are supposed to produce the same
byproducts or react with the same “selective” scavengers,
have prevented conclusive mechanistic considerations to be reached.

Irrespective of the actual reaction mechanism, some major drawbacks
of the Fenton treatment when applied to wastewater are as follows:
(i) the need to operate under acidic conditions, the optimal pH value
for Fenton degradation25 being usually
around 3, with the associated costs to adjust the pH for treatment
and back-adjust it to ∼neutral conditions before discharging
the treated effluent; (ii) the precipitation of a Fe(III) slurry in
the final basification step, with the subsequent need to separate
the solid from the aqueous phase, and (iii) the occurrence in the
wastewater of the species that can compete with the pollutant(s) for
the reaction with the oxidizing transients, such as the dissolved
organic matter (DOM) and inorganic ions such as HCO3–, CO32–, Cl–, Br–, and NO2–.26 Possible solutions to tackle these drawbacks
are as follows:(a) The immobilization of the iron centers
on solid supports27,28 or the use of iron-based solid
materials as sources of iron, such as magnetite,29−31 hematite,32,33 as well as zero-valent iron.29,34,35 These solid materials can be recovered at the end of the process,
for example, through their magnetic properties and reused;

(b) The implementation of
Fenton-like
reactions based on the production of reactive transients that are
more selective toward the pollutant to be degraded, such as the sulfate
radicals SO4•–. These transients
are generated from S2O82– instead
of H2O2. They react with similar kinetics as •OH toward aromatics but are less scavenged by natural
DOM;36,37

(c) The coupling of the Fenton reaction
with a separation step able to selectively remove the compounds that
scavenge the reactive transients. Separation and degradation are in
fact complementary mechanisms to purify water, and they may be applied
in synergy to ensure a water effluent of high quality.



Among the advantages of membrane processes compared
to other water
treatment techniques, one can enumerate modular composition, low energy
requirements, and no or little need to add chemicals.38 While membranes perform the selective removal of contaminants,
other treatment methods can be applied to degrade hazardous substances
and to inactivate microorganisms. Few studies have proposed the integration
of membrane filtration systems with different water treatment processes.39−41 Two examples of such integration are the coupling of coagulation
and flocculation with microfiltration in membrane bioreactors and
the combination of catalytic/AOPs with nanofiltration (NF). In recent
years, the latter systems have been studied to achieve micropollutant
abatement in wastewater treatment.42−44 The cited research studies
have highlighted the potential and the problems associated with the
polishing of the NF retentate stream by the application of AOPs, such
as Fenton oxidation. Specifically, high concentration of the organic
matter was shown to significantly reduce the oxidation efficiency
because of the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals, which increases the
demand of reagents to sustain oxidation. To cope with this drawback,
AOPs may be instead applied to the permeate stream produced by the
NF treatment of wastewater. In this configuration, low-pressure NF
removes organic matter and other scavengers from wastewater, thereby
enhancing the cost- and energy efficiency of the AOP oxidation of
the effluent containing the micropollutants. In this work, the efficacy
of this novel approach is investigated by using a membrane separation
to selectively eliminate the interfering agents of the Fenton process.

In this framework, this work was aimed at (i) exploring and evaluating
the potential coupling of a highly negatively charged, sulfonated
polyethersulfone loose NF membrane with a thermal Fenton process (the
wastewater effluent was treated by NF, followed by Fenton), to treat
wastewater with different amounts of organic carbon (as representative
samples, we chose urban wastewaters at two different stages of the
depuration process) and (ii) assessing treatment costs to verify the
feasibility of the coupled technology in real-world applications.
The main novelty of our study lies in the effective coupling of the
two systems, with the aim to prove that this coupling is feasible
and does not involve special operation on either treatment step. Indeed,
we tested the two processes in conventional operation to explore their
scalability.

Results and Discussion
Removal of Compounds by
NF
NF is proposed in this study
as a separation process in wastewater treatment to remove dissolved
and suspended organic macromolecules. The removal of organic macromolecules
allows for the achievement of low chemical oxygen demand and total
organic carbon (TOC) values in the effluent. The main hypothesis to
be tested is that NF acts as an effective pretreatment step to maximize
the efficiency and to decrease the costs associated with the Fenton
reaction, applied to remove recalcitrant micropollutants from wastewater.

The properties of the two real wastewater samples investigated
in this work are reported in the Experimental Section. These samples are denoted hereafter as Primary sample and Secondary sample. Figure 1 summarizes the main experimental results
obtained in laboratory NF tests, by the application of Hydra70 membranes.
The latter were used to treat either synthetic feed waters containing
model macromolecules such as humic acids (HAs), sodium alginate (Alg),
and bovine serum albumin (BSA) or an effluent (Primary and Secondary sample) from an urban WWTP facility.
All of the feed waters were spiked with carbamazepine (CBZ). The Hydra70
membrane completely removed HAs regardless of the pH of the feed solution,
whereas the removal of CBZ was always lower than 25% and displayed
a decreasing trend with increasing pH. In particular, the removal
of CBZ was negligible at pH > 7 (Figure 1a). These results are explained by a major
contribution of size exclusion in the removal of HAs, and size exclusion
is evidently not affected by HA protonation at acidic pH (humic substances
are weak polyelectrolytes). CBZ is a neutral molecule across the entire
pH range investigated in this study, and the observed increase in
its rejection at pH < 6 may be rationalized as enhanced hydrophobic
interactions with HAs. Indeed, HAs are expected to become progressively
less charged as the pH decreases, which enhances interaction with
neutral CBZ and leads to rejection by the membrane surface of the
CBZ molecules involved into associations with HAs. This study suggests
that the application of loose NF in ∼neutral pH conditions
causes near complete removal of HAs, together with negligible removal
of CBZ. This behavior is very interesting because it allows for the
abatement of interfering agents from the effluent, while simultaneously
avoiding the concentration of CBZ in the NF retentate stream that
would otherwise require a dedicated micropollutant treatment for safe
disposal. Indeed, previous studies using highly selective polyamide-based
NF membranes to remove pharmaceuticals from municipal wastewater showed
rejection rates larger than 97% for CBZ, flumequine, and ibuprofen,
but they highlighted that high amounts of Fenton reagents were then
needed to degrade these compounds in the retentate stream.42,43 In addition, the use of more selective membranes for the removal
of small molecules such as CBZ entails higher energy consumption,
as well as highly increased problems connected with fouling (Baker,
2012).

Figure 1 Results of membrane (Hydra70) separation tests with synthetic and
real feed water streams. (A) Rejection of HAs and CBZ as a function
of pH, in a feed solution containing a mixture of salts and mimicking
a typical wastewater effluent. (B) TOC rejection obtained with feed
waters containing different organic macromolecules and with the Primary sample at pH 7.4. (C) Permeate fluxes determined
when treating Secondary and Primary sample during the initial 2.5 h of treatment at an applied pressure of
300 psi; the dotted line is the steady-state value obtained with pure
water. All experiments were performed at a feed water temperature
of 22 °C.

Analogous results were
obtained by using feed solution waters containing
different representative organic macromolecules or actual effluents
(i.e., Primary sample and Secondary sample), all spiked with CBZ (see Figure 1b). The rejection of the TOC by the Hydra70 membrane
was always above 90% at pH 7.4, whereas the rejection of CBZ was always
lower than 5% (data not shown). These values suggest near complete
rejection of large organic macromolecules regardless of their nature,
which removes potential Fenton interfering agents from the effluent
and may help in the optimization of the subsequent oxidation step.
Our results are consistent with those obtained in previous studies
where NF was proven to be an efficient technology for the removal
of organic molecules from wastewater, with rejection rates always
higher than 85%.45,46 Fouling was shown to be the main
drawback in these applications, decreasing the permeate flux in accordance
with the results presented in Figure 1.

The steady-state values of the permeate flux
obtained when treating
the primary effluent were in the range of 25–30 L m–2 h–1 (LMH) at an applied pressure of 300 psi (20.7
bar). As shown in Figure 1c, the permeate flux decreased rapidly in the first part of
the test because of (i) membrane compaction, (ii) the initial accumulation
of fouling substances on the membrane surface, and (iii) the establishment
of an osmotic pressure profile at the membrane/feed interface. The
value of permeate flux at the steady state for the Primary
sample was approximately three times lower than that obtained
with pure water, and it was half of the flux that was observed
during the treatment of the Secondary sample. The Secondary sample, less loaded with organic materials and
suspended solids compared with the Primary sample, was in fact also assessed for comparison. The range of permeate
flux observed when treating the primary effluent is suitable for a
cost-effective purification of this stream, if accompanied by a correct
management of the membrane system as discussed in the technoeconomic
assessment of the proposed treatment train (vide infra).

Coupling of
NF and the Fenton Reaction for CBZ Degradation in
Synthetic Solutions
The first experiments of Fenton CBZ degradation
had the goal of optimizing the conditions to reach a complete substrate
removal in the desired reaction time (≤30 min). Both the pure
Fenton experiments and the NF–Fenton coupling tests were initially
carried out with a CBZ concentration (Co = 10 ppm) higher than usually found in real samples. The main rationale
for this choice was to minimize the uncertainty related to the determination
of concentration values that are relatively near the high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) limit of detection. Moreover, the use
of an elevated Co value would also stress
the degradation ability of the investigated technology. Figure 2 shows the time trend of 10
ppm CBZ with increasing initial concentration values of hydrogen peroxide
(1, 2, 3 mM) at constant initial [Fe(II)] = 0.1 mM (Figure 2a), as well as with increasing
Fe(II) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 mM) at constant [H2O2]
= 2 mM (Figure 2b).
The pH value of all the experiments was 3 by H2SO4, which is the optimum pH of the Fenton reaction.25 The choice of sulfuric acid was motivated by the facts
that its counterion does not scavenge •OH (differently
from the case of HCl;47 Buxton et al.,
1988) and it is nontoxic (unlike HNO3 and HClO4). As often observed for the thermal Fenton process,10 the degradation of CBZ was a two-step pathway made up of
a fast initial step [the ferrous step, triggered by the reaction between
Fe(II) and H2O2] lasting around 1 min or less,10 followed by a slower ferric step dominated by
Fe(III) reduction. For this reason, for the fact that Fe2+ and H2O2 react in 1:1 ratio, as well as for
the ability of H2O2 to scavenge •OH, no complete CBZ degradation could be achieved with 0.1 mM Fe(II),
even by increasing the H2O2 concentration. In
contrast, by doubling the concentration of Fe(II) from 0.1 to 0.2
mM, we observed a complete CBZ removal in the first 5 min of the reaction
(mostly carried out in the ferrous step, with some eventual contribution
by the ferric one). Therefore, the degradation experiments that follow
were carried out with 2 mM H2O2 and 0.2 mM Fe(II),
always at pH 3.

Figure 2 Time trend of CBZ (initial concentration 10 ppm, pH 3
by H2SO4) under different Fenton conditions:
(A) increasing
concentration of H2O2 (1, 2, and 3 mM) with
[Fe(II)] = 0.1 mM; (B) increasing concentration of Fe(II) (0.1, 0.2,
and 0.3 mM) with [H2O2] = 2 mM. Inset: Time
trend of CBZ (triangles, left Y-axis) and acridine
(diamonds, right Y-axis) under the following conditions: Co(CBZ) = 10 ppm, pH 3, [Fe(II)] = 0.2 mM, [H2O2] = 2 mM.

In the same conditions, an experiment was carried out to
assess
the possible production of acridine as the byproduct of CBZ transformation.
Acridine is a mutagenic compound that has been observed as the byproduct
of the photochemical transformation of CBZ in natural waters (see
Figure 1-SI in the Supporting Information, hereafter SI, for a likely pathway of CBZ transformation into acridine).48 The monitoring of acridine is mandatory to understand
if the transformation of CBZ can produce a more hazardous compound
than the parent one in the studied Fenton conditions. The inset of Figure 2b shows the time
evolution of acridine, which was actually formed with a concentration
peak (9 × 10–8 M, i.e., 0.2% of the initial
4.2 × 10–5 M CBZ) that was reached in the first
minute of the reaction, before a progressive decrease down to zero
concentration. The observed time trend of acridine is of no concern
from an environmental point of view because (i) the peak concentration
was very low (≈0.2% of the initial CBZ) and (ii) acridine disappeared
at reaction time ≥20 min.

The Fenton degradation of CBZ
was then investigated in the presence
of three different organic macromolecules (HA, Alg, and BSA), to simulate
the occurrence of structurally very different compounds that are able
to scavenge the reactive transient species and that can be potentially
removed by NF. Therefore, the CBZ (Co =
10 ppm) time trends were monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations
of HA (from 5 to 120 ppm, Figure 3a), Alg (from 5 to 480 ppm, Figure 3b), and BSA (from 5 to 480 ppm, Figure 3c). In all the cases,
one observes an inhibition of CBZ degradation as the concentration
of the scavenger increases, most likely as a consequence of the increasing
consumption of the reactive transient species (e.g., •OH) that are thus subtracted to the reaction with CBZ.

Figure 3 Time trend
of CBZ [Co = 10 ppm, pH
3 by H2SO4, H2O2 2 mM,
Fe(II) 0.2 mM] in the presence of increasing amounts of HA (A), Alg
(B), and BSA (C).

The inhibition effect
is strongly affected by the nature of the
macromolecule employed (HA > Alg > BSA), as shown by the fact
that
the inhibition carried out by 120 ppm HA was definitely more marked
compared to 480 ppm BSA or Alg (see Figure 3). The different extent of inhibition of
CBZ degradation carried out by HA, BSA, and Alg can be accounted for
by the structural properties of the three model interfering agents.
Alg is a polysaccharide with mainly aliphatic (sugar) chains, which
are known to react with •OH and similar oxidants
but with relatively slow kinetics compared to other functional groups.47 Aliphatic (amino-acidic) groups would also prevail
in the case of BSA that has only some aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine,
tyrosine, and tryptophan) able to react fast with the oxidizing species.
In contrast, HA has a large aromatic fraction that could warrant elevated
reactivity with •OH.47

In a following experimental series, we tested the NF–Fenton
performance in the presence of concentrations of scavengers that were
shown in the above experiments to produce an important inhibition
of CBZ degradation (80 ppm HA, 360 ppm Alg, and 240 ppm BSA). The
NF–Fenton results were then compared with those obtained with
Fenton alone, by carrying out the Fenton degradation experiments on
as-prepared solutions and on solutions after NF treatment. To achieve
extensive CBZ degradation under all the tested conditions, in this
series of experiments we made multiple additions of the Fenton reagent
and, particularly, one every 10 minutes. The advantage of making multiple
Fenton additions over using a larger amount of reagents right at the
beginning of the process is that by using each time lower concentration
values of Fe(II) and H2O2, one minimizes the
problems connected with •OH scavenging by the two
reactants, which becomes more important as their concentrations get
higher.49

Figure 4 shows the
CBZ time-trend profile in the presence of HA (Figure 4a), Alg (Figure 4b), and BSA (Figure 4c). In all the cases, the NF–Fenton
approach allowed for complete CBZ abatement (meaning that CBZ became
undetectable by HPLC) after the second addition of the Fenton reagent.
In contrast, the Fenton reaction alone without the NF pretreatment
step required a third addition of the reactants, and even in this
case a residual concentration of CBZ was observed at the end of the
treatment. This finding is in agreement with (i) the large rejections
of HA, Alg, and BSA carried out by NF (see Figure 1) and (ii) the important inhibition effect
carried out by HA, Alg, and BSA on the Fenton degradation of CBZ.
Therefore, as was expected, the preliminary NF elimination of the
interfering agents proved to significantly favor the following oxidation
step.

Figure 4 Time trend of CBZ (Co = 10 ppm) in
three-step experiments (pH 3 by H2SO4 and, for
each addition step, H2O2 2 mM + Fe(II) 0.2 mM),
in the presence of HA 80 ppm (A), Alg 360 ppm (B), and BSA 240 ppm
(C), observed on as-prepared solutions and after NF. First, second,
and third indicate the time of each subsequent addition of the Fenton
reagent.

NF–Fenton Coupling
To Achieve CBZ Degradation in Real
WWTP samples
Once demonstrated that the NF–Fenton
coupling can work well with synthetic solutions, we moved toward real
samples obtained from a wastewater treatment facility. The aim was
to investigate the behavior of wastewaters (whatever their origin,
either urban or industrial) that are rich in potential scavengers
of oxidizing species.

Negligible rejection of CBZ by NF was
observed on real samples as well, which confirms that the functioning
of our NF system was the same in both synthetic solutions and actual
wastewater. Figure 5 shows the time trends of CBZ (Co = 10
ppm) upon three subsequent additions of the Fenton reagent, carried
out on the Primary sample (sampled at the exit of
the primary clarifier, Figure 5a) and on the Secondary sample (obtained
at the exit of the secondary clarifier, Figure 5b), following both the NF–Fenton and
the Fenton-alone approaches. The results observed on the Primary
sample are very similar to those already reported in Figure 4 for the synthetic
interfering agents. Indeed, the NF pretreatment step allowed for a
considerable saving in the use of the Fenton reagent to degrade CBZ.
In the NF–Fenton case, the CBZ was in fact completely removed
after the second addition of Fenton, whereas after the third addition
of Fenton, a significant amount of residual CBZ (∼2 ppm) in
the Fenton-only treatment was observed.

Figure 5 Time trend of CBZ (Co = 10 ppm) in
three-step experiments (pH 3 by H2SO4 and, for
each addition step, H2O2 2 mM + Fe(II) 0.2 mM),
on Primary sample water (A) and Secondary
sample water (B), used both as is and after NF. First, second,
and third indicate the time of each subsequent addition of the Fenton
reagent.

Interestingly, the preliminary
NF step was able to remove ∼91%
of the organic material occurring in the Primary sample (having TOC = 21.5 mgC L–1 before NF),
thereby confirming the ability of loose NF to remove the scavengers
of the reactive species that occur in wastewater. In contrast, the
NF–Fenton performance was fully comparable with that of Fenton
alone with the Secondary sample, where in both cases
the second addition of Fenton reactants allowed for complete CBZ removal
(see Figure 5b). The
most likely explanation for this finding resides in the much lower
TOC value of the Secondary sample (1.9 mgC L–1) as compared to the Primary sample (21.5 mgC L–1).

Therefore, in
the case of the Secondary sample, there is no real
need of a preliminary NF step to eliminate interfering
organic compounds. For this reason, the following tests were carried
out on the Primary sample alone. Interestingly, the
NF step allowed for a significant overall improvement of the water
quality of the Primary sample, referred not only
to the TOC abatement but also to the decrease of the concentration
values of the main anions and cations (and of the conductivity as
a consequence), as well as of total nitrogen (TN) and total organic
nitrogen (TON). Table 1 shows the comparison between the main chemical parameters for the Primary Sample, before (S1) and after (S1–NF) the
NF treatment step.

At the explored reaction times, only the ferrous step of the Fenton
process was operational, which accounts for the steplike feature of
CBZ time evolution (Figure 5) and makes the Fe(II) salt a reagent more than a catalyst.
In real applications, one needs the tertiary treatment to work quickly,
and the fast ferrous step allowed for keeping treatment times below
10 min per addition. This is compatible with the time requirements
in the treatment of high flows of wastewater, while there would hardly
be time to wait that the slower ferric step contributes to CBZ degradation.

So far, the experiments were carried out with a rather high CBZ
concentration that required the use of high amounts of Fenton reagents.
To execute experiments that are more representative of a real-world
scenario, we gradually lowered the concentration of CBZ spiked to
the Primary sample water, from the original 10 to 0.5
ppm (i.e., from 42 to 2 μM). The comparison between NF–Fenton
(Figure 6a) and Fenton
alone (Figure 6b) under
low-concentration conditions suggests that NF–Fenton still
allows for more efficient CBZ removal compared to Fenton alone.

Figure 6 Time trend
of CBZ at different initial concentration values (Co decreasing from 10 down to 0.5 ppm, pH 3 by
H2SO4, H2O2 2 mM + Fe(II)
0.2 mM for each addition step) in the Primary sample water used as is (A) or after NF (B).

If the initial CBZ concentration is decreased, it makes sense
to
decrease as well the amounts of Fe(II) and H2O2 that are needed for the degradation, to avoid operating with excessively
high-concentration values that would negatively affect the process
costs. Therefore, several tests were carried out by progressively
lowering the concentration of both Fe(II) and H2O2 in the context of the NF–Fenton treatment (see Figure 7 for the observed CBZ time
trends). The use of 0.5 mM H2O2 + 0.05 mM Fe(II)
allowed for the CBZ concentration to be halved from the initial 0.5
ppm, and this result looks reasonable in the context of multiple Fenton
additions to limit the scavenging ability of both reactants. Therefore,
the final comparison between NF–Fenton and Fenton alone was
carried out in the presence of CBZ (Co = 0.5 ppm) at pH 3, with consecutive additions of Fe(II) and H2O2. The added amounts were such that after the
first addition, one had 0.5 mM H2O2 and 0.05
mM Fe(II).

3 by H2SO4) in water sampled after a primary
sedimentation tank (Primary sample), with different
concentrations of the Fenton reagent.

As shown in Figure 8, for Fenton alone one had still 10% of the initial CBZ after
the
fifth addition, whereas in the case of NF–Fenton, the same
result could be obtained with only two additions. This difference
between the performances of Fenton and NF–Fenton toward the Primary sample water was considered for the following economic
analysis of the treatment performance. Note that each degradation
was carried out in duplicate, with very good reproducibility.

and fifth indicate the time of each subsequent addition of the Fenton
reagent.

Cost Analysis
A comparison of costs associated with
Fenton-based oxidation alone or following pretreatment by NF was performed
to assess the feasibility of the proposed system. The present estimate
is based on the treatment of a unit flow rate of wastewater (1 m3 h–1), having similar characteristics as
the Primary sample used in this study. Note that
even if the cost analysis is strongly related to the type of water
to be treated and its output can change abruptly as a function of
its composition (e.g., the buffer capacity and/or the nature of the
organic scavengers), the methodology used here is of general validity
and can be applied to different kinds of wastewaters.

The target
CBZ degradation was 90% of the initial concentration, thereby leaving
10% residual CBZ after the treatment. As shown above, this abatement
value was achieved upon five additions of reagents when the primary
effluent was treated with Fenton alone and upon two additions in the
case of NF–Fenton (Figure 8). The wholesale cost of reagents was assumed, and
in particular, 240, 100, 500, and 120$ ton–1 for,
respectively, H2SO4 (96% purity), FeSO4·7H2O, H2O2 (50% solution in
water), and CaO (needed to neutralize the solution after Fenton oxidation).
The membrane chosen for the estimation of the capital and operational
costs of the system was the HydraCoRe70pHT 8040-46. On the basis of
the results of Figure 1, the flux of wastewater per unit applied pressure was assumed to
be 1.3 LMH bar–1, the recovery rate was chosen as
70% (70% of the stream recovered in the high-quality permeate and
30% in the concentrated retentate stream), and the applied pressure
was 10 bar.

The operational cost of the Fenton oxidation process
applied directly
downstream of the primary clarifier is $0.20 for each m3 of the treated water (see Figure 9b for the relevant treatment train and Table 1-SI for the detailed cost analysis).
The largest contributions to total costs derive from the addition
of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, accounting each for 40% of
the total reagent costs. Disposal of the neutralized effluent from
this step, containing high levels of organic material and iron, would
cost an additional 0.38$ m–3 based on the current
price of wastewater disposal in Italy.50 That yields a total cost of 0.58$ m–3 when Fenton
oxidation is applied directly downstream of the primary clarifier.
Interestingly, if one wants to upgrade a WWTP for CBZ abatement by
using the Fenton reaction after the primary effluent, the operational
costs would be increased by ∼50% that is a significant price
increase but not unsustainable, in particular, in the framework of
future legislation (and current one in Switzerland, for instance51,52) that will enforce the elimination of emerging contaminants from
wastewater.

Figure 9 Schematic of the hypothetical treatment trains assumed for the
assessment of treatment costs, with (A) or without (B,C) NF.

On the contrary, if the Fenton
reaction is conducted with the purified
permeate stream coming from the NF step (see Figure 9a and Table 1-SI), the reagent costs are reduced to 0.05$ m–3 (where the volume is referred to the total feed water).
It can be safely assumed that the amounts of organic material and
iron (after a sedimentation step) present in this effluent are low
enough to allow safe discharge into the receiving water body. Compared
to Fenton oxidation directly downstream of the primary clarifier,
the NF pretreatment allows for saving >75% of the Fenton costs.
The
reason is not only the lower (roughly halved) amount of the Fenton
reagent needed to carry out the oxidation but also the lower buffer
capacity of the permeate stream compared to the feed wastewater, caused
by the extensive removal of inorganic ions and organic carbon. The
lower buffer capacity does in fact entail a very significant decrease
of the amounts of H2SO4 and CaO that are required
to adjust pH before and after the Fenton process.

If the Fenton
process were to be applied directly to the effluent
of the secondary clarifier in scenario C, the target abatement value
would be reached with two additions of reagents (see Figure 5b). This can be ascribed to
the reduction in organic matter operated by the extensive treatment
prior to the oxidation step. The target CBZ abatement value (90%)
would require a total reagent cost of 0.07$ m–3,
including pH neutralization, equivalent to roughly 130% of the reagent
cost in the case of Fenton oxidation occurring downstream of the NF
pretreatment of the primary effluent in scenario A. The effluent from
the Fenton process in scenario C may be safely discharged to the receiving
water body.

One should not forget that a membrane plant has
significant installation
and operational costs that should be taken into account in the present
assessment. On the basis of the assumptions mentioned above, the treatment
of 1 m3 h–1 of wastewater requires 75
m2 of the active membrane. The installation costs of the
membrane plant per unit membrane area reported in the literature are
400$ m–2 for sufficiently large plants (>500
m2 of total membrane area), yielding a total installation
cost
of roughly $30 000 to treat the unit flow rate.53 Operational costs of the membrane system include the following:
(i) membrane replacement costs (replacement of the membrane every
3 years leads to an extra cost54 of approximately
0.02$ m–3); (ii) energy-associated costs: for a
pumping system with 70% efficiency and including energy recovery,
and for a cost of energy of 0.19$ kW h–1, the specific
costs to drive the separation55 are roughly
0.04$ m–3; (iii) costs for the disposal of the concentrate
stream (flow of 0.3 m3 h–1, namely, 30%
of the unit flow rate of wastewater), at 0.11$ per each m3 volume of the feed wastewater stream (i.e., 30% of the 0.38$ m–3 cost for wastewater disposal), and (iv) chemical
reagents for membrane cleaning (roughly 0.01$ m–3).54 As such, the total operational cost
of the system made up of NF followed by the Fenton reaction is estimated
to be approximately 0.23$ m–3. Therefore, total
operational savings would be $0.35 for each m3 of feed
water (i.e., 0.23$ m–3 against 0.58$ m–3), compared to a treatment train that includes a Fenton-based step
without NF. Therefore, the installation of a membrane system is justified
if the plant is to be operated for 10 years or longer.

Our estimations
did not consider the cost of the necessary sedimentation
to separate the solids produced during the neutralization step
after the Fenton reaction, whose amount is roughly proportional to
that of the reagents used and would thus be much higher in the scenario
without NF pretreatment.

In case B of Figure 9, the problem of iron is not so significant
because the effluent,
once neutralized after the Fenton reactor, enters in the active sludge
plant and the iron is blocked within the sludge and then treated in
the sludge line. In the other two cases (A and C), one needs to install
a further clarifier, but the sedimentation of iron at neutral pH is
not a technological challenge (the use of iron colloids is a common
strategy to promote the sedimentation of fine particles). Furthermore,
in a circular economy context, the opportunity to recycle the iron-rich
sludge as the raw material for certain industries (e.g., companies
producing pigments) could be considered.

Also, one of the factors
tipping the balance in favor of the membrane-based
process is the availability of space. The present estimates did in
fact not consider the clear advantage in the footprint of installing
a modular and compact membrane system compared to larger Fenton reactors,
larger biological tanks, and/or the necessary secondary clarifiers.

Conclusions
When
applied to a water matrix that was rich in the
scavengers of the reactive species, NF–Fenton performed significantly
better than Fenton alone in micropollutant (CBZ) degradation. The
reason is largely due to the NF ability to selectively remove scavengers
(HA, Alg, and BSA in synthetic solutions; TOC, ions, TN and TON in
actual wastewater), thereby facilitating the Fenton reaction. In contrast,
the coupling of Fenton with NF seems much less justified when operating
on matrices that contain fewer interfering agents.

The cost savings allowed by NF–Fenton compared
to Fenton alone are due to both lower levels of reactants (especially
H2O2) needed to degrade CBZ and (unexpectedly,
even more than that) to lower amounts of acids and bases required
for pH adjustment before and after the Fenton treatment.

The NF–Fenton approach can be applied to the
treatment of wastewaters characterized at the same time by high concentrations
of biodegradable agents and of biorecalcitrant micropollutants. In
this case, the wastewater effluent would be split by NF into two fractions,
that is, a NF retentate that is rich in biodegradable macropollutants
but has no micropollutants and a permeate that is poor in interfering
species but contains the micropollutants. These fractions can be treated
through two different processes (activated sludge vs Fenton, respectively),
thereby substantially enhancing the overall quality of the treated
wastewater in terms of both micro- and macropollutants. The treated
water has sufficiently high quality to enable its reuse in other human
activities, which might be interesting in a framework of water scarcity.

Because the use of NF–Fenton is only
justified
in the presence of high concentrations of the interfering species,
one needs an in-depth evaluation of the change of the NF permeation
ability at long working times (higher than those tested here), for
example, to properly assess the role of fouling on the overall features
of the NF membrane. Fouling could be very significant with urban wastewater
having an elevated bacterial load, but it could be less problematic
with industrial wastewater.



Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All the compounds employed in
this work were of analytical grade, and they were used without any
further purification step. Water used was of Milli-Q quality (TOC
<2 ppb, resistivity ≥18 MΩ cm). The reagents acetonitrile
(gradient grade), methanol (gradient grade), H3PO4 (85 w/w %), BSA (≥96%), CBZ (≥98%), NaOH (≥99%),
H2O2 (30 w/w % in water), HA sodium salt (technical
grade), and Alg were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; H2SO4 (95–97%) and FeSO4 × 7 H2O (≥99.5%) were from Merck.

Real Wastewater Samples
The real wastewater samples
were provided by SMAT S.p.A. (Società Metropolitana Acque Torino,
Italy) and were sampled at the wastewater treatment facility of Castiglione
Torinese (Italy) on 3 November 2017. The WWTP of Castiglione Torinese
is one of the largest such facilities in Italy, and it provides wastewater
treatment services for a potential population equivalent of 3.9 million
inhabitants. In this plant, the wastewater stream undergoes the common
treatment steps usually implemented in urban WWTPs: after the physical
treatments (coarse-and-fine materials separation, grit removal, deodorization,
and oil and grease removal) that eliminate most suspended solids and
approximately one-third of the original organic carbon, the flow enters
into a primary clarifier tank after which the water is subjected to
denitrification and to a biological oxidative step before the secondary
sedimentation. The water outflowing the secondary clarifier tank is
eventually disinfected and released into the acceptor body (the River
Po). The samples used in this work were obtained from the outflow
of the primary clarifier tank (Primary sample) and
of the secondary clarifier tank (Secondary sample). Real samples were used after a rough prefiltration step, carried
out through a grade 1 qualitative filter paper (Whatman) to remove
large suspended solids.

Membrane
The membrane used in the
experiments was HydraCoRe70
(abbreviated as Hydra70) purchased from Hydranautics, Nitto Denko
Group. This membrane consists of a thin separation layer made of highly
negatively charged sulfonated polyethersulfone. This layer is chemically
stable at pH 2–13, and it rejects salts in the order Na2SO4 > NaCl > MgSO4 > MgCl2 > CaCl2, as certified by the manufacturer.
Our experiments
showed a water permeance of 4.0 LMH bar–1) and an
observed rejection of roughly 80% for NaCl and MgSO4, when
the feed solution contained 30 mM of each single salt at pH 7.6. The
solute separation capability of Hydra70 is provided by a combination
of size exclusion and charge exclusion governed by the Donnan effect.
This membrane may thus be described as a loose NF membrane, and it
is usually applied in processes such as industrial or urban wastewater
treatment, as well as surface- or well-water purification.

Membrane
Filtration System
All separation experiments
were performed using a cross-flow lab-scale unit. The unit comprises
a high-pressure pump (Hydra-cell pump, Wanner Engineering, Inc., Minneapolis,
MN), a membrane housing cell, a recirculating chiller for temperature
control (model MC 1200, Lauda) connected to a stainless steel coil
immersed in the feed tank, and a data acquisition system. The housing
cell consists of a 7.9 cm long, 2.9 cm wide, and 0.3 cm high rectangular
channel. The active area of the membrane sample is thus 23 cm2. The cross-flow rate was monitored by a floating disk rotameter
and adjusted, along with the operating pressure, by means of a bypass
valve and a back-pressure regulator (Swagelok, Solon, OH). The permeate
flow rate was continuously measured throughout the experiments using
an in-line flow sensor (Sensirion, Switzerland). The permeate and
the retentate streams were recirculated back to the feed reservoir,
and samples were collected from the recirculation lines.

Membrane Filtration
Tests
Tests Using Synthetic Feed Solutions
Tests were performed
after 5 h of membrane compaction at 300 psi (20.7 bar) with ultrapure
water as the feed solution. The cross-flow rate was set at 4.5 L min–1 (cross-flow velocity of 0.85 m s–1) and the temperature of the feed solution at 22 °C. Each test
started by adjusting the operating pressure at 100 psi (6.9 bar).
At the steady state, the permeate flow values were measured for about
20 min to calculate pure water permeance. It followed the addition
of solutes, organic substances, and/or CBZ to the feed solution, to
obtain the desired feed mixture. Except for the tests performed to
evaluate the influence of the ionic strength, the feed solutions contained
a mixture of salts including 0.45 mM KH2PO4,
9.20 mM NaCl, 0.61 mM MgSO4, 0.5 NaHCO3, 0.5
mM CaCl2, and 0.935 mM NH4Cl, thus yielding
a total ionic strength of 14.7 mM (Visual MINTEQ 3.0). Except for
tests conducted to assess the influence of pH, the pH of the feed
solution was fixed at a value of 7.4. The pH was adjusted by the addition
of small amounts of H2SO4 or NaOH. When applicable,
one type of organic macromolecule for each separate experiment, that
is, HA, Alg, or BSA, was added to the feed solution to reach a concentration
of 80, 360, or 240 mg L–1, respectively. These concentrations
were chosen based on preliminary inhibition tests performed on the
Fenton degradation of CBZ. The concentration of CBZ in the feed solution
was 10 mg L–1. Each change in the composition of
the feed solution was followed by a 45 min step aimed at ensuring
that a new steady state was reached, before sampling the permeate
and the concentrate streams for further analyses, for degradation
tests, and to measure TOC and CBZ rejection.

Tests Using Effluent Wastewater
Filtrations were run
at an applied pressure of 300 psi (20.7 bar). Two types of filtration
runs were conducted: (i) filtration of a sample as is and (ii) filtration
of a sample with the addition of 10 mg L–1 CBZ.
The permeate flux was monitored throughout the experiment to assess
the decline because of membrane compaction and possible fouling. Concentrate
and permeate samples were collected starting from the second hour
and used for further degradation experiments, as well as to measure
TOC and CBZ rejection.

Thermal Fenton Degradation Tests
For the synthetic
water samples, CBZ solutions to be subjected to the thermal Fenton
reaction were prepared at the desired concentration of Fe(II) (added
as FeSO4 × 7H2O), pH (adjusted by H2SO4) and, if applicable, added with different concentrations
of reactive species scavengers (HA, BSA, and Alg). In the experiments
on effluent samples, the desired amount of CBZ was spiked to the sample
to obtain the desired concentration.

Samples (total volume 50
mL) were mechanically stirred in an air-open beaker during the reaction,
which started when H2O2 was added to the sample
(reaction time tr = 0). At selected time
intervals, precisely measured 0.5 mL aliquots were withdrawn from
the reaction system and diluted with 0.5 mL methanol to quench the
Fenton reaction. Afterward, the diluted solutions underwent HPLC analysis.
Some degradation tests were carried out through multiple additions
of the same amount of the Fenton reagent every 10 min, with the aim
of reaching complete CBZ degradation.

Analytical Determinations
The solutions of CBZ were
always produced from saturated stock solutions prepared in ultrapure
water. The concentration of the stock was checked daily by spectrophotometry
at 285 nm, using a UV/vis SPECORD S 600 instrument equipped with 1
cm cuvettes (Suprasil Quartz, Hellma). The CBZ time trends were monitored
with an YL HPLC system 9300, equipped with an YL9330 Column Compartment,
an YL9150 autosampler, and a spectrophotometric single-wavelength
detector set at 200 nm. The chromatographic separations were carried
out with a RP-C18 LiChroCART-LiChrospher cartridge (250 mm ×
4 mm, particle size 5 μm) in isocratic mode (70% H3PO4 in water at pH 2.8, 30% acetonitrile, total flow rate
1 mL min–1). In these conditions, the CBZ retention
time was 7.8 min, with a column dead time of 0.7 min. Mutagenic acridine
is by far the most problematic of the transformation intermediates
arising from the oxidation of CBZ.48 The
determination of acridine as the byproduct of the Fenton transformation
of CBZ was carried out with the same chromatographic system, but by
using as eluents MeOH (A) and phosphate buffer 10 mM at pH 7.3 (B).
The elution was carried out at A/B = 50:50 for the first 8 min, and
then the conditions changed in 1 min to A/B = 60:40 and stayed stable
up to 20 min (retention time for acridine 16.9 min).

TOC and
TN were measured with a Shimadzu ON-LINE TOC-VCSH instrument, equipped
with an ASI-V autosampler and fed with zero-grade air (Gruppo Sapio,
Italy). The TOC concentration was obtained as the difference between
the total carbon (TC) and the inorganic carbon (IC). The TN determination
was based on the quantitative catalytic conversion of the inorganic
and organic nitrogen into nitrogen oxide (NO), quantified with a chemiluminescence
detector. The calibrations were carried out with previously dehydrated
primary standards: K2CO3 for IC, potassium hydrogen
phthalate for TC, and KNO3 for TN.

The retention
ability of the membrane was also evaluated for the
main cations and anions in the real Primary sample. Anions (Cl–, NO2–, NO3–, SO42–, PO43–) and cations (Na+, NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) were determined with a Dionex DX 500 ion chromatograph
equipped with a gradient pump GP40, an electrochemical suppression
unit (ASRS 300 for anions and CERS 500 for cations), an ED40 detector,
and a Rheodyne injector (100 μL injection loop). The separation
columns used were Dionex Ion Pac AS9-HC with an AG9-HC guard column
for the anions and Dionex CS12A with a CG12A guard column for the
cations. The used eluents were 9 mM K2CO3 (anions)
and 20 mM methanesulfonic acid (cations). In both cases, the total
flow rate was 1 mL min–1. The pH and the conductivity
of the solutions were measured, respectively, with a Multi 340i pH
meter (WTW Measurement Systems Inc.) and with a Microcomputer Conductivity
meter model 131 (Analytical Control).
