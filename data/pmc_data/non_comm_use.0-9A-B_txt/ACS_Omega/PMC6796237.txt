Hepatitis
C virus (HCV) is a human pathogen with high morbidity.
The HCV NS3/4A protease is essential for viral replication and is
one of the top three drug targets. Several drugs targeting the protease
have been developed, but drug-resistant mutant strains emerged. Here,
we screened a library and synthesized a novel class of small molecules
based on a tryptophan derivative scaffold identified as HCV NS3/4A
protease inhibitors that are active against both wild type and mutant
form of the protease. Only the compounds with predicted binding poses
not affected by the most frequent mutations in the active site were
selected for experimental validation. The antiviral activities were
evaluated by replicon and enzymatic assays. Twenty-two compounds were
found to inhibit HCV with EC50 values ranging between 0.64
and 63 μM with compound 22 being the most active.
In protease assays, 22 had a comparable inhibition profile
for the common mutant HCV GT1b D168A and the wild-type enzyme. However,
in the same assay, the potency of the approved drug, simeprevir, decreased
5.7-fold for the mutant enzyme relative to the wild type. The top
three inhibitors were also tested against four human serine proteases
and were shown to be specific to the viral protease. The fluorescence-based
cell viability assay demonstrated a sufficient therapeutic range for
the top three candidates.

==== Body
Introduction
An estimated 170 million
people around the world are infected with
hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is transmitted through patient exposure
to infected blood. Without treatment, chronic HCV infection can cause
serious liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
According to the World Health Organization record, approximately 400 000
deaths occur annually because of HCV-related complications, making
it a serious health threat.1−3 The nonstructural proteins of
HCV play important roles in the viral production and replication.
Three viral proteins, namely, NS3/4A serine protease, NS5A IFN resistance
protein, and NS4B polymerase, are the major drug targets for the existing
antiviral therapeutics.4−6

The NS3/4A protease is responsible for selective
cleavage of polyproteins
into individual viral proteins (NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B).7 The first NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitors, boceprevir
and telaprevir, approved in 2011, were prescribed to patients with
genotype 1 (GT1) viral strain along with pegylated interferon alpha
(PEG-IFN∝) and ribavirin. A second generation of orally available
NS3/4 HCV protease inhibitor simeprevir (Olysio, Sovriad) and nucleoside
analogue NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) received FDA
approval in 2013.8,9 Between 2013 and 2016, several
noncovalent peptidomimetic protease inhibitors including linear (asunaprevir),
P1–P3 macrocyclic compounds (danoprevir,
simeprevir, and paritaprevir), and P2–P4 macrocyclic compounds (vaniprevir and grazoprevir) were also approved
in combination with NS5A interferon resistance inhibitor and/or NS5B
polymerase inhibitor.10−17 For these inhibitors, P1, P2, P3, and P4 correspond to the substrate amino acid side-chain
equivalents in the inhibitor that interact with the S1,
S2, S3, and S4 substrate binding
pockets of the protease, respectively.

There are six well-characterized
HCV genotypes (GT1–GT6),
and the P2–P4 macrocyclic compounds have
broad cross-genotype specificity.1 Although
GT1 is the most studied and targeted genotype,18 several common mutants of the HCV protease have emerged,
which include Q80K/R, R155K/Q, A156T, and D168A/V/T/H.19,20 These mutations are in the S2 and S4 pockets17,20−22 and may cause drug resistance. Several studies have
shown that these single amino acid substitutions confer the resistance
to all linear, P1–P3 macrocyclic, and
P2–P4 macrocyclic compounds.21−26 The most prevalent mutants causing drug resistance to all the current
NS3/4A-targeting drugs are D168A and R155K.19

In this study, we chose a subpocket to reduce mutation-related
drug resistance, three-dimensional (3D) modeling, computational docking,
cell-based assays, and enzymatic assays to identify compounds that
inhibit both the wild-type NS3/4A protease and the D168A mutant. This
was achieved by optimizing the binding efficiency to S1 and S3 pockets within the HCV NS3/4 protease active site
and avoiding the S2 and S4 pockets used by the
current drugs and susceptible to mutations. The screening, identification,
synthesis, and activity validation of compounds from the UC San Diego
CDIPD library against the GT1 wild-type virus and the HCV protease
D168A virus resulted in new promising candidates with desired properties.

Results
and Discussion
Identification of a Druggable Binding Pocket
on HCV NS3/4A
HCV NS3/4 protease inhibitors that are approved
or in clinical
trials are effective against the wild-type GT1 strain, but mutations
close to S2 and S4 pockets, in particular, R155K
and D168A17,20,21 (see Figure 1), significantly
reduce the efficacy of these drugs. The X-ray crystal structure of
NS3/4A from GT1a wt strain shows that the pocket conformation is relatively
stable in part because of the inter-side-chain interactions between
R155, D168, and R123. The side chains of R155 and D168 provide a substrate-friendly
surface for the P2 moiety of peptidomimetic protease inhibitors.27,28 Therefore, mutations of either of these amino acids affect the P2–S2 interactions and drug binding.28 The X-ray crystal structures of R155K, A156T,
or D168A mutants clearly illustrate this mechanism.27 In particular, the D168A mutation occurs frequently in
viruses that have been treated with inhibitors that bind to S2 or an adjacent S4 patch. This mutation reduces
the efficacy of drugs such as the linear inhibitor (asunaprevir) P1–P3 macrocyclic compounds (danoprevir, simeprevir,
and paritaprevir), and P2–P4 macrocyclic
compounds (vaniprevir and grazoprevir).11−17

Figure 1 Binding
poses of compounds from class A, B, and C in the HCV GT1a
NS3/4A crystal structure represented by molecular surface colored
by the side-chain types (PDB code 5EQR).29 Binding
mode from class A and class B have interactions in drug resistance
susceptible subpockets S2 and S4, while class
C compounds show preferred interaction with the receptor.

Because the S2 and S4 pockets are known
as
multidrug resistance sites, our goal was to discover a new class of
small-molecule inhibitors that bind to the active site of the HCV
protease but have no interactions with the S2 and S4 pockets. A model based on high-resolution co-crystal structure
of HCV NS3/4A GT1a/GT3a protease (PDB code: 5EQR)29 was mutated to the wild-type sequence (L132I, Q168D), converted
to fully protonated models, and optimized. The selection of HCV NS3/4A
crystal structure as the docking simulation receptor was based on
the high-resolution, well-defined active site surrounded by secondary
S1 and S3 pockets. The obtained models were
used for virtual ligand screening with the Molsoft ICM software30,31 against the structures of 26 743 compounds that are available
at the UC San Diego Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic
Diseases (CDIPD).

For each compound, the binding free energy
with the active site
of HCV was estimated,31 and these docking
scores were used for ranking. The docking scores were only calculated
for compounds that interact with the catalytic triad of H57, D81,
and S139 and with the nearby residues. By setting the threshold score
at −32 (arbitrary units), we identified three classes of candidate
compounds likely to bind to the active site of the target enzyme (Figure 1). Within these classes,
related compounds had consistent docking poses. For class A molecules,
we selected five compounds with docking scores ranging from −38
to −32 (Table S1). These molecules
contain N-phenylsulfonamide or aminosulfonamide functional
groups that were predicted to interact with the S1, S2, and S3 pockets. For class B molecules, two compounds
with docking scores ranging from −34 to −32 were selected
(Table S2). These compounds bind to the
active site of the HCV protease in a different orientation from the
class A molecules and primarily interact with S1, S3, and S4 pockets. They consist of phenyl imidazolidine
or phenyl triazolidin. The docking poses of compounds from these two
classes show interactions with either the S2 pocket (class
A) or the S4 pocket (class B) and are therefore not ideal
compounds for perusing biochemical and cell-based studies using a
protease with mutations in both the S2 and S4 pockets.

The class C molecules contain a tryptophan derivative
scaffold
that binds to a smaller patch compared to the class A and class B
molecules. Importantly, the 14 molecules in this class (1–14) do not interact with the S2 and S4 pockets
of HCV protease. They primarily bind to the S1 and S3 pockets (Figure 1) and have binding scores ranging from −32 to −38.
Within the library of 26 743 compounds, we selected five additional
compounds that were structurally similar to the members of the class
C group (15–19); however, their binding scores
were below the −32 cutoff. These compounds were selected for
the downstream cell-based studies. In addition, libraries of commercially
available compounds were searched for class C-related structures,
docked and scored. From this search, we found a compound with high
structural similarity and a lower binding score of −40. For
our studies, we named this compound as analogue 20 (Table 1) (Figure 2).

One important feature of this class of compounds is
the ureido
group that connects the core structure and R1 group. A
bidentate bond between the two secondary amines of the ureido group
with the carbonyl oxygen of R155 backbone (Figure 3) stabilizes the ligand–enzyme interaction.
In GT1a drug resistance mutants such as R155K and D168A, there are
no salt bridges between the R155, D168, and R123 triads; thus, an
additional backbone stabilization of R155 may be needed for a strong
binding of the inhibitor to the mutant. The docking poses of superimposed
structures of 20 compounds in NS3/4 GT1a (Figure S1) show consistency of binding modes among the compounds in
this class. Substituted R2 and indole groups of class C
compounds are predicted to have interactions in the S1 and
S3 subpockets, the main targeted pockets, in HCV protease
active site. In addition, the H57 residue is involved in pi-stacking
(3.78 Å) interactions with the substituted aromatic rings in
R1 for all the 20 inhibitors.

bonding interactions are shown as dashed green and orange lines. Pi-stacking

The 20 compounds from class C were tested in vivo for inhibition
of viral replication (GT1b wt) in BM4-5 FEO cells and for mammalian
cell cytotoxicity. The number of virus particles was evaluated by
quantifying the luciferase produced during the virus life cycle,32 while toxicity was evaluated using a cell viability
assay. For viral replication, the 48 h EC50 of these compounds
ranged from 0.64 to 63.44 μM (Table 1), while the 48 h cell toxicity ranged from
2.24 μM to more than 100 μM. Prior to additional biochemical
studies, several key chemical properties for each of the class C molecules
were determined. The polar surface area (PSA), the predicted lipophilicity
(clog P), and the molecular weight for each compound
(Table 1) were in agreement
with the general criteria for drug-like molecules.

The efficacy
and toxicity of class C compounds were found to be
diverse with the therapeutic index, defined as the ratio of 50% lethal
concentration for uninfected to 50% viral growth inhibition concentration
of infected cells, for antiviral activity relative to cell toxicity
ranging from 0.3 to 31. We were interested in pursuing biochemical
studies for compounds 1 and 12, the two
candidates with the highest therapeutic index. These compounds also
had favorable properties, such as molecular weight, water solubility
PSA, and permeability within an acceptable range for a drug-like molecule.

Design of New Compounds for Improved Binding to HCV Protease
In compounds 1 and 12, the R2 functional group consisted of 1-propyl-2-methyl-piperidine. On the
basis of the predicted docking poses, removal of the methyl group
was expected to improve the interaction between the catalytic triad
and the adjacent residues in the HCV protease active site. Therefore,
we designed analogues of compounds 1 and 12 that lacked the methyl group at R2 and called them compounds 21 and 22, respectively. The binding score of 21 was unchanged from 1 (both −38), while
the binding score of 22 was slightly better than 12 (−34 vs −33) (Table 2). The lowest energy binding pose of compound 22 in the active site of HCV NS3/4A is shown in Figure 4.

Synthesis of Compounds 21 and 22
As highlighted in Scheme 1, the tryptophan-derived HCV NS3/4 protease
inhibitors, 21 and 22, were synthesized
starting from 3-(piperidine-1-yl)propan-1-amine
(23), which could be accessed in two steps from commercially
available N-(bromopropyl)phtalimide and piperidine,
and N-Boc-protected l-tryptophan (24). Thus, the HBTU-mediated coupling of 25 and 24, followed by N-Boc deprotection and carbamoylation
reaction with the appropriate isocyanate, provided the desired compounds, 21 and 22. These test compounds were characterized
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS. In addition, the
experimental pKa values, lipophilicity
(clog P), and log D7.4 of 22 were determined via potentiometric titrations
using a Sirius T3 instrument. Compounds 21 and 22, as well as the 20 compounds from the primary screen, were
then tested in cell-based assays to evaluate activity against HCV
and toxicity to the host cells (Table 2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 21 and 22
Evaluation of Compounds in Viral Replication
Assays and HCV
Protease Activity Assays
Compounds 21 and 22 were evaluated in the HCV replicon assay and for cytotoxicity
using BM4-5 FEO cells. Compound 21 had slightly weaker
antiviral activity than 1 but lower cytotoxicity; therefore,
the therapeutic index was unchanged for these two analogues. The IC50 value for compound 22 was 2-fold more potent
than the related compound 12 and the cytotoxicity was
unchanged. Therefore, the therapeutic index for 22 improved
2-fold over 12 from 30.6 to 73.4.

In order to validate
that this group of molecules elicit their cellular effects via inhibition
of the viral protease, we incubated compounds 1, 12, and 22 with recombinant NS3/4A protease GT1b
and an inhibitor-resistant mutant containing a D168A mutation. D168
is located in the S2 and S4 subpockets, and
mutations in these subpockets can cause significant resistance to
the inhibitors, resulting in decreased activity of peptidomimetic
inhibitors.3,33,34 The enzyme activity was evaluated using a fluorogenic peptide substrate,
Ac-Glu-Glu-Val-Val-Ala-Cys-AMC, that has previously been described
as a HCV protease substrate.35 No enzyme
assays were performed with compound 21 because it showed
no improvement in antiviral activity or selectivity when compared
to the parent molecule, 1. As a control, potency was
evaluated with an approved HCV protease inhibitor, simeprevir.

Figure 5 HCV NS3/4A protease inhibition assay. Dose response curve of 22 with HCV protease GT1b wt (A) and D168A mutant (B) derived
from the relative fluorescence absorption that represents the concentration
of the cleavage products of fluorogenic peptide substrate (Ac-Glu-Glu-Val-Val-Ala-Cys-AMC)
at 60 μM by GT1b wt protease or by the D168A mutant in the presence
of 22 at inhibitor concentrations between 0.625 and 40
μM; the errors calculated from three measurements at each concentration.

The HCV protease was incubated with 0.625–40
μM of
compounds 1, 12, and 22 and
the IC50 values were calculated. These studies show that
the wt protease activity is directly inhibited by compounds derived
from the tryptophan scaffold. The potency of compound 22 was lower than simeprevir (IC50 4.60 μM vs 0.043
μM) (Table 3);
however, when inhibition was evaluated using the D168A mutant, the
potency of simeprevir decreased by 5.7-fold, while no significant
reduction of potency was observed for compound 22 (Figure 5). Likewise, compounds 1 and 12 that showed high efficiency and acceptable
toxicity profile from the HCV replicon assay were assayed with wt and mutant HCV protease and found
to have no significant change in potency. Therefore, our initial prediction
that these tryptophan-containing inhibitors do not interact with the
S2 and S4 subpockets is likely to be correct.
Other HCV protease inhibitors, such as glecaprevir, paritaprevir,
and grazoprevir, have been shown to have 4-fold to 154-fold reduced
potency in cell-based assays when comparing the wild-type viruses
with viruses that have a mutation at D168.36

a The identified compounds inhibit
both the wild type and the D168A mutant form of protease at similar
IC50 values.

To determine the HCV NS3/4A selectivity of compounds 1, 12, and 22, we assayed these analogues
with trypsin, elastase, and chymotrypsin at the HCV IC50 concentrations. In addition, we tested these compounds for inhibition
against the fungal serine protease, proteinase K that is structurally
related to several mammalian serine proteases such as the proprotein
convertases.37 Using a concentration of
40 nM for each enzyme, we found that 13.08 and 14.68, 4.60 μM
of 1, 12, and 22, respectively,
did not decrease the activity of trypsin, elastase, chymotrypsin,
and proteinase K significantly, while, at this concentration, these
three compounds decreased HCV NS3/4A activity by about 50% (Figure 6). Taken together,
these data indicate that compounds with the tryptophan scaffold derivative
were selective from the viral protease over other serine proteases.

Figure 6 HCV protease
selectivity of top three compounds against four human
serine proteases. Counter-screening on of 1, 12, and 22 at 13.08, 14.68, 4.60 μM, respectively,
to 40 nM concentration of HCV NS3/4A, trypsin, elastase, chymotrypsin,
and proteinase K shows high HCV-NS3-specificity of 1, 12, and 22 inhibitors.

Conclusions
In this study, we identified and synthesized
a new class of inhibitors
of HCV protease that shows similar potency for the wild-type and D168A
mutant enzymes. The inhibitory activity against the mutant was achieved
by targeting subpockets not affected by the D168A mutation. The compounds
were dissimilar to the common HCV protease inhibitors that contained
groups mimicking P1, P2, P3, and
P4 substrate side chains. In particular, 22 had an EC50 of 0.64 μM in a viral replication assay
and an LC50 of 47 μM for mammalian cells, resulting
in an overall therapeutic index of 73.4. This compound directly inhibited
the protease with IC50 = 4.60 μM and no significant
reduction if potency occurred when assayed with the D168A mutant.
Three of the top compounds were tested against a panel of four nonviral
serine proteases and no significant inhibition was noted. The new
NS3/4A protease inhibitors are promising development candidates for
treatment of emerging drug-resistant HCV strains.

Replicon Construct
The BM4-5 replicon
is a subgenomic
HCV GT1b replicon that contains adaptive mutation of serine in the
NS5A region.32,39 The firefly luciferase gene was
added into the BM4-5 replicon to generate BM4-5 FEO replicon. The
construction procedures have been previously described.40

Luciferase Antiviral Efficacy and Cell Viability
Assays
The BM4-5 FEO replicon of approximately 10 000
cells in 100
μL of medium was seeded into 96-well plates and incubated for
6 h for attachment. Then, the compounds were added to the wells in
a specific concentration and incubated for 48 h. The luciferase assay
(Bright-Glo; Promega) was carried out according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The luciferase activity was determined using a microplate
luminometer (Veritas microplate luminometer; Turner Biosystems). For
cell viability assays, BM4-5 FEO at the density of 10 000 cells
in 100 μL medium was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h for attachment,
and then the compounds were added and incubated for another 48 h.
The number of living cells was measured by Cell Titer-blue assay (Promega).
The fluorescence absorption (560Ex/590Em) for
a 96-well plate was read by Benchmark Scientific MR9600. The activity
and toxicity of each compound were measured by at least six different
concentrations in triplicate.

Plasmid Construction and
Purification of HCV NS3/A Protein
The drug-resistant mutant
D168A was generated by mutagenesis using
NS3-containing recombinant plasmid (pETDuet-1 Hepatis C Virus NS3/4A,
a gift from Michael Johnson, Addgene plasmid #16196) as a template.
The single mutation of aspartic acid (D) to alanine (A) was introduced
by mutagenesis at position 168 using specific primers (forward: 5′-GTTGCCAAAGCCGTTGCTTTCGTTCCGGTGGAA-3′
and reverse: 5′-TTCCACCGGAACGAAAGCAACGGCTTTGGCAAC-3′).
The overexpression and purification were preformed following the method
previously described.41 Rosetta 2(DE3)
cells (Novagen) containing the modified recombinant plasmid with a
histidine tag were grown in a lysogeny broth medium. The overexpression
was introduced by addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
to the final concentration of 0.5 mM and the bacteria were incubated
at room temperature for 16 h. The cell pellet was lysed by sonication
in buffer A [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5
mM β-mercaptoethanol (β-MCE), 0.2% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol,
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)]. The solution was
passed through an Ni-NTA column and washed by buffer B (50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, 5 mM β-MCE, 0.2% Triton
X-100, and 15% glycerol). The His-tag-fused protein was eluted by
buffer C (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 5 mM
β-MCE, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 15% glycerol), followed by dialysis
using buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, and 500 mM NaCl). Purified NS3/4A
protein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into buffer D (50 mM
HEPES, pH 7.6, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-MCE, 0.2% Triton X-100, and
50% glycerol) using a protein concentrator 10k (Amicon)

HCV NS3/4A
Enzymatic Inhibition Assay
The activities
of two proteases (recombinant HCV NS3/4A GT1b wt and full-length HCV
NS3/4A GT1b D168A) were measured using a fluorogenic substrate, Ac-Glu-Glu-Val-Val-Ala-Cys-AMC
(Sigma-Aldrich), where AMC corresponds to 7-amino-4-methylcourmarin.
Assays were performed in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mM NaCl, 0.01% Triton
X-100, and 10 mM dithiothreitol in a black 384-well microplate (BD
Falcon). The final concentrations of the enzyme, substrate, and DMSO
were 40 nM, 60 μM, and 2.5%, respectively, in a total volume
of 30 μL. Fluorescence was monitored at excitation and emission
wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively, in a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (BioTek). Data were visualized using Gen5 Software
(BioTek). The activity of the enzyme was calculated from the change
in relative fluorescence units over time. For inhibition assays, compounds
were preincubated with the enzyme for 240 min prior to adding the
enzyme/inhibitor mixture to the substrate. All assays were performed
in triplicate wells.

Counter-Screening Assay
Counter-screening
assays were
performed with 40 nM bovine trypsin (Sigma), pig pancreatic elastase
(Sigma), human chymotrypsin, and proteinase K, and 60 μM of
the appropriate fluorogenic substrates for trypsin, elastase, chymotrypsin,
and proteinase K are Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-AMC (trypsin), Me-Arg-Arg-Pro-Val-AMC
(elastase), and Suc-Arg-Arg-Pro-Phe-AMC (chymotrypsin and proteinase
K). Assays were performed in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mM NaCl, and
0.01% Triton X-100 in black 96-well microplates (BD Falcon) at a final
volume of 50 μL. The final concentration of DMSO in each well
was 2.5%. Fluorescence was measured as outlined above.

Computational
Modeling
Docking screening was performed
by docking an in-house library of approximately 27 000 small
molecules and ranked based on their docking scores, which represent
Gibbs free energy.30 The algorithm for
conformational sampling 3D structures of ligands and pockets is generated
randomly by biased probability Monte Carlo.31 All scoring functions and pharmacokinetic property predictions were
performed by the method implemented in ICM-Pro v3.8.
