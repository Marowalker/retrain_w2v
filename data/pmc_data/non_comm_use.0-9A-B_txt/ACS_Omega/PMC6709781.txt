We developed a spinning approach
for a dope produced by treating
softwood pulp with a deep eutectic solvent (DES). The DES enables
formation of a sufficiently viscous spinnable gel-like suspension
of fibers, which solidifies upon the removal of the DES. This solidification,
however, requires a longer time compared to most conventional wet
spinning processes. Consequently, the continuity of the spinning process
has been constrained in previous work. Moreover, the ability to draw
the incipient yarn to increase orientation has been limited. Here
we present a continuous spinning approach where the fiber yarn properties
and processability can be improved using an inclined channel. A combination
of an air gap and an inclined ethanol stream transports and draws
the incipient fiber yarn during spinning. The influence of syringe
tip diameter, angle of the channel, ethanol flow rate, and twisting
were studied experimentally. The improvements in the spinning process
resulted in an increase in load bearing capability and ability to
reduce the linear density of the fiber yarn.

Introduction
Environmental issues
such as the accumulation of microplastics
in the marine environment1,2 and carbon emissions
from production of plastic goods3 have
been ushering material research into bio-based options for the past
decades. In the context of fibers and yarn, exploration of new raw
materials is essential as their demand is expected to dramatically
increase because of the global increase in both population and prosperity.4 Arguably, cellulose-derived and based materials
are among the most potential candidates to meet this future demand.

Numerous spinning technologies and approaches have been developed
for cellulose-derived and based raw materials to form them into various
fibers, filaments, and yarns. While a plethora of different options
exist, spinning approaches for forming low-aspect-ratio native cellulose
fibers directly into monofilaments or staple fibers without dissolution
lack commercial adoption. To lower the barrier for commercial development
and adoption, research of new continuous spinning approaches and machinery
is necessary.

Cellulose-based yarns are typically manufactured
either from natural
or regenerated fibers. Naturally high-aspect-ratio fibers such as
cotton or flax are spun into yarn retaining the natural fiber structure
by using carding and, for example, ring or rotor spinning.5 In brief, the main issue with increasing the
production of most natural fibers is that it impinges on farming of
comestible crops.4

Several established
technologies exist to produce high-tenacity
regenerated cellulose fibers through dissolution and subsequent regeneration.
Dissolution of the natural cellulose fiber enables the use of lower-aspect-ratio
fibers such as pulp fibers as feedstock in the spinning process. Regenerated
cellulose fibers such as viscose have been prominent fibers on the
global market since the 1930s.6 Because
of the high cost of environmentally friendly production of viscose,
alternative dissolution routes such as the CarbaCell7,8 and BioCelSol9 process have been explored.
Non-derivatizing dissolution methods using for example N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide10 or ionic liquids11 have enabled production
of filaments with both a reduced environmental impact and improved
tensile properties.

Recently, spinning of native tensile components
of wood, namely
nanofibers and pulp fibers, has received scientific attention. Spinning
without dissolution preserves the native cellulose I structure, which
has a higher modulus and tensile strength compared to the cellulose
II structure in regenerated cellulose fibers.12−14 Furthermore,
omitting dissolution reduces the number of process steps in yarn or
filament production.

Several successful demonstrations of cellulose
nanofiber (CNF)
wet spinning15−22 and dry spinning23−25 have been reported. Specialized techniques, such
as flow focusing, have been utilized to achieve impressive tensile
strengths (490 MPa) and Young’s moduli (18 GPa).19 Flow focusing aligns the nanofibrils axially
within the filament. Such an alignment is typically achieved through
drawing, which is why most conventional solvent and melt spinning
techniques contain a drawing phase after the spinneret. Drawing improves
tensile strength and stiffness in both regenerated cellulose fibers26 and CNF filaments.17

In addition to CNF spinning, research has been conducted into
using
pulp fibers in spinning. Fiber yarn preparation without dissolution
using wood pulp as the main raw material has been demonstrated by
Tenhunen et al.,27 Spoljaric et al.,28 and Salmela et al.29 These structures are dissimilar to conventional cellulosic monofilaments
or yarns, and therefore, we refer to them as fiber yarns.

Tenhunen
et al.27 successfully spun
a wood fiber-based suspension into fiber yarn by pretreating the fibers
with a deep eutectic solvent (DES). DESs have similar physicochemical
qualities to ionic liquids and some of them, such as a choline chloride
and urea mixture (ChCl/urea), are biodegradable and have relatively
low toxicity and vapor emissions.30−33 The DES pretreatment of softwood
pulp fibers results in a stable gel-like spinnable suspension.27,34 In a further research, Tenhunen et al.35 researched the interaction of pulp fibers and ChCl/urea extensively.
They found that a ChCl/urea treatment (16 h at 100 °C) had no
significant influence on the pulp fiber structure. Furthermore, there
was no evidence of derivatization of the cellulose and only negligible
changes in monosaccharide contents.

In the context of spinning,
the DES keeps the wood fibers separate
which enables their extrusion into a yarn-shape. The resulting structure
solidifies when the DES is removed with a suitable solvent, such as
ethanol. Ethanol removes the DES without interrupting the bonding
between the cellulose fibers. To increase the poor water stability
of the natural cellulose fiber network, Tenhunen et al.27 cross-linked the cellulose fibers with heat
activatable polyacrylic acid (PAA).

Regarding the spinning process,
one key difference compared to
conventional wet spinning techniques is spinneret orifice diameter.
To produce sufficiently stable dope flows, the spinneret diameter
needs to be larger (0.5–1 mm) compared to diameters used in
conventional wet spinning processes (10–300 μm). This
diameter constraint stems from the flow behavior of the spinning dope.
Similarly to aqueous cellulose fiber suspensions, the DES-cellulose
fiber suspension exhibits a propensity to form agglomerates of fibers,
often referred to as flocs.36 This agglomeration
behavior results in clogging with smaller spinneret orifices. The
larger spinneret diameter influences the solidification of the structure
and thusly governs the subsequent spinning process phases.

In
the early phases of development, we observed that using rolls
or godets to draw the incipient fiber yarn was challenging because
of the slow solidification and poor wet strength of the incipient
fiber yarn. Alternative drawing approaches were tested, and an inclined
channel with an ethanol stream was most promising in early testing.
We found that by adjusting the angle of the spinning channel and flow
rate of ethanol in it, yarn could be continuously spun. Similarly
to dry-jet wet spinning, initial drawing occurs in an air gap before
the spinning dope comes in contact with ethanol. The angle of the
inclined channel and flow rate of ethanol in it can be used to adjust
the external force applied to the yarn, that is, extent of drawing.
We evaluated the spinning approach byconstructing a modular prototype spinning line (shown
in Figure 1), where
process critical parameters could be measured and controlled;

studying the influence of three parameters;
spinneret
diameter, the combined effect of angle and flow rate in the inclined
channel, and twisting of the spun yarn;

comparing the structure and tensile properties of yarns
spun with different parameters through microscopy and load-strain
measurements.

Experimental Section
Materials
Never-dried,
bleached softwood pulp was supplied
by a mill in central Finland. PAA (Mv 450 000
mol/g), urea, and choline chloride (ChCl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Finland. Ethanol used in the spinning trials contained a maximum of
0.5 wt % of water. All chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade
and used as received.

Preparation of Spinning Dope
The
spinning dope was
prepared according to Tenhunen et al.27 ChCl and urea were mixed together in a molar ratio of 1:2. The mixture
was heated to 100 °C under constant stirring in a closed system
until a clear homogeneous liquid was formed. The pulp was washed twice;
first to Na+ form according to Swerin et al.37 and second several times with excess acetone
to remove water from the pulp. Prior to dispersing the pulp into the
DES, it was dried at 40 °C overnight in a vacuum.

The spinning
dope was prepared by dispersing the water free pulp in the ChCl/urea
(1:2 mole ratio) mixture at 100 °C under constant stirring overnight
as described by Tenhunen et al.27 Once
the dispersion had cooled to room temperature, 10 wt% of PAA was mixed
into it with a SpeedMixer (FlackTek Inc., UK) in a vacuum at 800 rpm
for 2 min and at 1500 rpm for 8 min. The resulting spinning dope had
a cellulose content of 4.4 wt%. Its gel-like consistency is shown
in Figure 2a.

Figure 2 (a) Spinning
dope. (b) Prototype spinning line.

Spinning of Fiber Yarn
The modular spinning system
consists of three main sections: the syringe pump, the channel, and
the spinning bath. A custom syringe pump with sufficient torque was
used to extrude the dope. The syringe piston was pushed with a screw-based
linear actuator that was driven by a stepper motor with a planetary
gear. The piston force was measured with a force transducer.

The inclined channel was a 1.8 m long polypropylene pipe with the
top section cut off. It had a circular cross section with a diameter
of 50 mm. The channel was mounted between the syringe pump and spinning
bath. The angle of the channel was adjusted and measured with a digital
angle gauge. The spinning bath had a total volume of 7 L. The spinning
bath was emptied and refilled with fresh ethanol between each 60 mL
syringe refill. Ethanol was circulated with a centrifugal pump from
the bottom of the spinning bath to the top of the channel. The ethanol
flow rate was adjusted with a flow regulating valve and measured with
a flow meter. A schematic illustration is shown in Figure 1 and the modular spinning system
is shown in Figure 2b.

The spinning dope was charged into a 60 mL syringe equipped
with
a tapered dispensing tip. All tests were run with a spinning rate
of 0.1 m/s. The volumetric flow rate for each syringe diameter was
set according to this spinning rate. Tapered dispensing tips purchased
from Drifton, UK with diameters 0.41 mm (22 gauge), 0.63 mm (20 gauge),
and 0.84 mm (18 gauge) were used. Fiber yarn was spun both with and
without the inclined channel. All three diameters were used without
the channel to research the influence of the syringe tip diameter
separately. The 0.63 mm tip was used in all spinning trials with the
channel.

Two ethanol flow rates (200 and 400 mL/min) and two
angles (5°
and 7°) were tested resulting in 4 different angle configurations.
The nomenclature and production parameters of the prepared yarns are
summarized in Table 1, where ID is the inner diameter of syringe tip, V̇DES is the volumetric flow rate of the DES suspension, V̇ethanol is the flow rate of ethanol,
and α is the channel angle. All spinning trials were performed
at room temperature.

G20-7-200	0.63	1.9	200	7	
G20-7-400	0.63	1.9	400	7	
After spinning,
all yarn samples were placed in a fresh bath of
ethanol for a minimum of 3 h to remove the remaining DES. After the
second bath, the yarns were air-dried in a fume hood for a minimum
of 24 h. Finally, the yarns were disentangled manually and the PAA
was cross-linked with the pulp fibers in an oven at 140 °C for
30 min.

Additional twisting and washing was performed on G20-7-200
yarns.
Three different posttreatments were studied: washing, dry twisting,
and wet twisting, which we denote as W, DT, and WT, respectively.
All posttreatments were performed before cross-linking. The first
posttreatment (W) was a short immersion in distilled water, which
was also performed by Tenhunen et al.27 The immersion time was extended from the previously used 5–30
s. The second posttreatment (DT) included washing, air drying, and
twisting once the yarn was dry. The third posttreatment (WT) included
washing and twisting immediately after the immersion while the yarn
was still wet. Twisting was performed with a stepper motor-driven
twisting device. Yarn samples (20 cm long) were twisted 50 revolutions.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM (MERLIN FE-SEM,
Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Germany) was used to study the morphology and
structure of the fiber yarns. Samples were prepared on double-sided
carbon adhesive discs attached to aluminium specimen stubs. Prior
to imaging, the samples were sputter-coated (Agar Auto Sputter Coater,
UK) with gold (Au) to improve specimen conductivity. The imaging was
conducted using 3.0 keV electron energy and 30 pA probe current. The
pixel resolution was 2048 × 1536. The approximate dimensions
of the yarns were measured from the SEM images using ImageJ.38

Mechanical Properties of Fiber Yarn
An Instron 5944
Single Column, Tabletop Universal Testing System operating in tensile
mode was utilized to analyze the tensile properties of the yarns.
Specimens (20 mm long) were analyzed using an extension rate of 1
mm min–1 and a 5 N load cell. Specimens were analyzed
in three conditions: dry, wet, and after prolonged immersion in water.
The wet specimens were immersed in water for 24 h water at 23 °C
prior to tensile testing. The prolonged immersion samples were immersed
in water for 70 h at 23 °C and dried at 23 °C and 50% relative
humidity for a minimum of 24 h prior to testing. All samples were
stored in 23 °C and 50% relative humidity for a minimum of 24
h before being measured. The results presented are the average of
ten parallel measurements.

Linear densities of selected samples
were measured by first measuring 1 m lengths of yarn and weighing
the lengths with a precision scale (METTLER, Switzerland). The diameters
of selected yarn samples were also measured with a pressure sensitive
micrometer (Lorentzen & Wettre, Sweden). Tenacities (cN/tex),
linear densities (tex), and elongation at break (%) of 10 wet and
dry twisted specimens were also measured using Lenzing Instrument
devices; Vibroskop and Vibrodyn 400 using a pretension weight of 7
g. Only dry samples were measured with the Lenzing Instrument devices.

Results and Discussion
In this research, we manufactured
a modular spinning line for continuous
production of fiber yarn. The modular system was used to produce fiber
yarn by using DES as a spinning medium for softwood pulp fibers. While
DES enables formation of a spinnable gel-like suspension, the time
required for solidification is longer compared to most solution spun
dopes. The use of an inclined channel enabled gentle drawing and transportation
of the incipient yarn without breaching. The yarn structure and properties
can be influenced by using different process parameters. Herein, we
discuss the influence of syringe tip diameter, ethanol flow rate,
angle of the inclined channel, and three different posttreatments.

Determination
of Spinning Parameters
While the DES-cellulose
fiber suspension can be extruded and spun, the fiber kinetics constrain
the use of smaller diameters. In the context of this research, 0.41
mm (22 gauge) was the smallest usable syringe tip size with the chosen
spinning dope composition and extrusion method. Smaller sizes could
not be used because of the propensity of cellulose fibers to flocculate,
resulting in clogging and unstable spinning.

The steady state
forces measured at the piston of the syringe (syringe inner diameter
26 mm) for the used extrusion rates were approximately 600, 350, and
150 N for the 0.41, 0.63, and 0.84 mm syringe tip diameters, respectively.
Continuous spinning with the inclined channel was not achieved with
the 0.41 mm syringe tip. The smaller diameter incipient yarn was too
weak for stable spinning using the inclined channel approach.

Fluctuations in the extrusion velocity of the dope were observed,
which were attributed to the aggregation and disaggregation behavior
of the fibers. Fibers agglomerated in the tapered tip, resulting in
an increase of pressure in the syringe. Upon discharge, the extrusion
velocity momentarily increased before returning to a steady-state
as the pressure stabilized. The authors consider it likely that the
flow profile velocity of the spinning dopes fluctuates during extrusion
despite a constant piston speed.

Continuous spinning rates ranged
from approximately 0.05 to 0.3
m/s with the 0.63 mm (20 gauge) syringe diameter. The spinning rate
of 0.1 m/s was chosen as it could be matched with the flow velocity
of a laminar ethanol stream with the chosen channel geometry. The
chosen spinning rate was higher than the previously used 0.075 m/s
by Tenhunen et al.27 Slowing the spinning
rate below 0.05 m/s resulted in an unsteady flow and discontinuities
in spinning because of breaching in the air gap and channel. Increasing
the spinning rate beyond 0.3 m/s increased extrusion pressures and
resulted in an inconsistent flow. While spinning rates above 0.1 m/s
were possible, their influence on yarn properties was not systematically
tested.

As the fibrillar suspension is extruded, shear forces
induce alignment
of the fibers in the axial direction. In their review, Lundahl et
al.39 showed that, in CNF wet spinning,
high shear rates in the spinneret (on the order of hundreds of s–1) are typically coupled with high stiffness and tensile
strength. Given a single orifice spinneret with a circular cross section,
the mean shear rate, γ˙, can be estimated
using the following equation 1  where v is the average flow
velocity and r is the spinneret radius.

As
the yarns were all spun with the same flow velocity, 0.1 m/s,
the shear rates for the 0.41, 0.63, and 0.84 mm spinnerets were 488,
318, and 238 s–1, respectively. These shear rates
are in the range suggested by Lundahl et al.39 but the values are not entirely comparable as the average dimensions
of fibers used in this research are not in the nanoscale. Moreover,
these shear conditions are localized resulting in a low total induced
shear.

Similarly to Ioncell-F or Lyocell fibers, the fiber yarns
produced
in this research are spun through an air gap. This technique, known
as dry-jet wet or air-gap spinning, typically results in highly oriented
structures as the incipient structure is stretched in an air gap before
de-solvation.40 Such a spinning technique
requires the incipient structure to be able to transmit the external
force, which in turn means high viscosities are necessary for continuous
high draw-ratio spinning. For example, the zero shear viscosities
of dopes used in the Ioncell-F process are between 5000 and 30 000
Pa s at spinning temperature.26 Within
a stable force region, the orientation can be increased without compromising
the stability of the spinning process.

While dry-jet wet spinning
is an established spinning process and
extensively researched, it is, to the author’s best knowledge,
exclusively used with dissolved polymers. The fiber yarn spinning
process discussed in this research is not based on a solution but
rather a fibrillar gel-like suspension. Because of this fundamental
difference, process parameters utilized in established dry-jet wet
spinning processes cannot be directly compared to the ones reported
in this research.

In the domain of fiber suspensions, a slightly
analogous situation
can be found in papermaking, where the influence of shear conditions
and fiber orientation on sheet properties has been studied extensively.
In Fourdrinier forming, the fiber orientation can be influenced through
the jet-to-wire speed ratio. For example, Svensson and Österberg41 showed that an increased jet-to-wire speed difference
led to increased anisotropy in the formed sheet.

Unlike typical
dry-jet wet spinning or papermaking where the external
force is controlled with pick-up rolls or wires, in the inclined channel
approach it is controlled via the channel angle and flow rate of ethanol.
The main forces involved in the inclined channel approach are illustrated
in the free body diagram that is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Free-body diagram of the incipient fiber yarn.

First, the rheological force () determines the maximum external force
() that
can be applied without breaching
the incipient fiber yarn. The net external force (extent of drawing)
is composed of the ethanol transporting it (), the friction between the yarn and the
channel (), the buoyancy of the yarn (), the
weight of the yarn (G⃗),
and the normal force (N⃗).
The magnitude of the external force can
be adjusted with the channel angle (α) and flow rate of ethanol
in it. Naturally, the forces are distributed along the length of incipient
yarn. The vectors in Figure 3 are not drawn as distributions to maintain legibility.

Similarly to other spinning processes, the control parameters are
interdependent. For example, the friction between the incipient yarn
and the channel surface is not only influenced by the mass and geometry
of the incipient fiber yarn but also the ethanol flow rate as it lubricates
the contact. Naturally, the ethanol flow speed changes with the channel
angle as well. The steepness of the channel and length of air gap
were kept moderate in this research to decrease the likelihood of
the yarn breaching in the channel. Because of the semi-buoyant nature
of the incipient yarn, measuring the ethanol flow velocity alone is
not sufficient to determine draw ratios.

Different channels
with different cross sections, lengths, and
materials were tested. A polypropylene pipe with a circular cross
section (diameter of 50 mm and length of 1.8 m) was chosen. Of all
geometrical shapes, a circle has the shortest length of wetted perimeter
for a given cross-sectional area. This means that for a given volumetric
flow rate a circular channel results in the highest maximum depth
of the flow profile. Furthermore, a more even distribution of ethanol
was possible with the circular cross section. Increasing the channel
length above 2 m resulted in frequent breaching of the incipient yarn.

The time that it takes for the incipient yarn to travel down the
channel (10–15 s) is insufficient to remove all the DES. The
ethanol flow did, however, appear to expedite the removal. While this
was not verified through measurements, the wet strength of the yarn
after the channel was sufficient for it to be picked with a rotating
roll, unlike fiber yarns samples spun directly into a bath after the
same amount of time. In this research, the incipient yarns were placed
in a second ethanol bath for 3 h to remove the remaining DES. It is
likely that this time could be significantly reduced. For example,
Tenhunen et al.27 placed the yarns in an
ethanol bath for approximately 10 min.

Yarn Morphology and Structure
The influence of the
spinning parameters on the topographical properties of the spun fiber
yarns was investigated with a SEM system. Micrographs of eight different
yarn samples spun with different spinning parameters are shown in Figure 4. Samples spun with
different syringe tips into a stationary bath are shown on the top
row (Figure 4a–c),
samples spun with two different channel conditions are shown on the
middle row (Figure 4d,e), and posttreated samples are shown on the bottom row (Figure 4f–h). The
name of each sample is shown below the corresponding micrograph.

Figure 4 Micrographs
(75×-magnification) of yarns spun with different
parameters: (a) G22, (b) G20, (c) G18, (d) G20-5-200, (e) G20-7-400,
(f) W, (g) DT, (h) WT.

Fiber yarns spun with the smaller tip diameter displayed
a more
tightly packed structure as well as smaller external dimensions. The
yarns spun with larger syringe orifices had a more hairy surface with
individual fibers protruding out as seen on Figure 4c. Channel spinning (Figure 4d,e) had no visible influence on the morphology
of the fiber yarn. Posttreated yarns also displayed a more tightly
packed structure. The influence of the twisting can be seen in Figure 4g,h. Wet-twisted
fiber yarn specimens displayed a more tightly wound structure compared
to dry-twisted samples.

Table 2 shows the
approximate maximum and minimum diameters of fiber yarn samples measured
from the SEM micrographs as well as their linear density. The difference
between maximum and minimum values indicates a variation in the cross-sectional
geometry of the yarn. The cross-sectional geometry of the yarn is
neither circular nor constant, which makes the determination of area
and therefore stress challenging. The fiber yarn displays similar
inherent irregularity and variation as other yarns produced from natural
fibers. Naturally, the SEM micrographs cannot be used to accurately
measure the three-dimensional shape of the yarn. Therefore, linear
density and tenacity are applied instead of cross-sectional area and
tensile stress. Approximate tensile stress values are given in Supporting Information Figure S2.

Fiber yarn thicknesses between 50 and 100 μm
were measured
with a pressure sensitive micrometer. These results were omitted as
measurements from the SEM micrographs (shown in Table 2), indicate significantly larger external
dimensions. This discrepancy was attributed to the yarn’s loosely
packed structure which is compressible. Such challenges are typical
in the field of yarn thickness measurements42 and further studies are necessary to establish a more robust process
for analyzing the geometry of fiber yarn.

Tensile Properties
The tensile testing data from all
measured fiber yarn samples are illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5 is composed of two sections: tenacities are shown
on the top and elongation at break on the bottom. The bars are grouped
in three categories: syringe tip, channel, and posttreated based on
the spinning parameters. These categories are separated with a vertical
line. The three different conditions, that is, dry, wet, and prolonged
immersion (denoted as 70 h) are distinguished by color. Additionally,
the dry linear density value for each specimen is shown below the
specimen name.

Figure 5 Tenacities, linear densities, and elongation of all fiber
yarn
samples.

The error bars shown in Figure 5 do not take into
account the error in linear density
measurements. The same linear density values were applied for the
calculation of the tenacity of wet and prolonged immersion samples.
Because of the high water absorbing tendency of the fiber yarn, wet
linear density is not applied in Figure 5.

Influence of the Syringe Tip Diameter
Samples G22,
G20, and G18 were spun with different syringe tip diameters without
the channel. While fiber yarn spun with the largest syringe tip (G18,
0.84 mm inner diameter) withstood the highest maximum load, their
linear density was larger resulting in low tenacity values. Load at
break values for yarn samples are shown in Supporting Information Figure S1 and Table S1. The measured linear densities
of yarns spun without the channel positively correlate with the cross-sectional
area of the used syringe tip. The load bearing capability, however,
did not scale in the same relation. Fiber yarns spun with the G20
(0.63 mm) syringe tips had the highest tenacity of fiber yarns spun
without a channel.

The thinner yarns were more water-stable
compared to thicker yarns. The reduction in maximum load between a
dry and wet state was 21% with G22 samples, whereas it was 39 and
45% with G20 and G18 samples, respectively. As stated by Tenhunen
et al.,27 it is likely that PAA becomes
the main load bearing component when the yarns are exposed to water
as interfibrillar bonding is compromised. The more tightly packed
structure is more water-stable as the water cannot penetrate the structure
easily.

Prolonged immersion samples (70 h water bath followed
by drying)
retained or even increased in tenacity. The highest increase in load
at break (73%) between dry and prolonged immersion samples was observed
with the samples spun with a G18 syringe tip. Thinner yarns did not
exhibit the same increase in maximum load after a prolonged immersion
in water.

The thinnest yarn (G22) was stiffer with a 4.6 ±
0.4% elongation
at break compared to the 7.5 ± 0.6 and 7.6 ± 0.9% of G20
and G18, respectively. The samples exhibited similar elongation values
in a wet state. The prolonged immersion resulted in increased stiffness
in all samples spun without the channel.

Influence of Channel Conditions
Samples G20-5-200,
G20-5-400, G20-7-200, and G20-7-400 demonstrate the influence of the
channel. The channel spinning approach reduced the linear density
by 22–29% compared to samples spun with the same syringe tip
diameter without the channel. From the non-posttreated channel spun
samples, the highest increase in maximum load of 13.7% was measured
between samples G20 and G20-7-200. The highest increase in tenacity
of 61%, however, was measured between samples G20 and lower linear
density G20-7-400.

The non-posttreated channel spun samples
exhibited lower wet strength compared to samples spun without the
channel. Similarly to fiber yarn spun without the channel, the channel-spun
samples retained their tenacity after the prolonged immersion. The
yarns that had been spun onto the channel were on average stiffer
than the yarns spun without a channel.

Increasing the ethanol
flow rate from 200 to 400 mL/min increased
the tenacity by 13.2% with a 5° channel and by 8.2% with 7°
channel. Similarly, increasing the angle from 5° to 7° increased
the tenacity by 14.8% with a 200 mL/min flow rate and by 9.7% with
a 400 mL/min flow rate. The results indicate that increasing the angle
or the flow rate results in increased tenacity. Increasing the angle
or the ethanol flow rate beyond these values, however, resulted in
unstable spinning. The observed reductions in linear density while
maintaining or even improving load bearing capability indicate that
the channel approach induces drawing. More detailed research on the
orientation and structure of the fiber yarn would be necessary to
confirm this hypothesis.

The spinning trials carried out in
this research suggest that channel
spinning is more advantageous compared to spinning without a channel.
The tenacities achieved through channel spinning are, however, modest
compared to the influence of twisting. Additionally, the differences
in tensile properties between the four different channel configurations
are marginal. This suggests that the main benefits of the channel
lie in enabling the gentle transportation of the incipient yarn into
subsequent processing phases rather than substantial improvements
in the fiber yarn structure or properties.

Influence of Posttreatments
The three tested posttreatments
had a more substantial influence on the yarn’s tensile properties.
Washing the yarn prior to cross-linking improved load bearing capability
and reduced the linear density. A similar posttreatment was reported
by Tenhunen et al.27

Twisting the
fiber yarn before cross-linking resulted in the highest increases
in tenacity in the context of this research. While twisting the yarn
both wet and dry increased its tenacity, a higher tenacity was achieved
by twisting the fiber yarn directly after washing without allowing
it to dry first. The WT samples exhibited both highest load bearing
capability and smallest dimensions of the posttreated samples. Furthermore,
the WT fiber yarn was more water-stable. The reduction in load bearing
capability between dry and wet samples was 45% for WT samples and
80% for G20-7-400 samples. Similarly to decreasing the syringe diameter,
the wet twisting appears to decrease mean interfibrillar distance
and therefore results in more cross-linking. As a consequence, the
fiber yarn has higher tenacity both in a wet and dry state.

Samples DT and WT were also measured with the Vibrodyn and Vibroskop
devices. The results are shown in Table 3. The Vibroskop device measures the linear
density by setting the fiber is set into its natural vibration by
an electronic delta impulse. The applicability and accuracy of this
measurement method for fiber yarns was not verified in the context
of this research, but the results agree with the caliper and scale-based
measurements.

Table 3 Tenacities of DT and WT Yarn Samples,
Measured with the Vibroskop Device
 	linear density (tex)	tenacity (cN/tex)	elongation (%)	modulus (cN/tex)	
DT	13.7 ± 0.2	6.5 ± 0.3	5.2 ± 0.5	257.4 ± 8.1	
WT	13.2 ± 0.5	7.5 ± 0.3	4.3 ± 0.3	357.8 ± 16.5	
Comparing to the results reported
by Tenhunen et al.27 the linear densities
were reduced from 21 to
24 tex to approximately 13 tex. Tenacities were improved from the
previously reported 5.3 ± 1.8 to 7.5 ± 0.3 cN/tex. Given
the range of attainable properties, the yarns can be further developed
in an application-oriented approach. For example, Orelma et al.43 produced fiber yarns with a similar process.
The open inner structure and good water absorption capability of the
fiber yarns enabled their use in cyclodextrin-based capture of synthetic
estrogen hormones from water.

Conclusions
A
continuous spinning scheme was demonstrated with a prototype
spinning line. Cellulose fiber yarns were spun from a spinning dope
produced by treating cellulose fibers with a DES. The DES enabled
production of a spinning dope with sufficient viscosity for spinning
without affecting the ultrastructure of the wood fibers. Water stability
was achieved with a 10 wt% addition of PAA which was cross-linked
with the cellulose fibers after spinning.

The novel feature
of the spinning line is that unlike traditional
wet spinning or dry-jet wet spinning, the dope is extruded into an
inclined channel instead of a stationary bath. The channel approach
enables flow-induced drawing of the incipient yarn, expedites the
removal of DES, and transports the incipient yarn into another bath
where final solidification takes place. Values, enabling continuous
spinning, were determined for syringe tip diameter, dope flow rate,
channel angle, and ethanol flow rate through successive testing.

SEM micrographs revealed that the syringe tip diameter influences
both the diameter and packing density of fibers in the yarn. Despite
tighter packing with smaller syringe tips, the highest tenacity values
were measured for the yarns produced with a 0.63 mm diameter syringe
tip. Yarn samples spun with the optimal channel configuration had
a lower linear density and a higher load at break compared to yarn
samples spun directly into a spinning bath. Wet twisting the yarn
before cross-linking resulted in a further increase in both dry and
wet strength. The highest tenacity was obtained by using a 0.63 mm
syringe tip diameter with the inclined channel and an added wet twisting
posttreatment. This resulted in yarns with a linear density of 13.2
tex, tenacity of 7.5 cN/tex, and modulus of 357.8 cN/tex.

The
improved spinning technique coupled with inexpensive and environmentally
friendly raw materials presents an opportunity to produce yarns suitable
for use in for example nonwoven structures. The achieved controllability
of yarn properties with the developed spinning approach encourages
further investigation of the process.
