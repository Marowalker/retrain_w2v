Two synthesized polymers were studied
as potential corrosion inhibitors for N80 Steel in a sweet corrosive
environment. Poly-2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride
(PDMC), or P1, and poly-2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethyl ammonium
chloride-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone
P(DMC-co-NVP), or P2, were investigated using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy, polarization technique, scanning electrochemical
microscopy (SECM), scanning Kelvin probe (SKP), and scanning vibrating
electrode technique (SVET). The surface was examined using contact
angle, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy methods.
Analyses of electrochemical and polarization techniques revealed a
PDMC polymer with a better inhibition efficiency. The SECM, SKP, and
SVET methods showed the insulating ability of the polymers that formed
a protective coating on the metal surface.

Introduction
Corrosion
of casing and pipeline steels used in oilfield is very
common due to the harsh environment. N80 Steel is mostly used in oilfields
of China due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of availability.1,2 The ions, gases, pressure, and temperature altogether create a very
corrosive environment for the casing steel. The endurance of steel
is compromised, giving rise to accidents, contamination, economic
losses, and reduction in working efficiency.3−5 The traditional
anticorrosive coatings are
rich in heavy metals that are toxic to the environment. The toxic
components and strict regulations for the protection of environment
limit the use of existing coatings.

Alternative ways with eco-friendly
components are being explored globally to meet this problem. So, this
led to our motivation to develop suitable coatings that are environmentally
benign and effective to mitigate corrosion of the N80 Steel.6−8 Polymers are used to mitigate
corrosion of steels due to their ability to form strong bonds and
complexes with metal ions. The presence of heteroatoms, conjugated
bonds, functional groups, and aromatic rings vindicate the use of
polymers as corrosion inhibitors.9−12 Polymers can be synthesized
using various monomers according to the demand of the situation. Conducting
polymers, co-polymers, water-soluble polymers, polymer composites,
and polymers with nanoparticles can be prepared with strong adherent
properties. Co-polymers contain heteroatoms and cyclic rings inside,
which should act as favorable centers for adsorption on N80 Steel
surface. Subsequently, it can be assumed that together the poly-2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethyl
ammonium chloride (PDMC) polymer and poly-2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyltrimethyl
ammonium chloride-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone
P(DMC-co-NVP) polymer would be efficient corrosion
inhibitors in the present study.13−15 In an extension of our
previous work to develop and
test effective corrosion mitigators, the intention of the present
study was to synthesize two co-polymers PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP) and to study their corrosion mitigation properties using different
techniques.16−20

Results and Discussion
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Measurement
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results
were used to investigate
the changes at the steel/solution interface in the absence and presence
of polymers. Nyquist plots of the two polymer inhibitors are represented
in Figure 1a,b. The
Nyquist plots of PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP) show only
one-time constant equivalent to one capacitive loop, indicating the
presence of a single charge transfer process.21,22 The
appearance of depressed semicircles in the absence and presence of
inhibitors is almost similar, suggesting that the corrosion mechanism
of N80 Steel in 3.5% NaCl solution saturated with CO2 does
not change after the addition of inhibitors.

Figure 1 Electrochemical Nyquist
curves for (a) PDMC and (b) P(DMC-co-NVP).

The roughness and
inhomogeneities at the working electrode produced during the corrosion
reaction relate the depressed behavior of the semicircle.23 The diameter of the depressed semicircles increases
significantly when the inhibitors are added in the sweet corrosive
solution and this goes on increasing with increase in the polymer
concentration. The above annotations clearly indicate that the used
polymers mitigate the corrosion of N80 Steel by adsorbing on the surface
and forming a protective film to reduce the number of bare active
centers responsible for the dissolution of N80 Steel.18

The equivalent circuit consisting of charge transfer
resistance (Rct), constant phase element
of double layer (CPE), and solution resistance (Rs), as shown in Figure 2a, was used for fitting the experimental data.24 The Nyquist plot of polymers at different concentrations
was analyzed by different equivalent circuit with inductance (Figure 2b) as the dissolution
of steel is still under the influence of the direct charge transfer
at the electrode surface.24,25 1  where Y is the CPE constant (−1 sn cm–2), j is the square root of
−1, and n represents the phase shift. The
constant phase element can be correlated
to the values of n if resistance (n = 0, Y = R), capacitance (n = 1, Y = C), inductance
(n = −1, Y = L), and max is the angular frequency for Z in the
Nyquist plot.26 The CPE is usually used
in the circuit instead of a double-layer capacitance (Cdl) to get better fitting results. The impedance of the
CPE is given by 2  where Y0 and n stand
for the CPE constant and exponent, respectively, j = (−1)1/2 is an imaginary number, and ω
is the angular frequency in rad s–1 (ω = 2πf), where f is the frequency in Hz. Double-layer
capacitance (Cdl) was obtained by the
expression27 3  where Rt is the charge transfer resistance, Y0 is the CPE constant, and n is the exponent of CPE. The corrosion parameters evaluated from
the circuit are shown in Table 2.

Figure 2 Equivalent
circuit used
to fit the electrochemical data.

The impedance reaction of N80 Steel in 3.5% NaCl solution
saturated with CO2 has significantly deviated after the
addition of inhibitors. The Nyquist figure pointed that charge transfer
resistance increases with increase in inhibitor concentration, indicating
the adsorption of polymers on the N80 Steel surface.28 The measured Cdl values decreased
with increase in the concentrations of PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP), emphasizing a boost in the electrical double layer and reduction
in the local dielectric constant, vindicating the formation of a protective
film by polymers on the N80 Steel surface.29,30 Also,
the lower Cdl values are due to the steady
substitution of water molecules by the polymer molecules, which further
decreases the extent of metal dissolution.31 A strange trend was observed in which the inductive loop was absent
in the Nyquist plot of PDMC but present in that of P(DMC-co-NVP) inhibitor. The presence of the inductive loop can be related
to surface inhomogeneties and roughness.

From Table 1, it is clear that the greatest
outcome was observed at 500 ppm of PDMC inhibitor, which gives Rct value of 2996 Ω cm2 for
N80 Steel in the acidic media.32

a P1 = PDMC, and P2 = P(DMC-co-NVP).

Bode plots for polymers are shown
in Figure 3a,b. At
intermediate frequencies, log|Z| vs log f gives best slope values
of 0.470–0.713 for PDMC that are close to −1. The phase
angle values obtained for PDMC were 33.4–60.5° intended
for N80 Steel as shown in Table 1. Phase angle plots as shown in Figure 4a,b depicts only one peak, confirming the
presence of a single time constant.33 The
increase in the peak size at higher PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP) concentrations can be related to the lower capacitive behavior
of N80 Steel due to further adsorption of the polymer molecules on
the surface. A perfect capacitive performance would result in a slope
value (−S) of −1 and a phase angle
of −90° (α).18,34 −S and α attain faster steady state and their values are close
to −1 and −90°, respectively, in the presence of
polymers than in their absence, which shows the inhibitive action
of the polymer on the N80 Steel surface.33,35

Polarization Measurements
Polarization
curves for PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP) inhibitors in 3.5%
NaCl solution saturated with CO2 are given in Figure 5a,b.

Figure 5 Tafel
polarization curves for (a) PDMC and (b) P(DMC-co-NVP) polymers.

The cathodic
and anodic Tafel line permits the evaluation of the corrosion current
density (Icorr) and they do not change
even after the addition of inhibitors, suggesting that the reaction
mechanism of N80 Steel is not hindered due to the presence of inhibitors.
The evaluated parameters Icorr, corrosion
potential (Ecorr), cathodic and anodic
Tafel slopes (bc, ba), and efficiency of corrosion inhibition (ηTafel%) are given in Table 2.32,36 Both anodic and cathodic
potentials are shifted as shown in Figure 5a,b. According to the previous reports,28,37 (i) inhibitors can be categorized into cathodic or anodic type if
the difference in Ecorr value is >85
mV and, (ii) likewise, if the difference in Ecorr value is <85, the inhibitor can predominantly be mixed
type. In the present study, shift in Ecorr values is within 64 mV, suggesting that PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP) inhibitors acted as mixed type.22,38 The mixed-type
inhibitors act both on hydrogen evolution and metal dissolution simultaneously.
The value of Icorr decreases to 7.5 A
cm–2 for PDMC and 13.6 A cm–2 for
P(DMC-co-NVP) with increasing inhibitor concentration.
The best efficiency of 93% for corrosion inhibition was detected for
PDMC, which is consistent with the electrochemical impedance result.

Scanning Electrochemical
Microscopy (SECM),
Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP), and Scanning Vibrating Electrode Technique
(SVET) Analyses
Figure 6 demonstrates the three-dimensional pictures of SECM
for N80 Steel in corrosive media.39,40 As the microprobe
approaches the metal surface without any inhibitor film, a higher
current is observed (surface acts as a conductor).

Figure 6 SECM images for (a) N80
+ 3.5% NaCl solution x- and y-axis,
(b) N80 + PDMC x-
and y-axis, and (c) N80 + P(DMC-co-NVP) x- and y-axis.

This conducting
phenomenon can be ascribed to the direct contact of the probe with
the metal surface, resulting in higher current values as shown in Figure 6a.41 On the other hand, when the probe approaches the metal
surface with polymer film, a lower current is observed (insulating
surface). This may be attributed to the insulating film of the polymer
that blocks the direct contact of the probe with the metal surface,
thereby blocking the diffusion of oxygen and corrosive media toward
the working electrode, as shown in Figure 6b,c. The N80 Steel surface behaves as conductive
in the absence of polymers and insulating in the presence of polymers,
which can be established by the higher current (conducting) and lower
current (insulating).42

The SKP technique
involves the vibration of the probe mechanically over the working
electrode surface, which creates an alternative capacitor and induces
the flow of an alternative current between the probe and the N80 Steel
surface.43 Lower corrosion potential regions
indulge active zones of the surface, and these anodic zones take part
in corrosion reactions as shown in Figure 7.39 The SKP profiles
show that during exposure, the potential of N80 Steel is uneven without
a polymer film due to deterioration process causing cracks and roughness
on the surface (Figure 7a). The prolonged cathodic activity on N80 Steel having PDMC and
P(DMC-co-NVP) inhibitors is probably associated to
the time needed for the corrosive media and oxygen to penetrate the
polymer film as in Figure 7b,c.43 The prominent cathodic area
in the presence of the polymer film and a wide anodic area in the
absence of the polymer film support the earlier outcome of our electrochemical
tests.

graph for (a) N80 + 3.5% NaCl solution x- and y-axis, (b) N80 + PDMC x- and y-axis, and (c) N80 + P(DMC-co-NVP) x- and y-axis.

The SVET decrypts useful contribution in the study of
localized corrosion with more possible oblivion to explore through
electrochemical approach. The method shows excellent electrochemical
result for the steel surface with respect to time. Inhibition of corrosion
is a sluggish procedure that occurs due to the different pH and potential
developed on the metal surface.44 The initiation
of first pit started quickly, which kept on spreading at the N80 Steel
surface without a polymer film for 0–5–10 h (Figure 8a–c).

Figure 8 SVET images
for (a) N80
+ 3.5% NaCl solution at 0, 5,
and 10 h, (b) N80 + PDMC at 0, 5, and 10 h, and (c) N80 + P(DMC-co-NVP) at 0, 5, and 10 h.

The anodic region was uniformly scattered on the N80 Steel
surface
for corrosive media. The pit development was lower and at a slow rate
at the N80 Steel surface with PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP)
inhibitors (Figure 8b,c). As the time progresses, the pit and cracks start to develop
on the metal surface, leading to intense anodic activity around the
pits and some opposite cathodic movement at the surface without pits.
For N80 Steel surface with P1 inhibitor, the anodic activity can be
observed at the pit, even though predominantly the cathodic currents
were widely distributed over the surface. The delay in the progress
of the cathodic region on the surface having an inhibitor is possibly
associated to the time requisite for acidic media to infiltrate the
polymer film at the metal surface.41,45

Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) Analyses
The high-resolution image of the
N80 Steel surface without polymers showed a corroded surface (Figure 9a). The surface was
uneven, fractured, rough, and damaged with pits. The image of N80
Steel with a polymer film was smooth, uniform, and less deteriorated,
as shown in Figure 9b,c. The thorough investigation of the high-resolution images reveals
that the protective film formed by polymers on the N80 Steel surface
saved it effectively from the corrosive media.46

Figure 9 SEM micrographs for (a)
N80 + 3.5% NaCl solution, (b)
N80 + PDMC polymer, and (c) N80 + P(DMC-co-NVP) polymer.

The three-dimensional pictures
of AFM for N80 Steel
surface with and without the polymer film are shown in Figure 10a–c. The metal surface
can be seen with a roughness scale of 310 nm without the polymers,
suggesting that the surface was strongly corroded (Figure 10a). When PDMC and P(DMC-co-NVP) inhibitors are present in the solution, the roughness
scale decrease to 100 and 150 nm proposing that the metal surface
was more smooth, flat, and consistent (Figure 10b,c).47 All these
outcomes emphasized that both polymers exhibited substantial resistance
to corrosion of N80 Steel.

images for (a) 3.5%
NaCl solution + N80 Steel, (b) N80 + PDMC polymer, and (c) N80 + P(DMC-co-NVP) polymer.

Conclusions
The two inhibitors studied showed good
inhibition efficiency in
3.5% NaCl solution saturated with CO2 on N80 Steel. The
higher Rct values and the lower Cdl values with higher inhibitor concentration
reflect the higher efficiency of corrosion inhibition. Polarization
curvature evaluation (within 64 mV) pointed that both polymers behaved
as mixed-type inhibitor. SECM, SKP, and SVET studies reflected that
the surface was more inductive in the presence of polymers and more
conductive in their absence. The mitigation of N80 Steel corrosion
occurred due blockage of active sites on the metal surface, as suggested
by SEM and AFM investigations.

The solution was saturated with nitrogen gas for 30 min while heating
at 80 °C and left for 5 h. The obtained polymer was separated
by rotating evaporation method and dried in vacuum oven.

40 mL distilled water. Methacrylatoethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride
(DMC), 1.2 mL, was added into the solution. Then, 20 mL distilled
water containing 0.02 g potassium peroxodisulfate was poured into
the solution under continuous stirring. The solution was saturated
with nitrogen gas for 30 min while heating at 80 °C and left

Electrochemical Methods
Electrochemical
analyses were performed using Autolab and corrosion cell having N80
Steel as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode,
and saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. The EIS
measurements were done at a frequency range between 100 and 0.00001
kHz using an amplitude of 10 mV peak-to-peak alternating current signals.49 The efficiency of corrosion inhibition (ηEIS%) was calculated using the following relation 4  where Rct,inh and Rct,blank are the charge
transfer resistances in the presence and absence of inhibitors, respectively.

Open circuit potential was performed for all tests to ensure a
stable potential. Tafel curves were obtained using a scan rate of
1 mV s–1 between a potential of −300 and
+300 mV. Inhibition efficiency (Tafel %) was evaluated using the following
expression505050 5  where Icorrblank and Icorrinh are the corrosion current
density values
without and with inhibitor, respectively. The experiments were repeated
three times to ensure the quality reproducibility of the electrochemical
results.

SECM, SKP, and SVET Analyses
SECM studies were carried
out using an electrochemical work station
of CHI900C model consisting of the three-electrode assembly. SKP and
SVET tests were performed using Princeton Versascan 3F workstation
in a three-electrode corrosion cell.

SEM and AFM Analyses
Surface analysis of steels with and
without polymers was carried out using Zeiss model TESCAN instrument.

of the N80 Steel was determined using the MDT analyzer.51
