Modified
embedded atom method potential parameters of beryllium
oxide (BeO) have been developed, which can well reproduce the thermodynamic
properties of beryllium oxide. To accurately describe the interactions
between the atoms in the BeO structure, the density functional theory
is used to calculate the fundamental properties such as the lattice
constant, bulk modulus, and elastic constant, which are used for the
potential fitting. The properties such as the enthalpy and specific
heat are used to test the validity of the potential parameters. The
calculated results by the developed potential parameters are compared
with the experimental and other theoretical data as a function of
temperature. The good agreement between the calculated results by
the new potential and the experimental data verifies the potential
parameters. The developed potential parameters have also been used
to predict the thermal conductivity of BeO as a function of temperature
for further applications of beryllium oxide.

1 Introduction
Recently, beryllium oxide
(BeO) has attracted much attention due
to its outstanding properties, such as high hardness,1 high electrical resistivity,2 high thermal conductivity,3 high melting
point, and excellent radiation resistance.4 Beryllium oxide is widely used in many high-performance semiconductor
parts due to its good thermal conductivity and good electrical resistivity.
It is also used as a structural ceramic for high-performance microwave
devices, vacuum tubes, magnetrons, and gas lasers. The band gap of
BeO is about 10.63 eV,5,6 which makes it suitable for application
in optoelectronic devices.7 BeO also has
a long history of being used in the nuclear area for both fission
and fusion power generation due to its excellent mechanical, thermal,
and chemical properties.1,8 The excellent chemical
compatibility between BeO and
UO2 makes it possible to prepare UO2 and BeO
composite fuel. By coupling with BeO, the poor thermal conductivity
of UO2 could be effectively improved.9,10 Moreover,
BeO possesses good irradiation resistance and neutron scattering performance,
which increase the preference of its application in nuclear reactors.11,12

In the past several decades, the electronic, optical, and
mechanical
properties of BeO have been reported in many experimental and theoretical
works.5,6,13−19 Those properties are attributed to the unique structure of BeO,
which is the only alkaline-earth oxide crystallizing in the hexagonal
wurtzite structure20 at room temperature,
while the other oxides in this family have the rock salt structure.
Compared with the rock salt structures, the wurtzite structure has
a stronger covalent bond, and the Be–O bond is shorter than
that of the rock salt structures. This particular structure makes
BeO have some unique physical properties. For the BeO system, it has
a hexagonal phase of wurtzite (WZ), cubic phase of zinc blende (ZB),
and cubic phase with the rock salt structure. Among these phases,
WZ BeO is the ground state, and the other two phases of BeO are hard
to obtain. The experimental samples keep the wurtzite structure at
least up to 55GPa without any transition observed.21 Using a first-principles pseudopotential method, Park et
al.22 theoretically studied the series
of phase transitions, wurtzite → zinc blende → rock
salt; the two corresponding transition pressures for the wurtzite-to-zinc
blende transition and the zinc blende-to-rock salt transition are
91 and 147 GPa, respectively. Boettger et al.23 found the same trend by using two all-electron, full-potential electronic
structure techniques. In the following parts, we will mainly focus
on the WZ phase since it is the most common stable sample in the experiment.

The studies of BeO from an atomic aspect are very important in
understanding the mechanism of the properties mentioned above. However,
it is comparatively difficult for the experimental research compared
with theoretical studies. Although first-principles calculation is
a very effective method to study BeO from an atomic aspect, it is
challenging to study the structure with a large number of atoms especially
for the system with defects, such as vacancy and doping. Besides the
first-principles calculations, another method to study the materials
from an atomic aspect is the molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. Compared
with the DFT calculations, MD has some advantages when studying the
properties of the material, especially for the microcosmic system
and the system with defects, which are very difficult for the first-principles
calculations. Besides, the MD simulation is a very useful tool to
study the thermal conductivity and thermodynamic properties compared
with the first-principles calculations. Although Malakkal et al.24 studied the thermal conductivity using first-principles
calculations combined with Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and
the Slack model, the studied system is a perfect crystal structure.
To study the system with the defect by MD, the potential of BeO is
needed.

In the MD simulations, the interaction between atoms
is described
by the potential parameters. It should be mentioned that the potential
parameters play a crucial role in accurately calculating the properties
of materials. Recently, Byggmästar et al.25 have developed a new empirical bond order potential to
study the nanotube structure and nanosheet BeO. However, their potential
aims to describe the interaction of atoms in the nanostructure and
underestimated the thermal conductivity for the bulk structure. In
the following parts, we will show that our present potential parameters
exhibit more improvements on those properties, especially for thermal
expansion and heat transfer in the bulk structures.

In this
work, we theoretically studied the thermodynamic properties
of BeO by using the MD simulations. First, we developed the potential
parameter of the BeO system with the potential form of modified embedded
atom method (MEAM). To obtain the accurate atomic interaction, the
parameters for this potential are carefully tested and compared with
the results calculated using the DFT theory and experimental data.
Using the new potential, the expansion is examined over a wide temperature
range and compared with the experimental data. This property was not
included in the fitting procedure, and as such it provides one test
of the approach. Similarly, the temperature dependence of the expansion,
enthalpy, and heat capacity is determined and compared with the experimental
data. Finally, the thermal conductivity is studied using the new fitted
potential parameters.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Potential Parameters
For the MEAM
potential, there are 14 parameters for each kind of element, as shown
in Table 1. The Ec is the cohesive energy of the reference structures,
which is hexagonal close-packed (hcp) for Be and dimer for O in this
work. re, α, and A are the distance between two atoms in the equilibrium structure,
the parameter related to the bulk modulus and cohesive energy, and
adjusted parameters, respectively. The four parameters β(0), β(1), β(2), and β(3), which are related to the electron density, are used to
adjust to the decay rate in different directions. The other four parameters t(0), t(1), t(2), and t(3) are
the angular contributions to the electron density. In the hexagonal
structure, the values of c/a (the
ratio of lattice constant) and elastic constant are significantly
affected by t(3), and the value of t(3)should be less than zero to fulfill the fact
that c/a < 1.26 For the density scaling parameters, which are element-dependent,
the values of 1.0 and 3.77 are chosen for Be and O, respectively.
Moreover, the screening parameters play an essential role in the MEAM
potential. In our fitting progress, we find that the parameters of
the Be and O pair screened by the O atoms have a significant effect
on the elastic constant. For the static calculations, the potential
gives a better agreement of the elastic constant with the experimental
results if these parameters are not included. Here, these parameters
are not used in the static calculations at 0 K. However, the parameters
are critical when the temperature increases. So, this parameter is
carefully tested and chosen as 0.5 and 2.80 in the MD simulations.
For Be, the parameters partially come from the data of ref (27), while there are also
some differences due to the Be atoms located at a different environment
in the Be or BeO structure. Similar to the Be atoms, the parameters
of the O atom partially come from ref (28). First, the parameters of Be and O use the same
values as in refs (27) and (28). Next, we
start the fitting of potential parameter of the BeO binary interatomic
potential. Since the hcp structure, rather than the fcc (face-centered
cubic) or bcc (body-centered cubic) structure, shows better similarities
to the structure of WZ BeO, the hcp structure is chosen as the reference
structure in our fitting process. The Be–O dimer distance is
first calculated by the DFT calculations. Based on this optimized
distance, the value of re is carefully
adjusted in the MD simulations under the temperature conditions. Simultaneously,
the values of cohesive energy and α are also chosen based on
the first-principles calculations. Finally, these parameters are slightly
adjusted to make the value of elastic constant closer to the experimental
data. The final parameters’ set derived by this fitting process
is summarized in Tables 1 and 2, which are for single elements and
pair interactions, respectively. The structure parameters for WZ BeO
are listed in Table 3, including lattice constant a0 (Å),
bulk moduli B0 (GPa), and cohesive energy Ec (Ry/mol). The experimental results are also
included in Table 3 for comparison. The elastic constant for BeO is listed in Table 4. To evaluate our
potential parameters, some reported data for the theoretical and experimental
elastic constants are also included. It can be seen that our results
calculated using the fitted parameters are close to the other theoretical
data and experimental results.

a To evaluate our potential parameters,
some reported data for the theoretical and experimental elastic constants
are also included. It can be seen that our results calculated using
the fitted parameters are close to the other theoretical data and
experimental results. The unit for elastic parameters Cxx is GPa.

2.2 Potential Fitting
The potential fitting
started from the lattice constant, which is the fundamental property
of materials. The structure of BeO, as shown in Figure 1, is fully relaxed, and the structure parameters
such as the equilibrium lattice constant (a), cohesive
energy (Ec), and bulk modulus (B) are listed in Table 1. The previous experimental results and other theoretical
data are also given for comparison. In our calculations, the lattice
constant is first optimized by the first-principles calculations.
The calculated results show that the lattice constants optimized by
DFT are a = b = 2.71 Å and c = 4.41 Å, which are slightly larger than the experimental
values of a = b = 2.70 Å, and c = 4.38 Å. It is a common characteristic that the
generalized gradient approximation Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) function32 usually overestimated
the lattice constant compared to the experimental data.

Figure 1 Crystal structure
of wurtzite BeO from (a) the side view and (b)
the corresponding unit cell; the blue and yellow spheres represent
Be and O atoms, respectively.

With the optimized lattice constant, the energy surface of
BeO
is then calculated by the DFT calculations, which is used for the
fitting lattice constant by the GULP (general utility lattice program)
code.33Figure 2 shows the calculated energy as a function
of volume, and both the DFT and fitted results are shown for comparison.
It can be seen that the energy surface exhibits a parabolic curve
as a function of volume, and the lowest energy represents the most
stable structure corresponding to the optimized lattice constant.
Compared to the DFT results, the MEAM data exhibit a left shift toward
the small volume direction due to the slightly smaller lattice constant.
This is reasonable because the DFT lattice constants are slightly
larger than the experimental results, that is, 0.37% larger for a and b and 0.685% larger for c. Importantly, the fitted MEAM data of the energy surface exhibit
a similar curve to the DFT one, which indicates that the fitted bulk
moduli will have similar values compared with the DFT results. The
bulk modulus can be obtained by the fitting of energy as a function
of volume based on the EOS (empirical equations of state) equations.34

Figure 2 Energy of BeO as a function of volume calculated by the
first-principles
calculation and MEAM potential.

Besides the lattice constant, the bond length and angles
between
atoms are also important for the characterization of BeO structure.
Compared with the Be–Be bond and O–O bond, the Be–O
bond has the smallest bond length, and the charge density analysis
indicates that the bond of Be–O is stronger than the other
two kinds of bonds. In other words, the interaction between Be and
O atoms is very important for the BeO structure. Thus, the Be–O
bond will be the main focus in this work. It should be mentioned that
the BeO structure is not a perfect hexagonal structure, and the value
of c/a is 1.624 (calculated by first-principles
calculation), which is not equal to the ideal value of 1.633. For
the Be–O bond, the first-principles calculations show that
there are two types of bond for Be–O in the unit cell. The
bond length along the z direction (c direction) is 1.664 Å, while the length of the bond in the x–y plane (a–b plane) is 1.656 Å, as shown in Figure 1. For the MEAM potential, our fitting results
show that the bond length along the z direction is
1.602 Å, while the length of the bond in the x–y plane is 1.645 Å.

To better
compare the fitted results with the DFT results, the
pair correlation function is also calculated as shown in Figure 3. Note that the MD
result is in a dynamic state at room temperature, while the DFT data
is in a static state at 0 K. Compared with the DFT results, the values
of the three peaks for the MD results are different, and the location
site as a function of distance shows a shift to the direction of the
small value. This is reasonable since the atoms vibrate much harder
at the equilibrium position with increasing temperature, which leads
to the increase in the width of the peaks as seen in Figure 3. Moreover, the different location
sites are due to the fact that the optimized lattice constant by the
MEAM is smaller than that by the first-principles calculations.

by DFT at 0 K and MD simulation at 300 K.

2.3 Predictions of Thermodynamic Properties
Next, we consider the linear expansion of the BeO structure. The
expansion can reveal the size change of materials with the temperature,
which is very important for the application for materials. In the
atomic point of view, it responds to the rate of change in kinetic
energy of the atom with the temperature. The expansion coefficient
α can be obtained by the formula 1  where P is
the pressure. Figure 4 shows the increase in linear expansion as a function of temperature
averaged over 10 randomly generated 6 × 4 × 4 supercell.
The calculated results by the MEAM potential are scaled by a factor
of 0.8 to account for the possible effects caused by the impurities
in the experimental samples, the experimental errors, and the difference
between the idealized atomic scale models and the bulk material of
BeO in the whole temperature region. The experimental data35,36 and other theoretical calculations25 are
also included. At the temperature range from 300 to 1200 K, a linear
trend is observed. Then, the slope of increase changes at the temperature
range between 1100 and 1800 K. After 1800 K, the slope changes again,
and the experimental data also show some differences, which may be
caused by the defect in the samples. The MEAM results with the abovementioned
scaling factor show a good agreement with the experimental data.

Figure 4 Linear
expansion coefficient of BeO as a function of temperature.
Experimental results are also plotted for comparison.

Figure 5 shows the
enthalpy increase as a function of temperature. Similar to the lattice
constant, the enthalpy increases linearly with the temperature increase
at the low-temperature region. However, there is a sharp increase
in the enthalpy at the temperature range between 500 and 2000 K. Using
the Bunsen ice calorimeter and the drop method, Victor and Douglas37 measured the enthalpy of BeO relative to 273
K. Besides, the enthalpy of BeO is measured by Greenbaum et al.38 at the high-temperature region. To better compare
our results with the experimental data, the enthalpy for the BeO is
calculated relative to room temperature (300 K), as shown in Figure 5. The calculated
values show a good agreement with the experimental results,30 especially at the low- and high-temperature
region. The fitted experimental data is the mean enthalpy of the sample
based on the least squares. At the middle-temperature region, the
calculated results and experimental data show a small difference.
However, if we consider the density of the single crystal in the experimental
samples and the experimental error, then it is a reason for the existing
small difference.

Figure 5 Enthalpy of BeO as a function of temperature relative
to room temperature.

The specific heat capacity of a material is defined as the
heat
required to raise the temperature of unit mass of a given substance
by 1°. It should be mentioned that the temperature dependence
of specific heat capacity is very important for BeO to be applied
as a nuclear fuel additive. The heat capacity Cp is then calculated using the first derivative of enthalpy H as a function of temperature at constant pressure with
the following formula 2  where n is
the number of mole and T is the temperature. Figure 6 shows the calculated
heat capacity as a function of temperature. Around room temperature,
there are some differences between our results and the experimental
data, and the capacities at the low-temperature region calculated
by the MD are overestimated than the experimental data. The difference
may come from the derivation process since the small difference in
enthalpy may lead to a big difference in the heat capacity data. However,
at the temperature range from 600 to 2800 K, our results calculated
using the fitted potential show a good agreement with the experimental37,39 and theoretical data.20

Figure 6 Heat capacity of BeO
as a function of temperature.

Heat transfer is one of the most important properties for
BeO.
The experimental3,40,41 and theoretical studies24 show that the
thermal conductivity of BeO is about 300 W/(m K) at room temperature,
which can be comparable to that of the metal materials, such as aluminum
and silver. Unlike the metal materials of which heat is mainly transported
by electrons, the BeO system transports heat mainly by phonons since
BeO is an insulating material with a large band gap of about 10 eV.5,6 After the calculation of the lattice constant, elastic constant,
expansion, enthalpy, and heat capacity, the reliability of the potential
has been verified. In this section, the potential is used for the
calculation of thermal conductivity. In the MD simulations, the lattice
thermal conductivity can be obtained by the EMD method with the following
relationship 3  where V is
the system volume, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, T is the system temperature, J is the heat current, τm is the integration time,
and the angular brackets denote an average over time in the MD simulation. Figure 7 shows the calculated
thermal conductivity as a function of temperature. For a better comparison,
the experimental data and other theoretical results are also plotted
in Figure 7. In the
whole-temperature region, the thermal conductivity decreases with
increasing temperature, which is not like the metal material. This
is reasonable because, in the BeO system, the phonon transport is
dominant and the u process plays an important role
in heat transport. The calculated results by the MEAM potential are
scaled by a factor of 0.8 to account for the possible effects caused
by the impurities in the experimental samples, the experimental errors,
and the difference between the idealized atomic scale models and the
bulk material of BeO in the whole-temperature region. We can see that
our results show the same trend as the experimental data. The MEAM
results with the abovementioned scaling factor show a good agreement
with the experimental data. Compared with the experimental data, our
results are reasonable since the experimental sample usually has some
defects such as vacancy, impurity, and grain boundary, which block
the heat transfer.

3 Conclusions
The MEAM potential parameters are developed to describe the interactions
of atoms for the BeO system. The first-principles calculations and
experimental data are used for the determination of the potential
parameters. The fitted potential shows good performance on the lattice
constant and elastic constant. Besides, the temperature dependence
of dynamic properties such as expansion, enthalpy, and heat capacity
calculated by this potential is also tested and compared with the
reported experimental and theoretical data. The good agreements between
the calculated results and experimental data further validate the
potential models. Finally, the potential has been used to predict
the thermal conductivity of BeO, which is very important for its heat
transfer applications in the energy field. The calculated results
show a good agreement with the experimental data as a function of
temperature. Furthermore, the potential can be used to study large
systems with defects and help to understand the dynamic progress from
the atomic aspect.

4 Methods
The structure
optimization of BeO is calculated by using a plane
wave pseudopotential formulation42−44 within the framework
of the DFT. The code is implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP). The exchange–correlation energy is in the form
of PBE function32 with the generalized
gradient approximation (GGA). The cutoff energy for the plane wave
expansion is 400 eV. The k points are sampled on
a uniform grid of 15 × 15 × 7. The system is fully relaxed
until the magnitude of the forces acting on all the atoms becomes
less than 0.001 eV/Å. For the heat transport, the lattice thermal
conductivity is predicted using the equilibrium molecular dynamics
(EMD) simulations combined with the Green–Kubo autocorrelation
decay method.45 The MEAM potential46 is used to describe the interatomic interactions,
and the time step is set to 0.5 fs. After a constant temperature simulation
of 500,000 steps and a constant energy simulation of 400,000 steps,
the heat current data are collected to calculate the heat current
autocorrelation function.

To describe the atomic interaction
in a BeO system, the MEAM potential
is applied to describe the atomic interaction. Here, we applied the
potential with the form as in ref (46), which is successfully used to describe the
metal47,48 and covalent compounds.49 In the MEAM potential, the total energy of the system can
be expressed as48,50−52 4  where the sums are
over the
atoms i and j, Fi is the embedding function, ρi is the background electron density of atom i, Sij is the screen parameter between atom i and atom j with the distance Rij, and φij is the atomic interaction between two atoms. Thus, the energy of
a single atom i can be expressed as 5  where Ziis the number of nearest neighbors
in the structure. It
should be mentioned that the function F has many
different forms, such as power law, Johnson, VBO, and Baskes. However,
for the pair interactions φij, there
is no mathematical form. To obtain the φij between two atoms, the reference structure was constructed
with the known energy. Using the energy expression (eq 5), the energy of the reference structure
can be expressed as 6  where Eiu can also
be obtained by the zero-temperature universal equation of state by
Rose et al.53 as a function of R. 7  where d is
an adjustable parameter and 8  and 9  where B is
the bulk modulus, and Ω is the equilibrium atomic volume. In
our work, we also used the first-principles calculations to calculate
the value of Eiu, which could provide a reliable accuracy in determining
the parameter α and re.

Combined
with eq 6, the pair interaction
φij can
be derived as 10  Then, we can obtain
that 11  Therefore, the energy of
the system can be rewritten as a function of the density of the background
electron. In this work, the embedding function of Baskes form is used 12  where A is
a fitting parameter and Ec is the cohesive
energy of the compounds. The background electron density ρ̅i is composed of a spherically symmetric partial
electron density ρ0 and angular contributions ρi1, ρi2, and ρi3. ρ0 has no angular dependency of electron density 13  where ri is the distance between atom i and
other
atoms. The angular contributions can be expressed as follows 14   15   16  where α, β, and γ represent three different
directions. The above formulas show that ρa has an exponential relationship with rj. Then, the electron density can be expressed as the following
form 17  where βa is the attenuation coefficient.
Here, we assume
that the contribution to the total electron density coming from the
angle item is small. Under this assumption, the total background electron
density can be expressed as 18  where G(Γ)
can be described as 19  where Γ can be expressed
as 20  where ta is the fitted parameter related
to the electron density.
In the MEAM, a screening function Sij is
introduced to describe the cutoff for the many-body interactions.
For arbitrary two atoms i and j in
the compounds, the screening function Sij can be expressed as 21  where Sikj is the screening factor that denotes the
influence of neighbor
atoms k to the atoms i and j. To obtain the value of Sikj, the following geometric construction is adopted from ref (54). Imagine an ellipse on
the x and y plane, passing through
atoms i, k, and j with the x axis of the ellipse determined by atoms i and j. The equation of the ellipse is
given by 22  where the value of the parameter C is related to the coordinate positions of the three atoms i, j, and k, as follows 23  where Xik = (Rik/Rij)2 and Xkj = (Rkj/Rij)2. The screening factor Sikj is defined
as a function of C as follows 24  where Cmin and Cmax are
the limiting values
of C determining the extent of screening, and the
smooth cutoff function is 25  In the following part, the
physical meaning of the screening factor is explained. Cmax and Cmin determine the
maximum and minimum area of the ellipse, respectively. If the atom k is outside the maximum area, then the atom k has no effect on the interaction between atoms i and j (Sikj = 1). If
the atom k is inside the minimum area, then atoms i and j have no interactions at all (Sikj = 0). If the atom k is
located at the position between the minimum and maximum area, then
the interactions between atoms i and j change gradually with the coordinate position of atom k.
