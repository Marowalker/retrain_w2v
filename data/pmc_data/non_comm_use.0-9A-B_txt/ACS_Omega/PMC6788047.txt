We demonstrate here a facile hydrothermal-assisted
formation of
PtCo alloy nanoparticles (NPs) and their simultaneous anchoring on
the graphitic surface of N-doped graphene oxide (NGO). Doping induced
nanopores in the carbon surface to facilitate the uniform and homogeneous
anchoring of alloy nanoparticles. It was revealed that the formation
of PtCo NPs on an NGO interface plodded excellent tendency toward
double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA). The dsDNA immobilization
was enabled by the presence of several oxidation states of Pt and
Co. The same property was further used to monitor the direct detection
of dsDNA damage induced by clenbuterol via screen-printed carbon electrodes.
Cyclic voltammetric and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic characterization
traced well the dsDNA attachment on the modified electrode surface.
Differential pulsed voltammetry was further used as a tool to monitor
the characteristic guanine peak before and after incubating with clenbuterol
used as a damage probe for the dsDNA. The findings can further be
appurtenant in exploring dsDNA immobilization protocols and developing
analytical methods for determination of various dsDNA damaging agents.

Introduction
Recently, numerous
efforts have been devoted to the quest of finding
newer therapeutic agents and probes to understand the DNA sequencing
and specific genetic information. Efficient immobilization has been
the matter of interest for several researchers. Direct adsorption,
covalent binding, and probe conjugation are the widely used methodologies
in these lines.1 Several organic and inorganic
molecular species and hybrid materials have been used as an immobilizing
support for this purpose.2 Among these,
due to their water solubility, tunable molecular architecture, inertness,
and stability under physiological conditions, the transition metals
have been proven to be the ideal candidates for site-specific DNA
binding.3 In this direction, cobalt metal
(Co) being widely distributed in several biological systems have attracted
much attention to study their interactions with DNA. Several covalent
and noncovalent interactions of Co and double-stranded deoxyribonucleic
acid (dsDNA) bases have been reported, indicating the great tendency
of Co to interact with dsDNA.4 Another
extensively studied metal for DNA interaction and binding is platinum
(Pt). Pt has demonstrated an ample tendency, either in the form of
mononuclear or bimodal complexes both via covalent and intercalation
interactions.3,5

Moreover, DNA–metal
interactions due to the phosphatic oxygen
and nitrogen atoms of DNA bases have widely been explored for sensitive
and specific detection of several effectors. These belong to both
environmental and biological backgrounds,6 which may damage the dsDNA in terms of distorting the nucleotide
sequence or their hydrogen bonding.7 To
study the quantitative damage of immobilized DNA under the influence
of external co-factors, efficient dsDNA immobilization is necessary.8 Likewise, to limit the catalytic loading and
increase the surface area of a substrate, the deposition of monolayers,
submonolayers, and nanoparticles of bimetallic lineage over a variety
of support materials has been widely explored.9 Engineering the electronegative environment of transition metals
in alloy formation could tune up their physical and chemical properties
according to the substrate requirements.10 However, very less efforts have been exerted to utilize such transition
metal alloy nanoparticles as a DNA immobilization support. Besides
the great affinity of dsDNA toward heavy metals, they can mitigate
its structure as well, causing carcinogenesis.11 The elaborated quantification of dsDNA–metal complexation
consequently could be a matter of great concerns to tailor as a useful
analytical tool. Few efforts have been exerted for spectroscopic interactions
of DNA with metallic and bimetallic complexes.12 Likewise, tailored designing of binuclear and polynuclear
complexes with larger surface area, higher charge distribution, and
desirable electronic structures renders efficient probes for dsDNA.13 Therefore, electrochemical-based studies of
DNA immobilized on metal surfaces can potentially integrate several
benefits including precise detection and higher sensitivity and specificity.

In these lines, to further tune up the functionality of metal nanoparticles
and reduce the dosage of precious metals, higher conductivity and
surface area are highly desirable.14 Owing
to its large surface area and excellent thermal, optical, electrical,
and mechanical properties, graphene has received enormous attention
since its discovery.15 It has been used
as a support material for many applications with the benefits of uniform
dispersion and enhanced intrinsic properties of graphene. Moreover,
in the process of metal anchoring on the graphitic surface, various
functionalities and lattice defects of graphene oxide can help in
uniform immobilization of metal nanoparticles.16

The aim of this study is to synthesize more effective
and comprehensive
metal-based substrates for dsDNA immobilization. The bimetallic nanoparticles
anchored on the graphene basal plan could develop newer bioaffinity
protocols to electrochemically monitor the double-stranded DNA immobilization.
Herein, a facile methodology for uniformly anchored PtCo nanoparticles
onto N-doped graphene oxide has been reported. The doped nitrogen
atoms play a decisive role in the uniform anchoring of Co atoms followed
by the Pt attachment and overall morphology of the nanostructure.

Results
and Discussion
The in situ synthesis of PtCo bimetallic nanoparticles
onto the
N-doped graphene oxide is illustrated in Figure 1. N doping resulted in the enhanced conjugation
effect of basal π electrons and lone pair electrons of nitrogen.
Such an electron-rich environment of N-doped graphene oxide provides
the ease of Co and Pt coordination and eventually provides more anchoring
sites to the Pt and Co atoms on the basal plane.17

followed by immobilization of dsDNA and clenbuterol-induced DNA damage
studies.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman
spectroscopy, and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) were used to investigate the molecular interactions
and atomic-scale changes on the basal plane, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure S1. In the XRD patterns of NGO-PtCo and
NGO, the appearance of a band at 26° represented the (002) diffraction
of graphene, whereas four peaks corresponding to (111), (200), (220),
and (311) planes of Pt were also evidenced along with a Co representative
band at 46°. Similarly, changes in the ID/IG ratio of the Raman
spectra of both NGO (0.97) and NGO-PtCo (1.04) indicated the structural
influence of PtCo nanoparticles onto the NGO. Consistent with the
literature, anchoring of PtCo NPs decreased the ID and corroborated
an increase in the IG band of graphene. In the FTIR spectra, the presence
of the peaks at 1226, 1403, 1727, and 3405 cm–1 can
be attributed to stretching vibrations of O–H, C=O,
and O–H (deformation) and stretching vibration of C–OH,
respectively. Moreover, the appearance of a skeletal vibrational peak
of graphene at 1560 cm–1 under the influence of
PtCo anchoring confirmed the NGO-PtCo synthesis, as shown in Figure S1.18

Figure 2 (A) XRD pattern
and (B) Raman spectra of NGO and NGO-PtCo hybrid
materials, indicating the successful growth of PtCo nanoparticles
on the NGO surface.

To determine the NGO-PtCo
surface states and binding energies,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed as shown in Figure 2 and Figure S2. Four distinct peaks at 284.50, 285.41,
286.54, and 289.21 eV were deconvoluted after carefully treating the
raw data, which could be attributed to the C=C, C=N,
C–OH, and O=C= bonds of the NGO-PtCo19 (Figure 3B). It is noteworthy that the similar peaks were obtained
during the investigation of NGO XPS spectra (Figure 3A). However, the increase in binding energy
of Pt4f core levels for the NGO-PtCo composite with respect to that
of pure Pt, and the peak intensity and peak-to-peak ratio difference
collectively indicate the presence of electronic species around the
sp2 carbons.20 Further XPS investigations
of NGO-PtCo graphed doublet peaks for Pt4f, which were further deconvoluted
into several pairs of doublets, indicating the presence of Pt in multiple
states. The intensive doublet at 74.41 and 72.10 eV represents the
zerovalent metallic state, while the less intense set of peaks at
75.51 and 72.75 eV indicates the existence of the +2 oxidation state
of Pt. Similarly, Co2p3/2 spectra were fit with three peaks
at 773.06 (Co metal), 783.04 (Co(II)), and 795.36 (Co(III)).19b Furthermore, detailed comparisons of different
states of NGO and NGO-PtCo, for example, N1s and O1s, were also performed
and shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information, confirming the PtCo alloy formation.

spectra of (C) Pt4f and (D) Co2p3/2 of NGO-PtCo. Both fitted
data and deconvoluted fitting components are presented here.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy
(TEM) also depicted the heterostructure of uniformly distributed PtCo
NPs onto the graphene basal plane. As shown in Figure 4a, the SEM micrograph indicates the abundance
of PtCo NPs uniformly adsorbed across the entire basal plane of graphene
with a uniform particle diameter of about 10 nm. The elemental mapping
of SEM images for N, Pt, and Co also indicates the uniformity of the
elemental distribution throughout the graphitic substrate (Figure 4). Likewise, the
TEM micrographs also supported these observations. A nearly transparent
graphene film with highly dispersed uniform NPs throughout the graphene
surface can be evidenced by TEM (Figure 4b) and HRTEM (Figure 4c,d). Notably, it is evident in TEM and HRTEM
micrographs of NGO-PtCo that negligible nanoparticles are scattered
out of the graphene surface, which indicates the strong interaction
between alloy nanoparticles and the graphene substrate. Likewise,
the spacing measurements of lattice fringes with HRTEM rendered a d spacing value of 0.22 nm, a characteristic of face-centered
Pt (111). For comparison, SEM and TEM investigation of NGO were also
performed, which presented a clear picture of pristine nitrogen-doped
graphene films, with the appearance of nanopores. These defects formed
by N doping eventually facilitated PtCo NP formation and anchoring
on the graphitic surface. Similarly, the TEM analysis of PtCo anchored
graphene (PtCo-G) prepared under similar conditions showed ununiform
PtCo NPs with poor dispersity, as shown in Figure S3c. These observations furthermore supported our hypothesis
of the influence of N doping onto the morphology and successful anchoring
of alloy NPs.17,21

spectrometry) elemental mapping analysis for N, Pt, and Co elements

Furthermore, dsDNA immobilization
was monitored via changes in
electron/charge transfer ability (CV spectra) and electron resistance
(EIS curves) of NGO-PtCo in 1 mM solution of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–, as shown in Figure 5. The NGO-PtCo-modified screen-printed electrode
demonstrated the ease of electron transfer by showing the increased
CV response as compared to the bare electrode. The redox current of
ferro/ferricyanide (redox probes) was enormously increased, while
the electron resistance value was decreased on modification of electrode
with NGO-PtCo (Figure 5a). The DNA immobilization caused a decrease in the redox current
and an increase in electron transfer resistance (Figure 5b), confirming the success
of dsDNA adsorption onto the NGO-PtCo NPs. As a proof of concept to
demonstrate the DNA immobilization, DNA was incubated on the bare
screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE), where there was a small peak
at 1.2 V corresponding to the adenine of the adsorbed DNA (Figure S4). To validate the hypothesis of better
dsDNA immobilization on NGO-PtCo-modified electrodes and identify
the electrochemical signals of damaged DNA, we performed control experiments
with dsDNA and CLB on bare electrodes, as shown in Figure S4. The results demonstrated clear evidence of the
influence of NGO-PtCo on dsDNA immobilization. Moreover, a peak for
damaged DNA (guanine peak at 0.55 V) was clearly differentiable from
the oxidation peak (0.67 V) of amino groups of CLB. The quenching
in the electron transfer could be attributed to the bulky DNA molecules
hindering the redox probe to be reached at the conducting interface
of the modified SPCE.22 Moreover, the incubation
of dsDNA-modified SPCE in CLB caused damage of dsDNA, leaving the
space for probe approach for electronic interaction and resulting
in an increase in the electron transfer and a decrease in resistance
(Figure 5d). On more
reason for the increase in the electron transfer could be due to the
influence of protein adsorption. As proteins have characteristics
of charge transfer, the immobilization cause an increase in the conductivity.23

(c) dsDNA-immobilized modified electrode, and (d) CLB-treated dsDNA
immobilized modified electrode. All the measurements were performed
at 50 mV s–1 in 1 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–.

On similar lines, the differential
pulsed voltammetry (DPV) was
also used to monitor the dsDNA immobilization followed by damage caused
by clenbuterol (CLB). An adenine characteristic peak at 1.2 was observed
when dsDNA was incubated either on the bare electrode (Figure 6Ad) or the NGO-PtCo-modified
electrode (Figure 6Ab). NGO-PtCo, being electroactive in nature, caused a broader peak
appearance in the range of 1.1–1.3, which engulfed the characteristic
peak of adenine in the case of curves b and c; however, the surface
changes were clearly indicated by the change in the peak intensity
in that area. On incubation with CLB, the intensity of adenine peak
was decreased, and a new peak at 0.55 V emerged, denoted as a characteristic
peak of the guanine base of DNA (Figure 6Ac).24 It is noteworthy
that the guanine peak was absent before CLB incubation (Figure 6Ab), which could be attributed
to the steric hindrance and bulkiness of the dsDNA proteins. A similar
trend was observed in the case of cyclic voltammograms of bare and
modified electrodes before and after incubation with clenbuterol (Figure 6B). The current response
was increased on modification with NGO-PtCo, indicating the increased
electron conductivity (Figure 6Bb). Moreover, the immobilization of dsDNA also corroborated
the electron conductivity, which could be attributed to the ease of
charge transfer in the case of protein presence. On incubation with
CLB, the peak at 0.8 V was incredibly increased, indicating the availability
of more proteins to the surface of the electrode (Figure 6Bc). This increase in the peak
current could be attributed to the CLB-based dsDNA damage, resulting
in more proteins available for adsorption on the electrode surface.
CLB causes distortion of H bonding of complementary bases of dsDNA.25 Several graphene-based nanocomposites, including
Au/GO/MoS2 and electroconverted Au NP/graphene films, have
so far been used for the detection of a specific sequence of DNA,
leading to the DNA damage.26 Moreover,
several reports have demonstrated the use of graphene and metal nanocomposites
for DNA hybridization studies.27 Biomolecule-
and molecular beacon-probed graphene nanocomposites are yet another
root for the detection of colorimetric-based DNA damage.28 Recently, multicomponent-based graphene nanocomposites
(graphene/ionic liquid/Nafion/hemin/cytosine Ag ions) have also been
used in different types of DNA damage investigations.29 However, due to unique morphological features and characteristic
affinities of Pt and Co toward DNA, the synthesized nanocomposite
could provide better DNA adsorption as compared to the already reported
adsorbents.27b,30 The efficient immobilization
of biomolecules due to unique morphological properties of uniformly
distributed alloy nanoparticles is the advantage of the current ternary
nanohybrids toward DNA immobilization protocols.

Conclusions
We uniformly anchored here the uniformly distributed PtCo bimetallic
nanoparticles onto the N-doped graphene oxide substrate and further
accessed its affinity toward dsDNA attachment. The affinity of nucleotide
bases toward the NGO-PtCo nanocomposite was further examined via electrochemical
studies of a screen-printed interface modified with NGO-PtCo. Moreover,
nanocomposite-assisted dsDNA immobilized electrodes were investigated
for DNA damage studies under the influence of clenbuterol via electrochemical
differential pulsed voltammetry. From our observations, it can be
concluded that alloy NP-anchored graphene can represent a suitable
and sensitive tool for the immobilization of dsDNA, and the same could
efficiently be used in the detection of DNA damaging agents.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of PtCo Anchored N-Doped Graphene Oxide (NGO-PtCo)
Prior to N doping, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized via the
Hummers’ method with slight modifications.31 Typically, for N doping, 4 mL of GO aqueous suspension
(5 mg/mL) was dispersed in 30 mL of water followed by the addition
of 6 g of urea (200 mg/mL as a N precursor) and stirred for 3 h. Then,
the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave
(100 mL), and hydrothermal treatment of the reaction mixture was performed
at 180 °C for 5 h. The resultant mixture was then centrifuged
and washed with water and ethanol followed by vacuum drying at 55
°C to get a black powder termed as NGO. To further synthesize
PtCo-grafted NGO, 100 mg of as prepared NGO was dispersed in 400 mL
of ethanol followed by the addition of PtCl4 (100 mg),
CoCl2·6H2O (40 mg), and sodium acetate
(700 mg) under vigorous stirring. As a reducing agent, NaBH4 was quickly introduced to the reaction mixture, and the resultant
mixture was stirred for 4 h at room temperature. Finally, the product
was collected and washed via centrifugation in plenty of deionized
water and ethanol.

dsDNA Immobilization and Damage Studies
To evaluate
the bimetallic nanoparticles as a reinforcement for dsDNA adsorption
onto the graphene substrate surface, an adequate amount of dsDNA (dissolved
in 50 mM NaCl solution) was incubated for several hours onto the working
interface of the carbon-printed electrode. Prior to further treatment
of dsDNA-modified electrodes, they were water washed and immersed
in a working buffer (0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 4.4) to remove unbonded
dsDNA and NaCl crystals. Thirty microliters of clenbuterol (CLB; 2
× 10–5 M) was then incubated on the modified
electrode for a time of 120 s followed by rinsing with distilled water.
The obvious changes in cyclic voltammetry (CV)-based and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-based electrochemical responses on dsDNA
immobilization evidenced the easy and successful immobilization of
dsDNA on the NGO-PtCo surface. All the cyclic voltammetric studies
were performed at scan rate of 50 mV s–1 in 1 mM
[Fe(CN)6]3–/4–. The modified electrodes
were eventually scanned for differential pulsed voltammetry (DPV)
in 100 μL of acetate buffer (pH 4.4). The appearance of an intrinsic
guanine peak in DPV measurements, which were absent before CLB treatment,
indicated the damage of dsDNA and hence the successful immobilization
of dsDNA onto the NGO-PtCo. The same was also observed with cyclic
voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies.
