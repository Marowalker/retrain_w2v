Scheelea phalerata Mart. ex Spreng
(Arecaceae) is a palm tree found in the Brazilian cerrado. There are
no topics related to volatile oils from S. phalerata leaves in the literature. This work determines its chemical composition
and evaluates the biological activity under two different seasonal
conditions (dry and rainy seasons). The dry essential oil yield was
0.034 ± 0.001% and the rainy essential oil yield was 0.011 ±
0.003%. Both essential oils presented different qualitative and quantitative
compositions (99.4 and 98.5%). The main constituents of the dry essential
oil were phytol (36.7%), nonadecane (9.7%), linolenic acid (9.1%),
(Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol (4.2%), and squalene (4.0%). The
main constituents of the rainy essential oil were phytol (26.1%),
palmitic acid (18.7%), hexan-1-ol (15.6%), (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol
(9.7%), and oleic acid (4.0%). The antileishmanial activity against
promastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis was observed only for the rainy season essential oil (IC50 value of 165.05 ± 33.26 μg mL–1). A
molecular docking study showed that alcohols exert a paramount efficacy
and that the action of some essential oil compounds may be similar
to that of amphotericin B. Still, only the essential oil from the
dry season showed moderate antibacterial activity against S. sanguinis (MICs 200–400 μg mL–1). The cytotoxicity against Vero cells was identical
(>512) for both essential oils. The novel data here for both chemical
characterization and biological activity, in particular, evidence
that the action of these compounds is similar to that of amphotericin
B, provide valuable information to the drug-discovery field.

Introduction
Neglected tropical diseases affect between
700 000 and 1
million people around the world, with 26 000–65 000
deaths annually. Among these tropical diseases, one transmitted by
the protozoa of the genus Leishmania stands out.
This disease affects socially vulnerable human populations in countries
such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, Iraq, and the
Syrian Arab Republic. Between 600 000 and 1 million new cases
occurred worldwide annually.1−3 This situation may become more
critical in the coming years. Therefore, searching for compounds or
prototypes for the development of new potentially bioactive molecules
may be important for the survival of future generations.

Palm
tree species are widely distributed in the southeastern and
midwestern regions of Brazil and produce edible fruits rich in lipids,
carbohydrates, and fiber.4 Among the palm
tree species, Scheelea phalerata Mart.
ex Spreng (Arecaceae), well known as “bacuri”, has significant
economic value. The literature shows that the oil extracted from the
“bacuri” fruit is rich in carotenoid oleic acid, a monounsaturated
fatty acid. This oil is beneficial to human health and is used in
dermatological products for babies as an antipyretic agent and to
relieve lung congestion and arthritis. The oil is also used in the
production of biodiesel.5−7 Previous studies have been conducted
on the chemical composition of its fixed oils.5,8 However,
there are still no reports in the literature of the chemical composition
of the essential oils from the leaves of S. phalerata and their biological activities.

The literature reports some
bioactivity of the Arecaceae family
plant against Leishmania amazonensis. The oils from the Palmae are also used for such purposes, that
is, Coccos nucifera (Arecaceae), which
showed activity against Leishmania amazonensis.9 Additionally, the oils of Cocos nucifera (coconut pulp) presented antimicrobial
activity against A. niger, S. typhi, and S. aureus,(10) showing the potential of the compounds
found in this family with notable biological activities. Promastigote
forms of Leishmania amazonensis were
treated with different concentrations of the aqueous extract from Syagrus coronata (Arecaceae). The toxicity of the
polymeric procyanidin-rich crude aqueous extract toward Leishmania amazonensis with concomitant macrophage
activation and no allergic reactions in vivo demonstrated the potential
use of S. coronate (licuzeiro), another
Palmae tree, as a leishmanicidal drug.11

Considering the potential of bioactivity already confirmed
for
some species of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the need to search
for new molecules that act against microorganisms, the purpose of
this work was to determine the chemical constitution of the essential
oils from the leaves of Scheelea phalerata in different seasonal periods (dry and rainy conditions) and to
evaluate, in vitro, their antileishmanial, antibacterial, and cytotoxic
activities. Additionally, molecular docking analysis aimed to clarify
the behavior of the major components that present optimal biological
activity, which is an unprecedented verification for the volatiles
of this species.

Results and Discussion
Yield and Chemical Composition
of the Essential Oils
The yields of the leaf essential oils
were 0.034 ± 0.001 (%w/w
± SD) in the dry season and 0.011 ± 0.003 (%w/w ± SD)
in the rainy season. Both essential oils presented different qualitative
and quantitative compositions (99.4 and 98.5%, respectively). Significant
differences were observed in the yields between essential oils with
respect to the period of collection, showing that the synthesis of
essential oils for this species is influenced, probably, by humidity
among other factors.

The essential oil collected during the
dry season revealed the presence of 25 compounds (Table 1). The main constituents of
the dry essential oil were phytol (36.7%), nonadecane (9.7%), linolenic
acid (9.1%), (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol (4.2%), and squalene
(4.0%). For the essential oil collected during the rainy season, 24
compounds were found. The main constituents for the rainy essential
oil were phytol (26.1%), palmitic acid (18.7%), hexan-1-ol (15.6%),
(Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol (9.7%), and oleic acid (4.0%).
A change in the biosynthesis of compounds of greater abundance was
observed probably due to the environmental conditions at the seasonal
periods studied; only phytol was maintained as the most abundant bioactive
compound for both essential oils. This compound is biosynthesized
by both mevalonic acid and 2-C-methylerythritol-4-phosphate pathways,12 and although ubiquitous in plants as a constituent
of chlorophyll, it rarely occurs naturally in its free form.13−15 Many pharmacological activities of phytol and its derivatives are
well known, including antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antitumorous, antimutagenic,
antiteratogenic, antibiotic–chemotherapeutic, antidiabetic,
lipid-lowering, antispasmodic, anticonvulsant, antinociceptive, antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, antidepressant, immunoadjuvant, hair-growth-facilitating,
hair-loss defense, and antidandruff properties.12 The chemical class distribution of the volatile constituents
of S. phalerata in the dry and rainy
seasons is summarized in Table 1. It was observed that the terpenoid compounds were biosynthesized
in a major proportion in the rainy season (44.4 versus 27.5% in dry
season), probably due to luminosity-dependence factors inside glandular
trichomes, where specific terpenoid compounds are biosynthesized.16

Diterpenes
were highlighted in both seasonal periods, due to the
great representability of phytol, and also fatty acids, with 11.0
and 25.1% of compounds of this class in the dry and rainy seasons,
respectively. Classes of compounds differentially synthesized as a
consequence of the seasonal period were alkanes (19.6%) in the dry
season and alcohols (31.3%) in the rainy season. Alkanes are also
present in waxes and act as a protective barrier for the leaves.17 These compounds may have a particularly important
role during the dry season, avoiding loss of water due to their nonpolarity.
The higher proportion of alcohols in the rainy season may be due to
the fact that the humidity favors a greater proliferation of microorganisms,
and the plant requires compounds that act as antimicrobial agents.
Alcohols are a class of compounds that generally possess bactericidal
activity, for example, acting as protein-denaturing agents.18

Antileishmanial and Cytotoxic Activities
To determine
biological activities for the essential oils of the leaves from S. phalerata, the antileishmanial effects against Leishmania amazonensis were evaluated (Table 2). Additionally, the toxicity
of these essential oils was verified by the cytotoxicity test performed
using Vero cells.

Only the essential oil of the
rainy season presented inhibitory
activity against Leishmania amazonensis, suggesting that the compounds synthesized in higher concentrations
in this seasonal period may be related to the result found. Additionally,
the selectivity index (SI) for the rainy season essential oil was
positive (3.10), indicating specificity for the parasite in detriment
to the normal cell line evaluated (Table 2).

The rainy essential oil of S. phalerata is constituted of long-chain fatty acids
(25.1%) such as oleic acid
(4.0%), palmitic acid (18.7%), and oleic acid (4.0%), all of which
have already been associated with antileishmanial activity.22

There are no studies regarding the evaluation
of the isolated phytol
compounds against Leishmania species. However, this
major compound identified in the essential oil of S.
phalerata is also present in the hexane-rich fraction
of another species (Lacistema pubescens) that presented action against Leishmania amazonensis promastigote and amastigote forms.23 Therefore,
it appears that phytol is an important molecule in antileishmanial
activity, but the individual action of this compound seems insufficient,
since it is also present in the essential oil of the dry season in
high concentrations, and yet did not present any biological activity.
Another hypothesis is that other compounds present in the mixture
may disturb the phytol action by forming complexes, rendering this
molecule inactive.

Still, the essential oil from the dry season
presented very low
antileishmanial activity (IC50 > 512 μg mL–1). It is possible that the low concentration of fatty
acids in its
composition interferes with the biological activity.

Preliminary
Evidence of an Action Similar to that of Amphotericin
B in terms of Antileishmanial Activity
Leishmania parasites have a type of sterol in their membranes, ergosterol,
which is a lipid target of amphotericin B, a drug used for the treatment
of leishmaniasis.24 Amphotericin B is a
macrocyclic molecule derived from a natural product that has a biological
effect primarily through binding to ergosterol and permeating the
membrane via channel formation that represents a second complementary
mechanism, further increasing the drug potency.25,26 The amphotericin B molecule is composed of 37 carbon atoms forming
a closed macrocyclic ring by lactonization. It has a chain of unsubstituted
conjugated double bonds and, in the opposite portion, a polyhydroxylated
chain with seven free hydroxyl groups. At one end of the amphotericin
B molecule is present a mycosamine residue (lactone) with a free amine
group, forming a side chain.25 It is already
established that the mycosamine portion is critical for the amphotericin
B binding capacity and, thus, for forming possible hydrogen bonds
to ergosterol (Figure 1).25 This interaction allows further hydrophobic
interactions and penetration of the drug into the membrane. Once in
the membrane, amphotericin B molecules interact, forming a pore and
potentiating their biological activity.25

Amphotericin B structure and possible interactions of its mycosamine
portion with the molecule of ergosterol through hydrogen bonds; (B)
chemical structures of the four major compounds identified in the S. phalerata essential oil with antileishmanial action.

Molecular docking is a computational technique
that predicts the
interaction between small molecules and proteins or other macromolecules.
Hence, in this work, preliminary studies with molecular docking of
the alcohols and hydrophobic molecules present in the essential oils
from S. phalerata against ergosterol
showed different energy values (Figure 2). The binding energy (Eb; blue circles) of alcohols
are slightly lower in comparison with those of hydrophobic molecules,
with average values of −1.52 and −0.86 kcal/mol, respectively.
On the other hand, the intermolecular energy (Ei; red circles) showed
a notable difference between these molecules, with hydrophobic molecules
presenting an average value of −5.18 kcal/mol, which is 1.6-fold
lower than that of the alcohol molecules (−3.17 kcal/mol).
These results suggest that alcohol molecules present stronger types
of interactions, although their intermolecular interactions are weaker
in comparison with those of hydrophobic molecules. Therefore, these
molecules may interact in multiple ways: alcohols may form a hydrogen
bond with the polar/head portion of the ergosterol while the hydrophobic
molecules bind to the hydrophobic/body portion through hydrophobic
interactions.

Each docking value is presented by filled circles showing the binding
energy (Eb) in blue, the intermolecular energy (Ei) in red, and its
respective averages by unfilled black circles.

Alcohols are known modulators of membrane properties. For example,
alcohols can change the permeability and diffusion of a membrane,
thus affecting microorganisms.27 In the
context of the membrane environment, alcohol molecules may be essential
to the initial recognition of ergosterol molecules present in the
membrane, acting similar to the mycosamine portion of amphotericin
B and increasing the permeability and allowing further penetration
of the hydrophobic molecules. In this sense, the essential oils studied
in the present work may act simultaneously to express their biological
activity in Leishmania membranes. It is interesting
to note that the same two steps are observed in the amphotericin B
drug, suggesting that essential oils studied in the present work may
act in a way similar to that of the established drug, corroborating
the applicability of the technique to our problem. Thus, molecular
docking was important to give us insights into how the essential oil
from Scheelea phalerata can present
antileishmanial activity and how these molecules may act synergically,
being comparable to amphotericin B.

Antibacterial Activity
The results of the antibacterial
activities found for essential oils from the leaves of S. phalerata collected during the dry and rainy seasons
are shown in Table 3. The MIC results showed that better antibacterial activity was found
for the essential oil from the dry season.

This essential
oil showed moderate activity against all bacteria
evaluated, based on the classification of Holetz et al.,28 with MICs ranging from 200 to 400 μg mL–1. The essential oil from the rainy season showed no
antibacterial activity until the concentration of 400 μg mL–1. Particularly for essential oils, MIC values equal
to or below 2000 μg mL–1 can be considered
noteworthy for the antimicrobial activity.29

Some diterpenes have already been investigated for activity
against
oral microorganisms and exhibited strong and promising antibacterial
effects.30,31 Additionally, some studies indicate the
phytol compound as an important antimicrobial agent.32,33

A correlation between the antibacterial effect and phytol
compound
was observed in in silico model studies, where the activity of the
oils collected in different seasons was proportional to their concentration.34 In our work, and despite the considerable presence
of phytol in the S. phalerata rainy
essential oil, this compound did not show activity against the bacteria
until 400 μg mL–1. This fact may be related
to the contribution of the other major compounds, which are probably
working in unison.

Nonadecane and linolenic acid are also major
compounds present
in the essential oil collected during the dry season. The antibacterial
activities of linolenic acid are well known,35,36 and long-chain alkanes have already been confirmed as antimicrobial
agents.37 Lipophilic constituents present
in the essential oils inhibit microbial growth. The interaction of
these compounds with the lipid part of the cell membrane makes the
microbial cell more permeable, resulting in ion loss, enzymatic interruption,
and bacterial death. Additionally, essential oils are capable of inhibiting
the synthesis of RNA, DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides within the
bacterial cell.38 Further investigations
with respect to the compounds identified in S. phalerata should be conducted to better understand the actions against susceptible
bacteria.

Conclusions
This work reports for
the first time the chemical composition of
the leaf essential oils from Scheelea phalerata and their action on Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes and antibacterial activity. The essential oils from S. phalerata presented different constitutions as
a consequence of the seasonal effects, except for the phytol compound,
which was biosynthesized at high concentrations independent of the
collection period. The differences between the constituents reflected
in the antileishmanial and antibacterial activities. Hence, the rainy
season essential oil presented the best antileishmanial result (165.05
± 33.26 μg mL–1) and the dry season essential
oil showed the best antibacterial activity (200–400 μg
mL–1) compared with the rainy season essential oil
(>400 μg mL–1) against all bacteria tested.

Based on molecular docking analyses, alcohol compounds played a
fundamental role in the action of this oil against L. amazonensis, since they likely caused a disturbance
in the cell membrane through an interaction with ergosterol, allowing
the action of the other major compounds. This mechanism was observed
in the amphotericin B drug, whose intermediary equivalent to the action
of mycosamine would be the alcohol molecules, suggesting that the
essential oils from S. phalerata may
act in a way similar to that of a drug that is already well-established
in the treatment of leishmaniasis.

Experimental Section
Plant
Material
The leaves of S. phalerata were harvested in Araguari, Brazil, at coordinates 18°45′48.9″
S and 48°14′51.3″ W, and 1013 m of altitude, during
two different collection periods to observe seasonal effects: dry
season (September, 2015) and rainy season (January, 2016). A voucher
specimen of the plant material was deposited on the Herbarium of the
Federal University of Uberlândia (HUB), under the registration
number 71040, after authentication by the taxonomists of the HUB.
This plant was registered on the National System of Genetic Resource
Management and Associated Traditional Knowledge for Research (SYSGEN)
under the code AAA3202.

Essential Oil Extraction
Sheelea phalerata fresh leaves from each season were
air-dried under the shade for
1 week, cleaned, and cut into small pieces. The volatile oils were
obtained in a Clevenger-type apparatus using 400 g of sample and 2.0
L of distilled water for 4 h. Then, the essential oils were extracted
with 5.0 mL of dichloromethane. After dichloromethane evaporation,
the organic fraction was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and
kept frozen (−10 °C) until analysis. The percent yield
was calculated relative to the dried mass of the initial sample; this
procedure was performed in triplicate.

Essential Oil Characterization
The essential oil chemical
identification was carried out by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC17A/QP5010, Shimadzu, Japan), equipped with a DB-5 capillary column
(5% phenyl, 95% polydimethylsiloxane; J&W, 30 m × 0.25 mm
× 0.25 μm film thickness). The carrier gas was helium,
at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures
were 220 and 240 °C, respectively. The injection volume was 1.0
μL, and the split ratio was 1:20. The oven temperature was programmed
from 60 to 240 °C at a ramping rate of 3 °C/min. The electron
impact energy was set at 70 eV, and fragments from 40 to 650 Da were
collected. The identification of the chemical constituents was carried
out by a comparison with software libraries (Shim; Wiley139; Nist08;
Nist27). The arithmetic index (AI) was calculated according to the
equation proposed by Van Den Dool and Kratz.39 The identification was also based on a comparison of the mass spectral
fragmentation patterns, and the AI obtained was compared with AIs
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Wiley
275 library spectra.19,20 The quantification of each essential
oil was obtained by gas chromatography flame ionization (GC-FID) using
a Shimadzu GC2014 spectrometer and DB-5 capillary column under the
same conditions as for GC/MS, but nitrogen was used as the carrier
gas. Results represent average values of three experiments for each
seasonal essential oil.

Antileishmanial Activity
To test
for the effectiveness
against Leishmania amazonensis, the S. phalerata essential oils from the two different
seasons were solubilized in methanol (Merck KgaA, Germany) and diluted
with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma
Aldrich) in a stock solution at 1280 μg mL–1. The cell viability test was carried out using Leishmania
amazonensis in the promastigote stage (PH8 strain).
The analysis was performed using 96-well plates. Stock solutions of
the essential oil were added to the microplate, and serial dilutions
were made, with concentrations of 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, and 8
μg mL–1, but not exceeding a value of 3% for
methanol concentration. Then, a solution containing 1 × 108 parasites in 20 μL of the medium was pipetted into
each well and the plates were incubated for 48 h at 25 °C. Positive,
negative, and control samples were prepared on each plate, with amphotericin
B (AmBisome, Merck KgaA, Germany) for American Visceral Leishmaniasis
(AVL) used as the positive control. Subsequently, a solution of 3
mM resazurin (New Road Gillingham, UK) diluted in phosphate-buffered
solution (PBS, Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well as a revealing
solution and incubated for 24 h at 25 °C. At the end of this
period, the absorbance (594 nm) was read using a microplate spectrophotometer
(Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices). All assays were performed in
five replicates; the concentration that causes 50% growth inhibition
of promastigote forms (IC50) was calculated using a dose–response
graph (Microsoft Excell 365 vs 2016) with a linear regression for
each test.40

Antibacterial Activity
The tested strains were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Rockville). The following
microorganisms were used in the evaluation of antibacterial activity: Streptococcus mitis (ATCC 49456), Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175), Streptococcus sanguinis (ATCC10556), Agregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC 43717), Actinomyces naeslundii (ATCC 19039), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 25586). The antibacterial
activity of S. phalerata was determined
in triplicate by the verification of the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) using the microdilution broth method in 96-well microplates.41 Each essential oil was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma Aldrich) at a concentration of 8000 μg
mL–1, followed by dilution in tryptic soy broth
(TSB; Merck, Germany) for aerobic microorganisms and in Schaedler
broth (BBL, Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville) supplemented with
hemin (5.0 mg mL–1) and vitamin K1 (1.0 mg mL–1) for anaerobic microorganisms. The tested concentrations
ranged from 400 to 25 μg mL–1. The final DMSO
content was 4% (v v–1); this solution was used as
a negative control. The inoculum was adjusted for each organism to
yield a cell concentration of 5 × 105 colony forming
units (CFU) per milliliter. The microplates with the anaerobic microorganisms
were incubated aerobically, at 37 °C, for 24 h. The anaerobic
microorganisms were incubated for 48–72 h in an anaerobic chamber
(Don Whitley Scientific Bradford, UK), in a 5–10% H2, 10% CO2, 80–85% N2 atmosphere, at
37 °C. After that, resazurin (Acros Organics NV, Belgium) in
an aqueous solution (0.01% w v–1) was added to the
microplates to indicate microorganism viability. Chlorhexidine dihydrochloride
(Sigma Aldrich) was used as a positive control. The negative control
(DMSO) was tested with concentrations ranging from 1 to 10% (v v–1) and did not influence bacterial growth. Sterility
tests were performed for the TSB and Schaedler broths, control culture
(inoculum), positive control, oils, and DMSO.

Cytotoxic Activity
Samples of essential oils of S. phalerata were dissolved in methanol (Merck KgaA,
Germany), diluted in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich), and supplemented until
a solution of 1280 μg mL–1 was achieved. The
cell viability test was performed with ATCC Vero cells (CCL 81; kidney
fibroblasts from the African green monkey). The microplate dilution
method was used to evaluate cytotoxicity. For each test, a solution
containing 1 × 106 cells in supplemented DMEM was
prepared. Then, 100 μL of this solution was added to each well,
and the plate was incubated for 6 h at 37 °C with a humidified
atmosphere and 5% CO2, causing adhesion to the well. Once
attached, the culture medium was removed and solutions of the samples
were added, reaching concentrations of 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32,
16, and 8 μg mL–1 through serial dilutions
from the stock solution. The final concentration of methanol in each
well did not exceed 3%. Growth, negative (100% lysed cells), and solvent
controls (methanol) as well as samples were prepared. The microplates
were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere
and 5% CO2. After that time, a revealing solution of 3
mM resazurin in PBS (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each well, and the
plate was incubated again for 24 h under the same conditions. The
absorbance was read at 594 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer
(Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices). The assays were performed in
five replicates, and the results of absorbance for each concentration
tested were calculated according to the growth control. The cytotoxic
concentration at which 50% of the cells are viable (CC50) was calculated using a dose–response graph with linear regression
for each test. Cytotoxicity to cisplatin (Merck, KgaA, Germany) was
also calculated as a toxicity control for this cell type. To check
the specificity, a relationship between CC50 from the Vero
cell line and IC50 from L. amazonensis was established by the selectivity index (SI) and calculated according
to the equation proposed by Bero et al.42

Molecular Docking
The interaction of the molecules
found in the essential oil from S. phalerata against ergosterol was analyzed through molecular docking using
Autodock v.4.2 under the AutoDockTolls v.1.5.6 workspace.43 The molecules from the essential oil were considered
to be flexible ligands, while ergosterol was defined as the receptor.
However, all torsions were considered once Autodock accepted flexible
receptors. This configuration allowed us to perform molecular docking
with both flexible receptors and ligand molecules. All molecules were
built using the server Automated Topology Builder (ATB) v.3.0, considering
hydrogen atoms.44 In the AutoDockTools
workspace, Gasteiger charges were computed for each molecule. Then,
an Autogrid was applied to determine the searching area for docking
between the molecules using a grid box centered on the ergosterol
structure, with a size of 80–60–50 Å and a spacing
of 0.375 Å. Furthermore, Autodock was performed to generate the
docking solutions using the genetic algorithm (GA) in a standard configuration,
except for the population size and the number of evaluations, with
the parameters set to 200 and 25 × 106, respectively.
Each Autodock run generated 10 solutions, which were analyzed carefully
according to two energy values: (i) binding energy (Eb), or the affinity
of the complex (receptor–ligand) considering the type and number
of interactions, and (ii) intermolecular energy (Ei), or the energy
of the complex after conformational change.

Statistical Analysis
The essential oil yields were
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the statistical
analysis (p ≤ 0.05) of this parameter was
performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Holm–Šidák
test, using SigmaPlot11.0 software.
