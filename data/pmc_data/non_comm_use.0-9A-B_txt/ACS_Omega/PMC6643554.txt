Chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) is a powerful method employed for
high-quality monolayer crystal growth of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides
with much effort invested toward improving the growth process. Here,
we report a novel method for CVD-based growth of monolayer molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) by using thermally evaporated thin films
of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) as the molybdenum (Mo) source
for coevaporation. Uniform evaporation rate of MoO3 thin
films provides uniform Mo vapors which promote highly reproducible
single-crystal growth of MoS2 throughout the substrate.
These high-quality crystals are as large as 95 μm and are characterized
by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
The bottom-gated field-effect transistors fabricated using the as-grown
single crystals show n-type transistor behavior with a good on/off
ratio of 106 under ambient conditions. Our results presented
here address the precursor vapor control during the CVD process and
is a major step forward toward reproducible growth of MoS2 for future semiconductor device applications.

Introduction
Layered two-dimensional
(2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) (MX2: M = Mo, W, X = S, Se, Te) have attracted
a great deal of attention because of their exciting properties emerging
from quantum confinement effects including intrinsic direct band gap
in a single layer, high photoconductivity,1,2 appreciable
charge mobility, and high on/off ratio.3 In particular, 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been
studied extensively over the past few years because of its natural
abundance and making expedited progress in its applications in the
fields of electronics and optoelectronics with photodetectors,4 light-emitting devices,5 solar cells,6 and biosensors.7−9 Most of these studies were carried out in exfoliated samples which
limit their practical application because of low yield, small lateral
size, and uncontrolled layer number. For scalable device fabrication,
large-scale synthesis of MoS2 is highly desirable. Chemical
vapor deposition (CVD)-based synthesis methods including thermal vapor
sulfurization of Mo/MoO3 films,10−12 thermal decomposition
of thiosalts,13 and gas phase reaction
of MoCl5 and H2S gas14 have been employed for large-scale synthesis; however, obtaining
MoS2 samples with controlled layer number and high electrical
and optical quality remain elusive with these methods. The coevaporation
of Mo and S precursor-based CVD has received much attention for the
past few years because of its ability to produce high-quality MoS2 single crystals with excellent electrical and optical properties.15−18 The challenging nature of CVD growth of MoS2 continues
to stimulate intense research effort in this field. If the CVD is
going to be used for large-scale production of MoS2 samples,
it is important to understand how small variations of CVD process
parameters could lead to different results.19,20

In the coevaporation-based CVD technique, the MoO3 powder
and the S powder are commonly used to produce Mo and S vapors which
then react to produce MoS2 crystal, following the two-step
chemical reactions.21    

Because most of the growth-related reactions occur in the vapor
phase, the uniform melting/sublimation of the precursors and maintaining
uniform vapor pressure of the gas-phase precursors are highly desirable
for clean and reproducible growth of MoS2. However, such
a control of uniform vapor pressure turned out to be very challenging,
resulting in a growth of oxide/oxysulfide (MoO2/MoOS2) species along with MoS2.19,22 To our knowledge, the importance of controlling sulfur vapor pressure
is discussed in detail in the literature,23,24 but the discussion of controlling Mo vapor pressure is rare. In
particular, having a uniform vapor pressure of Mo in the reaction
region when sulfur enters can help to maintain proper Mo/S ratio for
the successful and reproducible growth of MoS2. However,
when small amount of MoO3 powder is used and because of
the different particle sizes in the powder, MoO3 cannot
be uniformly distributed in the crucible which might hinder clean
and reproducible growth of MoS2.

Here, we show that
by replacing MoO3 powder with a MoO3 thin film
for Mo precursors, clean and reproducible growth
of monolayer MoS2 can be obtained. MoO3 thin
film of 5–20 nm was thermally evaporated from MoO3 powder which was then used as the Mo precursor for coevaporation.
Uniform evaporation rate of our thin-film precursor facilitates better
control of Mo vapor in the vapor phase, resulting in clean triangular
crystals of monolayer MoS2 on Si/SiO2 substrates
with a high crystal quality and uniformity proved by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Electric characterization of these pristine crystals with bottom-gated
field-effect transistors (FETs) showed an n-type transistor behavior
with a good on/off ratio of 106 under ambient conditions,
verifying the ability of these materials in modern semiconductor electronics.

Results
We synthesized MoS2 single crystals in a home-built
atmospheric pressure CVD system. Figure 1a shows our experimental setup for this study.
MoO3 thin films were deposited on Si/SiO2 substrate
using thermal evaporation and used as the Mo source for coevaporation
synthesis of MoS2 crystals in a single-zone tube furnace.
Substrates were placed faced down toward the thin film source. Sulfur
was placed upstream at a low-temperature zone. The temperature profiles
for MoO3 and S are shown in Figure 1c. Further information on the growth process
can be found in the Materials and Methods section.

setpoint value of 750 °C.

Figure 2 shows
a
representative result for our optimized CVD growth of MoS2. For this, we used 20 nm thin film of MoO3 as a precursor
for Mo vapor. S was placed at the edge of the furnace, 23.5 cm upstream
from the center of the furnace, and the growth temperature was 750
°C. Figure 2a
shows an optical image of the whole Si/SiO2 substrate after
MoS2 growth as well as a bare substrate for comparison.
The darker region of the growth substrate is where the crystals are
grown. This region of the substrate is directly facing toward the
thin-film MoO3 source. To show the growth on this substrate
in detail, we divided this region into nine sections, as shown in Figure 2b, and presented
optical micrographs of each of these region (labeled 1–9) in Figure 2d. From here, we
see that dense crystal grains of self-seeded MoS2 are grown
throughout the growth substrate without any traces of MoO2/MoOS2. This is in clear contrast to what we have observed
when we used a small amount of (∼1 mg) MoO3 powder
as a Mo precursor, where we saw isolated regions of MoS2 growth along with rhomboidal MoO2/MoOS2 on
MoS2 in other regions (Figure S1). Increasing amount of MoO3 powder only increased the
regions of MoO2/MoOS2. Because the difference
between the two scenarios is the uniform sublimation of MoO3 thin film which causes uniform evaporation of Mo in the growth region,
we conclude that uniform evaporation of Mo has an important role in
dense singe-crystal growth of MoS2. We repeated the MoO3 thin film growth over 50 times, and we always obtained clean
MoS2 growth without any oxysulfides. This was not the case
when we used MoO3 powder, where clean and reproducible
MoS2 crystals were hard to achieve. Another important observation
is that all of the single crystals are triangular in shape. Given
the conditions of the growth and the rough edges of these triangular
crystals (Figure 3b)
which are S-zz terminations, we conclude that they are grown at a
sulfur-sufficient environment.24,25 The shape and size
variation of MoS2 crystals has been discussed in the literature
using both experiment and theory.25−27 Depending upon the Mo
vapor concentration with respect to S, MoS2 crystals can
show different shapes (hexagon, truncated triangle, and triangle),
sizes, and density variation as well as formation of MoO2/MoOS2 structures. Wang et al.26 observed variations in the MoS2 crystal shape from triangular
to hexagonal geometries with respect to the distance from MoO3 powdered precursor location. This variation in crystal shape
was attributed to the variation of Mo vapor concentration along the
growth substrate. Wu et al.27 also observed
shape and size variations of MoS2 with respect to MoO3 concentration. These studies suggest that there is a small
window of Mo/S vapor ratio (both in Mo-rich and S-rich regions) during
which the MoS2 crystal can maintain triangular shape although
their size could vary slightly because of a slight variation of Mo/S
vapor ratio. With a relatively larger variation of vapor ratio, both
shape and size can vary. Whereas too much of the Mo vapor variation
could lead to MoS2 in some places and MoO2/MoOS2 in other places. When MoO3 powder was used as
a precursor in our experiment (Figure S1), there appears to be a large variation of Mo/S vapor pressure throughout
the growth region. On the other hand, when MoO3 thin film
was used as precursor for Mo vapor, we observe the same triangular
crystal shape throughout the growth region (no shape variation, neither
any oxysulfide species), suggesting that we are able to maintain a
tight control on Mo vapor concentration in the gas phase by replacing
the powdered precursor by the thin-film precursor.

Figure 2d also shows
a size and density variation of the MoS2 grains in different
regions. A statistical view to the grain size variation is provided
in Figure 2c. We observed
crystal sizes up to 95 μm which is the largest we measured for
this growth, and most crystals favored to grow in 20–40 μm
size that covered around 40% of the growth region. The size variation
and increased nucleation density are consistent with the picture of
maintaining a tight control on the Mo vapor concentration discussed
above. A slight spatial variation of the Mo/S vapor ratio because
of a small variation of either Mo or S or both dictated by the flow,
temperature gradients, and diffusion patterns within the gas can give
rise to different sizes of MoS2 crystals while maintaining
triangular shape, even though Mo evaporation is homogenous. In some
regions, triangular domains are merged to form polycrystalline aggregates28 that can be seen because of the random orientations
of the crystals and higher density.28−31 Collectively, the absence of
any oxysulfide phase along with the ability of maintaining triangular
shape validates our capability to maintain a controlled Mo vapor condition
for the clean growth of MoS2.

In addition to MoS2 grown on the growth substrate, we
have occasionally observed scattered MoS2 growth on source
substrate as well (Figure S7), although
the coverage density is much lower in comparison with the face-down
growth substrate. This is an interesting observation, given the unique
geometry of our growth setup, where Mo and S vapors are trapped between
two parallel plates and the gas flow patterns also differ to the conventional
face-down technique, where the growth substrate sits on top of a crucible
with MoO3 powder precursor. We note that a continuous coverage
of monolayer MoS2 was not obtained using our growth method
neither on the growth substrate nor on the source substrate. The MoS2 single crystal growth reported here using MoO3 thin film as an evaporation source is different than the sulfurization
of Mo thin films previously reported by us and other groups.32,33 In the present work, the reaction between Mo and S occurs in the
vapor phase unlike the sulfurization of Mo thin films, where layer
by layer sulfurization occurs at the thin film surface. In the present
work, S was introduced to the reaction zone when the center of the
furnace was at 650 °C. This is to ensure that all MoO3 thin film was sublimated before S enters the reaction zone. In a
control experiment (no S, all other parameters are identical to the
optimized growth process), we found that 10 nm thin MoO3 thin films were completely gone from the source substrate at a temperature
of 550 °C (in atmospheric pressure). The resulting MoS2 crystal qualities are also different as the grain size in the present
work is tens of microns, whereas in the case of thin-film sulfurization,
the grain size is tens of nanometers. As a result, the MoS2 crystals grown using this method shows a very high crystal quality,
uniformity, and better device properties discussed below, compared
to the polycrystalline films obtained by thin-film sulfurization methods.

Figure 3a shows
an optical micrograph of a single crystal grown with the size of ∼95
μm. These big crystals are mostly composed of monolayer regions
along with some isolated dendritic bilayers34−36 region which
can be clearly seen in the SEM image as well (Figure 3b, spot 2). We only observe this bilayer
formation in large size crystals which could be because of the added
nucleation sites by the defects in the first layer.36 The self-seeded nucleation center is also visible in the
SEM image (Figure 3b, spot 1). The tapping-mode AFM image (Figure 3c) taken at a single-crystal edge was analyzed
to identify the number of layers of the grown crystals. The step height
at this edge was measured to be 0.78 nm which corresponds to the monolayer
MoS2 thickness, and the topography of the crystal shows
a highly uniform layer. Raman single spectra (Figure 3d) was acquired to confirm the chemical composition
of the material grown as well as the layer number. As shown in Figure 3c, Raman spectrum
has two prominent peaks, E2g1 and A1g, which correspond to in-plane
and out-of-plane vibrations of Mo and S atoms with respective wave
numbers of 390.76 and 410.76 cm–1, respectively.
Spacing between these two peaks (Δ) is 19.82 cm–1 consistent with monolayer MoS2.37,38

Figure 4a shows
a PL spectrum from a representative single crystal with two signature
peaks at 1.85 and 1.99 eV which corresponds to A (direct band gap
excitations) and B (excitations resulted from valence band splitting
because of strong spin–orbit coupling39) direct excitronic transitions.37,40,41 The full width at half maximum of the A peak is measured
to be ∼80 meV which is narrower than the exfoliated monolayer
MoS2 samples on Si/SiO2 substrates39,42 showing better optical quality of our samples. The even-color contrast
of the PL intensity mapping of A and B peaks (Figure 4b) confirms the uniform layer thickness of
the crystal.

mapping of A peak for the same crystal. Inset shows the mapping of
B peak.

Scanning TEM (STEM) was employed
to further verify the crystal
quality of the MoS2 crystals. The as-grown MoS2 crystals were transferred to a TEM grid with a carbon mesh using
buffered oxide etchant (BOE; details in Materials
and Methods). Figure 5 shows dark-field STEM (DF-STEM) micrographs for the monolayer
MoS2 grown using the thin-film-based coevaporation. High-resolution
STEM (HRSTEM) image (Figure 5b) clearly shows the high crystalline quality of the monolayers
with a periodic hexagonal atomic arrangement. The lattice constant
is measured as 0.27 nm which agrees well with previously reported
results.29,43 The monolayer can also be identified from
the folding edge of the transferred film (Figure 5c). Evidently in the SEM image, these big
crystals show some multilayer growth at some regions (nucleation center
and adlayers), and accordingly, the STEM data show Moire patterns
caused by the diffraction because of the misalignment of these layers
(Figure S5).

transferred thin film on the copper grid. (b) HRSTEM image of the

We also experimented this growth at higher temperatures. Figure S3 shows the optical micrographs of the
crystals grown at 750, 800, and 850 °C by using 20 nm MoO3 thin films. We observe triangular-shaped crystals at all
growth temperature, suggesting that uniform Mo vapor pressure can
be maintained at elevated temperature. We also found that the coverage
density generally decreases at higher growth temperatures. This could
be linked to the reduced nucleation at higher temperatures. The sticking
coefficient which defines the nucleation ability of the surface significantly
reduces because of the enhanced desorption rate at higher temperatures.44 This phenomenon also explains the multilayer
growth at the nucleation center at higher temperatures. There are
less nucleation sites to facilitate the gas-phase MoS2 to
be adsorbed on to the substrate surface which results in the growth
of multiple MoS2 layers at the same nucleation site. The
multilayer growth at high temperatures is discussed as an effect of
a high precursor supply in the previous reports31,45,46 when the MoO3 powdered precursor
is used which is not applicable for our thin-film-based growth. In
our experiments even at 750 °C, MoO3 thin film precursor
is completely evaporated and reacted to grow MoS2, therefore
more MoO3 supply is not possible. The AFM, Raman, and PL
characterizations for the crystals grown at higher temperature are
shown in Figure S4. The AFM topography
shows a clear stepwise height variation, and each step height measured
is similar to monolayer MoS2 thickness. Raman single spectra
taken near the center of nucleation show the E2g1 and A1g signature
peaks for MoS2 with the spacing of Δ = 23.43 cm–1 which corresponds to a few layers of MoS2.37,46 PL mapping of the crystals grown at 850
°C shows a clear PL intensity drop at these multilayers, and
very thick layers at the center show no PL response. The effect of
MoO3 precursor amount is tested by varying the thickness
of the film from 5 to 20 nm with the same amount of S (Figure S5). All of the crystals grown have a
similar shape, suggesting that the uniform Mo pressure control is
possible even with 5 nm thin film. However, the crystal sizes are
reduced at lower thicknesses of MoO3 because of the low-precursor
supply.

We have also measured electrical transport properties
of MoS2 samples in a bottom-gated FET geometry. FET devices
were
fabricated on the as-grown MoS2 single crystals by using
standard electron beam lithography (EBL; see Materials
and Methods). The nucleation center was excluded at the device
fabrication to minimize the reflection of multiple layers in the transport
measurements. We used nickel for source and drain electrodes. Linear ID–VD confirms
that Ohmic contacts are formed at the two electrodes, and all of the
measurements were performed under ambient conditions for the as-grown
samples. Figure 6 shows
electrical characteristics of a sample device (optical image is shown
in the inset of Figure 6b). The field-effect mobility was extracted based on the slope dID/dVG fitted to
the linear region of the ID–VG using the equation μ = (L/WCGVD)(dID/dVG), where L, W, and CG are the channel length, channel width, and the gate capacitance.
For the sample device shown in the figure, 5 μm channel length
and 6 μm channel width are used in mobility calculations. This
device shows an n-type conduction with an on/off ratio of 106 and peak mobility ∼4.5 cm2/V s, which is comparable
with the mobilities for pristine devices fabricated on CVD-grown monolayers
in previous reports.28

Conclusions
In conclusion, we introduced a new CVD-based
method to synthesize
monolayer MoS2 crystals by using MoO3 thin films
as a precursor for coevaporation. This new method facilitates uniform
vapor pressure of Mo, resulting in a clean single-crystal growth of
MoS2 throughout the substrate, and is highly reproducible.
The as-grown MoS2 crystals show excellent Raman and PL
response corresponding to high-quality single crystals. TEM characterization
further confirms the crystalline quality of the sample. Room-temperature
electrical transport measurements show a mobility of ∼5 cm2/V s with a current on/off ratio of 106. We believe
this new CVD process can be used for the synthesis of other TMDC materials,
and the growth can be extended to a wide range of substrate types.

Materials
and Methods
Growth Process
Si substrates with 250 nm thick oxide
layer were used as growth substrates as well as the substrates to
deposit the MoO3 thin films which were used as a precursor
for coevaporation. The substrate was cleaned via sonication in acetone
for 5 min, followed by sonication in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for 5
min, deionized water rinse, and 10 min mild oxygen plasma treatment.
MoO3 thin films with the thickness of 5–20 nm were
deposited using thermal evaporation of MoO3 powder (99.5%,
Sigma-Aldrich) in a vacuum chamber at low evaporation rates of 0.2–0.5
A/s. The thickness of these thin films was confirmed via AFM topography
(Figure S6). The thin-film-deposited substrates
were cut into 1 cm × 1 cm size and placed in a ceramic boat;
bare target substrates were placed on the same boat facing down with
the separation (Figure 1b) of 3–4 mm toward the source and placed at the center of
the furnace. Although the front end of the boat was left open for
sulfur vapors to enter the reaction zone easily, the rear end was
covered by the substrate to trap the vapor phase precursors near the
substrate, but a small spacing (less than a mm) was left at the end
to ensure that the sulfur vapor pressure does not overstep the balance
between precursors. Ceramic crucible containing 600 mg of S powder
(99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was loaded in to a 1 in. quartz tube placed
at the edge of the tube furnace (Barnstead International F79300 Tube
Furnace) upstream. For different temperature setpoints, the MoO3 and S precursor distance (r) is adjusted
accordingly in such a way that S starts melting below 100° from
the setpoint value. Argon gas (99.995% purity) was used as the carrier
gas. Temperature of the furnace was raised to the growth temperature
of 750–850 °C at the rate of 20 °C/min and held for
10 min (dwell time). After the dwell time, the furnace could cool
down naturally until the temperature dropped to 500 °C at which
point, the furnace hood was opened for rapid cooling. The Ar flow
(200 sccm) was passed initially before heating up the furnace for
10 min to saturate the environment with argon, after which the flow
rate was kept constant at 10 sccm. For the parameters used in this
process, we found that 10 sccm gas flow with 10 min dwell time is
optimum for our growth. When the temperature of the furnace dropped
to 350 °C, it was purged with 200 sccm Ar again to flush off
the excess reactants.

Characterization of the Materials
The surface imaging
and the grain size measurements were carried out by an Olympus BX51M
microscope equipped with a Jenoptic Progres Gryphax camera, and the
SEM images were taken with a Zeiss ULTRA-55 FEG SEM. A tapping-mode
AFM (Veeco instruments, Dimension 3100) topography was used to determine
the height of MoS2 crystals. The samples were scanned at
slow rates in small scan areas at the edge of MoS2 crystal
to achieve more accurate height profiles. Raman and PL spectroscopy
measurements were carried out with confocal Raman microscope (WITec
Alpha 300 RA) at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and with laser
power of 0.293 mW at ambient conditions. For TEM characterizations,
a droplet of BOE was placed on the Si/SiO2 substrate where
MoS2 crystals were grown. After a few minutes, the oxide
layer was etched and the crystals were transferred to the liquid.
The liquid was then picked up by a clean syringe and released on a
TEM grid with a carbon mesh. All TEM/STEM measurements were performed
with a JEOL ARM200F FEG-TEM/STEM with a Cs-corrector.

Device Fabrication
and Transport Measurements
The bottom-gated
FETs for the transport measurements were fabricated using standard
EBL using a Nabity Pattern Generator System connected to a Zeiss ultra
55 SEM for selected single crystals. Poly(methyl methacrylate) was
spin-coated on to the substrate containing MoS2 samples
and baked at 130 °C for 3 min. The source and drain electrodes
were then defined using EBL and developed in a solution of methyl
isobutyl ketone and IPA. A 30 nm thick Ni film was deposited for the
metal contacts using E-beam evaporation. The electron transport measurements
of the final MoS2 devices were carried out in a room temperature
probe station using a Keysight Semiconductor Device Analyzer.
