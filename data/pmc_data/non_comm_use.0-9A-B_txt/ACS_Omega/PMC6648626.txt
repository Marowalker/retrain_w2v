Ligand molecules
capping on clusters largely affect the formation
and stabilization mechanism and the property of clusters. In semiconductor
CdSe clusters, cysteine is used as one of the ligands and allows the
formation of ultrastable (CdSe)34 magic-sized clusters.
Cysteine has sulfhydryl, amine, and carboxylate groups, all of which
have coordination ability to the CdSe surface, and the bonding states
of the three functional groups of ligand–cysteine on the CdSe
core have not been determined. In this work, the capping structure
of ligand–cysteine is examined by performing Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
and multinuclear solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
FT-IR, XPS, and 1H, 13C, and 23Na
magic-angle spinning NMR show that the sulfhydryl group of ligand–cysteine
forms a sulfur–cadmium bond with a cadmium atom at the CdSe
surface, while the carboxylate group does not contribute to the protection
of the CdSe core and binds to a sodium ion contained as a counterion. 15N–{77Se} through-bond J-single quantum filtered NMR experiment reveals that the amine group
of ligand–cysteine has no coordination to selenium atoms. By
considering the N–Cd bond forming ratio (∼43%) revealed
in our previous work, which is confirmed in this work by analyzing 13Cα signal intensity (∼42%), we concluded
that cysteine capping on (CdSe)34 occurs in two ways: one
involves both the sulfur–cadmium and nitrogen–cadmium
bonds, and the other bears only the sulfur–cadmium bond.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Clusters
are composed of up to several hundreds of atoms and have
different structures from their bulk states. Clusters can be synthesized
in a gas phase by, for a few examples, gas aggregation and laser vaporization,
and their structures and stabilities have been studied. It has recently
been shown that clusters can also be prepared in a solvent with organic
molecules working as ligands. Unique structures and electronic states
of solution-phase clusters have been of interest for the realization
of its applications to light-emitting devices, catalysts, and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents.1,2 It has been
reported that the ligands affect the formation and stabilization of
clusters and frequently lead particularly stable clusters called magic-sized
clusters (MSCs). Hence, examination of the structure of a ligand on
a cluster is essential for understanding the stabilization mechanism
of the cluster. For example, in thiolate-capped gold MSCs, thiolate
ligands form −S–Au–S– staple-like units
on the surface of gold MSCs, which protect the cluster core consisting
of Au atoms.3 The ligands can also influence
physical/chemical properties and functions of clusters. In semiconductor
nanoparticles (NPs) and clusters, it has been shown that the ligand–surface
interaction largely affects the optical properties. For example, postsynthetic
secondary ligand modification for CdSe NPs and MSCs affects the quantum
yield of photoluminescence.4−7 Ligand treatment for CdS and CdSe MSCs affects exciton
peak positions, which was ascribed to structural modification of MSCs
induced by additional ligands.8,9 Unlike NPs intrinsically
having size and shape distributions at the atomic level, MSCs have
well-defined structures and thus are suitable for examination of the
correlation between ligand–surface interactions and their properties
and structures.

II–IV semiconductor CdSe MSCs can be
synthesized in a solvent
with narrow size distribution. In 2004, Kasuya et al. reported that
stoichiometric CdSe MSCs, e.g., (CdSe)13 and (CdSe)34, were detected by laser desorption/ionization–mass
spectrometry (LDI-MS) and suggested that they may have a core–cage
structure as predicted by first-principles calculation.10 Since then, CdSe MSCs have been prepared with
various ligands such as thiolates, amines, and carboxylates, and versatile
studies on their structures and properties have been investigated
both experimentally and theoretically.7,11 Cysteine,
which is used as one of the ligands for (CdSe)34 MSCs,
has three functional groups, sulfhydryl, amine, and carboxylate groups,
all of which have the ability to bind to the surface atoms of the
CdSe core. Park et al. synthesized cysteine-capped (CdSe)34 (CdSe-Cys) for the first time and examined the influence of ligands
on the MSC formation using cysteine and its derivatives as ligands.12,13 They showed that the sulfhydryl and the amine groups of cysteine
play an important role for the growth and stabilization of the (CdSe)34 structure. Nevins et al. found that electron transfer from
CdSe-Cys to TiO2 substrate through ligand–cysteine
is more efficient than that from CdSe NPs capped with mercaptocarboxylates
having sulfhydryl and carboxylate groups and suggested that the efficient
transfer for the former is caused by the amine–surface interaction
in CdSe-Cys.14 These studies indicate that
investigation of the protecting structure of ligand–cysteine
in CdSe-Cys is important for both fundamental and applied studies
of (CdSe)34 MSCs. However, the capping structure of ligand–cysteine
has not been determined fully. So far, the studies described above
indicate that both sulfur and nitrogen of the sulfhydryl and amine
groups bind to the cadmium atom at the CdSe surface.13,14 For primary amine-capped CdSe NPs, it has been suggested that the
amine groups coordinate to both the surface cadmium and selenium.15 However, for CdSe-Cys, whether or not the amine
group coordinates to selenium has not yet been clarified. As for the
carboxylate group, Nevins et al. proposed that a fraction of the carboxylate
group as well as the sulfhydryl and amine groups bind to cadmium at
the CdSe surface,14 while Park et al. suggested
no coordination of the carboxylate group to the surface cadmium.13 Furthermore, for semiconductor NPs, it has been
suggested that cysteine capping on CdSe and CdTe NPs occurs with the
sulfur–cadmium bond and the sulfur–cadmium and carboxylate–surface
interactions, respectively.16,17 Hence, involvement
of the carboxylate group in the capping is also one of the questions
addressed in this work. Unfortunately, the single crystals of (CdSe)34 MSCs including CdSe-Cys have not been prepared, and thus,
the overall structure including the ligands has not yet been experimentally
determined by single-crystal XRD analysis.

For characterization
of the surface and interface structures of
MSCs and NPs, whose single crystals are difficult to obtain, Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
are effective methods. FT-IR can analyze vibrational states of functional
groups of a ligand and thus has been used as a powerful method for
characterization of the ligand–surface bond in NPs and MSCs.13,15,18−20 XPS spectrum
shows the binding energies of the ligand and surface atoms, which
also gives insight into the ligand–surface bonding state.4,6,17,21,22 Solid-state NMR can examine local structures,
such as the electronic state around a nuclear spin, internuclear distances,
and the presence of a chemical bond, through nuclear spin interactions
(chemical shift, dipolar, J, and quadrupolar interactions).
For example, through-space dipolar-correlated experiments have unraveled
the ligand–surface interactions and the surface structures
in InP, CdS, and CdSe NPs.23−26 Analysis of the chemical shift interaction has led
to a unique surface structural model of a CdSe MSC.27 Recently, we presented that a through-bond J interaction-based heteronuclear correlation solid-state NMR experiment
allows quantitative analysis for formation ratio of ligand–surface
chemical bonds in semiconductor NPs and clusters.28 Moreover, we showed that combination of a through-bond
dipolar-based heteronuclear correlation experiment with the J-correlated experiment is a powerful tool for detailed
investigation of the surface and interface structures of NPs. In fact,
we revealed the presence of nitrogen–cadmium chemical bonds
and determined the ratio of the bond formation to be ∼43% and
the 15N–113Cd J coupling
constant to be 58.5 Hz for 113Cd- and 15N-enriched
CdSe-Cys. Further, the N–Cd bond length was estimated to be
∼0.24 nm using the 15N–{113Cd}
dipolar correlation experiments. However, the bonding states of the
remaining functional groups in ligand–cysteine are still unknown.

In this work, by performing multinuclear (1H, 13C, 77Se, 15N, 113Cd, and 23Na) solid-state NMR as well as FT-IR and XPS, we examine the protection
mechanism of ligand–cysteine in CdSe-Cys through elucidating
the bonding states of the three functional groups to the CdSe surface.
FT-IR and 1H and 13C NMR suggest that sulfur
of the sulfhydryl group coordinates to the surface cadmium. FT-IR,
XPS O 1s, and 13C and 23Na NMR indicate that
the carboxylate group does not coordinate to the surface cadmium and
binds to a sodium ion that exists in solidified CdSe-Cys as a counterion.
From FT-IR and 1H NMR, we show that, in ligand–cysteine,
ammonium ion structure (−NH3+) in the
zwitterionic form in bulk l-cysteine is deprotonated and
changes to the primary amine structure (−NH2). By
performing 13C NMR, we indicate that the amine groups take
two states, and by performing through-bond 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-single quantum filtered (J-1QF) experiments,
we show that the amine groups have nitrogen–cadmium chemical
bonds and do not form chemical bonding with selenium atoms.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 FT-IR
Figure 1 shows the FT-IR
spectra of bulk l-cysteine taking the zwitterionic form (black
solid line) and CdSe-Cys
(red solid line), together with the chemical formula of the l-cysteine zwitterionic form. In the spectrum of l-cysteine,
the peaks observed at 943 and 2552 cm–1 are assigned
to SH bending and stretching, respectively. The peaks at 806, 823,
and 1391 cm–1 are ascribed to COO– bending, wagging, and symmetric stretching, respectively, and the
shoulder peak at 1610 cm–1 is ascribed to COO– asymmetric stretching. The peak at 1064 cm–1 is attributed to NH3+ rocking, the peaks at
1525, 1541, and 1577 cm–1 are attributed to NH3+ bending, and the peaks at 2638, 2960, and 3165
cm–1 are attributed to NH3+ stretching. All assignment for the peaks in the spectrum of l-cysteine and referenced articles are shown in Table S1, Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (a) FT-IR spectra of
bulk l-cysteine (black solid line)
and CdSe-Cys (red solid line). The blue, green, and purple dashed
lines indicate the positions of SH, NH3+, and
COO– peaks in the spectrum of l-cysteine,
respectively. (b) Zwitterionic structure of l-cysteine.

In the spectrum of CdSe-Cys, no
SH peaks were observed at 943 and
2552 cm–1, which indicates that the sulfhydryl group
of ligand–cysteine is deprotonated. The peaks at 801 and 1397
cm–1 are ascribed to COO– bending
and symmetric stretching, respectively, while the COO– wagging and asymmetric stretching peaks were not observed at around
823 and 1610 cm–1. The COO– wagging
and asymmetric stretching peaks may move from the 823 and 1610 cm–1 region and hide under other peaks. The shift of the
COO– peaks in CdSe-Cys may be ascribed to an interaction
with a metal element. In fact, a carboxylate group binding to the
metal ion frequently forms the O=C—O– structure with a strong C=O stretching peak at the region
of ∼1640–1740 cm–1.29,30 In the spectrum of CdSe-Cys, however, no such peak was observed.
Thus, we tentatively postulate that the carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine
has the (O–C–O)− structure, where
an electron is delocalized equally over the two oxygen atoms. In the
CdSe-Cys spectrum, the NH3+ rocking (1064 cm–1) and stretching peaks (2638, 2960, and 3165 cm–1) appeared in l-cysteine were not observed,
and two broad peaks were found at 1565 and ∼3250 cm–1. We attribute the former broad peaks to NH2 bending,
which appears at 1547–1583 and 1541–1639 cm–1 for amines binding to a metal ion or the surface of metal chalcogenide
NPs.15,29 The latter broad peak can also be assigned
to the stretching of NH2, which was reported15,29 to appear at 3300 cm–1 for NH2/metal
ion or metal chalcogenide NPs. The chemical state of the amine group
of CdSe-Cys being primary amine (−NH2) and not the
ammonium ion form (−NH3+) is consistent
with our previous NMR study for the N–Cd chemical bond in CdSe-Cys.28 The assignments of the COO– and NH2 peaks of CdSe-Cys are shown in Table S2, Supporting Information.

2.2 XPS
Figure 2 shows the
XPS O 1s spectra of l-cysteine (black solid line), CdSe-Cys
(red solid line), and cadmium
acetate dihydrate [Cd(OAc)2·2H2O] (blue
solid line). A background signal derived from carbon tape is also
shown (gray). The O 1s peaks of the three samples were observed at
531.1, 532.3, and 533.4 eV. Cd(OAc)2·2H2O has two kinds of oxygen atoms (the carboxylate group and the water
molecule); hence, the peak of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O would be composed of two O 1s peaks overlapping each other. The
peak position of CdSe-Cys is different from those of l-cysteine
and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O, which indicates that
the electronic state of the carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine
is different from either that of l-cysteine having no coordination
or that of Cd(OAc)2·2H2O binding to a cadmium
ion. As the carboxylate structure in Cd(OAc)2·2H2O is the (O–C–O)− form, these
XPS results may indicate that the carboxylate group in CdSe-Cys does
not bind to cadmium. This will be discussed afterward with the IR
and NMR results.

CdSe-Cys
(red solid line), Cd(OAc)2·2H2O (blue solid
line), and carbon tape (gray solid line). The spectral intensities
of l-cysteine, CdSe-Cys, and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O are normalized.

2.3 1H MAS NMR
To gain further
insight into the bonding state of ligand–cysteine, we conducted
solid-state NMR. Figure 3 shows the 1H magic-angle spinning (MAS) spectra of l-cysteine and CdSe-Cys. The peaks at 3.5 and 9.0 ppm in the
spectrum of l-cysteine are assigned to CH and NH3+, respectively. As the reported chemical shift for SH
is 1.9 ppm,31 we attributed the peak at
2.0 ppm to SH and CH2. In the spectrum of CdSe-Cys, a major
peak and minor peaks were observed at 4.8 and 0–1.8 ppm, respectively.

Figure 3 1H MAS NMR spectra of (a) l-cysteine and (b)
CdSe-Cys. The spectra of l-cysteine and CdSe-Cys were obtained
at spinning speeds of 40 and 20 kHz, respectively.

The NH3+ peak was not observed
at 9.0 ppm
in the spectrum of CdSe-Cys. In our synthesis condition, the pH of
CdSe-Cys(aq) is ∼13, which is higher than the pKa of NH3+ of l-cysteine
(10.28).32 Thus, the amine group of ligand–cysteine
forms not NH3+ but NH2, whose proton
peak is expected to appear at around 5 ppm. Note that formation of
NH2 is consistent with the results of the IR study. We
would like to note that the CH2 and SH peaks were not observed
at 2 ppm. The disappearance of the SH peak is also consistent with
the results of the IR measurement for CdSe-Cys, that is, the sulfhydryl
groups of ligand–cysteine are deprotonated. For the CH2 peak in the 1H spectrum of CdSe-Cys, it appears
that the CH2 peak merge into the ∼4.8 ppm peak composed
of CH and NH2. To confirm, we measured the 1H MAS spectrum of CdSe-Cys having a deuterated amine group in ligand–cysteine
and observed a narrow major peak at 4.8 ppm and minor peaks at around
1–2 ppm (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Because CdSe-Cys is an intrinsic semiconductor, this high-frequency
shift from 2.0 to 4.8 ppm is not ascribed to paramagnetic electrons.
Further, the shift difference (∼2.8 ppm) is too large to be
attributed to the pH ≈ 13 condition in the preparation of CdSe-Cys;
the shift difference of the CH2 proton signal of the cysteine
residue in a tripeptide between the acid and the conjugate base forms
is only 0.09 ppm.33 Hence, we consider
that structural deformation and change in electron delocalization
of cysteine upon capping onto the CdSe surface cause the shift of
the 1H signal. To conclude, the major peak at 4.8 ppm can
be ascribed to the sum of the CH2, CH, and NH2 signals. As for the minor peaks at ∼0–2 ppm, similar
peaks were observed in the 1H MAS spectrum of cysteine-capped
gold NPs and assigned to SH and CH2 peaks of mobile cysteine
molecules existing around ligand–cysteine of gold NPs.31 We also follow this and assigned the minor peaks
to free mobile cysteine present in the solidified CdSe-Cys as an impurity.

2.4 13C CP/MAS NMR
1H
→ 13C cross-polarization (CP)/MAS NMR spectra
of l-cysteine and CdSe-Cys are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively. The Cβ, Cα, and COO– peaks
of l-cysteine were observed at 27.5, 55.4, and 172.8 ppm,
respectively. In the spectrum of CdSe-Cys, all three peaks broaden,
and the Cβ and COO– peaks shift
to the higher frequency (32.1 and 180.2 ppm, respectively). The Cα peak of CdSe-Cys bears two peaks at 54.4 and 59.4 ppm
with some small shoulder peaks. Additionally, a minor peak was observed
at 165.1 ppm.

Figure 4 13C CP/MAS spectra of (a) l-cysteine
and (b)
CdSe-Cys. The spectra were acquired with a spinning speed of 20 kHz
and contact time of 1 ms.

Firstly, we assign the latter minor peak. It is notable that 13C signals derived from carbonates and carbamates are observed
at ∼162–170 ppm.34−37 This suggests that carbonate or carbamate may be
mixed in the CdSe-Cys solid. To examine this, we solidified CdSe-Cys
from the synthesis solution with N2 bubbling (more detailed
procedures are explained in the Supporting Information). In the 13C CP/MAS spectrum for this CdSe-Cys sample,
no peak was observed at 165.1 ppm (see Figure S3, Supporting Information), which indicates that the 13C minor peak at 165.1 ppm is not derived from the functional
groups of ligand–cysteine but carbonate/carbamate from cysteine
reacted with CO2 during the solidification process.

The broadening of other 13C peaks in CdSe-Cys is attributed
to chemical shift distribution of the 13C peaks due to
disorder of the orientation of ligand–cysteine. The frequency
shifts of the Cβ and COO– peaks
imply that the sulfhydryl binding to the Cβ and carboxylate
groups of ligand–cysteine have states different from those
of free l-cysteine; in other words, the sulfhydryl and carboxylate
groups may interact with the CdSe core. The two Cα peaks can be attributed to the two kinds of the amine groups, namely,
one binding to Cd and the other is not, as shown by 15N–{113Cd} J-1QF experiment in our previous work.28 The small shoulder peaks indicate the existence
of Cα with slightly different coordination geometry.
The signal intensity ratio for the two Cα peaks was
estimated to be the sharper one: the broader one is 42:58 by line-shape
analysis, which is consistent with the previous result (43:57).28 The sharper Cα signal for ligand–cysteine
with the Cd–N bond is understandable as the Cd–N bond
would reduce structural distribution.

2.5 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF NMR
To confirm the presence
of the nitrogen–cadmium bond in CdSe-Cys
newly synthesized in this work and to examine whether the nitrogen–selenium
bond exists or not, 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF NMR experiments
were performed. In the 1H → 15N CP/MAS
NMR spectrum of CdSe-Cys (Figure 5a), two peaks (hereafter peak A and peak B), were observed
at ∼35 and ∼97 ppm, respectively. The 15N
spectrum of the 15N–{113Cd} J-1QF experiment conducted with the echo refocusing time τ of
6.05 ms (Figure 5b)
displays only peak A and that of the 15N–{77Se} experiment with τ of 5 ms (Figure 5c) bears no peak. In the 15N–{77Se} experiment with τ of 10 ms, no signal was also
observed (data not shown). The former result indicates that the amine
group of peak A forms the nitrogen–cadmium chemical bond with
the surface cadmium of the CdSe core, while the amine group of peak
B forms no nitrogen–cadmium bond, which is consistent with
our previous report.28 The latter 15N–{77Se} experiment shows that no amine
group coordinates to the surface selenium.

Figure 5 (a) 15N CP/MAS,
(b) 15N–{113Cd} J-1QF,
and (c) 15N–{77Se} J-1QF spectra for CdSe-Cys. Two peaks at ∼35
and ∼97 ppm in the CP/MAS spectrum are labeled as peak A and
peak B, respectively. The 15N–{113Cd}
and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF
spectra were obtained with τ = 6.05 and 5 ms, respectively.

It was shown that the amine group
of peak B has no chemical bond
to either cadmium or selenium. Following the assignment of the 13C minor peak to carbonate or carbamate, we also assign peak
B to the amine group binding to a carbonate ion, i.e., carbamate.
In fact, the chemical shift value of peak B is contained in the chemical
shift range of 15N carbamate signals.38 It is true that the N2 gas bubbling for an 15N-enriched sample would give conclusive evidence, but we
have not done it as the assignment of peak B is not crucial in this
work.

2.6 Capping Structure of Ligand–Cysteine
As a sulfhydryl group is known to have binding ability to metal
elements, especially cadmium,39−42 the observation of no SH peaks in the 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra led us to envisage that the sulfur of the
sulfhydryl group of ligand–cysteine binds to the surface atoms
of the CdSe core. It has been reported that by examining the 13C NMR spectra for cadmium–cysteine complexes and cysteine-capped
CdSe and CdTe NPs, a cadmium–cysteine bond brings a high-frequency
shift to the Cβ peak,16,17,40 which is consistent with the observed high-frequency
shift of the Cβ peak of CdSe-Cys. We therefore conclude
that, in CdSe-Cys, the sulfur in the sulfhydryl group of ligand–cysteine
forms the sulfur–cadmium bond with the surface cadmium of the
CdSe core.

In the following, we examine binding states of the
carboxylate group in CdSe-Cys. The FT-IR results indicate that the
carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine takes the (O–C–O)− form. Nevins et al. observed a similar peak shift
of the carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine in the FT-IR spectrum
of CdSe-Cys and suggested that a fraction of the carboxylate group
as well as the sulfhydryl and amine groups coordinate to the CdSe
surface.14 The observed peak shifts in
this work may therefore be attributed to coordination of the carboxylate
group to the CdSe surface. However, the XPS O 1s spectra indicate
that the electronic state of the carboxylate group in CdSe-Cys is
different from that of the carboxylate group binding to a cadmium
ion. The 13C chemical shift of the carboxylate carbon (180.2
ppm) is also inconsistent with that of the COO– peak
of cysteine-capped CdSe NPs (163.0 ppm),16 which was potentially ascribed to the carboxylate group coordinated
to the CdSe surface.

As for the counter cation of the carboxylate
group, Na+ can be a possible candidate since a large amount
of sodium ions
exist in the synthesis solution of CdSe-Cys. To examine this possibility,
the 23Na MAS NMR was conducted for CdSe-Cys. As a result,
a strong 23Na peak appeared (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which is ascribed to the sodium
ion captured in the solidified CdSe-Cys. It is thus natural to consider
that the carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine in the solidified
CdSe-Cys binds to the sodium ion. To confirm the state of the carboxylate
group, we conducted 1H → 13C CP/MAS NMR
experiments for CdSe-Cys synthesized with RbOH and CsOH instead of
NaOH, all of which are alkali hydroxides. The synthesis and 13C spectra for CdSe-Cys produced with RbOH and CsOH are shown in the Supporting Information. Table 1 collated the chemical shift values obtained
by spectral fitting of the 13C spectra of CdSe-Cys prepared
with NaOH, RbOH, and CsOH to a Voigt function. The comparison of the
peak positions shows that the COO– chemical shift
value decreases upon increasing the ionic radius of alkali ions (Na+ < Rb+ < Cs+), while the Cα and Cβ peaks show no correlation to
the ionic radius, which indicates that the electronic state of only
the carboxylate group is affected by the alkali ion species.

Table 1 13C Chemical Shift Values
(ppm) of CdSe-Cys Prepared with NaOH, RbOH, and CsOH
peaks	NaOH	RbOH	CsOH	
Cβ	32.14 ± 0.01	32.41 ± 0.01	32.18 ± 0.03

COO–	180.17 ± 0.02	179.49 ± 0.02	179.18 ± 0.05	
The (O–C–O)−–Na+ coordination would also explain the observed COO– peak shifts in the FT-IR spectrum. In the IR spectrum of CdSe-Cys,
the broad peak at 1565 cm–1 assigned to NH2 bending may include the COO– asymmetric stretching
peak of COO––Na+. The difference
between the COO– asymmetric and symmetric stretching
peaks is ∼168 cm–1, which suggests that the
carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine forms ionic bidentate
coordination to the sodium ion.43 First-principles
calculation on cysteine-coordinated (CdSe)N nanoclusters (N = 1–10, 13, 16, and 19)
shows that the sulfur and oxygen atoms of cysteine in alkaline solution
cannot simultaneously coordinate to a cadmium atom at the surface
of CdSe nanoclusters because of the structural rigidity of cysteine.44 Hence, in cysteine-capped (CdSe)34, it is also unlikely for the carboxylate group to form bridging
coordination to sodium and cadmium. To conclude, the carboxylate group
of ligand–cysteine binds to the counter Na+ ions
in the solid-state CdSe-Cys and not to the CdSe core surface.

As for the amine group, the 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF experiments revealed that the nitrogen of the amine group of
ligand–cysteine has a chemical bond to the surface cadmium
but not to selenium. In our previous work, the ratio of the amine
group forming the nitrogen–cadmium bond in CdSe-Cys was estimated
to be ∼43% through the quantitative 15N–{113Cd} J-1QF analysis.28 The rest (∼57%) of the amine group has no chemical
bond to the surface and thus does not contribute to the stabilization
of the CdSe core. The ratio is consistent with the N–Cd bond
forming ratio of the amines obtained from the 13C peak
area ratio of the two Cα peaks (42:58).

Let
us summarize the results of the bonding states of the three
functional groups of the ligated cysteine. The sulfhydryl group and
∼43% of the amine groups form the sulfur–cadmium and
nitrogen–cadmium chemical bonds to the CdSe core surface, while
the carboxylate group binds to the counter Na+ ion in the
solid-state CdSe-Cys. This leads to the two types of ligand–cysteine
complex; ∼43% of the complex has the sulfur–cadmium
and nitrogen–cadmium bonds and the rest (∼57%) has only
the sulfur–cadmium bond to stabilize the (CdSe)34 structure. The stabilization mechanism by both sulfur and nitrogen
of ligand–cysteine binding to the CdSe core surface has also
been suggested by comparing the MSC formation ability between l-cysteine and its derivatives as ligands.13 In this work, we could show the existence of the two kinds
of the capping structure of ligand–cysteine in CdSe-Cys. The
difference of the ratio of the two ligand–surface bonds, i.e.,
the sulfur–cadmium (100%) and nitrogen–cadmium (∼43%),
indicates that the sulfur–cadmium bond works dominantly in
the stabilization of (CdSe)34. This is consistent with
the result of our previous work, that is, the nitrogen–cadmium
chemical bond in CdSe-Cys is not strong as evidenced by the small 15N–113Cd J coupling constant
(58.5 Hz) and the corresponding long N–Cd bond length (∼2.4
Å).28 A theoretical study has shown
that cysteine capping on CdSe nanoclusters in alkaline solution forms
a strong sulfur–cadmium bond and a weak nitrogen–cadmium
bond,44 which is in good agreement with
our experimental results. It has been reported that CdSe MSCs can
be synthesized with thiolate ligands alone.7,45 However,
as compared to the “thiolate alone” CdSe MSCs, the apparent
linewidth of the absorption peak in UV-vis spectra of our CdSe-Cys
is sharper. This can also be explained by the additional coordination
of a part of the nitrogen to the surface cadmium leading a more stable
CdSe core with narrower structural distribution. The two types of
ligand–cysteine protecting (CdSe)34 can therefore
be essential to understand the stability of CdSe-Cys.

3 Conclusions
We synthesized 113Cd, 77Se, and 15N-enriched CdSe-Cys and examined the capping
structure of ligand–cysteine
in CdSe-Cys by performing FT-IR, XPS, and multinuclear solid-state
NMR spectroscopy. FT-IR and 1H MAS NMR showed that the
sulfhydryl group of ligand–cysteine was deprotonated, and 13C CP/MAS NMR indicated that the sulfhydryl formed the sulfur–cadmium
bond with the cadmium atoms at the CdSe surface. XPS O 1s spectra
suggested that the electronic state of the carboxylate group of ligand–cysteine
is different from that of the carboxylate coordinating to a cadmium
ion. By examining 13C CP/MAS NMR, we showed that the chemical
shift values of the carboxylate group varied for different counterions
(Na+, Rb+, and Cs+). This led us
to conclude that the carboxylate group has an ionic bond with the
alkali metal ions in the solid-state CdSe-Cys and did not contribute
to the protection of the CdSe core. FT-IR and 1H NMR showed
that the amine group of ligand–cysteine takes not the ammonium
ion form (−NH3+) but the primary amine
structure (−NH2), and 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF NMR showed that the amines formed the nitrogen–cadmium
bond with the surface cadmium, while no amine group coordinated to
the surface selenium. By considering the N–Cd bond formation
ratio (∼43%) estimated in our previous work, we concluded that,
in CdSe-Cys, all of the sulfhydryl group and ∼43% of the amine
group of ligand–cysteine form sulfur–cadmium and nitrogen–cadmium
chemical bonds, respectively, which stabilizes the structure of (CdSe)34. We would like to point out that the ratio of the two structures
obtained by the 15N–{113Cd} J-1QF NMR is consistent with the 13C peak area intensities
of the two Cα signals (42:58). The strong stabilization
structure does show narrower structural distribution, leading to the
sharp UV–vis absorption peak.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Cadmium (foil; 113Cd, 93.35%) and selenium (powder; 77Se, 99.20%) were purchased
from ISOFLEX USA. l-cysteine (15N, 98%) was obtained
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) (97%), sodium hydrate (NaOH) (93%), nitric acid (HNO3) (60–61%), cadmium acetate dihydrate [Cd(OAc)2·2H2O] (98%), and acetone (99.5%) were purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Corporation. All chemical reagents were used
as received.

4.2 Synthesis and Solidification
of Isotope-Enriched
CdSe-Cys
CdSe-Cys was synthesized in an aqueous solution
and solidified by using our previous method with some modifications.28 The 77Se precursor, Na2SeSO3(aq), was prepared by stirring (950 rpm) 25 mg of 77Se powder, 118 mg of Na2SO3, and 12.5
mL of distilled H2O in a brown glass vial at ∼90
°C overnight. Cadmium hydroxide (Cd(OH)2) was produced
by adding 5 M NaOH to a solution of 55.6 mg of 113Cd metal
in HNO3 and collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for
5 min. The 113Cd precursor, aqueous Cd–cysteine
complex, was obtained by mixing Cd(OH)2, 2.00 mL of 1 M l-[15N] cysteine, 8.9 mL of 1 M NaOH, and 10.9 mL
of distilled H2O. The 113Cd precursor was divided
into two centrifuge tubes at equal amounts, and CdSe-Cys solution
was obtained by adding 4.83 mL of the 77Se precursor to
each centrifuge tube. The mixture was kept at room temperature for
7 d, and the UV–vis absorption spectrum of CdSe-Cys was measured
(see Figure S1, Supporting Information).
The observed first absorption peak at 422 nm with additional peaks
at 389 and 360 nm indicates that CdSe-Cys is successfully synthesized.6,10,46 Further, the observed narrow
width of the first absorption peak (∼15 nm) suggests that the
size distribution is not large. Acetone (∼7.5 mL) was slowly
added for 15 min to each of the two mixture solutions by using a syringe
under air to precipitate CdSe-Cys. A yellow CdSe-Cys solid was collected
by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and finally obtained after
slow vacuum drying (∼1.5 d) in a desiccator.

4.3 FT-IR Spectroscopy
FT-IR spectra
for l-cysteine and CdSe-Cys were measured by using a Nicolet
iS5 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with an iD5 ATR accessory.

4.4 XPS
XPS O 1s spectra of l-cysteine,
CdSe-Cys, and Cd(OAc)2·2H2O
were recorded on an ESCA-3400 (Shimadzu Corp.) with a Mg anode and
an X-ray power of 200 W (acceleration voltage: 10 kV; emission current:
20 mA). In the measurement, the samples were attached on sample holders
by using carbon tape. Binding energies were referenced to the C 1s
main peak of carbon tape at 284.8 eV.

4.5 Solid-State
NMR Spectroscopy
Solid-state
NMR experiments for l-cysteine and isotope-enriched CdSe-Cys
were conducted in a 9.4 T magnet (1H, 400.23 MHz; 13C, 100.65 MHz; 113Cd, 88.81 MHz; 77Se, 76.29 MHz; and 15N, 40.56 MHz) on an OPENCORE spectrometer47 with a homemade MAS probe for 1H
using a 1.6 mm rotor or a T3 HXY MAS probe (3.2 mm rotor, Chemagnetics).
For 1H–113Cd–15N and 1H–77Se–15N tuning, homemade
plug-in units were made for the T3 HXY MAS probe. 1H MAS
spectra for l-cysteine and CdSe-Cys were measured at spinning
speeds of 40 and 20 kHz with 90° pulse lengths of 2.3 and 2.5
μs, recycling delays of 20 and 1 s, corresponding
to five-fold of each 1H spin-lattice relaxation time,
and 16 and 32 scans, respectively. For background suppression, the
DEPTH sequence48 was used for the acquisition
of the 1H spectra. 1H → 13C and 1H → 15N CP/MAS spectra were acquired
at a spinning speed of 20 kHz under 1H heteronuclear TPPM
decoupling49 with a radio-frequency (rf)
pulse strength of 90 kHz. The contact time for CP/MAS was set to 1
ms (13C) and 0.4 ms (15N) with rf strengths
of 70 kHz for 1H and 50 kHz ramped in the range of ±7
kHz for 13C and 15N. In the 13C experiments
for l-cysteine and CdSe-Cys, the recycling delays of 4 and
1 s and the accumulation numbers of 3600 and 100000 scans were used,
respectively. In the 15N measurement for CdSe-Cys, the
recycling delay of 1 s and 1500 scans were used.

15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF experiments28 were done using the pulse sequence shown in Figure 6 under a spinning speed of 20 kHz and 1H TPPM decoupling with an rf strength of 90 kHz. In the 15N–{113Cd} J-1QF experiment,
the 15N 180° pulse length and 113Cd 90°
pulse length were 9.4 and 2.8 μs, respectively. In the 15N–{77Se} J-1QF experiment,
the 15N 180° pulse length and 77Se 90°
pulse length were 10.1 and 3.6 μs, respectively. The 1H → 15N ramped CP contact time was 0.4 ms with
rf strengths of 70 and 50 ± 7 kHz for 1H and 15N, respectively. In the 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF experiments, the recycling delay of 1 s and the accumulation
number of 100,000 and 10,000 scans were used, respectively.

Figure 6 Pulse sequence
for 15N–{113Cd} and 15N–{77Se} J-1QF experiments.
In these experiments, only the 15N signal having a through-bond J interaction with 113Cd or 77Se can
be acquired. Phase cycling scheme for the J-1QF:
φ1 = y, −y; φ2 = x, x, x, x, y, y, y, y, −x, −x, −x, −x, −y, −y, −y, −y; φ31 = x; φ32 = x, x, −x, −x; φrec = x, −x, −x, x, −x, x, x, −x.

The chemical shifts of 1H, 13C, and 15N were referenced to TMS
at 0 ppm, CH2 of adamantane
at 37.85 ppm relative to TMS, and NH4Cl at 39.3 ppm to
NH3 liquid,50 respectively.
