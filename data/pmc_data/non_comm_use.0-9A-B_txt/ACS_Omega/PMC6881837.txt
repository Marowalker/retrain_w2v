Adsorption
isotherms of benzene, cyclohexane, and hexane were determined
from the gas phase on microporous activated carbons with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
areas between 816 and 996 m2 g–1. The
Dubinin–Radushkevich equation was used to calculate the parameters
of characteristic energy Eo and micropore
volume Wo. Also, immersion enthalpies
of activated carbons in solvents were obtained (benzene: −95.0
to −145.1 J g–1; cyclohexane: −21.2
to −91.7 J g–1; and hexane: −16.4
to −66.1 J g–1), and they were used to calculate
the product EoWo with the Stoeckli and Kraehenbuehl equations. Subsequently, values
of EoWo from
the two techniques (between 512 and 2223 J cm3 mol–1 g–1 for the adsorption isotherms;
between 1204 and 12008 J cm3 mol–1 g–1 for immersion enthalpies) were correlated with some
characteristics of the adsorbate such as molecular size, the molar
volume, and the dielectric constant. It was found that modifying the
activated carbon affected the adsorption process, being favored by
temperature changes and restricted by oxidation processes. The adsorbate,
which showed the highest values for EoWo, was benzene, because it had a smaller
molecular size and a higher dielectric constant.

Introduction
Activated carbon is widely used in adsorption
processes1,2 and its behavior is closely linked to its
porous structure. One
of the techniques used for its characterization is the physical adsorption
of gases and vapors.3 As activated carbons
are mostly microporous, the theory of volume filling of micropores
(TVFM)4 adequately described the adsorption
on this kind of solid. This theory indicated that if the adsorbate
was assumed as a liquid,
the fundamental property that determined the adsorption capacity of
a microporous solid was the micropore volume, instead of the specific
surface.5,6 This theory led to the Dubinin–Radushkevich
(DR) model, which allowed one to obtain parameters such as the characteristic
energy (Eo) and micropore volume (Wo) based on adsorption isotherms.

Another
technique to evaluate solid–adsorbate interactions
is immersion calorimetry. Immersion enthalpy is a function of the
adsorbate and microporous system.7 Stoeckli
and Kraehenbuehl proposed a mathematical relationship where proportionality
between immersion enthalpy and the characteristic energy was shown,
and thus a correlation with the microporous system.6

This article is interesting since it shows the interaction
of three
C6 hydrocarbons with activated carbon, where the adsorbates
have different natures: benzene (an aromatic compound), cyclohexane
(a closed-chain aliphatic compound), and hexane (an open-chain aliphatic
compound). The activated carbons differ in their physicochemical characteristics,
mainly in the superficial groups, since these activated carbons have
different development of acidity and basicity and they are used to
evaluate their behavior as adsorbents of nonpolar substances.

The evaluation of adsorption of these three hydrocarbons had been
carried out in materials such as zeolites8 and ordered mesoporous carbons,9 and
some studies were found in activated carbons10−13 where the adsorbed amount was
analyzed. However, little was discussed about energy parameters such
as characteristic energy of adsorption (Eo) (there was no comparative process and hydrocarbons were evaluated
separately14−18); the correlation between this Eo and
the microporous system (Wo) was barely
addressed and no correlations were found between these two (EoWo) and the enthalpy
of immersion (ΔHim). These correlations
would be interesting because immersion enthalpy is a thermodynamic
parameter that allows us to evaluate the interaction between the adsorbent
and the adsorbate, since the works that had been carried out on immersion
enthalpies analyzed these compounds separately or maximum two of them
(benzene,19−21 cyclohexane,22,23 hexane22,24); also, ΔHim is determined by
means of immersion calorimetry that is not a conventional technique
either. In turn, this paper establishes a relationship between the
adsorption and immersion process, and the enthalpy values are used
to calculate the EoWo parameter by the mathematical equation of Stoeckli and Kraehenbuehl,
in addition to EoWo, previously calculated by the adsorption isotherms through
the DR model. Therefore, the aforementioned is a novelty that this
manuscript could contribute to this field of research.

Results and Discussion
In this manuscript, the relationship
between the microporous structure
of a solid (Wo), the energy generated
by the interaction of an adsorbent when placed in contact with a given
adsorbate (−ΔHim), and the
adsorption energy of the process (Eo)
will be established. For this, the mathematical relationship proposed
by Dubinin–Radushkevich and Stoeckli and Kraehenbuehl was used
to calculate the EoWo product by the determination of gas-phase adsorption isotherms
and by the immersion enthalpies of activated carbons (with changes
in their chemical and textural properties) in three hydrocarbons (benzene,
cyclohexane, and hexane). Finally, a correlation between the parameters
obtained by the two techniques was established.

Adsorption Isotherms and Their Relationship
with Physicochemical Characteristics of Activated Carbons
Characterization
of the Porous Solids
Table 1 shows the proximate analysis
of samples. As the moisture content is higher in the oxidized samples,
the active sites that can interact with the water molecules increases,25 increasing the ability of these porous solids
to retain humidity from air. The percentage of volatile matter also
increased in samples modified with HNO3 because groups
on the surface of the solid were generated, as well as the humic substances
were formed.26 At the same time the fixed
carbon of the solids decreased as the volatile material increased;
this fixed carbon also increased with the heat treatment temperature
since the number of surface groups decreased. Finally, the ash content
had similar values; however, the samples CAON, CAON723, and CAON1023
showed a slight detriment. This was because the chemical modification
allowed the removal of part of the inorganic matter present in the
starting sample.

Table 2 shows physicochemical
characteristics of the samples: the apparent surface area and the
total pore volume (Wt) obtained by the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model, the micropore volume
(Wo) calculated by the DR equation as
well as the micropore contribution, the average pore size determined
from the N2 adsorption isotherms by the quenched solid
density functional theory (QSDFT) model, the total surface acidity
and basicity obtained by Boehm titrations, and the hydrophobic factor
(Hf) derived from the relationship between
the immersion enthalpies, benzene/water.

According to Table 2, oxidation affected both the porosity and
surface chemistry of the
original sample. In terms of textural parameters, the apparent surface
area, the micropore volume, and the average pore size decreased. With
respect to the chemical characteristics, it was observed that the
acidic group content practically doubled, and the basicity and hydrophobic
character of the activated carbon sample decreased. This occurred
because, according to what has been reported, nitric acid increased
the amount of superficial oxygenated groups. This favored electrostatic
interactions and therefore increased the hydrophilicity of the sample.
Furthermore, nitric acid oxidation could cause partial porosity destruction
due to erosion of the micropore walls. This decreased the pore volume
and it probably generated restrictions on the edges of the graphene
layers due to the fixation of these oxygenated groups in the active
sites located at the entrance of the micropores. This reduced the
amount of adsorbate that was retained in the pores.27−29

Then,
despite having a smaller area, the oxidized sample (CAON)
could generate favorable adsorption processes with polar molecules,
thanks to the characteristics of its surface chemistry. Due to the
fact that the aim of this research was to adsorb hydrocarbons, this
sample had the least adsorption capacity and lower values for the
adsorbent–adsorbate interaction, which will be demonstrated
later.

The other type of modification that was made to the starting
sample
was thermal treatment at different temperatures. Two of the modified
samples were oxidized prior to heating, and the other sample was subjected
to thermal modification directly without treatment with nitric acid.
It showed that the surface area increased proportionally with the
temperature of the thermal treatment.

Table 2 shows that
the micropore volume and the average pore size have similar values
for all of the samples that were subjected to thermal modifications.
This was probably because two processes occurred when oxidation and
subsequent thermal treatment were carried out. In the oxidation process,
porosity was reduced by the inclusion of surface groups. Later, when
the thermal treatment was carried out, some of these surface groups
were removed, causing the porosity to increase again. Because the
two treatments generated opposite effects, the treated samples had
values similar to those obtained for the starting sample.27−31

The corroboration of the addition and subsequent elimination
of
some surface groups by oxidation followed by heat treatment was shown
in the values of total acidity and basicity. CAG had a total acidity
of 195.25 μmol g–1, which subsequently increased
to 392.89 μmol g–1 for CAON. Therefore, the
surface groups such as carboxylic, lactonic, and phenolic groups increased.
Later, CAON was subjected to heat treatment at 723 K. This treatment
reduced the oxygenated surface groups by approximately 30% (CAON723:
284.86 μmol g– 1). At 1023 K, there was
a more considerable removal of the acid groups in CAON1023 (62.10
μmol g–1). Finally, the sample subjected to
greater heat treatment, but that was not modified with HNO3 (CAG1173), presented a decrease in the concentration of acidic surface
groups by approximately 90% if it was compared with the sample that
was oxidized. The removal of these surface groups occurred in the
way described above because it was considered that carboxylic groups
decomposed between 523 and 673 K, lactones between 673 and 923 K,
and phenols between 873 and 1073 K, and temperatures higher than 1173
K decomposed the quinone and pyrone groups. As for the basicity, it
was possible
that it increased due to the presence of chromene and pyrone groups
that only decomposed at high temperatures or due to the electron density
on the graphene layers, specifically the delocalized π electrons.32,33

The hydrophobic factor showed the consequence of the addition
or
removal of the surface groups through the modification of samples.
CAON had the lowest value (1.43) due to its surface chemistry since
it would have a low affinity for nonpolar substances such as these
hydrocarbons. When the surface oxygenated groups were reduced due
to thermal treatment, the hydrophobic factor increased because there
was a greater affinity for nonpolar substances, which made the intensity
of the interaction between these hydrocarbons C6 and the
samples higher.34

Figure 1 shows the
histogram of the pore size distribution of CAG, CAON, and CAG1173.
The QSDFT model for mixed slit pore/cylindrical pore geometry was
chosen because this determination was also made for the other pore
geometries and it showed a lower percentage of error (CAG: 0.97%,
CAON: 0.97%, CAON723: 1.10%, CAON1023: 1.61%, and CAG1173: 1.47%).
Similar values were evident, as shown by the volume of micropores
determined by DR. However, there was a difference for the pore width
of 1 nm (CAG: 0.12, CAON: 0.10, CAG1173: 0.14), where the sample subjected
to thermal treatment increased its porosity by 24%, while the oxidized
sample decreased the pore volume by 14%. The difference was small
but it could be generated by the decomposition of the oxygenated groups,
as mentioned before.

Figure 1 Histogram of the pore size distribution of CAG, CAON,
and CAG1173
for micropores, according to the QSDFT model.

It was expected that samples with the greatest
interaction and
the best adsorption capacities for volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
were the samples subjected to thermal treatment, given their porosity
and surface chemistry. This is corroborated below.

Determination
of Parameters EoWo by Gas-Phase Adsorption Isotherms
Figure 2 shows the
adsorption isotherms of the three hydrocarbons for sample CAON723.
The adsorption data have an uncertainty of 1 × 10–4 mmol g–1. This allowed us to differentiate between
adsorption values in the same isotherm and to detect changes in the
adsorption of the activated carbons that were studied.35 It was observed that benzene was the hydrocarbon
adsorbed in greater proportion. This could be associated with the
molecular size because the adsorbate that had a smaller size would
have fewer restrictions to enter the porous structure of the solid.36−38 Since benzene was the smallest molecule, it would have greater access
to the pores of activated carbon, and therefore more molecules will
be adsorbed compared to cyclohexane, which is approximately 30% larger
than benzene, and compared to the hexane molecule, which is about
twice the size of benzene and had the lowest amount adsorbed.

Figure 2 Adsorption
isotherms on activated carbon CAON723.

As the adsorption process occurred mainly in the
micropores, it
was necessary to characterize these structures. The Dubinin–Radushkevich
model is used for the characterization of activated carbon microporosity.
This model is based on the theory of volume filling of micropores
(TVFM).39 Here, it was found that micropores
seem to be filled with the adsorbate as a liquid due to the adsorption
potential.40

According to TVFM, the
Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) equation
is 1   2  A plot of log2(p0/p) against log W fitted a straight line and allowed us to obtain Wo, which is an important parameter to characterize
a microporous
solid. The value of the slope allowed us to determine the characteristic
energy of adsorption (Eo), which is an
energetic parameter to evaluate the adsorption process.41

Graphical representations of the DR equation
were made to obtain
the EoWo product.
The results shown in Table 3 are consistent with those reported in the literature since
published micropore volume values are within the following ranges:
benzene, 0.21–0.92 cm3 g–1; cyclohexane,
0.11–0.69 cm3 g–1; and hexane,
0.19–0.70 cm3 g–1.3,42−44

A directly proportional
relationship between the micropore volume
and the EoWo product is shown in Figure 3. This was because the adsorption in micropores was associated
with the adsorption potential that existed within the walls. Also,
the increase in the micropore volume implied a greater number of available
micropores with a high adsorption potential value. This was a consequence
of the superposition of the existing fields in those pores.41 Then, the EoWo product showed a significant influence from Eo. This characteristic energy was the result
of the contribution of all of the adsorption potentials generated
when Wo increased, as the adsorption energy
is higher in a microporous surface than in a flat one.6

Figure 3 Relationship between the micropore volume and EoWo for activated carbons.

In Figure 4, an
inverse relationship between the molecular size (benzene: 0.37 nm,
cyclohexane: 0.48 nm, and hexane: 0.67 nm)45,46 and micropore volume is shown; this might be due to the fact that
access to the microporous network was more restricted for larger molecules.36−38,47−49

Figure 4 Relationship between
the molecular size of the adsorbates and micropore
volume.

Figure 4 shows that
the samples with higher micropore volume were those that were subjected
to heat treatment, as this might cause the creation of new micropores
or widening of the narrowest pores3 by
the removal of oxygenated groups that had lower thermal stability.
This did not occur with the original sample or the oxidized one because
they had a higher number of surface groups that limited access of
the molecule to the porous structure. Therefore, there was a lower
value obtained for the Wo parameter.

Determination of Immersion Enthalpies and EoWo Parameter
Immersion
enthalpy manifested the interaction between the porous solid with
each of the solvents (benzene, cyclohexane, and hexane). A plot of
electrical potential as a function of time was used for the calculation
of immersion enthalpy (Figure 5). This plot contained two peaks: the first corresponded to
the immersion process and the second to the electrical calibration
of the calorimeter. The results of the immersion enthalpies are presented
in Table 4.

The results
in Table 4 were calculated
by the average of three determinations and the standard
deviation values are between 0.33 and 2.90 J g–1. The immersion enthalpies obtained were exothermic, which was quite
consistent with the enthalpies reported in the literature, where −ΔHim for benzene presented approximate values
between 85 and 176 J g–1; cyclohexane between 29
and 102 J g–1; and hexane between 31 and 71 J g–1.3,23,24,50−52

Benzene was the
compound with the highest value of enthalpy of
immersion, as shown in Figure 6. Contacting benzene with activated carbon involved the interaction
of regions with high electron density located in the graphene layers
with the π electrons of the benzene molecule. The specific interactions
between graphenic layers and the aromatic rings of benzene increased
when the activated carbon was heat-treated at higher temperatures.9,53 Also, the interaction between the activated carbon and the liquid
increased if there was a similar chemical behavior between the solid
and the solvent.54 This explained why the
enthalpy was greater for an aromatic compound than for a cyclic aliphatic
compound and decreased further for the interaction of an open-chain
aliphatic compound with the porous material.

Figure 6 Calorimetric curves of
CAON1073 in the immersion liquids.

Stoeckli and Kraehenbuehl proposed an interpretation
of the immersion
enthalpy data based on the model of Dubinin for the volume filling
of micropores. They obtained a mathematical relationship between the
immersion enthalpy of a microporous solid in a liquid whose vapor
is adsorbed7 3  In eq 3, β corresponds to
the affinity coefficient, Eo is the characteristic
energy of the solid, Wo is associated
with micropore volume, α
is the thermal expansion coefficient of the liquid, and Vm refers to the liquid molar volume that fills the microporous
system.

The product EoWo was determined from immersion enthalpy results. The
combination
of these two parameters was relevant because it was derived from ΔHim, which is a function of the adsorbate and
the microporous system of the solid.7 As
mentioned above, Eo is related to the
characteristic energy and Wo with the
limiting adsorption volume of the microporous structure.

Figure 7 shows the
direct relationship between the immersion enthalpy and Wo. Martin argues that there was a proportionality between
ΔHim and Eo of the activated carbon, and consequently, a relationship
with the microporous system, expressed in Wo.(6) Furthermore, Rouquerol et al. mentioned
that the interaction between the porous material and the wetting liquid
was closely related to the micropore volume. As the micropore volume
increased, the affinity between the solid and the adsorbate was favored
due to the attractive forces exerted by the activated carbon on the
adsorbate.55−57 In addition, as mentioned above, the inversely proportional
relationship between the molecular size and micropore volume was related
to higher values of Wo in benzene. This
led to a greater contribution
of the adsorption potentials that existed in the micropores, causing
a higher adsorbate–adsorbent energy interaction.

Figure 7 Relationship
between immersion enthalpy and Wo.

Correlation of EoWo Parameters
According to the
results that were
obtained by adsorption isotherms and immersion enthalpies, product EoWo was determined
in two ways: using the theory of micropore volume filling (TVFM),
which provided the DR equation, and the mathematical relationship
proposed by Stoeckli and Kraehenbuehl. Then, a relationship between
these EoWo determinations could be established. Although the values differed,
a directly proportional relationship was observed. The difference
between the values obtained from the DR equation and the Stoeckli
and Kraehenbuehl equation might be related to temperature differences,
because the isotherms of the hydrocarbons were determined at 263 K,
while the immersion calorimetry of the solids in the solvents was
carried out at 293 K. Although a lower temperature favors the adsorption
process, the rate of diffusion decreases at low temperatures, especially
at lower pressures and mainly in the narrowest pores. This is precisely
where the micropore volume filling occurs, as with the nitrogen molecule
when the adsorption isotherms are obtained at 77 K.58

Figure 8 shows the relationship between EoWo obtained by immersion enthalpy as a function
of EoWo calculated
by the adsorption isotherms. This allowed us to establish a relationship
between the microporous structure, the adsorption energy related to
the adsorption potentials of the walls of such pores, and the molecular
interaction between the adsorbate and the activated carbon surface.
The highest EoWo values were those for the adsorbate with the smallest molecular
size and for the samples that were subjected to thermal treatment.
The maximum value was for the sample that was modified at the highest
temperature (1173 K).59 Lower values were
presented by the oxidized samples.

Figure 8 Correlation of the EoWo product obtained by immersion
calorimetry and adsorption
isotherms.

Finally, the relationship between EoWo and the dielectric
constant (benzene:
2.27; cyclohexane: 1.99; and hexane: 1.89) was evaluated (Figure 9), since the characteristic
energy was related to dispersive forces. The dielectric constant was
associated with the degree of polarizability of the molecule. It was
found that there was a directly proportional relationship, possibly
associated with London dispersion forces, which tended to be stronger
between more easily polarizable molecules:46 when the degree of polarizability became higher, it generated a
movement in the electrons that could create an instantaneous dipole
moment, which increased the adsorbate–microporous structure
interaction. At the same time, by increasing the dielectric constant,
the ease with which the distribution of an electron cloud was affected
by an electric field increased.60 The existence
of an attraction force field on the adsorbent meant that the electron
distribution around the molecules was distorted, increasing the dispersive
attractions; as a consequence, the characteristic energy had higher
values, and thus the EoWo product. CAG1173 sample showed the highest values due
to two factors: first, because of the heat treatment, the selective
removal of several surface functional groups located on the edges
of the graphenic layers was performed, allowing more available space
for the entrance of the molecules and thus the interaction with the
accessible pores, showing higher nonspecific interactions between
the adsorbate and the adsorbent; second, this heat treatment favored
the presence of delocalized π electrons,61 which could increase the above-mentioned interactions because
of the distortion in the organization of electrons, which could generate
a greater amount of instantaneous dipole moments, increasing the EoWo value. On the
other hand, the lower values corresponded to CAON, due to the restrictions
for diffusion of the adsorptive liquid on the porous solid caused
by the surface oxygenated groups, which had little affinity for the
molecules that were adsorbed since these were nonpolar. As a result,
this dispersive interaction had lower intensity, decreasing the attractive
forces between molecules and the porous network of the activated carbon.

Figure 9 Relationship
between the dielectric constant of adsorbates and EoWo.

Conclusions
The modifications made to the activated
carbon
affected its textural
and chemical properties. The oxidation process decreased the surface
area, porosity, and the hydrophobic character by increasing the number
of oxygenated groups. This disfavored the adsorption process and the
energy of interaction between the activated carbon and these hydrocarbons
since they were nonpolar molecules. Thermal modification favored the
adsorption process because it increased the surface area, porosity,
and the hydrophobic character. Increasing the temperature removed
oxygenated groups and this improved the affinity between the solid
carbon and the VOCs. This was reflected in the amount of VOC adsorbed,
the enthalpy of immersion, and the EoWo parameters.

Although immersion calorimetry
and the determination of gas-phase
adsorption isotherms are different techniques, they provided information
about the adsorption process and the microporous structure of the
solid. They showed a correlation between the EoWo product calculated by the two
techniques and its relationship with the limiting adsorption volume
of the micropores, the adsorption energy of the system, and the affinity
between the adsorbent and the adsorbate.

The thermodynamics
of the adsorption process was affected by both
the adsorbent and the adsorbate. If the adsorbent was modified, not
only was the Wo affected but also the
characteristic energy. This occurred because adsorption on the micropores
was associated with the adsorption potential contained in the micropore
walls. On the other hand, if the adsorbate had a smaller molecular
size and a higher dielectric constant, it would favor the adsorption
process and increase the energy of adsorption and the adsorbent–adsorbate
interaction due to the affinity between the adsorbent–adsorbate
and the attractive forces exerted by the adsorbate.

Experimental
Section
Materials
A commercial activated carbon prepared from
a coconut shell by physical activation (CAG) was used as the starting
activated carbon (GS50, Carbochem brand - Carbochem Inc., Philadelphia,
PA). The CAG (size: 1 mm) was washed with distilled water and dried
at 373 K for 24 h. The activated carbons were stored under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Physical and chemical modifications were performed.35

Chemical Modification
Activated
carbon (CAG) was subjected
to an oxidation process with a 6 M nitric acid solution (at impregnation
ratio of 1:2) at 85 °C for 6 h to obtain the sample (CAON). It
was later washed with distilled water and dried at 373 K for 24 h.

Physical Modification
CAG was subjected to thermal
treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere for 10 h at a rate of 1.5 K
min–1 and then for 1 h at 1173 K to obtain CAG1173.
CAON was also exposed to heat treatment at two different temperatures:
for 8 h at a rate of 1.5 K min–1 and then for 1
h at 1023 K under a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain CAON1023; and for
5 h at a rate of 1.5 K min–1 and then for 1 h at
723 K under a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain CAON723. Thus, five samples
were obtained: CAG, CAG1173, CAON, CAON1023, and CAON723.

The
thermal treatments were carried out in a Thermolyne horizontal-position
furnace with a stainless steel tube with a quartz tube boat. The pyrolysis
temperatures were chosen based on the thermal stabilities of the surface
functional groups.62

Physicochemical
Characterization
Nitrogen Adsorption Isotherms
Nitrogen
adsorption isotherms
were obtained using an Autosorb 3B, Quantachrome at 77 K, to determine
the apparent surface area using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) model, the micropore volume and characteristic energy using
the Dubinin–Radushkevich (DR) model, and the pore size distribution
by applying quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT) analysis.
The samples were previously degassed at 473 K for 24 h.35

Boehm Titrations
These were used
to determine the content
of oxygenated groups on the activated carbons, evaluated through the
total acidity and basicity of samples.

Total acidity
One hundred milligrams of activated carbon
were mixed with 25 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution. This mixture was stirred
for five days at 293 K. Ten milliliters of each solution in contact
with the solid were titrated with previously standardized HCl solution.63,64

Total basicity
One hundred milligrams of activated
carbon were mixed with 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution. The mixture was
stirred for five days at 293 K. Ten milliliters of each solution in
contact with the solid were titrated with previously standardized
NaOH solution.63,64

The titrations were performed
using a TitroLine α plus titrator from Schott Instruments.

Proximate Analysis
Proximate analysis for the determination
of moisture, volatile matter, and ashes of the samples was performed
according to ASTM standards. The fixed carbon content was determined
by the difference from the other tests.65−67

Determination
of Gas-Phase Adsorption Isotherms
The
adsorption isotherms were determined in a sortometer assembled in
the laboratory (Figure 10). Three adsorptive liquids were used: benzene, cyclohexane,
and hexane. The adsorptive liquid was placed in a stainless steel
cell with a capacity of 5.0 mL. Then, it was passed through a stainless
steel pipe and kept in a tank (an autotransformer was used to keep
the tank at a constant temperature of 343 K), where, by the increase
of the temperature it reached its vapor phase.

Figure 10 Scheme of the homemade
sortometer used to determine the gas-phase
adsorption isotherms.

For solid degassing,
1.000 g of sample was weighed into a glass
cell, then placed in the sortometer, and introduced into an oven connected
to an autotransformer to regulate the temperature (423 K); degassing
was complete when the pressure was constant. This pressure should
be close to 2 × 10–3 mbar.

The temperature
of the adsorption system was set at 263 K using
a thermostat. The dosing system of the adsorptive liquid was controlled
by the adsorbate valve and the sample valve. Initially, the adsorbate
valve was opened until the required pressure value was reached and
then the valve was closed. Subsequently, it was verified that the
pressure value was constant for approximately 5 min. Finally, the
valve of the sample was opened so that the adsorptive liquid entered
into the sample cell where the solid was stored, and the adsorption
process was carried out. The pressure change was recorded until it
remained constant and then the sample valve was closed. The data collection
was done by software that captured pressure changes occurring in the
cell where the activated carbon was kept. This procedure was repeated
for each of the points of the isotherm until the adsorbate vapor pressure
was reached.

Determination of Immersion Enthalpies
Immersion enthalpies
of activated carbon in solvents were determined at 293 K in a homemade
Tian-Calvet heat conduction calorimeter, which used thermopiles as
thermal sensors.36 The calorimeter had
an aluminum block as the heat reservoir, which was fitted with a stainless
steel cell that contained 10 mL of solvent. One hundred milligrams
of activated carbon were weighed in a glass vial and placed in the
calorimeter cell. The output electric potential was recorded for approximately
40 min until a stable baseline was reached with a variation of about
2 × 10–6 V. Later, the sample was immersed
into the solvent, and the electric potential increase was recorded
until the baseline was attained again. Then, the electrical calibration
of the calorimeter was performed.68,69

The
characteristics of the chemicals that were determined are shown in Table 5.
