Alzheimer’s disease is the
most common form of dementia
that affects about 50 million of sufferers worldwide. A major role
for the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease has
been associated with the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), which
is a protease cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein. The
amyloid precursor protein is an integral membrane protein with a single
transmembrane domain. Here, we assessed the structural integrity of
the transmembrane domain within oriented phosphatidylcholine lipid
bilayers and determined the tilt angle distribution and dynamics of
various subdomains using solid-state NMR and attenuated total reflectance
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies. Although the overall secondary
structure of the transmembrane domain is α-helical, pronounced
conformational and topological heterogeneities were observed for the
γ- and, to a lesser extent, the ζ-cleavage site, with
pronounced implications for the production of Aβ and related
peptides, the development of the disease, and pharmaceutical innovation.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder and is the most common form of dementia. The statistics for
2015 states that nearly 47 million people worldwide have AD or a related
dementia. The disease is characterized by brain cell destruction,
memory loss, and deterioration of cognitive and behavioral processes,
severe enough to affect work, lifelong hobbies, and social life. Symptoms
worsen over time, and the disease is always fatal. Small soluble or
protofibrillar assemblies of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) are
believed to be involved in the onset and progression of AD.1−4 The length of Aβ peptides varies from 38 to 43 residues, with
Aβ40 and Aβ42 being the major species.5 All Aβ peptides are products of a proteolytic cleavage
of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), an integral membrane protein
with a single transmembrane domain (TMD), expressed in many tissues
and concentrated in the synapses of neurons.6−9 Its primary function is not known,
although cell-associated APP has been shown to be involved in some
aspects of neuronal development, signalling, intracellular transport,
and neuronal hemostasis.10 Nevertheless,
it is most commonly studied in connection with Aβ peptides′
production.6−8,11

Notably, the
resulting cleavage products and their oligomeric fiber
intermediates have been suggested to be involved in memory loss via
their cell cytotoxity. Because membranes assist in the formation of
such toxic species, the bilayer interactions are considered of utmost
importance for the development of AD and need further investigation.12,13

Amyloidogenic processing of APP begins with proteolytic cleavage
of the bulk ectodomain by membrane-bound β-secretase, leading
to a secreted fragment sAPPβ and a membrane-bound β-C-terminal
fragment (β-CTF), also known as C99.8,14 Following
transmembrane proteolysis of β-CTF by γ-secretase at the
ε- and γ-sites (Figure 1) results in Aβ production and release of the
APP intracellular domain.8 Accumulated
evidence suggests that Aβ peptides are released via a sequential
proteolytic cleavage mechanism, where the first cut occurs at residue
720 or 719 of β-CTF, that is, at the ε-site located at
the cytoplasmic edge of the TMD (Figure 1).15 Products
Aβ49/Aβ48 remain membrane-bound and are further processed
in a sequential mode through the ζ-site (residue 717 of APP)
to yield Aβ46.16 Aβ46 is the
precursor of Aβ40 and Aβ42, processed via γ-cleavage.17 The Aβ production in the β-secretory
pathway is promoted by APP homodimer formation,18 and further cleavage that generates e.g., Aβ38 and
Aβ37 will occur only if not inhibited by strong dimerization
between two TMD helices.19,20

Figure 1 Partial sequence of APP,
numbered following the full-length protein
sequence. The TMD region in LMPG micelles from amino acid 700 to 723
is underlined;21 in bilayers, the helix
ends at L720/V721.25 The shaded sequence
marks APP_TM4K, the region synthesized for this study. Underlined
with red are isotopically labeled amino acids that were incorporated
for solid-state NMR studies. Positions of the glycines in three consecutive
GxxxG sequences are shown in bold and numbered according to the APP
sequence (i.e., 696, 700, 704, 708). Cleavage sites of α-, β-,
and γ-secretases are indicated by triangles. γ-secretase
cleavage sites correspond among others to amino acids 709, 710, 711,
and 713 and upon cleavage by secretases produce Aβ38, Aβ39,
Aβ40, and Aβ42, respectively.

Multidimensional solution NMR spectroscopy in micellar environments
indicates that the TMD of APP is a curved helix with its apex close
to G708 and G709, that is, in the center of the hydrophobic region,
which results in a 17 ± 7° change in helix alignment.21,22 However, MD calculations show that this kinked structure is specific
for micellar but not bilayer environments.23 At its amide terminus, the TMD is connected by a loop to another
less-stable helical domain in the juxtamembrane region oriented along
the lysomyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) micellar surface.21 When investigated at peptide-to-dodecylphosphocholine
(DPC) ratios of 1/50, a mixture of monomer and dimer occurs with closely
related structures.22,23 The dimer interaction site involves
the extended heptad repeat I702–L723 encompassing the γ-secretase
cleavage sites.22

In view of the
dynamic nature of the APP TMD and the influence
of membrane curvature on structural details, biophysical measurements
in lipid bilayers are sought after.23 Indeed,
magic angle spinning NMR chemical shift measurements indicate that
in lipid bilayers helical and nonhelical conformations of individual
residues within the TMD are in slow exchange,24 conformational equilibria that are sensitive to lipid composition
and temperature. Whereas helical structures are favored by cryotemperatures
and/or PG lipids, the amount of nonhelical conformations at residues
around the γ-cleavage site increases in membranes mimicking
more closely the brain lipid composition and at room temperature.24,25 The helical TMD ends around residues L720/V721, which positions
the ε cleavage in a less-structured region.25

In lipid bilayers, solid-state NMR intermolecular
cross-peaks suggest
that the APP TMD tends to assemble into a right-handed coiled-coil
dimer,25 in agreement with recent MD calculations.26 The interaction surface of the homodimer includes
G700, G704, and G708, but not G709 and A713.,25a Indeed, such GxxxG motifs are known to mediate
transmembrane helix dimerization,27 and
mutational studies have confirmed the importance of these glycines
for APP processing.28−30 Furthermore, accumulated structural and biochemical
data suggest that the conformational variability of the TMD segment
plays an important role in APP enzymatic cleavage and therefore in
Aβ production.24,26,28,31,32 Thereby, intramembraneous
proteolysis by γ-secretase probably requires local unraveling
of the helical secondary structure of the TMD to expose the backbone
carbonyl carbons for nucleophilic attack by polarized water in the
enzyme active site.

Importantly, whereas a number of different
conformers are observed
during MD calculations, the type of conformer is heavily dependent
on the macroscopic shape and curvature of the membrane model system,31 where the right-handed coiled-coil dimer is
dominant in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers26 but a left-handed parallel dimer predominates
in dodecylphosphocholine micelles.22 Important
structural details such as the helical outlines, the overall molecular
shape, or the topology of the dimer differ between micelle and lipid
bilayer environments.21−25 Therefore, these previous investigations underline the importance
of structural investigations in liquid crystalline bilayers. Here,
we used solid-state NMR spectroscopy of supported planar lipid bilayers
to study conformational details of the TM homodimer, where the same
peptide used in a previous NMR investigation was studied by highly
complementary approaches.24 The investigations
are all performed in liquid crystalline bilayers, which imposes additional
challenges due to the fluidity of the lipids and the dynamics of the
embedded peptides. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is unique in providing
accurate structural information under such near-physiological conditions.
This is particularly important when a lipid bilayer environment is
required to reveal precise structural details of APP but also because
its cleavage products aggregate in a lipid-dependent manner.12,13 Notably, these are the first solid-state NMR investigations of the
APP TMD reconstituted in supported lipid bilayers that are oriented
relative to the magnetic field of the NMR spectrometer. In particular,
the data reveal a structuration into subdomains, dynamic features
of individual sites and the resulting membrane topologies, and orientational
distribution and conformational heterogeneity of the TMD.

Results
Attenuated
Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR) Spectroscopy
To investigate the global secondary
structure of the APP_TM4K peptides reconstituted into POPC bilayers
and the alignment of lipids and peptides in the sample and to assess
the overall peptide orientation (i.e., transmembrane or in-plane),
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used. When recorded at ambient temperatures,
the amide I region of the spectrum (1700–1600 cm–1) exhibited a symmetric peak with a maximum at 1653 cm–1, characteristic of predominantly helical conformations (Figure 2). Fourier self-deconvolution
revealed several components within the amide I region, which were
quantified by an iterative least-squares curve-fitting procedure.33 The calculated secondary structure content was
found to be about 74% for the helical structure and 18% for random
coil and turn conformations. The remaining 8% are within the experimental
error.

Figure 2 ATR-FTIR spectra of 2 mol % APP_TM4K reconstituted into oriented
POPC bilayers. The red spectrum was obtained with 90°-polarized
light, whereas the green spectrum was obtained with 0°-polarized
light. The calculated dichroic spectrum (black spectrum) is the difference
between the red and green spectra. Spectra are recorded at ambient
temperature and have been shifted for better visualization.

The amide I region of the spectra
was also used to determine the
orientation of the α-helical APP_TM4K peptide relative to the
POPC hydrocarbon chains of the bilayer. A dichroic spectrum of the
amide I band is strongly 90° polarized, as seen from the positive
deviation in the helical region (Figure 2, black trace). This indicates that the α-helix
orientation is perpendicular to the germanium plate and therefore
parallel to the acyl chains of the lipids. A quantitative estimation
of the helix orientation was obtained by computing an isotropic dichroic
ratio of 1.16 using the lipids′ ν(C=O) band at
1738 cm–1 as a reference.34 With this calibration, the dichroic ratio of the amide I band was
1.74. When only the helical component of the amide I band was analyzed,
the tilt angle relative to the normal of the germanium plate was found
to be ≤20°. The orientation of the lipid acyl chains was
also assessed. The lipid dichroic ratio for the band at 2872 cm–1 (νs (CH3)) was found to be 3.71
(data not shown), and accordingly, the tilt angle between acyl chains
and the normal of the germanium crystal was ≤25°. This
result indicates that APP_TM4K reconstituted into POPC bilayers forms
a predominantly transmembrane α-helix.

15N and 2H Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy:
APP_TM4K Orientation and Conformation
Local conformational
details of the membrane-inserted APP_TM4K helix were revealed by preparing
peptides selectively labeled with stable 15N and 2H isotopes, followed by reconstitution into uniaxially oriented POPC
bilayers and solid-state NMR investigations at 296 K (Figure 3A–E). In the presence
of POPC, dynamic nonhelical conformers are favored at some positions
within the overall helical transmembrane region, similar to the observations
made in brain lipid extracts and membrane mimetics.24 These are thought to be of particular importance for cleavage
by secretases.19,24,25 Peptides with three different labeling schemes were used: 15N-Gly708/2H-Ala713, 15N-Ala713/2H-Ala701, and 15N-Val717/2H-Ala701.

Figure 3 Proton-decoupled 15N (A–C) and 2H
solid-state NMR spectra (D, E) of 2 mol % APP_TM4K peptides reconstituted
into oriented POPC lipid bilayers. The labeled sites are 15N-Gly708 (A), 15N-Ala713 (B), 15N-Val717 (C), 2H-Ala701 (D), and 2H-Ala713 (E). (F) Representative
proton-decoupled 31P spectrum of a sample. All spectra
were obtained with the membrane normal oriented parallel to the magnetic
field direction. In panels (D) and (E), the central small splitting
of ≤1.5 kHz is from residual deuterium of the membrane hydration
shell.62 The spectra were recorded at ambient
temperature. The smooth lines overlaying the spectra are spectral
simulations with the following parameters: the angle between the main
axis of the α-helix and membrane normal were (A) 23°, peak
maximum at 192 ppm; (B) 70°, peak maximum at 85 ppm; and (C)
15°, peak maximum at 210 ppm, or the Cα–Cβ
bond angles were 49 and 52°, respectively (D and E). The Gaussian
distributions for the peptide alignment are 3° (A), 35°
(B), 20° (C), and 10° (D, E). For the simulation of the 31P spectrum (F), the Gaussian distribution of 3° was
summed up with 25% powder pattern. A spectral line width of 500 Hz
(A–C, F) and 2 kHz (D, E) was applied.

On the one hand, the proton-decoupled 15N solid-state
NMR spectra of the 15N-labeled peptide amide bonds provide
a direct indicator of the approximate tilt angle of the 15N–1H-vector and thereby also of helical domains.35 Whereas chemical shifts in the 200 ppm region
are associated with transmembrane helices, on the opposite, values
<100 ppm are indicative of in-planar orientations. On the other
hand, the 2H quadrupolar splitting of methyl-deuterated
alanine provides highly complementary information on the orientation
of the Cα–Cβ2H3 vector, which can be used to refine the helical tilt and
pitch angles.36,37 Finally, proton-decoupled 31P solid-state NMR spectra were recorded for each sample to
assess the quality and the alignment of the lipids. The POPC lipids
predominantly resonate at 30 ppm, typical of phosphatidylcholine molecules
in liquid-disordered bilayers that are oriented with their normal
parallel to the magnetic field direction and thereby the bilayer normal.36,37 In the presence of polypeptides that disrupt the membrane packing,
the 31P solid-state NMR spectra often extend up to −15
ppm that arise from different lipid alignments.38,39 A representative spectrum is shown in Figure 3F and spectra from other samples in the Supporting
Information (Figure S1).

Figure 3A shows
the 15N-Gly708 spectrum with a chemical shift value at
191 ppm, which indicates that Gly708 is in a transmembrane orientation.35 The line width at half-height is <12 ppm,
demonstrating that the peptide is well-oriented with respect to the
magnetic field direction. The 2H spectrum of Ala713 recorded
on the same sample did not exhibit one clearly distinguishable quadrupolar
splitting, but rather a distribution of Cα–Cβ2H3 alignments that add up to
the shape seen in Figure 3E. The width of the spectrum is ∼20 kHz, which can
be simulated by Cα–Cβ2H3 alignments relative to the membrane normal (magnetic
field direction) at an average angle of 52° and a Gaussian distribution
with 10° standard deviation (Figure 3E).

When this same site was labeled
with 15N, the corresponding 15N chemical shift
solid-state NMR spectrum of Ala713 exhibited
a complex spectral line shape, where the 15N chemical shift
values were spread over 160 ppm (Figure 3B), that is, covering almost the full chemical
shift anisotropy, indicating that the 1H–15N vector of the Ala713 site is characterized by a wide range of orientations
relative to the membrane normal, due to structural and/or orientational
heterogeneity of the Ala713 site. Notably, the 2H solid-state
NMR spectrum recorded from the 2H3-Ala701 label
of the same sample did not resemble a powder pattern line shape (Figure 3D), as would have
been expected if the peptide or the sample as a whole was misaligned.
In addition, the corresponding proton-decoupled 31P solid-state
NMR spectrum exhibited a line shape typical of well-aligned POPC lipids
(Figure S1C). Consequently, the combination
of 15N and 2H solid-state NMR spectra of Ala713
(Figure 3B,E) shows
that this site adopts a range of different orientations, which exchange
only slowly on the NMR time scale (kHz range).

When the peptide
carrying the 15N-Val717 site is reconstituted
into uniaxially oriented membranes, 15N chemical shift
intensities are observed at 209 ± 28 ppm (Figure 3C). Although a broad spectral resonance with
a correspondingly higher noise level is observed, the chemical shift
values undoubtedly indicate a transmembrane orientation of the Val717
segment.35 The width of the spectrum points
toward a distribution of orientations around a main value of the Val717 15N–1H vector relative to the magnetic field
direction. Whereas the mean value of 209 ppm is indicative of a helical
tilt angle around 15° (5–25° depending on the pitch
angle), a rather large range of possible helix/15N–1H vector alignments from 0 to 50° results from taking
into account the full spectral width (Figure 3C).

The same peptide carrying the 15N-Val717 label was also
labeled at 2H-Ala701, and the corresponding 2H spectrum exhibits a maximal quadrupolar splitting of 26 kHz (Figure 3D). The width of
the peptide spectrum and its shape point toward a heterogeneous distribution
of alignments also for Ala701.

Discussion
Multidimensional
solution-,21,22 MAS-,24,25 and oriented solid-state NMR spectroscopies, as well as MD simulations,23 all agree that in membrane environments the
TMD of APP exhibits predominantly helical conformations. The helix
extends from residues G700–L723 in LMPG micelles21 and from K699–K724 in the presence of
DPC22 and ends around residues L720/V721
in lipid bilayers, that is, the position of the ε-cleavage site.25 ATR FTIR spectra indicate a global tilt angle
of the helical part of approximately 20° (Figure 2). Furthermore, for several amino acid positions
along the TMD, equilibria between helical and nonhelical conformers
were detected by MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy.24,25 Whereas helical conformations are favored by cryotemperatures and/or
the presence of PG lipids,25 the amount
of nonhelical conformations at residues close to the amino- and carboxy-termini
of the helix and around the γ-cleavage site increases in POPC,
brain lipid extracts, or model membranes mimicking the brain lipid
composition and at higher temperatures.24 Here, such previous investigations of conformational equilibria
were considerably extended and refined not only by identifying nonhelical
residues but also by investigating the structure, dynamics, and topological
distribution of the resulting transmembrane subdomains. The supported
POPC lipid bilayers used here were selected to obtain new and more
detailed structural insight into physiological temperatures and under
conditions emphasizing the nonhelical structures also observed in
brain lipids.

Using solid-state NMR on planar supported lipid
bilayers, orientational
restraints have been obtained from various sites along the TMD of
APP labeled selectively with 2H3-alanine and/or 15N at the corresponding peptide bond. In contrast to MAS solid-state
NMR, the technique exploits the full range of the chemical shift anisotropy
and thereby provides information, at atomic resolution if a site is
part of a well-defined secondary structure, on motions that cause
dynamic averaging as well as structural information in terms of angles
and their distribution. Importantly, in the experiments designed here
both the amide 15N and the 2H3-alaninine
labels reveal details about the alignment and the alignment distribution
of the peptide backbone relative to the magnetic field of the NMR
spectrometer (Bo), which is collinear with the sample normal.
The 31P solid-state NMR spectra indicate well-oriented
samples, where all of them exhibit closely related 31P
NMR line shapes (Figures 3F and S1). The pronounced differences
of 2H and 15N spectra from various labeled sites
of the peptides (Figure 3A–E) thus represent conformational and topological differences
of the polypeptide, rather than artifacts of individual preparations.

The 15N solid-state NMR spectra of Gly708 and Val717
are indicative of structured helical domains with transmembrane topology
(Figure 4), thereby
extending previous NMR and MD structural data.21−25 Notably, the Gly708 site represents the apex of the
bent helical conformation, which is observed only in micellar environments.21−23 Whereas the simulations in Figure 3 compare the spectra that result from a specific alignment
to those from the experimental result, Figure 4 indicates all combinations of tilt and pitch
angles that agree with a 15N spectrum. On the other hand,
the 2H spectra are a direct indicator of Cα–Cβ orientations relative to magnetic field
direction Bo (coincident with the membrane normal) and
highly sensitive to its mosaicity.37

Figure 4 Contour plots
illustrating the helical topologies of the APP_TM4K
peptide, which agree with the experimental measurements of the 15N chemical shift of (A) (192 ± 7) ppm of Gly708 and
(B) (209 ± 28) ppm of Val717. The x-axis shows
the rotational pitch angle around the helix long axis, whereas the y-axis shows the tilt angle, relative to the membrane normal.
The gray area represents the possible pitch/tilt angular pairs that
agree with the most intense chemical shift value (bold line) and the
chemical shifts corresponding to the intensities at half-height, where
the intervals of the contours are in steps of 7 ppm.

Furthermore, the effects of wobbling and rocking
motions of the
helices on the tilt and rotational pitch angles are estimated in Figures S2 and S3. These spectral simulations
indicate that taking into consideration typical motions of transmembrane
sequences40,41 shifts the fits to a more transmembrane
orientation and larger fluctuations of the Cα–Cβ bonds. Both change by about 5–10°, thereby
also providing an estimate of error bars that arise from uncertainties
about the exact motional regime.

In an oriented POPC lipid bilayer
and at ambient temperatures,
the A713 15N solid-state spectrum shows a broad resonance
with a maximum at 85 ppm extending to about 200 ppm (Figure 3B). The spectral line shape
is indicative of a preference for angles close to perpendicular to
the membrane normal albeit with additional alignments of the N–H
vector covering almost all possible directions. A spectral simulation
with a helix tilt angle of 70° and a Gaussian distribution of
35° reproduces the experimental spectrum reasonably well (Figure 3B). Therefore, the
broad, nonaveraged 15N spectral line shape (Figure 3B) refines previous MAS NMR
measurements, which had been rationalized by exchange between helical
and nonhelical conformations that is slow on the millisecond time
scale.24 Despite the broad distribution
of the 15N–1H vector, the 2H-solid-state NMR spectrum from the deuterated methyl group of the
same amino acid agrees with a comparatively well-defined tilt angle
of the Cα–Cβ bond of 52 ±
10° (Figure 3E).
The combination of both the 15N and 2H measurements
indicates that the relative orientation of the Cα–Cβ bond undergoes only modest variation
relative to the sample normal, when at the same time, it suggests
that rotation around the Cα–Cβ bond scans a wide variety of N–H alignments (Figure 5). Additional variability of
the NH bond topology is obtained through motions involving the Ramachandran
angles. An alternative analysis of the topological restraints of the
A713 2H data is presented in Figure S4, together with a spectral simulation of the corresponding 15N spectrum. Both approaches indicate that the transmembrane
helical conformation is interrupted at this site. Notably, residue
713 is next to the γ-secretase cleavage site V711/I712 and the
break in helical conformation may be important for enzymatic activity
(Figure 1). Our data
thus nicely consolidate previous MAS solid-state NMR investigations
of I712 and A713 at higher temperatures, which suggested mixed conformations
in this region but suffered from low signal-to-noise ratios.24,25

Figure 5 Model
of the Ala713 site. (A) Oriented 2H solid-state
NMR spectra (Figure 3E) are indicative of an alignment of the Cα–Cβ vector (black line and cone) at 52 ± 10°
relative to the magnetic field direction (Bo, arrows pointing
upward). The predominant 15N chemical shift intensity agrees
with a 15N–H vector alignment of ca. 70 ± 35°
(or because of symmetry 110 ± 35°, blue line). (B) The broad
line shape of the 15N spectrum with smaller intensities
reaching into the 200 ppm region indicates that NH alignments parallel
to Bo also occur (Figure 3B). Indeed, rotation around the Cα–Cβ bond results in a range of NH orientations
from nearly parallel to Bo to 110°. The carbons are
black, nitrogen is blue, oxygen is red, and hydrogen is white. Additional
degrees of freedom occur around two Ramachandran angles Φ, Ψ
(not shown).

The V717 site represents
the most C-terminal residue investigated
in this article (Figure 3C). The spectrum is indicative of a transmembrane helical arrangement
albeit with considerable topological and/or conformational dispersion.
Interestingly, this site is part of the V717/I718 ζ-cleavage
site (Figure 1).

Finally, the 2H solid-state NMR spectrum of A701 (Figure 3D) agrees with a
Cα–Cβ bond orientation of
49 ± 10°. However, additional contributions are needed to
fully account for the spectral features. The predominant 2H quadrupolar splitting of ∼27 kHz indicates that motions
are slow or intermediate on the corresponding time scale (Figure 3D,E). Indeed, in
the same lipid bilayer used here, two sets of Cα,
Cβ and CO chemical shifts were observed in 13C MAS solid-state NMR spectra, indicative of helical and nonhelical
conformations in slow exchange.24 In micellar
environments, position 701 is within the first helical turn of the
TMD.21,22 Notably, the residue is also within a domain
that has been identified to be part of the cholesterol binding site,21 a lipid important for γ-secretase activity
and raft formation.42,43 The dynamic nature of the APP
TMD contrasts with that of other membrane-associated polypeptide sequences
for which it was possible to determine a unique topology/tilt angle
for the helical domain.41,44,45

Previous investigations show that the same transmembrane sequence
investigated here adopts a right-handed coiled-coil dimer arrangement
in POPC bilayers,25 in excellent agreement
with studies in the presence of detergent micelles at similar peptide-to-amphiphile
ratios.22,46 Familial Alzheimer mutants of APP have been
found to increase the population of monomers46 when at the same time increased dimerization results in decreased
Aβ production.29,47 Notably, only small differences
in chemical shift were observed in previous investigations when the
mono- and dimer were compared with each other in micellar environments,
suggesting only small conformational changes upon dimer formation.22

A model summarizing our structural data
is shown in Figure 6. Whereas residue 701 is relatively
mobile being close to the amino-terminal end of the transmembrane
helix, residue 708 is well-structured and exhibits a unique and well-defined
topology in POPC planar lipid bilayers. Notably, 708 is also part
of the helical domain involved in homodimer formation in lipid bilayer
where the interaction surface involves G700, G704, and G708.25 Residue 708 is also involved in dimerization
when the APP TMD is studied in DPC micellar environments,22 albeit the handedness of the dimer arrangement
depends on the membrane curvature,23 being
left-handed in micelles22 and right-handed
in bilayer environments.25 On the one hand,
the bilayer topologies measured here (Figure 4) agree with coiled-coil helical crossing
angles ≤60° observed in DPC micelles22 or previously established models that were used to analyze
measurements in phospholipid bilayers.25 On the other hand, in our study, both the amino- and carboxy-terminal
helices adopt transmembrane alignments, whereas a pronounced kink
between these helices and consecutively a more in-planar alignment
of the N-terminal domain have been suggested for the monomeric protein
in detergent micelles.21

Figure 6 Model summarizing our
structural data of the TMD dimer, including
sites of structural variability/flexibility.

Indeed, not only the conformation of the cleavage site itself
but
also the overall shape of the transmembrane domain has been suggested
to be important for interactions with the secretases.21 The oriented solid-state NMR data presented here (Figures 3 and 5) show a conformational equilibrium, which interrupts the
helix around position 713 and provides flexibility for increased topological
heterogeneity of its carboxy-terminal domain including residue 717.
The latter is characterized by a 15N–H vector being
aligned in a transmembrane fashion, albeit covering a considerable
angular distribution. In addition to the A713 residue (Figure 3B,E), the G708/G709 site has
also been identified as a site with high flexibility.19,21,22 Such hinge regions within the
helical domain probably help the TMD to fit into the secretase binding
site. At the same time, pronounced conformational and orientational
heterogeneity of the γ- and, to a smaller extent, the ζ-cleavage
site (Figure 3B,C)
may have important implications for the cleavage mechanism of APP
and hence for Aβ production and can serve as sites of enzymatic
activity.

This view of a rather heterogeneous structural arrangement,
enriched
by detailed information on the topology of 15N–H
and Cα–Cβ2H3 directors, much refines MAS solid-state NMR investigations,
which showed the coexistence of nonhelical and helical conformations24 as well as MD simulations, which exhibit a dynamic
exchange of conformers where the conformational equilibria are shifted
by single-residue mutagenesis19 or lipid
composition.26 Additional structural and
topological details could be obtained from two-dimensional solid-state
NMR spectra of uniformly 15N-labelled APP reconstituted
into oriented phospholipid bilayers48 although
the dynamic nature of some of the sites will probably make their investigation,
together with many other residues, more difficult. The dimerization
and structural transitions, which are regulated by the lipid composition24 and membrane curvature,31 may be coupled to each other and important for regulation of availability
and access of the substrate to the γ-secretase enzymatic site.
Notably, in recent electron microscopy structural investigations,
single transmembrane domains of γ-secretase also appear quite
dynamic49 and such regulatory mechanisms
may be enhanced by the enzyme activity itself, being dependent on
the membrane lipid composition.42,43,47

Experimental Section
APP_TM4K Peptide Synthesis
The 30
amino-acid-long polypeptides,
which correspond to the transmembrane part of full-length APP (amino
acids 699–726, KGAIIGLMVGGVVIATVIVITLVMLKKK), were synthesized
by solid-phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc chemistry50 on a Millipore 9050 automated peptide synthesizer (Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany) using a TentaGel R RAM resin (polyethylene glycol
polystyrene-graft copolymer support) with a degree of substitution
of 0.190 meq/g (Rapp Polymere GmbH, Tübingen, Germany). The
synthesis was carried out at 40 °C, with double couplings for
Val715 and Ile716 and acetylation of nonreacted peptides. Side-chain
protecting groups and peptide cleavage from the resin was carried
out at room temperature for 4 h in 94% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) with the addition of 2.5% ethanedithiol, 1% of the silane derivative
triisopropylsilan and 2.5% water as scavenger cocktail. The yield
of the crude peptide varied from 60 to 90%.

Peptides were purified
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a reversed-phase
Prontosyl 300-5-C4 (particles size of 5 mm with 300 Å pores)
column (Bishoff, Leonberg, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of
a gradient of isopropanol with 0.1% TFA (buffer B) mixed with water
and 0.1% TFA (buffer A). The content of buffer B increased from 10
to 60% in 23 min at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. All of the solvents
were of highest purity (HPLC grade, Sigma-Aldrich Chimie S.a.r.l.,
Lyon, France). The quality of the purified peptides was assessed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) with a time-of-flight
(TOF) mass spectrometer (Autoflex from Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
The yield of the pure peptide varied between 10 and 30%. Purified
APP_TM4K peptides were lyophilized 3 times from 10 mM HCl to remove
the TFA counterions.51 In the presence
of TFA, FTIR spectra show a sharp and intense peak at 1675–1680
cm–1. Such an intensity is absent in the experimental
spectra, indicating that the TFA ions have been successfully removed,
as demonstrated previously.51

Attenuated
Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(ATR-FTIR)
ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS
55 infrared spectrophotometer (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a
liquid-nitrogen-cooled MCT detector. The internal reflection element
(IRE) was a germanium (Ge) ATR plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm3) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal
reflections. A total of 128 scans were accumulated for each spectrum
to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Spectra were recorded at a nominal
resolution of 2 cm–1. The spectrophotometer was
continuously purged with dried air. All of the measurements were carried
out at 24 °C.

APP_TM4K peptides were dissolved in HFIP
(Sigma-Aldrich Chimie S.a.r.l., Lyon, France) to a final concentration
of 2 mg/mL. This solution was mixed with POPC lipids (Avanti Polar
Lipids, Alabaster, AL) dissolved in chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich Chimie
S.a.r.l., Lyon, France) to obtain a 1:50 peptide-to-lipid ratio. The
solvents were evaporated, and the sample was spread on the surface
of the Ge plate to form a thin film of oriented multilayers.

Secondary
Structure Determination
Fourier self-deconvolution
was applied to increase the resolution of the spectra in the amide
I region, which is highly sensitive to the protein secondary structure.
Lorentzian line shapes were used for self-deconvolution and a Gaussian
line shape for apodization. A least-squares iterative fitting of the
spectrum between 1700 and 1600 cm–1 using a mixture
of Gaussian/Lorentzian line shapes was performed, and the area belonging
to different secondary structures was determined. Prior to curve fitting,
a straight base line passing through the ordinates at 1700 and 1600
cm–1 was subtracted. To avoid the introduction of
artifacts, the fitting was done on the nondeconvoluted spectrum. The
proportion of a particular structural element was computed to be the
sum of the area of all of the fitted bands with their maximum in the
frequency region concomitant with that particular structure divided
by the area of all of the Lorentzian bands having their maximum between
1689 and 1615 cm–1.33

Orientation of the Secondary Structure
The thickness
of the deposited film was considered to be small compared with the
IR wavelength, and the “thin film” approximation was
used when establishing the equations describing the dichroic ratio
as a function of the orientational order parameter.33 Spectra were recorded with the incident light polarized
either parallel (0°) or perpendicular (90°) relative to
the plane of the internal reflection element (IRE), that is, the Ge
plate. Polarization was expressed as dichroic ratio, RATR = A90/A0°, and the mean angle between the helix
axes and a normal to the ATR plate surface was calculated. In these
calculations, an angle of 27° between the long axis of the α-helix
and the C=O dipole moment was taken into account.33,52,53 The POPC ester stretch ν(C=O)
vibrations at 1738 cm–1 were used to characterize
the isotropic dichroic ratio.

Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
The following isotopic
labeling schemes were introduced into the APP_TM4K peptides during
solid-phase synthesis: 15N-Gly708/2H-Ala713, 15N-Ala713/2H-Ala701, and 15N-Val717/2H-Ala701. The oriented samples were prepared as described
in detail in ref (54). A peptide-to-lipid ratio of 1:50 was obtained by mixing 3.5 mg
of dry peptide dissolved in HFIP (Sigma-Aldrich Chimie S.a.r.l., Lyon,
France) with 46.4 mg of POPC dissolved in chloroform. Before NMR measurements,
the samples were equilibrated at 93% relative humidity at room temperature.
For 2H experiments, the saturated solution was prepared
with deuterium-depleted water with a residual degree of deuteration
of 10–6. During the solid-state NMR experiments,
the samples were cooled by a stream of air at 296 K.

Proton-decoupled 31P solid-state NMR spectra were recorded at 202.41 MHz on
a Bruker Avance wide-bore NMR spectrometer operating at 11.7 T (Bruker,
Rheinstetten, Germany). A Hahn echo pulse sequence55 was used with the typical parameters: 1H B1 field 33 kHz, 90° pulse length 10 μs, echo delay
100 μs, spectral width 100 kHz, 2048 data points, typically
512 scans, and repetition time 3 s. The spectra were referenced relative
to 85% phosphoric acid (0 ppm). An exponential apodization function
corresponding to a line broadening of 100 Hz was applied before Fourier
transformation.

Proton-decoupled 15N cross-polarization
(CP) spectra
of static aligned samples were acquired at 50.67 MHz on a Bruker Avance
wide-bore NMR spectrometer operating at 11.7 T (Bruker, Rheinstetten,
Germany). A commercial E-free triple-resonance solid-state NMR probe
equipped with a flat coil56 was used (Bruker,
Rheinstetten, Germany). The adiabatic passage through the Hartman-Hahn
CP condition (APHH-CP) pulse sequence57 was used with the typical parameters: spectral width 35.7 kHz, acquisition
time 14.4 ms, and CP contact time 600 μs. The 1H
B1 field was swept from 40 to 60% following a tangent amplitude-modulated
slope, and the average value corresponded to 47.6 kHz. About 60 000
scans were accumulated with 1024 points. An exponential apodization
function corresponding to a line broadening of 300 Hz was applied
before Fourier transformation. Spectra were externally referenced
to 15NH4Cl at 41 ppm.58

2H solid-state NMR spectra were recorded using
a quadrupolar
echo pulse sequence59 with the typical
parameters: 2H B1 field 40.3 kHz, echo delay
40 μs, spectral width 500 kHz, 16 000 data points, about
120 000 scans, and repetition time 1.5 s. The spectra were
referenced relative to 2H2O (0 ppm). The FID
was transformed beginning at the exact top of the echo. An exponential
apodization function corresponding to a line broadening of 100 Hz
was applied before Fourier transformation.

Calculation of Orientational
Constrains Obtained from ssNMR
Data
To evaluate APP_TM4K orientations that agree with the
experimental results, the static 15N chemical shift tensor
was oriented with respect to the molecular coordinate system of the
polypeptide structure using an Euler algorithm as described before.3615N chemical shift main tensor elements
of 56, 81, and 223 ppm for alanine and valine and 40, 67, and 217
ppm for glycine, respectively, were used.60 To evaluate the peptide orientations that agree with the experimental
results of the 2H quadrupole interactions of the alanine
residue, a maximal quadrupolar coupling constant of 74 kHz was used
for the alanine 2H3C-group.61
