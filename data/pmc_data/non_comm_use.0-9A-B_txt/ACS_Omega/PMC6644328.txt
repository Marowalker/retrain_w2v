SAPO-34
zeolite crystals were grown on zeolite 5A beads, characterized,
and then used to produce furfural from xylose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) from glucose. The SAPO-34/5A bead catalysts resulted in moderate
furfural and HMF yields of 45% from xylose and 20% from glucose (463
K; 3 h) and were easier to recover than the SAPO-34 powder catalyst.
At 463 K, the SAPO-34/5A beads were more selective than 0.02 M sulfuric
acid for producing HMF and, unlike the sulfuric acid system, no levulinic
acid was formed. The SAPO-34/5A bead catalysts had no significant
loss in activity after three rounds of recycle when water washed or
heated overnight between reactions; however, the heat-treated beads
did show signs of thermal stress after the second reuse. The SAPO-34/5A
bead catalysts show promise for dehydration reactions to produce furfural
and HMF from xylose and glucose, respectively, and tailoring the catalyst
and the support bead could lead to even higher selectivities and yields.

1 Introduction
Increasing energy demands
have motivated research for alternative
forms of energy and chemicals derived from non-petroleum sources.
Biofuels derived from biomass are recognized as viable alternative
energy sources, and the production of bio-based platform chemicals
is an area of significant interest. Versatile chemical intermediates,
such as furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and levulinic acid
(LA), can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, and any of the
aforementioned can deliver a variety of fuels and chemical commodities.1 For example, furfural, identified as one of the
top 12 value-added chemicals from biomass by the DOE,2 has useful applications as a building block for carbon-rich
C10–C15 fuel additives and can be upgraded
for incorporation into biofuels, which is achieved through hydrogenation,
rearrangement, and carbon–carbon coupling.3,4 HMF
is a precursor for 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid, another top 12 value-added
chemical,2 and can be upgraded for many
chemical applications.5,6

Existing pathways for furfural
and HMF production from lignocellulose
are typically energy-intensive and result in only moderate yields.3 Significant research has been dedicated to producing
furfural and HMF using homogeneous acid catalysts such as sulfuric
acid and hydrochloric acid;3,7−9 however, homogeneous acids are corrosive, require special handling,
and can have negative effects on downstream catalytic processes. Heterogeneous
catalysts are an attractive alternative to homogeneous acids, and
many researchers have looked at biomass and sugar conversion to furans
and other products, including LA.10−13

Different classes of solid
acid catalysts have been demonstrated
as effective catalysts for both furfural and HMF production, including
ion exchange resins, metal oxides, and carbon-based catalysts.14−19 Of particular interest are zeolites, which are known for their chemical
and thermal stability, versatility,20 and
wide range of pore sizes (0.2 nm to over 1.0 nm21) that are available. Zeolites have been widely used in
biomass conversion.22−26 For example, research by Gao et al. found that xylose dehydration
reactions with ZSM-5 resulted in furfural yields of 51.5% in an aqueous
system25 and Ordomsky et al. used MOR,
H-ZSM-5, and H-BEA to convert fructose to HMF with selectivities ranging
from 30 to 68% at around 80% conversion (165 °C) in an MIBK/H2O biphasic system. The high HMF selectivity found with MOR
was attributed to its high acid site strength compared to other zeolites
tested.26 Other researchers have looked
at the use of powdered silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs), a class of
small-pore zeolites, in various solvent systems to maximize furfural
production from xylose, achieving moderate yields.24 For dehydration reactions that are typically favored at
higher temperatures, SAPOs are particularly favorable because of their
hydrothermal stability, up to 873 K under steam conditions.27 Additionally, small-pore zeolites have high
versatility because of being able to control the physicochemical functionalities
such as acidity and hydrophobic–hydrophilic nature.28 SAPOs with different acidities, pore sizes,
and silica to alumina ratios have been used for furfural synthesis
in biphasic systems, achieving yields of up to 63% furfural.29,30 Other research has shown promising results on powdered
catalysts as well.24,31,32

Despite the general promise of microporous zeolites for sugar
dehydration,
prior demonstrations have typically been performed with powdered catalysts
having average particle sizes on the micron scale. Unfortunately,
these materials are impractical for utilization in industrial flow
reactors because of excessive pressure drop and potential for entrainment.
For heterogeneously catalyzed sugar dehydration to be feasible industrially,
it is important to demonstrate that sugar dehydrations can be performed
on macroscale catalysts, which have additional challenges relative
to powdered catalysts. Most significantly in the system of interest
here, the small zeolite pore size can create a diffusion-limited system.
This is particularly true for substrates like sugars, which have large
kinetic diameters. Powdered catalysts are able to mitigate this to
some extent as their small particle sizes ensure that the bulk of
catalytic active sites remain in relatively close proximity to the
external particle surface, that is, they have a short diffusion path.
In contrast, pelletized catalysts have large particle sizes and diffusion
lengths such that mass transfer limitations are generally severe.
Often, the small fraction of catalytic active sites at or near the
external surface of the pellet participate in the reaction, while
the vast majority of the active sites within the interior of the pellet
are inaccessible and thus underutilized.

Hybrid, composite materials
offer a potential resolution. Specifically,
by depositing a micron-scale layer of the catalyst onto the exterior
surface of a macrostructure, all of the active sites remain concentrated
in the first few microns of the bead diameter. Thus, the short diffusion
path of a powdered catalyst is maintained in an industrially relevant
material. Despite their promise, active layers of zeolites grown on
a bead support remain an unexplored area of solid acid catalyst use,
particularly for furan production. In addition to the aforementioned
concerns over diffusion limitations, catalysts will typically undergo
some form of deactivation during application and thus be subjected
to periodic regeneration. Normally, this occurs through thermal cycling
in air (calcination) to oxidize surface carbon and regenerate catalytic
active sites. It is critical that industrial catalysts retain their
macrostructure through repeated catalyst regeneration cycles, and
the thermal stability of composite bead catalysts has not been well
established.

In this work, we show that novel SAPO-34/5A bead
catalysts can
be used for the dehydration of xylose and glucose to furans in aqueous
systems, exploring the possible diffusion limitations and catalyst
recyclability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
Figure 1 shows representative
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of a single composite catalyst
bead composed of a SAPO-34 layer grown on zeolite 5A. Figure 1a shows the coverage of SAPO-34
crystals, and Figure 1b shows the thickness of the SAPO-34 layer that grew on the surface
of the 5A beads, which averaged in the 25–50 μm range.
The surface area of the SAPO-34/5A beads was 454 m2 g–1 compared to 520 m2 g–1 for the synthesized SAPO-34 powder and 387 m2 g–1 for the 5A beads (Table 1). Additionally, the SAPO-34/5A and 5A beads had significantly
less micropore area than the powder, 83 and 86% micropore area,
respectively, compared to 100% micropore area that the SAPO-34 powder
had. As with the micropore area, the number of acid sites on the bead
catalysts was lower than the powders, and in the case of the commercially
prepared SAPO-34 (SAPO-34C), the number of acid sites was an order
of magnitude higher (Table 1).

Figure 2a shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of (i) pure 5A beads, (ii) SAPO-34/5A
beads, and (iii) SAPO-34 crystals collected from the autoclave after
synthesis of SAPO-34/5A beads. Figure 2i agrees with the known structure of zeolite 5A, which
crystallizes in the LTA topology,33 and
after the incorporation of SAPO-34, the XRD pattern of 5A beads is
preserved (Figure 2ii). The XRD peak of SAPO-34 (Figure 2iii) overlaps with the XRD peak of the SAPO-34/5A beads
(Figure 2ii) at 2θ
≈ 16°, suggesting the incorporation of SAPO-34 on the
surface of 5A beads. Also, it was evident from these XRD patterns
that the peaks shift slightly for some of these diffraction peaks.
The XRD pattern of the crystals collected in the bottom of the autoclave
after synthesis (Figure 2iii) corresponded to the CHA topology characteristic of SAPO-34.34 The crystal size of SAPO-34 powders collected
from the autoclave after synthesis of SAPO-34/5A beads was approximately
1–5 μm (Figure 2b).

2.2 Xylose
Reactions
After 6 h at 423
K, all of the catalysts evaluated dehydrated xylose to furfural to
some extent. The SAPO-34/5A beads and 0.02 M H2SO4 had the highest furfural yields of 16 and 23%, respectively, and
the other catalysts had yields less than 10% and were not significantly
different than the system that had no catalyst present (7%; Table 2). This was an unexpected
result because both SAPO-34 powders had substantially higher acid
site densities than the SAPO-34/5A beads (Table 1); therefore, the powdered catalysts would
be expected to be more active and result in higher yields at a given
time. However, it is important to note that it is impossible to know
how many active sites are accessible to the large sugar molecules
and therefore, turn-over frequency may not be representative of the
actual activity of the catalyst. The average pore diameter of SAPO-34
is in the range of 0.38 nm,35 which is
smaller than the kinetic diameter of xylose (0.68 nm36,37); accordingly, xylose dehydration over the powdered SAPO catalyst
is likely to be diffusion-limited. This may explain why the powdered
SAPO-34 catalysts show little more than background activity at 423
K. However, the SAPO-34/5A beads had twice the furfural yield than
the background activity which may be explained by the higher mesoporosity,
whereas both SAPO-34 powders were entirely microporous materials (Table 1). For diffusion-limited
systems, it stands to reason that introducing mesoporosity into the
SAPO-34 structure would substantially improve catalyst activity by
facilitating access to interior Brønsted sites. Similar results
have been observed previously with modified H-USY zeolites as reported
by Pande et al.38

a Reaction conditions: 2 wt % xylose,
4 mL H2O, and 0.02 M H2SO4 or 0.048
g of catalyst. Experimental error is ±4%, based on multiple trials
of reactions marked with an asterisk.

Increasing the temperature to 443 K significantly
increased the
furfural yields for all systems (Figure 3). The SAPO-34/5A bead catalyst had a significantly
lower furfural yield (32%) than 0.02 M H2SO4 (51%) at similar conversions and was within error of the SAPO-34
(34%) and SAPO-34C (27%) powder catalysts (Table 2). Because the powder and the bead yields
were similar, the increased mesoporosity of the beads did not seem
to affect the reaction at 443 K as much as it may have at 423 K. Further
increasing reaction temperature to 463 K led to the highest furfural
yield with the SAPO-34/5A beads which was 45% at 95% xylose conversion
(Table 2). The furfural
selectivities of the SAPO-34 catalysts were in the range of 46–54%,
which was at least double that of the 5A beads (21%). The 5A beads
had similar Brønsted acidity and micropore area fraction (Table 1) as the SAPO-34/5A
bead catalysts, but resulted in significantly lower furfural yields
at all temperatures evaluated. One difference between zeolite 5A and
SAPO-34 is the framework structure. The 5A zeolites have an LTA framework
with a pore size of 0.41 nm and interior cages that can include molecules
up to 1.1 nm, while SAPO-34 has a CHA framework with 0.38 nm pores
and cages that can include molecules up to 0.74 nm.21 This may affect the product selectivity39 because furfural degradation generally occurs through condensation,3 which may be more facile in the more open cages
of LTA.

463 K (3 h for all except H2SO4 at 2 h; black).
Reaction conditions: 2 wt % xylose, 4 mL H2O, and 0.02
M H2SO4 or 0.048 g of catalyst.

The effect the catalysts had on the reaction kinetics
was more
evident when conversion was compared with time at 443 K (Figure 4). The xylose conversion
of all catalysts systems was at least double that of the no catalyst
system at a given time, excluding the SAPO-34C powder. With the exception
of 5A beads, for which furfural selectivities range from 15 to 20%,
the heterogeneous catalysts had furfural selectivities generally in
the 30–55% range over the reaction times presented (Table 2), which resulted
in furfural yields of approximately half of the xylose conversion
(Figure 5). The SAPO-34/5A
bead and SAPO-34 powder catalysts showed similar kinetic trends to
the 0.02 M H2SO4 system where the furfural yield
increased through 8 h and then the yield decreased at 24 h (not shown).
For these systems, the xylose conversion was above 80% at 8 h, and
the decrease in furfural yield at 24 h was likely due to degradation
reactions, which lead to formation of humins and other by-products.
The 5A bead catalyst had the highest xylose conversion at a given
time, but had the lowest furfural yields. The increased activity of
the 5A bead catalyst relative to all other systems may have several
causes. First, the slightly larger pore size and increased mesoporosity
(Table 1) of the 5A
catalyst may decrease mass transfer resistance relative to the SAPO-34
based systems. In addition, after reaction, the 5A beads showed signs
of partial and sometimes complete disintegration. Because the 5A beads
were held together using a binder and not composed of a single crystal,
partial dissolution of the bead may have created a suspension of fine
LTA particles in solution, which would, generally, increase access
to active sites relative to intact beads.

2.3 Recyclability
The retention of the
SAPO-34/5A bead structure in multiple use recycle reactions is critical
to the demonstration of the feasibility of the composite catalysts.
Recyclability experiments were performed after catalyst regeneration
by (1) only washing catalysts with water and (2) not washing the catalyst
and only heating it overnight at 523 K. The catalysts showed good
performance after three times recycling with the water washing (Figure 6; gray bars) and
overnight heating led to a slight increase in furfural yield during
the third reuse compared to the nonheated sample (Figure 6; black bars). The decrease
in catalyst activity seen for SAPO-34/5A with the second water washing
was within experimental error but may be attributed to the blocking
of acid sites from surface deposition of carbonaceous species. Similar
conclusions have been previously reported for SAPO-34 in other research
studies.24,40 Suprun et al. hypothesized that the relatively
high acidity and small pores of SAPO-34 are both factors that lead
to accumulation of carbonaceous deposits blocking its surface.40 The overnight heating process could remove some
of these species, regenerating more acid sites than with just water
washing thus, maintaining activity.

Figure 6 Furfural yields from recycle reactions
with SAPO-34/5A with water
washes (gray bars) and heating (black bars) between runs. Reaction
conditions: 2 wt % xylose, 443 K, 6 h.

The water-washed beads maintained their structure and after
the
third reuse, the beads still had a spherical shape with no significant
mass loss; however, after the second reuse, several of the heat regenerated
SAPO-34/5A beads had cracked, resulting in nonspherical beads with
approximately 38% mass loss (Figure 7a). This damage likely occurred because of thermal
stressing since the water-washed beads did not show signs of cracking.
In a third reuse, the heat-regenerated SAPO-34/5A beads still showed
good activity, and the SAPO-34 layer remained intact and was a similar
thickness (Figure 7b) to the starting beads (Figure 1b).

and
two reactions and (b) cross-section of a representative bead after
two heat treatments and three reactions.

2.4 Glucose Reactions
Starting with glucose
led to a moderate amount of HMF formed at 443 K (6 h) and 463 K (3
h) for all heterogeneous catalysts tested (Figure 8). The SAPO-34/5A bead catalyst resulted
in the highest HMF yield (20%) with no detectable amount of LA formed,
while the SAPO-34C and SAPO-34 powders had HMF yields within the experimental
error (19 and 18%, respectively). The reaction solutions from all
SAPO-34 catalysts also had fructose peaks present after reaction,
indicating that the acid sites isomerized the glucose to fructose,
whereas no fructose peak was present for the H2SO4 system. Although the yields with the SAPO catalysts were low to
moderate, it is worth noting that they were obtained directly from
glucose in an aqueous phase, which is a notoriously difficult reaction
for selectivity control. Further, these SAPO-34-based catalysts perform
comparably to other zeolites when they are tested under similar conditions.23 Particularly compelling was the observation
that SAPO-34-based materials did not appear to catalyze the hydration
of HMF to form LA, whereas H2SO4 was primarily
selective to LA and the no catalyst system at 463 K did have some
LA present (Figure 8). The focus of this study was to probe the activity, stability,
and recyclability of these hybrid materials for sugar dehydration,
so we do not have a definitive explanation for this enhanced selectivity;
however, we speculate that the microporous material appears to be
beneficial to selectivity. That said, these observations suggest that
SAPO-34 may be a platform for rational design of solid catalysts that
offer improved HMF selectivity relative to conventionally employed
mineral acids.

Reaction
conditions: 2 wt % glucose, 4 mL H2O, 0.02 M H2SO4 or 0.048 g of catalyst, 443 K (gray bars) reactions
for 6 h, and 463 K (black bars) reactions for 3 h.

3 Conclusions
We have
demonstrated for the first-time the synthesis of zeolite
bead catalysts consisting of SAPO-34 zeolite grown on zeolite 5A beads
and their ability to convert sugars to furans in an aqueous system
with significantly higher HMF selectivities than H2SO4 systems and no LA formation. The SAPO-34/5A beads heterogeneously
catalyzed dehydration reactions and resulted in moderate yields of
furfural from xylose and HMF from glucose. The bead structure made
recovery and reuse of the catalysts significantly easier and the structure
was not affected by water washes. The catalysts were able to be recycled
three times for xylose reactions with only a slight decrease in the
furfural yield. We believe that the rational design of these new catalysts
for biomass upgrading could successfully lead to the production of
platform chemicals from biomass.

4 Methods
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
The SAPO-34
synthesis gel had a molar composition of 1.0 Al2O3:1.0 P2O5:0.3 SiO2:1.0 tetraethylammonium
hydroxide (TEAOH):1.6 dipropylamine (DPA):300 H2O, similar
to that reported elsewhere.41 To prepare
the gel, aluminum isopropoxide [Al(i-C3H7O)3, Sigma-Aldrich 98% (all U.S. suppliers)] and deionized water
were stirred for 1 h to form a homogeneous solution. Then, phosphoric
acid (H3PO4, Sigma-Aldrich 85 wt % aqueous solution)
was added to the aluminum solution for another 2 h under stirring.
Ludox AS-40 colloidal silica was added (Sigma-Aldrich, 40 wt % suspension
in water) and the resulting solution was stirred for another 3 h.
Finally, TEAOH (35 wt % in water, Sigma-Aldrich) and DPA (Acros 99%)
were added. The final gel was stirred at ∼323 K for 4 days.
The resultant solution was transferred into a 45 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel
autoclave containing 5 g of pure zeolite 5A beads. Zeolite 5A beads
were selected because of their chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability.33,42 Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out in a conventional oven at
503 K for 6 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature
using a cold water bath, the SAPO-34-covered 5A beads were taken out
from the autoclave, washed with deionized water, and dried at 373
K overnight. To remove the templates, the SAPO-34/5A beads were calcined
using an oven at 673 K for 4 h with heating and cooling rates of 0.8
K/min.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
The synthesized
SAPO-34/5A beads were inspected by XRD using a Siemens Kristalloflex
810 diffractometer operating at 30 kV and 25 mA with Cu Kα1
radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å). The morphology of the samples
was inspected by SEM model JEOL JSM-7000F.

Specific surface
areas were determined from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis
of N2 physisorption isotherms at 77 K. t-Plot analysis of the same isotherms was used to determine the micropore
area for each sample. N2 uptake isotherms were obtained
using Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Each experiment used roughly 75 mg
of catalyst, and all samples were outgassed under vacuum at 623 K
for 4 h prior to N2 dosing.

Brønsted site densities
were determined from molar quantities
of ethylene evolved between 470 and 870 K during temperature-programmed
desorption of ethylamine.15 Approximately
70 mg of catalyst was loaded into a quartz tube (1/2″) on top
of a quartz wool plug, and the tube was positioned in a high-temperature
furnace (Omega) and connected to a gas flow manifold. Prior to analysis,
catalysts were calcined in situ at 673 K for 4 h under 50 mL min–1 of air (Airgas, Ultra Zero). Subsequently, samples
were cooled to 423 K and purged with 100 mL min–1 of He that was dried over molecular sieves. After pretreatment,
the samples were held at 423 K and contacted with ethylamine (99%,
Sigma). Ethylamine was introduced into the He stream (60 mL min–1) by vaporization of liquid ethylamine through a 50
μm capillary tube. The point of ethylamine surface saturation
was determined by monitoring the off-gas with a mass selective residual
gas analyzer (Stanford Instruments RGA 100). After ethylamine saturation,
the cell was purged with He (423 K, 400 mL min–1) for 1 h and subsequently ramped to 973 K (10 K min–1). The sweep gas for this experiment contained 1.0 mol % Ar, which
was used as an internal standard to facilitate quantitative analysis.
During the temperature ramp, the cell effluent was monitored using
a mass selective residual gas analyzer (Stanford Instruments RGA 100).
Signals corresponding to ethylamine (m/z = 30), ethylene (m/z = 27), and
Ar (m/z = 40) were monitored continuously.
Brønsted site densities were calculated from evolved ethylene
based on the assumption that one molecule of ethylene forms at one
accessible Brønsted site.

4.3 Catalytic
Reactions
Reactions were
performed in 15 mL pressure tube reactors with magnetic stirring.
Reactors were heated in a silicone oil bath held at the reaction temperature
by a heated stir plate. For a typical reaction, 2 wt % xylose (Sigma-Aldrich,
X1500) or glucose (Fisher Scientific, D16-500), 4 mL H2O, and the catalyst were added to the reactors with a stir bar and
sealed. SAPO-34 powder was purchased commercially (ACS Material) and
used as received. To differentiate between the SAPO-34 powder that
was synthesized (SAPO-34 powder) and the commercial SAPO-34 (SAPO-34C),
a “C” will be used for the commercial SAPO-34 powder.
The heterogeneous catalysts were stored in a 403 K oven overnight
to remove water prior to reaction. Either 0.02 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or 0.048 g of catalyst was added to the pressure
tube, and the sealed pressure tubes were placed in the heated oil
bath. The mass of the heterogeneous catalyst was the same for both
the powder and bead catalysts. After the reaction, external airflow
was used to cool the reactors to room temperature. Products were analyzed
by high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1100, Bio-Rad Aminex
HPX-87H column, trifluroacetic acid mobile phase) with a refractive
index detector and diode array detector.

For the recyclability
experiments, two methods were used to regenerate the SAPO-34/5A bead
catalysts. A fresh catalyst was used in 6 h xylose reactions that
were run as described previously, and for both methods, the catalysts
were recovered after reaction using tweezers. For the first method,
the recovered catalyst was washed with water five times and then used
for a 6 h xylose reaction and the process was repeated. For the second
method, no washing occurred, but the catalyst was placed in a 523
K oven overnight. The regenerated catalysts were then used again for
a 6 h xylose reaction as described above.
