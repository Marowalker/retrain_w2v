Many proteins are synthesized as
precursors, with propeptides playing
a variety of roles such as assisting in folding or preventing them
from being active within the cell. While the precise role of the propeptide
in fungal lipases is not completely understood, it was previously
reported that mutations in the propeptide region of the Rhizomucor miehei lipase have an influence on the
activity of the mature enzyme, stressing the importance of the amino
acid composition of this region. We here report two structures of
this enzyme in complex with its propeptide, which suggests that the
latter plays a role in the correct maturation of the enzyme. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that the propeptide shows inhibition of
lipase activity in standard lipase assays and propose that an important
role of the propeptide is to ensure that the enzyme is not active
during its expression pathway in the original host.

==== Body
Introduction
The lipase from the
fungus Rhizomucor miehei (henceforth,
RmL refers to the mature enzyme, while ProRmL refers
to the proenzyme) belongs to the family of triglyceride
lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) called class 3 lipases (PF01764 in Pfam, https://pfam.xfam.org),1 which are members of the α/β hydrolase
superfamily (53474 in SCOP, http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/)2 that hydrolyze the ester linkages of
triglycerides. Class 3 lipases are found in animals, plants, protists,
and prokaryotes and are only distantly related to other lipase families.
Their active sites were shown to contain a classical catalytic triad
composed of Ser-His-Asp,3 but in contrast
to serine protease, the active sites are buried inside the structure.
Subsequent structural studies revealed that there were two forms of
RmL and related class 3 lipases: a closed inactive form that prevented
access of the substrate to the active site and an open active form. The
closed form is converted to the open conformation by the movement
of a lid containing a short α-helix.4

Class 3 lipases, similar to a number of other proteins, contain
an “additional” region during folding, which is subsequently
cleaved either by autoprocessing, as is the case for several proteases,
or by external proteases. These regions, termed propeptides, are often
referred to as intramolecular chaperones (see ref (5) and references therein)
and, as such, are required for proper folding and activity of the
mature protein. Such an intramolecular chaperone was first described
for subtilisin,6 but they are found in
various classes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, as reviewed
in refs (7−9). X-ray structures have been determined
for a number of propeptides containing proteins, particularly the
proteases, as reviewed in ref (10).

The presence of a lipase propeptide was first reported
for the
enzyme from the fungus R. miehei,11 where analysis of a complementary DNA library
constructed in Escherichia coli revealed
that the initial gene product is made up of domains corresponding
to a 29-amino acid residue signal peptide, 65-residue N-terminal propeptide,
and 269-residue mature enzyme (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Components of pre-ProRmL (UniProt P19515,
PMID:
3419283) starting from residue 1 of the signal peptide. This residue
numbering is used throughout the present communication; the original
papers reporting the crystal structures of mature RmL3,12 number this catalytic domain from 1 to 269, and thus, 94 needs to
be added to those residue numbers when comparing them with those used
here.

While conventional prediction
of the signal peptide length using
the Signal 4.1 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/),13 suggests cleavage occurs after residue
24; it appears that the final cleavage occurs after residue 29 in
the pre-ProRmL by a specific peptidase, KexB, which
is an Aspergillus oryzae ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kex214 that cleaves after KR (or RR) sequence motif during secretion
in the Golgi.15,16 Therefore, in our case, with
the lipase being expressed in A. oryzae, as described below, the propeptide starts from residue 30.

Early structural studies were undertaken on a Rhizopus
oryzae (previously Rhizopus delemar) lipase with the aim of elucidating the propeptide function, but
only the structure of the mature enzyme was reported12 (PDB ID: 1TIC). Subsequently,
there have been reports on the influence of mutations in the propeptide
region on the enzyme activity of RmL17,18 and on another
class 3 lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus, TLL;19 however, there is no information
available on the structure of the proenzyme or on the inhibitory effect
of the propeptide. Bearing in mind the increasing body of evidence
showing that mutations in the propeptide region can influence protein
activity,17,18 structural information on lipase propeptides
is of interest for gaining a better understanding of the function
of the class 3 lipases, will add to the growing body of propeptide
information, and finally would be potentially applicable in improving
the properties for industrially important processes.

The structure
of mature RmL in the closed form was determined over
25 years ago.3 Structures are now available
for both the inactive, lid-closed and active, lid-open conformations4 but were all restricted to the mature enzyme
domain. We here report the first structures of RmL expressed in Aspergillus with its propeptide bound, derived from both
a construct corresponding to the full-length proenzyme, that is residues
30–363 (the prolipase composed of the mature enzyme and propeptide
domains), and a variant (henceforth, ProRmL-del)
of this proenzyme with two residues, 95 and 96, deleted. These structures
suggest that one function of the propeptide is to bury the active
site and binding area for the substrate before maturation. In addition,
kinetics experiments are reported, which demonstrate the inhibitory
effect of the propeptide when bound to the mature enzyme and allow
us to propose a role for this inhibition in the natural host.

Results
and Discussion
Isolation of the Prolipase, Mature RmL, Propeptide,
and Deletion
Variant
Constructs were cloned and expressed as described
in the Experimental Section. The identity
of each of the samples was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Table 1). For the propeptide
and ProRmL-del, the measured values in the table
have been corrected for the masses of expected posttranslational modifications.1. N-acetylglucosamine
at N-glycosylation site after EndoH deglycosylation
(cleaved propeptide and ProRmL-del).

2. Hexose at O-glycosylation site (cleaved
propeptide and ProRmL-del).

3. Pyroglutamic acid at N-terminal Gln(Q)
(cleaved propeptide and ProRmL-del).

Thus, purified samples were
obtained for the following:1. RmL, the mature wild-type enzyme without
propeptide, residues 95–363.

2. ProRmL, the wild-type
prolipase, residues 30–363 (observed residues 95–363).
This suggests that the propeptide has been cleaved from the mature
enzyme and that this is a noncovalent complex of the propeptide bound
to the mature enzyme.

3. Cleaved propeptide, separated from
the mature enzyme, residues 30–94.

4. ProRmL-del, the prolipase,
residues 30–363 with residues 95–96 deleted.



Overall Fold
The structure of mature
RmL was already
known in its open and closed forms, and the closed form was used to
solve crystal structures corresponding to the wild-type ProRmL and the ProRmL-del mutant samples by molecular
replacement.

Wild-Type ProRmL Sample
The structure
derived from the full-length wild-type ProRmL sample
was determined by molecular replacement using the closed form of the
mature enzyme (PDB ID: 3TGL) as the search
model. The final model is composed of residues 37–87 of the
propeptide with a loop of residues 50–54 being disordered and
with another missing region (88–97) with no electron density
between the propeptide and the beginning of the mature enzyme. The
density for the mature enzyme region starts at Gly98 and continues
with no gaps until the C-terminal Thr363 (equivalent to residues 4–269
in the previously published mature RmL structures). The structure
of the ProRmL-del below had a smaller missing region,
and hence, the discussion will focus on that structure. It is important
to point out that the structure for the ProRmL-del
sample is very similar to that derived from the wild-type ProRmL sample, indicating that the double mutation did not
cause any significant changes to the overall fold.

The ProRmL-del Variant
The final model
comprises residues 37–88 of the propeptide and 98–363
of the mature enzyme and is shown in Figure 2, superposed on the open and closed forms
of the mature enzyme. It is immediately clear that the mature enzyme
domain in the propeptide complex is in an essentially identical conformation
to that in the closed form of the mature RmL (PDB ID: 3TGL), with an r.m.s. deviation over 264 equivalent
Cα positions of 0.4 Å.

Figure 2 Overall structure of ProRmL-del. (a) Superposition
of the structure of ProRmL-del (ice blue) on the
mature RmL in its closed form (coral; PDB ID: 3TGL) and open form
(gold; PDB ID: 4TGL). The single GlcNAc glycosylation site (Asn297)
is shown in Glycoblock format.20 The catalytic
triad (Ser238, Asp297, and His351) is shown as spheres colored by
the atom type. The distance between Asp88 and Gly98 is 24 Å.
(b) Surface of ProRmL-del, with the mature protein
colored according to its electrostatic charge with transparency to
reveal the buried catalytic triad (spheres), and the ordered propeptide
Ser37-Asp88 in ice blue. The N-terminal residue of mature RmL, Gly98,
is shown as spheres.

As expected, the novel feature in this structure is the presence
of the propeptide, which wraps around the surface of the mature enzyme
(Figure 2a,b). As stated
above, the sequence in the previous PDB depositions was numbered from
the first amino acid of the mature enzyme, while in the present structure,
the numbering starts from the beginning of the signal peptide. This
avoids negative residue numbers and means that the residue numbers
here correspond directly to the UniProt entry P19515.

There
was well-defined electron density for the RmL propeptide
residues 37–88 that revealed the structure of the propeptide
for the first time, with no electron density for the first seven residues
of the propeptide, which are assumed to be disordered. Residues 89–97
leading up to the first residue of the mature enzyme are also absent
in the electron density map, implying that they are either cleaved
despite all efforts to keep it intact or very flexible. It is not
possible to state with confidence which of these two scenarios is
true. Starting from Ser37, the propeptide wraps around the enzyme
as an extended chain, leading up to a more compact segment making
contacts with the lid of the mature enzyme (residues 178–186)
through a number of interactions (Figure 2 and Table S1).
The catalytic triad comprising the active site is seen to be buried
below the compact domain of the propeptide (Figure 2). The propeptide packs against the α-helix
which switches between open and closed conformations of the enzyme,
maintaining the helix in the closed inactive position. The interactions
of the propeptide with the lid will be discussed in more detail below.

The distance between the C-terminal ends of the ordered region
of the propeptide, Asp88, and the first residue, Gly98, corresponding
to the mature enzyme Gly4 is ∼24 Å. Before setting up
the crystallization, the integrity of the ProRmL-del
sample was established from an SDS gel of the liquid in the drop containing
crystals. Unfortunately, the crystals themselves have too small a
volume to extract the protein and run the SDS gels or carry out mass
spectrometric analysis. As stated above, it is therefore not clear
whether residues 89–97 are disordered in the crystal or if
this peptide has been cleaved during the crystal growth or, indeed,
whether the cleaved protein has been selectively crystallized. It
is also possible that a single cut has been made between residues
97 and 98 and that this has caused residues 89–97 to be disordered.
The density around residues 88 and 97 is shown in Figure 3. A computer model of the full-length
RmL propeptide was built using the X-ray structure of ProRmL with the program Nest21 from the Jackal
1.5 suite from Honig’s group (Figure 3b) and clearly shows that the missing 10
residues can nicely span the gap between Asp88 and Gly98.

defined with high B values.

Binding of Propeptide to Mature RmL Leads to Inhibition of Activity
The RmL propeptide was separated from the ProRmL
sample. The isolated propeptide showed clear inhibition of activity
in the GLAD lipase assay (an activity assay used for industrial applications
that normally uses a high detergent level and hence required a high
ratio of propeptide to mature RmL; public patent number: WO2016184944
(A1)) (Figure 4a).
A propeptide fragment covering the lid-clip and hydrophobic anchor
residues in the structure was found to interact quite strongly with
the mature RmL in an aqueous binding assay. The independent measurement
of the interaction between the propeptide and RmL gave an affinity
(Kd) of 0.2 μM (Figure 4b). In the ProRmL, the molar ratio is 1:1; thus, the measured low Kd of peptide binding bridges the inhibition study to the
observations where neither ProRmL nor ProRmL-del shows a lipase activity in the zymogram area of the prominent
bands representing the propeptide complex (see the Experimental Section, Figure 8).

Figure 4 (a) Lipase activity assay after incubation of the mature
RmL (left)
without and (right) with addition of excess molar ratio of the purified
propeptide. (b) Binding of the propeptide fragment to mature RmL,
measured as a decrease in fluorescence polarization of the labeled
peptide upon increasing concentration of RmL.

We propose that the role of the propeptide is to ensure that
there
is no lipase activity during the expression pathway of the enzyme
in the original host and that the enzyme only matures and becomes
active late in the secretion pathway. Sequence alignment of a selected
set of fungal lipases with similarity to RmL reveals a similarity
in the propeptide region, indicating a general phenomenon of inhibition
of unwanted activities during the expression of the lipase in the
host cell. These results clearly demonstrate the inhibitory effect
of the isolated propeptide and indicate the structural basis for the
inhibition and lower binding to the purification material. (Covering
of the hydrophobic anchor residue I250 and interaction with the lid
in the closed form of the enzyme.)

Protein–Propeptide
Interactions
The buried surface
area between the propeptide and the mature enzyme is ∼1771.2
Å2 (analyzed using PISA,23 corresponding to a strong protein–protein interaction).24 The most significant interactions between the
propeptide and mature enzyme from the PISA analysis are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). In summary,
there are 24 hydrogen bonds and five salt bridges, as well as hydrophobic
interactions not given in Table S1. One
of these interactions involves Leu81, which is one of the activity-related
mutations identified in ref (17) and is a part of the hydrophobic cluster at the entrance
to the active site, consisting of Ile183 from the lid and Val348.
The mutation L81V leads to an increased activity, possibly because
the contact between the mature enzyme and propeptide moiety is looser
due to valine’s smaller volume. (Several other activity-related
substitutions reported by Wang and colleagues lie in the disordered
regions with no visible electron density, so these cannot be interpreted
structurally.17,18) The main chain oxygen of Leu81
forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain nitrogen of Val348, which
further stabilizes the Leu-Val-Ile hydrophobic interaction holding
the lid closed. Other direct interactions with the lid region include
NZ of Lys76 to the main chain oxygens of Ala184 and Leu186 and OH
of Tyr77 to the main chain nitrogen of Phe188 (Table S1 and Figure 7).

In addition to the lid interaction, the propeptide
covers important hydrophobic regions of the mature lipase including
surface-exposed I298, F345, and V348 while introducing a mostly hydrophilic
surface. Residues forming hydrogen bonds inside and outside of the
lid region are shown in Figure 5, which is a sequence alignment for several selected RmL-like
lipases. There is only low sequence conservation for most of those,
apparently because the majority of hydrogen bonds are from main chain
atoms. However, Leu81 is conserved, with the corresponding residues
being Leu in all but one of the sequences where it is Phe and is also
hydrophobic. Another highly conserved proline-rich region is between
residues 39 and 45 of ProRmL, where the propeptide
wraps around the mature domain.

3 prolipase sequences

The RmL-like sequences with a prepro sequence constitute lipases RmL
(P19515; PDB IDs: 6QPP/6QPR; R. miehei), RcL (A3FM73; PDB ID: 4L3W; Rhizopus chinensis), P61872 (RoL, R. oryzae), AgL (A0A163J4P9, Absidia glauca), and PbL (A0A167LKQ2, Phycomyces blakesleeanus). The red box indicates
the regions that are in contact with the lid of the mature enzyme
domains (lid-clip) in the ProRmL and ProRcL X-ray structures. The residues of the propeptide that form hydrogen
bonds or salt bridges with the mature domain are indicated in red.
Leu81 in RmL (103 in RcL) that forms a hydrophobic interaction with
Ile from the lid of the mature domain is shown in blue. The SI residues
deleted in ProRmL-del to prevent fast cleavage of
the propeptide are outlined by the green box. The sequence alignment
was done using ClustalOmega.22

In summary, the RmL propeptide is in contact with
the lid and therefore
reduces the contact for the lid to the lipid surface and, thus, its
opening potential. This is supported by a structural similarity in
the lid-covering region with another fungal lipase, RcL, as discussed
below (Figure 7). The
inhibition is probably dependent on two additional effects: (1) burying
of one or more of the lipid-anchoring residues, that is, F345, V348,
L349, and I298 (see Figure 6) and (2) adding a more hydrophilic surface on the rim of
the lipase lid. Both potentially influence the penetration power of
the lipase into the lipid surface and thus avoid the opening of the
lid.

Figure 6 Surface representation of RmL and ProRmL illustrating
how the propeptide covers some of the hydrophobic residues in the
lipid contact zone area of the closed RmL. From left to right, closed
RmL, open RmL, and ProRmL. Top row: View from the
side with the lid on the top right. Bottom row: View into the lipid
contact zone. Hydrophobic anchor-like residues in the surface exposed
in the closed form are colored magenta (residue F345, V348, L349,
and I298 in ProRmL) or cyan. The only fully exposed
F307 in ProRmL (F213 in RmL) is colored cyan. All
other hydrophobic residues are colored white, hydrophilic residues
are yellow, positive residues are blue, and negative residues are
red.

Thus, the ProRmL structures show the propeptide
covering a part of the area of the lipase that interacts with the
lipid substrate surface (see Figure 6). A similar pattern is seen in the structure of a
lipase with the same overall αβ-hydrolase fold, namely,
that of the Gibberella zeae lipase
(PDB ID: 3NGM)25 with a C-terminal extension covering a part of the same region as
in ProRmL just next to the lid of the two homologous
lipases. The G. zeae enzyme belongs
to the same sequence family as RmL but differs in having a C-terminal
rather than an N-terminal propeptide attached. Interestingly, the
location of the propeptide in two independent X-ray structures shows
an interference of the two peptides in the same region of the functional
part of the lipase. In sequences closely related to RmL, a certain
promiscuity in activity can be seen, and for sequences closely related
to G. zeae, many phospholipase-acting
enzymes are seen.

Comparison to Lipase 4L3W: A Potential Propeptide
in Another
Lipase Structure
Analysis of the fungal lipase structures
in the PDB led to an interesting and unexpected result. While, as
discussed in the Introduction, no propeptide
structure has been reported for fungal lipases to date, the structure
of Rhizopus microsporus var. chinensis (RcL; PDB ID: 4L3W)
contained an unusual chain of ethylene glycol molecules. Examination
of the electron density maps from 4L3W in Coot revealed the presence
of a probable polypeptide chain in the region modeled as ethylene
glycols. We downloaded the coordinates, removed the chain of ethylene
glycols, and re-refined the structure by adding the propeptide residues
as described in the Experimental Section. This revealed a shorter visible propeptide than that from ProRmL but with a very similar conformation to ProRmL in the region 74–82 (96–104 in RcL) that covers
the active site (Figure 7), with the sequence identity in this region
being 50%. In particular, Leu81 (Leu103 in RcL) is conserved and forms
a hydrophobic interaction with Ile183 (Ile210 in RcL), which belongs
to the lid. Another hydrophobic residue in the vicinity of Leu81 (103)
+ Ile183 (210) is Val348 (Ile374 in RcL), which also has a hydrogen
bond by the main chain nitrogen to the main chain oxygen of Leu81
(103) from the propeptide. This is a key interaction holding the lid
in place and preventing its opening, and not surprisingly, Leu81 has
been reported as one of the mutations influencing the protein activity.17 The numbering for RcL is done in a way similar
to what we use for RmL, that is, starting from the first residue of
the signal peptide in the entry A3FM73.

of ProRmL-del
and our re-refined model derived from 4L3W. (A) Overall superposition.
The mature enzyme domains superimpose very well, and while propeptides
(red for ProRmL, green for 4L3W) have different conformations
overall, the regions adjacent to the lid have a striking similarity.
(B) Zoom-in on residues 73–83 (2–12 in 4L3W), showing
details of the interactions preventing the lid from opening and thus
protecting the binding site. Leu81 in ProRmL-del
(Leu103 in RcL) is involved in hydrophobic interactions with Ile183
(Ile210 in RcL) from the lid and is anchored to the main chain of
the binding site by the hydrogen bond between its main chain O and
N of Val348.

Conclusions
Samples
of mature R. miehei lipase,
its prolipase form, ProRmL, and cleaved propeptide
were prepared. 3D structures from the ProRmL samples
for both the wild-type form and a variant with two residues deleted
were determined using X-ray crystallography and revealed the structure
of most of the propeptides with a small disordered region between
the propeptide and mature enzyme domains. In the prolipase structure,
the mature domain is in the closed inactive form, and this is stabilized
by a region of the propeptide that sits on top of the active site,
preventing its opening. The remainder of the propeptide lies across
the surface of the enzyme. The inhibition of the mature lipase by
the propeptide when these two moieties are combined is demonstrated
and confirmed the key inhibitory role of the propeptide in preventing
the activation of the lipase during its expression. This is the first
structure of a class 3 prolipase. In addition, we have reinterpreted
the structure of a homologue from the PDB to suggest that it is also
a prolipase with a similar mode of inhibition of its activity by the
propeptide. We propose that the propeptide protects the cell in the
course of its expression pathway to secure no lipase activity or,
indeed, alternative activity such as phospholipase or glucolipid hydrolysis.

Experimental
Section
Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Wild-Type ProRmL
The gene for the wild-type ProRmL was
cloned and expressed in A. oryzae,
as described previously.11 The purification
strategy was as follows. In the first step, the fermentation broth
was applied to the hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)/affinity
column (decylamine that mimics a lipase substrate), and this procedure
separated the active lipase (mature RmL without propeptide) from the
inactive lipase (ProRmL including the propeptide).
After diafiltration, the inactive lipase was bound to an IEX column
from which it was eluted and characterized to further purify and concentrate
the sample. The active lipase was eluted from the HIC column and also
characterized. A final purification was carried out for the stabilized ProRmL, which was bound to a normal HIC column, since we
knew that it would not bind to the HIC/affinity column. It was eluted
and used for further experiments.

In more detail, the culture
supernatant from the A. oryzae broth
was first clarified by vacuum filtration using a combination of Seitz
filter and Whatman glass filter GF/F grade in a Buchner funnel followed
by sterile filtration using a Supor-200 0.2 μm filter on a vacuum
filtration unit. The clarified culture supernatant was diluted 1:1
with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7) + 2 M NaCl. The decylamine column (15 ×
200 mm; bed volume, 30 mL) was pre-equilibrated with wash buffer (50
mM HEPES (pH 7.0) + 1 M NaCl), and the sample was applied to the column
at a linear flow rate of 8 mL/min. ProRmL did not
bind to the column and was collected from flow-through fractions,
which were concentrated and then diafiltered against 50 mM HEPES (pH
7) buffer using a 10 kDa membrane in QuixStand TFF Unit. The final
volume after diafiltration was 300 mL (conductivity, 5 mS/cm). This
sample was directly loaded onto a UNO Q column (15 × 200 mm;
bed volume, 21 mL) pre-equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) at a
flow rate of 8 mL/min. Loosely bound impurities were removed by washing
the column with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) + 50 mM NaCl. The elution of ProRmL was carried out using 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1
M NaCl, and purified protein fractions were collected and pooled.

Isolation of Mature RmL
During the first step of the
purification described above, after the flow-through containing ProRmL was collected, the decylamine column was washed with
3 column volumes (CV) of buffer A (50 mM HEPES, (pH 7), 1 M NaCl),
and the mature RmL without propeptide was then eluted in a step gradient
of 3 CV 100% buffer B (Milli-Q water).

Native Gel and Parallel
Zymogram on Purified RmL Samples
In addition to SDS PAGE,
native PAGE followed by a zymogram was run
to demonstrate the loss of activity in the propeptide-containing sample
(Figure 8). The compositions for native PAGE were as follows.
Resolving gel: 12% acrylamide-bis-acrylamide; 0.4 M Tris (pH 8.8),
0.1% APS, 0.04% TEMED. Stacking gel: 5.1% acrylamide-bis-acrylamide;
0.25 M Tris (pH 6.8), 0.1% APS, 0.1% TEMED. Loading dye: 0.06 M Tris
(pH 6.8), 0.01% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol. Running buffer: 3
g/L Tris base, 14.4 g/L glycine. Gel (B) is stained with brilliant
blue. Zymogram: After electrophoresis, the native PAGE was placed
on an agarose/brilliant blue plate (4% Litex HSB agarose protein grade,
50 mM HEPES (pH 7), 0.625% polyvinyl alcohol, 1.9% (v/v) olive oil, and 0.05% brilliant green

PAGE on purified mature RmL, purified wild-type ProRmL, and purified ProRmL-del. (A) SDS PAGE shows
that mature RmL has a single strong band just above 31 kDa, and a
prominent band with a similar size is observed in purified wild-type ProRmL, whereas the prominent band in ProRmL-del is just below the 45 kDa marker. In contrast, (B) native
PAGE shows that wild-type ProRmL has the most prominent
band at a similar size as ProRmL-del and a much weaker
band at the size of mature RmL. (C) The zymogram based on the native
PAGE only shows the lipase activity at the band corresponding to mature
RmL, which is much stronger in mature RmL than in wild-type ProRmL and absent in ProRmL-del. Protein
markers: 6.5, 14.4, 21.5, 31, 45, 66.2, 97.4, 116.25, and 200 MW.

Separation of ProRmL from Mature RmL by Gel
Filtration
Two hundred microliters of the mixture of ProRmL and mature RmL was loaded on to a Superdex200 10/300
GL gel filtration column with a flow of 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase
was composed of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7) and 300 mM NaCl. The column was
calibrated with an LMW gel filtration calibration kit (product code
28-4038-41, GE Healthcare Europe GmbH, Park Allé 295, 2605
Brondby, Denmark), and a linear relationship between the retention
time and molecular weight was established according to the manual.
The retention time of mature RmL is 16.9 min, which corresponds to
a molecular weight of 27 kDa. The retention time of ProRmL is 15.9 min, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 42 kDa.
Thus ProRmL is probably predominantly a cleaved propeptide–mature
enzyme noncovalent complex (see SDS-PAGE (Figure 8) for the wild-type sample) but a covalent
single moiety for ProRmL-del. Samples from collected
peaks from the gel filtration were subjected to mass spectrometry
analysis (Figure 9).

HPLC C4 run in the LC–MS analysis. (A) Column binding fraction
corresponding to mature RmL. (B) Nonbinding fraction that shows two
peaks, the first being the cleaved propeptide and the second mature
RmL. The association of the propeptide with the mature protein of
the lipase appears to be noncovalent, indicating that wild-type ProRmL is easily cleaved. Intact molecular weight analyses
were performed using a MAXIS II electrospray mass spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, DE). The samples were first diluted to 0.1
mg/mL in MQ water. The diluted samples were applied to an AdvanceBio
Desalting-RP column (Agilent Technologies) followed by washing and
elution from the column running an acetonitrile linear gradient and
introduced to the electrospray source with a flow of 400 mL/min by
an Ultimate 3000 LC system (Dionex). Data analysis was performed with
DataAnalysis version 4.3 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, DE).

Purification and Characterization
of the RmL Propeptide
The RmL propeptide was separated from
mature RmL in a two-step purification
process at pH approximately 2.0–2.5. The starting material
(unbound fraction from a hydrophobic interaction purification of the
lipase) was diluted 20-fold in 10% (w/w) EtOH and 1% (w/w) formic
acid and applied on a C8-silica resin (SP-200-15-C8-HP from Daiso
Co., Ltd.). The column was washed with 10% (w/w) EtOH and 1% (w/w)
formic acid, and the peptide was eluted as a very broad product peak
with a linear gradient from 10% (w/w) EtOH and 1% (w/w) formic acid
to 50% (w/w) EtOH and 1% (w/w) formic acid. RmL–propeptide-containing
fractions as identified by peptide mapping by MS (next section) were
combined and diluted 10-fold in dH2O and applied on a C5-silica
resin (C5 Jupiter 10 μm, 300 Å from Phenomenex). The column
was washed with 10% (w/w) EtOH and 1% (w/w) formic acid, and the peptide
was eluted as a broad product peak with a linear gradient from 10%
(w/w) EtOH and 1% (w/w) formic acid to 50% (w/w) and 1% (w/w) formic
acid. RmL–propeptide-containing fractions, as identified by
peptide mapping by MS, were combined and dried in a centrifugal evaporator
at room temperature. The dried material was dissolved in 50 mM Na-acetate
(pH 4).

Protein identification was performed by tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of peptides released by protease digestion.
Purified samples were first TCA-precipitated, and the protein pellet
was then solubilized in a guanidine-HCL denaturation buffer heated
with DTT for reduction of disulfide bonds, followed by alkylation
with iodoacetamide. The samples were then washed and digested with
a specific trypsin on a 10 kDa cutoff filter membrane. Following digestion,
the resulting tryptic peptides were extracted and analyzed on an Orbitrap
LTQ Velos Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) where peptide
masses and peptide fragment masses were measured.

The experimental
masses were compared with the theoretical peptide
values, and peptide fragment masses of proteins stored in databases
using the mass search program
Mascot (Matrix Science). In addition to the mature protein sequence,
the data showed significant sequence coverage of the propeptide, residues
−30–94.

Cloning, Expression,
and Purification of the Deletion Variant: ProRmL-del
With the aim of producing a more stable
variant of ProRmL, a construct, ProRmL-del, was designed in which the first two residues, Ser95-Ile96,
of the mature enzyme were deleted, as shown in the Results and Discussion section above. The specific cleavage
was identified by MS analysis, and since no other significant cleavage
sites were observed, it was assumed that cleavage is carried out by
a specific endo-protease. Since the primary determinant for most endo-proteases
is the P1 or P1′ position relative to the cleavage site, we
aimed to remove the cleavage site by a double deletion of the P1 and
P1′ amino acids. It was hoped that this variant would be resistant
to automaturation and hence provide a stable form of the prolipase
for structural and kinetics studies. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis
was used to generate variants with two overlapping primers, with the
forward primer having the desired mutation in a single PCR reaction.
The PCR product was treated with DpnI restriction
enzyme for 6 h at 37 °C, which digested the methylated or the
parental template DNA, while the newly formed mutated DNA strands
that were nonmethylated remained intact. The resulting PCR product
was used to transform competent E. coli cells; the plasmid DNA was isolated (public patent number WO 2017/093318
PCT/EP2016/079277) from the single isolated transformants and sent
for sequence analysis, which confirmed the presence of the desired
mutation. The results confirmed that the plasmid DNA was transformed
in A. oryzae ToC1512 by the protoplast
mode. Transformants were screened for protein expression on a small
scale by inoculation of spores in 2 mL of expression media (M400)
in 96-well culture plates and grown stationary for 4 days at 34 °C
after which protein expression was analyzed on SDS-PAGE. The expressing
colony was streaked on COVE-N-agar slants from which shake-flask fermentation
was carried out in M400 media in 1 L of baffled shake flasks for 4
days at 34 °C and 180 rpm. Protein expression was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE. Once the expression was confirmed, the fermentation broth
was used for protein purification.

The culture supernatant from
the A. oryzae broth was first clarified
by vacuum filtration using a combination of Seitz filter and Whatman
glass filter GF/F grade in a Buchner funnel, followed by sterile filtration
using a Supor-200 0.2 μm filter on a vacuum filtration unit.
Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the clarified broth to bring it
to 1.5 M saturation, and the precipitates formed were removed by filtration.
The sample was loaded on to a Butyl-Toyopearl column (15 × 200
mm; bed volume, 25 mL) pre-equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0)
+ 1 M (NH4)2SO4 at a flow rate of
5.5 mL/min. Unbound impurities were removed by washing with equilibration
buffer.

Elution of ProRmL-del including the
propeptide
(upper band on SDS-PAGE, Figure 2a) was carried out using 25 mM HEPES (pH 7) and 0.9
M (NH4)2SO4. A second elution was
performed using 0.8 M (NH4)2SO4 and
0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, which removed the
majority of the impurities. Purified ProRmL-del was
subjected to Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column for desalting.

Inhibition of RmL by Its Propeptide
Inhibition of hydrolytic
activity was determined by using the industrially relevant GLAD assay,
measuring the release of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) by purified
mature RmL incubated with and without a propeptide (RmL–propeptide
incubated at a molar ratio of 1:64) for 15 min in 0.2 M HEPES, 1 mM
CaCl2, and 10 ppm Triton X-100 (adjusted to pH 8.5). As
a substrate, we used cellulose cotton linters, Avicel PH-101 (Sigma-Aldrich,
11365), uniformly coated with a 4.5:1 mixture of olive oil (Sigma-Aldrich,
O-1514) and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate (oleic acid 4-methylumbelliferyl
ester (Sigma-Aldrich, 75164): 4 mg/mL in n-hexane
(Sigma-Aldrich, 15671)). The coated cellulose fibers were suspended
in 0.2 M HEPES, 3 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and
10 ppm Triton X-100 mixed with 3.3 g/L detergent solution using detergent
model B (model B composition: 1% (w/w) NaOH, 7.2% (w/w) LAS, 3% (w/w)
SLES, 5.5% (w/w) soy and coco fatty acids, 6.6% (w/w) AEO, 3.33% (w/w)
triethanol amine, 2% (w/w) Na-citrate, 0.5% (w/w) DTMPA, 6% (w/w)
MPG, 3% EtOH, 1.7% (w/w) glycerol, 1% (w/w) sodium formate, 0.1% (w/w)
PCA; adjusted to pH 8.5) and RmL −/+ propeptide. The enzyme
activity at room temperature was followed by measuring the fluorescence
(kinetic mode) every 30 s at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and
emission wavelength of 445 nm from 1 to 6 min. The plate was only
mixed by shaking for 5 s before the first measurement.

Propeptide
Binding to Mature R. miehei Lipase
Binding was measured using fluorescence polarization
(FP) and a Polarstar Omega instrument from BMG Labtech using a black
96-well plate (Nunc) and 100 μL assay volume. The peptide SDVETKYGMALNATSYC-A488
was synthesized by Schafer-N (Copenhagen, Denmark) at >95% purity,
and purified mature RmL was used for measuring peptide binding. The
fluorescent propeptide was diluted in HEPES buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH
7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2) to 0.9 μM and mixed
with increasing concentrations of mature RmL (0.0002, 0.02, 0.2, 0.8,
2, and 10 μM) in duplicate. After incubating for 30 min at room
temperature, the resulting steady-state equilibrium FP was detected
in mP, and data were fitted to a Langmuir 1:1 model using Igor Pro
(WaveMetrics).

Crystallization and Data Collection
The Full-Length ProRmL Sample
A cluster
of plates was obtained in Hampton screen condition B3 (30% PEG8K,
0.1 M Na-cacodylate (pH 6.5), 0.2 M ammonium; Table 2). Data were collected at the Diamond Light
Source, beamline I02, processed using MOSFLM26 and scaled with Aimless.27 The space
group was C2, with cell dimensions a = 98.04 Å, b = 61.02 Å, c = 62.65 Å, and β = 111.97°. The data-processing
statistics are given in Table 3.

The ProRmL-del Variant
Protease inhibitor
cocktail (Pierce) was added straight after thawing the sample after
transportation with the aim of preventing the cleavage of the propeptide.
The protein was concentrated to 14 mg/mL in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0).
Initial crystallization screening was carried out using sitting-drop
vapor diffusion with drops set up using a Mosquito Crystal liquid-handling
robot (TTP LabTech, U.K.), with 150 nL of protein solution and 150
nL of reservoir solution in 96-well format plates (MRC 2-well crystallization
microplate, Swissci, Switzerland) equilibrated against 54 μL
of reservoir solution. Experiments were carried out at room temperature
with a number of commercial screens.

Initial crystals were obtained
in Hampton condition C9 (4 M sodium formate) and were further optimized
in a 24-well Linbro dish in hanging drop format. Final crystals were
obtained in 4 M Na formate (the same reservoir content as the initial
condition, but crystals were bigger and single after scale-up and
addition of 0.1% β-octyl-glycoside to the protein) and were
cryoprotected with 3.3 M Na malonate. The final crystallization drops
were checked on an SDS gel to confirm that the intact propeptide was
still present. Only the drop content could be checked; the crystals
were too small to give an unambiguous result on a gel or by mass spectrometry.
Final crystallization details are given in Table 2.

Data to 1.4 Å resolution were
collected at the Diamond Light
Source, beamline I04–1, processed using XDS28 within the xia2 pipeline,29 and
scaled with Aimless.27 The space group
was C2, with cell dimensions a =
98.0 Å, b = 61.0 Å, c =
62.0 Å, and β = 112°. The data processing statistics
are given in Table 3.

Structure Solution and Refinement
All computations
were carried out using programs from the CCP4 suite,30 unless otherwise stated.

The Wild-Type Full-Length ProRmL
The
structure was solved using Molrep,31 with
the structure of mature RmL (3TGL) as a search model. The chain was
traced with Buccaneer, and the model was refined with Refmac,32 iterated with manual model correction using
Coot.33 The quality of the final model
was validated using MolProbity34 as part
of the Phenix package.35 The final refinement
statistics are given in Table 4.

The ProRmL-del Variant
The structure
was solved using Molrep,31 with the structure
of native full-length ProRmL as a search model. Model
building and refinement were carried out as described above for wild-type ProRmL.

Analysis and Re-Refinement of R. microsporus var. chinensis Lipase
The coordinates
and structure factors for R. microsporus var. chinensis lipase (PDB ID: 4L3W; henceforth, RcL) were downloaded from the PDB, together
with the sequence from UniProt (entry A3FM73_RHICH). The structure
contained the mature RcL and an extended feature modeled by the depositors
as a set of ethylene glycol molecules. Inspection of the density suggested
that the latter were in fact a region of the propeptide of RcL, and
we edited the coordinates to remove ethylene glycols from the model.
Residues from the propeptide were then built using Buccaneer, followed
by refinement using Refmac and Coot. The modified structure is available
in the Supporting Information.
