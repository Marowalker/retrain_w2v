A straightforward
green synthesis of 4-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one 6 is reported from ninhydrin 1 via condensation with ethyl acetoacetate, followed by cyclization
with hydrazine hydrate in water as a benign solvent. Tetraazafluoranthen-3-thione 7 was obtained using Lawesson’s reagent. N-alkylated
tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 8–12 and S-alkylated
analogues 13–15 were synthesized via alkylation.
The investigation of the unique reactivity of 4-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one/thione toward the alkylation and aza-Michael additions

Introduction
Fluoranthenes
represent an intriguing class of polycyclic aromatic
compounds with remarkable and interesting applications.1−3 Considerable research has focused on their sensing as well as organic
electronics applications4 and related natural
products. Many fungal natural products contain a fluoranthene in their
structures, for example, hortein5 and daldinone
E.6 Moreover, FLUN-550 was introduced as
a fluoranthene-based fluorescent probe for selective staining of intracellular
lipid droplets.6 Synthesis and derivatization
of fluoranthenes have received much attention in the recent years.
Diels–Alder reaction7−10 and transition metal-catalyzed reactions are the
most commonly used methods for their synthesis.11−22

The vast majority of reported fluoranthenes were synthesized
from
1,8-dichloronaphthalenes and arylboronic acids in the presence of
Pd catalyst under the conditions of high catalyst loading [20 mol
% Pd2(dba)3] and high reaction temperatures
(155–175 °C).23 Synthesis of
fluoranthenes was accomplished via inter- and intramolecular C–H
arylation in three steps in the presence of Pd catalyst.24 Substituted fluoranthenes were obtained selectively
via Suzuki–Miyaura reaction using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)
(Pd(PPh3)4) and Pd(dppf)Cl2 catalysts
starting from 1,8-diiodonaphthalene.25

Fluoranthenes aza analogues were also synthesized by Koutentis
and co-workers via an oxidative and nonoxidative cyclization protocol.26

Herein, we report a novel, straightforward,
simple, effective,
and catalyst free method for the synthesis of tetraazafluoranthen-3-one
in a short time. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no literature reports for the construction of tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one so far (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Results and Discussion
As part of our current studies on
the development of new routes
in heterocyclic synthesis,28−35 here we focused on the synthesis of new heterocyclic systems from
ninhydrin. Stirring ninhydrin 1 with ethyl acetoacetate 2 in water for 15 min afforded ethyl indeno[1,2-b]furan-3-carboxylate 3 in excellent yield.33 Reaction of 3 with hydrazine hydrate
in water or ethanol and reflux for 10 min, interestingly, afforded
tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one 6 in good
yield. Heating of 3 with thiourea, surprisingly, gave
indeno-imidazole 4 (Scheme 1). The plausible reaction mechanism of the
formation of 4 by nucleophilic ring opening/ring closer
via the intermediate was followed by removal of ethyl acetoacetate,
as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Indeno-Imidazole 4 and Tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one 6
The suggested mechanism for the formation of tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one 6 involves, at first, condensation of
ethyl acetoacetate with ninhydrin to give ethyl indeno[1,2-b]furan-3-carboxylate 3, which was attacked
by two hydrazine molecules at the carbonyl carbon (C4) and the carbon
(C8b), leading to cleavage of the furan ring with the loss of four
water molecules and EtOH. During this process, recyclization occurs
to form tetraazafluoranthen-3-one (Scheme 2). The structure of 4-methyl-1,2,5,6-tetraazafluoranthen-3(2H)-one 6 was deduced from its nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra, which showed the methyl protons at 2.99 ppm
and four aromatic protons between 7.96 and 8.19 ppm, in addition to
one deshielded signal at 13.29 ppm, which was assigned for NH. The
methyl carbon appeared at 21.26 ppm in addition to 12 aromatic carbons
including C=O, which appeared between 119.10 and 158.94 ppm.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of Tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 6
Reaction of ninhydrin with
thiourea and thiosemicarbazide in water
and reflux for 10 min were performed to afford the crystalline compounds
indeno-imidazole 4 and 1-amino-indeno-imidazole 5, respectively, in good yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 2-Thioxo-tetrahydroindeno[2,1-d]imidazol-ones 4 and 5
Thionation of tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 6 was achieved
using Lawesson’s reagent in dry toluene to produce tetraazafluoranthen-3-thione 7 in good yield (Scheme 4). The desired thione 7 did not form utilizing
P2S5 and pyridine. 4-Methyl-tetraazafluoranthene-3-thione 7 structure was confirmed from the NMR spectra, which showed
the NH proton at 14.76 ppm and the thiocarbonyl carbon at 181.43 ppm.

Scheme 4 Thionation of 6 to Afford Tetraazafluoranthen-3-thione 7
Given the uniqueness of tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 6 and 7, we have also explored their reactivity
in further
synthetic transformations including N/S-alkylation and aza-Michael
additions.

Coupling of tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 6 with allyl
bromide, ethyl chloroacetate, benzyl bromide, amyl bromide, and phenacyl
bromide in the presence of K2CO3 in acetone
and dimethyl formamide (DMF) afforded the N-alkylated products 8–12 in good yields (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of N-Alkylated Tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 8–12
N-alkylation products 8–12 were confirmed from
the loss of the NH signal. Further, aza- not or oxa-alkylation of
tetraazafluoranthen-3-one was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis for 8.

From the above-mentioned experiment,
other analogues of S-alkylated
tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 13–15 were explored.
Coupling of 7 with allyl bromide, ethyl chloroacetate,
and benzyl bromide afforded the S-alkylated products 13–15, respectively (Scheme 6). S-alkylation of 7 was confirmed from the S–CH2–carbon signals around 33.00 ppm to yield 13–15.

Scheme 6 Synthesis of S-Alkylated Tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 13–15
Aza-Michael addition of 6 or 7 as Michael
donor to acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate as Michael acceptors in
DMF/EtOH containing Et3N leads to aza-Michael adduct 16–18 (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Aza-Michael Addition and Synthesis of Tetraazafluoranthen-3-one
Scaffold 16–18
Aza- not thia-Michael addition was deduced from the methylene signal
54.22 ppm and thiocarbonyl carbon (C=S) at 180.08 ppm. Additionally,
single-crystal X-ray analysis of compound 16 was performed.

Interestingly, chlorination of 6 by reflux in POCl3 led to chlorination of methyl branch to provide the halogenated
compound 19, whereas compound 20 was not
obtained (Scheme 8).

Scheme 8 Chlorination of 6 Using POCl3
Chlorination of the methyl group in 19 was
deduced
from the disappearance of the proton and carbon methyl signals; on
the other hand, a new carbon signal appeared at 95.46 ppm corresponding
to the highly deshielded −CCl3. The NH proton signal
was found at 13.44 ppm. The plausible mechanism for the formation
of compound 19 proceeds via typical free radical substitution
reaction (Scheme 9).36,37

Scheme 9 Proposed Mechanism for Compound 19
Conclusions
In conclusion, green syntheses of indeno-imidazole,
1-amino-indeno-imidazole,
and tetraazafluoranthen-3-one were achieved in water, starting from
ninhydrin. Compound 4 was formed via nucleophile ring
opening and closer. Tetraazafluoranthen-3-one 6 was converted
to tetraazafluoranthen-3-thione 7 using Lawesson’s
reagent. In addition, a set of N/S-alkylations of tetraazafluoranthen-3-one
analogue were performed. Aza-Michael addition was also investigated.
Further studies are underway in our laboratory.
