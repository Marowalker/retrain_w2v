Direct hydrothermal
conversion (HC) of macroalgae Enteromorpha prolifera was conducted over the temperature
range of 140–240 °C. At 160 °C, monosaccharides and
small molecular acids began to generate. A high yield (18.8%) of monosaccharides
was obtained at 180 °C, whereas 29.6% of small molecular organic
acids was attained at 200 °C. Formic acid (FA) was then employed
as a catalyst, which could selectively catalyze the conversion of
hemicellulose at low temperature (94.1%, 140 °C). Rhamnose (45.2%)
based on the mass of carbohydrates in E. prolifera was produced by the catalysis of 0.7 mL of FA (160 °C, 60 min,
1 g of biomass loading). A low ratio of biomass amount to water was
beneficial to the solution of water-soluble components of hemicellulose
in E. prolifera to get high yields
to monosaccharides. HC showed promise to be an applicable and efficient
method in the treatment of E. prolifera with high conversion of carbohydrates.

==== Body
Introduction
The rapidly growing
demand for fossil fuels and related environmental
pollution had raised great concern on the exploitation of green and
sustainable resources. Enormous amount of works has been devoted to
the utilization of biomass and their derivatives, including the production
of chemicals, bio-oils, and bio-based materials.1−3 Algae as renewable
resources were considered to be a promising alternative to replace
the fossil resources.4 The green tide broken
out in China’s Yellow Sea near Qingdao in recent years formed
a huge number of drifting Enteromorpha prolifera, one kind of macroalgae, which flocked and then floated to other
maritime spaces, then became barrier, and soon began to decay. The
large-scale outburst of E. prolifera did harm not only to the coastal ecological environment but also
to the seawater quality and human health, which had a strong impact
on the local tourism and influenced the economic and ecological balance.5,6 The effective utilization of E. prolifera could not only remit the pressure of environment but also turn waste
into wealth. E. prolifera had the advantages
of no occupation for land resources, no request for fresh water, and
so on compared with the terrestrial biomass, as described in the references.7,8 Moreover, E. prolifera was rich in polysaccharides,9 which was good for the production of value-added
chemicals or bio-alcohols. As a new resource and environmental pollutant, E. prolifera should be efficiently utilized, which
was of great practical significance.

A great number of studies
have been focused on the thermochemical
conversion (pyrolysis and liquefaction) of algae.10−12 Pyrolysis characteristics
and kinetics of E. prolifera were studied,
and the results indicated that three stages of dehydration, primary
devolatilization, and residual decomposition appeared during pyrolysis,
and this kind of alga was suitable for pyrolysis.13 Similar results were found by other researchers.14,15 Fast pyrolysis of E. prolifera for
bio-oil production was conducted in a free-fall reactor at different
temperatures ranging from 100 to 750 °C, and the average heat
value of the bio-oil obtained was 25.33 MJ/kg, with a higher oxygen
content of 30.27 wt %.5 Hydrothermal liquefaction
of E. prolifera was investigated at
300 °C, for 30 min with 5 wt % Na2CO3 added,
and the highest bio-oil yield was 23.0 wt %. The results showed that
the bio-oil was complex in composition and could potentially produce
possible value-added chemicals.16 Another
work used alcohols as a solvent to produce ester compounds from E. prolifera by liquefaction. The bio-oil contained
a considerable fraction of light components of biodiesel but still
had high oxygen content. Thus, further separation and refining of
bio-oil were necessary.17

Fewer studies
have focused on the hydrothermal conversion (HC)
of E. prolifera to produce value-added
chemicals, taking the advantage of the high oxygen content of the
material itself. Monosaccharides are expected as renewable platform
chemicals, which are versatile precursor to biodegradable plastics,
chemicals, fuels, and medicine.18,19 Rhamnose is of great
importance in cosmetics industry. For example, in skincare, the primary
implication of rhamnose is to form rhamnolipids, which serve as a
good emulsifier and surfactant. Rhamnolipids could also be used in
antiaging and antiwrinkle products.20,21 The conversion
of macroalgae to rhamnose is a promising process for the efficient
utilization of harmful marine algae, which could be also regarded
as a sustainable and important source. Fractional hydrothermal of
biomass was explored in our previous work.22 Different components in material had different solubilities in water
or organic solvent. Nearly, all of the cellulose in the selected biomass
types were dissolved and degraded into oligomers with molecular weight
of 200–400 Da under the NaCl–H2O system.
Another work about selective conversion of lignin in corncob residue
to monophenols with high yield and selectivity showed the possibility
of fractional HC of actual biomass.23

Here in, the study on the hydrothermal process of E. prolifera was conducted from 140 to 240 °C.
The effect of different temperatures on the distribution of liquid
products and the property of solid residue was discussed. Formic acid
(FA) was employed as a catalyst in the present system to catalyze
the conversion of E. prolifera to produce
monosaccharides because carbohydrate biomass could produce FA with
high yield as reported.24,25 Thus, the use of FA
might inhibit the further decomposition of monosaccharides and realize
the in situ catalytic process. The reaction temperature and time,
effect of dosage of FA, and the biomass loading on the production
of monosaccharides were also discussed. We attempted to search a rather
splendid method for the utilization of E. prolifera and produce more value-added chemicals.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of E. prolifera
The contents
of different elements in E.
prolifera obtained were the followings: carbon 32.44%,
hydrogen 5.36%, and nitrogen 0.91%. Othersa is mainly composed
of oxygen and ash, which include inorganic compounds as confirmed
by ICP (Al: 1.14 wt %; Ca: 9.92 wt %; Mg: 4.62 wt %; Na: 1.79 wt %;
and Fe: 1.49 wt %). A small amount of lipids 1.5% was extracted from
the material, and a lower content of proteins (5.7%) was calculated
by the nitrogen content from elemental analysis correspondingly. The
most abundant component in E. prolifera was carbohydrates (42.4%), which then subdivided into hemicellulose
(23.1%), cellulose (13.8%), and some water-soluble carbohydrates.
Othersb includes vitamin, amino acid, and other bioactive
components in E. prolifera. Ash (25.1%)
and volatiles (62%) were also detected. These results showed that E. prolifera was lipid less and with high percentage
of carbohydrates (Table 1). Thus, further study was performed to convert the carbohydrates
in order to obtain monosaccharides.

Conversion
of Hemicellulose and Cellulose without and with FA
The HC
of E. prolifera without FA
catalyst was conducted at 140–240 °C as a control group.
The residue obtained was analyzed using chemical titration and element
analysis. The conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose and the yield
of residue after reaction were first investigated. As shown in Figure 1, the conversion
of both hemicellulose and cellulose augmented with the increase of
temperature. As for hemicellulose, a higher conversion (70.8%) was
achieved at a relatively lower temperature of 140 °C and it changed
in a small scale (70.8–92.9%) when the temperature increased
from 140 to 240 °C, which demonstrated that HC was suitable for
the conversion of hemicellulose at relatively low temperature. The
conversion of cellulose was much lower than that of hemicellulose
at lower temperature (140–200 °C, 20.7–58.6%),
but it increased obviously from 58.6 to 91.9% with temperature rising
from 200 to 240 °C. The increase of temperature led to great
decomposition of cellulose, especially when the temperature was higher
than 200 °C. It was shown that a higher temperature was required
to reach a higher conversion of cellulose. Nevertheless, 92.9% of
hemicellulose and 91.9% of cellulose were converted at 240 °C.
The fractional conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose would be
realized by controlling temperature, that is, lower temperature was
beneficial to the conversion of hemicellulose. The residue deceased
from 41.6 to 34.5% and from 140 to 160 °C and maintained almost
unchanged between 160 and 200 °C (34.5–33.5%). This phenomenon
might caused by the oligomers or humins formed in the HC reactions
by complicated reactions, such as aldol condensation,26,27 which stay as solids in the residue fraction and led to an increase
on the conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose. A lower amount of
residue 26.6% was obtained at 240 °C. In general, higher temperature
leads more conversion of hemicellulose, cellulose, and other components
of E. prolifera, resulting in the reduction
of residue.

Figure 1 Conversion of hemicellulose and cellulose and the yield of residue
with temperature in the absence of FA. Reaction conditions: 100 mL
of water; 60 min; 3 g of biomass.

The HC of E. prolifera with
FA as
a catalyst was investigated. The conversion of hemicellulose, cellulose,
and the residue is shown in Table 2. As could be seen, the conversion of hemicellulose
was maintained at a relatively high level (94%) from 140 to 180 °C,
whereas the conversion of cellulose increased from 6 to 48.3%. When
temperature rise to 150 °C, glucose derived mainly from cellulose
could be observed. It could be found that the rise of temperature
leads to the increase of conversion of cellulose, as mentioned in
the HC of E. prolifera without FA.
Compared with the result of reaction without FA at 140 °C, the
conversion of hemicellulose increased from 70.8 to 94.1%, which indicated
that the conversion of hemicellulose was promoted by FA. FA could
catalyze the conversion of hemicellulose selectively at relativity
low temperature. When increasing the temperature to 160 °C, the
conversion of hemicellulose increased from 88.1 to 97.1%, whereas
the conversion of cellulose varied from 22.7 to 26.4%. At 180 °C,
the conversion of cellulose was further increased to 48.3%, which
is higher than that without FA (36.5%). The reason for the high conversion
of hemicellulose might be ascribed to the H+ in water formed
by the ionization of FA, which would attack the O atom in glycosidic
bond and then the O atom was protonated. The positive charge was transferred
to C atom along with the broken of C–O bond. After then, the
C+ was attacked by H2O and an OH– was obtained to form new polysaccharides, with the release of H+. This process was circulated, and the hemicellulose was gradually
degraded.28,29 As for cellulose, when the reaction temperature
was above 160 °C, the acidic environment formed by FA could also
promote the conversion of it. Overall, the total conversion of carbohydrates
increased with the presence of FA.

Formation
of Monosaccharides in Liquid Products
The
amounts of monosaccharides and small molecular weight products without
FA as catalyst are listed in Table 3. The yield to glucose, xylose, and rhamnose was first
increased and then decreased with rising temperature. No glucose was
detected at 140 and 160 °C. As the temperature rise to 180 °C,
the amount of rhamnose increased from 1.58 to 10.92%. Also, the amount
of xylose increased to 4.98%, and 2.87% of glucose was obtained. The
formation temperature of glucose was higher than that for xylose and
rhamnose. More monosaccharides (18.77%) were obtained at 180 °C.
It was demonstrated that 180 °C was suitable for the production
of monosaccharides. Further increase of temperature to 200 °C,
the amount of xylose and glucose decreased and rhamnose was not detected.
Glucose was not detected above 220 °C, and when the temperature
increased to 240 °C, none of the monosaccharides was detected.
These could be ascribed to the fact that higher temperature promoted
the conversion and/or decomposition of monosaccharides to form a variety
of products, including hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), acetic acid (AA),
lactic acid, and so on. Among these monosaccharides, rhamnose obtained
at 180 °C (10.92%) was the most abundant among the monosaccharides
in the absence of FA catalyst.

The HC of E. prolifera with FA as
a catalyst was conducted at different temperatures with 0.7 mL of
FA. The amounts of monosaccharides obtained are shown in Table 4. As could be seen,
the addition of FA greatly promoted the generation of rhamnose. At
140 °C, 4.9% of xylose and 18.8% of rhamnose were obtained, pretty
higher than those obtained without FA. When temperature increased,
the yield to monosaccharides increased. The highest yield of 41.7%
rhamnose was obtained at 160 °C, whereas there was only 5.22%
of rhamnose obtained without FA. The variation of xylose and rhamnose
behaved coincidently. Higher temperature (180 °C) leads to further
conversion of xylose and rhamnose, resulting in decreased yields.
However, the amount of glucose kept increasing with temperature rising.
Glucose (17.6%) was obtained at 180 °C along with the relatively
high conversion of cellulose (48.3%). Normally, FA can be decomposed
into H2 and CO2 in the presence of metal catalysts
and acts as a hydrogen donor.30,31 However, on the basis
of the products formed, no hydrogenated products were observed. This
might be caused by the fact that there is no metal catalyst presented
in the system of this study. Thus, we speculate that FA acted only
as an acid to catalyze the hydrolysis of carbohydrates under the conditions
studied in the present work. The distribution of molecular weight
showed that the content of small molecular compounds (Mw < 300 Da) increased with temperature. The compounds
with Mw > 1000 Da were converted into
small molecular compounds and oligomers (1000–300 Da) as temperature
increasing. A highest content (19.2%) of oligomers was obtained at
160 °C. Further increasing the temperature to 180 °C, the
content of oligomers decreased to 11.9%, whereas the content of compounds
with Mw > 1000 Da and Mw < 300 Da increased to 13.3 and 74.8%, respectively.
Thus, some of the oligomers form macromolecular compounds with Mw > 1000 Da by polymerization at 180 °C.
Meanwhile, some other oligomers would be decomposed into small molecular
compounds (Table 5).

Impact
of Dosage of FA on the Production of Monosaccharides
The
effect of the amount of FA on the production of monosaccharides
was conducted at 140 °C for 60 min with 3 g of biomass. The liquid
products contained were mainly xylose and rhamnose. The yield to xylose
and rhamnose increased with the augment of FA added. It was ascribed
to the acidic environment caused by FA, which promoted the breakage
of polysaccharides. A higher yield 18.8% of rhamnose was obtained
at 0.7 mL of FA. When the dosage of FA was 0.9 mL, the yield to xylose
and rhamnose decreased (Table S1). An underlying
reason might be the fact that the higher acidic solvent promoted the
further reaction of monosaccharides. The conversion of hemicellulose
increased to above 90% with the addition of FA. Nevertheless, the
conversion of cellulose was quite low under these conditions.

Impact
of Reaction Time on the Production of Monosaccharides
Further
studies about the effect of reaction time (15–75
min) were conducted with 0.7 mL of FA and 3 g of biomass at 160 °C.
The conversion of hemicellulose reached to 96.2% at a short time of
15 min, and the extension of time could not promote the conversion
of hemicellulose obviously (from 96.2 to 98.2%). The conversion of
cellulose at 15 min was about 15.8% and then maintained at about 25%
between 30 and 60 min, reached to 29.3% at 75 min (Table S2). Increasing reaction temperature from 160 to 180
°C, the conversion of cellulose increased from 26.4 to 48.3%,
whereas the extension of reaction time did not affect markedly (about
25%). The yield to xylose and rhamnose showed the tendency of first
increasing and then decreasing from 15 to 75 min. At 60 min, a higher
yield 41.7% to rhamnose was obtained. The yield to glucose kept increasing
with reaction time, indicating that more time was required for cellulose
conversion (Table S3). Before 75 min, the
extension of time could promote the decomposition of compounds with Mw > 1000 Da to small molecular compounds
(Figure S2). After 75 min, the yield to
rhamnose
decreased, along with the content of macromolecular compounds increased
(polymerization occurred).

Impact of Biomass Loading on the Production
of Monosaccharides
Different biomass loadings (1–5
g) were investigated (Figure 2, Table S4). Hemicellulose (99.7%)
and cellulose (33.2%) were
converted when 1 g of biomass was used. Still, the conversion of hemicellulose
was much higher than that of cellulose. A relative high yield (45.2%)
to rhamnose was obtained when the minimum mass of biomass was used.
The yield to glucose, xylose, and rhamnose was augmented with the
decrease of biomass. When the amount of E. prolifera was 5 g, the yield of glucose and xylose decreased to 4.9 and 8.6%,
but still a relatively high amount of rhamnose 32.9% was obtained.
Hemicellulose contained dissociative −OH, which makes it easy
to dissolve in water. The first stage is the dissolving out of water-soluble
fraction, then the complex phase hydrolysis of insoluble polysaccharides
to form oligosaccharides. The last stage is the dissolution of oligosaccharides
in homogeneous phase to form monosaccharides.28 Because of the limitation of the equilibrium concentration of products
in the process of HC, the low ratio of biomass amount to water was
beneficial to the solution of water-soluble components of hemicellulose
in E. prolifera to get high yields
to monosaccharides. Further work will be performed on the separation
of different monosaccharides to get pure products in the future.

Conclusions
Monosaccharides (18.8%) were obtained at
180 °C. At 200 °C,
29.6% of acids was attained. Rhamnose (45.2%) was produced by the
catalysis of 0.7 mL of FA. FA could selectively catalyze the conversion
of hemicellulose at low temperature (94.1%, 140 °C). Considering
the output of products and no need for desiccation, HC was maintained
to be a more applicable and efficient method in the efficient utilization
of E. prolifera with high conversion
of hemicellulose and high yield to rhamnose.

Materials and Methods
Materials
The E. prolifera was collected in
Qingdao (China) in 2015, washed by water, and dried
by sunshine. The sample was ground into powder (80 mesh) and dried
in an oven at 373 K for 24 h before use. FA was purchased from J&K
Chemicals, AR. All chemicals used in this study were of AR grade.

HC of E. prolifera
The
HC of E. prolifera was conducted in
a 250 mL stainless-steel autoclave reactor equipped with a stirrer.
The dried E. prolifera sample (ca.
3 g) was placed in the reactor along with 100 mL of deionized water
as a solvent. Nitrogen was purged in the reactor to replace air, and
the initial pressure was 2.0 MPa. The stirring rate was set to be
400 rpm. The experiments were performed at designed temperature and
lasted for desired time. Once the reaction was completed, the reactor
was cooled down to the ambient temperature by a fan. The mixture in
the reactor was poured out, and the reactor was washed with water
solvent three times. Then, the solid residue was separated from the
liquid phase by filtration and then dried in an oven at 373 K (24
h) for calculation of the yield to residue. For the catalytic HC of E. prolifera, certain amount of FA was added into
the reaction mixture by a pipette. The rest of the processing procedures
was exactly the same as mentioned before. All experiments were conducted
three times.

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
The liquid products
obtained were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (DIONEX
U3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific), equipped with a refractive index
detector (RI-101, Shodex) and an aminex column (HPX-87H, 300 mm ×
7.8 mm, Bio-Rad). The eluent was dilute H2SO4 (5 mM) flowing at a rate of 0.60 mL·min–1 with the column temperature maintained at 50 °C. The concentrations
of all components were determined by comparison to standard calibration
curves.

Gel Permeation Chromatography
The molecular weight
distribution of liquid products was analyzed by using a gel permeation
chromatography (1260, Agilent) equipped with a column (PL aquagel-OH,
Agilent) and a RI detector. Pure water was used as the mobile phase
at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min–1, whereas column temperature
was maintained at 30 °C. Saccharide standards (180–600 000
Da) were used to obtain the calibration curve.

Biochemical Composition
of E. prolifera
The analysis
of E. prolifera was performed based
on our previous work.7 The total content
of lipids was determined based on the Bligh and
Dyer method. A DNS colorimetric analysis and a UV 4100-spectrophotometer
were employed to analyze the content of carbohydrates based on the
reference.32 The content of proteins was
calculated by the content of N element multiplied by the conversion
factor of 6.25 (National food safety standard. Determination of protein
in foods, GB 5009.5-2010). The moisture of raw materials was measured
by a NETZSCH TG 209F1 instrument, determined by the weight loss at
105 °C. Ash content was determined by the weight difference of
sample before and after calcination in a muffle furnace at 800 °C
for 4 h in air.

Chemical Titration
The content of
cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin in the residue and raw material was analyzed using chemical
titration methods. The details could be obtained from the reference.33,34

Element
Analysis
For the determination of carbon, hydrogen,
and nitrogen contents in the raw material and residue, a FLASH 1112
SERIES Element Analyzer was employed. The samples were all dried at
80 °C under vacuum condition before test.
