A nanoprecipitation procedure was utilized to prepare
novel diketopyrrolopyrrole-based
semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) with hyaluronic acid (HA)
and polysorbate 80. The nanoprecipitation led to the formation of
spherical nanoparticles with average diameters ranging from 100 to
200 nm, and a careful control over the structure of the parent conjugated
polymers was performed to probe the influence of π-conjugation
on the final photophysical and thermal stability of the resulting
SPNs. Upon generation of a series of novel SPNs, the optical and photophysical
properties of the new nanomaterials were probed in solution using
various techniques including transmission electron microscopy, dynamic
light scattering, small-angle neutron scattering, transient absorption,
and UV–vis spectroscopy. A careful comparison was performed
between the different SPNs to evaluate their excited-state dynamics
and photophysical properties, both before and after nanoprecipitation.
Interestingly, although soluble in organic solution, the nanoparticles
were found to exhibit aggregative behavior, resulting in SPNs that
exhibit excited-state behaviors that are very similar to aggregated
polymer solutions. Based on these findings, the formation of HA- and
polysorbate 80-based nanoparticles does not influence the photophysical
properties of the conjugated polymers, thus opening new opportunities
for the design of bioimaging agents and nanomaterials for health-related
applications.

Introduction
Organic semiconducting polymers are a
special class of materials
that have been attracting a lot of attention for a rich variety of
applications in optoelectronics, mostly because of their intrinsic
charge transport properties, exceptional optical properties, and synthetic
versatility.1−3 Throughout the years, π-conjugated polymers
have been used as active materials in high-performance electronic
devices such as organic field-effect transistors,4,5 organic
photovoltaics,6,7 and organic light-emitting diodes.8,9 These materials have also been shown to be particularly promising
candidates for the development of advanced stretchable and conformable
bioelectronics and sensing devices.10−13 Recently, it has been shown that
by employing different preparation strategies, π-conjugated
polymers can be aggregated in solution and stabilized by hydrophilic
polymers, leading to the preparation of a new type of nanomaterials,
the so-called semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs).14−16 Interestingly, SPNs are easily accessible synthetically, present
good stability in aqueous dispersion, and their size can be easily
fine-tuned. More importantly, SPNs were shown to preserve the rich
optical properties of the native semiconducting polymer, which led
to their evaluation as bioimaging agents (near infrared, NIR) and
potential application in the treatment of various diseases through
photothermal therapy.17−19 Currently, most approaches for labeling and visualizing
extracellular materials (proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, etc.)
use commercial fluorescent compounds, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate
and rhodamine.20 Despite being well known
and accessible, these compounds can suffer from leaching and poor
photostability, which remain important for long-term tracking and
imaging purposes. Therefore, the design of novel SPNs and the investigation
of their optical and photophysical properties are highly desirable
toward a more efficient platform for bioimaging and therapeutics.

For the preparation of novel SPNs through nanoprecipitation, the
utilization of dye molecules capable of absorbing in the NIR range
has been shown to be a promising design strategy to access improved
optical properties.21,22 Among others, diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP) is a good candidate for designing new SPNs for various reasons.4,23,24 First, DPP is a planar electron-deficient
unit that is synthetically tunable, and its preparation is well known
because of the fact that it has been widely used for optoelectronic
applications. Moreover, DPP-based materials typically possess excellent
light and thermal stability, making them particularly suitable for
laser cellular tracking through photoacoustic imaging. Finally, the
energy gaps can be easily tuned through copolymerization with other
monomers, thus enabling a fine-tuning of its absorption and photophysical
properties. Many recent SPN systems have been reported using DPP-based
materials and were shown to be particularly efficient for photothermal
stability and photoacoustic imaging.25−27 Despite these important
outcomes, the investigation of the synthetic design rules to fully
understand the fine-tuning of the photophysical properties of DPP-based
SPNs and the utilization of new hydrophilic coprecipitation agents
with novel properties are still highly desirable.

Herein, we
report the preparation of new SPNs through the nanoprecipitation
of a series of DPP-based conjugated polymers with hyaluronic acid
(HA) and polysorbate 80 (Figure 1). Widely used for the design of novel biomaterials,
HA and polysorbate 80 are known to be specific targets of specific
receptors of various tumors, mostly associated with glioblastoma.28−32 Furthermore, both biomaterials have been previously utilized transitioning
nanoparticles across the blood–brain barrier, which is particularly
interesting for the design of new SPNs.33,34 In addition
to the utilization of new hydrophilic coprecipitation agents, a systematic
evaluation was performed by varying the main chain structure by inserting
different donor moieties, including thiophene (T), bithiophene (2T),
and terthiophene (3T) into the DPP polymer to probe for the impact
of π-conjugation extension on the photophysical properties of
SPNs before and after nanoprecipitation. The new SPNs were characterized
by various techniques, including UV–vis spectroscopy, dynamic
light scattering (DLS), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), fluorescence
spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy
measurements, to unveil their photophysical properties and the effect
of the molecular design of the nanoparticles. The in-depth characterization
of the new SPNs revealed that SPNs prepared from HA and polysorbate
80 exhibit fast kinetic decays of the excitons upon irradiation as
measured by TA spectroscopy. Interestingly, the incorporation of various
thiophene moieties or the utilization of HA of Tween 80 does not significantly
impact the photophysical properties, and the newly prepared nanoparticles
maintained the optical properties of their parent polymers (before
nanoprecipitation). Ultimately, the investigation and evaluation of
the new HA and polysorbate DPP-based SPNs can potentially enable the
fine-tuning of the optical properties of such materials, contributing
to the preparation new high-performance imaging and therapeutic platforms.

Results and Discussion
The three different DPP-based
conjugated polymers (Figure 2a), namely, P(DPP-T), P(DPP-2T),
and P(DPP-3T), were prepared
according to previous reports.38 Briefly, a decyltetradecyl-branched diketopyrrolopyrrole
monomer was copolymerized with different stannylated derivatives via
Stille polymerization. The resulting polymer was precipitated with
methanol, purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, and
hexane, collected with chloroform before being precipitated in methanol,
and dried under vacuum. As shown in Figures S1–S9, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopies were used to confirm the structure of the conjugated
polymers. Upon synthesis, the DPP-based polymers were characterized
by high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) to probe for
their molecular weight. As shown in Table S1, P(DPP-T), P(DPP-2T), and P(DPP-3T) showed a molecular weight of 13.7, 22.2, and 20.6 kDa, respectively,
with polydispersity indexes around 2. It is important to mention that
Carothers’ equation was used during polymerization in order
to limit the molecular weights, thus allowing for a better control
over the solubility of the polymers in the desired solvents used for
nanoprecipitation. Optical properties, energy levels, and decomposition
temperatures of P(DPP-T), P(DPP-2T), and P(DPP-3T) are also depicted in Table S1.

show Q-dependence of the sample scattering. I(Q) scattering curves were vertically
offset using scaling factors for clarity of presentation.

Following the synthesis of the semiconducting polymers,
preparation
of the SPNs was undertaken using commercially available hydrophilic
polymers HA and polysorbate 80 (Tween 80). The complete procedure
for nanoprecipitation is detailed in the Supporting Information. Upon addition of the various precursors to water
under sonication, rapid diffusion of the solvent and aqueous phase
leads to supersaturation of the polymer, thus forming nanoparticles
which are stabilized by the hydrophilic materials. Upon formation
of the SPNs, namely, NP(DPP-T), NP(DPP-T2), and NP(DPP-T3), the samples were purified through
successive washes with water and filtered using a 0.2 μm filter
to remove any large undispersed polymer aggregates. Importantly, all
nanoparticle suspensions in water shown good stability, up to a month
at 4 °C. However, as shown in Figure S10, the samples began to decompose after 2 weeks at ambient conditions,
confirmed by the appearance of smaller features observed by DLS.

The SPNs were first analyzed by DLS to probe for size distributions
and dispersity, and the results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2b,c. Interestingly, independently of the semiconducting
core, the SPNs showed relatively narrow size distribution with an
average size of 133 nm for NP(DPP-T), 150 nm for NP(DPP-2T), and 171 nm for NP(DPP-3T) when HA
was used as a stabilizing hydrophilic polymer. Similarly, an average
size of 89 nm for NP(DPP-T), 104 nm for NP(DPP-2T), and 79 nm for NP(DPP-3T) were observed when Tween
80 was used. These results show the relatively similar behavior of
the polymer in aqueous media, in terms of aggregation and stability.
To confirm their size and investigate the shape and morphology, SPNs
were subjected to SANS. All SPNs optimally modeled using a spherical
uniform scattering length density, with a sphere radius (Rs) which correlates with the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) determined from DLS (Table 1). The spherical shape and sizes of SPNs
are corroborated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the
results are summarized in Figure S11. The
SANS data further yielded the radius of gyration (Rg) of the SPNs, which appears invariable to the number
of thiophenes present in the polymer. Insight into the geometry of
the particles can be inferred from the Rg/Rh ratio, where Rg/Rh = 0.775 for hard spheres.39,40 The SPNs presented here yield Rg/Rh values 0.63–0.73 (polysorbate 80) and
0.41–0.53 (HA). These results support a spherical geometry,
as Rg/Rh values
> 0.775 are a result of rodlike and disklike geometries, and values
<0.775 have been associated with spherical particles that possess
long-range interactions and aggregation in solution.40,41Q-dependence analysis of the SANS data shows that
the number of thiophenes and surfactants used can influence the SPN
structure and shape (Figures 2d,e and S12). SPNs formed with
HA consistently follows a power law of ∼Q–4, which typically describes a compact, spherical particle
with sharp interfaces. For SPNs with Tween 80, changes in scattering
intensity in the low Q region occur depending on
thiophene units. This may be due to a difference in aggregative behavior
or may occur when SPN micellar shape shifts from rodlike (Q–1) to lamellar or disklike (Q–2), and vice versa. The mid Q-dependence of Q–2 found
in all three SPNs with Tween 80 is also indicative of markedly flexible
micelles.42

Based on the results from SANS and DLS, all SPN samples,
independent
of the stabilizing hydrophilic polymer, were shown to be composed
of spherical nanoparticles averaging 100–200 nm in diameter.
Interestingly, for the SPNs prepared from Tween 80, the addition of
thiophene moieties in the π-conjugated backbone led to a smaller
size distribution in the resulting NPs. This can be potentially explained
by an increased aggregation for P(DPP-T) in solution,
which is supported by a low Rg/Rh ratio. For the NPs prepared from HA, the particles
were observed to generate more bundles than from the samples prepared
from Tween 80. Despite slight difference in sizes depending on the
structure of the polymer, all particles were shown to be around the
same diameters and shapes. It is important to mention that nanoprecipitation
was also attempted using a 1:4 hydrophilic polymer/conjugated polymer
ratio, and the size distribution was investigated by DLS to probe
for the influence of surfactant/semiconducting polymer ratios on the
final nanoparticles. Interestingly, the NPs prepared with a 1:4 ratio
resulted in very similar average size distributions than the NPs prepared
with a 1:2 ratio, as shown in Figure S13.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations by Gaussian
09 were
also performed on P(DPP-T), P(DPP-2T), and P(DPP-3T), and the results are summarized in Figure S14. This analysis allowed for gaining insights into
the backbone conformation upon extension of the π-conjugation
induced by the addition of thiophene units. After geometry optimization,
a two-coordinate potential energy scan of dihedral angles was performed
in order to do a conformational search on the most stable configuration.
Based on the resulting potential energy scans, the most stable conformation
for all three polymers is when the polymer backbone is completely
planar, which has been observed for similar π-conjugated polymer
systems.43 This result suggests that the
addition of thiophene units has a moderate conformational influence
on the π-conjugated backbone.

Evaluation of the optical
properties of the DPP-based polymers
before and after formation of nanoparticles was performed by UV–vis
spectroscopy, and the results are shown in Figures 3a. As expected, the three polymer samples
showed characteristic absorption bands for push–pull conjugated
polymers, with a strong absorption band centered at around 700 nm.
Interestingly, the extension of the π-conjugation through the
addition of thiophene units resulted in a slight hypsochromic shift
of the principal absorption band, which was observed for both solution
and thin-film analysis (Figures S15 and S16). As also observed in Figure S15, the
relative intensities of the 0–0 and 0–1 absorption bands
are changed upon π-conjugation extension, which can be directly
associated with the formation of H-type aggregates.44,45 As previously observed for similar systems, both the hypsochromic
shift of the absorption at λ = 700 nm and differences in the
intensities of the 0–0 and 0–1 absorption bands with
increasing thiophene chain length can be associated with an increased
flexibility of the polymer backbone as thiophene units are added,
resulting in a possible reduction in the effective conjugation length
and reduced J-aggregation.46 More importantly,
similar trends are observed for the conjugated polymer nanoparticles
prepared using HA and Tween 80 (Figure 3a) as surfactants. For the nanoparticle solutions,
the intensity of the 0–1 absorption band was found to be systematically
higher than the intensity of the 0–0 absorption band, which
also suggests the formation of H-type aggregates in the SPNs. Despite
the fact that no significant spectral shifting was observed before
and after nanoprecipitation, the important increase in 0–1
absorption band intensity after the nanoprecipitation process can
be associated with a general reduction in J-aggregation and the formation
of H-type aggregates as the nanoparticles are formed. Importantly,
the UV–vis spectra show very little difference between nanoparticles
formed from HA and Tween 80, which suggests that the surfactant does
not play a strong role in the molecular organization of the DPP-based
polymers during nanoparticle formation.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis absorption
spectra of DPP-based polymers in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) solution before and after nanoprecipitation with HA and Tween
80 and (b) variable temperature UV–vis (VT–UV–vis)
spectra of the conjugated polymers in chlorobenzene. Spectra are obtained
by slowly cooling solutions from their maximum temperature in a controlled
manner.

Further UV–vis experiments were performed
to probe for the
influence of the π-conjugation length on the aggregation of
the polymers and nanoparticles in solution. The concept of H- and
J-type aggregation was designed to explain the spectroscopic observations
in small molecules with excitons that are Frenkel-like. In conjugated
polymers, the individual monomers are chemically tethered to each
other, resulting in an inherent J-type interaction;47 furthermore, polymer chains can stack on top of each other,
resulting in an H-type interaction. Therefore, when considering the
photophysics of a conjugated polymer, one must consider aggregates
with a dual HJ nature.48 Consequently,
an understanding of this dual HJ aggregation can lead to a further
understanding of the bandwidth and coherence length of generated excitons.
One way to determine whether a polymer aggregate is H- or J-dominant
is to examine the relative intensities of the 0–0 and 0–1
absorption bands.49,50 If the 0–0/0–1
ratio (A0–0/A0–1) is greater than 1, the polymer HJ aggregates are
dominated by intrachain J aggregation, where as if A0–0/A0–1 is
less than 1, the HJ polymer aggregate is dominated by interchain H
aggregations. Therefore, in order to probe the aggregation of the
investigated polymers in solution, the polymers were dissolved in
chlorobenzene and heated to a temperature between 70 and 80 °C.
The absorption spectrum of the polymers was then recorded under controlled
cooling of the samples, such that the UV–vis absorption was
recoded every 5 °C. The results of this experiment are summarized
in Figure 3b and Table S2. When the polymer solutions are heated,
the absorption spectra for all polymers are blue-shifted and the intensity
of the 0–1 absorption band becomes higher than the 0–0
absorption band. As the solutions are then cooled, the spectra underwent
a red shift and the relative intensities of the vibronic bands are
reversed, resulting in a more intense 0–0 absorption at low
temperature. The relative peak intensities as a function of temperature
are detailed in Figure S17. This observation
confirms that the polymers are aggregated in solution and that H-type
(interchain) aggregation is favored as the temperature increases.
As expected, as the solutions are cooled, the polymers rearrange again
to form aggregates that favor J-type (intrachain) interactions. This
phenomenon has been reported for other π-conjugated systems,
such as poly(3-hexylthiophene).43,51 Furthermore, no indication
of polymer degradation was noted throughout the experiment, indicating
that the polymers exhibit a good thermal stability in solution. A
similar experiment was carried out on a solution of NP(DPP-T), where, interestingly, no spectral shift or change in relative band
intensity was noted (see Figure S18). This
again confirms that the SPN dispersions are stable at high temperature
and furthermore shows that the polymer chains are tightly aggregated
in the nanoparticle, making it such that they are not able to rearrange
upon heating.

As previously observed for similar conjugated
polymer systems, P(DPP-T), P(DPP-2T), and P(DPP-3T) were found to be nonluminescent in THF solution.52 Therefore, because of this lack of emission,
TA spectroscopy
in THF was required to determine the excited-state lifetimes and kinetics
of the polymers before and after nanoprecipitation. As detailed in
the Supporting Information, the samples
were excited with the fundamental output of the Ti-sapphire laser
at 795 nm and were probed using a white light continuum generated
by passing the 795 nm pulse through a sapphire window. Given the broad
absorption range of the new materials, three separate spectral windows
were evaluated when possible. The TA results are summarized in Figure 4 and are detailed
in Figures S19–S22 for polymer solutions
in THF and Figures S23–S28 for SPN
solutions. Overall, the measured TA spectra for all polymers before
nanoprecipitation are similar to those which have been previously
reported for other π-conjugated DPP-based polymers.53 The UV spectral window (350–590 nm) revealed
a ground-state bleach signal corresponding to the high energy absorption
band (Figure 3) assigned
to the aromatic thiophene units. A small photoinduced absorption signal
can also be observed, which can be assigned to the S0 → Sn absorption of the thiophene units. The visible light (VIS) window
(530–770 nm) showed the ground-state bleach signal corresponding
to the blue edge of the DPP absorption (Figure 3). The NIR window (860–1100 or 925–1100
nm) showed the red edge of the ground-state bleach and a broad photoinduced
absorption band corresponding to the S0 → Sn absorption
of the excited state. As the ground-state absorption shifts to blue
with an increasing amount of thiophene units in the π-conjugated
backbone, the ground-state bleach is also shifted, making it more
apparent in the VIS window and less apparent in the NIR window as
expected from steady-state measurements.

traces from fs-TA measurements of (a) P(DPP-T) (left), P(DPP-2T) (middle), and P(DPP-3T) (right) in
THF solution (select traced from the
UV, VIS, and NIR windows are shown); (b) NP(DPP-T) (left), NP(DPP-2T) (middle), and NP(DPP-3T) (right) prepared
from Tween 80 (select traced from the UV, VIS, and NIR windows are
shown); and (c) normalized decay traces showing ground-state recovery
of the polymers in THF solution and of the nanoparticles prepared
from TWEEN and HA. All measurements made with a 795 nm excitation.

When we examine the TA spectra in THF, we see that
the ground-state
bleach and the excited-state absorptions all relax with the same kinetics,
suggesting that no intermediate excited states are formed between
excitation and the time required to return to the ground state. To
adequately fit the measured data, three to four exponential decay
constants were applied. The very rapid (fs) relaxations are assigned
to the relaxation of the vibronic states. The long-lifetime components
are assigned a lifetime of several nanoseconds (note that the delay
line has a limit of 8 ns) and are assigned to a weak population of
the triplet state. Finally, the dominant lifetime components are ps-lifetime
components that are observed in all three spectral windows. These
dominant lifetime components are assigned the excited-state lifetime
of the polymers in THF solution at room temperature. Normalized decay
traces for each of the polymers are provided in Figure 4a, and the lifetime values are summarized
in Tables 2 and S3 and S4. The TA maps as well as spectral slices
and additional decay traces are provided in the Supporting Information.

When we examine the TA spectra of P(DPP-T), we are
able to extract excited-state lifetimes of 20.4, 25.3, and 21.2 ps
in the UV, VIS, and NIR windows, respectively (Table S3), leading to an average measured excited-state lifetime
of 22.3 ps. Decay traces (Figures 4a and S22) showing the decay
of the excited-state absorption intensity and the ground-state recovery
all appear to have similar profiles and are clearly dominated by a
∼20 ps lifetime component. The rapid loss of intensity in the
first few picoseconds after photoexcitation, which can be seen in
the 400 and 537 nm kinetic slices (Figure S19), is associated with the rapid vibronic relaxation that occurs on
a femtosecond time scale. This rapid relaxation is less apparent in
the 741, 865, and 1003 nm slices but is still present after deconvolution.
The decay of the excited-state absorptions and the recovery of the
ground-state bleach show nearly identical kinetics, and the absence
of new transient signals or the presence of a rise time indicate that
no intermediate excited-state species are formed after photoexcitation.
The lack of these features and the short excited-state lifetime further
suggests a tightly bound electron–hole pair, which rapidly
recombines, which is supported by the short conjugation length (approximately
three units) that has been reported for a similar structure.52

After nanoprecipitation of P(DPP-T) to form an aqueous
dispersion of NP(DPP-T) that is stabilized by Tween 80
and HA, the excited-state relaxation behavior was found to be relatively
unchanged compared to that observed in THF solution. Because of the
limitation in signal intensity, the probing of the UV window was found
to be particularly challenging. However, a sufficient signal intensity
for the measurement of the VIS and NIR windows was possible, which
allowed for the observation of the blue edge of the DPP absorption
(ground-state bleach) and the photoinduced absorption of the excited
state, respectively. Once again, no intermediate excited states were
found, which suggests that there is no charge separation or formation
of new species in the excited stare of the nanoparticles. Select decay
traces for the nanoparticle relaxation are shown in Figure 4b. The dominant lifetime for NP(DPP-T) prepared in Tween 80 was determined to be 26.2 and
17.9 ps in the VIS and NIR window, while the lifetime of the nanoparticles
prepared in HA was measured to be 20.1 ps. Decay traces for the ground-state
recovery of the nanoparticles prepared from Tween 80 and HA and the
corresponding polymer in THF solution are shown in Figure 4c. Interestingly, NP(DPP-T) showed a recovery of the ground-state bleach at a faster overall
rate than the native polymer in THF. Deconvolution shows, however,
that this is due to an increased contribution of the rapid vibrational
relaxation pathways, explained by the tight aggregation of the polymers
in the nanoparticle which are able to knock against each other, leading
to an increased contribution from the rapid vibrational relaxation
pathways. Importantly, the relaxation kinetics of the nanoparticles
formed from Tween 80 and HA are nearly identical, which once again
suggests that the surfactant does not play an important role in the
molecular organization and photophysical behavior of the nanoparticles.
It is important to mention that, similar to the conjugated polymers
before nanoprecipitation, nanoparticle solutions were found to be
nonemissive, which can most likely be attributed to a quenching phenomenon
caused by molecular aggregation.

A similar investigation was
performed for P(DPP-2T), which shows that there is a
larger contribution from the fast fs-decay
that is associated with the vibrational relaxation of the excited
states. This can likely be associated with an increased flexibility
of the polymer chain. The decay of the photoinduced absorption signal
in the NIR and the recovery of the ground-state bleach are largely
dominated by lifetimes of 30.4 and 30.0 ps (average 30.2 ps), respectively.
Interestingly, the UV window showed slightly different kinetics. In
this window, the relaxation was found to be dominated by the 131 fs
lifetime component, although there are also significant contributions
of the 893 and 18.5 ps components (Figure S20 and Table S3). This very rapid relaxation
is most likely due to the rapid vibrational relaxation of the oligothiophene
linker. This rapid relaxation does not appear to be associated with
any kind of rise in the photoinduced absorption signal of the DPP
units, suggesting that the increased relaxation is not associated
with energy transfer to the DPP centers. As observed for P(DPP-T), the nanoprecipitation of P(DPP-2T) to generate NP(DPP-2T) did not significantly influence the shape of the
TA spectrum. Analysis of the NP(DPP-2T) solutions yields
excited-state lifetimes of 23.2 ps (VIS window) and 27.5 ps (NIR window)
in Tween 80 and 20.6 ps in HA, which compares favorably with the lifetime
of 30.0 ps that was obtained in THF solution (Table 1). Once again, Figure 4b shows the ground-state recovery and the
excited-state decay of the nanoparticle solution prepared in Tween
80, while Figure 4c
shows a comparison of the excited-state relaxation between the polymer
in THF solution and the nanoparticles. Examination of the TA results
for P(DPP-3T) yields similar results. The average lifetime
of the polymer in THF solution was determined to be 36.7 ps. After
nanoprecipitation, an average lifetime of 34.3 ps is obtained for
nanoparticles prepared from Tween, and a lifetime of 29.1 ps was obtained
when HA is used. Overall, as we increase the number of thiophene units
between DPP units in the π-conjugated backbone, the number of
possible conformations of the polymer is increased, as well as the
number of vibronic modes that are available. It is important to note
that, in TA measurements, the fast relaxation associated with the
rapid vibronic relaxation of the thiophene bridge changes drastically
as the length of conjugation increases. These results show that the
photophysical behavior of the DPP-oligothiophene polymers is not greatly
affected by the formation of nanoparticles nor is it affected by the
surfactant used to prepare the nanoparticles, indicating that solution-based
analysis of conjugated polymers can yield results that will help to
predict the behavior of their corresponding nanoparticle solutions.

Conclusions
In conclusion, new SPNs were prepared from
a diketopyrrolopyrrole-based
conjugated polymer and HA or polysorbate 80 by using nanoprecipitation.
Conjugated polymers with different numbers of thiophene moieties in
the π-conjugated backbone were used in order to probe for the
influence of π-conjugation length on the formation, size, and
photophysical properties of the new semiconducting polymers. Based
on the results obtained from DLS, SANS, and TEM, spherical nanoparticles
with average diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm were obtained, independently
of the π-conjugation length or stabilizing polymer. UV–visible
and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that all the new nanoparticle
samples possess similar optical properties, with maximal absorption
in the NIR. Moreover, TA spectroscopy was used to evaluate the excited-state
dynamics before and after nanoprecipitation. Interestingly, all nanoparticles,
independently of the stabilizing polymer used or of the π-conjugation
length, showed very fast relaxation, and the relaxation kinetics of
the nanoparticles formed from Tween 80 and HA were found to be nearly
identical, which suggests that the surfactant does not play an important
role in the molecular organization and photophysical behavior of the
nanoparticles. Based on the results obtained, HA and polysorbate 80
are two efficient stabilizing agents for nanoprecipitation, leading
to new nanoparticles with good optical properties. Moreover, the absence
of a significant influence of the stabilizing polymer on the photophysical
properties after nanoprecipitation confirms that the system is mostly
depending on the properties of the parent conjugated polymer. With
absorption in the NIR wavelengths, optimal photophysical properties,
and good stability as dispersions, the new SPNs are promising candidates
for various applications, including as bioimaging agents. Moreover,
the in-depth characterization of the photophysical properties opens
new opportunities for the design of novel SPNs with new properties.

Experimental Section
Materials
Chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. Canada, Matrix Scientific, or Oakwood Products Inc., and were
used as received. Solvents used for organic synthesis were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich and purified with a solvent purifier system (Swagelok,
Solon, Ohio, USA). Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)-chloroform
adduct (Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and recrystallized following a reported
procedure.35−37 Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. HA sodium was purchased from
LKT Laboratories and used without further purification. D2O (99.9% purity) was purchased from Cambridge Isotopes.

Measurements and Characterization
DLS measurements
were obtained using a Zetasizer Nano ZS utilizing a He–Ne laser
at a wavelength of 633 nm and a power of 100VA at 25 °C. TEM
images were taken on a Hitachi HT7700. Samples prepared for molecular
weight analysis were analyzed using an HLC-8321GPC/HT (high-temperature)
instrument. The samples were prepared using 1 mg/mL of polymer sample
in trichlorobenzene and were allowed to stir at 80 °C for 12
h prior to injection. The sample analysis was performed at 180 °C
with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with injection quantities of 300 μL
per sample. The data were collected and integrated using EcoSEC 8321GPC/HT
software suite.

SANS measurements were conducted on the EQSANS
instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN). Measurements were recorded at 37 °C
using a single instrument configuration: a frame-skipping mode with
instrument choppers running at 30 Hz, a sample-to-detector distance
of 3.5 m, and a minimal wavelength of 2 Å. This configuration
yielded a Q-range of ∼0.006 to 0.4 Å–1. Data were treated using Mantid software.5 In brief, data were calibrated to an absolute
scale using a porasil standard. The data were also corrected for detector
sensitivity, sample transmission, and background to yield the final I(Q) scattering curves. SANS data were
analyzed using the openly available SASView (http://www.sasview.org/) using
the P(r) inversion tool that calculates
a real-space distance distribution function, P(r), to determine the radius of gyration (Rg). The particle form factor was modeled using a sphere
with uniform scattering length density. In the case of the polysorbate
80 surfactant, two sphere populations were required, and the surfactant
micelle form factor was accounted for prior to determining Rg. The absorption measurements were made on
an Agilent Technologies 8453 Diode Array UV–vis spectrometer,
with a spectral resolution of 1 nm in a 1 cm quartz cuvette. The fs
transient spectra were acquired on a homemade system using a Soltice/OPA-800CF
(Spectra Physics) Ti-sapphire laser. Excitation was carried out using
the fundamental output of the laser (λexc = 795 nm,
rep. rate = 500 Hz; and spot size ≈ 500 μm). The white
light continuum (probe) is generated inside a sapphire window and
a custom-made dual CCD camera of 64 × 1024 pixels sensitive between
200 and 1100 nm (S7030, spectronic devices) is used for detection.
The delay line permitted to probe up to 8 ns with an accuracy of ∼4
fs. The results were analyzed with the program Glotaran (http://glotaran.org) permitting to
extract a sum of independent exponentials  that fits the whole three-dimensional transient
map. Compactional analysis of the different polymers was performed
by DFT; all geometries were fully optimized by using the M06-2X functional
in conjunction with a 6-311G basis set, and the scan calculations
were performed using the opt = ModRedundant with Gaussian 09 program
package.6 Cyclic voltammetry measurements
were carried out using a CHIode three-electrode electrochemical setup
utilizing a glassy carbon working electrode, a silver/silver chloride
reference electrode, and a platinum wire counter electrode in an anhydrous
acetonitrile solvent. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker NMR spectrometers
(DPX 300 and DPX 300 US operating at 300 MHz (1H) and 75
MHz (13C)). UV–vis spectroscopy was performed on
a Varian UV/visible Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Thermal gravimetric
analysis was performed on a Mettler Toledo TGA SDTA 851e. Nitrogen
(99.999%) was used to purge the systems at a flow rate of 60 mL/min.
All samples were run in aluminum crucibles. TGA samples were held
at 25 °C for 30 min before heated to 550 °C at a rate of
5 °C/min. FTIR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker ALPHA FTIR
Spectrometer using a Platinum ATR sampling module.

Nanoparticle Preparation by Nanoprecipitation
Selected
conjugated polymer (1 mg) and 2 mg of the selected surfactant were
dissolved in 1 mL of THF and left to stir for 30 min. The solution
was then injected in 9 mL of deionized water under probe sonication
(amplitude of 60, power of 55 W for 2 min). After sonication, the
sample was passed through a 0.2 μm PTFE (hydrophobic) syringe
filter to remove any large aggregated materials. The nanoparticles
were washed multiple times with deionized water and the dispersions
were stored at 4 °C prior to use.
