By
using pulse electrodeposition, a copper nanopillar array (CuNPA)
was filled into porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) films to achieve
a highly thermal conductive interconnector with anisotropic property.
After 120 min pulse deposition, CuNPA uniformly filled the pores of
AAO with a pore-filling percentage of 99.4%, as the ion concentration
in AAO pores can re-equilibrate to electrolyte concentration during
the current-off period. The CuNPA-filled AAO film showed a high thermal
conductivity of 153.12 W/(m·K) in the vertical direction and
a low thermal conductivity of 3.43 W/(m·K) in the horizontal
direction. Hence, the anisotropic ratio of the thermal conductivity
reached 44.64. Moreover, the fabrication process was facile and cost-effective,
showing a potential application prospect in the field of high-density
packages and power electronic devices.

Introduction
With rapid development of electronic packaging
technologies and
increasing pitch densities in next-generation electronics, heat transmission
has become a critical factor that affects the performance and reliability
of electronic devices.1,2 In addition, coefficient of thermal
expansion (CTE) mismatches among the packaging materials lead to cracking
and delamination of chips during temperature cycling in fabrication
or working.3,4 To address these issues, anisotropic conductive
adhesive (ACA) is applied in fine-pitch and high-power electronics,
which have been considered as potential replacements for solder interconnections,
as they exhibit thermal and electrical conductivities only in vertical
or horizontal direction for anisotropic interconnections.5,6

However, thermal conductivity of the adhesive [varying from
3 to
12 W/(m·K)] was far lower than that of metal materials.5−8 To enhance their thermal and electrical performances, fillers such
as Ag, Au, and graphene were added into ACA at the expense of high
cost and complex fabrication processes.9,10 More essentially,
the base materials of ACA were mostly organics and, thus, they were
unstable under high temperature, causing mechanical performance degradation
over time. Hence, more efficient and stable heat dissipation materials
are required when electronic devices, especially for power devices,
are assembled on substrates.11,12 Copper (Cu) is an outstanding
thermal and electrical conductor and is vastly used in electronic
packaging, but it is hard to achieve the anisotropic interconnection
due to its isotropic conductivities. Anodized aluminum oxide (AAO)
films are aluminum-based materials composing with an individual cylindrical
channel array with high hardness,13 and
they are a kind of excellent dielectric materials with dielectric
constant ∼4.5 varying from 10 to 20 GHz.14 Moreover, the CTE of AAO is 5.4 ppm/K, and it is capable
with Si (2.5 ppm/K). Nevertheless, the AAO films were usually used
as a template for synthesis of various nanowires and nanotubes, and
will be etched out after electrodeposition.15,16 Considering the complementary advantages of copper and AAO films,
it is believed that the Cu-filled AAO possesses the merits of both
components and will be used in the electronic package field as an
excellent anisotropic interconnector.

In this work, a copper
nanopillar array (CuNPA)-filled AAO film
was achieved for electronic interconnection. The different growth
mechanism of CuNPA between constant current (CC) and pulse deposition
was explained. By tuning parameters of electrodeposition processes,
the Cu nanopillars uniformly filled the AAO film. Compared with conductive
adhesive, the film showed superior anisotropic thermal conductivity.
Besides, the CuNPA-filled AAO film can also provide electrical and
thermal tunnels with a fine pitch in the nanoscale for high-density
electronic devices. Moreover, a reflow soldering process was employed
to connect the film with the Cu substrate using Sn63Pb37, demonstrating
its compatibility with the traditional electronic packaging process.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a illustrates
the electroplating process and structures of the CuNPA-filled AAO
film. The AAO film with a sputtered Cu layer was employed as a template
and a cathode. During the depositing process, CuNPA forms a CuNPA-filled
AAO structure. In this structure, the AAO film provided dielectric
performance and a supporting frame in the horizontal direction, and
the CuNPA worked as electrical and thermal tunnels for vertical interconnection. Figure 1b,c shows the top
morphology of AAO before and after electrodeposition, respectively.
After deposition for 120 min, CuNPA uniformly filled the pores of
AAO in the pulse mode with an on/off time of 20 ms/20 ms. The cross-section
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 1d,e) confirmed that CuNPA grew through the
pores of the AAO without breaks, and the vertical nanopillar array
was produced by removing AAO as shown in the inset image of Figure 1d. Apparently, the
uniformity was essential to the CuNPA-filled AAO film for high-density
devices and power devices, in which field the electrical and thermal
performances were critical.

image of (d) shows CuNPA without AAO, and its scale bar is 5 μm.

To investigate the filling and
growth mechanism of the CuNPA-filled
AAO film, a serial of experiments with different deposition parameters
were introduced. In the pulse mode, the current on time (ton) was actual Cu deposition time, and Figure 2 exhibits the height of Cu
nanopillars as a function of ton. According
to Faraday’s laws, the height of the Cu pillar (H, μm) was proportional to the product of current density (j, A/dm2) and ton (h), as follows 1  where k is the electrochemical
equivalent of Cu2+ for 1.186 g/(A h), ρCu is the density of Cu (8.9 g/cm3), and P is the porosity of AAO for 41%. The real height of the Cu nanopillar
was coincident with theoretical calculation in the initial 50 min
electroplating time. After that, the actual height was far shorter
than the calculating value, especially for samples in the CC mode.

Figure 2 Height
of Cu pillars as a function of electroplating time.

Figure 3 shows the
overpotential of AAO as a function of total electroplating time. Considering
the growth process of Cu pillars and changes of its overpotential,
the deposition process could be divided into four stages.17,18 In the beginning, an electric double layer was formed, and a diffusion
layer was created in the pores of AAO (I). After an initial Cu layer
formed, Cu pillars began to grow in AAO. During this step, the overpotential
remains constant (II). Because of overgrowth of Cu, the overpotential
was decreasing when some pillars grew out of the AAO surface (III).
Finally, the AAO surface covered by Cu, and the overpotential kept
almost stable indicating that the growth process of Cu pillars was
finished (IV). According to Figure 3a,b, the short constant time of stage II and a relatively
long time in stage III of CC mode might be the reason for the significant
difference with the theoretical value.

Figure 3 Overpotential of the
CuNPA-filled AAO film as a function of total
electroplating time for (a) CC and (b) 20 ms/20 ms pulse electroplating,
respectively.

In the CC mode, Cu ions
maintain at a state of depletion in the
AAO pores, and their growth rate is limited by ion diffusion along
the height of the pores.19 Hence, the pillars
closer to the bulk electrolyte grow faster. Then, the unbalance growth
between the pillars at the initial stage would intensify during deposition,
leading to the short constant time of stage II. In an extreme situation,
early formed Cu can quickly cover the AAO surface without concentration
limitation and block the growth of Cu pillars in AAO pores. Figure 4a–c shows
side-view SEM images of the CuNPA-filled AAO film depositing at 1
A/dm2 for 25, 75, and 120 min, respectively. As shown in
the inset image of Figure 4c, there is a noticeable shortage of Cu pillars upon where
the Cu bulk presented. Though it has been reported in our previous
research that low current density can alleviate the unbalanced growth
of the pillars as the Cu diffusion rate can keep up with the electrodeposition
rate at this status;20 meanwhile, the plating
time is remarkably extended. Besides, considering that the overpotential
is proportional with the current density, to reach the needed overpotential
threshold, there is a minimum current density to trigger the deposition
process. Thus, the pulse mode is applied to realize the Cu balance
deposition in AAO pores.

Figure 4 (a–c) are side-view images of the CuNPA-filled
AAO film
after 25, 75, and 120 min using CC electroplating at 1 A/dm2, respectively. (d–f) are side-view images of the CuNPA-filled
AAO film after 36, 110, and 125 min using 20 ms/20 ms pulse electroplating
at 2 A/dm2, respectively. The inset images in figures are
zoomed-in side views of the top zone.

In the pulse mode, the ion concentration in AAO pores re-equilibrated
to the electrolyte concentration during toff period,21 and the unbalanced growth was
restrained between pulses. Moreover, the current density can maintain
relative higher reaching a shorter fabrication time. In 30 s/10 s
pulse mode, ton was relatively long, and
the filling process was similar with the CC mode, as shown in Figure 2. To fill the pores
completely, it is necessary to achieve a consistent growth rate in
the pores. When the ton/toff ratio tuned to 30 ms/10 ms pulse mode, the height
of the Cu pillar was closer to theoretical data, indicating the uniform
growth of CuNPAs, but it needs longer time to fill the whole pores
of the AAO film. In 20 ms/20 ms fast pulse mode, Cu pillars grew uniformly
after depositing for 36 min (Figure 4d) and 110 min (Figure 4e). After 125 min deposition, the entire AAO was filled
with Cu nanopillars forming a high-quality CuNPA-filled AAO film as
shown in Figure 4f.

After deposition, thermal conductivities of the CuNPA-filled AAO
film in vertical and horizontal directions were measured and calculated
by the following equations22,23 2   3  where
λv and λh are thermal conductivities
of the CuNPA-filled AAO film in
vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. ρfilm is the density of the CuNPA-filled AAO film, and Cp is the specific heat capacity of the
film at room temperature. av and ah are measured thermal diffusivity of the CuNPA-filled
AAO film in vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. ρfilm of the film was measured to be
4.9 g/cm3 by the Archimedes principle, which was usually
employed for the density measurement of composite materials.24,25 The Cp was 673 J/(kg·K)
evaluated from the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The av (46.43 ± 3.99 × 10–6 m2/s) and ah (1.04 ±
0.41 × 10–6 m2/s) were measured
by a laser flash apparatus, and the measurement was repeated five
times. According to eqs 2 and 3, the thermal conductivities of the CuNPA-filled
AAO film at room temperature were 153.12 ± 13.16 W/(m·K)
and 3.43 ± 1.35 W/(m·K) in vertical and horizontal directions,
respectively, exhibited its superior thermal performance with an anisotropic
character. Figure 5 shows thermal conductivities of various materials for electronic
packaging. The thermal conductivities of AAO were only 2 W/(m·K).
After filling with CuNPA, the thermal performance was improved vastly
in the vertical direction, and the thermal resistance performance
remained in the horizontal direction. Hence, the anisotropic ratio
of the thermal conductivity reached 44.64. Meanwhile, the CuNPA-filled
AAO film exhibited a superior thermal performance in the vertical
direction compared with conductive adhesive [∼12 W/(m·K)]5 and even higher than Si [149 W/(m·K)].

Figure 6a
indicates
the top-view SEM image of the mechanically polished CuNPA-filled AAO
film. Pore-filling percentage of CuNPA is measured using Photoshop
software, and it reaches 99.4%. The polished film is reflow soldered
with a Cu substrate using Sn63Pb37 at 220 °C for 5 min. Figure 6b illustrates the
cross-sectional images of the soldering interface, and there are not
any obvious holes or cracks indicating a tight connection between
the film and the pastes. Moreover, element distributions from the
corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping (Figure 6c) of Figure 6b also indicate the status
of connection. Figure 6d shows that Cu elements are diffused into Sn63Pb37, and Sn and Pb
are also detected in the Sn63Pb37/CuNPA-filled AAO film interface
forming an interdiffused layer with a thickness of 3 μm. The
presence of the interdiffused layer confirms the effective connection
that is similar to the interface of the Sn63Pb37/Cu-substrate.

Conclusions
In this work, we fabricated the CuNPA-filled
AAO film for electronic
interconnection successfully using the pulse electrodeposition method.
For fast pulse mode deposition, Cu ions could uniformly diffuse into
AAO pores during the toff period, and
CuNPA could fill the pores of AAO in the ton period. In the film, AAO provided dielectric and adiabatic performances
and CuNPA provided the high-density electronic interconnection through
the nanosize tunnels. The film showed superior thermal conductivity
than the traditional conductive adhesives. In addition, the film was
successfully soldered with the Cu substrate, indicating its compatibility
with the packaging process of high-density electronic devices and
power devices.

Methods
Fabrication of CuNPA-Filled
AAO Films by Electrodeposition
A commercial AAO film with
an average thickness of 50 μm,
and pores in 75 nm diameter (Shenzhen Tuopu Jingmi Ltd., China) was
used as the template and substrate. To provide a conductive contact,
a layer of dense copper was coated on one side of the AAO film using
a magnetron sputtering equipment (Shenyang Bluesky Technology Ltd.,
China). Then, the AAO film was fixed onto indium tin oxide conductive
glass sealed by waterproof glue as a cathode. A copper plate was washed
by 1 mol/L H2SO4 and employed as an anode. The
electrochemical experiments were performed by the chronopotentiometry
method (CHI-660E, CH Instruments, Inc., USA), and the Hg(s)/Hg2SO4(aq)/SO42–(aq)
was set as a reference electrode. During electroplating, the temperature
of the electrolyte (mixed by 1.5 mol/L CuSO4·5H2O and 1.5 mol/L H2SO4) was maintained
at 30 °C in a thermostatically controlled water bath.

Reflow
Soldering Process of CuNPA-Filled AAO Films
The as-prepared
CuNPA-filled AAO film was polished using a mechanical
polishing machine (UNIPOL-820, MTI Ltd., China). Then, the commercial
solder paste, Sn63Pb37 (Senju Solnet Metal Co., Ltd., China), was
coated on the polished side of the film, and a prepolished Cu substrate
was placed on the paste forming a CuNPA-filled AAO film/Sn63Pb37/Cu-substrate
sandwich structure. Finally, the sample was heated in a reflow oven
(Falcon 5C, Sikama, USA) at 220 °C for 5 min.

Characterization
The morphologies of the CuNPA-filled
AAO film were characterized using SEM (MERLIN Compact, ZEISS, Germany)
with an EDX module (X-Max Extreme, Oxford, UK). The thermal conductivity
was measured by DSC (STA449F, Netzsch, Germany) and a laser flash
apparatus (LFA447, Netzsch, Germany).
