Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent
contaminants and concern has arisen over co-exposure of organisms
when the chemicals exist in mixtures. Herein, attenuated total reflection
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify biochemical
alterations induced in cells by single and binary mixtures of these
environmental chemicals. It was also investigated as a method to identify
if interactions are occurring in mixtures and as a possible tool to
predict mixture effects. Mallard fibroblasts were treated with single
and binary mixtures of B[a]P, PCB126, PCB153, BDE47,
and BDE209. Comparison of observed spectra from cells treated with
binary mixtures with expected additive spectra, which were created
from individual exposure spectra, indicated that in many areas of
the spectrum, less-than-additive binary mixture effects may occur.
However, possible greater-than-additive alterations were identified
in the 1650–1750 cm–1 lipid region and may
demonstrate a common mechanism of B[a]P and PCBs
or PBDEs, which can enhance toxicity in mixtures.

Introduction
There are many types
of chemical contaminants that find their way
into environmental compartments during their usage cycle or through
accidental release. The past century has seen an increasing awareness
of the potential risk such chemicals pose to the health of ecosystems
and environmental organisms. Some pollutants are extremely persistent
and bioaccumulate up food chains, giving rise to concern for top-level
predators, such as predatory bird species.1 Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is an example
of a pervasive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminant that
is abundantly found in the environment due to anthropogenic activity
associated with partial combustion. B[a]P exposure
has been largely associated with inhalation of cigarette smoke, car
exhaust, and industrial air pollution as well as via dietary intake.2,3 Exposure to B[a]P and other PAHs is considered
a risk to humans and wildlife due to reported carcinogenic toxicity.
B[a]P can bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)
and mediate the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A1,
which metabolizes the chemical into its DNA binding, mutagenic form.4,5 Other highly persistent chemicals include polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), some congeners
of which are also reported to possess AhR-binding abilities like B[a]P.6,7 PCBs and PBDEs have been used
as additives in various consumer products, such as paints, textiles,
and electronics, to act as coolants and flame retardants.8 They have been found to exert toxicity on a number
of biological systems, including the endocrine, immune, and nervous
systems.9,10 Although PCBs and many PBDE congeners are
now banned in the EU and other locations, they are still currently
found in environmental matrices due to their persistent nature and
are presently used in some developing countries.11−13

The concern
related to these contaminants is not only due to their
potential toxicities, but also due to the possibility that they exist
as part of mixtures. Chemicals are often considered in isolation,
but in reality, organisms in the environment are simultaneously and
sequentially exposed to a wide range of contaminants, many of which
have different toxic mechanisms. It is commonly assumed that the toxicity
of a mixture can be predicted by adding the toxicities of the mixture
components together, in what is known as an additive model of mixture
effects.14,15 Although this leads to accurate mixture
toxicity predictions in most instances, interactions may occur at
the biological target sites or between chemicals, which can cause
unexpected mixture toxicity. Interactions can lead to two possible
outcomes, a reduction in expected toxicity (antagonism) or a greater-than-expected
toxicity (synergism).16 The additive approach
is used for the majority of regulatory assessments regarding mixtures,
meaning that environmental organisms may be left vulnerable to the
effects of interactive mixture effects.17 It is not practically possible to test every single mixture that
may occur in the wider environment, and as some chemicals are not
being actively released, they may not be incorporated into risk assessments.
B[a]P along with PCBs and PBDEs are extremely abundant
contaminants and therefore are highly likely to occur together in
mixtures. They also have at least one common toxicity pathway, which
may allow for interactions to arise. The possibility that synergy
in mixtures, especially those including legacy contaminants, may go
undetected is concerning. Therefore, we need to have efficient techniques
to test for interactions in mixtures that can be used to guide risk
assessments.

Most of cell properties standard determinations
are made by staining
methodologies;18 confocal laser scanning
microscopes equipped with photobleaching protocols;19 flow cytometry;20 and classical
methods of fresh and dry cell density determinations.21−23 However, as a main disadvantage, most of these methodologies suffer
from being highly time-consuming.24 For
screening of genotoxicity and oestrogenicity of endocrine disrupting
chemicals, molecular biochemical methodologies are gold standard,25 including E-SCREEN assay,26 MVLN assay,25 and yeast estrogen
screen (YES) assay,27 among others.25,28−30 Endocrine disrupting chemicals have also been measured
by modern analytical instrumental techniques, for example, by using
gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS),31−33 liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS),34 and ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled
with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).33,35 In addition,
many other cell properties have been investigated by atomic force
microscopy,36 such as the influence of
air drying and fixation on the morphology and viscoelasticity of cells,37 probing of cell mechanics,38 and cell elasticity.39

Vibrational spectroscopy techniques have proved to be valuable
exploratory tools for various, diverse experimental purposes, including
cancer research,40,41 environmental monitoring,42,43 and quality assurance.43,44 These techniques offer
a number of advantages such as being cost-effective, nondestructive
to samples, and high throughput. Vibrational spectroscopy can be used
to create a biochemical profile of samples by measuring the absorption
of light and changes in vibrational energy levels.45 Two main vibrational spectroscopy techniques have been
used significantly in biochemical-related applications: Raman and
infrared (IR) spectroscopy.46−49 The first one, based on Raman scattering effect,
has found many applications, including hyperspectral imaging of single
cells,50 detection of biological molecules
and environmental contaminants,51 identification
of spatial and cellular changes,52 and
detection of PCB and PBDE compounds.53,54 Attenuated
total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy
is a specific type of vibrational spectroscopy where the sample of
choice is interrogated with polychromatic IR light, which is reflected
within an internal reflective element (IRE).55 Biochemical bonds absorb photons at specific characteristic wavelengths
depending on the frequency required for bonds to vibrate and have
a change in dipole moment. The output from this is a spectrum showing
the absorbance of infrared light at each of the measured wavelengths,
which characterizes the molecular composition of the sample and can
be used to infer structural and functional information.55 Previously, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy has been used
for environmental monitoring42 and to study
the effects of environmentally relevant chemicals in cells and tissues.56,57 This has led to consideration of the technique as a tool to analyze
the biological effects of chemical mixtures. Similarly, other types
of IR spectroscopy have been used as a powerful tool for many types
of cell investigations.58,59 In this study, we aim
to assess ATR-FTIR spectra in this capacity by using it to characterize
the cellular effects of exposure to single contaminants as well as
binary mixtures of B[a]P with PCB or PBDE congeners
in avian fibroblast cells. We also aim to determine whether IR spectroscopy
can be used to identify when a binary mixture of dissimilarly acting
agents leads to nonadditive mixture effects and whether the effects
of mixtures can be predicted by creating expected spectra from cells
treated with the individual component chemicals. In this manner, ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy may represent a complementary tool to quickly and cheaply
analyze the effects of binary pairs of environmental pollutants, either
as a screening tool before further analysis or to reduce the scale
of mixture experiments by using single exposure data.

Results and Discussion
Biochemical
Alterations Induced by Contaminants
To
verify if ATR-FTIR spectroscopy can be used as a tool to study mixtures,
it was first established whether the technique could identify biochemical
alterations associated with dose and treatment exposures. For visualization,
spectra were processed using PCA-LDA (10 PCs, 97% explained variance)
to produce one-dimensional (1D) scores plots that illustrate treatment-induced
separation from control along with corresponding loading plots to
show biochemical alterations responsible for the separation. Tentative
wavenumber alterations were assigned using spectral interpretations
from Movasaghi et al.60 Loading plots along
linear discriminant 1 (LD1) from B[a]P-treated mallard
fibroblasts (Figure 1A, see Supporting Information (SI) Table S1) showed that the top six wavenumber-associated alterations induced
by B[a]P were seen in molecular functional groups
found in lipids (C=O stretching in esters, 1709 cm–1), amide I (C=O stretching weakly coupled to C–N stretching
and N–H in-plane bending, 1647 and 1612 cm–1), amide II (C–N stretching and C–N–H bending
weakly coupled to C=O stretching, 1547 and 1504 cm–1), and glycogen (C–O stretching in −CH2OH,
1026 cm–1) regions. As B[a]P is
reported to be a genotoxin and potential carcinogen, some DNA alterations
(PO2– symmetric and asymmetric stretchings)
were expected. The loadings show that there are peaks in the DNA region
(ca. 970–1250 cm–1), indicating that alterations
are occurring there; however, other alterations outweigh those in
magnitude. This indicates that alterations associated with different
mechanisms of toxicity, or possibly those downstream of interactions
with DNA, are affecting cells to a greater extent. It has been shown
that in its parent form, B[a]P can also cause toxicity
via nongenotoxic pathways.61

the top six wavenumbers highlighted from mallard cells treated with
B[a]P, BDE47 and BDE209. Significance from control

test [P < 0.05 level (*) or P < 0.01 level (**)]. Mallard cells treated with (A) 10–6 and 10–10 M B[a]P; (B) 10–8 M, 10–10 M, and 10–12 M BDE47; and (C) 10–8 M, 10–10 M, and 10–12 M PBDE209.

The sensitivities and specificities of the PCA-LDA model
to differentiate
cells exposure to different concentration levels of B[a]P are depicted in Table 1. Cells treated with B[a]P 10–6 M (highest concentration) have a sensitivity of 80%, indicating
that this group is very distinct from the others. Hockley et al. reported
concentrations as low as 10–7 M B[a]P to alter MCF-7 and HepG2 cells.62 However,
for control cells and cells exposed to a small concentration of B[a]P (10–10 M), the sensitivity values
are low (60–69%), indicating similarities between these two
groups.

The toxicity
of B[a]P is known to be dependent
on a number of factors, including cell type, as the expression of
CYP isoforms is necessary to metabolize it to a pro-carcinogenic,
DNA-binding form.62 Fewer DNA alterations
than expected may be seen in mallard cells due to differential expression
of CYP1A1 or differences in the AhR receptor, which needs to be bound
to instigate downstream responses leading to the expression of CYP
enzymes.63 Although overall results were
not significant, Western blot analysis (see SI Table S7) does appear to show a reduction in CYP1A1 expression
in comparison to data available from MCF-7 cells (not presented here),
which may explain this. As well as genotoxic mechanisms, some metabolic
intermediates of B[a]P have redox cycling capabilities
that can cause oxidative stress.64 This
may explain alterations seen in lipids and proteins due to damage
by ROS as well as subsequent instigation of protein and carbohydrate
remodeling pathways.62,65

ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was
able to detect different alteration profiles
in cells exposed to PBDE congeners 47 and 209 (Figure 1B,C). The PCA-LDA model (10 PCs, 98% explained
variance) shows high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (96%) for control
cells, indicating that this group is distinguished from the others
(treated cells) (Table 1). Within the treated cells groups, the sensitivities values are
considerably low (28–44%), showing that the effect of concentration
variation did not influence cell alterations. The six largest alterations
in BDE47-treated mallard cells (Figure 1B, see SI Table S2) largely
reflected protein biomolecule alterations including C=O stretching
in amide I (1643 cm–1), amide II (1543 cm–1; 1497 cm–1), and methyl groups (asymmetric C–H
deformation, 1454 cm–1) as well as some fatty acid
lipid alterations (C=O stretching in carboxylic acid, 1767
and 1713 cm–1). Score and loading plots from mallard
cells treated with BDE209 (Figure 1C, see SI Table S3) also
highlight extensive protein alterations. Exposure is also associated
with amide I (1612 cm–1), amide II (1497 cm–1), and amide III (C–N stretching and N–H
in-plane bending with contributions of CH2 wagging vibrations,
1237 cm–1) changes as well as lipid (1717 cm–1) and DNA (symmetric PO2– stretching, 1088 and 976 cm–1) alterations. Although
the toxicities of PBDE congeners such as 47 and 209 have been comparatively
well studied in whole tissues or organisms,66 there is less information on the underlying toxic cellular effects.
It has been shown that both these congeners, particularly BDE47, have
neurological and developmental toxicity, which is thought to be caused
by contaminant-induced oxidative stress. Generation of ROS can occur
even at low contaminant concentrations and lead to sublethal effects
such as damage to protein secondary structure and lipids.67 BDE209 also induced DNA alterations in the mallard
cells (Figure 1C).
For this compound, the PCA-LDA model (10 PCs, 97% explained variance)
presented high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (92%) for cells treated
with 10–8 M BDE209 (Table 1), showing that this group is very different
from the others. Control cells did not differentiate well from cells
treated with 10–12 M and 10–10 M BDE209, where a sensitivity of 66% was found. BDE209 is a much
larger congener and has been associated with carcinogenic effects.
It has been found to cause DNA damage via oxidative stress-related
pathways, but it may also be able to induce epigenetic changes as
well.68,69

Similar to the toxicity of PBDEs,
PCBs can cause neurotoxicity,
endocrine disruption, and potentially carcinogenic changes depending
on the congener involved. The position of chlorine molecule substitutions
in each congener determines its ability to exert toxicity via AhR-mediated
pathways. Co-planar congeners such as PCB126 have a much stronger
affinity for the receptor than those that are planar such as PCB153.
One of each type of congener was investigated to determine whether
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy could elucidate a different mechanism of toxicity
between the two. Figure 2A (see SI Table S4) shows that in mallard
cells, PCB153 treatment was associated with alterations in lipids
(1709 cm–1), amide I (1624 cm–1), and amide II (1535; 1497 cm–1), as well as in
regions associated with collagen (CH3 asymmetric bending,
1458 cm–1; symmetric C–O stretching, 1030
cm–1) by using a PCA-LDA model with 10 PCs (98%
explained variance). The sensitivity values for this compound in Table 1 are considerably
low (20–60%), indicating not much difference between the control
cells and those treated with three different levels of PCB153. Although
solvent features might be present in collagen-related areas (nonane
absorptions at 1500–1400 cm–1 due to CH3 bending), alterations of the spectra were not seen in mallard
fibroblasts treated with PCB126. Previous study has shown that in
fibroblast cells, PCB153 can cause an increase in cellular levels
of type I collagen.70 This may represent
an AhR-independent pathway that PCB153 can mediate cellular effects
through and that is detectable using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. PCB126-treated
mallard cells (Figure 2B, see SI Table S5) showed alterations
in lipids (1744; 1705 cm–1), amide I (1647; 1609
cm–1), amide II (1504 cm–1), and
cytosine and guanine in DNA (C–N stretching, 1369 cm–1) through a PCA-LDA model using 10 PCs (95% explained variance).
In this model, sensitivities and specificities are relatively high
for control cells (sensitivity = 71%; specificity = 89%) and cells
treated with 10–8 M PCB126 (sensitivity = 72%; specificity
= 85%), indicating that these two groups are quite distinct from the
others. The low sensitivities for 10–10 M (56%)
and 10–12 M (48%) PCB126 indicate that these groups
are somewhere similar. Initially, the range of alterations induced
appears quite similar, but there are crucial differences between the
alterations induced by the two congeners (PCB153 and PCB126), such
as collagen alterations in PCB153-treated fibroblasts, which when
supported by evidence from other studies could reveal key toxicity
mechanisms. In cells treated with PCB126, alterations in the DNA region
of the spectra were more pronounced than in PCB153-treated cells.
This may be mediated by binding to the AhR and downstream gene transcription
processes as PCB126 is a co-planar congener and therefore a more potent
AhR agonist. PCB153 has a much weaker affinity for AhR binding and
is hypothesized to exert toxicity via a number of other receptors.71

Identification of Interactions
in Binary Mixtures
To
investigate the interactions in real “observed” mixtures
of B[a]P with BDEs and PCBs contaminants in terms
of IR spectra, a PCA-LDA model was built comparing different mixtures
(Figure 3). Figure 3A shows the PCA-LDA
scores for cells exposed to the five different types of compounds
(B[a]P, BDE209, BDE47, PCB126, and PCB153), where
some clustering patterns are observed. Sensitivity and specificity
values for this model are depicted in Table 2. For BDE209, BDE47, and PCB126, the sensitivities
are high (89, 98, and 77%, respectively), indicating that cells exposed
to these compounds form very separated clusters, while for B[a]P and PCB153, the sensitivities (42 and 68%, respectively)
indicate a mixing. Considering the binary mixtures (Figure 3B), only the mixture of B[a]P with BDE47 seems to affect the cells differently (sensitivity
= 72%) (Table 2). The
other mixtures have superposed clustering (sensitivity = 37–56%),
indicating common cell modifications.

levels. LD stands for linear discriminant function based on the canonical
variables scores of PCA-LDA.

Spectral data from cells treated with individual
chemical components
were added together (once background alterations were removed) to
produce an “expected” spectrum, which could be compared
to the “observed” spectrum derived from cells treated
with the actual binary mixture. The baseline-subtracted spectra from
each single exposure were used since in theory baseline absorptions
should be zero, although contribution of some cellular components
can be obscured. This was performed to remove physical variations
that can contribute to the baseline signal, especially sample thickness,
optical path, and pressure on the ATR module. Therefore, using the
baseline-subtracted spectra, the expected spectra should be ideally
identical to the observed spectra.

To identify areas of the
spectrum where the observed and expected
spectra diverged, the plots were color-coded so that green areas represent
where the observed spectrum is less than expected and red areas represent
where the observed spectral result is greater than expected. Theoretically,
when interactions occur in a mixture, the expected and observed spectrum
will be significantly different and these areas need to be investigated
as if the observed spectrum is greater than expected, enhanced toxicity
may occur.72 Spectral differences related
to shifting and appearance of new bands are associated to changes
in the chemical structure of the samples associated with the presence
or absence of the contaminants. As there were a number of predicted
models tested, color-coding the spectra in this manner facilitates
broad identification of interactions for consideration before more
detailed analysis. This allows the researcher to rapidly answer experimental
questions such as in which binary mixture is an interaction most likely
to be occurring, where enhanced chemical action is most likely to
be occurring, and which areas of the spectrum are most affected. Figures 4–7 show plots of expected and observed spectra for
mallard cells treated with binary mixtures of B[a]P with PBDEs or PCBs. The observed spectrum is derived from cells
treated with the actual binary mixture (denoted by a solid line) and
the expected spectra are based on an additive prediction using cells
treated with individual chemical components (denoted by a dashed line).

spectral models, showing preprocessed (first-order differentiation
baseline-corrected and vector-normalized) expected and observed spectra
from mallard cells treated with a binary mixture of B[a]P and BDE47. Expected spectra are denoted by the dashed line, and
observed spectra are denoted by the solid line. The green areas represent
where the observed spectrum is less than the expected spectrum, and
red areas represent where the observed spectral result is greater
than the expected spectrum. (A) B[a]P 10–6 M and BDE47 10–8 M; (B) B[a]P

B[a]P 10–10 M and BDE47 10–8 M; and (D) B[a]P 10–10 M and BDE47 10–12 M.

The majority of the plots showed more green- or red-coded
areas
than white areas, which indicates that there is a match between the
expected and observed spectra. This appears to suggest that interactions
could be occurring when cells are treated with most of the binary
mixtures; however, the extent of the difference between the expected
and observed spectra is likely to be an important factor. There are
irregularities in the red and green areas varying the contaminant
and concentration due to the nature of the contaminant used and the
effect of the concentration in possible chemical interactions, suggesting
gain in the expected toxicity in spectra containing more red regions
and reduction of the expected toxicity in spectra containing more
green regions. Still, spectral results can be more complex to interpret
as the range of alterations measured encompasses many toxicological
endpoints.73 For toxicological assessment,
cases where the observed is less than the expected are not as much
of a concern as the prediction has been conservative. Overall, the
spectra from cells treated with mixtures of B[a]P
and BDE47 (Figure 4) had the most green areas, potentially signifying that these compounds
may instigate less than additive alterations when in a mixture. There
were also some regions indicating less than additive alterations in
spectra from cells treated with B[a]P and BDE209
(Figure 5), mostly
when exposed to 10–10 M B[a]P and
10–8 M BDE209 (Figure 5C). However, some spectra were immediately
notable as they had large red-coded areas. When assessing toxicity,
these areas would warrant further investigation as they could represent
possible biomolecular endpoints, where greater than additive mixture
effects may be occurring. Failure to predict and capture enhanced
mixture toxicity could put the species under consideration at risk.
Mallard cells exposed to mixtures of B[a]P and BDE209
(Figure 5) had large
spectral areas, where greater than expected alterations were occurring.
In particular, the plot of cells treated with 10–6 M B[a]P and 10–8 M BDE209 (Figure 5A) was more than
90% red and the observed alterations were more than double those expected
in some areas. A similar effect was also seen in cells exposed to
10–6 M B[a]P and 10–8 M PCB153 (Figure 6A).

Depending on the binary mixture and concentration, the biomolecules
that were most affected varied, which can occur as IR methods measure
all biomolecules in a cell and thus all toxicological endpoints. This
makes the technique more suited to broad assessment of trends between
expected and observed spectra. For example, in the ca. 900–1100
cm–1 region, mixtures were most likely to generate
less than additive alterations or mixture effects where the expected
and observed spectra match well. Used in this manner, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy
can provide a simple and fast tool to identify general areas of divergence
between expected and observed spectra, making it an ideal screening
tool for mixture interactions. It may be used to identify mixture
effect trends and direct further in-depth analysis.

Predicting
Effects of Binary Mixture Using IR Spectroscopy
An essential
part of the study of mixtures is investigating if
the effects of a chemical combination can be accurately predicted
so that detrimental mixture toxicity can be circumvented. As the majority
of mixtures exhibit additive toxicity, regulatory assessments are
commonly based on this assumption, so in this study, a predictive
pseudospectrum was created based on the model of additivity. The expected
and observed spectra were compared to understand how accurate the
predictive model was as well as looking at how and why the two spectral
results might differ. The use of a predictive peudospectra created
from individual spectral data may be useful in reducing the scope
of mixture toxicity investigations as it may not be practical to actually
test all possible mixtures.

It was immediately visually evident
that the majority of observed spectral alterations induced by binary
mixtures of B[a]P and PBDE or PCB congeners did not
match those expected using component chemical data. This was also
confirmed by a goodness-of-fit analysis using a similarity coefficient
(Table 3). This coefficient
shows that majority of expected and observed spectra are lesser than
50% similar (γ < 0.5). The mixture less similar between expected
and observed spectra is for B[a]P 10–10 M plus PCB126 10–8 M (γ = 0.03). Comparing
the spectra for this mixture (Figure 7C), it is possible
to identify most green regions, indicating a decrease of toxicity
of the real spectrum in comparison to the theoretical one. Only three
mixtures had similarity above 50% (γ > 0.5), implying that
those
mixtures induce spectral alterations, which are closer to an additive
mixture model. The highest similarity between the expected and observed
spectra is for B[a]P 10–6 M plus
BDE209 10–8 M (γ = 0.84), in which the spectrum
for this mixture (Figure 5A) indicates a prevalence of red regions, thus a gain of toxicity.

In many spectral areas, the observed alterations were
greater than
expected, as seen in mallard cells treated with binary mixtures of
B[a]P and BDE209 (Figure 5), where observed absorbances were actually
much greater than the expected absorbances in many spectral regions.
Dissimilar to cells treated with BDE47 containing binary mixtures,
spectra from fibroblasts treated with binary mixtures of B[a]P and BDE47 (Figure 4) revealed that across most regions of the spectrum,
the observed absorbances were smaller than expected. BDE209 and BDE47
have been reported as having many common toxicities, but the main
difference between the two types of PBDE-containing mixtures is that
BDE209 is much larger and more brominated than the other congener.74 This physical difference could alter how the
molecule interacts with targets and other chemicals and may explain
differences in adherence to the additive model that can be seen between
the two mixture types. Observed spectra from avian cells treated with
binary mixtures, containing the highest concentration of either PBDE
congener with B[a]P (Figures 4A,C and 5A,C), both
showed consistent enhancement of a peak at 1750 cm–1 above that expected. This is the major region associated with C=O
vibrations of lipids and may denote greater-than-additive lipid damage,
which occurs when mallard cells are co-exposed to concentrations of
10–8 M PBDE congeners with B[a]P.

The observed spectral alterations in mallard fibroblasts treated
with B[a]P and PCB153 (Figure 6) were typically greater than those expected
over most regions of the spectrum. This could be seen at all concentrations
except B[a]P 10–10 M and PCB153
10–8 M (Figure 6C) when there were also quite a number of spectral
areas where the observed absorbances were smaller than expected. In
those combinations that showed largely greater-than-additive observed
alterations, the peaks in the ca. 1650–1750 cm–1 area were also notably enhanced. This was also observed in cells
treated with binary mixtures of B[a]P with PBDE congeners.
When treated with B[a]P and PCB126 (Figure 7), avian cells showed reduced
observed alterations compared to binary mixtures, which included PCB153.
In these mixtures, the differences between the observed and expected
spectra were also smaller than those seen in cells treated with PCB153,
possibly implying that the mixtures containing B[a]P and PCB126 exhibit a closer approximation of additive toxicity.
The general decrease in observed spectral alterations may be due to
the enhanced AhR-binding affinity of co-planar PCB126 in comparison
to the planar PCB153 congener.75 There
may be binding competition of receptors between B[a]P and PCB126, which led to a reduction in mixture toxicity. Further
exploration by Western blot analysis of CYP1A1, which is downstream
of the receptor (see SI Table S7), did
show less expression of CYP1A1 in mallard cells treated with binary
mixtures containing PCB126 compared to those containing PCB153, but
the result was not found to be significant. This may indicate that
the overall mixture toxicity is occurring via AhR-independent mechanisms
or that incorporation of all toxic endpoints across the spectrum may
mask specific toxicities, which need further testing for elucidation.

A number of chemical combinations were tested and the results have
varied across the spectrum with less-than-additive or more-than-additive
alterations being observed compared to the result expected using predictive
additive models. Only a very small proportion of the spectrum for
each combination showed a good fit between the observed and expected
results. This may be caused by interactions in the mixtures, indicating
that an additive model is not appropriate or may be due to the scale
of toxic endpoints incorporated into an IR spectrum. The AhR pathway,
and induction of downstream expression of phase I and II metabolism
enzymes, is known to be a common pathway involved in metabolism of
the contaminants studied, some of which are reported to have AhR-binding
affinities. Although less-than-expected results are not concerning
from a regulatory perspective as they represent less toxicity than
expected, these results also occurred in a large proportion of spectral
areas. Activation of the AhR pathway and metabolism of B[a]P is essential for its toxicity; it may be that the presence of
other PCB or PBDE contaminants shifts the pathway toward detoxification
so that more B[a]P is fully detoxified than converted
to the pro-carcinogen form. This has been observed in cells exposed
to mixtures of B[a]P as well as other PAHs.76,77 If IR spectroscopy was used as a predictive tool as described here,
the mixtures that display greater than expected alterations according
to an additive model would be those that represent the most risk to
environmental organisms. The combinations that lead to the most greater-than-expected
effects are seen in mallard cells treated with binary mixtures, including
B[a]P with BDE209 (Figure 5) or PCB153 (Figure 6), and deviations in the region around ca.
1650–1750 cm–1 are notable. As a greater-than-additive
effect in this area of the spectrum was induced by many of the combinations
tested, it may represent a common mechanism for environmental binary
mixtures of B[a]P with PBDEs or PCBs, which can lead
to enhancement of toxicity.

Evidence of potential greater than
expected alterations to some
biomolecules represents a cause for further investigation, particularly
as these effects were observed in mallard fibroblast cells, a species
commonly found in the environment. The results also suggest that the
effects of binary mixtures composed of B[a]P with
PCBs or PBDEs are contaminant and dose-dependent, where a combination
effect was observed involving a possible mechanism of B[a]P with PCBs or PBDEs, enhancing the toxicity in mixtures. Nevertheless,
as limitation, the use of fixed cells in this paper may obscure subtler
chemical shifts that can provide relevant biochemical information
due to cross-linkage. In addition, the mechanism and toxicity results
are dependent on cell type; for this reason, multiple cell types are
needed for a more robust study. However, this paper lends evidence
for the rationale that all possible mixtures need to be considered
during regulatory decisions as interactions between components or
at biological target sites can lead to deviations from the additive
model. Specific toxicology testing of mixtures on this scale would
be daunting, but we have shown that a panel of binary mixtures, composed
of various chemicals at different concentrations, can be studied in
a high-throughput manner using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Further testing
is needed to understand why so much of the observed spectral alterations
deviate away from the predictive additive model, but IR spectroscopy
is a unique approach that can study the effects of binary mixtures
at the biomolecular level. It may have application as a tool to screen
chemical mixture-induced alterations for nonconformance to additivity
and to direct further toxicology testing. This would be particularly
effective when paired with color-coding of the spectra to indicate
where deviation from the additive model and possible interaction occurs.
However, although IR spectroscopy can act as a complementary tool
to investigate the effect of contaminants in cells, it cannot be used
as a single instrumental technique. Other techniques should be employed
to help solve the complexity of the system under investigation, providing
additional information that can enrich the IR data.

Materials and
Methods
Test Agents
Stocks of PBDE congeners 47 and 209 were
purchased and dissolved in nonane at a concentration of 50 μg/mL,
from LGC Standards (Teddington, UK). PCBs 153 and 126 were purchased
as powders from Greyhound Chromatography and Allied Chemicals (Birkenhead,
UK) and made up in nonane (anhydrous ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset,
UK). B[a]P was purchased in powder form Sigma and
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK). Stock solutions of treatment chemicals were made up to
a concentration of 2 μM in DMSO and then serially diluted in
DMSO to the required experimental concentrations. Vehicle controls
consisted of the same amount of DMSO as used in chemical treatments,
spiked with equal quantities of nonane.

Cell Culture
Mallard
(Anas platyrhynchos) dermal fibroblasts
were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2% chicken serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% nonessential amino
acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Nottinghamshire, UK), and a penicillin
and streptomycin mixture (100 U/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively).
Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in air at a temperature of 37°C. Subculture was performed twice
weekly by disaggregation with trypsin (0.05%)/EDTA (0.02%) solution
before spinning at 1000×g for 5 min. The resultant cell pellet
was then resuspended in fresh complete DMEM and seeded into T75 flasks
for routine subculture or T25 for cell experiments and Western blotting
[method provided in SI]. Unless stated
otherwise, all cell culture consumables were purchased from Lonza
(Verviers, Belgium).

Cell Experiments
After seeding into
T25 flasks, cultures
were left for 24 h to allow cells to attach and enter into S-phase.
After 24 h, the cells were treated with either single agents of B[a]P, BDE47, BDE209, PCB126, or PCB153 or binary mixtures
of 10–6 or 10–10 M B[a]P with a PCB or PBDE congener at 10–8 or 10–12 M. Experiments for single substances and binary
mixtures were conducted in parallel. These concentrations were arbitrarily
selected aiming to simulate low concentrations in the cellular system
found in real environmental conditions.62,78−82 For single agent treatments, 25 μL of the appropriate treatment
was added to each flask as well as 25 μL of DMSO so the effects
could be compared to binary mixture exposures, which involved treating
with 25 μL each of two chemicals. Vehicle controls were treated
with 50 μL of DMSO (with nonane). Total DMSO concentrations
did not exceed 1% v/v. The cells were exposed to treatments for 24
h before they were disaggregated with trypsin, washed three times
with 70% ethanol to remove residual media, and then fixed for 24 h
in 70% ethanol. After fixation, the cells were pipetted onto IR-reflective
low-E glass slides (Kevley Technologies, Chesterland, OH) and allowed
to dry in air before being placed in a desiccator for 24 h to remove
any remaining water. This procedure was repeated at five different
points in time to give five technical replicates (n = 5, 5 spectra each) recorded in sequence, in a time frame of approximately
12.5 min (2.5 min per technical replicate). As a result, 25 spectra
were recorded for each concentration level.

ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy
Five spectra per slide were acquired
using a Bruker TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrometer with Helios ATR attachment,
which contained a diamond IRE with a sampling area of 250 μm
× 250 μm (Bruker Optics, Coventry, UK). The spectra were
acquired with an 8 cm–1 spectral resolution with
32 co-additions, giving rise to a 3.84 cm–1 spectral
data spacing. A mirror velocity of 2.2 kHz was used. Before each sample,
a background measurement was taken to account for atmospheric changes
and the diamond was cleaned with distilled water between samples.

Expected IR Spectra
Expected IR spectra for binary
mixtures were constructed based on an additive model following Beer-Lambert’s
law, in which the total observed absorbance in each wavenumber k (Ak,total) is the result of the sum of the absorbance for all chemical components
in this same wavenumber (Ak,1, Ak,2, ..., Ak,n)83 1  For a binary mixture of components A and B (j wavenumbers) 2   3   4   5  where s is the product of
the optical path length (b) by the molar absorptivity
coefficient (ε); c is the concentration for
individual components; a is the resulting binary mixture
spectrum; s is the spectrum for individual components;
and c is the relative concentration between the components.

Thus, the expected mixture spectra were built adding the IR spectra
from cell exposed to single contaminants, where the weight for each
spectrum is the relative contaminant concentration. The same experimental
concentrations in the real binary mixtures were used to generate the
expected binary mixture spectra.

Spectral Processing and
Computational Analysis
Computational
analysis was performed within MATLAB 2013a (The MathsWorks, MA) environment
using an in-house developed toolbox called IRootLab (http://trevisanj.github.io/irootlab/)
and the Classification Toolbox for MATLAB.84 Raw spectra were cut to the fingerprint region (900–1800
cm–1). Spectra were first-order differentiation
baseline-corrected, vector-normalized, and mean-centered. Principal
component analysis (PCA) was combined with linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) to allow exploratory analysis of treatment-induced spectral
alterations. PCA reduces the original spectral data set into a few
number of principal components (PCs) accounting for the majority of
the explained variance while reducing noise. Each PC is composed of
scores and loadings, representing the variance on sample and variable
(i.e., wavenumber) directions, respectively.85 PCA also solves problems of ill-conditioned data (data with large
condition number) by reducing redundant information across the spectra
and solving collinearity problems. The PCA scores are then used as
input variables for LDA.86 LDA is a supervised
classification technique that is used to obtain interclass separation
through a Mahalanobis distance calculation. The PCA-LDA classification
scores (cf(ti)) are calculated in a non-Bayesian form as follows86,87

PCA decomposition 6  LDA 7  where X represents the
spectral
data set; T is the PCA scores; P is the
PCA loadings; E is the PCA residuals; ti is the scores vector for a given sample i; t̅k is
the mean scores vector for class k; Cpooled is the pooled covariance matrix; and T denotes
the matrix transpose operation.

PCA-LDA is one of the most used
classification techniques for spectral
data due to its relative simplicity,86,88 being a powerful
technique for analyzing classes with similar variance structures and
data sets with small number of samples.86,87,89 Cross-validated PCA-LDA (leave-one-out cross-validation)
was performed. Significance was determined in GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad
Software Inc., CA) using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
post-hoc test. Significance testing was performed using sample means
rather than all spectral data. Goodness-of-fit between the model and
observed result was estimated by a similarity coefficient (γ)
calculated in a classical least-squares sense as follows 8  where x is the “observed”
spectra and ŝ is the “expected”
spectra.

As a result, γ is a real number indicating the
degree of
similarity between the observed and expected spectra. Its value ranges
from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (maximum similarity).
