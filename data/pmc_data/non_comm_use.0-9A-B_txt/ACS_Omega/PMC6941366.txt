Cuprous oxide and copper have been synthesized via the
solvothermal
process using basic copper carbonate as the source of copper. Pure
Cu2O or Cu could be afforded by simply varying the solvent
while keeping the temperature and time constant. In this study, copper-based
materials were coated on jute stick pieces (JSP) in situ. Cu2O-coated JSP (Cu2O-JSP) and Cu-coated JSP (Cu-JSP) were
characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP were found to be
active against Escherichia coli NCIM
2931 (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial nature of the material
and the buoyant nature of Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP were exploited
to develop beaded necklace-like strands that could be floated on potable
water to effectively prevent aerial contamination. Leaching of copper
from both Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP into water was found to be
below the permissible limit for copper in drinking water.

1 Introduction
Readily accessible water
is often contaminated due to environmental
pollution, thereby causing serious health issues when consumed as
such. Consumption of purified water is essential for healthy living;
however, owning a personal water purification unit is not usual for
many families in underdeveloped and developing countries. Community
water purification plants are the go-to points for fetching purified
water by many people. Storage of water is a common practice for eventual
uses. However, microbial growth in stored water is inevitable, especially
in an unhygienic environment.1 Thus, safe
storage of the fetched water until the time of actual consumption
should not be neglected. Global loss of 2.2 million human lives per
annum in connection with unsafe drinking water and hygiene-related
diseases is a disturbing statistic.2

The use of copper metal and its ions as disinfecting materials
has been well known since ancient time and practiced by many.3 Grass et al. reviewed some works related to the
contact killing and self-disinfection abilities of copper surfaces.4 Schmidt et al. reported that the use of copper
alloys on stethoscope surfaces can minimize the risk of bacteria transfer
from patient to patient.5 Storage of water
in a copper pot is reported to be beneficial, and a claim of Sudha
et al.6 suggests that diarrheagenic bacteria
are killed in this manner. Jia et al.7 demonstrated
antibacterial properties of cellulose films coated with copper. Dankovich
and Smith8 coated copper nanoparticles
on paper filter and used the coated filter as an efficient material
for water purification. Electrochemically synthesized copper oxide
was employed against waterborne bacteria, as described by Pandey et
al.9 Abou Neel et al.10 incorporated copper oxide into degradable phosphate-based
glass fibers and demonstrated its potential for healing of wounds.
In addition to the antibacterial properties, copper is also known
to be effective against various viruses and fungi.11−13 Copper is an
essential micronutrient, hence beneficial when present at low concentrations;
however, it has some toxicity when overconsumed.14,15 On the basis of this literature survey, we considered to develop
a copper-based material that could prevent aerial contamination and
facilitate safe storage of water.

In this work, we developed
easy methods to coat cuprous oxide or
copper on buoyant jute stick pieces (agricultural waste). The antibacterial
potential of copper and the floating nature of the selected variety
of wood were found to be an effective combination for safe storage
of purified water with respect to prevention of aerial contamination.
With the material developed being inexpensive and the leaching being
below the permissible level, we anticipate ample practical use of
this finding. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on prevention
of aerial contamination in water reported so far.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Selection of Support Material
We
reasoned to coat copper on support materials such as buoyant wood
pieces and float those on potable water to prevent aerial contamination.
Jute sticks were considered as appropriate eco-friendly support materials
due to the lightweight and porous nature of their wood. Jute sticks
are available in plenty amount as agricultural waste; hence, it has
an added economic advantage.

2.2 Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP
Synthesis
of Cu2O and Cu under solvothermal conditions by refluxing
a mixture of Cu(NO3)2 and NaOH at 1:2 ratio
in glycerol medium at 140 °C is known in the literature.16 We wanted to follow this method to prepare copper-JSP
by immersing JSP in the reaction medium during the synthesis. However,
the method proved unsuitable with respect to our requirement. The
JSP lost its hardness due to the delignification in the wood caused
by the presence of NaOH.17 Further, the
softened wood shrank when separated, washed, and air-dried. In this
way, the coating on JSP got washed out (Scheme S1 and Figures S1 and S3).

To avoid the decomposition of lignocelluloses, it was necessary to
avoid NaOH. The use of basic copper carbonate (CuCO3·Cu(OH)2) as the source of copper provided a satisfactory result.
Optimized reaction conditions for the synthesis of Cu2O-
and Cu-coated JSP are schematically represented (Scheme 1). The use of glycerol–water (1:1) as a solvent favored the synthesis of
Cu2O, whereas the use of glycerol as a solvent favored
Cu. The synthesized metal components were coated on the JSP. The hardness
of JSP was not lost, and the coating on JSP was also retained after
washing. It is assumed that the mild nature of copper carbonate made
the difference.

Scheme 1 Cu2O and Cu Coating of JSPs
The color of JSP is off-white, and upon coating,
it changed to
orange and reddish brown for Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP, respectively
(Figure 1). For the
characterization and comparative study of JSP, Cu2O-JSP,
and Cu-JSP, we have recorded powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data
(Figure 2). PXRD patterns
show characteristic 2θ peak positions for Miller planes corresponding
to Cu2O (for Cu2O-JSP) and Cu (for Cu-JSP),
consistent with the X-ray diffraction pattern of Cu2O (JCPDS
05-0667) and Cu (JCPDS 85-1326). The peaks at 2θ = 14°,
16°, and 22° were assigned to (1̅10), 110, and (200)
planes of cellulose crystalline form, which relatively match with
2θ peaks of other plant fibers.18,19 Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images revealed the surface feature of uncoated JSP,
Cu2O-JSP, and Cu-JSP (Figure 3), and it was found that the sizes of Cu2O and Cu particles that are coated on JSP are in the range
of 400 to 600 nm (microparticles). Synthesis of Cu2O and
Cu was also performed in the absence of JSP (Scheme S2), and the material so formed was characterized by PXRD (Figure S4) and SEM (Figure S5a,b). The particle sizes when coated on JSP or in the absence
of JSP are found to be comparable for Cu2O and somewhat
bigger for Cu. Copper content in Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP was
analyzed by the inductively coupled plasma–optical emission
spectrometry (ICP–OES) technique after performing
acid hydrolysis. One piece of Cu2O-JSP was suspended in
10 mL of 1 M H2SO4(aq) and stirred for 12 h
to leach out the copper content. The JSP was lifted and washed with
2 × 5 mL of distilled water to afford adsorbed copper, if any.
The washing was combined with the acidic solution containing leached-out
copper. The resulting solution was used to determine copper content
in Cu2O-JSP. The same procedure was carried out to analyze
the copper content in Cu-JSP. The copper content values per piece
of Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP were found to be 3.238 ± 0.457
and 3.802 ± 0.220 mg, respectively.

2.3 Antibacterial Activity of Cu2O-JSP
and Cu-JSP
After incubation of inoculated agar-nutrient plates,
stacked with sterile JSP and test samples (Cu2O-JSP and
Cu-JSP) at 37 °C for 24 h, zones of inhibition were observed
only around the test samples (Figure 4), and hence, antibacterial activity of Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP was claimed. This may be due to the fact that, when
test samples were stacked on the surface of the inoculated agar-nutrient
Petri plates, the bacterial cells around the test samples were killed
and there were no subsequent growth around them.

Figure 4 Antibacterial activity
of Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP.

Inactivation of the bacterial cells may be due
to interaction of
copper with the thiol groups of the respiratory enzyme associated
with the cell membrane and other membrane proteins, which leads to
loss of their physiological function.20 On the other hand, no such destruction of the physiological functions
of any membrane-bound proteins takes places around the blank samples
(JSP), and bacteria remain alive and multiply with time.

2.4 Water Disinfection by Cu2O-JSP
and Cu-JSP
To ensure contact of bacterial cells with Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP, all the four experimental flasks were kept
in a rotary incubator shaker (100 rpm) at 37 °C. Viable bacteria
in the test sample appeared zero or below the detectable limit after
4 h (Figure 5a). As
JSP holds no antimicrobial properties, it did not show water disinfection
activity as a result of which the number of viable bacteria in both
control and blank samples remained at initial levels (Figure 5b). In the test samples, water
was exposed to Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP, and with first-hour
exposure, approximately 0.5-log reduction in viable bacteria was observed.
In the next successive hours, approximately 1-log reduction of viable
bacteria continued, and the active bacterial content in the test samples
was completely destroyed or reached below the detectable limit after
4 h (Figure 5).

water disinfection test experiments. (a) Nutrient agar plate showing
microbial content in 0.1 mL of each water sample at a time interval

Although copper is an essential trace element for
human health,
ingesting an amount with a concentration higher than 3 ppm leads to
nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Consistent consumption of copper
at a high concentration for a week or more also leads to gastrointestinal
irritation.21 Thus, after test experiments,
leaching of copper content from Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP into
water was tested. Copper leaching concentrations from Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP were found to be 0.87 ± 0.16 and 0.30 ±
10 ppm, respectively (Table 1). The leaching was found well below the permissible levels
(1.3 ppm), as prescribed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).22

2.5 Prevention of Aerial Contamination in Water
by Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP
Four beakers filled with
water and containing respective buoyant materials (Figure 6a) was kept for 5 days in open
air. After day 1, the microbial contamination values in control and
blank water samples were found to be 80 ± 10 and 60 ± 20
CFU/mL, respectively. These results clearly showed that the viable
microbial count in the blank sample was lesser as compared to the
control sample. This difference may be due to adsorption of microbes
on the surface of the JSP. Microbial count in the test water sample
was found to be zero or below the detectable limit, which indicated
that microbes were destroyed at the air–water interface after
interacting with Cu2O-JSP or Cu-JSP. Microbial content
in control and blank samples increased exponentially per day upon
days of aerial exposure. From day 2 onward, the microbial content in blank samples was found
to be always higher than the contamination in the control samples.
At the end of day 5, average microbial content in control samples
was found to be 3.8 × 106 CFU/mL, and in blank samples,
it was found to be 1 × 107 CFU/mL. This difference
in contamination was possibly due to the substrate nature of JSP.23,24 It was possible that the adsorbed microbes on JSP started feeding
on the lignocellulosic matter and multiplied, leading to more contamination.
In the test water samples, it was only 600 ± 100 CFU/mL, which
was significantly very low compared to those of control and blank
samples (Figure 6b).

interface. (a) Nutrient agar plate showing microbial content in 0.1
mL of each water sample at a time interval of 24 h. (b) Variation
in CFU/mL in control, blank, and test samples with increasing number
of days of aerial exposure.

At the air–water interface, the materials
acted as a barrier
against microbes and prevented water samples from aerial microbial
contamination. Copper leaching from Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP
was found to be below the action limit (Figure 7), as prescribed by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).22 After day 1,
leaching concentrations of copper from Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP
were 0.39 ± 10 and 0.19 ± 07 ppm, respectively. With an
increase in number of days of contact of test materials with water,
an increase in leaching was observed, but it remained below permissible
limits at the end of day 5.

Cu-JSP in water with
increasing number of days during prevention of water from aerial microbial
contamination.

2.6 Proposed Overview for the Mechanism of Action
Accumulations and activities of microbes of at the air–water
interface are well documented.25,26 When water gets contaminated
by microbes from air, the contaminants float on the water surface
due to low weight and Brownian motion. We propose that the contact
of aerial microbes with water is facilitated by the Brownian motion
of the microbes. Thus, the microbes interact with materials at the
air–water interface. When the microbes interact with the test
sample, Cu2O-JSP or Cu-JSP, copper shows its action and
deactivation of microbes takes place (Scheme 2). The interaction of membrane proteins of
microbes with the Cu2O or Cu coating of our materials might
trigger the release of Cu+ as well as Cu2+ ions
at the microbes.27 The affinity of thiol
(i.e., present in microbes) toward Cu+ and the ability
of Cu2+ to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) are well-known
phenomena that promote biocidal properties of these ions.28,29 Thus, the samples employed in our work are proposed to cause denaturation
of membrane proteins of microbes, leading to cell death. A similar
mechanism was proposed earlier by Swarnkar et al. to explain the biocidal
effect of Cu nanowires.30 The actual mechanism
of copper actions on microorganisms is a complex subject and beyond
the scope of this paper. A few out of many proposed mechanisms are
described below.

the Air–Water Interface

the

(e) Microbe inactivation due to its contact with Cu2O-JSP
or Cu-JSP. (f) Dead microbial cell getting detached from the surface
of Cu2O-JSP or Cu-JSP due to Brownian motion.

First and foremost, interaction between copper and microbes
is
necessary. Copper interacts with thiol groups of respiratory enzymes
associated with the cell membrane and inhibits their functions.20 It also interacts with other vital enzymes involved
in glycolysis and Krebs cycles, causing inhibition of these important
physiological processes.31 Meghana et al.
reported the Cu(I)-induced inactivation of fumarase A enzyme.28 These associations of enzymes and proteins with
copper disrupt their structure and functions and cause cell death
or viral inactivation. Copper-based compounds are also known to generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS), creating oxidative stress that kills
bacterial cells and also inactivates viruses.28,29,32,33 Antimicrobial
actions of copper also include degradation of nucleic acids.34−39

Since there is no study on prevention of aerial contamination
in
water by any method, a comparison could not be made. The results also
suggest that such buoyant biocide can have a very huge potential to
be applied in rural communities for cost-effective prevention of communicable
microbial diseases.

3 Conclusions
Selective syntheses of
Cu2O and Cu via the solvothermal
process were achieved by using basic copper carbonate where the selectivity
was controlled by simple variation of the solvent of choice. The syntheses
were performed in the presence of buoyant agricultural waste (jute
stick pieces, JSP), which allowed in situ coating of the copper-based
material on the JSP. These hybrid wood materials (Cu2O-coated
JSP and Cu-coated JSP) exhibited remarkable antibacterial properties.
The buoyant nature of the coated JSP was explored for the prevention
of aerial contamination in potable water as a proof of a new concept.
Beaded necklace-like strands of the coated JSP were floated on the
surface of water stored in a container. This finding is likely to
find application if storage of potable water until actual consumption
is a requirement.

4 Materials and Methods
Common chemicals
such as CuCO3·Cu(OH)2, glycerol, and sulfuric
acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific,
India. Nutrient broth, agar, and disposable Petri plates were acquired
from HiMedia, India. Jute sticks (agricultural waste) were collected
from agriculture fields (West Bengal, India). Jute sticks were transversally
cut into cylindrical shell-shaped pieces (height = 1.0 ± 0.1
cm, diameter = 1 ± 0.1 cm, weight ≈ 0.2 g, and density
≈ 0.25 g/cm3), washed with distilled water, then
separated, and air-dried at room temperature. Purified water was sterilized
prior to contamination studies. Cuprous oxide and copper were synthesized
from CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 and coated on jute stick
pieces (JSP) in situ. Standard methods were followed to study antibacterial
activity. The water disinfection property and prevention of contamination
of water were studied using the coated JSP.

4.1 Optimized Method for the Coating of Cu2O on JSP
A round-bottom flask was charged with jute
stick pieces (5 g), CuCO3·Cu(OH)2 (0.5527
g, 2.5 mmol), and 100 mL of glycerol–water (1:1). The mixture
was then heated under reflux at 130 °C with continuous stirring
for 24 h. The sample was cooled down to room temperature, and the
Cu2O-coated jute stick pieces were separated from the solvent.
The materials so obtained were immersed in 100 mL of distilled water
in a conical flask. The flask was allowed to stand for 12 h; however,
it was shaken gently at an interval of 1 h to remove absorbed/adsorbed
glycerol. The washing procedure was repeated at least twice to remove
all absorbed/adsorbed glycerol. The Cu2O-coated JSP so
obtained (Cu2O-JSP) was air-dried at room temperature.
The surface color of the JSP turned from off-white to light orange.

4.2 Optimized Method for the Coating of Cu on
JSP
The coating of Cu was carried out in a similar manner
as described above, except that the reflux was carried out in 100
mL of glycerol at 130 °C to afford Cu-coated JSP (Cu-JSP). The
surface color of the JSP turned from off-white to reddish brown.

4.3 Preparation of Liquid Nutrient Medium
Nutrient broth (1.3 g) was taken in a 200 mL beaker, and 100 mL of
reverse osmosis (RO) water was added to it. The mixture was stirred for a few minutes
to dissolve the medium completely. Twenty clean and dry test tubes
of 20 mL volume each were taken, 5 mL of the dissolved medium was
transferred to each test tube, and the mouths of the test tubes were
closed with cotton plugs. The test tubes were sterilized by autoclaving
them at 121 °C for 15 min, followed by cooling them to room temperature
and then storing them for further use.

4.4 Preparation of Nutrient Agar Medium
Nutrient broth (6.5 g) was taken in a 1 L conical flask, and 500
mL of RO water was added to it. The mixture was stirred for a few
minutes to dissolve the medium. To this liquid nutrient medium, 7.5
g of agar powder was added, and the mouth of the flask was closed
with a cotton plug. It was then sterilized by autoclaving it at 121
°C for 15 min. It was then cooled to 60–70 °C, and
then approximately 15–20 mL of media was poured into sterile
disposable 90 mm Petri dishes. Once the media were solidified, the
plates were sealed with a parafilm and stored upside down in a refrigerator
(5 °C) for further use.

4.5 Antibacterial Tests of Cu2O-JSP
and Cu-JSP
Escherichia coli NCIM 2931 and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as test bacterial species. Colonies of E. coli NCIM 2931 and S. aureus were picked up from the nutrient agar plate with a sterile inoculating
loop and inoculated separately in 5 mL of sterile liquid nutrient
medium. These inoculated liquid nutrient media were incubated in a
rotary incubator shaker at 180 rpm and 37 °C overnight. One hundred
microliters of freshly cultured bacterial suspension (at mid-log phase)
was poured on the surface of the nutrient agar plate and spread uniformly
using a sterilized glass rod (L-rod). Sterile JSP as a blank sample
and Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP as test samples were stacked on
the agar surface by gentle pressing and incubated at 37 °C for
24 h. Zones of inhibition were observed only around the test samples
(Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP). The experiment was done in triplicate,
and consistencies in results were obtained.

4.6 Water Disinfection Experiments Using Cu2O-JSP and Cu–JSP
Four 1 L conical flasks (I–IV)
were taken, 500 mL of RO water was added to each flask, and their
mouths were closed with cotton plugs. All the four flasks containing
water were sterilized by autoclaving them at 121 °C for 15 min
and cooled them to room temperature. Uncoated jute stick pieces were
packed in an autoclave bag and also sterilized by autoclaving them
at the same temperature for the same time. Each conical flask containing
500 mL of sterile water was contaminated with 100 μL of freshly
cultured E. coli NCIM 2931 (∼105 CFU/mL). Flask-I was used for the control experiment, and
flask-II was used for the blank experiment in which one sterile JSP
was added. The remaining two flasks were used for test experiments.
One piece of Cu2O-JSP was added in flask-III, and one piece
of Cu-JSP was added in flask-IV. All the flasks were kept in a rotary
incubator shaker (100 rpm) at 37 °C. At a time interval of 1
h, 0.1 mL of contaminated water sample from each flask was inoculated
over a nutrient agar plate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After
4 h, in test samples, the active bacterial content reaches below the
detectable limit or zero. Variations in CFU/mL were analyzed via the
serial dilution method. A total of 0.1 mL of each water sample was
taken in plastic hinge-top vials, and 10-fold serial dilutions were
performed. A total of 0.1 mL of each diluted water sample was poured
on nutrient agar, spread uniformly across its surface using a sterile
glass rod (L-Rod), and allowed to dry. These Petri plates were incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h, and CFU/mL were counted. Experiments were
conducted in triplicates. Copper leaching into water from test samples
(Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP) was analyzed by ICP–OES following
disinfection experiments.

4.7 Prevention of Aerial Contamination of Water
by Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP
Three units of beaded necklace-like
strands were prepared by tethering jute stick pieces using nylon thread.
For the making of each necklace strand, 20 jute stick pieces, that
is, (i) JSP, (ii) Cu2O-JSP, or (iii) Cu-JSP, were employed.
Four 5 L beakers were taken, and each was filled with sterile water,
close to the brim. The sample in beaker-I was used for the control
experiment. The sample present in beaker-II was used for the blank
experiment, and a strand of sterile JSPs was allowed to float on the
surface of water. The samples in the remaining two beakers were used
for test experiments. Strands of Cu2O-JSP and Cu-JSP were
kept on the water surface of beaker-III and beaker-IV, respectively.
A set of these four beakers was kept in open air in building premises
for 5 days. At a time interval of 24 h, 0.1 mL of water samples was
poured on nutrient agar and spread uniformly across its surface using
a sterile glass rod (L-Rod) and allowed to dry. Three nutrient agar
plates were used for each water sample. The inoculated plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, and depending on microbial contamination
in water, the intensity of microbial growth was observed. Variations
in CFU/mL were analyzed via the serial dilution method, as described
in the previous section. After each day, 10 mL of the test water sample
was taken in a glass vial, and copper contamination was analyzed by
ICP–OES.

4.8 Characterization
Powder XRD patterns
of JSP, Cu2O-JSP, and Cu-JSP were obtained by using a Bruker
D8 Advance instrument. The surface feature of the sample was recorded
using a Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope and a Quanta 400
FEG scanning electron microscope. To analyze the quantity of copper
coated on JSP, acidic digestion of the test material was performed
followed by analyses of dissolved copper in the solution by ICP–OES.
The copper content is reported for three replicates with a standard
error.
