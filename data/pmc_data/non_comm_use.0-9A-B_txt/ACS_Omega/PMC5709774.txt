Cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs) can be potentially used in targeted
delivery of therapeutic cargoes. However, their conformation in solution
is poorly understood. We employed molecular dynamics simulations to
probe the structural fluctuations of an anionic CPP, pH Low Insertion
Peptide (pHLIP), in solution to determine the effects of modifications
to selected residues on the structure of pHLIP. Two types of modifications
were tested: (1) protonation of aspartic acid residues and (2) point
mutations known to affect the acid sensitivity of pHLIP. pHLIP samples
conformations ranging from coil to helix to sheet, and modifications
to pHLIP lead to subtle shifts in the balance between these conformations.
In some instances, pHLIP is as likely to form a helical conformation
as it is to form an unstructured coil. Understanding the behavior
of pHLIP in solution is necessary for determining optimal conditions
for administration of pHLIP and design of promising pHLIP variants.

Introduction
Cell-penetrating peptides
(CPPs) are a class of molecules with
potential applications ranging from antimicrobial agents to vehicles
for drug delivery.1 The pH Low Insertion
Peptide (pHLIP) is a fairly unique CPP, in that it is highly anionic
(overall charge of −5), long (AEQNPIYWARYADWLFTPLLLLDLALLVDADEGT),
and sensitive to changes in pH.2,3 In solution, pHLIP is
in a coiled conformation (state I); when exposed to the cell membrane
under alkaline conditions, pHLIP binds to the membrane surface, remaining
in a coiled conformation (state II); upon acidification of the environment,
the acidic residues in pHLIP are protonated, leading to folding into
an α-helix and insertion into the membrane (state III).4 Although circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence
spectroscopy are commonly used to monitor the transition of pHLIP
from state I → state II → state III, they cannot provide
atomistic insights into the interactions that characterize each state.
In particular, the behavior of pHLIP in solution (i.e., state I) is
poorly understood. This lack of understanding is an issue, as most
experiments with pHLIP require low peptide concentrations (<20
μM) to avoid aggregation.5 In addition,
point mutations of pHLIP have been utilized in attempts to improve
the acid sensitivity of the peptide,6−8 to varying degrees of
success. Often these mutations lead to loss of acid sensitivity or
increased aggregation effects. One recent study, in particular,9 in which non-natural amino acids were substituted
at positions 14 and 25 in pHLIP, led to enhanced insertion properties.

In light of these recent developments, we set out to utilize long-time-scale
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of pHLIP in state I to provide
a molecular-level characterization of the behavior of pHLIP in solution.
By using implicit solvent in our simulations, it is possible to routinely
access microsecond time scales to significantly enhance our ability
to completely sample the conformational landscape of pHLIP in state
I. We used a recently developed fast pairwise Generalized Born (GB)
implicit solvent model that has been successfully applied to protein
folding on the microsecond time scale.10,11

The
first set of variables tested was the protonation state of
aspartate residues in pHLIP. Earlier work on pHLIP had established
that pHLIP undergoes approximately two protonation events during folding
and insertion.2,12 In addition, point mutations
of D14 and D25, the two interior aspartate residues, led to complete
loss of acid sensitivity.13 The combination
of these results led to a conventional belief that D14 and D25 were
the “protonation switches” controlling pHLIP folding
and insertion.14 However, more recent solid-state
NMR studies have revealed that the C-terminal residues (D31 and D33)
are titrated first under acidic conditions and thus may play a direct
role in the function of pHLIP.15 We thus
examined singly protonated residues (D14, D25, D31, and D33) as well
as two combinations of titrated residues (D14/D25
and “All”, D14, D25, D31, and D33).

Results and Discussion
Site-Specific
Interactions Prevalent in State I
By
measuring the average distances between residues, we can identify
specific interactions that occur in pHLIP in state I (Figure 1). When pHLIP is completely
deprotonated (wild-type or WT), a small portion of the N-terminus
(residues 6–11) preferentially interacts with the majority
of the C-terminal half of the peptide (Figure 1A). Each individually protonated residue
has localized effects, decreasing
the interactions between the N-terminal segment and the C-terminal
half of the peptide. However, combinations of protonations are somewhat
different. When titrating both interior aspartic acid residues, there
is a marked increase in interactions (Figure 1A, D14/D25); when protonating all aspartic
acid residues, the interaction between the N-terminus and the C-terminal
half of pHLIP is almost completely abolished (Figure 1A, All).

Figure 1 Modifications to pHLIP lead to site-specific
interactions in state
I. (A) Residue–residue interactions of Cα atoms
in pHLIP. Regardless of the protonation state, increased interactions
exist between the C-terminal region (approximately residues 26–33)
and the N-terminal region (approximately residues 6–11) of
pHLIP. Titration of acidic residues has differing results on these
interactions. WT: fully deprotonated pHLIP; D14, D25, D14/D25, D31,
D33: protonated residues in pHLIP; and All: all aspartic residues
protonated. (B) Residue–residue interactions of Cα atoms in pHLIP for the helix-forming mutant (P20G) and non-natural
amino acids that improve pHLIP function.9 P20G mutation leads to a sharp increase of the N-terminus interacting
with most of the peptide. The non-natural amino acids individually
lead to greater interactions, but when both are incorporated, these
interactions are mainly lost. Aad: α-aminoadipic acid; Gla:
γ-carboxyglutamic acid.

The first point mutation (P20G) removes a conformational
restriction
from the peptide backbone (proline introduces a helical kink in the
folded conformation of pHLIP) and should allow residues proximal to
position 20 to interact with each other. This is the case, as the
N-terminus forms a continual interaction (i.e., <10 Å) with
almost all of the C-terminal residues (Figure 1B). We hypothesized that substitution of
non-natural amino acids into pHLIP would lead to increased interactions
within the peptide because of the increased negative charge (γ-carboxyglutamic
acid (Gla)) or extended side chain (α-aminoadipic acid (Aad))
of each residue. This is only partially the case; substituting Gla
at position 14 abolishes interactions with proximal residues while
simultaneously increasing interactions with the C-terminal end of
pHLIP (residues 24–30). A slight increase in interactions occurs
proximal to the Aad substitution at position 25; however, when combining
substitutions D14Gla and D25Aad, the only area of increased interactions
is with residues between the two substitutions.

Perturbing
the C-Terminal Half of pHLIP Leads to Noticeable
Increases in Helicity
We next examined the effect that these
variations had on the ability of pHLIP to form a helix in solution.
Although pHLIP does not form a helix in state I, even at acidic pH,
slight variations in the composition of pHLIP are able to form helices
at alkaline pH.13,16 Examination of the different
protonation states shows that in almost every case protonation of
a single acidic residue in pHLIP (D14, D25, D31, and D33) leads to
an increase in helical conformations that are sampled in state I.
This effect is not localized; most often, an increase in helicity
occurs in the hydrophobic stretch of leucines between P20 and D25
(Figure 2A).

Figure 2 Increased interactions
do not correlate with the helicity of pHLIP
in state I. (A) Probability of pHLIP to form a helical segment (as
defined by helical φ–Ψ angles for a three-residue
sequence) as a function of residue titration. Single protonations
in pHLIP increase helicity in state I. It is only when all aspartic
acids are protonated that a significant increase in helicity occurs
through a majority of the peptide. (B) Probability of pHLIP to form
a helical segment as a function of point mutations. P20G leads to
localized increase in helicity, due to the removal of proline kink.
Non-natural amino acids enhance helicity only at position 25 (D25Aad,
D14Gla/D25Aad). Thick black line: helix-forming propensity for the
fully deprotonated, wild-type pHLIP.

In addition, multiple protonations are not necessarily cooperative
because the protonation of both D14 and D25 leads to a decrease in
helicity compared to
that of the completely deprotonated pHLIP. (The highest residue–residue
interactions also occurred with D14 and D25 both protonated. It appears
that there is no direct relationship between interactions and helix-forming
propensity.) It is only when all aspartic acids are protonated that
a significant increase in helicity occurs through a majority of the
peptide.

Point mutations in pHLIP do not have as significant
an effect on
the increase in helicity as that of titrations of acidic residues
(Figure 2B). P20G leads
to an increase in helicity
in the interior of the peptide, consistent with observations from
CD spectra.7 D25Aad has the most noticeable
increase in helicity near the hydrophobic stretch, possibly due to
the charged side chain moving farther away from the peptide backbone.
However, combining both point mutations (D14Gla and D25Aad) leads
to a much smaller increase in helicity compared to that of the wild-type
pHLIP.

pHLIP Transiently Samples Both Major Secondary Conformations
in State I
It is only when we consider the entire secondary
structure conformational landscape that the true behavior of pHLIP
in state I emerges. When none of the acidic residues in pHLIP are
titrated (WT), the peptide samples α-helical and β-sheet
conformations almost equally (Figures 3 and S2). Titration of the
interior acidic residue, D14, leads to an increase in sampling of
β-strand-like backbone conformations while maintaining the same
level of sampling of helical conformations (Figure 3A). This trend is most striking when both
D14 and D25 are protonated (D14/D25); in this titration state, pHLIP
is twice as likely to sample a β-strand than an α-helix
(Figures 3A and S2). The other singly
protonated states, corresponding to the C-terminal aspartate residues
(D25, D31, and D33), lead to an increase in sampling of an α
helix compared to that of a β sheet (Figure 3). Finally, when all aspartic residues are
titrated (All), pHLIP is twice as likely to sample an α-helix
than a β-sheet (Figure 3).

Figure 3 pHLIP samples multiple secondary structures in solution. (A) Distributions
of the Ψ backbone dihedral angle for different protonation states
of pHLIP. The fully deprotonated state (WT, black line) samples the
helical region of phase space (−50–0°) more often
than the β-sheet region of phase space (120–170°).
D31: blue line; D33: blue dash; D14: black dash; D25: red line; D14/D25:
red dash; All: green line. (B) Distributions of the Ψ backbone
dihedral angle for mutants of pHLIP. All mutants favor helical over
sheetlike conformations. Point mutations at position 25 (D25Aad: blue
line; D14Gla/D25Aad: green line) increase the likelihood of pHLIP
to sample helical instead of sheetlike conformations. WT: black line;
P20G: black dash; D14Gla: red line. (C) Ratio of α-helical to
β-strand sampling, as determined by the areas under the respective
curves in (A) and (B).

Variable effects on secondary structure formation are observed
with respect to point mutations in pHLIP. Even though P20G has a localized
increase in helicity, the overall helicity is lower than that of WT
pHLIP (Figures 3B and S2). Combined with an increased sampling of β-strand
conformations, P20G is more likely to sample strands than helices.
Increased sampling of β-strands also occurs with the D14Gla
mutant. However, both cases where the non-natural amino acid was introduced
at position 25 lead to an increase in helicity and the propensity
to sample helical space versus sheet conformations (Figures 3 and S2).

Regardless of the variables tested, pHLIP is capable of
sampling
conformational space corresponding to β-strands, in over a third
of the cases more often than α-helices. There is precedent for
these phenomena experimentally: although it was originally suggested
that pHLIP adopts a random coil in state I,2 the corresponding CD spectrum has a negative mean residue ellipticity
from 210 to 230 nm. This would indicate that a mixture of secondary
structures (helices and sheets) exists17 and is in agreement with the theory that single-spanning transmembrane
helices are in a coil–helix equilibrium in solution.18 Sheets and helices are often key secondary structural
components in protein aggregation associated with neurodegenerative
diseases,19,20 and a recent study showed that amyloid fibrils
can form from α-helical transmembrane proteins.21 The fact that pHLIP aggregates at >10 μM into
a tetrameric
unit with exciton CD spectra representative of β-sheet formation4 is similar in nature to the aggregation of peptides
associated with amyloid formation.

Low-Energy States in Solution
Are Favored by C-Terminal Modifications
to pHLIP
Finally, we characterized the energy landscape of
pHLIP as a function of the radius of gyration and intramolecular interactions
(i.e., contacts). Generally speaking, the most energetically favorable
states of pHLIP are when it is the most compact. Nearly all of the
variants tested sample their lowest-energy conformations when the
radius of gyration is 12 Å or less (Table S1). The one noticeable exception is when D14 and D25 are protonated
(Figure 4A). It appears
that neutralizing the two interior aspartic acid residues leads to
less favorable intramolecular interactions, as this configuration
also has the lowest number of contacts. To compensate for this decrease
in interactions, pHLIP will rearrange into a β-sheet conformation.
In contrast, when all of the aspartic acids are protonated, pHLIP
predominantly lies in a very narrow distribution of the radii of gyration
(<10 Å). A common fold for the lowest-energy population had
a kinked α-helix from residues 21 to 31 as well as a helix from
residues 8 to 13.

Figure 4 Number of contacts is loosely correlated with the radius
of gyration
in pHLIP. (A) Singly protonated residues in pHLIP (D14, D31, and D33)
in general do not have a significant effect on the compactness of
pHLIP. The lone exception is when D25 is protonated (D25), which leads
to a decrease in the radius of gyration. Protonation of both interior
aspartates leads to a significantly less compact conformation (D14/D25).
When all aspartates are protonated, pHLIP is the most compact (All).
Far left: representative snapshots of WT, D14/D25, and All protonation
states of pHLIP. Sticks: deprotonated aspartic acid residues; spheres:
protonated aspartic acids. Note the presence of helices for WT and
All as well as the formation of β-sheet when D14 and D25 are
protonated. (B) Point mutations have little effect on the compactness
of pHLIP. The P20G mutation leads to a less compact conformation than
that of the wild-type pHLIP (WT). Notably, the double mutant (D14Gla/D25Aad)
samples a broader distribution of radii of gyration with an almost
equal probability of number of contacts.

Each of the point mutations studied has a slightly different
effect
on the conformation of pHLIP. D25Aad is the only mutation that results
in a slightly
smaller radius of gyration than that of WT pHLIP (Figure 4B). Although P20G introduces
greater helicity at position 20, this local ordering is offset by
poor folding in the rest of the peptide, manifesting in a much broader
distribution of contacts and radii of gyration. Incorporation of the
bulkier and more negatively charged Gla side chain at position 14
led to a broader distribution of the radii of gyration. Examination
of the simulated structures shows that the D14Gla variant has two
predominant populations: (1) the Gla side chain is within the vicinity
of the positively charged R11 side chain, and (2) the Gla side chain
is >15 Å from R11 (Supporting Information). The D25Aad variant, which has a longer side chain, has no interactions
with the R11 side chain. However, when incorporating both non-natural
amino acids (D14Gla and D25Aad), the D25Aad side chain forms a salt
bridge with the side chain of R11 for nearly half of the simulation.
This drastic shift to favor salt bridge formation does not necessarily
result in more compact conformations of pHLIP (Figure 4B); rather, the energetic gain from the salt
bridge likely offsets the less energetic conformations with fewer
contacts and larger radii of gyration.

The behavior of pHLIP
with respect to compactness is also consistent
with that of intrinsically disordered proteins. The two-dimensional
free energy landscape of pHLIP can be related to recent work studying
the effect of topology on the propensity of polyampholytes to aggregate
in solution.22−24 The Pappu and Ghosh groups developed a framework
whereby the primary peptide sequence could be used in combination
with the fraction of charged residues to relate to the compactness
of a monomer in terms of the radius of gyration.22,23 More recently, Lin and Chan were able to experimentally show that
the radius of gyration for a single peptide chain is correlated to
the phase behavior of multiple peptide chains.24 Although pHLIP is an anionic peptide with a highly asymmetric
charge distribution, the protonation states that we have tested follow
the same relationship between the radius of gyration and sequence
charge decoration (i.e., the radius decreases with increasing protonation
up to a fully deprotonated pHLIP) that was observed both theoretically
and experimentally (Supporting Information).

Conclusions
We have used MD simulations of pHLIP in
implicit solvent to characterize
the behavior of pHLIP in state I. pHLIP can sample multiple conformations
in solution, as observed from previous CD studies. Significantly,
we determined that
pHLIP is capable of folding into both helices and strands when acidic
residues are titrated. These conformational effects appear to be cooperative,
as the most noticeable folding occurs when either the interior or
all aspartic acid residues become protonated. This phenomenon is relevant
to our continued improved understanding of pHLIP function, as it is
necessary for determining optimal conditions for soluble administration
of pHLIP as a diagnostic imaging or drug-delivery agent as well as
its response to fluctuations in environmental pH while in solution.

Methods
System
Setup
pHLIP was taken from helix C of bacteriorhodopsin
(residues 73–107 of protein data bank (PDB) 2NTU), and GLY73 was
mutated to ALA. This results in pHLIP 2–36, as in Karabadzhak
et al. (referred to as pHLIP-4).16 The
peptide was then solvated and ionized using visual molecular dynamics
(VMD),25 with the CHARMM36 protein force
field26 used for heating simulations. The
peptide was gradually heated to 700 K over 20 ps, followed by 980
ps of production to denature it from the helical conformation. A Langevin
thermostat was used to maintain constant temperature, and heating
simulation was carried out using NAMD2.9.27 It was verified that the heating did not lead to any cis conformations of ω in the peptide backbone (Figure S1). The aspartates were protonated in VMD25 using the psfgen plugin, and these residues
were renamed as ASH as per the Amber naming convention. Convpdb28 was used to convert PDB files into the Amber
format, and Amber input files were generated using tleap.29 ff14SBonlysc10 and
mbondi3 intrinsic radii were used. Unnatural
amino acids were parameterized using the R.E.D. server.30 Briefly, a PDB file for the residue (along with
a N-terminal ACE patch and a C-terminal NME patch) was constructed
using Avogadro.31 “α”
and “β” conformers were generated by setting the
φ/Ψ values to −53/–47 and −119/119,
respectively, optimizing each structure using Gaussian0932 and uploading the results to the R.E.D. server.

Simulation
All simulations were run in Amber1629 using the GB-Neck2 implicit solvent model.11 Each peptide system was simulated for 2 μs.
Snapshots were taken every 5 ps, providing 400 data points for 2 μs
simulation time (similar to ref (10)). This sampling was used for each analysis,
except for the free energy and salt bridge analyses, which used snapshots
every 100 ps (i.e., 20 000 data points for the 2 μs simulation).

Analysis
Clustering:Trajectories were
grouped into 50 clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm in
cpptraj of AmberTools.29 The Cα atoms of residues 10–33 (putative binding domain as per ref (15)) were used for clustering.
The top (i.e., most populated) n clusters were selected
for analysis, where n was chosen to include ∼40%
of the trajectory. Helicity: A residue was defined
to be in helical conformation if it simultaneously satisfied the following
two conditions: −90 < φ < −30 and −77
< ψ < −17 (as per García and Sanbonmatsu33). A stretch was defined to be helical if three
or more consecutive residues satisfied the above-mentioned condition.
φ/ψ values were calculated in VMD using custom-made tcl
scripts. Contact maps: The distance between Cα atoms of residues was used. Distances were calculated
in VMD. Free energy analysis: For the number of contacts,
the contacts command in cpptraj was used to count the number of Cα atoms within 7 Å of a given Cα atom. The radius of gyration was calculated in VMD. All plots were
made using the matplotlib function of Python.34
