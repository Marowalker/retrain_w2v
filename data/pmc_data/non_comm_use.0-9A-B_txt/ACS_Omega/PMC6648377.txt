Various
electrolytes have been reported to enhance the reversibility
of Li-metal electrodes. However, for these electrolytes, concurrent
and balanced control of Li-metal and positive electrode interfaces
is a critical step toward fabrication of high-performance Li-metal
batteries. Here, we report the tuning of Li-metal and lithium cobalt
oxide (LCO) interfaces with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)-containing
electrolytes to achieve high cycling stability of Li/LCO batteries.
Reversibility of the Li-metal electrode is considerably enhanced for
electrolytes with high FEC contents, confirming the positive effect
of FEC on the stabilization of the Li-metal electrode. However, for
FEC contents of 50 wt % and above, the discharge capacity is significantly
reduced because of the formation of a passivation layer on the LCO
cathodes. Using balanced tuning of the two interfaces, stable cycling
over 350 cycles at 1.5 mA cm–2 is achieved for a
Li/LCO cell with the 1 M LiPF6 FEC/DEC = 30/70 electrolyte.
The enhanced reversibility of the Li-metal electrode is associated
with the formation of LiF and polycarbonate in the FEC-derived solid
electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. In addition, electrolytes with
high FEC contents lead to lateral Li deposition on the sides of Li
deposits and larger dimensions of rodlike Li deposits, suggesting
the elastic and ion-conductive nature of the FEC-derived SEI layer.

Introduction
Rechargeable lithium-metal
batteries have received great attention
because of their great potential to achieve high energy density based
on the low redox potential (−3.04 V vs standard hydrogen electrode)
and high theoretical capacity (3860 mA h g–1) of
the Li metal.1−4 Coupled with a high capacity cathode such as a sulfur and oxygen
cathode, a Li-metal anode can provide a specific energy density higher
than those possible with lithium-ion batteries.5−8 However, the practical use of
the Li metal for rechargeable batteries has not yet been fully realized
because of the deep-rooted problems of chronic Li dendrite growth
and poor Li-metal Coulombic efficiency (CE).9,10 The
irreversible reaction between the lithium metal and organic electrolyte
can be mitigated by forming a stable interface layer; with exposure
of a lithium-metal anode to an organic electrolyte, the decomposition
of the electrolyte results in the formation of a passivation layer
called a solid electrolyte interface (SEI), ideally preventing further
reaction between the organic electrolyte and lithium-metal anode.1,11 However, the original SEI layers are broken during the severe lithium
striping/plating process, and new SEI layers are formed on the fresh
lithium surface with continuous consumption of the electrolyte and
Li metal. As the result of the repetition of these processes, the
uneven SEI layers are piled up to form a thick layer on the surface
of the Li-metal anode, called a porous layer, which creates a large
resistance and eventually leads to cell failure.12−15 In the case of a silicon and
graphite anode, this uneven and resistive SEI layer formation has
been a critical issue for cycling stability.16−18 To prevent
the electrolyte decomposition and Li dendrite formation, coating of
a polymer composite protective layer19,20 or silicon
nanoparticles21 on the Li-metal anode has
been suggested. These approaches exploit the high shear modulus of
ceramic particles to mechanically suppress the growth of the Li dendrite.22,23 However, because of the existence of soft Li-ion conducting phases
or defects and consequent penetration of the Li dendrite through them,
the artificial protective layers do not perfectly prevent Li dendrite
growth. The other strategy is to form a stable SEI layer using an
electrolyte additive such as fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC),24 vinylidene carbonate,25 LiNO326 and polysulfides.27 These additives preferentially decompose on
the Li-metal surface, forming a robust SEI layer. The unique benefit
of the additive approach is that the defect in the SEI layer can be
healed by the remaining additives in the electrolytes until additives
are totally consumed. Among these additives, FEC is most widely known
as particularly effective at stabilizing lithium-metal anodes, as
well as silicon or graphite anodes; its ability to do this is attributed
to the formation of an SEI layer having Li-ion-conducting LiF and
elastic polycarbonate; LiF has an ionic conductivity of 10–7 to 10–13 S cm–1,28 and the polycarbonate imparts a flexibility
to the SEI layer, that is required to accommodate the significant
volume change of the lithium-metal and silicon anode.29 However, for Li metal and silicon anodes, the FEC additive
approach does not achieve long cycling stability due to the early
consumption of FEC.30 Considering this
limitation, the Zhang group proposed an electrolyte comprising FEC
solvent and LiNO3, which participate in Li solvation sheath
for making a stable SEI layer.31 In addition,
Aurbach’s group used FEC as a main solvent and demonstrated
an extended cycling stability for silicon anodes with the FEC/DMC
electrolyte.32 Very recently, they reported
that the FEC/DMC-based electrolyte system is also effective for lithium-metal
batteries;33 an Li/Li symmetric cell with
the FEC-based electrolyte was cycled at 2 mA cm–2 for more than 1100 cycles. Moreover, the FEC-based electrolyte was
used for practical loading of the NCM cathode about 3.3 mA h cm–2.34 However, they did not
clarify in detail the negative effects of the FEC solvent for use
in the cathode-electrode interface.

In this work, we report
the tuning of the Li metal and lithium
cobalt oxide (LCO) interface with FEC-containing electrolytes to achieve
a Li/LCO battery with excellent cycling stability. Ionic conductivity
measurement and cycling tests for Li/Cu and Li/LCO cells were conducted
with the FEC-containing electrolytes to verify the positive effect
of FEC on Li-metal stabilization. We also assessed the compatibility
with the LCO cathode of the FEC-containing electrolytes. To deepen
the understanding of the SEI layer derived from FEC-based electrolytes
and the resulting Li deposit morphology, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), impedance, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses
were carried out. This contribution will emphasize the importance
of the control of both LCO and Li interfaces to achieve high-performance
lithium-metal batteries with an FEC-based electrolyte, and of the
formation of an ion-conductive and elastic SEI layer with FEC-based
electrolytes to enhance the reversibility of the Li-metal electrode.

Results
and Discussion
Scheme 1 depicts
the FEC decomposition process on Li-metal anode and LCO cathode surfaces.
On the anode side, because of the highly reactive Li-metal, the FEC-contained
electrolyte is decomposed to form an SEI. The SEI from FEC is mainly
composed of LiF and polycarbonate; LiF is well known to induce uniform
Li-ion flux on the surface and the polycarbonate to impart flexibility
to the SEI.2 The uniform Li+ flux through the LiF-containing SEI layer can suppress the growth
of Li dendrites because the lithium dendrite growth is accelerated
because of locally concentrated Li+ flux. In addition,
by mechanically suppressing the dendrite growth in the opposite direction,
the polycarbonate component enables the SEI layer to accommodate severe
volume change of the Li-metal. Therefore, decomposed FEC compounds
such as LiF and polycarbonate simultaneously prohibit dendrite growth
by forming a stable SEI on the Li metal. However, the FEC can be decomposed
on a cathode on which a resistive cathode electrolyte interface (CEI)
such as an ether-based organic compound is created. This CEI retards
lithium-ion conduction to the cathode-active material. Therefore,
tuning the two interfaces of the anode and the cathode, by adjusting
the amount of the FEC solvent, is important for advanced Li-metal
batteries. The increasing amount of FEC in the electrolyte is good
for the anode electrode, producing a stable SEI on the Li metal. However,
a large amount of FEC in the electrolyte accelerates the decomposition
of FEC on the cathode and produces resistive ether-based organic compounds.
Therefore, for the design of FEC-based electrolytes, FEC/diethylene
carbonate (DEC) ratios were varied at 30/70, 50/50, and 70/30 in the
volume ratio, with 1 M LiPF6 salt; these mixtures are denoted
30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC, and 70FEC/30DEC, respectively; 1 M LiPF6 EC/DEC (50/50) electrolyte was used as a control sample (0
wt %FEC).

Scheme 1 FEC-Based Electrolyte Decomposition Process on Anode
and Cathode
Surfaces
As the FEC decomposed
on the Li-metal by reduction reaction, the
FEC content effect was also observed, which could be related with
the chemical component change of the SEI layer of the Li-metal electrode.
A series of XPS analyses was conducted to characterize the SEI layer
formed with these electrolytes. After 10 iterations of galvanostatic
cycling at 1 mA cm–2, the XPS spectra of the washed
Li-metal surfaces were taken. As shown in Figure 1a–d, the F 1s spectra for the control
electrolyte and three FEC-based electrolytes (30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC,
and 70FEC/30DEC) showed three main peaks at 685.0, 687.0, and 689.5,
which correspond to LiF, LixPOyFz, and LiPF6, respectively. The LiF and LixPOyFz peaks may
come from the decomposition of the LiPF6 lithium salt,
and the LiPF6 peak from the residual LiPF6 salt.

Figure 1 (a–d)
F 1s XPS analysis and (e–h) O 1s XPS spectra
of the Li-metal electrode surfaces after 10 cycles for Li/Li symmetric
cells with control, 30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC, and 70FEC/30DEC electrolytes.

Compared with the control, the
FEC/DEC electrolytes exhibited stronger
LiF peaks; the peak intensity ratios of the peak height of the LixPOyFz and LiF peaks were considerably lower for the FEC/DEC
electrolytes than for the control. Because LixPOyFz originates from the decomposition of LiPF6, and LiF from
both LiPF6 and FEC, the lower peak intensity ratios indicate
that FEC strongly contributes to the formation of the SEI layer for
the FEC/DEC electrolytes. Therefore, the fluorine atomic percentage
of the FEC/DEC electrolyte was higher than that of the control electrolyte
in Figure S1. According to previous works
on FEC-derived SEI layers, FEC is decomposed into LiF and vinyl carbonate
(VC), and the VC is polymerized to form polycarbonate on lithium metal,
graphite, and silicon anode material.35 Therefore, the relatively high intensity of the LiF peak for the
FEC/DEC electrolytes can be understood. Figure 1e–h shows the O 1s XPS spectra of
the lithium-metal surfaces after 10 cycles. For the control electrolyte,
two major peaks at 531.5 and 533.5 eV were observed, which correspond
to carbonyl oxygen and ether oxygen groups of LiOCO2R,
respectively. The higher intensities of the LiOCO2R peak
for the control electrolyte indicate that the decomposition of EC-
and DEC-free solvents was more severe than the case for the FEC/DEC
electrolytes. On the other hand, the O 1s XPS spectra for the FEC/DEC
electrolytes showed a new peak at 535.5 eV, which corresponds to the
−COO– group from polycarbonate, together with the other
two peaks. The peak from polycarbonate again supports the contribution
of FEC on the SEI layer formation.

To investigate the FEC effect
on the cathode, chemical analysis
of the cathode is necessary. The oxidation potential of FEC has been
reported by density functional theory calculation to be 7.24 V, which
is higher than that of EC (6.95 V). However, in a real cell system,
the oxidation of EC and FEC can be expected at a lower potential because
of nucleophilic attacks of the cathode surface oxygen atoms.36 Generally, the anion salt in the electrolyte
coordinates more with the free solvent, which has a higher dielectric
constant. Therefore, the PF6– anion salt easily
coordinates with the FEC electrolyte and then provides the negative
charge to the coordinated solvent, which reaches the cathode electrode
more easily than does the other solvent, resulting in the preferential
reaction of FEC during the charging process.37 Therefore, a much greater amount of the FEC solvent can be decomposed
on the cathode side than when using the EC and DEC solvents.

To understand the side reaction between the FEC-based electrolyte
and the LCO cathode, we used XPS to analyze the LCO cathode after
10 cycles. As shown in Figure 2a–d, the O 1s spectra of the LCO cathodes reveal two
major peaks centered at 529 and 533 eV that correspond to the oxygen
in the metal oxide (LCO) and to the ether group (C–O–C),
respectively. Unlike the control sample shown in Figure 2a, the intensities of the ether
group (C–O–C) signal for the FEC-containing electrolyte
were strong, as observed in the O 1s XPS analysis. From the result
showing that the intensity of ether compounds such as poly(ethylene
oxide) organic compounds increases with increasing the FEC content,
we can conclude that FEC has a great influence on the formation of
the resistive CEI on the cathode surface. Therefore, the decomposition
of FEC on the cathode can be attributed to the Li/LCO cell performance,
such as the degree of discharge capacity and the capacity retention.
In addition, the F 1s and C 1s spectra of LCO are shown in Figure S2, respectively. From the F 1s spectra,
the peaks from LiF (685 eV) and from LixPOyFz (687
eV) were identified. The stronger LiF and LixPOyFz peaks observed for the FEC/DEC electrolytes are attributed to the
formation of the CEI layer from the FEC solvent. In C 1s spectra,
the peak from the ether bond (287 eV) was gradually increased with
the FEC content, supporting the formation of the ether-based CEI layer.
For further analysis of the electrolyte decomposition at the cathode,
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis is conducted (Figure S3). As shown in the FT-IR graph, there
is one strong characteristic bond at the position of 1143 cm–1 for the C–O–C stretching vibration of ether bonding,
which commonly lies in the range of 1250–1000 cm–1.38 The peak of the C–O bond from
the ether compound chemicals increased gradually with increasing the
FEC content. This observation of the greater amount of the ether compound
in the high FEC electrolyte coincides with the XPS results.

cycles for the Li/LCO half cells with (a) 0 wt % FEC, (b) 30FEC/70DEC,
(c) 50FEC/50DEC, and (d) 70FEC/30DEC electrolyte.

Achieving a high ionic conductivity is an important electrolyte
design issue; high degree of salt dissociation and high Li-ion mobility
are the two requirements for high ionic conductivity.39 By considering the balance between salt dissociation and
Li-ion mobility, a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) having a high
dielectric constant of 89.0 and a linear carbonate having low viscosity
is conventionally used for Li-ion batteries. For this reason, we selected
DEC, having a viscosity of 0.75 cps, as a low viscosity co-solvent
for the FEC-based electrolyte; we used 1 M LiPF6 EC/DEC
(5/5) electrolyte as a control sample (50EC/50DEC). In the design
of FEC-based electrolytes, FEC imparts a high dissociation of Li salt,
as EC does. The FEC/DEC ratios were varied among 30/70, 50/50, and
70/30 in volume; these samples are denoted as 30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC,
and 70FEC/30DEC, respectively. In addition, EC/DEC electrolytes with
FEC additives were also prepared; FEC was added to the control electrolyte
at 2 and 10 wt %.

Ionic conductivities of these electrolytes
were measured from the
impedances of the corresponding symmetric cells. As shown in the Nyquist
plots of the impedances (Figure S4a), the
FEC-containing electrolytes showed much smaller Ohmic resistances
compared with the control EC/DEC electrolyte and the electrolytes
with variation of the FEC content. From the Ohmic resistances and
the thickness of the porous separator, the ionic conductivities of
the electrolyte-filled separator were determined and are compared
in Figure S4b. The control electrolyte
has an ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10–3 S cm–1, which is approximately two times lower than those
for the 2 and 10 wt % FEC-containing 50EC/50DEC electrolytes. Because
the dielectric constant of FEC (110) is higher than that of EC, the
FEC-containing electrolytes have stronger Li-ion solvation power than
does the control, which explains the higher ion conductivities. The
FEC/DEC electrolytes also showed higher ionic conductivities: 4.79,
4.37, and 3.78 × 10–3 S cm–1 for 30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC, and 70FEC/30DEC, respectively. The
ion conductivity decreased with increasing the FEC content for the
FEC/DEC electrolytes and FEC additive-containing EC/DEC electrolytes;
this is attributed to the increased electrolyte viscosity with increasing
the FEC content. Therefore, the use of FEC as an additive or co-solvent
is highly beneficial in attaining high ionic conductivity, and the
30FEC/70DEC electrolyte has the highest ionic conductivity among all
samples. Furthermore, for investigating the wettability of the electrolytes
with the separator, we measured the contact angle of the liquid electrolyte
on the polypropylene (PP) separator by optical microscopy (Figure S5). A lower contact angle means a poorer
wettability with the separator. The control, 30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC,
70FEC/30DEC, and 90FEC/10DEC electrolyte showed a contact angle of
155°, 154°, 152°, 150°, and 138°, respectively.
For the FEC content of 70% and below, the contact angles are nearly
invariant, indicating similar wettability. On the other hand, the
relatively low contact angle for the 90FEC/10DEC electrolyte suggests
poorer wettability. Therefore, the FEC-containing electrolytes do
not practically suffer from the electrolyte wetting problem at the
FEC content of 70% or below.

To examine the reversibility of
the lithium stripping/plating process
for the electrolytes, galvanostatic cycling experiments were conducted
with the corresponding Li–Cu half-cells. Li-metal plating on
the Cu electrode was conducted at 1 mA cm–2 for
1 h and Li stripping from the Li deposit was carried out at the same
current density. According to the voltage profiles during the plating/stripping
(Figure 3a), the FEC-containing
electrolytes exhibited larger stripping capacity than the control
electrolyte, indicating an improved reversibility. The CE at the first
cycle was 87.6, 95.4, 91.3, 93.8, 93.8, 96.1, and 96.0% for the control
(0 wt % FEC), 2 wt % FEC, 10 wt % FEC, 30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC, and
70FEC/30DEC, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the
FEC-containing electrolytes have better reversibility for Li plating/stripping
on Cu than does the control electrolyte.

cycle of the Li/Cu cells with 0 wt % FEC (control), 2 wt % FEC, 10
wt % FEC, 30FEC/70DEC, 50FEC/50DEC, and 70FEC/30DEC electrolytes.
(b) CEs of the Li/Cu cells as a function of the cycle number measured
at 1 mA cm–-2 and 1 mA h cm–2.

The long-term cycling stability
of the Li plating/stripping process
was assessed for the electrolytes; the CEs were measured during an
extended cycle number, as shown in Figure 3b. The CE of the control electrolyte dramatically
decreased after 10 cycles, which means that the control electrolyte
is highly unstable with the Li-metal electrode. The addition of FEC
additive at 2 and 10 wt % to the control electrolyte resulted in 2
and 3 times improvement of the cycling stability, respectively. For
the FEC/DEC electrolytes, the cycling stabilities considerably improved
compared with that of the control electrolyte and were even better
than those of the FEC additive-containing electrolytes. Among those
three FEC/DEC electrolytes, the 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte showed better
cycling stability than did the 50FEC/50DEC and 70FEC/30DEC electrolytes;
CE for the 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte was maintained at a 95.5% value
even after 200 cycles. The averaged CEs for the initial 60 cycles
are compared in Table S1 for the FEC/DEC
electrolytes. The CEs were considerably higher for the electrolytes
with high a FEC content (EC/DEC + 10 wt % FEC and FEC/DEC electrolytes)
than for the control or the control with 2 wt % FEC electrolyte. This
suggests that a stable SEI can be made when the FEC content exceeds
a certain value. We believe that the best cycling stability, observed
for the 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte, is attributed to the highest ionic
conductivity and the high stability of the corresponding SEI layer.
When the ionic conductivity is low, Li+ flux is concentrated
at defects or specific sites with lower surface resistance, resulting
in uneven Li deposition/plating and consequently low cycling stability.40

To demonstrate the applicability of the
FEC-containing electrolytes
for lithium-metal batteries, we employed Li metal/LCO cells. Figure 4a compares the discharge
capacities of Li/LCO cells with the control and FEC-containing electrolytes.
The Li/LCO cell with the control electrolyte showed poor capacity
retention; the discharge capacity dramatically decreased after the
60th cycle at 1.5 mA cm–2 current density (1 C).
As shown in Figure 4b, the CE of the LCO cell with the control electrolyte decreased
after the 60th cycle; this result strongly correlates with the discharge
capacity results. The 2 wt % FEC-containing EC/DEC electrolyte exhibited
an improved capacity retention and higher CE (>99%) retention up
to
the 100th cycle compared with the control cell (Figure 4a,b); however, the cell eventually showed
significant capacity, and CE fades after the 150th cycle. Comparison
of the 2 and 10 wt % FEC-containing electrolytes shows that the capacity
retention and reversibility were highly enhanced with the increase
of the FEC content from 2 to 10 wt %. Even at the 350th cycle, the
10 wt % FEC-containing electrolyte maintained 89.3% of its initial
capacity with a CE of 98%, which suggests the formation of a highly
stable SEI layer. For the FEC/DEC electrolytes, the discharge capacity
strongly depended on the FEC content; with increasing the FEC content,
the initial discharge capacity decreased. Interesting to us was that
the 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte delivered a high initial discharge capacity,
comparable to that of the control, and an excellent capacity retention
of 97.5% at the 350th cycle, with a CE of 99.8%. At an FEC content
of 50% and above, the CEs in early cycling were quite unstable, indicating
the occurrence of a side reaction. Although the electrolytes showed
high cycling stability of the Li-metal electrode, side reaction of
FEC at the LCO cathode may cause the lower initial discharge capacities.41 To verify the FEC decomposition and consequent
LCO passivation for the electrolytes with high FEC contents, we also
conducted a three-electrode impedance analysis for the Li/LCO cells
with the control and 70FEC/30DEC electrolytes. As shown in Figure S6a, the cathode impedances for the control
and 70FEC/30DEC electrolytes in the fully charged state after the
first cycle exhibited two semicircles; the high frequency (500 Hz)
and low frequency (5 Hz) semicircles are associated with Li+ ion migration through a CEI film and with the charge-transfer process,
respectively. The diameters of the high frequency and low frequency
semicircles correspond to SEI film resistance and charge-transfer
resistance, respectively.42 The comparison
of the control and 70FEC/30DEC electrolytes clearly shows that the
SEI film resistance of 70FEC/30DEC is much larger than that of the
control, supporting the formation of a more resistive SEI layer for
70FEC/30DEC. The XPS and impedance results collectively suggest that
the small discharge capacity of the 70FEC/30DEC electrolyte originate
from the SEI formation at the cathode. As shown in Figure S6b, the impedances after the 1st and 30th cycles were
nearly identical, which informs that the CEI layer is stably preserved
during the cycling after being formed at the first cycle. Although
the discharge capacities of the 50FEC/50DEC and 70FEC/DEC electrolytes
were smaller because of the CEI formation, their cycling stabilities
were quite high, as shown in Figure 4a, because of their Li-metal electrode stabilization.
As a result of the balanced SEI control for the Li metal and LCO electrodes,
the LCO cell with the 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte showed high initial
capacity and the highest capacity retention.

Plot of (a) discharge capacities and (b) CEs of the Li/LCO cells cycled
at 1.0 C rate as a function of the cycle number.

For a deeper understanding of the excellent capacity retention
of the 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte, we investigated the evolution of the
Li-metal electrode impedance with cycling for Li/LCO cells with control
and 30FEC/70DEC electrolytes. A Li-metal reference electrode was inserted
into the cell for the analysis. As shown in Figure 5a, the Li-metal electrode impedances for
the control electrolyte are featured by two partially overlapped semicircles.
According to previous publications, the high-frequency semicircle
(200 Hz) is assigned to Li-ion conduction through the SEI layer and
the low frequency semicircle (3 Hz) is assigned to charge-transfer
process.43 A circuit model used for the
assignment is given in the figures for a better understanding. The
size of the semicircles decreased considerably with the cycle in early
cycling because inhomogeneous Li deposition/dissolution accompanies
an expansion of the Li-metal electrode surface. However, after the
30th cycle, the interfacial and charge-transfer impedances dramatically
increased, which indicates the filing up of the resistive porous layers
on the lithium-metal surfaces. The inset photo of the lithium-metal
surface after 100 cycles clearly shows the porous layer. On the other
hand, as shown in Figure 5b, the lithium-metal electrode impedances for the 30FEC/70DEC
electrolyte system were quite different from those for the control.
The two semicircles were highly overlapped, and the overall magnitudes
of the merged semicircles were considerably smaller than those for
the control. More importantly, the impedances were stably maintained
with the cycle. These results suggest that the SEI layer of the Li-metal
electrode derived from FEC is quite stable even for the Li/LCO cell.
As shown in the inset, the porous layer formed on the lithium-metal
surface after 100 cycles was thinner than that for the control.

of the impedances of the Li-metal electrodes in three-electrode
configuration measured at various cycles for (a) control electrolyte
and (b) 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte. (Inset: Photo images of a lithium-metal
anode after 100 cycles).

For the control and FEC-containing electrolytes, the positive
effect
of FEC on the stabilization of the Li-metal electrode motivated us
to investigate the morphology of the Li-metal electrode after cycling.
Although the relationship between the SEI layer and the resulting
Li morphology has not been made clear yet, we expect that the Li-ion
conductivity and the mechanical property of the SEI layer are critical
in the evolution of the Li-metal morphology during repeated cycling.
A highly ion-conductive and elastic SEI layer would permit Li deposition
under the SEI layer and could withstand the resulting volume expansion
to some extent, resulting in thicker and larger Li deposits. After
10 cycles at 1 mA cm–2 and 1 mA h cm–2, the Li/Li symmetric cells were disassembled and the surface of
the cycled Li-metal electrodes were observed using SEM. As shown in Figure 6a, for the control
electrolyte, submicron-sized mossy and needle-like Li dendrites were
observed. According to the Li morphology, it appears that the preformed
lithium dendrites were not readily expanded by lateral Li deposition,
but new dendrites were formed from any defects in the preformed SEI.
Such Li deposition should result in the expansion of the Li surface
and should accelerate the reaction of the electrolyte and Li metal,
lowering the CE, as observed for the Li/Cu and Li/LCO tests. When
FEC was added to the control electrolyte at 2 and 10 wt %, the diameters
of the lithium dendrites were larger than that of the control (Figure 6b,c). The higher
FEC content resulted in thicker lithium dendrites. For the three FEC/DEC
electrolytes, thicker lithium dendrites with diameters of around 1
μm were observed (Figure 6d–f). This morphological feature can be understood
by considering the LiF and carbonate components in the SEI layers
derived from FEC. The Li-ion-conducting LiF components permit Li-ion
transport through the SEI layer and the elastic carbonate compound
accommodates the resulting volume expansion of Li dendrites. Because
the Li-metal surfaces are less expanded and the SEI layers are more
stably preserved, electrolytes with relatively high FEC contents can
improve the CE and cycling stability.

electrolytes.

Conclusions
High
cycling stability of Li/LCO batteries was achieved by tuning
FEC-containing electrolytes. Above a certain FEC content, stabilization
of Li-metal electrodes was clearly observed. Among the electrolytes
investigated, the 1 M LiPF6 30FEC/70DEC electrolyte showed
the highest ionic conductivity and the highest cycling stability for
the Li/LCO and Li/Cu cell test. At an FEC content of 50 wt % and above,
a considerable reduction of initial discharge capacity was observed
because of the formation of a resistive layer on the LCO surface,
indicating the existence of an optimum FEC content for the design
of LCO-based lithium-metal batteries. The Li/LCO cell with the 30FEC/70DEC
electrolyte showed a capacity retention of 97.5% and CE of 99.0% even
after 300 cycles, demonstrating the importance of tuning the two interfaces.
XPS analysis clearly showed that the FEC-derived SEI layers include
LiF and polycarbonates. The diameters of the noodle-like Li deposits
observed for the FEC/DEC electrolytes were an order of magnitude larger
than those of the EC/DEC electrolyte. The resulting Li deposit for
the FEC/DEC electrolyte suggests that the resulting SEI layer is ion-conductive
and elastic.

Experimental Section
Measurement of Ionic Conductivity
of the Electrolyte
Ionic conductivity of the electrolyte
was determined from ac impedances
of an SUS/PP separator/SUS symmetric cell containing electrolyte.
The thickness of the PP separator is 20 μm and the diameter
of the SUS disc electrode is 0.8 cm. The excess 200 μL of electrolyte
is injected to the 2032 type coin cell.

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical performance
measurements were carried out using 2032 coin-type cells. Li-metal
batteries were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox consisting of
the electrodes, a PP separator (PP2400, Celgard, USA), and an electrolyte
(PANAX ETEC Co. Ltd, South Korea), and 100 μL of lithium hexafluorophosphate
(LiPF6, 1 M) in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate
(EC/DEC, 1:1 by volume) was used as the electrolyte for every electrochemical
cell test. The LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode was prepared by casting
a slurry consisting of 90 wt % LCO (Umicore Co. Ltd, South Korea),
5 wt % SUPER P carbon black (Timcal, Switzerland), 5 wt % polyvinylidene
fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) binder, and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
as a solvent onto an Al foil. We used the 450 μm thickness of
the lithium metal (Honjo Metal), and the areal capacity of the LCO
cathode is 1.5 mA h cm–2. Galvanostatic experiments
were performed using a battery cycler (WBCS 3000, WonATech, South
Korea), and the cells were placed in an environmental chamber in which
the temperature was controlled at 25 °C. To examine the performance
of the Li/LCO cell, the assembled cells were operated at 0.15 mA cm–2 current density for charge and discharge formation
cycle and the cell was cycled at 1.5 mA cm–2 current
density. The cutoff voltages for charging and discharging were 4.2
and 3.0 V versus Li/Li+, respectively. Electrochemical
impedance spectra measurements were performed using a Solartron 1255
(Solartron Analytical, UK) frequency response analyzer and a Solartron
1287 electrochemical workstation in the frequency range of 1 MHz to
0.1 Hz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV.

Morphological and Chemical
Bonding Characterizations
The morphology of the Li-metal
electrodes was examined by field-emission
SEM (Sirion, FEI). In a dry glovebox filled with argon, the Li-metal
electrodes were carefully separated from the disassembled cells after
electrochemical investigations. To remove any residual electrolyte,
the obtained electrodes were gently rinsed with 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(anhydrous, 99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and dried under vacuum overnight.
The samples were vacuum-sealed in a PP bottle for safe transfer without
contamination and exposed to air only for a few seconds at sample
loading. To prevent Li-metal contamination, the bonding characterizations
of the electrode surface were carried out via FT-IR (IFS66V/S-HYPERION
300, Bruker Optic) and XPS (Sigma Probe, Thermo VG Scientific) in
a vacuum chamber. The FT-IR analysis was carried out in the wave number
range of 2000–900 cm–1, and XPS spectra were
calibrated against the hydrocarbon peak at a binding energy of 285.0
eV.
