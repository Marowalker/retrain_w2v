The
demand for fresh water has been increasing, caused by the growing
population and industrialization throughout the world. In this study,
we report a capacitive-based desalination system using Prussian blue
materials in a rocking chair desalination battery, which is composed
of sodium nickel hexacyanoferrate (NaNiHCF) and sodium iron HCF (NaFeHCF)
electrodes. In this system, ions are removed not only by charging
steps but also by discharging steps, and it is possible to treat actual
seawater with this system because the Prussian blue material has a
high charge capacity with a reversible reaction of alkaline cations.
Here, we demonstrate a rocking chair desalination battery to desalt
seawater, and the results show that this system has a high desalination
capacity (59.9 mg/g) with efficient energy consumption (0.34 Wh/L
for 40% Na ion removal efficiency).

1 Introduction
The
demand for fresh water has been increasing, caused by the growing
population and industrialization throughout the world, which has led
to the importance of securing water resources. However, the amount
of available fresh water has been decreasing due to environmental
contamination and climate change. Currently, converting seawater to
fresh water is considered to be a solution for the water shortage
crisis because the oceans comprise over 97% of the water on the earth.
Therefore, the development of a desalination technology is required
for a sustainable water supply.1−3 Seawater desalination technologies
using thermal distillation and reverse osmosis (RO) have been investigated
but require high power (3–4 kW for 0.7 m3/h fresh
water production),4 high operation costs
for membrane replacement, and large-scale infrastructure, which limit
their application in underdeveloped countries and small islands. In
addition, the energy consumption of conventional desalination processes
is still high, even though RO is presently considered to be the most
energy-efficient desalination technology for desalting seawater (3–4
Wh/L).3−8 Therefore, the development of a novel desalination technology that
is energy efficient and convenient to operate with simple equipment
is necessary.

To overcome the limitations of a conventional
desalination process,
capacitive-based electrochemical desalination techniques have been
of interest as alternative desalination processes because of their
high energy efficiency for brackish water deionization (∼1
g TDS/L),6 simple equipment, and environmentally
friendly characteristics. Capacitive deionization (CDI) is one of
many electrochemical desalination technologies that use carbon materials,
and ions from salt water are removed by electrical adsorption on the
surface of electrodes.2,6,9−23 Although CDI shows good performance to desalt brackish water, it
is difficult to apply for the desalination of high-salt-concentration
solutions because the amount of salt adsorption is limited by the
capacity of the carbon materials.

Recently, battery material-based
desalination techniques, such
as a desalination battery,24 hybrid capacitive
deionization (HCDI),25,26 and symmetric Na-ion desalination
(NID) systems,27 have been reported for
treating high-salinity water; in these systems, ions are removed by
a chemical reaction with the battery materials. A desalination battery,
which is the first seawater desalination system to use battery materials,
consists of sodium manganese oxide (Na2Mn5O10) and silver electrodes. In this system, sodium and chloride
ions are captured by the chemical reaction, and it is operated by
a four-step charge/discharge process. During the charging process
(step 1), the ions in seawater are removed by the intercalation reaction
of sodium manganese oxide and the silver/silver chloride reaction. After exchange of the deionized water with the source water (step
2), the discharged cells are recharged, releasing captured ions and
producing a concentrated solution (step 3). The brine is then exchanged
with the source water, and the cell is ready for the desalination
step (step 4). Although the battery system has an efficient energy
consumption for seawater desalination (0.29 Wh/L for the 25% salt-removal
efficiency),24 its economic impact is limited
due to the high price of silver. The HCDI system uses a battery electrode,
an anion-exchange membrane, and an activated carbon electrode. The
ion removal performance of the HCDI system shows a high ion removal
capacity and a rapid ion removal rate compared to those of a typical
CDI, but the ion removal capacity of HCDI is still limited by the
carbon material. Symmetric NID is a simulated system that operates
in a similar manner to electrodialysis using a porous sodium manganese
oxide (Na0.44MnO2) electrode with an anion-selective
membrane. In this system, Na ions are captured in the battery material,
whereas Cl ions are removed by diffusion through the anion-selective
membrane. From the modeling data, NID has a remarkable energy efficiency
(0.74 kWh/m3 for seawater-level NaCl) with the possibility
of a high water recovery rate (maximum: 95% water recovery).27 However, the symmetric system is difficult to
use due to the uncertain charging/discharging step but also because
Na0.44MnO2 has a low specific charge capacity
(35 mAh/g); there are also competing intercalation reactions with
alkaline cations (K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+).

Here, we investigated a novel, simple, and high-efficiency
desalination
system using Prussian blue electrodes. Figure 1 represents the principle of the rocking
chair desalination battery; this system consists of sodium nickel
hexacyanoferrate (NaNiHCF) and sodium iron HCF (NaFeHCF) electrodes
for capturing cations, and there are two solution compartments, which
are formed by an anion-exchange membrane in the cell. The system operates
similar to rocking chair batteries, as shown by the movement of ions
during the charging and discharging steps; however, the anion-exchange
membrane blocks cation movement into another solution, whereas anions
pass through the anion-exchange membrane by diffusion, inducing a
charge imbalance of the solutions. From the ion movement in the
cell, the solutions are concentrated and diluted during both the charging
and discharging steps, and it does not require a regeneration step
that creates brine in a desalination battery. Prussian blue analogues
AxM[Fe(CN)6] (A: alkali cations,
M: transition metal ions) have an open framework structure with the
large cages surrounded by an Fe—C≡N—Fe bridge,
and it allows to react with various cations, including K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, which are the main alkaline
ions in seawater.28,29 They are suitable materials for
aqueous batteries because of their reversible reaction, long life
cycle, and high specific capacity.30,31 Furthermore,
they have the characteristics of being environmentally benign and
of low cost,32 meaning that they can be
applied for the capacitive-based desalination technology. In this
work, a rocking chair desalination battery that consists of two Prussian
blue materials was used for the electrochemical desalination process,
and the salt removal performance and electrochemical properties were
evaluated using actual seawater.

Figure 1 Principle of a rocking chair desalination
battery. In the charging
step, the cations in the negative compartment solution are captured
by a chemical reaction with the negative electrode, whereas cations
intercalated into the positive electrode are released into the positive
compartment solution. Anions in the negative compartment solution
pass through the anion-exchange membrane by diffusion. After exchange
of the treated water with the source water, the solutions are diluted
and concentrated by the reverse movement of ions during the discharging
step.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Synthesis of Prussian Blue Materials
The Prussian blue
materials used in this study were synthesized by
a controlled crystallization reaction with citrate ions to obtain
an ordered nanocube structure. NaNiHCF particles were prepared by
mixing 100 mL of a 0.05 M NiCl2 + 0.35 M Na-citrate solution
and 100 mL of a 0.05 M Na4Fe(CN)6 solution under
vigorous stirring. The reaction was carried out for 24 h at room temperature,
and the obtained solution was aged for 20 h at room temperature. The
precipitated products were filtered and washed with distilled water
and ethanol several times, and the collected particles were dried
in an oven at 70 °C under a vacuum condition. NaFeHCF particles
were synthesized by mixing 100 mL of a 0.05 M FeCl2 + 0.20
M Na-citrate solution and 100 mL of a 0.05 M Na4Fe(CN)6 solution. The mixing solution was stirred for 3 h and aged
for 20 h at room temperature. The resulting particles were filtered
and rinsed with distilled water and ethanol several times and then
dried in an oven at 70 °C to eliminate the remaining solvent.
The prepared particles were characterized using inductively coupled
plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES; VARIAN 730ES, Australia),
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JEOL JSM 6700
F, Japan), and X-ray powder diffraction (D8 Discover). All of the
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation.

2.2 Electrode Fabrication and Cell Assembly
The NaNiHCF
and NaFeHCF electrodes were made by mixing 70 wt %
active material, 20 wt % carbon black (Super P, Timcal, Switzerland),
and 10 wt % poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE; Sigma-Aldrich) in an
ethanol solvent. The resulting slurry was pressed using a roll press
machine to obtain sheet-type electrodes with a thickness of approximately
300 μm. The fabricated Prussian blue electrodes were dried using
a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h to eliminate the remaining solvent.
Rectangular-shaped NaNiHCF (2.0 cm × 2.0 cm, weight: 90 ±
5 mg) was used as the positive electrode, and the same-sized NaFeHCF
(2.0 cm × 2.0 cm, weight: 86 ± 4 mg) rectangle was used
as a negative electrode. The Prussian blue electrodes were attached
onto titanium plates (thickness: 0.20 mm; Sigma-Aldrich) using carbon
paint (DAG-T-502; Ted Pella). The rocking chair desalination battery
consisted of two Prussian blue electrodes, an anion-exchange membrane
(AMX; ASTOM Co., Japan), and polyamide woven spacers (2.0 cm ×
2.0 cm, thickness: 0.6 mm). The electrolyte of the cell consisted
of a positive-electrode compartment and a negative-electrode compartment
divided by the anion-exchange membrane, as shown in Figure S3, and the volume of each compartment is approximately
0.4 cm3. Before assembling the cell, the NaFeHCF electrode was charged to 0.3 V for 30
min in a 0.5 M NaCl solution using a three-electrode cell with a Ag/AgCl
(KCl sat′) reference electrode and a stainless steel counter
electrode to extract Na ions from NaFeHCF to obtain a ready-to-use
negative electrode. The cell was covered by a PTFE plate and silicon
rubber. To avoid the negative cell voltage during the discharging
step, the battery cell was precharged in a 0.5 M NaCl solution at
a constant current (2 mA) for 10 min before starting the test. The
seawater used in this study was obtained from the East Sea (Sockcho,
Gangwon Province, Korea).

2.3 Desalination Performance
Test
To
probe the possibility of application for seawater desalination processes,
0.6 mL of seawater was put into the positive and negative compartment
of the cell (0.3 mL in each compartment). The desalination process
was conducted at a constant current (±0.5 mA/cm2)
for 1 h (removal of 40% Na ions) and 40 min (removal of 25% Na ions).
Each solution in the positive and negative compartments was extracted
and exchanged with virgin seawater (0.3 mL in each compartment) by
reassembling the cell after the charging and discharging processes.
To investigate the maximum ion removal capacity, an additional experiment
was carried out at constant current operation (±0.5 mA/cm2) in a 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solution with a voltage range of
0.05–0.85 V, and the results of the desalination performance
are provided in the Supporting Information (see Figure S2 and Table S2). The concentration of various ions
was measured by ion chromatography (ICS-1100 and DX-120; Dionex) with
50 μL of samples after each process. The desalination results
from triplicate experiments with standard deviations are presented
in this work.

Energy consumption during the operation can be
calculated by the amount of energy consumed during the charging step
minus the energy generated during the discharging step and is demonstrated
by the path integral of a voltage versus charge plot, as given by
previous research24,33−36 1  where ΔV is the cell
voltage (V) and q is the charge (C) during the operation.

The ion removal efficiency reported in the table is based on the
equation 2  where ci is the
ion concentration of the initial source water and ct is the ion concentration of treated water. The Na ion
removal efficiency of the solution was represented by the average
removal efficiency percent of Na ions by repeating the first cycle
of the system using virgin Prussian blue electrodes.

The efficiency
of salt removal per total charge is expressed by
the Coulombic efficiency according to the following equation 3  where zi is the
ion valance, F is the Faraday constant, nI – nF is the molar
change in ions, and ∑ is the total charge transferred at the
charging and discharging steps.

2.4 Electrochemical
Characterization
The electrochemical performance of the Prussian
blue electrodes was
examined in an electrochemical cell that was manufactured with a pair
of graphite current collectors (d = 18 mm) and a
glass fiber separator (GF/A; Whatman), as shown in the Supporting
Information (see Figure S4). Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) was performed in a 1 M NaCl solution or seawater with a three-electrode
system. Round Prussian blue electrodes (d = 9 mm)
were used as the working electrode, and the reference electrode was
a Ag/AgCl (KCl sat′) electrode. A sheet-type Ag/AgCl electrode
(d = 18 mm) with a large specific capacity was used
as the counter electrode. Galvanostatic charging/discharging tests
were carried out using a two-electrode or three-electrode cell in
seawater electrolytes, and, before the test, 0.3 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was
applied to the NaFeHCF electrode for 30 min in a 0.5 M NaCl solution.
NaNiHCF and NaFeHCF electrodes were used as positive and negative
electrodes. In a three-electrode cell, a Ag/AgCl (KCl sat′)
electrode was used. To examine the stability of the NaNiHCF and NaFeHCF
cell in seawater, a galvanostatic cycling test was conducted in an
electrochemical cell at a current of ±1.05 mA (0.1 A/g of NaFeHCF)
in a voltage range of 0.10–0.80 V. The electrochemical analyses
were conducted using a battery cycler (WBCS3000; WonA Tech, Korea).

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2a,b shows
the voltage profiles during the charging and discharging steps at
a current density of ±0.5 mA/cm2 for 1 h in seawater,
as well as the corresponding voltage versus charge plots, respectively.
As shown in Figure 2a, the NaNiHCF/NaFeHCF cell shows a reversible redox reaction in
the seawater electrolyte, and it is indicated that the cell can work
as a secondary battery during the desalination process. The electrochemical
reaction during the charging and discharging process is as follows

discharging 6   7  where xsol(−)Na+ is the sodium ions in the
negative compartment and
intercalated into the NaFeHCF electrode, and xsol(+)Na+ is the sodium ions in positive compartment
and intercalated into the NaNiHCF electrode. From the property of the Prussian
blue electrode, it can be observed that cations in the solution are
intercalated into the electrode, whereas cations inserted at another
electrode are released into the solution. The NaNiHCF/NaFeHCF cell
operates as a rocking chair battery, and it is possible to desalt
a solution not only during charging but also during discharging, by
adding an anion-selective membrane. If a conventional porous separator
is used instead of anion-exchange membrane, a desalination performance
of the system would be limited by cation movement into another compartment
during the operation. The voltage drop (approximately 0.06 V) between
the charging and discharging steps indicates the polarization though
the solid–liquid interface and resistance in the cell caused
by the electrode, the electrolyte, and the ion-exchange membrane.

Table 1 shows the
various ion concentrations of source water (seawater) and a desalted
solution during the charging or discharging steps. From the ion concentration
changes of the dilute solution, the battery system can desalt the
source water not only when discharging but also when charging the
system. The average removal efficiency of Na ions during one cycle,
which is a major component of seawater, is approximately 40%. The
total energy consumed during the operation is 725 mJ (deionized water
volume: 0.6 mL), and the energy required per 1 L of seawater is 0.34
Wh with 50% water recovery (the percent of seawater converted to treated
water). The Coulombic efficiencies of cations and anions are 83.5
and 83.1%, respectively. The observed desalination performance of
the system demonstrates that it can desalt both monovalent and multivalent
ions because the Prussian blue materials have different reversible
intercalation and deintercalation potentials with various cations.29 Considering the number of desalting ions, the
Prussian blue materials have a higher affinity for monovalent ions
than multivalent ions due to the expectation of electrostatic repulsion.37 To compare the desalination performance to that
of a previous study, we carried out an additional experiment in which
the average Na removal efficiency was approximately 25% using seawater
(see Figure S1 and Table S1). The energy
consumed during the desalination process is 299 mJ during one cycle,
and the energy required for treating 1 L of seawater is 0.14 Wh. This
value is a remarkable result compared to that of previous research
using a battery system (0.29 Wh/L).24

The maximum desalination
capacity, which is an important parameter
in capacitive-based electrochemical desalination technologies (calculated
as the mass of deionized NaCl (mg) divided by the total mass of the
electrodes (g)), was measured from an additional test at a voltage
range of 0.05–0.85 V in a 0.5 M NaCl aqueous solution (see Figure S2 and Table S2). From one cycle of the
desalination process, the average deionized NaCl concentration is
298 mM and the desalination capacity is approximately 59.9 mg/g. Note
that the mass of salt removal in the system was the total amount of
deionized NaCl during one cycle of the process (charging and discharging
steps). This excellent desalination
performance is explained by the fact that the system can deionize
the source water during both the charging and discharging steps, as
it overcomes a limitation of energy efficiency and capacity among
electrochemical desalination processes, which have a separate regeneration
and create brine.

Figure 3a,b shows
the FESEM images of as-prepared NaNiHCF and NaFeHCF. To obtain ordered
nanocube particles, we synthesized Prussian blue materials using kinetically
controlled crystallization, which is a controllable crystal growth
method that uses the addition of sodium citrate, as reported in previous
research.38,39 In this method, sodium citrate served as
a chelating agent that is coordinated with metal ions, and, then,
the slowly released metal ions from the citrate complex are reacted
with hexacyanoferrate ions. This slow nucleation and crystal growth
allows for the formation of well-shaped nanocube particles, and the
particle size can be controlled by adjusting the amount of citrate
ions. From the SEM images, the morphology of the Prussian blue particles
appears to be a well-crystallized nanocube structure that has a size
distribution of 300–500 nm. Figure 3c shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared
NaNiHCF and NaFeHCF. The XRD pattern of NaNiHCF reveals that diffraction
lines of NaNiHCF with indexes of 220, 420, 440, and 620 exhibit as
a doublet by comparison with the structured Fe4[Fe(CN)6]3 (JCPDS 52-1970). Supported by the ICP-AES analysis
results (the Na/(Ni + Fe) molar ratio of NaNiHCF and the Na/Fe molar
ratio of NaFeHCF are 0.85/1 and 0.72/1, respectively), this distortion
of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure is interpreted by the presence
of an excess amount of Na ions in the Prussian blue lattice, which
indicates a rhombohedral structure.40−42 The XRD peaks of NaFeHCF
have a strong line and are well indexed to an fcc structure (JCDPDS
73-0687), which indicates the high crystallinity of NaFeHCF particles.

Figure 4 shows the
electrochemical properties of the Prussian blue electrodes characterized
by CV and galvanostatic charging/discharging in an electrochemical
cell. The CV curves of the NaFeHCF and NaNiHCF electrodes in Figure 4a appear as broad
redox peaks between −0.1 to 0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) and 0.4 to 0.6
V (vs Ag/AgCl); also, similar redox reaction properties are observed
in both 1 M NaCl and seawater electrolytes. As expected from the difference
of the redox reaction potential, the rechargeable battery system can
be composed of NaNiHCF as a positive electrode and NaFeHCF as a negative
electrode. Figure 4b,c shows the galvanostatic performance of the NaNiHCF/NaFeHCF full
cell and the potential profiles of each electrode using a three-electrode
system with a silver/silver chloride (KCl sat′) reference electrode
in seawater. Closely related to the CV results, the Prussian blue
electrodes exhibit a similar redox reaction potential plateau at −0.1
to 0.3 V in the negative electrode and 0.4–0.8 V in the positive
electrode.

electrolytes (current density: 0.1 A/gNaFeHCF). (d) Galvanostatic
cycling performance of the NaNiHCF/NaFeHCF full cell in seawater (current
density: 0.1 A/gNaFeHCF).

Figure 4d
shows
the galvanostatic cycling performance of the NaNiHCF/NaFeHCF full
cell at a current density of 0.1 A/gnegative between 0.10
and 0.80 V in a seawater solution. As shown in the results, the initial
charge capacity was 56.2 mAh/gnegative, which is higher
than that of manganese oxide-based materials, such as Na0.44MnO2 and Na2Mn5O10 (35
mAh/g), that are used for capacitive-based desalination technologies.
The retained capacity remains at 91.5% after 100 cycles, and the Coulombic
efficiency stays above 92% (average: 92.9%), indicating its good stability
even though the electrolyte was seawater without any oxygen removal
treatment. These results suggest that the Prussian blue materials
have good cycling stability in a mixed electrolyte solution containing
various ion species due to the large size of the open framework structure.29,30

4 Conclusions
In this study, a rocking chair
desalination battery was developed
using NaNiHCF and NaFeHCF electrodes. This system desalts the source
water at both the charge and discharge steps. This principle of the
system contributes not only to a high desalination capacity but also
efficient energy consumption. As demonstrated in this work, the system
shows a high Na ion removal efficiency (40%) and excellent energy
efficiency (0.34 Wh/L) for seawater desalination. In addition, it
was found that the system has a high desalination capacity (59.9 mg/g)
with good stability in seawater. Although the demonstrated work
shows low water treatment capacity with a low water recovery ratio,
we believe that it is possible to enhance the water treatment capacity
with high water recovery after optimization and development of a flow-type
reactor.
