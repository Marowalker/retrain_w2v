In this article, we argue that the
primary role of isoprene is
to remove the singlet delta oxygen (O21Δg) that forms inside plants by ultraviolet excitation rather
than to provide heat protection or scavenge ozone, OH, or other reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in the gas phase. By deploying a quantum chemical
framework, we address for the first time the exact mode of isoprene
reactions with O21Δg, the
most prominent ROS that causes damage to leaves. Initial reactions
of isoprene with O21Δg comprise
its addition at the two terminal carbon atoms. The two primary open-shell
adducts that appear in these reactions undergo 1,2-cycloaddition to
generate methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein, the sole products detected
from in-house (i.e., inside of plants) oxidation of isoprene. Formation
of other products, comprising the peroxy O–O bonds, is kinetically
insignificant. Furthermore, these adducts are thermodynamically too
unstable to diffuse outside of plants. Oxidation of isoprene with
O21Δg does not produce new
ROS (such as OH or HO2), supporting the well-documented
role of isoprene as an effective ROS scavenger. Deploying a solvation
model reduces the energy requirements for the primary pathways in
the range of 10–56 kJ/mol. The present results indicate that
plants attach significant value to the in-home protection against
O21Δg by investing carbon
and energy into the formation of isoprene, in spite of the appearance
of the cytotoxic methyl vinyl ketone as one of the reaction products.
(The same chemical species also form in unrelated gas-phase reactions
involving isoprene and other ROS.) This finding explains the primary
reason for the appearance of the dynamic biosphere–atmosphere
exchange of methyl vinyl ketone.

1 Introduction
Emission
of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) from many terrestrial
plants accounts for nearly one-third of the annual global budget of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from all biogenic and anthropogenic
sources combined.1 Owing to its high chemical
reactivity, once emitted to the atmosphere, isoprene plays a crucial
role in many atmospheric phenomena.2 This
includes modifying the mechanisms of the atmospheric removal of other
VOCs, influencing the formation of secondary organic aerosol and affecting
the production of ozone. Although isoprene exerts no greenhouse gas
(GHG) effect on its own right, its fast reaction with OH radicals
can change the atmospheric oxidation capacity and the atmospheric
lifetime of methane (the third most important GHG). But this is not
the reason why plants invest their carbon and energy resources to
synthesize isoprene.

A significant debate has been sweeping
the field on reasons for
plants to produce isoprene in an operation that is both biochemically
expensive and energy dependent.3 Mounting
experimental evidence demonstrates that isoprene undergoes complex
heat-tolerant mechanisms in plants. The direct production of isoprene
from light-dependent photosynthesis indicates a plausible thermoslike
protection of leaves from certain types of heat shocks.4 However, the most discussed role of isoprene
is the mitigation of the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
plants.5 By acting as an ROS scavenger,
isoprene can prevent visible damage caused by exposure of leaves to
ozone or OH radicals and reduce the loss in their photosynthetic capacity.
Nonetheless, isoprene–ROS reactions remain to be elucidated,
especially those occurring inside plants.

The lowest excited
state of singlet delta oxygen (O21Δg) constitutes the most prominent
ROS causing damage to leaves6 in such a
way that this exotic species accounts for over 80% of lipid oxidation
within leaf tissues.7 Photo-induced activation
produces O21Δg in plants,
mainly mediated by the excited state of the triplet chlorophyll (3Chl*).8 The literature has documented
well the O21Δg scavenging
properties of isoprene.9 Isoprene acts
as an effective quenching agent for many ROS, including the O21Δg.3b Through the use of rose bengal as a photo-sensitizer, experiments9a,9b have demonstrated that isoprene protects plants against the damaging
effect of O21Δg. In fact,
ultraviolet (UV) excitation of an isoprene/ground state oxygen mixture
results in the formation of O21Δg.10 Because the biochemical synthesis
of isoprene displays light-dependency, the resistance to O21Δg correlates positively with the light
intensity.3a However, the exact mode of
isoprene attacks on O21Δg remains
largely unclear. Jardine et al.11 have
experimentally simulated a “within-plant” oxidation
process of isoprene to report methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein
as the sole oxidation products. The authors linked the formation of
these two compounds with the functionality of isoprene as an ROS scavenger
but without pointing to O21Δg, in particular.

Here, we suggest that the main role of isoprene
is to remove O21Δg that forms
inside of plants
by the photo-induced activation process. From this perspective, by
deploying quantum chemical calculations, this article provides a detailed
mechanistic account of the reactions of O21Δg with isoprene. Because of the highly transient
nature of O21Δg (lifetime
of a few microseconds),12 the reaction
chemistry of O21Δg constitutes
an excellent candidate for a purely theoretical scrutiny. The reaction
mechanism and the kinetic parameters developed herein will assist
in formulating an atomic-scale understanding of the protective functions
of isoprene in plants against ROS, particularly O21Δg.

2 Methodology
Normally,
treatment of the biradical character exhibited by the
adduct of isoprene and O21Δg would require the application of multireference wave function methods
such as CASSAF and CASSTP2.13 The pioneering
work by the Yamaguchi14 group has demonstrated
that the energies of the biradical systems computed by any single-determinant
method can be significantly improved by the application of a simple
approximate spin-projection (AP) scheme. In this scheme, an approximate
spin-projected energy (EAP) can be derived
from the energies of the broken-symmetry (EBS) and pure high-spin (EHS) states  where fAP denotes
the spin-projection factor,  and ⟨S2⟩HS and ⟨S2⟩BS signify the expectation values of spin
contamination pertinent
to the pure high-spin and broken-symmetry states, respectively. Application
of the AP methodology to various biradical systems yields B3LYP-derived
energies to within 4.2–12.6 kJ/mol of the corresponding values
obtained with more expensive multireference methods.15 In a series of contributions,16 Cremer and co-workers showed that unrestricted density functional
theory (UDFT) methods perform surprisingly well in deriving energies
and geometries of singlet biradicals.

Accordingly, we deploy
the density functional theory (DFT) functional
of B3LYP with the extended 6-311+G(d,p)17 basis set to investigate the biradical system of isoprene and O21Δg. Final energies are corrected
using the AP approach as described above, whenever the reacting species
(including reactants, products, and transition states) attain a biradical
character. As an initial accuracy benchmark, we calculate the triplet–singlet
delta enthalpic gap of the oxygen molecule to be 85.4 kJ/mol, in a
relatively good agreement with the corresponding experimental value
at 94.1 kJ/mol.12 Standard UB3LYP calculations
result in a significantly larger enthalpy gap of 161.5 kJ/mol, demonstrating
the necessity of applying the AP approach. Table S1 enlists the calculated thermal enthalpies and the expected
spin contamination values, that is, values required in calculations
based on the AP methodology. We carry out all structural optimizations
and energy calculations using the Gaussian 09 suite of programs.18 We have carefully confirmed the identity of
each transition structure by performing intrinsic reaction coordinate
(IRC) calculations.

The ChemRate code facilitates the calculation
of the reaction rate
constants, in the temperature range of 300–600 K.19 We obtain the Fukui20 indices for electrophilic attack (f-1) and the electronic Hirshfeld21 charges
with the aid of DMol3 code.22 The Fukui f–1 indices serve as
a molecular descriptor, reflecting the tendency of a certain site
in a chemical species to undergo an electrophilic addition.

3 Results and Discussion
The structure of isoprene features
a conjugated π system,
where the digits 1 and 2 denote two sites for the addition of O21Δg (Figure 1). Figure 2 depicts the mechanism of the reactions of isoprene
with O21Δg, with the geometries
of intermediates and transition structures portrayed separately in Figures S1 and S2. The electrophilic properties
of O21Δg enable the introduction
of oxygen atoms into olefins, dienes, and aromatic structures through
three main categories of reactions: 1,2-cycloaddition to double bonds,
1,4-cycloaddition to aromatic rings, and the so-called concerted ene
reaction. Generally,23 the nonconcerted
mechanism underlying the reactions of typical dienes with the O21Δg passes through diradical
intermediates. For instance, the diradical peroxy adduct has been
previously observed in the case of cis-1,3-butadiene.13b Similarly, in this study, the simulations led
to two diradical intermediates (M1 and M14).

The values in bold and italics signify reaction and activation enthalpies
computed at 298.15 K, respectively (in kJ/mol).

All attempts to locate the transition structures preceding
1,2-/1,4-cyloadditions
or a direct abstraction of a methyl hydrogen atom (i.e., an ene reaction)
converge to the peroxy adducts M1 and M14, in
which the oxygen molecule binds to the terminal carbon atoms at sites
1 and 14, respectively. If it operates in our system, ene reaction
should result in the formation of an allylic hydroperoxide upon a
shift in the position of the most electron-rich double bond (i.e.,
species M3 in Figure 2). If the occurrence of an ene is a feasible opening
channel, this would violate the role of isoprene as an ROS scavenger
because it results in the generation of another potent ROS species,
namely the OH radical, through dissociation of the weak O–OH
bond.

Although peroxirane and zwitterionic intermediates were
detected
on the potential energy surface in the reaction between butadiene
and O21Δg,24 despite our best efforts, we were unable to locate these
intermediates. Nonetheless, conversion of the initially formed diradical
peroxy-type adduct into peroxirane was shown to be a highly endothermic
process by about 100 kJ/mol. Analogously, a related study25 predicted that a zwitterionic adduct resides
nearly 40 kJ/mol above the initially formed diradical intermediates.

Rotation of the peroxy O–O bond in M1 and M14 adducts could potentially generate syn and anti conformers. However, performing a partial optimization
along the corresponding dihedral angles leads to structures in which
the outer oxygen atom either abstracts a hydrogen atom or adds to
the carbon skeleton (one of the products in Figure 2); viz., stable syn and anti conformers do not arise in M1 and M14.

The M1 and M14 moieties, in
addition to their
transition structures TS1 and TS12, possess
an open-shell character. On the basis of AP-corrected enthalpies (298.15
K), the reaction barrier of TS12 (99 kJ/mol) overshoots
that of TS1 by 51 kJ/mol. To elucidate the different reactivities
for the addition of O21Δg at
sites 1 and 2, Figure 3 displays the calculated Fukui indices and electronic charges on
isoprene. The higher electron densities and f–1 values at site 2 in comparison with the analogous
estimates at site 1 concur with the lower activation barrier of TS1 with reference to TS12.

Figure 3 Fukui f–1 indices
(in bold) and Hirshfeld charges (in brackets).

The two initial adducts, M1 and M14, reside
at a similar level above the entrance channel. As Figure 2 depicts, the initial adduct
M1 branches into seven exit routes, whereas M14 launches six channels. In the main channel, a 1,2-cycloaddition
occurs via TS7 overcoming a modest enthalpic barrier of
46 kJ/mol and forms the M7 adduct. A very exothermic C–C
bond fission (−376 kJ/mol) in M7 provides the experimental
product for in-house oxidation of isoprene, the methyl vinyl ketone
molecule. This process takes place through a barrier of 92 kJ/mol
embedded in TS8.

The transition states TS2, TS4, and TS6 from the main channel, along
with TS13 and TS14 signify H-migration reactions,
in which the outer oxygen
atom abstracts a hydrogen atom from the neighboring carbon atoms through
sizable reaction barriers amounting to 151, 166, 80, 86, and 143 kJ/mol,
respectively. Fission of the relatively weak O–OH bond in the
structure of hydroperoxide intermediates (such as M5 and
M16) requires modest bond dissociation enthalpies in the
range of 141–147 kJ/mol. Nonetheless, significantly higher
barriers for the formation of allylic hydroperoxide (80–166
kJ/mol) with reference to the barrier of the main route (46 kJ/mol)
indicate that the formation of the propagating OH radical from the
unimolecular rearrangement of M1 is highly unlikely. All
our attempts to find transition states connecting M1 directly
with M3 and M5 have led to TS2 and
TS4, respectively. This interpretation has been guided
by detailed IRC calculations and vibration analysis. The formation
of hydroperoxide M6 from M1, as well as M15 from M14, occurs via H abstraction from the CH2 site by the terminal oxygen atom of the peroxy group, with
modest reaction barriers of 80 kJ/mol (TS7) and 86 kJ/mol
(TS14), respectively.

Transition structures TS9 (137 kJ/mol) and TS10 (67 kJ/mol) engender 1,3-
and 1,4-cycloadditions commencing from M1. Formation of
the six-membered ring, M11 structure, from M1 and M14 proceeds via similar reaction barriers through
TS10 and TS18. The peroxy O–O bonds in
the molecules are typically very weak, that is, 150 kJ/mol.26 This explains the absence of M10,
M11, and M19 from the products of isoprene oxidations
initiated by O21Δg.

Both M1 and M14 are capable of forming short-lived
dioxirane species M13 and M21 via a two-step
pathway, initiated by 1,2-hydrogen transfer characterized by the TS11 (115 kJ/mol) and TS19 (117 kJ/mol) transition
states. The corresponding biradical intermediates of M12 and M20 then pass through a barrierless unimolecular
cyclization to form the highly stable heterocyclic peroxides M13 and M21. Because the reaction barriers associated
with TS11 and TS19 significantly overshoot the
barriers of the primary channels (TS7 and TS15), synthesis of dioxiranes from the reaction of isoprene with O21Δg is largely negligible.

On the basis of the reaction and activation barriers displayed
in Figure 2, the channel
associated with the attack of O21Δg molecule on the double bond at site 2 produces methyl vinyl
ketone predominantly. Likewise, addition of oxygen at site 1 preferentially
forms the second experimentally detected product of methacrolein.
The kinetic parameters listed in Table 1 reveal that the overall isoprene + O21Δg reaction proceeds mainly by the addition
of O21Δg at site 2 (M1) and forms methyl vinyl ketone molecule in a three-step mechanism
(M1 → M7 → M8 + M9). All other channels display negligible importance, including
isomerization of M1 into the six-membered cyclic peroxide
M11.

To investigate the solvent effect on the reaction
energetics for
the two main pathways (i.e., formation of M8 and M18 from M1 and M14, respectively), we
deploy a polarizable continuum model (PCM)27 at the B3LYP/6-311g+(d,p) level of theory. Figure 4 contrasts the energies obtained in the gaseous
and aqueous media. The PCM approach simulates the solvent effect by
generating multiple overlapping spheres inside of a dielectric continuum,
around the atoms within the molecule. The PCM predicts a systematic
energy reduction in the range of 10 kJ/mol (TS1) to 56
kJ/mol (TS12) for transition states, intermediates, and
final products along the two primary channels. Overall, the effect
of the solvent is limited to reducing the energy penalties whereas
the product distribution (i.e., based on kinetic values in Table 1) remains unchanged
with reference to the gas-phase system.

Methyl vinyl ketone also
constitutes a major product from the OH-initiated
atmospheric oxidation of isoprene.28 However,
in accordance with the experimental finding of Jardine et al.,11 we have shown that methyl vinyl ketone also
appears from a within-plant oxidation of isoprene with O21Δg. As Jardine et al.11 have indicated, this calls for a reconsideration of the
biogenic life cycle of isoprene and its oxidation products. Clearly,
plants devote a significant effort into their protection against O21Δg by producing isoprene in
a diurnal cycle29 that reflects the formation
of O21Δg, in spite of the
appearance of the cytotoxic methyl vinyl ketone as the reaction product.
