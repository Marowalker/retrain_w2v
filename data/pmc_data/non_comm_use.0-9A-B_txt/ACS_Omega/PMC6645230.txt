With
the retention of many of the unrivaled properties of bulk
diamond but in thin-film form, nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) has applications
ranging from micro-/nano-electromechanical systems to tribological
coatings. However, with Young’s modulus, transparency, and
thermal conductivity of films all dependent on the grain size and
nondiamond content, compositional and structural analysis of the initial
stages of diamond growth is required to optimize growth. Spectroscopic
ellipsometry (SE) has therefore been applied to the characterization
of 25–75 nm thick NCD samples atop nanodiamond-seeded silicon
with a clear distinction between the nucleation and bulk growth regimes
discernable. The resulting presence of an interfacial carbide and
peak in nondiamond carbon content upon coalescence is correlated with
Raman spectroscopy, whereas the surface roughness and microstructure
are in accordance with values provided by atomic force microscopy.
As such, SE is demonstrated to be a powerful technique for the characterization
of the initial stages of growth and hence the optimization of seeding
and nucleation within films to yield high-quality NCD.

1 Introduction
Through the advent of
nanocrystalline diamond (NCD), many of the
superlative properties of diamond are available in a large-area, heteroepitaxial
thin-film form at a fraction of the cost of bulk diamond.1 As such, NCD has been touted for use in applications
typically unsuited to bulk diamond, such as micro- and nano-electromechanical
systems (MEMS/NEMS),2 tribology,3 and thermal management coatings.4 However, the quality of NCD films is heavily dependent
on the nucleation density, and hence seeding, and the initial stages
of growth.4

The large free surface
energy of diamond relative to the substrate
(6 vs 1.5 J m–2 for the (100) face of silicon) and
the low sticking coefficient of methyl precursors ensure that attempts
at heteroepitaxial growth typically follow the Volmer–Weber
(VW) mechanism.5 Surface diffusion will
then ensure that any impinging adatoms preferentially bond to existing
nuclei, resulting in the formation of three-dimensional isolated islands
capable of growing both laterally and vertically.5,6 With
the densities of these islands typically 104–105 on bare silicon, pretreatment with diamond particles or alteration
of the substrate surface is therefore required to increase the nucleation
density as required to realize coalesced thin films (1011 cm–2).1 When growing
atop silicon, any native oxide not covered by diamond growth will
be etched by the predominantly hydrogen plasma, allowing the formation
of an amorphous/β-SiC layer from carbon (CH4)-derived
radicals or reaction with the diamond seeds.7−10 The thickness of this layer is
then kinetically limited by silicon diffusion through the existing
carbide, with studies of bias-enhanced nucleation (BEN)-produced samples
placing an upper limit on the thickness of 9 nm.11 After sufficient lateral growth, the diamond islands will
then coalesce to form columnar crystals in accordance with the van
der Drift growth model, trapping a variety of dangling bonds and hydrogenated
sp3, sp2, and sp1 hybridized impurities
within the grain boundaries between individual crystallites.12,13 Finally, as growth continues, the differing growth rates as a result
of the anisotropy in surface diffusivities of the diamond facets will
result in the overgrowth of slower-growing crystallite facets and
a roughness that evolves with film thickness.6 With Young’s modulus,14 transparency,15 and thermal conductivity16 all correlated to the sp2 fraction and grain
size within the film, and surface roughness shown to have a detrimental
effect on NEMS performance,17,18 characterization and
subsequent optimization of the initial stages of NCD film growth are
therefore paramount.

While Raman spectroscopy is commonly used
for characterization
of diamond films, the relative strengths of the spectral features
are sensitive to the distribution of nondiamond carbon19 and unaltered by changes in the void content.
Techniques utilizing electrons, such as Auger electron spectroscopy,
reflection high-energy electron diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), are limited in their sensitivity to different
carbon environments,20 while the short
mean free path of the probing electrons prevents all but characterization
of the surface. Through measuring the change in the polarization state
of light reflected off a sample, the technique of spectroscopic ellipsometry
(SE) is thus able to nondestructively probe the variation in optical
properties with depth of thin films. Comparing the measured spectra
to those of a modeled sample structure and minimizing the difference
between the two then allows determination of the microstructure and
composition of the sample. Having previously demonstrated nearly equal
sensitivity to diamond, sp2, and void fractions for polycrystalline
diamond samples as thin as 4 nm,21 SE is
thus a powerful tool for the characterization of the initial stages
of diamond film growth.

Previous attempts at SE characterization
of bulk nanocrystalline
and microcrystalline diamond films have predominantly focused on the
use of a Bruggeman effective medium approximation (EMA) to mix reference
optical indices of the expected constituents and represent the film
by a single homogenous medium,22−25 successfully showing incremental improvements in
fit upon the addition of components to represent grain boundary sp2 carbon and void content between the nuclei, and surface roughness.19,20,26−28 Although “seed”
layers of 15–41 nm adjacent to the substrate rich in sp2, void, and occasionally SiC content have been observed with
such an approach,20,24,25 parameter correlation with the impurity fractions within the bulk
prevents determination of the microstructure of this layer with any
confidence.26 More comprehensively, in
situ characterization of the initial stages of diamond growth atop
diamond grit-abraded silicon substrates modeled the transition from
isolated islands to coalesced film.21,29−31 During these studies, the authors noted an initial parabolic reduction
in the void content, indicative of lateral VW-type growth, followed
by coalescence and a sharp peak in the sp2 fraction indicative
of the trapping of nondiamond material within the grain boundaries,21,29 accentuated by the large surface/volume ratio of crystallites. However,
as a result of the significant damage imparted after mechanical abrasion
with diamond grit, a rough amorphous silicon layer with a conformal
oxide best modeled the high defect density surface.29 With the surface undergoing recrystallization upon subjecting
to growth conditions, the similarities in the optical properties between
amorphous silicon and the carbon allotropes, and the comparatively
low seeding density (1010 cm–2), the
detection of diamond and other carbon-containing species were ruled
out and the volume fractions were fixed during the initial stages
of growth.29 The aim of this work is to
therefore use SE to characterize the initial stages of growth on Si
seeded with nano diamonds, with the order of magnitude enhanced nucleation
densities and without the damage inherent to mechanical abrasion.
The trends in fitting parameters are then corroborated with Raman
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), demonstrating the applicability
of SE to the initial stages of nanocrystalline diamond film growth.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology
A typical
AFM scan of
a nanodiamond-seeded silicon wafer and a 500 nm long height profile
are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. Due to the large ζ potential difference
between the hydrogen-terminated seeds and the native oxide at pH 7,
the strong electrostatic attraction results in the complete coverage
of the Si substrate, reminiscent of the nucleation densities of the
order of 1011 cm–2 observed by Hees et
al. upon the use of similar purification and dispersion methods.32 The height profile reiterates this close packing
while showing a maximum variation of ∼2 nm, less than the 4–8
nm particle size, and suggesting that the surface and the seeding
solution are free of agglomerated particles.33 The large ∼40 nm lateral size of individual nanodiamonds
is meanwhile believed to be due to convolution of the surface topography
and the shape of the tip.34

Figure 1 (a) AFM image and (b)
500 nm line trace of seeded silicon. The
∼2 nm maximum deviation in height suggests a high seeding density
of the 4–8 nm monodispersed seeds, whereas the large ∼40
nm lateral size is attributable to the convolution of the tip shape
and topography of the sample.

AFM images of seeded wafers subjected to 4–123 min
of growth
are then shown in Figure 2a–h, whereas Figure 3 details the averaged root-mean-square (RMS) roughness
for the varying growth duration samples with the error bars representing
±0.5 of the range of values obtained across multiple scans. After
4 min of growth, a large increase in height variation appears with
the formation of clusters of crystallites ∼20 nm above the
surrounding grains along with a corresponding increase in the roughness
from 0.5 to 3.3 nm RMS. Meanwhile, little reduction in the density
of crystallites is observed, indicative of a large number of seeds
withstanding the predominantly H+ plasma, with previously
estimated etch rates of nanodiamond under a hydrogen plasma of the
order of nanometers per hour.7 As growth
proceeds, the lateral size increases, whereas the maximum height variation
changes little in accordance with the VW-type growth model. The roughness
then locally peaks at a value of 4.6 nm RMS after 8 min of growth
as a result of the islands reaching a maximum size while still remaining
isolated. As the voids between crystallites are filled upon coalescence,
the roughness subsequently relaxes to 3.7 nm RMS, before finally rising
linearly from 8.9 to 34.3 nm RMS after 40 and 123 min of growth due
to the continued overgrowth of competing crystals in accordance with
the van der Drift and Structure Zone models.35 Particle size analysis performed on the SEM images of Figure 4a–h reiterates this
increasing particle size with average diameter values increasing from
20 to 42 and 178 nm for the 4, 40, and 123 min growth duration samples,
respectively. Also visible in Figure 3 is the increase in the range of roughness values upon
longer growth periods: as the average crystallite size increases,
the number of grains within the scan area decreases and the difference
in growth rate between the different diamond facets becomes more pronounced,
increasing the range in the roughness values observed.

Figure 2 AFM images of the (a)
4 min to (h) 123 min growth duration samples.
Steady lateral growth with minor changes in the maximum displacement
occurs for the first 20 min of growth, before continued growth leads
to the significant increase in the height of protruding facets.

Figure 3 AFM-obtained roughness for the seeded silicon
and 4–123
min growth duration samples. Little change in the roughness during
the initial 6 min of growth is observed up to the local peak at 8
min of 4.6 nm RMS as a result of coalescence. The roughness then relaxes
and subsequently increases for the 13 min growth duration sample onward.

Figure 4 SEM images of the (a) 4 min to (h) 123 min growth
duration samples.
A steady increase in particle size is observable, indicating constant
lateral growth, with the clear crystallinity suggesting the samples
are free from significant amounts of non-sp3-bonded material.

2.2 Raman
Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy
was performed to characterize the forms of carbon present during the
initial stages of growth, with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm
chosen to ensure the resonance of both sp2 and sp3 sites.36 Resulting spectra of the 6–40
min growth duration samples normalized to the second-order TO peak
of silicon at 980 cm–1 and the unadjusted spectra
of the thicker 123 min growth duration sample are plotted in Figure 5a. The scattering
from the 4 min growth duration sample was deemed too weak to allow
inferences to be made on its composition. As expected for such short-duration
growth samples, the most prominent peaks are the first- and second-order
TO peaks of silicon at 520 and 980 cm–1, respectively.37 The features visible on the tail of the first-order
silicon peak are ascribed to the boron within the heavily doped (∼1019 cm–3) substrate, with doping concentrations
exceeding 1018 cm–3 previously shown
to lead to the superposition of two local modes onto the optical phonon
of diamond at 620 and 644 cm–1 for the B11 and B10 isotopes, respectively.38,39 The relatively constant intensity feature at 830 cm–1 is meanwhile attributed to amorphous SiC, with a similar broad peak
positioned between 800 and 830 cm–1 observed in
sputtered,40 pulsed laser,41 and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)42,43-produced SiC films.

Figure 5 (a) Raman spectra of the 6–123 min growth duration
samples
and (b) magnified spectra of the carbon-associated spectral features.
The relatively constant broad peak present at 830 cm–1 is attributed to the amorphous SiC, whereas an increase in the ordered
carbon and trans-polyacetylene (TPA) is visible after
13 min of growth, which subsequently decreases with growth duration.

Figure 5b shows
a magnified view of the spectra between 1050 and 1800 cm–1 normalized to the first-order diamond line at 1332 cm–1. As typical for NCD films, the diamond phonon line (Di) exhibits
peak broadening due to the reduced crystallite size and thickness
of the samples. Heavily convoluted with the diamond line is the disordered
carbon D peak at 1360 cm–1 arising from the breathing
mode of graphitic rings, whereas the G band peak due to the in-plane
stretching of pairs of sp2 sites, typically present at
1560 cm–1 upon visible excitation,44 can be seen at approximately 1500–1510 cm–1. Such a decrease in the G band position to 1450–1510 cm–1 is indicative of the introduction of disorder within
carbon sheets and the transition from nanocrystalline graphite to
amorphous carbon, with weaker bonds softening the sp2 vibrational
modes.44 Combined with the low I(D)/I(G) ratio, which has been shown to
be linearly related to the particle size due to the loss of aromatic
rings,44 it is therefore believed that
the sp2 sites within the samples are largely amorphous
in nature. Finally, the peak at 1150 cm–1 is attributable
to trans-polyacetylene (TPA) present at the grain
boundaries.45 Always accompanied by a peak
at 1450 cm–1 due to the pair representing the sum
and difference of C=C and C–H modes within the TPA chain,45 this additional peak is shrouded by the relatively
large G band peak.45

From the magnified
spectra, it then can be seen that after 13 min
of growth, an increase in the G band peak with respect to the diamond
phonon line occurs. The intensity of the G band then peaks at 20 min,
before decreasing for the longer growth duration films and reaching
a minimum after 123 min of growth. The TPA content meanwhile, believed
to lie predominantly within grain boundaries, only becomes apparent
after 13 min of growth, peaks at 20–30 min, and then decreases
for the longer growth duration samples.

While the composite
nature of the samples ensures that the spectral
features are also dependent on the distribution of sp2-bonded
carbon within the film in addition to amount,19 through using a scattering efficiency ratio of 75 to account for
the enhanced resonance of the sp2 inclusions, the diamond
and nondiamond peak areas within a series of films can be compared.46−49 Deconvolution of the 123 min growth duration spectra within the
800–2000 cm–1 range to the peaks assigned
previously yields an sp2 fraction of 13%. Deconvolution
of the 40 and 20 min growth duration samples meanwhile suggests sp2 fractions of 27 and 23%, respectively, quantitatively showing
the reduction in impurity content with increasing growth duration
past 40 min of growth. The fit process did not converge for the remaining
samples due to the weak signal emanating from the films.

2.3 X-ray Diffraction
Grazing incidence
X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) scans for the seeded silicon to 123 min
growth duration sample are plotted in Figure 6. As visible from the plot, the silicon substrate
shows broad peaks, wider than those expected from Bragg peaks and
characteristic of thermal diffuse scattering, at 2θ values of
42 and 71°. To prevent the location of these peaks from coinciding
with the expected positions of the Bragg peaks of diamond, the ⟨110⟩
direction of the substrate was placed approximately parallel to the
propagation direction of the beam. Upon drop-seeding the substrate
with the nanodiamond colloid, the (111) Bragg peak of diamond becomes
visible at 27.8°, suggesting a lattice parameter of 3.576 Å,
0.26% larger than that of bulk diamond at 3.5667 Å. Such an increase
is in accordance with previous XRD studies of diamond nanoparticles,
where strain on the surface, which constitutes a large fraction of
the atoms within the particle, leads to the shifting of the apparent
lattice parameter.50

Figure 6 XRD of Si substrate,
seeded Si, and 4–123 min growth duration
samples. After drop seeding of the substrate, the (111) Bragg peak
of diamond becomes apparent, rising in intensity and reducing in full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) upon growth.

After subjecting the seeded substrates to growth conditions,
the
(111) peak then rises in intensity while steadily increasing in 2θ
for the first 8 min of growth, suggestive of a decrease in the lattice
constant closer to that of natural diamond. In addition, the (220)
and (113) peaks of diamond appear and steadily rise in intensity.
Further growth then leads to a reduction in the FWHM of the (111)
peak, suggesting an increase in domain size, and the plateauing off
of the lattice constant before reaching a value of 3.5639 Å for
the 123 min growth duration sample, 0.07% lower than that of natural
diamond.

2.4 Spectroscopic Ellipsometry
To prevent
problems with parameter correlation occurring upon direct modeling
of the nanocrystalline diamond films and the fitting of multiple layer
thicknesses, the optical properties of the substrate and native oxide
were first determined. On top of the silicon substrate, thick enough
to prevent incoherent back-side reflection affecting the acquired
spectra, a 1.64 nm thick native oxide layer was identified with refractive
index between that of Si and bulk SiO2 due to incomplete
oxidation.51 An additional two layers were
then added to model the NCD samples, creating a stack consisting of
a Bruggeman EMA surface roughness layer of 50% void and 50% bulk;
a bulk layer composed of two oscillators matched to the optical constants
of type I and II natural diamond;52 a native
oxide layer; and finally the silicon substrate.51 While the incorporation of nitrogen in the transition from
type IIa to Ia natural diamond is known to cause a shift in the UV
absorption edge of diamond,52 use of optical
constants from a Tauc–Lorentz oscillator fitted to thicker
polished films had little effect on the trends in composition and
absolute values, permitting the use of the natural diamond as a reference
dielectric function. Column 1 of Figure 7a plots the composition of the model upon
fitting to the 13 min growth duration sample along with the mean square
error (MSE) between the measured and modeled spectra, whereas Figure 7b plots the 70°
incidence angle spectra. As a result of the thin nanocrystalline nature
of the samples and the associated inclusions however, fitting with
the model and the optical constants of natural diamond was poor with
a large MSE of 40.8 for the 13 min growth duration sample and an average
value of 78 across the entire 4–40 min growth duration sample
set, signaling a large difference between the measured and modeled
spectra.

Figure 7 (a) Evolution of models fitted to the 13 min growth duration sample
detailing composition and thickness of layers within the stack and
associated MSE, (b) model 1 fitted to the measured spectra of the
13 min growth duration sample, and (c) model 6 fitted to the measured
spectra of the 13 min growth duration sample. After the incorporation
of a g-C and void content to represent the intergranular regions and
more accurate modeling of the interface, an improvement in fit is
gained with a reduction in the MSE from 40.8 to 12.4.

Accounting for the void content arising from the
transition from
VW- to van der Drift-type growth and nondiamond carbon hybridizations
present, the optical constants of void, glassy carbon (g-C),53 or tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C)54 were then mixed with those of diamond through
the use of the Bruggeman EMA.22 Although
the addition of void content alone did little to improve the fit as
visible in column 2 of Figure 7a, upon combination with g-C, a reduction in MSE to 24.3 was
observed for the 13 min growth duration sample and 52 across the entire
sample set. The use of the optical constants of ta-C to account for
the nondiamond inclusions however was deemed unreasonable with an
indicated fraction of 68% for the 40 min growth duration film, contradicting
the crystallinity observed in the SEM images in Figure 4 and highlighting the need for validation
of SE-obtained results with non-model-dependent characterization methods.

Further reductions in MSE were attained through more accurately
modeling the interface between NCD and substrate; as discussed, XPS
studies of growth at temperatures exceeding 800 °C have indicated
the presence of a <10 nm amorphous SiC layer due to combined carburization
from CH4-derived radicals within the plasma and direct
reaction with nanodiamond particles.7,11 Meanwhile,
hydrogen plasmas have been shown to result in the etching of the native
oxide of silicon,8,55 with etch rates of SiO2 of 0.3 nm min–1 demonstrated.56 Therefore, a β-SiC layer was then placed atop the
native oxide, with the linear regression procedure indicating a layer
thickness of 5–9 nm decreasing with growth duration,57 reducing the MSE to 14.8 for the 13 min growth
duration sample, and an average of 39 for the 4–40 min growth
duration samples. Finally, upon allowing the thickness of the native
oxide to vary from the 1.64 nm obtained during modeling of the substrate,
the fitting procedure suggests a thickness of less than one, indicating
that it does not improve the fit and thus unlikely to be present within
the samples. As a result, the MSE is further reduced to 12.5 for the
individual sample and to 37 across the 4–40 min growth duration
samples.

Finally, as the samples were cooled in a purely H2-fed
plasma, it is to be expected that the surface will be free from any
adventitious carbon, reiterated by the clear homogenous faceted features
in the SEM images of Figure 4. Replacing the bulk component of the surface roughness EMA
layer with that of the optical constants of diamond then further reduces
the MSE to 12.4 for the 13 min growth duration sample, reiterated
by the closer fitting of the modeled and measured spectra in Figure 7c, and to 34 for
the 4–40 min growth duration sample set. Upon this removal
of the g-C content from the surface roughness layer, a correlated
increase in the fraction within the bulk is observed to maintain a
constant absolute content, following the behavior observed in previous
studies.21 To investigate this correlation
further, the correlation matrix of model 6 fitted to the 13 min growth
duration sample in Figure 7a is shown in Table 1, with values equal to ±1 indicating that the two parameters
achieve the same result and are not unique. Of note is the relatively
low correlation of the bulk g-C contents with the other fit parameters
suggesting that the indicated fraction is unique, whereas the surface
roughness layer thickness is highly correlated to the thickness of
the bulk and SiC layers and the void fraction within the bulk, warranting
validation with AFM.

Table 1 Fitting Parameter
Correlation Matrix
for the 13 min Growth Duration Samplea
 	S.R. thickness	bulk thickness	bulk g-C %	bulk void %	SiC thickness	
S.R. thickness	1	–0.91	0.54	–0.95	–0.94

bulk void %	0.95	0.88	–0.53	1	0.94	
SiC thickness	–0.94	0.74	0.58	0.94	1	
a With values close to ±1 signifying
that the two parameters produce the same result and are not unique,
high correlation can be observed between the S.R. thickness and the
volume fractions and thicknesses of other layers within the stack,
warranting validation with AFM.

Once settled on the optimal structure, the optical constants of
the nondiamond content and carbide layer were varied using reference
dielectric functions of ta-C, graphite, DLC produced under various
conditions, amorphous SiC,58 and α-SiC
from the Woollam database and the literature. In a similar result
to Cella et al., changing the optical constant of the nondiamond carbon
content results in a varying concentration of the said impurity within
the samples,23 whereas the trend with growth
duration remains the same. Meanwhile, minor changes are observed in
the MSE and the remaining fit parameters due to the relatively low
correlation with the g-C fraction. Previous characterization by Hong
et al. demonstrate that while the dielectric function of g-C does
not follow the shape of the sp2 inclusions within a ∼200
nm thick NCD film, particularly the presence of a fundamental band
gap of 0.77 eV, the average magnitudes are similar.29 In combination with trends observed with Raman spectroscopy,
the optical constants modeled by g-C were therefore retained. Upon
changing the optical constants of the carbide interface however, large
deviation in the surface roughness and bulk void content occurs; all
but the β-SiC optical constants demonstrate relatively consistent
roughness values for the 4–30 min growth duration films in
the range of 10–20 nm before increasing for the final 40 min
growth duration sample, contradicting the roughness values obtained
with AFM plotted in Figure 3. The use of the optical constants of β-SiC meanwhile
rejects the surface roughness layer for the 4–8 min growth
samples, which then increases linearly with growth duration, with
the point of inclusion of this surface roughness layer coinciding
with the peak in the roughness plot of Figure 3. As described earlier, such a local maximum
would be expected at the point of coalescence with the height of the
islands reaching their peak while still being isolated crystals. As
such, β-SiC was chosen to model the optical constants of the
interfacial region.

The resulting trends in the fitting parameters
with growth duration
are plotted in Figure 8. For the results reported, further depolarization was fitted manually
to account for thickness nonuniformity, leading to minor improvements
in MSE with little modification to the structural parameters reported
previously. As is visible in the plot, before growth, the spectra
of the seeds are best modeled by a 4.38 nm thick Bruggeman EMA layer
with 54.9 and 4.5% void and g-C content, respectively, sitting on
top of a 1.64 nm thick native oxide layer. Upon being subjected to
CVD, the thickness of the porous layer then increases to ∼30
nm for the first 8 min of growth, whereas the decreasing void content
to 28.8% for the 8 min growth duration sample suggests steady lateral
growth. During this time, the g-C-to-diamond ratio remains the same,
whereas the thickness of the newly formed SiC layer peaks at 8.9 nm.
After 13 min of growth, a surface roughness layer is required to accurately
model the spectra, correlating with the peak in roughness observed
with AFM and the point at which the thickness of the bulk begins to
rapidly rise from ∼30 to 79.3 nm for the 40 min growth duration
sample. Meanwhile, plotting the RMS roughness obtained through AFM
with a multiplication factor of 2/3 shows a course correlation with
the thickness of this surface roughness layer. Along with the increase
in thickness also comes an increase in the indicated g-C content,
rising to 22.7% for the 40 min growth duration sample, whereas the
void content falls parabolically before plateauing at 7.4%. Finally,
the SiC layer thickness decreases and remains relatively constant
at 5–6 nm. For the thicker and rougher 123 min growth duration
sample, the surface roughness is no longer homogenous within the wavelength
range used, resulting in the breakdown of the EMA and an overestimation
of the void content within the bulk at 22.1%, should it be allowed
to vary; therefore, the value was fixed at 7.5%. Meanwhile, the thickness
of the film prevents fitting of the buried SiC layer, which was set
to 5.03 nm as for the films of shorter growth duration. Should the
parameters be allowed to vary, the low correlation results in minor
changes to all but the bulk thickness, with values of 43.8 nm, 6.7%,
22.1%, and 12.46 nm for the surface roughness layer thickness, g-C
and void contents within the bulk, and SiC layer thickness, respectively,
validating the trends observed in the g-C content and surface roughness.

Figure 8 Fitting
parameter trends for the seeded substrate and 4–123
min growth duration samples. The point at which a second EMA is required
to model the surface roughness corresponds to the local maximum in
AFM roughness and marks the onset of the increase in bulk thickness.
Before this point of coalescence, the g-C content remains constant
before increasing to 22.7% and subsequently dropping with growth duration,
whereas the void content parabolically decreases with increasing thickness,
suggesting the occurrence of a significant fraction of the content
adjacent to the substrate.

2.5 Applicability of SE Model
As a result
of the high nucleation densities achievable and the lack of substrate
damage with the use of electrostatically attracted diamond nanoparticles,
a clear seed layer is visible with SE. Best modeled by a 4.38 nm thick
EMA composed of 54.9% and 4.5% void and g-C contents, respectively,
atop a native oxide, as shown in the schematic of Figure 9, the porous layer suggests
that the 4–8 nm particles are monodispersed.33 Upon subjecting such seeded substrates to growth, a clear
distinction can then be observed between the nucleation period and
bulk growth regime in Figure 8, not requiring composition fixing due to the visibility of
the diamond seeds. For the 4–8 min growth duration films, the
fitting procedure rejects the presence of a surface roughness layer
composed of 50% void and 50% diamond, instead being best modeled by
a single EMA composed of diamond, void, and g-C, as highlighted in Figure 9. During this time,
minor increases in sample thickness occur, whereas the void content
decreases parabolically, indicative of growth occurring faster within
the plane of the substrate rather than normal to the surface. Reiterating
this VW-type growth, the AFM images in Figure 2a–c show agglomerated islands with
the displacement in height larger than the thickness determined with
SE. Meanwhile, the average particle diameter deduced from the SEM
images indicates a 20% increase in the particle diameter from 20 to
24 nm for the 4 and 8 min growth duration samples accompanied by a
reducing FWHM of the (111) diamond Bragg peak in Figure 6. After the AFM-indicated roughness,
shown in Figure 3,
locally peaks at an SE-indicated thickness of 31 nm, a second layer
is then required to model the surface roughness, indicative of the
formation of a coalesced film. A peak in SE-deduced roughness, indicating
the requirement of a second EMA layer, has been observed during in
situ studies of the growth of nanocrystalline diamond atop microscratched
silicon and attributed to the size of the isolated crystallites reaching
a maximum before making contact and forming a coalesced film.21,29−31 Through assuming growth atop hemispherical nuclei
arranged on a square grid, a void fraction of 48% indicates coalescence
of the individual grains and the formation of a complete film.21 Modeling the initial nuclei as a surface roughness
and adding a bulk layer upon the void fraction dropping below 50%,
previous in situ studies achieved relatively constant seed layer thicknesses
of 20–40 nm for nucleation densities of the order of 1010 cm–2.29 In
the present study, however, SE estimates an initial seed layer composed
of 55% void dropping to 33% upon 4 min of growth and the formation
of aggregated less ordered nuclei. Therefore, with the high packing
density of the 4–8 nm DND seeds demonstrated by the low vertical
displacement in Figure 1b reminiscent of that demonstrated by Hees et al. and the previously
reported stability of seeds under H2 plasma conditions,
it is likely that the nucleation density is of the order of 1011 cm–2.32,7 For thicker
NCD films modeled with a seed layer to account for the inferior diamond
present at the interface with the substrate, similar thicknesses of
15–41 nm are reported.24,26

Figure 9 Schematic detailing the
growth of nanocrystalline diamond from
monodispersed nanodiamond seeds to coalesced film, along with SE-indicated
layer constituents. After subjecting to CVD conditions, the nanodiamond
seeds act as nucleation sites for Volmer–Weber-type growth,
whereas the native oxide is stripped by the predominantly atomic hydrogen
plasma and replaced with an amorphous SiC layer. Continued growth
leads to coalescence of the individual islands and the distinct requirement
of a second EMA to model the surface roughness, whereas non-sp3-bonded carbon is trapped within newly formed grain boundaries.

The fitted surface roughness EMA
thickness and the AFM RMS roughness
obtained through the averaging of 1 and 25 μm2 scans
for the 4–40 and 123 min growth duration samples, respectively,
are plotted in the second panel of Figure 8. Due to the nature of the effective medium
approximation, SE is most sensitive to roughness between the atomic
scale and a tenth of the wavelength of the probing light,27 with finite element method simulations showing
the breakdown of the approximation as the roughness increases.27,59 In comparison, AFM offers greater sensitivity to larger undulations
of the order of a micron and reduces the surface texture down to a
single parameter.27,60 Correlating the two characterization
methods, SE and AFM studies on hydrogenated amorphous Si produced
with plasma-enhanced CVD have demonstrated a relationship between
the thickness of the roughness layer deduced with SE (tSE) and the RMS roughness obtained with AFM (RRMS) of the form tSE ≈
1.5RRMS + 0.4 nm for 1 ≤ tSE < 10 nm.61 Similarly,
SE characterization of polycrystalline silicon has meanwhile observed tSE/RRMS values of
0.89–1.46 dependent on the AFM scan size, demonstrating the
effect of sample inhomogeneity when comparing AFM-obtained roughness
to the light-based technique with a spot size of the order of mm2.60 As previous SE studies on NCD
films have demonstrated a similar relationship, a factor of 1.5 was
incorporated into the SE-deduced roughness plot in Figure 8,24 with the modified trend matching the AFM-measured roughness values
well for the 13–30 min growth duration samples. After 30 min
of growth, the considerable surface roughness, exceeding λ/10,
results in nonhomogenous mixing of the constituents at scales close
to the probing wavelength and the breakdown of the EMA. This difference
is then believed to be exacerbated by the underestimation of the roughness
by AFM as the grain size approaches the 1 μm2 area
scanned for the 40 min growth duration sample.

Of particular
interest is the trend in g-C content observed upon
the formation of a coalesced film as plotted in the third panel of Figure 8. During the seed
and nucleation phase of growth, the ratio of the g-C to diamond absolute
content remains constant at approximately 0.09, before increasing
to a peak of 0.25 for the 40 min growth duration sample upon the transition
to a coalesced film and subsequently reducing to 0.1 for the 123 min
growth duration sample. With the low correlation observed in the matrix
of Table 1 between
this g-C content and the other parameters, it is unlikely that this
peculiar increase is an artifact of the fitting procedure, with such
a low correlation also being reported during in situ SE NCD studies.21 This trend is supported by the increase in the
Raman G band at 1500–1560 cm–1 with the D
band at 1360 cm–1 remaining constant after 20 min
of growth, indicative of an increase in the amorphous sp2 content within the film. The intensity of the G peak then begins
to decrease for the 30 min growth duration sample before reaching
a minimum for the 123 min growth duration sample. Meanwhile, deconvolution
of the Raman diamond peak and D and G bands of the 20, 40, and 123
min growth duration samples and accounting for the larger resonance
of sp2 sites for visible wavelengths suggest nondiamond
contents of 23, 27, and 13%, reiterating this decrease in nondiamond
content after 40 min of growth. This discrepancy in the trends of
values upon comparing Raman spectroscopy and SE is believed to be
due to the nonuniformity of the samples over the spot size of the
ellipsometer. A clear color change was visible by eye over the 1 ×
1 cm2-sized 40 min growth duration sample, which when coupled
with the sharp increase in the SE-indicated g-C content from 13.8
to 22.7% within the 26 nm thickness difference between 30 and 40 min
of growth could lead to an apparent shift in the point at which the
peak in g-C content occurs.

During NCD film growth, the competing,
randomly orientated crystals
will prevent the formation of sp3 bonds between neighboring
crystallites, allowing the formation of hydrogenated amorphous sp3, sp2, and sp1 sites.12,46 With the rise of isolated islands during the initial VW-type growth,
it is therefore to be expected that the nondiamond content will be
at a minimum due to the lack of trapping of material between coalescing
crystallites. Such a supposition is supported in the current study,
as the increased methane admixture of 3.86% for the first 3 min of
growth before reducing to 0.6% appears to have little effect on the
g-C content during the nucleation phase of growth, with the content
remaining constant between 4.5 and 6%. Should the increased methane
admixture solely be responsible for the inclusion of nondiamond carbon
within the sample, a reduction in the content would be observed for
the 4 min growth duration sample onward. Supporting this, previous
in situ SE studies have shown that upon varying the oxygen content
within the feed gas from O2/(O2 + H2) concentrations of 0–10% the sp2 content within
the nuclei remains near the detection limit of 1%, whereas the content
within the bulk linearly decreases from 15 to 2% due to the reduction
in the lifetime of sp2 sites with preferential etching
by oxygen ions.29 Upon coalescence, the
formation of grain boundaries then leads to an increase in the g-C
content, which peaks when the surface/volume ratio of the grains is
at a maximum before reducing with increasing crystallite size. Furthermore,
shadowing of crystallite facets from preferential etching by atomic
hydrogen within the plasma is expected to cause the peak to increase
further, with SEM studies demonstrating the formation of sp2 sites on the facets of micron-sized diamond particles.29 The rise in the peak assigned to grain boundary
TPA at 1150 cm–1 after 13 min of growth and the
indication of the formation of a coalesced film then support such
an argument.

Finally, previous in situ SE studies performed
during the subjection
of an unseeded silicon wafer to CVD growth conditions have revealed
the formation of a 4–7 nm thick porous SiC layer, with longer
growth durations increasing the density of the layer while leaving
the thickness unchanged.62 However, such
studies did not extend to include a variable-thickness interlayer
upon diamond growth on seeded wafers, due to the difficulty in distinguishing
such a thin layer from scratching-induced damage and recrystallization
at elevated temperatures, or near substrate diamond.19,21,63 In situ XPS studies on BEN and
mechanically scratched seeded films have shown the removal of signal
arising from silicon suboxides atop the substrate during the first
15 min and domination by a signal attributable to SiC, with overlayer
calculations placing thicknesses at 2–9 nm.9−11 The source
of such carbon can be either from CH4-derived radicals
within the plasma or through etching/direct interaction with diamond
crystallites, with XPS studies on nanodiamond-seeded silicon revealing
the formation of SiC upon subjection to either H2 or H2/CH4 plasmas.7 While
the thickness of this amorphous SiC layer is kinetically limited by
silicon diffusion through the existing carbide, for thicker interfaces,
EELS has shown spectra identical to those of single-crystal β-SiC.11 After the formation of a diffusion layer, preferential
evaporation of Si and/or etching of SiC then occur, hastened by the
transition to a hydrogen-rich plasma after the termination of bias-enhanced
seeding and the beginning of conventional growth.11,64 It is therefore believed that during the 3 min period of increased
methane admixture the growth of the SiC layer is enhanced, leading
to the peak thickness of 8.85 nm, less than the diffusion-limited
thickness of 9 nm indicated during in situ XPS.11 This layer begins to reduce in thickness after 8 min, with
the believed nonuniformity in growth of the samples allowing this
reduction to continue past 13 min when the entirety of the film sampled
by ellipsometry has coalesced. Stable thicknesses of ∼5.5 nm
are then observed for the 20–40 min growth duration samples
and fixed for the thicker 123 min sample. Raman spectroscopy tentatively
supports the presence of such a SiC layer with the constant appearance
of a broad peak at 830 cm–1 for all but the thicker
123 min growth duration sample, indicative of the presence of amorphous
SiC.

3 Conclusions
SE has been applied to
the initial stages of nanocrystalline diamond
growth atop nanodiamond-seeded silicon substrates, with the resulting
trends validated with AFM, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and XRD. Through
the use of a Bruggeman EMA and reference optical constants of diamond,
glassy-C, and void, a porous seed layer was visible atop the native
oxide. Upon growth, the transition from isolated islands to coalesced
film atop a SiC interlayer is then discernable, with the transition
coinciding with a peak in the AFM roughness and the introduction of
a Raman peak attributable to the formation of TPA within the grain
boundaries. The subsequent SE-indicated peak in nondiamond content
after coalescence is supported by Raman spectroscopy, whereas the
thickness of the newly formed surface roughness layer is observed
to correlate with AFM-derived roughness values. Thus, with its ease
of measurement and the ability to characterize the void, nondiamond,
and SiC contents present within newly formed films, SE is a powerful
method for the characterization of the early stages of nanocrystalline
diamond film growth.

4 Experimental Methods
Silicon (100) p-type wafers (2 in.) of <0.005 Ω cm resistivity
and 500 μm thickness were used as substrates throughout. To
reach the nucleation densities required to produce coalesced films,
the substrates were first immersed in a hydrogen-terminated monodispersed
nanodiamond/DI H2O colloid and placed in an ultrasonic
bath for 10 min, known to result in seeding densities >1011 cm–2.32 The seeded
substrates were then rinsed, spun dry, and placed inside an Astex
AX6500 series microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition reactor in
preparation for growth.

During CVD, a methane fraction of 3.86%
diluted in hydrogen was
used to stabilize and prevent etching of the ∼5 nm seeds for
the first 3 min, before being reduced to 0.6% for the remainder of
growth to realize high-quality NCD films. The pressure and microwave
power were meanwhile maintained at 40 Torr and 3.5 kW, respectively,
with heating of the substrate from the plasma resulting in growth
temperatures of ∼860 °C, as determined by dual-wavelength
pyrometry. After 4–123 min of growth, the samples were cooled
in a purely H2-fed plasma to prevent the formation of non-sp3-bonded carbon. The films were then diced with a diamond scribe,
and a ∼1 × 1 cm2 piece was taken from the center
of each for all subsequent characterizations.

Spectroscopic
ellipsometry was performed with a J.A. Woollam M-2000D
rotating compensator-type ellipsometer and CompleteEASE software between
the wavelength range of 1.2–6.2 eV (200–1000 nm), with
an acquisition period of 1 s, and at incidence angles of 65, 70, and
75°. The samples were then modeled within the CompleteEASE program
while iterating the sample structure to minimize the difference between
the measured and modeled spectra, as detailed in Section 2.2. To account for the significant
depolarization observed, an instrument bandwidth of 5 nm was incorporated
into the fitting procedure.

GIXRD was carried out on beamline
I07 at Diamond Light Source (Didcot,
U.K.) with a monochromatic energy of 12.5 keV. The samples were held
within a helium-flushed chamber to minimize background scatter. The
angle of incidence was set at 0.4°, and a Pilatus 100 K area
detector was used to collect the scattered intensity for an exit angle
of 0.1°, below the critical angle of diamond to reduce the penetration
depth and enhance the thin-film contribution to the scattered signal.

Raman scattering was performed using a WITec Alpha scanning near-field
optical microscope equipped with a 488 nm laser with a power of 0.5
mW at an acquisition time of 30 s. SEM images were taken using the
Inlens detector of a Raith eLine system operating at 15 kV and 10
mm working distance, with particle size analysis performed using ImageJ.
AFM was performed using a Park Systems XE-100 AFM operating in noncontact
mode and equipped with TESPA silicon tips (320 kHz resonant frequency,
42 N m–1 spring constant, and 8–12 nm tip
radius). Multiple areas of 1 and 25 μm2 were scanned
for the seeded silicon to 40 min growth duration sample and 123 min
growth duration samples, respectively, with analysis carried out through
the use of WSxM and Gwyddion SPM analysis software. During scanning
of the seeded silicon, the oscillation amplitude and tip–sample
interaction were kept as small as possible to minimize tip wear and
the associated imaging artifacts.
