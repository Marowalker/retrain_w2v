Nanoporous
aluminosilicate materials, synthesized by an evaporation-induced
self-assembly process, catalyze the direct aldol reaction of acyclic
acetals with a range of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to produce the corresponding
aldol addition products in high yield, rather than the expected Knoevenagel
elimination products. By carrying out the reaction in the presence
of either dimethoxy propane or the corresponding orthoester, it is
possible to capitalize on the ability of these aluminosilicate materials
to catalyze the corresponding acetalization reaction leading to the
development of novel telescoped, acetalization-direct aldol addition
reaction protocols.

Introduction
The ongoing interest
in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds
by the addition of activated methylene compounds to electrophilic
centers, and in particular the development of asymmetric variants,
bears testament to the flexibility and generality of this approach
as a synthetic strategy.1−3 The aldol reaction in particular
has found widespread use in the synthesis of a range of natural products
and pharmaceutical components, and its importance is reflected in
the number of new developments in this area, which have greatly extended
its scope.4,5 These innovations include organocatalytic
asymmetric variants,6 protocols employing
novel acidic and basic catalysts under heterogeneous conditions,7−9 and protocols with a reduced environmental impact.10−12 One significant limitation in the scope of the aldol reaction to
date has been in reactions employing readily enolizable 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds, such as 1,3-diketones, 1,3-ketoesters, and malonates. The
development of synthetically useful routes to access β-hydroxycarbonyl
compounds derived from these activated carbonyl compounds is of particular
interest as they have been identified as useful intermediates in natural
product synthesis.13−15 Additionally, 3-substituted-2,4-pentanedionates have
been identified as useful chelating motifs in functionalized materials
displaying novel photochemical properties.16 Typical aldol reaction conditions, employing basic conditions, generate
chelated enolate intermediates, which are unreactive, and when successful,
the β-hydroxycarbonyl products generated are prone to undergo
facile elimination reactions to produce Knovenagel products or retro–aldol
reaction to regenerate starting materials.17,18 Currently, only a comparatively small number of synthetic strategies
has addressed this limitation, exploiting multicomponent processes,
which trap the unstable β-hydroxycarbonyl intermediates to limit
the retro–aldol reaction or use very mild reaction conditions
employing very weak acids or bases.18,19 The lack of
suitable aldol protocols has led to the development of alternative
synthetic strategies to access β-hydroxycarbonyl products, such
as the oxy-Michael addition reaction of alkoxide nucleophiles under
strongly basic conditions.20

Our
interest in this area was prompted by the observation that
acyclic acetals undergo direct aldol reactions with activated methylene
compounds in the presence of strong Lewis acids at very low reaction
temperatures to give the corresponding addition products (Scheme 1).21 The reaction of carbonyl derivatives, such as acetals and
acylals, as surrogates for carbonyl compounds is a surprisingly mature
area22,23 and is a useful strategy for carbon–carbon
bond formation albeit one that has been comparatively under exploited.24−29

Scheme 1 Direct Aldol Reaction of Acetals with 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compounds
We have previously demonstrated
that our nanoporous aluminosilicate
materials are relatively ineffective in catalyzing addition reactions
to carbonyl substrates, but are highly efficient in catalyzing the
corresponding reactions with acetal substrates.30 Presumably, these reactions are proceeding through a highly
reactive oxocarbenium ion intermediate that rapidly undergoes subsequent
reaction with the nucleophilic species.31−34 If a similar reactivity pattern
was in operation with activated carbonyl compounds, the addition products
generated would be resistant to retro–aldol and so would provide
access to an effective strategy to address problematic aldol reactions.
Herein, we report the successful development of the direct aldol reactions
of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds to acyclic aromatic acetals employing
an easily accessible and recyclable heterogeneous aluminosilicate
catalyst and the subsequent development of telescoped acetalization–aldol
addition procedures.

Results and Discussion
We initially
assessed the ability of a range of our heterogeneous
silicate materials, produced using a simple evaporation-induced self-assembly
(EISA) approach,30,35−39 displaying different pore sizes and acidities (see Table S1 for catalyst properties), to catalyze
the addition of acetyl acetone (AcAc) to benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal
(BDMA). For comparative purposes, a selection of readily available
commercial aluminosilicate zeolite catalysts was also investigated.
We were highly gratified to observe that both our high- and low-aluminum
nanoporous silicate materials effectively catalyzed the direct aldol
addition reaction to give good conversions to the addition product 1a, which was independent of the catalyst pore size (Table 1, entries 1–4). 1H NMR analysis also confirmed the presence of varying quantities
of benzaldehyde, produced by hydrolysis of BDMA, in these crude reaction
mixtures.

Importantly,
and in contrast to previous literature reports employing
zeolites, acidic clays, aluminosilicates, or metal–organic
framework materials, only trace quantities of the Knovenagel product
were observed in these crude reaction mixtures.40−43 Presumably, the comparatively
mild reaction conditions and short reaction times employed, in addition
to the moderate acidity of the aluminosilicate catalysts, are sufficient
to catalyze the direct aldol addition reaction, but not acidic to
catalyze the corresponding elimination reaction. Indeed, the subsequent
addition of a stronger acidic reagent, such as Amberlyst-15, to a
crude sample of 1a under our standard reaction conditions
led to complete conversion to the expected Knovenagel elimination
product. Furthermore, 1H NMR and gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses of the crude reaction mixtures
indicated that no products derived from the addition of AcAc to acetonitrile
were produced.44,45 The highly Lewis acidic borosilicate
material (B-13-(3.54)) gave little of the desired addition product,
as did the plain silicate material (S-1) (entries 5 and 6), and starting
materials were recovered largely unchanged. The commercially available
zeolites ZSM-5-(30), zeolite Y5, and 3 Å molecular sieves also
proved to be largely ineffective, giving only limited quantities of
the addition product 1a (entries 7–9). Importantly,
repeating the reaction in the absence of the aluminosilicate catalyst
(entry 10), or with benzaldehyde in place of BDMA (entry 11), resulted
in no aldol addition products being generated, highlighting the significant
difference in reactivity of the acetal compared to the corresponding
aldehyde under aluminosilicate catalysis.

We next undertook
studies to further optimize the addition reaction
employing our high aluminum containing, large-pore aluminosilicate
material Al-13-(3.18) as catalyst (Table 2). Examination of a range of alternative
solvents generally proved detrimental to the overall reaction outcome
(entries 1–4), with only dimethyl carbonate (DMC) providing
comparable results to acetonitrile (entry 5). Interestingly, carrying
out the reaction under solvent-free reaction conditions employing
an excess of AcAc provided a high conversion to 1a with
reduced acetal hydrolysis (entry 6). We recognized that further improvements
in both selectivity and overall yield of 1a could be
achieved if the quantities of benzaldehyde, generated by the competing
hydrolysis of BDMA, could be reduced. Our strategy in this case, rather
than attempting the difficult and tedious task of ensuring strictly
anhydrous conditions, is to capitalize on the proven ability of the
aluminosilicate material to catalyze the acetalization reaction and
simply regenerate the acetal in situ.36,39,46,47 An additional benefit
of these optimization studies is that it sets the scene for subsequent
studies directed toward the development of telescoped protocols, which
further exploit the selectivity displayed by these catalysts for the
aldol addition reaction with acetal substrates over the corresponding
carbonyl substrates.

a Experimental conditions: the catalyst
(25 mg) was added to a solution of BDMA (0.5 mmol) and AcAc (0.6 mmol)
in the specified solvent (3 mL) in a sealed reaction vessel and heated
to 60 °C with vigorous stirring. Reactions under solvent-free

(TMOF) was added after 30 min and the reaction heated for an additional

f 0.5 equiv of dimethoxy
propane (DMOP)
was added after 30 min and the reaction heated for an additional 30
min.

g Reaction using recycled
catalyst.

Our initial studies
in this area proved encouraging. The addition
of trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF) significantly reduced the quantity
of benzaldehyde in the crude reaction mixture, with a subsequent increase
in the quantity of BDMA, although conversions to 1a displayed
only moderate improvements even after extended reaction times. Since
catalyst deactivation is unlikely given the successful acetalization
reaction, we reasoned that the methanol generated during hydrolysis
and acetalization reactions might be sufficient to shift the tautomeric
ratio of AcAc toward its unreactive keto form.48 To address this potential limitation, and to ensure greater
consistency and reproducibility, methanol in the crude reaction mixture
was removed on completion of the initial aldol addition reaction using
a gentle stream of nitrogen gas prior to the addition of the TMOF.
Under these modified reaction conditions, significant improvements
in the formation of 1a were achieved employing either
TMOF (entry 7) or dimethoxy propane (DMOP) (entry 8). In reactions
employing these additional quantities of TMOF, 1H NMR and
GC–MS analyses indicated that no products derived from the
addition of AcAc to TMOF were produced,49 and only trace quantities of 4-methoxy-3-penten-2-one were detected
in the crude reaction mixtures.50 In the
case of reactions employing DMOP, no aldol addition products to either
DMOP or acetone were observed. In line with our previous studies,
the nanoporous material could also be isolated from the reaction mixtures
and reused either directly or after a short recalcination step without
loss of catalytic activity (entry 9).36,37

With
the reaction conditions optimized, we examined the scope of
the reaction employing a range of acyclic aromatic acetals and 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds (Table 3).

f Product
contains ∼5% Knoevenagel

In cases where
acetal hydrolysis exceeded ∼20% in the initial
aldol reaction, an additional quantity of the corresponding orthoester
was included in the reaction protocol, although in a number of cases,
the starting acetals proved sufficiently stable to hydrolysis, and
the additional reacetalization step was deemed not to be necessary.
The aldol addition reaction proved to be tolerant of a range of acylic
aromatic acetals employing either AcAc (1a–1j), ethyl acetoacetate (2a–3b), or dimethyl malonate (3a and 3b), giving
the addition products in high yield and in short reaction times. The
addition products 3a and 3b derived from
dimethyl malonate proved to be unstable at 60 °C and in these
cases the reaction was conducted at 50 °C with a short extension
of the reaction time. In contrast to the reactions employing AcAc,
trace quantities of products derived from addition of ethyl acetoacetate
and dimethyl malonate to the orthoformate were observed in the crude
reaction mixtures.

We next studied the scope of the addition
reaction with an extended
range of acetal substrates. No significant reaction was observed with
cyclic acetals, presumably due to the increased stability of these
substrates,28 and only starting material
was obtained in the reaction of 2-phenyl-1,3-dioxane with AcAc. In
line with previous literature reports, the reaction of simple acetals
derived from alkyl acetals, such as valderaldehyde diethyl acetal,
provided only small quantities of the desired addition product on
reaction with AcAc. The reduced reactivity observed in this case is
due to the decrease in the stability of the reactive oxocarbenium
intermediate generated from the acetal starting material.17 Similarly, ketals, such as acetophenone dimethyl
acetal, were unreactive under the reaction conditions employed due
to steric limitations and gave no identifiable aldol addition products.21 Overall, this methodology provides an operationally
simple and effective method to access β-alkoxycarbonyl products
by a direct aldol approach and provides a useful alternative strategy
to existing oxa-Michael protocols.51

Finally, we addressed the possibility of developing telescoped
reaction protocols, in which the acetal substrate is generated in
situ from the corresponding aldehyde and an acetalization reagent
in the presence of the catalyst, followed by subsequent direct aldol
reaction with a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound. There has been significant
recent interest in the development of reaction sequences where multiple
synthetic transformations are achieved without the isolation and purification
of intermediates, as they offer considerable improvements in both
efficiency and the overall atom efficiency.52−54 We considered
two strategies to achieve this goal. First, a telescoped sequential
reaction protocol, in which the acetal is generated from the corresponding
aldehyde and an acetalization reagent, followed by addition of 1,3-dicarbonyl
compound once the acetalization reaction is complete (Scheme 2: sequential approach). The
second protocol involves a tandem approach, where all reagents are
present at the beginning of the reaction, and the acetal substrate
is generated in the presence of the 1,3-dicarbonyl compound (Scheme 2: tandem approach).

Scheme 2 Telescoped Reactions of Aldehydes with 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compounds
We initiated these studies
by considering a sequential process,
given our earlier successes in this area. As previously, the Al-13-(3.18)
aluminosilicate material proved to be a highly efficient catalyst
for acetal formation from a range of aldehydes in the presence of
a small excess of either orthoesters, such as TMOF and triethyl orthoformate
(TEOF), or DMOP, giving excellent conversion to the acetal either
at room temperature, or more rapidly, at elevated temperatures. After
removal of excess alcohol generated during the acetalization reaction,
the acetal underwent rapid direct aldol reaction on addition of a
range of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds under our optimized reaction conditions
to provide the addition products in yields similar to those obtained
by reactions directly from the acetal (Table 4).

c Isolated as a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers.

e Aldol addition

Finally, we investigated
the possibility of carrying out the reaction
as a one-pot, tandem process employing benzaldehyde and AcAc as a
model reaction. To avoid any possibility of consuming the orthoformate
in a competing reaction with AcAc, rather than the desired reaction
with benzaldehyde, we selected DMOP as the reagent for the acetalization
step. Under our optimized reaction conditions, the acetalization reaction
proceeded rapidly with almost complete consumption of the aldehyde
starting material within the first hour of reaction and provided significant
quantities of the aldol addition product 1a (Table 5, entry 1). Extending
reaction times led to improved conversions to 1a, however,
significant quantities of the Knoevenagel product 4 were
now observed in the 1H NMR spectra of these crude reaction
mixtures (entries 2–4). Presumably, maintaining
the thermally unstable aldol product at elevated temperatures for
prolonged periods of time is undesirable, leading to thermally promoted
elimination of methanol from the initial aldol adduct 1a.

d Initial reaction at room temperature
for 2 h followed by heating to 60 °C for 2 h.

We reasoned that reducing the overall
time spent at these elevated
temperatures would prove beneficial minimizing the undesirable elimination
reaction and leading to improvements in both selectivity and overall
yield. We therefore next considered a strategy, in which the reaction
was initially carried out at room temperature, to promote the initial
acetalization reaction before increasing the temperature to promote
the subsequent aldol addition reaction. As expected, reaction at room
temperature over 2 h led to the formation of significant amounts of
the acetal intermediate with only moderate quantities of the aldol
addition product (∼26%) observed. We were gratified to observe
that on increasing the reaction temperature to 60 °C, the conversion
to 1a improved to 62% with only trace quantities of the
competing Knoevenagel product being observed by 1H NMR
analysis of the crude reaction mixture (entry 5).

Conclusions
In summary, a novel and operationally simple direct aldol addition
reaction of 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds with acetals has been developed,
which avoids the requirement for the use of strong Lewis acid catalysts
under strictly anhydrous or inert reaction conditions. The procedure
employs a mildly acidic heterogeneous aluminosilicate catalyst, which
is readily accessible using an evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA)
process, which requires no specialist equipment or techniques, and
is fully recyclable. The protocol has been successfully applied to
a range of acylic aromatic acetals and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds providing
the aldol addition products in high yield, with little of the competing
Knoevenagel product being formed. The scope of this reaction can be
further extended to encompass the reaction of aldehydes in novel telescoped
acetalization–aldol addition processes, which capitalize on
the ability of these nanoporous aluminosilicate materials to efficiently
catalyze both the acetalization and subsequent direct aldol reactions.
This methodology provides a useful alternative strategy for existing
oxa-Michael protocols to access β-hydroxycarbonyl products employing
a direct aldol strategy under mildly acidic conditions.

Experimental
Section
General Methods
Acetyl acetone was dried and distilled
prior to use. Other commercially available reagents were used without
further purification. Acetal substrates were synthesized using literature
procedures.47,55 All reactions performed in sealed
screw-cap vials. Flash chromatography was carried out using Merck
Kieselgel 60 H silica. Analytical thin layer chromatography was carried
out using commercially available aluminum-backed plates precoated
with silica gel 60 F254 that were visualized under UV light (at 254
nm). Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded in the range 4000–600
cm–1 as neat oils or solids and are reported in
cm–1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were
recorded at 400 MHz in CDCl3 at 25 °C and are reported
in ppm; J values are recorded in Hz and multiplicities
are expressed by the usual conventions. Low-resolution mass spectra
(MS) were determined by electron impact ionization (EI). High-resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained by courtesy of the EPSRC Mass Spectrometry
Facility, Swansea University, U.K. using the specified ionization
technique. Removal of solvent refers to evaporation at reduced pressure
using a rotary evaporator followed by the removal of trace volatiles
using a vacuum pump. All catalysts were stored at 120 °C for
at least 12 h prior to use.

Catalyst Preparation
A typical preparation
for the
synthesis of the aluminosilicate AS-13-(3.18) catalyst under EISA
conditions is as follows:36,37 cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (4.0 g, 11 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of hydrochloric
acid (2.5 mL, 0.1 M), ethanol (17.5 mL), and water (22.5 mL). Tetraethyl
orthosilicate (25 mL, 112 mmol) was added, and the mixture stirred
for 10 min at 40 °C. The solution was cooled to room temperature,
and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (3.35 g, 8.95 mmol) was added in
one portion. The mixture was stirred for 20 min and then left to age
at room temperature for 24 h. The resultant orange solid was crushed
into a fine powder and calcined in air at 650 °C for 6 h to remove
the organic template to give a fine white powder.

The nanoporous
aluminosilicate catalyst (25 mg) was added to a solution of the desired
acetal (0.5 mmol) in the requisite dicarbonyl compound (5 equiv, 2.5
mmol) in a screw-cap vial, and the mixture heated to 60 °C with
vigorous stirring. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was cooled to
room temperature and the volatile components removed under a gentle
stream of nitrogen for 1 min. Where necessary, the corresponding orthoformate
or acetal (0.5 equiv, 0.25 mmol) was then added, and heating continued
for an additional 30 min. On completion of the reaction, the catalyst
was removed by filtration and washed with chloroform (2 × 2 mL)
to provide the crude aldol product, which was purified by column chromatography
(hexane → hexane/diethyl ether 80:20).
