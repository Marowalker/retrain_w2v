Phospholipid nanoshells, for example,
liposomes, provide a versatile
enabling platform for the development of nanometer-sized biosensors
and molecular delivery systems. Utilization of phospholipid nanoshells
is limited by the inherent instability in complex biological environments,
where the phospholipid nanoshell may disassemble and degrade, thus
releasing the contents and destroying sensor function. Polymer scaffold
stabilization (PSS), wherein the phospholipid nanoshells are prepared
by partitioning reactive monomers into the lipid bilayer lamella followed
by radical polymerization, has emerged to increase phospholipid nanoshell
stability. In this work, we investigated the effects of three different
radical initiator conditions to fabricate stable PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells yet retain the activity of encapsulated model fluorescent
sensor proteins. To identify nondestructive initiation conditions,
UV photoinitiation, neutral redox initiation, and thermal initiation
were investigated as a function of PSS-phospholipid nanoshell stabilization
and fluorescence emission intensity of enhanced green fluorescent
protein (eGFP) and tandem dimer Tomato (td-Tomato). All three initiator
approaches yielded comparably stable PSS-phospholipid nanoshells,
although slight variations in PSS-phospholipid nanoshell size were
observed, ranging from ca. 140 nm for unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells
to 300–500 nm for PSS-phospholipid nanoshells. Fluorescence
emission intensity of encapsulated eGFP was completely attenuated
under thermal initiation (0% vs control), moderately attenuated under
UV photoinitiation (40 ± 4% vs control), and unaffected by neutral
redox initiation (97 ± 3% vs control). Fluorescence emission
intensity of encapsulated td-Tomato was significantly attenuated under
thermal initiation (13 ± 3% vs control), moderately attenuated
UV photoinitiation (64 ± 5% vs control), and unaffected by neutral
redox initiation (98% ± 4% vs control). Therefore, the neutral
redox initiation method provides a significant advancement toward
the preparation of protein-functionalized PSS-phospholipid nanoshells.
These results should help to guide future applications and designs
of biosensor platforms using PSS-phospholipid nanoshells and other
polymer systems employing protein transducers.

Introduction
Biofunctionalized nanoarchitectures
are increasingly utilized in
biomedical applications,1−6 nanotechnology,7,8 biosensor development,9−12 and drug delivery.4,13−15 Self-assembled
nanoarchitectures with a wide range of geometries, including liposomes,
polymersomes, micelles, emulsions, and biofunctionalized metal nanoparticles,
have been developed using phospholipids, polymers, and/or inorganic
or hybrid materials.4,6 Among these promising nanoarchitectures,
phospholipid nanoshells (liposomes) are attractive for intracellular
sensing and drug delivery platforms because of the biocompatible nature
of phospholipids and the ability to solubilize both hydrophilic and
hydrophobic cargo, broadening their potential utility. Hydrophilic
compounds are easily loaded into the aqueous lumen of the nanoshell,
whereas the nanoshell bilayer serves as a natural carrier for hydrophobic
materials. Phospholipid nanoshells can also be functionalized with
specific targeting ligands or with integral membrane proteins.15−19 The structural, morphological, and chemical similarities of phospholipid
nanoshells with cell membranes enable encapsulation of various cargoes,
including proteins, enzymes, and DNA molecules.16,20−24 Furthermore, the aqueous interior of the phospholipid nanoshell
minimizes diffusional restrictions, which are sometimes encountered
in solid and gel polymer nanoarchitectures, and enables the fabrication
of bioinspired nanosensors and nanoreactors.25,26

The application of phospholipid nanoshells in the fabrication
of
intracellular nanosensors and nanoreactors requires the ability to
sufficiently stabilize the nanoshells while retaining activity of
the encapsulated components. However, most phospholipid nanoshells
exhibit limited stability that hinders their use in cellular applications
because of degradation and/or membrane fusion. Several approaches
have been developed to enhance the stability of phospholipid nanoshells,22,27−33 including (but not limited to) the use of polymerizable lipids,28,30 polymerization of small hydrophobic monomers in the nanoshell bilayer,22,31 and surface grafting of water-soluble polymers.32 Polymerizable phospholipids are difficult to synthesize,
and limited functionalities are available. Phospholipid nanoshells
formed using polymerizable phospholipids may also exhibit significant
leakage because of their packing behavior, which is problematic for
long-term encapsulation of cargo.34−36 Alternatively, polymer
scaffold-stabilized (PSS) phospholipid nanoshells can be fabricated
using a range of readily available functionalized lipids. PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells are formed via partitioning and subsequent polymerization
of hydrophobic reactive monomers into the hydrophobic phospholipid
bilayer lamella.22,31,37,38 This approach eliminates the requirement
of polymerizable lipid synthesis, reduces the leakage of encapsulated
molecules,10 and provides a promising route
to increase the diversity and applicability of stabilized phospholipid
nanoshells, particularly for biosensor platforms. On the basis of
these properties, PSS-phospholipid nanoshells provide an attractive
platform for development of nanosensors that can function in complex,
harsh, and/or intracellular environments.

PSS-phospholipid nanoshell
sensor platforms rely on the encapsulation
of selective and sensitive reporter chemistries, including small molecules,
enzymes, and fluorescent proteins. Previous investigations of stabilized
nanoshells showed enhanced stability of encapsulated nucleic acids
and small molecules.10,11 Fluorescent protein biosensors
have evolved as analytical tools for measurement and/or visualization
of specific analytes in vitro and in vivo.39−41 Two primary categories of fluorescent proteins with unique structural
features have emerged for biological sensing and visualization, namely,
DsRed, originally from marine corals, and green fluorescent protein
(GFP), from jellyfish, each of which has been engineered into multiple
variants that are useful across the entire visible spectrum and is
sensitive to different environmental conditions.42−45 Encapsulation of fluorescent
binding proteins into PSS-phospholipid nanoshells likely protects
the proteins from nonspecific interferences and proteolytic degradation,
thus enhancing sensor lifetime in complex chemical and biochemical
environments. However, fabrication of the stabilizing polymer scaffold
that promotes these benefits is most commonly performed using free-radical
polymerization, primarily with UV photoinitiators or thermal initiators.
The harsh chemical environments that result from high-intensity UV
exposure and elevated temperature, as well as the high radical concentration,
likely damage the function of encapsulated reporter chemistries, particularly
those that are based on fluorescent proteins. Therefore, it is necessary
to optimize the polymerization conditions to retain the maximal function
of encapsulated components.

This work describes a comparative
study of fluorescent protein
stabilities under different polymer initiation methods with the goal
of identifying a series of polymerization conditions that lead to
enhanced retention of activity. Two model proteins were utilized,
enhanced GFP (eGFP) and tandem dimer Tomato (td-Tomato), GFP and Ds-Red
homologs, which are broadly representative of fluorescent proteins
used to prepare fluorescent sensors.

Results and Discussion
The preparation of PSS-phospholipid nanoshell sensors and delivery
architectures requires that the nanoshell is sufficiently stabilized
to remain intact in harsh environments (UV exposure or elevated temperature)
and thus retains the intended cargo. In general, radical polymerization
is utilized for stabilization of PSS-phospholipid architectures, yet
the conditions typically employed to generate the required radicals
are likely to exert deleterious effects on encapsulated cargo function.
In this work, we investigated a series of radical initiation conditions
to identify a range of conditions that are compatible with retention
of cargo function. Using different polymerization conditions to prepare
PSS-phospholipid nanoshells, we sought to identify the optimal balance
of phospholipid nanoshell stability and cargo function. PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells and unstabilized controls were prepared using well-established
freeze–thaw–extrusion methods with the common phospholipid
DOPC (1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine).46 Following preparation, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA)
and n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) monomers were partitioned
into the bilayer of the nanoshells10,22 and subsequently
polymerized (Scheme 1) using three different initiation methods (Irgacure 907; 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)
dihydrochloride, AAPD; and (NH4)2S2O8/NaHSO3).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of Polymer
Scaffold Formation in Phospholipid
Nanoshells
Characterization of Phospholipid
Nanoshell Morphology and Stabilization
To determine the effects
of polymerization on phospholipid nanoshell
morphology, the size of the unilamellar phospholipid nanoshells was
monitored before and after the formation of polymer scaffolds by dynamic
light scattering (DLS).47 A significant
change was observed in the size distribution profiles of phospholipid
nanoshells after the formation of polymer scaffolds within the nanoshell
bilayers (Figure S-1, Supporting Information). The formation of polymer scaffolds and the arrangement inside
the bilayer lamella enhance the nanoshell rigidity.48 Interestingly, a larger increase in the size of phospholipid
nanoshells was observed with neutral redox initiator- and thermal
initiator-induced polymerization compared to photoinitiator-induced
polymerization. The average diameter of unstabilized phospholipid
nanoshells was ∼143 ± 3 nm [polydispersity index (PDI)
= 0.11], whereas the average diameter of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
was ∼300 ± 15 nm (PDI = 0.25), ∼480 ± 11 nm
(PDI = 0.20), and ∼340 ± 12 nm (PDI = 0.15) for photoinitiator-,
neutral redox initiator-, and thermal initiator-induced polymerization,
respectively. In the presence of the respective initiator, the monomer
and cross-linker reacted to form polymer scaffolds inside the phospholipid
nanoshell bilayer. The thermal initiator and neutral redox initiator
couple is water-soluble, whereas the photoinitiator is not.

Previous reports of polymerized phospholipid nanoshells showed that
hydrophilic initiators more effectively polymerize functionalities
at the water–bilayer interface, whereas the hydrophobic initiators
favor polymerization in the bilayer lamella.49 Additionally, the size of polymerized phospholipid nanoshells prepared
using polymeric lipids slightly increased after polymerization using
hydrophobic photoinitiators.5 Several other
investigations have noted similar results.3,27−29,47,49 In each of these cases, the monomer was embedded within the lipid
molecule; thus, there were minimal changes in nanoshell size. Conversely,
we observed increased nanoshell size when water-soluble initiators
were used for PSS-phospholipid nanoshell stabilization compared to
the minimal size changes when hydrophobic initiators were used. These
data support an enhanced polymerization at the water–bilayer
interface with hydrophilic initiators, which may lead to polymer protrusion
from the PSS-phospholipid nanoshell and enhanced interactions, or
possibly even cross-polymerization, between adjacent PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells that result in the measurement of small aggregates that
influence the size distribution. When UV photoinitiators are utilized,
the polymer is contained to the nanoshell lamella, thus better indicating
the size of individual nanoshells.

The morphology of the PSS-phospholipid
nanoshell was further investigated
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Negative staining TEM images
(Figure S-2, Supporting Information) clearly
indicate that PSS-phospholipid nanoshells are stable and almost spherical,
irrespective of initiators. TEM images also indicate that the sizes
of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells under neutral redox initiator- and
thermal initiator-induced polymerization are comparably larger than
that of photoinitiator-induced polymerization, correlating with DLS
studies.

Unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells tend to fuse in
a membrane-rich
environment, which increases the possibility of degradation of the
nanoshell architecture.50 Hence, it is
necessary to compare the stability of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
with that of unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells with a goal of optimizing
the stability of the PSS-phospholipid nanoshell. To evaluate the stability
of these nanoshells, the optical density of the phospholipid nanoshell
solution was monitored in response to surfactant (TX-100) solubilization
because surfactant molecules induce degradation of bilayer assemblies.
The optical density, resulting from the scattering of nanoshell aggregates,
of the phospholipid nanoshell solution was monitored at 630 nm, where
phospholipid, monomers, or initiators do not absorb. Figure 1 shows the optical density
of the phospholipid nanoshell solution at [TX-100]/[DOPC] = 0 (red)
and [TX-100]/[DOPC] = 10 (green). The optical density of unstabilized
phospholipid nanoshells approaches zero when [TX-100]/[DOPC] is ∼10,
supporting the hypothesis that surfactants can induce degradation
of bilayer assemblies into small fragments that ultimately dissolved
to form mixed micelles. Under all polymerization conditions, the optical
density of the PSS-phospholipid nanoshell solution is higher than
that of unstabilized nanoshells because of higher scattering efficiency
of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells. The addition of excess TX-100 ([TX-100]/[DOPC]
ratio = 10) to PSS-phospholipid nanoshell solution results in a decrease,
although to a nonzero value, because of the extraction of some phospholipid
molecules from the polymer scaffolds by TX-100. These data support
the hypothesis that formation of polymer scaffolds inside the phospholipid
nanoshell bilayer leads to the stabilization, which hinders surfactant
solubilization of the phospholipid nanoshells.

Figure 1 Variation in the optical
density of unstabilized and PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells at mole ratios of [TX-100]/[DOPC] = 0 (red) and [TX-100]/[DOPC]
= 10 (green) in PBS buffer: (a) phospholipid nanoshells, (b) photoinitiator-induced
PSS-phospholipid nanoshells, (c) redox initiator-induced PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells, and (d) thermal initiator-induced PSS-phospholipid nanoshells.
The concentration of DOPC and TX-100 in solution was 0.8 and 8.0 mM,
respectively.

To further correlate
the stability of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
in comparison with unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells, we also monitored
the nanoshell size in the absence and presence of TX-100. Unstabilized
DOPC nanoshells solubilize completely upon treatment of TX-100. The
TX-100 dissolves unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells to form mixed
micelles with an average diameter of ∼10 nm (Figure S-1, Supporting Information) at [TX-100]/[DOPC] = 10.
In contrast, upon treatment of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells with excess
TX-100 at [TX-100]/[DOPC] = 10, an intense peak at higher diameters
(∼100 to 1000 nm) was observed. The variation in optical density
and size of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells is likely due to the extraction
of the lipid molecules from polymer scaffolds. The removal of a few
phospholipids from polymer scaffolds in the presence of TX-100 may
lead to aggregation of nanoshells containing hydrophobic polymer scaffolds,
which is reflected in the DLS peak at a higher diameter range. Mixed
micelles containing TX-100–DOPC were likely also present in
solution, but the scattering intensity was markedly lower than that
from the aggregated polymer scaffolds and thus was not detected by
the DLS instrument. It should be noted that treatment of PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells with excess TX-100 ([TX-100]/[DOPC] = 10) is an extremely
harsh condition, which would not be encountered under typical utilization
conditions. Therefore, the formation of polymer scaffolds should provide
sufficient stability to phospholipid nanoshells in the intracellular
and other complex biological environments.

To confirm the formation
of polymer scaffolds under each initiation
condition in PSS-phospholipid nanoshells, we isolated the polymer
scaffolds by washing the PSS-phospholipid nanoshells with methanol
and water. SEM images of isolated polymer scaffolds are shown in Figure S-3 (Supporting Information). The images
support aggregation of the polymer scaffolds after removal of phospholipids.
Interestingly, photoinitiator-induced polymer scaffolds appeared to
aggregate less than neutral redox initiator- and thermal initiator-induced
polymer scaffolds.

Understanding the formation of polymer scaffolds
and their influence
on the phospholipid bilayer is crucial to understanding the effective
stability of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells. Because PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells formed under all three initiator conditions are stable
in chemically harsh environments, these conditions may be used as
a platform to design biosensors. However, the development of biosensors
requires functional integration of sensing components, including proteins
or enzymes, as well as nondestructive approaches to stabilize the
sensor architecture that are compatible with sensor function.

Evaluation
of Polymerization Conditions on Model Sensor Protein
Activity
To utilize PSS-phospholipid nanoshells that encapsulate
sensor proteins as platforms for biosensor development, the stability
of the encapsulated proteins must be retained under polymerization
conditions. The formation of polymer scaffolds in bilayers using an
initiator requires the generation of excess free radicals as well
as elevated temperature or UV irradiation. To evaluate the protein
activity, eGFP and td-Tomato, fluorescent proteins that serve as model
proteins for sensor design, were individually encapsulated in the
aqueous core of phospholipid nanoshells using freeze–thaw–vortex–extrusion
methods.5 In GFPs, the chromophore is surrounded
by α helices and β sheets with an extensive hydrogen bonding
network, which prevents the attack of water molecules that would quench
fluorescence.51 The proper tertiary structure
of eGFP is essential to exhibit fluorescence. The stability of fluorescent
proteins is also sensitive to the surrounding environment and various
factors, including salt concentrations, pH, and temperature.52−57 The radical polymerization conditions typically used produce free
radicals in solution, as well as high doses of UV, high salt concentrations,
or elevated temperatures, all of which may influence the structure
and stability of eGFP and td-Tomato encapsulated in phospholipid nanoshells.
Thus, variations in fluorescence intensity can be used as an indicator
of protein stability, as it is directly related to fluorescence output.58,59

To first evaluate the effects of the polymerization environment,
phospholipid nanoshell-encapsulated eGFP and td-Tomato were exposed
to UV irradiation/elevated temperatures, in the absence of radical
initiators, and the fluorescence intensity of the protein was measured.
The normalized emission spectra of eGFP and td-Tomato, and their relative
changes after exposure to UV or elevated temperature (80 or 40 °C),
are shown in Figures S-4 and S-5 (Supporting Information), respectively. The fluorescence spectra are normalized against the
intensity of the respective protein, encapsulated in phospholipid
nanoshells without polymerization treatment. The fluorescence spectra
indicate that eGFP completely denatured at 80 °C, although it
retained more than 90% fluorescence at 40 °C following UV irradiation.
td-Tomato protein was relatively stable at elevated temperature, but
the activity decreased significantly when exposed to UV irradiation
compared to other conditions (80 or 40 °C). These results indicate
that even in the absence of radical initiators, polymerization conditions
may affect the activity of the encapsulated cargo.

Generation
of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells further requires the
partitioning of monomers and exposure to radical initiators. In addition
to environmental conditions, the effects of monomer partitioning and
increased radical concentrations due to the presence of radical initiators
required for generation of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells were evaluated.
The initial evaluation was performed under conditions where a monomer
or initiator was excluded to prevent polymerization, allowing identification
of the key contributors of degraded protein function. eGFP or td-Tomato
was encapsulated in phospholipid nanoshells, and the resulting solution
was divided into four aliquots. One aliquot was kept at 4 °C,
and the second was exposed to UV light/elevated temperature (40 or
80 °C). To the remaining two aliquots, monomers or initiators
were added, respectively, and then these solutions were exposed to
UV light/elevated temperature (40 or 80 °C), individually. Finally,
the fluorescence intensity of protein was measured in each aliquot.
The fluorescence intensities were normalized against the intensity
of protein encapsulated in phospholipid nanoshells kept at 4 °C.
These data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and further described
below.

Before UV exposure, eGFP encapsulated in phospholipid
nanoshells
exhibits emission maxima at ∼510 nm. The observed emission
intensity of eGFP remains unaltered upon 0.5 h UV irradiation (Table 1 and Figure S-6, Supporting Information). In monomer-doped phospholipid
nanoshells, the fluorescence intensity of eGFP was retained upon UV
irradiation. A significant decrease in fluorescence intensity of eGFP
was observed in initiator-doped phospholipid nanoshells upon UV irradiation
(Figure S-6A, Supporting Information),
likely due to the generation of free radicals proximal to the eGFP.
These results indicate that the activity of eGFP encapsulated in phospholipid
nanoshells decreases under photoinitiated polymerization conditions.
In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of eGFP encapsulated in the
monomer-doped and neutral redox initiator-exposed phospholipid nanoshells
remains unchanged compared to the controls (Table 1 and Figure S-6B, Supporting Information). Hence, these observations suggest that eGFP retains
more than 90% fluorescence under neutral redox initiator-induced polymerization
conditions. Thermal initiator-induced polymerization conditions were
not evaluated for eGFP on the basis of the results of Figure S-4 (Supporting Information). Overall,
eGFP fluorescence is retained at a significantly higher level (>95%)
under neutral redox initiator-induced polymerization conditions than
under photoinitiator-induced polymerization conditions (64%), suggesting
that neutral redox initiator-induced polymerization provides the most
effective initiation for eGFP.

Similarly, the stability of td-Tomato
was evaluated under all three
initiator conditions (Table 2 and Figure S-7, Supporting Information). The fluorescence intensity of td-Tomato encapsulated in phospholipid
nanoshells decreased by 85% compared to controls upon UV irradiation
(Figure S-7A, Supporting Information).
The fluorescence intensity of td-Tomato encapsulated in monomer-doped
phospholipid nanoshells also decreased by 87% compared to controls.
However, in initiator-exposed phospholipid nanoshells, the emission
intensity of td-Tomato decreased by only 60%. The observed decrease
in fluorescence intensity of td-Tomato in initiator-doped phospholipid
nanoshells likely results from the generation of free radicals from
the initiator under UV irradiation that may alter the structure and
decrease the activity of td-Tomato. In contrast, the fluorescence
intensity of td-Tomato protein was unchanged in monomer- and initiator-doped
phospholipid nanoshells incubated at 40 °C, the temperature required
for neutral redox initiator-induced polymerization (Figure S-7B, Supporting Information). The emission intensity
of td-Tomato encapsulated in phospholipid nanoshells exhibited a decrease
upon exposure to thermal initiator-induced polymerization conditions,
although the decrease associated with the temperature and monomer
doping (22% and 23%, respectively) was significantly reduced compared
to UV irradiation (Figure S-7C, Supporting Information). Conversely, exposure to the initiator led to a larger decrease
in emission intensity (87%) than in photoinitiator-induced polymerization
(40%). Unlike eGFP, td-Tomato fluorescence is quite stable at elevated
temperature (∼80 °C). Thus, td-Tomato encapsulated in
phospholipid nanoshells is moderately thermally stable but not stable
in the presence of thermal initiators and the associated high radical
concentrations.

The enhanced stability of fluorescent proteins
encapsulated in
phospholipid nanoshells observed under neutral redox conditions compared
to thermal and UV irradiation likely results from a combination of
the actual initiator and the condition required to generate radicals.35,60,61 The elevated temperature required
for thermal initiation is uniform throughout the solution; thus, the
encapsulated protein receives no protection from the phospholipid
nanoshell. Additionally, the thermal initiator is a weak base, which
may partition into the internal space of the phospholipid nanoshell,
enabling direct reaction with the protein. Although UV photoinitiators
are membrane-soluble and likely accumulate in the bilayer lamella,
spatially restricting radical generation, the excess of hydroxyl radicals
produced throughout the solution likely damages the protein. Thus,
the milder, neutral redox polymerization, which yields low concentrations
of membrane-impermeant anionic radicals, likely contributes to the
enhanced stability observed.

To evaluate the stability of protein
encapsulated in PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells following polymerization with that of unstabilized phospholipid
nanoshells, we measured the fluorescence intensity of eGFP and td-Tomato
before and after formation of polymer scaffolds. As the thermal initiator
method was deemed not suitable for preparation of PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells that encapsulate functional proteins, we compared the stability
of both proteins under photoinitiator- and neutral redox initiator-induced
PSS-phospholipid nanoshell formation. The relative changes in normalized
intensity of encapsulated eGFP and td-Tomato before and after formation
of polymer scaffolds using photoinitiator and neutral redox initiator
are shown in Figure 2. Both eGFP and td-Tomato exhibit >90% fluorescence intensity
of
control in neutral redox initiator-induced PSS-phospholipid nanoshells,
although the activity decreases moderately (20% for eGFP and 50% for
td-Tomato) under photoinitiator-induced polymerization.

(a) phospholipid nanoshells exposed to polymerizing conditions, but
lacking initiator; (b) photoinitiator-induced PSS-phospholipid nanoshells;
and (c) neutral redox initiator-induced PSS-phospholipid nanoshells.
Fluorescence intensities are normalized to the corresponding encapsulation
within unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells.

To further evaluate whether the eGFP and td-Tomato encapsulated
in PSS-phospholipid nanoshells are suitable for microscopic studies,
fluorescence images were obtained using an epifluorescence microscope. Figures S-8 and S-9 (Supporting Information) show
images of eGFP and td-Tomato encapsulated in PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
prepared using photoinitiator and neutral redox initiator and subsequently
deposited onto glass slides. In each image, several punctate fluorescence
sources were detected. The eGFP and td-Tomato encapsulating PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells were observed as discrete spots that were highly fluorescent
and observed through multiple image frames. Unstabilized phospholipid
nanoshells have the tendency to fuse on glass surfaces62 and subsequently release and dilute the encapsulated
species, making detection of punctate sources difficult. The presence
and long-term observation of the corresponding PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
further support the enhanced stability afforded by the polymer scaffold
and enable more reliable observation of individual nanoshells.

Co-loading
of eGFP and td-Tomato in Phospholipid Nanoshells
To demonstrate
the possibility of designing multicolor biosensors
using PSS-phospholipid nanoshells and evaluate the simultaneous effects
on protein activity, eGFP and td-Tomato were co-encapsulated in PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells. Co-encapsulation of both proteins was confirmed by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figure S-10, Supporting Information), which shows that both proteins elute at the same
volume with an effective separation from free proteins. To further
investigate the effects of co-encapsulation on fluorescence intensity,
the fluorescence intensity of eGFP and td-Tomato co-encapsulated in
phospholipid nanoshells was measured under photoinitiator and neutral
redox initiator polymerization conditions (Figure S-11, Supporting Information). Under photoinitiator and neutral
redox initiator conditions, the relative change in intensity is similar
to that of protein encapsulated in phospholipid nanoshells separately
(Tables 1 and 2 and Figures S-6 and S-7, Supporting Information).

We then measured the fluorescence intensity
of both proteins co-encapsulated in PSS-phospholipid nanoshells, before
and after formation of polymer scaffolds (Figure 3). The observed reductions in fluorescence
intensity for the co-encapsulated proteins were equivalent to the
values for individual encapsulation, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, eGFP and td-Tomato
exhibit similar trends in retention of activity in PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells after individual encapsulation and co-encapsulation.

Figure 3 Relative change
in fluorescence intensity of encapsulated (A) eGFP
and (B) td-Tomato when co-encapsulated in phospholipid nanoshells
before and after formation of polymer scaffolds using photoinitiator
and neutral redox initiator. For each plot, the letter designations
are as follows: (a) phospholipid nanoshells exposed to polymerizing
conditions, but lacking initiator; (b) photoinitiator-induced PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells; and (c) neutral redox initiator-induced PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells. Fluorescence intensities are normalized to the corresponding
encapsulation within unstabilized phospholipid nanoshells.

Finally, Figure 4 shows a series of fluorescence images collected using
emission filters
for eGFP and td-Tomato in PSS-phospholipid nanoshells. In these images,
only PSS-nanoshells that contain at least one fluorescent protein
can be visualized. Punctate fluorescence sources were observed corresponding
to eGFP and td-Tomato encapsulated individually in PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells, as well as co-encapsulation of the proteins. An expanded
view of part iii is shown in part iv for Figure 4A,B, which more clearly shows the presence
of individual protein loaded and co-loaded PSS-phospholipid nanoshells.
Empirically, PSS-phospholipid nanoshells prepared using UV photoinitiator
showed lower percentages of nanoshells containing only DsRed than
those prepared with neutral redox initiators, agreeing well with bulk
measurements in Figure 3. Interestingly, a higher fraction of nanoshells that contained both
proteins was observed than predicted on the basis of bulk measurements
(ca. 50% for each initiator, compared to ca. 25% expected for random
distributions), although the nature of this observation is unknown.
Combined, these observations suggest that co-encapsulation does not
negatively affect fluorescence intensity and that individual protein-encapsulating
PSS nanoshells can be observed. Furthermore, these measurements demonstrate
the benefits of using proper initiation methods for preparing stabilized
PSS-phospholipid nanoshells for co-encapsulation of sensor components.

Conclusions
PSS-phospholipid
nanoshells were prepared by partition and subsequent
polymerization of hydrophobic methacrylate monomers in the presence
of photoinitiator, neutral redox initiator, and thermal initiator,
individually. Polymerization induced by each type of initiator was
sufficient to stabilize the PSS-phospholipid nanoshell to harsh chemical
environments, and generally, all three initiation approaches provided
equivalent stabilization, with minor differences in the size of the
resulting PSS-phospholipid nanoshells. Investigation of the fluorescence
activity of encapsulated model fluorescent proteins revealed substantial
differences between each initiation pathway. The neutral redox initiation
approach yielded the maximum retention of fluorescence activity for
both eGFP and td-Tomato, whereas photoinitiation and thermal initiation
resulted in approximately equivalent stabilization. This work clearly
demonstrates the importance of optimizing polymerization conditions
for polymeric, biofunctionalized nanomaterials, is broadly applicable
beyond the design of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells, and demonstrates
the feasibility of a new neutral radical polymerization initiation
approach.

Experimental Section
Materials
1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 2-Methyl-4′-(methylthio)-2-morpholinopropiophenone
(Irgacure 907), 2,2′-azo-bis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride
(AAPD), (NH4)2S2O8, NaHSO3, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), and Triton X-100
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Uranyl acetate
and n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) were purchased from
Electron Microscopy Sciences and Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA), respectively.
Aluminum oxide (neutral, 50–200 μm) was purchased from
Acros Organics (Morris, NJ). The structures of DOPC, BMA, EGDMA, Irgacure
907, and AAPD are shown in Scheme S-1 (Supporting Information).

Hexahistidine-tagged eGFP and td-Tomato
were expressed and purified in-house. Both proteins were expressed
in BL21(DE3) competent Escherichia coli (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and purified with TALON
metal affinity resins (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View,
CA).

All experiments were performed in 10 mM phosphate-buffered
saline
(PBS) (8 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) and prepared with deionized
water (18 MΩ cm).

Preparation of Phospholipid Nanoshells
Unilamellar
phospholipid nanoshells were prepared by film hydration followed by
freeze-thaw and extrusion.46 Briefly, 10
mg of DOPC in CHCl3 was dried with Ar and further vacuum-dried
for ≥4 h to completely remove trace CHCl3. Dried
lipid films were rehydrated using 1 mL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The
lipid solution was flushed with Ar, warmed to 42 °C, and vortexed
gently to resuspend the lipid. The lipid solution then went through
10 cycles of freeze–thaw–vortex in isopropanol–dry
ice (−77 °C) and warm water (42 °C). Finally, the
resulting solution was extruded 21 times through two stacked Nuclepore
polycarbonate membrane filters (200 nm) using a stainless steel extruder
(Avanti Polar Lipids, Birmingham, AL). The extruded phospholipid nanoshell
solution was then diluted with PBS (pH 7.4) to a total volume of 5
mL (final DOPC concentration = 2 mg/mL).

Formation of Polymer Scaffolds
in Phospholipid Nanoshells
PSS-phospholipid nanoshells were
prepared using BMA and EGDMA,
with three different initiation methods: (a) Irgacure 907 photoinitiator,
(b) AAPD thermal initiator, and (c) (NH4)2S2O8/NaHSO3 neutral redox initiator pair.
The monomer to initiator mole ratio was maintained at 5:1 in all polymerizations.
Briefly, ∼14 μmol of BMA and ∼11 μmol of
EGDMA were added to freshly prepared phospholipid (5 mL; 2 mg/mL)
nanoshells. The solution was stirred overnight in the dark at 24 ±
2 °C to maximize the partitioning of hydrophobic monomers into
the bilayer lamella. The monomer-doped phospholipid nanoshell solution
was then polymerized using the different initiators as described below.

Photoinitiation
Irgacure 907 was dissolved in methanol
at 10 mg/mL immediately before use. The required amount (monomer to
initiator mole ratio = 5:1) of initiator stock solution was transferred
into a glass vial, dried with Ar, and lyophilized for ∼1.5
to 2 h. Monomer-doped nanoshell was added and stirred in the dark
to complete partitioning. The monomer- and initiator-doped nanoshell
solution was purged with Ar for 10 min and then polymerized with a
100 W Hg arc lamp for 0.5 h. The solution was constantly stirred during
polymerization to ensure homogeneous exposure.

Thermal Initiation
AAPD was recrystallized in water
and dried under vacuum. The recrystallized AAPD was dissolved in PBS
buffer at 10 mg/mL immediately before use. AAPD (monomer to initiator
mole ratio = 5:1) was added to the monomer-doped phospholipid nanoshell
solution. The suspension was degassed with Ar for 10 min and heated
at 80 °C in the dark for 17 h with continuous stirring to initiate
polymerization.

Neutral Redox Initiation
(NH4)2S2O8 and NaHSO3 are used as neutral
redox initiator pair.63 (NH4)2S2O8 and NaHSO3 were
dissolved separately in PBS buffer at 10 mg/mL, each immediately before
use. (NH4)2S2O8 and NaHSO3 solution (monomer to initiator mole ratio = 5:1) were added
to the monomer-doped phospholipid nanoshell solution. The suspension
was degassed with Ar for 10 min and heated at 40 °C in the dark
for 2 h with continuous stirring to initiate polymerization.

Isolation of Polymer Scaffolds
To isolate the polymer
scaffold from phospholipid nanoshells, the phospholipid was removed
by washing the PSS-phospholipid nanoshells with methanol. Initially,
methanol was added to the aqueous suspension of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
and centrifuged to precipitate the polymer scaffolds. The precipitate
was then resuspended in methanol and washed repeatedly with methanol
to remove DOPC completely. Finally, the isolated polymer scaffolds
were washed with H2O and freeze-dried. Because methanol
is used to break the phospholipid nanoshells64 and phospholipids are completely soluble in methanol, the isolated
precipitates are most likely composed of polymer scaffolds. The isolated
polymer scaffold was then dispersed in methanol for analysis by SEM.

Encapsulation of Fluorescent Proteins in Phospholipid Nanoshells
The encapsulation of fluorescent proteins, eGFP and td-Tomato,
into unstabilized and stabilized phospholipid nanoshells was performed
by 10 cycles of freeze–thaw–vortex in isopropanol–dry
ice (−77 °C) and warm water (42 °C), followed by
extrusion and SEC.5 During protein encapsulation,
eGFP and/or td-Tomato dissolved in PBS was added to dried DOPC films.
Initially, the protein-containing lipid solution was warmed to 42
°C for 2 min and vortexed to resuspend the lipid thoroughly.
Finally, the solution was exposed to freeze–thaw–vortex
cycles as described. Unencapsulated protein was removed by SEC using
a Sepharose CL-4B column (Sigma-Aldrich) and PBS buffer
as eluent. The encapsulation efficiency was 20% ± 8% and 17%
± 6% for eGFP and td-Tomato, respectively. Similarly, during
co-loading, the encapsulation efficiency was 17 ± 7% and 12 ±
5% for eGFP and td-Tomato, respectively. PSS-phospholipid nanoshells
were prepared by partitioning monomers (BMA and EGDMA) into the bilayer
of phospholipid nanoshells and subsequently polymerized using the
experimental initiation methods.

Characterization of PSS-Phospholipid
Nanoshells
DLS
was used to measure phospholipid nanoshell sizes. DLS measurement
of phospholipid nanoshells and PSS-phospholipid nanoshell size was
performed using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Worcestershire, United
Kingdom) with a backscattering angle of 173°. The measurements
were made for each sample at 24 ± 2 °C.

The optical
density of nanoshell solutions was measured by a Thermo Fisher Scientific
NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer at 630 nm using a cuvette with a
1 cm path length.

The fluorescence of eGFP and td-Tomato was
analyzed using a PTI
QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence intensities
were monitored by excitation of the samples at 488 nm (for eGFP) and
554 nm (for td-Tomato).

TEM images were collected using a Tecnai
G2 Spirit transmission
electron microscope. Uranyl acetate (0.3 wt %) was used as the staining
agent of PSS-phospholipid nanoshells.

SEM measurement of polymer
scaffolds was performed using an FEI
Inspec-S SEM equipped with a standard imaging backscattered electron
detector, an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system, and
a JC Nabity Nanometer Pattern Generation System.

Protein-encapsulated
PSS-phospholipid nanoshells were imaged using
a Hamamatsu ImagEM X2 digital camera attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE300
Quantum inverted epifluorescence microscope. Emission was collected
through an oil-immersion objective (40×, numerical aperture =
1.30), with a filter cube (green filter, 540 nm/25 nm; red filter,
620 nm/60 nm). HCImage Live software was used to collect the images,
and ImageJ software was used to analyze the images.65
