Compound promiscuity is often attributed
to nonspecific binding
or assay artifacts. On the other hand, it is well-known that many
pharmaceutically relevant compounds are capable of engaging multiple
targets in vivo, giving rise to polypharmacology. To explore and better
understand promiscuous binding characteristics of small molecules,
we have searched X-ray structures (and very few qualifying solution
structures) for ligands that bind to multiple distantly related or
unrelated target proteins. Experimental structures of a given ligand
bound to different targets represent high-confidence data for exploring
promiscuous binding events. A total of 192 ligands were identified
that formed crystallographic complexes with proteins from different
families and for which activity data were available. These “multifamily”
compounds included endogenous ligands and were often more polar than
other bound compounds and active in the submicromolar range. Unexpectedly,
many promiscuous ligands displayed conserved or similar binding conformations
in different active sites. Others were found to conformationally adjust
to binding sites of different architectures. A comprehensive analysis
of ligand–target interactions revealed that multifamily ligands
frequently formed different interaction hotspots in binding sites,
even if their bound conformations were similar, thus providing a rationale
for promiscuous binding events at the molecular level of detail. As
a part of this work, all multifamily ligands we have identified and
associated activity data are made freely available.

1 Introduction
Compound
optimization efforts in medicinal chemistry traditionally
aim to develop drug candidates that are highly selective and potent
toward a specific biological target. This principle is based upon
the assumption that therapeutic effects following drug administration
solely result from interactions with a single target. However, this
paradigm was called into question and revised when it became evident
that the efficacy of drugs, but also side effects, frequently depended
on multitarget activities and associated functional consequences,
a concept referred to as “polypharmacology”.1−6

Despite the relevance of polypharmacology for drug efficacy,
compounds
with promiscuous binding behavior are often viewed controversially.7,8 This is the case because high hit rates of small molecules in biological
assays are frequently not the result of multiple binding events.9 Rather, aggregation effects and potential chemical
reactivities under assay conditions can lead to false positive assay
signals.9−12 In light of concerns about such artifacts, studying multitarget
activities of ligands and differentiating between false positive and
true positive interactions have become important tasks in medicinal
chemistry and biological screening.13−17

In addition to their relevance for drug development,
the study
of promiscuous small molecules is also of high interest in basic research.
Importantly, physiological effects of endogenous chemical entities
such as coenzymes, substrates, or transmitters are often elicited
because of their ability to interact with distantly related or unrelated
proteins having diverse functions.18,19 Hence, “true”
promiscuity represents an evolutionary principle for physiologically
relevant ligands. However, the molecular basis of promiscuous binding
events remains to be further explored.

Although the ligand specificity
paradigm will continue to play
an important role in drug discovery, there are many opportunities
to utilize polypharmacology.3 For example,
multitarget compounds used for the treatment of a given pathology
might be repositioned for other therapeutic applications that require
engagement of different targets.20 A text
book example of such repurposing efforts is methotrexate, a drug used
for many years in cancer treatment, which has recently found alternative
low-dose applications in the treatment of inflammatory disorders like
psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.21 Notably,
polypharmacology has high potential for treatment of diseases that
result from perturbation of target networks and associated signaling
pathways. Promiscuous kinase inhibitors successfully used in oncology
are prime examples for compounds that interfere with target networks
and their signaling cascades.22

Given
the complex nature of polypharmacology, rational design of
multitarget ligands is an equally challenging and attractive area
of research.3,7,23−25 To this end, several studies have attempted to determine
structure–activity relationship profiles of multitarget compounds.
For example, on the basis of publicly available activity data, compounds
with multitarget activity were identified and similarity relationships
between them were explored.25−27 Furthermore, X-ray structures
were used to associate multitarget drugs with proteins having similar
functions,28 relate multitarget activities
of ligands to protein binding site similarity,29 or identify compounds bound to targets from different families
(multifamily ligands).30 Although structural
data are limited, studying multitarget and multifamily ligands on
the basis of complex X-ray structures, rather than assay data, has
the intrinsic advantage that these binding events are confirmed at
the molecular level of detail and can be investigated as such.

Herein, we have searched for multifamily ligands with available
X-ray [or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)] structures to better understand
origins of ligand promiscuity across different target families. Therefore,
we have carried out a systematic search for experimental structures
of small molecules bound to multiple targets from different protein
families. A set of structure-based multifamily compounds was identified
that included endogenous ligands as well as approved drugs. Molecular
properties and bound conformations of these multifamily ligands were
systematically analyzed and interaction hotspots in different protein
binding sites were identified. Taken together, the results of our
analysis shed light on the ability of small molecules to interact
with distantly or unrelated targets.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Identification and Characterization
of Multifamily
Ligands
From 112 212 structures (entries) available
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB),31 26 073
bound ligands were extracted. These ligands included 6496 organic
compounds with a molecular weight of at least 300 Da and one or more
reported activity values (in original references) of at least 10 μM
(pIC50, pKi, or pKd ≥ 5). This set of PDB ligands provided the basis
of our study.

The preselected ligands were subjected to a two-stage
analysis. First, target family assignments were computationally carried
out in a consistent manner (without subjective intervention) to identify
ligands that were active against different target families and ensure
reproducibility of the analysis (see Materials and
Methods). Second, for each designated multifamily ligand, assigned
targets and binding domains were carefully compared to examine similarities
between targets from different families and prioritize multifamily
ligands for promiscuity analysis, as further discussed below.

Computational analysis of the preselected PDB ligands identified
192 compounds that formed complexes with a variety of target proteins
from 2 to 16 different families. These 192 compounds were designated
multifamily ligands and further analyzed. Figure 1 shows exemplary compounds and Figure 2 shows the distribution of
multifamily ligands over protein families. Kinases and other transferases
formed the largest number of complexes with multifamily ligands (with
42 and 36 ligands, respectively). The majority of complex structures
involved cytosolic enzymes, which are overrepresented in the PDB because
of ease of crystallization.

Figure 1 Exemplary multifamily ligands. For each ligand,
the PDB Ligand
Expo identifier (PDB-ID) is given and the number of qualifying complex
X-ray structures (entries), targets, and target families is reported.
Shown are exemplary ligands from (a) subset IV and (b) subset III.

Figure 2 Distribution of multifamily ligands over target
families. The bar
plot reports the distribution of multifamily ligands over families
of crystallographic targets according to the ChEMBL protein family
classification scheme.

Multifamily ligands were available in complexes with 2 to
131 crystallographic
targets, with a median value of 3 unique targets per ligand. The 192
ligands were represented by a total of 3398 complex structures. These
structures only included 20 solution (NMR) structures of ligand–protein
complexes and 34 NMR structures of ligand–DNA complexes (for
completeness, DNA was included as a biological target). The small
number of solution structures only entered the initial statistical
analysis of multifamily ligands. Subsequent analysis was focused on
X-ray structures. Distributions of potency (pIC50, pKi, or pKd) values
of the 192 multifamily ligands for X-ray targets are shown in Figure 3. The distributions
were broad and interquartile ranges spanned several orders of magnitude,
with median values in the low micromolar to submicromolar range.

Figure 3 Potency
values. For multifamily ligands, the distributions of different
logarithmic potency values (pIC50, pKi, and pKd) are reported in box
plots. The yellow horizontal line indicates the median value of each
distribution (reported next to the line).

In stage two of our analysis, targets of all multifamily
ligands
were compared individually and the ligands were assigned to 4 different
subsets:Subset I:
ligands whose multifamily assignment depended
on complexes with metabolizing enzymes or serum proteins (10 ligands);
II: endogenous ligands (40); III: ligands binding to similar proteins
from different families or to similar binding domains (51); and IV:
multifamily ligands interacting with distinct targets (91).



The 10 ligands from subset I were omitted
from further consideration
because binding to serum proteins or metabolizing enzymes such as
cytochromes is not relevant for polypharmacology (for all remaining
ligands, complexes with such proteins were not included in subsequent
analysis steps). Endogenous ligands such as adenosine 5′-triphosphate
(ATP) or nucleoside derivatives have evolved to interact with different
proteins. As such, these naturally occurring ligands are set apart
from synthetic compounds and should best be separately considered.
Furthermore, proteins from different families distinguished by established
classification schemes might partly be structurally related and have
similar biological functions. Therefore, subset III captured multifamily
ligands for which at least some of the participating proteins had
similar enzymatic functions or similar binding domains. By contrast,
subset IV contained ligands that interacted exclusively with unrelated
or distantly related targets (both in terms of structure and function). Figure 1a shows representative
examples of subset IV ligands such as QUE that interacts with numerous
distinct targets. Figure 1b shows subset III ligands. For example, NGH inhibits metalloproteases
from 2 different families and BMF binds to bromodomains in proteins
from 4 different families.

On the basis of our analysis, the
91 multifamily ligands belonged
to subset IV having highest priority for promiscuity analysis, given
that they interacted with unrelated targets. Therefore, specific examples
discussed below were taken from subset IV.

For the initial set
of 192 multifamily ligands and all other preselected
PDB, different molecular properties were calculated and compared,
revealing some interesting differences in the topological polar surface
area (TPSA) and S log P values.
Multifamily ligands had overall large TPSA (with a median of 145.5
Å) and low S log P values (median
1.7), indicating that multifamily ligands were generally polar. The
apparent increase in hydrophilicity among multifamily ligands was
further investigated by calculating TPSA (Figure 4a) and S log P values (Figure 4b)
for individual ligand subsets. With a median TPSA of 255.7 Å
and S log P value of −2.2,
endogenous ligands were partly—but not exclusively—responsible
for the relative increase in hydrophilicity because they included
a variety of nucleosides with phosphate groups. However, even after
removal of all subset II ligands, the remaining multifamily ligands
had detectably higher hydrophilic character than other PDB compounds,
with a median TPSA of 120.5 Å vs. 101.7 Å and median S log P value of 2.4 versus 3.4, respectively.
Thus, the multifamily activity of ligands was not attributable to
hydrophobic “stickiness”. Rather, they were more hydrophilic
in nature than many other PDB compounds, even when endogenous ligands
were excluded. Furthermore, only 17 multifamily ligands (<10%)
were found to contain substructures implicated in assay interference
effects. We also searched for structural analogues and analogue series
among multifamily ligands. Only a single series containing 3 analogues
was identified. Thus, multifamily ligands were not dominated by individual
compound classes but were structurally diverse.

Figure 4 Molecular properties.
The distributions of (a) TPSA and (b) SlogP values for endogenous multifamily
ligands (subset II, blue), remaining multifamily ligands (white),
and all preselected PDB ligands (PDB CPDs, gray) are reported in box
plots. The yellow horizontal line indicates the median value of each
distribution.

2.2 Binding
Conformations
Next, bound
conformations of each multifamily ligand were systematically superposed
and compared. Figure 5 shows exemplary pairwise superpositions of target-dependent conformations. Figure 6 shows the distribution
of Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) values resulting from exhaustive
comparison of binding conformations of all 192 multifamily ligands.
Pairwise rmsd values ranged from close to 0 to 6.0 Å, with a
median RMSD of 1.0 Å. Thus, approximately half of the comparisons
identified similar binding conformations in different structural environments.
The third quartile reached a value of 1.8 Å. At this level, conformations
of typical ligands become dissimilar. Therefore, approximately a quarter
of the comparisons indicated target-dependent conformational differences.
However, overall most bound conformations of multifamily ligands were
similar, regardless of the conformational space available to ligands
and differences in the geometry and shape of binding sites. Figure 6 also reports the
corresponding distribution of RMSD values for the 91 high-priority
ligands from subset IV. In this case, the median RMSD value was only
0.8 Å, thus even lower, despite interactions with unrelated targets.

Figure 5 Binding
conformations of a multifamily ligand. Shown are exemplary
pairwise superpositions of crystallographic conformations of doxorubicin.
As a reference conformation, doxorubicin bound to DNA (Ligand Expo
ID: DM2, PDB entry ID: 1DA9) is used (gray carbon atoms) onto which
bound conformations of doxorubicin extracted from complex structures
with diverse targets are superposed. For each superposition, the RMSD
value is reported.

Figure 6 Comparison of binding
conformations. For all 192 multifamily ligands
(MF PDB CPDs, blue) and the subset of prioritized multifamily ligands
(subset III, white), the distribution of RMSD values for all pairwise
superpositions of bound conformations is reported in a box plot. The
yellow horizontal line indicates the median value of the distributions.

Hence, it remained to be determined
how similar ligand conformations
were accommodated in different structural environments.

2.3 Target–Ligand Interactions
Therefore, a systematic
analysis of intermolecular interactions was
carried out (details are provided in Materials and
Methods). Directed polar interactions including hydrogen bonds,
ligand–metal contacts, ionic, and π-interactions were
accounted for and, in addition, van der Waals (vdW) contacts between
ligand atoms and nonpolar amino acids. These vdW contacts were quantified
as an indicator of hydrophobic interactions and shape complementarity. Figure 7 illustrates target–ligand
interaction analysis using indomethacin as an exemplary ligand bound
to human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ).32 Atoms involved in directed and/or vdW interactions
were uniquely indexed and individual atomic contacts were counted.
Then, contacts were mapped onto ligand atoms and color-coded according
to their frequency. Accordingly, dark green and dark orange atoms,
or groups of atoms, indicated centers of polar and vdW interactions,
respectively, as illustrated in Figure 7. For each multifamily ligand, interaction patterns
were then monitored separately for targets belonging to different
families and compared. The analysis revealed that multifamily ligands
mostly formed different “interaction hotspots” with
targets belonging to different families, even if bound conformations
were similar, as discussed in the following.

Figure 7 Identification of target–ligand
interaction hotspots. For
an exemplary bound ligand (green carbon atoms, Ligand Expo ID: IMN,
PDB entry 3ADS), the atom-based number of directed interactions (hydrogen
bonds, ligand–metal contacts, ionic, and π-interactions)
and vdW interactions with hydrophobic protein residues are reported.
Atoms involved in interactions are indexed. In the X-ray structure,
directed interactions are shown as dotted lines and vdW contacts are
presented as magenta spheres. In the corresponding 2D representations,
ligand atoms are color-coded according to the number of their interactions
(directed: light to dark green, vdW: light to dark orange).

For the examples presented, binding
site similarity between participating
protein families was also calculated (see Materials
and Methods) and binding sites reaching a threshold for detectable
similarity were identified.

2.4 Interaction Hotspots of
Multifamily Ligands
Interaction hotspots were defined as
ligand atoms most frequently
involved in specific ligand–target interactions. They were
calculated by mapping detectable ligand–target interactions
on participating ligand atoms and determining their frequency on a
per-atom basis (see Materials and Methods).
Thus, so-defined hotspots revealed centers of interactions in ligands
and other regions that did not participate in such interactions. Combining
the analysis of binding conformations and target–ligand interactions
made it possible to rationalize different multitarget binding events.
For example, indomethacin represents a well-characterized polypharmacological
drug33 that is known to interact with unrelated
targets including cyclooxygenases,34 phospholipase
A2,35 and PPARγ,32 and also serum albumin.36 As
revealed by its RMSD matrix in Figure 8a, indomethacin belongs to the subset of multifamily
ligands that display target-dependent differences in binding conformations
with largest RMSD values exceeding 2.0 Å. Largest conformational
variations were observed for transcription factor binding compared
to hydrolases, reductases, and secreted proteins. Hence, indomethacin
conformationally adapted to different structural environments. Figure 8b compares the interactions
between indomethacin and targets from different families. The aliphatic
carboxylic acid group of indomethacin was a conserved hotspot for
polar interactions across all 3 protein families. On the other hand,
aromatic interactions of the central indole ring moiety were only
observed in binding sites of reductases. However, vdW interactions
involving this moiety were mostly found in reductases and the transcription
factor. By contrast, in the active site of hydrolases, no interactions
with the central part of indomethacin were detectable. Thus, binding
of this drug across different target families involved both conserved
and distinct interaction patterns, which was a recurrent theme among
multifamily ligands.

Figure 8 Multifamily binding of indomethacin. (a) Shows an RMSD
value matrix
for comparison of indomethacin conformations bound to targets from
different families. Each cell represents an RMSD value for a pairwise
superposition. Cells are color-coded according to RMSD values (from
light blue (0.0 Å) to purple (maximum rmsd). (b) Shows interaction
hotspots of indomethacin for different protein families. The number
of targets per family is given in parentheses. The representation
of interaction hotspots is according to Figure 7. A low binding site similarity was detected
for transcription factors, secreted proteins, and hydrolases.

The HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir37 is an example of a multifamily ligand with different
binding conformations,
yielding largest RMSD values exceeding 3.0 Å (Figure 9a). Among other targets, ritonavir
is known to bind to cytochrome P450 enzymes, which causes undesirable
side effects and drug interactions.38 The
peptidomimetic nature of ritonavir with a large number of rotatable
bonds supports flexibility of binding conformations. Accordingly,
as shown in Figure 9b, this ligand displayed different polar interaction patterns when
bound to proteases and hydrolases that were closely related and had
significant binding site similarity. Polar interactions in proteases
and hydrolases were centered on a hydroxyl group, while distinct polar
hotspots were identified for the thiazole ring. Moreover, this ligand
displayed overlapping yet distinct vdW interactions in different binding
sites with three hotspots, only one of which (the central phenyl moiety)
was shared by the two target families. Hence, ritonavir provided an
intuitive example of a multifamily ligand where conformational adaptability
was accompanied by the formation of different interaction hotspots.

Figure 9 Multifamily
binding of ritonavir. (a) RMSD matrix. (b) Interaction
hotspots for different protein families. The presentation is according
to Figure 8. A high
binding site similarity was detected for hydrolases and proteases.

Because ligand binding across
different protein families was not
only attributable to conformational variability and resulting differences
in interaction hotspots, we reasoned that differences in interaction
patterns should also be present for multifamily ligands that bound
with similar conformations to different targets. For example, quercetin
is a relatively small and rigid compound that belongs to the large
subset of multifamily ligands with essentially conserved binding conformations
across different target families (with only one exception), as illustrated
by its RMSD matrix in Figure 10a. Quercetin contains a polyphenolic flavonoid scaffold. Notably,
flavonoids were considered privileged substructures in drug discovery39 capable of forming interactions with kinases,40 DNA,41 or hydrolases.42 In addition, there is crystallographic evidence
for the oxidative cleavage of quercetin by quercetinase.43 However, polyphenols such as quercetin were
also implicated in reactivity under assay conditions and other potential
liabilities such as membrane perturbation, adding them to the spectrum
of interference compounds.12,13 X-ray structures of
quercetin in complex with DNA and targets from three protein families
also revealed both conserved and family-dependent interaction hotspots,
as shown in Figure 10b. The 3-hydroxy group of quercetin was consistently involved in
target–ligand interactions, whereas the carbonyl oxygen formed
a hydrolase-specific interaction hot spot. The C-ring of quercetin
was involved in π-interactions in all complexes except when
bound to hydrolases. Especially in kinases, all three rings were involved
in aromatic interactions. In addition, extensive vdW contacts were
formed when quercetin was bound to reductases and kinases, which were
largely absent in hydrolases (and DNA).

Figure 10 Multifamily binding
of quercetin. (a) RMSD matrix. (b) Interaction
hotspots for different protein families. No binding site similarity
was detected.

Comparable conformational
invariance was also observed for the
chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, given its rigid structure. The
presumed mechanism of action of doxorubicin involves the intercalation
of the planar anthracycline core with the DNA double helix.44 Similar to quercetin, doxorubicin contains structural
elements that contribute to ligand–target interactions but
also cause assay liabilities and potentially adverse pharmacological
effects.45−47 In light of the complex pharmacokinetics of anthracyclines,
interactions of doxorubicin with different target proteins were analyzed
in a number of crystallographic investigations including complexes
with efflux pumps48 and cytosolic reductases.49 Because of the rigidity of the anthracycline
core, limited conformational flexibility was due to bond rotation
in the terminal carboxylic acid and aminoglycoside moiety, respectively
(Figure 11a). Rather
unexpectedly, interaction analysis of doxorubicin revealed that π-interactions
of the aromatic core were only dominant when binding to DNA but that
vdW contacts involving this moiety were preferentially observed in
complexes with reductases and a transporter (Figure 11b). By contrast, the primary amine of the
aminoglycoside was found to be a conserved interaction hotspot across
3 protein families. On the other hand, carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygens
of the central anthracycline core only formed polar contacts when
binding to reductases. Thus, polar and vdW interactions distinguished
binding of doxorubicin in different structural environments.

Figure 11 Multifamily
binding of doxorubicin. (a) RMSD matrix. (b) Interaction
hotspots for different protein families. No binding site similarity
was detected.

The ATP-competitive
kinase inhibitor dinaciclib has much more conformational
freedom than quercetin and doxorubicin. However, it also bound with
similar conformations to cyclin-dependent kinases50 and epigenetic regulators,51 as shown in Figure 12a, with a maximum RMSD value of 1.6 Å. Cyclin-dependent kinases
and epigenetic regulators had detectable binding site similarity. Figure 12b compares interaction
hotspots of dinaciclib with these 2 protein families. In both cases,
extensive vdW interactions with essentially all parts of the inhibitor
were observed, reflecting a high degree of shape complementarity in
these binding sites. By contrast, distinct hotspots for polar interactions
emerged. For epigenetic regulators, directed interactions with the
central pyrazol[1,5-a]pyrimidine scaffold were detected. On the other
hand, charge-assisted interactions and π-interactions involving
the pyridine-N-oxide moiety were prevalent in complexes
with kinases. Accordingly, dinaciclib was also representative of many
multifamily ligands that had largely conserved binding conformations
across different targets but formed different interaction hotspots
in changing protein environments.

epigenetic regulators and kinases was detected.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have systematically
identified ligands with available
experimental structures of complexes with targets from different families.
These structures of multifamily ligands provided firm evidence for
the presence of true binding events. Properties and binding characteristics
of multifamily ligands were analyzed in detail to better understand
the molecular basis of their promiscuous binding behavior. Multifamily
ligands also included drugs with known polypharmacology. Surprisingly,
multifamily ligands were overall slightly more hydrophilic than other
PDB compounds. Moreover, many—but not all—multifamily
ligands had similar binding conformations when interacting with targets
from different families. In some instances, conformational variability
in different binding sites was expectedly accompanied by the formation
of different interaction hotspots. In other cases, conserved binding
conformations of rigid or flexible ligands revealed overlapping yet
distinct interaction hotspots across different target families. The
formation of target family-dependent interaction hotspots in the presence
of variable or conserved binding conformations emerged as a recurrent
theme across multifamily ligands. The ligands interacted similarly
with targets from the same family, leading to family-dependent hotspots,
but interaction hotspots clearly
differed between families. These observations provided a rationale
for the promiscuous binding capacity of ligands at the molecular level
of detail.

4 Materials and Methods
All calculations
were carried out using in-house Python scripts
with the aid of RDKit52 and the OpenEye’s
chemistry toolkit,53 KNIME protocols,54 and the molecular operating environment (MOE).55

4.1 Ligands from X-ray Structures
X-ray
structures and associated compound data were extracted from the Ligand
Expo section56 of the PDB and complemented
with experimental binding affinity data from the PDBbind database.57 Ligands were considered for further analysis
if they had a minimum molecular weight of 300 Da and if at least one
activity value of 10 μM (pIC50, pKi, or pKd) or better was available.
Application of the molecular weight and activity cutoff ensured that
salts, small organic components, and molecular fragments were excluded.
Molecular descriptors of PDB ligands were calculated using RDKit.
PDB ligands were screened in silico for structures containing Pan
Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS)11 utilizing
SMARTS58 strings obtained from three publicly
available filters (ZINC,59 RDKit, and ChEMBL60).

4.2 Target Family Distribution
For crystallographic
targets, family assignments were obtained by matching UniProt61 target identifiers to ChEMBL identifiers and
applying the ChEMBL protein family classification scheme. In addition,
the number of targets per compound was determined on the basis of
unique UniProt identifiers.

4.3 Searching for Structural
Analogues
A systematic search for analogues among multifamily
ligands was carried
out using a matched molecular pair-based computational method.62

4.4 Analysis of Binding Conformations
For each multifamily ligand, bound conformations were extracted
from
the corresponding X-ray complexes and superposed. From these superpositions,
pairwise RMSD values of ligand conformations were calculated using
MOE.

4.5 Analysis of Target–Ligand Interactions
For multifamily ligands, crystallographic target–ligand
interactions were systematically analyzed using a KNIME implementation
of MOE if two or more complexes representing a protein family were
available. Crystallographic water molecules were removed from X-ray
structures to avoid overestimation of water contacts in complexes.63 Nonbonded interactions involving ligand atoms
were determined within a radius of 4.5 Å. Hydrogen bonds, ligand–metal
contacts, ionic, and π-interactions were identified with the
aid an empirical geometry-based scoring function.64 In addition, vdW contacts between ligand atoms and hydrophobic
protein residues were determined by applying a maximal interaction
energy of −0.5 kcal/mol. The sum of all polar and vdW interactions
was calculated for each multifamily ligand atom over all binding sites
in X-ray structures of a given protein family. For each family, the
atom-based number of interactions was mapped onto a 2D representation
of the ligand64 using the chemistry toolkit
of RDKit. Atom positions were color-coded according to the number
of mapped interactions.

4.6 Binding Site Similarity
Similarity
of binding sites from different protein families was analyzed using
ProBiS.65 For pairwise comparison of nonredundant
targets from different families, the lowest recommended similarity z-score of 1.0 was applied as a threshold for detectable
binding site similarity.65 If a pairwise
comparison yielded a score of 1.0 or greater, the binding sites were
classified as similar.
