Effective transportation of fly ash–water slurry
through a pipeline from its generation site, a power plant, to a storage
site by replacing commercial surfactants such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium
bromide and sodium dodecyl sulfate by a natural dispersant extracted
from Sapindus laurifolia was studied. The stability of fly ash slurry was determined from its
rheological parameters, dispersant concentration, and stabilization
mechanism. From surface tensiometric data, the critical micelle concentration
of the dispersant was obtained to be 0.017 g/cc. The stabilization
of high-concentration fly ash slurry has been studied through its
rheological behavior by variation of temperature and dispersant and
ash concentration. The rheological result obtained for fly ash concentrations
in the range of 50–65% slurry was best justified by the Bingham
plastic model. The wettability of fly ash particles is increased in
the presence of dispersants, which is inferred from reduction of the
surface tension value. The stabilization mechanism of the slurry is
explained by a steric factor as indicated by the decrease in the zeta
potential value. Air pollution is minimized at its destination site
due to agglomeration of fly ash particles, which is confirmed from
the SEM microphotograph.

==== Body
Introduction
Most of the energy requirement of India comes from
burning fossil fuel. In more than 60% of the thermal power plants
in India, a fine-grained particulate material known as fly ash is
produced from burning of coal in a coal-fired boiler in the power
plant and gets carried off in the flue gas. The fly ash is collected
from the flue gas before it is released into the atmosphere, causing
air pollution by means of particulate air pollution control equipment.
Even though the massive production rate of fly ash in India attained
only a utilization rate of around 45% in the cement industry, those
from the production of building materials and others are disposed
of onto land through landfills or ash ponds.
It has been reported by some researchers that fly ash-derived particles
may be used in potential drug delivery systems,1,2 anti-biofouling
systems,3 and low-cost adsorbents for removal
of organic dyes and geolite synthesis.4 Many environmental problems related to soil, air, and water pollution
escalate due to fly ash. Fly ashes are usually disposed of onto ash
ponds in a slurry form through pipelines from thermal power plants.
Such a type of disposal system requires a large amount of water and
energy, which makes the process uneconomical as fly ashes with concentrations
varying from 10 to 15% are transported. The economical transportation
of solid concentration slurry should be high, which in turn requires
less amount of water, a low energy requirement for pumping, and low-energy
wastage, which is an environmentally friendly and emerging trend.5−7 This causes an increase in slurry
viscosity and yield stress; therefore, more pumping power is required
for transportation and it is very much essential to know the rheological
behavior of the slurry at various ash concentrations. Furthermore,
it is also necessary to study the surface effect of the surfactant
and other microscopic particles.8 The transportation
of high-volume fly ash slurry through long distances in pipelines
is always challenged by friction loss, elevated energy consumption,
and high settlement rate in the pipelines. There have been several
attempts to transport high-concentration fly ash slurry in pipelines
all over the world. In the past decade, a number of techniques have
been investigated, which alter the flow behavior of slurry either
by reducing the pressure drop or reducing adversely the impact of
rheological properties.
The flow behavior of fly ash slurry depends on different factors,
for instance, shape of particles, particle size distribution, solid
concentration in slurry, and slurry viscosity.9 Viscosity and shear stress of slurry could be decreased by adding
different additives, thereby enhancing the possibilities of a high
percentage of solids in the slurry transportation.10 Many investigators have examined the effects of various
additives on the rheological behavior of fly ash slurry at high concentrations
during pipeline transportation. A substantial reduction in the viscosity
of the slurry was observed by using 0.1% sodium hexametaphosphate
by mass.6 The fly ash slurry stabilization
by considering the combined effect of 0.1% sodium hexametaphosphate
and particle size distribution at different ash concentrations were
reported, which ensue non-Newtonian rheology of the slurry.11 The reduction of Bingham plastic viscosity,
yield stress by using sodium carbonate (0.2% by mass) and Henko detergent
(5:1) as an additive in fly ash concentration from 50 to 70% by mass.12 The outcomes of dispersants such as cetyl trimethyl
ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate on stabilization of
fly ash slurry in the solid concentration range from 20 to 40% at
varying temperatures from 20 to 40 °C reported that the apparent
viscosity and shear stress decrease with the increase in temperature
even without an additive and the optimized additive concentration
in the range of 0.2 to 0.3% by mass.13−16

With respect to
the charge on the surface, three types of dispersants (cationic, anionic,
and nonionic polymers such as cetylpyridinium chloride, sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS), and Triton X-100, respectively) are established to
reduce viscosity, and a shear stress of 40% mass concentration of
fly ash slurry was reported.17 The flow
behaviors of high-concentration fly ash slurries with a solid concentration
of 32 to 49% can be illustrated by the non-Newtonian power law model
as they are greatly pseudo-plastic in nature and the relative viscosity
of slurry depends on the concentration of the solid volume fraction,
particle size, and their distribution as examined by Senapati et al.18 They have developed a model for power plant
ash slurry, integrating the maximum solid fraction, median particle
size, coefficient of uniformity, and shear rate power law index to
predict the apparent viscosity. Particle gradation has a remarkable
effect on the ash concentration and pressure drop observed by Kumar
et al.19 that comparatively less energy
required for transportation and even less energy than fine ash slurry
for optimized particle size distribution that is the ratio of fly
ash and bottom ash in the range 4:1 to 3:2.
The mixture of surfactants tris(2-hydroxy-ethyl) tallow alkyl ammonium
acetate [tallow alkyl N-(C2H4)(OH)3], sodium salicylate used as a counterion, and copper
hydroxide [Cu(OH)2] in a certain ratio can stabilize the
fly ash slurry to a considerable extent.20 Elizabet et al.21 have investigated the
effect of an anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate, on the fly
ash surface at different concentrations and a temperature range from
50 to 80 °C. They reported that fly ash treated with a surfactant
was more hydrophobic than untreated fly ash due to the remarkable
reduction of the degree of agglomeration.

A high concentration
of ∼300 g/L fly ash slurry can competently be stabilized by
an equimolar mixture of biopolymers hydroxypropyl guar gum and xanthan
gum. The stability of fly ash–water slurry can be increased
by increasing the biopolymer concentration in a time period of ∼72
h, which is confirmed by the elastic modulus value.22 In addition to the cationic surfactant and biopolymer,
anionic surfactant SDS also exhibits an excellent stabilizing effect
on microfly ash slurry, which inhibited spontaneous coal combustion.13,23

From literature reviews, a conclusion that most of the additives
or dispersants used in fly ash slurry stabilization are synthetic
in nature and not eco-friendly can be drawn. Therefore, in the present
investigation, an attempt has been made to utilize a natural dispersant
from the plant, Sapindus laurifolia (S. laurifolia). It is saponin rich and typically
in profusion in India. Saponin is a naturally occurring nonionic surfactant,
which contains a hydrophilic component described as glyconic consisting
of polysaccharides, such as rhamnose, pentose, galactose, and glucose,
and a hydrophobic component described as aglyconic. An aglycon is
made up of steroids and triterpenes, which are linked with a polysaccharide
unit through oxygen and so on to form macromolecules.24 In this paper, we have reported the rheological behavior
of fly ash slurry using the aqueous extract of S. laurifolia as a dispersant. Also, the agglomeration of fly ash particles after
their transportation to the destination site is observed, which leads
to minimization of air pollution.

Results and Discussion
Optimization of S. laurifolia Concentration
The dispersants are the molecules that experience
steric hindrance and/or electrostatic repulsion while adsorbing on
the fly ash surface.13,25 The mechanisms of stabilization
of the slurry rely on the susceptibility of the dispersant to be attached
on the fly ash surface. The presence of surfactants in solution reduces
the surface tension or interfacial tension of the solution. Thus,
surface tension of the solvent consistently decreases with a gradual
increase in the dispersant concentration. From Figure 1, it is observed that the minimum surface
tension is achieved at 0.017 g/cc, which is the critical micelle concentration
(CMC) of the dispersant. A correlation can be established between
van der Waals forces of attraction among the fly ash particle and
the amount of dispersant adsorbed. It has been found that by adding
more of the dispersant to the slurry, the magnitude of van der Waals
forces of attraction among the fly ash particles can be minimized.
From Figure 2, it is
observed that by increasing the concentration of dispersants from
0.010 to 0.017 g/cc containing a 60% weight fraction of fly ash, the
apparent viscosity of the fly ash slurry decreases from 1680 to 503
mPa. Upon further increasing the S. laurifolia concentration, there is no appreciable reduction of the apparent
viscosity and plateau values are obtained, which may be due to the
formation of micelles and no further adsorption of dispersants on
the fly ash surface.26

Figure 2 Plot of dispersant concentration versus apparent viscosity.

Effect of Fly Ash Loading on Apparent Viscosity of Slurry
The apparent viscosity of the slurry can be altered by varying
the concentration of fly ash in the slurry, which is very important
in pipeline transportation. The viscosity of slurry is the resultant
effects of van der Waals forces among fly ash particles. Thus, the
viscosity increases with the rise in the amount of fly ash loading
as they get agglomerated at higher concentration. The indispensable
condition for better slurry transportation is during the transportation
viscosity, which should be low and high at the destination end for
better sedimentation.7,26Figure 3 describes the deviation of the apparent
viscosity of the slurry by adding different amounts of fly ash in
the range of 50–65% in the presence of an optimized dispersant
concentration (CMC) of 0.017 g/cc at a shear rate of 80 s–1. With the increase in fly ash concentration, the apparent viscosity
gradually increases up to 64% concentration of fly ash in the slurry.
Beyond the studied range of concentrations, the apparent viscosity
is not suitable for pipeline transportation due to agglomeration of
ash particles.

Figure 3 Plot of fly ash concentration versus apparent viscosity.

Rheological Behavior of the Fly Ash Slurry
For very
low-concentration slurry, a straight line passing through the origin
is obtained from the plot between shear stress and shear rate. The
slope of the line corresponds to the viscosity of the slurry, confirming
the slurry as a Newtonian fluid. On the measurement of shear stress,
varying the shear rate of the fly ash–water slurry containing
different solid weight ratios of fly ash in the presence of 0.017
g/ cc saponin, we have compared the flow characteristic of slurry
with CTAB, a commercial dispersant.14 In
the presence of both surfactants, the fly ash–water slurry
shows a linear relation between shear stress and shear rate with an
early shear yield stress value, indicating a non-Newtonian Bingham
plastic fluid in a solid weight fraction range of 50–64%.27,28 The slurry follows the equation of the Bingham plastic model 1  where γ and τ
indicate the applied shear rate and shear stress, respectively. τ0 is the yield stress, and η is defined as the Bingham
viscosity. The initial threshold of shear stress and yield stress
of slurry increases with the increase in the solid weight fraction
of fly ash in the fly ash–water slurry, which may be attributed
to the increase in particle–particle interactions due to greater
packing of fly ash. It is confirmed from Figure 4a,b that the natural dispersant, saponin
from S. laurifolia, exhibits a similar
type of flow characteristic to CTAB.

Figure 4 (a) Plot of shear stress versus shear rate of fly ash
slurry in the presence of a natural dispersant. (b) Plot of shear
stress versus shear rate of fly ash slurry in the presence of commercial
surfactant CTAB.

Effect of Temperature on Apparent Viscosity
There is
a correlation between the viscosity of the fluid and ease of movement
of molecules with respect to one another. With the increase in temperature,
the apparent viscosity of the slurry decreases due to the decrease
in cohesive force between the particles and the increase in dissolving
capacity of the dispersant.14,29 Therefore, the yield
stress decreases with the rise in the temperature. In our present
investigation, Figure 5 describes an exponential decrease in viscosity with the increase
in temperature. This may be due to the decrease in interparticle attraction
as the kinetic energy of fly ash particle increases. Also, first,
moving the suspended sugar chain of saponin at the fly ash–water
interface increases the mobility of the fly ash particle.29 The Arrhenius expression (eq 2) describes the relation between viscosity
and temperature that may be represented by a simple relation30 as 2  

Figure 5 Plot of apparent viscosity versus temperature.

On rearrangement, eq 2 yields eq 3 3  

The above equation
represents the apparent viscosity at a particular shear rate where T is the temperature in kelvin of the slurry, E is the activation energy for the fluid flow, R is
the universal gas constant, and A is the fitting
parameter.

Surface Activity of the Fly Ash Slurry
Dispersants
are surface active agents that reduce the interfacial tension between
solid particles and the liquid in the slurry system by lowering the
surface tension of a liquid, which improves the wettability of fly
ash particles. The stabilization of the fly ash slurry primarily depends
upon the binding tendency of the dispersant to the fly ash surface.
The more the dispersant is at ease in the solution, the less is its
tendency to be adsorbed onto the fly ash surface. Therefore, the study
of solution behavior of the dispersant in the mixture is essential.
The effect of surface tension by the dispersant depends on the replacement
of solvent molecules at the surface of solution, that is, the air–water
interface. With the increase in the exchange of solvent molecules
by the surfactant at the interface, the surface tension decreases.29 The surface tension decreases with the increase
in the dispersant molecules in the mixture and hence in the dispersant
concentration in the mixture, which indicate the segregation of the
interface that was inhibited beyond CMC. The gradual decrease in the
surface tension with the increase in dispersant concentration in the
slurry has been observed with 20% fly ash concentration, and the minimum
surface tension value of 40 mN/m at a CMC of dispersant at 0.017 g/cc
was attained and was immutable thereafter, as observed from Figure 6.31,32

Figure 6 Plot of surface tension versus dispersant concentration.

Zeta Potential Study for Measurement of Surface Charge
Yield stress, apparent viscosity, and stability of fly ash slurry
depend upon the type of functional group and magnitude of surface
charge on the fly ash particle. Thus, the flow behavior of the slurry
depends upon the surface characteristics of the fly ash particle,
which can be studied by measuring the surface charge.30,32 The surface charge is determined on the basis of the magnitude of
electrostatic repulsion and attraction between the fly ash particles
when they are kept in an electrolytic cell. Figure 7 represents the result of zeta potential
of the fly ash sample as a function of adsorbed dispersant. In the
absence of dispersants, the surface charge of the fly ash particle
was found to be −29 mV, which confirmed the negatively charged
fly ash surface. With the increase in concentration of the dispersant,
the zeta potential of fly ash slurry decreases, as observed from Figure 7. When the nonpolar
moiety of saponin adsorbs on the fly ash surface, reduction of exposed
surface charge on the fly ash particle occurs, which may be the reason
for the decreasing trend of zeta potential. Also, the projected sugar
chain may displace the original shear plane mechanically, which causes
the decrease in the zeta potential value. Several researchers have
observed this type of decreasing trend in the zeta potential value
due to the adsorption of the dispersant on solid surfaces.32−35

Figure 7 Plot of zeta potential versus of dispersant concentration.

Stabilization Mechanism of Fly Ash Slurry
In the preparation
of stable high-concentration fly ash slurry, particles should not
be agglomerated to each other, which can be achieved by creating a
repulsive barrier between the fly ash particles. Stabilization of
fly ash slurry depends upon the extent of stabilization of silica
(SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) particles
because of the major contribution up to 54.6 and 32.8%, respectively.
The mechanism of stabilization can be explained either by a steric
or electrostatic factor.24 In our present
investigation, the zeta potential of slurry decreases from −29
to −13 mV at CMC of the dispersant, and the mechanism of stabilization
may be due to steric repulsion instead of electrostatic repulsion.
Due to a certain kind of specific interaction with silanol hydrogen,
the hydrophobic part of the dispersant is attached to the fly ash
surface and the hydrophilic sugar chain is hydrated, as shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively.
This type of interaction creates a steric barrier around each particle
and inhibits particle–particle association.24,29,36−38

with dispersants. (b) Schematic diagram of interaction between fly
ash particles with dispersants during transportation.

Comparative Cost Analysis with Commercial Dispersant
The cost of additive S. laurifolia fruits (Tables 1 and 2) used in the viscosity reduction of fly ash–water
slurry has been estimated by comparing its cost with well-known commercial
dispersants CTAB and SDS.13 From Figure 9a, the lowest viscosity
is observed at 0.325 × 10–3 g/cc CTAB concentration,
and no significant change in viscosity is observed with a further
increase in CTAB concentration. Similarly, from Figure 9b, the lowest viscosity is observed at 2.34
× 10–3 g/cc SDS concentration. Since the CMCs
of CTAB and SDS concentrations are 0.9 mM (0.328 × 10 –3 g/cc) and 8.2 mM (2.34 × 10–3 g/cc), respectively,39 the optimized concentration for pipeline transportation
may be their CMC.
From viscosity measurement and CMC results, the stabilizing effect
of 1 kg of CTAB is equivalent to 51.82 kg of S. laurifolia fruits. Thus, the estimated overall cost of the dispersant CTAB
is determined to be ∼3.6-fold in comparison to that of a S. laurifolia fruit. The cost of a S. laurifolia fruit is ∼0.72 U.S. dollars
per kilogram in India, whereas the CTAB (Merck, India) costs ∼186
U.S. dollars (per kg). Similarly, by comparing with SDS, 7.26 kg of S. laurifolia fruits has an equal stabilizing effect
on fly ash slurry with 1 kg of SDS.

Conclusions
The pipeline transportation of fly ash
from the thermal power plant to its destination site such as an ash
pond is an economical method with a minimum negative impact on the
environment by utilizing an aqueous extract of S. laurifolia, wisely replacing well-known commercial dispersants CTAB and SDS.
This natural dispersant stabilizes the fly ash slurry to the maximum
extent at 0.017 g/cc, which is the CMC. Wettability of fly ash slurry
is increased, which is confirmed from the reduction of the surface
tension value from 70.6 to 40 mN/m. The decreased value of the zeta
potential from −29 to −13 mV confirmed that the stabilization
mechanism is of a steric type instead of electrostatic repulsion.
The SEM image (Figure 10) of the air-dried slurry indicates that there may be agglomeration
of fly ash particles in the presence of the dispersant S. laurifolia.

presence of dispersants.

Materials and Methods

The fly ash sample was
procured from Jindal Steel, Chhattisgarh. The fly ash physical characteristic
properties are given in Table 3, and the chemical assay is summarized in Table 4. The particle size distribution
of the fly ash sample was measured by a particle size analyzer (Malvern,
Pvt. Ltd.), and its peak pattern is presented in Figure 11. The surface topography of

Preparation of Aqueous Extract of S. laurifolia
The additive S. laurifolia was collected from the Eastern sector forest of Odisha, India. Dry
fruits of S. laurifolia (10 g) were
taken, and the pericarp of the fruits was removed, dried, and powdered.
The pericarp of S. laurifolia was changed
to a powder form and then dissolved in a desired volume (100 mL) of
water. The aliquot was subjected to agitation for a duration of 3
h using a magnetic stirrer. Then, the supernatant solution obtained
was centrifuged (centrifuge, Eppendorf, Pvt. Ltd.) and filtered to
extract the active component as saponin into the corresponding aqueous
medium. This extract was utilized as the dispersant in the preparation
of fly ash–water slurry.

Surface Activity of the Aqueous Extract of S.
laurifolia
The surface tension of the aqueous
extract was measured using a surface tensiometer (Kyowa-350, Japan).
The varying trend of the surface tension of the aqueous phase is plotted
with depressant concentration, and results are shown in Figure 1. The trend shows a quick drop
of surface tension while increasing the depressant dose. The pure
water surface tension is 72 mN/m and gets saturated until a minimum
value of 40 mN/m, where the concentration of depressant reaches 0.017
g/cc (1.7 wt %).

Measurement of Surface Charge on Fly Ash Particles
The probe 24V (52–60 Hz) T3A attached to a microprocessor
was used in measuring the zeta potential for the fly ash slurry sample.
The condition of 10% S/L of fly ash with deionized water was maintained
and then subjected to stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min at a temperature
of 25 °C. Subsequently, 1 mL of the resulting sample was taken
for zeta potential analysis. Similarly, the zeta potential of fly
ash along with a dispersant sample was determined at varying doses
at the same conditions. Most of the experiments were investigated
in triplicate; furthermore, the mean values were considered and reported.

Measurement of Rheological Behavior
The rheology experimental
study for fly ash slurry was examined using a HAAKE RheoStress 1(Thermo
Scientific rheometer). For the test, the slurry was prepared by slowly
adding fly ash ranging from 50 to 65% by weight in distilled water
with continuous stirring of the mixture for 5 to 10 min. In this study,
∼30 mL of the slurry sample was introduced into a cleaned rheology
cup in which the temperature was maintained up to 30 °C. The
experiment was tested twice, and the average output data was further
analyzed. The relationship of shear stress and shear rate showed the
best fit to the Bingham plastic model.
