A graphene-like semiconductor composite is one of the
most promising
photocatalyst that does not use noble metals. These composites have
excellent photocatalytic properties and have attracted great attention
for water splitting. Here, a facile method called the hydrothermal
method was used to prepare graphene oxide (GO)/SiC/MoS2 composites. Under visible-light irradiation, the GO/SiC/MoS2 composite had excellent photocatalytic production of hydrogen
from water splitting. In particular, the catalyst added 8 wt % of
Mo weight yielded the highest quantum of 20.45% at 400–700
nm of wavelength. A positive synergistic effect between the layered
GO and MoS2 components contributed to the enhanced photoactivity
of the SiC particles. The synergistic effect reduced the recombination
of photogenerated holes and electrons, enhanced the rate of electron
transfer, and provided more reaction active sites for water splitting.
The interactions among SiC, GO, and MoS2 were investigated
using a density functional theory. The calculations showed that the
relative positions between graphene only slightly affect the stability
of the interface, and the MoS2 layers have a great influence.
The photocatalytic mechanism was also discussed, and electron transfer
was predicted.

Introduction
The use of sunlight for water splitting
is a method that can replace
fossil fuels and protect the environment.1−4 Presently, a number of semiconductor
materials, such as TiO25−7 and ZnO8,9 can be used for photocatalysis using ultraviolet light. Other semiconductor
materials, such as BiVO410,11 and CdS,12,13 can split water using visible light. However, these semiconductors
do not have high photocatalytic activities without a cocatalyst even
in the presence of the sacrificial chemical. The low activity is caused
by the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes before
they migrate to the surface for photocatalytic reaction. To retard
the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, metals, especially
noble metals, such as Pt14 and Au,15 are incorporated on the surface of semiconductors
to reduce hole–electron recombination. Semiconductor-based
photocatalysis is regarded as a green technology for environmental
remediation and solar energy conversion.16Chen

Silicon carbide (SiC)
belongs to the third generation of semiconductor
materials and has a suitable band gap (2.4–3.2 eV), large thermal
conductivity, and good chemical stability.17−19 SiC itself
does not produce hydrogen under visible light due to its high surface
energy. However, the position of the valence band and the conduction
band completely meet the requirements of photolysis water, that is,
the bottom position of the conduction band is negative compared with
the redox potential of H+/H2 and the position
of the top of the valence band is positive compared with the redox
potential of O2/H2O. In the field of photocatalysis,
SiC is regarded as the most promising photocatalytic material due
to its high photoreduction of conduction band electrons. Early in
2012, Hao et al.20 reported that the β-SiC
nanowires can absorb visible light and exhibit excellent photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution performance from pure water under visible-light
irradiation. Peng et al.21 further studied
the importance of heterojunctions in SiC/CdS composite photocatalytic
materials and found that lattice matching can increase hydrogen production.
Improving the photocatalytic efficiency of SiC remains a challenge.
Most recently, the use of nanosized noble metals, such as Au,22 to decorate SiC has been used to form a new
Fermi level equilibrium that inhibits the photogenerated electrons
and holes recombination. The adoption of noble metals and other substances,
such as Pt/SiC18 and SiC–CdLa2S4,23 significantly
improves the photocatalytic efficiency of SiC. However, the scarcity
of precious metals, high cost, and subsequent environmental pollution
hinder their widespread use. Therefore, the development of nonprecious
metals as efficient cocatalysts to promote the effective separation
of photogenerated electrons and holes is urgently needed.

As
a result, low-cost and highly efficient cocatalysts are needed
for photocatalytic hydrogen production. A typical layered transition-metal
sulfide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), with a structure
of three stacked atom layers (S–Mo–S) held together
by van der Waals forces, has attracted much attention for photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution.24,25 In addition, a layered transition
material such as MoS2 has proven to be an encouraging promoter
due to its rich active edge sites. Shi et al.26 reported that MoS2 as a cocatalyst of photocatalytic
H2 generation activity of g-C3N4 under
visible-light irradiation. They concluded that the emission of g-C3N4 is quenched by MoS2 nanodots more
effectively than by MoS2 monolayers. Graphene oxide (GO)
exhibits superior electron mobility and excellent electronic behavior.
Additionally, GO is an efficient cocatalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen
production reactions because of its high specific surface area and
good electron-transfer ability.27,28

However, to the
best of our knowledge, SiC powder photocatalyst
with layered GO/MoS2 has not been reported. Herein, we
report the fabrication of SiC particles loaded with a nanosized layer-structured
GO/MoS2 nanosheet. We used a facile hydrothermal method
and optimized MoS2 content in the GO/SiC/MoS2 photocatalyst. This catalyst provides abundant reactive sites for
hydrogen evolution and can increase the transport of charges and reduce
the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a result,
our GO/SiC/MoS2 photocatalyst exhibited significantly improved
photocatalytic activity for photocatalytic water splitting.

Results and Discussion
Structures and Morphologies of the Samples
The morphology
and microstructure of SGM-8 were characterized by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and the relevant results are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a,b shows the FESEM images of pure SiC and SGM-8, respectively. Figure S2a–c (in the Supporting Information
S4) shows the FESEM images of SGM-2, SGM-5, and SGM-10, respectively.
The GO and MoS2 modification effect on the pure SiC structure
is shown in Figures 1b and S2a–c. Sharper nanosheets
were obtained in all GO/SiC/MoS2 samples and seem to be
more disorganized than pure SiC. Sharper nanosheets can lead to more
exposed surfaces and active edges, which may contribute to the enhanced
photocatalytic hydrogen production performance.29 Energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), as shown in Figure 1c, determined the
elemental composition at (c) in Figure 1b. As depicted in Figure 1c, the presence of the elements of Si, C,
Mo, and S is validated for the SGM-8 photocatalyst. High-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) images of SGM-8 samples are shown in Figure 1d. Obviously, the lattice fringes
correspond to the interplanar distance of 0.25 and 0.27 nm, which
can be attributed to the (006) plane of the SiC phase and the (101)
plane of the MoS2 phase, respectively. This tight contact
enables stability and promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated
carriers between SiC, GO, and MoS2. This is definitely
beneficial for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.30 Further, the distribution of the three substances
in SGM-8, a TEM image, and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectrum were taken and are shown in Figure 3f. There are notable distributions of Si,
C, Mo, and S elements in the SGM-8 sample, indicating that the SGM-8
hybrid structure was successfully constructed. There was also a contact
surface between GO and MoS2. In the following density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, specific research will be conducted on
the influence of GO and MoS2 on the photocatalytic activity.

mapping images of the SGM-8 sample.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were
employed to further
confirm the crystal structure of the GO/SiC/MoS2 composites. Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern.
The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 34.097, 35.658, 38.136, 41.392,
45.294, 54.630, 60.010, 65.626, 70.856, 71.765, 73.358, and 75.520°
are attributed to the (101), (006), (103), (104), (105), (107), (110),
(109), (201), (116), (203), and (204) planes of a hexagonal structure
SiC and match well with those of 6H-SiC (No.72-0018).
The XRD patterns of the GO/SiC/MoS2 composites show that
it has a similar structure to pure SiC, suggesting that the hydrothermal
process has no significant influence on the crystal structure of SiC.
The GO peaks were not observed since the content of graphene in the
catalysts is low. SiC combined with GO and MoS2 has stronger
diffraction peaks than SiC. The addition of GO and MoS2 promoted the growth of SiC crystals. Good crystallization will reduce
defects of semiconductor photocatalysis, which is beneficial to the
transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes in and between the
lattices, thus improving the activity of photocatalyst. In comparison,
as the MoS2 loading increased, the intensity of the characteristic
peaks in the sample is strong first and then weaker. Additionally,
the intensity of the characteristic peaks of SGM-8 is the strongest.
The XRD result is in good agreement with the SEM and TEM results,
suggesting a new photocatalytic alternative to SiC.

of pure SiC and GO/SiC/MoS2 composites.

The textural properties of the prepared samples
were analyzed by
nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments. Figure 3 presents the adsorption–desorption isotherms of nitrogen
and the corresponding pore size distribution curves (the inset) for
pure SiC, SGM-2, SGM-5, SGM-8, and SGM-10. These isotherms show a
typical IV adsorption–desorption isotherm according to the
IUPAC classification, indicating the presence of mesopores. According
to the BDDT adsorption isotherm classification, the composite material
has a small change in SGM-2, as an H3 type-shape hysteresis loop in
the P/P0 range of 500–750
mmHg with no saturated adsorption till P/P0 = 800 mmHg, suggesting the presence of mesopores.31 This can be attributed to the interaction of
SiC with MoS2 and GO. The pore-size distributions of the
samples (inset of Figure 3) indicate a large number of pores centered at approximately
45.2, 38.3, 33.5, 32.6, and 37.1 nm for the pure SiC, SGM-2, SGM-5,
SGM-8, and SGM-10 samples, respectively. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface areas obtained from the desorption of branches
are presented in Table S1 (in the Supporting
Information S5) as the average results of two repeated measurements
with an error bar for each case. The average specific surface areas
were 0.40, 0.97, 2.57, 3.73, and 2.67 m2·g–1 for the pure SiC, SGM-2, SGM-5, SGM-8, and SGM-10 samples, respectively.
Combined with the SEM results, GO, and MoS2 could change
the morphology of SiC. Notably, a large surface area contributes more
reaction sites during the photocatalytic reaction process, which is
beneficial for increasing the activity of the photocatalytic reaction.31

SiC, SGM-2,
SGM-5, SGM-8, and SGM-10. The inset indicates their pore size distribution
curves.

Optical Absorptive Performance
The optical properties
of the GO/SiC/MoS2 composites were investigated using UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Figure 4a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra
of the pure SiC and GO/SiC/MoS2 composites. Compared with
the pure SiC UV–vis DRS, the other samples show enhanced photoabsorption
in the wavelength range from 370 to 770 nm caused by the strong photoabsorption
of the MoS2/GO, and the degree of red shift is similar
in SGM-8 and SGM-10. This was mainly because of their narrow band
gap and deep color, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic activity.32 The light absorption edge in the visible-light
region indicates that the GO/SiC/MoS2 composites have a
better response to the visible light. The band gap energy of synthesized
composites plays an important role in deciding the photocatalytic
activity of the photocatalyst. The band gaps of pure SiC and GO/SiC/MoS2 composites were calculated by extrapolating the linear part
of the (Ahν)2 versus energy (hν) function (where A = absorbance, h = Planck’s constant, and ν = frequency) as
shown in the inset of Figure 4b. The so-called Tauc plots are derived by using the Kubelka–Munk
method.33 The corresponding band gap energies
calculated based on Tauc plots are 2.91, 2.73, and 2.61 eV for SGM-2,
SGM-5, and SGM-8, respectively. The obtained band gap of SGM-10 is
similar to that of SGM-8. For the composites, the obtained band gap
of pure SiC (≈3.02 eV) is greater than those of the photocatalytic
samples.

(b) Corresponding Tauc plots.

Interaction among SiC, GO, and MoS2
X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results of SGM-8 and SGM-10 are shown
in Figure 5. Generally,
the Si 2p peaks at the binding energy (BE) of 100.8 and 102.1 eV are
attributed to the Si–C and Si–O bonds, respectively,
of which the C 1s peak BE values are 282.9 and 284.7 eV for the C–Si
and C–C bonds. In the comparison of SGM-10, the peak intensity,
Si–C and Si–O bonds area of SGM-8 decrease. However,
from the C 1s peak, there are no C–Si bonds in the SGM-10 sample
because of inorganic C pollution. As shown in Figure 5e,f, the fitted S peaks for the S 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 orbitals are located at 161.3 and
163.3 eV and are S2–.34 The Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 peaks are located
at 229.3 and 232.5 eV, respectively,24,35 and these
two fitted peaks represent the presence of Mo4+. The fitted
peak at 226.3 represents the 2s orbital interaction of Mo with S.
The fitted peaks at 233.1 and 230.6 eV represent the presence of Mo5+. The fitted peak at 235.7 eV represents the presence of
Mo6+ (Figure 5g,h).36 Compared with the SGM-8 sample,
too many Mo chemical states appeared in the SGM-10 sample. The presence
of MoS2 and other new substances caused chemical changes
during the hydrothermal reaction.

Photocatalytic Activity and Stability
Photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution activities of SGM-2, SGM-5, SGM-8, and SGM-10 were
evaluated under visible-light irradiation (400–700 nm) in a
mixed aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O and 0.1 M Na2SO3. The photocatalytic
hydrogen production activities of the samples were measured and compared
in Figure 6. Figure 6a shows the hydrogen
evolution result of 0.5 g of SGM-2, SGM-5, SGM-8, and SGM-10 under
4 h illumination of simulated sunlight, with pure SiC for comparison.
Pure SiC has no potential for hydrogen production due to its high
surface potential. The samples of SGM-2, SGM-5, SGM-8, and SGM-10
showed the hydrogen evolution of 2.7054, 2.7538, 4.2721, 2.8265, 3.3673,
and 2.2922 mL, respectively. The sample of MG has no photocatalytic
hydrogen production. This is because the position of the conduction
band does not meet the requirements of photocatalytic hydrogen production. Figure 6b shows the rate
of H2 evolution of samples with GO/SiC/MoS2 composites.
Only low hydrogen was detected when MoS2 alone was employed
as a photocatalyst (47 μmol·h–1·g–1) under the same experimental conditions.37 This indicates that SiC is the predominant active
component for photocatalytic H2 evolution in the nanocomposites.
The catalyst of SGM-2, SGM-5, SGM-8, SGM-10, SM, and SG gave a rate
of 27.60, 28.10, 43.59, 28.84, 34.36, and 23.38 μmol·h–1, respectively. The QY400–700 on
the SGM-8 catalyst could reach up to 20.45%. The result shows that
the introduction of MoS2 led to a significant enhancement
in photocatalytic hydrogen production. We speculate that the ratio
of MoS2 and GO is very important for the hydrogen generation
rate. A small amount of MoS2 and GO is not enough to improve
the charge-carrier separation and transfer, while much MoS2 may lead to the aggregation of SiC, and this is responsible for
a lower photocatalytic performance.

Furthermore, to evaluate the stability of photocatalysts,
we conducted
the cycling tests of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by repeatedly
using the same catalyst three times (as shown in Figure 6c–f). After three consecutive
experiments, the SGM-8 composite still showed high photocatalytic
activity, indicating better stability. The average hydrogen generation
evolution of SGM-8 was approximately 4.2721 mL, which is greater than
that of other composites, indicating that the appropriate addition
of MoS2 is expected to make the charge separation suppress
the electron–hole recombination, as well as enhance the photocatalytic
performance. Therefore, this SGM-8 photocatalytic material is a promising
catalyst with high efficiency and low cost for the H2 evolution
reaction.

Interfacial Interactions of DFT Calculations for the Formation
of the GO/SiC/MoS2 Composite
The density functional
theory (DFT) method was used to predict the possible active sites
of GO–SiC–MoS2 to understand the formation
mechanisms. After relaxation, all of the atomic layers were only slightly
distorted due to the weak bonding interactions between them. To evaluate
the adhesion strength between films in the interface systems, the
adhesion work (Wad) was calculated according
to eq 1 1  Eall is the total
energy of the interface and A is the area of the
interface. Egraphene, ESiC, and EMoS2 denote
the total energy of the isolated graphene, SiC slab, and the MoS2 slab, respectively. Based on the calculated work of adhesion
shown in Figure 7,
all of the studied systems show a weak adhesion between the films.
The I-a and I-b interface systems show the smallest work of adhesion,
indicating that graphene and SiC both prefer to interact with MoS2. The I-a and I-b interface systems show a nearly similar
work of adhesion, indicating that the relative positions between graphene
only slightly affects the stability of the interface system, while
the MoS2 layers have great influence.

Figure 7 Work of adhesion for
the interface systems.

Electronic Structures
The densities of states (DOS)
of photocatalytic material systems are calculated to study the interaction
mechanisms between films of the interface systems. According to the
work of adhesion, the relative positions of graphene show a weak influence
on the stability of the interface systems. Therefore, only the DOSs
of the I-a system are studied. Figure 8 shows the DOSs of the I-a system.

Figure 8 Density of states of
the I-a system: (a) relaxed structure and
(b) DOSs.

For the total DOSs of interface systems, a small
band gap is observed
below the Fermi energy level, which is mainly caused by an interaction
between films. There are few overlaps between the C1 and S1 orbitals,
indicating the weak interactions between them. S2 and Si1 show strong
interactions in the energy region of −7.5 and −2.0 eV.
Therefore, the interactions between SiC and MoS2 are much
stronger than those between graphene and MoS2.

The
plane-averaged charge (PAC) distributions of the interface
systems are evaluated to investigate the charge transfer near the
interface. The PAC describes the charge distributions on a specific
plane along a particular direction. The difference of PACs between
the interface and separated graphene, MoS2, and SiC are
plotted in Figure 9, which will help to describe the charge-transfer mechanisms between
the films. The positive and negative values denote the increase and
decrease in charge after the formation of the interface, respectively.
The PAC difference is mainly distributed in the region of 7.5 and
12.5 Å. The peak zone of approximately 11 Å is the MoS2 and SiC interfacial zone of the interface. The PAC distributions
between the graphene and MoS2 interface changed only slightly,
indicating weak interactions between them, which is consistent with
the above results from the work of adhesion and DOSs.

Figure 9 PAC difference of interface
system.

Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism of the GO/SiC/MoS2 Composite
Active components, such as h+, e–, and H+, produced in the photocatalytic
water splitting to hydrogen, were closely related to the photocatalytic
activity of the GO/SiC/MoS2 composite. As a good two-dimensional
graphene-like material, such as GO and MoS2, the composite
can enhance the conductivity of the photocatalytic materials and facilitate
good charge transfer. A tentative mechanism proposed for the high
H2 production activity of the GO/SiC/MoS2 composite
is illustrated in Figure 10. Under visible light, the photogenerated electrons of SiC
are excited and transferred to the surface. Some of the electrons
approaching MoS2 directly reacted with adsorbed H+ in H2O to produce H2 from the catalytic activity
of the unsaturated active S atoms, which can accept electrons and
act as active sites for H2 generation. At the interface
between GO and MoS2, the catalytic activity is weak. Part
of the electrons of SiC can be transferred to MoS2 through
graphene, and hydrogen is generated by reaction with H+ under visible-light irradiation.

Figure 10 Schematic illustration of the photocatalytic
mechanism in the GO/SiC/MoS2 composite.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All chemicals except SiC were analytical
grade and used as received without further purification. See S1 (in the Supporting Information) for more information
on all chemicals.

Synthesis of SiC/GO/MoS2 Composites
See S2 (in the Supporting Information) for the preparation
of pure SiC. The process for preparing SiC/GO/MoS2 composites
is illustrated in Figure 11. The loading weight percent of Mo was 2.0 wt % based on the
total cocatalyst and SiC mass. The GO/SiC/MoS2 composites
were prepared by a simple hydrothermal synthesis. The GO/SiC/MoS2 composites were prepared as follows: 0.1741 g of MoS2 was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water too. Then, 0.05
g of GO and 5.0 g of pure SiC particles were added to the solution
and then ultrasonicated for 4 h (25 W L–1 and a
frequency of 40 KHz at room temperature). Two drops of ionic liquid
([BMIM]PF6), was added to the suspension and stirred for
6 h. Then, the mixed suspension was transferred into a 300 mL Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave and stored in an oven at 200 °C for
20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was washed
and centrifuged with deionized water until the pH reached 7. The samples
were then dried (vacuum) at 60 °C overnight. The resulting products
are denoted as SGM-2, indicating an added weight percent of 2 wt %
Mo. SiC and GO with MoS2 (wt %) alone are respectively
denoted as SGM-x (x = 2, 5, 8, 10).
Based on the best composite photocatalyst, we prepared comparative
samples. SiC/MoS2, SiC/GO, and MoS2/GO were
fabricated in the same condition. These samples are denoted as SM,
SG, and MG, respectively.

Figure 11 Schematic representation of the synthesis of
the SiC/GO/MoS2 composite photocatalysts.

Characterization of the Prepared Photocatalysts
The
morphology of the products was examined using a field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM, TESCAN VEGA II). Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were acquired
on a JEOL-2100 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200
kV. The crystal phases of the samples were determined using an X-ray
powder diffractometer (XRD) with a Ultima IV diffraction meter (Rigaku,
Japan) and Cu Kα radiation source. We scanned the sample for
the range of 30–80° at a scanning rate of 4° min–1. The BET surface area was determined from nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms using a Micromeritics ASAP
2460. The optical absorption property of the samples was measured
by a UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS, UH4150,
Hitachi) with BaSO4 as the reflectance standard. Further
evidence for the composition of the product was recorded from X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using an Al Kα radiation.

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production Activity
The water-splitting
reactor is shown in Figure S1 (in the Supporting
Information S3). Prior to the photocatalytic reaction, 0.5 g of the
photocatalyst was dispersed into 100 mL of distilled water with 0.1
M Na2S·9H2O and Na2SO3, which have been proved to be one of the most effective electron
donors for water-splitting reactions.38 The solution was maintained at pH 7. After passing N2 for 30 min to remove the dissolved oxygen, the N2 valve
was closed. Under continuous stirring of 400 rpm, the system was irradiated
with a Xe lamp (400–700 nm). A specific amount of the produced
gas was collected, and the hydrogen content was analyzed using gas
chromatography (GC-9790 II, TCD) with argon as the carrier gas. The
photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated by the rate of
H2 evolution in 4 h.

The photocatalytic H2 production rate is calculated via eq 2 2  where rm is the
H2 production rate (μmol·g–1·h–1) and n is moles of H2 evolved in 4 h (μmol). The calculated H2 concentration was measured with GC through a standard curve; t is
the duration of the photocatalytic reaction (h); and m is the mass dose of photocatalyst (g). The QY defined with the following eqs 3–639,40 was measured using a band-pass interference
filter (λ = 400–700 nm, Edmund Optics) and the spectroradiometer 3   4   5   6  where S is the cross-sectional
area of the reactor (cm2); N is the number
of incident photons (einsteins·s–1); R is the irradiance at a given wavelength (einstein cm–2·s–1·nm–1), when the wavelength is 400–700 nm, R =
2 × 10–2; I is the light intensity
(einstein cm–2·s–1); λ
is the irradiation wavelength (nm), and λ1 and λ2 are the lower and upper limits of the irradiation wavelengths,
respectively; r is the H2 production rate
(μmol·h–1); and n is
the moles of H2 evolved per 4 h time (μmol).

Calculation Methods
The total energy and electronic
structure of all catalysts were calculated using DFT via VASP code
with projector-augmented wave Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
pseudopotential.41−43 Various interfacial systems were constructed.44 The energy cutoff of the plane-wave basis was
set to 450 eV, and only the γ point was used for the relaxations
of the interfacial systems because we had a large supercell. The DFT-D3
method was used to consider the van der Waals interactions between
films. To simulate the interactions between graphene, MoS2, and SiC, all the atoms in graphene and MoS2 slabs were
relaxed, and the two bottom Si–C layers were fixed to simulate
the bulk SiC systems. The simulation models are shown in Figure 12. Single graphene
and MoS2 layers, four SiC layers, and a 1.5 nm vacuum layer
comprise the models. Eight interface models with different terminations
were considered to study the interactions between graphene MoS2 and SiC.

Conclusions
A novel GO/MoS2 hybrid structure
decorated with SiC
particles was synthesized by a facile one-step soft hydrothermal process
using a green photocatalyst for solar energy production of hydrogen.
The as-prepared GO/SiC/MoS2 composite photocatalysts show
a highly enhanced photocatalytic activity for the solar energy production
of hydrogen as compared to that of the pure SiC photocatalyst. By
optimizing the loadings of MoS2, the GO/SiC/MoS2 composite showed the highest photocatalytic H2 production
activity when the content of the MoS2 catalyst was 8.0
wt % with a small amount of graphene. The calculation results of DFT
and the experimental results indicated that the interactions between
SiC and MoS2 are much stronger than those between graphene
and MoS2. It is believed that the interfacial photocatalytic
activity between GO and MoS2 in the GO/SiC/MoS2 composite is believed to be small. The incorporation of graphene
enhances the charge-transfer abilities and retards the recombination
of the photogenerated carrier, improving the photocatalytic H2 production activities. Therefore, noble-metal-free GO/SiC/MoS2 composite photocatalyst has the potential for H2 production under visible-light irradiation.
