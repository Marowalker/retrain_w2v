Directed
alignment of polymer chains plays an indispensable role
in charge transport properties. We focus not only on a specific method
to induce the alignment but also on the design of a liquid crystalline
(LC) conjugated polymer to take advantage of an intrinsic self-assembly
characteristic. We synthesized a lyotropic LC conjugated polymer,
CP1-P, having o-nitrobenzyl (ONB) esters as photocleavable
side chains and adopted a floating film transfer method to induce
the polymer chain alignment through a lyotropic LC phase transition.
An optimum amount of a high boiling point solvent (1,2-dichlorobenzene)
in chloroform turned out to be an important factor to maximize the
polymer chain alignment. The hole transport mobility along the polymer
chain alignment direction was 13–14 times higher than that
in the direction perpendicular to the alignment. In addition, the
removal of side chains resulted in the solvent resistivity while maintaining
the alignment feature in organic thin-film transistors.

Introduction
Liquid crystalline
(LC) conjugated polymers (CPs) combine benefits
from both LC and CP properties. In other words, they not only possess
the unique LC features of self-assembly and molecular alignment by
external treatments but also show flexibility, solution processability,
and structure tunability from the molecular design of CPs. A combination
of these properties offers significant advantages for the development
of highly aligned polymer films promoting efficient charge transport
characteristics in organic electronics.1−4 Sirringhaus et al. reported that enhanced
mobilities were achieved in poly-9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-bithiophene (F8T2) by aligning polymer chains parallel to the charge
transport direction.5 Another LC polyfluorene,
(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT),
showed mobility anisotropies of 10–15 and 5–7 for hole
and electron transport, respectively, when the conjugated backbones
were aligned along the direction of nanolines formed by a nanoimprinting
process.6 We also reported LC CP design
rules and demonstrated a hole mobility of 0.86 cm2/Vs along
the polymer alignment direction that is 1600 times faster than that
perpendicular to the polymer alignment.7 Recently, Bridge and co-workers presented that different intermolecular
interactions of lyotropic cyclopentadithiophene-based polymers contributed
to the formation of macroscopically aligned polymer films by varying
flexible side chains.8

Although many
previous studies elaborated distinct advantages of
LC that lead to a charge transport anisotropy in polymer films,5,6,9 the structural diversity remains
a challenge because of the lack of systematic analysis on correlations
between the molecular structure and LC behavior of CPs. In this work,
a newly designed LC CP, poly(bis(5-(dodecyloxy)-2-nitrobenzyl) 1-(5-(2,5-difluoro-4-(thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophene-5,5(6H)-dicarboxylate) (CP1-P), is being synthesized (Scheme 1). Specifically, this polymer
has o-nitrobenzyl (ONB) ester side chain, which is
one of the most commonly used photocleavable moieties,10−12 but has not been widely applied for lyotropic LC CPs. We confirmed
that the polymer forms typical schlieren-like texture at a highly
concentrated LC phase. This proves comparability of the photocleavable
side chains with our previously reported design rule for LC CPs.7 Because of its LC character, the polymer showed
a unique intermolecular interaction leading to a uniaxial alignment
during the film formation process by the floating film transfer method
(FTM).13−15 This method was first reported with poly(3-hexylthiophene)
by Morita et al.16 It is similar to the
Langmuir–Schaefer technique except that controlling a surface-pressure
to make a compact film is not required. To be specific, a small drop
of hydrophobic polymer solution is put on the surface of subphase
hydrophilic liquid and spread out rapidly over the liquid followed
by a thin and uniform film formation. Several factors, such as temperature
and viscosity of the hydrophilic liquid, solvent, and backbone structure,
affecting this film formation process have been investigated.17−19 Very recently, a modified FTM with a customized slider to provide
a directional force has been also introduced using poly(3,3‴-didodecyl-quaterthiophene)
(PQT-12), which is one of the widely studied polymers as the charge
transporting layer in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs).15

We found an interesting new phenomenon in the
solvent composition
for FTM. Although it has been shown that using a high boiling point
(BP) solvent induces strong self-assembly and large crystalline grains
of polymer chains,20,21 the complete replacement of a
low BP solvent with a high BP solvent resulted in negative impact
on the polymer chain alignment in FTM.18 Instead, we systematically controlled the solvent composition by
using a high BP solvent as an additive to provide adequate time for
polymer chains to self-assemble while maintaining a low BP solvent
as the primary solvent for CPs to undergo lyotropic LC phase transition.
The precisely controlled amount of high BP solvent brings about a
slow evaporation and uniform morphology without losing the alignment
feature. This produces remarkably enhanced optical anisotropy and
charge-carrier mobility compared to the case of polymer solutions
without containing any high BP solvent. Moreover, the polymer chain
alignment was essentially maintained after cleavage of ONB side chains,
yielding solvent resistance, which can be useful for a solution-based
multilayer processing in organic electronics.

Results and Discussion
An LC CP bearing photocleavable side chains (CP1-P) has been synthesized
(Schemes 1 and S1). Our group reported previously a molecular
design principle of lyotropic LC CPs, which states the following three
points: (1) the interaction between sulfur and fluorine atoms, which
is weak enough not to induce interpolymer aggregation, but will make
chain planarization in a highly concentrated regime only; (2) introducing
two bulky side chains to prevent interdigitation of the side chains
between lamellar layers; (3) the tetrahedral carbon to minimize undesired
massive interpolymer aggregation.7 A more
detailed study to verify that three rules are not limited to a certain
building block is being currently explored. Together with the investigation
on universal applicability of different building blocks in polymer
main chains, we have been interested in modification on side chains
without sacrificing LC properties. Even if incorporating side chains
to CPs is a common strategy to make the polymers solution processable
for OTFTs, the side chains do not contribute to charge transport properties
because they are electrically insulating. For this reason, we assumed
that removing side chains after a film formation might be beneficial
for a more efficient charge transport. We chose ONB esters as photocleavable
side chains not only because of their photo responsivity but also
because of their bulkiness to provide sufficient solubility before
the cleavage. The detailed synthetic process for the polymer is described
in the Supporting Information.

The
absorption profiles of CP1-P in solution and the solid state
were almost identical, indicating that the polymer has a similar structural
order in solution as in the film state (Figure S1). To remove the photo-labile ONB side chains, the spin-casted
films on glass substrates were irradiated with UV light (365 nm).
UV irradiation resulted in side chain cleavage and after chloroform
(CF) rinsing, the absorbance intensity and absorption maxima of the
conjugated polymer film remained intact because of the removal of
the solubilizing side chains (Figure 1). The nonirradiated third layer having ONB side chains
was completely removed by the same CF rinsing as shown in Figure 1a. The cleavage of
side chains clearly displayed that it makes the polymers insoluble,
enabling the deposition of consecutive layers from the same solvent
without disrupting the bottom layers. Continuously, optical anisotropy
of films prepared by another film formation method, FTM, was investigated
(Figure 2). A uniaxial
alignment of polymer chains perpendicular to the radial direction
in a spreading polymer droplet on subphase liquid is induced by this
method. The dichroic ratio (DR), defined as DR = Aparallel/Aperpendicular, where Aparallel is the maximum absorbance of polarized
light parallel to the alignment direction and Aperpendicular is the maximum absorbance of polarized light
perpendicular to the alignment direction, was calculated at 573 nm.
The calculated DR of 4.8 under optimum conditions gives a clear evidence
of the uniaxially aligned polymer chains. In addition to the DR value
reflecting the absorbance intensity difference depending on the polarized
light, it is worth mentioning that the absorption maximum is red-shifted
by 5 nm for CP1-P, when films are prepared by the FTM compared to
that of the film by spin-casting (Figures 2a and S1). The
absorption of longer wavelength together with much stronger main peak
(565–575 nm) intensity compared to the second peak (520–530
nm) can be attributed to enhanced intermolecular packing because of
the alignment.19,22

(S, the blue solid sphere) as a function of CF-DCB
blend ratios. The error bars represent the standard deviation. All
films were formed by FTM on the subphase liquid of ethylene glycol–glycerol
blend (1:1 v/v).

The effect of solvent
composition for the polymer solution and
hydrophilic subphase liquid (ethylene glycol–glycerol blends)
on the DR values is presented in Figures 2b and S2. Also,
the order parameters (S), defined as S = (DR – 1)/(DR + 1), where DR is the dichroic ratio, were
calculated for each solvent composition.23,24 Complete alignment should exhibit S = 1 and no
preferential orientation corresponds to S = 0. The
optimum blending ratio of hydrophilic liquid was found to be 1:1 (ethylene
glycol/glycerol v/v). When the amount of glycerol is smaller than
ethylene glycol, the spreading speed of the polymer droplet was too
fast so that the resulted film tended to be torn apart before it solidified
into a uniformly aligned thin film. On the other hand, when the mixture
contained more glycerol than ethylene glycol, the solution dried even
before the polymer droplet formed a thin film. This is because the
high viscosity of glycerol hampers the mobility of the polymer on
it. In case of solvent composition to prepare polymer solutions, we
compared four different conditions; CF only and CF containing small
amounts of the high BP solvent 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) with different
volume ratios (CF/DCB 99:1, 97:3, and 95:5). The use of a high BP
solvent is one common approach to improve device performance by providing
enough time for self-assembly of CPs. However, it has been described
that the FTM polymer films from a high BP solvent tend to have a random
macromolecular arrangement unlike the films from a low BP solvent
because the choice of solvent affects the balance between the solvent
evaporation and the spreading speeds in the process.18 Instead, we used only a small volume of the high BP solvent
as an additive not as the primary solvent so that we can take advantage
of relatively slower evaporation and uniform morphology without sacrificing
the alignment feature of FTM.20 When we
added 1 vol % of DCB, a slight improvement in terms of alignment was
noticed, whereas when 5 vol % was added, we observed no significant
alignment, which is similar to the CF-only case. A schematic illustration
of the differences in the alignment during the film formation process
is shown in Figure 3a. We speculated that if we had too much DCB, the polymer solution
would spread out all over the surface without forming a highly concentrated
region because of its high BP so that we could not induce an efficient
lyotropic LC property of CP1-P. We experienced when we used 3 vol
% of DCB, the solvent composition provided enough time for close packing
and self-assembly of polymer chains. By having this optimum blending
ratio of DCB and CF, the remaining 97 vol % of CF still allows relatively
fast drying to form a highly concentrated region, resulting in lyotropic
LC phase transition. Thus, the alignment can be the most efficient.
The degree of alignment quantified by DR was improved by almost three
times as we added the high BP solvent through the formation of a more
ordered structural alignment. As anticipated, charge transport properties
follow the same trend: the mobility of the device when polymer chains
are parallel to the source–drain electrodes increases four
times because of the high BP solvent effect during the film formation
process (Figure S3).

microscopy images of a highly concentrated (top, ∼200 mg/mL)
and a diluted (bottom, <50 mg/mL) CP1-P solution under a crossed
polarizer. The white scale bars represent 10 μm.

The lyotropic LC properties of the polymer were
identified by a
cross-polarized optical microscope. As shown in Figure 3b, the polymer displayed the schlieren texture,
which is commonly observed in LC mesophases, only at a highly concentrated
regime.25 This lyotropic LC behavior is
an important characteristic leading to alignment properties with potentially
high charge-carrier transport.7 To investigate
the effect of the polymer chain alignment from the lyotropic LC CPs,
we fabricated OTFTs in the bottom-gate and top-contact configuration.
The aligned polymer films were transferred from the hydrophilic liquid
surface (ethylene glycol–glycerol 1:1 blend) to the octadecyltrichlorosilane
(OTS)- treated substrate by stamping. The samples were then rinsed
with isopropyl alcohol to remove the remaining liquid. The best charge
transport performance was observed from the devices postannealed at
200 °C. The thermal gravimetric analysis shows that CP1-P is
thermally stable up to 250 °C (Figure S4). In order to explore charge transport anisotropy, the source–drain
electrodes were deposited in two different directions (channel angles
of 0° and 90° relative to the alignment direction of polymer
chains). As a control, spin-cast films were also prepared in the same
device geometry (Figure S5). In comparison
to the device when source–drain electrode is deposited perpendicularly
(⊥), the device with parallel direction (//) is responsible
for its higher hole mobilities by more than an order of magnitude
from 8.73 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 (μ⊥) to 1.21 ×
10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 (μ//) (Figure 4). The primary reason for this mobility anisotropy
is due to a substantial difference in charge-transport pathways, which
are determined by the orientation of the polymer chain alignment relative
to the source–drain electrodes direction. In other words, in
a parallel device, a charge carrier can travel mainly along the polymer
chains, whereas it should move by hopping through π–π
stacks in a perpendicular device.26 As
anticipated, the devices prepared by spin-coating, which have no anisotropic
orientation, showed their hole mobility values (μiso) between μ⊥ and μ// of
the device with aligned CP1-P. Additionally, the effect of side chain
removal followed by solvent rinsing on the device performance was
investigated. Although a ∼1.3-fold decrease in mobility was
observed upon the side chain cleavage and rinsing process, the device
still exhibited superior hole transporting property over randomly
oriented devices. This suggests that the alignment feature has been
only slightly disturbed after exposure to UV and organic solvent (CF).
The maximum mobility values for each condition with an average mobility,
on/off ratio, and threshold voltage are summarized in Table 1. Even though the overall trend
matches well with the result predicted by an anisotropic orientation,
the difference between the spin-coated film and the aligned film was
relatively small compared to our previous data.7 A plausible explanation for this result is that bulky aromatic
rings in the side chains are likely to hinder more efficient alignment
and close packing during the film formation process.27 As discussed above in the optical property analysis, when
the polarized light is perpendicular to the alignment direction, the
absorbance is not zero, indicating less-effective polymer alignment.

values were measured under
a nitrogen atmosphere. The maximum values are listed in parentheses.

The surface morphology of the
films formed by spin-casting and
FTM before and after the removal of side chains was investigated by
tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure S6). The root-mean-square roughness values for the spin-cast
film was 1.11 nm and that for the FTM films before and after the cleavage
were 1.59, 1.47 nm, respectively. It should be noted that the film
morphology after the side chain cleavage is comparable with the one
before the cleavage reaction. This substantiates that the side chain
removal process involving the treatment of the organic solvent does
not disrupt the morphology of the polymer films because of the excellent
solvent resistance. Inappreciable polymer alignments from AFM images
can be understood considering that AFM is used to analyze the surface
topography of samples rather than the chain alignment in bulk.28

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was
conducted to analyze preferential
orientation (i.e. edge-on or face-on) and crystallinity of FTM films
before and after the side chain cleavage (Figure S7 and Table S1). The absence of
the (010) peak corresponding to the interchain π–π
stacking and the discernible (100) peak representing lamellar packing
of FTM films in the out-of-plane direction suggest dominant edge-on
orientation of the polymer chains. The peak positions for both parallel
and perpendicular directions were observed at 2θ = 3.98°
(d = 22.2 Å), indicating no anisotropic orientation
in the out-of-plane direction. Unexpectedly, the lamellar packing
distance showed almost no change after removing the bulky side chains.
This observation could be explained by insufficient mobility of the
rigid polymer chains in the solid state. While the location of the
lamellar peak was almost identical, it is also worthy of note that
the lamellar packing peak became broader [full-width at half-maximum
(fwhm) = 0.56] than that of the film before cleavage (fwhm = 0.40)
because of a slightly disturbed packing. The XRD results are consistent
with the slightly decreased transistor performance.

Conclusions
We report a lyotropic LC CP with photocleavable side chains and
their uniaxial alignment via the FTM. The lyotropic LC behavior leads
to the uniaxial orientation of polymer chains and the photolabile
side chains render solvent resistance of the polymer and multilayer
fabrication capability. The optical and electrical anisotropies achieved
by the floating film transfer have been explored through optical spectra
and field effect transistors. The effect of solvent composition and
subphase liquid composition on the polymer alignment was systematically
investigated. The small amount of high BP solvent as an additive,
which was added into the polymer solution prior to the film formation
process, largely enhances the polymer alignment by providing ample
time for close packing and self-assembly of the polymer. The average
charge-carrier mobility anisotropy (μ∥/μ⊥) in the optimized condition was found to be 13.86,
emphasizing the importance of controlling solvent composition to maximize
the degree of alignment. The hole mobility of CP1-P after the side
chain cleavage decreased from 1.21 × 10–2 cm2 V–1 s–1 to 9.34 ×
10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1, but was still significantly larger than the devices
having perpendicular (8.73 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1) or spin-cast random
orientation (2.56 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1) before cleavage. This indicates
that the alignment has been preserved during the process of rinsing
with CF, which is a good solvent for CP1-P. Our results demonstrate
that rod-like LC CPs having photocleavable side chains are promising
for various flexible organic electronics as highly aligned and solvent-resistant
semiconducting materials. Rational functionalization on the carboxylic
acid, which was obtained as the result of side chain cleavage, will
enable wider range of applications for organic electronics such as
potentiometric sensors.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
reagents were acquired from commercial
suppliers [Aldrich or Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (TCI)] and
used without any further purification. ((2,5-Difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(trimethylstannane)
was prepared according to the reported procedures.7 The synthetic procedure used to prepare the monomer with
cleavable side chains is shown in Scheme 1, and the details are presented in the Supporting Information.

Instrumentation
Molecular weights were determined by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in CF against polystyrene standards
using a Waters 515 HPLC Pump equipped with a Waters 2410 refractive
index detector and three Waters styragel columns (flow rate: 1.0 mL/min).
NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ultrashield 400 MHz or Bruker
AVANCE 600 MHz spectrometers in CDCl3 at 298 K. Absorption
spectra were measured using a Cary 50 Bio UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Varian). UV light irradiation was performed using a 365 nm LED lamp
with a power density of 25 mW cm–2. AFM images were
recorded on an Asylum Research MFP-3D stand-alone AFM in the tapping
mode with a CT300-25 Aspire probe (spring constant 40 N/m and radius
of curvature of 8 nm). Out-of-plane XRD patterns were collected using
a Rigaku Ultima III diffractometer system with graphite monochromatized
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 48 kV and 40 mA.

Multilayer Film Formation
Multilayer films were prepared
with repetitive spin-casting, followed by UV irradiation and rinsing
with CF, for each of the first two layers. The photocleavage of side
chains gave good solvent resistance to the resulting film. The subsequent
spin-casting on top of the insoluble first (second) layer produced
the second (third) layer.

Device Fabrication and Characterization
Top-contact,
bottom-gate thin film transistors were fabricated on heavily n-doped
silicon wafers with a 300 nm thick thermally grown SiO2 as the gate dielectric (capacitance 10 nF cm–2). The substrates were cleaned by sonication in detergent and deionized
water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, followed by a UV–ozone
treatment for 20 min. The surface of the cleaned silicon substrates
was treated with 0.1 M OTS in toluene at 60 °C for 30 min followed
by rinsing with toluene and isopropyl alcohol. The polymer film was
prepared either by spin-casting at 1000 rpm under a nitrogen environment
or by FTM under ambient conditions, from 0.4 wt % solution in CF and
0.3 wt % solution in CF containing 0–5 vol % DCB, respectively.
Subsequently, the devices made by FTM were annealed at 80 °C
for 3 min to remove any residual solvent. Au source–drain electrodes
were deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask (L = 100 μm, W = 500 μm). Electrical
characterization was carried out under nitrogen atmosphere using an
Agilent 4156C precision semiconductor parameter analyzer. The mobilities
were extracted according to the equation of IDS = μCi (W/2L) (VG – Vth)2, where IDS is the drain current, μ is the mobility in saturation
regime, Ci is the gate dielectric capacitance
per unite area, W and L are the
channel width and length, respectively, VG is the gate voltage, and Vth is the
threshold voltage.
