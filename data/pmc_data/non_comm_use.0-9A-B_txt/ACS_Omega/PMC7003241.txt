The development of an innovative and easy way to run
assays for the quantitative detection of DNA present in biological
fluids (i.e., blood, urine, and saliva) is of great interest for early
diagnosis (e.g., tumors) and personalized medicine. Herein, a new
quantitative assay based on the use of highly sensitive carboxyfluorescein-loaded
liposomes as signal amplification systems is reported. The method
has been tested for the detection of low amounts of DNA sequences.
The reported proof of concept exploits a target DNA molecule as a
linker between two complementary oligonucleotides. One oligonucleotide
is biotinylated at its 3′ end and binds to streptavidin-coupled
magnetic beads, whereas the other one is conjugated to a cholesterol
molecule incorporated in the phospholipidic bilayer of the fluorescent
liposomes. In the presence of the target fragment, the correct formation
of a construct takes place as witnessed by a strong fluorescence signal,
amplified by dissolving lipidic nanoparticles with Triton X-100.
The system is able to detect specific nucleotide sequences with a
very low detection threshold of target DNA (tens of picomolar). The
assay allows the detection of both single- and double-stranded DNA.
Studies performed in human blood serum show the correct assembling
of the probe but with a reduction of limit of detection (up to ∼1
nM). This liposome signal amplification strategy could be used not
only for the detection of DNA but also for other nucleic acids (mRNA;
microRNA) that are difficult to be quantified by currently available
protocols.

==== Body
Introduction
The access to new, fast, and low-cost molecular
diagnostic platforms is crucial to enable more effective monitoring
and personalized treatments in cancer patients. In fact, the rapid
and accurate detection of genomic alterations is at the basis of both
the early diagnosis and the selection of the correct targeted therapy.1 Moreover, in addition to neoplastic diseases,
nucleic acids may represent potential markers for a wide array of
pathologies, including metabolic, inflammatory, and infectious diseases.2 Despite the fact that standard protocols are
still based on tissue biopsies to identify possible genomic alterations,
these methodologies are limited by the difficulties related to the
low accessibility of tumor tissue and by the risks associated with
the repetition of many tissue sampling.3 Recently, the sampling of biological liquids (i.e., blood, serum,
urine, and saliva) has been recognized as an alternative source of
nucleic acids for diagnosis of diseases.1,4,5 In a liquid biopsy technique, great attention is
devoted to the detection of the so-called circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNAs),
a class of tumor-derived DNAs that are not associated with cells and
are fragmented in the bloodstream.6

In general, only very low amounts of ctDNA are present in healthy
patients. Conversely, significant levels of ctDNA can be found in
cancer.5,7,8 The methods
routinely used for DNA/RNA detection involve two steps, namely, (i)
the in vitro amplification of the sequence of interest (by polymerase
chain reaction, PCR, or reverse transcription PCR, RT-PCR) and (ii)
the detection of target DNA/RNA by electrophoresis, southern/northern
blots, sandwich hybridization assays, or next-generation sequencing.8,9 The most innovative and best performing methodologies
are represented by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and beads, emulsification,
amplification, and magnetics (BEAMing). Both of them show several
advantages and disadvantages.10,11 The ddPCR methodology
utilizes a droplet generator that allows the partition of single pieces
of DNA into droplets using an oil/water emulsion. The routine detection
of ctDNA is still hampered in the clinical practice not only for an
intrinsic lack of sensitivity/specificity for ctDNA but also because
the currently available procedures require a high level of expertise
and a long execution time.12 Moreover,
the facilities necessary for the analysis, as flow cytometry and sequencing
machineries, are present in specialized and certified laboratories
for this kind of testing but are not always available in ordinary
diagnostic laboratories.13

Alternatively,
there are many examples of sandwich hybridization protocols based
on the use of highly sensitive radioactive probes14 or gold or fluorescent nanoparticles.15−17 The latter ones are preferred to the radioactive
probes for obvious safety reasons, although they are less sensitive.18 Hence, the development of highly sensitive fluorescence-based
methods for ctDNA detection may be attractive but challenging. In
fact, this could help overcome the drawbacks of classical molecular
biology assays (i.e., the need of a facility and expert staff)19 without the need to use hazardous radioactive
probes.

Useful routes to pursue the signal amplification may
be provided by the use of nanoparticles.20 For example, fluorescein-encapsulating liposomes were reported to
provide a 1000-fold decrease of limit of detection (LOD), with respect
to fluorophore-labeled antibodies, in a sandwich hybridization-based
flow injection analysis system.21 Baeumner
et al. proposed an assay based on dye-loaded liposomes, bearing oligonucleotides
(complementary to the target DNA) on their outer surface and polyethersulfone
membranes with streptavidin immobilized in the detection area.22 The target DNA of interest acts as a linker
between the two shorter oligonucleotide capture probes. Upon loading
high amounts of sulforhodamine B (SR-B) inside liposomal nanoparticles,
the detection threshold was as low as 1 nM analyte.

Starting
from these results, herein, we propose a reproducible, versatile,
and fast assay for DNA detection and quantification based on the use
of highly stable liposomes loaded with fluorescent dyes that can be
stored at 4 °C for 4 months without degradation. The proposed
method does not require neither a high expertise level nor the use
of radioactive molecules. It is based on the use of carboxyfluorescein
(CF)-loaded liposomes functionalized in the lipidic bilayer with a
cholesterol-tagged DNA sequence, which is complementary to a portion
of the target DNA.

The proof of concept of the proposed assay
deals with the capture of both single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA
and dsDNA, respectively) molecules using complementary oligonucleotides,
exploiting the target ssDNA or dsDNA as a linker between two artificial
strands. These strands are bound to dye-encapsulating liposomes through
a cholesterol molecule and to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads via
a biotin molecule. To observe the fluorescent signal from the high
concentrated liposome payload, the lipidic nanoparticles were disrupted
with Triton X-100 obtaining a high increase of signal intensity.

Results and Discussion
Assay Description
The assay consists of the following
four steps:1) Commercially available magnetic beads
functionalized with streptavidin molecules (Strep Mag) are incubated
with a selected 18 base pair (bp) long ssDNA. This ssDNA, referred
to as ANCHOR hereafter, was previously functionalized with a biotin-TEG
group at its 5′ end to bind streptavidin. The ANCHOR fragment
was specifically designed to be complementary with the first 18 nucleotides
present on the 3′ region of the fragment to be detected (referred
to as TARGET hereinafter) (Figure 1).

2) Magnetic
beads, covered with ANCHOR fragments, are incubated for 30 min with
the TARGET containing solution. In the herein reported proof of concept,
this fragment was designed to be 36 bp long. After three washing steps
with Hepes/NaCl buffer, the unbound TARGET molecules and every other
component possibly present in the matrix were washed out.

3) The 5′ portion of
the TARGET fragments bound to the ANCHOR can recognize a third fragment
hereinafter called PROBE. This third fragment, functionalized with
a cholesterol moiety at its 3′ end, was previously intercalated
in the phospholipidic bilayers of a liposome loaded with a highly
concentrated solution of a fluorescent dye. The high concentration
of the dye inside the liposome aqueous cavity causes an extensive
“quenching” of the detectable fluorescence.23

4) After washing, to amplify the fluorescence signal, liposomes are
destroyed with Triton X-100. The signal detected is directly proportional
to the amount of the TARGET fragment bound to magnetic beads through
ANCHOR.



Figure 1 Assay proof of concept: step 1: Streptavidin Mag Sepharose
beads interact with the biotinylated ANCHOR fragment. Step 2: 18 nucleotides
of the ANCHOR fragment recognize specific complementary sequence on
the TARGET fragment. Step 3: cholesteryl-tagged PROBE fragment, conjugated
with 50 mM CF liposome, interacts with the free 18 bp long portion
of the TARGET fragment.

Liposome Characterization
The used liposomes are prepared
with 100% DPPC, a saturated phospholipid that ensures good membrane
stability, avoiding leakage of the fluorescent molecule from the liposome
core. The average diameter measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
was of 110 ± 31 nm with a PDI value of 0.106 ± 0.007. Among
the commercially available dyes, CF was chosen due to its high solubility
in water, its high quantum yield (Φ = 0.92),24 its low commercial cost, and the compatibility with a wide
array of detectors commonly present in analytical laboratories. The
maximum loading CF concentration was set at 50 mM. Higher CF concentrations
were tested (e.g., 75 and 100 mM), but the resulting liposomal formulations,
which display a PDI value higher than 0.5, were not used because of
the occurrence of high instability. When a liposome membrane was destabilized
by Triton X-100, the CF core content is released, and the fluorescent
signal markedly increases (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 (A) Fluorescence intensity measured at increasing concentrations
of SR-loaded (λex = 565 nm, λem =
583 nm) and CF-loaded liposomes (λex = 495 nm, λem = 517 nm) before and after the Triton X-100 addition. (B)

Error bars indicate standard deviation (N = 4).

CF-loaded liposomes where compared with liposomes
of the same membrane composition but carrying up to 150 mM sulforhodamine
B (SR-B) inside their aqueous core. Liposomes loaded with 150 mM SR-B
have been previously reported as suitable probes for sandwich hybridization
assays for nucleic acid markers.20Figure 2 shows that a 3-fold
increase in fluorescence intensity was observed when CF liposomes
were treated with Triton X-100. The concentration of the liposomal
nanoparticles was determined by using the following equation  Further information about this equation is
reported in the Supporting Information.

Although sulforhodamine B-loaded liposomes showed a higher fluorescence
increase when treated with Triton X-100, their minimum detectable
liposome concentration was 2 orders of magnitude higher than the detection
threshold determined for CF-loaded liposomes (10–15 for SR-B liposomes vs 10–17 M for CF liposomes,
as determined through subsequent dilutions in Hepes/NaCl buffer; Figure 2B). Even though SR-B
concentration inside liposomes is three times higher than CF, the
improved performance shown by CF-loaded liposomes might rely on the
different quantum yields of the internalized fluorescent compounds.18,25 These findings state that CF-loaded nanoparticles are more sensitive
at lower concentrations, giving the possibility to investigate a very
low amount of the target ssDNA and possibly detecting nucleic acids
without the need of an amplification procedure. For these reasons,
CF was used in the further experiments to set up the proposed assay.

The occurrence of a stable intercalation of cholesteryl-tagged
ssDNA (PROBE) into the phospholipid bilayer was assessed using high-resolution
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

The specific peaks, characteristic
of nucleotide sequences, appeared only in the 1H-NMR spectrum
of liposomes incubated with the PROBE segment, while any nonspecific
signals were detected in the control ones (Figure S1).

Moreover, the number of dialysis cycles needed to
eliminate the nonencapsulated CF from liposome preparation was evaluated.
It was reported that six dialysis cycles (4 h at 4 °C for each
cycle) are necessary (Figure S2). In concentrated
suspension, the stability of liposomes has been assessed by measuring
the fluorescence signal intensity of intact liposomes and Triton X-100-treated
liposomes. When CF is released from liposomes, a fluorescence enhancement
occurs (because of the “dequencing” of leaked CF). As
reported in Figure S3, liposomes are stable
up to 4 months.

Procedure Setup and Assay Detection Limit
The experimental
setup takes less than 2 h (Figure S4).
During the first 30 min, magnetic beads, ANCHOR, and TARGET fragments
were mixed to carry out the first annealing step. During the following
30 min, incubation in the presence of the PROBE fragment allowed for
the fluorescent labeling of the TARGET. Figure 3 shows the linear range of correlation between
fluorescence intensity and TARGET concentration (Pearson correlation
coefficient = 0.966), with an LOD of 7 × 10–11 M.26 The entire curve of fluorescence
intensity versus [DNA Target] is reported in Figure S5, and the parameters of the calibration curve are reported
in Table S1.

Figure 3 CF-loaded liposome fluorescence intensity measured after
the addition of increasing TARGET concentrations to the Strep Mag
and ANCHOR mixture. The blue line indicates the background fluorescence
intensity measured without the TARGET (purple lines show standard
error of the mean relative to the noise signal). The red line was
obtained by linear fitting of the data. Error bars indicate standard
deviation (N = 10).

After the washing steps,
liposomes bound to Strep Mag beads through the DNA linkage showed
a fluorescence intensity that is not distinguishable from the fluorescence
signal of buffer (Figure 3, green dots). When treated with 0.5% Triton X-100, fluorescence
intensity of the samples showed an increment directly correlated with
the TARGET concentration (Figure 3, black diamonds). Few liposomes were able to bind
to Strep Mag beads in a nonspecific manner when the TARGET fragment
is not present, producing a low interference (Figure 3, blue line).

Next, the possibility
to further improve the detection limit using microcuvettes was explored.
The advantage of using microcuvettes relies on an ∼7 times
reduction of the final volume, thus allowing the increase of the dye
concentration, which can allow the discrimination of lower concentrations
of TARGET (e.g., 2 × 10–11M; Figure 4) not detectable by using the
standard cuvettes (as shown by P values obtained
by using Dunnett’s one-way ANOVA).

Figure 4 Microcuvettes assay. Error bars indicate standard deviation
(N = 4).

The same experiment
was repeated using SB-R-loaded liposomes to assess if the use of this
dye makes it possible to reduce the background fluorescence signal.
The results, as reported in Figure S6,
confirmed the lower performance of this dye. In fact, the LOD was
2 orders of magnitude higher than that of CF-loaded liposomes (2 ×
10–10 M).

Figure 5 shows that SCRAMBLE fragments are not able
to link the liposome and the magnetic components. In fact, the observed
fluorescence signal was not distinguishable from the background in
the absence of the TARGET. Furthermore, by maintaining the scramble-36
and scramble-100 in a 1:1 ratio and varying the TARGET molarity, no
significant interference in the binding of TARGET to the ANCHOR fragment
was noted, even when the SCRAMBLE:TARGET ratio was 1000:1. In fact,
the linearity of the detection of the assay calibration curve did
not vary.

Figure 5 (A) Fluorescence intensity of the solution containing
increasing amount of TARGET and a fixed 2 × 10–8 M scramble mix, added to the Strep Mag ANCHOR mixture. (B) TARGET
concentration is normalized, and signal intensity of the solution
obtained after incubation of TARGET alone is set to 100%. Signal intensities
in the presence of scramble mix are proportionally calculated and
compared to the corresponding TARGET fluorescence signal. Error bars
indicate standard deviation (N = 3).

Assay Behavior in the Presence of Double-Stranded TARGET
The assay response was also evaluated with double helix conformation
of the TARGET fragment (dsTARGET). To obtain dsTARGET, the single-stranded
TARGET was incubated with its complementary reverse fragment, heated
to 85 °C, and then let to cool at room temperature to favor the
correct annealing of the two fragments. The formation of the dsDNA
has been assessed trough agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure S7).

To allow the assembly of the
ANCHOR and PROBE components to the transient ssTARGET fragments, the
samples were heated at 82 °C for 5 min, and then, the temperature
was rapidly decreased in liquid nitrogen for 10 s. To avoid the annealing
of the two complementary fragments and favor the binding of the assay
components, the dsTARGET was incubated together with the ANCHOR and
PROBE fragments in a 1:100 molar ratio. Finally, the liposome was
added as the latest component due to its instability at high temperatures.
No significant differences in signal intensity among the samples incubated
at room temperature with ssTARGET and the ones incubated with dsTARGET
were observed nor among the samples heated to 82 °C (Figure 6). Adding the Strep
Mag beads after the rise in temperature did not alter the obtained
signal intensity, thus suggesting that the overall decrease might
be related to different causes and not the degradation of the magnetic
beads (data not shown).

and single-stranded TARGET DNA (means are not significant among temperature-treated
and not treated samples, P value > 0.05). Error
bars indicate standard deviation (N = 3).

Assay Behavior in Serum
The effect of different biological
matrices, among which is human serum, was tested with the aim of investigating
the efficiency of the proposed DNA assay. The ssTARGET was dissolved
in human serum before performing the already described assay. In serum,
the assembly of the probe appears to be greatly hampered (Figure 7 and Figure S8), and the assay detection limit was
2 orders of magnitude higher, setting the LOD to 0.8 × 10–9 M. These findings led us to investigate the possibility
of unwanted interactions among serum and assay components, in particular,
with albumin, which is the most abundant serum protein. However, fluorescence
measurements demonstrated that the presence of albumin did not affect
the assembly of the components and the fluorescence signal intensity
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Assay behavior in Hepes, Hepes + HSA, and human serum:
fluorescence intensity (a.u.) was measured after the addition of two
concentrations of DNA TARGET (3.3 × 10–10 and
2.0 × 10–9 M) in three different media (P value > 0.05). Error bars indicate standard deviation
(N = 3).

Further
investigations were carried out to determine the role of phosphates
on the decrease of assay performance (i.e., increased LOD) in serum.
Thus, the assay components were assembled in PBS buffer prepared with
1 and 10 mM phosphate concentrations. As seen from albumin, no significant
decrease in the detected fluorescence intensity of the assay was observed,
suggesting that phosphates do not play a role in the assembly of the
deoxyribonucleic nor protein components (Figure S9). Finally, serum was inactivated through heating for 25
min at 55 °C and the assay performed as previously stated. No
significant differences among not treated and treated sera have been
observed, suggesting that the complement is not responsible for the
decrease of the assay performance in this complex biological matrix
(Figure S10). This can be due to the activity
of DNase I, one of the components of the circulating free DNA (cfDNA)
elimination system.27

Conclusions
The herein described assay allows the detection
of both single- and double-stranded DNA, measuring the signal arising
from a fluorescent dye (carboxyfluorescein) encapsulated into liposomes
at high concentration and released upon treatment with detergents
(i.e., Triton X-100). The optimized liposomes are stable for a long
period of time (∼4 months) when stored at high concentration
at 4 °C. The LOD of target DNA is 7 × 10–11 M, making it possible to investigate specific nucleotidic sequences
at very low concentrations. Moreover, in comparison to multistep coupling
procedures, the incorporation of a cholesteryl-modified ssDNA probe
was allowed to obtain targeted liposomes without using expensive coupling
reagents and time-consuming coupling procedures.21,28 Most
of the commonly used techniques (among which are ddPCR and BEAMing)
and sensors for DNA/RNA detection in liquid biopsies29 have received an in-depth validation for clinical and preclinical
applications.30,31 Compared to the these techniques,
the herein proposed method shows the following advantages: (i) fast
assay (execution time, approximately 2 h); (ii) simplicity of execution,
while both ddPCR and BEAMing need a medium–high level of expertise
to be performed and require the presence of loader and reader machineries,
which have an elevated price, whose purchase may not be justified
for laboratories not fully dedicated to routinely screen for DNA markers;
(iii) the decrease of biases derived from multiple amplifications
of the low amount of starting nucleotidic material. Moreover, it is
worth to mention the improvements with respect to the method reported
by Baumner et al.,22 namely, (i) a lower
LOD (2 orders of magnitude); (ii) the use of a more efficient fluorescent
dye (carboxyfluorescein); (iii) the use of Triton X-100 to obtain
a fluorescence dequencing; and (iv) the use of magnetic beads instead
of immobilized surfaces that have been proven to be very efficient
for this kind of quantitative assays.32 As previously reported, plasma concentration values of cell-free
DNA in melanoma and lung cancer patients are ∼36 and 31 ng/mL
plasma, respectively.33 The fragment length
range is 134–144 bp.25 Thus, using
650 g/mol as the average molecular weight for a base pair, we can
theorize that the plasma cfDNA concentration range for these patients
is 1× 10–10 to 6 × 10–10 M. Considering that the fraction of mutant DNA ranges from 0.005
to 0.1% of the total DNA concentration in plasma,34 the expected amount of mutated DNA in serum is in the 10–13 to 10–15 M range. In the case
of colon carcinoma, the amount of mutant cfDNA increases dramatically,
reaching a value of ∼8%.11,35 This value is of the
order of 10–11 M, that is, in the same order of
magnitude of the LOD of the herein proposed assay, when the latter
is performed in Hepes buffer. In principle, by exploiting a purification
method to extract ctDNA from their biological matrices, it would be
possible to detect and quantify nucleic acid markers without further
amplification. In principle, the LOD of the herein reported method
can be further reduced (i.e., enhanced assay performance) by using
larger liposomes (e.g, medium unilamellar vesicles or giant liposomes),
that is, containing a higher amount of fluorescent dye encapsulated
in the inner core and/or by using a fluorescent dye with a higher
quantum yield. Furthermore, other items have to be considered, especially
for measurements in serum-containing specimens. First of all, the
role of DNases in degradation of the target DNA has to be evaluated.
For instance, serum DNA extraction protocols (based on phenol–chloroform
extraction or pull-down techniques) can be employed to check whether
this may contribute to the loss of sensitivity.

The herein reported
method appears suitable, upon proper optimization, for the screening
of circulating cancer DNA. The developed assay is versatile. In fact,
by maintaining the proposed scheme (liposomes formulation, magnetic
beads, etc.), it is possible to properly design the DNA sequences
of ANCHOR and PROBE to specifically recognize TARGET sequences. Moreover,
considering previously reported works, it appears possible to expand
the herein reported method to the detection of longer (>36 bp)
target DNA molecules.36,37

This is, in principle,
applicable to the detection of DNA circulating in biological fluids
(not only circulating tumor DNA). As an example, one may think of
a number of pathogenic microorganisms that release their DNA in the
bloodstream, thus opening the possibility to exploit their nucleic
acids as markers for characterizing infectious diseases. Setting the
nucleotidic sequence of the ANCHOR and PROBE fragments on a specific
target sequence, the possibilities in the different markers detectable
are limited only by the assay LOD.

Finally, future investigations
could also lead to tune and validate the assay for the detection of
RNAs, another class of diagnostic and prognostic markers rising in
interest nowadays.38 This class of molecules
is more difficult than DNAs to be analyzed since RNAs are more prone
to enzymatic degradation and because of the complexity and biases
present in RNA amplification protocols.

Experimental Session
Materials
DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcoline) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Alabaster, Alabama, USA). Cholesterol, sodium chloride, sodium monobasic
phosphate, sodium dibasic phosphate, potassium chloride, Hepes, chloroform,
and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from
Eurofin Genomics. Lyophilized human serum (Seronorm) was purchased
from SERO AS, Norway.

Liposome Preparation
Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV)
liposomes were prepared according to the classical thin lipid film
hydration method as previously reported.39−41 Briefly, 45 mg of DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcoline) were dissolved in a chloroform
solution in a 250 mL glass balloon. The chloroform has been subsequently
evaporated by using a rotavapor device in vacuum conditions at 60
rpm at room temperature (RT). The lipid film formed after the solvent
evaporation was left stirring for 1.5 h at RT to remove the presence
of any water contamination. Subsequently, 1.5 mL of 50 mM carboxyfluorescein
solution, in Hepes buffer (0.15 M NaCl, 3.8 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, ∼320
mOsm/L), was added to the lipid film. Then, it was heated through
immersion in a water bath at a temperature of 56 °C, which corresponds
to the transition phase temperature of DPPC phospholipids. The bottom
of the balloon was vortexed at max speed to ensure the detachment
of the film from the glass wall of the recipient. These heating and
vibrating steps were performed multiple times until the complete lipid
film detachment. The formed solution was then introduced in an extruder
device, heated at 56 °C, and under argon pressure, the vesicles
were forced to pass through a 400 nm filter membrane. After eight
runs, the filter membrane was changed with a 200 nm one, and other
eight runs were performed. To eliminate the unloaded CF molecules,
the LUVs’ suspension (1.5 mL) underwent extensive dialysis
cycles against isotonic Hepes/NaCl buffer solution (2 L) at 4 °C
by using a 14 kDa dialysis cellulose membrane. The external Hepes
solution was replaced every 4 h for six cycles. After purification,
the liposome size was determined by using dynamic light scattering
(DLS) technology with a Zetasizer Malvern instrument. Liposomes were
then stored at 4 °C in the absence of light to avoid photobleaching
of the fluorescent molecules.42 Under these
storage conditions, liposomes remained stable for at least 4 months.

Cholesteryl–DNA-Tagged Liposome Preparation
DPPC liposomes (1 × 10–8 M) containing 50
mM CF were diluted 1:10 in sterile Hepes buffer (150 μL of liposome
solution in 1.35 mL of Hepes buffer). PROBE DNA was then added to
this solution in a 300:1 PROBE/liposome ratio, and the resultant solution
was incubated for 1.5 h on a shaking ThermoMixer at 4 °C in slow
speed in the absence of light.

Subsequently, the solution was
dialyzed overnight against 2 L of Hepes buffer in a 16 kDa MWCO dialysis
membrane at 4 °C in dark conditions to ensure the elimination
of unbound PROBE molecules. After the dialysis, the functionalized
liposomes were stored at 4 °C in dark conditions.

NMR Characterization
Liposome specimens (20 μL)
have been dissolved in CHCl3 into a 125 mL glass balloon.
This procedure allows destroying liposomes and dissolving all the
apolar molecules. Then, CHCl3 was evaporated using a rotavapor,
and the specimen dissolved into deuterated methanol.

1H NMR spectra of specimens have been acquired at 4 °C using
a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer (AVANCE 600, 14 T).43

ssDNA Molecule Design
ssDNA molecules were purchased
from Eurofin Genomics. A quality certificate describing yield and
purification steps of the ordered oligonucleotide was delivered by
the company together with the product. ssDNAs were artificially designed
to be representatives of DNA sequences occurring in biological fluids.
They have been designed through MeltCalculator, a Biophysics Integrated
DNA Technologies online tool, through which the presence of self-dimers,
hairpins structures, and annealing temperatures have been calculated.

ssDNAs used in our experiments have the following sequences:TARGET: 5′ CTG GAC TGT TGA TTG TGG GAT TGA TAG
GGC GAC TGC 3′.

ANCHOR: 5′-biotin-TEG-GCA
GTC GCC CTA TCA ATC-3′.

PROBE:
5′-CCA CAA TCA ACA GTC CAG-cholesterol-3′.

CGG CAT GCG CAA CTT GTG AAG TGC CTA CTA TCC TTA AAC GCA TAT CTC GCA
CAG TAA CTC CCC AAT ATG TGA GCA TCT GAT GTT GCC CGG GCC GAG T-3′.



Lyophilized ssDNAs were rehydrated with sterile Tris-EDTA
solution to obtain a final concentration of 100 μM. Purity of
the shipped ssDNA samples was guaranteed by the manufacturer company
and subsequently double-checked in our lab trough Nanodrop analysis.

Double-stranded TARGET DNA has been obtained through mixing the
two complementary fragments TARGET and REVERSE TARGET in equimolar
amounts, heating to 82 °C, and letting it cure at room temperature
to assure the correct annealing of these two ssDNAs.

Assay Protocol
Sterile Hepes buffer (3 mL) was added
to a 15 mL Falcon tube, and 3 μL of streptavidin-coated magnetic
beads were added (Streptavidin Mag Sepharose, GE Healthcare S.P.A.).
A 3 μL ANCHOR ssDNA 100 μM solution was added to this
solution together with the desired amount of TARGET ssDNA. The Falcon
tubes were placed on a shaker, and the beads and DNA mix were incubated
for 30 min at room temperature to permit the binding of all the probe
components. The tubes were then centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 rpm,
and the magnetic beads were retained through a magnet. The solution
was then eliminated together with all the unbound probe components,
and three washing steps were performed using Hepes buffer. Cholesteryl–PROBE-tagged
liposome (100 μL) was added to the 3 mL Hepes buffer solution
containing the beads and the components bound from the previous step.
This solution was placed for 30 min on a shaker at medium speed and
4 °C in dark conditions. After this incubation, the tubes were
again centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 rpm. Washing steps were performed
to ensure that the elimination of all the elements was not bound to
the magnetic beads until basal fluorescence intensity was comparable
with the one present in Hepes buffer.

Triton X-100 (0.5%; Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to the liposome solution. After 15 min, the total fluorescence
intensity was analyzed with a spectrofluorometer (FluoroMax-4, Horiba
Jobin Yvon). Spectrofluorometric excitation and emission parameters
were set, respectively, at wavelengths of 492 and 517 nm, wavelengths
for carboxyfluorescein molecules, and at 565 and 586 nm for sulforhodamine
B.

In the experiments performed in serum, Strep Mag beads, ANCHOR,
and TARGET ssDNA were directly added to the serum (human serum, Seronorm
SERO AS) and positioned on a shaker in slow speed at RT for 1 h. Then,
the samples were treated as described above with a centrifugation
step, three washing steps in Hepes buffer, and the addition of DNA–cholesterol-tagged
liposomes.

Data Analysis and Statistic
Data have been obtained
by using at least three independent experiments. The exact number
of replicates has been inserted in each graph.

Data have been
reported as mean ± SD.

Pearson correlation coefficient
of data in Figure 3 has been evaluated.

Unpaired two-tailed Student t test has been carried out in Figures 5 and 6.

Dunnett’s
(one-way ANOVA) statistical test has been applied for the data in Figures 2B and 4. One-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction has been applied
for the data in Figure 7.44

The following legend has been
added to the figures: *P value < 0.05; **P value < 0.01; and ***P value <
0.001.

LOD has been calculated by using the following equation:
LOD = 3σ/m, where σ is the SD of blank
and m is the slope of linear fitting of data in the
linear range.
