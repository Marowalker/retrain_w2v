In this study, we
report, for the first time, the synthesis of
two original nanosystems, based on gold Au(III) and copper Cu(II):
simple gold–copper nanoparticles (Cu0AuNPs) and
enriched monopicolinate cyclam (L1)–Cu(II)–Au(III)-complex
(L1@Cu2+AuNPs). The two nanomaterials differ substantially
by the chelation or not of the Cu(II) ions during the NPs synthesis
process. The two hybrid nanoparticles (Cu0AuNPs; L1@Cu2+AuNPs) were deeply studied from the chemical and physical
point of view, using many different analytical techniques such as
Raman and UV–vis spectroscopy, electron transmission microscopy,
and dynamic light scattering. Both nanosystems show morphological
and good chemical stability at pH 4 values and in physiological conditions
during 98 h. Undifferentiated and neural differentiated murine embryonic
stem cells were used as a model system for in vitro experiments to
reveal the effects of NPs on these cells. The comparative study between
Cu0AuNPs and L1@Cu2+AuNPs highlights that copper
chelated in its +2 oxidation state in the NPs is more functional for
biological application.

1 Introduction
Hybrid
metal–organic nanoparticles (NPs) have been recently
used as diagnostic and therapeutic tools to better understand, detect,
and treat several human diseases.1,2 Metal-based
NPs have been proposed as performing contrast agents that can increase
signal intensity in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron
emission tomography imaging, or as nanovectors for specifically delivering
of drugs inside cells.

The insertion of copper (Cu), especially
as Cu2+ atoms,
in NPs structures is still challenging because it has an important
impact in many scientific fields from catalysis and plasmonics up
to nanomedicine applications.3−6 Because cationic metals take part in biological systems
(charge balancing, stabilizing structures, reactions catalyzing, and
so on), copper ions should be chelated to avoid the in vivo metal
releasing that could induce several undesirable effects.

Biocompatible
copper(II) chelators are commonly those that yield
thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert complexes so that transchelation
of Cu due to competition with other biological ligands, metals, or
reductive media is avoided. Among known copper(II) ligands, azacycloalkanes
present the highest complexion properties.7 By N-functionalization of their properties, especially
in terms of kinetic of formation (maximizing the complexation rate)
and dissociation (decreasing of the decomplexation rate), could also
be improved. A special category of rigid tetraazamacrocycles, indicated
as cross-bridged derivatives, has been the source of great interest
because of the outstanding behavior in complexing different metals,
including copper(II).8−10 Due to an ethylene linker connecting two opposite
nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle, these ligands produced some of the
most inert metal complexes ever reported.

We recently have published
a size-adapted azamacrocycle, the cb-te1pa
chelator11−13 (see its structure in Figure 1), which combines all the criteria for Cu(II)
chelation, i.e., the presence of cyclam, the ethylene cross bridge
and an efficient chelating functionalization, in particular the methyl
pycolinic acid, a cross-bridged cyclam bearing a methylpycolinate
pendant. This compound was able to chelate copper(II) after fast complexation,
yielding a highly thermodynamical stable and an exceptionally inert
product, even if Cu was in the (+1) oxidation state. Due to the presence
of a secondary amine, an additional functional group, which could
be dedicated to the conjugation of cb-te1pa with a solid support,
was then easily added as an aniline moiety. To preserve a sufficient
distance between the coordination center and the anchoring point,
an ethylene linker was chosen to take away the aromatic part. The
bifunctionalized analogue cb-te1pa-EtpPhNH2 (L1) was then the final Cu ligand (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Ligand cb-te1pa and its bifunctionalized analogue
cb-te1pa-EtpPhNH2.

In the present study, we synthesized two new nanoparticle
systems
including gold and copper wrapped in their structure. In the first
case, Cu(II) was introduced as “free” cation and in
the second case, in its [Cu(cb-te1pa)]+-EtpPhNH2 chelated form (L1Cu+). According to the
NPs formation procedure, the first material included Cu0, whereas the second one the Cu2+ chelated ions. Characterizations
were performed to investigate the structure of both NPs. Potential
cytotoxic effects was evaluated in vitro on undifferentiated and neural
differentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs can be used as a
model system in basic research, drug discovery, biomedical applications,
and nanotechnology because they combine the potential of unlimited
self-renewal with the ability to differentiate into a wide range of
tissue-specific cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Formation Mechanisms of Au–Cu-Based
Nanoparticles
Peculiar molecular interactions between organic
compounds and metal chlorides was extensively studied for many biochemical
and physical applications.19−22 The aim of this study was to use a copper–gold
chloride blend as the building blocks of hybrid nanoparticles under
specific conditions of reaction. For this purpose, in the first step,
we mixed HAuCl4·3H2O and CuCl2·6H2O in water solution at room temperature under
specific pH conditions (Scheme 1). The formation of Au–Cu blend (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) could be deduced
by looking at the fingerprints of each single solution (HAuCl4·3H2O, CuCl2·6H2O) present in the UV–vis spectrum of their mix (Au–Cu).
In particular, the UV–vis spectrum of HAuCl4·3H2O (black line in Figure S1) showed
typical signatures with two prominent peaks at 256 and 290 nm. The
UV–vis spectrum of CuCl2·6H2O solution
showed a peak at 256 nm, a small peak at 280 nm and a broadened peak
at 800 nm (red line in Figure S1). When
CuCl2·6H2O was added to HAuCl4·3H2O solution, the UV–vis spectrum (blue
line in Figure S1) slightly changed. Main
difference in the spectra was due to the increase and the shift of
the peak from 280 to 320 nm due to electronic transitions. Moreover,
the dramatic decrease of the peak at 800 nm confirmed that the hybrid
system (Au–Cu) was obtained.20

not in scale and are not intended to be representative of the full
samples composition.

Raman spectroscopy (Figure S1B) also
displayed the peak at 254 cm–1 due to Cu–Au–Cl
and Cu–OH stretching, which were assigned to vibrations mainly
within the coordination sphere of Cu2+, confirming the
successful reaction.20

Figure S2a,b in the Supporting Information
shows the localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance spectra before
and after incubation of HAuCl4 mixed to CuCl2 under specific conditions (pH: 4.0–7.0–9.0; time:
96 h). At pH 4, we observed an increase in the peak intensity at 256
nm probably due to CuCl2 fingerprint associated to AuCl2 ions upon complexation. The increase of the peak at 800 nm
confirmed the reaction under acidic conditions. A different behavior
was observed in the case of pH 7 and pH 9 (Figure S2 panel b), in which the LSP bands could not be observed any
more after incubation at pH 7 and 9 for 96 h. This spectroscopic behavior
during pH release gave evidence of the change of reagent conformation
when it was encapsulated into gold nanoparticles.

2.2 Formation Mechanism of Cu0–AuNPs
and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
Recently, Spadavecchia
et al. have designed and produced different novel hybrid nanomaterials
based on gold, polymers, proteins, and drug complexes by original
chemical synthetic methodology.17,24,25 These authors have investigated the formation mechanism and the
competition effect between various capping agents on the growth process
of hybrid nanoparticles.26 Some chemical–physical
characterizations and the analysis of biological activity have fully
elucidate that conformation change of biomolecules (i.e., polymer,
drug, protein) during the formation of hybrid gold nanostructures
by chelation had a good impact on its therapeutic activity. In case
of Cu, other authors showed that copper influenced the optical plasmonic
features of the gold nanorods when incorporated in the growth solution
during the seed-mediated synthesis.4 The
aim of this research was to prove the formation of stable hybrid complexes
based on PEGylated Au–Cu and PEGylated L1@Au–Cu, respectively.
Some synthesis procedures of Cu2+AuNPs by chemical and
physical adsorption using chelator linkers can be found in recent
literature.19,27 The main difference with previously
reported synthetic procedures was that L1 ligand totally bound Cu2+ and participated in the stabilization of PEGylated Cu2+–AuNPs via electrostatic interaction between their
amino groups with chloride copper–auric ions. Moreover, the
chelation of Cu2+ avoided its reduction during the NPs
synthesis process. Indeed, the macrocyclic chelation added extremely
high stability to the copper(I) complex and allowed the stability
of the chelate all along the formation of the final material.

The formation of hybrid gold–copper NPs from Cu–Au
mixture is summarized in Schemes 2 and 3. Step (1) was the complexation of solutions CuCl2–AuCl4– and generation of copper–gold clusters
(see Scheme 2). Step
(2) is the initial reduction of Au(III) ions by dicarboxylic acid-terminated
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) that adsorbed onto Cu–Au clusters
(Scheme 2); the last
step (3) is the reduction of metal ions in that vicinity and the growth
of hybrid gold particles (Cu0–AuNPs) together with
the colloidal stabilization due to the molecules of PEG polymers.

Scheme 3 Schematic Representation
of the Synthesis of L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
via a Three-Step Process
Please note that drawings
are
not in scale and are not intended to be representative of the full
samples composition.

In this frame, L1 ligands
take part in the reaction, thanks to
their amino group onto copper–gold clusters in which copper
was kept in oxidation state Cu2+ and chelated with them
(Scheme 3). The positive
charge of the amino group onto L1 ligand in water solutions showed
strong electrostatic interaction with negatively charged Cu2+–AuCl ions and formed a complex L1@Cu2+–AuCl
that played a final role in the growth of NPs. A large excess of L1
ligand in the mixture was required to chelate completely all Cu2+. The addition of diacid PEG improved the kinetics of reduction
by complexation of Cu–Au ions,28,26 just tuning
the growth process of hybrid nanoparticles. During the S2 phase (Scheme 3), L1@Cu2+–AuCl complexes migrated through PEG molecules. Thus, an appreciable
amount of complexes diffused and were captured inside the PEG layer
via a mechanism similar to the other ligand complexes loaded onto
nanostructures.16,24,29 Based on previously research studies,30 we suppose that when PEG was added to the L1@Cu2+–AuCl,
the PEG initially was bound to hybrid complex in a mushroom conformation
followed by a conformational change to brush mode.15,17 The final reduction by NaBH4 completed the grow process
to form L1@Cu2+–AuNPs. All products of our synthetic
procedure were characterized by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy.

2.3 Comparative Physicochemical Characterization
of Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
TEM images of Cu0–AuNPs showed a well dispersion
of the nanoparticles with an average size of 20 ± 1 nm (Figure 2A overpanel). Different
nanostructures were obtained with L1@Cu2+–AuNPs:
they exhibited a nanocapsule-like shape embedded in a shell of PEG,
in which metal nanoparticles showed a diameter of around 28 ±
2 nm (Figure 2A underpanel).
The synthesis of Au/Cu alloy nanoparticles using biocompatible liquid
polymer22 and the fabrication of snowflakes
nanoparticles by catalytic CO oxidation11 have been already reported. Anyway, a study about the grafting of
L1 ligands onto Cu0–AuNPs has not been reported.
When L1 ligands were added to the Cu2+–AuCl solution,
the picolinate amino group was initially electrostatically bound to
Au–Cu clusters, followed by a conformational change of the
ligand L1 that chelated Cu2+ ions completely and successively
embedded in the dicarboxylic PEG in a mushroom conformation.15

Figure 2B
black
line reports the absorption spectra of hybrid Cu0–AuNPs,
all characterized by a surface plasmon band in the range of 560 nm,
together with a small peak at 775 nm. The slow shift of the band position
depended on the ratio of the gold salt and the capping materials during
the reaction processes.31,32 This peak could be
generally ascribed to collective oscillation, known as the surface
plasmon oscillation of the metal electrons in the conduction band,
due to interaction of electrons with light of a certain wavelength.
PEG could be used as a stabilizing polymer for AuNPs because the dispersed
solutions could be obtained due to the formation of coordination bands
between Au and Cu ions with the carboxylic group. The chelation effect
even better dispersed Au and Cu ions, which were reduced to form single
Cu0–AuNPs of relatively uniform size. Figure 2B red line displays a UV–vis
an absorption spectrum of L1@Cu2+–Au NPs. Compared
with Cu0–AuNPs spectrum, a blue shift of the plasmon
peak from 560 to 535 nm and a red shift of the peak at 775–810
nm could be observed. The latter was associated to π–π*
electronic transitions due to interactions between the L1 ring and
CuAuCl2 ions and gave a clear evidence of the complex formation
with a change of color of the colloidal solution from pink red (Cu0–AuNPs) to bright violet (L1@Cu2+–Au
NPs).

The NP sizes were confirmed by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements
(Table 1). ζ-Potential
measurements showed that Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs were stable colloids at physiological pH (ζ-potential
= −25 ± 3 and −20 ± 2 mV with a PdI equal
to 0.3) (Table 1).
This stability was enhanced by the presence of the PEG layer around
nanoparticles.26

L1@Cu2+–AuNPs	–20 ± 2	28 ± 2	0.3	
Raman
spectra of Cu0–AuNPs exhibited many bands
in the region 500–2000 cm–1 (Figure 3C black line). The wide band
observed around 1600 cm–1 on the Raman spectra was
assigned to the water. The strong band at 1712 cm–1 was assigned to C=O carbonyl stretching of PEG diacid. The
intense doublet at 720–760 cm–1 was due to
the C–H plane deformation and a strong peak at 1439 cm–1 was assigned to νC–C stretching. These
bands were due to the variation of the steric conformation of the
PEG diacide and became more prominent upon complexation with Cu–AuCl2, as previously described.16,20 As matter
of fact, when C=O and hydroxyl groups of PEG diacide interacted
with a metal, the sterical conformation became more tilted with respect
to the planar one. Focusing on the spectral range 200–500 cm–1 (Figure 2C), we can observe several spectral changes, which confirmed
a chemical modification of Cu after complexation with gold ions and
PEG diacide molecules. One of the Raman fingerprint of the Cu–PEG–AuNPs
was the presence of a band around 263 cm–1, and
a double peak at 235–285 cm–1 was observed.
These bands could be assigned to the gold chloride stretches, ν(Au–Cl),
and δ(O–Au–O) and δ(Cu–Au–O)
are a clear evidence of the formation of a complex between AuCl2– and Cu and PEG diacide in the solution.
The peak at 430 cm–1 was due to the vibrations δ(OH···O),
ν(OH···O) of the PEG, as previously described.15,16 The bands in the region 3000 cm–1 could be assigned
to the aromatic C–H stretching (Figure 2C). A broad band composed of some peaks appeared
in the spectral range 2850–2930 due to the symmetric CH2–CH3 stretch vibration of PEG diacide molecules,
confirming the main role of the polymer in the synthesis of the nanoparticle.
The steric arrangement of L1 ligand during the synthesis process of
PEGylated copper–gold nanoparticles was confirmed by Raman
spectroscopic analysis (Figure 2C).

Figure 3 Cytotoxicity of ES cells incubated with different concentrations
of Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2–AuNPs nanoparticles
(0–10 μM) for 24 h. Bar = 50 μm.

Raman spectra of free L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
in water
showed SERS effect in the range 300–1800 cm–1. The spectral modifications were evidence of the steric conformational
change of the L1 after grafting on the copper–gold nanoparticles.
One of the Raman fingerprints of the L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
was the presence of a band around 340 cm–1 due to
the copper(II) peroxide complex, where L1 chelates Cu2+. The common peak at 450 cm–1 was due to the vibrations
δ(OH···O), ν(OH···O) of
the PEG as previously described.15,16 On the basis
of the spectrochemical and previously theoretical findings, we assumed
that Au3+ ions promoted the deprotonation of the L1 amino
group. These bands were due to variation of the steric conformation
of the L1 and became more prominent upon electrostatic interaction
with gold cluster and then chelation with Cu2+.

2.4 Cytotoxicity of Cu0–AuNPs
and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
Murine ES cells and neural-derived
ES cells were exposed to Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs nanoparticles at different concentrations (0–1000
nM) for 24 h (Figure 3), and cytotoxicity was analyzed by live–dead staining, and
LC50 was calculated. At maximum used concentration (10 μM),
both kinds of nanoparticles determined the death of almost all the
cells. They resulted not cytotoxic for concentrations up to 100 nM,
suggesting a fair good biocompatibility at this concentration. However,
the NPs were found to display significant cytotoxicity still at the
concentration of 250 nM. The nanoparticles showed concentration-dependent
cytotoxicity in both cells: the neural-derived ES cells were more
sensitive toward the toxicity of both particles than the undifferentiated
ES cells. The results highlight the difference of cytotoxicity between
nanoparticles used and differential sensitivity of cells to Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2–AuNPs. However,
the toxic response varied depending on the type of cell exposed due
to differential sensitivity.

The results obtained on ES cells
were used to identify the range of NPs concentrations to test the
cytotoxicity on neural-derived ES cells. These cells were exposed
to the same concentration of Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs, i.e., 0–100–250–1000
nM, for 24 h. The 50% of lethal dose for both NPs, reported in Table 2, was determined using
trypan blue dye exclusion.

Table 2 LD50 of Neural-Derived
ES Cells after
24 h of Treatment with Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2+–AuNPs Nanoparticles
 	LD50% (nM)	LD50% (μg/mL)	
Cu0–AuNPs	600	0.16	
L1@Cu2+–AuNPs	950	0.25	
On neural-derived ES cells, the Cu0–AuNPs were
more toxic, with LD50 value of 600 nM, than the L1@Cu2+–AuNPs nanoparticles, with LD50 value of 950 nM. Light microscopy
analysis characterized the effect of different concentrations of NPs
on neural-derived ES cells morphology. Even at 100 nM, both NPs preserved
the cell viability and morphology, with quite equal toxicity profile
observed for both NPs; at 250 nM, neural-derived ES cells treated
with L1@Cu2+–Au NPs exhibited more neurite reduction
than those treated with Cu0–AuNPs. At 1000 nM of
both NPs, the cells appeared to refract the light, suggesting a typical
apoptotic phenotype (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Cytotoxicity of neural-derived ES cells incubated with different
concentrations of Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2+–AuNPs nanoparticles (0–100–250–1000
nM) for 24 h. Bar = 50 μm.

2.5 Determination of Cellular Uptake of NPs by
Confocal Microscopy
The neural-derived ES cells were plated
on a gelatin-coated microscope slide and left to adhere overnight
before adding Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
labeled with the fluorophore at 200 nM, a concentration well below
the LD50 for both kinds of NPs. As shown in Figure 5, both NPs synthetized were internalized
into neural-derived ES cells but with some qualitative differences.
Confocal images showed Cu0–AuNPs internalized more
than L1@Cu2+–AuNPs. Moreover, even if slightly larger,
the Cu0–AuNPs were internalized also inside the
nucleus. This capability may be caused by a more efficient interaction
with mammalian cell membranes.

Figure 5 Confocal fluorescence images of neural-derived
ES cells incubated
with Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
(200 μg/mL) for 24 h. Bar = 50 μm.

Confocal images confirmed that NPs were mainly located within
the
cell and not adhered to the cell surface: the fluorescent signal of
Cu0–AuNPs was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm
and also in the nuclei; on the contrary, the fluorescent signal of
L1@Cu2+–AuNPs was prevalently present in the cytoplasm
(Figure 5).

From
data collected in biological experiments, a type-selective
difference in NP toxicity was observed. A possible reason for the
difference in uptake and distribution inside the neural-derived ES
cells could be the different surface chemistry of two NPs synthetized,
which could improve the endocytosis mechanisms up to the nucleus in
case of Cu0–AuNPs. Experimental results indicated
that the differences between Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs nanoparticles as well as the target cell type
were critical determinants of intracellular responses and degree of
cytotoxicity. At this stage, it was not possible to completely highlight
the mechanism underlying the differential toxicity. The evidence emerging
from the experimental results was that apoptosis is the predominant
death pathway for moderate concentrations of NPs in the solution,
whereas necrosis was the predominant pathway for high concentrations
of NPs, according to the data reported in literature.33,34 Large amount of Cu-based nanoparticles, once internalized in neurons,
caused severe alterations of cell morphology up to membrane disruption,
according to the images reported in Figure 4 from concentrations of 100 nM onward. Light
concentration of copper NPs inside neuron cells caused apoptosis as
a consequence of oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species
associated to metallic nanoparticles.

2.6 Optical
Imaging of Cells
Internalization
of cells of the synthesized colloids (Cu0AuNPs and L1@Cu2+AuNPs) was carried out with a confocal microscope (Horiba
Scientifics) under bright- and dark-field illumination. The images
reported in Figures S3 and S4 are from
the treated ES neuronal cells in different areas, the same sample
region was seen in bright-field (a) and dark-field conditions (b).
The dark-field image showed a high density of bright, small scattering
centers dispersed all over the glass slide. The density of these bright
spots clearly showed an effect of concentration addiction when the
colloids were incubated. It appears that the colloids had a tendency
to accumulate inside the cells in the experimental conditions previously
described.17

3 Materials
and Methods
All chemicals were of reagent grade or higher
and used as received
unless otherwise specified. Tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4·H2O), CuCl2·6H2O, sodium
borohydride (NaBH4), poly(ethylene glycol)-600 (PEG 600),
and phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.0, pH 4.0, pH 9.0)

3.1 L1 Synthesis
L1 synthesis was based
on previous work that is summarized in Scheme 4. Briefly, starting from compound 1, the methyl ester of te1pa, the addition of 4-nitrophenylethyl bromide
led to compound 2 with 85% yield. The specific reduction
of the nitrophenyl was managed with tin chloride with 83% yield and
produced compound 3. A final hydrolysis removed the ester
function and generated the bifunctional cb-te1pa-EtpPhNH2 (compound 4). In the following sections,
the final product cb-te1pa-EtpPhNH2 will
be simply called L1.

The high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) analyses were performed
at the Institute of Analytic and Organic Chemistry, ICOA in Orleans.
In details, compound L1 was synthetized by a three-step procedure,
which is reported in the following section. Results of HR-MS are reported
for each step in the Supporting Information.

3.1.1 Step (i): trans-Di-N-functionalization of Cross-Bridged Monomethylpicolinate
Cyclam (Compound 1) Yielding Compound 2
4-Nitrophenylethyl bromide (0.968 g, 4.20 mmol) and potassium carbonate
(0.872 g, 6.31 mmol) were add to a solution of 1 (0.865,
2.10 mmol) in 200 mL of distilled acetonitrile. The mixture was refluxed
overnight. After the evaporation of the solvent, the crude product
was purified by column chromatography in silica gel (CHCl3/MeOH 8:2) to yield compound 2 as a yellow oil (1.000
g, 85%).

3.1.2 Step (ii): Reduction
of Compound 2 Yielding
Compound 3
Tin chloride (1.810 g, 9.55 mmol) and compound 2 (0.500 g, 0.95 mmol) were add to a 40 mL solution 1:9 of
MeOH/HCl aq 12 M. The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight
and then excess HCl was neutralized using potassium carbonate. The
desired compound 3 was obtained by extraction with chloroform
at pH 14 as yellow oil (420 mg, 83%).

3.1.3 Step
(iii): Hydrolysis of Compound 3 Yielding
Compound 4 (L1)
Hydrochloric acid (10 mL, 6 M) was slowly
added to compound 3 (0.200 g, 0.38 mmol) and the mixture
was refluxed overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent
was evaporated to yield compound 4 (L1) as an off-white
solid in quantitative yield.

3.2 Synthesis
of Cu0–AuNPs
Twenty milliliters of 0.0001
M aqueous HAuCl4 was mixed
with 5 mL of CuCl2·6H20 solution (6.10
× 10–5 M in water) at room temperature for
1 h under magnetic stirring to form a Au–Cu blend. Then, 250
μL of poly(ethylene glycol) 600 diacid (PEG) was mixed to the
blend solution under stirring for 2 h. After this time, 3.6 mL of
NaBH4 (0.01 M) was added dropwise, followed by rapid stirring
and kept without agitation for 2 h. The color of the dispersion indeed
instantly changed from green-yellow to pink-red when sodium borohydride
was added to a solution of copper–gold precursor in the presence
of the PEG diacid polymer, with a complete reduction of metal ions
confirming the formation of hybrid nanoparticles in the solution.
The as-prepared Cu0–AuNPs solution was purified
by centrifugation and dialysis to remove excess of not-conjugated
dicarboxylic PEG.14

3.3 Synthesis
of L1@Cu2+–AuNPs
The synthesis of L1@Cu2+–AuNPs colloids is described
here. Twenty milliliters of HAuCl4 aqueous solution (2.5
× 10–4 M in water) was added to CuCl2 solution (5 mL, 6.10 × 10–5 M in water) under
stirring for 1 h. After this time, 5 mL of L1 (2.3 × 10–4 M in water) was mixed to this hybrid blend solution during 1 h,
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature. At the end of this
reaction, 250 μL of dicarboxylic PEG was mixed to the solution
and stirred for 1 h. Finally, 3.6 mL of aqueous 0.01 M NaBH4 was added at once until stabilization and reduction to hybrid nanoparticles.
The “as-prepared” L1@Cu2+–AuNPs solution
was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min for three times and then the
supernatant was discarded. This was repeated twice to remove excess
of not-conjugated reagents. L1@Cu2+–AuNPs were stored
at 8 °C and characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.

3.4 Physicochemical
Characterization
All the measurements were performed in triplicate
to validate the
reproducibility of the synthetic and analytical procedures.15,16

3.4.1 UV–Vis Measurements
Absorption
spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda UV/Vis 950 spectrophotometer
in plastic cuvettes with an optical path of 10 mm. The wavelength
range was 200–900 nm.

3.4.2 Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Size and morphology of NPs were
characterized by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (JEM-1011 TEM, Jeol, Inc., Peabody, MA) using a Morada
CCD camera at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.

3.4.3 Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman experiments
have been performed on an Xplora spectrometer (Horiba Scientifics-France).15,16

3.4.5 Optical Imaging
The optical images
of the cells were carried out as previously reported.17

3.4.6 Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS)
The size measurements were performed using a Zetasizer
Nano ZS (Malvern
Instruments, Malvern, U.K.) equipped with a He–Ne laser (633
nm, fixed scattering angle of 173°) at room temperature.

3.4.7 ζ-Potential Measurements
The ζ-potential
of AuNPs dispersed in water was measured using
the electrophoretic mode of a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments
Ltd, U.K.).

3.5 ES Cells Culture Conditions
Embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) can be used as a model system in basic research,
drug discovery, biomedical applications, and nanotechnology because
they combine the potential of unlimited self-renewal with the ability
to differentiate into a wide range of tissue-specific cells. The present
study was designed to determine if the nanoparticles Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs could have toxic
effects on undifferentiated and neural differentiated ES cells. Wild-type
mouse AK7 ES cells were maintained in an undifferentiated state by
culture on a monolayer of mitomycin-C-inactivated fibroblast in the
presence of leukemia-inhibiting factor as previously described.18 At 24 h before treatment, the cells were seeded
on gelatin-coated plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 to allow attachment.

3.5.1 In Vitro Neurons Differentiation
Neural progenies can be generated from ESC with high standards
of
accuracy and reliability. To induce neural differentiation, essentially
according to Fico et al.,18 AK7 ES cells
at 48 h before inducing differentiation were seeded on gelatin-coated
plates. At day 0, the ES cells were dissociated in a single-cell suspension
and 1500 cells/cm2 were plated on gelatin-coated plates.
The cells were maintained in differentiation medium until day 7 when
neural precursors cells were detached using 0.05% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid solution and frozen in 90% FBS + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Frozen
cells were thawed and immediately plated at 66 000 cells/cm2 in Matrigel-coated plates. The medium was changed every day
until day 13.

3.6 Cell Death Assay
The lethal dose
50 (LD50) is the amount of a chemical, calculated as the concentration
of chemicals that produces death in 50% of a cellular population.

To determine the lethal dose 50 (LD50) of the nanoparticles Cu0–AuNPs and L1@Cu2+–AuNPs on undifferentiated
ES and neural-derived ES cells, these cells were seeded, respectively,
on gelatin-coated or Matrigel-coated plates. The cells were untreated
or treated with different concentrations (0–1000 nM) of Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2+–AuNPs nanoparticles
for 24 h, then collected, counted, and analyzed for their ability
to incorporate the cell-permeable dye trypan blue. Concomitantly,
other cells, untreated or treated in the same way, were visualized
by phase-contrast microscopy using the DMI6000B inverted fully automated
microscope with DFC 420 RGB camera (Leica Microsystems, Wetzelar,
Germany). Leica LAS V5.4 software was used for image acquisition/elaboration
(contrast/γ adjusting).

3.7 Immunofluorescence
Analysis
For nanoparticles
internalization experiments, neural-differentiated ESCs were seeded
in six-well plates and cultured for 24 h. Cu0–AuNPs
or L1@Cu2+–AuNPs conjugated with Alexa-Fluor-594,
suspended in culture medium at 200 nM, were incubated with cells for
24 h. After the incubation, the cells were rinsed twice in PBS to
remove the noninternalized nanoparticles, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min, and washed in PBS 1×. After washing, the cells were
incubated with WGA-488 (Invitrogen) as membrane marker following manufacturer’s
instructions. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen).
Fluorescent labeling was visualized using the inverted fully automated
confocal Nikon AR-1 microscope. The NIS elements software was used
for image acquisition/elaboration.

4 Conclusions
Designing hybrid functional nanoparticles for biomedical applications
is still a current challenge in terms of performances, stability,
and safety in biological media. In particular, if gold nanoparticles
are known for their high in vivo inertness and their use in several
applications, including their photophysical properties, the use of
copper(II) into the hybrid nanoparticles is still not a trivial task.
Once copper is inside the metallic aggregates, it is usual to obtain
unstable and/or cytotoxic effects coming from the hybrid nanostructure.

The success of this study was then to provide the design, the synthesis,
and the characterization of new potential nanocomplexes based on the
incorporation of chelated copper(II) in gold nanoparticles. Highly
thermodynamically stable and kinetically and electrochemically inert
copper(II) chelates have been used based on a proven cyclam cross-bridged
ligand, the cb-te1pa chelator. Its insertion was facilitated by the
presence of aniline moiety, a carboxylic function, and its overall
charge and proved all along the nanomaterials characterization. In
conclusion, from the results obtained, there is evidence of a type-selective
difference in NP toxicity in favor of L1@Cu2–AuNPs.
Possible reason to explain nanoparticle-specific uptake and distribution
inside the neural-derived ES cells may be attributed to the peculiar
features of Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2–AuNPs
nanoparticles. Our results indicated that the differences between
Cu0–AuNPs or L1@Cu2–AuNPs nanoparticles
as well as the target cell type are critical determinants of intracellular
responses and degree of cytotoxicity. These results allow us to hypothesize
that the apoptosis is the predominant death pathway for moderate concentrations
of NPs in the solution, whereas necrosis is the predominant pathway
for high concentrations of NPs.

Toxicity comparison with respect
to previously reported results
in literature is not straightforward because ES neuron cells are not
very commonly diffused in many laboratories; nevertheless, the synthetized
Cu-based NPs showed LD levels of the same order of those mentioned
in critical review study, recently published.35
