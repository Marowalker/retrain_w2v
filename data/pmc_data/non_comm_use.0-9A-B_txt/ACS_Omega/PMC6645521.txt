Rheological characteristics
of a concentrated suspension can be
tuned using anisotropic particles having various shapes and sizes.
Here, the role of anisotropic nanoparticles, such as surface-functionalized
multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and graphene oxide nanoplatelets
(GONPs), on the rheological behavior of fumed silica suspensions in
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is investigated. In these mixed-particle
suspensions, the concentrations of MWNTs and GONPs are much lower
than the fumed silica concentration. The suspensions are stable, and
hydrogen-bonded PEG solvation layers around the particles inhibit
their flocculation. Fumed silica suspensions over the concentration
range considered here display shear-thickening behavior. However,
for a larger concentration of MWNTs and with increasing aspect ratios,
the shear-thickening behavior diminishes. In contrast, a distinct
shear-thickening response has been observed for the GONP-containing
suspensions for similar mass fractions (MFs) of MWNTs. For these suspensions,
shear thickening is achieved at a lower solid MFs compared to the
suspensions consisting of only fumed silica. A significant weight
reduction of shear-thickening fluids that can be achieved by this
approach is beneficial for many applications. Our results provide
guiding principles for controlling the rheological behavior of mixed-particle
systems relevant in many fields.

Introduction
Concentrated suspensions
are found in consumer products and in
many manufacturing processes.1,2 The flow behavior of
these suspensions depends on factors such as size and shape of the
suspended particles, particle concentration and surface chemistry,
and the interaction between the particles and suspending media.3−6 All of these factors in combination dictate the rheological behavior
of the fluids, including shear rate-dependent viscosity behavior demonstrated
by shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses, yield stress, elasticity,
etc.7,8 In shear-thickening fluids (STFs), viscosity
increases abruptly beyond a critical shear rate (γ̇c).9,10 In drilling fluids, the shear-thickening
behavior is detrimental.11 In contrast,
such responses can be beneficially harnessed for applications including
the enhancement in ballistic and stab resistance of personal body
armor,12 vibration damping of skis and
tennis rackets,12 and spacecraft shielding.13

A number of earlier investigations on
STFs considered suspensions
of high-volume-fraction spherical silica particles.14−17 For STFs, as rationalized for
spherical particles, the viscosity increase beyond a critical shear
rate has been attributed to the formation of transient, stress-bearing
hydroclusters.9 Subjected to shear flow,
the particles in concentrated suspensions can come close together
as the suspending fluid between the particles is displaced. The hydrodynamic
force (Fhydrodynamic) between two particles
is inversely proportional to the separation distance between them,
for example, the hydrodynamic force between two spherical particles
of radius a separated by a distance h is . Here,
η0 is the viscosity
of the suspending media and γ̇ is the shear rate.14,18 On the other hand, the Brownian motion of the particles and the
repulsive forces caused by solvation layer compression as the particles
approach will deter the particles from coming closer together. At
γ̇c, the attractive and repulsive forces become
equal and multiple particles in closed orbits form hydroclusters.
Beyond γ̇c, the hydroclusters start to grow
and an increase in viscosity (shear-thickening) is observed.16,17,19 Hydrocluster formation has been
simulated9,20 and investigated experimentally.21−23 These studies predict that hydroclusters become oriented along the
shear plane’s compression axis.20,24 Both experimental
and simulation studies have also captured friction-induced clustering
of particles with rough surfaces.10,25,26 However, particles with solvation layers (as discussed
below) may not experience significant friction. Because the hydroclusters/clusters
are not bonded physically or chemically, they dissociate as the flow
is removed. Thus, the shear-thickening response is mostly reversible.16

Continuous, gradual shear thickening with
spherical particles can
be changed to discontinuous, rapid shear thickening through the addition
of low volume fractions of anisotropic particles.28−30 For example,
fractal fumed silica particles display distinct shear-thickening behavior
at a very low mass fraction (MF) of 0.05 in poly(propylene glycol).27 Mixing and processing of these lower-mass/volume-fraction
suspensions are relatively easy in comparison to high-volume-fraction
spherical particle suspensions. Lower solid content also results in
a significant mass reduction of STFs. Anisotropic particles with high
aspect ratios have also been considered, including multiwall carbon
nanotubes (MWNTs), acicular precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) particles,
rod-shaped silicon carbide whiskers, cubic aluminosilicate zeolite,
and carbon black/alumina suspensions.28−31 The aspect ratio of PCC was shown
to play no role on the critical shear stress for shear thickening
but affected the transition from continuous to discontinuous shear
thickening.29 Rheo-small angle neutron
scattering results indicated that flow-oriented
particle structure was mostly maintained throughout shearing. MWNTs
with larger aspect ratios than PCC display shear thickening in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone.29,30,32 These particles were
not surface-functionalized, so shear thickening was induced by flocculation
rather than by hydrocluster formation. Interestingly, the flocculated
fumed silica particles did not shear-thicken, but gel formation was
observed.33

Particle interactions
with the dispersing medium (mostly the secondary
bonding) is another important factor. For example, hydrophilic fumed
silica forms hydrogen bonds to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), resulting
in a well-dispersed, nonflocculating system, which is very stable.
The characteristic time scale for association and dissociation of
hydrogen bonding is faster than the deformation time scale. As the
particles come close, the entropic penalty associated with the solvation
layer compression plays an important role in shear thickening.14 Shear thickening of hydrophilic fumed silica
nanoparticles in ionic liquids and ionic structure effects on suspension
viscoelasticity have also been investigated experimentally.34 Such experiments revealed shear-thickening behavior
by hydrophilic ionic liquids, whereas gel formation occurred in hydrophobic
liquids, displaying shear thinning at high shear rates.

Mixed-particle
systems have been investigated to help in tailoring
shear-thickening responses. In these systems, the concentration of
primary particle is much higher than that of the other (secondary)
particle.35 Sha et al.36 showed that both nonfunctionalized graphene nanoplatelets
(GNPs) and MWNTs, when added as secondary particles, alter the shear-thickening
behavior of 75 wt % spherical (650 nm) silica nanoparticle PEG suspensions.
Adding either 1–3 wt % of GNPs or MWNTs to silica suspensions
resulted in lower critical shear rates for shear thickening versus
the suspensions with only silica particles. Another study revealed
that adding nonfunctionalized MWNTs to high-weight-fraction (∼44
wt %) fumed silica suspensions in PEG decreased viscosity and increased
critical shear rate,37 contrary to the
report by Sha et al.36 Non-surface-functionalized
MWNTs and GNPs can flocculate in polar PEG, so mixing those in suspensions
containing high MFs of silica can be a challenge. Stability of these
suspensions can also be poor due to the large silica particles and
the absence of hydrogen bonding between the particles and PEG.36,38 In another study, a surfactant was used to disperse MWNTs in a silica–ethylene
glycol suspension to obtain a stable suspension.38 Here, the silica particle content was high (∼64
wt %). These particles were of irregular shape with an average size
of 2 μm. The shear thickening improved with the addition of
MWNTs, although the concentration of nanotubes was low compared to
other reports and our current study.36,37 Nanotubes
were postulated to form a network, restricting the SiO2 particle motion, leading to shear thickening.38

Hydrocluster formation in a mixed-particle system
can depend on
the difference in shape between the primary and secondary particles
and on their size ratio. Hypothetically, to obtain maximum shear-thickening
behavior, the particles pack closely along the compression axis. Secondary
particles that are larger than the primary particles may not orient
along the compression axis and hinder hydrocluster formation. Results
from mixed-particle systems can also be compared to the bimodal suspensions
consisting of spherical particles with two different diameters. Increasing
the mass fraction of small particles relative to the larger particles
enhances shear thickening and increases the critical shear stress.35,39

In this study, MWNTs functionalized with surface-hydroxyl
functional
groups or graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GONPs) were added independently
into fumed silica suspensions in PEG. The goals were to elucidate
the effect of anisotropic carbon nanoparticles on the shear-thickening
behavior of concentrated suspensions and to examine the contradicting
results in the literature. The suspensions prepared here were well
dispersed and were stable over a prolonged duration versus those of
nonfunctionalized nanoparticles. Hydrogen bonding between the particles
and PEG stabilizes the suspensions. The onset and slope of shear thickening
strongly depend on the nanoparticles’ MF and shape. We have
shown that for the nanotube-containing suspensions the shear-thickening
behavior gradually disappeared with the increasing concentration of
nanotubes. In contrast, over the concentration range investigated
here, GONPs enhance the shear-thickening behavior of fumed silica
suspensions. We attempted to elucidate the mechanism behind such shear-thickening
behavior.

Our study was also motivated by the fact that carbon
nanoparticles
can alter the electrical and thermal transport properties of suspensions.
These important properties can be a function of the applied shear
rate and the corresponding structural evolution.38 Although investigations on the mixed-particle system are
not common, change of electrical conductivity in nanoparticle suspensions
has been widely reported.40,41 Improved understanding
of the flow behavior as investigated here can lead to a better control
of mixed-particle system transport properties. Potential applications
exist in multifunctional composites. Results from this study provide
new understanding regarding the rheological behavior of concentrated
suspensions of mixed-particle systems having applications in many
fields.

(S-MWNT) and long MWNTs (L-MWNT) in PEG 200. Sample compositions,

Characterization of Nanoparticles
GONPs were characterized using atomic force
microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TEM and AFM images
(Figures S1 and S2) show that the GONPs
have lateral dimensions in the range of 500 nm to 1 μm versus
thicknesses from 1.1 to 2.6 nm, signifying that only two to three
graphene layers are present in the GONPs. Considering width, W ≈ 500 nm, and thickness, T ≈
1.1–2.6 nm, the GONP aspect ratio ranges from ∼200 to
500. The interlayer spacing between graphene plates is representative
of the oxidation level.42,43 The XRD data (Figure S3) confirmed that the basal plane spacing
increased from graphite’s value of 0.34 to 0.93 nm for GONPs.42,43 XPS analysis of GONP samples determined the level of oxidation.44 Both low and curve-resolved high-resolution
(HR) spectra are shown in Figure S4. The
HR spectrum was deconvoluted to determine the existence of different
functional groups and their relative quantities. These synthesized
GONPs consist of about 51% oxidized carbon and 49% graphitic carbon
with the following order of abundance of oxygen functional groups
C=O > C–O > O–C=O (Figure S4).

The TEM image (Figure 1a) of A200 silica exhibits loosely interconnected
branched aggregates of ∼12 nm diameter primary particles fused
together in fractal structures (100–200 nm), as previously
reported.45,46 The surface area of A200 silica is ∼200
m2/g.45 This surface is covered
with both isolated and bridged silanol groups with densities of ∼1.15
and ∼1.5 nm–2, respectively.46

Figure 1 TEM images of (a) A200 silica, (b) S-MWNTs and A200 silica, and
(c) GONPs and A200 silica. The PEG suspensions were diluted with ethanol
and dried before TEM experiments. The samples may contain a small
amount of residual PEG.

S-MWNTs with lengths of 0.5–2 μm and L-MWNTs
with
lengths of 10–30 μm were used in this study. Both types
of MWNTs had outer and inner diameters (D) of 10–20
nm and 3–5 nm, respectively. The aspect ratios (L/D) for the MWNTs varied from 25 to 200 for the
short tubes and from 500 to 3000 for the long tubes. The supplier-provided
specific surface area is 233 m2/g for the MWNT samples.
Using a 3–4 wt % OH content in these MWNTs (provided by the
supplier), the OH group surface density was estimated to be ∼4.56
nm–2. Furthermore, on the basis of the dimensions
of GONPs, we have estimated the surface area to be ∼500 m2/g.47,48 Short nanotubes (0.015 MF) intermingled
with silica surfaces (0.15 MF) are shown in Figure 1b. In contrast, evidence of silica particle
aggregation on GONP surfaces likely due to hydrogen bonding between
GONPs and fumed silica as ethanol dried during sample preparation
can be seen in Figure 1c (also see Figure S5). During high-shear
mixing, the particles become well dispersed in PEG 200. These suspensions
are stable for a prolonged duration, and no phase separation has been
observed for weeks in stored samples.

Molecular Interactions
The surface chemistry of these
MWNTs and GONPs plays a significant role on the rheological responses
due to their large surface areas. The hydroxyl group surface density
on the MWNTs (∼4.56 nm–2) is approximately
twice that of the silanol groups on A200 silica. Similarly, the hydroxyl,
ketone, epoxy, and carboxylic group surface densities on the GONPs
are ∼5.33 nm–2. These functions can readily
hydrogen-bond to the silanol groups on A200 silica surfaces and to
the ether and terminated hydroxyl groups of PEG.

Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibited OH stretching of PEG at 3411 cm–1, which shifted toward lower wavenumbers of 3400,
3399, and 3396 with the addition of fumed silica, GONPs, and S-MWNTs,
respectively. This confirmed enhanced hydrogen bonding occurred between
PEG and silanol groups of fumed silica and/or surface functional groups
(carboxylic/hydroxyl/ether) of nanoparticles (Figure S6). Hydrogen bonding between PEG and silanol groups
of fumed silica particles has also been reported in the literature
as the peak at ∼3400 cm–1 shifts toward lower
wavenumbers.49 Hydrogen-bonded PEG around
the particles results in a solvation layer around the particles. Without
this solvation layer, flocculation of silica nanoparticles can take
place, as observed in a system where the PEG molecules were end-capped
with methyl groups.33,49 A PEG solvation layer also hinders
nanotube and GONP flocculation similar to fumed silica, i.e., the
nanoparticles will not undergo significant hydrogen bonding within
themselves, which promotes aggregation or flocculation. The fully
stretched length of PEG 200 is ∼1.8 nm; therefore, the minimum
thickness of the solvated layer can be considered to be of the same
order.14

Rheological Investigations
The effect of suspended
particle shape and size on rheological responses was investigated
by examining the steady shear and dynamic rheology of PEG suspensions
containing MWNTs and GONPs. Figure 2a displays the Newtonian behavior of neat PEG over
the shear rates of 1–1000 s–1. The results
below the shear rate of 1 s–1 could not be captured
due to the lower limit of the measurable torque in our instrument.
In addition to PEG 200, results for the suspensions in PEG 200 of
L-MWNT (0.015 MF), S-MWNT (0.02 MF), and GONPs (0.02 MF) are displayed
in Figure 2a. These
MFs correspond to the maximum nanoparticle MFs considered because
a good mixing of MWNTs into silica suspensions cannot be achieved
above these MFs. Adding MWNTs and GONPs to PEG increased the viscosity.
This increase is a function of MF (see below).

vs shear rate. (b) Elastic (G′) and loss (G″) moduli as a function of strain amplitude. (c)
Determination of yield stresses. The lines are for visual guidance.

All viscosity versus shear rate
responses for these nanoparticle
suspensions display high viscosities at low shear rates, followed
by decreasing viscosities as shear rates rise (Figure 2a). However, the viscosity drop for the MWNT
suspensions was not continuous. A small plateau or change in slope
was observed at intermediate shear rates. For example, for 0.02 MF
of S-MWNT, shear thinning was observed from 0.1 to 0.3 s–1. At intermediate shear rates of 0.3–0.6 s–1, the S-MWNT suspension viscosity became almost constant and then
it continued to decrease above the shear rate of 0.6 s–1. The viscosity almost plateaued beyond the shear rate of 100 s–1. The low shear (0.1 s–1) viscosity
of 0.015 MF of L-MWNT is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of
0.02 MF of S-MWNT. With increasing shear rate, the viscosity of 0.015
MF of L-MWNT decreased but remained higher than that of the other
samples. Shear thinning was observed for the GONP suspension with
a decreasing slope, becoming almost constant above a shear rate of
500 s–1. The low shear viscosity for the S-MWNT
suspension was found to be slightly higher than that for the same
MF of GONPs; however, the high-shear-rate values were similar.

Figure 2b represents
storage moduli (G′) and loss moduli (G″) for the same suspensions as a function of applied
strain amplitude. PEG 200’s very low moduli could not be captured
because of measurement limitation of our rheometer. The nature of
suspended particles plays a role in the dynamic rheology responses
similar to steady shear rheology results. At low strain amplitude,
both G′ and G″ were
independent of the applied strain amplitude in the linear viscoelastic
region (LVE) for all samples. However, a decrease in G′ and G″ was observed beyond a critical
strain, i.e., the samples strain-soften. In general, in the LVE region, G′ was almost an order of magnitude higher than G″ for both L- and S-MWNT suspensions. At higher
strain values, a crossover was observed, where G″
became higher than G′. The low strain modulus
for the L-MWNT suspension was larger than that of the S-MWNT suspension.
For the GONP suspension, G′ is slightly higher
than G″ in the LVE region. Interestingly,
the critical strain corresponding to crossover (strain-softening behavior)
was lower for S-MWNT and L-MWNT than for GONP suspensions. The yield
stress values are 30, 4, and 1.4 Pa for L-MWNT, S-MWNT, and GONP suspensions,
respectively (Figure 2c).

At low strain for the nanotube suspensions, G′
> G″, indicating a soft solidlike behavior
(Figure 2b). This is
likely due to temporary network formation caused by nanotube entanglement
or topological constraints. Similar network structures have been reported
for SWNTs in high-molecular-weight PEG and MWNTs in low-molecular-mass
polyisobutylene.50−52 The temporary network structure dissociates at higher
stress/strain, as displayed by the yield stress. A higher yield stress
in long tube suspensions versus short tubes indicates a stronger network
structure in the former. As the structure yields at higher strain
amplitude, the viscous response exceeds the elastic response.

Interestingly, the viscosity versus shear rate data of MWNT suspensions
(Figure 2a), particularly,
at high MF, has some resemblance to the viscosity behavior of nematic
liquid crystalline materials, i.e., three regions in viscosity versus
shear rate curves.2,53,54 For 0.02 MF S-MWNT and 0.015 MF L-MWNT suspensions, the rod number
densities (υ) are ≈2.9 × 1013 and 1.4
× 1012 cm–3, respectively; υ
is of the same order of  cm–3 for S-MWNTs
and
more than ≈1.25 × 1011 cm–3 for L-MWNTs. Here, L and d are
the average tube length and diameter, respectively. On the basis of
Doi’s theory, the formation of a nematic liquid crystalline
state is expected at this concentration.2 However, the 0.02 MF S-MWNT suspension did not display clear birefringent
domains under cross-polar microscopy, which is typical for liquid
crystals. Nanotubes in our samples have not been highly purified and
have significant polydispersity. In addition, a small amount of agglomerates
of nanotubes can be present in the sample. Therefore, polydispersity
and agglomeration, if any, likely have hindered the formation of a
liquid crystalline phase,55 although the
rheological response has some signature of liquid crystalline materials.
Formation of a flow-induced nematic phase from an entangled state
of nanotubes under quiescent condition, as observed for MWNTs in polyisobutylene,50 is a possibility. However, in this study, we
have not investigated the structural evolution during flow.50

The GONP samples did not display birefringence
domains, except
at small regions.55 Therefore, the GONP
samples are mostly isotropic, in comparison to the liquid crystalline
behavior of aqueous suspensions of GONPs or suspensions of many other
two-dimensional particles.56−59 A small degree of shear-thinning behavior was observed
(Figure 2a) similar
to that observed for GONP water suspensions.60

As described previously, PEG-containing nanoparticles displayed
interesting rheological behavior. Next, the effects of added nanoparticles
on the rheology of silica suspensions were investigated and compared
to the results for suspensions containing only fumed silica in PEG.14Figure 3a,b displays the viscosity versus shear rate plots of 0.15
MF silica suspensions containing different MFs of S-MWNT and L-MWNT,
respectively. The increase in viscosity associated with the addition
of S-MWNTs (Figure 3a) is slightly lower than that with L-MWNTs (Figure 3b) for the same concentration. As the shear
rate increased, the viscosity dropped initially in both cases. Shear
thinning becomes prominent with increasing nanotube concentrations
and larger tube aspect ratios (i.e., L-MWNTs). The slope of the shear-thinning
region changed from ≈−0.44 to −0.92 as the MF
of S-MWNT rose from 0.002 to 0.02.

Figure 3 Shear and dynamic rheology results with
the addition of MWNTs in
a 0.15 MF fumed silica suspension in PEG. Steady shear results for
(a) S-MWNT and (b) L-MWNT. Dynamic moduli for (c) S-MWNT and (d) L-MWCNT.
The lines are for visual guidance. For clarity, every fourth data
point is shown (complete data set is plotted in Figure S11).

For S-MWNT suspensions (Figure 3a), initial shear thinning was followed by
a small
extent of shear thickening. This viscosity rise was clearly observed
at low nanotube MFs, whereas the viscosity increase was not significant
for the highest S-MWNT MF. The slope of the viscosity versus shear
stress curve during the shear thickening can distinguish continuous
versus discontinuous shear thickening, where a slope greater than
1 indicates discontinuous thickening.10 Our samples demonstrate continuous shear thickening (Figure S7).

The degree of shear thickening
was reduced by longer nanotubes
(Figure 3b). L-MWNT
samples did not display significant shear thickening. A small viscosity
rise was only observed at ∼0.002 MF (Figure 3b). Moreover, the increased viscosity could
only be captured until the samples are ejected from the geometry causing
a drastic viscosity drop (see dotted lines).

Figure 3c,d displays
the dynamic rheological responses of silica suspensions in PEG-containing
S-MWNTs and L-MWNTs, respectively. Silica in PEG without nanotubes
exhibited a liquidlike behavior with G″ > G′. Both G′ and G″ increased with MWNT addition to silica suspensions. The
dynamic moduli (G′, G″)
are lower for fumed silica/MWNT/PEG suspensions than for MWNT/PEG
suspensions. The difference between G′ and G″ decreased in the LVE region, and ultimately G′ > G″. For a given MWNT
MF, the moduli decreased beyond a critical strain and a crossover
between G′ and G″
occurred similar to MWNT-containing silica suspensions. This was particularly
true for the samples containing L-MWNTs with fumed silica, at the
highest MF. This decrease can be due to the disruption of the temporary
network formation in nanotube suspensions.

Steady and dynamic
rheological experiments on GONP suspensions
with silica were performed to further analyze the effect of particle
shapes on rheological behavior. Figure 4a displays the viscosity increase with addition of
GONPs. For a given shear rate, the viscosity increased with the increasing
amount of GONPs. The increase in viscosity is most pronounced at the
GONP MF of 0.02, where the viscosity was about 1 order of magnitude
greater than that for the fumed silica suspension at a 0.2 s–1 shear rate. The GONP suspensions initially shear-thinned, prior
to shear thickening. Adding GONP MFs of 0.01 and 0.02 decreased the
critical shear rates of the fumed silica suspension from 80 s–1 to 30 and 20 s–1, respectively.
Both G′ and G″ values
increased with increasing GONP concentration (Figure 4b). G′ and G″ became similar in the LVE region for
a 0.02 GONP MF, indicating viscoelastic fluidlike behavior. In contrast, G′ was higher than G″ for
samples with nanotubes added to 0.15 MF fumed silica (Figure 3c).

every fourth data point is shown (complete data set is plotted in Figure S12).

The fumed silica suspension’s shear-thickening process
can
be explained by considering the formation of shear-induced hydroclusters.
MWNTs or GONPs in fumed silica suspensions influence rheological responses
and hydrocluster formation. Nanotubes disentangle and start to orient
in the flow direction with increasing shear rates.50,58,59 The nanotube orientation in these suspensions
depends on the flow strength, the large persistence lengths of nanotubes,61 and nanotube concentrations because their motion
can be hindered in a crowded environment consisting of fumed silica
and nanotubes. During nanotube orientational changes, portions of
one nanotube can come into proximity with another nanotube. However,
it is unlikely that multiple nanotubes will occupy close orbits forming
hydroclusters. The PEG solvation layer also deters nanotube flocculations,
as seen in some previous nanotube suspension studies, where shear
thickening caused by flocculation was observed.32 Additionally, nanotubes can hinder hydrocluster formation
by fumed silica particles themselves. Thus, shear thickening became
less pronounced with increasing nanotube concentration. A possible
structural change during this process is shown in Figure 5a,b.

Suspensions of GONPs with fumed silica shear-thicken. The
GONPs
are platelike particles with lateral dimensions similar to S-MWNTs
but smaller than L-MWNTs. Unlike nanotubes, nanoplatelets cannot entangle,
as manifested by their mostly viscoelastic fluidlike behavior, captured
in their dynamic rheology (Figure 4b). The GONPs’ large surface area causes orientation
in the flow direction trapping fumed silica particles between the
platelets (Figure 5c,d). This can promote hydrocluster formation beyond γ̇c. Thus, shear thickening was observed for these suspensions
at lower γ̇c.

The flow-history effect
on sample microstructure and shear-thickening
responses were analyzed by performing a sequence of rheology tests
on 0.01 MF S-MWNT with 0.15 MF fumed silica samples. Strain sweep,
flow sweep, and time sweep results appear in Figure 6. Strain sweep was initially conducted (step
#1), showing G′ > G″
in the LVE region, indicating a soft solidlike behavior. After conditioning
(step #2), flow sweep (step #3) and strain sweep (step #4) were conducted.
Interestingly, strain sweep (step #4) displayed a liquidlike behavior,
as evident from G″ > G′,
indicating the structure changed during the flow sweep. The nanotubes
may have disentangled (resulting in a drop of G′)
and oriented during flow sweep. This sample was then relaxed for about
60 min, and increases in G′ and G″ during relaxation were captured using a time sweep (step
#5) where, G″ is still greater than G′. Strain sweep (step #6) was performed after relaxation,
causing a viscoelastic liquidlike behavior and a smaller gap between G′ and G″. Time sweep (step
#7) was conducted to allow further relaxation. Finally, shear thickening
was captured next during flow sweep (step #8). These results (step
#8) are different from those in first flow sweep (Figure S8). The nanotubes possibly lose their orientational
order and start to entangle again during relaxation. Although a plateau
was observed in the relaxation experiments, the structure did not
fully recover its initial structure. A similar experiment was performed
on only 0.15 MF fumed silica in PEG (Figure S9). We also compared the extent of shear thickening with step #8.
The change in viscosity captured after the relaxation time exhibited
a similar extent of shear thickening (Figure S10). However, the shear thickening in the nanotube-containing suspension
is less pronounced than the one observed in fumed silica suspension
(Figure S8).

silica suspension. (a) Elastic and loss modulus vs strain amplitude,
(b) viscosity vs shear rate, and (c) elastic and loss moduli vs time.
The lines are for visual guidance. For clarity, every fourth data
point is shown (complete data set is plotted in Figure S13).

The above results indicate that subjected shear flow, the
entangled network-like structure
is broken and nanotubes may have a flow-oriented structure. However,
the shear-thickening process is mostly dictated by the fumed silica.
To understand the effect of fumed silica on suspension rheological
properties, flow sweep and strain sweep experiments were run on a
constant S-MWNT MF of 0.01 and on two additional fumed silica MFs
of 0.075 and 0.225. As the fumed silica MF rises from 0.075 to 0.225,
the viscosity increased (∼1 order of magnitude) over the whole
shear-rate range (Figure 7a). Adding S-MWNTs had a larger effect on the low shear viscosity
increase. For example, for the shear rate of 0.1 s–1, the viscosity for a 0.075 MF of fumed silica is around 0.4 Pa s.
This increased to about 100 Pa s upon adding a 0.01 MF S-MWNT. A steeper
shear thinning and a greater extent of shear thickening were observed
at the higher fumed silica MF of 0.225. However, the addition of S-MWNT
hindered the shear-thickening process. This confirmed that S-MWNTs
restrained shear thickening and hydrocluster growth even at higher
fumed silica content. Strain sweep experiments on fumed silica suspensions
(Figure 7b) displayed G″ higher than G′, indicating
liquidlike behavior. G′ became greater than G″ upon adding S-MWNTs. The elastic moduli of fumed
silica suspensions with S-MWNTs did not change significantly by raising
the fumed silica MF from 0.15 to 0.225. However, a slight increase
in G″ occurred with higher fumed silica contents,
confirming that fumed silica did not play a crucial role in system
elasticity.

S-MWNT and fumed silica. (a) Steady shear viscosity vs shear rate,
(b) elastic (G′) and loss (G″) as a function of strain amplitude. The lines are for visual
guidance. For clarity, every fourth data point is shown (complete
data set is plotted in Figure S14).

Incorporation of anisotropic particles
with high aspect ratios
in fumed silica suspensions allows precise control of viscosity under
shear. It is important to assess whether adding nanoparticles is beneficial
in obtaining a similar behavior with lowering solid content. The 0.225
MF fumed silica suspension results here were compared with a suspension
containing a 0.15 MF fumed silica and 0.02 MF GONP (Figure 8). A higher initial shear viscosity
was observed upon addition of 0.02 GONP MF to 0.15 MF fumed silica
in comparison to only 0.225 MF fumed silica in PEG. As the shear rate
increased, the viscosity dropped for both samples. GONP addition decreased
the critical shear rate from 100 to 10 s–1 compared
to the suspension with 0.225 MF fumed silica. This signifies the important
effect of GONPs in the preparation of lightweight shear-thickening
fluids. However, the GONP concentration may not be increased without
limits because gel formation can occur at higher concentrations, as
reported for GONP suspensions in water.62

vs shear rate for 0.225 MF of fumed silica in PEG, and
0.02 MF GONPs in 0.15 MF fumed silica in PEG. For clarity, every third
data point is shown (complete data set is plotted in Figure S15).

Although GONP addition caused shear thickening, the addition
of
nanotubes did not induce this effect. We believe that MWNTs with higher
flexibilities form entangled structures and prevent hydrocluster growth
subjected to shear flow. Shear thickening can be enhanced by using
shorter tubes without entanglements. It is also worth exploring the
incorporation of stiffer tubes to tune the dynamic and steady flow
behavior of fumed silica suspensions. We also anticipate that our
results will be valid for any suspensions, including mixed-particle
suspensions, where the suspended particles can form hydrogen bonding
with the suspending media. In addition, we speculate that nanotubes
suspended with the aid of surfactants in nonpolar solvents will also
show shear-thickening behavior.

Conclusions
In
this study, the effect of surface-functionalized MWNTs and GONPs
on the rheological behavior of fumed silica suspensions was investigated.
The functional groups on these particles form hydrogen bond with PEG,
resulting in stable suspensions. Addition of MWNTs and GONPs in fumed
silica suspensions increased the viscosity and elastic moduli of the
suspensions. For the MWNT suspensions, the elastic modulus was found
to be higher than the loss modulus at low strain, i.e., the samples
behave like soft solids. Such elastic behavior is attributed to the
entangled network structure of nanotubes. Fumed silica suspensions
when subjected to shear flow display a shear-thickening behavior beyond
a critical shear rate. However, for the nanotube suspensions, the
shear-thickening behavior disappeared with increasing concentration
of nanotubes, likely because of difficulty in forming hydroclusters.
In contrast, GONPs enhance the shear-thickening behavior. Adding only
a 0.02 MF GONP into a 0.15 MF fumed silica decreased the critical
shear rate from 100 to 10 s–1 in comparison to a
0.225 MF fumed silica suspension. The GONPs’ large surface
area causes trapping of fumed silica particles between the platelets
and the formation of hydroclusters. Our results indicate that the
rheological behavior of dense, mixed-particle suspensions can be tailored
by changing the concentration and the aspect ratios of the suspended
particles.

Materials and Methods
Aerosil 200 silica or A200 (Evonik
Industries), two types of MWNTs
(Cheap Tube Inc.) with different lengths, 0.5–2 and 10–30
μm, respectively, but of the same diameter (outer diameter,
10–20 nm) were used. These tubes are defined as short MWNTs
(S-MWNTs) and long MWNTs (L-MWNTs), respectively. GONPs were synthesized
using exfoliated graphite provided by Asbury Carbons (CAS #7782-42-5,
grade 3806). An improved Hummers’ method was used for GONP
synthesis.43 Hydroxy-terminated poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG), with an average molecular weight of 200 (PEG 200),
was purchased from Fisher Scientific and used as received.

Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were utilized to characterize the
nanoparticles. A JEOL 2100 200 kV microscope captured the TEM images.
Dilute GONPs in water were deposited on 300 mesh formvar lacey carbon-coated
copper grids for TEM experiments. TEM was also used to
study the suspensions consisting of fumed silica only and fumed silica
and MWNTs/GONPs suspended in PEG 200. Here, the suspension of interest
was diluted with ethanol, deposited on carbon-coated copper grids.
Ethanol was removed under vacuum for 2 h before TEM experiments. A
Dimension Icon atomic force microscope (Bruker Corporation) was used
for AFM imaging. A drop of a dilute GONP water solution was deposited
on a glass substrate and dried before each AFM experiment. A silicon
nitride probe with a spring constant of 3 N/m was used.

X-ray
diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried out with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 2θ range of 5–50°.
The GONPs’ degree of oxidation was characterized using a K-α
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an
Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The survey and high-resolution
(HR) spectra were taken at pass energies of 200 and 40 eV.

Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry experiments were
conducted using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific
Co). All experiments were conducted in transmission mode, and each
spectrum was captured from 600 to 4000 cm–1 by averaging
32 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Sample Preparation
Initially, nanotube/PEG samples
were sonicated using a tip sonicator (Fisher Scientific, CL-334) at
80 W for 15 min. A200 silica was then mixed into that suspension using
a high-shear mixer (Silverson L4RT-A) at 6000 rpm for 40 min, giving
homogeneous suspensions. Air bubbles were removed by vacuum degassing
for 12 h. Samples with GONPs were prepared by this same procedure,
except that a bath sonicator (Bransonic CPX1800H) was used for 4 h
instead of the tip sonicator. All samples had a 0.15 MF of A200 silica
if not indicated otherwise. The MFs of MWNTs, GONPs, and PEG were
calculated by considering constant total mass. The true densities
of A200 silica, MWNT, and GONP are 2.22, 2.1, and 2.26 g/mL, respectively.

Rheological Experiments
Steady and dynamic shear rheology
experiments were performed using a TA Instruments Discovery Hybrid
2 rheometer with 40 mm parallel plates at 20 °C. The gap was
maintained at 1 mm. Strain sweep experiments were performed by varying
the strain amplitude from 0.1 to 1000% at a frequency of 1 rad/s.
Flow sweep experiments were performed at the shear rates of 0.1–1000
s–1. A 60 s preshear step at a shear rate of 1 s–1 was applied before the flow sweep tests. All experiments
were repeated at least three times on two different sample batches
(six total repeats). The error bars on the rheological results indicate
one standard deviation. For the same batch, the experimental variation
was very small, but the variation was as high as 20% between two different
batches.
