Based on a SERS study,
the plasmon-assisted coupling reaction of p-iodoaniline
(PIAN) to p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
was investigated. This model plasmon-assisted
reaction exhibits an outstanding SERS performance with the limit of
detection as low as 10–13 M. Under low concentrations,
the control of the cis–trans isomerization of p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
was achieved by characterizing the Raman peak intensity at 1432 cm–1 of the coupling reaction catalytic product. We present
the regulation strategy for the isomerization of azobenzene derivatives
enabled here, through the controlled adjustment of reactant concentration,
and expand the application of SERS technique.

1 Introduction
Azobenzene, as an important
precursor in a chemical reaction, is
used in the manufacture of commercial materials, including biphenyl
dyes, rubber accelerators, etc. By introducing an azobenzene group
into the polymer, the novel physicochemical properties can be realized.
The isomerization of azobenzene, as a photochemical reaction converting
azobenzene between the cis–trans structures1 and can occur even in the
crystalline phase,2 has great effects on
its potential application fields of optical information storage materials,
nonlinear optical materials, liquid crystal materials, and biomolecular
active light control. As such, the biological photoswitches have been
proven to be regulated by the isomerization of azobenzene.3−5 The control of the isomerization of azobenzene has also attracted
extensive attention. Previous studies have proven that the electric
field is an effective way to regulate the isomerization of azobenzene.6,7 This inspires us to take surface plasmon resonance (SPR)8,9 as an excitation source to control this isomerization process since
the plasmon effect can produce the enormous electromagnetic field
on the surface of the rough metal electrode, which is currently used
in enhancing the Raman signal in the surface enhancement Raman scattering
(SERS) study.10

SERS has been recognized
to be an effective method in investigating
the intermolecular interactions and monitoring plasmon-assisted reactions.11−15 Since the discovery of plasma-driven chemical reactions, there have
been numerous reports on its mechanism and influencing factors.16−18 Note that characterization of the isomerized structure of azobenzene
derivatives using the SERS technique has the advantages of fast response
time19−21 and 105–108 times enhanced
Raman signal intensity.22,23 Also, it has been proven
that the outstanding SERS performance exhibits high sensitivity with
the limit of detection as low as 10–9 M.24 Most importantly, the mapping technique in SERS
detection can be used to sweep multiple points in a randomly selected
region, which avoids the contingency of the experiment, improves the
experimental reproducibility, and provides an intuitive image in monitoring
this isomerization reaction process.25,26

2 Results And Discussion
Herein, we have selected p-iodoaniline (PIAN),
which will undergo plasmon-assisted coupling reactions when PIAN is
absorbed on silver nanoparticles (NPs) under the irradiation of laser.
Through regulating its concentration, the control of the isomerization
of p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
was achieved.27 As shown in Figure 1a, the surface roughness and
size of the SERS substrate, that is, Ag NPs, were characterized using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Clearly, the rough surface morphology
of Ag NPs is spherical, which is expected to provide a sufficiently
large number of “hot spots” for plasma-driven chemical
reactions and result in enough intensity of the surface plasmon resonance
effect. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (Figure 1b) shows that the
Ag NPs are ∼40 nm in size and the PIAN is well-absorbed on
the surface of Ag NPs, when the silver substrate was prepared by mixing
with this SERS probe molecule.

Figure 1 (a) SEM image of Ag NPs. (b) TEM image
of the Ag NP-absorbed p-iodoaniline molecule.

Previous studies have widely confirmed
that, when the p-aminothiophenol (PATP) molecule
adsorbed on the surface of the silver
electrode, the surface plasmon-assisted coupling reaction of PATP
to p,p′-dimercaptoazobenzene
(DMAB) can be realized.15,28,29 Three unusually strong signals at 1140, 1390, and 1432 cm–1 in the detected SERS spectrum should be attributed to the —N=N—
Raman characteristic peaks of the product DMAB. In our experiment,
the SERS mapping of 10–3 M PIAN and Ag NP mixed
solution was first performed, and hundreds of data points were collected
with a step size of 1 μm and laser power of 1%. The randomly
selected mapping scan rectangular area is expressed as red in Figure 2b. From the mapping
image demonstrating the Raman peak intensity corresponding to the
specific wavelength, shown in Figure 2c, it can be clearly and visually found that there
are obvious Raman peaks at 1140, 1390, and 1432 cm–1. This indicates that the surface plasmon-assisted coupling reaction
of PIAN underwent conversion to p,p′-diiodoazobenzene and the —N=N— bond
is formed since these three characteristic vibrational modes should
be attributed to those of the —N=N— bond in p,p′-diiodoazobenzene.30,31 Correspondingly, the three-dimensional Raman spectra of PIAN absorbed
on Ag NPs at all the sampling points are shown in Figure 2d. The signal intensities of
the Raman characteristic peaks at 1140 cm–1 can
reach 5.0 × 103, while the peaks at 1390 and 1432
cm–1 almost run up to 1.5 × 104.

spectra.

When we reduced the concentration
of PIAN to 10–9 M, the surface plasmon-assisted
coupling reaction from p-iodoaniline to p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
can occur. As can be seen from Figure 3, though the corresponding intensity becomes weaker
with the decrease in PIAN concentration, the characteristic Raman
vibrational modes of the —N=N— bond in the product p,p′-diiodoazobenzene all appear
the same. Note that the reduction in the signal intensity is different
from the three Raman peaks. In detail, the reduction at 1390 cm–1 is small, while the reduction at 1432 cm–1 is more significant. When the concentration of PIAN was further
reduced to 10–13 M, theoretically, this concentration
should be unreactive. Generally, the red area (high signal intensity)
at the corresponding wave number was significantly less, and it appeared
that not every point participated in the reaction at this concentration.
However, as shown in Figure 4, Raman peaks at 1140, 1390, and 1432 cm–1 at some monitoring data points can also be observed. Similarly,
the reduction at 1432 cm–1 is particularly notable,
as compared with that of 1390 cm–1.

Until now, the thing that deserves
our attention is, all as the
characteristic Raman vibrational modes of the —N=N—
bond in p,p′-diiodoazobenzene,
why is the peak intensity at 1432 cm–1 reduced more
obviously? One main explanation is possible: the cis–trans configuration conversion of the azobenzene
group in the product p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
occurs due to the change in PIAN concentration. For further investigation,
a series of PIAN concentrations were selected for SERS detecting,
and the characteristic Raman peak change was specifically characterized
in Figure 5. As can
be seen from Figure 5a, when the PIAN concentration is higher, the emergence of all the
three characteristic Raman peaks (1140, 1390, and 1432 cm–1) is quite obvious. This indicates that the surface plasmon-assisted
coupling reaction could be completely done under this concentration.
In addition, our theoretical calculation results reveal that the product,
that is, p,p′-diiodoazobenzene,
is the trans structure, which is consistent with
a previous study.32 The insets of the molecular
structures in Figure 5a correspond to its theoretically optimized structure of PIAN and p,p′-diiodoazobenzene using the
Gaussian 09 package. Furthermore, when the concentration of PIAN was
reduced to 10–7 M, as can be seen from Figure 5b, the three characteristic
Raman peaks remain. This coupling reaction could also be almost done
under this concentration, from the mapping images almost displaying
red in the selected sweep range (see the inset of Figure 5b), which originated from the
fact that the Raman characteristic peak signal intensity of the product p,p′-diiodoazobenzene at 1432 cm–1 is still strong. It should be noted that the peak
intensity at 1432 cm–1 is the most significantly
reduced in the three characteristic Raman peaks, which indicates that
the conversion of the azobenzene group from a trans to cis structure occurs. Because the previous study
has proven the fact that when the p,p′-diiodoazobenzene exists in its cis configuration,
the Raman peak intensity at 1432 cm–1 is weak, while
the peak intensity at 1390 cm–1 remains strong.31 This phenomenon becomes more and more obvious
with the decrease in PIAN concentration. Figure 5c,d again shows that the coupling reaction
can still be done, but not completely, under a very low concentration
of PIAN. However, in this condition, the reaction product gradually
turns into its cis structure of p,p′-diiodoazobenzene.

Figure 5 SERS signals of (a) 10–3 M, (b) 10–7 M, (c) 10–9 M, and (d) 10–11 M PIAN based on the Ag substrate
under the irradiation of 532 nm.
The insets in (a) correspond to the optimized structures of PIAN (bottom)
and p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
(top). The insets in (b)–(d) are the mapping images of the
Raman intensity at 1432 cm–1.

When the concentration of PIAN is low enough, the steric
hindrance
effect between the PIAN molecules will be counteracted. The special
π–π and n−π interactions take effect
between the azo group and benzene ring, causing the ring to distort
along the —N=N— bond.33 In detail, the π–π and n−π interactions
will involve the rupture of the N=N p-bond,
which facilitates the free rotation along the N–N bond and
results in the changes of the C–N–N–C dihedral
angle, with the N–N–C angle remains fixed at ∼120°.34 The ortho hydrogen of the benzene ring can also
be expected to interact with the lone pair electrons on the remote
nitrogen.35 All these factors facilitate
the formation of its cis structure of p,p′-diiodoazobenzene.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the conversion between
the cis–trans structures
of p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
can be induced by the concentration of the solution monitored using
the SERS technique. Under higher concentrations, the molecule is its trans structure, while with the decrease in concentration,
the cis–trans isomerization
takes place, and the cis structure of p,p′-diiodoazobenzene appears. Generally, the concentration regulation
and SERS characterization are very simple, which expands the application
of SERS in monitoring the isomerization process of the molecules by
characterizing the corresponding Raman peak changes.

4 Experimental and Computational Methods
In our experiment, p-iodoaniline (PIAN, 98%) and
sodium citrate analytical reagent (99%) were purchased from Sun Chemical
Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. A solution of 10–3–10–16 M PIAN was prepared using ethanol
(99.8%) as a solvent. The substrates for the SERS measurement were
prepared using sodium citrate to reduce silver nitrate.36 Different concentrations of the PIAN solution
were mixed with Ag NPs, dropped onto glass slides, and then dried
in air. The Raman spectra ranged from 894.33–1687.17 cm–1 (center, 1300.00 cm–1) using a
532 nm laser irradiation. Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed
using a Renishaw inVia spectrometer. The Raman spectral mapping technique
is an advanced semiautomatic technology that selects an area and automatically
scans hundreds of data points in this area into spectra, integrating
artificial color images based on the specified peak intensities. All
measurements were conducted using a 50 × 50 microscope objective
(a spot size of ∼2 μm), 532 nm excitation wavelength,
and laser power of 50%. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy
images were obtained using a Hitachi Su8010 field emission scanning
electron microscope (Japan) and a JEM-2100 ultrahigh resolution transmission
electron microscope (Japan), respectively. The ground-state geometries
of PIAN and p,p′-diiodoazobenzene
were optimized using the Gaussian 09 package37 with density functional theory (DFT), Becke′s three-parameter
hybrid exchange functional with Lee–Yang–Parr gradient-corrected
correlation (B3LYP functional), and def2-SVP basis set.
