Anchoring groups for dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs) play a
decisive role in high-power conversion efficiency (η) and long-term
cell durability. To date, a carboxylic acid is the most widely used
anchoring group for DSSCs. However, the carboxylic acid tends to dissociate
from a TiO2 surface during the cell operation as well as
in the presence of water. Considering that the dye dissociation from
TiO2 leads to a decrease in the cell performance, stable
anchoring groups are highly desirable to achieve long-term durability
of DSSCs toward their practical application. In this study, we designed
and synthesized a series of porphyrin dyes with the triethoxysilyl
anchoring groups, ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3, to evaluate the effects of the silicon-based anchoring
group on cell durability and photovoltaic properties. The DSSCs based
on ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 exhibited moderate η-values of 2.2, 4.7, and 2.3%, respectively.
It is noteworthy that the η-value of the DSSC based on ZnPSi2 (4.7%) is the highest among DSSCs based on porphyrin
dyes with silicon-based anchoring groups. The moderate η-values
are mainly attributed to the low charge collection efficiency originating
from the low surface coverage and plausible tilted geometry of the
dyes on TiO2. More importantly, we demonstrated that the
DSSC based on ZnPSi2 revealed higher long-term cell durability
under illumination than that based on reference porphyrin YD2-o-C8 having a conventional
carboxylic acid anchoring group.

Introduction
Excellent anchoring
groups to bind organic molecules and metal
complexes to metal oxides have been actively explored for heterogeneous
catalysts and photoelectrochemical cells, which are promising technologies
to solve the concern about increasing energy consumption and environmental
issues.1,2 In this regard, dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs), which consist of a dye-sensitized photoanode
(TiO2) and a counter electrode sandwiching a redox electrolyte,
have attracted significant attention as an alternative to conventional
silicon-based solar cells because of their low-cost production and
prospective power conversion efficiency (η).3−5 Since the pioneering
work by Grätzel et al. in 1991,6 various ruthenium complexes have been developed as the most efficient
dyes, achieving η-values more than 10%.7−11 In recent years, versatile organic dyes have also
been sought owing to the facile modulation of their structural, optical,
and electrochemical properties.12−19 Specifically, porphyrins are attractive dyes because of their intense
absorption at 400–450 and 550–600 nm, diverse molecular
design, and facile tuning of electronic structures.20−23 At the early stage of the development,
the η-values of typical porphyrin-based DSSCs had been lower
than those of ruthenium-based DSSCs as a consequence of their poor
absorption at 450–550 and >600 nm. Nevertheless, the introduction
of push–pull structures into porphyrins has enabled the porphyrin-based
DSSCs to achieve η-values more than 10% as a result of their
improved light-harvesting properties.24−34

To date, a carboxylic acid is the most widely used anchoring
group
for DSSCs because of its simple and straightforward synthesis and
sufficient binding ability to a TiO2 surface in organic
solvents. However, the carboxylic acid tends to dissociate from the
TiO2 surface during the cell operation under illumination
and in the presence of water. Considering that the dissociation of
the dye from the TiO2 surface leads to a decrease of the
cell performances, stable anchoring groups are highly desirable to
attain the long-term durability of the DSSCs toward their practical
application.35 In this context, phosphonic
acids are one of the most studied anchoring groups because of their
high stability on TiO2 even in aqueous solutions.36−40 Organic ligands such as salicylic acids,41−43 hydroxamic
acids,44 8-hydroxyquinolines,45,46 and tropolone47 have also been applied
to DSSC and have accomplished superior binding stability and comparable
η-values to those of the DSSCs based on the corresponding dyes
with the carboxylic acid anchoring group. Meanwhile, silanes are fascinating
anchoring groups because the Si–O–Ti bonds display a
higher binding ability to TiO2 than phosphonic acids.48−50 Notably, Hanaya and co-workers reported that the D−π–A
organic dye with a trimethoxysilyl anchoring group exhibited high
η-values of the DSSC as well as robust binding stability on
TiO2.51−54 Gust and co-workers also reported that the porphyrin dye with a
silatrane anchoring group showed high binding stability on TiO2.55 However, the η-value
of the DSSC was less than 1% as a result of insufficient light-harvesting
ability. Thus, we envisaged that we would be able to improve the η-value
and long-term durability of the DSSCs by the use of robust silicon-based
anchoring groups in push–pull porphyrins with excellent light-harvesting
ability. With this in mind, we chose a representative porphyrin sensitizer, YD2-o-C8, with
the push–pull structure as the motif to demonstrate the utility
of silicon-based anchoring groups. Herein, we designed and synthesized
a series of porphyrin dyes with the triethoxysilyl anchoring groups, ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 (Figure 1). We examined the
effect of the silicon-based anchoring group on their photovoltaic
properties and long-term durability of the DSSCs.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The synthetic schemes of the porphyrins with the triethoxysilyl anchoring groups, ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3, are
illustrated in Scheme 1. Precursor 1 and YD2-o-C8 were synthesized according to the literature.26 First, treatment of 1 with lithium
diisopropylamide and the subsequent reaction with chlorotriethoxysilane
afforded ZnPSi1 in high yield (84%). For ZnPSi2, Sonogashira coupling of 1 and 1,4-diiodobenzene gave
the porphyrin intermediate, 2, in 63% yield. Then, palladium-catalyzed
silylation of 2 with triethoxysilane provided ZnPSi2 in moderate yield (39%). Meanwhile, we attempted reactions of YD2-o-C8 with 4-triethoxysilylaniline
in the presence of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,
but the condensation reaction did not proceed and the starting materials
were recovered. After screening a number of condensation reagents,
we found that 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide (Mukaiyama’s
reagent)56 is effective to afford ZnPSi3 in 83% yield. These porphyrins with the triethoxysilyl
anchoring groups could not be purified by conventional silica-gel
column chromatography due to their severe adsorption on the gel. Instead,
we successfully obtained the sufficiently purified porphyrins by gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) and reprecipitation from dichloromethane/acetonitrile.
The characterizations of the porphyrins are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S5).

Optical and Electrochemical Properties
The UV/vis absorption
spectra of the porphyrins in a 4/1 mixture of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran
(THF) (denoted as ethanol/THF (v/v = 4/1)) are depicted in Figure 2 (see also in Table 1). Because ZnPSi2 and YD2-o-C8 exhibit almost the same absorption spectra, the difference in the
triethoxysilyl and carboxylic acid groups has little impact on the
optical properties. A slight increase and red-shift in the absorption
of ZnPSi3 in comparison to those of ZnPSi2 and YD2-o-C8 can be rationalized by an increase in the conjugation by the additional
4-triethoxysilylphenylamido group. In addition, the electron-accepting
character of the amide group can stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO), which also contributes to a slight red-shift (vide
infra). It is noteworthy that ZnPSi1 reveals a decrease
and blue-shift in the absorption compared to those of ZnPSi2 and YD2-o-C8 because of the direct introduction of the triethoxysilyl group into
the meso-ethynyl one. These optical properties are consistent with
theoretical calculations (vide infra). The steady-state fluorescence
spectra were also measured in ethanol/THF (v/v = 4/1) (Figure S6). The trend in the fluorescence maxima
(i.e., ZnPSi1 < ZnPSi2 < YD2-o-C8 < ZnPSi3) matches with that in the absorption maxima in the Q bands (Table 1). From the intersection
of the normalized absorption and emission spectra, zero–zero
excitation energies (E0–0) are
determined (ZnPSi3 (1.88 eV) < YD2-o-C8 (1.89 eV) < ZnPSi2 (1.90 eV) < ZnPSi1 (1.92 eV)), as shown in Table 1.

f Driving forces for the regeneration
of oxidized porphyrin dyes (ZnP•+) by I–/I3– redox couple (+0.4 V vs NHE).

The first oxidation and reduction
potentials (Eox and Ered) of the porphyrins
were determined by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in THF
containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (nBu4PF6) as a supporting electrolyte (Table 1 and Figure S7). The Eox values of
the porphyrins are shifted in the positive direction in the following
order: ZnPSi3 (0.83 V) < YD2-o-C8 (0.84 V) < ZnPSi2 (0.85 V) < ZnPSi1 (0.87 V). In addition, the Ered values are shifted in the negative direction
in the same order. Consequently, the trend of the electrochemical
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–LUMO gaps of the
porphyrin dyes (ZnPSi3 (1.99 eV) < YD2-o-C8 (2.03 eV) < ZnPSi2 (2.05 eV) < ZnPSi1 (2.20 eV)) is consistent
with that of the optical HOMO–LUMO gaps. From the spectroscopic
and electrochemical measurements, we can determine driving forces
for electron injection (ΔGinj) from
the porphyrin singlet excited state (1ZnP*) to a conduction
band (CB) of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs NHE)47 and for regeneration (ΔGreg) of the porphyrin radical cation (ZnP•+) by the I–/I3– redox
couple (+0.4 V vs NHE)47 (Table 1). All of the electron transfer
(ET) processes are expected to occur efficiently because these driving
forces are more negative than −0.4 eV.

To obtain insight
into the ground-state geometry and electronic
structures of the porphyrins, we performed density functional theory
(DFT) calculations on the model porphyrins with the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level (Figure 3). For
all of the porphyrins, the diarylamino and 2,6-bis(alkoxy)phenyl moieties
at the meso-positions are almost perpendicular to the porphyrin plane
because of the steric hindrance. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the
porphyrins are calculated to be 2.47 eV for ZnPSi1, 2.39
eV for ZnPSi2, 2.32 eV for ZnPSi3, and 2.33
eV for YD2-o-C8. The tendency on the calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps agrees with
that on the optical and electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps. The
orbital distributions of HOMO for all of the porphyrins are significantly
localized on the diarylamino moiety. In contrast, the orbital distribution
of LUMO for ZnPSi1 is localized on the porphyrin core
with the ethynyl group, whereas those for ZnPSi2, ZnPSi3, and YD2-o-C8 are further extended into the phenylethynyl moiety.
Because the additional 4-triethoxysilylphenylamido group in ZnPSi3 contributes to an increase in the π-conjugation
and the lower LUMO energy level, the calculated HOMO–LUMO gap
of ZnPSi3 is smaller than that of ZnPSi2 and YD2-o-C8, which is consistent with their optical and electrochemical HOMO–LUMO
gaps. Note that the triethoxysilyl moieties of ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 have no orbital distributions
of LUMO, although the carboxylic acid moiety of YD2-o-C8 has significant orbital distribution
of LUMO. First, the low orbital distributions of LUMO in the anchoring
group may slow down the adsorption of ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 on TiO2. Second, the orbital
distributions of LUMO around an anchoring group are known to affect
the electronic coupling between 1ZnP* and the 3d orbital
of TiO2.57,58 Thus, electron injection from ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 to TiO2 would occur via through-space with their plausible tilted
binding geometry on TiO2, as has been demonstrated by us
before (vide infra).59

with the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. To simplify the calculations, hexyl
groups on the diarylamino groups, octyloxy groups on the meso-aryl
groups, and triethoxysilyl groups were replaced with methyl, methoxy,
and trimethoxysilyl groups, respectively.

Adsorption Behavior
We examined the adsorption properties
of the porphyrins with the triethoxysilyl anchoring group on a TiO2 electrode. When the TiO2 electrode was sensitized
into an ethanol solution of the porphyrins, no adsorption was observed
even in 72 h. Although the reason is unclear at this stage, the triethoxysilyl
group may be overstabilized in ethanol.1 Consequently, the reactivity of the triethoxysilyl group could be
insufficient to adsorb it onto the TiO2 surface in ethanol.
On the other hand, toluene is known as one of the suitable solvents
for sensitization with silicon-based anchoring groups.1,51−55 Actually, after screening the sensitization solvents, we found that
toluene/acetonitrile (v/v = 9/1) is the best condition. The porphyrin
surface coverage (Γ) on the TiO2 electrode was estimated
by measuring the porphyrin absorbance at 639 nm on the TiO2 electrode relative to that of YD2-o-C8 (Figure 4). These adsorption profiles reveal slower adsorption
of the triethoxysilyl anchoring group than that of the carboxylic
acid anchoring group, as predicted. While ZnPSi1 reached
the constant surface coverage on the TiO2 electrode in
3 h, ZnPSi2 and ZnPSi3 adsorbed on TiO2 more slowly, reaching the constant values in 20 h. Overall,
the constant Γ values of the porphyrins with the triethoxysilyl
anchoring group (6.2 × 10–11 mol cm–2 for ZnPSi1, 5.3 × 10–11 mol
cm–2 for ZnPSi2, and 5.8 × 10–11 mol cm–2 for ZnPSi3) are comparable but remarkably smaller than that of YD2-o-C8 (11 × 10–11 mol cm–2). Although the molecular
structures of all the porphyrins are almost identical, their anchoring
groups affect the Γ values considerably. The low Γ values
of the porphyrins with the triethoxysilyl anchoring group are consistent
with the previously reported porphyrin dyes with a silatrane anchoring
group.55 In general, a reaction of trialkoxysilanes
with metal oxides yields bidentate bonding and Si–O–Si
intermolecular cross-linking, which increases the stability.60−62 While disordered multilayer structures are often formed under a
high concentration of the silane solution (>10 mM) due to the Si–O–Si
cross-linking,63 the concentration of the
porphyrins under our condition (0.3 mM) is sufficiently low to form
a monolayer on the TiO2 surface. Judging from the fact
that the Γ values of ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 are a half of YD2-o-C8, which forms densely packed monolayers
on TiO2, ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 are likely to be grafted sparsely on TiO2, leading to their more tilted geometry on TiO2 than that
of YD2-o-C8.64

Photovoltaic Properties
The photovoltaic properties
of the DSSCs based on the porphyrin dyes were measured under the standard
AM 1.5 condition using an electrolyte solution containing the I–/I3– redox couple. To
optimize the cell performances, we first examined the effect of immersion
time on the photovoltaic properties without chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA) (Figure 5).
The η-value is calculated by the following equation: η
= JSC × VOC × ff, where JSC is the short-circuit
current density, VOC is the open-circuit
voltage, and ff is the fill factor. The DSSCs reach the highest η-values
in an immersion time of 1 h (η = 2.0% for ZnPSi1, η = 3.5% for ZnPSi2, and η = 1.0% for ZnPSi3) and then show a decreasing trend in the η-values,
leading to a plateau. The decreasing trend suggests the weak aggregation
behavior of the porphyrin dyes on TiO2. In the next step,
we sensitized each porphyrin with CDCA as a coadsorbent for the suppression
of the dye aggregation on TiO2. After examining the coadsorption
conditions, we found that two-step immersion of the TiO2 electrode into (i) the porphyrin solution first and (ii) then the
CDCA solution improves the η-values of the DSSCs effectively
(Figure 6). The highest
η-values were obtained under different CDCA concentrations (ZnPSi1: η = 2.3% with 0.3 mM CDCA; ZnPSi2: η = 4.7% with 0.3 mM CDCA; ZnPSi3: η =
2.2% with 6.0 mM CDCA). It is noteworthy that the η-value of
the DSSC based on ZnPSi3 reaches the maximum under a
high concentration of CDCA, whereas ZnPSi1 and ZnPSi2 show the maxima under a low concentration of CDCA.
The large dependence of the η-value for ZnPSi3 on
the amount of CDCA suggests a strong aggregation tendency caused by
intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the amide group. Finally, the
DSSCs were stored in the dark to see whether the photovoltaic performances
are further improved by the aging effect,27,65 but it was unsuccessful. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics
of the finally optimized DSSCs are illustrated in Figure 7, and the detailed photovoltaic
parameters are summarized in Table 2.

(v/v = 9/1) solution of the porphyrins (0.3 mM) at 25 °C without
the CDCA adsorbent.

b The TiO2 electrode was
immersed into an ethanol solution of the porphyrin (0.30 mM) without
the CDCA coadsorbent for 3 h. The maximal η-value was obtained
after aging for 4 days.27,66

The optimized average η-value
of the DSSC with ZnPSi2 (η = 4.6%) is significantly
higher than that with ZnPSi1 (η = 2.2%) and ZnPSi3 (η = 2.2%). Note
that the η-value of the DSSC based on ZnPSi2 is
the highest among the DSSCs based on porphyrins with a silicon-based
anchoring group55 owing to the improved
light-harvesting ability by the push–pull structure. However,
it is still lower than that of the DSSC based on YD2-o-C8 under the optimized
conditions in our laboratory (η = 7.7%), in which no CDCA was
used because the η-value decreased upon the addition of CDCA
(Figure S8).47 The reason of the low η-values of the DSSCs based on porphyrins
with the triethoxysilyl anchoring group is not clear at this stage,
but the significantly low Γ values on TiO2 and plausibly
more tilted geometry of the porphyrins on TiO2 may lower
the photovoltaic performances. Overall, the difference in the η-values
mainly results from that in the JSC values.

The absorption spectra of the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 electrodes and the photocurrent action spectra of the DSSCs are
shown in Figure 8.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) is expressed by the
following equation: IPCE = LHE × ϕinj ×
ηcol, where light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) is
the number of absorbed photons per incident photons, ϕinj is the efficiency of the electron injection, and ηcol is the efficiency of the charge collection. The LHE value is likely
to be unity at 380–650 nm considering the high absorbance in
the spectra and the effect of light scattering from the light scattering
layer in the real DSSCs (Figure 8a). The dye aggregation on TiO2 often induces
the self-quenching of the excited state, lowering the ϕinj value. However, the addition of CDCA to dilute the porphyrins
on TiO2 mitigates the dye aggregation on TiO2, reducing the self-quenching. Because the electron injection from 1ZnP* to the CB of TiO2 occurs at the time scale
of 0.1–10 ps, which is much faster than the lifetime (∼2
ns) of 1ZnP*,59 the ϕinj value would be high. Thus, the low ηcol values may be responsible for the low IPCE, JSC, and η values of the DSSC based on the porphyrins
with the triethoxysilyl anchoring group (Figure 8b and Table 2). If incident photons are absorbed by porphyrins far
away from the bottom of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode
due to the low Γ value, the injected electron in the CB of TiO2 should travel a long distance to reach the FTO electrode.
Therefore, the long journey of electrons results in an increase in
undesirable charge recombination (CR) and a resultant decrease in
the ηcol value. Consequently, the low Γ values
of the DSSCs with ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 may be responsible for the low IPCE, JSC, and η values of the DSSCs. Conversely, the larger
η value for ZnPSi2 than ZnPSi1 and ZnPSi3 cannot be explained by the comparable Γ values
in Figure 4 and the
order of the absorption intensity in Figure 8. Our previous studies demonstrated that
the porphyrin tilted geometry on two-dimensional surfaces affects
the ET kinetics between the porphyrin and TiO259,66 or graphene.67 For instance, more upright
geometry of the porphyrin on TiO2 causes slower CR from
the injected electron in the CB of TiO2 to ZnP•+ through the space between TiO2 and the porphyrin core,
leading to the high IPCE value. Moreover, on increasing the spacer
length between the porphyrin core and the attached TiO2 surface, the tilt angle of the porphyrin along the molecular axis
from the surface normal tends to become large. Thus, considering the
order of the spacer length (ZnPSi1 < ZnPSi2 < ZnPSi3), the tilt angle of the porphyrins on TiO2 would increase in the same order. However, the through-space
distance between the porphyrin core and TiO2 does not always
follow the trend because the simultaneous increase in the spacer length
also increases the through-space distance. This trade-off may happen
in this case (Figure S9). If ZnPSi1 is switched to ZnPSi2, both the tilt angle and through-space
distance would become large because the increase in the through-space
distance by the increase in the spacer length is more predominant
than the decrease derived from the increase in the tilt angle. Therefore,
due to the weakened through-space electronic coupling, the undesirable
CR would be suppressed and thus the IPCE, JSC, and overall η values enhanced. In contrast, if ZnPSi2 is further replaced with ZnPSi3, the decrease in the
through-space distance, which is caused by the increase in the tilt
angle, would be more predominant than the increase in the through-space
distance by the increase in the spacer length. Accordingly, as a result
of the strengthened through-space electronic coupling, the CR is accelerated
and thus the photovoltaic parameters deteriorated.

Long-Term Durability
Finally, we investigated the long-term
durability of the DSSC based on ZnPSi2, which attained
the highest η value. The porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were immersed into THF/H2O (v/v = 1/1) with
acetic acid (28 mM) or NaOH (1.0 mM). The amount of the dye on TiO2 was then determined as a function of immersion time from
the absorbance of the TiO2 electrode (Figure 9a). After 7 h of immersion,
60 and 100% of YD2-o-C8 were dissociated from the TiO2 surface under
acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. In contrast, ZnPSi2 was almost retained on TiO2 under the same conditions.
These results clearly exemplify the higher binding ability of the
triethoxysilyl anchoring group than the carboxylic acid anchoring
group. Finally, the long-term durability of the DSSCs based on ZnPSi2 and YD2-o-C8 was assessed under continuous white light illumination
(100 mW cm–2) at 25 °C (Figure 9b). The DSSCs based on ZnPSi2 and YD2-o-C8 displayed 15 and 35% decrease in the η values in 250 h, respectively,
supporting the advantage of the triethoxysilyl moiety in the long-term
durability of DSSCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
example of quantitative evaluation of long-term durability of the
DSSCs with robust silicon-based anchoring groups.

Figure 9 (a) Plots of the amount
of porphyrin on TiO2 as a function
of immersion time for ZnPSi2 (red) and YD2-o-C8 (black) in the presence
of acetic acid (solid lines) and NaOH (dashed lines). (b) Plots of
the normalized η value (average of two independent experiments)
as a function of illumination time for the DSSCs based on ZnPSi2 (red) and YD2-o-C8 (black).

Conclusions
We designed and synthesized a series of
porphyrin dyes with a triethoxysilyl
anchoring group to evaluate the effects of the silicon-based anchoring
group on the long-term durability as well as photovoltaic properties.
The DSSCs based on ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3 exhibited the highest η values of 2.2, 4.7, and
2.3%, respectively, which are lower than that based on YD2-o-C8 (η = 7.7%).
The moderate η values of the DSSCs based on porphyrins with
the triethoxysilyl anchoring group can be attributed to the low ηcol value originating from the low surface coverage. In addition,
the tilted adsorption geometry and the spacer length also affect the
plausible through-space electronic coupling between the porphyrin
core and TiO2 and the resultant ηcol values. ZnPSi2 may show excellent balance between the tilt angle of
the porphyrin on TiO2 and the spacer length among ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3, retarding
the unfavorable CR process and achieving the best photovoltaic parameters.
It is noteworthy that the η value of the DSSC based on ZnPSi2 (4.7%) is the highest ever reported for DSSCs based
on porphyrin dyes with silicon-based anchoring groups as a result
of the improved light-harvesting ability. In addition, we demonstrated
the higher binding stability of the triethoxysilyl anchoring group
than the conventional carboxylic acid anchoring group under aqueous
acidic and alkaline conditions. More importantly, the DSSC based on ZnPSi2 revealed the higher long-term cell durability under
illumination than that based on YD2-o-C8. Therefore, we believe that well-elaborated
dyes with robust triethoxysilyl anchoring groups could be useful for
achieving high photovoltaic performances as well as long-term durability.

Experimental
Section
Instrumentation and Materials
Commercially available
solvents and reagents were used without further purification unless
otherwise mentioned. Silica-gel column chromatography, thin-layer
chromatography, and size exclusion gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
were performed following our previous report.471H and 13C NMR spectra, high-resolution mass
spectra, and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared
spectra were obtained following our previous report.47 UV/vis/NIR absorption spectra of solutions and electrodes
were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer.
Steady-state fluorescence spectra were obtained by a HORIBA Nanolog
spectrometer.

Preparation of Dye-Sensitized TiO2 Cells
The preparation of TiO2 electrodes and
the fabrication
of the sealed cells for photovoltaic measurements were conducted according
to the literatures.47,68 A nanocrystalline TiO2 layer of 12 μm (d = 30 nm, PST30NR-D, Dyesol)
was coated on an FTO glass plate by screen printing. Then, a sub-microcrystalline
TiO2 layer of 4 μm (d = 400 nm,
CCIC, PST400C; JGC-C&C) was further formed on top of the FTO.
For ZnPSi1, ZnPSi2, and ZnPSi3, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into a toluene/acetonitrile
solution (v/v = 9/1) of 0.30 mM porphyrin at 25 °C. Then, the
porphyrin-adsorbed TiO2 electrode was further immersed
into an ethanol solution of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) for 2 h.
For YD2-o-C8, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into an ethanol solution
of the porphyrin (0.30 mM) at 25 °C without CDCA. The porphyrin
surface coverage on the TiO2 electrode (Γ mol cm–2) was estimated by measuring the porphyrin absorbance
at 639 nm on the TiO2 electrode relative to that of YD2-o-C8. The surface
coverage of YD2-o-C8 on TiO2 was determined by measuring the absorbance
of the porphyrin that was detached from TiO2 into the THF/water
(v/v = 1/1) solution containing 0.1 M NaOH.

A sandwich cell
was prepared by using the dye-anchored TiO2 electrode as
a working electrode and a counter Pt electrode, which were assembled
with a hotmelt-ionomer electrode Surlyn polymer gasket (50 μm;
DuPont). The electrolyte solution was composed of 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium
iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.01 M guanidinium thiocyanate,
and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in an acetonitrile/valeronitrile
mixture.
