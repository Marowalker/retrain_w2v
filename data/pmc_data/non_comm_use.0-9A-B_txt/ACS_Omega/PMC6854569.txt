Surfactant-enhanced soil washing
is an effective remediation method
for petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil. The residual petroleum
hydrocarbons in the washing effluents reduce the elution ability of
the washing effluents and cause secondary pollution to the environment.
In this work, modified corncobs were prepared and used as selective
adsorbents to remove the residual petroleum hydrocarbons in washing
effluents. The structure of adsorbent was characterized and the adsorption
conditions were optimized. With the adsorption by corncob-based adsorbents,
washing effluents can be regenerated and recycled. After five cycles,
the recovery efficiency of the washing effluents is still as high
as 75.4%. The optimal adsorbent linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS-Cb)
also exhibited excellent recyclability, which can be recycled five
times. The selective adsorption mechanism of the LAS-Cb for petroleum
hydrocarbons in washing effluents, related to its huge hydrophobic
core and surface electronegativity, is proposed.

1 Introduction
Petroleum hydrocarbons
in soils result in long-term contamination
that poses potential hazard to human health and harm the ecosystem
function.1 To remediate the petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated
soil, more attention has been paid on surfactant-enhanced soil washing,
owing to its relatively high washing efficiency (WE).2 In the engineering practice of remediation of petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated
soil, washing soil with an aqueous solution of anionic–nonionic
mixed surfactants has been considered to be the most promising method,3 owing to its better solubilization capacity for
hydrophobic organic contaminants.3,4 Although surfactant-enhanced
soil washing has been widely practiced as a preferred treatment option,
in previous studies, little attention has been paid to the regeneration
and reuse of washing effluents for remediation of petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated
soil. Washing effluents that elute soil petroleum hydrocarbon, on
the one hand, containing residual petroleum hydrocarbon, if not treated,
are bound to cause secondary pollution to the environment. On the
other hand, if the washing effluents are not recycled, the surfactant
in the washing effluents will be wasted, resulting in a significant
increase in remediation costs.5 Therefore,
the regeneration of washing effluents, both for protecting the environment
and for reducing the cost of washing, has important practical significance.

The key to the recycling of washing solution is to remove the residual
petroleum hydrocarbons. Recently, some technologies6−9 have been developed to remove
organic pollutants from aqueous solutions, so as to realize the regeneration
of washing effluents. Among these techniques of washing solution recovery,
adsorption is an important alternative for its high efficiency, lower
cost, and easy operation.6,8

Previous studies
have demonstrated that activated carbon, as an
excellent adsorption material, has been widely used to remove organic
pollutants in water.10 However, there are
two obvious disadvantages11 for the activated
carbon, for washing effluents regeneration may confine its application
to a great extent: (i) the high cost for the preparation and regeneration11 and (ii) lack of selective adsorption ability,
which is easy to cause the co-sorption of hydrophobic petroleum hydrocarbon
and surfactant molecules
on the surface of the activated carbon. Consequently, the purpose
of this study is to develop a low-cost adsorption material which can
be applied for the selective adsorption of petroleum hydrocarbons
from the washing effluents for the remediation of petroleum-contaminated
soil, thus leading to the regeneration and recycling of washing effluents.

Recently, the removal of pollutants from wastewaters by biosorption
with agricultural wastes has attracted more attention because of their
abundance and economic viability.12,13 Some studies
showed that corncob, mainly composed of lignin, the polysaccharides
cellulose and hemicellulose, exhibited excellent adsorption performance.14 Further researches revealed that the adsorption
capacity of cellulosic waste materials can be greatly improved by
proper chemical modification.15 At present,
corncob-based adsorbent materials have been widely used for the removal
of heavy metal ions,16,17 organic dyes,18,19 and nitrate.20 There are few researches
on corncob-based adsorbents removing petroleum hydrocarbons from washing
effluents for petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil.

In this
work, a novel corncob-based adsorption material was prepared
and used to remove the petroleum hydrocarbons from the soil-washing
effluents, thus it provides a recyclable washing effluent to wash
the petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil. When the corncob-based
adsorbent is added into the soil-washing effluents, the petroleum
hydrocarbons are selectively adsorbed on the surface of the corncob-based
adsorbent. By centrifugation, the petroleum-loaded adsorbent is removed,
resulting in the formation of regenerated washing effluents. As a
result, the regenerated washing effluents can be further used to wash
the petroleum-contaminated soil. With the help of the corncob-based
adsorbent, we can recycle the washing effluent at least five times.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that recycling
of washing effluents for petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil
is achieved by corncob-based adsorbents.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Prepared Adsorbents
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
micrographs of the prepared
adsorbents (C, Cb, and LAS-Cb) are shown in Figure 1. Compared with C, Cb and LAS-Cb exhibit
flourishing pore structures. Previous research has reported that alkaline
hydrolysis can cause the disruption of the lignin structure.21 Therefore, these generated pores can be attributed
to the chemical reaction during pretreatment processes.

Figure 1 SEM images
for C (a), Cb (b), and LAS-Cb (c).

The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of C, Cb, and LAS-Cb
are shown in Figure 2. The adsorption isotherms of C and Cb are very similar and display
a type IV with hysteresis loops corresponding to type H4 from nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms, indicating slit-shaped mesoporous
characteristics. It is noteworthy that the adsorption isotherm of
LAS-Cb exhibits a type IV isotherm with an H3 hysteresis loop,22 which is obviously different from those of C
and Cb. The results of specific surface area and volumetric adsorption
measurements of the adsorbent are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that textural properties
of corncob have been greatly changed after modification with LAS.
Specific surface areas, total pore volumes, and average pore diameter
increase by about 3.4, 5, and 1.4 times compared to C. The fact that
the increase of pore volumes matches up with the observations in Figure 1.

The
surface roughness of the three corncob-based adsorbents was
characterized by an atomic force microscope (AFM). As shown in Figure 3a, C and Cb show
a relatively smoother surface compared with LAS-Cb. Some granule-like
microstructures were observed on the surface of LAS-Cb. Based on the
analysis of the synthesis process of LAS-Cb, these granule-like microstructures
can be attributed to the surfactant layer grafted on the corncob surface.
The measured surface roughness (Ra) of the three adsorbents increases
in the following order: C (1.10 nm) < Cb (2.21 nm) < LAS-Cb
(3.76 nm), suggesting that alkali treatment and surfactant grafting
modification increase the surface roughness, among which, surfactant
grafting causes the most significant changes in the surface roughness.

Figure 3 Three-dimensional
AFM images (a) and the contact angles (b) of
C, Cb, and LAS-Cb, respectively.

The surface wettability of the three corncob-based adsorbents was
investigated by contact angle measurement. As can be seen in Figure 3b, the contact angle
of C, Cb, and LAS-Cb was 44.9, 63.2, and 82.2°, respectively.
The changes of contact angle can be attributed to the change of the
surface structure of the adsorbents. The highest contact angle was
observed on the surface of LAS-Cb, suggesting that hydrophobicity
of the LAS-Cb was significantly enhanced after grafting anionic LAS
surfactant on the surface of the corncob. Previous studies have shown
that the adsorbent with a hydrophobic surface was more conducive to
the adsorption of hydrophobic organic contaminants.23

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of
C, Cb, and LAS-Cb
are shown in Figure 4. It is noted that the absorption band characteristic of the glucosidic
ring at 897 cm–1 can be observed in all adsorbent
spectra, suggesting that the structure of the glucosidic ring remains
intact after the chemical modification of natural corncob.24 The peak at 1404 cm–1 is ascribed
to O–H deformation vibration in the phenolic hydroxyl group
of lignin.25 It can be seen that, after
the alkali pretreatment, the peak intensity corresponding to phenolic
hydroxy for Cb and LAS-Cb becomes weak, which can be attributed to
the consumption of phenolic hydroxy due to the reaction with alkali.
After LAS grafting treatment, a new peak appears at 1107 cm–1 on the surface of LAS-Cb, which corresponds to the C–S stretching
vibration of LAS.26 This result indicates
that LAS has been successfully grafted onto the surface of the corncob.

spectra for C, Cb, and LAS-Cb.

2.2 Optimization of Adsorption Conditions
The
LAS-Cb was used to optimize the adsorption conditions, including
surfactant (LAS) dosage on the corncob, adsorbent dosage, adsorption
time, and temperature. As can be seen in Figure 5a, the washing efficiency (WE) of regenerated
effluents increases gradually with increasing the surfactant dosage
on the corncob until it reaches a maximum value with a surfactant
dosage of 5%. Further improving surfactant dosage (>5%) may lead
to
the blockage of mesopores on the corncob, reducing the number of active
sites on the surface27 and finally causing
the decline of washing efficiency of regenerated effluents. In Figure 5b, a similar variation
tendency was also observed for the effect of adsorbent dosage on the
washing efficiency (WE) of regenerated effluents. WE values were 60.5,
62.1, 71.9, 67.6, and 64.4% for the dosage of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
and 1.0 g/100 mL, respectively. In the initial stage, the increasing
dosage of adsorbents had a dramatic positive impact on WE, while a
further increase of the adsorbent dosage (>0.5 g/100 mL) led to
the
decline of WE. It could be attributed to the coagulation and precipitation
of LAS-Cb at higher concentrations. Adsorption time is another important
variable affecting adsorption efficiency. Figure 5c exhibits the WE of regenerated effluents
at different adsorption times. WE first increased with the increase
of adsorption time. At 30 min, WE reached its maximum at 71.9% and
then decreased slightly. Therefore, the optimum adsorption time was
selected as 30 min. The effect of temperature on the adsorption of
petroleum hydrocarbons by LAS-Cb was also investigated. The results
are illustrated in Figure 5d. It was observed that the WE decreased from 71.9 to 64.3%
as the adsorption temperature increased from 25 to 75 °C. This
result exhibited that the adsorption of petroleum hydrocarbons from
washing effluents is an exothermic process.28

(LAS) dosage on the corncob, (b) adsorbent dosage, (c) adsorption
time, and (d) adsorption temperature.

2.3 Recyclability Performance
The regeneration
capacity of the washing effluents was investigated, and the results
are shown in Figure 6. The recovery efficiency (RE) of the washing effluent was used to
evaluate its regeneration capacity. The RE of the fresh washing solution
is defined as 100%. It can be seen that the RE value for adsorbent
C is up to 80.7%. This indicates that the corncob itself has a regeneration
capacity for the washing effluents. The regeneration capacity of washing
effluents can be further improved when the corncob is treated with
alkali or modified with a surfactant. The RE value for Cb and LAS-Cb
is 83.8 and 96.9%, respectively. The regenerative washing ability
of washing effluents results from the adsorption removal of petroleum
hydrocarbons by adsorbents. The excellent regeneration capacity of
LAS-Cb for washing effluents may be related to its high hydrophobicity
and negative surface charge. The former is beneficial to the adsorption
of petroleum hydrocarbons in washing effluents, whereas the latter
is beneficial to keep negatively charged anionic–nonionic mixed
micelles in washing effluents through electrostatic repulsion.

Figure 6 Regeneration
capacity of washing effluents in the presence of C,
Cb, and LAS-Cb, respectively.

The washing performances of regenerated effluents treated with
and without an adsorbent are compared, as shown in Figure 7. It can be seen that the RE
value of washing effluents that are recycled directly without treatment
is 61.5, 33.7, 8.4, 0, and 0%, respectively. By contrast, the corresponding
values of washing effluents that are treated with the adsorbent (LAS-Cb)
are 97.5, 94.8, 88.7, 80.9, and 75.4%, respectively. The results show
that adsorbent LAS-Cb plays a significant role in restoring the washing
efficiency of regenerated effluents. With the help of the adsorption
of LAS-Cb, the recycling of washing effluents is realized. After five
cycles, the RE value of the washing effluents is still as high as
75.4%. The excellent recyclability of the washing effluent treated
with adsorbent could be explained by the following reason that the
petroleum hydrocarbons in micelles could be removed by the corncob-based
adsorbent (i.e., LAS-Cb), providing the regenerated adsorption capacity
of the anionic–nonionic mixed micelles. Therefore, washing
effluents could be recycled. In addition, multiple uses of washing
effluents will greatly reduce the cost of remediation of petroleum-contaminated
soil by the commonly used surfactant-enhanced washing method.

of the recyclability of washing effluents treated with
and without adsorbent.

The recyclability of
adsorbent (LAS-Cb) was also evaluated (see Figure 8). The recovery efficiency
(RE) of the washing effluent regenerated by LAS-Cb was used to reflect
the recyclability of LAS-Cb. It can be seen that the RE value in five
cycles is 94.9, 86.7, 82.1, 80.1, and 74.9%, respectively. After LAS-Cb
was reused five times, its RE value was still up to 74.9%, suggesting
that the prepared LAS-Cb has excellent recyclability.

LAS-Cb.

2.4 Selective
Adsorption Mechanism
To
better understand the excellent selective adsorption capacity of LAS-Cb
for petroleum hydrocarbons in washing effluents, a selective adsorption
mechanism is proposed, as shown in Figure 9. The reason why washing effluents lost their
ability to wash the petroleum-contaminated soil was that anionic–nonionic
mixed micelles have absorbed petroleum hydrocarbons and reached saturation.
The mechanism of selective adsorption of petroleum hydrocarbon in
washing effluents by adsorbent LAS-Cb lies in its unique structure:
a huge hydrophobic core and negative charges on the surface.

Figure 9 Schematic illustration
of selective adsorption of petroleum hydrocarbons
from soil-washing effluents with the synthesized adsorbent.

When the adsorbent LAS-Cb is added into the washing
effluent, LAS-Cb
adsorbent and the petroleum-loaded micelle attract each other, and
then the petroleum hydrocarbon molecules migrate to the hydrophobic
surface of LAS-Cb driven by hydrophobic–hydrophobic interactions.29 Afterward, the negative nonionic mixed micelles
and negatively charged petroleum-loaded LAS-Cb were separated by electrostatic
repulsion. Finally, the regenerated micelle diffused into the bulk
solution, becoming an active component of the washing solution again,
and the petroleum-loaded LAS-Cb was removed by centrifugation.

Thus, by virtue of the selective adsorption role of LAS-Cb, the
petroleum hydrocarbons are selectively separated from washing effluents
and enriched on LAS-Cb surface. After subsequent centrifugation, LAS-Cb
adsorbed with petroleum hydrocarbons can be separated from the washing
effluents. The regenerated washing effluent still contains a large
number of effective anionic–nonionic mixed micelles, which
can be used again to remediate petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated
soil with high washing efficiency.

3 Conclusions
Corncob-based adsorbents were prepared to adsorb residual petroleum
hydrocarbons from washing effluents. The optimal adsorbent LAS-Cb
exhibited excellent selective adsorption performance for petroleum
hydrocarbons. The selective adsorption capacity of LAS-Cb can be attributed
to its unique structure: hydrophobic core and surface electronegativity.
By virtue of the selective adsorption role of LAS-Cb, washing effluents
can be recycled and reused five times. This result has important significance
in the remediation of petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil: the
cost for remediation will be greatly reduced; secondary contamination
caused by washing effluents can be successfully avoided.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Natural
corncob was collected
from Tianjin (China). Anionic surfactant (linear alkylbenzene sulfonates,
LAS), sodium hydroxide, and Triton X-100 (TX-100) were purchased from
Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China).
Other chemicals such as concentrated sulfuric acid, deionized water,
and distilled water were obtained from Tianjin Huadong Reagent Factory
(Tianjin, China).

4.2 Preparation of the Corncob-Based
Adsorbent
Corncob powder (C) was sieved to 180 μm and
dried at 100
°C before use. The preparation of LAS-modified corncob (LAS-Cb)
was carried out by the following procedures: 20.0 g of C was slowly
added into 200.0 mL of sodium hydroxide aqueous (0.6 M) with mechanical
stirring at room temperature for an hour. After that, the solid phase
in this solution was obtained and then dried at 50 °C to obtain
alkali-treated corncob (Cb). The obtained Cb was then added into 80.0
mL of LAS aqueous solution with suitable ration under stirring, treated
by ultrasonic for 10 min, and then washed with distilled water and
dried at 100 °C to generate LAS-Cb. All of the adsorbents were
stored at room temperature in air.

4.3 Characterization
of the Adsorbent
The morphological characterization of the
prepared adsorbent was
studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) taken on Shimadzu SS-550
at 15 kV. The surface roughness of the adsorbent was observed by an
atomic force microscope (AFM) taken on Agilent Technologies AFM-5500.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the adsorbent were recorded
on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
isotherms were measured on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer
at 77 K. The surface areas of the adsorbent were calculated by the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the pore size
was calculated by the Barett–Joyner–Halenda method.

In addition, the contact angle experiment was also carried out by
a contact angle meter (KRUSS DAS30) to evaluate the surface wettability
of the prepared adsorbent. Briefly, 0.5 g of the adsorbent was tableted
with a tablet press under a pressure of 20 MPa. The adsorbent was
placed into the contact angle meter and then 2 μL of deionized
water was dripped onto the surface of the adsorbent. Finally, the
contact angle between the deionized water and the surface of the adsorbent
was measured.

4.4 Preparation of Soil-Washing
Effluents
Petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil with 22
wt % content of
hydrocarbons was obtained from the suburb of Dongying city (China),
which has been dried in air for a few years. The collected petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated
soil was first screened through a 0.1 mm sieve and the concentration
of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil was determined by gravimetric
method.30 The fresh washing solution containing
LAS, TX-100, and sodium silicate was prepared according to the reported
studies.31 Briefly, the mixed surfactant
solution was first prepared by using a mass ratio of LAS to TX-100
of 8:2. And then, 5.0 g/L sodium silicate was added into the 3.0 g/L
mixed surfactant solution to obtain the fresh washing solution.

The preparation of the soil-washing effluents was performed as follows:
3.0 g of petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil was added into 100.0
mL of the fresh washing solutions (with 0.3 g of surfactant) under
continued stirring for about 20 min. After that, this solution was
heated at 75 °C for an hour under magnetic stirring in a water
bath. This solution was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min and
the supernatant was used as the soil-washing solution to perform the
adsorption experiment again.

4.5 Adsorption Experiment
In the adsorption
experiment, 0.5 g of the adsorbent was added into 100.0 mL of the
soil-washing solution. The solution was stirred for 30 min at room
temperature (25 °C) and then it was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
8 min. The supernatant was collected and used as the regenerated washing
effluent in our work. And then, the regenerated washing effluent was
further used to wash the petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil.
The washing efficiency (WE) was given by 1  where c1 is the
concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons in the unwashed petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated
soil and c2 is the concentration of petroleum
hydrocarbons in the washed petroleum-hydrocarbons-contaminated soil.
In addition, recovery efficiency (RE) was used to reflect the washing
capacity of regenerated washing effluents and it can be calculated
by using the following equation 2  where WE1 is the WE of the fresh
washing solution and WE2 is the WE of the regenerated washing
effluent.

To investigate the recyclability of the washing effluent,
the reuse experiment of the washing effluent was performed for five
cycles. During these five cycles, 100.0 mL of the washing effluent
was reused continuously five times, and the adsorbent was removed
from the washing effluent after each cycle by centrifugation, prior
to re-adding the unused adsorbent (0.5 g) into the washing effluent
in the next cycle. All other experimental conditions and procedures
were the same as those of the adsorption experiment. Similarly, the
reuse experiment of the adsorbent was also carried out for five cycles
to investigate the recyclability of the adsorbent. During these five
cycles, 0.5 g of the adsorbent was reused continuously five times
and 100.0 mL of the new soil-washing effluent was used in each cycle.
All other experimental conditions and procedures were the same as
those of the adsorption experiment. It should be noted that all of
the recycle experiments were studied in triplicate.
