Styrene-butadiene
rubber (SBR) is widely used in the tire, footwear,
and belt industries. SBR products contain a high content of carbon
black, which is hazardous to human health and the environment. The
goal of this study is to investigate the potential of using bio-based
cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) as a replacement for carbon black under
simulated industrial formula/processing conditions. CNFs were surface-modified
using five different reagents to have either −SH or −C=C
functional groups grafted onto their surfaces. Vulcanized SBR sheets
reinforced with pristine CNFs, and the five functionalized CNFs were
prepared and their properties were tested and compared with those
of industrial SBR containing carbon black. All the CNFs, pristine
or modified, demonstrated higher reinforcing efficiencies (property
increase/amount of reinforcement) than carbon black. The modified
CNFs showed even higher reinforcing efficiencies than the pristine
ones because of the former’s better dispersion and stronger
interfacial bonding. The −SH and −C=C functional
groups reduced the hydrophilicity of CNFs and allowed chemical linkages
between CNFs and SBR to be established during vulcanization. Solvent
(toluene) resistance of the rubber was also improved after the incorporation
of CNFs because of the barrier effect of the nanofibers and the restrained
SBR chain mobility. The latter also led to reduced rubber damping.
Although CNFs provide much stronger reinforcement than carbon black,
going forward, SBR/CNFs/carbon black hybrid nanocomposites can also
be developed to offer tailorable property combinations that meet different
application requirements.

Introduction
Nanosized reinforcing fillers are commonly
incorporated in rubber
to increase its strength, abrasion resistance, UV stability, and other
performances. The fillers also play a significant role in many aspects
of rubber processing, impacting the vulcanization process, curing
kinetics, and cross-linking density of the resultant rubber products.
The fillers affect the mechanical and viscoelastic properties of rubber
through filler–polymer and filler–filler interactions.1−3 The dominant filler used in the rubber industry is carbon black.
Carbon black provides vulcanized rubbers significant improvement in
strength as well as resistance to abrasion and UV degradation.4,5 The weight percentage of carbon black in rubber can be as high as
50%.

There are however many drawbacks involved in both the production
of carbon black and its use in rubber. Carbon black is produced through
thermal processes using heavy oil or natural gas as the feedstock.
In the processes, greenhouse gases and other pollutants are emitted.
Carbon black in discarded rubber products such as tires may is potentially
harmful if leached into the environment. Carbon black is also a significant
workplace safety concern as it is carcinogenic and hazardous. For
these reasons, both industry and academia have dedicated resources
to develop suitable replacements for carbon black.

In recent
years, many nanomaterials have been proposed as potential
candidates for rubber reinforcement including: nanoclay, carbon nanotubes,
graphene, and cellulose nanofibrils/nanocrystals (CNFs/CNCs).6−13 CNFs/CNCs represent a unique opportunity as reinforcing fillers
for rubbers as these materials are bio-based and their supply is virtually
inexhaustible.14 CNFs/CNCs have a large
surface area and a high aspect ratio, which, based on composite mechanics,
are ideal for stress transfer and therefore reinforcement. They also
feature high strength and modulus and a surface chemical structure
which can be tailored to promote strong interfacial bonding to different
matrix polymers. The native surfaces of CNFs/CNCs consist of many
hydroxyl groups, which are responsible for their strong hydrophilic
nature. This poses a challenge in incorporating them into hydrophobic
polymers and achieving strong fiber–polymer bonding.14,15 Surface functionalization of CNFs/CNCs is required in such situations
to attach functional groups that can interact with the polymers to
the cellulose nanomaterials.

Trovatti et al. compounded bacterial
cellulose (BC) nanofibers
and BC decorated with polystyrene (BCPS) into natural rubber (NR)
latex for reinforcement.9 PS was utilized
to compatibilize the BC with the hydrophobic NR to improve interfacial
adhesion and BC dispersion. The system was vulcanized using sulfur
vulcanizing agents. Both BC and BCPS were shown to increase the tensile
modulus and strength of the rubber nanocomposites. The storage modulus
of the composites mentioned above Tg was
significantly increased after incorporating BC or BCPS. Visakh et
al. reinforced NR latex with bamboo pulp-derived cellulose nanowhiskers
(CNW).16 A two-step masterbatch technique
was used in rubber composite preparation and the rubber was vulcanized
using sulfur. The tensile strength was increased from approximately
9 MPa for the neat NR to 14 MPa at 10% CNW. The CNW-reinforced NR
also showed higher solvent resistance and higher storage modulus than
the neat NR. Yin et al. used BC to reinforce styrene-butadiene rubber
(SBR).17 Tensile strength of the nanocomposites
was increased significantly (from 2.4 to 9.9 Mpa) when using up
to 2.5 parts per hundred rubber (phr) BC. CNCs were also incorporated
into NR, epoxydized NR, and SBR to produce water-responsive nanocomposites.
The water-induced, adaptive mechanical behavior was attributed to
the establishment/destruction of strong hydrogen bonding between CNCs
or between CNCs and rubber chains.18,19 In all these
studies, the rubber latexes were not vulcanized and hence their mechanical
properties were relatively low.

Surface functionalization of
cellulose nanomaterials has been extensively
studied and many important methods have been discussed and summarized
in review articles and books.14,20,21 Parambath Kanoth et al. utilized Fischer esterification to incorporate
mercapto functional groups (−SH) onto CNC (m-CNC) and used
the material as reinforcement and a cross-linking agent in NR.22 The free radical thiol–ene cross-linking
reactions between m-CNC and NR were initiated by UV irradiation. The
nanocomposites containing m-CNC had a higher cross-link density than
pristine CNC, indicating the formation of covalent bonds between CNC
and the NR matrix. m-CNC-reinforced samples performed significantly
better in terms of both tensile strength and strain compared with
pristine CNC-reinforced samples. Kato et al. functionalized CNFs by
attaching saturated and unsaturated fatty acid chains to the nanofibers
via esterification.23 Both modified CNFs
were found to improve the degree of cross-linking of NR and significantly
increase its tensile strength and Young’s modulus. The CNFs
modified with unsaturated fatty acid provided a larger increase in
tensile strength because of the additional cross-linking reaction
via the C=C of the unsaturated acid.

Rosilo et al. functionalized
CNCs via esterification with long-chain
unsaturated fatty acids.24 The functionalized
CNCs were incorporated in poly(butadiene) rubber and the composite
was cross-linked by UV radiation. TEM results revealed that the CNCs
were well dispersed to form intercalated domains of self-aligned CNCs.
Tensile strength of the nanocomposites increased with increasing CNC
content up to 80%. Chen et al. functionalized cellulose by grafting l-cysteine onto the surface of cellulose fiber.25 The authors found that this functionalization significantly
improved sorption capacity of the fibers toward mercury because of
strong affinity between mercury and the thio groups on l-cysteine. l-Cysteine consists of multiple functional groups including
amine, thio, and carboxylic acid, which make it potentially versatile
for use as a cross-linking agent in many thermosetting polymers.

SBR is the most widely used synthetic rubber in the tire industry.26 Our literature review has shown that reinforcing
SBR via incorporating cellulose nanofibers is still rare. This is
especially the case when the vulcanized SBR is intended for tire
use (instead of SBR latex for coating and bonding) and functionalized
cellulose nanofibers are involved. Therefore, the goal of this research
is to systematically study the reinforcement of a series of pristine
and functionalized CNFs to SBR products fabricated by the standard
rubber production method. The properties of the SBR/CNF nanocomposites
will be compared with those of industrial standard SBR that contains
50 phr carbon black. This study showed that CNFs even in their pristine
form were much more effective in reinforcing SBR than carbon black.
Functionalization of CNFs further increased the level of reinforcement
because of their improved dispersion and enhanced interfacial bonding
to SBR. Considering other rubber properties offered by carbon black
including UV resistance, electrical/thermal conductivities, and so
forth, a CNFs/carbon black/SBR hybrid nanocomposite should also be
considered to achieve a property set that is comparable to or better
than that of carbon black-filled traditional SBR products.

SBR/CNFs nanocomposites were studied via tensile testing. Representative
stress–strain curves of the samples are shown in Figure 1 and the average properties
and their standard deviations are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1a compares the tensile curves of SBR reinforced with
three different concentrations (i.e., 3, 7, and 9%) of pristine CNFs.
The curves for industrial SBR and neat SBR are also shown as the baselines

Pristine CNFs provide significant reinforcement to SBR as shown
in Figure 1a. Failure
strength and elastic modulus of the samples increase with the increasing
CNF content up to 7%. The 7% sample shows the best overall results:
a modulus increase from 1.64 to 10.33 MPa, a failure strength increase
from 3.20 to 8.06 MPa, and a failure strain increase from 714 and
786%. The 9% sample exhibits a further increase in modulus (12.29
MPa) compared with the 7% sample, however, both failure strength (6.16
MPa) and failure strain (239%) of the sample decrease. A decrease
in failure strain is typical at high levels of reinforcement loading
in polymer composites, which normally suggests significant aggregation
of the reinforcement, resulting in formation of defect sites inside
the nanocomposites.9,24 The overall increases in mechanical
properties by the CNF reinforcement is attributed to the load sharing
of the CNFs from the SBR matrix. The formation of a percolating CNF
network is also likely and contributes to the property increases.
The increases also suggest that the solution blending process is relatively
effective in dispersing hydrophilic pristine CNFs in the hydrophobic
SBR matrix.

It is interesting to note the difference in stress–strain
behaviors between the industrial SBR (or neat SBR) and the SBR/CNFs
nanocomposites: a nearly linear stress–strain relationship
at large strains for the former and an extensive yielding and cold
drawing process similar to the behavior of thermoplastics for the
latter (especially the samples containing 7 and 9% CNFs). Rubber elasticity
is entropy driven and rubber deformation does not normally show yielding
and cold drawing, which are typical signs of irreversible plastic
deformation of materials. Being a covalently linked polymer network,
rubber has the ability to undergo large reversible deformation at
relatively low stresses. The yielding and cold drawing that occurred
on the CNF-reinforced SBR may be partially attributed to interfacial
debonding and interfacial slip between CNFs and SBR, which leads to
large-scale irreversible deformation. Additionally, the CNFs in SBR
during sulfur vulcanization could serve as physical barriers that
hindered the reaction and therefore reduced the number of cross-links
between rubber chains. If the CNFs can also form covalent links with
the rubber chains, it should be expected that the yielding and cold
drawing behaviors will be largely mitigated, as will be discussed
later.

While pristine CNFs do show a significant reinforcement
effect,
the material pales in comparison with 50 phr carbon black that is
used in industrial SBR, which displays a modulus of 7.35 MPa, a failure
strength of 16.10 MPa, and a failure strain of 408%. Carbon black’s
large influence on the mechanical properties of the rubber stems from
both filler–rubber and filler–filler interactions. The
filler–rubber interaction can be described as a complex physical–chemical
interaction in which carbon black is entangled within a web of rubber
chains. Carbon black can then interact with rubber chains via both
van der Waals’ and covalent interactions depending on the surface
reactivity of both rubber chains and carbon black. The number of covalently
attached rubber chains to the surface of carbon black increases with
decreasing carbon black particle size and increasing particle surface
activity.3,5,27 Above a threshold
concentration, homogenously dispersed carbon black nanoparticles tend
to form a percolated 3-dimensional network through filler–filler
interactions within the matrix elastomer, which also contributes to
the reinforcement.

When comparing the reinforcement effect of
pristine CNFs and carbon
black, it is important to note that CNF loading levels are significantly
lower than that of carbon black. The reinforcement potential of CNFs
is therefore much higher than that of carbon black as they provide
a greater increase per percent of the reinforcing material. For instance,
each percent of carbon black and CNFs leads to an 8 and 22% average
increase to the failure strength of the rubber (calculated by the
percentage strength increase divided by the corresponding filler content),
respectively. The higher reinforcing efficiency of CNFs is primarily
because of the material’s fibrillar shape (i.e., high aspect
ratio) and high strength and modulus. Based on composite mechanics
theory, other conditions being equal, the reinforcing material with
a higher aspect ratio and higher strength and modulus leads to stronger
reinforcement to the matrix. CNFs, being nanofibers with exceptional
strength and modulus, is therefore much more effective at reinforcing
SBR than spherical carbon black particles.

Figure 1b shows
the stress–strain curves of the SBR samples reinforced with
surface-functionalized CNFs. Five varieties of functionalized CNFs
were tested at a loading level of 7% to determine which functionalization
method had the greatest effect on the resulting nanocomposite properties.
The five functionalization methods introduced either −SH or
−C=C functional groups to the surface of the CNFs, as
listed in Table 3.
Each variant of the functionalized CNFs is shown to provide improvement
on the mechanical properties of the resulting SBR nanocomposites over
the pristine CNFs. Modulus and failure strength of the nanocomposites
increased across the board when the pristine CNFs were replaced with
the functionalized CNFs, whereas the fracture strain decreased. These
changes can be attributed to the grafted −SH or −C=C
groups, through which the functionalized CNFs are covalently linked
to the SBR chains during the sulfur vulcanization process. The covalent
bonding between SBR and the functionalized CNFs increases stress transfer
between the two phases when the composites are under load and restricts
the mobility of the SBR chains, thus leading to improved reinforcement
compared with the pristine CNFs. Also, because of the improved interfacial
bonding, the extensive cold drawing process demonstrated by the pristine
CNF-reinforced SBR can be seen largely depressed in the SBR samples
reinforced by functionalized CNFs (see Figure 1b).

Figure 1b demonstrates
that SBR reinforced with functionalized CNFs is one step closer in
terms of mechanical properties to the industrial SBR. Among the functionalized
CNFs, TC-CNF, T3-CNF, and T11-CNF have the same functional −SH
groups on their surfaces. Their effects on the mechanical properties
of SBR can be compared using the data (i.e., 7% TC-CNF, 7% T3-CNF,
and 7% T11-CNF) given in Table 1. 7% TC-CNF shows the highest modulus but the lowest strength
among the three samples; 7% T11-CNF shows a lower modulus and a higher
strength compared with 7% TC-CNF; 7% T3-CNF has the lowest modulus
but the highest strength among the samples. The different reinforcement
results rendered by the three functionalization agents can be related
to their different chain lengths (e.g., 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid
vs 3-mercaptopropionic acid) and molecular structures (e.g., the additional
−NH2 group on cysteine), which can affect the interactions
between SBR and the functionalized CNFs and the dispersion of the
nanofibers. A similar phenomenon can also be observed from the nanocomposites
reinforced by the CNFs functionalized with −C=C groups,
that is, 7% A4-CNF and 7% A10-CNF in Table 1. A4-CNF produced a higher composite modulus
and strength than A10-CNF. Further studies are needed to understand
the steric effects of these different agents on the mechanical properties
of the nanocomposites. Below A4-CNF and TC-CNF will be chosen as respective
representative for −SH- and −C=C-functionalized
CNFs to study their impacts on other properties of SBR at different
nanofiber concentrations.

Figure 2 details
stress–strain results for the A4-CNF- and TC-CNF-reinforced
SBR at 3, 7, and 9% nanofiber concentrations. Both types of nanocomposites
show increases in strength and modulus and decreases in failure strain
with the increasing nanofiber concentration. For all three concentrations,
the functionalized CNFs produce higher modulus and strength than the
pristine ones, again due to the increased interfacial bonding between
the functionalized CNFs and SBR. The decrease in failure strain can
be attributed to increasingly restrained mobility of SBR chains at
higher nanofiber concentrations. Comparing Figure 2a,b, A4-CNF is shown to give higher strength
and modulus than TC-CNF at the same nanofiber concentrations. These
results suggest that the interfacial bonding between A4-CNF and SBR
is stronger than that between TC-CNF and SBR, which may be ascribed
to a lower density of grafted −SH on the CNF surface, as indicated
by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results presented in the
next section.

Figure 2 Representative tensile stress–strain curves of
SBR reinforced
by functionalized CNFs. (a) 4-pentenoic acid-functionalized CNFs and
(b) cysteine-functionalized CNFs.

The A4-CNF-reinforced SBR nanocomposites were also prepared
using
toluene as the solvent. Toluene is less polar than tetrahydrofuran
(THF) while A4-CNF is much less hydrophilic compared with the pristine
CNF because of the grafted hydrocarbon short chains. Therefore, A4-CNF
should have a better dispersion in toluene than in THF, which can
result in better reinforcement to the rubber. In Table 1, comparing the data for the
SBR/A4-CNF nanocomposites prepared using THF and toluene, respectively
(e.g., 3% A4-CNF vs 3% A4-CNF-Tol), the samples prepared using toluene
generally show comparable or moderately improved mechanical properties,
suggesting the polarity of the solvent does have an impact on the
nanocomposite properties. However, because the impact is not significant,
toluene is not further tested on other nanocomposites.

Cellulose Surface
Chemical Analysis
FT-IR spectra of
TC-CNF, A4-CNF, and the pristine CNFs are compared in Figure 3. The peak at approximately
1640 cm–1 in Figure 3a is associated with the N–H bend of the primary
amine present in the cysteine molecules. The presence of this peak
indicates the presence of covalently attached cysteine molecules on
the surface of TC-CNF. The peak at approximately 1750 cm–1 in Figure 3b is associated
with the carbonyl group (C=O) present on the ester linkages.
The peak at approximately 1650 cm–1 is associated
with the −C=C groups on the 4-pentenoic acid. The presence
of these peaks indicates that the esterification procedures to graft
cysteine and 4-pentenoic acid onto CNF surface were successful.

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra
of (a) TC-CNF and (b) A4-CNF. The spectrum of the
pristine CNFs is shown at the bottom of each figure for comparison.

Elemental analysis was performed
to further support the FT-IR results. Table 2 details the elemental
percentages of C, N, H, S, and O of the pristine and functionalized
CNFs. The theoretical composition of the pristine cellulose is also
provided for comparison. It is important to note that elemental analysis
performed did not yield oxygen percentages. Percent oxygen values
listed in Table 2 were
calculated assuming that oxygen makes up the remaining mass of each
cellulose material.

Table 2 Elemental Analysis
Results for the
Pristine and Functionalized CNFs

TC-CNF	41.68	6.09	1.16	2.38	48.69	
A4-CNF	46.64	6.57	 	 	46.79	
The theoretical and experimental
compositions of the pristine CNFs
are similar, demonstrating the accuracy of this analysis method. For
A4-CNF, the degree of substitution (DS) can be estimated according
to a previously published method to be approximately 0.15.28 The formulation for the calculation of DS however
does not work in the case where the substitute molecules contain nitrogen
and sulfur elements. However, the elemental data can still be used
to prove the successful grafting of cysteine onto CNFs. The elements
N and S (one of each) of the cysteine molecule should be present in
the final TC-CNF in a fashion consistent with the individual molecular
weights of N and S present on the cysteine molecule. The molecular
weight of N and S is 14.007 and 32.06, respectively. The theoretical
mass ratio of N to S of a single cysteine molecule is 0.4369. Elemental
analysis found that TC-CNF contained a ratio of N to S of 0.4874.
These similar results indicate that the cysteine molecule has been
successfully attached to the CNF surface.

Nanocomposite Morphology
Nanocomposite morphologies
were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging of cryo-fractured
and tensile fractured sample surfaces. Figure 4 shows images of cryo-fractured neat SBR
as well as the SBR/pristine CNFs nanocomposites. The surface of the
neat SBR is largely smooth and flat, dotted with particles measuring
less than 1 μm (Figure 4a,b). The exact identity of these particles is unknown but
could be aggregated vulcanization agents or simply impurities. The
addition of the pristine CNFs significantly increases the number of
the particles present on the sample surfaces, as shown in Figure 4c,e,f. CNFs and their
bundles can be clearly seen on the high magnification images on the
right. Some relatively large CNF agglomerates are also present, especially
in the composites with high CNF contents. In general, the number of
the large irregular agglomerates increases with the increasing CNF
content. Aggregation of the pristine CNFs at high concentrations is
somewhat expected because of the incompatibility between hydrophilic
nanofibers and the hydrophobic SBR matrix. However, they still show
significant positive effects on SBR mechanical properties, as shown
earlier. Specifically, at 7% CNF concentration, strength, modulus,
and strain of the nanocomposite are all higher than those of the neat
SBR (see Table 1).

Figure 4 SEM images
of cryo-fractured surfaces of neat SBR and SBR/CNFs
nanocomposites. (a,b) Neat SBR, (c,d) 3% CNFs, (e,f) 7% CNFs, and
(g,h) 9% CNFs. All CNFs are pristine ones.

Tensile fracture surfaces of neat SBR and pristine CNF-reinforced
SBR samples are compared in Figure 5. The neat SBR shows a relatively clean and flat surface
decorated by scattered particles (see Figure 5a,b). Some of the particles are embedded
on the surface, resembling the structure of the cryo-fractured surface
of the neat SBR (Figure 4a,b). Other particles appear to be loosely deposited on the surface.
These particles may originate from other regions of the fracture surface;
they broke away from the surface and landed at their current locations
during the fracture process. The incorporation of various concentrations
of the pristine CNFs drastically changed the features of the fracture
surfaces (Figure 5c–h).
The sample with 3% CNFs clearly shows a much rougher surface compared
with the neat SBR. The high roughness can be ascribed to the many
voids on the surface that are formed when the particles are pulled
out during the tensile test (Figure 5c,d). Further increases in the CNF content result in
even rougher surfaces, showing fibers with various sizes being pulled
out from the matrix. The fiber pull out indicates that the fiber-matrix
interfacial bonding is relatively weak for the pristine CNFs. The
presence of large fiber bundles on the surfaces suggests poor compatibility
between the pristine CNFs and SBR. Although many large size particles
can be seen on these surfaces, high magnification images (insets in Figure 5) clearly show that
there are also numerous nanosized cellulose fibers present on the
facture surfaces.

(g,h) 9% CNFs. All CNFs are pristine ones. Insets are high magnification
images.

The morphology of SBR/A4T-CNF-Tol
nanocomposites prepared using
toluene is shown in Figure 6. As the content of A4T-CNF increases, the number of fibers
and fiber aggregates on the surfaces also increases, a trend also
recognized for the pristine CNFs. However, for A4T-CNF-Tol, the size
of the fibers/aggregates is more uniform and is much smaller than
that of the pristine CNFs. The smaller and more densely populated
fibers/aggregates indicate that the surface-modified A4T-CNF is more
uniformly dispersed in the SBR matrix than its pristine counterpart
because of its increased compatibility with the rubber matrix. This
better dispersion, together with the chemical linkage established
between the fiber and the rubber during vulcanization, led to the
improved mechanical properties of the A4-CNF-reinforced SBR nanocomposites.

(a,b) 3, (c,d) 7, and (e,f) 9%.

SEM images of the tensile-fractured SBR/A4T-CNF-Tol nanocomposites
are shown in Figure 7. The surfaces appear to be similar to those of the SBR/pristine
CNFs nanocomposites (Figure 5): high roughness, voids, and pulled-out fibers. However,
a close comparison between the two materials indicates that the composites
containing the pristine CNFs do show more severe fiber pull-out and
more signs of matrix deformation than those containing the functionalized
CNFs, in agreement with the tensile results that the former exhibits
lower failure strength but higher failure strain than the latter (see Table 1). For comparison,
the tensile fracture surfaces of SBR/TC-CNF nanocomposites are also
shown in Figure 8.
The surfaces appear similar to those of SBR/A4T-CNF-Tol. A subtle
difference is that SBR/TC-CNF does show more material deformation
and fiber pull-out. This behavior is typically associated with more
ductile nanocomposite behavior and agrees well with the tensile results
as the SBR/TC-CNF nanocomposites have a higher fracture strain compared
to the SBR/A4T-CNF samples. This result combined with the fact that
the TC-CNF nanocomposites displayed a lower failure strength than
the A4T-CNF ones suggests that the fiber-matrix interactions in SBR/TC-CNF
is weaker than that in SBR/A4T-CNF.

Viscoelastic Properties
Tan δ is an important
parameter to characterize damping of rubber products. A lower tan
δ indicates an increase in rigidity of a material and its lower
capability to dissipate energy. The tan δ curves for the neat
rubber and its various nanocomposites are compared in Figure 9. The pristine CNFs reduced
tan δ of SBR, with a higher nanofiber concentration leading
to a larger decrease (see Figure 9a). The functionalized CNFs, shown in both Figure 9b,c, appear to cause
even larger decreases in tan δ (especially in the case of A4T-CNF),
indicating their stronger restraints to SBR chain mobility than the
pristine CNFs. It is interesting to note that the tan δ peak
temperature for SBR/A4T-CNF-Tol nanocomposites decreases with increasing
nanofiber content (Figure 9b). The peak is associated with the glass transition of SBR.
The decrease in the peak temperature for these samples may be attributed
to the toluene solvent used in preparing the nanocomposites. Toluene
has a much higher boiling point than THF (110 vs 66 °C) and it
is possible that some toluene remained in the composites after the
sample preparation process. The residual toluene in the SBR/A4T-CNF-Tol
nanocomposites functioned as a plasticizer to lower the glass transition
temperature of SBR. By contrast, THF used for preparing the other
two nanocomposites was mostly removed during the preparation process
because of its low boiling point. Therefore, TC-CNF slightly increased
the glass transition temperature of SBR because of its strong restraint
on chain mobility (Figure 9c), whereas the pristine CNFs showed a negligible effect on
the glass transition (Figure 9a).

Solvent Resistance
SBR dissolves in toluene if not
vulcanized. Vulcanization covalently links SBR chains together to
form a network and therefore the vulcanized SBR only swells, rather
than dissolve, in toluene. Other conditions being equal, solvent absorbancy
of the rubber is inversely proportional to the degree of cross-linking.
Additionally, CNFs (pristine and functionalized alike) also affect
solvent absorbency because it can slow down solvent diffusion in the
rubber and restrain chain movement to reduce swelling. Studying the
solvent intake of the SBR/CNFs nanocomposites can produce information
regarding their cross-linking status and morphology. Figure 10 shows toluene absorbency
as a function of time for the neat SBR and its nanocomposites. In
general, all the samples exhibit a similar absorption pattern in which
the rate of absorption (slope of the curve) is high initially but
decreases gradually over the 80 min soaking time. The incorporation
of both pristine and functionalized CNFs decreased the absorbency
and the rate of absorption of the samples, with a higher CNF content
leading to a larger decrease in both properties. This result confirms
the nanofibers’ hindrance to solvent diffusion and rubber chain
movement, especially at high nanofiber concentrations when a nanofiber
network may form inside the rubber. The barrier effect of the CNFs
can be particularly strong in the CNF-rich regions of the nanocomposites,
where SBR chains can be trapped by the nanofibers and hence have no
access to the solvent.

Figure 10 Toluene uptake of (a) SBR/pristine CNFs, (b)
SBR/A4T-CNF-Tol, and
(c) SBR/TC-CNF nanocomposites.

There is a notable difference in toluene uptake between the
pristine
CNFs and the functionalized CNF-reinforced SBR. As shown in the SEM
results earlier, the functionalized CNFs exhibit more uniform dispersion
in SBR and show a smaller average particle size than the pristine
CNFs. This leads to a larger volume of interphase regions in the nanocomposites
where the movement of SBR chains is restrained by the nanofibers.
The functionalized CNFs also exert a higher level of restraints on
the surrounding SBR chains than the pristine CNFs because of the former’s
covalent bonds to the chains. These two factors together contribute
to the lower toluene uptake of the SBR reinforced with functionalized
CNFs. Comparing the uptakes between the SBR/A4-CNF-Tol and the SBR/TC-CNF
nanocomposites (Figure 10b,c), the former shows a lower uptake after the same period
of immersion time, with the difference being particularly large for
the two nanocomposites containing 3% nanofibers. This can be attributed
to A4-CNT’s better dispersion in SBR because of the use of
toluene as the solvent. The improved dispersion also contributes to
the higher mechanical properties of the SBR/A4-CNF-Tol nanocomposites,
as discussed earlier in the mechanical properties section.

Conclusions
In this study, industrially important SBR was reinforced with pristine
and functionalized CNFs. The functionalization of CNFs was performed
through the esterification reaction using five different reagents
and as a result, −SH or −C=C functional groups
were successfully attached to the nanofiber surface. Mechanical testing
showed that CNFs (pristine or functionalized alike) showed much higher
reinforcement efficiency than carbon black, an industrial standard
filler material. All the functionalized CNFs demonstrated stronger
reinforcement than the pristine CNFs because of the former’s
better dispersion in the SBR matrix and covalent bonding with the
rubber chains. Damping of all the rubber nanocomposites was reduced,
with the functionalized CNFs causing larger decreases because of their
larger surface areas (better dispersion) and stronger restraints on
chain mobility than the pristine CNFs. Solvent resistance of the rubber
was also improved after incorporating CNFs because of the barrier
effect of the nanofibers and the restrained chain movement.

Although CNFs, especially functionalized CNFs, can lead to higher
SBR strength and modulus than carbon black at the same filler concentration,
the decrease in damping may not be desired for some applications.
Additionally, properties such as UV resistance and conductivity that
are rendered by carbon black are also lost in the carbon black-free
SBR. A logical next step is to develop CNFs/carbon black/SBR hybrid
nanocomposites, in which performance synergy may originate from the
two reinforcements. This new development will be reported in our forthcoming
publication.

Experimental Section
Materials
CNFs
were purchased from the Process Development
Center of University of Maine. SBR (KER 1502 SBR) was supplied by
Synthos S.A. N330 grade carbon black was acquired from Sid Richardson
Carbon & Energy Co. Sulfur, N-tert-butyl-2-benzothiazyl sulfonamide (TBBS), stearic acid, zinc oxide,
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), 4-dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP), 4-pentenoic acid, 10-undecenoic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic
acid, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, cysteine, THF, anhydrous dimethylformamide
(DMF), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were of reagent grade and purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation of Surface-Functionalized CNFs
CNFs were
esterified using a one-step Steglich esterification technique typically
utilized for protein and peptide modification. CNFs were first solvent
exchanged via centrifugation into anhydrous DMF. The resulting suspension
was then added to a round-bottomed flask. Additional anhydrous DMF
was added at a CNFs/DMF ratio of 1:100 (g/mL). EDC and DMAP were then
added in excess to the suspension at the same CNFs/reagent ratio of
1.25:1 (g/g). 0.45 mM of various functional reagents specified in Table 3 were then added to the suspension. The round-bottomed flask
was then stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The resulting esterified
CNFs were then washed to remove residual chemicals in THF, deionized
(DI) water and/or toluene via centrifugation.

Steglich esterification
is a mild reaction in which dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) is typically used as a coupling reagent and DMAP as a catalyst
to allow ester formation from alcohols and carboxylic acids.29 In this work, EDC is substituted for DCC to
avoid the formation of dycyclohexylurea, which is poorly soluble in
water.30 EDC and DCC share the same coupling
mechanism. However, the byproduct from EDC coupling is isourea, which
is soluble in water. Water solubility of the byproduct allows for
easy extraction via centrifugation.

Preparation of Vulcanized
SBR Nanocomposites
An industrial
SBR formulation used by Nocil Limited was chosen as the base formulation.
The base formulation (industrial SBR) and the formulations for SBR/CNFs
nanocomposites are given in Table 4. The industrial SBR was incorporated with 50 phr carbon
black. The SBR/CNFs nanocomposites contained at 3, 7, or 9 wt % CNFs
based on the SBR weight. Neat SBR containing no carbon black was also
prepared for property comparison.

The industrial SBR samples
were prepared using a standard rubber
compounding procedure. The ingredients listed in Table 4 were loaded into a HAAKE RHEOMIX
OS lab mixer, equipped with Banbury-type mixing blades and a chamber
volume of 60 ccm. Samples were kneaded at 20 rpm until the torque
output from the lab mixer stabilized. This usually took approximately
7–9 min. The temperature of the mixing chamber was set to 60
°C and allowed to increase to approximately 70 °C during
operation. Samples were then shaped into disks using a Brabender Prep-Mill
laboratory two-roll mill with a roller temperature of 60 °C.
Shaped rubber disks were then vulcanized via pressing in an Elcometer
heated press at 2400 N and 145 °C for 36 min. The neat SBR samples
were prepared following the same procedure except without incorporating
any carbon black.

SBR/CNFs nanocomposites were prepared by first
using a solution
casting technique to incorporate pristine CNFs or the functionalized
CNFs into SBR. SBR gum rubber was dissolved in THF at room temperature.
Vulcanization reagents and CNFs were then added to the solution and
the suspension was homogenized using an ULTRA-TURRAX homogenizer (IKA,
Wilmington, NC, USA) equipped with IKA 25N 25F dispersing elements
(6000 rpm) for 15 min. The homogenized suspension was then dried by
natural evaporation at room temperature followed by drying in a vacuum
oven for 12 h. The dried samples were further blended and shaped into
disks using a Brabender Prep-Mill laboratory two-roll mill with a
roller temperature of 60 °C. The shaped rubber disks were then
vulcanized via pressing in an Elcometer hot press under 2400 N and
145 °C for 36 min.

To examine the effect of the solvent
on the mechanical properties
of the nanocomposites, toluene was also tested as the solvent in the
solution casting process for one nanocomposite (SBR/A4-CNF). Toluene
was chosen for this test because of its lower polarity than THF, which
may lead to better dispersion of A4-CNF in the SBR matrix.

Tensile
Testing
Tensile properties were examined in
accordance with ASTM D412-15a. Vulcanized rubber disks were cut into
dumbbell shapes using an ASTM D412 certified cutter. A minimum of
three samples for each formulation were tested using an MTS Insight
electromechanical tester (Eden Prairie, MN, USA) equipped with a 5
kN load cell and Advantage pneumatic grips with rubber-coated surfaces.
All tests were conducted under 50% relative humidity and 22 °C
temperature with a crosshead speed of 500 mm/min. The test results
for each formulation were averaged and a standard deviation was calculated.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
FT-IR was utilized
to study and confirm chemical structure changes imparted to the cellulose
via surface esterification. A Nicolet 8700 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) FT-IR equipped with a smart iTR attenuated total reflection
module was used to obtain each spectrum. FT-IR spectra were obtained
in the range of 4000–650 cm–1.

Elemental Analysis
Elemental analysis was performed
by Atlantic Microlab, Inc. (Norcross, GA). Functionalized and pristine
CNFs were washed and dried at 60 °C for 8 h in a vacuum oven.
CHNS analysis was then performed and the resulting mass percentages
of elements C, H, N, and S were obtained.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Morphology of tensile
fracture surfaces were studied using a JEOL JSM-6490LV SEM (JEOL USA,
Peabody MA, USA) operating at a 15 kV accelerating voltage. The samples
were mounted on the sample stage using colloidal silver paste (Structure
Probe Inc., West Chester PA, USA) and coated with gold using a Cressington
108 auto sputter coater (Ted Pella Inc., Redding CA, USA). Samples
were also fractured in liquid nitrogen to avoid sample deformation
so that the original phase morphology of the samples was retained.
The cryo-fractured surfaces were similarly studied using the SEM.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
Dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) experiments were performed using a TA Instruments (New Castle,
DE, USA) Q800 DMA operating in the tension mode. A frequency of 1
Hz and a temperature sweep from −80 to 60 °C at 3 °C/min
were utilized to study the viscoelastic behavior of the samples as
a function of temperature.

Toluene Uptake
Samples were cut
into 1 cm × 0.5
cm × 1.4 cm pieces and immersed in toluene at room temperature
to study their solvent resistance. Weight increases were recorded
every 10 min up to 80 min of total soaking time. Samples were removed
from the toluene and lightly dabbed to remove excess solvent. Sample
weight was measured using an analytical balance, followed by reimmersion.
Toluene uptake at each respective time was calculated as  where W0 is the
sample initial mass and Wt is the sample mass at immersion time t.
