Highly luminescent ternary Zn–Ga–S
quantum dots (QDs)
were synthesized via a noninjection method by varying Zn/Ga ratios.
X-ray diffraction and Raman investigations demonstrate composition-dependent
changes with multiple phases including ZnGa2S4, ZnS, and Ga2S3 in all samples. Two distinct
excitation pathways were identified from absorption and photoluminescence
excitation spectra; among them, one is due to the band-gap transition
appearing at around 375 and 395 nm, whereas another one observed nearby
505 nm originates from sub-band-gap defect states. Photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of these QDs depict multiple emission noticeable at around
410, 435, 461, and 477 nm arising from crystallographic point defects
formed within the band gap. The origin of these defects including
zinc interstitials (IZn), zinc vacancies (VZn), sulfur interstitials (IS), sulfur vacancies (VS), and gallium vacancies (VGa) has been discussed
in detail by proposing an energy-level diagram. Further, the time-dependent
PL decay curve strongly suggests that the tail emission (appear around
477 nm) in these ternary QDs arises due to donor–acceptor pair
recombination. This study enables us to understand the PL mechanism
in new series of Zn–Ga–S ternary QDs and can be useful
for the future utilization of these QDs in photovoltaic and display
devices.

1 Introduction
Unique
optical and electronic properties of semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) make them a potential material for solar cells,1,2 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),3,4 spintronics,5,6 and bioimaging7,8 applications. Semiconductor QDs
with emission over the entire visible range and high quantum yields
(QYs) are suitable for display devices.9 Cadmium (Cd)-containing semiconductor QDs such as CdSe, CdS, CdTe,
etc. have excellent optical properties with emission over the entire
visible range.10−12 Further, these QDs have been proved as a potential
material for photovoltaic devices in recent decades.13,14 Meanwhile, the toxicity and environmental aspects of these semiconductor
QDs rendered their practical applications difficult, since they contain
heavy metal Cd.15,16

Recently, Cd-free ternary
I–III–VI chalcogenide QDs
such as CuInS2, CuInSe, AgInS2, ZnInS, etc.
were explored as an emerging material for applications in solar cells
and LEDs.17,18 These ternary semiconductor QDs have composition-
and size-dependent optical properties.19 Further, they have large absorption cross section, favorable charge-transport
characteristics, and long exciton lifetimes.20,21 Besides, they also have high power conversion efficiency (PCE) similar
to Cd-containing II–VI QDs. In the materials using ternary
nanocrystals as a solar cell, up to 3.5, 6.6, and 11.6% PCE was achieved
for AgInSe2, CuInS2, and CuInSe–ZnSe,
respectively.22−24 Moreover, among Cd-free QDs, carbon-based QDs are
a new class of materials with excellent optical and biological properties.
They are different from ternary QDs in terms of composition and crystal
structure.25

Meanwhile, the photophysical
properties of these ternary QDs are
very challenging and complex from II–VI semiconductor QDs.
Photoluminescence (PL) emission in II–VI QDs mainly originated
from radiative recombination of electrons and holes from band edge.12,26,27 On the other hand, recent studies
revealed that PL emission occurring in ternary QDs is from radiative
donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombination, which originates from
intrinsic defects.20,21,28,29 The uncertainties related to these internal
defect states result in the complication of proposing a general model.
Another aspect is the broad absorption and emission feature with no
apparent excitonic properties. These characteristic features are still
debatable and ascribed to be due to their unique electronic properties,
such as size and shape inhomogeneity, irregular distribution of elements
and composition, and sub-band-gap states. The Kamat group has reported
a study on the photodynamics of Cu-In-S2 QDs by varying
the Cu/In ratio.21 It has observed broad
emission with two distinct absorptions. In UV–vis absorption
spectra, one peak appears from the band edge with excitonic character
and other broad tail absorption originates from the Cu-related state
lying just within the band gap. Besides, the broad emission is attributed
to the transitions involving the band gap (excitonic), sub-band-gap
(DAP), and surface states. Another study was carried out by the same
group on AgInS2–ZnS quaternary QDs.20 In this study, the origin of significant Stokes shift and
long PL lifetimes has been explained by the DAP mechanism as a dominating
radiative process arising from antisite defects within the band gap
of the QDs.

Recently, Zhang et al.30 have reported
a new series on ternary Zn–Ga–S QDs with Ag-doping.
These ternary QDs have luminescence properties with emission spanning
over violet to aqua, via variation of Zn/Ga ratios. Motivated by these
results, here, we have synthesized Zn–Ga–S ternary QDs
by varying Zn/Ga ratios and first time explored their photophysical
properties. PL spectra of as-synthesized QDs show multiple emission
arising from multiple defect states lying within the band gap. Using
UV–vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL), photoluminescence
excitation (PLE), and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)
techniques, the complex recombination processes have been further
resolved by proposing an energy-level diagram. The PL quantum yield
(QY) of these QDs was found to be very high, 42%, for the Zn/Ga ratio
of 1.0. Moreover, the phase structure and morphology of as-synthesized
QDs were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and TEM analyses.
XRD and Raman studies demonstrate a stoichiometry-dependent structure
with multiple phases, which is in good agreement with optical characterizations.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images depict the near-spherical
shape of the nanocrystals with average diameters of 5.5, 6.0, and
7.5 nm for 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 Zn/Ga ratios, respectively.

2 Results and Discussion
A one-spot noninjection method
was adopted to prepare 1-dodecanethiol
(DDT)-capped Zn–Ga–S ternary QDs. The schematic diagram
of the synthesis mechanism is shown in Figure 1A. Three compositions of Zn–Ga–S
QDs were synthesized by varying Zn/Ga ratios, that is, 0.25, 0.50,
and 1.0. This method has several features like reproducibility and
scale-up capability of the work.31,32 The phase
composition of as-synthesized Zn–Ga–S ternary QDs was
identified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, which is shown
in Figure 1B with increasing
Zn/Ga ratios. As shown in the figure, the XRD pattern of Zn–Ga–S
QDs well indexed with three mixed phases, namely, tetragonal ZnGa2S4, zinc blende (cubic) ZnS, and hexagonal Ga2S3.33−35 It is very exciting to see that the XRD pattern shows
a composition-dependent mixed phases. For Zn/Ga = 0.25, the planes
(1̅11) and (101) of Ga2S3 become more
prominent, representing that most of the contribution is from the
hexagonal Ga3S3 phase. Moreover, as Zn/Ga ratios
increase, the Ga2S3 phase becomes less noticeable
and zinc blende ZnS phase becomes more prominent, which is validated
by increasing intensities of (111), (220), and (311) planes. Also,
all materials contain a tetragonal ZnGa2S4 crystal
structure as a common phase. A recent study by Dong et al. has elucidated
similar results in their report in the case of Zn-In-Se ternary QDs.29 They have observed multiple phases including
ZnIn2Se4, In2Se4, and
ZnSe. In another work on the In–Zn–Se alloy, Lee and
co-workers have illustrated In+3-dominated multiple phases
such as ZnIn2Se4, ZnSe, and In2Se3.36

(B) XRD patterns of Zn–Ga–S QDs with varying Zn/Ga ratios,
and (C) Raman spectra of Zn–Ga–S QDs with increasing
Zn/Ga ratios (bottom to top).

Figure 1C shows
Raman spectra of Zn–Ga–S QDs with increasing Zn/Ga ratios
(bottom to top). A peak centered at around 263 cm–1 appears in all samples, attributed to transverse optical (TO) mode
of ZnS.37,38 Further, at higher wave number, a broad
hump ranging from 300 to 450 cm–1 is observed. This
broad hump is deconvoluted into two peaks at around 353 and 390 cm–1 using Gaussian function fitting. The peak centered
at around 353 cm–1 appears due to longitudinal optical
(LO) phonon mode of ZnS, whereas the peak at 390 cm–1 is assigned to F2 of Ga2S3.37−39 Moreover, it is also noticed that the intensity of TO and LO peaks
increases with increasing Zn/Ga ratios, confirming that the ZnS phase
is the dominating phase as the Zn/Ga ratio increases. Similarly, the
intensity of the F2 peak also increases with decreasing
Zn/Ga ratio, affirming that the Ga2S3 phase
is more dominating in the sample when the Zn/Ga ratio decreases. Therefore,
similar to the XRD pattern, Raman spectra also demonstrate composition-dependent
changes with multiple phases, including ZnS and Ga2S3.

The shape and size, morphology, of Zn–Ga–S
QDs were
investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2A–C are the TEM images
of Zn–Ga–S QDs with varying Zn/Ga ratios. As shown in
the picture, Zn–Ga–S QDs possess near-spherical shapes
with average diameters 5.5 (±0.9), 6.0 (±0.8), and 7.5 (±0.9)
nm for 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 Zn/Ga ratios, respectively. The particle
size histogram is given in Figure 2D. The inset image of Figure 2B is its high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image
where interplanar spacing is found to be 0.32 nm, which is ascribed
to the (111) plane of zinc blende ZnS. Further, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis was carried out to get information
about elemental contents of as-synthesized ternary QDs. Table 1 illustrates the normal ratio
(as calculated theoretically) and EDX analysis ratio for Zn–Ga–S
QDs. The results obtained from the EDX analysis were quite close to
the expected value. Details of elemental information, including sulfur
contents, are provided in the Supporting Information in Figure S1A–C.

2.1 Optical Properties
The excitonic
feature of multiphase Zn–Ga–S ternary QDs was determined
by steady state absorption spectroscopy, which is shown in Figure 3A. The absorption
spectra of all QDs contain multiple peaks: a band edge transition
observed at around 390–400 nm and another next excited state
transition nearby 375 nm. Moreover, as clearly seen in the absorption
spectra, a tail absorption starting from 550 nm having a maximum at
around 505 nm is present in all samples. The origin of this tail absorption
is possibly a sub-band-gap transition originating from defect states
within the band gap. Further, it was found that the absorption peak
slightly blue-shifted (4–8 nm) with increasing Zn/Ga ratio.
The corresponding optical band gap was calculated by the Tauc relation,
which is shown in Figure 3B. The observed band gap slightly increased with increasing
Zn/Ga ratio and was found to be 3.15, 3.18, and 3.21 eV for 0.25,
0.50, and 1.0 of Zn/Ga ratios, respectively. The reason behind the
increase in the optical band gap of Zn–Ga–S QDs with
an increase in Zn/Ga ratio is due to the higher band gap of ZnS (3.49
eV) in comparison to Ga2S3 (2.5 eV).30

(F) schematic energy-level diagram illustrating optical excitation
pathways.

Figure 3C shows
PL spectra of Zn–Ga–S QDs with variation in the Zn/Ga
ratio, at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. It is clear from the
figure that the PL spectra contain multiple emissions for all compositions
of Zn–Ga–S QDs. A very slight blue shift (1–3
nm) has been observed in emission spectra with increasing Zn/Ga ratios.
The inset images of Figure 3C are photographs of the QDs under a UV lamp, showing bright
violet-to-aqua emission with increasing Zn/Ga ratios.30 Thus, obtained photos under the UV lamp visibly demonstrate
the compositional variation, which was also observed in the XRD pattern.
Moreover, we have calculated QY of these ternary QDs using the standard
organic dye 9,10-diphenylanthrancene and found maximum up to 42% for
a composition with Zn/Ga = 1.0. Details of QY calculations are given
in the Supporting Information, Section S3. Figure 3D is deconvolution
of the emission spectrum of Zn–Ga–S QDs with the Zn/Ga
ratio of 0.5 using Gaussian fit, and the PL spectrum can be deconvoluted
into four peaks.40 The obtained results
from the fitting are summarized in Table 2. A very sharp peak with a full width at
half-maximum (FWHM) of 14 nm is observed at around 410 nm, which is
denoted in Figure 3D by “1”. Further, a high-intensity peak with a FWHM
of 20 nm has been deconvoluted at 435 nm, which is indicated by “2”.
Moreover, peak “3” has been deconvoluted at 461 nm with
a slightly larger FWHM of 25 nm. Finally, at higher wavelength, a
vast peak with FWHM of 68 nm appears at around 477 nm, which is denoted
as “4”. The origin of these peaks will be discussed
in the next section.

The PLE spectra of ternary QDs can provide
insight into the origin
of sub-band-gap and band-gap transitions and mechanism of the radiative
process, as shown earlier by various groups.20,21,29Figure 3E shows PLE spectra of Zn–Ga–S QDs with
varying Zn/Ga ratios at an emission wavelength of 600 nm. PLE spectra
at other wavelengths are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S4A–C. As shown in Figure 3E, three distinct transitions
are observed in the PLE spectra of all samples. A broad transition
at around 505 nm is observed in all samples. The origin of this transition
may be due to the sub-band-gap excitation, including zinc and gallium
defect states since energy gaps from these defect states well-matched
with this transition.34,39 The basis of these sub-band-gap
defects will be discussed in the next section. Moreover, at a lower
wavelength, two more peaks are observed at around 395 and 375 nm and
can be assigned to the band edge and next-level excited state transitions,
respectively. For a clear understanding of theses transitions, an
energy-level diagram is given in Figure 3F. The Kamat group members observed similar
characteristics in their previous studies.20,21 Thus, PLE spectra clarify that sub-band-gap low-energy optical transitions
are responsible for longer-wavelength emission in these ternary QDs.

The time-correlated single-photon measurement was performed to
understand carrier dynamics, carrier lifetime, and origin of various
emissions. For this measurement, each sample was dispersed in toluene
and excited by a pulsed laser with a wavelength of 375 nm. Further,
the decay was monitored between 400 and 600 nm emission wavelength
over a time window of 65 ns. Figure 4A–C show normalized PL decay profiles for Zn–Ga–S
QDs with increasing Zn/Ga ratios. For all samples, PL decay increases
with increasing emission wavelength, which is indicated by an arrow
(a) → (e) in the figure. This behavior suggests that at higher
wavelength, donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombination is the
dominating radiative process in these new series Zn–Ga–S
ternary QDs.20,21,41 The luminescence decay can be well fitted with a biexponential fitting.
Fitting details are given in the Supporting Information, Section S5. When the PL decay curve was monitored
near band edge (450 nm), a shorter lifetime (τave) of 22, 11, and 25 ns was observed for 0.25. 0.50, and 1.0 Zn/Ga
ratios, respectively. When emission decay was monitored at the longer-wavelength
side (600 nm), a longer lifetime of 31, 34, and 64 ns was observed
for 0.25. 0.50, and 1.0 Zn/Ga ratios, respectively.

Figure 4 PL decay curves of Zn–Ga–S
QDs at different emission
wavelengths from 400 to 600 nm: (A) Zn/Ga = 0.25, (B) Zn/Ga = 0.50,
and (C) Zn/Ga = 1.0.

The appearance of a less
energetic photon with a longer lifetime
in the higher-wavelength region indicates DAP recombination. Lower-energy
photons generated from donors are far distant to acceptors, leading
to lower probability to occur because of their smaller wave function
overlap. For higher-energy photon emission, the donor–acceptor
pairs are in close proximity to each other and thus have a higher
probability of recombinations.20,42 Therefore, the PL lifetime
of DAP recombination increases with increasing emission wavelength.

2.2 Origin of Multiple Emission from Zn–Ga–S
QDs
In a crystalline material, electronic bands are formed
due to translational symmetry. If the material has defects and impurities,
then the periodicity of the lattice gets perturbed, leading to the
formation of discrete energy levels within the band gap of the material.
Depending on impurities and defects, these levels behave as donors
or acceptors. Figure 5 is a schematic energy-level diagram for Zn–Ga–S QDs
based on the discussion above on XRD, Raman, UV–vis, PL, PLE,
and TCSPC results. Five types of point defects are presented, including
zinc interstitials (IZn), zinc vacancies (VZn), sulfur interstitials (IS), sulfur vacancies (VS), and gallium vacancies (VGa).35,43−47 Among them, IZn and VS act as localized donor
states, while IS, VZn, and VGa behave
as acceptor states. Interstitial states will be formed when an extra
atom or ion is positioned at a site that is not occupied in the perfect
crystal. As an ion takes such place, the neighboring atoms rearrange
themselves. Thus, the ionic radii of the positioned atom decide the
extent of deformation. Since zinc ions have smaller ionic radii (0.74
Å) than sulfur ions (1.70 Å), the sulfur interstitials have
more lattice strain. This results in the lesser binding energy of
electronic levels associated with site IS, whereas IZn sites have more considerable binding energy. Consequently,
IS states lie just above the valance band edge than IZn states to the conduction band edge.43−47 Therefore, peak 1 at 410 nm originates from radiative
recombination of conduction band electrons with IS state
holes and peak 2 at 435 nm is observed due to the recombination of
IZn electrons with valance band holes.43−47

Figure 5 Schematic depiction of the emission mechanism in Zn–Ga–S
ternary QDs. Since ZnS has a larger band gap than Ga2S3, the Zn–Ga–S band gap lies between both of
these band gaps. Process 1 is recombination from the conduction band
edge to IS states. Process 2 is recombination from the
IZn level to the top of the valance band edge. Process
3 is recombination of VS states to the valance band edge.
Finally, process 4 involves recombination from the conduction band
edge to VZn, IZn to VZn, and VS to VZn and VGa states.

In the case of vacancies, a similar discussion can be applied.
A vacancy can be formed when an atom is absent from its native site.
It also puts lattice strain in the crystal by rearranging the neighboring
atoms. As we know that sulfur atoms have bigger atomic size than zinc,
sulfur vacancy (VS) levels are near to the conduction band
edge than those of zinc vacancies (VZn) states.42−46 Therefore, we attribute peak 3 at 460 nm to radiative recombination
of VS state electrons with valance band holes and emission
4 initiates from recombination of conduction band electrons with VZn state holes.44−46 Furthermore, the peak 4 has larger FWHM than any
other peaks, so it could be originated from multiple defect states.
As we have observed the Ga2S3 phase in all samples
from XRD and Raman measurements, gallium vacancies (VGa) are also formed and could lie just above (at 0.7 eV) the valance
band edge of Ga2S3.35,38 In Figure S2 of the Supporting Information,
it has been shown that the width of tail emission increases with increasing
Ga concentration in Zn–Ga–S QDs. Accordingly, it also
suggests that the tail of peak 4 arises from the contribution of gallium
states since it contains broad emission ranging from 450 to 650 nm.
Therefore, we can conclude that peak 4 also originates from VS to VGa states.35,38 In addition,
the emission 4 may be contributed from other defect states, including
IZn to VZn and VS to VZn as observed in the previous reports.44,47

3 Conclusions
In summary, we examined photophysical properties
of highly luminescent
Zn–Ga–S ternary QDs by varying the Zn/Ga ratio. The
notion of multiphase formation with ZnGa2S4,
ZnS, and Ga2S3 in these ternary QDs was supported
by XRD patterns as well as Raman spectra. Three optical transitions
were recognized, two being from valance to conduction band and the
other from sub-band-gap defect states, contributing to the absorption
as well as in excitation spectra of these QDs. Moreover, multiple
emission was observed in these QDs arising from interstitial and vacancy
defects formed within the band gap of the QDs. The dominating radiative
mechanism in the higher-wavelength region is believed to be DAP recombination
occurring from these defects sites. Therefore, understanding of photophysical
properties of these ternary Zn–Ga–S QDs can be a benefit
for obtaining highly efficient QDs for LEDs and photovoltaic devices.
