Photocure kinetics of acrylated epoxidized soybean oil
(AESO) was
studied via photocalorimetry without adding any diluent/comonomer,
in the presence of two different photoinitiators, namely, 2,2-dimethoxy
phenylacetophenone and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone. The effect
of varying photoinitiator concentration, light intensity, and temperature
on the extent of crosslinking was calculated from the ratio of experimentally
measured reaction enthalpy to the theoretical enthalpy of reaction
(ΔHtheoretical). Photocuring of
AESO was observed to be a second-order reaction exhibiting autocatalytic
behavior. Nevertheless, due to the occurrence of vitrification, incomplete
crosslinking (α ≠ 1) was observed in most curing conditions.
Rate constants and activation energies were determined using both
nonlinear model-fitting and model-free isoconversional methods. Activation
energy, as determined from the model-free isoconversional method,
was observed to increase as the reaction proceeded, indicating the
shift in cure mechanism from kinetic-controlled to diffusion-controlled.
Finally, the reaction termination mechanism was observed to be a combination
of second-order and primary radical termination mechanisms.

1 Introduction
Photocuring of thermosets,
especially multifunctional acrylates,
is commonly used in coatings, lithography, liquid optically clear
adhesives, and screen printing1 due to
its faster curing, superior performance, reduced emission of volatile
organic compounds, and lower costs.1−3 Conventionally, these
multifunctional acrylates have been derived from crude oil, a fossil
resource, thereby generating concerns regarding their ecological viability.1 To address this, initial efforts4−9 have been made to explore triglyceride-based bioacrylates as sustainable
alternatives. Yet, among these efforts, only three studies4,5,8 have attempted to monitor the
progression of cure with time. Further, all of these efforts4,5,8 fail to dwell in greater detail
on understanding the photocure kinetics of these bioacrylates, be
it determining their reaction propagation and termination mechanisms
or understanding the influence of various process parameters (such
as the type and concentration of the photoinitiator used, light intensity,
or temperature) on activation energies and rate constants of the cure
reaction.10 This makes it challenging to
exploit the full potential of these triglyceride-based acrylate systems,
as a detailed knowledge base on their photocure kinetics is necessary
for selecting appropriate process conditions. Unfortunately, the knowledge
on cure kinetics of crude oil-based acrylates cannot be extended to
triglyceride-based bioacrylates due to significant differences in
their molecular architecture.11−14 Typically, conventional acrylates possess a cyclic
aliphatic or aromatic backbone with acrylic groups present as the
end group. However, triglyceride-based bioacrylates possess an aliphatic
backbone consisting of three fatty acid chains attached to the glycerol
center, where the acrylic group is in the middle of the fatty acid
chain.14 This variance highlights the need
for a detailed study that provides a holistic analysis of photocure
kinetics of triglyceride-based acrylates.

Generally, photocure
kinetics of any material is studied using
two techniques: photocalorimetry (i.e., photo-differential scanning
calorimetery (DSC) and real-time Fourier transform infrared (RT-FTIR)
spectroscopy.15,16 While photo-DSC enables us to
monitor cure kinetics by measuring the change in enthalpy during curing,
RT-FTIR monitors the change in intensity of IR absorption spectra
of any specific functional group.17 Although
RT-FTIR provides useful insight about the rate of chemical reaction,
particularly when more than one reacting species is involved, making
it a complementary technique to photo-DSC, it also suffers from several
limitations. First, RT-FTIR offers poor temperature control, which
when combined with the exothermic nature of the cure reaction, makes
it difficult to maintain isothermal conditions during the process,
resulting in inaccurate kinetics calculations.18 Second, this technique produces a large amount of raw spectra
for just a single experiment, making it extremely difficult to analyze
the entire gamut of results for any given sample/reaction, even as
these results are susceptible to any phase or baseline changes.19 Finally, RT-FTIR is a surface-based technique
when carried out via ATR mode, i.e., it determines the extent of curing
only at the surface for thick samples due to the inability of the
infrared beam to penetrate through the sample.20,21 In contrast, photo-DSC remains the oldest technique available to
analyze the photocure kinetics of any reaction in a highly reliable
and robust manner.22,23 Additionally, photo-DSC helps
us obtain the average degree of cure for the material as a whole.
Together, all of these aspects render the photo-DSC technique advantageous
over RT-FTIR in developing a holistic understanding of the kinetics
of any material/substance.

Even as the photo-DSC technique can
provide us adequate and optimal
experimental data, any true study of reaction kinetics is only possible
by analyzing such results using kinetic models. Typically, reaction
kinetics is studied either via model-fitting method and/or model-free
isoconversional method.24 Of these two
types of methods, model-free isoconversional methods are well-known
for being more realistic and accurate in predicting reaction kinetics,
as they are free from any assumptions and determine the variation
in activation energy with progression of the reaction.25−27 Nevertheless, since their inception, such methods have been mainly
used to understand nonisothermal reaction kinetics, with model-fitting
methods used predominantly in the case of their isothermal counterparts.25,28 This can be ascribed to the premise that isoconversional methods
are inaccurate for isothermal kinetics but are accurate for nonisothermal
reactions, a premise that arose from the initial use of isoconversional
methods for thermal degradation reactions.25,28 However, photocuring of any thermoset under isothermal conditions
leads to gelation and vitrification of the polymer, an isoconversional
phenomenon.29 This suggests that determining
photocure kinetics via isoconversional methods may give useful insights
about the reaction that may otherwise not be obtainable via use of
model-fitting methods.

Hence, this work aims at comprehensively
understanding the photocure
kinetics of a triglyceride-based bioacrylate by monitoring it using
photocalorimetry. In a prior work30 from
our group, photo-DSC was used to characterize the cure kinetics of
an unsaturated polyester resin, containing 45 wt % styrene as a diluent,
where the derivations were targeted at model-based process control
and optimization. In this study, we chose acrylated epoxidized soybean
oil (AESO) as the bioacrylate and used two different photoinitiators
(PIs) belonging to the Type-I category (radical formation via unimolecular
bond cleavage), namely, 2,2-dimethoxy phenylacetophenone (DMPA) and
1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (HCPK), without the presence of
any diluent/comonomer. While DMPA possesses a short-lived excited
triplet state and exhibits a yellowing character,31 HCPK is a nonyellowing PI that is widely used for curing
acrylate monomers.32 Experimental observations,
as noted for varying process conditions, were analyzed using both
the model-fitting method and isothermal model-free isoconversional
method10,33 to assess their relative suitability in
understanding the reaction kinetics of such systems. Finally, the
light intensity exponent (β) was estimated to determine the
termination mechanism of the curing reaction.

2 Background on Cure Kinetics
2.1 Model-Fitting Method
In general,
heat flow, measured using photo-DSC, is assumed to occur solely due
to one reaction, namely, the crosslinking of acrylate groups that
are present in the AESO molecule. This assumption is valid in this
work due to the absence of any solvent and/or comonomer. Hence, the
rate of conversion (or crosslinking) (Rp or dα/dt) can be calculated
using eq 1,(34) where
ΔHtotal is the total enthalpy of
the reaction at 100% crosslinking and dH/dt is the heat flow measured under any isothermal DSC condition. 1  Upon integrating eq 1, the degree of conversion (α) can be
obtained from eq 2, where
ΔHtotal is the total enthalpy of
a reaction at 100% crosslinking (i.e., α = 1).20,34 2  To understand the variation in α with
time, i.e., the progression of cure (or its kinetics), several cure
kinetics models, both phenomenological and mechanistic ones, have
been proposed and well discussed in the literature.24,35,36 These models can be classified into two
groups: nth order models that can be further categorized
into accelerating and decelerating reaction models and autocatalytic
reaction models. However, according to the International Confederation
for Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (ICTAC) Review Committee recommendations,24 for a cure kinetics model to be reliable and
robust, it is necessary that the model is capable of taking into account
the variation in the extent of conversion (α) via both the nth order and autocatalytic reaction models.24 One such model that has been widely used to
understand cure kinetics of various systems is the Kamal–Sourour36 model, which is expressed using eq 3. Here, dα/dt is the rate of reaction, k1 and k2 are the rate constants that correspond to
the nth order and autocatalytic reaction models,
while m and n refer to the orders
of crosslinking and monomer consumption, respectively. 3  However, it is widely known that during the
isothermal cure of a thermoset, the cure reaction can cease due to
the formation of a glassy phase that traps free radicals, thereby
preventing cure completion (i.e., α ≠ 1). Hence, the
Kamal–Sourour36 model was modified,
as shown in eq 4, to
capture this incomplete cure, where the term “1” in eq 3 is replaced by αmax, which refers to the maximum degree of conversion that
can occur (such that αmax ≤ 1) during the
reaction. 4  Since the objective of this study was to determine
the optimal values for all cure kinetic parameters, i.e., reaction
rate constants (k1, k2) and reaction orders (m, n), these were obtained by matching model-predicted dα/dt (obtained using eq 4) as closely possible with experimentally
measured dα/dt values through curve fitting.
Mathematically, such close matching between model-predicted and experimentally
measured values of dα/dt is undertaken by using
the cost function (defined in eq 5) 5  Here, RSS is the residual sum of least squares, N is the total number of data samples, i is the time index, Rp exp is the
experimentally measured rate of cure, and Rp calc is the model-predicted rate of cure. Essentially, the model functions
on the premise of minimizing RSS, with the lowest value of RSS obtained
for the most accurate values of all four desired parameters. Upon
determining the values of (k1, k2), activation energy (Ea) of the curing reaction can be calculated using the Arrhenius
equation (defined in eq 6), where A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol K)), and T is the temperature (K). 6  

2.2 Model-Free Isoconversional Method
Since model-fitting methods are well-known for giving Arrhenius parameter
values (activation energy and rate constants) that are notoriously
uncertain,37 the recent ICTAC Review Committee
has recommended the use of model-free isoconversional methods to predict
the kinetic behavior of a chemical reaction in a realistic manner.24 In this regard, activation energy (Ea,α) must be determined at different values of α
= 0.05–0.95 with a step size of not larger than 0.05 for a
better understanding of cure kinetics over time. Hence, a simplified
form of the integral isoconversional method (eq 7) was selected to understand and predict the
photocure kinetics of AESO, where tα,i refers to the time taken to reach a particular
extent of degree of conversion (α) at different temperatures
(Ti) and Ea,α is the activation energy of reaction for the
specific value of α. 7  Using a linearfit for the plot between ln(tα,i) and the reciprocal
of isothermal test temperature (Ti), the slope was used to determine Ea,α as a function of α.

2.3 Termination Mechanism: Light Intensity Exponent
To determine the termination mechanism of the cure reaction, experimentally
obtained dα/dt values were
fitted as a function of α using eq 8 to estimate the light intensity exponent (β).1,38 Here, dα/dt is the rate
of reaction, k(p) is a parameter
that depends on the extent of conversion (α), x and β are exponents, and I0 refers
to the intensity of UV radiation incident on the sample (in mW/cm2). 8  

3 Results
3.1 Change in Reaction Enthalpy and Time under
Different Process Conditions
Tables 1 and 2, respectively,
detail total reaction enthalpies and peak reaction times obtained
during the photocuring of AESO under different processing conditions
(varying PI concentration, UV light intensity, and temperatures),
for both the low-intensity (50, 100, and 150 mW/cm2) (Supporting
Information, Figure S1) and medium-intensity
(1500, 2500, and 3500 mW/cm2) (Supporting Information, Figure S2) batches. As can be seen, an increase
in intensity from the low-intensity to the medium-intensity regime
led to an increase in reaction enthalpy along with a significant decrease
(>50%) in reaction time. This observation was consistent, irrespective
of the type of PI, UV intensity, and/or temperature used. Further,
the reaction time for the HCPK-initiated reaction was much higher
than for DMPA-initiated reaction at lower PI concentration and temperature
in both low- and medium-intensity regimes.

The extent of conversion (α), under all tested
conditions,
was calculated using eq 2. With regard to this equation, in the case of photocure kinetics,
the general practice is to treat the enthalpy of a reaction obtained
at the highest reaction temperature (tested for) as its total enthalpy
(ΔHtotal).20,30,34 This practice assumes that the cure reaction
is complete at the highest reaction temperature, resulting in α
= 1. Nonetheless, from Table 1, it is clear that the highest enthalpy of crosslinking reaction
(−141 J/g) was obtained at the highest UV radiation intensity
(150 mW/cm2) and lowest reaction temperature (25 °C),
and not at the highest reaction temperature (75 °C), when HCPK
was used as PI. Also, upon comparing Tables 1 and 2, it is evident
that for the same PI concentration and temperature, reaction enthalpy
increased with an increase in light intensity (to 1500/2500/3500 mW/cm2). This indicates that any further increase in reaction temperature
and/or UV intensity, beyond the tested conditions in this study, may
lead to a further increase in enthalpy beyond values obtained in this
work. Hence, the aforementioned practice in photocure kinetics studies20,30,34 of choosing the highest enthalpy
obtained as ΔHtotal of the reaction
can lead to unrealistic conclusions on cure kinetics. Therefore, to
obtain a realistic understanding of the extent of conversion (α),
it is critical to calculate ΔHtotal using a theoretical method.

3.2 Theoretical Heat of Reaction
While
the theoretical heat of reaction has been previously calculated in
the literature for simple molecules, such as methyl acrylate and diepoxies,39 there still exists a lack of clarity on determining
the theoretical heat of reaction for complex molecules such as triglycerides.
Typically, eq 9 can be
used to calculate the theoretical heat of reaction (ΔHtheoretical) for a complex molecule (such as
triglyceride), where f is the number of reactive
sites per mole of the monomer, C is the fraction
of the monomer used in final chemical composition, H is the energy (in Joules) per mole of the reactive site, and MW
is the molecular weight of the monomer (in grams/mole). 9  While, in the literature,40 it has been mentioned that there can be a maximum of 4.2
acrylate groups in the acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO), it
is difficult to attain complete acrylation of epoxidized soybean oil
resulting in reduction in the number of acrylate groups. Hence, to
determine the extent of acrylation in the AESO, 1H NMR
spectroscopy was carried out. From Figure S3 (Supporting Information), the functionality of AESO used in this
study was determined as 2.5. Based on this, the average molecular
weight (MW) was calculated as ∼1120 g/mol. Enthalpy of the
reaction (ΔH) was considered to be −86.2
kJ per acrylate double bond,39,41 while the value of C (or fraction of monomer) was assumed to be 1, as no solvents
or comonomers were used in this work. Based on these details and eq 1, the theoretical heat
of reaction (ΔHtheoretical) for
100% conversion of the double bond in the AESO molecule was calculated
to be −192.41 J/g. Using this value as ΔHtotal, the degree/extent of conversion (α) was calculated
using eq 2 for all test
conditions and has been plotted for the low- and medium-intensity
batches in Figures 1a–f and 2a–f, respectively.

3.3 Effect of Photoinitiator Type and Concentration
on the Extent of Cure
From Figures 1a–f and 2a–f,
it is evident that the extent of crosslinking did not reach unity
(α ≠ 1) for any tested conditions, while the maximum
curing of 98% was obtained when DMPA was used as PI and cured at 75
°C. Also, upon comparing both these figures, it is clear that
the curing reaction reached completion within 40 s for the medium-intensity
regime, while it continued for the entire 120 s duration in the low-intensity
regime. As can be seen from Figure 1 (for the low-intensity regime), the extent of cure
was observed to increase with the increase in PI concentration (be
it DMPA or HCPK), UV intensity, and/or temperature. However, in the
case of the medium-intensity regime (Figures 2a,b), while the increase in DMPA concentration
did not alter the extent of curing (α), a significant increase
in α was observed with the increase in HCPK concentration. On
the other hand, Figure 2c,f shows that α increased with an increase in isothermal temperature,
irrespective of the PI used. Further, the rate of reaction was also
observed to differ in both intensity regimes, being much slower in
the low-intensity regime compared to the medium-intensity regime (Figures 1 and 2). Additionally, for both intensity regimes, DMPA-containing
samples showed a higher reaction rate (i.e., faster reaction) than
HCPK-containing samples. In contrast, for both PIs, an increase in
intensity beyond 1500 mW/cm2 did not significantly influence
either the curing rate (dα/dt) or the extent
of curing (α).

4 Kinetic Analysis
4.1 Model-Fitting Method
Initially, experimentally
obtained dα/dt vs α
curves were fitted using the Kamal–Sourour model (eq 3) to understand cure kinetics. The
error between the model-predicted and experimentally obtained dα/dt values (as a function of α) was minimized using
the objective function (value of RSS) shown in eq 5. Figure 3 shows experimentally obtained and model-predicted
curves for dα/dt as a function of α.
A poor fit was observed between the two sets of values, indicating
that the Kamal–Sourour model failed to predict the experimental
observations in a realistic manner. This is mainly due to the assumption
made by this model that α reaches unity (i.e., complete crosslinking
occurs),33,42 while Figures 1 and 2 clearly show
that crosslinking of AESO was not complete. Hence, to account for
incomplete cure that occurs under isothermal conditions, the modified
Kamal’s model (eq 4) was used to fit experimentally obtained dα/dt values (as a function of α). The objective function (eq 5) was used to minimize
the error between model-predicted and experimentally observed values
and accurately determine both reaction rate constants (k1, k2) and reaction orders
(m, n). Figure 4a,b shows model-predicted and experimentally
obtained dα/dt values (as a function of α)
for both PIs (DMPA and HCPK) at varying isothermal temperature conditions.
As can be seen, the modified Kamal–Sourour model exhibited
good fit with experimental values, indicating its suitability in explaining
the experimental observations of photocuring of AESO. Based upon this
fitting, the values of rate constants (k1, k2) and reaction orders (m, n) were obtained and have been reported in Table 3.

75	0	0.65	0.58	1.54	2.128	0.93	0.00137	
As can be seen from Table 3, at all temperature conditions (25, 50,
and 75 °C),
the value of k1 is obtained as zero, indicating
that the reaction has no nth-order component and
is solely an autocatalytic reaction.36 Also, m + n ≅ 2, indicating that the cure
reaction is a second-order reaction. Thus, from the determined rate
constant k2, the activation energy (Ea) of the autocatalyzed crosslinking reaction
was calculated via the Arrhenius equation (eq 6), and the respective values have been provided
in Table 3.

4.2 Model-Free Isoconversional Method
To understand the variation in activation energy (Ea,α) with the progression of cure (i.e., the extent
of conversion/crosslinking or α), along with cure kinetics in
a holistic manner, a model-free isoconversional method was also employed
in this study. Initially, plots between ln tα,i and 1000/Ti were obtained, and a linear fit was
attained for all experimental values at varying α values, as shown in Figure 5 for DMPA as PI. The slope of this linear fit provided the
activation energy values (Ea,α)
at different α, which were then subsequently plotted (Figure 6) to demonstrate
the variation in activation energy (Ea,α) as a function of α. As shown, the activation energy of the
curing reaction increased with the progression of the reaction, indicating
that the reaction is very complex.

conversion in the range
of 0.05–0.75 for AESO containing 2 wt % DMPA as the photoinitiator.

AESO samples photocured using two different photoinitiators (DMPA
and HCPK).

4.3 Light Intensity Exponent: Termination Mechanism
The termination mechanism of the curing reaction was also analyzed
by using the light intensity exponent method (eq 8). In general, for this method, the value
of x is assumed to be 1 during modeling to determine
the value of light intensity exponent (β),1,43 while
keeping in mind the aforementioned RSS principle (eq 5), i.e., obtaining the least sum
of squared errors. Based on this assumption (x =
1), β was obtained in the range of 0.1–0.3 for all reaction
conditions, i.e., β < 0.5. This indicates that termination
of curing occurred via the combination of two mechanisms: (a) primary
radical termination or the reaction between free radicals derived
from the AESO molecule and PI radicals, which prevent crosslinking
between two AESO-based radicals, and (b) second-order termination
or the reaction between two AESO-based radicals, which actually stops
further crosslinking from taking place.

5 Discussion
5.1 Effect of Vitrification on the Extent of Cure
Multiple studies have reported incomplete curing (i.e., α
≠ 1) during isothermal cure conditions, irrespective of the
material used and/or the cure mechanism that occurs.20,31,35,44 Such behavior is commonly known as “vitrification”,
described as the transformation of a polymer from its liquid/rubbery
state to its glassy state due to the crosslinking of polymeric chains.
This is typically accompanied by an increase in its viscosity as well
as reduced mobility of both PI and AESO species, which leads to a
drastic decrease in the subsequent rate of reaction.20,31,35,44 As a result, the reaction ceases prior to cure completion (i.e.,
α does not reach 1), while the remaining functional groups are
left behind as unreacted groups.45

It is widely known and understood that for any photocuring reaction,
an increase in any one of the three processing parameters, light (UV)
intensity, photoinitiator (PI) concentration, or temperature, will
increase the rate and extent of curing (i.e., dα/dt and α, respectively) due to the increase in the number of
free radicals available for reaction propagation.9,30 However,
for the medium-intensity batch in this study, DMPA concentration was
observed to not cause any change in either the cure rate or the extent
of curing (Figure 2a). Similar observations have also been reported earlier by Mucci
and Vallo46 in their work on analyzing
the photopolymerization of methacrylate monomers using DMPA as PI.
They have attributed this behavior to the screening effect because
of the increase in UV absorbance of samples that contained ≥
0.25 wt % of DMPA. In other words, at higher UV intensities (comparable
to those employed in the medium-intensity batch in this study), the
optimum PI concentration for obtaining the maximum extent of curing
is 0.25 wt % for DMPA.46 Beyond this value,
any further increase in PI concentration will accelerate the termination
process and will not contribute toward reaction propagation (i.e.,
curing). Since this study employs DMPA at higher concentrations (0.5,
1, 2, and 4 wt %) than this limit, variation in DMPA amount was observed
to have a negligible effect on crosslinking-related parameters for
the medium-intensity batch.

In contrast with this noninfluence
of DMPA concentration, the temperature
was seen to play a determining role for both the curing rate and the
extent of cure for the medium-intensity batch (Figure 2c). This is explained by the fact that an
increase in temperature enhanced the rate of reaction by increasing
the mobility of both PI and AESO species that hitherto remained unreacted
at lower temperatures. This, in turn, improved the ability of PI molecules
to cause photocuring of AESO. Interestingly, for the low-intensity
batch, the curing reaction was observed to occur beyond 120 s (Figure 1), thus indicating
that AESO molecules had undergone dark polymerization despite their
slower rate of curing.47 This occurrence
of dark polymerization, albeit at retarded rates, is at odds with
the conventional thought that considers free-radical polymerization
to stop upon switching off the UV light. However, such dark cure in
free-radical photopolymerization has also been reported lately in
difunctional methacrylate.47 This dark
cure was hypothesized to occur due to the retained activity of free
radicals that initially got trapped inside the crosslinked polymeric
network and subsequently cured any molecule that was available and
freely accessible for crosslinking in their surroundings, a phenomenon
commonly known as the “cage effect”.48

A stark difference was also observed in the reactivity
of the two
PIs (DMPA and HCPK) used in this study, as corroborated by lower peak
times (Tables 1 and 2) and higher/equivalent extent of curing (α, Figures 1 and 2) for DMPA-containing AESO samples over their HCPK-containing
counterparts. This can be ascribed to the faster cleavage of DMPA
that occurs within 100–200 ps,49 as measured via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy that
has a picosecond resolution.50 Further,
the decomposition rate constant (kd) of
DMPA has been previously estimated as 1011 s–1 by Kurdikar and Peppas.51 Such a high
rate constant indicates that decomposition of DMPA is a very fast
process. Conversely, HCPK needs more time for cleavage and subsequent
reaction with triglyceride molecules,32 which explains its slower reactivity vis-à-vis DMPA in this
study.

Finally, despite observing the vitrification phenomenon
under all
photo-DSC conditions, the acrylated triglyceride system employed in
this study (i.e., AESO) exhibited the highest rate constant till date
among all acrylates that are commonly used in photocure coatings.9,15 This means that AESO underwent faster curing (i.e., less time) than
other existing acrylates. Yet, at the same time, the AESO sample did
not show complete curing under any condition employed in this work,
which can be explained by the sole major limiting factor with such
systems, their higher functionality (f = 2.5). This
is in line with the existing literature,52 which shows that the functionality of an acrylate (f) is inversely proportional to its extent of conversion (or curing,
α). Such a relationship is the logical outcome of two key aspects:
an increase in total enthalpy (ΔHtotal) of the acrylate due to its higher functionality (eq 9) and the occurrence of the vitrification
phenomenon in the acrylate system upon its curing.

5.2 Activation Energy Dependence on Conversion
Based on the model-free isoconversional method employed in this
work (Figure 6), the
activation energy (Ea,α) of the
cure reaction was initially observed to increase linearly with α
but subsequently showed a drastic increase during the later stages
of the reaction. This increase was observed irrespective of the PI
used (DMPA or HCPK) and can be entirely attributed to the occurrence
of vitrification in AESO during its curing. An additional complementing
factor is the trapping of primary radical into the molecular network
of AESO, which inhibits its availability for further curing, thereby
stopping the cure reaction from taking place further. Interestingly,
activation energy was observed to be higher for HCPK-initiated samples
than for DMPA-initiated samples, when determined from both model-fitting
and model-free techniques. This can be ascribed to the fact that since
the photolysis product of HCPK is bulkier than that of DMPA, HCPK
molecules may experience severe steric hindrance upon migrating to
acrylate groups for undergoing crosslinking reaction. Hence, HCPK-containing
samples find it difficult to undergo crosslinking at higher α
values vis-à-vis their DMPA-containing counterparts, which
explains the difference in their respective activation energies at
a higher extent of conversion (α).

This variation in activation
energy with an increase in α also highlights the high complexity
of the crosslinking reaction, as reported elsewhere,24 from the point of view of cure kinetics, for it means that
a single rate equation cannot be used to explain/describe the cure
kinetics of AESO. This is because the vitrification of a polymer is
accompanied by a shift in the reaction mechanism (from chemical- to
diffusion-controlled) on account of change in its activation energy.24 Hence, the combination of vitrification, primary
radical trapping, and the subsequent transformation in the nature
of the curing reaction leads to significant differences in activation
energy (Ea,α) values obtained at
different degrees of conversion (α) vis-à-vis the activation
energy (Ea) value obtained using the modified
Kamal’s model (reported in Table 3). Further, it also establishes that the
model-free isoconversional method is more accurate and realistic in
predicting the cure reaction kinetics of AESO when compared to the
model-fitting method, as it can better capture the complexity of the
entire curing process. Thus, this study establishes the relatively
higher suitability of isoconversional methods over model-fitting methods
for analyzing the cure phenomenon of triglyceride-based bioacrylate.

6 Conclusions
Photocure kinetics of AESO,
a biobased acrylated triglyceride,
was studied via photo-DSC by using two different photoinitiators (DMPA
and HCPK). A method to determine the theoretical heat of reaction
for complex molecules is proposed. Irrespective of the photoinitiator
used, AESO exhibited autocatalytic behavior with the reaction order
obtained as ∼2. While modified Kamal’s model (or Kamal’s
model that accounts for vitrification) was observed to well-fit experimentally
obtained values for the extent of curing (α), the model-free
isoconversional method was found to accurately predict the photocure
kinetics of AESO. Variation in activation energy at varying degrees
of conversion was observed via the use of the model-free isoconversional
method. Finally, the light intensity exponent method indicated that
termination of the curing reaction occurred via the combination of
primary radical termination and second-order termination mechanisms.
The outcome of this work will enable the selection of optimal cure
conditions for triglyceride-based bioacrylates for various applications.
In particular, the knowledge provided in this work on UV curability
of AESO in the presence of a nonyellowing HCPK initiator will enable
its use in diverse applications, such as liquid optically clear adhesives
and screen printing.

7 Experimental Section
7.1 Materials
Acrylated epoxidized soybean
oil (AESO), containing 4000 ppm of monomethyl ether hydroquinone as
an inhibitor (Viscosity: 18000–32000 cps and an acid value
of < 10 mg KOH/g), was used as a photocurable bioacrylate resin.
Two photoinitiators, namely, 2,2-dimethoxy phenylacetophenone (DMPA)
and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (HCPK), were used. All of the
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, MI, USA and used in the
as-received state. An appropriate quantity of the photoinitiators
was added to the AESO and hand-mixed. Both the photoinitiators were
observed to dissolve in the resin completely.

7.2 Photocalorimetry
NETZSCH Photo-DSC
204 F1 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), equipped with a UV
lamp (OmniCure S2000) through a single light guide, was used to monitor
the photocure kinetics of AESO under a nitrogen atmosphere at a flow
rate of 40 ml/min. Approximately, 2–5 mg of samples was taken
in an open aluminum pan for each DSC test/experiment. Both the reference
and sample pans were exposed to UV radiation in the wavelength region
of 320–500 nm for 120 s with a delay of 5 s. The influence
of PI concentration (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 wt%), temperature (25, 50 and
75 °C), and light intensity on photocure kinetics of AESO was
studied. Light intensity was monitored at the end of the light guide
and was varied in two batches: a low-intensity batch/regime of 50,
100, and 150 mW/cm2 and a medium-intensity batch/regime
of 1500, 2500, and 3500 mW/cm2. In both the cases, the
intensity experienced by the sample was ∼ 50 times53 lower. To monitor the occurrence of any chemical
reaction solely due to thermal energy, samples were held in isothermal
conditions (at their respective temperature profile) for 5 min prior
to exposing them to UV radiation for 120 s. No heat flow was observed
during the initial 5 min of isothermal condition, indicating that
the thermal energy provided did not induce any curing reaction. Further,
for each experiment, samples were subjected to a second UV irradiation
cycle to monitor the occurrence of any residual reaction. The absence
of peak(s) during this second irradiation cycle (under all conditions)
indicates the completion of the reaction during the first irradiation
cycle.

7.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out on AESO using 300
MHz Bruker Avance (Billerica, MA), at 5341 MHz spectral width and
3.0 s acquisition time. A concentration of 50 mg/ml of AESO to CDCl3
was utilized, and 16 scans were collected.
