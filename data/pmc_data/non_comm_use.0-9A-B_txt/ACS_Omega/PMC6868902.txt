Cofiring characteristics of raw or torrefied bamboo and masson
pine blends with different blend ratios were investigated by cone
calorimetry, and its ash performance from cofiring was also determined
by a YX-HRD testing instrument, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results
showed that bamboo and masson pine had the different physicochemical
properties. Torrefaction improved fuel performances, resulting in
a more stable cofiring process. It also decreased the heat release
rate, total heat release, and total suspended particulates of fuels,
especially CO2 and CO release. Masson pine ash mainly included
CaO, SiO2, Fe2O3, K2O,
and Al2O3. Bamboo ash was mainly composed of
K2O, SiO2, MgO, and SO3. There were
different melting temperatures and trends between different samples.
The synergistic reaction of ash components was found during the cofiring
process. The surface morphology of blend ash changed with the variation
of bamboo or masson pine content.

1 Introduction
Cofiring technology
is widely regarded as a promising way to use
biomass as a solid fuel with some advantages such as improving combustion
efficiency and reducing pollutant emissions, and so forth. Cofiring
of waste biomass and coal could improve ignition and carbon combustion
properties of coal.1 Cofiring wood and
wheat straw pellets could improve the thermal decomposition of blends
and combustion of volatiles.2 Tokarski
et al.3 concluded that cofiring of biomass
fuels had the minimum energy consumption and the maximum efficiency
of power generation, compared with individual combustion of biomass.
Furthermore, the release of main nitrogenous gases (HCN, NH3, NO, and HNCO) also decreased in different blends of biomass (corn
straw, cotton stalk, and wheat straw) with municipal sewage sludge
during the cofiring process.4 Kwong et
al.5 confirmed that gaseous pollutant emissions
including carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen
oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) decreased when bamboo was added to coal. Therefore, cofiring
technology could improve combustion characteristic of fuels and provide
a better control of emissions with some economic benefits.

Bamboo
is a type of biomass resource with great potential to be used as a
solid fuel because of fast growth, low ash content, alkali index (AI),
and heating value. Similar to other biomass, bamboo also has some
disadvantages to limit its energy application, such as a low energy
density, a high moisture content, a high value of collection, storage
and transportation, and so forth. Torrefaction is considered as a
good technology to solve these problems. Bamboo underwent chemical
changes related to carbonyl groups, mostly present in hemicelluloses,
and to aromatic groups present in lignin during the torrefaction process.6 The calorific value of bamboo also increased
from 17.60 to 23 and 28 MJ/kg when it was torrefied at a temperature
of 250 and 380 °C.7 Liu et al.8 concluded that the presence of bamboo and torrefied
bamboo improved the thermochemical reactivity of bamboo and coal blends
during the cofiring process. Mi et al.9 found that the cofiring process of torrefied bamboo, torrefied wood,
and their blends included drying, oxidative pyrolysis, and char combustion.
Cone calorimetry has been widely used to determine flame retardant
properties of materials.10 It can comprehensively
evaluate combustion characteristics based on these parameters including
heat release rate, total heat release (THR), time to ignition, mass
loss rate, total suspended particulates (TSP), specific extinction
area, effective heat of combustion, and the yield of CO and CO2. Our group published the cofiring characteristics of raw/torrefied
bamboo and masson pine or coal using thermogravimetric analysis. To
the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of sufficient information
concerning the cofiring characteristics of bamboo and masson pine
by using cone calorimetry. The combustion characteristics from cone
calorimetry is very helpful to further comprehensively evaluate cofiring
characteristics of bamboo and masson pine. Therefore, raw or torrefied
bamboo and masson pine were, respectively, mixed with different blend
ratios of 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20. Combustion performance of
the blends were determined by cone calorimetry at a heat flux of 50
kW/m2. Ash characteristics from the cofiring process of
bamboo and masson pine were also investigated by X-ray fluorescence
(XRF), a YX-HRD testing instrument, SEM, and TEM. The results from
this research will further develop bamboo and masson pine residues
to be used as solid fuels.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physico-Chemical Characteristics of Blends
The proximate
and ultimate analysis and the high heating value of samples are showed
in Table 1. The physico-chemical
properties of bamboo were similar to those of masson pine, even though
bamboo had a slightly high content of ash, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur,
oxygen, and higher heating value (HHV). Torrefaction improved the
fuel properties of bamboo and masson pine, increasing fixed carbon
(FC), carbon content, HHV, and decreasing volatiles, moisture, and
oxygen. This was attributed to the decarboxylation of biomass in the
process of torrefaction, releasing in the form of water, carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, and oxygen-containing carbohydrates.11 Furthermore, a decrease in the moisture content of torrefied
masson pine and bamboo was beneficial for the fuel to be more easily
ignited and to reach higher temperatures.12 The HHV of masson pine and bamboo, respectively, increased from
18.20 to 25.92 MJ/kg and from 18.70 to 25.47 MJ/kg after they were
torrefied. Chen et al.13 found that carbon,
hydrogen, or FC were the primary sources of HHV by calculating correlations
in terms of proximate, elemental, or fiber analysis. The HHV increase
of torrefied masson pine and bamboo was mainly because of the increase
of carbon (from 51.55 and 49.53 to 67.51 and 65.65%, respectively)
and FC (from 15.21 and 15.20 to 43.18 and 44.58%, respectively). Ash,
moisture, and carbon content of the samples had a slight decrease
with the increase of bamboo content in blends. In contrast, the content
of FC, carbon, and HHV significantly increased. Compared with raw
biomass, the content of ash, FC, moisture, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
HHV increased with the increase of torrefied bamboo content in the
blends. Furthermore, the effect of blend ratios on the proximate and
ultimate analysis of bamboo and masson pine blends was more significant
than that of torrefied biomass blends. This confirmed that torrefaction
improved fuel properties, resulting in them having more similar physico-chemical
performance.

2.2 Cofiring
Characteristics
HRR is the rate of heat release per unit
area of the burning sample, which is considered as the most important
parameter to characterize the flame strength. Figure 1 shows the HRR curves of the cofiring process
for raw and torrefied bamboo and masson pine. There are two distinct
release peaks for the cofiring process of raw bamboo and masson pine.
But only one peak was found during the cofiring process of torrefied
bamboo and masson pine. The first peak corresponds to the maximum
value of HRR, which is called as the peak heat release rate (PHRR).
The PHRR from the cofiring process of raw biomass was obviously higher
than that of the torrefied biomass, which was attributed to the heat
release of volatile combustion. Table 1 confirms that all blends of raw biomass had a higher
volatile content than the torrefied biomass. Furthermore, the blends
of the torrefied biomass had a lower volatile fuel ratio [VM/(VM +
FC)] than the blends of raw bamboo or masson pine. This indicated
that the blends of torrefied bamboo and masson pine had a lower thermal
reactivity and higher ignition temperature because a lot of flammable
volatiles were pyrolyzed during the torrefaction process.14 The values of the first exothermic peak were
378.6–470.4 kW/m2 for raw biomass blends under different
blend ratios, which were also obviously higher than that of the blends
of the torrefied biomass. And the second peaks of the blends of raw
biomass were broad peaks with values of 160.4 and 202.4 kW/m2. The second exothermic peak was because of the formation of a protective
carbon layer during the combustion process.15 The samples under the carbon layer were burned because of higher
volatile content, which formed the second peak.16 Compared with the cofiring process of raw biomass, torrefied
biomass with different blend ratios had a more stable combustion process.
This indicated that torrefaction improved the combustion properties,
which can convert bamboo and masson pine with nonuniform qualities
into a highly homogenous solid fuel.

Figure 1 HRR curves of all the
samples (a) raw bamboo and masson pine; (b) torrefied bamboo and masson
pine.

Figure 2 shows THR curves of the cofiring process.
THR is the total amount of heat released per unit area of the material
during the combustion process. The combination of HRR and THR can
be used to evaluate the combustion characteristics of a material.
There were three stages during the cofiring process of raw biomass.
The THR rapidly increased at the first stage corresponding to the
first peak of HHR because volatiles from the surface of the samples
were ignited. The second stage corresponded to the second peak of
HHR, which had a slightly slower THR than the first stage. The carbon
layer on the surface of the samples hindered oxygen or air entry,
resulting in slower combustion of the samples. The third stage had
the slowest THR because of char burning. This also confirmed that
flame combustion had a faster THR than char burning during the cofiring
process of raw biomass. The cofiring process of torrefied biomass
had two burning stages. The first stage with relatively rapid THR
was flame combustion. Then char burning also resulted in a stable
increase of THR. It was further confirmed that the exothermic stability
of the samples was improved after torrefaction.

Figure 2 THR curves of all the samples (a) raw bamboo
and masson pine; (b)
torrefied bamboo and masson pine.

The exhaust
gas emission-related parameters are also an important index to evaluate
the combustion properties of fuels. Figure 3 shows the TSP of the cofiring process. For
blends of raw biomass, there were three stages of TSP, respectively,
corresponding to THR. Similarly, the blends of torrefied biomass had
two stages of TSP. Furthermore, the TSP of all the blends rapidly
increased at the flaming combustion stage, where the smoke contained
a large amount of incombustible volatiles. It was also obvious that
the blends of raw biomass had more TSP than the blends of torrefied
biomass. Some organic substances were not completely oxidized because
of low combustion temperatures, which promoted smoke release. This
phenomenon was related to the moisture content and volatiles of the
samples. Hellwig17 concluded that high
water content of biomass materials could lead to poor ignition. Table 1 confirms that raw
biomass also had a higher moisture content, resulting in fuels that
were more difficult to be ignited and to reach a higher temperature.12 Therefore, some volatiles of raw bamboo and
masson pine blends with higher moisture content were not oxidized
during this stage, especially for organic substances. This resulted
in increasing of smoke. Figure 3a shows that bamboo had the highest TSP. TSP also increased
with the bamboo content in blends, except for the blends of 40% bamboo
and 60% masson pine. It was very interesting that torrefied bamboo
had the lowest TSP, as shown in Figure 3b. This indicated that torrefaction could significantly
decrease the TSP of bamboo. The TSP of torrefied blends was between
bamboo and masson pine. But the effect of blend ratios on TSP was
irregular. The smoke release of the torrefied biomass was faster to
reach a steady stage, compared with the raw biomass. This phenomenon
was also because of the removal of some combustible substance during
the torrefaction process, resulting in a stable combustion process.

Figure 3 TSP curves
of all the samples (a) raw bamboo
and masson pine; (b) torrefied bamboo and masson pine.

The release of CO and CO2 were determined by cone calorimetry. Figure 4a,b shows CO emission
during the cofiring process. There were two shoulder peaks with a
similar trend. The CO release at the first stage was because of a
decarboxylation reaction of the alkyl side chain of the carbonyl functional
group (−CHO) contained in bamboo and masson pine.18,19 The release amount of CO slightly increased with the increase of
bamboo content in the blends. However, the CO release of torrefied
masson pine and bamboo blends remained at a stable level at different
blend ratios. This was mainly because of the pyrolysis of volatiles
in the samples during the torrefaction process, which decreased the
amount of −CHO. It was found that the main release of CO occurred
at the second stage, which was caused by the increase of temperature
and secondary reactions. Figure 4a shows that the peak corresponding to maximum CO release
occurred at 150 s, which was significantly higher than that at the
first stage. Figure 4b shows that the peak of maximum CO release began at 50 s for torrefied
bamboo and masson pine blends, which was obviously sooner than that
of raw biomass blends. This phenomenon was mainly caused by a longer
char burn process when torrefied masson pine and bamboo blends burned.
Based on the results of this research, the effect of torrefaction
on CO release was not significant. CO2 is also a major
component of greenhouse gases, which has a significant impact on the
environmental climate change. Figure 4c,d shows the emission of CO2 from the cofiring
process of raw/torrefied masson pine and bamboo blends. Raw masson
pine and bamboo blends had two peaks of CO2 emission, located
at a range of 0–50 and 72–100 s. Compared with CO release,
the first peak was the main CO2 release. This confirmed
that the CO2 emission was from the combustion of volatiles.
The second release peak was because of thermal cracking of the solid
residue in the fuels, oxidation of biochar, and high temperature thermal
decomposition. However, there was only one peak of CO2 emission
for torrefied masson pine and bamboo blends and its release amount
was significantly lower than raw biomass blends. It was because of
the decrease in the oxygen content of biomass after torrefaction.20 Furthermore, there was no significant variation
in the amount of CO2 released at different blend ratios.
It was interesting that CO2 release curve was similar with
the HRR curve, indicating that the heat release process was coincided
with CO2 release. It is well known that the mass loss of
bamboo and masson pine is mainly because of the oxidation of carbon
into CO2 and the conversion of hydrogen and oxygen into
water. Therefore, the dehydration reaction during the cofiring process
of torrefied biomass blends was more than that of raw biomass blends
according to the significant reduction in CO2 release from
torrefied biomass blends. In conclusion, the lower release of CO2 and CO from torrefied blends indicated that torrefied bamboo
and masson pine blends were environmentally friendly energy resources.
Especially, blend ratios had not a significant impact on CO and CO2 emissions of torrefied biomass blends, compared with raw
biomass blends.

2.3 Ash Characteristics
2.3.1 Chemical Compositions of Ash Samples
Table 2 summarizes the chemical composition of ash
samples. The major components were CaO (31.5%), SiO2 (21.8%),
Fe2O3 (11.1%), K2O (9.84%), and Al2O3 (8.53%) in the ash of masson pine, whose contents
were more than 80% of total ash. There were also other components,
such as MgO (4.98%), SO3 (3.79%), P2O5 (2.31%), and MnO (2.29%). However, bamboo ash was mainly composed
of K2O (41.7%), SiO2 (19.7%), MgO (14.2%), and
SO3 (7.97%), whose contents were also more than 80% of
total ash. It also included CaO (5.64%), P2O5 (5.09%), and MnO (2.03%). It was confirmed that the dominating elements
in the slag were silicon, potassium, calcium, and magnesium during
the cofiring of bamboo and masson pine. Although the main type of
chemical compositions in the ash of bamboo or masson pine were similar,
the contents was obviously different. The content of K2O, MgO, and SO3 in bamboo ash was significantly higher
than that of masson pine ash. In contrast, bamboo ash had a lower
content of CaO, Al2O3, and Fe2O3. For the ash of blends, the content of all major chemical
compositions was between bamboo and masson pine. The percentage of
MgO, P2O5, SO3, K2O, and
Cl in the ash of blends gradually increased, whereas the content of
Al2O3, CaO, and Fe2O3 gradually
decreased with increase in the bamboo content of blends. It’s
worth noting that the SiO2 content was the only species
that did not behave linearly with the changing blend ratio. Alao it
exhibited the lowest percentage with a value of 15.4% in the blend
of 40% bamboo and 60% masson pine. This was a key factor to be taken
into account when analyzing the characteristics of ash fusion. Chlorine
(Cl) is also a non-negligible component during the combustion of the
biomass fuel. It usually existed in the form of KCl or NaCl, which
was a pivotal inorganic element to promote the release of K and accelerated
the rate of corrosion and ash deposition.21,22Table 2 shows that the ash
of bamboo had a slightly higher content of Cl than masson pine. The
content of Cl gradually increased with increase in bamboo content
of the blends. Among the chemical compositions of all the ash samples,
there were three types of oxides. The acid oxides included SiO2, P2O5, and TiO2. The higher
concentration of acid oxides with a high ionic potential (Si4+ is 95.24 nm–1) was easy to form the low-melting
temperature products.23,24 The basic oxides included Na2O, K2O, MgO, CaO, and MnO2, which could
react with SiO2 and Al2O3 to form
low-MP alumino-silicate minerals.25 Al2O3 and Fe2O3 were classified
as amphoteric oxides. But Al2O3 was sometimes
classified as an acidic oxide and Fe2O3 as a
basic oxide. These chemical compositions affected ash fusion characteristics.

Table 3 shows ash
fusion indexes, which had been widely used as reliable decisions for
fusion tendency.24,26 Wang et al.27 concluded that all the ash samples represented a trend
of high possibility of melting and fusion if RB/A was more than 0.7, Fu was more
than 40, SR was lower than 65, and AI
was more than 0.34. The base-to-acid ratio (RB/A+P of 3.260 and RB/A of 3.014)
of bamboo ash was higher than that of masson pine (RB/A+P of 1.864 and RB/A of
1.792). This phenomenon was attributed to the higher content of K2O and MgO and the lower content of Al2O3 and TiO2 in bamboo ash. The value of RB/A+P or RB/A is commonly
used to forecast the tendency of fouling tendencies of ash. The AFT
included initial deformation temperature (DT), softening temperature
(ST), hemispherical temperature (HT), and flow temperature (FT). DT
was extensively deemed as an important index to evaluate ash fusion
characteristics of biomass ash.28,29Figure 5 shows AFT of all the ash samples. The DT
of masson pine ash (1194 °C) was higher than that of bamboo ash
(1065 °C). The variation of chemical compositions was ascribed
to this phenomenon. Even though the aluminum content (0.767%) was
low in bamboo ash, the alkali metal and alkaline earth metal were
high, such as K2O, CaO, and MgO. Their total content was
more than 60% of the total ash, which resulted in a decrease in AFT.
This was mainly due to the fact that these high content of substances
changed the stable network from tecto-silicates, ino-silicates, cyclo-silicates,
and soro-silicates to neso-silicates.25 Furthermore, most of the phosphorus in biomass ash existed in the
form of phytic acid or phytate, which could be converted to K-phosphates,
Mg-phosphates, K–Mg-phosphates, and phosphorus oxides.30 These P-rich substances also resulted in a decrease
in the AFT, which was closely associated with high sintering and slagging
tendencies of ash.31 Wang et al.32 concluded that an increase in P2O5 promoted the formation of the low melting phase in the ash.
This also resulted in a lower DT of bamboo ash than masson pine ash
(P2O5 in bamboo and masson pine ash were, respectively,
5.09 and 2.31%). It was found that the ST, HT, and FT of bamboo and
masson pine ash were relatively close. For the blends, the DT, ST,
HT, and FT of blend ashes gradually decreased when the bamboo content
of the blends increased from 0 to 60%. Then, they increased with increase
in the bamboo content of the blends from 60 to 100%. The fusion temperatures
of blend ashes were, respectively, lower than that of bamboo or masson
pine ash, confirming that there was a synergistic reaction of ash
component during the cofiring process of bamboo and masson pine.

the ash samples with different blend ratios.

2.3.2 Ash Surface Morphology
Ash fusion characteristics could be reflected by its surface morphology.33 The surface morphology of the ashes determined
by SEM and TEM are shown in Figures 6 and 7. It was found that the
surface morphology of the ashes significantly varied with the change
of bamboo content in the blends. Figure 6a–f shows the surface morphology of
masson pine and bamboo ash, respectively. The ash of masson pine included
many irregular snowflake particles (1–200 μm), which
were evenly distributed on the surface of ash. In contrast, there
was a less amount of aggregation on the surface of the bamboo ash.
The pores from the shrinkage of the fiber structure during the release
of the volatile matter resulted in these irregular microstructures.34 When less amount of bamboo was mixed with masson
pine, some small particle ashes gradually agglomerated and formed
large particles with partially smooth and rough surfaces (Figure 6b). With increase
in bamboo content of the blends, the aggregation on the surface of
ash particles became more and more evident and some white molten mineral
particles began to appear on larger particle molten surfaces (Figure 6c,d). This might
be ascribed to the loss of the original fiber structure of the raw
material, the rapid combustion of combustible elements, and the rapid
shrinkage of the raw materials, which eventually melted and blocked
the interior. With increase in the bamboo content, the phenomenon
of surface aggregation slowed down and the distribution loosened (Figure 6e). It was concluded
that the change of surface morphology of the blend ashes with different
blend ratios was consistent with the variation in its fusion temperature.

Compared with SEM, the morphology, surface texture, internal structure,
and higher resolution information of ash can also be further expressed
by TEM. The images (Figure 7) showed a variety of particle sizes (1–200 nm) with
irregular shapes and predominantly round outlines (Figure 7b–d). The presence of
round ash particles was due to the fact that they were produced by
the agglomeration of evaporating substances, especially those containing
S as it is a volatile element.35 And it
was also indicated that the minerals in the ash required a higher
temperature to reach a melting state. There were aggregates
of fine particles in some places on the ash surface, which resulted
in densification of the ash sample. This phenomenon was mainly because
of the high temperatures during repeated regeneration.

3 Conclusions
In
summary, the present study demonstrated the further potential of using
bamboo and masson pine residues as energy products. Torrefaction improved
the fuel properties and converted bamboo or masson pine from a nonuniformity
to a homogenous solid fuel, resulting in a more stable combustion
process of the samples. Furthermore, torrefaction deceased in the
release of HHR, THR, TSP, CO, and CO2. Torrefied bamboo
and masson pine blends were environmentally friendly energy resources.
The chemical composition of bamboo and masson pine ash affected its
fusion characteristics. Bamboo ash was
easier to occur slagging, agglomeration or corrosion than that of
masson pine. There was a synergistic reaction of ash components during
the cofiring process. The ash sample of 60% bamboo and 40% masson
pine had the lowest initial DT.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys
heterocycla) and masson pine (Pinus
massoniana Lamb.) were used in this study. Moso bamboo
aged 4 years old was taken from a bamboo plantation located in Zhejiang
Province, China. The initial moisture content was about 6.45%. Masson
pine aged 20 years old was taken from Anhui Province, China. The initial
moisture content was about 10%. They were broken down to particles
using a Wiley Mill. Samples were screened to get 250–425 μm
particles, which were dried at temperature 105 °C for 24 h. Bamboo
and masson pine particles were torrefied at a temperature of 300 °C
for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min in a muffle furnace under
a nitrogen atmosphere.36 Raw and torrefied
bamboo or masson pine were, respectively, mixed with mass ratios of
20:80, 40:60, 60:40, and 80:20.

4.2 Determination of Proximate and Ultimate
The determination
of moisture and volatiles was performed according to GB/T 212-2008.
The determination of inorganic ash was performed according to D1102-84.
The determination of the high heating value was performed according
to ASTM E 711. The determination of C, H, and N was performed according
to GB/T 476-2008. The oxygen content was obtained by difference.

4.3 Determination of Combustion
Characteristics
Combustion characteristics of the samples
including HRR, THR, TSP, CO, and CO2 production were determined
using a cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology LTD., UK) with a
heat flux of 50 kW/m2 based on the ISO 5660-1 standard.
The samples were evenly put into a mold with 100 mm (long) ×
100 mm (wide) × 8 mm (thickness). The tests were carried out
at a horizontal orientation. Three replicates of each experiment were
performed.

4.4 Determination
of Ash Characteristics
The ash samples were prepared using
a digitally controlled GSL 1600X tube furnace according to the standard
method of GB/T 28731-2012.(1) The main chemical composition of all the ash samples was determined
by an XRF spectrometer, produced by Shimadzu in Japan. Three replicates
of each experiment were performed.

(2) The surface morphology of ashes was determined by an
XL30 ESEM-FEG Scanning Electron Microscope. TEM measurement was conducted
with a high resolution Tecnai G220, operating at 200 kV and room temperature.

(3) The fusion temperatures
(AFTs) of all the ash samples were carried out according to the standard
method (GB/T 30726-2014) by a YX-HRD testing instrument. Four characteristic
temperatures of ash including DT, ST, HT, and FT were determined based
on the ash cone calorimeters with a video camera and recorded automatically
with the accuracy of 1 °C. The determination of the samples was
conducted under the weak reduction atmosphere.
