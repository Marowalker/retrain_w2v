The
Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid model (TFM) in conjunction
with kinetic theory of granular flows (KTGF) was used for analyzing
water vaporization and the semidry flue gas desulfurization process
in a two-dimensional powder–particle spouted bed (PPSB). In
an environment with high-temperature gas, desulfurization slurry is
wrapped on the surface of moving particles and evaporated, along with
the application of the user defined function (UDF) method to accomplish
water heat and mass transfer by considering evaporation in the simulation
process. The simulation results revealed that the best mass- and heat-transfer
effect of each phase can be found in the outer annulus and the near
spout region, both of which are also the main areas where water vaporization
occurs. The rate of desulfurization products decreases with the increase
in inlet gas temperature as the water vaporization rate increases.
The volume fraction of desulfurization reaction products decreases
with the increase in inlet flue gas temperature. Compared with other
working conditions, the highest desulfurization efficiency reaches
84% when the inlet flue gas temperature is 480 K. The change of the
desulfurization product rate with the radial distance is the same
under different superficial gas velocities, with the peak desulfurization
efficiency appearing in the annulus. The optimal operating parameter
for the desulfurization process is available in PPSB, and the desulfurization
efficiency and gas handling capacity reach the best result when the
superficial gas velocity equals 1.2 Ums.

1 Introduction
It is well known that sulfur dioxide can cause a variety of hazards
to the environment and human health. As far as the environment is
concerned, one of the most destructive effects of sulfur dioxide is
the so-called acid rain. More specifically, more and more fossil fuels
are used to meet increasing energy demand, resulting in the increased
atmospheric emission of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, thus imposing
a great danger to the environment and human health.1−9 The emission of SO2 and CO2 from power plants
burning fossil fuels causes acid rain in the atmosphere, thereby resulting
in serious environmental problems.10−21 Hence, the removal of SO2 and CO2 from gas
has been a worldwide concern. Various technologies for flue gas desulfurization
(FGD) can be classified into three different types, namely, wet scrubber,
semidry processes, and dry processes.3−6 Mohanty et al.3 developed a three-stage countercurrent multistage fluidized-bed
adsorption desulfurization device and carried out an experimental
study on the removal of sulfur dioxide from flue gas based on a two-phase
system under the condition of continuous bubbling fluidization. Zhang
and Gui4 illustrated that high desulfurization
efficiency can be achieved by a magnetic fluidized bed (MFB) as a
reactor and adopting a semidry flue gas desulfurization (FGD) process.
Tao et al.5,6 established a detailed model to simulate
the process characterized by multistage humidified flue gas desulfurization
in an underfeed circulating spouted bed (UCSB). Even more, they also
developed a three-dimensional mathematical model to couple complex
flow and chemical reactions, which can be conducive to system analysis
and desulfurization data analysis. Used in industry, the semidry flue
gas desulfurization process developed during the 1980s. Spray drying
tower, as a typical semidry flue gas desulfurization process, can
remove SO2 from flue gas effectively, thereby serving as
a substitute for wet scrubber.10−14

Several studies on spouted bed flue gas purification, such
as the
removal of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide, have been carried out.
Ma et al.11−13 experimentally investigated the application of limestone
for the removal of SO2 from flue gas in the semidry FGD
process with a powder–particle spouted bed (PPSB), along with
the exploration of the effect exerted by gas components on the removal
of SO2 from flue gas in the semidry FGD process with a
PPSB. However, without building a mathematical model of the desulfurization
process, they analyzed it in a powder–particle spouted bed.
Xu et al.14 experimentally tested a new
semidry desulfurization process in which the powder–particle
spouted bed (PPSB) was used. Wu et al.15 investigated the influence exerted by the pore-size distribution
of lime on the reactivity for the removal of SO2 in the
presence of high-concentration CO2 at high temperatures.
Wang and Zhang16 experimentally analyzed
the effects exerted by humidification water parameters on the desulfurization
removal efficiency of semidry flue gas. Also, a mathematical model
for investigating the removal of SO2 and CO2 in a powder–particle spouted bed under a nonisothermal operating
condition was developed by Rahimi et al.17,18 A laboratory-scale PPSB is employed by Haghnegahdar et al.19 to investigate the effects exerted by operating
parameters on the removal efficiency of CO2. Extensive
numerical simulation of PPSB has been carried out, while only a few
simulations were focused on mathematical modeling in a semidry spouted
bed reactor. Mathematical modeling of a one-dimensional isothermal
model in spouting beds was first proposed by Mathur et al.20 Some mathematical models to analyze the performance
capability of a spouted bed in different processes have been explored.21−24 Recently, Fakhari et al.25 experimentally
analyzed the simultaneous absorption of CO2 and SO2 by a NaOH solution in a PPSB reactor and Niksiar et al.26 established a one-dimensional mathematical model
to predict the behavior of the spouted bed reactor in the gasification
process of pistachio shell pyrolysis carbon. Tseng et al.,27 on studying the interactions between the flow
structure and chemical reaction, numerically simulated a flue gas
desulfurization tower with perforated sieve trays by a Eulerian–Eulerian
method, along with the implementation of the species transport equations
of the chemical reactions in the study.

To our knowledge, no
mathematical modeling has been reported to
investigate the desulfurization process in PPSB. Besides, it is clear
that the operating temperature and superficial velocity of the inlet
gas impose a significant impact on the desulfurization efficiency
of PPSB, making it necessary to analyze the effect mechanism of temperature
and velocity on the desulfurization process. In this study, computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) combined with a two-fluid model (TFM) was used
for simulating water vaporization and a semidry flue gas desulfurization
process in the PPSB on the basis of the gas–solid two-phase
flow. The mathematical and physical models of the water vaporization
process and flue gas desulfurization reaction process have been established
through reasonable hypothesis and simplification of the system, along
with the application of the numerical simulations to analyze the effects
exerted by the operating temperature and superficial velocity on the
desulfurization efficiency in the PPSB.

2 Computational
Method
2.1 Governing Equations
The adsorbent
slurry is continuously fed into the spouted bed, in which the coarse
particles are spouted by the hot gas containing sulfur dioxide. Then,
the desulfurization slurry absorbs sulfur dioxide in the flue gas
with the circulation of the particles and is evaporated by the high-temperature
flue gas. The desulfurization product adheres to the surface of coarse
particles after water is vaporized. Finally, the unused adsorbent
particles and reaction products are entrained by clean gas in the
form of dry powder and collected by a bag filter. In short, this section
summarizes the governing equations and relevant constitutive models
of the two-fluid models applied in the current research.

The
mass conservation equation for the gas phase (q = g) and solid phase
(q = s) is 1  where δṁs represents the mass of the gas produced by the reaction,  denotes
the velocity of phase q, and εq refers to the phase
volume fraction.

The momentum balance of gas and solid phases
is expressed as Gas phase:

The transport equation

Ma et al.11−13 for a cylindrical spouted bed with a conical base,
as shown in Figure 1b, are used to validate the numerical model of water vaporization
and semidry flue gas desulfurization processes in a PPSB. The simulation
deviation of desulfurization efficiency is 0.96%, indicating that
the numerical model of desulfurization in the spouted bed is reasonable.
The bed and grid structures for the computational domain are illustrated

2.2 Water
Evaporation Model
2.2.1 Model of Mass Transfer
In an environment
with high-temperature gas, desulfurization slurry is wrapped on the
surface of moving particles and evaporated, along with the application
of the UDF method to realize water heat and mass transfer by considering
evaporation in the simulation process. Based on the following hypothesis,
a new model describing the water vaporization process is derived from
a model of fuel droplet vaporization.32(a) As shown
in Figure 3, the entire
mass transfer in the water vaporization
process is divided into two layers. Inner layer I is a near-interface
vaporization layer, and its thickness is extremely thin. Outer layer
II is a diffusion layer that occupies most of the mass-transfer film.

(b) The gas temperature of
inner layer
I is uniform and equal to liquid film temperature because it is extremely
thin and the specific heat of water is much greater than the specific
heat of gas.

(c) The mass-transfer
driving force of
near-interface vaporization layer I is determined by the relative
humidity gradient in the mass-transfer film. However, the mass-transfer
driving force of diffusion layer II is dominated by the mass concentration
gradient of the vaporization component.



Figure 3 Simplified
picture of the water evaporation model.

The water evaporation rate of per unit area of desulfurization
slurry is defined as 18  where Dg denotes
the gas diffusion rate, Rd refers to the
particle radius, and ρtotal represents the total
density of the gas phase for the gas–liquid interface (kg/m3). Sh refers to the Sherwood dimensionless
number, defined as 19  where Re represents the Reynolds
number of droplets, Sc denotes the Schmidt dimensionless
number, and BM refers to the difference
between the mass fraction of saturation vapor in the gas–liquid
interface and that of water vapor in the gas phase subject value,
which can be expressed as 20   21   22  The expression
of relative humidity, φ,
in the gas phase is as follows 23  where Psat(MIN(Tw, Tg)) refers to
a vapor-saturated vapor pressure function, whose value is calculated
by the smaller values of liquid and gas temperature. The area of mass
transfer between phases per unit volume is expressed as 24  The liquid film coating degree,
αs, is expressed as 25  where αw refers to the effect
exerted by the volume fraction of the aqueous phase on the mass-transfer
area, expressed as 26  where εw represents
the volume
fraction of the aqueous phase. The product of water vaporization rate, mα, and mass-transfer area, AT, serves as the source term ṁ
of water vaporization mass transfer, defined as 27  

2.2.2 Model
of Heat Transfer
The impact
exerted by the latent heat of vaporization of water is considered.33 The gas-phase energy source term is defined
as 28  The liquid
energy source term is expressed
as 29  Heat transfer occurs among
gas, liquid, and
solid phases in the process of water vaporization. The heat-transfer
model adopted in this paper is proposed by Ranz and Marshal,36,37 with the heat transfer between units of volume between two phases
as follows 30  where the Nusselt number, Nu, is expressed as 31  

2.3 Desulfurization Model
The reaction
of the desulfurization process can be expressed in the following steps:(a) The SO2 in the high-temperature
flue gas diffuses from the gas phase to the gas–liquid interface.

(b) The SO2 diffuses
from the
gas–liquid interface into the liquid phase, beginning to be
dissolved on the liquid membrane surface.

(c) The SO2, dissolving in
the water, generates H2SO3, followed by dissociation.

(d) The S ion in the liquid
film diffuses
to the center of the liquid phase.

(e) The dissolved ionized process of desulfurizer
Ca(OH)2.



The overall reaction
equation is expressed as 32  The definition of desulfurization efficiency
is 33  In addition, assumptions
for the momentum
exchange between phases are listed as follows.(a) The aqueous phase forms a liquid film
that coats the particle surface, so that the drag force between water
and gas phases can be neglected. The drag coefficient between gas–solid
and liquid–solid phases is, respectively, determined by the
Gidaspow model and symmetric model.

(b) The desulfurizer phase and water phase
constitute a wet desulfurization slurry, that is why the drag force
between the desulfurizer and gas phases is also neglected, and the
drag coefficient between the desulfurizer and particle phases and
water phase adopts a symmetric model.

(c) The product phase after desulfurization
is taken out of the bed by gas stream. Therefore, only the drag effect
between the product phase and gas phase and particle phase is considered
and the Wen and Yu model and the symmetric model are, respectively,
used for calculation.



2.4 Simulation
Method
The CFD code Fluent
15 is utilized to simulate the hydrodynamics and desulfurization process
in PPSB. A second-order upwind discretization scheme is applied for
momentum, turbulence kinetic energy, and turbulence dissipation rate
equations, along with the application of the phase-coupled PC-SIMPLE
algorithm for pressure–velocity coupling. Transient simulations
are performed with a constant time step of 1 × 10–5 s. The convergence criteria for the solution are that all variable
residuals, such as velocity, are less than 1 × 10–3, with the geometry, boundary condition, and grids of the two-dimensional
spouted beds shown in Figure 2. A structured grid is used in the calculation domain. A grid
independence test is performed for the two-dimensional computational
model of spouted bed, finding that the grid number of 13 457
is sufficiently fine to ensure a grid-independent solution, as demonstrated
in Figure 1a. Hence,
the total number of grid cells is set as 13 475. Each component
material and physical property parameters of gas are listed in Table 2, with physical property
parameters of other components in Table 3. The model was computed by two Intel Xeon
E5-2699v4 CPU @2.2 GHz and a Nvidia Quadro K620 2GB DDR3 graphics
card.

The boundary conditions for
numerical simulations are listed in Table 4. A comparative investigation
on the velocity of the particle phase between numerical simulation
results and experimental data, as reported by Wu et al., has been
made.34 The maximum deviations of particle
velocity and gas-phase volume fraction in the spouted bed are less
than 26 and 6.9% between numerical simulation and experimental data,
respectively. The deviation is considered to be acceptable, which
can be attributed to the simulation of the PPSB.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Particulate Flow Characteristics
The gas–solid flow pattern, velocity, and composition distribution
were presented before discussion on the effects of the operating condition
in PPSB. Contours of the solid volume fraction in the bed for different
values of the superficial velocity at t = 5 s are
present in Figure 4. As the superficial gas velocity increases, the height of the fountain
gradually increases and the passage of gas in the spout zone becomes
wider, that is, the spout diameter increases.

Figure 4 Contours of the solid
volume fraction in the bed for different
values of the superficial velocity at t = 5 s.

Figure 5 shows the
contours of particle velocity in the bed for different values of the
superficial velocity at t = 5 s. As shown in Figure 5a, in the fountain
area, the particles move downward, thus resulting in the axial velocity
of the particles in this region is negative. However, in the annulus
region, the solid volume fraction is large, and the gas and particles
move in opposite directions, making the axial velocity of the particles
in this region small. Figure 5b shows the radial velocity distribution of particles. The
radial velocity of particles in the fountain zone and the annulus
zone increases with the increase in superficial gas velocity. As the
superficial gas velocity increases, the degree of turbulence of the
gas phase and the particle phase increases, which effectively promotes
the radial mixing between the gas and solid phases.

Figure 5 Contours of particle
velocity in the bed for different values of
the superficial velocity at t = 5 s (unit: m/s).
(a) Contours of particle axial velocity and (b) contours of particle
radial velocity.

Axial distributions of
the particle volume fraction for different
values of the superficial velocity are compared in Figure 6. It can be seen that the particle
volume fraction at nozzle is zero, increases with the height of bed,
and finally decreases sharply to zero. This is because particles move
upward under the drag provided by gas and accumulate continuously
in the beginning. When particles rise to a certain height, the drag
force is less than the gravity and particles start to decelerate upward.
The particle volume fraction reduces until the velocity is zero and
then falls back from both sides to form a fountain zone, at which
the particle volume fraction is minimized.

Figure 6 Axial distributions of
the particle volume fraction at different
values of the superficial velocity are compared.

3.2 Effect of Operating Temperature on Desulfurization
Efficiency
To further verify the reliability of the numerical
model, the comparison in the temperature distribution at each phase
of the PPSB when the gas inlet temperature, as demonstrated in Figure 7, is set as 520 K
is made. As shown in Figure 7a, the temperature at the gas inlet is the highest, followed
by the spout and the surrounding bed, and the lowest in the annulus
and the fountain zone. This reveals that heat transfer occurs among
gas, water, and particle phases when the high-temperature flue gas
enters the spouted bed, with the increase in bed height, thus resulting
in the decrease in gas temperature in the spout region. However, due
to the high gas velocity and short heat transfer time in this region,
the temperature of the gas decreases insignificantly. However, in
the annulus region of the spouted bed, the air flow is large, the
contact time among gas, particles, and water is enough, helping explain
that the heat transfer process is sufficient, and the temperature
of the gas decreases significantly. In addition, the temperature distributions
of water and particle phases in Figure 7b,c are similar to those in the gas phase (Figure 7a), which is because
the momentum and heat transfer between the multiphase in PPSB are
driven by the gas phase. The results show the best mass and heat transfer
effect of each phase in the outer annulus and the near spout region,
both of which are also the main areas where water vaporization occurs.
Also, the simulation results of Figure 7 show that the numerical simulation model adopted in
this paper is reliable.

Figure 7 Temperature of each phase in the PPSB (unit:
K). (a) Temperature
of the gas phase, (b) temperature of water, and (c) temperature of
particles.

In the process of PPSB, the removal
reaction of SO2 is
an exothermic reaction, which is the core link of the flue gas desulfurization
process. Temperature, as a nonnegligible factor, is of important research
value. Excessive temperature will change the solubility of the gas
and absorbent, thus affecting the SO2 removal effect. The
low temperature makes the flue gas difficult to diffuse, incapable
of meeting the standard of flue gas emission. Therefore, it is particularly
important for the industrial desulfurization process to study the
appropriate temperature range of inlet gas so that spouted bed can
not only have higher desulfurization efficiency but also meet the
requirements of flue gas emission. Due to the sensitivity of the operating
temperature to desulfurization efficiency in PPSB, the desulfurization
process and desulfurization efficiency in the spouted bed at different
operating temperatures (T = 480, 500, 520, 540, and
560 K) were analyzed by the CFD method when the superficial gas velocity
was kept constant as U = 1.2 Ums. Figure 8 shows the vaporization
rate in the spouted bed for different temperatures of inlet flue gas,
finding that the main areas of water vaporization are the spout zone
and outer annulus. The rate of water vaporization increases with the
increase in inlet gas temperature. Because the water content of the
slurry is constant, the water of slurry gets more heat from the gas
phase, along with the rise of its temperature when the inlet temperature
increases, accelerating the rate of water vaporization. Therefore,
the rate of water vaporization will increase with the increase in
inlet temperature, especially in the spout zone.

Figure 8 Vaporization rate distribution
inside a spouted bed operated at U = 1.2 Ums, under different inlet gas temperatures
[unit: kg/(m3 s)].

Figure 9 shows the
desulfurization product (CaSO3) rate in the spouted bed
for different values of the temperature of inlet gas. It can be seen
from Figure 9 that
the rate of desulfurization products decreases with the increase in
inlet gas temperature, indicating that, on the one hand, the increase
in temperature of imported flue gas is accompanied by that of the
rate of water vaporization, that is, more water vaporizes. Water is
an important medium in the desulfurization reaction, and the solubility
of the absorbent and sulfur dioxide in water decreases when the amount
of water decreases, thus making the rate of desulfurization reaction
lower. On the other hand, the increase in temperature decreases the
solubility of gas, thereby increasing the driving force of gas-film
mass transfer. Hence, more gas is dissolved at the gas–liquid
interface through the gas film, further increasing the possibility
of contacting with the absorbent and the reaction area, along with
the increase in reaction rate of desulfurization. In consideration
of the two above factors, it can be concluded that the desulfurization
reaction rate decreases with the increase in temperature, that is,
the desulfurization process is mainly affected by the dissolution
process of the absorbent and sulfur dioxide.

Figure 9 Desulfurization product
(CaSO3) rate in the spouted
bed for different values of the temperature of inlet gas [unit: kg/(m3 s)].

Figure 10 further
displays the volume fraction distribution of the desulfurization reaction
product (CaSO3) in the spouted bed for different temperatures
of the inlet flue gas, clearly showing that the volume fraction of
the desulfurization reaction products decreases with the increase
in inlet flue gas temperature. The volume fraction of the desulfurization
reaction products is the largest when the inlet flue gas temperature
is 480 K, which is 2.91 × 10–5. The volume
fraction of desulfurization reaction products is correspondingly related
to the desulfurization rate. The absorption of SO2, an
exothermic reaction, is directly related to temperature. Too high
temperatures will inhibit the absorption of SO2 and decompose
the desulfurization products. Therefore, the increase in temperature
will not be conducive to the reaction in the direction of product
formation.

Figure 10 Volume fraction distribution of the desulfurization reaction
product
(CaSO3) in the spouted bed for different values of the
temperature of inlet gas.

Figure 11 shows
the comparison in desulfurization efficiency in the spouted bed for
different temperatures of inlet flue gas, implying that the highest
desulfurization efficiency, compared with other working conditions,
is 84.23% when the inlet flue gas temperature is 480 K. When the temperature
of inlet flue gas rises, the desulfurization efficiency decreases
with a certain amount of imported slurry and water content, but the
temperature should not be too low. Solid particles are easy to bond
and agglomerate at a low temperature, along with the fouling on the
wet wall caused by the incomplete evaporation of water, which is not
conducive to the emission of flue gas, thus bringing trouble for the
later treatment of flue gas and cleaning of equipment. Also, excessive
temperature cannot achieve the expected desulfurization effect, along
with the corresponding increase in the cost. Therefore, to obtain
a better desulfurization rate in PPSB, the temperature of the inlet
flue gas should be controlled as low as possible above the minimum
limit.

Figure 11 Comparison of desulfurization efficiency in the spouted bed for
different values of the temperature of inlet gas.

3.3 Effect of Superficial Velocity on Desulfurization
Efficiency
The vaporization rate in the bed for different
values of the superficial velocity at t = 5 s when
the operating temperature of inlet gas is kept constant as T = 520 K is compared, as demonstrated in Figure 12. Interestingly, the vaporization
rate of water decreases gradually with the increase in superficial
gas velocity, playing a key role in the desulfurization process. The
residence time of the gas in the spouted bed becomes shorter with
the increase in superficial gas velocity, causing the gas to leave
the bed without sufficient heat transfer with water, and the water
does not reach the temperature required for vaporization, thus decreasing
the vaporization rate of water. The vaporization rate along the radial
direction in the bed for different values of the superficial velocity
at different bed heights is compared in Figure 13, demonstrating that under different superficial
gas velocities the water vaporization rate decreases slowly with the
increase in radial distance of PPSB. To be more specific, when the
bed height is low (z = 0.03 m), the superficial gas
velocity U = 1.0 and 1.1 Ums, along with
the highest water vaporization rate in the spouted bed. This indicates
that the contact time of gas, particle, and liquid water in the spouted
bed is longer when the superficial gas velocity is lower and the bed
height is close to the nozzle, where the gas temperature is high,
which can be conducive to the vaporization process of water in PPSB.
To be more specific, the water vaporization rate increases first and
then decreases with the increase in superficial gas velocity when
the superficial gas velocity is greater than or equals to 1.2 Ums. With the increase in bed height (z = 0.06,
0.09 m), which is far from the gas inlet, and when the gas-phase temperature
is lower, the impact exerted by the superficial gas velocity on the
water vaporization rate in the spouted bed decreases gradually, with
the values of water vaporization rate in five working conditions being
small and not very different from each other.

Figure 12 Comparison of the vaporization
rate in the bed for different values
of the superficial velocity [unit: kg/(m3 s)].

Figure 13 Comparison of the vaporization rate along the radial direction
in the bed for different values of the superficial velocity [unit:
kg/(m3 s)]. (a) z = 0.03 m, (b) z = 0.06 m, and (c) z = 0.09 m.

Figure 14 shows
the comparison of the desulfurization product (CaSO3) rate
along the radial direction in the bed for different values of the
superficial velocity. It can be seen from Figure 14 that the behavior of the desulfurization
product rate along the spouted bed radial position is similar under
different superficial gas velocities, with the appearance of the peak
desulfurization efficiency in the annulus. However, the superficial
gas velocity increases with the increase in turbulence energy among
three phases of gas, liquid, and solid and mass-transfer coefficient,
which is beneficial for the process of desulfurization in PPSB. However,
at the same time, the reaction time is shorter and the absorption
of SO2 is not complete, thus reducing the desulfurization
rate. The residence time of flue gas in the spouted bed serves as
the main factor affecting the flue gas desulfurization process and
takes up a dominant position. A comprehensive analysis of the above
two factors demonstrates that the desulfurization product rate is
negatively correlated with the change of superficial gas velocity.

of the desulfurization product (CaSO3) rate
along the radial direction in the bed for different values of the
superficial velocity [unit: kg/(m3 s)]. (a) z = 0.03 m, (b) z = 0.06 m, and (c) z = 0.09 m.

Figure 15 compares
the volume fraction distribution of the desulfurization reaction product
(CaSO3) in the bed for different values of the superficial
velocity, indicating that the volume fraction of the desulfurization
product decreases with the increase in superficial gas velocity. To
be more specific, the desulfurization reaction rate is the highest
when the superficial gas velocity equals 1.0 Ums. Hence,
the volume fraction of the product is the largest. In addition, the
figure also implies that the volume fraction of the desulfurization
product at the outlet of PPSB decreases with the increase in superficial
gas velocity. More precisely, the larger the gas velocity, the more
severe the friction and collision between particles, and the desulfurization
reaction products fall off from the surface of particles. The larger
the gas velocity, the more the products brought out of the bed, along
with a smaller volume fraction distribution of desulfurization reaction
products at the outlet.

Figure 15 Volume fraction distribution of the desulfurization
reaction product
(CaSO3) in the bed for different values of the superficial
velocity.

Figure 16a compares
the desulfurization efficiency in PPSB for diverse values of superficial
velocity, implying that the desulfurization efficiency of PPSB decreases
gradually with the increase in superficial gas velocity. To be more
specific, the maximum desulfurization rate of PPSB equals 87.05% when
the superficial gas velocity equals 1.0 Ums, but this velocity
is the minimum spouting speed of PPSB. However, the required amount
of treatment may not be reached during the actual industrial operations.
Therefore, the optimal superficial gas velocity should be determined
after considering many factors comprehensively to achieve satisfactory
desulfurization efficiency in PPSB and obtain considerable processing
capacity. The variation of the desulfurization efficiency and gas
flow rate with the superficial gas velocity is presented in Figure 16b, clearly showing
that the smaller the superficial gas velocity, the higher the desulfurization
rate. However, the gas handling capacity declines when the superficial
gas velocity decreases. With the existence of the optimal selection
point for the desulfurization process in PPSB, the desulfurization
rate and the processing capacity are higher when the superficial gas
velocity equals 1.2 Ums and the desulfurization efficiency
and gas handling capacity reach the best result, which can contribute
to the optimum design of PPSB.

and outlet gas flow
rate in PPSB for different values of the superficial velocity (T = 520 K). (a) Desulfurization efficiency vs superficial
velocity and (b) desulfurization efficiency and outlet gas flow rate
vs superficial velocity.

4 Conclusions
(1) The mass
and heat transfer effect
of each phase in the outer annulus and the near spout region is the
highest, both of which are also the main areas where water vaporization
occurs. The increase in inlet gas temperature is followed by that
of the water vaporization rate, while that of desulfurization products
decreases with the increase in inlet gas temperature. Even more, the
volume fraction of desulfurization reaction products decreases with
the increase in inlet flue gas temperature.

(2) Compared with other working conditions,
the highest desulfurization efficiency reaches 84.23% when the inlet
flue gas temperature is 480 K. Besides, the desulfurization efficiency
decreases with a certain amount of imported slurry and water content
when the temperature of inlet flue gas rises.

(3) The increase in superficial gas velocity
is accompanied by a gradual decrease in vaporization rate of water.
When the bed height is low (z = 0.03 m), the superficial
gas velocity U = 1.0 and 1.1 Ums and the
water vaporization rate in the spouted bed is the highest. The change
rule of desulfurization product rate with the radial distance is the
same under different superficial gas velocities, with the appearance
of the peak desulfurization efficiency in the annulus.

(4) The optimal selection point for the
desulfurization process in PPSB is available. The desulfurization
rate and the processing capacity are higher when the superficial gas
velocity equals 1.2 Ums and the desulfurization efficiency
and gas handling capacity reach the best result, which can contribute
to the optimum design of PPSB.
