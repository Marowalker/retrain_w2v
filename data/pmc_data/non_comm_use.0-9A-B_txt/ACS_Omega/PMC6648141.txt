Intramolecular cooperativity in heterogeneous
organocatalysts is
investigated using alkanolamine-functionalized silica acid–base
catalysts for the aldol condensation reaction of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
and acetone. Two series of catalysts, one with and one without silanol-capping,
are synthesized with varied alkyl linker lengths (two to five) connecting
secondary amine and terminal hydroxyl functionalities. The reactivity
of these catalysts is assessed to determine the relative potential
for intermolecular (silane amine–surface silanol) vs intramolecular
(amine–hydroxyl within a single silane) cooperativity, the
impact of inhibitory surface–silane interactions, and the role
of alkyl linker length and flexibility. For the array of catalysts
tested, those with longer linker lengths generally give increased
catalytic activity, although the turnover frequency trends differ
between catalysts with and without surface silanol capping. Catalysts
with alkyl-substituted amines lacking a terminal hydroxyl demonstrate
an adverse effect of chain length, where the larger alkyl substituent
on the amine provides steric hindrance depressing catalytic activity,
while giving additional evidence for improved rates afforded by intramolecular
cooperativity in the alkanolamine materials. The silanol-capped alkanolamine
catalyst with the longest alkyl linker is found to be the most active
alkanolamine catalyst due to its hydrophobized surface, which removes
hypothesized silanol–alkanolamine inhibitory interactions,
with the sufficient length and flexibility of its amine–hydroxyl
linker allowing for favorable conformations for cooperativity. This
study demonstrates the feasibility of and important factors affecting
intramolecular cooperative activity in acid–base heterogeneous
organocatalysis.

Introduction
Carbon–carbon
coupling reactions are essential steps in
many chemical syntheses including pharmaceutical production and fuel
synthesis from biomass.1,2 Many highly selective carbon–carbon
bond formation steps are commonly performed with expensive homogeneous
transition metal–complex catalysts that may suffer from process
and scaling limitations. Inspired by enzymatic catalysis, in which
a precisely shaped substrate binding “pocket” with specific
proximal amino acid functional groups stabilizes a reaction transition-state,
heterogeneous cooperative organocatalysts can be designed for controlled
selectivity and can incorporate multiple proximal functionalities
that would quench homogeneously, like acids and bases.3 This acid–base functionality may catalyze various
reactions, including the C–C bond-forming aldol condensation
reaction that is commonly performed industrially with homogeneous
NaOH as well as others like the Michael addition, Henry reaction,
and Knoevenagel condensation.4−6 Supported on stable porous solids,
these catalysts can be used in flow systems and at moderately high
temperatures, overcoming many disadvantages of homogeneous metal complexes.7,8 Typical supports for these materials are mesoporous silicas, which
provide a weakly acidic solid phase with high surface area that may
be readily augmented with catalytic functional groups such as amines
to form acid–base catalysts.3,8 Silica SBA-15
is commonly used as a support due to its straight mesoscale pores
(∼5–10 nm), which are large enough to minimize confinement
effects and help ensure site isolation for even relatively large (∼1
nm) functional groups.9,10

Such multifunctional acid–base
catalysts have been used
for cooperative and cascade reactions, often with two or three functional
aspects contributing to these capabilities.11−14 In many cases, the support effect
of a weakly acidic silica or alumina is key to the functionality of
the catalyst.15,16 Removal of the Brønsted
acidic silanols of support surfaces by hydrophobic capping with hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS) greatly reduces the activity of base-functionalized silicas
by preventing acid–base cooperativity.17−19 Rational mechanisms
with and without silanol capping have been established for the aldol
condensation of benzaldehydes with acetone catalyzed by nucleophilic
amine and a cooperative weak acid.17,20,21 The polarity of the support also affects the conformations
of functional groups and the degree to which they associate with the
exposed surface.22,23 To achieve bifunctional activity
with an inert support, for one cooperative transformation of a multifunctional
material for cascade catalysis or to ensure proximal positioning of
cooperative species, bifunctional moieties capable of intramolecular
cooperativity are an attractive type of catalytic functionality.

Effective intramolecular acid–base catalysis for the aldol
condensation was demonstrated with homogeneous proline catalysts,
a chiral amino acid containing a secondary amine and a carboxylic
acid.24 Proline-like moieties immobilized
on silica supports achieved similar intramolecular catalytic activity
for this reaction.25 The rigid structure
of proline catalysts prevented protonation of the base by the nearby
carboxylic acid. Co-grafting-separated primary amine and carboxylic
acid silanes suffer from spacing and pairing shortcomings as well
as the potential for acid–base quenching.18 The positioning of a carboxylic acid or other stronger
acid relative to cooperative amines is therefore crucial, but weakly
acidic silanols do not exhibit the same protonation problem regardless
of amine proximity or flexibility.9 Similar
silica materials functionalized by grafted alkyl amine moieties containing
multiple amines with linear or branched connectivity capture CO2 through intramolecular mechanisms within isolated sites.26 Supported organocatalytic sites consisting of
secondary amines with various pendant acids contained within the same
silyl moiety with short alkyl spacing provided evidence of enhanced
base-specific activity with the incorporation of a terminal alcohol,
suggesting an additive benefit provided by an additional proximal
hydroxyl group.27

Fundamental investigation
of supported organocatalytic active sites
requires site isolation on the support surface, which may be achieved
through various synthetic methods and with low functional loadings
depending on the total surface area and the grafted moiety size. Functionalization
by co-condensation of aminosilanes fails to achieve site isolation
even at very low loadings.28 Solvent polarity
and dielectric constant strongly impact the density and site isolation
of grafted silanes.29,30 Nonreactive equilibration of
silanes with the support surface prior to grafting at elevated temperatures
may help reduce silane clustering.9 Syntheses
involving substitutions of silanes with terminal halides or clicks
to azide functionalities reduce silane–silane interactions,
which decrease dispersion during grafting.27,31,32 Site isolation does not always yield the
most effective catalyst, as some intersilane cooperativities at moderate
loadings were most effective for the Henry reaction.33 Still, sufficient availability of cooperative silanols
and minimizing clustering of base sites are important for effective
catalysts.17,19 Although intersilane cooperativity
may increase catalytic activity in some cases, fundamental studies
of isolated bifunctional moieties for catalysis depend on effective
isolation of sites with maximum dispersion and low loading.

This work further investigates the capabilities and contributions
of intramolecular cooperativity with silica-supported alkanolamine
(AA) based catalysts by controlling the amine–hydroxyl linker
length and by isolating the intramolecular catalysis through capping
of surface silanols. Specifically, a series of four catalysts and
a parallel series of HMDS-capped counterparts (Figure 1) with varied linker lengths of 2–5
methylene units were synthesized from the previously described multistep
functionalization method.27 The catalysts
were characterized to describe their structure and define their amine
loadings, followed by catalytic testing in batch aldol condensation
reactions (Scheme 1). The kinetic experiments allow for quantitative comparison of the
materials via initial reaction rates as turnover frequencies (TOFs).

the potential additive benefit of incorporating both intra- and intermolecular
cooperativities in these organocatalysts, whereas the HMDS-capped
catalysts (Figure 1b) have hydrophobic support surface chemistry and comparatively highlight
intramolecular cooperativity and its relative catalytic activity.
The Si–amine linker length has previously been studied experimentally18,34 and with molecular dynamics simulations,23 whereby it was found that three and four-carbon spacings were optimal
for flexibility and preferential conformations to maximize cooperative
activity with the surface silanols. To isolate only one steric factor,
the silicon–amine linker length was fixed at three carbons
for all catalysts. Transition-state conformation and energetics may
impact the specific optimal linker length in promoting intramolecular
interactions. Additionally, catalysts with alkyl instead of alkanol
substituents were tested to study the steric effects of alkyl substituents
separately from the potential for intramolecular cooperativity with
pendant hydroxyl groups. Compared with simpler aminosilane–silanol
cooperative catalysis systems, this report is constructive in suggesting
whether the design of an intramolecular bifunctionality leads to improved
catalytic function. This study attempts to establish intramolecularity
as a feasible mode of cooperativity in bifunctional catalysis and
discusses its potential limitations.

Results and Discussion
Catalyst
Synthesis and Characterization
The textural
properties of the bare SBA-15 support (average pore size = 6.2 nm)
and functionalized silica samples, as determined by nitrogen physisorption,
are listed in Table 1. The functionalized materials demonstrated an expected decrease
in Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume
and average pore size with iodosilane grafting, HMDS-capping, and
alkanolamine substitution, which resulted in relatively bulky (∼1
nm) surface-grafted functional groups. The success of the known HMDS-capping
method from SBA-I to SBA-I-HMDS
was confirmed by a decrease in surface area, thermogravimetric analysis,
and C and H wt % increases from elemental analysis (Supporting Information). Capping by HMDS removes all accessible
silanols on the silica support area while leaving the grafted iodosilane
moieties intact for subsequent substitution. To measure the stability
of the HMDS capping during the post-substitution acid washing step,
a batch of HMDS-capped SBA-15 HMDS was treated with the acid washing
treatment used during the substitution workup. A minor reduction in
mass lost during thermogravimetric analysis was noted in the capped
silica after washing with acid, indicating that some limited removal
of HMDS-capping groups may occur during the substitution step (Figure S3).

The loading of functional groups
was determined by CHNI combustion
elemental analysis performed in triplicate to sufficiently capture
the error and resulting standard deviations inherent to the technique
for low elemental contents (Table 1). A low grafting density of iodosilanes based on literature
metrics for site isolation26 was confirmed
by the iodine content of SBA-I. The functionalization
approach using a bulky halide silane combined with anhydrous dispersion
for 24 h prior to condensation at elevated temperatures has been shown
to result in good dispersion and site isolation (here: ∼0.45
site/nm2) of grafted silanes. Full substitution of iodosilane
moieties was confirmed by the lack of iodine detected by elemental
analysis after amine substitution. The nitrogen content of each catalyst
was used to determine the molar quantity of functional groups present
and was similar to the initial iodosilane loadings. A slight change
in mass-specific loading was observed due to the decrease in total
functionalized sample mass from the substitution of the heavy iodine
with the lighter alkanolamine molecules, partial removal of HMDS caps,
and from error inherent to the elemental analysis measurements.

Kinetic Experiments and Analysis of Catalyst Activity
Secondary
amines with short alkyl substituents (e.g., methyl) are
effective basic sites that may cooperate effectively with surface
silanols for acid–base catalysis of the aldol condensation.
Weakly acidic silanol groups on the silica surface are understood
to act as intermolecular cooperative partners with amines in catalyzing
aldol condensation reactions (Figures 3a and S4a). An increase
in silanol availability has been shown to increase the activity of
amine sites in similar aminosilica catalysts for aldol condensations.19 As such, the addition of a terminal alkyl-linked
hydroxyl group proximal to the amine could potentially be expected
to improve cooperative availability and increase activity. Uncapped
alkanolamine catalysts have the potential for intermolecular (silane
amine–surface silanol) as well as intramolecular (silane amine–silane
hydroxyl) cooperativity, whereas HMDS-capped variants may exhibit
primarily only intramolecular (silane amine–silane hydroxyl)
cooperativity. Although the synthesis method employed here minimizes
silane clustering during surface grafting, some variations around
the resulting average spacing (0.45 site/nm2) of sites
could yield sites in sufficient proximity for intermolecular (silane–silane)
cooperativity. The full length of the silyl alkanolamine moieties
varies from ∼8 to 12 Å, and there may exist conformations
where some intersilane cooperativities occur between partially clustered
silanes (silane amine, to adjacent silane hydroxyl, Figure S5). This possibility may contribute some intermolecular
cooperativities to HMDS-capped catalysts, which otherwise could exhibit
acid–base cooperativity only intramolecularly within a silyl
alkanolamine. The distance between average spaced sites should be
too great for this intersilane cooperativity, however, some minor
contributions to overall activity may be attributed to closer than
average sites within reasonable variation of the average site spacing.
Additionally, partial HMDS removal during substitution would result
in a small number of surface silanols in capped materials. This effect
is minor but may lead to some surface−silane cooperativity
in primarily hydrophobized catalysts.

Reaction kinetics for
the batch aldol condensation reactions of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde with
acetone performed with the capped and uncapped alkanolamine catalyst
series are shown in Figure 2. Catalysts with alkyl linker lengths of three to five showed
nearly identical catalytic activity, whereas the two-carbon linker
catalyst, SBA-AA2C, had significantly lower activity. The relatively
short spacing between the amine and the hydroxyl group on the AA2C
material may reduce flexibility and conformational freedom, similar
to how alkyl primary amine catalysts previously studied have showed
a requisite minimum three-carbon linker to achieve a maximum in catalytic
activity in intermolecular cooperativity with silanols on the surface.34 This structural restriction could lead to low
intramolecular cooperativity, whereas surface silanol cooperativity
as well as minor contributions from adjacent silane–silane
cooperativity and base-only mechanisms maintained some levels of activity.
Compared to the catalysts with longer alkanol substituents, the short
ethyl alcohol substituent could reduce cooperativity with neighboring
silanes. The 3–5C catalysts, however, may have adequate spacing
and flexibility for some intramolecular cooperative functions, leading
to increased rates relative to the small spacer catalyst (Figure 2). However, no significant
improvement of catalytic activity was observed when increasing the
alkyl spacer length beyond three carbons, as the additional alkyl
spacing may not further improve the cooperative benefit of the pendant
hydroxyl group for uncapped catalysts.

Figure 2 Conversion of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde
over time catalyzed by (a) uncapped
and (b) HMDS-capped alkanolamine catalysts. Linear fits for initial
rates used to calculate TOFs are shown.

Key differences were observed between catalysts with and
without
HMDS capping, indicative of the important effects of surface silanols
on reactivity. Reaction data for the HMDS-capped alkanolamine catalyst
series (Figure 2b)
showed a clear dependence on spacer length, noting that this was a
different trend than observed in the uncapped series. Without surface
silanols necessary for intermolecular surface–silane amine
acid–base cooperativity, this series of materials reflects
primarily the effects of the intramolecular interactions between the
terminal hydroxyl group and the amine in the alkanolamine moieties
(Figure 3b). Catalysts with less than five-carbon alkyl linkers
had relatively low rates that were approximately indistinguishable,
in part due to the error inherent to both catalyst loading and performance
measurements. A dramatic jump in catalytic activity was noted for
the capped five-carbon catalyst, SBA-HMDS-AA5C. This longest linker
length catalyst was evidently quite effective for intramolecular cooperative
catalysis and was the most active alkanolamine catalyst studied here.
The hydrophobized surface resulting from HMDS-capping may decrease
the propensity for the relatively long alkanolamine moiety to lay
flat or associate with the pore surface, leaving it readily accessible
to reactive species near the catalyst surface.23,36 In uncapped materials, strong hydrogen bonding interactions between
secondary amines or terminal hydroxyl groups with the polar surface
may poison potential active sites. Hydrophobic interactions of alkyl
linkers with HMDS-capped surfaces may occur but would not occupy catalytic
species as in uncapped materials. The long linker length may afford
the flexibility requisite for the specific conformation(s) of intramolecular
acid–base cooperativity involving the enamine intermediate
and local activation of the aldehyde group of 4-NB (Figure 3b).20,27

conformation for the C–C bond-forming steps of
intermolecular- (a, surface–silane) and intramolecular (b,
silane–silane)-catalyzed aldol condensation reactions of acetone
and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. Full proposed pathways are shown in Figure S3.

Comparison of the TOFs for the uncapped and capped alkanolamine
catalyst series is shown in Figure 4. The HMDS-capped 2C catalyst had a nearly identical
TOF as its uncapped counterpart, indicating that the surface capping
did not significantly decrease activity, and that the measured catalytic
function may be attributed to some minor extents of silane–adjacent
silane cooperativity as well as the known but slower base-only mechanism
observed in HMDS-capped aminosilica materials.19 Details of how the electronics of such substituent may
affect the catalysis was not explored in this study. The 3–4C
HMDS-capped catalysts showed reduced TOFs compared to their uncapped
counterparts, indicative of the benefit of intermolecular cooperativity
with surface silanols when intramolecular cooperativity may not be
significant due to the intermediate linker length and flexibility.
The 5C-capped catalyst demonstrated the greatest alkanolamine catalyst
TOF, a surprising result as HMDS-capping of surface silanols has generally
reduced aminosilane catalytic activity in relevant literature examples.19−21,27,34,37 An alkyl linker length of five carbons is
apparently sufficient for effective intramolecular activity, and the
catalytic function of SBA-AA5C may be relatively inhibited by stronger
noncovalent polar interactions with hydrophilic surface silanols (Figure S4).22,23,38 This longest chain length may additionally increase
the possibility of silane amine–adjacent silane hydroxyl cooperativity.
Although the benefit of intermolecular (surface–silane) cooperativity
is lost by HMDS-capping, the surface hydrophobization appears to highlight
the primarily intramolecular function of an appropriately spaced alkanolamine
moiety.

Figure 4 Turnover frequencies of uncapped and HMDS-capped alkanolamine catalyst
series for the aldol condensation reaction.

For all alkanolamine catalysts studied, TOFs under 1 h–1 were measured (Figure 4), markedly lower than that of catalyst using a simpler
secondary
(methyl) amine moiety (SBA-A1C, Figure 6). Hydrogen bonding or other noncovalent interactions
between the amine and/or terminal hydroxyl and the surface silanols
could reduce the availability of amines able to initiate the proposed
catalytic mechanism (Figure S4). The alkyl
tail of the alkanolamine functional groups may also lead to reduced
conformational freedom and increased steric hindrance, further decreasing
organocatalytic activity.39 Despite the
relatively lower activity of the alkanolamine materials in comparison
to SBA-A1C, insight into the nature of intramolecular cooperativity
may be afforded by analysis of their catalytic function.

The
negative effects of steric hindrance and bulk due to the pendant
alkyl group were investigated with a set of secondary amine catalysts
(SBA-A5C and SBA-HMDS-A5C) with a pentyl substituent lacking a terminal
hydroxyl and as such no potential for intramolecular or intersilane
cooperativity (Figure 5). The inhibiting effect of a large substituent group is demonstrated
by comparing the activity of SBA-A1C with SBA-A5C, which differ only
in the size of the pendant alkyl group. SBA-A1C has a significantly
greater TOF than SBA-A5C (Figure 6), evidence that the potential
benefit of a terminal hydroxyl group is counteracted significantly
by the negative effect of a bulky substituent to the amine.

and naming convention for alkyl-only-substituted
secondary amine-functionalized catalysts (methyl: SBA-A1C, pentyl:

Figure 6 Comparison of TOFs for the best performing alkanolamine catalysts
(AA5C) with alkyl-only-substituted secondary amine catalysts (SBA-A1C,
SBA-A5C, SBA-HMDS-A5C).

Finally, the similar rates observed with SBA-AA5C and SBA-A5C
demonstrate
that both have key limitations in comparison to the best intramolecular
(SBA-HMDS-AA5C) and intermolecular (SBA-A1C) analogs. SBA-AA5C lacks
the hydrophobized HMDS-terminated surface that apparently helps drive
the intramolecular catalytic function of SBA-HMDS-AA5C (Figure 3), and SBA-A5C suffers from
the effects of steric hindrance related to its large pentyl substituent
(Figure 5) compared
to A1C. SBA-A5C also lacks the intramolecular and intersilane cooperative
potentials of SBA-AA5C. The cooperative effect of surface silanols
in acid–base catalysis with aminosilanes has been shown to
reach a maximum when sufficient silanol–amine spacing is achieved.19 A similar effect with the terminal hydroxyl
of an alkanolamine moiety is observed here, wherein SBA-HMDS-AA5C
is the best performing intramolecularly cooperative catalyst studied
here. However, these two types of cooperativity may not be additive,
as seen by the activity of the SBA-AA5C material. Since the number
of basic sites on the catalyst is the limiting factor predetermined
by the silane loading, the surface silanols in a simple aminosilane
catalyst, e.g., SBA-A1C, may already provide adequate availability
of cooperative acid sites. In addition, the long-chain substituents
may lead to inhibitive steric effects (SBA-A5C), and alkanolamine–surface
polar interactions (multipoint H-bonding) may reduce the availability
of active sites (SBA-AA5C).

Comparison to Previous Works
The
catalytic rates observed
in this study were internally consistent and reproducible but contrast
higher rates shown with similar SBA-AA2C materials in a previous work
(Figure 7).27 In initial studies, directly following the procedure
from the referenced work for iodosilane grafting, using a large excess
of silane and noninert headspace gas environments, we consistently
found much higher functional group loadings (0.6–0.7 mmol/g)
in contrast to the low loadings (0.15–0.3 mmol/g) reported
in the cited work. To ensure sufficient catalyst site isolation and
avoid the formation of inactive tertiary amines resulting from a single
amine replacing two terminal iodines, a low functional group loading
was instead achieved by adopting the silane grafting procedure described
by Brunelli et al.18 This method begins
with equilibration under inert conditions, allowing the silane to
spread evenly on the mesopore surface before condensation forming
covalent grafting bonds during the heated grafting step. This results
in an increased grafting yield and was repeated, resulting in consistent
iodosilane loadings.

Conclusions
Intramolecular
cooperativity in heterogeneous organocatalysis was
investigated with alkanolamine bifunctional acid–base catalysts
supported on mesoporous silica. Parallel series of catalysts with
and without HMDS-capping of surface silanols were synthesized with
varied secondary amine–terminal hydroxyl alkyl linker lengths
from two to five in the alkanolamine functionality, tested in batch
aldol condensation reactions of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone, and
compared via their initial reaction rates as TOFs. In uncapped alkanolamine
catalysts, in which inter and intramolecular cooperativities are possible,
alkyl linkers of at least three carbons were shown to be more active
than a short two-carbon spacer. With HMDS-capped materials, in which
silanol–silane cooperativity is removed, a strong dependence
on linker length was found, and the five-carbon alkyl linker catalyst
demonstrated a significantly greater TOF than those of two to four-carbon
linker catalysts.

Contrary to most prior aminosilica catalyst
literature, HMDS-capping
yielded the catalyst with the greatest activity for the aldol condensation
reaction in this work. Uncapped catalysts were hindered by hypothesized
polar interactions between the catalyst moiety and the support surface
as well as sterically by the bulky alkyl chain substituent. The hydrophobized
surface of the capped five-carbon linker catalyst drove active site
availability, and its relatively long and flexible alkyl linker allowed
for favorable conformations for intramolecular cooperativity. Several
alkyl-substituted secondary amine catalysts lacking a terminal hydroxyl
were studied as key control materials. A simple methyl-substituted
aminosilica catalyst had the greatest catalytic activity, but a pentyl-substituted
material showed significantly reduced activity, highlighting the effect
of steric hindrance. The pentyl-substituted materials performed more
poorly than their alkanolamine analogs, indicative of the benefit
of intramolecular cooperativity with a terminal alcohol group.

Although the coexistence of the intramolecular and intermolecular
cooperativities through the addition of terminal hydroxyl groups has
been previously reported to enhance catalytic activity, the present
work explores several complicating factors including polar surface–silane
interactions and steric effects. Sufficient amine–hydroxyl
carbon spacer length is required for effective intramolecular cooperativity,
and surface hydrophobization by HMDS-capping may enhance the reaction
rates of intramolecularly cooperative moieties. An intramolecular
catalytic mechanism is not as effective as the well-studied intermolecular
surface silanol–aminosilane acid–base cooperativity,
but reasonable activity may be achieved in a single silyl alkanolamine
with adequate spacing and a hydrophobic support surface. These results
support the feasibility of intramolecularly cooperative bifunctional
catalytic moieties but underscore important considerations and limitations
to their function.

Synthesis of
Mesoporous Silica Support SBA-15
The mesoporous
silica support, SBA-15, was synthesized according to prior methods
by polymer-directed assembly of silica precursors followed by calcination.27 Two batches were synthesized by the following
method and subsequently combined after initial characterization. First,
24.0 g of Pluronic P123 was dissolved in 636 mL of distilled water
and 120 mL of 12 M hydrochloric acid in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. After
the P123 was fully dissolved, 46.26 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) was added, and the solution was magnetically stirred for 20
h at 40 °C in an oil bath. The magnetic stir bar was then removed,
and the mixture was heated to 100 °C for 24 h without stirring
and loosely covered. The product was then filtered with several liters
of distilled water and dried overnight at 75 °C. The dried product
was calcined with the following procedure: (1) ramp to 200 °C
at 1.2 °C/min, (2) hold at 200 °C for 1 h, (3) ramp to 550
°C at 1.2 °C/min, (4) hold at 550 °C for 12 h, (5)
cool to room temperature. The calcined product was gently ground and
then dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight.

Grafting of
Iodopropyltrimethoxysilane on SBA-15
Silane
grafting methods were adapted from previous works.18,27 Batches (8, 1 g) of SBA-15 were treated identically with the following
procedure and combined after grafting and recollection. Each batch
was dried under vacuum at ∼10 mTorr at 120 °C overnight
prior to grafting. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 25 mL of anhydrous
toluene was added to the dried silica, which was dispersed with stirring
to visual homogeneity. Then, 0.5 mmol of iodopropyltrimethoxysilane
(IPTMS, stored under N2) was added to the mixture, which
was stirred at room temperature for 24 h to allow for even distribution
of IPTMS across the SBA-15 surface area. Next, 20 μL of deionized
water was added to the mixture, which was then stirred at 80 °C
another 24 h, yielding a light pink mixture after reaction. The product
was washed with 100 mL of each of toluene, hexane, and ethanol and
then dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight. The 8 batches were
combined after drying; the combined IPTMS-grafted SBA-15 is referred
to as SBA-I.

HMDS Capping of Surface
Silanols
Roughly, half of the
SBA-I was separated to be capped with hexamethyldisilazane
(HMDS) to remove the remaining surface silanols.35 First, 4.5 g of SBA-I was stirred in 90
mL of anhydrous toluene and purged with argon for 1 h. Then, 55.8
mmol of HMDS was added by syringe to the mixture and stirred for 24
h. The product was washed with 300 mL of toluene, hexane, and ethanol
and dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight. The nomenclature
for HMDS-capped materials in this study is SBA-x-HMDS,
where x refers to the grafted functionality (e.g., I).

Alkanolamine Substitution
A series
of catalysts were
synthesized by substituting the iodine of the grafted IPTMS with alkanolamines
of varying carbon linker lengths (2–5C) between the amine and
alcohol groups.27 Substitution reactions
were performed identically with both SBA-I and SBA-I-HMDS materials. For each substitution, 500 mg of IPTMS-grafted
silica (containing 0.08–0.1 mmol iodosilane) was dispersed
in 8.33 mL of DMSO with 6.67 mmol of the desired alkanolamine. Subsequently,
2 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA) was added, and the mixture was stirred at 110 °C for
48 h, developing a brown color as iodine species was liberated. The
product was filtered with 100 mL of each of DMSO, hexane, and ethanol.
The recovered pale beige solid was stirred with 33.3 mL of 2 M HCl
(aq) at room temperature for 6 h to remove bound DIPEA. The product
was then washed with 100 mL of distilled water and 33.3 mL of 2 M
ammonium hydroxide (28%) and dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight.
The nomenclature for each catalyst is SBA(-HMDS)-AAnC, where n refers to the alkanolamine carbon linker
length (e.g., 2 for ethanolamine), as seen in Figure 1.

Catalyst Characterization
Nitrogen
physisorption experiments
were performed at 77 K on Micromeritics Tristar 2030, and surface
areas were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. CHNI combustion elemental analysis was performed by
Atlantic Microlab, Inc. (Norcross, GA) to identify the iodine and
nitrogen contents, which were used to determine the functional group
loadings and therefore catalyst site density. Duplicates of elemental
analyses were conducted to estimate uncertainty in loadings from error
in EA data due to the low grafting densities.

Catalyst Testing
Catalyst testing was performed with
aldol condensation reactions (Scheme 1) of 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (4-NB) and acetone (excess,
used as a reactant and solvent) with 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (DMB) as
an internal standard. Generally, 3 mL of reactions containing 30 mM
4-NB and DMB and 15 mol % catalyst (based on amine content) was run
at 45 °C for 5 h. The catalyst was dried overnight under vacuum
at 120 °C and then weighed and added to a 25 mL of two-neck round-bottom
flask and magnetically stirred in 1.5 mL of acetone. Two-neck reaction
flasks were fit with a condenser and a rubber septum. Once dispersed,
1.5 mL of a solution containing 60 mM 4-NB and DMB was added to the
mixture via syringe and stirred briefly. Reaction aliquots of 50–100
μL were taken via needle and syringe and filtered through a
wetted 1–2 cm plug of silica before dilution into acetone for
analysis by gas chromatography. The reaction was monitored for 5 h,
with time points taken at every 30 min during the first 2 h and every
hour thereafter, during the latter 3 h. The reaction aliquots were
analyzed by flame ionization detector (FID) using a Shimadzu GC-2010
gas chromatograph. The reactant conversions were evaluated by GC FID
integrations relative to the internal standard, DMB. Experiments with
each catalyst were repeated at least three times. Turnover frequencies
(TOFs) were calculated from regression of approximately linear initial
rates at short times.
