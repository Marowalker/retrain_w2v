Breast
cancer is one of the major diseases that threaten women’s health. Lymph node (LN) metastasis is the most common metastatic
path of breast cancer. Finding a simple, effective, and safe strategy
to eliminate metastatic tumors in LNs is highly desired for clinical
use. Carbon nanoparticles (CNs), as an LN tracer, have been widely
used in the clinical setting. In addition, previous experiments have
confirmed that CNs have good photoacoustic imaging and photothermal
effects. In this study, we used CNs as a photothermal conversion material
and drug carrier, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
as a film-forming material, and docetaxel as a chemotherapy drug to
prepare multifunctional nanoparticles (DOC-CNPs). The prepared DOC-CNPs
present as a black solution, which shows smooth spherical particles
under light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and they have a good ability for liquid–gas phase transition,
good dispersibility, high drug-loading capacity, and low cytotoxicity.
In vitro, they can release drugs and inhibit tumor cells after laser
irradiation. The photoacoustic (PA) signal intensity and the photothermal
conversion efficiency increased with an increase in the concentration
of DOC-CNPs. In vivo, after administration, the DOC-CNPs reached the
LNs. After laser irradiation, the DOC-CNPs absorbed laser energy,
and the temperature of the LNs increased high enough to achieve photothermal
therapy under PA and ultrasound monitoring. Fracture of the DOC-CNPs
was caused by the liquid–gas phase transition with the increased
temperature, and the ruptured DOC-CNPs released docetaxel to achieve
targeted chemotherapy. These findings suggested that DOC-CNPs can
achieve precise treatment for metastatic LNs of breast cancer with
PA and ultrasound visualization.

Introduction
Lymphatic
metastasis is the primary metastatic pathway for many
malignancies,1,2 especially breast cancer. Currently,
the routine treatment mainly consists of resection of the lymph nodes
(LNs) and adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and radiotherapy.3,4 However, during the resection process, some LNs cannot be removed
due to severe adhesion and tissue invasion, and some complications
are caused by surgery, such as upper limb lymphedema, dysfunction,
etc. Traditional transvascular chemotherapy leads to insufficient
uptake of chemotherapy drugs into the lymphatic system, which results
in a poor chemotherapeutic effect.5 Endocrine
therapy with antiestrogen drugs has few side effects, but only hormone
receptor-positive patients are suitable for endocrine therapy.6,7 Radiotherapy is one of the important treatments for malignant tumors;
however, the side effects of radiotherapy are often unbearable for
patients, such as radiation pneumonitis, dermatitis, etc.8 Therefore, a new treatment with higher safety,
reliability, and effectiveness for the metastatic LNs of breast cancer
is still desired.

In recent years, studies have shown that photothermal
therapy (PTT)
has enormous potential in tumor treatment.9,10 Compared
to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, PTT has attracted more
attention in tumor treatment because of its minimal invasion, high
precision, and little damage to normal tissues. Its principle is to
increase the temperature of photothermal conversion materials in tumor
tissues after laser irradiation, and the elevated temperature causes
degeneration and necrosis of the tumor cells.11−13 Therefore,
selecting a photothermal conversion material with good biocompatibility,
good photothermal conversion capability, and good photothermal stability
is the key to improving the therapeutic effect of PTT.

However,
due to the scattering and absorption of light by shallow
tissues, the PTT effect decreases with increasing depth.14,15 Good photothermal conversion materials can effectively increase
the efficiency of photothermal conversion; however, it is difficult
to inhibit all tumor cells by PTT alone. The combination of PTT and
chemotherapy may be a reliable method because sufficient heat can
enhance the permeability of cell membranes, which increases the uptake
of chemotherapy drugs by the tumor cells.16,17 Moreover, to a great extent, the chemotherapeutic effect depends
on the concentration of the chemotherapy drug in the tumor tissue.
Compared to intravenous administration, direct administration via
the lymphatic pathway can greatly increase the concentration of the
chemotherapy drug in the lymphatic system and greatly reduce the concentration
of the chemotherapy drug in the blood. This strategy can maintain
a high concentration of chemotherapy drug in the metastatic LNs, which
is beneficial for inhibiting tumor cells.18 The key factor of combined photochemotherapy is the good light absorption
capacity of the drug carrier. The carrier should also have the characteristics
of strong drug adsorption and a high release rate. In addition, since
photothermal conversion materials have very strong light absorption
in the near-infrared region, they have great potential in photoacoustic
(PA) imaing,19,20 which makes it possible to monitor
the treatment in real time with PA imaging. The related literature
also confirms that PA imaging can be used as a visualization method
for monitoring tumor treatment.21−23

Carbon nanoparticles (CNs),
as a lymphatic tracer, were approved
for clinical use by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA),
and they are a type of activated carbon, which appears as a black
suspension. After the CNs suspension is injected into the tissue near
the primary tumor, the CNs can be quickly delivered into the regional
LNs through lymph vessels. Since the LNs and lymphatic vessels can
be stained black, surgeons can easily distinguish them from the surrounding
tissues.24,25 Therefore, CNs are widely used in sentinel
lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and LN dissection for thyroid cancer, gastric
cancer, breast cancer, etc.,26−28 and they have been confirmed
as a safe and efficient lymphatic tracer. In our previous study, we
found that CNs were also a good photothermal conversion material,
which exhibited a high photothermal conversion efficiency and good
photothermal stability.29 Moreover, nanoparticles
containing CNs and liquid fluorocarbon (CNPs) were successfully prepared,
and it was confirmed that CNPs can provide PA imaging and effective
photothermal therapy for tumor cells in vivo and in vitro.29 However, during the experiment, we found that
the effect of PTT alone was somewhat limited due to the depth of the
LNs, scattering and absorption of light by shallow tissues, etc.

How to improve the treatment effect is the direction of our study.
We found that some studies reported that nanoscale-activated nanocarbon
was used as a chemotherapy drug carrier.30−33 In fact, CNs are also a type
of nanoscale-activated carbon. Due to their very large surface area,
CNs showed very strong adsorption for many chemotherapy drugs, and
the physical and chemical properties of the drugs did not change after
absorption. Hence, CNs are a perfect chemotherapeutic drug carrier. The key factor of combined photochemotherapy is the good light absorption
capacity of the drug carrier, and CNs, with both good photothermal
conversion and a high drug-loading capacity, are the right materials
to fit this need.

Docetaxel (DOC) is a paclitaxel-based chemotherapy
drug, and it
is one of the first-choice drugs for the treatment of breast cancer
in a clinical setting.34,35 However, if DOC is injected intravenously,
then the drug concentration in metastatic LNs is low, and thus, the
chemotherapeutic effect is poor. Therefore, we intend to encapsulate
DOC in CNPs and deliver them into the LNs through the lymphatic system
to increase the concentration of DOC in the LNs. Moreover, systemic
side effects such as allergic reactions, myelosuppression, and impaired
liver and renal function caused by DOC are common via intravenous
injection, but if it is incorporated in CNPs and delivered through
the lymphatic system, it is theoretically possible to reduce the systemic
side effects.

In this study, we used CNs as a photothermal conversion
material
and drug carrier, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
as a film-forming material, and docetaxel as a chemotherapeutic drug
to prepare multifunctional nanoparticles (DOC-CNPs). The novel nanoparticles
were injected around the primary tumor, and they were delivered to
the LNs through the lymphatic vessels. The aggregation of DOC-CNPs
in LNs could enhance PA imaging after laser irradiation. Sufficient
laser irradiation led to an increased temperature of DOC-CNPs, which
caused the liquid–gas phase transition of DOC-CNPs, and then,
the DOC was released after the DOC-CNPs ruptured. The released DOC
and the rising temperature resulted in a combined therapeutic effect.
Based on this study, a new treatment model will be created for metastatic
LNs through PA image monitoring and combined photothermal chemotherapy.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of DOC-CNPs
Figure 1 shows a
new method
of PTT and targeted chemotherapy for metastatic LNs. The metastatic
LN is irradiated after subcutaneous injection of a type of novel nanoparticle
(DOC-CNPs). The prepared DOC-CNPs appear as a black suspension (Figure 2a). It is shown that
the DOC-CNPs exhibited a uniform size and high monodispersity with
a spherical morphology before laser irradiation (Figure 2c1). After laser
irradiation, the volume of parts of DOC-CNPs obviously increased due
to PFH liquid–gas phase transition (Figure 2c2). To learn more about the internal
structure of DOC-CNPs, high-magnification transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were acquired. Figure 2b shows the structure of a single DOC-CNP under TEM.
The TEM images demonstrated that the black granular CNs and PFH were
evenly mixed and distributed in the DOC-CNPs, with white PLGA as the
shell. In addition, DOC-CNPs exhibited a narrow size distribution
with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 463.7 ± 25.2 nm (mean
± standard deviation (SD)) (Figure 2e). This size was far smaller than that of
the ultrasonic microbubbles used for LN detection.36,37 Therefore, DOC-CNPs can be easily and promptly absorbed by the lymphatic
system and quickly transported to LNs after subcutaneous injection.
The average ζ-potential was determined to be −22.6 ±
1.2 mV (mean ± standard deviation) (Figure 2d), indicating the good stability of the
DOC-CNPs. After storage for 1 month, it was found that there was no
significant change in the morphology of DOC-CNPs under a light microscope.
After laser irradiation, the DOC-CNPs also showed a good ability for
liquid–gas phase transition. These results indicated the stability
of DOC-CNPs.

The standard light absorption
curve of CNs was linear with a regression
equation of y = 0.0045 × −0.0226, R2 = 0.9840 (Figure 3a). The encapsulation rate of CNs in the
DOC-CNPs was calculated to be 50.74 ± 2.29% (mean ± standard
deviation), and the drug loading of DOC-CNPs was 2.76 ± 0.15%
(mean ± standard deviation). The standard curve of DOC obtained
from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was linear, with
a regression equation y = 23521 × −20060, R2 = 0.9996 (Figure 3b). The encapsulation of DOC in the DOC-CNPs
was calculated to be 63.85 ± 2.41%, and the drug loading of the
DOC-CNPs was 10.08 ± 0.39%.

carbon nanoparticles (CNs).
(b) Standard light curve of docetaxel (DOC). (c) Cumulative release
rate (CRR) of DOC from DOC-CNPs with or without laser irradiation.

The drug cumulative release rate vs time curve
(Figure 3c) shows that
the cumulative
drug release ratios in the DC + LA group and the DC group were 95
± 3.15 and 40 ± 1.59%, respectively. In the first 12 h,
there was a sudden release of DOC in the DC + LA group; however, the
cumulative release rate became stable from 12 to 72 h. In the DC group,
there was no sudden release of DOC, and the cumulative release rate
gradually and slowly increased. The release of DOC in the DC group
was mainly due to the rupture of a portion of the DOC-CNPs at a temperature
of 37 °C, and the process of rupture and release was slow. However,
the release of DOC in the DC + LA group was mainly due to the rupture
of numerous DOC-CNPs caused by laser irradiation, and the process
of rupture and release was relatively faster. These results indicate
that the laser is a trigger for drug release.

Photoacoustic Imaging and
Photothermal Effect in Vitro
It was shown that PA imaging
was gradually enhanced with increasing
DOC-CNPs concentrations in vitro (Figure 4a1). A higher concentration of
DOC-CNPs contained more CNs, which absorbed more laser energy and
converted it to stronger PA signals. The PA signals originating from
various concentrations of DOC-CNPs were also quantitatively analyzed,
which also confirmed the effect we observed from the images (Figure 4a2).

concentrations in vitro. (a2) Quantitative analysis of
the PA signal intensity of concentrations in (a1) (*P < 0.05). (b1) All concentrations of DOC-CNPs

The error bars represent mean ± SD for n = 3.

All concentrations of DOC-CNPs reached 50 °C
after laser irradiation
(Figure 4b1); however, the curves of the temperature rise were not the same,
and the higher concentrations of DOC-CNPs showed faster speeds (Figure 4b2).

In addition, DOC-CNPs were repeatedly irradiated, and they could
reach 50 °C after each irradiation (Figure 4c), which showed good photothermal stability
of DOC-CNPs. Gold nanomaterials, as extensively studied photothermal
materials, have special surface plasmon resonance;38−40 however, their
near-infrared absorption peaks are closely related to their shapes
and their absorption peaks gradually weaken and disappear under extended
laser irradiation.41 In contrast, DOC-CNPs
showed the ability to rise to the required temperature under repeated
laser irradiation. This stability is beneficial for multiple irradiations
during treatment, which not only enhances the PTT effect but also
reduces the related adverse reactions caused by excessive irradiation.

Cytotoxicity and Compatibility
After human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with CNPs at concentrations
of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/mL, the cell viabilities were determined
to be 90.09, 88.64, 87.08, 86.91, and 86.11%, respectively (Figure 5a). These results
neither showed a definite correlation between CNP concentration and
cell viability, nor did they showed a significant difference with
the control groups (P > 0.05), suggesting that
CNPs
have low cytotoxicity and good compatibility toward HUVECs cells.
It was found that DOC-CNPs without laser irradiation released a little
DOC, as shown in Figure 3c; however, no significant incubated cell death was observed. It
can be inferred that DOC is a concentration-dependent chemotherapy
drug; additionally, the incubated cells are normal breast epithelial
cells, and the effect of chemotherapy drugs on normal breast epithelial
cells is also small, so DOC-CNPs still showed low cytotoxicity and
good compatibility, which is also beneficial to ensure the safety
of DOC-CNPs by subcutaneous injection.

of DOC-CNPs on human breast epithelial
cells (HUVEC) (mean ± standard deviation for different concentrations
of DOC-CNPs). (b) Apoptosis index of different groups after laser
exposure (*P < 0.05).

Tumor Therapy Effect in Vitro
The flow cytometry experiment
showed that the apoptosis rates of tumor cells in the DC + LA group
were significantly greater than those in the CNP + LA, CT, LA, and
DC groups (P < 0.05) (Figure 5b). It can be inferred
that DOC-CNPs can damage tumor cells only after laser irradiation
because of the photothermal effect of the laser irradiation and the
chemotherapeutic effect of the released DOC.

Photoacoustic Imaging and
Photothermal Effect in Vivo
Similar to the experiment in
vitro, it was also shown that the PA
images were gradually enhanced with increasing DOC-CNP concentrations
in vivo (Figure 6a1). The experiment also confirmed that more DOC-CNPs entered
the LNs after injection in higher concentration groups, which led
to stronger PA signals. The PA signals were also quantitatively analyzed
(Figure 6a2), and the results also confirmed the effect we observed from the
images.

of concentrations in (a1) (*P < 0.05).
(b1) All concentrations of DOC-CNPs reached different maximum
temperatures after laser irradiation in vivo. (b2) Different
concentrations of DOC-CNPs reached different maximum temperatures

DOC-CNPs with/without irradiation for three cycles in vivo. The error
bars represent mean ± SD for n = 3.

After laser irradiation, all of the LNs injected with different
concentrations of DOC-CNPs were detected with an infrared thermal
imager, where the image and temperature were collected. This showed
that the temperatures of all groups gradually increased and reached
the maximum within 80 s (Figure 6b2). However, the maximum temperatures were
not the same, and according to the concentration from high to low,
the temperatures were 45.0, 42.8, 39.0, 36.8 °C (Figure 6b1). Many studies
have confirmed that the key to hyperthermia is temperature control,
and 40–45 °C is the proper temperature for killing tumors,
while the normal tissues are not or minimally damaged.42 In this study, the two higher-concentration
groups (15 and 20 mg/mL) quickly obtained the required temperature
after laser irradiation. In addition, if the laser irradiation continued,
the temperature could also be maintained at the maximum, which was
beneficial for continuous exposure and achieving a good therapeutic
effect. To ensure a good therapeutic effect, we selected the highest
concentration for subsequent treatment experiments.

Similar
to that in vitro, an experiment of repeated laser irradiation
in vivo was also performed. The result obtained was similar, and the
maximum temperature reached 45 °C. After repeated irradiation,
the maximum temperature could still be maintained (Figure 6c), which confirmed the stability
and effectiveness after repeated laser irradiation in vivo.

Tumor
Therapy Effect and Side Effect In Vivo
After
4 weeks of treatment, the volumes of LNs in the DC + LA group were
significantly smaller than those in other groups (P < 0.05) and the LNs were significantly reduced after treatment
in the DC + LA group (P < 0.05) (Figure 7a1,a2). The volumes
of LNs in the CNP+LA group were also significantly reduced compared
to those in other groups (except the DC + LA group) after treatment
(P < 0.05), but their reduction was still lower
than that in the DC + LA group (P < 0.05) (Figure 7a1,a2), confirming the phototherapy effect of CNP and the chemotherapeutic
effect of DOC-CNP in vivo. The volumes of LNs in the CT group and
the LA group were significantly increased after treatment (P < 0.05), while the volume of LNs in the DC group was
not significantly changed (P > 0.05) (Figure 7a1,a2). The main reason is that saline and simple laser irradiation
had
no obvious therapeutic effect on metastatic LNs, while when the DOC-CNPs
in the DC group reached the LNs after injection, some DOC-CNPs ruptured
and DOC was released in the LNs due to the temperature in vivo, which
led to a certain inhibition of tumor cells. However, DOC may only
maintain a relatively low concentration in LNs, which was consistent
with the experiment of the cumulative release rate in vitro, and DOC
is a concentration-dependent chemotherapy drug.43 Hence, it was difficult to achieve a better therapeutic
effect. Therefore, a laser was used as a trigger to cause the DOC-CNPs
to rupture in the metastatic LNs, releasing numerous DOC molecules,
and the DOC concentration was increased in a short time. A good chemotherapeutic
effect was caused by a high concentration of DOC combined with PTT
by laser irradiation, and such combination therapy achieved a better
therapeutic effect. In addition, in the pathological evaluation of
the LNs after treatment, we found that most of the tumor cells in
the DC + LA group were apoptotic, and the apoptotic index (AI) was
greater than that in other groups (P < 0.05) (Figure 7b1,b2), which further confirmed its good therapeutic effect on metastatic
LNs. However, after 4 weeks of treatment, although we observed apoptosis
of numerous tumor cells in the LNs, the shrinkage of the LNs is not
expected to be obvious, which may be associated with the longer period
of time that it takes for the necrotic tumor tissue to be absorbed.
Related studies also suggest that the absorption of tumors after thermal
ablation may take 3–12 months or even longer for shrinkage
of 50% or more.44,45 In further studies, we also need
to continue observation for a longer period of time to discover the
duration required for metastatic LN shrinkage. During the treatment,
the skin of the irradiated areas was carefully checked, and no redness
or ulceration was found before and after laser irradiation, which
confirmed the safety of the laser intensity. In addition, no necrosis
or ulcer was found at the injection site of DOC-CNPs, which further
indicated the safety of subcutaneous injection.

and after treatment in different groups (*P <

Shear wave elastography
(SWE) is based on shear wave. Shear wave
is a transverse wave, that is, the direction of particle displacement
in the elastic medium is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
A faster shear wave indicates a higher elasticity value of the medium,
and a slower shear wave indicates a lower elasticity value of the
medium.46,47 Observing the changes in the blood flow
and elastography in tumors before and after treatment is also beneficial
to evaluate the effect of tumor treatment.46−48 In this study,
the images of the blood flow (CDFI, color Doppler flow imaging) and
elastography before and after treatment were recorded. The CDFI images
were semiquantitatively analyzed using the Adler grade, and the elastography
was quantitatively analyzed using the shear wave velocity. After 4
weeks of treatment, it is observed that the blood flow of LNs after
treatment in the DC + LA group was significantly reduced compared
to that before treatment (Figure 8a). After semiquantitative analysis by the Adler grade,
it was found that the blood flow was rich (grades II and III) before
treatment; however, the blood flow was poor after treatment (grades
0 and I). Quantitative analysis was also performed to confirm that
the blood flow of the LNs after treatment in the DC + LA group was
significantly reduced compared to that before treatment (P < 0.05), and it was also significantly reduced compared to other
groups after treatment (P < 0.05) (Table 1). It is shown in the images
that the elasticity of LNs in the DC + LA group was reduced after
treatment (Figure 8b1). It was also confirmed that the value of the shear
wave velocity after treatment in the DC + LA group was significantly
lower than that before treatment (P < 0.05), and
it was also significantly reduced compared to other groups (P < 0.05) (Figure 8b2), which further indicated a decrease in the
elasticity of LNs after treatment. Related studies have shown that
a reduction in hardness after tumor treatment is also evidence of
an effective treatment.46,47

Furthermore, the side effect of CNPs in vivo was examined after
treatment. In general, the side effects of intravenous chemotherapy
peaked around the seventh day after chemotherapy drug injection. Therefore,
the liver function (ALT and AST) and renal function (BUN and Cr) were
tested and routine blood test (WBC, RBC, and Plt) of each group was
conducted on the seventh day after treatment in this study. There
was no significant difference between the treatment group (DC, LA,
CNP + LA, and DC + LA) and the saline group (CT) in the liver and
renal functions and the blood routine test (Table 2), which further confirmed the safety of
CNPs in vivo.

In this study, we did not establish
an LN metastasis model for
breast cancer, mainly because the skin of the rabbit’s breast
area is thin, and the lymphoid adipose tissue is rare, making it inconsistent
with the human breast, which has rich lymphoid adipose tissue. Our
previous experiment had found that subcutaneous injections of DOC-CNPs
in the breast area of rabbits resulted in a small amount of drug reaching
the LNs, and the rate was very slow. In contrast, related studies
have indicated that with the subcutaneous injection of drugs in human
breasts, large amounts of drugs reach the LNs rapidly. Hence, we decided
to implant the tumor in the legs to establish a model of popliteal
LN metastasis and inject through the footpad with thick adipose tissue,
which can easily deliver the DOC-CNPs into LNs through the lymphatic
system.

In this study, we still have some shortcomings that
should be improved
in the future. First, chemotherapy drugs are generally concentration-
and time-dependent. Moreover, PTT depends on the concentration of
the photothermal conversion material in the tumor. Although it was
found that CNs can be retained in LNs for a long period of time in
a previous experiment, they gradually decrease over time.29 Therefore, we can try repeated injections of
DOC-CNPs to achieve a better therapeutic effect. Second, the laser
power and irradiation time need be optimized for a better therapeutic
effect and fewer side effects. Third, the lymphatic system administration
is passive targeting, and tumor-targeting probes can be linked to
DOC-CNPs to achieve active targeting. The question remains whether
dual targeting can further improve the therapeutic effect.

Conclusions
In this study, we synthesized a novel multifunctional nanoagent
with PLGA, CNs, PFH, and DOC as the main materials, which could be
delivered into LNs through a highly targeted lymphatic delivery system
via subcutaneous injection. After sufficient laser irradiation, DOC-CNPs
absorbed light, leading to a liquid–gas phase transition, which
can produce a strong photothermal effect. Combined with the released
DOC, an excellent therapeutic effect on metastatic LNs could be acquired.
Meanwhile, DOC-CNPs showed good safety and biocompatibility, which
provided a new model for the treatment of metastatic LNs.

Materials and
Methods
CNs (50 mg/mL) were purchased from Lummy (China).
PFH was purchased
from Alfa Aesar (U.K.). PLGA (50:50, 12 000 Da MW) was purchased
from Daigang (China). Docetaxel (DOC, 20 mg) was purchased from Hengrui
Medicine (China). Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA 25 000 Da MW) was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) was purchased from Chuandong (China). Isopropyl alcohol
(C3H8O) was purchased from Yangzi (China). The
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was purchased from Dojindo (Japan). Agarose
was purchased from Invitrogen (USA). Annexin V-FITC was purchased
from BioVision. Deionized water was obtained with a Milli-Q Plus system
(Millipore Corporation). Natural saline (NS, 0.9%) was purchased from
Tiansheng (China).

Synthesis of DOC-CNPs
First, 200
μL of CNs (50
mg/mL) was mixed with 100 μL of DOC (40 mg/mL) and stirred with
an ultrasonic probe (Sonics & Materials, Inc.) at 130 W for 1
min. The mixture was placed on a horizontal thermostat oscillator
(NHWY-200F, Aipu, China) for 24 h (37 °C, 120 rpm). Then, 100
μL of PFH was introduced into the mixture and emulsified in
an ice bath with an ultrasonic probe at 130 W for 1 min. After that,
a black emulsion was obtained. Next, 50 mg of PLGA was dissolved in
1 mL of CH2Cl2. After the dissolution was completed,
the previously obtained black emulsion was introduced into the CH2Cl2 mixed with PLGA, and the mixture was emulsified
in an ice bath with an ultrasonic probe at 130 W for 1 min. After
that, 10 mL of 5% w/v PVA was introduced and homogenized (FJ300-SH,
China) in an ice bath for 2 min. Then, an additional 20 mL of 2% w/v
C3H8O was introduced and stirred in an ice bath
with a magnetic stirrer (HJ-1, Ronghua, China) for 2 h. The solution
was centrifuged (Eppendorf AG, Germany) at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4
°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and
the precipitate was washed with deionized water. The process still
took place in an ice bath, and both the centrifugation and washing
processes were repeated three times. Finally, the washed spheres were
diluted in 2.5 mL of degassed deionized water to prepare a stock solution
with a concentration of 20 mg/mL and then stored in a centrifuge tube
at 4 °C for further use.

To prepare similar nanoparticles
without DOC (CNPs), the CNs were not mixed with DOC during the preparation
process.

Characterization of DOC-CNPs
The morphological and
structural characterization and the size of the DOC-CNPs were determined
by TEM (JEM-2100F, Japan). Liquid–gas phase transition was
observed using an optical microscope (Olympus CKX41, Canada). The
size distribution and ζ-potential of DOC-CNPs were measured
by a laser particle size analyzer (Zeta SIZER3000HS, Malvern).

Drug Loading
and Laser-Triggered Drug Release
DOC-CNPs
(1 mL, 20 mg/mL) were mixed with 1 mL of CH2Cl2 and emulsified for 2 h. Then, the concentration of CNs was detected
by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UVS, Shanghai Spectroscopy, China),
while the concentration of DOC was detected by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC, LC-2010A HT, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Signals
were detected at a wavelength of 230 nm. The encapsulation efficiency
(EE) and the loading content (LC) were calculated as follows: EE (%)
= (Ws/Wt)
% and LC = (Ws/Wp) % (Ws: mass of CNs or DOC in
DOC-CNPs, Wt: total mass of CNs or DOC
used in the prepared sample, and Wp: mass of DOC-CNPs).

DOC-CNPs
(5 mL, 20 mg/mL) were irradiated (808 nm, 1.0 W/cm2) for
4 min and then introduced into a dialysis bag. The dialysis bag with
DOC-CNPs was immersed in a sealed bottle containing 100 mL of deionized
water and placed on a horizontal thermostat oscillator (37 °C,
120 rpm). Then, the bag was immersed in a release medium for dialysis
on a horizontal thermostat oscillator (37 °C, 120 r/min). Aliquots
of the liquid contained in the sealed bottle were taken at 0.5, 1,
2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h (1 mL each time, and 1 mL
deionized water was added after the removal of each aliquot), and
the DOC concentrations of the liquid aliquots were determined by HPLC.
The concentration and cumulative release quantity (CRQ) of DOC were
calculated with a standard curve, and the cumulative release rate
of DOC at different times was also calculated. A drug release curve
is plotted between cumulative release ratio and time. DOC-CNPs (5
mL, 20 mg/mL) without laser irradiation were used as the control group.  where CRQ is the
cumulative release quantity; D is the drug concentration
measured in the experiment.

  where CRR is the
cumulative release ratio;
DR is the drug released; TD is the total drug used.

In Vitro Photoacoustic
Imaging and Photothermal Conversion Effect
The PA signals
of four DOC-CNP solution concentrations (5, 10,
15, and 20 mg/mL) in 2% agarose gel phantom were first measured to
investigate the relationship between the concentrations and the PA
signal using the VEVO LASR PA imaging system (VevoLAZR, Visual Sonics,
Inc., Canada). The PA images were collected, and the PA signals were
quantitatively analyzed.

Similarly, the DOC-CNP solutions of
the four concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL) were continuously
irradiated with a laser (808 nm, 2.0 W/cm2) until 50 °C,
and the temperature was monitored every 3 s with an infrared thermal
imager (FOTRIC, USA).

The DOC-CNP solution (20 mg/mL) was introduced
into a 24-well plate
and then irradiated with a laser (808 nm, 2.0 W/cm2). The
temperature of the DOC-CNP solution was monitored by an infrared thermal
imager. When the sample temperature reached 50 °C, the laser
was shut off. While the sample was restored to room temperature, the
laser irradiation was recovered, and the process was repeated three
times. The temperature was recorded every 3 s.

Cell Culture
Human
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231)
and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained
from the laboratory of the Ultrasound Engineering Institute of Chongqing
Medical University and cultured with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal
bovine serum at 37 °C with humidified air containing 5% CO2.

Cytotoxicity and Compatibility of DOC-CNPs
The cytotoxicity
of the DOC-CNPs was evaluated by determining the viability of HUVECs
cells after incubation in media containing DOC-CNPs at concentrations
of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/mL. Control experiments were carried
out using the complete growth culture media without DOC-CNPs. Cell
viability testing was performed through the reduction of the CCK-8
reagent. The cells were first seeded into 96-well plates at a density
of 5 × 103 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C
in 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then, the former medium was replaced
with a new medium containing DOC-CNPs at varying concentrations, and
the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for another
24 h. After that, 150 μL of a new medium and 10 μL of
CCK-8 solution were added into each well to replace the former medium,
followed by incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h.
Finally, the medium was removed and optical absorbance was then measured
at 450 nm on a microplate reader (EL × 800 Universal Microplate
Reader, BioTek Instruments, Inc., USA). The results were expressed
as percentages relative to those obtained in the control experiments.
The differences in the results obtained from DOC-CNPs and the controls
were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance.

In Vitro Tumor
Therapy Effect
The cells were divided
into five groups, including the DOC-CNP solution group (DC, 20 μL,
20 mg/mL DOC-CNPs), the laser irradiation group (LA, laser irradiation),
the CNP solution with the laser irradiation group (CNP + LA, 20 μL,
20 mg/mL CNPs, with laser irradiation), the DOC-CNP solution with
the laser irradiation group (DC + LA, 20 μL, 20 mg/mL DOC-CNPs,
with laser irradiation), and the saline group (CT, 20 μL 0.9%
NS); and the CT group was taken as a control. MDA-MB-231 cells were
seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for
24 h. After incubation, the groups (LA, CNP + LA, and DC + LA) were
given the same laser intensity for 2 min (808 nm, 0.5 W/cm2). After that, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for another 12 h. Then, the cells were collected, washed
with 4 °C PBS, and centrifuged. This procedure was repeated.
The cells were resuspended with 250 μL of binding buffer, and
the concentration of the cells was modulated to 1 × 106 /mL. The mixture of 100 μL of cell suspension, 5 μL
of Annexin V/FITC, and 10 μL of PI solution was added into a
5 mL flow tube, and the cells were incubated in a dark place at room
temperature for 15 min. Then, 400 μL of PBS was added into the
tube, and the apoptosis rate was determined on a flow cytometer (FCM,
FACSVantage SE, USA).

Animal Models
New Zealand white
rabbits (weight range
of 2.5–4.0 kg) were purchased from the Animal Center of Chongqing
Medical University. Tumor-bearing rabbits with a VX2 liver
tumor were obtained from the laboratory of the Ultrasound Engineering
Institute of Chongqing Medical University. The rabbits were anesthetized
by intravenous injection with a 3% pentobarbital solution (1 mL/kg),
and their abdomens were depilated with an 8% Na2S solution.
In the supine position, the rabbits were routinely disinfected. Then,
the VX2 tumors in the liver were excised and soaked in
sterile saline water. Next, the tumor was sheared into small masses
of approximately 1.0 mm3 under sterile conditions. Subsequently,
after similar anesthesia, depilating, and disinfecting, a hole was
created reaching the subskin with a pointed surgical knife in the
left lateral calves of the recipient rabbits. Then, one piece of tumor
tissue was implanted into the hole and the wound was sutured after
hemostasis. Tumor-bearing rabbits were used for experiments when popliteal
fossa LNs (approximately 1 cm in diameter) could be palpated approximately
3 weeks after tumor inoculation.

In Vivo Photoacoustic Imaging
and Photothermal Effect
New Zealand white rabbits with detectable
popliteal fossa LNs were
randomly divided into four groups according to gender and weight (three
in each group), and these rabbits received a percutaneous injection
of the DOC-CNP solution (2 mL, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL) via the footpad
of the hind legs with lidocaine anesthesia. After injection for 24
h, PA imaging of LNs was done in the PA-mode and the PA images were
collected and the PA signals were quantitatively analyzed. Subsequently,
the LNs of the rabbits were irradiated with a laser instrument (808
nm, 2.0 W/cm2) for 90 s and the temperature of the LNs
was monitored using an infrared thermal imager every 3 s.

New
Zealand white rabbits with detectable popliteal fossa LNs received
a percutaneous injection of the DOC-CNP solution (20 mg/mL). After
injection for 24 h, the LNs were irradiated with the laser (808 nm,
2.0 W/cm2). The temperatures of the irradiated area were
monitored with an infrared thermal imager. When the temperature reached
45 °C, the laser was shut off, and while the irradiated area
was restored to room temperature, the laser irradiation was recovered.
This procedure was repeated three times. The temperature was recorded
every 3 s.

In Vivo Tumor Therapy Effect and Side Effect
New Zealand
white rabbits’ detectable popliteal fossa LNs were divided
into five groups in this experiment, including the DOC-CNP solution
group (DC group, 2 mL, 20 mg/mL DOC-CNPs), the laser irradiation group
(LA group, laser irradiation), the CNP solution with the laser irradiation
group (CNP + LA group, 2 mL, 20 mg/mL CNPs, with laser irradiation),
the DOC-CNP solution with the laser irradiation group (DC + LA group,
2 mL, 20 mg/mL DOC-CNPs, with laser irradiation), and the saline group
(CT group, 2 mL 0.9% NS), and the CT group was taken as a control.
The drugs of each group (except the LA group) were subcutaneously
injected in the footpad of the hind legs. The groups (LA, CNP + LA,
and DC + LA groups) were given the same laser intensity (2.0 W/cm2) for 10 min once a day 24 h after injection. The skin temperature
in the irradiated area was monitored by an infrared thermal imager
during irradiation. In addition, the skin of the irradiated areas
was observed to determine whether there was redness or ulceration
before and after laser irradiation.

The metastatic LNs in each
group were examined using an ultrasound instrument in the B-mode (Siemens
Acuson S2000, Germany) with a probe (9L4 line array, 7–12 MHz)
before treatment and 4 weeks after laser irradiation. In the best
ultrasonic section, the long diameter (L) and short
diameter (S) were determined, and the volume of LNs
was calculated using the following formula  The blood flow
distribution in the LNs was
examined using an ultrasound instrument (Siemens Acuson S2000, Germany)
in color Doppler flow imaging mode (CDFI, 2 cm/s, 50% gain) with the
probe (9L4 line array, 7–12 MHz) after 4 weeks of treatment.
The images of CDFI were collected, and the images were classified
into four grades with the Adler semiquantitative method, including
grade 0 (no significant blood flow signal), grade 1 (a little blood
flow signal), grade 2 (more blood flow signal than grade 1, and three
to four blood vessels are observed), and grade 3 (very rich blood
flow signal, and more than four blood vessels are observed).

Elastic imaging of the LNs was determined using an ultrasound (Siemens
Acuson S2000, Germany) with the probe (9L4 line array, 7–12
MHz) 4 weeks after the treatment. In SWE mode, elasticity images could
be obtained after the images were stabilized. The area of interest
(the hardest areas in the lymph node were shown in dark blue) was
selected, and the shear wave velocity values of the areas were measured.
Seven consecutive measurements were performed, and the average values
were calculated after removing the maximum and minimum values. The
elastography values were quantitatively analyzed using the shear wave
velocity.

After 4 weeks of treatment, LNs were removed from
the rabbits.
The LNs were fixed, sectioned, stained with HE, and finally observed
by an optical microscope (Olympus CKX41, Canada). The apoptotic index
(AI) was determined by the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Roche). At 400-times magnification,
cells with a higher nuclear staining intensity than the background
were classified as positive (apoptotic cells). In each section, five
fields of view were randomly selected to count the number of positive
cells.  After 4 weeks of treatment, the blood of rabbits
in the four groups was collected to assess the liver function (ALT
and AST), renal function (BUN and Cr) and routine blood test (WBC,
RBC, and Plt).

Statistical Analysis
One-way analysis
of variance was
carried out to calculate the differences among each group. Data were
presented as the mean ± standard deviation. For statistical analysis,
each experiment was repeated at least three times.
