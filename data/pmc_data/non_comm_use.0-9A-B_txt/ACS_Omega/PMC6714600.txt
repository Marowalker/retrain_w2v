Herein, we describe
the photocatalytic generation of nucleophilic
aroyl radicals from simple aroyl chlorides as a universal and efficient
cross-coupling strategy for the direct aroylation of heteroarenes.
Furthermore, visible light-mediated direct alkylation of heteroarenes
has also been achieved using unactivated bromoalkanes as radical precursors.
These two strategies feature high functional group tolerance, exclusive
regioselectivity for reaction at the more electrophilic position of
heteroarenes, easily accessible substrates, and mild reaction conditions.
Moreover, mechanism studies of two reactions are carried out to support
our hypotheses.

Introduction
Heteroarenes are essential
substructures of a large proportion
of small-molecule drugs, functionalization of which is of paramount
importance for the design and synthesis of pharmaceutical targets1 and natural products.2 Pioneering work by Minisci, known as Minisci reactions, realized
the direct C–H acylation and alkylation of heteroarenes with
aldehydes3f and carboxylic acids,3g respectively (Scheme 1A). With the development of radical chemistry
and photoredox catalysis, Minisci reaction has undergone a remarkable
renaissance in the past decade, offering increasingly powerful methods
for synthesizing heteroarene-based organic building blocks.4,5 Acyl radicals are one of the most important elements;6 they are conventionally generated by aldehydes
to realize Minisci acylation via oxidative cross-dehydrogenative coupling
(CDC) in recent years. However, heating at temperature about 100 °C
in the presence of peroxy compounds becomes a major drawback of this
strategy.4c−4h Recently, Antonchick reported that PhI(OCOCF3)2/TMSN3 can efficiently mediate the oxidative CDC of a
wide range of N-heterocycles with diverse aldehydes at room temperature
(Scheme 1B).4h Our group is interested in photoredox catalysis,7 and we recently employed abundant and inexpensive
aroyl chlorides for the first time as novel acyl radical precursors
in visible-light photocatalysis.7f,7g This method
featured with easy available substrates, mild reaction conditions,
and convenient operation procedure. Moreover, inspired by the properties
of tris(trimethylsilyl)silane (TTMSS)8 and
the work of MacMillan,9 photoredox catalysis
or heat can induce radical initiators to generate silyl radical intermediates,
which are able to abstract halogen atoms from alkyl Csp3-halide bonds to form the strong Si-halogen bond. We expected
that the sulfate radical anion, which is readily generated from single-electron
transfer (SET) between the photocatalyst and persulfate, could also
abstract a hydrogen atom from TTMSS to produce the silyl radical.
We believe this novel approach could be utilized in Minisci alkylation.
Specifically, we herein report two novel methods for Minisci aroylation
and alkylation mediated by photoredox catalysis, where commercial
available aroyl chlorides and bromoalkanes are used as radical precursors,
respectively (Scheme 1C). Simultaneously, reaction mechanisms were studied at full length
to support our hypotheses.

Scheme 1 Minisci Aroylation and Alkylation of Heteroarenes
Results and Discussion
Our studies
of the Minisci aroylation were initiated with the reaction
of isoquinoline 1a and benzoyl chloride 2a (Table 1). The reaction
was irradiated for 48 h with blue light-emitting diode (LED) strips
using Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst (Table 1, entry 4). Surprisingly, the desired product 3a was obtained in 32% yield in MeCN. Screening of the photocatalysts
showed that less reducing systems were not effective (entries 1–3).
Moreover, it was found that the presence of an acid additive, which
was essential in traditional Minisci reaction, decreased the reaction
efficiency (entry 5), although the yield could be recovered by extending
the reaction time to 72 h (entry 6). Furthermore, the excess amount
of benzoyl chloride (up to 10 equiv) had a significant influence on
the reaction outcome, delivering the desired product up to 88% yield
(entries 7 and 8). It was confirmed that both the photocatalyst and
light were required for the reaction by control experiments (entries
9 and 10).

With the reaction conditions
optimized, we next performed a series
of experiments to determine the scope of the substrates. As shown
in Table 2, a variety
of heteroarenes were readily aroylated with a range of aroyl chlorides
in moderate to excellent yields. First, the scope of aryl chlorides
was investigated using isoquinoline as the heteroarene substrate.
To our delight, electron-donating/withdrawing groups substituted in
different sites of aroyl chlorides were well-tolerated. More specifically,
monosubstituted benzoyl chlorides bearing halogen, trifluoromethyl,
methyl, and tert-butyl groups provided the corresponding
products in 42–78% yields under the standard conditions (3b to 3k), and disubstituted benzoyl chlorides
were also well tolerated, delivering the desired products in 57–80%
yields (3l and 3m). The scope of the reaction
was further extended to 2-naphthoyl chloride (3n) and
2-thiophenecarbonyl chloride (3o).

Table 2 Scope of Substrates toward Minisci
Aroylation Reactiona
a Unless
otherwise noted, reaction
conditions are as follows: 1 (0.2 mmol), 2 (2.0 mmol), fac-Ir(ppy)3 (0.004 mmol),
MeCN (anhydrous, 2 mL), 25 W blue LED strips, room temperature, under
the N2 atmosphere, and 72 h. All yields are isolated yields.

Next, the scope of the heteroarenes
was investigated using benzoyl
chloride as the radical source. Monosubstituted quinolines served
as suitable substrates, generating the corresponding acylated products
as single regioisomers at the C1 position in good yields (3p–3r). The reaction using quinoxaline delivered mono- (3s) and diaroylated (3s′) products in 35 and 60%
yields, respectively. Furthermore, C2-substituted quinoxalines could
also be aroylated at the C3 position in good yields (3t and 3u). Other heteroarenes, such as quinazoline (3v), acridine (3w), 4-cyano-pyridine (3x), benzothiazole (3y), and 2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (3z), were monoaroylated smoothly
at the most electrophilic position.

Based on the previous works
of our group7f,7g and mechanism studies, a possible
mechanism for the visible light-mediated
aroylation of heteroarenes was proposed as depicted in Scheme 2. Under irradiation of blue
LEDs, the photocatalyst fac-IrIII(ppy)3 was excited to form the strong reductant *fac-IrIII(ppy)3 (E1/2IV/*III = −1.73
V vs SCE),10 which reduced benzoyl chloride
(Ep/2 = −1.35 V vs SCE)11 via SET to deliver fac-IrIV(ppy)3 and radical anion IV. After
dechloridation, the key aroyl radical V was added to
the heteroarene to provide VI. Upon deprotonation, oxidation
of the fac-IrIV(ppy)3 (E1/2IV/III = +0.77 V vs SCE) through
SET from VII furnished the desired product VIII.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for Minisci Aroylation Reaction
Having completed our studies of Minisci aroylation,
we next turned
our attention to Minisci alkylation as another part of this work.
As mentioned in the introduction, we hypothesized that persulfate
and TTMSS will facilitate the generation of alkyl radicals from bromoalkanes
under photoredox conditions. Our study thus started with isoquinoline,
bromocyclohexane, TTMSS, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and a series
of photocatalysts and oxidants. To our delight, the desired alkylated
product 6a was obtained in 17% yield using Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)PF6 in combination with DTBP as the oxidant
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) under the irradiation of 25 W blue LED
strips. Finally, we promoted the yield to 90% by screening the kind
and the loading of photocatalysts, oxidants, and solvents.12

With the reaction conditions optimized,
we next explored the scope
of this photoinduced Minisci-type C–H alkylation by investigating
the reactions between N-heteroarenes and various
bromoalkanes. First, the scope of bromoalkanes was investigated. As
summarized in Table 3, in addition to the model substrate, four- and five-membered cyclic
systems were also tolerated, albeit with reduced yields (6b and 6c). Both acyclic primary and secondary alkyl halides
reacted efficiently with isoquinoline to generate the corresponding
products (6d to 6k) in moderate to good
yields. Notably, unsaturated bromohydrocarbons containing a phenyl
(6l to 6n) or alkenyl (6o to 6q) group were also shown to be competent substrates. Lastly,
ethyl 5-bromopentanoate, bearing an ester group, was found to react
with isoquinoline readily in a synthetically useful yield (6r, 56%).

Table 3 Scope of Substrates toward Minisci
Alkylation Reactiona
a Unless
otherwise noted, reaction
conditions are as follows: 4 (0.2 mmol), 5 (0.4 mmol), Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6 (0.002 mmol), TFA (0.4 mmol), K2S2O8 (0.4 mmol), TTMSS (0.4 mmol), DMSO (anhydrous, 1 mL), 25
W blue LED strips, room temperature, under the N2 atmosphere,
and 12 h. All yields are isolated yields.

To further demonstrate the functional group tolerance
and applicability
of this method, we examined the scope of this reaction with different
electron-deficient heteroarenes (Table 3). Both quinolines and isoquinolines were well tolerated
(6s to 6w). Quinolines substituted at C4
and C2 positions gave C2 and C4 alkylated products, respectively (6s to 6u). Other heterocycles such as quinoxalines
(6x and 6y), benzothiazole (6z), 2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (6aa), 6-chloroimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine (6ab), and 4-cyanopyridine (6ac) were also proved to be
suitable substrates for this Minisci-type alkylation protocol. For
quinazoline, both mono- and double-alkylated products were obtained
with the monoalkylation product as the major product (6ad and 6ad′).

Mechanism studies were also
carried out. According to the results
of fluorescence quenching experiments, the excited photocatalyst X was quenched by isoquinoline instead of potassium persulfate.
Moreover, giving the results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments
and literature reports, we supposed that isoquinoline and other heteroarenes
might act as both substrates and electron transfer agents.13 Taken together, these observations indicated
an oxidative quenching pathway, wherein direct reduction of persulfate
by heterocyclic compound intermediate XIX was a viable
electron transfer pathway. Radical trapping experiments clearly showed
a radical mechanistic pathway. Quantum yield measurements (Φ
= 9.3) suggested that radical propagation was involved in the reaction.

Based on the literature and our studies, a plausible mechanism
for the visible light-mediated alkylation of heteroarenes was proposed
and illustrated in Scheme 3. Photoexcitation of the Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6 photocatalyst with blue LEDs produced a long-lived
excited state, *Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. The resulting *IrIII species X,
as a reductant (E1/2*III/IV = −0.89 V vs SCE),14 should be able to reduce electron transfer agent XVIII (Ep/2red = −1.08 V vs SCE) to afford the oxidized
iridium species XI and radical intermediate XIX. The SET process between persulfate and XIX delivered
sulfate anion radical XII. In addition, XII could also be formed by the thermolysis of persulfate.16 The generated sulfate radical anion underwent
a hydrogen-atom transfer process with TTMSS to afford silyl radical XIII, which abstracted a bromine atom from the bromoalkane
to afford the key alkyl radical XIV. The alkyl radical XIV was then added to the electron-deficient heteroarene to
provide XV. Upon deprotonation, reduction of XVI (E1/2ox = −0.92 to
−1.12 V vs SCE)15 through a SET
process with XI (E1/2IV/III = +1.69 V vs SCE)14 furnished
the desired product. Alternatively, the persulfate anion could act
as a chain carrier, which oxidized XVI to provide the
alkylated heteroarene XVII.

for Minisci Alkylation Reaction
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed photoredox-catalyzed Minisci alkylation
and aroylation using bromoalkanes and aroyl chlorides as the radical
precursors, respectively. These methods enabled the rapid synthesis
of a series of Minisci-type adducts using commercially available starting
materials under mild reaction conditions with easy operation. We expect
that these new versions of the Minisci reaction will find more applications
in organic synthesis.

a Through
our literature
research, we found that isoquinoline (see refs13b,13c) and its
structural analogue (such as N-aryl imine, see ref (13d)) could be reduced by
reductant (such as Hantzsch dihydropyridine and photocatalysts), the
process from XVIII to XIX should be rational.
In addition, like XVI, intermediate XIX was
also readily to be oxidized by either persulfate or photocatalyst.
“Electron transfer agent” of protonated isoquinoline
was thus defined based on electron accepting nature of XVIII and electron donating nature of XIX. An example of
electron-transfer agent in photoredox catalysis, see ref (13e).

Based on the control experiments,
the reaction
occurred under dark, but with diminished yield. We postulate there
could be an inefficient thermolysis pathway competes with photoredox
reaction.
