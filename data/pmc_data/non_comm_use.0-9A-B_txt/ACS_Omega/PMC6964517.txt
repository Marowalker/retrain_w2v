This paper reports the core–shell structure effects
in calcium
alginate (CaALG) microbeads due to the threshold water level for phase
transition and correlates these properties with respect to pH and
electrical conductivity. Further, in this study, we used a novel microfluidic
device for drug release testing to study the programmed release of
risedronate (RIS-anti-osteoporotic drug) encapsulated in pH-responsive
CaALG–chitosan (CHT) microbeads. Our microfluidic device contains
a single straight microchannel containing a steplike barrier design
used to restrict the mobility of the microbeads at the sample detection
zone. For optical and fluorescence microscopy, single fluorescently
labeled CaALG–CHT microbead containing RIS was placed in the
sample detection zone by flowing through the inlet port with ultrapure
water. The RIS release behavior from the microbeads at different pH
(2.1, 4, 6.8, and 7.4) conditions was determined by using a spectrophotometer
connected to the outlet port of the device. Results of our first study
showed that the decrease in the concentration of CaCl2 increases
the swelling rate in CaALG microbeads. Maximum swelling was achieved
with the lowest molar concentration of CaCl2 used for fabrication
of CaALG microbeads. Further, electrical current–voltage characteristic
shows the nature of ionic mobility with respect to varying levels
of pH indicating electrokinetic forces developed in the CaALG microbeads.
By using a microfluidic device for drug release testing, we demonstrated
that a sustained release delivery system for RIS can be prepared by
coating with pH-sensitive and biodegradable CaALG–CHT. The
CaALG–CHT microbeads used for encapsulating RIS are resistant
to the acidic environment of the stomach. This may improve the therapeutic
effectiveness and reduce the gastric adverse effects associated with
RIS by preventing its decomposition in the acidic condition of stomach.
The newly developed microfluidic device for drug release testing may
find applications in screening novel drugs and delivery systems.

1 Introduction
There has been a noticeable
progress in the recent years on environmentally
sensitive hydrogels.1 With specific alterations
in environmental conditions, smart hydrogels modify their morphology
and porosity.2 Hydrogels made from alginate
(ALG) have several rare properties, which enables their use for entrapment
or delivery of a wide range of therapeutic interventions, cells, or
proteins.3 In recent years, stimuli-responsive
hydrogels that swell or shrink extremely with even minor transitions
in the experimental conditions have received greater attention.4,5 Several reports demonstrated the effect of chemical as well as physical
stimuli on hydrogel.6−8 Due to unique properties, hydrogels have generated
great importance for their application in bio-sensing and drug delivery.9

ALG is produced on a large scale from brown
seaweed and used extensively
in foods, pharmaceuticals, and regenerative medicines.10 ALG can form hydrogel by cross-linking with
divalent cations (e.g., calcium, barium, strontium, and zinc), and
this important characteristic of ALG allows its applications in drug
delivery systems (Scheme 1).11 ALG is used extensively in
the pharmaceutical industry due to its mucoadhesive property.12 ALG contains blocks of (1,4)-linked β-d-mannuronate (M) and α-l-guluronate (G) residues.
ALG with high M content was reported to be immunogenic and potent
in inducing cytokine production as compared with G in some studies.13 Therefore, it is noteworthy to mention here
that strict isolation and purification protocols are required to ensure
minimal concentrations of endotoxins and immunogenic residues.14 On the other hand, chitosan (CHT) is a biocompatible
polysaccharide produced from chitin and used extensively for cell
culture and drug delivery studies.15 CHT
has gained immense attention due to its antimicrobial, wound healing,16 anti-inflammatory,17 antihypertensive,18 and tissue regeneration
properties.19 The stability of hydrogel
formed from ALG can be improved further by cross-linking of ALG with
CHT.11 In recent years, hydrogel formed
from ALG and CHT complex is useful in pharmaceutical applications,
especially in controlled drug delivery systems.20

Scheme 1 Cross-linking Mechanism of NaALG with Calcium Ions
Risedronate (RIS), a third-generation bisphosphonate,
is an antiresorptive
drug preferred mainly for osteoporosis.21 RIS has been shown to increase or maintain bone density and reduce
the fracture.22 Despite the benefits of
RIS in various bone diseases, the oral bioavailability of this drug
molecule is below one percentage because of low absorption due to
ionization and hydrophilic nature of RIS, which inhibits transcellular
transportation through the intestinal epithelium.23,24 Additionally, RIS form complexes divalent cations with food, which
further reduces its oral bioavailability.25 Further, oral administration of RIS is also associated with gastrointestinal
adverse effects.26 Therefore, to improve
the oral bioavailability and to prevent the adverse effects associated
with RIS, it must be taken during a fasting condition while staying
in an upstanding position for 30 min.27,28

Here,
we report pH responsive calcium alginate (CaALG)–CHT
based microbeads containing RIS. These microbeads were designed for
programmed RIS release, i.e., no release in stomach (range pH 1–2.5)29 to prevent gastric degradation of RIS and then
sustained RIS release in the upper gastrointestinal tract (range pH
6.6–7.5),29 where RIS has the higher
absorption rate. The rationale of this study was linked to the aim
of improving RIS therapeutic effectiveness by preventing the decomposition
of RIS in the acidic condition of stomach as well as reducing its
gastric side effects by coating with pH responsive CaALG–CHT-based
microbeads that are resistant to the acidic environment of the stomach.
Experimentally, we observed that presence of water in the hydrogel
is extremely important for swelling as well as for the pH level to
be sensed. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the effect
of this threshold water level in the initial dry hydrogel microbead.
We considered a core–shell structure of sodium alginate (NaALG)
and calcium chloride (CaCl2) in spherical microbeads.

Microfluidic platforms allow researchers to carry out cell-based
assays in small volume.30 Windbergs and
Weitz reported a drug dissolution microfluidic chip for multiparticulate
drug delivery systems, which allows simultaneous analysis of the drug
concentration present in the dissolution medium.31 Here, we report a novel microfluidic device for drug release
testing to study the programmed release of RIS encapsulated in pH
responsive CaALG–CHT microbeads.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the threshold water (wt %) needed to initiate ionic diffusion in the
hydrogel. The threshold water concentration increases with CaCl2, indicating the gel formation equilibrium state being dependent
on the number of Ca2+ ions. CaALG microbeads of various
diameters were prepared by different CaCl2 concentrations
and hypodermic syringes of different diameters (0.32, 0.64, 1.02,
to 1.28 mm). We observed differences in the swelling rate of CaALG
microbeads made by using various concentrations of CaCl2 content as well as different syringes with varying diameter. The
swelling profile of CaALG microbeads prepared with 10–15 M
CaCl2 concentration and a hypodermic syringe with diameter
1.28 mm showed a substantial increase in the swelling rate at pH 8
as compared with the CaALG microbeads prepared with hypodermic syringes
with diameters of 0.32, 0.64, and 1.02 mm, respectively. It is noteworthy
to mention that this swelling rate and disintegration of CaALG microbeads
at higher pH is due to the ionic exchange between Ca2+ linked
to carboxylic groups of the CaALG microbeads and Na+ (present
in the at pH 8 phosphate buffer).11 These
results indicate that by optimizing the CaALG microbead size, concentration
of the Ca2+ ions, it is possible to design a target diffusion
rate of biomolecules across the shell of the bead in a specific range
of pH condition.

Figure 1 (a) Effect of initial core diameter on the threshold water
concentration
in the CaALG microbeads for various CaCl2 concentrations,
(b) electrical conductivity (FV and RV) as a function of bias voltage
during gel formation.

Figure 1b shows
the nonlinear and hysteretic nature of electrical conductivity as
a function of the applied bias voltage. The preweighed dry CaALG microbeads
prepared by using different CaCl2 concentrations and a
hypodermic syringe with diameter 1.28 mm were immersed in different
pH solutions and the change in conductivity was studied at a different
voltage till the microbeads showed different conductivity, indicating
instability in terms of ion transport. In the forward (FV) and reverse
(RV) sweeps of bias voltage, the conductivities show a nearly linear
behavior when Ca2+ ion concentration is small (0.1 M).
Hysteresis loop becomes large as the Ca2+ ion concentration
increases. These results indicate different paths of phase transition
in the process of Ca2+ ions subjected to different electric
potential. The phases are not fully recovered when the Ca2+ ion concentration is large (0.8 M) even after the electric potential
is removed. In this case, the conductivity increases by 1 order of
magnitude after one full cycle, which indicates that the conductive
paths in the network are formed and stabilized under the application
of the electric potential. This understanding can be further applied
to designing electrical stimuli-dependent diffusion (uptake or release)
of biomolecules to and from the CaALG microbeads.

The swelling/shrinking
profile of CaALG microbeads prepared with
different (0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M) CaCl2 concentrations
and a hypodermic syringe with diameter 1.28 mm at various pH (2, 3,
4, 6, 8, and 10) conditions is shown in Figure 2. We exposed the CaALG microbeads to different
pH (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10) conditions abruptly and measured the volumetric
changes. The relative change in the volume (Vn) of the CaALG microbeads relative to its initial volume (V0) over time was measured when the CaALG microbeads
were exposed to various pH conditions on the outside. A comparison
of the graphs in Figure 2a–d clearly indicates effectively a swelling characteristic
when Ca2+ concentration in the shell is high (1.2 M, Figure 2d) for all pH (2,
3, 4, 6, 8, and 10) conditions, whereas the characteristic changes
to volume shrinkage as the Ca2+ concentration reduces on
the shell for pH greater than 3. An increase in the hydrogen bonding
between the polymannuronate chains causes shrinkage of the CaALG microbeads.
This implies that the net differential pressure across the CaALG microbeads
shell (difference between the diffusive force and the cohesive force)
increases in favor of the water molecules moving into the CaALG microbeads
at pH > 3 for 0.1 M CaCl2. In these CaALG microbeads,
diffusion
takes place for approximately the first 200 min due to a sudden pH
imbalance, following which the volume becomes stable, which is the
case for all cases of pH and Ca2+ concentration. As shown
in Figure 2, at a pH
of 6–7, the CaALG microbeads with a concentration slightly
below 0.4 M CaCl2 can result in good stability of the bead
volume.

Figure 2 Percentage change in the volume due to swelling/shrinking for various
pH values of the solvent and syringe diameter, 1.28 mm for (a) 0.1
M, (b) 0.4 M, (c) 0.8 M, and (d) 1.2 M CaCl2 shell in the
presence of electric potential and pH imbalance.

Similar results are shown for smaller CaALG microbeads
prepared
with 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M CaCl2 concentration and a
hypodermic syringe with diameter 0.32 mm at various pH (2, 3, 4, 6,
8, and 10) conditions (Figure 3). The band of swelling and shrinkage has further reduced,
and the volume is more stable for 0.8 M CaCl2 at all pH
of 4–8 (see Figure 3c). However, at higher pH conditions, due to the small size
effect (smaller diameter of the CaALG microbeads), the diffusion rate
appears to be lower than that in the case of larger CaALG microbead
size (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Percentage
change in the volume due to swelling/shrinking for various
pH values of the solvent and syringe diameter of 0.32 mm for (a) 0.1
M, (b) 0.4 M, (c) 0.8 M, and (d) 1.2 M CaCl2 shells.

Electrical conductivity of CaALG microbeads as
a function of the
voltage for pH = 2 is shown in Figure 4a. Here, an increasing molar concentration of CaCl2 indicates increased thickness of the shell layer formed on
the core of CaALG microbeads. The conductivity of CaALG microbeads
prepared from 0.1 M CaCl2 is greater than that of CaALG
microbeads prepared from 0.4 and 0.8 M CaCl2. For the 0.4
and 0.8 M CaCl2 beads, hysteresis loop both during gel
formation as well as during exposure at a pH of 2 is observed. During
gel formation, no hysteresis loop is formed for 0.1 M CaCl2 CaALG microbeads. Conductivity of CaALG microbeads as a function
of the voltage at a pH of 4 and 8 is shown in Figure 4b,c, respectively. Increased molar concentrations
of CaCl2 clearly indicate increase in the thickness of
the shell layer of the bead. It can be seen that the conductivity
due to 0.8 M CaCl2 is greater than the conductivity due
to 0.4 M CaCl2. CaCl2 of 0.8 M concentration
forms a hysteresis loop in both solutions of pH = 4 and 8. But at
a pH of 4, higher the concentration of CaCl2 is, higher
is the conductivity. In contrast, at pH 8, a higher concentration
of CaCl2 showed lower conductivity and the hysteresis loop
was not formed.

Figure 4 Conductivity as a function of the bias voltage at (a)
pH = 2, (b)
pH = 4, and (c) pH = 8.

It is observed that for a concentration below 0.8
M CaCl2 at pH = 8, the rate of change of conductivity over
bias voltage
increases, and at pH of 4, just an opposite trend is observed. Below
the concentration of 0.8 M CaCl2, the shell is thicker
and that is why the conductivity drops. This may be attributed to
the pH activated ion transport between CaALG microbeads and the solution.
Moreover, we did not observe complete disintegration of CaALG microbeads,
which indicates that the cross-linking of the CaALG microbeads was
not changed at lower pH, as observed with high pH. This indicates
that Ca2+ ions were not replaced effectively by H+ ions. When the concentration of H+ ion rises above a
threshold value, the H+ ions emigrate into the CaALG microbeads,
which disturbs the inner electroneutrality of the microbeads. This
consecutively leads to the outward flux of anions from the CaALG microbeads.
The conductivity range widens for pH of 2, and it reduces as the pH
crosses 6. For the extreme condition of pH = 2 and 0.8 M CaCl2 (Figure 4a),
a sharp transition in the phase can be seen with a hysteresis loop
around 2 V. Around these transition states, by altering the voltage,
it is possible to create electrical stimulation to change the electrical
conductivity. A change in the electrical conductivity would produce
ionic diffusion.

Figure 5A,B shows
a schematic representation of fluorescently labeled CaALG–CHT
microbeads and a possible mechanism of polyelectrolyte complex formation
between CHT and ALG microbeads, containing RIS. In this study, we
used a microfluidic device for enabling live optical and fluorescence
imaging of the fluorescently labeled microbeads containing risedronate
at different pH (2.1, 4, 6, and 7.4) conditions (Figure 5C,D). pH-dependent properties
of the CaALG–CHT microbeads containing RIS were studied by
using optical and fluorescence microscopy at different pH conditions
inside the microfluidic device (Figures 5E,F and 6A,B). CaALG–CHT
microbeads containing RIS synthesized at pH 6 were exposed to pH 2.1
and 4; their size decreased from 1152 ± 15.58 to 756.28 ±
14.60 and 762.01 ± 15.72 μm, respectively (Figure 5F). This decrease in CaALG–CHT
microbead size can be explained by the coiling of CHT and ALG chains
at the cross-linking points. The increased size of CaALG–CHT
microbeads at pH of 7.4 indicates that the swelling of the CaALG–CHT
microbeads was enhanced due to ionization of carboxylic acid groups
in ALG, which resulted in Donnan osmotic swelling of the CaALG–CHT
microbeads.

Figure 6A shows
the representative fluorescence images of CaALG–CHT microbeads
containing RIS at pH 2.1 and 7.4. The RIS release was clearly observed
at pH 7.4. We analyzed the mean fluorescence intensity of fluorescein
isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC), rhodamine 6G (RG) observed for CaALG–CHT
microbeads containing RIS at different pH (2.1, 4, 6.8, and 7.4) conditions.
The mean fluorescence intensity of FITC and RG observed at pH 6.8
and 7.4 for CaALG–CHT microbeads containing RIS was significantly
(P < 0.001) lower as compared to that for pH 2.1
(Figure 6B). This may
be attributed to the disintegration of CaALG–CHT microbeads
at pH 6.8 and 7.4 and release of RIS. We coated ALG with CHT to prevent
the burst release of RIS after immediate disintegration of CaALG microbeads
at pH 7.4. As shown in Figure 6C, at lower pH 2.1, the RIS release from CHT–CaALG
microbeads was minimal due to the inability of the acidic buffer medium
to penetrate the CaALG–CHT microbead. In contrast, the initial
pronounced release of the RIS at pH 6.8 and 7.4, followed by sustained
release after 10 h might be due to these factors: (i) initially, Ca2+ ions present in the polymannuronate units of ALG are exchanged
with Na+ ions present in the buffer solution,32 which causes chain relaxation and enhanced swelling
and RIS release; (ii) further, Ca2+ ions bind with the
−COO– group of the polyglucuronate units and thus form
the tight egg-box structure, which also starts to exchange with Na+ ions in the buffer medium because polyglucuronate sequences
have a strong autocooperative binding of Ca2+ ions.

We demonstrated the pH-sensitive diffusion through the CaALG–CHT
based microbeads by considering the problem of releasing an osteoporosis
drug RIS.24 It is noteworthy to mention
that the coating of CaALG–RIS with CHT considerably reduced
RIS release in acidic pH due to shrinkage of the CaALG–CHT
beads. The probable reason is that electrostatic interaction between
the amino group of CHT and carboxyl groups of the ALG generated a
compact surface layer that reduced fluid diffusion and erosion of
the pH-sensitive microbeads. The swelling of the CaALG–CHT
beads increased dramatically at pH 6.8 and 7.4, which resulted in
initial burst release of RIS followed by a sustained release over
an extended period of time up to 24 h. Slow release of drug is an
important factor to be considered in CaALG–CHT based microbeads.
Therapies for osteoporosis and Paget’s disease can benefit
from controlled release of the RIS for extended delivery of this drug
to the duodenum and jejunum parts of the intestine.33 Controlled RIS release should allow an improvement in bioavailability,
thus allowing a lowering of the total dose of RIS. The rationale of
this study was linked to the aim of improving RIS therapeutic effectiveness
by preventing the decomposition of RIS in the acidic condition of
stomach as well as reducing its gastric side effects by coating with
pH responsive CaALG–CHT based microbeads that are resistant
to the acidic environment of the stomach. Finally, we also reported
a newly developed microfluidic device, which is used as a tool to
evaluate the in vitro RIS release pattern from developed pH responsive
CaALG–CHT based microbeads. The microfluidic device described
here may have substantial potential for use in analytical and diagnostic
assays as well as in drug-screening applications. The present study
may be used as a baseline for future investigations in developing
a microfluidic device to study drug diffusion from novel drug delivery
systems.

4 Conclusions
In this study, we reported
the pH-dependent swelling and threshold
water dependence on the core–shell structure of CaALG hydrogel
microbeads. We also demonstrated that a sustained release RIS delivery
system can be formulated by coating of pH-sensitive CaALG-based microbeads,
with CHT. We also reported a newly developed microfluidic device for
drug release testing that could ultimately replace animal models.
This microfluidic device might have a potential role in the overall
drug discovery process to predict drug efficacy and safety.

5 Material and Methods
5.1 Materials
RIS was procured from Fleming
Laboratories (Hyderabad, India). NaALG (viscosity: 4–12 cP), CaCl2, CHT (viscosity: 5–200
mPa s), acetic acid, FITC, and RG were purchased from Sigma (Bengaluru,
India).

5.2 Fabrication of Microbeads
CaALG microbeads
were fabricated by the gelation method, as reported by Segale et al.,11 with modifications. Briefly, NaALG was mixed
in high pure water at a concentration of 3% (w/v). With the help of
a micropipettor, this aqueous solution of NaALG was filled in an insulin
syringe needle with a gauge size 31 and added drop wise to separate
glass beakers containing 0.1, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 M of CaCl2 aqueous solution kept under pH 6 with continuous stirring (500 rpm).
After 20 min, the microbeads were collected, followed by washing with
deionized water and then dried at 35 °C overnight.

5.3 Electrical Conductivity Measurement
Before electrical conductivity analysis, the dried microbeads of
CaALG hydrogel were swollen in deionized water. The electrical conductivity
of the fabricated CaALG hydrogel microbeads was estimated by using
the circuit current for various direct current (DC) bias voltages
applied across the microbead. An electrical circuit with a known resistor
in series with the bead sample was connected to a data acquisition
system, and DC voltage was applied. Bulk resistivity of the CaALG
microbeads was determined by applying the equation reported by Yang
et al.34

5.4 Fabrication of RIS-Encapsulated CaALG–CHT
Microbeads
First, 10 mL of NaALG solution (3% w/v) was added
in deionized water. Secondly, to 10 mL of NaALG solution, 1 mL of
RIS solution (0.1% w/v) was added drop wise with continuous stirring
(1000 rpm). With the help of a micropipettor, NaALG solution containing
RIS was filled in an insulin syringe needle with a gauge size 31 and
added drop wise to separate glass beakers containing gelation medium
kept under pH 6 with continuous stirring (500 rpm). The resulting
microbeads were collected and transferred into a CHT solution (1%
w/v), which was prepared in acetic acid (2%). After 15 min, the microbeads
were collected, followed by washing with highly deionized water and
then dried at 35 °C overnight.

5.5 Fabrication of Fluorescently Labeled RIS-Encapsulated
CaALG–CHT Microbeads
First, 10 mL of NaALG solution
(3% w/v) was added in deionized water. For FITC-loaded NaALG, 3 mg
of FITC was dissolved in 200 μL of dimethylformamide and then
added into the NaALG solution under gentle stirring. These procedures
were protected from light due to sensitivity of FITC to light. Second,
to 10 mL of NaALG solution, 1 mL of RIS solution (0.1% w/v) was added
drop wise with continuous stirring (1000 rpm). With the help of a
micropipettor, NaALG solution containing RIS was filled in an insulin
syringe needle with a gauge size 31 and added drop wise to separate
glass beakers containing gelation medium kept under pH 6 with continuous
stirring (500 rpm). The resulting microbeads were collected and transferred
into a CHT solution (1% w/v). After 15 min, the microbeads were collected,
followed by washing with deionized water. FITC-labeled RIS-loaded
ALG hydrogels were further coated with CHT labeled with RG. These
fluorescence-labeled microbeads were examined by using optical and
fluorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH,
Germany).35

5.6 Microfluidic Device
Figure 7 shows the schematic illustration
of the microfluidic device, which was used as a tool to evaluate the
in vitro RIS release pattern from developed pH responsive CaALG–CHT-based
microbeads. Briefly, our microfluidic device contains single inlet
and outlet ports. The top and bottom layers of the microfluidic device
containing microvalves were fabricated from transparent acrylic plates.
The two middle layers were fabricated by using poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS)-coated glass (22 mm × 60 mm2, thickness, 2
mm) with a single straight microchannel containing a steplike barrier
design used to restrict the mobility of the microbeads at the sample
detection zone (Figure 1C). For fluorescence microscopy, single fluorescently labeled CaALG–CHT-based
microbeads containing RIS were placed in the sample detection zone
by flowing through the inlet port with ultrapure water.

5.7 In Vitro Drug Release
For investigation
of drug release, single CaALG–CHT-based microbeads containing
RIS were placed in a microfluidic device (Figure 1). At different time intervals, the release
of RIS from the microbeads at different pH conditions was determined
by using a StellarNet EPP2000 concave grating UV–vis spectrophotometer
at 262 nm.36 This process was carried out
in triplicate at ambient temperature.

5.8 Statistical Analysis
Data is presented
as mean ± SEM. Unpaired Student’s t tests
were carried out using GraphPad PRISM 8 software, (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA). The significance is indicated using asterisks; P < 0.001(***).
