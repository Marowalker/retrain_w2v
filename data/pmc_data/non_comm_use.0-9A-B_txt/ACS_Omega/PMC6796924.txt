An acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1/SOAT-1)
inhibitor, K-604 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease and glioblastoma; however, it exhibits
poor solubility in neutral water and low permeability across the blood–brain
barrier. In this study, we report the successful delivery of K-604
to the brain via the intranasal route in mice using a hydroxycarboxylic
acid solution. In cerebral tissue, the AUC of K-604 after intranasal
administration (10 μL; 108 μg of K-604/mouse) was 772
ng·min/g, whereas that after oral administration (166 μg
of K-604/mouse) was 8.9 ng·min/g. Thus, the index of brain-targeting
efficiency was 133-fold based on the dose conversion. Even with intranasal
administration of K-604 once per day for 7 days, the level of cholesteryl
esters markedly decreased from 0.70 to 0.04 μmol/g in the mouse
brain. Thus, this application will be a crucial therapeutic solution
for ACAT-1 overexpressing diseases in the brain.

==== Body
Introduction
Acyl-coenzyme A (CoA):cholesterol O-acyltransferase
(ACAT), also known as sterol O-acyltransferase (SOAT),
catalyzes the acylation of free cholesterol with long-chain fatty
acids to form cholesteryl esters (CEs).1 Two ACATs have been identified: ACAT-1 and ACAT-2.2−6 ACAT-1 is the main isoenzyme in the brain, and in multiple neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), inhibition of
ACAT-1 provides several benefits, such as the clearance of amyloid
beta (Αβ) peptides and suppression of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OHC)-induced neuronal cell death.7−12 Recent studies also reported that blocking cholesterol esterification
via ACAT-1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to treat
glioblastoma (GBM).13,14 This evidence has shed light
on the previous use of ACAT inhibitors for the treatment of brain
disease. However, ACAT inhibitors have poor blood–brain barrier
(BBB) permeability because they were developed with the goal of treating
peripheral arterial disease. Therefore, these fascinating trends prompted
us to apply our developed ACAT-1 inhibitor to brain disease. 2-(4-(2-((1H-Benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)thio)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N-(6-methyl-2,4-bis(methylthio)pyridin-3-yl)acetamide hydrochloride,
(K-604),15−19 shown in Figure 1, is the first potent and selective inhibitor of ACAT-1.

Figure 1 Chemical structure
and properties of K-604.

The chemical structure
of K-604 was designed by a solubility-driven
structural optimization strategy;20,21 four nitrogen
atoms allow the molecule to dissolve in an acidic medium and to reach
an aqueous solubility of 19 mg/mL in the first fluid [pH 1.2] used
for the dissolution test. However, the solubility is only 0.05 mg/mL
at pH 6.8. Therefore, K-604 requires an acidic pH, which allows for
good oral absorption because of its high solubility in stomach fluid.17 It remains uncertain whether K-604 can transport
across the BBB, which often obstructs the development of brain-targeted
therapeutic agents that are orally administered. The poor transport
of therapeutic agents across the BBB requires a large systemically
administered dose to reach the required pharmacological concentration
in the brain. Moreover, nontargeted tissues other than the central
nervous system are commonly exposed to these drugs, which may cause
adverse effects. In this study, we explored the scope and limitations
of methods to deliver K-604 to the brain across the BBB while bypassing
the BBB. The intranasal delivery route from the nose to the brain
along the olfactory and trigeminal pathways has been indicated as
a promising approach.22−24 Although numerous studies on nasal administration
have been reported, their major purpose focused on the immediate pharmacological
effect followed by the reduction in systemic exposure and accompanying
side effects and improved bioavailability.25−27 The representative
examples are antifungal agents and bronchitis drugs. Furthermore,
the efficacy of drug delivery to the brain and the mechanism underlying
the conflicting results produced even with use of the same substance,
as is the case for dopamine, have not been described.28−32 Therefore, to confirm the feasibility and practice of intranasal
administration, the present study focused on the following six proposed
objectives: (1) to clarify the scope and limitation of oral K-604
administration by simulating the BBB penetration ratio and evaluating
BBB permeability; (2) to confirm the validity of our protocol by intranasal
delivery routes from the nose to the brain after administration of
a fluorescein sodium salt (uranine) solution and to observe the stained
tissue areas after 2 h of staining; (3) to determine the appropriate
vehicle to increase the solubility of K-604 in the hydroxycarboxylic
acid aqueous solution; (4) to monitor the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles
of K-604 in tissues, including the olfactory bulb and cerebrum, with
different plasma-dependent vehicles and nasal volumes; (5) to evaluate
the pharmacological efficacy of K-604 as an ACAT-1 inhibitor in the
brain after intranasal administration in a single daily dose for 7
days; and (6) to investigate the impact of intranasal administration
of acid solutions on olfactory tissue by histologically evaluating
the respiratory system and olfactory epithelium.

Material and Methods
Materials
K-604 was developed for the treatment of
acute coronary syndrome in this Phase II study by Kowa Company Ltd.
(Tokyo, Japan) according to a previously reported method.17 For use as an internal standard for the low-level
quantification of K-604 in plasma and brain tissues, a highly deuterium-labeled
compound, 2-(4-(2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl-4,5,6,7-d4)thio)ethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-N-(6-methyl-2,4-bis(methylthio)pyridin-3-yl)acetamide was also prepared
by Kowa Company Ltd. Hyaluronic acid (HA), citric acid (CA), and d-gluconic acid (GA) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry
Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Sodium 2-(6-oxido-3-oxo-3,10-dihydroanthracen-9-yl)benzoate
(uranine) and 5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (carbamazepine) were purchased from
FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemicals Corporation (Osaka, Japan). Water was
purified by a Milli-Q Gradient system (Millipore, Milford, MA, USA).
The BBB Kit (RBT-24) was purchased from PharmaCo-Cell Company, Ltd.
(Nagasaki, Japan). All other solvents and chemicals were of HPLC or
analytical grade.

Methods
Simulation of the BBB Penetration
Ratio of K-604
The
BBB penetration ratio of K-604 was simulated by StarDrop and ADMET
Predictor software.33−35

In Vitro Evaluation of the BBB Permeability
of the Drug
The BBB Kit (RBT-24) is a new in vitro model
of the BBB composed
of primary cultures of rat (Wistar) brain capillary endothelial cells,
brain pericytes, and astrocytes,36−41 and the BBB permeability coefficient was measured using the BBB
Kit. The BBB Kit was stored at −80 °C and defrosted 4
days prior to the experiment using the following procedure: (1) 1000
and 200 μL of medium (10% PDS/DMEM F-12 warmed at 37 °C)
was added to the brain and blood sides, respectively, as a thawing
solution; (2) the BBB Kit was incubated for 2 to 3 h in a carbon dioxide
incubator; (3) after the incubation, the medium was removed and 1200
and 300 μL of medium were added to the brain and blood sides;
(4) 1 day later, the medium was removed and the same volume of medium
was added; (5) the transendothelial electrical resistance of the BBB
Kit was measured and confirmed to be more than 150 Ω ×
cm2; (6) the experiment was conducted within 4 to 7 days.

A solution of Dulbecco’s PBS-HEPES (DPBS-H, 100 mL) was
prepared by combining 10× Dulbecco’s PBS (Ca+/Mg+) (10 mL), 1 M HEPES (pH 7.0–7.6) (1 mL), d-glucose (0.45 g), and distilled water (89 mL). A solution
of DPBS-H with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared by dissolving
a solution of 0.1% BSA (34.9 μL) in the DPBS-H solution (34.9
mL) using ultrasonic vibration and used as an assay-buffered solution.
Carbamazepine and K-604 were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with the
assay-buffered solution to make the test solution (1 μM). The
drug test solution (1 μM) was added to the upper (luminal, blood-side)
insert of a 24 well Millipore plate. After 30 min, the solution in
the lower compartment (900 μL) was removed. The sample was centrifuged
at 16000 × g for 5 min to obtain the supernatant.
The prepared sample solution was centrifuged at 12000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant, which
was then added to the tube (20 μL) and stirred. The internal
standard solution (K-604-d4, 100 ng/mL,
5 μL) and CH3CN (50 μL) were added to each
tube. The resulting solution was stirred and then centrifuged at 12000
× g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant.
The supernatant (50 μL) was collected and added to the measurement
vial. Each resultant solution (2 μL) was injected into a liquid
chromatography (LC: ACQUITY UPLC I-Class, Waters, Milford, MA, USA)–tandem
mass spectrometry (MS, Xevo TQ-S, Waters) instrument for measurement.

Solubility Studies
To address the issue of low aqueous
solubility, we examined the solubility of K-604 in various solutions,
such as aqueous solutions of 0.05 N HCl, 0.01 N HCl, HA, GA, and CA.
A known amount of K-604 was added to measured quantities of various
solutions. Minimum amounts of various solutions required to solubilize
K-604 were visually determined within 24 h. The end point of the solubility
study was the formation of a clear solution.

Animal Study Design
In vivo drug absorption and brain
uptake studies were performed as follows. Crl:CDI (Institute of Cancer
Research; ICR) female mice (8 weeks old; body weight 25 to 29 g) were
used for the in vivo studies. The mice (7 weeks) were obtained from
Charles River Japan, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). All procedures performed
on animals in this study were in accordance with established guidelines
and regulations and reviewed and approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments, Kowa Company Ltd. The mice (n = 4 to 5 in each group) were housed in cages and had free
access to standard chow pellets (CE2, CLEA Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan)
and water under uniform housing and environmentally controlled conditions.

PK Studies on Oral Administration
Thirty female ICR
mice (average body weight 27.7 g) were orally administered a 0.01
N HCl solution of K-604 (6 mg K-604/10 mL HCl solution)/kg. Plasma
samples (0.5 mL blood/collection) were collected with heparin at 5,
15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min after administration. After quick extraction
of the brain, the extracted brain was separated into the cerebrum,
cerebellum, and olfactory and homogenized with physiological saline.

PK Studies on Intranasal Administration
Before intranasal
administration,42 all mice were anesthetized
by isoflurane inhalation for 1 min. The K-604 formulation was administered
into each nostril via a polyethylene tube (ep. Dualfilter T.I.P.S.
SealMax 2–100 μL) attached to a micropipette (Eppendorf).
The process was performed gently, allowing the mice to inhale all
of the loaded formulation with normal respiration. We established
four categories representing the study objectives: purposes A, B,
C, and D. Purpose A was to explore the efficacy of drug delivery from
the nose to the brain with intranasal administration using uranine
and K-604 in a 0.01 N HCl solution. Purpose B was to choose a dose
of either 50 or 10 μL of a 0.01 N HCl solution of K-604 administered
once per day for 7 days. Purpose C was to measure the drug concentrations
of three formulations, HA, GA, and CA solutions, after one administration
(10 μL). Purpose D was to measure cholesterol levels in the
brain after intranasal administration of the HA, GA, or CA solution
once per day (10 μL) for 7 days. To address purpose A, 8 groups
of mice were established, all of which received a single dose (50
μL): group A1 (200 mg/mL uranine, 120 min), group A2 (0.01 N
HCl solution as a control, 120 min), and group A3 to group A8 (3.24
mg/mL K-604 in 0.01 N HCl solution, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 min). To
address purpose B, 17 groups of mice were established, all of which
were administered a single daily dose for 7 days: groups B1 and B11
(0.01 N HCl solution as controls, 50 μL and 10 μL, respectively),
group B2 to group B10 (5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, 360 min, 24 h,
0.01 N HCl solution of K-604 (3.24 mg/mL), 50 μL), and group
B12 to group B17 (5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 min, 0.01 N HCl solution
of K-604 (3.24 mg/mL), 10 μL). To address purpose C, 13 groups
of mice were established, all of which were administered a single
dose (10 μL): groups C1 to C4 (5, 15, 30, 120 min, HA solution
formulation); groups C5 to C8 (5, 15, 30, 120 min, GA solution formulation),
groups C9 to C12 (5, 15, 30, 120 min, CA solution formulation), and
groups C13 (nontreatment as a control). To address purpose D, 4 groups
of mice were administered one dose per day for 7 days: groups D1 (nontreatment
as a control), D2 (HA solution formulation of K-604, 10 μL),
D3 (GA solution formulation of K-604, 10 μL), and D4 (CA solution
formulation of K-604, 10 μL).

In Vivo Monitoring of Stained
Tissue along the Intranasal Route
An aqueous solution of
uranine (200 mg/mL) in water was prepared.
This uranine solution (50 μL) or a 0.01 N HCl solution (50 μL)
was intranasally administered to 2 groups of mice (female, 8 weeks
old, n = 5). After 2 h, all mice were anesthetized
by isoflurane inhalation and then euthanized by cervical dislocation.
The brain was quickly harvested, separated into the cerebrum, cerebellum,
and olfactory bulb tissue, and rinsed with physiological saline.

In Vivo PK Study
The plasma blood, olfactory bulb,
and brain samples were prepared as follows. After administration of
the treatments, all mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation
and then euthanized by cervical dislocation. Approximately 0.5 mL
of mouse blood was collected from the postcaval vein using a heparinized
syringe at different time points. The blood was centrifuged at 9100
× g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain plasma.
After quick extraction of the brain, the brain was separated into
the olfactory bulb, cerebrum, and cerebellum and homogenized with
physiological saline. Plasma, tissues, and homogenate were stored
frozen at −30 °C until use. The concentrations of K-604
in the plasma, brain, cerebrum, cerebellum, and olfactory tissue samples
were determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) after deproteinization with CH3CN.

Quantitative Analysis of K-604
The LC–MS/MS
system comprised a 3133 HTS autosampler Z (Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan),
an Agilent 1100/1200 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA), and an API 4000 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham,
MA, USA). Chromatographic separation of the analytes was achieved
on a Kinetex C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 2.6 μm, Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA, USA) using 10 mmol/L ammonium formate (pH 5) (mobile
phase A) and CH3CN (mobile phase B) in system B. The mobile
phase was delivered at a flow rate of 300 μL/min using the following
multistep gradient elution program: linear gradient 20–95%
B from 0 to 1 min, 95% B from 1 to 3.5 min, and 20% B from 3.5 to
7.5 min. Mass spectrometric detection of the analytes was accomplished
using the TurboIonSpray interface operated in the positive ionization
mode. The analyte response was measured by the multiple-reaction monitoring
of selective mass transitions for each compound. The transitions of
the protonated precursor ions to the selected product ions were from m/z 503 to m/z 353 for K-604 and from m/z 507
to m/z 353 for K-604-d4 (internal standard).

Analysis of the Brain Lipid
Components after Intranasal Administration
for 7 Days
The level of cholesterol was measured by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) using a previously reported method.8,12 The cerebrum was homogenized in saline and diluted with saline to
10 times the tissue sample volume. Lipids were extracted from the
tissue homogenate solution (1 mL) with a mixed solution of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v, 3 mL) and water (1 mL) followed by vortexing
for 1 min and centrifugation at 2330 × g for
10 min at room temperature. After removal of the aqueous layer, the
organic layer was equally divided into two portions: one for total
sterol (with saponification) quantification and the other for free
sterol (without saponification) quantification. The organic layer
was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream. EtOH (1 mL) and
a solution of 10 M KOH in aqueous 70% EtOH (300 μL) were added
to the drying residue. The resulting mixture was incubated at 80 °C
for 1 h. After saponification, CHCl3 (2 mL) and water (2.5
mL) were added to the mixture followed by vortexing for 1 min and
centrifugation at 2330 × g for 10 min at room
temperature. Then the organic layer was evaporated to dryness under
a nitrogen stream. A mixture of i-PrOH/CH3CN (55:45, v/v, 50 μL) was added to the drying residue. A total
of 10 μL of the sample solution was evaporated to dryness under
a nitrogen stream. For the silylation of cholesterol, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (100 μL)
was added to the dried residue. The solution was vigorously mixed
by vortexing and incubated for 60 min at 60 °C followed by incubation
for 48 h at 25 °C to obtain the trimethylsilyl esters and ethers.
An aliquot of this sample was injected into a gas chromatograph (GC-2010
Ultra; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer
(GCMS-QP2010 Ultra). A fused silica capillary column (DB-5MS, phenyl
arylene polymer, 30 × 0.25 mm2; Agilent Technologies,
Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used. Helium was used as the carrier gas at
a flow rate of 1.41 mL/min. The temperature program increased the
temperature from 50 to 250 °C at 20 °C/min and from 250
to 325 °C at 5 °C/min. The injector temperature was set
to 280 °C, and the temperatures of the transfer lines to the
mass detector and ion source were 280 and 200 °C, respectively.
The electron energy was set to 70 eV. Cholesterol was identified based
on retention times and mass patterns; ions with m/z 458 for cholesterol were selected for quantification.
Cholesterol was quantitatively identified using cholesterol-d7 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA)
as an internal standard.

Histological Evaluation of Respiratory and
Olfactory Epithelia
and Lung (with Bronchus)
The nasal cavity was fixed in 10%
neutral buffered formalin and sectioned transversely at the anterior
end of the olfactory bulb according to the literature.43 Paraffin sections were cut to 3 to 5 μm
thick and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The thickness of
the respiratory and olfactory epithelia was examined using hematoxylin
and eosin staining. The mean thickness was measured at four random
points in the dorsal portions of both sides of the nasal septum (magnification,
400×). All measurements were performed by the same observer.
Lung tissue (with bronchus) was fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin,
and paraffin-embedded lung sections (3 to 5 μm thick) were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin.

Results and Discussion
Estimation
of the BBB Penetration Ratio of K-604
To
estimate the potential brain permeability of K-604, we simulated the
BBB penetration ratio of carbamazepine and K-604 using StarDrop and
ADMET Predictor software, respectively. Carbamazepine44,45 is the brain-targeting agent used primarily for the treatment of
epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Here, we considered the BBB permeability
value of carbamazepine as a positive control. The BBB log(Cbrain/Cblood) values
of carbamazepine and K-604 were calculated to be −0.063 and
−0.879, respectively, by StarDrop, and the carbamazepine and
K-604 values were estimated to be −0.181 and −0.631,
respectively, by ADMET Predictor (Table 1).

Table 1 Simulation of the
BBB log(Cbrain/Cblood) Values
of Carbamazepine and K-604
method	carbamazepine
BBB log(Cbrain/Cblood)	K-604 BBB log(Cbrain/Cblood)	
StarDrop	–0.063	–0.879	
ADMET Predictor	–0.181	–0.631	
As expected, carbamazepine exhibited
a high BBB penetration ratio.
In contrast, K-604 exhibited a moderate degree of BBB penetration;
there was a significant overlap of both distributions (CNS–
and CNS+)33 with log(Cbrain/Cblood) values of −1
and 0 (BBB classification of StarDrop). These simulations suggested
that K-604 might penetrate the BBB and potentially be delivered to
the brain. Next, we evaluated the BBB permeability of K-604 using
the in vitro BBB Kit.

In Vitro Evaluation of the BBB Permeability
of K-604
The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) (21.9
× 10–6 cm/s) of K-604 across the BBB was lower
than that of carbamazepine (47.8 × 10–6 cm/s),
which was used as a positive control agent in the BBB Kit evaluation
system. The results of the experiment examining BBB permeability were
almost consistent with the aforementioned simulation (carbamazepine
BBB permeability = log(Cbrain/Cblood) = −0.063 to −0.181). Regarding
the actual feasibility of oral administration, the delivery efficiency
of K-604 is not expected to be as high as that of carbamazepine, and
systemic adverse effects may result from high doses. Therefore, we
aimed to develop an alternative drug delivery to replace oral administration
and focused on intranasal administration to noninvasively deliver
therapeutic drugs from the nose to the brain along the olfactory and
trigeminal pathways, bypassing the BBB. Although several papers have
introduced the potential utility of this method,20−22 few cases have
successfully applied intranasal administration of a drug to mice or
rats and demonstrated sufficient exposure in the brain. Before performing
intranasal administration, innovative modifications were required
to obtain a high K-604 solubility in aqueous solution to ensure a
high exposure level in the brain. We noted the utility of the chemical
structures of HA,46 GA, and CA as shown
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Chemical structures
of hyaluronic acid, d-gluconic acid,
and citric acid.

These hydroxycarboxylic
acids enable the strong counterionic interaction
between the carboxylate group and the amine moiety of K-604. Furthermore,
the multiple hydroxyl groups allow for strong interaction with water,
playing roles in solvating and hydrating the transamine moiety of
K-604 and resulting in increased aqueous solubility. Accordingly,
the solubility of K-604 could be enhanced despite the acidic pH and
released from strong acidic invasion into the olfactory epithelial
tissue. We next investigated the aqueous solubility of K-604 in the
presence of these additives.

Solubility Studies on K-604 in Different
Vehicles
The
K-604 concentrations in different solution formulations are presented
in Table 2.

Table 2 K-604 Solubility in Different Vehicles
vehicle	additive	K-604 solubility	pH	
water	 	0.05 mg/mL	6.8	
0.01 N HCl	 	3.24 mg/mL	2.3	
0.05 N HCl	 	19 mg/mL	1.3	
HA	5 mg	10.8 mg/mL	3.8	
GA	4 mg (0.04 M)	10.8 mg/mL	3.6	
CA	7.7 mg (0.04 M)	10.8 mg/mL	3.0	
Although an extremely high aqueous solubility
(19 mg/mL) of K-604
has been reported at pH 1.2,17 this solution
formulation is very invasive to nasal epithelial tissues because of
its corrosive acidity. When using a 0.01 N HCl solution, the acidity
was somewhat weakened to 2.3, but the solubility decreased to 3.24
mg/mL. The pH values of the aqueous K-604 solutions containing HA,
GA, or CA were determined to be 3.8, 3.6, and 3.0, respectively. Notably,
all three additives resulted in the same solubility (K-604 10.8 mg/mL,
0.02 M). As expected, these hydroxycarboxylic acids, namely, HA, GA,
and CA, were found to be favorable solvation additives.

In Vivo Monitoring
of Stained Tissues along the Intranasal Route
To monitor
the drug delivery route from the nose to the brain along
olfactory nerve bundles, we intranasally administered uranine to mice
As shown in Figure 3, yellow-colored tissues (group A1, No. 1) stained by uranine were
visually observable, while the group administered with 0.01 N HCl
was not stained (group A2, No. 1).

Figure 3 Sliced yellow-colored tissues of the olfactory
bulb, cerebellum,
and cerebrum stained by uranine, which contrasted with the unstained
tissue treated with a 0.01 N HCl solution.

This result visually indicated the existence of a drug delivery
route from the nose to the brain. Before intranasally administering
the K-604 solution formulation to mice, we investigated the scope
and limitation of drug delivery to the brain by oral administration.

In Vivo PK Study after Single Oral Administration (K-604, 6
mg/kg) to Mice
The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of K-604 was 6.2 ng/mL at 15 min after
administration. The time of peak concentration (Tmax) in the cerebrum and cerebellum tissue was 15 min
after administration, and the Cmax values
were 0.8 and 0.7 ng/g, respectively. These concentrations were less
than the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 60 min after treatment
administration. It is noteworthy that the magnitude of these Cmax values was markedly different from the plasma Cmax value (6.2 ng/mL). The drug concentrations
in the olfactory bulb tissue were less than the LLOQ at all points
as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Drug concentration–time profiles in the plasma, cerebrum,
cerebellum, and olfactory bulb tissue after single oral administration
(K-604, 6 mg/kg) to female mice. Each point represents the mean ±
SD (n = 5). The LLOQ of the cerebrum and cerebellum
samples was 0.5 ng/g, and the LLOQ of the olfactory bulb tissue sample
was 1 ng/g.

Table 3 illustrates
the PK parameters after single oral administration of K-604 to mice
at a dose of 6 mg/kg (166 μg of K-604/mouse). The AUC of the
cerebral tissue was 8.9 ng·min/g, whereas that of the plasma
was 197.5 ng·min/mL. Interestingly, the feasibility of drug detection
in the cerebral tissue sample was well supported by not only the BBB
permeability predictions of StarDrop and ADMET Predictor but also
by evaluation using the in vitro BBB Kit. These tools were useful
for estimating BBB permeability before conducting an in vivo PK study.
Accordingly, we concluded that oral administration inefficiently delivered

In Vivo PK Study after Single and Repeated Intranasal Administration
of a 0.01 N HCl Solution (50 μL) of K-604 to Mice
Figure 5 illustrates the
PK profiles of plasma, cerebrum, and olfactory bulb tissue after single
and repeated (7 days) intranasal administration of K-604 (162 μg/50
μL) to mice. With single administration, the Cmax values of the plasma, cerebrum, and olfactory bulb
tissues were 574 ng/mL, 66 ng/g, and 406 ng/g, respectively. With
repeated administrations, the Cmax values
of the plasma, cerebrum, and olfactory bulb tissues were 870 ng/mL,
83 ng/g, and 285 ng/g, respectively. As shown in the overlapping drug
concentration–time curves of the single and repeated administration
effects, there is almost no difference between the two drug concentration–time
profiles. We concluded that intranasal administration represents not
only a stable and reproducible drug delivery method but also a safe
method because the drug can be quickly eliminated from the tissues
without side effects due to accumulation. In the initial time range
(after 5 to 45 min) after administration of 50 μL of K-604,
the drug concentrations (870, 449, 250, and 77 ng/mL) in the plasma
were approximately 6- to 10-fold higher than those (83, 44, 32, and
12 ng/g) in the cerebral tissue. In fact, the discrepancy between
the plasma AUC (20680 ng·min/mL) and the olfactory AUC (4806
ng·min/g) significantly expanded. This result suggested that
the K-604 solution formulation might overflow from the olfactory route
to the lung tissue and digestive tract and then absorb into and travel
through the bloodstream to reach all parts of the body and partially
reach the cerebral tissues. To suppress the overflow of the solution
from the nasal route into the other tissues, we minimized the volume
of the K-604 solution formulation from 50 to 10 μL and intranasally
administered the reduced volume.

and olfactory bulb tissue after single and repeated (7 days) intranasal
administration of a 0.01 N HCl solution (K-604, 162 μg/50 μL)
to mice. Each point represents mean ± SD (n =
5). The LLOQs of the cerebrum and olfactory bulb tissue samples were
0.5 and 1 ng/g, respectively.

In Vivo PK Study after Repeated Intranasal Administration of
a 0.01 N HCl Solution (10 μL) of K-604 to Mice
Even
with the reduced volume (32.4 μg/10 μL) of the 0.01 N
HCl solution, the drug concentrations (21, 8.9, 4.5, 2.1, 0.8 ng/g)
in the cerebral tissue could be clearly detected at 5, 15, 30, 45,
and 60 min after intranasal administration (Figure 6). The Cmax of
K-604 (156 ng/g) in the olfactory bulb
tissue exceeded that of K-604 (146 ng/mL) in the plasma. In the initial
time range (from 5 to 45 min) after administration of 10 μL
of K-604, the drug concentrations (142, 90, 33, and 10 ng/mL) in the
plasma were slightly higher than those (156, 51, 15, and 6 ng/g) in
the olfactory bulb tissue. Actually, the discrepancy between the plasma
AUC (2989 ng·min/mL) and the olfactory AUC (2113 ng·min/g)
markedly reduced. Thus, these results suggested that the overflow
of the K-604 solution formulation from the olfactory route into the
other tissues could be suppressed and improved. The cerebrum AUC was
367 ng·min/g with an intranasal dose of 32.4 μg per mouse,
whereas the cerebrum AUC was 9 ng·min/g with an oral dose of
166 μg per mouse. Here, we demonstrated that intranasal administration
efficiently delivered K-604 to the brain.

and olfactory bulb tissue after repeated intranasal administration
of a 0.01 N HCl solution (K-604, 32.4 μg/10 μL) to mice
for 7 days. Each point represents mean ± SD (n = 5). The LLOQs for the cerebrum and olfactory bulb tissue samples
were 0.5 and 1 ng/g, respectively.

Figure 7 illustrates
the drug concentration ratios of cerebrum-to-plasma and olfactory
bulb to plasma (Kp value) as a function
of time after repeated intranasal administration of K-604 (10 and
50 μL). In the olfactory bulb to plasma ratio, the Kp value of the 10 μL volume (1.18) was higher than
that of the 50 μL volume (0.32) at 5 min after administration.
In the initial time range (after 5 to 45 min), the drug concentrations
in the olfactory bulb tissue were 3- to 7-fold and 1- to 3-fold higher
than those in the cerebral tissue, respectively. These results revealed
that a small volume (10 μL/mouse) could be more efficient than
a large volume (50 μL/mouse). We established that K-604 could
be efficiently delivered along the olfactory route to the brain via
intranasal administration while minimizing systemic circulation in
the lung and digestive tract.

In Vivo PK Study after Single Intranasal Administration of Hydroxycarboxylic
Acid Solution (10 μL) of K-604 to Mice
To further increase
the drug exposure in the cerebral tissue, we tested highly concentrated
solutions of K-604, which had solubilities that were increased by
approximately 3-fold with the addition of HA, GA, or CA.

Figure 8 illustrates the
PK profiles of the plasma, cerebrum, and olfactory bulb tissue after
single intranasal administration of the K-604 solution formulations
containing HA, GA, or CA (108 μg/10 μL K-604) to mice.
At 5 min after intranasal administration of 108 μg of K-604
per mouse, the Cmax values of the plasma
were 274, 217, and 283 ng/mL, respectively, and the Cmax values of the cerebral tissue were 39, 32, and 47 ng/g, respectively.
Additionally, the AUCs of the plasma with these formulations were
10220, 7263, and 9891 ng·min/mL, respectively, and those of cerebral
tissue were 791, 579, and 772 ng·min/g, respectively.

of the cerebral and olfactory bulb tissue samples were 0.5 and 1 ng/g,

Table 4 illustrates
the PK parameters of the plasma, cerebrum, and olfactory bulb tissue
after intranasal administration of the 0.01 N HCl, HA, GA, or CA solution
formulation (10 μL) to mice. The Cmax values of the cerebrum and olfactory bulb tissues with the CA solution
formulation were somewhat higher than those with the HA and GA solution
formulations. To assess the brain-targeting efficiency (BTE) of nasal
and oral administration, the BTE index of the cerebrum Cmax and AUC at an intranasal dose of 32.4 or 108 μg
per mouse was calculated on the basis of the cerebrum Cmax and AUC at an oral dose of 166 μg of K-604 per
mouse according to the following equations: 1   2

were calculated from the average concentrations of five mice. Data

respectively.

Interestingly,
the 0.01 N HCl solution showed the highest BTE index
values in the Cmax and AUC categories
among all solution formulations (Table 5). The AUC BTE indices of the hydroxycarboxylic acid
solutions were more than 100-fold but lower than that of the 0.01
N HCl solution. To our knowledge, this result was the first clear
output to demonstrate the concrete feasibility of intranasally administering
the drug.26,47−52 The Cmax BTE indices of all the hydroxycarboxylic
acids (HA, GA, and CA) solution formulations were relatively moderate
and scattered compared to that of the 0.01 N HCl solution. We speculated
that the hydroxycarboxylic acids might be prone to partial crystallization
from the saturated solutions in the process of absorption from the
mucous layer, epithelial membrane, and junctional barrier along the
olfactory route. Moreover, the hydroxycarboxylic acid solution formulations
precipitated as crystals after the solutions were allowed to stand
for an entire day and night at room temperature (10–20 °C).
The CA solution formulation was superior to the other solution formulations
in both the Cmax and AUC BTE categories.
Our final interest was to evaluate whether K-604 has the therapeutic
potential to alter lipid profiles in the brain even with a short exposure
time. Therefore, we selected the CA solution formulation to intranasally
administer K-604 to mice for 7 days and measured the brain cholesterol
level as an indicator of the pharmacological efficacy of this ACAT-1
inhibitor.

Brain Lipid
Profiles after Intranasal Administration of K-604
to Mice for 7 Days
Notably, K-604 dramatically decreased
the CE levels from 0.70 to 0.04 μmol/g in the brains of mice
even after a single daily dose administration for 7 days (Figure 9). This was an outstanding
effect, that is, 94% reduction in the CE level in vivo using only
a trace amount of K-604, that we never observed in other tissues,
including the systemic plasma, liver, adrenal, and intestine, when
evaluating ACAT inhibitors in atherosclerosis models.17 In the brain, a large pool of cholesterol exists as free
cholesterol in the myelin sheath to support the saltatory conduction
of action potentials, and a small portion of cholesterol is found
in the plasma and subcellular membranes of neurons and glial cells.
Because myelin has a very slow turnover rate, myelin-associated cholesterol
is virtually immobilized. Brain cholesterol also plays roles in controlling
synapse formation.53 Brain cholesterol
cannot be supplied from systemic plasma cholesterol because the BBB
prevents cholesterol transportation between the blood and the brain.
Therefore, brain cholesterol is locally produced, and its level is
maintained by converting surplus cholesterol (1) into
24S-OHC (3) via the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase
(CYP46A1). 24S-OHC can be excreted from the brain to the systemic
circulation through the BBB. A fraction of CE (2) was
also present in the brain. This cholesterol metabolism10 is depicted in Figure 10.

intranasal administration of the CA solution (108 μg/10 μL
K-604) to mice with a single daily dose for 7 days. The TC and CE
levels represent the average of five mice.

(2) and 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (3) in the brain.

Focusing on CEs, lipid
droplets are subcellular organelles that
store large amounts of neutral lipids, triglycerides, and/or CEs and
are interestingly found in some aggressive tumor tissues. Geng et
al. have recently reported that lipid droplets are prevalent in GBM,
the most malignant glioma, but are not detectable in benign brain
tumors and normal brain tissues.54,55 The authors
suggested that the suppression of CE production by ACAT-1 inhibitors
should be a therapeutic target in GBM. Furthermore, Bryleva et al.
reported that ablation of the ACAT-1 gene in an AD model mouse ameliorates
amyloid pathology by increasing 24S-OHC content in the brain.56 The physiological range of 24S-OHC has been
shown to have an inhibitory effect on Aβ production.57 Because intranasal administration of K-604 demonstrated
efficacious ACAT-1 inhibition even in a short exposure period, less
than 2 h, K-604 should provide promising results for the treatment
of GBM and AD.58

Histological Evaluations
of Respiratory and Olfactory Epithelium
and Lung (with Bronchus) after Intranasal Administration of K-604
Using Acidic Solutions
We evaluated the histological findings
of respiratory and olfactory epithelium (Figures 11 and 12) and lung
with bronchus after intranasal administration of the acidic solutions
of K-604 with a single daily dose for 7 days.

Figure 11 Hematoxylin and eosin
staining of respiratory epithelium (bar =
50 μm). The observation grades (−: normal, ±: minimal,
1+: slight)59 were comprehensively determined
by the depth degree and number of desquamations that progressed from
degeneration and necrosis, as shown by the representative histological
findings regarding the respiratory epithelia from groups D1, D2, and
B7.

Figure 12 Hematoxylin and eosin staining of olfactory
epithelium (bar = 50
μm). The observation grades (−: normal, 0: within normal
limits, ±: minimal, 1+: slight, 2+: moderate) were comprehensively
determined by the depth degree and number of desquamation that progressed
from degeneration and necrosis as shown by the representative histological
findings regarding the olfactory epithelia from groups D1, B17, and
B7.

As anticipated, intranasal administration
of 50 μL of the
0.01 N HCl solution formulation caused an overflow from the olfactory
route to the lung tissue and induced interstitial inflammation and
basophilic bronchiole epithelia (Figure 13). However, administration of a minimized
volume (10 μL) made it possible to avoid the abovementioned
adverse effects. Even more surprisingly, the olfactory epithelia (from
five mice) were not injured at all despite the strong acidic medium
(pH 2.3) as shown in Table 6 (group B17). We presumed that the mucus layer might play
a role in protecting the direct invasion of epithelial cells by a
trace quantity of HCl solution. Importantly, drug absorption did not
proceed or accelerate as a result of olfactory epithelium disruption
and was simply followed by absorption via the paracellular, transcellular,
and/or neuronal pathway.

Although
the acidic pH values of the hydroxycarboxylic acid solution
formulations (pH 3.0 to 3.8) were weaker than that of the 0.01 N HCl
solution (pH 2.3), they unexpectedly resulted in minimal (±)
and slight (1+) invasion observation grades in both epithelial tissues
assessed (Table 7).
To elucidate the epithelial invasion of these formulations, we investigated
the relationships between the thickness (shrinkage damage) of the
olfactory epithelium60,61 and the drug concentration of
K-604 in each tissue at 120 min after intranasal administration for
7 days (Supporting Information). Hence,
we verified the working hypothesis that the drug concentration of
K-604 in the olfactory bulb could be markedly increased by decreasing
or disrupting the thickness of olfactory epithelial cells, leading
to enhanced drug permeability. In the scatter plots of the three hydroxycarboxylic
acid solution groups (D2-HA, D3-GA, and D4-CA), the relationships
between the olfactory epithelial thickness (μm) and the drug
concentration of K-604 (ng/g) are presented (Figure 14).

As shown in Figure 14, the three hydroxycarboxylic acid solution
formulations interestingly
distributed a variety of drug concentrations irrespective of the olfactory
epithelial thickness. The characteristic results of the three vehicles
are summarized as follows. (1) The HA formulation (D2-HA group) fell
into the relatively higher drug concentration category. (2) The CA
formulation (D4-CA group) fell into the significantly lower drug concentration
category despite showing the highest Cmax of the olfactory bulb among the three groups. (3) The GA formulation
(D3-GA group) formed a population at the median in both drug concentration
and epithelial thickness categories. Given the reasons for these physiologically
different results, HA played a role in retaining the drug in the nasal
cavity for a longer period, as reported in the literature.62,63 In contrast, CA seemed to behave as an absorption enhancer64 and thus might reversibly modify the structure
of the epithelial barrier. We assume that GA, which has multiple hydroxyl
groups, can strongly interact with multiple alcohols and the amine
moiety of K-604 to develop a tight GA and K-604 complex, thus minimizing
its range of distribution. Pujara et al. investigated the effect of
pH, osmolarity, type (acetate, adipate, citrate, and phosphate), and
concentration of buffers on the nasal mucosal epithelium in rats using
an in situ nasal perfusion technique.65 In their report, phosphate buffers (0.07 M) with pH values between
3 and 10 exerted very low or essentially similar impacts, while buffers
with pH values above 10 and below 3 seemed to result in both membrane
and intracellular damage. Furthermore, the effect of buffer concentrations
on the rat nasal mucosa was studied using acetate buffer (pH 4.75)
at three different concentrations (0.07, 0.14, and 0.21 M). The damage
to the nasal mucosa by acetate buffers was concentration-dependent.
When considering the above results together, we suspect that a high
drug concentration (108 μg/10 μL K-604) of the hydroxycarboxylic
acid solution formulation might damage the respiratory and olfactory
epithelial cell integrity more than a low concentration of the 0.01
N HCl solution (32.4 μg/10 μL K-604) irrespective of the
acidic pH of vehicles. As a dramatic reduction (94%) of the brain
CE level was attained during a short period, even a low concentration
of K-604 could be pharmacologically expected and would be clinically
promised.

Conclusions
The present study revealed
several issues that we raised in the Introduction. Intranasal administration has long
been expected to be a potentially useful method to deliver therapeutic
agents to the brain. However, until now, there has been no substantially
good example of this method. In our study, we first clarified the
olfactory route used to deliver the drug from nose to the brain by
observing the yellow-stained tissues from the olfactory bulb to the
cerebellum and cerebrum using uranine. Second, we conducted a simulation
of the brain penetration ratio of K-604 using the software StarDrop
and ADMET Predictor and evaluated the drug BBB permeability of K-604
using an in vitro BBB Kit. The simple prediction of the BBB permeability
was consistent with the in vitro BBB permeability and was a useful
tool before the conduction of in vivo experiments. Third, we succeeded
in improving the aqueous solubility of K-604, making use of hydrogen
bonding using hydroxycarboxylic acid solutions as vehicles. Fourth,
we demonstrated that intranasal administration enhanced the drug delivery
efficiency as measured by an AUC that was by approximately 100- to
211-fold higher than that achieved with oral administration. Fifth,
K-604 was very effectively targeted to the mouse brain where it decreased
CE levels from 0.70 to 0.04 μmol/g with only a single daily
dose for 7 days. Sixth, we clarified that the olfactory epithelium
damage was not directly related to the enhancement of K-604 delivery
to the olfactory bulb and cerebrum. Based on the above results, we
have established a potential intranasal administration method to efficiently
deliver K-604 into the brain for the treatment of GBM and AD. We still
need to explore the feasible dosage of K-604 with a combination of
optimal vehicles in practical applications in the future.
