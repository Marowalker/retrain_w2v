Developing visible-light-regulated
controlled/living radical polymerization
techniques for the synthesis of polymers with a predictable molecular
weight, spatial and temporal control, and well-defined end-group functionality
is being pursued by the macromolecular community worldwide. In this
study, a new metal-free photoinduced electron transfer-reversible
addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization system
was developed for controlled macromolecular synthesis in both heterogeneous
and homogeneous systems by structural engineering of graphitic carbon
nitrides (g-C3N4) to improve the textural, optical,
and electronic properties. A heteroatom-mediated synthesis enabled
the preparation of g-C3N4 with improved structural
properties and increased absorption in the visible light region. Enhanced
PET-RAFT polymerization of vinyl monomers with low dispersity (Đ < 1.2), temporal control, and high chain-end
fidelity was achieved under mild blue light irradiation (λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2). Moreover, we demonstrate,
for the first time, that the g-C3N4-catalyzed
RAFT polymerization could be realized in a homogeneous system after
structural evolution of bulk g-C3N4 into soluble
nanosheets with enhanced photocatalytic efficiency up to high monomer
conversion. This study provides new insights into the structure–performance
relationship of g-C3N4 for photoregulated PET-RAFT
polymerization under visible light. Moreover, the development of a
homogeneous g-C3N4-catalyzed photosynthesis
system should broaden the application scope of these fascinating photocatalysts
while benefiting synthetic upscaling by continuous flow and/or microfluidic
reactors.

1 Introduction
The booming development of photocatalysis and artificial photosynthesis
has inspired polymer chemists to exploit light to regulate macromolecular
synthesis for better control over the polymerization process.1 During the past few years, photomediated controlled/living
radical polymerizations (CRPs) have aroused tremendous research enthusiasm.2−6 These techniques enable the tailored synthesis of polymers with
a determined molecular weight (MW), low dispersity, and chain-end
fidelity. More importantly, by employing light as an external stimulus
to manipulate the deactivation–activation equilibrium of the
propagating and dormant chains, these techniques afford spatial and
temporal control over the polymerization process.7,8

One of the major challenges to establish a photoregulated CLRP
system is to develop a highly efficient and robust photocatalyst,
which can initiate polymerization through either an energy transfer
or a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) pathway while regulating
the activation–deactivation equilibrium for the controlled
growth of polymer chains.9 Taking advantage
of the research advances of photoredox catalysis, the pioneering groups
of photoregulated CLRPs, such as Hawker and Fors,10−13 Matyjaszewski,14−16 Boyer,17−24 Yagci,25−28 Miyake,29−31 and others, have identified a series of photocatalysts
including metal-containing complexes (fac-Ir(ppy)3, Ru(bpy)3Cl2, ZnTPP), organic dyes, semiconductors, and
naturally derived compounds applicable for atom transfer radical polymerization
(ATRP) and/or reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)
polymerization.32−39 To prevent metal contamination in the product, more attention has
been paid to the development of metal-free and environmentally benign
photocatalytic systems.

Graphitic carbon nitride, usually denoted
as g-C3N4, represents a class of attractive
metal-free photocatalysts.40,41 Due to the appealing
electronic band property, high physicochemical
stability, “earth-abundant” nature, and facile synthesis,
graphitic carbon nitride has been a research hotspot in the arena
of solar energy conversion since the creative work of Antonietti in
2009, reporting the potential of the conjugated semiconductor material
for visible-light-induced water splitting for H2 production.42 Yagci and co-workers then bridged graphitic
carbon nitrides and macromolecular synthesis, achieving successful
photoinduced free radical polymerization43 and ATRP44 under UV light. Recently,
the group led by Qiao developed a robust UV-light-regulated RAFT polymerization
system using urea-derived g-C3N4 that showed
improved oxygen tolerance in the presence of an amine cocatalyst.45 These successes have drawn considerable interest
in the field, however, for pristine g-C3N4,
no absorption above 460 nm, low electronic conductivity, high recombination
rate of charge carriers, and poor dispersibility remain obstacles
to their applications in visible-light-mediated CLRPs.46,47

Achievable strategies to improve the photoactivity of graphitic
carbon nitrides include tailored synthesis (elemental doping, postfunctionalization,
supramolecular preorganization, etc.), nanoarchitecture fabrication,
and electronic structure modulation.48−53 Regarding the synthetic protocols, heteroatom-mediated synthesis
generated g-C3N4 with improved textural, optical,
and electronic properties.54−56 Meanwhile, when subject to controllable
thermal–chemical etching treatment, bulk g-C3N4 could be converted to nanosheets, nanoribbons, and even quantum
dots, making them versatile for more photocatalytic systems.57

We present here a new and efficient metal-free
PET-RAFT polymerization
system based on structural tuning of a sulfur-containing precursor-derived
graphitic carbon nitride. The presence of sulfur species regulated
the thermal condensation process of the precursor, resulting in g-C3N4 products with improved porosity, electronic
structure, and absorption in visible light range. Thus, enhanced PET-RAFT
polymerization of vinyl monomers with temporal control, low dispersity,
and chain-end fidelity was achieved. Moreover, the g-C3N4 could be further transformed into nanosheets with good
optical properties and solubility in polar solvents, enabling the
development of the first homogeneous g-C3N4-catalyzed
PET-RAFT polymerization system under visible light irradiation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Graphitic Carbon Nitride
Synthesis and Characterization
Photoactivity of graphitic
carbon nitrides in photoredox catalysis
depends on their microstructure, optical and electronic properties,
which can be improved by rationally controlling the synthesis procedure.
In this work, a sulfur-mediated synthetic protocol, using trithiocyanuric
acid (TCA) as the precursor, was employed to prepare the graphitic
carbon nitride (denoted as “TCA-g-C3N4”) used for visible-light-regulated RAFT polymerizations.
It has been reported that precursors containing heteroatoms in addition
to nitrogen exhibit positive influence in the thermal polycondensation.
The big-sized sulfur atom is expected to modify the conformation and
connection of the resultant graphitic carbon nitrides while tuning
their textural and physicochemical properties.40 Meanwhile, a conventional melamine-derived graphitic carbon
nitride (denoted “MA-g-C3N4”)
was also prepared for a comparative study.

The morphology of
the as-prepared g-C3N4 was characterized by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Typically, MA-g-C3N4 exhibits irregular particles and sheets without determinate
size (Figure 1a), while
a well-developed porous structure with thin walls was observed for
TCA-g-C3N4 (Figure 1b), suggesting that the nature of precursor
significantly influenced the morphological evolution during thermal
polycondensation. Basically, for TCA-g-C3N4,
the presence of sulfur atoms in the precursor enabled the generation
of volatile species such as H2S and CS2 that
were released during the reaction (Figure 1f).54,55 This offered a template
tool to mediate the modification of the texture, resulting in g-C3N4 with improved porosity. The digital photos showed
that the as-prepared MA-g-C3N4 and TCA-g-C3N4 were light yellow and brown powders, respectively
(Figure 1c,d). Both
of the g-C3N4 samples could be well-dispersed
in polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), after moderate
ultrasonication (Figure 1e).

and trithiocyanuric acid (TCA-g-C3N4) (b) under
TEM; photographs of MA-g-C3N4 (c) and TCA-g-C3N4 (d) in the solid form and dispersed in DMSO
(left, MA-g-C3N4; right, TCA-g-C3N4) (e); and reaction pathway of thermal polycondensation
of trithiocyanuric acid into g-C3N4 at high
temperature in air (f).

The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns in Figure 2a suggest a graphitic-like layer structure
for MA-g-C3N4 and TCA-g-C3N4. The latter shows intensity decrease and broadening of the signal
peak, which is associated with the volatile sulfur species-mediated
formation of porous structure in TCA-g-C3N4.
The strongest XRD peak located at ca. 27° is determined as the
signal of (002) interlayer reflection, corresponding to an interlayer
distance of d = 0.342 nm. Another identifiable XRD
peak at ca. 13° is ascribed to in-plane repeated units in the
layer structure. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra show
a similar signal peak for the two kinds of g-C3N4 (Figure 2b). The
strong bands at 1600–1200 cm–1 correspond
to the stretching vibration of the heptazine heterocyclic ring (C6H7) system, while the sharp peak at 805 cm–1 is assigned to the breathing mode of the triazine
units.58 Besides, the broad absorbance
at 3300–2900 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching
vibration of residual N–H components.

FT-IR spectra (b) of MA-g-C3N4 and TCA-g-C3N4.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to examine the
surface chemistry of the graphitic carbon nitrides. According to the
wide scan spectra in Figure 3a,b, only C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s signals were found for both
the samples, suggesting that the sulfur atoms were not incorporated
into the frameworks of the graphitic carbon nitrides. This is in accordance
with the previous report that the role of the sulfur species in the
precursor is only to mediate the thermal condensation instead of doping
the g-C3N4.54,55 The presence
of O 1s signal might be due to the adsorbed H2O or CO2 molecules on the surfaces of the g-C3N4 samples. High-resolution XPS spectra show that there are mainly
two carbon species observed in the C 1s spectrum with the binding
energy of 284.9 and 288.2 eV, respectively (Figure 3c,d). The former peak is generally assigned
to the sp2 C–C bonds, while the latter peak is typically
ascribed to sp2-bonded carbons in the heptazine ring system
(N–C=N), which is considered the major carbon species
in the g-C3N4.59 Besides,
deconvolution of high-resolution XPS N 1s spectra of MA-g-C3N4 (Figure 3e) and TCA-g-C3N4 (Figure 3f) suggests that the nitrogen species consisted
of four components. For MA-g-C3N4, the component
signals show peaks at 398.7, 401.0, 401.2, and 404.5 eV. The main
source of the peak at 398.7 eV is from the sp2-bonded nitrogen
in the triazine rings. While the weak peak at 401.0 eV originates
from the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups. Both of
them are the main components of the heptazine heterocyclic ring (C6N7) units, which are the basic substructure units
of the g-C3N4. Another weak peak at 401.2 eV
indicates the presence of residue amino functions (C–N–H)
in the melon structures. In addition, the component signal at 404.5
eV is attributed to the charging effects or positive charge localization
in the heterocycles.59 The component signals
of TCA-g-C3N4 after deconvolution are coincident
with those of MA-g-C3N4 except for a slight
difference in specific binding energy. It is worth mentioning that
a careful scanning of both the graphitic carbon nitrides shows no
signal attributed to S 2p species, which further confirms that there
are no sulfur dopants in the structure of the graphitic carbon nitrides. Table 1 summarizes the content
of corresponding elements in MA-g-C3N4 and TCA-g-C3N4 based on XPS analysis. Higher nitrogen content
was found in the structure of TCA-g-C3N4.

The graphitic carbon nitrides show typical UV–vis
absorption
spectra (Figure 4a)
of semiconductors that originate from electron transition from the
valence band to the conduction band. Compared to MA-g-C3N4, TCA-g-C3N4 shows intensified
absorption in both UV and visible light regions. A red shift of absorption
edge is observed for TCA-g-C3N4, corresponding
to a reduced band gap energy. This might be explained by the extension
of electron delocalization in the aromatic sheets with enhanced structural
connections.54 The photoluminescence spectra
of TCA-g-C3N4 dispersed in DMSO exhibit similar
emission profile yet higher intensity to that of MA-g-C3N4 under the excitation wavelength of 365 nm (Figure 4b). The emission
peaks are located at 434, 544, and 576 nm. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
analysis (Figure 4c)
reveals that the texture of the g-C3N4 samples
is evidently influenced by the precursor type. TCA-g-C3N4 derived from trithiocyanuric acid exhibits a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area of 79 m2/g, much higher than
that (12 m2/g) of the melamine-derived counterpart (Table 1). Besides, a higher
pore volume (0.15 cm3/g) with a larger pore size (9.8 nm)
(Figure 4d) was also
found for TCA-g-C3N4. These results confirmed
that the sulfur-containing precursor-mediated synthesis benefited
the formation of g-C3N4 product with improved
specific surface area and porosity. This synthetic protocol to prepare
highly porous g-C3N4 is facile in operation
that prevents the introduction of extra templates such as silica nanoparticles.43 The highly porous texture of g-C3N4 is supposed to decrease the length of photoinduced
charge transportation while providing more active sites for photocatalytic
reactions.40

2.2 Blue Light-Regulated RAFT Polymerizations
Photoregulated CRP has been recognized as an enabling tool for
controlled synthesis of polymers with a predetermined MW, narrow MW
distribution, and well-defined end-group functionality. Previous studies
demonstrated that graphitic carbon nitrides were of great potential
to catalyze CRPs under UV light irradiation via a photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) pathway.44,45 Here, taking advantage
of the structurally enhanced TCA-g-C3N4, a new
PET-RAFT polymerization system was established under mild blue light-emitting
diode (LED) light (λmax = 465 nm) irradiation (Figure S1). Besides, the structure–performance
relationship of g-C3N4 was evaluated by a comparative
study on the photocatalytic ability of different precursor-derived
g-C3N4.

First, RAFT polymerization of
methyl methacrylate (MMA) was carried out using MA-g-C3N4 and TCA-g-C3N4 as photocatalysts.
Blank experiments showed that, in the absence of either g-C3N4 (Table 2, entry 1) or light irradiation (Table 2, entries 2 and 6), the RAFT polymerization
was not initiated. Meanwhile, the possibility of thermally induced
initiation under light irradiation was ruled out by conducting the
experiment in a dark environment at 45 °C, which resulted in
no polymer product (Table 2, entries 3 and 7). Under blue light irradiation, the MA-g-C3N4-catalyzed RAFT polymerization achieved a conversion
of 33%. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis showed a Mn ∼ 6800 for the polymer product, which
was in agreement with the theoretical value (Table 2, entry 4). In comparison, the TCA-g-C3N4-catalyzed RAFT polymerization system exhibited
enhanced photocatalytic efficiency. A higher Mn ∼ 10 300 for the polymer product with a lower
dispersity (Đ ∼ 1.18) was achieved (Table 2, entry 8).

a The polymerizations were performed
in 1 mL of DMSO using 4-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate (CPADB)
as a chain transfer agent (CTA) for 16 h under irradiation of blue
LED light (λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2). The
molar ratio of [MMA]/[CPADB] is 200:1.

c Monomer conversion was determined
by online Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy.

d The theoretical molecular weight
was calculated according to the equation Mn,theo = [M]0/[CPADB]0 × MWM ×
α + MWCPADB, where [M]0, [CPADB]0, MWM, α, and MWCPADB represent the initial
monomer concentration, initial CPADB concentration, molar mass of
the monomer, conversion, and molar mass of CPADB.

were determined by GPC using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as an eluent.

g The polymerization
was performed
at 45 °C in the dark.

A g-C3N4-catalyzed photo-RAFT polymerization
started by the activation of the chain transfer agents (CTAs) via
electron transfer under light irradiation. The activated CTAs initiated
the polymerization of monomers. The RAFT process was maintained by
chain transfer to other CTA molecules, which resulted in dormant polymer
chains and other propagating chains.45 According
to this mechanism, the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of TCA-g-C3N4 can be attributed to its improved optical property
and specific surface area. The former benefits the absorption in the
blue light range, resulting in more photogenerated electrons. The
latter provides more active sites and facilitates the charge transport,
which would accelerate the activation of the CTAs. Besides, it is
worth noting that, in the absence of CPADB, there were polymer products
generated in the reaction systems catalyzed by either MA-g-C3N4 or TCA-g-C3N4. However, the polymerization
was not controlled due to the absence of a RAFT process to maintain
the reversible degenerate transfer equilibrium. The polymer product
showed a Mn much higher than the theoretical
value and a larger dispersity (Table 2, entries 5 and 9).

2.3 Kinetics
and “On/Off” Experiments
To fully evaluate
the TCA-g-C3N4 catalyzed
RAFT polymerization system, a kinetic study was performed under blue
LED irradiation. A linear relationship between ln([M]0/[M]t) and the irradiation time was observed, corresponding to
pseudo-first-order polymerization kinetics with an apparent rate constant
(kapp) of 6.2 × 10–2 h–1 (Figure 5a and Table S1). This indicated
that the concentration of the propagating radicals was maintained
during the polymerization process. A comparative study on the MA-g-C3N4-catalyzed RAFT polymerization of MMA under the
same conditions resulted in relatively poor kinetic control (Figure S2 and Table S2), which further confirmed
the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of TCA-g-C3N4. GPC profiles with monomodal distribution were obtained for
the polymer product, showing a continuous shift to the high-MW region
with the increase in exposure time (Figure 5b). A linear increase in experimental Mn with monomer conversion was observed, which
was in line with the theoretical estimation (Figure 5c). Meanwhile, increasing monomer conversion
also resulted in a decrease in dispersity and, for the final product,
quite narrow distribution was obtained, indicating a controlled radical
polymerization process.

polymerization of MMA using CPADB as the CTA under blue LED irradiation
(λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2). The molar ratio
of [MMA]/[CPADB] = 200:1 in 1 mL of DMSO: (a) ln([M]0/[M]t) vs irradiation time and the fitted kinetic curve. (b) GPC
profiles of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) synthesized in the kinetic
study. (c) Number average molecular weight (Mn) and dispersity (Đ) of PMMA obtained
in the kinetic study.

One of the significant
advantages of photoregulated RAFT polymerization
is the temporal control with the polymerization process effectively
switching between active and dormant states by controlling the light
“On” and “Off”. To examine whether the
TCA-g-C3N4-catalyzed polymerization of MMA in
DMSO exhibited temporal control, the On/Off light switch experiment
was carried out. Figure 6a shows that the Mn of PMMA increased
linearly with the exposure time in the initial 5 h. The light was
then turned off and the reaction system was maintained in dark for
1 h. It was found that the polymerization was completely suppressed.
Switching on the light resumed the linear chain propagation. Repeated
On/Off experiments suggested that the RAFT polymerization could be
effectively manipulated by light, demonstrating a good temporal control
over the polymerization process. The final polymer product exhibited
a symmetric GPC profile with low dispersity (Đ = 1.10) (Figure 6b).

465 nm, 3 mW/cm2) (a) and the GPC profile of the PMMA prepared
in the On/Off experiment (b).

To further demonstrate the activity of functional end groups of
the polymers prepared by the TCA-g-C3N4-catalyzed
polymerization, chain extension of a PMMA product was attempted. A
macromolecular chain transfer agent (macro-CPADB) (Mn = 9200, Đ = 1.14) was first prepared
by a TCA-g-C3N4-catalyzed RAFT polymerization
under blue LED light irradiation. The preservation of functional end
groups was confirmed by 1H NMR (Figure 7a). The chain extension experiment resulted
in a diblock copolymer with a Mn of 24
600 and a Đ of 1.25 (Figure 7b), suggesting the chain-end fidelity and
living character of the PMMA product.

2.4 Soluble g-C3N4-Catalyzed
RAFT Polymerization
Furthermore, previous research has proved
that 3D bulk g-C3N4 can be transformed into
soluble nanoribbons or nanosheets by facile thermal oxidation and
acidic etching treatment.57 This offers
an opportunity to broaden the application of g-C3N4 in homogeneous photoregulated CRP systems that are expected
to achieve uniform illumination with decreased light scattering. To
reach this end, the as-synthesized TCA-g-C3N4 was subjected to further structural transformation based on an established
procedure57 to generate the nanosized counterpart,
as shown in the TEM image (Figure 8a). The inset suggests that the bulk TCA-g-C3N4 was cut into fragmentized sheets with a preserved porous
structure. A brown solid of the g-C3N4 nanosheets
(Figure 8b) could be
obtained by dialysis purification and redissolved in DMSO (Figure 8c). The XRD pattern
of the TCA-g-C3N4 nanosheets in Figure 9a still shows the signal of
(002) interlayer reflection at ca. 27°. Meanwhile, the characteristic
signal of the triazine units at 805 cm–1 is preserved
in the FT-IR spectrum (Figure 9b).

of TCA-g-C3N4 nanosheets in the solid form (b)
and dissolved in DMSO (c).

(a) and FT-IR spectrum (b) of TCA-g-C3N4 nanosheets.

Finally, the capability of the TCA-g-C3N4 nanosheets for RAFT polymerization of MMA in a homogeneous
system
was evaluated. The polymerization was carried out following the same
recipe as that used in the bulk g-C3N4-catalyzed
heterogeneous systems under blue LED irradiation. An increased monomer
conversion of 72% was achieved after the same irradiation time. The
PMMA product showed a Mn ∼ 14 800
close to the theoretical value and a symmetric GPC profile (Figure 10) with quite narrow
distribution (Đ ∼ 1.08). These results
demonstrated the photocatalytic ability of the TCA-g-C3N4 nanosheets in homogeneous PET-RAFT polymerization.
The improved monomer conversion and a higher MW of the polymer product
in the homogeneous system might be attributed to more efficient mass
transfer and better spatial illumination homogeneity. Besides, the
enhanced photocatalytic ability of g-C3N4 in
the homogeneous system would pave a way for performing photoregulated
CLRPs in microfluidic reactors or continuous flow reactors.

was performed in 1 mL of DMSO using CPADB as CTA under irradiation
of blue LED light (λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2) for 16 h. The molar ratio of [MMA]/[CPADB] was 200:1.

3 Conclusions
The development of new
and efficient metal-free photoinduced electron
transfer (PET) RAFT polymerization systems regulated by visible light
based on the structural engineering of graphitic carbon nitrides is
presented herein. Taking advantage of a heteroatom-modulated synthetic
protocol, graphitic carbon nitrides with improved textural, optical,
and electronic properties were obtained, enabling an enhanced PET-RAFT
polymerization of vinyl monomers under mild blue light irradiation
(λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2). Well-defined
polymers with good control over the molecular weight (MW) and narrow
MW distribution were obtained. The On/Off light switch experiment
showed good temporal control of the photoregulated polymerization
system. Successful chain extension proved the high chain-end fidelity
of the polymer product. Moreover, the graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst
could be transformed into soluble nanosheets when subject to thermal
oxidation and acidic etching. Thus, homogeneous photocatalysis of
PET-RAFT polymerizations using graphitic carbon nitrides was achieved.
Overall, this work provides new insights into the structure–performance
relationship of graphitic carbon nitrides for catalyzing visible-light-regulated
PET-RAFT polymerization. The demonstration of PET-RAFT polymerizations
in a homogeneous system catalyzed by graphitic carbon nitride can
offer new opportunities for broadening their applications in continuous
flow reactors.

to a previously reported method55 by melamine
(MA) and trithiocyanuric acid (TCA) as precursors, respectively.

4.2 Characterizations
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) was performed on JEM-2010 (JEOL). Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iN10 infrared
microscope. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained
on a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, with a scan step of
0.2° and the scan range between 10 and 40°. Nitrogen sorption
isotherms were measured at 77 K on a NOVA 3200e surface area and pore
size analyzer. Before measurement, the samples were degassed in vacuum
at 300 °C for 3 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method was utilized to calculate the specific surface areas. Gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) analysis was performed in a Shimadzu LC-20A GPC
system using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as an eluent. The NIR absorption
spectra between 1600 and 1700 nm (0.1 nm interval) were collected
at room temperature on an Agilent Cary6000i UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed
by a 250XI spectrometer with a mono X-Ray source Al K excitation (1361
eV). Binding energy calibration was based on C 1s at 284.6 eV.

4.3 General Procedure of g-C3N4-Catalyzed
RAFT Polymerization
To perform the RAFT
polymerizations, typically, g-C3N4 (5 mg), MMA
(1 mL, 9.35 mmol), CPADB (13 mg, 0.047 mmol), and DMSO (1 mL) were
mixed in a 20 mL vial glass sealed with a plug-type rubber sleeve
stopper. The molar ratio of [MMA]/[CPADB] was 200:1. After ultrasonication
for 2 min, argon was bubbled to exclude the oxygen in the polymerization
system. Then, the reactant mixture was irradiated under a blue LED
light source (λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2)
placed in a photo studio lighting tent at room temperature. After
a predetermined polymerization time, the resulting solution was separated
and precipitated in ethanol under stirring. The product was collected
by filtration and redissolved in a minimum amount of THF. After the
second precipitation in ethanol, the final polymer product was separated
and dried in a 50 °C oven. The monomer conversion was determined
according to the method reported by Boyer et al. using online Fourier
transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy.20 GPC was utilized to analyze the molecular weight (Mn) and dispersity (Mw/Mn) of the polymers.

4.4 Kinetic Study of g-C3N4-Catalyzed RAFT
Polymerization
A 20 mL glass vial charged
with g-C3N4 (5 mg), MMA (1 mL, 9.35 mmol), CPADB
(13 mg, 0.047 mmol), and DMSO (1 mL) was sealed with a plug-type rubber
sleeve stopper and then protected from light by covering with aluminum
foil. After degassed by gentle Ar bubbling for 20 min, the reaction
solution was irradiated under a blue LED light source (λmax = 465 nm, 3 mW/cm2) at room temperature. Aliquots
of samples were taken at predetermined time intervals for analysis.
The monomer conversions were determined by FT-NIR spectroscopy mentioned
above. The molecular weight (Mn) and dispersity
(Mw/Mn) of
the polymer products were analyzed by GPC.

4.5 On/Off
Light Switch Experiment
Temporal
control of the TCA-g-C3N4-catalyzed RAFT polymerization
under blue LED irradiation was verified by the light switch experiment.
The experimental conditions and pretreatment of the reaction system
were the same as those described in the kinetic study. At a predetermined
reaction time, the light source was turned off and the polymerization
system was maintained in the dark for a period of time. The reaction
was then reactivated by turning on the LED light. This On/Off cycle
was repeated during the polymerization process. Samples were taken
with a degassed syringe at timed intervals under both light and dark
conditions for FT-NIR measurements and GPC analysis.
