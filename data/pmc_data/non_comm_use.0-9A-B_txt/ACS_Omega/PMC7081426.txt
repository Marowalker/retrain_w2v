Fabrication
of a nanocomposite catalyst via a novel and efficient
strategy remains a challenge; Fe3O4 nanoparticles
anchored on graphene oxide (GO) sheet-supported metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs). In this study, the physicochemical properties of the ensuing
Fe3O4/Cu-BDC/GO are investigated using Fourier
transform infrared spectrum, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive
X-ray detector, and atomic absorption spectroscopy. The salient features
of the nanocomposite such as Cu-MOF, synergistic effect with GO sheets,
and magnetic separation characteristics make it an excellent ternary
heterostructure for aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The proposed nanocatalyst
and co-catalyst 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl
substantially enhance the catalytic performance for the aerobic oxidation
under very mild and sustainable reaction conditions. The heterogeneity
of Fe3O4/Cu-BDC/GO composite catalyst is affirmed
with the added advantage that the initial activity is well maintained
even after seven cycles.

1 Introduction
The
catalytic selective oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding
carbonyl compounds is a vital and common transformation for the development
of industrial organic chemistry.1,2 The increasing demand
for clean synthesis has stimulated the development of efficient metal-free
oxidation protocols. A family of stable nitroxide radicals, [2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl] (TEMPO) and its derivatives, have garnered great
interest owing to their high catalytic efficiency and chemoselectivity
under environmentally friendly conditions;3 several TEMPO-catalyzed systems have displayed notable accomplishments.4 For example, Karimi’s team developed the
mesoporous materials such as SBA-15,5 MCM-41,6 and PMO7 as supports
for TEMPO. Reiser et al. developed a highly efficient supported catalyst
using click reaction to connect TEMPO radical to multiple perfluoroalkyl
chains for the oxidation of alcohols.8 Wang
and co-workers utilized the core/shell SPS-CuII@Cu-BTC
catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of alcohols by TEMPO.9 Recently, copper(II) complexes combined with
TEMPO radicals10,11 have been proved to have an excellent
catalytic performance for selective aerobic oxidation of alcohols.
Besides this, benefitting from the potential catalytic sites offered
by metal complexes and nanoparticles (NPs), the performance of heterogeneous
catalysts could even outperform the corresponding homogeneous counterparts
because of the synergetic effect.12,13 Although these
methods can circumvent many disadvantages of homogeneous catalysis,
typical problems such as a low immobilization capacity, metal leaching,
poor catalytic activity and selectivity, etc. still persist.14,15

To attain high catalytic activity, nanostructuring catalysts
with
a porous character would be an essential way to expose accessible
active sites. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class
of hybrid microporous materials with well-organized structures, which
have opened up new avenues for multifarious applications.16 In the field of composite nanoarchitecture,
MOF/graphene oxide (GO) has emerged as a new class of catalytic composite
materials due to their specific electrical and surface properties,
excellent conductivity, and hydrophilic character;17−19 composite material
developed by Bandosz’s group20,21 has been found
to be more stable and efficient. In addition, Cai and co-workers demonstrated
a novel Europium-based MOFs [MIL-LIC-1(Eu)]/GO composite with application
in aerobic oxidation of alcohols.22 We
have studied the catalytic application of GO-based nanocomposites
containing NPs, such as Pd NPs-GO/P123,23 SE-Pd NPs/rGO,24 and Pd NPs-GO,25 as heterogeneous and recyclable green catalysts
in organic transformations. However, the combination of open metal
site MOFs (OMS-MOFs) with GO as a selective catalyst for aerobic oxidation
of alcohols to carbonyls with TEMPO has not been explored. On the
other hand, magnetic separation based on Fe3O4 NPs is widely utilized in catalytic application due to its economic
earth abundance, convenience, and high efficiency.26−28

Motivated
by the above considerations, herein, we describe a highly
economic method for the fabrication of a ternary nanocomposite with
Fe3O4 NPs anchored on the open-metal site of
a GO-sheet-supported Cu(BDC) composite (Fe3O4/Cu-BDC/GO). Notably, the synergistic effect among the components
(GO sheets, Fe3O4 NPs, Cu-MOF, and TEMPO radical)
has been studied during the selective oxidation of alcohols to their
corresponding carbonyl compounds in the presence of molecular oxygen.
Systematical studies on the catalytic activity of the proposed nanocomposite
and TEMPO radicals toward a broad range of alcohols provided insights
into the catalytic mechanism, particularly unraveling the synergistic
effect between the nanocomposite components. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first example of the ternary nanocomposite exhibiting
enhanced catalytic activity for aerobic oxidation of alcohols in the
presence of TEMPO radicals boosted by copper centers from Cu-MOF.

2 Results and Discussion
In a typical synthesis method,
GO sheets were prepared by exfoliation
of commercial graphite via dilution and sonication in aqueous media.
The magnetic NPs and Cu-MOF were grown simultaneously on GO sheets
via a solvothermal method (Scheme 1). The salient advantages of the proposed catalyst
are demonstrated in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes
under base-free conditions.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Strategy for the Assembly
of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis is utilized to explore
the chemical structure of ternary nanocomposites (Figure 1). The spectra of CuBDC and
those of the corresponding composite material exhibit high similarity.
Asymmetric stretching is detected at wavenumbers of 1503–1666
cm–1 for the carboxylate groups in terephthalic
acid and 1396 and 1623 cm–1 for the carboxylate
groups in 1,4-benzene dicarboxylate (H2BDC). A variation
of transmittance peaks of Fe3O4, CuBDC, and
Fe3O4/OMS-CuBDC/GO in a region of 2500–3800
cm–1 indicates the effect of the introduction of
GO on the hybrid material.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra ternary nanocomposite (blue),
CuBDC (red), GO (green),
and Fe3O4 NPs (brown).

The surficial chemical analysis is carried out using X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) (Figure 2). The characteristic peaks of Fe 2p, O 1s, Cu 2p, C 1s, and N 1s
in the spectrum demonstrate the presence of Fe3O4, CuBDC, and GO sheets in Fe3O4/OMS-CuBDC/GO
(Figure 2a). Three
deconvoluted C 1s peaks at 339.3, 339.8, and 342.2 eV suggest that
sp2 electron orbital-bonded carbon in carboxylate (C=C/C–C),
(N–C=O) and (O–C=O) is derived from terephthalic
acid for CuBDC (Figure 2b).29 The deconvoluted O 1s spectra (Figure 2c) suggest C=O
(576.4 eV) and C–OH (586.7 eV) bonds. A single peak at 392.1
eV in the N 1s spectrum indicates a characteristic value of N–C
originating from the solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) coordination
in CuBDC (Figure 2d).
Deconvoluted Fe 2p shows the binding energies at 610.4 (2p3/2) and 664.5 eV (2p1/2) in Fe3O4 NPs
(Figure 2e). The binding
energy for Cu(II) is 918.6 eV, and the shift toward higher energy
suggests a charge transfer from Cu(II) to organic ligands (Figure 2f).30 Thus, these analyses confirm a successful decoration of
Fe3O4 NPs and Cu-BDC MOF on GO sheets.

(b) C 1s; (c) O 1s; (d) N 1s; (e) Fe 2p; and (f) Cu 2p.

The crystalline structure of the prepared Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO was determined by an X-ray powder diffractometer
as shown
in Figure 3. The diffraction
patterns of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO are similar to those
observed for CuBDC31 and Fe3O4 NPs,32 indicating the structural
assemblies of Cu-MOF and magnetic NPs. Although GO sheets cannot be
observed in TEM images due to their monolayer form, all other peaks
are consistent with the standard pattern of the parent materials.33,34

pattern of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO nanocomposite.

The texture of the obtained ternary nanocomposite
is investigated
via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM; Figure 4). A cubic, layered morphology indicates a successful
formation of the OMS-CuBDC crystal35 in
ternary nanocomposite (Figure 4b); Fe3O4 NPs are heterogeneously dispersed
on the Cu-MOF surface as displayed in FE-SEM images. It should be
noticed that the particle size of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO
composite is smaller than that of CuBDC without Fe3O4 NPs, which can be attributed to the Fe3O4 NPs acting as crystallization modulators and/or seeding materials
for the formation of Cu-MOF crystals.36−38 The TEM analysis of
the ternary nanocomposite clearly demonstrates the aggregated Fe3O4 particles. The result suggests that Fe3O4 particles remained essentially unchanged even after
the conversion and integration process in CuBDC MOF.

shows
a dark-field scanning TEM (STEM) micrograph of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO, indicating a magnetic compound, MOF, and GO sheets.
STEM energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images in Figure 5b proved the presence of C,
O, Fe, and Cu elements in the ternary nanocomposite structure. In
addition, the EDX mapping of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO
is depicted in Figure 5c, which affirms the high purity and incorporation of each component.

image, (b) STEM-EDX elemental mapping, and (c) EDX spectrum
of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO.

The superparamagnetic profile of the pure Fe3O4 and Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO samples are measured by
a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM; Figure 6). The saturation magnetization value for
ternary nanocomposite is 17.1 emu g–1, which is
lower than that of Fe3O4 NPs (63.8 emu g–1) due to the introduction of Cu-MOF and GO sheets;
unlike CuBDC and GO, ternary nanocomposite illustrates small hysteresis
loops, suggesting the incorporation of Fe3O4.39,40 Thus, the ternary nanocomposite can be easily
separated using an external magnet after the aerobic oxidation of
alcohols.

and Fe3O4 (black) at room temperature.

An unexpected application of the ternary nanocomposite
for the
aerobic selective oxidation of alcohols under base-free conditions
is studied. The optimization of experimental conditions is explored
via oxidation of benzyl alcohol, as a model compound, with a TEMPO
radical initiator where no reaction is observed in the absence of
catalyst or TEMPO. Furthermore, a negligible conversion is attained
for benzaldehyde in the absence of an O2 oxidant. Regarding
the solvent effect, anaerobic oxidation of alcohols occurs in diverse
solvents, namely, CH3CN, EtOH, MeOH, H2O, and
toluene; the highest conversion (>98%; Figure 7a) is achieved using CH3CN. Then,
a quick survey of bases revealed that the conversion of alcohol without
any base is similar to that using K2CO3, which
indicates a highly efficient catalytic system (Figure 7b). Because the reactions at room temperature
are equally effective and important from an energy consumption perspective,
the studies are continued under ambient conditions (Figure 7c,d).

Figure 7 Effects of (a) solvent,
(b) base, (c) temperature, and (d) kinetic
on the aerobic oxidation of alcohols.

To investigate the catalytic activity of ternary nanocomposite,
a series of controlled experiments are carried out (Figure 8a). Bare CuBDC, Fe3O4 NPs, and GO sheets results in a low product yield (<60%)
under optimized conditions. When Fe3O4 NPs anchored
on GO-sheet-supported CuBDC surface are deployed, they deliver benzaldehyde
with more than 98% yield after 8 h, demonstrating that the synergetic
effect of Fe3O4 NPs and GO sheets in Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO plays a significant role. The highly
improved catalytic activity is also comparable to that of a homogeneous
catalyst, and Cu(NO3)2 shows the highest conversion
(>75%, Figure 8b).
Notably, Cu(NO3)2, used for preparing OMS-CuBDC,
exhibits higher catalytic activity than that of OMS-CuBDC but lower
than that of Fe3O4/OMS-CuBDC/GO.

Figure 8 Effect of (a) heterogeneous
and (b) homogeneous catalysts on the
reaction proceeding in optimized conditions.

To verify the synergetic effect of Fe3O4 NPs
and GO sheets on the stabilization of active Cu(II) interface in OMS-CuBDC
framework, the oxidation of benzyl alcohol is explored. After each
reaction cycle, the proposed catalyst is separated by a magnet and
dried at 120 °C in vacuum, followed by reuse under the same reaction
conditions. Figure 9 shows that Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO remains substantially
activity over seven cycles, with a conversion of 93.5% after the seventh
cycle. The FE-SEM image of the catalyst after seven runs shows an
intact structure, suggesting that the proposed nanocomposite is quite
stable under optimized conditions (Figure 9b). After eight runs, the conversion of benzyl
alcohol decreases from 91.5% (the seventh cycle) to 57.2% (the eighth
cycle), with a selectivity of benzaldehyde over 94%.

Figure 9 (a) Durability of the
ternary catalyst in seven consecutive runs.
(b) FE-SEM image of the catalyst after seven recycling cycles.

A controlled leaching experiment is performed to
reach a deeper
understanding of the heterogeneous nature of the proposed catalyst.
The ICP-AES analysis of the aerobic oxidation of alcohols indicates
negligible copper leaching (detection limit 2.1–3.5 ppm). Hot
filtration test (Figure 10) of the reaction suspension to remove the insoluble Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO also led to the inhibition of homogeneous
reaction. However, analysis of the mixture reaction illustrates that,
after the removal of OMS-CuBDC catalyst, the yield of benzaldehyde
increases from 15 to 37%, indicating some copper leaching in the catalytic
reaction. The results obtained from the leaching test suggest that
the GO sheets and Fe3O4 NPs protect the heterogeneous
catalyst from leaching to a certain degree as well as provide mass-transfer
channels during the oxidation of alcohol reaction.

Figure 10 Kinetic of the reaction
and the result of hot filtration test.

The subtract scope for the catalyst, Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO,
with TEMPO as a co-catalyst is explored for the oxidation
of alcohols under the optimized condition, and the results are summarized
in Table 1. Primary
benzylic alcohols (entries 1–9), either with an electron-withdrawing
or an electron-donating substituent, afforded good conversion and
excellent selectivity, except para- and meta-nitrobenzyl alcohols
(entries 5 and 8), which resulted in 84 and 81% conversions, respectively.
Moreover, the oxidation of secondary aliphatic and aromatic alcohols
(entries 10–12) and the heteroatom-substituted aromatic alcohols
(entries 6 and 7) gave moderate yields, which was probably due to
the steric interaction.

A comparative oxidative efficiency and catalytic activity
of our
catalyst, Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO, with several noble
metals and noble transition metal (NTM) catalysts are presented in Table 2; the proposed catalyst
exhibits higher conversion ratio and selectivity compared to those
of other documented systems, with the exception of Pd@MgO41 and Au polystyrene.42 Notably, the better results are obtained using earth-abundant materials
in our case.

Table 2 Summary of Reaction Conditions and
Results for Oxidation of Alcohols in the Presence of Oxygen Molecular41−57
The chemoselectivity
and homoselectivity are also examined. Deploying
an equimolar mixture of cyclohexane and benzyl alcohol with TEMPO
in the presence of molecular oxygen under optimized conditions is
used for the chemoselectivity study (Scheme 2a). An analysis of the mixture after 8 h
indicates that the yield of benzaldehyde is 82% (1a), whereas cyclohexanone
is isolated in 11% yield (1b), with benzoic acid present only in trace
amount (1c). The oxidation of 1,4-bezenedimethanol in optimized conditions
is selected for the test of homoselectivity of this method (Scheme 2b); both alcoholic
groups are oxidized and terephthalic dialdehyde (2a) is produced in
lower yield (39%). By doubling the amount of all reactants, the yield
of (2a) reaches a higher value of 76%, whereas the formation of 4-hydroxymethyl
benzaldehyde (2b) is negligible, suggesting this method is not appropriate
for the homoselective aerobic oxidation of bifunctional alcohols.

Scheme 2 Chemoselectivity and Homoselectivity of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO in Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols
Based on the aforementioned observations and the previously described
mechanistic studies on the oxidation of alcohols, the plausible mechanism
is depicted in Scheme 3, wherein copper-active sites in structure CuBDC and TEMPOH afford
CuII-OH species and TEMPO•.58 This reaction sequence explains why strong bases,
such as KOtBu or DBU, often deployed in such reactions,
are not required when copper is used as a catalyst source; the base
(MOF-CuII-OH) is generated upon reduction of O2.59−61 The oxidation of alcohol proceeds via the formation of a pre-equilibrium
of copper alkoxide species, followed by the transfer of H2 atom to TEMPO•.

Scheme 3 Possible Oxidation
Mechanism for Alcohols Using Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO
3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials and Instruments
Benzene
1,4-dicarboxylate (H2BDC), Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, and other compounds and reagents were obtained
commercially from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck (Germany), and Fluka (Switzerland),
respectively. The ternary nanocomposite was characterized using powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Philips-PW 1800 diffractometer).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded with a Hitachi
S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and elemental mapping images were obtained using
a JEOL JEM-2100F analytical electron microscope with an accelerating
voltage of 200 kV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were
obtained using a Shimadzu IR-640 spectrometer.

3.2 Synthesis
of Fe3O4 NPs
The magnetic NPs were
prepared according to the literature with
some modifications.62 In a typical preparation,
1.35 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 3.60 g of NaOAc
were dissolved in 50 mL of ethylene glycol (EG), followed by stirring
for 2 h with a magnetic bar. The obtained homogeneous grade yellow
solution was treated in a Teflon-lined autoclave in an oven at 473
K for 8 h. Then, the Teflon-lined autoclave was cooled slowly at a
rate 1 °C min–1 to ambient temperature. The
obtained black precipitation was washed with ethanol and deionized
water (DI) water for three times and then dried at 70 °C overnight.

3.3 Fabrication of OMS-CuBDC
Cu(BDC)•nDMF was synthesized based on a previously
reported method with slight modifications.35,63 In a typical preparation, 1.812 g of copper nitrate trihydrate,
1.24 g of terephthalic acid, and 1 mmol of Et3N for deprotonate
terephthalic acid were dissolved in 150 mL of DMF. The obtained homogeneous
blue solution was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at
110 °C for 36 h. Thereafter, the blue precipitation was collected
by centrifugation and washed three times with DMF and methanol to
remove organic species trapped within pores. Finally, Cu(BDC)·nDMF was activated at 140 °C in a vacuum to obtain
open metal sites to afford a 69% yield of OMS-Cu(BDC) MOF.

3.4 Fabrication of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO
Fe3O4/OMS-Cu(BDC) was prepared
by a solvothermal method. GO was prepared by the oxidation of graphite
according to the Hummer method.64 A suspension
of 0.1 mg/mL GO in EG solvent was prepared via vigorous sonication
for 120 min under ambient conditions. Then, equimolar of copper nitrate
trihydrate (7.5 mmol, 1.812 g) and terephthalic acid (7.5 mmol, 1.245
g) were dissolved in 150 mL of DMF. The mixture was stirred for 30
min, followed by the introduction of 0.25 g of Fe3O4. The mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave
and heated in an oven at 110 °C for 36 h. Afterward, the Teflon-lined
autoclave was cooled slowly at a rate of 1 °C min–1 to room temperature; the ensuing green powder was filtered off,
washed several times with DMF and dichloromethane, and then dried
overnight at 393 K in vacuum. The wt % of copper in Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO measured with AAS was found to be 31.3%.

3.5 Catalytic Reaction
The selective
oxidation of alcohols was conducted in a 25 mL flask fitted with a
reflux condenser. Typically, certain amounts of catalyst, alcohol
(1 mmol), and TEMPO (0.75 mmol) were added to 4 mL of acetonitrile.
This system was purged two times with oxygen (O2) and then
sealed with an O2 balloon. The reaction mixture was heated
to the desired reaction temperature under constant stirring. After
completing the reaction, the catalysts were removed from the solution
with a simple magnet; the liquid organic products were analyzed by
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). After
each cycle of catalytic reaction, the catalysts were collected using
an external magnet and dried at 100 °C in a vacuum for subsequent
reuse.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
a novel ternary hybrid nanomaterial with a controllable
active copper(II) interface is fabricated via a facile method under
mild synthetic conditions. Magnetic nanoparticles with open metal
site CuBDC MOF were grown simultaneously on GO sheets. The active
copper in OMS-CuBDC frameworks and the synergistic interaction between
GO and Fe3O4 NPs make the hybrid nanocomposite
an excellent catalyst with high efficiency and reusability for the
aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. Therefore, the controllable
design of Fe3O4/CuBDC/GO structure using earth-abundant
materials may provide an innovative approach for the exploration of
highly active and stable heterogeneous catalysts for diverse catalytic
applications.
