We have used literature data on the
solubility of cyclooctasulfur
in a number of solvents to drive Abraham descriptors for cyclooctasulfur.
These can then be used in linear free-energy relationships that we
have already constructed to predict partition coefficients and solubilities
in a very large number of additional solvents. Cyclooctasulfur is
very hydrophobic, has zero hydrogen bond acidity and zero hydrogen
bond basicity, and dissolves best in nonpolar or only moderately polar
solvents. We have also obtained enthalpies of solvation of cyclooctasulfur
in solvents; again our linear free-energy relationships can be used
to predict enthalpies of solvation in further solvents.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The lithium/sulfur battery is a recent development. It has a high
theoretical capacity, and has aroused considerable interest.1,2 One concern is the solubility of sulfur in potential nonaqueous
electrolytes, and Zheng et al.3 have determined
the solubility of sulfur in a several candidate solvents. However,
the number of possible solvents is so large that it would be very
useful to have some methods of estimating the solubility of sulfur.
Jeschke and Johansson4 have used the conductor
like screening model for real solvents method of Klamt5 to calculate the solubility of sulfur in ten solvents,
but this method is very computer intensive and it would be of some
advantage to have a simpler method that could be used without recourse
to a specific computer software program.

We have developed a
method of assigning properties or “descriptors”
of molecules, based on linear free-energy relationships, LFERs. These
descriptors, together with equations for water–solvent partition
coefficients, that we have concurrently developed, can then be used
to estimate further water–solvent partition coefficients into
a very large number of solvents. Because water–solvent partition
coefficients can, for the most part, be regarded as the ratio of solubilities
in a solvent and in water, this provides an arithmetically very simple
way of estimating solubilities. Our aim is therefore to obtain descriptors
for sulfur and then to use these to estimate solubilities of sulfur
in a wide range of solvents.

The stable form of solid sulfur
at 298 K is orthorhombic α-sulfur6 and so any solubility at 298 K will be that of
α-sulfur. There are a number of configurations of sulfur that
can exist in solution. However, α-sulfur dissolves as cyclooctasulfur6 and so all of the data on solubilities that we
shall use refer to cyclooctasulfur of molecular weight 256.52. Some
literature data on solubilities are given in terms of cyclooctasulfur,
but other data may be in terms of wt %, etc. Where necessary, we have
converted solubilities given in various units to mol cyclooctasulfur
per dm–3 solution.

2 Methodology
The method we use makes use of two LFERs, eqs 1 and 2. In eq 1, SP is Ps, the water–solvent partition coefficient, and in eq 2, SP is Ks, the dimensionless gas to solvent partition coefficient. 1   2  The independent
variables, or descriptors,
in eqs 1 and 2, are properties of a neutral solute, in this case
cyclooctasulfur, as follows:7−12E is the solute excess molar refraction in cm3 mol–1/10, S is the solute dipolarity/polarizability, A is the overall solute hydrogen bond acidity, B is the overall solute hydrogen bond basicity, V is
McGowan’s characteristic molecular volume in cm3 mol–1/100,12 and L is the logarithm of the gas to hexadecane partition coefficient
at 298 K. The coefficients in eqs 1 and 2 are shown in Table 1 for partition from
water or from the gas phase to the various solvents that we shall
deal with.13−22 These are all dry solvents except for octan-1-ol where the solvent
is in equilibrium with water. We list this solvent as “wet”
octan-1-ol.

Use of eqs 1 and 2 for the determination of descriptors has been reviewed
several times.7−11 In brief, a set of simultaneous equations is set up using eqs 1 and 2 with known values of the dependent variable for a given compound.
The values of the independent variables, E, S, A, B, V, and L, are then obtained by using solution of the set of simultaneous
equations. Because we invariably have more equations than unknowns,
the set of equations is solved by trial-and-error, with the final
set of independent variables, or descriptors, taken as the set that
yields the smallest error of the fit. The “Solver” add-on
to the Microsoft Excel is a particularly convenient method to obtain
the trial-and-error solution.

3 Results and Discussion
The solubility data that we use are given in Table 2(3,6,23−30) as log Cs where Cs is the solubility of S8 in mol dm–3. These solubilities can be transformed into water–solvent
partition coefficients through eq 3, where Cw is the solubility
of S8 in water at 298 K. 3  Experimental determinations
of the solubility
of sulfur in water yield values of 3.01 and 2.63 × 10–8 mol S8 dm–3,31,32 so that from the average we take log Cw as −7.55 as the value to use in eq 3. A particularly useful physicochemical parameter
is Kw, the gas phase to water partition
coefficient at 298 K, because it can be used to convert all log Ps values into the corresponding gas phase to
solvent partition coefficient, Ks, through eq 4. 4  Kw itself can
be obtained from the gas phase concentration of sulfur at 298 K, Cg derived from the vapor pressure of solid sulfur
at 298 K and the aqueous solubility. If Cw and Cs are both in units of mol dm–3, then Kw is dimensionless. 5  We have fitted the data of Briske et al.33 on the vapor pressure, VP, of α-sulfur
to the Apelblat equation, eq 6, and find that the ln VP/mm Hg = −13.37, corresponding
to log Cg = −10.07 at 298.15
K. The corresponding enthalpy of sublimation of α-sulfur at
298.15 K was 100.1 kJ mol–1, essentially the same
as that found by Briske et al,33 99.9 kJ
mol–1. If log Cw is −7.55, as shown above, the value of log Cg leads to log Kw = 2.52 6  There is one set of data
on solubilities,
that of Wang et al.,30 in which solubilities
were recorded over a range of temperature. We fitted these to the
equivalent Apelblat equation and then obtained the enthalpy of solution
at 298 K. When combined with the enthalpy of sublimation, these yield
the enthalpy of solvation of cyclooctasulfur, that is, the enthalpy
change from the gas phase to solution, as shown in Table 3. We give results for all of
the solvents studied,30 although we have
equations on the lines of eqs 1 and 2 for ΔH(solv) for only four of the listed solvents,34−37 see Table 4.

We have solubilities in 18 solvents, as log Cs, and using log Cw as −7.55 we can convert all these into log Ps values through eq 3. These 18 log Ps values can be transformed into 18 log Ks values through eq 4, either using log Kw =
2.52 (obtained as above) or by allowing log Kw to float, that is to take log Kw as another unknown descriptor. We have two equations
in log Kw itself, see Table 1, and eight equations
in ΔH(solv), making a set of no less than 46
simultaneous equations, from which to deduce the cyclooctasulfur descriptors.
In the case of ΔH(solv), we regressed ΔH(solv)/100 in order that the dependent variables should
be of a similar magnitude to those of log Ps. We can sometimes estimate the E-descriptor
from known values for related compounds but that is not possible in
this case. However, we can calculate that V = 1.3080
by McGwan’s method,12 and so we
are left with six unknown descriptors (E, S, A, B, L, and log Kw) to obtain from the 46 simultaneous equations.
The system is greatly over specified, and we use a trial-and-error
procedure to yield values for the descriptors that minimizes the error
in observed and calculated dependent variables. We obtained a set
of descriptors for cyclooctasulfur as E = 1.92, S = 0.82, A =0.00, B = 0.00, L = 7.127, V = 1.3080, and log Kw = 1.10 with an overall standard deviation
(SD), between the observed and calculated dependent variables of 0.205
log units. These descriptors include log Kw = 1.10 instead of the 2.52 log units that we calculated
from the water solubility and the vapor concentration. However, this
calculated value is the difference between two very large quantities
and so is subject to considerable error. If we fix log Kw as 2.52 and repeat the solution of the simultaneous
equations, the SD rises to 0.224 log units, and so we prefer our original
set of descriptors with log Kw =
1.10. These descriptors show that cyclooctasulfur is not very polar
and has neither hydrogen bond acidity nor hydrogen bond basicity.
The latter observation may appear surprising, but sulfur compounds
in general have a low hydrogen bond basicity; hydrogen sulfide has B = 0.08, for example. The small dipolarity and lack of hydrogen
bond acidity and basicity result in cyclooctasulfur being considerably
hydrophobic. The water–octanol partition coefficient, as log Poct, is often taken as a measure of hydrophobicity,
and in Table 5 we compare
our calculated values of log Poct, 5.31, with those for other hydrophobic solutes.38 It can be seen that cyclooctasulfur can be classed as extremely
hydrophobic.

Our obtained descriptors can now be used to calculate
values of
log Ps through the coefficients
for eq 1 given in Table 1. These can simply
be converted into solubilities, as log Cs, using log Cw = −7.75,
see eq 3. The calculated
solubilities are in Table 2. There are quite substantial differences in the observed
solubilities where multiple determinations are given, and so we only
regard differences of more than about 0.3 log units between calculated
and observed solubilities as significant. These differences include
that for carbon disulfide (0.96 log units), which is so large that
we suggest there may be solvate formation in this solvent. Other notable
differences are for solubilities in acetonitrile and aniline. The
observed solubility in acetonitrile seems quite out-of-line in comparison
with solubilities in other polar aprotic solvents and could be in
error. Once the descriptors for cyclooctasulfur are available, no
more than simple arithmetic is necessary to predict values of the
water–solvent partition coefficient and then solubilities in
a very large number of solvents, for which we have equation on the
line of eq 1. As expected
from the hydrophobicity of cyclooctasulfur, it is not very soluble
in alcohols or in dipolar aprotic solvents but is more soluble in
aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons. Other solvents, in which cyclooctasulfur
is more soluble, are aliphatic esters and aliphatic ethers, especially
cyclic ethers, and a number of other not very polar solvents, such
as cyclohexanone and N-methylpyrrolidinone, see Table 6. We also have equations
for enthalpy of solvation in additional solvents to those in Table 4, and so enthalpies
of solvation can be predicted for these extra solvents.

[OE3Am]+[Tf2N]−, and 1-butyl-1-methylmorpholinium tricyanomethanide [BMMorp]+[C(CN)3]−.

Because of its high hydrophobicity
it seemed unlikely that cyclooctasulfur
would easily be soluble in solvents, such as ionic liquids. We have
equations for partition into a large number of ionic liquids, and
coefficients in eq 1 are
given in Table 6 for
a few ionic liquids that we have studied recently.39 The obtained values of log Ps for cyclooctasulfur can be calculated and then transformed
into solubilities. Values of log Cs are given in Table 6 and indicate that for the five ionic liquids, solubilities are very
low, even lower that in the dipolar aprotic liquids, listed in Table 2. This example shows
again how simple it is to estimate solubilities for cyclooctasulfur
using the equations that we have assembled.
