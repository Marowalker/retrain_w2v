Heterojunction catalysts
are attracting attention in the field
of photocatalytic hydrogen generation for their effective light utilization
and charge separation personalities. In this work, we report a simple
and low-cost two-step solvothermal method for synthesizing Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction catalysts with an octahedral
morphology and a mean particle size of about 30 nm. It is found that
the introduction of Cu2O astonishingly enhances the photocatalytic
performance of TiO2. Under the condition of methanol acting
as a sacrificial agent, the heterojunction with 0.19% Cu species shows
an optimal hydrogen generation rate of 24.83 mmol g–1 h–1, which is nearly 3 orders of magnitude higher
than that of the pristine TiO2 catalyst.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Energy
and environment are important to the progress and future
of humanity. The continuous increase of world population together
with the constant expansion of modern industry speeds up the existing
energy consumption. Also, traditional energy utilization has little
consideration on environment conservation and energy sustainability,
which bring about imperious energy crisis and serious environmental
issues.1−3 Development of renewable clean energy is put forward
for solving these problems at this crucial moment. Hydrogen, as a
renewable and clean energy with unique advantages of high energy density
and outstanding combustion efficiency, has been an important renewable
clean energy and even been considered as the most hopeful energy in
the 21st century.4−7 Up to date, H2 can be produced by steam reforming of
natural gas, electrolysis of water, photoelectrochemical or photocatalytic
water splitting, and biological/microbial approaches. Among these
methods, photocatalytic water splitting into H2 and O2 using solar energy and semiconductor photocatalysts has been
considered as the most promising strategy to address the environment
conservation and energy sustainability simultaneously.8−11

The overall water-splitting reaction requires a photocatalyst
owning
a more minus conduction band than H+/H2 reduction
potential and a more positive valence band than O2/H2O oxidation potential. Representative photocatalysts are TiO2, ZrO2, KTaO3, SrTiO3, WO3, ZnS, CdS, MoS2, ZnO, SnO2, In2O3, C3N4, SrTiO3, BiVO4, Bi2MoO6, K4Nb6O17, and so on.10,12−14 Unfortunately, most of these materials are not ideal candidates
for water splitting because of their wide band gap, rapid recombination
of photogenerated electron/hole pairs, or inferior photocorrosion
resistance. For example, TiO2, as one of the most prominent
photocatalysts for its high chemical stability and high photocatalytic
activity under UV light, is also subject to its poor absorption of
visible light and noticeable recombination of photogenerated carriers.3,15−17 Various strategies have been proposed to solve these
problems, for instance, by doping, metal loading, and/or constructing
heterojunction.18−21 Constructing heterojunctions by introduction of co-catalysts has
been proved to be one of the most promising ways to improve the solar-to-chemical
energy conversion (and chemical stability) of TiO2 and
many other wide band gap (or unstable) semiconductors.22−27 A good co-catalyst for constructing heterojunction should meet the
following basic conditions: (i) small band gap (for the harvest of
visible light); (ii) electron injection should be fast and efficient;
and (iii) nontoxic, lowcost, and chemically stable. Besides, the energy
position of the conduction band of TiO2 is very close to
the H+/H2 reduction potential.28−31 Therefore, the cocatalyst is generally required to possess a more
negative conduction band than that of TiO2 for constructing
a TiO2-based heterojunction. Cu2O is a semiconductor
that meets all these requirements, and therefore the Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction has attracted much attention.32−37 The Cu species usually appeared in three forms: metal Cu, oxidation
state CuI and CuII, which could exhibit concurrently
in the composite and difficult to distinguish. Especially, the quantities
were small in the composite. So far, little routes are available for
fabricating such Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts that can
both load with rare content of Cu and get pure Cu species of Cu2O.38−40

Herein, we successfully prepared the Cu2O/TiO2 catalyst with an octahedral structure and
a nanoscaled size. The
Cu species existing in the catalyst turned out to be Cu2O, and its content is no more than 1%. Furthermore, the composite
catalyst exhibits superior photocatalytic performance when applied
to generate hydrogen from a methanol solution. Along with the bonus
of a high surface to volume, the Cu2O/TiO2 catalyst
provides additional benefits of reuse to reduce the use cost sharply
in the industrial-scale production.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Surface Morphology
Appropriate solvothermal
reaction can convert protonated titanate and cupric acetate into titanium
oxide and cuprous oxide nanoparticles, respectively. It is found that
the morphology of the products was independent on the Cu/Ti ratio
in this study. Figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the representative sample T-3. The product
consisted mainly of octahedron nanoparticles with a mean size of about
30 nm. On the basis of the knowledge of crystallography, these octahedron
nanoparticles can be referred to anatase TiO2, and the
eight exposed facets can be determined to be {101}. According to the
Wulff construction, the octahedron structure enclosed by {101} facets
is the thermodynamic equilibrium shape of anatase crystals.41 The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the
octahedron nanoparticles is displayed in Figure 1c and the corresponding fast Fourier transform
(FFT) diffraction pattern is presented in Figure 1d. At least three sets of lattice fringes
with spacings of 4.70, 3.51, 3.48, and 2.40 Å were observed,
which correspond to (004), (101), (−101), and (103) planes
of the anatase phase, respectively. Besides, as shown in Figure 1a,b, the nanoparticles
were highly dispersed, which promised a high specific surface area.
According to the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm (Figure S1), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of sample T-3 was as high as 101 m2/g.

image and (b) TEM image, (c) HRTEM image, and (d) corresponding
FFT diffraction pattern of the selected area in (c) of catalyst T-3.

2.2 Crystalline
Structure
Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalysts.
For all the samples, only anatase TiO2 (JCPDS card no.
21-1272) was observed. It is found that the peak position of the anatase
phase remained unchanged with the increasing copper content, which
excluded the possibility of copper doping in the TiO2 lattice
(or the doping concentration was very low). The difficult substitution
of Ti by Cu can be attributed to their large mismatching of the valence
state and ionic radius (0.605 Å for Ti4+, 0.73 Å
for Cu2+, and 0.77 Å for Cu+). Furthermore,
diffraction peaks of Cu2O and any other copper species
were not observed in all the Cu2O/TiO2 samples,
which may be due to the low content and the poor crystallinity of
copper species because the inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP–OES) (Table 1) and scanning TEM–energy dispersed X-ray spectroscopy
(STEM–EDS) (Figures S2 and S3) characterization
confirm the presence of Cu. After calcining in argon atmosphere at
500 °C for 2 h, characteristic diffraction peaks of Cu2O were detected in T-6 with a copper content of about 4.4%, as shown
in Figure S4. The emergence of Cu2O diffraction peaks after calcination in an inert gas demonstrated
the existence of copper species, and copper existed in the form of
Cu2O.

The structural property of the samples was further
examined by
Raman spectra. Anatase TiO2 is tetragonal and belongs to
the space group (D4h19 = I41/amd), according to the factor group analysis, the
fifteen optical modes have the irreducible representation Γopt = A1g (R) + 2B1g (R) + 3Eg (R) + B2u (ia) + A2u (IR) + 2Eu (IR).42 As shown in Figure 3, the Raman peaks appeared
at 144, 196, 396, 517, and 638 cm–1 can be definitely
assigned to Eg(1), Eg(2), B1g(1),
A1g + B1g(2), and Eg(3) modes of
the anatase phase, respectively. Shift of the Raman peak was not detected,
which further demonstrates that there was no doped copper in the TiO2 lattice.

Figure 3 Raman spectra for the Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts.

For further understanding the
chemical environment of Ti and Cu,
X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) analysis was carried out. Figure 4 shows the Ti 2p
and Cu 2p spectra collected for the Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalysts. The corresponding peaks of the Ti 2p spin orbital
appeared at 458.6 and 464.3 eV for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively, suggesting the presence of Ti4+ in all Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalysts. The highly
symmetrical Ti 2p3/2 peak implied the absence of Ti3+, while its constant binding energy indicated the unchanged
chemical environment. Figure 4b shows the Cu 2p spectra. Binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 were found to be located at 932.7 and 952.5
eV, respectively, which can be assigned to Cu+. For Cu
species, the shake-up satellite peak located at about 940–945
eV is characteristic for Cu2+ because of its d9 configuration in the ground state, while the d shell of Cu+ is completely filled (d10), and thus there was no satellite
peak in the Cu 2p spectra for Cu2O.32,43 Therefore, the absence of the shake-up satellite peak excluded the
existence of Cu2+. On the basis of the analysis of the
XPS and XRD results, we can conclude that Cu species exist in the
form of Cu2O and there was no doped Cu atom in the TiO2 crystal lattice.

UV–vis reflectance spectra were measured and converted
from
reflectance to absorption by the Kubelka–Munk method.44,45 As shown in Figure 5a, additional visible-light absorption was induced and enhanced with
increasing Cu2O content, which can be attributed to the
absorption of Cu2O whose absorption band edge is 450–515
nm.46,47 The enhanced absorption of visible light
may be beneficial to improve the utilization efficiency of sunlight
during the photocatalytic water-splitting process and thereby improve
the photocatalytic performance. According to the band structure of
the Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction (Figure 5b), under the irradiation of
visible light, photogenerated electrons transfer from the conduction
band of Cu2O to that of TiO2 and then further
transfer to the surface-active sites for H+/H2 reduction reaction. Obviously, this heterojunction structure can
boost visible-light activity and reduce the recombination rate of
photogenerated carriers.

Figure 5 UV–vis absorption spectra (a) and the
energy band diagram
(b) for the Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts.

The photocatalytic activity of the samples was
investigated in
a methanol solution under Xe lamp irradiation (Figure 6) and visible light irradiation (Figure S5). Figure 6a shows the time-dependent hydrogen generation.
For all the samples, the amount of produced H2 increased
linearly with irradiation time. Figures 6b and S5b show
the dependence of photocatalytic activity on the Cu2O content.
It is found that the increase in copper loading (Cu/Ti ratio) results
in increasing the hydrogen production up to 0.19% (i.e., sample T-3),
beyond which a negative effect was dominated. The optimal photocatalytic
hydrogen generation rate under the Xe lamp irradiation over sample
T-3 was 24.83 mmol g–1 h–1, which
was about 830 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.03
mmol g–1 h–1). Similarly, the
photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity under visible light (λ
> 420 nm) irradiation over sample T-3 was also optimized by enhancing
the hydrogen generation rate 17 times compared to pristine TiO2. A contrast was made to reveal the excellent performance
for the Cu2O/TiO2 octahedron compared with other
works as shown in Table S1. The improved
reactivity for the Cu2O-loaded TiO2 photocatalysts
can be attributed to both the enhancement of visible light absorption
and the formation of the Cu2O/TiO2 heterostructure.
As described above, the introduction of Cu2O with a narrow
band gap enhances the light absorption of TiO2 (Figure 5a), which may induce
visible-light photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, while Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor
whose conduction band is more negative than that of TiO2. The contact of TiO2 and Cu2O nanoparticles
constructs a p–n junction. Driven by the built-in electric
field, the photogenerated electrons migrate from Cu2O to
TiO2, while holes migrate in the opposite direction, decreasing
the bulk recombination probability of photogenerated carriers. The
electrons further migrate to the TiO2 crystal surfaces
and react with water to generate H2, while the holes are
consumed by the sacrificial agent. Obviously, the formation of heterojunction
can greatly facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers and
improve the photocatalytic performance. Besides, the catalyst T-3
was evaluated ten cycles of reuse in methanol solution for H2 production under Xe lamp irradiation (Figure S6) and the photocatalytic activity did not decrease obviously.
The used catalysts were annealed and characterized by XRD analysis
as shown in Figure S7, and no observable
change in the structure was detected. These observations indicated
the high chemical stability of the photocatalysts.

a methanol solution over pristine TiO2 and Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts. Dependence

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully
synthesized nano-sized Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction
catalysts with outstanding
photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance from water splitting
in the presence of the methanol sacrificial agent. The nano-sized
Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction catalysts have an octahedral
morphology. It is found that the presence of Cu2O can enhance
the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 by broadening the
light absorption from the ultraviolet region to about 515 nm. The
catalysts with 1.9% optimum copper content displays the highest hydrogen
yield activity. The corresponding hydrogen generation rate from methanol
solution is 24.83 mmol g–1 h–1, which is nearly 3 orders of magnitude better than that of the pristine
TiO2. This work has demonstrated a simple and facile method
to synthesize environment-friendly Cu2O/TiO2 heterojunction catalysts, which offers useful guidance for developing
other transition-metal oxide composited with TiO2 photocatalysts
using in energy conversion fields.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Catalysts Preparation
A protonated
titanate nanotube was used as the precursor for the synthesis of Cu2O/TiO2 heterogeneous photocatalysts. The H2Ti3O7 nanotube was prepared through
a hydrothermal reaction procedure. In a typical process, 5 g of Degussa
P25 was dispersed into 80 mL of 8 mol/L NaOH solution and magnetically
stirred for 1 h. The mixture was transferred into a 100 mL autoclave
and then heated at 180 °C for 10 h. After the hydrothermal reaction,
the precipitate was collected and washed with diluted HNO3 solution (pH = 4) repeatedly until pH = 4, followed by washing with
distilled water to neutral. The as-obtained protonated titanate product
was further washed with absolute ethanol for several times and subsequently
dried overnight at 60 °C in air.

A series of Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by the alcohol-thermal
method, cupric acetate monohydrate was dissolved into absolute ethanol
to prepare 0.01 mol/L and 0.1 mol/L Cu(Ac)2 solution, and
5 g of H2Ti3O7 and a certain amount
of 0.01 or 0.1 mol/L Cu(Ac)2 solution (0–65 mL)
was added into ethanol and then magnetically stirred for 1 h. The
mixture was transferred into a 100 mL autoclave for alcohol-thermal
reaction under 150 °C for 20 h. The resulting precipitate was
washed by water and alcohol repeatedly and dried overnight at 60 °C
in air. The obtained Cu2O/TiO2 catalysts with
different copper contents were named as T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4, and
T-5, as shown in Table 1.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
The crystal
structure of the Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst was
characterized by powder XRD on Rigaku MiniFlex 600 (40 kV, 30 mA)
with a radiation source of Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å).
The data were collected in the range of 10°–80° at
a scanning rate of 0.5°/min. The morphology of the catalyst was
observed by field emission SEM using a Hitachi SU8010 with an applied
voltage of 15 kV and TEM. The surface species analysis was characterized
by XPS using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi electron spectrometer with
a radiation source of monochromic Al Kα radiation and C 1s peak
at 284.8 eV as internal standard. The Cu concentration was determined
using ICP–OES (Ultima-2 ICP–OES analyzer, JY, France)
and STEM–EDS. UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded
on a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, USA). Raman spectra
were collected in the range of 100–900 cm–1 from a LabRAM HR instrument (Horiba Jobin-Yvon, France) using a
532 nm laser as the light source. The BET surface area of the catalyst
was determined by N2 adsorption using an ASAP-2020 surface
area analyzer.

4.3 Photocatalytic Activity
Testing
In
a typical procedure, 0.1 g of the Cu2O/TiO2 photocatalyst
was dispersed in 100 mL 10 vol % aqueous methanol solution in a quarts
reactor. The reactor was then equipped on an online photocatalytic
activity evaluation system (CEL-SPH2N, CEAULight, China). With the
existing of a low-temperature thermostat bath keeping the temperature
of the reactor at 5 °C during the photocatalytic reaction, the
aqueous methanol solution and catalyst would not be pumped as the
airstream when the air in the system was removed by a pump and the
yielded hydrogen was sampled during the entire photocatalytic process.
The photocatalytic reaction began under the irradiation of a 300 W
xenon lamp with or without a band pass filter (λ > 420 nm)
accompanied
with hydrogen yielded from the catalyst surface and detected by an
appendant online chromatography.
