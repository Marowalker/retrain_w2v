Polyaniline-decorated ZIF-8 nanoparticles
(nPANI@nZIF-8) were easily
synthesized and employed as a multifunctional system for the delivery
of the antitumor drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Because of the storage
ability of the network ZIF-8, 68% of the total amount of the 5-FU
drug was released at pH 5.2. The system exhibits absorption in the
near-infrared (NIR) region and can be used in the photothermal therapy
owing to the presence of nPANI, which has a strong NIR uptake. This
absorption causes local hyperthermia by aiding in the diffusion of
the drug molecules contained by the polymer into nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
achieving a greater release of the 5-FU drug, about 80% activated
by an NIR laser (λ = 980 nm). This hyperthermia reached about
70 °C (200 μL, 1 mg mL–1 nPANI@nZIF-8),
which was directly proportional to the concentration of the material.
Therefore, our work can aid in the construction of new chemo-photothermal
platforms that may be employed in cancer therapy.

1 Introduction
Multifunctional
systems have attracted a lot of attention and are
being developed to provide better and cheaper alternatives in the
treatment of cancer.1−5 A chemo-photothermal multifunctional system has achieved prominence
in recent years. This method consists of a nanomaterial as the carrier
for drug delivery and a nanomaterial that has photothermal conversion
efficiency.6−8

The photothermal therapy (PTT) uses materials
that absorb and convert
energy from near-infrared (NIR) light into thermal energy causing
localized hyperthermia.9 This therapy can
be used to treat tumors. The irradiation at the NIR frequency can
penetrate the tissues with sufficient intensity, as well as with spatial
accuracy. Soft tissues and blood are relatively transparent in the
700–1100 nm region. PTT has the advantage of being minimally
invasive, with a minimal damage to healthy tissues.10 Reports on the use of metals as photothermal agents are
already widespread in the literature, where metals are mainly combined
with other materials.11−14 However, these metals are of high cost and exhibit low photostability
under long-term laser irradiation.15 Polymers
are among the alternative materials in the use of PTT, particularly
polypyrrole16−18 and polyaniline (PANI).15,19,20 PANI has wide applications because of chemical
stability, low cost, and easy polymerization synthesis. It also exhibits
excellent dispersibility in water, high NIR photothermal conversion
efficiency, and low toxicity to living systems.15,21 For these reasons, PANI was chosen as the photothermic agent for
this work. Furthermore, nanostructured PANI (nPANI) exhibits a greater
surface area and higher interactions of the polymer with the medium.

The drug carrier nanomaterial must have a structure with large
surface area and high pore volume. The material usually employed for
this purpose is the mesoporous silicas.22−24

The other type
of material that has the same profile and is being
widely used as a drug carrier is the class of metal organic frameworks
(MOFs). MOFs are a coordination network with organic ligands containing
potential voids formed between a metal and an organic binder bonded
by the coordinate bonds, generally, in two or three dimensions.25−27

Previously, our group has used the MOF ZIF-8 for the incorporation
of the drug doxorubicin (DOX; a load 0.049 g of DOX/g dehydrated ZIF-8).
DOX was released in a progressive manner with 66% of the drug released
after 30 days.28 Another work concerned
the use of molecular docking to confirm the utility of the MOF [Zn(BDC)(H2O)2]n in the loading
of some drugs. The procedure was able to distinguish between the bad
(gentamicin) and good guest (ibuprofen, methylene blue, and amoxicillin)
drug candidates for immobilization in the [Zn(BDC)(H2O)2]n framework, validated via experimental
measurements.29

In medicine, studies
have explored the application of MOFs in a
nanometric scale (nMOFs) to enhance the interaction with cancerous
cells because of smaller particle size.30 Some materials have already been incorporated in the nMOFs as, for
example, photosensitizers, contrast agents, magnetic materials, luminescence
materials, and drugs. These materials demonstrated potential clinical
applications such as biomedical imaging, sensing, photodynamic therapy
(PDT), and drug delivery in cancer therapy.2,6,8,18 The nMOF used
in this work was part of the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)
group. ZIF-8 has the Zn metal coordinated by the 2-methyl imidazole
linker. It exhibits chemical and thermal stabilities, harmony and
high pore availability, high cubic crystalline symmetry, relatively
low density, large surface area, and excellent water stability.31−34

The ZIF-8 nanoparticles (nZIF-8) have already been widely
employed
in cancer therapy as the carrier in chemo-photothermal multifunctional
systems.

Tian et al. produced two chemo-photothermal multifunctional
systems
involving nZIF-8. The first work synthesized ZIF-8 with graphene oxide
(GO) nanocrystals with the encapsulation of fluorescein simultaneously.
A controlled release of fluorescein by the action of pH (98% at pH
= 4.5) was obtained. An 808 nm, 2.5 W cm–2, NIR
laser was used for 3 min on the ZIF-8/GO material, and the temperature
of the nanocrystals was raised from 30 to 46.5 °C. There were
also significant decreases in the cell viability (40 and 21%) when
the cells were cultured with fluorescein-ZIF-8/GO, 50 and 100 μg/mL,
respectively, for 8 h and then irradiated.4 In the second work, nZIF-8 was proposed as a DOX drug nanocarrier
and the embedded graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as local photothermal
seeds, exhibiting a pH-responsive DOX release behavior (80% release
in the pH 4.5). The DOX-ZIF-8/GQD suspension (5 mg mL–1) was irradiated with an 808 nm laser at a power of 2.0 W cm–2 for 10 min and resulted in an increase from 30 to
49.5 °C. In vitro, the cells were treated for 8 h with the nanoparticles
and were followed by NIR irradiation at 808 nm for 3 min at 2.5 W
cm–2, with the cell viability decreasing by 18%.35

Yang et al. also produced a chemo-photothermal
multifunctional
system involving nZIF-8. They reported on a new nanocomposite based
on ZIF-8, with Pd–Au nanoparticles and the DOX drug encapsulated.2 At pH = 4, this achieved a 65.2% of DOX release
within 600 min. The sample DOX/Pd@Au@ZIF-8 (0.0375 mg mL–1) after irradiation with an NIR laser treatment of 780 nm (2.1 W
cm–2) for 10 min achieved a gradual increase of
temperature (∼Δ17 °C). The cells pretreated with
DOX/Pd@Au@ZIF-8 (80 μg/mL) for 24 h and then irradiated by the
NIR laser for 10 min decreased the viability of cancer cells by 11%.

Other types of multifunctional systems involving nZIF-8 have been
reported. Yang and collaborators combined PTT and PDT. The temperature
of HeLa cells incubated with Fe3O4/ZIF-8-5mL-Au25 increased to about 60 °C after 10 min of irradiation,
and most of the cells incubated with Fe3O4/ZIF-8-Au25 after two types of stimuli (NIR light and magnet remote
control) were killed, presenting less than 15% cell viability.11 Chowdhuri et al. developed a multifunctional
nanomaterial, NaYF4:Yb3+ and Er3+, upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), encapsulated by nZIF-8, folic
acid functionalized (UCNPs@ZIF-8/FA), and loaded with the drug 5-FU.
The UCNP@ZIF-8/FA nanomaterial was used simultaneously as the carrier
and in cell images because of its luminescent properties. The drug
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was absorbed into the UCNP@ZIF-8/FA nanocomposites
(685 mg·g–1), and the pH-responsive drug release
was observed (82% at pH 5.5).36

In
this work, we report on the effective and rapid synthesis of
PANI-decorated ZIF-8 nanoparticles (nPANI@nZIF-8)/5-FU as a new multifunctional
and synergistic, pH-sensitive system for the chemo-photothermal treatment
of cancer.

2 Results and Discussions
Employment
of ZIF-8 as a support material for PANI nanoparticles
and a carrier for 5-FU antitumor, in the form of a single multifunctional
system, has provided a new strategy for chemo-photothermal cancer
therapy.

2.1 Synthesis and Optimization of nPANI@nZIF-8
The optimization of nPANI@nZIF-8 synthesis was successful as a
chemo-photothermal system. The synthesized nanomaterial followed the
adapted template described in the literature and reported in the experimental
procedure.37 Initially, 50 v/v % of the
PANI solution for the in situ synthesis of network nZIF-8 was used.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (see Figure S1), of the nanomaterial obtained, only showed the semicrystallinity
of the emeraldine PANI already reported in the literature (2θ
= 20° and 25°), exhibiting an excessive amount of PANI nanoparticles
which made the nZIF-8 lattice imperceptible.38−40

This
prominent amount of nPANI was confirmed by the N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements. Figure S2 exhibits the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
of ZIF-8 and nPANI@nZIF-8 samples at 77.4 K.

Pure samples of
nZIF-8 indicate that at low pressures (P/P0 < 0.03), there was a
large increase in the adsorbed N2 volume, indicating the
presence of micropores. A second increase can be observed at higher
pressures (P/P0 >
0.09),
which is characteristic of meso- and macropores. The surface area
value, calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
equation, and the total pore volume were 1658.49 m2 g –1 and 1.17 cm3 g–1, respectively,
close to the values reported in the literature for ZIF-8.41,42

The isotherm of nPANI@nZIF-8, synthetized with 50 v/v % of
the
PANI solution, did not show a significant amount of adsorbed nitrogen,
and its surface area could not be calculated, suggesting the obstruction
of the pores of nZIF-8 after interaction with nPANI.

In the
analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the
nanomaterial size was approximately 400 nm (see Figure S3). It can be assumed that there was an aggregation
of the nanoparticles of ZIF-8 and coating of PANI on these agglomerates,
indicating the excessive amount of nPANI.

Lower values were
then chosen for the PANI nanoparticle solution
(1, 5, and 10 v/v %) for each 100 mL of the total volume, and the
nanomaterials were synthesized. After this, the synthesis was performed
again with the analysis of pore volume and surface area (BET).

The nPANI@nZIF-8 nanomaterials showed type I isotherms, suggesting
that the modification of nZIF-8 with nPANI occurred mainly in the
mesopores and macropores (Figure 1). This hypothesis can be confirmed by the micropore
volume values of these materials, which did not undergo significant
changes after interaction with nPANI, whereas the volume of meso-
and macropores decreased dramatically. The obstruction of meso- and
macropores resulted in an increase in the microporosity of the materials
modified with nPANI. The microporosity of nZIF-8 was 48.7%; in the
ZIFs modified with PANI, the values varied from 87.3 to 96.5% (Table 1). Thus, functionalization
occurred mainly in the larger pores (meso- and macropores) because
the diffusion of large molecules in these pores can occur more easily
than in the smaller ones (micropores).

and nPANI@nZIF-8 with 1 mL of nPANI (green), 5 mL of nPANI (blue),

e Microporosity obtained through the
total volumes of pores and micropores.

For a greater chemotherapeutic and photothermal effect,
sufficient
porosity on the carrier material is necessary, as well as boosted
hyperthermia of the photothermal agent. Given this, we chose to use
5 mL (0.5 mg mL–1) of the volume of PANI nanoparticles
in the synthesis of the nPANI@nZIF-8 material in this study.

Similar results for the IR analysis of nZIF-8, the N–H stretch
band at 3135 cm–1, and the C–H stretches
of the methyl groups at 2929 cm–1 (C–H aliphatic
imidazole) and 1307 cm–1 are reported in the literature.43 The peak corresponding to the C–N and
C=N bonds are located at 1457, 1423, and 1145 cm–1, displaced because of the coordination with the metal center. The
absorption band at 421 cm–1 is associated with the
Zn–N stretch mode. An overlap occurs with the stretches and
bands of the PANI nanoparticles.40 The
peaks at about 1594 and 1504 cm–1 represent the
quinoid and benzenoid rings present in nPANI. The peaks at 1300 and
1100 cm–1 are related to the C–N and C=N
stretching modes, respectively, increasing the peak intensity in this
region, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Overlapping IR spectra of nPANI, ZIF-8, and nPANI@nZIF-8.

The TEM images confirmed that
nPANI modified the external surface
of nZIF-8 (Figure 3b). This modification could be due to the electrostatic attraction
and chelation mechanism, between the basic sites of PANI (amine and
imine nitrogen along the polymer backbone) and the metal cation (Zn2+).44 When synthesized with nPANI,
the color of nZIF-8 turned from white to violet. This color is due
to the presence of nPANI at its highest oxidation state.45 The TEM image of pure nZIF-8 is also shown for
comparison (Figure 3a). The average particle size of nZIF-8 was approximately 80 nm.
After contact with nPANI, the size of nPANI@nZIF-8 increased to approximately
200 nm.

Figure 3 TEM analysis of pure nZIF-8 (a) and synthesized nPANI@nZIF-8 (5
v/v % of the nPANI solution) (b).

The stability and thermal decomposition of the samples were
evaluated
by thermogravimetric analysis before and after the decoration process
with PANI (Figure 4a,b, respectively). The thermoanalytical profile of nZIF-8 displays
a single step, which can be interpreted as the loss of the organic
ligand, imidazolate, between the temperature ranges of 350–650
°C. The missing C is combined with zinc to form ZnC, generating
a residual mass, after loss of the ligand, which corresponds to 33.6%
of the molecular mass of ZIF-8. nPANI@nZIF-8 had the same thermoanalytical
profile as pure nZIF-8, but with a change in the temperature range
in the loss of the organic ligand, imidazolate, from 350 to 750 °C,
approximately. This greater stability of the material could be due
to the presence of PANI nanoparticles.

nPANI@nZIF-8 (b).

2.2 Loading
and Release of the 5-FU Drug
To achieve a greater therapeutic
efficacy, the 5-FU drug was selected
as an antitumor model because of its small size, as well as its extensive
use in the treatment of colorectal, breast, head, and neck cancers.46 UV–vis absorption spectroscopy was used
to determine the effective storage capacity of 5-FU in nPANI@nZIF-8.

Because of the presence of the PANI nanoparticles, there was a
drastic decrease in the volume of the mesopores of the nZIF-8 metallographic
network. Therefore, loading of the 5-FU drug occurred preferentially
in the micropores. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of nPANI@nZIF-8
before and after loading the 5-FU drug are shown in Figure 5 and pointed a decrease in
the surface area from 1418.86 to 876.29 m2 g–1 and pore volume from 0.57 to 0.39 cm3 g–1 after loading the drug.

Figure 5 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
of ZIF-8 before
and after loading the 5-FU drug.

Figure 6 shows
the
UV–vis absorption spectra of the original 5-FU aqueous solution
(0 h) and the residual 5-FU content in the supernatant after the interaction
with nPANI@nZIF-8 (48 h). The aliquots were analyzed by UV–vis,
and the 5-FU drug was quantified using the calibration curve (Y = 15.52952, X = 0.09699, R2 = 0.9967).

Figure 6 Absorption spectrum of the 5-FU drug before
and after contact with
nPANI@nZIF-8 (48 h). In the inset, the 5-FU calibration curve at 285
nm is shown.

The adsorption process
was effective at 20.22%. The drug encapsulation
efficiency (DEE), calculated by the decomposition of 1 mg of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU,
approximately (18.17%), confirmed the amount of drug loaded in the
adsorption process. These results are compared to the weight of the
total drug injected. This small variation suggests that the adsorptive
process is not completely homogeneous over the mass of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU.

The drug loading content (DLC) shows a load of 0.3 mg of 5-FU mg–1 nPANI@nZIF-8 according to the adsorption kinetic
curve (Figure S4).

To investigate
the behavior of 5-FU, the cumulative release profiles
in the buffer solutions with pH 7.2, pH 5.2, and pH 5.2 under NIR
laser irradiation were tested.

Approximately 58 and 68% of the
encapsulated 5-FU were released
at pH 7.2 and pH 5.2, respectively, after 6 h, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 5-FU release profiles
from system-loaded nPANI@nZIF-8@5-FU in buffer
solutions with pH 7.2, pH 5.2, and pH 5.2 under NIR laser ON/OFF irradiation
(980 nm, 0.8 W cm–2).

The initial rapid drug release is due by the quick release
of 5-FU
molecules adsorbed onto the surface of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU. The other
5-FU molecules entrapped in the pores and cavities of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
are released slowly. This has also been observed in other papers reported
in the literature using the MOF ZIF-8 as the carrier of the 5-FU drug.46,47

The release of 5-FU from nPANI@nZIF-8 has presented the best
answer
at a lower pH. This result is associated with the partial or total
decomposition of nZIF-8 as has been reported previously.4,35,36,46 These release behaviors make nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU a potential pH-responsive
drug delivery system for cancer therapy. In general, tumor cells present
a higher acidic condition47 (pH 4.5–6.0);
therefore, this is the place where there will be a greater delivery
of the drug.

Under the action of the NIR laser, the cumulative
release profile
of the 5-FU drug in the buffer solution at pH 5.2 reached 80%. This
increase shows that the NIR light significantly enhanced the release
of the drug. Temperature is an important factor in the control of
the diffusion rate of drug molecules.16 Absorption of the NIR light by PANI causes local hyperthermia by
aiding the diffusion of the drug molecules contained by the polymer
into nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU.

Powder XRD was performed to evaluate
the possible alterations in
the ZIF-8 structure. The XRD analysis of nPANI@nZIF-8 showed no change
compared to the XRD of the MOF ZIF-8 (COD # 4118891). The XRD spectra
showed intense, narrow, and well-defined peaks, indicating the crystallinity
of nZIF-8, as reported in the literature.43,48 Thus, there was no change in the crystallographic phases of the
network nZIF-8 because of the presence of PANI nanoparticles (Figure 8), indicating a low
nPANI concentration and a lower XRD signal intensity compared with
nZIF-8.

Figure 8 Overlapping diffractograms of ZIF-8 (theoric), nZIF-8@nPANI, nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU,
and 5-FU.

The incorporation of the 5-FU
drug maintains the crystallinity
of the network, as shown in Figure 8, with a diffractogram illustrating the characteristic
peaks of nZIF-8. It is suggested that the disappearance of the 5-FU
peak in the XRD analysis is due to the dissolution of the 5-FU crystals
in methanol and subsequent “molecular” loading, of 5-FU,
in the ZIF-8 network. Similar results have been described in the literature.
Sun46 and Gao47 reported the preservation of the crystallinity of the ZIF-8 network
in the process of incorporation of the 5-FU drug.

The IR spectra
indicates the incorporation of the drug molecule
after loading 5-FU in nPANI@nZIF-8. New peaks were observed, which
linked the drug49 (Figure 9). The peak 1275 cm–1 belongs
to the stretch band C–F, the peak 1650 cm–1 belongs to the carbonyl stretch of 5-FU (C=O), and the peak
3000–3500 cm–1 belongs to the −NH
band of 5-FU.

and nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU.

2.3 Photothermal Effect of nPANI@nZIF-8
The strength of the NIR uptake of the PANI nanoparticles described
in the literature motivated us to investigate their application as
photothermic ablation agents, in a multifunctional nanomaterial together,
with the porous network nZIF-8.

In the absorption spectrum,
only aqueous solutions of nPANI and nPANI@nZIF-8 showed the NIR absorption
band in the range 700–1100 nm. The pure nZIF-8 produced an
absorption band at 214 nm (Figure 10). Therefore, the photothermal effect was attributed
in the presence of the PANI nanoparticles. This proves the potential
use of nPANI@nZIF-8 as photothermal ablation agents in cancerous cells.

Figure 10 UV–vis
spectra of nZIF-8 (solid), nPANI (aqueous), and nPANI@nZIF-8
(solid).

In an aqueous solution, the nPANI@nZIF-8
absorption bands displaced
to the right, increasing the absorption in the NIR region as shown
in Figure 11. The
changes in the values of the absorption bands suggest the nPANI interaction
with nZIF-8.

Figure 11 UV–vis spectra of nPANI@nZIF-8, solid and in suspension
aqueous.

To analyze the photothermal profile
of nPANI@nZIF-8, 200 μL
of the solution of this nanomaterial in different concentrations (0.0625,
0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg mL–1) was irradiated
under the NIR laser (980 nm, 0.8 W cm–2) for 5 min
(Figure 12), with
pure water selected as the control. The local maximum temperatures
could be measured using an IR thermal camera. The temperature rose
with each increased concentration of nPANI@nZIF-8 and with the increase
of the irradiation time. Furthermore, we evaluated the photothermal
conversion efficiency (η) of nPANI@nZIF-8 used in eqs 1 and 2 described
in the Experimental Procedure section using the same parameters, laser
power (0.8 W cm–2) and concentration (250 μg/mL),
used in the cell viability assay. The value obtained was η =
41%. This result indicates that nPANI@nZIF-8 shows a high potential
to be used as the photothermal agent at the PPT.

Figure 12 Photothermal effects
of a solution of nPANI@nZIF-8 using NIR irradiation
(λ = 980 nm) for 5 min, in the volume of 200 μL with different
concentrations: 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg mL–1 and in pure water at 0.8 W cm–2.

In the cell viability test, under the action of
the laser, we could
notice that the power of 800 mW allows a cellular viability of 98.62%.
Therefore, irradiation of the cell culture medium for 5 min does not
cause cell death at this potency, suggesting that the average temperature
in the region is lower than the maximum point temperature.

The
use of 980 nm laser has some advantages compared to lasers
with smaller wavelengths. For example, the conservative limit of 980
nm laser intensity set for human skin exposure is ∼0.726 W
cm–2, which is more than twice that (∼0.33
W cm–2) of the 808 nm laser, based on the American
National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers. Thus, the depth of irradiation
of the laser at 980 nm can be several centimeters in biological tissues.

We used a power of 0.8 W cm–2, which is the same
power used in the test with in vitro cancer cells, less than that
reported in other studies.14

2.4 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The effect
of NIR laser and the potential cytotoxicity of synthesized nPANI@nZIF-8
against the breast cancer line MCF7 cells were examined. An experiment
which related to the effect of NIR laser on cell viability under different
power densities was further studied. Figure 13 shows that more than 93.32% of MCF7 cells
survived after irradiation with the NIR laser at the power densities
of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 W cm–2. When the
power density of the NIR laser was increased to 1.0 W cm–2, however, the cell viability decreased to a 66.33% survival. This
decrease of cell viability can be attributed to hyperthermia triggered
by the NIR laser at the greater power density. Given these results,
we selected a laser power density of 0.8 W cm–2 to
be used in the following experiments considering that this density
triggered a sufficient photothermal conversion effect for cancer PTT
and was less cytotoxic for cells (98.62%).

Figure 13 Effect of NIR laser
(980 nm) on the cell viability of MCF7 cells.

The MCF7 cells were treated with different concentrations
(0–1000
μg/mL) of nPANI@nZIF-8 for 72 h, and then an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure the mitochondrial
activity in the viable cells. Figure 14 shows the concentrations between 62.5 and 250 μg/mL,
demonstrating the percentages of the viable cells over 80%, suggesting
no appreciable cytotoxicity of nPANI@nZIF-8 up to 250 μg/mL.
However, concentrations above 500 μg/mL decreased the cell viability.
Therefore, the chemo-PTT assay in vitro was performed in the concentrations
of 125 and 250 μg/mL.

incubation with nPANI@nZIF-8

are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

The stability of nPANI@nZIF-8 exhibited an excellent homogeneity
and stability in the water and culture medium for up to 8 h (Figure 15) and showed the
stability for in vitro biomedical applications.

(500 μg/mL) system in the culture

and 8 h (d).

2.5 Chemo-PTT
in Vitro of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU Nanoparticles
To investigate
the chemo-photothermal in vitro effects of the nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
nanoparticles on therapeutic efficiency, MCF7 cells were treated for
72 h with the free 5-FU (0.0625 μg/mL), nPANI@nZIF-8 (125 and
250 μg/mL), and nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU at the same concentrations.
This procedure was followed by NIR irradiation for 5 min at 0.8 W
cm–2. As shown in Figure 16, in the concentrations studied, nPANI@nZIF-8
kept the cell viability above 80%. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of
the 5-FU-loaded nPANI@nZIF-8 was significant, reducing the viability
to 70.32 and 58.98% at the concentrations of 125 and 250 μg/mL,
respectively.

Figure 16 In vitro cytotoxicity of free 5-FU, nPANI@nZIF-8, nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU,
and nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU nanoparticles in different concentrations (0.25
and 0.125 mg mL–1) on MCF7 cells after 72 h of incubation.
The values are shown as mean ± SD; n = 4, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.

When NIR irradiation was applied to treat the MCF7
cells after
incubation with the nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU nanoparticles, the cell viability
decreased significantly (approximately 50 and 33% at the concentrations
of 125 and 250 μg/mL, respectively).

The nanomaterials
carried with 5-FU were shown to be more efficient
than the free drug.

According to Tian et al, the use of functionalized
nZIF-8, with
photoabsorbers, located in tumors, resulted in the irreversible cell
damage and subsequent destruction of the tumor because of the conversion
of the NIR-irradiated energy into heat.4 This contributes to its use as a multifunctional platform and thus
increases the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, it can be concluded
that nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU shows the potential as a new chemo-photothermal
platform for cancer therapy.

3 Conclusions
The multifunctional system has been developed and used successfully
as a new platform for cancer therapy. The development of nPANI@nZIF-8
was achieved quickly and effectively, validated by the characterization
reported, and used as a carrier of the 5-FU drug in the nZIF-8 and
the nPANI-decorated networks as a photothermal agent. The drug release
resulted in an improved pH, and under NIR laser irradiation, reaching
80%. The cellular viability of the MCF7 cells decreased significantly,
approximately 33%, after incubation with nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU and laser
NIR action at 0.8 W cm–2 in 5 min. Therefore, it
can be concluded that nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU has an excellent chemo-photothermal
effect against breast cancer cells and thus shows a high potential
for PTT.

4 Experimental Procedure
4.1 Materials
and Methods
All the reagents
used here were analytically pure unless stated otherwise. The solutions
were prepared in water purified by reverse osmosis and then deionized
(18MΩcm) with a Milli-Q gradient Millipak 40. The pH of the
solutions was measured with the aid of a Quimis Q400MT pH meter.

Aniline (Vetec), C6H5NH2, high-performance
liquid chromatography grade supplied by Aldrich, was distilled under
vacuum at a temperature of 60 °C before being used.

Other
chemicals employed were HCl (Vetec) to adjust the pH, oxidant
(NH4)2S2O8 (Aldrich),
surfactant C12H25NaSO4 (Merck), solvent
methanol (Dinâmica), 2-methyl imidazole (Aldrich), Zn(NO3)2 (Aldrich), and drug 5-FU (Aldrich).

The
hyperthermia study was performed with the aid of a laser (laser
diode), serial number, 1002, DMC LTD instrument equipped with an excitation
diode of 980 ± 10 nm, optical fiber UV/SR, and 600 μm.
The thermographic images were obtained by a FLIR model E4 Thermovisor.

4.2 Synthesis of nPANI@nZIF-8
To obtain
a solution of nPANI, 83 μL of the aniline monomer was used,
0.042 g of oxidant (NH4)2S2O8 and 1.329 g of the surfactant that had been already used
for the synthesis of PANI nanoparticles in the micellar solution50 and sodium dodecyl sulfate C12H25NaSO4. These reagents were dissolved in the acid
medium, 50 mL of aqueous 0.1 M HCl. The reagents were left under stirring
for 24 h.

The synthesis of decorated nZIF-8 was adapted from
the methodology of Guang Lu et al.37 Volumes
(50, 10, 5, and 1 mL) of the previously prepared nPANI solution were
added and with enough methanol to make a 100 mL final solution. Then,
these volumes were divided into two containers to dissolve the reagents
2-methyl imidazole (810 mg) and zinc nitrate (742 mg). Then, the solution
containing the ligand was added to the beaker containing the metal
ion and allowed to stir for 15 min. After that time, it was left for
24 h to rest. After the synthesis, the solution was centrifuged, and
the final product was washed with 1:1 methanol and water and suspended
three times with the aid of a Vortex stirrer. The final solid was
dried in a desiccator coupled to a vacuum pump.

4.3 Characterization of nPANI@nZIF-8 and nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
Diffractograms were recorded at room temperature in the range of
5°–50° in a Rigaku 2400 D/Max X-ray diffractometer
with Cu Kα (0.15 nm). Vibrational spectra were obtained by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, in a VERTEX 70/70v
Bruker FTIR spectrometer, performed on KBr pellets in the range of
4000–400 cm–1. The TGAs were performed in
a Shimadzu DTG-60H analyzer in a N2 atmosphere from room
temperature to 800 °C (10 °C/min–1). The
pore volume and the surface area measurements were performed in a
Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. About 100 mg of each sample was
dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h, before being placed in a
quartz cuvette and attached to the physisorption apparatus. The sample
was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 5 h. The BET surface area
and the pore volume were obtained by N2 physisorption at
77.4 K. A thermos-scientific Jeol JEM 2100 transmission electron microscope
enabled us to acquire the high-resolution images for the nanometric
compounds. The images were obtained using the microscope user interface
(Fey Company) and TEM Imagine and Analysis software.

4.4 Photothermal Effect of nPANI@nZIF-8
The temperature
elevation of nPANI@nZIF-8 was investigated in an
aqueous solution under irradiation with a laser NIR (λ = 980
nm).

A volume of 200 μL of the aqueous solution of nPANI@nZIF-8
in suspension, at different concentrations (0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25,
0.5, and 1 mg mL–1), was irradiated under 980 nm
NIR laser at different power densities (0.5 to 1 W cm–2) for 5 min. The temperature was monitored by heating maps that were
recorded by a thermal imager (FLIR E4) every 5 s for a period of 5
min.

4.5 Photothermal Conversion Efficiency (η)
The photothermal conversion efficiency was calculated using eq 1, already reported in the
literature.18,51 The temperature variation as
a function of time was recorded under continuous irradiation of the
980 nm laser, with a power density of 0.8 W cm–2 in a nPANI@nZIF-8 solution (250 μg/mL) for 5 min. 1  where h is the heat-transfer
coefficient, S is the container surface area, Tmax is the equilibrium temperature of the nPANI@nZIF-8
system, Tvis is the ambient temperature, Q0 is associated with the heat generated only
by the quartz cuvette and the solvent (water) under irradiation of
the laser (0.8 W cm–2), A980 is the absorption intensity of nPANI@ZEEIF-8 (A980 = 0.03), and I is the incident laser
power 0.8 W cm–2. The value of hS was calculated from eq 2 2  where τ is the system time constant
represented by the slope of the cooling line of sample (Figure 17), mi is the mass of the cuvette (1.62 g) and mass of
the water (0.3 g), Cp,i is the calorific
capacity of the cuvette (0.89 J g–1K–1) and calorific capacity of water (4.19 J g–1 K–1).

4.6 Loaded
5-FU Drug in nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU Nanoparticles
The incorporation
of the 5-FU drug into nPANI@nZIF-8 was performed
by agitation for two days (48 h), according to the methodology adapted
as proposed by Sun et al.46

nPANI@nZIF-8
(40 mg) was dried and activated at 160 °C for 24 h in a vacuum
oven and subsequently added to the solution of the drug previously
prepared. The drug 5-FU (60 mg) was dissolved by stirring and sonicated
in 10 mL of methanol. Aliquots of the supernatant were collected at
predefined times over 48 h and analyzed by UV–vis to obtain
a kinetic adsorption curve (see Supporting Information S1 file). During the process, the 5-FU concentration was determined
from the absorbance at 285 nm with the aid of an external calibration
curve with standard solutions (0.01–0.07 mg mL–1).

To confirm the adsorption and the amount of the drug loaded,
nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
was completely decomposed with 0.35 μL of HCl (2 M), diluted
to 3 mL of phosphate-buffered solution (PBS), and analyzed by UV–vis.
The 5-FU DLC % of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU and the 5-FU DEE % were calculated
by the equations given below:52    

4.7 Drug Delivery and Studies under Stimulus Response
The
drug delivery study was conducted over a period of 48 h. nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
was resuspended in 0.5 mL of 0.1 M PBS, pH = 7.4, sealed within a
dialysis membrane (Mw cut, 3.5 kDa), and
placed in the release medium (3 mL of 0.1 M pure PBS) under oscillation.
At selected time intervals, 0.35 μL of the buffer of the release
medium (outside the dialysis bag) was collected in triplicate for
UV–vis analysis and replaced with a fresh buffer solution.
The released amount of 5-FU was determined using a 5-FU calibration
curve.

The stimulus response tests for drug release were performed
at pH = 5.2, also for 48 h and under the action of the NIR laser “on”
(λ = 980 nm, 0.8 W cm–2) at predetermined
times (for 5 min), for 6 h.

4.8 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
The in vitro
cytotoxicity of nPANI@nZIF-8 was evaluated using an MTT assay. In
this study, the breast cancer line MCF7 cells (1 × 104 cells per well) were seeded into the 96-well plates. Subsequently,
the cells were cultured in the RPMI 1640 media, containing 10% fetal
bovine serum, and incubated under a humidified atmosphere for 24 h
(37 °C, 5% CO2). To study the effect of NIR laser
on the cell viability, MCF7 cells were irradiated with the NIR laser
under different power densities for 5 min.

Another sample was
used to study the cytotoxicity of nPANI@nZIF-8. MCF7 cells (1 ×
104 cells per well) were also seeded into the 96-well plates
and subsequently incubated according to the method described above.
After that, the cells were respectively treated with nPANI@nZIF-8
in different concentrations (0–1000 μg/mL) for 72 h.
Then, all of the supernatants were removed, and the cells on the 96-well
plate were further treated with 20 μL of MTT (0.5 mg mL–1) and 1 μL of MTT in the RPMI 1640 cell culture
medium for 3 h. Subsequently, the MTT medium was carefully removed,
and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well and
measured at 578 nm on a multidetection microplate reader. Cytotoxicity
was expressed as the percentage of viable cells compared with that
of the untreated control cells.

4.9 Chemo-PTT
in Vitro of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
To evaluate the therapeutic
effect of nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU, MCF7 cells
were seeded into a 96-well plate with a density of 1 × 104 cells per well. The wells were divided into five teams which
were termed as follows: control, nPANI@nZIF-8 (125 and 250 μg/mL),
nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU (125 and 250 μg/mL), and nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU
+ NIR (125 and 250 μg/mL). The cells were then incubated for
72 h. Subsequently, nPANI@nZIF-8/5-FU + NIR were further irradiated
by the NIR laser (λ = 980 nm, 0.8 W cm–2)
for 5 min. After irradiation, 20 μL of MTT (0.5 mg mL–1) was added in each well, and the cells were incubated for another
3 h to measure the cell viability.

4.10 Statistical
Analysis
The data were
expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed using
STATISTICA 8 by the Student’s t-test. *P < 0.05 was considered significant, and **P < 0.01 was considered highly significant.
