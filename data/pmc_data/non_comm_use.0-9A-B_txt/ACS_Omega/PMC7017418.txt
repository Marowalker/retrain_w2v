We
report on the absorption, fluorescence, and two-photon excitation
spectra of a series of 5-phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline
dyes. Depending on the substituents, we observed increasing two-photon
absorption cross sections, with values up to 56 GM@973 nm, which are
similar to those of the enhanced green fluorescent protein and fluorescein,
common fluorescent chromophores.

Introduction
Two-photon excitation
is a phenomenon in which two photons are
simultaneously absorbed by a molecule, causing excitation. Because
visible fluorophores are used for bioimaging, near-infrared (NIR)
laser light pulses are used to induce two-photon excitation processes.
The excitation induced by NIR laser light offers superior penetration
depth and is less invasive for living specimens. Furthermore, two-photon
excitation is spatially localized at the focus of the excitation laser
light because of nonlinear dependence on photon density, which allows
for the acquisition of optically sectioned fluorescence images. Thus,
out-of-focus photobleaching, photodamage, and attenuation of the excitation
beam by out-of-focus absorption rarely occur. Therefore, two-photon
excitation microscopy is currently the strongest methodology used
to evaluate molecular and cellular mechanisms at some depths of an
organ.1

Also, it became evident that
in order for two-photon technology
to realize its full potential, more diverse dye scaffolds are needed
in the design and synthesis of more active dye molecules with the
necessary solubility and photostability. To facilitate the design
and synthesis of new active molecules, research was needed to establish
well-defined structure/property relationships for a large number of
organic structures. This required both the synthesis of highly pure,
well-defined organic dyes with systematically varied molecular structures
and the careful reproducible characterization of their two-photon
excitation properties.

In 2013, we reported a new tandem process
that combined a ruthenium-catalyzed
ring-closing metathesis (RCM) reaction with intermolecular 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition to give isoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline,2 a kind of indolizine,2b−2g core 2 (Scheme 1). Among the novel dyes, dyes 2a–2c had
fluorescence absorption in the region longer than 600 nm and the quantum
yield of dye 2c was the highest among these three in
chloroform (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Fluorescence Spectra of Compounds 2a–2c in Chloroform
This report describes
the absorption, fluorescence, and two-photon
excitation ability of several 5-phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline derivatives.

Results and Discussion
First, we
decided to synthesize five new 5-phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline derivatives, as shown in Scheme 3, that is, 3-methyl form 2d,
3-fluoro form 2e, 3-methoxy form 2f, 3-phenyl
form 2g, and derivative 2h, in which one
more condensed ring is added, were successfully prepared by our own
one-pot procedure, as explained in Scheme 1.

Scheme 3 Synthesis 5-Phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline Derivatives
The absorption and fluorescence spectra of these dyes are shown
in Schemes 4 and 5. In addition, Table 1 summarizes the quantum yield and the maximum wavelength
of these dyes in the absorption spectrum and the fluorescence spectrum.
In the wavelength region longer than 380 nm of the absorption spectrum,
although there was a slight difference in the maximum absorption wavelength
(468–494 nm), no significant difference could be confirmed
between these dyes. On the other hand, in the wavelength range shorter
than 380 nm, each dye exhibited a characteristic waveform, and 2g and 2h had large absorption bands at 280 and
300 nm, respectively.

Sulfoxide (DMSO)]
Scheme 5 Fluorescence Spectra
of 2c–2h (50 μM in
DMSO)
Table 1 Quantum Yield and
the Maximum Wavelength
of 2c–2h (50 μM in DMSO)
dye	ϕ	λex (nm)	Fmax (nm)	
2c	0.0029	475	594	
2d	0.0043	477	595	
2e	0.012	468	511	
2f	0.0012	481	599	
2g	0.0034	477	597	
2h	0.0018	494	540	
In the
fluorescence spectrum, 2c and 2g showed
almost the same waveform, but in the case of the other dyes,
not only the waveform but also the maximum value in the NIR region
greatly changed, depending on the substituent present in the scaffold.

Looking at the quantum yield, it was lower than 2c, 2f, and 2h, but it increased for the
other three compounds (2d, 2e, and 2g). In particular, while the quantum yield of the methoxy
form (2f) was about one-fourth of that of 2c, the quantum yield of the fluoro form (2b) was about
three times as large as 2c. Furthermore, as a result
of measuring the two-photon excitation spectrum of these compounds,
dyes 2c and 2g were found to be two-photon
excitation dyes (Scheme 6, 2c: σ973 nm = 56 GM, 2g: σ972 nm = 20 GM). Dyes 2c or 2g have almost twice brighter or comparable two-photon absorption
(TPA) cross-sectional values, respectively, as typical fluorophores
for two-photon excitation microscopy, fluorescein, and enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP)3,4 and follow the magnitude
of one-photon absorption.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized
five new 5-phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline derivatives
by one-pot reaction of RCM and intermolecular
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. We also measured the absorbance, fluorescence,
and two-photon excitation spectra of these dyes and found that the
5-phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline derivative is a
two-photon excited dye, even though their quantum yields are in the
range of 0.0018–0.012,5 whose TPA
cross-section value is similar to EGFP and fluorescein, common fluorescent
chromophores.

Procedure D for the Synthesis of 5-Phenylisoindolo[2,1-a]quinoline Derivatives (2d–h)
To a 0.01 M solution of N-allyl-N-protected aniline derivative (1 equiv) in benzene was added the
second-generation Grubbs catalyst (10 mol %) under the Ar atmosphere
and the mixture was refluxed for 0.5 h. To the mixture was then added
benzoquinone (10 equiv) and refluxed for an additional 1 h. The mixture
was cooled down to room temperature and quenched with a saturated
solution of NH4Cl. The solvent was partially removed by
an evaporator and the organic compounds were extracted with AcOEt.
The combined organic layer was then washed with brine, dried over
Na2SO4, and concentrated under vacuum. The obtained
residue was then subjected to column chromatography (first time neutral
silica gel, toluene/AcOEt = 20:1 to 5:1, second time neutral flash
silica gel, toluene/AcOEt = 20:1)

TPA Cross-Section Measurements
TPA cross-section spectra
of dyes 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g, and 2h were estimated as reported
previously by comparison to fluorescein as a standard with minor modifications.3,10 Dyes 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, 2g, and 2h were dissolved in DMSO to
concentrations of 1 mM, and fluorescein was dissolved in pH 11 sodium
phosphate buffer solution to a concentration of 0.1 mM. The fluorescence
images of their solutions filled in glass-bottom dishes were measured
by a two-photon excitation microscopy system equipped with a mode-locked
titanium:sapphire laser light source (Mai tai DeepSee eHP, Spectra
Physics), of which the wavelength is continuously tunable from 690
to 1040 nm, with a ca. 100 fs pulse width and 80 MHz repetition rate.
The laser light beam was introduced into a spinning-disk confocal
scanner (CSU-MP; Yokogawa Electric)11,12 installed
on an inverted microscope (Ti-E, Nikon) with a water-immersion objective
lens (LWD Lambda S 40XC WI 40×/1.27 NA, Nikon), and it was focused
on a specimen. Fluorescent lights acquired by the objective lens were
reflected by a dichroic mirror (700 nm shortpass filter, Yokogawa
Electric) and detected by an EM-CCD camera (iXon Ultra 897, Andor
Technology, Belfast, UK). The wavelength range of the irradiation
laser light pulses was from 750 to 1000 nm, with 10 nm intervals.
All fluorescent images of dye solutions were measured under the same
optical conditions, making it possible to correct the difference between
our two-photon microscopy system and the referred system. To avoid
fluorescence reabsorptions or two-photon excitation saturations, irradiated
laser powers were adjusted to the range where fluorescent intensities
were linear to the squared values of the excitation laser power values.
Because fluorescent signal intensities were in linear relation to
products of TPA cross-section values, quantum yield values, solution
concentrations, and TPA cross-section values of the targeted dye were
calculated backward to obtained fluorescent intensities and reported
values of fluorescein. Finally, the calculated TPA cross-section values
were plotted against the irradiated laser light wavelength.
