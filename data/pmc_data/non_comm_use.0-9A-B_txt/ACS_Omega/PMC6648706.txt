Owing to the inhomogeneous distribution
of FLiNaK salt impregnated
into graphite which is observed by scanning electron microscopy and
an element probe micro-analyzer, a map scan of in situ real-time tensile
synchrotron-based two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2D-XRD) at several
fixed external forces was implemented to reveal the local microstructure
evolution of graphite and FLiNaK salt. Notably, a stress concentration
area (SCA), that is, the main interaction area between graphite and
salt, was found and then transformed from one region to another region
because of the unbalanced squeeze interaction between graphite and
FLiNaK salt with the increase of external force. During the external
stress load process, a smaller grain size, poorer crystallinity of
graphite and a larger grain size, better crystallinity of FLiNaK salt
appear in the SCA; meanwhile, the changes of crystallographic preferred
orientation of FLiNaK salt domains in SCA imply that the external
load force makes better the ordered stacking of the larger crystal
grains of the FLiNaK salt impregnated into graphite. Most importantly,
we have found for the first time that the fracture position of graphite
impregnated with FLiNaK salt always occurs near the SCA rather than
at a fixed region under the external stress load. Thus, the present
study not only helps to reveal the interaction mechanism between graphite
and FLiNaK salt under the external stress load but also contributes
to accurately predict and analyze the stress state of components,
which would have an effective impact on the design of a molten salt
reactor and the reliability of the component safety assessment.

Introduction
A molten salt reactor
(MSR) is one of the six candidate reactors
in the fourth generation of the fission nuclear energy system.1,2 It is characterized by molten fluoride salt as the carrier of coolants
or fuels.3 In MSRs, graphite material is
used as the neutron moderator and reflector because of a series of
advantages, such as a high neutron scattering cross section, low neutron
absorption cross section, high density, and good thermal conductivity,
and so forth.3,4 Graphite is also used as the core
of structural material in the MSR, which needs to ensure the structural
integrity of the internal components of the reactor. One of the key
factors affecting the structural integrity of graphite components
is the mechanical properties of graphite materials,5 such as the bearing between graphite components, the asymmetry
of component structures, and the concentration of load-bearing stress
caused by unevenness.6,7 It is well known that the mechanical
properties of graphite are affected by the internal strain within
its microstructure. For example, the permanent deformation encountered
by nonirradiated graphite during the tensile process occurs on the
length scale of the microstructure because of the nonuniform microstructure.8,9 The change in pore volume caused by mechanical stress under the
tension process plays an important role in the reduction of Young’s
modulus.10 It has also been found in the
neutron and X-ray studies of polycrystalline graphite that the application
of tensile strain reduces the bulk elasticity modulus, and in the
case of tensile, the relationship between the elastic strain and the
applied strain in the graphite crystal is nonlinear.8 After the strained graphite is annealed, the residual strain
is alleviated and the stress–strain characteristics are also
restored.11

Furthermore, graphite
requires direct contact with molten salt
in the MSR.12 Owing to the complex porous
structure of graphite, molten salt easily penetrates into the pores
of graphite under a certain pressure, which would affect the mechanical
properties of graphite and therefore shorten the service life of graphite
material, resulting in a huge impact on the operation of the MSR.13 For example, Zhang et al. found that the compressive
strength tests show that the graphite sample impregnated with FLiNaK
salt shows a longitudinal splitting fracture rather than the shear
fracture of virgin graphite, and the corresponding failure mechanism
change is suggested to be an extra stress generated in graphite impregnated
with FLiNaK salt.13 Therefore, it is indispensable
to study the molten salt impregnation behavior of graphite in the
MSR. In our previous reports, we have found that the normal temperature
compressive strength of graphite increased significantly after FLiBe
molten salt impregnation, and with the increase of impregnation, the
compressive strength of graphite at room temperature increases, which
is mainly attributed to the fact that the solid FLiBe salt impregnated
into the graphite increases the load-bearing area of the graphite
material and reduces the stress under a certain external force.14,15 It is also found by Qi et al. that the d002 spacing of a graphite layer decreases with increase of the amount
of molten salt impregnation, indicating that the microstructure of
graphite and molten salt has a certain interaction, which has an effective
impact on the macroscopic mechanical properties of graphite.16 It is widely known that the interaction between
graphite and molten salt leads to a change in the pore structure of
the graphite, which is bound to affect the internal stress distribution
of the graphite. Meanwhile, the internal stress field distribution
of the graphite material will further evolve with a change of the
external stress load. With increase of the external stress load, defects
and damages in the graphite internal microstructure are further accumulated,
eventually leading to material fracture and component failure.17,18 Therefore, it is of great significance to study the fracture behavior
of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt under external tensile force.
However, there have been few reports on in situ studies on the tensile
fracture of graphite impregnated with molten salt.

Herein, in
situ tensile synchrotron-based two-dimensional X-ray
diffraction (2D-XRD) was used to characterize the tensile fracture
behavior of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt, which can reveal
the real-time microstructure interaction between graphite material
and the molten salt. Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and an electron
probe micro-analyzer (EPMA) were further used to analyze the defects,
morphology, and element distribution of graphite impregnated with
FLiNaK salt before and after the fracture. Owing to the inhomogeneous
distribution of FLiNaK salt impregnated into graphite bulk, a map
scan (11 points × 3 lines with a beam size of 0.2 × 0.2
mm2) of in situ synchrotron-based 2D-XRD at several fixed
forces was carried out to reveal the local microstructure evolution
and their corresponding strain distribution. Notably, it is found
that during the application of the external load, the strain concentration
area (SCA), that is, the main interaction area between graphite and
salt was found, which would lead to the fracture of graphite. With
increase of external force, the SCA has been transformed from one
region to another region because of the unbalanced squeeze interaction
between graphite and salt resulting from the inhomogeneous distribution
of FLiNaK salt impregnated into graphite bulk. Thus, all of the results
will contribute to understand the interaction mechanism between graphite
and FLiNaK salt and help to explain the change of mechanical properties
of graphite impregnated with molten salt, which are conducive to the
fabrication of high-performance graphite and safe operation of the
MSR.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the obvious pore characteristics of the NBG-18 graphite with pore
size from several microns up to subhundred microns before FLiNak salt
impregnation, mainly resulting from the aggregate particles and binders
of NBG-18 graphite during the fabrication process.19,20Figure 1b shows the
EDS analysis of the C element of Figure 1a, which further confirms the pores presented
in graphite. These pores provide a channel through which the molten
salt can penetrate from the surface into the microstructure. It is
well known that graphite contains two types of pores: closed pores
and open pores.21 Salt occupies open pores,
and the distribution of salt in graphite represents the distribution
of open pores. Figure 1c shows a morphology image of the graphite surface after FLiNaK salt
impregnation, and Figure 1d shows an EDS analysis of the element F of Figure 1c, which shows an observable
inhomogeneous distribution of the salt in graphite. Figure S1a shows the morphology of the fracture surface of
graphite. Studies have demonstrated that the pores inside the graphite
are a network structure.22 It can be predicted
that the molten salt impregnated into the graphite will also have
a network structure after the molten salt impregnation experiment.
As can be seen from the enlarged view of the salt of Figure S1b that some of the salt exhibits a network structure,
which is well consistent with the above guess. The distribution of
salt on a large area of the fracture surface of the graphite sample
impregnated with FLiNaK salt after the tensile fracture was analyzed
using an EPMA, as displayed in Figure 1e. The distribution of F (Figure 1f), Na (Figure S2a), and K (Figure S2b) is compared with
the second electron image (Figure 1e). As shown in Figures 1f and S2a,b, the distribution
of F, Na, and K is superposed and their distributions are also the
same as the white-colored area in the second electron image shown
in Figure 1e. It is
found that the distribution of surface salt of the fracture surface
is also uneven. Owing to the uneven distribution of FLiNaK salt impregnated
into the graphite bulk, it is absolutely necessary that a map scan
of in situ 2D-XRD should carry out at different areas of graphite
to reveal the local microstructure evolution during the process of
applying external stress.

salt impregnation. (c,d) SEM and EDS images of the graphite sample

Figure 2a
shows
the in situ 2D-XRD experimental setup based on the BL14B1 diffraction
station of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) with X-ray
beam size 200 × 200 μm2 at 18 keV. In comparison
to the conventional X-ray diffraction facilities, synchrotron-based
X-ray diffraction could achieve a higher-quality powder diffraction
patterns in terms of the peak profile shape and the full width at
half-maximum (FWHM) resolution,23 which
enables better resolving capability as well as fitting results for
both qualitative and quantitative measurements. A series of in situ
tensile synchrotron-based 2D-XRD experiments were carried out on the
NBG-18 graphite sample after FLiNaK salt impregnation with a photo
of the experimental setup as shown in Figure 2b. The inset in Figure 2b is a photograph of the test graphite sample. Figure 2c clearly shows a
schematic representation of the test graphite sample. Prior to testing,
a wire cutter was utilized to cut a notch that is approximately one-third
the length of the sample. The notch has a diameter of 0.35 mm. A total
of three lines are measured, each of which measures 11 positions.
Position 6 of each line is approximately at the center of the notch.
The X-ray beam size of the SSRF BL14B1 line station is 200 ×
200 μm2, and the step of each movement is 100 μm.
The square with a side length of 200 μm represents the beam,
and the red solid circle represents the measured position, as displayed
in Figure 2c. Figure 2d shows the relationship
between tensile force and displacement, which obviously demonstrates
that before the external stress load is 5 N, the displacement increases
faster with the increase of the external stress load and after the
external stress load is 5 N, the displacement slowly increases with
the increase of the external stress load. In situ real-time 2D-XRD
diffraction technology is further adopted based on the fast 2D area
detection X-ray source of high-brightness synchrotron, which can provide
more colorful crystal structure information. Figure 2e–g shows the 2D-XRD profiles of graphite
impregnated with FLiNaK salt at tensile forces 0, 15, and 27 N. The
narrow and spotty scattered rings at q ≈ 26.9
nm–1 in Figure 2e–g are from the LiF(111)/NaF(200) diffraction
peak of FLiNaK salt, which indicates that the molten salt with good
crystallization has impregnated into the graphite sample after the
FLiNaK salt impregnation experiment. It can be seen from Figure 2e–g that the
diffraction ring has undergone significant changes during the external
stress load process. This mainly reflects the interaction between
the graphite layer and the molten salt during the external stress
load process.

Figure 3 shows
a
series of mapping distribution pictures of the layer spacing d002, FWHM, and intensity of the (002) diffraction
peak of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt in the area 1.2 ×
0.4 mm2 centered on the notch marked in Figure 2c, which illustrates that all
of the values in the map present an obvious fluctuation due to the
inhomogeneous distribution of FLiNaK salt impregnated into the graphite
bulk. The external load stress values tested in different positions
are 0, 15, and 27 N, respectively. Figure 3a shows that the layer spacing d002 of graphite without external stress load is relatively
small near position 5 in the map because of the squeeze between the
salt and graphite layers,24,25 implying that this
area shows an obvious interaction between graphite layers and salt
domains, which can be called the stress concentration area (SCA). Figure 3b,c shows that d002 in the map represents a slight decrease
under 15 and 27 N load, indicating that the squeeze between the salt
and graphite layers could be improved by external stress load. Notably,
the SCA changed from the position 5 (0 N) to position 8 (27 N), which
demonstrated that the graphite layer spacing in the interaction areas
between the salt and graphite was different after the addition of
the external load stress because of the inhomogeneous distribution
of FLiNaK salt impregnated into the graphite bulk. Notably, we have
found that the fracture area of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt
is near position 8 based on a series of tensile tests. Figure 3d–f shows the variation
of the FWHM of the (002) diffraction peak in different areas, which
indicates that the different extrusions of salt in the map can result
in different size increases of graphite grains. Figure 3d shows that FWHM of the (002) diffraction
peak of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt near SCA (position 5)
is relatively larger than that of other areas when no external stress
was applied, implying that a smaller size of graphite grain appeared
in the SCA. After the external load was applied, the FWHM of position
8 (27 N) is larger than that of other areas, which is well consistent
with the change of SCA discussed above, which further indicates that
the external load stress reduces the grain size of graphite impregnated
with FLiNaK salt. Figure 3g–i reflects the variation of the intensity of the
(002) diffraction peak in different areas, which indicates that the
different extrusions of salt in the map have an influence on the crystallinity
of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt. Figure 3g shows that the intensity of the (002) diffraction
peak of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt in SCA (position 5)
is relatively smaller than other areas when no external stress was
applied, implying that the crystallinity of the graphite impregnated
with FLiNaK salt becomes worse in the SCA. After the external load
was applied, the intensity of position 8 (27 N) is smaller than that
of other areas, which indicates that the external load stress reduces
the crystallinity of the graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt.

based on the values of d002, FWHM, and
the intensity, respectively.

In order to understand the interaction between the microstructure
of the graphite and the salt, the crystallinity of salt in the SCA
was also analyzed. A series of LiF(111)/NaF(200) diffraction peaks
of FLiNaK salt were further analyzed. Figure 4 shows a range of mapping distribution pictures
of the layer spacing dLiF111/NaF200, FWHM,
and intensity of the LiF salt (111)/NaF salt (200) diffraction peak
in the same region 1.2 × 0.4 mm2, which demonstrates
that all of the values in the map show a distinct fluctuation, indicating
an obvious different crystallinity of salt impregnated into graphite
bulk because of the inhomogeneous distribution of FLiNaK salt. Figure 4a shows that the
layer spacing dLiF111/NaF200 of the salt
is relatively small in the SCA (position 5) in the map when the external
load is 0 N, which is attributed to the squeeze between graphite and
the salt. After the addition of the external load stress, Figure 4b,c shows that dLiF111/NaF200 in the map in the SCA (position
8) is smaller than that in other areas, which demonstrates that the
main interaction areas between graphite and the salt have been changed
from position 5 to 8 because of the unbalanced stress response of
graphite and salt. Figure 4d–f shows the FWHM changes in the LiF(111)/NaF(200)
diffraction peak of the LiF/NaF salt at different areas in the map,
which indicates that the different extrusions of graphite can result
in different size increases of FLiNaK salt domains. As shown in Figure 4d, the FWHM of the
(111)/(200) diffraction peak of LiF/NaF salt in the SCA (position
5) is relatively small when no external stress was applied (0 N),
implying a larger size of FLiNaK salt grains in the SCA. After the
external load was applied, the FWHM of position 8 (27 N) is smaller
than that of other areas, indicating that the external load stress
has increased the grain size of FLiNaK salt. Figure 4g–i reflects the variation of the
(111)/(200) diffraction peak intensity of LiF/NaF salt in different
areas, which clearly demonstrates that different extrusions of salt
in the map have also influenced the crystallinity of FLiNaK salt. Figure 4g shows that the
intensity of the (111)/(200) diffraction peak of LiF/NaF salt near
SCA (position 5) is larger than that in other areas when no external
stress was applied, implying that the crystallinity of the FLiNaK
salt is improved in the SCA. After applying the external load, the
intensity of the (111)/(200) diffraction peak at the position 8 becomes
larger than that in the other regions, which further confirms that
the SCA has been changed from position 5 to position 8 because of
the application of external load stress, improving the crystallinity
of the FLiNaK salt with different degrees because of the inhomogeneous
distribution of FLiNaK salt impregnated into graphite.

and (g–i) Images based on the values of dLiF111/NaF200, FWHM, and the intensity, respectively.

It is widely known that the crystallographic
orientations of different
structural domains in all directions can be examined in detail by
radially integrating the corresponding scattered ring.26 Subsequently, the scattering rings corresponding
to the typical (002) crystalline plane at q ≈
18.7 nm–1 of graphite and the (111)/(200) crystalline
plane at q ≈ 26.9 nm–1 of
the LiF/NaF salt in different areas were radially integrated and plotted
as functions of the azimuth angle,26,27 as displayed
in Figure 5a,b. Figure 5a demonstrates clearly
that the azimuth orientation of the preferential out-of-plane orientation
of the graphite (002) plane is different in the SCA because of the
different extrusion effects between the salt and graphite caused by
the inhomogeneous distribution of salt. Although the integrated intensity
changes of graphite (002) peaks at position 5 and position 8 are not
obvious, the transitions of the orientation azimuth degree along the
out-of-plane direction show a reverse shift under external load stress,
which demonstrates a different texture evolution of graphite domains
because of the synergism from salt and external stress. Obviously,
as shown in Figure 5b, the azimuth orientation of the preferential out-of-plane orientation
of the LiF/NaF salt (111)/(200) plane in the FLiNaK salt shows a series
of sharp peaks and a significant change in intensity at position 5
and position 8 under external load, indicating that the crystallographic
orientation of FLiNaK salt impregnated into graphite becomes much
more orderly. However, the higher intensity and the narrower peaks
of the (111)/(200) salt diffraction peak in position 5 are obvious
than the position 8, implying that the crystallinity and order stacking
of the FLiNaK salt are better in position 5, which indicates that
graphite impregnated with the FLiNaK salt is not easily fractured
at this position. These above changes can clearly illustrate a model
diagram of an ordered stacking shown in Figure 5c, which illustrated that the ordered stacking
of graphite and FLiNaK salt in a certain azimuth will become more
orderly with multiorientation induced by the external load stress.
The red squares represent the salt domains, and the lines and curves
represent the graphite domains.

In summary, these above results observed by in situ synchrotron-based
2D-XRD illustrate clearly the evolution of the SCA under external
load stress based on the crystalline changes of graphite and salt,
which contribute to the understanding of the reason the fracture broken
position of graphite impregnated with salt easily occurs near the
SCA, where a smaller grain size, poorer crystallinity of graphite
and a larger grain size, good crystallinity of FLiNaK salt during
the external load process appear.

In order to further reveal
the structure evolution of graphite
impregnated with FLiNaK salt induced by each external force used in
the present study, the in situ 2D-XRD patterns collected at the center
of the map during the whole stretching process are further analyzed
as shown in Figure S3. Figure 6a shows a series of the one-dimensional
X-ray diffraction (1D-XRD) spectrum of the (002) diffraction peak
of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt during the external load
process, which is integrated from 2D-XRD patterns as shown in Figure S3. As shown in Figure 6b, the (002) peak of graphite impregnated
with FLiNaK salt presents an obvious shift to the higher 2θ
diffraction angle from 11.762° to 11.777° (meanwhile the
(004) peak, a senior peak, shows a similar shift trend) and a gradual
decrease in the layer spacing d002 during
the external load process. It was also observed that the layer spacing d002 has a mutation during the tensile force
3 N, and d002 remains almost unchanged
during the subsequent tensile process. Figure 6c shows the change in FWHM and the intensity
of the (002) diffraction peak of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK
salt under external stress load. It is clear that the FWHM of the
(002) diffraction peak of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt first
increases from 0.173° (0 N) to 0.179° (5 N), then falls,
and finally remains almost unchanged from 20 to 42 N. The intensity
ratio of the (002) diffraction peak graphite impregnated with FLiNaK
salt first decreased from ∼0.50 to ∼0.13, then increased
to ∼1, and finally remained unchanged during the subsequent
tensile process. In addition, if we continue to increase the external
tensile force from 42 N up to above the threshold tensile, the graphite
impregnated with FLiNaK salt in the present study becomes a fracture. Figure 6d shows a series
of the one-dimensional X-ray diffraction (1D-XRD) spectrum of the
LiF(111)/NaF(200) diffraction peak of FLiNaK salt during the external
load process. As shown in Figure 6e, the LiF(111)/NaF(200) diffraction peak of FLiNaK
salt presents an obvious shift to the higher 2θ diffraction
angle from 16.943° to 17.0° and a gradual decrease in dLiF111/NaF200 spacing during the external load
process. Figure 6f
shows the relationship of FWHM, intensity, and external load force.
With increase of the external load, the intensity of the LiF/NaF salt
gradually decreases, and the FWHM gradually increases, indicating
the poorer crystallinity of FLiNaK salt during the external load process.
Thus, in the present study, the fracture position of graphite impregnated
with FLiNaK salt under the external stress load occurs at the SCA
rather than at the center of the map as shown in Figure 2c, which might be attributed
to the different residual elastic strain distributions in graphite,
resulting from the unexpected pores and inhomogeneous distribution
of FLiNaK salt impregnated into graphite. Notably, at the center of
the map, the evolutions of the d002 spacing,
FWHM, and intensity of the (002) diffraction peak of graphite impregnated
with FLiNaK salt during the tensile process indicate that the external
load has increased the crystallinity and decreases the layer spacing
of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt via affecting the release
process of graphite residual elastic strains.8,14,24,25

Moreover, Raman spectrum analysis
was further implemented to confirm
the external load which improves the crystallinity of graphite after
FLiNaK salt impregnation, which is one of the most effective tools
widely used to characterize carbon materials and can provide effective
information on basic microstructures such as in-plane grain size,28,29 defects,30 and disorder of carbon materials.31Figure 6g,h shows the Raman spectra of graphite impregnated with FLiNaK
salt near the pores before tensile force (0 N) and after the tensile
fracture, respectively. The simultaneous presence of the D band, the
D1 band, the G band, and the D′ band in the Raman spectrum
indicates the presence of defects in graphite. The integrated intensity
ratio (R = ID/IG) of the D and G bands is related to the degree
of disorder of the carbon materials. When graphite was not subjected
to the external load and tensile fracture, the values of R are 0.52 and 0.25, respectively, indicating that the degree of disorder
decreased, the defects became less, and the crystallinity became better
of NBG-18 graphite after during the external tensile load process.
The analysis of the Raman spectrum confirms the above results by XRD.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the real-time interaction of molten salt and graphite
during the external tensile load process was investigated by in situ
tensile synchrotron-based 2D-XRD. A map scan of synchrotron-based
XRD revealed that the SCA of graphite impregnated with the FLiNaK
salt appeared because of the inhomogeneous distribution of FLiNaK
salt impregnated into graphite bulk when no external load is applied.
With increase of external force, the SCA has been transformed from
one region to another because of the unbalanced squeeze interaction
between graphite and salt. During the application of the external
load, the graphite would easily fracture in the SCA, where a smaller
grain size, poorer crystallinity of graphite and a larger grain size,
better crystallinity of FLiNaK salt appear. Meanwhile, the crystal
orientation of the FLiNaK salt indicates that the external load force
makes the ordered stacking of the crystal grains of the FLiNaK salt
impregnated into the graphite better. However, the ordered stacking
of the crystal grains of the FLiNaK salt near position 5 is better
than that near position 8 during the application of the external load.
Meanwhile, crystal orientation analysis of graphite and salt further
indicated that the larger grain size of FLiNaK salt would lead to
the fracture of graphite. These findings will help reveal the interaction
between the graphite microstructure and the molten salt and be conducive
to explain the change of mechanical properties of graphite after molten
salt impregnation, which will promote the fabrication of high-performance
graphite and safe operation of the MSR.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation
The research materials in this experiment
are the medium-grained grade NBG-18 from SGL Carbon Group, Germany.
The size of graphite impregnated with the FLiNaK salt is 20 ×
2.5 × 2 mm3. First, the graphite sample needs to be
ground and polished. Before impregnation, these were marked by a laser
marking machine and then cleaned with acetone, ethyl alcohol, and
deionized water as well as dried in vacuum for 2 h at 120 °C
to remove the absorbed water. The molten salt was used as a eutectic
mixture of LiF, NaF, and KF (46.5 mol % LiF/11.5 mol % NaF/42 mol
% KF).32,33 The melting point of FLiNaK salt was estimated
to be 454.0 ± 0.2 °C. Before being impregnated into the
molten salt, the graphite samples were degassed using a device. The
autoclave was charged with argon gas, and the pressure was kept at
2 atm. The graphite samples were removed from the molten salt after
20 h of impregnation. The pressure in the pressure vessel was maintained
until the pressure vessel had cooled to room temperature. The weight
of the graphite samples before and after the impregnation test was
measured using an analytical balance, which was located in the glovebox.
The weight gain of graphite samples is calculated to be (8.59 ±
0.2) wt % by weighing the mass change of graphite before and after
the FLiNaK salt impregnation experiment.

Characterizations
SEM observations were carried out
using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (LEO 1530 VP).
In situ tensile synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed
at the BL14B134 beamline in Shanghai Synchrotron
Radiation Facility (SSRF) at a wavelength of 0.06887 nm.35 The in situ tensile XRD experimental value was
measured by the transmission mode, and the graphite NBG-18 was adhered
to the already fabricated fixture model and placed at the vertical
of the X-ray incidence direction. Two-dimensional XRD patterns were
acquired by a MarCCD at a distance of ∼278.65 mm vertically
from the sample with an exposure time of 20 s. The XRD patterns were
analyzed using FIT2D software and displayed in scattering vector q (q = 4π sin θ/λ, where
θ is half of the diffraction angle and λ is the wavelength
of incident X-ray) coordinates. The morphology and element distribution
of the graphite impregnated with FLiNaK salt were obtained using a
LEO 1530VP SEM system and X-ray EDS. Salt distribution after the fracture
of the graphite sample impregnated with FLiNaK salt was measured using
an EPMA (EPMA-1720). The tensile fracture surface of the graphite
sample impregnated with FLiNaK salt was cut by a wire saw and scraped
with a stainless steel knife to produce a smooth and fresh surface
for EPMA observation. Defect changes of graphite impregnated with
FLiNaK salt before and after the tensile fracture were measured using
a Raman spectrometer with a 473 nm excitation laser. Calibration of
the spectrometer was undertaken with silicon before the measurements.
A full spectrum from 200 to 2000 cm–1 was acquired
during each measurement with an acquisition time of 10 s.
