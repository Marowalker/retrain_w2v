Herein, we demonstrate
the fabrication of Bi(0)-doped bismuth oxyhalide
solid solution films for the removal of trace organic pollutants (TrOPs)
in water. With the advantage of a viscous AlOOH sol, very high loadings
(75 wt %) of bismuth oxyhalides were embedded within the thin films
and calcined at 500 °C to develop porous alumina composite coatings.
Various concentrations of Bi(0) doping were tested for their photocatalytic
activity. Seven TrOPs including iopromide (IPRM), iohexol (IHX), iopamidol
(IPMD), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), carbamazepine, venlafaxine, and bezafibrate
(BZF) were selected for this study based on their occurrence and detection
in effluents and surface waters worldwide. In all tests, with the
exception of IPRM, 3% Bi(0)-doped BiOCl0.875Br0.125 showed highest activity, which can be attributed to its unique,
highly organized, and compact morphology besides its well-matched
energy band positions. Although IPMD, IHX, IPRM, and SMX are susceptible
to photolysis, still the photocatalytic activity significantly augmented
the removal of all tested compounds. In addition, analysis of the
surface charge excluded electrostatic interactions and confirmed the
ion-exchange adsorption mechanism for the high degradation rate of
BZF in the presence of bismuth oxyhalides.

==== Body
Introduction
Rapid economic growth,
intensified industrialization, and acceleration
in population growth rate have led to an increase in the use of pharmaceuticals,
personal care products, pesticides, and herbicides. Most of these
consumed compounds are only moderately or poorly metabolized in the
human body, whereas others are excreted totally intact,1 which results in the occurrence of trace organic
pollutants (TrOPs) in wastewater and in drinking water sources and
consequently in agricultural crops. In addition, most pharmaceuticals
resist typical microbial degradation,2 and
thus, both wastewater and water treatment facilities are inefficient
or only partially effectual in the removal of TrOPs.2c,3 These persistent pharmaceuticals and their mixtures are found in
the environment at concentrations of ng L–1 to μg
L–1 levels in secondary effluents and receiving
surface waters worldwide. In this context, Rodil et al.4 (2012) found that 19 out of 53 different emerging
pollutants present in raw wastewater were at a concentration greater
than 0.1 μg L–1; 11 of them persisted even
at wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents at a concentration
greater than 0.1 μg L–1. In another study,
Verlicchi et al. (2012)5 discovered that
the concentrations of contaminants can be as high as 57 μg L–1 (for tramadol) in WWTP secondary effluents.

In countries where water resources are limited, there is a great
demand for the recycle and reuse of industrial and domestic wastewater.
As a result, TrOPs enter the aquatic environment and eventually affect
drinking water sources. The acute and chronic effects of pharmaceutical
compounds on the ecosystem and on human health are not yet fully understood.6 Consequently, there is a growing need for effectual,
cost-effective, and environmentally benign water treatment technologies.
An emerging technology for the destruction of persistent organic pollutants
is photocatalysis. Titanium oxide (TiO2) is the most widely
studied photocatalyst7 in photodecomposing
TrOPs in surface water8 and in WWTP effluents.9 TiO2 is rather limited as it can utilize
only a narrow portion of the solar spectrum.10

Recently, bismuth-based compounds have shown potential as
photocatalysts
because of their efficacious absorbance in the UVA and visible ranges
and their nontoxic nature. In fact, bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX; X =
Cl, Br, and I) have evolved as a new family of visible light-driven
photocatalysts. The layered heterojunction structure of BiOX crystals
can provide large enough space to polarize the related atoms and orbitals.
The induced dipole can separate the photogenerated hole–electron
pairs efficiently, enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In addition,
indirect transition band gap can reduce the undesired recombination
probability.11 To increase their photocapacity,
numerous approaches were considered. These include doping, coupling,
sensitization, formation of defects, exposing active facets, use of
cocatalysts, graphene coupling, etc.12 It
has been proved both theoretically and experimentally that these mixed
bismuth oxyhalide solid solutions are more active in comparison with
their monohalide counterparts. We also reported a very simple and
practical approach for fabricating mixed bismuth oxyhalide solid solutions
at ambient conditions.13 It has established
the high degradation rate of rhodamine B using BiOX (BiOCl0.875Br0.125) under visible light.13 In another study, the high oxidation potential of the BiOX hole
hvb+ resulted in direct bacterial oxidation
of Escherichia coli by its adsorption
onto the catalyst surface.14

Much
effort has been expended to immobilize catalysts and photocatalysts
on thin films mainly to avoid the problems associated with handling
catalyst suspensions. Little is known about the effects of the coating
characteristics of bismuth-based sol–gel thin films on their
photocatalytic activity toward the removal of micropollutants. The
goal of this study is to demonstrate the ability of bismuth oxyhalide
thin films doped with various bismuth(0) concentrations to photocatalytically
degrade iopromide (IPRM), iohexol (IHX), iopamidol (IPMD), sulfamethoxazole
(SMX), carbamazepine (CBZ), venlafaxine (VLX), and bezafibrate (BZF)
in water. These compounds (Supporting Information Table S1 and Figure S1) were selected because of their frequent
detection in WWTPs, surface waters, and groundwaters.15 This paper also addresses electrostatic interactions of
the TrOP-immobilized catalysts (measured by zeta potential obtained
from streaming potential measurements) on the photodegradation of
target pollutants.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication and Analysis
of Bismuth-Doped Bismuth Oxyhalide
Particles
In this study, an easy, scalable, and general approach
for fabricating bismuth-doped bismuth oxyhalide solid solutions immobilized
on thin films for solar enhanced photocatalytic degradation of TrOPs
in water was demonstrated. The solid solutions of mixed bismuth oxyhalides
(BiOClxBr1–x) were synthesized at room temperature. Among several possible
compositions, BiOCl0.875Br0.125 was selected
taking into consideration its superior photocapacity as realized in
our previous study.13 A further improvement
in the harvested photoefficiency was achieved via doping of BiOCl0.875Br0.125 with Bi(0). To benchmark the efficacy
of our developed materials, a commercially available TiO2 (P25) photocatalyst was also examined.

Morphologies of these
powders (BiOCl0.875Br0.125, 1% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125, 2% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125, and 3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125) along with that of TiO2 (for comparison)
were investigated by extra-high-resolution scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Figure 1). The
formation of microspheres (∼2–8 μm) was evident
for all bismuth powders, which are composed of very thin (∼10–20
nm) porous nanosheets (magnified portion on 1% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125 particles; Supporting Information Figure S2). The size of the particles gradually
increased with increasing the doping of Bi(0), from 1 to 3%. Interestingly,
relatively higher Bi(0) doping allowed the sheets to be arranged in
a more compact and ordered fashion, which can be correlated with the
electrostatic interaction between Bi3+ and BH4– ions. However, higher amounts of BH4– ions and high (4%) loading of Bi(0) shattered
the structure of the microparticles and resulted in broken particles
(Supporting Information Figure S3).

of the particles: (a,b) TiO2 (P25),
(c,d) BiOCl0.875Br0.125, (e,f) 1% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125, (g,h) 2% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125, and (i,j) 3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125.

In comparison, the dimension
of the TiO2 particles was
found to be ∼20–40 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the TiO2 particles show the presence of mainly the anatase
(86.4%) form with small portion of rutile (13.6%) crystallites. All
BiOClxBr1–x particles provided typical peaks for BiOCl0.875Br0.125 as shown in Figure 2. Formation of Bi(0) was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analysis, and representative spectra are given in Figure
S4 (Supporting Information).16 Herein, Bi(0) doping was varied from 0 to 3
mol % with respect to BiOCl0.875Br0.125 and
the sample was designated as 1–3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125.

Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas
and the
band gaps of the powders are given in Table 1. It was observed that the surface areas
of the bismuth oxyhalides remain almost unchanged (∼27–30
m2/g). Interestingly, the absorption edge (λmax) of BiOCl0.875Br0.125 was shifted
toward longer wavelengths with increasing % Bi(0) doping, as shown
in Table 1. Consequently,
the band gap values were also decreased with an increase in the Bi(0)
content. It is well known that semiconductor materials with the absorption
edge in the longer wavelength (visible region) and lower band gap
values show better visible light-driven photocatalysis.17 This result motivated us to study the photocatalytic
efficiency of Bi(0)-doped BiOCl0.875Br0.125 toward
the decomposition of TrOPs.

Characterization of Bismuth-Doped
Bismuth Oxyhalide Thin Films
The synthesized BiOX powders
(75 wt %) were loaded on alumina-based
matrices (25 wt %) for forming thin films as described in the Experimental Section. A highly viscous but stable
AlOOH sol helped to disperse these high amounts of bismuth oxyhalide
particles within the sol, which was further deposited on a glass surface,
followed by a concomitant heat treatment to obtain a stable film (Supporting Information Figure S5). During the
calcinations process, AlOOH was converted into γ-Al2O3.18 Pure alumina films and
TiO2 (75 wt %)-loaded films were also synthesized for comparative
photocatalytic studies. Morphologies of the films were studied by
high-resolution SEM and are presented in Figure 3. Pure alumina films (Figure 3a) show a typical porous microstructure of
alumina, and the TiO2-loaded films reveal the loading of
TiO2 particles within the alumina surface. The SEM image
of one representative BiOX film (3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125) is shown in Figure 3c–e. The image (Figure 3c) from the top surface of the film shows
that the bismuth oxyhalide particles are well distributed throughout
the surface of the composite film. The higher magnification image
(Figure 3d) clearly
indicates the presence of bismuth oxyhalide particles within the alumina
support. Cross-sectional image of the film is presented in Figure 3e, revealing a thickness
of the composite films of ∼3 μm. The stability of the
coatings was tested by the ASTM-D3359 method, and the adhesion of
coatings was found to be very high (class 5B).

top surfaces of the films: (a) alumina,

Zeta Potential of Bismuth-Doped
Bismuth Oxyhalide Thin Films
Electrostatic attraction and
repulsion in aqueous systems are driven
by the surface charge and thus by the solid surface zeta potential.19 Opposite charges at a certain pH indicate that
electrostatic forces contribute to the adhesion of water constituents
(e.g., organic molecules) to the film layer.20 In addition, zeta potential measurements can imply whether film
deposition was uniform along the sample21 and whether the film is stable in an aqueous environment.22 The zeta potential (ζ) as a function of
pH for the reference samples (i.e., uncoated, Al2O3-coated, and TiO2-coated microscope glass slides)
and bismuth oxyhalide-deposited samples is presented in Figure 4. Table 2 summarizes the points of zero charge (PZCs)
of the examined samples.

Figure 4 Zeta potential vs pH of various types of photocatalytic
films and
references (Al2O3 and glass).

 	glass	Al2O3_ref	TiO2	pure	3% Bi-doped	
PZC	2.7	8.2	4.3	5.1	5.0	
The uncoated glass sample was found to be the most
acidic (PZC
2.7, Table 2) owing
to the high density of surface silanol groups. The PZC value for the
reference Al2O3-coated glass slide was 8.2 (Table 2), which is in the
range for Al2O3.23 The TiO2-coated sample resulted in a PZC of 4.3 with
a slightly amphoteric behavior (Figure 4) as expected from the literature.24 PZCs of bismuth oxyhalide samples with lowest and highest
degrees of Bi dopant were 5.1 (BiOCl0.875Br0.125) and 5.0 (3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125).
The samples BiOCl0.875Br0.125 and 3% Bi-doped
BiOCl0.875Br0.125 show similar data curves as
expected. The doping of 1–3
w/w % Bi to the bismuth oxyhalide is not expected to affect surface
charge since the concentration is low but mostly as the doped Bi is
incorporated in the lattice structure and should not migrate to the
photocatalyst outer surface as mentioned above. Upon the deposition
of the photocatalytic films, the sol–gel solution contains
25% Al2O3 and 75% bismuth oxyhalide, giving
a homogenously mixed coating. In case of partial dissolution of this
homogenous (25% Al/75% Bi) coating at the measuring conditions, a
more acidic glass surface will be exposed.

Photocatalytic Activity
of Bismuth-Doped Bismuth Oxyhalide Thin
Films
The fabricated films were tested for the photodegradation
of certain TrOPs under solar light. Several studies report the adsorption
of organic compounds on the semiconductor surface as a critical step
for photodegradation, whereas others suggest that adsorption may increase
the reaction rate but is not essential in the presence of hydroxyl
radicals.25 A distinction should be made
between dark adsorption to the catalyst surface and adsorption
occurring in the course of the photocatalytic process (photoadsorption)
while the catalyst is exposed to radiation.7

Dark adsorption of the TrOPs to the examined photocatalytic
thin films (i.e., after a 60 min equilibration time) was found to
be insignificant for all contaminants except for BZF. BZF is a lipid
regulator used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Because of its
wide use, unmetabolized BZF is released to the environment with potential
toxic effects.26 Interestingly, BZF, which
is negatively charged (pKa = 3.8, Table S1) and hydrophobic (log D 1.8–2.8, Table S1), displayed
an increasing dark adsorption with increasing Bi doping percentage
to the bismuth oxyhalide samples but not to TiO2 (Figure 5). According to the
measured PZC of the TiO2-coated sample (Table 2), electrostatic repulsion between
the negatively charged TiO2 photocatalyst and BZF is expected.
However, the isoelectric points of bismuth oxyhalide samples are also
lower than those in experimental conditions (water pH ≈ 5.5)
(Table 2), and consequently
electrostatic attraction forces between BZF and these samples may
not be the main mechanism. Furthermore, the pure Al2O3-coated sample shows a negligible adsorption of BZF in the
dark, which confirms that the adsorption process is not driven by
electrostatic attraction.

Figure 5 Degree of adsorption of BZF measured in the
dark prior to irradiation.

A hydrophobic interaction can be considered as a possible
explanation.
Lester et al. (2014) studied the particulate BiOCl0.875Br0.125 photocatalyst for the removal of four micropollutants:
CBZ, ibuprofen, BZF, and propranolol.27 A similar adsorption conduct was realized for the negatively charged
BZF, whereas dark adsorption of propranolol (positively charged) was
negligible. The hydrophobic nature of BZF cannot be the main reason
for this favorable interaction as CBZ (a neutral and hydrophobic compound)
did not exhibit significant dark adsorption to the bismuth oxyhalide
films in this work as well as to the particulate BiOCl0.875Br0.125 photocatalyst.24 It
was suggested that ion exchange is the dominant adsorption mechanism
for charged compounds. In this case, the adsorbing phase is the positively
charged [Bi2O2]2+ layer, while the
halogen atoms (i.e., Cl–/Br–)
function as counter ions. Although most TrOPs do not exhibit dark
adsorption to the thin-film-coated catalyst surface, a sorption–desorption
mechanism may occur under light irradiation when the catalyst is “active”.

The photocatalytic efficiency of BiOCl0.875Br0.125 films doped with different concentrations of metallic bismuth toward
degradation of the chosen TrOPs under solar simulator irradiation
is presented in Figure 6. IPMD, IHX, IPRM, and particularly SMX are susceptible to photolysis
(solar light without the photocatalyst—Al2O3_ref sample) with 25 ± 4, 30 ± 6, 18 ± 1, and
44 ± 0.7% removal, respectively. However, exposure to light significantly
increased the destruction of all of the abovementioned compounds.
The molecules CBZ, VLX, and BZF were found to be notably stable toward
exposure to radiation but showed meaningful degradation due to the
photocatalytic effect in the following order BZF > VLX > CBZ.
Particularly,
a high rate of degradation was realized for BZF with 70–79%
removal with the bismuth oxyhalide films. In this case, the importance
of dark adsorption was found to be correlated with the efficacy of
the photocatalytic degradation. Considerable adsorption of rhodamine
B (pKa = 4.2 and log D = 0.5 at pH 5) to BiOCl0.875Br0.125 compared
to TiO2 facilitated enhanced degradation of free rhodamine
B, indicating the significance of close proximity between active sites
on the catalyst and the decomposing dissolved molecule.28 On the basis of literature support and our observed
results, it is suggested that initially adsorption of TrOPs on the
surface of the films occurs, which is followed by the decomposition
of the TrOPs under solar light illumination, as shown in the scheme
(Figure 7).

IPMD, IHX, IPRM, SMX, CBZ, VLX, and BZF by BiOCl0.875Br0.125 and Bi-doped BiOCl0.875Br0.125 films
compared to TiO2 and pure Al2O3 film
following 60 min of irradiation.

Figure 7 Schematic illustration of the possible mechanism for the photocatalytic
decomposition of TrOPs by Bi0–BiOCl0.875Br0.125.

Amongst the bismuth oxyhalide-deposited films, the sample
3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125 showed the highest
destruction rate
for most of the tested compounds, except for IPMD, where TiO2 outperformed the bismuth thin film-coated surfaces. The highest
efficiencies of 3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125 can be correlated with the lowest band gap (Table 1) as well as with the highly organized and
compact morphology of the particles as observed in the SEM images
(Figure 2). However,
further increase of the bismuth doping (4%) did not result in improved
performance (data not shown) because of the resulting broken microstructure
(Supporting Information Figure S3).

Conclusions
In summary, we have described the synthesis of stable Bi(0)-doped
bismuth oxyhalide thin films and their application as photocatalytic
substrates for the removal of TrOPs. Diverse coatings of BiOCl0.875Br0.125 with variable Bi(0) loadings were synthesized.
The notable efficiencies of the 3% Bi–BiOCl0.875Br0.125 films toward degradation of the selected TrOPs
under solar irradiation can be correlated with their unique morphology
and with the well-matched band positions. The negatively charged hydrophobic
compound BZF exhibited extremely strong affinity to the bismuth oxyhalide
films and high degradation rate accordingly. Analysis of the surface
charge excluded electrostatic interactions between the compound and
the bismuth films. This result rather strengthened the previously
suggested ion-exchange adsorption mechanism owing to the unique structure
of the bismuth oxyhalides.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (ASB) Al[OCH(CH3)C2H5]3, bismuth(III) nitrate
pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O),
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB,
≥99%), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 25 wt % in water),
and glacial acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Seven TrOPs
were selected for this study, based on their physicochemical properties
(Supporting Information Table S1).15 All standards (purity > 99%) were obtained
from
Sigma-Aldrich, except for IPRM and IPMD (European Pharmacopeia reference
standards, France). Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving in
deionized (DI) water (Direct-Q3 UV system, Millipore-France). LC-grade
methanol and water were purchased from Bio-Lab (Jerusalem, Israel).

Synthesis of an AlOOH Sol
ASB (Al[OCH(CH3)C2H5]3, 20 g) was placed in a 250
mL round-bottom flask, followed by the addition of 146 g of boiled
water while stirring under reflux conditions (∼82 °C).
After 1 h of reflux, 0.7 mL of concentrated HCl was added. Then, the
sol was stirred vigorously under reflux for 48 h. After completion
of the reaction, an equivalent wt % of AlO1.5 within the
sol was determined to be 2.45. Part of the sol was concentrated to
about 7–8 equivalent wt % AlO1.5 content by distilling
off the solvent (i.e., secondary butanol and water) using a rotary
evaporator. A stoichiometric amount of methanol was then added to
the sol to maintain the AlO1.5 content at 4 wt %.

Syntheses
of BiOX Powders
Bismuth nitrate (14.69 g)
was dissolved in DI water (50 mL) and glacial acetic acid (40 mL)
in a 250 mL beaker and stirred at room temperature for 30 min until
a clear, transparent solution was formed. Then, CTAB (1.38 g, dissolved
in 25 mL of ethanol and 10 mL of water) and CTAC (33.92 g of 25 wt
% aqueous solution) were added to the above solution in one batch.
Finally, sodium borohydride [11.456, 22.912, and 34.364 mg for Bi(0)
doping of 1, 2, and 3%, respectively] and ethanol (20 mL) were added
to the reaction mixture, which was then stirred for an additional
60 min at room temperature. The precipitate thus formed was filtered
and washed five times with ethanol (50 mL) and five times with water
(200 mL) to remove the nonreactive organic species. The off-white
solid was then dried (in air) and became ready for use. In the case
of pure BiOCl0.875Br0.125, the procedure was
same except the addition of NaBH4.

Preparation of an AlOOH/BiOX
Composite Sol
BiOX (480
mg) was ultrasonicated in 2 mL of 1-propanol for ∼1–2
min, followed by the addition of 4 mL of 4 wt % AlOOH sol, and then
again ultrasonicated for ∼1–2 min. The sol became highly
viscous and showed gel-like appearance.

Coating Procedure
A microscope glass slide (25 mm ×
75 mm) was coated with the composite AlOOH/BiOX sol. A volume of 2–3
drops of this sol was placed on the glass slide, and coating was done
by a wire-bar coating deposition method, using a K101 K Control Coater
from RK Print Coat Instruments Ltd.29 The
films were dried at room temperature for ∼30 min and allowed
to heat at 500 °C for 10 h. The rate of heating was maintained
at 1 °C/min. The adhesion of the film was tested by the standard
method (ASTM D3359).30

Characterizations
Sample morphology was observed by
an extra-high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Magellan TM
400L). XRD patterns were collected by using Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE.
Band gaps were estimated from the analysis of diffuse reflectance
spectra obtained from a UV–visible spectrometer with an attached
integrating sphere (JASCO V-650 Series ISV-722). Surface area was
determined by N2 sorption analysis (BET method) using NOVA-1200e
instrument.

Zeta Potential Measurement
Zeta
potentials of TiO2, BiOCl0.875Br0.125, and 1–3%
Bi-doped BiOCl0.875Br0.125-coated glass films
(25 mm × 75 mm) were determined from streaming potential measurements
using an electrokinetic analyzer equipped with conductivity and pH
electrodes (SurPASS3, Anton Paar GmbH, Austria). The coated glass
samples were mounted to a clamping cell opposite to a reference sample
(polypropylene foil). A spacer separates the sample and the reference
to form a rectangular capillary with a gap of approximately 100 μm.
A 0.001 M KCl solution was used as the background electrolyte, and
the pH was adjusted with 0.05 M HCl/NaOH to identify the PZC (i.e.,
the pH at which the electrokinetic charge density diminishes and thus
ζ = 0 mV). Before starting the measurement, the samples were
carefully rinsed with the measuring electrolyte. Zeta potential was
calculated from the streaming potentials using the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski
equation.

Photocatalytic Activity
Coated slides were immersed
in a 90 mm × 50 mm Pyrex glass dish containing 30 mL of aqueous
solution (DI water) spiked with seven TrOPs at initial concentrations
of 100 μg L–1 (each compound). For each experiment,
3–4 slides were used with a surface of 18.5 cm2.
Water height above the sample was ∼4.7 mm. The examined solution
was stirred for 60 min in the dark to ensure the adsorption/desorption
equilibrium of the TrOPs on the catalyst prior to irradiation. The
solution was then irradiated under a solar simulator for 60 min, with
gentle stirring, during which samples of 0.3 mL were taken periodically.

Irradiation experiments were carried out with a 150 W ozone-free
Xe arc lamp solar simulator (Sciencetech Inc., SS150W, Canada) achieving
a consistent incident irradiation of ∼500 W m–2 integrated between 280 and 950 nm, including an UVA irradiance of
∼21.5 W m–2 and an UVB irradiance of 0.9
W m–2, as previously described by Mamane et al.
(2014).31

The TrOPs were analyzed
by high-performance liquid chromatography
(Agilent 1100 series; ACE-RP phenyl column 2.1 mm × 250 mm) coupled
with a mass spectrometer (Q-TofMS, Waters Premier). The column temperature
was 40 °C, the flow rate was 0.5 mL min–1,
and the injected sample volume was 100 μL. The mobile phase
consisted of water (A) and methanol (B) and was adjusted to pH 3 with
formic acid. The eluent gradient started with 10% eluent B for 1 min,
followed by a 4 min linear gradient to 90% B, a 5 min isocratic elution
at 90% B, and a 2 min linear gradient back to 10% B, which was maintained
for 4 min for equilibration. The Q-Tof MS was operated in the positive
mode, with a limit of quantification of 0.1 μg L–1.

All experiments were performed in triplicate, and relative
standard
deviations were less than 10%. The photocatalytic efficiency was expressed
as percent removal: 1  where C0 is the
