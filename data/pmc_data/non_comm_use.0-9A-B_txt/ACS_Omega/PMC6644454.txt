Three-dimensional
(3D) biodegradable and biomimetic porous scaffolds
are ideal frameworks for skin tissue engineering. In this study, hybrid
constructs of 3D scaffolds were successfully fabricated by the freeze-drying
method from combinations of the type I collagen (Col) and synthetic
poly(lactic acid) (PLLA) or polycaprolactone (PCL). Four different
groups of 3D porous scaffolds including PCL, PCL–Col, PCL–PLLA,
and PCL–PLLA–Col were fabricated and systematically
characterized by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adipose
tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) were seeded in all
scaffolds, and the viability, proliferation, and adhesion of the cells
were investigated using dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay and SEM. The results showed that scaffolds containing Col, particularly
PCL–PLLA–Col scaffold, with pore sizes close to 400
nm and being sufficiently interconnected, have significantly greater
potential (p < 0.01) for encouraging AT-MSCs adhesion
and growth. The PCL–PLLA provided a mechanically stronger mesh
support, and the type I Col microsponges encouraged excellent cell
adhesion and tissue formation. The scaffold with the best properties
could be an appropriate functional candidate for the preparation of
artificial skin constructs.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Tissue engineering (TE)
provides a promising alternative approach
to repair and regenerate the injured or malfunctioned tissues with
biologically and mechanically appropriate autologous replacement organ
or tissue.1 In this regard, TE is employed
to help the patient’s body and produce materials which can
mimic the body’s in vivo tissue conditions. In addition, TE
strategies showed promising results for improving the quality of regenerative
therapeutics. The master plan for TE is the isolation of specific
cells from patient,2−4 then seeding the isolated cells on a desired biomimetic
scaffold and administration of growth media, and eventually grafting
back the construct into the same patient.5he first item in TE, as mentioned previously, is the cells. Although,
a few different cells have been used in TE purposes, stem cells could
be the best candidates because of their unique properties such as
self-renewal and differentiation. There are three main types of stem
cells, including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells
(PSCs), and adult stem cells.4 The embryonic
stem cells show pluripotency which is ideal for regenerative therapies
of all cell types of the body, but ethical issues related to the destruction
of embryos, propensity for becoming turmeric after transplantation,
and their limited availability are the main factors hampering their
routine use. Induced PSCs (iPSCs) are another group, which have pluripotency
potential. Because iPSCs originated from reprograming of somatic cells,6 the embryonic stem cells’ moral issues
are not important in this case, but their in vivo administration concerns
about their becoming tumorogenic. In comparison, adult stem cells,
in particular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are the best candidates
for TE because they are available in adulthood, without any ethical
concerns and are multipotent. Recent in vitro studies have reported
that MSCs could be extracted from various sources, including bone
marrow, cord blood, adipose, and so on. The second item for a TE process
is the use of macro–nano structured porous scaffolds, for supporting
initial cell adhesion, and subsequently successful tissue preparation.
Six methods were established for the fabrication of three-dimensional
(3D) hybrid scaffolds including fiber extrusion and bonding, gas foaming,
3D printing, phase separation, porogen leaching, and emulsion freeze-drying.7 The 3D scaffolds usually are built from synthetic
or natural polymers, mimicking extracellular matrix (ECM) for directing
the proliferation and spread of seeded cells in vitro and in vivo.
It is essential for a scaffold to be biocompatible as well as biodegradable.8

Nowadays, the number of the patients who
have been suffering from
skin damages such as burning or chronic wounds is dramatically increasing,
and thus, there is an unmet need for introducing effective and prompt
wound healing strategies.9 In this regard,
donor sit limitation and morbidity, reduction of the surgical procedure
are main limitations of skin substitution.10 In the last decade, TE as a novel strategy for skin regeneration
is holding a great promise because of the excellent design and fabrication
of tunable living replacements.

There are different types of
biopolymers for ECM mimicking; one
of them is collagen (Col) which showed promising results in treating
skin burns, wounds, and cosmetics.11 Up
to now, various hybrid scaffold types have been developed for skin
TE. The ultimate goal of these scaffolds is to promote cell adhesion
and proliferation; therefore, Col and gelatin are best options for
hybrid scaffolds fabrication.12 However,
these biopolymers do not have enough mechanical strength supporting
cell seeding and post transplantation physical supports. To solve
this problem, a number of biodegradable synthetic polymers with appropriate
mechanical properties can be used for the fabrication of porous scaffolds
such as poly(glycolic acid), poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid), and poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA).8,13 Additionally, porosity and interconnected architecture of 3D scaffolds
is necessary for ideal functionality.14,15 The aim of
this study was to design and fabricate Col hybrid scaffolds for skin
TE. In this study, four types of 3D porous scaffolds were prepared,
using combinations of polycaprolactone (PCL), PLLA, and Col and then
characterized by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). The cell adhesion, biocompatibility, and
cell proliferation of fabricated scaffolds were studied by SEM and
dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Our results
revealed that scaffolds containing Col in particular PCL–PLLA–Col
interconnected with pore sizes close to 400 nm showed significantly
greater potential (p < 0.01) for encouraging adipose
tissue derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) adhesion and growth. The PCL–PLLA
provided a mechanically strong mesh support and the type I Col microsponges
encouraged cell adhesion and tissue formation.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Synthesized
Polymers by 1H NMR
In this work, both PCL polymers
and PCL–PLLA
copolymers were synthesized using ring-opening polymerization (ROP)
of caprolactone in the presence of PLLA. NMR spectroscopy was employed
to study the chemical structure of synthesized polymers. Figure 1 shows the corresponding
NMR spectra. According to 1H NMR spectrum of PCL–PLLA,
those three peaks which are located at 4.10 ppm (O–CH2–(CH2)3–CH2–C=O),
2.26 ppm (O–CH2–(CH2)3–CH2–C=O), and 1.53 ppm (O–CH2–(CH2)3–CH2–C=O) are related to the protons of PCL, and the peaks
at 5.1 ppm (O–(CH)CH3–C=O) and 1.6
ppm (O–(CH)CH3–C=O) are attributed
to methylene hydrogens in lactide.

PCL–PLLA, showing
their chemical structure.

2.2 FTIR Results
The FTIR spectrum for
PCL, PCL–Col, PCL–PLLA, and PCL–PLLA–Col
polymers are shown in Figure 2. The Col structure is made of three main amino acids, including
proline, glycine, and hydroxyl proline. The peptide bond connects
those amino acids, in FTIR spectrums (b,d), the picks in 3600, 3100,
1700–1600, 1600–1500, and 1400–1300 correspond
to NH2, C–H, C=O, and NH, C–N, respectively.

and (d) PCL–PLLA–Col.

2.3 Fabrication and Properties of 3D Scaffolds
Desired scaffolds in TE are providing a porous structure, in which
the porosity ≥70% as well as interconnected pores allowing
cell growth is ideal.16 In this work, four
scaffold types including two Col blended have been prepared, in the
form of 3D.

Our scaffolds had porous structures with a heterogeneous
pore size. Figure 3a–d shows SEM micrographs of cross section and pore sizes
of PCL, PCL–Col, PCL–PLLA, and PCL–PLLA–Col
scaffolds, respectively. Their pores were formed applying the freeze-drying
technique. According to previous reports, the morphology of the pores
is dependent on the freezing temperature of the polymers prior to
lyophilization.17 In this study, microporous
structures were obtained when a mixture of Col solution and polymer/copolymer
were frozen at −50 °C. A desired scaffold for skin TE
should present excellent porosity (more than 90%) as well as desired
microstructure 100–200 μm mean pore diameters. Previous
studies showed that the freeze-drying method has the potential for
preparing >90% porosity,18 which was
employed
in this work. The pore sizes of the obtained scaffolds are summarized
in Figure 4a,b. The
incorporation of Col into the PCL scaffold resulted in a decrease
in the size of micrometric pores, also the insertion of PLLA in PCL–Col
and PCL–PLLA scaffolds caused more reduction in micro pore
sizes; finally, Col blending forced excessive decrease in micro pore
sizes of the PCL–PLLA–Col scaffold (Figure 4).

a heterogeneous pore size, (a) PCL, (b) PCL–Col,
(c) PCL–PLLA, and (d) PCL–PLLA–Col.

Figure 4 Pore sizes of PCL, PCL–Col, PCL–PLLA, and
PCL–PLLA–Col
scaffolds in (a) micrometer and (b) nanometer scales. The incorporation
of Col into PCL and PCL–PLLA scaffolds decreases the size of
micrometric pores and increases the size of nanometric pores.

2.4 Characterization
of AT-MSCs
The third
important factor in TE is the cell; as previously mentioned, researchers
have used keratinocytes or fibroblasts for skin TE. In this study,
we have utilized AT-MSCs which were isolated according to our previous
works.3 We have utilized flow cytometry
analysis of markers CD90, CD105, CD34, and CD45 for characterization
of AT-MSCs. It was found that our cells express CD90 and CD105 on
their surfaces (positive staining for CD90 and CD105) but did not
express CD34 or CD45 (negative for CD34 and CD45) (Figure 5), which confirmed their identity.

Figure 5 Immunophenotyping
of AT-MSCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) which showed positive staining for (a) CD90 and (d) CD105 and
negative for (b) CD34 and (c) CD45.

2.5 Cell Viability
The in vitro study
of the cytocompatibility of 3D scaffolds was performed by culturing
AT-MSCs on the scaffolds. The viability of AT-MSCs cultured on scaffolds
were determined 3, 5, and 9 days post seeding by the colorimetric
MTT assay; AT-MSCs cultured in tissue cell culture plates (TCPs) were
set as the positive control. Figure 6 shows that the cells that survived in each scaffold
and all scaffolds showed enough cytocompatibility. Interestingly,
the scaffolds containing Col in particular PCL–PLLA–Col
showed significant higher cytocompatibility represented by higher
ODs in MTT assay (p < 0.01). In the previous studies,
fibroblasts and keratinocytes were employed for preparing artificial
skin constructs,12,19−21 but in this
study, we utilized subcutaneous AT-MSCs which have morphology and
properties similar to fibroblasts and also have the potential for
keratinocyte differentiation.22 MSCs are
recruited into skin wounds and take a part in wound healing by differentiation
into different skin cells.23 The AT-MSCs
were seeded into four scaffold types, and the MTT results showed that
the best cell adhesion encourager may possibly be the PCL–PLLA–Col.
Cells on the TCPs grew less, which could be due to the lack of sufficient
space for further cell growth, and this illustrates the importance
of porous 3D scaffolds in TE.

PCL–Col, PCL–PLLA,
and PCL–PLLA–Col scaffolds studied by the MTT assay.

2.6 SEM Micrographic
Visualization
The
surface of 3D scaffolds shows irregular pores with homogeneous distribution,
and a range of pore sizes was observed, in which this surface topography
could support optimal interaction between cells and scaffold surfaces
during the first week of culture (Figure 7a–h). Fibroblastic AT-MSCs adhered
on scaffolds and had an elongated spindled morphology with several
cytoplasmic extensions, and protrusions are obvious while extending
away from the central to the top of nearer pores. These observations
confirmed the cytocompatibility and the adhesive potential of our
scaffolds for AT-MSCs and their potential for supporting suitable
cell growth that could be useful in skin TE applications.

3 Conclusion
Taken together, the results of this study highlighted the desired
porous, cytocompatibility as well as adhesion and growth, encouraging
potential of the PCL–PLLA–Col scaffold which could be
applicable for preparing artificial skin constructs in skin regenerative
therapeutics. The PCL–PLLA provided a mechanically strong mesh
support, and the type I Col microsponges because of its water-uptake
properties encouraged cell adhesion and tissue formation. Furthermore,
in this study, it is shown that using the PCL–PLLA co-polymer
with Col led to the production of scaffolds with regular porosity,
which are suitable for uniform cellular proliferation on the scaffolds
surface, so it is a good structure for future works. These results
may help in preparing constructs applicable for skin TE.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 PCL Polymer and PCL–PLLA
Co-polymer
Synthesis
ε-Caprolactone (CL) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Co., Steinheim, Germany). For PCL polymer synthesis, we used the
ROP method and stannous octoate (Sn(Oct)2) (Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Co) was added as a catalyst. In the beginning, 10 g of CL
was heated up to 130 °C, consequently, 0.1 g (1 wt %) of Sn(Oct)2 was added for starting polymerization and this continued
under stirring conditions with N2 gas for 6 h (see Figure 8a). Next, the polymer
dissolved in chloroform (Merck Chemical Co) or dichloromethane (Merck
Chemical Co), and then the mixture precipitated in an excess of diethyl
ether in a cold bath.

Figure 8 (a) ROP of CL to PCL using heat and catalyst. (b) Fabrication
process
of porous scaffolds.

Like PCL polymer, the ROP method was employed using lactic
acid
and CL monomers. dl-lactide monomers were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Co., Steinheim, Germany). For PCL–PLLA co-polymer
synthesis, lactic acid and CL monomers with a ratio of 2.5 to 97.5
were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask. After increasing the temperature
to 140 °C under stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere, 0.1 g (1 wt
%) of Sn(Oct)2 was added for catalyzing the reaction. After
6 h, the obtained co-polymer was dissolved in chloroform or dichloromethane,
and then to remove excess catalyst and the unreacted monomers, the
mixture precipitated in an excess of diethyl ether in a cold bath
and left at room temperature for solvent evaporation.

4.2 Porous PCL and PCL–PLLA Scaffolds Synthesis
We utilized the emulsion freeze-drying technique for the fabrication
of highly porous PCL, PLLA scaffolds by creating a homogenized emulsion
of a PCL, PLLA polymer solution in 1,4-dioxane solvent and water mixture.
The PCL polymer solution and the PCL–PLLA co-polymer solution
(10–20 w/v %) was prepared by dissolving the polymeric blend
in 1,4-dioxane. The solutions were magnetically stirred at room temperature
for 24 h. Then, the emulsion was rapidly cooled to lock in the liquid
state structure. For this purpose, the polymer solution is transferred
to a suitable mold and placed at −80 °C for 12 h. In the
next step, the frozen emulsion is placed in a freeze-dryer system
(Telstar-LyoQuest) for 24 h under a vacuum of 12 Torr and a temperature
of −50 °C. Next, the solvent and water were removed by
this method, and porous PCL and PCL–PLLA scaffolds are obtained
(see Figure 8b).

4.3 Porous PCL–Col and PCL–PLLA–Col
Scaffolds Synthesis
PCL polymer and PCL–PLLA co-polymer
were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane solvent (in a final concentration of
10%). After dissolving PCL polymer and PCL–PLLA co-polymer
under magnetic stirring at room temperature for 24 h, Col type I with
a concentration of 10 mg/mL was dissolved in aqueous solution of acetic
acid and added to polymer solutions in 99.9:0.1 ratio, next 20 μL
of glutaraldehyde was added as a cross-linker under stirring conditions,
and then the emulsion was replaced in a proper frame and froze at
−80 °C for 12 h and next were placed in a freeze-dryer
system for 24 h for evaporation of solvents and pores formation. Finally,
porous PCL–Col and PCL–PLLA–Col scaffolds are
obtained.

4.4 Hydrogen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
To study the chemical structure of synthesized polymers (PCL–PLLA),
NMR spectroscopy was studied using the 1H NMR system (Bruker
spectra spin 400 MHz).

4.5 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
The structure of the fabricated scaffolds was
determined by utilizing
the FTIR spectroscopy. Each four types of the scaffolds including
PCL, PCL–PLLA, PCL–Col, and PCL–PLLA–Col
was mixed with potassium bromide and then pressed to disk. An FTIR
spectrometer (Equinox 55 LS 101, Bruker, Germany) was employed in
taking infrared spectra of aforementioned scaffolds in a certain range
(400–4000 cm–1).

4.6 In Vitro
Culturing and Characterization of
AT-MSCs
The desired stem cells for this study were isolated
from adipose tissue, according to our previous work.4 After isolation, the AT-MSCs were cultivated in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) medium containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), dexamethasone (Sigma), PenStrep (Gibco),
and other supplements; the media were replaced twice weekly. The AT-MSCs
(third passage) were plated at a density of 1 × 106 in six-well plates. After reaching the confluence the cells
were trypsinized, harvested and seeded into the scaffolds, and subsequently
stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin conjugated
antibodies against CD90, CD73, CD34, and CD45 antibodies at different
time points of culture. The fluorescence of samples was studied using
a FACS flow cytometer (BD, Bioscience).

4.7 Scaffolds
Treatments before Cell Seeding
Each scaffold was placed in
six-well plates and then washed two
times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); next, ethanol 70% was
added to each well and incubated overnight and then incubated with
sterile PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the scaffolds were
pretreated with cultivation medium for 24 h in 37 °C, 5% CO2 humid atmospheres.

4.8 Cell Viability Investigation
by MTT Assay
The scaffolds’ biocompatibility, and
the potential for supporting
cell viability, was assessed using MTT assay. The MTT can be metabolized
by the mitochondrial enzymes (dehydrogenases) of viable cells to formazan
(purple), which can be solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, and then
its observance can be measured by a spectrophotometer. About 2 ×
104 AT-MSCs were seeded onto the 3D scaffolds in six-well
cell culture plates and were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 humid incubator. At days 3, 5, and 9, 0.5 mL of MTT solution was
added to 1.5 mL of cultivation medium, and then incubated for 4 h
in the incubator. After about 15 min, shaking the dissolved formazan
was transferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbances were measured
by a plate reader at 570 nm. Also, as control, the cells were grown
on TCPs without any scaffolds.

4.9 SEM Observations
Microscopic structures
of the PCL, PCL–PLLA, and their Col hybrid scaffolds were studied
by a SEM (KYKY 3200). First, the scaffolds were sectioned, and then
the top, bottom, and cross section surfaces were coated with a thin
layer of gold (5–10 nm) and visualized. To view the cell growth
in the scaffolds, the scaffolds seeded with cells were harvested from
the six-well plates, then washed with PBS, and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the scaffolds were washed
with PBS and were let to dry at room temperature. Finally, the samples
were coated with gold and visualized by SEM with a voltage of 25 kV.

4.10 Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were performed in triplicate, and data are represented as mean ±
SD. For statistical analysis, the statistical method analysis of variance
was employed using SPSS software. In our outputs, p values less than 0.05 were interpreted significant.
