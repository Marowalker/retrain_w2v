High-density lipoprotein (HDL) nanoparticles
doped with gadolinium
lipids can be used as magnetic resonance imaging diagnostic agents
for atherosclerosis. In this study, HDL nanoparticles with different
molar fractions of gadolinium lipids (0 < xGd-lipids < 0.33) were prepared, and the MR relaxivity
values (r1 and r2) for all compositions
were measured. Both r1 and r2 parameters
reached a maximal value at a molar fraction of approximately xGd-lipids = 0.2. Higher payloads of gadolinium
did not significantly increase relaxivity values but induced changes
in the structure of HDL, increasing the size of the particles from dH = 8.2 ± 1.6 to 51.7 ± 7.3 nm. High
payloads of gadolinium lipids trigger conformational changes in HDL,
with potential effects on the in vivo behavior of the nanoparticles.

Introduction
Atherosclerosis, the
accumulation of lipids and immune cells in
arterial walls, is the underlying cause of many cardiovascular diseases.1 A new generation of treatments for atherosclerosis
is particularly focused on the use of drugs against vessel wall inflammation.2−4 Recent studies in the field have shown that nanomedicine-based theranostic
agents can work more efficiently in targeting the disease sites than
the use of bare therapeutics. In this sense, direct targeting of atherosclerotic
sites by nanosystems that exploit natural plaque homing mechanisms
is a very promising approach to treat this disease.5,6 In
this sense, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) naturally interacts with
lipid-laden plaque macrophages through adenosine 5′-triphosphate-binding
cassette transporters A1/G1 and scavenger receptor B1A. Those interactions
lead to the transfer of cholesterol from the cells to the nanoparticle
and its reverse transport back to the liver.7

In this field, the effective use of reconstituted HDLs for
therapeutic
and/or diagnostic purposes has been broadly reported.7−11

Nascent HDL is a small disklike nanoparticle with a diameter
of
8–12 nm that comprises an amphiphilic apolipoprotein embracing
a planar bilayer of phospholipids.11 Typically,
to generate HDL biomimetic nanoparticles, apolipoprotein APOA1 is
incubated with 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC) and 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(MHPC),12 although the use of alternative
lipids and peptides has also been reported for HDL-like nanoparticles.13

The introduction of paramagnetic magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)
probes (e.g., gadolinium ions) in molecules of biomedical interest
is an extended practice in the field of molecular imaging, allowing
the tracking of the in vivo fate of the molecules by noninvasive means.9,14 Paramagnetic compounds influence the physicochemical environment
of nearby water molecules, shortening the magnetic resonance longitudinal
(T1) or transversal (T2) relaxation
times (i.e., increasing the relaxation rates, defined as R1 = 1/T1 and R2 = 1/T2). However, the intrinsic low sensitivity of T1
contrast on MR images demands the use of effective amplification strategies
like the preparation of nanoparticles that include high payloads of
gadolinium, to increase the longitudinal relaxivity (r1) per particle.15 In the case of self-assembling
systems (e.g., micelles, liposomes, or rHDL), it is frequent to use
commercially available lipids containing gadolinium chelates, such
as Gd-DTPA–DSA16 and Gd-DTPA–DMPE17−20 (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid Gd[III] salts of, respectively,
distearylamide and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanol
amine-N-diethylenetriamine), among others.

Gadolinium phospholipids are incorporated into the particles during
the assembly phase, together with other phospholipids, thus avoiding
the need for chemical synthesis for the introduction of the probe
and allowing the detection of HDL by MRI techniques.

In the
particular case of T1-based contrast enhancement
in MRI, and due to the specific physical mechanisms implicated in
its generation,15,21−23 the use of
large amounts of gadolinium units may not necessarily ensure a high
value for the relaxivity of the molecule,22,24 due to effects such as a disproportionate increase in the transverse
relaxivity (r2) with respect to the longitudinal
one (r1), limited water accessibility to highly packed
gadolinium ions, the existence of particular regimes of rotation,
or translation and diffusion correlation times of molecules. As such, T1 relaxivity is strongly dependent on the composition,
stability, and size of the self-assembled nanoparticles. Thus, the
introduction of gadolinium-laden lipids as T1 contrast
agents for MRI into self-assembling nanoparticles, such as HDL, is
not a trivial issue, and the proportion of those lipids in the composition
of the particle has to be carefully adjusted for each particular nanosystem.24

Results and Discussion
The initial
aim of this work was to study the effects of the presence
of different loads of Gd-DTPA–DSA lipids in HDL particles.
For this purpose, we synthesized eight different sets of HDL nanoparticles,
with an increasing molar fraction of xGd-DTPA–DSA = 0.0, 0.098, 0.175, 0.207, 0.237, 0.263, 0.287, and 0.333. For
each set of nanoparticles, 10 identical batches (n = 10) were prepared, achieving a total of n = 80
samples for our study (see the Materials and Methods section for further details).

Five dilutions (1, 0.75, 0.5,
0.25, 0.125) of solutions containing
ca. 1.5 mM of total amount of lipids were prepared for each of the n = 80 samples of HDL (eight compositions, n = 10 batches each), and the longitudinal (T1) and
transversal (T2) relaxation times of each of these
dilutions were measured. After calculation of the respective longitudinal
(R1 = 1/T1) and transversal (R2 = 1/T2) relaxation rates, these parameters
were plotted versus the total concentration of lipids in mM (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)),
revealing strong linear correlations for all plots. The slopes of
the linear regressions in the plots of the relaxation rates versus
the concentration represent the longitudinal (r1)
and transversal (r2) MR relaxivities of the particles.
MR relaxivities for naive HDL (no gadolinium) were virtually equal
to zero (r1 = 0.00 ± 0.00 mM–1 s–1, r2 = −0.04 ±
0.03 mM–1 s–1). The values determined
for the longitudinal relaxivities were r1 = 6.54
± 1.95, 7.85 ± 0.65, 8.34 ± 0.51, 8.19 ± 1.24,
8.14 ± 0.67, 8.61 ± 0.54, and 8.68 ± 0.69 mM–1 s–1, and the values determined for the transversal
relaxivities were r2 = 7.92 ± 3.24, 10.96 ±
0.69, 12.17 ± 1.14, 11.67 ± 1.68, 12.18 ± 0.84, 12.71
± 0.94, and 12.81 ± 0.70 mM–1 s–1, for the HDL compositions containing molar fractions of gadolinium
lipids of xGd-DTPA–DSA =
0.098, 0.175, 0.207, 0.237, 0.263, 0.287, and 0.333, respectively.

When values were plotted versus the molar fraction of gadolinium
lipids included in each set of particles (Figure 1), we observed that the addition of high
payloads of gadolinium lipids in the composition did not result in
a significant increase in r1 and r2 MR relaxivities.

Figure 1 Variation of the longitudinal (r1, hollow
circles)
and transversal (r2, filled circles) MR relaxivities
for HDL formulations vs their contents in Gd-lipids (expressed as
molar fraction). Each point represents the mean (±SD) of n = 10 different batches of particles. Dashed lines correspond
to values calculated with a developed model that explains the experimental
results (see SI for details).

In this plot, a plateau is reached at values of r1 ≈ 8 mM–1 s–1 and r2 ≈ 12 mM–1 s–1. These values are of the same order of magnitude
as the published
values of those parameters for HDL particles doped with Gd-DTPA–DSA.16,17,25

Furthermore, the size and
shape of the nanoparticles were measured
by using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) techniques. The mean hydrodynamic diameter measured
for naive HDL particles (no gadolinium) was dH = 8.4 ± 1.1 nm, in agreement with the 7–12 nm
range of sizes reported in the literature.26,27

For the other seven sets of HDL particles containing Gd-DTPA–DSA
(xGd-DTPA–DSA = 0.098, 0.175,
0.207, 0.237, 0.263, 0.287, and 0.333), mean measured sizes were,
respectively, dH = 8.3 ± 1.5, 13.2
± 14.1, 19.3 ± 20.0, 23.4 ± 21.7, 35.4 ± 20.6,
44.9 ± 20.2, and 38.5 ± 21.1 nm. A plot of the size of the
particles versus their contents in gadolinium lipids, expressed as
molar fraction (xGd-DTPA–DSA), is presented in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (Top) Experimental values of the mean (±SD) sizes obtained
for the eight sets of n = 10 batches of particles
(filled squares) vs the molar fraction of Gd-DTPA–DSA lipids
in them. The dashed lines are calculated values according to our model
for this system (see the SI for full details).
(Bottom) Particle sizes for each individual HDL sample, measured at t = 0, 12, and 96 h after preparation. Except for a few
outliers (data larger or smaller than 2 times the standard deviation
of the mean), particle sizes are grouped around two different populations
(delimited by boxes labeled A and B) with a mean (±SD) size of
8.2 ± 1.6 nm (type A, n = 143) and 51.7 ±
7.3 nm (type B, n = 86).

Whereas the sizes of HDL particles containing a 0.098 molar
fraction
of gadolinium lipids are included within the 7–12 nm range
reported for naive HDL particles, HDL particles containing higher
molar fractions of Gd-DTPA–DSA revealed larger hydrodynamic
diameters and very high standard deviation values.

To further
investigate the cause of the high standard deviations
observed for the particle sizes, we plotted the value of each individual
sample versus its content in gadolinium (Figure 2).

This plot suggests the existence
of two different particle populations
(delimited by boxes A and B), with defined mean sizes of dH(A) = 8.2 ± 1.6 nm (n = 143) and dH(B) = 51.7 ± 7.3 nm (n = 86) and reasonably reduced standard deviations.

Type A particles
correspond to the typical 7–12 nm disklike
structure of naive HDL, whereas type B particles are sixfold larger
structures.

To confirm these results, a sample of type A particles
(batch of xGd-DTPA–DSA =
0.098) and a sample
of type B particles (batch of xGd-DTPA–DSA = 0.333) were characterized by TEM. TEM micrographs of both samples
are presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 (Top) TEM image of a batch of type A particles (molar fraction
of Gd-DTPA–DSA of xGd = 0.098),
showing the typical disklike structure of HDL. Disks are piled back
to back as it happens with naive HDL. (Bottom) TEM image of a batch
of type B particles (molar fraction of Gd-DTPA–DSA of xGd = 0.33), showing the formation of sixfold
larger structures. Scale bar is the same for both images (see Figure S2 for a TEM image of HDL particles with
no gadolinium lipids).

The sample of particles with a low (xGd = 0.098) molar fraction of gadolinium lipids (Figure 3, top) shows small typical
disklike structures,
characteristic of natural nascent HDL nanoparticles. Disks appear
piled back to back, a feature also characteristic of TEM images of
natural nascent HDL. On the other hand, similar to DLS measurements,
TEM micrographs of the particles with a high molar fraction of gadolinium
lipids revealed the presence of two populations: discoidal HDL and
(up to sixfold) large nanoparticles (Figure 3, bottom).

As the main goal of this
work consisted in the optimization of
gadolinium-laden HDL-like particles, we did not further investigate
the nature and properties of the larger aggregates. Future work should
confirm that functional properties of this sort of larger aggregates
are quite different from nascent HDL particles, as it can be suspected
by the structural differences revealed by DLS and electron microscopy
studies.

Our experimental findings allowed us to develop a model
that explains
the experimental behavior observed for the mean relaxivity (Figure 1) and mean particle
sizes (Figure 2) with
respect to the molar fraction of gadolinium lipids used for the preparation
of MRI-labeled HDL nanoparticles. The principles of this model are
schematically represented in Figure 4, and the model is fully developed in the SI.

Figure 4 Schematic representation of the model. Under
sonication (energy),
a mixture of DMPC, MHPC, and APOA1 in solution yields HDL particles.
Low amounts of Gd-DTPA–DSA lipids can be packed in disklike
conformations (A). Above a certain threshold, alternative molecular
rearrangements (B particles) are more stable. The large aggregate
shown here is an example for purely descriptive purposes and the factual
structure may be different.

The suggested model proposes the following:(1) The use of increasing
molar fractions
of gadolinium lipids (xGd-DTPA–DSA) in the preparation of HDL induces an increase in the MR relaxivity
values of the particles (both r1 and r2), while maintaining the mean size of the particle at dH = 8.2 ± 1.1 nm, characteristic of the disklike
structure of naive HDL.

(2) Once a certain critical value of xGd-DTPA–DSA is reached, the preparation
of a batch of particles by a combination of DMPC, MHPC, Gd-DTPA–DSA,
and APOA1 can lead to the formation of either HDL-like particles (dH = 8.2 ± 1.1 nm) or a different type of
particle with a sixfold mean size (dH =
51.7 ± 7.3 nm). Once formed, both types of particles are stable.

(3) Above this critical xGd-DTPA–DSA value, the probability
of obtaining
large particles increases linearly with the molar fraction of gadolinium
lipids added to the system.



It is important
to remark that, according to this model, there
is a critical value of xGd-DTPA–DSA that should not be exceeded for preparing a batch of Gd-labeled
HDL particles, to ensure the formation of typical ≈8 nm disklike
structures. If larger amounts of gadolinium are used, there is a probability
(whose frequency increases with the amount of gadolinium lipids) of
obtaining another kind of larger structure, instead of HDL disks.
In fact, this is not the first report of changes in size and morphology
of APOA1 stabilized disks after doping the molecules with large amounts
of gadolinium lipids.15

This model
represents a simple interpretation of the experimental
data. When more precise modeling of the data is desired, other effects,
like potential “saturation” of T1 in
the case of restricted water access to Gd ions at high concentrations,
should be taken into account, and more complex models, like the one
proposed by Strijkers et al.,28 should
be considered.

For the particular case of Gd-DTPA–DSA,
we have estimated
a value of Xcritical = 0.148 (see the SI for details). However, for other gadolinium
lipids this value will most likely vary depending on the nature and
properties of the lipids used for labeling HDL. Indeed, it is reasonable
to believe that the formation of larger aggregates is not an exclusive
event for gadolinium-doped lipids, and it can be expected that other
lipids without paramagnetic label cause a similar effect. In any case,
the critical value of the molar fraction at which larger aggregates
are formed should be estimated for each particular case.

It
has been reported that, in solution, disklike structures are
thermodynamically more stable than the coexistence of a mixture of
APOA1 and separated larger lipid vesicles.26,27

The substitution of a fraction of DMPC lipids by gadolinium
lipids,
with different structures and properties, may affect the packaging
of lipids by APOA1, altering the balance between the enthalpy and
entropy of formation of disklike structures, forcing in this way the
formation of thermodynamically more favored structures. In this case,
it is logical to believe that the use of increasing amounts of gadolinium
lipids during synthesis would increase the probability of formation
of larger aggregates and that there is a critical point for the amount
of gadolinium lipids that can be introduced into the structure of
HDL before triggering a conformational change of HDL particles to
larger structures.

Furthermore, several authors have suggested
a high activation barrier
for the formation of disks (sonication is used for disk formation,
see Figure 4), but
also for the degradation of disks, ensuring the stability of disklike
structures in solution, once formed.25,29,30 In other words, spontaneous rearrangements between
the pre-existing structures A and B seem unlikely (see the scheme
in Figure 4).

Further research should be done to reveal whether the use of alternative
MRI probes to Gd-DTPA–DSA, with a composition and structure
more similar to DMPC, would induce changes in the morphology of the
particles, and at which molar fraction this event would eventually
take place.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the labeling of HDL for
MRI detection purposes is
a very promising feature for in vivo applications of this molecule.
However, the use of gadolinium lipids must be cautiously analyzed
to avoid conformational changes of the particles, which would yield
larger nanosystems with a potentially different in vivo behavior.

Materials
and Methods
Synthesis of HDL Nanoparticles
Phospholipids: DMPC,
MHPC, and Gd-DTPA–DSA (gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetatedistearylamide)
were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Apolipoprotein
A-1 solution (APOA1) was donated by CSL Ltd. (Parkville, Australia).
Phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 1×) was obtained from Fisher
Scientific (Pittsburg, PA).

HDL nanoparticles were prepared
in eight different compositions, following procedures described elsewhere.8 In brief, three stock solutions containing 10
mg/mL of DMPC, MHPC, or Gd-DTPA–DSA were prepared, using a
3:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform and methanol as solvent. Then, proper
volumes of these stock solutions were mixed to achieve the desired
composition of HDL particles. The total amount of lipids in the final
mixture was fixed to either 2.5 mg/mL (for n = 5
batches of particles per composition tested) or 5 mg/mL (in another n = 5 batches of particles per composition tested), giving
a total of n = 10 batches of particles per composition
tested. The mass ratio between single chained lipids (MHPC) versus
double chained lipids (DMPC + Gd-DTPA–DSA) was always kept
constant at 1/10 (w/w), whereas eight different DMPC/Gd-DTPA–DSA
mass ratios (1/0, 1/0.2, 1/0.4, 1/0.6, 1/0.8, and 1/1 all of them
w/w) were used, giving HDL nanoparticles containing molar ratios of
gadolinium lipids of xGd-DTPA–DSA = 0.000, 0.098, 0.175, 0.207, 0.237, 0.263, 0.287, and 0.333. A
table summarizing the composition of each particle is presented in
the SI.

The solvent of each mixture
of lipids was removed under reduced
pressure to form a lipid film, which was thoroughly dried under vacuum
overnight. Films were subsequently hydrated with 5 mL of PBS (1×)
and a proper amount of ApoA1 protein (ApoA1 vs total amount of lipids
in a constant mass ratio of 1 to 2.5 w/w). Solutions were then incubated
at 37 °C for 3 h and then submitted to sonication for 60 min
(avoiding overheating by keeping the samples on ice during the whole
process). Finally, samples were centrifuged (2880g, 30 min) to remove metal debris from the sonicator probe and centrifuged
again (2880g, 30 min) in 100 kDa molecular weight
cut-off (MWCO) tubes (Vivaspin; Sartorius Corporation, Edgewood, NY)
to remove uncomplexed lipids. Five batches of samples per composition
were incubated overnight at 25 °C (bench), whereas the other
five batches of particles per composition were incubated overnight
at 37 °C (incubator). For all batches, the samples were further
stored at 4 °C.

Magnetic Resonance studies
For each
of the n = 80 HDL samples prepared (eight compositions, n = 10 batches each), five different dilutions (1, 0.75,
0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 times the initial concentration) were prepared
in PBS (1×), and T1 and T2
MR relaxation times were measured using a Minispec system (Bruker
BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany), operating at 60 MHz. T1 values were acquired in duplicate with a saturation–recovery
sequence of 12 exponentially distributed repetition times ranging
from 100 ms to 12 s, whereas T2 values were acquired
4 times, using a CPMG sequence of 3600 points with an interpulse delay
of 1 ms.

After measurement of the relaxation times (T1 and T2) for the series of five dilutions
for each sample, the corresponding relaxation rates, R1 = 1/T1 and R2 = 1/T2, were calculated and plotted versus the total concentration of
lipids in each sample (see Figure S1). Those plots were fitted to linear
regressions, corresponding the slope of each plot to the respective
ionic relaxivity of the sample under study.

DLS Studies
The
hydrodynamic diameter of the particles
was measured by DLS. Diluted samples of nanoparticles were prepared
in distilled water and measured at 25 °C using a ZetaPALS analyzer
(Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY). Particle sizes were determined
as the mean of 10 cumulative acquisitions each of 1 min length. Sizes
were measured just after the synthesis of the nanoparticles (t = 0) and 12 and 96 h later, observing no significant changes
in size with time.

TEM
TEM microscopy images of selected
samples were
acquired using a Hitachi H-7650 TEM microscope (Hitachi High Technologies,
Pleasanton, CA) operating at 80 kV, coupled to a Scientific Instruments
and Applications digital camera, controlled by the Maxim charge-coupled
device software.

HDL samples were centrifuged in (MWCO 100 000)
centrifugal concentration tubes (Vivaspin; Sartorius Corporation,
Edgewood, NY) to replace the original buffer solution by acetate buffer
(0.125 M ammonium acetate, 2.6 mM ammonium carbonate, and 0.26 mM
tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate at pH 7.4). Afterward, 10
μL of HDL solution was mixed with 10 μL of 2% phosphotungstic
acid for negative staining and casted on a 100-mesh Formvar-coated
nickel grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA).
