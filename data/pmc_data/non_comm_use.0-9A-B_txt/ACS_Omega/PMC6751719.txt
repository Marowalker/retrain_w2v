Bees
are essential pollinators on earth, supporting forest equilibrium
and human agriculture. The chemistry of the stingless bee–plant
symbiosis is a complex and not completely understood phenomenon. Here,
we combined untargeted tandem mass spectrometry, molecular networking,
and multivariate statistical analysis to investigate the chemical
diversity in colonies of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona
depilis. Flavonoids were the most representative and
diverse group of plant metabolites detected, indicating the importance
of these biologically active natural products to the bees. We unveiled
the metabolome, mapped the distribution of plant metabolites in stingless
bee colonies, and digitized the chemical data into a public database.

Introduction
Plants and bees engage
in symbiotic relationships vital for forest
equilibrium and human agriculture.1 One
important group of these pollinators is the stingless bee tribe (Hymenoptera,
Apidae, Meliponini), which resides in tropical and subtropical regions
of the planet.2 This group is the most
diverse tribe of eusocial corbiculate bees, with more than 500 species
distributed in tropical and subtropical areas of the globe.3 Stingless bees visit several plants to collect
resins, pollen, and nectar necessary for hive construction and feeding.2,4 Nectar is the main source of carbohydrates, while pollen is the
protein source for these pollinators.2,5 The plants’
resins are mixed with cephalic glandular secretions to produce propolis,
which is essential to seal the colony cavities and to inhibit invading
insects and microorganisms.6

The
stingless bees’ behaviors are coordinated by an elaborate
and complex chemical communication system, which is mediated mainly
by nonpolar compounds. Cuticular hydrocarbons act as chemical signals
to indicate the queen’s presence and to reduce the reproductive
behavior of the bee workers.7,8 Although there is an
increasing knowledge regarding the nonpolar compounds from stingless
bees, little is known about the metabolome of the polar compounds.
Recent advances in analytical techniques based on mass spectrometry
(MS) can be applied to unravel the metabolome of stingless bees’
colonies. The Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking
(GNPS), for instance, has been applied by the scientific community
as a valuable tool to unveil the metabolome from microorganisms, plants,
animals, and humans.9−13 The GNPS molecular networking organizes the compounds according
to their tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) features in clusters and
compare the spectrums with spectral libraries.14 Hits to the GNPS libraries provide the level 2 annotations,
which are putatively annotated compounds according to the metabolomics
initiative.15

The stingless bee Scaptotrigona depilis participates in a multispecies
symbiosis with plants and has recently
received attention due to the consumption of a brood fungus required
for their larval development.16,17 This generalist pollinator
can visit up to 54 plant genera over the year to collect pollen.4 Such a massive collection of plant substrates
results in a remarkable and underexplored mixture of natural products
in these bees’ colonies. The poor information regarding the
chemical diversity of stingless bees’ colonies reinforces the
importance to investigate and digitize the chemical data in open databases
for future public multi-omics platforms.18 As an initiative to study the global metabolome of bees, we digitized
the metabolites and mapped the chemical diversity in colonies of the
fungus-growing stingless bee S. depilis.

Results and Discussion
Samples of honey, fermented pollen,
nurse bees, pupae, larvae,
larval food from brood cells with eggs, larval food from brood cells
with larvae, brood fungus, cerumen, propolis, and the colony entrance
were collected from three colonies of the stingless bee S. depilis (Figure 1). The extracts were analyzed by untargeted liquid
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) and subjected
to multivariate statistical analyses and molecular networking. Unsupervised
principal component analysis (PCA) indicated a clustering tendency
in four groups, according to the chemical similarity of the detected
ions (Figure 2). Subsequently,
supervised orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant
analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed the clear separation between the four
groups (Figure S1). Pollen, larval food
with eggs, larval food with larvae, nurse bees, larvae, and brood
fungus were clustered together (group 1), as well as the samples of
cerumen, entrance, and propolis (group 2). Meanwhile, the samples
of honey (group 3) and pupae (group 4) were chemically different from
the other samples. Nurse bees, larvae, and brood fungus were clustered
in group 1 due to the presence of compounds from pollen since nurse
bees prepare larval food with pollen and larvae and brood fungus grow
in intimate contact with larval food.

The mass spectrometry
data were submitted to the Global Natural
Products Social Molecular Networking platform (GNPS) to generate the
molecular networks and to perform the spectral library search.14 A total of 129129 spectra from positive and
negative LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses was merged by GNPS into 3124 nodes,
which represent the chemical entities. The nodes were connected based
on the MS/MS spectral similarity, resulting in 5018 pairs in the molecular
networks (Figure 3 and Figure S2). The large number of nodes revealed
the complex chemical composition of samples from S.
depilis colonies, while the clusters evidenced the
diversity of molecular families. The spectral library search resulted
in 724 hits, and the majority of MS/MS spectra (76.8%) were not annotated,
indicating the potential of these stingless bee colonies as sources
of new compounds.

ion monitoring
mode (A) and selected clusters with nodes showing the compounds annotated
by GNPS library search (B).

Primary metabolites, such as amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins,
were identified predominantly in pollen, honey, larval food, larvae,
pupae, nurse bees, brood fungus, and propolis (Figure S4 and Table S1). Flavonoids were detected in all S. depilis samples and were the most diverse class
of natural products identified (Figure 4, Figure S5, Table S1).
Propolis and pollen presented the highest diversity of flavonoids,
while few flavonoids were detected in the pupae samples. Flavonoids
were grouped in clusters of aglycones, biflavonoids, and flavonoid
glycosides. The glycoside attachments were diverse, occurring on carbons
or oxygens from rings A, B, and C (Figure 4). Glucose, xylose, and rhamnose were the
major glucosides attached. Aglycones were common in all samples, while
biflavonoids were restricted to the propolis, cerumen, and colony
entrance. Flavonoids were also detected in colonies of other stingless
bees’ species and the honey bee Apis mellifera.19−21

metabolites annotated by GNPS library search.

Such a diversity of flavonoids, combined with their notable biological
activities, indicates their importance to the bees. The antioxidant
activities of flavonoids can contribute to neutralizing the oxidant
effects of honey, which presents antibiotic activity mostly due to
the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).22,23 The oxidizing effects of H2O2 can be harmful
to the bees, and thus, these pollinators produce enzymes to eliminate
H2O2, for example, catalase and peroxidase.24 However, this agent (H2O2) can oxidize compounds from honey originating compounds that cannot
be neutralized by these enzymes,24 and
flavonoids can play an important role in neutralizing the remaining
oxidizing agents.

Flavonoids can also contribute to the chemical
protection of bee
colonies against invading microorganisms since these compounds have
cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities.25 Despite their protective role, flavonoids can be harmful to bees
by chelating metals and binding proteins and carbohydrates.26−29 Insects produce surfactants to prevent the injurious effects of
polyphenols, such as the lysophospholipids.30,31 We found that S. depilis nurse bees,
pupae, and larvae also contain lysophospholipids, such as 1-palmitoylglycerophosphocholine
(XIII) and 1-stearoylglycerophosphocholine (XIV), which could protect them against the side effects of flavonoids.
Interestingly, the lysophospholipid precursor glycerophosphorylcholine
(XII) was detected in pollen and propolis, indicating
that plants are also a source of these surfactant precursors for the
bees.

The phenolamide spermidine-diferuloyl (XV) was detected
in pollen and larval food with larvae, while the spermidine-p-coumaroyl-feruloyl (XVI) was detected in
pollen, larval food with eggs and with larvae, brood fungus, larvae,
bees, cerumen, and entrance. The absence of spermidine-p-coumaroyl-feruloyl (XVI) in propolis and the presence
in cerumen indicate that this compound can be diffused from pollen-derived
samples to cerumen. Although containing a high number of plant metabolites,
the bacterial antibiotic lincomycin (XVII) was annotated
in the S. depilis honey. Studies reported
the isolation of antibiotic-producing bacteria from bees’ colonies,
and lincomycin could be produced by such symbiont bacteria.32,33

The tandem mass spectrometry data of the four groups were
also
organized in a Venn diagram (Figure 2). This diagram revealed that most of the detected
compounds (67.7%) were unique to each group and that 30.8% were shared
between two or three groups, while just 1.6% were common to all samples. Flavonoids, riboflavin
(X) and adenosine (XI) were detected in
all samples, indicating that these compounds can play an important
ecological role for the bees. The compounds common to all samples
could be investigated in future studies to verify their biological
roles in stingless bees’ colonies.

Bees manipulate and
consume the plant-derived samples, and consequently,
the collected compounds can be metabolized. As we applied untargeted
mass spectrometry analysis, these putative metabolites produced by
bee metabolism can also be included in the networks. In the case of S. depilis, the chemical diversity in pupae was lower
than those in the larval food and larvae samples (Figures S6–S11), indicating that the pupae can metabolize
the ingested compounds, but the resulting metabolites remain unknown.
Flavonoid metabolizing enzymes were found in the honey bee; however,
the produced metabolites were not identified.34,35 The metabolism of plant metabolites by these pollinators merits
to be further investigated, and our data open perspectives to study
the metabolism of plant metabolites by bees.

Conclusions
In
summary, untargeted LC-ESI-MS/MS, multivariate analyses, GNPS
molecular networking, and spectral library searches unveiled the chemical
diversity of S. depilis colonies. Flavonoids
were the most representative group of plant secondary metabolites
detected, indicating the importance of these compounds to the bees.
The chemical data of our analysis are publicly available from GNPS
and can contribute to forthcoming research regarding stingless bees.
Our results highlight the importance of plants as sources of primary
and secondary metabolites for stingless bees and can also contribute
to planning future strategies to protect these threatened pollinators.

Methods
Sample
Collection
Samples were collected from three
colonies of S. depilis maintained at
the Department of Biology, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão
Preto City, São Paulo State, Brazil (SisGen authorization:
A3AA351). All collections were carried out in April 2017, and the
samples were stored in a −20 °C freezer. A total of 11
samples was collected from each colony: honey, fermented pollen, larval
food from brood cells with eggs, larval food from brood cells with
larvae, symbiont fungus collected from brood cells, larvae, pupae,
bees, cerumen, propolis, and the colony entrance. The symbiont fungi
collected from brood cells and larvae were rinsed three times with
Milli-Q water to eliminate the excess larval food.

Chemical Extraction
and Sample Preparation
Samples
were first mixed with liquid nitrogen and triturated using a mortar
and pestle. Aliquots of 50 mg of larvae and brood cell fungus and
100 mg of the other samples were extracted with 1 mL of methanol for
10 min in an ultrasonic bath followed by 60 min at room temperature.
The solvent was evaporated using a SpeedVac, and the resulting crude
extracts were cleaned using C18 (100 mg) SPE cartridges.
The cartridges were activated with pure methanol (1 mL) and conditioned
with water (3 mL). Crude extracts were dissolved with 1 mL of 1:9
methanol/water (v/v) and passed through the cartridges, which were
washed three times with 1 mL of water. Aliquots of honey (200 μL)
were mixed with water (1800 μL) and passed through the cartridges,
which were washed three times with 1 mL of water. The samples were
eluted with 1 mL of 9:1 methanol/water (v/v) and concentrated to dryness.
All samples were dissolved with methanol and filtered (0.22 μm)
into 1 mL HPLC vials before the chemical analyses.

Chemical Analyses
Tandem mass spectrometry analyses
were carried out on a Shimadzu UFLC system (two LC20AD solvent pumps,
a CTO20A column oven set to 40 °C, a SIL20A autosampler, and
a CBM20A controller) coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer (AmaZon
SL). The samples (20 μL) were analyzed using a C18 Phenomenex column (250 mm × 4.6 mm; 5 μm particle) eluted
with a mixture of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B),
both of which contained 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1, as follows: 0–5 min (10% of B), 5–60
min (10–100% of B), 60–70 min (100% of B), 70–75
min (100–10% of B), and 75–85 (10% of B).

The
ion trap mass spectrometer was operated in positive and negative ionization
modes with the following parameters: capillary of 3.5 kV; end plate
offset of 500 V; nebulizer of 60 psi, dry gas (N2) with
a flow of 10 L min–1; dry temperature of 330 °C;
auto MS/MS acquiring data between m/z 50 and 1300, average of 3 spectra; enhanced resolution for scan
mode and UltraScan mode for MS/MS; spectral rate acquisition three
spectra per second; exclusion of a particular ion after three spectra
and released after 30 s. The mass spectrometer was controlled by Hystar
software (Bruker Daltonics Inc., USA).

Molecular Networking and
Dereplication
The LC–MS/MS
data were converted to the mzXML format using ProteoWizard-MSconvert36 (Proteowizard Software Foundation, USA) and
uploaded to GNPS.14 Analyses were carried
out based on parameters previously used in GNPS by different research
groups.37−39 The resulting data are publicly available under the
MassIVE accession number MSV000084208 and the GNPS links https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=1a05415b72054cc199b3768d4c7fc93e for the positive ionization mode and https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/status.jsp?task=0f9b4f5fa9d1430c91bb449018b8ac89 for the negative ionization mode. The data were filtered by removing
all MS/MS peaks within 17 Da of the precursor ion and were clustered
with MS-Cluster40 with a parent mass tolerance
of 2.0 Da and an MS/MS fragment ion tolerance of 0.5 Da to create
a consensus spectrum. Consensus spectra that contained less than two
spectra were discarded. To create the molecular network, the edges
were filtered to have a cosine score above 0.7 with more than four
matched peaks. Further edges between two nodes were kept in the network
if and only if each of the nodes appeared in each other’s respective
top 10 most similar nodes. The molecular networks were analyzed and
edited using Cytoscape Version 3.8.41 Each
node was labeled with its parent mass, a pie slice proportional to
the number of MS/MS spectra for each parent mass, and a color indicating
the sample source. The edges between the nodes indicated the cosine
values, referring to the level of MS/MS similarity between the nodes.
The spectra were then searched against GNPS’s spectral library
and filtered in the same manner as the input data.

Multivariate
Statistical Analysis
The data files of
the positive and negative ionization modes, previously converted to
the mzXML format, were separately preprocessed by MzMine (BMC Bioinformatics,
United Kingdom), employing the following parameters: mass detection
using the exact mass algorithm (noise level, 1.0 × 104); chromatogram builder (minimum time span in minutes, 0.2; minimum
height, 1.5 × 104; m/z tolerance, 0.5 m/z or 10 ppm);
chromatogram deconvolution using the baseline cutoff (minimum peak
height, 1.5 × 104; peak duration, 0.2 to 1.0; baseline
level, 1.0 × 104); isotopic peak grouper (m/z tolerance, 0.5 m/z or 10 ppm; retention time tolerance in minutes, 0.2; maximum
charge, 2; representative isotope, most intense); and alignment using
the join aligner (m/z tolerance,
0.5 m/z or 10 ppm; weight for m/z, 20; retention time tolerance, 5%;
weight for retention time, 20). After individual preprocessing, the
data matrices of the positive and negative ionization modes were combined
into a single spreadsheet, and the peaks detected in the controls
were removed from each sample.

Unsupervised statistical analysis
(principal component analysis, PCA) and supervised statistical analysis
(orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis,
OPLS-DA) were carried out with SIMCA 13.0.3.0 (Umetrics, Sweden).
The OPLS-DA classes were determined in accordance with the samples:
pollen, larval food with eggs, larval food with larvae, brood fungus,
larvae, and bees (group 1); propolis, cerumen, and entrance (group
2); honey (group 3); and pupae (group 4). Discriminant variables were
assessed by the variable influence on projection (VIP) generated through
OPLS-DA. Discriminant compounds were identified based on the GNPS
spectral library searches.
