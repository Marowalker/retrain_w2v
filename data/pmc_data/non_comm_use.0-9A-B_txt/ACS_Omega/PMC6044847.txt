We propose a highly sensitive
sensor based on enhancing the transversal magneto-optical Kerr effect
(TMOKE) through excitation of surface plasmon resonances in a novel
and simple architecture, which consists of a metal grating on a metal
magneto-optical layer. Detection of the change in the refractive index
of the analyte medium is made by monitoring the angular shift of the
Fano-like resonances associated with TMOKE. A higher resolution is
obtained with this technique than with reflectance curves. The key
aspect of the novel architecture is to achieve excitation of surface
plasmon resonances mainly localized at the sensing layer, where interaction
with the analyte occurs. This led to a high sensitivity, S = 190° RIU–1, and high performance with a
figure of merit of the order of 103, which can be exploited
in sensors and biosensors.

Introduction
Surface
plasmon resonances (SPRs) are charge density oscillations
on metal/dielectric interfaces, which allow for concentrating electromagnetic
energy to be employed in applications at nanoscale dimensions.1−4 This electromagnetic field localization is sensitive to the dielectric
properties of the surrounding media, thus being suitable for plasmonic
biosensors in addition to real-time monitoring of adsorption processes
and studying the molecular interactions involved.5−10 Because detection requires measurable changes in the refractive
index of the analyte, this technique is mostly limited to detecting
high-molecular-weight (large) biomolecules. Several efforts are being
pursued to circumvent this limitation and improve the sensitivity
of SPR-based sensing, including the combination of SPR spectroscopy
and enzymatic detection,11 use of hyperbolic
materials12 to develop ultrasensitive SPR
biosensing platforms, and the use of magnetoplasmonic effects instead
of SPRs for the detection of very small refractive index changes.13−18 The idea behind the latter approach is to exploit the sharp Fano-like
resonant plasmonic enhanced magneto-optical (MO) effects instead of
broad plasmonic resonances. This concept has been explored in magnetoplasmonic
superlattices in the Kretschmann configuration14,15 and magnetoplasmonic crystals.16−18 Magnetoplasmonic crystals
made as one- or two-dimensional arrays of metallic scatterers combined
with magnetic layers are advantageous for miniaturization and integration
with microfluidic systems, unlike the Kretschmann-like systems, where
miniaturization is impaired by the need to use a prism with refractive
index larger than the refractive index of the dielectric background.
Enhanced TMOKE effects can be obtained with magnetoplasmonic crystals,19−23 but improved SPR sensing/biosensing was only experimentally demonstrated
during the last few years for one-dimensional grating structures.17,18 High-performance magnetoplasmonic-based sensing platforms were proposed
in a theoretical paper, which would be made of a two-dimensional grating
structure with an array of metallic nanoholes in a trilayer of Au/Co/Au.16 The proposed system is suitable for miniaturization
and may be combined with microfluidic systems to implement real-time
analysis of molecular binding events, but the precise construction
of the nanoholes in Au/Co/Au trilayers may be difficult and expensive.16

In this work, we propose the design of
a simple yet highly sensitive
sensing platform made as a one-dimensional magnetoplasmonic crystal,
consisting of a metal grating grown on a magneto-optical metallic
substrate. Because the sensitivity of an SPR-based sensor (or biosensor)
depends on where the electromagnetic field is most amplified, the
idea is to develop a magnetoplasmonic crystal to excite SPRs mainly
localized at the analyte region. This can be reached by optimizing
the geometry of the grating structure and the MO metallic slab according
to the incident wavelength.23 By using
the optimization procedure in ref (16), we show enhanced TMOKE values with very narrow
Fano-like resonant peaks, which can be interrogated by monitoring
either the angle or the wavelength. These Fano-like resonances are
extremely sensitive to the refractive index of the surrounding media,
thus allowing to detect very small changes in the dielectric properties
of the analyte.

Results and Discussion
The magnetoplasmonic
system proposed here, to be grown on a SiO2 substrate,
is shown in Figure 1. It consists of Au metal gratings on top of a planar
metallic MO layer with a 2 nm thick layer of SiO2 in between.
The magnetization (M), or external applied magnetic field,
is considered along the z axis; thus, the dielectric
permittivity tensor is written as 1  where
ε0 is the dielectric
function of the non-magnetized film (i.e., without magnetic field/magnetization)
and g takes into account the MO activity. These values
are considered as ε0 = −10.51 + 2.1i and g = −1.2 + 1.15i, corresponding to Co6Ag94 material under a working wavelength of λ =
631 nm,24 measured at room temperature
after annealing at 250 °C.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the proposed sensor
platform, where hm and hMO are the
thicknesses of the metallic and MO materials, respectively, and w is the width of the metal grating. Λ is the grating
period. The magnetization vector, M, is parallel to the z axis.

To excite an SPR, the
wavevector of the incoming light needs to
be matched to the one for a surface plasmon, , propagating at a metal/dielectric
interface.
This can be done through the diffraction mechanism by using the diffraction
grating in Figure 1, where the incident beam is split into a series of beams with the
wavevector along the interface altered as . Then, the condition for SPR excitation
is given by 2  where Λ is the period
of the grating, nan is the analyte refractive
index, εm is the permittivity of the metal, , and q is the diffraction
order. The signs ± are for q > 0 and q < 0, respectively. θ is the resonance angle at
which the plasmonic resonance occurs. The grating period and the width
of the gold gratings were chosen as Λ = 250 nm and w = 225 nm, respectively, thus having a negative diffractive order q = −1.25

Because
the main interest is to exploit the magnetoplasmonic effect
in the transversal configuration, we make use of the well-known TMOKE
parameter, which can be defined as 3  and measures the relative
change in reflectance
for p-polarized (TM-polarized) incident light, Rpp, when the magnetization (applied magnetic field) of the
MO layer is reversed. Signs ± for M refer to the
magnetization pointing along the (0, 0, ± 1) directions. All
numerical results we show in this work were obtained using the finite
element method (COMSOL Multiphysics).

For developing an optimized
one-dimensional grating structure for
SPR-based sensing/biosensing, we first need to optimize the geometry
of the metallic gratings to have very sharp TMOKE resonances with
enhanced amplitudes. Figure 2 shows the reflectance as a function of θ for various
thicknesses of the Au grating, hm, with
the analyte refractive index being nan = 1.333 to be compatible with an aqueous environment for the analyte,
and the MO layer thickness is hMO = 80
nm. The minima in the reflectance curves associated with plasmonic
resonances change with the thickness of the different Au gratings.
From these curves, the deeper reflectance curve occurs for hm = 70 nm, thus indicating an optimized coupling
of the incident light to SPRs in the structure for the working wavelength.
Therefore, henceforth we use hm = 70 for
the Au grating.

Figure 2 Reflectance as a function of θ for various thicknesses hm, using Λ = 250 nm and hMO = 80 nm. The solid, dashed, dotted, and dash-dotted
curves are for hm = 50, 70, 90, and 110
nm, respectively.

After this optimization
of the light–matter coupling, we
search for the optimal MO layer thickness that leads to the highest
TMOKE values. Figure 3a shows TMOKE as a function of θ for different MO layer thicknesses, hMO, from where it can be noted that TMOKE resonance
becomes sharp around the same θ value as hMO increases. Also, above hMO =
120 nm, there is no further increase in TMOKE, as shown in Figure 3b. Therefore, we
fix hMO = 120 nm to have optimal TMOKE
amplitudes. With this optimized geometry, the field profile of |Hz| for the resonant angle θ
= 60.7° shows strong localization in the analyte medium according
to Figure 3c. This
will enhance the dependence of the SPP resonance on the dielectric
properties of this medium. The sensing performance is quantified by
following the usual practice of defining the bulk refractive index
sensitivity as ,
where Δθ is the shift of the
Fano-like resonance and Δni is the change in refractive index of the incident medium.
Because gold gratings can be easily functionalized for sensing purposes,
in Figure 4a we show
as a practical example the proposed magnetoplasmonic platform as a
sensing/biosensing system. Significantly, this platform is able to
detect very small changes in the refractive index in the analyte medium,
with a sensitivity S = 190° RIU–1, as seen in the results in Figure 4b, which is similar to that of more complex proposals.16 As pointed out in ref (16), the performance of this
magnetoplasmonic-based sensing platform is characterized by the ratio
FoM = S/Γ, where S and Γ
are the sensitivity and line width of the Fano-like feature, respectively.
Γ is obtained by fitting the TMOKE curves as a function of θ
to a Fano line shape of the form16,26 4  where θ0 is the
resonant
angle, r is the Fano parameter, and A and B are fitting values. This analysis leads us
to a figure of merit (FoM) with values in the same order as the ones
presented in ref (16).

values of hMO. (b) Comparison of TMOKE
for three values of hMO in a zoomed figure
to show that no changes occur for hMO above
120 nm. (c) Magnitude of magnetic field |Hz|, in which the excitation of SPRs at the analyte–metallic

values of nan. The inset shows the reflectance
curves, Rpp(+M), around the
SPP resonances. (b) Solid circles show the minima of TMOKE curves
in (a) as a function of nan, whereas the
solid line corresponds to a linear fitting with a slope of −190°
RIU–1, thus producing a sensitivity of S = 190° RIU–1. (c) Figure of merit for the
optimized system, as a function of the resonant angle (see eq 4 for the definition).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated that one-dimensional magnetoplasmonic
structures can be easily optimized to produce highly sensitive sensing/biosensing
applications with similar performance to more sophisticated structures.
The proposed platform is made by just a gold grating on a magneto-optical
material, being therefore experimentally feasible. The sensitivity
predicted of S = 190° RIU–1 is high and promising for state-of-the-art sensors and biosensors.
