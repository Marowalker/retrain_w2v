The development of simple Fenton/Fenton-like systems with durative
hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation characteristics
is significant to rapid organic pollutant degradation and cost-effective
water treatment. In this study, a tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris)-incorporated Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like
system has been successfully constructed for efficient Sunset Yellow
(SY, a typical anionic azo dye) degradation under alkaline conditions.
The mechanism of the enhanced degradation consists of two parts: first,
the Tris–Co(II) complex triggers the durative generation of
highly oxidized hydroxyl radicals; second, electrostatic attraction
between SY and the Tris–Co(II) complex shortens the radical–SY
interaction time and facilitates the degradation of SY. With the introduction
of Tris to this proposed system, the decolorization rate of SY can
be increased from 37.0 to 98.0% after 50 min and efficient SY degradation
with a high total organic carbon removal efficiency (>59.0%) is achieved
under a wide initial pH from 8.7 to 12.0. Moreover, the universality
of the designed system for anionic azo dye degradation is verified
with reactive red and congo red.

==== Body
Introduction
Fenton/Fenton-like systems that produce highly oxidized hydroxyl
radicals (•OH), have been widely applied in the
degradation of organic contaminants.1−5 However, conventional Fenton/Fenton-like systems only generate •OH in a very short time, which restricts the degradation
efficiency.6 This is majorly due to the
fast reaction rate between hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and divalent transition metal ions (e.g., Fe(II) or Co(II)).7,8 Thus, the durative generation of •OH is of significance
to further improve the performance of Fenton/Fenton-like systems.
Toward this goal, a few systems with persistent •OH production characteristics have been exploited by integrating
other techniques.9−14 For example, with the introduction of the electrochemical technique,
consistent generation of •OH over a long period
has been reported.15,16 Undoubtedly, these methods require
specific setups and/or reaction conditions and are highly energy-intensive.
Therefore, it is still appealing to explore a simple, efficient, and
cost-effective method to generate •OH continuously.

As is known, the chemical coordination of transition metal ions
usually decreases their redox potentials and facilitates the trivalent/divalent
conversion.17,18 For instance, Tang et al. have
demonstrated that the Fe(III)–ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(EDTA) chelating complex could catalyze H2O2 to generate •OH efficiently in comparison to Fe(III)
only.19 The key role of the introduced
chelating agents is to facilitate the conversion of trivalent transition
metal ions to their divalent forms, which subsequently promotes the
continuous generation of •OH. Recently, we discovered
that the redox potential of Co(III)/Co(II) can be greatly reduced
using tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) as the chemical chelator.20 As a consequence, durative and effective generation
of •OH is observed. Utilizing Tris–Co(II)
as the catalyst, efficient sterilizing and long-lasting chemical lights
have been realized.20,21 Owing to the excellent durative •OH generation property, we speculate that this system
might be promising to achieve efficient degradation of organic contaminants.

It is generally accepted that electrostatic attraction between
organic contaminants and catalysts promotes the approach of generated •OH and benefits the complete oxidation and thereby
increases the total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency.22 In this study, as a proof-of-concept, we explored
a facile Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like
system for efficient Sunset Yellow (SY, a typical anionic azo dye)
degradation. The enhanced SY degradation is based on the fact that
the Tris–Co(II) catalyst promotes the durative generation of •OH and that the strong electrostatic attraction between
SY and the Tris–Co(II) catalyst facilitates the approach of •OH to SY. The efficiency of the proposed Fenton-like
SY degradation system toward the initial pH was investigated. In addition,
the degradation pathway was also investigated with liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC–MS). Furthermore, the universality of
this system to other anionic azo dyes was validated by evaluating
the degradation of reactive red and congo red.

Chem. Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Sodium azide (NaN3) was
purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Company (Tianjin, China).
Basic red, reactive red, and congo red were obtained from Shanghai
Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were
used directly without further purification. Ultrapure water (18.2
MΩ) from a Millipore system was used in all experiments. H2O2 stock solutions were prepared by diluting 30%
H2O2. The stock solution of Co(II) with a concentration
of 10.0 mmol/L was prepared by dissolving Co(NO3)2·6H2O in ultrapure water directly. The concentrations
of Tris and SY stock solutions were 1.0 mol/L and 1.0 g/L, respectively.
The initial pH values of degradation solutions were adjusted with
NaOH and HNO3. All of the stock solutions were freshly
prepared and covered with foil paper before use.

Apparatus
The absorption spectra and absorbance at
482 nm of SY were measured using a UV-2401 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu,
Japan). The ζ-measurements were performed with a Zetasizer 3000HS
nanogranularity analyzer (Malvern, U.K.). The ion chromatograph analysis
of small organic acids and inorganic ions was conducted with a Dionex
ICS-900 ion chromatograph analyzer (Thermo). Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer
(Thermo). Potassium hydroxide solution was used as the mobile phase
running at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The injective volume was 25
μL. The column temperature was 35 °C. The liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses were performed using a quattro
microtriple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). The measurements
were conducted in the negative ionization mode on an acquity UPLC
HSS T3 column. The gradient elution was regulated by water and acetonitrile
at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The MS spray voltage was 2.2 kV. The
injection volume was 2.0 μL. The column temperature was 45 °C.

Total Organic Carbon Measurement
Total organic carbon
(TOC) content changes of SY in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 and Co(II)–H2O2 systems were measured with a TOC-L CPH analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan).
To deduct the influence of the TOC change of Tris, the TOC value of
the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system without
adding SY was recorded. The initial concentrations of SY, Tris, Co(II),
and H2O2 were 20 mg/L, 3, 0.01, and 5 mM, respectively.
The SY degradation experiment was processed in a 100 mL beaker under
stirring at room temperature. TOC values of each degradation system
were obtained with five parallel repeats.

Degradation Procedures
All of the experiments were
performed in a 100 mL beaker under constant magnetic stirring at room
temperature and in a normal atmosphere. Typically, the reactions were
triggered by adding 50 μL of 10 mM Co(II), 150 μL of 1
M Tris, and 250 μL of 1 M H2O2 solution
into 50 mL of SY solution (20 mg/L) in sequence. The initial pH value
was adjusted with HNO3 or NaOH to investigate the pH influence
on the SY degradation efficiency. At regular intervals of 5 min, the
absorption of the degradation solution was measured using a UV-2401
PC spectrophotometer. The absorbance was used to determine the concentration
of SY through the Beer–Lambert law. Similarly, the SY degradations
in the Co(II)–H2O2, Tris–H2O2, Tris–Co(II), or only H2O2 systems were investigated according to the same procedure.
Degradation of other azo dyes was performed with the same procedure
by changing SY to other azo dyes without the change of the concentration.

Results and Discussion
Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-Like
System-Promoted Degradation of SY
As a starting point, the
degradation of SY in the Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like
system without and with Tris was investigated. Figure 1 shows the degradation curves of SY versus
time at an initial pH of 9.6 under various conditions. The decolorization
rate of the SY solution with only H2O2 was negligible
even after 50 min of reaction. Similarly, the decolorization rates
of the SY solution in the presence of the Tris–H2O2 or Tris–Co(II) system with the same reaction
time could also be ignored, suggesting that the Fenton-like system
only works with both Co(II) and H2O2.23 With the simultaneous introduction of Co(II)
and H2O2, degradation of SY was observed with
a decolorization rate of 37.0% within 50 min. Interestingly, it became
98.0% upon introducing Tris into the system, suggesting that Tris–Co(II)
chelating complex plays an important role in SY degradation in the
Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like system.

Figure 1 Time profiles of SY degradation in different systems. The initial
concentrations of SY, Co(II), Tris, and H2O2 were 20 mg/L, 0.01, 3, and 5 mM, respectively. The initial pH value
of the systems was 9.6.

Our studies also showed that the degradation of SY in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system was affected by the Tris concentration
and initial solution pH. We then conducted a systematic study to optimize
the conditions. According to Figure S1A, the SY degradation rate increased when the Tris concentration increased
from 0 to 3 mM. However, further increase of Tris led to a slight
decrease of the SY degradation rate. A possible reason is that with
the increased Tris concentration can efficiently accelerate the Co(III)/Co(II)
cycle, thereby increasing the production of •OH,
which facilitates the degradation of SY.24 The slight decrease of the SY degradation rate at higher Tris concentrations
might be attributed to the competitive consumption of •OH by excess Tris.25,26 Therefore, the degradation rate
first increased and then decreased upon increasing the Tris concentration.
Compared to the Fenton system, the Co(II)-meditated Fenton-like system
shows higher activity under alkaline conditions based on previous
reports.27 Thus, the initial solution pH
values from 7.5 to 12.0 were considered. The degradation rate showed
an initial increase and then a slight decrease upon increasing the
solution pH, and the best reaction pH was 9.6. (Figure S1B) It is well-known that the generation of •OH from the Fenton-like reaction (Co(II)–H2O2) is promoted under alkaline conditions.28,29 As shown in Figure S1B, the degradation
rate displayed an increase from pH 7.5 to 10.5. Nevertheless, it was
decreased when the pH value was higher than 10.5. It is worth noting
that H2O2 is easily decomposed into H2O and O2 in a strong alkaline solution (pH > 10.5),30 resulting in a diminished degradation rate.
On the other hand, we calculated the stability constant of the Tris–Co(II)
complex by spectrophotometry.31 1  where K is the stability
constant of the Tris–Co(II) complex, X is
the concentration of the Tris–Co(II) catalyst at equilibrium
(mol/L), n is the coordination number of the Tris–Co(II) catalyst
(the stoichiometry of the Tris–Co(II) catalyst between Co(II)
and Tris was determined by the continuous variation method to be 1:3),32a is the concentration of Co(II)
(mol/L), and b is the concentration of Tris (mol/L).
As shown in Figure S2, the total concentrations
of Co(II) and Tris were maintained as 0.01 mol/L (red) and 0.005 mol/L
(black). When the absorbance is 0.6, the concentrations of Co(II)
and Tris of the two solution compositions are a1 = 1.3 × 10–6 mol/L, b1 = 8.7 × 10–6 mol/L and a2 = 1.0 × 10–6 mol/L, b2 = 4.0 × 10–6 mol/L,
respectively. The value of K obtained from eq 1 is 1.87 × 1014. When the Tris–Co(II) complex is in equilibrium,
it is calculated that free [Co2+] in the solution is 2
× 10–12 mol/L. According to literature surveys,33 the Ksp of Co(OH)2 is 2.5 × 10–16. The value of free
[OH–] was calculated to be 10–2 mol/L. Therefore, Co(OH)2 will precipitate at pH = 12,
which inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species. Taken together,
the highest degradation rate is achieved when the Tris concentration
is 3 mM and the initial solution pH is 9.6. It is noticed that most
of the SY (>95.0%) could be degraded within 50 min of reaction time
at an initial pH from 9.6 to 12.0, indicating that this approach is
remarkably capable for the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewaters,
since the pH values of the wastewaters are always alkaline.34

Mechanism of Tris–Co(II) Catalyst-Enhanced Degradation
of SY
To prove that the Tris–Co(II) catalyst promoted
SY degradation, the mineralization efficiency of SY under optimal
conditions was investigated by a TOC analysis.35,36 Notice that the introduction of Tris can dramatically enhance the
TOC value of the solution; the TOC background from Tris needs to be
excluded. To obtain the mineralization rate of SY with the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system, the TOC values of the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 solution with and without SY during reaction
were accordingly recorded. The difference between these two values
stands for the net TOC of SY. The initial TOC value of Tris was 137.3
mg/L, while only 2.3% of it was mineralized within 80 min (Figure S3). To achieve a high mineralization
efficiency, continuous addition of H2O2 three
times was conducted (Figure 2A). Despite this, the TOC removal efficiency of the SY–Co(II)–H2O2 solution without or with Tris increased with
the progress of the reaction. However, it was much faster in the SY–Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 solution. The mineralization efficiency was
11.0% in the SY–Co(II)–H2O2 solution;
however, it became 59.4% in the SY–Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 solution. The dramatic TOC variation revealed
that the Tris–Co(II) catalyst-promoted SY degradation might
be attributed to the high mineralization efficiency. Such a high TOC
removal efficiency of our proposed degradation system is better than
those of some previously reported works using small molecules as chelators.37 In addition, the production of sulfate was largely
enhanced with the addition of Tris. According to Figure 2B, the sulfate concentrations
in the SY–Co(II)–H2O2 and SY–Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 solutions after reaction were 3.6 and 10.6 μM,
respectively. Since sulfate can only generate from the oxidation of
the sulfonic group of SY, the higher the sulfate concentration, the
higher the degradation efficiency.38 It
should be referred that nitrate was not considered in ion chromatograph
measurements because cobalt nitrate was used as a Co(II) source. Meanwhile,
the concentrations of HCOOH and CH3COOH were 213.9 and
38.8 μM upon adding Tris, which may originate from the degradation
of Tris. These small molecules are nontoxic and biodegradable, and
do not need to be further treated.

after 50 min of reaction in the Co(II)–H2O2 (black) and Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 (red) systems.

Although •OH is the major component in Fenton-like
reactions, other reactive oxygen species including superoxide anion
(O2•–) and singlet oxygen (1O2) also exist. To find out as to which one is
responsible for SY degradation, three reactive oxygen species scavengers
(thiourea for •OH, superoxide dismutase (SOD) for
O2•–, and NaN3 for 1O2) were investigated.39−42 As shown in Figure S4, the addition of NaN3 showed negligible
inhibition to SY degradation, suggesting that 1O2 is not involved in the direct degradation process. In contrast,
thiourea and SOD caused distinct suppressions to SY degradation (Figure 3), indicating that •OH and O2•– are
responsible for the effective SY degradation. In comparison to SOD,
thiourea led to ∼90.0% inhibition of SY degradation, implying
that •OH is the major species that degrades SY.

Figure 3 Time profiles of the SY degradation in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system upon adding various concentrations of
thiourea (A) and SOD (B).

To understand how Tris affects the production of •OH and O2•– in the Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like system process, we quantified •OH in the absence and presence of Tris using a classical
Babbs method based on a previous report.43 The reaction between DMSO and •OH can produce
methane sulfinic acid (MSA), a stable compound. Then, MSA interacts
with Fast Blue BB salt and produces yellow diazosulfone, which leads
to an increase of the characteristic absorption band at 425 nm. The
absorbance at 425 nm was measured with an interval of 5 min and was
used to represent the amount of produced MSA for each period. According
to Figures 4A and S5, the production of •OH in
Co(II)–H2O2 system mostly occurred in
the initial 5 min. In contrast, •OH was unremittingly
generated within 50 min in the presence of Tris. The total content
of •OH in the Co(II)–H2O2 and Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 systems
within a 50 min period were calculated to be 1.3 and 3.4 μmol,
respectively. These results indicated that Tris not only promotes
the continuous generation but also the yield of •OH. Accordingly, the production of O2•– was quantified using the NBT method based on the absorbance decrease
at 259 nm.44,45 As shown in Figures 4B and S6, the yield of O2•– in
the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system is
much higher than that in the Co(II)–H2O2 system. Interestingly, the production of •OH is
proportional to the yield of O2•–, suggesting that O2•– may be
involved in the •OH production process. It is reported
that O2•– acts as a reductant
in the Fenton-like system, which is important to the redox-active
Co(III)/Co(II) conversion.46 A similar
role of O2•– was found in other
Fenton-like systems. Sun et al. have reported that O2•– can reduce Fe(III)-chelates to Fe(II)-chelates
in the Fe(III)–NTA–Mn2+ Fenton-like system
and subsequently increase the generation rate of •OH from the reaction between Fe(II)–NTA complexes and H2O2.26 We thus speculate
that the generated O2•– would
accelerate the reduction of the Tris–Co(III) complex to the
Tris–Co(II) complex and facilitate the generation of •OH (Scheme 1). It
was found that extra addition of certain Co(II) to the SY–Co(II)–H2O2 system with a fixed interval also enhanced the
degradation efficiency of SY (Figure 4C), further proving the importance of the Co(II) content
to the generation of •OH and the following SY degradation.
Additionally, this speculation was verified by measuring •OH production in the presence of NBT. As illustrated in Figure 4D, the addition of
a low concentration of NBT significantly inhibited •OH production due to the consumption of O2•–.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Tris–Co-catalyst-Promoted Continuous
Generation of •OH in the Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like System
In addition to the continuous production of •OH, shortening the reaction time between •OH and
the organic pollutant is also an efficient strategy to enhance the
degradation of organic pollutants.47,48 The ζ-potentials
of Tris–Co(II) complexes and SY were measured to be 7.7 and
−14.8 mV, respectively (Figure 5A). The opposite charges make them easily get close
and form a complex due to the strong electrostatic attraction. Undoubtedly,
the ζ-potential value became −2.72 mV when mixing Tris–Co(II)
complexes and SY together. The decreased ζ-potential suggests
the formation of Tris–Co(II)–SY complexes. Therefore,
the reaction time between •OH and SY is largely
shortened, which improves the degradation efficiency. As is known,
the high ionic strength environment can reduce the electrostatic interaction.49 We thus investigated the SY degradation by adding
an electrolyte (KCl). As shown in Figure 5B, the SY degradation efficiency decreased
with increasing KCl concentration, further validating the importance
of forming Tris–Co(II)–SY complexes. To better understand
the importance of the electrostatic attraction between the Tris–Co(II)
complex and SY, SY degradation by EDTA–Co(II) complexes was
also investigated. It was found that the decolorization rate of SY
solution in the EDTA–Co(II)–H2O2 system is much slower than that in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system (Figure S7), mainly because of the negative charge of the EDTA–Co(II)
complex, which shows electrostatic repulsion to SY and hinders the
approach of •OH. Similarly, the degradation of basic
red (a cationic azo dye) in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system within 50 min was negligible at pH 9.6. Interestingly,
the degradation efficiency could be greatly enhanced by increasing
the solution pH value (Figure S8), which
diminishes the electrostatic repulsion between basic red and the Tris–Co(II)
complex and facilitates their osculation. To further identify the
interaction, FT-IR spectra were analyzed. As shown in Figure S9, the S=O stretch band shifted
from 1027 to 1039 cm–1, which is due to the electrostatic
interaction between the anionic sulfonic group and the positive Tris–Co(II)
complex. These results generally demonstrate the essential role of
the electrostatic attraction between organic dyes and the Tris–Co(II)
complex for the effective degradation of organic dyes.

(2), and the mixture of SY and the Tris–Co(II) complex (3).
(B) Time profiles of the SY degradation in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system upon adding various concentrations of
KCl.

Taken together, the Tris–Co(II) catalyst-promoted SY degradation
can be divided into two parts: Tris decreases the redox potential
and facilitates the Co(III)/Co(II) conversion and continuous generation
of •OH; the strong electrostatic attraction between
Tris–Co(II) and SY shortens the reaction time and enhances
the degradation efficiency.

Cyclic Degradation of SY by the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 System
As mentioned in our investigations,
only a slight decomposition of Tris during the degradation of SY occurred,
suggesting the preservation of the Tris–Co(II) complex. Therefore,
we hypothesized that the Tris–Co(II) complex can be used for
cyclic degradation of SY upon re-addition of H2O2. As expected, the degradation rate of SY decreased with the increasing
cycle number (Figure S10A), which is due
to the continuously reduced Tris during the degradation process. However,
the high degradation efficiency (>90%) of SY was realized even after
five cycles (Figure S10B). These results
indicated the effective cyclic degradation capability of the Tris–Co(II)
complex toward SY in the presence of H2O2.

Degradation Pathway of SY in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 System
According to the above results,
the introduction of Tris into the Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like system can greatly enhance the degradation of
SY. To understand the degradation pathway, the degradation intermediates
of SY were investigated through the LC–MS technique. As shown
in Figure 6A, five
components in the LC chromatogram were observed with retention times
of 0.76, 1.05, 1.23, 1.57, and 2.83 min, respectively. The possible
structures of these components were identified from the MS data (Figure S11 and Table S1).50,51 On the basis of MS results of previous reports, these five components
were characterized as 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate ion (1), hydroxylated
derivative of 4- hydroxybenzenesulfonate ion (2), hydroxylated derivative
of 1,4,6-trihydroxy-2-naphthalenesulfonate ion (3), 1,4-naphthoquinone
(4), and cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (5), respectively. These compounds
also appeared in SY degradation with the Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like system, indicating that the introduction
of Tris did not change the degradation pathway. In addition, the continuous
changes of corresponding UV–vis absorption spectra of SY solution
were recorded to further research the degradation pathway. SY has
three characteristic absorption peaks around 482, 314, and 230 nm,
respectively (Figure 6B).50 The absorption peak in the visible
light region (482 nm) is assigned to the n−π* transition
of the azo group. However, the absorption peaks in the ultraviolet
region (314 and 230 nm) belong to the π–π* transition
of the naphthalene ring and azo bond, respectively.52 As shown in Figure 6B, the absorbance at 482 nm gradually decreased and finally
disappeared during the reaction, indicating the cleavage of the azo
bond. Despite the absorbance decrease in the UV region, the incomplete
disappearance of the absorption peaks suggests that the aromatic ring
compounds still exist within 50 min, which is consistent with the
LC–MS results.

the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system. (B)
Time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra of SY in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system.

On the basis of all of the above results and previous reports,
we proposed a possible degradation pathway of SY in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system (Scheme 2), which is very similar to that in the Co(II)–H2O2 system. First, the process is started by the
cleavage of the N=N bond of SY, which results in the generation
of 4-aminobenzenesulfonate and 5-nitro-6-hydroxy-2-naphtalenesulfonate.
Because of the high reactivity of these two intermediates, their mass
signals were not observed, which is consistent with previously reported
researches.50,51 Second, the oxidation of 4-aminobenzenesulfonate
occurs and produces compound 1 and compound 2. Meanwhile, •OH attacks the substitution of nitroso
groups on the naphthalene ring and produces compound 3. Then, the hydroxylated derivative was oxidized to form compound 4 and subsequently compound 5. Eventually, •OH oxidizes benzene compounds and cyclopentane compounds
to generate environment-friendly small-molecule organic acids and
other inorganic species including CO2, H2O,
sulfate, etc.

Scheme 2 Possible SY Degradation Pathway in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 Fenton-like System
Universality of Anionic Azo Dye Degradation with the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 System
The high SY degradation efficiency
of the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system
suggests that this system might be capable of degradation of other
anionic azo dyes. The universality of the proposed Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system was evaluated with another two anionic
azo dyes, reactive red and congo red. As shown in Figure 7, both reactive red and congo
red exhibited an extremely low degradation efficiency (< 20.0%)
within 60 min reaction time in the Co(II)–H2O2 system. However, they became 80.0% and 99.0% in the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system. These results suggested that the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system is expandable for promoting the degradation
of other anionic azo dyes. In comparison to SY, both reactive red
and congo red showed a lower degradation rate. A possible reason is
that the additional amine-motif in reactive red and congo red reduces
their negative charge and subsequently weakens the interaction between
the dye and the Tris–Co(II) complex. This assumption was proved
by ζ-potential measurements of reactive red and congo red. The
ζ-potentials of reactive red and congo red were −9.4
and −3.6 mV, which are lower than that of SY. Meanwhile, the
degradation rate of reactive red was faster than that of congo red,
which is consistent with the ζ-potential results. Therefore,
we can claim that the Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system can be applied for the efficient degradation of anionic
azo dyes.

Figure 7 Time profiles of the reactive red (A) and congo red (B) degradation
in the Co(II)–H2O2 (black line) and Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 (red line) systems. The initial concentrations
of dyes, Co(II), Tris, and H2O2 were 20 mg/L,
0.01 mM, 3 mM, and 5 mM, respectively. The initial pH value of the
systems was 9.6.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have proposed a simple Tris–Co(II)–H2O2 system for effective SY degradation under alkaline
conditions. The enhanced degradation efficiency is based on the integration
of the Tris-promoted Co(III)/Co(II) conversion and the formation of
the Tris–Co(II)–SY complex via strong electrostatic
attraction, which facilitates the continuous generation of •OH and shortens the reaction time. The universality of the presented
strategy is validated by the high degradation efficiencies of other
anionic azo dyes, reactive red and congo red. Our study demonstrates
efficient organic contaminant degradation via the integration of durative
generation of •OH and electrostatic attraction,
and thus, new avenues for the design of highly effective systems for
homogeneous and/or heterogeneous Fenton/Fenton-like degradation of
organic pollutants or catalytic reaction based on a similar strategy
may now be possible in the environmental and chemistry-related fields.
