We report the synthesis of an electrically
conductive and magnetically
active hybrid biocomposite comprising collagen and polyaniline (PAni)
as the matrix and iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as the filler through
an in situ polymerization technique. Here, the matrix biopolymer,
collagen, was extracted from trimmed wastes of animal hides generated
from the leather industry. The as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
powder possesses excellent electrical conductivity, thermal stability,
and saturation magnetization, thereby providing scope for a wide range
of applications. We show that the bifunctional composite has an ability
to conduct electrons using a light emitting diode and battery setup,
degrade dye under sunlight owing to its inherent photocatalytic activity,
and absorb oil from oil–water mixtures with easier collection
under magnetic tracking. We also demonstrate that the composite has
remarkable electromagnetic interference shielding in the X-band frequency
range. The results suggest that biowastes can be converted into useful
high-value hybrid materials for applications in catalysis, biological,
electronic, and environmental fields, thereby presenting a scalable
and sustainable approach.

1 Introduction
Functional
materials with diverse properties are in great demand
for a wide range of applications.1−3 Composites are ideally
suitable to attain the desirable multifunctionality by the precise
assembly of specific materials to get the broad spectrum of desired
properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetism, thermal stability,
mechanical stability, biodegradability, and biostability. Approaches
have been made to develop composites with complex nanoscale features
for catalysis,4,5 water treatment,6,7 heavy-metal removal,8 oil spill remediation,9 and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding
applications.10,11 Polyaniline (PAni) is the most
widely used intrinsically conducting polymer in several applications
because of its relatively facile processability, mechanical flexibility,
low cost, excellent electrical conductivity, and environmental stability.12,13 Several studies have been carried out using PAni for sensors, light
emitting diodes (LEDs), photocatalysis, EMI shielding, electrostatic
discharge (ESD) protection, capacitors, and battery applications.14−19 PAni-decorated cellulose aerogel nanocomposites showed a better
methylene blue dye degradation through the photocatalytic activity.4 In situ polymerized PAni/multiwalled carbon nanotube
(MWCNT) composites exhibited an absorption-dominant total shielding
effectiveness (SE) of 39.2 dB in the Ku-band frequency.10 PAni-functionalized MWCNT/polystyrene composites
displayed a total SE of −23.3 dB.11 Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are immensely applied in the field
of terabit magnetic storage devices, catalysis, sensors, color imaging,
electromagnetic shielding, and high-sensitivity biomolecular magnetic
resonance imaging for medical diagnosis and therapeutics.20−24 However, these applications require a coating of IONPs through the
polymeric compounds to improve the stability and dispensability of
the particles.21,25 The blending of IONPs with the
conducting polymer matrix enhanced their stability and applicability
in the photocatalysis, oil absorption and removal, and electromagnetic
shielding.26,27 The incorporation of IONP/polypyrrole
with an epoxy resin matrix showed an enhanced EMI absorption shielding
effectiveness of 10.1 dB at 17–18 GHz.28

Collagen (C) is an abundant fibrous protein with weak antigenicity
and excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability properties.29,30 It has been widely used in tissue engineering and biomedical applications.30 Its high biodegradability property compared
to other synthetic polymeric matrices such as poly(2,5-dimethoxyaniline),
polyimide, and epoxies could be exploited as a potential biopolymeric
matrix for various environmentally sustainable applications. On the
other hand, enormous quantities of collagenous solid wastes are generated
from leather industries.31 The utilization
of collagen from the wastes reduces the environmental impact and also
provides economic returns. For instance, we have shown a promising
oil absorption and removal application using iron oxide-stabilized
collagen matrices based on the concept of utilizing an industrial
waste to remove another waste.6,32 Recently, we also reported
the synthesis of collagen/polypyrrole hybrid aerogel with enhanced
biostability and good electrical conductivity.33 However, the electrical conductivity attained by the hybrid
aerogel is not sufficient for the effective shielding of the electromagnetic
radiation. Here, we synthesized a hybrid biocomposite powder with
high electrical conductivity and magnetic properties using the compositions
of collagen, PAni, and IONPs through an in situ chemical oxidative
polymerization technique. The induced high electrical and magnetic
properties enrich the composite functionality to possess a synergistic
EMI shielding protection and magnetic field-assisted effluent treatment
capabilities. The composite powder may act as a hybrid conductive
filler in insulating matrices or a coating over the insulating components
of electronic appliances for EMI shielding and ESD protection. The
as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposites were investigated
for structural, electrical, thermal, magnetic, photocatalytic, oil
absorption and removal, and EMI shielding studies.

2 Results and Discussion
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra of pure collagen, PAni,
IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite are shown in Figure 1a–d. The FTIR spectrum
of the pure collagen depicts the characteristic peaks at 3318, 1653,
1545, and 1240 cm–1 corresponding to hydroxyl, amide
I, amide II, and amide III groups, respectively (Figure 1a),33 whereas the pure PAni exhibits the characteristic bands at around
1583 and 1493 cm–1 corresponding to the C–C
stretching of quinoid and benzenoid rings, respectively, which indicates
the conducting state of doped PAni structures (Figure 1b).10 The peaks
at 1290, 1183, 1032, and 711 cm–1 correspond to
the C–N stretching of the secondary aromatic amine, aromatic
C–H in-plane bending, stretching vibration of SO3– of the dopant, and out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations, respectively
(Figure 1b).34 The FTIR spectrum of IONPs depicts the characteristic
peak at 582 cm–1 corresponding to the Fe–O
vibration, whereas the bands at 1128, 1392, and 1623 cm–1 are due to the C–O stretching, symmetric stretching, and
asymmetric stretching of COO– of citrate, respectively
(Figure 1c).21

Figure 1 FTIR and XRD spectra of the constituent materials and
the hybrid
biocomposite. (a,e) Collagen, (b,f) PAni, (c,g) IONP, and (d,h) C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite.

FTIR spectrum of the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite exhibits
the
major peaks at 1582, 1494, 1294, 1230, 1149, 1031, 709, and 570 cm–1 (Figure 1d). The bands at 1582, 1494, 1294, 1149, 1031, and 709 cm–1 correspond to the characteristic peaks of the C–C
stretching of quinoid and benzenoid rings, C–N stretching,
C–H in-plane bending, SO3– stretching vibrations,
and out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations of the PAni polymer,
respectively, whereas the peaks at 1230 and 570 cm–1 correspond to the amide III group of collagen and the Fe–O
vibration of IONPs, respectively. It is interesting to note that the
other characteristic peaks of collagen and IONPs are not visible in
the hybrid biocomposite spectrum (Figure 1d). This may be due to the coating of PAni
over the collagen and IONP molecules, equivalent to a core–shell
type of structure. Hence, the polymerization of PAni dominates the
surface characteristics of the core molecules, collagen and IONPs,
in the composite matrix. This is further evidenced in the results
of the FTIR spectra.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
pure collagen, PAni, IONP,
and C/PAni/IONP hybrid composite are shown in Figure 1e–h. As can be seen, the pure collagen
exhibits a broad diffraction peak at 21°, which may be due to
the amorphous nature of pristine collagen molecules (Figure 1e).33 The characteristic diffraction peaks of PAni seen at 15, 20, and
25° correspond to the (011), (020), and (200) planes of the emeraldine
salt form of the orthorhombic crystalline PAni polymer (Figure 1f).35 The IONP pattern shows sharp and intense diffraction peaks at 30,
35, 43, 57, and 62° corresponding to the (220), (311), (400),
(511), and (440) reflections, which match well with those of cubic
Fe3O4 (magnetite, JCPDS no. 85-1436) (Figure 1g).36 On the other hand, the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
exhibits the major characteristic peaks of PAni and IONP molecules
(Figure 1h). The intense
peaks at the 2θ values of 12, 19, and 25° correspond to
the (011), (020), and (200) planes of PAni, whereas the peaks at 30,
35, 42, 56, and 62° correspond to the (220), (311), (400), (511),
and (440) reflections of Fe3O4 (Figure 1h). It is also interesting
to note a small hump in the 2θ regions between 20 and 25°,
which may be due to the amorphous collagen molecules in the composite
matrix (Figure 1h).
These XRD results also confirm the presence of collagen, PAni, and
IONPs in the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite.

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) patterns of pure collagen, PAni,
IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid composite are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the TGA curves
of collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid composite show a multistage
decomposition. The first stage is due to the evaporation of water
molecules in the samples. The pure collagen and the functionalized
IONPs exhibit only the second stage of decomposition with the inflection
points at 331 and 325 °C, respectively (Figure 2a,c), primarily because of the destruction
of the macromolecular structure of collagen and the coating layers
of the functionalized IONPs.37,38 The doped PAni, on
the other hand, exhibited the second, third, and fourth stages of
decomposition with the inflection points at 285, 419, and 616 °C,
respectively (Figure 2b). The weight loss at 285 °C is due to the loss of bound water
(secondary dopant) and the decomposition of primary dopants and low-molecular-weight
polymeric chains (oligomers),39,40 whereas the weight
losses at 419 and 616 °C are associated with the complete decomposition
of the polymeric chain.39,40 It is interesting to
notice that the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite shows second, third,
fourth, and fifth stages of decomposition with the inflection points
at 272, 319, 484, and 667 °C, respectively (Figure 2d) because of the presence
of moisture, collagen, PAni, and the citrate-coated IONPs in the hybrid
biocomposite. The fourth and fifth stages of decomposition in the
hybrid biocomposite have substantially enhanced inflection points
compared to its constituent materials. The residual (37.1%) in the
hybrid composite (Figure 2d) is assigned to the magnetic nanoparticles, which are characterized
by their high thermal stability. Hence, the results demonstrate that
the existence of PAni and the IONP improved the thermal stability
in the as-prepared C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite.

collagen, (b) PAni, (c) IONP, and (d) C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite.

Figure 3a–d
shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and digital images of
pure collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite. As
can be observed, the pristine collagen exhibits a fairly smooth surface,
whereas PAni exhibits a tubular morphology with an average particle
width of 5 ± 2 μm (Figure 3a,b). The tubular morphology of PAni may be due to
the large size of the dopant and the anthraquinone ring in the polymeric
structure.41 The citrate-coated IONPs displayed
a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 26 ±
6 nm (Figure 3c), whereas
the as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite exhibits a sheathlike
structure, predominantly because of the morphologies of PAni and collagen
(Figure 3d). The spherical
IONPs are distributed uniformly on the surface of the C/PAni/IONP
composite and probably coated by the collagen/PAni polymers, as can
be seen in the higher magnification SEM image (Figure S1). The particle size distribution of the as-synthesized
PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP composite is shown in Figure 3e–g. As can be seen,
the PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP composites exhibited average particle
sizes of 1709 ± 34.5, 43.1 ± 1.08, and 854.6 ± 9.19
nm, respectively (Figure 3e–g). Compared with the average particle size determined
from the SEM image, the IONPs exhibited a slightly bigger particle
size, which may be due to the agglomeration of the nanoparticles.

samples. Particle size distributions of (e) PAni, (f) IONP, and (g)

Room-temperature magnetization curves of IONP and C/PAni/IONP
hybrid
biocomposite are shown in Figure 4, and those for pure collagen and PAni are shown in Figure S2. As can be observed, the IONPs show
a ferromagnetic-like hysteresis curve with a saturation magnetization
value of 26.1 emu/g (Figure 4a). This value is lower compared with that of the bulk iron
oxide because of the small particle size of the nanoparticles and
the citrate coating.42 The as-synthesized
C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite exhibited a saturation magnetization
value of 8.32 emu/g (Figure 4b). The low saturation magnetization of the hybrid biocomposite
is primarily due to the diamagnetic nature of collagen and PAni polymers
(Figure S2a,b), which form a major composition
in the composite and also coat the IONPs (Figure S1). Coating of IONPs by the diamagnetic polymers is expected
to reduce the saturation magnetization of IONPs. This results in the
low saturation magnetization for the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite.
Further, the lower saturation magnetization value of the as-synthesized
functionalized IONPs as a result of their small particle size42 also contributes to the low saturation magnetization
value of the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite.

Figure 4 Room-temperature magnetization
curves of (a) IONP and (b) C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite. The insets show the attraction of the particles
to a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets (∼1000 Oe).

The electrical conductivities
of the pure PAni and the as-synthesized
C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite are 2.84 × 10–2 and 2.44 × 10–2 S/cm, respectively, which
are much higher than those of the pure collagen and IONPs (displaying 5.34 × 10–12 and 7.64 × 10–5 S/cm, respectively).
In order to understand the impact of these values, we carried out
an experiment employing a LED lamp and battery setup (Figure 5). When the samples were inserted
between the batteries, it can be visibly noticed that the pure collagen
scaffold did not illuminate the LED light, whereas the IONPs displayed
a low extent of brightness. This may be due to the insulating nature
of collagen and the semiconducting nature of IONPs (Figure 5a,c). On the other hand, the
as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite exhibited a substantially
brighter illumination nearly comparable to that of PAni (Figure 5b,d), which has the
highest brightness. The extent of brightness is predominantly dependent
on the content of PAni in the composite matrix. The enhanced electrical
conductivity in the as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
is expected to have potential applications in sensors, bioelectronics,
and EMI shielding.

lamp and
battery setup. (a) Pure collagen, (b) PAni, (c) IONP, and (d) C/PAni/IONP

and LED lamp and battery setups.

The photocatalytic activity of the constituent materials
and the
C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite was evaluated by analyzing their efficiency
of methylene blue dye degradation under visible-light irradiation
monitored through UV–visible (UV–vis) absorbance spectra.
The UV–vis absorption spectra and the percentage of methylene
blue degradation of the control (without catalyst), collagen, PAni,
IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite are shown in Figure 6. As can be observed, the methylene
blue degradation using the pure collagen scaffold is only up to 7%
at the end of 2 h incubation, which is also similar to that of the
control (without catalyst) (Figure 6a,b,f). It clearly shows that the pure collagen scaffold
does not have any photocatalytic behavior on the methylene blue degradation,
whereas the pure PAni and IONP enhanced the methylene blue degradation
up to 49 and 68%, respectively, at the end of 2 h incubation (Figure 6c,d,f). On the other
hand, the as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite demonstrates
a maximum methylene blue degradation of 81% at the end of 2 h incubation
(Figure 6e,f). It is
also important to note that the time required for the maximum degradation
of the dye is about 20 min beyond which there is no significant degradation
occurred. These results suggest that the as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite powder has a great potential in the treatment
of dye wastewater with the help of magnetic separation.

(d) IONP, and (e) C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite and (f) percent
of methylene blue dye degradation of all samples as a function of
time.

During the photocatalytic dye
degradation process using the C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite, PAni sensitizes the IONPs in the visible region
and the IONPs in return help the charge separation in PAni and facilitate
the formation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.43,44 These superoxide and hydroxyl radicals attack, degrade, and mineralize
the dye. The whole process is shown in Figure S3. As can be seen, because the conduction band of IONPs and
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of PAni are well-matched
for the charge transfer, the electrons promoted from the π–π*
absorption band of PAni upon natural light irradiation are easily
injected into the conduction band of the IONPs while electrons in
the valence band (VB) of the IONPs are transferred into PAni and left
holes (h+) in the VB, which can yield superoxide and hydroxyl
radicals on the surface and at the interface of IONPs and PAni/IONP,
respectively, leading to the enhanced catalytic activity.

The
oil absorption and removal ability of the as-synthesized
C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite from the oil–water mixture is shown in Figure 7. As can be seen,
the oil was completely removed from the oil–water mixture within
30 s of incubation (Figure 7a–d). A permanent magnet (∼1000 Oe) was used
to track the sample to absorb more oil from other oil-contaminated
area. The sample pellet was withdrawn from the mixture using the permanent
magnet and weighed to determine the oil absorption capability of the
sample. It was found that the as-synthesized hybrid biocomposite powder
exhibits an oil absorption capability up to 2.1 g/g, which is comparable
to those of previously reported magnetic biocomposite materials6 and better than those of previously reported
oil-absorbing composite powders.45,46 It is imperative
to note that the oil absorption of the hybrid biocomposite is mainly
due to the existence of IONP-stabilized collagen in the composite
matrix, which has good oleophilic nature and porosity.32 The results show that the C/PAni/IONP hybrid
biocomposite has a great potential for the absorption and removal
of oil from the oil-contaminated environment assisted with magnetic
separation.

Electromagnetic waves comprise both electric and
magnetic fields
at right angle to each other. EMI shielding is the attenuation of
a propagating electromagnetic wave by blocking the fields with barriers
made of conductive or magnetic materials. Hence, it is logical to
employ a bifunctional material having both electrical conductivity
and magnetic properties as a shield. When an incident electromagnetic
wave attempts to pass through the shield, phenomena such as reflection,
absorption, and transmission or multiple reflection may occur, which
are due to the interaction with the charge carriers and magnetic dipoles
of the shield (Figure 8a).47 Hence, the total SE (SET) is the summation of contributions from absorption (SEA), reflection (SER), and transmission or multiple reflection
(SEM), which can be written as SET (dB) = SEA + SER + SEM. However, when SET > 15 dB for a single layer of the shielding material, then SEM can be neglected (SET (dB) ≈ SEA + SER). As can be observed in Figure 8b–d, the as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP
composite exhibits total SE (SET) in the range from 22
to 25.6 dB at 8 GHz and from 20 to 21.5 dB at 12 GHz for the samples
with thicknesses from 1 to 2 mm. It is evident that the SE of the
C/PAni/IONP composite gradually increased as the sample thickness
increases. It is also intriguing to note that the total SE of the
sample is mainly due to the absorption component rather than reflection.
The key mechanism of EMI shielding is typically reflection due to
the interaction of the EMI radiation with the free electrons on the
surface of the shielding material.48 Absorption
occurs when the electric or magnetic dipoles of the shield material
interact with the electromagnetic waves. For higher magnetic permeability
shielding materials, which provide a magnetic dipole, shielding by
reflection decreases while the absorption component increases.49 Highly conducting materials such as carbon nanotubes
shield majorly by reflection rather than absorption.50 Conversely, hybrid composite materials with magnetic and
conducting properties impart EMI shielding predominantly by absorption.51 A similar mechanism is expected here as well
for our C/PAni/IONP composite material because of its inherent bifunctional
properties.

Figure 8 (a) Schematic showing the interaction of electromagnetic wave with
the shielding material; EMI SE of the as-synthesized C/PAni/IONP composite
at various thicknesses from (b) 1 mm (c) to 1.5 mm to (d) 2 mm measured
in the frequency range of 8–12 GHz (X-band).

The return loss and SE of the C/PAni/IONP composite
are shown in Table S2. Return loss is the
transmission of
electromagnetic radiation through the materials due to the increased
impedance mismatch between the shield and free space.52 The high return loss results in a lower SE of the sample.52,53 It is observed that the C/PAni/IONP composite gradually reduces
the return loss as the sample thickness increases. The results also
show that the C/PAni/IONP composite exhibits average total SE values
of 20.6, 21.7, and 22.8 dB at 1, 1.5, and 2 mm sample thicknesses,
respectively, in the X-band frequency range (8–12 GHz). In
general, a total SE value of 20 dB is required for laptops and desktop
computers and other commercial electronic appliances.50 The SE value of 20 dB indicates that the shielding material
is capable of blocking 99% electromagnetic radiation.50 Hence, the results demonstrate that the prepared C/PAni/IONP
composite can be a potential candidate for the EMI shielding of commercial
electronic appliances.

3 Conclusions
An electrically
conductive and magnetically active hybrid biocomposite
was synthesized using an in situ oxidative polymerization technique
with the compositions of collagen, PAni, and IONP for heterogeneous
applications. The prepared C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite powder
showed an excellent electrical conductivity and a saturation magnetization
of 2.44 × 10–2 S/cm and 8.32 emu/g, respectively,
with good thermal stability. The electrical conductivity of the hybrid
biocomposite was demonstrated through a simple LED lamp and battery
setup, showing a decent brightness, which indicates the less obstruction
of current flow in the composite matrix. The prepared hybrid biocomposite
exhibits a significant photocatalytic activity toward the degradation
of methylene blue up to 81% within the period of 2 h. It also showed
an effective oil absorption and removal from the oil–water
mixture. This study also reveals that the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
exhibited an absorption-dominant EMI SE surpassing 20 dB in the X-band
frequency range of 8–12 GHz at a minimum thickness of the sample.
Hence, the prepared C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite has potential
for a wide range of applications such as biosensors, photocatalysis,
oil absorption, and EMI shielding, thereby demonstrating a sustainable
approach for the effective usage of biowastes.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Trimmed wastes from cowhide
were obtained from the pilot tannery at the CSIR-Central Leather Research
Institute, Chennai. Aniline, ferric chloride (FeCl3), ammonium
persulfate (APS), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O), anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid sodium salt (AQSA-Na), trisodium
citrate, and sodium hydroxide were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, India.
All other reagents used were of analytical grade.

4.2 Synthesis of IONPs
The functionalized
water-dispersible IONPs were synthesized according to the protocol
of Wang et al. without employing any solvent.21 Briefly, 0.32 g of FeCl3, 0.28 g of FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.5 g of trisodium citrate were blended thoroughly
using a mortar and pestle. Subsequently, 0.32 g of NaOH was mixed
into the reaction mixture with continuous grinding for 10 min. Finally,
the reaction mixture was washed with distilled water and centrifuged
at 12 000 rpm for 30 min to remove the unreacted molecules.
The collected functionalized IONPs were dried at room temperature
and then ground to make a fine powder.

4.3 Synthesis
of C/PAni/IONP Hybrid Biocomposite
The schematic of the synthesis
of PAni and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
is shown in Figure 9. Briefly, the collected rawhide trimmed pieces were soaked, limed,
dehaired, relimed, fleshed, and delimed as per conventional leather
processing procedures.33 The delimed hide
pieces were dehydrated in 35 and 70% acetone for 3 h, followed by
100% methanol five times each 3 h duration to completely remove the
moisture. The solvent-dehydrated trimmed pieces were thoroughly dried
in a
vacuum drier and ground into powder using a Wiley Mill of 2 mm mesh
size. About 10 g of the hide powder was weighed and blended in 500
mL of 0.5 M glacial acetic acid at 4 °C.

Figure 9 Schematic showing the
synthesis of (a) pure PAni and (b) C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite.

From this solution, 100 mL of collagen was taken in a clean
vial
and stirred with different concentrations of aniline from 0 to 1 (weight
ratios with respect to collagen) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently,
a fixed 1:1 weight ratio of IONPs dispersed in deionized water was
added dropwise to the collagen/aniline mixture under continuous stirring
for 30 min at 35 °C. A mixture of aqueous solutions of AQSA-Na
dopant (1:1 molar ratio of dopant/monomer) and APS oxidant (1:2 molar
ratio of oxidant/monomer) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture
to initiate the polymerization process. The reaction mixture was kept
under constant stirring at 6 ± 2 °C for 4 h. After the completion
of polymerization, the synthesized dark green C/PAni/IONP precipitates
were collected and washed with distilled water three times. Finally,
the collected C/PAni/IONP precipitates were freeze-dried into powder,
measured for electrical conductivity, and stored. For further characterizations,
the 1:1:1 weight ratio composition of the C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
was selected based on its highest conductivity value, as shown in Table S1.

4.4 Characterization
of the Constituent Materials
and the C/PAni/IONP Hybrid Biocomposite
FTIR spectroscopic
analysis of the as-synthesized collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite was carried out using a JASCO FTIR-4200 spectrometer.
The samples were ground into powder, mixed with KBr, and pressed to
form pellets. The pellets were analyzed in a single-beam mode with
an average of four scans and 1 cm–1 resolution.
XRD analysis of the as-synthesized collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite was carried out using a Rigaku Miniflex (II) desktop
diffractometer (Ni filtered with Cu Kα radiation with λ
= 0.15418 nm) at the 2θ range of 10–80° at a scan
speed of 4°/min and a sampling step of 0.02°. The TGA of
the as-synthesized collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite
was carried out using a PerkinElmer (TGA Q50, V20.6 Build 31) analyzer
in the temperature range of 25–800 °C. The heating rate
was maintained at 20 °C/min under the nitrogen flow of 40 mL/min.
The structural morphology of the as-synthesized collagen, PAni, IONP,
and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite was analyzed using an FEI Quanta
200 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 20
KV in different magnifications. The samples were coated with gold
using an Edwards E306 sputter coater before the analysis. The particle
size of the PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite was measured
using a Nanotrac wave IIQ particle size analyzer (Microtrac). The
magnetic properties of the as-prepared collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite were measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM, Lakeshore, 7407 model) at room temperature.

4.5 Electrical Conductivity of the Constituent
Materials and the C/PAni/IONP Hybrid Biocomposite
The electrical
conductivity of the prepared collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite was analyzed by a two-probe method using a Prestige
4.5 Digital Micro-Ohm meter (Prestige Electronics, Mumbai, India)
at room temperature. The powder samples were compressed to circular
pellets with a thickness of 3.0 ± 0.2 mm and a diameter of 2.5
cm before the analysis. The conductivity (σ) of the pelletized
samples was calculated using eq 1. 1  

The electrical conductivity of the
pure collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid biocomposite was
also demonstrated through the LED lamp and battery setup. The sample
pellets were placed between the four alkaline batteries (LR41, 1.5
V each) and connected to an LED (5 mm length, 2.1 V) lamp unit. The
illuminated LED lamp was photographed using a digital camera (Sony,
Cyber-shot, DSC-WX200).

4.6 Photocatalytic Activity
of the Constituent
Materials and the C/PAni/IONP Hybrid Biocomposite
The photocatalytic
activity of the prepared collagen, PAni, IONP, and C/PAni/IONP hybrid
biocomposite was measured by the degradation of methylene blue under
the irradiation of natural light condition. Briefly, 150 mg of the
powder sample was immersed in 100 mL of methylene blue solution (10
mg/L) and stirred under the sunlight. At regular intervals, 1 mL of
the reaction medium was taken to measure the degradation of methylene
blue using the UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu).
The absorbance of the characteristic wavelength of methylene blue
was recorded, and its degradation percentage was estimated according
to eq 2. The powder sample
was recovered from the treated water using permanent magnets (∼1000
Oe) utilizing the magnetic property of the biocomposite. 2  

4.7 Oil Absorption and Removal Studies of the
C/PAni/IONP Hybrid Biocomposite
Oil absorption and removal
were carried out by immersing a known weight of the C/PAni/IONP hybrid
biocomposite pellet (manually pressed to a cylindrical shape with
5 mm diameter and 4 mm height) into the mixture of distilled water
and used motor engine oil. The oil-absorbed sample pellet was tracked
in the mixture using the permanent magnet (∼1000 Oe) to absorb
more oil in other oil-contaminated area. The amount of oil absorbed
by the sample was calculated by subtracting the initial weight from
the final oil-absorbed weight. Digital photographic images were also
taken at different time intervals to demonstrate the capability of
oil absorption and removal by the hybrid biocomposite.

4.8 EMI Shielding Studies of the C/PAni/IONP Hybrid
Biocomposite
The EMI shielding measurements of the C/PAni/IONP
hybrid biocomposite were taken using an N5230A vector network analyzer
at the X-band frequency range of 8–12 GHz. The hybrid biocomposite
powder was compressed to form 22.86 × 10.16 mm2 rectangular
pellets with thicknesses of 1, 1.5, and 2 mm. The SE due to reflection
(SER) and absorption (SEA) and the total SE
(SET) were calculated using eqs 3–5.53 3   4   5
