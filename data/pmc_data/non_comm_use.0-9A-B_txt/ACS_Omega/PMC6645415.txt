The electronic, transport, optical,
thermoelectric, and thermodynamic
properties of the two-dimensional (2D) stable monolayer of boron arsenide
(BAs) sheets have been investigated using state-of-art theoretical
calculations. The energetic, dynamic, thermal, and mechanical stability
of the BAs sheet have also been studied to unravel the feasibility
of experimental realization of this material. Interestingly, the band
gap of this semiconducting sheet changes from direct into indirect
band gap material by the application of biaxial strain of 10% and
it becomes metallic at 14% of biaxial strain. Furthermore, positive
phonon vibrational modes have been observed for all applied biaxial
strains, which ensure the stability of the sheet under strain. The
semiconducting property is preserved when cutting 2D sheet into one-dimensional
nanoribbons, and the band gap is size dependent. In addition, the
calculated optical properties exhibit strong anisotropy. BAs nanomaterial
has strong adsorption in the UV–visible region. The calculated
Seebeck coefficient and power factor values show that BAs sheet is
an ideal candidate for thermal management and thermoelectric applications.
Finally, the thermodynamic properties have been calculated on the
basis of the phonon frequencies. These rich properties of BAs nanosheets
endow the system with promising applications in nanoelectronics and
photovoltaics.

Introduction
The invention of graphene,1 h-BN,2 transition-metal
dichalcogenides3,4 (TMDC), and other two-dimensional
(2D) materials5−8 has triggered tremendous interest
in the field of nanoscience and technology. The promising potential
applications of these materials are well documented in recent studies.9−17 Typically, graphene has an excellent electron mobility,18 which makes graphene a superior candidate in
transistor and other applications. These 2D materials have been used
to recognize various biomolecules,19,20 pollutants,21,22 and gas molecules23,24 to develop suitable sensing devices.
However, the usefulness of these materials is limited because of lack
of band gap in graphene,25 large band gap
in h-BN, and lower carrier mobility in TMDC,26 which calls for further development of alternative materials that
can be used in a variety of fields. Chemical doping,27 noncovalent interactions of various molecules,28 and structural engineering by cutting 2D sheets
into nanoribbons (NRs) are some of the possible ways to engineer the
band gap of graphene. However, the opening of the band gap significantly
reduces the conductivity. Hence, searching for novel 2D semiconducting
materials endowed with required electronic properties is utmost important
for multifunctional applications.

Şahin et al.29 proposed 22 materials
having honeycomb lattice that are composed of groups IV and III–V
elements. These materials are found to be minimum on the Born–Oppenheimer
surface. Among these proposed materials, few of them are experimentally
synthesized30,31 and their potential applications
have been well explored.32,33 However, some of the
materials are yet to be synthesized and their applications in various
fields have not been unraveled. In this context, boron arsenide (BAs)
sheet has been chosen from a list of materials that are yet to be
synthesized for the current investigation. There are specific reasons
for choosing BAs for the present study: (i) cubic boron arsenide has
been synthesized,34,35 and its properties have also
been determined (predicted) from experimental (theoretical) methods.36 It was found that cubic BAs have very high thermal
conductivity, which is comparable to that of diamond and graphite.36 (ii) In the family of III–V compounds,
BAs have the highest covalent character37 and are stable against chemical decomposition and dissolution.38 (iii) Another exciting feature is that the valence
bands of BAs can offset those of GaAs,39 which makes these materials as ideal alloying systems. These interesting
properties prompted us to explore further electronic, transport, optical,
and thermoelectric properties of BAs sheets.

In the present
study, an extensive analysis on the structure and
stability of 2D hexagonal BAs sheet has been carried out by employing
first principles density functional theory (DFT)-based periodic calculations.
The following important points have been investigated:(i) To unravel the effect
of application
of biaxial strain on the electronic properties of BAs sheet.

(ii) To understand the effect
of nanoconfinement
on the electronic properties of BAs sheet by designing appropriate
one-dimensional (1D) zigzag nanoribbon (ZNR) and armchair nanoribbon
(ANR).

(iii) To explore
the potential multifunctional
applications of this novel material by computing electronic, transport,
optical, thermoelectric, and thermodynamic properties.



Results and Discussion
Geometrical Properties
The stable
structure of a honeycomb
lattice consisting of two atoms B and As is shown in Figure 1. This material belongs to P6̅M2(D3H1) symmetry with hexagonal space group (space group no. 187). The
optimized lattice parameters of BAs are a = b = 3.39 Å with B–As bond length of 1.95 Å
and bond angle of 120°. These values are in good agreement with
the previously reported values.40,41

a planar boron arsenide sheet.

To elucidate the nature of chemical bonding in BAs sheet,
electron
localization function (ELF)42 was calculated
and the contour map sliced perpendicular to the (001) direction is
shown in Figure 2.
ELF is a measure of relative electron localization in the structure,
where the value 1 (red) denotes the fully localized electrons, 0 (blue)
indicates typically low electron density area, and 0.5 implies the
probability of free electron gas. It can be clearly seen from Figure 2 that high localization
of electron can be observed in the middle of the B–As bond,
reflecting the role of strong covalent bond in the stabilization of
this material.

(001) direction.

It is well known that
the cohesive energy determines the stability
of the material. The cohesive energy of BAs sheet has been calculated
using the following equation  where ECoh is
the cohesive energy (per atom), EBAs is
the total energy of the unit cell, EB and EAs are the the energy of the isolated elements,
and nB and nAs are the number of atoms in the unit cell. The calculated cohesive
energy is found to be −4.29 eV/atom, which implies the stability
of the system. The calculated ECoh is
also in close agreement with previously reported values.41 The cohesive energy of arsenene, AsP, AsSb,
AsBi, and AsN are −2.953, −3.153, −2.771, −2.642,
and −3.443 eV/atoms, respectively.43,44 It can be noticed that the calculated cohesive energy is comparatively
higher than that of the arsenene sheet and its alloys. Some of the
cohesive energies of other theoretically predicted 2D materials, such
as CdS (−2.65 eV/atom),45 GeS (3.01
eV/atom),46 GeSe (2.77 eV/atom),46 SnS (2.06 eV/atom),46 and Cu2As (2.98 eV/atom),47 have been reported. Ding et al.48 concluded
that SiX and XSi3 (X = B, C, N, Al, and P) can possibly
be synthesized by chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy
methods on the basis of cohesive energy calculations. On the basis
of similar arguments, BAs sheet is also an experimentally realizable
material.

Dynamic Stability
In general, the phonon calculation
is an appropriate approach to investigate the dynamical stability
of materials. The calculated phonon dispersion curve and phonon density
of states (PDOS) of BAs sheet are are displayed in Figure 3a,b. It can be seen from Figure 3a, there is no imaginary
mode in the phonon dispersion indicating the inherent dynamical stability
of the system and confirming that BAs sheet is indeed a local minimum.
Notably, the highest frequency of the BAs monolayer is 834 cm–1, which is higher than that of arsenene allotropes,
silicene (580 cm–1),49 tetrasilicene (466 cm–1),50 hexasilicene (560 cm–1),49 MoS2 monolayer (473 cm–1),51 and phosphorene (∼450 cm–1)52 materials, which indicates the higher
strength of B–As bond.

states of BAs.

Thermal Stability
The thermal stability of BAs sheet
is assessed by performing ab initio Born–Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics (BOMD) simulations in which the forces are calculated from
the ground-state electronic configuration at each molecular dynamics
step. The CASTEP53 package was used as
implemented in Material studio. The total simulation time of 5 ps
with a time step of 1 fs in NVT ensemble was performed at 300 K. It
is noted from Figure 4a that the material is stable at room temperature with negligible
deviation from the planarity. The total energy profile as a function
of time is shown in Figure 4b. The mechanical stability of the BAs sheet has been assessed
by calculating the elastic constant using thermo_pw module, as implemented
in Quantum ESPRESSO.54 The computed elastic
constants fulfill the Born criteria55 of
stability for hexagonal structures, i.e., C11 > 0 and C11 – C12 > 0 and C66 > 0,
which
ensures the mechanical stability of the system. The calculated values
of C11, C12, and C66 are 80.65, 19.71, and 29.09
GPa, respectively, and provide valuable information on the strong
bonding.

total energy as a function of time.

Therefore, our findings from cohesive energy calculations,
phonon
dispersion, and BOMD simulations highlight that the BAs sheet is stable
and there is a high possibility that this can be experimentally realizable.

Electronic Properties
The calculated band structure
of BAs sheet is presented in Figure 5. It can be observed from Figure 5 that it is a direct band gap semiconductor,
with a band gap of 0.76 eV. Both valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction
band minimum (CBM) are located at the K point. The
contributions of individual orbitals of a BAs sheet can be observed
from PDOS. The VBM are mainly contributed by p orbitals of arsenene,
and CBM are contributed by p orbitals of boron. This appreciable band
gap would facilitate the application of BAs sheet in nanoelectronics,
as observed in other similar 2D materials. We have also calculated
the Lowdin charges, and it is noted that 0.49e is
transferred from arsenene to boron atom.

and PDOS of BAs sheet.

Application of strain on materials is one of the effective
ways
to engineer the electronic properties of 2D materials. The effect
of biaxial strain on the electronic properties of a BAs sheet (schematic
representation as shown in Figure 6a) has been studied by applying strain (ε) from
2 to 14%. During the application of strain, the prediction of stability
of material is primarily important. Hence, the phonon dispersion calculations
have been performed to unravel the stability of this material for
various values of applied strain. The predicted phonon dispersion
results are presented in Figure 6b,c. It can be noticed from phonon dispersion and associated
phonon density of states in Figure 6b,c that there are no imaginary vibrational modes,
implying BAs sheets possesses high mechanical strength and are dynamically
stable under strained conditions up to ε = 14%. As observed
from Figure 6b,c, frequencies
of all phonon modes soften considerably under strain due to stretching
of the bonds.56 The calculated band structure
of BAs sheet under various biaxial strains is depicted in Figure 7. This material behaves
as a direct band gap semiconductor for up to 8% of strain, and the
increase in the band gap is marginal (Supporting Information, SI (Figure S1)). The change in the band gap takes
place from direct to indirect band gap by the employment of 10% strain,
and the band gap value is found to decrease. The material becomes
metallic by the application of biaxial strain of 14%. The conduction
band has a tendency to approach the Fermi level by the application
of biaxial strain (say 10% in BAs sheet). Thus, the inherent direct
band gap semiconducting nature of BAs changes to indirect band gap
material by the application of 10% strain and it becomes metallic
upon employment of 14% biaxial strain.

of BAs with biaxial strain, (b) calculated
phonon dispersion curve, and (c) phonon density of states of a BAs
sheet with various values of applied biaxial strain.

Figure 7 Strain-induced electronic band structure of a BAs sheet
with different
biaxial strains.

We have also modeled
the 1D nanoribbons (NRs) by cleaving the BAs
sheet along (110) and (100) directions to get armchair nanoribbon
(ANR) and zigzag nanoribbons (ZNRs) (SI Figure S2), respectively. The edges of the nanoribbons are passivated
by hydrogen atoms to saturate B and As atoms. To investigate the effect
of nanoconfinement on the electronic structure of nanoribbons, we
have increased the width (N) of the ribbons from N = 1 to 7. The computed band structures are shown in SI Figure S2. Both zigzag and armchair nanoribbons
elicit a semiconducting character, and with increase in the width,
the band gap of the nanoribbons decreases. When compared to the ZNR,
the band gap of ANR is high (up to N = 3). However, N = 4 onward the band gaps of the both systems are almost
equal.

Transport Properties
We have used nonequilibrium Green’s
function technique combined with DFT approach, as implemented in TranSIESTA57 package to study the transport characteristics
of BAs nanoribbon. A two-probe model was used, in which semi-infinite
left and right electrodes were connected with the scattering region,
as shown in Figure 8. Both scattering and electrode regions are made with 11 ANR. The
scattering regions contain four primitive unit cells with the length
of 23.52 Å. To provide a better understanding of the transport
phenomena, the band structure of the electrode/scattering of their
primitive unit cell is displayed in Figure 9a. It is observed from Figure 9a that, it is a direct band gap semiconductor
with the band gap value of 0.84 eV. The calculated zero bias transmission
spectra is shown in Figure 9b, which is consistent with the computed band structure. We
have calculated the current (I) as a function of
applied bias voltage (V), which is represented in Figure 9c. The calculated I–V curve clearly supports the computed
band structure and transmission spectra. As observed from Figure 9c, the device has
a threshold voltage (Vth) of 0.8 V, below
which the current is close to zero and above which the current tends
to increase. Further increasing V (say above 0.8
V), the corresponding output current increases. The effect of increase
in the current can be comprehensively understood from the calculated
transmission spectra with various values of V, as
given in Figure 10. The following important observations emerge from the close analysis
of the variation of current with bias voltage: (i) the BAs nanoribbon
has a conductance gap of 0.8 V at zero bias voltage. (ii) Upon increasing
the bias voltage above the threshold value, the valence band of the
left electrode matches the energy of the conduction band of the right
electrode. Hence, tunneling of electrons takes place through the valence
band of the left electrode to conduction band of the right electrode.
(iii) Thus, the conductance band gap decreases with the increase in
the bias voltage and leads to increase in the associated current.
Further, we have calculated the I–V characteristics to understand the effect of size and length
of the scattering region of the nanoribbons and results are depicted
in SI Figures S4 and S5.

nanoribbon. The periodic direction is Z.

voltages.

Optical Properties
The direct band gap nature of this
material has multifunctional applications in the field of optical
devices due to the formation of exciton that requires less energy.
From an experimental point of view, the optical properties are determined
by the luminescence spectrum, absorption coefficient, reflection and
refraction index, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. All of these
measurable optical properties can be evaluated by the calculation
of dielectric functions. The calculated imaginary part (ε2) of the dielectric function with the electric field parallel
(E || c) and perpendicular (E ⊥ c) to the basal plane of a BAs
sheet is presented in Figure 11a. The anisotropic behavior in parallel and perpendicular
polarizations of the electric field can be seen from Figure 11a. There are two strong optical
absorption regions in the range 0.7–5.2 and 5.3–10 eV.
These values cover near-IR, visible, and UV regions of the electromagnetic
spectrum. The first exciton peak of BAs corresponding to E ⊥ c is found to be at 0.7 eV. The second
exciton peak occurs at 2.1 eV, and the third exciton peak appears
at 5.5 eV. If the electric field polarization is parallel to the c direction, there is no major peak corresponding to the
imaginary part of the dielectric function up to 8.5 eV, indicating
negligible optical absorption in this region. Hence, the intensity
of ε2 in perpendicular (E ⊥ c) polarization is larger than that in parallel (E || c) polarization. Thus, it is evident
from the optical properties of a BAs sheet that it behaves as an anisotropic
material. The calculated absorption coefficient of a BAs sheet is
shown in Figure 11b. The strong absorption appears in the UV range, and an intense
peak appears at 6.4 eV for E ⊥ c. For parallel polarization, the absorption coefficient of BAs sheet
is almost negligible in the visible region (completely opaque to the
visible region) and it has a strong absorption characteristic for
a UV region with many peaks. These results are in concomitance with
the calculated ε2 values. We are particularly interested
in focusing on the absorption coefficients in the visible ranges for
applications in optical devices. It is observed from Figure 11c that a relatively strong
absorption peak with a value of 2.6 eV in the visible-light range
is observed. Thus, it can be clearly noticed that this material can
also absorb low-energy light quite effectively, indicating BAs sheets
can be employed as a potential material for the development of short-wavelength
optoelectronic devices for energy conversion and UV-light protection.

perpendicular electric fields, (b) absorption coefficient, and (c)

Thermoelectric Properties
The electronic transport
coefficients of BAs sheet with different temperatures have been calculated
using the semiclassical Boltzmann theory and constant time approximation.
The rigid band model was employed to calculate the thermoelectric
coefficients for different chemical potential values. Figure 12 shows the variation of thermoelectric
properties like the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical
conductivity (σ), electronic thermal conductivity (ke), and power factor of BAs sheet, with chemical potential
(μ) at different temperatures (300, 500, and 700 K). The positive
value of chemical potential (μ) represents n-type doping, and
negative value indicates p-type doping. The Seebeck coefficient as
a function of chemical potential at different temperatures is depicted
in Figure 12a. As
observed from the figure, the maximum values of the Seebeck coefficient
are obtained for the range −0.5–0.5 eV of chemical potential.
Beyond this range the curves tends to 0. The highest value of the
Seebeck coefficient (−1242.19 μV/K) is obtained at 300
K. The negative value shows that the electrons diffuse from the hot
end to the cold end, thereby enhancing concentration of electrons
in the cold end with reference to the hot end.58,59 The Seebeck coefficient values decrease with increase in the temperature,
due to the augmentation of electron and hole conductivities by enhancement
of thermal energy.60 The calculated Seebeck
coefficient value is higher than that of MoSe2,61 WSe2,61 graphydiyne,62 phosphorene,63 transition-metal silicides,64 and other conventional thermoelectric materials,65 which implies that BAs sheets can be favorably
employed as a thermoelectric material. Overall, this material is an
n-type semiconductor combined with good thermoelectric performance. Figure 12b shows the variation
of electrical conductivity with chemical potential at different temperatures.
The value of electrical conductivity is 0 in the range −0.5–0.5
eV. However, beyond this range, the value of electrical conductivity
increases with chemical potential. Further, the changes in the electrical
conductivity with chemical potential are similar at different temperatures.
The value of electrical conductivity is appreciably high for positive
chemical potentials when compared with negative values, implying that
n-type carrier is more than p-type composition.

Figure 12 Calculated (a) Seebeck
coefficient, (b) electrical conductivity,
(c) electronic thermal conductivity, and (d) power factor with different
chemical potentials of a BAs sheet.

Figure 12c depicts
the variation of electronic thermal conductivity with μ at various
temperatures. These plots show that the enhancement of electronic
thermal conductivity takes place with increase in the chemical potential
and temperature. It is considerably higher for positive chemical potential
with reference to the negative chemical potential, suggesting that
enhancement in carrier concentration increases the mobility, which
in turn amplifies the electronic thermal conductivity.

The power
factor is a key parameter that influences the thermoelectric
performance of the material. The changes in the power factor with
chemical potential at various temperatures are depicted in Figure 12d. The maximum
value of the power factor is obtained as 16.46 × 1011 W/(m s K2) for n-type doping at 700 K. Hence, the calculated
Seebeck coefficient and power factor are higher than those of some
of the available conventional thermoelectric materials and thus this
new material BAs is a promising candidate in the field of thermoelectricity.

Thermodynamic Properties
We have calculated thermodynamic
properties such as free energy, entropy, and constant volume heat
capacity (Cv) of BAs sheets using the
phonon frequency. Figure 13 elicits the changes in the free energy, entropy, and Cv as a function of temperature. It can be noticed
from the figure that the heat capacity of BAs is 22.8 J/(K mol) at
300 K. The decrease in free energy with increase in temperature can
also be observed. As expected, entropy increases with increase in
temperature. The entropy and specific heat values are zero at 0 K,
which is in complete agreement with the third law of thermodynamics.

capacity of BAs sheet.

Conclusions
In summary, the first-principle calculations
provided valuable
insight into electronic, transport, optical, thermoelectric, and thermodynamic
properties of BAs sheets. The stability of a two-dimensional sheet
is assessed by energetics, phonon distribution, and molecular dynamics
simulations. The electronic structure calculations reveal that BAs
is a direct band gap semiconductor and the band gap can be tuned by
the application of external biaxial strain. The application of biaxial
strain (from ε = 0 to 8%) leads to increase in the band gap,
and after 8%, the splitting of the conduction band takes place. At
a biaxial strain of 10%, the transition from a direct semiconductor
nature to indirect band gap nature occurs. With further increase of
biaxial strain, the band gap decreases and the material becomes metallic
at ε = 14%. Furthermore, both armchair and zigzag nanoribbons
of BAs sheets have been designed and their electronic properties have
been calculated. Results reveal that both nanoribbons are semiconductor
and the band gap values are dependent on the width of the ribbon.
The calculated transmission spectra and I–V characteristics highlight that the value of the output
current increases with increase in the input bias voltage. To explore
the application of this material in the field of optoelectronics,
the dielectric function and absorption coefficients have been predicted.
Considerable optical anisotropy is observed for parallel and perpendicular
polarizations of the electric field, and the material shows strong
absorption in the UV and visible regions. The calculated Seebeck coefficient
and power factor values elicit the favorable application of BAs sheet
in the field of thermoelectric applications. The calculated thermodynamic
results highlight that the entropy and constant volume specific heat
capacity values increase and free-energy values decrease with increase
in the temperature. The comprehensive study of electronic, optical,
transport, thermoelectric, and thermodynamic properties of BAs sheets
presented in this work is expected to form a solid foundation for
the various applications of this 2D material.

Computational Method
The geometrical, electronic, and phonon calculations of BAs sheets
were carried out using density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations
within projected augmented wave and a plane wave basis, as implemented
in Quantum ESPRESSO package.54 The generalized
gradient approximation as suggested by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof66 was employed. The plane waves were expanded
with a kinetic energy cutoff of 45 Ry. Convergence thresholds of 10–6 Ry and 0.002 Ry/bohr were used for energy and forces,
respectively. Periodic boundary conditions were used throughout the
study. A vacuum spacing of 12 Å was introduced along a nonperiodic
direction to minimize the spurious interactions between periodic supercell
images. Monkhorst–Pack67k-point meshes of 8 × 8 × 1 and 16 × 16 ×
1 were used for geometrical and electronic structure calculations.
The optical and transport properties were calculated using Siesta
package.68 The thermoelectric properties
were calculated using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory
and the rigid band approach, as implemented in the BoltzTraP code.69 The constant scattering time approximation was
used, which accurately describes the thermoelectric properties of
many materials.70,71
