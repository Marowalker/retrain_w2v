A Na-smectite clay mineral (Na-Mt)
was exchanged with two concentrations
of benzyldimethyltetradecyl ammonium chloride cationic surfactant
up to one time the cation exchange capacity. Nonionic organoclay was
prepared with polyoxyethylene (20) oleyl ether (Brij-O20) nonionic
surfactant at one concentration. The resulting organoclays displayed
lateral layer organization of the surfactants within their interlayer
space.. The adsorption properties of these organoclays and the starting
raw clay mineral were evaluated for three extensively used antibiotic
pharmaceutical products: the amoxicillin (AMX), the sulfamethoxazole
(SMX), and the trimethoprim (TRI), recognized as recalcitrant compounds
to conventional water treatments and to display a complex behavior
for different pH and temperature experimental conditions. Besides
showing short half-life time with possible degradation by UV radiation,
these antibiotics associated with mineral phases cause serious environmental
issues of which the toxic effect can be exacerbated in the presence
of other chemical compounds. From the set of data obtained by complementary
techniques: UV and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction,
it appears that the nonionic organoclay shows its versatility for
the adsorption of individual molecules as well as a pool of antibiotics.
The mixing of the three antibiotics showing different electric charged
species (cations, anions, and zwitterions) mimics the natural context
drives to a deep modification of the adsorption behavior onto the
different materials that can act as possible carrier mineral phases
in aquatic environment. These competition effects can be measured
through the significant decrease of the KF Freundlich constants for AMX in the presence of other molecules
(or electrolytes), whereas TRI and SMX, by their possible association,
create a synergistic effect that favors their adsorption on the whole
layered materials.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
1928, the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming opened
the way to antibiotics treatment in modern pharmacopoeia and it took
about 15 years in the end of the Second World War, for their prescription
being actually endorsed. If their therapeutic efficiency does not
need to be demonstrated, their overuse is increasingly criticized
for several reasons: (i) the fate of antibiotics or their metabolites
associated with mineral phases in aquatic environments leading to
toxic effects on several ecosystems;1−5 (ii) an insidious food contamination with an accumulation of antibiotics
or pool of bioactive molecules in human biological tissues leading
to a potential reduction in their therapeutic efficiency;4 and (iii) the threat of an antibiotics resistance
with the emergence of superbacteria without any unavailable current
solution interpellating both the scientific community and the public
authorities. Amoxicillin (AMX), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and trimethoprim
(TRI), with their high consumption and versatility to treat multiple
pathologies, are frequently found at concentrations up to microgram
per liter in natural and wastewaters (typically in the range of 0.6–2
μg L–1) and even in soils, leading to serious
environmental issues.1−3,5−18

The presence of pharmaceuticals (PhACs) even at low concentration
is now recognized to have significant toxic actions on numerous ecosystems
with the alteration of both the activity and boldness of several fishes.3−20 Moreover, because fish tissues show high concentration in both organic
micropollutants and trace elements, they drive to the contamination
of the whole trophic chain. Conversely, some benthic invertebrate
communities can be eradicated with exposure to contaminated sediments
or/and PhAC. Thus, understanding of both the dynamics of PhACs and
their association with mineral phases in the environment is of first
importance to apprehend their pollution in water resources and toxic
actions on various ecosystems. Although the antibiotics in this study
(at least the mobilized fraction) display a moderate short half-life
time (up to couple hours), their presence in aquatic environments,
even as short as possible, represent a possible pathway for bacterial
anti-bioresistance because of their fast life cycle (on average, a
generation is obtained for each 20 min).

In aquatic environments,
organic compounds including pollutants
are frequently associated or in close interaction with mineral phases
in suspension, leading to a possible preservation and thus a persistence
in aquatic environment.1,3,7,13,19−21 Among the mineral phases found in effluents, clay minerals or/and
their organoclay derivatives (assimilated or model humic clay complexes)
represent a large fraction which were recognized to play a role in
the preservation of the organic matter. These layered materials show
a large specific surface area, ion-exchange capacities, and outstanding
hydration properties, leading to an exfoliation of the nanosheets
that can even self-assemble in liquid crystalline phases.22−26 Their association as holding or carrier mineral phases with pharmaceuticals
and other pollutants represents a possible vector of diffusion acting
as a potential “time bomb” of pollution, with an easy
release or remobilization of the pollutants after a change of the
environmental conditions (pH, temperature, or electrolytes) along
effluents.

Thus, understanding of the adsorption mechanisms
or the main driving
force leading to adsorption, as well as the competition of a pool
of antibiotics onto clay mineral and its organoclay derivatives, is
of first importance to figure out the mobility and fate of organic
pollutants in the environment. This study also tackles the possible
uses of organoclays as novel adsorbents used in water treatments.
Indeed, organoclays, prepared through the chemical modification of
a clay mineral surface with both cationic and nonionic surfactants,
were suggested as realistic materials in water remediation strategies
with regards to their singular adsorption properties for several pollutants.7,9,11,14,17,20,21,23,24,27 Nevertheless, the final properties
of organoclays mainly depend on both the nature of the surfactant
and its density or arrangement, where nonionic organoclays (i.e.,
prepared with nonionic surfactants) appear as a polyvalent material
for numerous compounds and recently pharmaceuticals.

In that
frame research work, this study focuses on the adsorption
of three antibiotics: the AMX, the SMX, and TRI, showing different
functional groups and electric charge onto four adsorbent materials:
a starting reference montmorillonite and three organoclays as mimic
humic–clay complexes. The organoclays were prepared with cationic:
the benzyldimethyltetradecyl ammonium (BDTA) and nonionic: the polyoxyethylene
(20) oleyl ether (Brij-O20) surfactants at two different molecular
arrangements and densities/loadings, allowing us to modulate both
the hydrophocity/hydrophilicity ratio and their ion-exchange capacity.
Through the use of a set of complementary techniques [UV spectroscopy,
high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry
(HPLC/MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray
diffraction (XRD)], this study gives important insights into the understanding
of the interaction mechanisms controlling the adsorption of a pool
of antibiotics in different experimental conditions for a proper simulation
of the fate of these antibiotics associated with mineral phases/humic
clay complexes in a natural context.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
Wyoming sodium montmorillonite
(Mt), obtained from the Source Clay Minerals Repository, University
of Missouri (Columbia, MO), was used in this study as a starting material.
The structural formula can be expressed as: (Ca0.12Na0.32K0.05)[Al3.01Fe(III)0.41Mn0.01Mg0.54Ti0.02]-[Si7,98Al0.02]O20(OH)4. Mt was fractioned
to <2 μm by gravity sedimentation, purified, and sodium (Na+) exchanged. This Mt clay mineral shows a cation exchange
capacity (CEC) of 76.4 mequiv per 100 g clay.

BDTA cationic
and polyoxyethylene (20) oleyl ether (Brij-O20) nonionic surfactants
(Figure 1) were supplied
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical. Aqueous solutions of surfactants with
Millipore deionized water (25 mL) were prepared at room temperature
(25 °C) at concentrations of 0.4 and 1 time the CEC of Mt clay
for BDTA and at a concentration of about 1.13 × 10–3 mol L–1 for Brij-O20. Then, these surfactant solutions
were mixed to Mt aqueous dispersions (25 mL with 100 mg of Mt clay)
before being stirred at 300 rpm for 24 h. At the end of this procedure,
the solutions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatants
were removed and the solid fractions (organoclays) were recovered.
The resulting organoclays were dried at 100 °C for 24 h before
analysis without altering the confined organic compounds by thermal
analyses.

as chemical modifiers for the preparation of the organoclays.

2.2 Experimental
Techniques
The concentration
of the three antibiotics before and after being in contact with the
layered adsorbents: raw clay mineral and organoclays was obtained
by UV–visible analysis using an Evolution 220 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific). FTIR measurements in the range 650–4000
cm–1 were recorded using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FT
spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector
and a Nicolet Continuum microscope. The powder samples were spread
over a NaCl window of the microscope. The analyzed sample area was
a square of side 100 μm chosen under the microscope 15×
Infinity Reflechromat objective. The analyses were performed in transmission
mode, and each spectrum corresponded to the average of 256 scans was
collected at 2 cm–1 resolution. The d001 spacing’s of the layered materials before and
after being in contact with the antibiotics were determined by the
first 00l reflection from the X-ray patterns which
were recorded in a conventional θ–θ Bragg–Brentano
configuration by using a Thermo Electron ARLX’TRA diffractometer
equipped with a Cu anode (Cu Kα = 1.5418 Å) coupled with
a Si(Li) solid detector. The diffractograms on dry samples (100 °C
for 24 h) were performed between 1° and 24° (2θ) with
angular and time steps of 0.04° and 10 s, respectively.

Chromatographic separation was achieved with an Ultimate 3000 RSLC
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., CA, USA) liquid chromatography system
equipped with a binary pump and a Nucleodur C18 Gravity column (150
mm × 2 mm; 1.8 μm, Macherey-Nagel) supplemented by a guard
column. Separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min–1, and the temperature was maintained at 30 °C.
Two solvents were used as the mobile phase: ultrapure water (solvent
A) and ACN (solvent B) both acidified with 0.1% of formic acid. The
elution gradient was a transition from 95% to 5% of A in 16.2 min
followed by 3.3 min of 100% of B and then a return to the initial
conditions (95% of A) during 10 min for a total analysis time of 29
min. The chromatography system was coupled to a TSQ Endura triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization
interface (Thermo Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Quantification
was performed in UHPLC/MRM MS with an electrospray ionization source
operating in a positive mode, with an electrospray voltage of 3600
V, a vaporizer temperature of 450 °C, an ion transfer temperature
of 325 °C, sheath gas of 50 Arb, auxiliary gas of 20 Arb, and
sweep gas of 1 Arb.

2.3 Adsorption of PPs
AMX (6-(p-hydroxy-α-aminophenylacetamido)penicillanic
acid),
SMX (4-amino-N-(5-methyl-3-isoxazolyl))benzenesulfonamide),
and TRI (5-[(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl) methyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine),
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical and assumed to have a purity
>98%, were used in batch adsorption experiments onto raw clay mineral
and its organoclay derivatives using at least 10 initial aqueous solutions
ranging from 10 mg L–1 to 4 g L–1. AMX displays a log P (log Kow) of about 0.87 and 2 pKa of
3.23 and 7.43, whereas SMX shows a pKa couple of 6.16 and 1.97 (respectively, for the strongest acidic
and basic forms) that has a log P of 0.89 and a water
solubility of 610 mg L–1 (at 37 °C). TRI shows
a log P of 1.28, and 2 pKa of 17.33 and 7.16 (respectively, for the strongest acidic and basic
forms) has a water solubility of 400 mg L–1 (at
25 °C). The solid-to-liquid ratio was kept constant, where 100
mg of sorbents was used for 50 mL of PP aqueous solutions in centrifuge
tubes, and the pH was adjusted by HCl acidic and NaOH basic solutions
at a pH of 6.5 close to that of effluents. Samples were shaken on
a rotary shaker at 50 rpm during 24 h in order to reach the equilibrium
final concentrations and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 25 min. Both
supernatants and sorbents after contact with the PPs were removed
and analyzed through UV–visible spectroscopy and for a pool
of pharmaceuticals through HPLC-MS. The amount of adsorbed PPs was
calculated by the difference between the initial and equilibrium final
concentrations that allowed us to determine the equilibrium adsorption
isotherms. Prior XRD and FTIR characterizations, the entire resulting
organoclays and Mt after adsorption of the antibiotics were dried
at 100 °C for 48 h.

2.4 Fitting Procedure
The resulting adsorption
isotherms of the antibiotics onto organoclays and Mt were fit using
the Langmuir model expressed as 1  where qe is the
equilibrium pharmaceutical amount adsorbed on sorbents (mol g–1), Ce is the equilibrium
pharmaceutical concentration in the resulting solution (mol L–1), qmax is the maximum
adsorption capacity of the sorbents or the carrier organo-mineral
phases (mol g–1), and KL is the Langmuir adsorption constant (L mol–1)
which is related to the free energy (ΔG°)
of adsorption by the relation (2) 2  

Because the adsorption of the surfactant
contributes to a change of the chemical nature of the surface and
heterogeneity in the distribution of the adsorption sites, a Freundlich
model isotherm equation was used. The Freundlich isotherm is an empirical
equation to describe heterogeneous systems of which the linear form
is 3  where KF (L g–1) and n are the Freundlich adsorption
isotherm constants, being indicative of the extent of the adsorption
and the degree of nonlinearity between the solute concentration and
adsorption, respectively.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Speciation of the Antibiotics
The
selected antibiotics in this study show complex and various functional
groups as their therapeutic actions. Indeed, AMX or the SMX exhibits
two pKa couples leading to cationic–zwitterionic–anionic
behavior (along the pH range 0–14) in contrast to the TRI,
showing a speciation diagram with only cationic and zwitterionic species
(Figure 2).7,28 At a pH close to that of effluents (pH at about 6.5 represented
as a dashed line in Figure 2), the antibiotics show different electric charges: AMX is
mainly zwitterionic (with a speciation frequency at about 90%) and
anionic (10%). SMX also displays a similar zwitterionic–anionic
behavior with a ratio of 30/70%, whereas TRI principally is mainly
a cation (80%) but shows some zwitterionic species (20%) (Figure 2). With approximately
the same molecular size and similar hydrophobicity with a log P spreading out from 0.75 to 1.28, a change of pH leading
to anionic species for AMX for instance would have consisted to get
similar observations for SMX or other anionic species about the interactional
mechanisms responsible for the formation of complexes with mineral
phases. This approach offers the possibility to study the differences
in the efficiency of the adsorption without any changes of the experimental
conditions (constant pH and temperature), except the substitution
of a chemical. Thus, it justifies a choice to work at only one pH,
whereas a complete and deep study in understanding the affinity, on
the whole pH range, of these chemicals onto Na-Mt and the organoclay
derivatives, being potential sorbent materials or holding mineral
phases in natural environment is needed.

Figure 2 Speciation of the three
antibiotics used in this study: AMX, SMX,
and TRI, mainly zwitterionic, anionic, and cationic at a pH = 6.5,
respectively.

Thus, the pharmaceuticals
display for a similar hydrophobicity
(log P comprised between 0.75 and 1.28) and different
electric charges involving interaction mechanisms such as electrotactic
interaction (cation exchange or association between organic anions
and cationic organoclay), ion–dipole (with some moieties of
the pharmaceuticals and the inorganic cations of the layered materials),
and van der Waals interactions (hydrophobic moieties of the antibiotics
with those of the environment generated by the intercalated surfactant)
as main driving forces for the adsorption onto the layered materials.

3.2 Organoclay Characteristics
On the
basis of both XRD with in particular a shift at low angle value of
the 00l reflection probing the proper intercalation
of the surfactants and FTIR data focusing on the CH2 stretching
vibration frequencies of the alkyl chains stressing out the gauche
conformation of the molecules (Figures SI-1 and SI-2), the surfactant arrangements can be drawn and summarized
as follows in Figure 3: a lateral monolayer (BDTA0.4-Mt) and bilayers (BDTA-Mt
and Brij0.4-Mt) .20−24 This offers a large range of materials with versatile and complementary
properties: from CEC and hydrophilicity for untreated Na-Mt, dual
hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity for both BDTA0.4-Mt and Brij0.4-Mt, to hydrophobicity or organophilicity and an anion adsorption
ability for BDTA-Mt, allowing one to expect the adsorption of the
antibiotics showing a similar log P but different
electric behavior at a pH of 6.5 (Figure 2).

Figure 3 Schematic representation of the whole geo-sorbents
used in this
study: Na-Mt clay mineral, BDTA0.4-Mt (60% of the compensating
cations is preserved) showing a lateral monolayer arrangement, BDTA-Mt
(100% of the compensation cations is substituted to BDTA) with a lateral
bilayer organization, and Brij0.4-Mt, a nonionic organoclay
showing a dual hydrophilic-hydrophobic behavior (where the inorganic
cations are kept within the interlayer space). The sorbents used in
this study display singular adsorption properties: hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity,
cation/anion retention which will be highlighted with three antibiotics
of different chemical natures.

3.3 Individual Adsorption of the Antibiotics on
the Layered Materials
3.3.1 Adsorption of the AMX
As expected
and previously observed for numerous organoclay/organic product couples,
the equilibrium adsorption isotherms confirm the improvement of the
adsorption properties of both nonionic and cationic organoclays compared
to the raw clay mineral (Figure 2).9,17,20,21,24 The line shapes
of the adsorption isotherms at the equilibrium for the four different
layered materials attest the ambivalence of AMX (zwitterionic and
anionic forms according to its speciation diagram in Figure 2). The whole adsorption isotherms
display a similar evolution with a gradual growth of the adsorbed
amount as the equilibrium concentration is increased without the observation
of any steady state or plateau underlining the absence of any saturation
(Figure 4). Although
implying complex and diverse interactional mechanisms due to both
the ambivalence of AMX6,17,28,29 and the type of layered materials, the adsorption
isotherms allow one to precisely quantify the degree of affinity between
AMX and the four adsorbents, where the hydrophobicity appears to contribute
in the degree of adsorption. Thus, the BDTA-Mt organoclay seems to
be the most efficient material with a maximum adsorbed amount estimated
through a Langmuir fit of about 5.68 × 10–3 mol g–1, whereas Brij0.4-Mt shows a
value of about 4.44 × 10–3 mol g–1 and a maximum amount of 2.40 × 10–3 mol g–1 for BDTA0.4-Mt (Table 1). In contrast, Na-Mt adsorbs 9.29 ×
10–4 mol of AMX per gram, 1 order of magnitude lower
than the most efficient organoclays, but nevertheless represents an
important amount: above the CEC. Zwitterionic compounds such as AMX
have been recognized to be easily intercalated and adsorbed in raw
clay minerals through ion-dipole forces and cation exchanges. In the
case of the organoclays able to solicitate the inorganic cations for
a possible exchange (i.e., Brij0.4-Mt and BDTA0.4-Mt organoclays), as it was expected with their organophilic behavior
as well as the log P of AMX, additional interactional
mechanisms, which however are not reflected in the obtained fitting
parameters, implying probably molecular hydrophobic and π–π
interactions drive and enhance the maximum adsorbed amount of AMX
with an efficiency greater than 477 and about 610% for Brij0.4-Mt and BDTA-Mt, respectively, compared to that of Na-Mt. Because
of the ambivalence of AMX and the diversity of adsorption properties
of the layered materials used in this study, it is rather hard to
find a simple relation or correlation about the extent of the adsorption
with one of the features of AMX or characteristics of the sorbents.
Indeed, BDTA-Mt, the most hydrophobic material in this study, shows
an ability to adsorb anionic compounds including pharmaceuticals as
recent study stressed out.20,21 This is also observed
here where the anionic species of AMX are adsorbed and probably intercalated
with regards to the adsorbed amount not only through electrostatic
interactions but also through molecular interactions as explained
for two other organoclays: Brij0.4-Mt and BDTA0.4-Mt.

fits by using the Langmuir equation model.

With
regards to the extent of the adsorption, it was expected to
observe the intercalation of AMX within the interlayer space of the
layered materials. Nevertheless, only the X-ray diffractogram of Na-Mt
with AMX (Figure 5)
clearly shows a shift to a low angle with a 00l reflection
observed at about 6.2° (d001 ≅
14.9 Å) at a high-concentration regime (1–1.7 g L–1) confirming its proper intercalation. Thus, AMX enlarges
the interlayer space of Na-Mt at a value of about 5.5 Å, which
is however not sufficient to ensure, besides the large adsorbed amount
exceeding the maximum value that AMX may occupy the external surface
of the layered materials, an increase of the galleries height of the
whole organoclays. Thus, although the diffractograms of the whole
organoclays after being in contact with AMX do not show any structural
changes (i.e., no shift to the low angle of the 00l reflection was observed as shown in Figure 5), the adsorption of AMX leads to a probable
intercalation within the interlayer space where numerous available
free spots provided by the hydrocarbon chains of surfactants facilitate
the adsorption.

Brij0.4-Mt, and BDTA-Mt without and with amoxicillin at
a concentration
of 1 g L–1.

The complexity and richness of the interactional mechanisms
between
AMX and the different layered materials can be highlighted in FTIR
spectra of the layered materials before and after the adsorption (Figure 6). Additional vibrational
modes attributed to AMX can be observed with some of them shifted
in frequency compared to the bulk ones and are superimposed to those
relative of the layered materials (Figure SI-2), with however some differences. Indeed, interestingly, CO2– stretching bands at about 1800 cm–1 vanish for Na-Mt where AMX adsorption can be noticed through the
NH deformation vibration modes identified at 1500–1550 cm–1.30 The absence of the
CO2– stretching bands likely indicates
that these moieties contribute to the adsorption of AMX through ion–dipole
interaction or are blocked because of the confinement effect in such
2D geometry within the interlayer space of the layered materials.
Similar scenario occurs for the nonionic organoclay, where moreover
to NH stretching vibration at 1520 cm–1, another
band at 1700 cm–1 related to both similar NH deformation
(amine) and CO stretching (ketone) bands confirms the proper adsorption
of AMX and may emphasize the versatility of the moieties involved
in the adsorption of the pharmaceutical. In the same way, cationic
organoclays exhibit CO2– stretching bands
at about 1800 cm–1, whereas those related to the
NH and CH3 bands of AMX are hidden. Besides large adsorbed
amount, the incorporation of AMX is not sufficient to express a bulk-like
signature in the FTIR spectra. This indicates that the adsorption
of AMX leads to a partial covering of the surface on well-localized
specific adsorption sites of the holding phase without the formation
of any bulk-like aggregates. Here, the adsorption of AMX involves
multiple interaction mechanisms soliciting different moieties of the
pharmaceutical and adsorption sites of the holding phases. Those in
close interaction with the surface of the layered materials may be
drastically affected showing possible broadening and frequency shift
of their characteristics bands due to confinement effects and could
be even suppressed or hidden due to their close interaction with a
clay surface. Thus, FTIR data give important insights into the role
of the functional groups leading to the AMX adsorption, where it appears
that NH moieties (i.e., the zwitterionic form of AMX may be privileged
in the adsorption) contribute to the intercalation within the interlayer
of Na-Mt and probably in BDTA0.4-Mt and Brij0.4-Mt (identified with the band and shoulder at 1750 cm–1), whereas CH3 stretching bands are not affected. In the
case of BDTA-Mt, the excess of positive charge enhances the adsorption
of anionic species of AMX probed by the preservation of CO2– stretching bands that may interact with the organic
cations (BDTA+) in addition to possible hydrophobic interaction
between the alkyl chains and the organophilic core of AMX.

bands) of the layered materials: Na-Mt, BDTA0.4-Mt, BDTA-Mt,
and Brij0.4-Mt before and after being in
contact with AMX at a concentration of 1.7 g L–1.

In addition to give important
information in the adsorption processes,
this quantitative technique (in the transmission mode) allows one
to appreciate the evolution of both surfactants and adsorbed AMX following
the adsorption because the intensity of the absorption bands of these
compounds is proportional to their density (Figure 7).20−24 Indeed, the spectral feedbacks of both the CO2–(case of BDTA-Mt) and NH (case of Na-Mt and Brij0.4-Mt)
stretching bands follow the starting AMX concentration. The evolution
of their integrated intensity (CO2– and
NH stretching bands) through a deconvolution process similar to that
explained previously shows the same trends as the equilibrium adsorption
(Figure 8). However,
the line shape differs from a hyperbola which is somehow quite normal
and understandable with the use of the starting concentration as x axis. The deconvolution of the CH2 stretching
bands stresses out the stability of the organization of both surfactants,
whereas the adsorption of AMX within the interlayer space as both
FTIR and XRD analyses pointed out.

3.3.2 Adsorption of the SMX
SMX which
displays a half-life time of about 10 h is recognized to not react
with soil surfaces including clay minerals while showing a fast mobility
in the environment and thus leading to an easy diffusion of its pollution.8,16 The probable reasons explaining the absence of any reactions or
association with the soil mineral phases may be related to the low
pH value of soils and the hydrophobic character of the pharmaceutical
which is now classified as a recalcitrant compound to conventional
water treatment.8,16 The adsorption isotherms at the
equilibrium of SMX follow trends similar to those of AMX onto the
four holding phases with a gradual growth of the adsorbed amount as
the concentration is increased without reaching any plateau. However,
the list of the sorbents differs with the permutation of Brij0.4-Mt to BDTA0.4-Mt with regards to their affinity
to SMX which is probably linked to the change of ratio between zwitterionic
and anionic species. As expected, at a pH of about 6.5 for which 67%
SMX species are in an anionic form, the adsorption of this pharmaceutical
onto untreated Na-Mt is considerably limited and principally involves
the zwitterionic form (Figure 9). This leads to a maximum adsorbed amount, estimated through
a Langmuir fit with a proper agreement (r2 = 0.967) of about 2.56 × 10–4 mol g–1. One may think that this low adsorption results from a lack of hydrophobic
environment and the presence of repulsive electrostatic interaction
involved between the anionic SMX and the negatively surface charges
of raw clay mineral, it is however not the case here. Indeed, at high-concentration
regime, the total introduced number of moles was about 8 × 10–5 mol for 100 mg of layered material (i.e., concentration
of SMX was about 400 mg L–1), where thus 2.67 ×
10–5 mol is in a zwitterionic form, and thus leading
to a theoretical maximum value of 2.67 × 10–4 mol g–1. The difference between the experimental
and expected values represents less than 4%, suggesting that in the
case of Na-Mt, the whole zwitterionic SMX is adsorbed which was also
observed in the case of AMX, where the adsorbed amount reached a value
of about 9.29 × 10–4 mol g–1. In addition to the diversity in both their moieties and molecular
size, probably, the main difference
between these two pharmaceuticals remains in the balance change between
the zwitterionic and anionic forms which considerably impact the resulting
adsorbed amounts leading nevertheless to the intercalation of the
pharmaceuticals within the interlayer space of Na-Mt (XRD data not
shown). Similar processes occur for organoclays (Brij0.4-Mt and BDTA0.4-Mt) able to mobilize their inorganic cations
in addition to a hydrophobic environment that enhances particularly
the adsorption of SMX in both zwitterionic and anionic forms reaching
adsorbed amounts of 6.97 × 10–4 and 7.71 ×
10–4 mol g–1 for Brij0.4-Mt and BDTA0.4-Mt, respectively (Table 1). Finally, as explained in the frame of
AMX adsorption, BDTA-Mt with its slight excess of cationic charges
strongly improves the adsorption with almost a total confinement of
SMX within the hydrophobic brush generated by the long alkyl chains
of grafted BDTA+ in the internal structure of the organoclay
(similar FTIR observations as the adsorption of AMX, data not shown).

fits by using the Langmuir equation model.

3.3.3 Adsorption of the Trimethoprim
If both SMX and AMX show trends and affinities similar to organoclays
due probably to similar zwitterionic–anionic couples with however
a different ratio between these species, TRI radically differs showing
mainly cations in solution at a pH of 6.5 (Figure 2).7,8 Thus, the resulting
adsorption isotherms at the equilibrium display different line shapes
than those previously observed for both SMX and AMX, with the distinction
of two main regimes: (i) a gradual growth of the adsorbed amount and
(ii) a steady state at high equilibrium concentration (Figure 10). Besides showing a more
pronounced hydrophobic character, it appears that it is principally
the charge of the pharmaceutical that drives to the adsorption. Thus,
with about 80% TRI cationic species, the adsorption is particularly
enhanced onto the phyllosilicate sheets of Na-Mt with a maximum adsorbed
amount standing at 3.80 × 10–4 mol g–1 (half of the CEC value), underlining its intercalation through cation
exchange within the interlayer (confirmed by XRD—data not shown).7,8 Because both BDTA0.4-Mt and Brij0.4-Mt showing
a dual hydrophobic/hydrophilic behavior and thus providing diverse
adsorption sites including the possibility to perform some cation
exchanges which is more probably exacerbated in the case of nonionic
organoclay,24 TRI reaches a maximum adsorbed
amount of about 3–4 × 10–4 mol g–1, equivalent as Na-Mt. Nevertheless, the nonionic
organoclay appears here to be the most efficient sorbent because it
offers a good compromise between the preservation of the adsorption
sites for cation exchange and the hydrophobic environment generated
by the presence of surfactants that here enhances the adsorption besides
possible steric hindrance that may limit the diffusion of the hydrophobic
pharmaceutical. As already observed, cationic organoclays (organophilic
ones prepared with long alkyl chains above 1 CEC) and thus including
BDTA-Mt show their limits for the adsorption of cationic compounds
such as TRI, besides its large log P which in this
case is essentially trapped in its zwitterionic form through molecular
hydrophobic and π–π interactions and thus its mass
transfer at about 2.59 × 10–4 mol g–1.

3.4 Competitive Adsorption of the Antibiotics
on the Layered Materials
Thus, from all of the results, it
appears that the electrical charge of the pharmaceuticals mainly governs
the degree of adsorption and the hydrophobic character plays a second
role. By comparing the parameters derived from the fitting procedure
and, in particular, those of the Freundlich model which takes into
account the adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces (which is the case
here with layered materials showing various adsorption sites) in which
the interaction between the antibiotics and the mineral surface is
not restricted to the formation of a monolayer, one can estimate precisely
the affinity for each organic compound/layered material couple. More
precisely, the Freundlich constant KF determined
with the fitting procedure, where r2 >
0.936 (Table 1) attesting
the good agreement of the experimental data, assesses the ability
of a material to reduce an amount of pollutants per gram of the adsorbent
used or represent the affinity of the compounds with a material. For
both AMX and SMX, the KF ranking highlights
the interests of both the cationic and nonionic organoclays (Table 1). Indeed, KF reaches 0.122 and 0.0785 L mol–1 for BDTA-Mt and Brij0.4-Mt, respectively, for AMX, 1
order of magnitude lower nevertheless to those related to biochar,
activated carbon, and even organoclays in the literature.6,10,17,29 In these previous studies where the investigated materials were
suggested as possible solution for the treatment of water, the studied
AMX concentration range was much shorter and, interestingly, a steady
state was reached in contrast to the study here where no plateau is
observed and the adsorbed amount is nevertheless 10 times larger.
Nevertheless, this study points out the particular affinity of organoclays
for zwitterionic compounds, and the nonionic organoclay appears to
be the most polyvalent layered material because of its singular ability
to perform cation exchanges while involving hydrophobic interaction
in the adsorption.24

Numerous works
focused their efforts on the understanding of the adsorption mechanisms
of a pool of different organic pollutants (cocktail) in the natural
sample with both natural and synthetic materials for an environmental
purpose, without any control of the parameters that may influence
the sorption.1,3,12,13 Thus, such chemical engineering approach
leads to an assessment of the efficiency about the use of materials
as sorbents without giving any precise information’s about
the processes governing the adsorption of each pollutants.3,13 In contrast, in this study, the whole parameters (or degrees of
freedom) are fixed as well as the knowledge of the organic compounds
and the resulting interaction mechanisms leading to the adsorption
which represents the first step before to think to work on complex
mixtures where antagonist effects may occur and complicate the interpretation
of the data. In order to probe an effect of a competition, the use
of HPLC coupled to MS was necessary.3,13 The experiments
with a pool of pharmaceuticals consisted to get equilibrium adsorption
isotherms, as obtained for individual antibiotics over nevertheless
a restricted concentration range with a special care to avoid any
precipitation and by fixing for each measurement the same starting
concentration for every compounds. With these experiments, several
issues were raised including: (i) the ability of different materials
to adsorb the totality of the antibiotics and in which extent; (ii)
the possibility of a release; (iii) the possible association of antibiotics
which may enhance to or limit the adsorption; and (iv) the fate of
a pool of organic compounds with a clay mineral that can, after being
in contact, form an organoclay (different to hybrid materials prepared
with surfactants), of which the chemicals by lining its surface can
facilitate subsequently further adsorption.

The resulting adsorption
isotherms, in particular those relative
to the Brij0.4-Mt, confirm the affinity of the whole antibiotics
toward the layered materials, which seem to offer sufficient sites
to completely adsorb the pharmaceuticals with nevertheless the observation
of a plateau (Figure 11, see Figures SI-4 and SI-5 for the adsorption
isotherms of the antibiotics onto Na-Mt and BDTA-Mt). Here, the saturation
of the adsorption can be related to a competition effect of the species
for the different adsorption sites thus limiting their mass transfer
onto the layered materials which, indeed, differs from the individual
adsorption isotherms of AMX and SMX (Figures 4 and 9) displaying
no steady state. However, the line shapes of the isotherms mainly
depend on the type of layered materials as well as the nature of the
antibiotics where the saturation is not reached for SMX on BDTA-Mt
for instance. As it was observed for the individual adsorption of
the antibiotics where the nonionic organoclay appears to be the most
versatile material, the same observation occurs in the context of
a pool of pharmaceuticals, where here consists of a mixture of cations
(TRI), anions (SMX and AMX), and zwitterions (AMX, SMX, and TRI).
Indeed, the sum of the adsorbed amounts of all of the antibiotics
reaches 4.8 × 10–4, 3.6 × 10–4, and 3.4 × 10–4 mol g–1 for Brij0.4-Mt, Na-Mt, and BDTA-Mt, respectively, underlining
if one uses the total adsorbed quantity as a parameter to list the
layered materials, the efficiency of the nonionic organoclay. Interestingly,
the cationic organoclay which appeared previously in the individual
adsorption as an efficient material to uptake the pollutants suffers
from a competition effect that limits considerably the adsorbed amounts
(Figure SI-5). In contrast, the adsorption
appears to be enhanced on Na-Mt once in contact with numerous compounds
where probably the adsorption of some pharmaceuticals modifies the
nature of the mineral surface leading to an improvement of further
molecules (Figure SI-4). However, besides
some adsorption kinetical experiments were performed, it was rather
hard to precisely determine the nature of the antibiotics adsorbed
in the first step (if TRI as a cationic compound was adsorbed primarily
for instance), or probably the adsorption results here to a combination
of organic compounds on a mineral phase showing a large number of
accessible sites. This requires additional experiments and will be
investigated in the next future work.

Figure 11 Equilibrium adsorption
isotherms of a pool of antibiotics: amoxicillin
(AMX) in black circle, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in dark gray circle,
and trimethoprim (TRI) in light gray circle onto Brij0.4-Mt organoclay (other data related of the adsorption of a pool of
PP onto Na-Mt and BDTA-Mt are shown in the Supporting Information). The solid lines represent the fits by using the
Langmuir equation model.

If the maximal adsorbed amount can be used as a pertinent
parameter
to compare the efficiency of the layered materials on the same concentration
range, it is not relevant for the estimation of a change of affinity
(i.e., between mineral phases and the pharmaceuticals) in the case
of a pool of antibiotics (where the concentration range differed). KF, already used to discuss the adsorption capacity
of the layered materials to literature data, expresses a real contrast
regarding the degree of adsorption toward each antibiotic in a situation
of mixing. Despite the versatility of the interaction mechanisms implied
with AMX,6,10,17,29 this zwitterion compound appears to suffer the most
from the competition with the two other antibiotics. Indeed, the resulting KF constants are much smaller than those previously
determined when AMX was individually adsorbed on the layered materials
(Table 1). In contrast,
both TRI and SMX antibiotics seem to take advantage or benefit of
the competition because their KF constants
increase of several percent from 23 to 147% (except that one of TRI
with BDTA-Mt, which is not a surprise and quite logic with regards
to the absence of adsorption sites in BDTA-Mt for cationic compounds).
Such difference behavior among the antibiotics is quite interesting
because it was expected to get a decrease of the affinity for the
whole investigated antibiotics which can also be determined by the
removal percentages (Table 2). AMX, with its extreme versatility, was easily adsorbed
on every different layered materials without the presence of other
molecules but suffer from molecules of which bold electric charge
once mixed all together and in competition to the adsorption onto
the layered materials (Figure 12). The introduction of bold electric charged molecules
such as SMX and TRI may play the role of electrolytes, disrupting
strongly the interactional mechanisms leading to the decrease of the
adsorption of AMX (Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, interestingly,
TRI and SMX benefit from the competition effect by showing an improvement
of their affinity to every adsorbents which can be explained through
a possible combination of these two species in solution.8,20 Indeed, it is important to mention that these two compounds are
often administered in tandem that can find a meaning beyond the therapeutical
aspect through their possible ionic combination facilitating then
their assimilation within the carrier mineral phases.

of the possible interaction mechanisms
leading to the adsorption of the antibiotics: AMX, SMX, and TRI onto
Na-Mt, Brij0.4-Mt, BDTA0.4-Mt, and BDTA-Mt.
In the case of a pool of pharmaceuticals, it leads to a decrease of
the affinity of AMX with the whole studied layered materials because
of the presence of electrolytes: bold charged SMX and TRI molecules
which show an enhancement of the adsorption, probably due to their
possible association.

4 Conclusions
The understanding of the interactional mechanisms leading to the
adsorption of pharmaceuticals defined recently as emerging pollutants
(because these organics are massively administered with the growth
of the aging population in our modern societies which thus represent
a serious concern) on both untreated and modified by surfactants (organoclays)
clay minerals can give important insights into the development of
novel sorbents for environmental issues (water treatment). It also
concerns the fate of pollutants associated with mineral phases where
the stability of the organo-mineral complexes depends on the resulting
forces between adsorbent and analytes that can fluctuate, driving
to a release of the confined or adsorbed pollutants with a change
of the experimental conditions.

In this study, we focused on
the adsorption of three antibiotics,
showing different electric charges and quite complex species with
functional groups as diverse as their therapeutic uses, on four layered
materials based on a clay mineral that can play the role of holding
phases of pollutants that can be easily released following the experimental
conditions. With the set of complementary data, it appears that the
electric charge mainly controls the adsorption and the hydrophobic
behavior plays a second role but seems to improve the adsorbed amounts.
In particular, the nonionic organoclay demonstrates again its versatility
in the adsorption in both individual adsorption and in mixing conditions
where competition between antibiotics was expected. Mixing three antibiotics
allowed us to simply mimic the natural context, where the mineral
phases are often in contact with a cocktail of pollutants (or organic
matter), amplifying their toxicity, but where the competition significantly
perturbs the adsorption behavior of the species (in contrast to the
individual situation). This competition leads to a decrease of the
affinity of the AMX in the presence of other molecules (or electrolytes)
where however its zwitterion feature allows an easy adsorption on
the whole materials in large amounts. In contrast, both SMX and TRI
once mixed are easily adsorbed. This surprising observation of the
enhancement of the adsorption of TRI and SMX may be related to a possible
association of these two species adding a synergistic effect, important
to be taken into account in the natural context where such phenomenon
is surely transposable and observable but requires further experiments
with additional molecules in competition to properly highlight it.
