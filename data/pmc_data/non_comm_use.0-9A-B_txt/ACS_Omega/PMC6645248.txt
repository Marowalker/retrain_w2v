Iron porphyrin catalysts
of the luminol reaction (horseradish peroxidase,
hemoglobin, cytochrome c, and hemin) interact with
diverse reducing compounds. Here, it is demonstrated how the chemiluminescence
yield is modulated by such interactions. The compounds accepted as
substrates protect the catalyst against the “suicide inactivation”
caused by high peroxide concentrations. The reducing agents not accepted
by the catalyst inhibit light production either by generating a futile
redox cycle of the luminophore or by irreversibly inactivating the
catalytic center. In the case of a futile cycle, light emission resumes
as soon as the reducing agents in the reaction are consumed, whereas
with an irreversible inactivation, light emission does not recover.
The characteristics of luminescence enhancement and quenching depending
on interfering agents are also reported here. They reveal details
about the relative redox potentials of the involved compounds. It
is discussed how this should be considered when the luminol reaction
is used for quantitative analyses and when unpurified samples with
a broad compound matrix are to be assayed.

Introduction
Chemiluminescence based
on the luminol reaction is used for many
different applications (details in the Discussion section). The reaction mechanism is complex and needs alkaline pH
to provide luminol monoanion (LH–) and involves
diverse intermediates such as a radical form of luminol (L–•), azaquinone (AQ) and finally the light-emitting species aminophthalate
(AP*). The reaction is most efficiently catalyzed by heme proteins.
However, the light yield of the reaction decays under harsh oxidizing
conditions ([H2O2] ≥ 1 mM). This “suicide
inactivation” is an undesired effect when the luminol reaction
is to be used with quantitative assays. Strategies have been reported
to avoid “suicide inactivation” by improving the heme
catalyst.1−9 However, the precise adjustment of the assay ingredients can generate
a long-lasting glow-type luminescence of high intensity.10,11 This study is intended to demonstrate the diversity of compounds
which are able to boost or otherwise influence the luminol reaction.
It shows how important the balance of the two substrates (i.e., luminol
and peroxide) is and how the light yield and luminescence kinetics
are amplified or reduced by phenolic compounds, antioxidants (AOs),
or reducing agents. Experiments are presented, which allow a ranking
of reducing agents with respect to their redox potential relative
to the substrates and catalysts of the luminol reaction. Finally,
important considerations necessary for the design of sensitive and
highly specific quantitative luminol-based assays are discussed.

Results
Luminol
Protects Heme Catalysts from Peroxide-Induced “Suicide
Inactivation”
Luminol (LH–) delivers
electrons to heme and thereby prevents the over-oxidation and disintegration
of the catalytic center by H2O2. This protective
effect of luminol can be verified when the dependency of luminescence
on [H2O2] is studied at various luminol concentrations.
The data (Figure 1)
clearly show that the inhibition of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed
luminol reaction by H2O2 shifts toward higher
[H2O2] when [LH–] is increased.
The effective concentrations for 50% inhibition (IC50)
were determined for each [LH–] by sigmoidal four-parametric
logistic fit of the data (Supporting Information, Table S1.1).

Figure 1 Dependence of luminescence on [H2O2] and
luminol concentration [LH–] with HRP as the catalyst
and protection from “suicide inactivation”. (A) Luminescence,
integrated over the first 15 min of the reaction, is plotted against
[H2O2]. The reactions were started by injecting
a mixture of the catalyst and luminol into a H2O2 solution to reach the following assay conditions: 100 mM Tris/HCl
pH = 9; [HRP] = 2.5 μg/mL; [LH–] as indicated
in the inset; and [H2O2] is given by the abscissa.
(B) Data (ILY) were normalized by the
mean of each data set to facilitate direct comparison. Data are the
averages of n = 4 technical replicates. The error
bars represent standard deviation (SD). SD is below the symbol size,
where no error bar can be seen.

This shows that as more luminol is consumed, the “suicide
inactivation” effect is shifted more toward higher [H2O2]. Doubling [LH–] roughly doubled
IC50. Similar results were obtained with Cyt c (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Reducing Agents Quench Luminescence and Exert a Delay Effect
on the Light-Yielding Reaction
Because luminol protects the
catalysts from “suicide inactivation” (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1) and thereby exerts an antioxidative
effect on the catalytic heme core, the effect of other AOs on heme
destruction by high [H2O2] was tested. The most
abundant AO found in vivo is glutathione (GSH). Therefore, the sensitivity
of HRP to high [H2O2] was tested using GSH as
described above. The results (Figure 2) reveal that GSH reduces the luminescence significantly
but does not exert a protective effect on HRP. This can be seen directly
because the peroxide-based inhibition does not shift toward higher
[H2O2] (Figure 2) as was observed when [LH–] was
varied (Figure 1).
The IC50 values calculated from this data set (Figure 2) are presented in
the Supporting Information (Table S1.2).

Figure 2 Dependence
of luminescence on [H2O2] and
GSH concentration with HRP as the catalyst. Assay conditions: 100
mM Tris/HCl pH = 9; [LH–] = 750 μM; [HRP]
= 2 μg/mL; [GSH] is indicated in the inset; and the luminescence
is plotted against [H2O2]. The luminescence
data represent light yield (ILY) integrated
over the first 15 min of the reaction. Data are the averages of n = 3 technical replicates. Error bars represent SD. SD
is below the symbol size, where no error bar can be seen.

There are three possible mechanisms which may explain
the reduction
of light yield (i.e., luminescence quenching) caused by GSH as shown
in Figure 2:#1 The catalyst
abstracts electrons from
GSH to produce GS• radicals (eq 1), which lead to the oxidized form GSSG (eq 2).

 1   2  #2 GSH is in competition
with luminol
radicals L–•, donating H+ and
e– to L–•, thus recycling
it back to LH–, and thereby preventing the light-yielding
reaction (eq 3).

 3  

This would
imply that GS• has a redox potential
that is too low to abstract e– from LH–.#3 The catalyst is permanently inhibited
by GSH and thus inactivated. Luminescence is thereby permanently quenched
because of a decrease of the heme catalyst concentration.



The first two mechanisms imply that GSH
renders the catalyzed luminol
reaction futile. GSH is consumed either by the catalyst (eqs 1 and 2) or
by L–• (eq 3) and thus constitutes a factor that only transiently
disturbs the luminol reaction, as long as GSH is present.

The
kinetics (Figure 3A,C)
indeed reveal that the light yield is low in the presence of
GSH but resumes as soon as all GSH is consumed. Both the extent of
luminescence quenching during the delay period (Figure 4A, the quenching effect) and the duration
of the delay period until the reaction resumes light emission depend
on [GSH] (Supporting Information, Figure
S2B). This effect was observed even at the nanomolar concentrations
of GSH and confirms that the catalyst is not permanently affected
(i.e., mechanism #3 does not apply).

Figure 3 Effect of GSH and NADH on the kinetics
of the luminol reaction
catalyzed by HRP and Cyt c. (A) Luminol luminescence
catalyzed by HRP is quenched and delayed by GSH. It resumes when all
AOs in the reaction are consumed. The lower the [GSH], the shorter
is the luminescence delay time. (B) Same effect is observed with NADH
as an AO. (C) GSH is also able to quench and delay luminescence when
it is catalyzed by Cyt c. (D) However, when the experiment
is performed with NADH, no delay effect can be seen, when Cyt c is the catalyst. Instead, luminescence is permanently
quenched because Cyt c is reduced by NADH in the
presence of H2O2, and thereby, the catalyst
is withdrawn from the reaction. The reactions were started by injecting
H2O2 into a mixture of the catalyst, luminol,
and the reducing agent to reach the following assay conditions: Tris/HCl
100 mM pH = 9; [Cyt c] = 20 μg/mL; HRP 0.75
μg/mL; [LH–] = 750 μM;. [H2O2 ] = 1.1 mM; and reducing agents as indicated in the
insets in micromolar.

Figure 4 Initial quenching effect of GSH and NADH on the luminol reaction
catalyzed by diverse catalysts. Various concentrations of GSH and
NADH were tested for their ability to reduce the light emission of
the luminol reaction. The relative light yield integrated over the
first minute of each reaction is plotted against the respective concentration
of GSH (A) and NADH (B). Data are normalized by the luminescence obtained
without AOs. The reactions were started by injecting H2O2 into a mixture of the catalyst, luminol, and the reducing
agent to reach the following assay conditions: Tris/HCl 100 mM pH
= 9; [LH–] = 750 μM; [H2O2] = 1.1 mM; and catalysts are indicated in the inset: [HRP] = 0.75
μg/mL; [Cyt c] = 15 μg/mL; [Hemin] =
1 μM; [Hb] = 20 μg/mL; and [FeEDDHA] = 200 μM; data
are means of n = 3 technical replicates. Error bars
represent SD. SD is below the symbol size where no error bar can be
seen.

However, the delay effect on light
production was not observed
with all reducing agents and catalysts. This is because some reducing
agents directly affect the catalyst and thereby decrease its light-yielding
efficiency by mechanism #3 mentioned above. This is demonstrated with
Cyt c (Figure 3C,D). Nicotinamide–adenine–dinucleotide
disodium (NADH) is the most abundant redox cofactor in living cells
and is able to affect Cyt c in the presence of peroxides.12 This results in permanent luminescence quenching
by NADH (Figure 3D),
and the kinetics do not exhibit the onset of delayed light yield.
GSH in contrast seems not to affect Cyt c (Figure 3C).

A quenching
effect, be it produced by a futile cycle (mechanisms
#1 and #2) or by the inactivation of the catalyst (mechanism #3),
can be observed with any reducing agent and any catalyst that drives
the luminol reaction. The curves (Figure 4) showing the initial degree of luminescence
quenching with respect to the concentration of the reducing agent
in the assay are possibly characteristic for the redox potential of
the involved reducing agent relative to the potential of H2O2, catalyst, and luminol. Other tested reducing agents
(ascorbate, dithiothreitol, uric acid, trolox, and sulfite) produce
other characteristic inhibition curves with each catalyst (Supporting Information, Figure S3.1).

Enhancement
of Luminescence by Aromatic Hydrogen (AH) Donors
The luminol
reaction driven by a genuine peroxidase can be enhanced
by a number of aromatic compounds.13−19 Such compounds are typical hydrogen donors (AH), which are preferably
accepted by the peroxidase as substrates. However, at low concentrations,
they do not inhibit the light-yielding reaction as AOs do but rather
boost it by orders of magnitude (Figure 5) because their radical form (A•) abstracts hydrogen from luminol.18 In
this way, they are able to work as redox mediators and thus amplify
the turnover and oxidation power of the catalyst.

Figure 5 Effect of IP on the luminol
reaction catalyzed by various catalysts.
Various concentrations of IP were tested for their ability to boost
the light-yielding reaction. The relative light yield of each reaction
is plotted against the respective IP concentration. Only the HRP-catalyzed
reaction is enhanced by a factor of about 40, when [IP] is around
200 μM. The efficiency of other catalysts cannot be enhanced
by IP. The reactions were started by injecting H2O2 into a mixture of the catalyst, luminol, and IP to reach
the following assay conditions: Tris/HCl 100 mM pH = 9; [LH–] = 750 μM; [H2O2] = 1.1 mM; and catalysts
are indicated in the inset: [HRP] = 0.375 μg/mL; [Cyt c] = 3.75 μg/mL; [Hemin] = 1.5 μM; [FeEDDHA]
= 200 μM; and [Hb] = 20 μg/mL. Data are normalized by
the luminescence obtained without IP. Data are means of n = 4 technical replicates. Error bars represent SD. SD is below the
symbol size where no error bar can be seen.

It is important to note that the enhancing effect is only
seen
with HRP (green symbols, Figure 5). There is an optimal concentration of enhancers giving
the HRP reaction a maximum boost of light emission by a factor of
10–100 (Figure 5; Supporting Information, Figure S4.1).
The luminol reaction driven by other heme catalysts (i.e., the so-called
“pseudo-peroxidases”) cannot be enhanced this way. Enhancers
at high concentrations inhibit the light reaction with all other catalysts
tested (Figure 5).
This effect is comparable with the luminescence quenching caused by
AOs (Figure 4). Similar
results to those in Figure 5 have been obtained with benzidine and coumarin as enhancers
(Supporting Information, Figure S4.1).

Enhancers Protect HRP from Peroxide-Induced “Suicide
Inactivation”
Apart from boosting the reaction, the
enhancers also protect the HRP from “suicide inactivation”
(Figure 6). With an
increasing enhancer concentration, the inhibitory effect shifts toward
higher [H2O2]. The half-inhibitory H2O2 concentration (IC50) correlates and increases
with increasing [IP] (Supporting Information, Table S4.1). This effect is similar to that seen when the luminol
concentration is increased (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Table S1.1) and confirms the direct interaction of the enhancer
with HRP.

Figure 6 Dependence of luminescence on [H2O2] and
IP and the protection from “suicide inhibition”. [IP]
is indicated in the inset, and luminescence is plotted against [H2O2] in order to demonstrate that the peroxide-induced
inhibition of the reaction shifts toward higher [H2O2] with increasing [IP]. The reactions were started by injecting
H2O2 into a mixture of HRP, luminol, and IP
to reach the following assay conditions: Tris/HCl 100 mM pH = 9; [LH–] = 750 μM; [HRP] = 0.125 μg/mL; data are
averages of n = 3 technical replicates. Error bars
represent SD. SD is below the symbol size, where no error bar can
be seen.

Discussion
The
“suicide inactivation” caused by H2O2 and the antioxidative “shielding effect”
of LH–, which lowers the sensitivity of the heme
catalyst to H2O2, is demonstrated in Figure 1 and Supporting Information (Figure S1 and Table S1.1).
Shielding is efficient as long as there is a balance between [H2O2] and [LH–] in the assay (i.e.,
[LH–] ≥ [H2O2]). A
large excess of [H2O2] over [LH–] leads to the destruction of the heme catalyst. A similar “shielding
effect” is also seen with the enhancers of the HRP-catalyzed
reaction such as iodophenol (IP) or benzidine (Figure 6; Supporting Information, Figure S4.2 and Table S4.1). This suggests that, like luminol,
the enhancers are also accepted by HRP as substrates. They exhibit
a concentration optimum, providing a maximum enhancement of light
yield (ILY). Here (Figure 5), the IP concentration for maximal enhancement
of the HRP-catalyzed reaction is around 200 μM, which is in
good agreement with the results reported by Bhandari et al.20 In contrast, Yakunin and Hallenbeck21 reported a maximal enhancement at [IP] = 4 mM,
which might be caused by the much higher [H2O2] of 17.6 mM they used. For optimal enhancement and minimal “suicide
inactivation”, luminol, enhancer, and peroxide concentrations
must be well balanced. Consequently, at [H2O2] = 17.6 mM, an equivalent high enhancer concentration (4 mM) was
necessary to prevent “suicide inactivation”.21

Luminol reactions catalyzed by heme compounds
other than HRP (i.e.,
Cyt c, Hb, and Hemin) could not be enhanced by the
phenolic compounds tested here. Their integrated light yield (ILY) decreases with increasing enhancer concentrations
(Figure 5; Supporting Information S4.1) as it does with
nonenhancing AOs (Figure 4; Supporting Information, Figure
S3.1). In the following, it is discussed how this can reveal details
about the redox properties of these catalysts.

Luminescence Quenching
and Delay Are Caused by AOs
Any reducing agent or AO can
interfere with the peroxidative cycle
and thereby inhibit the light-yielding luminol reaction to some extent
(Figure 4; and Supporting Information, Figure S3.1). Generalizing
the assumptions made for GSH above (eqs 1–3), different mechanisms
of interference are imaginable (Figure 7), which depend on the relative redox potentials of
the AO, L, and catalyst:#1 AOred serves as an immediate
donor, delivering electrons to the catalyst and the resulting radicals
(AO•) form an oxidized product AOox (Figure 7A). In this way,
luminol is left unaltered as long as the peroxidative cycle is busy
with AOred. This suggests that the catalyst prefers AOred and rejects LH– as a substrate, possibly
because of the more negative redox potential of AOred relative
to LH–. If AOred was GSH, then this scheme
(Figure 7A) would resemble
the activity of a GSH peroxidase.22

#2 The peroxidative cycle
abstracts electrons
preferably from LH– to produce L–•. However, L–• is scavenged by AOred and therefore cannot yield light (Figure 7B) because [AOred] is in excess
over [L–•]. Instead, it is recycled in a
futile cycle. This implies that AOred has a negative redox
potential relative to L–• and that AO• is unable to exchange electrons with L•–.18

#3 AOred in combination with
H2O2 inactivates the heme catalyst and thus
eliminates it from the reaction cycle (Figure 7C). This may occur via a reduction of the
protein by opening of disulfide bridges in combination with a reductive
liberation of FeII or FeIII from the heme.12 Consequently, luminescence is quenched by the
depletion of the heme catalyst with no recovery of light emission
(Figure 3D), whereas
a light emission recovery (Figure 3A–C; Supporting Information, Figure S2A) can be explained only by one of the first two mechanisms
(Figure 7A,B).



Figure 7 Possible mechanisms explaining the interference of AOs
with the
luminol reaction catalyzed by the peroxidative cycle. The light yield
of the peroxidase-catalyzed luminol reaction is reduced as long as
a competitive AO (AOred) is present. AOred is
turned into its oxidized form (AOox) by the peroxidative
cycle and thus competes with luminol. Depending on its reduction power,
AOred interferes directly and exclusively with the catalyst,
leaving LH– unattached (A) or it recycles L–• back to LH– in a futile
cycle (B). These scenarios (A,B) imply that light emission resumes
as soon as all AOred is consumed and converted into AOox. No resumption of light emission occurs when AOred in collaboration with H2O2 inactivates the
catalyst irreversibly (C).

Although Figure 1 and Supporting Information (Figure
S1)
demonstrate that a reducing substrate (here LH–)
can protect the heme core of the catalyst from being destroyed by
H2O2, this is not generally the case for any
other reducing agent (AOred). In the presence of GSH, for
instance, the light yield of the reaction is drastically reduced (Figures 3A,C; 4A), but the inhibitory effect of H2O2 is not shifted toward higher [H2O2] (Figure 2; Supporting Information, Table S1.2) as is the case for luminol
(Figure 1; Supporting Information, Table S1). Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that mechanism #1 (Figure 7A) does not apply and that GSH does not directly
interact with the catalyst but rather draws electrons from L–• to become GSSH according to mechanism #2 (eq 3 and Figure 7B). A similar mechanism of GSH oxidation has been proposed
earlier for quinones other than luminol.23

When the extent of luminescence quenching is plotted against
the
concentration of the respective AOred (Figure 4), it is evident that there
are different mechanisms by which the reducing agent affects the catalysis
of the luminol reaction. GSH for instance starts to produce an effect
on the Cyt c-catalyzed reaction at a concentration
of about 10 μM (pink symbols in Figure 4A), whereas higher NADH concentrations (80
μM; pink symbols in Figure 4B) are needed to produce this effect. This is not only
due to the different redox potentials of GSH and NADH but also depends
on the inhibition mechanism (Figure 7), as can be seen in the kinetics (compare Figure 3C,D).

In most
cases, the addition of AOred to the luminol
reaction leads to a delay of light emission (Figure 3A–C), and the delay time is dependent
on the AOred concentration (Supporting Information, Figure S2B). This is in agreement with previous
reports10,11,24−28 and reveals that AOred is oxidized in the course of the
reaction (mechanisms #1 and #2; Figure 7A,B). It implies that light emission resumes when all
AOred in the reaction cocktail is consumed (Figure 3A–C). However, when
AOred inactivates the catalyst (mechanism #3; Figure 7C), then the reaction
is quenched with no delayed resumption of light. This effect is seen
when Cyt c-catalyzed luminescence is quenched by
NADH (Figure 3D).

It is also possible that different quenching mechanisms (Figure 7) are working simultaneously.
This is evident when the luminescence quenching of the Cyt c-catalyzed reaction by GSH (pink symbols in Figure 4A) is compared with the inhibition
of the HRP-catalyzed reaction (green symbols in Figure 4A). The inhibitory effect on Cyt c follows a simple sigmoid curve. Here, a single IC50 value of 41 μM could be deduced by fitting a four-parameter
logistic curve to the data, which reveals an apparent single inhibition
mechanism (Supporting Information, Figure
S3.2A). The inhibition of HRP by GSH, in contrast, is of a biphasic
sigmoidal shape, revealing two IC50 values (4.3 and 276
μM; Supporting Information, Figure
S3.2B) and thus two different inhibition mechanisms occurring at different
GSH concentrations. The first (IC50 = 4.3 μM) is
possibly due to the role of GSH as an electron donor of the peroxidase
cycle. The second (IC50 = 276 μM) may be caused by
the reduction of disulfide bonds in the HRP and thus refolding of
the protein. Cyt c lacks disulfide bonds, and no
biphasic sigmoid is seen (Supporting Information, Figure S3.2A).

In conclusion, the curves showing the degree
of luminescence quenching
depending on the concentration of the reducing agent (AOred) are characteristic for each catalyst (Figure 4; Supporting Information, Figures S3.1; S3.2). In connection with the time kinetics of the
inhibited luminescence (Figure 3), they are able to unveil the details about both the quenching
mechanisms and the relative redox potentials of the components involved
(i.e., H2O2, catalyst, luminol, and AOred).

Can the Catalytic Heme Core Be Protected against “Suicide
Inactivation”?
The inactivation of peroxidases by
excess [H2O2] limits their use in many applications.
Consequently, there have been many approaches to prevent “suicide
inactivation”.1−9 A reasonable concentration of the reducing substrate is sufficient
to limit the inactivation (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Table S1.1). The effect of LH– is also seen with
Cyt c (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The oxidizing substrate H2O2 is
of less harm as long as there is enough reducing substrate LH– delivering electrons to the catalyst, shielding it
from over-oxidation. As mentioned above, the ratio of both substrates
([LH–]/[H2O2]) gives rise
to the shielding effect, and a proper balance can achieve a long-lasting
glow.

Some phenolic hydrogen donors (AH) enhance the light emission
when added to the luminol reaction. These so-called “enhancers”14,29 also shift the “suicide inactivation” of HRP to higher
[H2O2] (Figure 6; Supporting Information, Table S4.1) as was observed with luminol (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Table S1.1).

Seven reactions are crucial to understand the
enhanced peroxidase
luminol cycle (Supporting Information,
Table S4.220,30). The enhancer mechanism is similar
to the antioxidative mechanism #2 proposed above (Figure 7B), but with AH instead of
LH– and LH– instead of AOred (Figure 8B). It implies that (i) AH has a more negative redox potential relative
to cytochrome c peroxidase compound I (CMPI) and
CMPII and (ii) LH– has a more negative redox potential
relative to the oxidized product A•. This suggests
the following ranking of the involved components in terms of their
relative redox potentials: A• > L–• ≫ CMPI ≥ CMPII ≫ LH– >
AH.

Figure 8 Proposed “ping-pong” mechanisms of the enhanced catalytic
peroxidative cycle and the subsequent luminol reaction. (A) “Normal”
luminol reaction without an enhancer and (B) luminol reaction enhanced
by a redox mediator (AH). This implies that AH works as an intermediate
electron donor pool, which is favored by the catalyst as a substrate
over LH–. The radical A• is able
to join in electron exchange with LH– to produce
L–• and thus multiplies the oxidation power
and turnover of the catalyst. This drastically increases the light
yield. Schemes are adapted from ref (10). Numbers represent equations eqs S1–S7
in the Supporting Information (Table S4.2).

The effect of enhancers on the
light yield can be summarized by
three intertwined mechanisms in Figure 8B:#1 The enzyme (HRP) accepts the enhancer
(AH) as an immediate electron donor substrate more effectively than
luminol (LH–) because AH has a more negative redox
potential than LH– and because AH is more similar
to the phenolic substrates encountered by the enzyme in vivo than
LH–.

#2 The electron transfer between A–• and LH– is much more efficient
than between HRP and LH–, yielding much more light
when AH is present.

#3 AH suppresses the “suicide inactivation”
and protects the heme core of HRP from being destroyed by H2O2 and thereby prevents a decay of light yield.



The enhancing effect of phenolic compounds
(Figure 5; Supporting Information, Figure S4.1) can only
be observed with HRP. The luminol reaction
catalyzed by the other heme compounds tested here could not be enhanced
in this way. This confirms that HRP is a genuine peroxidase and is
thus much more than just a catalytic heme embedded in an inert protein
shell. Peroxidases such as HRP evolved in plants specifically to process
a broad spectrum of phenolic compounds. “Pseudo”-peroxidases
(e.g., Cyt c and Hb), in contrast, do not have this
substrate spectrum and only resemble the catalytic action of hemin.
In terms of peroxidase activity, the polypeptides of “pseudo”-peroxidases
simply fulfill an “egg-cup” function to hold the catalytic
porphyrin-coordinated iron in place.

The enhancing effect of
phenol derivatives on the HRP-catalyzed
reaction is prominent as long as [H2O2] <
10 mM (Figure 6; Supporting Information, Figure S4.2). At higher
[H2O2], the differences between the luminescence
from enhanced and nonenhanced reactions are less because of the “suicide
inactivation”.

The inactivation of the peroxidase activity
is an inherent property
of heme. Therefore, any attempts to make peroxidases less sensitive
to peroxide inactivation by molecular and genetic engineering must
focus on the development of means of arresting over-oxidation. This
task, however, presents a dilemma. On the one hand, the heme must
be shielded from too much peroxide. On the other hand, shielding must
not prevent access of heme to the reducing substrate. Nevertheless,
the report of the Cyt c triple mutant (N52I; Y67F;
C102T) demonstrates that it is possible to solve this problem.31

Luminol Reaction and Assay Design—Specific
Considerations
Light from luminol reactions is widely used
in many different applications
(details in Supporting Information 5).
Luminescence-based assays are nevertheless sometimes less accepted
because of their alleged lack of robustness and reproducibility. This
apparent disadvantage is due to the measuring principle with almost
black background (i.e., large signal-to-background ratio) and the
exceptional sensitivity of modern photodetectors. Even tiny variations
in pH, [LH–], [H2O2], [HRP],
or temperature will have an impact on the photon flux produced by
the reaction. In addition, the presence of enhancers and the diversity
of other compounds that are able to catalyze, boost, or otherwise
influence the luminol reaction also give rise to problems.

A
principal goal, when optimizing luminometric assays, is to obtain
a maximum period of long-lived light output (“glow”)
at a minimum of effort and cost. This means that buffer conditions
and concentrations of the catalyst, H2O2, and
luminol must be appropriately balanced. In particular, the assay pH
represents a dilemma because genuine peroxidases work best at pH ≤
9 and the luminol reaction requires alkaline pH ≥ 9. This is
detailed in Supporting Information 6. In
addition, many more factors such as detergents,32 organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),33,34 viscosity, ionic strength,20 halides,35 and the inadvertent presence of transition metals
should also be considered in assay design and improvement of assay
performance.

Luminol assays with catalytic mechanisms based
on free transition
metals are used to quantify these elements36 or [H2O2].37 However,
for [H2O2] quantification, a peroxidase-based
chemistry including enhancers is preferred.38−40

For the
quantification of AOs, two strategies are feasible.1 On the one hand, the
time of luminescence
delay (Figure 3A–C)
is a quantitative measure of antioxidative capacity in the sample
(Supporting Information, Figure S2B). This
requires a signal recording period which comprises the whole dark
period after sample application until light emission resumes.10 Consequently, the recording period varies with
the amount of AOs in the samples. This way of assaying AOs is not
only time-consuming but also inconvenient to implement into automated
plate reader assays. It requires appropriate sample dilution prior
to assaying to meet the recording time defined with the assay.

2 On the other hand, the extent
of luminescence
quenching can be used to quantify AOs. This appears the more reasonable
method because it requires only a defined short time period after
sample addition and also allows the quantification of reducing agents
which quench luminescence via catalyst reduction. In addition, HRP
is probably not the optimal catalyst for AO assays when the samples
contain enhancers (Figure 5; Supporting Information, Figure
S4.1) as these compounds antagonize the quenching effect of other
reducing analytes and thus lead to erroneous results. Consequently,
catalysts insensitive to enhancers, such as Cyt c, Hb, or Hemin, are preferable for AO assays.25



Any luminol-based assay, working
under well-defined laboratory
conditions, does not necessarily prove valid when “real”
samples are analyzed. “Real” samples are often neither
processed nor sufficiently pure to meet the required assay conditions,
and their complex compound matrix can interfere with the luminol reaction.
Consequently, assay results based on the luminol reaction are notorious
for misinterpretations when real samples are applied without circumspection.
This is particularly problematical, when the luminol reaction is used
in forensic chemistry, and the data obtained are used as evidence
before a court.41−45 In such cases, several different methods46 have to be applied to substantiate the result.

In summary,
the following results can be listed:#1 The reducing substrate luminol delivers
electrons to heme and thus prevents its disintegration by H2O2 (Figure 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1 and
Table S1.1). This protective antioxidative effect is efficient as
long as there is a balance between [H2O2], [LH–], and [catalyst] in the assay. “Suicide inactivation”
occurs when [H2O2] exceeds [LH–] by orders of magnitude.

#2 Nonsubstrate AOs or reducing agents
lead to a reduction and/or a delay of luminescence (Figures 3 and 4; Supporting Information, Figures S2–S3.1).

#3 The HRP-catalyzed luminol
reaction
can be enhanced by diverse aromatic hydrogen donors (Figure 5; Supporting Information Figure S4.1). Such enhancers exhibit, like luminol,
a protective antioxidative effect and prevent “suicide inactivation”
(Figure 6; Supporting Information, Figure S4.2; Table S4.1).

#4 Only the luminol reaction
catalyzed
by the genuine peroxidase (HRP) can be enhanced. Other heme catalysts
do not give rise to the enhancement of the light yield in the presence
of aromatic hydrogen donors (Figure 5; Supporting Information, Figure S4.1).



Conclusions
Because
the luminol reaction is complex (details in Supporting Information S6) and influenced by
many diverse parameters, the interpretation of luminol luminescence
is difficult when the assay data are obtained from the samples containing
a complex compound matrix. Thus, the design of luminometric assays
requires precise knowledge about the chemistry, as well as considerations
about the compound matrix in the samples to be assayed. The results
presented here add to our knowledge on the intertwined interactions
of substrates, redox modulators, and catalysts of the luminol reaction
and thereby draw attention to factors that should be considered for
optimal assay design.

and a starter solution for the luminol reaction: H2O2 in Tris working buffer.

Specific Material and Instrumentation
Luminescence
was recorded using 96-well microtiter plates (MTPs) with white flat
bottom (Greiner Bio-One #655075) readout by a plate reader Infinite
M200 pro with injection unit (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany).

Methods
Luminescence recording was performed at 28
°C with the plate reader specified above. Prefilled MTPs were
incubated for 1 h at 28 °C with sporadic shaking prior to recording.
Reactions were started by dispensing the complementary assay compounds
to prefilled wells.

To study the luminol-derived light yield
and its dependence on the hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH,
four H2O2 dilution series (1:2) were established
on an MTP. The dilution series were set up on two rows (150 μL
each well). After incubation (1 h at 28 °C), the reactions were
started by dispensing 50 μL of the catalyst dissolved in TriLu
buffer.

To unravel the effects of the reducing compounds, the
MTPs were
prefilled with the dilution series of the respective compound in TriLu
buffer supplemented with the correct catalyst concentration (150 μL
each well), and reactions were started by injecting 50 μL of
H2O2 as the starter solution.

Detailed
assay conditions for each experiment are given in the
figure legends.
