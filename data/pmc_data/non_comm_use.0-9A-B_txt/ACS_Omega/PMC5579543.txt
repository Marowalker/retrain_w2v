Flavin-containing
Trx reductase (TrxR) of Thermoplasma
acidophilum (Ta), a thermoacidophilic facultative
anaerobic archaeon, lacks the structural features for the binding
of 2′-phosphate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH), and this feature has justified the observed lack of activity
with NADPH; NADH has also been reported to be ineffective. Our recent
phylogenetic analysis identified Ta-TrxR as closely related to the
NADH-dependent enzymes of Thermotoga maritima and Desulfovibrio vulgaris, both
being anaerobic bacteria. This observation instigated a reexamination
of the activity of the enzyme, which showed that Ta-TrxR is NADH dependent;
the apparent Km for NADH was 3.1 μM,
a physiologically relevant value. This finding is consistent with
the observation that NADH:TrxR has thus far been found primarily in
anaerobic bacteria and archaea.

Introduction
The thioredoxin (Trx) system, which is
composed of Trx, Trx reductase
(TrxR), and a cognate reductant, is a key component of thiol-based
metabolic regulation in almost all living systems. It is often crucial
for the survival of these organisms through fluctuations in the availability
of energy nutrients and exposure to oxidants in their habitats.1−5 The Trx system implements this regulation through the oxidation
and reduction of specific redox-active cysteine pairs of target proteins
by the action of Trx, a small redox protein, thereby influencing their
catalytic or physical properties.1−5 In the process of reducing a target protein, the Cys residues of
the redox-active Cys-X-X-Cys motif (X, variable amino acid residue)
of Trx are oxidized. The resulting disulfide of Trx is then reduced
by TrxR,1−5 which is of two types: ferredoxin:Trx reductase5 that carries a [Fe4-S4] center and
receives electrons from reduced ferredoxin; and flavoprotein Trx reductase
that is often dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADPH) and consequently known as NADPH:TrxR or NTR.6 Interestingly, certain flavin-containing TrxRs from anaerobic
organisms do not use NADPH,7−10 and following are examples of this group (electron
donor for TrxR, source organism(s)) (Table 1): reduced ferredoxin,7Clostridium pasteurianum, a fermentative and obligate anaerobic bacterium; NADH,8,9Thermotoga maritima and Desulfovibrio vulgaris, a hyperthermophilic bacterium
and a mesophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium, respectively; NADH and
NADPH,10,11Pyrococcus horikoshii and Deinococcus radiophilus, a hyperthermophilic
archaeon and an aerobic mesophilic bacterium, respectively; reduced
coenzyme F420 or F420H2,12Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, a phylogenetically deeply rooted hyperthermophilic methane-producing
archaeon. The flavin-containing TrxR of Thermoplasma
acidophilum, a thermoacidophilic and facultative anaerobic
euryarchaeon, has also been identified as one such enzyme, as a recombinant
form of this enzyme (Ta-TrxR) has been shown to be unable to utilize
either NADPH or NADH as reductant.16 This
heterotroph utilizes peptides and carbohydrates via aerobic or anaerobic
respiration. In the absence of oxygen, it uses elemental sulfur as
a terminal electron acceptor and generates hydrogen sulfide.13,14T. acidophilum genome carries only
one Trx and one TrxR and thus the electron donor of Ta-TrxR would
be a key player in the response of the organism to nutrient limitation
and oxidative stress. Curiously, our recent bioinformatics analysis
suggested the possibility that Ta-TrxR is NADH dependent (Figure 1). The results of
our study with purified recombinant Ta-TrxR as presented in this report
indeed supported this hypothesis.

of target proteins, and oxidized Trx is reduced by TrxR with NADH.

Results
Generation
of Homogeneous Recombinant Forms of Thermoplasma acidophilum Trx and TrxR (Ta-Trx and
Ta-TrxR) Free of E. coli NTR
Ta-Trx and Ta-TrxR of Thermoplasma acidophilum were expressed in E. coli SHuffle
T7 Express (NEB, Ipswich, MA) in soluble forms and purified via Ni2+–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni–NTA) affinity chromatography
to homogeneity (Figure 2). This E. coli strain lacks trxB that encodes NTR,6 and this
design eliminated the chance of contamination of E.
coli NTR in purified proteins. The purified Ta-TrxR
preparations exhibited a typical A280/460nm value of 5, which is comparable to that of an E.
coli NTR preparation with full incorporation of FAD.15 The Ta-Trx preparation was proficient in reducing
insulin with dithiothreitol (DTT) as reductant.16

was used. M, Broad Range Protein Ladder (NEB, Ipswich, MA). Ta-Trx
and TrxR in a solution containing 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0) were analyzed.

Catalytic Properties of Ta-TrxR
The first attempt to
assay Trx reductase activity of Ta-TrxR involved coupling it with
insulin reduction, as with DTT as reductant for Ta-Trx-reduced insulin.
However, likely due to a low activity at 25 °C, Ta-TrxR did not
exhibit observable activity with NADH or NADPH as reductant; a high-temperature
assay was not possible due to denaturation of insulin. The next effort
involved spectrophotometric observation of NADH or NADPH oxidation,
and the reduction of Ta-Trx was coupled to the reduction of oxidized
glutathione, as described previously.12 This coupling helped to maintain the level of oxidized Trx constant.17 In this assay, NADH, but not NADPH, supported
activity; the reaction was monitored at 340 nm.12 With a fixed NADH concentration of 40 μM and at Ta-Trx
concentrations of 10 and 20 μM, Ta-TrxR exhibited specific activities
of 2.2 ± 0.3 and 3.5 ± 0.2 μmol min–1 mg–1, respectively; the activity values represented
an average over two measurements with a Ta-TrxR concentration of 50
nM.

For the reasons elaborated in Discussion, the further kinetic analysis of the NADH-dependent activity of
Ta-TrxR was performed with 5,5-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB)
as the disulfide substrate in place of Ta-Trx. In this assay, the
temperature and pH optima for the activity were found to be 70 °C
and 7.5, respectively. With the concentration of NADH varying in the
range of 1.6–40 μM and at a fixed concentration of 4
mM DTNB, the apparent values of Km for
NADH and Vmax were found to be 3.12 ±
0.45 μM and 7.28 ± 0.32 μmol min–1 mg–1, respectively (Figure 3A). Similarly, assays at a fixed NADH concentration
of 40 μM and in the DTNB concentration range of 0.05–4.5
mM yielded an apparent Km value of 2.93
± 0.16 mM for DTNB (Figure 3B), and the corresponding Vmax value was 10.08 ± 0.29 μmol min–1 mg–1. Selenite, lipoic acid, and oxidized glutathione
were not reduced by Ta-TrxR with NADH.

The substrates were 5,5-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic
acid (DTNB) and NADH. The assays were performed anaerobically under
N2 atmosphere (1.3 × 105 Pa) at 60 °C
in the assay mixture containing 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0), 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and NADH and
DTNB at concentrations as indicated. The assays were performed in

Comparative Analysis of Primary Structures of Ta-TrxR and Selected
TrxRs
A primary sequence alignment of Ta-TrxR, Ec-NTR, and
selected TrxRs of anaerobes is shown in Figure 4. All of these enzymes have been characterized
biochemically at the purified enzyme stage,6,8−10,16 and a comparison of
Ta-TrxR with the rest at the amino acid sequence level yielded the
following values (source organism, electron donor, %identity, and
%similarity to Ta-TrxR): P. horikoshii, NADH and NADPH, 40.0 and 53.9%; T. maritima, NADH, 39.1, 55.7%; D. vulgaris,
NADH, 31.3 and 48.8%; and E. coli,
NADPH, 25.7, 43.7%. Three key structural features of an NTR are the
dinucleotide-binding motifs for FAD and NADPH (DBMFAD and
DBMNADPH, respectively) and a redox-active Cys-X-X-Cys
motif, where X is a variable amino acid residue (Figure 4). The comparison presented
in Figure 4 and the
X-ray crystallographic structure of the enzyme16 show that most of the DBMFAD-related sequence
features of NTR are conserved in Ta-TrxR. However, this was not the
case for DBMNADPH,16,18 and the potential implications
of the observed differences are presented in Discussion.

Discussion
This
study was instigated by the results of our recent phylogenetic
analysis of low-molecular-mass flavin-containing TrxRs from several
archaea and bacteria (Figure 5).12 Some of these enzymes do not
utilize NADPH, even though they exhibit significant structural similarities
to NTR, and thus far NADH, ferredoxin, and coenzyme F420H2 have been identified as alternate electron donors.10,7,12 In this context, the observed
phylogenetic position of Ta-TrxR was intriguing. It belonged to the
non-NADPH I group and showed a close relationship with an NTR group
of methanogens from the class of Methanomicrobiales and certain bacteria
and archaea (Figure 5). Included in this group were TrxRs of Thermotoga
maritima and Desulfovibrio vulgaris (TrxR2).8,10 Both of these organisms are anaerobic bacteria,
and T. maritima is a thermophile.19,20 The T. maritima enzyme prefers NADH
over NADPH (Kmapp NADH = 7.3
μM; Kmapp NADPH = 780
μM), whereas TrxR2 of D. vulgaris exclusively uses NADH with an apparent Km of 5.6 μM.8,10 In the primary sequence, Ta-TrxR
was found to be closely related to the Pyrococcus horikoshii enzyme, moderately related to the D. vulgaris enzyme and distant from E. coli NTR.
Similar to the T. maritima enzyme,
the TrxR of P. horikoshii, an anaerobic
thermophilic archaeon, uses both NADH and NADPH, with a preference
for NADH (Kmapp NADH = 26 μM; Kmapp NADPH = 2.7 μM) (Table 1).9,11 Taken
together, the observations presented above suggested that Ta-TrxR,
an enzyme from a facultative anaerobe, might use NADH as electron
donor for Trx reduction.

The above hypothesis is consistent with the structural features
of Ta-TrxR.16 The differences between the
DBMFAD sequences of Ta-TrxR and E. coli NTR were minor16 (Figure 4). The notable one concerned the first residue
of the ATG motif, which was Ala in NTR and Thr in Ta-TrxR. However,
there exist major differences between the DBMNADPH features
of E. coli NTR and Ta-TrxR. The HRR
element of the 2′-phosphate-binding motif (VXXXHRRDXXRA) of E. coli NTR is absent in Ta-TrxR.15 In E. coli NTR, His175,
Arg176, and Arg177 constitute the HRR motif, which is followed by
Asp178 (Figure 4).16,18 In Ta-TrxR, the equivalent residues were Glu185, Tyr186, Met187,
and Pro188, respectively. The change of His175 (E.
coli NTR) to Glu185 (Ta-Trx) could create an unfavorable
interaction of Ta-TrxR with 2′-phosphate of NADPH. Similarly,
the presence of Pro, a nonpolar and structurally constrained residue,
in place of Asp, a polar acidic residue, in the vicinity of the HRR
element (Pro188 in Ta-TrxR vs Asp178 in E. coli NTR), could offer steric hindrance at the NADPH-binding site. In
fact, docking studies with the three-dimensional structure of Ta-TrxR
have shown that although Glu185 could repel 2′-phosphate of
NADPH electrostatically, this unfavorable interaction would be removed
with NADH.15 Additional suggestions along
this line come from a comparative analysis of the DBMNADPH sequences of Ta-TrxR (Figure 4). There are subtle structural differences between E. coli NTR and Ta-TrxR in the vicinity of the HRR
motif. The GXGXXG/A motif of the DBMNADPH of E. coli NTR was found in Ta-TrxR; however, in the
latter, the terminal residue is Tyr and not Ala, and in other NADH-dependent
TrxRs, the respective residue was either Tyr or Phe (Figure 4). This feature further suggested
the use of NADH by Ta-TrxR.

Our biochemical characterizations
of the enzyme showed that Ta-TrxR
indeed used NADH for the reduction of Ta-Trx. The kinetic analysis
of this reaction was impeded by the observation that although a rise
of Ta-Trx concentration from 5 to 10 μM increased the activity
1.6-fold, any further increase in the concentration led to the precipitation
of this substrate. For this reason, for further studies on the kinetic
properties of Ta-TrxR, DTNB was used as the disulfide substrate in
place of Ta-Trx. The Km values for NADH
(3.12 μM) and DTNB (2.93 mM) obtained from these assays were
typical of flavin-containing TrxRs.6,8−10 Thus, the thioredoxin reductase of T. acidophilum is a bona fide NADH-dependent enzyme. This property is fully supported
by the redox potential value of the Ta-TrxR-bound flavin, which was
determined to be −305 mV,21 as it
makes NADH a thermodynamically accessible electron donor for this
enzyme.

The prokaryotic TrxRs that use solely NADH as an electron
donor
thus far have been found in obligate and facultative anaerobic bacteria
and archaea.8−10 However, TrxRs that can use NADH as well as NADPH
have been reported in both anaerobes and aerobes (Table 1). The Deinococcus
radiophilus TrxR is the sole example of such an enzyme
from an aerobic bacterium. However, it shows preference for NADPH.11 Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis suggested
that D. radiophilus obtained the enzyme
through horizontal gene transfer from anaerobic archaea.11 These observations suggest that the NADH-dependent
TrxRs likely originated in anaerobes.

It is not clear why the
anaerobes would prefer NADH to NADPH for
Trx reduction. One of the possible reasons is to achieve energy efficiency.
Generally, anaerobic metabolism generates less ATP than the aerobic
counterparts and the use of NADH avoids investment in the conversion
of NADH to NADPH by NAD kinase, which requires ATP.22 However, the T. acidophilum genome encodes both NAD+/NADH- and NADP+/NADPH-dependent
enzymes, which makes the above-mentioned explanation less likely.

Our findings have shown that the investigations on the electron
donors of yet-to-be characterized flavin-containing Ta-TrxRs that
lack specific structural features for binding of the 2′-phosphate
of NADPH could be guided by their relative phylogenetic positions.
Our phylogenetic studies have also indicated that there exist at least
four more groups of flavin-containing TrxRs that are likely to be
non-NADPH types and need to be investigated for their reductants.

acidophilum genomic DNA and pTev5 were generous gifts
from Dr. Dennis G. Searcy of University of Massachusetts Amherst and
Dr. Jorge Escalante-Semerena of the University of Georgia, respectively.
All chemicals were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,

Heterologous Expression
of TrxR and Trx of T.
acidophilum (Ta-TrxR and Ta-Trx) in E. coli SHuffle T7 Express
Coding sequences
for Ta-TrxR and Ta-Trx were amplified from T. acidophilum genomic DNA using Q5 DNA polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA), and the
respective amplicons were cloned into NdeI and BamHI sites of pTev5, a T7-based expression vector,23 resulting pUL207 and pUL208, respectively. These
plasmids were designed to express recombinant proteins with an NH2-terminal His6-tag, followed by a TEV protease
recognition site. Both plasmids were transformed into E. coli SHuffle T7 Express competent cells (NEB,
Ipswich, MA) containing pRIL plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The
resulting strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani media
containing 100 and 34 μg/mL ampicillin and chloramphenicol,
respectively. For the expression of Ta-Trx, the LB media was supplemented
with DTT at a final concentration of 0.2 mM. When a growing culture
reached an optical density (OD600) of 0.8, as measured
with a DU800 UV–visible spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter,
Inc., Brea, CA), IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM
and the cultivation was continued for additional 5 h at 37 °C
for Ta-TrxR overexpression and for 12 h at 15 °C for Ta-Trx overexpression.
The cells from these cultures were harvested by centrifugation at
10 000g for 10 min at 4 °C using a Sorvall
LYNX 4000 centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and
the cell pellets were stored at −20 °C until used.

Purification
of Recombinant Ta-TrxR and Ta-Trx
This
task was performed under air and as previously described.12 Typically, 4 g of frozen cell pellets of E. coli SHuffle T7 Express harboring pRIL and either
pUL207 or pUL208 were thawed on ice and resuspended in 4 mL of a lysis
buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 300 mM NaCl,
10 mM imidazole, and a cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
tablet (Roche Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). The cells were then
lysed by three passages of the suspension through a French pressure
cell operating at a pressure of 1.28 × 108 Pa, and
the lysate was centrifuged at 18 000g at 4
°C for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to heating
at 80 °C for 10 min to precipitate most of E.
coli proteins, which were then removed by centrifugation
at 18 000g at 4 °C for 30 min. From the
clarified supernatant, recombinant protein was purified via Ni–NTA
chromatography.12 Both Ta-TrxR and Ta-Trx
were eluted at an imidazole concentration range of 100–200
mM. The column fractions that contained homogeneous proteins were
then pooled and concentrated using an Amicon stirred ultrafiltration
cell fitted with a membrane with a desired molecular weight cutoff
(MWCO) (EMD Millipore, Bedford, MA); the MWCO was 10 kDa for Ta-TrxR
and 3 kDa for Ta-Trx. To cleave the NH2-terminal His6-tag, the purified protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C
with recombinant TEV protease carrying a His6-tag (rHis6-TEV)24 at a protein-to-rHis6-TEV ratio of 20:1, following a protocol as described previously.12 From the resulting mixture, Ta-TrxR carrying
intact His6-tag, cleaved His6-tag, and rHis6-TEV were removed by passing through a Ni–NTA column.
The purities of as-purified and digested proteins were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were determined via Bradford
assay using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA)
following the manufacturer’s protocol.25

Insulin Disulfide Reductase Assay for Ta-Trx and Ta-TrxR
Disulfide reductase activity of Ta-Trx was measured by insulin reduction
assay, as described previously, using DTT as an artificial electron
donor.26,27 A standard assay mixture contained 50 μM
Ta-Trx, 0.8 mg/mL insulin, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0), and 1 mM DTT. This assay was also used to test the reactivity
of Ta-TrxR toward Ta-Trx, where it was performed under anaerobic conditions,12 DTT was replaced by NADH (0.1 mM), and Ta-TrxR
was added to a final concentration of 100 nM. The assay temperature
was 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the
reductant, DTT or NADH, and the increase of absorbance at 650 nm indicating
insulin reduction was monitored using a Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer
(Brea, CA).

Kinetic Assays of Ta-TrxR
The assay
was performed anaerobically
at 60 °C as described previously26 using an assay mixture (total volume, 800 μL) that contained
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mM EDTA, and desired
levels of NADH and Ta-Trx or an alternate electron acceptor, such
as 5′-5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) or DTNB. For assays
with Ta-Trx, the concentration of this electron acceptor was maintained
constant by supplementing the assay mixture with oxidized glutathione
to a final concentration of 1 mM.17 In
each case, the reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme,
and in all cases except with DTNB as electron acceptor, it was monitored
at 340 nm for the consumption of NADH; with DTNB, the monitoring was
at 412 nm. The initial velocity values were calculated using an extinction
coefficient value of 6.2 mM–1 cm–1 for NADH at 340 nm or 14.15 mM–1 cm–1 for 5-thio-2-nitrobenzate or TNB at 412 nm.28 For pH studies, the potassium phosphate buffer was replaced by constant
ionic strength buffers composed of 60 mM MES, 120 mM Tris, and 60
mM glacial acetic acid and adjusted to the desired pH values (4–9.5)
with HCl or NaOH.29 To determine the activities
of Ta-TrxR toward alternate substrates, Trx was replaced by one of
the following (entity, (final concentration)): DTNB (varied), Na2SeO3 (50 μM), and oxidized l-glutathione
(1 mM) and lipoate (1 mM). The apparent kinetic constants were calculated
by fitting the initial velocity data to the Henri–Michaelis–Menten
equation, v = Vm [S]/(Km + [S]), where S is the substrate for which
the concentration is varied and Vm and Km are maximum velocity and Michaelis constant,
respectively; KaleidaGraph 4.5 (Synergy Software Inc., Reading, PA)
was used for data fitting.

Bioinformatic Analysis
Primary and
secondary structure
alignments of Ta-TrxR and its close homologues were performed using
MUSCLE30 and PROMALS3D,31 respectively. For the latter, three-dimensional structures
of E. coli NTR and T.
acidophilum TrxR (pdb id: 1CL0 and 3CTY, respectively) served as references.16,18
