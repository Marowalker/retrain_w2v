The
mixed π–π packing of the donor (D) and acceptor
(A) molecules is the highlighting feature of the intermolecular interactions
following charge transfer (CT) issues in organic cocrystal systems.
There is an inverse relationship between the D–A interplanar
distance and the intermolecular CT interaction. However, the D–A
C–C surface close contact (relative areas) on the intermolecular
CT interactions in organic cocrystal systems is rarely investigated.
Herein, we designed and constructed a novel cocrystal and its solvate
cocrystal. The structural and electrostatic potential analyses suggest
that the solvation destroys the N–H···N hydrogen
bond interaction between phenothiazine (PTZ) and 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene
(TCNB), which causes the TCNB molecules to have a 90° rotation
along the normal axis of the PTZ plane. Thus, the D–A C–C
surface close contact is enlarged, strengthening the intermolecular
π–π stacking interactions and intermolecular CT
interaction between PTZ and TCNB, which are further evidenced by the
absorption and Raman spectroscopic analyses. This study provides rare
evidence of the enlarged C–C surface close contact in the mixed
packing between D and A that greatly contributes to the intermolecular
CT interaction in a D–A cocrystal system. It also provides
a deeper understanding of the role of solvation in the structure–property
relationship of organic cocrystal materials.

Introduction
The weak intermolecular
interactions of noncovalent bonds are important
driving forces to assemble the organic cocrystals with two or more
competent molecules and/or ionic compounds,1−4 for instance, π–π
stacking,5−7 halogen bonds,8,9 hydrogen bonds,10,11 and charge transfer (CT).12,13 Methods based on the
tuning of intermolecular interaction for organic cocrystals are advantageous
in regulating the structure, simplifying operation, and reducing cost.14,15 The organic charge transfer cocrystals (OCTCs) are derived from
the ordered assembly and aggregation of donor (D) and acceptor (A)
molecules via the intermolecular CT interactions.1,2 Meanwhile,
the D and A molecules are piled up in the separated (···DDDD···AAAA···)
and alternated (···DADA···DADA···)
stack mode.16−19 The transport of electrons in an OCTC can be enhanced due to the
intermolecular CT interaction,2 which makes
them gain growing attention in the applications of electricity functional
materials20−28 and novel optical materials.29−37

In fact, the intermolecular CT interaction of the cocrystal
is
relevant to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of D molecule
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of A molecule.1,2 Hence, the degree of charge transfer (DCT) is defined as the numbers
of CT from D to A molecules during the process of crystallization.
It depends on the electronic coupling between the HOMO of D and the
LUMO of A, which can be evaluated by calculating the changes of the
bond length.2 It is also reported that
the DCT can be determined by the Raman frequency shift.2 The CT transition of the OCTC can be characterized
by the ultraviolet–visible (Uv–vis) absorption2,38,39 and fluorescence spectroscopies32,40,41 based on the electron transition
from D to A while the D–A crystal absorbs external light radiation.

So far, the intermolecular CT interaction of OCTC is adjusted and
controlled mainly by two methods. One is based on the selection of
chemical components during the synthesis of CT materials. The D and
A molecules are extremely important for tuning the CT interaction
in a cocrystal. When the A molecule is fixed, the DCT can be tuned
by adjusting the HOMO of D.40,42,43 Similarly, the tunable DCT of OCTC can be realized by tuning the
LUMO of A while the D molecule is fixed.30,44 Besides, the DCT of the cocrystal can be adjusted by different stoichiometric
ratios of D and A. For these synthetic methods, the D–A mixed
packing distances will be shortened with the DCT increasing.2 The second method for tuning the intermolecular
CT interaction is the high-pressure method.29,45,46 The D–A interplanar mixed packing
distances become narrower during the compression process, leading
to the enhancement of the intermolecular CT interaction and the red-shifts
of the spectral bands.29,45 In certain cases, the D–A
mixed packing distance is inversely proportional to the intermolecular
CT interaction.2,29,45

Solvent molecules as one of the building components are also
fully
considered into the structures of OCTCs.13,47,48 Hu et al. reported a cocrystal, perylene–TCNB,
and they studied the changes of its structure, color, and dramatic
shape, while the aromatic solvents (tetrahydrofuran, THF) were accommodated.
Owing to the doping of the solvent molecules, the intermolecular D/A
distance was enlarged, causing the CT interaction to decrease.13 Zhang et al. also reported that the assembly
of chlorobenzene into the structure of coronene-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane
can depress the short-contact interactions and enlarge the D/A distance.48 However, the solvation-enhanced intermolecular
CT interaction in an OCTC is rarely reported. Luckily, in the present
work, we observed such a phenomenon in two novel phenothiazine (PTZ)–TCNB
cocrystals. In these two OCTCs (PT and PT-S), PTZ acts as D while
TCNB acts as A, and both of them feature strong near-infrared optical
absorption properties. The role of acetonitrile on the C–C
surface close contact in the mixed D/A packing was disclosed by the
spectroscopic characterization and the experimental data were comparatively
analyzed with theoretical data. The results reveal that the solvent
accommodation not only improved π−π stacking interaction
but also enhanced intermolecular D/A CT interaction, which is different
from previous publications that the weakened CT interactions were
observed once the additional solvents were attended.13,48

Results/Discussion
Crystal Structure and Growth of Cocrystal
PT and PT-S
To determine the effect of solvation on the intermolecular
CT interaction
in the D–A organic cocrystal, we designed and synthesized the
novel cocrystal PT and its solvate cocrystal PT-S. PTZ and TCNB organic
molecules of the PT or PT-S cocrystal are assembled together by the
π–π interaction and CT interaction between the
donor and the acceptor (Scheme 1). Acetonitrile joins in the stacking structure of the PTZ
and TCNB organic molecules as a ratio of 1:1:1 in the PT-S cocrystal
(Scheme 1b).

Scheme 1 Schematic
Representation of Structural Types of PT (a) and PT-S (b)
The single-crystal x-ray diffraction
(SXRD) results show that the
PT belongs to the monoclinic space-group C12/c1 with the cell parameters of a = 16.1392
Å, b = 7.0421 Å, c = 33.352
Å , α = 90°, β = 93.830°, and γ =
90°. The PT-S is assigned to the triclinic space-group p1̅ with the cell parameters of a = 7.3820 Å, b = 8.0065 Å, c = 19.177 Å, α = 83.907°, β = 80.546°,
and γ = 70.64090° (Supporting Information of Table S1). Their π–π packing
arrangements are exhibited in Figure 1A,B. The PTZ and TCNB molecules present an alternate
stacking mode (···D–A–D–A···)
along the b-axis with the centroid–centroid
distance (dc–dc) of 3.8705 and 3.6843 Å for the cocrystal PT (Figure 1A), but along the a-axis with the shorter dc–dc distance of 3.8245, 3.6125, 3.6784, and 3.5446
Å for the cocrystal PT-S (Figure 1B). The growth morphologies of PT and PT-S are computed
by materials studio software54 and shown
in Figure 1C,D. The
cocrystal PT grows along the [010] direction (Figure 1C) and the cocrystal PT-S grows along the
[100] direction (Figure 1D). They keep growing along the ···D–A–D–A···
stacking direction. The optical images of PT and PT-S are shown in Figure 1E,F, PTZ and TCNB
organic molecules are assembled into an ultralong cocrystal wire along
the [010] direction. In the cocrystal PT, the crystal grows along
the [100] direction.

Solvation-Enhanced Intermolecular CT between PTZ and TCNB
The colors of cocrystal PT and PT-S exhibit significant changes
(black) compared to their pristine components (Figure 2A). The color changes indicate that the intermolecular
CT interaction between PTZ and TCNB are generated in this cocrystal.
To assess the intermolecular CT interaction between D and A in the
cocrystal PT and PT-S, the Uv–vis absorption spectra as well
as Raman spectra of PTZ, TCNB, PT, and PT-S crystals were analyzed. Figure 2B shows the Uv–vis
absorption spectra of the PTZ THF solution, the TCNB acetonitrile
solution, and the PT and PT-S solid crystals. The absorption peaks
of the TCNB acetonitrile solution are located at 304 and 317 nm, and
the absorption band of PTZ THF solution is situated in a range of
280–380 nm. When PTZ and TCNB molecules are assembled as a
cocrystal via the CT interaction, absorption edge displays an obvious
red shift and covers the whole wavelength range of Uv–vis–NIR.
The absorption edge of PT-S (∼860 nm) is located at higher
wavenumbers than that of PT (∼800 nm). Our results prove that
the solvent accommodation enhances the intermolecular CT transition
from PTZ to TCNB.29,45

spectra, and (C) Raman
spectra of PTZ, TCNB, PT, and PT-S. (D) Histograms of the four Raman
vibrational wavenumbers of C≡N in TCNB, PT, and PT-S.

The in situ Raman spectra of the
PTZ power, the TCNB power, the
PT solid crystal, and PT-S solid crystal were also investigated at
the 633 nm excitation line (Figure 2C). The Raman vibrational bands of C≡N are located
at 2230–2600 cm–1 in TCNB, PT, and PT-S.
To clearly understand and identify these peaks, we simulated and assigned
the Raman bands of the C≡N in TCNB, PT, and PT-S as shown in Figures S1, S2, and Table S2. Four vibration–rotation
Raman bands of C≡N are observed (peak 1, peak 2, peak 3, and
peak 4) (Figures S1 and S2). In each Raman
band, the four cyano groups of the TCNB molecule show different vibration–rotation
modes and intensities. One of the four cyano groups is attributed
to the strong stretching vibration of C≡N, whereas the other
three belong to the weak stretching or whirling vibrations of C≡N
(Table S2). In the experiment, the four
overlapping C≡N Raman bands of the TCNB power are observed
at 2250, 2242, 2239, and 2239 cm–1, respectively
(Figure 2D). When TCNB
and PTZ form a cocrystal PT, these four bands shift to lower wavenumbers
(2246, 2241, 2237, and 2237 cm–1) (Figure 2D), indicating the formation
of intermolecular CT interaction between the two molecules. Similarly,
when the acetonitrile is accommodated into the structure of the PT-S
cocrystal, four overlapping Raman peaks of C≡N also shift to
the lower wavenumbers (2240, 2237, 2235, and 2235 cm–1) (Figure 2D). The
relatively lower wavenumber shifts of these four bands indicate stronger
intermolecular CT interaction in PT-S than in PT. Based on the structural
analysis, we infer that the enhanced CT interaction may come from
the shorter dc–dc distance (Figure 1A,B).

The DCT of PT-S and PT is calculated as about
0.075e and 0.031e according to the
Mulliken population
analysis, respectively. The theoretical molecular orbitals of the
HOMO and LUMO in PT and PT-S were performed based on the SXRD data. Figure S3A,B exhibit the theoretical molecular
orbitals of the HOMO and LUMO of the two cocrystals. The electron
clouds of the crystal HOMO mainly cover PTZ, whereas the electron
clouds of the crystal LUMO are contributed from TCNB, which certifies
the existence of the CT transition in the PT-S cocrystal. The energy
levels of the HOMO and LUMO in PT and PT-S confirm that the solvation
reduces the bandgap of the cocrystal, strengthening the intermolecular
CT interaction.

Solvation Effect on Intermolecular Hydrogen
Bond Interactions
in Cocrystals
To clarify the mechanism of solvation-enhanced
intermolecular CT between PTZ and TCNB, we analyzed the solvation
effect on intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions in cocrystals.
In PT, PTZ (D) owns a dihedral angle of 157° and exhibits a π–π
stacking structure with TCNB (A) (Figure S4A). A strong N–H···N hydrogen bond with the
bond length of 2.3063 Å between PTZ and TCNB is identifiable
(Figure 3A). The dihedral
angle of PTZ is reduced to 150° in the PT-S (Figure 3B). The N atom from acetonitrile
displays a stronger N–H···N (bond length is
2.257 Å) interaction with PTZ (Figure S4B) rather than TCNB. Interestingly, compared with the structure of
PT, TCNB in PT-S shows the rotation angle of 90° parallel to
the plane of PTZ in the absence of the N–H···N
hydrogen bonds between TCNB and PTZ (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 N–H···N interaction in
the structure of PT
(A) and PT-S (B) and the Hirshfeld surfaces of PT (C) and PT-S (D).

The Hirshfeld surface of the PTZ
molecule in PT and PT-S is mapped
with dnorm(49,50) (Figure 3C,D) using CrystalExplorer
3.1 software,51 where the red color indicates
that the sum of the hydrogen bond d is shorter than the van der Waals
radii, and the blue one is opposite.52,53 In Figure 3C, the red region
on the PTZ surface shows that the N–H bond is connected with
the N atom from the cyano group of TCNB in PT.

In contrast,
in PT-S (Figure 3D),
the acetonitrile molecule presents a stronger N–H···N
interaction with PTZ instead of TCNB. The intermolecular hydrogen
bond interactions in the crystal structures of PT and PT-S are summarized
in Figures S5, S6 and Table S3, respectively.
The major intermolecular interaction between TCNB and its adjacent
PTZ (Figure S5A) is the C–H···N
bond (the N atom is from TCNB and the C–H is from the adjacent
PTZ). The distances of the C–H···N bonds in
PT (2.6613–3.2883 Å) become shorter relative to those
in PT-S (2.6816–3.5544 Å) (Table S3). The C–H···N hydrogen bond interactions also
exist between the adjacent TCNB molecules, and their distance in PT
(2.6320 Å) is shorter than that in PT-S (2.7906 Å). Each
of the adjacent TCNB in PT is packed in the same plane. However, they
are parallel to each other with an interplanar distance of 1.6932
Å in PT-S. Moreover, one acetonitrile is fixed in the lattice
by the C–H···N with the adjacent TCNB, PTZ,
and acetonitrile (Figure S6C and Table S3) in PT-S.

The C–H bonds from acetonitrile are connected
to N from
TCNB with the distance of 2.8751, 3.3952, 3.1741, and 3.1609 Å.
The C–H bonds from PTZ are connected with the N atoms from
acetonitrile with the distance of 3.0972 and 2.9834 Å. Also,
the distance of the C–H···N between every two
adjacent acetonitrile molecules is 2.9396 Å. The analyses of
intermolecular interactions reveal that owing to the introduction
of acetonitrile, the hydrogen-bond quantity increases and the short-contact
distance between D and A is enlarged. In other words, the effect of
solvation decreases the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions
in this CT cocrystal system, which is coincident with the previous
research.13 Next, we carried out the theoretical
simulations of the electrostatic potential (ESP) and their two-dimensional
(2D) fingerprint plots toward the crystal structures relying on CrystalExplorer
3.1 software,51 to quantitatively compare
the intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions in two kinds of cocrystals. Figure 4 shows the ESP of
TCNB molecules mapped on the Hirshfeld surface. Strong negative electrostatic
potential (in red) surrounds the cyano group surface of TCNB (Figure 4A,B).53 The largest negative potential ESP near the
cyano group of TCNB is larger in PT (−0.085 au) than that in
PT-S (−0.057 au). The result demonstrates that the effect of
solvation reduces the electrostatic potential of hydrogen bonds.

Figure 4 Electrostatic
potential of the TCNB molecule is mapped on the Hirshfeld
surface in the PT (A) and PT-S (B), respectively. The fingerprint
plots of N···H and N···N interaction
in PT (C, E) and PT-S (D, F).

The 2D fingerprint plots of PT and PT-S from Figure 4A,B are shown in Figure 4C–F, in which the atom–atom
type contacts are revealed. In both crystal structures, the ESP patterns
are mainly related to the surface contacts of N···H,
N···N, and C···C. The surface contacts
of N···H (43.1%) and N···N (7.3%) can
be identified in PT (Figure 4C,D), which are larger than those in PT-S (the surface contacts
of N···H and N···N are 43 and 3.4%,
respectively) (Figure 4E,F). These results further suggest that the effect of solvation
decreases the short-contact interactions in OCTC.

To further
confirm the above conclusion, we performed the ESP analyses
of PT and PT-S. The sum of surface close contact C···C
in PT (12.2%) displays 1.1%, which is lower than that in PT-S (13.3%),
demonstrating that acetonitrile enhances the π–π
interaction between PTZ and TCNB (Figure 5A,B). Thus, the D/A stacking structure rearrangement
is identified. With the increase of the π–π interaction,
the intermolecular CT transition from PTZ (D) to TCNB (A) can be improved,
and the electron density around the TCNB increases as well, leading
to the lower wavenumber shifts of the Raman bands.

contact in the PT (A) and PT-S (B).

Conclusions
Cocrystal PT and its solvate product PT-S
with the near-infrared
absorption feature were successfully achieved and their intermolecular
charge transfer properties were studied. Compared with the PT, acetonitrile
accommodation changes the structure of the cocrystal, modifies the
type of hydrogen bonds, and increases the distance of the intermolecular
hydrogen bond. As a result, the PT-S shows that the enhanced intermolecular
charge transfer interaction resulted from the largely overlaid π–π
staking between phenothiazine and 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene. The absorption
edge for PT-S is located at 850 nm, which is at a shorter wavelength
(800 nm) for PT. Raman analysis discloses that the C≡N vibrational
peaks of PT-S shift to lower wavenumbers compared to those of PT.
Both experimental data and theoretical analysis results suggest that
the solvation effect leads to enhancement of the intermolecular charge
transfer interaction between phenothiazine and 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene.
This study provides a unique example of the intermolecular charge
transfer interaction that can be enhanced by means of the solvent
accommodation, which is of significance for a deeper understanding
of the organic charge transfer cocrystal functional materials and
provides a reference for the design and preparation of the organic
charge transfer cocrystal.

Experimental and Theoretical Methods
Materials
Phenothiazine (PTZ) (99%) and 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene
(TCNB) were purchased from Sigma Company (98%). Tetrahydrofuran (THF)
and acetonitrile (HPLC, ≥99.9%) were obtained from Aladdin
Company. All of them were directly used without further purification.

Synthesis of Cocrystal PT and Solvate Cocrystal PT-S
2.0
mL of THF was used to dissolve the mixtures of PTZ power (0.0199
g) and TCNB power (0.0178 g) in a glass vial, and then the solvent
was evaporated slowly at room temperature for 1 week. Finally, the
black block cocrystals (PT) were obtained in the solution (Scheme 1a). To achieve the
solvate cocrystal (PT-S) (Scheme 1b), 10 mM of the PTZ THF solution and 10 mM TCNB acetonitrile
solution were first prepared. The PTZ THF solution was mixed rapidly
with the TCNB acetonitrile solution and the mixtures were subjected
to ultrasonic treatment for 2 min. Finally, the mixture solution was
evaporated slowly for 1 week to achieve several bigger black block
solvate cocrystals PT-S.

X-ray Crystal Structure Determination
The single-crystal
x-ray diffraction (SXRD) data of PT and PT-S were collected at 293
K on the R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer (Japan) with the Cu Kα
radiation source (wavelength is 1.542 Å). The two crystal structures
were solved by SHELXT with direct methods. All of the nonhydrogen
atoms were located by SHELXT directly and refined anisotropically
by SHELXL2018 with least squares methods. All of the hydrogens on
N atoms were identified from Q-maps and refined with Uiso(H) = 1.5Uiso(O).
The hydrogens on C atoms were added with the riding model.55 The revised data have been deposited with the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) (accession codes CCDC
1882967 and 1882968). The stacking structure and intermolecular interactions
of the cocrystal were analyzed via diamond software.

Characterization
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectra of PTZ THF solution and TCNB acetonitrile solution
were recorded on a USB4000 Uv–vis spectrometer (Ocean Optics).
The solid UV–vis absorption spectra of PT and PT-S were recorded
using the U-4100 Uv–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi,
Japan). The Raman spectra of PTZ, TCNB, PT, and PT-S were obtained
on a LabRAM Aramis Raman spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped
with a 633 nm excitation line. The optical images of PT and PT-S were
captured by a T64000 Raman confocal microscope system and the distances
were measured by an object micrometer 0.01 mm × 100.

Theoretical
Simulation
Combined with the SXRD crystal
data, the Hirshfeld surfaces, electrostatic potential, and molecular
orbital were simulated by CrystalExplorer 3.1.51 The Hirshfeld surfaces and the electrostatic potential
(ESP) were mapped with dnorm using STO-3G
basis set at the Hartree–Fock theory.52,53 The molecular orbital was computed based on the density functional
theory (DFT), at the 6-31G(d, p) basis set using the CrystalExplorer
3.1. The energy levels of HOMO and LUMO, as well as the Raman spectra
of TCNB, PT, and PT-S, were calculated by DFT, at the B3LYP method
with the 6-31G(d, p) basis set using the Gaussian 09 program package.
The TCNB crystal data come from CCDC no 1268166. The DCT of the cocrystal
was calculated by the Mulliken population analysis. The growth morphologies
of PT and PT-S were simulated by materials studio software.54
