Epitaxial copper
(Cu) films yield graphene with superior quality
but at high cost. We report 1–3 μm thick epitaxial Cu
films prepared on c plane sapphire substrates in
10–30 s, which is much faster than that of the typical sputtering
method. Such rapid deposition is realized by vapor deposition using
a Cu source heated to 1700–1800 °C, which is much higher
than its melting point of 1085 °C. Continuous graphene films,
either bilayer or single-layer, are obtained on the epitaxial Cu by
chemical vapor deposition and transferred to carrier substrates. The
sapphire substrates can be reused five to six times maintaining the
quality of the epitaxial Cu films and graphene. The mechanisms and
requirements are discussed for such quick epitaxy of Cu on reused
sapphire, which will enable high-quality graphene production at lower
cost.

Introduction
Graphene has been applied
in various electric devices because of
its attractive properties such as high carrier mobility, optical transparency,
and flexibility.1,2 The large-area synthesis of graphene
on polycrystalline copper (Cu) foil has been achieved by the chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) method.3 Also, the
roll-to-roll transfer process of graphene from Cu foils to insulating
plastic substrates, aiming for industrialization, has been reported.4,5 Although CVD provides continuous graphene films in arbitrary sizes,
polycrystalline films have numerous domain boundaries and a random
orientation,6−8 which will deteriorate their desirable properties.9 Many works on topics including the electropolishing
and annealing10 of polycrystalline Cu foils,
adjusting the pressure of the carbon source and hydrogen,11 or adjusting annealing conditions12 have been conducted so as to reduce the nucleation
density and increase the domain size of graphene. As a result, millimeter-
or even centimeter-sized graphene domains have been achieved.12−14

Another approach to obtain high-quality graphene films is
the use
of epitaxial Cu(111) films on c plane sapphire substrates.15−24 Graphene domains have the same in-plane orientation due to their
epitaxial growth on the epitaxial Cu(111) surface (although there
is some distribution due to the lattice mismatch of ∼4%18), and can then merge to yield single-crystalline
graphene films with decreased grain boundaries.19,20,25 However, the fabrication of epitaxial Cu
film on c plane sapphire takes ∼10 min by
conventional magnetron sputtering,21 which
typically has a rate of around 50 nm/min.22 It can take an even longer time of several hours in some cases;
800 nm thick Cu films have been deposited by radio-frequency sputtering
with a rate of 0.1 nm/s.23 Furthermore,
lowering the cost of single-crystalline sapphire is still challenging.
Reddy, et al. reported a graphene synthesis using an epitaxial Cu
catalyst on “reusable” basal-plane sapphire substrates
without any data for the “reused” sapphire substrates.24 Koh, et al. reused an epitaxial Ir catalyst
on a sapphire substrate for CVD synthesis and electrochemical transfer
of graphene three times.26 Their method
is excellent for avoiding the time-consuming sputtering process taking
1 h for a 300 nm thick Ir layer in the later cycles but graphene transfer
with catalyst-etching is still more popular due to the suppressed
damage to graphene. Hence, much faster fabrication of epitaxial Cu
films on reusable c plane sapphire substrate is highly
desirable for the low-cost production and wide use of epitaxial graphene
films.

Here, we report the quick preparation of 1–3 μm
thick
epitaxial Cu films on c plane sapphire substrates
within 10–30 s using the rapid vapor deposition (RVD) method
that we previously developed for Si films.27 The deposition rate is ∼100 nm/s, which is 2–3 orders
of magnitude larger than that of sputtering. Such rapid deposition
is realized by heating the Cu source to 1700–1800 °C,
which is much higher than its melting point of 1085 °C, to elevate
its vapor pressure. We also report continuous graphene films, which
are either single-layer or bilayer, on the deposited Cu films by CVD
and the repeated use of the sapphire substrates for such epitaxial
Cu and graphene film production.

Results and Discussion
The deposition of epitaxial films is normally performed under ultrahigh
vacuum, to avoid the disturbance of crystal growth by contamination
gases, with a small deposition rate to allow the deposited atoms to
diffuse sufficiently over the substrate/film surface. Our RVD method
is based on the opposite concept; we deposit Cu at a very high rate
in the presence of “diluted” contaminant gases with
Cu vapor avoiding the need for the ultrahigh vacuum, and heat the
substrate/film to promote the surface diffusion of Cu atoms rapidly
depositing on the substrate/film. The vapor pressure of Cu, p, increases with the source temperature T and reaches p = 432 Pa at T =
2000 K (1727 °C), as shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S1. From the kinetic theory of gases,
the collisional frequency F of Cu to the substrate/film
surface is expressed as 1  where v̅, C, and m are the average velocity, concentration,
and mass of the Cu vapor atom, respectively, M is
the molar mass of Cu, k is the Boltzmann constant,
and R is the gas constant. When Cu has a sticking
probability of η, the Cu deposition rate r is
expressed as 2  where ρ is the mass
density of the solid
Cu. The maximum available Cu deposition rate rmax is calculated using these two equations and η = 1,
and is plotted on the same graph as the the vapor pressure (Figure S1). Equation 2 gives the value rmax = 38 μm/s for T = 2000 K (1727 °C).
The actual deposition rate becomes smaller than this value due to
the dilution of the Cu vapor with increasing distance from the Cu
source, which is roughly 1/400 for a hemispherical Cu droplet with
2 mm radius and a source–substrate distance of 40 mm. Thus,
a deposition rate of r = 0.1 μm/s is expected
for the source temperature of T = 2000 K (1727 °C).

The high vapor pressure of Cu from the hot Cu source is beneficial
not only for an enhanced deposition rate but also for the loose requirement
of base pressure. If the deposition rate is enhanced by 100 times
or more, Cu atoms hit the substrate/film surface 100 times or more
frequently than that of the normal deposition case, diluting the effect
of the contamination gases. Actually, the Cu films grow epitaxially,
as explained later, with a moderate vacuum level; the base pressure
and the pressure during RVD are 1–5 × 10–4 and 1 × 10–3 Pa, respectively. However, to
achieve epitaxial growth, the surface diffusion of Cu atoms on the
substrate/film needs to be enhanced by elevating the substrate temperature.
The Cu films as-deposited by RVD on the c plane sapphire
substrates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Cu Kα
line (Figure S2). The Cu(200) peak is evident
in addition to the intense epitaxial Cu(111) peak in the Cu film deposited
at 200 °C whereas the Cu(200) peak is absent for the Cu films
deposited at 300 and 400 °C. Therefore, we fixed the substrate
temperature at 400 °C hereafter.

Next, we compared the
structures of the Cu films deposited by RVD
on c plane sapphire and the SiO2/Si substrate
at 400 °C. The Cu film deposited on the SiO2/Si substrate
displayed a shiny surface in its optical image (Figure 1a), in which the reflected image of the camera
lens is visible. However, the Cu film showed a cloudy surface when
observed at a tilt angle (Figure 1a′). Cu formed a continuous film with grains
of around 10–30 μm visible in the top-view scanning electron
microscope (SEM) image (Figure 1b). The Cu film deposited in 30 s by RVD had a thickness as
large as 3 μm, and had a flat surface with grain boundaries
(indicated by a white arrow) visible from the side-view SEM image
(Figure 1c). On the
other hand, the Cu film deposited on the sapphire substrate displayed
a much shinier surface than that of SiO2/Si in its optical
image (Figure 1d),
even at a tilt angle (Figure 1d′), and a much flatter surface without any grain boundaries,
as shown by SEM (Figure 1e,f).

Figure 1 As-deposited Cu films by RVD on SiO2/Si (a–c)
and c plane sapphire (d–f); substrates and
the films after annealing (g–i and j–l). The Cu films
(∼3 μm in thickness) were deposited on substrates by
RVD at 400 °C for 30 s and then annealed under 100 vol % H2 at 1050 °C and 760 Torr for 30 min. (a, a′, d,
d′, g, j) Optical images, (b, e, h, k) top-view SEM images,

(a, d, j) Photos were taken perpendicular to the Cu surface and the

Photos taken with a tilt angle of the Cu films prepared under the
same conditions as (a, d), respectively, in different batches.

Then we annealed both substrates
under pure H2 at 1050
°C for 30 min. The Cu film on the SiO2/Si substrate
became discontinuous, showing the color of both the substrate and
Cu film (Figure 1g).
The Cu film dewetted and formed hemispherical particles (Figure 1h,i), accompanying
a mass decrease of 86 μg/cm2 (3.4% of the original
mass of the Cu film, calculated from the mass change of the sample
before and after annealing), due to sublimation of Cu during annealing.
The Cu films on the sapphire substrate retained a continuous and flat
film (Figure 1j–l),
accompanying much less Cu sublimation of 28 μg/cm2 (0.84%). The different mass change can be explained by the Kelvin
effect; the Cu particles have a curved surface and a higher vapor
pressure, thus more Cu evaporated from the Cu particles on SiO2/Si than the flat Cu film on sapphire.

The as-deposited
Cu films on both substrates were analyzed by XRD
using a Cu Kα line (Figure 2). The Cu on SiO2/Si was face-centered cubic-Cu
(fcc-Cu) and showed a preferred orientation of (111) with a minor
peak of (200) in the out-of-plane measurement (Figure 2a), whereas it showed only a weak (220) peak
in the in-plane measurement (Figure 2b). The Cu film showed signals without any symmetry
of rotation for the (220) diffraction in the phi-scan measurement
(Figure 2c). These
results show that Cu on SiO2/Si is polycrystalline fcc-Cu.
On the other hand, the Cu on c plane sapphire showed
an intense peak of (111) in the out-of-plane measurement (Figure 2d) and an intense
(220) peak in the in-plane measurement (Figure 2e). Note that the (111) and (220) planes
are perpendicular to each other. The Cu film on the sapphire substrate
showed six-fold symmetry for the (220) diffraction in the phi-scan
measurement (Figure 2f). These results show that fcc-Cu forms epitaxially on sapphire.
The six-fold symmetry instead of three-fold symmetry shows the twinned
structure of the epitaxial Cu.28 There
are some minor peaks in the XRD patterns, all of which can be assigned
to the fcc-Cu (111) peak of the Cu Kβ line or the peaks from
sapphire and Cu2O. Although the Cu source was heated to
a very high temperature of 1700–1800 °C, no other elements
such as W (evaporation boat) were detected in the Cu films by SEM-energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) other than Cu and C- and O-contaminations
(Figure S3). The full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of the Cu(111) peak in the out-of-plane measurement was 0.26
and 0.19° for the Cu film on SiO2/Si (Figure 2a) and sapphire (Figure 2d), respectively. The FWHM
value of 0.19° of this work is significantly smaller than the
value of 0.25° reported by Lee et al.23 for the 800 nm thick epitaxial Cu film deposited slowly at 0.1 nm/s
on sapphire at 150 °C by radio-frequency sputtering with a base
pressure of <1 × 10–3 Pa. The FWHM value
was not found in any other reports on epitaxial Cu catalysts on sapphire.15−22,24 The
small FWHM value shows the good quality of our epitaxial Cu films
deposited by RVD quickly at ∼100 nm/s, possibly due to the
absence of plasma damage and/or the dilution of the background gases
with the high-pressure Cu vapor.

We then synthesized graphene on
the epitaxial Cu film on the fresh
sapphire substrate (Figure 3). First, CVD was performed in one step with a low ratio of
CH4/H2 (55 mTorr CH4/37 Torr H2/39 Torr Ar) at a high temperature (1050 °C). 30–50
μm sized graphene islands were observed with interspacings of
a few hundred μm, many of which were oriented in the same direction.
Such alignment for an area over 1 mm2 is due to the van
der Waals epitaxy of graphene on the single-crystalline Cu film. However,
some islands are not oriented, and possibly nucleated from some impurity
site.

Figure 3 SEM image of graphene synthesized on the epitaxial Cu film (thickness
∼3 μm) on the fresh sapphire substrate by one-step CVD
with 55 mTorr CH4/37 Torr H2 /39 Torr Ar at
1050 °C for 20 min. Red lines are drawn in the same direction
as the oriented graphene islands. Blue lines are drawn for the disoriented
islands.

Next, to obtain the continuous
graphene films more quickly, CVD
was performed in two steps; the first step was carried out with a
high CH4/H2 ratio to promote nucleation of graphene
islands for 1 min, and the second step was carried out with a low
CH4/H2 ratio to grow graphene islands without
additional nucleation for the successive 4–19 min. At the initial
stage of 1 + 4 min, 10–20 μm sized graphene islands formed
(Figure 4a,b). The
typical Raman spectrum of the graphene islands showed a 2D/G peak
intensity ratio of I2D/IG ≈ 1, confirming that the graphene islands were
mostly in bilayer form, and a rather large D/G peak intensity ratio
of ID/IG =
0.33, showing some effect of the island edges (Figures 4e and S4). The
Raman spectra showed similar patterns at most of the other points
(Figure S5a), showing the uniform formation
of the bilayer islands. We can also observe small multilayer regions
(a few μm) near the center of the bilayer islands (inset of Figure 4a, Figure S4). At the later stage of 1 + 19 min, graphene fully
covered the Cu surface (Figure 4c,d). The typical Raman spectrum of the continuous graphene
had an I2D/IG ≈ 1, showing that the graphene islands were mostly in bilayer
form, and a significantly smaller ID/IG (0.05) than that of the 1 + 4 min sample (Figure 4e). The reduced ID/IG ratio is possibly
due to the carefully grown graphene at a low CH4/H2 ratio in the second step and the reduced effect of the island
edges. The Raman spectra showed a similar pattern at most of the other
points (Figure S5b). We also observed small
multilayer regions (Figure 4d) that
are similar in size (a few μm) than those in the 1 + 4 min sample
(inset of Figure 4a).
The coverage (area ratio) of the multilayer regions was evaluated
by Image J software and was found to be 2.5% in the continuous graphene
film (Figure 4d). For
the six samples synthesized with CVD times between 1 + 4 and 1 + 89
min, five samples were mostly bilayer (Figure S5a,b) and only one sample was mostly single-layer (Figure S5c). The continuous film of mostly single-layer
graphene, transferred to a quartz glass substrate, had an optical
transmittance of 97.7% at 550 nm in the UV–visible (vis) spectrum
(Figure S5d). These results show that the
first 1 min nucleation step with a high CH4/H2 ratio promoted nucleation of bilayer graphene possibly due to fast
carbon deposition. Once the bilayer islands nucleate, the first and
second layers grow at a similar rate in the successive second step
with a low CH4/H2 ratio, resulting in uniform
bilayer graphene (Figure 4f). However, the multilayer islands, which nucleate possibly
at some impurity site of the epitaxial Cu film, grow slowly. The single-layer
or bilayer graphene may cover the multilayer sites and prevent the
growth of multilayer islands.

(thickness ∼3
μm) on the fresh sapphire substrate by two-step CVD. After annealing
under 100 vol % H2 at 1050 °C and 760 Torr for 30
min, the first-step CVD was carried out with 83 mTorr CH4/15 Torr H2/61 Torr Ar at 1000 °C for 1 min and the
second-step CVD was successively carried out with 83 mTorr CH4/20 Torr H2/56 Torr Ar at 1000 °C for 4 or
19 min. (a, c) Top-view SEM images of the as-synthesized graphene

spectra with excitation at 488 nm of the graphene transferred to the
SiO2/Si substrates. (f) Structure model for graphene. Data
were taken from the center of the substrates.

Next, we tried to reuse the sapphire substrates for only
the Cu
epitaxy process (without graphene growth). We deposited Cu on a sapphire
substrate by RVD, performed H2 annealing with or without
1 min of CVD. Skipping the graphene growth and transfer steps, we
treated the substrate with an FeCl3 solution to remove
the Cu (and graphene), annealed the substrate under O2,
treated the substrate with a H2O2–H2SO4 mixed solution, and repeated these steps multiple
times. The optical images in Figure 5a show that Cu was deposited epitaxially on the same
sapphire substrate five times. At the sixth and seventh cycles, the
central region remained shiny whereas the outer region became foggy
(Figure 5b,c). In the
SEM images, the central region had a smooth surface (Figure 5d), similar to the epitaxial
Cu film on fresh sapphire (Figure 1e), whereas the outer region showed boundary patterns
at the sixth cycle, similar to the nonepitaxial Cu film on the SiO2/Si substrate (Figure 1b). Figure 5f shows the mass decrease of the Cu films through H2-annealing
(with or without 1 min of CVD), and Ra and Rrms (Rq) roughness of the as-deposited Cu films measured by atomic force
microscopy (AFM) at the different cycles. The mass decrease of the
Cu film was small for the first to fifth cycles, and increased to
a similar value to the polycrystalline Cu film on the SiO2/Si substrate at the sixth and seventh cycles. The same change was
also observed for the surface roughness of the Cu films. The larger
mass decrease and roughening of the surface are caused by nonepitaxial
Cu growth at the outer region of the repeatedly used sapphire substrate.
We therefore conclude that the sapphire substrates can be reused for
Cu epitaxy up to five times, and maybe more with appropriate treatment
of the sapphire surface.

images of Cu films deposited on the reused sapphire substrate at different
cycles with Cu deposited on SiO2/Si as a reference. (d,

Roughness was evaluated using the AFM images taken over a 10 ×

first to sixth cycles and at the nonepitaxial part a few mm apart
from the center for the seventh cycle.

Figure 6 shows
the
AFM images of the Cu films deposited on the reused sapphire substrate.
As explained above (Figure 5), the Cu film had a smooth surface when deposited during
the early cycles (Figure 6a) whereas it had a rough surface during the later cycles
(Figure 6b). The H2 annealing had a significant effect on the surface structure
of the Cu films (Figure 6c,d); their surface roughness decreased significantly (note the different
height scale bars) and clear steps with six-fold symmetry appeared.
The quality of epitaxy degraded during the later cycles but could
be recovered to a certain extent by the H2 annealing.

sixth (b, d) cycles on the reused sapphire substrate. Images were
taken at the center of each sample. The upper and lower height scale
bars apply for the images before (a, b) and after (c, d) annealing,
respectively. The white lines show the direction of the steps.

Next, we examined the reuse of
another sapphire substrate in the
whole process including graphene growth and transfer to the SiO2/Si substrate. In this set of repeated cycles, epitaxial Cu
film was obtained on the sapphire substrate six times, as confirmed
by the out-of-plane, in-plane, and phi-scan XRD measurements (Figure S6a–c) and a continuous graphene
film (1.8 × 1.8 cm2) was obtained on a SiO2/Si substrate by poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-assisted transfer
(Figure S6d). The SEM and OM images (Figure 7a,b) show that the
graphene synthesized and transferred to the SiO2/Si substrate
at the third cycle was fairly uniform, and the Raman mapping of I2D/IG ratio (Figure 7c) shows that the
graphene was mostly of bilayer form. The bilayer graphene was Bernal-stacked
because its 2D peak was fitted with four Lorentzian peaks (Figure S7).29,30 The reused
sapphire substrate yielded continuous graphene films of mixed single-layer
and bilayer graphene for the first to seventh cycles (Figure 7d). The graphene films retained
their quality in terms of ID/IG ratio (<0.1) and sheet resistance (1.2–1.3
kΩ/sq without doping) for the first to seventh cycles (Figure 7e). However, at the
seventh cycle, the Cu film did not grow epitaxially on the reused
sapphire substrate, resulting in a graphene film with a degraded quality.

substrate. (a) SEM image, (b) OM image, and (c) Raman mapping of I2D/IG ratio of a
graphene continuous film synthesized using the three times reused
sapphire substrate and transferred to a SiO2/Si substrate.
(d, e) Raman spectra, ID/IG ratio (red circles), and sheet resistance (blue triangles)
of the graphene synthesized by reusing the sapphire substrate and

sheet resistance were measured at 10 and 5 random positions, respectively,
a few millimeters apart for each sample. Intensity was normalized
to the G-band in (d). The small open symbols and big solid symbols
show the raw and average values, respectively in (e).

Finally, we analyzed the surface of the sapphire
substrate that
was reused eight times. Micro X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (μ-XPS)
showed Si peaks on both the central region where Cu grows epitaxially
(Figure 8a) and the
outer region where Cu no longer grows epitaxially (Figure 8d). SEM and AFM images showed
larger particles in higher density at the outer region (Figure 8e,f) than those in the central
region (Figure 8b,c).
Further, SEM-EDS elemental analysis showed a higher surface content
of Si at the outer region (0.27 wt %, Figure 8e) than that at the central region (0.06
wt %, Figure 8b) (EDS
acceleration voltage of 10 kV). The particles are probably Si or SiOx coming from the reactor tube, accumulating
with increasing cycles, and finally inhibiting the epitaxial growth
of Cu during RVD. We are now working on the prevention of this contamination
and/or effective removal of the particles to reuse sapphire substrates
for increased numbers of cycles.

Conclusions
1–3 μm thick epitaxial Cu films
were obtained in 10–30
s on a c plane sapphire substrate by RVD with a Cu
source heated to temperatures (1700–1800 °C) that are
much higher than its melting point (1085 °C). The deposition
is 2–3 orders of magnitude faster than the speed of the conventional
sputtering method and the resulting epitaxial Cu films had a twinned
structure. Low-pressure CVD using CH4/H2 yielded
continuous graphene films of either bilayer or single-layer form on
the epitaxial Cu films. After transferring the graphene to SiO2/Si substrates, the sapphire substrates were annealed in O2, treated with acid, and reused for Cu epitaxy and CVD of
graphene. Epitaxial Cu films of small surface roughness were repeatedly
obtained after 5–6 cycles, yielding graphene of consistent
quality (ID/IG < 0.1, sheet resistance of 1.2–1.3 kΩ/sq without
doping). The sapphire substrate acquired Si or SiOx particles, especially at the outer regions, which possibly
inhibited the Cu epitaxy during later cycles. Prevention and/or removal
of the particles will enable the reuse of sapphire substrates for
increased numbers of cycles.

Methods
Preparation of Cu Films
on Substrates by RVD
c Plane sapphire (Kyocera,
Kyoto, Japan) or SiO2 (50 nm)/Si substrates (2 × 2
cm2) were pre-treated
by dipping into H2O2/H2SO4 = 1/3 solution for 5 min and rinsing in deionized water. The substrate
was dried by N2-gas blow, set on a quartz glass stage in
a vacuum chamber with the substrate surface facing down, and evacuated
to 1–5 × 10–4 Pa by a turbo-molecular
pump. Then, a 1–3 μm thick Cu film was deposited on the
substrate (heated at 400 °C) by RVD for 10–30 s, by heating
of Cu wire (99.9%, 1 mm φ, 20 mm in length, Nilaco; Tokyo, Japan)
to 1700–1800 °C using a tungsten boat. During RVD, the
pressure in the chamber increased to ∼1 × 10–3 Pa due to gas emission from the hot Cu source. The deposited Cu
films were analyzed by SEM (Hitachi S-4800; Tokyo, Japan) equipped
with EDS (Genesis; AMETEK EDAX, Berwyn, PA), XRD (RINT-Ultima III;
Rigaku, Akishima, Japan), and AFM (SPM-9600; SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan).

Graphene Growth by CVD
Graphene was grown by a two-step
CVD.31 The Cu/sapphire substrate was loaded
in a thermal CVD apparatus consisting of a quartz tube (inner diameter
of 34 mm), a furnace (heating zone of 300 mm), and a U-turn gas supply,32 and heated at a ramping rate of ∼1 °C/s
to 1050 °C and held for 30 min under a 760 Torr H2 flow at 50 sccm. The reactor was then cooled to 1000 °C at
a cooling rate of ∼1 °C/s. The graphene growth process
was initiated by switching the gas to 83 mTorr CH4/15 Torr
H2/61 Torr Ar with a total flow rate of 460 sccm. After
1 min, the gas was switched to 83 mTorr CH4/20 Torr H2/56 Torr Ar with a total flow rate of 460 sccm and kept for
4–89 min. After the growth step, the reactor was rapidly cooled
to room temperature at a cooling rate of ∼10 °C/s.

Transfer
of Graphene to the SiO2/Si Substrate
Onto the
graphene/Cu/sapphire sample, 4 wt % PMMA in ethyl lactate
solution (100 μL) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 1 min, followed
by baking at 180 °C for 30 min on a hot plate.33 The thickness of PMMA was approximately 500 nm. Cu was
etched by 1 M FeCl3 solution (30 mL), and the obtained
PMMA/graphene film floating on the solution surface was collected
by a SiO2 (90 nm)/Si or quartz substrate and put into deionized
water to be washed. After drying on a hot plate at 80 °C for
30 min, PMMA was removed in acetone (50 mL), and graphene/SiO2/Si was obtained. The transferred graphene was observed by
SEM, UV–vis spectroscopy (V-630; JASCO, Hachioji, Japan), and
Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA HR-800; Kyoto, Japan) with an excitation
laser wavelength of 488 nm. The 2D peak (∼2700 cm–1) in the Raman spectra was analyzed using PeakFit software (HULINKS
Inc., Tokyo, Japan).

Treatment and Characterization of the Sapphire
Substrate for
Reuse
The sapphire substrate after the transfer process was
cleaned for reuse; it was annealed in 30 Torr O2/730 Torr
Ar with a total flow rate of 500 sccm at 850 °C for ∼30
min and then treated by dipping into H2O2/H2SO4 = 1/3 solution for 5 min. Then, the treated
sapphire substrate underwent the next cycle, starting with Cu-RVD.
The surface of the Cu films on the reused sapphire substrate was analyzed
by SEM and AFM before/after H2-annealing. The surface of
the reused sapphire substrate after O2-annealing and acid
treatment was analyzed by SEM-EDS, AFM, and μ-XPS (PHI-5000
VersaProbe II; ULVAC-PHI, Chigasaki, Japan). The sheet resistance
of the resulting graphene films was measured by the four-point-probe
method after transferring them to the SiO2/Si substrate.
