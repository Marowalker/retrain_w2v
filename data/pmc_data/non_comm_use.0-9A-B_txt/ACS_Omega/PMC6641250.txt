Introduction
In recent years, developing
green and sustainable chemical procedures
to achieve the targets have attracted the attention of more and more
chemists. Many great achievements of “green and sustainable
chemistry” have been made, such as metal-free catalysis1−5 and catalyst-free synthesis.6−11 For the past few years, exploring green and sustainable methodologies
for constructing the C–S bond have emerged as a significant
field of research in organic synthesis12,13 and medical
chemistry.14−18 Diarylmethyl sulfones as one of the most important sulfur-containing
compounds, which are often valuable intermediates in organic transformations19−21 such as construction of triarylmethane derivatives, are widely present
in medicinal chemistry and materials science.22−24

Recently,
several methods for their preparation have been reported,
such as the oxidation of corresponding sulfides (Figure 1(i))25 and copper-catalyzed nitrogen loss of sulfonylhydrazones (Figure 1(ii)).26 In the past few years, transition metal-catalyzed
arylation of 1 with aryl halide via nucleophilic substitution
reaction to construct diarylmethyl sulfones has been well-documented
(Figure 1(iii)).21,27−30 For example, in 2014, Nambo et al.21 reported
a Pd-catalyzed C–H arylation of monoarylated sulfones with
iodoarenes to provide diarylmethyl sulfones. Unfortunately, heteroaromatic
substrates were not well-tolerated by the arylation reaction and formed
products with lower yields (30–42%). In addition, to obtain
the diarylmethyl sulfones, [{PdCl(allyl)}2] (5 mol %),
P(tBu)3·HBF4 (20 mol %),
and KOtBu (3.0 equiv) and a high temperature were
required. The common points of the aforementioned transition metal-catalyzed
methods, high acidity of the benzylic proton and strong base, are
often required.21,27−30 To the best of our knowledge,
phenylsulfinate ion (PhSO2–) presents
two tautomers, sulfone and sulfinate, and therefore has the selective
of the O-attack or S-attack of carbocations to provide sulfones (Ar2CH–SO2Ph) or esters (Ar2CH–OS(O)Ph).31 Notably, most of the methods described above
often suffer from the common limitations of using toxic and odorous
reagents, hazardous and costly catalysts, rigorous reaction conditions,
poor selectivity, limited substrates, and low functional group compatibility.
To address these limitations, developing efficient, green, and sustainable
strategies to construct diarylmethyl sulfones remains important and
is challenging. In continuation of our interest in constructing functionalized
molecules,32−36 herein, we report a catalyst-free, facile, and efficient route for
the synthesis of diarylmethyl sulfones from the readily available
starting materials, sulfonyl hydrazides9,37 and p-quinone methides (p-QMs),38−53 which are widely used in modern organic synthesis because of the
assembly of carbonyl and olefinic moieties (Figure 1b).

methods and (b)
our strategy.

Results and Discussion
We commenced our study by selecting p-QM 2a and sulfonyl hydrazide 3a as model substrates
and ethanol as the solvent to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 1). Pleasingly, the
reaction smoothly occurred in the numerous organic acidic catalysts
or organic basic catalysts, offering the desirable product 4aa in 15–80% yield (Table 1, entries 1–10). Furthermore, better results
were observed in the organic basic catalysts. By contrast, only a
trace of the product was observed in the presence of the inorganic
bases (Table 1, entries
11–12). On the basis of the aforementioned results, we envisioned
whether the reaction could occur in neutral catalysts. To our delight,
the reaction could work well without any catalyst, obtaining 4aa with a satisfactory yield. Notably, the yield of 4aa was remarkably increased when the mixed solvents (EtOH/H2O, 3:1, v/v) were applied (Table 1, entries 14–22). The result revealed
that water played an important role in the reaction, although the
substrates have poor solubility in water. Furthermore, the higher
or lower temperature was obviously adverse to the reaction (Table 1, entries 23–24).
Thus, the optimum conditions were achieved by employing 2a (0.1 mmol) and 3a (0.11 mmol) in EtOH/H2O (3:1, v/v) under 50 °C for 8 h (Table 1, entry 22). Notably, high chem- and regioselectivities
were observed, and the corresponding ester, 1,2- or 1,4-addition product
was not detected in any case.

With the optimal reaction conditions in hand, the
scope of the
1,6-conjugate addition/aromatization/sulfonylation reaction of p-QMs to sulfonyl hydrazides was investigated.

First,
a set of sulfonyl hydrazides 3 were tested
by keeping p-QM 2a constant. For sulfonyl
hydrazides 3, the substituents on the aromatic ring,
whether with electron-donating groups [Me, OMe, 2,4,6-(Me)3, and Ph] or electron-withdrawing groups (F, Cl, Br, NO2, and CF3), afforded the corresponding diarylmethyl sulfones
with excellent yields 80–96% (Table 2, entries 1–10). Notably, the sterically
hindered mesitylenesulfonohydrazide was also well-tolerated by the
conjugate addition reaction to give product 4ad in 80%
yield (Table 2, entry
4), however, the substrate could not participate in the sulfonylation
reaction in Patil’s report.54 Subsequently,
α-naphthylsulfonyl hydrazide and β-naphthylsulfonyl hydrazide
were tested, and the desired products 4ak–4al were
obtained in 94 and 91% yields, respectively (Table 2, entries 11–12). More importantly,
thienylsulfonyl hydrazide and aliphaticsulfonyl hydrazides also worked
satisfactorily under the optimal reaction conditions to give the corresponding
targets in 88–90% yields (Table 2, entries 13–16). It is interesting to observe
that (−)-10-camphorsulfonyl hydrazide also survived, and in
this transformation, product 4aq was obtained in 85%
yield with 1.3:1 diastereoselectivity (Table 2, entry 17).

Next,
we investigated the utility of p-QMs for
the reaction under the standard reaction conditions. As shown in Table 3, various stable p-QMs with electron-rich and electron-deficient substituents
at the ortho, meta, and para positions of the aryls were compatible
with the reaction, providing the desired products with excellent yields
and high chem- and regioselectivities (Table 3, entries 1–13). Furthermore, α-naphthyl-substituted p-QM was well-tolerated by the transformation to give product 4bn in 91% yield (Table 3, entry 14). Notably, heteroaromatic-substituted p-QMs underwent the 1,6-conjugate addition reaction with
sulfonyl hydrazide 3a smoothly, giving the desired diarylmethyl
sulfones in 85–90% yield (Table 3, entries 15–16).

To further demonstrate the potential
utility of our strategy, we
selected phenylsulfonyl hydrazide 3a and n-butylsulfonyl hydrazide 3p as the sulfonyl precursors
to react with p-QM 2a as the two representative
examples to be scaled up (5.0 mmol 2a). To our delight,
the yield of the corresponding products remained reasonable with 88%
(4aa) and 86% (4ap) yields, respectively
(Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Two Representative
Examples to be Scaled Up
The chemical structures of diarylmethyl sulfones 4 were fully characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C
NMR), and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectroscopies.
To further verify the structure of the targets, 4aa was
selected as a representative compound and unequivocally confirmed
by X-ray diffraction analysis, as shown in Figure 2 (CCDC 1583037).

Figure 2 Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid
plot diagram of 4aa; ellipsoids
are drawn at the 30% probability level.

Furthermore, several controlled experiments were conducted
to get
a deep insight into the mechanism of the sulfonylation process. Initially,
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy as the radical scavenger was
employed to elucidate whether the reaction involves radical species
under standard reaction conditions. The radical trapping experiments
revealed that the transformation did not proceed via a free-radical
pathway, affording 4aa in 65% yield (Scheme 2, a). Subsequently, to clarify
the source of hydrogen in the phenolic hydroxyl group of the product,
EtOD/D2O and toluene/D2O were used as the reaction
media under standard conditions, respectively (Scheme 2, b and c). Interestingly, we did not detect
the deuterated product, and the result indicated that the origin of
hydrogen of phenolic hydroxyl was not derived from H2O
and EtOH. Thus, we speculated that hydrogen may be derived from benzenesulfonyl
hydrazide itself.

Scheme 2 Mechanistic Investigations of the Sulfonylation Process
Toluene
was strictly distilled
with sodium.

On the basis of the aforementioned
results and previous reports,9,37,55,56 it is reasonable to speculate
a possible reaction pathway, which
is depicted in Scheme 3. First, sulfonylhydrazide 3a is quickly transformed
into sulfinyl anion 6, which can resonate with sulfur-centered
anion 7 in the presence of water, generating hydronium
ions and releasing N2. Then, sulfur-centered anion 7 is selectively added to p-QM 2a via the 1,6-conjugate addition reaction to form intermediate 8. Finally, the target product 4aa was obtained
by proton transfer from hydronium ions and aromatization reaction.

Scheme 3 Mechanism Hypotheses for the Synthesis of Target Compounds 4aa
Conclusions
In
summary, we report a catalyst-free 1,6-conjugate addition/aromatization/sulfonylation
reaction of p-QMs, a facile and efficient route to
synthesis diarylmethyl sulfones. The established protocol provided
a concise, rapid, and environmentally friendly vision to prepare a
diverse array of diarylmethyl sulfones. The reaction has attractive
features, including mild conditions, environmentally friendly, high
chemo- and regioselectivities, broad scope of substrates, excellent
yields, and scalability. The controlled experiments indicated that
hydrogen of phenolic hydroxyl may be derived from benzenesulfonyl
hydrazide. The mechanistic details and the potential utility of diarylmethyl
sulfones in organic synthesis are currently underway.

Experimental
Section
General Methods
All received reagents and solvents
were used without further purification, unless otherwise stated. Melting
points were determined on a XT-4A melting point apparatus and are
uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 (1H: 400 MHz, 13C: 100 MHz) with CDCl3 as the
solvent. The chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per
million relative to the residual deuterated solvent signal, and coupling
constants (J) are given in hertz. HRMS (electrospray
ionization) was performed on an Agilent LC/MSD TOF instrument.

All chemicals and solvents were used as received without further
purification, unless otherwise noted. Column chromatography was performed
on silica gel (200–300 mesh). p-QMs 2 and sulfonyl hydrazides 3 were prepared according
to a procedure described in the literature.9,37−39,41 The structure of diarylmethyl
sulfones 4 were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS spectra.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Compounds 4
A 10 mL round-bottom
flask was charged with p-QMs 2 (0.1
mmol), sulfonyl hydrazides 3 (0.11 mmol), EtOH/H2O (1.5–0.5 mL, v/v), and the
solution was stirred for 2–24 h under 50 °C until p-QMs 2 were completely consumed, as indicated
by thin-layer chromatography. Then, the crude products were purified
by flash silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether/EtOAc = 10:1–6:1),
which afforded the pure product 4 in 80–95% yields.
