An indium-mediated
isomerization of 1,4-dienols to 1,3-dienols
is described. This procedure consists of the addition of pentadienylindium,
in a protic solvent, to aldehydes giving the kinetic γ-allylation
product in high yields. The subsequent conversion of this γ-allylation
product to its thermodynamic 1,3-dienol α-isomer can be achieved
by its exposure to indium triflate in the presence of a substoichiometric
amount of aldehyde at room temperature. This transformation exhibited
moderate to good substrate scope and has been shown to proceed by
a 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement.

Introduction
1,4-Dienol motifs (1) are a valuable and sought after
precursors in organic synthesis because of their unique functional
connectivity. 1,4-Dienols 1 can undergo elimination reactions
to give trienes such as 2 that have been shown to be
excellent Diels–Alder platforms (Scheme 1), therefore enabling significant molecular
complexity to be built up quickly in very few synthetic transformations.1 The connectivity of 1,4-dienols (1) has been harnessed in ruthenium-catalyzed RCM transformation delivering
unique cyclic and polycyclic structures.2 Furthermore, 1,4-dienol 1 can undergo facile isomerization
to the thermodynamically favored α-allylic alcohol product 3 (1,3-dienol) that is central to numerous natural products
of biological importance as well as useful synthetic intermediates
(Scheme 1).3

Scheme 1 Synthetic Utility of 1,4-Dienols and Their
Conversion to 1,3-Dienols
The resolvin D- and E-series (Scheme 2, e.g., resolving D1 and resolving E1) are
a class of metabolites derived from ω-3 fatty acids, docosahexaenoic
acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid. They have been implicated in the
regulation of human diseases linked to chronic inflammation such as
cardiovascular diseases, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis.4a−4c In a project looking at the biological importance of these fatty
acids metabolites,4d we required access
to a range of racemic 1,3-dienols with aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl
substitution that mirrored that within the resolvin D1 and E1 structures
(Scheme 2, 4–6). We envisaged that 1,3-dienols of this type could be accessed via
a 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement of a 1,4-dienol, which in turn could
be accessed from an appropriate aldehyde (9) and a pentadienyl
equivalent (Scheme 2). This approach was based on two benchmarks (a) the ability to easily
synthesize the 1,4-dienol precursors and (b) literature precedent
for the thermodynamic rearrangement to the required 1,3-dienols.

Scheme 2 Targeted 1,3-Dienols Using a 2-Oxonia Cope Rearrangement
First, in the literature, there
are several robust synthetic methods
for the synthesis of 1,4-dienol precursors (10), all
of which are based on the addition of a pentadienyl equivalent to
carbonyl substrate 9 (Scheme 2). These include the Lewis acid-mediated
addition of 2,4-pentadienyltrimethylsilane5−7 and pentadienyltrimethylstannane8 to an aldehyde. Pentadienylzincates9 and penta-2,4-dienyltitanium complexes10 have also been successfully added to carbonyls,
and the direct addition of a 1,4-pentadienyl equivalent via treatment
with a strong base11 has also been successfully
employed. An alternate and more environmentally applicable approach
has been the addition of pentadienylindium, generated from an indium
metal and pentadienylbromide, to the requisite carbonyl. Indium has
become an important metal in Barbier-type additions to carbonyls because
of its functional group tolerance and low toxicity.12,13 Second, the 2-oxonia Cope rearrangements are not unprecedented when
performed on 1,4-dienols (Scheme 2); Nokami3a and co-workers
demonstrated that 1,4-dienol 7 undergoes a diastereoselective,
acid catalyzed, 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to give its α-product 8, in high enantiomeric excess; however, this report was limited
to only three aliphatic examples. Therefore, we would like to disclose
our results on using this 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to synthesize
1,3-dienols with aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl substitutions.

Results
and Discussion
The target compounds for our study necessitated
the selection of
aldehyde 12 as the starting point. Previous reports had
already indicated that DMF, THF, and DMSO would be ideal solvents
for the addition of bromide 13, as they all gave the
required γ-addition product. However, in a desire to use more
environmentally benign solvents, H2O was selected as the
starting point, previously used only by Fallis within the context
of bromide 13 and a small subset of aldehydes and ketones.1f,3b Consequently, when aldehyde 12 was exposed to 13, indium (1.5 equiv), and H2O, it was gratifying
to isolate the desired γ-addition product 14 in
51% isolated yield (Scheme 3). This modest yield and significant amount of the unreacted
starting material in the crude 1H NMR led us to question
the solubility of starting material 12 in H2O as the solvent. To address this a 3:1 mixture of ethanol14 and water was trialed, leading to a welcome
increased isolated yield of 67%, confirming our speculation. Finally,
a further increase in isolated yield to 81% was obtained when absolute
ethanol was used.

Scheme 3 Indium-Mediated Addition of Bromide 13 to Aldehyde 12 in H2O, Ethanol, and Mixtures
Thereof
With optimized conditions
in hand, we then examined these conditions
on aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl aldehydes that were appropriate for
our study (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of 1,4-Dienols
Benzaldehyde and 2-, 3-, and 4-bromobenzaldehyde gave
the expected
1,4-dieneol products (15–18) in good to excellent
yields of 71–92%; however, p-anisaldehyde
yielded its addition product 19 in a very poor isolated
yield of only 5%, due likely to the deactivation of the electrophile
by the methoxy group. An increase in steric bulk was accommodated
as indicated by the successful conversion of α-naphthaldehyde
giving its addition product 20 in 86% isolated yield.
Acetophenone also underwent smooth addition to give the γ-addition
product 21a in 76%; however, within the crude 1H NMR, a small trace amount of the α-addition product 22b could be identified, possibly due to the increase in steric
bulk of the electrophile. Cinnamaldehyde gave its addition product 22 in 60% isolated yield, and both linear and branched aliphatic
aldehydes gave the desired 1,4-dienols in good to high yields giving 23 and 24 in 76 and 69% yields, respectively.
The alkynyl aldehyde 12, crucial to our own work,4d could also be scaled up to 12 mmol, giving the
addition product 14 in an isolated yield of 80%. We also
found that glycoaldehyde dimer 26 could be utilized in
this process giving access to the diol 25 in 72% isolated
yield.

The isomerization of 1,4-dienols to the desired 1,3-dienols
was
optimized using substrate 15 (Scheme 5 and Table 1).

Initially,
we found that simple heating of 15 did
not yield the desired 1,3-dienol but simply returned the starting
material (entries 1 and 2). We then investigated the use of a Lewis
acid catalyst to effect the rearrangement of 15 to 27 and found that In(OTf)3,15a Sn(OTf)2, and AlCl3, all at room
temperature, achieved the rearrangement, but in poor isolated yields
(entries 3–5).16 It must be noted
that 27 was isolated in a E/Z ratio of approx. 9:1, in favor of the E-stereoisomer, in each case. With these promising results in hand,
we next examined the addition of benzaldehyde in an effort to promote
the 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement.3a,15b,15c Accordingly, upon the addition of 10 mol % of benzaldehyde,
in the presence of In(OTf)3, we isolated the desired 1,3-diene-ol 27 in a dramatically improved yield of 67% (entry 6). A screen
in the amount of benzaldehyde was then examined, but no discernible
increase in isolated yields was observed (entries 7–9). A control
experiment in the absence of Lewis acid, but in the presence of 10
mol % of benzaldehyde, confirmed the crucial role of the Lewis acid
in this rearrangement (entry 10). An increase in the reaction temperature
had no significant effect on the isolated product yield of 27 (entry 11), and when this elevated temperature attempt was performed
in the absence of benzaldehyde (entry 12), the result mirrored that
in entry 3. Finally, extending the reaction time had no noticeable
effect in the isolated yield of 27 (entry 13).

With conditions for the 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement of 1,4-dienol 15 to 27 now identified, the scope of this reaction
process was examined using 1,4-dienols from Scheme 4 (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Synthesis of 1,3-Dienols
This process was met with moderate success. The 2-, 3-,
and 4-bromoaryl
analogues were all rearranged to the target 1,3-diene-ol in good isolated
yields giving 28, 29, and 30, respectively. The α-naphthyl analogue participated in the
rearrangement giving the thermodynamic product 32 in
good yield, and the rearrangement was tolerant of alkyl substitution
as exemplified by the cyclohexyl 34 and isovaleryl 35 examples. The aryl 1,4-diene 15 could be rearranged
at an increased scale of 5 mmol giving the 1,3-diene 27 in comparable chemical yield. Finally, the TMS protected alkynyl-1,4-diene 14 was converted to its 1,3-diene isomer 36 in
a good yield, and pleasingly, this gave a valuable building block
that could be potentially used in further work toward the synthesis
of the resolvins and other marine-derived fatty acids. Unfortunately,
the 4-methoxyaryl (19), pent-4-en-2-ol (21a), cinnammyl (22), and 1,2-diol 25 precursors
gave little or none of the desired products (31, 33, 21b, and 37, respectively),
as well as yielding complex mixtures of products as identified by
NMR in each case. With regard to the E/Z stereoisomer ratio, the majority of the aryl derivatives were obtained
in a ratio in-line with the parent phenyl analogue, that is, E/Z ratio of approx. 9:1. However, the
2-bromophenyl derivative, 28, was obtained as the E-isomer exclusively, with none of its Z-isomer observed in the 1H NMR spectra. In contrast, the
cyclohexyl (34) and isovaleryl (35) analogues
were obtained in E/Z ratios of 3:2
and 3:1, respectively.

The 1,3-dienol 37 derived
from 1,2-diol 25 would have contained a useful synthetic
handle; however, its failure
to participate in the rearrangement could be mitigated as shown below
in Scheme 7. Treatment
of 15 with ethyl propiolate gave the enol ester 38, which when treated with TFA gave thermodynamic diene 39 in 82% in an E/Z ratio
of 94:6 and with a 1,3-diene with a useful synthetic handle for further
manipulation.

Scheme 7 Acid-Catalyzed Rearrangement of 1,2-Diol 38
Mechanistically, the 2-oxonia
Cope rearrangement follows the reports
previously published (Scheme 8).3,15 First, Lewis acid activation of benzaldehyde
promotes the formation of the oxocarbenium ion 41 via 40. This oxocarbenium ion 41 then undergoes a
2-oxonia Cope rearrangement to deliver the thermodynamic product 42, with none of the Prins cyclization product 43 being detected or isolated. It is assumed15,17 that the 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement goes via the corresponding
chair transition states. The dominant stereoisomer in each rearrangement
was of E-stereochemistry; however, in some cases,
a small amount of the Z-stereoisomer could be detected
by 1H NMR spectroscopy, and this presumably occurs via
bond rotation between C2–C3 within 41 as shown
by 41a and 41aa (Scheme 8).

Scheme 8 Mechanism for the Kinetic to Thermodynamic
Isomerization Using In(OTf)3
Conclusions
In
summary, we have reported a two-step process for the synthesis
of 1,3-dienols. A 2-oxonia Cope rearrangement was utilized to rearrange
1,4-dienols to their thermodynamic 1,3-dienol products, and this was
facilitated by Lewis acid catalysis with a substoichiometric amount
of the requisite aldehyde. This process has modest substrate scope
but unfortunately failed with cinnamyl-substituted systems. However,
it was demonstrated to be tolerant of alkynes, which in the context
of our research programme should provide a suitable synthetic building
for synthesizing fatty acid analogues.

Experimental Procedures
General
Procedure for Indium Addition with (E)-5-Bromopenta-1,3-diene
Aldehyde or ketone (1.00 mmol)
and (E)-5-bromopenta-1,3-diene 13 (1.20
mmol) were added to absolute ethanol (6 mL) and allowed to stir at
room temperature. Indium powder (1.50 mmol) was added slowly, so as
not to increase the temperature of the reaction mixture, and then
allowed to stir at room temperature for 72 h. The reaction mixture
was diluted with diethyl ether and then filtered through a plug of
silica. The solvent was then removed by evaporation under reduced
pressure, and the crude product was purified by column chromatography.
