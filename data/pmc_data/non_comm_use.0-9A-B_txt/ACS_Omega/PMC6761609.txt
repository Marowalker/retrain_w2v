In this work, we proposed a feasible
approach to prepare multifunctional
composite films by introducing a nanoscaled filler into a polymer
matrix. Specifically, thanks to isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) acting
as a coupling agent, the hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups on the
surface of graphene oxide (GO) and the hydroxyl groups on the surface
of silver-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles (Ag/ZnO) are covalently
grafted, forming GO–IPDI–Ag/ZnO (AGO). The prepared
AGO was then introduced into the hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) matrix
to form AGO@HPC nanocomposite films by solution blending. AGO@HPC
nanocomposite films exhibited improved mechanical, anti-ultraviolet,
and antibacterial properties. Specifically, a tensile test showed
that the tensile strength of the prepared AGO@HPC nanocomposite film
with the addition of as low as 0.5 wt % AGO was increased by about
16.2% compared with that of the pure HPC film. In addition, AGO@HPC
nanocomposite films showed a strong ultraviolet resistance and could
effectively inactivate both Gram-negative (Escherichia
coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus
aureus) bacteria at a low loading of AGO, and rapid
sterilization plays a crucial role in wound-healing. In vivo results
show that the AGO@HPC release of Ag+ and Zn2+ stimulates the immune function to produce a large number of white
blood cells and neutrophils, thereby producing the synergistic antibacterial
effects and accelerated wound-healing. Therefore, our results suggest
that these novel AGO@HPC nanocomposite films with improved mechanical,
anti-ultraviolet, and antibacterial properties could be promising
candidates for antibacterial packaging, biological wound-dressing,
etc. The abuse of antibiotics has brought about serious drug-resistant
bacteria, and our nanofilm antibacterial does not entail such problems.
In addition, local administration reduces the possibility of changing
the body’s immune system and organ toxicity, which greatly
increases the safety.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nowadays, nonrenewable
natural resources such as petroleum and
natural gas are rapidly declining. Meanwhile, various multifunctional
synthetic polymers are mainly produced from the depleted natural gas
and petroleum. Furthermore, synthetic polymers are always difficult
to be degraded, thus causing a severe white pollution. Therefore,
polymer materials with good biocompatibility and degradable properties
have attracted increased attention. Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC),
belonging to nonionic cellulose ethers, is a semi-synthetic polymer
material that is chemically modified from natural cellulose and exhibits
nontoxicity, excellent biocompatibility, and biodegradability.1 HPC has been widely considered to be an environmentally
friendly and multifunctional polymer, which has been employed in the
food-packaging, cosmetics, and biomedical fields.2−5

Although pure polymer nanocomposite
films are still far from being
satisfactory for our daily life, it has been recognized that the performance
could be significantly improved by introducing a low loading of nanofillers.
For example, a composite polymer film could exhibit improved mechanical
properties, ultraviolet (UV)–visible spectra, and antibacterial
properties by filling a nanofiller into a polymer matrix.6−11 Specifically, Liu et al. prepared a novel poly(lactic acid)–graphene
oxide (GO)–Ag hybrid nanocomposite fiber mat via electrospinning,
and they demonstrated an enhanced bactericidal activity by filling
1 wt % GO–Ag (1–7 wt %) into the poly(lactic acid) (PLA)
matrix.12 Huang et al. prepared a multifunctional
nanocomposite film with GO–ZnO (0.2–1 wt %) nanocomposites
in the PLA matrix via solution blending.13 Moreover, the antibacterial activity of E. coli and S. aureus of the PLA/GO–ZnO
nanocomposite films was clearly observed.13,14 Rehman et al. applied cornstalk cellulose nanocrystals in the presence
of a low concentration of surfactants of sodium dodecyl sulfate or
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide to fill the HPC matrix and obtained
a bio-nanocomposite film with the uniform dispersion of nanocrystals,
resulting in superior anti-UV and antibacterial properties.15

Recently, GO–inorganic nanocomposites
have been investigated
as fillers, and a series of excellent properties have been achieved.16−18 The considerable adhesion between GO and metal oxide nanomaterials
is beneficial for applications involved charge transfer.19 However, the expected effect of GO–inorganic
nanocomposites is limited when the content of inorganic nanofillers
is small. In contrast, inorganic nanofillers would form agglomerates
in the polymer matrix when increasing its amount to a certain degree.20−22 Therefore, it is critically important to find an approach to realize
the desired impacts of nanofillers. Recently, GO with a large number
of groups has been modified with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) (GO–IPDI)
to further graft organic and inorganic nanoparticles to improve certain
properties.23,24 For example, GOQD–IPDI–TA,25 CuPc-g-GO,26 GO–IPDI–MZ,27 and
GO–IPDI–CDs28 have exhibited
a range of unique and useful properties. Until now, only a few publications
focus on polymer nanocomposite films with grafted nanomaterials as
nanofillers.29,30 Ran et al. have reported a kind
of GO–HA–AgNP nanocomposite film that is based on hyaluronidase
(HAase)-triggered release to achieve effective antibacterial activity.31 The GO-based nanomaterials can raise the temperature
locally, while the hyaluronic acid (HA) template can restrain AgNPs
to protect mammalian cells. Other effective
wound dressings include CiH-HMZS/P nanocomposite electrospun fibers
designed by Zhang et al.,32 which can release
Si ions locally to promote angiogenesis and skin regeneration and
release zinc ions to enhance hair follicle regeneration as well as
inhibit bacterial growth.

In this work, nanocomposite films
were successfully prepared by
a stepwise method.33,34 First, ZnO loaded with Ag nanoparticles
(Ag/ZnO) was prepared. Then GO–IPDI–Ag/ZnO (AGO) nanocomposites
were constructed thanks to the IPDI. Finally, AGO@HPC films were prepared
through casting a mixed solution containing both HPC and AGO. The
resulting AGO@HPC films exhibited enhanced mechanical, anti-UV, and
antibacterial properties.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
All chemicals were of analytical
grade. HPC (Klucel G Industrial) was purchased from Ashland Group.
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%) and silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99%) purchased
from Guangzhou Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. were used as raw materials
to synthesize Ag/ZnO. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), chloroform (CHCl3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and graphite
powder were purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) were purchased from Guangzhou Chemical
Reagents Co., Ltd. and Guangzhou Dongzheng Chemical Reagents Co.,
Ltd., respectively. Dibutyltin(II) dilaurate (97.5%) and IPDI (98%)
were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was supplied by Shanghai
Runjie Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

2.2 Preparation
and Modification of GO
GO was prepared from graphite flake
powder through a modified Hummer’s
method according to a previous report.35 Graphite powder (2 g) and P2O5 (2 g) were
added to 46 mL of H2SO4, and then they were
stirred in an ice bath for 60 min. After 2 h, 6 g of KMnO4 was gradually added to the solution while keeping the temperature
less than 4 °C. The mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 2 h,
and it was diluted by adding 200 mL of distilled water under strong
stirring. The heating temperature was gradually raised to ∼80
°C, and the mixture was maintained for 30 min before cooling
to room temperature. The excess KMnO4 was removed by the
treatment with H2O2, and it was washed several
times with distilled water. GO was finally obtained by centrifugation
at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and dried by freeze-drying. To prepare
modified GO, 200 mg of the as-prepared GO was first dissolved in 50
mL of DMF and sonicated for 1.5 h. Then, 0.4 g of IPDI and 0.11 g
of dibutyltin(II) dilaurate, which worked as catalysts, were introduced
to the sonicated solution. After 24 h for the reaction under the condition
of 50 °C (water bath) and nitrogen atmosphere protection, the
suspension was washed with excess DMF to get rid of unreacted IPDI.
Finally, the desired GO–IPDI was dried at 50 °C in a vacuum
oven for 24 h.

2.3 Synthesis of ZnO and Ag/ZnO
Nanohybrid
Typically, 7.45 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was first dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water,
and then 0.4 M
NaOH solution was dropwise added into the above solution under vigorous
stirring. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8–9 by NaOH
solution. The mixture was continuously stirred at room temperature
for 6 h. The obtained ZnO nanoparticles were washed with plenty of
deionized water. Lastly, ZnO nanoparticles were filtered and dried
at 60 °C for 24 h.

To prepare Ag/ZnO, 0.25 g of ZnO nanoparticles
(NPs) was dispersed in 500 mL of deionized water in a three-necked
flask and uniformly dispersed after the ultrasonic treatment. Then,
5 mL of 100 mM AgNO3 was added, and they were sonicated
for 30 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8, and the solution
was stirred in an oil bath at 80 °C for 5 h. After that, it was
cooled down to room temperature and washed three times with deionized
water and ethanol. The obtained Ag/ZnO was dried at 60 °C for
48 h in a vacuum oven. The silver loading in Ag/ZnO was ∼6.13%.

2.4 Synthesis of GO–IPDI–Ag/ZnO
Briefly, 200 mg of GO–IPDI was immersed in 50 mL of DMF
by ultrasonication in a dry nitrogen atmosphere for 1.5 h. Then, a
certain amount of Ag/ZnO NPs (1, 2, and 5 wt %) was dispersed in 10
mL of anhydrous DMF for 1.5 h. Two suspensions were mixed and heated
to 50 °C under stirring for 24 h in the presence of dibutyltin
dicarboxylate. GO–IPDI–Ag/ZnO was washed at least three
times with DMF and finally dried at 50 °C for 24 h in a vacuum
oven.

2.5 Synthesis of AGO@HPC Composite Films
HPC (1 g) was dissolved in 16 mL of CHCl3 and was stirred
for 2 h. A certain amount of AGO (5 wt %) was dispersed in 4 mL of
CHCl3 and sonicated for 1.5 h. Then, AGO was added dropwise
to the HPC-containing suspension and further stirred for 4 h at 50
°C. After that, the mixed suspension was dumped into a Petri
dish. The solvent was evaporated at room temperature, and the AGO@HPC
composite film with a thickness of ∼100 μm was finally
obtained after drying at 60 °C for 48 h in vacuum. A proposed
synthetic route for AGO@HPC is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Proposed Synthetic Route for AGO@HPC
2.6 Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a Blagg MSAL-XD2
(Beijing, China) instrument with a Cu Kα radiation source (45
kV, 20 mA, and λ = 0.15406 nm). A 2θ range of 10–80°
was recorded in 0.02° steps at a rate of 2°/min. A Bruker
(Germany) Vertex 70 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer
was used to perform the infrared analyses using the KBr pellet method.
The spectra comprised 64 scans at a resolution of 1 cm–1 in the 4000–400 cm–1 spectral range. Thermogravimetric
(TG) analyses were carried out using a Netzsch (Germany) 209 F1 thermogravimetric
analyzer. About 5 mg of samples in sealed aluminum pans were analyzed
under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA)
curves and derivative thermogravimetry curves were recorded from room
temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, ZEISS ULTRA 55) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, JEM-2010 HR) were used to record the morphology, respectively,
with accelerating voltages of 20 and 80 kV to study the morphology
of the complex. Changes in the UV–visible spectra were monitored
with a Shimadzu UV-2101PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating
sphere.

2.7 Antibacterial Activity Evaluation
The antibacterial activity of the synthesized nanocomposite films
were evaluated by the diameter of the inhibition zone on plates with
solid-state nutrient agar against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus). The nutrient broth (in tubes), nutrient
agar (in flasks), and 0.85 wt % physiological saline (in flasks) were
separately prepared and placed. The filled tubes and flasks were sealed
with a piece of gauze and newspapers and further sterilized at 121
°C in an autoclave for 15 min. Nutrient broth was further applied
to incubate the bacteria, and it was put on a shaker for several days.
The freshly grown bacterial solution (100 μL) was transferred
to solid-state agar plates evenly. AGO@HPC composite films were laid
on plates with solid-state nutrient agar in an incubator at 37 °C
for 1 day after the bacterial solution was completely diffused. Bear
in mind, the whole process is carried out in a sterile environment.
The diameter of the inhibition zone around the AGO@HPC composite film
was measured at least three times. In addition, three replicates were
performed under the same condition.

2.8 In Vivo
Animal Experience
The male
BALB/C mice (6 weeks) used in this experiment were provided by the
Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center. The mice were individually
raised in cages for 1 week before animal experience. The temperature
of animal cages is between 20 and 26 °C, and the relative humidity
is between 40 and 70%. All of the mice were divided into four groups
(each group containing five mice): control group (treated by HPC),
HPC–AGO-0.5 group (treated by HPC–AGO-0.5), HPC–AGO-1.0
group (treated by HPC–AGO-1.0), and HPC–AGO-2.0 group
(treated by HPC–AGO-2.0), while every group has five mice.
The mice were anesthetized by 6% chloral hydrate (0.45 mg/kg). We
have built a wound model with a diameter of 6 mm on the back of each
mouse surgically. Besides, the S. aureus (1.0 × 107 CFU/mL) was
smeared on the thickness wounds. As the treatment beginning, each
of the therapeutic dressings (such as HPC/HPC–AGO-0.5/HPC–AGO-1.0/HPC–AGO-2.0
described as before) was covered on the thickness wounds correspondingly.
The dressings were changed every 2 days. Furthermore, the thickness
wounds were observed and photographed. The skin tissues were sliced
and stained with H&E and photographed by a microscope. The main
organs like the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney were sliced
and stained with H&E after the 14 day treatment. The picture has
been taken as described before.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Structure and Morphology
of Composite Materials
XRD patterns were recorded to check
the possible structure evolution
after composite formation. As shown in Figure 1a, the diffraction peak around 2θ =
10.5° can be indexed to the (002) plane of GO and the corresponding
interlayer spacing is ∼0.842 nm, indicating that the surface
of GO is decorated with carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. The peak of
GO is broadened and the average crystallinity is reduced compared
with that of graphite carbon.36 As can
be seen from Figure 1b, a diffraction peak appears at 2θ = 7.0°, and the corresponding
layer spacing is ∼1.263 nm. The shifts of GO–IPDI to
a lower angle compared to that of the GO is mainly due to the intercalation
between IPDI and GO layers. The introduction of IPDI increases the
spacing of the GO interplanar layer. It also suggests that IPDI could
play an important role in preventing graphene sheets from collapsing.
As presented in Figure 1c, characteristic planes of both GO and ZnO are clearly observed,
indicative of the effective composite formation. The absence of Ag
peaks is due to a low loading in Ag/ZnO. Anyway, Ag peaks of (111)
and (200) planes can still be detected in Ag/ZnO (Figure 1d). Figure 1d also suggests that the ZnO is a hexagonal
wurtzite structure,37 and the corresponding
planes are marked above the peak.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of GO (a), GO–IPDI
(b), AGO (c), and Ag/ZnO
(d).

FT-IR was carried out to detect
the possible evolution of the groups
after composite formation. As shown in Figure 2a, the characteristic bands of 3395.9 cm–1 (OH), 1723.3 cm–1 (C=O),
and 1621.6 cm–1 (C=C bond stretch) are clearly
observed in GO. In addition, absorption peaks at 1223.0 and 1049.4
cm–1 correspond to stretching vibrations of epoxy
(C-OH) and alkoxy (C–O), respectively. For GO–IPDI,
the C=O stretching vibration peak at 1723.3 cm–1 weakens, and new absorption peaks appear (Figure 2b,). Absorption peaks at 1647.9 and 1435.3
cm–1 correspond to the stretching vibration peak
of C–N in the carboxyl and carbamate in the amide. The absorption
peak at 2275–2363 cm–1 is attributed to the
characteristic absorption peak of −NCO, indicating that a chemical
reaction occurs when modifying GO with IPDI. As shown in Figure 2c, the characteristic
peak of the isocyanate group disappears due to the chemical reaction
between the isocyanate group and the hydroxyl group on the surface
of ZnO.

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of GO (a), GO–IPDI (b), and AGO (c).

The surface morphologies of Ag/ZnO, GO, GO–IPDI, and
AGO
were investigated by SEM and TEM. As shown in the TEM image (Figure 3a), Ag NPs are evenly
loaded on the surface of ZnO. From the SEM images (Figure 3c,d), the surface morphology
varies greatly. The surface of GO is randomly folded. After grafting
of IPDI, the sheet structure is almost preserved, but it becomes more
compact. In addition, wrinkles and curved edges appear, which is due
to the covalent bonding between IPDI and GO. For AGO (Figure 3d), after grafting Ag/ZnO nanoparticles
on the surface of GO–IPDI, it can be clearly seen that the
surface of the sheet becomes more wrinkled because Ag/ZnO is well
covalently grafted into the gap of GO–IPDI and evenly dispersed
between its surface and between layers. In addition, some of the silver-loaded
zinc oxide surface Ag NPs begin to detach from the surface and are
uniformly dispersed on the fracture surface.

and SEM images of GO (b), GO–IPDI
(c) and AGO (d).

3.2 Mechanical,
Thermal, Anti-UV, and Antibacterial
Properties of Composite Films
Shown in Figure 4 and Table 1 are the stress–strain curve and the corresponding
tensile strength and elongation at break of HPC, HPC–AGO-0.5,
HPC–AGO-1.0, and HPC–AGO-2.0. The tensile strength of the composite film is significantly increased
with the incorporation of AGO, and it could be gradually increased
by forming composites with an increased amount of AGO. Compared with
the pure HPC film, the tensile strength of the composite film blended
with 0.5 wt % AGO increased by ∼16.2%, indicating that the
intercalation of AGO into the HPC matrix contributes greatly to the
enhanced intermolecular interaction. The possible formation of increased
physical or chemical cross-linking points thanks to the existence
of surface hydroxyls is beneficial to improve mechanical properties.38 Moreover, the tensile strength of HPC–AGO-2.0
increases by about 72.5%, which can be explained by the fact that
the AGO sheet can be well-embedded in the HPC matrix, resulting in
a strong interaction. In addition, the elongation at break of composite
films is slightly reduced, which may slightly decrease the stretchability.

Figure 4 Tensile
stress–strain curves of the pure HPC and AGO@HPC
films.

and Elongation at

HPC–AGO-1.0	23.6 ± 0.3	20.9 ± 0.2	
HPC–AGO-2.0	28.8 ± 0.1	18.9 ± 0.2	
The cross-sectional microstructures of the pure HPC and AGO@HPC
films are shown in Figure 5. The HPC film shows a smooth and uniform structure (Figure 5a). For the HPC–AGO-0.5
composite film (Figure 5b), a coarse structure can be clearly seen, which is due to the embedding
of AGO into the HPC matrix. It is observed that the AGO composite
is well-dispersed in the HPC matrix, which implies a good compatibility
and a strong cross-linking between AGO and HPC. With the increase
of the AGO content, the cross-sectional morphology of the composite
films become more rough, and some nanoscaled pieces of AGO are pulled
out. It may be due to fact that the gap between the fibrous HPC matrix
is quite small, owing to which AGO tends to gather together.

Figure 5 Cross-sectional
SEM images of HPC (a), HPC–AGO-0.5 (b),
HPC–AGO-1.0 (c), and HPC–AGO-2.0 (d).

Figure 6 shows
TG
curves of the pure HPC and HPC composite films. The thermal degradation
process of all films can be divided into two stages. The weight loss
in the first stage (<100 °C) is about 3%, which is caused
by the evaporation of residual water and organic solvents in the film.
The second stage is at 240–440 °C with a weight loss of
up to >90%, mainly due to the decomposition of HPC. Specifically,
the average decomposition temperature of the HPC–AGO-2.0 film
is 364.8 °C (enlarged view in the bottom left of Figure 6), which is a bit lower than
that of pure HPC (370.9 °C), indicating that the stability of
the HPC film is slightly weakened due to the embedding of AGO. The
carbon black yield of the AGO@HPC composite films reflected by the
residual weight after 440 °C is slightly lower than that of the
pure HPC film, implying that there is an interaction between AGO and
the HPC matrix, consistent with the above results.

(a), HPC–AGO-0.5 (b), HPC–AGO-1.0
(c), and HPC–AGO-2.0 (d) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
in a nitrogen atmosphere.

To further analyze the stability of the pure HPC and HPC composite
films, a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed,
as shown in Figure 7. Two endothermic peaks can be clearly observed, closely related
to the stability of HPC. Endothermic peaks of HPC–AGO-0.5,
HPC–AGO-1.0, and HPC–AGO-2.0 are at ∼371.7, 370.2,
and 367.3 °C, respectively, while the endothermic peak of pure
HPC is at ∼372.0 °C, suggesting that the addition of AGO
may slightly affect the thermal stability of HPC. However, we have
to point out that the AGO@HPC composite films still maintain high
stability.

Figure 7 DSC curves of pure HPC (a), HPC–AGO-0.5 (b), HPC–AGO-1.0
(c), and HPC–AGO-2.0 (d) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Anti-UV properties of HPC and AGO@HPC films were determined by
UV–visible spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 8. It can be clearly seen that pure HPC (Figure 8a) absorbs ultraviolet
light (200–400 nm) but hardly absorbs visible light (400 =
800 nm), with a transmittance of about 90%. HPC–AGO-0.5 exhibits
a certain UV resistance and a good visible light transmittance of
about 84% (Figure 8b). With the increase of the AGO addition such as 1 wt % (Figure 8c) and 2 wt % (Figure 8d), the UV resistance
is significantly improved. In particular, in the range of 200–800
nm, HPC–AGO-2.0 shows quite a low light transmittance of about
45%, implying enhanced barrier properties. The enhanced anti-UV properties
and the absence of additional peaks suggest the homogeneous dispersion
of AGO in the HPC matrix.

HPC–AGO-0.5
(b), HPC–AGO-1.0 (c), and HPC–AGO-2.0 (d).

Finally, antibacterial properties were systematically investigated.
Gram-negative E. coli are one of the
major categories of Enterobacteriaceae and are commonly found in the
urinary tract and in the bloodstream as well as in the wound infection
of hospital patients. S. aureus is
a representative of Gram-positive bacteria and can cause many serious
infections, often resulting in a high morbidity and mortality. Therefore,
Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli) and
Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus)
were employed to check the antibacterial properties of HPC and AGO@HPC
composite films.

The inhibition zones of HPC and AGO@HPC films
against E. coli and S. aureus are shown in Figure 9. HPC does not show the bactericidal activity,
but the addition of
AGO to HPC inhibits the growth of E. coli and S. aureus to a certain extent.
As listed in Table 2, the diameters of the inhibition zones of HPC–AGO-0.5, HPC–AGO-1.0,
and HPC–AGO-2.0 for E. coli are
11.25 ± 0.45, 11.79 ± 0.39, and 12.32 ± 0.65 mm, while
the inhibition zones for S. aureus are
12.18 ± 0.32, 12.71 ± 0.21, and 13.76 ± 0.48 mm. The
antibacterial properties of AGO@HPC films increase with the addition
of AGO. In addition, the diameters of the inhibition zones for E. coli and S. aureus are obviously different when adopting the same film, which may be
caused by the different cell structures of bacteria.39

diameters of the inhibition zones formed by HPC, HPC–AGO-0.5,

HPC–AGO-2.0	12.32 ± 0.65	13.76 ± 0.48	
The antibacterial mechanism is summarized as follows: (1) under
the irradiation of a high energy, ZnO NPs can generate negatively
charged electrons (e–) and positively charged holes
(h+). e– and h+ can induce
redox reactions on the surface of ZnO. h+ can react with
OH– to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH•) on the surface of ZnO NPs as well as superoxide anions (O2–) and peroxy radicals (HO2•).40 These highly active free radicals
can destroy the structure of microbial cells, thus exhibiting a bactericidal
effect. (2) Zinc ions will be released when ZnO NPs come in contact
with bacteria. The released zinc ions may penetrate the wall of the
bacterial cell and may react with active proteases inside the bacteria.41,42 (3) In addition, Ag NPs exhibit effective bactericidal activity.
Ag+ can attach to the surface of bacterial cells, and disrupt
its permeability and enter the cytoplasm, thus affecting the internal
processes of cells and acting as a bactericidal agent.43,44 Moreover, the released Ag+ can interact with the hydrophobic
group of bacterial proteins to promote oxidative stress, which can
cause damage to proteins and DNA, and further destroy the ability
of DNA to replicate and kill bacteria.45−48 The diameter of the Ag NPs (1.44
Å) is significantly smaller than the diameter of the ZnO ions,
thus making them easier to escape from the HPC matrix, anchoring on
the surface and inside of the HPC matrix.29,49,50 In this work, Ag-loaded ZnO was grafted
on the surface of GO, which provides a stable structure for the synergistic
antibacterial activity. HPC was used
as the matrix to make AGO embed and interact evenly, thus leading
to the release of antibacterial substances with a long-acting antibacterial
effect.

3.3 In Vivo Assessment of Wound-Healing
BALB/C mice have been used to build the skinny wound model. All of
the animal models were divided into four groups: control group (treated
by HPC, group I), HPC–AGO-0.5 group (treated by HPC–AGO-0.5,
group II), HPC–AGO-1.0 group (treated by HPC–AGO-1.0,
group III), and HPC–AGO-2.0 group (treated by HPC–AGO-2.0,
group IV). The traumas were photographed on days 0, 4, 6, 8, and 12,
as shown in Figure 10. Compared with group I, groups II, III, and IV show a smaller trauma
size and less ichor after the 8 day treatment. Especially, the wounds
in the control group on days 4 and 6 showed severe suppuration. After
12 days of treatment, the wounds of group II (treated by HPC–AGO-0.5)
and group III (treated by HPC–AGO-1.0) showed significant healing.
In general, the groups treated by AGO@HPC showed a better curative
effect, and the added AGO nanocomposite protected the body from bacterial
infection.

Figure 10 In vivo assessments of the curative effect-corresponding
wound
photographs.

The wound tissues on days 2, 6,
and 12 were stained by hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). As shown in Figure 11, inflammatory reactions recruited a large
number of neutrophils, which infiltrated the wound when bacterial
infection occurred in vivo. With the process of wound-healing, newborn
blood vessels (red rectangles) filled with a lot of red blood cells
appeared in groups II, III, and IV. However, many necrotic foci (blank
rectangles) have been observed in group I. Furthermore, the major
organs (such as heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) of mice were
stained by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The results shown in Figure 12 do not indicate
any damage effects after the treatment.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, multifunctional
nanocomposite films composed of
HPC and the AGO nanofillers were prepared by solution blending. XRD,
FT-IR, and SEM results showed that the Ag/ZnO was successfully grafted
on the GO surface, thus leading to the presence of the interaction
between them. AGO nanocomposite materials were embedded and uniformly
dispersed in the HPC matrix to form AGO@HPC films according the cross-sectional
SEM images. The existence of a large number of hydroxyl groups led
to a good mixing and a strong interaction between AGO and HPC. The
tensile results suggested that the mechanical properties of AGO@HPC
films were enhanced, while thermal measurements such as TG and DSC
demonstrated that although decreased, the high stability of AGO@HPC
films was still maintained. In addition, AGO@HPC nanocomposite films
showed a strong UV resistance and could effectively inactivate both
Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive
(S. aureus) bacteria, and they also
showed accelerated wound-healing. These effects could be further improved
on further increasing the AGO content. Therefore, our results suggest
that multifunctional AGO@HPC nanocomposite films with mechanical,
anti-UV, and antibacterial properties could be applied in fields such
as anti-UV treatment, antibacterial packaging, and biological wound-dressing.
