The practical synthesis of novel
multivalent fluorescent quantum-dot-based
probes to target cellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (MT-MMPs)
is reported. We show that these probes, which are decorated with a
nanomolar water-soluble MMP inhibitor, can be used to label preferentially
the surface of cancer cells that are known to express MMPs while no
binding was observed on cells that do not.

Introduction
Matrix metalloproteinases
(MT-MMPs) are a family of structural
and functional-related Zn-containing endopeptidases almost ubiquitously
expressed and largely involved in physiological processes. When abnormally
expressed, however, they trigger many pathological events including
cancer, where the strict physiological control of MMPs’ activity
is disrupted, thus promoting tumor cell migration from original sites
and invasion of distant organs.1−3

The inhibition of MMPs has
been an extensively pursued therapeutic
strategy to treat cancer but at present, MMPs are considered elusive
targets for they are characterized by similar active sites able to
adapt for binding ligands. Nonetheless, a large number of synthetic
inhibitors were published, and some of them entered clinical trials.
The failure of these trials was mainly ascribed to the lack of solubility
in water and poor bioavailability of all of the inhibitors tested.
The latter is also responsible for severe side-effects in the case
of chronic treatments4,5 and explains why no synthetic
MMP inhibitor (MMPI) is currently used clinically for cancer treatment.6 The recent development of nanomolar, water-soluble
MMPIs7 (Figure 1) certainly represents a step forward in
the use of synthetic inhibitors for MMPs’ targeting and in
vivo inhibition. The lack of selectivity, however, still impairs their
use in therapy.

hydroxamic acid) (NNGH) and of water-soluble MMPIs A–C. In A and B, the isobutyl residue of NNGH
is replaced by a dihydroxyl residue and C by a glucose
moiety.

Among MMPs, MMP-14 is one of the
six MMPs referred to as membrane-anchored
MMPs (MT-MMPs). MMP-14 is correlated with angiogenesis,8 and a high expression of MMP-14 is also associated
with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients,9 with lymph node metastasis and with malignant brain tumors10 and melanoma.11 The
pivotal role played by MMP-14 and by MT-MMPs, in general, is mainly
because of their localization at the focal cell surface, where they
create the proteolytic favorable conditions for cancer cells to progress
and invade the extracellular matrix.12 The
association and pathological correlation between the high expression
of MMP-14 and a shortened survival in cancer patients make the MT-MMPs
targeting and imaging a goal of primary importance for the early diagnosis
and monitoring of MMP-14-mediated tumors. MMP-14 is highly expressed
in a number of invasive cancer cell lines such as MDA-MB231 (triple
negative breast cancer cell)13 and also
present in HeLa (cervical cancer cell line),14 whereas not found in MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line).13

To date, MMP imaging has been reported
with either fluorescent
molecules or labeled MMPIs, for preclinical applications and, more
recently, in some animal models.15−18 In recent years, luminescent
semiconductors, quantum dots (QDs), have emerged as versatile nanoplatforms
for nonisotopic detection suitable to live cells, in vivo imaging,
and immunoassays because of their superior photostability to organic
fluorophores and dyes, in addition to their bright visible emission,
narrow emission spectra, and common excitation.17−20 Capitalizing on the extensive
experience of some of us on the synthesis and functionalization of
QDs, we decorated these stable fluorescent nanoparticles with water-soluble
MMPI residues to obtain a probe to visualize cancer cells by targeting
MT-MMPs expressed on their surface.

Results and Discussion
The MMPI selected to conjugate to the surface of the QDs, 1,23 is structurally related to
NNGH (Scheme 1) and
displays a triethylene glycol residue linked to sulfonamidic nitrogen
(Scheme 1). This polar
linker accounts for a good solubility in water of the inhibitor. The
replacement of the triethylene glycol residue with an aliphatic chain
of the same length was also considered, but this structural modification
impaired the water solubility. The synthesis of 1 was
performed by reacting the commercially available sulfonyl chloride 2 with methyl glycinate to yield the corresponding sulfonamide
derivative 3, which was subsequently reacted with triethylene
glycol 4 under Mitsunobu reaction conditions to yield 5 (86% over the 2 steps) (Scheme 1). Ester 5 was hydrolyzed [LiOH,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), rt, quantitative yield], and the resulting
acid 6, activated with [2-(1H-bezotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium
tetrafluoborate] (TBTU) and (N-methyl morfoline)
(NMM), was treated with NH2OBn in dry N,N-dimethylfomamide to give benzyl hydroxamate 7 (78%). After hydrogenation (Pd/C, THF–H2O >90%) and removal of the
Boc protecting group [trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), dichloromethane,
rt], inhibitor 1 was isolated quantitatively.21

The inhibition constant of 1 toward MMP-12a,24 was evaluated
in vitro by a spectrofluorimetric assay.5 The Ki value obtained (20 ± 9 nm)
confirmed that the very good affinity of the NNGH is preserved for 1 and that, as expected,13 the
ethylene glycol portion is marginally involved in the binding.

Monodispersed trioctylphosphine oxide-coated CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles
were prepared, as previously reported21,22 (see the Supporting Information). Ligand exchange under
reductive conditions with a 2:3 mixture of lipoic acid-PEG-COOH 8 (for biomolecule conjugation) and lipoic acid-PEG-OH 9 (as spacer) in water/EtOH as the solvent gave 70% acid-functionalized QD-70COOH (hydrodynamic size: 9.0 ± 0.2 nm) (Figures 2 and S1A in the Supporting Information). It was deemed necessary
to extend the linkers grafted on QD-70COOH and to enhance
the nanoparticle water solubility after MMPI conjugation (see the Supporting Information for details).25 Thus, the treatment of QD-70COOH with diamino-tetraethylene glycol using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC·HCl) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed
by further functionalization of the resulting terminal amine groups
with MMPI 1 upon reaction with EDC and succinic anhydride
in PBS as solvent, afforded QD-1 (hydrodynamic size 304
± 18 nm) nanoparticles, which are soluble in and stable in water
solution for 2 days after sonication (Figure 2 and Supporting Information for details).

Toxicity studies for MMPI 1 (10 μg/mL) and QD-1 (1 μg/mL) were
then carried out in HeLa (human
cervical) and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (human breast) cancer cells (see
the Supporting Information for full experimental
details). Cultures were exposed to these compounds for 72 h. Cell
viability and metabolic competence were assessed by Alamar Blue (AB),
and the number of live cells with Calcein AM and of dead cells were
assessed using Sytox. The ratio of AB/Calcein affords a measure of
metabolic function per cell, providing a metric to compare treated
cells against untreated cells (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). In the case of MCF-7 and MDA, neither
the number of live cells or dead cells was significantly affected
by the treatment with a solution of 1 or QD-1 (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA, see the Supporting Information). In MCF7 cell cultures treated with QD-1, however, the reductive metabolism was significantly increased compared
to untreated controls (p < 0.001) (Figure S5 in
the Supporting Information).

To evaluate
the potential of QD-1 in targeting and
visualizing MMP-overexpressing cancer cells with respect to other
cells, the two human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231)
and the human cervix epitheloid carcinoma cell line (HeLa) were incubated
for a period of 2 and 4 h with QD-1 (200 μg/mL)
or 2 h exposure to a mixture of QD-1 (200 μg/mL)
and 1 (10 μg/mL) and taken directly to be imaged.
Of note, QD-1 was not taken up intracellularly, as determined
by confocal microscopy, by any of the cell lines studied after 2 or
4 h exposure. However, fluorescent labeling by QD-1 was
predominantly found on the surface of HeLa and MDA cells, which are
known to express MMPs including MMP-14 (Figures 3 and S6–S8).13,14 Furthermore, colocalization experiments
using CellMask red staining to label the cell membrane18 confirmed that the QDs decorated with the MMPI 1 (QD-1) were mostly bound to the cell surface.
Quantification of the fluorescence labeling was carried out for each
cell line (see the Supporting Information for details). In general, significant differences among mean fluorescent
intensities were observed when comparing untreated cells with QD-1 exposed cells. Interestingly, an 18% enhancement of fluorescence
is observed only for MDA-MB-31 and HeLa cells, when cells are incubated
with QD-1 in conjunction with monovalent MMPI 1 for 2 h, further supporting that the probes are selective for these
MMP-expressing cancer cell lines. These results suggest that the probes
can differentiate between cancer cell lines and as such could potentially
be used to target and image cell-surface MMP receptors.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the practical
and expedient synthesis of novel QD-based
fluorescent probes to target cellular MT-MMPs is reported. The probes
bear a novel and water-soluble MMPI which was prepared readily for
nanoparticle conjugation. We showed that the probes do not elicit
any significant toxicity in any of the cells evaluated. More excitingly,
confocal microscopy experiment showed that the MMPI probes (QD-1) bind preferentially to the surface of cancer cell lines
that are known to express MMPs (e.g., HeLa and MDA-MB-231), whereas
no binding was observed on cells that do not (MCF-7), suggesting that
these fluorescent probes can discern between cell lines and thus could
be utilized as diagnostic tools.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals were purchased and used without further purification.
Dry solvents were obtained by distillation using standard procedures
or by passage through a column of anhydrous alumina using equipment
from Anhydrous Engineering (University of Bristol) based on the Grubbs’
design. Reactions requiring anhydrous conditions were performed under
N2; glassware and needles were either flame-dried immediately
prior to use or placed in an oven (150 °C) for at least 2 h and
allowed to cool in desiccators or under reduced pressure. Liquid reagents,
solutions, or solvents were added via syringe through rubber septa;
solid reagents were added via Schlenk-type adapters. Teflon rings
were used between the joints of the condensers and round-bottom flasks.
Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography on Kieselgel
60 F254 (Merck), with UV light (254 nm) detection and by charring
with 10% sulfuric acid in ethanol. Flash column chromatography was
performed using silica gel [Merck, 230–400 mesh (40–63
μm)]. Extracts were concentrated in vacuum using both a Büchi
rotary evaporator (bath temperatures up to 40 °C) at a pressure
of 15 mmHg (diaphragm pump) or 0.1 mmHg (oil pump), as appropriate,
and a high vacuum line at room temperature. Water-soluble compounds
were freeze-dried on a Lytotrap Plus (LTE Scientific LTD). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured in the solvent
stated at 400, 500, or 600 MHz. Chemical shifts are quoted in parts
per million from residual solvent peak (CDCl3: 1H—7.26 ppm and 13C—77.16 ppm) and coupling
constants (J) given in hertz. Multiplicities are
abbreviated as b (broad), s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q
(quartet), m (multiplet), or combinations thereof. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) and zeta analysis are carried out using Malvern Instruments,
Nano_S90 Red Laser model ZEN1690 for DLS, and Nano-Z ZEN 2600 for
zeta potential.

Cell Culture
Two human breast carcinoma cell lines,
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were used in this study, as well as the human
cervix epitheloid carcinoma cell line HeLa. All cells were purchased
from ECCAC, Public Health England. MCF-7 cells were maintained in
minimal essential medium, MDA in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g of glucose/L and HeLa in DMEM with 1 g of
glucose/L. All media (Thermo-Fisher) were supplemented with antibiotic–antimycotic
[and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Thermo-Fisher)] for routine culture.

Incubation of QD-1 with Cells
Confluent
cultures were detached from the surface using trypsin (Tryp LE Express)
and plated at 2 × 104 cells/well in either Petri dishes
(Mat-Tek 35 mm, with 14 mm glass microwell) for imaging or 96-well
plates for other tests. All cell culture media and additives were
purchased from Invitrogen, Life Technologies.

MCF7, MDA-MB-231,
and HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min, 1, 2, and 4 h with QD-1 (200 μg/mL), followed by extensive PBS washes,
and imaged immediately thereafter in the imaging buffer. It was determined
that although minimum labeling was observed at 30 μg/mL of QD-1, 200 μg/mL was optimum for effective labeling.
Higher concentrations of QD-1 were not used to avoid
nanoparticle clustering and precipitation of the stocks. It was also
observed that 2 h incubation was optimum for the effective cell labeling.

a As reported above (see Introduction), MMPs’ active sites are closely similar
and able to adjust hosting also ligands designed for a specific member
of the family. Thus, the inhibition constant of 1 was
assessed toward MMP-12, which is remarkably more stable than MMP-14;
MMP-14 instability might have affected the measurements.
