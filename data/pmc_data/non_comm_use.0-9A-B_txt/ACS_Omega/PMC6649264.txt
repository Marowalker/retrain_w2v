Semiclathrate
hydrates are a crystalline host–guest material,
which forms with water and ionic substances such as tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA) salts. Various anions can be used
as a counter anion to the TBA cation, and they can modify thermodynamic
properties of the semiclathrate hydrates, which are critical for applications,
for example, cold energy storage and gas separation. In this study,
the semiclathrate hydrates of the TBA glycolate were newly synthesized.
Measurements for melting temperatures and a heat of fusion and a crystal
structure analysis were performed. In comparison with the other similar
materials, such as acetates, propionates, lactates, and hydroxybutyrates,
the glycolate greatly changed the melting temperature and the heat
of fusion. The preliminarily determined crystal structure showed that
the glycolate anion builds a relatively porous structure compared
to the previously reported hydrates formed with hydroxycarboxylates.
The present study showed that substitution of a hydrophobic group
by a hydrophilic group is an effective method to control the thermodynamic
properties as well as to improve environmental, biological, and chemical
properties.

1 Introduction
Semiclathrate
hydrates are crystalline host–guest compounds
formed from water and ionic/nonionic substances such as ammonium salts
and amines. As the semiclathrate hydrates are highly stable even at
around 300 K at atmospheric pressure, these materials can be used
for cold energy storage.4−8 In addition, the semiclathrate hydrates can capture gas under moderate
temperature and pressure conditions.9−17 From these unique properties, many industrial applications are proposed
so far.18−22 Semiclathrate hydrates are similar compounds to gas hydrates formed
from water and small gases, for example, methane, carbon dioxide,
and hydrogen.1,2 The major difference between these
materials is that the semiclathrate hydrates form from water and ionic
substances with/without gas. The ionic substances are stably incorporated
in the cage-like network, whereas they also make hydrogen bonds to
cage water molecules. Therefore, the ionic substances are regarded
as both hosts and guests for the hydrates. Tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA) and tetra-n-butylphosphonium
(TBP) salts are widely used ionic substances to form the semiclathrate
hydrates.3−8 In the structure of TBA and TBP salt hydrates, the TBA or TBP cation
occupies a four-cage fused-cage, for example, three tetrakaidecahedral
cages plus one pentakaidecahedral cage, to incorporate each carbon
chain into one of the four cages.1−4,7,8 The rest of the structure is composed of pentagonal
dodecahedral cages made by water and the counter anion of the TBA
or TBP cation. The dodecahedral cage can incorporate small gases such
as CH4, CO2, N2, and H2.10,17,23,24 There are various options for counter anions for
these cations, and the thermodynamic properties of the semiclathrate
hydrates are significantly changed by the anions.

Melting temperatures
of the TBA and TBP halide hydrates simply
decrease from fluoride (or hydroxide) to bromide.8 In most cases, the halide anions replace a water molecule
in the hydrogen bond network.4,7 Carboxylates also form
semiclathrate hydrates with the aid of TBA or TBP cations.5,25−31 Compared to the halide anions, the tendency on melting temperature
with carboxylates is quite different. For linear carboxylates between
formate and valerate, propionate and butyrate have the maximal melting
temperature. This means that a change in the carbon chain length can
control the melting temperature of TBA carboxylate hydrates. On the
basis of their crystal structures,26−29 the carboxy group of the anions
makes hydrogen bonds with the cage water molecules, and the hydrophobic
carbon chain is oriented toward the cage center. In addition to the
carboxylates, hydroxycarboxylates can also form semiclathrate hydrates.32−34 By adding a hydroxy group to carboxylates, it is possible to improve
the environmental, chemical, and biological properties such as stench
and biodegradability.32 In the case of
lactate anions, it was found that the carboxy group bonded to the
cage water, and the hydroxy group additionally bonded to the water.
As a result, the lactate anion was restricted on the cage wall compared
to the propionate anion.28 In our previous
studies, two hydroxybutyrates, that is, 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB)33 and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB),34 were also subjected to hydrate formation. The melting temperatures
of these hydrates significantly differ: 285.3 K for 2HB and 282.2
K for 3HB, whereas the heats of fusion were similar. These results
show that a position of the hydroxy group in the anion significantly
changes the thermodynamic properties of semiclathrate hydrates.

Among the linear carboxylates, the propionate is a unique ionic
substance that induces the cubic structure of the semiclathrate hydrate
probably because of the suitably sized carbon chain to be incorporated
in the dodecahedral cage.28 The cubic structure
results from the good symmetric hydration of the anion in the dodecahedral
cage. Glycolate is the anion for which a hydroxy group replaces a
methyl group in the propionate. When a hydroxy group substitutes a
methyl group, the hydration of the anion would become different, which
may also affect the thermodynamic properties of the semiclathrate
hydrates. In order to develop a crystal engineering technique on the
semiclathrate hydrates, modification of the anions by a hydroxy group
needs to be understood. In this study, we report thermodynamic properties
and a crystal structure analysis of TBA glycolate hydrates. The melting
temperatures and the heat of fusion were measured and a crystal structure
of the TBA glycolate hydrate was analyzed.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Materials
The used water was made
from deionized water that was sterilized by ultraviolet and filtrated
by activated carbon and a hollow fiber. The electrical resistivity
of the water was >18.2 MΩ. TBA glycolate was synthesized
by
the neutralization of TBA hydroxide (Tokyo Chemical Industry, 42.9
mass % in water) and glycol acid (Aldrich, >99%). The obtained
aqueous
solution was refined by crystallization. The water contained in the
melt solution was evaporated to gravimetrically determine the salt
concentration. The content of the solution was further confirmed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements
by an NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, AVANCE 500). For the differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, c-hexane
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., 99.8%) is used.

2.2 Melting Temperature Measurements
The melting temperature
measurements were performed by optical observation
of the crystals during stepwise temperature increase as we used in
the previous studies.32,33 We prepared about 2 g of the
aqueous solution samples in a glass tube. Mole fraction (x) and mass fraction (w) of the TBA glycolate were
gravimetrically determined with the aid of an electronic balance (AUW220D,
Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). The tubes were set in a temperature-controlled
bath. Once the bath was cooled down sufficiently to form hydrates,
the system temperature was increased with a step of 0.2 or 0.1 K.
The system temperature (T) was measured by a thermometer
(NRHS1-0, Chino Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and a bridge (F201B, Chino,
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Hydrate crystals were observed by a microscope
and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. At each temperature step,
the hydrate crystals were equilibrated until their appearances had
not changed. The melting temperature was determined to be the temperature
one step before the temperature at which all hydrate crystals in a
tube melted.

2.3 DSC Measurements
DSC (DSC-60, Shimadzu
Co., Kyoto, Japan) was used for heats of fusion of the hydrates. An
aqueous solution of TBA glycolate was supplied in an aluminum cell,
the volume of which was approximately 20 μL. The cell was sealed
by an aluminum lid. As a reference, we measured a heat of fusion of c-hexane, which was reported to be 31.84 kJ/kg in the literature.35 DSC peaks were measured under nitrogen gas flow.
Once the cell was cooled down to 250 K approximately, a heat of hydrate
formation was observed. As the sample occasionally contains ice and
metastable hydrate phases, we melted them at around a melting temperature
of a stable hydrate phase. Subsequently, we gently cooled the sample
to ∼270 K. This process enables to grow a stable hydrate phase
selectively in the cell. The system temperature was increased with
a rate of 2 K/min, and we obtained a heat of fusion of the hydrate
from a DSC peak area. The measurement uncertainty of the heat of fusion
was 6 kJ/kg.

2.4 Crystal Structure Analysis
Single
crystals of the TBA glycolate hydrates were formed from the aqueous
solution with x = 0.0293 at T =
278.2 K. The subcooling temperature was 2.7 K, which enables to grow
thick crystals. After a sufficient number of suitably sized crystals
grew, the crystals were separated from the residual aqueous solution.
The crystals were preserved in a freezer at 260 K. In the followed
processes, the crystals were kept under this temperature to avoid
melting. A crystal was chosen and mounted on a single-crystal X-ray
diffractometer (Smart APEX CCD, Bruker AXS). The measurement temperature
of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) was 123 K. The X-ray source was Mo
Kα (wave length: 0.7107 Å). The structure was solved and
refined by Shelx.36 A summary of the present
crystal structure analysis is provided in the Supporting Information.

3 Results
and Discussion
The melting temperatures for aqueous solutions
of the TBA glycolate
with 11 different compositions were measured. The results are shown
in Figure 1 and Table 1. At dilute compositions, x = 0.0027 and 0.0062, the TBA glycolate depressed the freezing
point of ice. As at x = 0.0098, solids in the aqueous
solution melted over 273 K, it is suggested that the TBA glycolate
hydrates are rather more stable than ice at x ≳
0.0098. As x increased the melting temperature increased,
and the highest temperature of 280.9 K was observed at x = 0.0293 and 0.0314. At these compositions the number of water molecules
to one TBA glycolate in the aqueous solutions (Nwater) was 31–33, which is likely to be the hydration
number of the most stable hydrate phase.

In the T–x curve, a peak
shoulder is found between x = 0.005 and 0.015, though
there is a clear peak top at x ≈ 0.03. The T–x curve of the TBA glycolate hydrates
may contain two peaks. This fact suggests that there are two or more
phases of the TBA glycolate hydrates. Such T–x curves were also found in TBA bromide hydrates37 and TBA propionate hydrates.25 TBA bromide hydrates have two phases, that is, tetragonal
and orthorhombic phases, which are stable over the freezing point
of ice.4,37 In Figure 1, the TBA propionate hydrates have a peak shoulder
at around x = 0.01. This is probably due to the several
structures of the TBA propionate hydrates.3

Figure 1 also
compares
the present material with several TBA carboxylate hydrates and TBA
hydroxycarboxylate hydrates, the anions of which are similar to glycolate.
The glycolate is an anion for which the hydroxy group substitutes
the methyl group in propionate, or is attached to acetate. As clearly
shown by this figure, the TBA glycolate has the lowest melting temperatures
among these similar hydrates. The melting temperatures with propionate
and glycolate differ by 10 K, whereas both propionate and glycolate
have a similar molecular structure and volume. This is interesting
because the melting temperature shift with these two anions from TBA
acetate hydrates reflects the opposite effects on stabilization on
the static structure of the hydrates by the hydrophobic methyl group
and hydrophilic hydroxy group.

Figure 2 shows the
single crystals formed at x = 0.0293 and T = 278.2 K. The shape of the crystals was rectangular-columnar.
The DSC measurements were performed on the TBA glycolate hydrates
which was formed from the aqueous solution melted from the single
crystals. We collected the DSC curve three times as shown in Figure 3. Up to ∼275
K, the system temperature was increased with 5 K/min, and for the
higher temperature region the rate of 2 K/min was used. The DSC peaks
agreed with each other between these runs. The heat of fusion of the
TBA glycolate hydrate was determined to be 161 kJ/kg, which is slightly
smaller than those of the other TBA hydroxycarboxylate hydrates: 191
kJ/kg with TBA lactate, 177 kJ/kg with TBA 2HB, and 172 kJ/kg with
TBA 3HB.

In the case of halide anions,
the melting temperature linearly
decreased from F or OH to Cl and Br depending on the volume of the
halide anion.8 The crystal structure changes
from the cubic to the tetragonal and orthorhombic. On the basis of
the typical structures of the TBA salt hydrates,1,2 the
cubic structure has the highest density of the dodecahedral cages
per the number of water molecules: the ratios of water molecules to
the dodecahedral cages are 20 in the cubic structure, 16.4 in the
tetragonal structure, and 12.7 in the orthorhombic structure.38 In the case of linear carboxylate anions, the
hydrate formed with propionate has the highest melting temperature25 with the cubic structure.28 The hydrates with formate, acetate, butyrate, and valerate,
which form the tetragonal structure,28 have
lower melting temperatures than that with propionate. The smallest
one, that is, formate, has the lowest melting temperature among them.
These two cases for halides and linear carboxylates suggest that the
more porous the structure, the lower the melting temperature. The
presently obtained melting temperatures with TBA glycolate are the
lowest between the reported hydrates with hydroxybutyrates. Considering
the relationship between melting temperature and structure, the structure
of the TBA glycolate hydrate is likely to be the most porous among
them. On the other hand, it is reported that the powder XRD analyses
on the TBA carboxylates suggested several structures in the vicinity
of the maximal point on the T–x curve.39,40 Further investigation by single-crystal
XRD is needed for the polymorphic behavior of these semiclathrate
hydrates.

The structure of the TBA glycolate hydrate was determined
to be
a tetragonal cell with 23.4211(9) Å of a lattice
and 12.3114(10) Å of c lattice at 123 K by the
single-crystal XRD. The present hydrate has a unit cell similar to
the TBA lactate hydrate.32 Although the
TBA propionate forms the cubic structure, the glycolate derives the
tetragonal structure. The a lattice with glycolate
is slightly longer than that with 2HB,33 but shorter than that with 3HB.34 It
was found that the unit cell with the TBA lactate and glycolate retains
the usual size of the tetragonal structure, that is, a = 23.5 Å and c = 12.3 Å approximately
,2 whereas the unit cells of the hydrates
with the two hydroxybutyrates, that is, 2HB33 and 3HB,34 are doubled from the usual
size.

Further refinement of the structure found the glycolate
anion in
the water cage, which is highly distorted from regular dodecahedra. Figure 4 shows a pattern
of glycolate hydration in the dodecahedral cage found near the TBA
cation incorporated in the fused cage composed of three tetrakaidekahedral
cages and a pentakaidecahedral cage. A water molecule was found at
the cage center with ∼20% of occupancy. Two oxygen atoms in
the carboxy group formed a five-membered ring by hydrogen bonding
with water molecules. No hydrogen bonds were found between the water
of the dodecahedral cage and one of the oxygens of the carboxy group.
This suggests that the glycolate plays the role of a bridge to link
the network with less hydrogen bonds in the structure, and builds
the relatively porous structure. The presently determined structure
has Nwater = 34 of the hydration number,
which is equivalent to x = 0.029. The highest melting
temperature was obtained around this composition; therefore, the structure
may be reasonably determined.

cage. A five-membered
ring made by water and the carboxy group in the glycolate is together
shown. Red: oxygen in water, magenta: oxygen in glycolate, green:
carbon in glycolate, orange: oxygen in water trapped in the cage.
Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.

Figure 5 compares
the hydration patterns between the lactate and the glycolate anions.
In the case of the lactate,32 the methyl
group in the lactate tends to stay in a wider space available at the
cage center. As a result, both of the oxygen atoms in the carboxy
group make hydrogen bonds with the dodecahedral cage water. Compared
to this case, the glycolate is simply attracted to the cage waters
to bridge them. Alternatively, a water molecule places at the cage
center where the distance from the cage water was a hydrogen bond
length, that is, 2.8–3 Å. This may be because the glycolate
does not have any more hydrophobic parts to prevent the dodecahedral
cage from becoming dented. This preliminarily determined structure
suggests that the anion of which each carbon is modified with hydrophilic
group makes more voids, in other words, a porous structure. Such a
porous structure may cause a lowering of the melting temperature of
the semiclathrate hydrates. That is, the modification of anions by
a hydroxy group is a sort of crystal engineering technique on the
semiclathrate hydrates for controlling the thermodynamic properties.

The present XRD data were insufficient to refine this structure
completely because the structure contains a lot of disorder around
the fused cages composed of tetrakaidecahedral cages which incorporate
the TBA cations. Further structure analysis with the assistance of
spectroscopic methods such as NMR will be needed to reveal the detailed
hydration structure of the glycolate anion.

4 Conclusions
The semiclathrate hydrates of TBA glycolate were formed and subjected
to measurements for thermodynamic properties and a crystal structure
analysis. The melting temperature of the TBA glycolate hydrate was
280.9 K. The heat of fusion was determined to be 161 kJ/kg. The obtained
melting temperatures and the heat of fusion were significantly lower
than those of the previously reported semiclathrate hydrates formed
with hydroxycarboxylates. The structure of the TBA glycolate hydrate
was determined to be of a tetragonal structure as well as those formed
with lactate, 2HB and 3HB. The preliminarily determined structure
suggested that the porous structure of TBA glycolate hydrates may
cause the lowest melting temperatures among the previously reported
hydrates formed with hydroxycarboxylates. The present study showed
that substitution of a hydrophobic group by a hydrophilic group is
an effective method to control thermodynamic properties of semiclathrate
hydrates as well as to improve environmental, biological, and chemical
properties.
