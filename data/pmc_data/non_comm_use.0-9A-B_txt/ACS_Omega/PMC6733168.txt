Size-selected submicron
spheres become very useful building blocks
if the spheres could be synthesized and integrated at any desired
position. In particular, spheres having a similar size to visible-light
wavelength have attracted much attention. Here, we show the synthesis
and assembly of size-selected submicron gold spheres using pulsed
laser ablation of a gold plate in a supercritical fluid. Four findings
were obtained in the study. Submicron spheres with a narrow size distribution
were generated, and the polydispersity was ≈ 6%. The average
diameter was controlled from 600 to 1000 nm. A thermodynamic condition
for scalable synthesis was found. The assembly of spheres onto a metal,
carbon, or plastic substrate was accomplished.

1 Introduction
Nobody
doubts that gold as a material has attracted considerable
attention in chemical and material sciences and industrial applications.1 In particular, gold nanomaterials are utilized
as substrates for single-molecule detection by surface-enhanced Raman
scattering2 and enhanced fluorescence,3 as optomaterials for ultrasensitive biosensors
and medical sensors,4 as catalysts for
chemical reactions such as CO oxidation,5 and as photothermal materials for cancer therapy.6 All of these properties are accomplished by nanomaterials
with a size < 50 nm, which are synthesized by a conventional chemical
synthesis method: reduction of gold (Au) ions in HAuCl4 aqueous solution.7 However, it has been
difficult to produce a size-selected metal particle larger than 100
nm. Specifically, submicron particles could become very useful building
block materials if submicron-sized particles with a homogeneous size
could be synthesized and integrated at any desired position, for example,
photonic crystals matching the visible and near-infrared (NIR) light,
nanogap electrodes with a special smooth surface, field enhancement
driven by high scattering efficiency, and parts of a molecular circuit.

Pulsed laser ablation (PLA), a physical synthesis method, is a
promising approach used to obtain stable nanoparticles. This method
consists of a one-step process conducted at room temperature with
a short duration, for example, a few minutes to an hour.8−14 In addition, scalable synthesis of nanoparticles, several grams/hour
as products, has been recently realized.11d,11e PLA of Au in solution has been extensively investigated in the last
decade.11a,11b Recently, submicron-sized spherical Au particles
were synthesized by PLA.12e,13 We have developed a
novel method for nanoparticle synthesis by conducting PLA in a supercritical
fluid,12a−12f as shown in Figures 1 and S1. Specifically, thermal and dielectric
properties of a surrounding medium can be easily tuned by changing
the fluid density and pressure. Thus, light-emitting silicon nanocrystals
were generated with photoluminescence color (RGB12b and white-light continuum12c) that can be controlled by fluid pressure and/or density during
PLA. The morphology of Au nanoparticles was also changed by the cooling
rate or permittivity of fluids during PLA.12d,12e Furthermore, PLA in a supercritical fluid becomes a popular method
to synthesize various nanomaterials, recently.14

Here, we show submicron Au spheres with a narrow size distribution,
that is, deviations of diameters ranging 5–8%, using PLA laser
synthesis in a supercritical fluid. The average diameter of particles
ranged from 600 to 1000 nm, whose size matches the light wavelength
in the visible and NIR regions. In addition, a thermodynamic condition
for scalable synthesis was found. Furthermore, the integration of
gold spheres onto a metal, carbon, or plastic film was accomplished
and optimized.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of submicron-sized Au spherical particles
generated by PLA at three reduced densities ρr =
ρ/ρc, where ρc is the critical
density, of supercritical trifluoromethane (CHF3) (ρr = 0.7, 1.7, and 1.9). Many submicron-sized spherical Au particles
are generated, and the particle size is very uniform. This phenomenon
has not been observed by PLA in other fluids, for example, CO2 and SF6. The SEM analysis from each sample provided
the average diameter D, of the spherical particles,
and the standard deviation, σ. D ranged over
700–1000 nm: D(ρr = 0.7)
= 890 ± 55 nm, D(ρr = 1.7)
= 710 ± 40 nm, and D(ρr = 1.9)
= 1050 ± 80 nm. Their size distributions are shown in Figure S2.15,16 Here, the plus–minus
values indicate the standard deviation σ from the average diameters,
and the dispersity of particle size is evaluated as the value σ/average.
Note that this dispersity of particle sizes is small and estimated
as 6%, ranging from 5 to 8%. Here, let us discuss the particle size
dependence on the fluid density during PLA, briefly. According to
the transient absorption spectra monitoring PLA in a supercritical
fluid,12f submicron-sized Au particles
are generated within the time shorter than 300 ns after laser irradiation.
Thermodynamic calculations indicated that the generation process is
attributed to the solidification of hot liquid droplets, by which
the lowest surface free energy is obtained with a spherical shape,
within a few 100 ns.12d A cavitation bubble,
in which nanoparticles are generated, emerges within submicroseconds
on the irradiated surface of the target in liquids and high-pressure
liquids, according to time-resolved shadowgraph and light scattering
measurements.17 On the basis of these experimental
evidences in a supercritical fluid and the observations by in situ
time-resolved spectroscopy, it was considered that a concerted process
of evaporation and cooling of Au liquid droplets are responsible for
the particle size. Specifically, the evaporation and cooling rates
of the gold liquid droplet in which the cavitation bubble adiabatically
expands and shrinks in the high-pressure fluid are key factors for
the characterization of the particle size by PLA at high pressures.

Figure 2 SEM images
of submicron spherical Au particles generated by PLA
in supercritical CHF3 at a reduced temperature Tr = T/Tc = 1.02. The Au particles are generated at a reduced density
ρr = ρ/ρc of (a) 0.7, (b)
1.7, and (c) 1.9. Diameter D ranges over 600–1200
nm: (a) D(ρr = 0.7) = 890 ±
55 nm, (b) D(ρr = 1.7) = 710 ±
40 nm, and (c) D(ρr = 1.9) = 1050
± 80 nm. The plus–minus values denote the standard deviation,
σ, from the average diameters. The deviations of particle sizes
are in the 5–8% range of the average diameters.

The amounts of particles produced as a function of fluid
pressure/density
during PLA were investigated. Figure 3a–d shows the typical SEM images of Au spherical
particles fabricated with four representative densities. A significant
dependence on the fluid density is observed; a large amount of gold
nanospheres was generated by PLA at a high fluid density, whereas
that generated at a fluid density lower than ρr =
0.7 was significantly decreased. To quantify the dependence of the
amount of particles on the fluid density, the number of particles
was estimated both for the number density of particles and the particle-deposited
area in the SEM image. Figure 3e shows the number of particles as a function of reduced densities
during PLA. Many particles were generated by PLA at ρr ≥ 0.7, whereas few particles were generated at ρr < 0.7. Thus, Figure 3e reveals that the thresholds of fluid density and
pressure for the generation of particles are ρr =
0.7 and P = 5.3 MPa, respectively. From the Supporting Information, it is noted that many
gold nanonetworks, composed of smaller nanospheres with 30 nm diameter,
are generated by PLA at a lower density of supercritical CHF3 but disappear at a higher density of ρr = 0.7 (Figures S3 and S4). The density for the emergence
of submicron particles is in good agreement with that for the disappearance
of the nanonetworks, that is, liquid gold droplets as precursors are
fragmented to form smaller nanospheres at lower densities giving the
gold nanonetwork, whereas at higher densities, the solidification
of liquid droplets produces submicron-sized particles. This precursor
model of gold liquid droplets has been confirmed by measuring the
amounts/laser pulse of both spherical particles and nanonetworks generated
by PLA in supercritical CO2.12d Briefly, the amount of gold nanonetworks increased, whereas that
of spherical particles with diameter ≅ 800 nm simultaneously
decreased, as the number of laser pulses for PLA was increased. The
density dependence of the amount of spherical particles is attributed
to the branching ratio, which determines whether the liquid gold droplet
solidifies or fragments to the nanonetwork.12e Thus, the threshold density for solidification via cooling was ρr = 0.7.

by PLA
in supercritical CHF3 at a reduced temperature, Tr = T/Tc = 1.02. Particles were fabricated at a reduced density ρr = ρ/ρc of (a) 0.3, (b) 0.7, (c) 0.9,
and (d) 1.9. Corresponding pressures are denoted in the upper axis.
The particles were integrated into the micropores. The number of particles
increases with the fluid density during PLA. (e) Numbers of Au particles
produced at various ρr.

Another distinct feature evident in Figures 3 and S3 is that
almost all the synthesized particles are not present on a flat region
of the substrate but are selectively collected in a pore of size ≈
100 μm on the substrate. Briefly, let us describe the mechanism
of collection of particles into the pore, and the details are given
elsewhere (vide infra). As a first step, particles are synthesized
in supercritical CHF3. In this step, the particles disperse
in the supercritical fluid. As a second step, the pressure of supercritical
CHF3 is decreased to retrieve the synthesized particles
from the high-pressure vessel to the air. In this process, large particles
with the size of 600–1000 nm do not disperse in the gas but
sediment into the liquid region of the substrate, which is located
at the bottom of the vessel. As a third step, all liquid region evaporates
by decreasing further pressure, and the concentration of particle
in the liquid becomes higher. The final liquid involving many spherical
particles drops into a pore, which is located at the lower position
of the substrate.

To further investigate the collection in the
pore, we analyzed
the amounts of particles by preparing a brass substrate with pores
of different depths. Figure 4a,b show the top and side views of the substrate with the
micropores. The pore diameter was set to 300 μm and the depth
ranged from 50 to 1000 μm. The typical cross sections of pores
measured by a laser microscope are also displayed in Figure 4c,d. PLA of a gold plate substrate
in supercritical CHF3 was conducted at a pressure of 5.8
MPa, which corresponds to ρr = 1.25, and the generated
particles in the pores were observed using a scanning electron microscope.
The amount of particles was counted and the results are shown in Figure 4d as a function of
pore depth. These values correspond to the summation of the numbers
of particles synthesized by the experiments performed five times.18 The maximum integration of particles into a
pore is observed when the pore depth is 400 μm. Here, we describe
the integration processes of submicron particles into the pore in
detail (vide supra). Supercritical CHF3 with a pressure
of 5.8 MPa was released to retrieve the substrate from the high-pressure
vessel after the synthesis, during which the fluid temperature decreased
from 305 to 285 K with the adiabatic expansion of the high-pressure
fluid. Thus, the temperature T of CHF3 became lower than the critical temperature19 (Tc = 299.3 K), that is, tentative temperature
≈ 10 °C, so that the supercritical CHF3 became
a liquid. Liquid CHF3 was successively evaporated until
its pressure was equal to the pressure of the atmosphere. These successive
phase transition processes caused liquid CHF3 to settle
at the bottom of the vessel. The final liquid, including many Au particles,
was collected in the pores of the substrate, and many particles were
integrated in the bottom of the pores. Multiple concerted factors,
such as viscosity and surface tension depending on the pressure and
temperature of CHF3, wettability of the substrate, mass
transfer driven by capillary flow,20,21 and pinning
and depinning at the interface between the liquid and the substrate22 can also govern the collection efficiency. Note
that the integration into the pore was also established using the
substrate made of other materials, such as stainless steel (SUS),
copper, carbon, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The data are
displayed in Figure 5. Thus, the pores in these substrates can also collect many submicron
particles.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
nanosecond PLA of an Au plate was conducted in supercritical
CHF3. Many spherical Au particles with diameters from 600
to 1000 nm were synthesized over the threshold density and/or pressure,
that is, ρr = 0.7 and P = 5.3 MPa.
The particle diameter was controlled according to the density and/or
pressure used during PLA, and the polydispersity was as low as 6%.
The selective integration of particles into various substrates was
accomplished by both PLA in a supercritical fluid and successive phase
changes from a high-pressure fluid.

4 Experimental
Section
An instrument to fabricate particles was constructed,
each equipment
of which is illustrated in Figures 1 and S1. A high-pressure
vessel, a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pump, and
a gas cylinder were used to prepare the supercritical state, and optics
with a Q-switched frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser were used to conduct
PLA. The temperature of the fluid in the vessel was controlled using
a set of heaters, a proportional–integral–derivative
controller, and a thermocouple. The pressure of the fluid was increased
with the HPLC pump. The Nd:YAG laser serves as the PLA light source
and was operated at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, an energy
of 19 mJ/pulse, a repetition rate of 20 Hz, a fluence of 0.8 J cm–2, and a pulse width of 8 ns. A gold plate (99.95%,
Tanaka Co.) immersed in supercritical fluid (CHF3, 99.995%)
is irradiated with the laser for 10 min at the isotherm corresponding
to a reduced temperature Tr = T/Tc = 1.02, where Tc is the critical temperature. The pressure for PLA ranged
from 3.81 to 14.9 MPa. The fluid density was calculated from the empirical
equations of state, using the measured values of P and T. The density ranged from 0.158 to 1.00 g
cm–3 and is expressed as 0.3 ≤ ρr = ρ/ρc ≤ 1.9, where ρr and ρc are the reduced and critical densities,
respectively, as shown in Figure S5. The
Au particles generated were deposited on a substrate immersed in supercritical
CHF3, SUS, copper, carbon, and PET. After the sedimentation
of the particles in the fluid, the substrate was retrieved from the
vessel and examined using a field emission scanning electron microscope
(Hitachi N-3400) and a laser microscope (Shimadzu OLS-4000). The sedimentation
time was calculated using the pressure-dependent viscosity of the
fluid12d 1  where vt is the sedimentation velocity depending
on the fluid density, z is the depth, t is the time, ρ
is the density of Au, ρ0 is the fluid density, D is the particle diameter, g is the gravitational
constant, and η is the fluid viscosity depending on the fluid
density. The sedimentation time was adjusted to the amount of time
required for a 100 nm diameter sphere to sink to a depth of 1 cm.
The same sedimentation time was applied to every experiment to prepare
SEM samples for the evaluation of the amount of Au nanoparticles according
to the pressure and/or density during PLA. The critical constant of
CHF3 is reported to be Tc =
299.3 K, Pc = 4.83 MPa, and ρc = 0.527 g cm–3. We represent the density
of CHF3 by the reduced density ρr = ρ/ρc, as shown in Figure S3.

To estimate accurate size
distributions of
particles, we used the particles on the front side on SEM image and
did not use the particles on the back sides, because the particles
in the back side are seen as smaller size than real size, owing to
3-dimensional configuration.

After the synthesis of
Au particles, the
ambient around the particles drastically changes by reducing the fluid
pressure. Under this situation, the depth of pore becomes deeper,
the repeatability of collection of particles becomes higher, as shown
in Figure S6. This is because the spherical
particles at the bottom of the deep pore are insensitive to the ambient
such as strong convection caused by decreasing fluid pressure, whereas
those at shallow pore can detrap from the pore by that convection,
as shown Figure 4c,d.
