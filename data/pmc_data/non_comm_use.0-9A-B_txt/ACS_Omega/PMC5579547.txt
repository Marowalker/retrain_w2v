Although aldehyde oxidase (AO) is
an important hepatic drug-metabolizing
enzyme, it remains understudied and is consequently often overlooked
in preclinical studies, an oversight that has resulted in the failure
of multiple clinical trials. AO’s preclusion to investigation
stems from the following: (1) difficulties synthesizing metabolic
standards due to the chemospecificity and regiospecificity of the
enzyme and (2) significant inherent variability across existing in
vitro systems including liver cytosol, S9 fractions, and primary hepatocytes,
which lack specificity and generate discordant expression and activity
profiles. Here, we describe a practical bacterial biotransformation
system, ecoAO, addressing both issues simultaneously. ecoAO is a cell
paste of MoCo-producing Escherichia coli strain TP1017 expressing human AO. It exhibits specific activity
toward known substrates, zoniporide, 4-trans-(N,N-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde, O6-benzylguanine, and zaleplon; it also has utility as a biocatalyst,
yielding milligram quantities of synthetically challenging metabolite
standards such as 2-oxo-zoniporide. Moreover, ecoAO enables routine
determination of kcat and V/K, which are essential parameters for accurate
in vivo clearance predictions. Furthermore, ecoAO has potential as
a preclinical in vitro screening tool for AO activity, as demonstrated
by its metabolism of 3-aminoquinoline, a previously uncharacterized
substrate. ecoAO promises to provide easy access to metabolites with
the potential to improve pharmacokinetic clearance predictions and
guide drug development.

==== Body
Introduction
Aldehyde oxidase (AO)
belongs to the molybdoflavo-containing family
of enzymes that also includes xanthine oxidase. The AO monomer is
a 148 kDa cytosolic protein and is active as a homodimer.1,2 Each monomer contains four cofactors, MoCo, FAD, and 2[2Fe–2S]
clusters, that contribute to its redox-cycling catalytic mechanism.3 AO exhibits broad substrate specificities, performing
oxidation and/or reduction reactions on an extensive range of endogenous
and exogenous substrates.4 However, only
limited studies have used human enzymes and most results summarized
herein use nonhuman AO. AO oxidizes aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes,
azaheterocycles.5 AO reduces nitro compounds,6−8 sulfoxides,9 azo-dyes,10 N-oxides,7 nitrite,11,12 and molecular oxygen. Although AO plays a significant role in drug
metabolism, the physiological relevance of AO’s endogenous
substrate transformations is not understood. AO constitutes 0.3% of
human hepatocytes by weight (calculated from data published by Barr
et al.),13 where it metabolizes many drugs
and metabolic intermediates. It is also expressed in the intestine,
kidney, lung, adrenal gland, and skin.14−17

The pharmaceutical industry’s trepidation toward AO
has
piqued in recent years as certain AO metabolites have achieved poor
toxicological outcomes in clinical trials,18,19 AO has been implicated in potential drug–drug interactions
(DDI),20,21 and because allometric scaling from AO preclinical
species data consistently underpredicts human AO clearance.22−29 Consequently, promising drug candidates are discontinued every year,
largely because AO metabolism has not been adequately characterized
in existing preclinical in vitro systems. Predominant systems utilized
to screen drug candidates for AO activity include liver cytosol, S9
fractions, and cryopreserved primary hepatocytes.30 All exhibit significant variability that has been attributed
to interindividual phenotypic variability, hypervariable expression,
low stability, and variation in biological fractionation methods.31 Additionally, these systems can suffer from
lack of specificity due to the presence of other mechanistically similar
metabolizing enzymes, including xanthine oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase,
and cytochromes P450.32 Furthermore, most
human liver preparations are contaminated with the AO substrate allopurinol,
which can affect the measured kinetic constants.31 In this publication, we combine MoCo-producing Escherichia coli strain TP1017 (Tracey Palmer Group,
University of Dundee, unpublished) with pTHco-hAOX1, a codon-optimized,
lactose-inducible human AO-containing plasmid33 to produce ecoAO, a standardized cell-paste-based in vitro AO assay
system that is easily implemented by any lab.

AO performs chemoselective
and regioselective redox reactions that
are difficult to reproduce via chemical synthesis. A good example
is the synthesis of 2-oxo-zoniporide, a metabolite of zoniporide requiring
seven synthetic steps (Scheme 1).34 Utilizing the ecoAO system,
we demonstrate biotransformation of known AO-metabolized drugs (zoniporide
to 2-oxo-zoniporide, 4-trans-(N,N-dimethylamino)cinnamaldehyde (DACA) to DACA-acridone,
O6-benzylguanine (O6BG) to 8-oxo-O6BG, and zaleplon to 5-oxo-zaleplon) to produce milligram quantities
of their respective metabolites in just 5 days, with minimal human
intervention (Scheme 2). Furthermore, we provide proof of the concept of ecoAO’s
utility to convert a previously uncharacterized AO substrate, 3-aminoquinoline
(which has proven difficult to synthesize) to its regiospecifically
oxidized metabolite, 2-oxo-3-aminoquinoline (Scheme 3). After solvent extraction and preparative
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the system yields sufficient
product for metabolite quantification, enabling determination of kinetic
parameters, and providing starting materials to synthesize analogues.

Results
Optimizing AO Activity
Over Time by the Direct Expression Culture
Assay
Figure 1 follows AO activity and growth over time in ecoAO expression cultures
grown at 30 °C in aerated spinner flasks using DACA as a probe
substrate. There was a correlation between the growth and activity
for up to 30 h (Pearson r = 0.96 (R2 = 0.92, p < 0.0001), data not shown).
However, after 30 h, the activity and growth no longer showed changes
together. At around 42 h, AO activity, as quantified by DACA oxidation,
peaked before it began to decrease; meanwhile, the E. coli concentration increased (OD600). On the basis of these results, it was determined that ecoAO cultures
should be spun down to cell paste at 42 h and that optical density
was not a reliable indicator of the optimal AO activity. Using the
cell paste that resulted from the optimized expression, we determined
the kinetic parameters, as shown in Figure 2, which depict the saturation kinetics for
0.15 pmol AO (based on the liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) proteomic quantitation described below)
in ecoAO cell paste. Furthermore, we were able to purify AO from the
cell paste using the poly-His tag and determine the kinetic constants
using the purified enzyme. The kinetic parameters obtained are presented
in Table 1.

Biocatalytic
Production of AO Metabolites Using ecoAO
We used the substrate
DACA to optimize the conditions for AO metabolite
formation from cell paste and to test whether other enzymes native
to E. coli would metabolize the substrate.
Briefly, 50 mg/mL cell paste dissolved in AO buffer afforded significant
substrate conversion over 20 h (Figure 3). It can be seen that for each pmol of substrate consumed,
an equivalent amount of metabolite is formed, indicating that no other
metabolite of DACA is being produced in significant amounts. Absolute
AO quantification via LC–MS/MS revealed that 50 mg/mL cell
paste (using the expression conditions outlined in the Methods section) contained 191 ± 7 nM AO.
A control experiment monitoring TP1017 activity with DACA in the absence
of the pTHco-hAOX1 expression plasmid revealed that no metabolite
was formed (Figure 4). Furthermore, inhibitors of AO, raloxifene and hydralazine, significantly
reduced ecoAO activity (Figure 4).

with 200 μM hydralazine (dark gray). Error bars report the SD
of experimental triplicates.

The optimized ecoAO system was employed to biotransform preparative
quantities of several common AO probe substrates to their metabolites.
The substrates (see Scheme 1) were zoniporide (KM = 3.4 μM),23 DACA (KM = 6.3 μM),13 O6BG (KM = 120 μM),35 and zaleplon (KM = 124 μM).36 Furthermore, a previously uncharacterized AO substrate (3-aminoquinoline)
was also evaluated (Scheme 3). Attempts by us to synthesize the metabolite by the method
shown for 5-aminoquinoline in Scheme 1 failed. In general, substrates were incubated with
cell paste and product formation monitored once daily by LC–MS/MS.
When the product formation slowed, the cell paste was removed by centrifugation
and more cell paste was added to the supernatant. The number of rounds
of the addition of fresh ecoAO cell paste required for the reaction
to reach completion was substrate dependent. After purification by
solvent extraction and preparative HPLC, the metabolites were characterized
by NMR (see Supporting Information). The
extinction coefficients for each of the substrates and metabolites
is given in Table 2.

Discussion
Previous
expression systems used large volumes and specialized
equipment. We have developed a system that we call ecoAO for production
of human AO that uses small spinner flasks and stir plates, available
in most labs. The ecoAO system can be utilized to synthesize metabolites,
screen for AO activity, and carry out metabolic studies. In contrast
to other in vitro systems, such as HLC, cryopreserved hepatocytes,
S9 fractions, and purified enzymes, it offers the advantages of being
simple, time-efficient, standardizable, widely applicable, accessible,
economical, and reproducible. Importantly, ecoAO provides researchers
with a tool to characterize AO activity against a nonmammalian background,
ensuring specificity against xanthine oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase,
and P450 activities, as well as any still-uncharacterized contributions
from other mammalian enzymes. Furthermore, HLC can contain different
small molecules (drugs) depending on the donor, or on the preparation,31 which can affect kinetics.

ecoAO Biotransformation
Yields Usable Amounts of Selectively
Oxidized Azaheterocycles
We have provided evidence that ecoAO,
a cell paste made from E. coli expressing
human AO, is a promising new in vitro system for synthesis of AO metabolites
and for the insertion of an oxygen atom adjacent to nitrogen in quinolines,
acridines, and purines. We demonstrated that ecoAO cell paste can
produce sufficient amounts of the metabolites of zoniporide, DACA,
O6BG, and zaleplon for NMR characterization. At least for
DACA, it appears that only the human AO metabolite is formed because
substrate disappearance corresponds directly to the amount of the
product formed (Figure 3). The yields range from 10 to 25% (see Table 2), which is reasonable given that chemical
synthesis of these metabolites requires at least two steps and in
the case of zoniporide replaces a 7-step reaction sequence.

Using an uncharacterized substrate (3-aminoquinoline), we demonstrate
the utility of ecoAO to generate milligram quantities of AO metabolite
from frozen cell paste reconstituted in buffer that can be used as
starting material for the synthesis of more complex molecules. The
biotranformation of 3-aminoquinoline, post-ecoAO 2-oxo-3-aminoquinoline
analogue synthesis (Scheme 3), and ecoAO metabolism of the 3-aminoquinoline analogues,
illustrate two important points: (1) these metabolites could not be
synthesized by the same method as was used for zoniporide (see Scheme 1), although a 4-step
synthesis has been reported37 and (2) even
relatively sterically hindered compounds readily undergo oxidation
adjacent to the nitrogen. From a broader perspective, the ecoAO system
could also be employed in other settings where selective oxidation
of azaheterocycles is desired in a synthesis.

ecoAO Enables Simple Optimization
Expression Conditions for
AO Purification
Although the human AO crystal structure was
solved recently,32 the relationship between
the AO structure and function remains poorly understood. Purified
AO is necessary for its further biophysical characterization, and
bacterial systems are a practical enzyme source; however, low yields
and activities have been reported from bacterial expression systems
in the past.38,39 Low yields may be attributed
to complications associated with E. coli production of AO, for example, poor coexpression of molybdenum-containing
enzymes, large AO (150 kDa) stressing the transcriptional and translational
machinery, and incomplete or incorrect insertion of the four cofactors.40,41 Complete synthesis of the MoCo cofactor requires replacement of
an oxygen atom with sulfur; however, even MoCo-modified E. coli (such as TP1017) is inefficient at this process.42,43 In addition, reports for molybdenum and iron incorporation for expressed
proteins range from 20 to 70% and 45 to 90%, respectively.33,39,40 With many dynamic, complex, little-understood
factors involved in heterologous AO expression, optical density or
total protein quantification alone is not a good measure of AO activity.
Our direct cell-culture DACA assay enables simple AO expression-monitoring
to ensure protein is harvested at maximal activity and consequently
when holoprotein quantity is highest. We have shown that we can purify
human AO from the small batch ecoAO cultures that can be used to further
characterize this enzyme.

How Does ecoAO Compare to Other AO In Vitro
Systems?
The ecoAO cell paste metabolizes DACA with higher
activity per pmol
(kcat value of 24 min–1) of AO than human liver cytosol (HLC) and enzyme purified from the
ecoAO system (Figure 2 and Table 1). The
HLC-derived kcat value for DACA activity
was found to be 6.8 min–1 in this study, with significant
variations observed across batches reported in the literature.13 Enzymes purified from the ecoAO expression system
had kcat of 3 ± 1 min–1 from three separate purifications. Thus, overall, the AO enzyme
in cell paste is slightly more active than in either HLC or purified
protein per nmol of AO.

It is possible that nonspecific binding
in the cell paste could affect the kinetics (KM) of the reaction. If nonspecific binding was significant,
the (KM) value would be predicted to be
higher in cell paste than for purified enzymes. However, the ecoAO
cell paste had KM of 13.7 ± 1.6 μM,
which was not statistically different from KM values for AO activity with DACA that have been reported
as 6.7–8.7 μM and 9.3 μM for HLC and purified enzyme,
respectively (we achieved a very similar KM of 12 ± 2 μM for pure enzyme). However, it should be
noted that at very high levels of cell paste, the reaction appeared
to slow the reaction (data not shown).

ecoAO is a Comprehensive
Platform for the Study AO Metabolism
From a single small-scale
growth of ecoAO, one has the ability
to synthesize significant amounts of metabolite and determine the
in vitro kinetics. Even without extensive purification, the metabolite
can be used to construct a standard curve that can be used to determine
the amount of metabolite by using an NMR internal standard. If the
desired metabolite is one of those produced herein, they can use the
extinction coefficients in Table 2 (data and spectra are given in Supporting Information). However, as we have shown, you can
produce and purify enough metabolites to directly measure the amount.
This is significant in that even people without synthetic experience
can make the metabolite. Without access to the metabolite, one is
forced to use substrate disappearance to determine the in vitro kinetics.
For substrate disappearance to give valid clearance estimates, the
amount of substrate used must be below the KM. However, without the metabolite, it is difficult to know
if these conditions are satisfied.44 Furthermore,
metabolite formation data provides important information concerning
mass balance, time-dependent inhibition, and drug–drug interactions
(DDI). These important clearance-contributing processes are often
not first-order, yet they have only been described to a limited extent
in AO.20,21,35,45 Finally, inaccurate scaling between in vitro and
in vivo clearance data has led to unanticipated rapid first-pass metabolism
in several clinical trials, resulting in their failures.22,24,27 A plausible explanation for AO
clearance underprediction is that AO activity is not constant over
the time of the incubation due to enzyme inhibition and/or inactivation.13 Such kinetic phenomena cannot be identified
by substrate depletion alone.

Conclusions
In
future, we intend to expand the capabilities of the ecoAO system
to address several issues facing the drug development community. For
example, comparing AO activities across preclinical species has proven
problematic due to issues with low activity or loss of activity of
protein purified from heterologous expression systems, hypervariability
of biological fractions, substrate competition with other mammalian
enzymes, and resource-intensive quantification of holoenzymes. By
generating ecoAO cell-paste strains containing active AO isoforms
from various common preclinical species and making them readily available,
we aim to provide a comprehensive, standardized platform for in vitro
preclinical evaluation of AO. Furthermore, genotypic variability of
AO has also been associated with altered drug metabolism phenotypes.39 Our human ecoAO strain is readily modifiable
so that any AO genotype may be assessed for expression and activity.

In conclusion, the ecoAO system provides researchers with a new
tool to characterize the role of AO in drug metabolism, addressing
many of the established issues in other in vitro systems. Furthermore,
it is well suited to high-throughput implementation for screening
drug candidates for AO activity, producing AO metabolites, and performing
metabolic studies.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
lactose-inducible TP1017 E. coli strain
(as JM101/Δ mobAB::Kan; unpublished) was a
gift from Tracey Palmer of the University
of Dundee. E. coli codon-optimized
human AO-containing plasmid pTHco-hAOX1 was the expression vector.33 All E. coli expression
media components were obtained from Sigma. Human liver cytosol (HLC),
pooled from 50 individual donors (male and female), was purchased
from XenoTech (Batch H06610.C Lot no. 141002, Lenexa, KS). DACA was
synthesized using a method described previously13 with some revisions (described in Supporting Information). DACA-acridone hydrochloride was a gift from William
Denny, University of Auckland. O6BG was purchased from
Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Toronto, Canada). Raloxifene hydrochloride
was obtained from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY). Zoniporide
hydrochloride hydrate, zaleplon, allopurinol, hydralazine, acetic
anhydride, and internal standards 2-methyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone
and phenacetin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
3-Aminoquinoline and 4-methylvaleric acid chloride were purchased
from TCI America (Portland, OR).

Methods
AO Expression
System
TP1017-competent cells were transformed
with pTHco-hAOX1 and stored at −80 °C as 20% glycerol
stocks. When required, the stock was cultured on an agar plate and
a single ampicillin-resistant colony was used to inoculate Complete
Luria Broth (LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 0.25
μL/mL Trace Element solution, 0.2 mM sodium molybdate, and 1
μg/mL riboflavin).3 The starter culture
was shaken overnight at 37 °C and diluted by 1:100 to inoculate
Complete Terrific Broth,46 with identical
supplementation to Complete LB (described above). The culture was
grown at 30 °C, shaking at 220 rpm until OD600 = 0.7
(UV–vis), at which time AO expression was induced by addition
of 5 mg/mL lactose dissolved in minimal double-distilled H2O. After induction, the culture was divided into 200 mL aliquots
and transferred to 250 mL spinner flasks at 30 °C (spinning at
120 rpm), supplemented with filtered (50 mm, 0.2 μm, PFTE (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA)) air bubbled in via a submerged
glass tube (airflow was maintained at 4 scfh by a Dwyer RMB-51 flow-meter).

Direct Assay of TP1017(pTHco-hAOX1) Expression Culture Using
DACA
Aliquots of 1 mL were removed from the expression culture
and spun down at 1000g for 3 min. The supernatant
was decanted off, and the pellet of intact E. coli cells was resuspended in 200 μL of prewarmed (37 °C)
AO buffer (25 mM KPi (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid). The assay was initiated by addition of 37 μM DACA in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (0.5% v/v) and allowed to run at 37 °C
for 5 min. The reaction was quenched with 50 μL of 1 M formic
acid containing a known amount of 2-methyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone
as an internal standard (IS) and centrifuged at 16 100g for 10 min. DACA-acridone was quantified in the supernatant
against IS using LC–MS/MS.

Purification, Quantitation,
and DACA Saturation Kinetics of
Pure AO and ecoAO
His-tagged AO was purified from the ecoAO
expression culture according to a previously described method;38 additionally, the protein was further purified
via anion exchange using the AKTA system with a Mono Q column (GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA; buffer A: 25 mM KPi (pH 7.4);
buffer B: 25 mM KPi (pH 7.4) + 2 M NaCl). Protein was eluted
at 15% buffer B. Total AO concentration in the ecoAO cell paste, purified
AO, and human liver cytosol was quantified via LC–MS/MS using
a previously described method.13 DACA saturation
kinetics were performed using 0.15 pmol AO (ecoAO), 1.9 pmol purified
AO, and 0.51 pmol human liver cytosol.

Bioanalytics of AO Substrate
Biotransformation Using ecoAO
Samples were analyzed using
the LC-20AD series HPLC system (Shimadzu,
Columbia, MD) fitted with an HTC PAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies,
Carrboro, NC). Chromatography was performed on a Luna C18 column (50 x 2.0 mm2, 5 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase
A consisted of 0.05% formic acid and 0.2% acetic acid in water and
the mobile phase B comprised 90% acetonitrile, 9.9% water, and 0.1%
formic acid. The column was equilibrated with 90% mobile phase A (600
μL/min). Column elution was achieved using a linear gradient
to 25% mobile phase A. Quantitation was conducted using an API 4000
Q-Trap tandem mass spectrometry system (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex,
Foster City, CA), with turbospray electrospray ionization operating
in positive-ion mode. The tune parameters used were as follows: collision
gas, medium; declustering potential, 70; entrance potential, 10; collision
energy, 25; collision cell exit potential, 15; curtain gas, 20; ion
spray voltage, 5500; ion source gas 1, 60; ion source gas 2, 40; and
desolvation temperature, 400. Substrates and metabolites were quantified
against IS using multiple reaction monitoring to monitor the following m/z transitions: zoniporide, 321 →
262; 2-oxo-zoniporide, 337 → 278;23 DACA, 295.2 → 250.2; DACA-acridone, 310.2 → 265.0;13 O6BG, 242.2 → 199.1; 8-oxo-O6BG, 258.2 → 91;35 zaleplon,
306.1 → 236.1; 5-oxo-zaleplon, 322.3 → 280.1;30 2-oxo-3-aminoquinoline 161.2 → 143.2; N-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)acetamide 203.1 →
185.1, 4-methyl-N-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)pentanamide
259.1 → 241, and the internal standards (IS) were either 2-methyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone 161.0 → 120.0 or phenacetin 180.2
→ 110.1, as specified.

Substrate Disappearance,
Product Formation, and Control Experiments
Biotransformation
of 10 μM DACA was monitored over 24 h to
provide kinetic data for substrate depletion and metabolite (DACA-acridone)
formation. Non-AO expressing E. coli (no pTHco-hAOX1 plasmid) and inhibitors (10 μM raloxifene47 and 30 min preincubation of 200 μM hydralazine48) were used as negative controls. For each assay,
the resuspended cell paste (50 mg/mL, wet weight) was prewarmed to
37 °C and 10 μM substrate was used to initiate the reaction
(500 μL of final volume). Catalysis was quenched with 125 μL
of 1 M formic acid containing a known amount of the internal standard
and centrifuged at 16 100g for 10 min. Both
compounds were quantified in the supernatant using LC–MS/MS.13 The activity was reported as percent conversion
after 24 h.

Preparative Scale Biotransformation Using
ecoAO Cell Paste
Frozen cell paste was thawed at room temperature
(rt) and resuspended
in 20 mL (50 mg/mL) of AO buffer (pH 7.4) in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
The cell paste suspension was prewarmed for 5 min (37 °C); then,
100 μL of the substrate (zoniporide, 2 mg; DACA, 4 mg; zaleplon,
2 mg; O6BG, 2 mg) dissolved in DMSO was added. The incubation
was performed at 37 °C with replacement of cell paste when substrate
conversion slowed, as monitored by LC–MS/MS. Once the reaction
had advanced to completion (about 5 days), the cells were spun down
at 30 000g for 20 min. The supernatant was
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was collected and
concentrated in vacuo. Further purification was performed on an Accela
ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA) with a 4.60 × 250 mm2 Luna 5 μm
C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Mobile phases A and B were
identical to those used for mass spectrometry. The column was equilibrated
with 90% mobile phase A (4.0 min; 800 μL/min). Chromatographic
separation was achieved using a linear gradient for over 13 min to
0% mobile phase A. The purified metabolites were identified using
LC–MS/MS and proton NMR. NMR spectra (see Supporting Information) were recorded using a Varian 600 MHz
spectrometer.

Synthesis of N-(2-Oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)acetamide,
4-Methyl-N-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)pentanamide,
and 3-(Dimethylamino)-N-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)propanamide
The crude 2-oxo-3-aminoquinoline incubation mixture from the preparative
biotransformation (20 mg by LC–MS/MS) was added with excess
amount of either the anhydride or acid chloride of the desired analogue
(Scheme 3). It was
stirred at rt for 12 h. The crude reaction mixture is added with Na2CO3 and extracted with ethyl acetate (50 ×
2 mL). The ethyl acetate layer is washed with 50 mL of brine solution
and concentrated in vacuo. The amount and purity of the compounds
were characterized by qNMR.

Data Analysis
Experimental data were processed and
analyzed using a GraphPad Prism (version 7.0a; GraphPad Software Inc.,
San Diego, CA).
