Mass
transfer processes are one of the most important operations
in chemical, biochemical, and food industries worldwide. In the processes
that are controlled by the gas–liquid mass transfer rate, the
volumetric mass transfer coefficient kLa becomes a crucial quantity. The dataset was measured
with the aim to create a correlation for kLa prediction in a non-coalescent batch under the
wide range of experimental conditions. The dynamic pressure method,
which was reported as physically correct in the past, was chosen to
be the method for experimental determination of kLa. Our previous work targeted the kLa dependencies in viscous
and coalescent batches resulting in correlations that are viable for
the broad range of process conditions. We reported that the best-fit
correlation is based on the hydrodynamic parameter circumferential
velocity of impeller blades in the case of non-coalescent liquids
in the vessel equipped by single or multiple impellers at a constant D/T ratio (diameter of the impeller to
the inner diameter of the tank). Now, we focus on the influence of
various impeller diameters on transport characteristics (mainly kLa) in a non-coalescent batch.
The experiments are carried out in a multiple-impeller vessel equipped
with Rushton turbines (of four diameters) and in both laboratory and
pilot-plant scales. Various impeller frequencies and gas flow rates
are used. We examine the suitability of the hydrodynamic description,
which was reported in the past, to predict kLa also when the D/T ratio changes. We show that the correlation based on the
energy dissipation rate better fits the experimental data and predicts kLa values more accurately in
the case of varying D/T values.
This correlation could be adopted in the design and scale-up of agitated
devices operating with non-coalescent batches.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The necessity to optimize
gas–liquid mass transfer rises
many times in chemical, biochemical, and food industries. The mass
transfer operations are often carried out in mechanically or pneumatically
agitated contactors with the preference of mechanically agitated ones
due to their ability to easily vary operational conditions. The mechanically
agitated contactors are adopted under a wide range of operational
conditions in fermentation, hydrogenation, chlorination, and many
other mass transfer processes. To optimize the contactor performance,
various impeller types are used to optimize the flow pattern. The
most significant limitation to the utilization of mechanically agitated
gas–liquid contactors is the uncertainty in their design. The
contactors are commonly designed on the basis of empirical correlations,
which are assumed to be built on correct experimental data. As will
be discussed below, many experimental techniques to obtain kLa reported in the literature
for several decades have, unfortunately, proved to produce erroneous
data by multiples. Due to the lack of newer kLa data, inaccurate correlations are still
used.

Also, the appropriate design through the first-principle-based
chemical engineering data cannot be utilized due to the complexity
of transport phenomena in mechanically agitated gas–liquid
dispersions, as will also be discussed further. Therefore, experimental
research of mass transfer characteristics is a crucial task, and physically
correct data on the volumetric mass transfer coefficient, kLa, are needed to design the
processes where the gas–liquid mass transfer becomes the rate-controlling
step.

Because of the well-known fact that no single kLa correlation can describe
the data
from all batches (see, e.g., Markopoulos et al.1), it was suggested by Zlokarnik2 to split gas–liquid systems into coalescent and non-coalescent
ones. This suggestion was made on the basis of different bubble interactions
in the observed systems. The differences in bubble interactions significantly
affect the kLa values,3 and the transition between coalescent and non-coalescent
behavior is sharp.4,5 Even though the differences between
coalescent and non-coalescent batches were studied by multiple researchers,
the phenomenon has not been fully understood so far, and the heuristic
division into these categories remains the most reliable way.

The complexity of hydrodynamic conditions in gas–liquid
contactors is a reason why the theoretical prediction is not a common
approach. Some CFD simulation studies on this topic have been published
and overviewed by Ranganathan.6 The overview
led to the conclusion that, to be able to compute the CFD model, significant
simplifications had to be made, and therefore, the model was not able
to describe the studied system for a sufficiently wide range of process
conditions.

For the experimental determination of kLa, various methods (dynamic pressure
method, steady-state
sulfite method, and others) have been developed in the course of years.
After testing,7−9 the dynamic pressure method, DPM, has been established
as the best method, which can even measure high kLa values correctly. Unfortunately, most
of the literature data for the non-coalescent batch was measured by
methods that significantly underestimate the kLa at high absorption rates (kLa > 0.2 s–1) and
therefore
has no apparent physical meaning.10 The
literature offers many correlation shapes for kLa prediction, which are based on experimental
data, but, in addition, a significant amount of those was measured
only in a specific configuration and has not been verified for various
liquids, vessel sizes, and multiple-impeller vessels. In general,
the design of industrial-scale equipment according to literature correlations
is still uncertain.2,11 In our previous work, we focused
on kLa prediction for
gas–liquid contactors equipped with Rushton turbines in the
viscous batch12,13 and coalescent batch (water).14 In this work, we target the prediction of kLa for the non-coalescent batch,
and, in addition, introducing a new parameter studied, various impeller
diameters. The effect of impeller diameters will be investigated using
Rushton turbines at four various D/T values in single, double, and triple impeller configurations.

The resulting correlation for kLa prediction in non-coalescent gas–liquid contactors
will be established on the basis of the extensive experimental dataset,
and its reliability will be verified.

2 Theory
The specialized literature offers kLa correlations based on different quantities. One
of the standardly used descriptions is based on the theory of isotropic
turbulence.15 In this category, the basic
correlation shape, frequently used in the literature, has the following
form: 1  

The constants C1, C2, and C3 vary from author
to author. The correlations published to predict kLa values in the non-coalescent batch
mixed by Rushton turbines are listed in Table 1.

4.17 × 10–4 (Pg/V)1.17vs0.34	3 RT	Na2SO4	0.5 M	0.6 m	Linek10	
It
is worth noting that the values of constant C2 significantly differ in Table 1. The reason for such significant differences
among published data are various measurement methods. The kLa was measured using various
experimental techniques; many of which produce kLa values distorted by a disagreement between
the mathematical model and physical reality in experiments.20 The analysis of particular phenomena in individual
experimental techniques showed that, in various experimental techniques,
another phenomenon controls the interfacial mass transfer rate rather
than the one assumed in the evaluation model. As one example for all,
let us mention the mass transfer rate controlled by gas holdup residence
time instead of the volumetric mass transfer coefficient as described
by Linek.7 Most of the correlations quoted
in Table 1 are not
reliable for industrial design and scale-up owing to only one size
of the experimental apparatus.2

One
way to refine kLa predictions
was the inclusion of the energy dissipated by gas bubbles
expansion in the batch as presented, for example, by Labík
et al.21 The total power input, PTOT, could be then calculated using the additional
term to the impeller power: 2  

Labík et al.21 created and tested
several new dimensional correlations. Some of the correlations involved
the impeller tip speed term (ND) or the impeller
power number (P0), which stands for specifics
in impeller mixing patterns and can be calculated as 3  

The second fairly popular option
of how to describe kLa is dimensionless equations. Due to
the physical differences in the batch behavior, the split into dimensionless
equations for coalescent and non-coalescent batches is kept. This
approach is necessary until the coalescent and non-coalescent behavior
would be examined and fully understood.2 Moucha et al.20 showed that the impeller
tip speed is better for kLa prediction in the non-coalescent batch than the gassed power input
when the data obtained by various impellers are correlated. Labík
et al.21 provided another set of experimental
data that supported this conclusion and presented the suitable correlation
for kLa prediction in
the non-coalescent batch on the basis of the robust experimental dataset.
This conclusion was, however, made using the only single value of
the impeller to the tank diameter ratio, D/T = 1/3.

In the frame of this work, we aim to test
literature kLa correlations
or, alternatively, establish
another one to develop the reliable tool for gas–liquid contactor
design also in the cases of D/T ratios
significantly different from 1/3. For this purpose, we selected both
dimensional and dimensionless literature correlations as they are
given in Table 2.

3 Results
and Discussion
First of all, correlation 1 was fitted to the measured data and compared
with literature-based
correlations given in Table 1. The results are depicted in Figure 1. The fitted correlation shape has the following
form:  

Figure 1 Comparison
of predicted kLa data
on the basis of correlation 4 with literature ones.

Even though our correlation roughly corresponds with the data presented
in the literature, Figure 2 shows that its shape (correlation 1) is not suited for kLa prediction for devices of different sizes.
Predicted data for the smaller vessel (T29) are significantly underestimated
in comparison to the measured data. On the other hand, when T is kept constant, correlation shape 1 is able to predict kLa values regardless of the D/T ratio because the data for the T59
vessel where various D/T values
were used are concentrated into one cluster, that is, they are not
separated according to D values. The results obtained
from fitting parameters to correlation 4 (Figure 3) give almost identical results like the ones presented for correlation 1. It means that
the involvement of the energy dissipated by gas bubble expansion is
not significant, even though, at low impeller speeds, gas expansion
contributes to the total energy dissipated by tens of percent.

on the basis of correlation 4 and measured data for two different vessel sizes and
various impeller diameters.

Figure 3 Comparison
of predicted kLa data
on the basis of correlation 4 and measured data for two different vessel sizes and
various impeller diameters.

In the case of correlation shape 4, the predicted data for the
T29 vessel are also underestimated in comparison to the measured data.
Due to this inconsistency, correlation 5 based on the circumferential velocity of impeller
blades reported by Moucha et al.20 and
Labík et al.21 was tested; the result
of which is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Comparison of predicted kLa data on the basis of correlation 4 and measured data for two different vessel sizes and
various impeller diameters.

Figure 4 shows that
the relative standard deviation, RSD, increased in correlation 5. The predicted data for
T29 are again underestimated, and therefore, it could be concluded
that correlation 5 is
not able to predict kLa in a vessel equipped with impellers of various D/T ratios in a non-coalescent batch.

Further, Figures 5–7 show how the
dimensionless correlations 6–8, respectively, described our
experimental data.

two different vessel
sizes and various impeller diameters.

on the basis of dimensionless correlation 7 and measured data for two different vessel
sizes and various impeller diameters.

Figure 7 Comparison
of predicted kLa data
on the basis of dimensionless correlation 8 and measured data for two different vessel
sizes and various impeller diameters.

From the comparison of individual correlations’ closeness,
we can see a more precise kLa prediction in the dependence on the energy dissipated in the batch
(correlation 6 in Figure 5) than the prediction
based on the circumferential velocity of impeller blades (correlations 7 and 8 in Figures 6 and 7, respectively). This finding
differs from that made by Moucha et al.20 and Labík et al.21 It is necessary
to stress that the findings by Moucha et al.20 and Labík et al.21 resulted from
the data measured only for D/T =
1/3. In their case, more uniform circulation loop velocities were
achieved, which corresponded with similar gas holdup values and through
the interfacial area values and also with similar kLa values. Here, when the impeller diameter
varies, significantly different fractions of bubbles are engaged into
recirculation loops at similar dissipation intensities, and the kLa prediction based on ND is not the optimal one.

Further statistical data
related to correlation 6 are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3 Statistical Data Describing Correlation 6 Coefficients
constant	value	p value	lower 95% confidence limit	upper 95% confidence limit	
C1	0.0187	2.61 × 10–12	0.0107	0.0330	
C2	1.05	1.40 × 10–189	1.02	1.08	
C3	0.506	5.69 × 10–52	0.453	0.558	
Even though correlation 6 provides the best results in terms of RSD, the data
from
smaller scales seem to differ systematically. To check the correctness
of the correlation, we decide to fit the data from laboratory and
pilot plant scales separately. Obtained results were used for t-tests
of separated datasets with the confidence limit set to 95%. The value
of calculated t = 1.645 is lower than tcritical,0.975 = 1.96 and therefore not statistically
significant with 95% confidence. We can correlate both datasets altogether.

4 Conclusions
In the frame of long-term research of transport
characteristics
in mechanically agitated dispersions, the new aspect was described
for non-coalescent batches, the variation in the D/T ratio. The new aspect also brought the new conclusion
about the best correlation shape to predict kLa data for scaling up purposes. In the case
of different D/T values, the kLa prediction based on the
circumferential velocity of impeller blades did not prove to be better,
as it was previously reported in the case of a constant D/T. Even if similar ND values are
set using the impellers of different diameters, the recirculation
loops’ length is different, and the liquid flowing out of the
impeller spills into a larger cross-sectional area, reducing the recirculation
loop’s velocity. Also, the energy dissipation intensity varies
significantly, when the same ND value is set using
various D/T values. This work leads
us to the conclusion that, in the cases where the D/T values varied in non-coalescent batches, the
best employable correlation in the fermenter design proved to be the
dimensionless one suggested by Zlokarnik.23 9  which can
be explained as
follows. Using different impeller diameters, at a single energy dissipation
intensity, we reach different velocities in the impeller recirculation
loops, which means different magnitudes of the drag force engaging
gas bubbles into the recirculation. The equilibrium between the drag
forces and buoyancy forces determines the amount of bubbles engaged.
This affects kLa values
and is described by the ratio of energy dissipation intensity Pg/V and drag forces against
buoyancy vg, which is used in Zlokarnik’s
correlation. Further reason for better prediction using Zlokarnik’s
correlation can lie in the fact that Q/V better corresponds with the mean gas residence time, that is, also
with the gas holdup, which is similar in the vessels of different
scales at the same Q/V. Nevertheless,
varying recirculation-loop velocity also slightly changes mass transfer
intensities, which is seen in slightly different trends in the data
of various diameters. Even under these circumstances, we recommend
the usage of correlation 6 because of the acceptably low relative deviation from the viewpoint
of industrial design.

5 Materials and Methods
The experimental setup and measurement techniques were already
described in depth in our previous work.25,26 The experiments were performed in two different vessel sizes: the
laboratory-scale one with the inner diameter of the vessel, T, equal to 0.29 m and the pilot plant-scale one with T equal to 0.59 m. Each of the vessels contained four baffles
with a thickness equal to T/10 that means 0.029 m
in the case of a laboratory vessel and 0.059 m in the case of a pilot
plant scale vessel. Single, double, or triple impellers were gradually
used. The impeller diameter, D, used in the laboratory
scale vessel was 0.1 m, which corresponds to the D/T ratio equal to 0.33. In the pilot plant, the
four different diameters of impellers were used. The sizes of employed
impellers were 0.15 m (D/T = 0.25),
0.2 m (D/T = 0.33), 0.24 m (D/T = 0.4), and 0.27 m (D/T = 0.46). The inter-impeller clearance was always
equal to T; therefore, each impeller region (section)
height was equal to the tank diameter. The liquid volume was 18.3
L in each section of the laboratory vessel and 153 L in each section
of the pilot-plant vessel. The schemes of both apparatuses are depicted
in our previous publications.25,26 The major difference
between the apparatuses of both sizes lies in the dish-shaped pilot-plant
bottom in contradiction to the flat-shaped laboratory bottom.

The dynamic pressure method, DPM, was employed to measure kLa. The pressure change in
the vessel was approximately 15 kPa. The pressure time profile as
well as that of the oxygen concentration was monitored and recorded.

The evaluated kLa is
calculated as the average value of individual kLa values measured in each impeller region.
The average kLa is more
accurate and able to better describe mass transfer in the vessel as
a whole. The same approach to experimental data treatment was adopted
and recommended by Fujasová.19 The
accuracy of the established correlations for further data prediction
was quantified by relative standard deviation, RSD, between experimental
values of kLa and the
predicted ones.

The batch temperature was set to 20 ± 0.1
°C. Superficial
gas velocities during measurements in both vessels were set at 0.00212,
0.00424, and 0.00848 m s–1, respectively. Impeller
mixing frequencies differed from 250 to 850 rpm in the laboratory
scale and from 100 to 1000 rpm in the pilot plant-scale vessel.

The experimental batch was a 0.5 M aqueous solution of Na2SO4 that exhibits non-coalescent behavior. The physical
properties of the batch that were used for evaluation are listed in Table 4. The diffusivity
was measured by the polarographic oxygen probe according to the method
described by Elgozali.27 For the viscosity
measurement, a rotational rheometer was employed, and finally, for
measurements of surface tension, the Du Noüy ring method was
applied.
