TiO2 anatase has emerged as a promising anode for Na-ion
batteries (SIBs). However, widespread use of this anode is severely
limited by a series of factors that need to be identified and understood
to further improve their electrochemical response. Here, we have taken
benefit from the versatility of a self-assembly seeding-assisted method
to obtain a variety of uniform high-surface-area undoped TiO2 anatase nanostructures. Electrodes built from these uniform nanostructures
in combination with a safe ionic liquid electrolyte have allowed a
systematic study on some of the factors that determine the electrochemical
activity of Na-ion anatase anodes. Interestingly, the inherent low
penetrability of the ionic liquid electrolyte has resulted in an unexpected
asset to clarify large differences in Na+ uptake by different
nanostructures. Basically, solid electrolyte interface (SEI) effects
were maximized and therefore clearly separated from electrochemical
reactions strictly associated with the anatase anode. Thus, for electrodes
built from nanostructures that preserved their initial conformation
after cycling, the first discharge showed Na+ uptakes well-beyond
those of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple. This large
uptake has been associated with an apparent reversible reaction that
operates below ca. 0.5–0.7 V and an irreversible mechanism
that operates at lower voltages (ca. 0.3 V). However, for electrodes
built from nanostructures that favored SEI formation, the irreversible
reaction associated with the plateau at ca. 0.3 V was not observed
during the first discharge. In accordance, the total Na+ uptake did not reach values beyond those of the corresponding Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple. Irreversibility, in this case,
is associated with SEI formation. Our results also establish the strong
effect that size at different scale levels has in the electrochemical
response of anatase anodes for SIBs (changes from ca. 6 to 11 nm in
crystal sizes and from 50 to 80 in nanostructure sizes led to pronounced
differences). This result emphasizes that any conclusions on mechanistic
studies other than size effects must be done under strict control
on size at various scales (size as a strict control variable at crystal
level and nanostructure or in more general terms aggregate scale levels).
Finally, we have found that at 30 and 60 °C the performance of
the best of the electrodes, with the low-flammable and low-volatile
ionic liquid electrolyte, is comparable to that of similar nanostructures
immersed in their Li-ion electrolyte counterparts. This result is
promising, as in stationary applications where SIBs could replace
Li-ion batteries, large accumulation of storage components imposes
more strict safety criteria. Basically, power criteria can be relaxed
in response to more strict safety criteria.

Introduction
Na-ion batteries (SIBs)
are being explored as a possible alternative
to Li-ion batteries (LIBs).1 Sodium reserves
are abundant and importantly widely spread, whereas lithium is scarce
and localized in remote or conflictive areas. Furthermore, unlike
lithium, sodium does not form an alloy with aluminum, enabling the
use of this metal as a current collector.2 However, Na-ions are heavier than Li-ions and significantly larger
in size (102 vs 76 pm). Thus, one could expect that electrodes active
to both Li- and Na-ions show on average a poorer performance for Na-ions.
These straightforward arguments suggest that SIBs could replace LIBs
in stationary applications.

To a certain extent, there has been
relative success in obtaining
cathodes for SIBs with good stability using inexpensive raw materials.3 Furthermore, there are now examples of cathodes
showing excellent rate capabilities.4 Thus,
and regarding electrode materials, the development of SIBs greatly
depends on the development of adequate negative electrodes.5 Studies on different TiO2 polymorphs
have demonstrated their capabilities as a potential negative electrode.5−43 More specifically, substantial and significant reports have shown
the relatively good capabilities of the TiO2 anatase polymorph
as anodes for SIBs.6,16−18,20−43 These anodes, working at a relatively low average potential versus
Na/Na+, could assure at least acceptable energy density
using an abundant material. A summary of some of the characteristics
of anatase anodes reported earlier is shown in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information). For example, a
common characteristic of these anodes is the irreversibility observed
after the first discharge curve, specially manifested at slow rates
where all possible electrochemical processes are active. The source
of this irreversibility and, in general, the mechanism of sodiation/desodiation
by anatase anodes are still a matter of continuous research.16−18 Recent studies indicate that in anatase, insertion of 1 Na+ is feasible, leading to the formation of a highly disordered phase
(layered-like rhombohedral R3̅m structure).17 Upon desodiation, this
structure seems to reverse to a structure similar to anatase but with
additional amorphization.17 Interestingly,
in this study, the total uptake during the first discharge was about
1.1 Na+, relatively close to that from the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple. However, values well-beyond 1 Na+ have been reported during the first discharge, especially
when working with nanosize doped anatases (see Table S1).6,16,20−23,25,28,29,31,32,35,39,40,42 These high values (even uptakes of 3.5 Na+ are reported)
suggest that in addition to an insertion mechanism other mechanisms
could also be operative, such as the conversion reaction proposed
by Passerini and co-workers.16,18 However, the activity
of these anodes takes place below 1 V versus Na/Na+, where
solid electrolyte interfaces (SEIs) are formed.16,17,44−46 Obviously, as Na+ uptake values well-beyond those of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple are linked to the electrodes built from nanosized
anatases, there is always uncertainty on the contribution of SEIs
during the first cycles (especially the first discharge). Furthermore,
SEIs in SIBs show in general lower stability than that of their Li-ion
counterparts.44,47 In addition, the carbon (doping
and additives) in SIBs is known to contribute to SEI formation.48 Interestingly, a survey of the literature (see Table S1) shows that high Na+ uptake
values are common in nanosized anatases during the first discharge
irrespective of the electrolyte (NaPF6 or NaClO4 dissolved in different organic carbonate mixtures and even ionic
liquids).

As the interest in SIBs is relatively recent, most
of the studies
(including anatase anodes) have been done using organic carbonate
electrolytes. In fact, electrolyte optimization in SIBs is still in
its infancy stages.49 Organic carbonates
raise safety concerns associated with flammability, volatility, and
overall degradability above 50 °C.50−52 Safety is a primary
concern in stationary applications where large accumulation of storage/delivery
components imposes more strict criteria for safety. As SIBs are intended
for stationary applications, it seems rather logic to assume that
safety concerns could be a limiting factor for the future applicability
of SIBs. Aprotic ionic liquids, such as those based on pyrrolidinium,
represent a safe alternative to organic carbonates in LIBs.50,53−56 However, widespread use of ionic liquid electrolytes in batteries
is currently hampered by slow diffusion of active ions.50,51,53−57 Thus, current possible applications of ionic liquids
in batteries must be limited to those in which power criteria can
be relaxed in response to more strict safety criteria. As mentioned
above, SIBs are intended for stationary applications, and in this
direction, Na-ion-based ionic liquid electrolytes could certainly
become competitive when compared to their Li-ion counterparts. Studies
on ionic liquid electrolytes have been scarce. Up to our knowledge,
there are only a few studies on the behavior of anatases in sodium
metal half-cells with ionic liquids. Hagiwara et al.39 reported the high rate capability and good cycling performance
of carbon-coated anatase TiO2 nanopowders using [FSA]-[C3C1pyr][FSA] as electrolyte. However, working temperatures
were around 90 °C (close to the melting point of Na metal). Perhaps,
the more comparable study was that carried out with Pyr13FSI-NaFSI, which shows an acceptable performance at room temperature
(RT).43 However, in that study, the characterization
was limited to only one commercial sample, the carbon additive was
set to 20 wt % (could contribute to SEI formation), and the specific
capacity did not reach values during the first discharge well-beyond
those of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple (ca. 370
mAh/g or 1.1 Na+). Herein, we have taken benefit from the
versatility of a self-assembly seeding-assisted method to obtain a
variety of uniform high-surface-area undoped TiO2 anatase
nanostructures that differ in crystal size or nanostructure size.
Electrodes built from these uniform nanostructures and with only a
10 wt % carbon additive were used as negative electrodes in sodium
half-cells using Pyr14TFSI–NaTFSI as the ionic liquid
electrolyte. Selection of this electrolyte was based on the fact that
Pyr14TFSI is a relatively stable and affordable commercial
ionic liquid, which also allows a direct comparison with similar nanostructures
immersed in their Li-ion counterparts. Interestingly, the inherent
low penetrability of the ionic liquid electrolyte has resulted in
an unexpected asset to clarify large differences in Na+ uptake by different nanostructures. Essentially, SEI effects were
maximized and therefore clearly separated from electrochemical processes
strictly associated with the anatase anodes.

Results and Discussion
Structural
and Textural Characterization
Figure 1 (Figures S1–S3 for a better visualization of high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) features) shows that all
samples consist of uniform colloidal nanostructures built, according
to HR-TEM, by more or less aligned anatase nanocrystals, exposing
a majority of (101) surfaces. Recent studies on anatase anodes in
SIBs have shown a dependence of the electrochemical response on the
exposed surface.5 Thus, exposing a majority
of (101) surfaces assures excluding this factor from affecting the
electrochemical activity. More specifically, the XRD for A6-50 shows
peaks only corresponding to anatase (Figure 1). The crystal size using the Scherrer equation
(Table 1) gives a value
of ca. 6 nm (similar to that inferred from the HR-TEM showed in Figures 1 and S1). According to scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and HR-TEM (Figures 1 and S1), these anatase nanocrystals
assemble into nanostructures with a uniform colloidal size of about
50 nm. Sample A11-50 (Figures 1 and S2, Table 1) basically differs from A6-50 in the anatase
crystal size (ca. 11 vs 6 nm for A6-50). Sample A6-80 (Figures 1 and S3, Table 1) differs
from A6-50 in the nanostructure size (80 vs 50 nm). Here, we must
mention that the protocol followed to prepare sample A6-50 was similar
to the one described in ref (57), although A6-50 was scaled up to produce ca. 2.5 g of nanostructures
versus 1 g per batch. This scaling led to a slight increase in size,
which is almost within the experimental error (50 vs 40 nm), and a
more significant loss of mesocrystalline character (loss of alignment
but importantly same (101) exposed surface). A careful look at the
data also shows a slight decrease in the average nanostructure size
from A6-50 (52 nm from size analysis) to A11-50 (48 nm from size analysis).
This size reduction could reflect some densification during the different
thermal treatment (250 °C/air/24 h vs 500 °C/N2/2 h), which is consistent with the reduction in the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and the increase in the anatase crystal size. However,
this difference is within both the experimental and precision errors
and therefore cannot be considered as conclusive. Table 1 summarizes the main structural
and textural characteristics of the samples that were named as mentioned
in the Experimental Section after the anatase
crystal and nanostructure sizes for a better follow-up. Thus, A6-50
and A11-50 have a similar nanostructure size and a majority of (101)
exposed surfaces, while differing in the anatase crystal size and
BET surface area. Comparison of these two nanostructures could help
us discern differences associated with changes in the anatase crystal
size. On the other hand, A6-50 and A6-80 show a majority of (101)
exposed surfaces, have a similar crystal size and BET surface area
(importantly to N2), while differing in the nanostructure
size. A comparison of the electrochemical behaviors of these two samples
could, in principle, help us better understand a less explored factor
(electrochemical activity as a function of nanostructure size or in
general aggregate size effects). Indeed, A6-50 and A6-80 have similar
N2-based BET surface areas, but this parameter does not
assure similar penetrability of the electrolyte. Basically, in A6-80,
the electrolyte has to diffuse a longer distance to be impregnated.
Interestingly, this effect is maximized with ionic liquid electrolytes
that show low penetrability.50,57−59 The schematic representation displayed in Figure 2 ideally captures the main differences between
samples and their possible impact on the electrochemical activity.

enable visualization of anatase planes and the full colloidal nanostructure
in a single image (see Figures S1–S3 for a better visualization of all HR-TEM features). Basically, as
better explained in the main text, all of the samples consist of uniform
colloidal nanostructures formed by more or less aligned anatase nanocrystals,
exposing a majority of (101) surfaces, differing in a controlled way
in the anatase nanocrystal size and nanostructure size.

and A6-80 (right) nanostructures, which ideally captures the main
differences between the samples and their possible impact on the electrochemical
activity. We must keep in mind that all nanostructures showed a majority
of (101) exposed surfaces, which excludes this factor from being the
cause of possible differences in the electrochemical activity.

a In addition to
the BET surface area
determined from N2 isotherms, we also present the surface
area values estimated from the nanostructure size and their corresponding
anatase building blocks. The fact that BET areas are more similar
to the ones derived from the anatase building blocks reflects the
high accessibility of nanostructures to N2. Importantly,
this high accessibility does not necessarily reflect the accessibility
of the ionic liquid during electrochemical operation (wetting of all
nanostructure volume).

Conductivity
of the Pyr14-TFSI/NaTFSI (0.2 M) Electrolyte
A
limiting factor in battery performance with ionic liquid electrolytes
is slow ion transport throughout the electrolyte.57 The conductivity of the Pyr14TFSI/NaTFSI (0.2
M) electrolyte is similar to that of the LiTFSI counterpart at our
working temperatures (30 and 60 °C) (Figure S4). More specifically, the conductivity values for Na and
Li electrolytes at 30 °C are 2.99 and 2.89 mS cm–1, respectively. At 60 °C, the conductivity values are 7.69 and
8.45 mS cm–1. Unlike in water and organic carbonates,
the conductivity has important contributions from the solvent and
therefore does not directly reveal the battery active ion conductivity.
However, the similarity between Na and Li electrolytes suggests similar
conductivities. Specifically, in our case, differences in ionic conductivities
between both electrolytes, if any, may be attributable to only viscosity,
which is strongly related to van der Waals interactions.60 In our case, the van der Waals interactions
of both systems are similar, so even the ionic radii of Li+ and Na+ being slightly different, we can expect similar
values of conductivity. Basically, any significant difference between
the electrochemical activities of Na-ion anatase anodes when compared
to those of their Li-ion counterpart must be associated with other
processes.

Impact of Nanostructure Features on the Formation
of SEIs with
Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI
As mentioned earlier, amorphization,
disorder, and/or conversion clearly mark a departure point from the
mechanism of Li-ion insertion in anatase. Also, as mentioned earlier,
the activity of anatase electrodes takes place at potentials below
1 V versus Na/Na+, where SEIs can be formed, and SEIs in
SIBs show different stability that that in their Li-ion counterparts.44,47 In addition, ionic liquid electrolytes show SEIs of different nature
to those of organic carbonate electrolytes,43 and here, we are dealing with an unexplored liquid electrolyte (Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI). Carbon effects of relative importance in other
studies can be discarded here, as we intentionally have limited its
amount to only the 10 wt % coming from the conductive additive. Furthermore,
our anodes are built upon well-defined undoped nanostructures with
a relatively high surface area and a relatively small crystal size.
High surface areas and small crystal sizes (surface species) are known
to enhance SEI formation.44 Thus, we carried
out ex situ postmortem SEM studies to monitor the impact of nanostructure
features on the formation of SEIs using Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI
as electrolyte. These studies were carried out on electrodes cycled
at 60 °C. At this temperature, electrolyte conductivity problems
associated with poor ion transport throughout the electrolyte are
minimized. Therefore, working at 60 °C assures a better electrochemical
activity and a faster formation of the SEI. We must remember that
we can proceed this way because ionic liquids are not flammable, have
low vapor pressure, and in general efficiently operate at temperatures
above 50 °C unlike organic carbonate electrolytes.57

Postmortem SEM images clearly capture
the different impacts of nanostructures on SEI extension (Figure 3). Thus, SEM images
confirm the high impact that A6-50 has on the formation of extended
SEIs. Specifically, SEM pictures clearly reveal SEI domains that extend
over 5 μm, severely blocking electrode porosity. These studies
also reveal that SEI extension is larger for A6-80 than for A11-50
nanostructures. Specifically, for electrodes based on A6-80 nanostructures,
the largest SEI domains extend over 500 nm, whereas for A11-50 nanostructures,
the SEI (if exists) seems limited to scales smaller than the nanostructure
itself (<50 nm). Importantly, preservation of the initial nanostructure
is clearly observed for A11-50. In any case, it seems clear that SEM
studies anticipate a better performance of the A11-50 electrodes followed
by A6-80 and A6-50.

Figure 3 (A), (B), and (C) Ex situ postmortem FE-SEM studies at
different
magnifications for electrodes built from A6-50, A6-80, and A11-50
nanostructures, respectively. SEM pictures clearly reveal more extended
SEI domains for A6-50 that severely block electrode porosity (some
SEI domains extend over 5 μm). For A6-80, SEI domains are significantly
less extended (the largest SEI domains extend over 0.5 μm).
Finally, electrodes built from A11-50 basically preserve their initial
electrode conformation (SEI domains if exist ≪ 50 nm).

SEM results indicate that the
effect of nanostructures on the formation
of SEIs strongly depends on size at different scale levels (nanocrystal
and nanostructure). Thus, a change in the anatase crystal size from
ca. 6 to 11 nm (A6-50 vs A11-50) strongly influences the extension
of SEI domains. This result obviously could also be explained in terms
of BET surface areas (Table 1), as usually is done when dealing with low- and high-surface-area
carbons. Perhaps, more unexpected is the fact that samples with similar
BET surface areas and anatase crystal sizes (A6-50 and A6-80) show
pronounced differences. Basically, size effects seen through the nanostructure
volume size strongly influence SEI formation. This result, basically,
reminds us that care should be taken when comparing the electrochemical
activity in terms of BET surface areas.

Electrochemical Performance
Figure 4 shows the
rate capability performance of
the electrodes at 30 °C. As mentioned in the Experimental Section, a working temperature of 30 °C
was chosen instead of RT for a better thermostatic control with our
controller. As described earlier, postmortem SEM studies indicated
more extended SEI domains for anodes built from the A6-50 nanostructures
(the largest SEI domains extended over 5 μm), which severely
blocked electrode porosity. Therefore, we could expect the worst performance
for this nanostructure, as indeed is observed in the rate capability
results at 30 °C plotted in Figure 4. Focusing on the A6-80 and A11-50 nanostructures,
the latter shows a much better rate capability performance (Figure 4). The postmortem
SEM analysis carried out earlier clearly showed a more extended SEI
for A6-80 (the largest SEI domains extended over 500 nm), which can
also explain its worst performance when compared to that of A11-50.
We must keep in mind that the inherent low penetrability of ionic
liquid electrolytes could maximize SEI effects, allowing a clear separation
of these processes from electrochemical processes strictly associated
with the anatase anode. Thus, among the three nanostructures studied,
A11-50 has the more effective combination of anatase crystal size
and nanostructure size to favor the electrochemical activity while
preventing the formation of extended SEIs.

current of 336 mA/g (based on the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox
couple). (A) Rate capability performance of the three studied electrodes

rate of 0.2 C. (C), (D), and (E) Discharge–charge curves of
the first five galvanostatic cycles at a current rate of 0.2 C for
A6-50, A6-80, and A11-50, respectively. The inset in (C) clearly shows
abrupt changes in the voltage decay during the first discharge of
electrodes built from A6-50. (F) Cyclability performance at full discharge
at a current rate of 0.5 C for the A11-50 nanostructures along with
the corresponding Coulombic efficiency (Ceff) values (defined as the
ratio of full capacity in charge/full capacity in discharge).

Figure 4 shows the
galvanostatic curves at 30 °C for the A6-50, A6-80, and A11-50
nanostructures at a current density of 0.2 C (67 mA/g). For electrodes
built from the A6-50 nanostructures, the profile for the first discharge
curve shows abrupt irregularities and, overall, the first five galvanostatic
cycles manifest a poor performance. These curves clearly indicate
that the extended SEIs observed during postmortem SEM studies block
electrochemical processes in this electrode. Thus, this electrode
was no further characterized, as the overall electrochemical response
has a significant contribution from the extended SEI presence. In
any case, although no further electrochemical analysis of this electrode
was carried out, this result clearly reveal how SEIs can significantly
slow down the electrochemical activity in Na-ion anatase electrodes.
The voltage profile of A11-50 for the first discharge curve (Figure 4) shows a sharp decrease
from the open circuit voltage down to a voltage of ca. 0.5 V (uptake
of 0.20 Na+), followed by a quasi-plateau region down to
the cutoff voltage of 0.1 V (uptake of 0.85 Na+). This
quasi-plateau, in a more detailed view, seems to consist of two separate
regions with different slopes (even less pronounced at voltages about
0.2 V). Full explanation of these two different regions is given below
during the characterization of this nanostructure at 60 °C, where
these regions can be clearly separated (see Figure 5 and detailed explanation below). The total
uptake at 30 °C for the A11-50 electrodes (1.05) is close to
1 Na+ per formula unit. For A6-80, the voltage profile
shows basically a continuous decrease, corresponding to a total uptake
of 0.60 Na+. Interestingly, in the upper voltage region
(2.5–0.5 V) where both nanostructures show a similar profile
(continuous curve), the Na+ uptake is more significant
for the A6-80 nanostructures (0.40 or 65% of total uptake) than that
for A11-50 (0.20 or 20% of total uptake). In fact, the average potential
for electrodes built from A6-80 is ca. 0.7 V, whereas for those built
from A11-50, it is ca. 0.3 V. The upper voltage region includes the
formation of SEIs with a possible contribution from pseudocapacitive
processes.17,18,37 However, the high irreversibility after the first cycle seems to
downgrade the possible contribution of pseudocapacitive processes
and point to the formation of SEIs. Thus, in A6-80, the overall mechanism
seems to be controlled by the formation of a SEI, which prevents substantial
uptake below 0.5 V (0.2 Na+ vs 0.8–0.9 Na+ for A11-50). This result confirms the conclusions drawn from postmortem
SEM studies and supports the argument that the poor capability performance
of A6-80, when compared to that of A11-50, is mainly associated with
the formation of a more extended SEI. As SEI for A6-80 is not as extended
as for A6-50, we remark again that the inherent low penetrability
of ionic liquid electrolytes has maximized SEI effects, allowing a
clear separation of these processes from electrochemical processes
strictly associated with the anatase anode. As mentioned above, for
A11-50, full explanation of the low-voltage region is given below
during the characterization of this nanostructure at 60 °C, where
different processes are clearly separated (see Figure 5 and detailed explanation below).

current of 336 mA/g (based on the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox
couple). (A) Discharge–charge curves of the first five galvanostatic

at full discharge at a current rate of 0.5 C along with the corresponding
Ceff values (defined as the ratio of full capacity in charge/full
capacity in discharge) for A11-50.

After the first discharge process, the galvanostatic curves
at
30 °C for A11-50 show a significant change in the voltage profile
(Figure 4). The voltage
profiles do not show plateau regions, which is indicative of irreversible
structural changes (including amorphization).17,18 Thus, it seems that irreversibility in this nanostructure has a
different origin to that detected for A6-80. Again, full explanation
is given below during the characterization of this nanostructure at
60 °C, where results are better defined. The Ceff (first discharge–charge
cycles) for A11-50 is 36%, whereas for the A6-80 electrode, it is
27%. These values are similar to those reported in the literature
for TiO2 electrodes immersed in organic carbonate electrolytes.7,25,41 Interestingly, in the voltage
curves of both electrodes, we do not observe the characteristic continuous
decrease in the specific capacity after the first cycle. As better
explained below after cyclability studies, this peculiar behavior
can be explained in terms of the confluence of two opposite effects.

Among the three nanostructures, A11-50 shows superior electrochemical
response at 30 °C. Thus, we proceeded to further investigate
its cyclability at 0.5 C (168 mAh/g). Figure 4 shows that the full specific capacity on
discharge first decreases during the first five cycles and then increases
until a value of about 100 mAh/g after 40 cycles. Finally, it reaches
a relatively stable value at around 97 mAh/g (200 cycle). Capacity
increases during the first cycles seem intrinsic to the uptake of
Na+ by anatases, as they have also been reported in organic
carbonate electrolytes.18,19,28 This increase has been associated with a generic electrochemical
activation process. In our system, the more peculiar behavior (decrease–increase–stability)
can be explained in terms of (a) the irreversibility that prevails
during the first cycles (decrease during first cycles); (b) the generic
electrochemical activation process and/or better wetting that dominate
the next cycles (increase); and (c) reaching the typical quasi-stationary
regime. The Ceff (Figure 4) follows a trend similar to that of specific capacity. It
increases with the number of discharge/charge cycles, reaching a value
of 99% after 200 cycles.

Safety being a primary concern in stationary
applications, it seems
reasonable to present the electrochemical activity at 60 °C for
the electrodes showing the superior electrochemical performance at
30 °C (A11-50). Furthermore, as we explain below, this characterization
has helped us to better understand the mechanism of Na+ uptake by anatase electrodes. Importantly, we must remember that
the impact of nanostructures on SEI formation was checked at this
temperature and showed excellent preservation of the initial morphology
and no porosity blocking for A11-50 (Figure 3). We must also keep in mind that high viscosity
and slow ion transport effects are minimized for ionic liquids at
60 °C when compared to those at 30 °C,57 which anticipates a better electrochemical performance
at 60 °C than at 30 °C. Figure 5 shows the galvanostatic curves at 60 °C
for the electrode built from the A11-50 nanostructures at a current
density of 0.2 C (67 mA/g). The shape of the first discharge curve
slightly differs from the one at 30 °C. After a sharp drop from
the open circuit voltage down to a voltage of ca. 0.7 V, we clearly
see a quasi-plateau region down to 0.3 V corresponding to an uptake
of ca. 0.8 Na+, followed at 0.3 V by a distinctive plateau
corresponding to an uptake of ca. 0.5 Na+. Finally, we
see a final decay down to the cutoff voltage of 0.1 V. Interestingly,
during the charge cycle (desodiation process), the electrode recovers
a capacity of 260 mAh/g, corresponding to a release of ca. 0.8 Na+ (similar to the Na+ uptake of the quasi-plateau
region). Furthermore, during the subsequent cycles, the lower-voltage
plateau region is no longer observed but the quasi-plateau region,
though less defined, corresponds to a Na+ uptake of ca.
0.6 Na+. The total uptake for the electrode built upon
the A11-50 nanostructure during the first discharge (1.60 Na+ or strictly 535 mAh/g as not all of this capacity has to be related
to Na+ uptake) is certainly higher than that corresponding
to the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple. As mentioned
earlier, values higher than those corresponding to ca. 1 Na+ uptake per anatase formula are not rare and have been observed fundamentally
in doped nanosized anatases (see Table S1).6,16,20−23,25,28,29,31,32,35,39,40,42 Also, as mentioned earlier, for the A11-50 nanostructure, SEI seems
to be limited to scales smaller than the nanostructure itself (<50
nm). Furthermore, the electrode built upon A11-50 is basically an
undoped anatase (only 10 wt % of carbon additive). Therefore, an uptake
of 1.60 Na+ (strictly 535 mAh/g as not all of this capacity
has to be related to Na+ uptake) could be understood in
terms of first the insertion of ca. 1 Na+ following the
insertion mechanism proposed by Dambournet and co-workers.17 The extra uptake of Na+ by the electrode (0.6
Na+ or strictly 200 mAh/g as not all of this capacity has
to be related with Na+ uptake) could be associated with
those processes of more irreversible nature than that associated with
insertion. For instance, the conversion mechanism proposed by Passerini
and co-workers.16,18 These findings are confirmed
by analyzing the first four cyclic voltammograms at a scan rate of
0.05 mV/s for electrodes built from the A11-50 nanostructures (Figure 5). The cathodic sweep
during the first cycle shows a reversible reduction peak at 0.6 V,
followed by a strongly irreversible reduction peak at 0.2 V for the
A11-50 nanostructures. For electrodes built from nanostructures with
extended SEIs (A6-80), irreversibility clearly comes from SEI formation
at high voltages. Thus, the cathodic sweep in Figure 5 displays an irreversible reduction peak
at high potentials 1.9 V (not seen in A11-50) during the first cycle
followed by a poorly defined reversible reduction peak at ca. 0.7
V (better resolved on the anodic sweeps). This reversible peak at
ca. 0.7 V is similar though much lower in intensity than the reversible
peak at 0.6 V observed for A11-50. Regarding the irreversible peak
at 1.9 V, we must comment that the electrochemical activity above
1.5 V has been observed in Na-ion TiO2 electrodes immersed
in organic carbonate electrolytes.11,31 A common characteristic
is that these electrodes are built from high-surface-area samples.
More specifically, a low-intensity peak at around 1.7 V was observed
in the cyclic voltammograms of high-surface-area TiO2 rutile
mesocrystals immersed in ethylene/dimethyl carbonates and was generically
assigned to SEI formation.11 The high-voltage
irreversible peak at 1.9 V for electrodes based on A6-80, which is
not detected for A11-50 electrodes, seems to corroborate its link
to SEI reactions (confirmed by the postmortem SEM studies shown in Figure 3). Another important
conclusion drawn from the comparison of voltammograms for A11-50 and
A6-80 comes from the analysis of the lower-voltage region. The strongly
irreversible peak at 0.2 V detected in the voltammogram of A11-50
is not detected for A6-80 (Figure 5). As mentioned earlier, it seems clear that the formation
of a SEI at high potentials for A6-80 prevents this process to take
place.

The rate capability performance for A11-50 is also displayed
in Figure 5. As expected,
the
performance is significantly better than that obtained at 30 °C.
For example, at 5 C (1680 mAh/g), the specific capacity reaches values
of 60 mAh/g vs. 20 mAh/g at 30 °C. As mentioned earlier, the
high viscosity and slow ion transport effects are minimized for ionic
liquids at 60 °C when compared to those at 30 °C.57 Finally, the cyclability performance at 0.5
C (168 mAh/g) is also shown in Figure 5. Interestingly, the trend after the fourth cycle in
specific capacity values is close to the characteristic behavior observed
in Li-ion anatase anodes (a decrease followed by a more or less quasi-stationary
value). This behavior indicates that this sample at this temperature
is electrochemically active almost from the beginning of the electrochemical
process. Furthermore, the initial Ceff at this current is similar
to the one at 30 °C (ca. 30%) and increases with the number of
discharge/charge cycles, reaching a value close to 100% after 200
cycles. To summarize the results of the high-temperature study, if
safety is a primary concern for stationary applications, the electrochemical
response of the electrodes built upon the A11-50 nanostructures is
excellent at 60 °C.

Finally, the electrochemical activity
of the optimized anatase
nanostructure (A11-50) on Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI (0.2 M) was
compared to that of similar nanostructures also in Pyr14TFSI-LiTFSI (0.2 M).57 As mentioned earlier,
SIBs are intended for replacement of LIBs in stationary applications.
The results of that comparison in terms of the rate capability performance
at both 30 and 60 °C are given in Figure 6. Basically, the performances of Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI and Pyr14TFSI-LiTFSI are similar at
both temperatures, obviously, excluding the higher initial irreversibility
value that is ubiquitous to Na-ion when compared to that of Li-ion
anatase anodes. This, a priori, surprising result can be likely explained
by the fact that the electrochemical response of anatase nanostructures
in Pyr14TFSI is controlled (especially at high rates) by
the poor ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Finally, it seems
important to mention that long-term cyclability studies were not compared
because of the different stabilities of the Na and Li metal electrodes,47 which does not assure a clean experiment.

in Pyr14TFSI-LiTFSI (also 0.2 M).57

Conclusions
In
summary, we have found that uniform anatase nanostructures immersed
in ionic liquid electrolytes (Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI) are excellent
combinations to advance the understanding of Na-ion battery anatase
anodes. Specifically, we have found that a controlled variation in
the nanocrystal size and nanostructure size can lead to electrodes
that have very different impacts on the electrolyte stability and
that the inherent low penetrability of the ionic liquid electrolyte
has resulted in an unexpected asset to clarify differences in Na+ uptake (SEI effects maximized). Thus, comparison of electrodes
with different impacts on SEI formation has indicated that during
the first discharge the process associated with a more or less defined
plateau at ca. 0.3 V stops from being operative when SEIs block electrode
porosity. For the well-preserved electrodes, Na+ uptakes
well-beyond those of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple
during the first cycle have been explained in terms of a combination
of two mechanisms with different degrees of reversibility. Our results
emphasize that any conclusions on mechanistic studies, other than
size effects, must be done under strict control on size at various
scales and taking into consideration SEI presence. Furthermore, the
fact that electrodes built from nanostructures with similar crystal
sizes and BET surface areas but different nanostructure sizes (size
effects seen through the nanostructure volume size) differ in their
impact toward SEI formation reminds us that care should be taken when
comparing the electrochemical activity in terms of BET surface areas.
Finally, we have found that at 30 and 60 °C the performance of
the best of the electrodes with the ionic liquid electrolyte is comparable
to that of similar nanostructures immersed in their Li-ion counterparts.
This result is somehow promising, as in stationary applications where
SIBs could replace LIBs, large accumulation of storage units turn
safety into an even more demanding priority. Basically, power criteria
can be relaxed in response to more strict safety criteria.

Experimental
Section
Anatase Synthesis
We have previously reported that
a method that combines thermally driven self-assembly of nanomicelles
with seeding-assisted chemistry allows the preparation of mesoporous
anatase nanostructures with a uniform colloidal size and good textural
properties.57,61,62 These nanostructures can be described as colloidal structures of
more or less oriented anatase nanocrystals (more or less mesocrystalline
character) exposing a majority of (101) surfaces. Here, we have used
this methodology for the preparation of a variety of anatase nanostructures
that differ in the size of the anatase nanocrystal units and nanostructure
size. Specifically, we have prepared three different samples for this
study named as A6-50, A11-50, and A6-80. As we have shown in the Results and Discussion section (samples characterization),
these names allow a rapid identification of the samples based on the
anatase crystal size and the nanostructure size. For the preparation
of nanostructure A6-50, we have followed the same protocol as that
reported earlier by some of us.57 However,
here, we have scaled up the process 2.5 times (ca. 2.5 vs 1 g of nanostructures
per batch for that study). For the preparation of nanostructure A11-50,
we have followed a similar protocol to that carried out for A6-50,
although heating in air at 250 °C/24 h was replaced by heating
in a N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 2 h. Finally, nanostructure
A6-80 was obtained by reducing a 30 wt % the amount of seeds added
during the initial synthesis. Briefly, the procedure to obtain the
nanostructures consisted in preparing a microemulsion containing the
anatase precursors by dissolving TiOSO4 (1.25 M in H2SO4) solutions in an organic component (cyclohexane)
with the help of a nonionic surfactant (Igepal CO-520), followed by
the addition of anatase nanoseeds and a two-stage solvothermal treatment
at 60 and 80 °C, washing, drying, and a final thermal treatment. Table S2 summarizes the specifics of the different
reagents and specific protocols used for the preparation of these
samples.

Electrolyte Preparation and Conductivity Measurements
The ionic liquid electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.2 M sodium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI) in N-methyl-(n-butyl)pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide
(Pyr14TFSI from MERCK). Dielectric spectroscopy (using
a Novocontrol Alpha analyzer temperature controller over the frequency
range 0.1 Hz–10 MHz with an ac perturbation of 10 mV and stabilization
time of 10 min) was used to measure the ionic conductivity of the
Pyr14TFSI-NaTFSI (0.2 M) electrolyte as a function of temperature
as well as their Li counterparts. The ionic conductivity was extracted
from plotting the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance
using ZPlot fitting software. Importantly, in the specific case of
pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquids, the conductivity decreases with
the increase in the active ion concentration. To select the adequate
concentration of NaTFSI, a compromise between Na+ concentration
and conductivity must be achieved (0.2 M is an adequate value).

Structural and Textural Characterization
XRD patterns
were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance instrument (Cu Kα radiation,
40 kV, 30 mA). The crystal domain size was determined from the X-ray
peak profiles using the Scherrer equation applied to the (200) diffraction
peak. The morphology was investigated by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE–SEM, Hitachi, SU 8000). High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were taken in a JEOL 300 kV field
emission microscope. To determine the nanostructure size distribution,
several micrographs were taken for each sample in different regions
of the holder and around 100 particles were manually measured using
Adobe Photoshop. BET surface areas were obtained from the analysis
of the N2 isotherm at low pressures (0.05–0.20).

Electrochemical Characterization
For the electrochemical
characterization, film electrodes were prepared having a final composition
of 80 wt % TiO2 anatase nanostructures, 10 wt % conductive
carbon (TIMREX Super-P), and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder
(Mw ∼534 000, Aldrich).
For film preparation, all of the components were first dispersed in
1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (Aldrich). The obtained slurry was then stirred
for 24 h and casted on a copper foil (current collector) using a doctor
blade. Film electrodes were dried at 70 °C for 1.5 h and then
at 120 °C under vacuum, overnight. Finally, the dried electrodes
were transferred to an argon glove box (H2O content <1
ppm) for cell assembly. The active material mass loading was approximately
1.0 mg.

Coin-type cell configurations (size 2032) were assembled
in an argon glove box. A sheet of Whatman BSF-80 glass fiber was used
as a separator, which was drenched with an electrolyte. Sodium metal
(sticks pure, PanReac AppliChem) was used as the counter and reference
electrodes. Coin cells were maintained at 60 °C for 12 h prior
to any electrochemical measurement to assure better wetting. Galvanostatic
curves were registered with an Arbin-BT4 battery system, while a VMP3
Potentiostat (BILOGIC) was used to record cyclic voltammetry curves.
All electrochemical studies were performed within a cell voltage window
between 2.5 and 0.1 V versus Na/Na+. It should be noted
that all electrochemical measurements were duplicated to minimize
doubts about the reliability of the measurement. Electrochemical studies
were carried out at two different temperatures (30 and 60 °C)
under thermostatic conditions at different temperatures. Importantly,
a working temperature of 30 °C was chosen instead of RT for a
better thermostatic control.
