The kraft lignin’s low molecular
weight and too high hydroxyl
content hinder its application in bio-based carbon fibers. In this
study, we were able to polymerize kraft lignin and reduce the amount
of hydroxyl groups by incubating it with the white-rot fungus Obba rivulosa. Enzymatic radical oxidation reactions
were hypothesized to induce condensation of lignin, which increased
the amount of aromatic rings connected by carbon–carbon bonds.
This modification is assumed to be beneficial when aiming for graphite
materials such as carbon fibers. Furthermore, the ratio of remaining
aliphatic hydroxyls to phenolic hydroxyls was increased, making the
structure more favorable for carbon fiber production. When the modified
lignin was mixed together with cellulose, the mixture could be spun
into intact precursor fibers by using dry-jet wet spinning. The modified
lignin leaked less to the spin bath compared with the unmodified lignin
starting material, making the recycling of spin-bath solvents easier.
The stronger incorporation of modified lignin in the precursor fibers
was confirmed by composition analysis, thermogravimetry, and mechanical
testing. This work shows how white-rot fungal treatment can be used
to modify the structure of lignin to be more favorable for the production
of bio-based fiber materials.

Introduction
Environmental concerns
such as reduction of carbon footprint set
a demand for the development of more sustainable technologies and
materials. One way to respond to environmental challenges is to use
biorefinery side streams to develop cost-efficient and environmentally
friendly processes for renewable production of chemicals, materials,
fuels, and energy.1 Lignin is the second-most
abundant biopolymer after cellulose, and due to its aromatic nature,
it could be used to replace oil-based starting materials and chemicals.
Different types of technical lignins have been produced mostly as
side products of the pulp and paper industry. So far, they have been
utilized only to a small extent in commercial applications such as
production of vanillin2 and industrial
binders.3 Nevertheless, the vast majority
of the approximately 100 million tons of technical lignins produced
annually is not refined into carbon-sequestering products but mostly
burned as a low-value fuel.

The interest of applying lignin
in more sophisticated and higher
value applications is growing.4 Lignins
have shown great potential as a raw material, for example, in energy
storage applications,5−7 carbon fibers,8−10 and nanoparticles for drug delivery.11 Especially, the lignin-based carbon fibers have
gained a lot of attention because lignins have a high carbon content
(approximately 60%), and they are rich in aromatic moieties, which
are both desired features when aiming for carbon fibers with good
mechanical properties.1,12 Lignin-based carbon fibers could
represent more than 50% cheaper option than the current polyacrylonitrile
(PAN)-based fibers13 and could be utilized
in various applications with moderate strength requirements such as
in light-weight composites for the automotive sector.14 The weight reduction of cars is urgently needed to comply
with the EU emission target of 95 g CO2/km effective in
2021.15 Moreover, lignin-based carbon fibers
have high electrochemical activity and serve as an excellent electrode
material in the batteries and supercapacitors needed for the increasing
electrification of transportation.16,17

Kraft
lignins are side products of the kraft pulping process that
is the principal method for the production of wood pulp today. These
lignins comprise 90% of the annually produced technical lignins, and
they have been studied as a starting material for carbon fiber production.18,19 However, the mechanical properties of fully lignin-based fibers
do not meet the standards, which are required from the materials intended
for the automotive industry. Lignin has also been combined with PAN
to gain partially bio-based carbon fibers.20,21 Unfortunately, the mechanical properties of these fibers are not
satisfying, and the cost of the final products is still highly dependent
on the price of PAN. Several studies have shown that fractionation
of technical lignins provides a way to gain starting materials with
enhanced properties such as better spinnability, which result in higher-quality
carbon fibers.12,22 Commercially available kraft
lignin that has been fractionated using LignoBoost technology is less
polydisperse and contains less impurities than traditional kraft lignin
and therefore has potential in carbon fiber production.23,24 However, the previous attempts to produce carbon fibers from LignoBoost-type
lignins have shown only preliminary prospects.25,26 Successful stabilization of purely lignin-based precursor fibers
remains very challenging, which, in most cases, has lowered the quality
of the final product. Recently, Byrne et al. have presented a new
bicomponent dry-jet wet spinning method to resolve the issues encountered
when trying to produce purely lignin-based fibers.27 They show that, by combining lignin with cellulose, stronger
and faster stabilizing fibers are formed compared to fibers based
on either of the components only.

To further enhance the properties
of cellulose-lignin precursor
fibers, the chemical properties of lignin could be tuned in a sustainable
way by utilizing fungal enzymes. For example, laccases oxidize phenolic
hydroxyl groups and have been reported to slightly depolymerize lignin,
but the formed radicals preferably repolymerize rapidly, thus resulting
in polymerization of lignin.28,29 Both increase of molecular
weight and decrease of hydroxyl content have been suggested to be
beneficial changes in the lignin structure when aiming for high-quality
carbon fibers.23 Radical polymerization
causes also condensation of lignin. This increases the abundance of
aromatic rings connected by carbon–carbon bonds that are the
basis of the graphite structure in carbon fibers.

In nature,
basidiomycete wood-decaying white-rot fungi are unique
in their ability to degrade all the components of plant biomass. They
secrete a set of enzymes to degrade and modify lignin and to get access
to hemicelluloses and cellulose, which they use as carbon and energy
sources.30 The basidiomycete fungus Obba rivulosa(31) is a rare
wood-decaying white-rot species, which grows on softwood in northern
temperate and boreal forests. In its natural environment, O. rivulosa degrades lignin by producing extracellular
nonselective oxidative enzymes such as class II heme peroxidases and
laccases, and therefore, it was chosen to modify softwood-derived
kraft lignin.

In this study, we show that O.
rivulosa was able to secrete an enzyme mixture with
a high potential for
lignin modification. We cultivated O. rivulosa on Lineo kraft lignin that has been produced using LignoBoost technology. O. rivulosa polymerized the lignin and concomitantly
increased the level of condensation and decreased the abundance of
hydroxyl groups, which are modifications that can enhance the quality
of the resulting fibers.23,24 Our findings demonstrate
that fungal treatment can be utilized for sustainable valorization
of kraft lignin.

Results and Discussion
Secretome Analysis
The secretome—that is, the
extracellular enzymes—of O. rivulosa from the 1 week lignin cultivation showed 15 detected proteins (Table 1). The majority were
carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) belonging either to the glycoside
hydrolase (GH), carbohydrate esterase (CE), or auxiliary activity
(AA) families (www.cazy.org).
Laccase 1 (Lcc1, family AA1) and Mn-peroxidase (MnP, family AA2) were
the identified lignin-modifying oxidoreductases. Previously, laccase-
and oxidoreductase-containing secretomes have been shown to cause
both depolymerization and repolymerization of lignin substrates.32 Laccase activity in the secretome of O. rivulosa was 1.3 μkat L–1 when 2,6-DMP was used as a substrate. The MnP detected in the secretome
may also have a role in lignin modification. However, the measured
MnP activity in the culture medium was under reliable detection limit,
and therefore, we suggest that only laccase contributed to lignin
modification. Furthermore, the MnP-promoted reactions resemble laccase-catalyzed
reactions in lignin, modifying basically only phenolic structures
in our reaction conditions.33 Lcc1 was
the only laccase detected from O. rivulosa grown on spruce wood (Marinović et al., unpublished), and
it has been also purified from spruce wood chip cultivations,34 suggesting an important role for this isoenzyme
in lignin modification. In addition, enzymes from families GH6, GH15,
GH16, GH35, GH79, and CE16 were detected in the secretome.

Lignin Analysis
Untreated kraft lignin, reference lignin
incubated without fungus, and lignin incubated with O. rivulosa were referred as KL, RL, and OL, respectively.
The molecular weight distributions of all samples were analyzed by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Figure 1). The Mn/Mw values of KL, RL, and OL were measured to
be 900/2020, 990/2200, and 1260/3140 Da, respectively. When compared
to untreated lignin (KL), the molecular weight distributions of fungal-treated
lignin (OL) increased by 40–55%. The small 9–10% increase
in molecular weights of reference samples (RL) was most likely due
to the chemical and structural heterogeneity of kraft lignin.35 A small part of lignin dissolved in to the solution
and was not collected in filtration after the incubations. This residual
lignin was observed as a light brown color in the filtrates, and it
was removed before analyzing the secretome (see the Supporting Information). Incubation did not remarkably affect
the polydispersity of lignin; thus, the calculated PDIs of all samples
were between 2.22 and 2.49. Taken together, GPC results show that
the enzymes secreted by O. rivulosa cause polymerization of lignin. In contrast, the white-rot fungal
species Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been shown to catalyze both degradation and condensation of
synthetic lignin depending on the incubation time of the cultivations.36

lignin.
KL, RL, and OL stand for untreated lignin, reference lignin incubated
without fungus, and lignin incubated with O. rivulosa, respectively. Vertical error bars represent standard deviations
of three replicate experiments.

The relative abundance of lignin interunit bonds and structural
units between different samples was studied by 1H–13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (HSQC NMR) (Figure 2). Interpretations were done according to
the literature (see Experimental Section), and distinct
peaks were integrated (Table S2, Supporting
Information). The spectra measured from KL (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and RL (Figure 2a–c) were very similar, and no remarkable
modifications could be observed in the lignin structure. The only
noticeable differences in RL were the appearance of residual nondeuterated
DMSO, succinic acid (δC/δH 28.8/2.4), and carbohydrates
(δC/δH 68–77/2.9–3.6) originating from the
culture medium. In the spectra of OL (Figure 2d–f), no sign of carbohydrates from
the culture medium was detected, and the signals of xylose and xylan
originating from kraft lignin were decreased as well. This indicates
that the fungus consumed the available carbohydrates. The signals
of extractives at the aliphatic region (Figure 2c,f) and at the aromatic region (Figure 2a,d) were smaller
in the spectra of OL than in the spectra of RL. Incubation together
with O. rivulosa seemed to induce condensation
of the lignin detected as a decrease of G2, G5 and G6 signals at the aromatic region. This finding is
in good agreement with the previously discussed GPC results and the
work of Zhao et al. where kraft lignin was treated with laccase.37

and (d–f)
lignin incubated with O. rivulosa OL.
Color-coded abbreviations correlate to (g) the different lignin interunit
bonds and structural units, and the interpretations were done according
to the literature (see Experimental Section).

In addition, fungal treatment
of lignin removed or decreased the
aromatic area signals coming from aryl enol ether (EE), stilbene (St),
and β-5 stilbene (β5St) interunit bonds and coniferyl
aldehyde (CA) and coniferyl alcohol (CoA) end groups. This suggests
that enzymatic mixture secreted by O. rivulosa modified the double bonds between α- and β-carbons.
Moreover, all the signals coming from diaryl ether (4O52,6) units found in both KL and RL were not present after fungal treatment.
At the aliphatic area (Figure 2c,f), the guaiacyl hydroxyethyl ketone (HKγ) and guaiacyl acetic acid (AAα) lignin unit signals
diminished clearly, and also, several unidentified peaks either disappeared
or decreased.

The changes in the chemical structure of lignin
were further studied
by using 13C NMR (Figure 3). Carbohydrates from the culture medium were visible
at the aliphatic side-chain region (δC 68–77 and 92–98)
in the spectrum of RL. The broadening of the peaks at the aromatic
region (δC 108–155) in the spectrum of OL is a clear
indication of polymerization and condensation by fungal treatment.
The uronic acid carbonyl group signal at 179.7 ppm and Cα carbonyl
group signal at 191.3 ppm were visible in the spectra of KL and RL
but not in the spectrum of OL. These findings support the assumption
that enzyme activities produced by the fungus remove carbohydrates
and polymerize lignin.

reference
lignin (RL), and untreated lignin (KL).

The changes in the hydroxyl contents were analyzed using the quantitative 31P NMR technique (Table 2). The total hydroxyl contents for KL, RL, and OL were
6.40, 5.96, and 4.51, respectively. The decrease in total hydroxyl
content is a sign of oxidation and condensation, as is also the broadening
of signals in the spectrum of fungal-treated samples (data not shown
here). Moreover, the ratio of aliphatic hydroxyls and phenolic hydroxyls
increased in the case of OL, resulting in theoretically more promising
material for carbon fiber production, due to enhanced intermolecular
interactions.21 More specifically, the
more equal amount of aliphatic and phenolic hydroxyls has been proposed
to result in multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonding between lignin
molecules, which can align the lignin molecules and enhance their
interaction with the quest polymers. At the carbonization step, these
better organized structures could result in more intact layers of
graphene.

Fiber and Material Analysis
Highly condensed lignin
would represent an excellent precursor material to obtain a carbon
matrix with extended graphene layers and high orientation upon pyrolysis.
This would lead to enhanced mechanical properties of the resulting
carbon fibers.12 However, classical melt
processing of high-molecular-weight lignin is not possible as the
glass transition temperature of such lignin samples is higher than
the decomposition temperature. Plasticizing chemical modifications
is required to obtain a thermoplastic biopolymer. To bypass this problem,
lignin can be dissolved in direct solvents along with cellulose as
the rheological lead polymer. The viscoelastic properties of the resulting
solution are mostly determined by the carbohydrate fraction, allowing
it to blend in any lignin species.38 In
this study, unmodified and fungal-treated lignins were mixed with
a commercial hardwood cellulose pulp, dissolved in the ionic liquid
1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene acetate ([DBNH]OAc), and spun into
mixed-polymer precursor fibers using a dry-jet wet spinning unit.38 To prepare 100 g of OL for fiber spinning, we
carried out over 400 repetitions in the same way as the three original
OL repetitions. We compared the OL-based fibers to fibers prepared
using untreated KL because no remarkable changes had been noticed
in the structure of RL that had been incubated without fungus.

The ratios of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose content in the
spun precursor fibers were determined by carbohydrate analysis (Table 3). Both fibers spun
using the KL and OL had a theoretical lignin content of 29.3%. However,
the measured lignin percentages for KL- and OL-based fibers were 25.5
and 27.2%, respectively. Also, the portions of cellulose and hemicelluloses
were measured to be closer to the theoretical value in the case of
OL than in the case of KL. Only a small portion of OL was lost in
the spin bath, which was also visible through discoloration of water
in the coagulation bath. More precisely, when the precursor fibers
were spun using untreated lignin, the color of the spin bath turned
more brownish than when using OL. This is an important aspect when
considering the recyclability of the solvents, which is an essential
factor for the economic viability of the processes.

The thermal properties of lignins and precursor fibers
were analyzed
using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) (Figure 4a–c)
and are reported in Table 4. In the case of the precursor fibers, the measurements were
performed on draw ratio 3 (DR3) and DR6 fibers; thus, any effect of
thickness appears at the range of these DRs. The TGA thermal degradation
data and the first derivative of TGA curve (DTG) for KL, RL, and OL
are presented in Figure 4a. KL had the highest stability with the decomposition temperature
(onset) at 323 °C. RL had 13 °C and OL 22 °C lower
onset temperature. The residual masses at 790 °C were between
42 and 46 wt %. KL had the lowest residual mass of 42.1 wt %, whereas
OL had the highest residual mass of 46.1 wt %. Increased residual
mass can be due to a more condensed and polymerized lignin structure.39 The peaks in the DTG curves (Figure 4a, inset) indicate the highest
decomposition rate, which were in line with the decomposition temperatures:
KL at 400 °C, RL at 392 °C, and OL at 380 °C.

The TGA curves for cellulose pulp and precursor fibers
are displayed
in Figure 4b. The decomposition
onset temperatures of OL-containing precursor fibers were 3–4
°C lower than that of cellulose pulp (onset temperature, 332
°C), which is explained by the 31 °C lower onset temperature
of pure OL lignin (Table 4). In the case of KL-containing fibers, the onset temperatures
were 0–2 °C lower than the onset of cellulose pulp. Interestingly,
the onset temperatures of both OL–cellulose and KL–cellulose
fibers are higher when compared to organosolv–cellulose pulp27 or PAN–alkali kraft fibers.23 This provides more flexibility for the stabilization
of the precursor fibers. The residual mass (at 790 °C) of cellulose
pulp was 11.2 wt %, whereas precursor fibers had residual masses between
23.3 and 24.9 wt %. As composites, the fibers’ residual masses
could also be calculated, and for example, for DR6 KL fibers, the
calculated residual mass is 0.255 × 42.1 wt % + 0.745 ×
11.2 wt % = 19.1 wt %, which is 4.2 wt % lower than the measured residual
mass. This suggests that the composite interactions affect the thermal
properties of the fibers. Overall, it seems that lignin is responsible
for most of the increase in the residual masses of the precursor fibers
and composite interactions make up for the remaining 3.4–5.3
wt % increase. The DTG curves for cellulose pulp and the cellulose–lignin
fibers are shown in the inset of Figure 4b. The maximum decomposition rates of cellulose
pulp, DR3 fibers, and DR6 fibers were at 358, 361, and 362 °C,
respectively. The decomposition of cellulose pulp slows down at temperatures
above 380 °C, while the fibers continue with further slow decomposition
between 400 and 470 °C (data not shown).

The glass transition
temperatures (Tg’s) of the lignin
samples were measured using DSC (Figure 4c). KL and RL had Tg values of 143 and 158 °C, respectively.
The 15 °C increase supports further the previously discussed
finding that a small part of the lignin stayed in the solution when
lignin was collected after the incubation, and most likely, the higher
molecular weight and structural rigidity of the collected lignin result
in higher Tg.40,41 The OL had a Tg of 177 °C, which
is 19 °C higher than that of RL and 34 °C higher than that
of KL. These results indicate that the enzyme mixture produced by O. rivulosa caused significant condensation of lignin
and the phenyl moieties. Cellulose pulp and the precursor fibers did
not show any glass transition between 20 and 260 °C in any heating
or cooling cycle. The lignin content in the fibers is only 25–28%,
and it seems to be so well incorporated that neither pure lignin nor
the composite polymer matrix gave rise to a detectable Tg. Above 260 °C, cellulose pulp and the fibers started
to decompose in a manner that is unfit for DSC measurements.

The morphology of the precursor fibers was analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 4d,e). All fibers had a circular cross section, smooth
fiber surface, and a fibrillar body. These are typical characteristics
for Lyocell-type fibers.42,43 The round cross section
with a very thin skin surrounding the filament is due to the postulated
spinodal decomposition during the coagulation process.44 The decrease in diameter with increasing DR
is clearly visible in Figure 4d,e. Nonetheless, the overall shape of the fibers does not
change much. The bundle-like arrangement of the cellulose microfibrils
reflects the orientation of the cellulose parallel to the fiber axis.
It is caused, to some extent, by the shear forces in the spin capillary,
but in particular, in dry-jet wet spun fibers, the orientation is
mostly induced by the filament draw. At higher DRs, it seems that
the fibers form partially two phases. It is possible that lignin as
a planar polymer of substantially lower hydrophilicity phase-separates
from the carbohydrate matrix during coagulation in water, forming
microdomains embedded in the fiber body. This is currently investigated
in more detail and will be reported in due time.

The mechanical
properties of the precursor fibers were measured
using a single-fiber tester. The tenacity and elongation of the precursor
fibers at different DRs are shown in Figure 4f,g. The increase in DR promotes the longitudinal
orientation of the cellulose polymer chains, which is reflected in
the increasing tenacity. Concomitantly, the crystallinity of the cellulosic
part in the fibers is getting higher, which makes the fiber stiffer
and decreases the elongation. However, in both cases of lignin–cellulose
fibers, the elongation was mostly independent from the DR. This is
attributed to the lignin moieties, acting as a softener within the
cellulose matrix. The tenacity is slightly lower and the elongation
is higher for the fibers with the fungal-treated lignin (OL). Less
lignin was lost during the spinning process when using the OL, making
the lignin content higher in the final precursor fibers compared to
the fibers made with KL lignin (Table 3). Ma et al. also reported that an increase in lignin
content leads to a softening effect, resulting in lower tenacity and
higher elongation.38,45

At DR 12, the tenacity
was 30.7 ± 2.2 cN/tex with the OL and
34.4 ± 2.6 cN/tex with KL. The tenacity values are in the same
order as for fibers with beech organosolv lignin. Ma and co-workers
reported a tenacity value of 30.1 ± 3.6 cN/tex (at DR 12.4) for
a fiber containing eucalyptus PHK pulp and organosolv beech lignin
(70:30).38

Despite the minor decrease
in tensile strength, both the carbohydrate
fraction and the lignin moieties are still highly orientated in the
longitudinal direction. This promotes the formation of a carbon matrix
with higher-order structure upon pyrolysis, as observed for both PAN-
and bio-based carbon fibers.46 In addition,
the circular cross section will allow for more uniform carbonization,
minimizing possible radial gradients and often observed skin-core
formation.12 In the future, we will study
further the carbonization and properties of carbon fibers based on
modified lignin and cellulose using a continuous carbonization line
in which tension during the heating phases can be controlled accurately.
This kind of fiber could replace the expensive and unsustainably produced
PAN-based carbon fibers or find use in battery electrodes and supercapacitors.

Conclusions
The enzymes produced by O. rivulosa catalyzed most likely oxidative radical coupling reactions, resulting
in a more polymerized and condensed structure of Lineo kraft lignin.
The ratio of aliphatic to phenolic hydroxyls of lignins increased,
while the total hydroxyl content decreased. These modifications make
the fungal-treated lignin a more promising material for carbon fiber
production.

Precursor fibers spun from the fungal-treated lignin
and cellulose
pulp retained the lignin almost entirely in fiber unlike the unmodified
lignin. The better lignin incorporation enables solvent recycling
and improves the overall economic feasibility of the process. Clear
polymer interactions in the precursor fibers affected the fibers’
mechanical properties and their thermal behavior during pyrolysis.
The carbon yield upon carbonization of the composite precursor fibers
was notably increased. All these desired properties indicate that
fungal treatment of kraft lignin results in a better starting material
for precursor fibers.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals were purchased from commercial
suppliers and utilized without any further purifications. Lineo softwood
kraft lignin was received from the Stora Enso Sunila Mill located
in Kotka, Finland, and it was tyndallized before use in the experiments.
Tyndallization did not modify the chemical structure of the KL, which
was verified by GPC, Py-GC–MS, HSQC NMR, (Figures S2 and S3) and TGA (Figure S4). Enocell Speciality Cellulose was received from Stora Enso Enocell
Mill in Finland. The cellulose was received as pulp sheets and ground
to a fine powder in a Wiley mill before use.

Fungal Strain and Cultivation
Conditions
The white
rot fungus O. rivulosa (FBCC939; syn. Physisporinus rivulosus) was obtained from the HAMBI
Fungal Biotechnology Culture Collection, University of Helsinki, Finland
(fbcc@helsinki.fi). The fungus was maintained on 2%
(w/v) malt extract agar plates and precultivated on low nitrogen (2
mM)–asparagine (0.52 mM)–succinate (10 mM)–(LN-AS)
(modified from Hatakka and Uusi-Rauva)47 minimal medium agar plates supplemented with 10% (w/v) tyndallized
lignin and 1% glucose at 28 °C in the dark for 1 week. Twenty
mycelia-covered agar plugs (Ø 0.5 cm) from the lignin plates
were transferred in 50 mL of LN-AS supplemented with 0.2 g of tyndallized
lignin and 2% DMSO to improve solubility of lignin to increase the
enzymatic reaction rate.48 The pH was adjusted
to 6.0. The cultivations were incubated at +28 °C with 60 rpm
agitation for 1 week. After cultivation, agar plugs and mycelia were
removed from cultivation media with a sieve. Lignin was collected
by using vacuum filtration and Whatman glass microfiber filters (GF/CTM;
diameter, 70 mm). Collected lignin was dried under air flow at room
temperature before analyzing it. All cultivations were performed in
triplicate. Reference lignin incubations in a culture medium without
fungus were also performed in triplicate. To confirm that the isolated
lignin did not contain remarkable amounts of fungal biomass, we analyzed
the amount of nitrogen in the untreated kraft lingin, reference lignin,
and fungal-treated lignin. The percentage of nitrogen was 0.05 ±
0.01% in all samples. The elemental analysis measurements were performed
on an Elementar Analysensysteme (HANAU) model vario MICRO cube, operated
in CHNS mode. Nitrogen was detected as a N2 gas with a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and He as a carrier gas.

Secretome
Analysis and Enzyme Activity Measurements
Twenty milliliters
of filtrate from each cultivation was processed
for proteomic studies. NaCl (2.22 mL; 5 M) was added to increase the
NaCl concentration to 0.5 M. The pH was adjusted to 3.5 by using 1
M HCl. Solutions were centrifuged with Thermo Scientific SL 16R centrifuge
(22 °C, 4000 rpm, 40 min). Supernatants were collected and tiny
residual lignin pellets stayed in the tubes. The pH of the collected
supernatants was increased to pH 5 by adding 1 M NaOH. The supernatants
were concentrated by using Amicon ultrafiltration units (Millipore)
with 10,000 NMWL polyethersulfone membrane (Sartorius, Germany) (8000
g, 15 min, 4 °C).

Cysteine bonds of the concentrated proteins
were reduced with 0.05 M TCEP [(tris(2-carboxyethol)phosphine hydrochloride
salt (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)] for 20 min at 37 °C and alkylated
with 0.15 M iodoacetamide (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at room temperature.
Samples were digested overnight at 37 °C by adding 1 μg
of trypsin (Promega). Digested peptides were quenched with 10% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) and purified with C18 microspin columns (Harvard Apparatus,
USA), eluting the samples to 0.1% TFA in 50% acetonitrile (ACN). The
dried peptides were reconstituted in 30 μL of 0.1% TFA in 1%
ACN (buffer A).

Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
analysis was carried out on an EASY-nLC1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Germany) connected to a Q Exactive hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Germany) with a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Germany). The LC–MS/MS samples were separated
using a two-column setup consisting of a 2 cm C18-Pepmap trap column
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany), followed by 15 cm C18-Pepmap
analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). The linear
separation gradient consisted of 5% buffer B in 5 min, 35% buffer
B in 20 min, 80% buffer B in 5 min, and 100% buffer B in 10 min at
a flow rate of 0.3 μL min–1 (buffer A: 0.1%
TFA in 1% acetonitrile; buffer B: 0.1% TFA acid in 98% acetonitrile).
Six microliters of the sample was injected per LC–MS/MS run
and analyzed. Full MS scan was acquired with a resolution of 70,000
at a normal mass range in the Orbitrap analyzer; the method was set
to fragment the 10 most intense precursor ions with HCD. Data was
acquired using LTQ Tune software.

Acquired MS2 scans were searched
against in-house protein database
including the predicted proteins obtained from the O. rivulosa genome49 using
the Sequest search algorithms in Thermo Proteome Discoverer. The allowed
mass error for the precursor ions was 15 ppm and for the fragment
in 0.05 Da. A static residue modification parameter was set for carbamidomethyl
(+57.021 Da (C)) of the cysteine residue. Methionine oxidation was
set as dynamic modification (+15.995 Da (M)). Only full-tryptic peptides
with a maximum of one missed cleavage were considered. The secretome
analyses were performed by the Proteomics Unit, Institute of Biotechnology,
University of Helsinki, Finland.

Laccase activity measurements
were performed using a Tecan Infinite
M200 plate reader (Tecan, Austria). Activity was determined spectrophotometrically
at 476 nm by detecting the oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (2,6-DMP;
Sigma Aldrich) at pH 6, which was in line with the cultivation conditions,
in malonate buffer.50 MnP activity was
determined by similar 2,6-DMP activity measurement where laccase activity
was subtracted and MnSO4 and H2O2 were used in malonate buffer.

GPC
The molecular
weight distributions of fungal-treated
and untreated lignin were measured by using Agilent 1260 Infinity
LC-UV system. Solid samples of 1–2.4 mg were mixed with DMF/LiBr
(1 g L–1) eluent to obtain 1 mg mL–1 final concentration. Samples were dissolved by mixing overnight
and filtered using 0.2 μm Acrodisc GHP Membrane HPLC filters
(Waters). Separation was performed using Acquity APC XT 200 2.5 and
45 1.7 μm columns (Waters) with 0.5 mL min–1 DMF/LiBr elution at 50 °C. A UV detector was run using 280
nm wavelength. Polystyrene standards (Scientific Polymer Products
and Fluka Analytical) were used for the calibration of the molar mass.
Data was processed using Agilent 1260 Infinity software to gain number-average
molecular weight (Mn), weight-average
molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity
index (PDI, Mw/Mn).

Py-GC–MS
Measurements were
performed using Pyrolab2000
pyrolyzer connected to Bruker Scion SQ 456 GC–MS. The pyrolysis
chamber temperature was kept at 150 °C, and samples were pyrolyzed
isothermally by heating the platinum filament in 8 ms to 580 °C
and keeping the temperature elevated for 2 s before rapid cooling
of the filament. Helium was used as a carrier gas at the flow rate
of 1 mL min–1. The injector temperature was 250
°C, and 1:2 split ratio was used. Pyrolysis products were separated
in an Agilent DB-5MS UI ((5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m ×
0.250 mm × 0.25 μm film) capillary column. The column oven
temperature was kept at 50 °C for 2 min, after which the temperature
was increased at 10 °C min–1 rate to 280 °C,
resulting in a 25 min overall run time. The ion source temperature
was 250 °C with electron ionization of 70 eV. The MS scan range
was 40–400 m/z. Twenty-five
peaks were detected from the total ion count chromatograms between
3.3 and 14.3 min retention times, and 22 of the compounds could be
identified by comparing to standard sample runs, to the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) library, and to the literature.48,51−55

HSQC NMR
Samples were dissolved in DMSO-d6 (65 mg in 0.7 mL) by stirring overnight. The 2D 1H–13C HSQC spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance NEO 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Bruker 5 mm direct
detection PA BBO BBF H-D-05-Z SP SmartProbe using the multiplicity-edited
HSQCEDETGPSISP pulse sequence at 23 °C. The spectral width in
F2 (1H) dimension was 13.15 ppm with 2048 data points,
and the spectral width in F1 (13C) dimension was 165 ppm
with 256 data points. For each spectrum, 64 scans were measured using
1.5 s relaxation delay, which resulted in 7 h, 51 min, and 37 s measurement
time. The spectra were processed with Bruker TopSpin 4.0.2 software.
The solvent signal (2.5/39.52 ppm) was used in the calibration, and
the HSQC cross-signals were assigned according to the literature.35,56−62

13C NMR
The spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance III 500 MHz equipped with a Bruker 5 mm BBO probe. Lignin samples
solvated in DMSO-d6 were measured using
the zgpg30 pulse program with a 90° pulse angle at 60 °C.
A total of 68,608 scans were run using 1.188 s acquisition time and
2 s relaxation delay, which resulted in 2 days, 13 h, 57 min, and
57 s experiment time for each sample. The spectra were processed with
Bruker TopSpin 4.0.2 software. The solvent signal (39.52 ppm) was
used in the calibration, and signals were assigned according to the
literature.35,63

Quantitative 31P NMR
Measurements were performed
as reported previously.64,65 Well-dried 40 mg lignin
samples were mixed with 0.6 mL of 1.6:1 Pyr/CDCl3 and stirred
overnight, followed by addition of 0.2 mL of internal standard (N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid imide; 9.27
mg mL–1 in CDCl3), 50 μL of chromium(III)
acetylacetonate, and 150 μL of in-house synthetized 31P reagent66 (2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaphospholane).
All samples were measured right after the addition of 31P reagent. The quantitative 31P NMR measurements were
performed using a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz equipped with a Bruker
5 mm BBO probe. A total of 200 scans were recorded at 23 °C using
Bruker’s standard pulse program zg with a 90° pulse angle,
1.625 s acquisition time, and 5 s relaxation delay. All spectra were
calibrated using a H2O signal at 132.2 ppm as a reference.
Gained data was processed with Bruker TopSpin 4.0.2 software. The
following integration regions were used to determine the abundance
of different OH groups: internal standard, 152.4–151.5 ppm;
aliphatic OH, 149–145 ppm; condensed phenolic OH, 145–140.4
ppm; noncondensed phenolic OH, 140.4–137.2 ppm; COOH, 134–136
ppm. These integration regions are suitable for softwood lignins,
which do not contain syringyl OH groups.

TGA
Thermogravimetry
was used to study thermal degradation
of samples. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e/SF/1100 with Julabo cooler
model ED was used. Onset values were determined using STARe software
version 9.01. Raw data was imported to MS Excel from which TGA curves
were constructed. Sample sizes were 9–12 mg in reusable 70
μL alumina crucibles with lids. The temperature program used
a ramp speed of 10 °C min–1 and nitrogen flow
of 50 mL min–1. An annealing cycle was used for
all samples as pretreatment and consisted of the following segments:
ramp to 105 °C, isothermal 20 min, ramp to 60 °C, and isothermal
2 min. It was followed by the measurement cycle, which was simply
ramp to 800 °C. The onset temperature, thermal stability, and
residual mass were analyzed. Precursor fiber samples were molded into
pans by threading a needle, spinning 8–12 turns around the
needle, pulling the knot through the line, tightening the knot, and
cutting the knot into a cylindrical structure.

DSC
Glass transition temperatures (Tg’s)
of samples were determined using a TA Instruments
Q200 DSC coupled to a RCS90 cooling system. Raw data was exported
from TA Universal Analysis 2000 software and imported to MS Excel
from which DSC curves were drawn. Sample sizes were 7–10 mg
in aluminum hermetic pans and lids with two self-drilled holes (diameter,
0.28 mm). The temperature program induced a ramp speed of 10 °C
min–1 and nitrogen flow of 50 mL min–1. All samples were pretreated with an annealing cycle: ramp to 105
°C and isothermal for 20 min. This was followed by heating cycles
up to 190 °C for lignins and 260 °C for precursor fibers
with starting temperatures ranging between −50 and +30 °C.
Heating cycle ramps were the dominant source of Tg for samples and were recorded on the second heating
cycle after first erasing the thermal history on the first heating
cycle. The Tg for lignin samples was defined
as one-half the change in heat capacity occurring over the transition.

Precursor Fibers
The preparation of ionic liquid (IL)
and dope and the fiber spinning were done with the Ioncell process
and performed according to previously published methods, with only
minor modifications.38,67 The 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene-1-ium
acetate ([DBNH]OAc) IL was always prepared on the same day as the
dope preparation. Cellulose and lignin were dissolved in the IL in
a kneader at 80 °C for 90 min. The applied pressure was 10 ±
2 mbar, and the mixing speed was 30 rpm. The dissolved cellulose–lignin
mixtures (dopes) were filtered using a filter press with a filter
pore size of 5 μm. The filtered dope was spun using a piston
spinning unit (Fourné Polymertechnik, Germany). A spinneret
with 400 holes, a capillary diameter of 100 μm, and L/D 0.2
was used. The extrusion rate was 5.5 mL min–1 and
the dope temperature was 75 ± 4 °C. After spinning, the
fibers were washed with tap water (10 ± 0.25 min; water temperature,
68 ± 3 °C; air drying, 80 °C) using a custom-made washing
machine.

Carbohydrate and Lignin Analysis
The sample preparation
for carbohydrate and lignin analyses were made according to NREL/TP-510-42618,
and the samples were analyzed using an ICS-3000 HPAEC-PAD with a Dionex
CarboPac PA20 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The acid-soluble
lignin (ASL) was determined by using a Shimadzu UV 2550 spectrophotometer
at 205 nm.

SEM
For cross-section imaging, the
precursor fibers
were first frozen in water solution, then submerged into liquid nitrogen
for at least 5 min, and finally fractured by hitting the cooled ice
pieces against a sharp edge. Gained cryo-fractured fibers were dried
in a hood for several days and then attached to double-angled 90°
chamfer specimen stubs using two-sided tape. Samples were gold-coated
without spinning, and images were taken with Hitachi S-4800 equipment
at 5 kV operating voltage.

Mechanical Testing
The mechanical
properties of the
precursor fibers were measured using a Favigraph single-fiber tester
(Textechno H. Stein GmbH & Co. KG, Germany) according to the standard
SFS-EN 5079 with only minor modifications. The precursor fibers were
conditioned in 20 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 2% RH overnight prior
to the mechanical testing. The following conditions were used for
the testing: load cell, 20 cN; gauge length, 20 mm; test speed, 20
mm min–1. For each sample, 20 fibers were measured.
