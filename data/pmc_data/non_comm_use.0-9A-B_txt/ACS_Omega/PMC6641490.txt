Extensive investigation
of interactions and aggregation properties
of IL + API systems is necessary to apply ionic liquids (ILs) with
different hydrophobic characteristics to drug delivery or in active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API) formulations. Therefore, this study
aims to investigate the heteroassembly between dicationic ILs ([BisOct(MIM)2][2X], in which X is Br or BF4, and [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]), both in the absence and the presence of neutral APIs
(salicylic acid, ibuprofen, and paracetamol) with different functional
groups. Isothermal titration calorimetry results demonstrate that
IL–API associations occur at very low concentrations of IL.
These results were reinforced by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
with variable collision-induced dissociation, in which the IL dication
interactions with APIs were detected. The strength of the dication–API
interaction was determined from Ecm,1/2 data. The aggregation parameters (cac, ΔGagg°,
and K) between ILs and APIs were evaluated by conductivity.
The 1H NMR data showed that differences in chemical shifts
provided relevant insights about interaction sites in both components.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
recent years, researchers have focused on solving pharmaceutical
industry issues. The main challenges in this area are polymorphism,
low bioavailability, low water solubility, degradations, and side
effects of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).1 These elements are serious obstacles for promising drugs,
which fail and are unable to be commercially distributed.2 Efforts directly associated with the fine tuning
of physicochemical properties of ionic liquids (ILs) have been made
to increase the efficacy of new substances and formulations.1 In this manner, research in this area includes
noncovalent modification of APIs, such as synthesis of multicomponent
systems (e.g., cocrystals), which are generally formed by intermolecular
interactions between an API of interest and a co-former.3−6 In an attempt to resolve these issues, ILs have been increasingly
exploited as additives in the field of pharmaceutical drug delivery.
Moreover, several studies have shown progress in the IL use in pharmaceuticals,7−11 and ILs can markedly improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
properties of drugs.1 Furthermore, ILs
act as solvents to biological systems and can both stabilize and destabilize
protein, depending on its physicochemical properties.12−14

Some studies have even demonstrated the effect of monocationic
ILs in IL + API systems or of additives in surfactants + API systems.10,11,15−20 Nevertheless, the literature on the evaluation of dicationic ILs
and the understanding of interactions in the drug delivery environments
remain scarce.21,22 Dicationic ILs consist of a doubly
charged cation linked by a spacer chain.23 These ILs with a long spacer chain (e.g., 8 and 10 carbons) possess
excellent surface activity properties and are capable of forming aggregates
in solution.24,25 Because of such characteristics,
this new class of ILs is comparable with traditional surfactants and
can be used, with advantages, in the same applications as monocationic
structures. Nevertheless, the additional cationic head of ILs can
improve physicochemical properties and, consequently, structure performance
when used as alternative solvents in reactions, separations, lubricants,
electrolytes in batteries, the stationary phase in gas chromatography
columns, and in pharmaceutical sciences.26

Because of their distinct physicochemical properties,24,25 dicationic ILs may improve API permeability across biological membranes
and increase their bioavailability and stability.15 Therefore, the elucidation of the influence of dicationic
ILs micelles in pharmaceutical sciences is of great relevance. It
has already been reported that monocationic ILs and conventional surfactants
can act as carriers in biological fluids where the API contact with
enzymes is minimized, which may increase API efficiency and reduce
side effects.11,27 Furthermore, a broad range of
studies on interactions between IL and APIs are carried out with ionic
APIs, in which the association with ILs are mostly favored by ionic
interactions.10,11,16

Our research group has already verified the influence of the
alkyl
chain length25 and the nature of the anions
in the self-aggregation behavior of dicationic IL structures in solution,23,24 in addition to evaluating thermodynamic properties of aggregation
using [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] as a study model.28 Thus, this study aims to assess if dicationic
ILs can interact with APIs in solution by investigating the following:
(i) a systematic study related to heteroassembly between IL + API
in ethanol–water solution (1:1), (ii) thermodynamic differences
in the aggregation behavior of the ILs with different structural changes
in the presence and the absence of distinct APIs, (iii) association
between these components by intermolecular interactions, and (iv)
the strength of the interactions between IL and API. The ILs and APIs
[salicylic acid (SA), paracetamol (Par), and ibuprofen (Ibu)] addressed
in this study are demonstrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 ILs and APIs used in the study.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
The interactions of
ILs and APIs were evaluated by isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) in an ethanol–water solution. The API solutions
at 3 g L–1 were titrated with IL solutions. The
curves were compared with pure IL curves, in which the solvent was
titrated with IL solution. The calorimetric titration curves of the
observed enthalpy changes (ΔHobs) as a function of the IL concentration are depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Observed enthalpy (ΔHobs) vs
concentration (C) for pure ILs and mixed ILs + APIs
obtained by nano ITC for (a) [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br], (b) [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4], and (c) [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br].

In a typical ITC experiment, when
the IL concentration of the titrated
solution is below the critical aggregation concentration (cac), the
ΔHobs is attributed to the break-up
of added aggregates into monomers and further into monomer dilution.
However, when the concentration reaches values greater than cac, the
ΔHobs only expresses the dilution
of the added micelles and usually decreases.29

In this study, we were unable to reach concentration values
above
cac because of limitation in the operational range of the equipment.
Although the range of the concentration evaluated does not include
the cac value for the IL, the ITC is a very sensitive technique capable
of predicting the occurrence of the first interactions between the
components (IL monomers and APIs molecules), which is before the IL
aggregation formation (Figure 2). As the components are injected into solvent or API solution,
endothermic changes in ΔHobs indicate
the beginning of the interaction process between IL + IL or IL + API.29 Furthermore, all the curves of IL + API systems
revealed a change in the enthalpy of the solution at each addition
of IL, in addition to presenting a distinct ΔHobs magnitude in relation to pure ILs curves (representing
the IL self-assembly).

For [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br], the
interaction with APIs has
an endothermic character in comparison with IL self-assembly. On the
other hand, for [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] and [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br], the IL–API interactions have an exothermic
behavior. This can be attributed to the great hydrophobicity of these
ILs. In general, when hydrophobic interactions occur, they lead to
a decrease in ΔHobs.30,31 Chabba et al.,29 in the titration of
three surface-active ionic liquids (SAILs) into a polymer solution
of Pluronic F108, showed that the titration of all three SAILs into
the polymeric solution resulted in endothermic heat changes when compared
to the titration of SAILs into water at 25 °C.

The curves
were treated using Carpena’s method to obtain
an association concentration (Cass) and
an association enthalpy (ΔHass).32 The slope change in the straight line of the
IL concentration as a function of ΔHobs was taken as the association concentration between IL–API
(heteroassembly) and IL–IL (self-assembly) for the systems
in both the presence and the absence of API, respectively. The curves
of [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] and pure [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] were not analyzed by Carpena’s method because
they do not have a rectangular hyperbole tendency. In this case, Cass and ΔHass were established in the intersection point between two straight
lines of the IL concentration versus the ΔHobs plot.

Nevertheless, it was not possible to estimate
the association data
(Cass and ΔHass) for [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + SA because
of the absence of an intersection point in the profile of the ITC
curve. Table 1 shows
the data acquired by ITC.

The components associate at very low concentrations.
For the pure
IL compounds, the Cass of self-assembly,
the following order was established where [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] > [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] > [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br].

Nonetheless, different tendencies were observed
for the IL + API
systems. The Cass is dependent upon the
balance between various factors, such as binding strength of the cation
with the anion and/or APIs and the electrostatic repulsion between
IL cations. Furthermore, the Cass of pure
ILs is modified in the API presence because the IL–IL intermolecular
interactions were altered by the APIs because of IL–API interactions.
Notably, the Cass of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] decreased in the presence of all APIs in this study.
For [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br], the Cass increased in the presence of APIs, and the Cass of [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] decreased
in the presence of ibuprofen and paracetamol.

Significant changes
in Cass occurred
in all systems, which indicates that each association is dependent
on a particular IL + API combination. In addition, an important trend
can be observed; for IL short side alkyl chain (methyl in [BisOct(MIM)2][2X], in which X = Br and BF4), the Cass decreases in the presence of APIs, indicating that
IL + API interactions are favored. On the other hand, for [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br], which has a bulky side alkyl chain, the Cass increases in the presence of APIs, which indicates
that [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] + API interactions are delayed
in relation to IL monomer interactions.

In general, an increase
was observed in the ΔHass for [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + API. However,
a decrease of ΔHass was observed
for [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] and [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] in the presence of APIs. These results indicate a complex
balance of interactions between ILs and APIs because the ΔHass values show a distinct behavior according
to the system observed. This is expected because the APIs in this
study have different functional groups in their structures (SA: carboxylic
acid and phenol; Par: amide and phenol; Ibu: carboxylic acid) that
will interact with ILs in a particular way. Furthermore, ILs show
different hydrophobicity degrees that ensure these differences in
the ΔHass.

By observing the
results from the API point of view, it is possible
to ascertain that the different ILs produce curves of different magnitudes
of ΔHass versus C in the presence of API, although the order is always preserved (see
the Supporting Information, Figure S1).
As previously observed for pure IL systems, [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] also demonstrates a more exothermic behavior, followed by
[BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] and [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] in the presence of different APIs. These tendencies denote
important considerations: (i) all APIs used as models in this study
exhibit intermolecular interactions with ILs of distinct hydrophobicity
degrees because the presence of API promotes significant changes in
ΔHass values; (ii) the IL–IL
associations are broken to form new favored IL–API interactions;
(iii) IL–API first interactions are driven by the IL structure
because the IL order for ΔHass magnitude
is the same for different APIs (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1). Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider
that the APIs evaluated demonstrated an important role in modulating
the IL–IL association properties. These results corroborate
with the recent investigation by Pal and Yadav,16 which showed the pivotal role of lidocaine hydrochloride
in modulating aggregation properties of monocationic ILs [DoDec(MIM)][Cl]
and [TetDec(MIM)][Cl] (in which DoDec and TetDec correspond to the
alkyl chain of 12 and 14 carbons, respectively). However, this interaction
can be quite different because this system is composed of a mixture
of salts (both IL and API are charged).

2.2 Electrospray
Ionization Tandem Mass Spectra
Electrospray ionization tandem
mass spectra (ESI-MS-MS) was used
to verify the relative abundance of IL–API associations as
a function of the applied collision-induced dissociation (CID). Separation
of the IL–API system, as the collision energy increases, produced
different positively charged units. The percentage of fragment ion
abundance in relation to the total ion abundance (I/∑I) was plotted versus the center-of-mass
system (Ecm). The results were presented
as breakdown curves.33 The Ecm values were calculated according to eq 1.34 1  

In eq 1, Elab, mt, and mp are the laboratory
frame collision energy, mass of the target gas, and mass of the precursor
ion, respectively.34,35 A decrease of the precursor ion
abundance was observed as the Ecm increases.
This indicates that the precursor ion tends to break up as the collision
energy increases.

Solutions of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br],
[BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4], and [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] with different
APIs in ethanol–water solution (1:1, v/v) were evaluated in
the positive ion mode using the scan mode. These data indicate that
the ILs–APIs are preorganized in solutions where the interactions
between them are maintained as the sample passes from the liquid to
the gas phase. In this study, the analysis was carried out at a lower
concentration (2 mM of each component in final solution), which is
comparable with the concentration range evaluated by ITC. This is
possible because of the high sensibility of the ESI-MS-MS equipment.
The self-organization of dicationic ILs with different anions in solution
was previously described by our research group in greater concentrations.24 Recently, we published a study in which the
dicationic IL cation–anion interactions forces were evaluated
by this technique.36 Currently, the objective
is to use ESI-MS-MS to show the heteroassociation occurrence between
dicationic ILs and APIs at very low concentrations and to estimate
the interaction strength between these components.

The positive
ion mode mass spectra of the ILs demonstrated the
precursor ion [BisOct(MIM)2API]+ (in which API
corresponds to an anion of the pharmaceutical molecule). The association
[BisOct(MIM)2API]+ was submitted to different Elab values until the complete dication-anion
dissociation (eq 2) was
observed. The anion corresponds to APIs evaluated in this study. 2  

With the increase of the Ecm,
several
cationic units were observed for all ILs of this study. These units
are produced by [BisOct(MIM)2API]+ fragmentation.
The spectrum generated by combining all 30 spectra obtained in the
CID range of 0–30 eV for [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ (m/z 413) can be observed in Figure 3. This figure is
a graphical representation of the relative abundance distribution
of species observed in the [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ fragmentation from the [BisOct(MIM)2][BF4]
+ SA system. The breakdown curves of the major ions observed in the
spectrum of [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ and [BisOct(MIM)2Ibu]+ from [BisOct(MIM)2][BF4] + SA and [BisOct(MIM)2][BF4] + Ibu systems,
respectively, are detailed in Figure 4. The breakdown curves of other IL + APIs species can
be found in the Supporting Information.

Figure 3 Graphical
representation of the sum of the 30 spectra in the CID
range of 0–30 eV for [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ (m/z 413).

Figure 4 Breakdown curves for several m/z ratios of associations formed from (a) [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + SA and (b) [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4]
+ Ibu.

Figure 3 demonstrates
that [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ (m/z 413) and [BisOct(MIM)2]2+ (m/z 275) are abundant species of the [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + SA solution. The peak in m/z 193 can be attributed to a monocation, i.e.,
dication without an imidazolium ring. Figure 4a demonstrates that the dication [BisOct(MIM)2]2+ is formed from [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ fragmentation because a decrease in the [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ abundance is followed by an increase in the
[BisOct(MIM)2]2+ abundance. In Ecm values over 0.5 eV, it becomes clear that the cation
with 193 m/z is exclusively formed
from [BisOct(MIM)2]2+ because its abundance
increases with the decline of the dication m/z intensity. This can be related to the loss of an imidazole
ring from dication [BisOct(MIM)2]2+. This behavior
is an indication that the fragmentation process, in this case, occurs
by the sequential loss of the pharmaceutical in the anionic form and
then fragmentation of the cation.

The breakdown curves of [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + Ibu can be observed in Figure 4b, in which the fragmentation
sequences are the same.
However, the [BisOct(MIM)2Ibu]+ species is about
30% less abundant (less stable) than [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+. This indicates that the [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] has more affinity for SA than for Ibu in the ethanol–water
solution. In both cases, the small abundance of 178 m/z can be attributed to a methyl unit loss from
193 m/z and may be observed in higher
energy values (above 1.5 eV).

The breakdown curve pattern for
others systems showed a behavior
analogous to [BisOct(MIM)2SA]+ and [BisOct(MIM)2Ibu]+ (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4). Fragmentations also occur initially in the cation–anion
species and then in the dication, as the collision energy increases.
The main fragments in the dication species were observed in all cases.
Once again, when the I/∑I of dication reaches a maximum value, the loss of the imidazolium
ring notably increases.

From the breakdown graphs, the energy
value corresponding to 50%
of relative abundance of the precursor ion (Ecm,1/2) was obtained for all [BisOct(MIM)2X]+ species. The Ecm,1/2 can be used
to measure the relative dissociation energy, in addition to being
a well-established research strategy regarding the relative binding
energies/stabilities of several systems.35,37,38 The Ecm,1/2 observed
for the [BisOct(MIM)X]+ species is shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Ecm,1/2 Values for IL + API Systems
system	Ecm,1/2 (kJ mol–1)	
[BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + Ibu	9.301	
[BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + SA	21.401	
[BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] + Ibu	8.857	
[BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] + SA	20.532	
[BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + Ibu	8.877	
[BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + SA	18.487	
The Ecm,1/2 values
for the species
containing IL and Ibu (∼9 kJ mol–1) were
lower than the IL–SA systems (∼20 kJ mol–1). These results indicate that dicationic ILs can interact more strongly
with SA than Ibu. Despite [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] having demonstrated
some hindrance to interact with API based on Cass and cac data, in this evaluation, this IL demonstrated
an interaction energy comparable with [BisOct(MIM)2][2X]
+ SA (X = Br and BF4). It is reasonable to believe that
this IL can interact better with SA than other APIs in this study.
This result corroborates with cac values, in which the cac for [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] in the presence of SA is close to cac values of pure
[BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]. This indicates that the presence
of SA does not promote significant delay in the aggregation process
of [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] in solution than Ibu and Par, in
which the cac is altered around 15 mM. Because the associations of
dicationic ILs and paracetamol were observed by ESI-MS-MS only in
low intensities, the CID evaluations, to construct breakdown curves,
were not realized for these systems.

2.3 Conductivity
Aggregation parameters
of ILs can be obtained both in the presence and the absence of APIs
using electrical conductivity. The main parameter is the cac, which
indicates the concentration in which the aggregates begin to form.
The cac values of ILs were evaluated in the absence and the presence
of Ibu, Par, and SA and were obtained by applying Carpena’s
method32 in the conductivity (κ)
versus IL concentration (C) plots (Figures 5 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The correlation coefficient (r) of the fitting obtained by this method demonstrated values close
to 1. Figure 5 demonstrates
the electrical conductivity curves of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br]
and [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + APIs in solution.

Figure 5 Conductivity vs concentration
(C) for pure [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] and systems
with APIs.

Figure 5 demonstrates
that the κ versus C curves for [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + Par and [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + Ibu are
similar to [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] in solution, while [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + SA has a distinct behavior. This can be attributed
to a greater capacity of charge conduction of the [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + SA system in relation to other systems in the study.

Researchers have been studying IL interactions and aggregation
properties in the presence of APIs in the salt form.16,39 It was showed that ILs can have several possible interactions with
the APIs, hydrogen bonding, π···π staking,
lone pair···π, dipolar, and ionic/charge–charge
interactions.40,41 The APIs addressed herein are
neutral to reduce the possibility of electrostatic interactions between
ions and to maximize the probability of interactions of the noncovalent
nature such as hydrogen bonding, π···π-staking,
as well as to verify if these interactions can occur between charged
ILs and neutral APIs.

The ionization (α) degree of the
aggregates can also be obtained
using Carpena’s method.42,43 This parameter indicates
the proportion of free ions in solution. The standard Gibbs free energy
of aggregation (ΔGagg°) and the aggregation equilibrium
constant (K) were acquired based on the mass-action
model considering bolaform surfactants for calculation purposes,44 which is frequently used to elucidate the IL
aggregation process. The parameters obtained from the conductivity
measurements are summarized in Table 3.

The
following cac order was observed for pure ILs (Table 2): [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br]
> [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] > [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]. This order follows the same one observed for ITC for
the
first IL–IL interactions. As previously published by our research
group, the aggregation behavior of dicationic ILs is closely related
to IL hydrophobicity.24 In this study,
the [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] has the lower cac value that can
be attributed to the additional hydrophobicity of the structure caused
by the presence of benzyl rings bonded to N3 of imidazolium rings.
In addition, these aromatic rings can act in π···π,
CH···π, cation···π, or anion···π41,45,46 interactions at the aggregate
interface, contributing to the reduced cac value. The degree of ionization
is also reduced in comparison with [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] (in
which X = Br and BF4). This indicates that a great proportion
of anions are better stabilized on the aggregate surface. Ao et al.47 demonstrated from surface tension data that
dicationic ILs with different size alkyl spacer chains (2, 4 and 6
carbons) and long side alkyl chains (12 carbons) present very low
cac (0.75–0.78 mM). This can be attributed to the considerable
hydrophobic character of ILs conferred by the side alkyl chain. When
the side alkyl chain is short, the cac generally occurs at higher
values.25

In general, pure ILs have
greater cac values than IL + API systems.
This indicates that the IL aggregation ability is improved with the
presence of API (Table 3). The headgroup–headgroup repulsions in the IL aggregate
formation are probably reduced because of the additional stabilization
of APIs on the aggregate surface. This behavior has already been reported
by Mahajan et al.11 and is related to the
fact that these APIs are small polar organic compounds that adsorb
mainly in the outer portion of the micelle, close to the water–aggregate
interface.

Adsorption of the additives in this manner decreases
the energy
required for aggregation. This assumption is supported by IL ΔGagg° values that become smaller in the presence of pharmaceuticals, proving
that aggregation is favored. The higher K values
show that the equilibrium toward aggregation is also favored in the
presence of API. Nevertheless, for [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]
+ API (Ibu, Par), K values were inferior (higher
cac values) than the values for pure [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br].
In this case, the presence of a benzyl unit bonded to the imidazolium
ring can promote an additional steric hindrance between the IL monomers
and API molecules at aggregate interfaces, thus slowing the aggregation
process. Pal et al.16 recently evaluated
binding interactions of the anesthetic drug lidocaine hydrochloride
with SAILs and found that cac decreases as the concentration of the
drug increases. The authors attributed this cac reduction to the presence
of cation−π interactions between the imidazolium ring
of the SAIL and the drug molecules. In our study, the benzyl group
bonded with the imidazolium ring in [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]
hinders this type of interaction.

2.4 1H NMR
The interactions
of APIs (SA, Ibu, and Par) with the dicationic ILs were also visible
from the 1H NMR spectra. The changes in the chemical shift
values (δ) in the IL + API spectra in relation to separated
compounds, under the same conditions, allow us to establish the nature
of IL and API interactions in the different systems evaluated.11,39 The changes in the 1H δ of IL and API are shown
in Figure 6a fand Figure 6b for the BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + SA system in aromatic and aliphatic 1H
resonance regions, respectively. The signals in δ close to 7.3
and 3.3 are attributed to CDCl3 and CD3OD residual
peaks, respectively.

Figure 6 Comparison between chemical shifts of [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br]
+ SA (red), [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] (green), and SA (blue)
in (a) aromatic and (b) aliphatic regions.

In the 1H NMR of the IL + API systems, changes
can be
observed in the chemical shift of the API and cationic heads of the
IL 1H signals. This indicates that the API probably interacts
with the polar portion of dicationic ILs. This observation suggests
that in the aggregate phase formed by these ILs, the APIs (SA, Par,
and Ibu) should interact on the aggregate surface, as already reported
in the literature for other IL + API systems.11,18 The Δδ (δbonded – δfree) represents the variation in the chemical shifts of the
analyzed nuclei. The APIs signals were attributed according to refs.48−50

The presence of SA greatly effects the environment of surfactant
protons, especially the hydrogen close or directly bonded to the head
group. The deshielding effect of H4 and H5 may result from hydrogen-bonding
interactions between these H with SA, probably with a carbonyl group
of SA. The H2 of the imidazolium ring shows a high field shift (shielding
effect), which is likely due to the breaking of the H2···A– interactions in the presence of SA. Furthermore, H2
can be shielded by magnetic effects from aromatic rings (from IL and/or
API). These IL Δδ values confirm the interaction between
IL and API molecules that lead to the heteroassembly of IL and API
molecules in solution.

Mehta et al.39 have found that the presence
of diclofenac sodium greatly effects the environment of ammonium surfactant
(DDAB and DTAC) protons, especially the protons in close proximity
to the head group. Moreover, the significant changes in δ confirmed
the interaction between the drug and surfactant molecules at the micelles
surface in solution.

In a recent study, our research group observed
the effect of the
IL anion in the interactions on the surface of aggregates in a solution
of 4.75% of ethanol in water (v/v). The study showed that [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] (in which X = Br and BF4) forms spherical
aggregates. Furthermore, it was found that alkyl chains are folded
and cationic heads interact by CH···π at the
aggregate surface.23 We expect dicationic
IL aggregates in an ethanol–water solution (1–1, v/v)
to be organized in a similar way, including [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]. Therewithal, it can be concluded that API molecules can strongly
affect the interactions between cationic heads when compared with
self-assembly, in which the head groups organize themselves to interact
effectively with APIs. The hydrogens of the alkyl chain (H12, H13,
and H14) were omitted for better visualization of the affected signals
because of the insignificant Δδ in the presence of SA.
The signal in 3.9 ppm in the SA spectra can be attributed to the exchange
reaction between CD3OD and hydrogen of SA carboxylic acid.
The signal in 4.9 ppm in the [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + SA spectra
can be attributed to the same exchange reaction or residual water
present in the sample.

H11 shows upfield shift because of the
increased shielding effect
from the imidazolium ring. In this case, the API interacts with cationic
heads, making more compact the IL alkyl spacer chain, thus generating
the shielding effect. Nevertheless, the shielding in H31 can be related
to CH···π interactions, in which H31 is the hydrogen
donor of the interaction. The same chemical shift behavior was observed
for [BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + Ibu and [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + Par systems.

On the other hand, in the
[BisOct(MIM)2][2Br] + Par,
[BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + SA, and [BisOct(MIM)2][2BF4] + Ibu systems, the H4 and H5 shift upfield,
as does H2. In this case, all hydrogen atoms of imidazolium rings
are in the shielding cone of API and are not H-bond donors. This behavior
shows that the interactions in these systems are complex and dependent
on both IL and API, as previously observed in ITC and conductivity
measurements. The spectra of other IL + API systems are depicted in
the Supporting Information. Notably, the 1H spectra of [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] + API demonstrate
minor δ changes in relation to separated compounds, with the
exception of H2 of ILs. As previously observed from ITC and conductivity
results, the presence of a benzyl unit bonded in the imidazolium ring
confers a greater hydrophobic character to [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br], thus promoting lower Cass and
cac self-assembly values. On the other hand, in heteroassembly, the
benzyl group on the surface of the aggregate can hinder interactions
between the IL monomers and the API molecules, delaying the aggregation
process. For this reason, [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] + API interactions
may be more difficult to be detected by NMR, and only stronger H-bonds
were observed in the concentration evaluated.

3 Conclusions
From the several techniques applied in this
investigation, it was
possible to demonstrate that dicationic ILs of different hydrophobicities
can effectively interact with APIs of different natures. From ITC,
we were able to show that the Cass (initial
IL + API associations) is reduced for [BisOct(MIM)2][2X]
(in which X = Br and BF4) in the presence of APIs, whereas
it is increased for [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br]. Different tendencies
were observed for ΔHass depending
on the IL + API combination. These results indicate a complex balance
of interactions between ILs and APIs. Nevertheless, IL + API first
interactions are driven by the IL structure because the ILs maintain
the same order of ΔHass magnitude
for different APIs.

The conductivity data provided information
about the aggregation
behavior of ILs in the absence and the presence of APIs. Furthermore,
cac decreased in the presence of APIs for [BisOct(MIM)2][2X] (in which X = Br and BF4) and increased for [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br], revealing the same tendency of the Cass data. When the cac decreased, the ΔGagg° and K presented lower and higher values, respectively, demonstrating
that heteroassembly IL–API is favored when compared with IL
self-assembly.

From ESI-MS-MS, the species [BisOct(MIM)2X]+ (in which X = API) were detected in the positive
ion mode. Breakdown
curves of these species were constructed, and dication–API
interaction strength values were provided based on the Ecm,1/2 data. This is the first time that IL + API systems
were detected in an equimolar mixture and the strength of dication–API
interactions were quantitatively characterized. Results evidenced
that, in general, dicationic ILs interact more strongly with SA (∼21
kJ mol–1) than with Ibu (∼8 kJ mol–1).

1H NMR spectral data proves the occurrence of
interactions
between IL and API because of the considerable changes in the chemical
shifts of the systems related to separate compounds. Because of the
great δ changes of 1H IL cationic heads, it is suggested
that the different APIs interact with IL cationic heads in ethanol–water
solution. The [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] demonstrates more changes
in δ for H2 of ILs (H acid) and OH of APIs, thus indicating
that [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] + API interactions occur mainly
in these sites. The complementary techniques provided very important
insights regarding IL + API heteroassembly.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
1,8-Dibromooctane, 1-methylimidazole,
1-benzylimidazole, and sodium tetrafluoroborate were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Acetonitrile, ethyl ether, and
absolute ethanol were purchased from Tedia (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil).
All chemical products were of high-grade purity and used without further
purification.

4.2 Synthesis
The
ILs were synthesized
in accordance with methodologies previously described in the literature.24,51 The structures of all products were confirmed by NMR and mass spectra.
The characterization data of [BisOct(MIM)2][2X], in which
X = Br and BF4, are depicted in the refs (24) and (51). Characterization data
of [BisOct(BnIM)2][2Br] in DMSO-d6 are depicted in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Solution Preparation
IL solutions
were prepared by weighing the compound (IL or API) in a volumetric
flask and using an analytical scale with ±0.001 g (Marte AL 500,
Brazil). The volumetric flask was filled with an ethanol–water
solution (1:1, v/v). The water used to prepare the solutions was double-distilled
and deionized using Millipore quality water (Elix-03, Barueri, Brazil;
and Milli-Q, Molsheim, France). The absolute ethanol HPLC grade was
acquired from Tedia Brazil.

4.4 Electrical Conductivity
Conductivity
was measured using a Digimed DM-3P conductivity meter (DMC-100M) operating
with a cell constant of 10 cm–1. The conductivity
meter was calibrated with KCl solution (0.1 mol L–1). The solutions of pure IL and IL + API were thermostated in the
cell at 25 ± 0.1 °C. In the mixtures, the API concentration
was kept constant at 3 g L–1. The stock solution
of IL (1000 mM) in ethanol–water solution (1:1, v/v) was progressively
added into an API solution in ethanol–water solution (1:1,
v/v) at 3 g L–1 to obtain the desired IL concentration.
After each addition of IL, the mixture was homogenized and the conductivity
measured after the temperature was stabilized. The conductivity of
the solutions was measured in a large concentration range of IL to
clearly observe the cac.

4.5 ESI-MS-MS Measurements
ESI-MS-MS
were acquired with an Agilent Technologies 6460 triple quadruple mass
spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) operating in the positive ion
mode. The gas temperature was 300 °C, the flow of the drying
gas was 5 L min–1, and the nebulizer was set to
45 psi. The voltage of the capillary was 3500 V, whereas the voltage
of the fragmentor was 0 V. The injection volume of the IL + API (2
mM) solutions was 5 μL. Nitrogen was used as both nebulization
gas and collision gas. A tetrahydrofuran–methanol (1:1, v/v)
solution was used as the mobile phase. The mass spectra were recorded
in a range of CID values to promote the dissociation of the species.
The intensity of the precursor ion as a function of the CID values
provides the collision–energy–dissociation profiles.

4.6 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Calorimetric
measurements were carried out using a MicroCal iTC 200
from GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Fairfield, Connecticut, EUA) at
25 °C (±0.1). The syringe was filled (38 μM) with
IL (50 mM) in an ethanol–water (1:1, v/v) solution. Aliquots
of 2 μM were added into the sample cell filled with 200 μL
of solvent (pure ethanol–water solution—1:1, v/v) or
API solution (3 g L–1) to observe the enthalpy behavior
versus the concentration of IL in the absence and the presence of
API, respectively. The measurements were carried out with an initial
delay of 60 s and a spacing time (between each injection) of 150 s.

4.7 NMR
1H spectra were recorded
on Bruker AVANCE III (1H at 600.13 MHz) equipped with a
BCU II unit as a cooling/heating system for the probe (temperature
of 25 °C). The IL + API systems for 1H NMR analysis
were synthesized by solubilizing IL and API in an equimolar ratio
in 4 mL of ethanol–water solution (1:1, v/v). The samples were
stirred at 40 °C until complete solvent evaporation and maintained
under high vacuum at 25 °C for 3 days. Then, the samples were
placed in 5 mm tubes with a 10% solution of CD3OD in CDCl3 (50 mM). This CDCl3 solution was used to minimize
the possibility of interaction breaking by polar protic solvents.
The amount of CD3OD used to solubilize the samples was
minimal.
