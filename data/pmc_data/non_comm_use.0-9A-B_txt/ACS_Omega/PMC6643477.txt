A series of linear benzofuran
derivatives consisting of either
a vinylene or a cyanovinylene were prepared in order to investigate
their emission properties. The X-ray crystallography of structurally
similar derivatives was also evaluated. The crystalline structures
of the vinylene derivatives showed only lateral contacts that involved
the benzofurans and no π-stacking. In contrast, π-stacking
was observed for the bisbenzofuran and benzofuran-phenyl
cyanovinylene derivatives. No intermolecular π–π
stacking was observed for the extended cyanovinylene structures.
Intermolecular bonding between the nitrile and a furan atom
was found. The fluorescence quantum yields (Φfl)
of the vinylene derivatives were consistently high (>50%) in both
solution and the crystal state. The exception was the benzofuran-furan-vinylene-phenyl,
the Φfl of which was <10% when in the solid state.
The cyanovinylene counterparts emitted weakly in solution (Φfl < 2%). Their luminogenic property was demonstrated with
a ca. 15-fold increase in emission in the solid state. A 6-fold emission
enhancement was also found when they were aggregated in a 90 vol%
methanol/water mixture. The solid-state emission enhancement of the
cyanovinylene benzofurans was in part attributable to
intermolecular contacts that suppressed excited-state deactivation
by molecular motion.

Introduction
Fluorophores having
emission that is enhanced when they are either
aggregated or in the solid state can be defined as luminogens. All-organic
luminogens that are highly emissive in the solid state are of interest
for using in various optoelectronic applications, such as organic
light-emitting diodes and solid-state lasers.1 Both the emission efficiency and the emission wavelength of π-conjugated
materials in the solid state are contingent on molecular structures.
Their photophysical properties are also highly influenced by intermolecular
interactions that take place between neighboring molecules in the
solid state.2

Recent advances in
aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have established
certain luminogen design criteria.3 In
general, the emission can be enhanced by restricting molecular motion
(RMM).4 Enhancement in the solid-state
emission can also be achieved by limiting the intermolecular
π-stacking of luminogens.5 This occurs
by engaging both intra- and intermolecular supramolecular
interactions.

Furans have recently emerged as interesting fluorophores
because
of their strong intrinsic emission.6 In
fact, fluorescence quantum yields (Φfl) upward of
50% in solution have been reported for oligofurans of varying degrees
of oligomerization, ranging from a trimer to a nonamer.7 The high emission is in part due to the rigidity
of the conjugated structure, which prevents nonradiative deactivation
processes, such as out-of-plane vibration.6,8 The
high emission is in contrast to the observation with thiophenes, the
singlet excited state of which is quenched by intersystem crossing
(ISC) upon photoexcitation.9 While benzofuran
is structurally similar to furan, its fused phenyl-furan structural
is more rigid, making it highly emissive.10 For example, the Φfl of BF1, consisting
of two benzofurans covalently connected to a central furan (Figure 1), was 71% in solution,11 and that of its anthryl counterpart, BF5, was 43%.12

Figure 1 Benzofuran luminogens
previously reported.13,14

The crystalline structures adopted by benzofurans in
the
solid state are also factors that contribute to their luminogen behavior.
For example, the linear BF2 derivative was found to form
a herringbone arrangement in the solid state.13 This supramolecular structure suppressed intermolecular π-stacking,
which is an efficient mode of fluorescence deactivation, resulting
in Φfl = 75%. This is in contrast to its star (BF3) and cruciform (BF4) counterparts that π–π
stack and have solid-state emissions reduced by 30 and 80%, respectively,
compared to that of BF2. Luminogens having solid-state
emission are therefore made possible by engineering intermolecular
contacts that suppress unwanted fluorescence quenching modes, such
as π-stacking.14

While the
molecular-level requirements for AIE are well-established,3,4 the supramolecular luminogen design principles for solid-state
emission enhancement remain relatively underexplored.15 Within this context, the benzofuran series 1–7 (Figure 2) was prepared as luminogens to contribute
to unraveling the supramolecular/emission enhancement factors.
The benzofuran was targeted as the common framework because
of its intrinsic fluorescence. Meanwhile, the relative ease of synthesizing
the series allows access to a range of structurally variable counterparts.
Their relative small size, linearity, and overall degree of conjugation
were expected to result in their high degree of crystallinity. This,
in turn, would provide key information about the structural effects,
such as the roles of (i) cyanovinylene, (ii) the type of terminal
aromatic, and (iii) the furan spacer, on modulating the solid-state
emission enhancement. As such, the crystallography and both the solution
and solid-state emission of 1–7 are
herein presented.

enhancement.

Results and Discussion
Luminogen
Preparation
The luminogens 1–7 were prepared according to Scheme S1. 1 was prepared in 70% yield by McMurry
coupling of 2-benzofuran carbaldehyde. The other compounds were
prepared by either Knoevenagel condensations or Wittig–Horner
reactions from the corresponding aldehydes. 3 and 5 were prepared by Wittig–Horner reaction by adding
a slight excess of tBuONa to a stoichiometric
amount of the corresponding aldehyde and phosphonate. The resulting E isomers of 3 and 5 were isolated
in 45 and 65% yield, respectively. The Knoevenagel condensations between
the corresponding aldehyde and acetonitrile derivatives were done
at room temperature in EtOH with a catalytic amount of tBuONa. The resulting precipitate was washed with
a small amount of EtOH to afford 2, 4, 6, and 7 as microcrystalline powders in
55–70% yields.

The identity of each compound and their
corresponding reagents was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (1H NMR spectra of 1–7 are presented
in Figures S3, S5, S7, S9, S11, S13, and S15). More specifically, coupling constants of 16 and 15.5 Hz were respectively
measured for the vinylic protons by 1H NMR for the asymmetric
luminogens 3 and 5. The coupling constants
are consistent with an E isomer of the unsaturated
bond. In contrast, only one signal was observed for the vinylic protons
for the symmetric 1 and the cyanovinyl derivatives 2, 4, 6, and 7. This
is consistent with a single isomer. An exact number of carbons was
observed for all the compounds in the 13C NMR spectra (13C NMR spectra of 1–7 are
presented in Figures S4, S6, S8, S10, S12, S14, and S16). This, taken together with the single vinylene proton
peak, provides sound evidence for only one configurational vinylene
isomer being formed. However, the E and Z configurations of 1 and the cyanovinyl derivatives
cannot unequivocally be confirmed exclusively with the NMR data.

All the luminogens prepared were analyzed by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction, in part to assign the absolute configuration of the vinylene.
The E configuration of the vinylene segment of 1, 3, and 5 was confirmed by the
X-ray data. Similarly, the Z configuration of the
cyanovinylene fragment of 2, 4, 6 and 7 was confirmed by the crystallographic
data (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Resolved X-ray
crystallographic structures of 1–7 showing their configuration adopted in the solid state and
the dihedral angle of the vinyl-phenyl planes.

The diffraction studies were most importantly undertaken
to evaluate
the solid-state intra- and inter-supramolecular interactions of the
vinyl and cyanovinyl derivatives. These non-covalent contacts are
of particular interest because the emission properties of conjugated
materials in the solid state are known to strongly correlate with
their packing modes.16 Making such correlations
was possible with the compounds studied, owing to their crystals being
void of any included solvent. The crystals were therefore structurally
robust, and they could be handled for photophysical measurements without
compromising their structural integrity. Although the compounds examined
were different and were expected to have different crystal structures,
general trends from the X-ray data could nonetheless be drawn. For
example, the aromatics and the vinylene moieties of all the compounds
examined were found to be coplanar. The planes described by the benzofuran
and furan of the more extended structures (5–7) were also coplanar. The furans adopted an anti orientation with respect to the benzofuran. The crystallographic
data confirmed that the benzofurans of 7 were perfectly
coplanar and also coplanar with respect to the unsaturated bond that
links them. In contrast, the phenyl of 6 was twisted
by 35° from the plane defined by the furan and the cyanovinylene.
For 5, the similar dihedral angle was twisted by only
7°.

The crystal packing obtained from the single-crystal
X-ray crystallographic
data is of importance for confirming both intra- and intermolecular
interactions. For example, both 1 and 3 have
common stacking modes. They have intermolecular interactions that
occur at distances less than 3.5 Å (green dotted lines Figure 4). These correspond
to lateral contacts between the phenyl and the benzofuran atoms.
Although 1 and 3 had similar intermolecular
contacts, they differed in their crystal packing. In the case of 1, the contacts occurred cofacially between adjacent molecules
that were offset from each other. The contacts occurred between the
longitudinal termini of adjacent molecules for 3. Additional
intermolecular contacts occurred between adjacent molecules within
the unit cell of 1 and 3. These are represented
by the blue lines in Figure 4. Despite their packing modes and intermolecular contacts,
no discernible π-stacking occurred in the solid state for 1 and 3. In contrast, cofacially overlapping
interatomic distances less than 3.5 Å (green dotted lines in Figure 4) were found for 2 and 4. These attributes are consistent with
π-stacking modes. The nitrogen atom of each of the nitriles
was also found to hydrogen bond with the vinylic hydrogen atom of
an adjacent molecule (orange dotted lines Figure 4c,d). The hydrogen bond distances (dN–H) were calculated to be 2.68 and 2.57
Å for 2 and 4, respectively.

Figure 4 Stacking modes
of 1 (a), 3 (b), 2 (c), and 4 (d) assigned from the X-ray crystallographic
data.

The crystallographic data confirmed
that subtle structural differences,
such as the nitrile substituted vinylene of 3 compared
to 1, have resounding effects on the supramolecular arrangement.
This was also the case for 5–7. Similar
to 1–4, 5–7 also exhibited intermolecular contacts. These involved multiple
contacts between the benzofurans of one molecule and the furan
of another molecule in the unit cell (green lines Figure 5). These inter-heteroatomic
contact distances were found to be less than 3.5 Å. 5–7 were further found to pack into columns. The
molecules in each column were shifted and they did not perfectly overlap
cofacially. The nitriles of the cyanovinylene were also found
to hydrogen bond. In the case of 6, the nitrile hydrogen
bonded with a furan atom of a different molecule in the unit cell.
The dN–H bond was calculated to
be 2.64 Å. The similar hydrogen bond (dN–H) of 7 was slightly longer at 2.72 Å
(orange lines Figure 5c). The collective single-crystal X-ray data confirmed that intermolecular
contacts indeed occurred in the solid state of 1–7. These were expected to influence the emission properties
of the luminogens. Emission differences were therefore expected between
the solid state, where the intramolecular contacts are prevalent,
and in dilute solution, where such contacts are nonexistent.

and intramolecular contacts identified from the
single-crystal X-ray data of 5 (a), 6 (b),
and 7 (c).

Theoretical Calculations
The electronic properties
of the molecules 1–7 were evaluated
by gas-phase DFT theoretical calculations. These were done to validate
both the X-ray crystallographic data and to bridge the effects of
structure on the spectroscopic properties (vide infra). The HOMO and
LUMO energy levels were calculated from the fully optimized geometries
(see Table S3). The planes described by
the aromatics and the vinylene of the luminogens were found to be
coplanar in the optimized gas-phase geometry (see Figure S1). The calculated structures were therefore consistent
with those observed by X-ray crystallography. The exceptions were 5 and 6, whose benzofuran and phenyl were
calculated to be coplanar, whereas the crystal data showed them to
be twisted from coplanarity with respect to each other (vide supra).
This notwithstanding, the HOMO and LUMO frontier orbitals were calculated
and they were found to be delocalized entirely across the conjugated
framework of the luminogens. The frontier orbitals, along with the
calculated energy gap of 1, 2, and 7, are illustrated in Figure 6. The effect of the nitrile on the HOMO and LUMO energy
levels is also evident in the figure. Notably, the nitrile substitution
lowers both the LUMO energy level by 0.64 eV and the HOMO energy level
by 0.35 eV, compared to its unsubstituted vinyl counterpart. The overall
effect of lowering the two energy energies reduces the HOMO–LUMO
energy gap, being 0.28 eV smaller for 2 relative to 1. A similar trend in energy gap reduction was found when
adding the furan. In this case, the additional heterocycle extends
the degree of conjugation and lowers the energy gap by ca. 0.3 eV.
The effect of extending the conjugated chain with furan mainly destabilizes
the HOMO level by 0.24 eV for 7 compared to 2. The perturbation effect of the nitrile group on the HOMO and LUMO
energy levels was experimentally confirmed from the oxidation and
reduction potentials by cyclic voltammetry (see Table S3 and Figure S2 for the cyclic voltammograms of 1, 2 and 7).

orbitals along with their corresponding
energy levels calculated gas-phase by DFT.

Solution Spectroscopic Properties
In light of the solid-state
intermolecular contacts that were expected to affect the luminogen
emission, the spectroscopic properties of 1–7 were evaluated. Their absorption and fluorescence were first
evaluated in dilute (10–5 M) chloroform (Figures 7 and 8). These conditions were chosen to benchmark the properties
and to ensure the absence of any supramolecular contacts and aggregates.
The dilute conditions further ensured that the intrinsic emission
properties of the luminogens were evaluated without any bimolecular
effects. The latter would otherwise lead to lower than expected emission
yields. Chloroform proved the best solvent for solubilizing 1–7. Moreover, its aproticity ensured
that no solute–solvent hydrogen bonds occurred. These would
otherwise lead to spectral shifts and potentially inaccurate emission
yields.

Figure 7 Normalized absorption (dashed line) and emission (solid line) spectra
at 10–5 M in chloroform (black line) and normalized
solid-state emission spectra (blue line) of 1 (a), 3(b), and 5(c).

Figure 8 Normalized absorption (dashed line) and emission (solid line) spectra
at 10–5 M in chloroform (black line) and normalized
solid-state emission spectra (blue line) of 2 (a), 4(b), 6 (c), and 7(d).

A well-defined vibronic structure was observed
for the absorption
spectrum of 1 (Figure 7a) along with two maxima (374 and 355 nm) and a shoulder
at 338 nm. Similarly, the emission spectrum was also well structured
with a maximum at 374 nm and a shoulder at 396 nm. In fact, 3 and 5 exhibited structured absorption and emission
(Figure 7b,c). It is
worthy to note that a moderate Stokes shift of ca. 3300 cm–1 was observed for all the luminogens (Table 1). This is consistent with the excited state
being moderately stabilized by the solvent. This is in part due to
a rigid system having little rotation around the benzofuran–vinyl
bond. This locked configuration limits polarization in the excited
state.

Similar to what was observed with the crystallographic data, modifying
the luminogen structure affected both the absorption and emission
spectra. For example, replacing the benzofuran with a phenyl,
as in 3, blue-shifted the absorption and emission maxima.
However, this substitution preserved both the fine vibronic structure
and the small Stokes shift. In contrast, the absorption and emission
maxima were red-shifted when adding a furan to the luminogens, such
as for 5. This substitution did not increase the Stokes
shift. This implies that 5 remained rigid, similar to
the other investigated luminogens. This is consistent with previously
investigated oligofurans where the overall rigidity was not perturbed
with the increasing degree of conjugation.6 This is apparent from the measured fluorescence quantum yields (Φfl) of the luminogens. The measured absolute emission yields
for both 1 and 5 in chloroform and methanol
were greater than 70% (Table 1). Replacing a furan in the conjugated framework with a phenyl,
as in 3, decreased the Φfl to 50%. The
emission is nonetheless significantly more intense than its all phenyl
counterpart, trans-stilbene (Φfl = 5% in hexane).17

From the emission
yield, it is apparent that the benzofuran
reduces the intrinsic fluorescence deactivating pathways by photoisomerization
and ISC. These quenching manifolds are typically extremely efficient
in stilbenes.18 In fact, it is worthy to
note that no photoisomers were spectroscopically detectable either
in solution and the crystalline state. Modifying the luminogen structure
was also found to impact the excited lifetime (τ) when measured
in solution. Common to the three vinylene derivatives was their mono-exponential
fluorescence kinetics. The fluorescence lifetime increased by ca.
20%, when replacing the benzofuran with a phenyl (1 vs 3). Similarly, the lifetime increased by nearly
2-fold with an additional furan (5 vs 1).
The fluorescence rate constants (kf),
calculated according to τ/Φfl, decreased when
progressing along the series from 1 to 3 and to 5. The respective calculated kf values were 8.3-, 5.8-, and 4.9 × 108 s–1 (Table 1). These are comparable to the known kf for stilbene (5.9 × 108 s–1).17 Meanwhile, the nonradiative rate
constants (knr) were ca. 2.5-, 1.2-, and
3.4-fold slower than the corresponding kf values for 1, 3, and 5, respectively.
Non emissive deactivation modes nonetheless account for >20% of
the
excited-state deactivation pathways, according to 1 – Φfl. The excited-state kinetics demonstrate that slight structural
modification affects the excited lifetime. They also confirm that
nonradiative deactivation, although present to a lesser degree than
emission, is a slower mode of quenching. Meanwhile, the mono-exponential
decay suggests that the emission is from only one species. This precludes
photoisomerization and rotamer formation, as these photoproducts would
also emit. This is consistent with a structurally similar derivative
of 3, 2,3-distyryl benzofuran, that exhibited very
low photoisomerization efficiency (ca. 3%).19

The effect of adding the nitrile to the vinylene is apparent
when
comparing the structurally similar series 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, and 5 vs 6. Appending the nitrile to the unsaturated bond resulted
in the loss of the vibronic structure in both the absorption and emission
spectra of 2, 4, and 6, relative
to their unsubstituted vinylene counterparts. This was also accompanied
by a broadening of the absorption and a red shift, relative to the
corresponding unsubstituted vinylene counterparts. Moreover, the emission
spectra of the cyanovinylene derivatives were consistently red-shifted
by ca. 40 nm relative to their counterparts for the three sets of
luminogens studied. This is a result of the greater dipole inducing
effect of the electronic withdrawing nitrile that enhances an intramolecular
electronic push–pull with
the electron rich benzofuran in the excited state. The resulting
polarized state is stabilized more in the polar solvent used for the
measurements than its unsubstituted vinylene counterparts, giving
rise to the red-shift. Substituting the ethylene with the nitrile
also impacted the emission yields. The Φfl of 2, 4, and 6 was essentially quenched
(<2%) compared to their unsubstituted vinylene counterparts. This
was expected as the nitrile of cyanostilbene derivatives is well known
to enhance the rotational disorder of its aromatic neighbors.20 This nonradiative deactivation mode is efficient
in solution, resulting in suppressed emission.21

Solid-State Emission
To evaluate
the cyanovinylene
mediated solid-state emission enhancement, the emission of the unsubstituted
vinylene counterparts was first examined in the solid state. These
were examined to benchmark the solid-state emission properties. Substantial
fluorescence quenching in the solid state would be expected with classical
aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) emission if this mode of excited-state
deactivation was prevalent. The solid-state emission 1, 3, and 5 was red-shifted and less structured
than when measured in solution. The perceived color emitted from 1 and 3 was blue, occurring at 437 and 427 nm,
respectively. This was also accompanied by a weakly detectable green
emission that was observed at 497 nm. The solid-state Φfl of 3 was consistent with its emission yield
in solution. In contrast, the solid-state emission of 1 was 25% lower, compared to when measured in solution. It nonetheless
fluoresced appreciably (Φfl = 55%) in the solid state.
The solid-state arrangements adopted by 1 and 3 are in part responsible for their consistently high Φfl both in the solid state and in solution. π-Stacking
modes that are known to contribute to ACQ were not observed in the
X-ray data of 1 and 3. Rather, only lateral
interactions were observed. This crystal arrangement is well-known
not to quench the emission.2b In fact, 3 packs in a criss-cross fashion with two molecules in the
unit cell being orthogonal and edge-on with their phenyls. Correlating
the emission yields with the X-ray data, it is apparent that structurally
modifying the luminogen by incorporating a furan affects the solid-state
packing, which in turn impacts that the quantum yields. It is noteworthy
that the furan is not expected to promote ISC, as the ISC yields are
known to be consistent, regardless of the degree of oligomerization
for oligofurans.9b

The fluorescence
lifetimes of both 1 and 3 were uniquely
mono-exponential, similar to what was observed in solution. A single
species therefore emits in the solid state. This suggests that only
one crystalline supramolecular arrangement is adopted. If other forms
occurred, they were not fluorescent. The fluorescence lifetimes also
increased by more than 2-fold in the solid state. Meanwhile, the knr reduced by 1.5- and 2-fold for 1 and 3, respectively. The longer solid-state lifetime,
and hence a reduced radiative rate, of 1 and 3 further suggests excited-state deactivation by molecular motion.
Hindering this internal quenching pathway via supramolecular means
increases the fluorescence lifetime. In contrast to 1 and 3, the Φfl of their molecularly
extended counterpart 5 decreased significantly (7%) in
the solid state. This fluorescence quenching is most likely due to
partial intermolecular π-stacking that takes place between the
benzofuran and furan. These contacts were found in the single-crystal
X-ray structure.

The cyanovinylenes 2, 4, 6, and 7 emitted more intense
in the solid state
than in solution. This was expected owing to the well-known solid-state-induced
planarization of cyanostyryls, which are reinforced by intermolecular
contacts involving the nitrile nitrogen.22 It should be noted that the solid-state emission yields were measured
with an integrating sphere. Both the direct and indirect scattering
and emission were factored in.23 This approach
takes into account anisotropy effects and both reabsorption and emission
from indirect excitation. Therefore, the measurements should be independent
of the solid-state layer thickness and alignment of the crystals with
respect to the excitation beam. Taking this into account, the fluorescence
enhancement of the cyanovinylenes was found to be contingent
on the molecular structure. For example, the solid-state emission
was more enhanced for the smaller molecules (2 and 4) compared to their more structurally extended counterparts, 6 and 7. The emission of these two cyanovinylenes
increased 12- and 17-fold, respectively, in the solid state. Comparing
the absolute emissions of 2 vs 7 and 4 vs 6, the emission of the structurally extended
derivatives was reduced. This is a result of the additional aryl–aryl
bond that increases the excited-state quenching modes by bond rotation
and vibration. The emission of 6 and 7 was
nonetheless enhanced 15- and 10-fold, respectively, when measured
as a powder and compared to their emission in solution. The weak fluorescence
of the cyanovinylene derivatives in solution precluded their
lifetime measurement. This aside, the solid-state emission enhancement
for the cyanovinylenes can be in part assigned to intermolecular
hydrogen bonds involving the nitrile, when factoring in the crystallographic
data. These interactions rigidify the aggregate and suppress intrinsic
fluorescence deactivation modes that involve molecular organization.
Given the solid-state emission of the cyanovinylenes was far
less than unity, hydrogen bonding of the nitrile is insufficient to
completely suppress the fluorescence deactivation modes. In fact,
the crystallographic data show that 2, 4, 6, and 7 have a propensity to π-stack.
This arrangement is in part responsible for offsetting the full effect
of the hydrogen bond mediated emission enhancement.

The emission
wavelength was contingent on the luminogen structure.
For example, the perceived color emitted from 4 was green
with a broad emission centered at 490 nm. The emissions of 2 and 6 were perceived both as yellow, with their maximum
at 547 and 530 nm, respectively. Meanwhile, the observed color emitted
from 7 was orange with a maximum at 597 nm. The emission
of 2 was red-shifted by 119 nm compared to counterpart 1. In the crystal packing, 2 adopted parallel
and planar sheets that were connected via hydrogen bonds between the
nitrile nitrogen and the vinylic hydrogen. The heteroatoms were found
to be parallel and aligned along a common axis. This parallel configuration
is assumed to lead to a large dipole moment, which contributes to
the observed extended red shift. In contrast, 1 adopted
a herringbone-like crystal packing. In this configuration, the molecules
are offset and any collective dipole moment is canceled. The solid-state
emission of both 3 and 7 was similarly red-shifted
by ca. 60 nm compared to when measured in solution. The exception
was 6, whose solid-state emission was shifted by only
20 nm relative to solution. The latter aside, the shifts indicate
that the excited state of the luminogens is more stabilized in the
crystal state than in solution. This is a result of the various intermolecular
interactions that occur in the crystal packing. The excited states
of both 3 and 4 were similarly stabilized,
based on the minimal emission difference between them (7 nm). In contrast,
the solid-state emission of 6 was red-shifted by 35 nm
compared to 5. The increased stabilization of 6 can in part be ascribed to the overlapping aromatics and π-stacking
in the crystal packing. These arrangements are not prevalent for 5, where the aromatics arrange in a zig-zag arrangement. The
data demonstrate that both solid-state intermolecular contacts and
electronic effects therefore affect the emission.

Unlike their
unsubstituted vinylene counterparts, the emission
lifetimes of the cyanovinylenes were best fitted to multi-exponential
decays. In fact, two lifetimes were measured for 2, 4, and 7 in the solid state. This is consistent
with two emitting species. The faster decay component of 2, 4, and 7 was the major contributor to
the fluorescence kinetics. The shorter lifetime of 2 and 4 was ca. four times longer than the solid-state lifetime
of their vinylene counterparts 1 and 3.
The longer lifetimes of 2, 4, and 7 were ca. 2-fold longer than those of their fast components.
It is worthy to note that crystalline needles of the luminogens were
used for the solid-state emission. Correlating their emission lifetime
with the resolved crystal structures should therefore be possible
for the luminogens. However, accurate correlations are possible only
when the excitation beam irradiates a unique crystal. Given such an
alignment was not possible with for the lifetime measurements, only
loose correlations can be drawn between the measured lifetimes and
the solid-state packing. Nonetheless, the calculated radiative decay
constants of the cyanovinylenes were an order of magnitude smaller
than their unsubstituted vinylene counterparts. This is a result of
the longer excited lifetime of the cyanovinylene derivatives.
With the slow kr of 2, 4, and 7, the non-radiative deactivation modes
are efficient and they can compete with emission. However, the knr values calculated for 2 and 4 from the intensity average lifetimes and quantum yields
for the cyanovinylenes were an order of magnitude smaller than
their counterparts 1 and 3. In fact, the kf/knr ratio in the
solid state for 2, 6, and 7 was calculated to be 3, 5.5, and 9 respectively, whereas the ratio
was ca. 1 for the other luminogens. This further demonstrates that
the cyano group suppresses nonradiative modes in the solid state.

Given that the emission of AIE active luminogens can be enhanced
when they aggregate, this effect was examined for 2 in
varying water/methanol mixtures. Although the emission measurements
were done in chloroform, methanol was chosen because of its high degree
of miscibility with water. This is important for ensuring a homogeneous
solution even at high water/methanol ratios that are often required
for aggregating luminogens. The emission of 2 was first
examined in neat methanol to benchmark any emission enhancement. Similar
to what was observed in chloroform, 2 only weakly emitted
in methanol (Φfl = 2%). Its emission intensity increased
with increasing water fractions in methanol/water mixtures (Figure 9). In fact, the most
intense emission was observed with 80 and 90 vol% water; Φfl = 10 and 13%, respectively. The AIE effect of 2 in methanol/water is both qualitatively and quantitatively evident
in Figure 9. The emission
of the aggregate of 2 in methanol/water was red-shifted
compared to the emission in homogeneous solution. The perceived color
of the red-shifted emission was green with a maximum at 540 nm. The
ca. 90 nm emission bathochromic shift was consistent with what was
observed in the solid state. The large red shift implies a high degree
of stabilization of the excited state upon aggregation. This is in
part due to a high degree of intermolecular stacking. While the emission
can be enhanced with aggregation, it can be increased 2-fold further
in the solid state. The additional emission enhancement in the solid
demonstrates the advantage of suppressing excited-state deactivation
processes by molecular motion. These are possible by engaging intermolecular
contacts, especially those that prevent π-stacking modes. The
latter are also efficient emission quenching pathways.

Conclusion
The emission and crystallographic studies
of a series benzofuran
cynano-vinylenes and unsubstituted vinylenes derivatives were investigated.
These were to provide insight into the structural effects on the emission
yields and kinetics. Based on these findings, key information about
the structural requirements for fluorescence enhancement can be derived.
(i) The benzofuran-vinylene framework is required for high emission
in both solution and the solid state. (ii) The terminal aromatic (phenyl
vs benzofuran) does not perturb the emission in either state.
(iii) While incorporating a furan into the luminogen framework does
not affect the quantum yield in solution, it quenches the solid-state
emission by an order of magnitude. This is in part owing to the crystal
packing modes. (iv) In contrast, intermolecular hydrogen bonding in
the solid involving the nitrogen of the cyanovinylene derivatives
enhances the solid-state emission by an order of magnitude relative
to when measured in solution. The solid-state emission of the cyanovinylenes
is nonetheless less than its unsubstituted vinylene counterparts.
While it is possible to modulate the solid-state emission by supramolecular
interactions, additional intermolecular contacts are required to fully
enhance the solid-state emission of benzofuran cyanovinylenes.
Extending the cyano mediated hydrogen bonding to include additional
supramolecular contacts could potentially offset the solid-state emission
deactivation of furans and result in highly emitting furan vinylenes.

Experimental
Section
General Experimental Methods
Unless otherwise stated,
all the reactions were carried out under argon atmosphere with commercially
available reagents and solvents. Anhydrous THF was obtained by distilling
over sodium and benzophenone. The other reagent grade solvents were
used without further purification. Melting points were obtained on
a Start SMP melting point apparatus and they are uncorrected. Mass
spectrometric (MS) measurements were recorded on a MALDI-TOF Bruker
Biflex III instrument using a positive-ion mode. NMR spectra were
recorded at 298 K on a NMR Bruker Avance III 300 spectrometer. Chemical
shifts for 13C NMR spectra were recorded in parts per million
using either the central peak of deuterated chloroform (77.23 ppm)
or deuterated DMSO (39.51 ppm) as the internal standards. Proton NMR
spectra were recorded in parts per million and they were referenced
to the residual solvent proton according to the literature. Characteristic
splitting patterns due to spin–spin coupling are expressed
as follows: br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q =
quartet, p = pentet, m = multiplet.

Benzofuran-2-carbaldehyde
(8), diethyl benzylphosphonate (14), benzofuran-2-ylboronic
acid (10), 5-bromofuran-2-carbaldehyde (11), benzofuran-2(3H)-one (15), and 2-phenylacetonitrile
(13) were purchased from either Aldrich or Jansen and
they were used as received.

Spectroscopy
The emission spectra
were recorded on
a combined steady-state/time-resolved spectrometer with a double excitation
and emission monochromator. Samples for solution analyses were prepared
with an absorbance <0.05 at the corresponding excitation. The solutions
were purged with nitrogen for at least 20 min to remove the dissolved
oxygen. They were then sealed with a screw top with a Teflon-coated
septum. The absolute quantum yields were measured with an integrating
sphere. The absorptions of the solution samples were referenced against
the scattering peak of the solvent at the corresponding excitation
wavelength. The measurements were done with a minimum dwell time/wavelength
of 1 s, measured at 1 nm intervals, and averaged over three scans.
For the solid-state absolute quantum yields, crystals of the given
compound were deposited on a rectangular quartz slide and caution
was taken to neither compress nor disrupt the crystalline structure.
The excitation beam was focused on the sample and the sample was irradiated
with the entire beam. The sample emission from indirect light absorption
in the sphere was factored into the absolute quantum yield calculation
according to known means.23 The excitation
wavelength used for solution and solid-state emissions of 1–7 were respectively 350/350, 380/420, 320/340,
330/350, 380/400, 350/380, and 440/440 nm.

Excited-state lifetimes
were calculated by single-photon time-correlated spectroscopy using
a multi-channel plate time-resolved detector and exciting with a ps-laser
diode. The instrument response frequency was determined by scattering
the ps-laser diode excitation beam with a solid Teflon prism. The
solid-state lifetimes were acquired with a thin film of the sample
spread over a quartz slide. The slide was positioned at 45° to
the excitation beam and the emission detector. The lifetimes were
obtained by fitting either for a mono- or bifunctional decay function,
whichever gave the best correlation of χ2 < 1.4.
