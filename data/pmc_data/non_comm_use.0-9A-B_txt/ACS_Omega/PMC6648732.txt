Polymerization reactions have caused
a number of serious incidents
in the past; they are prone to reaction runaways because of their
exothermic and autoaccelerating nature. To minimalize the risk, the
reaction is commonly performed in a solvent as empirical industrial
practice. In this work, the thermal runaway hazards of the ethylbenzene–styrene
system with different monomer mass fractions were calorimetrically
investigated up to temperatures where decomposition products are unlikely
to be produced. Experiments showed that the polymerization runaway
“onset” temperature inversely increased with the monomer
mass fraction. Experiment and thermodynamic calculations showed that
volatile diluent increased system vapor pressure even at a lower adiabatic
temperature rise and verified that moderation of the risks could be
achieved if the monomer mass fraction is below ca. 85%. A lumped kinetic
model developed by Hui and Hamielec was used to predict the runaway
profile of this reaction under different dilutions, and the agreement
was excellent.

1 Introduction
Styrene is one of the
most widely used monomers and has a variety
of applications in the chemical industry to produce polystyrene, acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
rubber, and many other polymers. However, the storage and polymerization
processes are prone to runaways as monomers are thermally unstable.
Barton and Nolan1 reported that 48% of
total runaway incidents that occurred over the period from 1962 to
1987 in the UK were polymerization reactions. A reactive chemical
incidents report published by the Chemical Safety Board (CSB)2 also denoted that almost 15% of incidents involving
uncontrolled chemical reactions in 1980–2001 in the US are
polymerization thermal runaways. An incident statistical study by
Sales3 in 2006 showed that 17 out of 132
(13%) reactive chemical incidents recorded by the major accident reporting
system in the European Commission were caused by the polymerization
runaway reactions. More recently, Mihailidou4 analyzed 319 major industrial incidents with significant consequences
based on the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) criterion and
found 34 out of 319 (11%) major incidents worldwide during the years
1917–2011 were related to the reactive monomer/polymer process.
Saada5 analyzed 30 runaway incidents in
a specific unit process during 1988–2013 and showed that over
33% of those were polymerization incidents. A significant number of
these incidents were related to styrene production and handling as
listed in Table 1.2,6−9 Despite this, lessons have not been learned, and the reoccurrence
of styrene-related runaway incidents continues.

Several factors contribute to the highly hazardous
styrene handling
and polystyrene production process. First of all, the styrene polymerization
reaction is relatively highly exothermic with a heat generation at
around 71 kJ·mol–1.10 At the same time, even without an initiator, two styrene molecules
will undergo a Diels–Alder type of reaction and generate radicals
to start self-polymerization upon heating.11 This polymerization process auto-accelerates as the reaction progresses;
the system viscosity dramatically increases, and the reaction becomes
diffusion-controlled, which is known as the gel effect or Trommsdorff–Norrish
effect. Figure 1 gives
a schematic of how the gel effect might lead to the thermal runaway
for polymerization.

Figure 1 Gel effect in the polymerization system.

From a classic first-principle kinetic analysis,
the polymerization
rate Rp is proportional related to the
propagation rate constant kp, monomer
concentration, and also to the square root of the initiator efficiency f, the initiator decomposition rate constant kd, and the reciprocal of the termination rate constant kt. As the monomers are consumed, the polymer
concentration as well as polymer molecular weight M increases, and the latter can increase by orders of magnitudes compared
with monomer molar weight. These long-chain polymers significantly
elevate system viscosity via two different mechanisms. First of all,
the intrinsic viscosity of polymer chains [η] increases exponentially
with molecular weight M because of the increase of
the length of polymer chains, which can be described by the Mark–Houwink
as eq 6. Parameters a and K depend on the specific polymer–solvent
system. At the same time, bulk viscosity of the solution increases
with polymer concentration, as formulated by Huggins in eq 7, where ηsp is
the specific viscosity, η0 is the solvent viscosity,
and kH is the Huggins coefficient. Thus,
the mobility of polymer chains and diffusion is strongly hindered
such that the termination rate dramatically drops compared with the
initial termination rate constant kt0 according to eq 8,12 resulting
in a fasterned polymerization reaction rate. This synergetic process
could be further intensified under adiabatic conditions, as reaction
heat generated during exotherm elevates the system temperature and
reaction rate. To ease the gel effect and avoid sudden increase of
viscosity and heat release, the industry employs a small portion of
the organic solvent to reduce the system viscosity and enhance the
mobility of polymer chains.10 A cascade
of tower-type reactors is also employed to limit the reaction extent
and viscosity increase.

It is of great importance that such
a highly hazardous reaction
process should be carried out in compliance with the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119, process safety
management (PSM) of highly hazardous chemicals standard.13 Among the 14 elements included in the PSM, process
hazard analysis is essential in terms of identifying, evaluating,
and controlling the hazard of the process. For reactive chemical systems
in general, calorimeter studies provide valuable process safety data
such as “onset” temperature of exothermic reactions,
maximum temperature, maximum pressure, and noncondensable gas generation
under intended or unintended (mal-operation) conditions.14 These data would serve as the basis for designing
the process itself, its protection layers, and methods to control
reaction hazards, for example, cooling capacity design and relief
valve sizing.

A considerable amount of the literature has been
published on the
assessment of the thermal hazards of the undesirable thermally initiated
styrene polymerization using calorimeters. Whiting and Tou15 evaluated the thermal behavior of inhibited
styrene in an accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) to address the effects
of the system thermal inertia. Gibson et al.16 tested the runaway reaction of inhibited styrene starting from 150
°C in an adiabatic Dewar and calculated the relief valve size.
Frurip et al.17 discussed some general
practices regarding hazard evaluation of polymerizable compounds and
performed the ARC test on uninhibited styrene with peroxide at various
concentrations. Chen et al. performed isothermal studies on inhibited6 and uninhibited18 styrene
to investigate the runaway behavior and kinetic parameters of styrene
at low temperatures using microcalorimeters. Leung et al.19 utilized the ARC to investigate the thermally
initiated polymerization of inhibited styrene with 20% ethylbenzene
added to the system.

A thorough literature review revealed that
very few studies focused
on the diluted styrene-solution system, which is more commonly employed
in industrial practices, and the reaction hazards accruing from this
system were not fully understood. From the inherent safer design (ISD)
point of view,20 the addition of solvent
into the system is an effective “moderating” strategy
because it lowers system viscosity and the reaction runaway severity
as can be shown in Figure 1. At the same time, this moderating measure contradicts the
“substituting” and “simplifying” principles
of ISD by introducing an additional volatile and highly flammable
species into the system. The system complexity also increases as one
more component is involved, inevitably affecting the physical properties
of the system and in particular the ones which are directly related
with its safety (e.g., flash point, flammable limit, heat capacity,
vapor pressure, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity). Furthermore,
additional hazardous scenarios have to be introduced as the interaction
between the solvent and styrene needs to be considered.

For
a pure styrene calorimetry study, the most well-studied scenario
was the worst-case runaway reaction, where the system cooling was
lost and the reaction developed under adiabatic condition. For a binary
solvent-styrene system, another possible scenario is that the solvent-to-monomer
ratio deviates from the original design intent. By applying the hazard
and operability study concept to this solvent-styrene system, the
reaction recipe is chosen as the study node, with monomer mass fraction
as the process parameter, and the deviations (guide words) are “high”
and “low”, which adequately represent two types of mischarging
scenarios. The quantification of the consequences of these scenarios
provides useful information on how monomer fraction will affect runaway
behavior and process hazards.

In this paper, the runaway hazards
of the polymerization of uninhibited
styrene in ethylbenzene were evaluated as a function of the monomer
mass fraction in screening and adiabatic calorimeters to obtain quantitative
reaction hazard information. A lumped kinetic modeling was employed
to simulate the temperature and pressure profile, and the global rate
of the thermal polymerization was evaluated to obtain critical reaction
parameters for predicting runaway behavior.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
Ethylbenzene (Sigma-Aldrich,
ReagentPlus, 99%) and alumina inhibitor remover (Sigma-Aldrich) were
used without further purification. Styrene (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus,
99%) contained 15 ppm of 4-tert-butylcatechol (TBC)
as an inhibitor; this inhibitor requires dissolved oxygen to become
effective. To rule out the retardant effect of inhibitor, TBC was
removed before testing. Alumina has been identified as an active adsorption
material of TBC for industry practices.21 By passing the styrene slowly through a packed column with alumina
inhibitor remover, the inhibitor-free monomer was obtained and used
immediately. Purified styrene monomer was mixed with ethylbenzene
to prepare a series of solutions with a monomer mass fraction that
varied from 0.55 to 1.

2.2 Differential Scanning Calorimeter
Dynamic scanning tests with a small sample size were conducted
in
a Q20 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA Instruments) to get
preliminary results of styrene thermal behavior. Approximately 5 mg
of test samples were heated from 30 to 300 °C at a fixed heating
rate of 4 K·min–1. To prevent sample boiling,
high-pressure (15 MPa) stainless steel capsules were used for all
tests. The measured heat flow was divided by the mass of the reactant
to obtain the specific heat flow; then, the specific heat flow was
integrated with respect to test time to get the specific heat of the
sample. The specific heat of reaction of styrene monomer for styrene–ethylbenzene
samples was calculated by dividing the heat of reaction of the entire
sample by the mass fraction of styrene. The baselines for integration
were obtained by rescanning the sample after each test.

2.3 Automatic Pressure Tracking Adiabatic Calorimeter
A
DSC study only gives heat generation information for small sample
quantities. The obtained data are not enough to adequately assess
the thermal hazards of reaction at industrial scales under worst-case
scenarios; only to flag severe thermal hazards. Furthermore, it is
also not possible to obtain pressure-rise information during the runaway
with DSC. In a thermal runaway incident, it is the pressure which
rises, as the temperature increases, driving to potential rupture
of the confined container or its explosion, loss of containment and
potential domino effects such as fire. Adiabatic calorimeter tests
have been proven to be extremely important for a more reliable evaluation
of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals in bulk quantities under
various conditions. The automatic pressure tracking adiabatic calorimeter
(APTAC) enables the use of a relatively large sample size and maintains
the reactant at near adiabatic conditions by keeping the temperature/pressure
difference in and out of the test cell minimal.

In this work,
ca. 10 g of the sample was loaded into a glass test-cell of a thermal
inertia factor (φ-factor) of 1.25–1.26. To eliminate
the dissolved oxygen, the sample was purged with nitrogen for 30 min
in an ice bath before being tested. Styrene polymerization generates
only condensable gases and has been identified as a vapor system by
the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) regarding relief valve
design.22 To suppress the boiling of the
solution and minimalize the tempering effects, the APTAC cell, together
with the contained reactant, was pressurized with nitrogen to around
1000 kPa (147 psi) before heating. A heat–wait–search
operating mode23 was applied with temperature
steps of 5 °C, a heating rate of 5 °C·min–1, and a 30 min waiting period between temperature steps. APTAC entered
adiabatic mode once the self-heating rate exceeded 0.1 °C·min–1. Temperature and pressure, as well as the rate of
self-heating and pressure-rise, was measured and recorded throughout
the experiment.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 DSC Test of Inhibited and Purified Styrene
Inhibited
and inhibitor-free styrene was first tested in DSC to
check the effect of TBC on styrene thermally initiated self-polymerization
reaction. The specific heat flow is shown in Figure 2, and the characteristic thermal hazards
information obtained from repeated trails are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen in Figure 2, three exothermic
peaks were displayed in both cases. However, the time of their appearance
and the heat flow generated are significantly different. For TBC inhibited
styrene, the first exothermic peak was detected to be around 150 °C,
followed by a higher peak at 205 °C and an almost invisible one
at around 250 °C. This multipeak exothermic curve denoted a complex
reaction pathway of thermal polymerization of styrene and had been
observed in many other studies.15,18 Liao7 reported similar peak behavior for TBC inhibited styrene
and performed kinetic modeling on each peak. It was identified that
the first peak was typical of an autocatalytic behavior while the
second peak was an nth order regarding styrene with
a reaction order around 1.8–2. For inhibitor-free samples,
the DSC curve showed a different thermal profile as three major exothermic
peaks appeared at 120, 150, and 205 °C. As can be seen, the overall
heat generation was approximately the same for both cases. However,
in the case of the uninhibited monomer, the reaction became notable
at a much lower temperature (101 °C) while its rate of heat generation
was much slower than that of the inhibited monomer. Also, the temperature
range of the exothermic reaction was expanded. It is argued that thermally
initiated radicals trigger the polymerization at a much lower temperature,
which can be considered as a guiding value for deciding on styrene
storage conditions in view of inhibitor depletion. When the TBC or
other inhibitors are exhausted over time in a styrene tank, the self-reaction
may significantly accelerate at around 101 °C. On the other hand,
if unwanted polymerization occurs in an inhibited quantity of styrene,
containment of the unwanted reaction may not be possible as the generation
of heat will be more intense after 150 °C compared with uninhibited
styrene. The maximum heat flow for either sample was detected at 205
°C, and this unaltered characteristic temperature indicated that
15 ppm of TBC effectively inhibited self-polymerization but only at
the early stage. It is plausible that the first peak denotes the primary
radical production, where the TBC acts as a radical scavenger and
thus delays the polymerization until it is depleted at a higher temperature.
The main peak is likely to represent the main polymerization process
in the course of which the monomers add up to build the extended polymer
chain. The heat of polymerization of styrene obtained from this study
was between 629–646 J·g–1, which is
slightly lower than the value of 670 ± 11 J·g–1 measured by Chen18 using 10 mg of styrene.
This deviation may be owed to the more heat dissipation to the surrounding
caused by the smaller sample size in this study.

3.2 DSC Study of the Mass Fraction Effect
To study the impact of the monomer mass fraction on self-polymerization,
dynamic DSC tests of purified styrene–ethylbenzene solutions
with different solvent additions were performed, and the results are
summarized in Table 3. As can be seen from the table, the “onset” temperature
(Ton) obtained from DSC test was observed
at around 100 °C and did not shift upon ethylbenzene addition.
Similarly, the maximum exothermic peak temperature (Tpeak) appeared at approximately 205–210 °C
and it was marginally if not at all, affected by the mass of styrene.
The normalized heat, however, was substantially affected by the mass
fraction of styrene in the solution.

The specific heat flow profiles of the samples are shown in Figure 3a. The total heat
of reaction was calculated as described in the experimental section
and summarized in Table 3 as ΔH of the solution. The heat of reaction
of the samples was the total heat released by the samples. This value
is useful for the calculation of the cooling system for the polymerization.
The monotonically decreasing heat release indicated that addition
of the solvent significantly reduced the overall thermal hazards.
The heat flow was then divided by the styrene mass fraction to produce Figure 3b, and the overall
reaction heat of styrene is reported as ΔH of
styrene in Table 3.
Three major exothermic peaks for all polymerization reactions irrespectively
of styrene concentrations were obtained. As can be seen in Figure 3b, in all cases,
the first two peaks had approximately the same position and area.
In other words, the same amount of heat was produced by styrene, regardless
of ethylbenzene addition up to around 150 °C. This observation
led to the hypothesis that the thermally initiated polymerization
process of styrene was not affected by the addition of solvent at
the initial stage (before around 150 °C). The last exothermic
peak shifted from 205 to 210 °C as styrene mass fraction in the
solution was reduced from 100 to 55%. In addition to that, the respective
peak became wider as the solvent increased; the severity of the reaction
step was decreased as the specific heat released in each case was
declining (smaller peak area) with a lower monomer mass fraction.
This is a clear indication that the final peak corresponds to chain-addition/termination
course, a process which has been known to be strongly affected by
the gel effect.

(− −), 70% styrene (- - - -), 55% styrene (- ·
-). (a) Specific heat flow per gram of solution (b) specific heat
flow per gram of styrene.

The DSC results denoted the decline of the overall reaction
heat
resulted from the reduced severity of the main exothermic step, as
shown in Figure 3b.
When the mass fraction of styrene in the test sample was lowered,
the collisions between active reactant species were significantly
reduced, resulting in a slower chain addition process. At the same
time, in the more diluted solution, the mobility of the polymer chains
was increased which facilitated the termination process, thus resulting
in reduced chain length and therefore reduced reaction severity. Therefore,
the DSC results confirmed that when the reaction takes place in a
dilute solution, it becomes significantly less thermally hazardous
because of the reduced heat generated. However, as this is partially
owed to the shorter polymer chains production, product quality standards
also need to be considered so that the objective of performing the
polymerization is not compromised.

3.3 APTAC
Study of the Mass Fraction Effect
The runaway behavior of
similar bulk samples was also characterized
under adiabatic conditions employing one of the best instruments serving
such studies. A larger sample size was used in which case the heat
and mass transfer effects became more significant, which adequately
mimicked the real reaction vessels. The results of the respective
measurements are summarized in Table 4. The corresponding temperature and pressure trajectories
are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The
first column of Table 4 represents the “onset” temperature (Ton) of the adiabatic reaction, which is taken as the temperature
when the self-heating rate of the reaction exceeds 0.1 °C·min–1, and the APTAC enters the adiabatic mode from the
heat–wait–search mode. The apparent adiabatic temperature
rise was calculated as the difference between the maximum temperature
at the end of the exothermic process and the “onset”
temperature Ton. This number was multiplied
by the φ factor to obtain the true adiabatic temperature rise
(ΔTad) as shown in the second column.
The time-to-maximum rate (TMR) is the time needed for the runaway
reaction to reach its maximum self-heating rate. The maximum pressure
increase (ΔP) was calculated by subtracting
the initial value of the adiabatic pressure from the peak pressure.
The last two columns of Table 4 display the maximum pressure-rise rate (dP/dtm) and maximum self-heating rate (dT/dtm) during the adiabatic
reaction. The data during the heat–wait–search period
were omitted in Figures 4 and 5, and the time in these two figures
was normalized by setting the “onset” time at 0 min.

For pure styrene system,
the detected adiabatic “onset”
temperature was 106 °C, denoting that the polymerization reaction
started to have a self-heating rate higher than 0.1 °C·min–1. Soon after the “onset”, a steep increase
in temperature was observed starting at 100 min of the reaction, resulting
in a temperature increment of 200 °C within 15 min. Such rapid,
explosive-like reaction behavior indicates the severity of uncontrolled
thermal polymerization of pure styrene. Correspondingly, the pressure
inside the test cell increased by 1300 kPa (189 psi), indicating how
severe threat to process vessels and relief valves a runaway can pose.
These data also explain why it is a common practice in the industry
to avoid using 100% pure styrene for polymer production. The maximum
temperature obtained was about 20 °C below the decomposition
“onset” temperature of polystyrene in nitrogen as obtained
by Peterson,24 indicating that no decomposition
was initiated by the runaway reaction.

From the temperature
data, it is clear that as the monomer mass
fraction decreased, heat generated by the reaction dissipated to the
solvent, and a significant delay and mitigation of thermal polymerization
was observed. The adiabatic “onset” temperature increased
to 126 °C for 55% styrene. This is a clear indication that the
solvent will “delay” a potential runaway such that the
same self-heating rate was achieved at a much higher temperature for
diluted samples. However, at the same time, from a scientific point
of view, this research demonstrates the misleading role that the “onset”
temperature can play if it is considered as a “physical property”
of the reactant. What actually these measurements indicate is that
the enhanced transfer of heat of reaction because of the dilution
of the monomer substantially delays the reaction runaway.

Additionally,
the adiabatic temperature rise dropped from 290 to
104 °C, which was almost 1/3 of the value for pure styrene when
the mass fraction was reduced to 55%. Unsurprisingly, the time for
the reaction to reach its summit increased as the styrene mass fraction
dropped. For all samples, the main exothermic activity was observed
after 100 min. For pure styrene, it took only 121 min for the adiabatic
reaction to reach its maximum speed. As the mass content dropped,
a longer time was required for the polymerization to develop fully,
and the TMR prolonged. The 55% styrene–ethylbenzene system
took almost 3 h to reach its maximum heat release rate. It is clear
that the pure styrene system brings difficulties to hazard mitigation
or emergency responding, and adding solvents is a practical solution
to mitigate the sudden temperature increase. In the case of a loss-of-cooling
scenario, systems with longer TMR have a lower risk of catastrophic
consequences as more time is available to respond and implement mitigation
measures.

However, the effect of styrene concentration on pressure
change
was not as straightforward as temperature. All experiments had approximately
the same initial pad pressure of 1000 kPa (147 psi) but their “onset”
temperatures were different, leading to a slight variation on the
“onset” pressure. The peak pressure and pressure difference
did not change monotonically with the mass content. When styrene was
diluted from 100 to 85%, a higher pressure building up was observed.
The pressure changes then declined upon further ethylbenzene addition.
As there was no noncondensable gas production during this reaction,
the pressure increases primarily consisted of two parts: (1) the vapor
pressure of volatile components, which is also a function of temperature
and (2) the expansion of pad gas at higher temperature practically
obeying the gas law. For the polymer mixture system, the former one
was also affected by the polymers produced. According to Flory’s
free volume theory,25 the vapor pressure
of polymer itself is usually omitted, but the polymer chains had significant
effects on the activity of solvent and monomer, leading to a change
of vapor pressure of these volatile species. In this study, a pure
styrene system had the highest temperature increase, leading to a
higher expansion of nitrogen pad. At the same time, as no solvent
was present, monomers reacted to form a nonvolatile polymer, which
contributed very little to the total pressure. The pressure trajectory
denoted that the system pressure reached its maximum before the end
of the adiabatic reaction, and gradually decreased afterward. Similar
pressure behavior was also observed by Gibson16 in Dewar bottle and Tou15 in the ARC,
where the maximum pressure during the runaway reaction of styrene
was significantly higher than the final pressure. The experimental
data reinforced the speculation that monomer vapor pressure contribution
first increases and then decreases during the reaction.

For
the 85% styrene–ethylbenzene system, the lower temperature
increment resulted in a less-expanded nitrogen pad. However, the ethylbenzene
was not consumed during the reaction and then contributed to building
up vapor pressure. The summation of these two factors led to an overall
higher pressure (2400 kPa) than the pure system (2200 kPa). It is
worth mentioning that this higher pressure was observed at a lower
temperature (298 °C) compared with that of the pure styrene (335
°C). If this maximum pressure was normalized to 335 °C,
then the potential pressure rise could increase further to around
2562 kPa, which was also denoted in the figure. As more solvent was
added, the reaction extent and temperature increase were lowered,
even though more solvent vaporized at a lower temperature, and the
expansion of pad gas was not significant, resulting in a lowered total
pressure increase. From a safety perspective, the real hazard of a
runaway reaction is the uncontrolled pressure, as the direct cause
of the loss of containment is the overpressure. Toxic or flammable
reactants may be released when the pressure build up exceeds the ultimate
strength of the process vessel, followed by fire or explosion. Although
diluting the monomer by 15% helps lower heat release, the elevated
pressure change may pose another concern of possible loss of containment.

These key hazard indicators obtained from adiabatic tests were
plotted in Figure 6. The maximum pressure-rising rate (dP/dtm) and the maximum self-heating rate (dT/dtm) during the runaway both
raised exponentially with respect to styrene mass fraction.

3.4 Hui and
Hamielec Kinetic Verification of Adiabatic
Data
To predict the thermal runaway behavior of the styrene–ethylbenzene
system and also obtain the optimum solvent dosage ratio to minimize
both thermal and pressure hazards, kinetic simulation needs to be
carried out. The Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems (DIERS)26 has recommended the use of the Hui and Hamielec27 model to predict the thermal runaway temperature
profile of the thermally initiated styrene polymerization in ethylbenzene
in a bulk quantity (32 L). This model was developed in the 1970s for
the thermally initiated polymerization of styrene taking into consideration
of the gel effect and viscosity change at higher conversions. The
initiation was assumed to be a third-order reaction with respect to
the monomer concentration. Other reaction rate constants were empirically
correlated with the polymer mass fraction and temperature.

The
overall polymerization rate of Hui and Hamielec kinetic model can
be cast as follows 5   6   7   8   9   10  where x is the mass fraction
of styrene in the system; xp is the mass
fraction of polymer; [M] is the monomer molar concentration in mol·L–1; and temperature-related parameters A0, A1, A2, A3 are independent of conversion.
For the styrene/ethylbenzene/polystyrene system in this study, thermodynamic
properties such as density, heat capacity, and pure component vapor
pressure were calculated with empirical correlations.19 The adiabatic temperature profile was simulated for different
runs employing 55–100% monomer in solution for which adiabatic
measurements were performed. The heat loss correction was performed
using the thermal inertia factor obtained in the experimental section.
The comparison of the self-heating rate between experimental results
and the simulated ones employing eqs 5–10 are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Self-heating rate during
adiabatic runaway reaction for different
styrene–ethylbenzene mass fractions: 100% (□), 85% (◯),
70% (△), 55% (▽), and Hui and Hamielec kinetic prediction
(solid lines).

As can be seen from the
figure, the empirical rate equations provided
by Hui and Hamielec are in good agreement with the adiabatic experimental
data in terms of self-heating rate change regarding the reciprocal
of temperature. Figure 8 shows a comparison of a series of simulation results with experimentally
detected maximum temperature and maximum self-heating rates. The model
showed a linear trend of maximum adiabatic temperature increase and
an exponentially increasing peak self-heating rate with the monomer
mass fraction. The model predicted a slightly lowered maximum self-heating
rate for all cases. Adjustment of the value of parameters A0–A3 using
experimental data may result in more accurate predictions of the self-heating
rates and pressures.

results (□). (a) Maximum adiabatic temperature and (b) maximum
temperature rising rate.

The total pressure of the system was also simulated by considering
both pad gas pressure and vapor pressure, as discussed before. The
vapor pressure of volatile components (monomer and ethylbenzene) was
calculated based on the partial vapor pressure of each component over
a monomer/polymer/solvent system via the following Flory–Huggins
equation28 (eq 11) to correct the respective activities. Pi0 is the pure compound vapor pressure; ϕi is the
volume fraction of the compound; ϕp is the volume
fraction of polymer chains; and χ is the polymer–solvent
interaction parameter, which was measured by Flory to be around 0.45
for polystyrene in ethylbenzene.29 11  

The pad-pressure
change of nitrogen was assumed to follow the ideal
gas law, while the gas-phase temperature increased during exotherm,
and the headspace volume expanded because of the contraction of the
liquid phase caused by polymerization. In such a way, each pressure
contributor was simulated separately, as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Hui and Hamielec kinetic
modeling and experiment results of the
maximum pressure change for ethylbenzene–styrene systems.

The simulation results showed
that the maximum pressure during
the adiabatic thermal runaway was not a monotonic function of the
monomer mass fraction, which was confirmed by the experiments. It
was expected that as the reaction temperature increased during the
adiabatic runaway polymerization, the pad gas expansion would result
in a respective rise of pressure. However, as the monomer with lower
density gradually reacted to build up polymer chains with higher density,
a contraction of the liquid phase and an expansion of the gas phase
was introduced. This volume change counterbalanced the temperature
change effect and moderated the pad-pressure increase. The vapor pressure
of monomer and ethylbenzene increased with temperature, while at the
same time the monomer was consumed and thus its contribution to the
total vapor pressure during the reaction decreased.

When the
mass fraction of monomer increased from 55 to 100%, the
nonreactive volatile components fractions dropped, and the total pressure
increase with conversion showed a significant change. Two different
pressure change patterns were observed as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Hui and Hamielec kinetic
modeling of pressure change as a function
of styrene conversion for selected ethylbenzene–styrene systems.

For samples with monomer mass
fraction below 95%, the calculated
maximum pressure was observed at the end of the reaction (Pmax = Pfinal). In
these cases, although the monomer was completely consumed at the final
stage, the solvent vapor pressure reached its maximum and had a significant
contribution to the total pressure. The simulations for a styrene
mass fraction of 95 and 100% showed that the total pressure first
increased with conversion and then dropped at the end of the reaction
(Pmax > Pfinal). In other words, the peak thermal hazard and peak pressure hazard
appeared at different stages of the adiabatic runaway reaction. For
the pure styrene sample, simulation denoted peak pressure value was
at around 77% monomer conversion, at which point 23% of the monomer
still had a significant contribution to the total pressure. After
more monomers were consumed, the simulated vapor pressure of monomer
dropped to 0 psi at the end point (100% conversion). The total pressure
was then equal to the pad gas pressure. The experimental results were
in good agreement with the prediction within the mutual error. The
results showed that the addition of solvent or the lowering of mass
fraction was an effective measure to prolong TMR and moderate the
rate of heat release. However, volatile solvents lead to a higher
pressure rise even at lower temperatures, which introduces a different
kind of hazard which has to be taken into consideration when designing
the vapor relief systems.

The experimental and lumped kinetic
modeling results reported herein
should be considered in the light of some limitations. First of all,
other species which are present in the polymer production such as
initiators, chain-transfer agents, or possible contaminants may also
have an impact on the thermal runaway behavior. Other scenarios and
further studies are necessary to be conducted to evaluate the synergistic
effects which arise from their presence. At the same time, the lumped
kinetic simulation with Hui and Hamielec model matched well with the
adiabatic self-heating rate for the concentrated samples at higher
temperature range while overestimated the rate of polymerization at
the initial stage. This deviation may be caused by the simplified
empirical correlation which was insufficient to provide detailed expressions
of rate constants for individual step in the free-radical polymerization
reaction. A series of more detailed kinetic studies have been carried
out by a working party of the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC) since 198830,31 to obtain the accurate
values of the critical rate constants for a variety of free-radical
polymerization systems. More specifically, for the styrene system,
the pulsed laser polymerization–size exclusion chromatography
(PLP–SEC) method was first used to obtain the benchmark value
of the propagation rate coefficient of styrene.32 The change of initiator efficiency of 2,2′-azoisobutyronitril
in styrene was evaluated under different temperature and pressure
conditions.33 Most importantly, the experimental
method to accurately assess the termination rate coefficient has been
carefully reviewed for various free-radical polymerization systems,34,35 followed by a recent experimental evaluation of the styrene termination
rate coefficient that covers the entire conversion range.36 These benchmark values and IUPAC recommended
PLP–SEC experimental method have facilitated the development
of numerous new kinetic models as summarized by Achilias.12 The future utilization of these detailed nonempirical
kinetic modeling would enable a deeper understanding of styrene polymerization
thermal runaway behavior at bulk quantities.

4 Conclusion
The effect of styrene mass fractions on the thermally
initiated
polymerization runaway hazards of the styrene–ethylbenzene
system was studied using screening and adiabatic calorimeters. DSC
results confirmed a multipeak reaction exotherm between 100 and 300
°C. The addition of diluent effectively reduced overall heat
release by affecting the late stage of the reaction at higher temperatures
(>150 °C). Adiabatic tests identified a delayed and milder
self-polymerization
upon dilution, with higher detected “onset” temperature
and linearly decreased adiabatic temperature rise. Both screening
and adiabatic test results confirmed that the overall heat release
and reaction severity was reduced by the addition of the solvent.
At the same time, the pressure build-up rate and temperature rate
exponentially decreased with lower monomer mass fraction, proving
that dilution with solvent is an effective measure to moderate reaction
thermal hazards and as such it may form a sound inherently safer design
option, especially when the monomer mass fraction drops below 0.8.
However, when the monomer was diluted in ethylbenzene to 85% w/w,
the presence of volatile species resulted in a higher pressure-rise
during reaction runaway compared with the pure styrene system even
at lower temperatures. The lumped kinetic model developed by Hui and
Hamielec presented an excellent agreement with the experimental data
for both thermal and pressure hazards during the adiabatic thermal
runaway. The study revealed the complex role of solvent (ethylbenzene)
regarding the polymerization runaway hazards. Addition of solvents
into the polymerization system to mitigate the thermal risk may introduce
pressure risks because of the volatile nature of the solvent. Optimum
process design should be based on a thorough assessment of all types
of hazards present in the system.
