This work features the first-time use of poly(trimethylene
terephthalate)
(PTT), a biobased engineering thermoplastic, for fused deposition
modeling (FDM) applications. Additives such as chain extenders (CEs)
and impact modifiers are traditionally used to improve the processability
of polymers for injection molding; as a proof of concept for their
use in FDM, the same strategies were applied to PTT to improve its
printability. The filament processing conditions and printing parameters
were optimized to generate complete, warpage-free samples. The blends
were characterized through physical, thermal, viscoelastic, and morphological
analyses. In the optimal blend (90 wt % PTT, 10 wt % impact modifier,
and 0.5 phr CE), the filament diameter was improved by ∼150%,
the size of the spherulites significantly decreased to 5% of the ∼26
μm spherulite size found in neat PTT, and the melt flow index
decreased to ∼4.7 g/10 min. From this blend, FDM samples with
a high impact performance of ∼61 J/m were obtained, which are
comparable to other conventional FDM thermoplastics. The ability to
print complete and warpage-free samples from this blend suggests a
new filament feedstock material for industrial and home-use FDM applications.
This paper discusses methods to improve hard-to-print polymers and
presents the improved printability of PTT as proof of these methods’
effectiveness.

1 Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D)
printing is an additive manufacturing (AM)
process with the benefit of high customization and cost effectiveness
for complex parts or prototypes.1 Fused
deposition modeling (FDM) or fused filament fabrication is a 3D printing
method that extrudes a thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle
to build a physical part based on a computer-aided design (CAD) model.
This technology is increasing in popularity and is used for both rapid
prototyping and component manufacturing,1 where it has been used in biomedical and industrial applications.2

One of the most common polymers used in
FDM is poly(lactic acid)
(PLA),3 which is both a biobased and biodegradable
polymer. Recently, researchers have combined PLA with natural fillers,
such as microcrystalline cellulose, to diversify its mechanical performance4 while maintaining its renewability. Other works
have combined petroleum-based polymers with natural fillers or fibers,
such as lignin,5 biochar,6 and biogenic carbon,7 to improve
renewability and mechanical performances. Recycling polymers, such
as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), for improved sustainability
have also been of interest to generate new filament feedstocks.6 Other recycled polymers include poly(ethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate),
which is derived from biomass and recycled and reused successfully
for FDM.8 The use of these polymers and
composites alleviates some of the environmental concerns with regard
to waste and renewability, as well as addresses the use of sustainable
polymers for FDM.9

Other commonly
used materials for FDM are engineering thermoplastics,
such as polyamides (PAs) and polycarbonates (PCs),10 that offer some benefits over traditional thermoplastics.
One of the most commonly used engineering thermoplastics in AM is
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)3 because
of its superior thermal stability and mechanical properties. However,
ABS is nonbiodegradable and petroleum-sourced. The added benefits
of engineering thermoplastics and sustainable polymers create the
demand for more variability in FDM feedstocks. Focus has begun to
shift to the development and modification of other engineering thermoplastics
and sustainable polymers for FDM technologies.9,11

Engineering thermoplastics from renewable sources have the potential
to generate products with exceptional mechanical performance and improved
thermal stability, while addressing environmental concerns. Poly(trimethylene
terephthalate) (PTT) is a partially biobased engineering thermoplastic
which displays mechanical properties similar to nylon and chemical
properties similar to PET.12 However, the
semicrystalline nature of this polymer can cause challenges during
3D printing. Semicrystalline polymers are less commonly used in FDM
because of shrinkage and warpage caused by formation of crystalline
regions during cooling of deposited layers.13 Engineering thermoplastic polyesters, such as PTT, PET, and poly(butylene
terephthalate) (PBT), are often difficult to be 3D printed because
of their high melting temperatures, crystallinity, and hydrophilic
nature.14 Printing polyesters can be improved
with the addition of additives. For example, PBT and carbon nanotubes/graphene
have been printed to generate mechanically robust and highly functional
products.15 Likewise, additives present
in recycled PET led to improved printability, as compared to neat
PET, to create complete, warpage-free samples.14 Printing of these polymers can be improved with the help
of additives such as nucleation inhibitors, chain extenders (CEs),
and reactive compatibilizers or by blending with other polymers.

An impact modifier contains reactive epoxy groups which react with
the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups16 of polymer
chains to improve performance. Studies have analyzed the interaction
of impact modifiers with polyesters17 to
improve their toughness18 and increase
the melt strength of these polymers. The addition of an impact modifier
may increase the dimensional stability of the filaments for FDM applications.
Further improvements to FDM-printed materials were predicted to occur
with the addition of a CE. A CE can be added to polymers to prevent
polymer degradation and help increase their thermal stability. This
may aid in filament printing by increasing the polymer’s melt
viscosity. Rasselet et al.19 used a CE
with PLA/nylon 11 blends to compatibilize the materials and improve
the printability. Zander et al.14 proposed
the use of CEs to improve the printability of FDM-recycled PET. Therefore,
it is likely that these materials can be added to polymers to successfully
optimize for FDM.

The success of FDM is highly dependent on
the printing parameters
used, including bed temperature, nozzle temperature, print speed,
and layer height, which can all have effects on the properties and
printability of a FDM-printed part.20−22 The parameters can be
optimized for product finish, tailored mechanical performances, cost
savings through material reduction, and product efficiency through
management of speed and quality. Torres et al.20 studied the impact of relative density, thickness, print
temperature, infill direction, print speed, and orientation on the
mechanical performance of PLA. On the basis of optimization of printing
parameters, they concluded that a part with good tensile and fracture
properties required a layer thickness of 0.3 mm, a raster angle/infill
density of 45°/135°, and a perimeter added to each part.20 Benwood et al.21 studied
the effect of melt temperature, bed temperature, and raster angle
of PLA to improve impact strength and heat resistance. With optimal
print orientation raster angles of 45° and 135°, the authors
determined that the mechanical performance can be changed by variation
of temperature parameters and that the bed temperature had a large
effect on the thermal analysis of the samples because of the changes
in crystallinity. Anitha et al.22 optimized
printing parameters for desirable surface finishes. They performed
a Taguchi design of experiments to determine the effect of print speed,
layer thickness, and road width with ABS. The authors determined that
surface finish is most affected by the layer thickness. Printing parameters
must be investigated to optimize the properties of FDM materials.

Because there is a constant desire in AM to generate new polymer
blends or composites with a larger variety of mechanical performances,23 this work addresses the concerns of limited
filament feedstocks commercially available.24 A larger number of FDM materials can be adapted to function for
more applications in industry and home printing.25 Three fundamental aspects for 3D printing are discussed
in this work: (1) methods commonly implemented to improve injection
molding practices can be applied to FDM to reduce warpage and improve
processability or printability; (2) the combination of additives (impact
modifier and CE) with neat polymers can theoretically improve the
printability of other challenging highly crystalline polymers; and
(3) unique blends of additives and PTT can lead to a larger variety
of filament feedstocks to foster the use of FDM in a larger variety
of applications. This paper features the novel use of biobased PTT
as a 3D printing material for FDM. To the best of authors’
knowledge, no other work has been completed with PTT as a FDM feedstock.
Although there are many studies on the effect of printing parameters,
investigation into the effect of additives such as CEs and impact
modifiers on printability is limited.

2 Results and Discussion
This work was
completed in two parts. The first part features strand
optimization to increase printability, followed by printing optimization
and characterization of the blend’s properties. The nomenclature
and composition for the blends can be found in Table 1.

2.1 Stand Optimization
It is essential
in FDM that filaments are dimensionally suited to the specific printer’s
parameters. Consistency in filament diameter is also imperative to
ensure proper feeding through the nozzle. The printer used in this
study, a Lulzbot Taz 6 printer, has a minimum filament diameter recommendation
of 1.75 mm. Neat PTT filaments processed on the Leistritz at 250 °C
and 100 rpm (in accordance with the literature29), with a feed rate of 5 kg/h and a collector speed of 600
rpm, had filament diameters of approximately 1.4–1.6 mm with
poor consistency. As can be seen in Figure 1, the filaments generated were very thin,
had poor consistency when printing, and showed a tendency to jam the
nozzle, which resulted in difficulties to print a completed part.
Thin filaments often result in slippage and buckling of the filament
in the feeding system, or underfilling of the rasters which leads
to poor inter-raster cohesion.30 Various
strategies were attempted to optimize the extruded filament. Processing
conditions were modified, and additives were introduced to create
printable strands. The success of these techniques to optimize PTT
filaments indicates that they could be applied to develop a variety
of polymers for FDM.

Figure 1 Schematic of the challenges posed by thin filaments in
FDM.

Screw speed was investigated as it was anticipated
that a reduced
screw speed would decrease the shear rate on the melted polymer, thereby
increasing its viscosity31 and the resultant
strand diameter. However, this was found to have a negligible effect
with all filament diameters measured at ∼1.7 mm, thereby suggesting
that further optimization was needed. Therefore, the original 100
rpm speed was maintained to match the literature values.17,18 The effect of barrel temperature was also investigated. With reduced
temperature, PTT becomes more viscous.28,29 Therefore,
at lower melt temperatures, the material should be pushed out of the
die in thicker strands. This was observed in the PTT strands with
the diameter increasing by 116% from 1.42 mm for 250 °C processed
filaments. 240 °C was chosen as the optimal barrel temperature
to maintain thicker strands. To further improve the filament diameter,
factors such as feed rate and collector speed were investigated. A
consistent feed rate can lead to a constant weight and composition.32 Feed rate is the rate of material fed into the
hopper. By varying the feed rate between 5 and 8 kg/h, 7 kg/h was
determined to be the optimal rate, which was verified by producing
strands with the greatest diameter without overloading the screw.
The 7 kg/h feed rate produced samples with a filament diameter of
1.98 mm on average, which was 113% greater than the 5 kg/h samples.
The 8 kg/h samples produced even larger diameters, but there was high
shear on the screws. Because the 7 kg/h filament diameter was within
the printing range, it was chosen as the ideal feed rate. As noted
by Chung,32 the feed rate contributes to
beneficial conditions, such as improved bulk density, a higher melting
point, a small surface area-to-volume ratio, and reduced friction
from the hopper surface. Collector speed is the speed at which the
wheel that draws the material through the water bath spins. This speed
needs to be chosen to ensure that the filaments are pulled fast enough
through the water bath to avoid kinking and build ups of material
but slow enough to maintain diameters larger than 1.75 mm. The resulting
optimized speed was 465 rpm. The lower collection speed increases
the cooling time of the filament, which allows the filament to maintain
dimensional stability by cooling it to a complete internal temperature
below the glass-transition temperature.33 Therefore, the slower collection rate improved the filament thickness.

With a melt temperature of 240 °C, a screw speed of 100 rpm,
a feed rate of 7 kg/h, and a collection rate of 465 rpm, the strands
had a thick enough diameter to print, but the print quality was poor.
Samples that did print were very warped and the nozzle continued to
jam because of uneven diameters throughout the strand. The effects
of additives were investigated to determine their impact on filament
size, consistency, and printability.

The effect of a CE (SA-GMA)
on the printability of PTT was investigated
because CEs can increase the melt stability of the polymer.26 PTT was unable to print at a temperature of
250 °C in the Lulzbot printer. Therefore, higher temperature
was required to extrude the filament for printing. After several optimization
printing processes, we found that the PTT filament was able to extrude
and flow properly at 290 °C. In order to avoid severe degradation
of PTT when printing at high temperature, a small amount (0.25–0.50
phr) of CE (SA-GMA) was added. We found that the SA-GMA CE could improve
the dimensional stability and consistency of the PTT filament during
processing. The addition of 0.5 phr SA-GMA resulted in an average
strand diameter, ∼140% the size of the neat PTT strand, as
can be seen in Figure 2b. A visual schematic of the changes in filament diameter is displayed
in Figure 2. The CE
contains numerous functional groups, which can interact with the broken
PTT chains,34 thereby increasing the branching
of the polymer, which leads to an increase in molecular weight and
overall improved thermal stability.35 The
addition of SA-GMA made the filaments to be within the allowable size
for the printer; however, the printed parts displayed delamination
and had poor dimensional accuracy because of the material’s
tendency to expand and swell after printing, which is discussed in
later sections (Figure 6).

Figure 2 (a) Schematic of the effect of addition of a CE on filament diameter
and (b) average filament diameter of blends (ii–ix show the
results after processing conditions were optimized).

The effect of EBA-GMA as an impact modifier and
thermal stabilizer
was also studied. EBA-GMA had minimal effect on filament diameter
but increased its consistency; therefore, the optimal content was
10 wt %. EBA-GMA was anticipated to have pronounced interactions with
the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of PTT18 as seen in the proposed reactions shown in Scheme 1.18 The addition
of only EBA-GMA did not show any impact on printability as the filaments
still tended to buckle above the heating chamber and printed parts
still experienced warpage.

Scheme 1 Two Possible Reactions between EBA-GMA and
PTT Adapted and Redrawn
from Chang et al.18
A combination of EBA-GMA and SA-GMA was tested
(0–15 wt
% EBA-GMA and 0–0.5 phr SA-GMA). These blends showed good consistency
in filament diameter and had diameters above the required 1.75 mm
diameter. In order to produce high toughness PTT, 10 wt % EBA-GMA
was chosen as the optimal EBA-GMA content. The printable blends possessed
some of the highest viscosities, as compared to the neat polymer.
Hwang et al. explained that highly viscous materials act as an incompressible
Newtonian fluid during processing, which results in a consistent cross
section and increased diameter.36

The combination of SA-GMA and EBA-GMA was essential for the success
of processing filaments and printing blends. On the basis of works
from You et al.,17 the number of epoxy
equivalent groups on SA-GMA is ∼24. This is derived from the
number of epoxy group equal to the molecular weight of SA-GMA divided
by the equivalent weight of epoxy (6800 g mol–1/285
g mol–1). On the basis of the assumption that SA-GMA
contains nearly 10 times the content of glycidyl methacrylate,17 the EBA-GMA would potentially contain ∼2
reactive epoxy groups. Therefore, a combination of SA-GMA was needed
to branch the polymer and EBA-GMA to increase the length of the polymer
chains to improve the dimensional stability of the samples.

When optimizing filaments for printing, processing conditions should
be investigated to ensure that optimal strands are produced. Filament
diameters were increased from ∼1.4 to ∼2.0 mm just by
optimizing the processing conditions of screw speed, barrel/melt temperature,
feed rate, and collector speed. To further improve the printability
of a polymer, the effect of additives should be investigated. The
CE and impact modifier improved filament consistency and resulted
in a printable, warpage-free blend (as discussed in the later section).

2.2 PTT-Based Blends and Their Characterization
The blends of PTT, EBA-GMA, and SA-GMA were characterized to investigate
the impact of the additives on PTT’s properties and printability.

2.2.1 Physical Properties of Filaments
The filament diameter, melt flow index (MFI), and density were measured
for neat PTT and its blends and are displayed in Table S1. The average diameter of neat PTT increased significantly
to ∼2 mm because of the optimization of processing conditions
from its original ∼1.4 mm diameter. The average diameter continued
to increase with the increase of SA-GMA and EBA-GMA content. This
was likely as a result of the bonding between polymer and additives,
which acted to stabilize the melt flow and increase the filament size.
MFI is a measure of a material’s flowability and is linked
to a material’s viscosity. MFI drastically decreased with the
addition of EBA-GMA, which is attributed to EBA-GMA’s tendency
to increase the melt viscosity. SA-GMA also decreased MFI, which can
be attributed to decreased chain mobility from increased cross-linking.
The use of both an impact modifier and a CE increased the reactivity
of the blends as noted by the reduced MFI. The density of the blends
decreased with increasing EBA-GMA content because of the replacement
of PTT with a lower density component (i.e., EBA-GMA with a density
of 0.94 g/cm3).37

Filaments
with less than 0.5 phr of SA-GMA still exhibited issues with warpage
and buckling of the filament. This was due to their more inconsistent
diameters, as they exhibited bumpier filaments, as displayed in Figure 2. Approximately 5.0
g/10 min appeared to be the minimum acceptable MFI value, as the 85/15/0.5
blend with a MFI less than 3.0 g/10 min experienced issues with underextrusion
and poor flow during printing. The neat PTT had the opposite issue
and experienced overflow not controlled by the feed system during
printing, suggesting very high flowability. For successful extrusion,
the filament needs to act as the piston pushing the material through
the heating chamber.30 Nonideal flow behavior
can result in a filament that is unable to successfully push the filament
through, causing unregulated flow and jamming.30

2.2.2 Mechanical Properties of Injection-Molded
Samples
The mechanical properties of the injection-molded
samples for the blends were studied and are displayed in Table S2. The tensile and flexural strength as
well as the modulus decreased with increasing EBA-GMA content in the
PTT blend. This trend is typical of EBA-GMA blends, which was seen
in the work by Yuryev et al.38 in PLA/PC
blends.

The notched impact strength of the neat polymer and
its blends can be seen in Figure 3. The notched impact strength of the samples increased
to ∼240% in the 90/10/0.5 blends, as compared to the neat PTT.
The sharp increase in notched impact strength value seen from 5 to
10 wt % EBA-GMA blends (from ∼50 to 98 J/m) can be classified
as the brittle–ductile transition, which is typically seen
with elastomer impact modifiers.38 No significant
improvement was observed with further increase in EBA-GMA content
to 15 wt % (i.e., 85/15/0.5 blend). This suggested that 10 wt % EBA-GMA
could be sufficient for optimal results to achieve a desirable impact
strength in PTT. Therefore, 10 wt % EBA-GMA was chosen for the ideal
formulation. The 90/10/0.5 blend had good toughness properties and
is very desirable because of its drastically improved impact strength.
As seen in injection molding work,38 impact
modifiers can be used to tailor material properties to desired values.
The same can be done with regard to tailoring properties for FDM applications.
The increase in impact strength is beneficial to help maintain higher
strength in FDM parts, as FDM materials with poor layer cohesion can
result in decreased mechanical properties, as can be seen in Figure 7.

Figure 3 Notched impact strength
of neat PTT and blends.

2.2.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to analyze the melting
temperature (Tm), heat of fusion (ΔHm), and degree of crystallinity, which are shown
in Table S3. The melting temperature of
neat PTT was the lowest at 227.87 °C, which is similar to the
reported literature values.39 EBA-GMA and
SA-GMA did not significantly affect the melting temperature. The heat
of fusion (ΔHm) was ∼51 J/g
for neat PTT and decreased to ∼46, 42, and 38 J/g for the 95/5/0.5,
90/10/0.5, and 85/5/0.5 blends, respectively. In works by Reddy et
al.,39 additives to a PTT matrix also decreased
the heat of fusion. This decrease is most likely caused by additives
limiting the rearrangement of polymeric chains.

It is important
to note that the cold crystallization temperatures were not detected
on the DSC analysis of PTT and its blends. Therefore, the crystallization
is based on the exothermic enthalpy peak. The degree of crystallinity
decreased from a maximal value of ∼40% for neat PTT to ∼28–33%
in the blends. In works completed by Najafi et al.,40 SA-GMA was found to cause long-chain branched polymer structures
in PLA blends, which disrupted the ability of the polymer chains to
pack closely, decreasing crystallization.40 EBA-GMA possesses similar effects in interrupting the crystallization
process of PTT, which also contributed to reducing the overall crystallinity
of the blends.

The degree of crystallinity is less predictable
via DSC analysis
for the 3D printed part as the crystallization can vary during the
printing process. It has been discussed that the crystallization rates
for parts made by FDM are more impacted by (1) thermodynamic stability
of the materials, (2) print resolution, and (3) bonding resultant
of macroscopic fusion, followed by molecular diffusion.41 These factors can be adjusted to change the
crystallinity of the samples. By reducing the crystallinity of the
samples, the warpage and distortion of the 3D printed part can be
reduced.41 Polymers with high crystallinity
distort and warp more during FDM because of polymer chain condensation
when forming crystalline regions, which causes the layers to shrink
and pull up from the build platform.13 An
additional issue was the nonuniform cooling in the part because of
the lack of a regulated chamber temperature in the tabletop 3D printer.
Nonuniform cooling throughout the part can cause stress imbalances
in the part, contributing to warpage. Neat PTT FDM samples exhibited
the worst warpage because of the higher degree of crystallinity. The
reduced crystallinity is also corroborated with the polarized optical
microscopy (POM) results as shown in Figure 4, where a drastic reduction in spherulite
size was observed in the POM images. The blends still experienced
warpage apart from the printable 90/10/0.5 blend. This indicated that
other factors are also responsible for the printability of the material.
Most polymers with high crystallinity will experience issues while
printing warpage-free parts. The addition of additives to modify the
crystalline regions can be crucial for successful printing, as can
be seen in this work with PTT.

(as discussed in the Materials and Methods section) for samples of (a)
neat PTT, (b) 95/5/0.5, (c) 90/10/0.5, and (d) 85/15/0.5 blends.

2.2.4 Polarized Optical Microscopy
Crystallization
was also investigated with POM. Neat PTT was found to exhibit a two-dimensional
spherulite structure, where the distinctive pattern shown in Figure 4a is called a Maltese
cross-extinction pattern.42,43 Large spherulite sizes
were present in the neat PTT, with an average size of ∼26 μm.

The addition of SA-GMA to a polymer is known to increase the molecular
weight of the new blend through the reactive extrusion process.27,44 The increase in molecular weight may have resulted in decreased
spherulite size because of the increase in nucleation density.43 This is only one possible explanation for the
results obtained. Another suggested reason for reduced spherulite
size may have resulted from the increase in molecular weight, which
hinders the chain mobility of the macromolecular structure and prevents
spherulite growth.43 The resulting reduced
spherulite regions and smaller crystals can be seen in Figure 4 in all the blends, where spherulite
sizes were reduced to a minimum of ∼2.8% of the original neat
PTT size (Table S4).

As discussed
in the Differential Scanning
Calorimetry section, reduced crystallinity is very important
for successful printing. The reductions in spherulite size and percent
crystallinity contributed to the reduction of warpage in the 90/10/0.5
blend. Smaller crystalline regions result in a reduction in polymer
chain movement during cooling, which in turn reduces the stresses
pulling the sample off the build platform.13 Studies have been done on the effect of crystallization on injection-molded
samples and the same principles can be applied. Chang and Tsaur discuss
that shrinkage, warpage, and shrink marks are correlated with the
crystallization characteristics of a polymer during injection molding.45

2.2.5 Rheology
Rheological analysis was
performed on the PTT blends. Figure 5a,b,c presents the complex viscosity, storage modulus,
and loss modulus of the PTT blends as a function of angular frequency,
respectively. The melt flow behavior of neat PTT exhibited almost
Newtonian flow behavior with slight shear thinning at high angular
frequencies. The blends gradually changed from Newtonian flow to shear
thinning behavior with increasing additive content. This showed that
the viscosity of the PTT blends is more sensitive to high shearing
action upon melting in comparison to neat PTT. The 85/15/0.5 blend
experienced the greatest complex viscosity at lower frequencies, which
is due to the highly viscous nature of EBA-GMA. SA-GMA also acted
to increase the viscosity of the blends. The increase of viscosity
with increasing EBA-GMA/SA-GMA content is consistent with the MFI
results (see Table S1). The functionalized
epoxy groups available in EBA-GMA and SA-GMA are highly reactive at
high temperatures. Chang et al.18 found
that the phase compatibility and grafting reactions are more effective
when both EBA-GMA and SA-GMA are used, which resulted in higher melt
viscosity and impact strength in PLA/PBT blends.

Figure 5 Frequency sweep for PTT
and blends to determine (a) complex viscosity,
(b) storage modulus, and (c) loss modulus.

The storage modulus and loss modulus of PTT increased
after incorporating
EBA-GMA and SA-GMA. This can be related to the formation of the PTT-g-EBA-GMA copolymer. Similar observations were reported
by You et al. where the storage moduli of PET doubled with the presence
of SA-GMA or EBA-GMA individually.17

Complex viscosity is an important factor in the printability of
a material. Polymers with very high viscosities have difficulties
in printing as there are issues with the extrusion of the material.
This can lead to inconsistent flow from the nozzle or jamming. PTT
blends with complex viscosities below ∼3000 Pa s at low angular
frequencies had better flow through the printing nozzle. This issue
led to the inability to print the 85/15/0.5 blend because of poor
flowability. Shear rates during FDM are typically quite high;46 therefore, the complex viscosity in the optimal
90/10/0.5 blend during FDM is likely closer to ∼800 Pa s.

2.3 FDM of PTT-Based Blends
2.3.1 Printability of Neat PTT and Blends
The 90/10/0.5 blend was the only successful blend at printing warpage
free, complete samples, as can be seen in Figure 7. The other blends experienced issues with
flowability and warpage, as presented in Figure 6. Warpage was evaluated by visual inspection, and samples
were determined to have warped if detachment from the printing bed
was seen. Often warped samples could not be completed because of issues
with complete detachment from the bed and were not analyzed for their
mechanical performances. Printing parameters such as printing speed,
bed temperature, nozzle temperature, and layer height were manipulated
within the Lulzbot Taz 6’s capabilities to reduce warpage of
these materials. A systematic experiment into variations in these
parameters was performed with neat PTT to determine the optimal ranges
of these parameters. The ranges were then refined for each blend to
find the optimal values. On the basis of these observations, the range
of printing speeds investigated was 20–40 mm/s, bed temperature
was 40–70 °C, nozzle temperature was 270–290 °C,
and layer height was 0.3–0.5 mm. All other printing parameters
were kept constant. Some success was found in this, especially in
the 95/5/0.5 blend; however, issues were still found in larger prints
(such as for tensile and flexural bars). A common issue experienced
with warping samples is detachment from the bed during printing, which
results in incomplete samples. Warpage in these samples, as found
in works by Fitzharris et al.,13 was a
result of cooling conditions which caused the polymer chains to be
pulled together to form a more dense crystalline region which leads
to shrinkage and warpage. Less crystalline polymers such as PLA and
amorphous polymers such as ABS are less affected by this.13

Figure 6 Schematic of issues with FDM of neat PTT and blends.

The blends with only SA-GMA exhibited issues with
swelling and
delamination between layers. Swelling of an extrudate, also referred
to as the Barus effect, can be caused by a number of reasons, including
the mobility of polymer molecules, their bulkiness, the temperature
at the nozzle, and the cooling process of the extrudate.47 Work by Kishi and Iizuka47 indicated die swelling from extrusion processing, which
estimated that similar effects were found within the extrusion through
a FDM nozzle. The addition of EBA-GMA appeared to reduce swelling
as it was not observed in other blends. The 85/15/0.5 blend had poor
flowability through the nozzle and therefore could not print complete
parts without jamming.

2.3.2 Printability of the 90/10/0.5 Blend
The 90/10/0.5 blend was successful at printing both mechanical testing
bars and a complex part (a 4.5 cm tall ridged vase); however, this
blend could only print successfully under the specific set of printing
parameters shown in Figure 7. Changes in these parameters resulted in
warpage. A brim was essential for printing, which is commonly used
for semicrystalline, warpage-prone polymers, such as in the FDM of
polypropylene.48 This increased the surface
area of the initial layer and allowed for better adhesion of the samples
to the bed. Another essential print setting was the cooling fan rate
to be set to 5%. Fans at a higher rate caused the sample to cool too
quickly, which developed stresses in the part and influenced the crystallization
rate, which resulted in warpage.

Figure 7 90/10/0.5 FDM samples (impact bar and
small vase) printed at optimized
printing parameters.

The parameters shown in Figure 7 are the parameters commonly investigated
to optimize
printing.49−51 Melt temperature was the most crucial parameter and
most of the success was found at 290 °C. Nozzle temperatures
below this resulted in issues with inconsistent flow and poor adhesion.
Bed temperature is a very important factor for bed/part adhesion.
Spoerk et al.52 found that a bed temperature
slightly higher than the material’s glass-transition temperature
(Tg) is the optimal bed temperature for
printing. PTT’s Tg is in the range
of 45–55 °C;12 therefore, the
bed temperature was set at 55 °C. Layer height was set at 0.3
mm, and the corresponding settings on Cura were manipulated to produce
the nicest rasters and avoid over- and underextrusion. Print speed
was set at 40 mm/s, very high print speed resulted in uneven, broken
rasters, and very slow speed increased warpage and delamination as
it allowed for layers to cool completely before bonding to the next
layer. The raster angles were chosen to be 45° and 135°,
alternating each layer in a rectilinear fill pattern. Alternating
raster angles are often set at 90° to each other to maximize
the material fill and are set to avoid long raster lengths to reduce
the cooling time between adjacent rasters laid down.30 As shown in Figure 7, the combination of the 90/10/0.5 blend composition and these
optimized parameters resulted in parts with good dimensional stability
and excellent bed adhesion. This particular blend was able to successfully
print both mechanical testing bars and a complex part (a 4.5 cm tall
ridged vase) as presented in Figure 7.

An essential component of FDM is optimization
of printing parameters
that generally needs to be redone for every material and printer combination.
The parameters that were observed to have significant effects were
bed and melt temperature, layer height, and print speed. For warpage-prone
parts, investigating other factors might be necessary to make the
polymer printable. Without the reduction of cooling rate through decreased
fan, or increased adhesion to the bed through adding a brim, PTT would
have been unprintable. For successful printing, all these factors
must be considered.

2.3.3 Mechanical Properties of FDM Samples
Test samples were printed from the 90/10/0.5 blend using FDM technology
and the results are shown in Figure 7. Most of the FDM properties were reduced to approximately
half of their injection-molded counterparts. For example, flexural
strength in FDM parts reduced to 53% of the injection-molded value.
Reductions in properties have been observed in other FDM works, such
as in the work by Tuan Rahim et al., which focused on printing of
PA 12.10 They observed a reduction of 25%
in flexural strength between injection-molded and FDM-prepared parts.10 This is attributed to the method of production,
as FDM does not create uniform, solid parts. The presence of voids
between layers contributes to the decreased mechanical properties
as there is reduced interlayer bonding. Thermal stresses appear between
rasters because of the differences in temperature when bonding, which
allow fractures to propagate easier during impact testing.53 Because of the limitations in maximum nozzle
temperature on the printer, investigations into increased nozzle temperatures
to attempt to reduce these voids could not be done, limiting the improvements
available in mechanical properties. However, the notched impact strength
of the PTT blend still presented a strong value of ∼61 J/m.
The tensile strength of the 90/10/0.5 blend is comparable to that
of the other printable polyesters (recycled PET),14 as shown in Table S5, with regard
to tensile strength, which is only half of PLA’s FDM tensile
strength.21 In terms of impact strength,
the 90/10/0.5 blend is comparable to ∼187% greater PLA’s
strength depending on the printing conditions.21 This PTT blend exhibited properties comparable to other
printable polymers and exhibits good toughness.

2.3.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy
A
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the impact fracture
surfaces was performed on injection-molded neat PTT and the 90/10/0.5
blend, and the FDM 90/10/0.5 blend (shown in Figures S1a,b and 8, respectively). The neat
PTT sample showed ridges (as indicated by the arrow in Figure S1a) and flat sections on the fractured
impact surface, which confirm its brittle nature. The injection-molded
90/10/0.5 blend showed rougher surface morphology with fewer ridges.

Figure 8 Schematic
of layers and corresponding gaps/voids in a FDM part
with micrographs taken at 15 kV of the fractured impact surface of
90/10/0.5 FDM samples displaying (a) raster adhesion and (b) layer
adhesion.

The surface of the FDM blend sample appeared similar
to its injection-molded
counterpart. As shown in Figure 8, FDM-printed parts are deposited layer by layer in
a vertical build direction. Depending on material and printing properties,
and interlayer cohesion, gaps or voids can develop between layers.
In Figure 8a,b, the
intersections between layers and rasters can be seen. Large gaps were
seen at these intersections, which indicated poor cohesion between
layers, which is likely due to the decreased mechanical properties.
Gaps between layers are common in many 3D printed samples. In fact,
Weng et al. stated that the gaps are unavoidable without further work
in FDM of ABS.54 Cohesion can be improved
through altering the melt temperature. Benwood et al. found that increasing
the melt or nozzle temperature resulted in decreased void size between
layers. For maximum diffusion and cohesion of a material between layers,
the extruded filament needs to be hot enough to partially melt the
preceding layer. Rapid cooling, particularly in the outer shell region,
also resulted in larger voids between layers.21 The samples printed in this study are printed at the maximum temperature
of the Lulzbot Taz 6; therefore, further investigation of increased
melt temperature could not be achieved.

3 Conclusions
In this work, PTT was able
to 3D print complete and warpage-free
samples because of the modifications made in processing and printing
parameters, and with the assistance of additives. The successful completion
of samples with FDM PTT using these methods confirms the potential
ability of these techniques to help improve the printability of other
difficult-to-print polymers. The addition of a CE and an impact modifier
was crucial to improve the printability of PTT. The use of these additives
was a proof of concept that suggested that traditional strategies
used in injection molding can be transposed to FDM. Successful printing
was dependent on a number of factors changed by these additives, including
(1) a reduction in MFI by 84% from the neat PTT value, (2) a change
from spherulites to crystals with a 93.4% size reduction from neat
PTT (less crystalline polymers experience less warpage), and (3) a
reduction in the degree of crystallinity by 18% from that of the neat
polymer. The printed samples possessed tensile strength similar to
3D printed PET and impact strength similar to 3D printed PLA, at 35.3
MPa and 61.3 J/m, respectively. This work represents a new potential
use for PTT in the AM field. As a partially biobased polymer, PTT
has strong promise as a more sustainable material to be used in FDM
as compared to complete petroleum-based engineering thermoplastics.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
PTT, trademarked as Sorona
(Dupont, Delaware, USA), is an engineering thermoplastic with 37%
biobased content12 and a molecular weight
of 56 300 g/mol.26 PTT pellets were
used as the neat polymer matrix to generate filaments for FDM. Poly(styrene-acrylic-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (SA-GMA), trademarked as Joncryl
4368 (BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany), was used as a CE because of its
reactive epoxy group. The molecular weight of SA-GMA is 6800 g/mol.27 The reactive epoxy group is contained within
the glycidyl methacrylate segment of the molecule at 49.8 wt %. According
to the literature, the epoxy equivalent weight for this molecule is
285 g/mol.17 Poly(ethylene-n-butylene-acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (EBA-GMA),
commonly named Elvaloy PTW (Dupont, Delaware, USA), was used in combination
with PTT as an impact modifier. EBA-GMA contains 5.25 wt % glycidyl
methacrylate. Because SA-GMA contains nearly 10 times more glycidyl
methacrylate by weight, it is inferred that SA-GMA is 10 times more
reactive. Further details are discussed in the literature by You et
al.17

4.2 Blend Preparation
PTT was dried at
80 °C for 24 h prior to processing, such that the moisture content
was below 0.5%. Moisture was analyzed with a Sartorius AG Moisture
Analyzer (Gottingen, Germany). Minimal moisture was very important
when processing PTT to reduce the risk of hydrolysis degradation during
processing. After drying, SA-GMA was powdered and physically mixed
before processing.

4.3 Processing Conditions
4.3.1 Filaments
Blended materials were
fed in the hopper of a Leistritz-Micro-27 (Nuremberg, Germany) twin
screw extruder under a corotating configuration. The processing temperature
was 250 °C with a screw speed of 100 rpm. After leaving the die,
the filaments ran through a cold water bath and were collected and
dried. The complete extent of the reaction between the epoxy side
chains and PTT is unknown but could be investigated in further works.

4.3.2 Injection-Molded Samples
Filaments
were pelletized and dried to a moisture content of ≤0.2%. Injection-molded
samples were processed in an Arburg AllRounder 77 Ton Co-Injection
Molding Machine (Loßburg, Germany). Parameters used were a melt
temperature of 240, a mold temperature of 80 °C, and a hold time
of 20 s.

4.3.3 FDM Samples
FDM testing samples
were modeled using CAD on SolidWorks by Dassault Systems (Vélizy-Villacoublay,
France). Cura LulzBot Edition (2.6.69) software was used to run the
3D printer. Samples were printed on a LulzBot Taz 6 printer (Loveland,
USA) with a borosilicate glass/polyethyleneimine build plate and a
0.50 mm diameter nozzle. The same configuration has been implemented
in previous works.55 Printing parameters,
such as nozzle and build platform temperatures, print speed, and layer
height, varied depending on the blend compositions. Other parameters
were kept constant throughout printing, such as 100% infill density,
5% fan cooling rate, orientation of parts along the x-axis, and a raster angle of 45°. Various bed coatings, such
as tape and glue, were investigated, but most of the success was found
on a naked bed.

4.4 Mechanical Testing
4.4.1 Tensile and Flexural Testing
Tensile
and flexural samples were tested on a Universal testing machine model
3382 (Instron, Massachusetts). Tensile and flexural tests were carried
out according to ASTM D638 standard type IV and ASTM D790, respectively.
Tensile tests were carried out with samples placed between pneumatic
grips at strain rates of 50 mm/min for injection-molded parts and
5 mm/min for FDM parts, as per time requirements of the standard.
Flexural tests were carried out with a span length of 52 mm and a
cross head speed of 14 mm/min. The same flexural testing procedure
was used on other 3D printed samples from this lab.REF55

4.4.2 Impact Testing
Notched Izod impact
testing was conducted, according to ASTM D256, on a Zwick/Roell HIT25P
impact tester (Ulm, Germany) with a hammer capacity of 2.75 J.

4.5 Physical Analysis
4.5.1 Melt Flow Index
MFI was used as
a relative estimate of the viscosity of the samples. Materials (6–8
g) were placed in the heating chamber of a Qualitest melt flow indexer
(Qualitest, Connecticut, USA) in accordance with ASTM D1238 and tested
at 250 °C.

4.5.2 Average Diameter
The diameter of
the strands was measured 10 times at intervals along a 50 cm section
of the filament with calipers and averaged.

4.5.3 Density
An electronic densimeter
(Alfa Mirage, Osaka, Japan) was used to measure the density of the
samples. Each blend was tested three times with different samples
and averaged.

4.6 Characterization
4.6.1 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
DSC Q200 (TA Instruments, Delaware, USA) was used with a nitrogen
flow rate of 50 mL/min to perform heat–cool–heat cycle
analysis. The cycles were performed from 0 to 250 °C at a rate
of 10 °C/min, and data were taken from the second heating cycle.
The degree of crystallinity was calculated from eq 1 below 1  where ΔHm is the heat of fusion, Wf is the weight
content of PTT, and ΔHmo is the heat of fusion for 100%
crystalline PTT (30 kJ/mol)28 (which is
equivalent to 145.5 J/g). The PTT content was 1 for the neat polymer
and varies between 0.95, 0.90, and 0.85 for the respective blends.

4.6.2 Rheology
Rheological analysis was
completed on a Modular Compact Rheometer 302 (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria)
to determine complex viscosity, storage modulus, and loss modulus.
The samples (1 mm thick, 12 mm in diameter) were tested at 250 °C
in a nitrogen gas environment with the frequency sweep test with an
angular frequency of 0.1–100 rad/s using a parallel plate geometry.

4.6.3 Microscopy
POM (Nikon, New York,
USA) was used to observe the crystalline structures within the samples.
Samples were microtomed to a thickness of 1 μm, before being
imaged. This resulted in the use of injection-molded samples to ensure
consistent and complete samples. SEM (Phenom-world ProX, Eindhoven,
Netherlands) analysis was performed on the impact-fractured surface.
The SEM images were formed with a 10 and 15 kV acceleration voltage
and zoom from 500 to 5000 times.
