Calcite-impregnated hydrochar (Ca-HC)
was successfully synthesized
by a one-step hydrothermal method and used as an adsorbent for Cu(II)
remediation. Characterization techniques showed that Ca-HC contained
calcite and oxygen-containing functional groups. A series of Cu(II)
sorption experiments onto Ca-HC showed that the initial Cu(II) concentration,
contact time, sorption temperature, and initial pH of the solution
influenced the sorption of Cu(II). The actual achievable sorption
capacity of Ca-HC for Cu(II) was 130.57 mg g–1 at
303 K, and the sorption process obeyed the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order
kinetic equation. The precipitation and surface complexation rather
than ion exchange were mainly ascribed to the removal of Cu(II) onto
Ca-HC. The calcite provided the active site to produce posnjakite
precipitation during the sorption process and enhance the sorption
capacity of the hydrochar. Therefore, these results demonstrated that
Ca-HC is an effective sorbent that can remove Cu(II) from water.

1 Introduction
With
the ongoing development of modern industry, water pollution
caused by industrial sewage containing heavy metals has become a serious
environmental problem, which is harmful to the health of human beings
and ecological systems due to high toxicity, nondegradability, and
bioenrichment of heavy metals in nature.1,2 Therefore,
it is of great significance to purify wastewater contaminated by heavy
metals before it is discharged to the natural environment. Up to now,
various technologies have been developed to remove the heavy metals
including ionic exchange,3 precipitation,3 adsorption,3 chemical
reduction,4 electrochemical methods,3 and membrane separation.3 Among these treatment methods, adsorption is a prevailing approach
to remove heavy metals from wastewater due to its low cost and simple
operation. However, the widespread application of adsorption has been
largely restricted because the common adsorbents such as activated
carbon,5 zeolite,6 and other carbon-based materials7,8 are expensive
and/or difficult to regenerate. Thus, it is very desirable to prepare
an efficient, environmental-friendly, and economical adsorbent to
isolate heavy metals from wasterwater.

Recently, hydrochar,
a carbon-rich solid material derived from
plant residues and agricultural wastes under hydrothermal technique,
has been explored extensively as an environmental-friendly and cost-effective
adsorbent for removing pollutants from aqueous environment because
it is abundant in reactive oxygen-containing functional groups, such
as hydroxyl and carboxylic acid functional groups.9−12 Some studies suggested that hydrochar
can remove heavy metals mainly through the surface complexation of
heavy metals with the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface
of the hydrochar.13−16 However, the sorption capacity of hydrochar for heavy metal is often
lower than that of pyrolyzed biochar.17,18 This is probably
because hydrochar may contain fewer mineral components than pyrolyzed
biochar. Many studies have indicated that both mineral fractions and
carbon fractions with aromatic structures and oxygen-containing functional
groups of biochar are involved in the sorption of heavy metals.19−21 The different sorption mechanisms depend on the properties of both
heavy metals and biochar produced by the types of feedstock and pyrolytic
temperature. The sorption of heavy metals by biochar with low mineral
contents is mostly attributed to surface complexations between heavy
metals and the oxygen-containing functional groups on the biochar
surface.19,20 However, biochar with rich mineral components,
such as manure biochar and sludge biochar, remove heavy metals mainly
through four different possible interactions (precipitation, electrostatic
interaction, cation exchange, and complexation) between heavy metals
and mineral components.19,22 Therefore, the mineral
fraction of biochar plays an important role in the heavy metal sorption
process. However, little attention is paid to the application of mineral-impregnated
hydrochar to remove heavy metals from the aqueous solution.23,24

Carbonate minerals exhibit an excellent ability to remove
heavy
metals, and the adsorption mechanism is considered to be precipitation
and ion exchange on the carbonate surface. It is well-known that calcium
carbonate (CaCO3) is one of the most abundant and cheapest
material found in nature and harmless to human being. Meanwhile, it
is proved that calcium carbonate can remove heavy metals from water.25−28 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a novel calcium carbonate
impregnated hydrochar adsorbent material that can enhance the capability
of hydrochar as an efficient and inexpensive adsorbent for the purification
of heavy-metal-contaminated water. The objectives of the work were
as follows: (1) synthesize calcite-impregnated hydrochar (Ca-HC) by
a simple hydrothermal method as an adsorbent to enhance the sorption
capacity of hydrochar for Cu(II); (2) compare the physicochemical
properties of Ca-HC with and without Cu(II) sorption by energy-dispersive
scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM–EDX),
elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD); (3) evaluate the effect of solution pH, temperature,
contact time, concentration, and salt concentration on the sorption
capacity of Cu(II) by Ca-HC; and (4) analyze the sorption mechanisms
of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC based on the characteristics of Ca-HC and sorption
process.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations
of HC, Ca-HC, and Cu-HC
To characterize their surface morphology
and surface elemental
composition, Ca-HC and HC before and after adsorption were observed
by SEM–EDX. The SEM images showed that the surface of Ca-HC
was rougher and covered with more small particles than that of HC
(Figure S1a,b). The SEM–EDX analysis
showed that the content of the Ca element increased on the surfaces
of Ca-HC compared with that of the Ca element in HC (Figure S1e,f), which indicated the formation of calcite particles
on the surface of Ca-HC. After sorption of Cu(II), the atomic percentage
of Ca on the surface of Ca-HC obviously decreased while the elemental
Cu showed a marked increase through the EDX spectrum (Figure S1f,h). Based on the findings, Cu(II)
was adsorbed on the Ca-HC surface and calcite was involved in the
sorption process.

The XRD profiles of HC, Ca-HC, and Cu-HC are
shown in Figure 1a.
The peak at 2θ = 26.6° of the hydrochars was assigned to
graphite (JCPDS 26-1080).29,30 The weak diffraction
peaks of calcite (JCPDS 47-1743) was observed in HC. The increase
in the diffraction peaks of calcite (JCPDS 47-1743) in Ca-HC indicated
that the calcite was successfully incorporated into the hydrochar.31 After the sorption of Cu(II), the diffraction
peaks of calcite clearly decreased, while the strong peaks of posnjakite
(JCPDS 43-0670) and Cu4(SO4)(OH)6·2H2O, appeared.32 The
possible precipitation reaction (eq 1) is shown below 1  The C, H, S, and N contents of HC were 47.24,
5.48, 0.63, and 2.85%, while those of Ca-HC were 44.18, 5.00, 0.58,
and 2.47%, respectively. After the sorption of Cu(II), the C, H, S,
and N contents of Ca-HC were 40.02, 4.79, 1.41, and 1.72%, respectively.
In comparison to Ca-HC, the surface C content of Cu-HC decreased,
which might cause the dissolution of some CO32– from Ca-HC. However, the S content of Cu-HC increased greatly after
Cu(II) sorption. It could be explained that SO42– was introduced to the Cu-HC surface as a component of a newly formed
precipitate, which was consistent with the XRD data.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of HC,
Ca-HC, and Cu-HC. C, carbon; Q, calcite;
and P, posnjakite. (b) FTIR spectra of HC, Ca-HC, and Cu-HC.

Figure 1b illustrates
the FTIR spectra of HC, Ca-HC, and Cu-HC. For Ca-HC, the broad and
strong peak around 3342 cm–1 denote the −OH
stretching vibration.33 The band at 2917
cm–1 was typical of the stretching of aliphatic
C–H.9 The peak at 1607 cm–1 could be specified as the asymmetrically stretching vibration of
carboxylate (−COO–).30,33 The bands of 1160–1000 cm–1 were related
to the C–O stretching vibrations.34 Besides, the bands at 1430 and 875 cm–1 could
be attributed to the presence of carbonate, which increased significantly
compared with those in HC.33,35 After sorption of Cu(II),
the function groups undergo some significant changes. The asymmetric
stretching vibration of the −COO– group at
1607 cm–1 was changed to 1625 cm–1 and the symmetric stretching of the −COO– group at 1379 cm–1 became obvious, which showed
that chemical interactions occurred between the carboxyl group and
Cu(II) on the Ca-HC surface.30 The intensities
of bands at 1430 and 875 cm–1 became weak after
sorption, indicating that carbonates played a key role in Cu(II) sorption.36 The increase in the intensity of the band at
1060 cm–1 could be attributed to the introduction
of sulfate after sorption.37 The bands
at 1112, 793, 603, 515, and 434 cm–1 were attributed
to the presence of posnjakite.37 The results
of the FITR spectra, together with the XRD and elemental analysis,
demonstrated that sulfate as the main constituent of the precipitation
existed on the Cu-HC surface.

The BET surface area and pore
volume of HC were 11.54 m2 g–1 and 0.025247
cm3 g–1, while those of Ca-HC were 21.62
m2 g–1 and 0.064501 cm3 g–1, respectively,
which indicated that Ca-HC has a larger surface area and a higher
pore volume than HC. The porosities of HC and Ca-HC measured by mercury
porosimetry were 80.56% and 83.48%, respectively. Bulk densities of
HC and Ca-HC at 0.51 psia were 0.3096 and 0.2815 g mL–1, respectively. These results showed Ca-HC has a looser structure
than HC.

2.2 Sorption Performance of HC and Ca-HC
We compared the adsorption capacities of HC and Ca-HC to three different
initial concentrations of Cu(II) (30, 60, and 90 mg L–1), and the results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the adsorption capacities of HC for
the three different concentrations of Cu(II) were about 5 mg g–1, while those of Ca-HC were 33.67, 62.72, and 86.79
mg g–1, respectively. These results showed that
the adsorption capacities for Cu(II) on the hydrochar loaded with
calcite were obviously improved.

90 mg L–1, time = 12 h, T = 303
K, dose = 40 mg/50 mL).

2.3 Sorption
Isotherms for Cu(II) on Ca-HC
The Cu(II) sorption isotherms
onto Ca-HC are depicted in Figure 3a. The equilibrium
sorption capacities increased rapidly with increasing equilibrium
Cu(II) concentrations in the range from 0 to 60 mg L–1 and increased slowly above this range. It was obvious that increase
in temperature was conducive to increase in sorption capacities, which
showed that the sorption was an endothermic process.

Figure 3 (a) Sorption isotherms
of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC. (b) Linear fitting
of the sorption using the Langmuir isotherm model.

In general, sorption isotherm models have been widely applied
to
describe the phenomenon of controlling the release or movement of
adsorbate onto the solid from the solute and show the essence of interactions
between adsorbents and adsorbates. The Freundlich model (eq 2)38 and
Langmuir model (eq 3)39 are the two isotherm models applied to describe
the sorption characteristic of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC. The linear forms
for the two models are expressed in the following equations 2   3  where qe (mg g–1) and Ce (mg L–1) are
the sorption capacity of Cu(II) at an equilibrium and the Cu(II)
equilibrium concentration, respectively. n and KF (L mg–1) are the exponential
parameter of the Freundlich model and the Freundlich constant, respectively. Qo (mg g–1) and KL (mg1–1/n L1/n g–1) are the maximum sorption
capacity of Ca-HC and the Langmuir constant, respectively. The linear
fitting sorption of the Freundlich and Langmuir models are displayed
in Figures S2 and 3b, respectively. The corresponding parameters and the correlation
coefficients (R2) of the applied sorption
isotherm models are generalized in Table 1. It was apparent that the Langmuir sorption
model showed higher R2 values than the
Freundlich model at different temperatures. This result suggested
that the sorption isotherms were fitted well by the Langmuir equation
in which the monolayer coverage of Cu(II) was predominantly on the
sorbent surface.38 The actual achievable
sorption capacity of Ca-HC for Cu(II) was found to be 130.57 mg g–1 at 303 K, which was much higher than that of most
biochars (Table 2).

2.4 Sorption Kinetics of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC
Figure 4a shows the
Cu(II) sorption kinetics onto Ca-HC at different temperatures (303–323
K). The Cu(II) sorption increased sharply during the first 120 min,
followed by a slower increase till reaching an sorption equilibria
at about 480 min. Thus, the sorption equilibrium was achieved approximately
within 8 h.

Figure 4 (a) Influence of time on Cu(II) sorption onto Ca-HC; (b) and (c)
kinetic analysis of Cu(II) sorption based on the linear plot of pseudo-second-order
rate equation and pseudo-first-order rate equation; and (d) two-step
intraparticle diffusion model simulation for the sorption of Cu(II)
onto Ca-HC.

To confirm the process of sorption
kinetics and the rate-controlling
steps of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC, the experimental data were simulated by
the pseudo-first-order (eq 4),49 pseudo-second-order (eq 5),50 and intraparticle diffusion models (eq 6).51 The equations involved
in the calculation are as follows 4   5   6  where qe and qt are the quantity of Cu(II)
absorbed by Ca-HC at equilibrium and time t, respectively. k1 (min–1), k2 (g min–1 mg–1),
and kid (mg g–1 min1/2) are the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order
and intraparticle diffusion rate constants, respectively. Besides, C (mg g–1) is proportional to the thickness
of the boundary layer.

Figure 4b,c displays
the linear kinetic sorption of Cu(II) on Ca-HC by the pseudo-first-order
and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. The calculated and R2 values from the kinetic models are shown in Table 3. Table 3 shows that the pseudo-second-order
model might have higher R2 values compared
with those of the pseudo-first-order model. Besides, the experimental qe values (qe,exp) were close to those (qe,cal) calculated
in the pseudo-second-order model. Based on this data analysis, it
was likely that the pseudo-second-order model was in line with the
kinetic process, and this justified the fact that the interaction
with the sorbent and sorbate was chemisorption.50

Pseudo-First-Order and the Pseudo-Second-Order Models Derived from
Linear Regression for Cu(II) Sorption on Ca-HC
 	 	pseudo-first-order model	pseudo-second-order model

323	121.91	43.21	0.01155	0.93542	126.26	4.718 × 10–4	0.99926	
Interestingly, the intraparticle diffusion equation
could describe
the sorption kinetics of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC. The plots of qt versus t1/2 are shown in Figure 4d and the process of sorption was fitted by two straight lines with
high R2.51 The
calculated values are shown in Table S1. The higher slope of the first region originated from the fast sorption
of Cu(II) on the available external surface of Ca-HC. The second region
with a lower slope was controlled by intraparticle diffusion. The
regression linear curves during two stages failed to cross the origin,
which meant that the intraparticle diffusion could not be considered
as the only step to control the rate during the sorption process.52

2.5 Initial pH and Cation Concentrations
on the
Sorption of Cu(II)
The influence of the initial pH value
of Cu(II) solution is presented in Figure 5a. The sorption of Cu(II) increased from
84.45 to 149.97 mg g–1 with the increase of initial
pH value of Cu(II) solution from 3.0 to 6.5. Moreover, the equilibrium
pH values were higher than the initial pH values. As the initial pH
values were low, the low level
of Cu(II) uptake by Ca-HC could be ascribed to the increase of protonation
of these organic functional groups,12 and
thus the ability to form surface complexation between organic functional
groups on the surface of the Ca-HC with Cu(II) decreased. Moreover,
as the initial solution pH decreased, calcite on the surface of Ca-HC
was gradually converted to soluble calcium bicarbone, which remained
as solid in the solution.37 Thus, the contribution
of carbonate of Ca-HC to remove Cu(II) gradually disappeared. It provided
another explanation for the decreased uptake of Cu(II) by Ca-HC at
a lower initial pH.

Figure 5 (a) Effects of pH on the sorption of Cu(II) by Ca-HC.
(b) Effect
of cations on Cu(II) sorption by Ca-HC.

The influence of cations on the relative Cu(II) sorption gave further
insight into the mechanisms of Cu(II) binding by Ca-HC. The values
of qe were little affected by coexisting
cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) (Figure 5b). The results revealed that the cations had negligible influence
on the sorption of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC, and the Cu(II) sorption mechanism
was not governed by any cation-exchange mechanism.

2.6 Study of Sorption Thermodynamics
The enthalpy (ΔH°), entropy (ΔS°), and
Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) values of the
sorption of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC could be derived
by the following equations 7   8  where T is the absolute temperature, R (8.314
J mol–1 K–1) is the universal
gas constant, and KL is the constant of
the Langmuir equilibrium. The values of ΔH°
and ΔS° could be obtained
through the van’t Hoff plots (Figure S3). The calculated parameters are shown in Table 4. The negative values of ΔG° showed that Cu(II) sorption onto Ca-HC was spontaneously and
thermodynamically favorable. The negative values of ΔG° increased as the temperatures increased, which meant
that the sorption was favored at higher temperatures.

Table 4 Thermodynamic Analysis Data of Cu(II)
Sorption by Ca-HC.

303	–21.84	25.49	155.85	0.99619	
313	–23.35	
323	–24.97	
The positive values of ΔH° showed the
endothermic nature of sorption, that is, as the temperature increased,
the capacities of the Cu(II) sorption also increased.53 The positive value of ΔS° indicated
a rise in the randomness at the interface of solid solution in the
Cu(II) sorption process. As a result, the driving force for Cu(II)
onto Ca-HC was due to the enthalpy and entropy effects.

2.7 Sorption Mechanisms of Cu(II) on Ca-HC
To delve on
the removal mechanism of Cu(II), the FTIR spectra of
Ca-HC before and after Cu(II) sorption are shown in Figure 1b. After the Cu(II) sorption,
the asymmetric stretching vibration of carboxylate at 1607 cm–1 was blue-shifted and the symmetric stretching of
the carboxylate group at 1379 cm–1 increased, indicating
that surface complexes possibly occurred between Cu(II) and the carboxylate
group on the Ca-HC surface.30 The intensities
of the carbonate at 1427 and 879 cm–1 clearly decreased
after Cu(II) sorption, indicating that carbonate was involved in the
Cu(II) sorption reaction.36 The band intensity
at 1060 cm–1 increased and new bands appeared at
1112, 793, 603, 515, and 434 cm–1, which could be
attributed to the introduction of new components on the surface of
Ca-HC.37 To further confirm the contribution
of the chemical precipitation in Cu(II) sorption. The Ca-HC before
and after sorption of Cu(II) was analyzed by XRD (Figure 1a). The characterization diffraction
peaks of calcite in the XRD pattern decreased, while a new diffraction
peak of posnjakite appeared, suggesting that calcite played an important
role in Cu(II) sorption. However, the effect of cations on Cu(II)
sorption was negligible (Figure 5b), which confirmed the no cation exchange and electrostatic
interaction occurred between Cu(II) and calcite on the Ca-HC surface.
Based on the XRD and FTIR analysis, it was concluded that the possible
precipitation reaction (eq 1) was proposed for Cu(II) sorption on calcite.

The elemental
analysis showed that the S content increased from 0.58 to 1.41% after
the sorption of Cu(II). This assumption of the increase of S content
came from the precipitate of Cu4(SO4)(OH)6·2H2O. One gram of Cu-HC contained 66.4 mg
of Cu(II) according to elemental analysis, which suggested that precipitation
was an important mechanism driving Cu(II) sorption.

3 Conclusions
Calcite-impregnated hydrochar sorbent was synthesized
by a facile
one-step hydrothermal technique for the removal of Cu(II). The as-prepared
Ca-HC as a dual sorbent has high efficiency of removing Cu(II) from
aqueous solution. The sorption mechanisms were involved in the surface
complexation of Cu(II) by the oxygen-containing functional groups
and precipitation of Cu4(SO4)(OH)6·2H2O from copper sulfate and hydroxide from the
hydrolysis of carbonate. The calcite can increase the sorption capacity
of the hydrochar for Cu(II) and the maximum sorption capacity of Ca-HC
for Cu(II) calculated obtained from the Langmuir model was 138.50
mg g–1 at 303 K. Therefore, this study suggested
a novel strategy to enhance effectiveness of hydrochar as a sorbent
for the removal of Cu(II) from the aqueous solution.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
All chemicals
were of analytical purity and applied as received. Hydrochloric acid,
sodium carbonate, copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, sodium hydroxide,
calcium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate,
and potassium chloride were used as received from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Wood powder (particle size less
than 250 μm) provided by Linan Mingzhu Bamboo and Wood Powder
Co., Ltd as feedstock was used to produce hydrochar.

The stock
solution of copper (1000 mg L–1) was prepared through
the dissolution of 3.9293 g of CuSO4·5H2O in 1000 mL of deionized water and then diluted to appropriate concentrations.

4.2 Preparation of Ca-HC and HC
Forty
grams of dried wood powder (less than 60 mesh), 5.0 g of CaCl2, and 5.0 g of Na2CO3 were mixed with
200 mL of deionized water and stirred for 15 min at room temperature.
Then, the mixture was placed in a 500 mL Teflon autoclave, heated
for 12 h in an electric oven at 200 °C, and cooled down to room
temperature. Afterward, the product was filtered, washed with 1000
mL of deionized water, and dried at 80 °C. The products obtained
before and after the sorption of Cu(II) were denoted as Ca-HC and
Cu-HC, respectively.

The preparation process of wood hydrochar
(HC) was the same as that of Ca-HC except that CaCl2 and
Na2CO3 were not added as reactants.

4.3 Characterizations of Ca-HC and Cu-HC
The concentrations
of Cu(II) after sorption were obtained by a Z-2000
Frame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (HITACHI, Japan). The carbon,
hydrogen, sulfur, and nitrogen contents of hydrochars were determined
by an Elementar Vario ELIII elemental analyzer. Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of hydrochars were carried out using a Spectrum
65 FTIR instrument (PE, America) in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 for 32 scans with the resolution of 4 cm–1 using KBr pellets. The morphological structures of hydrochars were
examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI
Quanta F250). The composition of the elements on the surface of hydrochars
were determined by an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX, Oxford
X-max 80). The phase structures were identified by a Bruker D8 advance
X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (Germany) at a resolution
of 0.02°. The solid phases were identified using Jade 6.5 software.
A AutoPore IV 9500 Hg porosimeter (Micromeritics) was applied to determine
the structural properties. The BET surface area and pore volume were
determined using Micromeritics ASAP 2020.

4.4 Sorption
Experiments
The batch experiments
in this work were executed by adding 40 mg of Ca-HC to 50 mL of Cu(II)
solution in a 150 mL conical flask, and the mixtures were horizontally
shaken on a mechanical shaker (SHY-2A, China) at a speed of 110 rpm
for the predetermined time at the desired temperature. After sorption,
the mixtures were filtered and the residual concentrations of Cu(II)
were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer with the wavelength
of 324.8 nm. The quantity of Cu(II) that was adsorbed onto Ca-HC was
worked out according to eq 9 shown below54,55 9  where Co and Ce (mg L–1) are the initial
and equilibrium concentrations of Cu(II) in solution, respectively. V (mL) is the solution volume. W (mg) is
the weight of Ca-HC. qe (mg g–1) is the amount of Cu(II) adsorbed at equilibrium.

The sorption
isotherms were obtained at different concentrations of Cu(II) solutions
(30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mg L–1)
at the natural pH of solution and the temperatures of 303–323
K for 24 h.

The sorption kinetics of Cu(II) onto Ca-HC were
studied at different
time intervals (30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, and 600 min),
and the concentration of Cu(II) was 120 mg L–1 at
the initial pH and temperatures of 303–323 K.

the influence of pH on the Cu(II) sorption, Cu(II) solution
of 120 mg L–1 was adjusted to varied values (3.0–6.5)
by 0.1 mol L–1 of HCl and NaOH and shaken at 303
K for 24 h.

The effect of cations was studied by adding 40 mg
of Ca-HC to 120
mg L–1 Cu(II) solution containing different concentrations
of NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 (0.0–0.2
mol L–1) at natural pH and 303 K for 24 h.
