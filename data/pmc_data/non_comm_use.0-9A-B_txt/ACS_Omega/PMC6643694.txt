The
widely varied compositions and structures of plant cuticles
create problems in the identification of suitable model systems for
laboratory testing of adjuvants. We have compared the behavior of
an extracted cuticle wax with tristearin, a well characterized crystalline
triglyceride, which we propose as a model cuticle for ranking new
adjuvant systems for their propensity to disrupt the cuticle barrier.
The interaction of adjuvant products and their components with the
extracted cuticle wax and tristearin was determined using differential
scanning calorimetry and small angle X-ray scattering approaches.
The interaction of the additive with tristearin caused a concentration-dependent
change in the crystallite level, and correlated between the extracted
wax and tristearin. Tristearin was subsequently used to compare the
effectiveness of a range of adjuvant products and their major components.
This approach has utility to quantify the effects of adjuvant components
and enable more judicious selection of adjuvant candidates to progress
to plant trials.

==== Body
Introduction
Agrochemical adjuvants
are commonly used in crop application of
pesticides to promote increased bioavailability of the pesticide by
improved foliar uptake.1 The effect of
adjuvants on the foliar uptake of pesticides occurs by two main mechanisms,
namely, control over the physicochemical properties of the applied
product such as the droplet size and spreading1,2 and/or
control over the interaction of pesticide with the target crop surface.3 Both uptake mechanisms are aided by the use of
an adjuvant, generally consisting of an oil/surfactant mixture.1b The adjuvant oil is usually based on either
hydrocarbon or vegetable oil sources with nonionic surfactants, by
far the most commonly used surfactant type.4 Other adjuvant systems exist which contain a number of different
materials, but these serve more specific purposes such as improved
rainfastness,5 improved delivery efficiency,5,6 as well as reduced environmental toxicity.5,7

Adjuvants act upon the cuticle of the leaf of the plant and improve
the delivery of the active ingredient through softening of the epicuticular
wax layer,8 the outer barrier layer of
the leaf. The epicuticular wax layer is a complex matrix of waxes
which consists of long chain (>C20) alcohols, esters, and acids.9 Plant species have different epicuticular wax
profiles which creates complexity in the comparison of efficacy between
the adjuvant systems and in determining the contributions of components
used within adjuvants. The use of model compounds and mixtures to
mimic the crystalline epicuticular matrix has been studied and show
excellent insights into the structure and behavior of plant cuticles.10 The ability to develop a method which allows
comparison of the major components of an adjuvant system with that
of the actual product would be an extremely useful tool in the development
of new and novel adjuvant systems.

We propose the use of tristearin
(glyceryl tristearate) as a model
cuticle due to multiple potential advantages. Firstly, tristearin
is a naturally occurring triglyceride and is readily available in
high purity. Secondly, the crystalline behavior of tristearin is well
characterized and has three major crystallite forms with the two most
prominent being the kinetically stable α-crystallite and the
thermodynamically stable β-crystallite.11 The interaction of additives/components/impurities with the α-form
of tristearin causes a change in crystallization behavior of the α-crystallite,
due to disruption of the packing, leading to a loss in the level of
crystallite material present. Thus, the effectiveness of the disruption
by the additive is indicative of the more aggressive adjuvancy of
the adjuvant mixture or the isolated component.12 Several studies have used different long chain waxes as
an in vitro cuticle model10 but not as
a method for the high-throughput screening for the quantification
and greater understanding of the efficacy of different adjuvant components.

The aim of the first part of this study was to determine whether
tristearin is a suitable model cuticle in comparison with the extracted
cuticle wax.10b,13Ficus macrophylla was selected as the nominal source for the cuticle wax as the tree
is evergreen, readily available in suitable quantities required for
extraction, and the cuticle of other members of the moraceae family
have been readily studied.14 The second
aspect of this study was the use of tristearin films to rank the likely
trends in efficacy of different adjuvant types (fatty acid ester and
mineral oil-based adjuvants) and their major components. The effect
of the adjuvants on the tristearin and extracted wax substitutes was
studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS). The structures of tristearin and the major
components of selected adjuvants and the components from which they
are prepared are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of significant components of systems
studied: 1, tristearin; 2, generalized structure
for mineral
oil (where n is typically >20); 3, oleate
ester, where R = methyl or ethyl; 4, typical example
of a phospholipid present in lecithin.

Materials and Methods
Tristearin (glycerol tristearate)
(Figure 1) was purchased
from Tokyo Chemical Industry
(Tokyo, Japan). The adjuvant Hasten (alkyl ester adjuvant), whose major components are a mixture
of canola oil methyl and ethyl esters 3 (Figure 1), was used as supplied by
Victorian Chemicals (Coolaroo, VIC, Australia). Inbound (Mineral oil
adjuvant 1 (MO1)) and Empower (Mineral oil adjuvant 2 (MO2)) are mineral oil-based adjuvants
based on Mineral Oil SN70 and Mineral Oil 150 2 (Figure 1), respectively,
and were used as supplied by Victorian Chemicals (Coolaroo, VIC, Australia).
Liberate (lecithin adjuvant) is an adjuvant based on soy lecithin 4 and alkyl methyl esters 3 (Figure 1) and was also used as supplied
by Victorian Chemicals (Coolaroo, VIC, Australia). Differential scanning
calorimetry pans and lids were purchased from Perkin Elmer (Glen Waverley,
VIC, Australia). Microscope coverslips were purchased from VWR International
(Tingalpa, QLD, Australia). 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane (>98%
purity), silica gel (Kieselgel 40), methyl oleate (99% purity GC standard),
and ethyl oleate (98% purity GC standard) were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ
resistivity at 25 °C) was from a Milli-Q Academic water purification
system from Millipore (Sydney, NSW, Australia).

Extraction of Leaf Cuticle
Wax
Nontarnished leaves of multiple trees of Ficus macrophylla were freshly picked (1.0 kg) and
placed in a large beaker (10 L).
Chloroform (2 L) was added to the mixture and agitated to allow the
solvent to coat all leaves. After 1 min, the solvent was decanted
into a second beaker (5 L), to which magnesium sulfate was added.
Filtration of the magnesium sulfate, followed by removal of the solvent
by using a rotary evaporator (40 °C, 200 mbar) yielded a dark
brown oil (2.84 g), which solidified upon cooling. The extract was
taken up in chloroform (15 mL) and passed through silica gel (75 mL)
using gradient elution with chloroform (4 × 100 mL) followed
by 96:4 chloroform/methanol (2 × 100 mL). Removal of the solvent
again by using a rotary evaporator (40 °C, 200 mbar) yielded
a brown oil, which solidified upon cooling to form a creamy solid
(1.9 g), in a yield of 0.2%, based upon the mass of leaves extracted.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
All DSC samples were
run on a DSC8500 from Perkin Elmer (Glen Waverley,
VIC, Australia). For DSC measurements, two different sample preparation
approaches were used to investigate the interaction of the adjuvant
with tristearin – premixing the adjuvant/component with tristearin
prior to casting the film in the DSC pan or the addition of the adjuvant
system to the precast tristearin film.

Preparation of Samples
– Premixing Adjuvant/Component
with Tristearin before Casting of the Film
All premix samples
were prepared by the same method. A typical example is described here
for the premixed 2.5% ethyl oleate sample. Ethyl oleate (5.4 mg) and
tristearin (180 mg) were weighed into a vial (4 mL) and to this 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane
(1 mL) was added. The mixture was vortex mixed (30 s) and placed in
an oven (37 °C) to allow complete dissolution. The vial was removed
from the oven and an aliquot was immediately removed by an Eppendorf
pipette (20 μL), to which the sample was carefully added to
a DSC pan (aluminum, 50 μL) in a separate oven (85 °C).
The solution was then left for 30 min at 85 °C to allow complete
evaporation of the solvent. The DSC pan was removed from the oven
and placed on a metal plate, at 20 °C, to aid the formation of
the rapidly cooled tristearin film. A lid was sealed onto the sample
pan with a Perkin Elmer universal crimper press. The DSC sample was
held isothermally at 30 °C for 1 min, before heating at a ramp
rate of 5 °C/min, to 75 °C. The peak area of the α-crystallite
peak was recorded as the area under the graph from 45 °C to the
point tangent to the baseline intersected the DSC trace.

Preparation
of Samples – Surface Application of the Adjuvant
to Premade Tristearin-Only Films
All surface-applied samples
were prepared by the same method. A typical example is described for
the 2.5% alkyl ester adjuvant system. The adjuvant-free tristearin
(180 mg) was weighed into a vial (4 mL) and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane
(1 mL) added, and the crystalline film was prepared as described above.
Then the alkyl ester adjuvant (10 mg) was added to Milli-Q water (4
mL) and roll-mixed for 30 min. An aliquot (40 μL) was added
to the DSC pan which contained the crystalline tristearin film, and
was then placed in an oven (40 °C) for 60 min to dry. The sample
was removed from the oven and a lid was sealed with the sample pan
with a Perkin Elmer universal crimper press. The DSC sample was held
isothermally at 30 °C for 1 min before heating at a ramp rate
of 5 °C/min to 75 °C. The peak area of the α-crystallite
peak was recorded as the area under the graph from 45 °C to the
point tangent to the baseline intersected the DSC trace.

Small Angle
X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
Preparation of Samples
– Premixing Adjuvant/Component
with Tristearin
All premix samples were prepared by the same
method. The glass cover slip (20 mm × 20 mm) was cleaned by a
sequential wash process, in which the slide was immersed in chloroform,
then ethanol, then water, followed by ethanol and finally chloroform
before air drying. The glass slide was then placed in an oven (85
°C) on a metallic shelf for improved heat conduction. A typical
example is for the 2.5% ethyl oleate premixed system. Ethyl oleate
(6.0 mg) and tristearin (240 mg) were weighed into a vial (4 mL) and
to this, chloroform (2 mL) was added. The mixture was vortex mixed
(30 s) and left to stand (10 min) to allow complete dissolution. An
aliquot was removed by an Eppendorf pipette (250 μL) and carefully
added onto the glass slide to prevent loss of any of the solution.
The slide was left for 5 min at 85 °C to allow complete evaporation
of the solvent. The glass slide was removed from the oven and immediately
placed on a metal plate at 20 °C to aid the formation of the
tristearin film. The glass slide was stored in a plastic container
to prevent dust contamination until SAXS measurements.

SAXS Acquisition
and Analysis
The SAXS/WAXS beamline
at the Australian Synchrotron, Clayton, Australia,15 was used to detect the crystallite structure of tristearin
present in a sample and the change in the crystallite intensity with
increased adjuvant or adjuvant component. Adjuvant/tristearin-coated
glass slides were mounted on a steel 40 well plate (126 mm ×
78 mm) with the center of each glass slide coinciding with the machined
hole through the plate to allow the X-ray beam to pass through the
sample. Twelve samples were mounted on each plate. SAXS data were
collected for 1 s with a Pilatus 1 M camera (active area 169 ×
179 mm2 with a pixel size of 172 × 172 μm2), and a sample to detector distance of 1532 mm. The acquired
synchrotron SAXS patterns were integrated from 2D scatter patterns
to a one-dimensional intensity of scattering function (I(q)) vs the scattering vector (q) using the Scatterbrain software package, developed at the Australian
Synchrotron. The length of the scattering vector is defined by the
equation q = (4π/λ)sin (2θ/2),
where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength
of the X-rays (0.661 Å). Deconvolution of the diffractograms
to determine the levels of α and β-crystallites of tristearin
was conducted using eXPFit, an add-in for Microsoft Office Excel,
designed by Dr. Roger Nix of the University of London.

Results
and Discussion
Correlation of Thermal Behavior between Macrophylla
Extract
and Tristearin
Comparison of the thermal behavior of the
extracted Ficus macrophylla cuticle
wax and tristearin in the presence of alkyl ester adjuvant was undertaken
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the ability
of tristearin to act as a model cuticle in these measurements.

The extracted cuticle wax from Ficus macrophylla is a mixture of different lipids, and presents a broad melt profile
with multiple melt maxima (Figure 2). The onset of the overall melt transition appeared
at 53.27 ± 1.99 °C (n = 15) with the enthalpy
of melt transition of 38.30 ± 7.81 J/g. In comparison to the
extract, tristearin showed three clear thermal transitions. First
is the melt transition for the α-crystallite peak, second, the
subsequent crystallization of the β-form, and finally, the peak
of the melt transition of the β-form. The α-crystallite
form of tristearin had a melt temperature (onset) at 53.40 ±
0.37 °C, (n = 20) and the melt transition showed
an enthalpy of 84.45 ± 4.89 J/g, both of which matched literature
values for tristearin.11a The two wax systems
therefore showed very similar onset melt temperatures, even with different
melt transition profiles. The plant wax has a significantly lower
enthalpy of transition which can be attributed to the plant cuticle
wax extract being more amorphous due to the complex composition, and
thus presenting a lower level of wax crystallites.

Figure 2 Representative DSC traces
of tristearin (bottom) and cuticle wax
extracted from Ficus macrophylla (top).

Comparison of the effect of adjuvant
on the two wax systems was
undertaken by the preparation of a series of samples in triplicate,
which contained increasing levels of the premixed adjuvant. The effect
of the addition of alkyl ester adjuvant, added to both tristearin
and cuticle wax at levels of 0–4 and 0–15% w/w as an
example of the results from the DSC studies, are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 DSC traces of Ficus macrophylla cuticle
wax (A) and tristearin (B) premixed with increasing amounts of alkyl
ester adjuvant, in % w/w. Curves are offset for clarity.

As the level of additive in the cuticle extract
was increased,
a systematic decrease was observed in both the melt onset peak, from
54 to 48 °C and in the peak area (Figure 3A). The change in the peak area is obscured
visually due to a shift in the baseline, but the trend, when converted
to change in area as shown in Figure 4 is clear. Both of these effects are related to the
cuticle wax being a mixture of different materials, all of which contribute
to the melt transition. Some of these components will have a higher
or lower sensitivity to the presence of the additive. A similar pattern
was observed for all additives studied which involve the extracted Ficus macrophylla cuticle wax. Although this complex
composition reduced the resolution of the transitions compared to
tristearin, there are sufficient systematic changes in the thermal
transition using this extract to provide direct comparison with the
systems exposed to tristearin.

additives (% w/w) in
the extracted cuticle wax (top four panels), and tristearin (bottom
four panels). Data are mean ± sd, n = 3. (A,
E) Alkyl ester adjuvant; (B, F) MO1 adjuvant; (C, G) MO2 adjuvant;
(D, H) Lecithin adjuvant.

As the level of alkyl ester adjuvant was increased in the
tristearin
film, the formation of the α-crystallite peak was suppressed
and a marked change in the α-crystallite peak shape occurred.
At low levels of additive, only small changes in the onset melt temperature
and peak area occurred. Above 0.5% w/w alkyl ester adjuvant levels,
the onset melt temperature and peak area deceased substantially. The
α-crystallite peak completely disappeared upon the addition
of 4% w/w of the alkyl ester adjuvant. As the enthalpy of the α-crystallite
decreased, the onset temperature of the melt transition also decreased
and the peak shape broadened due to increased disruption of the crystalline
matrix of tristearin.

The most significant difference between
the two wax systems was
that even when high loadings of the adjuvant were added to the cuticle
wax, there was a proportion of the melt transition that was not influenced
by the presence of adjuvant. This was not the case with tristearin,
when even at low levels of additive, there was a complete suppression
of the melt transition under study. The changes in the peak area for
all the additives studied are more clearly observed when the area
of the melt transitions is plotted against the additive concentration
(Figure 4). The peak
area of the melt transition relates to the level of crystallites formed
when the film is crystallized and is dependent upon both the nature
and the level of the additive present. This gives an accurate and
reproducible comparison for the study of the effect of additives on
the wax matrix system.

Effectiveness of Different Adjuvants on Extracted
Cuticle Wax
The addition of alkyl ester adjuvants to the
extracted cuticle
wax induced a significant change in enthalpy at low alkyl ester adjuvant
levels (Figure 4A).
The addition of alkyl ester adjuvant induced a reduction in the crystallite
peak area of 12% at only 2.5% w/w adjuvant, which reduced to 55% at
7.5% w/w alkyl ester adjuvant. At levels of addition of alkyl ester
adjuvant above 7.5% w/w a plateau occurred, indicating a limit of
the effect of the adjuvant on the cuticle wax extract. The MO1 adjuvant
(Figure 4B) behaved
in a slightly different manner from that of the alkyl ester adjuvant,
with a greater interaction at lower additive levels. There was a 19%
reduction in the peak area at 2.5% w/w additive level but a reduced
interaction at higher levels. Slightly greater than 10% w/w additive
was required to achieve a 51% loss in the peak area. At this point,
a limit was reached, where the adjuvant system was effective at suppression
of the cuticle wax crystallites. The MO2 adjuvant required greater
additive levels of 15% w/w to achieve the maximum suppression of the
cuticle wax (Figure 4C), but unlike the previously discussed adjuvants, the level at which
the suppression of the wax crystallites occurred was significantly
lower, at 72% loss of melt transition. This difference may be due
to the fact that the MO2 adjuvant has a much lower surfactant content
than the alkyl ester adjuvant or the MO1 adjuvant. The phospholipid
mixture lecithin (Figure 4D) adjuvant was by far the least effective adjuvant system
studied, in which a 2.5% w/w loading caused only an 8% suppression
of the peak area and required over 15% w/w lecithin adjuvant to achieve
the maximum extent of interaction with the wax.

Effectiveness
of Different Adjuvants on Tristearin
The profiles for adjuvant
effectiveness against tristearin in Figure 4E–H are visually
similar to those for the extracted wax appearing as sigmoidal type
dose–response curves, except that they demonstrated complete
elimination of α-crystallites with the sufficient addition of
adjuvant, making the enthalpy reach baseline levels. It is apparent
visually that the alkyl ester induced the greatest change at lower
adjuvant concentrations than the two MO adjuvants, which in turn were
much more effective than the lecithin system.

Comparison
of Trend in Effectiveness of Adjuvants between Waxes
Using Half-Maximal Effective Concentration
The trend in effectiveness
of the different adjuvants against the crystallites in the extracted
cuticle wax is more easily compared quantitatively when plotted as
the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50). This index
can then be used as a measure of the additive potency towards the
crystalline material and is analogous to the measurement of drug potency.16 The significant advantage of the use of the
EC50 methodology is the direct comparison of effectiveness
between different adjuvants obtained for either wax system, and direct
visual comparison of the trends between them. The EC50 was
calculated with the GraphPad Prism 7 graphical software, with the
use of an asymmetric sigmoidal analysis function, on each of the triplicate
series for both wax systems, for each of the adjuvants tested. An
average value of the EC50 was calculated from the individual
values obtained and shown in Figure 5. There is a ranking of effectiveness apparent from
the EC50 values for the cuticle extract.

Figure 5 Comparison of the additive
effect on different wax systems by EC50 methodology.

As can be observed, the trends
of the EC50 values of
additives for both the extracted cuticle wax and tristearin, the proposed
cuticle wax mimic, are very similar. The alkyl ester-based adjuvant
had the lowest EC50 value for both the extracted cuticle
wax and tristearin. The mineral oil-based adjuvants both show the
same trends, that is, the MO1 adjuvant was overall more effective
than MO2 at the suppression of the crystallites in both systems. Finally,
the least effective adjuvant, for both systems, with the highest EC50 value, was the lecithin-based adjuvant. There was a greater
error associated with the measurements based on the extracted cuticle
wax data compared to that of the proposed cuticle model wax, tristearin.
This is most likely due to the extracted cuticle wax being a mixture
of different compounds, potentially including nonwax components of
the leaf, which leads to a weaker, more inconsistent crystallization
compared to that of the single component, model compound, tristearin.
However, this highlights the first major point of the manuscript that
although it may be difficult to obtain reproducible quantitative results
across different adjuvant systems in the real extracted cuticle wax,
tristearin serves as a more controlled comparator, where the trends
in effectiveness are preserved, providing confidence that tristearin
is indeed a suitable model for use in further studies. Extracted waxes
are inherently variable depending on the season, environmental conditions,
nutrient source, etc., and proving that its composition quantitatively
is impossible, whereas tristearin can provide the same ranking of
formulation adjuvants without this inherent variability.

The
alkyl ester adjuvant was the most effective product for both
the extracted cuticle wax and the proposed cuticle mimic which could
be ascribed to increased incorporation into the crystalline matrix.17 In the premixed format used in this first part
of the manuscript, incorporation into the crystalline matrix during
the initial crystallization would be a prerequisite to subsequent
impact on the level of crystallites present. The structure of the
alkyl ester would interact more avidly with the alkyl ester chains
of the triglyceride. Mineral oils would be expected to exhibit a reduced
interaction with both the extracted cuticle wax and tristearin when
the film is crystallized, due to poorer molecular compatibility with
the triglycerides in the crystal matrix. Their exclusion from the
tristearin crystal matrix would then necessitate a greater level of
material to be present to affect the disruption of the crystallites
present within the film. The difference between the effectiveness
of the two mineral oil-based adjuvants may be a function of packing
of the different distribution of chain lengths into the crystalline
matrix lattice. Alternatively it may be due to the consequent differences
in viscosity of the two products, which are based upon oils with different
molecular weight fractions, as increased viscosity has been shown
to reduce inclusion levels of impurities within crystal structures.12 The lecithin-based product shows the least interaction
with the two wax systems, which may be due to the fact that it contains
much more polar and charged species compared to the other adjuvants.
This would be expected to further reduce the incorporation within
the crystal matrices, thus requiring a significantly increased level
to disrupt the crystallite matrix.

One significant difference
between the interactions of the additives
with the two wax systems studied was that the cuticle wax extracted
from Ficus macrophylla showed only
a partial interaction with the adjuvant products, in that a maximum
of only about 60% of the crystallites were suppressed by the addition
of adjuvant products, compared to complete suppression in the proposed
cuticle model, tristearin. This may be due to the extraction of materials
from the Ficus macrophylla leaves which
have a melting point within the range studied (35–80 °C)
but have no interaction with adjuvant products studied. However, the
correlation of effectiveness with the adjuvant type against the two
wax systems indicates that the extracted solutes that do interact
with the adjuvant are representative of cuticle waxes.

Confirmation
of Structural Changes in Tristearin To Corroborate
DSC as a High-Throughput Screening Method for Adjuvants
The
thermal behavior of tristearin is well established from previous DSC-based
studies allowing the determination of changes in α-crystallite
formation.11a,11c However, DSC is still a nonspecific
technique, where any heat transfer will induce a signal. In comparison,
diffraction measurements provide confirmatory direct and definitive
proof of changes in phase transitions through the direct measurement
of the structure. Small angle X-ray scattering, when coupled with
a synchrotron X-ray source, provides high quality rapid diffraction
data to correlate with the DSC data. Premixed samples were prepared
similarly to those of the DSC samples but on glass microscope coverslips
and the diffraction was measured using SAXS.

A representative
example of the SAXS patterns obtained from transmission experiments
on the films are shown in Figure 6, where ethyl oleate, a component of adjuvant systems,
was the additive premixed with tristearin.

Figure 6 Effect of premixing increasing
amounts of ethyl oleate with tristearin
on diffraction of X-rays by tristearin films. Curves are offset for
clarity and % is w/w.

The diffractogram of tristearin alone shows a clear diffraction
peak at q = 0.124 Å–1, which
corresponds to the α-form of tristearin (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for full tristearin
diffractogram).11b,18 The addition of ethyl oleate
as an additive induced a slight broadening of the diffraction pattern,
but no change in the level of α-crystallite of tristearin occurred
below 1% ethyl oleate. Above 1%, the appearance of a small peak at q = 0.140 Å, which corresponds to the β-crystallite
of tristearin, was apparent.11b,18 With the increased
addition of ethyl oleate additive, the α-crystallite peak decreased
further in intensity, replaced by the β-crystallite. At 3% (w/w)
ethyl oleate and above, no α-crystallite remained and only the
β-crystallite of tristearin was present.

Reduction in
the level of α-crystallite of tristearin upon
increased amount of ethyl oleate was calculated for both DSC and SAXS
data sets (Figure 7A), expressed as the EC50 value (Figure 7B). Determination of the SAXS data were run
in triplicate and, where required, deconvolution of the peaks was
conducted using the eXPFIT macro, designed for the use with Microsoft
Excel.19

Figure 7 (A) Comparison of the effect of increasing
ethyl oleate concentration
on the level of α-crystallite formed by tristearin using DSC
and SAXS. (B) EC50 values determined from DSC and SAXS
data. Data are mean ± sd, n = 3.

The SAXS data set is similar to that of the DSC
data set for the
use of ethyl oleate as an additive, in that they both show sigmoidal
responses to the inclusion of the additive. The EC50 value
of the effect of ethyl oleate on tristearin was calculated to be 1.48%
by DSC and 1.84% by SAXS. The overall slightly higher EC50 values obtained from SAXS measurements is ascribed to the lower
temperature at which SAXS measurements were conducted (room temperature).
In contrast, the DSC measurement of the intensity of the α-peak
essentially begins at 45 °C, at which point the system will be
more fluid. So, although both techniques are probing the level of
disruption of the tristearin films, they are conducted under very
different conditions. The close concordance between the two techniques
provides further confidence in DSC as a strong representative ranking
approach for comparing effectiveness across adjuvants or components
of adjuvant systems. Additional supporting examples of these correlations
are provided in Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information.

Comparison of Major Components with Complete
Adjuvant Products
Using the methodology described in the
earlier sections, calculation
of EC50 values for the complete adjuvant products, compared
to the major component from which they are composed can be made (Figure 8). The raw data providing
the EC50 values are illustrated in Figures S3–S5 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 8 Comparison
of effectiveness of adjuvant products with their major
components, determined by the DSC and SAXS methodologies.

The lecithin adjuvant product, which contained
a mixture of soy
lecithin and alkyl oleate esters as the main components, showed behavior
that fell between that of the two components, indicating that methyl
oleate is required to boost the poor performance of lecithin, but
is not synergistic in its combination. In contrast, the mineral and
vegetable oil components (ethyl and methyl oleate) were more effective
than the corresponding complete adjuvant product. This suggests that
the oil component of the adjuvant product is more able to disrupt
the model cuticle film than the complete adjuvant system. It is acknowledged
that the commercial products may also contain minor amounts of particularly
surface-active components that may provide a large effect on cuticle
disruption; the methods demonstrated here provide a means to more
rapidly isolate and compare their individual contributions to the
overall product formulations.

Comparison of the Effectiveness
of Adjuvant Systems on Surface
Application
The studies shown above were performed by premixing
the extracted cuticle wax or tristearin with the system of interest.
Although demonstrated to give useful trending information, the use
of the model cuticle for the study of adjuvants and their components
are of greater values if they correlate with real world application
conditions. The conventional application of adjuvant products is through
spray deposition onto the leaf surface of the crop with subsequent
drying of the deposited droplets on the leaf surface through environmental
exposure.20 To that end, the application
of the adjuvant products to a film of tristearin with subsequent drying
was also undertaken to allow comparison of the premix and surface-applied
methodologies. The study of the aqueous application of the individual
components was not possible as homogeneous systems could not be formed
due to immiscibility of the oils with water, consequently the aqueous
surface application studies were limited to the complete adjuvant
products.

The application of aqueous emulsions of the adjuvant
products were undertaken with care to ensure that the complete film
of tristearin was covered by a thin layer of emulsion. The samples
were dried at 40 °C to ensure that no polymorphic change to the
tristearin film occurred due to the drying process. The samples were
run in triplicate by DSC with the change in peak area of the α-crystallite
form of tristearin measured and expressed as the average EC50 value. As the data was asymmetric, this was calculated with the
GraphPad Prism 6 graphical software using asymmetric sigmoidal analysis.
Comparison of the effectiveness of the adjuvant product emulsions
when premixed with tristearin (data repeated from Figure 7), to that when applied to
precast tristearin films is shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Comparison of the relative effectiveness of
the premix and surface
application of adjuvant products to a precast tristearin film measured
by DSC. Data are mean ± sd, n = 3.

There are similar trends observed between the premixed
approach
and surface-applied approach. First, the alkyl ester adjuvant product
had the lowest EC50 of the products using both application
methods. Secondly, the mineral oil-based products showed the same
pattern of effectiveness, in that the MO1 adjuvant showed the lowest
EC50 of the mineral oil-based adjuvants and MO2 adjuvant
the least effective.

Notably the scale of the difference between
the performance of
the two mineral oil adjuvant products was significantly greater using
the surface-applied methodology, even though the same pattern of effectiveness
was observed. For the premix approach, all the components are evenly
distributed through the tristearin, providing a means of maximum interaction.
The effectiveness of adjuvants using the surface-applied methodology
might be expected to be much more dependent on the surfactant component,
as the penetration of the tristearin layer has to occur before disruption
of the tristearin crystallites can occur, mimicking the real-life
process of foliar interaction of adjuvants and pesticides. The mineral
oil adjuvant MO2 has a much lower surfactant content than MO1, and
as such may have compromised ability to wet the tristearin film as
a prerequisite to penetration.

The lecithin-based adjuvant performed
surprisingly well in the
surface-applied format, as the surface activity of the phospholipid
component likely acts similarly to surfactants in providing a wetting
function and enabling penetration of the methyl oleate into the film
to exert its effect on the crystallites. In the premix format, lecithin
cannot serve this function, thus, it appears that the nature of the
oil component needs to be considered in deciding the approach to use
these high-throughput approaches for ranking adjuvant effectiveness
as a route to more judicious choice of formulations for plant trials.

In conclusion, the use of tristearin as a model cuticle system
for the high-throughput screening of performance-relevant differences
between adjuvants and adjuvant components was demonstrated. Both differential
scanning calorimetry and small angle X-ray scattering provided concordant
ranking of effectiveness, indicating that DSC as a laboratory-based
approach is suitable for this purpose. The studies do not inform other
important factors dictating overall field performance of adjuvant
systems including the droplet size, spray cone dimensions, potential
for drift, and soil wetting behavior. However, this methodology assesses
the important adjuvant behavior at the major barrier at the plant
level, and thereby enables valuable insight into the factors for selection
of likely new adjuvant candidates to progress into more expensive
plant-based screening methods.
