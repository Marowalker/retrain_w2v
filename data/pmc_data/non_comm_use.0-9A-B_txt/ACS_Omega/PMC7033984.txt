In this work, we
propose using periodic Au nanoparticles (NPs)
in indium selenide-based optoelectronic devices to tune the optical
absorption of indium selenide. Electromagnetic simulations show that
optical absorption of indium selenide can be manipulated by tuning
plasmonic resonance. The effect on the plasmonic resonance of the
size, period of NPs, the thickness of silicon oxide, and the insulator
spacer is systematically analyzed. A high absorption enhancement over
the visible spectrum is achieved through systematic optimization of
nanostructures.

1 Introduction
After the successful exfoliation
of graphene, two-dimensional (2D)
layered materials have attracted huge attention in the past decades,
which exhibits excellent carrier transport because of its unique 2D
energy dispersion.1−3 Graphene shows high responsivity in photodetectors
and photovoltaics; however, the dark current is high as a result of
the disappearance of the band gap.4−6 In addition, transition-metal
dichalcogenides also exhibit novel optical properties such as MoS2.7 However, the band gap of MoS2 is 1.8 eV, which limits its application in photovoltaic solar
cells and near-infrared photodetectors. Indium selenide (InSe), one
of the members in the family of the layered metal chalcogenide semiconductors,
is considered to be a potential 2D material for the future Si-based
optoelectronic devices.8−11 InSe has its unique characteristics. Compared with MoS2, the direct band gap of bulk InSe is narrower (Eg ≈ 1.3 eV). Nevertheless, InSe covers the solar
spectrum well, providing a wider spectral response.12 From the monolayer to the bulk, the band gaps show a dramatic
change because of the strong interlayer interaction of InSe.13 The band gap of the InSe bulk material is stable
and moderate, and layered InSe undergoes a band gap transition process
from indirect to direct, which makes it have extraordinary application
prospects in the field of photoelectric detection.14 In addition, the InSe ridge offers a new platform for photovoltaic
applications or wide band spectrum photodetectors, making tunable
optoelectronic devices overlap well in the near-infrared regime. A
band gap tuning window as large as ∼1.1 eV in 2D InSe has been
predicted by first principles calculations, and experimentally, it
has been proved that in 5 nm thick InSe nanosheets, the optical band
gap exhibits a 0.2 eV blue shift.15 InSe
becomes a competitive material for the applications in electronics
and optoelectronics because of the high carrier mobility, ambient
stability, and layer-tunable band gap.16−20

Generally, optoelectronic devices with high
performance need two
factors, electron mobility and efficient light absorption.21−24 On the one hand, high electron mobility is desired to separate the
electron–hole pairs in time. It has been proposed that the
multilayer InSe field-effect transistors on the SiO2/Si
substrate can obtain a high mobility of 162 cm2 V–1 s–1 at a certain thickness.25 By utilizing poly(methyl methacrylate)/Al2O3 as the dielectric layer instead of SiO2, the electron
mobility can be further increased up to 1055 cm2 V–1 s–1 because carrier scattering
is significantly reduced by polar phonon scattering and surface-charged
impurities.26 On the other hand, efficient
absorption should be obtained to generate enough electron–hole
pairs. However, the optical absorption of InSe with a limited thickness
of 30 nm is intrinsically poor, which results in low photoresponsivity.
For the electric field polarized perpendicular to the layer plane,
the dipolar selection rules of 2D InSe favor optical transitions to
occur, which leads to a powerful in-plane/out-of-plane anisotropy
of the optical properties.15 Under normal
incidence of a plane wave, the optical absorption of InSe is low for
electric fields with in-plane polarization, especially with limited
thickness. A way to increase the optical absorption is to combine
plasmonic nanostructures based on noble metals with InSe, and the
responsivity of the visible spectrum is tunable through utilizing
the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles
(NPs).27 Plasmonic nanoantennas based on
noble NPs can promote the performance of InSe-based optoelectronic
devices because of near-field excitation and hot electron contribution.
Photovoltage and photocurrent in InSe-based devices display powerful
responsivity enhancement with the application of NP arrays.28 Despite initial experimental studies, it should
be noted that systematic modeling of the nanostructure-based InSe
photodetectors has not been studied at present, to achieve high absorption
enhancement and spectral selectivity.

In this paper, we systematically
reveal the plasmonic effects of
gold NP array nanostructures on the InSe layer. The light absorption
of the InSe layer is manipulated by tuning the plasmonic resonance
of Au nanoantennas. Our research demonstrates that plasmonic resonance
can be controlled to generate alternative optical absorption enhancement,
originating from the light concentration of LSPR and the electromagnetic
coupling between gold nanoantennas and InSe.

2 Results
and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, the periodic gold NPs are cylinders with
a diameter of D and height h, which
are attached to InSe
on a SiO2/Si substrate. The refractive index of silicon
oxide is n = 1.46 and the thickness of silicon oxide,
the period of NP arrays and the thickness of the inserted silicon
oxide are defined as t, p, and t1, respectively. The optical constants of simulated
gold NPs, InSe, and silicon in the structure are taken from the obtained
experimental values proposed in the literatures,29,30 and the out-of-plane absorption of InSe is not taken into consideration,
which means that InSe is assumed to be isotropic, so as all other
refractive media. Here, the influences of heat disturbance and saturable
absorption in InSe are ignored. The finite-difference-time-domain
approach is used with perfectly matched layers as the optical open
boundary conditions to explore the optical absorption of InSe by electromagnetic
simulation. The discretization of space adopts 0.05 times of the metallic
structure’s size in x, y,
and z directions, which was verified to offer convergence
of the simulated results with no loss in physical detail. We only
consider the normally incident plane electromagnetic wave with x-polarization.

view of the proposed
InSe-based optoelectronic device.

2.1 Size and Period of Au NPs
To accurately
estimate the absorption enhancement, we first simulate the optical
absorption of InSe flakes on SiO2/Si as a reference, as
shown in Figure 2a.
It can be found that the absorption of InSe is quite low from 600
to 950 nm, less than 10%, while the absorption of 400–600 nm
is relatively higher. As seen in Figure 2b–d, the optical absorption enhancement
spectra cover the entire spectral range, with different physical mechanisms
in different bands. The localized surface plasmons of the metal act
on the optical absorption in the long wavelengths, with the electric
field localized in the InSe layer, thereby increasing optical absorption.
Also, in the 400–700 nm wavelength region, the reflectance
of the surface is reduced because of the Mie scattering effect of
the metal NPs, thus increasing the absorption of InSe. In this regard,
we investigate plasmonic resonance for absorption enhancement of InSe,
particularly in the long wavelengths. Substrate effects, particle
size, environmental dielectric media, and electromagnetic coupling
between periodic particles can greatly influence the plasmonic resonance
of gold NP arrays. The electron plasma oscillations (particle plasmons)
in single metal NPs have great impact on the optical extinction spectrum
in the visible range. The light absorption of InSe can be governed
by the above factors through tuning the plasmonic resonance. First,
the influences of the array period p and diameter D on the optical absorption enhancement in the InSe layer
are investigated. Meaningful variations of the width and position
of the particle-plasmon resonance were demonstrated, which could be
attributed to in-phase superposition of scattered light from neighboring
particles.31 When NP sizes and array periods
are altered, the frequency of the plasmonic resonance peak could be
manipulated, thus tuning the optical absorption of InSe, as shown
in Figure 2b–d.
Despite tuning the plasmonic resonance, NPs also can enhance optical
absorption as optical scatters. According to Mie scattering theory,
the scattering efficiency is high when the size of the scatter is
on the order of the light wavelength. Hence, p is
fixed at 500 nm as shown in Figure 2b, and the diameter D is changed from
40 to 200 nm. As the absorption is quite low in the long wavelengths,
the absorption enhancement spectra, with respect to the absorption
of InSe without Au NPs are shown in Figure 2b. It reveals that the enhancement is high,
up to nearly 90. The enhancement peak value in the long wavelength
has a redshift as the period p increases, which is
attributed to the coupling between localized plasmons. The diameter D = 120 nm is selected in the following simulations as the
absorption enhancement is high over most of the visible spectrum.
Then the period of Au NPs is studied. According to Mie scattering
theory, the electromagnetic interactions between Au nanoantennas can
be ignored and the absorption in InSe presents weak enhancement if
the NP period is much bigger than NP size, which can be explained
by the fact that the strong near field in InSe is highly concentrated
surrounding the bottom edges of Au NPs, shown in Figure 2c. When the fill factor becomes
larger, electromagnetic coupling between NPs enhances the intensity
of the optical near field in the part of InSe where no Au NPs are
located. Until the maximum spectrum peak at the optimum particle density
is reached, the absorption capability of InSe has been markedly improved,
which is displayed in Figure 2d. In the short wavelength, the enhancement increases when p varies from 200 to 350 nm and decreases when p varies from 350 to 500 nm. Therefore, the diameter D and period p are set to 120 and 350 nm in the following
calculations.

silicon
(a) without Au NPs, (b) with the diameter of Au NPs varying, p fixed at 500 nm, (c,d) with the period of Au NPs varying, D fixed at 120 nm.

2.2 Underlying Physics of the Optical Absorption
Enhancement
This underlying physics can be intuitively elaborated
by the electric field diagram shown in Figure 3, which demonstrates that absorption enhancement
is attributed to the influence of plasmonic light concentration by
using gold NPs. As shown in Figure 3a, light energy is concentrated around the bottom edge
of the cylinder. The light source is polarized, resulting in the two
semicircle-like pictures as shown in Figure 3a. The concentrated energy would be a whole
circle with natural light. As shown in Figure 3b, the forward scattering is much stronger
than the back scattering, which means that most light energy at 769
nm is scattered into the layer of InSe. Because the SiO2 layer is very thin, the optical near field is enhanced and concentrated
in the InSe layer, and InSe has an absorption peak induced by LSPR
at this wavelength. When the wavelength of the scattered light is
appropriate to period p, a geometric resonance appears,
which could cause a dramatic modification of the measured optical
extinction when it happened at the same wavelength as the LSPR.

nm, (a) x–y axis view (b) x–z axis view.

2.3 Thickness of Silicon Oxide and the Height
of Au NPs
Then, the influence of the silicon oxide dielectric
layer is researched. The thickness of silicon oxide, which is located
between the active layer and reflective substrate Si, can be adjusted
to tune the optical absorption of the active layer.32 As shown in Figure 4, we investigate the effect of silicon oxide thickness on
optical absorption enhancement of the InSe layer. Because of the phase
delay of the reflective wave from InSe compared to the reflective
wave from Si, the InSe layer shows interferometric absorption on a
SiO2/Si substrate without Au NPs. Because of the interference
effects, the maximum reflection and minimum absorption appears periodically.
The effects of both the plasmonic resonance and optical interference
have to be considered for the design of nanostructures, to achieve
optimal enhanced absorption using Au NPs. When the intrinsic interferometric
absorption peak is suited to the plasmonic resonance wavelength, the
enhanced near field efficiently promotes the optical absorption of
InSe. Figure 4a displays
the absorption of InSe with varying thicknesses of SiO2, and the absorption enhancement spectra compared to the absorption
spectrum of InSe with 100 nm SiO2 are displayed in Figure 4b. Plasmonic resonance
of gold NPs gives rise to the maximum absorption at t = 300 nm and the intrinsic absorption peak occurs because of optical
interference, and they are perfectly matched at 769 nm. The thickness
of silicon oxide slightly affects the position of the plasmonic resonance,
from 769 to 779 nm. Meanwhile, the coupling between the optical interference
and plasmonic resonance plays an important role in the enhancement
of the light absorption, from 1.22 to 4.78, which means that the light
absorption enhancement is weakened by the mismatch between plasmonic
resonance and optical interference. To facilitate further research,
we use a thickness of 300 nm for silicon oxide in the following simulations.

Figure 4 (a) Absorption
ratio and (b) absorption enhancement spectra of
InSe with the varying thickness of SiO2 with NPs (SiO2 of 100 nm as a reference).

Next, we investigate the influence of Au particle height h on the absorption of the InSe layer. As shown in Figure 5a,b, the absorption
spectra showed dramatic enhancement on account of plasmonic resonance
because of Au NPs. When h increases from 10 to 60
nm, the enhancement peak value displays a blue shift as shown in Figure 5a, which is attributed
to the change of plasmonic resonance wavelength by manipulating h. When h is small, such as smaller than
30 nm, the plasmonic resonance is closely related with h. When h equals to 10 nm, the Au NPs can be seen
as a nanodisk, while when h equals to 30 nm, the
Au NPs can be seen as a cylinder. The near-field effects of LSPR mainly
concentrated on the lower surface of gold NPs. Therefore, when h is larger than 30 nm, it has little impact on near-field
effects and the blue shift of the plasmonic resonance wavelength becomes
small which is consistent with Figure 5b.

of
InSe with different heights of Au NPs (Au NPs of 10 nm as a reference).

2.4 Insertion of Insulators
For real
device applications, the quantum efficiency of optoelectronic devices
may be significantly lowered by carrier transport and exaction recombination
on the interface between InSe and Au NPs. Hence, the isolation between
InSe and gold NPs is necessary. As shown in Figure 6a,b, the influence of using SiO2 spacer as a transparent insulator spacer has been investigated. Figure 6a displays that the
insulator has a similar effect at the short wavelengths from 300 to
600 nm. The absorption peak results from the excitation of LSPR in
the long wavelengths from 700 to 900 nm. The LSPR varies with the
changes of the surrounding environment. Thus, as t1 increases, the LSPR displays a blue shift. As seen in Figure 6b, the absorption
enhancement is slightly weakened by increasing the thickness of the
spacers as near-field effects of LSPR are weakened.

and (b) absorption enhancement spectra of
InSe with different inserted SiO2 thicknesses (Inserted
SiO2 of 5 nm as a reference).

2.5 Absorption of InSe with Different Thicknesses
To verify the application of the Au NPs on InSe with different
thicknesses, the absorption of InSe with different thicknesses are
simulated, as shown in Figure 7a,b. For InSe with a thickness of 20 nm, Au NPs enhance the
absorption over the whole spectrum, which can be used in optical devices
such as photovoltaic devices and broadband photodetectors. With the
thickness increases, the enhancement value goes down as the absorption
of InSe without Au NPs increases. However, the enhancement effect
becomes obvious at the long wavelengths, which is meaningful to narrow
band detectors as shown in Figure 7b. Therefore, for different applications, one can manipulate
the absorption in the InSe layer through designing the Au NPs. The
enhancement value oscillates due to optical interference effect when
the thickness is larger than 50 nm.

absorption enhancement spectra

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate
that the InSe-based optoelectronic
devices can be combined with periodic Au NPs to promote optical absorption
enhancement and alternation. The optical absorption can be tuned by
plasmonic resonance of Au nanoantennas through changing the thickness
of silicon oxide, the insulator spacers, and the size and period of
Au NPs. The outstanding absorption efficiency and selectivity open
up a channel to increase the light responsibility of InSe by plasmonic
near-field effects and show great potential in optoelectronic devices,
such as InSe-based photodetectors, sensors, and photovoltaics.
