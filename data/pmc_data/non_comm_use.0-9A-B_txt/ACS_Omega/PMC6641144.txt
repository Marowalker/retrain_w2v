The
direct utilization of a natural feedstock in organic synthesis
is an utmost challenge because the selective production of one product
from a mixture of starting materials requires unprecedented substrate
selectivity. In the present study, a simple and convenient procedure
is evaluated for the substrate-selective alkenylation of a single
component in a mixture of organosulfur compounds. Pd-catalyzed alkenylation
of two-, three-, four-, and five-component mixtures of crude oil-derived
sulfur species led to the exclusive C–H functionalization of
only one compound. The observed remarkable substrate selectivity opens
new opportunities for sustainable organic synthesis.

Introduction
Organosulfur derivatives
represent a fundamental class of compounds
in the chemical industry and organic synthesis. Worldwide, the volume
of sulfur treated annually has increased to 70 100 000
metric tons.1 Several emerging applications
have been recently discovered, with a high demand for organosulfur
derivatives in the fields of catalysis, nanotechnology, materials
science, molecular electronics, asymmetric synthesis, biologically
active compounds, and drug development.2,3

These
cutting-edge applications stand in stark contrast with the
obsolete procedures used for the production of organosulfur chemicals
(Scheme 1). The majority
of their production originates from processed fossil fuels (oil),
in which organosulfur derivatives are present as contaminants.

Scheme 1 Comparison of the Conventional Processing of Organosulfur Species
from Natural Feedstock vs Direct Transformation
Currently, a hydrodesulfurization procedure
is used in petroleum
refineries to remove sulfur, followed by conversion to H2S and finally to elemental sulfur (Scheme 1). Organosulfur derivatives can be reconstructed
(e.g., in the form of thiols) using reactions with organic halides
followed by utilization in organic synthesis to produce the desired
products. This procedure transforms the organosulfur species into
elemental sulfur and then rebuilds the required products through a
multistep synthesis. Obviously, the overall process is completely
unsustainable from the point of view of the preparation of organosulfur
products. The high energy consumption, cost inefficiency, waste generation,
and environmental contamination are significant drawbacks.

For
organic synthesis, we propose a more efficient approach involving
a single-step procedure for the transformation of organosulfur components
available in natural feedstock (Scheme 1). The idea is to functionalize only one component
in the mixture at a time and to generate a single product. The separation
of a functionalized product containing a polar group (e.g., COOR)
from a nonpolar hydrocarbon mixture is a routine task. Therefore,
a single product can be obtained from a mixture of starting materials.
Achieving this challenging aim requires the development of catalytic
systems with unprecedented substrate selectivity.

It should
be pointed out that the proposed methodology is not an
alternative for the hydrodesulfurization of fuels. Fine organic synthesis
is the target for the methodology developed with the aim of sustainable
synthesis of organic derivatives of sulfur via direct C–H functionalization
of crude oil-derived starting materials.

C–H functionalization
is one of the best approaches for
introducing functional groups.4 A variety
of processes leading to the creation of new C–C and C–X
bonds have been developed.5−9 The efficiency of C–H alkenylation was improved by using
a suitable directing group, which typically contains N and O heteroatoms.
It is important to note that sulfur-only directing groups (without
other heteroatoms) are quite rare.8−12 However, successful C–H functionalization
with distal and weakly coordinating groups is an advantage of Pd-catalyzed
reactions.13

In the present study,
we have evaluated the performance of a known
C–H alkenylation reaction with sulfur atom as the directing
group.10 Amazingly, under optimized conditions,
Pd-catalyzed C–H alkenylation of a mixture of organosulfur
compounds can be performed with unprecedented substrate selectivity.
These results demonstrated a promising potential of C–H functionalization
with regard to the processing of natural feedstock and practical applications.
To the best of our knowledge, selective C–H functionalization
in the mixture of model crude oil-derived components has never been
shown earlier.

Results and Discussion
Several possible
components and derivatives of the natural feedstock
were investigated in a native state without additional directing groups
(1–5), and these substrates were
compared with model compounds (6, 7) bearing
a pyridyl-directing group (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Substrates for C–H bond alkenylation used in the
present
study.

The olefination of arenes was
conducted using ethyl acrylate as
an olefin, and the reaction was performed at 130 °C for 24 h
in 1,2-dichloroethane as the solvent (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Model Alkenylation
Reaction Used
Different palladium
compounds were studied as catalyst precursors
(e.g., Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, PdCl2(MeCN)2, PdCl2(CyNC)2, etc.).14 The desired alkenylation occurred only with Pd(OAc)2, which was used in the subsequent reactions. Careful selection
of the oxidants was carried out to mediate the transformation of interest
and simultaneously to avoid the oxidation of the sulfur group. Several
oxidants (i.e., K2S2O8, PhI(OAc)2, AgOTFA, and oxygen) were examined with each substrate,14 and a mixture of gaseous oxygen and solid AgOTFA
was the most efficient combination. For the individual sulfur substrates
shown in Figure 1,
product formation was observed for natural feedstock species 2, 3, and 4 and for model compounds 6 and 7, but sulfane 1 and sulfoxide 5 remained unreacted.14

For
a comprehensive analysis, all of the possible two-component
combinations of substrates were examined under similar conditions
(equimolar amounts of the two compounds were used as starting materials).
A slight excess of the olefin (1.2 equiv) and 2.0 equiv of the oxidant
were used to facilitate the transformation of interest. The extent
to which the catalyst would render a selective transformation is the
most important factor.

Surprisingly, for all of the studied
two-component mixtures, only
one product was observed with a single component in the mixture subjected
to alkenylation. Benzyl(phenyl)sulfane (2) was the most
reactive among all of the substrates. In the studied mixtures, sulfane 2 was selectively functionalized to afford the respective
product in good yield. Phenyl(2-phenylethyl)sulfane (3) was the second-most reactive substrate to afford the corresponding
alkenylation product in all of the mixtures except when mixed with
benzyl(phenyl)sulfane (2). A good yield of the corresponding
alkenylation product was also observed (61%). Surprisingly, phenyl(3-phenylpropyl)-sulfane
(4), which contains three CH2 groups in the
chain, was totally inactive. Product formation was not observed for
diphenylsulfane (1) or diphenylsulfoxide (5). For comparative purposes, we utilized 2-(phenylthio)pyridine (6) and 2-(phenylsulfinyl)pyridine (7), the structural
analogs of Ph2S and Ph2SO, which contain a pyridine
ring instead of a phenyl group. Indeed, both substrates were alkenylated
but with lower reactivity compared with benzyl(phenyl)sulfane (2) and phenyl(2-phenylethyl)sulfane (3).

On the basis of the data acquired, we can estimate the following
order of substrates based on their reactivity: benzyl(phenyl)sulfane
(2) > phenyl(2-phenylethyl)sulfane (3) >
2-(phenylsulfinyl)pyridine (7) > 2-(phenylthio)pyridine
(6) > phenyl(3-phenylpropyl)sulfane (4),
diphenylsulfane (1), diphenylsulfoxide (5).

For all of the two-component systems, the reaction proceeded
exclusively
with one component in the mixture, and naturally occurring thioethers 2 and 3 were more reactive than the corresponding
thiopyridines or sulfoxides. In addition, with a larger amount of
olefin (2.0 equiv), no alkenylation of the second component in the
mixture was observed. However, the dialkenylated product from the
same substrate was formed.

Inspired by the results for the two-component
systems, we evaluated
the selectivity of representative multicomponent mixtures that contained
several sulfur species as derivatives of a natural feedstock (Table 2).

For the three-component
mixture consisting of Ph2S,
Ph2SO, and PhCH2SPh, the alkenylation occurred
exclusively for PhCH2SPh (entry 1, product yield 45%),
as predicted by the established reactivity order. Alkenylation of
the three-component mixture consisting of Ph2S, Ph2SO, and Ph(CH2)2SPh led to the selective
alkenylation of Ph(CH2)2SPh (entry 2, 52%).
For the three-component mixture consisting of Ph2SO, PhCH2SPh, and Ph(CH2)2SPh, the alkenylation
occurred only for PhCH2SPh (entry 3, 50%). A similar result
was achieved for the mixture consisting of PhCH2SPh, Ph(CH2)2SPh, and Ph(CH2)3SPh (entry
4, 48%) with high selectivity. The addition of pyridyl-containing
substrates to the system did not change the alkenylation substrate,
which remained PhCH2SPh (entry 5, 42%). An increase in
the number of thioether/sulfoxide components to four and five (entries
6 and 7, respectively) did not affect the selectivity of the alkenylation
process, which led to the exclusive alkenylation of PhCH2SPh (50 and 52% yields, respectively). Therefore, the reaction solely
targeted one component of the three-, four-, and five-component systems,
and the order of reactivity of the substrates observed for the two-component
mixtures was retained in these cases.

To address the scope of
the reaction, other olefins (methyl acrylate
and n-butyl acrylate) were evaluated, and the observed
selectivity was retained. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of
this reaction for practical application, we performed a 10-fold scaling
of the reaction mixtures and observed that the selectivity and the
product yields remained unchanged even though a longer reaction time
(36 h instead of 24 h) was required. Importantly, the sulfur center
was preserved in its native state without oxidation by the oxidant
used to mediate the reaction.

The plausible reaction mechanism
involves the coordination of the
substrate, followed by S-directed C–H activation, alkene insertion,
and β-hydrogen elimination (Scheme 3). The difference in the reactivity of the
studied substrates can originate from the first step of the catalytic
cycle. The substrate with n = 1 possesses the most
favorable geometry for coordination and subsequent C–H activation.
The reaction should be possible for the substrate with n = 2, whereas the involvement of the substrate with a longer chain
(n ≥ 3) is unlikely. The proposed mechanistic
picture is in agreement with the observed experimental data. Indeed,
as a preliminary mechanistic study, the recorded kinetic curves suggested
that the favorable binding of the substrates to the catalyst plays
a key role in the selective transformation because minimal differences
were observed in the reactions involving individual components (Figure S1). A more detailed mechanistic understanding
of the reaction involving a mixture of substrates is challenging and
will be the subject of future studies.

Scheme 3 Plausible Reaction
Mechanism
Conclusions
To
summarize, outstanding substrate selectivity was observed in
the C–H alkenylation of organosulfur compounds consisting of
crude oil-derived components. Structurally similar components can
be distinguished using a selective catalytic transformation. After
the incorporation of a functional group (i.e., the CH=CH–COOEt
group in the studied case), the separation of the product from the
mixture becomes a routine task. By contrast, the separation of the
initial mixture of structurally very similar sulfur species into individual
compounds and the destroy/rebuild sequence are extremely cost- and
energy-demanding processes.

Crude oil components are the richest
natural source of organosulfur
compounds with the largest turnover of sulfur species in chemical
manufacturing. Therefore, a mixture of naturally occurring sulfur
species is a very cheap starting material. If preliminary separation
and purification of the starting materials is not required, this approach
can change the paradigm of organic compound production. This discovery
opens up new opportunities in the field of sustainable organic chemistry
with unprecedented cost and energy efficiency.

Of course, it
should be noted that the present study demonstrates
only a general concept using a simple model system. Particularly,
the substrate selectivity of C–H functionalization in more
complex and randomly varied mixtures of natural crude oils should
be studied in more detail. Another important point is to find a suitable
and easily available oxidant instead of a stoichiometric amount of
silver salt. Several improvements would be required for the development
of a catalytic procedure to functionalize natural crude oil samples.

Experimental
Section
Following is the typical procedure for the alkenylation
of a single
substrate. The substrate (0.25 mmol), ethyl acrylate (0.30 mmol or
0.50 mmol for pyridine-containing substrates), Pd(OAc)2 (5.6 mg, 10 mol %), and the selected solid oxidant (0.50 mmol, except
those with oxygen only) in either DCE or MeNO2 (2 mL) were
placed in a 25 mL tube with a screw cap. For all of the reactions
except those with oxygen, the test tube was filled with argon and
sealed. For reactions with oxygen, oxygen was bubbled through the
solution for 2 min, and then the tube was sealed. The reaction vessel
was placed in an oil bath and heated to 110 °C for 24 h under
vigorous stirring. Then, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool
to room temperature and filtered through a pad of celite, which was
flushed with several portions of an ethyl acetate/hexane mixture (1:4)
until the total volume of the solvent was 25 mL. All of the washes
were combined, and the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure
at 65 °C. Then, the residue was subjected to flash column chromatography
(silica gel, ethyl acetate/hexane = 1:30 − 1:10, v/v) to obtain
the desired products. The products were characterized using high-resolution
ESI-MS and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Also
see Table S1 for additional details regarding
the experimental conditions.

ethyl acrylate (0.30 mmol or 0.50 mmol for pyridine-containing substrates),
Pd(OAc)2 (5.6 mg, 10 mol %), and AgOTFA (110.5 mg, 0.50
mmol) in DCE (5 mL) was placed in a 25 mL tube with a screw cap. Then,
oxygen was bubbled through the solution for 2 min, and the tube was
sealed, placed in an oil bath, and stirred at 130 °C for 24 h.
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through

evaporated under reduced pressure at 50 °C. The residue was subjected
to flash column chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate/hexane =
1:30 − 1:10, v/v) to obtain the desired products. The products
were identified using 1H and 13C NMR and HR-ESI-MS.
