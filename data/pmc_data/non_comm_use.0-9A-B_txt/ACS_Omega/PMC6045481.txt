In this study, we
outline the synthesis of isatin–ferrocenyl
chalcone and 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin–ferrocene
conjugates along with their antimicrobial evaluation against the human
mucosal pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis. The introduction of a triazole ring among the synthesized conjugates
improved the activity profiles with most of the compounds in the library,
exhibiting 100% growth inhibition in a preliminary susceptibility
screen at 100 μM. IC50 determination of the most
potent compounds in the set revealed an inhibitory range between 2
and 13 μM. Normal flora microbiome are unaffected by these compounds,
suggesting that these may be new chemical scaffolds for the discovery
of new drugs against trichomonad infections.

Introduction
Trichomoniasis, a nonviral
sexually transmitted disease caused
by the protozoal pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis,1 mainly infects the urinary tract, vagina,
and prostate.2 A recent survey indicated
that there are about 276 million cases of trichomoniasis occurring
globally of which 42.8 million cases occur in Africa (including sub-Saharan
Africa)3 and 3.7 million in the United
States,4 mostly affecting women under the
age of 40 years.5,6 In most of the cases, the infection
is asymptomatic,7 while the common symptoms
might include malodorous vaginal
discharge,8 dyspareunia, dysuria, lower
abdominal pain, or vulvovaginal irritation.9 In certain cases, serious complications such as pelvic inflammation,
cervical dysplasia, vaginitis, infertility, low birth weight infant,
and preterm delivery may occur.10 Metronidazole
and tinidazole are the only US-FDA drugs approved for the treatment
of trichomoniasis.11 However, the emergence
of drug resistance among the clinical isolates has prompted the need
for the development of new and efficient structural entities with
potentially low incidence of resistance.

Isatin is a promising
class of biologically active scaffolds with
tolerance to humans12 and a good platform
for structure modification and derivatization. Isatin derivatives
display a myriad of activities including anticancer,13 antidepressant,14 antifungal,15 anti-HIV,16 and anti-inflammatory
properties.17 Isatin-β-thiosemicarbazones
have been recently investigated for their selectivity to kill gp-over-expressing
tumor cells in vitro.18 SU11248 (Sutent),
a 5-fluoro-3-substituted isatin derivative, was approved by FDA in
2006 for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma and gastrointestinal
stromal tumors.19 Selective inhibitory
activity of 5,7-dibromo-N-(p-trifluoromethylbenzyl)isatin
against lymphoma and leukemic cancer cell lines over freshly isolated,
nontransformed human peripheral blood lymphocytes has been disclosed
recently.20 A recent report of Vine et
al. has shown the potency of the N-alkyl isatin derivatives against
the multidrug-resistant cell lines, viz., U937VbR and MES-SA/Dx5,
and observed bioequivalent dose-dependent cytotoxicity to that of
the parental control cell lines.21 In vitro
selective inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase has also been reported
for the N-substituted isatin–piperazine derivative.22 Many isatin derivatives have also been evaluated
for their antimicrobial potential with isatin-β-thiosemicarbazones
exhibiting minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78 and 0.39
mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.23 Schiff base of 5-substituted isatin
has also been found to be active against Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (MIC = 6.25 μg/mL).24

Chalcones, an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl-linked
framework,25 belong to the biologically
active class of compounds
with antileishmanial,26 antibacterial,27 antifungal,28 antitumor,29 antimalarial,30 antiviral,31 antitubercular,32 anti-invasive,33 antioxidant,34 anti-inflammatory,35 and antiplatelet properties.36 Naturally
occurring Licochalcone A has shown promising antibacterial activity
against Bacillus subtilis, S. aureus, and Micrococcus luteus.37 Chalcone-based conjugates have shown
enormous biological potential with chalcone–thiazolidine–dione
conjugates, which are proven to be 8 and 64 times more active than
the reference drugs, norfloxacin (MIC = 1.0 μg/mL) and oxacillin
(MIC = 0.5 μg/mL) against MRSA CCARM 3167 and 3506, respectively.38 Imidazole–chalcone conjugates were found
to be active against Aspergillus fumigatus,(39) while ferrocenyl chalcones act as the
HepG2 inhibitor and are nontoxic to human fibroblasts.40 Recently, metronidazole–chalcone conjugates
have proven to be 4 times more potent than the standard drug metronidazole
against T. vaginalis.41

One of the auspicious branches of bioorganometallic
chemistry includes
the synthesis of sandwich and half-sandwich complexes with important
biological activity.42 Ferrocene represents
a momentous scaffold in present day drug discovery paradigm because
of its robustness, reactivity, redox properties, lipophilicity, and
low cytotoxicity.43 Replacement of a purely
organic component with ferrocene has shown to improve the biological
potential of the target compounds as evidenced by ferrocenyl conjugates
of commercial antiestrogen tamoxifen and antiandrogen nilutamide.44 Ferroquine is the most exemplary contribution
of ferrocene to the improvement of antiplasmodial potential of chloroquine
and is under clinical trials.45

Previous
reports from our group have shown the synthesis of an
isatin-based scaffold, viz., mono and bis-uracil–isatin, isatin–4-aminoquinoline,
and isatin−β-lactam conjugates tethered via 1H-1,2,3-triazole and β-amino alcohol along with their
preliminary in vitro evaluation against T. vaginalis.46 In continuation with our research
efforts,47 the present study describes
the synthesis of isatin–ferrocenyl chalcone and 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin–ferrocene conjugates along
with their antitrichomonad activities.

Results and Discussion
The methodology for the synthesis of isatin–ferrocenyl chalcone
conjugates involved base-promoted N-alkylation of C-5-functionalized
isatins with O-alkyl-bromo-ferrocenyl chalcones.
The precursor, viz., O-alkyl-bromo-ferrocenyl chalcones 3, was prepared via an initial base-promoted O-alkylation
of 4-hydroxy-acetophenone 1 with various dibromoalkanes
at 60 °C for 8 h to afford the corresponding O-alkyl bromo-acetophenones 2. Subsequent aldol condensation
of O-alkyl-bromoacetophenones with ferrocene carboxyaldehyde
delivered the precursor O-alkyl-bromo-ferrocenyl
chalcones in good to excellent yield (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Compounds 5a–x
Sodium hydride-promoted reaction
of C-5-substituted isatin with O-alkyl-bromo-ferrocenyl
chalcone at room temperature (rt)
for 3 h resulted in the isolation of desired isatin–ferrocenyl
chalcone conjugates which were purified via flash chromatography using
a mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane (20:80) as the eluent. The structure
to the conjugates 5 was assigned on the basis of spectral
data and analytical lines of evidence. Compound 5g, for
example, exhibited a molecular ion peak at 519.3688 (m/z) in its high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS).
The salient features of its 1H NMR spectrum included the
appearance of a multiplet at δ 4.16–4.19 (7H) corresponding
to cyclopentadiene ring protons (5H) along with a methylene and singlets
at δ 4.49 (2H) and 4.60 (2H) corresponding to ferrocene ring
protons. The appearance of doublets at δ 7.12 (1H, J = 15.3 Hz) and 7.74 (1H, J = 15.3 Hz) confirmed
the presence of trans-olefinic protons of ferrocenyl chalcones. The
appearance of characteristics peaks at δ 161.40 and 188.03 ppm
corresponding to isatin ring carbonyls along with the requisite number
of carbons in 13C NMR spectra further corroborated the
assigned structure.

Synthetic methodology for the synthesis
of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered
isatin–ferrocene conjugates 12 involved an initial
base-promoted N-alkylation of isatin with dibromoalkanes at 80 °C
with subsequent treatment with sodium azide to afford the corresponding N-alkylazidoisatins 8 (Scheme 2). The second precursor, viz., ((prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)methyl)ferrocene 11, was prepared via an initial reduction of ferrocene carboxyaldehyde 9 with NaBH4 in dry tetrahydrofuran to afford ferrocenyl-methanol 10, which was subsequently O-propargylated. Cu-promoted azide–alkyne
cycloaddition of 8 with O-propargylated ferrocene methanol 11 led to the isolation of crude product, which was purified
on silica gel chromatography (60:120) using methanol/chloroform (10:90)
mixture as the eluent to yield 12 in good to excellent
yields (Scheme 3).
The structure to the compound was assigned on the basis of spectral
studies and analytical evidence. For example, compound 12m exhibited a molecular ion peak at 504.0652 in its HRMS. Its 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of a singlet at δ
4.14 corresponding to 5H (cyclopentadiene ring of ferrocene) along
with singlets at δ 4.16 (2H) and δ 4.22 (2H) because of
the presence of −OCH2 protons along with the characteristic
singlet at δ 7.49 (1H) corresponding to the triazole ring proton.
The appearance of absorption peaks at δ 68.5, 68.6, 68.8, and
82.7 in its 13C NMR spectrum corresponding to ferrocene
ring carbons along with the presence of isatin ring carbonyl at δ
181.2 corroborated the assigned structure.

Azido Isatin
Scheme 3 Synthesis of Compounds 12a–x
The synthesized compounds, viz., 5a–x and 12a–x, were evaluated for their inhibitory
activity
against T. vaginalis, and the results
are summarized in Table 1. As evident, the activity profiles of synthesized scaffolds, viz., 5a–x, showed an interesting structure–activity
relationship (SAR) with activity being dependent upon the nature of
substituent at the C-5 position of the isatin ring as well as the
length of the alkyl chain, introduced as a linker. Apparently, among
conjugates with unsubstituted (R = H) isatin, the activities showed
improvement with increase in the chain length from n = 2 to n = 4 as evidenced by 5a–c, while a further increase in the chain length reduced the activity.
The introduction of a methyl substituent at the C-5 position of the
isatin ring decreased the activities except in the case of 5g (n = 2) and 5i (n = 4). Introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents, viz., fluoro
and chloro, in general improved the growth inhibition activity against T. vaginalis irrespective of the length of the alkyl
chain linker. The conjugates, viz., 5o (R = F, n = 4) and 5s (R = Cl, n =
2), with an optimal combination of electron-withdrawing substituents
at the C-5 position of the isatin ring and short alkyl chain length
proved to be the most potent among the test compounds with 100% growth
inhibition. Interestingly, the introduction of a 1H-1,2,3-triazole ring among isatin–ferrocene conjugates, 12a–x, substantially improved the activities with most
of the synthesized conjugates exhibiting 100% growth inhibition. Analysis
of SAR among 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered conjugates
revealed the activity to be independent on the nature of the substituent
present at the C-5 position of the isatin ring as well as the length
of the alkyl chain used as the spacer except in cases where the octyl
(n = 8) chain was used. The presence of the octyl
chain length reduced the antitrichomonad activities as evident by
conjugates 12f, 12l, 12r, and 12x exhibiting 64.70, 49.16, 52.70, and 35.38% growth inhibition,
respectively.

Most potent conjugates of the two
series were further evaluated
for their IC50 values and compared with metronidazole,
the only FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of trichomoniasis
(Table 2). As evident,
although the conjugates were not as active as metronidazole, most
of the compounds displayed low IC50 values. The conjugates,
viz., 5w, 12c, 12d, 12j, and 12p, emerged as the most active conjugates with
IC50 values of 7.13, 5.53, 5.82, 2.26, and 2.96 μM,
respectively.

To ascertain
if the observed inhibitory effect of these compounds
is due to their activity and not cytotoxicity, the conjugates were
evaluated on normal human flora consisting of the nonpathogenic strains, Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 23272), Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 43560), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 53103). No cytotoxic
effects from any of these synthesized compounds were observed for
any of the normal flora, which is suggestive of the fact that these
compounds are antiparasitic.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a series
of isatin–ferrocenyl chalcone and
isatin–ferrocene conjugates were synthesized either via aliphatic
nucleophilic substitution reaction or via azide–alkyne cycloaddition
reaction, respectively, and were evaluated for their inhibitory activities
against T. vaginalis. The lack of a
chalcone moiety and the introduction of a 1H-1,2,3
triazole ring substantially improved the inhibitory activities with
most of the conjugates exhibiting 100% growth inhibition at the preliminary
screening concentration of 100 μM. The lack of dependence of
activity upon the nature of substituent at the C-5 position of the
isatin ring or the length of the alkyl chain introduced as the linker
among 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin–ferrocenes
is suggestive of the fact that such conjugates may act as therapeutic
templates for the design of new antitrichomonads.

Experimental
Section
General Information
Melting points are uncorrected
and determined via an open capillary method using a Veego Precision
digital melting point (MP-D) apparatus. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 with Bruker AVANCE
II (500 and 125 MHz) using tetramethylsilane as the internal standard.
Chemical shift and coupling constant values are expressed in parts
per million and hertz, respectively, while splitting patterns are
designated as s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, m: multiplet, dd:
double doublet, ddd: doublet of a doublet of a doublet, and br: broad
peak. Elemental analysis was performed on a Heraeus CHN-O rapid elemental
analyzer, while mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker high-resolution
mass spectrometer (microOTOF-QII). Column chromatography was carried
out on a silica gel (60–120 mesh) with ethylacetate/hexane
as the eluent.47e

Materials and Methods for
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Assays
T. vaginalis strain G3 was cultured
for 24 h at 37 °C. To perform the preliminary antimicrobial screen,
the compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain
stock concentrations of 100 μM; 5 μL aliquots of these
suspensions were diluted in 5 mL of trypticase–yeast extract–maltose
diamond’s media to obtain a final concentration of the compound
of 100 μM. After 24 h of exposure to the compounds, any remaining
motile cells were visualized and manually counted using a hemacytometer.
Cell counts were normalized to the DMSO controls. These data sets
were then transformed using GraphPad Prism software, and the sample
size consists of four independent trials carried out on four different
days (to account for possible variation in the parasite population).
The IC50 values were determined by titration assays of
increasing concentrations of each compound, usually within a range
of 5–40 μM, by a regression analysis using Prism software
from GraphPad. The calculated IC50 values of the compounds
were then confirmed by using the same assay described previously.

Cytotoxicity Assay for Normal Flora Microbiota
Cultures
of nonpathogenic bacteria such as L. reuteri (ATCC 23272), L. acidophilus (ATCC
43560), and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53103),
known to comprise the human mucosal microbiome, were grown in Lactobacilli
MRS media at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 (nonpathogenic) was cultured
in Luria broth at 37 °C aerobically. Stock solutions (100 μM)
of synthesized compounds and vehicle control DMSO were diluted to
100 μM in media to afford working dilutions. Empty BDL-sensi
disks (6 mm) were incubated in the working dilutions at rt for 20
min. Streaked agar plates of chosen bacteria were incubated with disks
containing the vehicle control, compounds, or various antibiotic disks
[levofloxacin (5 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), and gentamicin
(120 μg)] and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Sensitivity
to the vehicle control, compounds, and antibiotics was determined
via the measurement of zones of inhibition around each disk in millimeter.
All organisms were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC).47c
