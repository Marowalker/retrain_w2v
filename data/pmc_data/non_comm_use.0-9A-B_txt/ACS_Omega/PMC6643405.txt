The
development of low-cost adsorbent with excellent adsorption
property remains a big challenge. Herein, the functionalization of
natural peach gum polysaccharide (PGP) with multiple amine groups
for the removal of toxic Cr(VI) ions from water was studied. The obtained
PGP-NH2 gel exhibited high-removal efficiency (>99.5%)
toward Cr(VI) ions, especially with relatively low initial concentration
of Cr(VI) ions (≤250 mg/L). The influences of pH, ionic strength,
contact time, initial concentration, and temperature on the adsorption
of Cr(VI) ions were systematically investigated. The PGP-NH2 gel showed rapid adsorption rate and could reach adsorption equilibrium
within about 40 min. The Cr(VI) ion uptake process could be described
by pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. The maximum
adsorption capacity of PGP-NH2 gel could reach 188.32 mg/g.
Thermodynamic investigation results indicated the spontaneous and
exothermic characteristic of the uptake process. Moreover, the PGP-NH2 gel also exhibited favorable reusability, and 135.52 mg/g
of adsorption capacity was retained even after being reused for five
times. Considering its low cost and superior uptake property, the
PGP-NH2 gel holds a great promise for employing as an adsorbent
to treat Cr(VI) ion-containing wastewater.

Introduction
In the past decades,
water pollution problem caused by the discharge
of heavy-metal-ion-containing wastewater from various industries such
as electroplating, leather tanning, petroleum refining, battery manufacturing,
pigment, and plastic production has raised worldwide concerns.1−4 Because the heavy metal ions can be accumulated via food chain and
may cause carcinogenic and toxic effects on human healthy and ecological
system, it is essential to eliminate toxic heavy metal ions from water
before discharging into aquatic systems. Among various heavy metal
ions, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) ion is considered to be one of
the most toxic heavy metal ions.5−7 Excessive intake of Cr(VI) ions
can cause serious diseases such as lung cancer, kidney damage, nervous
system failure, pulmonary congestion, dermatitis, and kidney circulation.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) reported that the
residual concentration of Cr(VI) ions for drinking water regulation
limit is 50 μg/L.8 Nowadays, various
techniques such as ion exchange, chemical precipitation, membrane
filtration, and electrodialysis techniques have been explored to remove
Cr(VI) ions from water.9−12 However, most of them suffer from the drawbacks of high cost and
low removal efficiency. In contrast, the adsorption technique received
special attention because of its attractive merits including low cost,
ease of operation, high efficiency, insensitive to toxic pollutants,
and without secondary pollution.13−16 On the other hand, the recycle
of chromium from wastewater also received intensive attention from
the view of economic reason. In this regard, the chromium resource
can be well-recycled from wastewater by the adsorption method.

Although a myriad of materials such as activated carbon,17 montmorillonite,18 and polymer gel19 have been developed
as adsorbents to adsorb Cr(VI) ions from water, much attention was
paid on the use of renewable biomass such as chitosan,20 husk biomass,21 and
fungal biomass22 as an adsorbent to remove
Cr(VI) ions from water because of its favorable biocompatibility,
low cost, facile availability, and sustainable characteristic. Nevertheless,
most of the reported biomass-based adsorbents showed low adsorption
capacity (≤100 mg/g), slow adsorption rate, and poor reusability,
which significantly limited their practical applications.23

Natural peach gum polysaccharide (PGP),
secreted from the fruit
and trunk of peach trees as a result of mechanical injury or microbial
invasion, is a kind of heteropolysaccharide that generally consists
of galactose, xylose, arabinose, uronic acid, and mannose.24−26 Because peach trees are widely distributed in the world, the global
PGP resource is abundant. Nevertheless, crude peach gum showed poor
solubility in water because of its very high molecular weight and
highly branched macromolecular structure.26 Water-soluble PGP can be prepared by the hydrolysis treatment of
the crude peach gum.25−27 Until now, the PGP has been studied for applications
in medicine, food industry, fluorescent materials, dye, and heavy
metal ion adsorbents.28−34 To our knowledge, the utilization of PGP as an adsorbent to remove
Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solution has not been reported. So far, the
development of biomass-based adsorbents that simultaneously possess
rapid adsorption rate, superior adsorption capacity, and favorable
reusability remains a big challenge.

To address this challenge,
this study aims to fabricate high-performance
Cr(VI) ion adsorbent from renewable PGP. Because amine groups have
been demonstrated to show high binding capability toward Cr(VI) ions,35−39 the synthesis of PGP-NH2 gel with multiple amine groups
was performed. The employment of PGP-NH2 gel as an adsorbent
to capture Cr(VI) ions from water was studied in detail. Various influence
factors including solution pH, ionic strength, contact time, initial
concentration of Cr(VI) ions, and temperature on the adsorption process
were systematically evaluated. Moreover, the desorption and regeneration
capability of PGP-NH2 gel was also examined. It is expected
that the prepared PGP-NH2 gel could exhibit superior adsorption
performance toward Cr(VI) ions.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of PGP-NH2 Gel Adsorbent
Scheme 1 shows the
synthetic route to the PGP-NH2 gel. Water-soluble PGP with
branched macromolecular structure and numerous hydroxyl groups can
be easily prepared by hydrolysis of crude peach gum in acidic solution.27,34 Considering amine groups could show strong interaction with Cr(VI)
ions,35−37 we think that the PGP gel with multiple amine groups
should be suitable for the removal of Cr(VI) ions. On one hand, the
presence of amine groups can enhance the adsorption capacity of PGP
toward Cr(VI) ions. On the other hand, the PGP in the form of gel
can be easily separated from water after adsorption. Benefiting from
the numerous hydroxyl groups of PGP, the PGP-NH2 gel with
multiple amine groups can be readily achieved by first reaction with
epichlorohydrin to introduce epoxy groups and followed by reaction
with diethylenetriamine (DEA) to cross-link the PGP macromolecular
chains (Scheme 1).
It is worth noting that the prepared PGP-NH2 gel cannot
be dissolved in water and can be easily separated from water by filtration
treatment.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of the Synthesis of PGP-NH2 Gel
for the Removal of Cr(VI) Ions from Water
The photographs of crude peach gum, PGP, and PGP-NH2 gel are presented in Figure 1. As can be seen, white PGP powder with excellent water
solubility
can be prepared by hydrolysis treatment of brown crude peach gum.
After the cross-linking reaction, PGP-NH2 gel with yellow
color was obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum
of PGP shows that PGP is mainly composed of C and O elements, and
no obvious N element is observed (Figure 2a). After introduction of amine groups, strong
N 1s peak can be clearly observed in the XPS spectrum of PGP-NH2 gel. According to the XPS result, the content of N element
associated with the content of amine groups is determined to be 10.86
mmol/g, which is close to the element analysis result (11.30 mmol/g)
(see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Such a high content of amine groups provides a favorable platform
for the removal of Cr(VI) ions. Compared with the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectrum of PGP (Figure 2b), the absorption bands centered at 3414
and 1041 cm–1 associated with the O–H and
C–O vibrations, respectively, decreased significantly and a
new absorption peak at 3209 cm–1 corresponding to
the N–H vibration appeared for the PGP-NH2 sample.
These results are due to the hydroxyl groups of PGP that have been
reacted with epichlorohydrin and DEA to form amine groups.

and N2 adsorption–desorption curve (f) of the freeze-dried
PGP-NH2 sample.

In addition, the zeta potential value of PGP and PGP-NH2 samples was determined in the pH range of 2–9 (Figure 2c). Obviously, the
PGP exhibited
negatively charged characteristic in the whole pH range because of
the presence of numerous oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g.,
−OH and −COOH).27,34 In contrast, the PGP-NH2 sample showed positively charged value in the whole pH range,
and the zeta potential value increased with the decrease of solution
pH (e.g., 60.34 and 20.67 mV at pH 2 and 9, respectively). The positively
charged surface of PGP-NH2 sample is attributed to the
introduction of multiple amine groups. With decreasing pH, the amine
groups are protonated, leading to a large zeta potential value. On
the basis of XPS, FTIR, and zeta potential results, it is concluded
that PGP-NH2 gel with numerous amine groups was successfully
prepared. Considering adsorption applications, the swelling behavior
of PGP-NH2 gel in aqueous solution was also investigated.
As shown in Figure 2d, the swelling process of PGP-NH2 gel could reach equilibrium
within about 5 min with the swelling ratio of 823%. The morphology
of the PGP-NH2 gel after freeze-drying was observed by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2e). As can be seen, the PGP-NH2 sample possesses porous microstructure, which is constructed by
the aggregation of cross-linked particles. It should be pointed out
that the cross-linked particles possess smooth surface (see Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information). In addition,
the surface area of PGP-NH2 sample was determined to be
about 2.38 m2/g based on the N2 adsorption–desorption
curve, as shown in Figure 2f. It is expected that the porous microstructure associated
with a relatively high surface area can offer a favorable platform
for the following adsorption application.

Removal Efficiency Study
Before systematically investigating
the adsorption performance of PGP-NH2 gel toward Cr(VI)
ions, a simple adsorption test was performed by adding 50 mg of freeze-dried
PGP-NH2 gel into 5 mL of aqueous solution of Cr(VI) ions
(600 mg/L). As depicted in the inset of Figure 3a, the Cr(VI) ion solution with yellow color
became colorless after adding PGP-NH2 gel for only 30 min,
suggesting that the PGP-NH2 gel possesses high removal
efficiency toward Cr(VI) ions. Then, the removal efficiency of PGP-NH2 gel was determined in detail by adding 50 mg of PGP-NH2 gel into 10 mL of Cr(VI) ions solution with an initial concentration
from 50 to 1000 mg/L at pH 2.0 and room temperature. The PGP-NH2 gel exhibited very high removal efficiency (>99.95%) when
the concentration of Cr(VI) ions was lower than 250 mg/L (Figure 3a). This is because
the number of binding sites on the surface of PGP-NH2 gel
is large enough to capture almost all of the Cr(VI) ions in water.
Particularly, when the initial concentration of Cr(VI) ions was lower
than 100 mg/L, the residual concentration of Cr(VI) ions in water
after adsorption was lower than 50 μg/L, which could meet the
standard of drinking water proposed by US-EPA. At a high initial concentration
of Cr(VI) ions, the binding sites of PGP-NH2 gel cannot
capture all of the Cr(VI) ions and thus the removal efficiency of
PGP-NH2 gel decreased obviously. For example, the removal
efficiency of PGP-NH2 gel dropped from 99.7 to 89.5% with
increasing the initial concentration of Cr(VI) ions from 250 to 1000
mg/L.

Figure 3 (a) Removal efficiency of PGP-NH2 gel with diverse initial
concentrations of Cr(VI) ions. Insets: Photographs of aqueous solution
of Cr(VI) ions (600 mg/L, 5 mL) before and after adding 50 mg of PGP-NH2 gel for 30 min. (b) Adsorption capacities of PGP and amine-functionalized
PGP gels toward Cr(VI) ions (C0 = 1000
mg/L).

To probe the influence of amine
group content on the adsorption
of Cr(VI) ions, PGP gels with a diverse content of amine groups were
prepared by adjusting the weight feed ratio of DEA to PGP (fwt) (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). In addition, the use of pure PGP
for the removal of Cr(VI) ions was also studied. As depicted in Figure 3b, the pure PGP showed
low adsorption capacity (20.6 mg/g) as compared with the amine-functionalized
PGP gel (e.g., 173.3 mg/g for PGP-NH2 sample). This is
possibly because of the negatively charged characteristic of PGP and
the absence of effective functional groups to capture Cr(VI) ions.
On the other hand, the adsorption capacity of amine-functionalized
PGP gel enhanced obviously with the increase of the fwt value which is associated with the content of amine
groups. This result demonstrated that the high adsorption capacity
of amine-functionalized PGP gel toward Cr(VI) ions is attributed to
the introduction of amine groups. Considering the cost and adsorption
capacity together, the optimal fwt value
was found to be 1.39 corresponding to the sample of PGP-NH2 gel.

In addition, the morphology of PGP-NH2 gel
after the
adsorption of Cr(VI) ions was characterized by SEM, as shown in Figure 4. The presence of
the N element further confirms the successful introduction of amine
groups. The strong Cr element signal suggests that the Cr(VI) ions
were successfully adsorbed by the PGP-NH2 gel (Figure 4e). The corresponding
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis spectrum in Figure 4f further demonstrated that
the PGP-NH2 gel possess excellent adsorption capability
toward Cr(VI) ions. The content of Cr(VI) ions was calculated to be
168.56 mg/g according to the EDX result, which is well in accordance
with the result measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (176.6
mg/g).

(e) mapping images of PGP-NH2 gel after adsorption of Cr(VI)
ions. (f) EDX spectrum of Cr(VI) ion-adsorbed PGP-NH2 gel

Effects of Solution pH
and Ionic Strength
The solution
pH is a very crucial parameter that can affect the removal performance
of the adsorbent toward Cr(VI) ions.39−41 On one hand, the variation
of solution pH may cause the change of protonation degree of the amine
groups associated with the surface charge of PGP-NH2 gel
adsorbent. On the other hand, the change of solution pH can also influence
the forms of Cr(VI) ions in water. It was reported that the Cr(VI)
ions are mainly in the form of Cr2O72–, HCrO4–, and CrO42– ions in water depending on the solution pH (see eqs 1 and 2).8 At very acidic condition (e.g., pH in the range
of 2–6), HCrO4– and Cr2O72– ions are the predominant forms.
When the pH was higher than 6, the main form becomes CrO42– ions. 1   2  

Herein, the influence of solution pH
on the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions by PGP-NH2 gel was investigated
at room temperature. As presented in Figure 5a, the adsorption capacity of PGP-NH2 gel gradually enhanced with the decline of solution pH. For
example, the adsorption capacities of PGP-NH2 gel at pH
of 2.0 and 9.0 were 173.6 and 52.8 mg/g, respectively. Other reported
adsorbents with a positively charged surface showed a similar trend
for the adsorption capacity with the increase of the solution pH.40−42 This is because the amine groups can endow the PGP-NH2 gel with much more positively charged binding sites at low pH. The
electrostatic attraction between the Cr(VI) ions (e.g., HCrO4– and Cr2O72– ions) and the amine groups of PGP-NH2 gel enhanced, leading
to a significant enhancement of the adsorption capacity. With increasing
solution pH (e.g., >6), the surface of the PGP-NH2 gel
becomes less positively charged. In addition, increasing the concentration
of OH– ions can cause competitive adsorption with
Cr(VI) ions (e.g., CrO42– ions). On the
basis of the above results, we can conclude that the adsorption of
Cr(VI) ions by PGP-NH2 gel is mainly ascribed to the electrostatic
attraction between the negatively charged Cr(VI) ions and the positively
charged amine groups.

Figure 5 Effects of solution pH (a) and NaCl concentration (b)
on the removal
of Cr(VI) ions by PGP-NH2 gel (C0 = 1000 mg/L). The contact time is 2 h.

Considering that the industrial effluents generally contain
various
salts, the effect of ionic strength on the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions
by PGP-NH2 gel was also studied. It was reported that high
ionic strength could affect the adsorption process because the salt
ions could compete with Cr(VI) ions.43 Herein,
NaCl was chosen as a representative salt. Obviously, the adsorption
capacity of PGP-NH2 gel gradually declined from 173.6 to
132.4 mg/g with raising the concentration of NaCl from 0 to 1.0 M
(Figure 5b). The adverse
effect of ionic strength on the uptake of Cr(VI) ions is possibly
attributed to the presence of ion exchange during the adsorption process.
With the enhancement of ion strength, both the number of binding sites
and the active Cr(VI) ions decreased. Under this circumstance, the
electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged Cr(VI) ions
and the positively charged amine groups becomes much weak, and thus
inhibited the uptake of Cr(VI) ions by PGP-NH2 gel. Nevertheless,
the adsorption capacity of the PGP-NH2 gel at high ionic
strength remains high enough for using as an adsorbent to remove Cr(VI)
ions from wastewater.

Adsorption Kinetics and Isotherms
For practical adsorption
application, the adsorption rate is a crucial factor. In this study,
the effect of contact time on the removal of Cr(VI) ions by PGP-NH2 gel was evaluated with the initial Cr(VI) ion concentration
of 1000 mg/L at room temperature and at pH 2.0. The PGP-NH2 gel showed fast adsorption rate toward Cr(VI) ions in the first
20 min, and the adsorption process gradually reached equilibrium within
about 40 min (Figure 6a). Such a high adsorption rate is possibly ascribed to the presence
of strong electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged
Cr(VI) ions and the positively charged PGP-NH2 gel. To
gain insights into the adsorption mechanism, three well-known kinetic
models including pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle
diffusion kinetic models were chosen to analyze the adsorption data
(Figures 6a and S2
in the Supporting Information).44−47 The kinetic parameters were calculated based on the slope and intercept
values of the corresponding fitting plot. As presented in Table 1, the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model exhibited the highest correlated coefficient value (R2 = 0.9971) as compared with that of pseudo-first-order
(R2 = 0.9411) and intraparticle diffusion
(R2 = 0.7288) kinetic models. Meanwhile,
the calculated Qe value (182.48 mg/g)
according to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was close to the
experimental Qe value (173.6 mg/g). All
of these fitting results indicate that the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model can be employed to describe the adsorption process. In addition,
the fitting plot according to the intraparticle diffusion model does
not pass the origin, indicating that the intraparticle diffusion was
not the rate-controlling factor.47 However,
the fitting plot of the intraparticle diffusion kinetic model exhibits
two obvious linear ranges (Figure S2c in the Supporting Information), which were caused by the surface adsorption and
intraparticle diffusion, respectively.

models (C0 = 1000 mg/L, pH = 2.0). (b)

To further probe the
interaction between the PGP-NH2 gel and the Cr(VI) ions,
the effect of initial concentration of
Cr(VI) ions on the adsorption performance of PGP-NH2 gel
was studied. As shown in Figure 6b, the PGP-NH2 gel exhibited high adsorption
capacity at higher concentration of Cr(VI) ions. This is attributed
to the factor that the higher concentration of Cr(VI) ions can offer
stronger driving force to overcome the mass transfer resistance of
Cr(VI) ions from water to the adsorbent phase. Because the adsorption
isotherm can provide useful information on the adsorption mechanism
and the adsorption properties of the adsorbent, three famous adsorption
isotherm models including Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherm
models were employed to fit the adsorption data (Figures 6b and S3 in the Supporting Information).48−51

Table 2 presents
the values of isotherm parameters obtained from the fitting results.
Obviously, the Langmuir isotherm was the best one to fit the adsorption
data based on its high R2 value (0.9986)
as compared with that of Freundlich isotherm (R2 = 0.8894) and Temkin isotherm (R2 = 0.9677). This result suggests that a monomolecular layer was formed
on the surface of PGP-NH2 gel, and the surface binding
sites were homogeneous with identical adsorption energy. On the basis
of the fitting result of Langmuir isotherm model, the maximum adsorption
capacity (Qm) of the PGP-NH2 gel toward Cr(VI) ions was calculated to be 188.32 mg/g, which is
much higher than many reported biomass-based adsorbents, such as amino
starch (12.12 mg/g),14 guar gum–ZnO
nanocomposite (55.56 mg/g),16 fungal biomass
(119.2 mg/g),22 chitosan-based hydrogel
(73.14 mg/g),41 and chitosan–Fe(III)
complex (173.1 mg/g)52 (see Table 3).

Adsorption Thermodynamics
The effect of temperature
on the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions by the PGP-NH2 gel was
also studied at 279, 293, and 313 K. As shown in Figure 7a, the adsorption capacity
of PGP-NH2 gel toward Cr(VI) ions enhanced with the raising
environmental temperature, suggesting the endothermic characteristic
of the adsorption process. To gain more information on the thermodynamic
parameters, van’t Hoff equation was employed to analyze the
adsorption data as follows53,54 3  where Qe (mg/g)
is the amount of Cr(VI) ions adsorbed by PGP-NH2 gel, Ce (mg/L) is the residual concentration of Cr(VI)
ions in water, ΔS (J mol–1 K–1) is change of entropy, R (8.314
J mol–1 K–1) is the ideal gas
constant, ΔH (kJ mol–1) is
the change of enthalpy, and T (K) is the Kelvin temperature.
To probe the spontaneous property of this adsorption process, the
variation of Gibbs free energy (ΔG, kJ mol–1) was calculated according to the following equation 4  

Figure 7 (a) Adsorption capacities
of PGP-NH2 gel toward Cr(VI)
ions at different temperatures (C0 = 1000
mg/L, pH = 2). (b) Plots of ln Qe/Ce against 1/T for the adsorption
of Cr(VI) ions onto the PGP-NH2 gel.

As shown in Figure 7b, the linear fitting plot of ln(Qe/Ce) against 1/T gives
the R2 value of 0.9936, indicating that
the adsorption
data can be well-fitted by eq 7. The positive values of ΔS and ΔH in Table 4 suggest that the adsorption of Cr(VI) ions by PGP-NH2 gel is a randomness increase and an endothermic process. Moreover,
the negative value of ΔG demonstrates the spontaneous
characteristic of the Cr(VI) ions adsorption process by PGP-NH2 gel.

Desorption and Regeneration Study
Considering practical
Cr(VI) ion adsorption applications, the adsorbent with superior desorption
and regeneration capability is highly desired not only for reducing
the cost of water treatment but also for recycling the chromium resource.
Because the PGP-NH2 gel exhibited very low adsorption capacity
at high pH, the desorption of Cr(VI) ion-adsorbed PGP-NH2 gel was conducted in NaOH solution (0.1 M). After desorption, the
PGP-NH2 gel was reused to adsorb Cr(VI) ions again, and
five consecutive cycles of desorption–adsorption were performed.
As expected, the PGP-NH2 gel exhibited favorable desorption
performance in alkaline solution and over 80% of adsorbed Cr(VI) ions
could be desorbed even after five cycles of adsorption–desorption
(Figure 8). Meanwhile,
the removal efficiency of desorbed PGP-NH2 gel gradually
declined with increasing the desorption times. For instance, 76.8%
of the removal efficiency was retained after five consecutive cycles
of desorption–adsorption as compared with the original removal
efficiency. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity of regenerated PGP-NH2 gel can still reach 135.52 mg/g, which is higher than many
reported biomass-based adsorbents (Table 3). On the basis of the above results, the
PGP-NH2 gel not only possesses excellent adsorption performance
but also shows superior reusability for the removal of Cr(VI) ions
from water.

after five cycles of desorption–adsorption.

Adsorption Mechanism Study
Because
the XPS spectrum
can provide useful information to identify the valence state of element,
the Cr(VI) ion-adsorbed PGP-NH2 gel was characterized by
XPS. As shown in Figure 9a, two obvious peaks at around 576.9 and 586.6 eV, respectively,
associated with Cr 2p3/2 and Cr 2p1/2 peaks
could be observed in the XPS survey spectrum, indicating the existence
of Cr(III) ion in the sample. Moreover, both the Cr 2p3/2 peak and the Cr 2p1/2 peak could be fitted by two peaks
corresponding to Cr(VI) and Cr(III) ions (Figure 9b), respectively, further confirming that
a part of the adsorbed Cr(VI) ions have been reduced into Cr(III)
ions.55

Figure 9 XPS survey (a) and XPS Cr 2p (b) spectra
of PGP-NH2 gel
after adsorption of Cr(VI) ions.

The studies on the adsorption performance of PGP-NH2 gel at diverse pH values and its desorption behavior suggest that
the electrostatic attraction plays a crucial role in capturing negatively
charged Cr(VI) ions from water (Scheme 2). In addition, the decrease of the adsorption capacity
at high ionic strength and the incomplete desorption of Cr(VI) ions
from PGP-NH2 gel in alkaline solution indicated the presence
of other affinity interactions such as ion exchange, hydrogen bonding,
and van der Waals force during the adsorption process.56 On the basis of the overall adsorption results,
we deduce that the adsorption process of Cr(VI) by the PGP-NH2 gel takes place as follow: first, negatively charged Cr(VI)
ions with different forms (e.g., Cr2O72–, HCrO4–, and CrO42– ions) in water were captured by the positively charged surface of
PGP-NH2 gel mainly through electrostatic attraction (Scheme 2). The surface Cr(VI)
ions may be forced into the internal of PGP-NH2 gel by
concentration gradient force. Then, the adsorbed Cr(VI) ions were
fixed by electrostatic attraction and other affinity interactions
such as hydrogen bonding and van der Waals force. Meanwhile, a part
of Cr(VI) ions were reduced into Cr(III) ions and separated from the
water phase.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the
PGP-NH2 gel
with multiple amine groups could be utilized as an outstanding adsorbent
for the removal of toxic Cr(VI) ions from the aqueous solution. The
PGP-NH2 gel exhibited fast adsorption rate and high removal
efficiency toward Cr(VI) ions, especially with the low initial concentration
of Cr(VI) ions. A detailed adsorption study indicates that the adsorption
process was spontaneous and endothermic and could be well-fitted by
pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. The maximum
adsorption capacity of the PGP-NH2 gel can reach 188.32
mg/g. The high reusability of the PGP-NH2 gel was also
confirmed by five cycles of desorption–adsorption. Adsorption
mechanism study suggests that the main driving force for capturing
Cr(VI) ions is the electrostatic attraction. Other interactions such
as ion exchange, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals force are also
involved during the adsorption process. Therefore, this work presents
a viable strategy to fabricate superior adsorbent from low-cost natural
biomass for treating Cr(VI) ion-containing wastewater.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Crude peach gum was obtained from the peach
trees at Guilin University of Technology (Guilin, China). Water-soluble
PGP was fabricated by the hydrolysis of crude peach gum according
to our previous report.27 DEA (97%), epichlorohydrin
(99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF,
≥99.5%), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, ≥99.8%), diphenyl carbazide (DPCA), sulfuric acid
(H2SO4, 95–98%), phosphoric acid (H3PO4, ≥85%), sodium chloride (NaCl, 99%),
hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 25–28%), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥96%)
were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Co. Ltd. (Shanghai China). Deionized
water was used throughout the experiment.

Synthesis of PGP-NH2 Gel Adsorbent
Typically,
the mixture of PGP (1.52 g), epichlorohydrin (3.94 g), and DMF (30
mL) was stirred at 95 °C for 90 min in a flask. After reaction,
the unreacted epichlorohydrin was removed by precipitation in acetone.
The obtained sediment and DEA (2.2 mL) were mixed in DMF (30 mL).
After stirring at 90 °C for 2 h, the mixture was filtrated. The
resulted solids were washed repeatedly with water and then were freeze-dried
to afford PGP-NH2 gel. The swelling ratio of PGP-NH2 gel was determined based on the following equation 5  where Wd and Ws are the weight of dried PGP-NH2 sample before and after immersing in water, respectively.

Batch
Adsorption Experiments
Before adsorption experiments,
a stock solution of Cr(VI) ions with the concentration of 2000 mg/L
was prepared by dissolving 2.0 g of K2Cr2O7 in 1.0 L of water. The concentration of Cr(VI) ions after
adsorption was determined by a UV–vis spectrophotometer using
the standard DPCA method.57 The pink complex
solution formed between DPCA and Cr(VI) ions was determined at 540
nm. Before adsorption, the calibration curve was plotted. Typically,
50 mg of PGP-NH2 gel was added into 10 mL of Cr(VI) ions
solution with specific concentration, and the mixture was shaken at
certain temperature for 120 min. The concentration of Cr(VI) ions
after adsorption was determined by the UV–vis spectrophotometer.
HCl (0.5 M) and NaOH (0.1 M) were used to adjust the solution pH.
The effect of initial concentration of Cr(VI) ions on the adsorption
performance of PGP-NH2 gel was investigated by diluting
the stock solution with water. The removal efficiency of PGP-NH2 gel toward Cr(VI) ions was calculated by the following equation 6  

The adsorption capacity of PGP-NH2 gel adsorbent
at time t (Qt) and equilibrium (Qe) were calculated
from the following equations 7   8  where C0 (mg/L)
is the initial concentration of Cr(VI) ions; Ct (mg/L) and Ce (mg/L) are the concentrations of Cr(VI) ions at time t and equilibrium, respectively; Qt (mg/g) and Qe (mg/g) are the adsorption
capacities of PGP-NH2 gel at time t (min)
and equilibrium, respectively; V (L) is the volume
of the solution; and m (g) is the mass of PGP-NH2 gel.
