Human carbonic anhydrase
II (HCA II) is an enzyme that catalyzes
the reversible hydration of CO2 into bicarbonate (HCO3–) and a proton (H+) as well
as other reactions at an extremely high rate. This enzyme plays fundamental
roles in human physiology/pathology, such as controlling the pH level
in cells and so on. However, the binding mechanism between apo-HCA
II and CO2 or other ligands as well as related conformational
changes remains poorly understood, and atomic investigation into it
could promote our understanding of related internal physiological/pathological
mechanisms. In this study, long-time atomic molecular dynamics simulations
as well as the clustering and free-energy analysis were performed
to reveal the dynamics of apo-HCA II as well as the mechanism upon
ligand binding. Our simulations indicate that the crystallographic
B-factors considerably underestimate the loop dynamics: multiple conformations
can be adopted by loops 1 and 2, especially for loop 1 because loop
1 is one side of the binding pocket, and its left-to-right movement
can compress or extend the binding pocket, leading to one inactive
(closed) state, three intermediate (semiopen) states, and one active
(open) state; CO2 cannot get into the binding pocket of
the inactive state but can get into those of intermediate and active
states. The coexistence of multiple conformational states proposes
a possible conformational selection model for the binding mechanism
between apo-HCA II and CO2 or other ligands, revising our
previous view of its functional mechanism of conformational change
upon ligand binding and offering valuable structural insights into
the workings of HCA II.

Introduction
Enzymes, or proteins
in general, are not static and can adopt multiple
conformations, as demonstrated in three-dimensional atomic detail
by the observation of structures of the same enzyme in different liganded
states through X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) or even by the multiple conformational equilibria of an enzyme
in the same liganded state revealed by NMR.1,2 It
is well-known that these multiple conformational transitions are essential
for ligand binding because of the conflicting structural requirements:
an unbound enzyme must adopt an open conformation to allow its substrate
to enter its active site to form a Michaelis complex; subsequently,
to maximize transition state stabilization and prevent side reactions,
the enzyme typically assumes a closed conformation, such that the
substrate is buried in its active site; after the chemical reaction,
the enzyme must again open up its active site to allow the product
to exit.3 However, how a protein could
transit from an unbound conformation to a bound conformation in a
complex with a ligand, or specifically, whether an unbound enzyme
can undergo large conformational changes and assume bound as well
as other multiple conformations remains unknown.4−7 Insights into it will promote
our understanding of protein–ligand binding, which is critical
to molecular recognition as well as the drug design.8

Human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II) has been long
known as an
enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2 into
bicarbonate (HCO3–) and a proton (H+) at an extremely high rate,9−13 but its catalytic activity is not limited to the
hydration of CO2: it is reported that HCA II can also catalyze
the hydrolysis of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene14 and sulfonyl chlorides15 as well as the
hydration of cyanamide to urea.16 This
enzyme plays fundamental roles in human physiology/pathology: it is
essential in keeping the adequate balance between carbon dioxide and
bicarbonate, thus controlling the pH level in cells, and is vital
to a variety of biological processes, such as vision,17 development, and function of bone,18 calcification,18 and so forth. As a cytosolic
and monomeric protein with a small molecular weight of 30 kDa but
multifunctions,9 it is often used as a
prototypical model system for biophysical studies9,13 and
medicinal chemistry applications.13,19 The 15 Å
deep conical binding pocket20 (illustrated
in Figure 1) is formed
with 10-stranded β-sheets on one side,21 and on the other side, with the active site loop of residues 197–206
(loop 1), which has been identified to be important for ligand binding,22 especially Leu198, Thr199, and His200, which
have direct contact and form hydrogen bonds with ligands;22−25 at the bottom of the pocket, a Zn2+ ion is tetrahedrally
coordinated with three histidine residues (His94, 96, and 119) and
a bound water/hydroxyl (H2O/OH–).26 Another loop related to ligand binding is the
surface loop of residues 230–240 (loop 2), which can control
the size of the entrance of the binding pocket.

Figure 1 The crystal structure
of apo-HCA II (PDB entry 3KS3). The zinc ions
are colored orange, the loops 1 and 2 are highlighted in red, whereas
residues 68, 202 and 235 are marked in green. His94, Val143, Leu198,
Thr199, and Val207 are displayed as the licorice style.

The flexibility of the two loops in the apo form
of the enzyme
is evidenced by their higher B-factors in the crystal structure; however,
in the crystal structure, the flexibility is always greatly hindered
by crystal contacts between adjacent copies and lower cryogenic temperature;27−29 more importantly, the detail of their conformational changes cannot
be revealed either. The conformational changes of the two loops could
impact the ligand binding of the enzyme, especially for loop 1, although
its B-factor values are not as large as those of loop 2, even a tiny
conformational change of this loop could change the volume of the
binding pocket as well as the hydrogen-bond network, which is critical
to ligand binding and catalytic reactions. Therefore, in our work,
conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations totaling 1 μs
at room temperature (300 K) were applied to research the conformational
transitions of apo-HCA II. Our simulations revealed multiple conformations
of loops 1 and 2, including the open, semiopen, and closed conformations,
thereby revising our previous view of the functional mechanism of
conformational change upon CO2 or other ligand binding.

Results
Stability
of the MD Trajectories
Because a stable protein
structure was essential to our analysis, the root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) values were evaluated for all MD trajectories. The average
rmsd value from the initial structure calculated using all Cα atoms is ∼2 Å (Figure 2a), indicating that the protein was stable during each
of the 200 ns MD simulations. As measured by the B-factor values calculated
for the MD trajectories (Figure 2b), loop 2 is one of the most flexible regions with
its MD B-factors larger than 100 Å2; loop 1 also has
a peak of MD B-factor values, revealing some large conformational
change on it which, although higher than experimental values as expected
(crystal contacts between adjacent copies and lower cryogenic temperature
as mentioned in the Introduction section),
is still well-consistent. In the simulations, the residues with the
highest B-factor values in loops 1 and 2 were Pro202 and Gly235, respectively;
correspondingly, Val68 is located at the edge of the protein cavity
and has little mobility. Therefore, the distance between Pro202 and
Val68 can be used to represent the motion of loop 1 and its opening
or closing; likewise, the distance between Gly235 and Val68 can reflect
the motion of loop 2 (see Figure 1).

the MD simulations
and (b) the B-factor distributions derived from the MD simulations
and the crystal structure.

Clustering and Conformational Network Analysis for the Trajectories
To map out the conformational states and transitions of loops 1
and 2, clustering and conformational network analyses were performed
on the conformations of the two loops in the simulations, which is
depicted in Figure 3. Five clusters are extracted from the MD simulations, and in them,
multiple conformations of loops 1 and 2 are observed (Figure 3a); especially for loop 1,
even though its B-factors are not as large as loop 2, loop 1 is one
side of the binding pocket and so its movement can directly compress
or extend the binding pocket, representing closed (clusters 2), semiopen
(clusters 1, 3, and 4), as well as open conformations (cluster 5)
of the binding pocket. For loop 2, although its B-factors are larger
than loop 1, its conformations are open (clusters 1, 2, 3, and 5)
or even superopen (cluster 4), keeping the entrance of the binding
pocket always large enough for ligands.

(DRMS)-based clustering and network analysis
of the MD simulations: (a) center structures of the clusters, (b)
time evolution of the clusters, and (c) distribution and interconversion
network of the clusters. In panel b, the different clusters are represented
by different colors. In panel c, the relative populations of the clusters
are indicated by percentage values, and the thickness of each connecting
line is proportional to the corresponding frequency of interconversion.

Figure 3b shows
the time series of the cluster assignments for the five trajectories.
Although all trajectories start with the same initial structure belonging
to cluster 1, the observed cluster types are different in different
trajectories, which means that different trajectories have different
conformational spaces. Clusters 1 and 2 are all included in the five
trajectories, representing the broad observation of the transitions
between closed and semiopen conformations of loop 1, as well as that
between open and superopen conformations of loop 2; except trajectory
2, cluster 3 is present in the other four trajectories; the most dramatic
conformational transitions of the two loops occur in trajectories
3 and 5, in which all the five clusters are present, which leads to
multiple transitions between closed, semiopen, and open conformations
of loop 1.

The occurrence percentages of these clusters and
the conformational
space network among them are shown in Figure 3c. Clusters 1 and 2 are dominant, with the
percentages up to 45.2 and 53.4%, respectively; the other three clusters
totally occupy only 1.4%. From the conformational space network, one
can observe that cluster 4 is a key intermediate state: first, it
provides another way from cluster 1 to 2 or vice versa; more importantly,
cluster 5 connects only to cluster 4; therefore, only through cluster
4, cluster 5 can be reached by clusters 1 and 2. Because loop 1 is
closed in cluster 2 while open in cluster 5, with loop 1 semiopen,
cluster 4 is the intermediate state between closed and open conformations
of loop 1. Another interesting cluster is cluster 3: it only has direct
transitions from or to cluster 2.

To precisely determine which
conformations in our simulations are
accessible to CO2 and other ligands, the experimental structure
of CO2-bound HCA II (PDB entry 5DSO) and the multiple conformations of apo-HCA
II from our MD simulations are aligned. As shown in Figure 4, in the closed conformations
of loop 1 (Figure 4a), the entrance to the binding pocket is partially blocked, and
the binding pocket is also too small to accommodate even the smallest
ligand–CO2, and detailed investigation revealed
that the binding pocket is occupied by His94, Val143, Leu198, Thr199,
and Val207 (See Figure 1); in the semiopen conformations of loop 1, the entrance and the
binding pocket are enough for CO2 entering and binding;
in the open conformations, the entrance and the binding pocket are
even larger, provide a possibility to accommodate and catalyze larger
ligands, such as 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, sulfonyl chlorides,
and cyanamide. Therefore, the five clusters can be identified as one
inactive state (cluster 2), three intermediate states (clusters 1,
3, and 4), and one active state (cluster 5) with their percentages
53.4, 46.1, and 0.5% (see Figure 3c), which means that about one-half of the conformations
from our simulations are accessible to CO2, whereas the
other half are not.

HCA II (PDB entry 5DSO) and the multiple conformations of apo-HCA II from our MD simulations:

experimental structure of the protein hidden, the graphs show the
relative positions of bounded CO2 and the multiple conformations
from our MD simulations. The CO2 molecule is displayed
as three connected spheres with the C atom in green and the two O
atoms in red, and the conformations from our simulations are in “surface”
view.

The Free-Energy Landscape
of Loop 1
As loop 1 is critical
to ligand binding to HCA II, its two-dimensional free energy was estimated
from our MD simulations and is shown in Figure 5. The Cα distance between
Pro202 and Val68 was chosen as the x-coordinate,
whereas the rmsd of loop 1 to the initial structure (PDB entry 3KS3) was chosen as the y-coordinate. The reason for such a choice is that the Cα distance between Pro202 and Val68 can reasonably discriminate
different conformations (closed, semiopen, open) of loop 1, whereas
the rmsd of loop 1 represents its conformational changes. Points representative
of the central conformations of the five clusters are also shown in
the graphs.

Figure 5 Two-dimensional free energy for loop 1 from the MD simulations.
The x axis represents the Cα distance
between Pro202 and Val68, whereas the y axis represents
the rmsd of loop 2 to the initial structure (PDB entry 3KS3). Points representative
of the central conformations of the five clusters are also shown in
the graphs.

In Figure 5, clusters
1 and 2 are located at the area with lower free energies, which are
consistent with those of Figure 3c; they have the largest populations. Cluster 4 is
just between cluster 5 and cluster 1 or 2, thus agreeing well also
with that of Figure 3c. Cluster 4 is a key intermediate state between closed and open
conformations of loop 1 because the representative point of cluster
1 is closer to that of cluster 4 than cluster 2; just as shown in Figure 3c the transitions
between cluster 1 and cluster 4 are more frequent than those between
cluster 2 and cluster 4. Estimated from this figure, the free-energy
difference between closed and open conformations of loop 1 is about
6.75–3.75 = 3 kcal/mol.

Principal Component Analysis
In our principal component
analysis (PCA), all Cα atoms are used to define the
backbone conformation of HCA II, resulting in 771 principal components
from the 257 Cα atoms in the form of 771 eigenvectors
and their associated eigenvalues. The validation of the PCA is certified
in the Supporting Information (Table S1). Figure S2 shows that, consistent with earlier
research,30 30 out of the 771 PCs (principal
components) capture approximately 80% of the protein’s motion.
The first three PCs, in particular, have much larger eigenvalues than
the rest, and in every trajectory, they capture about 50% of the motion
(see Figure S2). Hence, the first three
PCs are sufficient for the analysis.

Figure 6 shows the vector-field representations of
the PCs obtained from the combined data of all trajectories. The figure
clearly shows that loops 1 and 2 have one of the largest motions of
the protein, which is well-consistent with the B-factor graphs. From
the figure, one can observe that, in the first three PCs, both loops
1 and 2 always move from left to right or vice versa; however, the
consequences are quite different because loop 1 is one side the binding
pocket, and such a movement can compress or extend the binding pocket;
but for loop 2, it is a loop on the surface, and such a movement has
little impact on the binding pocket. This is why loop 1 has closed,
semiopen, and open conformations, but loop 2 has only open or superopen
conformations.

Discussion
The Dynamics
of Loops 1 and 2 of Apo-HCA II Revealed by the
MD Simulations
HCA II catalyzes the reversible hydration
of CO2 into HCO3– and a H+ at an extremely high rate, thus playing very fundamental
roles in human physiology/pathology, such as controlling the pH level
in cells. Besides that, HCA II can also catalyze the hydrolysis of
1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and sulfonyl chlorides as well as the
hydration of cyanamide to urea. Atomic investigation into this enzyme
will promote our understanding of related internal physiological/pathological
mechanisms.

In this study, long time (1 μs) atomic MD
simulations of apo-HCA II as well as the clustering and free-energy
analyses were reported, which has provided novel insights into the
dynamics of apo-HCA II as well as the mechanism upon ligand binding.
Multiple conformations of loops 1 and 2 can be observed in our MD
simulations especially for loop 1 because loop 1 is one side of the
binding pocket, and its left-to-right movement can compress or extend
the binding pocket, leading to one inactive state (cluster 2 with
loop 1 closed), three intermediate states semiopen (clusters 1, 3,
and 4, with loop 1 semiopen), and one active state (cluster 5 with
loop 1 open); both the intermediate and active states are accessible
to CO2, the active state can accommodate large ligands.
Loop 2 is a surface loop, so although it has larger B-factors than
loop 1, its left-to-right movement can represent only open or even
superopen conformations, never blocking the entrance to the binding
pocket.

“Induced Fit” versus “Conformational Selection”
At present, two different models, which are generally referred
to as “induced fit (IF)” and “conformational
selection (CS)”, have been proposed to describe the conformational
changes that occur upon ligand binding.31−33 The IF model34 presumes that the binding of the ligand may
induce a conformational change in the receipt or enzyme, resulting
in an optimized geometry that exists only in the complex state. In
this scenario, the protein energy landscape changes upon the binding
of the ligand. By contrast, the CS model presumes that more than one
structural conformation pre-exists in conformational equilibrium before
ligand binding.35−37 This model involves the stabilization of an accessible
conformation, and the ligand binding causes a shift in the pre-existing
conformational equilibrium. It is important to note that these two
models are not mutually exclusive; a survey of the recent literature
indicates that many processes can simultaneously include certain elements
of both the IF and CS models.32,33,38−41

In our simulation, inactive, intermediate, as well as active
states coexist, and CO2 can easily get into the binding
pocket of the active state but cannot get into the pocket of the inactive
states; the ratio between CO2 accessible and inaccessible
conformations is about 1:1. The longest continuous periods of CO2 accessible and CO2 inaccessible conformations
are all about 20% of total simulation time (see Figure 3b). Therefore, for the apo form of HCA II,
the lasting time of CO2 accessible conformations is long
enough for its entry, but the lasting time of CO2 accessible
conformations is also not short, and CO2 must “select”
a right time to enter HCA II and bind. In other words, the conformational
changes of apo-HCA II upon ligand binding favor the CS model as the
conformation of the loop 1 is variable, and its open conformations
can exist prior to antibiotics binding; when the loop 1 is semiopen
or open, antibiotics enter and bind to HCA II; when loop 1 is closed,
such an entry is forbidden. The situation for larger ligands is similar,
but the lasting time of their accessible conformations is shorter.
However, in this process, the entry of CO2 can also induce
minor a conformational change of HCA II, so there will still be some
minor IF elements. Once CO2 enters the binding pocket,
loop 1 will close and compress the pocket so that CO2 is
buried into the active site, then the side chains of His119, Leu198,
Thr199, and Trp209 are attracted by CO2, rotated toward
and bound to CO2.

Methods
MD Simulations
The MD simulations were performed using
GROMACS 5.1.442,43 and the AMBER99sb-ildn force
field.44 The initial coordinates for the
MD simulations were taken from the crystal structure of apo-HCA II
with one Zn2+ ion and 9 crystal water molecules (PDB entry 3KS3; Figure 1).23 The protein molecule was placed in a cubic TIP3P water box,45 with the edges of the water box located at least
10 Å from the protein atoms. The system consisted of 4055 protein
atoms and 45 900 solvent atoms, neutralized by 2 Cl– ions under periodic boundary conditions. To remove potential bad
contacts, the initial model was subjected to two rounds of energy
minimization: first, 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by 1000
steps of conjugate gradient, with the protein atoms constrained by
a harmonic potential with a force constant of 100 kcal/mol, and then,
2000 steps of steepest descent and 3000 steps of conjugate gradient
without any constraints. Five 200 ns MD trajectories at 300 K with
different initial random velocities were obtained, resulting in a
total of 1 μs of simulation. In each trajectory, the system
was heated at constant volume from 0 to 300 K over 60 ps, and then,
a 5 ns equilibration MD simulation and a 200 ns production MD simulations
were run at constant temperature and pressure, with the temperature
maintained at the temperatures set by the velocity-rescale thermostat46 with a collision time of 0.2 ps and the pressure
maintained at 1.0 atm using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat47 with the coupling time of 2.0 ps. The long-range
electrostatic interaction is calculated by the particle-mesh Ewald
method48 with a real space cutoff of 10
Å; the cutoff distance of the van der Waals interaction is also
10 Å as well. All bonds involving hydrogen atoms were fixed to
their equilibrium values using the LINCS algorithm49 to allow a 2.0 fs time step. The MD trajectories were recorded
at 4 ps intervals.

Multiple Trajectories in the Simulations
In our simulations,
five 200 ns MD trajectories rather than a single 1000 ns trajectory
were generated. The benefits of this approach are as follows: first,
five shorter simulations with different initial velocities can more
efficiently cover the relevant basin in configuration space and minimize
force-field-induced artifacts;50 second,
the five trajectories can be run simultaneously, thereby saving time.

Conformational Clustering and Network Analysis
The
MD snapshots were clustered based on the DRMS using the leader algorithm
implemented in WORDOM.51,52 The DRMS between two structures
or snapshots (a and b) is defined as follows. 1  where dij is the distance between atoms i and j and N is the total number of pairs of
atoms. The DRMS was chosen for the conformational clustering because
it is sensitive to not only the conformations of individual loops
but also the conformational coupling of the loops. The backbone atoms
Cα, C, and N of the loops 1 and 2 (residues 197–206
in loop 1 and residues 230–240 in loop 2) were used for the
calculations. The DRMS cutoff for the conformational clustering was
1.5 Å. For the MD trajectories, each cluster was treated as a
node of a conformational network, with the node size proportional
to the number of snapshots in the cluster and the edge thickness proportional
to the number of direct transitions between two connected clusters.
The visual representations of the conformational networks were created
in Pajek.53

Principal Component Analysis
PCA was performed on the
Cα atoms using the “gmx covar” command
in GROMACS 5.1.4. The coordinates of each trajectory were superposed
by means of a least-squares fit using the first snapshot as a reference.
A covariance matrix of atomic fluctuations, C, was then
calculated, with each element, cij, for
a given pair of atoms defined as follows 2  where r1, r2, ..., r3N are the Cartesian coordinates of the
Cα atoms
and the angular brackets denote an ensemble average calculated from
all snapshots of the MD trajectory.54−57 Diagonalization of the covariance
matrix yielded the eigenvalues λi, that is, the diagonal elements of the diagonalized matrix, and
the eigenvectors Li,
that is, the columns of the orthonormal transformation matrix. These
eigenvectors are the principal modes of motion, and the eigenvalues
are the mean-square fluctuations along the eigenvector coordinates.
PCA is not restricted to harmonic motions; it can also describe collective
transitions between structures that differ greatly.

The percentage vi of the total variance contained
in a given eigenvector Li is given by 3  where vi measures the contribution of a given
PC to the overall protein
fluctuations. The cumulative contribution from a set of PCs is 4  

Typically, the first few PCs
capture most of the intramolecular
fluctuation of a protein.30,57−63
