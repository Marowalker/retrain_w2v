The self-heating effect is a severe
issue for high-power semiconductor
devices, which degrades the electron mobility and saturation velocity,
and also affects the device reliability. On applying an ultrafast
and high-resolution thermoreflectance imaging technique, the direct
self-heating effect and surface temperature increase phenomenon are
observed on novel top-gate β-Ga2O3 on
insulator field-effect transistors. Here, we demonstrate that by utilizing
a higher thermal conductivity sapphire substrate rather than a SiO2/Si substrate, the temperature rise above room temperature
of β-Ga2O3 on the insulator field-effect
transistor can be reduced by a factor of 3 and thereby the self-heating
effect is significantly reduced. Both thermoreflectance characterization
and simulation verify that the thermal resistance on the sapphire
substrate is less than 1/3 of that on the SiO2/Si substrate.
Therefore, maximum drain current density of 535 mA/mm is achieved
on the sapphire substrate, which is 70% higher than that on the SiO2/Si substrate due to reduced self-heating. Integration of
β-Ga2O3 channel on a higher thermal conductivity
substrate opens a new route to address the low thermal conductivity
issue of β-Ga2O3 for power electronics
applications.

Introduction
The self-heating effect
(SHE)-induced temperature increase and
nonuniform distribution of dissipated power have emerged as one of
the most important concerns in the degradation of transistor’s
drain current (ID), output power density
(P), as well as the gate leakage current, device
variability, and reliability.1−5 This effect would become more severe in a high-power device with
a low thermal conductivity (κ) substrate such as β-Ga2O3. β-Ga2O3 as a newly
emerged semiconductor has an ultrawide band gap of 4.8 eV and a corresponding
high electrical breakdown field (Ebr)
of 8 MV/cm, being identified as the next generation wide band gap
semiconductor to replace GaN and SiC.6−9 In addition, the transferrable nanomembrane
property could also offer more functionalities for β-Ga2O3 by transferring on different substrates.7 However, the β-Ga2O3 bulk substrate generally suffers from low κ of 10–25
W/(m·K) and thus severe SHE,10,11 which becomes
one of the major challenges for realizing practical applications.
An effective approach to mitigate the SHE of β-Ga2O3 field-effect transistors (FETs) is to utilize a higher
κ substrate rather than the β-Ga2O3 native substrate through a potential wafer bonding technique. In
our previous work, we have demonstrated high-performance back-gate
β-Ga2O3 on insulator (GOOI) FETs by transferring
β-Ga2O3 nanomembranes or nanobelts to
a SiO2/Si substrate with 300 nm SiO2 as the
gate voltage blocking layer and a Si substrate as the thermal conductor.12,13 A unique property of β-Ga2O3 is its
large lattice constant of 12.23 Å along [100] direction, which
allows a facile cleavage into the nanomembrane along this [100] direction.
Therefore, thin-film β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane
can be obtained by applying mechanical exfoliation, although β-Ga2O3 is not a van der Waals two-dimensional (2D)
material.12

Nowadays, a majority
of the GOOI FETs were fabricated on the SiO2/Si substrate
like most of the 2D devices, such as graphene,14 MoS2,15 and black
phosphorus;16 however, SiO2 has
a low room temperature κ of 1.5 W/(m·K). To
reduce the SHE of GOOI FET, a higher κ substrate is needed.
Although SiC has a high κ of 300 W/(m·K), it is not an
ideal substrate for β-Ga2O3 because of
its lower band gap of 3.3 eV and high cost.17 Diamond is a promising substrate for β-Ga2O3 with higher thermal conductivity, once its low-cost large-sized
substrates are available.6 Among these
commercial, large-sized, and wide band gap substrates, sapphire stands
out to be a promising candidate for GOOI FETs, because of its low-cost,
wide band gap of 8.8 eV, and medium κ of 40 W/(m·K),18 which is around 2–4 times of the bulk
β-Ga2O3 substrate and around 25 times
of SiO2. In this letter, we have used the sapphire substrate
as a thermal conductor for GOOI FETs to enhance the thermal dissipation
and boost the electrical device performance significantly. An ultrafast,
high-resolution thermoreflectance (TR) imaging technique is applied
to the top-gate GOOI FET to examine the reduced SHE and local surface
temperature increase (ΔT) above room temperature
on a sapphire substrate compared to that in a SiO2/Si substrate.
After replacing the SiO2/Si substrate with a sapphire substrate,
the top-gate GOOI FET has 70% higher maximum ID (IDmax), ∼
twice lower device surface ΔT, and twice lower
thermal resistance (RT).

Results and Discussion
β-Ga2O3 Materials and GOOI FETs
The experimental
device cross-sectional schematic of top-gate GOOI
FETs on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates is shown in Figure 1a,b, consisting of
a Ni/Au (30/50 nm) top-gate, 15 nm amorphous aluminum oxide (Al2O3) gate dielectric, 70–100 nm Sn-doped
(100) β-Ga2O3 channel with surface roughness
of 0.3 nm,19 and Ti/Al/Au (15/60/50 nm)
source/drain contacts. A 270 nm thick SiO2 is used as the
drain voltage blocking layer for top-gate GOOI FETs, and p++ Si is used as a thermal conductor for GOOI FET. The thickness of
the c-plane sapphire substrate is 650 μm, which
serves as the drain voltage blocking layer and thermal conductor due
to its wider band gap and higher κ compared to those of the
(100) β-Ga2O3 channel. The κ of
each material is also marked in Figure 1a,b for comparison. Figure 1c is the false-colored scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of a fabricated GOOI FET. The device has a
gate length (LG) of 1 μm and source
to drain spacing (LSD) of 6 μm to
allow high drain bias to generate enough heat for our TR study. This
TR imaging technique offers large-area imaging capability with higher
spatial resolution (submicron) compared to that of other optical thermal
characterization approaches, such as infrared (IR) thermography and
micro-Raman. The TR system also enables a high-resolution transient
temporal imaging to study the heating/cooling phase at submicrosecond
time scales.20,21

and Ni/Au (30/50 nm) is used as the gate electrode. (c) False-colored

1 μm and LSD = 6 μm.

I–V Electrical Characteristics
Figure 2a,b shows
the well-behaved direct-current (DC) output characteristics (ID–VDS) of
two top-gate GOOI FETs with LSD of 6/6.5
μm, LG of 1 μm, and channel
thickness of 73/75 nm on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates,
respectively. The typical range of physical width of nanomembrane
devices is 0.5–1.5 μm, determined by SEM, as shown in Figure 1c. The measurements
start from applying the top-gate bias (VGS) to 8 or 6 V and then stepping to the device pinch-off voltage of
−28 V with −2 V as a step, whereas the drain bias (VDS) is swept from 0 to 27 or 30 V for the SiO2/Si and sapphire substrate devices, respectively. IDmax of 535 and 325 mA/mm for sapphire
and SiO2/Si substrates are obtained, respectively; the IDmax on sapphire is the highest among
all DC values of all top-gate β-Ga2O3 MOSFETs.6−9,22,23 The IDmax of GOOI FET on
the sapphire substrate is around 1.7 times that on the SiO2/Si substrate, originating from better transport properties at a
lower device temperature. Figure 2c depicts the ID–VGS and gm–VGS of GOOI FETs on two substrates at VDS = 25 V. A similar on/off ratio of 109 and low subthreshold slope (SS) of 65 mV/dec are achieved
on both devices due to the wide band gap and high-quality atomic-layer-deposition
(ALD) Al2O3/β-Ga2O3 interface, yielding a low interface trap density (Dit) of 2.6 × 1011/eV·cm2 by the equation SS = 60 × (1 + qDit/Cox) mV/dec at room temperature, where Cox is the oxide capacitance. The slightly high
off-state current is due to the limitation of the lowest current level
the equipment setup can measure on small width devices. One interesting
phenomenon is that the peak gm of the
sapphire substrate is 21 mS/mm, which is 60% higher than the gm of the SiO2/Si substrate. The extrinsic
electron field-effect mobility (μFE) of GOOI FET
on sapphire and SiO2/Si are roughly extracted to be 30.2
and 21.7 cm2/(V·s), respectively, benefiting from
the less SHE on sapphire.24 More than 10
devices on 2 different substrates were fabricated and characterized.
Their mobilities were extracted with small standard deviations, which
confirms that the mobility on the sapphire substrate is higher and
the fabricated devices have high uniformity.

with a high on/off ratio of 109 and low SS of 65 mV/dec,
yielding a low Dit of 2.6 × 1011/eV·cm2. Higher gm shows higher electron μ on the sapphire substrate due to the
reduced device temperature.

Steady State TR Imaging
For power electronics applications
with large ID and VDS, the SHE must be taken into consideration. The power consumption
(P) of the active device can be simply estimated
as a product of ID and VDS; then, the heat generated in an active device is proportional
to the device power consumption. In a GOOI FET, the device serves
as the heat source and substrate acts as the heat sink for dissipation
of the device heat. Heat can also be dissipated through the top surface
by air convection and source–gate–drain metal pads.4 However, the heat transfer to the air is very
low, considering the low heat transfer coefficient h ∼ 10 W/(m2·K). A heat flux (F) of 4.6 × 10–10 W can be roughly estimated
by equation F = hAΔT, where A is the nanomembrane area of
1 μm × 11 μm and ΔT (43 K)
is the device temperature rise above room temperature while being
biased for TR measurement. This heat flux is negligible compared with
the device power consumption of P = ID × VDS = 30 V ×
540 mA/mm × 1 μm = 1.62 × 10–2 W,
which is mainly dissipated through the substrate. During the TR characterization,
the gate electrode metal Au is illuminated through a light-emitting
diode (LED) and the reflected signal is calibrated with Au TR coefficient
to translate into the increased temperature ΔT above room temperature. The gate Au electrode rather than source/drain
contacts is selected because source/drain contact regions have Al2O3 on top and the Ti/Al/Au are alloyed. Au directly
above the channel region defines the channel temperature, and the
Au temperature is marked as the channel temperature.

Figure 3a,b shows merged
optical and TR thermal image views of GOOI FETs on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates at steady state and different P conditions. The β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane
has a thickness of 100 and 80 nm on SiO2/Si and sapphire
substrates, respectively. The 20 nm nanomembrane difference in thickness
only contributes to a negligible thermal resistance of 2 × 10–6 mm2·K/W, which is less than 0.1%
of the total resistance. In this measurement, VGS is biased at 0 V, whereas VDS is swept from 0 to 27 V or 30 V for GOOI FETs on SiO2/Si and sapphire, respectively. During the TR measurement, the VDS modulation signal has a pulse width of 1
ms and 10% duty cycle. The 1 ms pulse is long enough to allow the
FET to reach the hot steady state during the high portion of the signal.
The probe optical pulse width was 100 μs, synchronized just
prior to the falling edge of the device excitation pulse to capture
the TR image at the end of the VDS pulse.
The ID is recorded at the same time to
calculate the normalized power density P = VDS × ID/A to avoid different heat dissipation areas from having
different sizes of the β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane.
The areas of β-Ga2O3 nanomembranes are
1.4 × 10–5 and 1.1 × 10–5 mm2 on SiO2/Si and sapphire, respectively.
As higher VDS is applied, the device is
heated up simultaneously and the corresponding ΔT is increased. At P = 717 W/mm2 on the
SiO2/Si substrate, the ΔT is measured
to be 106 K, whereas in contrast the ΔT is
just 43 K at a higher P = 917 W/mm2 on
the sapphire substrate. Figure 3c depicts the measured and simulated ΔT versus P for GOOI FETs on two substrates. For both
the measurement and simulation results, the clear observation is that
at the same P, the GOOI FET on the sapphire substrate
has more than twice lower ΔT compared to that
on SiO2/Si. The RT of sapphire
and SiO2/Si substrates are calculated to be 4.62 ×
10–2 and 1.47 × 10–1 mm2·K/W, respectively, through RT = ΔT/P. The reduced RT of GOOI FET on sapphire demonstrates that
a higher κ substrate can be more effective in dissipating the
heat on the devices. With less heat on the device, the temperature
is lower so that the μ is higher to achieve a potentially higher IDmax for a better device performance.
This substrate thermal engineering approach can also be applied to
other 2D FET research if heat dissipation is an issue.

GOOI FETs. TR and charge-coupled device (CCD) camera merged images

when device P is increased by increasing VDS at VGS = 0 V.
Results show the device heating at steady state, and significant SHE
is observed on GOOI FET on the SiO2/Si substrate at high P. (c) Measured and simulated local gate Au surface ΔT comparison between GOOI FET on sapphire and SiO2/Si substrates. Each error bar of measured data is from the standard
deviation of three devices on both substrates. The power density P = VDS × ID is normalized by the β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane area to avoid random shape-induced variations. The
ΔT of GOOI FET on the SiO2/Si substrate
is more than three times of that on the sapphire substrate at the
same P. As a result, the RT of GOOI FET on the sapphire substrate is 4.62 × 10–2 mm2·K/W, which is less than 1/3 of that on the SiO2/Si substrate.

Transient TR Imaging
Although there are well-established
methods to access the DC temperature of devices, there is as yet little
direct experimental information available on the device dynamics.
Such time-dependent information is particularly relevant for this
new device system β-Ga2O3. Understanding
of heat dissipation and thermal dynamics of the GOOI FETs is furthermore
important because pulse width modulation is commonly used to suppress
self-heating and improve efficiency in modern power applications.
Dynamic measurements help to reveal the surface temperature redistribution
and allow the device thermal time constant for both heating (τH) and cooling (τC) to be measured experimentally.
Measured thermal time constants can be used to approximate device
transient thermal resistance on the basis of a simplified one-dimensional
(1D) thermal equivalent circuit model.4 To precisely determine the thermal time constant, the probe optical
pulse width is reduced from 100 μs to 50 ns and the VDS pulse width is reduced to 1 μs. The
first 1 μs heat up phase corresponds to the state when VDS pulse is on, and the rest 1 μs cool
down phase represents the state when VDS pulse is set to be 0 V. Because the thermal time constants are independent
of the amplitude of heating, VDS was chosen
to produce similar transient heating amplitude for the GOOI FETs on
the two different substrates to avoid different temperature-induced
variations. Figure 4a,b describes the three-dimensional (3D) plot ΔT of the GOOI FETs on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates during
the heating and cooling dynamics. Figure 4c is the heating and cooling phase comparison
between two substrates. It takes GOOI FETs τH of
350 and 350 ns to reach the steady state during the heat up phase
and τC of 250 and 300 ns to cool down on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates. The cooling phase is of particular
importance to investigate the heat dissipation through the substrate.
Here, we take GOOI FET on the sapphire substrate as an example. The
time constant of heat dissipation or cooling phase τC through a material is t2/(κ/ρCV)4, where t is
the heat dissipation depth, ρ is the mass density, and CV is the specific heat. Those parameters are
listed in Supporting Information. For sapphire
substrate, the t is calculated to be 2.03 μm
at τC = 300 ns, which yields an overall transient RT of 5.0 × 10–2 mm2·K/W by RT = t/κ.25 The extracted RT from transient is in good agreement with the steady
state RT of 4.62 × 10–2 mm2·K/W. As for the SiO2/Si substrate,
this simplification overestimates transient RT because part of the heat can diffuse up to the gate metal
and then get dissipated through lateral diffusion due to the extremely
low κ of SiO2.

two devices. GOOI FET on sapphire has a cooling phase τC of 300 ns, yielding an overall transient RT of 5.0 × 10–2 mm2·K/W,
which is in good agreement with steady state TR measurement.

Simulation Verification
To rationalize our experimental
results and evaluate the improvement in the thermal management of
GOOI FETs using the sapphire substrate to replace the SiO2/Si substrate, we have also carried out the modeling work to investigate
the SHE on the devices with the finite-element method (FEM). In the
model, we have defined the heat source as the 80/100 nm thick β-Ga2O3 nanomembranes. The substrate thickness is set
to be 10 μm, and the bottom of the substrate is set to be T = 300 K. The thermal boundary resistance (RTB) for β-Ga2O3 systems is
not well known; consequently, we use RTB as a fitting parameter in our model. For an initial value of RTB, we use GaN RTB of 1.67 × 10–2 mm2·K/W between
β-Ga2O3 and two substrates. The choice
of GaN RTB for the initial value is arbitrary,
on the basis of only the prevalence of GaN in power electronics applications.26Figure 5a shows the simulated T distribution of GOOI
FET on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates at P of 717 and 917 W/mm2, corresponding to the respective
power applied for the experimental TR images. For GOOI FET on the
SiO2/Si substrate, β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane
has ΔT = 106 K at the gate region, in great
contrast to the ΔT of 41 K on the sapphire
substrate, showing the significantly reduced device temperature after
implementing a higher κ substrate. Figure 5b shows the transient TR measured ΔT distribution and corresponding FEM simulation of the temperature
distribution along the gate width across the channel direction on
the sapphire substrate. At all time regimes, both the simulated and
measured temperature profiles coincide very well and indicate that
the peak temperature is located at the center of the gate region with
β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane underneath. This
profile possesses a sharp decrease of the temperature at the front
and back edges of the β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane,
which is normalized to the current conduction direction. This in return
verifies our 1D approximation is reasonable in that most of the heat
is directly dissipated through the substrate rather than being laterally
dissipated through the gate metal. On the contrary, for the GOOI FET
on the SiO2/Si substrate, there is a significant amount
of heat diffused to gate metal and then laterally dissipated through
the gate metal region without the nanomembrane underneath, as indicated
in Figure 5a. Therefore,
the 1D simplified model has its limitation for application on the
SiO2/Si substrate or other low κ substrates. Finally,
good agreements are achieved both on the steady state and transient
heating and cooling phases, validating our experiments and the TR
characterization technique and further confirming the reduced SHE
using sapphire as a substrate.

GOOI FETs and experimental
design verification. (a) Simulated temperature distribution of GOOI
FETs on SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates with device power
density of 717 and 917 W/mm2, respectively. GOOI FET on

on the SiO2/Si substrate. (b) Simulated and measured temperature
distribution along the gate width cutline direction on the sapphire
substrate at various heat up and cool down phases. Good agreements
are achieved both at steady state and transient time domain between
measured and simulated data, verifying our experiment design and characterization.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated that the sapphire substrate can
provide much better thermal dissipation and less SHE than the SiO2/Si substrate for high-power device GOOI FETs. Both the simulation
and TR imaging reveal that the GOOI FET on the sapphire substrate
has twice lower ΔT compared to that on the
SiO2/Si substrate for identical device power density. The RT is extracted and calculated to be 4.6 ×
10–2 and 1.47 × 10–1 mm2·K/W for sapphire and SiO2/Si substrates,
respectively. Benefiting from the enhanced heat dissipation, better
electronic device performance of GOOI FET on the sapphire substrate
is achieved.

Experimental Methods
Device Fabrication
The Sn-doped (2̅01) β-Ga2O3 bulk
substrate was purchased from Tamura Corporation,
which has a carrier concentration of 2.8 × 1018 cm–3 determined by capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement. The nanomembranes
were mechanically exfoliated from the bulk substrate’s edge
cleavage through the scotch tape method. The exfoliation process was
repeated to get thin nanomembranes. After the exfoliation, nanomembranes
were transferred to the SiO2/Si and sapphire substrates,
the same method to get other 2D flakes. Prior to the transfer, the
SiO2/p++ Si and sapphire substrates were cleaned
in acetone for 24 h and the β-Ga2O3 nanomembrane
transfer time was within 1 min. ZEP 520A was used as the electron-beam
lithography (EBL) resist in our experiment. Source and drain regions
were defined by the VB6 EBL system followed by resist development,
Ti/Al/Au metallization and lift-off processes. Thirty seconds of Ar
plasma bombardment with radio frequency power of 100 W was adopted
to the source and drain regions before metallization to improve the
contact formation. The device without Ar bombardment shows more severe
Schottky-like behaviors and larger contact resistance. Fifteen nanometers
of Al2O3 was then deposited by an ASM F-120
atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) system at 250 °C with trimethyl-aluminum
and H2O as precursors. Finally, Ni/Au were deposited as
the gate electrode, followed by a lift-off process.

Device Characterization
The thickness and surface roughness
of the (100) β-Ga2O3 channel was measured
by a Veeco Dimension 3100 AFM system. The C–V measurement was done with an Agilent E4980A LCR meter.
The device electric characterizations were carried out by a Keithley
4200 Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer. A Microsanj TR system with
high-speed pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) (λ = 530 nm) probe
illumination and a synchronized CCD camera were used for the TR measurement
equipment.
