This
study reports two synthetic approaches leading to 2-aminobenzoxazoles
and their N-substituted analogues. Our first synthetic
strategy involves a reaction between various o-aminophenols
and N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-toluenesulfonamide as a nonhazardous electrophilic cyanating agent
in the presence of Lewis acid. The second synthetic approach uses
the Smiles rearrangement upon activation of benzoxazole-2-thiol with
chloroacetyl chloride. Both developed synthetic protocols are widely
applicable, afford the desired aminobenzoxazoles in good to excellent
yields, and use nontoxic and inexpensive starting material.

Introduction
2-Aminobenzoxazoles
and their N-substituted analogues
play an important role in medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.2−8 They are described as potential therapeutic agents including various
enzyme inhibitors (proteases, chymase, butyrylcholinesterase, topoisomerase
II inhibitors, etc.).5,8,9 They
also have applications in materials chemistry.10 In addition, aminobenzoxazoles serve as positron emission
tomography probes.3 Therefore, the development
of effective methods leading to 2-aminobenzoxazoles and their analogues
has attracted great attention.

Several methods for synthesis
of 2-aminobenzoxazoles have been
reported (Scheme 1).9,11−21 However, most of these methods suffer from specific drawbacks. The
most published protocol comprises the cyclization of 2-aminophenols
using BrCN as a cyanating agent,9,15−19,22 but this BrCN reagent is highly
toxic. The next reported approach is the direct 2-C amination of benzoxazoles,23−25 but its drawbacks include the use of transition metal catalysts,
high temperatures, nitrogen atmosphere, or co-oxidants. In recent
years, many efficient methods have been developed for the synthesis
of N-substituted aminobenzoxazoles.26−33 Most of these methods suffer from low yields and use toxic precursors
or expensive reagents. N-substituted aminobenzoxazoles
can be prepared from corresponding hydroxyl/thiol scaffolds through
the aryl halides (Scheme 1).31 Unfortunately, this method
requires toxic and acidic halogenating agents. Amination using Rose
Bengal as a photocatalyst has been recently reported.29 Despite being efficient and the low cost of Rose Bengal
catalyst, this protocol needs a strong organic base (DBU) and has
long reaction time that downgrade its advantages. Microwave-enhanced
on-water amination of 2-mercaptobenzoxazoles has also been recently
introduced.30 However, its drawbacks include
an inert atmosphere or co-oxidants. In addition, transition metal
catalysts used in this method may be expensive and higher temperatures
are sometimes inevitable.

Scheme 1 Aminobenzoxazole Synthesis
Given the shortcomings of the abovementioned methods,
we attempted
to develop a new, nontoxic, and efficient protocol relying on an inexpensive
starting material. Thus, accordingly, we designed two independent
protocols leading to 2-aminobenzoxazoles (Scheme 1, path a) and their N-mono
or disubstituted analogues (Scheme 1, path b). The first protocol is based on the use of N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-toluenesulfonamide
(NCTS) as a nonhazardous electrophilic cyanating agent. It combines
operational simplicity, a nontoxic reagent, and wide substrate scope.
The second approach is based on the Smiles rearrangement that enables
the functionalization of heteroaromatic rings under economic conditions.
Both the developed protocols are widely applicable and afford the
desired compounds in good yields, thus indicating their efficacy.

Results
and Discussion
In 2015, Kasthuri et al. reported the synthesis
of 2-aminobenzoxazoles
using an efficient, air-stable, and nonhazardous electrophilic cyanating
agent, i.e., NCTS.14 NCTS can be easily
synthesized from inexpensive and commercially available phenyl urea
by dehydrative tosylation in pyridine in high yields.34 The synthetic protocol described by Kasthuri et al.14 required 1 equiv of LiHMDS to accomplish the
reaction. Unfortunately, despite our efforts to acquire additional
optimization, we found the reaction to be irreproducible in our hands
as it yielded only up to 11% of the desired product 2a (Table 1, entry 6).35 Compound 3 was always detected
as the major product according to liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) traces.

Following these results, we changed the reaction conditions keeping
NCTS as a cyanating agent. Initial investigations were aimed at the
direct use of NCTS without any activation. Unfortunately, NCTS was
found to be ineffective in this case. Thus, we suggested that the
use of a strong Lewis acid as BF3·Et2O
in combination with NCTS could successfully activate the CN group
toward a nucleophilic attack34 and afford
the desired product 2a. Indeed, our expectations met
with successful results, and after some optimization (Table 2), the desired product 2a was obtained in good yield. Using these optimal conditions,
the reaction can proceed even at a 5 mmol scale. This result suggested
that the process might be scaled up with only a slightly lower yield.

With optimum reaction conditions, the substrate scope was explored
(Table 3). We found
out that the substitution pattern does not affect the reaction yields.
Both EWG and EDG substituents yielded the desired products in moderate
to good yields (45–60%). Considering the satisfactory LC–MS
conversions, we estimated that the multistep isolation and purification
procedure resulted in lowered isolated yields. Hence, different solvents
were tried to improve the workup and isolated yield (Supporting Information, Table S1). Unfortunately, none of the used solvents
led to a higher yield.

h.

Based on the observations
and prevalent literature,36 the reaction
mechanism was proposed (Scheme 2). The reaction is
initiated through the Lewis acidic activation of NCTS via the coordination
of its cyano group to BF3·Et2O. The activation
facilitates the subsequent nucleophilic attack of the amino group
and the elimination of the sulfonamide residue. The hydroxy group
then attacks the electron-deficient carbon. Finally, the desired product 2 is formed during the workup. We confirmed the eliminated
sulfonamide by mass m/z = 246 [M
– H], providing the next experimental support for our mechanistic
proposal.

Scheme 2 Proposed Reaction Pathway
We were also interested in the catalyst-free synthesis of N-substituted benzoxazole analogues. Recently, the Smiles
rearrangement, an intramolecular SNAr reaction, has received
renewed attention.37 It enables the functionalization
of heteroaromatic rings via breaking a C–X single bond and
forming a new C–X or C–C bond under economic conditions.
In 2017, Wang et al. published an interesting synthesis of N-aryl-2-aminobenzoxazoles from substituted benzoxazole-2-thiol
and 2-chloro-N-arylacetamides in a KOH–dimethylformamide
(DMF) system.38 However, this method is
described only for aromatic substrates. By taking inspiration from
the capabilities of the Smiles rearrangement and commercially available
heterocyclic thiols, we suggested a synthetic approach to N-substituted aminobenzoxazoles.

First, we focused
on the reaction of benzoxazole-2-thiol with various
aliphatic bromoamines and expected the Smiles rearrangement to result
in the desired thiol (Scheme 3). Interestingly, some of the investigated substrates reacted
giving the mixture of thiol and disulfide or other unexpected products.

Scheme 3 Reaction of Benzoxazole-2-thiol with Various Aliphatic Bromoamines
The reaction of benzoxazole-2-thiol 4 with 3-bromopropylamine
HBr 5 according to the conditions listed by Abdelazeem
et al.4 gave a mixture of benzoxazole 6 and disulfide analogue 7 (Scheme 3). The reaction conditions
were further optimized concerning the amine and base equivalents (Supporting
Information, Table S2). If an excess of
the base was used, disulfide was obtained as the main product of the
reaction. However, 2 equiv of the amine together with 2 equiv of the
base provided compound 6 selectively. Moreover, radical
scavenger Et3N strongly suppressed disulfide 7 formation. Therefore, disulfide 7 might be probably
formed by a radical mechanism. On the other hand, there was no effect
of oxidation (Supporting Information, Table S2, entry 8).

Subsequently, we explored the reaction of benzoxazole-2-thiol
with
2-bromoethylamine HBr (Scheme 3). Surprisingly, we observed a different reactivity compared
to bromopropylamine (Supporting Information, Table S3). The reaction of benzoxazole-2-thiol started with 4 equiv
of the amine and 3 equiv of K2CO3, giving a
mixture of products 9 and 10. Disulfide 10 was formed selectively using just 2 equiv of the amine.
The temperature was found to play a key role in the reaction. Heating
at 70 °C resulted in a mixture of both compounds, and an increased
temperature of 120 °C afforded disulfide 10 selectively.
Changing the amount of K2CO3 did not provide
the desired selectivity. Consequently, we tried Et3N instead
and realized that 2 equiv of the amine and 1 equiv of Et3N are the most convenient conditions for the synthesis of compound 9.

We also studied the reactivity of benzoxazole-2-thiol
with 4-bromobutylamine
HBr 11 (Scheme 3, Supporting Information, Table S4). The bromoamine 11 was synthesized from commercially
available aminoalcohol according to the previously described procedure
followed by ionex workup.39 Surprisingly,
the rapid 5-membered ring closure provided pyrrolidine 14 as the main product regardless of the reaction conditions. This
ring-closing reaction is speeded up by negligible ring strain and
insignificant entropy change. Lower temperature only slowed all of
the conversion down. Finally, 2 equiv of the amine and 2 equiv of
Et3N in refluxing toluene provided compound 14 within 4 h.

The reactivity of 5-bromopentylamine HBr 15 was also
explored (Scheme 3,
Supporting Information, Table S5). Bromoamine 15 was synthesized from 5-aminopentan-1-ol according to the
previously described procedure followed by ionex workup.39 The substitution leading to product 16 proceeded smoothly after the careful optimizations using 2 equiv
of Et3N in refluxing toluene. Harsher reaction conditions
were tried to obtain the rearranged compound 17, but
we observed the formylation in DMF instead. As a result, compound 18 was isolated after the microwave irradiation.

We
next investigated the behavior of chloroacetamide as well as
aromatic substrates in the Smiles reaction (Scheme 4). For this, we studied the reactivity of
aromatic 4-bromobenzylamine 19 (Scheme 4, Supporting Information, Table S6). Lower susceptibility to nucleophilic attack usually
makes aromatic halides rather unreactive. However, the unexpected
reaction occurred on using 2 equiv of Et3N in refluxing
toluene. Under these conditions, the amino group was found to be sufficiently
nucleophilic to substitute the thiol, providing benzoxazolamine 22.

Scheme 4 Reaction of Benzoxazole-2-thiol with 4-Bromobenzylamine/2-Chloroacetamide/3-(Bromomethyl)aniline
The investigation of more challenging substrates
such as amides
and benzylic bromides gave only the expected substitution products.
Their rearrangement was probably prevented by sterically and energetically
demanding transition states. First, we examined the reactivity of
2-chloroacetamide 23 (Scheme 4, Supporting Information, Table S7). All of the optimizations gave mostly compound 25 probably due to lower acidic nitrogen nucleophilicity as
well as an unfavorable transition state. Moreover, microwave irradiation
afforded a mixture of 25 and 2-aminobenzoxazole 2. We also explored the reactivity of 3-(bromomethyl)aniline
(Scheme 4, Supporting
Information, Table S8). There was no rearrangement
regardless of the reaction conditions. We always obtained only the
substitution product 27. Finally, reactions with various
aromatic bromoanilines were attempted, but no reaction occurred as
expected.

Since we aimed at a wide substrate scope, a universal
method was
needed. Thus, a more challenging intramolecular variant of the Smiles
rearrangement using chloroacetyl chloride was explored (Table 4). First, reaction conditions
described by Tian et al.40 applied on cyclohexylamine
as a model substrate were attempted (Table 4, entry 1). This one-pot reaction was performed
under microwave irradiation as well as under conventional heating
in an oil bath at 160 °C. The second reaction provided a slightly
better result. Excess chloride or Cs2CO3, as
well as changing the solvent, prolonged the reaction time, or the
higher temperature gave worse conversion. On the other hand, no rearrangement
occurred using different bases. Since bromoacetyl bromide showed better
activating properties, milder reaction conditions were considered
for aniline (Supporting Information, Table S9). The reaction proceeded even at 85 °C without compromising
the isolated yield. Different bases provided only the substitution
product 31c. Unfortunately, these milder conditions failed
with other amines giving the substitution product 31 only.

b Conversion
estimated from LC–MS
traces at 210–500 nm.

With the optimized reaction conditions, we studied the scope of
the rearrangement (Table 5). Various types of amines, including aromatic, aliphatic,
alicyclic (both primary and secondary), and bisnucleophilic ethanolamine,
were tested. Regardless of the electron effects and substitution patterns,
the aromatic and primary amines reacted smoothly, giving the desired
products 30a–h in good yields (58–83%).
On the other hand, a steric hindrance on the amine lowered the yield
significantly. The reaction resulted in a moderate isolated yield
of benzoxazole 30l (32%), while the reaction with morpholine
gave low yield of 30j (25%). The rearrangement of diethylamine
completely failed. Finally, we upscaled the reaction of benzoxazole-2-thiol 4 with aniline to 3.5 mmol of 4, which required
a slightly prolonged reaction time (8 h), giving 30c in
a 71% isolated yield. This result suggested that the process also
can be upscaled with only a slightly lower yield.

Table 5 Substrate Scope of the Rearrangement
Based on the above observations and the existing literature,
the
reaction mechanism set out in Scheme 5 was suggested. First, S-alkylated
thiol undergoes the Smiles rearrangement by the nucleophilic attack
of the nitrogen at the benzoxazole ring carbon, forming a new C–N
bond to give the spiro intermediate. Second, rearomatization and alkaline
hydrolysis in the presence of Cs2CO3 afford
the N-substituted benzoxazole 30.

Scheme 5 Proposed Reaction Pathway
Conclusions
In conclusion, synthetic strategies affording various 2-aminobenzoxazoles
and their N-substituted analogues from readily available
starting materials have been developed. Our first approach to substituted
2-aminobenzoxazoles is based on the nonhazardous cyanating agent NCTS,
activated with BF3·Et2O. This newly developed
synthetic protocol combines operational simplicity, a nontoxic and
readily available reagent, and wide substrate scope. Moreover, an
efficient one-pot amination of benzoxazole-2-thiol by various amines
mediated with chloroacetyl chloride via the intramolecular Smiles
rearrangement was developed. Our methodology stands out because of
the wide amine scope, short reaction time, and a metal-free approach.
The obtained results also indicated that the reactions can be scaled
up, providing an alternative process for the chemical industry. Finally,
we believe that our methodologies represent a straightforward way
to various aminobenzoxazoles and their analogues as important building
blocks in organic and medicinal chemistry.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Solvents and chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (www.sigmaaldrich.com) and Fluorochem (www.fluorochem.co.uk). All reactions were carried out at ambient temperature (21 °C)
unless stated otherwise. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
was performed using aluminum plates precoated with silica gel (silica
gel 60 F254).

The LC–MS analyses were carried out on
an UHPLC–MS system consisting of UHPLC chromatograph Accela
with a photodiode array detector and triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
TSQ Quantum Access (Thermo Scientific, CA), using a Nucleodur Gravity
C18 column (dimensions 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm2 at
30 °C and a flow rate of 800 μL/min (Macherey-Nagel, Germany)).
The mobile phase was (A) 0.1% ammonium acetate in water and (B) 0.1%
ammonium acetate in acetonitrile, linearly programmed from 10 to 80%
B over 2.5 min, kept for 1.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated with
10% of solution B for 1 min. The APCI source operated at a discharge
current of 5 μA, vaporizer temperature of 400 °C, and a
capillary temperature of 200 °C.

NMR 1H/13C spectra were
recorded on a JEOL ECX-500SS (500 MHz)
or JEOL ECA400II (400 MHz) spectrometer at magnetic field strengths
of 11.75 T (with operating frequencies 500.16 MHz for 1H and 125.77
MHz for 13C) and 9.39 T (with operating frequencies 399.78 MHz for
1H and 100.53 MHz for 13C) at ambient temperature (∼21 °C).
Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm),
and coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz
(Hz). NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature (21 °C)
in DMSO-d6 and referenced to the resonance
signal of the solvent.

HRMS analysis was performed with LC–MS
and an Orbitrap high-resolution
mass spectrometer (Dionex, Ultimate 3000, Thermo Exactive plus, MA)
operating in positive full scan mode in the range of 80–1200 m/z. The settings for electrospray ionization
were as follows: 150 °C oven temperature and 3.6 kV source voltage.
The acquired data were internally calibrated with phthalate as a contaminant
in methanol (m/z 297.15909). Samples
were diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in a solution of
water and acetonitrile (50:50, v/v). The samples were injected into
the mass spectrometer following HPLC separation on a Kinetex C18 column
(2.6 μm, 100 A, 50 × 3.0 mm2) using an isocratic
mobile phase of 0.01 M MeCN/ammonium acetate (80/20) at a flow rate
of 0.3 mL/min.

All reactions carried out under microwave irradiation
were performed
with the CEM Discover SP microwave synthesizer, using the dynamic
mode in the following settings: maximum amount of microwave power
(150 W), premixing time (1 min), and stirring speed (high). A simultaneous
cooling of the reaction vessel provided by compressed air (24 psi)
was applied during the entire experiment (PowerMax option “ON”).
All 0.5 mmol scale reactions were performed in a 10 mL borosilicate
glass reaction vessel closed with a disposable silicon cap and equipped
with a Teflon-coated egg-shaped magnetic stir bar. The temperature
was monitored by an external infrared sensor.

O-aminophenol 1 (0.9
mmol; 1 equiv) and NCTS (1.35 mmol;
1.5 equiv) were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (4 mL). BF3·Et2O (1.8 mmol; 2 equiv) was added dropwise. The mixture was
refluxed overnight (monitored by TLC, 24–30 h). After that,
the cooled (rt) mixture was quenched with sat. NaHCO3 (pH

Substitution with Cyclohexylamine
To a stirred solution
of amine 29 (0.48 mmol, 1 equiv) and DBU (1.54 mmol,
3.2 equiv) in MeCN (3 mL) cooled to −5 °C were added chloroacetyl
chloride (0.58 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and benzoxazole-2-thiol 4 (0.48 mmol, 1 equiv). The reaction mixture was refluxed (monitored
by TLC, 3 h). After that, the cooled (rt) mixture was diluted by H2O (20 mL), extracted with CH2Cl2 (3
× 30 mL), and washed with brine (50 mL). Combined organic layers
were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo.
The residue was purified by column chromatography using Hex/EtOAc.
