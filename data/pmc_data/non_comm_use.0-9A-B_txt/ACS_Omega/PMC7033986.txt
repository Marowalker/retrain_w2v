A series
of novel amphiphilic functionalized fibers with polarity
tunable surface microenvironment were constructed by introducing hydrophilic
polyamines and hydrophobic linear alkyl chain groups, aiming to selectively
remove parabens from water. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
etc. were employed to determine the successful preparation of amphiphilic
functionalized fibers. The adsorption experimental data indicated
that the amphiphilic fibers showed excellent selectivity for parabens.
In the amphiphilic fibers, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction
existing in one molecular unit can effectively act together to enhance
the interaction between substrate and fibers. Kinetic studies illustrated
that the adsorption process was a physical adsorption with chemical
characteristics. The overall initial adsorption rate together with
the stepwise adsorption rate was quantified, and it is inferred that
the hydrophobic interaction plays a leading role in the first step
of the adsorption process. Moreover, the Freundlich model well described
the sorption process with a maximum adsorption of 138.4 mg/g. What’s
more, the fiber still keeps excellent adsorption capacity (>90%)
even
after 10 adsorption/desorption cycles, which certifies it is an excellent
adsorbent and can be utilized to remove paraben in practice.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Parabens
are esters derived from p-hydroxybenzoic
acid, containing methyparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben
(PrP), butylparaben (BuP), and octylparaben (OcP); they are quite
stable in acidic solutions, and their hydrolysis rate in alkaline
solutions decreases with the increase of alkyl chain length.1 Parabens as preservatives have been widely applied
in food, medicine, cosmetics, and other fields.2,3 Relevant
reports show that these substances have estrogen activity and are
detected in human breast tumor tissues, which may be the cause of
male infertility and breast cancer.4−6 Nowadays, parabens are
considered as endocrine-disrupting compounds and are acknowledged
as environmental pollutants.7 Around the
world, many countries have introduced legislations to regulate the
use and release of parabens into the environment. Regarding this,
the maximum allowable concentration of individual parabens in cosmetics
is set at 0.4% in China and 1.0% in Japan.8 In recent years, these substance has been detected in sludge,9 soil, environmental water,10 and even humans,11,12 which is attributed
to the excessive use of paraben compounds. Therefore, it is necessary
and meaningful to remove parabens from aqueous solution.

Currently,
among all of the parabens treatment methods, such as
heterogeneous photocatalysis, advance oxidation, and photo-Fenton,13−16 adsorption has attracted much attention. In this method, pollutants
in waste water can be efficiently captured through a variety of forces,
such as electrostatic interactions,17,18 complexation,19 π–π interactions,20 and other interaction forces.21−24 However, some adsorbent carriers
have complex surface properties,25 which
makes the interaction mechanism with pollutants relatively ambiguous.
In addition, since the forces rarely act alone, this greatly interferes
with the study of the mechanical interactions of certain forces.26 Hence, it is also a great challenge to systematically
explore the interaction mechanism of specific forces between adsorbents
and pollutants.

In recent years, organic textile fibers, such
as polypropylene
fiber (PPF), polyacrylonitrile fiber (PANF), etc., have proved to
be good carrier materials due to their stable nature and environmentally
friendly properties.27−34 The support material with simple and clear surface can be applied
to control the number of interaction mechanisms to simplify the adsorption
process. Polypropylene fiber (PPF) provides a way for this challenge
with low cost, simple surface chemical structure, and simple production
technology. These attractive advantages make PPF an excellent carrier
for adsorbent. Furthermore, the surface of polypropylene fiber can
be modified through different chemical methods to construct active
sites. For example, in our previous works, ionic liquid-functionalized
polypropylene fibers were prepared and used for the first time to
catalyze some organic reactions.27 Parabens
are amphiphilic organic substances with hydrophilic hydroxyl group
and hydrophobic alkyl group coexisting in their molecules. This will
encourage us to construct a specific surface on the fiber according
to the structure of target pollutants.

In this work, the amphiphilic
structure functionalized fibers (PPA-PF-Cn) with adjustable
surface microenvironment were constructed through a three-step reaction
originated from polypropylene fiber (PPF) (Scheme 2) and used to selectively remove parabens
from water. In the amphiphilic fibers, the type of adsorption driving
force is limited, so it is convenient to study the adsorption mechanism
of different interactions. The effect of the degree of hydrophobicity
of the amphiphilic structural fibers on the adsorption process was
also discussed. Thereafter, the adsorption behaviors of functionalized
fibers for parabens were studied in detail and the overall initial
adsorption rate was calculated. In addition, cycle performance was
also explored to further verify the superiority and application potential
of amphiphilic functionalized fibers.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Functionalized
Fibers
The degree of modification and the water uptake of
functionalized fibers are presented in Table 1. Considering the grafting amount and mechanical
strength of the fiber, PPAF and PPA-PF with weight gains of 88.0 and 32.5%, respectively, were selected
for the next grafting reaction (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). Different amphiphilic structure
fibers (PPA-PF-Cn, n = 4, 8, and 12) were constructed and their functional
degree was kept at about 0.90 mmol/g so that the measurement standard
was the same in subsequent experiments (Table 1, entries 4–6).

Table 1 Weight Gain of Functionalized Fibers
and Their Functional Degree and Water Uptake
entry	fiber	weight gain (%)	functional degree (mmol/g)	water uptake

5	PPA-PF-C8	11.2	0.90a	35.8	
6	PPA-PF-C12	17.4	0.89a	30.6	
a The functional degree is obtained
by fiber weight gain.

b The
functional degree of PPA-PF is obtained by acid–base
titration.

The water uptake
content is one of the key factors in determining
the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of the fibers.35 In this work, amino and alkyl groups are used to tune the
hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface microenvironment of the fiber
adsorbents and the water uptake of different fibers was measured to
reveal the hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of the fibers and the
result is listed in Table 1. The original polypropylene fiber shows a very low water
uptake of 0.6% because of its strong hydrophobic surface (Table 1, entry 1), and amino
groups exhibit strong hydrophilicity; hence, after free radical polymerization
and the immobilization of HPEI, the water uptake rate of the modified
fibers was remarkly enhanced up to 82.6 and 95.2%, respectively, indicating
the successful construction of hydrophilic structures on fiber surface
(Table 1, entries 2
and 3). As expected, the water uptake rate of all amphiphilic fibers
(Table 1, entries 4–6)
obviously decreased with the introduction of hydrophobic alkyl chain
and the fiber PPA-PF-C12 with the longest
carbon chain shows the lowest water uptake (Table 1, entry 6). The experiment results illustrate
that the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces were successfully constructed
on the amphiphilic structure fiber.

The Fourier-transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of PPF, PPAF, PPA-PF,
PPA-PF-C4, PPA-PF-C8, and PPA-PF-C12 are shown in Figure 1. Compared with the
original PPF (Figure 1a), the PPAF (Figure 1b) shows two broad
peaks at 3100–3500 cm–1, corresponding to
the stretching vibration peaks of N–H bond in primary amine
and the two peaks at 1660 and 1609 cm–1 are ascribed
to the stretching vibrations of C=O, -NH, and -C-N-.36,37 These absorption peaks prove the successful introduction of amide
group onto the fiber. After amination modification (Figure 1c), the appearance of a peak
at 1570 cm–1 is attributed to the asymmetric bending
vibration of the primary amine;38 the N-H
deformation vibration and C-N stretching vibration were observed at
810 and 1255 cm–1, respectively, which indicates
that HPEI was successfully grafted onto the fibers.39−41 It observed
that the IR spectra of the amphiphilic fibers (Figure 1d–f) are similar to that of parent
PPA-PF probably due to the lack of apparent characteristic
absorption of alkyl chain moiety.

The elemental analysis
was used to demonstrate the successful preparation
of PPA-PF-C12 and stability during the
application process. As listed in Table 2, compared with PPF, the nitrogen content
of PPAF obviously increased to 8.12% (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). This confirms
the successful grafting of acrylamide. After HPEI modification, the
carbon and hydrogen contents of PPA-PF (Table 2, entry 3) decreased,
while the nitrogen content increased due to the high nitrogen content
in HPEI. In addition, the carbon and hydrogen contents of PPA-PF-C12 significantly increased (Table 2, entry 4), due to the carbon (85.12%) and
hydrogen (14.88%) contents of dodecyl being higher than that of PPA-PF. It is worth mentioning that PPA-PF-C12-1 (the fiber recovered after the first adsorption
and desorption cycle) and PPA-PF-C12-10
(the fiber recovered after the tenth adsorption and desorption cycle)
possess similar elemental contents compared with fresh PPA-PF-C12, which confirms the excellent recycling performance
of PPA-PF-C12.

To further prove the successful construction of the amphiphilic
structure into fiber, XPS was applied to analyze the chemical composition
of PPF and the functional fibers. As shown in Figure 2a, the XPS full-scan spectra of PPA-PF and PPA-PF-C12 exhibit three peaks
at 284.00, 398.60, and 530.61 eV, corresponding to C 1s, N 1s, and
O 1s, respectively. The C 1s core spectrum of PPF (Figure 2b) is only curve-fitted into
a peak component and the BE is about 283.8 eV, belonging to C-C/C-H
species. After modification, the N 1s core spectrum of PPA-PF (Figure 2c) can
be deconvoluted into three peak components with BEs of about 398.51,
399.25, and 400.25 eV, which can be assigned to the -NH-, -NH2, and -NR2 species, respectively.42 This result suggests the successful grafting of HPEI. Furthermore,
the C 1s core spectrum of PPA-PF-C12 (Figure 2d) could be deconvoluted
into three peaks at 283.8, 285.3, and 286.0 eV, corresponding to C-C/C-H,
C-N, and C-O species, respectively.43

PPA-PF-C12, (b) C 1s XPS spectrum of
PPF, (c) N 1s XPS spectrum of PPA-PF, and (d) C
1s XPS spectra of PPA-PF-C12.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectrum of PPF (Figure S1a) shows four diffraction peaks at 14.1,
17.0, 18.5, and 21.6°, corresponding to (110), (040), (130),
and (111) crystallographic planes of the α crystal phase of
PPF, respectively.44,45 After the modification by polyethyleneimine
(Figure S1b), the diffraction peaks of
PPA-PF-C12 are broadened, which suggests
that part of the crystalline phase has slightly changed. Moreover,
after being used to absorb parabens once and ten times (Figure S1c,d), the spectra of recovered fibers
are nearly the same as fresh PPA-PF-C12, which shows that the amphiphilic fiber can be recycled at least
10 times without obvious change.

The surface morphological structure
of fibers was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images of PPF, PPA-PF-C12, PPA-PF-C12-1, and PPA-PF-C12-10 at different
magnifications are presented in Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3a, the surface of PPF is smooth. After modification
and one-time application, the fiber surfaces become a little bit rougher
than that of the original PPF (Figure 3b,c). This result suggests that the structure of the
fibers is well maintained and can be used in further study. After
being used ten times, the mechanical strength is damaged to a certain
extent and the fiber surfaces become coarser (Figure 3d). However, the overall integrity of the
fiber is not affected, which proves the excellent cycling capacity
of PPA-PF-C12.

2.2 Relationship
between Fiber Structure and Adsorption
Ability
The superiority of the amphiphilic fiber structure
was evaluated by comparing the adsorption properties of different
fibers to ethylparaben (EtP), butylparaben (BuP), and octylparaben
(OcP). As displayed in Figure 4a, the original PPF shows the weakest adsorption ability to
the three compounds due to lack of adsorption site on the fiber surface.
The adsorption amount of PPAF obviously increases owing
to the hydrogen bond interaction between fiber and parabens. After
the introduction of polyethyleneimine to PPAF, the adsorption
capacity of PPA-PF is slightly better than that
of parent PPAF. The result probably is due to the stronger
hydrogen bonding formed between -NH2 group and parabens.
After hydrophobic modification, the resulting amphiphilic fiber PPA-PF-Cn shows excellent
adsorption ability to parabens, as shown in Figure 4a. That may be because the objective compound
parabens have hydrophilic hydroxyl group and lipophilic alyl group
and therefore can be effectively adsorbed by these amiliphilic fibers
through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction.
In addition, the adsorption amount of fiber increases with different
degrees of hydrophobic modification. Especially, the PPA-PF-C12 with the strongest hydrophobility shows the most
powerful adsorption ability of 160 mg/g for OcP, indicating that the
hydrophobic interaction between the fibers and parabens plays the
main role in parabens removal. The adsorption properties of PPA-PF-C12 are compared with other types of
adsorbent, and the results are listed in Table S1. The adsorption capacity of PPA-PF-C12 is better than that of other adsorption material shown in Table S1.

of different adsorbents;
(b) The adsorption selectivity of PPA-PF-C12 for different contaminants; (c) FTIR spectra of BuP, PPA-PF-C12, and PPA-PF-C12 after
adsorption BuP; (d) the solid UV–vis spectra of PPA-PF-C12, BuP, and PPA-PF-C12-BuP.

The selectivity of the amphiphilic
fiber PPA-PF-C12 was tested using various
objective compounds, such
as phenol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), EtP, BuP,
and OcP. As shown in Figure 4b, obviously, PPA-PF-C12 has
almost no adsorption for phenol and it can adsorb PHBA in a small
adsorption amount with 17.3 mg/g because of the existence of -NH2 on fiber. However, PPA-PF-C12 shows excellent selectivity for paraben compounds and the selectivity
of amphiphilic fiber increases with the hydrophobility increase of
the paraben. BuP was selected as the model compound in a subsequent
research due to its medium carbon chain length. The competitive adsorption
experiments were performed by adsorbing a mixed solution of tetracycline
(TC) and butylparaben (BuP) at the same concentration. The results
are shown in Figure S2. As displayed in Figure S2, PPA-PF-C12 exhibits excellent selectivity, with 7 times the adsorption capacity
for BuP than TC, which further proves the outstanding selectivity
of PPA-PF-C12.

After adsorption
of BuP compounds, PPA-PF-C12-BuP was
characterized by FTIR and solid UV–vis spectra.
As presented in Figure 4c, PPA-PF-C12-BuP contains some characteristic
peaks of BuP after adsorption; for example, the peaks at 1283 and
1162 cm–1 belong to the stretching vibration of
C-O-C and the absorption peak at 1681 cm–1 is due
to stretching vibrations of C=O in BuP. In addition, the solid
UV–vis spectra of the fiber verify the successful adsorption
of BuP (Figure 4d).
After adsorption, PPA-PF-C12-BuP displays
a strong absorption band at 256 nm, which is fully consistent with
the maximum absorption wavelength of BuP measured by a UV–vis
spectrometer.

2.3 Synergistic Adsorption
Mechanism
A possible adsorption mechanism of amphiphilic
fiber for parabens
was proposed in Scheme 1 with BuP as the model compound. There are two kinds of interaction
force (hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding interaction) between
the amphiphilic fiber and parabens. The -NH2 group of polyamine
in the amphiphilic fibers is the main hydrogen bond absorption site,
which can form hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group in the BuP molecules
to remove BuP from waste water. At the same time, the amphiphilic
fibers can also utilize their hydrophobic carbon chain to enrich and
absorb BuP molecules that also have hydrophobic alkyl groups. In the amphiphilic fibers, two
kinds of functional groups are located in one molecular unit, so the
synergistic adsorption of the two interaction forces increases the
adsorption efficiency, and the hydrophobic interaction plays a major
role in the adsorption process (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Possible Adsorption Mechanism Diagram
2.4 Effect of Dodecyl Density
The different
functional degrees of PPA-PF-C12 were
investigated to explore the effect of dodecyl density on adsorption
capacity. As shown in Figure S3a, to some
extent, the adsorption capacity of PPA-PF-C12 for BuP enhances with the increase of the modified density
and the maximum can reach 98.3 mg/g (the functional degree is 0.89
mmol/g). After that, the adsorption of BuP becomes unfavorable due
to excessive hydrophobicity of the fiber.

2.5 Effect
of pH
The pH of solution is
critical for adsorption because it may affect the state of the adsorbent
and adsorbate.46 Therefore, the effect
of a series of different pH (3–10) on the adsorption capacity
of PPA-PF-C12 was investigated and the
results are shown in Figure S3b. At lower
pH values (3–5), the adsorption capacity enhances with the
increase of pH values. Under acidic condition, all interactions between
PPA-PF-C12 and BuP were reduced due to
hydrolyzation of BuP and protonation of PPA-PF-C12. In alkaline condition (pH = 8–10), the reduction
of hydrophobic interaction plays a major role so the adsorption capacity
decreased rapidly. In summary, the optimum pH range for the adsorption
of BuP is 5.0–8.0.

2.6 Adsorption Kinetics
The adsorption
kinetics of PPF, PPA-PF, and PPA-PF-C12 for BuP were investigated to reveal the adsorption
mechanism (Figure 5). It can be seen that PPA-PF-C12 displays
the best adsorption for BuP with the maximum adsorption amount of
98.5 mg/g, which is more than 4 times and 11 times that of PPA-PF (26.2 mg/g) and the original PPF (9.2 mg/g), respectively.
Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, the fiber PPA-PF-C12 can achieve
half-saturation adsorption within 5 min and reach adsorption equilibrium
at 120 min.

Figure 5 Adsorption kinetic curves of PPF, PPA-PF, and
PPA-PF-C12 for BuP.

To better understand the adsorption kinetic process, two kinetic
models, including pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order model,
were used to interpret the kinetic characteristics of BuP adsorption
process. The pseudo first-order eq 1 and pseudo second-order eq 2 can be given in the following form47,48 1   2  where Qt (mg/g)
is the amount of BuP adsorbed on the adsorbent at a given time t (min) and Qe (mg/g) is the
equilibrium adsorption of the adsorbent, while k1 (min–1) and k2 [g/(mg min)] are pseudo first-order and pseudo second-order rate
constants, respectively.

The kinetic experimental data were
fitted by the pseudo first-order eq 1 and pseudo second-order eq 2, and the fitting plots
are presented in Figure S4. The values
of k1, k2, Qe,exp (experimental value), Qe,cal (calculated value based on model), and the corresponding
correlation value (R2) are shown in Table 3. Compared with Qe,cal,1 values of pseudo first order, the Qe,exp values are closer to Qe,cal,2 values of pseudo second-order and the values of R2 for the pseudo second-order are greater than
the pseudo first-order model, which indicates that the pseudo second-order
model is more suitable for fitting experimental data.

Table 3 Kinetic Parameters
 	 	pseudo first-order model	pseudo second-order model	
adsorbents	Qe,exp (mg/g)	k1 (min–1)	Qe,cal,1 (mg/g)	R2	k2 [g/(mg min)]	Qe,cal,2 (mg/g)	R2	
PPA-PF-C12	98.5	0.0325	68.5	0.9671	2.0 × 10–3	99.1	0.9996	
PPA-PF	26.2	0.1280	10.8	0.9545	6.5 × 10–2	26.3	0.9999	
PP	9.5	0.1126	2.0	0.9932	1.8 × 10–1	9.5	0.9997	
Whether
the adsorption process is driven by hydrophobic interaction
or hydrogen bonding interaction, it belongs to physical interaction.
However, the kinetic data conforming to the second-order model means
that this adsorption process is chemisorption. Therefore, we define
the adsorption of the functionalized fibers for molecule BuP as physical
adsorption with chemical characteristics based on modification active
sites.

Moreover, the Weber–Morris intraparticle diffusion
model
was used to identify the limiting step in the adsorption process and
it can be described by the following formula49,50 3  where kint is
the interparticle diffusion rate constant [mg/(g min1/2)] and the intercept C is a constant relevant to
the thickness of the boundary layer.

The fitting plots are depicted
in Figure 6. The plot
exhibits three linear regions,
which means the intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate-limiting
step during the fiber adsorption process according to Mittal.51 The first stage is external mass transfer, including
the diffusion of the boundary layer of the solute molecules and the
diffusion of the solute molecules to the outer surface of the adsorbent.
The second stage is the diffusion in the fiber modified layer, which
is the rate-determining step. The intercept C increases
at this stage (C = 65.93, Table S2), indicating an increase in the thickness of the boundary
layer and the mass transfer resistance of the external liquid. Therefore,
the opportunity of external mass transfer is reduced and the possibility
of internal mass transfer is increased. The third stage is the adsorption
dynamic balance phase.

Figure 6 Intraparticle diffusion model plot.

The double-exponential model can be used to describe the diffusion-controlled
mechanism. And according to this model, the adsorption process is
divided into two steps. The first step involves external film diffusion
and internal diffusion; then, a slow step follows, which is controlled
by intraparticle diffusion.52−54 The formula is presented as53,55 4  The overall initial rate of different fibers
can be determined by the derivative eq 5(56) 5  For initial conditions 6  where D1 and D2 are sorption rate parameters
(mg/L) of the
rapid and the slow step, respectively, and KD1 and KD2 are diffusion parameters
(min–1).

Obviously, the adsorption amounts QDe,cal (calculated by the double-exponential
equation) as shown in Table 4 are quite close to
the experimental result Qe,exp, as shown
in Table 3. Therefore,
the model also responds well to this adsorption process, although
there are differences between polypropylene fibers and porous materials.

PPA-PF-C12	99.1	0.596	0.1386	3.304	1.475	0.0301	0.9861	1.776	5.080

PP	9.5	0.004	0.1680	0.029	0.018	0.0324	0.9792	0.023	0.052	
The overall initial adsorption rate v0 of the amphiphilic fiber PPA-PF-C12 is significantly higher than that of PPF and PPA-PF, which is consistent with its excellent adsorption
ability. The
overall initial rate can be further decomposed into v01 and v02 belonging to the
rapid and the slow step rates, respectively, as shown in Table 4. The PPF fiber displays
an extremely low order of magnitude of rate in both steps according
to its poor adsorption ability. The initial rates of the fiber PPA-PF-C12 and PPA-PF for
the slow step are comparable (1.776 and 1.310, respectively), while
the fiber PPA-PF-C12 exhibits quite higher
initial rates (3.304) in the rapid step. It’s stated that the
main differences between the two fibers exist in the rapid step. These
results demonstrate that in the rapid step, the fiber PPA-PF-C12 can enrich the organic molecule quickly taking advantage
of the hydrophobic interaction corresponding to its long carbon chain
structure and accelerate the adsorption process. It can be inferred
that the hydrophobic effect plays the most important role in the whole
adsorption process.

2.7 Adsorption Isotherm
The effect of
the initial concentration of BuP on adsorption by PPA-PF-C12 was examined. Two isotherm models containing the
Langmuir model and the Freundlich model were used to fit the experimental
data, and the fitting plots are presented in Figure S5. All of the equations are expressed as40,57−59 7   8  where n is the
heterogeneity
and KF and KL are the Freundlich adsorption constant (mg/g) and Langmuir adsorption
constant (L/mg), respectively. The isotherm parameters are displayed
in Table 5.

Table 5 Parameters for Freundlich and Langmuir
Models
Langmuir
isotherm model	Freundlich
isotherm model	
Qmax (mg/g)	KL (L/mg)	R2	KF (mg/g)	n	R2	
214.13	0.005486	0.9717	1.850	1.273	0.9934	
The Freundlich isotherm depicts nonideal adsorption,
which can
be used in the multilayer adsorption with diverse adsorption heat
and affinities on the heterogeneous surface. The Langmuir model assumes
ideal monolayer adsorption with identical adsorption energy. According
to the correlation coefficient (R2), the
experimental data are more consistent with the Freundlich isotherm
model (R2 = 0.9934, Table 5) than with the Langmuir isotherm model (R2 = 0.9717, Table 5), clarifying that the adsorption process
is multilayer heterogeneous adsorption. It is noted that the maximum
adsorption amount (Qmax) of PPA-PF-C12 for BuP at equilibrium concentrations from the adsorption
isotherm curve is 138.4 mg/g (Figure S6). So the amphiphilic structure adsorbent has a good advantage and
application prospect.

2.8 Adsorption Thermodynamics
The adsorption
thermodynamics of PPA-PF-C12 and PPA-PF for the model compound BuP were tested, and the
thermodynamics curve is presented in Figure 7. The results show that high temperature
promotes the adsorption of PPA-PF-C12 (Figure 7a) while
low temperature benefits the adsorption of PPA-PF (Figure 7b) because
only hydrogen bonding interaction exists in PPA-PF and the extent of hydrogen bonding decreases with an increase of

on the adsorption for BuP by (a) PPA-PF-C12 and (b) PPA-PF.

Reaction rate constants k at different temperatures
were acquired by pseudo second-order fitting of above data, and Table 6 displays all parameters.
The experimental results illustrate that the adsorption activation
energy (activation energy was calculated by the Arrhenius equation)
of the amphiphilic fiber is much smaller than that of the PPA-PF fiber.19 This is due to the synergistic
effect of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction existing in
the PPA-PF-C12 fiber, which can obviously
decrease the energy barrier.

Arrhenius equation

2.9 Desorption and Reusability
The recyclability
is an important indicator of the potential applicability of the fiber.
The desorption kinetics of the amphiphilic fiber PPA-PF-C12 was investigated using ethanol as eluent, as shown
in Figure 8a. As shown Figure 8a, BuP could be almost
completely desorbed from the fiber in 30 min. After 10 times of the
adsorption–desorption cycle (Figure 8b), the adsorption amount slightly decreased
and the removal efficiency still remained above 90%. Moreover, the
FTIR spectra (Figure S7) verify that the
fibers show no significant change after 10 times of the recycling
experiment. This means that the amphiphilic structured fiber has excellent
reusability and stability.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, a series of functionalized
polypropylene fibers
was prepared and applied to remove parabens from water. Among the
modified fibers, PPA-PF-C12 with amphiphilic
structure exhibited the most powerfully selective adsorption ability
for parabens due to the synergistic effect of hydrophobic interaction
and hydrogen bonding interaction and a possible adsorption mechanism
of amphiphilic fiber for parabens was proposed. In addition, it is
found that the adsorption of BuP by PPA-PF-C12 is multilayer heterogeneous physical adsorption with chemical
characteristics based on active sites and the adsorption process can
be described better by the pseudo second-order kinetic model. According
to the Weber–Morris intraparticle diffusion model, the intraparticle
diffusion is not the sole rate-limiting step during the fiber adsorption
process. The overall initial adsorption rate as well as the stepwise
adsorption rate calculated by the double-exponential model indicate
that the hydrophobic effect plays a leading role in the adsorption
system. Moreover, the Freundlich model well describes the sorption
process with a maximum adsorption of 138.4 mg/g. The activation energy
of PPA-PF-C12 (25.08 kJ/mol) is much
lower than that of PPA-PF (43.96 kJ/mol) due to
the constructed synergistic adsorption. Importantly, PPA-PF-C12 can be reused more than 10 times and the removal
rate is still above 90%, which means that the fiber has high stability
and superior reusability. Therefore, the amphiphilic structure PPA-PF-C12 fiber has great potential application
in water treatment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Commercially available
PPF with a length of 1.5 cm and diameter of 30 ± 0.5 μm
(purchased from the Sheyang Enyu Chemical Fiber Co. Ltd of China)
was used. Acrylamide, benzoyl peroxide (BPO), (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O,
hyperbranched polyethyleneimine (HPEI) ((Mw = 1800), 1-butylbromide, 1-bromoctane, 1-bromododecane, phenol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), ethylparaben (EtP), butylparaben
(BuP), octylparaben (OcP), and the other reagents are all analytical
grade and used without further purification. All water used was deionized
and double-distilled unless otherwise specified.

4.2 Characterization Techniques
An FTIR
spectrometer (model Nicolet 460) and elemental analyzers were used
to analyze the functional groups and related element contents in the
fibers, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (model Nova
450) was used to characterize the surface morphological structure
of the fibers. An X-ray diffractometer (BrukerAXS, model Ultima IV)
recorded XRD spectra. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained
using a model PHI-5000 versaprobe spectrometer. The pH values were
measured with a model PHS-25 pH meter.

4.3 Synthesis
of the Functionalized Fibers
The amphiphilic functionalized
fibers were synthesized by the following
three steps: formation of amide-functionalized fiber PPAF, preparation of aminated fiber PPA-PF, and alkylation
reaction. First, commercially available PPF was refluxed in ethanol
for 12 h to remove surface additives. The treated fiber PPF (0.5 g),
deionized water (20 g), (NH4)2SO4·FeSO4·6H2O (0.05 g), benzoyl peroxide
(BPO) (0.02 g), and toluene (5 mL) were immersed in a 50 mL round
bottom flask. The reaction system was protected by nitrogen and kept
at 65 °C for 30 min. Then, 10 g of acrylamide (AM) in 20 mL of
water was gradually added into the above reaction mixture and kept
at 85 °C for 1.5 h. After reaction, the fiber was washed with hot water and dried to
get PPAF.(Scheme 2)

Scheme 2 Construction of Amphiphilic Structure Functionalized
Fiber PPA-PF-Cn (n =
4, 8, and 12)
Second, PPAF was placed in a 15 wt % aqueous solution
of HPEI and reacted at 100 °C.36 The
aminated fiber (PPA-PF) was washed with water and
ethanol to neutral and dried.

Third, the obtained PPA-PF (0.5 g) was placed
in a solution of 15 mL of ethanol containing 0.5 equiv bromoalkane
and reacted under reflux. The final fiber was washed repeatedly with
water and ethanol until no residue remained and dried overnight at
60 °C. The weight gain (%) of PPA-PF-Cn (n = 4, 8, and 12) and the
functionality degree of the alkyl group (mmol/g) was obtained by the
following formula61 9   10  where W1 and W2 are the weights of PPA-PF and PPA-PF-Cn and MW is the molecular weight of the alkyl chain,
respectively.

4.4 Adsorption Experiment
Batch adsorption
experiments of fibers on target contaminants were carried out. The
solute molecules ethylparaben (EtP), butylparaben (BuP), and octylparaben
(OcP) were dissolved in a slight amount of ethanol and diluted with
water to obtain a range of target contaminant solutions with different
concentrations (ranging from 10 to 500 mg/L). Then, the fibers (25
mg) were added to the solution of parabens (35 mL, pH = 7) and stirred
for 24 h. Then, the fibers were taken out and the parabens concentration
of the residue was detected by a UV–vis spectrometer. The adsorption
capacity (Qe) can be obtained as stated
by the following formula62 11  where C0 (mg/L)
is the concentration of the solution before adsorption and Ce (mg/L) is the concentration at equilibrium.

4.5 Adsorption Kinetics, Isotherm, and Thermodynamics
Experiments
The kinetic experiments were carried out by placing
the modified fiber (25 mg) in each 35 mL solution (200 mg/L, pH =
5), then stirring at room temperature for the required time. The isotherm
experiments were performed at different concentration solutions. Similarly,
the thermodynamics experiments are kinetic experiments at different
temperatures (298, 303, and 308 K). After adsorption, the experimental
data were detected by a UV–vis spectrometer.
