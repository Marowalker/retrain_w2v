In this work, cationic Gemini surfactants
with different alkyl
chain lengths (n = 8, 10, and 12) and a bipyridyl
spacer were synthesized and tested as corrosion inhibitors for carbon
steel in 1 M HCl solution. The corrosion inhibition efficiency was
determined by weight loss measurement, potentiodynamic polarization,
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that such
three inhibitors could effectively inhibit the corrosion of carbon
steel in 1 M HCl solution, especially at their low concentrations,
while the carbon chain length of Geminis used played a negligible
role in the inhibition efficiency. Scanning electron microscopy/energy
dispersive X-ray analysis observations demonstrated the formation
of a protective inhibitor layer on the carbon steel surface. Additionally,
the adsorption of the inhibitor molecules on the carbon steel surface
was found to obey the Langmuir isotherm.

1 Introduction
Carbon steel, as a main construction material, is widely used in
many engineering fields, such as the oil and gas transmission, power
production, desalination, petroleum, food, and chemical and electrochemical
industries because of its low cost, good mechanical properties, and
easy availability for fabrication of vessels.1−3 However, carbon
steel is highly sensitive to corrode in different aggressive media,
especially in the acidic environment.4,5 Unfortunately,
acid solutions are widely used for industrial descaling, cleaning,
oil well acidification, and in petrochemical processes.6 To date, several methods have accordingly been
employed to control these corrosion processes. In this regard, the
use of corrosion inhibitors is the most practical method due to many
advantages, such as economy, high efficiency, environmental friendliness,
and wide applicability in various fields.7,8

In general, the inhibitors can adsorb onto a metal surface through
the so-called physisorption and/or chemisorption and thus form a protective
barrier layer against metal corrosion in aggressive environments.9 Here, the former involves electrostatic attraction
between charged metal surface and oppositely charged inhibitors, while
the latter requires fulfilling charge sharing or charge transfer of
lone-pair and/or π electrons from conjugated moieties of inhibitor
molecules to empty d-orbitals of the metal surface. Besides, as for
the aromatic systems, the π* orbital can also accept the electrons
of d-orbital of iron to form feedback bonds, thereby producing more
than one center of chemical adsorption action.10 As a result, most organic compounds that were used as corrosion
inhibitors can be adsorbed on metal surface via heteroatoms, such
as nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and phosphorus, multiple bonds or aromatic
rings, and oppositely charged groups relative to the charged metal
surface, like quaternary ammonium salts.11 A typical class of organic inhibitors is surfactants due to the
special amphiphilicity of their molecular structures, which can be
readily synthesized with low cost and have high effectiveness and
efficiency for the inhibiting corrosion.11−13 Over the last
3 decades, Gemini surfactants have aroused remarkable interest in
the interfacial and colloid field. Gemini surfactants are composed
of two amphiphilic moieties linked by a spacer group at or near two
head groups,14,15 affording a great number of unique
performances, such as lower critical micelle concentrations (CMCs)
and C20 (the surfactant concentration
at which the surface tension is decreased by 20 mN m–1), better solubilizing abilities, greater wetting, foaming and lime-soap
dispersing properties, and stronger biological activities, compared
to conventional single-tail-and-single-head surfactants.16 More recently, an increasing concern has been
focused on the investigation of the inhibition behavior of Gemini
surfactants in various aggressive media, most of which have exhibited
high effectiveness exceeding 90%.17 In
particular, the roles that the nature of spacers and the length of
alkyl chains in Gemini molecules play in the inhibitive performances
have extensively been investigated to date.18−20 However, most
of such Gemini surfactants contained single functional groups20,21 or a variety of combinations of double functional groups22−24 among heteroatoms, conjugated and charged head groups, whereas few
of them included these triple functional groups simultaneously.18,25 In principle, the effectiveness of inhibitors is strongly related
to the formation of their adsorbed layers on the metal surfaces, mainly
influenced by the chemical nature and structure of inhibitors and
the charge of metal surfaces as well. Therefore, the effect of Gemini
surfactants having heteroatoms, aromatic rings, and polar head groups
on the inhibitive corrosion remains to be investigated. Also, we noted
that the addition of halide ions might promote the inhibition performances
of cationic Gemini surfactants,26−28 and thus its influence on halide
ions was explored in this work.

In the present work, our primary
goal was 3-fold: (i) to test the
effect of Gemini surfactant simultaneously bearing heteroatoms, aromatic
rings, and quaternary ammonium head groups on the inhibitive behaviors,
(ii) to determine the extent to which the multiple interactions between
inhibitors and metal surface influence the inhibitive performances,
and (iii) to examine the effect of the addition of halide ions on
the enhanced inhibition performances of Gemini surfactants. To address
these issues, we designed and synthesized a series of novel cationic
Gemini surfactants, 2,2′-bipyridyl-5,5′-dimethylene-bis(N,N′-dimethylalkylammonium bromide),
referred to as n-Bpy (here, n denotes
the carbon atom number of alkyl chains, n = 8, 10,
and 12), as shown in Chart 1. Herein, n-Bpy was selected as corrosion
inhibitors of carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution. The anticorrosion
performance of n-Bpys was investigated by weight
loss measurements, electrochemical measurements (potentiodynamic polarization
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), and surface assessment
techniques (scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS)). Additionally, 0.1 M potassium iodide as a secondary
species was added to the simulated corrosion solution to define the
effect between halide ions and n-Bpys. Results show
that n-Bpys exhibit a comparable and even superior
inhibition efficiency, especially at low concentration, compared to
those reported in previous work.25,29,30

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Weight Loss Measurements
The inhibition
efficiency and corrosion rate, obtained from the weight loss method
at different concentrations of n-Bpys and in the
mixed solution of 10–5 M n-Bpys
plus 0.1 M KI, are summarized in Table 1. The corrosion rate (v) is calculated
as follows 1  where w0 and w are the weight values
without and with n-Bpys, respectively, S is the surface area of carbon
steel sheet, and t is the immersion time. The inhibition
efficiency (η) together with the surface coverage (θ)
was calculated according to the following equation 2   3  where v0 and v are the corrosion rate values
in the absence and presence
of n-Bpys, respectively.

As is apparent, weight loss measurements
reveal that the addition
of n-Bpys suppresses the corrosion process markedly.
Two striking features appear: (i) n-Bpy exhibits
good inhibition efficiencies at low concentrations, e.g., even as
low as 10–7 M; and (ii) the inhibition efficiency
increases with n-Bpy concentrations, accompanied
with the decreasing corrosion rate, and attains about 83, 88, and
89% for 8-Bpy, 10-Bpy, and 12-Bpy at 10–4 M only,
respectively. These results suggest that n-Bpys are
excellent inhibitors, especially at their low concentrations. Additionally,
we examined the influence of temperature on the inhibitive performances
of 12-Bpy and found that the effect of varying temperature (in a lower-temperature
range, <318 K) on the inhibition corrosion efficiency is almost
negligible, while the efficiency value is greatly reduced at a higher
temperature (338 K) (see Figure S1).

For a compromise among the inhibitor concentration, corrosion rate,
and inhibitive efficiency, the concentration of 10–5 M appears to be an optimal choice for such three inhibitors. Accordingly,
at such an n-Bpys concentration (10–5 M), we investigated the influence of the addition of iodide ions
on the inhibitive performances of iron. Herein, the inhibition efficiency
increased by ∼11, 6, and 5% for 8-Bpy, 10-Bpy, and 12-Bpy,
respectively, and the percentage of inhibition efficiency reached
up to around 93, 92, and 91%, after the addition of iodide ions into
1 M HCl solution with 10–5 M n-Bpys.
This result indicates that introducing iodide ions can improve the
value of the inhibition efficiency. Additionally, the variation of
inhibition efficiency with inhibitor concentration would be further
confirmed by the following potentiodynamic polarization and EIS results.

2.2 Potentiodynamic Polarization
Figure 1a reveals the cathodic
and anodic polarization curves for the carbon steel in 1 M HCl without
and with the addition of different n-Bpy concentrations.
Herein, only 8-Bpy curves are given, while those of 10-Bpy and 12-Bpy
are shown in Figure S2. Obviously, the
addition of n-Bpys results in shifts in both the
cathodic and anodic curves but with different extents, and this inhibition
effect becomes more prominent as the n-Bpy concentration
is increased, evidenced by the fact that both anodic and cathodic
current densities gradually decrease with the n-Bpy
concentrations as a whole. Additionally, Figure 1b depicts the potentiodynamic polarization
curves for carbon steel in 10–5 M 8-Bpy solution
in the absence and presence of 0.1 M KI (those of 10-Bpy and 12-Bpy,
see Figure S3). Herein, the corrosion current
density decreased sharply in the presence of 0.1 M iodide ions, compared
to that in the iodide-free solution.

carbon steel in 1 M HCl
(a) without and with different concentrations of 8-Bpy; (b) blank,
blank + 10–5 M 8-Bpy and blank + 10–5 M 8-Bpy + 0.1 M KI.

The polarization curves displayed a reasonable linear Tafel
region
in both anodic and cathodic branches. Therefore, to obtain more information
about the kinetics of the dissolution process of carbon steel, the
related electrochemical parameters, including corrosion potential
(Ecorr), corrosion current density (Icorr), anodic Tafel slopes (βa), cathodic Tafel slopes (βc), and the inhibition
efficiency (η%) values, were determined and compiled in Table 2. The inhibition efficiency
(η%) values of the inhibitors were calculated using Icorr values as formulated with the following
equation 4  where Icorr and Iinh are uninhibited and inhibited corrosion
current densities, respectively, obtained from the extrapolation of
cathodic and anodic Tafel lines to the corrosion potential.

Apparently, the addition of n-Bpys
leads to a
sharp reduction in the corrosion current densities (Icorr), and moreover, the Icorr value further decreases with increasing n-Bpy concentration,
while the inhibition efficiency increases. Herein, the Icorr value shifts from 0.6025 mA cm–2 (blank) to 0.1044 mA cm–2 (8-Bpy), 0.0913 mA cm–2 (10-Bpy), and 0.0795 mA cm–2 (12-Bpy),
at its concentration of 10–7 M alone, whereas their
inhibition efficiencies increased separately up to 82.7, 84.8, and
86.8%, respectively. This result suggests that n-Bpys
show a great inhibition effect even at a low concentration. In particular,
the cathodic Tafel slope (βc) increases with concentrations
in the presence of n-Bpys, while the anodic slope
(βa) decreases, and meanwhile, the change in βc is larger than that in βa, the anodic slope.
In addition, no definite tendency in the shift of Ecorr values is observed as the n-Bpy
concentration is increased, and the maximum Ecorr shift is 59 mV. Taken together, the variation in βc and βa and the shift in Ecorr imply that n-Bpys behave as mixed-type
inhibitors and act on both the hydrogen evolution reaction and metal
dissolution, but with a predominant control of the cathodic reaction.31,32

We also investigated the influence of adding iodide ion on
the
inhibitive performances of iron, as mentioned in the previous section.
After the addition of KI into 1 M HCl solution with 10–5 M n-Bpys, the corrosion current density decreases
remarkably compared to that in the solution without KI. The inhibition
efficiencies increase by ∼14, 17, and 13% for 8-Bpy, 10-Bpy,
and 12-Bpy, respectively, and correspondingly reach up to around 93,
95, and 92% after the iodide ions are introduced in this system.

2.3 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
The EIS technique provides exact and rapid information about the
kinetics of the electrode processes and the properties of the metal
surface without destroying the adsorbed layer on the metal surface. Figure 2 shows the Nyquist
plots (a) and Bode and phase angle plots (b) for carbon steel in 1
M HCl solution without and with different concentrations of 8-Bpy.
Similar plots of the other two n-Bpys, 10-Bpy and
12-Bpy, are shown in Figures S4 and S5.
Three key issues can be obtained from Figure 2a: (i) all of the obtained impedance spectra
exhibit a single capacitive loop with a progressively incremental
diameter with n-Bpy concentrations, which suggests
that the corrosion of carbon steel in both uninhibited and inhibited
1 M HCl is usually related to the double-layer behavior and mostly
controlled by a charge-transfer process;33 (ii) the addition of n-Bpys leads to stronger dispersion
effects, compared to the blank sample, which can be attributed to
the resistance of the adsorbed n-Bpy molecules;34 and (iii) all semicircles display a slightly
depressed nature with a center under the real axis, attributed to
the dispersion in frequency due to different physical phenomena, such
as inhomogeneity and roughness of the solid during corrosion.33 Accordingly, in the equivalent circuit, a constant
phase element (CPE) is, generally, introduced to replace a true capacitor,
to account for effects of roughness and other inhomogeneities of electrodes
exactly and to determine the impedance parameters precisely.

Figure 2 (a) Nyquist
plots and (b) Bode plots for carbon steel in 1 M HCl
containing different concentrations of 8-Bpy.

Figure 3 shows
the
corresponding equivalent circuit used to analyze the impedance data.
Herein, the equivalent circuit consists of a serial connection between
a solution resistance Rs and a parallel
connection of a constant phase element (CPE) and a polarization resistance Rp, which contains the charge-transfer resistance Rct, the resistance of diffusive layer Rd and inhibitor layer Ri, and the accumulated substances at the steel surface Ra, Rp = Rct + Rd + Ri + Ra.3535Figure 4 shows Nyquist plots (a) and
Bode and phase angle plots (b) of 8-Bpy, which are perfectly fitted
by the equivalent circuit used (those of 10-Bpy and 12-Bpy, see Figures S6 and S7). The impedance of CPE in the
equivalent circuits is given by36 5  where Y0 is the
CPE constant, j is the imaginary unit, ω is
the angular frequency, and n is the CPE exponent. Y0 is converted into Cdl by the following expression37 6  where ωmax = 2πfmax represents the angular frequency at the
maximum value of the imaginary part. The inhibition efficiency was
calculated using the polarization resistance from the following equation 7  where Rp and Rp0 are the
polarization resistance values with and without n-Bpys, respectively. The impedance parameters derived from
the equivalent circuit model are compiled in Table 3.

fit the impedance data.

equivalent circuits.

Polarization
resistances Rp, closely
associated with the inhibition efficiencies, in the presence of n-Bpys were always greater than their values in the absence
of n-Bpys; moreover, their values increased as a
function of n-Bpy concentrations. These results indicate
a reduction in the steel corrosion rate when using n-Bpys as inhibitors. In contrast, the addition of n-Bpys results in an obvious decrease in Cdl values, which is a likely consequence of the adsorption of n-Bpy on the carbon steel surface.38 In this regard, the adsorption of n-Bpys would
lead to the increase of the adsorbed film thickness and/or the decrease
in the local dielectric constant. The latter case was attributed to
the fact that H2O molecules on the electrode surface were
gradually replaced by the adsorbed n-Bpy molecules
with a lower dielectric constant.39 Therefore,
the variation in Rp and Cdl as a function of n-Bpy concentrations
further confirms that n-Bpy molecules can form a
protective layer via adsorbing at the metal/acid solution interface
and prevent the metal surface against the attack of corrosive media.11

The Bode plots for carbon steel in 1 M
HCl without and with 8-Bpy
are given in Figure 2b. In Bode plots, the impedance values in the presence of 8-Bpy are
higher than those in the absence of 8-Bpy, and they augment with the
increasing concentration, further indicating the formation of a protective
layer on the surface of carbon steel. By contrast, in phase angle
plots, a single-phase peak reveals the presence of only one time constant
in the presence of 8-Bpy, due to the formation of an electrical double
layer at the solution/metal interface, and the angle increases after
the addition of 8-Bpy.40 Moreover, the
phase angle values enhanced in the presence of n-Bpys,
compared to those in the absence of n-Bpys, which
manifests that the adsorption of n-Bpys molecules
on the steel surface leads to greater smoothness of such surface.

Figure 5 shows the
Nyquist plots and Bode plots of carbon steel in 1 M HCl containing
10–5 M 8-Bpy without and with 0.1 M KI (those of
10-Bpy and 12-Bpy, see Figures S8 and S9). Obviously, the addition of iodide ions results in a remarkable
increase in the diameters of the semicircles and the impedance values;
meanwhile, in phase angle plots, a wider frequency region and a larger
phase angle are displayed. All results in Figure 5 and Table 3 demonstrate that the presence of KI leads to a remarkable
increase in the polarization resistance, Rp, but a reduced double-layer capacitance, Cdl. Similarly, these results may be ascribed to the adsorption
of n-Bpys and I– on the metal surface,
leading to the formation of a protective film on the steel surface
and in turn an enhanced corrosion inhibition. When the 1 M HCl solution
only contains 10–5 M n-Bpy, the Rp values of 8, 10, and 12-Bpy were 306.2, 365.4,
and 389.9 Ω cm2, and the inhibition efficiencies
were 77.8, 79.1, and 82.5%, respectively. However, the corresponding
inhibition efficiencies increased up to 91.9, 93.8, and 92.3% after
the addition of KI. These outcomes further indicate that iodide ions
can improve the inhibition performance.

(b) Bode plots for carbon steel in 1 M HCl

The inhibition efficiencies from EIS are in agreement with
those
obtained from the weight loss measurements and the potentiodynamic
polarization methods, but with different absolute values. This is
due to the differences in experimental methods, conditions, and the
soaking time in aggressive media.

2.4 Adsorption
Isotherm
The information
of the interaction between the inhibitor molecules and the metal surface
is generally provided by adsorption isotherms.41 Assuming a direct relationship between the surface coverage
(θ) and the inhibition efficiency (η) as θ = η/100,
weight loss measurements were used to determine the surface coverage
values (θ) for n-Bpys in this work. Herein,
the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was employed to fit the results,
given in Figure 6.
In this model, θ is related to the concentration of the inhibitors
(Cinh) by the following equation42 8  where Kads stands
for the equilibrium constant in the adsorption process. The adsorption
isotherms of n-Bpys in 1 M HCl have high correlation
coefficients (R2) of 0.9999, which is
used as a measure to determine the best-fit adsorption isotherm. In
this work, such high R2 value indicates
that the adsorption of n-Bpys on steel surface fully
obeys Langmuir isothermal adsorption. Generally, the Langmuir isothermal
adsorption postulates that no interactions occurred between the adjacent
molecules adsorbed on the metal surface.43 The equilibrium constant (Kads) was
obtained from the intercept of the Langmuir isotherm, given in Table 4. The equilibrium
constant (Kads) was used to determine
the standard Gibbs free energy of the adsorption process using the
following equation44 9  where the value 55.5 represents the molar
concentration of water in solution, R is the molar
gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.
The calculated ΔGads values are
also given in Table 4.

In general, the physisorption process is considered
to associate
with the electrostatic interaction between the charged corrosion inhibitor
and the metal surface with the opposite charge, and the corresponding
ΔGads values are usually less than
−20 kJ mol–1; in contrast, the chemisorption
process is doomed to relate with the charge sharing or charge transfer
from the inhibitor molecules to the metal surface, while the ΔGads values are commonly close to or more than
−40 kJ mol–1.45 Here, the values of ΔGads were
−48.93, −49.61, and −47.37 kJ mol–1 for 8-Bpy, 10-Bpy, and 12-Bpy, respectively. This suggests that n-Bpys can form a stable protection layer on carbon steel
in 1 M HCl solution through a typical of chemisorption mechanism.13

2.5 Surface Characterization
SEM images
and the corresponding EDS images of the freshly polished carbon steel
specimen and those of carbon steel exposed to the uninhibited and
inhibited 1 M HCl solution are shown in Figure 7. The EDS results were obtained from the
whole surface of the corresponding SEM images. The SEM image of Figure 7b reveals a rougher
surface for the uninhibited system, compared to that with the inhibited
system (Figure 7c),
which lends direct support to the anticorrosion effect of n-Bpys. Figure 7e denotes the EDS images of carbon
steel corroded in 1 M HCl solution without any inhibitor, which describes
lower characteristic signals of Fe, Mn, and Cr than those of polished
carbon steel and shows the appearance of O element, which meant the
presence of iron oxide. Furthermore, Fe peaks are considerably suppressed
and Fe content is reduced from 93.53% (for carbon steel prior to immersion)
to 73.83% (for carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution). These results suggested
that the oxide film covered specimen surface. In the presence of 8-Bpy,
the EDS images of Figure 7f show an additional peak of N indicating the adsorption of
inhibitor molecules at the steel surface. Meanwhile, the mass ratio
of Fe enhanced from 73.83 to 88.40%, while that of O dropped from
10.83 to 3.07%, compared to the specimen in 1 M HCl solution without
8-Bpy. These data indicated that inhibitors had absorbed on the surface,
resulting in a reduction of the degree of acid corrosion.

2.6 Inhibition
Mechanism of n-Bpy
Taken together, weight
loss, electrochemical, isothermal
adsorption, and morphological results suggest that the addition of n-Bpys plays a critical role in the corrosion inhibition
of the carbon steel in 1 M HCl in this work. Based on such results
and combined with the molecular structure of used n-Bpys, a schematic mechanism of the inhibition is proposed, shown
in Chart 2. Since n-Bpys bear lone-pair electrons of the electronegative heteroatom
N and π-electrons of aromatic rings and iron atoms have vacant
d-orbitals on the metal surface, which can mainly contribute to the
chemisorption,46 the coordinated interactions
would be formed readily on the metal surface. This is in good agreement
with the result of adsorption isotherms. It should be noted that the
electrons may accumulate in d-orbitals of iron atoms, which is caused
by the electron transfer during the chemisorption process and results
in interelectronic repulsions on the metal surface. At this time,
this repulsion could be abated by the reverse transfer of electrons
from d-orbitals of iron atoms to the vacant antibonding molecular
orbitals of n-Bpy molecules, known as retrodonation.47 In this work, this case is illustrated in Chart 2. Last but not least,
carbon steel is corroded in the aggressive solution, resulting in
a positively charged metallic surface. Such a surface can attract
the negatively charged counterions, such as chloride or iodide ions,
thereby affording a net result being a negatively charged steel surface.48 Accordingly, electrostatic interactions can
also occur spontaneously between positively charged n-Bpy molecules and negatively charged metallic surface in acidic
solution or in the presence of KI sometimes, which can be a contributor
to the physisorption. As mentioned above, n-Bpys
can play a key role in the corrosion inhibition of the carbon steel
as mixed-type inhibitors with a predominant control of the cathodic
reaction. The quaternary ammonium cation of n-Bpys
may adsorb on the cathodic sites of carbon steel and inhibit the hydrogen
evolution reaction, while N heteroatoms and aromatic rings may adsorb
on anodic sites of metal surface and thus reduce the anodic metal
dissolution reaction.49

Chart 2 Schematic Representation
of Possible Adsorption Interactions of n-Bpys on
Carbon Steel Surface in HCl Solution
One final point that deserves comment is a
disagreement about the effect of the alkyl chain length or carbon
atom numbers on the corrosion inhibition between the Gemini surfactants
reported in other previous works11,18,19 and n-Bpys used in this work, namely,
that the anticorrosion performance of Gemini improves as their alkyl
chain length is increased,11,18,19 while n-Bpys do not exhibit this tendency. We believed
that such a disagreement might be attributed to the orientation of
adsorbed Gemini surfactant on the carbon steel surface, which can
greatly affect the inhibition efficiency, as discussed elsewhere.21 However, the bipyridyl spacer is a rigid group.
As discussed in our previous work,50,51 it is the
rigid spacer that forces the two alkyl chains to separate, thereby
almost producing a fully extended configuration lie nearly flat on
the water surface; and only when the surface pressure is sufficiently
enough, i.e., more than 30 mN m–1, it is possible
to partially reorient both horizontal chains into a vertical arrangement.
Such a fully extended configuration of Geminis with a rigid spacer
was also evidenced by the crystallographic data52−54 from single-crystal
X-ray diffraction and the molecular arrangement at the air/water interface
from the polarization modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy
(PM-IRRAS)55 in our previous work. Especially,
in the latter case, PM-IRRAS revealed that the tilt angles of chains
with respect to the surface normal were in the range of 73–76°.
Herein, n-Bpys have a rigid bipyridyl spacer, which
may adsorb in a similarly extended mode on the steel surface (for
more details, see the analysis for π–A isotherm of 18-Bpy in Figures S10 and S11), in contrast to other Geminis whose alkyl chains are pending from
the metal surface and pointing toward the aggressive media almost
perpendicularly. Therefore, the fact that the variation in the alkyl
chain length of n-Bpys has a negligible effect on
the anticorrosion performance in this work may be attributed to the
unique molecular configuration. Herein, the CMC value of 8-Bpy, as
a representative species, was determined to be 2.22 mM, based on the
surface tension measurement (see Figure S12). Furthermore, such a simple model can also account for the differences
in the inhibition efficiency between Geminis previously reported in
other work and n-Bpys in this work, at extremely
low and medium concentrations, respectively (here, this comparison
was not conducted at high concentrations due to the solubility limitation
of n-Bpys). At extremely low concentrations, e.g.,
10–6 M, inhibition efficiencies of n-Bpys nearly exceed 75%, superior to those of the other Geminis reported
previously, while at medium concentrations, e.g., 10–4 M, they are almost more than 80%, comparable to the other values.25,29,30 This is a likely consequence
of n-Bpys having multiple interactions with the steel
surface, which is helpful for a facile and rapid adsorption with a
relatively larger surface coverage at extremely low concentrations
and the formation of a tightly adsorbed layer, thereby facilitating
an improved inhibition efficiency.

3 Conclusions
In this work, n-Bpys simultaneously bearing three
functional groups, i.e., heteroatoms, aromatic rings, and quaternary
ammonium head, have been successfully prepared and explored the inhibition
performance for carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution. Several results
of n-Bpys are listed below:1. n-Bpys effectively
act as corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution at
low concentrations, and the inhibition efficiency improved with increasing
concentration of n-Bpys. Moreover, the addition of
the iodide ions can dramatically improve their inhibitive performances.

2. Potentiodynamic polarization
curves
indicated that n-Bpys were a mixed-type inhibitor
with a predominantly cathodic control.

3. EIS measurements showed that a protective
layer was formed on the carbon steel surface according to the decrease
of the Cdl value and the increase of the Rp with increasing inhibitor concentration.

4. Adsorption of n-Bpys
on the carbon steel surface obeyed the Langmuir isotherm. The values
of ΔGads are −48.93, −49.61,
and −47.37 kJ mol–1 for 8-Bpy, 10-Bpy, and
12-Bpy, respectively, which indicate that the adsorption of n-Bpys is a typical chemisorption process.

5. SEM/EDAX images revealed a smoother
carbon steel surface in inhibited acid solution compared to that in
the uninhibited system, which suggests that a protective film was
formed on the metal surface.

6. The carbon chain length of n-Bpys played a negligible
role in the inhibition efficiency
due to the orientation of the tail chain of the molecule.



Efforts aimed at exploring the contribution
degree of each functional
group to the corrosion inhibition, with a view toward creating high-efficiency
inhibitors, are continuing in our lab.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of Inhibitors
The inhibitors
used in this work were obtained using experimental procedures similar
to those described in our previous work.53,54 In brief, an intermediate, 5,5′-bis(bromomethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine,
was obtained from a bromination reaction of 5,5′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine.
Subsequently, a quaterization reaction of 5,5′-N,N-dimethyloctylamine with bis(bromomethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine
afforded 8-Bpy. In the same way, 10-Bpy and 12-Bpy were synthesized
via the quaterization reaction of N,N-dimethyldecylamine and N,N-dimethyldodecylamine
with 5,5′-bis(bromomethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine, respectively.

4.2 Materials and Solutions
The composition
of tested specimen of N80 is (wt %): C: 0.35; Si: 0.23; Mn: 1.46;
P: 0.011; S: 0.005; Cu: 0.08; Ni: 0.01; Cr: 0.08; Mo: 0.16; V: 0.11;
Al: 0.024; Fe balance. Prior to the experiment, the specimen was washed
ultrasonically with ultrapure water, alcohol, and acetone and finally
dried in air.

The simulated corrosion solution of 1 M HCl was
prepared by an analytically pure concentrated hydrochloric acid in
a mass fraction of 36–38% (analytically pure), which was also
used as a blank sample for comparison. The concentration range of n-Bpys used for corrosion measurements from 10–7 to 10–4 M. All tests were carried out at 298 ±
1 K.

4.3 Weight Loss Measurement
The dimension
of used carbon steel specimens was 5 cm × 1 cm × 0.3 cm.
All samples were immersed in 1 M HCl solution in the absence and presence
of different concentrations of n-Bpys for 48 h. Each
condition was repeated at least three times, and the mean weight losses
were reported.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical
tests were carried out by a conventional three-electrode system, assembled
with carbon steel sheet as the working electrode, a platinum wire
as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (3.5 M KCl) as the reference
electrode, on a PARSTAT4000 electrochemical workstation (Princeton
Applied Research). A carbon steel sheet was pressed to fit into a
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) holder, while exposing only 2.9 cm2 surface to the solution.

Polarization experiments were performed
in the potential range of ±0.25 V versus the open-circuit potential
with a scan rate of 0.5 mV s–1. In the electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, the frequency range is
from 100 kHz to 10 mHz by applying 5 mV amplitude to the system. The
EIS data were fitted and processed carefully by ZSimpWin software.
It should be noted that prior to each experiment, the working electrode
was immersed in the test solution for 30 min to measure the open-circuit
potential and all experiments were repeated at least three times.

4.5 Surface Characterization
For surface
morphological investigations of the carbon steel samples in the absence
and presence of n-Bpys, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were performed using
FEI Nova Nano SEM with TEAM EDS. The specimens with size of 1 cm ×
1 cm × 0.1 cm were prepared. After the immersion in 1 M HCl solution
without and with 10–4 M 8-Bpy for 48 h, the specimens
were thoroughly rinsed with distilled water, dried, and subjected
to SEM/EDS analysis.
