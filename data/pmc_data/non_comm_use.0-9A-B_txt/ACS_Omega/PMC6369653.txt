Currently
available (photo-)electrochemical technologies for water
treatment establish a trade-off between low-pollutant concentration
and costs. This paper aims at decoupling these two variables by designing
a photo-oxidation device using earth abundant materials and an electronic-free
approach. The proposed device combines a graphite/graphite electrochemical
system with a silicon-based solar cell that provides the necessary
electrical power. First, the optimum operational voltage for the graphite/graphite
electrochemical system was found to be around 1.6 V. That corresponded
closely to the voltage produced by an a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem solar cell
of approximately 1.35 V. This configuration was shown to provide the
best pollutant degradation in relation to the device area, removing
70% of the initial concentration of phenol and 90% of the methylene
blue after 4 h of treatment. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
of these two contaminants after 4 h of treatment was also promising,
55 and 30%, respectively. Moreover, connecting several solar cells
in series led to higher pollutant degradation but lower COD removal,
suggesting that the degradation of the intermediate components is
a limiting factor. This is expected to be due to the higher currents
achieved by the series-connected configuration, which would favor
other reactions such as polymerization over the degradation of intermediate
species.

1 Introduction
Clean water scarcity is
expected to be one of the main challenges
for society in the near future,1 with about
a billion people with limited access to clean water.2 The heavy industrialization and urbanization currently
taking place are expected to increase the problem, polluting main
water sources with hazardous effluents.3 Some of the most common contaminants are organic pollutants, such
as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, phenol compounds, chloroform, or dyes.4,5 Several methods to remove organic contaminants include biological,
physical, and chemical treatments.6 However,
these methods hardly remove the pollutants to the low concentrations
needed.7,8 Many advanced water treatment processes
such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are able to achieve
low concentrations of contaminants but generally consume high amounts
of energy.8−10 Thus, the solution to tackle the polluted water problem
should also take into account the device energy needs.

Electrochemical
oxidation is a method with the potential to remove
toxic organic compounds, ecologically hazardous cyanides, and other
residual compounds even at low concentrations.4,11 This
method uses an electrical current provided by an external source to
degrade the pollutants into less complex compounds such as CO2, which are easier to remove by a post-treatment step.12,13 Moreover, it can be coupled with devices based on earth-abundant
materials that can cheaply provide the needed electrical energy to
drive the process, eliminating the energy consumption impact of the
whole device,14 combining the advantages
of low pollutant concentrations and low energy costs.

Previous
work has demonstrated devices that can successfully degrade
several organic contaminants using solar energy and earth-abundant
materials using compounds such as bismuth-based compounds,15,16 SnO2,1717 WO318,19 and TiO2.20,2120,21 However, these materials
are not able to effectively degrade organic pollutants using only
solar energy. To tackle this challenge, previous research combined
a BiVO4 photoelectrode with a thin-film (TF) silicon solar
cell and a graphite counter electrode.22 The demonstrator device was able to effectively degrade phenol and
cloroform, reducing the energy use from 4.21 W h/mg for the traditional
TiO2 to 0.79 W h/mg for the BiVO4-based bias-free
device. Nevertheless, this device is constrained by the interaction
between the BiVO4 and solar cell, since the solar spectrum
needs to be distributed among the different junctions, and the produced
current density would be limited by the photoanode. This paper aims
at further decoupling these two subsystems by designing a solar cell
based on earth-abundant materials that can provide the necessary energy
for a fully electrochemical system, without the inclusion of a photoelectrode.
This configuration relaxes the requirements for the solar device,
allowing for more flexibility of design. Moreover, by designing a
direct solar water treatment system, no converter or inverter is needed,
reducing the complexity of the system and the potential costs. However,
there are some complex interactions at play. This study aims at analyzing
the differences between using a solar cell and a voltage source to
power the electrochemical system. The main parameters analyzed were
the pollutant degradation and the chemical oxygen demand (COD).

Regarding the electrochemical system, different materials such
as Ag, Al, Au, Cu, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Ti, Zn, graphite, glassy carbon,
and activated carbon fiber have been proposed in the literature as
cathode materials in the electrochemical treatment of water containing
different organic pollutants.23 In this
work, two graphite plates were studied due to their relative low cost
with respect to other more precious metals and relatively high removal
efficiency.4

The materials available
regarding the photovoltaic (PV) cell implementation
include III–V technologies, perovskites, organics, crystalline
silicon (c-Si), TF amorphous and nanocrystalline silicon (a-Si:H and
nc-Si:H), and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS).24,25 The technological choice depends on the design requirements of the
electrochemical components. The voltage characteristics of the used
electrodes must be taken into account as one of the main variables
affecting the solar cell choice. However, unlike other configurations
such as that of an external power source, solar cells are also current
sources and thus the current–voltage interaction would play
an important role on the final performance. Thin-film silicon and
crystalline silicon technologies have been chosen as the preferred
PV technologies due to their relatively low cost, availability, and
design flexibility. Here, several different PV technologies and configurations
have been studied, including a-Si:H, nc-Si:H, and silicon heterojunction
(SHJ) solar cells. In addition, either monolithic multijunction solar
cells (Figure 1a) or
wired series-connected solar cells (Figure 1b) may be required to fulfill the voltage
requirements of the oxidation process.26−28

Figure 1 Schematic of a stand-alone
device configuration combining an electrochemical
system and (a) a solar cell, possibly multijunction, or (b) several
solar cells connected in series, which can be either single or multijunction.

By decoupling the two elements
of charge carrier generation and
collection and the redox reactions, each element can be better optimized.
Thus, the resulting device would have the potential to reduce the
costs of advanced water treatment processes by using free solar energy
and earth-abundant materials and have the additional advantage of
being electrically autonomous from any external power source. However,
to achieve such efficient devices, the interaction between the current
and voltage produced by the solar cell and the electrochemical system
must be better understood and compared with the more common case of
an independent power source.

2 Results and Discussion
A device consisting of a solar cell and an electrochemical system
for the degradation of organic pollutants in water was studied. To
understand and improve the performance of the proposed system, the
electrochemistry of the graphite plate system was analyzed first.
Then, different solar cell configurations were designed on the basis
of the identified electrochemical characteristics. The solar cells
were separately characterized and then combined with the electrochemical
system. The potential of this stand-alone device to effectively remove
organic contaminants was then determined.

2.1 Electrochemical
System Characterization
The electrochemical system, in this
context, refers to the part
of the system comprised by the two electrodes and the electrolyte.
The interaction between the electrochemical oxidation and reduction
reactions is crucial to characterize the system, and it can help to
minimize the overpotential related to the electrodes. In this work,
two graphite plates were studied due to their relative low cost with
respect to other more precious metals and high removal efficiency.4Figure 2a shows the JV characteristics of the graphite/graphite
electrochemical system. The system shows a rather high hysteresis
loop between −1 and 2.5 V. This effect could be related to
the capacitance created between the two electrodes due to the charge-transfer
barriers between the electrodes and the electrolyte. In addition,
no characteristic peak could be observed for the formation of any
intermediate compound. Previous research also has related the absence
of this peak in graphite electrodes to the fouling effect of phenol,
which passivates the electrode.29,30 Thus, to determine
if the phenol reaction occurs, Figure 2a also compares the JV characteristics
of the system with and without phenol present in the solution. When
phenol was introduced, the current at positive voltages increased,
which confirms the phenol degradation at voltage ranges between 1
and 2.5 V. Moreover, a lower hysteresis can be observed when phenol
was present, indicating that the charges can be more easily transferred
to the electrolyte. To further optimize the voltage response of the
system, degradation experiments were conducted using different potentiostat-applied
voltages ranging from 1 to 2.2 V. The results are shown in Figure 2b. The concentration
profiles observed correspond to a first-order reaction, allowing to
calculate the reaction rate constant, as plotted in Figure 2c. The R2 value of the fitting in this case was always higher than
0.99. The reaction rate constant shows a clear maximum at 1.6 V, which
also coincides with the minimum concentration and COD in the solution
after 4 h of treatment. When operating below this voltage of 1.6 V,
the charge carrier density was not enough to produce many radicals
and degrade the phenol molecules. This is indicated by the trends
in the current density, which steadily increased with voltage up to
1.6 V. After this voltage, the current density stabilized, indicating
that the charge carrier generation and separation inside the graphite
were not the limiting factors anymore. The degradation efficiency
decreased after this point due to other competing reactions such as
water splitting. Compared to other similar systems such as TiO2-based systems, the voltage needed is higher for achieving
similar currents due to the photoactivity of TiO2.31 However, in the proposed system, that photoactivity
is transferred to the solar cell, avoiding issues associated to light
absorption in the solution.

system connected
to a voltage source, (a) JV characteristics, (b)
phenol degradation at different applied potentials, and (c) the corresponding
first-order reaction constant; the current density measured flowing
through the system at each voltage and the final concentration and
COD in the sample after 4 h of degradation at different voltages.

The solar cell designed to be
integrated in this device should
have an operational voltage around 1.6 V to assure charge carrier
separation inside the semiconductor and at the same time to not surpass
the water splitting reaction potential, which would reduce the availability
of charges for the phenol degradation reaction. Instead, it is expected
that OH radicals are produced at this voltage.22 To confirm the suitability of this electrochemical system
for other contaminants, the degradation of methylene blue was also
tested. Quantitatively, the absorbance of the solution was measured
to evaluate the methylene blue removal, as shown in Figure 3. In particular, the peak at
a wavelength of 650 nm was used to evaluate the dye removal due to
its more persistent nature.32 A reduction
of the methylene blue concentration similar to previous works was
achieved,33 achieving almost complete removal
after 4 h of degradation, as observed, confirming the suitability
of these systems for a variety of organic contaminants. Moreover,
this system would be able to outperform the traditional TiO2 photoelectrodes,34 since the light absorption
in the methylene blue does not affect the graphite/graphite performance,
unlike for TiO2.

voltage of 1.6 V,
measured by the absorbance peak change with time.

2.2 Solar Cell Characterization
To achieve
the desired potential of 1.6 V, a solar device was coupled to the
electrochemical system. TF silicon solar cells and silicon heterojunction
(SHJ) cells were used due to their flexibility of design, their low
costs, and their high performance. When using TF silicon, a multijunction
approach can be used, allowing for higher operational voltages than
single junctions and better spectral utilization. The absorber thicknesses
were adjusted to optimize the output parameters, setting as boundary
condition that the a-Si:H top absorber layers would not increase further
than 300 nm to avoid strong light-induced degradation.35 In addition, flat silicon heterojunction (SHJ)
solar cells are also available. The main external parameters obtained
for each of the available cells are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 External
Parameters of the Selected
Thin-Film Solar Cells at Standard Test Conditions (STC)
solar cell type	VOC (V)	JSC (mA/cm2)	efficiency (%)	FF	
a-Si:H	0.85	18.7	9.9	0.62	
a-Si:H/nc-Si:H	1.36	12.9	10.5	0.60	
a-Si:H/a-Si:H	1.67	8.88	9.04	0.61	
SHJ	0.68	35.00	12.85	0.54	
Some of these cells produced
a voltage close to the optimum operational
voltage previously determined, namely, a-Si:H/nc-Si:H and a-Si:H/a-Si:H
cells. Thus, these cells could be tested as a single multijunction
device. However, since most of the used solar cells have operational
voltages lower than the optimum 1.6 V, several cells must be connected
in series. Here, two a-Si:H, two SHJ, two a-Si:H/nc-Si:H, and two
a-Si:H/a-Si:H were connected in series to achieve higher voltages.
Note that, even though the performance of these cells might be superior,
the solar cell area is doubled related to that of the individual cells.
Thus, a direct cost-performance comparison between the two configurations
is not possible.

2.3 Electrochemical System
Powered by a Solar
Cell
To determine the suitability of these strategies for
water treatment, the solar cells were coupled to the electrochemical
system previously described, resulting in the phenol and methylene
blue degradation characteristics shown in Figure 4. Looking at the individual cells, it can
be seen that with an a-Si:H/a-Si:H double junction solar cell, a better
degradation was reached in comparison to the case of a-Si:H/nc-Si:H.
The a-Si:H/a-Si:H cells were able to produce a higher operational
voltage, injecting charge carriers more efficiently into the solution
to drive the phenol degradation reaction.36 The produced current density remained within the same order of magnitude
for the two cells. When adding several of these cells in series, higher
operational voltages were achieved, closer to the desired value of
1.6 V. This resulted in a higher phenol degradation for the case of
two a-Si:H/nc-Si:H in series, reducing the phenol concentration by
80% after 4 h. In the case of methylene blue, all cells in series
achieved values similar to the ones for the individual a-Si:H/a-Si:H
cells, reaching low dye concentrations. Overall, connecting several
cells in series did not significantly improve the performance, since
in most cases, the voltage obtained was too high for optimum operation,
and the possible mismatches between cells can further lower the performance.

Figure 4 (a) Phenol
and (b) methylene blue degradation characteristics when
using different solar cells. The current densities reported are based
on the electrode area of 16 cm2.

Moreover, even though the system with the two a-Si:H/nc-Si:H
cells
connected in series showed the best pollutant degradation, it resulted
in the highest remaining COD values after 4 h of degradation. The
lowest final COD values for phenol correspond to the individual a-Si:H/a-Si:H
cell and the two SHJ cells in series. For methylene blue, the lowest
values were achieved with the individual a-Si:H/a-Si:H cell and the
two a-Si:H cells in series. Thus, it seems that after a certain voltage
threshold, higher operational voltages can lead to lower COD removal.
Overall, considering the achieved pollutant degradation and COD removal,
as well as the needed PV area, an a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem solar cell
appeared to be the most viable option, achieving a phenol removal
of 70% (energy use of 0.19 W h/mg phenol), a methylene blue removal
of 90% (energy use of 0.12 W h/mg methylene blue), and COD removals
of these two pollutants of 55 and 30%, respectively. Moreover, compared
to the energy use of 0.79 W h/mg phenol for a BiVO4 photoanode
connected to a solar cell,22 decoupling
the PV and electrochemical elements seems to result in a more energy-efficient
system.

When comparing the results of the solar cells (Figure 4) to those by voltage
sources
(Figure 2), some differences
can be observed. In the case of solar cells, higher current densities
can lead to lower COD, like for the two a-Si:H/nc-Si:H cells connected
in series. This suggests that, since solar cells are not only voltage
sources but also current sources, the current density must also be
taken into account. To better understand this process, the COD concentrations
and the final concentration of phenol and methylene blue are plotted
as a function of the total power density provided by the solar cell,
as depicted in Figure 5, calculated as the voltage times the current density of the solar
cell under operation. This analysis shows that higher power densities
resulted in a higher degradation of the organic molecules but a constant
or slight increase in final COD, both for phenol and methylene blue.
When the power density is high, the current densities are high at
the surface of the electrode, and more contaminant molecules (phenol
and methylene blue) are decomposed. However, the COD does not necessarily
follow the same trend because it might need different voltages, current
levels, or surface treatments, which would transfer these additional
charge carriers to other side reactions, such as the creation of polymers
that might cause fouling.37 Therefore,
the limiting factor is the degradation of the intermediate compounds,
whose formation mechanisms have been studied elsewhere.37,38 Although it could be argued that a factor leading to these results
is the relatively low oxidation potential of the graphite electrodes,
this effect was not seen when using the same electrodes connected
to a voltage source and therefore other effects must be present.

CODs after 4 h of degradation with respect to the power provided by
the different solar cell configurations. The power densities refer
to the areas of the electrodes, which are 16 cm2 per electrode.

3 Conclusions
A photo-oxidation device based on earth-abundant materials and
solar illumination was successfully demonstrated. It consists of a
graphite/graphite electrochemical system connected to a solar cell
that provides the necessary electrical power. The optimum voltage
for the graphite/graphite system was determined to be 1.6 V, at which
it can efficiently degrade both phenol and methylene blue. A thin-film
silicon solar cell was designed to operate at a voltage as close to
this value as possible. An a-Si:H/a-Si:H tandem solar cell was found
to give the best results, with phenol removal of 70% of the original
concentration after 4 h of treatment. The limiting factor of these
systems was determined to be the degradation of intermediate compounds
by the solar cell system, since the COD after degradation was higher
than that of the electrochemical device connected to a voltage source
providing the same voltage. Connecting several of these cells in series
did not significantly improve the performance, since the voltage obtained
was too high for optimum operation and the mismatches between cells
further lowered the performance. Moreover, normalizing of the results
by the active PV area, using a single multijunction of a-Si:H/a-Si:H
was the most suitable solution. In conclusion, an autonomous device
consisting of an a-Si:H/a-Si:H solar cell combined to a graphite/graphite
electrochemical system can provide an efficient way to remove organic
pollutants from water, potentially reducing the costs and the greenhouse
gas emissions of a water treatment facility.

4 Material
and Methods
4.1 Solar Cell Fabrication
All TF solar
cells were deposited by radio frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor
deposition (RF-PECVD) using a cluster tool from Elettrorava.
The a-Si:H and a-Si:H/a-Si:H solar cells were deposited on textured
Asahi UV substrates, which use fluor-doped tin oxide (FTO) as
transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The a-Si:H/nc-Si:H solar cells
were deposited in wet-etched textured corning glass with aluminum-doped
zinc oxide (AZO) as TCO. The texturing of the glass used for
the a-Si:H/nc-Si:H cell is described elsewhere.39 Nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) was used as p-layer (boron doped) and n-layer (phosphorous
doped). The deposition rates of a-Si:H and nc-Si:H were 0.16 and 0.71
nm/s, respectively. The SHJ solar cells were deposited on a flat n⟨111⟩
float zone wafer from University Wafers cleaned by subsequent steps
of HNO3 and HF baths. Then, 7 nm of intrinsic a-Si:H were
deposited in each side of the wafer, and 7 nm of p-type a-Si:H and
9 nm of n-type a-Si:H were fabricated to complete the structure. Finally,
a 100 nm layer of low power and temperature indium-doped tin oxide
was deposited on top of the p-type emitter layer as the front TCO.
No TCO was used on the back of the solar cell.

The contacts
for all cells have been deposited using electron beam physical vapor
deposition. A 300 nm Al stripe in contact with the TCO has been used
as a front contact. A stack of 200 nm Ag, 30 nm Cr, and 500 nm Al
has been used as a back reflector and back contact. The solar cell
area for all configurations was 1 cm2. Interconnections
have been performed by soldering Ag cables to the solar cell contacts.

4.2 Solar Cell Characterization
The external
quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured in an inhouse setup in TU Delft,
The Netherlands, to obtain the amount of charge carriers generated
per photon at a given wavelength. The current density–voltage
(JV) characteristics of the solar cells have been
measured using a Wacom AAA solar simulator using two lamps (Xe and
halogen) and an AM1.5 filter. The short-circuit current density has
been corrected with the obtained value from the integration of the
EQE weighted with the AM1.5 spectrum.

4.3 Photoelectrochemical
Measurements and Sampling
Electrochemical experiments for
phenol and dye degradation were
carried out on a setup consisting of a cylindrical quartz glass reactor
with an effective vessel volume of 200 mL, two graphite electrodes,
and potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT128N with a BOOSTER10A) connected
to the electrochemical system to provide the needed voltage. The potentiostat
was controlled by Nova Software, with a current accuracy of ±0.2%.40 In experiments powered by solar energy, a solar
cell was used, exposing it to an Atlas solar simulator (SUNTEST XXL+),
aiming to achieve standard test conditions (STC) of 1000 W/m2, AM1.5, and 25 °C.

The electrodes were graphite plates
with an area of 16 cm2 and were either connected to a solar
cell or a voltage source. The initial volume of the working solution
was 150 mL of either a phenol solution with initial concentration
of 20 mg/L (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) or a 25 mg/L methylene blue
solution (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich). To eliminate the influence
of solution resistance, 0.1 M Na2SO4 (≥99%,
Merck) was chosen as supporting electrolyte. Demineralized water (RiOs
5 Reverse Osmosis System) was used throughout the experiments for
dilution. At the start of each experiment, the graphite electrodes
were kept in the stirred solution in the dark for 1 h for the adsorption
at the electrode surface to reach equilibrium.31 The pH of the solution was kept constant at 7.2 and was
measured before the experiment, using a Sentix 81 pH meter. The temperature
was controlled at 25 ± 1 °C by recirculating cooling water
in a water bath equipped with cooler Julabo, FL300. During the experiments,
the reactor was closed by a UV permeable quartz lid to prevent evaporation
of phenol.

Samples of 2 mL of either phenol solution or dye
solution were
collected every hour for further characterization. Phenol reacts with
4-nitroaniline to form a yellow-colored complex, which is then measured
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Hach Lange DR 3900, cuvette
tests LCK 345 with a measuring range of 0.05–5.00, 5–50,
and 20–200 mg/L). The possible measurement error of the spectrophotometer
is ±5%.41 The methylene blue absorption
characteristics were also measured using the UV–vis spectrophotometer,
and the characteristic peak at a wavelength of 650 nm was taken as
an indication of the methylene blue concentration.42

The chemical oxygen demand (COD) describes the oxygen
required
to oxidize all soluble and particle organics. It gives an idea of
the oxidation degree of the organic pollutants in the solution. The
COD measurements were performed by using a mix containing a strong
oxidizing agent (Cr2O72–),
a small amount of silver for the more resilient organics, and mercury
to avoid possible interaction with chloride ions. After adding the
oxidizing agent, the samples were digested for 2 h and 148 °C,
after which the amount of consumed oxidizing agent was determined.
By subtracting the initial and final concentrations of the oxidizing
agent present, the consumed oxidizing agent was determined. The accuracy
of this method is considered by a standard error of ±5%.
