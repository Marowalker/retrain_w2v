We report a selective
and sensitive nanosensor probe based on polyethylenimine (PEI)-capped
downconverting nanophosphors β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI for the detection of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT),
both in water and buffer media. These downconverting phosphors were
synthesized via a hydrothermal route and are known to show excellent
chemical, thermal, and photostability. They emit sharp emission peaks
centered at ∼488, 544, 584, and 619 nm, among which the peak
at ∼544 nm was remarkably quenched (∼90%) by the addition
of TNT without giving any new emission peak. The sensing mechanism
is based on the formation of a Meisenheimer complex between the electron-rich
amine-functionalized β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ nanophosphors and electron-deficient TNT molecule, which
was prominently visualized by the change in the color of the solution
from whitish to brownish yellow, enabling visual detection, followed
by luminescence resonance energy transfer between the nanophosphors
and the complex. A linear range for TNT detection was obtained from
0.1 to 300 μM with a limit of detection as low as 119.9 nM.
This method displayed excellent selectivity toward TNT over other
nitroaromatic compounds, which had no influence on the detection.
Moreover, various other classes of analytes, viz., amino acids, pesticides,
and sugars, did not quench the luminescence intensity of the nanophosphors.
This developed nanosensor probe possesses high, stable fluorescence
brightness and capability for the selective and sensitive on-site
recognition of TNT molecules in aqueous media, avoiding complicated
strategies and instruments. Thus, this work promises to pave ways
to many applications in the detection of ultratrace analytes.

1 Introduction
The
riveting optical features of lanthanide ions such as narrow and sharp
emission bandwidth, large Stokes and anti-Stokes shift, tunable emission
spectra, long-lived emission generally in milliseconds, low autofluorescence,
and reduced blinking arise from their electronic transitions within
the 4f orbitals, hence giving them an edge over conventional fluorophores
and quantum dots.1 Having these advantages,
recently, rare earth ion-doped phosphors have been emerging as a potential
material in various applications such as solid-state lasers,2 light-emitting devices,3 solar cells,4 sensing,5 cell imaging,6 drug delivery,7,8 and so forth. One of the most propitious applications of these luminescent
phosphors is their use as the optical probes for the identification
of molecules such as glutathione,9 glucose,10 avidin,11 and ions
such as cyanide,12 mercury,13 and so forth for the sensing applications. Profound
efforts have been devoted to the development of novel, innovative,
and implicit sensors. Thus, these lanthanide ion-doped phosphors can
be applied to the highly selective and sensitive real-time and on-site
detection of the explosives.

Identification and quantification
of explosives has constituted an emerging and important topic of interest.
Reliable detection of trace amount of explosive substances is of critical
importance concerning homeland security threats, military applications,
mine-field analysis, forensic investigations, and so forth. Moreover,
these compounds are known to have toxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity,
and their release into the environment from military sites and ammunition
plants causes the contamination of water and soil.14 Because of the risk associated with the environment, human
and wildlife, the detection has gained increasing attention. The detection
could help in reducing the fatalities among the civilians and health
risk hazards.

The chemical structures of the commonly used nitrocompounds
are shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S1. In recent years, a variety of analytical techniques
and detection methods of explosives have been developed including
gas chromatography,15 ion mobility spectrometry,16 surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy,17,18 conductivity-based techniques,19 and
so forth. However, these methods are usually limited by several intrinsic
shortcomings; some require complicated instrumentation or synthetic
processes, whereas others require labeling procedures, which are typically
time-consuming, expensive, and require specialized personnel. Thence,
to meet this need, the fluorescence quenching approach has been explored
for the analysis of nitro-based explosives. Fluorescence-based sensing
methods have gained immense attention because of the relatively lower
operational costs than the conventional methods, simplicity, higher
sensitivities, portability, short response times, and its pertinence
in both solution and the solid phase. Various nanomaterials were used
to develop a fluorescence-sensing platform for explosive sensing.20−23 Although these various nanostructured materials are reported to
construct a fluorescent probe for the selective detection of the explosives,
there is still a challenge to utilize them as sensors because they
possess low chemical and thermal stability, poor aqueous solubility,
require time-consuming synthetic methods, are receptive toward photobleaching,
and thus are insufficient for the detection of analytes in aqueous
samples. Therefore, other classes of compounds based on the lanthanide
ions have garnered attention for sensing applications in the past
few years.

Because of good chemical, thermal, and photostability,
the lanthanide ion-doped phosphors are highly desirable as sensors.24 Moreover, long-lived luminescence of lanthanide
ions could allow them to be potentially used for analyte detection
in strongly autofluorescent biological matrices. These have been used
in sensing of various hazardous analytes of environmental and clinical
importance.25−27 These phosphors have also been employed for sensing
explosives via fluorescence-based detection up to a level of nanomolar
concentration. In 2014, Ma and Wang reported label-free detection
of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) using upconverting nanoparticles (NPs)
NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ at pH = 12 with a
detection limit of 9.7 ng/mL.28 In the
same year, a miniaturized device was fabricated using NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+@PEI, which detected the TNT explosive
by the formation of the Meisenheimer complex and quenched the green
luminescence.29 Although the mentioned
methods utilize the selectivity of these materials over other analogous
analytes, they involved multistep and time-consuming synthetic processes.
Also, these sensors worked in the high pH range (12 and above), thus
limiting their applicability as sensors. Nevertheless, β-NaYF4;Gd3+,Tb3+ downconverting nanophosphors,
being highly luminescent, have rarely been explored for their potentiality
as a fluorescent probe for the selective and sensitive detection of
explosives.

In this contribution, we have developed a label-free
method for the selective detection of TNT, in the aqueous solution
of nitrocompounds, characteristic to explosives based on the green-emitting
phosphors. These lanthanide ion-doped phosphors are functionalized
with amine groups (NH2) using PEI via a hydrothermal route.
The detection is based on photoluminescence (PL) method by observing
the change in intensity at 544 nm of the green light which was selectively
and dramatically quenched via luminescence resonance energy transfer
(LRET)-based energy transfer from nanophosphors to the Meisenheimer
complex, detailed mechanism of which is explained. Meanwhile, the
intensity was not influenced by the addition of other nitrocompounds
in the aqueous solution. Furthermore, no drastic change in intensity
was observed with other category of analytes such as amino acids,
pesticides, and sugars. The current developed sensing probe is also
applicable in a wide pH range from 7 to 13. Combined with good water
and chemical stability, photostability and wide pH adaptability will
facilitate the application of this system as a potential nanosensor
probe.

2 Results and Discussion
The composition,
crystallinity, and phase purity of the NaYF4 nanophosphors
were first checked by powder XRD as shown in Figure 1. The sample diffraction peaks can be indexed
to NaYF4 with lattice parameters as a =
5.9 Å, and c = 3.5 Å, that is in good agreement
with standard JCPDS data (JCPDS no. 16-0334), confirming the hexagonal
phase of the as-synthesized product. The detailed structure analysis
was carried out with the Rietveld refinement method using the general
structure analysis system, GSAS–EXPGUI suit of programs.30 The refinement proceeded smoothly with the Na1.5Y1.5F6
model (ICSD collection code no. 51917) and the corresponding profile
is displayed in the Supporting Information in Figure S2. The lattice parameters and reliability factors are
summarized in Table S1. The background
was fitted well with a shifted Chebyschev function and all the parameters
including unit cell parameters, occupancy, Gaussian–Lorentzian
factors were refined. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Figure 2a,b) show that the
β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI particles
prepared at 180 °C are grown in rod-shaped particles and exhibit
uniform shapes and are monodispersed with an average diameter of ∼92
nm and length of ∼280 nm. The contrast in the TEM image observed
was due to the different orientation of the crystalline nanoparticles
with respect to the electron beam, which changed the elastic scattering
diffraction and thus appeared in different contrast. Further, the
chemical composition of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ nanophosphors was characterized by energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDXA) where all the elements in the nanophosphors
could be detected including doped Gd3+ and Tb3+ ions, confirming the presence of the lanthanide ions (Figure S3). Furthermore, the detailed structure
analysis was done through high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis explained
in Figure S4a, which shows the HRTEM image
of the pristine sample, which was subsequently analyzed by a combination
of fast Fourier transform (FFT) followed by inverse FFT (IFFT) image
to check crystal lattice periodicity. Figure S4b shows the IFFT image of the selected region (marked as the red square)
in the HRTEM image, which was constructed after the masking of the
(110) plane using the Digital Micrograph software as shown in the
FFT image in the inset. The IFFT image clearly shows the presence
of an array of ordered planes whose interplanar spacing was measured
from the line profile and was 0.30 nm, corresponding to the (110)
plane of the hexagonal NaYF4 lattice. The SAED pattern shown in Figure S4d revealed
the crystalline nature of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI NPs.
The diffraction pattern obtained matched well with the crystal planes
of hexagonal NaYF4 and have been assigned to the (110),
(101), and (111) planes. Thus, d-spacing calculated
in HRTEM and SAED are in agreement with those given in the standard
JCPDS data no. 16-0334, confirming the hexagonal phase of the as-prepared
samples.

of hexagonal NaYF4, JCPDS 16-0334 as the reference.

spectra indicating the capping of PEI on the surface of the rods.
Inset: Zoomed view in the range of 3000–2500 cm–1, (d) TGA results confirming the presence of PEI on the terminus.
The decomposition temperature obtained for branched PEI when coated
on the surface is ∼510 °C, as shown in the derivative
curve of TGA in the inset. Bare β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ phosphors without the capping of PEI, showed no
weight loss at this temperature.

The functionalization of PEI was investigated by zeta potential
of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI NPs,
which was +43 mV, suggesting the successful capping of PEI on the
surface, rendering the rods to be positively charged. The presence
of amino groups on the surface of rods was further verified by Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure 2c). The β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI nanophosphors exhibited an absorption band at
3446 cm–1 because of typical N–H stretching
vibration of the amino groups, which overlaps with the O–H
stretching band and its presence is supported by the peak ascribed
to the bending mode of amino groups (−NH2) at 1656
cm–1, thus revealing the abundance of electron-rich
amino groups on the terminal of the rods.7 Moreover, the absorption band at 1398 cm–1 is
attributed to the stretching vibrations of the C–N bond, whereas
the bands at 2857 and 2937 cm–1 are attributed to
the methylene symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching vibrations
as shown in inset of Figure 2c. The PEI capping is further confirmed by thermo gravimetric
analysis (TGA) results, which were carried out in nitrogen atmosphere
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. As shown in Figure 2d, the initial weight loss
of 5.5% occurred in the temperature range 300–550 °C due
to the degradation of bound PEI present in the system and no further
loss was observed till 650 °C, confirming the stability of the
fluorides. The inset shows the first derivative of the TGA curve,
confirming the presence of PEI in the system and degradation at 510
°C. The TGA spectra were recorded for bare β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ nanophosphors, which showed a slight
weight loss of 2.1 wt % in the 300–550 °C temperature
range. It is believed that the decomposition temperature of branched
PEI is situated at around 400 °C in nitrogen atmosphere,31 which can be verified in the TGA results shown
in Figure S5. The observed increase in
the decomposition temperature of PEI in the β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI as compared to free PEI is attributed
to the fact that the capping agent is protected from degradation because
of its binding to the rods.32 This confirms
that the PEI is indeed bound to the nanorods.

The composition
and chemical state of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI were ascertained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements. As shown in Figure 3a, the survey scan spectrum confirmed the presence
of Na, Y, F, C, N, and lanthanides (Gd, Tb) in the material. It should
be mentioned here that the presence of C 1s and N 1s in the spectrum
was due to the capping of the PEI on the surface. The high-resolution
peak analyses of Gd 3d and 4d core level spectra revealed that these
energy levels are split into doublet because of spin-orbit coupling
(Figure 3b,c). The
energy levels 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 appeared at 1189.2
and 1220.9 eV, respectively, with spin–orbit splitting of 31.9
eV, whereas the peaks at 144.8 and 150.4 eV can be assigned to the
binding energy of levels 4d5/2 and 4d3/2, respectively.
The presence of Gd 3d and 4d peaks showed that the Gd ion exists as
Gd3+ in the crystal lattice of hexagonal NaYF4. As shown in Figure 3d, the energy level of Tb 3d also split into doublet corresponding
to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 at 1243.7 and 1278.4 eV,
respectively. Also, a satellite appeared between the two main peaks.
These results suggested that the Tb ion substituted Y ion in NaYF4 appeared in only one oxidation state, i.e., +3. The magnified
XPS spectra of other elements such as Na, Y, and F in β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI is shown in Figure S6, displaying the energy levels; Na 1s,
Y 3d, and F 1s core levels. The surface functionalization of the downconverting
nanorods conducted by XPS was in accordance with the FTIR results.
The presence of these functional hydrophilic groups improved the water
dispersibility and stability of the nanorods. To explore the local
structure of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ crystals, Raman spectroscopy was recorded to analyze the vibrational
properties of the sample under the laser 325 nm (Figure S7). The Raman spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ crystals revealed the strongest phonon bands
at 308, 367, 416 cm–1, which are in fair agreement
with reported data of the NaYF4 lattice.33 These bands are attributed to the host lattice vibrations
of Y–F and Na–F distances and bond strength features.

Gd 4d, and (d) Tb 3d showing the binding energy of the core levels.

The optical emission spectra of
β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI are displayed
in Figure 4a, where
the photon emission originates from the transition within the 4f electronic
transitions of Tb3+ ions. The emission spectra of Tb3+ ions can be obtained at the excitation wavelength, λex = 375 nm.34 The efficient emission
is difficult to realize in the system containing Tb ions under direct
excitation at 375 nm due to intraconfigurational parity-forbidden
transitions. Hence, Gd3+ ions act as a sensitizer (i.e.,
light-harvesting antenna) to enhance the luminescence of Tb3+ ions.7 As Gd3+ ions exhibit
a strong absorption band at 273 nm because of their 8S7/2 → 6I11/2 transition corresponding
to f–f transitions, nanophosphors containing Gd3+, Tb3+ ions together exhibit a very intense excitation
band at 273 nm followed by a nonradiative (nr) energy transfer to
Tb3+ ions. The emission peak of Gd3+ is observed
at 311 nm in the UV region, which is assigned to the 6P7/2 → 8S7/2 transition under 273
nm irradiation.35 Additionally, the obtained
emission spectra excited at λex = 273 nm (Figure 4a) yielded emissions
from Tb3+ ions in the range of 480–680 nm. Four
prominent emission peaks centered at ∼488, ∼544, ∼584,
and ∼619 nm originate from the transitions of 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 7F4, and 5D4 → 7F3, respectively. It is clear that among the above
mentioned transitions, the green emission 5D4 → 7F5 at ∼544 nm is the most
intense emission. The PL decay curve for the luminescence of Tb3+ in β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI nanorods is shown in Figure 4b. Here, we displayed the PL decay curve fitted over
first 20 ms with biexponential decay functions because of the variation
in decay rates of Tb3+ ions in the nanoparticles. This
emissive biexponential decay is ascribed to the inhomogeneous distribution
of Tb ions close to the surface, giving the short lifetime, and inside
the nanoparticles with a long lifetime.36 The curve was well fitted by decay equation: I = Io + A1(e–x/τ1) + A2(e–x/τ2), where I and Io are the intensities
at times x and 0, respectively, A1 and A2 are constants, τ1 and τ2 are the decay times for the two exponential
components, which were 0.35 and 2.50 ms for 5D4 → 7F5 electronic transition of Tb3+ under excitation at 375 nm. The average lifetime of these
nanophosphors is in milliseconds, indicating the usability of these
phosphors in biological applications also where the autofluorescence
and background fluorescence can be suppressed offering high signal
to noise ratio.37

2.1 Detection of Explosives
Nitro group-based
compounds, 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP),
2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene
(2,6-DNT), TNT, 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazinane (RDX), 4-nitrophenol
(4-NP), 1,4-dinitrobenzene (1,4-DNB), nitromethane (NM), 4-nitrotoluene
(4-NT), and nitrobenzene (NB) were used in this experiment. The designed
principle of detection is based on the interaction of the amine groups
on the surface of the nanoparticles with the electron-deficient nitrocompounds.
For comparison, the PL intensity of nanophosphors was detected in
deionized water at ∼544 nm. Equal amounts of analytes were
taken in a cuvette for the measurements as discussed in the synthesis
section and compared against the PL intensity in the deionized water.
It is interesting to note that among these explosive samples (Figure 5a), only TNT could
quench the PL intensity of the nanophosphors. Figure 5b presents the quenching profile for all
the analytes for the emission at 544 nm. One can see in the figure
that the quenching efficiency for 300 μM TNT is about 90%, whereas
all other analytes contributed little changes in the luminescence
intensity. On the basis of the results mentioned, TNT was recognized
as a detection target owing to its ability to quench the luminescence
dramatically, suggesting the high sensitivity of the sensing probe.
As a result of the significant quenching, we next studied the quenching
phenomenon with varied concentrations of TNT (Figure 5c). As shown in Figure 5d, under the optimum conditions in our experimental
procedure, the PL quenching was analyzed using the Stern–Volmer
(SV) plot between the change in PL intensity at 544 nm and the concentration
of TNT. A significant linear correlation (R2 = 0.998) existed between the relative PL intensity (Io/I) and the concentration of TNT in
the range of 0.1–300 μM. The quenching efficiency was
investigated using S–V equation, Io/I – 1 = Ksv [Q],
where Io is the PL intensity in the absence
of analyte, I is the PL intensity in the presence
of analyte with the molar concentration [Q], and Ksv is the quenching constant in M–1.
The quenching constant was determined to be 3.32 × 104 M–1. The limit of detection (LOD) of TNT can be
found using the linear regression method and calculated using the
formula 3σ/m, where 3 is the factor of 99%
confidence level, σ is the standard deviation of the measured
intensity for the blank β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI nanophosphors (n = 5), whereas m denotes the slope of the linear calibration curve. It
should be mentioned here that the LOD was found to be 119.9 nM (27.2
ppb), revealing higher sensitivity of the as-synthesized nanophosphors
compared to the other earlier reported results (Table S2).

samples containing β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI and different nitrocompounds (300 μM) in aqueous
solution, (c) emission spectra of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI containing different concentrations

of the linear S–V plot for TNT by equation; Io/I – 1 = Ksv[Q], where Ksv is quenching constant
and found out to be 3.32 × 104 M–1. The error bar is calculated from three parallel samples.

2.2 Interference
Study
To assess the possibility of the analytical application
of our phosphor-based nanosensor in terms of the sensitivity, the
effect of different mixed samples of analogous compounds of TNT such
as 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, 4-NP, 1,3-DNB, TNP, 2,4-DNP, RDX, 1,4-DNB, NM,
4-NT, and NB: 300 μM on the quenching of PL intensity was also
studied and the results are shown in Figure 6a. In spite of the presence of other analytes,
quenching of the PL intensity owing to the TNT was observed, having
no interference because of the other analytes. Therefore, they show
high sensitivity and selectivity for the detection of specific nitrocompounds.
The TNT quenching was also observed in the buffer solution, NaH2PO4–Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0).
Furthermore, we scrutinized the effects of pH on the PL intensity
before and after the addition of TNT. In the wide range of pH 7–13,
it showed no variation in the luminescence intensity (Figure S8a), suggesting the stability of the
nanophosphors over the wide range of pH in the neutral and alkali
environments. In addition, the influence of incubation time on the
luminescence intensity was also studied to ensure the quenching solely
because of TNT. As seen in Figure S8b,
the intensity at 544 nm was quenched with the addition of TNT after
10 min. Meanwhile, by prolonging the incubation time to 48 h, the
PL intensity was almost unchanged. Moreover, the PL intensity remained
unchanged for almost 8 months, when stored at room temperature. This
demonstrates that these nanophosphors can detect analytes over a long
period of time, and thus are stable in nature. It should be mentioned
here that no quenching was observed when only β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ was used for the PL measurements
without being capped by PEI (Figure S9).
Therefore, we can say that the interaction of the TNT molecule with
amino groups plays an important role.

300 μM), (e) photograph showing the complex formation, which
is confirmed by the change in the color of the solution to brownish
yellow containing TNT, whereas other samples look white or pale yellow.

2.3 Mechanism
of Highly Selective Detection
To unravel the origin of the
high selectivity of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI nanophosphors toward TNT, the quenching mechanism was
investigated. A plausible mechanism for the detection could be proposed
to be based on the donor–acceptor interaction between amino
groups of phosphor nanorods and TNT. As TNT is an electron-deficient
compound because of the presence of three electron-withdrawing nitro
groups, it acts as an electron–acceptor, whereas amino groups
are electron donors. Thus, an electron transfer mechanism takes place
between TNT and amino groups of the PEI on the surface of nanoparticles,
which leads to the formation of the Meisenheimer complex (Scheme 1). The three electron-withdrawing
nitro groups present at the ortho- and para-position in TNT enables
the nulceophile amino groups to attack at position 1 (where the methyl
group is attached) in the molecule, which leads to the formation of
this stable anionic σ-complex where the negative charge is delocalized
over the ring.38 The formation of such
a complex with amino groups is typical of nitrocompounds, especially
TNT. This complex formation can be confirmed by the change in the
color of the solution of nanophosphors containing TNT to brownish
yellow (Figure 6e),
whereas there was no color change in the case of 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT,
4-NT, 1,3-DNB, 1,4-DNB, NM, and RDX. A pale yellow color appeared
in the case of 2,4-DNP, 4-NP, NB, and TNP, which can be easily distinguished
from the brownish yellow color of TNT. The UV–vis spectra of
the explosives in the presence of PEI-capped nanophosphors were recorded
and are shown in Figure 6b. As it can be seen, all other nitrocompounds have a strong absorbance
before 400 nm, and hence do not interfere in the quenching. Meanwhile,
it should be mentioned that the Meisenheimer complex formed with the
TNT and nanophosphors has a broad absorbance in the range 400–650
nm, which overlaps with the emission of the Tb3+ ions in
the phosphors (Figure 6c). As the emission from the nanoparticles overlaps with the absorbance
of the complex formed, it gives the possibility of LRET-based energy
transfer, thereby leading to the quenching of the green emission.
As mentioned above, when lanthanide ion-based nanoparticles are used
as the energy donor, the mechanism is named as LRET, whose principles
are similar to fluorescence resonance energy transfer and defined
as an nr optical energy transfer between a donor D in its excited
state and proximal ground state acceptor A through long-range dipole–dipole
interactions.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Formation of the Meisenheimer
Complex Due to the Interaction between the Amino Group Present on
the Surface of the Phosphor Nanoparticles and TNT through the Charge-Transfer
Mechanism in Aqueous Medium
For effective energy transfer, an acceptor absorption
spectrum should overlap with a donor emission spectrum and the donor
and acceptor should be linked in close proximity.39 In Figure 6b, it is observed that the absorption spectrum of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI + TNT largely overlaps
with the emission spectra of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI phosphors, whereas there is no overlap with
other analytes, thereby avoiding energy transfer. Although there is
a suitable spectral overlap between the nanophosphor emission and
the complex absorption in the UV–vis spectra, LRET cannot occur
unless the donor and acceptor are close enough. Because of the formation
of the complex between TNT and amine groups, it is brought close enough
for the energy transfer to take place. Thus, the spectral overlapping
between downconversion emission of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI and absorbance of the Meisenheimer complex,
and the close distance between the two manifests the LRET efficiency
of the sensor. Meanwhile, in order to ascertain the above mentioned
reason, we explored the lifetime of nanophosphors with varied concentrations
of TNT. As displayed in Figure 6d, the lifetime of the β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI phosphors decreased with increasing concentrations
of TNT, and average lifetimes were considered for consistency in results.
The decay was fitted using a biexponential decay function to yield
average lifetimes of 2.11, 1.91, 1.72, 1.49, and 0.98 ms under the
TNT concentrations of 0, 1, 10, 100, and 300 μM, respectively. Table S3 shows the lifetime parameters, viz.
τi, rel %, and average lifetime
of the samples. These results excluded the possibility of inner filter
effect; thus, the lifetime reduction indicated that LRET is the major
process40,41 between nanophosphors and the TNT complex
as it offers the additional relaxation pathway. As mentioned above,
the nanosensor exhibited high selectivity for the target TNT over
other nitrocompounds with similar structures such as TNP, DNT, DNP,
NP, and DNB. Other nitrocompounds are much weaker electronic acceptors
when compared with TNT because of lack of electron-withdrawing nitro
groups, and thus are not likely to form an effective Meisenheimer
complex with the amine groups present on the surface of the nanoparticles.42 Although weak interactions may lie between the
amine groups and these compounds, no significant absorption peaks
are detected in the UV–vis spectra in the spectral range of
400–700 nm; thus, they do not interfere with the emission of
the downconverting nanophosphors. The proposed method demonstrates
the feasibility of the PEI-capped β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ phosphor nanoparticles’ application
for preferentially detecting TNT as the analyte.

2.4 Interference from Other Analytes
In order to illustrate
the good selectivity, sensitivity, and feasibility of the developed
nanosensor probe for the detection of TNT, the effects of other analytes
such as pesticides, sugars, and amino acids were also checked on the
luminescence quenching profile and the results are shown in Figure 7. The stock solution
of 300 μM of the following amino acids was prepared in water:
phenylalanine, isoleucine, tryptophan, glutamine, glutamic acid, and
histidine. The structures of all the analytes are given in Figure S10. Interestingly, among the amino acids,
none of them showed any obvious quenching effects in the intensity
of the nanophosphors. This is due to the groups present in the structure
of the amino acids, which did not interact with the amine group in
the PEI and thus are not able to form a complex with the nanorods.
Similarly, stock solutions of some pesticides such as chloropyrifos,
malathion, cypermethrin, copper oxychloride, fenvalerate, and carbendazim,
and sugars such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, lactose, and
sorbitol (Figure S10) were also prepared
and incubated for 10 min before the PL measurements. The findings
in Figure 7 indicate
that these analytes did not show any significant change in the intensity
of the nanophosphors. Thence, it can be seen that this nanoprobe sensor
promised to be an intriguing indicator for the existence of any risks
and threats from the explosives, thus assuring us of our security.

showing the selectivity of the phosphors over other analytes such
as amino acids, pesticides, and sugars. There was no obvious change
observed in the PL intensity, suggesting the selectivity toward TNT.

3 Conclusions
In summary, an approach has been reported for selective detection
of TNT over a number of other analogous nitrocompounds using β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI nanophosphors based on
fluorimetric sensing technique. The results from various characterization
methods suggested the formation of β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ nanophosphors capped with PEI. The excellent
selectivity toward TNT is ascribed to the interactions of the amine
group present in PEI and nitro groups in TNT forming the Meisenheimer
complex, which has caused a decrease in the PL signal because of the
LRET-based energy-transfer mechanism between the nanophosphors and
the complex formed. The PL intensity variations have displayed that
the nanophosphors were sensitive and efficient for the explosive detection
with a LOD of 119.9 nM (27.2 ppb). To further note the advantages
of our work, we investigated the PL intensity of the nanophosphors
with other analytes and no obvious effects were observed. Thus, the
proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of the PEI-capped β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+ phosphor nanoparticles’
application for detecting TNT as the analyte independent of complicated
instruments and immunoassays.

4 Methods
Warning! Nitrocompounds, viz., TNT, TNP, and RDX, are highly explosive and
therefore should be handled carefully in small amounts with proper
safety precautions. In Figure S1, we have
shown the chemical structure of some of the nitro explosives.

4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
All the chemicals were of analytical
grade and were used without further purification; yttrium nitrate
hexahydrate (Y(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.89%),
gadolinium nitrate hexahydrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.89%), and terbium nitrate hexahydrate (Tb(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.89%), PEI (with Mw = 25 000 and Mn =
10 000), TNP, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, 2,4-DNP, RDX, phenylalanine,
cysteine, isoleucine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, lysine,
histidine, and glutamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. TNT
and RDX were purchased from HEMRL, Pune. NaCl, Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and NaOH were received from Thomas Baker. NH4F was received from Merck. Dextrose, glucose, sucrose, fructose,
lactose, and maltose were received from Himedia laboratories Pvt.
Ltd. 1,3-DNB, 4-NP, 2,4-DNB, NM, 4-NT, NB, copper oxychloride, cypermethrin,
malathion, fenvelerate, carbendazim, and chloropyrifos were purchased
from a local company and used as received. Ethanol was obtained from
Hayman Ltd. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis
4.2.1 Synthesis of Amine-Functionalized
β-NaYF4:15%Gd3+, 5%Tb3+ (β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI)
Downconverting
NaYF4 nanophosphors were prepared using the hydrothermal
method reported earlier.7,43 Briefly, 10 mL of 0.2
M solutions of Y(NO3)3, Gd(NO3)3, and Tb(NO3)3 were added in a 10 mL
solution of NaCl (0.2 M). The solution was continuously stirred for
nearly 30 min. Thereafter, 10 mL of PEI (10 wt %) was added followed
by the addition of 20 mL of ethanol. In the resultant solution, 0.5
M of NH4F was added dropwise. Finally, the mixture was
poured in a Teflon container with 100 mL capacity and reaction was
set for 24 h at 180 °C. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature,
and the green luminescent nanophosphors were obtained after washing
with water and ethanol thrice. Then, the product was dried under vacuum
at 70 °C overnight.

4.2.2 Preparation of Stock
Solutions
For the PL study, 300 μM stock solution of
the analytes was prepared in deionized water and a fixed amount of
β-NaYF4:Gd3+,Tb3+@PEI was added to the desired concentrations levels in
a 1 mL quartz cuvette (path length of 1 cm). The mixture was then
incubated at room temperature for 10 min before the spectral measurements.
The luminescence spectra of the solutions were measured at an excitation
wavelength of 273 nm and emission data were collected in the range
of 400–700 nm. Each measurement was repeated at least thrice
and consistent results were recorded. The feasibility of the probe
was also investigated in buffer solution with pH 7 to pH 13. For pH
ranging from 7 to 8, NaH2PO4–Na2HPO4, pH ranging from 9 to 11 NaHCO3–Na2CO3–NaOH and pH ranging from 12 to 13 KCl–NaOH
were used.

4.3 Characterization Techniques
The phase purity and crystallinity of the as-synthesized samples
were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction using a PANalytical
X’PERT PRO instrument and the iron-filtered Cu-Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54 Å) in the 2θ range of 10°–80°
covered in a step size of 0.08° with a count time of 2s. The
operating voltage and current were kept at 30 kV and 40 mA, respectively.
The specific structural details and morphology were obtained by using
an FEI Tecnai T20 transmission electron microscope equipped with a
super-twin lens (s-twin) operated at 200 keV voltage. To analyze the
shape and size of the samples, FESEM (Hitachi S-4200) was done. EDXA
of the samples was performed during FESEM measurements to obtain the
elemental composition of the samples. The XPS spectra were recorded
on Thermo Fisher Scientific Instruments K Alpha + with monochromatic
Al Kα as the X-ray source with 6 mA beam current and 12 kV voltage.
A PALS Zeta Potential Analyzer Ver 3.54 (Brookhaven Instrument Corps.)
was used to determine the zeta potentials (ζ). Deionized water
was the dispersion medium. The FTIR spectrum was recorded by a PerkinElmer
spectrum two FTIR spectrophotometer with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and scan speed of 32 scans/min. TGA was done using
SDT model Q600 of TA Instruments Inc., USA, at a heating rate of 10
°C/min under continuous flux of nitrogen at 100 mL/min. Raman
spectroscopy measurements were recorded at room temperature on an
HR 800 Raman spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon, HORIBA, France) equipped
with an achromatic Czerny–Turner type monochromator (800 mm
focal-length) with silver-treated mirrors. Monochromatic radiation
emitted by a 325 nm laser, operating at 20 mW, was used. PL spectra
were acquired using a Cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer,
equipped with a 400 W Xe lamp as an excitation source with excitation
and emission slit width of 10 nm and a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier
tube as a detector. The UV–visible spectra were taken on a
Cary 300 absorbance spectrometer. PL decay dynamics were carried out
on FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instruments).
