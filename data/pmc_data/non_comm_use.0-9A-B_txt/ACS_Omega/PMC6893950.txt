The ability to research individual cells is important for various
biological studies. Currently reported biointerfaces for single-cell
analysis can only trap individual cells in random morphologies. Cell
polarity is a key factor in cellular functions, and the study of single-cell
polarity can facilitate an understanding of cancer metastasis and
stem-cell differentiation. For single polar cell trapping, anisotropic
honeycomb-structured films were prepared. Elastic poly(1,2-butadiene)
honeycomb films with ordered hexagonal pores were first prepared via
the breath figure method. Subsequently, the films were subjected to
mechanical stretching and fixed via photo-cross-linking under UV light
irradiation. This stretched honeycomb structure was then transferred
to a polystyrene surface. The resultant anisotropic porous films exhibited
excellent capacity for single-cell trapping. Besides contributing
to the physical spatial confinement of cells, the trapped single cells
exhibited orientation in different polarities. The single polar cell
array provided a novel platform for fundamental biological research.

Introduction
Conventional cell analysis methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction,
which have been extensively applied in biological research.1 These analysis methods are used to detect cellular
processes and responses by measuring a group of cells and producing
an average result, based on the assumption that there is no difference
between individual cells in cell populations. However, it is very
difficult to obtain sensitive signals from an overall analysis of
many cells. Specifically, conventional population-based cellular analysis
cannot detect cellular heterogeneity.2 Furthermore,
cell-to-cell interactions have been proven to influence cellular behaviors,
so investigating these interactions can provide insights into real
cell–material relationships. For example, the differentiation
of stem cells on two-dimensional culture platforms is usually realized
by adding growth factors, which might also be influenced by intercellular
communications. Cells with multiple biological interactions cannot
be used to determine intrinsic cellular principles. Recently, cellular
heterogeneity has attracted increasing attention to cell-to-cell differences
in response to internal or external stimulation. Given this demand,
single-cell analysis technology has rapidly developed.

In the analysis of single cells, to prevent interference from cell–cell
interaction, trapping or immobilizing individual cells is a fundamental
task. Numerous techniques have been developed to create microarrays
that can trap single cells, based on the guidance of optical, magnetic,
electrical, centrifugation, ultrasonic, pressure, and hydrodynamic
forces.3−8 Among these techniques, microfluidic arrays have been most commonly
applied for their ability to simultaneously immobilize many single
cells and enable in situ observation over time.9 However, their complicated fabrication and the associated
expense of photolithography and soft lithography have hindered the
commercialization of these chips.10,11 In addition,
most of the trapped cells are always kept in round traps, which might
influence their cellular functions.

Cell polarity is a common feature of many different cell types
and is an essential factor in differentiating and determining the
function of most cells.12,13 Cell polarity refers
to the concentration of certain cytoplasmic components in a certain
spatial order, which results in a concentration gradient of various
cell contents. Cell polarity is very important for normal cell function
and plays a key role in many biological processes, including cell
differentiation, cell migration, cytokinesis, and tissue and organ
formation.14,15 Loss of polarity is also related
to disease states such as cancer.16−18 However, such polarization
for single-cell analysis has remained unclear. Herein, it is urgent
to develop single polar cell trapping techniques to study locally
polarized cell behaviors.

In this study, we employed the breath figure method to fabricate
porous films with an average pore diameter of 18 μm.19 After fabrication, the films were physically
stretched, photo-cross-linked, and replicated to produce stable anisotropic
holes with a tunable aspect ratio (Scheme 1). Using the patterned substrates, the effects
of size and aspect ratio on cell pseudopodia and polarization were
investigated. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous
reports on the control of polarity when performing single-cell trapping
and analysis. The simple method proposed in this work provides a novel
platform for the analysis of single polar cells in biological research.

Scheme 1 Honeycomb-Patterned Polybutene (PB) Films Were Prepared Using a Typical
Breath Figure Approach, Followed by Mechanical Stretching of the Elastic
PB Films
The honeycomb films with a series
of stretched ratios were then cross-linked and fixed via UV irradiation.
Subsequently, the anisotropic honeycomb structures were applied for
single-cell trapping.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of Stretched Honeycomb Surface
PB honeycomb
films have been reported by Shimomura et al., which were incorporated
with an amphiphilic polymer as emulsifier to balance the uniformity.20 However, the diameter of the pores in that study
was only about 6 μm, which was too small for trapping cells.
Meanwhile, the used amphiphilic copolymer was hard to be obtained.
For larger hole size, pure hydrophobic PB was used for honeycomb films.
According to the principles of the breath figure technique, morphological
characteristics such as pore diameter and depth can be easily modulated
by changing the preparation conditions.19 In this study, the preparation conditions were optimized first by
changing the PB concentration, environment humidity, and airflow (Figure S1). As shown in Figure 1a,d, a relatively ordered honeycomb structure
can be obtained on PB film with a diameter of 18 ± 2.0 μm
at an airflow rate of 50 mL/min and at 65% humidity. As well known,
the diameters of most studied eukaryotes range from 10 to 20 μm.
Therefore, the honeycomb pores provide size-matched cavities for trapping
cells. Furthermore, the depth of the honeycomb pores also plays a
critical role in trapping cells, limiting cell motion, and preventing
intercellular interactions. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the honeycomb films reveal that the depth of the original
holes was approximately 6 ± 0.35 μm (Figure 1g–i).

models. (j) Average transverse and longitudinal lengths of the stretched
honeycomb. (k) Ratios of longitudinal and transverse lengths on different

For the polar cell trapping, anisotropic structures were prepared
by physical stretching. Flexible PB films were stretched to lengths
1.5 times and 2.0 times the original films and then fixed with glue
onto glass slides (Figure S2). Subsequently,
the PB films were UV-cross-linked and transferred to polystyrene (PS)
(Figure S3). The stretched honeycomb structures
exhibited an anisotropic shape with the larger axis along the stretching
direction. Round holes were obviously changed to thin elliptical shapes
after being stretched to twice their original length (Figure S4). The precise diameters along the transverse
and longitudinal axes were quantitatively measured and shown in Figure 1j. During the stretching,
there was an obvious increase in the longitudinal diameter but a slight
decrease in the transverse diameter. The anisotropy of the honeycomb
structures was evaluated by the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse
diameters (Figure 1k), which exhibited a linear relationship with the degree of stretching.
Therefore, the degree of anisotropy can be easily modulated by directly
changing the stretching length. Furthermore, the depth of the honeycomb
pores was nearly maintained, thus providing physical barriers to intercellular
communications (Figure 1l).

Wettability of Anisotropic Honeycomb Surfaces
The surface
wettability was determined by two factors, namely chemistry and morphology.
As mentioned above, the stretched honeycomb films exhibited anisotropic
morphologies, which might lead to anisotropic wetting behavior. As
a proof of concept, the water contact angles (WCAs) were measured
along the transverse and longitudinal axes. The WCA of the original
honeycomb film shown in Figure 2 was about 70°, which is slightly hydrophobic because
of the inherent hydrophobicity of PS and the surface pore structure.
After being stretched, the WCA along the transverse axis increased,
whereas that along the longitudinal axis decreased. This is because
the transverse diameter of the elliptical pores was smaller than that
of the longitudinal diameter, resulting in higher roughness and more
energy barriers in transverse direction for wetting.21 The anisotropic wetting behavior of anisotropic structures
might influence cellular adhesion and deformation (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 WCAs of various stretched honeycomb films. Anisotropic wettability
was evaluated in the longitudinal and transverse directions.

Biocompatibility of Prepared Stretched Honeycomb Surfaces
We evaluated the viability of cells on original and anisotropic
honeycomb films. Both L929 cell and 293t cell suspensions at a concentration
of 105 cells/mL were seeded onto the surfaces. After incubation
for 24 h, the nucleus of trapped cells was stained with live/dead
(AO/EB) assay. The nuclei of all adhered cells were stained with green
fluorescence indicating good viability. The viability of cells was
approximately 100%. No difference was observed between these films,
indicating that both original and anisotropic honeycomb films were
biocompatible for cell adhesion. Under reflection mode, the honeycomb
walls portrayed a vivid boundary of each holes. The captured cells
can be obviously located in honeycomb holes individually, which proved
that the honeycomb films fabricated via the breath figure method can
be used for single polar cell trapping (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Fluorescent images of live/dead (AO/EB) stained cells (L929 and
293t) on anisotropic surfaces after incubation for 15 and 24 h. The
scale bar is 80 μm.

Single-Cell Trapping
Honeycomb structures with ×1.0,
×1.5, and ×2.0 anisotropies and an original diameter of
18 μm were used to study cell-trapping behavior. To visualize
the trapping process, the cells were prestained with live fluorescent
calcein-AM. The cell immobilization on the honeycomb films might be
influenced by various factors, such as the settle time and cell density.
Cell adhesion is reported to occur quickly, within 40 min after cell–substrate
contact.22 Here, a cell settle time of
1 h was selected, which was long enough for cell adhesion to occur,
and a series of concentrations ranging from 104 to 106 cells/mL were applied to optimize the cell-trapping experiment.
The percentage of honeycomb holes that contained cells is referred
to as cell occupancy. The percentage of individually immobilized cells
among all the trapped cells is referred to as the single-cell ratio
(efficiency), which can be used to evaluate the cell-trapping capacity
on different substrates.

Figure 4a–c shows the effect of cell density on trapping
efficiency. When seeded with a low concentration of cells, nearly
all the cells were individually immobilized in honeycomb holes, with
a high single-cell trapping efficiency (Figure 4a). However, because of the lack of enough
cells, cell occupancy was relatively low. Therefore, the overall trapping
amount and single-cell efficiency were unacceptable. By increasing
the cell concentration to 105 cell/mL, there was an obvious
increase in cell occupancy (Figure 4b,d). At the same time, the single-cell ratio was well
maintained when compared with that shown in Figure 4a. With respect to the concentration of 106 cells/mL, the cell occupancies of all the honeycomb films
were improved to approximately 80%, but the single-cell ratio declined
significantly (Figure 4e). The unstretched honeycomb films maintained a single-cell ratio
above 60%, which might be attributed to the spatial barrier. The longitudinal
length of the honeycomb holes on the ×2.0 anisotropic film increased
to 35 μm, which might accept two or more cells. Therefore, several
cells may get trapped in a stretched honeycomb cavity, which would
result in a low single-cell ratio. Taking both cell occupancy and
the single-cell ratio into consideration, the concentration of the
seeding-cell suspension was optimized to be 105 cells/mL.

and anisotropic honeycomb films. The concentrations of cell suspensions
were regulated from 104 (a), to 105 (b), and
106 cells/mL (c). The scale bar is 100 μm. Cell occupancy
on different honeycomb films (d) and corresponding single-cell trapping
efficiency (e).

Polarity of Single Trapped Cells on Anisotropic Honeycomb Films
Cell morphology is largely influenced by the surrounding microenvironments,
including stiffness, roughness, curvature, and charge.23 The SEM images vividly show the cell polarity
in anisotropic holes after culturing for 8 h (Figure 5a,b). Because of spatial confinement, 293t
and L-929 cells maintained their spherical shapes on the original
honeycomb surfaces. However, significant changes in cell shape were
observed in the cells in the stretched anisotropic honeycomb holes.
These cells spread along the direction of the longitudinal axis and
had more substantial pseudopods. The one-axis elongation in the ×2.0
anisotropic hole, namely, its polarity, was larger than that in the
×1.5 anisotropic hole. This is speculated to be due to a synergistic
effect between the intrinsic cell polarization and anisotropic cue
from the wettability and the confined space and roughness of the stretched
honeycomb surface. A large number of studies have reported the effect
of micro–nano structures on cell morphology and have proved
that cells can transmit external environmental information inside
cells through receptors on their pseudopodia and that the cytoskeleton
can make adaptive adjustments that result in changes in cell morphology.24 However, this is the first study of the polarization
of a single cell inside a cavity, which differs from the behavior
of the cell population. This research is significant for the study
of single-cell behavior and single-cell analysis.

honeycomb films after culturing for 8 h. The scale bar is 10 μm.
Confocal fluorescent images of immunostained 293t (c) and L-929 (d)
cells on anisotropic honeycomb films after culturing for 8 h. The
scale bar is 15 μm. In the images, blue is the nucleus stained
by 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI),
green is the adhesion protein stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled antivinculin, and red is the cytoskeleton stained by
rhodamine phalloidin.

To further investigate the individual cell polarity in anisotropic
honeycomb surface, immunofluorescence staining was conducted to trace
cytoskeleton and distribution of focal adhesion proteins. The red
actin microfilament shows the integral shape of the cell in accordance
with SEM results, that is, a cell in the original hole had a round
spherical shape, whereas it was elongated in the anisotropic cavity.
Vinculin, a component of focal adhesion proteins, plays a significant
role in cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell deformation.25−27 The vinculin expression in the cell trapped in the original honeycomb
structure was weak and tended to aggregate in the middle of the cell
to some extent. With an increase in the anisotropy, the distribution
of vinculin occurred more and more around the two cell polarities.
In particular, the intensive green fluorescence at the front ends
of the pseudopods can be observed from cells on the ×2.0 anisotropic
surface, which indicates polar cell growth (Figure 5c,d).

Growth in the polar cells was further demonstrated by the cell
spreading area and aspect ratio with time (Figure 6 and S5). In the
earlier period of cell adhesion (4 h), the spreading area and aspect
ratio of cells on different substrates were similar. After culturing
for 6 and 8 h, the cells trapped on isotropic surface still exhibited
nonpolar morphologies and were slightly spread. However, the cell
spreading area on the anisotropic surface increased sharply, accompanied
by an increase in the aspect ratio. Focal adhesion kinase (illustrated
by vinculin) was also found to be distributed along the longitudinal
direction (Figure 5c,d), and the cytoskeleton was also regulated and arranged along
the longitudinal direction. Therefore, single cells trapped in anisotropic
honeycomb cavities exhibited polar growth. In addition, the prepared
anisotropic honeycomb films can also be applied for analyzing cancer
cell (illustrated by HeLa cell in Figure S6), demonstrating a common platform for single polar cell analysis.

individual L929 cells after being trapped in anisotropic honeycomb
films.

Conclusions
In conclusion, ordered honeycomb-structured films with a cell-matched
diameter were prepared via the breath figure method. The honeycomb
films were stretched to obtain cavities with ×2.0 and ×1.5
anisotropy. The prepared honeycomb films exhibited good single-cell
trapping capacity via the separation and locking of individual cells
in each honeycomb hole. Because of the spatial confinement, the individually
trapped cells were observed to grow and develop polarity inside the
stretched honeycomb cavities. Single-cell trapping in honeycomb films
and polar cell growth in anisotropic cavities might have a broad applicability
in single-cell studies for biological research.

Experimental Section
Materials
Chloroform and ethanol (analytical purity)
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai,
China, without further treatment. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
precursor (184) was obtained from DOW Chemical Co., USA. Poly(1,2-butadiene)
(PB) with an average Mw of 200 000–300
000 g/mol was purchased from Sigma. PS (average Mw 250 000 g/mol) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane
were supplied by Acros. 293t and L-929 cells were purchased from the
Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy
of Science. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) were supplied by Gibco. Other reagents
for cell culture and dye for cell staining were all purchased from
Beyotime Biotechnology.

Characterizations
The morphologies of the prepared
honeycomb substrates were imaged on a FlexSEM 1000 (Hitachi, Japan).
The honeycomb films were also submitted to optical microscopy (Olympus,
China) using optical transmission mode. The WCAs of patterned surfaces
were measured on OCA 10 (DataPhysics, Germany), and the measurements
were then recorded along and against the stretching orientation using
4 μL of water droplets for each test. All fluorescent images
were obtained using an inverted fluorescence microscope (DMi 8, Leica,
Germany) under optical reflection mode.

Fabrication of Honeycomb Scaffolds
According to the
method described in the literature,19,20 PB (250 mg)
was dissolved in chloroform (10 mL) and the solution was then cast
onto a glass substrate and placed in a self-prepared chamber with
variable humidity. The honeycomb structure was formed on the PB surface
at a designed level of humidity using the breath figure approach.
To obtain an anisotropic structure, the films were then stretched
using a tensile machine (HY-0350). The stretched PB films were then
fixed by photo-cross-linking under UV irradiation at a power level
of 18 W for 12 h.

To obtain a stable substrate, the patterns
on PB were replicated by performing two transfers to PS substrates
that are frequently used for cell culture, as shown in the schematic
in Figure S4. The stretched PB films were
first functionalized with a monolayer of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane
by vapor phase deposition for 12 h. The PDMS precursor with a curing
agent (the ratio of PDMS to curing agent was about 10:1) was then
cast onto the functionalized PB substrate. After curing the PDMS,
the PS chloroform solution (0.1 g/L) was cast onto the PDMS template
to obtain PS films with a stretched honeycomb structure.

For more information of substrates, the parameters including diameter
and depth of anisotropic honeycomb films were statistically measured
on more than six SEM images using Nanomeasurer software.

Cell Trapping and Culture
To trap single cells, the
PS honeycomb films were first rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and then sterilized using medical ethanol and UV irradiation.
Before performing the trapping test, the biocompatibility of the films
was evaluated by live/dead (AO/EB) dual staining and seeding the cell
suspension at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/mL.
The cells on the elongated PS honeycomb films were then cultured with
DMEM (containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin) in
a humidified cell incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere for
5, 10, 15, and 24 h.

After the cell compatibility test, single-cell
trapping was performed at different cell concentrations (104, 105, and 106 cells/mL, respectively), using
epithelial cells (293t) and fibroblasts (L929) as modules. The cell
suspensions were seeded onto the elongated honeycomb PS films for
1 h. Then, unattached cells were removed and rinsed using PBS, and
a fresh cell culture medium was added to continue the culture process.
Live cells were then stained using dye (calcein-AM) to make the captured
cells visible and enable calculation of the single-cell capture efficiency
on substrates with different stretching ratios. The polarity of the
single cells that had been trapped in the honeycomb pores were determined
and recorded at 4, 6, and 8 h, respectively.

Immunofluorescence Staining and Cell Morphology
To
obtain more detailed information about the adhered cells, the cytoskeleton
and adhesion protein expression were imaged via immunofluorescence
staining. The trapped individual cells on the honeycomb films were
fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for 10 min. Then,
the cells were rinsed with PBS three times and permeabilized with
an enhanced immunostaining permeabilization solution (Beyotime Biotechnology)
for 10 min. To resist nonspecific adhesion, the cells were blocked
with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. Then, an FITC-labeled
antivinculin monoclonal antibody (1 μg/100 μL in PBS and
blocked by 0.5% BSA) was used to immune-stain the distribution of
cellular adhesion proteins by incubating the cells for 45 min. The
remaining antibody solution was taken away and washed with PBS four
times (5 min each) to remove unbound antibodies. Rhodamine-labeled
phalloidin (100 nM in PBS with 0.5% BSA) was then added and incubated
for 45 min, after which the unbound phalloidin was rinsed with PBS.
Finally, DAPI was applied to observe the morphologies of the cell
nuclei. After sealing, the stained cells were imaged using a confocal
laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM880, Carl Germany).

SEM
was also used to obtain morphological information about the trapped
cells. The cells were primarily fixed using 5% PFA, and these fixed
cells were treated with gradient ethanol solutions (30, 50, 70, 95,
and 100%; each concentration for 15 min) to remove water from the
samples. The fixed cells were dehydrated in a dryer at room temperature.
After being sputtered with a conductive ion layer, the cell morphologies
were observed using the FlexSEM 1000 (Hitachi, Japan).

Statistical Analysis
The experimental data were collected
at least three times unless otherwise stated. The mean values were
presented as ±standard deviation and tested using a one-tailed
heteroscedastic t-test. Differences were statistically
significant at p < 0.005.
