Multichannel nerve guide conduits
(MCNGCs) have been widely studied
and exhibited outstanding nerve repair function. However, the effect
of the geometric structure of MCNGCs on the nerve repair function
was still not clear. Herein, we postulated that MCNGCs with different
inner surface area-to-volume ratios (ISA/V) of the channels inside
the nerve guide conduits (NGCs) would show different nerve repair
functions. Therefore, in current work, we constructed a series of
hydroxyethyl cellulose/soy protein sponge-based nerve conduit (HSSN)
with low, medium, and high ISA/V from hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)/soy
protein isolate (SPI) composite sponges, which were abbreviated as
HSSN-L, HSSN-M and HSSN-H, respectively. These NGCs were applied to
bridge and repair a 10 mm long sciatic nerve defect in a rat model.
Finally, the influence of ISA/V on nerve repair function was evaluated
by electrophysiological assessment, histological investigation, and
in vivo biodegradability testing. The results of electrophysiological
assessment and histological investigation showed that the regenerative
nerve tissues bridged with HSSN-H and HSSN-M had higher compound muscle
action potential amplitude ratio, higher percentage of positive NF200
and S100 staining, larger axon diameter, lower G-ratio,
and greater myelination thickness. Furthermore, the regenerative nerve
tissues bridged with HSSN-H also showed higher density of regenerated
myelinated nerve fibers and more number of myelin sheath layers. On
the whole, the repair efficiency of the peripheral nerve in HSSN-H
and HSSN-M groups might be better than that in HSSN-L. These results
indicated that higher ISA/V based on HEC/SPI composite sponge may
result in greater nerve repair functions. The conclusion provided
a probable guiding principle for the structural designs of NGCs in
the future.

Introduction
Peripheral nerve lesions often cause the
lack of sensory and motor
functions, decreasing the life quality of patients.1 In clinic, numerous surgeries have been carried out each
year for repairing nerve injury. For short defects, end-to-end coaptation
is an appropriate treatment in nerve injury.2−4 However, when
the nerve lesion is extensive (≥10 mm), a graft is needed to
bridge the transected nerve.5,6 The graft not only provides
the structural support to stabilize the injury and architecture to
direct axonal elongation but also supports cell infiltration and limits
the scar formation.1,7 Unfortunately, it is still hard
to achieve the complete recovery of nerve functions. Although the
autologous nerve graft is the gold standard in nerve repair, it also
has several limitations, such as the need of an extra incision, the
loss of the donor nerve function, limited availability of the donor
nerve, and mismatch in size between the donor nerve and the injured
nerve.8−10 Therefore, the substitution of autograft is demanded
to repair extensive nerve lesion.

With the development of tissue
engineering, the nerve guide conduits
(NGCs) have provided a promising alternative for nerve repair without
sacrificing natural nerves.11 NGCs provide
a permissive chamber for nerve regeneration, preventing the invasion
of fibrous tissue and allowing the transected stumps sprouting in
the lumen.1 In the past decades, natural
or synthetic biomaterials had been applied to construct NGCs and exhibited
considerable nerve repair function in experimental and clinical work.
At first, the structure design of NGCs was mainly focused on single
lumen. However, recent studies have indicated that multichannel NGCs
(MCNGCs) were superior to NGCs with a single channel in nerve repair.
This can be explained as follows:10,12−19 (1) the longitudinally arranged channels inside the conduits can
function as required microtubes with large surface areas for the synthesis
of lamina basalis and impose significantly positive effects on neurite
extension and attachment, proliferation, and migration of Schwann
cells; (2) inside the conduits, the multiple channels orientated lengthways
are capable of reducing the dispersion of axonal branches and in turn
promote axonal elongation; and (3) the longitudinally arrayed multiple
channels can reduce the misdirection ratio of regrown axons or polyinnervation
of various targets. Therefore, MCNGCs have been regarded as more suitable
candidates than NGCs with a single channel.

From the existing
studies,10,20 the regeneration process
of peripheral nerve was influenced not only by the number and diameter
of channels inside the MCNGCs but also by the inner surface area of
the channels inside the MCNGCs. However, among the above factors,
the factor which played a key role in influencing the scaffold performance
and nerve regeneration was still not clear. Several studies have shown
that the inner surface area-to-volume ratio (ISA/V) of the channels
inside the NGCs could systematically reflect the influence of diameter,
cross-sectional area, and surface area of the channels inside the
MCNGCs on nerve repair.20−23 These studies prompted us to investigate the ISA/V
of the channels inside the NGCs. In addition, it has been indicated
that melt-spun fibers with a high ISA/V promote efficient cell seeding
and subsequent cell proliferation, which facilitate the nutrient transportation
and spatial distribution of cells.21 In
addition, a high ISA/V provides a suitable microenvironment for biological
elements (e.g., enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, cells, and tissue
sections).24 Thereupon, we postulated that
the MCNGCs with a larger ISA/V would show better nerve repair efficiency,
whereas the smaller diameter and larger inner surface area of the
channel inside the MCNGCs could promote nerve regeneration. Moreover,
if the tunable degradation rate of NGCs can match the rate of nerve
regeneration, it will avoid a second surgical procedure and show great
advantages in the process of nerve repairing.9

In our previous study, we fabricated a series of hydroxyethyl
cellulose
(HEC)/soy protein isolate (SPI) composite films.25 The composite films exhibited a relatively high mechanical
strength, an adjustable water uptake ratio and moisture absorption
ratio, biocompatibility, and controlled degradation rate in vitro
and in vivo, indicating a great potential for biomedical applications.
Additionally, our other work has demonstrated that cellulose/SPI composite
sponge NGCs have better nerve repair function than cellulose/SPI composite
film NGCs.26 Because of the higher biodegradability
of HEC than cellulose, we supposed that the NGCs fabricated from the
HEC/SPI composite sponge would be promising in nerve repair. Because
of the difficulty in varying only one parameter without varying other
structural parameters, it is hard to design and control the geometrical
factors of NGCs. Therefore, to verify our hypothesis, we prepared
a series of HEC/SPI-based MCNGCs with different ISA/V by adjusting
the number and diameter of the channels using our handmade mold. Finally,
the nerve repair function of these MCNGCs was evaluated in an extensive
nerve lesion rat model with regards to the commonly adopted parameters
of peripheral nerve regeneration by using a variety of histological
and electrophysiological techniques.

Results
Structure of
HSSN (Hydroxyethyl cellulose/soy protein sponge-based
nerve conduit)
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
and porosity distribution of HSSN-L, HSSN-M, and HSSN-H are shown
in Figure 1. These
sponge conduits display a regular cylindrical shape with a homogeneous
porous structure. The pore sizes of three types of conduits range
from 20 to 200 μm. As shown in Figure 1, the pore size distribution of HSSN-H seemed
to be shifted toward the higher pore size. This is mainly because
the sponge was divided into more regions because of more channels
during the fabrication of the sponge conduit. As a result, the water
within the sponge was squeezed toward less space. Therefore, under
freezing, ice crystals get bigger, resulting in a larger pore size.
This kind of porous structure might be helpful for the nutrition and
air exchange and cell or tissue invasion and might promote the biodegradability
when these conduits are used as in vivo implantations. As shown in Table 1, according to the
structure design in advance, all of the conduits have a length of
12 mm and an outer diameter of 3.5 mm, whereas the diameters of the
inner channels in HSSN-L, HSSN-M, and HSSN-H were 1.5, 0.8, and 0.5
mm, respectively. As a result, the calculated ISA/Vs were 2.67 for
HSSN-L, 5.00 for HSSN-M, and 8.00 for HSSN-H. Thus, the ISA/V increased
with increasing numbers and decreasing diameters of the inner channels
in the conduits.

Electrophysiological Evaluation
Representative compound
muscle action potential (CMAP) recordings at the injured side in each
group are shown in Figure 2A. Compound action potentials were clearly observed in HSSN-L,
HSSN-M, and HSSN-H groups at 3 months after the surgery, indicating
a functional recovery of the injured nerves. Both the CMAP amplitude
(Figure 2A) and the
calculated CMAP amplitude ratio (Figure 2B) in these groups increased with the increase
of ISA/V. The CMAP amplitude ratios of HSSN-L, HSSN-M, HSSN-H, and
autograft groups were 44.32 ± 4.93%, 53.62 ± 9.10%, 56.05
± 5.79%, and 61.65 ± 5.34%, respectively. The CMAP amplitude
ratio in the HSSN-L group was lower than that in the autograft group
(P < 0.05). However, there was no significant
difference in the average CMAP amplitude ratio among HSSN-M, HSSN-H,
and autograft groups (P > 0.05). These results
indicated
that the recovery of electrophysiological properties in nerves bridged
with HSSN-M and HSSN-H approached the autograft group and surpassed
the HSSN-L group.

control and expressed as the CMAP amplitude ratio (B). (n = 10; * P < 0.05, compared with autograft group).

Histological Assessment
of Regenerated Nerves
HE Staining Analysis
Three months
after the surgery,
the regenerative nerve tissues were harvested and stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin
(HE). As shown in Figure 3, a bundle of newly regenerated nerve fibers extended inside
the conduits from the proximal stump and aggregated to a fasciculate
structure. A few new blood vessels (indicated by the black arrows)
and connective tissues were observed in the regenerated nerve fibers.
However, the distribution of the regenerated axons in the HSSN-L group
was more scattered than that in HSSN-M and HSSN-H groups, indicating
better regeneration of nerve fibers in HSSN-M and HSSN-H groups.

Double NF200 and S100 Immunofluorescence
Analysis
Figure 4A shows the double
NF200/S100 immunofluorescence image of the longitudinal section of
the regenerated nerves. The immunopositivity percentages for NF200
and S100 presented the densities of axons and Schwann cells in the
whole regenerative nerve bridged with HSSN-L, HSSN-M, and HSSN-H (Figure 4B). As shown in Figure 4A, the migrated Schwann
cells and regenerated axons were observed in all groups at 3 months
after the surgery. Statistics of NF200-positive percentage indicated
a significant difference between HSSN-L and autograft groups (P < 0.05), whereas the percentages of positive NF200
staining in both HSSN-M and HSSN-H groups were not significantly different
from the autograft group (P > 0.05). Meanwhile,
the
average percentages of positive NF200 staining in HSSN-M and HSSN-H
groups were higher than those in the HSSN-L group, whereas there was
no significant difference between HSSN-M and HSSN-H groups.

Similar results were observed for S100 staining. The percentages
of positive S100 staining in HSSN-L and HSSN-M groups were significantly
lower than those in the autograft group (P < 0.05).
But the percentage of positive S100 staining in the HSSN-H group was
slightly lower than that in the autograft group (P > 0.05).

Toluidine Blue Staining and Electron Microscopy
Toluidine
blue staining assay was performed to visualize myelin sheaths of the
regenerated nerves. As shown in Figure 5A, cross section of the middle portion of the transplanted
section in each group showed regenerated myelinated nerve fibers with
different sizes and densities in each group. Three months after the
surgery, the densities of myelinated nerve fibers in autograft, HSSN-L,
HSSN-M, and HSSN-H groups were 15 250.53, 13 160.18,
11 865.31, and 13 384.94 per mm2, respectively
(Figure 5B). Although
the HSSN-M group showed lower average density of myelinated nerve
fibers than that in HSSN-L and HSSN-M groups, the difference in the
total densities of myelinated nerve fibers among the HSSN groups was
not statistically significant (P > 0.05), indicating
that all HSSNs could mediate nerve regrowth.

the middle portion (A) and statistical analysis of myelinated nerve
fiber density (B). (n = 10; * P <
0.05, compared with autograft group).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the cross
section
of the middle portion of the regenerated nerves are shown in Figure 6A. Three months after
the surgery, the histomorphometric parameters of the regenerated nerves
including axon diameter, myelin sheath thickness, G-ratio, and the number of myelin sheath layers were investigated
(Figure 6B). It was
observed that the regenerated axons were surrounded by clear, thick,
electron-dense myelin sheaths and a perfect basal membrane of Schwann
cells in all groups. The myelin sheaths were characterized by abundant
concentric circle structure layer by layer. A few myelinated fibers
gathered into minifascicles, which were surrounded by a new perineurium.
Similar to the autograft group, the structures of myelinated fibers
of the regenerated tissues in the HSSN groups were compact. However,
the regularly rounded myelinated fibers were seldom observed in HSSN-L
and HSSN-M groups compared to those in HSSN-H and autograft groups.
These results indicated that the group bridged with HSSN-H showed
better morphology and function recovery of myelinated fibers, which
was also demonstrated by the statistical data of the histomorphometric
parameters of the regenerative nerves. The results revealed that the
regenerative nerve tissues bridged with HSSN-H and HSSN-M showed larger
axon diameter, lower G-ratio, and greater myelination
thickness. In general, the ratio value measured in healthy nerves
was around 0.7.27 As a result, the G-ratio value of the HSSN-H group (0.77) in our work was
very close to the normal G-ratio value of healthy
nerves, indicating better axon regeneration than that in HSSN-L and
HSSN-M groups. Furthermore, the regenerative nerve tissues bridged
with HSSN-H also showed more number of myelin sheath layers. On the
whole, the repair efficiency of the peripheral nerve in HSSN-H and
HSSN-M groups might be better than that in HSSN-L, namely, the conduits
with a higher ISA/V may have a better repair efficiency of the peripheral
nerve.

Histological Assessment of Gastrocnemius Muscles
Three
months after the surgery, the morphology of the rat gastrocnemius
muscle was demonstrated by Masson trichrome staining and TEM analysis
(Figure 7A). Muscles
that have lost innervation usually suffer from atrophy, and the atrophy
can be relieved accompanied with a gradual functional recovery of
the sciatic nerves. As shown in Figure 7A, the muscle fibers were stained in red, whereas the
collagen fibers were stained in blue. Similar to the autograft group,
the HSSN-H group had wider muscle fibers which were parallel with
each other (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B,C, when the ISA/V increased, the cross-sectional areas of the muscle
fibers increased, whereas the mean percentage of collagen fiber areas
decreased. As a result, the sponge conduit with a larger ISA/V was
easier to mitigate muscle atrophy than that with a smaller ISA/V in
this case.

Degradation Analysis
The in vivo
biodegradability of
these sponge conduits was characterized by HE staining before and
after implantation. As shown in Figure 8, three types of sponge conduits were dyed in red and
the outer wall of HSSNs and the cavity of channels were apparently
visible before implantation. For the original conduits (at 0 day),
the integrated inner and outer walls of HSSNs could be clearly observed.
The walls contain large amount of pores, which formed a spongelike
structure of HSSNs. At 90 days after implantation, HSSNs severely
deformed and the pores disappeared. The channel cavity of HSSNs was
filled by the regenerative nerve tissue. Although the sponge matrix
could still be observed, it was significantly decreased. In addition,
at 90 days after implantation, the channel boundaries and the morphology
of HSSN-L and HSSN-M were not distinguished clearly, whereas the thickness
of the inner walls among channels and outer walls of HSSN-H decreased
dramatically. These results revealed severe degradation of HSSNs.

Discussion
In our previous work,
a biodegradable and biocompatible HEC/SPI
composite film has been reported.25 Whether
HEC/SPI composite materials could be used in nerve tissue engineering
was investigated in this work. The reasons that we constructed MCNGCs
from sponge were that the sponge structure could not only protect
passages from radial compression, which prevents from collapse or
blocking, but also provide better nutritional support and improve
regeneration because of its high permeability.28−30 Moreover, porous
networks allow the transfer of growth factors and other soluble signaling
molecules among cells in regenerating nerves.14 Several studies have tried to model the architecture of NGCs, offering
important guidelines about the diameter and inner surface area of
the channel inside NGCs.10,20,23,31 However, other geometrical key
parameters are still missing, such as the ISA/V of the channel inside
NGCs. The ISA/V is a comprehensive factor combining the diameter and
cross-sectional area of the channels with the inner surface area of
the channels inside the MCNGCs. Herein, we developed MCNGCs with different
ISA/V based on HEC/SPI composite sponges using our handmade molds
and then further investigated the effect of the ISA/V of the channel
inside the MCNGCs on peripheral nerve regeneration.

CMAP test
can offer an important index for studying the conducting
function of the peripheral nerve. Regenerated nerve fibers must bridge
the nerve gap and innervate the distal target muscle to produce a
CMAP.32 Because the amplitude of the CMAP
positively correlated with the number of nerve fibers innervating
the muscles, the diameter of axons, and the thickness of myelin sheath.31,33 Therefore, the CMAP amplitude and the average CMAP amplitude ratio
in a regenerated nerve are expected to be lower than that of a normal
nerve. In this case, we observed CMAP in all groups, while the CMAP
amplitude in the autograft group was the highest, indicating that
the regenerated nerve function in conduit groups was partly recovered.
In addition, the average CMAP amplitude ratio in HSSN-M and HSSN-H
groups with a larger ISA/V was higher than those in the HSSN-L group
at 3 months after the surgery. These results indicated that the recovery
of electrophysiological properties in HSSN-M and HSSN-H groups approached
the autograft group prior to the HSSN-L group.

Histological
analysis of myelinated axons, such as HE-staining
and NF200/S100 immunofluorescence, further demonstrated the histological
recovery in nerves bridged with HSSNs. HE staining images clearly
confirmed that larger ISA/V of channels could strongly guide nerve
regeneration. The NF200/S100 immunofluorescence images also demonstrated
that the conduits with larger ISA/V have higher positive NF200 and
S100 staining. These results were mainly attributed to the following
reasons:14,34 (1) larger ISA/V supplies adequate space
for cell adhesion and promotes more nerve fibers to grow along with
the rectilinear direction inside the channels; (2) larger ISA/V provides
a conduit for diffusion of neurotrophic factors secreted by the damaged
nerve stump; (3) larger ISA/V provides more support for the adherence
of physiologically relevant Schwann cells and directional expansion
of growing axons; and (4) HSSNs with a greater ISA/V possess a large
network of interconnected pores that is conducive to transfer nutrients
among the channels inside the HSSNs. Therefore, HSSN-M and HSSN-H
can better support regeneration across the gaps by stabilizing the
fibrin matrix and better guide regenerating axons.35

Myelin sheath could not only support axons and adjacent
tissues
and avoid interference among axons but also guide axonal regeneration.
Smaller diameter of the channel impeded connective tissue from occupying
the internal space of channels. As a result, HSSNs with a larger ISA/V
provided a greater and well internal environment for the regeneration,
migration, and myelination of axons. As shown in toluidine blue staining
and TEM analysis, the regenerative nerve tissues bridged with HSSN-H
and HSSN-M showed larger axon diameter, lower G-ratio,
and greater myelination thickness. Furthermore, the regenerative nerve
tissues bridged with HSSN-H also showed higher density of regenerated
myelinated nerve fibers and more number of myelin sheath layers. Meanwhile,
more immature nerve fibers were observed in the HSSN-L group with
smaller axon diameter and myelination thickness and less myelin sheath
layers. The results of the CMAP test and histological evaluation revealed
better microguide function of HSSN-M and HSSN-H with larger ISA/Vs.

As one of the most important nerves of animals, the sciatic nerve
dominates all muscles of legs and feet. The natural nerve can bring
normal sensory and motor functions, whereas the defected nerve leads
to atrophy of the muscle fibers and hyperplasia in the connective
tissues. As a result of motor nerve injury, denervation of a target
muscle occurs, followed by alterations in a series of molecular events.
This induces a shift in the protein metabolism from protein synthesis
toward protein degradation and the decreased size of muscle fibers.15 When reinnervation is achieved, the targeted
muscle atrophy is stopped accompanied by a gradual functional recovery.18,36,37 In this study, HSSN-M and HSSN-H
better mimic the channel-like complex architecture of native nerve
tissues, exhibiting stronger microguide function and better nerve
repair function owing to greater ISA/Vs than those of HSSN-L, hence
better support the recovery of gastrocnemius muscle, such as the increased
cross-sectional areas of muscle fibers, the decreased percentage of
collagen fiber areas, and parallel muscle fibers of motor endplates.

Degradation capacity of biomaterials is an essential information
required for tissue engineering NGC products.38 In this case, we controlled the biodegradability of HSSNs by adjusting
the epoxy chloropropane (ECH) content to match the rate of nerve regeneration
as much as possible. As to the growth of the regenerative nerve, the
higher degree of degradation resulted in thinner walls and produced
larger lumen space for further growth. As a result, the larger lumen
space provided a more advantageous microenvironment during the process
of regeneration and promoted functional and histological recovery
in the rat sciatic nerve defect. The mechanism may be attributed to
its higher biomimetic effect. The biomimetic effect reduced the migration
distance of the regenerating nerve and shortened the migration time
of the regenerating nerve between proximal and distal stumps without
decreasing the quantitative results of regeneration.

To date,
the most effective way to repair large nerve defects still
is autologous nerve grafting, which is regarded as the gold standard
for peripheral nerve repair. Native nerve tissue consists of vast
myelinated nerve fibers, which plays an important role in the peripheral
nerve system. The nerve fibers could not only transmit electrical
signals to adjust the metabolism of the nerve system but also release
nutrition to promote the axonal growth and muscle operation. First,
it is difficult to mimic the unique microstructure (channel-like architecture)
of native nerve tissues. Second, unlike native nerve tissues, HSSNs
lacked various matrix proteins, such as collagen and elastin. Third,
the lack of integrated delivery systems for growth factors or facilitating
cells (Schwann cells or stem cells) limited the nerve repair function.18,27,39 Although HSSN-M and HSSN-H groups
showed favorable repair function, the autograft group in our study
still gave the best quantitative results of regeneration. Hence, we
will further optimize the conditions with the addition of growth factors
and seed cells in the future.

Conclusions
Three kinds of degradable
NGCs with low, medium, and high ISA/Vs
were fabricated from HEC/SPI-based sponges. The effect of the ISA/V
on nerve regeneration was investigated. The overall results suggested
that higher ISA/V was favorable to peripheral nerve regeneration.
Thus, HSSN-M and HSSN-H with higher ISA/Vs may be potential alternatives
in the repair of peripheral nerve defects. The conclusion provided
a probable guiding principle for the structural design of MCNGCs in
future.

Experimental Section
Materials
HEC was obtained from
Shandong Head Co.,
Ltd. (Zibo, China). Commercial SPI was purchased from DuPont Zhengzhou
Protein Technology Co. Ltd. (Zhengzhou, China). SPI was vacuum-dried
for 24 h at 60 °C before use. Sodium hydroxide, ECH, and acetic
acid were of analytical grade (Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd,
Shanghai, China).

Preparation of HEC/SPI Solution
HEC/SPI solution was
prepared according to our previous method.25 Briefly, a 2% HEC aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving HEC
in deionized water. A 10% SPI aqueous solution was obtained by dispersing
10 g of SPI powders into 60 g of water, and then 30 g of NaOH aqueous
solution (5%) were added to dissolve SPI. Then, HEC and SPI solutions
were mixed mechanically to get HEC/SPI blend solution. Then, ECH (20%
of the weight based on the total weight of the original SPI and HEC
powders) was added dropwise in the blend solutions at room temperature
under stirring for 30 min, which were further degassed at 10 °C
by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000 rpm.

Fabrication of HEC/SPI
Sponge-Based MCNGCs
A handmade
mold was used to fabricate the HEC/SPI sponge-based MCNGCs.40 First, 1, 3, and 7 stainless steel wires with
diameters of 1.5, 0.8, and 0.5 mm, respectively, were evenly inserted
into the handmade mold, and then the HEC/SPI solution was injected
into the mold. The mold-containing HEC/SPI solution was frozen at
−20 °C for 24 h and then was put into a precooled freeze
dryer (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MI, USA) to be freeze-dried for
24 h.41 These freeze-dried sponges were
removed from the molds and soaked into 5% acetic acid solution to
neutralize NaOH and then rinsed with distilled water for 4 h. The
sponges were freeze-dried again to obtain a series of HEC/SPI sponge-based
NGCs with 12 mm length and coded as HSSN-L, HSSN-M, and HSSN-H, where
L, M, and H mean low, medium, and high, respectively, corresponding
to the surface area-to-volume ratio of channels in the conduits. For
example, HSSN-L means the HEC/SPI sponge-based NGC with a low ISA/V
in the channel. Figure 9 shows different views of HSSN-M and the schematic demonstration
of ISA/V. Table 1 shows
the conduits samples with various numbers, diameters, cross-sectional
areas, volumes, inner surface areas, and surface area to volume ratios
of channels in HSSNs.

(B) of the HSSN-M. The schematic demonstration of the inner surface
area (C-E) and the volume (F) of the single channel inside HSSN-M.
To measure the inner surface area and the volume of the channels inside
MCNGCs, a single channel was as an example to calculate the inner
surface area and the volume. The diameter and length of a single channel
inside MCNGCs were marked and noted by mouse clicks. Using a 2D image
of unfolded inner surface of the channel to calculate the area according
to the equation: Area = πd × L. Afterwards, using a 3D image of the channel to calculate the volume
according to the equation: Volume = π(d/2)2× L.

Morphological Observation of HSSNs
To prepare samples
for the observation of SEM, dried HSSN-L, HSSN-M, and HSSN-H were
mounted on metal tabs using a carbon adhesive tape and then coated
with gold. The whole appearance and cross sections were observed by
SEM (VEGA 3 LMU, TESCAN, Czech Republic) at an accelerating voltage
of 20 kV. Then, the pore size was measured according to SEM images.
Briefly, 10 SEM images in each group were selected for pore size measurement.
Three regions were randomly captured from every SEM image at 100×
magnification and then analyzed with Image-Pro Plus software to measure
the pore sizes of nerve conduits. First, we measured and recorded
the maximum and minimum distances between any two sites along with
the margin of a pore. Then, the average distance was calculated through
averaging the maximum and minimum distances. The pore size was presented
as the average distance.

Animal Experiments and Surgical Procedures
for the Repair of
Nerve Defects
The experiment was performed in compliance
with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines such as Ministry
of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China
“Guiding Opinions on the Treatment of Animals (09/30/2006)”.
All procedures concerning animals were approved by and conformed to
the guidelines of the Animal Care & Welfare Committee of Wuhan
University School of Medicine. Forty female adult Sprague Dawley rats,
weighing approximately 200–220 g, were randomly divided into
four groups (HSSN-L, HSSN-M, HSSN-H, and autograft groups) with 10
animals in each group. The surgery protocol was as follows: rats were
anesthetized using 7% chloral hydrate solution (350 mg/kg body weight)
by an intraperitoneal injection. The right sciatic nerve was exposed
through an upper lateral thigh incision. A sciatic nerve segment was
removed to create a 10 mm gap. The proximal and distal nerve ends
were then inserted 1 mm into the 12 mm long conduits and were secured
with 8-0 monofilament nylon sutures. For multichannel nerve conduits,
before surgery, the spongelike channel walls within the multichannel
nerve conduits at both ends of the multichannel conduits were removed
using normal surgical tweezers. This could provide enough spaces for
the accommodation of distal stump and proximal stump. After that,
the proximal stump and distal stump of the transected peripheral nerve
were placed at both ends of the conduit. The nerve stumps and conduit
were then sutured together using 8-0 monofilament nylon sutures. For
the autograft, the removed nerve segment was reversed 180° and
reattached using 4-0 nylon sutures. The animals were returned to the
cages where they had free access to food and water during a recovery
period of 3 months.42

Electrophysiological
Assessments
Three months after
the surgery, the sciatic nerve on the operated side was re-exposed.
Electrical stimulation was applied to the proximal nerve trunk, and
the CMAP for the gastrocnemius belly on the operated side was recorded.
Normal CMAPs were measured on the unoperated side.18,32

Histological Assessment of Regenerated Nerves
HE Staining Analysis
After conventional feeding for
3 months, the animals were deeply anesthetized after electrophysiological
assessment. The regenerated nerve specimens were harvested, washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
Then, the tissues were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Longitudinal
5 μm sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (HE). The
sections were observed using a light microscope (BX51, OLYMPUS, Japan).

Double NF200/S100 Immunofluorescence Analysis
For double
immunofluorescence analysis of NF200 and S100, HSSNs and the regenerated
nerves were dissected, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde at 4 °C
for 6 h and then immersed for 3 days in 30 w/v % sucrose at 4 °C.
Then, they were embedded with an optimal cutting temperature compound
(Sakura, Tokyo, Japan) and frozen at −20 °C. Longitudinal
sections with 10 μm thickness were prepared with a freezing
microtome (CM1950, Leica, Germany). The sections were incubated with
1% normal goat serum in PBS (1 h, room temperature) and then with
a mixture of primary antibodies, antiNF200 (1:500; ab24574; Abcam
Inc., UK) and antiS100 (1:500; S2644, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Afterward,
the sections were rinsed in PBS and then incubated with a mixture
of secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antimouse
IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:500, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Finally, the stained sections were rinsed and then viewed under a
fluorescent microscope (BX51, OLYMPUS, Japan). Three images were captured
randomly with an OLYMPUS DP71 digital camera at 200× magnification.
These images were analyzed with Image-Pro Plus software to measure
the positive NF200 and S100 staining area of the regenerated nerves.
The original fluorescence image was inverted as a contrast, and then
by discarding all color information, it was transformed into a gray-scale
image. Afterward, the image was manually segmented according to the
defined intensity range. The regions in the defined intensity range
were selected. The selected regions were positive NF200 staining or
positive S100 staining regions. Then, the total area of the selected
regions and the total area of the image were measured with Image-Pro
Plus software. Finally, the percentages of positive NF200 staining
and positive S100 staining were calculated through dividing the positive
area by the total area of the image.

Toluidine Blue Staining
and TEM
After electrophysiological
examination, the regenerated nerves or autografts were quickly harvested
and fixed in cold buffered 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 6 h. Then,
the regenerated nerves were washed with PBS, and sections were taken
from the middle regions of the regenerated sciatic nerve. The samples
were postfixed with 1% osmium tetraoxide solution, dehydrated, and
embedded in an Epon 812 epoxy resin. Transverse semithin sections
with a thickness of 1 μm were stained with toluidine blue and
then observed under a light microscope (BX71, OLYMPUS, Japan). To
quantify the density of myelinated nerve fibers, three images were
randomly captured at 400× magnification for each nerve specimen
and all these images were counted at 100× magnification to obtain
the numbers of myelinated nerve fibers. Then, the number of myelinated
nerve fibers per unit area was calculated for each image. The numbers
of myelinated nerve fibers per unit area for three images were averaged
to get the mean number of myelinated nerve fibers per unit area for
each regenerated nerve. Then, the total number of myelinated nerve
fibers for each regenerated nerve was calculated through multiplying
the mean number of myelinated nerve fibers per unit area by the total
area of myelinated nerve fibers. Transverse ultrathin 50 nm sections
were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and then examined
under a transmission electron microscope (HT7700, Hitachi, Japan).
Similarly, Image-Pro Plus software was used to measure axon diameter,
myelinated nerve fiber diameter, myelin sheath thickness, and the
number of myelin sheath layer from the TEM images. For each specimen,
four images were randomly captured at 700× magnification and
60 axons of each were randomly analyzed. The G-ratio
was calculated according to the following formula.43 1  where Do means
the diameter of the corresponding fiber (outer) and Di means the axon diameter (inner).

Histological
Assessment of Gastrocnemius Muscles
Three
months after the surgery, the gastrocnemius muscles of operated hind
limbs were harvested and cut into halves. Half of the samples were
fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer at
4 °C for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Transverse 5 μm
sections were prepared and subjected to Masson’s trichrome
staining and then observed under a light microscope (BX71, OLYMPUS,
Japan). The other half of the samples were fixed in a buffered 2.5%
glutaraldehyde solution, postfixed with 1% osmium tetraoxide solution,
dehydrated, and embedded in an Epon 812 epoxy resin. Longitudinal
ultrathin 50 nm sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl
acetate and examined under a transmission electron microscope (HT7700,
Hitachi, Japan). To quantify the cross-sectional area of the muscle
fibers and the percentage of the collagen fiber, three images were
randomly captured at 200× magnification from each Masson’s
trichrome staining section and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus software.
The cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers, the muscle fiber area
(a), and the collagen fiber area (b) were measured from each image.
The percentage of the collagen fiber (c) was calculated according
to following formula.15 2  

Degradation of HSSNs
Three months after the surgery,
HSSN-L, HSSN-M, and HSSN-H containing regenerated nerves were harvested,
washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Then,
the samples were dehydrated using graded ethanol and embedded in paraffin.
Transverse 5 μm sections were stained with HE. The sections
were observed and photographed using a light microscope (BX71, OLYMPUS,
Japan).

Statistical Analysis
All of the quantitative data were
expressed as means ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons
were performed using one-way analysis of variance with Origin 8.0
software (OriginLab Co., Hampton, USA). P values
of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
