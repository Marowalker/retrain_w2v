A cyclometalated Ir(III) complex,
[Ir(ppy)2(LH)] (2) [LH2 = 1,2-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)benzene;
ppyH = 2-phenylpyridine] was synthesized and structurally characterized.
[Ir(ppy)2(LH)] contains free donor sites and functions
as a metalloligand. Accordingly, it interacts with a Cu(II) salt to
afford the heterometallic tetranuclear complex, [{Ir(ppy)2(L)}2{Cu2Cl2}] (3).
In the latter, a Cu2Cl2 dimer bridges the two
cyclometalated Ir(III) units, resulting in a IrIII–CuII–CuII–IrIII motif. 2 also functions as a selective and reversible sensor for
Cu2+, as revealed by quenching of its emission and subsequent
revival of the luminescence signal upon addition of EDTA.

Introduction
In recent years, the
research on the design of polynuclear transition
metal complexes has been on the forefront owing to their intriguing
structural organization which offers scope for diverse applications.1−5 The synthesis of such complexes can be accomplished by several ways.
One of these is by the use of multifunctional ligands and relies on
the so-called serendipity-based approach.6,7 Although
the latter methodology has been tremendously successful, its drawback
is that the nature and structure of the product cannot be designed
a priori. On the other hand, preformed transition metal complexes
that themselves have coordination functionalities can be utilized
to obtain polynuclear assemblies based on a complex-as-ligand approach.8−11 Previously, research from our group has focused on the synthesis,
structural characterization, and photophysical studies of cyclometalated
Ir(III) complexes,12−14 where by utilizing various types of ancillary ligands
we successfully achieved the assembly of mono-, di- and tri-nuclear
Ir(III) complexes. Our group has also been involved in the assembly
of heterometallic 3d/4f complexes that possess interesting magnetic
properties.15−19 In this connection, we envisioned the possibility of synthesizing
heterometallic complexes that contain cyclometalated Ir(III) motifs.
There have been literature precedents for this idea.20−27 For example, Collin, Flamigni, and co-workers have reported the
synthesis of Ir(III)–Cu(I) pseudo rotaxane; the Cu(I) center
in this complex was found to quench the emission of the Ir(ppy)2 unit.23 De Cola and co-workers
have shown the use of Ir(III) complexes for the assembly of Ir(III)–Ln(II)
complexes.24,25 Lin and co-workers have reported
coordination polymers bearing Ir(ppy)3 motifs. The porous
coordination polymers so obtained could sense dioxygen by luminescence
quenching.26 In another study, Ir(III)–Pt(II)-based
phosphorescent oligometallaynes were designed utilizing iridium(III)
metalloligands possessing bifunctional pendant acetylene groups.27 Keeping these developments in mind, we have
designed a cyclometalated Ir(III) metalloligand, Ir(ppy)2(LH) (2) [LH2 = 1,2-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)benzene;
ppyH = 2-phenylpyridine] and assembled a novel tetranuclear heterometallic
complex, [{Ir(ppy)2(L)}2{Cu2Cl2}] (3) containing a Ir(III)–Cu(II)–Cu(II)–Ir(III)
sequence. We also demonstrate the utility of 2 as a selective
turn-off sensor for Cu2+. These results are discussed here
in.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic and Structural Aspects
The heteroleptic Ir(III)
complex, Ir(ppy)2(LH) (2), was obtained in
the form of a yellow solid following a sequential two-step synthesis
protocol (Scheme 1).
In the first step, cyclometalated chloro-bridged iridium(III) dimer,
[(ppy)2Ir(μ-Cl)]2 (1), was
synthesized following the Nonoyama protocol.28 Subsequently, on reaction of this chloro-bridged iridium(III) dimer
with sodium methoxide followed by reaction with the ancillary ligand
1,2-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)benzene (LH2) afforded the heteroleptic complex, Ir(ppy)2(LH) (2) (Scheme 1). The molecular constitution of 2 was confirmed
by X-ray crystal structure (Figure 1 and Table 1), which reveals that even though the ancillary ligand 1,2-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)
benzene contains two chelating, N,N sites, as anticipated, because
of steric congestion, only one of them binds to the Ir(III) center,
resulting from a de-protonation of one of the amide sites. Thus, 2 is a neutral and mononuclear cyclometalated Ir(III) complex.
Consequently, 2 is a potential metalloligand containing
a free chelating binding site. As shown in Figure 1, the iridium center in 2 is
coordinated to three chelating ligands, two cyclometalating phenylpyridine
ligands (C^N), and only one arm of the ancillary picolinamide ligand
through the deprotonated amide N and a pyridine N atom (N^N), leaving
the carbonyl oxygen uncoordinated. The coordination geometry and the
metric parameters of 2 are trivial and are similar to
those observed in other cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes in general
and those containing amide ligands in particular (Table 2).29−33

To ascertain if 2 can function as a metalloligand,
we chose to react it with copper(II)acetate monohydrate affording
the heterometallic tetranuclear complex, {Ir(ppy)2(L)}2{Cu2Cl2}] (3) (Scheme 1). The coordination
environment and geometry of the Ir(III) centers in 3 is
unaffected as a result of binding to Cu(II) (distorted octahedral
geometry; 2C, 4N coordination environment; nitrogen atoms of the phenylpyridine
ligand in a trans orientation; and the carbon atoms in the cis orientation).
Also, the bond parameters, around Ir(III), are not affected upon binding
to Cu(II) (Table 3).
The two Ir(III) centers in 3 are connected by a Cu2Cl2 dimer. Each Cu(II) is bound to the metalloligand
through a N, N, O coordination involving the carboxamide arm. As a
result, each Cu(II) is part of three ring systems which vary in size
(7, 5, and 4, Figure 1). The Cu(II) centers are in a distorted square pyramidal geometry
[τ (index of trigonality) = 0.41; for a perfect square pyramid,
τ = 0 and for a perfect trigonal bipyramid, τ = 1).34 Each Cu(II) contains a 2N, 2Cl, O coordination
environment where the square plane is formed by two nitrogen atoms
[N(5), N(6)] and one oxygen atom [O(1)] of the carboxamide ligand
along with a chloride ion. The apical site is occupied by another
chloride ion. The apical Cu–Cl distance is longer, which is
2.582(2) Å in comparison to the basal Cu–Cl distance,
2.314 (2) Å (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The Cu(II) lies above the mean basal plane by ∼0.3 Å.
The Cu2Cl2 bridging unit is nearly a square
with the two Cu–Cl distances being 2.314 and 2.582 Å,
whereas the Cu–Cl–Cu′ and the Cl–Cu–Cl′
bond angles are 91.6° and 88.4° respectively. Interestingly,
apart from one example, in many Cu2Cl2 dimers,
the bond angles deviate from 90.0°.35 The nonbonding Cu···Cu distance in 3 is 3.514 Å. The overall molecular structure of 3 has a crystallographic center of inversion which is located between
the two central copper(II) ions. Finally, the Ir(III) and Cu(II) atoms
are coplanar; the Ir(1)–Cu(1)–Cu(1′)–Ir(1′)
dihedral angle is 180°.

Photophysical
Properties
The neutral mononuclear complex,
Ir(ppy)2(LH) (2), exhibits an intense absorption
at around 250–300 nm (ε > 104 M–1 cm–1) in the ultraviolet region which is attributed
to the π–π* transitions associated with the coordinated
ligands (Figure 2 and Table 4). The low-energy
bands in the wavelength ranging from 350 to 400 nm (ε ≈
6000–5000 M–1 cm–1) extending
up to the visible region could be assigned to spin-allowed 1MLCT, 1LLCT, and 1ILCT (charge transfer) transitions.
On the other hand, the spin-forbidden transitions (3MLCT, 3LLCT, and 3ILCT) are associated with the low extinction
coefficient (ε ≈ 400 M–1 cm–1), as expected for this family of complexes, which could be located
at around 448 nm. Strong spin–orbit coupling effects associated
with the Ir(III) metal center facilitate the spin-forbidden transitions.
On the basis of the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
calculations performed on 2 considering the ground-state
geometry-optimized parameters (Tables S1–S3: Supporting Information), we have assigned the bands (Tables
S1–S3: Supporting Information).
These absorption features are similar in nature as observed in previous
literature reports.29−33

The formation of the heterometallic complex 3, whose
molecular structure has been described above, prompted us to examine
the changes in the optical spectra of 2 upon the addition
of increased concentrations of various metal ions (Figure 2). Except for Cu2+, Pb2+, and Hg2+ other metal ions (Ca2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) exerted very little influence on the absorption features (Figure S2). Upon the addition of increasing amounts
of Cu2+ to an acetonitrile solution of 2,
a gradual decrease in the molar absorptivity of the broad band at
∼370 nm with a concomitant increase in the higher energy absorption
band was observed (Figure 2). A well-defined isobestic point could be located at 327
nm, indicating strong ground state interactions between 2 and Cu2+. The stoichiometry of the complex was determined
by Job’s method by maintaining the sum of the initial concentration
of Cu2+ and 2 constant at 20 μM and
the mole fraction of Cu2+ ion varied from 0 to 1. The absorbance
of 2 at 312 nm in the absence (A0) and presence (A) of Cu2+ was
determined. A plot of (A – A0)/A0 vs the mole fraction
of Cu2+ showed an inflection point at 0.5, indicating a
1:1 stoichiometry of the Cu2+: 2 in the complex
(Figure S3). As already noted above, the
complex formation with a molar ratio of 1:1 has been established by
the single X-ray crystal structure of 3.

Addition
of Hg2+ and Pb2+ to 2 at high concentrations
(100 μM) also results in an increase
of the molar absorptivity of the high-energy bands of 2 and a decrease in absorptivity of the low-energy bands (Figure S4, Supporting Information). However, in contrast
to the situation with Cu2+, isosbestic points could not
be located for the interaction of Hg2+ and Pb2+ with 2 (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

The emission spectrum of 2 is characterized
by a single
structure-less band at ∼ 520 nm upon excitation at 360 nm (Figure 3). The influence
of the addition of various metal ions upon the emission spectrum of 2 is shown in Figure 3a, which clearly reveals that while Cu2+ completely
quenches the emission intensity, the other ions do not have any effect.
A study on the effect of concentration of Cu2+ on the emission
intensity of 2 revealed that at 20 μM concentration
(vis-à-vis 10 μM of 2) complete quenching
of emission intensity was observed (Figure 3b). Thus, 2 can be considered
as a turn-off sensor for Cu2+ with a detection limit of
1 ppm. The quenching of emission intensity affected by the addition
of Cu2+ is not affected in the presence of other metal
ions, such as Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, and
Zn2+ (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the quenching of emission intensity of 2 by Cu2+ can be completely reversed by the addition of
an aqueous solution of EDTA to a solution of 2 and Cu2+ in acetonitrile; the emission at 520 nm was completely recovered
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). The
stability constant (Ka) for the binding
of 2 with Cu2+ was calculated to be 4.5 ×
105 L mol–1 from the change of the emission
intensity data at 520 nm as a function of the concentration of Cu2+ ion added using a nonlinear least square fit (Supporting Information, Figure S6).36,37 In an air-equilibrated solution, the quantum yield of 2 (reference, quinine sulfate) was found to be 0.11, which decreases
to 0.01 upon interaction with Cu2+. The emission spectrum
of 3 is presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S7). This quenching of emission by Cu2+ may be due to the paramagnetic nature of Cu2+.38,39

and spectra after addition of 10 equiv of various metal ions in acetonitrile.
(b) Phosphorescence spectra of 2 (10.0 μM) upon
addition of increasing concentrations of Cu2+ at an excitation
wavelength was 360 nm.

Because amides are also well-known receptors for anions,40,41 the absorption and emission titration of 2 with various
common anions was carried out. We were unable to detect any major
changes in such titrations except that the molar absorption of 2 (∼250 nm) increases slightly upon binding with iodide
ions (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information).

DFT and TDDFT Studies of 2
Computational
calculations (density functional theory (DFT)) on 2 shed
light on its electronic structure and supplement in the understanding
of its optical response. Isosurface plots of few relevant molecular
orbitals of 2 are presented in Figure S10, while the corresponding orbital compositions are given
in Table S1. From our results, we clearly
see that some of the orbitals viz. highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO), HOMO-1, and HOMO-2 are primarily centered on the Ir atom (21–40%);
varying percentages are present on both the cyclometalating and the
ancillary ligand. On the contrary, orbitals such as lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO), LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 are all composed of ligand
orbitals with appreciably small contributions of Ir orbitals (<4%).
These results are in good agreement with what has been reported for
this family of complexes.29,32 The results of the
TDDFT calculations using PBE0 functional and LANL2DZ/6-31G(d) basis
sets with polarizable continuum model (PCM), taking into account the
solvation effects, are given in Tables S2–S3 (Supporting Information). On the basis of these calculations,
the lowest energy absorptions (singlet and triplet) can be assigned
to possess mixed metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), ligand to
ligand charge transfer (LLCT), and intraligand charge transfer (ILCT)
characteristics. A comparison of the experimental and DFT simulated
spectra by considering only the singlet transitions is displayed with
the help of vertical bars in Figure S11.

Conclusions
In summary, we report here the synthesis
and structural characterization
of a Ir(III)–Cu(II)-based tetranuclear complex (3) using a cyclometalated Ir(III) complex (2) as a metallo
ligand. To the best of our knowledge, 3 represents the
first example of a structurally characterized heterobimetallic Ir(III)–Cu(II)
complex. The cyclometalated Ir(III) complex, 2, functions
as a selective Cu2+ sensor with a detection limit of 1
ppm. Our results provide further insights into the expanding field
of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes other than their well-explored
role as phosphorescent emitters.

Experimental Section
General
We procured iridium chloride from Arora Matthey,
Kolkata, India. 2-Phenyl pyridine, o-phenylenediamine,
and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O were obtained
from the Aldrich Chemical Company, USA, and used as it is without
any further purification. Perchlorate salts, namely, Pb(ClO4)2·6H2O, Hg(ClO4)2·6H2O, Ca(ClO4)2·6H2O, Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O, Cd(ClO4)2·6H2O, Ni(ClO4)2·6H2O, and Mg(ClO4)2·6H2O, were made from their carbonate salts on reaction
with perchloric acid. All other useful chemicals were obtained from
S. D. Fine-Chemicals, Mumbai, India. Solvents used in the reactions
were freshly distilled according to the standard procedures under
inert atmosphere.42 Freshly prepared sodium
methoxide was used for the reaction.

The chloro-bridged precursor
[(ppy)2Ir(μ-Cl)]2 (1) was
synthesized following the literature report employing the Nonoyama
protocol,28 by the reaction of IrCl3·nH2O with 2.5 equiv of the
cyclometalating ligand 2-phenyl pyridine in a 3:1 solvent mixture
of 2-ethoxyethanol and water. The ancillary picolinamide ligand 1,2-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)
benzene (LH2) was synthesized
following a reported method.43

Caution: Although we have encountered no complications,
perchlorate salts should be handled with care because they are potentially
explosive.

Instrumentation
With the help of
a Waters Micromass
Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, all ESI-MS analyses
were recorded. Methanol (2) or acetonitrile (3) was used as the solvent, whereas nitrogen gas has been used for
desolvation for the electrospray ionization (positive ion, in full
scan mode). The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-DELTA2
500 model spectrometer by employing CDCl3 as the solvent
and TMS as the reference. The infrared (IR) spectra were recorded
on a Bruker FT-IR Vector 22 model (as KBr pellets in the range 4000–400
cm–1). The ThermoQuest CE instruments CHNS-O, EA/110
model was used for the elemental analyses. A PerkinElmer-LAMBDA 20
UV–visible spectrometer was employed for recording the UV–visible
spectra. A PerkinElmer spectrophotometer (LS-55 model) was used to
record the steady state emission spectra. Quantum yield measurements
were done considering quinine sulfate in 1.0 N sulfuric acid solution
as the reference (Φ = 0.54 ± 0.2 where λexc = 350 nm). The following equation was used for the calculation of
the quantum yield  

In the above expression,
Φ is
the fluorescence quantum yield, where the subscripts S and R represent
the sample and reference, respectively. AR and AS are the solution absorbances
at the excitation wavelength, IR and IS are the integrated emission intensities, and nR and nS are the
refractive indices of the solvent used for measurement.

X-ray Structural
Analysis
A CCD Bruker SMART APEX diffractometer
was used for X-ray diffraction data collection at 100K that uses graphite
monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å). For collecting frames of data, indexing reflections, and
determining lattice parameters, the program SMART44 was used. In addition, other programs that have been used
for our analysis are SAINT (for the integration of the reflection
intensity and scaling), SADABS45 (for the
absorption correction), SHELXTL46,47 (for determining the
space group and structure), SHELXL-2016 (for least-squares refinements
on F2), and Olex2/mask47 (for
treating the disordered solvent molecules in compounds 2 and 3; (Supporting Information, Table S5)). The refinement of all nonhydrogen atoms was done with
anisotropic displacement parameters. All hydrogen atoms were refined
isotropically, and by using a riding model, these were fixed at geometrically
calculated positions. With the aid of the ORTEP program, all molecular
graphics have been generated.

Computational Details
Gaussian 03 was employed for
all computational (DFT) calculations.48 The geometrical parameters of 2 as obtained from the
crystal structure analysis were subjected to further optimization
using the PBE0 density functional.49 In
addition, double zeta LANL2DZ basis sets along with quasirelativistic
pseudopotentials for Ir atoms considering 17 valence electrons were
used.50 For all other atoms, 6-31G(d) basis
sets were chosen. With the optimized geometry from the above DFT procedure
(PBE0/LANL2DZ/6-31G(d) level), subsequent TDDFT calculations were
performed, taking account of the solvation effect by means of the
PCM solvation model51 in acetonitrile solution.
With the help of GaussSum52 software, the
electronic spectrum simulation (with fwhm = 0.4 eV) was done. GaussView
was used for the visualization of the orbitals, and Vmodes53 was used to calculate the percentage contributions
of respective orbitals on the metal and ligands.

Synthesis
Synthesis
of [Ir(ppy)2(LH)] (2)
Freshly prepared
solid sodium methoxide (0.025 g, 0.466 mmol) was
added to a 30 mL dichloromethane solution of [(ppy)2Ir(μ-Cl)]2 (0.10 g, 0.093 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred
for 2 h till the solution changed color from yellow to orange. To
this solution, the ancillary ligand 1,2-bis(pyridine-2-carboxamido)benzene
(LH2) (0.065 g, 0.205 mmol) was
added at once. The reaction mixture was further stirred for 12 h at
room temperature followed by filtration and removal of the solvent
in vacuo to afford a yellow oil. A yellowish solid compound was obtained
upon the addition of diethyl ether (10 mL) followed by trituration.
The solution was filtered to afford the solid compound which was further
washed with cold methanol and dried. Single crystals for X-ray diffraction
were grown by dissolving the dried yellow solid in dichloromethane
and layering with a few drops of methanol. (Yield: 0.112g, 74%).

Synthesis of [{Ir(ppy)2(L)}2{Cu2Cl2}] (3)
Complex 2 (0.05 g, 0.061 mmol) was dissolved
in 10 mL of dichloromethane,
and a methanolic solution of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (0.012 g, 0.061 mmol) was added to this. The reaction mixture
was stirred for 10 min at room temperature, filtered, and kept for
crystallization. Brown crystals of [{Ir(ppy)2(L)}2{Cu2Cl2}] (3) suitable for X-ray
diffraction were obtained by slow evaporation after 3 days. (Yield:
0.034g, 62%)
