We
have synthesized a series of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide/ionic
liquid) with deposited Au nanoparticles. The size of the nanoparticle
range was varied from 10 to 35 nm, and these were characterized by
transmission electron microscopy analysis. Ionic liquids (IL) were
chosen by varying the polymerizable unit to be both in cationic (allyl)
and anionic (acrylate) moiety. One-pot polymerization was done with N-isopropylacrylamide and IL using ammonium persulphate
as the initiator, to which were added already prepared Au NPs. These
thermally sensitive composites formed, possessed reversible swelling/deswelling
abilities in water, and demonstrated a reversible visible phase transition,
which was detected by differential scanning calorimetric measurements.
The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) showed dependency on
the size of nanoparticles and the IL independently. It was seen that
the LCST of PNIPAM-based composite films can be tuned from 32 °C
to a range of 23–67 °C by choosing the desired Au NP size,
its concentration and kind of IL.

Introduction
Extremely productive and versatile classes
of environmentally responsive materials1,2 have been studied
since ages which can change their physical, chemical, or electronic
conformations on stimuli like light, temperature, pH, ions, electric/magnetic
fields, or biological agents. Temperature is one such stimuli present
naturally and artificially, making thermo-responsive polymers a fascinating
category for examination. These tend to show phase transitions like
lower critical solution temperature (LCST)3 where the polymer shows decreased solubility at elevated temperatures.
A simple, intensively effective, and rigorously investigated temperature-sensitive
polymers include poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) or PNIPAM.4 It exhibits a sharp LCST at exactly 31–33
°C in aqueous media, near to physiological body temperature which
makes it of tremendous use in biological applications.5 It undergoes coil-to-globule transition in the presence
of water because of changes in conformation around its hydrophobic
part. As the temperature of the system is increased, hydrophobic interactions
of nonpolar backbone and isopropyl groups becomes dominant,6 causing the polymer structure to collapse in
a globule separated from water. This is visually seen as a turbid
occasion. As PNIPAM’s LCST does not depend on the polymer concentration
or its molecular weight,3,7 tuning of this class
of polymer is done widely by adding different salts or entities,8 by changing the functionalities9 or via co-polymerization.10,11 These tuned
LCST of composites/hybrids gives potential for utilization in drug
deliveries,12 sensors,13,14 catalysis, bio-engineering,15 separation,16 and so forth.

One such method to tune
the LCST of polymers can be the use of green solvents, ionic liquids
(IL) as co-monomers.17,18 Its general properties include
low vapor pressure, high electrical and chemical stability, high conductivity,
and most importantly, their designability on the basis of hydrophilic/hydrophobic
parts, providing tunability.19 Other versatile
properties of these environmentally benign solvents depend on the
class of ILs being utilized. For example, pyrrolidinium-based ILs20 have high energy storage capacity, making them
suitable for heat transfer media, while phosphonium-based ILs21 lack acidic protons and are less dense than
water, which make them apt for separation. Meanwhile, imidazolium-based
ILs22 are the best candidates when polarity
or hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity needs to be tailored for a chosen
application. Kohno and Ohno23 have already
reported the important role of hydrophobicity, making it the key factor
to show LCST/UCST of amino-acid based ILs in aqueous media. Thus,
ILs become an important class of materials based on the phase transitions.
Our group has previously reported the tuning of LCST of PNIPAM by
copolymerizing with imidazolium based ILs. We have observed the tuning
of random co-polymers of PNIPAM/IL which showed clear dependency on
hydrophobicity of cations and nature of anions.

Nowadays, nanoparticle
(NP) chemistry is a hot topic and is currently under intense research.
Gold NPs (Au NPs) display distinctive physiochemical properties24 based on different shape,25 size,26 solubility,27 and pH.28 They show
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and a strong absorption
in UV–vis–NIR range.24 Hence,
they become very effective in the utility of electronics,29 catalysis,30 optics,31 diagnosis,32 biomedicine,33 and sensing.34 It
was already known that citrate-protected NPs are susceptible to easy
aggregation.35 To overcome this problem,
very recently, modification on PNIPAM is under way with the use of
Au NPs.13,36−38 Different methods like
grafting-to and grafting-from have been developed to create PNIPAM
brushes39/shells40/nanocomposite41 coated over Au NPs. Hoongenboom
et al.42 reported the use of PNIPAM-coated
Au NPs in salt and its colorimetric sensing. Yuan et al.43 have used the PNIPAM-modified Au NP for bioactivity
modulation. Many other groups are studying the mechanistic and kinetics
of the variety of growth method, shell responses, and phase transitions
over NPs.44−47 It was also reported by Hu et al.48 that
plasmonic NPs like Au improve the thermal and light sensitivity of
thermo-sensitive polymers because they act as anchors to restrict
the hydrophobic chains of the polymers from rotating at an early stage,
thereby inducing a greater demand of thermal energy to collapse. However,
systematic dependence on the NP size has not been studied yet.

Taking inspiration from the above research perspectives, it seems
quite interesting to incorporate distinct sizes of Au NP in PNIPAM/IL
copolymers and study its effect. It is believable that the polymerized
IL can stabilize the Au NPs and in turn, NPs could enhance the light
to thermal efficiency of the thermos-sensitive polymer. This would
double the opportunity of its use in different applications.49,50 Thus, in our study, hydrophilic citrate-coated Au NPs ranging from
10 to 35 nm in size have been prepared according to the literature.
Further, in the presence of these NPs, copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) with polymerizable N,N′-di-substituted
imidazolium-based ILs was done using ammonium persulphate to form
a polymer film which showed tunable reversible LCST behavior in water.
How the size of NPs and structure of IL affect the LCST and how they
can be further tuned were studied as the key points of understanding.

Results
and Discussion
For the synthesis of Au NPs, different reaction
conditions were employed to create particles in the range 10–35
nm (Figure 1). Many
factors including temperature were varied in the reaction procedure
to obtain the desired diameter of the particles. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) showed that monodispersed NPs were formed with the
polydispersity lying between 1.5 and 7.3%. The in situ copolymerization
of Au@PNIPAM-co-IL was done using ammonium persulphate
as the initiator for the free-radical polymerization. A 10 mol % of
bisacrylamide was added, while the reaction proceeded to ensure the
formation of a 3D polymer network. The synthesis was confirmed by 1H NMR in DMSO-d6 (Figure 2). Matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) measurements showed the molecular
weight of the matrix to be in the order of ∼1050 g/mol. Hence,
a low-molecular weight oligomer framework was synthesized for PNIPAM-co-IL. TEM analysis was also carried out which showed the
Au NPs being distinctively embedded and dispersed into the copolymer
matrix of NIPAM and IL (Figure 3b). The size of the Au NP remained almost the same after the
polymerization, which suggested the absence of aggregation of particles
once incorporated into the matrix. This emphasises the fact that IL-containing
copolymer chains acted as a stabilizing ligand for the particles.51

For the LCST temperature determination, 1 mg of the copolymer was
dissolved in 2 mg water and dissolved solution made above after sonication
was taken and subjected to differential scanning calorimetry at a
rate of 1 °C/min for 15–90 °C. Thus, the effect of
structure of polymerizable ILs and size of Au NPs was studied on the
LCST of this polymer matrix.

Effect of Polymerizable IL on LCST of Au@PNIPAM-co-IL Composites
Under constant size of Au NPs
(sample 1: 10 nm), structures of IL were changed and the results of
LCST measurements were as procured in Table 1. It is seen clearly that the phase transition
temperature depends on the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the IL
as excepted. For example, Au(10 nm)@PNIPAM-co-AMImCl
has the LCST of 41 °C, whereas Au(10 nm)@PNIPAM-co-AOImTFSI has it at 23 °C. AMImCl is the most hydrophilic moiety
among the IL structures we examined, where chloride ions and short
alkyl chains (allyl and methyl) have strong ion-dipole forces to overcome
the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Hence, it takes enough
energy to surpass this condition and for hydrophobicity of the allyl
group to become dominant, thereby delaying the phase transition temperature
from 32 °C of pure PNIPAM to 41 °C. As we increase the hydrophobicity
in the IL moiety by increasing the chain length from hexyl-methyl
to allyl-octyl, the LCST temperature decreased. Thus, Au(10 nm)@PNIPAM-co-HMImAcr has LCST of 39 °C, while Au(10 nm)@PNIPAM-co-AOImBr has 33 °C. As it is already known that TFSI
is a bulky anion water-repellent in nature,52 it became interesting to note that the LCST when using this IL becomes
lower even than the pure PNIPAM. As more of the hydrophobic moieties
are introduced in water,53 because of the
hydrophobic effect, there happens a greater interference with the
hydrogen bonding. Hence, the LCST temperature is lowered. Hence, both
cation and anion play a key role in the phenomenon of phase behavior.

Thus, keeping the size of NPs constant, hydrogen bonding
of the polymer chains water plays a significant role toward LCST.
This suggests that changing the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of
the IL can help in the fine-tuning of the LCST of these copolymers.
Here, just by changing the structure of the IL, the LCST can be customized
from 32 to 23–41 °C. This trend is systematic and was
similarly observed in all the ILs irrespective of any NP size. Not
to forget, different sized NPs will yield different results, which
can be used to further tune the phase behavior of systems and will
be discussed in the subsequent sections. Effect of Au NP size on LCST
of Au@PNIPAM-co-IL composites was studied.

In this research work, the diameters of the spherical NPs were varied
from 10 to 32 nm in 6 different sizes (Table 2). The normalized DSC profiles showed distinguished
endotherms because of the LCST temperature (Figure 4). The LCST temperatures are listed in Table 2. It is observed that
LCST increased as the size of the NPs increased irrespective of the
IL structure. This can be clearly perceived upon discussing each case
particularly. Starting with the results for Au@PNIPAM-co-AMImCl, with the enlarged sized induction of NPs from 10 to 17 nm
in the matrix, LCST increased from 41 to 47 °C. With increasing
NP size subsequently to 32 nm, the attained maximum LCST was at 67
°C. This reason can be well deciphered if we understand the mechanism
at the sub-atomic level. Because the NPs are well distributed in the
matrix, Au NPs can act like anchors and control the movement of the
polymer chains. They reduce the rotation of polymer chains and IL
moieties to restrict the formation of the hydrophobic globule.53 This delays the molecular conformational change
of polymers and thus, a greater amount of energy is required to overcome
this restriction, which foster as an increase in the LCST temperature.
As we keep the concentration of the NPs constant, it can also be presumed
that as the size of the NP is increased, the limitation of the bond
rotations increases.

When the IL is changed to hydrophilic one, that is,
HMImAcr, for the copolymers Au@PNIPAM-co-HMImAcr,
the lowest LCST of 39 °C was achieved when the spherical diameter
was smallest and it further increased to 64 °C as the size of
NPs increased. The trend is the same as observed for Au@PNIPAM-co-AMImCl. However, the LCST of Au@PNIPAM-co-HMImAcr was lower than Au@PNIPAM-co-AMImCl because
of the more hydrophobic nature of HMImAcr. Later, keeping the bromide
ion as the anion, the chain length of IL was increased from hexyl–methyl
to allyl–octyl, which was apt enough to show the LCST similar
to that of PNIPAM at 10 nm of Au size. Then, the same dependency was
observed on the NP size.

The results became more fascinating
when we further decreased the hydrophilicity in the IL structure and
changed it to AOIMTFSI. For Au@PNIPAM-co-AOImTFSI,
the general trend remained same, but when the Au NP size was 10 nm,
its LCST was even lowered compared to that of PNIPAM. The reason for
this circumstance can be that AOImTSI has a long alkyl chain (octyl)
and bulky bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion, both of which
are much hydrophobic in nature. Thus, hydrophobicity of both the cation
and anion in the IL became so dominant that the LCST was lowered from
32 to 23 °C.

To picture the image of how captivating the
dependency of NP size and IL structure is on the LCST of these Au@PNIPAM-co-ILs, a three-dimensional plot was created as represented
as in Figure 5. The
LCST is contingent upon the Au NP size and IL structure. Careful investigation
of the 3D plot portrayed the increase in phase transition temperature
of the film can be seen as a function of the size of NPs. Thus, this
conveys the fact that LCST is independently yet synergistically dependent
on both the factors. Both can be individually or equally worked upon
to tune the LCST of the colored copolymer film. Hence, it is possible
to widen the temperature range of PNIPAM from 32 to 23–67 °C.
As four of the ILs showed a similar trend, it becomes viable to assume
the trend might be followed by another types of ILs. This can aid
in the customization of the phase behavior of the materials tailored
to the user’s needs.

of type of IL in copolymers and size of Au on LCST of Au NP-induced
copolymers.

To study the effect of change
on concentration of NPs in the hybrid, different concentrations of
NPs (Table 3) were
added while preparing the hybrids. The DSC was performed and evaluated
as in Figure 6. It
was seen that as the concentration of NPs increases, the LCST temperature
increases (Figure 7). As expected, if the concentration of NPs in the hybrid is high,
the frequency to act as anchors is enhanced, thereby delaying the
formation of hydrophobic globules. Hence, it was seen that concentration
of NPs does play an important role in determining the phase transition
temperature of these NP-based hybrids.

To investigate
the mechanism of Au NPs on the film further, control experiments were
also carried out wherein, no NPs were added while synthesizing the
films. Therefore, the films obtained were PNIPAM-co-IL and their LCST was recorded as shown in Table 4. As already observed by our group in previous
reports,18 IL can also alter the LCST of
PNIPAM up to a certain limit, which was observed in this case as well.
This study reveals that Au NPs do play an important role in modifying
the LCST of copolymer. It was very keen to discover that all PNIPAM-co-IL films show LCST as if they were induced with the Au
NP of size 20–24 nm. This becomes interesting as there might
be the threshold of rotation caused by the hydrophobic bonds. Irrespective
of the kind of IL used, the LCST lies as if size of diameter is in
this range. The reason presumed can be similar as already discussed.
Smaller sized NPs might not be powerful enough to hinder the bond
rotations. As the size decreases, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of
the IL structure might play a dominant role.

Researchers have already
prepared PNIPAM-Au NP-based hydrogels via grafting-to and grafting-from
approaches.54 They showed that factors
like molecular weight, size of NPs and temperature play an important
role for the swelling/shrinking/aggregation and cloud point (LCST)
of the systems. Gibson et al.13 have prepared
PNIPAM-coated NPs with molecular weight being 2800, 5700, and 11300
g/mol while varying the NP size from 15 to 40 nm. They showed that
there is no LCST when the molecular weight is 2800 g/mol, while with
5700 g/mol, it was 74 °C. This showed that molecular weight is
an important factor to determine the LCST of this system. Our results
showed that Au@PNIPAM-co-IL show LCST even when the
molecular weight is low enough because of strong plasma resonance.

Conclusions
Novel Au NP-embedded PNIPAM-co-IL polymers were systematically designed and were elucidated for
their phase transition properties. NP size was varied from 10 to 35
nm. Structures of polymerizable IL were varied by changing both the
cation and anion specifically. LCST can be altered by varying the
size of NPs used or the concentration of the NPs used or changing
the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity in the IL structure. All the factors
played an essential role in tuning the LCST and that can widen the
range to 23–67 °C. The results can be utilized for the
profound understanding of the LCST behavior of PNIPAM-based materials,
its mechanism, and effect of NPs. The present tuning provides a fruitful
strategy for custom-designed thermo-sensitive materials and their
applications.

mg, 0.086 mmol) were added to the solution and were sonicated for
5 minutes to completely solubilize, and 7.8 × 10–12 mmol Au NP solution6,60 (of required size) in water was
added. (Different concentrations of NPs viz., 6.9 × 10–11, 1.4 × 10–9, 2.1 × 10–9 mmol were added to study the concentration dependence). The resulting
mixture was put to a plastic vial, and 80 μL of 5 wt % APS as
a polymerization initiator was added. The mixture was heated in a
