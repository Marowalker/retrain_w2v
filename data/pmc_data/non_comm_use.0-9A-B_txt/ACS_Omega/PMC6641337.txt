Steady-state
and time-resolved fluorescence techniques as well
as quantum-mechanical calculations were used to study the photophysics
and photochemistry of a newly synthesized photoacid—the phenol
cyanine picolinium salt. We found that the nonradiative rate constant knr of the excited protonated form of the photoacid
is larger than that of the excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) to
the solvent, kESPT. We estimate that the
quantum efficiency of the ESPT process is about 0.16. The nonradiative
process is explained by a partial trans–cis isomerization reaction,
which leads to the formation of a “dark” excited state
that can cross to the ground state by nonadiabatic coupling. Moreover,
the ESPT process is coupled to the photo-isomerization reaction, as
this latter reaction enhances the photoacidity of the studied compound,
as a result of photoinduced charge transfer. To prevent trans–cis
isomerization of the cyanine bridge, we conducted experiments of PCyP
adsorbed on cellulose in the presence of water. We found that the
steady-state fluorescence intensity increased by about a factor of
50 and the lifetime of the ROH band increased by the same factor.
The fluorescence intensity of the RO– band with
respect to that of the ROH band was the same as in aqueous solution.
This explains why inhibiting the photo-isomerization reaction by adsorbing
the PCyP on cellulose does not lead to a higher ESPT rate.

Introduction
Photoacids are compounds
that are weak acids in their ground electronic
state and much stronger acids in their first excited singlet electronic
state. Usually, the ground-state pKa values
are in the range of 5–10, whereas their excited-state pKa* can vary from −8 to 3. When time-resolved techniques are
employed to study the photoacidity of a photoacid, the excited-state
proton transfer (ESPT) rate constant is evaluated from the decay of
the protonated form of the photoacid or from the rise time of the
deprotonated-form signal. The ESPT rate constant, kPT, of photoacids varies from 1013 s–1 (τPT ≈ 100 fs) to 108 s–1 (τPT = 10 ns).

Photoacids can be classified
into four groups. Regime I includes
the weak photoacids with pKa* ≥ 0.4. These photoacids can transfer
a proton to water as a solvent within the excited-state lifetime but
not to alcohols such as methanol or higher alkanols. The second regime
includes stronger photoacids of which the pKa* values are in
the range of −4 ≤ pKa* ≤ 0.4. These photoacids
can undergo an ESPT process not only to water but also to other protic
solvents such as alcohols and dimethyl sulfoxide. The third group
(regime III) includes even stronger photoacids with pKa* values of
about −5. The rate of the ESPT process is of the order of translation
and orientation time of protic solvents. The ESPT rate depends on
the motion of the solvent because the solvent is the proton acceptor
and the barrier height, and the motion along the reaction coordinate
in the Marcus description of the electron- and proton-transfer reactions
depends on the solvent coordinate.1 This
regime is referred to as the “solvent-controlled ESPT rate”.
In water, the solvent-controlled ESPT rate constant is about 1012 s–1 because the solvent-reorientation
time of water is ∼1 ps. The fourth class (regime IV) is the
“beyond-the-solvent-controlled” regime. The pKa* of photoacids in this regime is <−6.5, and the ESPT rate
constant, kPT, is >1012 s–1. The fastest recorded ESPT rate is that of quinone
cyanine 9 (QCy9), for which kPT ≈
1013 s–1 (τPT ≈
100 fs).2

Photoacids have been studied
extensively for the last 50 years
by steady-state methods and time-resolved techniques.3−18 These techniques are frequently used in the study of photoacids
and the ESPT rate. More recently, transient infrared spectroscopy
has provided more structure-accurate information on the ESPT process.7−9

In the current work, we have focused our attention on a newly
synthesized
photoacid, as shown in Scheme 1a—the PCyP salt. This photoacid has an ultrafast ESPT
rate constant that competes with a nonradiative process to the ground
state which would prevent a large quantum yield of the ESPT process.
In this article, we also compare the photoprotolytic properties of
the current photoacid, the PCyP compound, with two other stronger
photoacids based on the same structure—the phenol benzoate
cyanine picolinium salt and the CBCyP salt.19,20 Both are shown in Scheme 1.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
the steady-state fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of PCyP
in slightly acidic (pH ≈ 6) H2O and in basic H2O solution (pH ≈ 10).

Figure 1 (a) Normalized steady-state excitation
and emission spectra of
PCyP in slightly acidic H2O, collected at λ = 540
nm and excited at λ = 370 nm, respectively. (b) Normalized steady-state
excitation and emission spectra of PCyP in basic pH H2O,
excited at λ = 410 nm and λ = 480 nm, respectively.

At pH ≈ 6, the ground-state
PCyP photoacid is in the protonated
ROH form. The excitation-spectrum maximum is at ∼370 nm and
the emission-spectrum maximum is at ∼524 nm. We assign these
maxima to the absorption and emission ROH bands. At 650 nm, there
is a signal buried in the ROH fluorescence tail which we assign to
the RO– band that originates from the excited-state
proton transfer (ESPT) to the solvent. Figure 1b shows the excitation and emission spectra
of PCyP photoacid in basic aqueous solution at pH ≈ 10. The
excitation-spectrum maximum is at about 530 nm, and the fluorescence
spectrum maximum is at ∼650 nm. The intensity of the steady-state
fluorescence spectrum of the ROH fluorescence is about four times
that of the RO– fluorescence.

Figure 2a,b shows,
on linear and semilogarithmic scales, the time-resolved fluorescence
of PCyP in slightly acidic (pH ≈ 6) aqueous solution.

Figure 2 Time-resolved
emission of PCyP in slightly acidic (pH ≈
6) aqueous solution, measured over the wavelength range of 470–650
nm, shown on a (a) linear scale and a (b) semilog scale; (c) only
630 and 650 nm (RO– band) are displayed.

The signals were acquired by the fluorescence upconversion
technique
at several wavelengths over the spectral range of 470–650 nm.
The normalized signal between 470 and 550 nm overlaps the ROH steady-state
fluorescence band. The decay of the signals is nonexponential with
short-, intermediate-, and long-time components. We used a multiexponential
function to fit the experimental signals. The fit parameters are given
in Table S1a in the Supporting Information section.

At low wavelengths, ≤490 nm, the short-time
component has
a decay time of ∼160 fs and an amplitude of about 0.6. At higher
wavelengths, ≥500 nm, the decay time of the short-time component
is about 220 fs, and its amplitude decreases as the fluorescence-monitored
wavelength increases to about 0.27 at 580 nm. The intermediate-time
component ranges from 700 fs at the low wavelength to about 1000 fs
at 530 nm. The amplitude of the intermediate component increases with
the wavelength increase. The amplitude of the long-time component
increases with the increasing wavelength. The time constant is about
6 ps. At high wavelengths, >610 nm, the signal shows rise components
followed by a nearly exponential decay (Figure 2c). These signals overlap the RO– fluorescence band. The rise component fits the short- and intermediate-time
components of the ROH time-resolved signals. The decay time of the
RO– signal is about 6 ps (τ3 in
Table S1 of the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 shows the
steady-state excitation and fluorescence spectra of PCyP in D2O in neutral pH (3a) and basic solutions
(pH ≈ 11) (3b).

Figure 3 a) Normalized steady-state
emission (excited at λ = 400 nm)
and excitation (collected at λ = 540 nm) spectra of PCyP in
acidic D2O. (b) Normalized steady-state emission (excited
at λ = 460 nm) and excitation (collected at λ = 640 nm)
spectra of PCyP in basic D2O.

The steady-state excitation and emission spectra are similar
to
those obtained in H2O. The maximum of the ROH excitation
spectrum is at about 370 nm, and the fluorescence maximum is at about
524 nm. At ∼650 nm, the RO– band is scarcely
seen when the ROD ground-state form is excited in neutral D2O. The RO– band seen in Figure 3a arises as a consequence of the ESPT process.
Because the RO– form has a very short lifetime (∼12
ps) and the emission cross section is rather small, the overall steady-state
fluorescence band intensity of the RO– band is small.
In basic solution, the RO– excitation band in D2O has the same shape and position as in H2O and
the fluorescence band is similar to that in H2O.

Figure 4 shows the
time-resolved fluorescence signals of PCyP in neutral D2O solution measured over the spectral range of 470–650 nm.

Figure 4 Time-resolved
emission of PCyP in D2O, measured over
the wavelength range of 470–650 nm, shown on a (a) linear scale
and a (b) semilog scale.

The normalized signal decay is nonexponential at short wavelengths
(<590 nm). We fit the signals in that spectral range by a three-exponent
fit function. The signal-fit parameters are given in Table S1b in
the Supporting Information section. The
decay time of the short-time component is about 280 fs while that
of H2O is shorter, 170 fs at λ < 500 nm. The decay
time of the intermediate-time component in D2O is about
1200 fs versus 700 fs in H2O at short (<500 nm) wavelengths.
The decay time of the long-time component in D2O is about
12 ps versus 6 ps in H2O. At long wavelengths (>610
nm),
the signals of PCyP in D2O (as also in H2O)
show two distinct rise components of 200 and 1200 fs followed by an
exponential decay with a time constant of ∼12 ps, which we
assign to the fluorescence decay of the RO– form
of PCyP in D2O. The rise-component fit of the RO– form approximately matches the two shorter decay components of the
ROH form of PCyP in D2O. The time-resolved fluorescence
signals of PCyP in D2O support the fact that an ESPT process
takes place when the ROD form is excited.

Figure 5 shows the
time-resolved fluorescence on linear and semilogarithmic scales of
H2O and D2O at four wavelengths.

Figure 5 Time-resolved emission
of PCyP in H2O and D2O shown on a linear scale,
measured at wavelengths of (a) 480 and
(c) 500 nm and on a semilog scale, measured at wavelengths of (b)
480 (d) 500 nm.

Each panel shows two
signals, that of H2O and of D2O at a certain
wavelength. At short wavelengths, (<550
nm), the main contribution to the signal arises from the decay of
the ROH form. The decay is governed by the ESPT process, and its rate
is smaller in D2O, as seen in the signals displayed in
the panels. Table S2 in the Supporting Information section provides the values of the average decay time of the signals
of PCyP in H2O and D2O, where , and IF(λ,t) is normalized.

As
seen in Table S2, τavλ is higher
in D2O. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) can be approximated
by the simple relation  The
average value of the KIE at short wavelengths,
(≤530 nm), is 1.87.

With the Förster-cycle calculation,21 one can estimate the change in acidity upon
excitation of the molecule.
This calculation is based on the positions of the optical absorption
or emission bands of the protonated and deprotonated forms of a photoacid.
The energy cycle leads to a simple relation between band positions
and change in acidity in the excited state with respect to the ground-state
pKa. 1   2  where C is
a factor of universal constants 3  Δν
is the difference between the
positions of the ROH* and RO–* bands given in wavenumber
units (cm–1). Δν for the fluorescence
band peaks of ROH and RO– forms of PCyP is 3700
cm–1 and pKa is about
6.7. The pKa* for these values is about −1.1. Δν
calculated from the ROH and RO– absorption spectra
maxima is ∼4090 cm–1 and the pKa* is slightly
more negative (∼−1.8).

Comparison of Three Phenol
Cyanine Picolinium Salt Photoacids
Figure 6 shows the
steady-state fluorescence spectra of the recently synthesized three
PCyP photoacids shown in Scheme 1. The pH of the aqueous solution was slightly acidic
(5 < pH < 6), and the ROH form of the photoacid was excited.

Figure 6 Steady-state
fluorescence spectra of PCyP, BCyP, and CBCyP, shown
in Scheme 1.

The steady-state fluorescence
intensity ratio IRO–/IROH of the RO– and
ROH bands for CBCyP is the largest
of the three. The BCyP is intermediate and for the currently studied
photoacid, the PCyP, the fluorescence ratio is the smallest. Weller22 used a qualitative equation to estimate the
ESPT rate constant from the steady-state fluorescence spectrum 4  where IRO– and IROH are the intensities of
the RO– and ROH fluorescence bands of the steady-state
spectrum, and τF is the lifetime of the RO– band. The equation is more accurate when  and the oscillator strengths of both S1 → S0 transitions are the same. In fact,
the RO– fluorescence band intensity is so small
in PCyP that it is buried in the tail of the ROH fluorescence. The
steady-state fluorescence intensity of the RO– band
depends on the oscillator strength of the S1 → S0 transition, the nonradiative rates of both ROH and RO– forms of the photoacid and the ESPT rate. When the
nonradiative rate of the ROH form of a photoacid is higher than the
ESPT rate, the ESPT quantum yield is small.

Figure 7 shows,
on linear and semilog scales, the time-resolved fluorescence signal
of the ROH form of the three PCyP photoacids measured at 480 and 500
nm.

Figure 7 Time-resolved emission of PCyP, BCyP, and CBCyP (shown in Scheme 1) in aqueous solution,
measured at a wavelength of 480 nm near the ROH peak: (a) linear scale
(b) semilog scale and at 500 nm (c) linear scale (d) semilog scale.

At 500 nm, the average decay time,
τav = ∫I(t) dt, is 310 fs for
CBCyP, 900 fs for BCyP, and > 3000 fs for the PCyP. The signals
for
the decay of all the three compounds are nonexponential and could
be fitted by four exponentials. For chlorobenzoate, the amplitude
of the major component at 500 nm is about 0.83, and the decay time
is about 165 fs. The amplitude of the second time component is about
0.1, and the decay time is about 500 fs. For the benzoate compound,
the amplitude of the major component at 500 nm is about 0.74, and
the decay time is about 380 fs. The second component has an amplitude
of 0.19 and a lifetime of ∼1.4 ps. For the phenol (PCyP) compound,
the major component at 500 nm has an amplitude of ∼0.44 and
a lifetime of 220 fs. The second time component has an amplitude of
∼0.44 and a lifetime of 750 fs. The third time component at
500 nm has an amplitude of ∼0.12 and a lifetime of about 6
ps.

As seen in Figure 7, for the chlorobenzoate and the benzoate compounds, the amplitude
of the third time component, with a long decay time, is much smaller
than that of the phenol (PCyP) analog. The nonexponential decay of
the fluorescence of PCyP arises from processes that are nonexponential
and faster than the ESPT process. Solvation dynamics are nonexponential.
Maroncelli et al.23 have studied this process
and found that they can fit the time-dependent (TD) red shift of coumarin
153 in many solvents by the four exponential fit function that spans
from about 100 fs to tens of picoseconds in alcohols. The PCyP molecule
has a floppy cyanine bridge that tends to twist after excitation to
the first excited singlet state. This process is also nonexponential.
These processes in PCyP are faster than the ESPT process and therefore
the nonexponential fluorescence decay.

Figure 8 shows the
time-resolved fluorescence of the ROH form of chlorobenzoate cyanine
picolinium (CBCyP) in the spectral range of 470–530 nm. The
signals are almost the same. This fact indicates that the ESPT takes
place before solvation and half-twist of the cyanine bridge take place.

Figure 8 Time-resolved
fluorescence of CBCyP in slightly acidic (pH ≈
6) H2O, monitored at several wavelengths over the spectral
range of 470–530 nm.

We suspect that for the PCyP compound, the third time component
of 6 ps is the actual combined rate constant of the nonradiative and
ESPT processes. The signal of PCyP at short times is assigned to the
solvent response of the molecule. An ESPT process is also taking place
during the solvation time, but the ESPT efficiency is much lower than
that of the two analog compounds, the chlorobenzoate and the benzoate.
The main process of the excited state of the PCyP compound is a nonradiative
process. We conclude that because the steady-state fluorescence spectrum
almost lacks the RO– fluorescence band, the ESPT
efficiency is very low, and we estimate it to be about 16%.

The overall fluorescence-decay rate constant of the ROH band is 5  

The three major processes
are 6  where knr and kr are the nonradiative
and radiative rate constants.
The ESPT efficiency is given by 7  If kr ≪ knr, kESPT and knr = 5kESPT, then .

The signals at short times (τ < 1 ps) are strongly influenced
by solvation processes and trans–cis isomerization that leads
to a nonradiative process. From an examination of the steady-state
fluorescence spectra of the three analog compounds, it is seen that
the chlorobenzoate compound (CBCyP) has a band-intensity ratio (IRO–/IROH) of ∼6, whereas for the benzoate compound (BCyP), IRO–/IROH ≈ 1.5 and for the phenol compound, (PCyP), IRO–/IROH < 0.12. If we assume that the oscillator strengths of
the ROH and RO– bands, as well as the nonradiative
rates, are similar for all three compounds, then kESPT for the CBCyP is six times that of BCyP and that
of PCyP is smaller than that of CBCyP by a factor of about 36.

Figure 9 shows the
time-resolved fluorescence signals of the RO– form
in D2O of the three photoacids measured at 650 nm, near
the band peak of the RO– fluorescence.

emission of PCyP, BCyP, and CBCyP (shown in Scheme 1) in D2O, measured at 650 nm,
near the RO– peak: (a) linear
scale (b) semilog scale.

Figure 9 shows
that
the time-resolved fluorescence signal of the RO– form of the three photoacids in D2O is similar at short
times of ∼8 ps and that the rise time and decay of the signals
are about the same. As a result of band overlap, the signals measured
at 650 nm also contain a contribution of the signal of the ROH form
because the oscillator strength of the ROH form is much greater than
that of the RO– form that has the character of a
charge-transfer state which carries much lower oscillator strength.

PCyP Adsorbed on Cellulose
Figure 10 shows the steady-state fluorescence spectra
of PCyP adsorbed on cellulose powder of 20 μm.

Figure 10 Steady-state fluorescence
spectra of two PCyP samples adsorbed
on cellulose powder of 20 μm. One sample is in water and the
other is semidry.

The samples were excited
at 390 nm, near the maximum of the S0 → S1 absorption band. The spectra were
measured at the front-surface excitation and fluorescence collection
mode. The first sample is that of the semidry sample after the PCyP
was sprayed by 30 μL of methanol solution on the cellulose powder
that was glued on a silica disc of 40 mm diameter. The spectrum lacks
the fluorescence band of the deprotonated RO– form.
The second spectrum is of PCyP adsorbed on cellulose powder of 50
mg sprayed with 50 μL of water. The spectrum of this sample
clearly shows the emission band of the RO– form
with a band maximum at 650 nm.

Figure 11 shows
the time-resolved fluorescence of PCyP adsorbed on cellulose measured
by the time-correlated single-photon-count (TCSPC) technique.

Figure 11 Time-resolved
fluorescence signals of PCyP adsorbed on cellulose,
in 50 μL of water and in a semidry condition, measured by the
TCSPC technique at wavelengths of (a) 500, (b) 520, (c) 540, and (d)
650 nm.

The signal intensities are about
100-fold more intense than in
solution. Each panel in the figure displays two measurements made,
at a particular wavelength, of PCyP adsorbed on semidry cellulose
after spraying 30 μL of methanol solution of PCyP on 50 mg of
cellulose. The second sample shows the TCSPC signal of PCyP after
the addition of 50 μL of water to the semidry PCyP cellulose
samples.

The decay of the fluorescence signals of the PCyP adsorbed
on cellulose
with and without water is nonexponential. When water is added to the
samples, the average lifetime of the fluorescence is much shorter
than is the case for the semidry samples. Table 1 provides the values of τav in nanoseconds of the semidry samples and the samples containing
water.

The most important
achievement of the study of time-resolved fluorescence
of PCyP adsorbed on cellulose has been to show that a nonradiative
process occurs in PCyP in solution at a rapid rate for both the ROH
and RO– forms of the photoacid. In previous studies
of molecular rotors adsorbed on cellulose,24 we were able to reduce the nonradiative process of molecular rotors
such as thioflavin-T (ThT) and auramine-O (AuO). The molecular rotors
have a short fluorescence lifetime of a few picoseconds in liquids
with viscosities of 1–10 cP.25 The
lifetime of ThT and AuO is linear with the solvent viscosity. When
adsorbed on cellulose, the ThT lifetime is about 1.6 ns and the fluorescence
quantum yield increases by a factor of 1000 when compared with ethanol
solution where τav(490 nm) ≈ 2 ps.

When
water is added to cellulose, the ESPT to water takes place.
In a previous work, we presented an ESPT study of 8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonate
(HPTS) adsorbed on cellulose.26,27 There are two kinds
of water in wet cellulose, water adsorbed on the skeleton of the polysaccharide
and water in small pools next to the polysaccharide skeleton.28,29 We found that for HPTS, the ESPT process has two rate constants.
We assigned the larger ESPT rate to the proton transfer to the water
pool and the smaller rate to water adsorbed on the polysaccharide
skeleton. The time-resolved signals of PCyP adsorbed on wet cellulose
also show a bimodal decay that could be assigned, as in the case of
HPTS, to two kinds of ESPT rates to the two water domains next to
wet cellulose.

To summarize this subsection, the protonated
ROH form of PCyP in
H2O undergoes two processes in the excited state, a nonradiative
process due to the trans–cis isomerization of the cyanine bridge
and the ESPT process. The higher rate constant is that of the nonradiative
process, and therefore, the ESPT efficiency is about 0.16, as in bulk
water. We expected to find that upon adsorption of PCyP on cellulose,
the fluorescence intensity ratio IRO–/IROH in the steady-state spectrum
would increase approximately tenfold because the kESPT rate would be about the same as in water, but knr would be lower by at least a factor of ten.
We find instead a rather small increase in IRO–/IROH when
PCyP is adsorbed on cellulose. Both the ROH and RO– average lifetimes increase by a factor of 100. From the steady-state
and time-resolved fluorescence results, we conclude that the ESPT
process is coupled to the isomerization, and the ESPT rate, kPT, slows when knr does. QM computation studies that are described below indeed show
the coupling of the ESPT process and the cis–trans isomerization
process.

When PCyP is adsorbed on cellulose, the potential barrier
ΔG† of both excited-state
processes, the
nonradiative and the ESPT processes, increases and the reaction rate
of both processes decreases by a factor of about 100. In water solution,
the potential barrier for an ESPT process is low because ΔG of the ESPT reaction in liquid solution is low or negative.
The concept of the free-energy relation between ΔG and ΔG† is part of the
Marcus electron-transfer theory. When the RO– of
a photoacid is stabilized and ΔG is negative,
then ΔG† is low. This takes
place when the negative charge of the phenolate is reduced by intramolecular
charge rearrangement and the electron density on the oxygen of the
phenolate is transferred to the picolinium positive moiety through
the conjugate cyanine bridge. Our recent finding is that the electron
density is reduced only when trans–cis isomerization occurs.
We suggest that the electrons of the cyanine bridge are delocalized
when trans–cis isomerization takes place, and this enables
the rearrangement of the electric charge. The end result for PCyP
is a negative ΔG and small ΔG† for the ESPT process and a high kESPT in water and small kESPT when adsorbed on cellulose.

Computation Results
The C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle
of PCyP (numbering can be seen in Figure 12A) has a minimum potential at 179.7°
in the S0 state in the aqueous phase. To analyze the potential
role of trans–cis isomerization in the fluorescence quenching
of this molecule, a relaxed scan was made by decreasing the C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle by 9°/step. The energies of the S0 and S1 states are shown in Figure 12B.

of the trans–cis isomerization reaction (B). Oscillator strength
of the S1 state as a function of dihedral-angle variation
(C). The arrows in Figure 12B indicate the possible pathway for S1 →
S0 de-excitation.

S0 trans–cis isomerization is unfavorable,
as
there is a high reaction barrier of 55.6 kcal·mol–1, which occurs at a dihedral angle of 62.7°. Moreover, no structure
is more energetically stable than the initial one with a dihedral
angle of 179.7°. In fact, the structures more energetically close
to the initial one are the ones with dihedral angles of 8.7°
and −0.3°, which are still less stable than that of the
reactant by 3.8 kcal·mol–1. Nevertheless, after
the energy barrier is overcome, the relative S0 energies
decrease continuously without the presence of another energy barrier.
It should be noted that the S0 potential curve is asymmetric.
However, this is because the two moieties connected by the cyanine
bridge (picolinium and phenol) are not symmetric. Also, as can be
seen in Figure 13,
while the reactant structure has these two moieties far apart, the
trans–cis isomerization makes them closer.

reaction appears to be favorable in the S1 state. The energy
barrier is only 16.5 kcal·mol–1, and the structures
with dihedral angles of 71.7° and 62.7° are more stable
than the initial structure (with a dihedral angle of 179.7°)
by 16.1 and 8.3 kcal·mol–1, respectively. If
implicit solvation is modeled with the SMD model instead, which includes
nonelectrostatic terms in the calculation,30 this energy barrier decreases to 15.2 kcal·mol–1. It should be noted that the S1 energy barrier is reached
earlier in the reaction (corresponding to a dihedral angle of 80.7°)
than the S0 barrier (corresponding to a dihedral angle
of 62.7°). Also, between the structures with dihedral angles
of 71.7° and 53.7°, there is another S1 energy
barrier. So, after the reaction reaches the structure with a dihedral
angle of 71.7°, the reaction cannot proceed in either direction,
with this structure acting as a S1 energy minimum. From
the dihedral angle of 71.7°, there is an S1 energy
barrier of 23.8 kcal·mol–1 toward smaller dihedral
angles and another of 32.6 kcal·mol–1 toward
larger dihedral angles. Thus, our calculations indicate that the ring-rotation
reaction is favorable in the S1 state but apparently only
between dihedral angles of ∼180° and ∼70°.
As a result, the trans–cis isomerization is not fully achieved
in the S1 state.

Figure 14A presents
the S1 electrostatic potential (ESP) atomic charges31 for the picolinium, cyanine, and phenol moieties
of PCyP. Up until the energy barrier, the ESP charges of the cyanine
moiety change very little, indicating that this moiety has a small
role in the trans–cis isomerization. That is not the case for
the picolinium and the phenol moieties, as there is an intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) between them. There is a transfer of negative
charge of about −0.104e from the picolinium
to the phenol group, up until the energy barrier is reached. Also
notable is the ICT process occurring between all three moieties, starting
from the vicinities of the S1 energy barrier to the S1 energy minimum (the structure with a dihedral angle of 71.7°).
There is a significant transfer of negative charge from the phenol
to both the cyanine bridge and the picolinium moiety. From that point
on, there are some other processes of ICT, which should not be relevant,
as our calculations indicated that the reaction cannot reach structures
with dihedral angles smaller than ∼70°.

For explaining the fluorescence-quenching
mechanism of PCyP and
its derivatives, the most important region of the S1 potential–energy–surface
(PES) is that which follows the energy barrier at a dihedral angle
of 80.7°, namely, the structure with a C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle
of 71.7° (Figure 12). While the S0–S1 energy gap for the
other structures varies between 53.4 and 84.8 kcal·mol–1, this gap for two structures is significantly smaller: 13.9 (dihedral
angle of 71.7°) and 15.2 (dihedral angle of 62.7°) kcal·mol–1. This small S0–S1 energy
gap indicates that both states are nearly degenerated, and so allow
the identification of a S1 → S0 de-excitation
pathway: nonadiabatic coupling between the S0 and S1 states, as a result of rotation of a C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle
(Figure 12B). Moreover,
as the point of nonadiabatic coupling (dihedral angle of 71.7°)
is reached earlier in the reaction than the S0 energy barrier
(dihedral angle of 62.7°), upon S1 → S0 de-excitation, the reaction should proceed energetically
toward the PCyP reactant structure (dihedral angle of 179.7°).
This is visually displayed by the arrows in Figure 12B.

While smaller S0–S1 energy gaps might
be expected for the identification of a region for nonadiabatic coupling,
reports in the literature indicate that multireference calculations
will surely predict smaller energy gaps between S0 and
S1.32−41 In different systems, while TD-DFT calculations predict S0–S1 energy gaps of the magnitude obtained here
(about 14 kcal·mol–1), multireference calculations
identified the presence of conical intersections or nonadiabatic coupling
(S0–S1 energy gap lower than 5 kcal·mol–1).32−41 This results from the role of multireference correlation in systems
where S0 and S1 are degenerated/nearly degenerated.40,41 The energetic error present in the TD-DFT calculations may arise
from spin contamination in the reference state.32,33 However, while multireference methods are obviously important to
obtain more quantitative pictures of systems such as these, they may
be too computationally demanding to employ in situations where solvation
and more structurally complex systems are involved. Thus, we have
employed a long-range corrected hybrid exchange–correlation
density functional (ωB97XD), which performs well for predicting
local, CT, and Rydberg excitation.44,56 This type
of approach can provide quite accurate qualitative pictures for systems
presenting S0–S1 degeneracy.32−35

While the other structures are all closed-shell species, the
structures
with dihedral angles of 71.7° and 62.7° are not. In fact,
in the S0 state, they possess a (S2) value of 0.1240 (dihedral angle of 71.7°) and 0.3982
(dihedral angle of 62.7°).

Another factor of interest is
the variation of the oscillator strength
as a function of the C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle (Figure 12C). While the oscillator strength is high
upon photoexcitation (1.24 at a dihedral angle of 179.7°), it
decreases with lowering of the dihedral-angle value. In fact, it reaches
a value of 0.04 (a very large decrease by a factor of ∼30 in
the oscillator strength) in the structure with the dihedral angle
of 71.7° (the structure with the lowest S0–S1 energy gap and which corresponds to the S1 energetic
minimum). Thus, even if we do not take into account the de-excitation
pathway based on nonadiabatic coupling, the trans–cis isomerization
in itself provides another explanation for the fluorescence quenching:
the arrival at a structure for which the S1 state is a
“dark” state. Compared with the initial structure possessing
a C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle of 179.7°, the structure with a dihedral
angle of 71.7° is clearly an ICT state (Figure 14A). There is the transfer of negative charge
(−0.280e) from the phenol groups to the picolinium
(−0.074e) and to the cyanine moieties (−0.206e). Thus, while the cyanine bridge appears not to be of
such importance for the evolution of the reaction toward the S1 energy barrier, it is important for the formation of the
“dark” ICT state.

If the trans–cis isomerization
reaction of PCyP explains
the fluorescence quenching of this molecule and provides a competing
pathway for ESPT, adsorbing PCyP on cellulose should increase the
fluorescence intensity and favor the ESPT reaction. However, this
was not observed experimentally (see Figures 10 and 11). The steady-state
fluorescence intensity of both emission bands of PCyP increased by
a factor of 100, but the IRO–/IROH did not increase by much.
Thus, these data suggest that the ESPT reaction is linked to the trans–cis
isomerization reaction, and so, decreasing the yield of the latter
reaction (by adsorbing PCyP on cellulose) should also affect the photoacidity
of the phenol group.

The source of enhanced photoacidity of
a given molecule is explained
by the anionic side of the ESPT reaction.11,42 That is, photoinduced charge transfer reduces the negative charge
on the hydroxyl oxygen (in comparison with the S0 state),
making it a weaker base in the excited state and energetically stabilizing
the anion form of the photoacid.

Figure 14B shows
the difference between the ESP atomic charge of the hydroxyl oxygen
in the S1 and S0 states, as a function of the
C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle. This atom is always more electronegative
in the S0 than in the S1 state, making it a
weaker base in the excited state. However, while the difference in
the reactant structure (dihedral angle of 179.7°) is 0.068e, this difference decreases with decreasing values of the
dihedral angle, reaching a value of only 0.001e in
the “dark” ICT state (dihedral angle of 71.7°).
Thus, the rotation of the C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle prevents the ESPT reaction,
up to a dihedral angle of 71.7°, by diminishing the difference
in basicity of the hydroxyl oxygen between the S1 and S0 states. From the dihedral angle of 71.7° on, there is
a significant increase in the difference in electronegativity, reaching
a value of 0.104e at a dihedral angle of 8.7°.
At this point, the hydroxyl oxygen is a significantly weaker base
in the S1 state than in the S0 state, theoretically
enabling the ESPT reaction. However, the dihedral angle of 8.7°
is reached only after fluorescence quenching has occurred.

Thus,
in conclusion, the ESPT process is linked to the trans–cis
isomerization, as is the rotation of the C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle
that enables the ESPT by making the hydroxyl oxygen a significantly
weaker base in the S1 state. Nevertheless, this only occurs
after fluorescence quenching which, in practice, means that the ESPT
reaction does not occur. As the ESPT reaction is dependent on the
trans–cis isomerization, decreasing the yield of the latter
process also decreases the yield of the former, which explains the
results obtained in cellulose.

We also calculated the trans–cis
isomerization of anionic
PCyP in implicit water (Figure 15A). The reaction is not favored in the S0 state, with no structure being energetically more stable than the
reactant (dihedral angle of 179.8°). This is similar to what
was observed earlier for the neutral species. Nevertheless, the S0 energy barrier for anionic PCyP (27.2 kcal·mol–1) is smaller by 28.3 kcal·mol–1 than the one
for the neutral species (55.6 kcal·mol–1).
This decrease may be due to the approximation between the cationic
picolinium and anionic phenolate moieties during the reaction, leading
to favorable electrostatic interactions. In the isomerization reaction
of anionic PCyP, no open-shell structures were found. Contrary to
the neutral species, the S1 trans–cis isomerization
is not energetically favored (Figure 15A). While the energy barrier is only 16.2 kcal·mol–1, all remaining structures are less stable than the
reactant by at least 6.9 kcal·mol–1. Nevertheless,
the oscillator strength of the Franck–Condon S1 state
decreases with the decreasing dihedral angle (Figure 15B), the same as for the neutral species.

The S1 ESP
charge transfer between the picolinium, cyanine,
and phenol moieties (as a function of the C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angle)
is presented in Figure 15C. These results show that the trans–cis isomerization
of anionic PCyP is the result of ICT processes, mainly between the
picolinium and phenolate moieties. First, there is the ICT of negative
charge from the picolinium moiety to the phenolate ring, up until
the S1 energy barrier is reached. After this point, the
reaction is dominated by reverse negative-charge transfer, from the
phenolate to picolinium. The S1 ESP charge of the phenolate
oxygen is also affected by these ICT processes (Figure 15C). There is an increase of
0.042e in the negative charge from the reactant to
the energy barrier. From that barrier on, the negative charge decreases
by 0.167e.

It should be noted that our calculations
of the neutral trans–cis
isomerization indicated that the possibility of ESPT exists only for
C5–C8–C9–C10 dihedral angles smaller than 70° (Figure 14). The calculations for the
anionic reaction showed that in dihedral angles of that magnitude,
there is an ICT of negative charge from the phenolate to the picolinium
moiety (Figure 15C).
Moreover, the negative charge of the phenolate oxygen decreases significantly
in this region (Figure 15D). Thus, these ICT processes should stabilize the RO– species, leading to a negative ΔG and low ΔG†. By contrast,
for dihedral angles higher than 70°, ΔG should be positive and ΔG† high, leading to a low kPT. This shows
that the ESPT reaction of PCyP is coupled to the trans–cis
isomerization, namely, the ICT processes resulting from the latter
reaction.

To obtain more information about the ESPT process,
we have modeled
two PT reactions from PCyP to a single water molecule. In these reactions,
the dihedral angle of PCyP is constrained to be either 8.7° (Figure 16A) or 179.7°
(Figure 16B). The
calculations indicate that PCyP is a photoacid with either of these
dihedral angles, as the S1 energy barrier is significantly
lower (by ∼10 kcal·mol–1) than its corresponding
S0 barrier, for the two dihedral angles. Nevertheless,
our calculations support our previous conclusions in which the ESPT
reaction is more favorable with dihedral angles lower than 70°.
While the ESPT reaction with a dihedral angle of 179.7° leads
to an energy increase of 15.3 kcal·mol–1, with
a dihedral angle of 8.7°, the reaction proceeds with an increase
of only 13.8 kcal·mol–1.

Figure 16 Energetic profile of
the ESPT from PCyP to a single water molecule,

molecule, and the phenol hydroxy hydrogen, with dihedral angles of
(C) 8.7° and (D) 179.7°.

The ESPT reaction with a dihedral angle of 179.7° proceeds
by the transfer of negative charge (−0.290e) from the water molecule to the PCyP molecule (Figure 16D). This negative charge is
positioned mainly on the cyanine bridge (−0.138e) and on the phenol hydrogen (−0.082e), followed
by the picolinium (−0.051e) and phenolate
(−0.019e) moieties. This charge-transfer behavior
shows some differences from what was observed for the ESPT reaction
with a dihedral angle of 8.7° (Figure 16C). This reaction still proceeds with negative-charge
transfer (−0.277e) from the water molecule
to PCyP but receives the charge differently. The negative charge is
positioned mainly on the phenolate (−0.136e) moiety and on the cyanine bridge (−0.108e), but little on the picolinium moiety (−0.058e). In this case, the phenol hydrogen does not receive negative charge
but transfers it to the other moieties of PCyP (−0.025e). The fact that the phenolate moiety is the main receiver
of negative charge can be explained by its proximity to the positively
charged picolinium moiety, with the negative charge being important
for creating attractive electrostatic interactions. These results
also indicate that the cyanine bridge has a role as an electron reservoir
in the ESPT reactions of PCyP. It should also be noted that as both
ESPT reactions are based on charge-transfer processes, they should
be negatively affected when PCyP is adsorbed on cellulose (which has
a low dielectric constant). This should help explain why IRO–/IROH did not increase by much when PCyP was adsorbed on cellulose, especially
because PCyP has a dihedral angle of 179°, at which a higher
degree of charge transfer takes place.

Main Findings
Main Findings
of Experimental Results
1. The ESPT rate constant of PCyP to water
is smaller than 1011 s–1.

2. The nonradiative rate of the ROH form
is higher than the ESPT rate.

3. We estimate the quantum efficiency
of the proton transfer to water to be about 0.1.



Main Findings of QM Calculations
1. The fluorescence-quenching
mechanism
is explained by a partial trans–cis isomerization reaction
with a dihedral rotation from 179.7° to 71.7°.

2. This reaction leads to the formation
of a “dark” S1 state and to a de-excitation
pathway caused by nonadiabatic coupling between the S0 and
S1 states.

3. The “dark” S1 state is an ICT state, with
negative-charge transfer from the phenol
group to the picolinium and cyanine moieties.

4. The partial trans–cis isomerization
is governed by an initial negative-charge transfer from the picolinium
moiety to the phenol group, followed by back charge transfer.

5. The ESPT reaction is coupled
to the
trans–cis isomerization, as the photoacidity of these molecules
is enhanced by the isomerization reaction. This is explained by charge-transfer
processes, which make the anionic species a weaker base in the excited-state,
thereby stabilizing it.

6. The higher kESPT of CBCyP
is explained by the electron-withdrawing character of its substituents.
They should impair the back charge transfer from phenol to picolinium
(an essential step for the trans–cis isomerization), thereby
disrupting the latter reaction and blocking the reaction competing
with the ESPT reaction.



Time Sequence of Events
of PCyP in S1
In
the photoacid CBCyP (see Scheme 1c) with pKa* ≈ −7, the ESPT occurs
prior to solvation and half-twist of the cyanine bridge. The proton
transfer constant, τPT ≈ 170 fs.

In
the photoacid BCyP (see Scheme 1b) with pKa* ≈ −5, the solvation controls
the ESPT rate with τPT ≈ 2 ps.

In the
photoacid PCyP with pKa* ≈ −1.5, the ESPT
time constant is small and estimated to be τPT ≈
2 × 10–10 s–1.

The
time sequence of events for PCyP in the S1 state
based on the TD-DFT calculations and the low quantum yield of the
ESPT process (based on Figure 6) is as follows:1. Solvation in H2O takes place
on 1 ps time-scale.

2. Half-twist from ∼180° to
72° takes place on the same time-scale.

3. nonradiative S1 →
S0 at 72° takes place (see Figure 2) in about 10–11 s.

4. The large reduction in
the oscillator
strength at 72° should take place within 1 ps.

5. From the quantum yield of the ESPT
(see Figure 6), the
ESPT time constant is estimated to be 2 × 10–10 s–1.



Scheme 2 shows schematically
the major events of PCyP in the first excited singlet state.

Scheme 2 Schematic
Depiction of the Photoprotolytic Cycle of PCyP
CBCyP Computation
The data regarding
the charge-transfer
reorganization associated with the trans–cis isomerization
enable us to explain why CBCyP has a high kESPT (∼6.2 × 1012 s–1), as opposed
to PCyP (<1011 s–1). The structural
difference between CBCyP and PCyP is the presence of two electron-withdrawing
substituents (chlorine and an acetoxy group) in the phenol moiety
of the former molecule, which is expected to decrease the electron
density of the phenol. According the charge density measured for PCyP
(Figure 14A), the
S1 trans–cis isomerization is initiated by transfer
of negative charge from picolinium to phenol, which leads to a continuous
increase in energy until the activation barrier is reached (Figure 12A). This step should
be favored for CBCyP, given the electron-depleted character of its
phenol moiety because of the electron-withdrawing character of its
substituents. However, the next step in the S1 trans–cis
isomerization is charge transfer from phenol to the picolinium moiety,
which leads to a continuous decrease in energy until the S1 energy minimum is reached. Because of the expected electron-depleted
nature of the phenol moiety, this charge-transfer step should not
be very efficient, a fact which prevents reaching the S1 minimum. Thus, the electron-withdrawing substituents present in
the phenol of CBCyP are expected to disrupt the S1 trans–cis
isomerization reaction and so block the pathway competing with the
ESPT reaction. As a result of the limited competition provided by
the trans–cis isomerization, the kESPT for CBCyP is expected to increase.

The presence of these electron-withdrawing
substituents on the phenol moiety of CBCyP should also increase the kESPT by affecting the ESPT reaction directly.
As already noted, the enhanced photoacidity results from photoinduced
charge transfer that stabilizes the anionic (RO–) form in the excited state make it a weaker base.11,42 This is achieved by delocalizing the negative charge from the phenolate
moiety to the remaining molecule. By introducing electron-withdrawing
substituents to the phenol moiety of CBCyP, the electron density of
the phenolate moiety is decreased and delocalized throughout the molecule,
thereby stabilizing the anion in the S1 state.

Summary
and Conclusions
In this work, we studied the photoprotolytic
properties of a newly
synthesized photoacid, the PCyP salt, shown in Scheme 1a. We used steady-state and time-resolved
fluorescence techniques in this study. When the ground-state ROH form
is excited by light at ∼380 nm (the ROH absorption-band peak),
the steady-state fluorescence spectrum of PCyP consists of a strong
band of the ROH form and a much weaker band of the RO– form. The RO– fluorescence is also weak when the
RO– form of the PCyP is directly excited in basic
solution (pH > pKa). We find that the
fluorescence of the ROH is about five times stronger than that of
the RO– band when the ROH is excited at pH <
pKa. We therefore conclude that the nonradiative
rate constant of the ROH form is about five times that of the ESPT
process.

The time-resolved fluorescence shown in Figure 2 shows that the signal shape
is wavelength-dependent.
The shorter the monitored wavelength, the shorter the average lifetime
given by . The decay of the signal is nonexponential
within the ROH-band wavelength range of 470 < λ < 560
nm. We explain the wavelength dependence of the signal’s shape
by a large TD red band shift. This red shift is due to an excited-state
solvation process and trans–cis isomerization that leads to
a nonradiative process. During these two processes, the transition
dipole moment, S1 → S0, decreases and
the fluorescence intensity decreases. The ESPT rate constant for the
PCyP photoacid is smaller than the nonradiative rate, and therefore,
the efficiency of the ESPT process is rather low. We estimate that
the ESPT rate is smaller than the nonradiative rate by a factor of
five, and therefore, the time-resolved signals of the ROH form mimic
the red band shift and the trans–cis isomerization and not
the ESPT process.

In this article, we also compare the photoprotolytic
rates of the
PCyP with two other analog compounds, also shown in Scheme 1: the phenol BCyP and the chlorobenzoate
cyanine picolinium (CBCyP). The CBCyP compound is a very strong photoacid
with a pKa* of −6.5 and kESPT ≈ 6 × 1012 s–1 and τESPT ≈ 170 fs. The time-resolved fluorescence
signals are almost identical at all wavelengths of the ROH bands.
This is because the ESPT rate is higher than the solvation and the
trans–cis processes. The BCyP compound has a smaller ESPT rate
constant of about 0.5 × 1012 s–1. The ESPT rate is controlled by the solvation dynamics. Therefore,
the time-resolved fluorescence is wavelength-dependent because the
ESPT process is controlled by the solvation dynamics.

Materials and
Methods
Syntheses and General Techniques
The syntheses of the
three PCyP salts are described in the Supporting Information section.

Spectroscopy
Fresh solutions of
PCyP were used in all
measurements. HPLC-grade or analytical-grade solvents were used in
this study. All solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
as received.

The time-resolved fluorescence was measured by
the upconversion technique. The fluorescence of PCyP shown in Scheme 1 was studied in H2O and in D2O at room temperature. The laser used
for the fluorescence upconversion was a cavity-dumped Ti:sapphire
femtosecond laser (Mira, Coherent), which provides short, 120 fs,
pulses at about 800 nm. The cavity dumper operated with the low repetition
rate of 800 kHz. The upconversion system is a commercial system (FOG-100,
CDP, Russia). The samples were excited by second-harmonic-generation
pulses of ∼8 mW at wavelengths of 390–420 nm on average.
The time response of the upconversion system is determined by the
Raman–Stokes line of water, red-shifted by 3600 cm–1. We found that the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the signal
is 280 fs and the time resolution is about 100 fs. To avoid photodegradation,
samples were placed in a rotating optical cell and rotated at a frequency
of 10 Hz. Sample degradation was minimal and did not affect the profile
of the signal decay.

For the TCSPC measurements, we used, for
sample excitation, the
same laser as was used for the fluorescence upconversion system. The
TCSPC detection system was based on a Hamamatsu 3809U multichannel
plate photomultiplier and an Edinburgh Instruments TCC 900 integrated
TCSPC system. The time response of the instrument was approximately
40 ps fwhm. The excitation-pulse energy was reduced by neutral-density
filters to about 10 pJ. Experiments were carried out on solutions
at concentrations of about 0.5 mM.

The steady-state fluorescence
and excitation spectra were measured
by a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-3 fluorescence spectrofluorometer.

QM Computational Methods
All calculations were made
with the Gaussian 09 program package.43 Geometry optimizations and vibrational calculations were made at
the ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.44 The trans–cis isomerization reaction was modeled by performing
a relaxed PES scan, with geometry optimization at each point. This
PES scan was also performed at the ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p) level
of theory.

The energies of the ground state (S0)
were corrected by performing single-point energy calculations at the
ωB97XD/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory. The PES of the first singlet
excited state (S1) was evaluated by constructing the respective
Franck–Condon curves. These are constructed by obtaining the
TD45 ωB97XD/6-311+G(2d,p) vertical
excitation energies at the respective S0 structures. The
validity of constructing Franck–Condon curves arises from the
idea that the absorption process can provide valuable insight into
the fluorescent properties of a molecule. It should be noted that
the absorption spectrum often reflects the main features of the emissive
state, differing only by a red shift that occurs as a result of geometrical
relaxation of the molecule,46−48 and so, this approach has been
used routinely, with good results in the study of photochemical reactions.49−54

All optimization, frequency, and PES scan calculations were
performed
in implicit water, which was modeled by the use of the integral equation
formalism implicit solvation model (IEFPCM).55 ωB97XD is a long-range-corrected functional and was chosen
because of good results in local n → π*, π →
π*, charge-transfer, and Rydberg states.56

Closed-shell systems were treated with a restricted
(R) approach,
whereas open-shell systems were treated with an unrestricted (U) approach
and broken-symmetry technology (which mixes the highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital).
