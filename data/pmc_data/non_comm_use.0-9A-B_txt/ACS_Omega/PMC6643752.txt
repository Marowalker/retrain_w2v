In this work, an in situ SiO2 passivation technique
using atomic layer deposition (ALD) during the growth of gate dielectric
TaSiOx on solid-source molecular beam
epitaxy grown (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs on InP substrates is reported.
X-ray reciprocal space mapping demonstrated quasi-lattice matched
InxGa1–xAs epitaxy on crystallographically oriented InP substrates. Cross-sectional
transmission electron microscopy revealed sharp heterointerfaces between
ALD TaSiOx and (100) and (110)InxGa1–xAs epilayers,
wherein the presence of a consistent growth of an ∼0.8 nm intentionally
formed SiO2 interfacial passivating layer (IPL) is also
observed on each of (100) and (110)InxGa1–xAs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) revealed the incorporation of SiO2 in the composite
TaSiOx, and valence band offset (ΔEV) values for TaSiOx relative to (100) and (110)InxGa1–xAs orientations of 2.52 ± 0.05
and 2.65 ± 0.05 eV, respectively, were extracted. The conduction
band offset (ΔEC) was calculated
to be 1.3 ± 0.1 eV for (100)InxGa1–xAs and 1.43 ± 0.1 eV for (110)InxGa1–xAs,
using TaSiOx band gap values of 4.60 and
4.82 eV, respectively, determined from the fitted O 1s XPS loss spectra,
and the literature-reported composition-dependent InxGa1–xAs band gap. The in
situ passivation of InxGa1–xAs using SiO2 IPL during ALD of TaSiOx and the relatively large ΔEV and ΔEC values
reported in this work are expected to aid in the future development
of thermodynamically stable high-κ gate dielectrics on InxGa1–xAs
with reduced gate leakage, particularly under low-power device operation.

Introduction
High
mobility channel materials, e.g., InxGa1–xAs and Ge, coupled
with metal-gate/high-κ dielectric gate structures and multigate
transistor architectures were considered as an option for continued
transistor scaling and the enhanced performance for high-speed electronics.1 The rationale for using low band gap InxGa1–xAs (0.53
≤ x ≤ 1.0) is its superior electron
mobility (μn), allowing for higher transistor drive
current (ION) at lower operating voltages
during n-channel field-effect transistors (FETs) operation.2−6 Furthermore, the μn of InxGa1–xAs epilayers has been
demonstrated to be dependent on the epilayer’s crystallographic
orientation.7,8 Additionally, high-κ gate
dielectric/semiconductor heterointerface engineering approaches have
been adopted to passivate surface dangling bonds at the dielectric/semiconductor
heterointerface by forming an in situ or ex situ interface passivating
layer (IPL) to achieve high interfacial quality and superior gate
electrostatics with interface defect densities, Dit, as low as ∼4 × 1011 cm–2 eV–1. This approach has been successfully
demonstrated using atomic layer deposited amorphous TaSiOx on (i) InP/InGaAs/InAlAs quantum well FETs,3 (ii) InGaAs FinFETs,4,5 and
(iii) GaAsSb/InGaAs tunnel FETs.9,10 Moreover, successful
integration of high-κ dielectrics, for example., Al2O3,11−13 HfO214 and
TaSiOx3−5,15−18 on crystallographically oriented (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs would
aid in paving the way for InxGa1–xAs FinFET adoption, of which a representative device
architecture is shown in Figure 1.

Although atomic layer deposited
TaSiOx high-κ dielectric layers
have been investigated on the (100)InxGa1–xAs/InP
system,3−5 the majority of the reported work has utilized chlorine
(Cl)-based precursors, namely TaCl5 and SiCl415−19 wherein the reaction byproducts formed during the process can have
a detrimental impact on the dielectric quality, including but not
limited to thickness nonuniformity and nonideal oxide stoichiometry
(i.e., oxide charge).18 To circumvent these
issues, we propose the adoption of Cl-free precursors, such as tantalum(V)
ethoxide (Ta2(OC2H5)10) and tris(tert-butoxy)silanol (Si(OH)(OC(CH3)3)3), for the atomic layer deposition
(ALD) of TaSiOx. These two precursors
were used by Kukli et al.20 and Gordon
et al.21 for the deposition of tantalum
oxide and metal silicates/oxides for gate dielectrics, respectively.
During the hafnium silicate ALD process using tris(tert-butoxy)silanol precursor, Gordon et al.21 demonstrated an abrupt and smooth 1 nm SiO2 layer at
the interface of silicon substrate and the hafnium silicate. In addition,
tunable thicknesses of metal silicate and metal oxide films in the
range of 0.1–0.15 nm and 0.3–0.7 nm, respectively, per
cycle were demonstrated.21 In this work,
the in situ formation of an SiO2 passivating layer at the
amorphous TaSiOx and crystallographically
oriented InGaAs heterointerfaces can be achieved, using the experimental
methodologies outlined in refs,20,21 because
the 1 nm SiO2 layer was demonstrated per cycle21 during the deposition of hafnium silicate using
the tris(tert-butoxy)silanol precursor on Si. The
adoption of Cl-free precursors will avoid the detrimental formation
of HCl during deposition, thereby negating both Cl contamination and
incidental oxide etch during TaSiOx film
growth. For this work, crystallographically oriented epitaxial (100)InGaAs
and (110)InGaAs layers were achieved via the solid source molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) growth process, and the detailed material analysis
was evaluated through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, atomic
force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
The growth of interfacial SiO2 and TaSiOx was achieved using ALD, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was employed to study the chemical nature, as well as the band
alignment properties at the dielectric/InGaAs heterointerface. As
revealed by TEM micrographs, a consistent thickness of ∼0.8
nm intentionally formed SiO2 IPL was successfully achieved
on each of (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs. Demonstrated experimental results
of ALD amorphous TaSiOx on (100)InxGa1–xAs
and (110)InxGa1–xAs films with the in situ SiO2 passivating layer
are important for achieving low gate leakage metal–oxide–semiconductor
(MOS) devices.

Results and Discussion
Materials Analysis
Figure 2 shows the
crystallographically oriented,
beryllium (Be)-doped p-type (100)InGaAs and (110)InGaAs epitaxial
structures used in this work. During growth, in situ reflection high-energy
electron diffraction (RHEED) images were recorded in order to determine
the surface reconstruction and qualitatively assess surface morphology
at the growth front. Figure 3 shows the RHEED images from the surface of the (100)InxGa1–xAs
and (110)InxGa1–xAs epilayers, revealing (2 × diffused-4)-fold and (1 ×
diffused-4)-fold surface reconstructions, respectively. Typically,
a 4-fold surface reconstruction is not well-defined under arsenic-stabilized
growth conditions,22 whereas sharp and
luminous 4-fold surface reconstructions are readily apparent under
metal-stabilized growth conditions (i.e., utilizing an excessively
high growth temperature or insufficient As2 flux). It has
been reported that (110)InxGa1–xAs epilayers exhibit streaky (1 × 1)-fold RHEED
patterns when grown at a lower growth temperature of 280 °C,8 qualitatively different to the results observed
here. We note that (1 × 1) surfaces, e.g., (100)Si, are ideal
reconstructions typically unobserved on (100)-oriented III–V
materials because of a nonuniform surface charge distribution (i.e.,
a polar surface); however, due to the nonpolar nature of (110)-oriented
III–V surfaces, one could reasonably expect a lower-order,
e.g., (1 × 1), surface reconstruction. Consequently, we attribute
the observed difference in (110)InxGa1–xAs surface reconstruction to the
increased growth temperature, which entails increased surface energy
and a resulting change in the dimerization processes underlying surface
reconstruction.23 That said, the distinctly
sharp and luminous RHEED patterns observed from the surface of the
InxGa1–xAs epilayers investigated herein demonstrate coherent two-dimensional
epitaxy, which will be further evaluated by way of AFM and TEM in
subsequent sections.

p-type InxGa1–xAs layers on InP substrates. The (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs
layers were grown at 530 and 450 °C, respectively. In addition,
1.5 and 5 nm amorphous TaSiOx layers were
deposited to characterize the interface and band alignment properties.

Figure 3 RHEED patterns from the surface of the (100)InxGa1–xAs
and (110)InxGa1–xAs
epilayers were recorded during growth, exhibiting (2 × diffused-4)
and (1 × diffused-4) surface reconstructions, respectively.

Surface Morphology via
AFM
Demonstration of smooth
surface morphology provides a key indicator for the quality of the
as-grown materials, particularly so for (110)InxGa1–xAs epilayers because
of their tendency to exhibit crystallographically faceted surfaces
during and after growth.8,24−26 It has been reported that lower growth temperatures (e.g., 280 °C)
are needed to achieve smooth surface morphologies for (110)InxGa1–xAs
epitaxially grown on (110)InP substrates.8 However, a balance must be maintained between the growth temperature,
V/III ratio, and growth rate during growth of (110)InxGa1–xAs in order
to achieve smooth surface morphologies and superior electrical transport
and optical properties.8Figure 4a,b shows the 20 μm ×
20 μm AFM micrographs of the (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs surfaces,
respectively. The smooth surface morphology of the (100)InxGa1–xAs/InP structure
indicates lattice-matched or closely lattice-matched growth having
a root mean square (rms) roughness of 0.28 nm, in contrast to the
7.34 nm rms roughness of the (110)InxGa1–xAs structure. This can be attributed
to the high growth temperature employed for the (110)InxGa1–xAs/InP structure,
relative to the crystallographic orientation. As reported by Yerino
et al.,8 reduced growth temperatures would
limit the surface mobility of adatoms, thereby reducing the likelihood
of hillock formation and lowering overall surface roughness. Moreover,
Yerino et al. established a complex interdependence between the morphological
and optical properties and Hall mobility as a function of growth temperature
and the V/III ratio.8 Although a lower
growth temperature and higher V/III ratio are needed to achieve a
smooth surface morphology, the lower growth temperature promotes point
defects.8 Thus, a higher growth temperature
is desirable in order to mitigate the point defects at the cost of
the formation of hillocks and roughness. In this work, no attempt
has been made to optimize the surface morphology as a function of
growth parameters.

Figure 4 Surface morphology of the crystallographically oriented
InxGa1–xAs
layers grown on InP substrates. The measured surface roughnesses were
0.28 nm and 7.34 nm for the (100) and (110)InxGa1–xAs surfaces, respectively.

Compositional and Crystallinity
Analysis via X-ray
Symmetric (004) and asymmetric (115) reciprocal
space maps (RSMs)
were recorded from the (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs epilayers in order
to determine their degree of relaxation and In composition. Figure 5a,b shows the (115)
RSMs from the (100)InxGa1–xAs/InP and (110)InxGa1–xAs/InP heterostructures, respectively.
The reciprocal lattice points (RLP) of the InxGa1–xAs epilayer and the
InP substrate are noted in each figure. Examination of Figure 5a reveals that the In composition
of the (100)InxGa1–xAs epilayer was less than 53%, as indicated by the
elevated (100)InxGa1–xAs Qz position with respect
to the (100)InP substrate. We note that the peak separation between
InxGa1–xAs and InP RLP centroids is a rapid qualitative assessment of the
degree of lattice mismatch (and thus In composition), wherein higher
Qz corresponds to a lower lattice constant
epilayer (lower In composition) and vice versa. Using both the (004)
(not shown here) and (115) RSMs, the In compositions of the (100)InxGa1–xAs
and (110)InxGa1–xAs epilayers were found to be ∼49 and ∼53%, respectively.
Additional cross-sectional TEM analysis will aid in identifying the
effect on the structural properties, if any, of the lattice-mismatch
in the (100)InxGa1–xAs/InP structure, and if there was any quantifiable
crystallographic faceting during (110)InxGa1–xAs growth.

nature.

Surface Treatment of (100)InGaAs
via NH4OH and (NH4)2S
Surface
precleaning is necessary to
remove deleterious native oxides from the InGaAs surface prior to
the deposition of ALD TaSiOx. In order
to confirm this, we have studied the impact of (i) NH4OH
and (ii) (NH4)2S precleaning procedures and
compared the results with Ar+-sputtered (100)InGaAs surfaces
prepared in vacuo. Figure 6a–c shows the binding energy (BE) peak evolution of
the In 3d, Ga 2p, and As 3d core levels (CLs) from the surface of
a (100)InGaAs epilayer with the above stated surface treatments, as
recorded via XPS. The as-grown (100)InGaAs surface was sputtered using
low-energy Ar+ ions for 2 min under vacuum to remove residual
native oxides and thus, it can be directly compared to the surfaces
following the precleaning procedures defined earlier. We note that
1.5 nm Al2O3 was subsequently deposited after
each surface treatment in order to encapsulate the treated InGaAs
surface and prevent reoxidation while transporting the samples to
the XPS analysis chamber. From Figure 6c, one can find that (NH4)2S
effectively removed all native oxide species from the In0.49Ga0.51As surface without additional native oxide regrowth
during the subsequent ALD of Al2O3. Likewise,
the NH4OH surface treatment was similarly observed to remove
all Ga, As, and In native oxide species from the In0.49Ga0.51As surface without additional native oxide regrowth
during subsequent ALD Al2O3. On the basis of
our previous (NH4)2S surface passivation results
on GaAsSb,27 the additional small peak
observed in the Ga 2p CL spectra is likely asymmetry introduced by
low signal and high noise levels. Consequently, all investigated surface
treatments (i.e., NH4OH and (NH4)2S) show promise for the removal of native oxides prior to the deposition
of the intended TaSiOx dielectric.

Si Incorporation in Ta2O5 via Si/Ta Super-Cycles
for TaSiOx
Prior to the deposition
of TaSiOx dielectric layer, Si and Ta
pulse switching sequence was established during the thermal ALD process,
in order to achieve targeted Si composition of approximately 20% in
TaSiOx. Figure 7a shows the Si/Ta super-cycle sequence used
during the thermal ALD of TaSiOx (∼20%
Si, as determined via variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and
XPS) on (100)InGaAs and (110)InGaAs. Prepulsing of ((CH3)3CO)3SiOH was implemented prior to the first
Ta2(OC2H5)10 subcycle
in order to intentionally form a thermodynamically stable interfacial
SiOx region that would prevent reoxidation
of the InGaAs surface. In this work, a 1:6 Si/Ta super-cycle was used
in order to incorporate approximately 20% Si into the (Ta2O5)1–x(SiO2)x layer. To verify the incorporation
of Si into the composite dielectric, XPS measurements were performed,
wherein Figure 7b shows
representative the TaSiOx surface survey
spectra as a function of InGaAs surface orientation. One can find
that the Si 2s and 2p BE peaks, located between 100 and 200 eV, correspond
to the Si–O bonding environment, indicating the successful
incorporation of SiO2 into the composite (Ta2O5)1–x(SiO2)x dielectric. Cross-sectional TEM analysis
would then further confirm the formation of an SiO2 IPL,
the heterointerface abruptness between TaSiOx and InGaAs as well as between TaSiOx and the IPL, and the thickness of the TaSiOx dielectric.

Figure 7 (a) Representative ALD super cycle during TaSiOx deposition, and (b) XPS surface spectra from TaSiOx on (100) and (110)InxGa1–xAs. The positions of
the
Si 2s and 2p peaks indicate the incorporation of SiO2 within
the composite dielectric.

TaSiOx/InGaAs Heterointerface Abruptness
via TEM
Figures 8a–d and 9a–d show cross-sectional
TEM micrographs of TaSiOx deposited on
(100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs, respectively, showing the entire heterostructure
and each heterointerface of interest. One can find from Figure 8a that a dislocated region
extending ∼150 nm in the growth direction exists because of
the unintentional lattice mismatch at the (100)InxGa1–xAs/InP heterointerface,
supporting the reduced In composition (and thus lattice constant)
identified via XRD analysis (see Figure 5). Figure 8b–d shows the heterointerface between the TaSiOx and (100)InxGa1–xAs epilayer, including the
intentionally formed SiO2 interface layer, with increasing
magnification. Similarly, Figure 9a–d shows the heterointerface between TaSiOx and (110)InxGa1–xAs under increasing magnification.
In both cases, we note that target TaSiOx thickness was approximately 5 nm. From Figures 8d and 9d, one can
find a sharp interface between the intentionally formed SiO2 interlayer (and overlying TaSiOx dielectric)
and the crystallographically oriented InxGa1–xAs epilayers. The previously
discussed single SiO2 full-cycle (see Figure 7a) was found to contribute
to the growth of an approximately 8 Å interfacial SiO2 layer, which is in agreement with the work reported in ref (21). Given the unusually high
single-cycle growth rate observed, particularly given the low deposition
rate of tris(tert-butoxy)silanol (TBOS)/H2O-based ALD reactions, the potential for a catalytic growth reaction
between the Ta and Si precursors cannot be excluded. Nevertheless,
the presence of such a thin SiO2 would be expected to aid
in the passivation of electrically active defect states at the III/V
oxide interface and provide a thermodynamically stable barrier layer.

TaSiOx/InGaAs
Heterointerface Band
Alignment via XPS
In order to determine the electronic band
structure at the TaSiOx/InxGa1–xAs heterointerface,
XPS spectra were recorded for each orientation utilizing three distinct
sample types: (i) 1.5 nm TaSiOx/1 μm
InxGa1–xAs; (ii) 5 nm TaSiOx/1 μm InGaAs;
and (iii) 1 μm InGaAs without the overlying TaSiOx. The valence band offset (ΔEv) can then be defined as28 1  where,  and  are the Ta 4f7/2 and As 3d5/2 CL binding energies from the 5 nm, bulk-like TaSiOx (sample (ii)) and 1 μm InxGa1–xAs without
the overlying TaSiOx (sample (iii)), respectively. EVBM is the valence band maxima (VBM) of the
respective bulk-like materials (samples (ii) and (iii)), and is determined
by the linear extrapolation of the leading edge of the valence band
spectra to the spectral base line.29 We
note that an accurate determination of the VBM value of each material
is critical for the measurement of valence band offsets. According
to Kraut’s method,28 the VBM can
be determined by fitting an instrumentally broadened valence band
density of states (DOS), for which the VBM is uniquely identified
as the energy at which the DOS goes to zero, thereby allowing the
extraction by linear extrapolation of the VBM from the experimental
onset of photoemission.28−30 ΔECL =  is extracted from the XPS spectra at the
TaSiOx/InxGa1–xAs interface, i.e., sample
(i). Similarly, the TaSiOx band gap can
be extracted via the linear extrapolation of the onset (threshold)
of the energy loss spectrum, relative in this case to the O 1s spectrum,
corresponding to electronic excitations because of inelastic losses
during band-to-band transitions in thin oxide films. This has been
demonstrated to be quantifiable from photoemission spectra, appearing
in the higher kinetic energy range of primary CLs (i.e., O 1s photoelectrons).31,32 Having determined the interfacial ΔEV and bulk-like TaSiOx band gap,
the conduction band offset (ΔEc)
can be estimated using eq 2 to obtain the complete band alignment at the TaSiOx/InxGa1–xAs heterointerface 2  

Figure 10a–c show the CL and
valence band
spectra from each of the aforementioned samples for the epitaxially
grown (100)InxGa1–xAs orientation. Figure 10a shows the BE information for the (i) Ta
4f CL and VBM spectra of bulk-like TaSiOx, where the Ta 4f7/2 CL is fitted to the 5+ oxidation state, which is its most stable form.33,34Figure 10a also
depicts the BE information of the (ii) As 3d CL and VBM spectra for
bulk InxGa1–xAs, and (iii) the BE information of the Ta 4f and As 3d CLs
at the interface between TaSiOx and (100)InxGa1–xAs.
All measured binding energies are summarized in Table 1. The values for ,  and ΔECL were determined to be
24.39, 40.82, and −13.91, respectively.
Thus, the resulting ΔEv between
TaSiOx and (100)InxGa1–xAs was determined to
be −2.52 ± 0.05 eV using eq 1. An uncertainty of 0.05 eV arises from the selection
of data points over the linear region when fitting the VBM data. Figure 10b shows the O 1s
spectra used to fit the band gap of the TaSiOx thin film. The resulting band gap, extracted as the onset
of the energy loss spectrum relative to the O 1s peak, was determined
to be ∼4.60 eV. ΔEC was then
calculated to be 1.3 ± 0.1 eV using eq 2 and taking into consideration the alloy composition
of InxGa1–xAs to determine its corresponding band gap energy. Figure 10c schematically
represents the resulting band alignment at the TaSiOx/(100)InxGa1–xAs heterointerface in accordance with the values
summarized in Table 1.

Lastly, Figure 11a–c shows the CL and

the aforementioned samples for the epitaxially grown (110)InxGa1–xAs orientation. Figure 11a shows the BE
information of the (i) Ta 4f CL and VBM spectra of bulk-like TaSiOx. Also shown are the BE information for the
(ii) As 3d CL and VBM spectra for (110)InxGa1–xAs, and (iii) Ta 4f and As
3d CLs at the TaSiOx/(110)InxGa1–xAs interface.
As before, all measured binding energies are also summarized in Table 1. Following the XPS
measurements for the (110)InxGa1–xAs/InP orientation, the values for ,  and ΔECL were determined to be
24.16, 40.88, and −14.06 eV, respectively.
Thus, the resulting ΔEv of TaSiOx relative to (110)InxGa1–xAs was determined to
be −2.65 ± 0.05 eV using eq 1, which was larger than the observed ΔEv for the (100)InxGa1–xAs orientation. Figure 11b depicts the O
1s spectra used to fit the band gap of the TaSiOx film, found to be ∼4.82 eV, which was also larger than
the observed TaSiOx band gap for the (100)InxGa1–xAs
orientation, potentially implying an increase in Si (SiO2, χ = 0.9 eV)35 incorporation within
Ta2O5 for (110) oriented films. ΔEc was determined to be 1.43 ± 0.1 eV using eq 2 taking into consideration
the compositionally dependent and measured InxGa1–xAs and TaSiOx band gaps, respectively. At a glance, SiO2, with its band gap of ∼9 eV, enhances the band gap of the
resulting (Ta2O5)1–x(SiO2)x composite dielectric
as a function of incorporation, thereby allowing for higher energy
band discontinuities and increased carrier confinement.15,16,36Figure 11c illustrates the resulting band alignment
of the TaSiOx/(110)InxGa1–xAs heterointerface
in accordance with the values summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions
Crystallographically
oriented epitaxial (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs
layers were grown on InP substrates using MBE and evaluated for their
structural and band alignment properties. X-ray analysis revealed
the quasi-lattice-matched composition of the InxGa1–xAs epilayers, as further
corroborated by TEM analysis. Cross-sectional TEM micrographs revealed
abrupt heterointerfaces between the atomic layer deposited TaSiOx and InxGa1–xAs epilayers, essential for reducing
interface scattering and increasing carrier mobility in InxGa1–xAs transistors.
Moreover, TEM analysis identified the presence of an (intentionally
grown) SiO2 interlayer at the TaSiOx/InxGa1–xAs interface, which could aid in the passivation of electrically
active interface defect states. Valence and conduction band offsets
between TaSiOx and InxGa1–xAs were determined
to be greater than 1.0 eV, a necessary component of gate leakage suppression
in TaSiOx/InxGa1–xAs MOS structures. Thus,
these results provide guidance for the integration of TaSiOx-based high-κ gate dielectrics with InxGa1–xAs
MOS devices in future FET applications.

Experimental Section
Material
Synthesis
Crystallographically oriented p-type
Be-doped 1 μm thick InxGa1–xAs (0.49 ≤ x ≤ 0.53)
layers were grown on epi-ready (100)InP and (110)InP substrates via
solid source MBE. InP oxide desorption was performed using an arsenic
over pressure of ∼10–5 Torr at 575 and 550
°C for (100)InP and (110)InP, respectively, noting that the temperatures
referred to throughout this work are the thermocouple temperatures.
During oxide desorption and each InxGa1–xAs epilayer growth, in situ RHEED
was used to monitor the sample surface. The growth temperature and
the As2/(In + Ga) flux ratios were 530 °C/450 °C
and 30/32 for the (100)InxGa1–xAs/(110)InxGa1–xAs samples, respectively. The reduction in growth
temperature between (100) and (110) orientations was a necessary step
in order to reduce the magnitude of crystallographic faceting on the
sample surface during growth. Following each growth, the substrate
temperature was reduced to 275 °C under a gradually reducing
As2 over pressure, then further decreased to 150 °C
for sample retrieval.

Materials Characterization
Each
sample was characterized
using AFM for surface morphology, high-resolution XRD for In composition
and epilayer crystallinity, and cross-sectional TEM to elucidate the
interfacial properties at the oxide/InxGa1–xAs interface. Cross-sectional
TEM samples were prepared using conventional sample preparation methods,
i.e.: mechanical polishing, dimpling, and Ar+ ion milling
at low temperature. Band offsets between the ALD TaSiOx and each crystallographically oriented InxGa1–xAs epilayer
were determined using a Phi Quantera scanning XPS microprobe instrument
with a monochromatic Al Kα (beam energy of 1486.7 eV) X-ray
source. During XPS measurements, a constant flow of electrons were
maintained in order to neutralize positive charge accumulation on
the oxide surface. In addition, the band gap of TaSiOx on each crystallographically oriented InxGa1–xAs surface
was determined using O 1s loss spectra fitting. 1.5 nm TaSiOx/1 μm (100)InxGa1–xAs and (110)InxGa1–xAs samples were used
for the measurement of binding energies at the oxide/semiconductor
interface. Additionally, (i) 5 nm TaSiOx/1 μm InxGa1–xAs, and (ii) 1 μm InGaAs (i.e., without TaSiOx) were used to acquire BE data for bulk TaSiOx and InxGa1–xAs, respectively. The Ta 4f and
As 3d CL BE spectra, as well as the TaSiOx and InGaAs valence band BE spectra, were collected with a pass energy
of 26.0 eV and an exit angle of 45°. The binding energies were
corrected by adjusting the C 1s CL peak position to 285.0 eV for each
sample surface. Curve fitting was performed using CasaXPS v2.3.14
employing a Lorentzian convolution with a Shirley-type background.

During sample preparation, each InxGa1–xAs surface was degreased
using acetone, isopropanol, and deionized (DI) water in 60 s sequential
increments. After degreasing, samples were treated with 20% (NH4)2S for 10 min prior to TaSiOx ALD, wherein the sulfur passivation timing was selected based
on our previously-reported work on GaAsSb.27 5 and 1.5 nm TaSiOx thin films were
then deposited at 250 °C using a Cambridge NanoTech ALD system
with tantalum(V) ethoxide, TBOS, and DI water as precursors. An initial
TBOS/H2O full-cycle was used to prime the sample surface,
followed by 16/3 (Ta/Si) super-cycles for the 5 nm/1.5 nm TaSiOx, respectively, wherein each super-cycle
consisted of one SiO2 cycle for every six Ta2O5 cycles. The approximate growth rate used was 0.5 Å/cycle.
