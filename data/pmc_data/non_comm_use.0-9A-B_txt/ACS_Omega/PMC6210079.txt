Despite
the therapeutic promise of phospholipid-based nanocarriers,
a major obstacle to their widespread clinical translation is a susceptibility
to fatty acid ester hydrolysis, leading to lack of quality control
and inconsistencies in self-assembly formulations. Using electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry fragmentation in combination with matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we have
demonstrated a method to detect hydrolysis of one or both of the fatty
acid esters in a PEGylated phospholipid, DSPE-PEG, in conditions commonly
applied during nanocarrier production. Because such carriers are increasingly
being used to deliver peptide-based therapeutics, we further investigated
the hydrolysis of phospholipid esters in conditions used for solid-phase
peptide synthesis and high-performance liquid chromatography of peptides.
We ultimately detail a synthetic strategy to reliably produce pure
phospholipid–peptide bioconjugates (peptide amphiphiles), while
avoiding unintended or unnoticed hydrolyzed byproducts that could
lead to polymorphic nanotherapeutics with dampened therapeutic efficacy.
We believe that such an approach could help standardize phospholipid–peptide-based
therapeutic development, testing, and clinical translation.

1 Introduction
Peptides are increasingly
being used to fill a therapeutic gap
between small molecules and biologics, particularly for targeting
intracellular protein–protein interactions (PPIs).3 While only one small molecule drug and zero biologics
have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
for targeting intracellular PPIs,4 peptides
are entering clinical trials in increasing numbers every year, with
more than 100 currently under study.3,5 Peptides can
harness natural PPI specificity through mimicking a protein’s
amino acid sequence and secondary structure. Additionally, peptides
can possess the biodegradability and low toxicity associated with
biologics, while also having the potency and synthetic accessibility
typically associated with small molecules.6 Despite their promise, peptides face a number of obstacles to clinical
translation, including rapid clearance, low oral bioavailability,
cellular impermeability, and metabolic instability.5,6 Phospholipid-based
nanocarriers are one approach being used to overcome these obstacles.1,2

Phospholipid–peptide conjugation to form peptide amphiphiles
(PAs) can improve the pharmacologic potential of peptide drugs that
would otherwise be clinically unsuccessful, as phospholipids are biocompatible,
drive nanoparticle self-assembly, can be modified with functional
elements (i.e., therapeutic, diagnostic, or targeting), promote cellular
internalization, and extend the circulation half-lives of drugs.1,,−14 Chemical functionalization and purification of phospholipids with
peptides, however, exposes them to conditions that can lead to lipid
hydrolysis. Hydrolysis byproducts can significantly affect the structure
and properties of these nanostructures.7,8,10−12,14−17 Consequently, one of the main obstacles to clinical translation
of lipid-based nanocarriers, as recently highlighted by the U.S. FDA,
is quality assurance and consistency in self-assembly formulations,
particularly as it relates to hydrolysis.18−24

Despite the risks for hydrolysis, there are many examples
of lipopeptide
synthesis using potentially hydrolytic conditions without documentation
of a lack of ester hydrolysis byproducts at the end of synthesis and
purification. This can be particularly problematic when a polyethylene
glycol (PEG) domain is included in a peptide–lipid conjugate.
Here, the molecular weight (MW) becomes polydisperse, and side reactions,
including hydrolysis, are more difficult to detect with standard peptide
validation techniques such as liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry
(LC–MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF–MS), and amino acid analysis (AAA),
thereby ultimately limiting quality control.

During the synthesis
and purification of a PA nanoparticle containing
a p53-reactivating therapeutic peptide conjugated to a PEGylated phospholipid,
DSPE-PEG, we noticed an uncharacteristic MW signature and investigated
its cause and detection. In doing so, we (1) uncovered partial hydrolysis
of one or both of DSPE-PEG’s fatty acid esters in conditions
commonly applied to DSPE-PEG in the literature, (2) validated a detection
method using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS)
fragmentation, and (3) demonstrated a synthetic route to reliably
produce pure phospholipid–peptide bioconjugates (PAs) without
unintended or unnoticed hydrolysis byproducts that can possibly lead
to polymorphic nanotherapeutics with dampened efficacy.

2 Results and Discussion
We attempted to conjugate a therapeutic
peptide (p5314–29) to DSPE-PEG in an effort to form
p5314–29 PA
nanoparticles. The p5314–29 peptide, in its hydrocarbon
stapled form, is known to penetrate cells and reactivate cell death
through disruption of the interaction between WTp53 and its endogenous
inhibitors, MDM2 and MDM4.25,26 A PA consisting of
a ∼2200 Da peptide conjugated to polydisperse DSPE-PEG (∼3000
Da) should have MWs spanning approximately 4700–5700 Da with
an average of ∼5200 Da. MALDI-TOF–MS provided little
sensitivity to detect small changes in MW because of side reactions
for such polydisperse samples. However, during ESI–MS, the
dialkylglycerol portion of DSPE-PEG was artifactually cleaved from
the rest of the molecule to produce a prominent, monodisperse MW signature
at 607 Da (Figure 1). When purifying the PA via high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)–MS, we discovered a loss of the 607 Da ESI–MS
fragmentation peak and a novel 341 Da peak. This new peak corresponded
to an alkylglycerol fragment of DSPE-PEG missing one of its C18 fatty
acid tails because of ester hydrolysis (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Acid-catalyzed ester hydrolysis of DSPE-PEG
generates shifts in
MW signatures. Hydrolysis of one or both esters in DSPE-PEG generates
shifts in absolute MW, observable by MALDI-TOF MS, and in the MW of
an alkylglycerol ionization fragment, observable by ESI–MS.
Thereby, MALDI-TOF–MS was used to qualitatively measure shifts
in the average MW of polydisperse MW distributions, while ESI–MS
was used to detect the presence of the hydrolyzed alkylglycerol portion
of the molecule at 341 Da.

To determine which steps of PA manufacturing caused this
hydrolysis
byproduct, we exposed DSPE-PEG to chemical conditions commonly used
for PA synthesis and purification and monitored MW signatures simultaneously
using MALDI-TOF–MS and ESI–MS at relevant time points.
To avoid misleading artifactual fragmentation, MS techniques were
performed in parallel with different ionization modes (Figure 1). Our first goal in standardizing
the detection of hydrolyzed phospholipids was to establish an inert
solvent that could be used to prepare samples for both ESI–MS
and MALDI-TOF–MS without affecting DSPE-PEG. Methanol, a polar,
protic solvent but poor nucleophile, should not harm DSPE-PEG. To
test this, DSPE-PEG was dissolved in methanol and incubated at room
temperature (RT) for up to 72 h. MALDI-TOF–MS showed no observable
effect of methanol on DSPE-PEG at RT for at least 72 h, and the polydisperse
MW distribution remained centered around the expected average MW,
2867 Da (Figure 2a).
ESI–MS of these samples measured an m/z pattern reflective of intact DSPE-PEG, with polydisperse
MW distributions centered around m/3, m/4, and m/5, and a strong ionization
artifact peak at 607 Da corresponding to the existence of double-tailed
DSPE-PEG (Figure 2b).
Therefore, methanol had no effect on DSPE-PEG and was used during
MS characterization of all subsequent samples.

Figure 2 MALDI-TOF and ESI–MS
reveal phospholipid ester hydrolysis
when DSPE-PEG is exposed to a TFA cleavage cocktail used to remove
peptides from solid-phase support. (a,b) Esters of DSPE-PEG are stable
in methanol at RT. (a) MALDI-TOF shows a time-independent polymeric
MW distribution centered at the average MW of 2867 Da. (b) ESI–MS
spectra are also time-independent, showing a peak at 607 Da corresponding
to an intact dialkylglycerol portion of DSPE-PEG and polymeric distributions
centered around the expected values of m/3, m/4, and m/5. (c,d) After incubation with
a TFA cocktail commonly used to remove peptides from solid-phase support,
MALDI-TOF and ESI–MS both demonstrate leftward shifts in the
MW of DSPE-PEG, corresponding to ester hydrolysis. (c) MALDI-TOF shows
a leftward shift in the MW distribution of 266 Da per hydrolyzed ester,
as indicated by each red arrow. (d) In ESI–MS, the signature
ionization fragment at 607 Da shifts to 341 Da, corresponding to phosphodiester
fragmentation during ionization of the alkyl-glycerol portion of DSPE-PEG
with only one fatty acid tail. In agreement with the MALDI-TOF data,
this hydrolyzed fragment appeared as early as 30 min of treatment,
with the signal increasing over 2 h.

Because peptides are commonly conjugated to lipids in an
increasing
variety of biotherapeutic applications, we next tested the compatibility
of DSPE-PEG with solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) conditions.
Following synthesis, peptides on resin are subjected to a trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) cleavage cocktail to remove them from solid-phase support
and deprotect their amino acid side chains. The removed side-chain
protecting groups generate highly reactive carbocations, necessitating
the presence of nucleophilic scavengers [e.g., water and triisopropylsilane
(TIS)]. Because this strong aqueous acid solution could theoretically
hydrolyze fatty acid esters within DSPE-PEG, we monitored DSPE-PEG
stability in a TFA cleavage cocktail for up to 2 h, the minimum length
of time generally used to remove peptides from resin at preparative
scales. MALDI-TOF spectra detected a MW distribution shifted to the
left by approximately 266 Da after 1 h, corresponding to the hydrolysis
of one stearic acid from DSPE-PEG (Figure 2c). The MW distribution continued to shift
leftward after 2 h of incubation, centering around an average MW corresponding
to the loss of two stearic acid molecules from DSPE-PEG. ESI–MS
confirmed fatty acid ester hydrolysis with a new peak appearing at
341 Da, corresponding to the hydrolyzed ionization fragment (Figure 2d). These results
demonstrate that DSPE-PEG is incompatible with solid phase conjugation
to peptides using commonly available acid-labile resins and side-chain
protecting groups. Fatty acid esters would also not be assumed to
be compatible with SPPS conditions.

One strategy to avoid this
obstacle to lipid-based peptide nanocarrier
synthesis is to exclude water and other nucleophiles from the TFA
cleavage cocktail.27 However, such a strategy
would generate a new risk of undesired side reactions between the
amino acid side chains and highly reactive carbocations generated
during amino acid deprotection. Another potential strategy is to identify
nucleophilic scavengers that react readily with carbocations but not
esters. However, this brings an increased risk of side reactions that
would be buried within the polydispersity of a PEGylated lipid’s
MW during standard LC–MS, MALDI-TOF–MS, and AAA validation.

Because water is a critical solvent commonly used for phospholipid
self-assembly, conjugation, and purification, we next tested the stability
of DSPE-PEG in de-ionized water and common buffers used for peptide
purification. The rate of phospholipid ester hydrolysis is minimized
at pH 6.5 and greatly accelerated at higher or lower pH.15,28,29 MALDI-TOF analysis of DSPE-PEG
dissolved in unbuffered, ultrapure Milli-Q water revealed a distribution
of MWs 532 Da smaller than DSPE-PEG after 72 h at RT, corresponding
to hydrolysis of both esters (Figure 3a). This was accelerated when samples were heated to
60 °C with a leftward shift appearing in the MALDI-TOF spectra
after only 2 h (Figure 3b). ESI–MS confirmed the presence of hydrolysis byproducts
after 2 h with a peak appearing at 341 Da (Figure 3c). Unbuffered water, therefore, is not sufficient
for preventing hydrolysis of phospholipid esters such as in DSPE-PEG.

Figure 3 Phospholipid
esters are hydrolyzed by unbuffered and acidic water,
and hydrolysis is accelerated by heat. (a–c) Esters of DSPE-PEG
are hydrolyzed in unbuffered water, and hydrolysis is accelerated
by heat. (a) DSPE-PEG dissolved in ultrapure Milli-Q water for 72
h at RT results in a leftward shift in MW on MALDI-TOF corresponding
to the loss of two stearic acid molecules (−266 Da per hydrolyzed
ester, as indicated by each red arrow). (b) Heating to 60 °C
accelerates this loss. (c) Analysis of the 2 h, 60 °C sample
using ESI–MS confirms hydrolysis with a shift of the signature
ionization fragment from 607 to 341 Da. (d–f) Acidic HPLC buffer
and heat each increase the rate of hydrolysis of the esters of DSPE-PEG.
(d) After DSPE-PEG was incubated in acidic HPLC buffer, MALDI-TOF
shows a leftward shift in MW corresponding to the loss of two stearic
acid molecules (−266 Da per hydrolyzed ester, as indicated
by each red arrow). (e) Identical sample was heated to 60 °C,
and hydrolysis was detectable as early as 30 min. (F) As confirmed
with ESI–MS, the signature ionization fragment of 607 Da shifts
to 341 Da.

Peptides carrying positive charges
are most often purified via
HPLC using acidic pH 2–3 buffer, imposing another obstacle
for purification of PA conjugates, as this acidic pH should accelerate
the rate of ester hydrolysis. To test this, we dissolved DSPE-PEG
in a commonly used HPLC buffer (water + 0.1% formic acid, pH 2.7)
at both RT and 60 °C. There was no detectable MW shift in MALDI-TOF
MS at RT for 2 h, but after 72 h the MW shifted to the left, corresponding
to hydrolysis of both fatty acid esters (Figures 1 and 3d). When DSPE-PEG
was heated to 60 °C in acidic HPLC buffer, MALDI-TOF revealed
a leftward shift starting as early as 30 min (Figure 3e). ESI–MS again confirmed the formation
of hydrolysis byproducts with the presence of an ionization fragment
at 341 Da (Figure 3f). In contrast, when DSPE-PEG was dissolved in pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) buffer, hydrolysis was absent at any time point or temperature,
as measured by MALDI-TOF and ESI–MS (Figure 4a–c). Therefore, while water and heat
are both risks for phospholipid ester hydrolysis, this possibility
can be mitigated during HPLC purification by using a neutral pH buffer,
lower temperatures, and/or shorter exposure times.

Figure 4 Esters of DSPE-PEG are
stable in neutral buffered PBS at RT and
60 °C. (a,b) MALDI-TOF MS shows no changes in the absolute MW
of DSPE-PEG after incubation in PBS at either (a) RT or (b) 60 °C
for at least 2 h (c) ESI–MS shows no detectable peaks at 341
Da, indicating no hydrolysis after 2 h in PBS at RT or 60 °C.

By avoiding the hydrolysis-inducing
conditions described above,
we generated a pure DSPE-PEG PA nanoparticle with the p5314–29 peptide conjugated to DSPE-PEG maleimide via an N-terminal thiol
linker. In summary, we cleaved the peptide from the resin before conjugating
the phospholipid to avoid exposing the esters to TFA. We then conjugated
DSPE-PEG to the peptide in neutral buffered aqueous solution. Lastly,
we avoided hydrolysis during HPLC purification by (1) avoiding high
temperatures, (2) buffering the fractions to neutral pH immediately
upon elution, and (3) rapidly removing the solvent by rotary evaporation
and lyophilization.

Following purification, LC–MS showed
only one peak with
UV absorbance at 280 nm, indicating a solitary pure product. Here,
the two intact lipid tails, rather than the polydisperse PEG, was
the predominant driver of the hydrophobic interaction between the
DSPE-PEG moieties and the LC column, as reflected in the elution of
single peak at ∼94% methanol. The corresponding ESI–MS
signal had a peak at 607 Da, indicating an intact DSPE-PEG tail with
no detectable hydrolysis fragments (Figure 5a). MALDI-TOF revealed a polydisperse MW
distribution centered around 5205 Da, the expected average MW of the
PA (Figure 5b). There
was also a second distribution of MWs that was smaller by 607 Da,
corresponding to the same artifactual fragmentation of DSPE-PEG’s
phosphodiester bond. Lastly, a closer inspection of the exact MWs
within the polydisperse distribution revealed an exact match to the
calculated MWs of this PA with 44, 45, or 46 PEG units, with the expected
spacing of 44 Da (Figure 5c). These PAs formed round, homogenous nanoparticle micelles
that were strikingly monodisperse, properties ideal for preclinical
testing and clinical translation (Figure 5d,e).

Figure 5 Buffered synthesis and purification conditions
generate pure DSPE-PEG-PAs
with no detectable hydrolysis byproducts. Peptide p5314–29 was synthesized with an N-terminal thiol linker using SPPS followed
by RP-HPLC purification. DSPE-PEG-maleimide was then conjugated using
neutral buffer, and the resulting PA was purified using mild RP-HPLC
conditions. (a) LCMS of the pure PA fractions shows one peak with
280 nm absorbance, and the corresponding ESI–MS signal at 607
Da confirms that it has an intact DSPE-PEG tail. (b) MALDI-TOF shows
a polydisperse MW distribution, centered at approximately 5205 Da,
the expected average MW of the PA. A secondary distribution is also
visible, approximately 607 Da smaller, corresponding to artifactual
fragmentation of the PA’s phosphodiester bond. (c) Zooming-in
on the MALDI-TOF spectrum reveals peaks matching the expected MWs
of PAs with 44, 45, or 46 PEG units. These peaks have the expected
PEG spacing of 44 Da, and their corresponding Na+ adducts
are also visible at +23 Da. (d) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
imaging reveals PA self-assembly into spherical micelles (115 000×
magnification). (e) Histogram of hydrodynamic radius from DLS measurements
shows a monodisperse size distribution with Dh = 12.94 nm and PDI = 0.19.

3 Conclusions
This study highlights the pH-
and temperature-dependence of phospholipid
ester hydrolysis, raising unique concerns for newly developed phospholipid–peptide
conjugates. Unlike SPPS for peptides, there are currently no universal
protocols for conjugating, purifying, or otherwise handling phospholipid-based
drug delivery systems, and many reports subject phospholipid esters
to conditions known to promote their hydrolysis without explicit documentation
of final product purity. This is the first report to our knowledge
showing the significant limitations that exist when employing widely
used peptide synthesis and purification workflows for phospholipids.
We believe that techniques such as those presented here should be
adapted, especially when a polydisperse polymer, such as PEG, is included
in a bioconjugate in advance of preclinical testing.

hexafluorophosphate (PyAOP) was purchased from EMD Millipore. 3-Tritylsulfanyl-propionic
acid (Mpa(Trt)-OH) was purchased from Bachem.

4.2 DSPE-PEG
Hydrolysis Tests
For each
solvent to be tested, 10 mg of DSPE-PEG was weighed into a 1.5 mL
Eppendorf tube and dissolved in 1 mL of solvent. The solution was
then split into two Eppendorf tubes, each 500 μL. One tube was
left at RT, and the other was incubated at 60 °C. At each measured
time point, 100 μL of each sample was transferred into a new
Eppendorf tube for solvent removal. For TFA and methanol samples,
the solvent was quickly evaporated under a gentle stream of blowing
nitrogen. For other aqueous solvents, the sample was rapidly frozen
in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized.

4.3 Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption/Ionization
Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry
Dried samples were dissolved
in 100 μL of methanol, plated with dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix,
and analyzed using the Bruker Ultraflextreme MALDI-TOF-TOF in the
University of Chicago’s Mass Spectrometry Core Facility. To
avoid fragmentation artifacts during ionization, the laser power was
set using pure DSPE-PEG dissolved in methanol to a level that allowed
for sufficient ionization without fragmentation artifacts. The same
laser power was then applied to all samples.

4.4 Electrospray
Ionization Mass Spectrometry
Dried samples were dissolved
in 100 μL of methanol for ESI–MS
via an Agilent 6130 LCMS. The ionization conditions were set using
pure DSPE-PEG dissolved in methanol to a level that allowed for sufficient
ionization without fragmentation artifacts. The same ionization conditions
were then applied to all samples. The mobile phase was 50% water +
0.1% formic acid, 50% methanol, with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The
MS signal was acquired in positive mode, and the settings in the Agilent
software were set as follows: fragmentor = 100, gain = 2.00, threshold
= 100, step size = 0.10.

4.5 Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis
The
p5314–29 peptide with N-terminal thiol and flexible
linker was synthesized with sequence MPA(bAla)GG(bAla)LSQETFSDLWKLLPEN-NH2.
The peptide was synthesized manually in a peptide synthesis vessel
from Chemglass using standard Fmoc SPPS protocols on Agilent AmphiSpheres
40 RAM resin. Before and after each reaction, the resin was washed
extensively with NMP and DCM. Fmoc deprotection was accomplished with
2 × 10 min reactions with 25% piperidine in NMP, and deprotection
was confirmed via the Kaiser Test. Each amino acid (10× with
respect to (w.r.t.) resin substitution) and PyAOP (10× w.r.t.
resin substitution) were dissolved in NMP immediately before use and
activated by DIPEA (20× w.r.t. resin substitution) immediately
before addition to the reaction vessel. Coupling was allowed to proceed
until the Kaiser Test was clear. After each coupling, a capping solution
(4:1:0.1 NMP/Ac2O/DIPEA) was applied to the resin for 10
min to cap any unreacted amines. As the final coupling, the thiol
linker (Mpa(Trt)-OH) was added to the N-terminus of the peptide using
the same reaction as the amino acids. After the synthesis, the resin
was washed extensively with DCM and dried completely. The peptides
were then cleaved from the resin using 94/2.5/2.5/1 TFA/H2O/EDT/TIS for 2.5 h. The TFA solution was removed by precipitating
the peptides in ice cold diethyl ether, centrifuging the precipitate,
removing the supernatant, and allowing the pellet to dry at RT. The
peptides were resuspended in 1:1 (H2O + 0.1% formic acid)/acetonitrile
with TCEP for a few hours to ensure complete thiol reduction before
HPLC purification.

4.6 Reverse-Phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)
Purification
HPLC purification was performed on a Shimadzu
HPLC–MS system
using a Waters column, C8, XBridge BEH OBD Prep Column, 19 mm ×
150 mm, 5 μm particle size, and 130 Å pore size. Methanol
and acetonitrile were HPLC-grade and purchased from Fisher Scientific.
Formic acid was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Water was Milli-Q filtered.
All peptides were purified using water + 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile
as the mobile phases, with the column temperature at 60 °C. After
elution, the acetonitrile was removed by rotary evaporation, and the
samples were immediately lyophilized to minimize disulfide formation.
All PAs were purified using water + 0.1% formic acid and methanol
as the mobile phases at 25 °C. Immediately after elution, the
fractions were buffered with 1 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 6.8.
The methanol was then removed by rotary evaporation with the heat
bath set no higher than 30 °C, and the samples were immediately
lyophilized.

4.7 Conjugation of DSPE-PEG-Maleimide
to Thiol-Peptide
DSPE-PEG-maleimide and the thiol-p5314–29 peptide
(3:1) were each dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMF) at 37.5 and 50
mM, respectively. The peptide solution was diluted in 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and DSPE-PEG was then added to the mixture.
The final reaction mixture was 1:1 DMF/(sodium phosphate buffer) with
5 mM peptide and 15 mM DSPE-PEG maleimide. The reaction was allowed
to proceed for 1 h and then injected into the HPLC for purification.

The DMF allowed for increased concentration of the reaction mixture
and increased reaction rate, and the water with pH 7.4 sodium phosphate
buffer served to (1) maintain the specificity of the thiol–maleimide
reaction, (2) prevent maleimide hydrolysis while thiol conjugation
proceeded to completion, and (3) prevent DSPE-PEG ester hydrolysis.
After 1 h, the conjugation was complete according to LC–MS
evaluation. We then purified the PA from the reaction mixture using
RP-HPLC at 25 °C with water + 0.1% formic acid and methanol as
the mobile phase solvents. We buffered the collected fractions immediately
upon elution using 1 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 6.8. We then
immediately removed the methanol using a rotary evaporator and removed
the water by lyophilization.

4.8 Analytical Liquid Chromatography
and Mass
Spectrometry
Analytical LC–MS of the PA was performed
on an Agilent 6130 LCMS system in the University of Chicago’s
Mass Spectrometry Facility, using a Waters column, C8, XBridge, 4.6
mm × 150 mm, 5 μm particle size, and 130 Å pore size.
The ESI–MS conditions were the same as used in part D, except
that the fragmentor was increased to 250 to successfully ionize the
PA. The mobile phase solvents used were water + 0.1% TFA and methanol
at a total flow rate of 1 mL/min. The method used an isocratic phase
at 20% methanol from 0 to 2 min, a gradient from 20 to 80% methanol
from 2 to 5 min, 80 to 100% methanol from 5 to 15 min, washing at
100% methanol from 15 to 30 min, followed by equilibration at 20%
methanol from 30 to 45 min. The dwell volume from the pumps to the
UV detector for this machine was measured to be approximately 3 mL.

4.9 Micelle Formation and Dynamic Light Scattering
PAs were dissolved in DMSO to form a 10 mM stock solution, followed
by dilution to 100 μM in PBS. Following micelle formation, the
nanoparticles were filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. A correlation
function was measured using a Wyatt Mobius Dynamic Light Scattering
(DLS) in the Polymer Size Characterization Suite (sponsored in part
by Wyatt Technology Corp.) at the University of Chicago’s Institute
for Molecular Engineering. The correlation function was used to find
the hydrodynamic diameter (Dh) and polydispersity
index (PDI) using a cumulant analysis. The average values from 15
measurements were used.

4.10 Transmission Electron
Microscopy
Samples were prepared and imaged by the Advanced
Electron Microscopy
Core Facility at the University of Chicago. Grids (continuous carbon
on 200-mesh copper grids—EMS CF200-CU) were glow-discharged
for 30 s. The sample (100 μM) was applied soon after for 1 min.
The excess sample was blotted off. The grids were stained with two
washes of 0.75% uranyl formate and 45 s of 0.75% uranyl formate. Each
was blotted off. Grids were imaged on a Tecnai G2 F30 (FEI) electron
microscope operating at 300 kV.
