Despite
the vast availability of antibiotics, bacterial infections
remain a leading cause of death worldwide. In an effort to enhance
the armamentarium against resistant bacterial strains, 1,2,3-triazole
(5a–x) and sulfonate (7a–j) analogues of natural bioactive precursors were designed and synthesized.
Preliminary screening against two Gram-positive (Streptococcus
pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis) and four Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) was performed to assess the potency
of these analogues as antibacterial agents. Among all triazole analogues, 5e (derived from carvacrol) and 5u (derived from
2-hydroxy 1,4-naphthoquinone) bearing carboxylic acid functionality
emerged as potent antibacterial agents against S. pneumoniae (IC50: 62.53 and 39.33 μg/mL), E.
faecalis (IC50: 36.66 and 61.09 μg/mL),
and E. coli (IC50: 15.28
and 22.57 μg/mL). Furthermore, 5e and 5u also demonstrated moderate efficacy against multidrug-resistant E. coli strains and were therefore selected for further
biological studies. Compound 5e in combination with ciprofloxacin
displayed a synergistic effect on multidrug-resistant E. coli MRA11 and MRC17 strains, whereas compound 5u was selective against E. coli MRA11 strain. Growth kinetic studies on S. pneumoniae and E. coli treated with 5e and 5u showed an extended lag phase. 5e and 5u did not show significant cytotoxicity up to
100 μg/mL concentration on human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells.
Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis of bacterial cells
(S. pneumoniae and E.
coli) exposed to 5e and 5u clearly showed morphological changes and damaged cell walls. Moreover,
these compounds also significantly inhibited biofilm formation in S. pneumoniae and E. coli strains, which was visualized by scanning electron microscopic (SEM)
analysis. Treatment of larvae of Galleria mellonella (an in vivo model for antimicrobial studies) with 5e and 5u did not cause an alteration in the hemocyte
density, thereby indicating lack of an immune response, and were nontoxic
up to a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
rising levels of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria coupled
with the scarcity of upcoming antibiotics have emerged as one of the
most critical threats to public health in the 21st century.1 Moreover, inappropriate use of available antibiotics
has further worsened the situation, making previously treatable infections
untreatable. As a result, efficacy of the available antibiotics is
diminishing at a faster rate.2 MDR bacteria
are responsible for infecting at least 2 million people annually along
with the fatalities of at least 90 000 people in the United
States alone.3 Therefore, it has been recognized
as one of the top three threats by the World Health Organization (WHO).4 A recent report by the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) suggested that we are at the verge of entering
the “post-antibiotic era”.5 Thus, the development of antimicrobials with novel modes of action
to inhibit bacterial infections is desperately required.

One
of the most prominent features adopted by bacteria to develop
resistance toward antibiotics is the formation of biofilms.6 Biofilms are highly hydrated organized structures,
usually attached to both biotic and abiotic surfaces, multicellular
communities of cells encased within the self-produced protective extracellular
matrix. The biofilm-producing bacteria exhibit multifold resistance
to conventional antibiotics and less susceptibility to host immune
defenses and the external stresses.7 Biofilm-associated
diseases such as cystic fibrosis pneumonia, periodontitis, prostatitis,
recurrent urinary tract infection, and food-borne illnesses are posing
serious threats to human health.8 Moreover,
clogged filtration membranes, corroded pipes, or fouled immersed marine
surfaces, which act as a source for pathogens in water and food processing,
are other issues associated with biofilms.9

While a number of strategies are underway to develop antimicrobials
with the ability to inhibit biofilm formation, modification of natural
products has been proved to be a promising approach. Various literature
reports have cited the role of natural products and their derivatives
in the inhibition of biofilm formation. The incorporation of a triazole
moiety to the naturally occurring compounds has resulted in potent
antimicrobial analogues. For example, flustramine C-inspired pyrroloindoline-3-triazole
amides,10 indole-triazole amide conjugates,11 oroidin-triazole conjugates,12 2-aminoimidazole-triazole conjugates,13 TAGE-triazole conjugates,14 pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-triazole conjugates,15 triazole containing naamine A and isonaamine A mimics,16 and triazole derivatives of geraniol and farnesol17 were found to inhibit the biofilm formation
of several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Natural product-based
1,2,3-triazole analogues as anti-biofilm
agents.

Inspired by the significance of
incorporation of 1,2,3-triazole
functionality in the natural scaffold and in continuation of search
for potent antimicrobial agents,18−21 we used hydroxyl-containing natural
bioactive precursors including carvacrol, naphthoquinone, and 8-hydroxyquinoline
for the modification. We also incorporated sulfonate onto these natural
alcohols for comparison and screened all analogues against all tested
bacterial strains. Compared to their natural precursors, compounds 5e and 5u showed significantly improved IC50 values against S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and E. coli. Growth kinetic studies performed on S. pneumoniae and E. coli treated with lead inhibitors (5e and 5u) showed their bacteriostatic nature. Importantly, these compounds
strongly inhibit the formation of biofilm in the S.
pneumoniae and E. coli strains and showed moderate potency against the resistant E. coli isolates. Furthermore, the selected compounds
(5e and 5u) were also subjected to in vitro
(hemolysis and cytotoxicity assays) as well as in vivo toxicity assays
on G. mellonella and found to be nontoxic.
The study revealed that 5e and 5u provide
a suitable core to be exploited for further structure–activity
relationship (SAR) studies to develop potent antibacterial agents.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
The
1,2,3-triazole analogues
(5a–x) of natural precursors were synthesized
using the general synthesis approach, as shown in Scheme 1. Commercially available carvacrol
(1a), 8-hydroxyquinoline (1b), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(1c) were propargylated in the presence of propargyl
bromide and potassium carbonate to yield corresponding alkyne (2a–c). In another set of reaction, variously substituted
aniline bearing electron-withdrawing/electron-donating groups (3a–h) were converted into their corresponding azides
(4a–h) via diazotization using sodium nitrite
and hydrochloric acid followed by sodium azide treatment. Finally,
azide (4a–h) and alkyne (2a–c) underwent Cu(I)-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction in the
presence of catalytic amount of CuSO4·5H2O and sodium ascorbate in tetrahydrofuran (THF)/H2O (1:2)
mixture to yield the title compounds (5a–x) in
quantitative yields (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1,2,3-Triazole Derivatives of Natural
Precursors
For the synthesis
of sulfonic esters, natural precursors (1a–b)
were treated with aryl/heteroaryl/aliphatic sulfonyl
chlorides (6a–e) in the presence of triethylamine
base to yield sulfonate derivatives (7a–j) in
quantitative yield (Scheme 2). All intermediates and title compounds (5a–x) and (7a–j) were well characterized using multi
spectroscopic techniques, and purity was established by liquid chromatography
(LC)–mass spectrometry (MS). Single crystal structures of 1,2,3-triazole
derivatives (5c and 5f) and sulfonic ester
derivatives (7g and 7h) were also recorded
to further confirm the proposed structures.

Esters of Natural Precursors
2.2 X-ray Crystallographic Analysis
Single
X-ray crystal structure analysis of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives (5c and 5f) and sulfonic ester derivatives (7g and 7h) was done to support structural analysis
data. The crystal data and structure refinement details are presented
in Table 1. A colorless
crystal of compound 5c (C19H20ClN3O), with approximate dimensions of 0.18 × 0.10 ×
0.03 mm3, was used for X-ray crystallographic analysis.
The compound crystallized in a triclinic crystal system with the space
group P1̅ (Figure 2A). The unit cell contains two molecules
with similar conformations, through which strong C–H···N
hydrogen bonds (C1A–H1A···N2B 2.611 Å;
C1B–H1B···N2A 2.430 Å; C22A–H22A···N3B
2.361 Å; C22B–H22B···N3A 2.488 Å)
generate linear chains along the a-axis with alternative
orientation of A and B molecules (Figure 2B). Moreover, the crystal packing of 5c presents the formation of additional C–H···π
interaction between the molecules (C3A–H3A···C24A
2.734 Å) and C–H···O interactions between
the molecules (C12B–H12E···O1B 2.688 Å).
These interactions led to the formation of dimeric units (see Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 2C represents
the XP diagram of the compound 5f with 50% probability
level of thermal ellipsoids. The structure of compound 5f (C20H23N3O), a colorless platelike
specimen, with approximate dimensions of 0.072 × 0.233 ×
0.255 mm3, was elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
The crystal structure analysis revealed that it crystallizes in a
monoclinic crystal system with the space group P21/c. In the packing diagram of 5f, linear chains along the b-axis containing a double
layer of alternating molecules were observed (Figure 2D). These chains are formed via C–H···N
hydrogen bonds and C–H···π and π···π
interactions. The shortest distance between the triazole derivative
units is 3.392 Å and represents the centroid distance Cg1···Cg1. Two types of
C–H···N hydrogen bonds were found, one between
two neighbored triazole units and the second type between one triazole
ring and the phenyl substituent at N1 atom (C1–H1···N2
2.381 Å; C22–H22···N3 2.641 Å). In
addition, C–H···π interaction involving
two phenoxy substituents (C13–H13···Cg2 2.683 Å) is contributing to the stability of this
packing diagram. The resulted double layer chains are along the c-axis connected via π···π interactions
between the triazole ring and the phenyl substituent (Cg3···Cg4 3.408 Å) (see Figure
S2 in the Supporting Information).

X-ray crystallographic analysis of compound 7g (C15H10N2O5S), a colorless needlelike
specimen, of approximate dimensions 0.092 × 0.169 × 0.322
mm3 revealed that it crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal
system with the space group P21/c. The XP diagram of compound 7g with ellipsoids
drawn at a 50% probability level along with the atomic numbering scheme
is shown in Figure 3A. In the packing diagram, a complex three-dimensional (3D) network
involving intermolecular C–H···O and π···π
interactions was found. The partial overlapping mode between the nitrobenzene
substituent and the quinoline unit (Cg1···Cg2 3.288 Å) combined with C–H···O
hydrogen bonds involving the sulfonate unit leads to the formation
of wave chains along the b-axis (Figure 3B). Additional C–H···O
hydrogen bonds of the nitro and sulfonate groups complete the 3D network
(see Table S17 in the Supporting Information).

scheme (50% probability level of thermal ellipsoids); (B) wave chain

and CH···O interactions in the packing diagram of 7g; (C) XP diagram of compound 7h with atomic
labeling scheme (50% probability level of thermal ellipsoids); and
(D) linear chain of dimeric units along ab-diagonal
formed via CH···O and π···π
interactions in the packing diagram of 7h.

X-ray crystallographic analysis was used to unambiguously
confirm
the structure of compound 7h (C16H13NO3S), a colorless platelike specimen, with approximate
dimensions of 0.020 × 0.100 × 0.160 mm3. Crystal
structure analysis of compound 7h revealed that it crystallizes
in a triclinic crystal system with the space group P1̅. The XP diagram of compound 7h with ellipsoids
drawn at a 50% probability level along with atomic numbering scheme
is shown in Figure 3C. For compound 7h, a 3D network involving C–H···O,
C–H···N, C–H···π,
and π···π interactions was observed. In
contrast to the packing diagram of 7h, a lower overlapping
mode between quinoline and p-tolyl groups was observed.
The strongest interactions (C–H···O hydrogen
bonds) were found between sulfonate and quinoline groups (C8–H8···O1
2.466 Å) and are leading to the formation of dimeric units. These
dimers are connected along ab-diagonal through weak
π···π interactions to linear chains (Figure 3D). Additional interactions
(C–H···O, C–H···π,
and C–H···N) are stabilizing the structure of
this compound (see Table S21 in the Supporting Information).

2.3 In Vitro Antibacterial
Activity
All
natural precursors and their triazole/sulfonate analogues were primarily
screened for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (S. pneumoniae and E. faecalis) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa, S. enterica, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli) sensitive bacterial
strains. Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was used as a reference drug, and the
results are presented in terms of IC50 values in Table 2. The results showed
that compounds exhibited moderate to potent antibacterial activity
against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, as
compared to natural precursors, compounds 5e and 5u with p-carboxylic acid substitution emerged
as potent inhibitors of E. coli with
IC50 values of 15.28 and 22.57 μg/mL, respectively.
Moreover, these compounds also inhibited the growth of S. pneumoniae (62.53 and 39.33 μg/mL, respectively)
as well as E. faecalis with IC50 values of 36.66 and 61.09 μg/mL, respectively. It
was observed that the corresponding analogue of quinoline, 5m, exhibited moderate inhibitory effect on the same bacterial strains
(S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and E. coli). The analogues of carvacrol
(5a) and quinoline (5i) with unsubstituted
phenyl substituent clearly lost their potential against all bacterial
strains, whereas the corresponding analogue of naphthoquinone (5q) displayed IC50 values of 96.99, 101.23, and
99.53 μg/mL against S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and E. coli, respectively. None of the halogen-substituted
(p-fluoro and p-chloro substitution)
compounds exhibited potency against any of the bacterial strains except
compound 5r with p-fluoro substitution,
which showed a modest effect on S. pneumoniae and E. coli with IC50 values
of 133.86 and 164.78 μg/mL, respectively. Except the moderate
effect of compound 5d on K. pneumoniae (IC50 = 121.83 μg/mL), none of the p-nitro-substituted analogues exhibited potency against any of the
strains tested. The analogues bearing electron-donating substituents
such as p-methyl and p-methoxy exhibited
better inhibition of all bacterial strains in comparison to halogen-substituted
(p-fluoro and p-chloro substitution)
analogues, where the activity was considerably lost against all strains.
Among all p-sulfonamide-substituted analogues, 5x moderately inhibited the growth of S. pneumoniae and E. coli strains with IC50 values of 85.23 and 103.54 μg/mL, respectively, whereas it
exhibited potent effect on E. faecalis with an IC50 value of 39.23 μg/mL. Among all sulfonic
ester analogues (7a–j), the compound derived from
carvacrol (7a) with an unsubstituted phenyl ring displayed
a moderate activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae with IC50 values of 112.94 and 117.09 μg/mL, respectively. Compound 7d with n-butyl tail exhibited an IC50 value of
95.54 μg/mL against K. pneumoniae. Compounds 7d and 7e with a thiophenyl
ring displayed moderate potency against P. aeruginosa with IC50 values of 118.45 and 119.04 μg/mL, respectively.
None of the sulfonic esters derived from quinoline exhibited a significant
effect on any of the bacterial strains. The in vitro antibacterial
evaluation results showed the importance of incorporation of a triazole
scaffold over sulfonic esters.

(μg/mL)a
a The value obtained in at least three
separate assays done in triplicate.

On the basis of the results obtained on sensitive
bacterial strains,
compounds 5e and 5u were selected for further
screening on eight multidrug-resistant E. coli strains. It was observed that at 1024 μg/mL concentration
[minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)], compounds 5e exhibited more than 95% inhibition of E. coli MRA11, MRC24, MRAE26, MRAE32, and MROB11 strains, whereas at the
same concentration, it caused 79, 86, and 86% inhibition of E. coli MRC17, MRAE33, and MRAE44 strains, respectively.
Compound 5u at the MIC value (1024 μg/mL) caused
nearly 100% inhibition of the growth of MRC17, MRC24, MRAE26, MRAE32,
MRAE33, and MROB11 strains, whereas it caused only 70% inhibition
of MRAE44 growth, showing moderate efficacy on this strain. 5u was also effective on MRA11 strain, causing more than 90%
inhibition of growth, indicating moderate efficacy of these compounds
in comparison to CIP, which showed almost 100% inhibition at a concentration
lower than those of the compounds (Figure 4). These compounds were further evaluated
for their in vitro synergistic effects in combination with CIP against E. coli MRA11, MRC17, and MRAE33 strains. The results
indicated that antibacterial activity of 5e against all
three strains was significantly enhanced when used in combination
with CIP. Compound 5u in combination with CIP exhibited
a significant improvement in antibacterial activity against E. coli MRAE33, whereas it exhibited a moderate activity
against E. coli MRA11. The fractional
inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values of compound 5e were 0.03 against E. coli MRA11 and
MRC17 strains, indicating high synergistic effect, whereas compound 5u exhibited partial synergy against E. coli MRA11 with an FICI value of 0.62. None of the compound exhibited
synergistic effect in combination with CIP against E. coli MRAE33 (Tables 3 and 4). These results
prompted us to explore the effect of these inhibitors (5e and 5u) on the growth kinetics of S.
pneumoniae and E. coli. The kinetic studies showed that both compounds exhibited inhibitory
effects on the growth pattern of S. pneumoniae and E. coli strains. Compound 5e was found to be more potent as it effectively inhibited
the growth of S. pneumoniae even at
a sub-MIC concentration (62.5 μg/mL). Furthermore, no significant
growth of E. coli was observed at MIC
and 2MIC concentrations up to 22 h of incubation, whereas at a sub-MIC
concentration, a suppressed growth was observed with a lag phase of
approximately 6 h. Compound 5u was found to be less effective
as growth in S. pneumoniae could be
observed in 8 and 9 h at sub-MIC and MIC concentrations, respectively,
whereas in the case of E. coli, growth
was observed at 6 and 9 h at sub-MIC and MIC concentrations of 5u. An increase in turbidity representing bacterial growth
post 22 h in all test cultures indicated the bacteriostatic nature
of 5e and 5u (Figure 5).

columns correspond to the MIC concentrations of 5e, 5u, and CIP.

2.4 TEM Analysis of S. pneumoniae and E. coli Cells Treated with 5e and 5u
TEM analysis was performed
to check the effect of 5e and 5u on the
morphology of S. pneumoniae and E. coli cells. The cell culture of E. coli treated with MIC concn of 5e and 5u and untreated cells (control) were used for
TEM analysis. It was observed that the treated cells showed moderate
to severe cellular deformities, whereas untreated cells were normal
in shape with an intact cell wall. The treatment of bacterial cells
with 5e and 5u significantly damaged the
cell wall, resulting in the loss of integrity and cytosolic oozing.
The degraded cell wall of bacteria observed in the TEM micrographs
proposes the bactericidal activity of test compounds. Their antibacterial
mode of action needs to be further characterized (Figure 6).

2.5 Effect of 5e and 5u on the Biofilm Formation
2.5.1 Assessment of Anti-Biofilm
Activity by Tetrazolium
Salt (XTT) Reduction Assay
The effect of lead compounds (5e and 5u) on biofilm formation was determined
using E. coli and S.
pneumoniae strains. The compounds exhibited significant
inhibition of biofilm formation in both the strains. Compounds 5e and 5u inhibited the biofilm formation in E. coli by 95.23 and 92.26% at a concentration of
125 μg/mL (2MIC) of 5e and 250 μg/mL (2MIC)
of 5u, respectively. Similarly, in the case of S. pneumoniae, 92.26 and 100% inhibition was observed
at a concentration of 250 μg/mL (2MIC) of 5e and 5u, respectively. From the results, it was concluded that
both compounds could be further customized to develop as potent anti-biofilm
agents (Figure 7).

columns correspond to the 2MIC concentrations of 5e and 5u, respectively.

2.5.2 Assessment of Anti-Biofilm Activity by Crystal
Violet Assay
Anti-biofilm activity of the lead compounds
(5e and 5u) on E. coli and S. pneumoniae strains was further
determined by crystal-violet assay. Compound 5e inhibited
the biofilm formation in E. coli by
94.32% at 125 μg/mL (2MIC) concentration and in S. pneumoniae by 93.36% at a concentration of 250
μg/mL (2MIC). Similarly, compound 5u inhibited
the biofilm formation by 77.26 and 98.28% in E. coli and in S. pneumoniae, respectively,
at a concentration of 250 μg/mL (2MIC) (Figure 7). To assess the viability of bacterial cells
post treatment, colony forming unit (CFU) count was also performed
(Table 5). The viability
data showed that compounds 5e and 5u were
able to reduce the colony formation of bacterial cells when compared
with untreated counterparts. Analysis of biomass formation in control
and treated samples demonstrated higher biomass formation in control
samples. The OD590 values presenting the biofilm formation
via viable cells revealed maximum biomass in the control sample followed
by samples treated with test compounds 5e and 5u followed by CIP-treated cells, thus showing a maximum antimicrobial
activity (Figure 8).

2.5.3 Assessment of Biofilm Inhibition by SEM
Analysis
SEM analysis was also carried out to validate the
effect of lead compounds 5e and 5u on biofilm
formation in E. coli strain. On exposure
to the 2MIC concentration of 5e and 5u,
significant inhibition of biofilm formation was observed in the treated
cells. In untreated samples, the cells appeared in clusters with a
polysaccharide matrix, which showed the formation of a biofilm, whereas
cells treated with 2MIC concentration of 5e showed scattered
single cells with significant cell damage. Compound 5u, although significantly effective in inhibiting biofilm formation,
was less potent than 5e as the cell integrity was lost
to lesser extent in the latter case (Figure 9).

2.6 Toxicity Evaluation of Lead Compounds by in
Vitro (MTT and Hemolytic Assay) and in Vivo (on G.
mellonella Larvae) Studies
2.6.1 Toxicity
Studies by MTT and Hemolytic Assays
The cytotoxicity of the
lead inhibitors (5e and 5u) was evaluated
by MTT assay on HEK293 cells (Figure 10A). The results
showed that both the compounds retained more than 75% cell viability
at 50 μg/mL concentration but exhibited moderate toxicity at
a concentration of 200 μg/mL (more than 50% cell viability).
On increasing the concentration to 400 μg/mL, cell viability
further decreased, which indicated that the compounds possess some
toxicity at higher concentrations. At the IC50 concentration,
these compounds could be considered nontoxic and thus can be further
investigated for in vivo evaluation. To exclude any possible toxicity
on human red blood cells (hRBCs), hemolytic assay was also performed
with 5e and 5u. At 200 μg/mL concentration,
compounds 5e and 5u caused only 9% cell
lysis in comparison to 0.8% cell lysis caused by CIP at the same concentration.
More interestingly, compounds 5e and 5u were
found to exhibit insignificant toxicity up to 600 μg/mL with
only 22 and 12% cell lysis, respectively (Figure 10B).

line and (B) hemolytic
assay for compounds 5e, 5u, and CIP on hRBCs.

2.7 In Vivo
Toxicity Evaluation of 5e and 5u on G. mellonella Larvae
Because immune response
of insects exhibits remarkable
similarities to the innate immune response of mammals, insects have
been used as models for the evaluation of toxicity of antimicrobial
drugs. It has been reported previously that G. mellonella has been utilized to assess the toxicity of novel antimicrobial
drugs and the results showed a strong correlation with those obtained
using mammals.22 An in vivo study on the
larvae of G. mellonella showed that
viability of the larvae was not affected up to the concentration of
2.5 mg/mL of test compounds (5e and 5u),
indicating their nontoxic behavior towards the larvae (Figure 11A–C). Moreover, at
the same concentration, hemocyte density of the larvae was not significantly
affected, which indicated lack of an immune response (Figure 11D).

2.8 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and
Excretion (ADME) Profiling
The computational prediction of
important physicochemical descriptors related to absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion properties represents a cost-effective strategy
to filter out molecules at early stages of drug-discovery process.23 Here, we did in silico physicochemical prediction
for all analogues (5a–x and 7a–j) using QikProp version 3.2, Schrödinger software.24 Particularly, we predicted total polar surface
area, the number of rotatable bonds (NRB), aqueous solubility (QP
log S), binding to human serum albumin (QP log Khsa), brain/blood partition coefficient (QP
log BB), Caco-2 and MDCK permeability, and estimation of % human oral
absorption, which indicated the druglike characteristics of these
compounds. In addition, Lipinski’s parameters for drug-likeliness
were also calculated, which states that any orally active drugs should
not violate more than one of its parameters.25 These compounds follow Lipinski’s rule of 5 and possessed
moderate to good % human oral absorption. Therefore, these compounds
have the potential to be carried forward for SAR and pharmacological
investigations. All results of in silico physicochemical prediction
are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel series
of 1,2,3-triazole/sulfonate analogues
derived from natural bioactive alcohols were synthesized and evaluated
for their potential as antibacterial agents against a panel of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Most of the compounds displayed
good to moderate antibacterial activity across the panel. Compounds 5e and 5u emerged as potent antibacterial agents
against sensitive S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, and E. coli strains as well as moderately effective against MDR E. coli strains. Compound 5e in combination
with CIP showed a synergistic effect on MDR E. coli MRA11 and MRC17 strains, whereas compound 5u was selective
against E. coli MRA11. Further, growth
kinetic studies confirmed the bacteriostatic nature of the test compounds.
TEM analysis showed that 5e and 5u caused
significant cell wall damage and membrane disruption of bacterial
cells (S. pneumoniae and E. coli), leading to cell death. Moreover, these
compounds were also found to be potent anti-biofilm agents on S. pneumoniae and E. coli strains and exhibited noncytotoxicity on the HEK293 cell line up
to a concentration of 100 μg/mL. Besides, these compounds did
not cause an alteration in the hemocyte density, indicating the lack
of an immune response, and were nontoxic on the larvae of G. mellonella up to the concn of 2.5 mg/mL. Our study
firmly supports further structural optimization of these compounds
(5e and 5u) for the development of potent
and safer antibacterial agents.

Section
4.1 Chemistry
All chemicals and solvents
(analytical grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Thin-layer
chromatographic analysis was carried out on precoated Merck silica
gel 60 F254 TLC aluminum sheets, and spots were visualized
under UV light at 254 nm and I2 vapor staining. IR spectra
were recorded on an Agilent Cary 630 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer,
and only major peaks are reported in cm–1. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3/DMSO-d6 as a solvent with tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard on a Bruker SpectroSpin DPX-300 spectrometer
at 300 and 75 MHz, respectively. Splitting patterns are designated
as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet),
sep (septet), or br s (broad). 1H NMR chemical shift (δ)
values are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual
solvent (CDCl3, δ 7.26; DMSO-d6, δ 2.54), 13C NMR chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in ppm relative to CDCl3 (δ 77.16; DMSO-d6, δ 39.5), and coupling constants (J) are expressed in hertz (Hz). Mass spectra were recorded
on an Agilent Quadrupole-6150 LC–MS spectrometer. Melting points
were measured on a digital Buchi melting point apparatus (M-560) and
are uncorrected. Purity was determined by an Agilent RRLC MS 6320
ion trap spectrometer using an XBridge C18 1.7 μm column (50
mm × 2.1 mm). Mobile phase channel A consisted of 5 mM ammonium
acetate in water. Mobile phase B consisted of acetonitrile with a
flow rate = 0.8 mL/min; detection was done by UV@214 nm, and all final
compounds were confirmed to have ≥95% purity. Purification
of the compounds was carried out by silica gel column chromatography
(230–400 mesh size) with the indicated eluent.

4.5 General Procedure for the Synthesis of Sulfonic
Esters (7a–j)
To a solution of natural
precursors (1a–b) (1.0 mmol) in dichloromethane
(10 mL) was added triethylamine (2.0 mmol) followed by aryl/heteroaryl/aliphatic
sulfonyl chloride (6a–e) (1.5 mmol) under an inert
atmosphere. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 3–4 h. After completion of the reaction, water was added
and dichloromethane phase was separated, dried over anhyd sodium sulfate,
and evaporated under vacuo. The crude product was purified either
by crystallization from ethanol or by column chromatography eluted
by using ethyl acetate/hexane (3:7) to yield pure sulfonic esters.27

4.6 X-ray Crystallographic
Analysis
The
structures of compounds 5c, 5f, 7g, and 7h were unambiguously established by X-ray crystallographic
analysis. Single crystals of 5c, 7g, and 7h were obtained through the slow evaporation of their mixed
solvent system containing dichloromethane, hexane, methanol, and ethyl
acetate, whereas single crystal of 5f was obtained through
the slow evaporation of its ethyl acetate and hexane solution. Suitable
crystal of compound 5c (C19H20ClN3O) was selected and analyzed on a Nonius Kappa charge-coupled
device (CCD) diffractometer, and single crystals of compounds 5f (C20H23N3O) and 7g (C15H10N2O5S) were analyzed on a D8 Venture Dual Source 100 CMOS diffractometer
(Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with Cu radiation (Cu Kα = 1.54178
Å). For analyzing the single crystal of compound 7h (C16H13NO3S), a Bruker APEX II
Kappa CCD diffractometer was utilized. Intensity data were collected
at 100 K using ϕ and ω scans. No significant loss in intensities
was observed during data collection. Multiscan absorption corrections
were applied to the intensity data empirically using Denzo for 5c(28) and SADABS V2014/229 for 5f, 7g, and 7h. Data collection, reduction, and refinement were performed
using COLLECT,30 Denzo-SMN,31 and SHELXL-9732 softwares
for 5c, and for 5f, 7g, and 7h, APEX2 V2014.5-0,33 SAINT V8.34A,34 and SHELXL-201435 softwares were used, respectively. Crystal structures were solved
by direct methods using SHELXL-9736 for 5c and SHELXT-201435 for 5f, 7g, and 7h and refined with
full-matrix least-squares based on F2 using
SHELXT-2014.35 All nonhydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were first located in the
Fourier difference map, then positioned geometrically, and allowed
to ride on their respective parent atoms. The molecular graphics and
crystallographic illustrations were prepared using XP.37,38

4.7 In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity
All
synthesized compounds (5a–x and 7a–j) were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae (MTCC 655), E. faecalis (MTCC 439), P. aeruginosa (MTCC 2453), S. enterica (MTCC 3224), K. pneumoniae (ATCC 700603), E. coli (ATCC 25922),
and multidrug-resistant strains viz. E. coli MRA11 (GenBank accession no. KJ957160), MRC17 (GenBank accession no. KJ906623), MRC24
(GenBank accession no. KM822765), MRAE26 (GenBank accession no. KJ923014), MRAE32
(GenBank accession no. KJ923017), MRAE33 (GenBank accession no. KM822768), MRAE44
(GenBank accession no. KJ923018), and MROB11 (GenBank accession
no. KC963018) using the broth dilution technique according to the standard protocol
for antibacterial assessment by CLSI.39 CIP was used as a positive control for the studies. All compounds
were dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted in broth medium to achieve
the final concentration of DMSO less than 4%. Varying concentrations
(1000 to 7.8 μg/mL) of test compounds were dispensed into a
96-well plate in nutrient broth in a final volume of 100 μL.
Then, 100 μL of bacterial cells (approximately 2.5 × 106 cells/mL) was dispensed into the 96-well plate (Tarson) and
incubated at 37 °C for overnight. After the incubation period,
each well was analyzed for the presence or absence of visual growth
of bacterial cells. The lowest concentration of the test compound
at which no visible growth occurs represents its MIC value. Moreover,
after incubation, the growth was measured turbidometrically at 600
nm using a Thermo Multiskan Go spectrophotometer. IC50 was
determined as 50% inhibition of bacterial cell growth and calculated
by plotting a graph between concentration (log10) and %
inhibition. In the case of MDR isolates, varying concentrations (8–1024
μg/mL for 5e and 5u and 0.49–63.3
μg/mL for CIP) were dispensed into a 96-well plate (Tarson)
in Luria broth medium. Then, the medium was inoculated with 10 μL
of 1000 times diluted 0.1OD600 culture and incubated overnight
at 37 °C. The optical density (OD) was measured at 600 nm using
a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Multiskan Go). Percentage inhibition
of these resistant isolates was calculated using the formula  where a = pure culture reading
– media reading and b = test reading –
plain compound reading (if the compound is a colored solution).

4.8 Synergistic Study
The antimicrobial
activity of the test compounds in combination with CIP was determined
following the checkerboard method. A 96-well microtiter plate was
inoculated with 100 μL of Mueller-Hinton broth followed by addition
of compounds 5e and 5u with the concentration
ranging from 1024 to 16 μg/mL and CIP with the concentration
ranging from 128 to 2 μg/mL. Each well was inoculated with 100
μL of a suspension of 5 × 105 CFU/mL in a final
volume of 200 μL. Inocula were prepared by direct suspension
in Mueller-Hinton broth of bacteria grown overnight on MacConkey medium
in order to obtain 0.5 McFarland standard. The checkerboard plates
were then incubated for overnight at 37 °C. The FICI is defined
as the sum of the MICs of each drug when used in combination divided
by the MIC of the drug used alone. Synergy and antagonism were defined
by FICI ≤ 0.5 and >4, respectively. Partially synergistic
was
denoted by 0.5 > FICI < 1, whereas indifferent was defined by
1
< FICI ≤ 4.40

4.9 Growth Kinetic Studies
The bacterial
strains S. pneumoniae and E. coli were freshly revived by subculturing on the
nutrient agar plate. A loop of inoculum was introduced into the nutrient
broth medium and incubated in an automated incubator shaker for 12
h at 37 °C. On the second day, approx. 2 × 106 cells/mL of overnight grown culture were inoculated in 50 mL of
sterile nutrient broth medium. Different concentrations (2MIC, MIC,
and MIC/2) of inhibitors 5e and 5u were
added into the culture medium and incubated at 37 °C and 160
rpm. CIP at a concentration 10 μg/mL was used as a positive
control drug. Aliquots (1 mL) of culture were removed from each test
sample at time interval of 2 h (i.e., time points of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 h), and growth was measured turbidometrically
at 600 nm using a Thermo Multiskan Go spectrophotometer. OD was recorded
for each concentration against time (h).41

4.10 TEM Analysis
The morphology of S. pneumoniae and E. coli cells was analyzed using TEM following the standard protocol.42 Briefly, the cells were harvested, standardized
(A600 ≈ 0.1), and exposed to 62.5
and 125 μg/mL concn of test inhibitors 5e for E. coli and S. pneumoniae, respectively, and 125 μg/mL of 5u for both the
strains for 1 h. Then, the cells were washed thrice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) to remove the residual medium and fixed overnight in
2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate/magnesium buffer (40 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2). The cells were washed twice for 15 min in 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and postfixed for 2 h in 2% osmium tetroxide.
Again, the cells were washed twice for 15 min in distilled water and
then en bloc stained with 1% uranyl acetate (aqueous) for 30 min.
After two further washes, cells were dehydrated in 95 and 100% ethanol.
The cells were exposed to propylene oxide for 2 × 10 min and
infiltrated for 1 h in 1:1 propylene/epoxy embedding material (Epon)
mixture and then overnight in fresh Epon. After polymerization for
48 h at 60 °C, ultrathin sections were cut using a microtome
(Leica EM UC6) and transferred onto a copper grid. The samples were
stained with uranyl acetate (saturated solution of uranyl acetate
in 50% alcohol) followed by lead citrate. The samples were washed
three times in Milli-Q water and dried by blotting with Whatman filter
paper. The sections were examined with a Tecnai G2 20 high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (Fei Company, The Netherlands) at
200 kV.

4.11 Assessment of Anti-Biofilm Activity by XTT
Assay
A semi-quantitative measurement of metabolic activity
of bacterial biofilm was obtained from the XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium-hydroxide) reduction assay.43 A serial 2-fold dilution pattern was prepared in the medium
wells with the concentration of antibacterial agents ranging from
7.812 to 1000 μg/mL. Aliquots of 100 μL of tryptic soy
broth (TSB) with a bacterial inoculum of 5 × 105 CFU/mL
were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under
static conditions. The medium was discarded and washed with PBS to
remove the nonadherent bacteria. To each well, 50 μL of prepared
XTT salt solution (HiMedia, India) was added and plates were incubated
at 37 °C in dark for 90 min. Bacterial dehydrogenase activity
reduces XTT tetrazolium salt to XTT formazan, resulting in colorimetric
change (turns to orange) that was correlated with cell viability.
The colorimetric changes were measured spectrophotometrically at 490
nm.44 The % inhibition data were interpreted
from dose–response curves.

4.12 Assessment
of Anti-Biofilm Activity by Crystal-Violet
Assay
Biofilm formation by E. coli and S. pneumoniae was investigated
using crystal violet assay based on the methods of O’Toole
& Kolter.45 Cultures were grown in
TSB (containing 2.5 g/L glucose) until OD600 reached 0.1
(equivalent to 0.5 McFarland). The cultures were diluted in fresh
TSB medium in a 1:1 ratio (added 100 μL of culture in 100 μL
of broth), and polystyrene 96-well microtitre plates were filled with
200 μL of culture per well and incubated at 37 °C for 48
h. After incubation, cultures were removed and microtitre plate wells
were gently washed four times with 200 μL of sterile PBS (1×
PBS, pH—7.2) to remove loosely associated bacteria. Cells that
had adhered to the wells were stained with 200 μL of 0.1% (w/v)
crystal violet at room temperature for 20 min. The wells were washed
again with 1× PBS or sterile distilled water. The crystal violet
that had stained the cells was solubilized in 250 μL of 95%
(v/v) ethanol. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature,
and biofilm formation was quantified by measuring the OD at 590 nm
in an ELISA plate reader (Thermo Scientific, Multiscan Go). To observe
the change in the amount of biofilm formation in the presence of compounds 5e, 5u, and CIP at a subinhibitory level, TSB
medium was supplemented with 125, 250, and 8 μg/mL, respectively,
for E. coli and 250, 250, and 8 μg/mL,
respectively, for S. pneumoniae. The
wells containing TSB medium alone were used as blank.

The percentage
of biofilm inhibition was calculated by the formula  where a = pure culture reading
– media reading and b = test reading –
plain compound reading (if the compound is a colored solution).

4.13 Assessment of Biofilm Inhibition by SEM Analysis
SEM analysis was performed to determine the biofilm formation by E. coli. The fresh bacterial cultures were prepared
and inoculated into six-well cell culture plates containing 3 mL of
TSB (containing 2.5 g/L glucose). Glass coverslips (8 mm diam) were
dispensed into each well for biofilm formation on the surface and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Post incubation, plates were removed
and test compounds were added to determine the anti-biofilm effect.
Parafilm-sealed plates were further incubated for the next 24 h. Coverslips
were removed after total incubation of 24 h and washed with 0.1 M
PBS. Biofilms that formed on the coverslips were placed in a fixative
(4%, v/v, formaldehyde in PBS) overnight. Samples were again washed
with PBS, and then coverslips were left to dry and later examined
under a scanning electron microscope.46

4.14 Cytotoxicity by MTT Assay
MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), 0.25% trypsin, and a 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) mixture were purchased from HiMedia (Mumbai, India). Fetal
bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY). The
human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line was procured from National
Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Pune, India. The cells were cultured
and maintained as a monolayer in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin)
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in T-25
flasks. The cells were subcultured twice in a week. A cell count of
approximately 2 × 104 cells per well was seeded in
a 96-well plate (150 μL per well) and incubated for 24 h before
treatment. The cells were then treated with varying concentrations
(10–400 μg/mL) of the test compounds. After 48 h of incubation
at 37 °C, the exhausted serum-supplemented medium was removed
and serum-free medium (50 μL) was added into each well. After
that, 20 μL per well of MTT at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in
PBS was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h at
37 °C. Formazan crystals, the metabolized MTT product, were solubilized
in DMSO (150 μL per well) and were quantified by reading the
absorbance at 570 nm after incubation of 10 min on an iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All assays were performed
in triplicate. Percent viability was taken as the relative absorbance
of treated versus untreated control cells.21

4.15 Hemolytic Assay
The hemolytic activities
of the test inhibitors 5e and 5u and the
conventional antibacterial drug CIP (HiMedia) were determined on hRBCs.21 Human erythrocytes from healthy individuals
were collected in tubes containing EDTA as an anticoagulant. The erythrocytes
were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 20 °C
and washed three times in PBS. To the pellet, PBS was added to yield
a 10% (v/v) erythrocyte/PBS suspension. The 10% suspension of erythrocytes
was then further diluted with PBS at a 1:10 ratio. The final diluted
erythrocytes (100 μL) were added to 100 μL of PBS having
a previously determined concentration gradient (1000 to 7.8 μg/mL)
of test compounds in microcentrifuge tubes. Total hemolysis was achieved
with 1% Triton X-100. The tubes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C
and then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and at room temperature.
From the supernatant fluid, 150 μL was transferred to a flat-bottomed
microtitre plate (Tarson), and the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically
at 450 nm by using a Thermo Multiskan Go spectrophotometer. The hemolysis
percentage was calculated by following the equation:  where A450 is
absorbance at 450 nm.

4.16 In Vivo Toxicity Evaluation
of 5e and 5u in G. mellonella Larvae
The larvae of the sixth developmental stage of G. mellonella were obtained from the Mealworm Company
(Sheffield, England). The larvae of G. mellonella were stored in wood shavings in the dark at 15 °C prior to
use. The larvae that were chosen for experiments weighed 0.21 g and
were used within 3–4 weeks of receipt. Ten healthy larvae were
placed in sterile 9 cm Petri dishes with Whatman filter paper inserted
inside. A culture of S. pneumoniae and E. coli was grown to the stationary phase (1–2
× 108/mL) in YEPD broth at 30 °C and 200 rpm.
The cells were harvested by centrifugation (2056g for 5 min on a Beckmann GS-6 bench centrifuge), washed in PBS, and
resuspended in PBS at a cell density 5 × 105 per 20
μL. The larvae were inoculated by injecting 20 μL through
the last left proleg into the hemocoel using a Myjector syringe (Terumo
Europe) and placed at 30 °C in the dark. One hour post inoculation,
the larvae were inoculated with compounds 5e and 5u, both at a concentrations of 2.5 mg suspended in PBS, and
supplemented with 12.5% DMSO (v/v), through the last right proleg.
The larvae injected with 20 μL of PBS supplemented with 12.5%
DMSO (v/v) were used as controls. For assessment of larval viability,
the larvae were gently probed with a needle, and if no response was
observed, the larvae were considered to be dead.

Three larvae
were inoculated with 20 μL of 5e and 5u solutions at a concentration of 1.25 or 2.5 mg/mL. The larvae were
then incubated at 30 °C, in the dark, for 24 h. The hemocyte
density in the larvae was ascertained by piercing the backs of the
anterior end (“head”) of the three larvae with a sterile
needle and collecting the yellow hemolymph (“blood”),
ensuring no white floccular material was removed—this is the
fat body and will impede counting. Hemolymph was diluted to 1 in 10
in cold PBS containing 0.37% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol to reduce clotting
and melanization. The solution was mixed gently by pipetting. Hemocytes
were counted on a hemocytometer (0.0025 mm2, BLAUBRAND,
Germany), and the density in the original larvae was calculated.21

4.17 ADME Profiling
A computational study
to predict ADME properties of the synthesized compounds (5a–x and 7a–j) was performed using QikProp version
3.2, Schrödinger software. Various physicochemical significant
descriptors as well as pharmacokinetically relevant properties such
as molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond acceptors/donors, NRBs,
aqueous solubility, brain/blood partition coefficient, binding to
human serum albumin, and % human oral absorption of the compounds
were evaluated. In particular, Lipinski’s rule of 5 was compiled
for all synthesized compounds, which is widely used as a filter to
identify easily bioavailable drugs. Moreover, QikProp provides ranges
to compare molecule properties with those of 95% of known drugs.24
