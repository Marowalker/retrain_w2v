The effect of Cs-incorporated NiOx on
perovskite solar cells with an inverted structure was investigated,
where NiOx and PCBM were used as selective
contacts for holes and electrons, respectively. It was found that
the generation of an Ni phase in an NiOx layer was significantly suppressed by employing cesium. Furthermore,
Cs-incorporated NiOx enabled holes to
be efficiently separated at the interface, showing the improved photoluminescent
quenching and thus generating higher short-circuit current. The effect
of Cs incorporation was also prominent in the inhibition of recombination.
The recombination resistance of Cs-incorporated NiOx was noticeably increased by more than three-fold near the
maximum power point, leading to a higher fill factor of 0.78 and consequently
a higher power conversion efficiency of 17.2% for the device employing
Cs-incorporated NiOx.

Introduction
Since 2012, the perovskite solar cells unexpectedly have been attracting interest owing to
their remarkable potential for high efficiency and stability,1,2 and intensive studies on perovskite solar cells have been extensively
carried out, leading to outstanding achievements in terms of efficiency,
stability, and understanding of underlying mechanisms. Various methods
have been successfully developed to enhance the quality of the perovskite
layer by controlling the film growth.3−8 Among them, the adduct8 and the antisolvent4 methods became the two most popular methods for
the current technology of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.
Furthermore, multiple cations, such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), cesium (Cs+), and rubidium
(Rb+), were efficiently incorporated into the perovskite
to stabilize its phase as well as to achieve the high efficiency of
21.6%.9 The most common perovskite configuration
which has been intensively studied is the normal structure based on
TiO2 as an electron transport layer and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis
(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-MeOTAD) as a hole transport layer. Even though the perovskite
device with a TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD structure is
the one used in the efficiency chart,10 it still has certain problems to be solved. It was found that those
selective contacts, TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD, coupled with
halide perovskites, induced time-dependent behaviors,11−16 which are sufficiently observable in the range of solar cell operation,
such as I–V hysteresis11−14 and/or interfacial dynamics related to the ion migration from the
perovskite bulk layer.13−16 These complicating mechanisms at the interface are not fully understood
and also imply the negative effect on long-term stability.16,17 Also, spiro-MeOTAD itself is easily crystallized at high temperatures,18,19 underlying limitations on future commercial development. Unlike
the normal structure, the inverted structure employing NiOx and [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl
ester (PCBM) as hole and electron selective contacts demonstrated
superb air and thermal stability18 with
hysteresis-free characteristics based on its fast response time.14 Besides, many efforts have been made on achieving
high efficiency close to that of the normal structure.20−22 Since the initial works on the inverted structure with NiOx and PCBM in 2014 to replace unstable organic hole
transport layers and obtain better energy level alignment,23−25 Mg and Li co-doping was tried to increase the conductivity of NiOx as well as tune the band alignment with
perovskites, which resulted in a power conversion efficiency (PCE)
of 16.2%.20 Cu-doped NiOx was also reported and demonstrated 17.8% of perovskite solar
cells because of its high crystallinity and improved conductivity.21 Nevertheless, a few papers were published compared to the normal structure where
every single selective contact was carefully engineered to enhance
the performance. In this study, cesium is employed in the NiOx layer to improve the performance of the
inverted perovskite solar cells. The effect of cesium is investigated
in respect of the inhibition of Ni phase formation in the NiOx bulk layer as well as the efficient charge-transfer
behavior at the NiOx/perovskite interface.
In the end, both aspects are closely related to the photovoltaic performance.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of NiOx and Cs-incorporated NiOx powders. To
collect the powders for XRD measurements, the NiOx precursor solutions were prepared and heated in the same manner
as the NiOx layer for devices. XRD peaks
shown at 37.18°, 43.25°, and 62.86° (blue vertical
lines in Figure 1a)
correspond respectively to (111), (200), and (220) planes of the NiO
phase according to JCPDS (22-1189). It is noted that an Ni metal phase
is observed from the NiOx sample at 44.5°
and 51.8° (red vertical lines in Figure 1a) corresponding to (111) and (200) planes
for Ni.26 A ratio quantification of Ni
to NiO was obtained by the Rietveld refinement, showing a ratio of
0.16:0.84. Interestingly, the Ni impurity is significantly suppressed
by employing 1 mol % cesium in the precursor solution (Cs/NiOx). It was confirmed by the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), showing that 0.7 at. % Cs was included
in NiOx. The ionic radii of Ni2+and Cs+ were found to be 0.69 and 1.67 Å, respectively.27,28 When considering the large size difference between them, it is difficult
to substitute Cs+ for Ni2+ as in the general
Li+ doping. Nevertheless, cesium nickel oxide, Cs0.1NiO2, has the same crystal system and space group as NiO
(Table S1), which suggests that a small
amount of Cs might occupy Ni vacancies and be incorporated to the
NiOx lattice. Because the error range
for the XRD measurement used in this study is within 2θ ≤
±0.0065°, the peak shift from 43.31° to 43.28°
indicates the slight increase of the lattice parameter due to the
larger size of Cs+ compared to the Ni2+. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of nickel oxide are shown
in Figure 1b, where
peaks near 872 and 854 eV are attributed to Ni 2p2/1 and
Ni 2p3/2, respectively. Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra
incorporate Ni2+ at 854.5 eV and Ni3+ at 855.8
eV for both NiOx and Cs-incorporated NiOx (Cs/NiOx),29 which implies that both NiO and Ni2O3 phases are mixed in nickel oxide irrespective of Cs
incorporation. It is noted that Ni0 at 852.9 eV is not
clearly seen in Ni 2p3/2 XPS spectra for NiOx employing the Ni phase (Figure 1a), suggesting that the Ni phase is formed
from bulk NiOx and leaves the oxidized
form (NiOx) on the surface. In Figure S1, the Ni0 peak is observed
from the NiOx sample after milling, indicating
the presence of Ni0 inside bulk. In Figure 1c, XPS peaks corresponding to Cs 3d3/2 (738.4 eV) and Cs 3d5/2 (724.6 eV) are clearly observed
from Cs/NiOx, while NiOx shows the absence of Cs 3d spectra.30 The XPS result of Cs/NiOx indicates
that 0.8 at. % Cs is incorporated in NiOx, which is consistent with the estimation from EDXS (0.7 at. %).

The sample was prepared as a powder in the same manner as for the
film. Black and red lines indicate NiOx and Cs/NiOx, respectively.

A 25 nm thick dense NiOx film was prepared
by a solution process and employed in the device. The morphologies
of the NiOx and Cs-incorporated NiOx films on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
glass are shown in Figure S2. It is found
that the Cs-incorporated NiOx layer (Figure S2b) results in more rough surface morphology
compared to the NiOx layer (Figure S2a). However, it makes little difference
in the perovskite morphology whether the perovskite is grown on NiOx (Figure S2c)
or on Cs-incorporated NiOx (Figure S2d). Both perovskite films deposited
by the antisolvent method9 produce flat
and large grain whose size ranges from 50 to 400 nm.

Perovskite
films deposited on the NiOx and Cs-incorporated
NiOx substrates
showed similar absorbance spectra, which are shown in Figure 2a, indicating a negligible
difference in light harvesting efficiency. Photoluminescence (PL)
was measured for perovskite films to investigate the effect of the
NiOx layer on charge separation. For perovskites,
450 nm was used as an excitation wavelength, and the incidence was
made from the FTO/NiOx (glass) side for
steady-state PL. PL spectra of the perovskite film deposited on the
glass substrate without any quenching layer are shown in Figure S2a. The radiative recombination is mainly
determined by the band gap energy, leading to a large emission at
750 nm which corresponds to the band gap of the perovskite. The PL
peak at 680 nm comes from the FTO glass itself (Figure S3b). In Figure 2b, the perovskite attached to the NiOx layer shows a significantly decreased PL at 750 nm, which
is attributed to the carrier injection to the adjacent selective contact
inhibiting the radiative recombination in the material. NiOx is used as a hole selective contact and is responsible
for hole separation. Noticeably, perovskites with the NiOx layer still showed a clear peak at 750 nm because
of the remaining hole carriers in the perovskites. It is found that
Cs-incorporated NiOx enables holes to
be separated more efficiently, diminishing the PL intensity at 750
nm even more than bare NiOx (Figure 2b).

PL spectra of the perovskite film deposited

film based on the glass (gray), FTO/NiOx (black), and FTO/Cs-incorporated NiOx (red) substrates with fitted curves.

Time-resolved PL (TR-PL) measurements were carried out to
have
more insight on the Cs-doping effect. TR-PL spectra of perovskite
films with different substrates are shown in Figure 2c. A 408 nm single wavelength was used as
an excitation source, and 750 nm of wavelength was monitored as a
result of recombination. The TR-PL spectra were fitted to estimate
the PL life time quantitatively by using one- or two-component exponential
decay.31,32 The fitting results and the estimated values
from fittings are shown in Figure 2c and Table 1. For the perovskite film without NiOx, a one-component exponential decay fit well to the results,
indicating that a first order is dominant in the perovskite layer
itself. However, the one-exponential decay brought a considerable
discrepancy in the case of the perovskite film with the NiOx (Cs/NiOx) substrate,
where a two-component exponential decay was used to fit the results.
While the slow decay component (τ1) is still found
in a comparable range with the one observed from the bare perovskite
film, the fast decay component (τ2) is newly developed
by attaching the quenching layer. Consequently, the slow decay component
(τ1) is mostly determined by the recombination of
carriers in the perovskite,31,32 and the fast decay
component (τ2) is affected by quenching of the carriers32 because of the hole selective contact (NiOx) in this study. As expected, the perovskite
film on the glass without any quenching layer has the longest τ1 of 349.1 ns. Adding the NiOx layer
to the perovskite film generates the fast decay component (τ2) of 58.0 ns because of the effective hole quenching at the
interface, which seems to have an effect on free carrier recombination
in bulk perovskites with a shortening of τ1 to 263.4
nm. The shortened τ1 could be attributed to the increased
electron density in the vicinity of the hole selective contact, which
can sufficiently facilitate the recombination near the contact. Both
decay components are even more reduced to 146.5 ns for τ1 and to 32.5 ns for τ2 by employing Cs into
NiOx, indicating that the hole transfer
at the interface becomes more accelerated for Cs/NiOx. The observed improved hole separation could be ascribed to
either the increased interface area (Figure S2b) or the removal of the Ni phase by Cs incorporation.

Table 1 Carrier Life Time of Perovskite Films
According to the TR-PL Fitting with Exponential Decay
time component	perovskite
(ns)	NiOx/perovskite (ns)	Cs/NiOx/perovskite (ns)	
τ1	349.1	262.4	146.5	
τ2	 	58.0	32.5	
We found that employing Cs into NiOx leads to more efficient hole injection at the interface according
to PL data. In terms of charge collection, the charge transfer in
the selective contact medium itself should be considered at the same
time. The resistivity is increased from 8.1 × 104 Ω
cm for NiOx to 15.2 × 104 Ω cm for Cs/NiOx. The increase
in resistivity can be attributed to the synthesis method,33,34 the formation of secondary phases,35 or
to scattering effects35 as reported earlier
for Li-doped NiOx. Although there are
no electrical properties available for Cs0.1NiO2 or Cs2NiO2, taking into account that Cs2O is a n-type semiconductor and Cs2O2 is an insulator,36,37 the inclusion of Cs into NiOx could reduce the p-type conductivity and
thus increase the resistivity. However, the slight increase in resistivity
by Cs incorporation seems unlikely to exceed other beneficial effects
by Cs incorporation.

The photovoltaic performance was measured
based on the inverted
structure, where NiOx or Cs/NiOx was employed as the hole transport material, and
PCBM was used as the electron transport material (inset of Figure 3a). Figure 3a shows the I–V curves for the perovskite solar cells
with NiOx and Cs/NiOx, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. The statistical
photovoltaic parameters are shown in Figure S4 and Table S2. The I–V curves were obtained with a forward scan from open circuit
to short circuit. Both devices show a hysteresis-free behavior even
with 1 ms for the voltage settling time, as shown in Figure S5, indicating that the steady-state condition is rapidly
reached. The device with Cs/NiOx demonstrates
a higher PCE of 17.2% (15.9% for average) than that of 15.3% (13.8%
for average) for the NiOx, mainly because
of the higher short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF). The Cs/NiOx device shows 21.4 mA/cm2 of Jsc and 0.78 of FF, whereas 20.4 mA/cm2 of Jsc and 0.72 of FF are obtained from the NiOx device. Considering the fact that the light
absorbance is comparable for both films (Figure 2a), the efficient and fast charge injection
from the perovskite to the hole selective contact is dominantly responsible
for the higher Jsc for Cs/NiOx according to PL results (Figure 2b,c).

 	Jsc (mA/cm2)	Voc (V)	FF	PCE (%)	
NiOx	20.4	1.04	0.72	15.3	
Cs/NiOx	21.4	1.03	0.78	17.2	
In Figure 3b,c,
the dependence of photocurrent density at the maximum power point
(Jmpp) and the corresponding evolution
of PCE with time are shown. Jmpp is a
good indicator for the FF. The Cs/NiOx device with a higher FF obviously demonstrated higher Jmpp. It is noted that both inverted devices show a stable
behavior once they reach the saturation point. It is clearly contrary
to the behavior of the normal structure whose PCE often gradually
goes down after reaching the highest PCE. It must be related to the
charge-transfer mechanism at the interface with the selective contact.
The understanding of the detailed mechanism is beyond the scope of
the current study and will be handled separately. The saturated Jmpp reaches 19.7 mA/cm2 for Cs/NiOx and 17.4 mA/cm2 for NiOx (Figure 3b), consequently leading to a PCE of 17.1 and 15.4% for Cs/NiOx and NiOx (Figure 3c), respectively.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed to investigate
the recombination resistance, accounting for FF and Jmpp. The IS measurement was carried out under the illumination
of a white light-emitting diode (LED) with a forward bias ranging
from short-circuit to near-open-circuit voltage. Recently, various
equivalent circuits have been reported to assign each element to unique
characteristics of perovskite solar cells such as ionic movement and
polarization.38−40 However, these are still controversial. In this study,
we used the most common simplified circuit, which is composed of R and R–C circuits
in series. Figure 4 shows the recombination resistance (Rrec) obtained by fitting the Nyquist plot observed from the low frequency
range (Figure S6).41,42 The device with Cs/NiOx shows higher Rrec at 0.0–0.8 V compared to the one
with NiOx. The difference in Rrec is mostly governed by the recombination near the hole
selective contact because the only difference between the two devices
is the NiOx contact. Therefore, the charge
recombination is significantly suppressed by the Cs/NiOx layer with a negligible Ni phase, which could sufficiently
act as a recombination center. Otherwise, the accumulated carriers
due to the low hole extraction by NiOx, compared to Cs/NiOx, can be responsible
for the accelerated recombination in bulk perovskites,42 leading to the low Rrec for NiOx. The difference between Rrec values gradually increases toward the higher
voltage region which determines the FF and Jmpp. However, the Rrec tendency
is reversed near Voc, which seems to be
responsible for the slightly lower Voc for the device with Cs/NiOx, implying
that the Cs incorporation induces a positive shift in the valence
band. The Rrec results are well in accordance
with the photovoltaic parameters.

In conclusion, the effect
of Cs-incorporated NiOx on the performance
of the inverted perovskite solar cells
was studied. An employment of Cs in the NiOx layer was found to effectively suppress the development of
an Ni phase in the NiOx layer. Furthermore,
the Cs-incorporated NiOx layer enabled
holes in perovskites to be efficiently separated and collected, which
significantly impeded the recombination at the interface by lowering
the hole concentration. Consequently, the perovskite solar cells based
on Cs-incorporated NiOx demonstrated higher
PCE mainly because of the higher photocurrent density and FF.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Perovskite Precursor Solution
1.5 M
lead iodide (TCI) was prepared where the solvent was a mixture of
dimethylformamide (DMF, Acros) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Acros)
(DMF/DMSO = 4:1 volume ratio). Formamidinium iodide (Dyesol) was added
to the 1.5 M PbI2 solution with a 9% excess molar ratio
for PbI2. A mixture of 1.5 M lead bromide (TCI) and methylammonium
bromide (Dyesol) was prepared in the same manner as for 9 mol % excess
Pb and mixed solvent. 1.5 M cesium iodide (ABCR, 99.998%) was prepared
with DMSO. To make a perovskite precursor solution based on mixed
triple cations and double halides, the prepared FAPbI3,
MAPbBr3, and CsI solutions were mixed in a ratio of 5:1:0.3.

Preparation of Device
An FTO substrate (Nippon, 10
Ω/sq) was sequentially sonicated for 15 min in a detergent (2%
diluted in DIW, Hellmanex III, Hellma GmbH), DIW, and ethanol. The
cleaned FTO glass was exposed to UV/ozone treatment for 10 min. 0.1
M nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma, 99.999%) in 2-methoxy ethanol
(Roth, 99%) was deposited on the FTO glass using spin-coating at 4000
rpm for 20 s, which was followed by heating at 500 °C for 1 h
with an increasing temperature rate of 16 °C/min. A closed box
furnace without any gas flow was used for the annealing process. In
the case of the cesium-mixed nickel precursor solution, cesium nitrate
(Acros, 99.99%) was added to the nickel solution according to the
required atomic ratio. The prepared perovskite solution was deposited
on the NiOx substrate using an antisolvent
method.9 Briefly, 100 μL of chlorobenzene
(Aldrich) was dropped on the substrate at the end of spinning (10
s before termination) of the perovskite precursor solution. The substrate
coated with the perovskite precursor solution was heated at 100 °C
for 50 min to be converted into the perovskite black phase. A PCBM
(1-material) solution (20 mg/1 mL chlorobenzene) was deposited on
the cooled down perovskite substrate by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for
30 s. Post-heat treatment for PCBM was carried out at 100 °C
for 10 min. A bathocuproine (BCP, TCI, 98.0%) solution (0.5 mg/1 mL
ethanol) was deposited for the hole blocking layer on the top of annealed
PCBM using a spin-coater with 6000 rpm for 20 s. Gold was evaporated
to make a ca. 75 nm-thick top electrode at 10–6 Torr.
All the spin-coating procedures including perovskites, PCBM, and BCP
were carried out in the glovebox filled with dry air.

Measurement
Current–voltage (I–V) curves and maximum power tracking were
measured by a solar simulator (Oriel, OPS-A500) equipped with a 450
W xenon light source. A Schott K113 Tempax filter (PräzisionsGlas
& Optik GmbH) was used to reduce the mismatch between the Xe lamp
and a standard AM 1.5G light spectrum. A calibration for the light
intensity was carried out prior to each measurement by the aid of
a silicon reference cell equipped with an IR-cutoff
filter (KG3, Schott). IS measurements were performed by a potentiostat
(BioLogic, MPG 2) under a white LED light source. dc bias voltage
was given from 0 to 0.8 V with a potential step of 100 mV. Sinusoidal
ac voltage (20 mV) ranging from 1 MHz to 1 Hz was put on the dc voltage.
The measured data were fitted using ZView software with a simplified
equivalent circuit composed of resistance (R) and
three R–C (resistance and
capacitance in parallel) components in series. The recombination resistance
was obtained from the last R–C component corresponding to the low frequency. To avoid scattering
effects of the glass substrate, an aperture with the black metal was
attached to the device during all measurements (I–V, maximum power point tracking and IS)
under illumination. The active area for the devices was 0.16 cm2. Absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed with
a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer (Cary5, Varian). PL was
measured by Fluorolog 322 (Horiba JobinYbon Ltd.). For the steady-state
PL measurement, a wavelength of 450 nm was used for the excitation.
For TR-PL, a single wavelength of 408 nm (N-405 L, Horiba) with 1
MHz was used for the excitation, and the resulting TR-PL was monitored
at 750 nm. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and
EDXS were measured by ZEISS Merlin. XRD of the sample was measured
using an Empyrean (PANalytical) instrument equipped with a ceramic
tube (Cu anode, λ = 1.54060 Å) and PIXel1D (PANalytical).
XRD data were analyzed using HighScore Plus software. HR-SEM images
were obtained by ZEISS Merlin. XPS measurements were carried out using
a PHI VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe (Physical Instruments
AG, Germany). The samples for XRD and XPS measurements were prepared
as powders by using the same precursor solutions for the NiOx films. The precursor solution was coated on the
large glass substrate and annealed in the same manner as for the NiOx film. After the annealing process, the products
were removed from the glass substrate and collected as powders. The
conductivity study was made by a Precision LCR Meter (Agilent E4980A)
at room temperature in ambient air.
