Extracts were extricated
from raw okara and okara fermented with Rhizopus oligosporus using a clean, green protocol;
water was used as the extraction solvent and coupled with ultrasound
assistance for enhanced extraction. In vitro anti-oxidant analyses
for antioxidant potential and capacity, superoxide scavenging activity,
and nitric oxide scavenging activity validated that fermented okara
yielded superior bioactive performance compared to raw okara. Fermented
okara extracts showed no toxicity to erythrocytes and successfully
prevented induced haemolysis. After 48 h incubation at the highest
tested concentration (100 mg/mL), fermented okara extracts could inhibit
HepG2 cells by 48.47 ± 5.28%, which was significantly different
from their effects on NIH 3T3 cells. Gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry characterization of extracts validated amino acids to
be the chief fraction responsible for the detected bioactivity of
the fermented okara extract. The results derived in this study open
up the possibility that biofermented okara extract may be a potential
novel sustainable nutraceutical.

1 Introduction
Okara, a prime agri-waste,
is the insoluble waste residue generated
by soybean processing industries. As it is highly perishable because
of its high moisture content, its standard discard methods include
incineration and disposal in landfills. However, there exists a potential
for recycling and reusing fresh okara, as it has been proven to encompass
a variety of nutrients. According to Li et al.,1 per 100 g of dry matter raw okara possesses a protein content
of 25.4–28.4 g, fat content of 9.3–10.9 g, dietary fibre
content of 52.8–58.1 g, and carbohydrate content of 3.8–5.3
g. van der Riet et al.2 observed that okara
also contains several important minerals and vitamins as well. Further,
raw okara also has a low calorific value.3

In recent times, solid-state fermentation has garnered a lot
of
attention for its ability to economically bulk-produce enzymes, organic
acids, and bioactive secondary metabolites using industrial agro-wastes
as substrates. It is also a viable valorization treatment technique
to enrich the nutritional content of the substrate through microbial
activity.4−7 Currently, there is a growing awareness to curb the usage of petrochemical
solvents for extraction purposes. This is because most of the organic
solvents are toxic, volatile, flammable, and contribute to environmental
pollution and greenhouse effect. Water, being polar, is suitable for
the extraction of natural water-soluble products such as flavonoids.
An added benefit is that easy manipulation of its dielectric constant
is possible through modulating temperature and pressure. This allows
water to even be used as an extraction solvent for compounds possessing
low polarity.8 Ultrasound is a clean, green
method for extraction of compounds of commercial importance, including
but not limited to polysaccharides, proteins, and bioactive molecules.
Its ease of use, versatility, and nontoxicity make it a popular economic
option in the quest for sustainable green technology extraction methods.9

Liver cancer may be triggered by several
factors, notable of which
include chronic hepatitis B and C infection and exposure to aflatoxins.
Hepatocellular carcinoma poses a major challenge to the healthcare
sector; there is a persistent quest for finding a safe, efficient
economic medication, with little or negligible side effects.

Today, there is a lot of focus on discovering natural healthcare
products in order to avoid the various side effects caused by the
consumption of synthetic antioxidants. This paper has detailed the
investigation of in vitro antioxidant and antiproliferative assays
carried out using an extract sourced from okara fermented with Rhizopus oligosporus, an FDA-approved, GRAS (generally
recognized as safe) food-grade fungus using a clean, green method.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Antioxidant Analyses
Oxidative stress
is responsible for a plethora of serious health concerns. Biofermentation
of okara using R. oligosporus, an FDA-approved,
food-grade GRAS microbe, was expected to contribute positive nutritional
enhancements in conjecture with the work carried out by Gupta et al.10 Natural antioxidants, as evaluated in our study,
have the advantage of not having the side effects associated with
commercial synthetic antioxidants.

2,2-Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) assay is one of the most commonly used assays for testing radical
scavenging activities (RSA) of samples. Antioxidants are able to quench
the stable DPPH radical (dark purple) to its nonradical stable form
(colourless) as a measure of their free radical scavenging potential. Figure 1a demonstrates the
antioxidant potential of dose-dependent fermented and unfermented
okara extracts against a positive control of quercetin. As is evident
from the results obtained, fermented okara extracts possess significantly
higher scavenging activities as compared to unfermented okara extracts
at the same concentrations. However, the activities of fermented okara
extracts were lesser than the activities of quercetin at the respective
concentrations. The results of this experiment warranted a deeper
investigation of the antioxidant potential of the fermented okara
extract using different antioxidant tests [ferric reducing antioxidant
power (FRAP), superoxide radical scavenging activity (O2–) and nitric oxide radical scavenging activity
(•NO)].

Figure 1 (a) DPPH radical scavenging potential of raw
and fermented okara

significant difference between groups at a particular concentration).
(b) FRAP potential of raw and fermented okara (n =

different letters represent significant difference between groups
at a particular concentration). (d) Nitric oxide RSA of raw and fermented
okara (n = 3; alphabets with different letters represent
significant difference between groups at a particular concentration).

The results of FRAP assay to estimate antioxidant
capacity of fermented
okara have been illustrated in Figure 1b. The reducing power of the extracts was studied as
a function of their concentration. The mechanism of FRAP is based
solely on electron transfer; the ability of the extracts to reduce
Fe3+ to Fe2+ by electron donation was taken
as a representation of the potential of the corresponding compound
to reduce free radicals in plasma and tissues, thereby modulating
the redox state. As seen in Figure 1b, the antioxidant capacities of fermented okara extracts
far surpassed those of unfermented okara extracts at their respective
equivalent concentrations. However, fermented okara extracts remained
less efficient when compared with standard antioxidant quercetin.
Nevertheless, the results of this experiment confirmed the presence
of preliminary antioxidant activity in fermented okara extracts.

Superoxide anions generated from dissolved oxygen in a riboflavin-light-nitro
blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) system can reduce NBT in the system.
In the absence of any antioxidant activity, superoxides can reduce
the yellow dye (NBT2+) to produce formazan. Antioxidants
can prevent this activity. As perceptible from Figure 1c, the superoxide inhibitory activity of
extracts rose with increase in concentration of extracts. Fermented
okara extracts yielded better results than raw okara extracts. Superoxide
scavenging potential is widely relevant to the biological system as
superoxides are capable of reducing certain iron complexes (e.g.,
cytochrome c), causing peroxidation of lipids and
generating singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that react with biomacromolecules
and thereby induce tissue damage.11

In the reaction system used for evaluating nitric oxide scavenging
activity, nitric oxide is generated from sodium nitroprusside (SNP)
and reacts with oxygen to form nitrite. The nitrite ions subsequently
react with the components of the Griess reagent by diazotizing sulphanilamide
and coupling with napthylethylediamine. These reactions produce a
pink color, the formation of which is inhibited when antioxidants
scavenge the free radicals. As conspicuous from Figure 1d, the nitric oxide inhibitory activity of
extracts intensified with increase in concentration of extracts. Once
again, fermented okara extracts yielded better results than raw okara
extracts. Nitric oxide scavenging activity is of immense importance
to the healthcare industry. Biologically, chronic exposure to nitric
oxide has been linked to various carcinomas and inflammatory conditions
including juvenile diabetes, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and ulcerative
colitis.12 Nitric oxide toxicity increases
exponentially when it reacts with superoxide radicals to form the
highly reactive peroxynitrite anion (ONOO–).

Table 1 depicts
the correlation between the different antioxidant analyses for fermented
okara extracts. As is evident from the high correlation coefficients
(R2 > 0.5), there exists a strong correlation
between the different assays performed for evaluation of antioxidant
capacities.

2.2 Erythrocyte Lysis Assays
The erythrocyte
toxicity assay [Figure 2a] proved that unfermented okara extracts may be considered toxic
at concentrations higher than 2 mg/mL. However, fermented okara extracts
were observed to be nontoxic to erythrocytes at concentrations even
as high as 4 mg/mL. Hence, haemolysis inhibition assay was carried
out with the fermented okara extract, to further study its effect
on erythrocyte cells.

Figure 2 (a) Erythrocyte toxicity assay using unfermented and fermented
okara extracts (n = 3). (b) (i) Percentage of AAPH-induced
haemolysis of erythrocytes in the presence of fermented okara extracts
(n = 3). (ii) Percentage of inhibition of AAPH-induced
haemolysis of erythrocytes in the presence of fermented okara extracts
(n = 3).

2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) generates
free radicals and attacks erythrocytes to induce chain oxidation of
proteins and lipids, ultimately leading to haemolysis. As seen from Figure 2b, fermented okara
extracts were able to prevent AAPH-induced haemolysis of erythrocyte
cells in a dose-dependent manner. On carrying out a t-test, no significant differences were observed between the percentage
haemolysis inhibitions at the highest and lowest concentrations of
tested fermented okara extract. This attests that even at concentrations
as low as 500 ng/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), fermented
okara extract is able to prevent AAPH-induced lysis of red blood cells.

2.3 Antiproliferative Assay
Cancer is
believed to be a result of reactive oxygen species inducing oxidative
damage to biomolecules such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and
DNA. According to Sun,13 free radicals
are involved in both the establishment and propagation of multistage
carcinogenesis. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and are therefore
considered to be potential anticarcinogens. The results obtained from
our antioxidant analyses [Figure 1a–d] gave rise to a strong hypothesis that fermented
okara extracts would be able to exhibit antiproliferative activities
in cancer cell lines. Recent research has been focused on identification
of anticancer agents from soybean.

Figure 3a(i),(ii) exhibit a section of HepG2 cells
before and after the extract treatment, respectively. To comparatively
ascertain the effects of fermented and unfermented okara extract treatments
on HepG2 and NIH 3T3 cells, contour plots were created [Figure 3b(i),(ii)] that illustrate
the range of viability changes that occurred in both HepG2 and NIH
3T3 cell lines as a function of extract concentration and time. In
both figures, it could be seen that at lower concentrations, the extracts
were able to induce cell proliferation, thereby resulting in viability
above control cells. This may be explained by the hypothesis that
at low concentrations, some drugs are capable of upregulating the
viability of cancer cells by accelerating cell proliferation and decreasing
apoptosis.14 It is clear from Figure 3b that fermented
okara extracts induced greater loss of viability as opposed to unfermented
okara extracts. As may be observed from Figure 3b(i), there was not a significant decrease
in viability in HepG2 cells after treatment for 24 h. The treatment
for 48 h showed a much more favorable response, as evidenced by Figure 3b(ii); viability
of HepG2 steadily decreased with analogous increase in concentration
of the fermented extract. It may be postulated from this study that
the viability losses were due to apoptosis and necrosis mechanisms,
triggered by the extracts.

Figure 3 (a) (i) Live HepG2 cells (before treatment).
(ii) Dead HepG2 cells
(after treatment). (i) Contour plot representing viability of cell
lines after 24 h extract treatment. Key: HepG2 treated with unfermented
okara extract (HepG2 UF); HepG2 treated with fermented okara extract
(HepG2 F); NIH 3T3 treated with unfermented okara extract (3T3 UF);
NIH 3T3 treated with fermented okara extract (3T3 F). (ii) Contour
plot representing viability of cell lines after 48 h extract treatment.
Key: HepG2 treated with unfermented okara extract (HepG2 UF); HepG2
treated with fermented okara extract (HepG2 F); NIH 3T3 treated with
unfermented okara extract (3T3 UF); NIH 3T3 treated with fermented
okara extract (3T3 F). (c) Increased inhibition of the HepG2 cell
line after 48 hours treatment with increase in concentration-fermented
okara extract; (i) 25 mg/mL extract; (ii) 50 mg/mL extract; (iii)
75 mg/mL extract; and (iv) 100 mg/mL extract.

Although from Figure 3b(ii), it is evident that the viability differed significantly across
the cell lines with respect to the extract treatment, statistical
analyses tools were employed to gauge the levels of similarity or
unsimilarity. A paired t-test analysis was thus carried
out (Table 2). As may
be observed, the results validate the implications generated by Figure 3b(ii). Because higher
concentration of fermented okara extract yielded desirable inhibition
of viability in the HepG2 cell line after 48 h incubation, a comparative
analysis was made to justify the usage of the same. It was noted that
at corresponding concentrations, a significant difference existed
between HepG2 cells treated with fermented extracts versus treated
with unfermented extracts. Except for the lowest concentration tested,
at all other extract concentrations, the p-values
were lesser than 0.05. A similar trend was observed on comparing the
effects of parallel concentrations of fermented extract on HepG2 cells
versus NIH 3T3 cells; except for the lowest concentration tested,
at all other extract concentrations, the p-values
were lesser than 0.05, thereby indicating significant difference in
the viability percentages (Table 2). Thus, it may be stated from the results obtained
that the treatment with fermented okara extracts could induce better
reduction in the viability of cancer cell line HepG2 as opposed to
the treatment with unfermented extracts but had not as great an effect
on normal cells NIH 3T3 at analogous concentrations, thereby implying
its nontoxicity on normal cells.

Figure 3c displays
a stacked column analysis of the variation in inhibition across the
four highest concentrations of fermented okara extracts tested on
HepG2 and NIH 3T3 cell lines after 48 h incubation. As may be observed
from Figure 3c(i–iv),
the percentages of inhibition rise with increase in concentrations
of extract used for the treatment. There was an inhibition of 18.49
± 3.43, 42.07 ± 3.35, 44.47 ± 5.6, and 48.47 ±
5.28% in HepG2 viability, on treating cells with a dose of 25, 50,
75, and 100 mg/mL, respectively. Conversely, NIH 3T3 cells remained
less affected by the extract treatment; loss of viability was 0 ±
7.49, 17.28 ± 7.59, 25.81 ± 2.69, and 30.11 ± 2.73%
for treatment doses of 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/mL, respectively. The
results obtained heighten the possibility that increasing the incubation
time would elicit greater inhibitory response against the tested cancer
cell line, at parallel concentrations of the extract treatment. In
tandem with our present results, it would be a valid hypothesis that
the corresponding treatment would not have a significant effect on
normal cell lines.

2.4 Characterization of Extracts
Using Gas Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry
A gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) metabolomics approach was used to characterize the
extracts used in the antioxidant and antiproliferative analyses, to
investigate the bioactive components responsible for the activities.
Clearly separated compounds with high abundance have been indicated
in Figure 4a,b. The
compounds identified were grouped into three parent groups: amino
acids, organic acids, and sugars (Table 3). Four essential (valine, tryptophan, leucine,
and threonine) and four nonessential (alanine, glycine, serine, and
proline) amino acids were detected. Further, as seen from Figure 4a,b, there exists
a marked difference in the metabolomic output between fermented and
unfermented okara extracts. Hence, a PCA biplot [Figure 4c] was generated to validate
the variance between the unfermented and fermented samples. The GC–MS
data were analyzed using a correlation matrix with listwise exclusion.
The first two principal components (PC), PC1 and PC2, attributed to
91.45 and 6.82% of variance, respectively, and thus cumulatively accounted
for 98.27% of the total variance. PC1 being the larger PC, it may
be interpreted that the distribution pattern of metabolites detected
in unfermented and fermented extracts were significantly different.

The fold-change of characterized
compounds after fermentation has
been documented in Figure 5. As may be observed, fermented okara extracts contained significantly
increased levels of amino acids and organic acids. On the other hand,
sugar concentration seemed to chiefly decrease after fermentation.
This may be attributed to microbial bioactivity breaking down complex
proteins into their constituent amino acids, while using basic sugars
as nutrition.

Figure 5 Fold change in selected metabolites after fermentation
of okara
with R. oligosporus.

2.5 Link of Characterized Metabolites with Bioactivity
High levels of sugars are associated with metastasis of malignant
cancer. Glucose formed by glycolysis, along with glutamine is able
to generate the carbon skeletons, NADPH, and ATP to serve as the building
blocks for new cancer cells. These cancer cells are able to survive
in hypoxial conditions and subsequently modify the metabolic pathways
for cell growth and survival, thus leading to malignancy.15

Butanedioic acid, commonly known as succinic
acid, has been studied to have an effect on antioxidant capacities
and has been suggested in its implementation as an effective preventive
antioxidant.16 Further, it has been observed
to increase the activities of several enzymes including superoxide
dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase,17 all
of which are vital plasma antioxidant enzymes.

Amino acids play
an essential role in the maintenance of cancer
redox homeostasis. Proline is a well-known stress adaptor molecule.
Its metabolism influences various cell signaling pathways, thereby
playing a crucial role in triggering tumor suppression and cell survival
in animals.18 Further, work carried out
by Vaughan et al.19 documented that alanine
is capable of suppressing tumour cells. Dietary threonine has been
documented to improve levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and
glutathione peroxidase and complement components C3 and C4.20 Studies indicate that branched-chain amino acids,
including valine and leucine, elicit NO scavenging biofunctional responses
and inhibit lipid peroxidation.21 Nayak
and Buttar22 observed that tryptophan too
possesses antioxidant and antiproliferative properties. The bioactivity
of serine was observed by Maralani et al.23 through the elevation of several antioxidant factors. Oral administration
of glycine has been shown to reduce oxidative stress.24

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
it may be summarized that this work holds substantial
potential for employing biofermented okara as a sustainable functional
food. Previous studies carried out10 documented
that biofermentation proved to not only increase the quantity of several
important compounds (amino acids, fatty acids, tastants and so forth.)
but also to generate an increase in antioxidant activity. Further,
the effect of the extracts on HepG2 and NIH 3T3 cell lines revealed
the possibility of utilization of the fermented okara extract as a
potent nutraceutical, as with increased incubation time and at particular
concentrations, a greater, more significant loss of viability was
noticed in HepG2 cells as compared to NIH 3T3 cells. An important
criterion of our study was to propose the extraction of bioactive
fractions using green technology. Lastly, characterization of the
extracts revealed amino acids to be the chief group of bioactive compounds
in the fermented okara extract. This is in tandem with our bioactivity
studies as Marcuse25 suggested that amino
acids have antioxidant activities and Bonfili, et al.26 observed that essential amino acids can activate apoptosis
in cancer cells.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials, Microorganisms, and Cells
Fresh okara was
obtained from Unicurd Food Company Pte Ltd (Singapore)
and stored at −80 °C until used. Fungal strain R. oligosporus (DSM 1964) was procured from the Leibniz
Institute DSMZ German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Cultures.
Fresh single human donor (female) blood stored in CPDA-1 was used
for the erythrocyte assays. Cell lines HepG2 and NIH 3T3 were bought
from ATCC. All chemicals and media were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).

4.2 Fermentation and Extract
Preparation
A quantity of 10 g of fresh okara was inoculated
with a culture inoculum
of 105 CFU R. oligosporus and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. For extraction of phytocompounds,
1 g of the fermented sample (procedure repeated for unfermented sample)
was added to 7 mL of the extraction solvent (water), macerated and
ultrasonicated for 10 min. The crude mixture was then incubated at
40 °C in the shaking condition for 4 h, following which it was
centrifuged at 10 000g for 15 min. The supernatant
was used as the extract for all antioxidant assays. For antiproliferative
assays, the supernatant was freeze-dried, redissolved in PBS, and
filtered using 0.45 μM filter prior to treating the cell lines.

4.3 DPPH Antioxidant Assay
A DPPH antioxidant
assay was carried out using the protocol employed by Gupta et al.10 with minor modifications. DPPH solution (500
μL) (0.6 mM in ethanol) was added to 500 μL of the aqueous
extract at different concentrations. Ethanol (4 mL) was added to this
mixture and the tube incubated in dark for 30 min at room temperature.
Above solution (1 mL) was read for absorbance at 515 nm. Quercetin
was used as the standard.

4.4 FRAP Assay
The
FRAP was calculated
using the methodology employed by Jemli et al.,28 with minor modifications. PBS (2.5 mL) and 2.5 mL 1% K3[Fe(CN)6] were added to 1 mL of the extract (at
different concentrations), and the mixture was incubated at 50 °C
for 20 min. Subsequently, 2.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
was added and the mixture centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. To 2.5
mL of the supernatant, 2.5 mL of distilled water and 2.5 mL of 0.1%
FeCl3 were added and the absorbance measured at 700 nm.
Quercetin was used as the standard.

4.5 Superoxide
Radical (O2–) Scavenging Activity
The O2– scavenging activity of the extracts
were obtained using the procedure
followed by Parimala and Selvan,29 with
minor modifications. To 100 μL of the extract (at different
concentrations), 0.1 mL of 1.5 mM NBT, 0.2 mL of 0.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 0.05 mL of 0.12 mM riboflavin, and 2.55 mL of 0.067 M
PBS were added and the mixture illuminated for 30 min. Absorbance
was then measured at 590 nm. Quercetin was used as the standard.

4.6 Nitric Oxide Radical (•NO)
Scavenging Activity
The •NO scavenging
activity of the extracts were estimated using the methodology employed
by Parimala and Selvan.29 A quantity of
3 mL of 5 mM SNP was added to 200 μL of the extract (at different
concentrations) and the mixture incubated at 25 °C for 150 min.
From this mixture, 1 mL was then removed and added to 1 mL of the
Griess reagent. Absorbance was measured at 546 nm. Quercetin was used
as the standard.

4.7 Erythrocyte Toxicity and
Haemolysis Inhibition
Assays
Erythrocyte toxicity and haemolysis inhibition assays
were performed as described by Cheung et al.,30 with minor modifications.

For the erythrocyte toxicity assay,
100 μL of fresh erythrocytes were added to an Eppendorf tube
containing 300 μL of PBS and 100 μL of sample extracts
at different concentrations. The mixtures were allowed to incubate
for 3 hours at room temperature in a shaking condition at 200 rpm.
Following this, each tube was diluted with 8 mL of PBS and centrifuged
at 1041 g. The supernatant was subsequently read at 540 nm. PBS was
used as blank. PBS and sterile distilled water were used in place
of samples, in the two control tubes, respectively.

The toxicity
was calculated according to the formula  where AS is the
absorbance value of the sample, AP is
the absorbance value of PBS control, and AW is the absorbance value of the water control.

The erythrocyte
haemolysis inhibition assay was carried out in
the same way as the above, except for a minor modification in the
experimental setup. Fresh RBCs (100 μL) were added to an Eppendorf
tube containing 200 μL of PBS, 100 μL of 0.5 M AAPH, and
100 μL of sample extracts at different concentrations. Vitamin
C (100 μL) (0.125 mg/mL) was added in place of the sample in
the control tube.

The haemolysis inhibition was calculated according
to the formula  where AS is the
absorbance value of the sample, AP is
the absorbance value of PBS control, and AW is the absorbance value of the water control.

4.8 Cell Culture, Treatment, and MTT Cell Viability
Assay
Human liver cancer cell line HepG2 and mouse embryo
fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 were grown on Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 till 75–80% confluency was reached. Cells were then seeded
into 96-well microplates, with each well containing 104 cells.

When the wells achieved a confluency of ∼70%,
10 μL of the extract was added to each well (except control
wells) and the microplates incubated for 24 and 48 h. On completion
of their respective incubation periods, the old medium was removed
and an equivalent quantity of the fresh medium was added to each well.
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
solution (10 μL) (12 mM) was added next, followed by incubating
the microplate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 hours. Subsequently,
25 μL of solution was allowed to remain and the rest carefully
removed without disturbing the cell layer at the bottom of the well.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (100 μL) was then added to each well
and mixed thoroughly to dissolve the formazan crystals. The microplate
was then again incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and finally read at 570 nm.

4.9 GC–MS
Analysis of Extract
Sample preparation for GC–MS was
done using the method followed
by Chen and Chen.31 A quantity of 50 μL
of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine was added to 1
mL of the dried sample, vortexed for 1 min, and incubated at 37 °C
for 1 h. Following this, 100 μL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane
was added to the sample. Samples were incubated at 70 °C for
30 min and finally centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 1 hour at
room temperature before being transferred to glass vials for GC–MS
analysis.

All samples for GC–MS were analyzed within
12 h after derivatization. 5975C inert MSD with the Triple-Axis Detector
from Agilent Technologies was used for the process with hexane as
the stationary phase. The capillary column was 0.25 μm thick
and had dimensions of 30 m × 0.250 mm. A quantity of 1 μL
of the sample was injected in the splitless mode; carrier gas helium
was maintained at a purge flow of 50 mL per minute. The inlet was
sustained at an isothermal temperature of 230 °C. The GC oven
was initiated at 75 °C (4 min hold) and ramped to 280 °C
at 4 °C per minute, with a final hold time of 2 min at 280 °C.
Data were acquired in full scan from 30 to 900 m/z. Metabolites were identified using NIST08 mass spectral
library. The chromatographic peaks were normalized according to the
internal standard (ribitol) before being subjected to statistical
analyses.

4.10 Statistical Analysis
All analyses
were carried out in triplicate. Data have been represented as an average
of the three trials. Antioxidant and cell culture assays were subjected
to the t-test, with p < 0.05
being considered significant. GC–MS data were analyzed by the
one-way ANOVA and post-hoc t-test.
