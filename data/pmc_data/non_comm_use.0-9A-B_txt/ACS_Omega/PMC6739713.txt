5-Hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) was used as a sustainable raw material
in the development of a resin-supported boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based
photocatalyst. In the development of the catalyst, the brominated
product (HMF-BODIPY-Br) and photocatalyst (HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc) were
isolated under a chromatography-free condition. The photocatalyst
was loaded on polymeric resin by bridging alcohol functionality in
HMF and amine functionality in polymeric resin using succinic anhydride.
The resin-supported photocatalyst was used in light-mediated C–H
arylation of various heterocycles using aryldiazonium salt. For representative
examples, diazotization and photoarylation were carried out in one
pot, and arylated furans were obtained in very good yields. C–H
arylation was found to proceed via a photogenerated radical intermediate,
and the radical intermediate was trapped by forming an adduct with
TEMPO.

Introduction
The ever-increasing
demand for fossil-sourced energy and chemical
products results in depletion of fossil fuel reserves, impacting environmental
harmony. Intense research is being carried out on developing many
plant-sourced organic matters as energy alternates to be used in internal
combustion engines, for example, ethanol,1 biodiesel,2−4 and 2,5-dimethylfuran.5−7 Considering the demand
for fine chemicals, various HMF-derived chemicals have been utilized
as plant-sourced sustainable raw materials (Table 1).8,9

HMF-derived
2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) has been utilized as a raw
material in accessing pharmaceutical intermediates and antifungal
agents.10−12 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) accessed by oxidation
of HMF is an alternate for fossil-derived terephthalic acid in making
polymers.13−16 2,5-Bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHF) obtained by reduction of HMF is
used as a monomer in the synthesis of polyurethane foams and polyesters.17,18 2,5-Bis(aminomethyl)furan (BAF) is used as a monomer in the synthesis
of polyamides and polyurethanes.19,20 Caprolactone,
an important molecule in polymer industry, can be obtained from HMF.21 HMF-derived 1,6-hexanediol has been utilized
as a monomer in the synthesis of polyurethane foams and polyesters.22,23 HMF can also be utilized in the synthesis of adipic acid, a monomer
utilized in the production of nylon.24 To
date, HMF has been converted into many simple molecules of industrial
importance, including DFF, FDCA, etc.25 The use of HMF in developing complex functional molecules has not
been explored much. Herein, we have taken a step ahead to utilize
HMF beyond its conventional usage of accessing simple molecules. We
have developed a functionalized photocatalyst accessible from sustainable
raw materials such as HMF and 2,4-dimethylpyrrole. The photocatalyst
has been immobilized on polymeric resin to facilitate its complete
recovery after the reaction. The immobilized photocatalyst has been
utilized in light-mediated arylation of various arenes. Recovery and
reusability of the resin-supported photocatalyst have been demonstrated.

Results
and Discussion
Previously, we have developed a facile method
to access HMF from
fructose at room temperature, utilizing silica as a solid support,
mitigating humin formation, and facilitating selective extraction
of HMF.26 Also, we have strategically utilized
2,4-dimethylpyrrole (DMP) in developing a colorimetric naked-eye chemosensor
for copper(II) ions.27,28 Here, we have utilized these
two sustainable raw materials (HMF and DMP) in developing a sustainable
photocatalyst with an objective to mitigate our dependency on fossil-based
chemicals. A retrosynthetic scheme originating from sustainable raw
materials including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), succinic anhydride,
and 2,4-dimethylpyrrole was designed to access the photocatalyst (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Sustainable Raw Materials
Utilized in Synthesis of Photocatalyst
HMF was converted into BODIPY alcohol (HMF-BODIPY) in
a three-step
process (Scheme 2).
In the first step, HMF was converted into corresponding 1,3,7,9-tetramethyl-dipyrromethane
(TM-DPM). The formed TM-DPM was further oxidized into corresponding
dipyrrin using chloranil as an oxidant and then treated with excess
BF3·OEt2 in basic media. All these three
steps are low yielding synthetic steps. On carrying out these three
steps in one pot, HMF-BODIPY was obtained in 5% overall yield. Our
attempts to increase the yield of HMF-BODIPY did not succeed. Hence,
we proceeded further for functionalization of HMF-BODIPY and immobilization
of the photocatalyst on polymeric resin.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of HMF-derived
BODIPY Alcohol
Visible light-mediated
reactions attract considerable attention.29−31 BODIPY derivatives
have been previously utilized as photocatalysts
in various organic transformations.32,33 In general,
bromination of BODIPY increases the population at the triplet excited
state by spin–orbit coupling.34−36 Hence, we have brominated
HMF-BODIPY in positions 2 and 6 using N-bromosuccinimide
under chromatography-free synthesis and obtained HMF-BODIPY-Br in
a quantitative yield (Scheme 3). The byproduct, succinimide, was removed by washing with
water. Then, acid functionality was introduced into HMF-BODIPY-Br
by treating with excess succinic anhydride. Complete consumption of
HMF-BODIPY-Br was confirmed by TLC analysis. Excess succinic anhydride
was removed by washing with warm water. Trituration of the organic
layer with hexanes yielded HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc in pure form (63% yield),
without any chromatographic purification.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc
and Immobilization on Polymeric Resin
The UV–vis spectrum of the photocatalyst showed
maximum
absorption at 545 nm. Coupling reagents that used to immobilize the
photocatalyst on resin did not show any absorption near 545 nm (Supporting Information). Hence, we decided to
utilize this absorption characteristics of HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc (ϵ
= 35,100 M–1 cm–1) to estimate
the extent of loading in the process of immobilization of the photocatalyst
on polymeric resin, aminomethyl polystyrene (Scheme 3). The amino functionality on the resin was
coupled with acid functionality of HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc via an amide
linkage utilizing peptide-coupling reagents. The extent of immobilization
on polymeric resin was calculated based on (i) absorbance of unreacted
HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc present in a reaction medium and (ii) change in
the weight of resin after BODIPY loading.

HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc
shows strong absorption at 545 nm (ϵ =
35,100 M–1 cm–1) in the free state
and after immobilization on polymeric resin (Supporting Information). Hence, we have used green LED, emitting in the
range between 495 and 555 nm with a maximum at 520 nm, as a light
source for photocatalysis (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Emission spectrum of green LED.

The immobilized photocatalyst was utilized in green light-mediated
arylation of heteroarenes and arenes using aryldiazonium salt. Initially,
photoarylation was explored in furan. In a typical experiment, a mixture
of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate, furan, and the photocatalyst in
a solvent was irradiated with green LED at 30 °C for 2 h. We
have observed in a solvent screening study that the yield of the photoarylation
product is directly depending on the solubility of aryldiazonium salt.
4-Bromobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate is completely soluble in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), least soluble in halogenated solvents such
as dichloroethane (DCE) and dichloromethane (DCM), and moderately
soluble in other polar solvents such as acetone, acetonitrile, and
ethanol. Among the various solvents utilized for photoarylation of
furan, better yields were obtained in the DMSO solvent (Table 2). Control experiments were
carried out in the absence of the photocatalyst or without irradiation.
The formation of the product in a very low yield (10%) in the absence
of the photocatalyst confirmed the importance of the photocatalyst
in mediating photoarylation (Table 2, entry 7). In the absence of light and both photocatalyst
and light, the product was obtained in traces (Table 2, entries 8 and 9).

green LED at 30 °C for 2 h.

d Without irradiation,
in the absence

To study
the substrate scope of this photoarylation, experiments
were carried out using different arenes and diazonium salts (Table 3). The reaction condition
utilized in the photoarylation of furan using 4-bromobenzenediazonium
tetrafluoroborate (Table 2, entry 5) was adopted in the arylation of furan using other
diazonium salts (Table 3, entries 1–6). Corresponding 2-arylfurans were obtained in
moderate to good yields. Further, we extended this methodology to
arylate thiophene. In the case of arylation of thiophene using 4-chlorobenzenediazonium
tetrafluoroborate, the arylated product was obtained in a low yield
(30%) upon 2 h irradiation (Table 2, entry 7). Extending the irradiation time to 4 h increased
the product yield (Table 3, entries 8 and 9). We further explored the photoarylation
of benzene as a representative example of simple arenes using different
diazonium salts (Table 3, entries 10–14). Photoarylation of benzene was sluggish,
and even after 12 h irradiation, different biphenyls were obtained
in lower yields (Table 3, entries 12–14). The photocatalyst system was found to be
effective in light-mediated arylation of heteroarenes. In photoarylation
using a radical scavenger TEMPO, the radical-scavenged product 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-(4-nitrophenoxy)piperidine
was obtained in 80% yield. This experiment affirmed that the photoarylation
proceeds via a radical intermediate (Scheme 4).

green LED at 30 °C for stipulated time.

Recoverability and recyclability are another attracting
features
of the immobilized catalyst system. We have studied the recyclability
of the newly developed pseudo-homogeneous immobilized photocatalyst
(Table 4). In a solvent
medium, the immobilized photocatalyst swells and behaves as a homogeneous-like
system. After the completion of the reaction, the photocatalyst was
recovered by simple filtration. The recovered catalyst was reused
in four recycles of photoarylation and found to be effective in catalyzing
photoarylation with out any deterioration in yield (Table 4).

under green LED at 30 °C for 2 h.

Further, we have explored the in situ diazotization
and photoarylation
in one pot for representative substituted anilines (Table 5). tert-Butyl
nitrite was used to diazotize p-substituted anilines.37 In our first exploration on in situ diazotization
and photoarylation, a mixture containing 4-chloroaniline, the resin-supported
photocatalyst, and furan in DMSO was irradiated using green LED at
30 °C for 2 h. It is interesting to note that the product 2-(4-chlorophenyl)furan
was obtained in 56% yield (Table 5, entry 1). When we treat 4-nitroaniline with furan
under the same reaction condition, 2-(4-nitrophenyl)furan was obtained
in 71% yield (Table 5, entry 2). In the photoarylation using diazonium salt, we are constrained
to use DMSO due to poor solubility of diazonium salt in other solvents.
In in situ diazotization and photoarylation, we have explored the
use of dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent. While we used DCM as a
solvent in the photoarylation of furan using 4-nitroaniline, we have
observed a slight decrease in yield, and the product was obtained
in 62% yield (Table 5, entry 3). Hence, we can avoid the use of DMSO as a solvent in photoarylation
by adopting in situ diazotization and photoarylation strategies. In
the absence of t-BuONO, the arylated product was
not formed (Table 5, entry 4).

Conclusions
We have developed a pseudo-homogeneously
immobilized BODIPY-based
photocatalyst from sustainable raw materials, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
and 2,4-dimethylpyrrole. The extent of loading was measured based
on optical intensity of the unreacted photocatalyst present in a reaction
medium. The immobilized photocatalyst was employed in C–H arylation
of heteroarenes and simple arenes. The catalyst was recovered from
a reaction medium by simple filtration. The recovered catalyst was
found to be effective in all four recycles tested. DMSO was used as
a solvent to facilitate the dissolution of diazonium salt. By adopting
in situ diazotization and photoarylation strategies, the use of DMSO
as a solvent can be avoided.

Experimental Section
General Information
1H NMR (300 MHz) spectra
were recorded using a Bruker 300 AVANCE II spectrometer, with chloroform-d as a solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a reference
(δ = 0 ppm). The chemical shifts are expressed in δ downfield
from the signal of internal TMS. Mass spectra were measured on a Shimadzu-Kratos-Axima
CFR+ MALDI-TOF spectrometer. Analytical thin layer chromatographic
tests were carried out on aluminium sheets coated with silica gel
GF provided by Merck. The spots were visualized using UV light. Column
chromatography was carried out using silica gel (230–400 mesh).
All yields reported are of isolated materials judged to be homogeneous
using TLC and NMR spectroscopy. Aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates,38 HMF,26,39 and 2,4-dimethylpyrrole40 were synthesized by a reported procedure. (Aminomethyl)polystyrene
(70–90 mesh, 1% cross-linked) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

8-(5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furanyl)-1,3,5,7-tetramethylBODIPY (HMF-BODIPY)
A solution of HMF (8.0 mmol, 1.0 g) in CH2Cl2 (5.0 mL) was added in drops to a mixture containing 2,4-dimethylpyrrole
(24 mmol, 2.4 mL), celite (50 mg), and CH2Cl2 (10 mL) and stirred for 1 h at 30 °C under N2. After
the complete consumption of HMF as evidenced by TLC analysis, the
reaction mixture was diluted with hexane (20 mL) and filtered. The
filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting reddish
brown solid was dissolved in toluene (100 mL) and then treated with
chloranil (8.8 mmol, 2.2 g, 1.1 equiv) at 30 °C for 45 min. To
the reaction mixture, Et3N (7.8 mL, 56 mmol, 7.0 equiv)
was added and stirred for 10 min. After 10 min, BF3·OEt2 (7.1 mL, 56 mmol, 7.0 equiv) was added in drops to the cooled
reaction mixture. The stirring was continued for 15 h, and the corresponding
BODIPY formation was confirmed by TLC analysis using a hexane/EtOAc
(1:1, v/v) mixture as an eluent. Then, the toluene layer from the
reaction mixture was decanted. The remaining viscous mass in the reaction
flask was washed with toluene (2 × 25 mL). The combined toluene
extract was washed with water, saturated with NaCl solution, dried
with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated
under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was purified by column
chromatography [silica, (30% EtOAc + 70% hexane)] to obtain the title
compound as a red color solid (138 mg, 5% yield). 1H NMR

The resulting reaction mixture was warmed to 30 °C and stirred

in dry CH2Cl2 (15 mL) and treated with Et3N (0.178 mL, 1.3 mmol, 4.0 equiv). The resulting reaction
mixture was stirred at 30 °C under N2 until the complete
consumption of 2,6-dibromo-8-(5-hydroxymethyl-2-furanyl)-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-BODIPY
as judged by TLC analysis (∼30 min). Then, the reaction mixture
was diluted with CH2Cl2 (10 mL) and washed with
warm water to remove excess succinic anhydride. The organic layer
was washed with saturated NaCl solution and dried with anhydrous sodium
sulfate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting
residue was dissolved in a minimum amount of CH2Cl2 and triturated with hexane. The resulting precipitate was
removed by filtration and dried under reduced pressure to obtain 2,6-dibromo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(5-succinyloxymethyl-2-furanyl)BODIPY
as a purple solid (120 mg, 63% yield). 1H NMR (300 MHz,

Epsilon Value
Calculation for HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc
For
the epsilon value calculation, a stock solution (200 μM) was
prepared by dissolving HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc (3.0 mg, 5.0 μmol)
in CH3CN (25 mL). Solutions of HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc of different
concentrations (6.6, 13, 20, 27, 33 μM) were prepared from stock
solution. For the prepared solutions, the absorbance at a λmax value of 545 nm was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy.
From the slope of the plot (concentration vs absorbance at 545 nm),
the ϵ value was determined to be 35,100 M–1 cm–1.

Loading of HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc on Resin
DIPEA (21 μL,
120 μmol, 2.0 equiv) was added to a stirred suspension of (aminomethyl)polystyrene
resin (40 mg, 60 μmol), HMF-BODIPY-Br-Suc (36 mg, 60 μmol),
and HBTU (34 mg, 90 μmol, 1.5 equiv) in dry CH2Cl2 (2.0 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 30 °C
under N2 for 12 h. The change in the color of resin from
translucent to dark red affirmed the loading of BODIPY on resin. The
extent of loading of BODIPY on resin was calculated by measuring the
absorbance of the reaction mixture. After 12 h, the resin loaded with
BODIPY was separated by filtration. On the basis of the absorbance
value of the filtrate at 545 nm, the amount of unreacted BODIPY was
found to be 8.5 μmol. Hence, the percentage of loading was found
to be 85.8%. The resin loaded with BODIPY was washed throughly and
dried under reduced pressure to obtain BODIPY immobilized on resin
(72 mg). On the basis of the increase in the weight of resin, the
percentage of loading was found to be 88%. This loading value was
utilized in calculating the amount of BODIPY present in 5 mg of immobilized
photocatalyst as 3.6 μmol.

General Procedure for Arylation
of Furan
Aryldiazonium
tetrafluoroborate (0.25 mmol) was added to a stirred suspension of
furan (1.0 mL) and HMF-BODIPY-loaded resin (5 mg, ∼3.6 μmol)
in DMSO (2.0 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred under irradiation
of green LED at 30 °C for 2 h. Then, the catalyst was separated
by filtration and washed with diethyl ether for further reuse. The
combined filtrate was diluted with diethyl ether, washed with water,
and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed under
reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified using column
chromatography to obtain arylated furan in pure form.
