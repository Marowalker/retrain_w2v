Introduction
Imidazoles are the
most valuable five-membered heterocyclic compounds
found in many natural products, biological systems, pharmaceuticals,
and agro chemicals.1,2 Additionally, imidazole derivatives
have been reported to possess pharmacological properties such as antiplasmodial,3 antitumor,4 and antifungal.5 Consequently, many efforts have been made in
the past decade on the synthesis of those privileged scaffolds. The
reported methods include reaction of amidines with halo (nitro)alkenes,6 haloketones,7 alkyne/haloakynes,8 and other methods.9 Although these methods are elegant and appear to be developed specifically
for obtaining multisubstituted imidazole derivatives, in organic synthesis,
the site-selective synthesis of the desired products is still an attractive
and challenging task. Our intention is to develop a method for selective
synthesis of 2,4-disubstituted imidazoles using easily available starting
reagents under mild reaction conditions. Hence, the synthesis of imidazoles
with free N–H and C-5 position for further (N1 and C-5) functionalization
of such scaffolds is of continued interest.

Results and Discussion
Despite these advances, to our knowledge, the oxidative cyclization
of vinyl azides with benzamidines has remained elusive in literatures.
In continuation of our studies on the synthesis of fused N-heterocycles,10 we report herein a facile method for the synthesis
of 2,4-disubstituted imidazoles with 1,8-diazabicyclo(5,4,0)undec-7-ene
(DBU) promoted by the oxidative cyclization of vinyl azides with benzamidines
under mild conditions (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 We began our study by taking benzimidamide hydrochloride
(1a) and (1-azidovinyl) benzene (2a) as
the model
substrates. The results are summarized in Table 1. Initially, the reaction of 1a and 2a was performed using 10 mol % of iodine as catalyst
in acetonitrile at room temperature for 8 h; the desired product (3a) formation was not observed (Table 1, entry 1). When the reaction was carried
out at 65 °C, with 20 mol % of catalyst, trace amount of 3a was observed (Table 1, entry 2). Under the same conditions, when K2CO3 was used as a base, 23% yields of the desired product 3a was isolated (Table 1, entry 3). A similar yield was observed without the iodine
source (Table 1, entry
4). In view of this reaction, we turned our attention to vary the reaction temperature (to 80 °C) and other
common solvents such as 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), dimethylformamide
(DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and toluene; consequently, the yield
varied between 45 and 67% (Table 1, entries 5–9). Further, we screened various
inorganic and organic bases (Na2CO3, Cs2CO3, tBuOK, Et3N, DBU, DBN, and DABCO) in acetonitrile as the solvent (Table 1, entries 10–16)
[DBN: 1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]non-5-ene; DABCO: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane].
Interestingly, with DBU as the base, 89% yield of the desired product
was obtained (entry 14). No further improvement in the yield was observed
while performing the reaction with other solvents such as DMSO, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and water with DBU as the
base (Table 1, entries
17–19). The reaction without DBU in acetonitrile as the solvent,
no product formation was observed (entry 20). After screening for
various parameters, the optimum conditions identified for the present
transformation are as follows: 1.5 equiv of 1a, 1.0 equiv
of 2a, and 1.5 equiv of DBU as the base in acetonitrile
at 80 °C (Table 1, entry 14).

a Reaction conditions,
unless otherwise
stated: 0.3 mmol of 1a, 0.2 mmol of 2a,
0.3 mmol of base, and 2 mL of solvent were placed in a reaction tube,
8 h, isolated yield.

Under
the optimized reaction conditions, the scope and generality
of the reaction were investigated and the results are summarized in Scheme 2. Initially, we performed
the reaction of benzimidamide hydrochloride (1a) with
various vinyl azides 2 and the reactions were found to
be very facile with both electron-rich and electron-deficient groups
(−Me, −OMe, −tBu, −Br,
and −F) at the para position of vinyl azides and the desired
products 3b–f were obtained in good
to excellent yields (80–94%). One of the product 3f was also confirmed by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis
(CCDC No. 1556865). The presence of −NO2, −Me,
or −OMe group at either the ortho or meta position of vinyl
azides produced the corresponding products 3g–j in moderate to good yields (67–79%).

Scheme 2 Substrate
Scope of Various Vinyl Azides with Benzamidine (1a)
Reaction conditions: 0.3 mmol
of 1a, 0.2 mmol of 2, 0.3 mmol DBU, 2.0
mL CH3CN were placed in a reaction tube at 80° C,
8 h, isolated yields.

To expand the scope
of the present transformation, we explored
the reactivity of the substituted benzamidines substrate with various
vinyl azides, and the results are compiled in Scheme 3. The electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
(−Me, −Br, −Cl, and −NO2) substituents
at the para position of benzamidine reacted smoothly with (1-azidovinyl)
benzene and produced the corresponding products 5a–d in good yields (66–87%). Interestingly, the presence
of strong electron-donating benzamidines such as 4-aminobenzimidamide
hydrochloride and 4-hydroxybenzimidamide hydrochloride reacted with 2a and gave the products 5e and 5f in 70 and 33% yields, respectively. Interestingly, the procedure
is amenable to nicotinimidamide hydrochloride and cyclopropane carboximidamide
and affords the differently decorated products 5g and 5h in 60 and 72% yield, respectively. Additionally, we evaluated
the substrate scope of various benzamidines as
well as vinyl azides (having both electron-rich and electron-deficient
groups in both the rings at either position ortho/meta/para), which
afforded the desired products 5i–r in good yields (63–92%). The presence of electron-releasing
groups (5n), electron-withdrawing groups (5o and 5p), or halogens (5l and 5o) on both the rings provided good yields of products. The results
from Schemes 2 and 3 demonstrate the versatility
of the reactions with a high degree of functional group tolerance
and with a broad substrate scope. It may be noted that halide-substituted
derivatives were well tolerated and could be further applied in traditional
cross-coupling reactions. Unfortunately, the present transformation
is not suitable for aliphatic benzimidamides with vinyl azide.

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope of Various Benzamidines and Vinyl Azides
Reaction conditions: 0.3 mmol
of 4, 0.2 mmol of 2, 0.3 mmol of base, and
2 mL of solvent were placed in a reaction tube, isolated yields, DBU
as a base and CH3CN as a solvent, 8 h.

Dry acetonitrile was used.

To validate the process for scale-up studies (gram scale), we performed
the reaction of 1a with 1-(1-azidovinyl)-4-bromobenzene
under optimized conditions and obtained the corresponding product 3f in 72% yield (2.15 g) (Scheme 4). This study indicates the feasibility of
the method for industrial/commercial production.

Scheme 4 Gram Scale Preparation
To gain further insight into
the reaction mechanism, some control
experiments were performed (Scheme 5). The reaction of N-phenylbenzimidamide 6a was subjected with 2a under standard conditions,
expect product 7a was not observed (Scheme 5, eq 1). This reaction suggests
that the free NH2 group (of amidine) is essential for such
a transformation.8b Further, the reaction
of 1a with (1-bromovinyl) benzene (8) was
conducted under optimized conditions; no reaction was observed, but
91% of 8 was recovered (Scheme 5, eq 2). It indicates that the direct removal
of azide was not possible; the reaction may proceed via nitrene intermediate
from vinyl azide (Scheme 5, eq 3). To ascertain whether the reaction proceeds by radical
pathway or not, the reaction of 1a and 2a was checked with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical under
optimized conditions, 86% of 3a was isolated. This rule
outs the radical reaction route. Finally, benzimidamide 9 subjected with 2a in CH3CN without DBU,
91% of the desired product 3a was obtained (Scheme 5, eq 4). This reaction
and eq 1 (Scheme 5)
together clarify the necessity of NH2 (amidine) in the
present transformation. Hence, the role of DBU is to neutralize the
hydrochloride of 1a (benzimidamide hydrochloride).

Scheme 5 Control Experiments
On the basis of the control experiments and literature
reports,11 a plausible reaction mechanism
has been proposed
(Scheme 6). Initially,
benzimidamide hydrochloride (1a) neutralization
by base (DBU) gives benzimidamide 9. The nucleophilic
addition of 9 with (1-azidovinyl) benzene (2a) gives the intermediate I by the loss of N2. The intermediate I undergoes cyclization (intermediate II) and the subsequent elimination of ammonia afford the desired
product 3a.

Scheme 6 Plausible Mechanism
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new
simple method for the
synthesis of 2,4-disubstituted imidazole derivatives through [3 +
2] cyclization of benzamidines with vinyl azides. This methodology
is applicable for the selective synthesis of 2,4-disubstituted imidazoles
in good to excellent yields, with a high degree of functional group
tolerance.

dd (doublet of doublets), and so on. Coupling constant (J) was given in Hz. Chemical shifts are reported in δ relative to tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard. The peaks around δ values of 7.26 (1H NMR) and 77.0 (13C NMR) correspond to CDCl3. The peaks around δ values of 2.50 (1H NMR)
and 39.9 (13C NMR) correspond to DMSO. The peak around
δ values of 3.35 (1H NMR) correspond to H2O present in DMSO solvent. The peaks around δ values of 4.78
and 3.20 (1H NMR) and 47.5 (13C NMR) correspond
to CD3OD. Progress of the reactions was monitored by thin-layer
chromatography (TLC). Silica gel 100–200 mesh size was used
for column chromatography using a hexane/ethyl acetate eluent unless
otherwise indicated.

General Procedure for 3a
Benzimidamide
hydrochloride 1a (47 mg, 0.3 mmol), (1-azidovinyl) benzene 2a (29 mg, 0.2 mmol), and DBU (45.6 mg, 0.3 mmol) were taken
in a 10 mL reaction tube; to the mixture, 2.0 mL of acetonitrile was
added. The reaction tube was placed in a preheated oil bath at 80
°C for 8 h (progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC). Then,
the reaction mixture was allowed to attain room temperature;
10.0 mL of brine solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 ×
15 mL) and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. After
the removal of solvent, the crude mixture was subjected to column
chromatography on silica gel and 89% yield of the product 2,4-disubstituted
imidazole (39.2 mg) 3a was isolated. (All of the vinyl
azides employed in the present work were prepared by known procedure.12)
