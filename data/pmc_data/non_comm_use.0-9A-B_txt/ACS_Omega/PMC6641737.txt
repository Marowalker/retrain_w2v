In this study, bifurfural, an inedible
biobased chemical and a
second-generation biomass, was polymerized with several diamines using
an environmentally benign process, and the chemical structures of
the resulting poly(Schiff base)s were analyzed. Because furan rings,
which are only produced from biomass and not from fossil resources,
endow polymers with unique properties that include high rigidity and
expanded π-conjugation, bifurfural, which contains two furan
rings, is of significant interest as a biobased building block. 1H NMR, IR, and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time
of flight mass spectra of the poly(Schiff base)s reveal that they
are composed of mixtures of linear and cyclic structures. The UV–vis
spectroscopy and molecular orbital theory confirm the extended π-conjugation
in the bifurfural/p-phenylenediamine poly(Schiff
base) system. Poly(Schiff base)s composed of bifurfural and 1,3-propanediamine,
1,4-butandiamine, 1,5-pentanediamine, and 1,6-hexanediamine were molded
at 120 °C into films that exhibited good strengths and were tough
to bend. These results indicate that bifurfural-based poly(Schiff
base)s are promising biobased materials.

Introduction
Biomass is a critical
alternative to fossil resources that combat
carbon dioxide emissions and address the issue of dwindling fossil-fuel
reserves. Although synthetic polymers are mainly produced from fossil
resources, some commercially available polymers have shifted their
resources to biomass.1−3 Biobased polyethylene (PE)4 and poly(lactic acid)5 are manufactured
from edible biomass, such as sugar and starch, which are defined as
being “first-generation” biomass resources. On the other
hand, inedible biomass, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin,
are gaining attention as sources of “second-generation”
biomass.6,7 To prevent competition between food and
material (or energy) uses of crops, second-generation biomass provides
an alternative to fossil resources and first-generation biomass.6,7

Furfural, which is manufactured from inedible biomass, has
been
gaining attention as a second-generation biomass resource.8−12 We have produced a range of biobased chemicals for polymer synthesis,
including 1,4-butanediol,13,14 succinic acid,13 oxabicyclic anhydride,15,16 and terephthalic acid,17 from furfural
alone. Because the first step in their syntheses involves the oxidation
of furfural to afford a mixture of fumaric acid and maleic acid, these
products are devoid of furan rings. On the other hand, chemicals containing
furan rings, such as furfural, furfuryl alcohol, 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural,
2,5-dimethyl furan, and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), are produced
industrially only from biomass and never from fossil resources due
to the high costs involved.18 In the past
decade, poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF), which is composed of ethylene
glycol and FDCA, has been produced commercially as an alternative
to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET).19 Because PEF exhibits several superior properties that are associated
with the furan ring, such as gas permeability, the biobased PEF may
replace PET in the future. PEF highlights the potential of the furan
ring in next-generation biobased polymers.

To enhance the characteristic
properties of the furan ring, we
have focused on the bifuryl group, which consists of two furan rings
connected through their 2-positions. The biphenyl group, which is
an analogue of the bifuryl group, consists of C–C bonded benzene
rings and possesses several characteristic properties, including extended
π-conjugation, liquid crystallinity, and rigidity. The biphenyl
group has been used in many functional applications, such as electrical
devices,20 liquid crystals,21 and high-performance polymers.22 Park et al. synthesized polyamides containing bifuryl groups
as organic electroluminescent materials;23 however, they did not consider the bifuryl group to be a biobased
moiety even though it is potentially produced from biobased furfural.
The first synthesis of bifurfural was reported by Grigg et al. in
1966 and involved the Ullman coupling of furfural derivatives through
their 5-positions.100 In 1976, Kozhevnikov
et al. reported the direct oxidative homocoupling of furfural to give
bifurfural.24 Methods for the synthesis
of compounds containing bifuryl groups have improved infrequently.
In 2014, Li et al. reported a practical method for the production
of some bifuryl-containing compounds,25 whereas in 2017, Miyagawa et al. synthesized polyesters of bifurandicarboxylic
acid, which is composed of one bifuryl and two carboxylic acid groups.26

Bifurfural, which is composed of one bifuryl
and two formyl groups,
is the basic structure of biobased bifuran derivatives because other
bifuryl compounds can be prepared from it. For example, bifurancarboxylic
acid can be synthesized through the oxidation of bifurfural. On the
other hand, the dialdehyde is setup to form poly(Schiff base)s with
diamines. As several diamines are synthesized from biomass, poly(Schiff
base)s composed of bifurfural are potentially fully biobased polymers.
The polymerization process that forms the poly(Schiff base) is environmentally
benign because it does not rely on a catalyst. As the imine bonds
in poly(Schiff base)s are readily hydrolyzed by acid, they revert
to their monomeric forms. In addition, these bonds can be reformed
by the removal of water. As a consequence, Fukuda et al. demonstrated
that such poly(Schiff base)s are environmentally degradable polymers.27 In 1992, Hui et al. demonstrated that a poly(Schiff
base) composed of furan and p-phenylenediamine units
exhibited good thermal stability, and that the π-conjugation
extended over the two furan rings and the phenylene group.28

In this study, we polymerized bifurfural
with several diamines,
in the presence of m-cresol or in the absence of
solvent, to yield poly(Schiff base)s; their chemical structures were
determined by 1H NMR and IR spectroscopies, size exclusion
chromatography (SEC), and matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Thermal and optical properties were
examined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), and UV–vis spectroscopy; the UV–vis
spectra were also simulated by computational methods. In addition,
physical properties were examined by tensile strength testing using
melt-molded films.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Properties
of Bifurfural
Scheme 1 shows the pathway used to
synthesize the poly(Schiff base)s from furfural. Bifurfural was prepared
from furfural by oxidative homocoupling following a literature procedure.25 To prevent side reactions and increase the electron
density of the furan ring, the aldehyde was converted into the corresponding
1,3-dioxolane through protection as an acetal. Figure S2 shows the 1H NMR spectrum of 2-(2-furyl)-1,3-dioxolane.
The oxidative homocoupling reaction of 2-(2-furyl)-1,3-dioxolane was
carried out with palladium acetate as the catalyst under an atmosphere
of oxygen, after which the acetal group was removed by treatment with
hydrochloric acid, to give bifurfural. The direct homocoupling product
from 2-(2-furyl)-1,3-dioxolane was not isolated because it became
partially deprotected under the oxidative homocoupling reaction conditions
to afford the monoprotected and unprotected bifurfurals. Sublimation
of the resulting mixture at 130 °C at a pressure below 1 Pa gave
purified bifurfural in an overall yield of 39%. Bifurfural is slightly
soluble in chloroform, dichloromethane, and tetrahydrofuran, but insoluble
in water, methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate, and diethyl ether. In
general, π-conjugated compounds are poorly soluble due to strong
π–π interactions. Bloom et al. used ab initio calculations
to investigate the geometry and energy of dimeric 2,2′-bifuran.
They observed that the most stable conformation of bifuran occurs
when the torsional angle between the two furan groups is 180°;
the two furan rings are coplanar in this conformation, and the overall
group is remarkably π-conjugated. On the other hand, the two
phenyl rings of the biphenyl group prefer to be twisted.29 To evaluate the geometry and the extended π-conjugation
of bifurfural, the molecular orbitals of bifurfural were calculated
using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level. Figure 1 reveals that the
most stable geometry of bifurfural is of C2h symmetry, with an antiparallel arrangement of the
furan rings; other geometries and their associated energies are shown
in Figure S1. The highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
are clearly extended over the two furan rings and both formyl groups
(Figure 1), confirming
that π-conjugation extends throughout bifurfural; strong intermolecular
π–π interactions between the furan rings and formyl
groups results in its low solubility.

orbital (HOMO) and (b) the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).

Scheme 1 Polymerizing Bifurfural
Bifurfural was polymerized
with five aliphatic diamines, namely, 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine,
1,4-butanediamine, 1,5-pentanediamine, and 1,6-hexanediamine, as well
as one aromatic diamine, p-phenylenediamine, to give
poly(Schiff base)s; these polymers are referred to as “PSE”,
“PSPr”, “PSB”, “PSPe”, “PSH”,
and “PSPh”, respectively. The reaction conditions used
to prepare these materials are summarized in Table 1. In the absence of solvent, the polymerization
reaction was carried out at 140 °C for 6 h. Because m-cresol has often been used as the solvent in polymerizations to
form poly(Schiff base)s, we carried out the polymerization at 30 °C
for 1 h in m-cresol. The formation of the imine bond
proceeded in the absence of a catalyst, and the color of the reaction
mixture gradually changed from yellow to orange and then became yellowish-brown
or reddish-brown. Poly(Schiff base)s could be prepared either without
solvent or in m-cresol when aliphatic diamines were
used, whereas PSPh could not be prepared in the absence of solvent.
The in vacuo removal of m-cresol, as the solvent,
from the poly(Schiff base)s prepared using the aliphatic diamines
was difficult; these polymers were purified by double reprecipitation
and extraction with methanol and ethanol. Méalares et al. also
reported that it was difficult to remove m-cresol
from poly(Schiff base)s prepared from 2,5-furandicarboxaldehyde30 because m-cresol has a strong
affinity for furan rings. Unfortunately, we were unable to remove m-cresol from PSPr and PSPe; consequently, their yields
were determined from their 1H NMR spectra. Polymerizations
with 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine, 1,4-butanediamine, 1,5-pentanediamine,
and 1,6-hexanediamine, without solvent, gave PSE, PSPr, PSB, PSPe,
and PSH in yields of 76, 71, 70, 54, and 60%, respectively. In addition,
the analogous polymerizations in m-cresol provided
PSE in 28%, PSPr in 32%, PSB in 12%, PSPe in 5%, PSH in 60%, and PSPh
in 67% yield. Except for PSH and PSPh, the yields of poly(Schiff base)s
in m-cresol were lower than those in the absence
of solvent. In the case of PSH, the yields in the absence and presence
of solvent were the same, but more high-molecular-weight fraction
was produced when PSH was polymerized in the absence of m-cresol than in the presence of m-cresol, as shown
in Figure S3. These results indicate that m-cresol is unsuitable as a solvent for polymerizing aliphatic
diamines to poly(Schiff base)s. During the polymerization of PSPh,
the precipitate obtained in the absence of solvent was mainly bifurfural,
whereas that in m-cresol was PSPh, indicating that m-cresol is suitable as a solvent for the polymerization
of PSPh. The color of the poly(Schiff base) depended on the diamine,
as listed in Table 1. The bifuryl-containing poly(Schiff base)s were soluble in some
organic solvents, whereas previously reported poly(Schiff base)s were
hard to dissolve in organic solvents and often became insoluble following
reprecipitation.31 Polymer solubility is
important for electric-device applications because wet processes are
used to fabricate these devices. The poly(Schiff base)s were slightly
soluble in halomethane solvents, namely chloroform and dichloromethane,
and amide-based aprotic polar solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, and N-methylpyrrolidone,
but they were insoluble in other polar solvents, including water,
methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran.
PSH was completely soluble in chloroform and dichloromethane under
reflux.

Structural
Analyses of the Poly(Schiff Base)s
Although
the yields of the poly(Schiff base)s prepared from the aliphatic diamines
were higher in m-cresol than in the absence of solvent,
it was difficult to remove the residual m-cresol
from the resulting precipitate; PSPh from p-phenylenediamine
was not obtained in the absence of solvent. To analyze the chemical
structures of the poly(Schiff base)s, we examined PSE, PSPr, PSB,
PSPe, and PSH samples that were polymerized without solvent, whereas
PSPh polymerized in m-cresol was used.

Figure 2 displays the partial 1H NMR spectra of bifurfural and the poly(Schiff base)s; full
spectra are shown in Figure S4. Peaks corresponding
to iminyl protons (Hd) at around 8 ppm were observed, whereas
the peak corresponding to the formyl proton (Ha) at around
9.7 ppm became comparatively weaker following polymerization. Although
peaks at around 9.7 ppm were visible in the spectra of PSPr, PSPe,
PSH, and PSPh, they appeared at higher magnetic fields compared with
that of bifurfural, indicating that they are derived from terminal
formyl groups (Ha′). The separated peaks at around
9.7 and 8.3 ppm, which correspond to Ha′ and Hd in PSPh, are the result of syn- and anti-conformations about
the imine/carbonyl and imine/imine bonds, respectively, because the p-phenylene unit inhibits the free rotation of the imine
bond. The peaks corresponding to the amine-derived terminal group
were not observed in the spectra of PSE, PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSPh,
indicating that these polymers are terminated at each end with bifuryl
groups. On the other hand, peaks corresponding to formyl and amino
terminal groups are observed in the spectrum of PSH. The number average
molecular weights of PSPr, PSPe, PSH, and PSPh were calculated from
their 1H NMR spectra; the integrated Ha-to-Hd signal ratios led to values of 1.2 × 104,
0.30 × 104, 7.9 × 104, and 0.74 ×
104, respectively. The peaks corresponding to Ha′ in PSE and PSB were not observed, suggesting that their
molecular weights are very high.

MHz, CDCl3) of
bifurfural and the poly(Schiff base)s. The 13C satellite
peaks of chloroform are indicated by asterisks.

Figure 3 displays
the IR spectra of bifurfural and the poly(Schiff base)s. Peaks corresponding
to the C=N double bonds are visible at 1635 cm–1, whereas peaks due to C=O double bonds, at around 1660 cm–1, were observed to be weaker following polymerization.
The residual C=O peaks in the spectra of PSPr, PSPe, PSH, and
PSPh were observed at 1670 cm–1, indicating that
the proportions of terminal formyl groups in PSPr, PSPe, PSH, and
PSPh were relatively high; the high proportions of terminal groups
indicate that the molecular weights of these polymers were not high.
On the other hand, C=O peaks were not observed in the spectra
of PSE and PSB, suggesting that the proportions the terminal formyl
groups in PSE and PSB were low, and that the molecular weights of
PSE and PSB were higher than those of the other polymers. These results
are consistent with those obtained by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Figure 3 IR spectra
of bifurfural and the poly(Schiff base)s.

The molecular weights of the poly(Schiff base)s were evaluated
by SEC, the profiles of which are shown in Figure 4; the x-axis in this figure
displays the logarithm of the molecular weight determined against
a polystyrene standard. The SEC traces conflict with the 1H NMR and IR data. As discussed above, the number average molecular
weights calculated by 1H NMR spectroscopy exceeded 3.0
× 103, especially those of PSE and PSB, which are
expected to be high-molecular-weight polymers. However, the molecular
weights of the main fractions of all poly(Schiff base)s were between
100 and 1000, whereas a slightly higher-molecular-weight fraction
was observed in the SEC profiles of PSPe, PSH, and PSPh.

Figure 4 SEC traces
of the poly(Schiff base)s.

To gain an insight into the origins of this conflict, the
poly(Schiff
base)s were subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS. Figure 5 displays the MALDI-TOF-MS spectra of PSH
and PSPh as representative spectra of the poly(Schiff base)s, whereas Figure S5 displays the spectra of the remaining
polymers. As depicted in Figure 5a, the small repeating peaks observed for PSH are assigned
to silver-ion-coordinated linear structures terminated with bifurfural
at both ends, whereas the large repeating peaks were assigned to silver-ion-coordinated
cyclic structures. Figure S5 reveals that
similar repeating peaks were also observed in the spectra of PSE,
PSPr, PSB, and PSPe, indicating that both linear and cyclic structures
were formed during Schiff-base polymerizations with aliphatic diamines,
with the cyclic structures preferred over the linear structures. In
the case of PSPh, the repeating peaks corresponding to cyclic structures
were less intense than those corresponding to linear structures (Figure 5b). These results
indicate that the formation of smaller cyclic structures was sterically
restricted, whereas the formation of larger cyclic structures was
entropically restricted as a result of the rigid p-phenylenediamine structure, whereas aliphatic diamines, especially
1,6-hexanediamine, facilitated the easy formation of both cyclic and
linear poly(Schiff base)s due to their flexibilities.

ion spectra of (a) PSH and (b) PSPh. Color
code: Black corresponds to cyclic structures, red corresponds to linear
structures terminated at both end with bifurfural groups, blue corresponds
to linear structures terminated at both ends with amines, and green
corresponds to linear structures terminated with both amines and bifurfural
moieties.

The reaction of an amine with
an aldehyde to form an imine is an
equilibrium process under acidic conditions. Because the condition
in chloroform is weakly acidic condition due to its decomposition
to form hydrochloric acid, a poly(Schiff base) in chloroform would
decompose into the diamine and bifurfural, and then followed by reconstruction
to form the thermally stable cyclic structure. To investigate the
decomposition of the poly(Schiff base)s, PSH was subjected to time-dependent
SEC analysis following the dissolution in chloroform (1.0 mg mL–1), the results of which are displayed in Figure 6. The high-molecular-weight
fraction containing linear structures was observed to decrease, whereas
the low-molecular-weight fraction containing cyclic structures was
observed to concomitantly increase over a 2 h period. This result
indicates that a poly(Schiff base) in chloroform exists in equilibrium,
with the linear structures formed in the absence of solvent decomposing
and reforming as the thermally more stable cyclic structures in dilute
chloroform solution.

without solvent.

Thermal Properties
TGA and DSC traces of various poly(Schiff
base)s are shown in Figure 7. The weight loss temperatures, residual weights at 1000 °C,
and glass transition temperatures (Tgs)
of the poly(Schiff base)s are summarized in Table 2. The 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td5%s) of PSE, PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSH were
in the 260–280 °C range, whereas that of PSPh was 339
°C. The residual weights of the poly(Schiff base)s were above
40% following heating to 1000 °C, and the samples following testing
were shiny and black, indicating that the poly(Schiff base)s are readily
carbonized. As listed in Table S1, elemental
analyses of the black residues reveal that about half of the original
nitrogen atoms remain in the carbonized residues, which suggests that
carbon nitride-like residues had formed. A carbon electrode is prepared
from furan resin because furan rings readily form graphite;32 in general, half of the nitrogen atoms in the
furan resin remain in the carbonized residue following this process.33 Therefore, the high residual weights of these
poly(Schiff base)s reflect the properties of the furan ring. The Tgs of PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSH decreased with
increasing length of the alkyl chain in the starting aliphatic diamine,
whereas PSE and PSPh did not exhibit Tgs during the DSC measurements in the second heating and first cooling
processes. Endothermic and exothermic peaks derived from melting and
crystallization were not observed in any poly(Schiff base). On the
other hand, weak crystalline peaks were observed in the wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns of melt-molded samples of PSE, PSB,
and PSPh films, whereas only a halo peak was observed in those of
the PSPr, PSPe, and PSH films, as shown in Figure S6. These results indicate that PSE, PSB, and PSPh are crystalline
polymers. Moreover, PSPr, PSPe, and PSH are also crystalline polymers
that exhibit low crystallization speeds because all of the poly(Schiff
base)s in this study contain bifuryl groups with extended π–π
conjugation that would be ready to form crystalline phases.

Optical
Properties
Figure 8 displays the UV–vis spectra of the
poly(Schiff base)s acquired in dichloromethane. Bifurfural and PSH
completely dissolved in dichloromethane at concentrations of 5 μg
mL–1, whereas an insoluble component remained for
PSE, PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSPh; consequently, quantitative evaluations
are difficult and the spectra were normalized (Figure 8). The wavelength maxima (λmax) of the various polymers are summarized in Table 2. PSE, PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSH exhibited
identical λmax values, whereas PSPh exhibited a broad
band with a λmax of 442 nm, indicative of π-conjugation
involving the imine bonds and bifuryl groups in PSPh, as well as the
phenylene groups. The λmax of bifurfural, the bis(ethylimine)
derivative constructed from bifurfural and ethylamine as a model of
PSE, PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSH, and the bis(phenylimine) derivative
constructed from bifurfural and aniline as a model of PSP were subjected
to time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations (Figure S7). The λmax of bifurfural, bis(ethylimine),
and bis(phenylimine) were calculated to be 349, 366, and 433 nm, respectively,
and consistent with the experimentally observed values. The λmax derived from the π–π* transitions did
not depend on the length of the aliphatic diamine because the chromophores
in these poly(Schiff base)s correspond to imine–bifuryl–imine
bonds that are not affected by chain length. In addition, their solid-state
colors (Table 1) do
not coincide with the UV–vis spectra because they appear yellow
in solution. This suggests that the color in the solid state is the
result of charge-transfer complexes formed between the bifuryl group
and imine double bond.

base)s

Mechanical Properties
The mechanical properties of
the polymers were assessed using melt-molded films. PSPr, PSB, PSPe,
and PSH could be molded at 120 °C into self-standing films; however,
PSE and PSPh formed powders after molding at 150 °C. Figure 9 displays the stress–strain
curves of PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSH. The Young’s moduli, tensile
strengths, and strains at breaking point are summarized in Table 2. All the films were
reddish-brown, those of PSPr, PSPe, and PSH were transparent, whereas
unmelted particles remained in the PSB film. As shown in Figure 9b, the PSPr film
was tough to bend; the Young’s moduli of all the films were
around 1 GPa, with strains at the breaking point below 10%, indicating
that PSPr, PSPe, and PSH are tough polymers. The cyclic structures
act as plasticizers that affect the mechanical properties differently.
On the other hand, PSB was relatively fragile due to residual particles
in the specimen, and its tensile strength and strain at breaking point
were lower than those of others.

Conclusions
Furfural is a promising biobased chemical
for the production of
polymers. We successfully synthesized biobased poly(Schiff base)s
by the reactions of a variety of diamines with bifurfural obtained
from furfural, using an environmentally benign process devoid of both
solvent and catalyst. 1H NMR, IR, and MALDI-TOF-MS spectra
indicate that the poly(Schiff base)s are mixtures of linear and cyclic
structures. The poly(Schiff base)s in chloroform are in equilibria
and form thermally stable cyclic structures. The DSC traces reveal
that the Tgs of poly(Schiff base)s composed
of aliphatic diamines depended on the length of the alkyl chain. The
UV–vis spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal the expanded
π-conjugation in PSPh. PSPr, PSB, PSPe, and PSH were moldable
at 120 °C, and the molded films were tough to bend and strong.
Therefore, we demonstrated that a poly(Schiff base) composed of bifurfural
is a novel biobased polymer with good mechanical properties and extended
π-conjugation. We are currently evaluating the environmental
benignness and photoelectric properties of these materials for use
in green electrical devices.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Furfural,
toluene, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetic
acid, anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, hydrochloric acid, ethylene diamine,
dichloromethane, m-cresol, and deuterated chloroform
were purchased from Kanto Kagaku Co., Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). p-Toluenesulfonic acid, 1,3-propanediamine, 1,4-butanediamine,
1,5-pentanediamine, and 1,6-hexanediamine were purchased from Tokyo
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Palladium diacetate and
ethylene glycol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan Co., LLC.
(Tokyo, Japan). Furfural was used after distillation from Na2CO3 under reduced pressure. Acetic acid was distilled,
and m-cresol was distilled under reduced pressure.
Toluene, dichloromethane, dimethyl sulfoxide, and ethylene glycol
were distilled from calcium hydride before use. Ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine,
1,4-butanediamine, and 1,5-pentanediamine were distilled over 4 Å
molecular sieves. 1,6-Hexanediamine and p-phenylenediamine
were sublimed under reduced pressure. All the other chemicals were
of reagent grade and used without further purification.

Synthesis of
2-(2-Furyl)-1,3-dioxolane34,35
p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (53
mg, 0.28 mmol) was added to a solution of furfural (11.4 mL, 138 mmol)
and ethylene glycol (8.9 mL, 158 mmol) in toluene (35 mL). The reaction
mixture was refluxed with Dean–Stark apparatus under N2 for 12 h, and the resulting solid was removed by filtration.
The solution was concentrated in vacuo and washed with saturated NaHCO3 (20 mL) and saturated brine (20 mL), followed by extraction
with dichloromethane (20 × 2 mL). The combined organic layers
were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. Then, the solvent
removed in vacuo. The crude liquid was distilled at 60 °C/50
Pa to give 2-furyl-1,3-dioxolane (12.5 g, 65%) as a colorless liquid.

Synthesis of Bifurfural25,36
Palladium
acetate (372 mg, 1.66 mmol), dimethyl sulfoxide (32 mL), acetic acid
(8 mL), and 2-(2-furyl)-1,3-dioxolane (2 mL, 16.6 mmol) were added
to a 100 mL two-necked flask. The flask was flushed with O2, after which the reaction mixture was heated at 50 °C for 24
h under O2 (3 L rubber balloon). The resulting mixture
was washed with saturated NaHCO3 (50 mL) and saturated
brine (30 mL), followed by extraction with dichloromethane (20 ×
5 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate and filtered. Then, the solvent was removed in vacuo at room
temperature to give a mixture of a solid and viscous liquid. The crude
product was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL), and 1 M aqueous
HCl (12.5 mL) was added dropwise to the solution. After stirring at
room temperature for 5 min, the resulting precipitate was collected
by filtration and dried under vacuum at room temperature to give the
crude product as a brown solid. The crude product was purified by
sublimation at 130 °C/1 Pa to afford bifurfural (0.47 g, 60%)
as a yellow solid.

General Procedure for the Preparation of
Poly(Schiff Base)s
in the Absence of Solvent28
A
mixture of bifurfural (0.526 mmol) and the diamine (0.526 mmol) was
stirred at 140 °C for 3 h in a 25 mL two-necked flask under N2. After the reaction mixture was heated under vacuum at 140
°C for 3 h, the resulting solid was washed with methanol and
heated under vacuum at 80 °C to remove the residual methanol.
The resulting solid was collected as a yellowish-brown solid or a
reddish-brown material.

General Procedure for the Preparation of
Poly(Schiff Base)s
in m-Cresol31
m-Cresol (0.5 mL) was added to a mixture of bifurfural
(0.526 mmol) and the diamine (0.526 mmol) in a 25 mL two-necked flask
under N2. After stirring at 30 °C for 1 h, the resulting
solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (2 mL), and the solution was
poured into methanol (40 mL). The resulting precipitate was collected
by filtration and heated at 80 °C under vacuum to remove the
residual m-cresol and methanol to give a red solid.

Spectroscopy
1H NMR spectra were recorded
at 400 MHz on a JNM-ECX400 NMR spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) in
deuterated chloroform and with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard.
IR spectra were acquired using a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Yokohama, Japan) equipped with a single-reflection
attenuated total reflectance system (Spectra-Tech Foundation Performer;
Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Yokohama, Japan). The UV–vis
spectra were recorded using a U-300 UV–vis spectrometer (Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan). A dichloromethane solution of the sample (5 μg
mL–1) was prepared and examined at room temperature
using a quartz cell (10 × 10 × 20 mm3). The soluble
proportions of low-solubility samples were examined after adding 25
μg of the sample to 5 mL of dichloromethane.

Molecular Weights
Molecular weights were determined
by SEC with a refractive index detector using a combination of two
TSKgel MultiporeHXL-M columns (Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) and a guard
column (TSKgel guard column MP (XL); Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan). The
columns were eluted with chloroform (1.0 mL min–1 at 40 °C) and polystyrene standards were used for calibration.
Mass spectra were recorded on an AXIMA Performance MALDI-TOF-MS (Shimadzu
Co., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm).
The spectrometer was operated in linear and reflectron-positive ion
modes with pulsed ion extraction. Polymer samples in dichloromethane
(100 mg mL–1) and tetrahydrofuran solutions of sodium
trifluoroacetate (100 mg mL–1) or silver trifluoroacetate
(100 mg mL–1) were mixed (in equal volumes), and
2 μL aliquot of each mixture was deposited onto the sample target
plate.

Thermal Properties
Thermal stabilities were determined
using an STA-6000 thermal gravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer Co., Ltd.,
Yokohama, Japan) to 1000 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 under N2. Glass transition temperatures (Tgs) were determined by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC-4000; PerkinElmer Inc., Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan). After each
sample was heated to 200 °C and cooled to −60 °C
at a rate of 10 °C min–1, it was then heated
from −60 to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 during the second heating scan. The Tg of each polymer was determined from the second heating scan.

Tensile
Strength Testing
Each sample was compressed
into a 10 × 20 × 0.1 mm3 film at 15 MPa using
a Mini Press Test 10 hot-pressing machine (Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 120 °C for 5 min. After compressing, the
melt-pressed film was annealed at room temperature. The film was cut
into 20 × 2.0 × 0.10 mm3 specimens, and the strength
and strain of each specimen at breaking point were measured using
an EZ-test universal material testing machine (Shimadzu) at 23 °C.
The grip distance was 10 mm, and the tensile strength test speed rate
was 10 mm min–1. The tensile strength was determined
as the maximum strength required to break the material on the stress–strain
curve. The tensile strain at the breaking point was determined as
the maximum strain on the stress–strain curve.

X-ray Diffraction
Analysis
WAXD measurements were conducted
using X-ray diffractometer (RINT220; Rigaku Co., Tokyo, Japan). The
radiation source was Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.154
nm. The voltage was set to be 40 kV and the current 20 mA. Each melt-pressed
film was mounted on a sample holder and scanned from 5 to 60°.

DFT Calculations37
DFT and
TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the Gaussian-09 Revision
C.01 WIN64 program package.38 The geometries
of bifurfural and the model imines were optimized by DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
and excited states were calculated by TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p).
The orbital interactions were evaluated using the natural bond orbital
method, and the structures and orbitals were visualized using the
GaussView ver. 5.0.9 program.

Decomposition Testing of
PSH in Chloroform
PSH (50
mg) was dissolved in chloroform (50 mL) under N2. The solution
was stirred at room temperature, and the molecular weight profile
of an aliquot of the solution was recorded by SEC after 0, 2, 4, 6,
24, and 72 h.
