A pentapeptide nanoreactor has been
designed and synthesized as
a platform to carry out the traditional organic reactions such as
bromination, iodination, cycloaddition, and condensation reactions.
The pentapeptide Boc–Phe–Phe–Aib–Phe–Phe–OMe
with a supramolecular helical structure and π-rich channel provides
nanoconfinements and thus facilitates the organic reactions. Bromination
and iodination of aniline take place without any halogen carrier (Lewis
acid) in the pentapeptide platform. Iodination produced p-iodoaniline only. The Diels–Alder reaction between furan
and maleic anhydride increased 2-fold in the pentapeptide platform
and the Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction of benzaldehyde
and ethyl acrylate in methanol enhanced 1.5-fold.

Introduction
Nature shows excellent
selectivity and efficiency within definite
compartments. Even microorganisms produce thousands of complicated
chemicals with extreme selectivity and almost zero chemical waste.1 Hence, the fabrication of biomimetic supramolecular
structures to facilitate organic syntheses in a confinement is highly
important for chemical research and industry.2−5 Nanoreactors are devices having
nanometer-size inner channel dimensions and which follow the main
features of microreactors such as high surface-area-to-volume ratio.
Hence, the outcome of a nanoreactor is higher in comparison to that
of a conventional reaction pot.6 The mixing
times (about several milliseconds) in nanoreactors are smaller than
those in conventional syntheses, and also, due to the nanoconfinement,
the diffusion times are very small. Thus, the effect of mass transport
on the speed of the reaction becomes reduced significantly and catalyzes
reactions with high selectivity.7 The very
small reaction volume in nanoreactors is also an advantage for technical
safety of toxic, explosive, and hazardous materials.8 It has been reported that the traditional organic reactions
such as fluorination,9 chlorination,10 nitration,11 hydrogenation,12 and oxidation13 can
be performed better in small confinements. Many chemical conversions
including additions,14 eliminations,15 nucleophilic substitutions,16 electrophilic substitutions,17 and cycloadditions18 have been carried
out with improved results in reactors.

Although nanostructure
reactors have been reported to optimize
many reactions, most of them have been used as catalyst,19 but they have not yet received the attention
they deserve for performing classical reactions. We are looking for
a nanoreactor that will act as a platform to facilitate the organic
reactions, like a microreactor that does not have catalytic activity
in the reaction process.20 Ryadnov has
reported a self-assembled peptide polynanoreactor having dendrimer
architecture.21 Thus, we have opted a supramolecular
peptide-based nanostructure21 as a platform
to carry out the traditional organic reactions like halogenations,
cycloaddition, and condensation.

Herein, we have synthesized
a pentapeptide, Boc–Phe–Phe–Aib-Phe–Phe–OMe
(1), containing l-phenylalanine and a central
α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) residue. X-ray crystallography
reveals that the pentapeptide adopts a 310-helical structure
with multiple i + 3 → i hydrogen bonding interactions. The
presence of Aib(3) residue at the central position might be beneficial
in inducing the helical structure. At higher-order packing, the peptide
forms a supramolecular helix-like structure with π-rich channels
by intermolecular hydrogen bonding as well. These π-rich channels
have been used as a potential platform to carry out the traditional
organic reactions. In the pentapeptide platform, bromination and iodination
of aniline take place without any halogen carrier (Lewis acid). Moreover,
the iodination reaction selectively synthesized p-iodoaniline. The Diels–Alder reaction between furan and maleic
anhydride increases 2-fold in the presence of the supramolecular nanoreactor
in chloroform solution, and the Morita–Baylis–Hillman
(MBH) reaction of benzaldehyde and ethyl acrylate in methanol enhanced
1.5-fold.

Results and Discussion
For pentapeptide 1 (Scheme 1), the design
principle explored was how
to use a conformationally rigid helicogenic Aib to develop a robust
peptide helix. The incorporation of four phenylalanine moieties helps
in creating a supramolecular channel with a rich π atmosphere
that could be utilized for some chemical transformations. Pentapeptide
Boc–Phe–Phe–Aib-Phe–Phe–OMe 1 was synthesized by conventional solution-phase methodology
using N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) as coupling
reagents. The synthesized peptide and the intermediates were purified
by column chromatography and characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), and mass spectrometry analyses.

Scheme 1 Schematic Presentation
of Pentapeptide Boc–Phe–Phe–Aib–Phe–Phe–OMe 1 and Its Folding into a Helix and Self-Assembly to a Supramolecular
Nanoreactor
To determine the conformational
features of pentapeptide 1 in solution, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments
were performed. The concentration-dependent 1H NMR experiment
in CDCl3 exhibits no shift of the amide protons with increasing
concentration, which indicates the existence of stable supramolecular
helices in solution (Figure 1a). On the other hand, small shifts of amide protons with
increasing temperature further indicate the stability of the pentapeptide 1 in solution (Supporting Information; Figure S1). Aib(3), Phe(4), and Phe(5) NH protons are intramolecularly
hydrogen-bonded as evident from their large chemical shift changes
upon heating (Figure 1a). Generally, addition of small amounts of a hydrogen-bond-accepting
solvent like DMSO-d6 in CDCl3 solution of peptide brings about monotonic downfield shifts of exposed
NH groups, leaving solvent-shielded NH groups almost unaffected.22 The effects of adding DMSO-d6 to CDCl3 solution of peptide 1 indicate that Phe(1) and Phe(2) NHs are solvent-exposed as it is
evident from their significant chemical shift changes (Δδ
0.56, 0.25 respectively) upon addition of DMSO-d6 in CDCl3 solutions (Figure 1b). Aib(3), Phe(4), and Phe(5) NHs exhibit
very little chemical shift changes (Δδ: 0.1, 0.012, and
0.002, respectively) even at higher percentages of DMSO-d6, which indicates that these NHs are involved in intramolecular
hydrogen bondings (Supporting Information; Figure S2). Table S1, Supporting Information,
shows Δδ values of all NHs for peptide 1.
We conclude that peptide 1 forms an intramolecularly
hydrogen-bonded helical structure in CDCl3 solution.22 Circular dichroism (CD) is an excellent method
to determine the backbone structural preferences of peptides. CD spectrum
of pentapeptide 1 in chloroform shows negative bands
at 208 and 214 nm (Supporting Information; Figure S3). This result further indicates that the peptide 1 forms an intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded stable helical conformation
in chloroform solution.

of NH chemical shifts of pentapeptide Boc–Phe–Phe–Aib–Phe–Phe–OMe 1 at varying concentrations of (CD3)2SO in CDCl3 solution.

We have investigated the structure of peptide 1 in
a solid state by the FT-IR technique. The FT-IR region 3500–3200
cm–1 is important for the N–H stretching
vibrations; however, the range 1800–1500 cm–1 is assigned for the stretching band of amide I and the bending peak
of amide II.23 For peptide 1, an intense band at 3319 cm–1 indicates the presence
of hydrogen-bonded NH groups (Supporting Information; Figure S4). The amide I and amide II bands appear
at 1658 and 1527 cm–1, respectively (Supporting
Information; Figure S4). The ester carbonyl
appears at 1736 cm–1. This suggests that the peptide 1 adopts a helical backbone conformation and all amide NHs
are hydrogen-bonded.23 To explore the molecular
conformation and self-assembly pattern of peptide 1,
single-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed. The monoclinic light
yellow crystals of 1 were obtained from 1,2-dichlorobenzene
solution by slow evaporation. There is one molecule of peptide 1 with two solvent (1,2-dichlorobenzene) molecules in the
asymmetric unit (Supporting Information; Figure S5).24 The solvent molecules (1,2-dichlorobenzene)
are held stabilized by π–π interactions with the
peptide molecule (shortest C–C distance 4.0 Å). Most of
the ϕ and ψ values of the residues are in the right-handed
helical region of the Ramachandran diagram. Important backbone torsional
angles are listed in Table S2; Supporting
Information. The peptide 1 adopts a right-handed 310-helical structure, stabilized by three intramolecular i
+ 3 → i N–H···O hydrogen bonds between
Aib NH and Boc C=O, Phe(4) NH and Phe(1) C=O, and Phe(5)
NH and Phe(2) C=O (Figure 2a). The structures obtained from the X-ray diffraction
study are consistent with the peptide conformation in solution. The
hydrogen bond parameters are listed in Table S3; Supporting Information. Although there are four Phe rings, there
is no π–π stacking in peptide 1. Rather,
the Phe rings are arranged on one side of the helical backbone and
form a π-rich channel (Figure 2b,c).

Figure 2 (a) 310-Helical backbone structure of peptide 1. (b) Arrangement of aromatic rings around the 310-helical backbone. (c) π-rich channel formed by peptide folding.

To gain insight into the role of solvents in pentapeptide 1 folding, we also tried crystallization of peptide 1 in a basic solvent such as aniline. Diffraction-quality
light yellow crystals of peptide 1 were obtained from
aniline by slow evaporation. Again, one molecule of pentapeptide 1 crystallized with two molecules of aniline in the asymmetric
unit (Figure 3a). There
is no change of the 310-helical peptide backbone by changing
solvent from 1,2-dichlorobenzene to aniline. One solvent unit is placed
in the molecular π-rich channel (Figure 3b) and the second one in the supramolecular
channel (Figure 3c).
The entrapped anilines are stabilized by T-shaped π–π
interactions between Phe(2) and aniline(1) (C-to-centroid distance,
3.51 Å) and NH−π interactions between the aniline
molecules (N-to-centroid distance, 3.21 Å).

Therefore, we have a rigid peptide platform with
a π-rich
channel, where we can incorporate the reagents like 1,2-dichlorobenzene
or aniline. We perform traditional organic reactions in these confinements.25,26 For the microreactor system, there are two main reaction categories:
biphasic (gas–liquid or gas–solid) and triphasic (gas–liquid–solid)
systems. We opt for a biphasic system. Traditionally, gas–liquid
mixing is achieved by pumping or purging gas into a solution.27 Modern approaches use membranes to dissolve
a gas in a liquid phase to effect reagent mixing.28 Here, we have passed reagent vapor through the crystals.
First, we have tried bromination of aniline inside the nanoreactor
in a solid state. Thus, we kept together bromine and dried peptide
crystals from aniline in a sealed container for 2 h and then removed
the excess bromine by simple evaporation. It was found that most of
the crystals ruptured into small pieces. We have performed mass spectrometry
of the resultant material, and the analysis revealed that the bromination
reaction has taken place and the major products were monobromoaniline,
tribromoaniline, and dibromoaniline (Supporting Information; Figure S6). The mass spectrum of the reaction
mixture after bromination also contains peptide 1 and
peptide 1 complexes with dibromoaniline. Therefore, due
to size exclusion, the products could not accommodate in the supramolecular
nanoreactor and hence ruptured the crystals. However, this gives a
proof of concept that the supramolecular nanoreactor can act as a
platform for the bromination reaction. Then, we tried the iodination
reaction. Hence, we kept together iodine (75 mg, 0.3 mmol) and the
dried peptide 1 crystals from aniline (10 mg, of which
aniline was 1.88 mg, 0.02 mmol, and peptide 1 was 8.12
mg, 0.01 mmol) in a sealed container for 2 h and then removed the
excess iodine by aerial evaporation. This time, we found that the
crystals are intact but light red in color. Mass spectrometry of the
reaction product revealed that the iodination reaction has taken place
and the major product is monoiodoaniline (Figure 4). Also, we have found the existence of peptide 1 from the mass spectrum (Figure 4), which implies that the iodine does not
react with the aromatic rings of peptide 1. The product
was purified by column chromatography using silica gel (100–200
mesh size) as the stationary phase and the n-hexane-ethyl
acetate mixture as eluent (isolated yield: 2.9 mg, 0.0132 mmol, 66%).
The corresponding NMR spectra confirmed the formation of 4-iodoaniline.
Therefore, the supramolecular nanoreactor can act as a platform for
the iodination reaction as well without any halogen carrier (Lewis
acid). We have tried to analyze the cocrystals obtained from iodination
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, but the data quality was not
good. However, the observed interactions between 4-iodoaniline and
aromatic rings of peptide 1 in two-dimensional NMR experiments
(Supporting Information; Figure S7) clearly
support the concept.

Figure 4 Mass spectrum of the pentapeptide 1 crystal

after passing iodine, showing the formation of monoiodoaniline. (Inset:
the crystals of pentapeptide 1 from aniline, before and
after iodination.)

In view of the fact that
the peptide 1 retains its
conformation in the solution state as well, we have used this reactor
in chloroform solution for the Diels–Alder reaction between
furan and maleic anhydride (Figure 5a).29 At the beginning,
we have observed that maleic anhydride got dissolved immediately in
the reaction vial containing peptide 1. On the other
hand, it took few minutes to dissolve in the reaction vial without
peptide 1. This indicates that the maleic anhydride molecules
first occupy the π-rich channels (the positions occupied by
the solvent molecules in the crystals) of the pentapeptide 1 and then undergo the Diels–Alder reaction with furan molecules.
The interaction has been confirmed by the 1H NMR titration
by gradual addition of peptide 1 to the solution of maleic
anhydride in CDCl3 (Supporting Information, Figure S8), where we observed a downfield shift
(Δδ 0.0038). We also performed the diffusion-ordered spectroscopy
experiment for maleic anhydride (166 mM) and the maleic anhydride–peptide 1 mixture (166 and 10 mM, respectively) and observed a significant
decrease in the value of diffusion coefficient for the mixture (Supporting
Information; Figure S9). This result further
confirms the interaction of maleic anhydride with peptide 1. In chloroform, the Diels–Alder reaction between furan and
maleic anhydride increases 2-fold in the presence of the nanoreactor 1 (Figure 5a) and the exo-product was found to form exclusively. However, the
Diels–Alder reaction between furan and maleic anhydride in
the presence of the supramolecular reactor in toluene has been found
to be facilitated more as the solid product gets precipitated out
of the solution during the course of the reaction (Figure 5b). Finally, we have used the
peptide 1 reactor for the Morita–Baylis–Hillman
(MBH) reaction between benzaldehyde and ethyl acrylate in methanol
in the presence of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO).30 The MBH reaction of benzaldehyde and ethyl acrylate
in methanol increases 1.5-fold in the presence of the supramolecular
nanoreactor 1 (Figure 5c) in 96 h. The experimental details are given in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
synthesized a pentapeptide Boc–Phe–Phe–Aib-Phe–Phe–OMe 1 with l-phenylalanine and a central α-aminoisobutyric
acid (Aib). The pentapeptide adopts a robust 310-helical
structure. The Aib residue at the central position helps to induce
the overall helical structure. At higher-order packing, the pentapeptide 1 forms a supramolecular helical structure by intermolecular
hydrogen bonding as well as π–π stacking interactions.
Conformational analysis by various NMR experiments further confirms the presence of the robust
helical structure in the solution state as well. The pentapeptide 1 is able to accommodate reagents in its molecular and supramolecular
channels. These π-rich channels have been used as a potential
platform for the organic reactions. The halogenations of aniline take
place without any halogen carrier (Lewis acid), and the Diels–Alder
reaction between furan and maleic anhydride increases 2-fold in nanoreactor 1. The MBH reaction of benzaldehyde and ethyl acrylate increases
1.5-fold in pentapeptide nanoreactor 1. Overall, these
studies offer new opportunities to carry out traditional organic transformations
in nanoconfinements.

Peptide Synthesis
All of the peptides (3, 6, and 1)
were synthesized (Scheme S1) by conventional
solution-phase methods using a racemization-free fragment condensation
strategy. The Boc group was used for N-terminal protection, and the
C-terminus was protected as a methyl ester. Deprotections of methyl
ester were performed using the saponification method. Couplings were
mediated by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCC/HOBt). The intermediates were
characterized by 500 MHz Brüker AVANCE and 400 MHz JEOL 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectrometers. The final compound
was fully characterized by 400 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy (100 MHz), FT-IR spectroscopy, and single-crystal
X-ray diffraction analysis.

in 20 mL of dry DCM in an ice-water bath. Compound 4 (1.3
g, 4 mmol) was isolated from the corresponding salt by neutralization.
It was then added to the reaction mixture, followed immediately by
0.61 g (2.93 mmol) of DCC and 0.4 g (2.93 mmol) of HOBt. The reaction
mixture was allowed to come to room temperature and stirred for 48
h. DCM was evaporated, the residue was taken in ethyl acetate (30
mL), and DCU was filtered off. The organic layer was washed with 2
M HCl (3 × 20 mL) and brine (2 × 20 mL) and 1 M sodium carbonate
(3 × 20 mL) and brine (2 × 20 mL), dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate, and evaporated in vacuum to yield peptide 1 as a white solid. The product was purified by silica gel (100–200
mesh) using n-hexane–ethyl acetate (1:1) as
eluent. Yield: 1.52 g (1.89 mmol, 64.5%).

4-Iodoaniline
Dried peptide 1 crystals
from aniline (10 mg, of which aniline was 1.88 mg, 0.02 mmol, and
peptide 1 was 8.12 mg, 0.01 mmol) and iodine (75 mg,
0.3 mmol) were kept together in a sealed container for 2 h, and then
the excess iodine was removed by aerial evaporation. The product was
purified by column chromatography using silica gel (100–200
mesh size) as the stationary phase and the n-hexane–ethyl
acetate mixture as eluent. Isolated yield: 2.90 mg (0.0132 mmol, 66%).

[2H, m, ArH], 6.46–6.49 [2H, m, ArH], 3.71 [2H, b, NH2] (Figure S27). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, δ ppm): 146.03, 137.9, 117.26, 79.4 (Figure S28).

Diels–Alder Reaction
A mixture of 10 mg (0.1
mmol) of maleic anhydride and 5 mg (0.006 mmol) of peptide 1 was dissolved in 0.6 mL of CDCl3 in an NMR tube, i.e.,
maleic anhydride, 166.67 mM and peptide 1, 10 mM. To
this solution, 11 μL (0.15 mmol) of furan was added, and the
sealed NMR tube was subjected to the Diels–Alder reaction at
40 °C in a water bath. A second set of the same reaction was
run in the identical condition in the absence of peptide catalyst
(control). Both the reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy at
different time intervals. After 24 h, products of the reaction tubes
were extracted and purified by column chromatography using silica
gel (mesh size 100–200) as the stationary phase and the n-hexane–ethyl acetate mixture as eluent. Isolated
yields: 10.6 mg, 0.064 mmol, 64% (in presence of peptide 1) and 5.4 mg, 0.0325 mmol, 32.5% (in the absence of peptide 1).

When the same reactions were carried out in toluene,
we observed more than 3 times increase in the reaction in the presence
of peptide 1 after 8 h. Isolated yields: 9.8 mg, 0.059
mmol, 59% (in presence of peptide 1, Figure S10) and 3.2 mg, 0.0193 mmol, 19.3% (in the absence
of peptide 1, Figure S11).

Morita–Baylis–Hillman Reaction
A mixture
of 51 μL (0.5 mmol) of benzaldehyde, 0.2 mL (1.88 mmol) of ethyl
acrylate, 56 mg (0.5 mmol) of 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO),
and 20 mg (0.024 mmol) of peptide 1 was dissolved in
1 mL of methanol in a 5 mL reaction vial, and the Morita–Baylis–Hillman
(MBH) reaction was carried out by normal stirring at room temperature
(20 °C). A second set of the same reaction was run in the identical
conditions in the absence of peptide 1 (control). Both
the reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy at different time
intervals by dissolving 30 μL of the reaction mixture in 0.5
mL of CDCl3. After 5 days, products of the reaction vials
were extracted and purified by column chromatography using silica
gel (mesh size 100–200) as the stationary phase and the n-hexane–ethyl acetate mixture as eluent. Isolated
yields: 78.1 mg, 0.379 mmol, 75.8% (in the presence of peptide 1, Figure S12) and 61.8 mg, 0.3
mmol, 60% (in the absence of peptide 1, Figure S12).

NMR Experiments
All NMR studies
were carried out on
Brüker AVANCE 500 MHz and JEOL 400 MHz spectrometers at 298
K. Compound concentrations were in the range 1–10 mM in CDCl3 and (CD3)2SO.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
Solid-state FT-IR spectrum was obtained
with a PerkinElmer Spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer with the KBr disk
technique.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Study
Intensity data
of the reported peptide was collected with Mo Kα radiation using
a Bruker APEX-2 CCD diffractometer. Data was processed using the Bruker
SAINT package, and the structure solution and refinement procedures
were performed using SHELX97.

Circular Dichroism (CD)
Spectroscopy
The conformational
preference of the reported peptide in chloroform was detected by CD
spectroscopy. The peptide was dissolved in chloroform, taken in a
cell of path length 1.0 mm, and measured in a JASCO J-815-150S instrument
at a temperature of 25 °C.
