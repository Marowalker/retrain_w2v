Since
the early 20th century, the slightly disparate measurements
of a surfactant’s critical micelle concentration, via either
surface tension or electrical conductivity, have been assumed one
and the same. As a consequence, the possibility that micelles can
adsorb at the air/water surface has been disregarded and has led to
some abnormalities in the literature that remain as yet unresolved.
In this paper, we closely examined the two critical concentrations
for a double-chain cationic surfactant. We confirmed that the two
concentrations represent two different physical phenomena. Furthermore,
the results verified the existence of surface micelles, which are
different from the bulk micelles. The formation of the surface micelles
can be explained by the structural changes of the adsorption layer,
which was also corroborated by molecular simulations. The findings
open new challenges to examine the surface adsorption, which  offers new
insights into the molecular levels.

Introduction
In surfactant studies,
the critical micellization concentration
(cmc) is an important measure for surfactant characterization. The
cmc is often used as the effective concentration threshold for practical
applications.1 In the literature, the cmc
is often measured via either surface tension or electrical conductivity,
these being the two oldest and simplest methods. Furthermore, these
two methods can be done without additional chemical probes, which
can interfere with the micellization process.2

The first method (surface tension) is based on the surface
properties
of the sample, whereas the second method (conductivity) is based on
the properties in the bulk. The two values, denoted here as ccs and ccc, respectively,
are demonstrated in Figure 1. In both cases, the cmc is defined as the breakpoint in the
measured variable with respect to concentration.

Changes in conductivity provided the first evidence
of aggregate
existence, which were originally thought of as the associated form
of the surfactant.3 Subsequently, it was
argued that the aggregates consist of multiple molecules and counterions
and are referred to as “micelles”.4 It should be noted that there is a wide transition region
between the two linear trends in the conductivity data. Consequently,
complicated mathematical treatments can be applied instead of linear
regression5 to improve the precision in
identifying the breakpoint. With surface tension data, determination
of the breakpoint remains almost the same as it was a century ago.1

After earlier reports with anionic surfactants,6 most studies in the literature assumed that the
two measurements
of the critical micelle concentration held the same physical meaning,
attributing the variance in the values to artifacts of the measurement
method. This assumption allowed surfactant studies to be significantly
simplified. The main consequences can be found in the hypotheses in
now-common texts:(1) Surface activity (or surface tension
reduction) is governed by the monomer only, not aggregates/micelles.1

(2) The saturation of the surface layer
corresponds to interfacial saturation of the monomer. All excessive
surfactant molecules form micelles and do not affect the surface layer.7

(3) These same arguments apply equally
to oil/water and solid/water interfaces.



In summary, if the two concentrations (ccs and ccc) are the same, it follows that
micelles have no impact on the surface layer. Yet, this assumption
has not been verified. Seven decades ago, Lottermoser and Stoll proposed
that micelles can quantitatively interact with the adsorbed monomer
and affect the surface tension.8 Subsequently,
Powney and Addison6 argued that micelles
may indirectly affect surface tension by increasing the concentration
of the free counterions (as micelles are not neutrally charged and
their balancing counterions remains dissociated in the bulk). Later
on, Israelachvili has showed theoretically that “hemimicelles”
can exist at the air/water interface.9 Recent
studies on adsorbed surfactants at the air/water surface have indicated
that micelles can cause a deviation between the obtained adsorption
and the theoretical prediction from the Gibbs adsorption equation,
occurring at as low as 80% of cmc.10 Our
previous tension model also demonstrated the failure of the conventional
model near the cmc.11 More recently, Rusanov
looked closely at the surface tension near cmc of cationic and nonionic
surfactants and concluded that the micelles can slightly reduce surface
tension above cmc.12 Collectively, the
available reports suggested that micelles have a certain impact on
the surface tension above cmc. Yet, under what conditions will micelles
start interacting with surface tension? Furthermore, is there any
quantitative evidence of such an impact?

This short paper addresses
the above two questions. First, we re-examine
the reported data for cmc measurement of common cationic surfactants.
Subsequently, we present evidence that the two values are not the
same. More importantly, we confirm the measurable impact of micelles
on surface tension. Finally, the consequences, in both fundamental
knowledge and practical application, are discussed.

Analysis
While the last century has seen many reports in the literature
of discrepancies in the cmc measured by different methods, the difference
could be caused by impurities or measurement errors. Hence, we only
list the studies in which both reported values were obtained from
the same sample (Table 1). The two values are denoted as ccs (from
surface tension measurement) and ccc (from
conductivity measurement). Because the reported cmc for all ionic
surfactant are enormous (Rosen has compiled a long table of 16 pages),1 we will restrict ourselves to the cationic surfactants
with trimethyl ammonium as the head group. It should be noted that
the results in Table 1 were obtained within the last 20 years and employed the latest apparatuses.

Statistically, the reported values cannot
confirm the hypothesis
that ccc = ccs. The most profound difference was reported by Menger and Shi, in
which ccc was 10 times higher than ccs.17 The result
subsequently led to the debate on the applications of the Gibbs excess
adsorption and surface tension.18 It is
noteworthy that this large deviation (Figure 1b) was obtained for the mixture of C12H25(CH3)3NBr and a trianionic
compound, rather than a single surfactant.

In this paper, we
confirm the difference with another cationic
surfactant, a double-chain surfactant with dimethylammonium as the
head group. This class of surfactants has two distinct breakpoints
in surface tension.16,19 The synthesis and measurement
of the surfactant hexadecyldimethyldodecyl ammonium bromide, C16H33C12H25(CH3)2NBr, are described in the Supporting Information. In addition to the surface tension and conductivity
measurements, a simulation of the surfactant at the air/water interface
was also carried out. The results (Figure 2a) clearly show two critical concentrations
from surface tension, consistent with previous reports.19 With conductivity results (Figure 2b), it is clear that ccs1 < ccc < ccs2. The relative differences between these
critical concentrations were more than three times. An analysis with
symmetric double-chain surfactant, C12H25C12H25(CH3)2NCl,20 also indicated that ccc was ∼3ccs1 (whereas ccs2 was non-detectable).

Figure 2 Surface tension (a) and conductivity (b)
of hexadecyldimethyldodecyl
ammonium bromide. Critical concentrations: ccs1 = 3.1 × 10–6 M, ccs2 = 1.1 × 10–4 M and ccc = 3.9 × 10–5 M.

The reduction of surface tension
between ccs1 and ccs2 indicates that the
aggregate(s) have a quantifiable effect on the surface tension. Here,
we propose a possible mechanism, as illustrated in Figure 3: the formation of surface
micellization. In this instance, surface micelles are formed when
monomers from the bulk aggregate together with surfactant molecules
on the surface. The micelles should have an asymmetric shape, such
as a “hemisphere”, as predicted theoretically by Israelachvili.9 The existence of “hemimicelles”
on solid surfaces has been well-accepted21 and directly observed well below the ccc.22 At the air/water surface, the surface
micelles reduce surface tension by re-arranging the surfactant monolayer.
Because of the steric repulsion between the two tails, adsorbed monolayer
of the surfactants have a looser packing, in comparison with single-chain
surfactants. The notion that both tails of the surfactant are pointing
to air phase was originated from the molecular simulation (Figure 4). It can be seen
that the ends of both (CH3– group) are clearly in
the air/phase, ∼0.5 nm from the Gibbs dividing plane. As a
result of the looser packing, the surface tension of double-tailed
surfactant is higher than that of the single-tailed surfactant. Experimentally,
the surface tension of C16H33C12H25(CH3)2NBr at cs1 (Figure 2a) was 40 mN/m, which is ∼7 mN/m higher than the surface tension
at the cmc of C16TAB. Unfortunately, we cannot simulate
the surface micelle formation because of the limited computing capacity.
It has been verified that the simulation of bulk aggregates would
require a timescale of 50 ns and simulation cell of more than 5 nm.21 For the surface micelles, the simulation box
and time would be much larger to correctly simulate the unfolding
of the carbon chains and fluctuation of the surface.23

Figure 3 Proposed mechanisms of micelles/surface tension interaction: “surface
micelle” and “adsorbed micelle”. The shaded areas
represent the “hydrophobic core” of the micelles.

Figure 4 Density distribution of double-tailed surfactant
at air/water interface,
the Gibbs dividing plane was determined from water profile.

Previously, it has been proposed
that the bulk micelles of double-tailed
surfactants could consist of a combination of different size, from
dimers and trimers to large bilayer vesicles.24 Hence, one might expect that the surface micelles can exist in a
range of different size as well. Qualitatively, there is a key difference
between the surface and bulk micelles. The bulk micelles of double-chains
surfactants can contain both tails, especially when the second tail
is longer than six carbons.25 The proposed
surface micelles, in contrast, should contain a single chain only.
The surface micelles are formed at much lower concentration (cs1) than the bulk micelle. In this case, the
adsorbed monolayer acts as “seeds” to lower the required
entropy for aggregation. The relative ease between surface/bulk micelle
formation is similar to heterogeneous/homogeneous nucleation. The
surface micelles reach saturation at cs2, above which all excessive surfactants form bulk micelles.

Discussion
and Conclusion
The critical insight from this double-tailed
surfactant is that
the impact of micelles on surface tension can be significant enough
to be measurable. The tension difference between ccs1 and ccs2 was more than
15 mN/m. On the other hand, the reduction of single-chain C12TAB micelles was about 0.5 mN/m,26 which
is in same order of the measurement errors. The difference was systematically
observed for a large number double-chain surfactants with long hydrophobic
tails.19 The second tail of the surfactant
clearly plays a critical role in the surface aggregation and surface
tension reduction. As this branch gets shortened, the tension difference
between ccs1 and ccs2 is gradually diminished.19 Eventually,
the surfactant is reduced to C16TAB and the impact of micelles
on surface tension becomes unobservable. Nevertheless, the micelles
of C16TAB can still affect the adsorbed surfactants at
the surface, as reported via neutron reflectometry.10 The reduction was also smaller when the longer chain was
reduced from 16 to 1419 or 12 carbons.16 For these double-chain surfactants, ccs2 is the true threshold for surface saturation,
which comprises a multilayer arrangement. While the available experimental
techniques might not be able to distinguish the surface micelles,9 one might rely on the theoretical model or simulation.
There are a number of mathematical formulae to model the gradual tension
reduction by the surface micelles. For example, one of the possibilities
is the theoretical combination of mass action law and Gibbs adsorption
equation.12 Furthermore, the formation/adsorption
of the surface micelles can be further examined by extending the molecular
simulations.

The observation can be expected with other surfactant
types of
double-chain surfactants, either anionic or nonionic ones. Furthermore,
the phenomena can be applicable to the famous double-chain structure,
gemini surfactants.27 For these surfactants,
the two tails are attached to two separate heads, which are distanced
by a short alkanediyl spacer, CsH2s. The geminis
can be synthesized with many different head-groups and have many advantages
over the single-chain surfactants.28 For
the gemini structure, however, the spacer between head-groups plays
a crucial role. Available reports with the dimethylammonium bromides29 showed that the conductivity-based cmc increased
with the spacer length initially and then decreased once the spacer
is greater than 5 carbons. Hence, it can be expected that the
short-spaced geminis behave as the double-chain surfactant in this
study, that is, forming distinct surface micelles. The long-spaced
geminis, in contrast, should behave as single-chain surfactants.

In conclusion, the results showed that micelles can be formed at
the surface surfactant layer, independently from the bulk micelles.
Most importantly, the two measured critical concentrations correspond
explicitly to different physical phenomena. To account for the differences,
the surface tension should be modeled by considering a real interfacial
zone with multiple molecular arrangements between different species.
The value of ccs2 should be referred to
as the “critical surface concentration”, at which point
the air/water surface is truly saturated. As micelles can interfere
with the surfactant monolayer, the saturation concentration might
be different from corresponding oil/water and solid/water surfaces.
Hence, the saturation thresholds of surfactants should be evaluated
against the specific surface, rather than using the conductivity data.
