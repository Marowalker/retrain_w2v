Most
therapeutic targets are proteins whose binding sites are hydrophobic
cavities. For this reason, the majority of drugs under development
are hydrophobic molecules exhibiting low solubility in water. To tackle
this issue, a few percent of cosolvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), is usually employed to increase drug solubility during the
drug screening process. However, the few published studies dealing
with the effect of adding DMSO showed that the affinity of hydrophobic
ligands is systematically underestimated. To better understand the
effect of DMSO, there is a need of studying its effect on a large
range of systems. In this work, we used β- and γ-cyclodextrins
(made of 6 and 7 α-d-glucopyranoside units, respectively)
as models of hydrophobic cavities to investigate the effect of the
addition 5% DMSO on the affinity of 1-adamantane carboxylic acid (ADA)
to these cyclodextrins. The two systems differ by the size of the
cyclodextrin cavity. The evaluation of binding constants was performed
using ultrasound velocimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
and molecular simulations. All techniques show that the presence of
5% DMSO does not significantly modify the affinity of ADA for γ-cyclodextrin,
while the affinity is dramatically reduced for β-cyclodextrin.
The bias induced by the presence of DMSO is thus more important when
the ligand volume better fits the cyclodextrin cavity. Our work also
suggests that free energy calculations provide a sound alternative
to experimental techniques when dealing with poorly water-soluble
drugs.

Introduction
The majority of drugs
are small ligands whose purpose is to bind
therapeutic targets, mostly proteins.1,2 Because most
of the newly discovered targeted binding sites are small hydrophobic
pockets located in proteins,3,4 drugs under development
are also mainly hydrophobic.5 To deal with
this increasing number of poorly water-soluble drugs,5 new strategies have to be developed for drug discovery
and delivery.6 Most of them rely on the
use of specific molecules that help solubilize the insoluble drugs.
Among these molecules, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used as
a cosolvent due to its known ability to readily dissolve a wide range
of compounds, including hydrophobic molecules. DMSO is particularly
used during the drug discovery process in screening techniques such
as cell-based assays or high-throughput screening.7 These techniques allow rapid identification of active compounds,
antibodies, or genes of therapeutic interest. Once a therapeutic target
is identified, the goal consists in selecting the ligands with the
highest affinity for the designated target. Hydrophobic drugs are
first solubilized in a 100% DMSO solution, then titrated to an aqueous
solution containing the therapeutic protein target so that the volume
fraction of DMSO is on the order of a few percent. Indeed, exceeding
10% of DMSO volume concentration is known to unfold proteins8−10 as well as to induce cell death.11 Thus,
the ligand affinity is systematically evaluated in the presence of
less than 10% of DMSO. Surprisingly, the literature dealing with the
effect of a small addition of DMSO on binding constant measurements
is sparse. It may be because measuring the binding constant of poorly
water-soluble or insoluble drugs in the absence of a cosolvent is
challenging, as most techniques require a drug concentration significantly
higher than the solubility of the drug. The few experimental articles12−15 systematically measured binding constants that are weakened in the
presence of DMSO compared to values performed without it. Hence, screening
techniques that use DMSO most likely underestimate the efficiency
of hydrophobic drug candidates. Consequently, there is an urgent need
either better quantifying the effect of DMSO to be able to correct
its effect on a given system, or using new approaches to evaluate
binding constants without the need for a cosolvent. In this context,
cyclodextrins represent an attractive model to investigate the effect
of a cosolvent in binding events at a hydrophobic site. They are small
molecules made of six to eight glucopyranose units assembled into
a truncated cone shape, the inner hydrophobic cavity of which can
accommodate various small hydrophobic molecules. Their inner cavity
can be considered as a simplistic model of a hydrophobic pocket found
in proteins of pharmaceutical interest. Moreover, cyclodextrins are
widely used in commercial formulations to encapsulate hydrophobic
drugs.5,16,17 Similarly
to drug screening techniques, the production of cyclodextrin based
formulations requires the use of a cosolvent to form the hydrophobic
drug–cyclodextrin complex. The choice of the cosolvent is a
balance between improving the solubility of the hydrophobic drug and
decreasing its affinity for cyclodextrins. Because this balance is
difficult to predict, most medicinal products contain a majority of
empty cyclodextrins, hence leading to less efficient formulations.
The understanding of the effect of cosolvents on the binding of cyclodextrins
should at the same time help optimize cyclodextrin based formulations
as well as predict the affinity of hydrophobic ligands with more accuracy
during the drug discovery process. In this article, we have investigated
using experimental and numerical techniques the difference in binding
constant of a hydrophobic ligand for β- and γ-cyclodextrins
performed with or without 5% DMSO, which is a typical concentration
employed in screening techniques (i.e., in the range of 1–10%).
To the best of our knowledge, the effect of a few percent of DMSO
on the binding of chemically unmodified cyclodextrins has never been
investigated. All previous studies dealt with large concentrations,
ranging from 25% to 100% DMSO.18−20

Results
Sound Velocity
Measurements
The effect of 5% DMSO (v/v)
on the binding of 1-adamantane carboxylic acid (ADA) to β- and
γ-cyclodextrin (β- and γ-CD) was investigated at
25 °C. This system was previously studied in aqueous solution21,22 as well as in the presence of various osmolytes,23 except DMSO. Many studies demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry
for the complexes of ADA with β- and γ-CD.23−25 In particular, the number of water molecules leaving the hydration
shell of ADA and β-CD after their binding were determined to
be 20–25 water molecules from sound velocity measurements,21 which are known to be extremely sensitive to
changes in hydration.26 Indeed, the strength
of a ligand affinity is proportional to the number of solvent molecules
released from the solvation shell of the binding sites and to the
energetic frustration experienced by these molecules, which would
prefer going to the bulk than staying in the solvation shell of hydrophobic
solutes. This frustration is reduced when the physical properties
between solvent molecules in the solvation shell and in the bulk are
closer. Thereby, we first measured the sound velocities, U and Uo, of an ADA solution and of its
solvent (either made of an aqueous buffer with or without 5% DMSO),
respectively. Both velocities were measured each time a titration
was performed using the same CD solution. For each titration, we calculated
the increment of sound velocity [U] = (Uo – U)/(Uo[ADA]), where [ADA] is the ADA molar concentration. The values
of Δ[U](r) = [U](r) – [U](0) are plotted
in Figure 1 as a function
of the molar ratio r = [CD]/[ADA], where [CD] is
the molar concentration of added CD. The variation of Δ[U](r) is mainly due to a change in the
properties of solvent molecules (water or DMSO) that are released
from the binding sites due to the ADA binding to CD. The Newton–Laplace
equation, βS = 1/(ρU2) relates the sound velocity U to the coefficient
of adiabatic compressibility βS and the density ρ.
Since changes in compressibility are much larger than that of density,21,22 we can consider that Δ[U](r) is mainly a reflection of compressibility changes in solvent molecules
that no longer hydrate the binding sites. It can be fitted to the
following equation: 1  where α(r) is the molar
fraction of bound ADA and [U](∞) is the value
at r = ∞. Knowing that β- and γ-CD
bind only one ADA, we can easily relate α(r) to the binding constant Kb (see eq 3). A fit of the γ-CD
data in buffer leads to a binding constant Kb = (340 ± 25) M–1, in good agreement
with a published value, (324 ± 11) M–1, also
measured using sound velocity.22 The binding
constant slightly increased to (509 ± 50) M–1 in the presence of 5% DMSO. For β-cyclodextrin, we derived
in buffer a value Kb = (5700 ± 3000)
M–1, whereas we could not observe a significant
variation for [U](r) in the presence
of 5% DMSO. The Kb values can be easily
converted into a change of Gibbs free energy ΔG = −RT ln(Kb) (where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature, that is, 298 K) accompanying the binding
event (see Table 1).
As Kb varies exponentially, small variations
in entropy (ΔS) or enthalpy
(ΔH) can lead to huge variations
in Kb, whereas ΔG = ΔH – TΔS does not overexpress
these energetic variations. Since Kb and
ΔG are equally employed and
given in the literature, we will provide both values. When considering
the binding free energy ΔG, the ADA to γ-CD binding is only (1 ± 0.4) kJ mol–1 more stable in 5% DMSO than in buffer (see Table 1). For β-CD,
the lack of significant velocity variation in the presence of DMSO
can be due, according to eq 1, to a negligible value of Kb or
of |[U](∞)| or both. The latter scenario is
most probable since for γ-CD we observe that the addition of
DMSO reduces the difference [U](0) – [U](∞) (see Figure 1), that is, the difference between compressibilities
of solvents in the bulk and in the solvation shell of ADA and CD binding
sites. So if the same phenomenon occurred for β-CD, it would
have led to a different value, [U](0) – [U](∞), smaller than the detection threshold of the
velocimetry technique (which can be estimated around 8 cm3 mol–1).

(b, d) correspond to measurements performed in buffer and in 5% DMSO
buffer, respectively. The various colors correspond to different titration
measurements.

Another technique is
needed to confirm the above scenario. In binding
studies, the technique of choice is isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC). Unfortunately, this technique provided unreproducible results
when performing titration measurements on solution containing 5% DMSO.
In this respect, Fotiadou et al.27 also
could not get reproducible results on cyclodextrin derivatives when
using 80% DMSO “due to ground noise coming from a strong DMSO–water
exothermic association which is very much dependent on the exact composition
of the mixture”. For this reason, the authors performed only
measurements in pure DMSO. Thus, we used a more adapted method, that
is, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique.

Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Measurements
We performed
NMR measurements in which water and DMSO were deuterated. Stock solutions
of cyclodextrins were prepared in deuterated buffers with or without
the presence of 5% DMSO-d6. ADA stock
solution was prepared by solubilizing ADA in a volume of CD stock
solution. Then, samples were prepared by mixing a volume of CD stock
solution with another volume of ADA stock solution, so that the CD
concentration remains constant through all samples, while AD concentration
is diluted. For each sample, we monitored the chemical shift of the
peak signal ascribed to hydrogen atoms of cyclodextrin (see Figure S1). In good agreement with other publications,28,29 the H3 and H5 protons, located inside the CD cavity, are the most
affected by the ADA inclusion, while the H6 proton, which is located
at the edge of the smaller opening face is weakly shifted. In contrast,
the chemical shifts of protons located outside the cavity (i.e., H1,
H2, and H4) weakly change upon complexation (data not shown). In this
context, we only considered the H3 and H5 protons in our NMR analysis.
The variations of the chemical shifts were plotted as a function of
[ADA] (see Figure 2). In a one-to-one stoichiometry as expected in our systems, these
variations must behave linearly according to Scott’s equation:28,30 2  where Δδobs represents
the observed chemical shift difference of CD proton H3 or H5 between
free CD and CD + ADA complexes and Δδmax is
the chemical shift difference at saturation. Since a linear behavior
was indeed observed in all our figures, we could extract the apparent
binding constant Kb by fitting the NMR
data to eq 2. For γ-CD,
the data based on H3 protons shows that Kb slightly decreases from (236 ± 10) M–1 to
(148 ± 7) M–1 when 5% DMSO is added, while Kb is almost constant when considering H5 protons
(see Table 1). For
data derived from H3 protons, this corresponds to a slight increase
in free energy of about 1.1 ± 0.3 kJ mol–1,
from (−13.5 ± 0.1) to (−12.4 ± 0.1) kJ mol–1, while this change is null for H5 protons. These
variations are different from what has been measured by sound velocity
(a slight decrease in free energy), but we can consider that both
NMR and velocity techniques measured only small changes upon the addition
of DMSO. Note also that the two techniques do not probe the same observables:
for sound velocity the change in properties of solvents released from
the solvation shell of binding sites is monitored, whereas for NMR
the change in the chemical environment of two cyclodextrin proton
types is monitored. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the H5 proton
of β-CD is the most sensitive to ADA complexation. The latter
protons are located in the interior cavity of CD close to the narrower
rim. As there is no chemical shift assigned to H6 protons, this result
suggests that ADA inclusion reaches the H5 protons but not the H6
ones. However, the Kb estimation is obviously
more precise for H3 protons than for H5 protons, for which broadened
and shape-changing NMR signal over the range of low concentration
conditions (data not shown) can hamper an accurate estimation of the
chemical shift. For β-CD, we succeeded to measure a binding
constant in the solution containing 5% DMSO; this value is equal to
(172 ± 18) M–1 for H3 protons and (44 ±
8) M–1 for H5 protons, while in buffer we measured,
respectively, (3200 ± 150) M–1 for H3 protons
and (710 ± 38) M–1 for H5 protons. We observe
for both proton types a 17 times decrease in Kb values upon the addition of DMSO, while the value for H3
protons is closest to the value derived from sound velocity. Although Kb is reduced by the presence of DMSO, it still
exhibits a significant value that should have been detectable by previous
velocity measurements, which demonstrates that the value of [U](0) – [U](∞) has to be
very small in the presence of DMSO. The observed variation in Kb corresponds to a significant difference in
free energy ΔG of about 7
kJ mol–1, with values increasing from (−20.0
± 0.1) kJ mol–1 in buffer to (−12.8
± 0.3) kJ mol–1 in DMSO based on H3 proton
and from (−16.3 ± 0.1) kJ mol–1 to (−9.4
± 0.3) kJ mol–1 based on H5 proton.

the various colored symbols correspond to different titration measurements
where the values of [ADA]/Δδobs were obtained

with γ-cylcodextrin and the bottom panels (c, d) with β-cylcodextrin,
while the left column (a, c) deals with experiments in buffer and
the right column (b, d) in the presence of 5% DMSO.

Molecular Simulations and Free Energy Calculations
Molecular simulations allow the evaluation of the binding free
energy
using so-called “alchemical” approaches.31 It consists in calculating the free energy of
the simulated complex (see Figure S2) via
a suitable thermodynamic cycle involving alchemical transformations
(i.e., by decoupling nonbonded interactions of the ligand from its
environment). Using this method, we obtained the change in free energy
associated with the binding of ADA to CD. However, one has to bear
in mind that the accuracy of such calculations relies on the force
field. It is especially challenging when it comes to carbohydrate
molecules such as cyclodextrins. In the literature, some simulation
studies assessing the effects of solvents on the deformation of cyclodextrins
were published recently.32,33 The one from Zhang
et al.32 used the GLYCAM0634 (derived from AMBER) while the other from Khuntawee et
al.33 used the GROMOS 53A6 for carbohydrates.35 Both studies revealed that the flexibility of
the cyclodextrin depends not only on the solvent used but also on
the ligand.

Here we used the GROMOS 53A6GLYC force
field36 which is an update of GROMOS 53A6.
The systems we simulated consisted of a box containing either a β
or γ-cyclodextrin bound to an adamantane carboxylic acid and
solubilized either in water or in water with 5% DMSO (together with
a sodium ion to keep the complex neutral). Of note, all free energy
values ΔG presented here were
corrected for finite-size and discrete solvent effects due to the
net charge of ADA (i.e., −1) (see SI). In all cases, the corrections were quite small (about 1 kJ mol–1 or lower). When DMSO molecules are present, they
solvate the cavities of both β- and γ-CD before their
complexation with ADA. For γ-CD, we calculated a change in free
energy, ΔG, associated with
the binding equal to (−14.4 ± 0.9) kJ mol–1 in buffer and (−11.4 ± 1.3) kJ mol–1 in 5% DMSO. This gives a difference of 3 kJ mol–1, which is closer to the variation observed for H3 atoms in our NMR
experimental data (1.1 kJ mol–1) and confirms the
fact that DMSO does not significantly modify the affinity of ADA for
γ-CD. In terms of binding constants, it means that Kb = exp −(ΔG/(RT)) is equal to (348 ± 141) M–1 in water and (109 ± 59) M–1 in the presence
of 5% DMSO. For β-cyclodextrin, ΔG equals (−16.8 ± 0.5) kJ mol–1 in water and (−8.1 ± 3.2) kJ mol–1 in DMSO. This increase of 8.7 kJ mol–1 in free
energy upon DMSO addition also agrees very well with NMR measurements.
From these free energy values, we conclude that the binding constant
is reduced from (882 ± 180) to (47 ± 57) M–1 upon the addition of 5% DMSO. We also performed the same calculations
without restraining the movement of ADA. Similar free energy values
were obtained, that is, (−17 ± 2) kJ mol–1 in buffer and (−7 ± 3) kJ mol–1 in
5% DMSO for γ-CD, while for β-CD we have (−14 ±
3) kJ mol–1 in buffer and (−9 ± 1) kJ
mol–1 in 5% DMSO.

Discussion
From
our experimental and simulation results, we conclude that
the presence of 5% DMSO significantly decreases the affinity of ADA
for β-CD, while its effect is marginal on ADA affinity for γ-CD.
The decrease in ADA affinity for β-CD is consistent with published
works performed using other ligands at higher volume concentration
of DMSO. For instance, Siegel and Breslow18 showed that the binding of β-CD with m-tert-butylphenyl acetate becomes weaker when increasing DMSO concentration,
with KB values equal to 104, 500, and 67 M–1 at 0, 50%, and 99% DMSO, respectively.
Similar observations were made by Tachibana et al.37 for the complexation of carbozole with β-CD when
the DMSO addition varies from 105 to 60% and by Eftink and Harrison38 for the complexation of p-nitrophenol
with α-CD with 10% to 50% of DMSO. In some cases, a high concentration
of DMSO can prevent a complexation from taking place, like for the
binding of puerarin with β-CD, which does not occur at 100%
DMSO.20 Finally, Bernad-Bernad et al.19 showed that the binding constant of albendazole
and mebendazole to α, β-, and γ-CD drastically decreases
when 25%, 50%, or 75% DMSO is added, but at 100% DMSO, if the binding
constant is smaller than that in water it is larger than that in a
mixture of water and DMSO. However, the behavior is different for
thianedazole: while additions of DMSO continuously increase the binding
constant for β-CD, it first increases it for α- and γ-CD
at 36% and 50% DMSO and then decreases it for 75% and 100%. Thianedazole
has also a much weaker affinity for cyclodextrins in water (Kb = 24, 38, and 100 M–1 for
α-, β-, and γ-CD, respectively) than the two other
drugs (Kb = 300–315, 1200–1500,
and 1000–900 M–1 for α-, β-,
and γ-CD, respectively). These results show that the addition
of DMSO cannot be systematically ascribed to a decrease in binding
constant and depends both on the type of cyclodextrin and on the ligand.
Most studies point out the importance of the size ratio between the
ligand and the cyclodextrin cavity. In our experiments, it is indeed
the only difference between the two AD/CD complexes. ADA’s
volume fits very well within the β-CD cavity, while the bigger
γ-CD cavity gives room for ADA to move. We expect a smaller
number of hydrogen bonds between the frustrated solvent molecules
inside the cavity as its size decreases, which strongly modifies the
entropy. This would induce a larger difference in solvent properties
between the molecules in the bulk and those in the solvation shell
for β-CD compared to γ-CD, which is consistent with sound
velocity measurements (as given by [U](∞)).
The difference contributes to make the binding of ADA to β-CD
in water much stronger than that to γ-CD. However, it is still
difficult to assess the exact contribution of DMSO. To gain further
insight on this question, future work should focus on the decomposition
of the free energy into its enthalpic and entropic contributions.

Conclusion
The above results suggest that the effect of DMSO is stronger for
hydrophobic ligands whose volume better fits the cavity of a hydrophobic
binding site. For these complexes, the ligand affinity determined
in the presence of DMSO may not reflect its affinity in the absence
of DMSO, such as in vivo conditions. Ideally, binding properties should
be determined in the absence of any cosolvent, which is likely impossible
using experimental techniques for poorly water-soluble ligands. However,
our free energy calculations using computer simulations could reproduce
accurately the experimental variations of binding free energies. This
suggests that such a numerical approach represents a valuable alternative
to experimental techniques to determine binding constants without
the need of a cosolvent.

Methods
Materials
β-Cylcodextrin
(purity >97%), γ-cylcodextrin
(purity >98%), 1-adamantane carboxylic acid (purity >99%), and
dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) (purity of >99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The solubilities of β-cylcodextrin and γ-cylcodextrin
in water at 25 °C are 18.5 and 232 g/L, respectively,39 while the solubility of 1-adamantane carboxylic
acid in buffer was about 0.75 g/L. We evaluated the latter by sound
velocity measurements as the value of sound velocity is very sensitive
to both aggregation and solute concentration.40 All samples were prepared with solute concentrations below their
solubility values. Water was purified using a PURELAB Option-Q unit
(ELGA LabWater). D2O and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO-d6) were purchased from Euriso-Top
(Saint-Aubin, France).

Sample Preparation
We prepared two
kinds of pH 7.5
buffers. The first one is a 50 mM phosphate buffer, prepared by dissolving
the appropriate amounts of sodium phosphate dibasic and sodium phosphate
monobasic in a required volume of water (H2O). Then the
pH was adjusted to 7.5 when necessary. The second one followed the
same preparation except for the addition of 5% (v/v) DMSO during the
buffer preparation. For sound velocity measurements, H2O was used, whereas for NMR D2O was used along with deuterated
DMSO.

Ultrasound Velocity
Sound velocities of solutions were
measured at 25 °C using a previously described differential resonator
method,41−44 at a frequency of 7.5 MHz with a precision of 0.15 cm/s in buffers.
A solution of 1-adamantane carboxylic acid (0.76 mL) filled a first
thermostatted cell (with an initial concentration of 0.5–0.7
g/L depending on the sample), while the second cell contained the
same volume of solvent (either a 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.5
or the same buffer with the addition of 5% (v/v) of DMSO). In each
cell, two lithium niobate piezotransducers face each other. The analysis
of the frequency–amplitude characteristic of the resonator
was performed with an Agilent (model E5100A) network/spectrum analyzer.
Titration was performed in both cells by adding an identical volume
of a solution of cyclodextrin solubilized in the same buffer as for
ADA. For each titration, we derived the sound velocity increment [U] = (U – Uo)(Uo[ADA]), where U and Uo are the sound velocities in the
solution and in its solvent, respectively, and [ADA] is the molar
concentration of 1-adamantane carboxylic acid. The variation in [U] values is eventually plotted as a function of the molar
ratio, r = [CD]/[ADA], of cyclodextrin to 1-adamantane
carboxylic acid and can be fitted by the following equation [U](r) = [U](r = 0) + α(r)[U](r = ∞), where α(r) is the fraction of
bound 1-adamantane carboxylic acid. Taking Y = 2Kb[ADA], it can be easily demonstrated that α(r) is a solution of the equation: 3  It should be stressed
that the above technique
probes all the sample volume (i.e., all solvent molecules also contribute
to sound velocity). Any discrepancy between the concentration of titrant
or of solvent between the titrated solution (i.e., solute solubilized
in the solvent) and the titrated solvent would lead to a wrong estimation
of sound velocity increment. Thus, extra care should be exerted when
using DMSO due to absortion/desorption phenomena on cell and transducer
surfaces. In particularly, cells should always be washed with a 5%
DMSO buffer and be soaked for hours with it before starting measurements.

NMR
All solutions were freshly prepared either in D2O or in D2O with 5% DMSO-d6 and buffered with 10 mM phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5.
Two stocks solutions were prepared, the first one with 0.1 mM of either
β- or γ-CD and the second one containing 0.1 mM of either
β- or γ-CD supplemented with 0.1 mM of adamantane. A volume v1 of the first stock solution, that is, without
ADA, was added to and mixed with a volume v2 of the second stock solution, that is, with ADA, so that the total
volume was always 500 μL. By varying v1 and v2, we prepared solutions
with a resulting [CD]/[ADA] ratio ranging from 0.4 to 4, while the
concentration of β or γ-CD was kept constant. Each experiment
was repeated three times. 1D 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on an Avance II Bruker AC-400 MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer. Each spectrum
was acquired with 128 scans, and the temperature was maintained at
25 ± 0.1 °C. Spectral acquisition and processing and chemical
shift determination were performed using TopSpin 2.1 software. Chemical
shifts are given in ppm (δ) and calibrated to the residual solvent
HDO peak at 4.79 ppm. The complexation-induced chemical shift difference
is given as the difference between the chemical shift of the free
cyclodextrin molecule and the chemical shift of the bound CD molecule:
Δδ = δfree – δcomplex.

Data Fitting
For velocity and NMR experiments, the
data were fitted using the least-squares method accessible from the
scipy module of python (www.scipy.org). For several series of titration corresponding to the same type
of experiment (i.e., same solvent, same cyclodextrin, and NMR based
on same proton), all the points were fitted once using an identical
unknown binding constant, Kb, while other
unknown parameters, [U](∞) for sound velocity
and Δδmax for NMR, were different depending
on the series. Indeed, a global fitting allows us to achieve better
accuracy on the Kb value.45 The error associated with each parameter was obtained from
the autocorrelation matrix.

Free Energy Calculations
All molecular
dynamics (MD)
simulations were performed with GROMACS 5.0.7.46 The GROMOS 53A6GLYC force field36 was used for β- and γ-CD, the GROMOS 54A747 force field for ADA, along with the SPC model
for water.48 For all MD simulations involved
in free energy calculations, we used the Langevin integrator with
a 2 fs time step, a friction coefficient of 0.1 ps–1 and a temperature of 298 K. All bonds were constrained with the
P-LINCS algorithm,49 and the full rigidity
of the water molecules was enforced by the SETTLE algorithm.50 For NPT simulations, pressure was maintained
at 1 bar using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat51 with a relaxation time of 4 ps and an isothermal compressibility
of 4.5 × 10–5 bar–1. Lennard-Jones
interactions were computed using a twin-range scheme set to 8 and
14 Å, and the neighbor list was updated every 10 steps. Electrostatic
interactions were computed using the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method52,53 with a real-space cutoff distance of 14 Å, a grid spacing of
1.2 Å, and an interpolation scheme of order 4. The structures
of β-CD, γ-CD, and ADA were obtained from CSD Cambridge
Structural Database (CDDC 648855),54 Protein
Data Bank (PDB 1D3C),55 and PubChem (CID 13235) respectively.
To construct the complex CD–ADA, we first performed some self-assembly
MD simulations in the NPT ensemble using the leapfrog integrator.
The ligand spontaneously bound to the CD within a few tens of nanoseconds.
For all simulations involving the complex or the ADA ligand in water,
we added one sodium ion to neutralize the ADA carboxylic group. Neutrality
was maintained to fit our experimental conditions performed at pH
7.5. All the systems were obtained from self-assembly simulations
and then used for free energy calculations. The composition of each
system is described in Table 2. Four and three replicas were performed for a system containing
β- and γ-CD, respectively. To assess the affinity of ADA
for both types of CD we used a free energy perturbation method. ADA
was decoupled from CD or solvent via a linear alchemical pathway.
The distance between the centers of mass of CD and ADA was restrained56 by a harmonic potential with a force constant
of 1000 kJ mol–1 nm–2. Ten windows
were used for distance restraints, 5 for electrostatic decoupling,
and 15 for van der Waals interaction decoupling. Each window was simulated
for 50 ns. The last 40 ns were used for analysis. Results were analyzed
with the python package pymbar57 which
implements the multiple Bennett acceptance ratio.58 The evaluation of the binding free energy of a charged
species such as carboxylic ADA (net charge of −1) using explicit-solvent
simulations and lattice-sum methods induces some artifacts that need
to be corrected. We used the analytical scheme suggested by Rocklin
et al.59 for correcting the free energy
evaluated from our simulations: 4  where ΔGMD,PBC(L) is the raw value calculated
from our simulations using periodic boundary conditions, ΔΔGANA(L) is
a correction term for finite-size effects, ΔΔGDSC(L) is a correction
term for discrete solvent effects, and ΔGMD,NBC is the binding free energy corrected for
all these effects. Reported in SI is the
description of how ΔΔGANA(L) and ΔΔGDSC(L) were calculated.
All reported values in this manuscript and in Table 1 are the corrected free energies ΔGMD,NBC.
