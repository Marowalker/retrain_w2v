The interaction mechanism between
a scarcely soluble copper(II)
complex of Cu(II)-6-hydroxychromone-3-carbaldehyde-(3′-hydroxy)benzoylhydrazone
(CuCHz) in aqueous solution and its DMβCD complex was studied in the
presence of ctDNA through spectroscopy and thermodynamic
methods. The thermodynamic results indicate that the binding process
of the CuCHz–DMβCD inclusion complex is
a spontaneous process and the inclusion is enthalpy-driven. The binding
constants of CuCHz and CuCHz–DMβCD
with ctDNA are 2.69 × 103 and 14.7
× 103 L mol–1, respectively. The
stoichiometry of the complex is 1:1, and the determined thermodynamic
indicates that the process of binding is spontaneous and entropy-driven.
A competitive binding titration with ethidium bromide revealed that CuCHz efficiently displaces EB from the EB–DNA system.
In addition to the thermal denaturation experiments and docking studies,
we can confirm that the mode of binding of this complex to ctDNA is intercalation mode. The presence of DMβCD
enhances the aqueous solubility of CuCHz; nevertheless,
the cyclodextrin did not affect the interaction of CuCHz with ctDNA because the inclusion complex breaks
down when it binds with ctDNA.

Introduction
Design of small molecules
that bind and react at specific sequences
of deoxyribonucleic acid ctDNA is very important
in the development of new therapeutic reagents. ctDNA is generally the primary intracellular target of anticancer drugs,
so the interaction between small molecules and ctDNA can often cause ctDNA damage in cancer cells,
blocking their division with concomitant cell death.1

Chromone(1-benzopyran-4-one) moiety as a ligand scaffold
represents
a class of naturally occurring molecules.2 They have attracted attention in recent years because of their diverse
pharmacological properties such as antimycobacterial, antifungal,
anticancer, antioxidant, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects.3,4 Transition-metal complexes obtained from 3-formylchromone Schiff
bases have still received considerable attention, in view of their
chelating ability exhibiting efficient ctDNA binding.5−10 This type of compounds bearing N and O donors has structural similarities
to neutral biological systems in which the C=N linkage of azomethine
derivatives is essential for their displayed biological activity.
Also, it has been demonstrated that this chelating activity is enhanced
on chelation with metal atoms due to the increase in the planarity
of the intercalators, allowing the insertion of the complexes and
their stacking between the base pairs of double-helical ctDNA more easier than the free ligands.7,10 A number of
metal complexes (Cu(II), Zn(II), Pd(II), Pt(II), Ni(II), La(III),
Ru(II), Sm(III), and Nd(III)) with Schiff base derivative have been
reported, and their ctDNA-binding properties have
been studied.5−13 Nevertheless, these metal complexes have a disadvantage due to their
water solubility, which is still unsatisfactory, restricting their
use as anticancer agents.14,15

Drug carrier
vehicles play an important role in the active transport
of drugs in both increasing concentration and effectiveness of drugs
at the required site. In this context, cyclodextrins (CDs) play a
pivotal role in supramolecular delivery applications due to their
nature as macrocyclic hosts, as reported in many drug formulations.16 CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides with a cagelike
structure formed by α-1,4-linked d-glucopyranose units.
CDs have the shape of a truncated cone with internal cavities ranging
from 5 to 8 Å. The C–H bonds (H-3′, H-5′)
on the ring point inward, producing a hydrophobic cavity. In this
conformation, electron lone pairs belonging to glycosidic oxygens
remain toward the interior of the CD cavity, thus increasing the electron
density along with the Lewis base character of the latter.17 Cyclodextrins and modified cyclodextrins form
inclusion complexes capable of binding substrates that quickly, selectively,
and reversibly act as catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions.18 It is very well known that hydrophobic molecules
and/or some hydrophobic moieties display an increased affinity for
CD’s cavity in the aqueous solution. In fact, the capability
of cyclodextrins to improve and enhance not only the solubility but
also the stability of several drugs is known to be mediated through
the formation of inclusion complexes.19 The stability of these inclusion complexes is determined by the
fit of the entire or at least the hydrophobic part of the guest molecule.
On the other hand, modified cyclodextrin derivatives like methylation
of the hydroxyl groups have attracted interest because they have greater
water solubility. In this sense, dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin has
been used to include diverse drugs like paclitaxel,20,21 hydroxymethylnitrofurazone,22 luteolin,23 4-hydroxycoumarin,24 catechin,25 (−)-epigallocatechin
galate,26 and morin,27 improving their complexing ability and stabilization of
the incorporated drug. Even though cyclodextrins are recognized by
the ability to form such complexes as reported elsewhere (vide supra),
reports on drugs that bind to ctDNA and solubilized
by cyclodextrin are scanty.28−35 Also, cyclodextrins are recognized to increase the solubility of
complexes and/or to modulate the binding of small molecules to ctDNA by selectively blocking/orienting the drug upon its
binding.

Copper(II) complexes have attracted considerable attention
owing
to their high affinity for nucleobases and their capability of interacting
directly with ctDNA that leads to cell cycle arrest
and in turn to cell death.36 Therefore,
this study contributes to improving the aqueous solubility of the
copper(II)-6-hydroxychromone-3-carbaldehyde-(3′-hydroxy)benzoylhydrazone
(CuCHz) complex through inclusion in DMβCD and
also leads to a better understanding of the effect of cyclodextrins
on the properties and functionality of drug–ctDNA complexes. Different methods were employed to investigate the ctDNA-binding ability of CuCHz. This included
fluorescence titration at different temperatures to determine thermodynamic
parameters, fluorescence displacement assays, and thermal denaturation
and molecular docking studies.

Results and Discussion
One-Pot Synthesis of Copper(II)
Complex (CuCHz)
The
mixture of copper(II) chloride dihydrate (4 mmol), 6-hydroxy-chromone-3-carboxaldehyde
(2 mmol), and 3-hydroxybenzoylhydrazine (2 mmol) in ethanol was stirred
and heated under reflux for 2 h (Scheme 1). The resulting green precipitate, copper(II)
complex, was collected by filtration, washed several times with ethanol,
and dried overnight at 80 °C. Yield, 82%; mp, 277 °C (decomp.).

Scheme 1 One-Pot Synthesis of the Copper(II) Complex of 6-Hydroxychromone-3-carbaldehyde-3-hydroxybenzoylhydrazine
(CuCHz)
The copper(II) complex
is easily soluble in DMF and DMSO; slightly
soluble in ethanol, methanol, water, and acetone; and insoluble in
benzene and diethyl ether. The UV spectra had a strong band at λmax = 260 nm, a medium band at λmax = 372
nm, and a weak band at λmax = 432 nm. Fluorescence
spectra have a maximum at 440 nm with an excitation wavelength of
335 nm with bandwidths for excitation and emission of 5 and 12 nm,
respectively. Even though the complex was formed by one-pot synthesis,
characterization of CHz (6-hydroxychromone-3-carbaldehyde-(3′-hydroxy)-benzoylhydrazone)
and the NMR titration curve with Cu(II) was recorded to confirm the
complex formation (Figures S4–S9).

The stability of CuCHz in the aqueous solution
has
been studied by observing the UV–vis spectrum and remained
unaltered for 24 h. The molar conductivity of the Cu(II) complex is
88.3 S cm2 mol–1 in DMSO, showing that
it is 1:1 electrolyte, indicating that the chloride anion is out of
the coordination sphere as a counter ion.37 The thermogram show no weight loss up to 250 °C for CHz and 200 °C for CuCHz, confirming the stability
of the copper(II) complex as well as the absence of any water molecule
in/out of the coordination sphere (Figure S3). The magnetic moment of the complex CuCHz is 1.70
BM, giving an indication of a one-electron paramagnetic d9–Cu(II) center that suggests a square planar complex.38 The characterization of the obtained complex
indicates that the structure is [Cu(CHz)Cl]Cl.

The IR spectra
of Cu(II)-6-hydroxychromone-3-carbaldehyde-(3′-hydroxy)benzoylhydrazone
(CuCHz) show a broad band at around 3000 cm–1 due to the presence of OH and NH moieties. Also, a strong band at
1569 cm–1 is observed due to the stretching vibration
of the ν(C=N) group. This signal was shifted to a lower
frequency compared to ν(C=N) of CHz, which
indicates the coordination of azomethine nitrogen to the metal ion.
This shift may be the result of a transfer of the electron density
from the donor atom (N) toward the metal center, leading to weakening
of the ν(C=N) absorption band. As well, two characteristic
carbonyl stretching frequencies are observed at 1638 and 1605 cm–1 that are assigned to ν(C=O)chromone and ν(C=O)hydrazone, moieties, respectively.
The latter signals are shifted to a lower wavenumber compared to the
vibration of CHz, indicating that both carbonyl oxygen
and azomethine nitrogen atoms could participate as an ONO-tridentate
ligand39,40 in the presence of copper. Besides different
tautomeric forms that can exist for CHz, there is only
one structural copper complex that takes place and is definitively
that poses two carbonyl groups.

When increased concentrations
of DMβCD are added to the reaction
medium containing CuCHz, the recorded absorption spectra
show only minor changes; however, the effect of DMβCD on the
fluorescence spectra is more pronounced. At pH 7.4, the emission maximum
is at 440 nm and the addition of increasing concentrations of DMβCD
from 0 to 2.65 mmol L–1 resulted in a corresponding
increase in the fluorescence signal with a slight displacement to
lower wavenumber (Figure 1). One of the results of formation inclusion complexes, in
our case CuCHz and DMβCD, is the increase in the
observed fluorescence intensity, which could be due to the change
in the microenvironment of CuCHz as it entered in the
cavity of DMβCD. To determine the stoichiometry of this complex,
we analyzed the intensity changes in the emission spectra according
to the Benesi–Hildebrand plot,41 results that confirmed a 1:1 stoichiometry corroborated by a straight
line by the continuous variation method (Figure S11).

Figure 1 Fluorescence intensity of CuCHz (1 ×
10–5 mol L–1) in the presence
of various concentrations
of DMβCD (0.2–2.6 × 10–3 mol L–1) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Inset: Double reciprocal
plot 1/ΔF versus 1/[DMβCD] obtained from
the fluorescence intensities recorded for the CuCHz–DMβCD
complexes. λexc, 335 nm; λem, 440
nm. Excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 5 and 12 nm, respectively.

The association constants, Ka, of the
inclusion complexes between the Cu(II) complex (CuCHz) and cyclodextrin at different temperatures (298, 308, and 318 K)
were calculated from the double reciprocal plot, and the results are
summarized in Table 1. From Table 1, it
is possible to notice that the determined association constant for
the CuCHz–DMβCD complex decreases when the
temperature increases, in total agreement with an exothermic process.
This could be thought of as a decreasing degree of interaction occurring
at higher temperatures due to the weakening of hydrogen bonds in the
heating process.

Table 1 Association Constant (Ka) of the CuCHz–DMβCD Complex at Different
Temperatures and Thermodynamic Parameters
T (K)	Ka (L mol–1)	ΔG (kJ mol–1)	ΔH (kJ mol–1)	ΔS (kJ mol–1 K–1)	
298	240 ± 11	–13.60	–11.58	6.60 × 10–3	
308	199 ± 37

The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS) for the formation of inclusion
complexes were determined from the temperature dependence of the apparent
formation constants using the classical van’t Hoff equation
and plotting ln K versus 1/T 1  where K is the associative
binding constant corresponding to various temperatures and R is the gas constant (8.314 J K–1 mol–1). The standard-state enthalpy change (ΔH°) can be calculated from the slope of the van’t
Hoff relationship, the standard-state entropy change (ΔS°) can be calculated from the intercept, and the standard-state
Gibbs energy change (ΔG°) can be estimated
from the following relationship 2  In CD complex formation, several driving forces
must be considered, namely, hydrogen bonding formation among hydroxyl
groups of CDs and the guest molecules. Also, van der Waals interactions
play an important role in host–guest molecules. Hydrophobic
and the expulsion of “high energy waters” from the interior
of cyclodextrin toward bulk water must be considered. The result of
the changes can be noticed in large negative enthalpy and in entropy
values (either negative or slightly positive), which can be attributed
to strong van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bond formation at
the interior of the hydrophobic cavity, leading to guest inclusion
without extensive desolvation.42 According
to the values of ΔH° and ΔS° given in Table 1, the inclusion process of CuCHz with
DMβCD might correspond to an enthalpy-driven process. The negative
value of the standard Gibbs energy change (ΔG), which is the result of the interplay of enthalpy and entropy changes,
indicates in our case that the formation of the inclusion complex
is a spontaneous process.

The electronic structure of the Cu(II)
complex was obtained by
means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The molecular
geometry was fully optimized using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP level.
Nonmetal atoms were described with B3LYP/6-31G(d), and Cu(II) atom
was treated by B3LYP/LANL2DZ basis sets. The optimized structure is
shown in Figure 2a.
With this conformation at hand, we used a previously optimized DMβCD28 to carried out molecular docking studies using
the AutoDock 4.2 version program to determine the most stable structure
of the Cu(II) complex. Then, the most stable conformation for the
Cu(II) complex was chosen according to the best docking score. According
to this result, only one orientation of the guest complex and the
host molecule (DMβCD) was found where the chromone moiety of CuCHz remains toward the primary ring and the benzoyl ring
toward the secondary rim. In this attained conformation, it is possible
to observe three hydrogen bonds namely, a hydrogen bond between the
OH group of benzoyl and 2-OCH3 in the secondary face at
2.2 Å. Another hydrogen bond remains with the anomeric oxygen
of the chromone moiety at 1.9 Å toward the primary face of DMβCD.
The N–H group in that conformation forms a hydrogen bond with
the opposite anomeric oxygen at 1.8 Å. In that actual conformation,
the complex remains completely embedded in the CD hydrophobic cavity
(Figure 2b).

complex, as calculated by docking studies.

Interaction studies of metal complexes with ctDNA
are significant for designing new drugs. Spectral changes in
absorbance or fluorescence are important to find out the possible
mechanism of binding of the compound with ctDNA.
The absorption spectrum of CuCHz forming an inclusion
complex with DMβCD presents two bands corresponding to 268 and
423 nm. In the presence of an increasing concentration of ctDNA, a marked decrease in the absorbance at 423 nm (approximately
33.16%) and a progressive blue shift of 8 nm (Figure S12) are observed, indicative of an interaction between CuCHz–DMβCD and ctDNA, which
could be due to a stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore
and the base pair of ctDNA.35,43

We used fluorescence spectroscopy to analyze the interactions
occurring
between CuCHz with ctDNA, considering the presence
(or the absence) of DMβCD at fixed concentrations of CuCHz and
increased concentrations of ctDNA (Figures S13 and S14). In the case of fluorescence, a significant
increase in the fluorescence emission is normally observed for intercalation
modes of interaction.44 The degree of freedom
of guest molecules, especially rotations, favors the deactivation
of excited states. However, when molecule CuCHz, that is used in this
study, is bound to ctDNA, it becomes rigid, favoring
the emission fluorescence with an observed concomitant increase in
the emission. Other interactions, namely, electrostatic, hydrogen
bonding, or hydrophobic, known to occur in groove binding agents result
in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity in the presence of ctDNA mainly due to their closeness to the sugar–phosphate
backbone.45 The Cu(II) complex emits weak
fluorescence in Tris buffer with a maximum wavelength of about 440
nm. Upon addition of increasing concentrations of ctDNA, there is an enhancement in the emission intensity, indicative
of a certain type of interaction with ctDNA (Figure 3). In the presence
of cyclodextrin, the behavior is to some extent alike; there is still
an enhancement of fluorescence in the presence of ctDNA without a significant shift of the emission wavelength maximum
in the aqueous solution. This increase in the emission intensity agrees
well with that observed for other intercalators,46 suggesting that CuCHz interacts with ctDNA and is protected from solvent water molecules by the
hydrophobic environment inside the ctDNA helix. Nevertheless,
the cyclodextrin complex interacts with ctDNA more
efficiently, which could be due to the enhancement of the solubility
of the Cu(II) complex.

Figure 3 Relative changes in the fluorescence intensity (F/F0) of CuCHz (10
μM)
and CuCHz–DMβCD (10 μM) with the increased
addition of ctDNA (0–22.5 μM) in the
buffer solution.

To compare the binding
strength of both complexes with ctDNA, the binding
constant, Kb, and the number of binding
sites, n, from the fluorescence
spectral changes on titration with ctDNA were determined
using the following equation 3  where Kb is the
binding constant, n is the number of binding sites, F0 is the fluorescence intensity of the small
molecule in the absence of ctDNA, while F is the fluorescence intensity of the small molecule in the presence
of ctDNA, and [Q] is the concentration
of ctDNA. Kb and n are easily calculated from the double logarithm regression
curve of log(F0 – F)/F versus log[Q]. The values of Kb and n were estimated from
the intercept and slope of the plot of log ΔF/F versus log[Q], respectively.
The binding constant and the number of binding sites for the interaction
between CuCHz and ctDNA in the absence
and presence of cyclodextrin were determined (Table 2). The values of n are approximately
1.3 for both Cu(II) complex (with and without cyclodextrin); this
showed a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction of CuCHz and ctDNA, which indicates the existence of just a single binding
site in ctDNA for CuCHz. The binding
constant, Kb, of CuCHz with ctDNA at 298 K was 2.69 × 103 L mol–1 (correlation coefficient, 0.990), and in the presence
of cyclodextrin, the Kb value increases
to 14.7 × 103 L mol–1 (correlation
coefficient, 0.986). It has been reported that cyclodextrin does not
cause any DNA cleavage;47 therefore, DMβCD
besides enhancing the solubility of CuCHz selectively
orients the drug molecule upon its binding to ctDNA.28 From these results, we confirm that cyclodextrin
is a good delivery nanovehicle for the supply of a drug to target ctDNA.

Complex with ctDNA at Different Temperatures and
Thermodynamic Parameters of CuCHz–DMβCD
with ctDNA
 	T (K)	log Kb	Ka (L mol–1)	n	R	ΔG (kJ mol–1)	ΔH (kJ mol–1)	ΔS (kJ mol–1 K–1)	
CuCHz	298	3.43	2690	1.29	0.990	 	 	 	
CuCHz–DMβCD	298	4.17	14 791	1.33	0.986	–24.76	3.58	9.20 × 10–2	
CuCHz–DMβCD	308	4.19	15 488	1.36	0.991	
CuCHz–DMβCD	318	4.21	16 218	1.35	0.985	
As depicted
in Table 2, the Kb values of CuCHz on ctDNA in the presence of cyclodextrin increase
in the range of temperature from 298 to 318 K. This demonstrated that CuCHz has a good affinity for ctDNA and the
stability of the association of CuCHz with ctDNA growth upon an increase in temperature.

The analysis of
thermodynamic parameters including ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS is one of the effective
methods for judging the mode of association
of small molecules with biomolecules. As stated before, several interactions
can be identified when it comes to describing the binding of drugs
to a pharmaceutical target such as DNA, namely, hydrogen bonds, van
der Waals forces, and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions.
Enthalpy and entropy changes can be determined when the dependence
of Kb with temperature is analyzed by
means of the van’t Hoff equation (eq 1). Our results are given in Table 2. The sign and magnitude of
several thermodynamic parameters associated with individual interactions
occurring in the association process of drugs and macromolecules have
been given elsewhere.48,49 Using this description, we observed
what kinds of interactions were the predominant ones. When ΔH < 0 or ΔH = 0 and ΔS > 0, the mainly acting force is electrostatic; when
ΔH < 0, ΔS < 0,
van der Waals
interactions or hydrogen bonds dominate the reaction, and when ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, the main force
is
hydrophobic. Thermodynamic parameters obtained are listed in Table 2, where the positive
small values 3.58 kJ mol–1 for ΔH and 0.092 kJ mol–1 for ΔS between CuCHz–DMβCD and ctDNA indicated that the binding is mainly entropy-driven. This means
that the hydrophobic forces play a major role in the binding; nevertheless,
due to the low value of the enthalpy change, the other noncovalent
interactions cannot be excluded.50,51 In general,
the complex of major/minor groove binding is stabilized by electrostatic,
hydrogen bonding, and/or hydrophobic interactions;52 however, the complex of intercalation, where a planar aromatic
chromophore is inserted between two adjacent base pairs in a ctDNA helix, is a process that starts with the transfer
of the intercalating molecule from a hydrophobic cavity (cyclodextrin)
to the hydrophobic space between two adjacent ctDNA
base pairs and is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and van der
Waals forces.47 This suggests that entropy
and enthalpy processes drive the interaction of CuCHz–DMβCD with ctDNA and this binding
can be assigned to the intercalation mode.

To test whether the
copper complex binds to ctDNA via intercalation,
ethidium bromide was employed. To check whether
the metal complexes have the ability to achieve complexation with ctDNA, competitive binding experiments are a valid method.53 EB was selected as a fluorescence probe because
of its known spectral properties, and it is widely used as a fluorescence
chromophore marker for ctDNA. The fluorescence intensity
of the EB–ctDNA system is much better than
that of free EB due to the strong intercalation between the adjacent ctDNA base pairs. If the Cu(II) complex has the same binding
mode with ctDNA as that of EB, the fluorescence-based
competition technique can provide indirect evidence for the ctDNA-binding mode. This means that the fluorescence of
the EB–ctDNA system can be quenched by the
addition of a second species that is able to displace the EB molecules.

Competitive binding studies using ethidium bromide bound to ctDNA were carried out. Figure 4 shows the variation of emission spectra
of ctDNA pretreated with EB ([DNA]/[EB] = 1:1) with
increasing concentration of the Cu(II) complex in the absence and
presence of DMβCD. A fluorescence decrease of EB–ctDNA was observed at the maximum of 593 nm as the concentration
of the copper(II) complex increases in the absence and presence of
cyclodextrin. The results revealed the quenching of the initial fluorescence
intensity about 10 and 18% for CuCHz with and without
DMβCD, respectively, and in both situations, the displacement
of EB occurs, which indicates that CuCHz in both forms
could displace EB from the EB–ctDNA system.

10–5 mol L–1). Inset: fluorescence
quenching curves of EB–ctDNA.

To further exclude the possible presence of other processes,
thermal
denaturation properties are investigated. The effect of denatured ctDNA was studied by heating a native ctDNA solution in a water bath at 100 °C for 10 min and then cooling
in an ice–water bath immediately, accordingly to Wang et al.54 Double-stranded ctDNA splits
into two single-stranded ctDNA molecules with the
opening of its double helix, so the interaction of CuCHz and CuCHz–DMβCD with denatured ctDNA will be different in comparison to that with double-stranded ctDNA. If the interaction is via intercalation, ctDNA accommodates the copper(II) complex in the helix,
and on denaturation of the ctDNA helix, the intercalated
molecules are released in the solution, leading an alteration in the
fluorescence behavior. Table 3 displays the intensity fluorescence ratios (F/F0) for CuCHz and CuCHz–DMβCD when is in the presence of different
amounts of native and denatured ctDNA. From the table,
it can be noticed a diminution of the fluorescence in denaturated ctDNA, which in turn supports CuCHz and CuCHz–DMβCD ctDNA intercalation.

The
melting temperature (Tm) of the ctDNA solution, which is defined as the temperature where
half of the total base pairs are unbound, is usually measured to study
the interaction of an intercalator with the nucleic acid. Small molecules
have an impact on the stabilization of the ctDNA
double helix, which can be corroborated with an increase in the ctDNA melting temperature, probably due to increased stability
of base stacking in the presence of an intercalator.44 This temperature (Tm) is obtained
from the midpoint of ctDNA melting curves, generally
increasing ca. 5–8 °C for medium-sized molecules when
they bind to ctDNA by intercalation. There is no
noticeable change in temperature for nonintercalation binding. In
our study, the absence of Cu(II) complexes revealed a Tm of 67.9 °C; however, when Cu(II) complexes were
present, the Tm of ctDNA increased to 77.0 and 73.5 °C in the presence or absence
of DMβCD, respectively (Figure 5). The ΔTm values
of 9.1 and 5.6 indicate that melting temperatures correspond to those
for classical intercalators.55 We can infer
that the copper(II) complex in the presence of DMβCD binds or
intercalates between base pairs of double-helical ctDNA more efficiently, as compared to the Cu(II) complex alone.

of CuCHz (red hexagon) and in the presence of CuCHz–DMβCD (blue triangle up solid). At pH 7.4, [CuCHz] = 25 μM and [DNA] = 50 μM.

Computational docking simulation studies of the copper(II) complex
with DNA were carried out to predict the chosen binding site inside
the DNA. The docked conformation of the compound with the lowest free
energy and pose is shown in Figure 6. When CuCHz is docked into ctDNA, the planar ligand remains intercalated between the base pairs
of DNA, forming π–π interactions with the adjacent
nucleotide moieties. As stated, intercalator compounds must display
interactions of the π–π type to achieve the expected
binding mode. In our case, when the CHz molecule is complexed
with Cu(II), it attains a planar conformation around Cu(II), which
renders this molecule with the ability of such stacking interactions.
Thus, according to our docking results, the chromone moiety of CuCHz remains intercalated to a pair of nucleobases at 3.4
Å at one side of DNA (see Figure 6). It is worth mentioning that this pose is cooperatively
stabilized by several hydrogen bonds to the DNA structure. The hydroxyl
group of the chromone remains to form a hydrogen bond at 1.8 Å
with the G base; on the other hand, the hydroxyl group of phenol remains
in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the phosphoryl hydrogen. Taking
these interactions into account jointly with the strength of hydrogen
bonds between G and C bases reinforced the favorable intercalated
pose between CuCHz and DNA.

Conclusions
The binding constant and the number of binding
sites for the interaction
between CuCHz and ctDNA in the absence
and the presence of cyclodextrin were determined. In both cases, a
single binding site in ctDNA for CuCHz was observed. The binding constant in the presence of cyclodextrin
was higher, indicating that DMβCD selectively orients the drug
molecule upon its binding to ctDNA. On the other
hand, the thermodynamic results suggested that the process that drives
the interaction of CuCHz–DMβCD with ctDNA could be assigned to intercalation mode. We examined
the interaction of CuCHz to ctDNA and
found enough pieces of evidence for its binding mode. The interaction
occurrence is supported by the following findings: (i) the fluorescence
studies showed an appreciable increase in the CuCHz emission
upon the addition of ctDNA. (ii) A competitive reaction
monitored among the EB dye, ctDNA, and CuCHz showed that the intercalated EB was displaced from the ctDNA–EB system by CuCHz. (iii) An increase in
the melting temperature, Tm, caused by
the stabilization of base stacking indicates the intercalation in
the base pairs of ctDNA due to the presence of the
copper(II) complex and (iv) the docking results of the copper(II)
complex with ctDNA. The results presented here show
also that, CuCHz displayed a high affinity for ctDNA. Furthermore, the existence of DMβCD did not
affect the interaction of CuCHz with ctDNA and the inclusion complex decomposed when it binds to ctDNA.

Materials and Methods
Heptakis-2,6-O-dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin (DMβCD),
copper(II) chloride dihydrate, 6-hydroxy-chromone-3-carboxaldehyde,
3-hydroxybenzoylhydrazine, ethidium bromide (EB), and deoxyribonucleic
acid sodium salt from calf thymus (ctDNA) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. ctDNA was used as received without
further purification. The purity of ctDNA was determined
from optical measurements (A260/A280 > 1.8, where A represents
absorbance). Its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically
using the molar coefficient value, ε = 6600 L mol–1 cm–1. The stock solution of ctDNA was prepared in 5 mmol L–1 Tris–HCl/10
mmol L–1 NaCl buffer solution at pH 7.4 and stored
in a refrigerator at 4 °C until use. The aqueous solutions used
in the experiments were prepared daily from the stock solutions by
appropriate dilution in the buffer solution. All solvents employed
in the spectrophotometric analyses were of spectroscopic reagent grade.
Deionized water from a Milli-Q system apparatus (Millipore Corp.,
Billerica, MA) was used throughout the experiments.

The infrared
spectra were recorded by an FTIR spectrometer (Thermo
iS50) equipped with a germanium attenuated total reflection (ATR)
accessory, in the range of 4000–600 cm–1,
having an average of 20 spectra per analysis. The absorption spectrum
was recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer, which
is equipped with a Peltier system ±0.1 °C. Fluorescence
measurements were performed on an LS55 PerkinElmer spectrofluorometer
equipped with a xenon lamp source and by a Peltier temperature programmer
(PerkinElmer PTP-1 Peltier system). For all experiments, 1 cm length
cells were used. Mass spectra of the copper complex were recorded
by a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Exactive Plus Orbitrap, ThermoFisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Thermogravimetric analyses were carried
out from room temperature up to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10
°C min–1 on a TA Instruments TGA Q50. The molar
conductivities of the complexes in DMSO solutions (10–3 M) were measured at room temperature using a WTW microprocessor
conductivity meter LF 539. Magnetic moment measurements of the complex
were carried out on a Johnson Matthey magnetic susceptibility balance
using Hg[Co(SCN)4] as a calibrant.

Inclusion complexes
with DMβCD were obtained as described
earlier.56 For the determination of association
constants (Ka), the concentration of CuCHz was 1 × 10–5 mol L–1 and increased buffered solution of DMβCD was added. The resulting
mixture was equilibrated in a Precision thermostatic shaking water
bath at a determined temperature for 24 h after which the equilibrium
was reached and the emission intensity was recorded.

The interaction
between ctDNA and CuCHz was carried
out as follows: fixed amounts of CuCHz (1
× 10–5 mol L–1) in the absence
and presence of DMβCD (1 × 10–3 mol L–1) were titrated with increasing amounts of the ctDNA solution in the Tris–HCl/NaCl buffer solution.
While measuring the absorption spectra, an equal amount of ctDNA was added to both the complex solution and the reference
solution to eliminate the absorbance of ctDNA itself.
In the ctDNA melting experiments, the absorbance
of ctDNA (5 × 10–5 mol L–1) at 260 nm was monitored by gradually increasing
the temperature from 40 to 95 °C in the presence and absence
of CuCHz and CuCHz–DMβCD (5
× 10–5 mol L–1). The absorbance
values of ctDNA and CuCHz were normalized
and plotted as a function of temperature.

The intercalating
effect of the copper(II) complex with the ctDNA–EB
was studied by the gradual addition of the
complex solution into the solution of ctDNA–EB.
The ctDNA–EB complex was prepared by adding
0.33 μ mol L–1 EB and 15 μ mol L–1ctDNA in the Tris–HCl/NaCl
buffer solution, pH 7.4. This solution was titrated by the successive
addition of 5 × 10–6 mol L–1 stock solution of the copper(II) complex with and without cyclodextrin.
The fluorescence spectra of EB bound to ctDNA have
a maximum at 593 nm with an excitation wavelength of 500 nm with bandwidths
for excitation and emission of 8 and 15 nm, respectively. The emission
spectra were recorded in the 530–700 nm range.

Docking
studies were carried out using AutoDock57 (version 4.2) software. Thus, from the RCSB protein data
bank, the pdb file for DNA (PDB ID: 1Z3F) was obtained. We used this crystal structure
for CuCHz–DNA docking studies. Grid maps were
calculated using AutoGrid4 centered on DMβCD defining a volume
of 30 Å3 with a 0.375 Å grid spacing. The AutoTors
option of AutoDockTools was used to define rotatable bonds. The genetic
Lamarckian algorithm was used under the following conditions: population
size, 50; maximum number of evaluations, 25 000 000;
maximum number of generations, 27 000; rate of mutation, 0.02;
and rate of crossover, 0.08. The evaluations were performed with a
default dielectric. The most stable pose of CuCHz was
chosen according to the best docking score.
