The rice plant produces an amorphous
silica layer in the husk covering
the brown rice grain as a part of a protective respiration system.
The layer shows high permeation molecular flow while the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
isotherm indicates the existence of nanometer-sized pores. Here, we
interpret the inner structure of the layer as a porous network consisting
of void spheres with a degree of 2–5 and tunnels with a length
of 2–7 nm based on the transmission electron microscopy images.
In the network, the gas molecules travel through the tunnels and move
in random directions after collisions with the walls of the spheres.
A tree network was introduced to understand the permeance of the layer
and the reflection of the molecule of the root or parent sphere was
estimated for a specific case. The tree becomes a graph with cycles
in a finite space such as the silica layer and the reflection of the
root sphere in the graph converses to that of the tree. On the basis
of the properties of the network, the high permeance of the silica
layer in the rice husk can be explained. It is suggested that the
specific system restricts the movements of the gas molecules and can
be applied to reduce the size of gas phase separation and chemical
reactor systems providing a new view to understand nanoscaled porous
materials.

1 Introduction
Rice
is the principal staple in Asia and over 400 million tons
are produced annually throughout the world. At maturity, the rice
plant has root, the main stem, and a number of tillers. Each productive
tiller bears a terminal flowering head that has ∼80 rice grains.
The rice grain consists of the brown rice and the hull or husk which
encloses the brown rice. The husk weighs about 20% of the total grain
and its thickness varies from 50 to 100 μm.1,2 The
husk is divided into three layers—an outer 50 nm cellulose
layer, a 2–5 μm silica layer, and an inner thick cellulose
layer.3−5 The elemental analysis of the husk indicates 5–10
wt % Si, 0.50 wt % K, 0.07 wt % Na, and 0.6 wt % Al on the basis of
organics.6,7 Thermal treatment of the rice husk in a
controlled atmosphere produces silica particles with high purity,
high surface area, nanometer pores, and high chemical reactivity.8−11 Recently, the rice husk silica has been studied as a sustainable
and environmentally friendly silica source12−25 as well as a multifunctional mesoporous material.26−33 Besides the possible applications of the thermally produced rice
husk silica, there is also a question on the origin of its pore, i.e.,
whether it exists in the fresh rice husk or grows during the thermal
process. To investigate the whole picture, we have conducted studies
on the properties and structure of the silica layer in the fresh rice
husk.3,34 As a result, we report a porous nanoscaled
network in the layer and its interpretation from the view of a mathematical
graph in this study. It is generally understood that the root takes
silicate ions in the water and the silica deposits in the husk. Since
the husk grows very fast in the ripening stage, it has been suggested
that the silica is stored in the stem in the growing stage.34 On the basis of the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images, it is understood that the silica nanoparticle unit starting
from ∼10 nm appears and then aggregates up to ∼50 nm
in the stem in the growing stage. As the amount and size of the silica
particles increases, ∼50 nm clusters aggregate to larger structures
to strengthen the plant in water. In the flowering stage, the units
move to rice husk while the aggregates disappear leaving some stripes
or tracks. From the finding of 10–20 nm silica particles in
the stem and the husk, the 10–20 nm silica nanoparticle unit
is expected to play a key role in the transportation of the silica
from the stem to husk and the building up of the silica layer in the
husk.34 The existence of ∼3.5 nm
pores in the thermally produced rice husk silica suggests that there
are nano-sized pores in the silica layer of the raw husk.35−38 Apparently the rice husk passes oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide
and also protects the living rice grain from microorganisms similar
to eggshells.39,40 The gas permeance through the
raw husk silica layer has been determined experimentally using individual
rice husk sample epoxied to a 2 mm diameter end of a glass tubing
attached to a vacuum system equipped with capacitance manometers and
a mass spectrometer.34 From the observed
permeation of gases before and after the treatment of the husk sample
with hydrogen fluoride solution, the permeance of the silica layer
for hydrogen is estimated to be ∼3 × 10–3 mol s–1 m–2 Pa–1, while the flow was seen to be molecular or Knudsen similar to the
mesoporous membranes (Table 1). This permeance is considerably larger than previously reported
values for silica membranes41−44 and it corresponds to over 1.8% of the incident molecules
on the apparent area. The results suggest that there are through-holes
in the layer and the structure of the holes allows the high gas permeance
as well as the molecular flow is observed.

a The leak rate of gas through a sample
of rice husk was measured under the pressure difference of 1 atm at
298 K using the sample epoxide to a 2 mm diameter end of a glass tubing
attached to a vacuum system equipped with capacitance manometers and
a gas monitoring mass spectrometer. The permeances of samples H and
F, PH and PF were calculated assuming the permeating area of 3.14 × 10–6 m2 while that of the silica layer PS was estimated from 1/PH = 1/PF + 1/PS. The theoretical values of P(H2)/P(CH4); P(H2)/P(CO2) for the molecular and
viscous flows are 2.8; 4.7 and 1.2; 1.6, respectively. The incident
molecule flux Z(G) was calculated from Z(G) = 1/(2πRTM(G))1/2, where R and M(G) are the gas constant and molar
weight of the gas, respectively.

The chemically isolated silica layer shows a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) isotherm with the surface area (A), single
point adsorption pore volume (V) at P/P0 = 0.9917, and adsorption averaged
pore width (4V/A) as 267 m2 g–1, 0.372 cm3 g–1, and 5.6 nm, respectively.45 The BET
isotherm shows the typical hysteresis. The shape of the isotherm can
be classified as type IV of IUPAC classification characterizing a
mesoporous adsorbent with strong affinities46 (Figure S1a). The analysis of the pore
size suggests an existence of 3–5 nm pores using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method47 (Figure S1b). The pore size of the layer is larger than that of the thermally
produced rice husk silica but the pattern of pore size distribution
is similar. The silica layer shows a broad peak with the d spacing of about 0.4 nm (2Θ = 22) in X-ray diffraction as
seen in the thermally produced rice husk silica (Figure S2a). In 29Si NMR, three peaks are observed
at −92, −101, and −110 ppm that correspond to
Q2, Q3, and Q4 states of Si, respectively48 (Figure S2b). This
implies that the silica layer is amorphous, and there are through-nanometer-sized
holes, whose structure allows high gas permeance as well as the molecular
flow is observed. In general, we can imagine two types of pores in
the silica layer. The first is the connection of the spaces between
20 and 60 nm silica particles which was observed in SEM images of
the stem and the husk. The other considerable structure is a straight
nanometer-sized hole, as a micron-sized hole has been found in the
egg shell based on the similarity of the biological respiratory system.39,40 In any case, the images of the hole can be expected in the cross-section
of the layer. Since the resolution of SEM and atomic force microscopy
is not suitable to observe the irregular nanometer-sized holes, an
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study was performed on the osmium
atom-coated cross-section of the silica layer.3 In the STM image, it is apparent that several 10 nm-sized particles
were aggregated to ∼100 nm clusters which is consistent with
the SEM image. However, in the zoom in the STM image and line profile
analysis, deep wells of about 4.5 nm in horizontal length and about
1.7 nm in vertical length were also found. Another well with a horizontal
length of about 1.7 nm and a vertical length of about 4.8 nm was also
observed in another region in the sample. The results are consistent
with the fragments of nanometer-sized holes on the silica (particles
or plates) being covered with osmium atoms showing STM images of the
wells. Here, we report further study on the structure of the holes
of the silica layer with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(TEM).

2 Results and Discussion
The silica layer
is identified as an amorphous phase from the results
of the electron diffraction pattern.

Figure 1a,b shows
cross-sectional TEM micrographs taken from the silica layer. The image
of the layer is composed of two areas, i.e., gray and white contrast
areas. The white contrast is assigned to void spaces in the sample
having 100 nm thickness. The small rectangular parts of the TEM images
have been displayed in Figure 1c,e. If we represent the large white area as a large void
space like a sphere and the smaller white area as a line or a tunnel,
we can draw networks similar to graphs in mathematics (Figure 1e,f). Even though the images
change with the time of electron irradiation (Figure S3) focusing the depth of the electron beam (Figure S4), they appear to be a network (Figure S5). To obtain more specific data, we
constructed a network in different parts of the image through Figure S5. Tables 2 and 3 correspond to the graphs
about the degree of sphere and the length of the tunnel in Figures 1 and S5, respectively. In general, the number of tunnels
connected to a sphere, the sphere in the layer is 2–5, while
the length (projected) of the tunnel is 2–7 nm.

Similar analysis of other TEM images
can also be visualized as
mathematical graphs with the edge (tunnel) and node (sphere) structures.
In graph theory, the number of edges connected to a node is called
the degree of the node. Similarly, we can term the number of tunnels
connected to a sphere as the degree of the sphere. On the basis of
the observed TEM images, the holes in the silica layer are interpreted
as a network of nanometer-sized spheres with tunnels between them.
In contrast, molecular sieve crystals have a defined unit cell with
cavities and channels between the cavities in periodicity.49−51 Here, the sphere and tunnel network does not show distinct replications.
The silica layer has an irregular pore structure, and we cannot apply
the unit cell view with cavities and channels to the layer. In the
view point of understanding amorphous porous materials, especially
in ceramics, it was considered that the pores are the spaces between
the spheres. This hard sphere and the inter-space view were more applicable
to the materials originating from aggregation or sintering of spherical
particles larger than the order of 100 nm. When the size of the constituting
hard sphere is less than ∼100 nm, the increased surface energy
may force a change in the shape of interparticle spaces from the regular
stacking of the spheres. In the movement of atoms in the solid phase
or ions and small nano-sized fragments in the solution toward the
contacting point of a larger particle, the space between the particles
becomes smaller and more rounded. This change induces a new structure
with void spheres and tunnels between the spheres for nano-sized amorphous
porous materials.

For the experimental conditions of the permeance
measurement of
the rice husk, 1 atm and 298 K, the mean free paths λ and the
speed of the gas molecules v are greater than 50
nm and 100 m s–1, respectively.52

Since the length of the tunnels in the layer l is much shorter than λ, collisions between the molecules
as
well as molecule and the inner wall of the tunnel can be neglected
during the passage of the molecule through the tunnel (Figure 2a). Then, the time delay in
a tunnel becomes l × v–1 (∼10–10 s). When the molecules
enter into a nano-sized sphere, they experience numerous collisions
with the inner surface of the sphere (Figure 2b). If there is a negligible interaction
between the molecule and the surface, each collision changes the momentum
of the molecule and the total sum of the momentum of the molecules
is zero. This means the molecules move in all directions in the sphere
after entry. Probably, there is a certain number of collisions needed
before this state can be obtained but it does not need a long time
since the inner surface of the small sphere is not flat atomically.
Let us describe this process as a randomizing scattering or an agitation
of the molecules in the sphere. When a molecular flux enters sphere k through an opening, we can expect a part of the molecular
flux, Ωmk|k/4π,
to go out from the sphere through the opening mk|k after a randomizing scattering at nrs(dk/v + ts), where Ωmk|k, dk, ts, and nrs are the solid angle of the opening mk|k, the diameter of the sphere k, the interacting
time between that inner surface of the sphere, and the number of collisions
needed to reach the randomizing scattering, respectively. After the
first outflow, the retained flux,  experiences the second randomizing scattering
and a part of the flux,  directs to the opening mk|k. Roughly, the entered molecule is
retained in
the sphere for 4πnrs(d/v + ts)/∑m=1nΩmk|k. Since d × v–1 and ts are estimated to be about 10–12 and 10–15 s in the sphere, respectively,
the total time to pass the silica layer is proportional to v–1 and the steady-state gas permeation
shows characteristics of the molecular flow as is seen in the experimental
result. In the case of a network consisting of tunnels and spheres,
we can define the reflection of the sphere i toward
tunnel ij, rij|j as the ratio of flux returning from sphere i to original flux entering sphere i starting
from sphere j (Figure 2c). If the molecules start from sphere j connected to other neighboring spheres through n tunnels, the total returning molecular flux after the first round
trip becomes Sj = ∑i=1n(rji|j × Ωij|j)/∑Ωij|j. In the limit of a large number of round trips, the total
reflection from sphere j through the inlet tunnel
1j, the reflection of the network RN becomes (Ω1j|j/∑Ωij|j) × ∑v=1∞(Sj)v = Ω1j|j/((1 – Sj) × ∑Ωij|j).

Collisions between the molecules can be neglected during the passage
through the network.

The entire porous silica layer can be modeled by considering
a
tree like sphere and tunnel network, T(n) where n is the degree of the spheres (Figure 3b–d). In our
case, the root or parent sphere has one inletting open tunnel and
generates (n – 1) child spheres. Then the
number of kth generation spheres is (n – 1)k. To analyze the root sphere’s
reflection in the tree of k-generations, R0,kT(n), we can
start from the reflectance of the kth generation
leaf spheres, Rk,kT(n) and then calculate that of (k – 1)th generation
spheres, Rk–1,kT(n). Let the leaf sphere have a tunnel connected
to the (k – 1)th generation sphere and (n – 1) open tunnels. Since, the reflectance of the
open tunnel is zero, Rk,kT(n) = 1/n toward (k – 1)th generation sphere when the solid angles of the tunnels
are equal. Let us follow the special case of n =
2 to understand the change in reflectance of the spheres in the identical
tunnels and sphere tree (Figure 3b). Starting from the kth generation
sphere, Rk,kT(2) = 1/2, we
can get the set of {k – x, Rk–x,kT(2)}; {k, 1/2}, {k – 1, 2/3},
{k – 2, 3/4}, ..., {0, (k + 1)/(k + 2)}. Figure 3a shows the change of Rk–x,kT(n) for n and x. The reflectance of
the tree seems to converge to a finite value as k increases as R0|∞T(n) = 1/n.

Figure 3 Schematic change of the reflectance of root
sphere in the sphere
and tunnel network. (a, b) T(2); (c) T(3); and (d) T(4); tree with the degree of spheres, n = 2; 3; and 4, respectively. The fourth generation leaf
spheres of the trees have (n – 1) open tunnels
(e). A graph with cycles, G(4c), transformed from
(d). The leaf sphere has an open tunnel. The number of generations
of (b)–(e), k is 4. It is assumed that all
the solid angles of tunnels Ωij|j are equal for sphere j.

In a finite space, a tree cannot grow to infinite
size, and graphs
with cycles should be considered. In this sort of network, a kth generation sphere is connected to several (k – 1)th generation spheres. When the degree of the kth generation sphere is not changed, the sphere can connect
up to (n – 1) spheres. For example, three
third generation spheres and an open tunnel are connected to one fourth
generation sphere in the network with n = 4 in Figure 3e. The reflections
of spheres in the specific graph or network, R4–x,4G(n) can be estimated as
a set of {k – x, R4–x,4G(4c)}; {4, 3/4}, {3,
4/7}, {2, 7/16}, {1, 16/43}, {0, 43/124} compared to this, the set
of {k – x, R4–x,4T(4)} of the tree of Figure 3d is {4, 1/4}, {3,
4/13}, {2, 13/40}, {1, 40/121}, {0, 121/364}. The reflectance of the
root sphere in the graph converges to the same value of the tree in
the case of the existence of at least one open tunnel in the leaf
sphere. The same number of leaf spheres and their parent spheres in
the graph of Figure 3e means the outer diameter of the network does not increase during
the generation while they start to make a three-dimensional network.
The result suggests that the reflectance of the root sphere in the
high-pressure side depends on the degree of nearby connected spheres
when the spheres far from the root are in cycles with open tunnel(s).
It also means the transmission of a network with specific spheres
and tunnels depends on the degree of the spheres in the network. This
fact can be easily understood physically because the molecules are
moving in an infinite tree without distinguishing the connecting spheres.

On the basis of the discussed properties of the network model,
the high permeance of the silica layer in the rice husk can be explained.
The permeance of the rice husk silica P is Z ·TN·Nt·σt where Z, TN, Nt, and σt are the striking
molecular flux on the surface, the transmittance of the network 1
– RN, the density
of holes per apparent area of the surface, and cross-section of the
hole, respectively. Since P/Z is
about 0.02 in the permeation experiment and TN is 1/2–2/3 from the analysis of the
network with the degree of 3–4, Nt·σt ranges
about 0.04 which is not difficult to imagine in the porous and rough
amorphous surface. It was also observed that the silica layer has
the similar pores and permeation properties even after the treatment
up to ∼1000 K.8,9,25 It
is suggested that the mechanical stability as well as the biological
stability12 of the ∼micrometer silica
layer with the nanoscaled porous network have been proved in the evolutional
processes of the living things.

3 Conclusions
We have developed a new approach for analysis of amorphous, nanoporous
materials based on the network of void spheres and tunnels. This view
point explains the inner structure and the flow characteristics of
the silica layer in rice husk. Specially, the size of the sphere and
tunnels are shorter than the mean free paths of gases, the network
shows gas molecule transmittance depending on the degree of sphere
and the molecular motion strongly related to its speed. As current
nanotechnology mainly focuses on the confinement of electron movement,
the specific system also restricts the movement of traveling molecules
in the network. This means that the new approach can make possible
to design and realize the micro/nano-sized gas phase chemical reactor
system as a technical convergence of chemical engineering technology,
surface science, and micro/nano fabrication techniques of information
technology.

4 Methodology
The inner structure of
the silica layer was investigated with 200
or 300 keV high-resolution TEM. The rice used in this study was harvested
from suburban areas of Gwangju in Republic of Korea from 2006. The
cultivar of rice was Seomyeong (Gyehwa30). The rice husk sample was
obtained by careful cutting of the rice granule with a razor blade.
The sample was washed with acetone and cured at 25 °C for 12
h after imbedding in epoxy resin. The microtomed sections
(approximately 100–150 nm thickness) were cut from the embedded
specimen by an ultramicrotome using a diamond knife at room temperature
and then collected onto 200-mesh Formvar coated copper grids. The
specimen was thinned by ion milling to prepare for high-resolution
TEM.
