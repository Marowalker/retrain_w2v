We observe potential randomization
and constraint of molecular
alignment and orientation in an organic semiconductor molecule with
increasing temperature up to the phase-transition temperature. Variable-angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry and second-harmonic generation are used
to study the changes in the molecular alignment in vapor-deposited
organic thin films as samples are heated and cooled in a cycle from
room temperature to the phase-transition temperature. The films consist
of sterically bulky and cross-shaped molecules, 2-cyano-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene,
and the anisotropy of its two moieties is probed. Anisotropic molecular
alignment with respect to the surface normal in as-deposited amorphous
films changes with the film thickness, which increases slightly with
increasing substrate temperature. Moreover, the axis near the long
axis of the anthracene moiety changes significantly with respect to
the surface normal from the magic angle to isotropic alignment, showing
monotonically decreasing anisotropy. Interestingly, the anisotropy
of the axis near the long axis of the anthracene moiety disappears
before the phase-transition temperature. In contrast, the axis near
the short axis of the anthracene moiety exhibits a notable characteristic
change in the temperature-dependent alignment during the heating process;
although the anisotropy initially decreases, it significantly increases
as the temperature approaches the phase transition. At a certain temperature
during heating, the film thickness shows a discontinuous jump, similar
to a first phase transition, while the anisotropic molecular alignment
completely disappears. During the cooling process after the phase
transition, however, the properties of the films are irreversibly
changed, and anisotropic molecular alignment is no longer observed;
thus, the samples become completely isotropic.

Introduction
Molecular alignment
and orientation are attracting considerable
attention in the field of organic semiconductor materials (OSCs),1−10 which are employed in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),11 organic photovoltaics,12 and organic thin-film transistors.13 Unlike
molecular orientation, molecular alignment specifies the distribution
of molecular axes that have mirror symmetry with respect to a plane
perpendicular to an anisotropic axis of molecular arrangement. Anisotropic
alignment and orientation of organic molecules often play a vital
role in determining the properties of thin films and hence electronic
device characteristics, such as driving voltage and carrier transport
properties. In particular, the molecular alignment should be controlled
for OLEDs to improve their device characteristics: for example, certain
molecular alignments can enhance the light out-coupling efficiency,14,15 device lifetime,16 charge mobility,17−19 energy transfer,20 and so on. However,
even if the molecular alignment in device layers is potentially controlled,
the extent to which molecular alignment can be tuned in amorphous
states made from a particular compound, as well as the physical and
mechanistic origins of this effect, must be understood.

Although
anisotropy with respect to the surface normal in OSC thin
films is not surprising from the viewpoint of surface science,21 the recently raised issues on anisotropy in
amorphous films are significant,1−3,6,10 leading to active studies on molecular alignment
in the organic amorphous thin films used in OLEDs. Generally, an anisotropic
molecular shape is correlated with molecular alignment, and large
anisotropy in the molecular shape gives rise to large alignment anisotropy
in amorphous films, and hence, large optical anisotropy.2−4,17 Presumably, this is due to molecular
interactions with surfaces and other nearby molecules through dipole
and van der Waals interactions, excluded volume effects, etc. Dopant
molecules are also influenced by the molecular alignment of their
host molecules, leading to the alignment of dopant molecules in the
host films.22−25 As the Marcus theory26 shows, the charge
transport rate between molecules is highly dependent on the overlap
and coupling of orbitals between molecules; therefore, molecular alignment
in charge transport layers influences charge transport rates and in
turn the device characteristics.27,28 Molecular
alignment is variable depending on the substrate temperature during
vapor deposition.4

During vapor-deposition
processes, however, the surface mobility
of molecules is an important factor determining molecular alignment,
orientation, and packing structures on substrates, competing with
the thermodynamic force.29−34 The deposition rate and temperature during vapor deposition govern
the surface mobility of molecules;34 if
the deposition is too fast, molecules cannot reach equilibrium at
surfaces, and if the temperature is too low, the rearrangement of
surface molecules is too slow to equilibrate. With this mechanistic
origin, thermodynamically and kinetically stable organic amorphous
states have been created.29 Subsequently,
continuously tunable and thermally stable molecular orientation of
OSC materials has been reported with a parametric ratio between the
substrate temperature and glass transition temperature Tg.34 Indeed, attaining thermally
and kinetically stable packing of molecules in deposited films by
controlling the temperature and deposition rate has been well studied.
However, simple temperature scanning of as-deposited substrates has
not been carefully reported to reveal the molecular alignment in OSC
thin films by heating and cooling in the cycle from room temperature
(RT) to the phase-transition temperature. In particular, this is the
case with bulky molecules with a unique cross shape, in which the
anisotropy of two moieties in the molecule can be simultaneously probed.

On the other hand, we have demonstrated how nonlinear optical spectroscopy
is powerful enough to probe the molecular alignment and orientation
of OSC materials for OLEDs.21 Although
ellipsometry is a viable tool for analyzing molecular alignment,1,35,36 it cannot distinguish the magic
angle and isotropic alignment, whereas second-order nonlinear probing
techniques37 can clarify these different
molecular alignments, as we have successfully demonstrated. We have
also reported the molecular alignment of a uniquely bulky, cross-shaped
molecule, clearly observing its anisotropy by quantitatively analyzing
how molecules sit in as-deposited thin films on average using an advanced
technique beyond linear optics, called sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy.21

In this paper, a simple heating and cooling
cycle is applied
to as-deposited OSC films to observe how the molecular alignment of
sterically bulky, cross-shaped molecules with a small shape anisotropy
changes during the cycle from RT to the phase-transition temperature.
In particular, we can independently probe two different moieties of
the molecule in terms of molecular alignment because the molecule
has two distinctive directional transition dipole moments in the applied
spectral range. We use not only spectroscopic ellipsometry but also
second-harmonic generation (SHG) to more carefully probe changes in
molecular alignment; therefore, the magic angle anisotropic alignment
is clearly distinguishable with isotropy.

Methods
As a uniquely
shaped molecule, 2-cyano-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene
(CADN) is used in this study, and its chemical structure is shown
in Figure 1; the anthracene
and two naphthalene moieties, which are not in the same plane, make
a cross shape. CADN shows two main absorption bands at ∼250
and ∼420 nm, assigned to the transition dipole moments near
the long (y) and short (x) axes
of the anthracene moiety, respectively, as per density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. The molecular structure of CADN is optimized
at the B3LYP/6-31G level using Gaussian 09,38 and a single-point time-dependent DFT calculation is then performed
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The calculated energy and dipole moments
for the transitions from the ground state to the excited states are
summarized in Supporting Information. Based
on the calculated wavelength and oscillator strength, the absorption
bands at ∼250 and ∼420 nm can be assigned to the transitions
from the ground state to the excited states at 252.51 and 419.94 nm,
with oscillator strengths of 0.7865 and 0.1863, respectively (Table S1). The corresponding transition dipole
moment to the absorption band at ∼250 nm is x = −0.662, y = −2.4574, z = −0.2476, and that at ∼420 nm is x = 1.5461, y = −0.4293, z = −0.0234 (Table S1). These two
transition dipole moments are almost orthogonal, while the transition
dipole moment at ∼250 nm, which is due to the CN atomic group
attached to the anthracene moiety, is slightly tilted by ∼16°
from the y-axis. These assignments are very similar
to those reported for the 2-methyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (MADN)
molecule.21

CADN and the directions of the two transition
dipole moments in the molecule.

N,N′-Di(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine)
(NPB) is also prepared as a reference, which has been more thoroughly
studied by other groups.2,6,10,15,34,39,40 The sample
films are formed by vacuum vapor deposition on Si wafer substrates.
Each substrate is cleaned with a 1.0% tetramethylammonium hydroxide
aqueous solution and subsequently rinsed with pure water (>18 Ω
cm). After being dried with N2 gas, the surface of the
substrates is cleaned by UV–ozone generation. Then, samples
are thermally vapor-deposited onto the substrates at RT in a vacuum
chamber of less than 10–4 Pa at the evaporation
rate of ∼0.1 nm/s. The thickness of the films is set to 100
nm. The films are not thermally treated until the measurements.

Variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE)35,36 is performed using a fast spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000U, J.
A. Woollam Co., Inc.). Measurements are recorded at multiple incidence
angles ranging from 45 to 75° with 5° steps, and experimental
ellipsometric parameters Ψ and Δ are simultaneously obtained
throughout the spectral region from 245 to 1000 nm. The samples are
heated and cooled in a cycle between 25 and 145 °C (CADN) or
115 °C (NPB) in 5 °C intervals. At each temperature, measurements
are recorded after stabilizing for 1 min. Using an iterative procedure,
namely, the least-squares minimization, unknown optical constants
and/or thickness parameters are varied, and Ψ and Δ values
are calculated with the Fresnel equations. The calculated Ψ
and Δ values matching the experimental data best provide the
optical constants (n, the refractive index, and k, the extinction coefficient) and the film thickness d of the samples. We carefully chose either an isotropic
or an anisotropic model to fit the VASE data such that the mean-squared
error (MSE) values are less than 10. This value does not have a physical
meaning and is commonly accepted as a criterion, and the published
data are actually within this standard. The surface potential of the
films is measured using a Kelvin probe (KP020, KP Technology). SHG
measurements are carried out only for the CADN sample. A 200 fs pulse
train at 80 MHz from a titanium-doped sapphire laser oscillator (Vitesse,
Coherent Inc.) is used as a fundamental light. The sample film deposited
on a fused silica plate is set in a temperature-controlled furnace
with light-transmission windows. The fundamental light beam is directed
to the sample film at 45°. Since SHG is a nonlinear effect typically
induced by strong light fields, a plano-convex lens (f = 100 mm) is used to focus the fundamental light on the sample.
The SHG photons at 400 nm are detected by a cooled photomultiplier
equipped with a digital photon-counting unit (H7421-40 with C8855-01,
Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Glan-prism polarizers are used for the
fundamental and SHG lights to examine the polarization dependence
of signals. Similar to the ellipsometry measurements, the sample temperature
is scanned stepwise by heating and cooling. At each temperature, the
SHG intensity is recorded after stabilizing for 1 min.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2a shows
how the film thickness of vapor-deposited CADN at RT as the substrate
temperature varies, as determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. The
molecules in the as-deposited films at RT must be packed in a well-balanced,
optimized way because of the thermodynamic force that competes with
the surface mobility of molecules during vapor deposition.34 During the heating process from RT, the as-deposited
film expands as a solid phase because of the activation of molecular
vibrations and rotations, thereby decreasing the density of films
and increasing the film thickness. At Tonset, which is higher than Tg, the amorphous
as-deposited film begins to change phase from solid to liquid and
transforms into a supercooled liquid (SCL). At this temperature, the
film thickness changes abruptly and discontinuously, similar to a
first phase transition. When the sample, which has entirely become
an SCL, is gradually cooled at a controlled rate, the thickness linearly
decreases until the temperature reaches Tg. Below Tg, the film enters another amorphous
state as a glassy liquid-cooled solid phase. Since the coefficient
of thermal expansion differs between the SCL and glass states, the
slope of the change in film thickness with temperature is different.
Performing measurements under ambient atmosphere or N2 atmosphere
does not affect these observations. As a reference, an as-deposited
NPB film was also measured during the same heating and cooling cycle.
The observations in Figure 2b are similar to those of previous studies,34 thus confirming the reliability of the measurement and
analysis procedures. The similarity in the behavior of the two samples
suggests that CADN molecules are similar to the NPB molecules on the
substrates under the temperature scanning of the as-deposited films
in terms of the temperature dependence of the film thickness.

heating and cooling cycle from RT to phase transition: (a) CADN; (b)
NPB. The thickness data are obtained by VASE.

How does the molecular alignment in the as-deposited amorphous
film change during a single cycle of heating and cooling from RT to
the phase-transition temperature? The counterpart parameters determined
together with the film thickness d by VASE are the
optical constants n and k. With
the obtained k, Figure 3 shows how the order parameter S of the as-deposited films changes with temperature. We carefully
and consistently chose either a uniaxial or an isotropic fitting model
and fit the data to deduce n and k. During heating, the anisotropic model with respect to the surface
normal is inevitably needed to maintain the quality of the fit. The
order parameter S is described as follows41,42  where ke and ko are the extinction coefficients for the surface
normal and the surface plane, respectively. Using the absorption bands
due to the transition dipole moments in the directions close to the
long (y-axis) and short (x-axis)
to the anthracene moiety of the CADN molecule, namely, 250 and 420
nm, respectively, the order parameter S for these
directions in the CADN molecule can be independently obtained from
the deduced ke and ko values at each wavelength. For the short axis of the anthracene
moiety of the CADN molecule, the order parameter S at RT was determined to be S = ∼−0.3,
which means that the two naphthalene moieties tend to be roughly parallel
to the surface. In terms of the molecular conformation, the two naphthalene
units may show the anti or syn conformations. However, they cannot
be distinguished in this study because the difference between how
the two conformations appear in the UV–visible spectra is not
clear. However, even if the two conformations are present in the film
at a certain ratio, the absorption wavelengths due to the two distinctive
dipoles do not change as long as the ratio does not change. In fact,
the spectra obtained from VASE are the same in terms of the absorption
wavelength throughout the experiments. In Figure 3a, the absolute values of S initially decrease during heating until ∼370 K, suggesting
that increasing temperature activates the vibrations and rotations
of the molecules and slightly randomizes the initial alignment structure.
Interestingly, however, S decreases further toward S = ∼−0.5, suggesting that the anisotropy
increases as the temperature further increases until the phase transition.
This means that with increasing temperature, the two naphthalene moieties
of the molecules turn to align in directions parallel to the surface
of the substrate. This surprising finding was determined extremely
carefully to deduce the optical constants n and k with the thickness d, as described above.
In the solid state of the as-deposited CADN thin films, the isotropic
model gives only the nonstandard values MSE = ∼15–20,
enabling us to consistently use the anisotropic model. Notably, the
anisotropy, which first slightly decreases because of randomization,
but increases with increasing temperature until the phase transition,
can also be observed for the NPB films (Figure 3b). For both cases, the fitting quality is
still good with the values of MSE = 4–7, indicating that the
results are reliable.

Figure 3 Dependence of the order parameter S on
temperature
during a single heating and cooling cycle from RT to phase transition:
(a) CADN; (b) NPB. The data on the order parameter S are obtained by VASE. The solid lines are visual guides.

In addition to the anthracene moiety’s short
axis, the order
parameters S were deduced for its long axis and compared
with those of its counterpart in Figure 3a. The value of S at RT
was determined to be S = ∼0.05, which is almost
zero. However, this does not mean that the alignment is almost isotropic;
in a previous study, we revealed that the long axis of the anthracene
moiety of MADN molecules,21 which are identical
to CADN except for the atomic group attached to the anthracene moiety,
sit in the as-deposited thin films at the magic angle with respect
to the surface normal. Presumably, the molecular orientation of the
CADN molecules in this case is more or less similar to that of the
MADN molecules in the previous study. During heating from RT to phase
transition, the values of S decrease almost monotonically
and approach S = 0. Interestingly, as further evidence
of the anisotropic molecular orientation (not alignment) in the as-deposited
thin films at RT, the Kelvin probe technique reveals how the vacuum
level and work function change as the deposited film thickness increases
(Figure 4). The vacuum
level of the film with no thermal treatment gradually shifts as a
function of the film thickness, whereas the film annealed over 145
°C shows a change in the vacuum level only at the interface.
These results were also previously obtained for the MADN films.21 Comparing the results in Figure 4a,b reveals how significantly large polarizations
are created in the bulk of the as-deposited CADN film. The results
support the different molecular orientations (not alignment) depending
on the temperature treatment of the film on substrates. The gradual
change in the vacuum level observed at RT suggests that the dipoles
of molecules are oriented in a certain way, and these dipoles are
accumulated along the thickness direction from the surface of the
substrate to the bulk of CADN; thus, a large polarization is formed
in the bulk. Therefore, the orientation of the anthracene moiety is
not isotropic, but anisotropic in the bulk of as-deposited films at
RT.

Figure 4 Shift in the vacuum level as a function of the film thickness of
(a) CADN and (b) NPB. The solid lines are visual guides.

As another notable characteristic, before the substrate
temperature
reaches the phase-transition temperature during heating, the anisotropy
of the molecular alignment is quasi-reversible. Figure 5 shows how the anisotropy remains in the
CADN films when the maximum heating temperature is below the phase
transition. In the first cycle of heating and cooling, the initially
observed anisotropy clearly remains with a slight variation when the
films are cooled slowly back to RT; yet, it is hard to conclude that
the anisotropy slightly increased or decreased after the first temperature
scan. However, this variation may have been caused by the slight change
in the molecular alignment at increased temperatures. During the second
temperature scan, the parameters in the heating and the cooling processes
are quite reproducible, suggesting that the first heating process
released distorted mechanical stresses in the molecular packing and
stabilized the molecular alignment.

Figure 5 Temperature dependence of the film thickness
(a, c) and the order
parameter (b, d) of the CADN film, respectively. The temperature is
varied by heating and cooling in a single cycle from RT (298 K) to
378 K. (a, b) First scan; (c, d) second scan.

When the phase transition begins at 418 K, Tonset, the isotropic model becomes appropriate, satisfying
the criteria MSE < 10, which suggests that the solid-to-SCL transition
indeed accompanies the disappearance of the anisotropic molecular
alignment. After the phase transition for both CADN and NPB films,
the isotropic model provides a good fit; therefore, all order parameters S during cooling are zero, meaning that the anthracene moieties
of the CADN molecules are randomly aligned in the films. Anisotropic
molecular alignment can only be observed in the amorphous solid phase
of virgin as-deposited films, which have not experienced the phase
transition with increasing temperature. Although the as-deposited
films are heated above Tonset and the
films experience a phase transition, anisotropic molecular alignment
is no longer observed in the amorphous solid phase obtained by decreasing
the temperature.

We also use SHG, a second-order nonlinear optical
technique, as
a complementary probing method to clarify the molecular orientations
in the deposited CADN films. Since the CN group is a strong electron
acceptor, the molecule itself should have a large permanent dipole
moment. In such a case, SHG probes the macroscopic polar ordering
of the molecules in the sample film. However, the hyperpolarizability
(β) along the CN axis of the anthracene moiety is not necessarily
dominant because of the two naphthalene units and the partial overlap
of the absorption band of the short axis of the anthracene with the
SHG wavelength. According to the DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level, we obtain |βζζζ/βηηη| ∼ 200 for 4-cyano-4′-penthylbiphenyl,
whereas |βζζζ/βηηη| ∼ 3.4 for CADN (Table S2), wherein
the ζ-axis is set along the CN axis, with the η axis being
in the plane of the two naphthalene units. β along the CN axis
of the anthracene moiety is not dominant, but is the largest in the
CADN molecule. Here, we do not need to use SHG to quantitatively determine
the molecular orientation of CADN; the molecular orientation is already
obtained by analyzing the nonlinear susceptibilities using sum-frequency
generation spectroscopy, as performed in the previous study with MADN,21 which also exhibits similar behaviors in the
VASE measurements. SHG is more beneficial for the present study because
it provides a simplified method to probe how the polar structure changes
as a function of temperature.

In the as-deposited film, clear
signals are confirmed for the p-polarized
fundamental and p-polarized SHG condition, indicating polar ordering.
To further verify the symmetric property, the nonlinear susceptibility
tensor χ̅ was examined by observing how the
SHG signal varies upon rotation of the input polarization. Figure 6a,b show the variation
in the p- and s-polarized SHG signals as a function of the input polarization
angle, defined as the relative angle between the incident plane and
the polarization of the fundamental light. These experimental data
can be simultaneously fitted, as shown by the broken lines in Figure 6a,b, with Fresnel
factors and the film thickness ignored for simplification. The optical
resonance effect, that is, imaginary contributions in χ̅, is also ignored. Under these assumptions, the formation of χ̅ was determined to be  where the Z-axis is normal
to the film and the X-axis is parallel to the intersection
line of the film and the light-incident planes. The values were normalized
with χZZZ = 1. Clearly, SHG mainly
arises from five components, χZZZ, χZXX, χZYY, χYYZ, and χXZX, whereas the others were almost eliminated. Actually,
these five components correspond to the nonvanished ones for the C∞V point group (with
the ∞-fold axis parallel to the Z-axis). This
result is reasonable because the present system is considered polar,
but nearly isotropic in the film plane, as inferred by VASE and surface
potential experiments. Notably, the so-called Kleinman’s law,
χZXX = χXZX and χZYY = χYYZ, is satisfied, ensuring the validity of the assignment.

dependences of (a) p-polarized and (b) s-polarized SHG signals. Error
bars are given by the standard deviations. The numerical calculations
(dotted curves) well fit the experimental results. (c) Temperature
dependence of the SHG signals during heating (red squares) and cooling
(blue open circles).

SHG signals should also vary with temperature. Figure 6c shows the SHG signals for
p-polarized fundamental and p-polarized SHG lights monitored while
heating and cooling the sample film. Upon heating to about 370 K,
the initial signal slightly decreases, clearly corresponding to the
behavior of S (Figure 3a), that is, increasing temperature activates molecular
motion and randomizes the initial molecular orientations. Then, the
signal significantly drops toward Tg,
above which the signal is almost negligible. The SHG signals of the
long axis of the anthracene moiety decrease with increasing temperature
because of randomization, while the axis of the two naphthalene moieties
becomes flatter on the surface with azimuthal isotropy, which also
reduces the SHG signals. Thus, the molecular orientations are fully
randomized by the phase transition, after which the polar ordering
never recovers, even by cooling to almost RT.

Figure 7 schematically
illustrates the molecular orientations of the CADN molecules in the
films at RT and their approximate changes with increasing temperature.
Based on the previous study using sum-frequency generation spectroscopy
on MADN and the VASE observations of CADN, which are similar to those
of MADN,21 the molecular orientation of
the CADN molecules can be depicted as in Figure 7a. The short axis of the anthracene moiety
slightly tilts from the surface plane, but preferentially stays close
to the surface with a certain orientational distribution. Meanwhile,
on average, the long axis of the anthracene moiety is oriented close
to the magic angle from the surface normal.

Figure 7 Schematics of (a) the
molecular orientation of the CADN molecules
at RT and (b) changes in their molecular orientation with increasing
temperature. Blue arrows: randomization of the anthracene with respect
to the polar angle. Red arrows: azimuthal rotation.

Interestingly, randomization and constraint of
the molecular alignment
and orientation are observed to coexist in the CADN molecule as the
temperature increases toward the phase transition. Specifically, the
long axis of the anthracene moiety is randomized, becoming isotropic
from the previously anisotropic orientation at the magic angle, whereas
the short axis of the anthracene, which is the long axis along the
two naphthalene moieties, shows the opposite behavior, i.e., increasing
anisotropy of the molecular alignment. These molecular alignments
and orientations are possible because the polar angle with respect
to the surface normal is the only influencing factor, and the system
is azimuthally isotropic with free twist rotations around the axes. Figure 7b illustrates such
changes in the molecular orientation of a CADN molecule with increasing
temperature, especially close to the phase-transition temperature.
Note that these molecular orientations are not at the surface but
in the bulk. The long axis of the anthracene moiety can be randomized
with respect to the polar angle, whereas the axis of the two naphthalene
moieties remains almost parallel to the surface plane of the substrate.
The blue arrows indicate the changes in the molecular motion of the
anthracene moiety. The axis of the two naphthalene units can remain
in the surface plane regardless of the tilting of the anthracene moiety
with respect to the polar angle. Surprisingly, the axis of the two
naphthalene units becomes flatter on the surface, demonstrating this
restricted behavior. The entire molecules are azimuthally isotropic.
In Figure 7b, the red
arrows indicate the possible azimuthal rotations. The randomized and
constrained parts of the molecules may compensate the total entropy
of the whole molecular system.

Since the CADN molecule has two
moieties, the alignment and orientation
of which can be simultaneously probed, we observe almost the opposite
behaviors: the randomization and constraint of both molecular alignment
and orientation in the molecule. However, this is not observed with
other typical OSC molecules. We probe the degree of molecular motions
through the order parameters of the molecules using VASE. The similarity
between the trends of the CADN and NPB molecules arises from their
similar behaviors, i.e., that their molecular motions become active
and randomized with increasing temperature. However, our study suggests
that not all parts of a molecule can necessarily be randomized uniformly
as the temperature increases. One moiety of a molecule becomes randomized
with increasing temperature, but another moiety exhibits the opposite
behavior near the phase-transition temperature. This is the case with
CADN in this study, which is presumably similar to MADN. However,
NPB may also exhibit the same feature. The only difference between
CADN and NPB is the number of axes (moieties) of the molecule that
can be probed using VASE. We can independently probe the two distinctive
moieties in the case of CADN, but we can monitor only one axis of
the molecule in the case of NPB. Nonetheless, we may be able to extend
these observations to other molecular systems, including NPB. Not
all parts of a molecule would be necessarily randomized in the same
way in terms of the molecular alignment and orientation with increasing
temperature; one part of the moiety may be randomized, whereas another
part of the moiety may be restricted and constrained as the temperature
approaches the phase-transition temperature.

Conclusions
In
summary, randomization and constraint are found to coexist in
the CADN molecular alignment and orientation. Using VASE and SHG,
we observed changes in the molecular alignment and orientation of
CADN molecules in vapor-deposited films by heating and cooling the
samples in a cycle from RT to the phase-transition temperature. In
the as-deposited amorphous films at RT, the anisotropic alignment
of the short axis of the anthracene moiety, that is, the naphthalene
moiety, is roughly parallel to the surface of the substrates, whereas
the long axis of the anthracene moiety is closely oriented by the
magic angle with respect to the surface normal. Although the anisotropic
alignment of the naphthalene moiety initially decreases during heating,
the anisotropy notably increases as the temperature approaches the
film’s phase-transition temperature. The anthracene moiety’s
long axis significantly changes as the anisotropic orientation decreases
monotonically with respect to the surface normal from the magic angle
to isotropy. The initial order parameter S of the
long axis of the anthracene moiety is almost zero; however, it is
not isotropic, but anisotropic, and the orientation is almost the
magic angle, as verified by SHG signals. As the film temperature increases,
the SHG signals weaken monotonically, and eventually, no SHG signals
are observed, corresponding to the isotropic orientation. The isotropic
orientation of the anthracene moiety’s long axis below the
phase-transition temperature is also notable, with the axis of the
two naphthalene units being more constrained and flat on the surface
plane. After heating above this temperature, all molecular orientations
are isotropic. Probing the anisotropy of the CADN molecule’s
two moieties potentially reveals that the molecular alignment and
orientation undergo a two-step transformation through the coexistence
of randomization and constraint of parts of the molecule as the temperature
varies near the phase-transition temperature.
