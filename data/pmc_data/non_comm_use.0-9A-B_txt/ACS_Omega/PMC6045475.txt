The aim of this work is to develop
a series of advanced biobased
tougheners for thermosetting epoxy resins suitable for high-performance
applications. These bio-rubber (BR) tougheners were prepared via a
one-step chemical modification of epoxidized soybean oil using biobased
hexanoic anhydride. To investigate their toughening performance, these
BR tougheners were blended with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy
monomers at various weight fractions and cured with anhydride hardeners.
Significant improvements in fracture toughness properties, as well
as minimal reductions in glass transition temperature (Tg), were observed. When 20 wt % of a BR toughener was
utilized, the critical stress intensity factor and critical strain
energy release rate of a thermosetting matrix were enhanced by >200
and >500%, respectively, whereas the Tg was reduced by only 20 °C. The phase-separated domains were
evenly dispersed across the fracture surfaces as observed through
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Moreover,
domain sizes were demonstrated to be tunable within the micrometer
range by altering the toughener molecular structure and weight fractions.
These BR tougheners demonstrate the possibility of achieving toughness
while having the thermal properties of standard bisphenol epoxy thermosetting
resins.

1 Introduction
Epoxy
resins are one of the most versatile thermosetting materials
with a broad range of industrial applications.1,2 Epoxy–anhydride
resins are used in high-performance fiber-reinforced composites, electric
insulation, casting, potting, encapsulation, and chemical resistance
applications.3 Generally, the requirements
for these applications are high glass transition temperatures and
high fracture strength.3

Epoxy resins
are intrinsically brittle and have poor resistance
to crack propagation due to their high cross-link density.4 Therefore, toughening such systems to broaden
their applications and improve their durability for existing applications
has been a challenging topic to both academia and industry. Introducing
a secondary phase into the matrix is one of the major strategies of
toughening epoxy resins. By this method, liquid rubber5−7 and thermoplastic8−10 components are introduced in the formulation and
subsequent phase separation produces morphologies that contribute
to the toughening effects.11−14 However, this strategy tends to result in significant
reduction in mechanical and thermal properties.15 Others have also examined the use of micro- and nanocomposites
for toughening using clay,16 carbon nanotubes,17 and graphene,2 but
these negatively affect the processing ease, especially when applied
in the manufacture of continuous-fiber polymer matrix composites.18,19 In addition, although particulate additives generally improve the
modulus, there are conflicting results regarding the magnitude of
toughening, with various reports of small toughening effect (≤40%).20 Polymer matrix toughening could be used in conjunction
with particulate additives to provide additional improvement of the
material properties.

An important challenge is to toughen an
epoxy resin without compromising
the overall thermal and mechanical properties, such as strength, modulus,
and glass transition temperature.

Recently, a considerable amount
of research has been carried out
to toughen epoxy resins using various biobased materials, among which
vegetable oils are considered promising candidates because they are
sustainable.21−27 Epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) has attracted great interest due to
its moderate viscosity, good miscibility with epoxy resins, easy availability,
and low cost. ESO is produced by the conversion of the double bonds
of soybean oils into secondary oxiranes to obtain materials with an
average of 4 to 4.4 epoxy groups per triglyceride.24,28−30 Altuna and co-workers studied various anhydride-cured
ESO/diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) systems and reported that
the optimum property composition was DGEBA with 40 wt % ESO, an impact
strength increase of 38% and a Tg reduction
of 11 °C.31 Miyagawa and co-workers
evaluated the fracture behaviors of anhydride-cured epoxy networks
modified with ESO and epoxidized linseed oil (ELO) and found that
the fracture toughness was not affected by adding ELO, but was significantly
improved by blending 30 wt % ESO.32 A heterogeneous
polymer network is developed during curing process due to the large
difference in the reactivity of secondary epoxy in ESO and terminal
epoxy in DGEBA, which leads to phase-separated network structure.
The epoxy ring opening reaction has been employed to obtain ESO grafted
with various chemical moieties including, diamine,33 azide,34 fatty acids (FAs),11 allyl group,35 acrylates36 diester,37 ketals,38,39 and others.40,41

An epoxy toughener superior
to that of ESO is needed to significantly
improve the fracture properties while maintaining processing ease
and thermal properties. Literature suggests that a very high content
(30–40 wt %) of ESO is required to observe the distinguishable
toughening effect in the epoxy matrix. Furthermore, the largest improvements
in fracture properties using ESO were small (≤40%).31 Other methodologies for toughening resulted
in moderate effects or significant lowering of the glass transition
temperature and/or increase in the resin viscosity.42 An epoxy toughener can be developed that increases the
fracture properties by a factor of 2 or more, while having no more
than 10% effect on the viscosity and glass transition temperature.

In previous work, FA of various chain lengths were grafted on ESO
via an esterification reaction to prepare the bio-rubber (BR) tougheners.11 These BR tougheners were used to toughen the
epoxy–amine systems as well as vinyl esters resins.11 The FA-grafted ESO tougheners were used with
epoxy–anhydride systems but phase separation did not occur
because of the hydroxyl groups (OH) generated during grafting. The
hydroxyl groups on tougheners further react with anhydride curing
agents and plasticize the network, which prevents the phase separation.
Therefore, in this work, a grafting methodology was applied that avoided
the OH generation on the BR. A series of BR tougheners were prepared
by grafting different molar ratios of fatty alkyl anhydrides to ESO,
which results in the diester derivatives of ESO without the OH groups.11,43 These BR tougheners were formulated with Epon 828 as well as a mixture
of Epon 828 and 1001F (high-molecular-weight epoxy) at various weight
fractions and cured with anhydride hardeners. The structure–property
relationships of BR-toughened epoxy–anhydride systems were
evaluated with the goal of producing a series of modified ESO tougheners
with significantly improved properties compared to pure ESO. The effects
of BR on thermomechanical properties and fracture toughness of the
prepared epoxy resin systems were discussed and related to the polymer
morphologies observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Anhydride-Modified
ESO
A method was explored for the preparation of ESO-based
BR that eliminates
the formation of hydroxyl groups on the BR tougheners. The ESO was
modified via hexanoic anhydride in the presence of boron trifluoride
etherate in an anhydrous solvent, which results in FA diester derivatives
of ESO (Scheme 1).
Boron trifluoride etherate is used as a catalyst to simultaneously
open the oxirane and activate the hexanoic anhydride (Scheme 2). The prepared BR were characterized
using different techniques such as mid-IR, epoxy titration (ASTM D1652-97),
and rheometry. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of pure
ESO and synthesized bio-rubbers (A-HEX-1, A-HEX-2, and A-HEX-3) are
shown in Figure 2.

The extent of epoxy ring opening was determined from the
intensity
ratio of the epoxy peak at 842 and 823 cm–1 in the
mid-IR spectra (Figure 2).37 The epoxy peak decreased in intensity
from ESO to A-HEX-1, A-HEX-2, and finally to A-HEX-3 due to the increase
in ester functionalities in the structure. In the case of A-HEX-3,
the largest number of ESO epoxy groups was converted to diester derivatives
of hexanoic anhydride by the ring-opening reaction. It was also supported
by the increase in peak intensity ratio of the peak at 1375 cm–1 relative to the peak at 1461 cm–1, confirming the formation of diester derivatives of hexanoic anhydride.
The FTIR spectra of all of these samples, ESO, and hexanoic derivatives
have a peak at 1740 cm–1, which is caused by the
triglyceride carbonyl stretching, a peak at 1461 cm–1 for CH2 bending vibration, a peak at 1375 cm–1 for CH3 symmetrical bending vibration, and peaks at 1240,
1158, and 1100 cm–1 due to the stretching vibrations
of C–O group in esters.37,41

The evaluation
of epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) of ESO and BR was
carried out via ASTM D1652-97 method, and the theoretical value of
EEW was calculated using the chemical structures and ratio of reactants
used (Table 1). The
values of EEW and molecular weight of BR increased with increased
hexanoic ester functionality, both theoretically and experimentally.
There are some differences between the experimental and theoretical
values that are likely due to homopolymerization of epoxy. The viscosity
of the ESO and BR was measured using an AR2000 ex rheometer (TA Instruments).
The modifications of ESO do not alter the viscosity (>50 Pa s)
much,
although it does increase some with increasing FA ester functionality
(Table 1).

2.2 Extent of Cure
The cure mechanism
of the epoxy with the anhydride as detailed by Thomas et al.44 is shown in Scheme 3. The dimethyl benzyl amine serves as a catalyst
in the ring opening of  the anhydride to form a reactive anionic
species that initiates polymerization. The oxygen anions react with
the epoxy group as well as with the anhydride to form a cross-linked
structure.44

of Epoxy Resin and Anhydride Curing Agent
The near-IR spectra of cured samples are plotted in Figure 3, including the spectrum
of
the unreacted mixture for Epon 828/BR/ECA100NC. The epoxy peak was
observed at 4530 cm–1 in the precured sample, whereas
this peak clearly disappeared after curing, indicating complete reaction
in the cured samples within the limits of infrared spectroscopy measurements.45

2.3 Thermal–Mechanical
Properties of BR-Toughened
Thermosetting Polymers
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
was used to investigate the stiffness and damping characteristics
of the modified thermosetting polymers. The dynamic mechanical properties
were measured from 25 to 200 °C. The change in storage modulus
and loss modulus of representative samples are shown in Figure 4 and tabulated in Table 2 with additional
data from other systems. Figure 4a shows DMA traces for systems of
increasing BR content and Figure 4b shows DMA traces for systems modified with BR having
different degree of  grafting.

a Tg taken
as peak of loss modulus (E″).

The storage for all of the samples
at room temperature are in the
range of 1.75–2.00 GPa. In general, the storage moduli of
blend samples was lower than those of the neat epoxy system. This
may be due to the incorporation of less stiff BR toughener.31,32,46 However, there were a few cases
where the BR samples had a higher room temperature modulus, such as
in the case of 10%A-HEX-3–90%Epon 828-EC.

All of the
samples had narrow loss modulus peaks. The loss modulus
peak shifted to a lower temperature with increasing amount of BR,
indicating a gradual decrease in Tg as
the rigid Epon 828 network became more flexible with the introduction
of the BR chains allowing a higher chain mobility.31 Similarly, Tg also decreased
with the incorporation of unmodified ESO, and generally, samples with
ESO had similar Tg’s as samples
with A-HEX-1 for the same BR/ESO content. The Tg was found to decrease as the level of fatty ester modification
of the BR increased. For example, the incorporation of 10 wt % A-HEX-1,
A-HEX-2, and A-HEX-3 has Tg in a decreasing
order of 135, 131, and 123 °C, respectively. The higher molecular
weight of the toughener may also play a role in reducing the Tg of the A-HEX-2 and A-HEX-3 series compared
with A-HEX-1. Yet, the BR type was observed to have a less pronounced
effect on Tg relative to the BR content.

Another curing agent, methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA),
was also used to determine whether the thermomechanical property trends
were sensitive to the specific curing agent used. Samples were prepared
with Epon 828 and 20 wt % of modified ESO and cured with MHHPA (Table 3 and Figure S1).

Similar results were observed when
compared with that of the ECA100NC.
The neat Epon 828 cured with MHHPA had a Tg at 138 °C and, after the incorporation of 20 wt % of ESO, Tg of A-HEX-1, A-HEX-2, and A-HEX-3 decreased
to 115, 117, 115, and 109 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the
magnitude of Tg reduction for the MHHPA-cured
samples upon addition of 20 wt % ESO or BR is very similar to that
of the EXA100NC-cured samples. The epoxy blend system with 15 wt %
of EPON1001F and 85 wt % Epon 828 was prepared to verify the impact
of the toughener on a higher-molecular-weight epoxy system (Table 3 and Figure S1). These samples also followed the same trend as
the other samples, with the nontoughened sample having the highest Tg, followed by A-HEX-1, then ESO, and A-HEX-3.
The magnitude of Tg reduction for the
samples with EPON1001F as a function of BR/ESO was similar to that
for Epon 828 samples.

2.4 Fracture Properties of
BR-Toughened Thermosetting
Polymer
Fracture toughness test was carried out to measure
the toughening effects of the BR in Epon 828 anhydride-cured system. Tables 2, 3, and Figures S2, S3 show the fracture
toughness of the Epon 828 with various amounts of ESO and BR. The
critical stress intensity factor (KIc)
and the critical strain energy release rate (GIc) were improved with the addition of BR, whereas the addition
of ESO had no significant effect until 25 wt % was added to the resin
(Table 2 and Figure S2). Furthermore, the toughness values
generally increased as the BR content in the resin increased. The
level of epoxidation of the BR may have an effect on the toughness
values, but differences among the samples were generally insignificant
because of the sizeable error bars, which are typical for these measurements.
Moreover, it appears that increasing the BR content from 20 to 25
wt % does not have a significant effect on the toughness values. Among
all of the samples, the one with 20 wt % A-HEX-2 demonstrated the
highest toughening effect with a >200% increase in KIc and >500% increase in GIc with respect to neat Epon 828 cured with ECA100NC. Furthermore,
this improvement resulted in only a 20 °C reduction in the Tg values.

For Epon 828 samples cured with
MHHPA, 20 wt % BR again significantly improved the toughness values,
as KIc (1.26 ± 0.31 MPa m1/2) and GIc (0.76 ± 0.38 kJ/m2) were much higher than those for the Epon 828 MHHPA sample
with and without the ESO additive (Table 3 and Figure S3).

To verify the impact of the toughener on a higher-molecular-weight
polymer, the epoxy blend system was prepared with 15 wt % of EPON1001F
and 85 wt % Epon 828. The toughener (20 wt % of ESO, A-HEX-1, A-HEX-2,
and A-HEX-3) was incorporated into the prepared high-molecular epoxy
system of Epon 828/1001F and cured with ECA100NC and MHHPA. Similarly,
20 wt % BR produced a high fracture toughness, whereas 20 wt % ESO
did not. The two anhydride curing agents produced similar fracture
properties for common sample formulations. Although the EPON1001F
blend system has a higher molecular weight compared to the Epon 828
resin, the KIc value for the 20%A-HEX-2–15%
1001F-EC (1.21 ± 0.12 MPa m1/2) was lower than the
20%A-HEX-2–Epon 828-EC system (1.41 ± 0.18 MPa m1/2). This may be due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the DGEBA
oligomers in EPON100F, which may react with the remaining epoxy groups
on BR and become a part of the network chain, which further suppresses
the toughening effect (Table 3 and Figure S2).

Although
fracture behavior was not examined in detail to explain
the observed toughening effects, it is likely that shear localization
was enhanced due to BR particles serving as stress concentrators.5,47,48 Pearson and co-workers8,49 have explained that the two main factors responsible for toughening
in rubber-toughened systems are cavitation and the generation of
shear bands.

2.5 Fracture Surface Analysis
of BR-Toughened
Thermosetting Polymers
Evaluation of fracture morphology
is important to investigate the secondary phase network and the particle
size of BR in the polymer matrix. The fracture morphology of the toughened
epoxy system was investigated by SEM. In the case of 20 wt % ESO (Figures 5 and 6), the brittleness of the sample can be observed by the presence
of smooth glassy fracture surface with cracks in different planes.
Thus, it is not surprising that this material displayed weak resistance
to crack propagation.

828-EC.

828-EC, and (d) 25%A-HEX-2–75%Epon 828-EC.

The lack of any significant morphology suggests that the
ESO fully
reacted into the system and became part of the network. Interestingly,
the samples were clear and transparent, and macroscopic phase separation
was not observed at even higher loadings of up to 20 wt % of ESO (Figure S4). Opacity is only observed at 25 wt
% ESO upon which the fracture toughness improves significantly. On
the other hand, the BR samples with only 10 wt % BR were opaque and
cloudy. The SEM image of BR-toughened epoxies (20% A-HEX-1, A-HEX-2,
and A-HEX-3 cured with ECA100NC) clearly indicates the microstructure
of the evenly distributed particles of the sub-micron size (Figures 5 and 6). In addition, the volume fraction of phase-separated domains
increases as the BR content increases. The average particle diameter
of the BR domain increased with BR concentration: 10%A-HEX-2 (195
nm), 15%A-HEX-2 (207 nm), 20%A-HEX-2 (315 nm), and 25%A-HEX-2 (332
nm). However, the average particles diameter of BR domain was not
affected much by the functionality on the BR: 20%A-HEX-1 (310 nm),
20%A-HEX-2 (315 nm), and 20%A-HEX-3 (308 nm). The area of rubbery
domains for all of the compositions was found to be less than the
added volume fraction (vol %) of BR. The samples 10%HEX-2 (11.0 vol
%), 15%HEX-2 (16.5 vol %), 20%HEX-2 (21.4 vol %), and 25%HEX-2 (27.3
vol %) have rubbery domains of 4.4, 5.2, 9.7, and 19.4%, respectively,
which is less than the corresponding volume fractions of BR in the
resin system. The difference was smaller for the high-volume-fraction
BR samples compared with the low-volume-fraction samples. These results
indicate that there is BR in the primary phase that should reduce
the Tg and modulus of the primary phase
relative to the untoughened epoxy–anhydride resin.

As
per Tables 2 and 3, all of the compositions using BR exhibited a higher
fracture toughness than the neat Epon 828. Thus, there is a clear
correlation between the 2nd phase morphology and the fracture toughness
measured (Tables 2 and 3). These dispersed particles likely played a key
role as the center of dissipation of mechanical energy through shear
yielding.5,44 Therefore, it can also be concluded that
the neat ESO in Epon 828 resin systems had a lower toughness because
they did not exhibit phase separation. These results indicate that
the BR molecular structure creates a larger driving force for phase
separation versus ESO. From a thermodynamic point of view, as described
often by the Flory–Huggins relation, the increase in phase
separation could be due to both and increase in unfavorable enthalpic
interactions between the BR and epoxy resulting from the addition
of more aliphatic chains to the BR (higher χ) and reduction
in the entropy of mixing due to the higher molecular weight.50 It should be noted that the degree of phase
separation is also probably influenced by significant diffusion limitations
linked to the reaction and resulting gelation, and vitrification that
kinetically trap structures at a smaller size.

The anhydride-curing
molecule on the interface in the primary and
secondary phases could react with both the epoxy groups of the Epon
828 resin and the unreacted epoxy groups of the ESO and BR and form
chemical bonds between the rigid matrix and the rubbery particles.
Another factor in the phase separation behavior is likely that the
ESO has too many reactive functionalities, which cause a significant
reaction with the growing polymers that prevent aggregation of the
ESO into sizeable domains. This could be tested with the use of epoxidized
plant oils with a lower degree of epoxidation similar to that of A-HEX-1
to assess whether it is simply a reaction effect or also a molecular-weight
effect. We suspect that both factors affect the phase separation behavior.
Note, nonepoxidized plant oils phase separate on a much larger scale
and generally form polymers with a high content of the unreacted resin
(the plant oils) on the surface. The plant oil is thus excluded from
the network because it cannot react into the network. Thus, the reactive
functionality is necessary to ensure compatibility of the BR with
the network and limit the 2nd phase domain size.

AFM is an excellent
technique for observing the micron and sub-micron
domains in polymer networks. Morphology of the BR-toughened epoxy
samples was evaluated using AFM on the fracture surfaces of the samples
(Figure 7). The craterlike
architectures are observed in the three-dimensional AFM images of
the fracture surface. These craters result from the rubbery particles
being pulled out or breaking apart from the matrix in which particle
residuals can be clearly observed as a hole. Small deformation of
the matrix was observed near the holes. Such a deformation occurs
due to the optimal bonding between the BR particles and the adjacent
matrix.51 The collected images revealed
that the BR particles size increased with increase in the content
of BR in the epoxy matrix.

Figure 8 shows the
Derjaguin–Muller–Toropov modulus map of samples via
AFM.52 There are two distinct phases showing
different Derjaguin–Muller–Toropov moduli, with the
holes/2nd phase domain having significantly lower modulus values.
It is expected that the BR would have a much lower modulus than the
Epon 828 resin itself based on its aliphatic chemical structure and
the reduction in modulus and glass transition temperature observed
in Tables 2 and 3. Thus, we can conclude that the BR are phase separating
into these smaller domains. These modulus values are relative,52 so it would be difficult to directly correlate
them with the actual modulus properties of materials. However, such
maps can be successfully used to identify and characterize the composition
of multiphase materials.

3 Conclusions
The ESO-based BR epoxy
toughening agent was prepared via one-step
chemical modification of ESO with hexanoic anhydrides. The BR were
incorporated into epoxy Epon 828-based matrices and cured with anhydride
hardeners. A two-phase thermosetting network was developed that consisted
of a rigid Epon 828 matrix and evenly distributed small rubbery particles
of BR. The fracture toughness and the critical energy release rate
of the anhydride-cured epoxy were greatly improved with the addition
of BR with only a small reduction in Tg. In particular, the sample 20%A-HEX-2–80%Epon 828-EC had
the highest fracture toughness (KIc =
1.41 ± 0.18 MPa m1/2) and energy release rate (GIc = 1.15 ± 0.29 kJ/m2), which
was improved by >200 and >500%, respectively, compared with
100% for
Epon 828 cured with anhydride with only a 20 °C reduction in Tg. The morphology of the anhydride-cured Epon
828/BR confirmed that the improvement in both the impact strength
and the fracture toughness was the result of the phase separation
of the BR into rubbery domains. These systems could be useful for
high-performance resins and composites applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Drapex
6.8, supplied by
Galata Chemicals from Louisiana, was the ESO used. The EEW of ESO
(250 g/equiv) is listed in Table 1. Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate, dimethyl benzyl
amine, and hexanoic anhydride (97%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich,
whereas sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate were obtained from
Fisher Scientific, and used as received. Epon 828 (epoxy equivalent
weight, EEW 185–192 g/equiv. Hexion technical data sheet of
Epon 828 issued September 2005) and EPON1001F (EEW 525–550
g/equiv. Hexion technical data sheet of EPON1001F issued September
2005) epoxy resins, containing diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A and
oligomers were purchased from Miller Stephenson. Methylhexahydrophthalic
anhydride (MHHPA) and ECA100NC curing agent were obtained from Dixie
Chemical, Pasadena, TX. ECA100NC curing agent is composed of three
different anhydride molecules hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA >
10%), MHHPA, and methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride. The same batch
of ECA100NC was used for all of the experiments to prevent batch-to-batch
variation in the results described in this work. The molecular structures
of various key molecules used in this work are shown in Figure 1. The anhydride equivalent
weight of the anhydrides were provided by the manufacturer (epoxy
curing agent ECA100NC and MHHP technical data sheet, Dixie Chemical):
165 g/equiv for ECA100NC and 168 g/equiv for MHHPA.

4.2 Fatty Anhydride-Modified ESO (Bio-Rubber)
The modification
of ESO to prepare the BR tougheners was carried
out via acylation reaction (Scheme 1).37 The ESO modified with
1, 2, and 3 equivalents of hexanoic anhydride were named A-HEX-1,
A-HEX-2, and A-HEX-3, respectively. A-HEX-1 was prepared by adding
12.5 g of ESO (50 mmol of epoxy groups) and 2.678 g of hexanoic anhydride
(12.5 mmol, 4:1 mol equiv) in 100 mL of dichloromethane to a 250 mL
round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser. The catalyst boron trifluoride
etherate (0.125 g, 0.95 mmol) was charged via syringe into the mixture
and the reaction was allowed to stir for 3 h under inert (N2) condition.
After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was washed
3–4 times each with 100 mL of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution
and 100 mL of sodium chloride solution. The reaction solution was
dried over MgSO4 overnight. The solvent dichloromethane
was evaporated by rotary evaporation at 30 °C in vacuum. A-HEX-2
and A-HEX-3 were also prepared with 2 and 3 equivalents, respectively,
of hexanoic anhydride, following the procedure mentioned above. The
yield was 80–85% for all the bio-rubbers systems.

4.3 Monomer Characterization
Epoxy titration
was carried out on the Epon 828 resins and the BR using ASTM D1652-90,
Procedure B. FTIR (Mid-IR) was used to track the functional groups
of these BR tougheners on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 870 FTIR spectrometer
in the absorbance mode with 32 scans and an 8 cm–1 resolution in 650–4000 cm–1 range at 25
°C temperature using a deuterated tryglycine sulfate detector.
The viscosity of the BR was measured using an AR2000 ex rheometer
(TA Instruments) with a 40 mm flat-plate configuration using a shear
rate range from 0.01 to 1000 s–1 at 25 °C temperature.
Viscosity was reported as the average of three to four measurements
at a shear rate of 1000 s–1.

4.4 Fabrication
of the Epon 828 and BR Blends
The blends of Epon 828 and
BR were prepared with different weight
ratios (10, 15, 20, and 25%) of ESO (control samples) and BR with
a 0.9 mol ratio (recommended by supplier Dixie Chemical) of anhydride
hardeners ECA100NC and MHHPA to epoxy groups. Note, stoichiometry
was based on the measured epoxy equivalent weights of the Epon 828
and BR systems via epoxy titration, ASTM D1652-90. Dimethyl benzyl
amine catalyst was used at 2 wt %. The epoxy resin (Epon 828) and
BR were mixed using a THINKY planetary mixer (1800 rpm for 3 min)
and further 0.9 mol ratio of anhydride hardeners (ECA100NC and MHHPA)
and catalyst were subsequently mixed following a similar mixing condition.
The homogeneous mixture of resins was poured into rubber molds and
cured at 90 °C for 9 h and postcured at 200 °C for 9 h.

Other compositions were prepared to verify the impact of BR on a
high-molecular-weight epoxy system. EPON1001F (15 wt %) and 20 wt
% of BR was incorporated in Epon 828 and cured with ECA100NC and MHHPA.
To prepare the blends, 15 wt % of EPON1001F was added to the Epon
828 and heated at 80 °C for 6 h, and the solution was hand mixed
until it was homogeneous. BR (20 wt %) was added and cured with ECA100NC
and MHHPA following the above mixing and curing methods. The samples
were designated by a short-hand notation that gives the wt % of the
other epoxy components, including the BR components, added to Epon
828 and suffixed by the anhydride used with “EC” for
ECA100NC and “MHHPA” for methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride.
The various formulations prepared are detailed in Tables 2 and 3.

4.5 Polymer Characterization
All of the
samples were characterized by near-infrared (n-IR) both pre- and postcure
to determine the extent of cure of the resins. Within the limits of
FTIR spectroscopy, all of the resins were over 99% cured. The n-IR
measurements were obtained in the range of 4000–8000 cm–1 at room temperature on a Thermo Nicolet Nexus 870
FTIR spectrometer in a dry air atmosphere (32 scans, 8 cm–1 resolution, transmission mode). All of the cured epoxy samples were
sanded to a standard size and shape (nominally 38 mm × 9 mm ×
4 mm) and tested to obtain Tg and modulus
in a TA Instruments Q800 dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). A single-cantilever
clamp configuration was used at 1 Hz with a 10 μm deflection
and a temperature ramp rate of 2 °C/min from 25 to 200 °C.
For the SEM analysis, the samples were fractured at room temperature,
and the fractured surfaces of cured epoxy samples were coated with
platinum using a Cressington sputter coater at 40 mA for 30 s, coating
to an expected thickness of 7–9 nm. The images were taken with
an FEI XL30 ESEM and a Zeiss Supra 50VP SEM. The average particle
diameter and domain area of BR were calculated using the ImageJ software.
The AFM images were acquired using a Bruker Dimension Icon AFM equipped
with a tapping mode. The critical strain energy release rate (GIc) and critical stress intensity factor (KIc) values of samples were measured at 25 °C
using a servo-hydraulic INSTRON model 8872 apparatus following ASTM
D5045-99, method E 399. The GIc was calculated
by KIc using the storage modulus values.
Five to seven compact tension specimens with a dimension of 16 mm
× 13 mm × 5.5 mm were prepared and tested for each composition.
A sharp precrack was introduced at the bottom of 8 mm notch of the
each sample before testing with a 1.0 mm/min crosshead speed. The
density of cured Epon 828 (1.2038 g/cm3) and ESO (1.0739
g/cm3) with ECA100NC was measured via a density gradient
column as described in ASTM D1505. The density of ESO cured with ECA100NC
was taken as an estimated density for BR to calculate the volume fraction
of BR in the resin system.
