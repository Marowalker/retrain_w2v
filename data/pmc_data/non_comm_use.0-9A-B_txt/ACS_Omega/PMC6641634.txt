A H2O2-induced degradation mechanism is presented
for the hydrated Nafion membrane proceeding through the dissociation
of the ether linkages of the side chains. Although the durability
of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells clearly depends on the degradation
rate of the membrane, typically Nafion, the degradation mechanism
still has not been resolved. It has often been assumed that the principal
mode of degradation involves OH• radicals; in contrast,
we show here that a H2O2-induced degradation
mechanism is more likely. On the basis of state-of-the-art theoretical
calculations and detailed comparison with experimental results, we
present such a mechanism for the hydrated Nafion membrane, proceeding
through the dissociation of the ether linkage of the side chains,
with a relatively low activation energy. In this mechanism, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H (λ is the hydration number)
is obtained as a key degradation fragment. Possible subsequent decomposition-reaction
mechanisms are also elucidated for this fragment. The calculated vibrational
spectra for the intermediates and products proposed in these mechanisms
were found to be consistent with the experimental IR spectra. Further
consideration of this H2O2-mediated degradation
mechanism could greatly facilitate the search for ways to combat membrane
degradation.

Introduction
Degradation of proton-exchange electrolyte
membranes is the most
serious problem in fuel-cell operations, determining the durability
of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).1,2 Proton-exchange
membranes in PEMFCs conduct protons produced from the oxidation of
hydrogen gas on the anode to a catalyst composed of, for example,
Pt alloy on the cathode for oxygen-reduction reactions (ORR) to proceed.
Under PEMFC operating conditions, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced to some extent and degrades the proton-exchange
membrane, deteriorating the proton conductivity of the membrane.3 Experiments have shown that the H2O2 production of PEMFC results from O2 crossover
in proton-exchange membranes.4−6 That is, oxygen (O2) gas injected at the cathode permeates to the anode and then reacts
with hydrogen radicals on the anode to produce H2O2. A rotating ring-disk measurement study clearly shows that
H2O2 is formed by the reaction of O2 and H2 adsorbing on Pt surface at low potentials; especially
on Pt(111), 100% H2O2 formation is observed.7 This reaction is so facile that it is useful
even as a H2O2 synthesis method.8 Nevertheless, the OH radical has usually been assumed to
be the reactive species in the degradation of proton-exchange membranes.
Fenton test studies, however, have raised questions concerning this
assumption.9,10 In the Fenton test, the reaction
of H2O2 and Fe2+ ions has been interpreted
to provide OH radicals as the active intermediate:11,12 H2O2 + Fe2+ → OH• + OH– + Fe3+, although several theoretical
studies support another hypothesis13 that
FeO2+ ion is the most likely active intermediate: H2O2 + Fe2+ → H2O +
FeO2+.14,15 On the basis of a Fenton test
of a Nafion membrane, which is the most widely used proton-exchange
membrane, Kinumoto et al. found that the degradation proceeded in
30% H2O2 solution at 80 °C and the decomposition
ratios of SO42– groups and C–F bonds were inconsistent with those obtained
in the absence of the Fenton reagent in the PEMFC:9 the ratios were 33 and 68% for SO42– groups and C–F bonds
after 9 days in the Fenton test, and 7 and 1% after 5.5 days under
the PEMFC operating conditions, respectively. Using gas-phase H2O2 exposure, Hommura et al. found that the rate
of COOH formation does not approach zero as Fe2+ concentration
decreases and confirmed, on the basis of the chemical kinetics, that
Nafion is decomposed by H2O2 alone, that is,
without metal ions.10 IR spectral analyses
also showed that after the Fenton test, Nafion exhibited peaks around
900 and 1600 cm–1, which were not found in the IR
spectra of the decomposed Nafion under PEMFC operating conditions.16 The instability of the OH radical in aquo has
also been hardly taken into account in conventional studies. The lifetime
of OH radicals is 100 ns in aquo, which is too short to cause degradation
over a wide region in the proton-conducting channels, where water
clusters are present predominantly near the sulfonic acid groups.
The large dissociation energy of the OH radical on the Pt surface
is also an obstacle for the OH-radical-induced degradation: Under
a H2-rich H2/O2/H2O mixed
gas, the dissociation of the OH radical from the Pt surface requires
more than 40 kcal/mol even at very high temperature (around 1000 K).17 We note, however, that the degradation can indeed
be caused by radicals such as OH• when metal ions
are supplied from the end plate of the PEMFC18 and can be inhibited by adding radical scavengers like cerium dioxide
(CeO2) nanoparticles.19 It is,
therefore, reasonable to consider that the degradation of proton-exchange
membranes proceeds through two reactions, H2O2-induced and OH-radical-induced reactions, depending on the surrounding
environment, such as humidity conditions, the distance from the catalyst
layer, and the presence of metal ions.

The degradation mechanism
of the Nafion membrane has also been
vigorously investigated.1,3−6,16,20−33 Aoki et al. and other groups revealed that the degradation mainly
proceeds near the anode as a result of O2 crossover.3−6 Endoh et al. and other groups reported that the degradation rate
increased as the relative humidity decreased.21−23 Ghassemzadeh
et al. revealed that the degradation proceeds only in the presence
of a Pt catalyst in addition to H2 and O2 and
that it is hardly affected by the morphology of the Nafion membrane.24 Various studies have also been reported on the
degradation fragment species. Deng et al. showed that hydrogen fluoride
(HF)- and CF2-containing fragments were produced.25 LaConti et al. also reported that the degradation
produces F– ion, CO2, and low-molecular-weight
perfluorocarbon sulfonic acids.1 As another
possible degradation product, several studies have suggested the perfluoro(3-oxa-5-methyl)pentane-1-sulfonic-5-carboxylic
diacid (HOOC–CF(CF2)–O–CF2CF2–SO3H),26−29 implying the degradation through
the ether-linkage dissociation of the side chains, although the identification
of this compound is not completely certain, as discussed later. Akiyama
et al. also supported the formation of a carboxylic acid by showing
that the most remarkable difference in the IR spectra of Nafion before
and after the degradation was the appearance of the peaks assigned
to the vibrational modes of carboxylic acid groups.16 There have also been several theoretical studies focusing
on the degradation of the Nafion membrane. Assuming that the degradation
takes place at the weakest bonds, Okamoto suggested that the C–S
bond of the side chain is the most reactive part.30 Coms calculated decomposition-reaction enthalpies and suggested
that only the OH radical is able to abstract a H atom from a carboxylic
acid to unzip the main chain of Nafion.34 Yu et al. have recently explored various radical-induced degradation
processes for the end groups of both the main and side chains, assuming
that the reactive species are radicals coming from the ORR, such as
the OH radical.31,32 It is important to note, however,
that hydration water clusters attached to the sulfonic acid groups
have not been included in their calculation models, although they
must certainly be present for protons to be conducted within the membranes.
Despite many experimental and theoretical studies on this topic, the
degradation mechanism of the Nafion membrane has never been confirmed,
as far as we know. It is, therefore, meaningful to theoretically reveal
the degradation mechanism of the Nafion membrane using realistic calculation
models, considering, for example, the hydration structures of the
membrane and H2O2.

Proton conduction and
hydration structures of Nafion membrane have
been investigated from various aspects, both experimentally and theoretically.
It has been accepted that the proton conduction in aquo proceeds through
the de Grotthuss35 and vehicle mechanisms.36 In the de Grotthuss mechanism, protons transfer
at high speed using hydrogen-bond networks through the Zundel cation
H5O2+ complex, that is, the [H2O··H··OH2]+ complex.37,38 Because of the very low reaction barrier height of about 2 kcal/mol,
the de Grotthuss mechanism has been assumed in past theoretical studies
on proton conduction39 and proton dissociation40 in the Nafion membrane. Experiments, however,
have shown that Nafion contains a number of unconnected hydrogen-bond
networks under low-humidity conditions despite its high proton conductivity.41,42 Protons in low-humidity Nafion are, therefore, considered to transfer
not only by the de Grotthuss mechanism but also by the vehicle mechanism.
In the vehicle mechanism, protonated water molecules diffuse to deliver
protons. This implies that proton conduction requires the dissociation
of protonated water molecules at low humidity. Theoretical calculations,
however, show that protonated water clusters require very large energies
to dissociate from the sulfonic acid groups of Nafion at low humidity
(about 100 kcal/mol).43 As an alternative
mechanism, we have suggested a relay mechanism to explain the proton
conduction between the unconnected hydrogen-bond networks in the low-humidity
Nafion membrane.43 In the relay mechanism,
proton conduction proceeds through the relay of protonated water clusters
from one sulfonic acid group to another using the long side chains
of Nafion. As this mechanism requires only about 30 kcal/mol to dissociate
protonated water clusters, it is considered to proceed even at room
temperature. We note that this relay mechanism involves doubly hydrated
structures of the Nafion membrane. Through a detailed comparison of
experimental and theoretical results, we have recently revealed that
the sulfonic acid groups of Nafion are doubly hydrated, regardless
of humidity conditions.44 Comparing the
experimental humidity dependence of the IR spectrum of the Nafion
membrane under PEMFC operating conditions and the theoretical hydration
number dependence of the vibrational spectrum of the hydrated Nafion
membrane model, we found that the theoretical spectral dependence
is consistent with the experimental one only for a doubly hydrated
Nafion model optimized using an initial structure, in which protons
are detached from the sulfonic acid groups. This result strongly supports
the proton conduction through the relay mechanism under the low-humidity
condition and the doubly hydrated Nafion membrane structure, regardless
of the humidity.

In this study, we theoretically reveal the
degradation mechanism
of the hydrated Nafion electrolyte membrane in a PEMFC, focusing on
the H2O2-induced degradation and subsequent
reactions of the degradation fragment molecule. After detailing the
computational methods, we first elucidate the H2O2-induced degradation mechanism of the doubly hydrated Nafion membrane.
Then, we verify the decomposed hydrated Nafion membrane and the degradation
fragment molecule by comparing the calculated vibrational spectra
with the experimental IR spectrum results. We finally investigate
the subsequent reaction processes of the degradation fragment molecule.

Computational
Details
All calculations have been performed for the doubly
hydrated structures
of Nafion membrane molecular model, in which water molecules are explicitly
hydrated, using the long-range correction45 of Becke 1988 exchange46 plus the Lee–Yang–Parr
correlation47 (LC-BLYP) functional (the
only parameter μ = 0.4748) with the
cc-pVDZ basis set.49,50 We have adopted the double-unit
model of hydrated Nafion membrane shown in Figure 1a. Geometry optimizations of the hydrated
Nafion structures have been carried out for several initial structures
maximizing the number of the hydrogen bonds. For the calculated hydrated
Nafion model, we have used the doubly hydrated structures (Figure 1) following our previous
study based on the experimental and theoretical IR spectral analyses
of hydrated Nafion.44 In Figure 2, the optimum geometries of
the doubly hydrated double-unit Nafion membrane model with H2O2 molecule are illustrated for the hydration numbers
per sulfonic acid group: λ = 1–4, which models the low-humidity
conditions near the anode.51,52 It is important to
note that as shown in this figure, protonated water molecules are
dissociated only for λ = 3 and 4, whereas they attach the sulfonic
acid group for λ = 1 and 2. This is consistent with conventional
theoretical results.43 Using these optimum
geometries as the initial structures, we have optimized the geometries
of the hydrated Nafion + H2O2 models by extending
the C–O ether-linkage distance (Figure 1) from 1.2 to 4.0 Å. Protons are assumed
to be dissociated to model proton transfers in the relay mechanism.43,44 The Gaussian 09 suite of program53 has
been used to perform all of the LC-BLYP calculations. All of the optimized
structures have been checked to ensure that they yield positive, real
frequencies. Transition-state calculations have been performed by
the quadratic synchronous transit method.54,55 The predictor–corrector integrator method56,57 was used to calculate the intrinsic reaction coordinates of the
reactions. The vibrational modes contributing to IR spectra and their
assignments were analyzed using GaussView 5.0.8.58

Calculated Results and Discussions
H2O2-Induced Degradation Mechanism of
Nafion Membrane
Following the experimental studies on the
degradation mechanism of hydrated Nafion membrane mentioned above,
we imposed the following assumptions to the calculation model:1. The degradation of
Nafion membrane
takes place in the vicinity of the anode. This is because the anode
side of the membrane undergoes severer degradation than the cathode
side.1,24 The hydration numbers of the sulfonic acid
groups, therefore, should be relatively small to model the hydration
conditions near the anode.51,52

2. The sulfonic acid groups are doubly
hydrated in the hydrated Nafion. As mentioned above, our previous
IR spectroscopy study proves that Nafion has a doubly hydrated structure,
regardless of the humidity conditions.44

3. The degradation initially
proceeds
with the ether-linkage dissociation of the side chains. Several experimental
studies have suggested a carboxylic acid in the degradation fragment
species, which is considered to originate from the ether-linkage dissociation.26−29

4. The morphology of
the hydrated Nafion
membrane has negligible effect on the degradation mechanism, although
the morphology depends on the hydration number.59 This is because an 19F NMR experiment showed
that the morphology of the Nafion membrane hardly affects the degradation
ratio.24

On the basis
of these assumptions, we have explored the degradation
mechanism of the hydrated Nafion membrane.

As a result, we succeeded
in elucidating a H2O2-induced degradation mechanism
of the hydrated Nafion membrane. Figure 3 displays the hydrated Nafion model before
and after the H2O2-induced decomposition for
the hydration number of λ = 4. As shown in the figure, H2O2, which participates in a hydrogen-bond network
with the hydration water cluster of the sulfonic acid groups, decomposes
the ether linkages, forming an alcohol group and an −O–OH
group. That is, the H2O2-induced decomposition
is expressed in the following scheme:

Figure 3 Optimized
structures of hydrated Nafion membrane model (a) before
and (b) after degradation, with the close-up view of dissociated C–O
bond. Geometries are optimized by LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ method. The dissociated
ether C–O bond is indicated by blue dotted circles and H2O2 and the −OH and −O–OH groups
after decomposition are indicated by green dotted circles. “Rp” in the chemical formula represents the residual part
of the Nafion membrane model.

We should emphasize that this reaction path is obtained by
simply
extending the ether C–O bond of the hydrated Nafion membrane
with the H2O2 molecule. This indicates that
the ether linkage is directly cleaved by H2O2 without producing OH radicals. Although this scheme has the appearance
of being unlikely because of the unfamiliar −O–OH group
produced, it is interesting to note that this scheme is analogous
to the double-bond cleavage mechanism by ozone:

Similar mechanisms are also suggested for decompositions after
TiO2 photocatalytic reactions.60 It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose that the −O–O–
bond is not uncommon in the process of bond cleavages in gas phase.

Figure 4 illustrates
the potential energy curves of the H2O2-induced
ether-linkage dissociation of the doubly hydrated Nafion membrane
for λ = 1–4 in terms of the C–O bond distance
of the ether linkage. The figure shows that the reaction barrier heights
are moderate, 32–40 kcal/mol, nearly independent of hydration
number. This indicates that the ether-linkage dissociation reaction
proceeds irrespective of the humidity of the membrane, without any
other reactive species, such as radicals. On the other hand, the reaction
energies decrease from λ = 1 to 2 but then gradually increase
from λ = 2 to 4: 20.4, 15.1, 19.4, and 25.7 kcal/mol for λ
= 1–4, respectively. This result seems inconsistent with the
experimental results showing that the degradation ratio increases
with decreasing humidity.21−23 This inconsistency is explained
by the decrease of O2 crossover and O2 adsorption
as well as the instability of OH radicals in aquo. The increase of
humidity leads to the obstruction of the membrane channels by water,
decreasing the O2 crossover, which causes the degradation.3−6 It is also known that water molecules prevent O2 adsorption
on the electrode surface. Therefore, the increase of humidity suppresses
H2O2 production and consequently slows the degradation.
The increasing humidity also destabilizes OH radicals, which are reactive
species in other degradation mechanisms; therefore, it may reduce
the infiltration of OH radicals into the internal region of the membrane.
The calculated potential energy curves suggest that the H2O2-induced degradation reaction of the ether linkages
naturally proceeds irrespective of the water volume of the Nafion
membrane channels. Because H2O2 is incorporated
in the hydrogen-bond networks of water clusters, this result is consistent
with the experimental results showing that the degradation progresses
deeply into the interior of the membrane.1

Figure 4 Potential
energy curves of ether-linkage dissociation reaction
with reference to the energy of the reactant in terms of the dissociated
C–O bond distance for λ = 1–4. Geometries are
calculated by LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ method. Chemical structures of reactant,
transition state (TS), and product are also shown.

In Figure 4, the
dependence of the barrier heights on the hydration number, that is,
λ = 2 > 1 > 4 > 3, seems unreasonable. However, this
dependence
can be interpreted by considering the proton-dissociation nature of
the Nafion membrane. As shown in Figure 2, the proton is dissociated from the sulfonic
acid group at λ = 3. On the basis of this barrier height dependence,
we, therefore, suppose that the presence of the dissociated proton
may support the ether-linkage dissociation by decreasing the barrier
heights. This support may be attenuated by increasing the hydration
number. This hydration number dependence of the barrier heights suggests
that this ether-bond dissociation proceeds under low-humidity condition
around λ = 3.

How likely is the H2O2-induced degradation
compared to the OH-induced degradation? In the OH-induced degradation
mechanism, the formation of OH radicals on the electrode catalyst
surface has been taken as the rate-determining step. Yu et al. theoretically
found the following reaction path for the OH-radical formation on
the Pt(111) surface:31 1  Because of the lower reaction barrier (18
kcal/mol), this reaction seems to proceed in preference to the H2O2-induced degradation because of its higher reaction
barrier (30–40 kcal/mol). We note, however, that reaction 1 is endothermic, with a reaction
energy of −17 kcal/mol, and has another similar low-barrier
exothermic reaction path (reaction barrier is 10 kcal/mol and reaction
energy is 30 kcal/mol) 2  In this reaction, OH radicals need to desorb
to become reactive species. The adsorption energy of the OH radical
is evaluated as 48 kcal/mol,31 which is
much higher than the reaction barrier of the H2O2-induced degradation. This process is supposed to be the rate-determining
step of the OH-radical-induced mechanism. It is important to note,
also, that in the vicinity of the electrode surface, there are hydration
water clusters, to which adsorbed molecules, such as H2O2, are hydrated. It is theoretically revealed that OH
radicals have no stable structures in water and therefore these radicals
react spontaneously with each other, with no reaction barrier, when
the surrounding water molecules are explicitly incorporated. That
is, when there are vicinal water clusters, OH radicals are converted
back to H2O2 in reactions 1 and 2. This indicates
that OH radicals need to avoid vicinal water clusters to be reactive
species. However, we would emphasize that this does not disprove the
OH-radical-induced degradation. In the presence of metal ions, such
as Fe2+ ions, experimental studies have observed that OH
radicals are formed with a very low activation energy, as mentioned
above. We, therefore, conclude that the H2O2-induced degradation proceeds together with the OH-induced degradation.

Vibrational Spectra of Decomposed Hydrated Nafion Membrane
Next, let us compare the vibrational spectra of the decomposed
hydrated Nafion membrane and degradation fragment molecule, that is,
(H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H, with the experimental
IR spectra of decomposed hydrated Nafion membrane and its degradation
fragment species to discuss the reliability of the H2O2-induced degradation mechanism. Akiyama et al. observed the
IR spectra of the fragment species and decomposed Nafion membrane
in aquo.16 The experimental IR spectra
show that the degradation generates sharp peaks around 1700 cm–1 and wide peaks around 2300 and 3300 cm–1 and that the Fenton test, producing OH radicals, results in various
IR peaks around 900 and 1600 cm–1 compared to those
of decomposed hydrated Nafion membrane. Comparing the calculated vibrational
spectra of the hydrated Nafion before and after degradation with the
experimental IR spectra, we can, therefore, test the decomposed Nafion
membrane and degradation fragment molecule.

Figure 5 displays the calculated IR
spectra of hydrated Nafion before and after degradation for λ
= 1–4. As shown in the figure, strong peaks appear around 2000,
2400, and 3000–3700 cm–1 after the degradation.
On the other hand, the degradation slightly changes the peaks in the
wavelength region below 1700 cm–1. We note that
the experimental IR spectra of the degradation fragment species also
show strong peaks in the wavelength regions of 1700–2000, 2200–2400,
and 3000–3700 cm–1, slightly affecting the
peak strengths for the wavelength region below 1700 cm–1.16 This consistency strongly supports
the H2O2-induced ether-linkage dissociation
mechanism. This also suggests that the main degradation fragment molecule
is (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H, not containing
a carboxylic acid group −COOH but a hydroperoxyl group −O–OH.
Although this degradation fragment molecule is considered to be converted
to the carboxylic acid, it seems chemically stable due to its poor
reactivity, as shown above. On the basis of the vibrational spectra,
we propose that (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H is one of
the main degradation fragment molecules and that several byproducts
are derived from the subsequent reactions of this molecule.

Figure 5 Vibrational
spectra of decomposed hydrated Nafion membrane model
before and after degradation in the wavenumber region of 0–4000
cm–1 for λ = 1–4, which are calculated
by LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ method.

What types of vibrational modes do the peaks appearing after
the
degradation of hydrated Nafion membrane correspond to? Table 1 displays the theoretical peak
assignments of the IR spectra of hydrated Nafion membrane before and
after the H2O2-induced ether-linkage dissociation
for λ = 4. The table clearly indicates that the strong peaks
appearing around 2000, 2400, and 3000–3700 cm–1 after the degradation correspond to the OH stretching modes of the
hydroperoxyl and alcohol groups formed after the ether-linkage dissociation
and the accompanying OH stretching modes of water molecules around
these groups. We note that the peaks corresponding to the vibrations
of the hydroperoxyl group appear at 831, 1015, and 1060 cm–1. As shown in Figure 5, these peaks are hidden behind other peaks in the calculated IR
spectra. Interestingly, these peaks are, however, visible in the experimental
IR spectra of the decomposed Nafion membrane.16 It is also interesting to note that the high peaks assigned to the
OH-bond stretching of H2O2 appear at 3553 and
3700 cm–1 for the predecomposed Nafion. The IR absorption
of these peaks supports the H2O2-induced dissociation
because the OH stretching of H2O2 determines
the reactivity of this dissociation. The assignment of the vibrational
spectral peaks, therefore, also supports the H2O2-induced ether-linkage dissociation.

to the predecomposed Nafion membrane. Only the peaks with strength
higher than 10–38 esu2 cm2 are listed. The peak assignments corresponding to the vibrations
of H2O2 in the predecomposed Nafion and −OH
and −O–OH groups in the decomposed Nafion are underlined.

The degradation fragment molecule
can be explored in further detail
on the basis of the vibrational spectra. Akiyama et al. also observed
the IR spectrum of the degradation fragment species dried in vacuum.
In the experimental IR spectrum, strong peaks appeared around 1700,
2500, and 3500 cm–1 after the degradation. Figure 6 illustrates the
calculated vibrational spectra of the hydrated degradation fragment
molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H, for various
λ values. As shown in the figure, the peaks corresponding to
the strong peaks of the experimental IR spectrum are assigned to the
vibrational modes of the degradation fragment molecule for different
hydration numbers. This result suggests that the degradation fragment
molecule can exist simultaneously with different numbers of hydration
water molecules. Because the experimental IR spectrum is given for
the dried species in vacuum, this also indicates that hydration water
molecules strongly bind to the sulfonic acid groups of the Nafion
membrane. This result also supports the conclusion of our previous
study that the proton conduction proceeds through the relay mechanism
in Nafion under low-humidity conditions due to the very high hydration
energy of the sulfonic acid groups.43 We,
therefore, propose that the degradation fragment molecule is strongly
hydrated, even under dry conditions.

fragment molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H,

cm–1 for λ = 1–4, which are calculated
by LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ method.

Subsequent Decomposition Reactions of the Degradation Fragment
Molecule
For comparative verification with the experimental
results, it is meaningful to consider the subsequent decomposition
reactions of the presumed main degradation fragment molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H. Several past studies have suggested
that HO3S–CF2–CF2–O–CF(CF3)–COOH, called “molecule A”, is the main
degradation product.10,29,61 Molecule A is similar to the present degradation fragment molecule
in that both of them are derived from the ether-linkage dissociation
of the side chain of Nafion membrane. Actually, a similar molecule,
HO3S–CF2–CF2–O–CF(CF3)–CF2–O–OH, is considered
to be formed by the present decomposition mechanism, although it is
different from molecule A, including the end −CF2–O–OH group instead of the −COOH group. Although
molecule A was assigned on the basis of 19F NMR and IR
spectral analyses,16,61 this assignment prompts several
questions: The 19F NMR spectrum was not observed after
a PEMFC degradation but after a Fenton test, and the IR spectrum also
supports the present degradation fragment molecule, as mentioned above.
What we need to confirm the presumed main degradation fragment molecule
is, however, not to rule out the existence of molecule A but to elucidate
how experimentally found decomposition byproducts are formed from
this molecule. It is, therefore, meaningful to explore the subsequent
decomposition-reaction mechanisms of the presumed main degradation
fragment molecule.

As a result, we found two probable monomolecular
decomposition reactions of the degradation fragment molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–OH 3   4  The potential energy curves of these reactions
on the intrinsic reaction coordinates are drawn in Figure 7. We note that despite both
these reactions are exothermic as mentioned later, they are considered
not to proceed without a catalyst, for example, Pt surface and metal
ions, under fuel-cell operating conditions, due to the very high barrier
heights.

Figure 7 Reaction potential energy curves of the main degradation fragment
molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H, on the
intrinsic reaction coordinate with the optimized structures of the
reactant, TS, and product, which are calculated by LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ
method: Decompositions to (a) SO2 and (b) FC-O-OH.

As shown in Figure 7(a), reaction 1 exothermically
produces sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is experimentally
found as a degradation product,33 for any
hydration number. Although SO2 is a gas at room temperature,
it is hydrated to produce sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is also experimentally found.33 The degradation fragment molecule of reaction 1, CF3–CFO––O–OH, appears to be unstable and therefore seems to
convert to a carboxylic acid. In many trial calculations, we, however,
found that no monomolecular decomposition reaction takes place without
artificial bond cleavage for this molecule. We, therefore, presume
that this molecule is also included in the residual species of the
degradation. The vibrational spectrum of this molecule provides intense
peaks for 1000–1700 and 3023 cm–1. By reference
to the experimental IR spectrum of dried dissolved species,16 such peaks were found to appear in these wavenumber
regions after the degradation. However, these intense peaks are hidden
in the vibrational spectrum of the main degradation fragment molecule
in Figure 6. This fragment
molecule is expected to be found in the 19F NMR spectrum
because it simply exhibits two peaks with 3:1 peak strengths. However,
we consider that this reaction requires a catalyst to proceed due
to the high barrier heights, which exceed 60 kcal/mol at least (λ
= 1).

The potential energy curves of reaction 2 appear to indicate that it does not proceed
due to the very high reaction barrier heights, 137.34, 139.52, 140.14,
140.83, 141.03, and 141.25 kcal/mol for λ = 0–5, respectively,
and the endothermic nature, with high, positive reaction energies,
50.74, 52.06, 51.24, 51.27, 48.31, and 46.27 kcal/mol. Following the
endothermic nature, we should note that FC–O–OH would
be too unstable to be present as a residual species. Figure 8 plots the potential energy
curve of the decomposition reaction of FC–O–OH. As shown
in the figure, FC–O–OH transforms into the carboxylic
acid FCOOH with a very large reaction energy (155.15 kcal/mol) and
then it is decomposed to HF and CO2, which are both experimentally
found in the degradation species,1,25 with relatively
low activation energies (30.68 kcal/mol at the maximum). Overall therefore, reaction 2 is very exothermic,
with a large reaction energy, which totals more than 100 kcal/mol.
We should, however, be reminded that this reaction requires a catalyst
to proceed due to the very high barrier heights. Let us then assume
that a catalyst supports this reaction. The degradation fragment molecule
of this reaction is (H2O)λHO3S–CF3, although this molecule has not yet been
experimentally assigned, as far as we know. However, it may be included
in the low-molecular-weight perfluorocarbon sulfonic acid in the degradation
species1 because the terminal products
of this reaction, HF and CO2, are experimentally detected.
The vibrational spectra of this molecule depend on the hydration number
for the maximum peak wavenumbers: 616, 2768, 2038, and 2526 cm–1 for λ = 0–3, respectively. As shown
in Figure 6, these
peaks are also hidden in the vibrational spectrum of the main degradation
fragment molecule except for the peak at 2038 cm–1 (λ = 2). Because the experimental IR spectrum of dried dissolved
species exhibits no peak around 2038 cm–1, this
may suggest that the λ value for (H2O)λHO3S–CF3 is very small (λ = 0
or 1) under dry conditions.

of FC–O–OH
to HF + CO2 on the intrinsic reaction coordinate, which
is calculated by LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ method. The intrinsic reaction coordinates
are normalized for each reaction step. The optimized structures of
local minimum (MIN) and TS points are also shown.

In summary, we propose that CF3–CFO––O–OH and (H2O)λHO3S–CF3 molecules are formed as stable
byproducts
in addition to the experimentally observed SO2, HF, and
CO2 molecules in the thermal decomposition of the main
degradation fragment molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H.
We expect that these degradation fragment molecules will be experimentally
found, for example, in the 19F NMR spectrum analysis.

Conclusions
In this study, we have theoretically investigated
the H2O2-induced degradation mechanism of doubly
hydrated Nafion
membrane in the PEMFC and its subsequent decomposition reactions focusing
on the ether-linkage dissociation of the side chain and thermodynamic
reactions. As a result, we have revealed the ether-linkage decomposition
mechanism by the H2O2 molecule, which is hydrated
in the protonated water cluster around the sulfonic acid group. We
have also found the decomposition reactions of the degradation fragment
molecule derived from the ether-linkage dissociation and have confirmed
that the expected products are consistent with conventional experimental
results.

On the basis of reasonable assumptions, we have calculated
the
potential energy curves of the ether-linkage dissociation of the doubly
hydrated Nafion membrane model with H2O2 molecule
in the hydration-protonated water cluster for various hydration numbers.
Consequently, we have found the decomposition-reaction pathways providing
relatively low reaction barriers of 32–40 kcal/mol, which are
analogous to the C–C double-bond cleavage mechanism by ozone.

We have compared the vibrational spectra of the resulting decomposed
Nafion membrane and degradation fragment molecule, (H2O)λHO3S–CF2–CF2–O–O–H. As a result, we have confirmed
that the vibrational spectra are consistent with the experimental
IR spectra of the decomposed hydrated Nafion membrane and degradation
fragment species, despite the fragment molecule having an unfamiliar
end group, −CF2–O–OH.

We have
also explored the subsequent reactions of the presumed
degradation fragment molecule for various hydration numbers. In consequence,
we have obtained two possible decomposition-reaction processes giving
CF3–CFO––O–OH and
(H2O)λHO3S–CF3 molecules as degradation byproducts in addition to the experimentally
observed SO2, HF, and CO2. However, we found
that these subsequent reactions would require a catalyst, such as
Pt surface or metal ions, to proceed, due to the high barrier heights.
We have also found that these byproducts are quite stable and would
not be expected to undergo subsequent monomolecular reactions and
therefore suggested that these byproducts should be contained in the
degradation species.

In conclusion, we have proposed a H2O2-induced
decomposition mechanism of Nafion membrane, which is likely to proceed
simultaneously with conventional OH-radical-induced mechanisms. The
schematic diagram of the decomposition mechanism is illustrated in Figure 9. We expect that
elucidating this decomposition mechanism will shed light on ways to
develop strategies to combat the degradation of proton-exchange membranes.
