Thermal
processing conditions, pH, and salt content affect the formation
of egg white ovalbumin amyloid, which was investigated using high-precision
measurements of ultrasonic velocity and attenuation. These were related
to fluorescence and particle size measurements. Fluorescence changes
indicated the formation of amyloid-like aggregates that was enhanced
by increasing time–temperature treatments. The ultrasonic velocity
of ovalbumin after heating at neutral pH (60 min at 70 or 80 °C)
was lower than that of unheated ovalbumin, whereas the attenuation
was higher. The decrease in the velocity represents increased compressibility
associated with a change in the compactness of the protein, whereas
changes in attenuation are due to protein conformational changes.
Heating ramp studies revealed transitions at approximately 58 and
73 °C. During heating at a constant temperature, the ultrasonic
velocity decreased slowly with increasing heating time, indicating
an increase in ovalbumin compressibility. It is suggested that the
obtained amyloid-like ovalbumin aggregates contain a compact core
surrounded by loosely packed protein segments.

==== Body
Introduction
The term amyloids originally referred
to filamentous protein deposits
in the human body, with structures that are linked to several diseases.1 However, several food proteins can also form
amyloid-like fibrils, such as lysozyme,2,3 ovalbumin,4,5 β-lactoglobulin,6,7 bovine serum albumin,8,9 α-lactalbumin,10,11 and soy glycinin.12,13 The molecular structure characterizing amyloid fibrils is the cross-β
motif consisting of β-strands that are stacked in the direction
perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril, linked by interstrand
hydrogen bonds.14 The presence of amyloid-like
aggregates is typically indicated by staining with dyes such as Congo
red or thioflavin T (ThT).1

The focus
of this work is the formation of amyloid-like aggregates
from ovalbumin. Ovalbumin, which constitutes about half of the proteins
in avian egg white, is a glycophosphoprotein with a molecular weight
of 45 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.5. The sequence of 385 amino
acids contains six cysteine residues, of which two are involved in
one disulfide bond and the rest occur as free sulfhydryl groups.15−17 The denaturation temperature of ovalbumin at neutral pH is about
78 °C. During storage and mild heating under alkaline conditions,
the more heat-stable S-ovalbumin with a denaturation temperature of
86 °C is formed from native ovalbumin.18,19

Amyloid-like aggregates can be formed from ovalbumin during
heating
under both acidic and neutral pH conditions.4,5 Process
conditions, ionic strength, and pH are typical parameters that affect
amyloid formation.4,20−22 The N-terminal
region and the disulfide bond of ovalbumin also strongly influence
the morphology of aggregates formed upon heating.5,23 Upon
reduction of the disulfide bond, long straight fibrils are formed
during heating at neutral pH, whereas semiflexibile fibrils are usually
observed after heating intact ovalbumin.5,24,25 The degree of branching increased with increasing
ionic strength.24 During the amyloid formation
of ovalbumin, the β-sheet content typically increases.5,23

Compressibility studies are frequently used to study conformational
transitions of globular proteins.26−29 Furthermore, they provide valuable
insights into protein hydration and intraglobular packing of protein
aggregates.30 The compressibility of proteins
in solution can be determined by measuring both the ultrasonic velocity
and density, with the protein’s compressibility composed of
a hydration compressibility and an intrinsic compressibility.31,32 The hydration compressibility is due to the change in the solvent
compressibility as water molecules interact with the solvent-accessible
groups of the proteins. Because water in the hydration shell is less
compressible than free bulk water, the hydration compressibility is
usually negative.29,31,32 The role of water in protein functionality cannot be understated,30,33 so techniques that assess changes in the restriction of water molecules
in the vicinity of proteins provide insights into the relationship
between the structure and behavior of proteins.28,33,34 The intrinsic compressibility is due to
imperfect packing of the polypeptide chain within the solvent-inaccessible
interior of the protein. It provides a positive contribution to the
protein’s overall compressibility. For liquids, the adiabatic
compressibility coefficient (βs) can be calculated from the
Laplace equation on the basis
of density (ρ) and ultrasound velocity (u)
measurements34 1  The principles of high-precision compressibility
measurements with ultrasound as well as their relation to the protein
structure have been recently reviewed by Zhang et al.35 Here, only selected aspects related to fibril formation
will be highlighted. The volumetric changes upon the fibril formation
seem to depend on the protein. Amyloid fibrils from β2-microglobulin and from a disulfide-deficient variant of hen egg
white lysozyme are more voluminous than the native structure,36−38 whereas a compaction was reported upon insulin fibril formation.39,40 These disparities in volumetric changes upon the fibril formation
of proteins likely reflect the intrinsic feature of polymorphism of
amyloid-like fibrils.36 Interestingly,
in contrast to the voluminous amyloid fibrils formed from β2-microglobulin, fibrils formed from the amyloidogenic core
peptide (K3) of β2-microglobulin were highly compact.
On the basis of these results, Lee et al.36 suggested that the amyloid fibrils of β2-microglobulin
consist of a tightly packed core structure surrounded by solvent-inaccessible
areas with a loose packing, rendering the amyloid fibrils compressible.
Clearly, more data are needed to comprehensively elucidate the trends
in the volumetric changes upon the amyloid fibril formation.37

In this research, we varied several factors
that induce amyloid-like
formation in proteins (pH, salt, and thermal processing) to generate
systems with varying degrees of amyloid-like aggregation in ovalbumin,
the major protein in egg white. The effect of disulfide reduction
and redox agents has been discussed elsewhere.41 The compressibility and hydration of these systems were
determined from ultrasonic measurements made at room temperature after
prior formation of amyloid-like aggregates at a high temperature as
well as in real time during amyloid formation at several temperatures.
To relate our understanding on the ovalbumin structural changes derived
from such measurements to those from conventional amyloidogenesis
assays, we interpreted the high-precision ultrasonic measurements
of velocity and attenuation in the context of fluorescence and dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements on the same systems.

Results and Discussion
Heating
of Ovalbumin at Neutral pH
Fluorescence Measurements and Particle Size
Ovalbumin
(2.0% w/w) was heated in the presence or absence of NaCl at different
temperatures for up to 1200 min. Figure 1a,b shows the ThT fluorescence and surface
hydrophobicity of the samples after cooling to room temperature, respectively.
The higher ThT fluorescence after heating suggests that ovalbumin
forms cross-β structures typical for the amyloid-like aggregation
when heated at neutral pH, which is in agreement with literature reports.21,22 The ThT fluorescence increased with heating time and heating temperature.
Similar fluorescence values were recorded after overnight heating
(1200 min) at 70 and 80 °C. The presence of salt did not affect
the ThT fluorescence after heating at 60 and 70 °C for 60 min
(Figure 1a and Table 1). Samples containing
salt heated at 70 °C for 1200 min and at 80 °C for 60 min
were highly viscous and turbid and, hence, could not be analyzed.

a Each sample was prepared twice and
then analyzed multiple times depending on the measurement technique
(duplicate for ThT measurements, single for the surface hydrophobicity
and fivefold for the particle size determination). In this table,
the range of duplicate sample preparations is reported in parentheses
(i.e., the difference between the averages of the one- to fivefold
measurements (depending on the measurement technique) of both sample
preparations).

b Samples containing
salt heated at
70 °C for 1200 min and at 80 °C for 60 min were highly viscous
and turbid and, hence, could not be analyzed.

The surface hydrophobicity calculated from fluorescence
measurements
in the presence of the fluorescent probe ANS increased with heating
time and temperature (Figure 1b). Conformational changes during the sample treatment evidently
result in the exposure of previously buried hydrophobic moieties.
The temperature-induced changes in surface hydrophobicity were unaffected
by the presence of salt when heating at 60 and 70 °C for 60 min
(Table 1).

Even
though clear changes in the surface hydrophobicity and ThT
fluorescence were observed after prolonged heating of ovalbumin at
60 °C and neutral pH, the particle size was hardly affected (Table 1). Heating at either
70 or 80 °C yielded particles of increased size, but even after
1200 min of heating, the particle size was still relatively small
(about 10 nm). Similar sizes were observed for heated solutions of
ovalbumin by Weijers et al.25 Significantly
bigger particles were formed when heating was performed in the presence
of salt. This indicates that the charges on ovalbumin at neutral pH
restrict its aggregation during heating. By ionic shielding of the
charges, bigger particles form under similar heating conditions. Ovalbumin
heated in the presence of salt at 70 °C for 1200 min and at 80
°C for 60 min was too viscous for analyses, which is likely due
to the presence of large branched aggregates.42 Studies on the effect of ionic strength on the morphology of aggregates
showed that flexible ovalbumin aggregates with very few branching
points are typically formed at low ionic strengths, whereas more densely
branched structures form at high ionic strengths.25,42

Ultrasound Properties
The selected experimental conditions
generated a range of changes in ovalbumin conformation and size. We
next examined how such structural changes altered the ultrasonic properties
of the protein solutions. The ultrasonic velocity of ovalbumin with
and without salt remained unaffected by heat treatment at 60 °C,
whereas a small but significant increase in the attenuation was observed
when heating without salt for at least 60 min at this temperature
(Tables 2 and 3). The lack of thermal effect on the ultrasonic
velocity of the ovalbumin
solution indicates that the adiabatic compressibility of the protein
was unaffected by this low-temperature heat treatment (eq 1). This suggests that either the
conformational changes induced by the heat treatment at 60 °C,
as evinced by fluorescence measurements, are too small to be detected
with ultrasound velocity measurements, or several changes induced
by heating have opposite effects on the ultrasonic velocity and cancel
each other out, as has been observed for thermally induced changes
in other proteins.29

a Each sample was prepared twice,

The standard deviation on the ultrasonic attenuation for each sample
preparation was typically below 0.05 × 10–14 s2/m. In this table, the range of duplicate sample preparations
is reported in parentheses (i.e., the difference between the averages
of the six or more measurements of both sample preparations).

Because salt clearly induced the
growth of particles (Table 1), particle size does
not appear to have a strong effect on the ultrasonic velocity and,
thus, on the adiabatic compressibility. Any aggregation would affect
the compressibility by decreasing the hydration contribution due to
increased protein–protein interactions at the expense of protein–water
interactions. A possible explanation for the lack of effect lies in
the type of aggregates. It has been reported that ovalbumin aggregates
formed after heating at neutral pH at rather low salt concentrations
are fibrillar.5 Hence, the area of contact
between aggregating molecules would be smaller than the overall surface
area exposed to water.

Heat treatment at 70 and 80 °C affects
both the ultrasonic
velocity and the attenuation (Tables 2 and 3). After heating for 60
min at 70 and 80 °C, the velocity was significantly lower than
that of the unheated samples. However, after 1200 min of heating at
80 °C, the ultrasonic velocity was actually greater than that
after heating for 60 min. The decrease in the velocity after heating
for 60 min indicates that the protein molecules are more compressible.

A significantly higher attenuation was observed after heating the
sample for 60 min at 70 °C than for the unheated sample, and
this increased further with prolonged heating (Table 3). The attenuation was already significantly
higher than that of the unheated sample after 5 min of heating at
80 °C, increased further with increasing the heating time up
to 60 min, and leveled off with further heating.

On the basis
of the various techniques, a picture of ovalbumin’s
thermally induced conformational changes was constructed and is shown
graphically in Figure 2. Heating at 60 °C and neutral pH for at least 60 min induces
structural changes (ThT and ANS fluorescence), but this altered structure
does not lead to an increase in size (DLS) unless charge repulsion
is suppressed, in which case long-term heating does increase the aggregate
size. The compressibility of these molecules is unaltered (velocity),
but the changes in conformation brought about by the thermal treatment
does cause a greater dissipation of the acoustic energy (increased
attenuation).

Figure 2 Schematic representation of ovalbumin’s thermally
induced
conformational changes. A distinction is made between different levels
of heat treatment.

With an increase in temperature,
more substantial changes in the
ovalbumin structure take place (Figure 2). A loosening of protein structure allows the hydrated
ovalbumin to become more compressible. As the molecular structural
changes associated with enhanced surface hydrophobicity and ThT fluorescence
tend to decrease compressibility (due to a less compressible hydration
shell and compact cross-β structures), it is the overall molecular
structure that becomes less compact. These heat-induced protein structures
likely contain a core composed of compact, cross-β structures,
surrounded by loosely packed areas, as was suggested for β2-microglobulin fibrils.36 Attenuation
changes are in line with the changes observed by ThT and ANS fluorescence
rather than with the changes in size (as measured with DLS), pointing
to the substantial conformational changes as temperature is increased.
Greater viscous losses associated with an opening up of ovalbumin’s
structure is one potent contributor to the increased attenuation.
As heating at these elevated temperatures is continued for extensive
periods, a tightening up of the structure occurs.

Real-Time
Analysis
The ultrasonic properties of the
above samples depended not only on the changes that occur during heat
treatment but also on the folding during cooling to room temperature.
To learn more about changes during heating at the selected temperatures,
ovalbumin samples were subjected to a thermal ramp (heating from 30
to 60, 70, or 80 °C at 0.3 °C/min) followed by a holding
phase of 120 min at the final temperature. During heating, the ultrasonic
velocity of both ovalbumin solution and the reference, water, increased
with increasing temperature up to about 70 °C and decreased with
further temperature increase. To investigate the effect of temperature
on the proteins alone, the ultrasonic profiles of the reference sample
(water) were subtracted from those of the ovalbumin solution.43

Figure 3a shows the difference in velocity between an ovalbumin
solution at pH 7.0 and the reference, defined as the relative velocity,
when heating from 30 to 80 °C. In agreement with the studies
on whey protein43 and α-lactalbumin,44 a decrease in the relative velocity with increasing
temperature was observed for ovalbumin solutions. The decrease in
the relative velocity with increasing temperature in this study was
highly linear to approximately 58 °C, at which point the decrease
in the relative velocity accelerated, and this acceleration was even
more at approximately 73 °C. Similar temperature inflexion points
were observed for normalized attenuation (Figure 3b). Therefore, the changes in the protein
structure that affected the fluorescence as temperature was raised
above 58 °C, but were accelerated considerably just above 70
°C, concurred with the enhanced reductions in velocity45 and increases in attenuation46 brought about by the thermal treatments (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Figure 3 (a) Relative ultrasonic velocity of ovalbumin
(2.0% w/w, pH 7.0)
during heating from 30 to 80 °C at 0.3 °C/min. The relative
ultrasonic velocity is the difference between the velocity of the
ovalbumin solution and the velocity of the reference, water. Three
representative curves are shown. (b) Normalized ultrasonic attenuation
of ovalbumin (2.0% w/w, pH 7.0) during heating from 30 to 80 °C
at 0.3 °C/min. The attenuation is normalized compared with the
ultrasonic attenuation value at 30 °C. Three representative curves
are shown.

Following the heating ramp, the
samples were kept at the final
temperature (60, 70, and 80 °C) for 120 min. In line with expectations
from the temperature ramp results of Figure 3, holding at 70 °C did lead to changes
in the ultrasonic properties. The ultrasonic velocity decreased continuously
as a function of time (total decrease: 0.17 ± 0.02 m/s), and
the attenuation increased (total increase: 1.8 ± 0.5 × 10–15 s2/m). It is interesting to point out
that, although the decrease in velocity was most pronounced during
the first 45 min of holding, the decrease occurred over the entire
120 min (Figure 4).
The conformational changes at this temperature were thus rather slow.
This is in agreement with the amyloid-like aggregation, which is typically
slow.47 The decreasing relative velocity
upon holding at 70 °C indicates that the compressibility increased
with a prolonged heat exposure. The increasing formation of cross-β
structures in the core of amyloid-like aggregates likely goes hand
in hand with a greater formation of loosely packed areas surrounding
that core. This seems reasonable when considering that only part of
the amino acid sequence of ovalbumin is involved in the cross-β
structures of the amyloid core.5 The increased
attenuation during holding at 70 °C is consistent with the conformational
changes.

Figure 4 Relative ultrasonic velocity of ovalbumin (2.0% w/w) at pH 2.0
(black, dashed line), pH 7.0 (black, full line), and pH 9.0 (gray,
full line) during isothermal heat exposure at 70 °C for 120 min.
The relative ultrasonic velocity is the difference between the velocity
of the ovalbumin solution and the velocity of the reference, water,
with the same amount of acid/alkali as the sample.

Both the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation remained
constant
during holding at 80 °C (results not shown). Apparently, no changes
affecting the ultrasonic properties occurred during holding at 80
°C. The lack of structural
changes when holding at 80 °C is because most of the ovalbumin
are already unfolded before the start of the holding phase, as its
denaturation midpoint temperature is 78 °C.16 The instrument’s rather low heating rate (to ensure
highly regulated temperatures) also exposes samples to relatively
high temperatures for a long time before the start of the holding
phase (e.g., heating from 70 to 80 °C at 0.3 °C/min takes
more than 30 min).

The changes in velocity and attenuation during
holding at 60 °C
were similar to those at 70 °C, but less pronounced. At 60 °C,
the ultrasonic velocity decreased continuously as a function of time
(total decrease: 0.03 ± 0.01 m/s) and the attenuation increased
(total increase: 0.6 ± 0.09 × 10–15 s2/m). Smaller changes in the ultrasonic properties during holding
at 60 °C are consistent with the changes in fluorescence. Although
no significant effect on the ultrasonic properties was observed when
heating at 60 °C was followed by cooling (Tables 2 and 3), a small,
but clear, effect was observed here, as the ovalbumin solutions were
maintained at 60 °C, pointing to the significance of 58 °C
as a critical transition temperature point for ovalbumin.

Heating of Ovalbumin at Acidic and Alkaline pH
Because
molecular charges have pronounced effects on protein aggregation at
different temperatures,15,33 we investigated how
changes in ovalbumin’s charge density induced changes in its
ultrasonic properties.

Fluorescence Measurements and Particle Size
Just as
for ovalbumin at neutral pH, the ThT fluorescence at pH 9.0 increased
with heating time and temperature (Table 1), but it was less pronounced. The ThT fluorescence
was also higher after heating at pH 2.0; however, in contrast to the
changes at pHs 7.0 and 9.0, the ThT fluorescence did not increase
with temperature.

Regardless of pH, surface hydrophobicity increased
for all heating conditions tested. It is of note that at pH 2.0 the
surface hydrophobicity of unheated ovalbumin was already much higher
than that at pHs 7.0 and 9.0, showing that acidification induced conformational
changes, thus exposing hydrophobic moieties.48 In contrast to the samples at pHs 7.0 and 9.0, those at pH 2.0 exhibited
similar surface hydrophobicity, irrespective of the duration of heating.

The effect of heating on particle size (Table 1) depended on both pH and salt. Similar to
that at neutral pH, the particle size did not increase at pH 9.0 when
ovalbumin was heated at 60 °C without salt. In the presence of
salt, the increase in the particle size of the ovalbumin molecules,
which was already observed at 60 °C at neutral pH, was arrested
until higher temperatures were attained at pH 9.0. The particle size
of the aggregates formed at 70 °C in the presence of salt was
also much smaller at pH 9.0, as the electrostatic repulsion of the
higher charge density on the molecules hinders protein aggregation.42 Charge density effects were not evident at pH
2.0 although bigger particles were formed when salt was present. This
enhanced aggregation is probably related to the low-temperature acid-induced
conformational changes with the exposed hydrophobic moieties driving
ovalbumin aggregation.

Ultrasound Properties
(Tables 4 and 5 show the ultrasonic
velocity and attenuation of ovalbumin at pHs 2.0 and 9.0 before and
after heat treatment at different temperatures. As several papers
have dealt with the effect of pH on the ultrasonic
properties of unheated proteins,27,49−51 we only discuss the effect of heat treatment at different pHs.

An increase
in the velocity with prolonged heating at 60 °C
in the presence of salt and at 80 °C without salt (pH 9.0) suggests
a decrease in the compressibility (eq 1). This decrease in compressibility was greater at
pH 9.0 than at pH 7.0. There were no obvious differences in the surface
hydrophobicity and ThT fluorescence that explained such differences
(Table 1). Either the
hydration contribution is higher (more negative) at pH 9 or the intrinsic
contribution is lower. When heated at a mild temperature under alkaline
conditions, ovalbumin is converted to the more thermostable S-ovalbumin.19 The overall change in the conformation due to
the conversion is small, but the conformational change does lead to
a decreased solvent accessibility of the hydrophobic core.52 Accordingly, a larger negative hydration contribution
likely yields the observed lower compressibility.

Attenuation
increases at both non-neutral pHs confirm that heating
to 60 °C and beyond induces conformational changes in ovalbumin
that dissipate acoustic energy more. An opening up of ovalbumin’s
structure so that enhanced viscous relaxation events occur is consistent
with these attenuation measurements.

Real-Time Analysis
Ovalbumin at pH 9.0 was also subjected
to a heating ramp, followed by a holding phase at 70 °C. The
same effects as at pH 7.0 were observed. The relative ultrasonic velocity
decreased during holding, and the magnitude of the decrease was similar
at both pH values (Figure 4). In contrast, no change in the ultrasonic velocity of acidified
ovalbumin held at 70 °C was apparent. The time exposed to elevated
temperatures as the sample was initially heated up to 70 °C likely
completed the conformational changes in the acid-induced thermally
sensitive ovalbumin.

Conclusions
High-precision
ultrasound measurements provide novel insights into
amyloid-like protein aggregation although the role of water at the
protein’s surface complicates data interpretation. Changes
in both the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation upon heating point
to a “loosening” of molecular structure that is underway
at 58 °C and is accelerated at approximately 73 °C. Fluorescence
changes support such temperature-dependent transformations in the
ovalbumin structure, but changes in the molecular size (from DLS measurements)
that occur upon prolonged heating, especially in saline solutions,
do not relate to acoustic measurements. Charge density is an important
factor in inducing the growth of aggregates. Acid-induced structural
changes in ovalbumin were also evident from the ultrasonic signatures.
Overall, these data suggest that the amyloid-like ovalbumin aggregates
consist of a compact core surrounded by loosely packed protein segments.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Ovalbumin with a purity of at least 90% was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (A5378; St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals,
solvents, and reagents were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
were at least of analytical grade.

Sample Preparation
Ovalbumin (0.8000 g) was dissolved
in degassed Milli-Q water (38 mL; Merck Millipore, Ontario, Canada)
with and without NaCl (0.0584 g) without agitation to prevent the
incorporation of air bubbles. Subsequently, the pH was adjusted to
2.0 or 7.0 with 1.0 or 0.1 M HCl or to 9.0 with 0.1 M NaOH and the
mass was adjusted to exactly 40.00 g. All samples were prepared at
least in duplicate. Next, 9.0 g of each solution was transferred to
a lidded test tube and the sample was heated for 0, 5, 60, and 1200
min at 60, 70, or 80 °C in a water bath. Hence, for each heating
condition, two samples were obtained, originating from two or more
separate sample preparations. After heating, the samples were allowed
to cool to room temperature before analysis.

ThT Fluorescence
The samples (190 μL) were transferred
to a 96-well plate, and 10 μL of a 200 μM ThT solution
was added. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Synergy
Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski,
VT). The excitation wavelength was 440 nm, and the emission was recorded
at 480 nm. Each sample was analyzed twice, and the reported values
are the ratio of the fluorescence readings of the heated samples to
those of the unheated samples.

ANS Fluorescence
The protein surface hydrophobicity
of samples was determined with ANS as a fluorescent probe. Supernatants
were diluted with 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to obtain
a range of protein concentrations from 0.007 to 0.1 mg/mL. All diluted
samples (200 μL) were transferred to a 96-well plate, and 10
μL of the ANS solution (8 mM in 0.01 M pH 7.0 sodium phosphate
buffer) was added. The fluorescence intensity of the protein samples
was measured with a Synergy Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments,
Inc.). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 390 and 480 nm,
respectively. The protein surface hydrophobicity was calculated as
in Chaudhuri et al.53 Hereto, the relative
fluorescence was first calculated as the difference between the fluorescence
intensities of the protein–ANS mixture and the control ANS
(ANS solution with buffer without protein) divided by the fluorescence
of the control ANS. The initial slope of the plot of the relative
fluorescence intensity as a function of the protein concentration
represents the protein surface hydrophobicity.

DLS
The samples
without salt were diluted (1:1) with
50 mM NaCl before analysis, whereas the samples with salt were diluted
(1:1) with a 25 mM NaCl solution. The final salt (25 mM) and protein
concentrations (1.0% w/w) of all samples were thus the same. The diluted
samples were examined by a Zetasizer Nano S DLS system (Malvern Instruments,
Malvern, U.K.). This system employs a 633 nm laser and a fixed scattering
angle (173°). The software supplied with the instrument calculates
the Stokes radius from the translational diffusion coefficient. It
is important to point out that the size obtained with this technique
is that of a sphere moving in the same manner as the scattering protein
aggregate (which is not necessarily spherical). Each sample was analyzed
five times.

Ultrasonic Measurements
The ultrasonic
measurements
were performed with a ResoScan device (TF Instruments GmbH, Heidelberg,
Germany). The ResoScan system measures the velocity and attenuation
of ultrasound propagating through the solution by a resonator method.54 The system, with two sample cells, is equipped
with a Peltier thermostat to maintain a constant temperature (±0.001
°C) and can heat or cool the samples in the cells at a rate of
0.1–0.35 °C/min. Two different setups were applied. In
the standard setup, the samples were heated in test tubes followed
by cooling (as described above) and the ultrasonic properties were
measured at 25 °C. The unheated samples were recorded as a reference.
Each sample was measured at least six times. As each sample was prepared
twice (see above), this corresponds to at least 12 measurements for
each reported condition (e.g., pH 7.0, heated at 80 °C). In the
ramp setup, the unheated samples (200 μL) were loaded in both
sample cells. The samples were heated at 0.3 °C/min from 30 °C
up to either 60, 70, or 80 °C, followed by a holding phase at
the final temperature. During the entire heating procedure, both the
ultrasonic velocity and the attenuation were recorded. The ramp setup
was performed three times for each sample.

Statistical Analysis and
Data Presentation
Statistical
analyses were conducted with JMP Pro software (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Significant differences (p < 0.05) for several
variables were determined using a one-way analysis of variance test.
Each sample was prepared twice and analyzed multiple times depending
on the analytical technique. The reported values are the averages
obtained by calculating the average of the multiple measurements for
each sample first and then the average of both values. The range cited
is the difference between the averages of both sample formulations.
