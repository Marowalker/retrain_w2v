The
inspiration behind this research is the development of tungsten
oxide (WO3) nanowires based, highly sensitive and selective sensing
devices directly on the active sensing platform. WO3 one-dimensional
nanowires were synthesized via the vapour-phase growth technique.
This approach allows the production of well-aligned and uniform nanowires
on alumina substrates with their diameter and length in the nanometer
range. The morphological and structural properties of nanowires have
been investigated by means of the field effect electron microscopy,
grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Finally, the fabricated WO3 nanowire sensing devices and their gas sensing performance were
investigated in the presence of different oxidizing and reducing gases
(especially environmental gases) at different temperatures. The WO3 sensors demonstrate high performance toward H2S and O3 at the optimal working temperatures of 400 and
200 °C, respectively, with the detection limit in the ppb level.

Introduction
In the class of important n-type metal
oxide semiconductors, tungsten
oxide (WO3) has attracted great attention due to its remarkable
physical and chemical properties.1 These
properties make WO3 an ideal candidate for different applications
such as electrochromic,2 photochromic,3 lithium batteries,4 and gas sensors.5,6 Moreover, it exhibits a wide band
gap ranging from 2.7 to 3.6 eV,7 and this
oxide is rather complex and can crystallize in a number of different
phases and crystals.1,8,9 In
the literature, numerous reports are available on the growth of WO3 nanostructures in the form of nanoparticles,10 thin films,11 nanorods,12 and nanowires.13 To
grow these nanostructures, hydrothermal reaction,14 sol–gel chemistry,15 thermal
oxidation,16 pulsed laser deposition,17 and thermal evaporation are most commonly used.18 Interestingly, nanostructured WO3 is vastly used in the area of gas sensing applications as it offers
excellent reproducibility, low-power consumption, and enhanced sensor
capabilities.1,19

In fact, over the years,
WO3 has proved to be one of
the important materials for the detection of toxic gases like NO2, NH3, H2S, CO, etc.5,20,21 Among these, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a typical air pollutant released by combustion facilities, automobiles,
and aircrafts. According to the air-quality monitoring protocols (American
standards) for NO2, the concentration should be detectable
in the range of 3–25 ppm.22 Moreover,
the decomposition of NO2 by solar irradiation is a common
source of ozone (O3) production.23 In many developed countries, the maximum safe concentration of ozone
is 50 ppb for continuous exposure and 100 ppb for short-term exposure.24 Another important toxic gas is hydrogen sulfide
(H2S), often produced in coal oil, coal, or natural gas
manufacturing. The threshold limit value (TLV) for H2S
is 10 ppm, while further exposure at concentrations higher than 100
ppm is dangerous to human life and can cause death.25 Therefore, reliable and low-cost sensors with high sensitivity
and selectivity are in great demand for environmental safety and industrial
control purposes.

The aim of this work is fabrication of ultrasensitive
WO3 nanowires based on gas sensors using a cost-effective
and high-yield
method, namely, the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) technique.
It presents several advantages such as the nonrequirement of precursors,
lowered reaction energy, and requires only a furnace system and primary
pumping for the growth of nanowires. Indeed, in the case of WO3, this technique has been rarely used.26 In the present study, complete optimization of the growth
process of the WO3 nanowires is presented. In particular,
the effect of different catalysts, substrate temperatures, and growth
time on the surface morphology of the nanowires is investigated using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystalline properties of
the nanowires were assessed using the grazing incident X-ray diffraction
(GI-XRD), and at the same time, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
and Raman spectroscopy were also used to study the surface chemical
and structural properties of the WO3 nanowires, respectively.
Finally, WO3 nanowires that exhibit the best crystalline
and surface morphological properties were used to fabricate gas sensor
devices for the detection of different concentrations of target gas
analytes such as NO2, H2S, O3, ethanol,
and acetone.

Results
Optimization of the Growth
Process and the Surface Morphological
Characterization of Nanowires
Scanning electron microscopy
has been employed to study the surface morphology of WO3 nanowires grown under different experimental conditions. In particular,
we have studied the influence of different catalysts, substrate temperatures
(Ts), as well as the effect of deposition
time on the growth of nanowires. Figure 1 reports the SEM images of WO3 nanowires grown with Au and Pt catalysts at an evaporation temperature
of 1100 °C. The substrates were kept at two different temperatures, Ts = 525 and 580 °C, and the deposition
was carried out for 15 min.

Figure 1 SEM images of WO3 nanowires at an
evaporation temperature
of 1100 °C, a pressure of 1 mbar, and an argon flow 100 sccm
for Au and Pt catalysts at substrate temperatures of 525 and 580 °C,
respectively.

It can be clearly observed from Figure 1 that both the type
of catalyst and the substrate
temperatures have a great influence on the growth of nanowires. In
the case of a platinum catalyst, no growth of nanowires was observed
at both Ts = 525 and 580 °C. On the
other hand, using Au as a catalyst, the WO3 nanowire growth
covering the whole alumina substrate has been observed. In particular,
nanowires grown at Ts = 525 °C possess
a diameter in the range of 10–30 nm and length less than 100
nm. With the increase in Ts (at 580 °C),
the nanowires start to grow longer when compared to the ones at lower
temperatures.

Further investigations reveal that the growth
of nanowires using
the Pt catalyst can be observed only at higher substrate temperatures. Figure 2 reports the growth
of WO3 nanostructures on both Au and Pt catalysts at Ts = 700 °C. In comparison, both exhibit
similar morphology (nanorods), while the density of grown structures
was low in the case of Pt as compared to that of Au. Hence, the substrate
temperature of 525 °C and Au as a catalyst have been found suitable
for the growth of nanowires.

Figure 2 SEM images of WO3 nanowires at an
evaporation temperature
of 1100 °C, a pressure of 1 mbar, and an argon flow of 100 sccm
for Au and Pt catalysts at a substrate temperature of 700 °C.

Furthermore, the effect of deposition time, while
keeping the other
conditions constant (1100 °C, Ar = 100 sccm, Ts = 525 °C, P = 1 mbar), on the
growth of WO3 nanowire has been investigated. Figure 3 shows the comparison
of nanowires grown using Au catalyst at two different deposition times
(15 and 20 min). The nanowires prepared with a longer deposition time
(20 min) are denser as they grow longer, with their length in the
micrometer range. On the other hand, nanowires prepared with a shorter
deposition time (15 min) possess length and diameter in the nanometer
range. The dimensions and the morphology of nanowires grown on the
Au catalyst at these experimental conditions (1100 °C, Ar = 100
sccm, Ts = 525 °C, P = 1 mbar, deposition time = 15 min) are suitable for fabricating
conductometric sensing devices. Hence, these WO3 nanowires were used
for further characterizations and sensor device fabrication.

of 1100 °C, a pressure of 1 mbar, and an argon flow of 100 sccm

the deposition times of 15 and 20 min.

Structural Characterization of Nanowires Using GI-XRD and Raman
Spectroscopy
GI-XRD analysis was performed to study the crystalline
structure of WO3 nanowires. Figure 4 represents the GI-XRD pattern recorded for
WO3 nanowires, which indicates the presence of WO3 and the Au catalyst. The extra peaks observed in the spectra indexed
with (*) correspond to the alumina substrate. The crystallographic
planes of WO3 nanowires and their corresponding values
of 2θ equal to 23.08, 24.21, 26.52, 28.72, 34.04, 41.69, 47.20,
50.44, and 55.82° are attributed to the (001), (200), (120),
(111), (220), (121), (221), (240), and (132) crystallographic planes,
respectively. According to the literature and JCPDS data file no.
05-0392, these spectra indicate the growth of the monoclinic phase
of WO3 nanowires.27,28

On the other hand, Figure 5 reports the Raman spectrum of WO3 nanowires along
with the spectra of the alumina substrate. WO3 peaks were
clearly observed at 807, 708, 328, and 270 cm–1.
Compared to the literature,29 the peaks
observed at 807 and 708 cm–1 represent the monoclinic
crystalline phase of WO3 that corresponds to the W–O–W
stretching vibrations of the bridging oxygen. On the other hand, peaks
at 328 and 270 cm–1 belong to bending vibrations
of O–W–O bonds.30

alumina substrate.

X-ray Photoelectron Investigation
of WO3 Nanowires
The surface composition and the
chemical states of the elements
in the WO3 nanowire sample were investigated by the XPS
technique. The survey scan spectrum in Figure 6a of WO3 nanowires indicates that
the surface of the sample is mainly composed of tungsten, gold, and
oxygen elements with carbon contamination. In particular, the peak
observed at 284.3 eV is attributed to the presence of carbon,31 which is a commonly adsorbed compound on the
surface of the sample at room temperature. On the other hand, Figure 6b represents the
W 4f spectra with two prominent peaks at 35.3 and 37.4 eV for W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively.32 These 4f doublet peak lines are separated by a binding
energy of 2.1 eV, which is in line with the literature33 and represents the +6 oxidation state of tungsten.34Figure 6d shows the O 1s peak that can be resolved into two components,
one at 530 eV and the other observed at 532.6 eV.32 The O 1s peak at 530 eV corresponds to the oxygen in the
lattice and O2– ions, while the peak at 532.6 eV
might be observed due to O2– and O– ions in the oxygen-deficient region.

scan, (b) W 4f, (c) Au 4f, and (d) O
1s acquired at room temperature.

Furthermore, the XPS study also shows the presence of Au catalysts
on the WO3 nanowire sample. The Au 4f (Figure 6c) peaks at 83.6 and 87.3 eV
were assigned to two different states of gold, i.e., Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2, respectively.34

Gas Sensing
In the present work, WO3 nanowire
sensors were tested toward different reducing (CO, ethanol, acetone,
and H2S) and oxidizing (NO2 and ozone) gases.
It is well known that in the sensor technology, selectivity is an
important aspect and is usually very hard to achieve. However, it
is somehow possible to enhance the selectivity of the devices by changing
the operating temperature, and hence tuning the performance of the
sensing device toward the specific target compounds. The WO3 nanowire sensors were operated within a range of temperatures to
identify the optimal one for each target gas. Then, at that optimal
working temperature (unique value for each gas), sensors were used
to detect different concentrations of gas, and the collected data
were used to draw calibration curves from which the lowest detection
limit has been calculated.

To find the optimal working temperature
of a sensor, response vs temperature curves for different gases are
shown in Figure 7.
The response of WO3 sensors was calculated by using eqs 4 and 5 with respect to the
different operating temperatures at a fixed relative humidity of 50%
at 20 °C. We decided to keep humidity constant during these preliminary
investigations at a value close to the application requirements. Different
concentrations of gases have been chosen according to their exposure
limits. For example, as reported in the introduction, TLV for H2S is 10 ppm. Therefore, in Figure 7, each concentration was chosen according
to the limit for that specific gas over which it became either dangerous
to human health or to the environment. It can be clearly observed
from Figure 7 that
WO3 nanowires show the highest response toward H2S at an optimal working temperature of 400 °C, while at 200
°C, sensors show a higher response toward O3. Thus,
modulating the operating temperature can indeed promote a partial
selectivity between O3 (at a lower temperature) and H2S (at a higher temperature).

Figure 7 Temperature dependence response of WO3 sensing device
measured with a relative humidity of 50% at 20 °C.

Figure 8a,b
shows
the dynamic response of WO3 nanowires toward H2S and O3 gases at their optimal working temperatures.
The sensors show a decrease in the electrical conductance on the exposure
of O3 (oxidizing gas), while for H2S (reducing
gas), the conductance increases. This shows the typical behavior of
n-type semiconductors.35−37

Figure 8 Dynamic response of WO3 sensing devices toward
reducing
gases (a) hydrogen sulfide (10–20 ppm) at 400 °C and (b)
ozone (50–150–300 ppb), measured at 200 °C with
a relative humidity of 50% at 20 °C.

Furthermore, Figure 9 reports the calibration curve, i.e., response vs gas concentration,
for H2S and ozone at their optimal work temperatures. The
experimental data for calibration
graph were well fitted by the typical power-trend relationship for
metal oxide sensors38 1  where A and B are constants typical of the sensing
material and the stoichiometry
of the involved reactions. Table 1 reports the values of coefficients A and B along with the estimated detection limits
for target gases O3 and H2S by considering a
response of 1 as the minimum response to have a detectable signal.

O3	200	1800	1.8	0.017 ppm (17 ppb)	
The gas sensing
mechanism for the detection of H2S and
O3 can be explained based on the conduction changes originated
from the adsorption/desorption process upon the interaction with analytes.35,39,40 When the n-type WO3 nanowire system is exposed to the ambient air, a chemisorption of
oxygen molecules on the surface occurs, resulting in the formation
of adsorbed O2–, O–, and O2– ions,12,41 among which,
in the temperature range of 150 < T < 400 °C,
O– ions dominate the surface, while at a higher
temperature, O2– adsorbents dominate the oxide surface.42 These adsorbed ions start capturing electrons
from the outermost region of WO3, due to which the electron
concentration starts to decrease, resulting in the formation of the
electron depletion layer (Figure 10a). When the H2S gas interacts with the
WO3 nanowires, the gas molecules react with the surface-adsorbed
O2– ions, modulating their population
and thus changing the electrical properties of the material.43 2  As a consequence
of this reaction, extra electrons
were donated back to WO3, resulting in a decrease in the
depletion layer thickness (Figure 10a). Hence, the conductance of WO3 sensors
was increased when exposed to H2S gas (seen in the dynamic
response curves in Figure 8a).

Figure 10 Sketch of the proposed gas sensing mechanism of the WO3 nanowire sensor system toward (a) H2S and (b)
O3.

However, on the contrary, when
the sensors were exposed to an oxidizing
gas such as ozone, the conduction alteration followed an opposite
trend, as shown in Figure 8b. The WO3 nanowire sensors exhibit the highest
response toward O3 at an operating temperature of 200 °C.
It is a well-known fact that ozone is a highly unstable gas and dissociates
to O2 gas by releasing O– ions promptly
at a temperature higher than 150 °C.44,45 Indeed, O3 gas has a significant dipole moment and its
geometry is such that its central atom possesses a positive charge
and the other side atoms possess a negative charge. When this central
atom interacts with the WO3 surface, it accepts electrons
from its conduction band, while the other two atoms form the O2 gas.39,46 This effect can be described
by the following equation 3  Due to the
highly accepting character of O3, the concentration of
the surface-adsorbed O– ions increases, which in
turn increases the electron depletion layer
thickness and decreases the sensor conductance upon ozone exposure
(Figure 10b).

Comparison
with the Literature
Furthermore, the sensing
performances of the nanowire sensors toward H2S and ozone
have also been compared with the literature reported in Table 2. Although the optimal working
temperature for WO3 nanowires toward H2S was
found to be 400 °C, for a clear analysis, we have compared the
response of WO3 nanowire sensors at 300 °C against
the reported literature. Sensing data in Figure 10 for H2S show that our sensing
devices have a superior performance even at temperatures lower than
their optimal one (300 °C). Indeed, WO3 nanowire sensors
exhibit a response double than that of the highest reported value
in the literature.

On the other hand, in the case of O3 gas,
very few reports
have been found in the literature. Different types of WO3 sensing devices for the detection of O3 have been reported
in the literature such as in the form of thin films and nanorods.
The optimal working temperature was found to be quite similar to the
other reported values (Table 2). However, the response of our WO3 nanowire sensors
is 100 times higher as compared to the literature data at the ppb
level of O3.

Conclusions
The WO3 nanowires
were successfully grown using a simple,
highly productive VLS method on the Au-deposited alumina substrate,
having a diameter in the range of 20–30 nm. GI-XRD and Raman
spectroscopy studies confirm the monoclinic phase of WO3 nanowires. The observation of two distinct W 4f peaks in the XPS
spectra shows that the tungsten (W) is in the +6 oxidation state.
Finally, the WO3 nanowire sensor shows the best performance
toward H2S and ozone at optimal working temperatures of
400 and 200 °C, respectively. Indeed, the control on the working
temperature of the sensors results in tuning the selectivity of the
device toward a specific gas. The sensors showed a response of 103
toward 10 ppm of H2S, while in the case of ozone, at 300
ppb, the highest response was found to be 170. Considering the lowest
response value equal to 1 for each gas, the WO3 nanowire
sensors have detection limits in the ppb level that proves a superior
performance compared to the literature reports.

Experimental Section
Substrate
Preparation
Alumina substrates (4 mm2, 99% purity,
Kyocera, Japan) were used to grow tungsten oxide
nanowires. Prior to the growth process, the substrates were ultrasonically
cleaned with acetone and dried using synthetic air.

Growth of WO3 Nanowires
For the synthesis
of WO3 nanowires, an ultra-thin layer of noble metal catalysts
was deposited using magnetron sputtering on alumina substrates. To
optimize the growth process of WO3 nanowires, two different
metal catalysts, namely platinum (Pt) and gold (Au), were used. Different
deposition conditions were employed to deposit these metal catalysts
to obtain the same approximate thickness. These conditions are Ar
plasma = 7 sccm, radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, 70 W,
and 5 s for gold, whereas for platinum, Ar plasma = 7 sccm, direct
current (DC) magnetron sputtering, 70 W, and 2 s.

After catalyst
deposition, WO3 nanowires were grown via the vapor−liquid−solid
(VLS) method. This whole growth process was performed in an alumina
tubular furnace (custom design based on the commercial Lenton furnace).
The WO3 powder (99.9% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as
the source material. The metal oxide powder was placed at the center
of the tubular furnace at a given temperature to promote evaporation.
The catalyst-deposited substrates
were placed at a lower temperature when compared to the evaporation
temperature of the source material. Inert argon gas was used as a
carrier gas to transport these WO3 vapors toward the catalyzed
alumina substrates. The growth of WO3 nanowires was carried
out at an evaporation temperature of 1100 °C, 1 mbar of pressure,
and 100 sccm of argon flow. The substrate temperature was varied from
500 to 700 °C and deposition was carried out for 15 and 20 min
to acquire the preferable surface morphology of nanowires.

Characterizations
A field-emission scanning electron
microscope LEO 1525 (Gemini model; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany)
was operated at 3–5 kV to investigate the surface morphology
of the nanowires. The GI-XRD technique (Empyrean diffractometer, PANalytical,
the Netherlands) was used to investigate the crystalline structure
of WO3 nanowires. The GI-XRD was performed in a glancing
angle mode, with 1.5° incident angle using Cu-LFF (λ =
1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV to 40 mA. The spectra were recorded
by a parallel-plate collimated proportional Xe detector with a nickel
large-β filter, in the range of 20–70°. Near-ambient
pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SPECS GmbH, Germany, Al
Kα monochromatized source) allow the chemical analysis of the
surface of the materials in the hundreds pascals range atmosphere.
In our experiment, the pressure inside the cell was 300 Pa, the atmosphere
composition was 80% nitrogen and 20% oxygen to simulate in-operando
working conditions, and measurements were performed at room temperature.
All reported binding energy data were calibrated using the C 1s peak
of the residual C contamination at the surface of the materials. Further,
for the fitting and analysis of XPS data, KolXPD software has been
used. Moreover, Raman spectra of WO3 nanowires were measured
using a HORIBA monochromator iHR320 configured with a grating of 1800
g mm–1, coupled to a Peltier-cooled Synapse CCD.
An He–Cd laser (442 nm) was focused on the samples by a fiber-coupled
confocal optical microscope (HORIBA) at 100× magnification. The
spectra of the nanowires were recorded in the wavelength range of
200–1000 cm–1.

Sensor Fabrication and
Gas Sensing Measurement
A set
of WO3 nanowire samples was prepared for gas sensing applications.
To fabricate the sensing device, TiW alloy pads were deposited by
DC magnetron sputtering (70 W argon plasma, 300 °C, 5.5 ×
10–3 mbar, and 3 min), which improves the mechanical
adhesion during the soldering process. Afterward, interdigited platinum
contacts were deposited on the top of nanowires by using the same
parameters as described before the deposition time of 20 min.

Metal oxide surface reactions are strongly thermally activated and
thus the sensing performance of WO3 nanowires is also strongly
influenced by the temperature. Therefore, to enable the test of these
WO3 sensors in a wide range of temperatures, a platinum
heater was deposited on the backside of the samples, via the same
process used for the contacts deposition. The prepared sensor devices
were finally mounted on transistor outline packages using electrosoldered
gold wires. To stabilize the contact material, the sensors were aged
at 400 °C for 72 h prior to the electrical measurements. Such
transducers were prepared using thin- or thick-film technologies;
the temperature uniformity is good, but unfortunately the power consumption
is quite high, in the range of 180–490 mW for 200–400
°C for a 2 × 2 mm2 substrate.52

A flow-through technique was used to investigate
the conductometric
sensing response of the fabricated devices.38,53 A lab-made stainless steel chamber (1 L volume) was used to test
the sensors. To minimize the effect of external temperature variations,
the temperature of the chamber was set at 20 °C. The temperature
of the sensors was controlled by modulating the electric power applied
to the heater by Thurlby-Thander PL330DP power supplies. After the
placement of all of the sensors inside the test chamber, they were
heated at the desired working temperature for 8 h for thermal stabilization.
All test gases came from certified bottles, supplied by SIAD SpA (Italy),
and they were mixed with a carrier of dry synthetic air by mass-flow
controllers (MKS Instrument, Germany), maintaining a 200 sccm total
flow. A fixed voltage of 1 V was applied to the sensors (Agilent E3631A
power supply), measuring at the same time the conductance of each
sensor using pico-ammeters (Keithley 486). The response is determined
by the variation of the conductance using the following formulae52 for oxidizing gas 4  and reducing gas 5  where Rgas and Ggas are, respectively, the sensor resistance
and conductance in the presence of the gas, and Rair and Gair in synthetic
air.
