Silicalite-1-type
zeolites with unique intracrystal holes or cracks
were successfully prepared using a cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as an
additional mediating material, and their vapor phase adsorption properties
toward methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) were examined. It was found
that the mixing protocol of CNF and structure-directing agents (SDAs),
the addition amount of CNF, and the CNF/SDAs amount ratio play important
roles in forming the holed silicalite-1. The synthesis route that
preliminarily mixes CNF with SDAs in a series of controlled conditions
is particularly beneficial for the formation of the holed silicalite-1
with mesoporosity and larger pores because the CNF-SDAs composite
structure benefits the zeolite growth closely encompassing CNF inside
the crystal structure. It also promotes the preferential formation
of the orthorhombic phase vicinal to the CNF surface, namely, the
surface of the formed internal holes or cracks, with the twin-type
crystal size reduced as compared to the non-CNF-templated sample.
On the contrary, the synthesis route that mixes CNF with SDAs–silicate
composite ions tends to modify the twin-type crystal shape at the
same time to form small but uniform well-crystallized particles with
less holes or cracks and a dominative monoclinic phase. It was considered
that both the inter-subunit structural defect and silanol defect whose
content is increased with CNF addition influence the adsorptivity
of MTBE and NDMA. Owing to the small twin-type crystal size, the smaller
crystal subunits, and the favored short path from the surface of internal
holes or cracks, the holed silicalite-1 derived from the CNF and SDA
premixture assures the easiest access of adsorbate molecules to the
most energetically favored sites and is most appropriate for the adsorption
of both MTBE and NDMA among the examined zeolites.

Introduction
Zeolites with intrinsic
micropores have been widely used in adsorption
and petrochemical catalysis due to well-defined microporosity, shape
selectivity, high thermal/hydrothermal stability, and strong solid
acidity.1−3 Besides several key factors such as crystal type,
pore aperture, and Si/Al ratio, mass transport inside pore channels
is a big issue in terms of their applications for adsorption and catalysis
because the small pore size possibly causes clogging so as to inhibit
the access of adsorbates, reactants, or products to the interior or
exterior pore space.3 This is particularly
important in a high-flux treatment process where a long diffusion
path can significantly lower the utilization efficiency of zeolite
pores.4 For overcoming this dilemma, formation
of nanosized zeolite crystals, their organization into a hierarchical
structure having secondary mesoporosity or macroporosity, or, recently,
fabrication of thin two-dimensional zeolite-based hierarchical structures
have been attempted.5−9 The coexistence of additional templates such as porous carbon, cationic
polymers, etc. during the formation process of a zeolitic framework
is a usual and facile way to endow mesoporosity or macroporosity.10−16 For doing this, the interaction compatibility of additional templates
with structure-directing agent (SDA) ions and primary silicate/aluminate
ions (monomers, dimers, or oligomers) was considered to be the key
factor. A cellulose nanofiber (CNF) with nanosized diameter, very
high aspect (length vs diameter) ratio, and plenty of surface hydroxyl
groups is anticipated to be a unique and suitable auxiliary species
or a secondary template in zeolite synthesis.17 For instance, its excellent emulsifying property in water is beneficial
for improving the uniformity of synthesis solution. The easily dissociative
hydroxyl groups on its surface can serve as an assisting catalyst
to tune the hydrolyzing and polymerizing processes of framework precursors
or affect the growth process of a zeolite framework through interaction
with SDA ions.18 It is also expected that
the unique nanofiber morphology or certain kinds of its assembly structure
are imprinted during the synthesis process and retained in the formed
zeolite structure.

Among the zeolite family, the all-silica
(aluminum-free) mordenite
framework inverted (MFI)-type silicalite-1 zeolite has attracted a
great deal of attention due to the thermal/structural stability, medium
pore opening (0.51–0.56 nm), and hydrophobicity with a tunable
amount of internal silanol groups (depending on the synthesis approach)
but lacking solid acidity.3 These properties
make it promising, in particular, for concentrating dilute organics
from aqueous solution in the biofuel production process19,20 or selectively removing low concentration of solvent pollutants
from the water environment such as methyl tert-butyl
ether (MTBE) in underground water, the trace residual n-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in reclaimed water, and so forth.21−23 Herein, we attempted to use CNF as a meso/macroporogen additive
in the synthesis of silicalite-1. We found that a unique holed silicalite-1
crystal, whose suitable intracrystal structure is excellent for adsorbing
solvent molecules, can be obtained by appropriately controlling synthesis
protocols and conditions.

Results and Discussion
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR)
Spectra
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of silicalite-1 synthesized without and with
addition of CNF. The silicalite-1(0) exhibits the pattern typical
of the MFI-type framework topology.24 Its
structure is similar to that of HSZ(1500) (Figure S1), except for an intensified (020) vs (101) reflection. It
is obvious that the crystallinity of the CNF-mediated zeolites relies
on the synthesis route, the addition amount of CNF or that relative
to SDA ions, and other synthesis conditions. For the samples synthesized
by route A, a little addition of CNF improves the growth of the MFI-type
crystal, peculiarly causing an enhanced (101) diffraction with respect
to the (020) one [Figure 1A(b)]. By further increasing x to more than
0.5, it is observed that the (020) reflection relative to the (101)
one gradually increases in intensity and becomes the maximum at x = 2 [Figure 1A(c–e)]. For the samples synthesized by route B, similarly,
improved crystallinity appears by a little addition of CNF at x = 0.1 [Figure 1B(b)]. While the MFI-type crystallinity is quite good for
all of the samples synthesized at x = 0.5–2,
preferential growth of the (020) plane vs the (101) one is not observed
when elevating the addition amount of CNF [Figure 1B(c–e)]. The crystallinity of both
samples synthesized by routes A and B becomes very much less defined
at the largest CNF addition (x = 5) [Figure 1A(f),B(f)]. Thus, CNF, particularly
on a little addition, is able to improve the crystalline growth of
zeolites by serving as an excellent emulsifier to improve solution
uniformity. On the other hand, route A is a synthesis strategy preferential
for preliminary contact of CNF with the tetrapropylammonium ion (TPA+) SDA. Easier interaction of CNF with TPA+ at a
higher addition amount of CNF thereby may change or lower the role
of TPA+ as SDA to direct the framework growth of the zeolitic
crystal. To confirm this, the addition amount of TPA+ SDA
(y) vs CNF was elevated for the route A synthesis
at the condition of x = 2. As expected, increasing
the amount of TPA+ improves the crystalline growth and
peculiarly leads to the intensified reflection of (101) vs (020) [Figure 1C(g–i)]. Increasing
the hydrothermal treatment time further increases crystalline growth
but does not greatly change the XRD profiles [Figure 1C(i,j–l)].

and blue vertical lines in the insets indicate monoclinic and orthorhombic
phases, respectively.

It is known that distinctions
in the crystal system (monoclinic
or orthorhombic framework structure) of silicalite-1 can be identified
by a closer look at diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22–25°.19,20,25 The monoclinic and orthorhombic
framework structures of silicalite-1 differ from each other mainly
in terms of a slight modification in the shape and size of the sinusoidal
channel [elliptical with major axes of 0.59 and 0.58 nm for the monoclinic
structure vs nearly circular (0.53 × 0.56 nm2) for
the orthorhombic structure].26 Their differences
in XRD patterns are revealed mainly by a group of triplet, triplet,
and doublet peaks at the range of 2θ = 22.5–25.6, 25.6–24.1,
and 24.2–24.7°, respectively, for the monoclinic framework
structure in contrast to doublet, doublet, and single peaks at the
same 2θ range, respectively, for the orthorhombic one. By detailed
examination and comparison (Figures 1, S2, and S3), it can be
concluded that all of the silicalite-1 samples obtained consist of
mixed crystal phases of monoclinic and orthorhombic symmetries. While
the well-crystallized samples contain more fraction of the monoclinic
framework structure, the less crystallized ones or those with the
preferentially grown (020) plane have comparatively more fraction
of the orthorhombic framework structure. It is interesting that the
fraction ratio of the symmetry type in CNF-mediated synthesis by route
A experiences changes from more monoclinic phase to more orthorhombic
one by increasing x from 0.1 to 2 and to more monoclinic
one again by increasing the addition of TPA+ from y = 0.25 to 0.75 at x = 2 (i.e., the silicalite-1(2CNF-y-t) series samples) to achieve higher
crystallized silicalite-1 [Figures 1, S2A, and S3]. On the contrary,
the fraction of monoclinic vs orthorhombic symmetries does not seriously
change when changing x from 0.1 to 2 in the CNF-mediated
synthesis by route B [Figures 1 and S2B]. The result strongly
and reasonably suggests that preliminary contact of CNF and TPA+ favors the growth of the orthorhombic framework structure
around the CNF surface. Hence, the orthorhombic part is more likely
compartmented near the surface of CNF relative to the monoclinic part
in a crystal particle of the well-crystallized silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96)
sample. This is a major structural difference between the silicalite-1
crystals obtained from routes A and B.

Figure 2 compares
the FT-IR spectra of several well-crystallized silicalite-1 samples.
In the range of 500–1500 cm–1, besides those
at 795 and 1055–1221 cm–1 due to symmetry
and asymmetry vibration modes of Si–O–Si, a sharp peak
at 547 cm–1 comes from double-ring vibration mode,
characteristic of a well-crystallized silicalite-1 structure.3 From the spectra of silicalite-1(0) in the range
of 2500–4000 cm–1, the appearance of a broad
bond around 3440 cm–1 is the characteristic of internal
silanol (Si-OH) defects (silanol nest) resulted from the detachment
of a Si atom from the framework or the loss of charge balance centers
in the formation process of the zeolite.27 It has been reported previously that the internal Si-OH defects
are usually formed in an alkaline synthesis approach where OH– drives the mineralization.20 It is observed that a shoulder peak at around 3658 cm–1, ascribable to the vibration mode of vicinal Si-OH H-bonded to external
water, appears first for the CNF-mediated silicalite-1 at a smaller x (Figure 2d),28 and then an additional peak at 3609
cm–1, ascribable to bridging silanol group (H-bonded
vicinal Si-OH groups),27,29 becomes evident for those samples
obtained at a higher x (Figure 2c,e). It is thus reasonable that donation
of CNF in the formation process of silicalite-1 modifies the types
of surface silanol groups on silicalite-1 such that some specific
or neighboring silanol groups are formed or their amounts are relatively
increased. This was made possible because of the close contact of
the silicalite-1 surface with the hydroxyl-group-enriched CNF in the
synthesis process.

and silicalite-1(0.25-xCNF-24) at x = (d) 0.1 and (e) 0.5 in the range of 500–1500 and 2500–4000
cm–1, measured by attenuated total reflection (ATR)
and KBr-transmission methods, respectively.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and N2 Adsorption
The changes in morphologies of the CNF-mediated synthesis products
were examined in detail by SEM observations. As shown in Figures 3a and S5a, the silicalite-1(0) shows the typical twin
type (or coffin-type) morphology, which changes to smaller well-defined
crystals or aggregates of smaller crystals (∼30% in the whole
field of view) when synthesized at x = 0.1 by route
A (Figures S5b and Table S1). Almost entirely
spherelike particles or particle aggregates (seldomly a few twin-type
larger crystals) are observed for all of the products synthesized
at x = 0.5–5. Preferential growth of the (020)
vs (101) plane or finally the loss of crystallinity resulted from
the synthesis conditions of high CNF addition is accompanied by the
decrease in the size of these particles with the increase of x [Figures S5c–f and Table S1]. The twin-type crystal morphology becomes clear again when y is increased to 0.75 at x = 2, whose
size is greatly enlarged when t is increased to 96
h (Figures S6 and Table S1). Particularly,
many holes or cracks are clearly visualized on the surface of almost
all of the crystal particles in silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96), whereas
they are absent in silicalite-1(0) and silicalite-1(0.1CNF-0.25-24)
(Figure S5b). This strongly evidences that
CNF is involved in structural formation of silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96),
serving as a substrate to localize TPA+ SDA so as to direct
the growth of zeolite crystals vicinal to its surface.

(b) silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96),
and silicalite-1(0.25-xCNF-24) with x = (c) 0.1 and (d) 0.5.

On the other hand, addition
of CNF at x ≤
2 by route B is very effective in improving formation of (three or
two dimensional) size-reduced, well-defined, and more uniform crystals
as compared to silicalite-1(0) (Figures S7 and Table S2). The silicalite-1 crystals tend to aggregate to round
particles when x is increased to more than 1 and
are seldomly found in the product synthesized at x = 5 showing less crystallinity (as confirmed by the XRD result in Figure 1B(f)). While dimension
parameters (AR, c/a, c/b, a/b) of the
products from route A are almost the same at different synthesis conditions
(Table S1), those from route B appear to
change more evidently with CNF addition (Table S2), indicative of a different manner of CNF in relation to
the crystal growth of silicalite-1 in synthesis route B as compared
to synthesis route A. Still, holes or cracks can be found on the surface
of some crystals (Figure 3c,d), but the number is less and the crystal looks more solid.
These results suggest that CNF rather plays a role as an emulsifier
than as a template in the route B synthesis where less TPA+ SDA is allowed to interact with CNF.

Figure 4 shows the
N2 adsorption isotherms on the three well-crystallized
CNF-mediated silicalite-1 from routes A and B in comparison with those
on silicalite-1(0) and HSZ(1500). All isotherms show a sharp (type
I) uprising in N2 adsorption at p/p0 < 0.05, characteristic of a microporous
crystal; a jump increase in adsorption at medium p/p0 (0.1–0.5) range, well-known
for the phase change of N2 in zeolitic channels; and a
very small adsorption hysteresis, indicative of ignorable mesoporosity.30,31 The phase change step in adsorption of N2 on silicalite-1(0)
and the CNF-mediated silicalite-1 is more gradual and occurs at a
higher p/p0 range as
compared to that on HSZ(1500). The difference may be attributed to
the delicate distinction in crystal configuration and phase constitution.
As shown in Figure S1, HSZ(1500) shows
the morphology of aggregates of small squared crystals whose orthorhombic
phase is more mature, as revealed by the singlelike XRD peak around
2θ = 24.4°, which covers peaks from the monoclinic phase.
In contrast, silicalite-1(0) and the CNF-mediated silicalite-1 are
twin-type shape crystals whose monoclinic phase is more refined, as
evidenced by the well-separated doublet peaks in the 2θ range
of 24.1–24.7°. On the other hand, the isotherm on silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96)
overlaps with that on silicalite-1(0), except for a slightly enhanced
adsorption at p/p0 >
0.5 and an evident H3-type hysteresis loop, typical of platelet aggregates.31 This indicates that formation of holes or cracks
between smaller platelet-like crystal subunits is most likely responsible
for mesoporosity (and possibly a little macroporosity) in silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96).
On the contrary, synthesis by route B contributes to the increase
in microporosity rather than mesoporosity, as revealed by a much higher
N2 adsorption at p/p0 < 0.05 as compared to silicalite-1(0). In Table 1, the value of the specific
surface area is increased from 370 m2 g–1 for silicalite-1(0) to 449 and 421 m2 g–1 for the route B CNF-mediated samples. Of all the samples, only the
holed silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96) shows mesoporosity. By comparison,
the isotherm of HSZ(1500) also shows a higher uprising in N2 adsorption at p/p0 >
0.9, which is attributed to the existence of more external surface
(macroporosity) rather than mesoporosity because of the absence of
adsorption hysteresis (Table 1). Additionally, N2 adsorption on the samples showing
the morphology of spherical aggregates is either decreased or very
less (Figure S9), indicating that either
growth of zeolitic frameworks is insufficient or nonporous and amorphous
particles are formed in these samples. Furthermore, the samples with
preferentially grown (020) planes and relatively more orthorhombic
phase do not show a jump increase in N2 adsorption at the
medium p/p0 range [Figure S9A(c,d)]. This agrees with previous results,
which reported that the phase change phenomenon is accompanied by
the structural transformation of silicalite-1 from the less strained
monoclinic phase to the more strained orthorhombic phase.26

Formation Modes
From the above results, formation modes
of the CNF-mediated silicalite-1 are summarized in Figure 5. There exist two different
formation modes in the two routes.

Figure 5 Schematic description of formation processes
of a holed silicalite-1
crystal by route (A) in which CNF and TPABr are preliminarily mixed
and route (B) in which CNF is mixed with the silicalite-1 seeds preliminarily
grown.

In route A, the samples were prepared
by the sequential impregnations
of different amount of CNF with TPABr, NaOH, and tetraehtylorthosilicalite
(TEOS). As shown in Figure S10, CNFs in
aqueous medium are normally negatively charged over a wide pH range
due to dissociation of surface hydroxyl groups, and the ζ-potential
value shifts to the positive side after the addition of TPA+. This indicates intrusion of TPA+ in electrical double
layers of CNF to form TPA+–CNF(−) composite agglomerates. Thus, the interaction between CNF and the
TPA SDA ions before addition of TEOS is beneficial for the growth
of zeolite seeds around the vicinity of the TPA+-attached
CNF. When CNF content is too high, more TPA ions are consumed or localized
on the surface of CNF, due to which their structure-directing role
for the formation of a larger zeolite framework is restricted and
only ill-crystalized or near-amorphous spherical particles are formed.
However, at appropriate CNF content, sufficiently higher TPA+-to-CNF quantity ratio, and longer hydrothermal time, route A does
favor the growth of a perfect framework that closely encompasses CNF
in the interior of its structure. Hence, the holed silicalite-1 with
rich porosity and a larger defect density is formed.

In contrast,
CNF was impregnated with the adequately hydrolyzed
gel precursor in route B, in which the major interaction takes place
between CNF and the intermediate silicate species Si–(O–)x. Since both species
are negatively charged, their interaction is hindered and few CNFs
can be incorporated in the zeolite crystals during crystallization.
Thus, CNF is associated with larger zeolite seeds, eventually resulting
in larger crystal subunits in the holed or cracked crystal particle
such that the crystal particle looks more solid as compared to those
obtained by route A.

The results are also supported by comparing
packing densities of
the powdered samples. As shown in Figure S11, silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96) has the loosest filling state at the
same mass base with the packing density (0.33 g cm–3) reduced to less than the one-half of that of silicalite-1(0) (0.71
g cm–3). In contrast, the route B samples show a
greater packing density (0.38–0.55 g cm–3), revealing the more solid property. Therefore, route A is the more
favorable approach that promotes incorporation of CNF in a zeolite
framework to generate the holed silicalite-1.

Organic Vapor Adsorption
It was revealed recently that
a twin-type crystal particle of silicalite-1 comprised a number of
structural subunits, which join together to build an hourglass-like
internal architecture (Figure S12).32−37 Due to the mismatch of orthorhombic and monoclinic phases and/or
different orientations of main/sinusoidal channels, crystal subunits
and platelets are dislocated to generate a framework defect in the
boundaries, which form intraparticle diffusion barriers to impede
adsorption. In this regard, the CNF-mediated holed silicalite-1 is
favored as the penetrative internal holes or cracks may happen to
break the boundary barriers so as to create multiple short paths for
adsorbate molecules to directly access the micropores of the subunits
from the inside of the crystal. In addition, silanol defects are easily
formed due to the absence of the framework Si usually under alkaline
synthesis conditions (Figure 2).20 The increased amount of hydroxyl
groups by CNF-mediated synthesis possibly causes a more notable influence
toward the adsorption of organic molecules.

To examine the effectiveness
of CNF-mediated silicalite-1, vapor-phase adsorption of MTBE and NDMA
on these materials was evaluated. Figure 6 shows adsorption isotherms of MTBE at 283
and 318 K on the well-crystallized samples. For all of the samples,
the two isotherms measured at two different temperatures are intersected,
meaning that there exist two types of adsorption: one (below the intersection p/p0) is energetically favored
equilibrium adsorption of MTBE at which adsorption is decreased with
the increase of adsorption temperature; the other one (above intersection p/p0) requires activation energy
to occur so that a higher adsorption is achieved at a higher adsorption
temperature. Thus, the adsorption of MTBE on these zeolites is partially
diffusion-determined. It is well known that straight (main) channel,
sinusoidal (side-pocket) channel, and their intersection part are
the three typical adsorption sites in an MFI-type zeolite, in which
the sinusoidal channel is possibly the preferential site for MTBE
having a similar molecular structure and bent molecular configuration
with dimethyl ether.39 Thereby, the comparable
(or slightly larger) molecular size of MTBE with the pore opening
sizes of silicalite-1 (Figure 6) may make it harder to access one part of those adsorption
sites, particularly the main channel or the intersection site. Besides,
crystal distortion, internal silanol deficiencies, and complicated
boundaries between subunits in a crystal particle can be other reasons
for diffusion obstacles depending on synthesis approaches. As the
result, the commercial HSZ(1500) appears to suffer from diffusion
hindrance to the least extent among all of the samples, giving the
largest MTBE adsorption at both adsorption temperatures (Figure 6). In contrast, the
pore structure of silicalite-1(0) does not favor the adsorption of
MTBE irrespective of a similar N2-probed porosity (Table 1). The difference
between the two zeolites is further accountable by their evident structural
distinction, that is, the crystal of HSZ(1500) comprises small square
crystals with monoclinic and more refined orthorhombic phases, whereas,
on the contrary, silicalite-1(0) is a twin-type shaped crystal containing
complicated internal inter-subunit boundaries (Figure S12), which may cause serious diffusion hindrance in
the adsorption of MTBE having a larger molecular size. On the other
hand, it is obvious that the CNF-mediated synthesis indeed largely
improves the adsorption of MTBE, indicating that the donated holes
or cracks can provide short paths for the easier access of MTBE to
the adsorption sites. It appears that the adsorption of MTBE is more
dependent on the synthesis route and the addition amount of CNF rather
than the N2-probed porosity (Table 1). Among all of the synthesized samples,
silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96) from route A (Figure 5(A)) achieves the highest adsorption of MTBE
particularly at the small vapor pressure range at both adsorption
temperatures, implying that its internal crystal structure is excellent
enough for MTBE to overcome diffusion barriers in adsorption.

adsorption temperatures of 318 and 283 K, respectively. The insets
show pore mouth and sizes of the main channel ([010] direction) and
the three-dimensional sizes of MTBE.

Figure 7 shows adsorption
isotherms of NDMA at 283 and 318 K on the well-crystallized samples.
In contrast to those of MTBE, a diffusion-determining type of adsorption
is not observed for NDMA due to a smaller molecular size. However,
the adsorption of NDMA changes more complicatedly with samples. First,
the adsorption of NDMA on silicalite-1(0) becomes very high but inversely
is the lowest on HSZ(1500) at both adsorption temperatures. This implies
that the pore system of silicalite-1(0) becomes available for the
smaller NDMA, whereas factors other than structural ones may work
for pore blockage at the initial adsorption of NDMA for HSZ(1500).
For the latter case, formation of adsorbate clusters either at the
vicinity of pore opening or inside pore channels may be considered
because the more polar NDMA is easier to interact with the internal
silanol defects [or other tiny active centers due to the very little
aluminum residual in HSZ(1500)]. Second, the route A CNF-mediated
silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96) sample still holds a very high adsorption
capacity, showing the highest adsorption particularly at the lower
adsorption temperature. This is again indicative of an excellent internal
crystal structure on which NDMA adsorption is not obstructed. Third,
while the adsorption of NDMA on silicalite-1(0.25-0.1CNF-24) is the
highest of all of the samples at the higher adsorption temperature
(318 K), it is indifferent with that at the lower adsorption temperature
(283 K), suggesting serious diffusion hindrance for the adsorption
of NDMA. However, this does not happen for the silicalite-1(0.25-0.5CNF-24)
sample obtained from the same route B synthesis, indicating that addition
amount of CNF is a tuning factor of the synthesized silicalite-1 regarding
the adsorptivity of NDMA by changing crystal dimension parameters
(Table S2) and the contents of interior
holes and silanol defects. Additionally, synthesis conditions resulting
in the aggregated morphology of small crystals or ill-crystallized
particles do not favor adsorption of NDMA (Figures S14 and S15), confirming that it is the accessible micropores
in a well-crystallized silicalite-1 that serve as effective sites
for the adsorption of NDMA.

silicalite-1(0) (●, ○), silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96) (blue
■, blue □), and silicalite-1(0.25-xCNF-24) with x = 0.1 (green ▲, green Δ)
and 0.5 (⧫, ◊). Adsorption temperatures are 318 and
283 K for filled and unfilled marks, respectively. The insets show
pore mouth and sizes of the sinusoidal (side-pocket) channel ([100]
direction) and the three-dimensional sizes of NDMA.

To understand the adsorption process of NDMA more comprehensively,
the isosteric enthalpy of adsorption of NDMA, ΔHiso,NDMA, was calculated by the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation.30,31 As shown in Figure 8, except for several peak areas, the values
of ΔHiso,NDMA of all of the samples
are smaller than the liquefaction enthalpy of NDMA (ΔHliq,NDMA) in the whole adsorption range. This
indicates that NDMA molecules receive a very weak adsorption potential
in the zeolite pores due to a weaker adsorbate–adsorbent interaction
as compared to intermolecular interaction in liquid NDMA. All samples
show an increased ΔHiso,NDMA with
NDMA adsorption at the initial adsorption stage (<5–10 mL
STP g–1), characteristic of the enhanced interadsorbate
interaction in zeolitic micropores. The ΔHiso,NDMA of HSZ(1500) reaches a summit (∼39.9 kJ mol–1) at a very small loading of NDMA (∼2.8 mL
STP g–1), following which it decreases gradually
to a flat stage at 22 kJ mol–1. This evidences cluster
formation of the NDMA adsorbates in pores at the very early stage,
which possibly impedes the access of the successive NDMA molecules
to the internal zeolite pores. On the other hand, no initial peaks
of ΔHiso,NDMA are observed for other
samples, which, however, do show different levels of adsorption energy
at a loading of NDMA below ∼30 mL STP g–1. While ΔHiso,NDMA in this stage
approaches a flat area at 31 and 22 kJ mol–1, respectively,
for silicalite-1(0) and silicalite-1(0.25-0.5CNF-24), it keeps constant
first at a higher value (35.4 kJ mol–1) and then
gradually decreases to a second flat stage at 31 kJ mol–1 for silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96). It seems reasonable that the different
levels of adsorption energy correspond to adsorption of NDMA at different
adsorption sites in these zeolites, that is, the main (straight) channel,
the sinusoidal (zigzag) channel, and the intersections that they cross.
It was reported that preferential adsorption sites in silicalite-1
are dependent on the unique properties of each adsorbate (polarity,
linear or bending shape, etc.),38−42 and more investigations are thus required to identify which one
of the three adsorption sites is the most energetically favorable
or unfavorable for NDMA to be occupied. Nevertheless, the results
of the isosteric enthalpy of NDMA strongly support that route A CNF-mediated
silicalite-1(2CNF-0.75-96) possesses a very beneficial internal crystal
structure for the adsorption of NDMA because its energetically favored
adsorption sites are the most easily accessible for NDMA. The reasons
contributing to the minimum hindrance can be not only donation of
holed or cracked internal structures but also the proportionally reduced
twin-type crystal size (Table S1) and formation
of smaller crystal subunits (Figures 3 and 5). On the other hand,
the difference in adsorption energies of silicalite-1(0) and silicalite-1(0.25-0.5CNF-24)
is accountable by their differences in crystal shape parameters (Table S1) and internal silanol defect content,
which determine the kind of adsorption site to be occupied by NDMA
and different adsorption behaviors of NDMA and MTBE. At the higher
loading of NDMA (>∼30 mL STP g–1), all
of
the synthesized samples show a peak change in ΔHiso,NDMA, characteristic of phase changes of adsorbates
in micropores. The phenomenon is corresponding to the step changes
in the desorption branch of their adsorption isotherms (Figures S13–S15) and is associated with
the framework structure change from the less strained monoclinic phase
to the more strained orthorhombic phase.26 This can be confirmed also by comparing XRD patterns before and
after adsorption [Figure S16B–G].
In contrast, the phenomenon is more gradual and not as evident for
HSZ(1500) (Figures S13a and S16A) as for
the synthesized samples. This is further indicative of pore blockage
of this sample at the initial adsorption stage, which hinders smooth
access of NDMA to other parts of adsorption sites so as hardly to
cause the phase change of adsorbates at the higher NDMA loading.

Conclusions
CNF
with nanosized diameter, high aspect ratio, and rich surface
hydroxyl groups is proved to be either an excellent emulsifier to
obtain uniform and smaller crystal particles or an appropriate mesopore/macropore
template depending on synthesis routes and conditions. Route A, which
preliminarily mixes CNF with SDA species with an appropriate addition
of CNF, promotes the formation of CNF–SDA ion composite structures
around which the primary silicate ions are formed and zeolite crystals
are subsequently grown. This eventually leads to silicalite-1 with
a unique internal holed structure containing mesoporosity and larger
pores after the release of CNF. Route B, allowing contact of CNF with
silicate–SDA ion seeds, brings about smaller, uniform, well-crystallized
but less holed particles and modifies the growth direction of the
silicalite-1 crystal.

Besides formation of holes or cracks in
a crystal particle, the
existence of CNF also modifies the crystal systems of the framework
structure in the formed silicalite-1. The orthorhombic part of a silicalite-1
crystal is more likely compartmented near the surface of CNF relative
to the monoclinic part and thus adjacent to the surface of the internal
holes or cracks for the well-crystallized silicalite-1 sample synthesized
by route A.

The content of holes or cracks in a crystal particle
plays an important
role in overcoming adsorption hindrance to achieve enhanced adsorption
because it determines the effectiveness of eliminating diffusion barriers
between crystal subunits and platelets. The CNF-mediated holed silicalite-1
by route A possesses an internal crystal structure beneficial for
the easy access of adsorbate molecules to energetically preferential
adsorption sites, leading to a great adsorption toward both MTBE and
NDMA. This becomes possible due to the smaller (proportionally reduced)
twin-type crystal size and smaller crystal subunits in addition to
the favored short path from internal holes or cracks.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) and tetraehtylorthosilicalite
(TEOS) of special grades and 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution
for volumetric analysis were from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co.
Home-made CNF prepared from commercial cellulose powder (KC Flock
W-400, Nippon Paper Chemicals Co., Ltd.) was used. In the preparation
of CNF, cellulose powder of 5 wt % was soaked overnight in water and
was fibrillated by repeating disk-milling using a super mass colloider
(MKCA6-2, Masuko Sangyo Co. Ltd.) at 1800 rpm until a diameter below
tens of nanometers.43 The obtained nanosized
CNF was confirmed to have a diameter distribution in the range of
20–60 nm by electron microscopic observations.44 A commercial MFI-type zeolite (commercial name: HSZ-890HOA),
represented as HSZ(1500), was supplied by Tosoh Co., whose SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio was as high as 1500
and was used as a reference material.

Synthesis of Holed Silicalite-1
CNF-mediated synthesis
of holed silicalite-1 was carried out at the usual synthesis conditions
for pure silicalite-145 but under co-existence
of CNF. The pure silicalite-1 without addition of CNF, represented
as silicalite-1(0), was synthesized at a molar composition of 0.08
NaOH:0.25 TPABr:1 SiO2:11 H2O, where TPABr was
used as the SDA species. In a typical synthesis for silicalite-1(0),
2.96 g of TPABr was mixed with 3.55 mL of 1 M NaOH and 5.27 mL of
deionized water (D.W.) and the mixture was magnetically stirred at
room temperature (RT) for 20 min. After addition of 9.27 g of TEOS,
the mixture was stirred at RT for 24 h and then subjected to hydrothermal
treatment at 423 K for 24 h. The bottom precipitates were collected
by filtration, thoroughly washed with D.W. to neutral pH, and dried
at 353 K overnight. After pyrolysis at 823 K in air for 3 h, silicalite-1(0)
was obtained.

For the CNF-added synthesis of silicalite-1, CNF
was mixed with the synthesis solution for silicalite-1 as an additional
component in two different manners. In route A, TPABr was first mixed
with a certain amount of CNF solution, to which NaOH was added. The
other procedures and conditions were exactly the same as those for
silicalite-1(0). The synthesis was carried out at a molar composition
of 0.08 NaOH:y TPABr:1 SiO2:11 H2O with x wt % CNF (vs SiO2) added. The
parameters x, y, and the hydrothermal
treatment time (t) were varied in the synthesis.
The obtained zeolites were represented as silicalite-1(xCNF-y-t). In route B, preliminary
hydrolysis of TEOS was allowed before mixing with CNF solution. Typically,
TEOS was first added into the mixture of TPABr, NaOH, and water at
the same molar ratio as that for silicalite-1(0). After continuous
stirring at RT for 4 h, x wt % CNF (vs SiO2) was added and the mixture was further stirred at RT for 20 h. The
solution was then subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 423 K for
24 h, following which the same procedures and conditions were applied
as those for silicalite-1(0). The obtained zeolites were represented
as silicalite-1(0.25-xCNF-24) with only x varied in the synthesis.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of
samples were measured by a Rigaku SmartLab-type X-ray diffractometer
at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm).
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
spectrum 100 Optica type spectrometer, which was equipped with an
attenuated total reflection (ATR) attachment having an MKII Golden
Gate TM single reflection system consisting of a diamond crystal 45°
top plate, a sapphire anvil, and an Optics Unit with ZnSe lenses.
FT-IR spectra were also recorded by the KBr-transmission method on
a Nicolet NEXUS-470 type spectrometer [under a continuous purge of
N2 gas (99.99%)] to achieve higher resolution in the range
of 2500–4000 cm–1. Samples (5 wt %) were
mixed with KBr (Wako, special grade) to prepare pellets for the measurements.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on either a Hitachi
S-4300 type field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at
an acceleration voltage of 5 kV or a JSM-6010LA type microscope at
an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. N2 adsorption isotherms
were measured at 77 K on a Belmax volumetric apparatus made MicrotracBEL
Co. All of the samples were evacuated at 523 K for 5 h before adsorption
measurements. The values of specific surface area, SBET; micropore volume, Vmicro; and total pore volume, Vtotal were
calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method
at p/p0 < 0.1, the
Dubinin–Radushkevich method based on the micropore filling
mechanism, and N2 adsorption amount at p/p0 = 0.95, respectively.28,29 The subtraction of Vtotal and Vmicro, Vsb, gives
either mesopore or macropore volume or both, which was judged by the
shape of isotherms.

Organic Vapor Adsorption
Vapor phase
adsorption of
MTBE and NDMA was carried out using the same volumetric apparatus
in the temperature range of 283–313 K. Before adsorption, samples
were degassed sufficiently at RT (usually overnight) and further at
523 K for 3 h. The isosteric enthalpy of adsorption of NDMA, ΔHiso,NDMA, was calculated by the Clausius–Clapeyron
equation28,29 from the adsorption isotherms at 283 and
313 K.
