Mg-substituted ZnO nanoparticles
(MgZnO NPs) were synthesized by
a soft chemical approach and were well-characterized by X-ray diffraction,
transmission electron microscopy, UV–visible spectroscopy,
and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The absorption and photoluminescence
spectra show that substitution of Mg ions results in the widening
of the band gap and a significant enhancement in the concentration
of defects in ZnO NPs. A systemic study of generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) under dark, daylight, and visible light conditions
suggests that the aqueous suspension of MgZnO NPs generates a higher
level of ROS because of the surface defects (oxygen vacancies). This
capability of MgZnO NPs makes them a more promising candidate for
the inhibition of bacterial growth and for killing of cancer cells
as compared to pure ZnO NPs, possibly because of the enhanced interaction
and accumulation of MgZnO NPs in the cytoplasm or cell membrane in
the presence of both Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions. Further,
MgZnO NPs exhibit excellent selective killing of nasopharyngeal carcinoma
cells (KB) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) with minimal toxicity
to normal fibroblast cells (L929). The results suggest that the generation
of ROS and Zn2+ ions are possibly responsible for the higher
activity toward the depolarization of cell membrane potential, the
lipid peroxidation in bacterial cells, depolarization of the mitochondrial
membrane, and cell cycle arrest in the S phase in cancer cells.

1 Introduction
Uniqueness
of metal oxide nanomaterials due to their boosted optical
properties finds interesting research areas. These nanomaterials possess
potential for a wide range of applications such as optoelectronics,
solar energy, sensors, and biomedical fields.1−9 Several metal oxides such as ZnO, TiO2, and Fe2O3 are exploited in a variety of areas, especially for
photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, inhibition of bacteria,
and killing of cancer cells.10−13 Amongst semiconductor materials, ZnO is found to
be more versatile and is considered to be a potential material for
next-generation biomedicine as an antibacterial and anticancer agent.4−6 Its high redox potential, chemical stability, and higher surface
reactivity make it more attractive for a wide range of applications,
especially for biomedical applications.1,8 Li et al. proved
that ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) are more effective
for bacterial growth inhibition in comparison to other oxides NPs.14 They also showed that ZnO and TiO2 NPs are more prone to generate reactive oxygen species than other
oxide nanomaterials. Recent studies demonstrate that ZnO is not only
effectively used as the antibacterial agent for various microorganisms
but also widely explored as an anticancer agent for cancer theranostics
both in the absence and in the presence of UV and visible light.4,9,13,15−21 A general perception about ZnO is that it gets easily internalized
with the cells via electrostatic interaction and generates enough
reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing cell death.22−24 ROS is effective
even in dark conditions.22,25,26 Another reason attributed to its antibacterial and anticancer activities
is the release of Zn2+ ions, which penetrate the cells
and damage cellular components such as DNA and proteins and hence
are toxic to the cells causing cell death. Lipovsky et al. and Xu
et al. reported the ROS generation, even in the dark, as evident by
electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. They suggested that the
surface defects played a vital role in the generation of ROS in the
presence as well as in the absence of light.25,26 Recently, Prasanna and Vijayaraghavan also reported the generation
of ROS in the aqueous suspension of ZnO in dark.27 However, the factors responsible for ROS generation in
ZnO in the dark condition and release of Zn2+ ions are
still unknown. Very few studies reported the effect of defects on
the generation of ROS and their role in the antibacterial and anticancer
properties.28−30 Herein, we propose the mechanism of ROS generation
and dissolution of Zn2+ using Mg ions as substituents in
ZnO NPs. Mg is an essential element for biological systems, which
regulates various biochemical reactions in the body through its role
as enzyme cofactors. Its deficiency is carcinogenic. A high level
of magnesium inhibits carcinogenesis in the case of solid tumors.31 Also, magnesium and its alloys are widely used
as temporary implants, such as orthopedic implants and cardiovascular
stents, suggesting its biocompatible nature.32 Therefore, we synthesized Mg-substituted ZnO NPs by a soft chemical
approach, which are henceforth referred in the text as MgZnO NPs.
The consequence of substitution of Mg ions on the optical and photochemical
properties is discussed. Specifically, we have explored the defect
concentration in MgZnO NPs and its effect on the generation of ROS
under dark, daylight, and visible light at ambient condition and its
potential outcome on bacterial inhibition as well as cancer therapy.
For antibacterial study, we used Escherichia coli as model bacteria, whereas for the anticancer study, three different
cell lines, namely, normal fibroblast cell (L929), cervical cancer
cell (HeLa), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell (KB) lines were chosen.
MgZnO NPs exhibit a defect-mediated ROS generation and toxicity for
bacteria and cancer cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Microstructural Analysis of
ZnO and MgZnO NPs
Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of ZnO
and MgZnO NPs, which exhibit a single-phase hexagonal wurtzite structure
without any additional peaks. MgZnO NPs show slightly shifted peaks
toward lower angles, indicating the expansion of the unit cell on
the substitution of Mg2+ into the ZnO matrix at the Zn2+ site. The intensities of all diffraction peaks decrease
and slightly broaden. From this broadening, the estimated average
crystallite size is found to be 10 and 7 nm (σ = 10%) for ZnO
and MgZnO NPs, respectively, using Debye–Scherrer formula.
The decrease in the crystallite size is mainly attributed to the presence
of Mg ions, which hinders the growth of crystal grains.29 The shifting and broadening of XRD lines in
ZnO NPs on Mg ion substitution strongly suggest that Mg ions are successfully
substituted into the ZnO structure at the Zn2+ site. The
presence of Mg ions in ZnO is also analyzed by inductively coupled
plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis, which also confirm the existence of Mg in the ZnO
matrix (Table S1, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the crystallite size and lattice strain for different
crystallographic orientations (101), (002), and (100) were calculated
and are depicted in Table 1.

mode, (c) Higher resolution mode, and (d) diffraction pattern of MgZnO
NPs.

MgZnO	8.1	7.0	8.3	1.49	1.77	1.29	
As said earlier, the crystallite
sizes of ZnO and MgZnO NPs are
estimated as 10 and 7 nm (σ = ±10%), respectively. To support
this, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to find
the actual visual size of MgZnO NPs. Figure 1b shows the TEM micrograph, whereas Figure 1c gives the high-resolution
TEM (high-resolution mode) image for MgZnO NPs. Spherical particles
with an average size of about 7–8 nm are observed, indicating
that the size of NPs is slightly affected by the substitution of Mg
ions. TEM micrographs of ZnO are provided in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The average interfringe
distances of ZnO and MgZnO NPs are measured to be ∼0.26 and
0.29 nm, respectively.

2.2 Absorption and Photoluminescence
Spectra of
MgZnO NPs
Figure 2a shows the absorption spectra of ZnO and MgZnO NPs. The absorption
edge shifted toward lower wavelengths (blue shift) with the incorporation
of Mg2+ ions in ZnO. The band gap energies of the ZnO and
MgZnO NPs were estimated to be 3.32 and 3.44 eV, respectively. It
reveals that the substitution of Mg2+ ions in ZnO can enhance
the absorption spectral range and alter the band gap of ZnO. This
blue shift in the absorption in MgZnO NPs can be ascribed to the Moss–Burstein
band filling effect.28,33 The Fermi level of ZnO is located
inside the conduction band, whereas in the case of MgZnO NPs, it gets
shifted toward the higher level of the conduction band. This increase
may lift the Fermi level into the conduction band and result in a
widening of the band gap.

Figure 2 (a) UV–visible absorption and (b) PL
spectra of ZnO and
MgZnO NPs at room temperature.

Figure 2b
shows
the photoluminescence (PL) results of ZnO and MgZnO NPs. Two bands
were observed in both ZnO and MgZnO NPs. The first band in the UV
region is known as near band emission (NBE), and the other band in
the visible region is known as defect emission band. The PL spectra
exhibit a broad emission peak with a maximum intensity in the yellow
emission centered around 590 and 570 nm for ZnO and MgZnO NPs, respectively.
It is believed that the yellow-orange emission is related to the defects
consisting of oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitials.34,35 This broad emission band partly extends into green and mostly in
the yellow and red spectral regions. This could be attributed to the
transition of excited photoelectrons from the defect level to the
valence level. These emissions are usually due to the presence of
structural defects and impurities. As Mg ions are incorporated in
ZnO, the NBE peak shifts to a lower region. This blue shift of NBE
could be understood on the basis of Burstein–Moss effect. This
was also observed in other semiconductors such as silicon- and germanium-doped
GaN, Al-doped ZnO, and iodine-doped PbTe.33,36,37 PL spectroscopy also provides sufficient
information about the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers,
charge carrier trapping, their recombination kinetics, and surface
states.38 Previously, it was reported that
the intensity of defect emission strongly influences the photocatalytic
activity of ZnO.38−40 The shift in the NBE of MgZnO NPs as compared to
ZnO is ascribed to the efficient charge separation between charge
carriers due to the band gap widening.

2.3 Detection
of ROS in MgZnO NPs
It
was reported previously that the surface defects such as oxygen vacancies
(oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen defects) are the main factors
responsible for ROS generation.25,27 Xu et al. and Guo et
al. suggested that oxygen vacancies on the surface of ZnO help to
generate ROS.26,41 Similarly, Krishnamoorthy et
al. reported the generation of ROS in MgO due to the presence of defects
or oxygen vacancies at the surface of NPs.42 It was observed from the PL spectra that the surface defects are
more in MgZnO NPs as compared to ZnO, and therefore, MgZnO NPs exhibit
higher active sites, leading to higher ROS. Therefore, ROS level in
MgZnO NPs in aqueous suspension was estimated by fluorescence and
absorbance spectroscopies and ESR using terephthalic acid as a hydroxyl
radical probe, nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) as a superoxide radical
probe, and spin probe 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) as a singlet
oxygen probe.6,43 These results show that MgZnO
NPs are able to generate a higher level of ROS in dark, daylight,
and visible light at ambient condition (Figure 3), which makes MgZnO NPs more promising materials
for biological applications, especially for the inhibition of microorganisms
and cancer therapy. Figure 3a–c shows the UV–visible absorbance spectra
of NBT in the aqueous suspension of MgZnO NPs under dark, daylight,
and visible light at ambient condition with different time intervals.
It was observed that the characteristic absorption peak of NBT at
259 nm shows a slight decrease with time in dark conditions. On the
other hand, the peak at 259 nm decreases and its decrease further
increases in visible light irradiation with time. The degradation
of NBT suggests that MgZnO NPs are able to generate a sufficient amount
of •O2– radicals under
ambient condition and its amount increases with the irradiation of
light. Again, •OH radicals were also detected by
fluorescence spectroscopy. Figure 3 shows the typical fluorescence spectra of TAOH under
(d) dark condition, (e) daylight, and (f) visible light irradiation
at ambient condition. The fluorescence results indicate a significant
increase in the fluorescence intensity within 15 min, even in the
dark condition (Figure 3d), depicting the spontaneous production of hydroxyl radicals. Further
increase in the fluorescence intensity is observed under daylight
(room light) and visible light at ambient condition, suggesting the
increment in the production of more hydroxyl radicals (Figure 3e,f). Similarly, generation
of singlet oxygen was also observed in the ESR spectra of TEMP with
MgZnO NPs (Figure 3g). The ROS detection results suggest that MgZnO NPs are capable
of producing hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and singlet oxygen.

MgZnO NPs under dark, daylight, and visible light at ambient condition.

2.4 Antibacterial
Activity of ZnO and MgZnO NPs
The antibacterial effect of
ZnO and MgZnO NPs was investigated
by using culture turbidity as a qualitative measure of cell growth,
plate counting assay, and FACS analysis. Figure 4A shows the growth inhibition curve of E. coli on treatment with different concentrations
of MgZnO NPs. It was observed that with increasing concentrations
of MgZnO NPs, the bacterial growth is suppressed as compared to the
untreated bacterial cells. The growth of E. coli is completely inhibited on treatment with 400 μg/mL MgZnO
NPs, which is known as minimum bacterial concentration. The minimum
inhibitory concentration for MgZnO NPs was found to be 12.5 μg/mL.
Similarly, the antibacterial effect of ZnO and MgZnO NPs is also evident
by the reduction in viability of E. coli in nutrient broth on treatment with the different concentrations
of ZnO and MgZnO NPs for 2 h by plate counting assay and shown in Figure 4B.

Figure 4 (A) Growth inhibition
curve of E. coli in the presence of
MgZnO NPs, (B) bacterial viability on treatment
with ZnO and MgZnO NPs in nutrient broth media, and (C) flow cytometric
analysis of E. coli control and treated
with 400 and 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs for 2 h. E. coli was stained with a mixture of SYTO 9 and PI.

Further, the antibacterial behavior of MgZnO NPs is further
assessed
by the FACS analysis of bacterial cells treated with NPs and stained
with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI) as a nucleic acid stain. The
former gives green fluorescence, whereas the latter gives red fluorescence.
Both dyes have different spectral characteristics and have different
penetration abilities to healthy bacterial cells. More specifically,
SYTO 9 generally stains all bacteria with intact membranes and with
damaged membranes. In contrast to this, PI penetrates only damaged
bacterial cell membranes. Therefore, fluorescence of SYTO 9 reduces
when both dyes are present. Figure 4C shows the flow cytometric analysis of E. coli (a) control and (b–e) treated with
400 to 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs for 2 h. The flow cytometric results
show the decrease in the green fluorescence (82.5−48.4%) with
the increase of the red fluorescence (17.5–51.6%) as the concentration
of MgZnO NPs varies from 50 to 400 μg/mL. This suggests that
bacterial cells are present more in the dead phase on treatment with
MgZnO NPs.

2.5 ROS Detection by 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate and TBARS Assay
Toxicity of both ZnO and MgZnO
NPs may arise because of the generation of ROS and release of Zn2+ ions. The generation of ROS is mainly due to the strong
interaction between NPs and cells and higher defect concentration.
Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows
the (a) ROS generation and (b) Malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalent after
treatment with different concentrations of ZnO and MgZnO NPs. This result suggests that MgZnO NPs generate more ROS as compared
to ZnO NPs. To confirm the ROS-mediated antibacterial effect of these
NPs, the growth patterns of E. coli on treatment with 400 μg/mL MgZnO NPs in the presence of antioxidants
were analyzed. It was thought that the ROS is generated due to the
strong interaction of MgZnO NPs with E. coli, which could be scavenged by the antioxidants and release of Zn2+ ions. In this regard, we studied the effect of Zn2+ ions and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) toward the inhibition
of antibacterial activity of MgZnO NPs. NAC is a well-known scavenger
of hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen. The inhibition of the bacterial
growth was studied with an equivalent amount of Zn2+ ions
present in 400 μg of MgZnO NPs with different concentrations
of NAC in culture medium (Figure S3a,b, Supporting Information). This study suggests that the antibacterial activity
is due to the release of Zn2+ from MgZnO NPs when they
come in contact with the cell membranes. The cell membrane having
negative charge mutually attracts positively charged Zn2+ which penetrates into the cell membrane. Another reason is the generation
of a higher amount of ROS, which is reflected in the inhibition in
the growth curve with the increase in the concentration of NAC from
1 to 8 mg/mL. Growth inhibition of E coli was not much observed with increasing concentration of NAC, suggesting
the scavenging of ROS generated during interaction of NPs with bacterial
cells in culture media.

2.6 TEM Analysis of E. coli
Further, to analyze the interaction
of NPs and their impact
on the cell membrane potential, TEM analysis was performed and changes
in the cell membrane potential were investigated. Figure 5 shows the TEM image of E. coli (a) without treatment and (b) after treatment
with MgZnO NPs. The TEM micrographs clearly show the strong interaction
and internalization of NPs on the surface of E. coli and inside the bacterial cells. This might damage the cell membrane
and make it porous for internalization of NPs in cells, which is also
observed as a change in the membrane potential (Figure S4, Supporting Information). This strong interaction
between the NPs and the cell wall of E. coli is due to the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides and positively
charged Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions, which may allow
the NPs to enter inside the cells and enable the breakdown of the
cell wall of E. coli.

and (b) after treatment with MgZnO NPs for 4 h (scale bar: (a) 1 μm
and (b) 500 nm).

2.7 Anticancer
Behavior of ZnO and MgZnO NPs
Having seen a strong antibacterial
activity of MgZnO NPs, it was
thought worthwhile to investigate the anticancer activity, which was
explored using KB, HeLa, and L929 cells by performing SRB and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. A study on the mechanistic toxicity of
ZnO and MgZnO NPs against cancer cells and normal cells reveals some
unusual features of these materials. Figure 6 displays the cytotoxicity of ZnO and MgZnO
NPs against cancer cells and normal cells. No obvious toxicity of
ZnO and MgZnO NPs against normal fibroblast cells (L929) is observed,
even at higher concentrations of ZnO (100 μg/mL), as shown in Figure 6c. However, these
are more sensitive to the cancerous cells, as is evident from the
cytotoxicity study in KB and HeLa cells, shown in Figure 6a,b. The IC50 values
of MgZnO NPs against HeLa and KB cells were found to be 25 and 50
μg/mL, respectively, after 24 h of exposure. Further, investigating
the interaction of particles with the plasma membrane permeability
through LDH assay gives the basic mechanistic difference between the
toxicity of MgZnO NPs toward cancer cells versus normal cells. Basically,
LDH leakage is related to disruption of the plasma membrane. Figure 6d shows the level
of LDH leakage from normal cells (L929) and cancer cells (KB) treated
with different concentrations of MgZnO NPs. However, after 24 h, the
cancer cells release about 2–4 times more LDH as compared to
normal cells. It was observed that L929 cells remained intact with
no significant leakage of LDH. The morphological changes and loss
in membrane integrity on treatment with MgZnO NPs are clearly seen
by optical microscopy. Figure S5a–d (Supporting Information) shows the phase contrast images of L929 and KB
cells treated with 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs for 24 h. It can be seen
that L929 treated with MgZnO NPs retained normal morphology before
and after the treatment (Figure S5a,b, Supporting Information). On the other hand, KB cells exhibit a stressed
rounded morphology with a granular cytoplasm and loss among cells
at a similar concentration of MgZnO NPs (Figure S5d, Supporting Information).

cells, and (c) L929 cells
and (d) LDH release by KB and L929 cells in culture medium after treatment
with MgZnO NPs for 24 h.

2.8 ROS Detection in KB Cells
As mentioned
above, the NPs show toxicity toward biological systems by their ability
to excite the generation of ROS, which develops the oxidative stress
and finally leads to cell death. To determine the ROS, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and confocal microscopy were performed. Figure 7a,b shows the generation
of ROS using DCFH-DA dye by fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal
image of KB cells. The ROS generation in L929 cells is much less as
compared to that in KB cells. From the confocal images, the presence
of the green fluorescence in the cells shows intracellular ROS due
to the formation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). This might be attributed to the interaction and internalization
of NPs, which is higher in the KB cells as compared to the L929 cells.
The cell walls of cancer cells are more permeable and get disintegrated
as compared to the L929 cells, which helps to enhance the particle
internalization.

and (b) corresponding
confocal image of KB cells.

2.9 Apoptotic Cell Analysis of L929 and KB Cells
Apoptotic cells are analyzed by FACS analysis using FITC-Annexin
and PI staining after treatment with MgZnO NPs. Figure 8A shows FACS analysis of L929 cells: (a)
control cells without any treatment and (b,c) cells treated with 25
and 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs. The FACS results show that only 6.2%
cells undergo the apoptotic state on treatment with 50 μg/mL
MgZnO NPs and 85.2% cells are alive. L929 cells without any treatment
show that 94.3% cells are alive and only 5% cells are in the early
apoptotic state. On the other hand, KB cells on treatment with the
same concentration shows that ∼88.4% cells are in the apoptotic
state and only 5.8% cells are alive, as shown in Figure 8B(a–c). These results
show that KB cells are more prone to apoptosis as compared to L929
cells after 24 h of exposure.

V-FITC and PI staining of cells. (a) Control and (b,c) L929 cells

24 h. (B) Flow cytogram representing apoptosis assay based on Annexin
V-FITC and PI staining of cells: (a) control and (b,c) KB cells treated
with 25 and 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs, respectively, for 24 h.

2.10 Effect
of MgZnO NPs on the Mitochondrial
Membrane Potential of KB and L929 Cells
Apoptotic cells are
further investigated by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP) of L929 cells and KB cells after treatment with MgZnO NPs using
a JC-10 dye and analyzed by FACS, fluorescence spectroscopy, and confocal
microspectroscopy. Figure S6a,b (Supporting Information) shows the mitochondrial membrane potential of L929 cells using
JC-10 dye. For L929 cells, even after treatment with 50 μg/mL
MgZnO NPs for 24 h, ∼ 94.5% cells (P2 region) retained MMP
(Figure S6a, Supporting Information), whereas
in the case of cancer cells, ∼ 82.3% cells (P3 region) showed
depolarized mitochondria with the same concentration of MgZnO NPs
(Figure 9b). Similarly,
depolarization of mitochondria on treatment with MgZnO NPs is also
confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The marked decrease in MMP
is evident by a shift in JC-10 fluorescence from red to green. It
was observed that 66.7% of cells undergo a change to a depolarized
state on treatment with 25 μg/mL MgZnO NPs as compared to the
control cells (Figure 9c). Control cells show red fluorescence of JC-10 aggregates, whereas
the apoptotic cells show green fluorescence of JC-10 monomers. Thus,
the cells treated with MgZnO NPs exhibit an increase in the bright
green fluorescence with a marked decrease in the red fluorescence,
indicating a loss of MMP. Similarly, Figure S7A (Supporting Information) shows the confocal image of control
KB cells without any treatment, which exhibit only red fluorescence
with very small green fluorescence. Figure S7B (Supporting Information) shows the confocal images of KB cells
after treatment with 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs: (a) bright field, (b)
red fluorescence, and (c) green fluorescence images. On treatment
with MgZnO NPs, the confocal image of KB cells shows the depolarized
membrane potential and more green fluorescence with very less red
fluorescence. However, no such effect was observed in the control
KB cells. This, therefore, suggests that MgZnO NPs destabilize the
MMP in cancer cells because of the generation of ROS and release of
Zn2+ ions.44−46 Further, the dissolution of ZnO and MgZnO NPs at
two different pHs (5.4 and 7.4) incubated at 37 °C for 24 h was
analyzed by ICP-AES analysis (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The dissolution assay of ZnO and MgZnO NPs revealed
∼80 and 100% of Zn2+ ions at pH 5.4, whereas ∼17
and 40% of Zn2+ ions were observed at a normal pH of 7.4
for ZnO and MgZnO NPs. These results suggest that both MgZnO and ZnO
NPs released Zn2+ ions. However, release of Zn2+ ions is more in MgZnO NPs as compared to ZnO NPs. Metal ion dissolution,
in the present case, is more prominent because of the high surface
reactivity of the NPs. Thus, MgZnO NPs change the membrane potential
of cancer cells and force them to undergo apoptosis.

indicates cells with polarized mitochondrial membrane, whereas P3
scatter region (green dots) denotes cells with depolarized mitochondrial
membrane. (c) Change in red/green ratio on treatment with different
concentrations of ZnO and MgZnO NPs.

2.11 Cell Cycle Analysis of L929 and KB Cells
Cell cycle progression of KB and L929 cells was analyzed by the
DNA contents after treatment with MgZnO NPs. Cell cycle is usually
divided into to three main parts: gap1 (G1), S phase, and the G2 phase.
Thus, the toxic effect of MgZnO NPs was further obvious for the cell
cycle analysis to find out cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. The influence
of MgZnO NPs on the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Figure 10A shows the cell
cycle analysis of L929 cells: (a) control, (b) treated with 25 and
(c) 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs. Cell cycle of L929 cells is not much
affected by MgZnO NPs. Figure 10B shows the cell cycle of KB cells (a) control without
any treatment and on treatment with two different concentrations (b)
25 and (c) 50 μg/mL MgZnO NPs for 24 h. From the cell cycle
analysis, it was observed that cell population in the S phase increases
as compared to the control in KB cells, showing a concentration-dependent
S phase arrest. However, the major cell population is observed in
the G1 phase in the KB controls, whereas a decrease in G1 population
accompanied by an increase in the S phase population is detected in
MgZnO NP-treated KB cells. The proportion of cells in the G2/M phase
is less affected as compared to the S phase population. On the other
hand, no such effect has been observed in the L929 cells after the
treatment with the same composition, concentration, and time. Specifically,
MgZnO NPs strongly interact with the cancer cells and produce oxidative
stress due to the generation of ROS and depolarization of the mitochondrial
membrane, leading to apoptosis. The present study suggests that the
presence of defect states/surface oxygen vacancies on the surface
of MgZnO NPs is responsible for the overall mechanism of cell death
in bacteria and cancer cells.

3 Summary
Defect-enriched MgZnO NPs were
demonstrated here as an antibacterial
and anticancer agent. Characterization results from PL and ROS detection
indicate the existence of defects in MgZnO NPs, leading to the more
ROS generation. Moreover, the high surface defects of MgZnO NPs exhibit
more surface-active sites for higher ROS generation and are responsible
for the inhibition of bacterial growth and killing of cancer cells
as compared to ZnO NPs. The antibacterial studies show that MgZnO
NPs interact strongly with the cell wall of E. coli, make the cell membrane permeable, and oxidize the membrane lipid.
It was also observed that MgZnO NPs are more toxic to cancer cells
than to normal cells.

4 Materials and Methods
MgZnO NPs were synthesized by refluxing 50 mM zinc acetate dehydrate
and NaOH. After the competition of the reaction, the solution was
cooled down to room temperature, and the resulting precipitates were
washed several times with Milli-Q water and acetone. The samples were
dried at 80 °C for further characterizations. Details of all
