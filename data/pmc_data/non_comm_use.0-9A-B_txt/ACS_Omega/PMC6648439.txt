We
report an extensive study on the coordination behavior of chiral
ditopic bridging ligands, which lead to metallosupramolecular polymers
in the presence of Zn(II) and Cu(II) in solution. With the help of
UV–vis and circular dichroism spectroscopies, we show that
the metallopolymer sequence can be controlled by chirality and by
the choice of the metal ion. Although the formation of a block metallopolymer
proceeds through the assembly of homoleptic complexes, an alternate
metallopolymer may be obtained only when heteroleptic complexes are
formed. This demonstrates how the prevalent coordination geometries
at metal centers may be used to control the sequences of the metallopolymers.

==== Body
Introduction
Metallo-supramolecular
polymers are highly attractive materials,
especially compared with their covalent counterparts.1,2 They have been investigated in a broad variety of applications and
some are now emerging in various fields including nanoelectronics,
catalysis, controlled release, information storage, or sensing.3,4 Most of these polymers are usually obtained by a simple self-assembly
process between a metal ion and a monomer that has ligand units placed
at both ends. Typical ligands of choice are multidentate ligands such
as bipyridine, terpyridine, or 2,6-bis-(1′-methylbenzimidazolyl)pyridine,
and a broad range of metal ions have been used (Fe2+, Zn2+, La2+, Co2+, etc.).2 Variations in the conformation and length of the organic
core employed to connect the ligands along with choices of the metal
salt are being actively pursued currently to confer new properties
to the resulting metallopolymers.

Nevertheless, this methodology
relies upon interactions between
a single binding pattern and a metal ion and, as a consequence, suffers
from a lack of diversity. The development of new materials with emerging
properties implies the ability to generate complex molecular systems
in a controlled manner. With the aforementioned metallopolymers, we
may introduce interesting additional levels of complexity by introducing
several monomers giving rise to a dynamic combinatorial library.5,6 However, the spontaneous formation of metallo-supramolecular copolymers
makes it a challenging task to develop some form of control over the
assembly process.7 For example, combining
two different homoditopic monomers in the presence of a metal ion
leads to a random distribution within the polymer chain (Figure 1, top).8 Consequently, the successful preparation of supramolecular
alternate copolymers containing metals may be obtained only by strategies
that use two types of supramolecular interactions that do not communicate
with each other as described by Schubert and collaborators (i.e.,
combining metal coordination and hydrogen bonding for example).9 Construction of separate block supramolecular
polymer chains may also be achieved by using two different noncovalent
interactions.

Figure 1 Illustration of supramolecular assemblies with two ditopic
ligands
and a metal ion with (top) random distribution and (bottom) controlled
polymerization: alternate metallo-copolymer or block metallopolymer.

Here, we show that the metallopolymer
sequence can be controlled
by chirality and the choice of the metal ion.10 Whereas the formation of a block metallopolymer may be obtained
through the formation of homoleptic complexes, an alternate metallopolymer
may be obtained only when heteroleptic complexes are formed. More
precisely, we show that the heteroformation and homoformation of ML2-type complexes may be controlled by chirality-directed self-assembly
using neutral chiral C2-symmetric bisoxazoline
ligands. In particular, we show how the prevalent coordination geometries
at metal centers control the sequences of the metallopolymers. We
thus report the successful utilization of this approach for the selective
formation of metallo-copolymers as a function of the metal salt used
(Cu2+ or Zn2+).

Results and Discussion
Ligand
Synthesis
Expanding on our previous work on
the metal–bisox-based self-assembly, where we showed that neutral
chiral bisoxazolines are versatile motifs for the construction of
alternating coordination polymers with zinc ions,11 we recently designed a chiral ditopic ligand with a π-conjugated
spacer unit (named DiVinylBox, Figure 2).12 This ligand has been
successfully used for constructing advanced chiral materials with
nickel, and the resulting chiral metallo-supramolecular films have
been shown to give rise to high levels of optically active sum-frequency
generation signals. However, since the ligands act as chromophores
in this system, they also constitute good probes to study the metallo-supramolecular
assembly by means of UV–vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies.
These ligands were easily obtained from a double Knoevenagel condensation
using terephthalaldehyde and 2 equiv of bisoxazoline in the presence
of piperidinium acetate (Figure 2).13,14 The two enantiomers using i-Pr substituents were obtained in 70% yield using conventional
heating or in 60% under microwave conditions.

Figure 2 Synthesis of DiVinylBox
ligands through Knoevenagel condensation.

As mentioned previously, suitable crystals for X-ray diffraction
studies were obtained with the (S) enantiomer.12 The analysis confirmed the formation of the
monomer as shown on Figure 3. In the solid state, the molecule shows a conjugated π-system
that includes two imine moieties. The two remaining oxazoline rings
lie perpendicular to the plane of the conjugated system due to steric
interaction with two hydrogen atoms of the phenyl ring. This conformation
is also the one predicted by geometry optimization for an isolated
molecule at the density functional theory (DFT) level of accuracy
(see Supporting Information (SI) for details).
As a consequence of the long conjugation path, time-dependent (TD)
DFT predicts a fully allowed dipolar transition at 365 nm. Although
showing a distinct yellowish hue compatible with an absorption in
the violet range in the polycrystalline form, the compound exhibits
a broadband absorbance centered at 328 nm in solution in methanol,
indicating that the conjugation path is most likely weakened by large-amplitude
twisting motions of the ligand’s backbone involving the vinyl
and imine groups. In addition, methanol being a protic solvent, the
polarizable continuum model (PCM) used in the TD-DFT calculations
may perform poorly for uncoordinated imine nitrogen atoms.

Self-Assembly and Solution
Studies of the Assemblies with Copper
Ions
The formation of a metallopolymer in solution can be
achieved by the simple addition of 1 equiv of the appropriate metal
ion salt to a solution of the ditopic monomer and the process is easily
monitored by UV spectroscopy.15,16 The self-assembly reaction
with copper ions was thus studied by UV titration using the DiVinylBox
ligand and Cu(BF4)2 as the metal precursor.
Upon addition of Cu2+ to a solution of enantiopure DiVinylBox
monomers, the main π–π* absorption peak undergoes
a blue shift from 328 to 292 nm, leaving a shoulder in its place extending
out from 325 to 410 nm. The absorption spectra also reveal a very
weak and broad band centered around 500 nm (Figure 4), which we attribute to a ligand-to-metal
charge transfer (LMCT) transition of the metal complex (see SI).

Figure 4 Titration of a (S)-DiVinylBox
ligand concentration
of 2.5 × 10–5 M in MeOH with Cu(BF4)2 followed by UV–vis spectroscopy. The spectra
corresponding to 0 and 1 equiv of Cu2+ added are displayed
as black and red traces, respectively. The black arrow indicates the
trend in the spectral feature upon addition of the salt. The insets
show the change in absorbance at 328 nm as a function of added Cu2+.

Plotting the intensity of the
band at 328 nm as a function of increasing
Cu2+/ligand ratio (inset of Figure 4) reveals a decrease of the intensity until
a 1:1 ratio is reached, strongly suggesting the formation of a homochiral
metallopolymer. Titration measurements performed on a racemic mixture
of ligands gave results that were nearly identical to those obtained
with enantiopure monomers (see SI), consistent
with the most likely formation of block homochiral metallopolymers.

Additionally, the results from UV–visible titrations are
corroborated by titrations monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
as shown in Figure 5. Addition of Cu2+ to the (S)-DiVinylBox
monomer leads to the formation of the corresponding chiral metallopolymer
and results in a strong CD signal at 302 nm, which gradually increases
until the exact 1:1 metal/ligand ratio is reached. Further addition
of copper salt to the solution does not result in any change, thus
demonstrating that the metallopolymer does not depolymerize in the
presence of excess metal ions. Furthermore, the observed CD signals
are of the opposite signs when the other enantiomer is used to assemble
the (R) homochiral metallopolymer as shown in the Supporting Information (SI).

Figure 5 CD spectral changes in
the titration of (S)-DiVinylBox
solution (MeOH, c = 2.5 × 10–5 M) with Cu(BF4)2. The black arrow indicates
the change in the main spectral feature upon addition of the salt.
The inset shows the increase in CD intensities at 302 nm.

Although the CD spectra display an asymmetric band
shape whose
maxima do not coincide exactly with the position of the absorption
maximum upon chelation of the metal ions, they must be attributed
to the main ligand-centered π–π* transition when
making allowances for the torsional flexibility of the ligand. The
optical activity therefore arises from the chiral conformation of
the conjugated backbone that is being stabilized upon the formation
of the metallopolymer. A modeling by DFT geometry optimizations performed
on a single bimetallic complex consisting of a DiVinylBox ligand,
two metal ions, and four methanol molecules to complete the coordination
spheres (see SI) revealed that the two
neighboring oxazolines need to adopt a nearly coplanar conformation
to chelate the metal ions. This however leads to the phenyl ring being
twisted out of the overall plane of the ligand because of steric hindrance
involving two of its hydrogen atoms (Figure 6). Together, the two alkene moieties and
the phenyl between them adopt either a slightly twisted chair conformation
or one of the two comparably skewed boat conformations.

Figure 6 Conformational
change induced by metal coordination with the DiVinylBox
ligand. Left: rotation of the phenyl ring out of the plane leading
to the chair conformation (weak CD activity); right: alkenes positioned
in the more open of the two boat configurations, which leads to the
helical structure responsible for the positive circular dichroism
signal (R = iPr).

by UV–vis spectroscopy. Top: racemic mixture; bottom: (S) enantiomer. The spectra corresponding to 0 and 1 equiv
(top) or 2 equiv (bottom) of Zn2+ added are displayed as
black and red traces, respectively. Black arrows indicate the direction
of the trends in the spectral features upon addition of the salt.
The insets show the change in absorbance at 328 nm as a function of
added Zn2+.

In the chair geometry, the conjugation path of the π
electrons,
extending from one pair of imines to the other, nearly conforms to
having an inversion center in the middle of the phenyl ring and the
TD-DFT calculations assign it a weak rotary strength only. The two
boat configurations, by contrast, give the conjugation path helical
geometries, which give rise to large optical rotary strengths, of
opposite signs, in TD-DFT results. Both configurations have C2 symmetry and the DFT optimizations show that
they have almost identical total energies and would thus be equally
likely barring solvation and entropic effects (see SI).

Although we may expect the actual metallopolymer
to behave as a
dynamic chain whose links constantly shift between conformations,
the fact that we detect a strong positive CD in solution indicates
that the more open of the two boat conformations dominates in the
large-scale polymer structure. Thermal motions of the solvent and
the ligand in the dominant conformation lead to a heterogeneity, which
explains the differences between the position and shape of the absorption
band vs those of the CD spectral band as oscillator strengths and
rotary strengths depend inversely on the amount of twisting of the
conjugated backbone.

Self-Assembly and Solution Studies of the
Assemblies with Zinc
Ions
Titrations carried out under identical conditions, but
employing Zn(BF4)2 as the ion source, yielded
different results (Figure 7). Upon addition of Zn2+ aliquots to a solution
of the enantiopure (S)-DiVinylBox monomer, the absorption
band at 328 nm was again shifted to 292 nm leaving a shoulder sloping
off from the position of the maximum of the original band to where
it vanished, i.e., just below 380 nm. No detectable absorption has
been observed at longer wavelengths, which is consistent with the
fact that no electronic transitions involving metal d-orbitals are
possible at energies below that of the first intraligand singlet excitation.
The shoulder should therefore be attributed to free or partly free
ligand molecules, having temporarily only one of its oxazolines coordinated
to a zinc ion at one end for example.

The
same titration using the enantiopure (S)-DiVinylBox
monomer gave basically the same absorption profile. However, a different
behavior was observed while plotting the intensity of the band at
328 nm over an increasing Zn2+/ligand ratio. With the racemic
monomer, the plot clearly shows a decrease of the intensity until
a 1:1 ratio is reached, indicating the formation of the metallopolymer.
Further addition of zinc cation did not result in any absorbance variation,
thus demonstrating that the metallopolymer was stable and did not
undergo depolymerization in the presence of excess of metal salt.
In addition, an isobestic point was observed only between 0 and 0.5
equiv of zinc, suggesting that the heteroleptic species was first
formed owing to the higher binding constant for the formation of ML2-type species.

In contrast, the plot with the enantiopure
monomer shows a decrease
of the intensity until a 2:1 Zn2+/ligand is reached. In
addition, circular dichroism titration gave a weak positive signal
at 304 nm with a maximum reached at a 2:1 Zn2+/ligand ratio
(see SI). These data are consistent with
the formation of a dinuclear complex rather than a metallopolymer.

Altogether, these results show that under these conditions the
formation of the metallopolymer occurs only in the presence of the
two enantiomers of the monomer in support of their heterochiral complementarity
in the presence of zinc.

Racemic metallopolymers were also synthesized
in bulk and were
analyzed by classical methods. IR spectra indicate that the oxazoline
moieties are coordinated to the metal center (coordination shift of
the ν(CN) band of 20 cm–1). In
the 1H NMR spectra of the metallopolymer, the broader peaks
are consistent with the polymer formation. The dynamic nature of the
metallopolymers precludes gel filtration chromatography/size-exclusion
chromatography studies as only free monomers are detected as already
observed for this family of compounds.17

All UV–visible spectra showed that metal–ligand
complexation
induced a hypsochromic shift of the main absorption band of the ligand
from 328 to 292 nm regardless of the metal. This shift is concurrent
with the coordination of the bis(oxazoline) to the metal and indicates
that the coordination induces a conformational change of the monomer.
Indeed, as we have already stated with copper, the coordination of
the ligand requires having both oxazoline moities in the equatorial
plane of the metal and thus induces a conformational change of the
vinyl–phenyl–vinyl moiety. DFT geometry optimizations
of a dinuclear Zn(II) complex leads to ligand conformations (see SI) that are very similar to the ones obtained
with Cu(II) ions, although the energies of formation now differ to
a greater extent and even favor the more compact boat conformation.
However, almost identical observations can be made with regard to
the TD-DFT excitation energies (except for the obvious absence of
LMCT transitions) and dipole and rotary strengths of an individual
dinuclear complex. The fact that the CD spectra are only very weak
and noisy for enantiopure ligands in the presence of zinc ions must
be due to the lack of prevalence of a single optically active conformation
of the chromophores, which we attribute to their lesser propensity
to form extended strands, an aspect that will be addressed experimentally
using monotopic ligands below.

Complexation Studies of
the Chiral Monotopic Bisoxazoline Ligand
as a Model
The homo- and heterochiral complementarities of
a chiral C2-symmetric ligand in an ML2-type complex may be demonstrated by evaluating their binding
association constants.18 For this purpose,
we synthesized the two enantiomers of the monotopic bisoxazoline ligand
2,2′-(2-phenylethene-1,1-diyl)bis(4-isopropyl-oxazoline) VinylBox
(Scheme 1) and then
conducted titration experiments by UV–visible spectroscopy.19 Addition of the monotopic ligand (in its enantiopure
or racemic form) to a solution of Zn(BF4)2 or
Cu(BF4)2 caused changes in the spectrum, which
were analyzed as a function of the amount of ligand added. The data
were fitted to an ML or ML2 binding model to obtain the
log β values.20 With copper salt,
the fitting of the experimental data to an ML2 model showed
the overall stability log β to be 8.9 ± 0.6 in both
cases (enantiopure or racemic form of the ligand). The same feature
was observed using zinc salt and the racemic form of the ligand (log β
= 8.7 ± 0.7). However, the titration data for the addition of
the enantiopure ligand to Zn(BF4)2 were fitted
to a simple ML binding model with log β = 3.3 ±
0.4, thus suggesting that the homochiral zinc complex could not be
formed under these conditions.

Hetero- and Homocomplementarity of Bis(oxazoline)
Ligands
Thus, on the basis of chiral molecular recognition
processes, the
ditopic ligands present an adaptive characteristic as a function of
the metal salt in the medium. Harnessing the local environments around
the metal ion is key to control the chain sequence in the metallopolymer.
Thus, the successful construction of an alternate metallo-copolymer
is only possible by dynamic heteroleptic coordination at a metal center,
which should contain freely exchangeable ligands under thermodynamic
control. Reliable heteroaggregation at the mononuclear level can be
set up using either topological or steric constraints and the principle
of maximal site occupancy.21 Oxazoline-based
ligands such as bisoxazolines ligands have attracted much attention
because they have been successfully used in a wide range of enantioselective
catalytic reactions. With a C2-symmetric
bisoxazoline ligand, the orientation as well as the steric demand
of the substituents at the chiral center in the 4 position of the
heterocyclic ring are the critical factors that determine the formation
of the homoleptic species ML2. The combination of two chiral
enantiopure C2-symmetric bisox ligands
in a tetrahedral geometry offers two possible complexes: heterochiral
(RR + SS) or homochiral (SS + SS or RR + RR) (Figure 8).22 As already observed, the heterochiral
complex, which is the least sterically hindered, is the more stable
since the orientation of the substituents is complementary. A square
planar geometry with two bisox ligands also gives two possible stereoisomers
(heterochiral or homochiral); however, the least sterically hindered
should be the homochiral complex. Such features should also be observed
in an octahedral environment in which the two ligands arrange each
other in the equatorial position.23

combinations.

Summary
In conclusion,
using UV–visible titration, we have shown
that we can take advantage of a self-sorting process through the pertinent
choice of chiral ditopic ligands and metal ions. With copper(II) ions,
block homochiral metallopolymers have been formed, whereas with zinc(II)
ions alternate metallo-copolymers have been produced.

In the
course of our study, we have been able to show that the
specific way in which chiral DiVinylBox ligands may act as helicene-like
chromophores made it possible to gain additional information about
their metallopolymer-forming abilities when carrying titration experiments
over from the UV–vis absorption spectroscopy to the CD domain.
In particular, examining the data in the light of DFT calculations
performed on simple complexes has revealed the importance of the changes
in the geometry that the ligand may undergo. Not only does the deconjugation
of the central phenyl ring upon chelation of a metal ion by a bisoxazoline
unit favor the reversible nature of the coordination by acting as
a spring-loaded mechanism, but the available positions for the iso-propyl groups on the bisoxazolines with respect to the
phenyl ring and to each other allow the polymer some flexibility between
linear or coiled segments. Strikingly, the observation of optical
activity reveals that solvent and entropic effects, and not direct
steric hindrance, lead to a preferred helical conformation of the
ligand and thus to a specific coiled form of the polymer. If it turns
out to be possible to induce a preference for one or the other through
changes in the environment, then this should be detectable using optical
titration experiments as well.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All organic syntheses were performed
under an inert atmosphere of dry nitrogen by using standard vacuum
line and Schlenk tube techniques. Solvents were purified and degassed
by standard procedures. All reagents were used without further purification.
MeOH purchased was of spectrometric grade and used without any purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded by using a
Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer using the residual solvent peak as
a reference (CDCl3: δH = 7.26 ppm; δC = 77.16
ppm) at 298 K. Positive-mode electrospray ionization mass spectra
(ESI-MS) were recorded on microTOF, Bruker Daltonics. UV–visible
absorption spectra were recorded on a HITACHI U-3000 spectrophotometer.
The stability constants of metal complexes were calculated by the
Bindfit program.20 Circular dichroism absorption
experiments were carried out with a UV–visible Jasco J-810
CD spectrometer using a 1 cm optical path quartz cell at 20.0 ±
0.1 °C. The monotopic VinylBox ligand was synthesized according
to reported procedures.24 All structures
have been optimized and their excited states calculated at the B3-LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level of theory while applying the polarizable continuum model (PCM)
for methanol with the Gaussian 09 Rev. D01 software. Computational
details of DFT calculations can be found in the Supporting Information.

X-ray diffraction studies were
carried out by Dr. Lydia Brelot and Corinne Bailly at the Chemistry
Institute X-ray Facility of the University of Strasbourg: crystal
data were collected at 173 K using a Mo Kα graphite monochromated
(λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation on a Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer.
The structure was solved using direct methods with SHELXS97552 and
refined against F2 using the SHELXL97
software.553. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen
atoms were generated according to stereochemistry and refined using
a riding model in SHELXL97.

stirred for 2 min before being subjected to microwave irradiation
for 4 h at 70 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the pyridine
was removed under vacuum, yielding a yellow oil, which was purified
by silica-gel column chromatography (AcOEt/MeOH, 95:5) to yield a
