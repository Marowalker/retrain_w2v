Red
light-sensitized squaraine (SQ) dyes were developed
and incorporated into dye-sensitized catalysts (DSCs) with the formula
of SQ/TiO2/Cat, and their efficacies were
evaluated in terms of performance on either water or carbon dioxide
reduction. Pt nanoparticles or fac-[Re(4,4′-bis-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl] were used as each catalytic center within the DSC frame
of SQ/TiO2/Pt (Type I) or SQ/TiO2/Re(I) (Type II). In order to convey the potential utility
of SQ in low energy sensitization, the following catalytic
reductions were carried out under selective lower energy irradiation
(>500 nm). Type I and II showed different catalytic performances,
primarily due to the choice of solvent for each catalytic condition:
hydrogenation was carried out in H2O, but CO2 reduction in dimethylformamide (DMF), and SQ was more
stable in aqueous acid conditions for hydrogen generation than CO2 reduction in DMF. A suspension of Type I in 3 mL water containing
0.1 M ascorbic acid (pH = 2.66) resulted in efficient photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution, producing 37 μmol of H2 for 4
h. However, in photocatalysis of Type II (SQ/TiO2/Re(I)) in 3 mL DMF containing 0.1 M 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazole,
the TiO2-bound SQ dyes were not capable of
working as a low energy sensitizer because SQ was susceptible
to dye decomposition in nucleophilic DMF conditions, resulting in
DSC deactivation for the CO2 reduction. Even with the limitation
of solvent, the DSC conditions for the utility of SQ have
been established: the anchoring group effect of SQ with
either phosphonic acid or carboxylic acid onto the TiO2 surface; energy alignment of SQ with the flat band
potentials (Efb) of TiO2 semiconductors
and the reduction power of electron donors; and the wavelength range
of the light source used, particularly when >500 nm.

Introduction
Converting solar energy
into chemical energy represents a promising
strategy for replacing fossil fuels with renewable and sustainable
energy.1−5 The buildup of a photocatalytic conversion system for such solar
fuel production requires the optimum organization of a visible light-harvesting
photosensitizer and reduction catalyst that can achieve an efficient
light-driven flow of electrons from an electron donor to the catalyst
for solar-to-chemical conversion, typically hydrogen evolution2,6−10 or CO2 reduction.11−17 Among several strategies, multicomponent dye-sensitized photocatalysis
(DSP) for light-driven hydrogen production18−22 and CO2 reduction23−31 offer several advantages over conventional homogeneous strategies:
facile preparation and tunability of the catalytic system with a rational
design for optimizing activity, efficient photoelectron collection
and charge separation of photosensitizers by semiconductor immobilization,
and on-demand multi-electron transportation toward the reduction catalyst
through the accumulation of long-lived electrons in the conduction
band (CB) of the semiconductor.32,33

Despite such
advantages, DSP systems can still experience performance
improvement with a photosensitizer and its rational interfacial engineering
with an inorganic semiconductor and component substitution at the
semiconductor surface with the catalyst. Regarding research into the
photosensitizer, one of the primary issues has been the visible-light
absorbing dye that can efficiently harvest far-red and even near-IR
solar radiance to maximize overall photocatalytic activities.34−38 The use of a long-wavelength absorber typically known for use in
porphyrin derivatives with reduction catalysts has been studied for
light-driven catalysis,15,39−41 and recent efforts in improved dye-sensitized catalyst materials
have continued to emerge,42,43 but only a limited
number of red-light photosensitizers have been reported. In this regard,
the squaraine derivative can be considered a potential alternative
red and near-IR sensitizer44−46 because of its high extinction
coefficients in the region of 600–800 nm and its easy synthetic
tunability. However, until recently, squaraine dyes have been relatively
rarely used in photocatalysis, although the applications of squaraine
dyes are as extensive as other visible light active antenna in the
field of dye-sensitized solar cells36−38,47−51 and organic solar cells.52−54 This limited utilization is thought
to be derived from weaknesses such as the low structural stability
of the central cyclobutene ring to nucleophilic attack, lack of directionality
in the excited state with a fluorescent lifetime (∼1 ns), and
formation of nonfluorescent aggregates, which limit the use of squaraine
dyes in photocatalysis.

The above DSP platform can be considered
to be one of the most
prominent strategies with positive effects of squaraine immobilization
on semiconductors. The rapid consumption of photogenerated anionic
and/or oxidized species on the TiO2 surface is expected
to effectively alleviate the photodecomposition of anchored squaraine
dyes during photolysis, consequently improving its durability with
an enhanced charge separation/collection yield.27 On the other hand, the introduction of squaraine dyes,
long-wavelength sensitizers, in the DSP system could also be a viable
way to avoid such considerable loss of light harvesting arising from
extensive light scattering by dispersions of the hybrid particles
in solution, because the penetration of the red and near-IR light
is generally superior to that of the blue and green light with a relatively
high frequency wave.

Scheme 1 describes
the essential components of the present photocatalytic hybrid systems
using squaraine dyes (SQ; X = COOH or PO3H2) and catalysts (Cat = Pt nanoparticles for hydrogen generation
and Re(I) for CO2 to CO conversion). Herein, we present
the details of two representative hybrid models, Type I (SQ/TiO2/Pt) for hydrogen generation and Type II (SQ/TiO2/Re(I)) for CO2 reduction, which were
prepared through the covalent anchoring of SQ on two
functional TiO2/Pt and TiO2/Re(I) catalytic
particles. The photocatalytic properties of the resulting SQ-sensitized TiO2 hybrid were found to differ substantially
from the anchoring ability of SQ, reaction solvent media,
and the energy levels of the components relative to the TiO2 CB edge according to the systems and reaction conditions. These
investigations offer a useful guideline for optimizing the activity
and durability of squaraine-based photocatalytic systems.

Materials: Preparation of Squaraine Derivatives
and Integration
of SQ/TiO2/Cat (Cat = Pt or Re(I))
For successful low energy sensitization, the electron-withdrawing
1-cyanovinyl-phosphonic or -carboxylic acid anchoring group is attached
to the core indolenine part in order to achieve a directional electron
flow from squaraine to the CB of TiO2 and also to improve
the light harvesting ability by extending the optical absorption wavelength
toward the red region. Two different anchoring groups (1-cyanoacrylic
acid and (1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid) were used in order to investigate
any possible anchoring effects on the catalytic activities of the
systems. The linear dodecyl group was introduced to the squaraine
moiety to avoid π–π aggregation between the squaraine
dyes on the TiO2 surface.48

The two donor–acceptor type squaraine derivatives (SQCA and SQPA) were prepared through the modification of a previously described
synthetic method (Scheme 2). The asymmetric bromo-bis(indoline) squaraine (SQBr) was prepared under the reported reaction
conditions.48 A Pd-catalyzed C–C
coupling reaction of SQBr with
5-formylthiophen-2-yl boronic acid gave the aldehyde precursor (SQCHO) with high yield (∼70%),
which was further treated with cyanoacetic acid to yield SQCA and with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate
to yield SQPE. Subsequent hydrolysis
of the phosphonic ester with bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr) produced
the desired SQPA in moderate
yield (∼40%). All products were identified through 1H NMR spectroscopy and ESI-mass spectrometry. The detailed procedures
and characterization of all squaraine derivatives are provided in
the Experimental Section.

Squaraine Derivatives (SQCA, SQPE, and SQPA)
Conditions: (i) 5-formylthiophene-2-yl
boronic acid, Pd(dppf)Cl2, K2CO3,
and toluene/MeOH; (ii) piperidine, cyanoacetic acid, and CHCl3; (iii) piperidine, diethylcyanomethyl phosphonate, and CHCl3; (iv) TMSBr, CHCl3, and MeOH.

The Re(I) catalyst, fac-[Re(4,4′-bis-(dihydroxyphosphorylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl], was prepared according to a previously published method.26 The platinized TiO2 particles (TiO2/Pt) were prepared according to the previously published procedures
using Degussa P25.22 The successful anchoring
of SQ and Re(I) on TiO2 nanoparticles was
confirmed through diffuse-reflectance spectra (DRS) showing the absorption
maximum of squaraine dyes at ∼680 nm (inset in Figure 1) and via
the IR absorption peaks indicating three characteristic CO peaks of
Re(I) (2027, 1914, and 1906 cm–1) (see Figure S1
of the Supporting Information). The supernatant
separated after centrifugation of the SQ- and/or Re(I)-treated
suspensions show negligible absorption of SQ and Re(I),
confirming the quantitative fixation of the components. In this study,
ascorbic acid (AscH)55 and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazole
(BIH)56 were used as the electron donors
for hydrogen evolution in water and for CO2 reduction in
dimethylformamide (DMF), respectively.

DMF or H2O under various conditions.

Photophysical Properties
Figure 1 and Table 1 both show the UV/vis/NIR absorption spectra of SQCA and SQPA in DMF, which exhibit a typical narrow absorption
band centered at ∼670 nm with a high molar absorption coefficient
of (1.1–1.8) × 105 M–1 cm–1. As has been reported by Shi et al.,48 the absorption bands of SQCA and SQPA are red shifted
as compared to the previously reported pristine squaraine dye (SQ1), because of the effective intramolecular charge transfer
(ICT) and π-elongation effects of the electron-withdrawing cyanovinyl
moiety. The absorption spectra of SQ immobilized on the
TiO2 powder (SQ/TiO2) are slightly
red-shifted and broadened. This behavior can be understood in terms
of the formation of J-aggregates of the adsorbed SQ on
the TiO2 surface and/or the interaction between the sensitizer
and TiO2, with optical effects such as scattering and reflection
of TiO2.57 The zero–zero
transition energies (E0–0) were
calculated based on the crossing point of the normalized absorption
and emission spectra (Figure 1), which are listed in Table 1. Overall, the two asymmetrical squaraine derivatives
exhibit broader and additional absorption in the longer wavelength
region, which should be favorable for light harvesting. Upon the excitation
of SQ at 664 nm, red emissions centered at 680 nm (±2
nm) appear to show a mirror image against the absorption spectra with
small Stokes shifts (Δv = 329–375 cm–1), indicating the delocalization and small reorganization
energy of the excited state (Table 1).44−46

Electrochemical Properties
The primary
event of dye
photosensitization is the electron injection from SQ into
TiO2, for which the electrochemical redox potentials of SQ were determined using cyclic voltammetry. Table 2 presents the half-wave oxidation
and reduction potentials of SQCA and SQPE (Eox/red), which are 0.36/–1.30 and 0.33/–1.18
V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE), respectively. It should
be noted that the redox potentials of SQPE, the ethyl ester of SQPA, are used in place of those of SQPA, because the latter revealed no reliable electrochemical behavior,
presumably due to the chemisorption of SQPA on the Pt working electrode. The two squaraine dyes show relatively
lower reduction potentials than the pristine squaraine dye (SQ1),36,48 which is attributed to the enhanced
ICT and extended π-conjugation caused by incorporating the electron-accepting
ability of the cyanoacrylic- or (1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid moiety.
A similar trend can also be observed in the density functional theory
(DFT) calculations for the squaraine dyes: SQCA and SQPA (−(2.61
to 2.81) eV) have relatively lower LUMOs than pristine SQ1 (−2.49 eV) (see Figure 3). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy
levels of the push–pull SQ are mainly inherited
from the indolenine unit, whereas their lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) energy levels are mostly populated on the electron-withdrawing
anchoring moieties, reflecting their better directionality in the
excited state relative to SQ1. Figure 2 summarizes the oxidation and reduction potentials
of components {SQ, SED (sacrificial electron donor),
and catalytic unit [Pt and Re(I)]} in their ground/excited states
with the CB of TiO2 varying according to the solvent environment.
The regeneration of SQ by the reduction of SQ•+ with SED (AscH or BIH) is an essential process
that should determine the TON and long-term stability of SQ. The free-energy changes of this process (ΔGreg) can be given by the difference between the oxidation
potentials (Eox) of SQ and
SED (0.46 V for AscH and 0.28 V for BIH vs SCE, which are sufficiently
negative (ΔGreg = −(0.08
to −0.21) eV for AscH and −(0.26 to 0.39) eV for BIH)
for electron transfer from SED to SQ•+ to regenerate SQ. The excited state oxidation potential
(Eox*) of SQ is relevant to electron injection from
excited-state SQ into TiO2, and is estimated
to be from the excitation energy (E0–0) and Eox of SQ (E(SQCA)ox* = −1.48
V) and E(SQPE)ox* = −1.51
V). The Eox* values were compared with the apparent flat-band
potential (Vfb) of the TiO2 nanoparticle film determined via Mott–Schottky analysis,
which is −(0.5 to 1.1) V versus SCE in water with variation
of pH (0–12)58−62 or −(1.5 to 2.6) V versus SCE in DMF depending on water contents
(0–20 vol %).26,28,29 In aqueous media, the Eox* values are much substantially negative
than Vfb of TiO2 (typically
∼−0.5 V at pH = ∼2), so the electron injection
from 1SQ* into TiO2 must be sufficiently
exergonic to efficiently proceed. In DMF, on the other hand, Eox* of SQ is slightly more positive by 0.26 or 0.23 eV
than Vfb of TiO2 [∼−1.74
V vs SCE in the presence of 3% (v/v) H2O].26 According to the estimation, the electron injection in
DMF should be slow. However, in reality, the fluorescence of SQ anchored on a TiO2 mesoporous film was quenched
within a time domain of 25 ps, which was much shorter than the fluorescence
lifetimes in DMF (140 ps for SQCA and 1.72 ns for SQPE) (Figure
S2 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information).

Photocatalytic Hydrogen
Evolution of the SQ/TiO2/Pt Catalyst (Type
I)
The hydrogen-evolution experiment
was undertaken under red-light (>500 nm) irradiation of 10 mg Type
I hybrid particles dispersed in 3 mL water in the presence of AscH,
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), or triethanolamine (TEOA)
as the sacrificial electron donor. In all the cases of photolysis,
a concentration of 3.3 g TiO2/L (10 mg TiO2 nanoparticles
in 3 mL reaction solvent) was used as the optimum condition of light
absorption of the irradiated heterogeneous system.63Table 3 summarizes
the hydrogen product observed under various conditions, including
the net formation amounts in μmol, turnover number (TONNP) in mol H2 (g TiO2)−1, and turnover frequency (TOFNP) in μmol H2 h–1 (g TiO2)−1. First,
the effects of SQ-anchoring amounts on TiO2/Pt nanoparticles were investigated in order to identify the optimal
conditions. In Type I hybrid, the photocatalytic H2 evolution
increased with increasing loading amounts of SQ from
0.2 to 4.8 μmol to reach a maximum at 1.6 μmol, while
no further increase of H2 was observed at higher SQ loading amounts (see entries 1–10 of Table 3 and Figure 4b). The change in the anchoring group from
−COOH to −PO3H2 significantly
enhanced the photocatalytic activity (see TONNP and TOFNP in Table 3 and Figure 4).

a The following standard conditions
were employed: 10 mg of TiO2/Pt was commonly used as the
sacrificial electron donor and immobilizer of the functional components
(SQCA and SQPA); the hybrids were modified with various amounts
of SQ (0.2–4.8 μmol). The total volume of
the solution or suspension was 3 mL. All of the photocatalytic reactions
were performed in distilled water containing 0.1 M AscH at greater
than 500 nm emitted from an LED lamp (60 W, Cree Inc.).

In order to verify the effects of the different TiO2 particles, Degussa P-25 (d-TiO2, ca. 25% rutile and 75%
anatase) and homemade TiO2 nanosheets (s-TiO2, [001] facet-exposed TiO2)64 were applied to this hybrid system. The results indicated that the
d- and s-TiO2-based hybrids showed significantly poorer
photocatalytic activities than Type I hybrid based on h-TiO2 (see entries 15–18 in Table 3).

The results of the control experiments indicate
that the co-loading
of both SQ and Pt on TiO2 is essential for
the efficient production of hydrogen, since SQ/TiO2 or TiO2/Pt without the immobilization of either SQ or Pt reveals almost no hydrogen evolution activities (see
entries 11 and 12 in Table 3). In the dark or in the absence of AscH, H2 evolution
was either not detected at all or only occurred in a trace amount.
In addition, very poor H2 production was observed when
EDTA and TEOA were used as SED in place of AscH (Figures 4a and 5). These results can be understood in terms of the different reducing
powers of the SEDs used [E(SED)ox = 0.57–0.82
V for TEOA, 0.57–0.92 V for EDTA, and 0.46 V for AscH vs SCE]. 1

under
2 h irradiation at >500 nm; 10 mg of SQ (1.6 μmol)/TiO2/Pt and 0.1 M AscH in 3 mL N2-saturated water.

The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of photocatalyzed
H2 formation at 436 nm for the Type I hybrid catalyst (SQPA/h-TiO2/Pt) in water
containing
0.1 M AscH was determined to be (1.15 ± 0.07)%. However, note
that the AQY determined is not the real quantum yield with scientific
definition but reveals a relative measure for the estimation of hydrogen
production efficiency, because the number of photons absorbed by the
TiO2-bound SQ dye cannot be exactly estimated
in the present heterogeneous system without optical effects (light
scattering) of mesoporous TiO2 particles (of the TiO2 particle dispersion system). The poor AQY can partly be interpreted
in terms of optical effects (extensive light scattering) of mesoporous
TiO2 particles.

Photocatalytic Behavior of SQ/TiO2/Re(I)
(Type II)
Previously, we have reported that the reduction
of CO2 to CO can be effectively photosensitized by a blue-green
active dye anchored on TiO2/Re(I) particles in DMF; Re(I)
is CO2 to CO conversion which is fixed on TiO2 through PO3H2 anchoring. The successful red-light
photosensitization of H2 evolution by SQ as
described above led us to investigate the applicability of SQ photosensitization to CO2 to CO conversion based on TiO2/Re(I) particles in DMF. First, SQ/TiO2/Re(I) catalysts (Type II) were prepared by anchoring SQ on TiO2/Re(I) particles. Next, dispersions of 10 mg of
Type II hybrid in 3 mL of CO2-saturated DMF in the presence
of BIH as SED were irradiated with a white-light light-emitting diode
(LED) through an optical filter cutting off the light shorter than
400 nm or than 500 nm. Figure 6a shows temporal plots of CO formation under >400 nm irradiation.
The CO2 to CO reduction activity [TONCO = moles
of CO formed per mol of Re(I)] of Type II using SQPA was found to be kept for an extended period
of time up to 70 h, reaching ∼165 with only slight leveling-off
tendency, while the sensitization with SQCA showed higher efficiencies by 23 h but also a levelling-off
tendency under longer-time irradiation. Note that an induction period
was commonly observed around ∼2 h in both cases. Figure 6b exhibits plots of CO formation
in the initial irradiation time of ≤10 h for Type II with SQCA under irradiation at >400
nm.
The induction period was observed within 2 h under >400 nm irradiation
and by a much longer period of time (∼7 h) under >500 nm
irradiation
(see Figure 7). The
gaseous products formed in the headspace of the reactor were then
analyzed by GC. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of
the liquid-phase contents was performed to detect such liquid products
as formic acid and oxalic acid. The results confirm that CO is the
exclusive product with a trace amount of H2, while neither
formate nor oxalic acid was detected in any amount. An isotope-tracing
experiment for SQCA/TiO2/Re(I) dispersions (in 13CO2-saturated DMF-d7) was performed by GC-mass. The 13C isotope abundance analysis of CO (>95%) indicates that CO2 is the source of CO produced (see Figure S3 of the Supporting Information).

>400 nm.

However, in contrast to Type I in aqueous media,
the initial intense
blue SQ/TiO2/Re(I) hybrid particles (Type
II) have become pale yellow after photolysis (see the inset of Figure 8). As shown in Figure 8, the intensity of
the long-wavelength absorption band at ∼680 nm is rapidly diminished
with increasing photolysis time (0–10 h). Further, the observation
of almost no catalytic activity of Type II hybrid under low energy
irradiation (λ >500 nm) reflects such full loss of long-wavelength
absorption. In turn, this result confirms that the SQ dyes are not capable of functioning as a low energy sensitizer during
photolysis of Type II hybrid for CO2 reduction (see Figure 7 and entry 5 of Table 4). Note that the initial
absorption intensities of SQ around 400 nm are maintained
under continuous LED irradiation irrespective of the full loss of
low energy absorption (mainly around 500 and 680 nm) (Figure 8). This implies that undefined
organic species (formed with photobleaching of SQ) can
continuously play a role as visible-light harvesters due to the survived
absorption capability at the ∼400 nm region. This result also
has important implications for the steady CO production observed in
the above SQ-based photocatalysis under >400 nm (Figure 6). However, at this
point, the exact structure of photomodified species is unclear, as
its characterization is still underway.

a The following standard
conditions
were employed: 0.1 M BIH and 10 mg of TiO2 are commonly
used as the sacrificial electron donor and immobilizer of 0.1 μmol
Re(I) catalyst and 0.8 μmol SQ, respectively. The
total volume of the suspension was 3 mL. All photocatalytic reactions
are performed in CO2-saturated DMF irradiated at >400
or
500 nm using an LED lamp (60 W, Cree Inc.).

Discussion
According to the experimental
data and interpretation presented
above, the overall photocatalytic cycle of Type I hybrid would follow
the proposed reaction sequences (Scheme 3). Upon low energy sensitization, ultrafast
electron injection from 1SQ* to the TiO2 CB via oxidative quenching commonly occurs with very fast
trapping of the injected electrons to give trapped electrons [TiO2(e–)] (process 1). The injected electrons
in the bulk phase are generally long-lived, with most of them staying
in the CB of TiO2.32,33 Subsequently, TiO2 shuttles the electrons to the anchored reduction catalytic
sites (Pt) simultaneously (process 2). At the Pt sites in aqueous
media, the reduction of proton (H+) occurs, resulting in
net hydrogen production (process 4). The overall photocatalytic sequence
of hydrogen evolution is completed with the successive regeneration
of SQ by the reduction of SQ•+ with AscH (process 3).

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism for Hydrogen Production
in Heterogeneous Photocatalysis
by SQ/TiO2/Pt (Type I)
In the above water-splitting hydrogen production of Type
I hybrid,
the observed anchoring group dependency (Table 3) can be interpreted in terms of the higher
binding affinity of phosphonic acid (compared to the carboxylic acid)
which leads to a suppressed photobleaching phenomenon during photolysis,
as observed in our previous work.27 This
hypothesis is supported by DRS comparison of Type I hybrid measured
prior to and after photolysis: the DRS absorption spectra of SQPA fixed on TiO2 maintains
the original absorption feature at the ∼680 nm region after
photolysis for 5 h, whereas a discernible reduction was observed for SQCA, indicating some probability
of photobleaching behavior of SQ detached under continuous
irradiation (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). Such anchoring group dependency is consistent with that observed
in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction of Type II hybrid.
The contrasting photoactivities with variation of TiO2 semiconductor
are consistent with our previous explanation that each TiO2 source has different distributions of surface states/trap sites
and grain boundaries associated with electron injection efficiencies
from SQ* to the TiO2 CB, charge recombination
between SQ•+ and trapped TiO2 CB electrons [TiO2(e–)], and the catalytic
properties.27 Regarding the electron donor
dependency of catalytic activity observed above, apart from different
reducing power of electron donors used, the significant change of
its pH value with variation of SED should also be considered as another
key factor affecting the overall activity because an acidic condition
(H+) in aqueous media can help accelerate the H2 production in photocatalytic reaction. Measurements of the pH values
for three SEDs were made as following; each 0.1 M AscH, EDTA, and
TEOA in aqueous media resulted in a pH value of 2.66, 2.91, and 10.86,
respectively. However, the observed SED dependency should be understood
as a result of the different reducing powers of the SEDs rather than
their pH difference because two similar acidic conditions using each
AscH (pH = 2.66) and EDTA (pH = 2.91) as SED have dissimilar photocatalytic
activities.

In an effort to elucidate the cause of low energy
sensitization
failure of SQ in Type II hybrid, time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements for SQCA or SQPA/TiO2 (dyes anchored
on TiO2, injecting case) were carried out to confirm whether
the photoexcited electrons are injected to TiO2 particles,
where SQCA and SQPA were fixed on TiO2-coated sapphire
glass windows. In this study, homogeneous SQ in DMF was
used as reference for the noninjection case to TiO2. Figure S2 shows the TRF profiles of the samples
taken by 640 nm excitation. Interestingly, for the TiO2-free solutions, no fast decay component shorter than 100 ps was
observed in their TRFs, whereas for the films, the lifetimes were
dramatically decreased to about 20 and 26 ps for SQCA/TiO2 and SQPA/TiO2 films, respectively (see Table S1
of the Supporting Information), indicating
that the fast electron injection process indeed occurs at the interface
between SQ and TiO2 nanoparticles. This result
is the exact opposite of what is observed on experiment: the uphill
process (positive free Gibbs energy) (ΔG =
−(0.02 to 0.22) V, from SQ* to TiO2) and the almost no photocatalytic activity under >500 nm irradiation.
However, an electron injection can occur with not only the strong
electronic coupling between the SQ LUMO orbital and TiO2 CB, but also the existence of various shallow surface trapping
sites/bands that are 0.3–1.0 eV below the TiO2 CB,
as has been reported in several dye/TiO2 systems.65−69 At this point, it is not clear what factor drives the low photocatalytic
activity in the DMF-mediated photolysis for CO2 reduction.
We now think that there might exist other possible quenching pathways
of photoexcited electrons via an undefined side reaction including
photodecomposition of TiO2-bound SQ.

In addition, a probable formation of SQ/BIH+ (oxidized SED) ion-pair complexes in aprotic solvent media can be
considered to be another reason of fast photobleaching, given that
the SQ/cationic salt combination tends to undergo a photobleaching
of SQ with the generation of active radical species.70 This result differs from our previous ternary
systems based on other photosensitizers (i.e., typical push–pull
organic dye26,28−30 and porphyrin27). In addition to the solvent dependency on photostability
of SQ discussed above, we now think such low photostability
of SQ may be partially derived from the intrinsic fragility
of the squaraine structure. By contrast, the relatively less photobleaching
of SQ in water media can be considered the result of
the protection of the electron deficient cyclobutene ring of SQ by hydrogen bond formation between H2O molecules
and the oxygen atoms of the cyclobutene ring. During photoreaction
of Type I hybrid, the cyclobutene ring of SQ can be readily
attacked by nucleophilic species such as ascorbate (deprotonated AscH)
or undefined nucleophiles.71

Regarding
the reduction process via anchored molecular Re(I) complexes
in Type II hybrid, regardless of the kind of structure the real photosensitizing
unit has during photolysis, the observed photocatalytic CO2 to CO conversion should follow the monomeric mechanism (suggested
by our previous Re(I)-immobilized TiO2 system26) rather than the formation of the CO2-bridged dimer complex (LReCOOReL)72−74 because the Re(I) complex
was almost individually immobilized on the TiO2 surface
(Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Possible
Chemical Processes for Two-Electron Reduction of CO2 to
CO Catalyzed by the TiO2-Bound Re(I) Complex
in Photocatalysis of Type II Hybrid
Overall, based on the above photolysis results and the results
of the photobleaching experiment of SQ, the photocatalytic
efficiency of the SQ-based photocatalytic system seems
to be associated more with the degree of photostability of SQ in different reaction solvents than the energy level-related thermodynamic
electron injection issue.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
synthesized two asymmetric squaraine dyes marked
by linear dodecyl spacers and anchoring groups with π-conjugated
electron-withdrawing cyano (−CN) moieties. The prepared push–pull
squaraine dyes (SQCA and SQPA) have been successfully engaged
via chemical anchoring to the TiO2/catalyst hybrid platform
for photocatalytic hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction.
Under lower energy irradiation (>500 nm), the SQPA/TiO2/Pt catalyst (Type I) in AscH
buffered (0.10 M) water showed an efficient photocatalytic hydrogen
production with secured optimal electron flow from SQ to the Pt site coupled with the alleviated photobleaching of SQ, providing ∼42 μmol H2 for 2 h.
However, in DMF-mediated photocatalysis of SQs/TiO2/Re(I) (Type II) for CO2 reduction, the low energy
sensitization by SQ was not successful for the following
reasons; (1) the significant photodegradation of SQ and
(2) its energy-level mismatch (uphill process from SQ to TiO2). On the other hand, under high energy irradiation
(>400 nm) conditions, the photodegraded SQ was found
to function as a real photosensitizer after the induction period,
giving a TONCO of ∼165 for 70 h. Although the final
structure of the photodegraded SQ species is yet to be
disclosed, we have gained some valuable information on how to design
the optimum dye and adjust the reaction conditions within a photocatalytic
system using a photodegradable organic antenna. We also found that
several conditions should be considered and tuned for the long-wavelength
photosensitization of the squaraine antenna including solvent-sensitive Vfb of TiO2, the chemical binding
ability of the organic sensitizer on the TiO2 surface,
environmentally sensitive photostability of organic photosensitizers,
and reducing power of electron donors. The optimization of this hybrid
system with further structural modification of the squaraine dye combining
new alternate electron donor/acceptor building units is currently
under investigation. We believe that the development of a highly active
photocatalytic reduction system with excellent durability is possible
through the use of this molecular engineering.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
and Characterization
Two squaraine dyes (SQCA and SQPA) were synthesized following the synthetic procedure
(see Schemes 2 and
S1 of the Supporting Information).27,48fac-[Re(4,4′-bis-(diethoxyphosphorylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3Cl] (Re(I))26 and the sacrificial
electron donor (BIH)56 were prepared according
to the method reported in the previous research.

SQPA
SQCHO (0.390 g, 0.554 mmol)
and diethylcyanomethyl phosphonate (0.198
mL, 1.11 mmol) were added to a dry round-bottomed flask, which was
then evacuated and filled with nitrogen three times. Next, anhydrous
chloroform (30 mL) was added to dissolve the reactants. After the
addition of piperidine (60 μL), the reaction mixture was then
heated up to reflux for 8 h. Finally, the solvent was removed, and
the residue was passed through silica gel chromatography [dichloromethane/methanol
(10:1 v/v)] in order to obtain SQPE as a blue solid (90 mg, 19%). The purified SQPE (90 mg, 0.104 mmol) was added to a dry
round-bottomed flask, which was then evacuated and filled with nitrogen
three times. Dry CHCl3 (10 mL) was added to dissolve the
reactants. Bromotrimethylsilane (TMSBr) (1.68 mL, 12.8 mmol) was added
dropwise to the reactor containing SQPE. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 12 h. To this solution
methanol (10 mL) was added and stirred for 3 h. The solvent was then
removed, and the residue was passed through silica gel chromatography
(dichloromethane/methanol (5:1 v/v)) in order to obtain SQPA as a blue solid (33.5 mg, 40%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.04 (s, 1H; =CH), 7.90 (m, 1H; Ar–H), 7.68 (m,
1H; Ar–H), 7.63 (m, 1H; Ar–H), 7.56 (m, 1H; Ar–H), 7.52 (m,
1H; Ar–H), 7.36 (m, 3H; Ar–H), 7.19 (m, 1H; 3Ar–H), 5.85 (s,
1H; =CH), 5.82 (s, 1H; =CH), 4.77 (m, 2H; N–CH2), 4.13 (m,
4H; N–CH2), 1.95 (m, 12H; 4CH3), 1.75–1.14 (m, 23H; CH3 + 10CH2), 0.82 (s, 3H; CH3) (PO3H2 resonance not observed). ESI-MS (m/z): calcd for C47H56N3O5PS [M], 805.3678; found [M – H]−, 804.4196.

Preparation of Type I/II Hybrid Catalyst
Two commercially
available TiO2 particles [Degussa P25 (d-TiO2) and Hombikat UV-100 (h-TiO2)] and one homemade TiO2 nanosheet (s-TiO2) were thoroughly washed with
distilled water, ultrasonically treated in water, separated by centrifugation,
and then dried in an oven under N2. Preparation of TiO2/Pt particles: surface-platinized TiO2 particles
(TiO2/Pt, 0.3–1 wt % Pt loading) were prepared by
a photodeposition method as described elsewhere.75 The particles were collected by filtration or by centrifugation
and then dried in an oven under N2. A water suspension
of the TiO2 particles (0.5 g L–1) containing
∼1 M methanol and 0.03–0.1 mM chloroplatinic acid was
irradiated with a 200 W mercury lamp for 30 min. After irradiation,
the Pt-loaded TiO2 powders were separated by centrifugation,
washed with distilled water, dried, and stored under N2 in the dark. The 0.1 g TiO2 or 0.1 g platinized TiO2 (TiO2/Pt) particles dispersed in an MC/MeOH solution
of SQCA or SQPA (2–48 μmol) were allowed to stand
overnight under stirring and then subjected to centrifugation. The
collected particles were washed with the solvent and then dried in
an oven under N2. For Type II hybrid, Re(I) complex was
further chemiadsorbed to the SQ-deposited TiO2 powders for the preparation of SQ/TiO2/Re(I)
(0.1 μmol Re(I) complex loading per 10 mg SQ/TiO2 particles).

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
Suspensions of SQ/TiO2/Pt particles (10 mg
with 0.2–4.8
μmol dye) in 3 mL water containing 0.1 M AscH (pH = 2.66) were
placed in a Pyrex cell (1 cm pass length; 6.0 mL total volume), bubbled
with CO2 for 30 min, and sealed with a septum. A series
of samples were placed on a homemade merry-go-round apparatus and
then irradiated under magnetic stirring with an LED lamp (λ
>500 nm, 60 W, model Fc-6051, Cree Inc.). The amounts of H2 evolved in the overhead space of the cell were determined
through
gas chromatography (HP6890A GC equipped with a TCD detector) using
a SUPELCO Carboxen 1010 PLOT Fused Silica Capillary column.

Photocatalytic
CO2 to CO Conversion
Suspensions
of SQ/TiO2/Re(I) particles (10 mg with 0.8
μmol dye and 0.1 μmol Re(I) complex) in 3 mL DMF/water
mixture solvent (water 2.5 vol %) containing 0.1 M BIH were placed
in a Pyrex cell (1 cm pass length; 6.0 mL total volume), bubbled with
CO2 for 30 min, then sealed with a septum. A series of
samples were placed on a homemade merry-go-round apparatus and then
irradiated under magnetic stirring with an LED lamp (λ >400
or 500 nm, 60 W, model Fc-6051, Cree Inc.). A water solution filter
containing 30 wt % K2CrO4 (1 cm path length
of light) was placed in front of an LED lamp for selective red light
irradiation (>500 nm), 500 nm long-pass. The amounts of gas product
evolved in the overhead space of the cell were determined using gas
chromatography.

AQY Measurement
The AQY Φ(H2) for
photocatalytic hydrogen production was determined for SQPA/TiO2/Pt suspensions; a band-pass
filter (420–450 nm) was used to isolate the 436 nm light from
the emission light of a high-pressure mercury lamp (1000 W, model
6171, Newport Corporation), and the incident light flux was determined
using a 0.2 M ferrioxalate actinometer solution.76 The AQY of H2 formation for the hybrid system
in the presence of 0.1 M AscH was determined in a linear time-conversion
region.

Picosecond Time-Resolved Fluorescence Measurements
Picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements were made using
a commercial picosecond fluorescence lifetime measurement system (Hamamatsu
streak camera, C11200). The light source was a commercial optical
parametric amplifier (TOPAS-prime, Light-Conversion) seeded with a
commercial regenerative amplifier system (Spitfire-Ace, Spectra-Physics)
operating at 1 kHz. The center wavelength and pulse energy were adjusted
to 400 nm and about 1 μJ, respectively. The output was spectrally
filtered by using a pair of prisms. A singlet lens was used to focus
the excitation beam to the sample, and the photoluminescence was collected
in a back-scattering geometry using a parabolic mirror. The emission
was sent to a monochromator and detected with the streak camera. Magic
angle detection was used to avoid the effect of polarization. Widths
(fwhm) of the instrumental response function were about 180 ps in
the 10 ns time window. All the data were acquired in a single photon
counting mode using Hamamatsu U8167 software.
