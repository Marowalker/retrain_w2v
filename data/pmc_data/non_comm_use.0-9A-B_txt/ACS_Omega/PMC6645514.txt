The recent epitaxial
growth of monolayer PtSe2 has raised
hope for its novel applications in valleytronic, spintronic, and energy-harvesting
devices. Compared with 2H-phase transition-metal dichalcogenides,
the 1T-phase PtSe2 is much less studied and this is especially
true for its defects behaviors and their influence on electronic properties.
In this article, we systemically explore the structure, stability,
and kinetics of both Pt and Se vacancies in monolayer PtSe2 using first-principles calculations. By examining the relative energies
of these vacancies, we identify the most stable Se/Pt single and double
vacancies. In particular, we reveal a new type of Se double vacancy
structure with the lowest energy. Energetically, both Se and Pt single
vacancies prefer to combine to form double vacancies. All Se and Pt
vacancies have remarkable influence on the electronic properties.
Moreover, Pt single and double vacancies can introduce strong spin
polarization in PtSe2, which may be promising for spintronic
applications. These findings not only enrich the fundamental understanding
of 1T-phase PtSe2 but also provide useful guidance to design
PtSe2 for its optoelectronic and spintronic applications.

1 Introduction
Stimulated by the fascinating
properties of graphene,1 massive effort
has been made to discover and
synthesize other two-dimensional (2D) materials.2,3 As
a result, many new 2D materials have been made experimentally available.
In general, 2D materials can be classified as elemental and compound
2D materials. Elemental 2D materials can be made from group IV elements,
such as graphene,1 silicene (Si),4−7 germanene (Ge),8−10 and stanene (Sn).11−13 These 2D materials are
metallic and possess a honeycomb lattice and unique linear Dirac cone
in their band structure. Besides, elemental 2D materials can also
be made from group III and group V elements, such as borophene,14−16 phosphorene,17−19 arsenene,20 and antimonene.20−22 It is found that borophene is metallic,14−16 whereas phosphorene,
arsenene, and antimonene are semiconducting.17−22 Beyond elemental 2D materials, various 2D compound materials have
also been synthesized. Perhaps, the most studied family of 2D compound
films is transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),23−26 which is a group of semiconductors
with a band gap of around 2.0 eV, a large on/off ratio of up to 106, and a reasonably good carrier mobility of about 100 cm2 V–1 s–1 at room temperature.23 Undoubtedly, the search for new 2D materials
will continue.

Recently, monolayer platinum diselenide (PtSe2), a new
member of TMDCs with a stable monolayer structure,27,28 has been epitaxially grown successfully on Pt surface.29 Different from other TMDCs synthesized by code-position
of metal and chalcogen precursors, monolayer PtSe2 can
be formed by a single step of direct selenization of Pt(111) substrate.29 It is noted that such a method is compatible
with silicon chip fabrication.30 Interestingly,
bulk PtSe2 is a semimetal, which possesses “type-II”
Weyl fermion,31,32 whereas monolayer PtSe2 is a typical semiconductor with a band gap of about 1.20–2.10
eV, according to different calculation methods.29 Obviously, the electronic properties of PtSe2 can be tuned by layer engineering. In addition, monolayer PtSe2 also shows an excellent photocatalysis capacity, significantly
better than that of traditional PtSe2 nanocrystals.22 Last but not the least, PtSe2 also
shows a high sensitivity in sensing NO2, with an excellent
response time and nearly complete recovery.30,33 Therefore, PtSe2 is highly desirable for novel electronic
and optoelectronic29,34 and catalytic and sensing applications.22,30,33

Previous studies have shown
the prominent presence of various intrinsic
defects and their important roles in affecting the structural stability
and electronic properties of 2D materials.35−38 For graphene and silicene, single
vacancy (SV) and surface adatom were shown to introduce local magnetic
moment, whereas double vacancy (DV) was shown to open a small band
gap.39−42 The study of defects in TMDCs was mainly focused on MoS2.35,37,38 It was reported
that sulfur single vacancy (SV) was the most populous point defect
in monolayer MoS2 obtained by mechanical exfoliation and
chemical vapor deposition, and the density of sulfur-SV could reach
as high as (1.2 ± 0.4) × 1013 cm–2,35 whereas sulfur double vacancy (DV)
and Mo vacancy were also observed, albeit with small concentrations.35,37,38 These defects were shown to greatly
influence the structural stability and electronic properties of monolayer
MoS2.35−38

Similarly, it is expected that defects should also exist in
PtSe2, especially for point vacancies formed during the
epitaxial
growth, and these intrinsic defects may also affect the structure
and electronic properties of monolayer PtSe2. It is noted
that different from 2H-phase MoS2, PtSe2 has
a stable 1T phase. We note, however, that the structure, stability,
and mobility of defects in 1T-phase TMDCs are largely unknown and
their influence on the electronic properties remain unexplored. For
practical applications of PtSe2 in particular, and 1T TMDCs
in general, it is both important and necessary to understand the structure,
stability, and kinetics of defects and their influences on electronic
properties.

In this article, we systematically explore a variety
of vacancies,
including Se/Pt-SV and Se/Pt-DV, in 1T monolayer PtSe2,
focusing on local atomic structure, stability, diffusion pathway,
and energy barrier. To provide guidance for experimental observations,
we also present the simulated scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
images of these defects by ab initio calculations. We also examine
the influence of these defects on the electronic and magnetic properties
of PtSe2. These results not only significantly enrich our
fundamental understanding of intrinsic defects in 1T-phase PtSe2 but also provide possible viable strategies for the control
of vacancy defects in PtSe2 monolayer for novel device
applications.

2 Results
There are
three common phases for monolayer TMDCs, that is, 2H,
1T, and 1T′ (distorted 1T).43−46 Among them, 2H and 1T′
structures and their transition are well studied because MoS2 forms these two phases under different strain and charge doping
conditions.47−50 As shown in Figure 1a,b, PtSe2 takes the distinct 1T phase,28,29 in which Pt atoms form a triangle lattice and the Se atoms occupy
the centers of the Pt triangles alternately above and below the Pt
plane. We have examined the stability of the 2H phase of PtSe2 and found that it is thermodynamically unstable due to the
significant presence of imaginary frequencies in the phonon dispersion.

the (6 × 6) supercell of PtSe2 shown in (a).

Before the structure and property
calculations, we first carefully
test the kinetic energy cutoff for plane waves (Figure 1c) and the number of mesh for sampling the
reciprocal space (Figure 1d). Good convergence is achieved with the energy cutoff of
400 eV and (12 × 12) mesh for the primitive cell [(2 × 2) k-mesh for (6 × 6) supercell]. To avoid the interaction
of vacancies with their images, we choose a large (6 × 6) supercell
with dimensions of (22.485 Å × 22.485 Å). After full
structure relaxation, the band structure of this supercell is calculated
using PBE functional and shown in Figure 1e. It is seen that the PBE calculation gives
an indirect band gap of 1.4 eV, which is 0.2 eV larger than that in
the previous local density approximation calculation but smaller than
that in the previous GW calculation result, which is about 2.10 eV.29 Although the PBE calculation underestimates
the value of the band gap, it is able to give a reliable band alignment
trend compared with the experimental result.29 Besides, GW calculations are computationally too demanding. Hence,
in the present work, all of the electronic properties of defective
PtSe2 are studied on the basis of PBE-level calculations.

2.1 Structure, Electronic Property, and STM Image
of Se-SV
In general, the chalcogen-SV is the major defect
in TMDCs.35,37 Here, we first study the Se-SV, whose optimized
structure is shown in Figure 2a,b. The Se-SV is generated by removing a Se atom. Because
there are two equivalent surfaces of monolayer PtSe2, these
two different surfaces are labeled as top and bottom, as shown in Figure 2b. From the band
structure (Figure 2e), it is seen that there are three defective bands emerging in the
gap zone compared with the band structure of perfect PtSe2 (Figure 1e). The
Se-SV shrinks the band gap of the (6 × 6) supercell of PtSe2 to 0.68 eV, which is nearly half that of pristine PtSe2. Note that the densities of states (DOS’s) show a
similar band gap (Figure 2f). In the defective PtSe2, the valence band maximum
(VBM) is still at Γ point, the same as that of the pristine
PtSe2, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) shifts
to K point (Figure 2e).

of PtSe2 monolayer with local Se-SV defect. The simulated
STM images

The band structure (e) and DOS (f) of (6 × 6) supercell of PtSe2 with one Se-SV defect. Gray, blue, and orange balls denote
the Pt atoms and upper and lower Se atoms, respectively.

To facilitate experimentalists to observe Se-SV,
we simulate the
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images from both top and bottom
sides under −0.5 V bias. Different from dark spots of sulfur-SV
in MoS2,3333 the STM image of Se-SV exhibits some bright spots, which
are originated from the strong localized charges caused by the Se-SV
defect (see the band structure in Figure 2e). From the top side, the STM image has
six spots, which are the six Se atoms around the Se-SV at the top
side (see Figure 2c),
whereas for the bottom side, the three brightest spots come from the
second neighbor Se atoms on the bottom side (labeled as three red
circles in Figure 2a). Inside the three brightest spots, there are also three second
brightest spots corresponding to the three most neighboring Se atoms
on the bottom plane (labeled as blue circles in Figure 2a). It should be noted that STM images reflect
the local density of states of the surface under an external bias.
As a result, the STM images may change under different external biases.
Hence, it is important to choose the bias that includes major defective
levels.

2.2 Structure, Stability, and STM Image of Se-DV
For MoS2, a sulfur-DV forms by losing both upper and
lower sulfur atoms at the same x–y position.50Figure 3a shows the possible Se-DVs by losing the
second Se atom near the first Se-SV in 1T-phase PtSe2 monolayer.
The upper and lower Se atoms are represented by blue and orange, respectively.
The relative energies of these Se-DVs are plotted in Figure 3b as a function of the distance
between the two missing Se atoms. In contrast to the most stable sulfur-DV
in MoS2, which forms by losing two nearest S atoms, the
Se-DV1, which forms by losing the nearest two Se atoms, possesses
the highest relative energy, indicating that it is not energetically
favorable. The DV defect with the lowest relative energy is the Se-DV3,
which is about 0.8 eV lower than that of Se-DV1. The relative energies
for the Se-DV2, 4–6 are in the range of 0.35–0.42 eV
higher than those of the Se-DV3. Hence, our calculations clearly show
that the Se-DV3 is the most energetically favorable DV defect.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic
of the construction of Se-DV by forming the second
vacancy from one of the six possible sites (labeled from 1 to 6) with
different distances from the first vacancy (labeled as 0). The upper
and lower Se atoms are represented by blue and orange, respectively.
(b) The energy difference of Se-DVs as a function of the distance
between the two Se-SVs. The simulated STM images of various Se-DVs
obtained from two sides of the monolayer: (c, d) Se-DV1, (e, f) Se-DV2,
(g, h) Se-DV3, (i, j) Se-DV4, (k, l) Se-DV5, and (m, n) Se-DV6.

We also simulate the STM images
of these Se-DVs. When the atoms
of DV are lost from both upper and lower Se layers, the STMs obtained
from top and bottom sides (see SV in Figure 2b) are identical, as shown in Figure 3c,d for Se-DV1, Figure 3g,h for Se-DV3, Figure 3i,j for Se-DV4, and Figure 3m,n for Se-DV6. If
the two Se atoms are lost from the same side, the STM images obtained
from top and bottom sides are obviously different, as shown in Figure 3e,f for Se-DV2 and Figure 3k,j for Se-DV5. It
is interesting to mention that the STM images of Se-DV1 can be seen
as the overlap of the STM-top (Figure 2c) and STM-bottom (Figure 2d) images. Similarly, the STM images of Se-DV4–6
are also made up of the STM images of Se-SV, except for the STM-bottom
of Se-DV5 (Figure 3l). It should be noted that the STM images for Se-DV2 and Se-DV4
are more complicated, and thus special attention is needed to identify
them.

The relative population of various DVs can be estimated
from exp(−ΔE/kT) for
a given temperature, where ΔE is the relative
energy difference, k and T are the
Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively.
If we take only the six Se-DVs into account, the ratio of Se-DV3 can
be over 99.99% at room temperature and 99.87% at 270 °C (the
growth temperature) among these six DVs. Clearly, the Se-DV3 is the
most populous DV in PtSe2. Here, we would like to examine
its structure and properties in more detail.

The optimized structure
of Se-DV3 is shown in Figure 4a. It is seen that the two
missing Se atoms are located at different Se layers and along the
armchair direction. Figure 4b shows the partial charge density from −0.5 eV to
Fermi level. Compared with the STM images, it is seen that the spots
match with the Se atoms, which are labeled with different sized circles
according to their brightness.

Se-DV, Se-DV3, (b) the partial charge density of Se-DV3 calculated
between −0.5 eV and Fermi energy, the band structure (c) and
DOS (d) of Se-DV3 in the (6 × 6) supercell of PtSe2.

Similar to Se-SV, the VBM of Se-DV3
is at Γ point and the
CBM shifts to K point in the band structure (Figure 4c). The band gap
is reduced to only 0.17 eV, which is much smaller than that of pristine
PtSe2 (1.4 eV). Besides the CBM and VBM, there are four
defective levels in the gap zone compared with the pristine band structures
(Figure 1e). We also
calculate the DOS of Se-DV3 using the tetrahedron method with Blöchl
corrections, and the band gaps obtained from the DOS and band structure
are in good agreement with each other. The significant reduction in
the band gap indicates that the Se-DV is able to greatly alter the
electronic properties of PtSe2.

2.3 Structure,
Magnetic/Electronic Properties
and STM of Pt-SV
Besides the chalcogen vacancies, transition-metal
vacancies were also observed in previous studies on MoS2.35,37,38 Here, we would
like to investigate possible Pt vacancies in PtSe2 monolayer. Figure 5a shows the relaxed
structure of Pt-SV, and the blue zones represent the local spin charge
density originated from the dangling bonds of Se atoms around the
Pt-SV. A large magnetic moment of 6 μB is introduced
by a Pt-SV. As the Pt layer is the middle layer of PtSe2, the STM images obtained from the upper and lower surfaces are identical. Figure 5b shows the simulated
STM image for Pt-SV, where three spots are clearly brighter than others.
It should be noted that the STM image of Pt-SV is similar to that
of the Se-SV from the bottom surface (Figure 2d) but the distance between two brightest
spots in the STM image of Se-SV from the bottom surface is twice that
of Pt-SV. Different from nonmagnetic Se vacancies, Pt-SV shows a strong
spin-polarized band structure and DOS, as shown in Figure 5c,d. The band gap of spin-down
(blue) is only 0.27 eV, whereas that of spin-up (red) is about 1.20
eV. Therefore, it is expected that PtSe2 with a certain
density of Pt-SV may have the potential for spintronic applications.

band structure (c) and DOS (d) of the (6 × 6) supercell of PtSe2, with one Pt-SV defect.

2.4 Structure, Stability, and Property and STM
Image of Pt-DVs
Similar to Se-DVs, we construct the Pt-DVs
by removing the second Pt atom near the existing Pt-SV (Figure 6a). The variation of the relative
energy of Pt-DV with the distance between two Pt vacancies is shown
in Figure 6b. It is
interesting to see that the most stable Pt-DV is the Pt-DV1 formed
by the two nearest Pt vacancies, which is very different from the
scenario of Se-DVs.

Figure 6 (a) Schematic of the construction of Pt-DV with the second
vacancy
located at five possible sites (labeled as 1–5) with different
distances from the first Pt vacancy (labeled as 0), (b) the energy
difference of Pt-DVs as a function of the distance between the two
Pt vacancies. The simulated STM images of various Pt-DVs: (c) Pt-DV1,
(d) Pt-DV2, (e) Pt-DV3, (f) Pt-DV4, and (g) Pt-DV5.

The simulated STM images of Pt-DVs are shown in Figure 6c–g. The STM
image of
Pt-DV1 (Figure 6c)
has four spots brighter than others, and thus the pattern is similar
to that of the Se-DV3 (Figure 3g,h). Hence, during experimental imaging, care should be taken
to distinguish Pt-DV1 and Se-DV3. Except for Pt-DV1, other STM images
can be easily recognized due to the isolated character of two Pt-SVs,
with each having three bright spots. The simple assembly of STM images
of Pt-DV2–6 implies that the interaction of two Pt vacancies
may be greatly screened.

The energy difference between Pt-DV1
and other Pt-DVs (also two
isolated Pt-SVs) can be as large as 1.18–1.22 eV. Therefore,
if the migration of Pt vacancy is easy, the Pt-SVs and other Pt-DVs
would like to form Pt-DV1. We can also estimate the relative ratio
of Pt-DV1 among the five Pt-DVs under the thermodynamic equilibrium
condition. According to the Boltzmann distribution law, exp(−ΔE/kT), the ratio of Pt-DV1 among all of
the explored Pt-DVs is near 100% both at room temperature and 270
°C (the growth temperature) under thermodynamic equilibrium.
Clearly, Pt-DV1 is the most populous of Pt-DVs. Here, we would like
to examine its structure and properties in more detail.

Figure 7a,b exhibits
the top and side views of the atomic structure of PtSe2 with a Pt-DV1 after full energy relaxation. Besides, the charge
distribution at the region between −0.5 eV and Fermi level
is depicted in Figure 6c. Clearly, the charge is localized at Se atoms around the Pt-DV1
and the four atoms that correspond to the four brightest spots in
STM images (Figure 6c) are marked by red circles in Figure 7a.

Figure 7 (a, b) Top and side views of the atomic structure

Pt-DV, Pt-DV1. (c) The partial charge density of Pt-DV1 calculated
between −0.5 eV and Fermi energy. (d) The spin-polarized band
structure and (e) DOS of Pt-DV1 in the (6 × 6) supercell of PtSe2.

Similar to Pt-SV, strong spin
polarization also exists in Pt-DV1.
According to the band structure (Figure 7d), the band gap for spin-down (blue) is
only 0.21 eV, which is much lower than that of the other spin component
(red). This can be verified by the analysis of DOS (Figure 7e). The dispersion of the defective
bands in the band structure is very weak, and VBM is located at Γ
point, whereas CBM is at M point. Therefore, the
Pt-DV1-contained PtSe2 is promising for spintronic applications.
Besides, several defective levels appear in the band gap zone, which
may be used to modulate the optical gap of PtSe2 for optoelectronics.

2.5 Migration Path and Energy Barrier of Vacancies
in PtSe2
The diffusion/migration capacity of point
defects can be dramatically different in different 2D monolayers.36,39−42,51−54 For graphene, the diffusion barrier
for carbon-SV is about 0.94–1.70 eV,39,41 allowing the diffusion during the radiation, such as STM measurement.
However, the transformation energy barriers for different carbon-DVs
can be as large as about 6 eV.24 For silicene40 and phosphorene,53 the migration barrier of SV is very low, which is about 1 order
lower than that of graphene. These low migration barriers enable a
fast diffusion of vacancies in silicene and phosphorene even at room
temperature, making their imaging challenging.54 Compared with these elementary monolayers, the migration
barrier of sulfur-SV in MoS2 can be up to 2.3 eV,36,37 making the diffusion and coalescence of sulfur-SV difficult.

For PtSe2, we first explore the diffusion of Pt-SV. Figure 8 depicts the single
diffusion path and barriers of Pt-SV to its neighboring position.
There is an intermediate state in this diffusion process, whose relative
energy is about 2.15 eV higher than that of Pt-SV. The whole diffusion
barrier is about 2.56 eV. We can estimate the migration frequency
of Pt-SV by  where
ΔE is the diffusion
barrier (2.56 eV for Pt-SV), ν is the vibration frequency of
an atomic bond, which is about 1013 per s, and k and T are the Boltzmann constant and
temperature, respectively. Therefore, the diffusion frequency of Pt-DV
is about 10–30 Hz at room temperature and 10–11 Hz at 270 °C. This means that such a diffusion
process of Pt-SV is difficult under these two conditions. Such diffusion
can only take place under very high temperature, for example, 3 times
per min under 900 K and 100 Hz under 1200 K. It is expected, however,
that PtSe2 may undergo thermal decomposition under such
high temperatures.

Figure 8 Migration path and energy barrier of Pt vacancy in PtSe2 monolayer.

Because of the 1T structure
of PtSe2, the diffusion
of Se vacancy is more complex than that of Pt vacancy. Figure 9a,c,e describes three possible
diffusion paths and related energy barriers of isolated Se vacancy
diffusion in PtSe2. The lowest barrier is 2.17 eV (Figure 9c), which is about
0.39 eV lower than that of Pt-SV diffusion and 0.13 eV lower than
that of sulfur vacancy diffusion in MoS2.3636 However, this diffusion barrier
is still too high. For example, at room temperature, the migration
frequency is as low as 10–24 Hz, indicating that
such diffusion is nearly impossible. Even at 270 °C, the diffusion
frequency is only 10–7 Hz.

Figure 9 Possible migration paths
and energy barriers of Se vacancy in PtSe2 monolayer, (a,
c, e) three possible diffusion paths of isolated
Se vacancy, (b, d, f) three migration paths and energy barriers of
two interacting Se vacancies.

In general, when two single vacancies are close to each other,
their interaction may affect their individual mobility. In the following,
we further explore the migration behavior of two interacting nearest
Se vacancies in monolayer PtSe2. Three possible diffusion
paths are shown in Figure 9b,d,f. It is interesting to see that for the first path, the
diffusion barrier of Se atom in the presence of the second vacancy
nearby is reduced to only 1.30 eV (Figure 9b) from 2.76 eV (Figure 9a). Such an energy barrier reduction is also
observed for the third proposed diffusion path, where the barrier
is 4.25 eV for isolated Se-SV (Figure 9e) and only 2.19 eV in the presence of the second Se-SV
(Figure 9f). In contrast
to the first and third possible paths, the diffusion barrier for the
second pathway is almost unaffected by the neighboring vacancy. Overall,
the diffusion pathway shown in Figure 9b gives the lowest energy barrier for the diffusion,
which is about 1 eV lower than others. Therefore, the diffusion of
an Se-SV in the presence of another Se-SV can be much faster than
that of an isolated Se-SV. For example, the diffusion frequency for
the former is 10 Hz at 270 °C, whereas that for the latter is
only 10–7 Hz. These results indicate the migration
frequency is low for both isolated Pt and Se single vacancy at room
temperature, but the migration of Se single vacancy can be greatly
increased when another neighboring Se single vacancy exists. Moreover,
elevating temperature can also efficiently accelerate the migration.
Migration behaviors revealed here are important for the vacancy annealing,
treatment, and further application of this new 2D material.

3 Conclusions
We have systematically investigated Se
and Pt vacancies in PtSe2 monolayer using first-principles
calculations. We have identified
the most stable Se-SV, Se-DV, Pt-SV, and Pt-DV. Because of the 1T-phase
configuration, the atomic structure of Se-DV in PtSe2 is
quite different from that of the previously reported sulfur-DV in
2H-phase MoS2. Both Se-SVs and Pt-SVs prefer to combine
together to form DVs. All Se and Pt vacancies have remarkable influence
on the electronic properties. Moreover, Pt-SV and Pt-DV can introduce
strong spin polarization. Thus, PtSe2 containing a certain
amount of Pt vacancies may be promising for spintronic applications.
These findings are potentially useful for engineering the electronic
and magnetic properties of PtSe2 monolayer for applications
in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

4 Methods
Ab initio calculations were performed using spin-polarized density
functional theory and plane wave pseudopotential technique, as implemented
in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.55,56 Generalized gradient approximation with the PBE functional57 was adopted to describe the exchange–correlation
interaction. The core electrons were described by the projected augmented
wave potentials.58 During all calculations,
the kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV for the plane wave basis and the
convergence criterion of 10–5 eV for total energy
were carefully tested and used.

The primitive cell of PtSe2 was fully relaxed in terms
of lattice constants and atomic positions. Thereafter, a large (6
× 6) supercell of PtSe2 (22.485 Å × 22.485
Å) with a vacuum space of 25 Å thickness was built to investigate
the influence of various local defects. Starting from the prefect
PtSe2 sheet, the initial vacancies were created by removing
selected lattice atoms systemically. Then, the atomic positions were
fully relaxed with γ point sampling as the supercell is very
large. After geometry optimization, accurate total energies were calculated
with both γ and (2 × 2) k-mesh. The minor
energy difference between γ and (2 × 2) k-mesh can be ignored. The electronic property calculations were performed
with denser k-mesh.

To simulate the defect
diffusion behavior in PtSe2,
the climbing-image nudged elastic band (cNEB) method59,60 was employed to search the diffusion path and energy barrier. During
geometry optimizations and cNEB search, the force criterion for structure
optimization and cNEB search was set to 0.02 eV Å–1. The STM simulations were obtained using the Tersoff–Hamann
approximation,61 with a constant distance
of about 2 Å from the surface.
