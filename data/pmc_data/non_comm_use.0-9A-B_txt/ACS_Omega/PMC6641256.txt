Porous organic polymers (POPs) as
absorbing materials have attracted
increasing attention. Here, we report a new approach to prepare these
polymers for selective oil absorption from oil/water mixtures. Perfluoroalkylbis(diaryldiazomethane)
was synthesized and used to modify the surface of an electrospun gelatin
membrane by a carbene insertion reaction, not only to immobilize the
porous network morphology by cross-linking but also to introduce perfluoroalkyl
groups for oil/water separation. The membrane was characterized to
show its surface and bulk properties, as well as its performance for
absorption capacity, selectivity, and renewability. This approach
offers a new horizon in the preparation of POPs for oil/water separation.

1 Introduction
Absorbent
materials have attracted much attention because of their
wide range of applications in catalysis,1,2 sensors,3,4 gas storage5 and separation,6 drug delivery,7,8 and oil/water
separation.9,10 In particular, materials for
selective oil absorption are gaining more and more attention on account
of marine oil spills,11 which due to increasing
environmental pollution is now a global issue.12,13 Unlike traditional remediation pathways which have serious limitations,14,15 selective absorbent materials would not only clean the water but
also allow the possibility to recycle the oil and generate an economic
return.16,17 There is one kind of oil/water separation
material that has the ability to selectively absorb water, which offers
the possibility for the demulsification of oil, and which is an economic
and efficient way to prepare and purify the crude oil.18,19 However, the preparation of these water-absorbent nanocomposite
materials is usually complicated and costly, and this along with their
inferior performance has limited their applications on the industrial
scale.

Nowadays, many porous organic polymers (POPs) such as
covalent
organic frameworks,20 conjugated microporous
polymers,21 hypercross-linked polymers,22 polymers of intrinsic microporosity,23 and porous aromatic frameworks24 have been used as absorbent materials because of their
lightweight and versatility. However, there are still two severe shortcomings:
First, most POPs with diverse well-defined nanomorphology cannot be
easily achieved because the introduction of cross-linkers or grafted
templates limits the processability of the resulting polymers. Second,
it is difficult to prevent changes to the desired nanomorphology.
As a result, great efforts have been made to fabricate nanomorphology-persistent
POPs via various cross-linking strategies.25

Electrospinning is a simple and versatile technique for the
construction
of polymers with expanded surface area and is achieved by fabricating
a continuous and nonwoven netlike structure of nanofibers.26,27 Recently, Liu et al.28 developed an approach
to prepare electrospun nanocomposites with a high surface area and
controlled macroscopic shape. Using this approach, we fabricate a
porous structure of the gelatin nanofiber membrane via electrospinning
and the subsequent introduction of carbene insertion modification
gives a structure with cross-linked gelatin fibers, in which the fiber
morphology is maintained along with the newly endowed hydrophobicity.
This provides a new way to prepare absorbent materials for oil/water
separation and further expands the application of carbene chemistry
in materials, which have already been used for the introduction of
color,29,30 hydrophobicity,31,32 antibacterial activity,33,34 fluorescence,35 and payload delivery.36,37

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of Diazomethane and Its Reactivity
As shown in Scheme 1, 4-phenoxyaniline was reacted
with 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl
iodide to give compound 1, which was subsequently reacted
with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) to give amide 2, and converted to ketone 3 by Friedel–Crafts
reaction.38 The ketone group of 3 was treated with hydrazine monohydrate to give hydrazone 4, which was oxidized with MnO2 to give bis(diaryldiazomethane) 5. The reactivity of diazomethane 5 was assessed
by treatment with acetic acid and compared with the reported diazomethanes,
before being used for modification. In Figure 1, clear changes of UV spectra at 528 nm appeared
after acetic acid was added and this peak was suitable to calculate
the reaction rate. According to the method in the literature, the
reaction rate of diazomethane 5 was determined to be
1.34 × 10–2 s–1, which was
very similar to the nonfluoro diazomethane.33 This demonstrated that diazomethane could be easily converted into
carbenes under UV light39 and efficiently
reacted with gelatins to introduce perfluoroalkyl groups onto the
surface. In addition, different reactivities between diazomethane 5 and reported fluoro-diazomethanes31 are noteworthy, which might be attributed to the separation of the
diazo group and the perfluoroalkyl group.

of diazomethane 5 with

2.2 Preparation and Modification of Gelatin Membranes
Generally, there are three main advantages of electrospun nanofibrous
membranes of the gelatin as a liquid carrier. First, its fibrous morphology
gives a large surface area that is necessary for liquid absorption.
Second, abundant hydrogen bonds among polymer chains lead to effective
and efficient absorption of polar liquids. Third, it is easy for the
gelatin to be obtained from waste or food by-products. However, there
is one serious disadvantage which limits its application for oil absorption;
it is strongly hydrophilic so that it has poor oil selectivity. Therefore,
a surface modification of the gelatin membrane was introduced according
to the idea of “phase-selective organogelators”,9,40,41 which had a hydrophobic surface
to prevent water from entering and a lot of hydrogen bonds to expand
the oil-absorbing capacity. That is, the surface modification of the
gelatin membrane is required to (i) make it sufficiently hydrophobic
to avoid water absorption and immobilize the selectively absorbed
oil and (ii) maintain its porous morphology and hydrogen bond structure
to give a large oil absorption capacity among the fibrillar network.
To meet these two requirements, the gelatin membrane was fabricated
via electrospinning, followed by its modification and cross-linking
with perfluoroalkyldiazomethanes.

As shown in Figure 2(1), the electrospun gelatin
membrane showed an interconnected and continuous morphology with a
nanofibrous structure. The membrane was immersed into a solution of
diazomethane 5 in dichloromethane (DCM) and dried under
nitrogen flow. The gelatin was completely wetted but did not dissolve
at all in DCM, which was very important because the membrane would
maintain its original structure during the loading process of diazomethanes.
The loaded membrane was then irradiated under UV light to generate
carbenes and accomplish the modification through the X–H (X
= C and N) insertion of carbene onto the surface. The modified membrane
showed a unique network morphology, which is shown in Figure 2(2).

Figure 2 SEM pictures of electrospun
gelatin membranes: (1) pure gelatin
and (2) modified gelatin.

2.2.1 XPS Analysis
As for the chemical
composition on the surface of the gelatin, the modified membrane should
be very different from the pure membrane and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was carried out to explore these differences. Compared
with those in Figure 3(1), the characteristic peaks of fluorine (F 1s at 688.60 eV) in Figure 3(2) confirmed the
existence of perfluoroalkyl groups on the surface of modified gelatin.
Moreover, the percentage of nitrogen was lowered on the surface of
the modified gelatin because the modification layer derived from diazomethane 5 covered the amino acid residues of the gelatin that contain
high levels of nitrogen. Figure 3(3,4) shows the C 1s spectra of gelatin membranes before
and after modification, from which the peaks of CF2 (291.55
eV) and CF3 (293.90 eV) were clearly found. These two peaks
also proved that the gelatin had been successfully modified. In addition,
the peak area ratio of CF2 to CF3 was 4.93,
which was in accordance with the chemical structure of perfluoroalkyl
groups.

Figure 3 XPS spectra of pure gelatin and modified gelatin: (1) survey of
pure gelatin; (2) survey of modified gelatin; (3) C 1s spectra of
pure gelatin; and (4) C 1s spectra of modified gelatin.

2.2.2 Contact Angle Analysis
Water contact
angle was measured to evaluate the wetting property of the modified
surface. Pure gelatin is hydrophilic (water contact angle, 57°)
and may even dissolved by water drops if the test time is prolonged.
However, the water contact angle of modified gelatin membrane 6 was increased to 132°, demonstrating the presence of
the perfluoroalkyl groups which have a low surface free energy. The
contact angle of peanut oil (γ = 2.87 × 10–2 N m–1) was also measured for the modified gelatin
membrane, which was determined to be lipophilic with a contact angle
of 35°. These data proved that the modified gelatin membrane
was suitable for oil absorption because of its hydrophobicity and
lipophilicity. Moreover, a further treatment by diazomethane cross-linked
the gelatin membrane and made it insoluble in water, which was very
different from the pure gelatin.

2.2.3 Pore
Area and Pore Size
The surface
area of gelatin before and after modification was tested by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, which was found to be varied slightly from 3.82 to 3.45
m2 g–1. This result confirmed that the
porous structure via electrospinning was maintained after modification.
However, BET method is normally just suitable for nanosized porous
materials. For the nanofibrous gelatin containing micrometer pores,
mercury porosimeter method should also be conducted to characterize
the surface property, such as total pore area, porosity, and pore
size distribution. It was determined that total pore area varied from
6.65 to 2.06 m2 g–1 and porosity varied
from 81.9 to 56.1% after modification, which indicated that parts
of the initial macropores might disappear. The curve of pore size
distribution is shown in Figure 4. There are two peak regions for the pure gelatin membrane.
One is very sharp with the peak value of 831 nm, and the other is
a broad peak region of 5 × 103 to 6 × 104 nm. After modification, the sharp peak shifted to 1323 nm
and the broad peak region almost disappeared, which was in accordance
with the reduction of total pore area and porosity.

Figure 4 Curve of pore size distribution
before and after modification.

2.2.4 Tensile Test
Because the backbone
of the gelatin membrane is hydrophilic and its surface is hydrophobic,
any crack on the surface or exposure of backbones might do harm to
its oil absorption. Therefore, the tensile test via a static mechanical
analyzer was used to characterize its mechanical property. The stress–strain
curve of the gelatin membrane at room temperature (rt) is shown in Figure 5, which illustrated
a large difference after modification and cross-linking. The tensile
strength of the pure gelatin electrospun membrane was very low, which
indicated hard polymer behavior. However, after being treated with
diazomethanes, the gelatin membrane showed higher tensile modulus
and bigger elongation at break. That is, the treatment of the membrane
with diazomethanes enhanced the bending strength and fracture toughness
simultaneously, so as to guarantee a long service life for oil absorption.

Figure 5 Stress–strain
curve of pure gelatin and modified gelatin.

2.3 Application of Oil/Water Separation
As known to all, the pure gelatin membrane is very loose and easy
to be dissolved in water. When it was added to the peanut oil/water
mixture, the membrane was dissolved completely after being shaken
for sometime and the peanut oil was clearly seen as the upper liquid
in Figure 6(1). In
contrast to that phenomenon, the modified gelatin membrane was not
dissolved in the oil/water mixture. After being shaken, the membrane
was still floated on the partly emulsive mixture (Figure 6(2)). The upper oil layer was
then completely absorbed into the membrane only after 3 min (Figure 6(3)).

Figure 6 Photos of selective oil
absorption: (1) pure gelatin membrane in
the oil/water mixture; (2) modified gelatin membrane in the oil/water
mixture, 0 min; and (3) modified gelatin membrane in the oil/water
mixture, 3 min.

2.3.1 Absorption
Capacity and Universality
Using the mixtures of water with
various organic liquids such as
methanol, glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, peanut oil, petrol, and diesel,
the application of the gelatin membrane was investigated so as to
expand the universality of this selective absorption. As shown in Figure 7, the membrane could
absorb a wide range of organic liquids with rather large capacity
(5.6–8.1 times larger than its own weight), indicating its
distinguish advantages in oil/water separation. This data could be
compared with some common absorbing materials, such as polystyrene
fibers (7.1 times),42 polypropylenes (7–10
times),43 silane-coated polyurethane (PU)
sponges (10–12 times),44 and Fe/C
nanocomposites (4.5–7.5 times).45 Moreover, some more expensive materials might have better absorbing
property, such as carbon nanotube-coated sponges (15–25 times),46 graphene oxide-modified PU foams (26–41
times),47 and boron nitride nanosheets
(20–33 times).48 It is noteworthy
that the oil/water/surfactant mixture is likely to form an emulsion
that makes the oil separation more difficult. By contrast, when the
gelatin membrane was put into the emulsion of water/oil/TWEEN 80 (9:1:1,
mass ratio), it still absorbed the peanut oil effectively, which was
very useful for the real field application.

Figure 7 Mass ratio of the absorption
of various solvents and oil in water.

2.3.2 Absorption Selectivity and Water Repellency
It was noteworthy that when organic liquids were selectively absorbed
from the oil/water mixtures, the water absorption of the membrane
should be fully blocked to enhance the absorption selectivity. To
determine its selectivity, the absorbed gelatin membrane with peanut
oil was extracted with cyclohexane; the oil was easily extracted into
the cyclohexane layer and purified by rotary evaporation under vacuum.
According to that, the selectivity of oil absorption, which was named
recovery efficiency, was determined to be 98%. This data could be
compared with some typical absorbing materials, such as filter paper
(91%),49 cotton fabric (97.8%),50 and graphene oxide-modified PU foams (93.8%).47 Moreover, long-time water repellency was measured
by immersing the membrane into water and weighing at regular intervals.
According to the comparison of the increased mass to the original
mass, the percentage of water absorption was determined and shown
in Figure 8. It was
found that the membrane absorbed a little water after one day, and
then the absorption rate slowed down and ultimately held the value
of 9.0%. Even so, the absorption rate of oil was much faster than
that of water, which indicated excellent absorption selectivity.

Figure 8 Water
absorption of the gelatin membrane over time.

2.3.3 Recovery Ability and Gelatin Leakage
It is very important for the gelatin membrane to be reused efficiently
during the real application. Therefore, the gelatin membrane was recycled
five times, and the recovery efficiency of each circulation was measured;
the results are shown in Figure 9. It was found that although the recovery efficiency
of the membrane gradually lowered with the number of cycles, the material
still showed good absorbing ability (92–98%) after five times
recycling. Moreover, the leakage of gelatin was another important
factor to evaluate the recovery ability. It was shown in Figure 9 that the leakage
of gelatin increased from 0.9 to 4.4% after five times recycling,
which showed good recovery ability for oil/water separation.

and gelatin leakage of the membrane after recycling.

3 Conclusions
Gelatin
was fabricated by electrospinning, modified, and cross-linked
by a perfluoroalkyldiazomethane through a carbene insertion reaction.
This approach gave the gelatin membrane with a porous morphology and
large surface area and with hydrophobicity and lipophilicity properties,
which were proved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), XPS, BET,
mercury porosimeter, contact angle test, and tensile test. This unique
structure made the electrospun gelatin membrane suitable for selective
oil absorption and immobilization. The oil uptake ratio and recovery
test showed that the membrane had good absorption capacity, selectivity,
and recovery ability. This discovery established a general way to
prepare POPs with hydrophobicity and lipophilicity, which were expected
to have wide applications on oil/water separation.

4.3 Kinetic Studies
A series of diazomethane 5 solutions in DCM (2.0 × 10–2, 1.5
× 10–2, 1.0 × 10–2,
5.0 × 10–3, and 1.0 × 10–2 mol L–1) were prepared to obtain UV spectra. The
relationship between UV absorbance and concentration was recorded
and fitted linearly to calculate the molar absorption coefficient.
This allowed a calibration curve from absorbance to concentration
to be determined, which was necessary for kinetic studies. Then, to
the cuvette with a diazomethane 5 solution (1.3 ×
10–2 mol L–1) were added two drops
of acetic acid (about 20 times excess). The mixture was immediately
scanned by the UV spectrometer at regular intervals (15 s) until adequate
spectra were recorded for the calculation of the reaction rate (25
°C, in CH2Cl2).

4.4 Preparation
of Gelatin Nanofibrous Membranes
Gelatin (8.0 g) was dissolved
in a solution (42 g) of acetic acid/water
(9:1, v/v) at rt to give a light yellow liquid. The solution was added
into a syringe and pumped to a self-made electrostatic spinning machine
with a flow rate of 5 mL h–1. The voltage was 20
kV, and the collection distance was 10 cm. The nanofiber was collected
on the surface of an aluminum foil to form a gelatin membrane, which
was subsequently stored in a vacuum drier. After that, a solution
(0.05 g mL–1, 5 drops ≈ 0.25 mL) of 5 in DCM was dropped onto the surface of the electrospun gelatin
membrane (50 mm × 50 mm × 2 mm). After the solution was
evaporated at rt in the dark, the gelatin fiber was covered with diazomethane.
The mixture was then irradiated under UV light for 10 min until the
color of the membrane changed from pink to orange. The mixture was
filtered, and the solid was washed by DCM five times and dried to
yield the amino-modified gelatin membrane 6.

4.5 Determination of the Ratio of Uptake
Typically, a piece
of cross-linked gelatin membrane was dropped into
organic solvents or oil and stayed for 3 min to achieve absorption
equilibrium. The ratio of uptake qm was
calculated from eq 1. 1  where m0 is the
mass of gelatin before absorption and m1 is the mass of absorbed gelatin.

4.6 Determination
of Recovery Efficiency
The absorbed gelatin was extracted
with cyclohexane (20 mL ×
3) under an ultrasonic oscillator. The organic solution was combined,
concentrated under vacuum, and dried in an oven (80 °C) to obtain
the recycled oil. The percentage of recovery efficiency rm was calculated from eq 2. The solid was directly dried in an oven (80 °C)
and used for another circulation, which was run five times. 2  where m0 is the
mass of gelatin before absorption, m1 is
the mass of absorbed gelatin, and m2 is
the mass of recovered oil.

4.7 Determination of Gelatin
Leakage
As shown in part 4.6, the gelatin membrane was used for oil absorption
and the similar
circulation was run five times. After each circulation, the final
weight of the dried gelatin was measured, which was compared with
its initial weight. Therefore, the percentage of leakage lm was calculated from eq 3. 3  where mn–1′ is the initial mass of gelatin before the nth circulation
and mn′ is the final mass of gelatin
after the nth circulation.
