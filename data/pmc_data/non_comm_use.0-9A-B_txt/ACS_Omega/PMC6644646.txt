Novel coating materials are constantly
needed for current and future
applications in the area of microelectronics, biocompatible materials,
and energy-related devices. Molecular layer deposition (MLD) is answering
this cry and is an increasingly important coating method for organic
and hybrid organic–inorganic thin films. In this study, we
have focused on hybrid inorganic–organic coatings, based on
trimethylaluminum, monofunctional aromatic precursors, and ring-opening
reactions with ozone. We present the MLD processes, where the films
are produced with trimethylaluminum, one of the three aromatic precursors
(phenol, 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol, and 2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde),
ozone, and the fourth precursor, hydrogen peroxide. According to the
in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements, the
hydrogen peroxide reacts with the surface carboxylic acid group, forming
a peroxyacid structure (C(O)–O–OH), in the case of all
three processes. In addition, molecular modeling for the processes
with three different aromatic precursors was carried out. When combining
these modeling results with the experimental research data, new interesting
aspects of the film growth, reactions, and properties are exploited.

Introduction
A
growing interest towards organic and hybrid inorganic–organic
nanomaterials has accelerated the development of various thin film
materials produced by molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques.1−3 As a variation of atomic layer deposition (ALD), the MLD technique
produces thin films from precursor gases by one atomic or molecular
layer at a time. The principles of the technique are the same as for
ALD, as the films are formed by sequential, self-limiting surface
reactions.1,3,4 Compared to
purely inorganic materials, the advantages of organic and hybrid materials
lie in their altered mechanical and physical properties, such as flexibility
and optical or thermal properties. The tailored properties of MLD
films enable the development of novel applications for technical challenges
in catalysis,5 energy storage,6 biomedical materials,7 and microelectronics.8,9

Sufficient vapor pressure
of the precursor is a lifeline for feasible
ALD and MLD processes. With high molecular weight organic compounds,
the vapor pressure is often readily too low, causing difficulties
in MLD processes.10,11 In general, the more the functionalities
and the bigger the compound, the lower the vapor pressure. In addition,
organic compounds and materials do not tolerate high temperatures
(>150 °C) due to facile decomposition, the reason for which
the
deposition temperatures for MLD films are often restricted. Thus,
finding precursors for novel MLD processes with proper temperature
properties is time consuming. Therefore, the ring-opening reaction
is an intriguing approach for enabling the new MLD thin film materials.12−14

In addition to discovering novel MLD precursors, the modification
of existing processes and materials can be beneficial for various
applications. The modification can be achieved with chemical or physical
treatments of the produced film, or with additional precursors altering
the film’s growth and properties during the process. For example,
the effects of hydrogen peroxide as an extra precursor or an alternative
oxidizing agent in the MLD process can produce novel properties for
the coatings. Traditional oxidants and oxygen sources in ALD and MLD
are ozone, O2 plasma, and water. It has been demonstrated
that, for example, Al2O3 deposited by using
TMA + H2O2 is denser and the monolayer growth
initiates faster than the films deposited by using H2O
as an oxygen source.15,16 H2O2 has
been used scarcely as an oxidizer for ALD processes, but hardly ever
for MLD with organic precursors.17,18

Different
molecular modeling techniques can be used to support
experimental characterization of thin film structures and to gain
further insight into deposition mechanisms. Density functional theory
(DFT)-based DMol3 and Turbomole calculations have been used to study
the functionalization of carbon nanotubes via TMA cycles.19 The dissociative reaction of mono(alkylamino)silane
precursors on a hydroxylated SiO2(001) surface has also
been investigated at the DFT level using the Vienna ab initio simulation
package (VASP) simulations.20 Kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations have been used to describe the ALD film growth of
HfO2.21 In the present study,
DFT methods were utilized to study the growth of the MLD layers step
by step at the atomic level.

Previously, we presented novel
MLD processes with monofunctional
aromatic precursors, when TMA, one of the three aromatic compounds
(phenol, 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol, and 2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde)
and ozone were utilized in the three-step MLD process.14 The processes were carried out at low temperatures
(75–100 °C), and the ALD-type film growth was achieved.
Furthermore, we demonstrated the ring-opening reaction between the
aromatic ring and ozone, which introduced new functional groups on
the film surface, thus, enabling the continuous film growth (Figure 1). However, despite
the inclusive analysis and characterization of the films and processes,
questions related to the growth mechanisms and properties remained.
In this work, we utilized DFT modeling for studying growth mechanisms
for all three processes (TMA + phenol + O3, TMA + 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol
+ O3, and TMA + 2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde
+ O3). In addition, in previous studies the role of the
hydrogen peroxide remained unclear. Therefore, we also present the
in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) data for processes
utilizing hydrogen peroxide.

Results and Discussion
In Situ FTIR Characterization
The in situ FTIR spectra
measured after the TMA, aromatic precursor, and ozone pulses were
similar to the spectra obtained during earlier studies with the same
MLD tool and coupled in situ FTIR system.14 Because of the similarity, we can conclude that the MLD tool and
connected in situ FTIR system worked correspondingly to the previous
study. Before the experiment, we expected the effect of hydrogen peroxide
to be relatively minor, because as presented in Figure 1, the opening of the aromatic ring and the
formation of the carboxylic acid end groups are already taking place
with O3.

According to the literature, the reaction
between carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide produces a peroxide
structure i.e., peroxy acids (C(O)–O–OH).25,26 This structure is seen in the spectra (Figures 2–4) as a band with a wavenumber of 1082 cm–1, (C–O–OH).27,28 This band is the strongest
in the spectrum of phenol process, but can be detected with the two
other precursors (3F and 4F) as well.

Figure 2 In situ FTIR averaged out difference spectra
after 200 cycles of
TMA + phenol + O3 + H2O2 pulses at
100 °C onto a Si-wafer.

Figure 3 In situ FTIR averaged out difference spectra after 200 cycles of
TMA + 3F + O3 + H2O2 pulses at 100
°C onto a Si-wafer.

Figure 4 In situ FTIR averaged out difference spectra after 200 cycles of
TMA + 4F + O3 + H2O2 pulses at 100
°C onto a Si-wafer.

Since no new bands are seen in the difference spectra after
the
H2O2 pulse, we conclude that the peroxyacid
is the only new structure formed during the H2O2 pulse. Furthermore, due to the lack of negative absorbance in the
spectra, it can be stated that the carbonyl group (C=O) stretching
vibration from carboxylic acid and carboxylate ion (CO2–) bands (1726, 1610, and 1465–1590 cm–1)
still exist on the film surface, as well as the OH-stretching (3200–3765
cm–1) from carboxylic acid. The difference in the
remaining chain structures between the carboxylic acid and peroxyacid
causes a sift of the band in the area of 1500–1800 cm–1. Although the carbonyl group itself is the same in both structures,
the formed peroxyacid structure has different conjugation and dipole
moment compared with the carboxylic acid. This difference shifts the
band to a slightly lower wavelength (from 1734 to the 1678 cm–1) (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

The investigated aromatic precursors differ from
each other with
a molecular structure and atomic composition. Fluorine atoms in 3F
and 4F molecules are presumably causing variations in the reactions
and structures. For this reason, we wanted to study these molecules
in detail as well, with both in situ FTIR and DFT modeling. In the
case of the 4F process (Figure 4), the carbonyl group (C=O) stretching vibration from
carboxylic acid and carboxylate ion (CO2–) bands
(1726, 1610, and 1465–1590 cm–1) still exists
on the film surface after the hydrogen peroxide pulse, even when averaging
and subtraction has been done. This is probably due to the unsaturated
reactions during the ozone pulse and the formation of carboxylic acids
during the H2O2 pulse. The unsaturated reactions
in the 4F process can result from the variations in the ring opening
and rearrangement of the surface structure. According to the modeling
results, the backbonding of the carboxylic acid to the surface is
different between the processes, and this can cause variations in
the reactions with surface groups and H2O2.
In the case of phenol (Figure 8) and 3F (Figure 9), hydrogen peroxide can react with the surface carboxyl groups
and form the peroxyacid group (C(O)–O–OH). In the case
of 4F (Figure 11),
the hydrogen peroxide does not react presumably with the remaining
C(O)–F group. Even after the possible cleavage of chemical
species (such as trifluoropyruvic acid in Figure 12), because of the ozone pulse, the C(O)–F
group remains at the surface. These variations between all three processes
are seen with changing absorbance in the H2O2 spectra.

The formed peroxyacid structure is adequately stable
to react with
the next TMA pulse, thus, enabling the continuous film growth. According
to the in situ FTIR results, the reaction between the CH3 group (TMA) and the OH group is similar to the carboxylic acid and
peroxyacid. The kinetics of the backbonding of carboxylic acid to
the surface in relation to the next H2O2 pulse
needs further studying. Rearrangement of the surface can occur before
the H2O2 pulse, or these events (backbonding
and formation of the peroxyacid) can overlap.

Molecular Modeling
In the present study, molecular
modeling was also utilized to characterize the formation of the MLD
layers and to assist the interpretation of the experimental findings.
The focus was on the functional groups of the surface and their role
in the growth process of the MLD layers. The study was started by
generating the (100) surface of the silica substrate from the optimized
unit cell of cubic SiO2, the lattice parameters of which
are a = b = c =
0.539 nm and α = β = γ = 90.0°. The thickness
of the generated surface was 1.07 nm (nine Si atom layers), and the
positions of the uppermost Si atoms (a thickness of 0.54 nm) were
allowed to relax (Figure 5a). To describe the surface structure as realistic as possible
and to obtain a surface model for the silica (100) substrate, the
surface was covered with hydroxyl groups, so that each Si atoms had
two hydroxyl groups. The charge neutrality of the structure was obtained
by adding H atoms onto the Si atoms at the bottom of the surface model.
The surface structure was reoptimized (Figure 5b), and this model was used as a surface
model for the deposition studies of precursors. In all calculated
cases, the positions of the bottommost Si atoms of the substrate were
kept constant during the optimizing of the MLD layer.

The deposition of the MLD layer starts with a TMA pulse.
As a result,
an aluminum–methyl (Al–CH3) group-covered
layer structure was obtained that is also detected through in situ
FTIR spectra (Figures 2–4). To obtain the maximum coverage
of Al–CH3 groups (one group per 0.15 nm2) onto the silica (100) surface, the Al–CH3 group
has to be deposited on each Si atoms. On the basis of this, half of
the hydroxyl groups were replaced with Al–CH3 groups,
and half of the hydroxyl groups were kept on the substrate surface
(Figure 5c).

During the next pulse, the aromatic compound (phenol, 3F or 4F)
reacts with methyl (CH3) groups, and methane desorbs from
the substrate surface. It is known that aromatic compounds favor a
tilted bonding geometry towards the substrate of approximately 35°
in the case of polyurea.29 In this case,
the bonding angle varies between 31 and 39° being the smallest
for 4F. This means that only one aromatic compound can settle on the
area of 0.58 nm2 (Figure 6). On this area, there are originally four methyl groups,
and the adsorption of aromatic compounds removes one methyl group
from the surface in the form of methane. As a consequence of the self-organizing
of the Si–O–Al coordination structure, it is possible
that a part of the remaining methyl group may also desorb from the
surface at this stage. However, in our molecular modeling study, it
was supposed that the methyl groups desorb as methane from the surface
during the next ozone pulse. In these studies, the surface was covered
with ozone molecules, and each methyl group was removed as methane
from the surface step by step. Ozone molecules were allowed to participate
in the self-organizing of the Si–O–Al surface structure.
After the desorption of methyl groups, differences were detected in
the coordination geometry of Al atoms. In the case of phenol, the
surface Al atoms reach energetically stable structures as a three-coordinated
form, but those of 3F and 4F appear as four-coordinated complexes
(Figure S2).

the Al–CH3 covered silica
substrate. (a) Phenol, (b) 3F, and (c) 4F. Yellow: silicon, pink:
aluminum, red: oxygen, gray: carbon, white: hydrogen, and light blue:

During the ozone pulse, the opening
of the aromatic rings occurs,
which leads to the formation of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. In the
case of phenol, two ring-opening mechanisms are considered, opening
between the C2 and C3 carbons, and the C3 and C4 carbons (Figure 7). When the surface
Al atoms are three-coordinated, the C2–C3 opening leads to
a 0.24 eV energetically more stable surface structure than the C3–C4
opening. If self-organizing of the Si–O–Al surface structure
has proceeded from the three-coordinated Al atoms to the four-coordinated
Al atoms, the C2–C3 opening leads to an even more stable structure
(2.64 eV) than the corresponding structure with the three-coordinated
Al atoms. The backbonding of carboxyl groups of the ring-opened phenol
to the surface Al atoms is the possible explanation for this (Figure 8). After the ring opening of the phenol, the bonding angle
of the surface species is approximately 50°.

(middle and below) openings of phenol. Yellow: silicon, pink: aluminum,
red: oxygen, gray: carbon, and white: hydrogen.

In the case of 3F, the C2–C3 and C3–C4 ring
openings
were also considered. In both of the surface complexes, the Al atoms
are four-coordinated. Of these complexes, the C2–C3 opening
is 1.87 eV energetically more favorable, because of the backbonding
of the carboxyl groups to the surface Al atoms, as in the case of
phenol (Figure 9). However, without backbonding, the carboxyl
groups are more easily available for the reactions of the next pulse.
The bonding angles of the surface species are about 59 and 68°,
respectively in the C3–C4 and C2–C3 opening products.

layer formed with the C3–C4 (above) and C2–C3
(below) openings of 3F. Pink: aluminum, red: oxygen, gray: carbon,

In the case of 4F, four different ring-opening mechanisms,
C5–C6
(Figure 10a), C4–C5
(Figure 10b), C3–C4
(Figure 10c), and
C2–C3 (Figure 10d) were investigated. When the optimized structures for different
4F-ozone complexes were determined, the C5–C6 coordinated structure
was detected to be energetically more favorable than C3–C4
and C4–C5 structures, but the C5–C6 structure is still
significantly less stable than the C2–C3 structure, whose ring
opening occurs spontaneously. Its energy is 1.54 eV more favorable
than that of the C5–C6 structure without opening.

opening mechanisms of 4F on the substrate surface
in the presence of ozone, and their relative energies calculated using
the surface models: (a) 0.00 eV, (b) 0.21 eV, (c) 0.14 eV, and (d)
−1.54 eV. Pink: aluminum, red: oxygen, gray: carbon, white:
hydrogen, and light blue: fluorine.

In addition to the C2–C3 ring opening, the C5–C6
opening was also determined. The geometry optimized structure indicates
that the backbonding occurs via the carboxyl groups onto the surface
Al atoms (Figure 11) in the case of C5–C6 opening, but
not during the C2–C3 opening. Therefore, the final C2–C3
structure is 1.97 eV less stable than the C5–C6 structure.

MLD layer formed with the C5–C6 (above) and C2–C3
(below) openings of 4F. Pink: aluminum, red: oxygen, gray: carbon,
white: hydrogen, and light blue: fluorine.

In the experiments, the diminishing amount of fluorine on
the MLD
layer was detected in the case of 4F precursors compared with the
3F case, through the original amount of fluorine in the precursor.
Therefore, the second bond cleavage after the initial aromatic ring
opening was also taken into account. It was supposed that after the
ozone pulse, trifluoropyruvic acid (CF3COCOOH) is released
from the 4F species (Figure 12). The release can occur either
in the case of the C2–C3 or C5–C6 ring opening. Energetically,
the release of trifluoropyruvic acid is a very favorable reaction,
because in the case of the C2–C3 opening, the energy released
is −6.59 eV. The result corresponds to the experimental findings
on the chemical composition of the MLD layers.14 Chemical compositions and atomic ratios of the investigated
MLD surfaces after the first MLD cycle are presented in Table 1.

and (b) with the C4–C5 cleavage of 4F. Pink: aluminum, red:

Modeling also explains
the differences between the contact angles
in the previous study.14 With the most
favorable cleavage in the case of 4F, the cleavage of the C5–C6
and backbonding of the carboxylic acid to the surface structure lead
to the surface, where the CF3 group and one fluorine atom
point perpendicularly to the surface, causing the lower surface energy,
more hydrophobic surface, and higher contact angle compared with the
3F process.30,31 In the case of 3F, there is the
CF3 group, but the additional fluorine atom is missing.
Furthermore, the hydroxyl group enhances the hydrophilicity and lowers
the contact angle. In the case of phenol, there is no fluorine atoms
or CF3 groups, but the longer carbon chain balances the
situation with the 3F process.

Conclusions
In
this study, we clarified the role of hydrogen peroxide in four-step
MLD processes with TMA, various aromatic precursors, ozone, and H2O2. We demonstrated peroxyacid formation in the
reaction between carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide and continuation
of the film growth in all three MLD processes. According to the in
situ FTIR measurements, the same peroxyacid structure was formed in
the case of phenol, 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol, and 2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde,
at 100 °C.

To obtain the molecular level view of the growth
of the MLD layers,
we utilized molecular modeling to describe the growth of the MLD layer
step by step. As a result, chemical compositions and atomic ratios
of different MLD layers were obtained. In these studies, the ring-opening
mechanism of aromatic precursors in the presence of ozone was also
considered. The results are consistent with the experimental characterization,
and nicely explain the differences between the detected contact angles.

These results enable the further development of versatile MLD processes
for future materials and applications. However, the relation between
the experimental and modeling results needs further studying, because,
for example, the probability and kinetics of ring opening and backbonding
during the deposition process are still unclear.

Experimental Section and
Theory of Modeling
Deposition Processes and in Situ FTIR Measurements
A home-built MLD tool was connected to FTIR measurement equipment
(Bruker Tensor 27, globar mid-IR source and KBr beamsplitter, Germany).
Si wafers (100) were used as substrates. Four-step (ABCD) processes
were constructed from TMA (99.999% SAFC), ozone (generated by a IN
USA, Inc. ozone generator from 99.99% O2), hydrogen peroxide
(50 wt % in water, Sigma-Aldrich), and aromatic precursors including
phenol (>96% Sigma-Aldrich), 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol (99% Sigma-Aldrich)
(3F), and 2-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde (98% Sigma-Aldrich)
(4F). TMA was evaporated at room temperature and held in a metallic
container. Phenol and 3F were evaporated at 80 °C and 4F at 60
°C. An in situ FTIR measurement was carried out after every precursor
pulse. For each of the three processes, 150 cycles were deposited
at 100 °C. No carrier gas was used.

Molecular Modeling
Molecular modeling methods based
on density functional theory (DFT) were used to generate the structure
of the silica (100) substrate and to investigate the formation of
MLD layers from monofunctional aromatic precursors via ring-opening
reactions using phenol, 3F, and 4F together with TMA and ozone (O3). The calculations were performed with the CAmbridge Serial
Total Energy Package (CASTEP)22 code implemented
into Materials Studio version 8.0 (Dassault Systèmes).23 The modeling is based on solving the total electronic
energy and overall electronic density distribution to define the energetically
stable structures.24 The exchange–correlation
was described with generalized gradient approximation Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof.
As a compromise between the accuracy and computational time of calculations,
the ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used for each element. The used
potentials were Al_00PBE.usp for aluminum, C_00PBE.usp for carbon,
F_00PBE.usp for fluorine, H_00PBE.usp for hydrogen, O_soft00.usp for
oxygen, and Si_soft00.usp for silicon. The kinetic cut-off energy
for a plane wave expansion of the wave function was 300 eV.
