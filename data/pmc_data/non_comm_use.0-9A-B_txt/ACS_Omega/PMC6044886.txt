Delivery of hydrophobic materials
in biological systems, for example,
contrast agents or drugs, is an obdurate challenge, severely restricting
the use of materials with otherwise advantageous properties. The synthesis
and characterization of a highly stable and water-soluble nanovesicle,
referred to as a quatsome (QS, vesicle prepared from cholesterol and
amphiphilic quaternary amines), that allowed the nanostructuration
of a nonwater soluble fluorene-based probe are reported. Photophysical
properties of fluorenyl–quatsome nanovesicles were investigated
via ultraviolet–visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy
in various solvents. Colloidal stability and morphology of the nanostructured
fluorescent probes were studied via cryogenic transmission electronic
microscopy, revealing a “patchy” quatsome vascular morphology.
As an example of the utility of these fluorescent nanoprobes, examination
of cellular distribution was evaluated in HCT 116 (an epithelial colorectal
carcinoma cell line) and COS-7 (an African green monkey kidney cell
line) cell lines, demonstrating the selective localization of C-QS and M-QS vesicles in lysosomes with high
Pearson’s colocalization coefficient, where C-QS and M-QS refer to quatsomes prepared with hexadecyltrimethylammonium
bromide or tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride, respectively.
Further experiments demonstrated their use in time-dependent lysosomal
tracking.

Introduction
The development of
new organic molecular probes with excellent
photophysical properties and high fluorescence quantum yields is of
considerable interest to many research areas including one- and two-photon
fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence-based sensing methodologies,
and cancer therapy.1−8 However, the hydrophobicity and poor availability in aqueous media
of a preponderance of organic fluorescent molecules often severely
limit their utility in biological applications, instigating a number
of approaches to overcome this challenge.1,9,10 The chemical modification of nonwater soluble
fluorene derivatives, via the addition of carboxylic1 or salicylic acid moieties,11 improved their solubility in biological media, overcoming in part
this drawback. Alternative strategies consist of dispersing the hydrophobic
probes in water as nanoparticles (NPs), for example, or by encapsulation
in micelles,12 conjugation to polymers,
or incorporation in hydrophilic nanostructures.13,14 Here, we present a new strategy to disperse in aqueous media a hydrophobic
fluorene derivative. This strategy consists in the nanostructuration
of the dye in a class of small unilamellar vesicles, referred to as
a quatsome (QS), in which the bilayer membrane is composed of a quaternary
ammonium surfactant and a sterol.15 Quatsomes
are generally very stable, and they have been recently studied and
developed as a multifunctional carrier of bioactive molecules.16

Lysosomes are terminal degradative compartments
of mammalian cells
that play significant roles in cellular metabolism, endocytosis, and
the synthesis/assembly of hydrolases involved in macromolecule digestion.17,18 Dysfunction of lysosomes result in severe problems, including inflammation,
cancer, and specific lysosomal storage disease, among others.19−24 Therefore, efforts have been devoted to design and synthesize effective
fluorescent probes for the study of lysosome trafficking in cancer
invasion and metastasis in recent years.25,26

In this work, a hydrophobic fluorene derivative, DiC18 (Scheme 1), possessing
desirable photophysical properties, was designed and synthesized.
Dye-loaded QSs were prepared by processing the dye along with the
surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or tetradecyldimethylbenzylammonium
chloride (MKC), and cholesterol via a compressed CO2 methodology
named depressurization of an expanded liquid organic solution-suspension
(DELOS-SUSP),27 which leads to the formation
in a single step of a highly homogeneous dispersion of functionalized
quatsomes (<100 nm) in an aqueous environment. DiC18-loaded quatsomes exhibited, in both cases, advantageous photophysical
characteristics and high selectivity for the lysosomes of HCT 116
and COS-7 cells, suggesting their potential as probes for short- and
long-term lysosomal labeling and tracking.

Results and Discussion
Synthetic
Strategy
The synthesis of target compound DiC18 (Scheme 1) began
with 2-bromo-9H-fluorene, which was used
to prepare 2-bromo-7-iodo-9H-fluorene (1) according to a literature procedure.28 Fluorene 2 was obtained from substitution of the 9-position
benzylic hydrogens of 2-bromo-7-iodo-9H-fluorene
with bromoethane.29 The Stille coupling
reaction was performed between 2 and 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)benzothiazole with Pd(PPh3)4,
as a catalyst, to prepare 3. Benzothiazolylfluorene 3 was reacted with N,N-di-n-octadecylamine via an Ullmann coupling reaction to produce
the final product, DiC18, as a yellow oil, which is nonsoluble
in water but highly soluble in organic solvents of different polarities.

Preparation of DiC18-Loaded Quatsomes
DiC18-loaded quatsomes were prepared by the CO2-based method, DELOS-SUSP. First, cholesterol and DiC18 were dissolved in EtOH and then added to a high-pressure vessel,
previously heated at Tw = 308 K. Afterward,
CO2 was added until reaching the working pressure (Pw = 10 MPa), to obtain a CO2-expanded
solution of the compounds. In the last stage, the DiC18-loaded quatsomes were formed by depressurizing the CO2-expanded solution over an aqueous solution of the surfactant (CTAB
or MKC). The obtained samples were then purified by diafiltration
to remove the EtOH and excess surfactant. This procedure enabled the
preparation of aqueous suspensions of quatsomes based on cholesterol
and CTAB, as the surfactant, with DiC18 loadings (molesDiC18/(molessurfactant + molescholesterol)) of 0.9 × 10–3, 7.0 × 10–3, and 1.3 × 10–2 for samples C-QS-1, -2, and -3, respectively. The same procedure
was followed with another quaternary ammonium surfactant, MKC, which
should be more suitable for parenteral drug delivery than CTAB, as
it is more biocompatible obtaining dye-loaded QSs with DiC18 loadings of 0.5 × 10–3, 4.8 × 10–3, and 9.7 × 10–3 for samples M-QS-1, -2, and -3, respectively
(Table S1).

Colloidal Stability and
Morphology of DiC18-Loaded
Quatsomes
Figure 1 shows cryogenic transmission electronic microscopy (CryoTEM)
micrographs of samples C-QS-1, -2, and -3 1 week after their preparation, which appeared mostly of
round-shaped nanovesicles with average hydrodynamic diameters of 70,
58, and 60 nm, as measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (see Table S2), respectively. The zeta potential of
the three samples was higher than 70 mV, and average sizes were maintained
over 2 months, supporting the very high colloidal stability of such
systems (Table S2). No changes were detected
in the morphology of the samples, as shown in the case of C-QS-3 comparing 1 week versus 1 month (Figure 1, right). Similarly to C-QS, M-QS-1, -2, and -3 samples also
possessed good colloidal stabilities.

Figure 1 CryoTEM micrographs of DiC18-loaded quatsomes at increasing
loading of DiC18: (left) C-QS-1; (middle) C-QS-2; (right) C-QS-3 1 week and 1 month after
the preparation. Enlargements of the images are shown in the bottom
part of the picture. The red arrows indicate patchy-quatsomes, whereas
the blue ones indicate other supramolecular organization of DiC18.

CryoTEM images illustrate
that DiC18-loaded quatsomes
constituted a mix of different nanostructures. Interestingly, along
with small quatsomes, the presence of some vesicles with a “patch”
was detected (in all of the cases only one patch per vesicle was detected).
The patches (indicated with a red arrow in Figure 1) can be recognized due to the higher contrast
to electrons in the cryoTEM images. This new structure, named patchy-quatsomes
(patchy-QSs), has not been reported in previously studied quatsomes.15,16,27 The presence of this particular
architecture is attributed to the aggregation on the surfaces of QSs
of the nonwater soluble, nonamphiphilic DiC18 molecules,
favored by the multiple van der Waals interactions among their alkyl
chains and the CH–p
interactions with the aromatic fluorene cores, minimizing the direct
contact of most of the DiC18 molecules with the aqueous
media. It is hard at this time to speculate on the exact composition/structure
of these patches because they can be formed only by DiC18 or a combination of DiC18 and surfactant or cholesterol
molecules that could stick to the QS surfaces providing isolation
from water molecules. Nevertheless, a point worth mentioning of such
new structures is the fact that the presence of patches is advantageous
for optical applications because they enable larger dye concentrations
in aqueous suspensions without quenching or compromising too much
their fluorescence properties (vide infra).

Along with QSs and
patchy-QSs, other sparse nonvesicular structures
were detected, indicated by the blue arrow in Figure 1 (bottom right). These structures, never
detected in the case of plain QSs made with cholesterol and CTAB,
are ascribed to supramolecular assemblies of DiC18 but
were completely isolated and not bound to the vesicles, in contrast
to that observed for patchy-QSs. DiC18-loaded QSs made
with MKC/cholesterol showed similar structures, as shown in Figure S1.

Photophysical Properties
Photophysical properties of DiC18 were investigated
in solvents with different polarities
including DMSO, acetonitrile (ACN), toluene (TOL), dichloromethane
(DCM), cyclohexane (CHX), and hexane (HEX). The linear absorption,
emission spectra, and photophyscial properties of DiC18 are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra for DiC18 displayed
maximum intensity in the range of 387–411 nm, with only nominal
variation as a function of solvent polarities. In comparison, fluorescence
emission of this asymmetrical (D−π–A) compound
results from excitation in the main absorption band, exhibiting a
bathochromic shift with strong solvent polarity dependencies, where
D and A refer to electron-donor and electron-acceptor moieties, respectively,
joined by a π-conjugated structure. DiC18 emission
exhibited a well-resolved vibrational structure with a maximum at
418 nm in a nonpolar solvent (hexane) and was replaced by a broader,
structureless peak with the maximum shifted to 541 nm in a polar solvent
(DMSO). The solvatochromic behavior of DiC18 is consistent
with some other fluorene derivatives that are sensitive to the environmental
polarity.11,30−32 The compound exhibited
excellent quantum yield in different solvents (all close to 1), indicating
that it is a promising candidate for further chemical and biological
applications.

The photophysical properties of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 are summarized in Table 2. The steady-state absorbance, excitation, emission,
and excitation anisotropy of C-QS-1, -2,
and -3 are presented in Figure 3. As a consequence of their nanometric size
distribution, quatsomes scatter light in the ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) range. Especially at low DiC18 loading
(C-QS-1, Figure 3a, and M-QS-1, Figure S2), for which the absorption to scattering ratio is low, the absorption
spectrum may be misinterpreted. For this reason, as well as to have
an estimation of the fluorescence quantum yield of the system, scattering
has been subtracted, as explained in Experimental
Section. The absorption spectra of the other two samples (C-QS-2 and -3) are shown as originally acquired,
without any mathematical treatment. The slight positive solvatochromism
in absorption (from 391 to 394 nm for C-QS-1 to -3) and emission (from 452 to 461 nm for C-QS-1 to -3), as a function of increasing the DiC18 loading in the QSs, suggests a change in the polarity around the
fluorophore.

However,
normalized excitation spectra of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and DiC18 in THF were
well overlapped. The excitation anisotropy of DiC18-loaded
QSs decreased at a higher loading of the dye (Figure 3d), likely as an effect of the homoresonance
energy transfer between DiC18 molecules experiencing
close proximity at higher loadings. The higher anisotropy showed by
the C-QS samples compared to that by DiC18 in glycerol proves that the incorporation in QSs effectively restricted
its rotational diffusion, reducing the possibility of nonradiative
decay. The decrease of quantum yields and lifetime (Figure S2) for QSs with increasing loading of DiC18 further supported the homoenergy transfer process. Absorption, excitation,
and emission spectra of DiC18 nanoparticles, prepared
by reprecipitation, are displayed in Figure S3. In comparison with DiC18-loaded QSs, the emission
band for the NPs exhibited a slight bathochromic shift to 472 nm,
and the fluorescence quantum yield decreased from 0.46 for C-QS-1 to 0.1 for the NPs. The desirable photophysical properties and generally
high quantum yields of DiC18-loaded QSs indicated that
quatsomes are promising vehicles to disperse hydrophobic probes in
aqueous environments, achieving bright and stable fluorescent architectures
that possess significant potential in fluorescence bioimaging. Similar
results were obtained for MKC-based QSs (M-QS, Table 2), and their spectra
are shown in Figure S2.

The optical
stability of the C-QS and M-QS samples was
studied by monitoring their absorption spectra over
time (Figure S4). Notably, no changes in
the absorption bandshapes or in intensities were detected over 2 months,
evidencing the superior stability of these fluorescent nanostructures.

pH Sensitivity Measurements
A primary function of lysosomes
in cells is to work as a digestive system by using an array of enzymes
that are capable of breaking down many types of biological macromolecules.
It is essential for a lysosomal probe to be stable in an acidic environment
because all of the lysosomal enzymes are acidic hydrolases, which
are active at the acidic pH (about 5) that is maintained within lysosomes.17,33 The pH stability of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 was investigated by measuring the steady-state absorption and emission
spectra in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at various pHs.
As illustrated in Figure S6, only small
fluctuations were observed in the absorption and emission spectra,
indicating the good stability of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 over the pH range of 4.10–10.32 (representative
data for C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 are provided).

Cell Viability
To ascertain the potential utility of
fluorescent probe DiC18 and DiC18-loaded
QSs for cellular imaging, cell viability assays in HeLa and HCT 116
cells were conducted via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay.17,31,36Figure S7 shows the viability
data for HCT 116 cells after a 24 h incubation with several concentrations
of DiC18. Low cytotoxicity was observed up to a concentration
of 40 μM. Cell viability experiments in HeLa cells were performed
for C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 (Figure 4). CTAB and MKC are quaternary
ammonium surfactants, and their cytotoxicity to different human cells
was previously reported.34,35 The results show that
the effect of DiC18 loading is negligible, and the cytotoxicity
is governed by the concentration of the surfactant (CTAB or MKC).
Good viability was obtained for C-QS at a concentration
of 0.022 mM CTAB and for M-QS at a concentration of 0.044
mM MKC, respectively.

plain C-QS and C-QS-1, -2,

Cell Imaging and Cellular
Colocalization Study
For
demonstration purposes, fluorescence imaging was performed in an epithelial
colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT 116, for organic probe DiC18 and QS probes C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3. On
the basis of the cell viability test results, 20 μM of DiC18 and various amounts of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 were employed for cell incubation and fluorescence imaging.
Cells treated with DiC18 for 2 h displayed no fluorescence
upon excitation (Figure S8), likely because DiC18, after dissolution in DMSO, underwent aggregation when
diluted by a growth medium and was not uptaken by cells. In comparison,
cells incubated with C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 provided
bright images, manifesting the good biological compatibility of QSs
and the capability of introducing organic fluorescent molecules into
cells for in vitro (Figure 5) or in vivo applications. Images acquired from cells treated
with C-QS-1 and -2 and M-QS-1 and -2 showed weaker fluorescence due to the low loading
of DiC18 in QSs (not shown) and hence studies focused
on C-QS-3 and M-QS-3.

Subsequently, to demonstrate the
cellular distribution of C-QS-3 and M-QS-3, colocalization experiments
were conducted in both HCT 116 and COS-7 cells, two commonly employed
cell lines.17,18,25 The lysosomal marker, Lysotracker Red, and the mitochondria marker,
Mitotracker Red, were employed for comparison to determine potential
organelle selectivity. Fluorescence images collected for cells coincubated
with commercial markers and QSs indicate that the localization of C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 was coincident to that of Lysotracker
Red (Figures 6, 7, S9, and S10). Pearson’s
correlation coefficient, determined using freely available Fiji software,
for C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 relative to Lysotracker
Red was 0.89 and 0.92, respectively, whereas relative to Mitotracker
Red the values were 0.32 and 0.30, respectively, demonstrating high
selectivity toward lysosomes.

Time-Dependent Lysosome
Tracking Experiment
Time-dependent
lysosome tracking experiments were performed to assess the intracellular
retention of quatsome probes in cancer cells.17,25 After a 2 h treatment with Lysotracker Red and C-QS-3 or M-QS-3, HCT 116 cells were incubated for an additional
2, 4, and 6 h, respectively. As shown in Figures 8 and 9, there remained
significant fluorescence in cells 8 h after initial incubation with
the fluorenyl QS probes, maintaining its colocation with lysosomal
markers, suggesting that C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 are promising candidates for long-term lysosomal tracking applications
that can be used for monitoring lysosome distributions, activities,
and related cell death.

Conclusions
A new lysosome-specific fluorescent nanostructured
probe has been
obtained by using quatsomes to stably disperse a nonwater soluble
fluorene derivative (DiC18) in aqueous media. Despite
the morphological heterogeneity, QS probes C-QS-1, -2, and -3 and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 formed patchy quatsomes and exhibited good
stability, both in terms of colloidal and spectral properties, over
2 months. Fluorescence quantum yields were generally high for the
fluorenyl-based probes, and fluorescence anisotropy spectra indicated
that DiC18 exists in a highly anisotropic environment
in the patchy-QSs. The study of their photophysical properties indicates
that these QS nanovesicles are desirable fluorescent probes for in
vitro cell imaging. The cytotoxicity of these patchy-quatsomes was
assessed in HCT 116 cell lines and found to be suitable for fluorescence
image acquisition. Fluorescence microscopy images showed that C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 are two highly selective lysosomal
probes with high Pearson’s correlation coefficients relative
to commercial Lysotracker Red. In conclusion, C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 were useful in time-dependent lysosomal tracking, fulfilling
a number of requirements necessary for an efficient lysosome-selective
fluorescent probe, including high stability and specificity, possibility
of long-term imaging, and pH insensitivity. These properties make
the fluorenyl-loaded QS nanoprobes particularly intriguing candidates
for further studies, such as the inclusion of activities for lysosomal-addressed
drug delivery and photodynamic therapy.

7-(Benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-9,9-diethyl-N,N-di-n-octadecyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine (DiC18)
A mixture
of 3 (0.13 g, 0.3 mmol), N,N-di-n-octadecylamine (0.31 g, 0.6 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (0.020 g, 0.03 mmol), (t-Bu)3P (0.012 g, 0.06 mmol), and t-BuONa (0.058 g, 0.6
mmol) in 5 mL of anhydrous toluene was heated to reflux under N2 atmosphere for 16 h. Toluene was removed in vacuo after the
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The residue was dissolved
with 10 mL of CH2Cl2 and washed twice with 10
mL of brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and
then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified
by flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate/pentane (1/200)
as the eluent, providing DiC18 as a yellow oil (0.22

Preparation of DiC18-Loaded Quatsomes by DELOS-SUSP
DELOS-SUSP, a compressed fluid-based method, was used for the preparation
of DiC18-loaded QSs. Cholesterol (111 mg) was first dissolved
in 4.2 mL of EtOH at a working temperature, Tw (Tw = 308 K), along with a determined
amount of DiC18 (described below and in the Supporting Information). The solution was then
added to a high-pressure vessel (V = 11.8 mL) at
atmospheric pressure and Tw. After 20
min of equilibration, the vessel was pressurized with CO2 at the working pressure, Pw (Pw = 10 MPa), to have an expanded liquid ethanol
solution with a molar fraction of CO2 of XCO2 = 0.63. The reactor was kept at the working
condition for 1 h to homogenize the system. The organic solution was
then depressurized over 35 mL of water, where 100 mg of CTAB (or 202
mg of MKC) had been previously dissolved. N2 at 10 MPa
was added to the vessel during the depressurization in order to maintain
constant Pw inside. The vessel was equipped
with a gas filter, to prevent any unsolved compound present in the
CO2-expanded solution to reach the aqueous solution of
the surfactant. With this one-step method, unilamellar vesicles with
high vesicle-to-vesicle homogeneity were prepared, enabling the straightforward
loading of quatsomes with hydrophobic compounds such as DiC18.

The loading, L, is expressed as the ratio L = molesDiC18/(molescholesterol +
molessurfactant). In the case of QSs made of CTAB/cholesterol
(1:1 molar ratio), three different samples, referred to as C-QS-1, -2, and -3, having L = 0.9, 7, and 13 × 10–3, respectively, were
prepared. In the case of MKC/cholesterol (1:2 molar ratio) QSs, three
samples, M-QS-1, -2, and -3,with L = 0.5, 4.8, and 9.7 × 10–3, respectively, were synthesized. The concentrations of DiC18 in the respective samples were determined as explained in the Supporting Information, whereas the nominal concentrations
of surfactants and cholesterol were used for the determination of L. All samples were purified by diafiltration by using the
Kros Flo Research Iii TFF System (Spectrum Labs)
equipped with an mPES Micro Kros filter column (100 kDa molecular
weight cutoff) to remove ethanol and excess of CTAB or MKC.

Preparation
of DiC18 NPs by Reprecipitation
A solution of
0.5 mM DiC18 in THF was filtered using
a 220 nm pore size Teflon filter, and 100 μL of the filtered
solution was then dropped into 9.9 mL of Milli-Q water at room temperature
under vigorous stirring for 1 h.

Physical Characterization
of DiC18-Loaded Quatsomes
Size and zeta potential
of DiC18-loaded quatsomes
were studied using dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer Nano
ZS, Malvern Instruments, U.K.) with noninvasive backscattering optics,
equipped with a He–Ne laser at 633 nm. All values reported
were the average of three consecutive measurements of the same samples
at 25 °C (standard deviation over the three measurements <7%).
Values were reported as average hydrodynamic diameters ± PDI
(polydispersity index in nm). CryoTEM images were acquired with a
JEOL JEM microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 120 kV. The
sample was placed in a copper grid coated with a perforated polymer
film and then plunged into liquid ethane to freeze it. It was then
placed into the TEM.

Photophysical Properties Measurements
Linear absorption,
fluorescence, and excitation spectra of DiC18, C-QS-1, -2, and -3, and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 were investigated in spectroscopic
grade HEX, CHX, TOL, DCM, ACN, DMSO, glycerol, and Milli-Q water at
room temperature. The steady-state absorption spectra were measured
with a Tecan Infinite M200 PRO plate reader spectrometer in 1 cm path
length quartz cuvettes. The fluorescence and excitation spectra were
obtained using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer.
Solutions studied during all of the measurements had optical densities
less than 0.1. The fluorescence spectra were corrected for the spectral
responsivity of the photomultiplier tube detector. Excitation anisotropy
measurements for DiC18 were performed in a viscous solvent
to impede molecular rotational relaxation. The fluorescence quantum
yields were determined relative to 9,10-diphenylanthracene in cyclohexane
(Φ = 0.95) as the standard.30,32 The values
were calculated according to eq 1 1  where
Φ is the quantum, I is the integrated emission
signal, OD is the optical density at the excitation
wavelength, and n is the refractive index; subscript
“ref” stands for reference sample, “sample”
stands for experimental sample.

It is important to take into
account that at the concentrations studied, Quatsomes scatter UV–vis
light. To accurately measure and calculate the quantum yield for C-QS-1 and M-QS-1 (samples with a low absorption/scattering
ratio), contribution of scattered light was subtracted from the absorption
spectra. The signal detected from the spectrophotometer can be partitioned
into light that is actually absorbed (Acorrected,λ) and the apparent absorption that is due to light scattering at
a given wavelength (ALS,λ). The
apparent absorption spectrum of plain QSs can be modeled with eq 2, in accordance with Rayleigh–Tyndall
approximation 2  where a and n were determined by the least squares fitting
of the measured absorption
spectrum at wavelengths larger than those in which absorption of DiC18 was observed. After scattering subtraction, the condition
Abs333nm = 0.32AbsMAX, verified for C-QS-2 and -3 samples and, therefore, independent of the DiC18 loading, was also verified for C-QS-1.
However, owing to this mathematical treatment for scattering removal,
the fluorescence quantum yield of C-QS-1 shall be considered
as an approximated value and simply used for comparison purpose with
the other samples studied.

pH Stability Measurements
The steady-state
absorption
spectra of C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 at various
pHs in the PBS solution were recorded using a Tecan Infinite M200
PRO plate reader spectrometer in 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes.
Likewise, pH-dependent fluorescence spectra were obtained using an
Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer.

Cell Viability
To assess the cytotoxicity of DiC18, C-QS-1, -2, and -3, and M-QS-1, -2, and -3,
HCT 116 and HeLa cells were cultured in the minimum Eagle’s
essential medium (MEM) and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) cell medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
1% penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were placed in 96 well plates and incubated until there were
no fewer than 6 × 103 cells per well for the experiments.
Next, HCT 116 cells were incubated with different concentrations of DiC18 (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for an additional
22 h. HeLa cells were incubated with different concentrations of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 (0.022, 0.044,
0.088, 0.175, 0.35, and 0.70 mM) and M-QS-1, -2, and -3 (0.044, 0.088, 0.18, and 0.35 mM) for an additional
22 h, where the values within parentheses refer to the nominal concentrations
of the surfactants. After that, 20 μL of the CellTiter 96 Aqueous
One solution reagent (for MTS assay) was added into each well, followed
by further incubation for 2 h at 37 °C.17,31,36 The respective absorbance values were read
on a Tecan Infinite M200 PRO plate reader spectrometer at 490 nm to
determine the relative amount of formazan produced. Cell viabilities
were calculated on the basis of the following equation (eq 3) 3  where Abss490nm is the
absorbance of the cells incubated with different concentrations of
experimental probe solutions, AbsD490nm is the
absorbance of cell-free well containing only dye at the concentration
that was studied, Absc490nm is the absorbance
of cells only incubated in the medium, AbsD2490nm is the absorbance of the cell-free well.

Cell Imaging
HCT
116 cells were placed onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips
and transferred into 24-well glass
plates (5 × 104 cells per well), and incubated for
48 h before incubating with the quatsome. A stock solution of the
fluorescent probe of DiC18 dissolved in DMSO was prepared
as a 2 mM solution. The solution was diluted to 5, 10, 15, and 20
μM by the complete growth medium, DMEM, and freshly incubated
with HCT 116 cells for 2 h. After incubation, the dye solutions were
extracted and the coverslipped cells were washed twice with the PBS
solution. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in
the PBS solution for 10 min. The fixing agent was extracted and washed
twice with PBS. To reduce the autofluorescence, a fresh solution of
NaBH4 (1 mg/mL) in the PBS buffer was used to twice treat
the fixed cells for 10 min. The coverslipped cells were then washed
twice with PBS and then with deionized (DI) water and mounted on microscope
slides using an antifade mounting media (Prolong Gold).

Stock
solutions of C-QS-1, -2, and -3 were diluted to a nominal concentration of 0.022 μM of CTAB
by the DMEM cell medium, whereas stock solutions of M-QS-1, -2, and -3 were diluted to a nominal
concentration of 0.044 μM of MKC by the DMEM cell medium. The
incubation and fixation procedures were repeated for these six experimental
solutions. Fluorescence microscopy images were observed and recorded
on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70) equipped with a QImaging
cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) and a 100 W mercury lamp. To improve
the fluorescence background-to-image ratios, fluorescence images were
obtained using a customized filter cube (Ex: 377/50; DM: 409; Em:
460/60).

Colocalization Study
To investigate the efficiency
and specificity of C-QS-3 and M-QS-3, HCT
116 and COS-7 cell lines were employed. All cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips at the density of 4 × 104 cells per well and incubated for 48 h. Stock solutions of C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 dissolved in DI water were
prepared at a nominal concentration of 1 mM. Lysotracker Red DND-99
(LT Red) was purchased as a 1 mM stock solution in anhydrous DMSO,
and MitoTracker Red FM (MT Red) containing 50 μg of lyophilized
solid per vial was dissolved in 69 μL of DMSO and prepared as
a 1 mM stock solution. For coincubating cells with C-QS-3 or M-QS-3 and LT Red, the stock solution was diluted
to 0.022 mM for CTAB and 0.044 mM for MKC and 75 nM LT Red with the
DMEM cell medium and freshly placed over cells for a 2 h incubation
period. For coincubating cells with C-QS-3 or M-QS-3 and MT Red, the stock solution was diluted to 0.022 mM for CTAB
and 0.044 mM for MKC with the DMEM cell medium and freshly incubated
with cells for 2 h, followed by incubation with 400 nM MT Red in the
DMEM cell medium for an additional 45 min. Cells were washed twice
with PBS and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for
10 min. The fixing agent was extracted and washed twice with PBS.
A fresh solution of NaBH4 (1 mg/mL) in PBS was used to
twice treat the fixed cells for 10 min. The coverslipped cells were
then washed twice with PBS and then with deionized water and mounted
on microscope slides using an antifade mounting media (Prolong Gold).
Fluorescence images of the fixed cells were obtained using a customized
filter cube (Ex: 377/50; DM: 409; Em: 460/60) for C-QS-3 and M-QS-3; a Texas Red filter cube (Ex: 562/40; DM:
593; Em: 624/40) was employed for Lysotracker Red and MitoTracker
Red FM imaging. Pearson’s correlation coefficient for C-QS-3 and M-QS-3 was calculated using Fiji,
a freely available image processing software.

Time-Dependent Lysosome
Tracking Experiment
To track
the QS probe cellular distribution in cancer cells, HCT 116 cells
were placed onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and transferred
into 24-well glass plates (5 × 104 cells per well)
and then incubated for 48 h before incubating with the QS probe. The
stock solution was diluted to a final concentration (0.022 mM for
CTAB and 0.044 mM for MKC) and 75 nM LT Red with the DMEM cell medium.
Cells were incubated with solutions for a 2 h incubation period and
washed thoroughly and then incubated with fresh DMEM medium for an
additional 2, 4, and 6 h. After incubation, cells were washed twice
with PBS and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for
10 min. The fixing agent was extracted and washed twice with PBS.
A fresh solution of NaBH4 (1 mg/mL) in PBS was used to
twice treat the fixed cells for 10 min. The coverslipped cells were
then washed with the PBS buffer twice and then with deionized water
and mounted on microscope slides with Prolong gold mounting media.
Fluorescence microscopy images were recorded on an inverted microscope
(Olympus IX70) equipped with a QImaging cooled CCD and a 100 W mercury
lamp. Fluorescence images of the fixed cells were taken using a customized
filter cube (Ex: 377/50; DM: 409; Em: 460/40) for C-QS-3 and M-QS-3; a Texas Red filter cube (Ex: 562/40; DM:
593; Em: 624/40) was utilized for imaging Lysotracker Red.
