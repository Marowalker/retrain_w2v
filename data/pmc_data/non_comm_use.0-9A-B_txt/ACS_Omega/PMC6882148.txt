Several procedures were employed in the preparation of
different Pd- and Fe-based catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) via
the normal wet impregnation method, reverse filtration of a microemulsion,
sputtering method, and the precipitation of a Fe complex. Depending
on the chosen procedure, the metal active phase can be found on the
exterior and/or interior part of the CMR or even in its pores in concentrations
between 0.05 and 2 wt %. Moreover, we have managed to implement a
unique systematic process to grow hydrotalcite in the pores of a Pd-CMR.
To exemplify the activity of these new CMRs, we have tested them in
the peroxidation of phenol and in situ epoxidation of trans-chalcone.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Over decades, chemistry
and chemical engineering have been developed and optimized to assure
the best time-space yield. From the plethora of chemical transformations,
gas/liquid reactions have been intensively studied, not only because
they present an efficient atom economy but also because they are environmental-friendly
processes.1 However, the use of a solid
catalyst in these reactions will create a three-phase system, posing
a series of challenges for the reactor designing, such as the contact
between the three phases and the flow boundaries.2 One way to overpass these limitations and improve the interphase
contact is to use a catalytic membrane reactor (CMR), defined as a
device combining a membrane-based separation and a chemical reaction
in one unit.3 The most representative features
of CMRs are their selective removal of a product, retention of the
solid phase (such as a solid catalyst), distribution of a reactant,
and catalyst support.4

In general,
a CMR contains either a polymeric membrane or an inorganic one, but
the latter is preferred because of its thermal stability, chemical
resistance, and mechanical strength.5 Besides
the constituent material, the porosity of the membrane is critical
for its potential catalytic applications, as the permselectivity increases
with the pore size.6 Moreover, the open
pore path and transmembrane pressures are essential in providing an
easier access of the reactants to the active sites.7

In terms of the catalytic active centers, the CMRs
can be divided into two classes: one in which the membrane is the
catalyst in the reaction (e.g., zeolites or dense metallic ones) and
the other where the membrane is inert and the catalyst is incorporated
through different means: physical or chemical vapor deposition, ion
exchange, sol–gel, or impregnation.8 CMRs may include conductive or chemically active materials, which
may operate with external stimuli such as light, electrical current,
chemical activation, enzymatic response, or their combination.9 No matter how the catalyst is loaded, one CMR
can have multiple uses: as an extractor, as a distributor, and/or
as a contactor; in the latter one, the reactants are separately introduced
from each side of the membrane and they meet in the region where the
catalyst is found.10 There are many aspects
that must be taken into consideration when the contactor catalytic
membrane is chosen to perform any reaction. These aspects are catalyst
stability on the membranes, size or shape of catalyst particles, distribution
of the catalyst along the membrane surface, and the stability of the
catalyst under reaction conditions, as well as the ability of the
catalyst to regeneration.11

On this
basis, CMRs have been extensively used in numerous reactions, such
as the production of H2O2 from H2 and O27,12−15 or from H2 and airborne
oxygen under very mild conditions,12 nitrate
ion reduction using H2 generated in situ from formic acid6 and hydrogenation,7,16−20 or oxidation of different organic compounds.18,20−22 The CMR technology presents a huge potential for
different applications as it reduces the investment costs, increases
the energy efficiency, and can be employed for a wide range of conditions
with the aim of increasing the conversion in equilibrium limited reactions.23 Although there is a growing interest in the
membrane reactor technology,24 the attention
is focused more on the catalytic applications and less on the preparative
methods.

In this context, we report a series of novel preparative
methodologies to create palladium- and iron-based corundum membrane
reactors, shifting the CMRs toward a new horizon: hybrid-CMR containing
not one but two different catalytic entities. Palladium and iron were
chosen as the main active metals as Pd is known to be the key catalyst
in hydrogen peroxide synthesis, while Fe offers significant advantages
compared to precious metals, as it is an abundant metal in the
earth crust and its compounds are relatively nontoxic.25 To validate the importance of these new CMRs,
we tested their activity in reactions with potential industrial applications:
peroxidation of phenol (an organic pollutant)26 and in situ epoxidation of trans-chalcone (an example
of an α,β-unsaturated ketone).27

2 Results and Discussion
For a clear
comparison between all the CMRs prepared using different methods, Table 1 presents the active
phase contents.

In terms of active phase distribution, the CMRs prepared
by impregnation displayed the presence of the active phase (Pd or
Fe) throughout the entire section of the hollow fiber (Figure 1a), while those prepared by
sputtering, precipitation, and microemulsion presented a preferential
distribution of the active species on the external surface of the
CMRs (Figure 1b). This
feature can be advantageous to avoid high consumption of reactants
(deposited metallic species and parasitic reactions), favoring the
contact at the external surface of the CMRs. We have already shown28 that Pd is selectively deposited over the external
surface of the membrane.

and sputtering.

2.1 Palladium-Based CMR
2.1.1 Characterization
In order to examine
the Pd and PdCu particles on the CMRs, pieces of reactors were ground
into fine powder and dispersed in ethanol. Figure 2 presents the picture of the original corundum
reactor, the Pd-CMR prepared by impregnation (further used to grow
HT), the PdCu-CMR prepared by microemulsion (PdCu-CMR_m), and Pd-CMR
prepared by sputtering (Pd-CMR_s):

(a) initial corundum CMR, (b) Pd-CMR_i obtained by impregnation, (c)
PdCu-CMR_m obtained by microemulsion, and (d) Pd-CMR_s obtained by
sputtering.

The ground corundum, unmodified, presented bulky,
nonuniform parts, as can be seen in Figure 2a. The Pd-CMR_i obtained by impregnation
using a PdCl2 solution presented Pd nanoparticles (NPs)
with an average size of 16.5 nm (Figure 2b). On the contrary, by employing the reverse
filtration of a microemulsion, we managed to uniformly distribute
PdCu NPs over the entire surface of the CMR, obtaining a smaller NP
average size of ca. 3.8 nm (Figure 2c). Last but not the least, the Pd-CMR_s prepared by
sputtering presented an average size of the NPs of 4.5 nm (Figure 2d).

Crystallinity,
composition, and the distribution of the catalytic phases of the Pd-CMR
were analyzed at different selected areas of the hollow fiber by μ-XRD.
Figure S1 in the Supporting Information presents the diffractogram of the initial tubular hollow fiber (Φ:
1400 nm); as can be observed, the fresh membrane exhibited typical
peaks of α-Al2O3 (JCPDS 00-046-1212).
Using the same procedure, we have analyzed the different Pd-CMRs.
Along with the peaks corresponding to the corundum phase (observed
at the 2θ angles 37.78 and 43.36°), we detected the presence
of a new peak corresponding to the active phase (Pd) for the Pd-CMR_i
(Figure 3b) and PdCu-CMR_m
(Figure 3c). As expected,
no visible peak was detected in the diffractogram of the Pd-CMR_s
(Figure 3a), as the
Pd loading was very low (entry 1, Table 1).

Figure 3 μ-XRD of Pd-based CMRs: (a) Pd-CMR_s;
(b) Pd-CMR_i; and (c) PdCu-CMR_m; * highlights the peak positions
corresponding to the Pd metal.

To prepare the hybrid HT-Pd-CMR, we decided to
use the Pd-CMR prepared by impregnation as it contains the highest
amount of Pd and presented the highest activity in the hydrogen peroxide
synthesis. Our first try was based on immersing the 0.75 wt % Pd-CMR
into a water suspension of HT, defined as Method A. Upon applying
the vacuum, the HT was unevenly distributed over the external surface
of the CMR, and after the drying and calcination processes, the entire
HT was completely lost. This suggests that the HT was not able to
penetrate the pores of the membrane. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractogram
of the CMR did not show the presence of the HT neither in the interior
nor in the exterior of the membrane reactor.

The second method
used (Method B) proved to be more efficient. When the 0.75 wt % Pd-CMR
previously immersed in the Mg and Al salt solutions was submerged
in the 2 M NaOH solution, the HT crystals started to grow in the pores
of the reactor, a phenomenon observed with the naked eye. After in-depth
washing, drying, calcination, and reduction steps, the HT crystals
still remained in the CMR pores as observed from the XRD diffractogram
of a small portion of the CMR (Figure 4).

the characteristic diffraction peaks of the Mg–Al hydrotalcite).

2.1.2 Catalytic Results Using the Pd-CMR
The use of a CMR presents several advantages over the conventional
powder catalyst, the most important one being the improvement of the
three-phase contact. The use of CMR in the direct H2O2 synthesis requires a membrane intrinsically active for catalytic
reactions, for example, dense metal (e.g., Pd), zeolites, or inert
membranes with an incorporated catalytic active phase.29 Over time, the CMRs have become the benchmark
of the direct hydrogen peroxide synthesis because of their great advantages
over the conventional catalysts, which are as follows: (i) the distribution
of the gases avoids the explosion mixture; (ii) the active phase can
be easily regenerated, and (iii) there is a lower deactivation of
the catalysts.8

A variety of procedures
were implied to improve the performance of the CMRs for the direct
synthesis of hydrogen peroxide12−14,30−35 culminating with the work of Osegueda et al. who used a commercial
hollow fiber impregnated with palladium.15,28 This CMR was used for the production of H2O2 in contaminated wastewater effluents, and it was observed that the
hydrogen peroxide obtained in the pores of the CMR is further transformed
into the hydroxyl radicals, which oxidize the undesired organic compounds.

Epoxides are versatile intermediates in the production of complex
molecules used in medicine, perfumery, and so forth. Based on our
experience in using CMR for the production of hydrogen peroxide directly
from hydrogen and oxygen, we have focused our attention in the in
situ epoxidation of trans-chalcone. This reaction
requires the hydroperoxide anions rather than the hydroxyl radicals;
hence, the presence of a base in the reaction medium is of crucial
importance;36,37 thus, creating a hybrid CMR containing
Pd and a basic catalyst, such as a hydrotalcite, seems to be a viable
alternative.

The hybrid CMR prepared by Method B (HT-Pd-CMR_i_b)
was used in the in situ trans-chalcone epoxidation
using a series of solvents both protic and aprotic, as can be shown
in Table 2. The hydrogenated
product (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) was obtained in all of the cases along with the cis-chalcone, but the epoxide was observed only when methanol was used
as the solvent (entries 1 and 2, Table 2). Its formation was confirmed from 1H NMR,
as can be seen in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information. Although the epoxide could not be isolated in
the other tested solvents, the presence of the cis-chalcone is a clear proof that the hybrid CMR is active in the in
situ epoxidation of chalcone, as will be explained further in this
study.

Table 2 Screening of Solvents for the in Situ
Epoxidation of trans-Chalcone Using the Hybrid HT-Pd-CMR_i_b
a Typical procedure: HT-Pd-CMR_i_b
closed to one end and passing 30 N mL/min of H2 to the
other end was introduced in 40 mL of the solvent containing 10 mg
of trans-chalcone; oxygen was directly bubbled in
the mixture. After 6 h, the solvent was evaporated.

b Determined from 1H NMR spectra.

As gas solubility is temperature-dependent, we have
studied the in situ epoxidation of trans-chalcone
using the HT-Pd-CMR_i_b at 0 °C. As expected, in these conditions,
the solubility of oxygen in methanol increased considerably, leading
to a higher production of hydrogen peroxide and a decrease in the
hydrogenation process (entry 2, Table 3). One can deduce that the limiting factor in the epoxidation
reaction is the production of hydrogen peroxide, which also hinders
the undesired reaction. To test this hypothesis, we have rerun the
reaction in MeOH at room temperature but added an additional hydrogen
peroxide (entry 3, Table 3). Not only that the selectivity of the hydrogenated product
decreased, but an increase in both the epoxide and the cis-chalcone was observed.

Table 3 Influence of Temperature on the in
Situ Epoxidation of trans-Chalcone
a Typical procedure: HT-Pd-CMR_i_b
closed to one end and passing 30 N mL/min of H2 to the
other end was introduced in 40 mL of methanol containing 10 mg of trans-chalcone; oxygen was directly bubbled in the mixture.
After 6 h, the solvent was evaporated.

b Determined from 1H NMR spectra.

c Extra H2O2 was
added.

As mentioned above, the hydrogen flow is subjected
through one end of the CMR, while the other end is kept closed, creating
a pressure difference, which forces the hydrogen molecules to exit
through the CMR pores. The pores, containing Pd particles, will activate
the hydrogen, which, in the presence of an oxygen molecule, will form
hydrogen peroxide. Depending on the environment, the newly formed
H2O2 can either decompose to water or transform
into hydroxyl radicals.

In the case of the HT-CMR, the pores
contained both HT and Pd; thus, the formation of the hydrogen peroxide
will subsequently be transformed into the hydroperoxide anion as can
be seen in Scheme 1A. The hydroperoxide anion and a trans-chalcone
molecule (1a) assemble in a complex to form the corresponding
peroxide enolate intermediate (2). This intermediate
is not stable, and will eliminate a hydroxide to give the corresponding
epoxide (3). Isotope-labelled studies of the normal
Weitz–Scheffer oxidation of trans-chalcone
have shown that the enolate (2) can easily undergo rotation,
leading to the formation of cis-chalcone.38 The formation of the epoxide (3) is strongly related to the orientation of the O–O bond in
respect to the π system: the O–O bond has to be antiperiplanar
to enable an overlap with the O–O antibonding orbital. In other
words, because of the steric hindrance and the bulky environment,
the cis-chalcone-enolate is unable to favor the epoxide
production, thus leading to the formation of cis-chalcone
(6).

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the in Situ Epoxidation of trans-Chalcone and Hydrogenation of trans-Chalcone Using HT-Pd-CMR_i_b: (A) Epoxidation Reaction; (B) Hydrogenation
Reaction
On the other hand, the presence of activated
hydrogen on the surface of Pd favors the hydrogenation reaction. The
mechanism of this reaction is not exactly known, but, besides the
hydrogen molecules already bonded, trans-chalcone
has the ability to bind to the surface/pores of the CMR (Scheme 1B); palladium activates
the π bond system of the trans-chalcone double
bond (1b) and the molecule is not removed from the surface
until the transfer of a hydrogen atom is not completed (4).

2.2 Iron-Based CMR
Similar to Pd-CMR,
we have analyzed Fe-doped CMR using different analytical techniques
in order to assess (i) the size and shape of the hematite NPs synthetized
by a w/o microemulsion method [transmission electron microscopy (TEM)];
(ii) surface characteristics of the synthetized CMR and Fe distribution
in different areas of the reactors [environmental scanning electron
microscopy (ESEM)–energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)], and (iii)
the crystallinity and dispersion level of loaded iron species (μ-XRD).
A detailed description of these techniques is provided in the Supporting Information.

2.2.1 Characterization
The hematite NPs
synthetized by the w/o microemulsion method described in Section 4.1.2.3 were
analyzed by TEM (Figure 5). As can be observed, the adopted synthesis methodology led to the
development of monodisperse nanorods 4 nm wide and 11 nm long. The
NP morphology may have differed from the spherical particles reported
by Chin and Yaacob39 and Han et al.40 because of the nature and purity of the surfactant
used (hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB).41

Figure 5 TEM images of the synthetized α-Fe2O3 nanorods by a w/o microemulsion method.

The ESEM micrographs (Figure S4—Supporting Information) of selected areas (external,
inner surface, and cross section) of the original corundum hollow
fiber (Φ: 20 nm) presented dissimilar surface topography, which
can affect the incorporation of active phases. The cross section displayed
a sponge-like symmetric structure. The roughness of the external surface
and cross section of the membrane may benefit the distribution and
incorporation of the active species.

Compared to the original
membrane, the Fe-CMR_i displayed completely different surface features,
as can be seen in Figure 6. The impregnated membrane exhibited oxidic aggregates on
the external surface (Figure 6A) and, to a lesser extent, on the inner wall (Figure 6C); interestingly, the cross
section retained the surface features of the original α-Al2O3 membrane (Figure 6B). In line with this, EDX analysis revealed that the
Fe species were distributed nonuniformly over the tubular hollow fiber,
most of which were incorporated on the external and internal surfaces
of the CMR (Figure S5—Supporting Information). The heterogeneous distribution of the impregnated Fe species may
result from the high calcination temperature, the vacuum drying stage,
and/or the compact structure of corundum.

Figure 6 ESEM images for different
regions of the impregnated membrane (Fe-CMR_i) and calcined at 900
°C (A: external surface, B: cross section, and C: internal surface).

ESEM–EDX analysis was also performed over
Fe-CMR_p and Fe-CMR_m, whose results can be seen in Figures 7 and 8. This analysis corroborated that Fe species were mainly incorporated
on the external surface of the hollow fibers.

Figure 7 ESEM–EDX results
for different membrane regions of Fe-CMR_p prepared by the precipitation
of a Fe complex over the external surface and calcined at 900 °C
(A: external surface and B: cross section).

Figure 8 ESEM–EDX results for different membrane regions
of Fe-CMR_m prepared by reverse filtration of a w/o microemulsion
of hematite nanorods and calcined at 900 °C (A: external surface
and B: cross section).

Similar to the crystallinity of Pd-CMR, Fe-CMR
crystallinity was analyzed at various selected areas of the hollow
fibers. The μ-XRD analysis of the Fe-CMR_m sample only revealed
corundum’s characteristic peaks; neither iron oxide phases
nor mixed oxides were detected (Figure 9). Nevertheless, the same analysis at different regions
of the Fe-CMR_p displayed corundum and incipient hematite peaks (JCPDS
01-071-5088), suggesting the accumulation of oxidic aggregates on
the external surface of the membrane (Figure 10). On the one hand, taking into account
the low Fe content of the Fe-CMR_p, the presence of hematite peaks
might suggest that the preparation methodology did not anchor the
Fe species sufficiently in the alumina membrane. Furthermore, this
poor Fe anchorage was macroscopically visible, and part of the hematite
detached itself from the hollow fiber. On the other hand, the iron
incorporation method used for Fe-CMR_m did favor a high dispersion
level of the active phase (XRD-silent iron phases).

Figure 9 μ-XRD results of
the Fe-CMR_m prepared by reverse filtration of a w/o microemulsion
of hematite nanorods and calcined at 900 °C.

Figure 10 μ-XRD results of the Fe-CMR_p prepared by the precipitation
of a Fe complex and calcined at 900 °C.

These results demonstrate that these preparation
strategies facilitated different Fe distributions on the CMR as well
as surface features that could become useful in other Fe-catalyzed
reactions. Moreover, these synthesis strategies may be employed to
incorporate other metallic species, thus reducing the content required
for active phases, such as precious metals.

2.2.2 Catalytic Results Using the Fe-CMR
Catalytic wet hydrogen peroxide oxidation of phenol involves using
a heterogeneous Fenton-like system (Fe solid catalyst with H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals) for the abatement of
refractory pollutants present in wastewater.43 The phenol oxidation mechanism comprises its decomposition into
aromatic compounds, with two hydroxyl groups substituted in the benzene
ring (hydroquinone, resorcinol, and catechol). The oxidation of these
molecules generates quinone-like compounds (p-benzoquinone
and o-benzoquinone), which can be more toxic than
phenol itself. Afterward, further oxidation gives place to the ring
opening of aromatic molecules to form carboxylic acids, decreasing
the pH of the reaction medium.44,45

In this study,
we have tested the Fe-CMR prepared using the methodologies presented
in this study. The gradual dosage of H2O2 can
be an advantageous strategy to minimize scavenging reactions and enhance
its consumption efficiency.42 According
to the contactor–distributor scheme, the oxidant and the organic
pollutant make contact on the outer side of the membrane. Consequently,
the wet impregnation methodology (Fe-CMR_i) should lead to parasitic
decomposition of H2O2 inside the hollow fiber
because of the direct contact of the oxidant with the active phase
in the absence of an organic substrate. In this sense, the availability
of Fe on the external surface of the membrane is needed, as for Fe-CMR_p
and Fe-CMR_m.

However, our preliminary screening results showed
that Fe-CMR_i was the most active reactor, probably because of its
higher Fe content (entry 5, Table 1). This CMR produced a TOC conversion of ca. 30% (low
mineralization level) and 98% phenol removal. Unfortunately, HPLC
analysis revealed high selectivity toward the formation of highly
toxic dihydroxybenzenes, catechol, and hydroquinone.43 Additionally, we have observed that the reaction medium
pH decreased (around 2) because of the accumulation of carboxylic
acids that promoted iron leaching of 7 mg/L (ICP measurements), which
is likely to have assisted phenol oxidation. On the other hand, the
Fe-CMR_p and Fe-CMR_m reactors did not promote phenol mineralization.

At this point, we can conclude that the Fe-CMRs were better as
distributors than as contactor reactors. As the amount of loaded Fe
was similar to other studies reported in the literature,45,46 we consider that its inability to favor H2O2 decomposition into hydroxyl radicals (Fenton mechanism) might be
related to the inert characteristics of the corundum membrane (absence
of acidic sites) and its low surface area of ∼3 m2/g. These observations were in accordance with the results reported
by Pestunova et al., who studied the peroxidation of 1 g/L of phenol
using Fe-alumina catalysts supported on γ and α-Al2O3 at 90 °C. The authors obtained poor phenol
mineralization (TOC conversion of 26%) for the catalyst supported
on corundum as opposed to the one on γ-Al2O3 (TOC conversion of 56%).47

3 Conclusions
CMRs represent an excellent
solution to the problems faced when carrying out a three-phase catalytic
process. We have successfully managed to develop several methods to
produce new CMRs containing one or more catalytic active sites employing
the following procedures: impregnation of the active phase, sputtering,
reverse filtration of microemulsions, precipitation of a metal complex,
or growing the desired material directly into the pores of the CMR.

For the Pd-based CMRs, we have discovered that using the microemulsion
procedure leads to small and very well-dispersed Pd NPs by contrast
with conventional wet impregnations; therefore, this approach can
be useful to minimize the doped Pd concentration and thus the reactor
cost. Thinking on advanced industrial processes that might require
the presence of several catalysts, we have developed a new method
of growing hydrotalcites in the pores of the Pd-CMR.

In the
same manner, for the Fe-based CMRs, we have observed that in the case
of the impregnation method, the Fe species were distributed nonuniformly
over the hollow fiber. On the contrary, by using a Fe nanorod microemulsion
and the precipitation of a Fe complex (Prussian blue), the Fe species
were incorporated only on the external surface of the CMRs.

To prove the importance of developing these new CMRs, we have studied
their activity in two reactions: in situ epoxidation of trans-chalcone and peroxidation of phenol.

The hybrid Pd-CMR containing
hydrotalcite was able to catalyze two reactions simultaneously: hydrogenation
and epoxidation reaction of the α,β-unsaturated ketone.
Although the epoxide could not be isolated in all the experiments,
the presence of the cis-chalcone demonstrates that
the reaction setup is active. This entire systematic process is the
first one of its kind and illustrates that hydrotalcites incorporated
in CMRs open new routes for developing and designing a new type of
hybrid reactors.

Regarding the abatement of organic pollutants
present in aqueous effluents (peroxidation of phenol), we have observed
that to avoid parasitic reactions with the hydrogen peroxide, the
active Fe species should be deposited on the external side of the
CMR. Nevertheless, the inert nature of the corundum membrane did not
contribute toward the effective mineralization of phenol.

Therefore,
different preparation procedures can be employed to produce CMRs with
unique catalytic activities. Future studies will be carried out to
understand and use the full catalytic potential of these new CMRs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 CMR Preparation
Corundum hollow fiber
membranes of 1400 and 20 nm filtration pore size (Φ) for ultra-
and nanofiltration manufactured by CEPAration were used as the starting
materials for the preparation of different palladium- and iron-based
CMRs. All the hollow fibers are made of corundum (α-Al2O3). The hollow fiber membranes present chemical resistances
to different chemicals in a wide range of pH (1–14). Additionally,
these fibers have high thermal stability, and as a result, they may
be used at temperatures up to 1000 °C. The porosity of the membranes
varied from 10 to 15%. The tubular membranes have an inner diameter
of 2 mm and an outer diameter of 3 mm with a total length of 300 mm.

4.1.1 Palladium-Based CMR (Pd-CMR)
4.1.1.1 Pd-CMR Obtained by the Sputtering Method
The CMR was prepared using a method already reported in the literature;15 briefly, palladium was pulverized from a palladium
target (Hauner metallische werkstoffe, 99.95% purity) in a standard
sputtering chamber and deposited on the external surface of the CMR
of 1400 nm porous size using a K575X sputter coater (Quorum Technologies)
at 30 mA for 60 s of exposition using pure argon as a working gas.
To obtain a homogenous distribution of the noble metal on the CMR
using this method, an assembly was used to rotate with 90 rpm (rotation
per minute) the hollow fiber membrane, while palladium was pulverized
and deposited. A glass plate was placed at the same height with the
membrane as a reference material to determine the thickness (amount)
of the Pd layer by means of X-ray reflectometry using a Bruker-AXS
D8-Discover diffractometer. The thickness of the layer was obtained
by X-ray refractometry.

The CMR was dried at 120 °C for
2 h, calcined at 400 °C overnight, and reduced at 350 °C
under 20 mL/min of H2 for 2 h. The amount of palladium
deposited onto the membrane was obtained by taking into consideration
the thickness of the Pd layer on the glass plate, the effective membrane
area exposed to the palladium beam, and the rotation velocity.

This CMR was denoted as Pd-CMR_s. It is worth mentioning that all
the Pd_CMRs have the same appearance after reduction, thus Figure 11 presents an example
of a CMR before (a) and after the reduction step (b).

4.1.1.2 CMR with PdCu NPs Alloy Loaded by Inverse
Impregnation
The microemulsion containing the PdCu precursor
was synthesized following a variation of the procedure described in
the literature.48,49 The NPs were obtained by mixing
two microemulsions of water in oil. Both microemulsions contained
17.78% w/w of CTAB as a surfactant (purity ≥ 96%, Fluka Analytical),
22.22% w/w of n-butanol as a cosurfactant (purity
99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), 40% w/w of iso-octane (Pareac),
and 20% w/w of an aqueous solution of the metal precursors (PdCu aqueous
solution) or reducing agent (0.5 M of hydrazine solution). The PdCu
aqueous solution was a mixture of individual precursor solutions to
obtain a metal proportion of 80% of Pd and 20% of Cu. The solution
of 0.01 M Pd(NH3)4Cl2 was prepared
by dissolving PdCl2 (Johnson Matthey, 59.83% metal content)
in 0.5 N hydrochloric acid; the solution was adjusted to pH 9 using
ammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich). Solution (0.01 M) of [Cu(NH3)4]Cl2 was obtained using the similar
procedure starting with CuCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, assay 90).
The solution of 0.5 M H4N2 was obtained by dissolving
H4N2OH (hydrazine monohydrate with approximately
64% of hydrazine, Sigma-Aldrich) in Milli-Q water. The two microemulsions
were vigorously stirred at ambient temperature. In order to produce
the palladium–copper NPs, both microemulsions were mixed and
rapidly stirred at 450 rpm. To eliminate the excess surfactant, the
solution was washed with ethanol and centrifuged. The PdCu NP deposition
onto the external surface of the chosen membrane was performed by
a simple filtration procedure from the outside to the inside of the
membrane. The PdCu NPs suspended in ethanol were placed in a 100 mL
test tube, and the solution was continuously stirred. The hollow fiber
membrane of 1400 nm pore size was placed in the test tube. One end
of the CMR was tightly closed, and the other end was connected to
vacuum. A cold trap was coupled to the vacuum line to recover the
permeated ethanol. The level of liquid in the tube was maintained
by continuously adding fresh ethanol. During the filtration, the PdCu
NPs were retained on the external membrane surface in a homogeneous
manner because of the continuous stirring process. In order to measure
the amount of palladium loaded onto the membrane, a mass balance was
realized from measurements by ICP. For this analysis, samples from
the different solutions were collected: the initial and final feed
solution from the test tube containing the suspended PdCu NPs and
the permeate solution retained in the cold trap.

The CMR was
dried in a special vessel under vacuum for 30 min. Furthermore, the
CMR was dried at 120 °C for 2 h, calcined at 550 °C for
6 h, and reduced under a hydrogen flow (20 mL/min) at 350 °C
for 3 h.

The resulting catalytic reactor was denoted as PdCu-CMR_m.

4.1.1.3 Pd-CMR and Mg–Al Hydrotalcite by
the Impregnation Method
The palladium impregnation technique
was already explained elsewhere.15,18 The impregnation
of the CMR with Pd was done as follows: a known amount of the precursor
salt solution of palladium (PdCl2 from Johnson Matthey,
59.83% noble metal) was added into Milli-Q water under stirring, over
which concentrated hydrochloric acid (purity grade of 37%, Sigma-Aldrich)
was added dropwise until the salt was completely dissolved. Finally,
the concentration was adjusted with Milli-Q water in order to achieve
approximately 1% of weight of Pd per weight of the membrane. The palladium
precursor solution was impregnated into the membrane of 1400 nm of
pore size. Once the impregnation was complete, the CMR was dried in
a special vessel under vacuum for 30 min. In this step, the CMR was
rotated along the horizontal axis in order to avoid preferential deposition
of the salts onto the ceramic support. Furthermore, the CMR was dried
at 120 °C for 5 h, calcined at 450 °C overnight, and reduced
under 20 mL/min of hydrogen at 350 °C for 3 h. The amount of
palladium deposited was calculated by the weight difference between
the original and the modified membrane. The final CMR was divided
into two equal parts of 15 cm. For the preparation of the hybrid reactors,
two procedures were used:

Method A: Mg–Al HT was prepared
separately and then loaded on the CMR. The HT containing Mg–Al
ratio 2:1 was prepared by the coprecipitation method at room temperature
and pH = 10. The appropriate amounts of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 110 mL of Milli-Q water
and added dropwise into a vessel containing 150 mL of Milli-Q water.
The pH was kept constant using 2 M NaOH solution. The suspension was
stirred overnight at room temperature. The obtained solid was filtered
and washed several times with Milli-Q water and dried under vacuum.
The Pd-CMR (prepared by impregnation, having a length of 15 cm and
a nominal pore size of 1400 nm) with one end closed was attached to
a vacuum system and introduced into a recipient containing Mg–Al
HT suspended in solution (containing 2 wt % HT with respect to the
CMR). The entire system was continuously stirred. Under vacuum, the
HT was retained on the external surface of the CMR. This process was
repeated three times, and then the CMR was washed with MilliQ water
several times, dried, and calcined at 450 °C in air overnight.
Finally, the hybrid CMR was reduced under 15 mL/min of H2 for 3 h at room temperature. The CMR was denoted as HT-Pd-CMR_i_a.

Method B: The Pd-CMR with both ends closed was introduced first
into a solution containing Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and left there for 3 min, then introduced into a solution
of Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and left there
for 3 min. This process was repeated three times to assure a 2 wt
% HT deposited on the CMR (prepared by impregnation, having a length
of 15 cm and a nominal pore size of 1400 nm), and afterward, without
washing, the CMR was introduced into a 2 M NaOH solution and left
there for 10 min. After this, the CMR was washed with MilliQ water
overnight, dried, and calcined at 450 °C in air overnight. Finally,
the hybrid CMR was reduced for 2 h at room temperature under H2 flow. The CMR was denoted as HT-Pd-CMR_i_b.

4.1.2 Iron-Based CMR (Fe-CMR)
4.1.2.1 Iron-Based CMR by the Impregnation Method
The tubular hollow fiber (Φ (nominal pore size): 20 nm; length:
75 mm) was impregnated with a Fe precursor solution using an incipient
wetness technique. The membrane was submerged in a highly concentrated
solution of ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O
Sigma-Aldrich, 97%). The precursor solution was forced to penetrate
the entire surface of the membrane repeatedly. Thereafter, the impregnated
membrane was dried in several stages so as to promote a homogeneous
distribution of the active phase. First, the excess liquid was removed
by drying the CMR under vacuum for 15 min. Next, the hollow fiber
was dried overnight at room temperature before being heated in an
oven at 110 °C for 24 h (static air atmosphere). Finally, the
impregnated membrane was calcined in a muffle furnace at 900 °C
for 4 h (10 °C/min, static air atmosphere). This CMR, whose visual
aspect is depicted in Figure 12a, was given the name Fe-CMR_i. Its final Fe content was determined
by the weight difference between the fresh membrane and the calcined
CMR.

Figure 12 Fe-based CMR prepared by the (a) impregnation method, (b) precipitation
of a Fe complex, and (c) reverse filtration of a w/o microemulsion
containing hematite NPs.

4.1.2.2 Precipitation of a Fe Complex on the External
Surface of the Membrane
To ensure that the Fe species were
deposited on the external surface of the tubular hollow fiber, a Fe
complex (Prussian blue Fe3[Fe(CN)6]2) was precipitated on the external part of the membrane by separating
the Fe precursor salts from the reducing agent (hydrogen peroxide).
For this, we used a modified version of the method reported by Doumic
et al.50 Preparation of the Fe complex
involved exposing the membrane’s exterior to a stirred aqueous
solution of ferric chloride (0.1 M) and potassium ferricyanide K3[Fe(CN)6] (0.1 M, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99%)
for 10 min; at the same time, hydrogen peroxide (30 wt %) was continuously
supplied from inside the membrane at a flow rate of 2 mL/h. The proper
adjustment of the contact time and the flow of H2O2 were key to achieving a good adhesion of the complex on the
membrane’s outer surface. For homogeneous distribution of the
active phase, the membrane (Φ: 20 nm; length: 75 mm) was positioned
vertically inside a 100 mL test tube and operated as a semicontinuous
contactor–distributor system. This scheme was based on a communicating
vessel arrangement between the reservoir containing the H2O2 feeding solution and the test tube with the Fe precursor’s
solution. This configuration kept the pressure balanced, thus keeping
constant the permeate flow of the reducing agent. The hydrogen peroxide
was supplied by means of a peristaltic pump, forcing its recirculation
into the feeding tank, favoring the elimination of bubbles accumulated
in the inner zone of the membrane. The experimental setup was depicted
in Figure S6.

Afterward, the membranes
were dried and calcined at 900 °C, as explained above (see Section 4.1.2.1). This
CMR was named Fe-CMR_p, and Figure 12b displays its visual appearance.

4.1.2.3 CMR with α-Fe2O3 Nanorods Loaded by Reverse Filtration of a w/o Microemulsion
Another strategy was to prepare a microemulsion of hematite NPs and
incorporate them into the hollow fiber by an inverse filtration procedure.
Hematite NPs were synthesized by the water-in-oil microemulsion method
adapting different experimental protocols already reported in the
literature.30,31 The iron oxide NPs were obtained
by mixing two w/o microemulsions. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
(Fluka, ≥ 96%), n-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich,
99.8%), n-octane (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99%), ferric
chloride (Sigma-Aldrich), sodium hydroxide, and ultrapure water (Milli-Q
water, Millipore) were used as the surfactant, cosurfactant, oil phase,
Fe precursor, precipitant agent, and aqueous phase, respectively.
Both microemulsions were prepared by adjusting the surfactant, cosurfactant,
and oil phase at a molar ratio of 1:3.9:9. The microemulsion containing
the Fe species aqueous solution was a mixture of ferric chloride (0.4
M) and trace amounts of ferrous chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) by using
molar ratios of Fe(II)/Fe(III) = 0.08 and water/surfactant = 10.9.
Similarly, a second microemulsion containing aqueous solution of NaOH
(0.25 M) was prepared. The two microemulsions were stirred at room
temperature until they became transparent. Afterward, the NaOH microemulsion
was added dropwise to the stirred microemulsion containing the Fe
species using a volumetric ratio of 1:1. After mixing, the solution
turned reddish–brown, indicating the formation of the precipitate.
The final microemulsion was heated at 105 °C and refluxed for
24 h under vigorous stirring.

These NPs were incorporated into
the external surface of the membrane (Φ: 20 nm; length: 75 mm)
by using an analogous reverse filtration procedure as reported in Section 4.1.1.2. Likewise,
the final Fe content deposited on the membrane was determined using
ICP, as described earlier in Section 4.1.1.2. The membranes were dried and calcined
at 900 °C (see Section 4.1.2.1). The CMR was labeled as Fe-CMR_m,
and Figure 12c shows
its visual aspect.

4.2 Catalytic Testing
4.2.1 In Situ Epoxidation of trans-Chalcone
One end of the CMR was tightly closed, and to
the other end, a flow of H2 was supplied by means of a
mass flow controller (30 mL/min). The CMR was immersed in a reaction
vessel, which contained 40 mL of solvent and 10 mg of trans-chalcone. In order to test the influence of solvents upon the outcome
of the reaction, different polar aprotic, polar protic, and nonpolar
solvents were used: water, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile propanol,
dimethyl sulfoxide, and heptane. The reaction was performed at room
temperature and normal pressure, and after 6 h, the solvent was removed
by vacuum distillation and the products were analyzed by 1H NMR. Selectivity was computed from 1H NMR spectra.

4.2.2 Peroxidation of Phenol
The operating
conditions consisted of [phenol]0 = 5 g/L, stoichiometric
dosage of hydrogen peroxide ([H2O2]0 = 0.75 mol/L), T = 70 °C and atmospheric pressure,
reaction time = 4 h, and pH0 = 3. Figure S6 in the Supporting Information shows the semicontinuous
reaction system implemented; this scheme consisted in an experimental
setup similar to that applied in the preparation of Fe-CMR_p (see Section 4.1.2.2). In
this case, the oxidant agent (hydrogen peroxide) was gradually supplied
at a rate of 2 mL/h (30 wt %) from the inner side and put in contact
with the phenolic solution at the external surface of the CMR. Catalytic
performance was monitored in terms of phenol concentration (HPLC)
and TOC removal. Liquid samples were taken at different time intervals
and analyzed, as reported elsewhere.28,46
