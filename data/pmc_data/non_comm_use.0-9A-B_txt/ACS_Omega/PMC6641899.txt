High-accuracy
quantum chemical calculations were carried out to
study the mechanisms and catalytic abilities of various mixed silicon
species Si2M with M = H, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag toward the
first step of methanol activation reaction. Standard heats of formation
of these small triatomic Si clusters were determined. Potential-energy
profiles were constructed using the coupled-cluster theory with extrapolation
to complete basis set CCSD(T)/CBS, and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ-PP for
Si2Cu and Si2Ag. The most stable complexes generated
by the interaction of methanol with the mixed clusters Si2M possess low-spin states and mainly stem from an M–O connection
in preference to Si–O interaction, except for the Si2H case. In two competitive pathways including O–H and C–H
bond breakings, the cleavage of the O–H bond in the presence
of all clusters studied becomes predominant. Of the mixed clusters
Si2M considered, the dissociation pathways of both O–H
and C–H bonds with Si2Li turns out to have the lowest
energy barriers. The most remarkable finding is the absence of the
overall energy barrier for the O–H cleavage with the assistance
of Si2Li. The breaking of O–H and C–H bonds
with the assistance of Si2H, Si2Li, and Si2Na is kinetically preferred with respect to the Si2Cu and Si2Ag cases, apart from the case of Si2Na for O–H cleavage. In comparison with other transition-metal
clusters with the same size, such as Cu3, Pt3, and PtAu2, the energy barriers for the O–H bond
activation in the presence of small Si species, especially Si2H and Si2Li, are found to be lower. Consequently,
these small mixed silicon clusters can be regarded as promising alternatives
for the expensive metal-based catalysts currently used for methanol
activation particularly and other dehydrogenation processes of organic
compounds. The present study also suggests a further extensive search
for other doped silicon clusters as efficient and more realistic gas-phase
catalysts for important dehydrogenation processes in such a way that
they can be experimentally prepared and implemented.

1 Introduction
Methanol
(CH3OH), the simplest alcohol, has attracted
continuous interest in part due to its numerous applications in various
fields. Indeed, pure methanol is employed as a crucial material in
chemical synthesis. Its derivatives are used in large quantities for
building up a large number of compounds, in which dyestuffs, resins,
drugs, and perfumes, to name a few, are known as important synthetic
materials.1 Large amounts of methanol are
industrially converted to dimethylaniline for making dyestuffs and
reduced to formaldehyde for synthetic resins. Moreover, methanol is
used in automotive antifreezes, in rocket fuels, and as a general
solvent thanks to its polarity within a large range of temperature
(−98 to 65 °C). It is also considered as a high-octane,
clean-burning fuel that is a potentially essential substitute for
gasoline in automotive vehicles.2 Additionally,
it plays a role as hydrogen carrier and is thus transformed to pure
hydrogen via steam reforming, which is an important industrial process.3−6 More importantly, methanol is attractive as a CO2 hydrogenation
product because it can directly be used as a drop-in liquid fuel for
direct methanol fuel cells and internal combustion engines.7 Methanol is hence largely viewed as a prospective
candidate for the future generation of renewable green fuels.8

An indispensable step in virtually all
applications indicated above
pertaining methanol is to activate its strong O–H (bond energy,
∼105 kcal/mol) and C–H (bond energy, ∼96 kcal/mol)
bonds. Nonetheless, cleavage of these strong organic bonds is still
a major challenge for any efficient chemical process and thereby continues
to receive widespread attention of both academic and industrial experts
alike. In fact, experimental and theoretical studies on the selective
breaking of both O–H and C–H bonds of methanol have
been carried out with the assistance of a wide range of compounds,
such as bioinspired metal compounds,9 transition-metal
(TM) surfaces,10−15 metal oxides,16−18 metal clusters,19−33 and so forth.

Despite many previous investigations on methanol
activation conducted
on different materials, data on the catalytic abilities of pure and
doped silicon clusters for this process are quite limited. Recently,
we have studied the methanol dissociation pathways in the presence
of small pure silicon clusters (Si3, Si4) and
earth-alkali mixed silicon clusters (Si2X, Si3X with X = Be, Mg, and Ca).34 The most
interesting result found in the latter study is that the energy barriers
for the O–H bond rupture on the Si3, Si2Ca, and Si3Ca clusters appear to be much lower than all
values reported in previous studies. This reveals that the silicon
clusters and their doped derivatives can emerge as good agents for
methanol activation reactions. In view of the promising activities
of Si clusters, we set out to carry on further investigating the different
effects of small mixed silicon clusters. In the present study, we
consider the triatomic Si2M with various elements M toward
the initial bond breaking of methanol, using high-accuracy quantum
chemical methods. The chosen elements M include hydrogen, alkali metal
(Li, Na), and coinage metals (Cu, Ag), which all possess an ns1 valence electron. It is well established that alkali metal
and coinage metal compounds could serve as electronic promoters or
textural for catalysts in numerous catalytic processes.14,15,23,26,35−40 For instance, attachment of alkali metals to a cobalt–cerium
composite oxide catalyst induces a substantial rise in catalytic activity
for the decomposition of N2O.36 Copper-based catalysts were also proven to show good activities
for methanol and ethanol dehydrogenation.40−43 Methanol conversion in the presence
of Cu3 clusters was also studied.22 In this context, a comparative study on the transformation of methanol
in the presence of different small mixed silicon clusters, including
Si2H, Si2Li, Si2Na, Si2Cu, and Si2Ag, is performed. Through this study, we aim
to provide a detailed mechanism for the methanol activation with the
help of various triatomic silicon clusters and thereby suggest subsequent
extensive searches for doped silicon clusters as good catalysts for
activating methanol and other hydrogenated organic compounds.

2 Results and Discussion
This part is divided into three
different sections. The first one
focuses on analysis of the structural characteristics and relative
energies of the most stable clusters and complexes obtained upon interaction
of methanol with the mixed silicon clusters studied. The next section
is devoted to methanol activation reactions in the presence of these
clusters. In the last section, we make a comparison between the actions
of the clusters studied in the present work and other clusters having
the same size from the literature.

2.1 Geometries, Electronic
Structures, and Thermochemical
Parameters of the Triatomic Si2M Clusters with M = H, Li,
Na, Cu, and Ag
2.1.1 Geometries and Electronic
Structures of
Si2M
The ground states of mixed clusters Si2X are initially determined to characterize the substrates
for adsorption of the methanol molecule. Our calculations show that
replacement of a Si atom in the trimer Si3 by an M atom
with M = H, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag induces a large change in the electronic
state and the low–high-spin energy gaps of the resulting mixed
clusters. Let us mention that in the pure Si3 trimer, its
singlet (1A1, C2v) and triplet (3A2′, D3h) states were found to be
energetically degenerate.44

Upon
replacement of Si by M, the Si2M species has an open-shell
state, and the low–high-spin gap is thus that between both
lowest-lying doublet and quartet states. The low-spin doublet states
now become much more stable than the corresponding high-spin quartet
states in all clusters considered. The most stable triatomic clusters
Si2M have an isosceles triangle structure (C2v), in which the M atom connects with
two Si atoms. Their doublet–quartet energy differences are
computed to be 25, 36, 38, 26, and 32 kcal/mol for Si2H,
Si2Li, Si2Na, Si2Cu, and Si2Ag, respectively.

2.1.2 Thermochemical Parameters
of Si2M
In light of the fact that basic thermochemical
parameters
of these clusters are not experimentally discovered yet, let us first
evaluate their total atomization energies (TAEs) and heats of formation.
The TAE of each cluster is calculated using CCSD(T) and the composite
G4 (in some cases) energies. The G4 is known as a good method in determining
heats of formation with absolute deviation of only ±1 kcal/mol.45 By combining our computed TAE values from either
CCSD(T) or the G4 computations, with the known experimental heats
of formation at 0 and 298 K for the elements Si and M, the heats of
formation ΔHf,0 and ΔHf,298 for the clusters studied (Si2M) are derived. In this work, the ΔHf,0 values are used to be 107.2, 51.6, 37.7, 25.8, 80.4, and 67.8 kcal/mol
for Si, H, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag, respectively.46,47 To check the reliability of both CCSD(T) and G4 results, we first
calculate the TAE, ΔHf,0, and ΔHf,298 values of pure Si2 and Si3 clusters using both methods mentioned above and compare them
with available experimental values.

All calculated results for
the triatomic clusters are given in Table 1. Overall, both CCSD(T) and G4 results are
in good agreement with the experimental data. Although the TAE and
the ΔHf,298 values of pure silicon
clusters are overestimated in terms of the experimental results, except
for the TAE value of Si2, they are close to the upper error
margin (Table 1). For
the Si2H, Si2Li, and Si2Na, the TAE
values obtained by the CCSD(T) approach are somewhat smaller than
those obtained by the G4 method, whereas the results for ΔHf,0 and ΔHf,298 values are reversed. The maximum difference between two approaches
is computed to be 2.3 kcal/mol. In the case of Si2Cu and
Si2Ag, only CCSD(T) TAE, ΔHf,0, and ΔHf,298 are reported.
We would expect an error margin of <2.5 kcal/mol for the computed
values.

2.2 Geometries and Electronic Structures of the
Lowest-Lying Si2M–CH3OH Complexes with
M = H, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag
From the lowest-lying isomers of
triatomic clusters Si2M, the interaction between the clusters
and methanol are explored in both doublet and quartet states. Our
results find a strong similarity in low- and high-spin energy differences
of all Si2M with and without methanol. The Si2M–CH3OH doublet complexes are more stable than
the high-spin quartet states. This behavior is completely analogous
to that of Si2Y cases with Y = Be, Mg, and Ca reported
in our recent study, in which the singlet complexes are more favored
than the corresponding triplets.34 As a
result, only low-spin (doublet) complexes between Si2M
and CH3OH are discussed in this context. Figure 1 displays the shape of most
stable isomers of all complexes and their corresponding CCSD(T) relative
energies.

Figure 1 Optimized geometries and CCSD(T)/(CBS) + ZPE relative energies
(ΔE, kcal/mol) of the lower-lying complexes
obtained through interaction between CH3OH and the mixed
silicon Si2X clusters (Si2X–CH3OH). The dark blue, white, red, gray, pink, purple, copper orange,
and silver blue balls denote Si, H, O, C, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag atoms,
respectively.

2.2.1 Complexes
with Si2H
Six stable complexes are observed when
Si2H interacts
with CH3OH. Geometries and relative energies of these complexes
are displayed in Figure 1. As for a convention, the complex cp.M.a represents
the most stable complex formed between Si2M and methanol.
The O atom in methanol obviously prefers to attach to a Si atom than
the H atom in Si2H in all complexes obtained. This can
be understood by the difference in net charges of both Si and H atoms
in Si2H. In other words, the net charges of two Si atoms
are positive when the H atom is negatively charged (cf. Table S1 of the Supporting Information). Possessing a large electronegativity, the O atom
inevitably links to one of the Si atoms in Si2H. Of the
complexes obtained, the out-of-the plane attachment of O to the Si
atom is more favored than the other approaches and tends to yield
the most stable complexes, namely, cp.H.a and cp.H.b, with the relative energy difference of only 1 kcal/mol. The remaining
planar complexes, including cp.H.c, cp.H.d, cp.H.e, and cp.H.f, turn out to be less
stable (cf. Figure 1).

2.2.2 Complexes with Group IA Alkali Metal (Si2Li and Si2Na)
Unlike the case of Si2H, the O atom of methanol now preferentially connects with
the alkali metal atom in Si2Li and Si2Na. The
main reason for this is the high positive net charges of Li and Na.
The Si atom also possesses a negative net charge in the cluster (cf. Table S1 of the Supporting Information). As a result, only complexes formed via M–O
interaction with M = Li, Na are found in these systems (Figure 1). The reason for such a trend
can be elucidated as follows. The M–O interaction in these
Si2M–CH3OH complexes can be seen as an
ionic bond. Known as the elements having electropositivity and smallest
atomic radius in the Periodic Table, the alkali metals form a bond
with oxygen (M–O), which is much stronger than the more covalent
Si–O bond. With the smaller atomic radius than the Na atom,
only one stable complex named cp.Li.a is located for
Si2Li. Meanwhile, three different complexes, including cp.Na.a, cp.Na.b, and cp.Na.c, given
in Figure 1 are generated
through the Na–O interplay. Of these forms, the cp.Na.a formed by out-of-the-plane adsorption of methanol on Si2Na again emerges to be the most stable complex. The planar Na–O
interaction complexes, namely, cp.Na.b and cp.Na.c, are less favored, lying 2 and 3 kcal/mol above cp.Na.a.

2.2.3 Complexes with Group IB Coinage Metals (Si2Cu and Si2Ag)
Complexes attained in the
Si2Cu and Si2Ag systems are formed by two different
ways, as the result of the very small difference in electronegativity
between the Cu and Ag coinage metals and Si atom. Accordingly, in
addition to the complexes cp.Cu.a and cp.Ag.a generated through interaction of the O atom with the coinage metals,
the others are formed via Si–O interaction. The M–O
distance is found to be smaller than that of Si–O bond in both
systems and consequently the most stable complex again prefers an
M–O bond over the Si–O connectivity. Particularly, in
the Si2Cu case, cp.Cu.b and cp.Cu.c with a Si–O bond is much less favored, being 20 and 21 kcal/mol
above cp.Cu.a.

The relative-energy values of the
complexes located for Si2Ag are smaller than those of Si2Cu. Specifically, the cp.Ag.b and cp.Ag.c complexes are 12 and 13 kcal/mol higher in energy than the corresponding
most stable complex cp.Ag.a (cf. Figure 1).

In general, adsorption of methanol
on the mixed Si2M
with M = H, Li, N, Cu, and Ag does not induce a substantial change
in the low- and high-spin energy difference of these clusters, and
the most stable complexes exhibit the low-spin (doublet) state. In
most cases, the most stable complexes cp.X.a stem from
an X–O connectivity in preference to the Si–O bond,
except for the case of Si2H.

2.3 Methanol
Activation by the Triatomic Si2M with M = H, Li, Na, Cu,
and Ag
2.3.1 O–H Bond Dissociation in Methanol
2.3.1.1 In the Presence of Si2H
Figure 2 plots schematic
potential-energy profiles associated with possible O–H bond
cleavage pathways beginning from four different stable complexes Si2H–CH3OH, including cp.H.b, cp.H.c, cp.H.d, and cp.H.f (Figure 1). These complexes
have relatively low interaction energies of −6, −5,
−5, and −1 kcal/mol, respectively, similar to the singlet
Si3 case.34 Of the five O–H
bond detachment pathways found, the pathways of cp.H.c and cp.H.d via ts-H.c,2 and ts-H.d,4 emerge to have the lowest energy barriers of 7 and 11 kcal/mol,
respectively, leading to products 2 and 4 having the same relative energies of −49 kcal/mol. Such lower
energy barriers of two TSs can be explained by the formation of four-membered
ring structures, compared to the less stable strained three-membered
ring geometries of the other TSs (cf. Figure 2).

Figure 2 Schematic potential-energy profiles demonstrating
the O–H
activation reaction of methanol in the presence of Si2H.
Relative energies in kcal/mol were gained from CCSD(T)/CBS + ZPE computations.

The barrier heights found for
three remaining O–H bond dissociation
pathways starting from cp.H.b, cp.H.c, and cp.H.f via three TSs, including ts-H.b,1, ts-H.c,3, and ts-H.f,5, are in close proximity
to each other, with the energy barriers of 23, 24, and 21 kcal/mol,
respectively. The formation of corresponding products, namely, 1, 3, and 5, is substantially an
exothermic processes with released energies of −49, −51,
and −50.0 kcal/mol, respectively.

2.3.1.2 In
the Presence of Si2Li and
Si2Na
As expected from the net atomic charges,
CH3OH is more strongly bound to Si2Li and Si2Na than Si2H to generate three complexes, including cp.Li.a, cp.Na.a, and cp.H.c, with
interaction energies of −19, −14, and −11 kcal/mol,
respectively. The decrease in interaction energies in going from Li
to Na is in line with the M–O bond lengths of 1.88, 2.26, and
2.27 Å in the above-mentioned complexes, respectively. Obviously,
substitution of the hydrogen atom in the Si2H by an alkali
metal significantly facilitates interaction between the clusters and
methanol.

Calculated energy profiles and the corresponding TS
structures for O–H bond scission of methanol with the assistance
of Si2Li and Si2Na are given in Figure 3a,b, respectively. Overall,
all of the O–H bond cleavages mediated by Si2Li
and Si2Na clusters are energetically favored, with an exothermic
reaction energy of at least −34 kcal/mol, analogous to the
Si2H case. Two different TSs starting from the complex cp.Li.a, namely, ts-Li.a,6 and ts-Li.a,7, are found for Si2Li, with the respective energy barriers
of 21 and 15 kcal/mol. A noteworthy fact here is that the latter ts-Li.a,7 is located beneath the zero-energy level compared
to the separated reactants (Figure 3a). As a result, the corresponding product 7 can readily be created from ts-Li.a,7 with an energy
release of −39 kcal/mol. The generation of product 6 from the former ts-Li.a,6 also has a substantial exothermicity
of −46 kcal/mol.

Figure 3 Schematic potential-energy profiles showing
the O–H dissociation
reaction of methanol with the assistance of Si2Li (a) and
Si2Na (b) clusters. Relative energies in kcal/mol were
obtained from CCSD(T)/CBS + ZPE computations.

The reaction-energy profiles of the O–H bond scission
of
methanol in the presence of Si2Na are characterized by
higher energy barriers than the Si2Li case via three different
TSs, including ts-Na.a,8, ts-Na.a,9, and ts-Na.c,8 (Figure 3b). Particularly, from cp.Na.a, the O–H
bond dissociation can occur via two distinctive TSs to produce products 8 and 9. The generation of the former requires
a 21 kcal/mol barrier via ts-Na.a,8 and an energy release
of −42 kcal/mol. Meanwhile, the formation of the latter needs
to overcome a barrier of 25 kcal/mol via ts-Na.a,9 with
a reaction energy of −34 kcal/mol. Although the barriers are
quite high, the O–H bond breaking reactions with the help of
Si2Na still take an advantage over the isolated reactants,
thanks to a strong interplay between Si2Na and CH3OH. Accordingly, the overall energy barrier, defined by the relative
energy of the least-stable transition structure on a particular reaction
pathway in regard to the total energy of the isolated one, is now
found to be only 7 and 11 kcal/mol. Additionally, product 8 can be formed via ts-Na.c,8 from the complex cp.Na.b. This process is characterized by a barrier of 26
kcal/mol. Clearly, the channel via ts-Na.a,8 is the most
favorable O–H cleavage pathway using Si2Na. The
higher barrier heights of these TSs compared to those of Si2Li are most likely due to the increase in strength of M–O
interaction from Li to Na.

2.3.1.3 In
the Presence of Si2Cu and
Si2Ag
As depicted in Figure 4, the potential-energy profiles found for
O–H bond cleavage pathways of methanol driven by Si2Cu and Si2Ag are somewhat similar. Specifically, pathways
starting from the M–O interaction complex cp.M.a (M = Cu, Ag) are characterized by higher energy barriers than the
Si–O interaction complexes, such as cp.M.b and cp.M.c. Furthermore, the rupture of the O–H bond through
the former is endothermic, whereas it becomes exothermic in these
latter cases.

Figure 4 Schematic potential-energy profiles showing the O–H
dissociation
reaction of methanol with the assistance of the Si2Cu (a)
and Si2Ag (b) clusters. Relative energies in kcal/mol were
obtained from CCSD(T)/AVTZ-PP + ZPE computations.

In particular, an O–H bond breaking reaction from cp.Cu.a can occur via two different TSs, namely, ts-Cu.a,10 and ts-Cu.a,11. The O–H bond breaking via ts-Cu.a,11 (with a four-membered ring structure) involves
a smaller energy barrier of 14 kcal/mol than that via ts-Cu.a,10 (49 kcal/mol via a three-membered ring TS). Although the energy
barriers found in the case are quite high (35 and 49 kcal/mol), the
overall energy barriers are now only 9 and 23 kcal/mol, thanks to
the strong interaction energy of −26 kcal/mol in the formation
of cp.Cu.a via interaction between Si2Cu and
methanol (Figure 4a).
The other O–H bond breaking pathways in the presence of Si2Cu come from the Si–O interaction complexes. While
the O–H bond dissociation pathway starting from cp.Cu.c yielding product 13 via ts-Cu.c,13 happens
in a much easier way, involving a small barrier of ∼11 kcal/mol,
the pathway from cp.Cu.b via ts-Cu.b,12 to
form product 12 needs a higher energy barrier of 23 kcal/mol
(cf. Figure 4a). The
higher barrier associated with ts-Cu.b,12 is due to the
strain imparted by the presence of a strained three-membered ring,
compared to the less strained four-membered ring in ts-Cu.c,13. Formation of products 12 and 13 has a
substantial exothermicity of −48 and −38 kcal/mol, respectively.

A similar trend is also observed in the Si2Ag-assisted
O–H bond cleavage pathways, as demonstrated in Figure 4b. Two highest energy barriers
of 41 and 65 kcal/mol via two TSs ts-Ag.a,14 and ts-Ag.a,15 come from the Ag–O interaction complex cp.Ag.a. However, the O–H dissociation pathways of
this complex still have an advantage over the separate reactants due
to a relatively strong interaction between Si2Ag and methanol
to form cp.Ag.a, with a complexation energy of −19
kcal/mol. The overall barriers for these pathways of cp.Ag.a are now reduced to 22 and 46 kcal/mol. Two remaining pathways characterized
by lower barrier heights emanate from the Ag–O interaction
complexes, namely, cp.Ag.b and cp.Ag.c.
Of the latter, the O–H bond breaking channel of cp.Ag.b via TS ts-Ag.b,16 forming product 16 turns
out to have the lowest barrier of only 11 kcal/mol. The other pathway
of cp.Ag.c via TS ts-Ag.c,15 yielding the
product 15 happens in a much more difficult way involving
a barrier of 23 kcal/mol.

2.3.2 C–H
Bond Cleavage of Methanol
2.3.2.1 With the Assistance
of Si2H
Figure 5 shows the
C–H bond breaking pathways in the presence of Si2H. In contrast to the O–H dissociation case, in which all
pathways are exothermic, only three C–H dissociation pathways
coming from three complexes, cp.H,a, cp.H.e, and cp.H.f, to yield products 19 are
found to be exothermic. However, the energy barriers found in these
pathways are higher than those of the remaining ones that are endothermic
(cf. Figure 5). The
cleavage of C–H bond via ts-H.b,20 with the lowest
energy barrier of 28 kcal/mol is thus the most favorable channel.
In comparison with O–H breaking pathways with the help of Si2H, the C–H bond rupture channels are obviously not
favorable. An important reason for such a difference is that the latter
has the benefit of a stabilization effect through hydrogen bonds.

Figure 5 Schematic
potential-energy profiles demonstrating the C–H
bond breaking reaction of methanol with the assistance of Si2H. Relative energies in kcal/mol were attained from CCSD(T)/CBS +
ZPE computations.

2.3.2.2 With
the Assistance of Si2Li
and Si2Na
Possible C–H bond dissociation
pathways of methanol in interacting with Si2Li and Si2Na are explored and illustrated in Figure 6. Among three different TSs associated with cp.Li.a, the pathway involving ts-Li.a,24 yielding
product 24, characterized by the lowest energy barrier
of 37 kcal/mol, is an endothermic process. Meanwhile, two remaining
pathways via TSs ts-Li.a,22 and ts-Li.a,23 with higher energy barriers of 42 and 39 kcal/mol to form products 22 and 23 are equally exothermic. In spite of
the high energy barriers, the C–H bond cleavage pathways in
the presence of Si2Li cluster still have the benefit of
a strong interaction between Si2Li and methanol over the
isolated reactants. As a consequence, the overall barriers for these
pathways of cp.Li.a are now only 18, 20, and 24 kcal/mol,
with respect to the separated reactants, as demonstrated in Figure 6a. With the higher
energy barriers, the C–H bond breaking on Si2Li
cluster is much less favored than the O–H bond counterpart.
This can be again understood by the absence of hydrogen bond in the
structure of TSs involved in the former pathways.

Figure 6 Schematic potential-energy
profiles displaying the C–H bond
cleavage pathways of methanol in the presence of the Si2Li (a) and Si2Na (b) clusters. Relative energies in kcal/mol
were gained from CCSD(T)/CBS + ZPE computations.

In the Si2Na case, two different TSs are found
for each
Si2Na–CH3OH complex, as shown in Figure 6b. It is interesting
to note here that the energy barriers obtained for the C–H
bond breaking from the two complexes cp.Na.a and cp.Na.b are nearly the same. Indeed, the pathway of cp.Na.a via TS ts-Na.a,26 is now competitive
with that of cp.Na.b via TS ts-Na.b,28 with
the same energy barrier of 35 kcal/mol. The remaining pathways of cp.Na.a and cp.Na.b via TSs ts-Na.a,25 and ts-Na.b,27 are characterized by higher energy barriers
of 41 and 40 kcal/mol, respectively. The similarity in the barrier
heights of these two complexes can be understood by considering the
structural resemblance of the relevant TSs (cf. Figure 6b). Nevertheless, thanks to a larger adsorption
energy of cp.Na.a compared to that of cp.Na.b, the lowest dehydrogenation pathway with an overall barrier of 21
kcal/mol is now found for the pathway of cp.Na.a via
TS ts-Na.a,26. As the overall energy barrier is smaller,
the reaction occurs more easily. By comparison with the O–H
bond rupture pathways in the presence of Si2Na discussed
above, the C–H bond dissociation channels are obviously less
preferred, similar to the case of Si2Li.

2.3.2.3 With the Assistance of Si2Cu
and Si2Ag
All possible pathways for breaking C–H
bond of methanol when interacting with Si2Cu and Si2Ag clusters are shown in Figure 7. With the help of Si2Cu, three
different possible channels emerge for cp.Cu.a and cp.Cu.c to break the C–H bond, involving three different
TSs ts1-Cu.a,29, ts2-Cu.a,29, and ts-Cu.c,30. The reaction through ts-Cu.c,30 is
exothermic, whereas the reactions proceeding through ts1-Cu.a,29 and ts2-Cu.a,29 are endothermic. The TS ts-Cu.c,30 gives rise to the lowest energy barrier of 45 kcal/mol, whereas
the ts2-Cu.a,29 results in the highest barrier of 58
kcal/mol (cf. Figure 7a). The difference in energy barriers from such TSs is mainly due
to their stability ordering as individual species through different
interplay and ring strain. Ts-Cu.c,30 could have the
highest relative stability because of the stable nonplanar four-membered
ring structure and the smallest Si–H bond length in the C–H···Si
bond. Meanwhile, ts1-Cu.a,29 is only 4 kcal/mol higher
in energy barrier than ts-Cu.c,30 because it is less
stable owing to the presence of a three-membered ring structure, which
imparts strain in the system (Figure 7a). The bond length of Si–H in C–H···Si
elongates to 0.3 Å in the case of ts2-Cu.a,29 compared
to Ts-Cu.c,30 and thus leads to its higher barrier. Although
the difference in barrier height between ts1-Cu.a,29 and ts-Cu.c,30 is quite small, their overall energy barrier gap
becomes significant due to the high interaction energies of −26
kcal/mol obtained from the formation of the complexes cp.Cu.a as compared to that of −6 kcal/mol of cp.Cu.c. Accordingly, the overall energy barriers are lowered substantially
and the TS ts1-Cu.a,29 connecting cp.Cu.a and product 29 is now at 16 kcal/mol lower than that
between cp.Cu.c and 30 (via ts-Cu.c,30) (Figure 7a). The
lower the overall energy barrier is, the more easily the reaction
occurs.

Figure 7 Schematic potential-energy profiles showing the C–H bond
cleavage reaction of methanol with the assistance of the Si2Cu (a) and Si2Ag (b) clusters. Relative energies in kcal/mol
were obtained from CCSD(T)/AVTZ-PP + ZPE computations.

In contrast to the Si2Cu case, four
different TSs found
in the case of Si2Ag originate from the most stable complex cp.Ag.a. Figure 7b displays the schematic potential-energy profile illustrating the
C–H bond cleavage on supported Si2Ag cluster. Three
TSs, including ts-Ag.a,31, ts1-Ag.a,32,
and ts-Ag.a,33, are close in energy barriers of 45, 42,
and 44 kcal/mol, respectively. Meanwhile, the other ts2-Ag.a,32 induces the largest barrier
height of 64 kcal/mol and is thus less feasible. Even though these
pathways are characterized by high energy barrier, thanks to the high
interaction energy of −19 kcal/mol when forming the complex cp.Ag.a, their overall energy barriers now decline significantly
(cf. Figure 7b). Accordingly,
the lowest overall energy barrier of this channel via ts1-Ag.a,32, wherein the hydrogen in the C–H bond is bridged to a Si–Si
bond in Si2Ag, amounts now to only ∼23 kcal/mol.

2.4 Comparison of Different Pathways
2.4.1 Comparison between Si2H, Si2A (A = Li,
Na), and Si2B (B = Cu, Ag)
For the purpose of
comparison, the lowest energy barriers of the
C–H and O–H bond cleavage pathways of these studied
clusters are summarized in Table 2. The energy barriers in the O–H bond scission
are consistently much smaller than those computed for the C–H
bond scission for all clusters considered, and the dissociation via
the former case is therefore much more energetically favorable. Consequently,
of the two possible pathways, the O–H bond dissociation reaction
appears to be dominant when assisted by all clusters discussed above.

Table 2 Energy Barriers for O–H and
C–H Bond Rupture Pathways of Methanol on Various Materials
catalyst	overall O–H activation barrier (kcal/mol)	overall C–H activation barrier (kcal/mol)	ref	
Si2H	2.0	22.2	 	
Si2Li	–3.5	18.0	 	
Si2Na	6.8	21.2	 	
Si2Cu	5.3	23.5

Cu3	14.4	 	(22)	
Pt3	7.5	–3.1	(29)	
PtAu2	4.2	–6.7	(29)	
Among the clusters considered, the
lowest energy barriers of both
O–H and C–H cleavage pathways are found for the Si2Li case. The most remarkable feature here is the absence of
the overall energy barrier for the O–H breaking channel in
the presence of Si2Li. It means that this process can be
achieved without the need of adding any extra energy to the separated
reactants. This can be explained through the strength of hydrogen
bonds present in the stable ts-Li.a,7. The main reason
is that the small radius of the lithium atom stabilizes the Li–O···H
bond in this TS. With the catalytic effect of Si2H, the
overall energy barrier for the O–H rupture is characterized
by only 2 kcal/mol, and this pathway now has the second-lowest energy
barrier among the clusters studied. In general, both methanol activation
pathways with the help of the alkali metals (IA elements: Li, Na)
and hydrogen atom are more kinetically favored than the coinage metals
(IB elements: Cu, Ag), apart from Si2Na case for the O–H
cleavage (Table 2).
In a main group, along with the rising atomic number, the activation
barrier for both O–H and C–H bond scissions has a tendency
to increase. Meanwhile, this trend is found to be reversed for the
coinage metals (Table 2).

2.4.2 Comparison with Effects of Triatomic Clusters
Comparing with pure transition-metal clusters of the same size,
such as Cu3 and Pt3, which are considered to
be excellent catalysts, the energy barriers for O–H bond dissociation
promoted by Si2M with M = H, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag are consistently
smaller (cf. Table 2). Particularly, replacement of two Cu atoms in Cu3 cluster
by two Si atoms giving Si2Cu induces a large reduction
of ∼9 kcal/mol in the O–H activation energy barrier.
Obviously, the catalytic ability of the clusters toward the O–H
bond breaking of methanol can be enhanced upon doping silicon atoms
or substituting some metals by Si atoms. For the doped TM clusters
PtAu2, only Si2Li and Si2H exhibit
better catalytic property than PtAu2 for the O–H
bond breaking. The overall energy barrier with the help of the other
clusters is slightly higher than that of PtAu2 with a maximum
barrier difference of only ∼3 kcal/mol. On the other hand,
the energy barriers for the C–H bond rupture in the presence
of the clusters studied are calculated to be higher than those of
Pt3 and PtAu2. As a result, the selection of
various elements results in specific catalytic effects on the different
bond activation of methanol. Accordingly, a suitable dopant can generate
an effective catalyst, which reduces the energy barrier of selective
reactions.

Our recent study34 on
methanol activation catalyzed by Sim–nYn with Y = Be, Mg, Ca, m = 3, 4, and n = 0–1 indicated
that with the catalytic effect of the Si3 and Si2Y, the O–H activation has taken place more efficiently with
the absence of overall energy barrier (Table 2). Compared to that on Si3 and
Si2Y, the O–H bond cleavage on the clusters considered
(Si2M) is kinetically less favored, apart from Si2Li case in comparison with Si3. Furthermore, it can be
seen clearly from Table 2 that the energy barriers for the methanol activation are inclined
to decrease when M in Si2M goes from IA to IIA group. With
regard to the assisted methanol activation by Si2Cu and
Si2Ag, the calculated barriers for both O–H and
C–H scissions are generally higher with respect to earth-alkali
mixed silicon clusters, namely, Si2Be, Si2Mg,
and Si2Ca, except for Si2Ca in the case of C–H
bond cleavage.

Although our computations are conducted in vacuum
making use of
the isolated gas-phase clusters without taking the effect of solvent
on the reactivity into account, it should also be emphasized that
gas-phase clusters are appropriate model systems for examining the
reactions occurring on catalytic surfaces.48 Moreover, an investigation of the reactions of free clusters can
supply valuable information for comprehending the mechanisms associated
with the complicated and realistic catalytic systems. It is also expected
that the solvent effect should have similar impact on the reactivity
of the clusters studied and therefore the key deductions reached from
our gas calculations are expected to remain unchanged. In the present
study, our chief goal is to provide a comparative investigation on
the catalytic abilities of different clusters (Si2M) and
search for new and efficient catalysts toward the methanol activation.
Nowadays, the new trend for gas-phase catalysis using clusters is
rapidly emerging in both experimental and theoretical aspects, for
example, CO oxidation catalyzed by free palladium clusters,49 interaction of water with free manganese oxide
clusters,50,51 and so forth.

3 Concluding Remarks
In the present theoretical study, the
mechanisms of methanol activation
in the presence of small mixed silicon species Si2M with
M = H, Li, Na, Cu, and Ag were examined using density functional theory
(B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ) and wavefunction (CCSD(T)) methods. Although geometries
were explored using DFT computations, coupled-cluster CCSD(T)/CBS
single-point electronic energy computations, using B3LYP/aVTZ geometries,
were carried out to obtain energetics of the complexes and reaction
parameters. Total atomization energies and heats of formation of small
triatomic Si clusters were predicted using CCSD(T) and G4 (in some
cases) approaches. The main conclusions drawn from our computations
are as follows:(1) All of the most stable complexes obtained
upon interplay between methanol and the mixed silicon species Si2M with M = H, Li, N, Cu, and Ag have the low-spin (doublet)
ground state. In general, all lowest-lying complexes arise from an
M–O interaction rather than the Si–O connection, except
for the Si2H case.

(2) In all cases studied, the O–H
bond cleavage pathways are found to be dominant.

(3) Both O–H and C–H bond
dissociations of methanol with the catalytic effect of the Si2Li cluster are the most kinetically favored pathways. Especially,
with the help of Si2Li, no overall barrier is found for
the O–H breaking.

(4) The overall energy barrier for the
O–H and C–H bond cleavage following substitution of
one Si atom in Si3 cluster by a hydrogen atom and an alkaline
metal, namely, Li and Na, is identified to be lower than that of replacement
with a coinage metal like Cu and Ag, apart from Si2Na in
the case of O–H rupture. In fact, the catalytic effects of
Si2Na for the O–H bond activation seem to be not
as good as both Si2Ag and Si2Cu cases whose
energy barriers are calculated to be lower.

(5) Substitution of two Cu atoms in the
Cu3 cluster by Si atoms gives rise to a substantial decrease
of the O–H activation barrier. Moreover, the energy barriers
for the O–H dissociation pathway with involvement of the clusters
considered (Si2M) generally turn out to be smaller than
the values reported previously for transition-metal clusters of the
same size, for example, Pt3 (with M = H, Li, Na, Cu, and
Ag) and PtAu2 (only Si2Li and Si2H). As a consequence, both silicon atoms and mixed silicon clusters
emerge as efficient alternative catalyst(s) for the O–H dissociation
of methanol and are therefore expected to result in similar effects
for the Y–H bond activation of other organic molecules containing
M–H bonds.

(6) Along
with our recent study which
indicated that Si2Ca and Si3Ca are efficient
catalysts for methanol activation among all of those examined in previous
reports, the bestowed results in this study open a new avenue for
finding auspicious alternatives for the metal-based catalysts currently
used, in which small doped silicon clusters emerge as realistic catalysts
toward methanol activation. The main challenge is thus in the experimental
generation and use of these small gas-phase silicon species.



4 Computational Methods
All electronic structure computations are initially conducted making
use of the density functional theory (DFT) method implemented in the
Gaussian 09 suite of program.52 Geometries
of all stationary structures studied are first optimized using the
hybrid B3LYP functional53,54 in conjunction with
the 6-311+G(d) basis set. The popular hybrid B3LYP functional is widely
employed in previous investigations for both pure and doped silicon
clusters, including the clusters considered,44,55−58 and the reactions of methanol.18,24,34,59,60 In previous studies, the B3LYP functional was found to provide energetic
data consistent with experiment or high-accuracy molecular orbital
computation, such as the coupled-cluster theory CCSD(T). Improved
geometrical parameters are then reoptimized using the same functional
but with the larger basis sets, namely, aug-cc-pVTZ (denoted hereafter
as aVTZ) basis set for H, C, O, Si, Li, Na, and Cu atoms and aug-cc-pVTZ-PP
for Cu and Ag atoms (denoted as aVTZ-PP, where PP stands for pseudopotential).
In the case of Si2Cu, the use of two different basis sets,
including aVTZ and aVTZ-PP for Cu atom, yields the same relative-energy
profiles. In this context, we present only the results obtained from
aVTZ-PP in comparison with the case of Si2Ag. Harmonic
vibrational frequency analyses are implemented at the same level of
theory to confirm the nature of the stationary structures and to evaluate
the zero-point correction energies (ZPEs). Intrinsic reaction coordinate61 profiles are calculated at the B3LYP/aVTZ (aVTZ-PP)
level to ensure that the transition structures (TSs) found are correctly
connected. As for a convention, each TS mentioned in the following
sections is represented by a label of ts-A,B, where A and B are the two connecting energy minima.

With the aim of gaining more accurate energetics, the structures
optimized at B3LYP/aVTZ (aVTZ-PP) are then used for a series of single-point
electronic energy calculations using the coupled-cluster theory CCSD(T)
with the correlation-consistent basis set aug-cc-pVnZ with n = D, T, and Q (denoted as aVnZ). Total energies obtained from these single-point computations
are then extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) energies using
expression 1(62) 1  where n = 2, 3, and 4 for
the aVnZ basis sets, E(n) and ECBS are the CCSD(T)/aVnZ and CCSD(T)/CBS energies, respectively, and B and C are fitting parameters. However, due to the
limitation of our computation resources, the energetic parameters
of reactions involving both systems Si2Cu and Si2Ag are only reported at the CCSD(T)/aVTZ-PP level. Relative energy
values given in the tables and figures displayed in the text are given
in kcal/mol with a decimal figure. To facilitate reading, all energetic
values, obtained from CCSD(T) + ZPE computations, mentioned in the
following sections, are rounded up without decimal figure.
