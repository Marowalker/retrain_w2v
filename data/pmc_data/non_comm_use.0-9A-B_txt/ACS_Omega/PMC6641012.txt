We report a novel
molecular architecture of peptide–phospholipid
coassemblies. The amphiphilic peptide Ac-18A-NH2 (18A),
which was designed to mimic apolipoprotein α-helices, has been
shown to form nanodisc structures with phospholipid bilayers. We show
that an 18A peptide cysteine substitution at residue 11, 18A[A11C],
forms fibrous assemblies with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine
at a lipid-to-peptide (L/P) molar ratio of 1, a fiber diameter of
10–20 nm, and a length of more than 1 μm. Furthermore,
18A[A11C] can form nanodiscs with these lipid bilayers at L/P ratios
of 4–6. The peptide adopts α-helical structures in both
the nanodisc and nanofiber assemblies, although the α-helical
bundle structures were evident only in the nanofibers, and the phospholipids
of the nanofibers were not lamellar. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis
revealed that the peptide and lipid molecules in the nanofibers exhibited
different solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity from those of the
nanodiscs. Furthermore, the cysteine substitution at residue 11 did
not result in disulfide bond formation, although it was responsible
for the nanofiber formation, suggesting that this free sulfhydryl
group has an important functional role. Alternatively, the disulfide
dimer of 18A[A11C] preferentially formed nanodiscs, even at an L/P
ratio of 1. Interconversions of these discoidal and fibrous assemblies
were induced by the stepwise addition of free 18A[A11C] or liposomes
into the solution. Furthermore, these structural transitions could
also be induced by the introduction of oxidative and reductive stresses
to the assemblies. Our results demonstrate that heteromolecular lipid–peptide
complexes represent a novel approach to the construction of controllable
and functional nanoscale assemblies.

Introduction
The self-assembly of
biomolecules is a key component in the creation
of nanomaterials.1−3 These nanomaterials have
a wide variety of structures and have been shown to have functional
applications that can be applied to drug delivery, bioimaging, and
biosensors. Biomolecules, including proteins and peptides, nucleic
acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, exhibit significant promise as building
blocks in the synthesis of functional nanoassemblies, as a result
of their plasticity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.3 The design and synthesis of these nanoscale assemblies,
incorporating these biomolecules, has been extensively studied, resulting
in versatile architectures in a variety of shapes, sizes, and surface
properties. For instance, phospholipids are known to self-assemble
into spherical micelles, hollow vesicles (liposomes), and hexagonal
phase and planar lamellar structures, based on their chemical structures
and the surrounding conditions.4 Peptide-based
nanoassemblies have also been examined and shown to achieve well-ordered,
tunable structures, such as nanofibers, nanotubes, and nanoparticles
that can adopt specific secondary polypeptide chain structures, including
β-sheets and α-helices.5−7 Furthermore, the conjugation
of hydrophobic aliphatic groups to hydrophilic biomolecules, including
peptides and DNA, results in amphiphilic building blocks including
peptide amphiphiles8−10 and DNA amphiphiles.11 The conjugation of these biomolecules has been shown to be a powerful
strategy in the initiation of self-association, via hydrophobic interaction,
and in the construction of uniform nanoassemblies with representative
functional hydrophilic moieties on their surfaces. Previous studies
have also demonstrated the structural transition of these nanoassemblies,
as a result of external stimuli,3,5,12 and the structure-dependent release of incorporated pharmaceuticals.13 Therefore, the regulated structural transition
of these assemblies implies that they are functional nanomaterials
with important implications for nanomedicine. Whereas the majority
of self-assembling nanostructures previously examined are composed
of only a single building block, ubiquitous biological complexes,
including ribosomes, viruses, and lipoproteins, are mixtures of molecules
in different classes: proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and
lipids. Here, we show that cooperative noncovalent interactions between
the molecules of different types can result in the generation of a
well-organized bioactive complex. Furthermore, although it is a challenging
task to design, synthesize, and manipulate nanoassemblies, consisting
of a combination of different types of building blocks, we show that
these constructions can mimic biological structures. However, our
knowledge of the design principles for heteromolecular nanobioassemblies
remains limited because of a lack of an appropriate model system for
investigating the self-assembly processes.

Lipoproteins are
nanoscale particles composed of lipids and proteins,
including apolipoprotein A-I, that circulate in the blood and transport
cholesterol.14 Recently, a discoidal lipoprotein-like
particle, the lipid nanodisc, has become of particular interest in
the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, and medicine.15 This lipid nanodisc consists of an amphiphilic α-helical
polypeptide chain containing a membrane scaffold protein, a fragment
of apolipoprotein A-I, and has been shown to wrap around phospholipid
bilayers. Discoidal nanoparticles have also been shown to form, via
self-assembly, between the apolipoprotein mimetic peptide Ac-18A-NH2 (18A) and phospholipid mixtures, as described by Anantharamaiah
et al.16,17 In this study, we examine peptide-based
lipid nanodiscs as a model system for self-assembling heteromolecular
complexes based on the following characteristics: First, these nanoparticles
can spontaneously form by simple mixing in a buffer. Second, synthesis,
amino acid mutation, and chemical modification of peptides are relatively
straightforward. Third, the dimensions, structures, and functions
of these complexes are tunable. Finally, α-helical peptides
and phospholipids are both cylindrical molecules, despite possessing
very different amphiphilic structures. Amphiphilic α-helical
peptides have opposing polar and nonpolar faces oriented along the
long axis of the helix, whereas phospholipids have a polar headgroup
connected by long hydrophobic acyl chains. Therefore, we expect that
the structure and function of these binary nanoassemblies will be
governed by a delicate balance between the structure and the stoichiometry.4 Previously, we have shown that the native chemical
ligation of thioester-modified peptides stabilizes nanodiscs and that
the diameter of the disks is dependent on the L/P molar ratio in solution.18 We also demonstrated the dynamic self-reproduction
properties of these lipid–peptide nanodiscs and that these
lipid–peptide interactions are highly dependent on the amino
acid sequence.19 For example, replacing
amino acid residues of 18A by phenylalanine at various positions or
connecting two amphiphilic helices by a short linker affected the
solubilization of phosphatidylcholine liposomes.20 However, the relationship between the amino acid sequence
of these amphiphilic peptides and the structure of noncovalent peptide–lipid
nanoassemblies remains unclear.

Here, we show that a single
amino acid substitution in the apolipoprotein
mimetic peptide 18A causes a drastic structural transition in peptide–phospholipid
nanoassemblies. The mutant form of 18A, 18A[A11C], in which an alanine
at residue 11 is replaced by a cysteine residue, forms not only nanodiscs
with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) but also nanofibers,
depending on the L/P ratio or reductive conditions affecting the cysteine
side chain. The component molecules adopted different structures and
exhibited altered solvent accessibility in these assemblies. Furthermore,
we also observed a reversible interconversion between these heteromolecular
nanoassemblies.

Results
Effect of Amino Acid Substitution
on 18A[A11X]–POPC Nanoassembly
Formation
To investigate the role of the primary structure
of the amphiphilic 18A peptide on nanodisc formation with the POPC
lipid bilayer, we generated several 18A variants via amino acid substitution
at residue 11: 18A[A11X], where X = S, T, N, V, M, Y, D, G, P, or
C (Figure 1). The native
residue at position 11, alanine, is near the center of the primary
structure at the interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic
faces of the amphiphilic α-helix. Therefore, we hypothesized
that a mutation at this location would result in a change to the physicochemical
properties of the amphiphilic peptide, affecting the formation of
the peptide–lipid nanoassemblies. We examined hydrophilic residues
(serine, threonine, asparagine, and aspartic acid), hydrophobic residues
(valine and methionine), and an aromatic residue (tyrosine) for changing
the surface property of the peptides. Glycine and proline were used
for disrupting the α-helical structure of the peptides. Substitution
by the cysteine residue, which can form a disulfide bond, was also
investigated. Figures 2 and S1 show the resulting changes in
the normalized right-angle light scattering intensity of POPC large
unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), with a mean diameter of ∼100 nm,
followed by the addition of the mutated 18A peptides.18,19 The scattering intensity gradually decreased with the addition of
18A at L/P molar ratios of 1, 2, and 4, resulting in the formation
of nanodiscs with smaller hydrodynamic diameters than those of POPC
vesicles, as previously reported (Figure 2a). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis
showed that the distribution of the hydrodynamic diameter was less
than or equal to 10 nm (Figure S2a), in
accordance with the previous reports describing the discoidal particles
observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging.18 Similar to 18A, the mutated 18A[A11X] peptides
(where X = S, T, N, V, M, Y, and G) also exhibited reduced right-angle
light scattering intensities of the POPC vesicles, indicating the
formation of small particles, including nanodiscs (Figure S1). The 18A[A11G] mutation at an L/P ratio of 4 resulted
in an increase in the scattering intensity for 1 h, while the signal
decreased near zero for 1 day (data not shown), indicating a transient
aggregation of the peptide and lipid vesicles. However, the 18A[A11P]
mutation showed no significant change in the scattering intensity,
suggesting no nanodisc formation. This is likely due to the propensity
of proline to disrupt α-helical structures.21 The disruption of charge distribution in the 18A[A11D]
variant caused only small changes in the scattering intensity and
suppressed the nanodisc formation.

acid (MOPS)/1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-2Na buffer
(pH 7) at 25 °C. (c,d) Negatively stained TEM images of 18A[A11C]–POPC
assemblies at L/P ratios of (c) 1 and (d) 4.

Nanofiber and Nanodisc Formation between 18A[A11C] and POPC
In contrast to these mutated 18A peptide variants described, we
found that the cysteine substitution at residue 11, 18A[A11C], increased
the scattering intensity when the L/P ratio was equal to 1, indicating
the formation of coassemblies larger than the initial size of the
POPC vesicles (Figure 2b). Our DLS results indicated that the hydrodynamic diameter of these
assemblies was approximately 1 μm when an isotropic spherical
particle is assumed (Figure S2b). Furthermore,
fibrous assemblies, with widths of 10–20 nm and lengths of
>1 μm, were observed in the negatively stained TEM images
(Figures 2c and S3). However, in the absence of lipid vesicles,
18A[A11C] did not exhibit significant light scattering, indicating
that lipid molecules are required for the assembly. Therefore, to
confirm the presence of the nanofiber assemblies observed in the TEM
images between the 18A[A11C] peptide and the POPC lipids, we employed
fluorescence microscopy imaging (Figure 3). POPC liposomes, treated with rhodamine-labeled
dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and fluorescein-labeled 18A[A11C],
were combined with unlabeled peptides prior to the preparation of
the peptide–lipid assemblies. The subsequently observed colocalization
of rhodamine and fluorescein signals in the fibrous aggregates indicated
that the nanofibers were indeed a mixture of lipids and peptides.
The observed fibrous structures, at optical resolution, suggested
a lateral association of the nanofibers, forming thick fibril bundles,
as seen in the TEM images (Figure S3).
Furthermore, we were able to precipitate these aggregates by centrifugation
(10 000g, 10 min), and although the fluorescein-labeled
18A[A11C] peptide did not form nanofibers with POPC autonomously,
approximately 40% of the peptide was incorporated into the nanofibers
formed by the unlabeled 18A[A11C] (data not shown).

and fluorescein-18A[A11C]; (a,c,e) fluorescein signals; and (b,d,f)

The 18A[A11C] variant
resulted in a decrease in the scattering
intensity at an L/P ratio of 4 and the formation of nanoscale particles
similar to the other 18A-derived peptides (Figures 2b and S2b). Discoidal
particles of 18A[A11C]–POPC, with diameters of 10–20
nm, were observed in the TEM images (Figure 2d). Rouleaux structures, characteristic of
nanodiscs,16,18,22 were also evident (Figure 2d, arrowheads). These results indicate that 18A[A11C]–POPC
nanodiscs are formed when the L/P ratio is equal to 4. The right-angle
light scattering intensities, as a function of the POPC–18A[A11C]
molar ratio, are shown in Figure S4. The
scattering intensities of the lipid vesicles increased when the L/P
ratio was low (≤2); however, they decreased at the higher L/P
ratios of 3 to 6. At L/P ratios of 8 and 16, no changes were observed
in the signal, suggesting that at lower concentrations the peptide
did not induce deformation of the vesicle structures. We have also
found that the nanofiber could not be formed at a low concentration
of 18A[A11C] (<10–6 M), even at an L/P ratio
of 1, probably because of the reduced amount of the peptide bound
to the lipids (data not shown).

To further investigate the molecular
basis of the observed nanofiber
formation of 18A[A11C] and POPC, we substituted the cysteine residue
at 11 with S-methyl-l-cysteine and found
that this mutant did not result in nanofiber formation but did allow
for nanodisc formation at an L/P ratio of 1, 2, and 4, as determined
by a decrease in the light scattering intensity (Figure S1). We also found that the position of the cysteine
residue was critical for the nanofiber formation (Figure S5). We synthesized three mutants: 18A[L3C], 18A[A5C],
and 18A[F6C], in which the cysteine residues were incorporated at
the hydrophobic face, the hydrophilic face, and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
interface of the α-helical structure, respectively. These peptide
variants did not result in an increase in the light scattering intensity
when added to the POPC vesicles, indicating that nanofibers were not
formed. However, it is notable that 18A[A11C] did not form intermolecular
disulfide bonds in these nanofibers and nanodiscs, which we confirmed
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Figure S6). Although metal ions accelerate the
formation of disulfide bonds,23 the addition
of EDTA-2Na suppressed the formation of disulfide bonds by preventing
interaction between the metal ions and the thiol groups.13 By contrast, the synthesized 18A[A11C] disulfide
dimers result in a decrease in the scattering intensity in combination
with the POPC vesicles, resulting in the formation of small particles
at L/P ratios of 1, 2, and 4 (Figure 4), as shown in the TEM images of the formation of nanodiscs.
Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum analysis of the
18A[A11C] dimer at an L/P ratio of 1 revealed two local minima at
208 and 222 nm, similar to the monomer nanodiscs at an L/P ratio of
4 (Figures S7 and 5a, see below). These results indicate that the monomer and dimer
peptides experienced similar nanodisc environments. These results
indicate that the free sulfhydryl group of cysteine at residue 11
plays a pivotal role in the nanofiber formation.

Molecular Structure of the 18A[A11C] Peptide and POPC Lipid
Nanoassemblies
The CD spectrum of 18A[A11C] in buffer revealed
an α-helical structure, as shown by the local minima at approximately
208 and 222 nm, whereas the spectrum of the peptide at an L/P ratio
equal to 1 exhibited a large negative minimum at approximately 225
nm and a small shoulder at 208 nm, implying an aggregation of α-helices
in the nanofibers (Figure 5a).24,25 The large negative band at 225
nm arising from the formation of exciton coupling via stacking of
aromatic side chains, including the indole ring of tryptophan, strongly
suggests the formation of intermolecular α-helical bundles of
the peptides in the nanofibers.26,27 The spectrum at an
L/P ratio equal to 4 also indicated the presence of α-helical
structures formed by the peptide in the nanodiscs similar to the 18A
peptide as shown in previous reports.18 The peptide and lipid structures in the nanofibers were further
investigated using a solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscope (Figure 5b,c). The natural
abundance of 13C in the nanofibers, with a magic angle
spinning (MAS) at 14.6 kHz, exhibited narrow peak widths (e.g., ∼1.2
ppm at 18 ppm for Ala5/17Cβ), indicating uniform
molecular structures in the assembly.28 The carbonyl 13C peak at approximately 178 ppm, indicative
of the peptide backbone, showed a downfield secondary shift, suggesting
that 18A[A11C] adopted an α-helix-rich structure,29 in accordance with the CD spectrum results.
The static 31P spectrum of POPC in the nanofibers exhibited
a powder pattern, rather than the uniaxial symmetrical pattern typically
observed in the lamellar phase,30,31 suggesting a deformation
of the lipid bilayer. The narrower bandwidths observed (∼130
ppm), in contrast to those of solid phospholipid powders (∼200
ppm), indicate the residual dynamics of the lipid molecules in the
assemblies. Limited sensitivity of the spectrum makes the detailed
analysis difficult. Although the dynamics of the lipid headgroup may
deform the spectrum obtained by cross-polarization (CP), the experimental
spectrum indicates that the headgroup is in a static state. This experimental
spectrum is quite different from that for lipid bilayers in which
lipids rotate uniaxially.31

Characterization
of the 18A[A11C]–POPC Assemblies by
Fluorescence Spectroscopy
To characterize the structure of
the 18A[A11C]–POPC coassemblies, we performed fluorescence
spectroscopic analysis. The tryptophan fluorescence spectrum of 18A[A11C]
showed an increase in the signal intensity and a blue shift in the
maximal wavelength, coincident with the formation of nanofibers and
nanodiscs followed by the addition of POPC vesicles, suggesting that
the tryptophan side chain was localized to the hydrophobic regions
of these assemblies (Figure 6).32 To determine the accessibility
of the tryptophan residue to the solvent, we performed a fluorescence
quenching assay. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured in the presence
of acrylamide, a water-soluble quencher of fluorescence (Figure 6b). A linear Stern–Volmer
plot of 18A[A11C], in the absence of POPC, revealed a large Stern–Volmer
constant (KSV) of 13.9, suggesting that
the tryptophan residue was fully exposed to the solvent.33 The KSV values of
the peptides in the nanodiscs and nanofibers were 4.5 and 4.1, respectively,
indicating that the tryptophan side chain was partially buried in
these assemblies. However, the linear Stern–Volmer plot results
indicate that none of the peptides were fully sequestered from the
external aqueous phase.32

(a) Fluorescence spectra at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm in
20 mM MOPS/1 mM EDTA-2Na buffer (pH 7) at 25 °C. L/P ratios equal
to 0 (black), 1 (blue), and 4 (green) are shown at an 18A[A11C] concentration
of 10 μM. (b) Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of the 18A[A11C]–POPC
assemblies by acrylamide at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Emission
wavelengths equal 330 nm (L/P = 1), 335 nm (L/P = 4), and 350 nm (L/P
= 0). The ratio of the fluorescence intensity before and after the
addition of acrylamide (F0/F) was plotted as a function of quencher concentration. The error
bars represent the mean ± SD (n = 2).

The solvent accessibility of the
lipid headgroups of these assemblies
was also examined. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) (0.5
mol %) labeled by nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) fluorophore was added
to the assemblies. The measured fluorescence intensity of NBD increased
from nanofiber to nanodisc to LUV, indicating differential hydrophobic
environments (Figure 7a).34 The NBD fluorescence was irreversibly
quenched by the addition of the water-soluble quencher sodium dithionite.
Approximately half of the fluorescence of the POPC LUVs was quenched
followed by the addition of the quencher, indicating that the NBD-DPPE
molecules in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer vesicles were
accessible to the solvent as predicted (Figure 7b).35 Nearly all
fluorophores were quenched in the nanodisc and nanofiber assemblies,
suggesting that all of the lipid molecules were accessible to the
solvent. The kinetics of fluorescence quenching for the NBD fluorophores
by dithionite also varied among the different assemblies, with the
nanofibers displaying the highest rate of quenching (Figure 7c). These results clearly indicate
that the microenvironment surrounding the peptides and lipids is dependent
on the morphology of these assemblies. Furthermore, our results show
that the headgroups of the lipids that were integrated into the nanofibers
had the highest solvent accessibility, reflecting a deformation of
the bilayer structures, as shown in our 31P NMR measurements.

are shown at a POPC concentration of 40 μM. The excitation and

of aqueous phase in the nanoassemblies.

To further determine the structure of these nanoassemblies,
we
examined the composition of the entrapped aqueous compartment of the
POPC vesicles, nanodiscs, and nanofibers, prepared in a buffer containing
calcein dye (Figure 7d).36 A membrane-impermeable ion, Co2+, was added to the solution to quench the fluorescence via
the formation of a chelate complex with calcein. The entrapped volumes
of these assemblies were determined via quenched fluorescence signals.
POPC vesicles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm displayed an
entrapped volume of 2.5 L/mol total lipid, in accordance with the
theoretical volume of 3.0 L/mol for vesicles with a diameter of 100
nm. Entrapped aqueous phases were nearly absent in the nanodiscs and
nanofibers, indicating no sequestered aqueous compartments in the
nanofiber and nanodisc assemblies.

Induced Transitions between
Fibrous and Discoidal 18A[A11C]–POPC
Assembly
Determining the precise timing of the transition
to supramolecular assemblies is challenging. Therefore, we evaluated
these structural transitions via the use of external stimuli. We alternately
added peptide and lipid vesicles to the POPC vesicle solution, thereby
altering the L/P ratio from 4 to 1. The right-angle light scattering
intensity both decreased and increased, in a stepwise manner, as shown
in Figure 8a, suggesting
the alternate formation of nanodiscs and nanofibers in this range.
These transitions, from nanodisc to nanofiber, appeared to be reversible,
which is supported by the observation that the final scattering signals
were not influenced by previous lipid–peptide mixing (Figure 8b). These results
demonstrate that reversible morphological transitions can be triggered
by a change in the molar ratio of lipid to peptide.

(a) I, 18A[A11C] (10 μM) added to the POPC vesicles (40 μM)
at an L/P ratio of 4; II, 18A[A11C] added to the POPC vesicles at
an L/P ratio of 1 (final concentrations of peptides and lipids were
both 37.7 μM); and III, POPC vesicles added to the solution
at an L/P ratio of 4 (final concentrations of peptides and lipids
were 36.9 and 148 μM, respectively). (b) 18A[A11C] and POPC
vesicles mixed over time at concentrations of 36.9 and 148 μM,
respectively. (c) Addition of the reducing agent TCEP to the 18A[A11C]
dimer–POPC nanodiscs at an L/P ratio of 1. The concentrations
of POPC and 18A[A11C] monomer were 40 μM. (d) Addition of the
oxidizing agent K3Fe(CN)6 to the 18A[A11C]–POPC
nanofibers (40 μM peptide and lipid) at an L/P ratio of 1. The
scattering intensity was normalized to the intensity of the POPC LUVs
before the formation of nanoassemblies in panels c and d, but not
in a or b.

As shown in Figure 4, the disulfide-linked dimers of 18A[A11C]
formed nanodiscs even
at an L/P ratio equal to 1, whereas monomeric 18A[A11C] formed nanofibers.
The addition of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), which reduces
disulfide bonds to free sulfhydryl groups,37 resulted in a large increase in the scattering intensity, for up
to 1 h, of the 18A[A11C] dimer–POPC nanodiscs at an L/P ratio
equal to 1 (Figure 8c). This indicates the formation of nanofibers resulting from the
interaction with 18A[A11C] monomers. Nearly all of the dimeric 18A[A11C]
reverted to monomers 1 h after the addition of TCEP, as confirmed
by HPLC. Furthermore, upon the addition of the oxidizing agent K3Fe(CN)6 to the 18A[A11C] monomer–POPC nanofibers,38 scattering was decreased after 9 h, indicating
a transition from nanofiber to nanodisc via dimer formation (Figure 8d). Therefore, our
results indicate that the morphologies of these nanoassemblies can
be controlled by the reduction of the cysteine residue in the 18A[A11C]
peptide.

Discussion
Cooperative self-assembly
of biomolecules of different classes
represents a novel strategy for constructing bionanomaterials with
a variety of structures and functions. Here, we demonstrate that the
amphiphilic α-helical peptide 18A[A11C] and POPC can cooperatively
assemble into not only nanodiscs at an L/P ratio equal to 4 but also
nanofibers at an L/P ratio of 1, as shown by our TEM and fluorescence
imaging results. Previous studies have shown that the diameter of
the lipid bilayer is regulated by the L/P ratio in 18A nanodiscs.16,18 By contrast, the nanofiber morphology in the 18A[A11C]–POPC
mixture at an L/P ratio of 1 suggests a significantly different arrangement
of the constituent molecules in the assembly from those of the nanodiscs.
Furthermore, these 18A[A11C]–POPC nanofibers have an apparent
novel molecular architecture. These 18A[A11C]–POPC nanofibers
formed α-helical bundles, as shown in our CD and 13C NMR spectroscopy results. This configuration is distinct from the
amyloid fibrils formed by pathogenic peptides such as amyloid-β,
in which the β-strands run perpendicular to the fiber axis,39 although the fibrillation of amyloid peptides
has also been reported to be facilitated by lipid membranes.40,41 Similar β-sheet structures have been reported in nanofibers
formed by peptide amphiphiles.8−10 Our 18A[A11C]–POPC nanofibers
resemble the peptide nanofibers described by Woolfson et al., exhibiting
similar CD spectra and TEM images, where the leucine zipper motifs
formed helical bundles, resulting in the assembly of nanofibers.24,25 However, our results clearly demonstrate that phospholipid molecules
were also integrated into the nanofibers. The 31P NMR spectrum,
showing a nonuniaxial symmetry pattern, suggests a deformation of
the lamellar structure of the lipid bilayer in these nanofibers. Although
the amphiphilic α-helix of 18A[A11C] does not have a defined,
complementary interface for bundle formation similar to the leucine
zipper motif, the POPC molecules appear to bind to the hydrophobic
patches between the associated α-helices and stabilize the fibrous
aggregates. The disruption of the lipid bilayers observed in these
nanofibers also differs from the protein-mediated tube formation of
lipid membranes induced by BAR domains.42 Domanov and Kinnunen reported that lipid nanotubes, with diameters
of less than 250 nm, formed upon the addition of an antimicrobial
peptide to supported phospholipid bilayers at an L/P ratio of approximately
5.43,44 Lee et al. demonstrated that a de novo designed
amphiphilic peptide formed Golgi-like nanotubules with Golgi-specific
lipids.45 The morphology of the tubules
is similar to that of our 18A[A11C]–POPC nanofibers in terms
of the length and diameters. However, the tubules were formed at L/P
ratios of 2.5–10, suggesting that the stoichiometry and the
structures of constituent molecules in these assemblies are different.

Our results indicate that nanofiber formation by these 18A-derived
peptides is specific to the A11C mutation. Furthermore, a free sulfhydryl
group is required. Other amino acid substitutions, including the structurally
conservative amino acids such as alanine, serine, and threonine, did
not result in nanofiber formation. However, previous studies have
shown that the conservative amino acid substitution of a cysteine
residue does not always maintain the structural and molecular recognition
properties of the proteins.46 Cysteine
residues have been shown to play several pivotal roles in molecular
interactions. Intra and intermolecular van der Waals interactions,
weak hydrogen bonding, and slight hydrophobicity appear to be critical
for the nanofiber formation.47−49 Nonhydrogen bonding interactions
with carbonyl, amide, and aromatic groups in proteins have also been
reported to be important for these molecular interactions.49 Interestingly, Cys11 disulfide bond formation
induced nanodisc formation even at an L/P ratio of 1, suggesting that
the intermolecular cross-linking of the cysteine residues constrained
peptide conformations to unfavorable positions for nanofiber formation.
Thus, connecting two adjacent peptides at their hydrophobic/hydrophilic
interfaces may be more favorable for nanodisc formation when taking
the double belt model into account,50,51 in which two
amphiphilic α-helical chains wrap around the lipid bilayers.
A cysteine mutation at the other side of the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
interface (F6C mutant) did not result in the fiber formation, suggesting
that the position of residue 11 was also important for the interhelical
interactions in the nanofibers. Further structural analysis of these
nanofibers using imaging and spectroscopic techniques, including cryo-electron
microscopy and high-resolution SSNMR analysis combined with isotope-labeled
peptides and lipids, will provide an increased understanding of the
mechanisms underlying these molecular interactions at an atomic resolution.

The 18A[A11C]–POPC complexes exhibited a reversible transition
between the nanodisc and the nanofiber depending on the L/P ratio
and redox state of the cysteine residue. The structural transitions
of nanobioassemblies, resulting from external stimuli, have been reported
in multiple systems, including liposomes, peptide nanofibers, and
peptide amphiphiles.3,5,12 Structural
changes can be critical for bioactivity, including the release of
incorporated drug molecules, which is necessary for the development
of nanomedicines. We found no internal aqueous phase sequestration
from the external solution in the 18A[A11C]–POPC nanofibers,
unlike in our observations of the POPC liposomes (Figure 7d), indicating that they are
unsuitable for carriers of hydrophilic drugs and imaging agents. However,
this 18A[A11C]–POPC nanodisc/nanofiber system has potentially
attractive applications for nanomaterials. We observed significant
changes in the surface accessibility in the integrated molecules during
the disk-to-fiber transition (Figures 6 and 7). This indicates that
the molecular recognition of these surface-presented molecules may
be regulated by structural transitions. The wide-ranging changes in
the size (nanometers to micrometers) between the nanodiscs and nanofibers
allow them to be easily separated using basic laboratory techniques
such as centrifugation. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that
nanodiscs are suitable substrates for the structural and functional
analysis of membrane proteins via the incorporation of the protein
in the lipid bilayer of the disks and dispersal in solution.52 Indeed, the structures of membrane proteins,
including outer membrane protein X and transient receptor potential
vanilloid 1 ion channel, into nanodiscs have been shown by solution
NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy, at atomic resolutions,
respectively.53,54 Nanodiscs also show promise as
potential drug carriers.15 Alternatively,
peptide-based nanofibers have been examined for use in diverse applications
including tissue engineering.55 Therefore,
the stimuli-induced transitions seen in our nanodisc-to-nanofiber
assemblies may enable the further manipulation of multifunctional
nanoassemblies.

Conclusions
In this study, we show
that the amphiphilic peptide 18A[A11C] forms
both nanodiscs and nanofibers cooperatively with the phospholipid
POPC. We also demonstrate that the morphologies of these heteromolecular
complexes are influenced by the amino acid sequence of this peptide,
the L/P ratio, and the redox state of the cysteine residue. Furthermore,
the reversible structural transition between the nanofiber and the
nanodisc could be induced via external stimuli. These lipid–peptide
nanofibers have a unique supramolecular architecture, in which the α-helical
peptide bundles are associated with nonlamellar phospholipid molecules.
Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation
of supramolecular structures, utilizing a mixture of biomolecules
from different classes, and demonstrate a novel, rational design for
nanomaterials that may be utilized in future applications involving
peptide–lipid nanoassemblies.

Experimental Procedures
Peptide
Synthesis
Peptides were synthesized manually
using Fmoc-based solid-phase synthesis. To generate fluorescein-labeled
18A[A11C], a fluorescein moiety was introduced into the N-terminus
of the peptide using 5-carboxyfluorescein in the presence of N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide and
1-hydroxybenzotriazole in dimethylformamide on resin.56 The dye-labeled proteins were protected from light to avoid
photodegradation. The peptides were cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic
acid/water/1,2-ethanedithiol/triisopropylsilane (92.5/2.5/2.5/2.5)
for 3 h and purified via reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) on a C18 HPLC
column over a gradient of water to acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid. The peptides were characterized by HPLC and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Autoflex-T1,
Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). The 18A[A11C] disulfide-linked dimers
were prepared using 18A[A11C] monomers (1 mM) incubated in a buffer
(20 mM MOPS, pH 7) containing 50% dimethyl sulfoxide for 1 week and
purified using RP-HPLC.57 Lyophilized peptide
powder was dissolved in water, and the concentration was measured
at an absorbance of 280 nm. Peptide stock solutions were stored at
−25 °C until use.

Lipid Vesicle Preparation
POPC, with a purity greater
than 99%, was purchased from the NOF Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). NBD-DPPE
and rhodamine-DOPE were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL). The LUVs were prepared via the extrusion method as previously
described.18 Briefly, aliquots of lipids
in chloroform/methanol (2/1) were transferred to round-bottom flasks,
and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The residual
lipid film was dried under vacuum overnight. A buffer solution (20
mM MOPS/1 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7) was added to the lipid film to form multilamellar
vesicles (MLVs) and subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing.
The MLV suspension was filtered through a 100 nm pore polycarbonate
filter 31 times to form the LUVs. The size of the LUVs was determined
using a DelsaMax Core dynamic light scattering instrument (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA).

Light Scattering
Formation of the
supramolecular assemblies
by peptides and lipids was monitored by right-angle light scattering
using an F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)
with a quartz cell of 4 mm path length set in a cell holder at 25
°C.18,19 The peptides (0, 10, and 40 μM) and
the LUVs (40 μM) were mixed into the buffer (20 mM MOPS/1 mM
EDTA-2Na, pH 7). Excitation and emission wavelengths were measured
at 650 nm with slit widths of 5 nm. The DLS of the nanodiscs and nanofibers
was measured using a DelsaMax Core instrument (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA).

CD Spectroscopy
The CD spectra of the assemblies in
the buffer (20 mM MOPS/1 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7) were measured at 25 °C
using a J-805 spectrometer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan), with a 1 mm path
length quartz cell. Eight scans were averaged for each sample. The
spectrum of the lipids in the LUVs was subtracted as a blank.

Tryptophan
Fluorescence and Quenching Assays33
The fluorescence spectra were measured using an
F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Before acquisition
of the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum, 18A[A11C] (10 μM) and
POPC LUVs (0, 10, and 40 μM) were mixed in the buffer (20 mM
MOPS/1 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7) in a quartz cell with 4 mm path length at
25 °C and incubated for at least 1 h. The excitation wavelength
was set to 295 nm. Acrylamide was added to the sample solutions to
quench the fluorescence signals of the tryptophan residues. The fluorescence
intensity, as a function of the acrylamide concentration, [Q], was
analyzed using the Stern–Volmer equation, F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q],32 where F0 and F are the intensities in the presence and absence
of the quencher, respectively. The Stern–Volmer constant KSV was measured using least linear fitting of
the plot.

NBD Fluorescence and Quenching Assays35
POPC/NBD-DPPE (99.5/0.5) LUVs (40 μM lipid) and 18A[A11C]
(0, 10, and 40 μM) were mixed into the buffer (20 mM MOPS/1
mM EDTA-2Na, pH 7) in a quartz cell with 4 mm path length at 25 °C
and incubated for 2 h. Fluorescence intensities were recorded at an
excitation wavelength of 460 nm and an emission wavelength of 534
nm. During signal recording, sodium dithionite in 2 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
solution was added into the cell after 120 s to a final concentration
of 8 mM to quench the NBD moieties accessible to the solvent. Triton
X-100 was added to the sample (1%) to disrupt the assemblies after
960 s.

Evaluation of the Entrapped Aqueous Volume36
POPC LUVs were prepared in a buffer containing
calcein dye (20 mM MOPS/0.1 mM calcein, pH 7). LUVs (1 mM) were incubated
in polypropylene tubes in the absence and presence of 18A[A11C] (0.25
and 1 mM) for 2 h at 25 °C. The samples were diluted 100-fold
in a calcein-free buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7) to a final volume of 300
μL. The fluorescence intensity at 530 nm was recorded at an
excitation wavelength of 490 nm. After 120 s, a CoCl2 solution
was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM to quench the calcein
fluorophore outside of the assemblies by the chelation of Co2+. Then, 30 μL of 10% Triton X-100 (1%) was added to complete
the quenching by disrupting the assemblies after 360 s. The fraction
of the entrapped calcein in the assemblies, E, was
calculated as E = (F2 – 1.1·F3)/(F1 – 1.1·F3), where F1 and F2 are the
fluorescence intensities of the calcein before and after the addition
of CoCl2, respectively, and F3 is the intensity after the addition of Triton X-100. The entrapped
volume of the aqueous phase in the assemblies for 1 mol of lipid was
determined by V = E/[Lipid] (L/mol),
where [Lipid] indicates the concentration of POPC before the dilution
(1 mM).

Transmission Electron Microscopy18
A glow-discharged Cu grid coated with a thin carbon film
(300 meshes) was placed on a droplet of the sample for 5 min. Then,
the excess sample solution on the grid was removed using a filter
paper. Next, the grid was placed on a droplet of 2% phosphotungstic
acid for 30 s and dried after the removal of the excess solution.
TEM images were obtained using a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope
(JEOL Inc., Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 keV.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Nanofibers were prepared by
mixing peptides and lipid vesicles as described above. Here, LUVs
doped with 1 mol % of rhodamine-DOPE were used. Fluorescein-labeled
18A[A11C] (5 mol %) was added to the nonlabeled peptide. The sample
solution was placed on a glass slide and sealed by a coverslip. Fluorescence
imaging was conducted using the BX51 microscope equipped with a 100
W mercury lamp and a DP50 digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
The U-MWIB2 (excitation filter, 460–490 nm; emission filter,
510 nm; and dichromatic mirror, 505 nm) and U-MWIG2 (excitation filter,
520–550 nm; emission filter, 580 nm; and dichromatic mirror,
565 nm) mirror units were employed for the detection of fluorescein
and rhodamine fluorescence signals, respectively.

SSNMR Spectroscopy
Nanofiber sample (5 mg) was packed
into a 3.2 mm MAS ZrO2 rotor by ultracentrifugation (120 000g, 20 min) using the Beckman Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge
equipped with the SW40Ti rotor. A custom-made rotor adaptor was utilized
for the direct packing of the nanofibers into the NMR rotor from the
suspension. SS 13C and 31P NMR experiments of
nanofibers were performed using JEOL ECA II spectrometers at 1H resonance frequency of 700 and 500 MHz, respectively. 13C NMR was observed with a repetition time of 3.0 s at an
MAS frequency of 14.6 kHz and a sample temperature of 5 °C. 31P NMR was observed under a static condition with a repetition
time of 7.0 s at 25 °C. Time-domain 13C and 31P signals were acquired under two-pulse phase modulation 1H decoupling at an rf amplitude of 78 kHz58 following CP from 1H with a contact time of 2.0 ms.59 The free induction decays for 13C
and 31P NMR with a spectral width of 100 kHz were multiplied
by an exponential function with a dumping rate of 50 and 300 Hz, respectively,
and were zero-filled to 4096 points using the Delta NMR software (JEOL
Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The 13C NMR spectrum was obtained
by subtracting the background signals recorded for a blank rotor.
The 13C chemical shift was referenced to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic
acid.60
