Annealing of block copolymers has
become a tool of great importance
for the reconfiguration of nanoparticles. Here, we present the experimental
results of annealing block copolymer nanoparticles and a theoretical
model to describe the morphological transformation of ellipsoids with
striped lamellae into onionlike spheres. A good correspondence between
the experimental findings and predictions of the model was observed.
The model based on finding the steepest direction of descent of an
appropriate free energy leads to a set of Cahn–Hilliard equations
that correctly describe the dynamical transformation of striped ellipsoids
into onionlike spheres and reverse onionlike particles, regardless
of the nature of the annealing process. This universality makes it
possible to describe a variety of experimental conditions involving
nanoparticles underlying a heating process. A notable advantage of
the proposed approach is that it enables selective control of the
interaction between the confined block copolymer and the surrounding
medium. This feature endows the model with a great versatility to
enable the reproduction of several combined effects of surfactants
in diverse conditions, including cases with reverse affinities for
the block copolymer segments. A phase diagram to describe a variety
of morphologies is presented. We employ the relationship between the
temperature-dependent Flory–Huggins parameter and the width
of the interfaces to account for changes in temperature due to the
heating process. Simulation results correctly show how the transformation
evolves as the temperature increases. This increment in temperature
corresponds to progressively smaller values of the interfacial width.
We anticipate that the proposed approach will facilitate the design
and more precise control of experiments involving various kinds of
annealing processes.

1 Introduction
Fine-tuning
the individual structures of the building blocks in
nanomaterials enables the function and properties of polymeric materials
to be controlled.1 Other fields as diverse
as colloids2 and lyotropic liquid crystals,3 among others, also strive to gain a deep understanding
of the changes in the shape and structure of the constitutive elements
to gain precise control of the self-assembly processes.4 In live systems, transformations during self-assembly
often involve profound changes in symmetry, such as those observed
in the gastrulation phase in early embryonic development.5−7

For inorganic materials, it is possible to tune the synthesis
parameters
to control the shapes of the nanoparticles and obtain nanoparticles
a few nanometers wide.8,9 In the case of organic materials,
morphological control is rapidly developing, and it is now possible
to control the shape of domains of a similar scale.10−16 The interest in the latter case is partially motivated by the desire
to synthesize bioinspired materials with applications in drug delivery,17−25 among others.26−30

There are several aspects that contribute to the self-assembly
of block copolymer (BCP) nanoparticles. For instance, the symmetrical
composition of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene (PS-b-PI) in solution often results in nanoparticles with a
layered morphology,12 whereas asymmetrical
composition leads to a variety of configurations.31−33 Furthermore,
by controlling the interaction between the solvent and the segments
of the BCP, it is possible to fine-tune the nanosurfaces.34

Annealing is commonly used to modify the
orientation and symmetry
of polymeric nanoparticles.35,36 Common types of annealing
include thermal annealing and solvent annealing. Surfactant addition
is another method that influences the morphology and shape of the
particles by modifying the interfacial interaction between the BCP
and the surrounding medium.

Thermal annealing directly employs
heat to bring BCP nanoparticles
to a certain temperature to induce an order–order phase transition
in the material.37,38 Cavicchi and Russell developed
a technique that involved exposing the polymer to vapor of a good
solvent, and they managed to complete the annealing process within
1 h.39 The transformation time can be considerably
reduced from several weeks to a few minutes by using microwaves as
a source of heat.38,40,41 Because it is desirable to carry out experiments in a short amount
of time, this method is a notable contribution.

The addition
of a surfactant also facilitates changes in the shape
and internal morphology of BCPs. Notable examples involve the inclusion
of gold nanoparticles to induce elaborate transformations of the BCP
from a spherical to a lens shape42 or to
a striped ellipsoidal particle.43 Temperature-responsive
surfactants allow the production of ellipsoidal and convex lens BCP
particles when polymer droplets are stabilized at high and low temperatures,
respectively.44 In another example of using
surfactants to tune the interfacial properties of the BCP particles,
a dramatic morphological transition from spherical to convex lens-shaped
BCP particles was observed when the aspect ratio of CuPt nanorod surfactants
was changed.45 Using a mixture of surfactants,
the morphologies can be transformed from onionlike to striped ellipsoidal
particles46,47 and striped ellipsoids into nanosheets with
a hexagonal structure of homopolymer cylinders.48 In another case, when using mixtures of various compositions
of the two surfactants, an even richer variety of morphologies resulted:
onionlike particles, ellipsoids with striped lamellae, and reverse
onions. In the first and last cases, one component of the mixture
of surfactants dominates, whereas in the layered case, both components
balance one another.49 One more example
of exquisite crafting comes from a study in which 10 nm-sized graphene
quantum dots behave as surfactants with tunable properties to produce
nanoparticles of different shapes: spheres, reverse spheres, and convex
lens.50

Taking the solvent parameters
into consideration provides another
method of creating intricate nanoparticle morphologies (solvent annealing).51,52 Li et al. showed that one can use controlled precipitation from
the good/poor solvent mixture to modulate the swelling and annealing
of nanoparticles suspended in aqueous media.53 Furthermore, in a different setting, it has been shown that solvent-induced
reconfiguration processing of onionlike nanoparticles in ethanol produces
selective swelling, and one must consider three factors: size, nanostructure,
and the composition of the BCP. These factors intertwine to control
the swelling behavior of the nanoparticles.54 By using the process of solvent annealing, it is possible to produce
reversible morphologies when combining the adsorption of chloroform
and controlling the concentration of polyvinyl alcohol.55 Another aspect that plays a significant role
in the configuration of BCP is the rate at which the solvent evaporates.
Rapid evaporation results in a layered morphology, but a slow rate
allows only one of the segments in the BCP to reach the outermost
layer because of the preferential interaction of the segment with
the external matrix.56 Another remarkable
feature of the process of solvent annealing is that an inorganic precursor
can be used to modify the morphology and shape of nanoparticles.57 A common trend among several of the morphological
transformations mentioned so far involves the structural changes of
ellipsoids with striped lamellae into onionlike spheres. These changes
in shape can also be found in other systems.3,58

Despite the large number of situations in which the transformation
of striped ellipsoids into onionlike spheres appears, along with several
techniques that have been developed to anneal nanoparticles, little
effort has been made to understand the transformation process from
an energy point of view.59 In this work,
we present a model based on an energy functional with short- and long-range
contributions to describe this transformation. An appropriate minimization
scheme of this energy functional leads to a set of Cahn–Hilliard
equations that correctly describe the experimental results of thermal
annealing.

Although Cahn–Hilliard equations are based
on a small number
of parameters, they provide a robust qualitative model to predict
many kinds of possible morphologies and offer a guideline on how confined
BCPs behave dynamically when the parameters are changed, regardless
of the specifics of the annealing method employed.34,60,61 For a wide range of processes involving
the heating of BCPs in solution, this model establishes a clear parameter
correspondence between, for instance, the temperature-dependent Flory–Huggins
parameter and the width of the interface of the microphases. The universality
of the model serves as a theoretical basis to design and perform experiments.

We have organized this paper as follows. We begin by describing
a series of experimental settings for annealing in water and microwave
annealing, followed by a description of the model with a particular
emphasis on how the parameters of the model are related to the experimental
quantities. The dependence on temperature is explained, and the numerical
details are also addressed. A corresponding phase diagram is introduced
afterward, along with a discussion on the transformation of a striped
ellipsoid into an onionlike sphere and reverse onion morphology. We
present our conclusions at the end.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Experimental Results
2.1.1 Water Annealing
Figure 1 shows a sequence of samples
at different temperatures to illustrate the transformation of a striped
ellipsoid into an onionlike morphology in PS-b-PI
nanoparticles produced by annealing in water. The dispersions were
kept for two weeks. At low and high temperatures (25 and 40 °C),
particles exhibit unidirectional stacked layer and onionlike morphologies,
respectively. The transformation also has an intermediate stage at
30 °C, in which the particle has a semionion morphology. To understand
this transformation, we recall that at a low temperature, the segments
of the BCP PS-b-PI interact with similar strength
with the solvent; thus, both components are equally able to reach
the surface. This leads to the formation of particles with layered
structures.

Figure 1 STEM images of PS-b-PI at different stages of
the morphological transformation of a striped ellipsoid into an onionlike
particle using annealing in water at different temperatures. From
left to right, 25, 30, and 40 °C. As the temperature increases,
the layers curl up to allow the polymer segments with more preference
for water to maximize their contact with the surrounding medium, and
at higher temperatures, only the PI segments are exposed to water.
At 40 °C, the outermost layer of the onion particle is composed
of PI segments. Mn (PS) = 17.8 kg/mol
and Mn (PI) = 12.0 kg/mol. PI segments
are stained with OsO4 to brighten them in the STEM images.

To offer some insight into how
the interaction between copolymer
segments changes with temperature, we measured the interfacial tensions
between water and PS (57.9 mN/m) and between water and PI (55.8 mN/m).
The measured values indicate that the PI segments have a slightly
higher preference for the water phase. Although it is challenging
to obtain precise measurements of the contact angles and interfacial
tensions at variable temperatures using the present equipment, the
Flory–Huggins theory states that the free energy of a mixture
increases linearly with increasing temperatures. It is therefore reasonable
to expect higher interfacial tension values at higher temperatures.
The upshot is that increasing the temperature leads to reduced values
of the Flory–Huggins parameter, making water a better solvent
for the PI segments. This in turn facilitates the interaction of these
segments with the solvent, and thus, the PI segments will be more
likely to reach the surface of the particles. These particles will
be characterized by an onionlike structure with their preferential
outermost layer in contact with the solvent. In section 2.5, it will be shown that
onionlike morphologies are energetically stable.34

Another relevant aspect to consider is the effect
of the particle
size on the transformation process. It has been previously reported
that particles smaller than 200 nm rapidly evolve from a disordered
state into an onionlike morphology, whereas larger particles remain
unchanged even after annealing at 30 °C for two weeks.37,38 Nevertheless, this initially stiff structure of a striped ellipsoid
was eventually transformed into an onionlike sphere after annealing
at 40 °C for two weeks.

2.1.2 Microwave
Annealing
Annealing time,
in general, decreases at high temperatures. One of the greatest advantages
of microwave annealing over water annealing is a reduction in the
processing time from weeks to several minutes. Figure 2 shows the different stages of microwave
annealing for the transformation of striped ellipsoids into onionlike
particles. In the experiments, when the nanoparticle dispersion was
annealed at 60 °C, the transformation into onionlike particles
required about 60 min.38 At the slightly
higher temperature of 70 °C, at each point in time, we observed
the following ordered structures. First, unidirectionally stacked
layered structures and then transformed layered structures were formed
in the nanoparticles after annealing for 5 min. After 25 min, semionion
and onionlike structures were observed in the nanoparticles. In contrast,
annealing at 90 °C resulted in the formation of the onionlike
structures after only 5 min.

Figure 2 STEM images of PS-b-PI to show
different stages
of the morphological transformation of a striped ellipsoid into an
onionlike particle using microwave annealing from 60 to 90 °C.
Microwave annealing allows the morphological transformation to be
completed within a few minutes, whereas conventional thermal annealing
requires several days to complete the transformation. As the temperature
increases, several stages of the transformation develop, namely, striped
ellipsoid, semionion, and onion. The semionion stage has a number
of substages in which some layers are partially exposed to the surrounding
medium. At higher temperatures, only the outermost layer is exposed
to water. Mn (PS) = 135 kg/mol and Mn (PI) = 131 kg/mol. PI segments are stained
with OsO4 to brighten them in the STEM images.

An explanation of the notable reduction in the
processing time
is in order. Microwaves provide a fast and uniform heating mechanism,
and although the dielectric constant of the polymers is low, they
still partially absorb a small amount of radiation, providing extra
molecular motion to the polymer segment with a preferential interaction
toward water. Thus, the segment with preferential interactions reaches
the surface of the particle to form an onionlike morphology. Despite
the fact that a systematic study to analyze the effect of temperature
on the interaction of each polymer segment with water is still pending,
it is reasonable to expect that the transformation will take place
at a faster rate if the polymer segment has a higher affinity for
water. The results of water and microwave annealing presented in this
work exhibit identical features of the morphological transformation
of striped ellipsoids into onionlike spheres shown in electron tomography
observations previously reported.37

2.2 Theoretical Model
2.2.1 Dynamical
Equations
In the following
theoretical model, we assume that a BCP particle is immersed in an
external medium, which could be a homopolymer, a solvent, or water,
for instance. Hereafter, without the loss of generality of the model,
we refer to the external medium as the homopolymer.62 This model for the mixture of two systems has been previously
described.34 The morphologies consist of
two main components, namely, a confinement surface to keep a particle
located in a section of the spatial domain and a BCP component within
the surface, which undergoes phase separation.

The first component
in the mixture is a blend of the homopolymer or water and an AB-type
BCP. This component is described by order parameter u, and it acquires values within the interval [−1, 1], with
the end points of the interval corresponding to the homopolymer-rich
domain (−1) and the BCP-rich domain (+1). The boundary between
the homopolymer and the BCP domains defines the boundary of the BCP
particles. The second component is described by order parameter v, which defines the state of the AB-type BCP, and it also
acquires values from the interval [−1, 1], with the end points
corresponding to A and B, respectively.

When the two systems
mentioned above interact with one another,
a macrophase separation described by u generates
a region in which a BCP particle will be located and surrounded by
the homopolymer. A microphase separation then takes place inside the
separated BCP domain, which in turn is described by v. The dynamics of the state of these two mixed systems evolves to
minimize the value of an energy functional as in the following expression 1  where 2  

In eq 1, Ω
is
a smooth bounded domain in RN. Here, we
focus on the three-dimensional confinement and thus N = 3. Parameters ϵu and ϵv, are proportional to the thickness of the
propagating fronts of each component. These parameters control the
size of the interface between the macrophase and the microphase. v̅ is the mass ratio between two polymers. We set
σ ≠ 0 to turn on the long-range interactions in eq 1 that are needed to obtain
particles with a fine structure, such as striped ellipsoids or onionlike
spheres. To represent the long-range interactions in the original
formulation of the energy functional for a problem with one component,
Ohta and Kawasaki59,63 used Green functions. Nishiura
and Ohnishi64 introduced an elegant formulation
using the fractional power of the Laplace operator, which is more
suitable for variational problems. Unlike the local operator ∇,
which considers only interactions between neighboring positions, the
nonlocal operator (−Δ)−1/2 must be
evaluated over the entire domain Ω to correctly account for
the long-range interactions related to σ.

The double-well
potential in eq 2 represents
two different possible states in a phase
transition, −1 or +1. This function has two dimensions and
coupling parameters α, β, and γ. We set γ
= 0.

The coupling parameter α causes symmetry breaking
between
the microphase-separated domains, and by changing its value, we can
control the interaction between the confining surface and the confined
BCP. To understand how the coupling parameter α affects the
confined morphologies, Figure 3 shows contour plots of W(u, v) for different values of α. If α
= 0, the contour lines in Figure 3a are symmetrical, which indicates that u has equal preference for any value of v, either
positive or negative. For instance, in the case of a layered morphology,
both positive and negative values of v of the particle
are equally able to reach the confining surface because α =
0. Conversely, if α ≠ 0, then the contour plot is asymmetrical,
as shown in Figure 3c, and thus the preference of u for v depends on whether v is positive or negative. α
≠ 0 would be appropriate to simulate a confining surface with
more preference for one of the BCP segments, as in the case of onionlike
particles among others. The coupling parameter β affects the
free energy depending on the value of u, as v2 > 0. For most of the cases presented here, u̅ < 0, and thus the energy term involving β in eq 2 raises or lowers the double well
when β < 0 or β > 0, respectively.

Figure 3 (a) Energy contour plot
of W(u, v) in eq 2 with α = 0 (symmetric
plot). In this case, u has equal preference for v < 0 or v > 0. P1, P2, and P3 are
locations where (u, v) are, respectively,
(−1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, −1). P2 and P3 are located at the boundary within which a particle is confined.
(b) Schematic figure of the confined particle in one dimension. This
is the case of α = 0, where the confining surface has equal
preference for v < 0 or v >
0.
Notice that the confining surface defined by v is
not rigid, but rather it adopts the undulations of v at the surface of the particle. (c) Energy contour plot of W(u, v) with α ≠
0 (asymmetric plot). In this case, u has different
preference for v < 0 or v >
0.

The associated Euler–Lagrange
system of equations corresponding
to the mixed system comprises two coupled Cahn–Hilliard equations,
as follows 3   4   5   6  

F is defined in eq 1,
and parameters τu and τv are time constants to control
the speed at which parameters u and v move. Equations 4 and 6 constitute a mixture of two coexisting systems:
one with σ = 0 and the other with σ ≠ 0. The former
separates a confined BCP nanoparticle from the surrounding external
medium, and the latter system with σ ≠ 0 allows the nanoparticle
to form microphases. The parameter α controls the affinity of
the surrounding medium for the confined particle in such a way that
as α increases, the preference for a BCP segment increases accordingly.
The proposed approach allows the problem to be solved by integrating
a set of equations for the whole system, thus avoiding the explicit
treatment of the boundary conditions at the interface between the
BCP and homopolymer domains.

2.2.2 How
the Temperature-Dependent Flory–Huggins
Parameter Relates to the Interface Width
To account for thermal
changes during the annealing process, we need to relate the dynamical
evolution of the state of the system to changes in temperature. Equations 4 and 6 correctly describe the time evolution of the order parameters u and v. Although these equations are not
explicitly temperature-dependent, it is known that the interfacial
width between BCP segments diminishes with the temperature-dependent
Flory–Huggins interaction parameter, χAB,
as follows (see refs (65) and (66)) 7  

Moreover, the effective value of χAB increases with temperature as follows (see refs (67) and (68)) 8  where χAS and χBS correspond to polymer A with solvent and polymer B with
solvent, respectively. R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, ν is the molar volume, and δ
is the solubility parameter. If one of the segments in the BCP has
more preference for the solvent, then (χAS –
χBS)2 enlarges χAB, which
in turn leads to a reduction in the value of the interfacial width,
ϵv ∝ 1/T1/2. The approach that we use consists of dividing the
process of thermal annealing into a sequence of stages, each one at
a constant temperature (constant ϵv). At each stage, eqs 4 and 6 are valid, and we can correctly account
for the heating process.

Because of technical limitations, it
is extremely demanding to
obtain direct measurements of the interfacial thicknesses of the phases
formed in the particles. On the other hand, Helfand and Tagami65,66 proved—theoretically and experimentally—that there
is a robust relationship between the variations in temperature and
the changes in the interfacial thickness of a polymer in bulk. We
rely on these relationships to develop our model, and it will be shown
that this model successfully reproduces the experimental results in
BCP particles.

2.3 Simulation of Annealing
of Nanoparticles
Here, we describe the simulation of the
annealing process. First,
we need to select a suitable initial condition at an appropriate initial
temperature in a cubic lattice. Because at room temperature the external
medium has equal preference for any segment of the BCP, the initial
condition should be a particle with unidirectionally stacked lamellae
(striped ellipsoid) with α = 0. When the parameter responsible
for the affinity of the external medium for the segments of the BCP
is set to zero, the corresponding contour plot of the energy is symmetrical,
as shown in the contour plot in Figure 3a. Now, we proceed to select an initial value for the
temperature of the striped ellipsoid. According to eqs 7 and 8, the
temperature is related to the width of the interface as T ∝ 1/ϵv2. A reasonable
choice for the interface width of a typical striped ellipsoid is ϵv = 0.020, and we progressively decrease this
value until we reach a desired lower limit, corresponding to a final
upper temperature. We perform this scheme for different values of
α.

We start with α = 0 for the simplest case of
annealing. In this case, the interfacial width diminishes as the temperature
rises, and this narrowing of the interface results in more room available
for the formation of additional layers. In other words, in this case,
the total number of stacked layers in the particle increases during
the heating process, although the striped ellipsoid does not transform
into an onionlike particle. To analyze the effect of the strength
of the interaction with the external medium, the symmetry of the energy
contour in Figure 3a must be broken up by selecting nonzero values for α. We select
the following values to simulate a moderate preference of the external
matrix for one of the BCP segments: α = 0.23, 0.25, 0.27, and
0.3. Smaller values of α seem to be insufficient to complete
the morphological transformation, and the values of α > 0.3
correspond to different experimental parameters.

We simulate
annealing while keeping a record of the changes in
morphology for different values of α. Then, we use this information
to analyze the relationship between α and the dynamic morphological
changes.

Figure 4 shows several
stages during the morphological transformation for α = 0.3.
During the transformation, order parameters u and v vary accordingly in a complicated manner. However, we
can appreciate how these parameters are intertwined by considering
their projection onto a direction that is parallel to the main axis
of the particle. Figure 5 illustrates how u and v vary in
time and space, as seen in one of the three spatial dimensions of
the domain. Notice that the order parameter u remains
mostly unchanged during the transformation because its main role is
to establish a boundary for the particle, and the particle remains
confined during the process. On the contrary, the order parameter v undergoes profound changes in its distribution within
the body of the particle, which is why the variations in v are more noticeable than those of u. Naturally,
the evolution of u and v will look
different when projected in different directions.

Figure 4 Changes in morphology
during the transformation of an ellipsoid
with striped lamellae into an onionlike sphere for α = 0.3.
Half-section views of three-dimensional isosurfaces with an inclination
about the z-axis are shown to make the internal features
of the transformation visible. Insets: Cross sections of the morphologies.
Isosurfaces at an appropriate threshold are shown for the order parameter v < 0 (blue) and v > 0 (green). Values
of the interfacial width, ϵv, are
shown in each case along with the cumulative number of time steps
(in parenthesis). Projections onto the x-axis of
order parameters u and v during
the morphological transformation are shown in Figure 5. We select stages [a–e] to analyze
the evolution of the energy of the transformation (see Figure 8).

Figure 5 Projection onto the x-axis of order parameters u and v during the morphological transformation
of an ellipsoid with striped lamellae into an onionlike sphere for
α = 0.3. The order parameter u is depicted
in red, and v is represented as a histogram of intensities.
The size of the bar represents the magnitude of v along the x-axis. Green bars correspond to v > 0, and blue bars correspond to v <
0. Values of ϵv are shown in each
case along with the cumulative number of time steps (in parenthesis).
Each profile in this figure corresponds to the stages shown in Figure 4.

The transformation process for moderate values
of α is similar,
with the notable difference that the transformation develops faster
for larger values of α, which is expected because a strong preference
for a BCP segment facilitates the transformation process. To account
for the duration of the transformation, we define the completion time tc as the total time required for the initial
striped ellipsoid to complete the transformation into a closed onionlike
particle. As an example, for α = 0.23 and α = 0.30, the
onion is complete at tc = 47 000
time steps (at ϵv = 0.010) and tc = 28 000 time steps (at ϵv = 0.014), respectively. Figure 6 shows that tc diminishes with α and that once the transformation
process is complete, the final state is a steady onionlike morphology.

spheres for progressively increasing the values of α (left to
right). Top to bottom: Cross sections of the three-dimensional morphology
taken at different times to show the transformation in detail. The
simulation starts from a common initial condition shown at the top
and then the interface width, ϵv, decreases progressively. Values of ϵv are shown on the y-axis from top to bottom
with the cumulative number of time steps (in parenthesis). The order
parameter v is shown in blue for v < 0 and green for v > 0. The transformation
is completed after a period of time tc has passed (highlighted for each value of α). In this region
of parameters, tc decreases with α.
Full details of the transformation for α = 0.3 are shown in Figure 4.

2.4 Phase Diagram of Transformed
Morphologies
Figure 7 shows a
phase diagram to illustrate the various morphologies obtained in the
previous section. The diagram describes the morphologies resulting
from annealing at different values of α. For each value of α,
the heating process starts at a given temperature, which in turn depends
on the interface width as T ∝ 1/ϵv2.

Figure 7 Phase diagram of the
morphologies found in simulations for different
values of ϵv and α. The right y-axis represents the temperature, T ∝
1/ϵv2. The region between
the vertical dashed lines represents the results of transformations
of ellipsoids with striped lamellae to onionlike spheres, similar
to what is found in the experiments. The transformation process starts
with a layered morphology at ϵv =
0.020, and this value becomes smaller as the transformation progresses.
The transformation is complete after a period of time tc has passed, and a typical final result is shown in the
area between vertical dashed lines of the closed onionlike morphologies.
In this region, closing time, tc, decreases
with α. Some representative stages of the transformation are
shown in the diagram. The order parameter v is shown
in blue for v < 0 and green for v > 0.

The simplest case is α =
0. In this case, the interfacial
width diminishes when the temperature rises, and this narrowing of
the interface results in more room being available for additional
layers. However, in this case, the striped ellipsoid does not transform
into an onionlike sphere.

Now, we consider cases with α
≠ 0 and probe the parameter
space with a unidirectionally layered morphology. On the left-hand
side of the phase diagram, there is a region of small values of α
for which the affinity for the BCP segments is not very strong. In
this region, although the inner layers of the striped ellipsoid partially
curl up around the core, the external layers are unable to form closed
surfaces. In this case, the morphology remains open, even at high
temperatures.

When the value of α > 0 is barely larger
than the threshold
value, we enter into a region in which the preference for the external
medium is large enough to conduct a complete transformation from a
striped ellipsoid into an onionlike sphere. Within this region, layers
curl up to form onionlike shapes when we increase the temperature,
although for small values of α, the annealing of particles will
be slow and thus, the onions will take a long time to close their
external layer. As we increase the value of α, the preference
for the solvent increases accordingly, resulting in a reduction in
the annealing time. The transformation of a striped ellipsoid into
an onionlike sphere is still possible after an upper limit of the
value of α has been reached, although the intermediate stages
in this case appear to be significantly different in their inner morphology
than those in the cases with smaller α values, and they evolve
at different speeds. Morphologies with large values of α are
in the region on the right-hand side of the vertical dashed line at
α > 0.30 in the phase diagram in Figure 7. The curve with a positive derivative in
the figure represents a border numerically found that separates the
temperature at which the morphology closes its outermost external
layer.

During experiments, it is more common to observe transformations
within the region between the dashed lines in the phase diagram in Figure 7. This behavior can
be explained by the fact that both segments of the BCP used in the
experiments have a similar affinity for the solvent; thus, the relative
preference of the solvent for any of the two segments in the BCP is
quite similar. This situation corresponds to moderate values of α.
Values of α > 0.35 would be appropriate for experimental
conditions
involving stronger differences in the affinity of the segments, and
in such cases, it is reasonable to expect a transformation from a
striped ellipsoid into an onionlike sphere with intermediate stages
resembling a particle with intertwined layers at the core.

2.5 Energy of the Transformation
In this
section, we proceed to analyze the energy of the transformation. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the energy during the transformation
as the total sum in the energy functional in eq 1. During the simulation of annealing, we progressively
decrease ϵv, altering the energy
content of the abovementioned functional, and the upshot is that each
stage of the process has a different energy value. To compare the
energy at different stages of the transformation, first we need to
adjust the resulting morphologies to have common values of the parameter
ϵv and then let the system evolve
for a period of time. We perform this operation in several stages
for the cases with α = 0.30 and α = 0.35. The first case
corresponds to the transformation observed in Figure 4, which is the fastest case that exhibits
natural bending of the layers, similar to that observed in the experiments.
The second case corresponds to a transition in which the bending of
the layers is more pronounced because it causes the inner layers to
curl up and intertwine with one another (not shown here). Nonetheless,
the end result is also closed onions. Figure 8 shows both cases of α and demonstrates
that the general tendency is toward lower values of energy, which
is expected because onions are typically one of the most stable morphologies.
It is necessary to stress that Figure 8 does not represent the evolution of the transformation
shown in Figure 4 because
in the latter case, the interface width of the morphology progressively
dwindles. In contrast, in Figure 8, the interface is kept constant throughout the simulation
time.

Figure 8 Evolution of the energy in the transformation of a system with
α = 0.30 (solid) and α = 0.35 (dashed). To compare the
energies of different stages at α = 0.30, we placed the morphologies
shown in stages [a–e] in Figure 4 in a common parameter space with ϵv = 0.018 and then let the system evolve for another
1000 time steps. The insets in each panel show cross sections of the
morphology obtained at the end of 1000 time steps. The order parameter v is shown in blue for v < 0 and green
for v > 0. The arrows indicate the time at which
the morphology was complete. The decreasing values of the energy show
that the system evolves toward a more stable state during the transformation
of a striped ellipsoid into an onionlike sphere.

To additionally verify the robustness of the final onionlike
state,
we simulated the reverse process. We started the dynamics from an
onionlike morphology state and progressively increased the value of
ϵv to a value corresponding to a
striped ellipsoid, while keeping all the other parameters unchanged.
Our results suggest that the final onionlike state is quite robust
as this morphology remained unchanged for over 40 000 time
steps. This further confirms the experimental finding that the nanoparticles
transform irreversibly into onionlike particles.

2.6 Reverse Onionlike Particles
In this
section, we further expand the applications of our model. Klinger
et al. have used a mixture of two surfactants in solution with a BCP,
in such a way that one surfactant has more affinity for one segment
of the polymer, whereas the other surfactant has more affinity for
the other segment.49 The authors could
control the relative mass fraction of one surfactant with respect
to that of the other surfactant, and by adjusting the composition
of the mixture, they could obtain particles with reverse morphologies.

This raises the question of whether it is possible to reproduce
the results of the described experiment. Although in this setting
there are two competing components playing the role of the homopolymer,
and considering that these two components have opposite effects, our
model can be used to effectively reproduce the effect of the mixture
of the two surfactants by switching the sign of the parameter α,
which is responsible for the interaction between the BCP and the homopolymer.
When the mass fraction of one surfactant is dominant, we use α
> 0, and when the other surfactant is dominant, then α <
0. When the contributions of both surfactants balance one another,
we use α = 0.

In the numerical simulations, to realize
the transformation of
an ellipsoid into an onionlike sphere, we start with an initial condition
with a unidirectionally stacked layered structure and select an external
matrix with α > 0. Conversely, we select α < 0 to
obtain
a reverse onionlike morphology. A comparison of cases with α
> 0 and α < 0 can be found in the Supporting Information for this work.

3 Conclusions
We have presented experimental and numerical results of thermal
annealing of BCP nanoparticles and managed to correctly reproduce
the outcomes of experiments of annealing in water and microwave annealing
of particles 100 nm in diameter. The strength of our work is that
the proposed model describes the dynamics and the outcome of diverse
annealing processes in BCPs excellently, regardless of the particular
annealing technique used. The model is based on an energy functional
with short- and long-range contributions. Coupled Cahn–Hilliard
equations are used to describe the morphological transformations of
striped ellipsoids into onionlike forms, as seen in nanoparticles
undergoing an annealing process. To account for changes in the temperature,
we focused on the relationship between the temperature-dependent Flory–Huggins
parameter and the thickness of the interface, suggesting that T ∝ 1/ϵv2. A corresponding phase diagram of the morphologies was presented.
Both ellipsoids with striped lamellae and onionlike morphologies are
energetically stable, although onions are typically in a lower position
in the phase diagram of the energies of small particles.34 We have discussed how to relate the experimental
parameters of the annealing process to the simulation parameters of
the transformation of striped ellipsoids into onionlike spheres and
found that the speed of the process strongly depends on the affinity
of the external matrix for the segments of the BCP. The net effect
of increasing α is a reduction of the maximum annealing temperature.
The present findings might help to establish a firm theoretical basis
that can be applied to the design of experiments on annealing.

Furthermore, we have presented a scheme to produce onionlike and
reverse onionlike morphologies and discovered that for α >
0,
it is possible to anneal lamellae particles regardless of the ordering
of layers. However, in some cases of α < 0, a full transformation
is possible only if the ending caps of the particles have values of v > 0. This brings an intriguing possibility that might
be tested in the future, which we describe as follows.

Higuchi
et al. have shown that annealing in water produces a wide
distribution of nanoparticles with striped ellipsoids and onionlike
particles, the latter being the most numerous in the sample.37 However, a number of striped ellipsoid particles
remain unchanged. Experimentally, it is challenging to identify the
caps of the particles and even more ambitious is to control the ordering
of the layers in the nanoparticles. Our findings suggest that if the
ordering of the caps in nanoparticles is controlled, it would enable
a more precise outcome of the annealing process; thus, this area should
be addressed in the future. Another area of research would address
the annealing of large nanoparticles. Preliminary work suggests that
adding thermal noise to large particles might be needed to facilitate
the movement of local minimizers to reach a more stable state, similar
to that found in experiments. These additional challenges should be
addressed in forthcoming works.

4 Methods
4.1 Preparation and Annealing in Water of Nanoparticles
The BCP composed of PS and PI segments with similar segment volumes
of PS and PI was purchased from Polymer Source, Inc. (Dorval, Quebec,
Canada). The molecular characteristics of this BCP are summarized
in row one of Table 1. The BCP was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF, with stabilizer,
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) to a final concentration
of 0.1 g L–1. Deionized water (2 mL) was then added
to 1 mL of the BCP solution while stirring at 10 °C. Subsequently,
THF was gradually evaporated at constant temperatures ranging from
10 to 40 °C over 2 days, and the BCP precipitated as nanoparticles
in water.

Table 1 Molecular Characteristics of Polymers
name	Mn (PS) [g/mol]	Mn (PI) [g/mol]	Mw/Mn	fPI	
PS-b-PI-1	17 800	12 000	1.02	0.43	
PS-b-PI-2	135 000	131 000	1.10	0.47	
Annealing in water takes
place once the solvent evaporation has
been completed. The dispersion of nanoparticles is annealed with stepwise
increments of the temperature for two weeks. At each temperature,
the solution is sampled and then prepared for observation.

4.2 Microwave Annealing of Nanoparticles
Here, we used
a PS-b-PI BCP purchased from Polymer
Source, Inc. (Dorval, Quebec, Canada). The molecular characteristics
are shown in row two of Table 1. The preparation of the BCP is similar to that for annealing
in water, except that in this case, a rotary evaporator is used to
accelerate the evaporation of THF. Subsequently, the BCP precipitates
as nanoparticles.

To control the microwave annealing conditions,
a microwave system was employed (Topwave; output power: 0–1000
W; frequency: 2.45 GHz; Analytik Jena, Germany), which can control
the temperature and measure the pressure in the vessels. The nanoparticle
dispersions were heated up to 90 °C for a time interval of up
to 5 min and then maintained at that temperature for various holding
times (5–60 min). After microwave annealing, the nanoparticle
dispersions were gradually cooled to room temperature. Staining and
preparation of the samples was performed as in the water-annealing
experiments.

4.3 Scanning Transmission Electron
Microscopy
of Nanoparticles
Phase-separated structures in nanoparticles
were observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM,
HD-2000, Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Japan) operated at 200 kV.
To enable the PI segments to be visible in the STEM images, BCP nanoparticles
were stained with OsO4 for several hours. The stained nanoparticles
were then redispersed in water with ultrasonication, and drops of
the dispersion were placed onto Cu grids with elastic carbon membranes
(Okenshoji Co., Ltd., Japan).

4.4 Computational
Details
To integrate eqs 4 and 6, we implement a variation
of the linear implicit scheme discussed
previously in refs (69) and (70). To treat
nonlinearities in these expressions, we split the cubic term into
the product of a quadratic term related to the state of system at
the first time step and a linear term related to the state of the
system at next time step. This scheme is numerically stable and allows
relatively large time steps (Δt ≈ 0.01).
The numerical solution of the coupled system of equations guarantees
the production of morphologies of minimum free energy when the simulation
time is long enough. Likewise, the solution of the Cahn–Hilliard
equations ensures that the total volume (1/|Ω|)∫Ωv0 dx3 remains constant, where v0 is
the initial distribution of the BCP in the whole domain.

We
select appropriate values of the parameters for the model presented
above and then solve the dynamical equations. As a simulation cell,
we use a cubic 128 × 128 × 128 lattice with periodic boundary
conditions in the x-, y-, and z-axes of the lattice box. This size is appropriate for
observing morphologies similar to those found in the experiments.
To represent the three-dimensional morphologies, we plot isosurfaces
taken at appropriate values of the order parameter v.
