The development of biodegradable
packing materials is a global
priority due to the huge volumes of plastic refuse entering landfills
and the environment. In this study, a series of biodegradable nanocomposite
films based on poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)
(PBAT) and reinforced with an organophilic layered double hydroxide
(OLDH) were scale-up fabricated. The OLDH nanosheets with a basal
spacing of 4.07 nm were presynthesized on a large-scale by solvent-free
high-energy ball milling. All of the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite films
(0.5–4 wt % OLDH) showed a uniform dispersion of OLDH nanosheets
in the PBAT matrix. A PBAT/OLDH film containing 1 wt % OLDH (denoted
herein as OLDH-1) demonstrated outstanding thermal, optical, mechanical,
and water vapor barrier properties compared with a pure PBAT film
(OLDH-0), including a 37% reduction in haze and a 41.9% increase in
nominal tensile strain at break dramatically. Furthermore, the food
packaging measurement revealed that the OLDH-1 film showed a better
packaging effect than the pure PBAT film and commercial polyethylene
packing materials. The feasibility of scale-up manufacture and the
excellent processability, manufacturing scalability, mechanical performance,
optical transparency, water vapor barrier properties, and food packaging
performance of the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite films encourage their future
application as biodegradable packaging films.

Introduction
Despite the worldwide
application of the commercial petrochemical-based
packaging materials nowadays, enormous research effort has been devoted
to solve the problem of non-biodegradable food packaging materials,
motivated in large part by increasing the awareness of environmental
problems caused by plastics entering landfills and the wider environment.1−5 Furthermore, the excessively strong barrier ability of these packaging
materials for water can produce local environment with high humidity
when used to pack fruits, giving rise to the possible rapid reproduction
of microorganism and therefore accelerating the aging and spoilage
process. Based on these disadvantages, to develop ecofriendly biodegradable
polymeric packaging materials with appropriate water barrier abilities,
many biodegradable polymers, such as polylactide, poly(propylene carbonate),
and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT),
have been extensively investigated in the context.6−10

Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)
is a aliphatic–aromatic
copolyester thermoplastic that can be blended with other polymeric
materials (e.g., polylactic acid) to produce a broad range of plastic
film materials for different applications.11−14 Although it shows excellent processability,
film-forming property, and biodegradability, the optical, mechanical,
and water vapor barrier properties of PBAT still need to be improved
to match those of the conventional non-biodegradable petrochemical-based
counterparts, such as linear low density polyethylene.15,16 One of the most effective approaches for enhancing the properties
of polymers is to introduce nanofillers at low loadings (typically
<5 wt %).17−19 Recently, montmorillonite or layered silicates have
been added to PBAT to enhance the thermal, mechanical, rheological,
and barrier properties of the polymer.20,21 However, the
ammonium ions in the interlayer space of montmorillonite were easily
degraded or lost during the PBAT composite-manufacturing process,
thereby compromising the integrity and properties of the composite.22 Therefore, the correct choice of filler is important
to achieving improved functionality.

Layered double hydroxides
(LDHs) are layered claylike materials
composed of sheets of positively charged edge-sharing MO6 octahedra with charge-balancing anions and water occupying the interlayer
space between the sheets.23 LDHs have the
general formula [M1–x2+Mx3+(OH)2]q+(An–)q/n·yH2O (where M2+ = Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ or Zn2+; M3+ = Al3+ or Cr3+; and An– are the charge-balancing anions).24,25 Due to their compositional flexibility, LDH find widespread application
in sorption and catalysis.26 However, the
abundance of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the LDH sheets makes
them hydrophilic.27 To obtain better compatibility
with polymer matrix,28 LDH was often modified
by replacing its interlayer anions (typically NO3– or CO32–) with large organic anions
to yield organophilic layered double hydroxides (OLDHs) with a much
lower hydrophilicity. Recently, biodegradable OLDH-containing polymeric
composites have been studied, with good enhancements reported in the
optical, mechanical, and barrier properties resulting from the OLDH
addition.29−31 However, the dominating preparation of OLDH was to
first synthesize the LDH precursor in aqueous solutions and then obtain
the OLDH by organic modification. There are some shortcomings: (1)
low yield, (2) complicated process, (3) solvents use, (4) overlong
reaction time, and (5) high reaction temperature. This limited the
application of this anion-exchange route. Therefore, it is a key point
to scale-up the fabrication of OLDH. High-energy ball milling method,
which is amenable for the large-scale synthesis of LDH materials in
“one pot”, has recently attracted much interest.32,33 The advantages were obvious, such as simple, unheated, solvent-free
preparation process and a large-scale yield. To the best of our knowledge,
the direct large-scale synthesis of OLDH by high-energy ball milling
has a scarce report, although obviously has great potential for practical
applications. Based on the advantages, the large-scale yield of OLDH
made it possible to develop the PBAT/OLDH films as a commercial packaging
application.

The overarching objective of this work was the
scale-up the fabrication
of biodegradable PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite films by the commonly used
melt blending and blowing process.34 The
OLDH-containing organic aliphatic long-chain anion was successfully
synthesized on a large scale by high-energy ball milling method. The
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to verify
the formation of nanosized OLDH. Particular emphasis is placed on
the effect of the OLDH loading (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 wt %, which is
denoted as OLDH-0, OLDH-0.5, OLDH-1, OLDH-2, and OLDH-4) on the structure
and properties (e.g., processability, thermal, optical, mechanical,
water vapor barrier properties, and food packaging performance) of
the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite films as a benchmark of their potential
for commercial packaging applications.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication
and Processability of the PBAT/OLDH Nanocomposite
Films
Intermolecular interactions between the PBAT macromolecular
chains (primarily van der Waals interactions between aromatic–aromatic
and hydrogen bonding of neighboring PBAT molecules) enhance fluid
friction and cause PBAT polymer melts to be viscous,35 resulting in melt blown PBAT films that are sticky and
difficult to separate. In this work, the incorporation of an OLDH
into the PBAT matrix is found to be highly effective in improving
the processability of the polymer. The PBAT/OLDH composites could
be melted and blown into films without any difficulty, whereas the
obtained films display none of the stickiness typical of pure PBAT
films. The improved processability of PBAT/OLDH is attributed to the
lubricating effect of OLDH to reduce chain entanglement and friction
along the molecular chains. As expected, thermal degradation of organic
anion intercalator in OLDH (C12H25PO42–, thermal decomposition temperature: 236 °C)
does not occur during the melt blending and blowing steps used for
composite film fabrication.

Structural and Morphological Characterization
of the OLDH and
the PBAT/OLDH Films
The FT-IR, XRD, TEM, and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) are employed to characterize the structural and morphological
characterization of the OLDH and the PBAT/OLDH films. The FT-IR spectra
for the OLDH powder and PBAT/OLDH films (OLDH-0, OLDH-4) are shown
in Figure 1. For the
OLDH spectra in Figure 1a, the peaks are associated with C–H stretching (2923 and
2585 cm–1), CH2 scissoring (1469 cm–1), P=O and/or P–O stretching (1078 cm–1), and (CH2)n rocking vibrations (719 cm–1)36,37 with C12H25PO42– anions in the interlayer region of OLDH. The strong and broad absorption
peaks at 3445 cm–1 can be attributed to the O–H
stretching modes of the hydroxyl groups on the OLDH sheets and also
the water molecules in the interlayer region.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of (a)
OLDH powder and PBAT/OLDH films: (b) OLDH-0
and (c) OLDH-4.

The FT-IR spectrum of
OLDH-0 in Figure 1b
is similar to that previously reported
for PBAT,38 showing characteristic peaks
at 2901, 1724, 875, 733, and 498 cm–1, which could
readily be assigned to the aliphatic and aromatic C–H stretching,
C=O stretching, C–O stretching, C=C stretching,
and CH2 rocking modes of the polymer. The FT-IR spectrum
of OLDH-4 in Figure 1c contains contributions from both OLDH and PBAT matrices. In particular,
the observation of intense peaks at 2923, 2851, and 1078 cm–1 associated with C12H25PO42– anions in OLDH in the FT-IR spectrum of the composite provides a
strong evidence for the successful incorporation of OLDH nanosheets
into the PBAT matrix.

To further confirm the structural characterization,
XRD was performed
to detect the structure of the OLDH powder and the PBAT/OLDH films
(OLDH-0, OLDH-1, and OLDH-4) in Figure 2. The XRD pattern for the OLDH powder in Figure 2A,a contains peaks at 2θ
= 2.17, 4.70, and 8.45°, which can readily be assigned to the
(003), (006), and (009) reflections of a layered double hydroxide
material with a well-developed layer structure.39 The basal spacing d(003) was 4.07 nm,
similar to that reported for the OLDH obtained from LDH by the anion-exchange
method in our previous work.40 Considering
the alkyl chain length of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
(1.86 nm) and the thickness of metal hydroxide layer (0.47 nm) in
the LDH sheets, it can be concluded the MAPK anion chains are arranged
in a bilayer (two molecules thick) between the metal hydroxide sheets,
as shown in Figure 3a.

Figure 2 (A) X-ray diffraction patterns for (a) OLDH powder and PBAT/OLDH
films: (b) OLDH-0, (c) OLDH-1, and (d) OLDH-4 in the 2θ range

interlayer region. (b) TEM images and size distribution of the OLDH.

The XRD patterns for a selection
of PBAT/OLDH composite films (OLDH-0,
OLDH-1, and OLDH-4 containing 0, 1, and 4 wt % OLDH, respectively),
are shown in Figure 2A,b–d. The XRD data for all three films are identical. The
characteristic (003), (006), and (009) reflections of OLDH cannot
be discerned in the XRD patterns of OLDH-1 and OLDH-4, which can be
attributed to the very low OLDH loadings in the films or possibly
partial delamination of the metal hydroxide sheets of OLDH in the
PBAT matrix. Crystalline reflections associated with the PBAT matrix
are observed at higher 2θ angles of 22.86, 34.47, and 48.16°
in Figure 2B,a–c.
The XRD data for OLDH-0, OLDH-1, and OLDH-4 in this region are identical,
confirming that the OLDH addition at loadings up to 4 wt % have no
adverse effect on the crystalline structure or crystallinity of PBAT
films.

The TEM and SEM analyses are performed to confirm the
morphological
characterization of the OLDH and the PBAT/OLDH composite films. The
TEM image and size distribution of OLDH reveals that the OLDH is in
nanoscale, with size distribution 100–200 nm in Figure 3b. The SEM micrographs of the
fracture surface of OLDH-0, OLDH-1, and OLDH-4 are shown in Figure 4. The fracture surface
of OLDH-0 is smooth, showing no pores (Figure 4a,A). The SEM images for OLDH-1 are very
similar to those collected for OLDH-0 (Figure 4b,B). OLDH-4 shows a very uniform dispersion
of small OLDH nanoparticles (signed by red arrows) in the PBAT matrix
(Figure 4c,C), an evidence
for good compatibility between the two composite components. It should
be noted that OLDH-4 also contains a number of small pores, which
likely result from the release of water from the OLDH interlayer region
during the composite-manufacturing process.41 This would explain why the amount of pores in the films increased
with the OLDH content.

films:
(a, A) OLDH-0, (b, B) OLDH-1, and (c, C) OLDH-4, where (a)–(c)
are the images in transverse direction and (A)–(C) in the machine
direction, respectively.

Thermal Analysis of PBAT/OLDH Films
To study the thermal
stability of a selection of PBAT/OLDH films (OLDH-0, OLDH-1, and OLDH-4),
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is employed to analyze the
crystallization and melting behavior. The cooling and heating curves
are presented in Figure 5A,B, respectively. OLDH-0 shows a crystallization temperature (Tc) of 82.28 °C on cooling from the melt
(Figure 5A). The crystallization
temperature for OLDH-1 is higher (84.02 °C) than that of OLDH-0,
which is explained by the heterogeneous nucleation caused by the presence
of the OLDH platelets, which promote polymer crystallite growth, in
the PBAT matrix.42 However, the higher
loadings of OLDH in the PBAT/OLDH composites lowers the Tc (e.g., OLDH-4, Tc 81.21
°C), suggesting that excessive amounts of OLDH can interfere
with the crystallization of PBAT. This result is not surprising because
polymer crystallization requires parallel alignment of the polymer
chains and the formation of lamellae, processes that will be kinetically
hindered by excessive amounts of impurities (i.e., too many OLDH nanosheets).
In contrast, the melting temperatures (Tm) of the PBAT/OLDH films (OLDH-1 and OLDH-4) are almost identical
to that of pure PBAT (i.e., OLDH-0), as shown in Figure 5B. However, the melting curves
become progressively broader with increasing OLDH content, suggesting
some minor influence of the OLDH nanosheets on the melting properties
of the composite films.

films: OLDH-0, OLDH-1, and OLDH-4.

Optical Properties of the PBAT/OLDH Films
Visible light
transmittance and haze are key properties for packaging films, with
a high transmittance and low haze being desirable. A detailed investigation
of the PBAT/OLDH films is thus undertaken. Figure 6 shows that the visible light transmittance
of the PBAT/OLDH films improve with the OLDH content up to 1 wt %,
and then decreases sharply at higher OLDH loadings. The haze decreases
with OLDH addition up to 1 wt % and then increases again at higher
loadings. The OLDH-1 film thus display the best optical properties
among the films tested, showing a 5% higher optical transmittance
and a 37% lower haze than the pristine PBAT film. This can be attributed
to an increase in the nucleation sites in the polymer-crystallizing
process and the amorphous form of PBAT matrix induced by the heterogeneous
nucleation effect of the OLDH nanosheets, which is also supported
by the DSC data in Figure 5A. The progressive deterioration of the optical properties
of the films at higher OLDH loadings (i.e., above 1 wt %) can be attributed
to the scattering effects caused by the development of small pores
(cf. Figure 4c,C).
The superior optical property of the OLDH-1 film compared to the OLDH-0
(pristine PBAT film) is visibly evident from the digital photographs
shown in Figure 6.

light transmittance and haze curves of PBAT/OLDH films:
OLDH-0, OLDH-0.5, OLDH-1, OLDH-2, and OLDH-4.

Mechanical Properties of PBAT/OLDH Films
The mechanical
properties of the PBAT/OLDH films are evaluated in the transverse
direction and machine direction, with results presented in Figure 7A,B, respectively.
The data show that the nominal tensile strain at break and the tensile
strength of the PBAT/OLDH films in both the transverse and machine
directions increase with OLDH loading up to an optimum OLDH loading
of ∼1 wt %. In particular, OLDH-1 shows a 41.9% improvement
in the nominal tensile strain at break in the machine direction compared
with OLDH-0 (PBAT with no OLDH added). It can be concluded that the
OLDH addition at low loadings leads to significant enhancement in
the tensile properties of the PBAT/OLDH films, especially the nominal
tensile strain at break in the machine direction. At high OLDH loadings
(>1 wt %), the intermolecular interactions between PBAT molecular
chains are interrupted by the abundance of OLDH nanosheets and pores
in the polymer matrix, weakening the mechanical strength of the films.

Figure 7 Tensile
properties of PBAT/OLDH films: OLDH-0, OLDH-0.5, OLDH-1,
OLDH-2, and OLDH-4 in (A) transverse direction and (B) machine direction.

The enhancement of the tensile
properties of PBAT with OLDH addition
at low loadings warrants further discussion. PBAT is a flexible polymer,
whereas the OLDH particles are rigid fillers. Therefore, the increase
in the tensile strength and the nominal tensile strain at break for
OLDH-1 is likely related to the high aspect ratio of the OLDH nanosheets
and their homogeneous dispersion within the PBAT matrix.43,44 The enhancement in the mechanical properties in the machine direction
in the nanocomposite hybrids likely results from a uniform alignment
of the OLDH nanosheets in the plane of the PBAT films caused by the
shear stress during the film manufacture, and also the excellent interfacial
contact of the PBAT chains with the OLDH nanosheets.45

Water Vapor Barrier Properties of PBAT/OLDH
Films
The
water vapor transmission properties of the PBAT/OLDH films are investigated
to evaluate the effect of the OLDH content on the water vapor barrier
properties of the films. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR)
of each sample is calculated according to the following eq 1 1  where Δm (g) is the
mass of water vapor passing through the sample film; A (m2) is the area of each film; and t (h) is the measured time interval. As shown in Figure 8, the addition of OLDH decreases
the WVTR of PBAT markedly. The WVTR decreases by 11.6 and 14.3% for
OLDH-1 and OLDH-2, respectively, compared with OLDH-0. This can be
explained by the presence of the OLDH nanoparticles in the film, creating
a longer diffusion path for water molecules to pass through the film.
It is probable that the OLDH nanosheets are delaminated to some extent
in the films, giving an abundance of two-dimensional nanoplatelets
with a uniform dispersion throughout the PBAT matrix, further extending
the path taken by water molecules in traversing the PBAT/OLDH films.46 This is depicted schematically in Figure 8. The improvement in the water
vapor barrier properties of PBAT on OLDH addition at low loadings
is of great importance in the food packaging field.

films: OLDH-0, OLDH-0.5, OLDH-1, OLDH-2,

Food Packaging Experiment
Banana is a delicious and
worldwide fruit containing abundant vitamin B and mineral substances.
However, the easy aging and spoilage has made the storage of banana
a hot topic. At present, the common strategy to store banana are packaging
with petrochemical-based polymer films. The ideal packaging materials
can prevent the spoilage and keep the freshness of fruit. However,
the local environment with high humidity (Figure S1) produced by the excessively strong water barrier ability
of the present commercial packaging materials will accelerate the
aging and spoilage process of banana. Among the extensively recognized
ecofriendly polymers, PBAT with appropriate water barrier ability
compared with those of petrochemical-based polymer, make it possible
as a better packaging material to store fruits. Therefore, we select
PBAT as the test object to solve the easy spoilage of banana.

In our work, the food packaging experiment of the pure PBAT film
and PBAT/OLDH films with enhanced water barrier ability are taken
to evaluate the feasibility as a food packaging film.47 Considering that the OLDH-1 film demonstrates outstanding
thermal, optical, mechanical, and water vapor barrier properties compared
with other PBAT/OLDH films (OLDH-0.5, OLDH-2, and OLDH-4) and pure
PBAT film (OLDH-0), we chose the OLDH-1 film and pure PBAT film as
experimental subject. The result is significantly obvious. As shown
in Figure 9, the banana
sample packaged with OLDH-1 film demonstrates the optimal color and
luster than that packaged with pure PBAT film and exposed to air after
14 days. This reveals that the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite film containing
1% OLDH shows a better packaging effect than other PBAT films, which
is contributed by the better watertightness of the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite
film. Furthermore, the contrastive banana packaging experiment (Figure S2) reveals that the banana packed with
PBAT/OLDH film had better color and luster than that packed with commercial
polyethylene film after 14 days. Interestingly, the obvious accumulation
of water released by banana itself and the white bacterial colony
of banana packed by polyethylene film (Figure S2) after 56 days can further verify the excessively strong
water barrier ability of the present commercial packaging materials,
which can easily result in the spoilage of bananas. The results encourage
the future food packaging application of biodegradable PBAT/OLDH film.

Conclusions
A
series of biodegradable nanocomposite films based on poly(butylene
adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and an organophilic
layered double hydroxide (OLDH) were fabricated at industrial level
using a melt blending and blowing method. High-energy ball milling
was used to synthesize an OLDH, yielding a pure product in a high
yield, with large alkyl phosphonate anions in the interlayer region.
The data collected using a variety of techniques demonstrated that
OLDH addition at a loading of ∼1 wt % could significantly enhance
the optical and mechanical properties of PBAT, whereas also improving
the general processability of the PBAT-based films. The SEM investigations
confirmed a very uniform distribution of the OLDH particles throughout
the PBAT/OLDH films, with the partial delamination of the OLDH layers
during processing thought to be responsible for the enhanced optical
(37% reduction in haze) and mechanical performance (41.9% increase
in the nominal tensile strain at break in machine direction) compared
to pure PBAT films. The OLDH nanoplatelets also enhanced the water
vapor barrier properties of the PBAT films by creating a physical
obstacle and thus a longer migration path for water molecules. The
food packaging measurement revealed that the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite
film containing 1% OLDH showed a better packaging effect than pure
PBAT film and commercial polyethylene packing materials. These results
suggest that OLDH addition to create polymer–OLDH nanocomposites
is a viable approach for enhancing the properties of biodegradable
polymer films for food packaging application.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (trade
name: Biocosafe 2003) with melt flow index
4.2 g (10 min)−1 (190 °C, 2.16 kg) was supplied
by Xinfu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). Al(NO3)3·9H2O (AR, 99%), Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (AR, 99%), and NaOH (AR, 99%) were purchased
from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Lauryl alcohol phosphoric
acid ester potassium (MAPK) (AR, 97%) was obtained from Lihou Chemical
Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). All of the reagents were analytical
grade and used as received. Deionized water was used in all of the
experiments.

Synthesis of ZnAl-MAPK OLDH
The
organophilic ZnAl-MAPK
OLDH was directly synthesized by solvent-free high-energy ball milling
using a QM-3SP2 planetary ball mill. A mixture of MAPK (51.3 g, 0.15
mol) and NaOH (19.2 g, 0.48 mol) was premilled for 30 min, followed
by addition of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O
(53.5 g, 0.18 mol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (22.5 g, 0.06 mol) and milling for a further 30 min. Four
agate pots (inner volume: 500 cm3) and many agate balls
(diameter: 6 mm; quantity: 2000; diameter: 10 mm; quantity: 400) were
used in a single milling process. The total volume of reactants and
agate balls was approximately three-fourths that of the agate pots.
The revolution speed and autorotation rate were fixed at 250 and 500
rpm, respectively. After ball milling, the product slurry was washed
three times with deionized water and then dried at 70 °C to obtain
white ZnAl-MAPK OLDH powders (yield 180 g). The OLDH powders were
ground in a mortar and pestle and then passed through an 800 mesh
(0.015 mm) sieve before subsequent use in composite manufacture. The
ZnAl-MAPK OLDH powder is simply denoted as OLDH in the text below.

Manufacture of PBAT/OLDH Nanocomposite Films
The PBAT/OLDH
nanocomposite films were manufactured by melt blending and blowing
process. First, PBAT and OLDH were mixed using a SHR-10A high-speed
mixer at a rotary speed of 60 rpm for 10 min, and then the resulting
mixture was fed into a SHJ135 co-rotating twin-screw extruder operating
at a screw speed of 120 rpm with a temperature difference between
the feed and die zones of 120–145 °C. The extruded PBAT/OLDH
nanocomposite granulates were subsequently melted and blown into films
using a SGXM-1800 single-screw film blowing machine operating at 40
rpm and temperatures of 110, 120, 125, and 130 °C along the four
barrel zones. The manufacturing process of the PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite
films is summarized in Scheme 1. The mass ratios of PBAT and OLDH were 100/0, 99.5/0.5, 99/1,
98/2, and 96/4, respectively, with the corresponding PBAT/OLDH nanocomposite
films abbreviated as OLDH-0, OLDH-0.5, OLDH-1, OLDH-2, and OLDH-4
in the text below. For each film, the total mass of PBAT and OLDH
was constant (4 kg) and the film thickness controlled at 50 ±
1 μm. The film samples were stored in a desiccator at room temperature
before characterization tests.

Nanocomposite Films
Characterization
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Thermo
Nicolet 380 spectrometer using the KBr disk method over the range
of 4000–400 cm–1. Thirty two consecutive
scans collected at a resolution of 4 cm–1 were co-added
to produce a spectrum. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained
on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, equipped with a Cu Kα
source (λ = 1.54056 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. Data
were collected over the 2θ range 1–60°, with a step
of 0.02° and a scan speed of 4° min–1.
The sample morphologies were examined using an H-800 transmission
electron microscope and a JEOL JSM-6380LV scanning electron microscope.
The SEM analyses were performed on freeze-fractured PBAT/OLDH films,
which were immersed in liquid nitrogen and then fractured. The fractured
surfaces were then sputtered coated with gold to improve their conductivity
for imaging. The melting and crystallization behavior of the PBAT/OLDH
films were investigated using a Netzsch DSC 200PC differential scanning
calorimeter under a nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate of 50 mL min–1). The PBAT/OLDH film samples (8–10 mg) were
heated from ambient temperature to 200 °C at 10 °C min–1 and then held at 200 °C for 3 min to erase the
thermal history, after which they were cooled to 0 °C at 10 °C
min–1 to study the crystallization behavior and
finally reheated to 200 °C at 10 °C min–1 to study their melting behavior. The optical properties of the PBAT/OLDH
films were examined using an INESA WGT-2S light transmittance/haze
tester using GB 2410-2008. Optical photographs of the films were taken
with a Canon EOS-700d digital camera. The tensile tests on the PBAT/OLDH
films were conducted at ambient temperature using a SUNS UTM2502 electronic
universal testing machine. The crosshead speed was set at 200 mm min–1. The sample films were cut into dumbbell-shaped pieces
according to the GB/T 1040.3-2006 standard. Five specimens of each
PBAT/OLDH films were measured and the average reported. The water
vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of the PBAT/OLDH films was determined
using a PERME W3/030 automatic water vapor transmission tester. The
experiments were conducted at a temperature of 23 °C under 57%
relative humidity conditions according to the GB 1037-88 standard.
Before the measurements, the films were placed in a vacuum drying
oven at 60 °C for 12 h to remove the moisture. The films were
cut into circles of diameter 0.074 m for the measurements. Three specimens
of each PBAT/OLDH film were measured and the average value reported.
