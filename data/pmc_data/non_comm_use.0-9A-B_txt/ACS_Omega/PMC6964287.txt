A peptide corresponding to bacteriorhodopsin (bR) helix
C, later
named pHLIP, inserts across lipid bilayers as a monomeric α-helix
at acidic pH, but is an unstructured surface-bound monomer at neutral
pH. As a result of such pH-responsiveness, pHLIP targets acidic tumors
and has been used as a vehicle for imaging and drug-delivery cargoes.
To gain insights about the insertion of bR helix C into biological
membranes, we replaced two key aspartic residues that control the
topological transition from the aqueous phase into a lipid bilayer.
Here, we used an in vitro transcription–translation
system to study the translocon-mediated insertion of helix C-derived
segments into rough microsomes. Our data provide the first quantitative
biological understanding of this effect. Interestingly, replacing
the aspartic residues by glutamic residues does not significantly
alters the insertion propensity, while replacement by alanines promotes
a transmembrane orientation. These results are consistent with mutational
data obtained in synthetic liposomes by manipulating pH conditions.
Our findings support the notion that the translocon facilitates topogenesis
under physiological pH conditions.

Introduction
Most membrane proteins comprise a series
of membrane-spanning hydrophobic
helices separated by polar loops of different lengths. The orientation
of the TM helices with respect to the bilayer plane defines the topology
of the membrane protein.1,2 The translocon participates
in the genesis of membrane protein topology. However, membrane topology
is believed to be ultimately determined by the interplay between the
physical properties of protein and lipid molecules. The path followed
by many simple membrane proteins to acquire their final topology can
be satisfactorily conceptualized within the framework of the two-stage
model.3 This model postulates that independent
helices that completely span the membrane assembly to acquire the
final three-dimensional structure. More complex membrane proteins,
however, can adopt more intricate mechanisms frequently due to the
presence of poorly hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments.4−9

The helix C of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a poorly hydrophobic
TM
domain, and the pH-dependent membrane interaction of this sequence
inspired its use as a tumor-targeting peptide, dubbed as pHLIP (pH-Low
Insertion Peptide).10,11 Helix C of bR contains several
charged residues including two key aspartic residues (D85 and D96,
see Figure 1) that
participate in the proton permeation pathway.12 The hydrophobicity of pHLIP varies with the protonation of these
groups, and so it depends on the pH of the environment.13 As a result, pHLIP exhibits at least two different
types of membrane interaction. At neutral pH, the side chains of the
acidic residues are negatively charged, decreasing the overall hydrophobicity
of the peptide. At this pH, the peptide is water-soluble while it
can bind to the membrane surface, with a low α-helical content
that is modulated by the physical properties of the lipid bilayer
and ionic conditions.14,15 On the other hand, at low pH,
the acidic residues lose their negative charge with pK values near 6.16 The protonation of acidic
side chains increases the hydrophobicity of the peptide, causing insertion
across the lipid bilayer and establishment of a TM helix.11,17 Since pHLIP is marginally hydrophobic, and the topology can be controlled
by the pH, this peptide has been used as a model system for studying
membrane topological transitions of poorly hydrophobic TM segments.
Here, we investigated the membrane insertion of helix C variants relevant
to understand the transitions previously observed for pHLIP using
an experimental system18−21 that allows accurate measurements of the apparent free energy (ΔGapp) of translocon-mediated insertion of TM
helices into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which arguably
is a more complex environment and measurement than those provided
by other experimental assays based on model membranes.

(helix C) studied in this work are shown in yellow (from Trp80 to

shown by the horizontal dotted lines 35.5 Å apart. Aspartic 85
and 96 side chains are shown in sticks representation (red), giving
distances between the carboxylic side chains and the interface of
about 14.8 and 4.4 Å, respectively. Protein representation was

Results and Discussion
We determined the translocon-mediated
insertion propensity of bR
helix C variants into the ER membrane using a microsomal translocation
assay.18,21 We worked with the wild-type (Wt) sequence
and multiple variants of the residues that control the topological
transition, D85 and D96. To this end, peptide sequences derived from
Wt bR helix C were independently introduced into the large luminal
P2 domain of the model protein leader peptidase (Lep) from Escherichia coli. The inserted sequences were limited
to the putative TM region (Figure 2A top, residues W80-V101, Halobacterium
salinarum bR, pdbID 1PY6(22)) and were
flanked by GGPG- and -GPGG tetrapeptides at both N- and C-termini
to ‘insulate’ the tested sequences from the Lep carrier
protein.18 Glycosylation sites were placed
at both ends of the tested sequences to permit quantification of the
insertion propensity. The different constructs were then expressed
in vitro in the presence of ER-derived column-washed canine pancreas
rough microsomes and radiolabeled amino acids. Because glycosylation
takes place only in the interior (lumen) of the microsome, membrane-inserted
sequences are monoglycosylated, whilst noninserted (translocated)
sequences are double glycosylated (Figure 2A). Quantification of the fractions of monoglycosylated
(f1g) and double glycosylated (f2g) molecules allows calculating the apparent
equilibrium constant, Kapp, for the membrane
insertion of a given sequence tested, Kapp = f1g/f2g. The Kapp value can be converted into
the apparent free energy difference between the inserted and the noninserted
state.6 We determined the membrane insertion
efficiency by phosphorimager scans of SDS-PAGE gels that measure the
fractions of mono (f1g) and double (f2g) glycosylated proteins. As shown in Figure 2B, translation–glycosylation
results reveal that helix C wild-type sequence does not insert efficiently
(15.9% singly glycosylated, Table 1) into the biological membranes (Figure 2B, lanes 1–2). This result is in agreement
with previous biophysical data,10 obtained
with peptides assayed at neutral pH, expected to be similar to pH
found in the microsomal environment. Replacement of Asp85 and Asp96
both independently and at the same time to glutamic residues do not
alter significantly the insertion efficiency (Figure 2B, lanes 4–5, 10–11, and 19–20),
although a slightly higher insertion efficiency was consistently observed
for D96E mutant when compared to D85E (compare lanes 5 and 11 in Figure 2B; see also Table 1) in agreement to
recent biophysical data.23

Figure 2 Translocon-mediated insertion
of bR helix C variants into microsomal
membranes using Lep as a model protein. (A) The bR helix C wild-type
sequence (residues W80-V101, yellow box) flanked by the insulating
tetrapeptides (italics) is shown on top (acidic and basic residues
are shown in red and blue, respectively). Schematic representation
of the Lep constructs. The tested sequence under investigation (colored)
was introduced into the C-terminal P2 domain of Lep, flanked by two
designed glycosylation acceptor sites (G1 and G2). Recognition of
the tested sequence as a TM domain by the translocon machinery results
in the modification of only the G1 acceptor site located in the luminal
side of the microsome, preventing G2 glycosylation (left). The Lep
chimera will be doubly glycosylated when the sequence being tested
is translocated into the lumen of the microsomes (right). (B) In vitro
translation in the presence of column-washed rough microsomes (CRMs)
of the different Lep constructs. Constructs containing bR helix C
Wt (residues 80–101; lanes 1–3), D85E variant (lanes
4 to 6), D96A variant (lanes 7–9), D96E variant (lanes 10–12),
D96A variant (lanes 13–15), and double mutants D85/96A and
D85/96E variants (lanes 16–18 and 19–21, respectively)
were translated in the presence (+) and absence (−) of CRMs
and proteinase K (PK). Bands of nonglycosylated proteins are indicated
by a white dot; mono and double glycosylated proteins are indicated
by one and two black dots, respectively. The protected doubly glycosylated
H2/helix C/P2 fragments are indicated by an arrowhead. Each gel is
representative of at least three independent experiments.

Table 1 Apparent Free Energy Difference (ΔGapp) and Insertion Percentage (InsExp) Calculated for bR Helix C Variantsa
a Prediction of ΔG for membrane insertion (ΔGapppred) was based on the ΔG prediction
server (http://dgpred.cbr.su.se/), and experimentally determined values (ΔGappexp) were obtained from the in vitro glycosylation
assay (in kcal/mol). The normalization of glycosylation data was calculated
as done previously.18,19 A negative value (shown in green)
of ΔGapp indicates that the sequence
is integrated into the membrane, a positive value (shown in red) of
ΔGapp is indicates a non-TM disposition.
The percentage of molecules inserted in the membrane is given in the
right column (average and standard deviation of at least three independent
experiments).

Alanine replacement increased the insertion propensity
for D85A,
D96A, and D85/96A variants (Figure 2B, lanes 7–8, 13–14, and 16–17,
respectively). These results were confirmed by proteinase K (PK) treatment.
Digestion with PK degrades membrane protein regions located exclusively
outside the microsome, while lumenally exposed or membrane-embedded
domains are protected. As expected, Lep chimeras harboring Wt, D85E,
D85A, D96E, D96A, and D85/96E sequences were partially resistant to
protease treatment due to the luminal location of the large C-terminal
P2 domain (Figure 2B, lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, arrowhead). However, Lep constructs
harboring the D85/96A variant was totally sensitive to PK digestion
(Figure 2B, lane 18).
Although alanine is the second most prevalent residue in transmembrane
helices,24 it is poised on the threshold
between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the translocon-mediated
assay.18,25 Thus, the higher insertion efficiency observed
for this later sequence is probably due to the absence of the aspartic
(or glutamic) acidic side-chain, more than to the presence of the
methyl side-chain groups of the two alanine residues. The distribution
of aspartic residues along the hydrophobic core of the membrane is
thermodynamically complicated by the fact that the free energy for
changing their ionization state may outweigh the free energy cost
of burying a charge in the membrane. Molecular dynamics simulations
have suggested that both large water defects26 as well as explicit inclusion of protein helices mimicking biological
membrane composition,27 support the partition
of charged residues into the hydrocarbon core.

The transfer
of charged amino acids into the low dielectric environment
of the membrane core is energetically unfavorable.28 The ensuing loss in the conformational stability of membrane
proteins is frequently compensated by gains in functional capabilities,
such as catalytic or transport activities and binding of cofactors.
Furthermore, charged residues can form intramembranous salt bridges
that provide specificity and stability for the lateral association
between transmembrane helices.5,20,29,30 We speculate that acidic residue
protonation might significantly contribute to TM insertion and can
take place at the translocon environment. A recent solid-state NMR
study determined the individual membrane pKa values for the aspartate residues studied in this work.16 It was found that protonation occurs at pKa values of 5.82 ± 0.08 (Asp85) and 6.08
± 0.08 (Asp96). Such values are much higher than the typical
value for aspartate in solution (pKa ∼416,31,32). The higher pKa values likely result from dehydration
at the bilayer integration stage, leading to a decrease in the local
dielectric constant.33 In fact, London
and co-workers have studied polyleucine peptides containing a single
aspartic acid at the TM domain, also finding that they exhibited pKa values ranging between 5.6 and 6.7, with higher
values found for the more deeply buried aspartic acids.34 Although a pure membrane-mimetic system might
be a convenient depiction for many membrane properties, it might have
thoughtful shortcomings, in particular, for describing the insertion
of charged residues using peptide-based assays. Previous simulations
of models mimicking biological membranes suggested that the actual
insertion cost for a particularly charged residue appears to depend
significantly on protein contents and on the presence of the translocon
itself in the simulated membranes.27 Whether
the protonation of the aspartate residues occurs once the TM segment
is located within the translocon35 or even
at an earlier stage inside the ribosome exit tunnel as recently reported
for TM helix formation36 is still to be
determined.

Our glycosylation results in microsomes agree with
previous data
obtained in reconstituted systems, where pHLIP was added to the exterior
of liposomes.37 When conditions were selected
to avoid pHLIP aggregation, by working at low micromolar concentrations,
pHLIP spontaneously (and reversibly) inserted into the bilayer upon
a pH drop. The careful selection of experimental conditions might
play a similar role than the presence of the translocon: to prevent
aggregation and misfolding events. Whether or not the different lipid
composition in each endomembrane compartment within the cell has a
role in this process is still an open question. Our data support that
the large body of kinetic and thermodynamic information obtained in
such reconstituted systems might be biologically relevant, and paved
the way to study further pHLIP variants with potential biomedical
applications.38 However, our findings pointed
out that the TM disposition of helices in the folded structure (Figure 1) do not always correspond
to the efficient insertion of the corresponding isolated helices into
biological membranes. Beyond the conceptual framework involving the
mechanism of membrane insertion, the availability of quantitative
experimental data on the contribution of aspartic residues to ΔGapp can facilitate the refinement of membrane
protein insertion39 and folding40 prediction methods based on free-energy calculations.

Experimental Section
Enzymes and Chemicals
All enzymes used in this work,
as well as a pGEM1-derived plasmid, TNT T7 Quick Coupled System and
rabbit reticulocyte lysate, were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).
ER-derived rough microsomes from canine pancreas were obtained from
tRNA Probes (College Station, TX). EasyTag EXPRESS35S Protein
Labeling Mix (containing [35S]-l-methionine and
[35S]-l-cysteine) for in vitro radioactive labeling
was purchased from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA). Proteinase K was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Restriction enzymes used for DNA
manipulation were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Basel,
Switzerland). The DNA plasmid, RNA clean up, and PCR purification
kits were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Ulm, Germany). All oligonucleotides
were purchased from Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea).

DNA Manipulation
Oligonucleotides encoding the pHLIP
variants were introduced into the P2 domain (between residues 226
and 253) of E. coli leader peptidase
(Lep). Glycosylation acceptor sites (G1 and G2) were placed in positions
96–98 (Asn-Ser-Thr) and 277–279 (Asn-Ser-Thr), flanking
the tested sequences. Pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (25
μM) encoding bR helix C sequence (residues 80 to 101) were initially
annealed at 85 °C for 10 min in annealing buffer (20 m Tris-HCl,
20 mM MgCl2, 500 mM NaCl) followed by slow cooling to 30
°C. Subsequently, the two-annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides
were mixed, incubated for 5 min at 65 °C, cooled down slowly
to room temperature, purified, and treated with polynucleotide kinase
for 30 min at 37 °C. The annealed oligonucleotides were ligated
overnight with T4 DNA ligase (Promega) at 16 °C into purified
pGEM-Lep plasmid digested with SpeI/KpnI restriction
enzymes and treated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega).20 All bR helix C variants were obtained by site-directed
mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, California).
All helix C-derived inserts were confirmed by sequencing the plasmid
DNA at Macrogen Company (Seoul, South Korea)

Translocon-Mediated Insertion into Microsomal Membranes
Variants in pGEM1 were transcribed and translated in one step using
the TNT SP6 Quick Coupled System (Promega, USA). The reaction mixtures
contained 75 ng of DNA template, 0.5 μL of EasyTag (5 μCi), and 0.25 μL of column-washed canine microsomes (tRNA
Probes, USA) and were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Translation
products were subsequently ultracentrifuged (100 000g for 15 min) on a sucrose cushion and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
The protein bands were quantified using a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphoimager
and Image Reader 8.1j software. As mentioned above, the membrane-insertion
probability for a given pHLIP-derived segment was calculated as the
quotient of the intensity of the double glycosylated band divided
by the summed intensities of the singly glycosylated and doubly glycosylated
bands. For the proteinase K (PK) protection assay, 2 μL of proteinase
K (2 mg/mL) was added to the sample, and the digestion reaction was
incubated for 15 min on ice. Before SDS-PAGE analysis, the reaction
was stopped by adding 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride.41

Normalization of Glycosylation Data
The fraction f′2g = C2g/(C1g + C2g) (where C is the pixel-count for the band in question)
of doubly glycosylated molecules varies from 0 for tested segments
that are fully integrated with a transmembrane disposition within
the microsomal membrane, to 0.86 for H-segments that are fully translocated
across the membrane, reflecting the fact that a lumenally exposed
glycosylation site is only modified in ∼ 95% of the molecules.
To correct this, the values used in the calculation of ΔGapp were normalized as in18
