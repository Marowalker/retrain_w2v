Many
chemical and physical equilibrium conditions can be determined
from minimizing the Gibbs free energies of the system. Efficient analytical
representations of the entropy and Gibbs free energy of carbonyl sulfide
remain elusive in the communality of science and engineering. Here,
we report two analytical representations of the entropy and Gibbs
free energy for carbonyl sulfide, and the prediction procedures only
involve six molecular constants of the carbonyl sulfide molecule.
In the temperature range from 300 to 6000 K, the average relative
deviations of the predicted molar entropy and reduced Gibbs free energy
values of carbonyl sulfide from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology database are arrived at 0.150 and 0.189%, respectively.

1 Introduction
Carbonyl sulfide (COS
or OCS, hereafter COS) is a colorless and
toxic organic sulfur compound, which widely exists in natural gas,
petroleum gas, water gas, and semiwater gas.1−8 COS also originates from the volcanic activity9 and biomass burning.10,11 COS passes through
the same diffusion pathway into the leaf chloroplasts as carbon dioxide
(CO2) and is consumed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.12−18 Plants do not produce COC, and plant leaves directly consume COS.
Observations of COS have appeared as an efficient tool for understanding
terrestrial carbon uptake and plant physiology. As natural gas has
economic and ecological advantages, this leads it to become more attractive
for many countries. In order to transport natural gas and utilize
commercially, it is usually necessary to remove acid gases, including
CO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and impurities
such as COS and mercaptans. Emission of toxic COS without treatment
in coal gas, biogas, tail gas, and other industrial gas will yield
air pollution and can also lead to equipment corrosion and poisoning
the catalysts. Therefore, the industry has developed strict specifications
for the transportation and utilization of sulfur compounds, limiting
the total content of sulfur to 35–50 ppm. To prevent equipment
damage and catalyst empoisoning in various processes such as methane
reforming and oil refining, the efficient removal of COS can be achieved
by adsorption using aqueous solutions of various alkanolamines.19 The removal of COS and reducing its emission
have aroused much attention.19−30 The knowledge of Gibbs free energy plays an important role for understanding
adsorbate–adsorbent interactions. A higher negative value of
the change in the Gibbs free energy implies a more energetically favorable
adsorption process. The accurate prediction of the Gibbs free energy
change in an adsorption process is useful for the design and fabrication
of suitable adsorbents.

In order to carry out optimization of
COS recovery and emissions,
one requires accurate and reliable thermochemical property data on
COS.31−35 An accurate and efficient analytical representation of the Gibbs
free energy for COS can afford direct and rapid pathways to determine
the change in Gibbs free energy and minimization of Gibbs free energy
for a system containing COS. However, obtaining efficient analytical
representations of the entropy and Gibbs free energy for COS remains
a perennial challenging task in science and engineering community.
Based on the effective descriptions of molecular internal vibrations
in terms of several improved oscillators, including the improved Tietz
oscillator, improved Manning–Rosen oscillator, and Rosen–Morse
oscillator, some authors have successfully predicted thermochemical
properties of some gaseous diatomic substances.36−52 In the previous work,53 our group investigated
two analytical representations of the entropy and Gibbs free energy
of carbon dioxide (CO2) which is a triatomic linear symmetric
molecule. Here, we further extend our treatment approach proposed
in ref (53) to the
triatomic linear nonsymmetric molecule COS. Span and Wagner54 suggested that all the thermodynamic properties
of a pure substance can be obtained by combining the Helmholtz free
energy and its derivatives. Although Lemmon and Span55 proposed an empirical analytical representation for the
ideal-gas part of the Helmholtz free energy of COS, it contains 13
adjustable coefficients which were determined by fitting many experimental
data points. Here, we report two efficient analytical representations
to our knowledge of the molar entropy and Gibbs free energy of COS
from the first principles. To check the effectiveness of the proposed
prediction models, a comparison of the predicted values with the available
data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
database56 is also performed.

2 Results and Discussion
In order to test the proposed models,
calculations of the molar
entropy and reduced Gibbs free energy are performed and compared to
available data from the NIST data,56 where
six molecular constants of the COS molecule are collected from the
work made by Lochte-Holtgreven et al.,57 and Robinson58 and Tubergen et al.:59De = 76 kcal/mol–1, reCO = 1.16 Å, reCS = 1.56 Å, ωes = 859
cm–1, ωea = 2062 cm–1, and ωeb = 521 cm–1. The reduced
Gibbs free energy is represented as Gr = −(G – H298.15)/T; here, H298.15 denotes
the molar enthalpy value of COS at 298.15 K. The molar Gibbs free
energy determined from expression 14 for COS
is −34 825.05 J·mol–1 at 298
K. The NIST value of reduced molar Gibbs free energy is 231.6 J·mol–1·K–1 at 298 K.56 By the aid of these two Gibbs free energy values, the molar
enthalpy value of COS is determined as 34 191.75 J·mol–1 at 298.15 K. The calculated entropy and reduced Gibbs
free energy values of COS from expressions 13 and 14, in the temperature range of 300–6000
K at the pressure of 1 bar, are presented in Figure 1, in which the NIST data56 are also depicted. The predicted values agree with less
than 0.150 and 0.189% average relative deviations, respectively, with
the NIST data. These deviation values tell us that the proposed models
behave very well in reproducing the entropy and Gibbs free energy
values of COS. The NIST data are taken from the NIST-JANAF Thermochemical
Tables compiled by Chase.60 The values
in the NIST-JANAF Tables are determined by using plenty of theoretical
or experimental spectroscopic constants. In the future, we will expand
the applications of the proposed prediction models under the conditions
of different pressures.

of COS for
(A) molar entropy and (B) molar-reduced Gibbs free energy.

The conventional prediction treatment of entropy and Gibbs
free
energy values of substances involves a large number of experimental
spectroscopy data. The present procedure involves only six molecular
constant of the COS molecule and calculations begin by inputting directly
the molecular constant values to the analytical representations. This
merit can help engineers to acquire directly and quickly thermochemical
property data of COS. Because acid gas COS is toxic and corrosive,
the experimental thermochemical data are scarce. The reason is that
performing experimental measurements on COS is fraught with difficulties
as breath of it can injure people at concentrations researchers sometimes
encounter. The present prediction models provide available computational
means as the alternatives to obtain the required thermochemical property
data.

3 Conclusions
We present two analytical
representations for the entropy and Gibbs
free energy calculations of COS. The proposed procedure merely rely
on experimental values of six molecular constants of the COS molecule.
The average relative deviations of molar entropy and reduced molar
Gibbs free energy values for COS from the NIST database are 0.150
and 0.189%, respectively. The agreement of the predictions with the
NIST data is very good. The new prediction strategy for the entropy
and Gibbs free energy can be adapted to other substances such as methane.

4 Computational Methods
The COS molecule is a linear
nonsymmetric triatomic molecule. As
shown in Figure 2,
the COS molecule contains internal symmetric stretching vibration,
antisymmetric stretching vibration, and a degenerate pair of bending
vibrations. Our strategy to treat these vibrations is to choose the
improved Tietz oscillator36 and harmonic
oscillator to represent symmetric vibration and other vibrations,
respectively. An expression for the vibrational partition function
subject to the symmetric stretching mode of COS can be derived based
on the utilization of the improved Tietz oscillator36 and reaches the following form from eq 14 of ref (37) 1  where De denotes
the energy to dissociate COS into CO and S, k denotes
the Boltzmann constant, T denotes the absolute temperature, , , , , , and ; here, h is the Planck
constant, μOS represents the reduced mass of oxygen and sulfur
atoms, reOS = reCO + reCS, reCO represents the C–O bond length, reCS represents the C–S bond length, and q is
a dimensionless adjustable parameter. The ± signs are taken as
the plus and minus for q < 0 and q > 0, respectively. The parameter α is given by  Here, , c is the speed of light,
and ωes represents the symmetric stretching frequency.
The symbol erfi stands for the imaginary error function. The factor
e1/13 stands for the contributions of the excited states
of the COS molecule to the vibrational partition function. The symbol vmax is the highest vibrational quantum number,
and  Here, [x] stands
for the
greatest integer, which is less than x for noninteger x.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the vibration modes of the COS molecule.

We attribute the antisymmetric stretching vibration
and bending
vibrations of the COS molecule to harmonic vibrations. The corresponding
vibrational partition function can be represented by37 2  where Θν = hcωe/k, ωe stands for the equilibrium frequency.

The basic thermodynamic formula employed in deriving analytical
representations of the entropy and Gibbs free energy of COS are the
following thermodynamic relationships 3   4  

From eqs 1, 3, and 4, we can obtain the
molar vibrational entropy and Gibbs free energy subject to the contributions
of the symmetric stretching vibration of COS and represent them as
follows, respectively 5   6  where R is the universal
gas constant. From eqs 2–4, we arrive at the following two expressions
for the molar vibrational entropy and Gibbs free energy accompanied
subject to contributions of the antisymmetric stretching vibration
and two bending vibrations of COS 7   8  where Θva = hcωea/k and
Θvb = hcωeb/k; here, ωea and ωeb stand for the
antisymmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration frequencies
of COS, respectively.

The molar entropies subject to contributions
of translation and
rotation of COS can be represented by,50 respectively 9   10  where , mCOS refers
to the mass of the COS molecule, ICOS represents
the rotational inertia of the COS molecule, and P represents the gas pressure. Refering to the literature,51 the molar Gibbs free energies subject to contributions
of translation and rotation of COS can be written as follows, respectively 11   12  With the help of eqs 5–12, we obtain
analytical representations of the total molar entropy and Gibbs free
energy of COS as follows, respectively 13   14  

Because there
are only six basic molecular constants involved in
our calculation models, including De, reCO, reCS, ωes, ωea, and ωeb, predictions
of the molar entropy and Gibbs free energy of COS would become direct
and simple through the proposed analytical representations 13 and 14. In order to see what
effect the temperature would have on the predicted thermochemical
properties of COS, we calculate the molar entropy and Gibbs free energy
values of COS at different temperatures.
