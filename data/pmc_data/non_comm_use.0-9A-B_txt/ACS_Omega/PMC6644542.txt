Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy represents
one of the most popular analytical techniques in chemical research
labs. A variety of vendors provide instruments that are suited for
the analysis of liquid samples at moderate concentrations. However,
to accommodate more specialized experiments, expensive accessories
are required and often do not fit the specific needs of experimental
scientists. In this work, we present a generalized adapter that can
be 3D printed and used with existing spectrometers to enable a wide
array of experiments to be performed. In the case of liquid samples,
we provide a method for dramatically reducing the price of a quartz
cuvette with minimal impact on performance. Through simple modification
of the design, cuvettes with various path lengths can be prepared.
Additionally, we illustrate the ability to turn any sample container
into a working cuvette to simplify experimental protocols, prevent
contamination risks, and further reduce costs. This strategy also
enables gaseous and solid samples to be evaluated easily and reproducibly.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how this concept can be extended to interface
additional instrumentation with a commercial UV–vis spectrometer.
All of the digital designs are provided under a creative commons license
to enable other researchers to modify and adapt the designs for their
unique experimental requirements.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
origins of rapid prototyping lie in the early 1980s with the
first development of three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies.1−3 In more recent years, 3D printing has become increasingly popular
in both commercial and retail settings. This popularity is aided by
the ease of sharing designs between individuals and the increased
availability of 3D printers, particularly fused deposition modeling
printers. The availability of free and user-friendly computer-aided
design (CAD) programs allows for easy construction or customization
of designs. These designs can then be printed, using a variety of
specific techniques, to bring the digital design into the physical
form. This rapid prototyping technique has found a variety of applications
in a wide range of fields owing to the low cost of materials and the
unique structures that can be made.

Recently, there has been
a rise in scientific tools and software
that can be downloaded and modified.4 Examples
of these tools can be found in recent review articles written on this
topic.4,5 These tools include examples of entire instrumentation6,7 as well as platforms to interface with or enhance the capabilities
of existing instrumentation.8−12

In this work, we focus on the development of 3D printed structures
specifically designed to enhance the capability of commercial ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrometers. The UV–vis spectrometer is a
tool used to evaluate the transmission or absorption of light through
a sample. The relevant energies associated with the UV-vis region
of the electromagnetic spectrum make this technique particularly powerful
for analyzing the energy levels of materials ranging from molecules
to semiconducting nanoparticles. Recent publications have demonstrated
how spectrometers can be assembled using 3D printed housing and operated
using a smartphone.6,13 However, the relatively low cost
of commercial instruments means that most researchers have access
to spectrometers that are capable of using a traditional cuvette sample
holder. Although standard cuvette sample holders are routinely used
to evaluate the absorption of common liquids, there are countless
examples of experiments that require different adaptations to be made
to evaluate a particular sample under specific conditions.14−16 This has led many commercial manufacturers to generate a suite of
instrumental accessories that are meant to accommodate different experimental
conditions. Unfortunately, these accessories are costly and often
fall short of the specific needs of new experiments at the cutting
edge of science. Previous 3D printed designs are focused on either
holding traditional cuvettes in a nontraditional housing17−19 or are confined to the space of a traditional cuvette.20−22 Here, we present a universal cuvette adapter to enable a wide range
of experiments in an existing UV–vis spectrometer, including
inexpensive strategies for converting most laboratory sample containers
into functional cuvettes. This provides a means to extend the capabilities
of most cuvette-based spectrometers at a fraction of the cost of commercial
accessories. The CAD described in this work is available under a creative
commons license to encourage its use by other researchers and allow
for further development.

2 Results and Discussion
UV–vis spectrometers are one of the most common pieces of
major equipment in research laboratories around the world. Information
regarding the absorption and transmission of UV–visible light
can provide insights into a wide variety of questions. However, the
evaluation of different kinds of samples often requires the purchase
of expensive accessories that may not be ideal for the specific experiment
envisioned by the researcher. Here, we provide a general framework
for an accessory adapter that will work in most commercial UV–vis
spectrometers and provide examples of the kinds of adaptations that
can be made to facilitate different types of experiments at low cost.

The most common sample holder used in a spectrometer is the cuvette.
A traditional cuvette has outer dimensions of 12.5 × 12.5 ×
45 mm, with an interior path length of 10 mm. Cuvettes of this size
typically require 2.5–3.5 mL of a liquid sample to acquire
an acceptable absorbance spectrum. Cuvettes can be manufactured from
a variety of materials such as plastic, glass, and quartz. The choice
of material often depends on the required wavelength range of the
experiment and the solvent compatibility of the material. Although
the wavelength range of glass and quartz is significantly larger than
that of plastic, the cost is also 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher
per cuvette. To enable more researchers to utilize these superior
materials, we have developed a cuvette adapter that uses either glass
or quartz windows on a 3D printed support structure (Figure 1). The adapter requires at
least 21 mm of space in the sample compartment of the spectrometer
either before or after the commercial cuvette sample holder. After
surveying several spectrometer vendors, most research-grade spectrometers
have significantly more space in their sample compartment than the
required 21 mm. Exceptions include teaching-grade spectrometers and
specialized spectrometers (e.g., NanoDrop). The windows of the cuvette
can be prepared from either a traditional glass microscope slide cut
into three sections or a commercially available planar quartz glass
sample (window measurement is 25 mm × 25 mm). This brings the
cost of a glass sample holder down to approximately $1 USD and the
cost of a quartz sample holder down to approximately $14 USD, including
the cost of the 3D printed plastic support (Table S1). Importantly, these adapted sample holders have nearly
the same spectral range as the commercially available glass and quartz
cuvettes (Figure 1D).
The slight differences observed in the UV and near-infrared regions
are caused by differences in the glass used in the adapter compared
with the glass used in the commercial cuvette.

adapter taken from the side. The portion to the right is placed in

(ABS) for visual contrast. (D) Comparison of the transmittance spectra
between commercial cuvettes and 3D printed cuvette adapters prepared
with either quartz windows or glass windows.

The major advantage of the 3D printed sample holder is that
the
digital design of the 3D printed support can be easily modified. As
a demonstration of this capability, we have designed a variety of
cuvettes with different sample volume requirements and path lengths
(Figure 2). As shown
in Figure 2A, we have
found that changing the sample volume has a negligible effect on the
absorbance. In fact, the slight difference between the commercial
cuvette and the 3D printed cuvettes can be attributed to the slight
error in path length caused by the resolution of the 3D printer (Table S2). Although changing the printing speed
does not result in a significant source of error, the tolerances of
the 3D printer used in this study result in a path length that is
extended by an average of 0.46 mm. Accounting for these variances
by measuring the printed path length with calipers, the error can
be reduced to less than 0.74%. Alternatively, the CAD can be modified
to account for the tolerances of the 3D printer. For the 3D printer
used in this study, reducing the path length of the digital design
from 10 to 9.5 mm reduced the printer error (Figure S1), although this would likely be different for other 3D printers.
Intentionally changing the path length follows the predicted behavior
of Beer’s law when using an aqueous 10 μM sample of methylene
blue (Figure 2B). For
all of these designs, the cost of each cell only changes according
to the price of the plastic required for the 3D printed support, as
the window material remains the same. This is a significant difference
compared with commercial extended path length cuvettes, which have
significantly higher costs owing to the increase in quartz and glass
that must be used. This strategy will allow researchers to easily
increase the path length to improve the detection limit (Figure S2) or decrease the path length for concentrated
samples, thereby increasing the dynamic range of the spectrometer.

Figure 2 Effect
of sample volume and path length on the performance of the
UV–vis cuvette adapter. (A) Spectra of 5 μM methylene
blue in commercial cuvette and 3D printed cuvette adapters with different
sample volumes but all possessing a designed path length of 10 mm.
(B) Peak absorbance of 5 μM methylene blue in cuvettes designed
with different path lengths. The size of the red square data point
represents the error in the absorbance value and measured path length
of three different printed cuvette adapters. The path length was determined
by measurement with digital calipers. The black line represents the
predicted absorbance versus path length according to Beer’s
law.

Additionally, there are many liquid
samples that researchers would
prefer to keep in a different container for simplicity or to prevent
contamination from the air or environment. In Figure 3A, we demonstrate the use of a variety of
glass vials, centrifuge tubes, and an NMR tube to develop a calibration
curve for the concentration of methylene blue. For all of the sample
containers tested, the increase in methylene blue concentration resulted
in a linear change in the absorbance according to Beer’s law.
As expected, sample containers that inherently have longer path lengths
will have higher absorbance values compared to those with shorter
path lengths. These containers are also expected to reach signal saturation
earlier than containers with shorter path lengths. Although the nonplanar
shape may make the determination of the path length and molar absorptivity
more challenging, these unique sample holders may allow researchers
to perform more accurate or high-throughput experiments as the transfer
of the sample to a traditional cuvette is no longer required. Noteworthy
is the fact that these designs do not require any glass or quartz
to be applied and do not need to be watertight, which simplifies the
experiment, prevents contamination problems, and further reduces the
cost. Additionally, by using gas-tight containers, these accessories
can enable the evaluation of gaseous samples, as demonstrated by the
analysis of NO2 gas in Figure 3B. Here, the equilibrium between NO2 and N2O4 at different temperatures is demonstrated
by simply placing the gas-tight vial filled with NO2 in
different temperature environments and using the appropriate adapter
to observe the expected trend.23−25

Figure 3 Adapter capabilities for various sample
holders. (A) Peak absorbance
of methylene blue as a function of concentration for a wide range
of liquid sample holders including commercial quartz cuvette (black
square), glass test tube (light green triangle), screw cap vial (orange
circle), 15 mL centrifuge tube (blue triangle), gas chromatography
vial (pink circle), 2 mL microcentrifuge tube (purple diamond), 50
mL centrifuge tube (red square), and an NMR tube (dark green diamond).
All absorbance values represent averages from the three measurements.
(B) Absorbance of NO2 at 425 nm as a function of temperature.
NO2 sample was kept in a gas chromatography vial. Measurements
represent the average of the three different samples with different
orders through the range of temperatures. Data were normalized based
on the absorbance of each sample at 92 °C.

There are also many instances when the sample of interest
is a
solid rather than a liquid or gas. In these cases, commercial accessories
can be challenging to use depending on the area of interest relative
to optical viewing window of the sample holder. Here, a 40 mM methylene
blue solution was prepared in isopropanol and spin-coated onto a microscope
slide patterned with scotch tape. As shown in Figure 4A, the adapter can be easily modified to
accommodate the samples of different shapes and location with effectively
no change in the spectrum. As this design does not require the addition
of glass or quartz, the minimal cost of the 3D printed object enables
the use of custom sample holders for individual samples if necessary.
The ability to edit the CAD can also allow researchers to systematically
change the sample angle relative to the beam path for experiments
requiring increased absorbance or unique analysis (Figure 4B).

blue films on the surface of glass microscope
slides. (A) Absorbance spectrum of films covering a large region (black),
covering a limited square portion (red), covering a triangular shaped

Photographs of the samples analyzed are included as insets. (B) Absorbance
of the film at 500 nm as a function of sample angle. Theoretically,
the path length increases as 1/cos(angle).

In Figure 5, we
demonstrate how this universal cuvette adapter can be used to interface
additional analytical methods to perform spectroelectrochemical analysis
of the classical blue bottle experiment.26,27 The general design of this unique accessory allows for the placement
of three electrodes, the capability of the holding electrolyte, and
the addition of a gas (Figure S3). The
results demonstrate how dissolved gases affect the electrolyte solution.
Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses are performed simultaneously
to determine the effect of the oxidation state on the optical properties.
Most importantly, this experiment provides a proof-of-concept for
the interfacing of multiple instruments through the use of a simple
3D printed accessory that costs less than $2 USD to prepare.

Absorbance at 664 nm (black curve) and oxidative current (red curve)
were taken as a function of time. Oxidative current was determined
from cyclic voltammograms taken throughout the experiment. Compressed
air was bubbled into the electrolyte solution at 65 s. Bubbling was
stopped at 220 s.

3 Conclusions
Here, we have developed a general design for a 3D printed adapter
for a traditional UV–vis spectrometer, which can be used to
replace expensive cuvettes with inexpensive alternatives while maintaining
the same functionality. Through simple modification of the digital
design, we have demonstrated the ability to change the sample volume
or path length, hold various sample containers, analyze gaseous or
solid samples, and interface the spectrometer with additional equipment.
We believe that these designs will make UV–vis spectroscopy
more affordable and more versatile for researchers working in a wide
range of fields. From a practical perspective, we note that the printing
of a standard adapter typically takes about 1.5 h and that the assembly
of this adapter can take up to 2 h including the adhesion time for
the addition of glass or quartz windows (Supporting Video). We recommend the use of black filaments, as UV–vis
cuvette adapters prepared with other colors may impact the resulting
spectrum. Although most cuvettes used in this work were printed with
an infill of 100% to ensure water tightness, experiments performed
with 3D printed cuvette adapters with infill values as low as 10%
were found to be watertight for over 2 weeks. Additionally, not all
3D printed thermoplastics are compatible with all solvents. ABS, for
example, will dissolve in acetone. Using polylactic acid (PLA), however,
will enable the use of acetone but may not be compatible with other
solvents. Thus, the choice of a 3D printing filament may impact the
possible experimental conditions. Alternatively, using an adapter
capable of holding a suitable sample container (such as those demonstrated
in Figure 3) avoids
potential solvent compatibility issues entirely and also prevents
contamination between different samples.

All of the digital
designs developed in this work are available
free of charge under a creative commons license and can be found on
the digital sharing site Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/LeBlanc-Research-Group/designs).
We sincerely hope that researchers use and modify this general accessory
to suit the needs of their unique experiments. For research groups
without easy access to 3D printers, there are a variety of companies
that will perform 3D printing and ship the custom part for a minimal
fee (e.g., https://www.shapeways.com/). As these designs can be digitally shared and printed at low cost,
we anticipate that more complex UV–vis experiments will be
developed, with designs that can be subsequently shared for increased
reproducibility. More broadly, this work demonstrates the ability
to use 3D printing to enhance the capabilities of common instrumentation.
Extending this concept to other instruments is of ongoing interest
to our research group and the scientific community in general.
