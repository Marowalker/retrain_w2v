Currently, antibiotic resistance
and cancer are two of the most
important public health problems killing more than ∼1.5 million
people annually, showing that antibiotics and current chemotherapeutics
are not as effective as they were in the past. Nanotechnology is presented
here as a potential solution. However, current protocols for the traditional
physicochemical synthesis of nanomaterials are not free of environmental
and social drawbacks, often involving the use of toxic catalysts.
This article shows the production of pure naked selenium nanoparticles
(SeNPs) by a novel green process called pulsed laser ablation in liquids
(PLAL). After the first set of irradiations, another set was performed
to reduce the size below 100 nm, which resulted in a colloidal solution
of spherical SeNPs with two main populations having sizes around ∼80
and ∼10 nm. The particles after the second set of irradiations
also showed higher colloidal stability. SeNPs showed a dose-dependent
antibacterial effect toward both standard and antibiotic-resistant
phenotypes of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria at a range
of concentrations between 0.05 and 25 ppm. Besides, the SeNPs showed
a low cytotoxic effect when cultured with human dermal fibroblasts
cells at a range of concentrations up to 1 ppm while showing an anticancer
effect toward human melanoma and glioblastoma cells at the same concentration
range. This article therefore introduces the possibility of using
totally naked SeNPs synthesized by a new PLAL protocol as a novel
and efficient nanoparticle fabrication process for biomedical applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Over the past several decades, there has
been some significant
growing concerns related to bacteria and cancer that have been threatening
our global healthcare system.1 The overuse
and misuse of antibiotics have brought society to the post-antibiotic
era, making these drugs no longer as effective as they used to be,
consequently leading to a continuous rise of antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) cases.2,3 On the other hand, cancer is the
second leading cause of death worldwide.4,5 The use of
current treatments, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or the combination
of both, present plenty of reported side effects having a high impact
on a patient’s life.6 Moreover,
recent studies show that, in a similar way that bacteria have adapted
to conventional drug treatment, tumors are able to develop resistance
toward chemotherapy drugs presenting a new class of chemotherapeutic-resistant
cancer cells.7 Therefore, AMR and cancer
are craving for an immediate solution far away from current and old-fashioned
traditional treatments for which we have outgrown.

Nanotechnology
is presented here as a suitable solution,8 with a deep focus on materials with at least
one dimension below 100 nm, as a field, which has seen rising interest
since its beginning around the 1960s.9 The
impact of nanotechnology into medicine comes from size-dependent material
properties10 that materials offer when
confined within nanoscale dimensions and also from the ability of
the nanostructures to interact efficiently with biological materials
due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, making them extremely
reactive.11,12 Since its inception, a large variety of
nanomaterials, including metallic, polymeric, or biomolecule-based
nanomaterials (from nanoparticles (NPs) and nanowires (NWs) to nanotubes
(NTs) or nanocomposites), have been reported as useful in the fight
toward both bacterial infections and cancer.13 The ability of nanomaterials to show biomedical properties has been
related to different mechanisms. One of the most reported processes
involves the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group
of oxygen-containing compounds including radicals and nonradicals
(like superoxide (O2·–) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), respectively).14 Therefore, the contact between nanoparticles
and biological membranes in cells trigger the production of ROS, affecting
the survival of the living organisms and producing different reponses
that may lead to antibacterial or anticancer effects.15,16 For instance, selenium (Se), either pure or capped with chitosan,
was efficiently tested against bacteria, that is, Escherichia
coli, Staphylococcus aureus,17 and fungi, that is, Candida albicans.18

Nevertheless,
the beneficial impact of nanotechnology on human
health is not always accompanied by a similar beneficial effect in
the environment. As a matter of fact, the growing problem of chemical
contamination from nanoparticle synthesis has demanded the need to
find eco-friendly alternatives to all known chemical and physical
processes. Consequently, nanotechnology has found a suitable answer
in the incorporation of green chemistry principles, giving rise to
what is called green nanotechnology, which pursues nanoparticle reactions
that are environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and safe for both
the environment and the patients.19,20 Therefore,
different raw materials have been used for the generation of nanomaterials,
from living organisms (such as plants,21 bacteria,22 or fungi23) to biocompounds (sourced from edibles24 or food waste25).

From
all over the periodic table, several elements, such Ag or
Au, present antimicrobial and anticancer activity with a low associated
cytotoxicity.26,27 However, some researchers have
reported resistance of bacterial populations to some of these nanostructures,
most notably, AgNPs.28 Therefore, alternative
formulations have been used showing identical or even better effects.
For instance, selenium (Se), a chalcogen element that is present in
trace amounts in the Earth’s core, and due to its scarity,
has been classified by the American Physical Society and the Materials
Research Socity as a critical element.29 Indeed, selenium is widely known as an essential element for life,
found in amino acids and proteins.30−33 Therefore, it is crucial to find
a synthesis protocol that could use selenium in a very efficient way
to allow for its use in various applications, especially medical34 and solar cells.35

Physical methods have also been redesigned and adapted to
these
green principles, producing extremely cost-effective techniques without
the production of toxic by-products. One of these techniques is pulsed
laser ablation in liquids (PLAL), which is capable of producing NPs
with sizes between 5 and 120 nm in an environmentally-friendly fashion.
PLAL uses an electrical charge at the surface of the nanoparticle
to promote electrostatic repulsion in order to prevent NPs from agglomerating.
As reported in the literature, this technique is capable of creating
nanostructures with biomedical applications.

In this research,
SeNPs were produced by a clean, environmentally
friendly, and cost-effective PLAL approach. The protocol was optimized
to produce a large amount of SeNPs within 10 min of irradiation (first
set of irradiation, 5 min; second set of irradiation, 5 min). The
structures were characterized in terms of morphology, size, and composition,
utilizing a variety of techniques, and their antibacterial properties
were tested on antibiotic-resistant bacteria (such as multidrug-resistant E. coli (MDR) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)) and regular bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Staphylococcus
epidermitis (SE)) strains. Furthermore, SeNP anticancer
properties were determined on human malignant melanoma and glioblastoma
cells showing a promising decrease on cell proliferation while remaining
biocompatible toward human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). Consequently,
PLAL-synthesized SeNPs are presented here as a suitable biomedical
tool whose production can overcome the surface purity limitation of
the traditional wet-chemical synthesis of nanomaterials.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Se NPs
For the production of SeNPs,
a pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) technique was used. The
experimental setup employed is illustrated in Figure 1a. Briefly, a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Electro
Scientific Industries) operating at a 1064 nm wavelength was used
to irradiate the target, which consisted of bulk Se pellets (99.999%
from Sigma Aldrich), ∼2 mm in diameter. The pellets were immersed
in deionized (DI) water (5 mL), contained in a 50 mL rounded single-neck
glass flask. Consequently, the height of the liquid above the surface
of the target was set at 8 mm. The pulse repetition rate of the laser
varied from 100 to 5000 Hz, and the pulse duration time varied from
70 to 200 ns depending on the repetition rate. The laser shined a
pulsed beam with an energy per pulse around a 16.5 mJ pulse–1 at 1000 Hz. The beam was deflected by a flat mirror oriented at
a 45-degree angle (with respect to the laser rail) in order to irradiate
the target from the top and was then focused by using an 83 mm focal
length lens. The spot size of the beam on the target was measured
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to be around ∼45 μm.
Therefore, the intensity of the laser was determined to be around
∼1 × 106 W cm–2. At 1000
Hz, the fluence was calculated to be ∼1 × 103 J cm–2. The target was finally irradiated for
5 min. After irradiation, the particles contained in the solution
were irradiated again to reduce the size while being contained in
a test tube, which was submerged in an ice bath in order to reduce
agglomeration due to melting during the second irradiation, see Figure 1b. The colloidal
solution containing the nanoparticles produced by the laser ablation
of the target was then stored in a black Eppendorf microtube in order
to be protected from ambient light.

Physico-Chemical Characterization of Se NPs
After synthesis,
the samples were characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy (Cary
5000 from Agilent), atomic emission spectroscopy (4210 MP-AES from
Agilent), dynamic light scattering (NanoBrook 90Plus from Brookhaven
Instruments Corporation), Raman spectroscopy (EZRaman-N from Enwave
Optronics, Inc.), scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM–7000F
SEM, equipped with a field emission gun and operating at 30 kV), transmission
electron microscopy (JEOL 2100-F TEM operating at 80 kV), and atomic
force microscopy (Bruker Icon AFM). To perform SEM, AFM, and TEM analyses,
a droplet of the colloidal solution was deposited onto a silicon wafer
(SEM, AFM) and copper grid (TEM). Both substrates were then dried
in an environmentally controlled glove box. AFM studies were performed
in tapping mode using a silicon AFM probe from Ted Pella, Inc. [prod
no. TAP300-G-10] with a resonant frequency of 300 kHz and a force
constant of 40 N/m.

Antimicrobial Characterization of SeNPs
A total of
four different strains of bacteria were tested for antimicrobial properties
using the SeNPs: two Gram-negative bacteria (multidrug-resistant E. coli (MDR-EC) (ATCC BAA-2471; ATCC, Manassas,
VA) and P. aeruginosa (PA) (ATCC 27853,
ATCC, Manassas, VA)) and two Gram-Positive strains (methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 4330; ATCC, Manassas, VA)
and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE)
(ATCC 35984; ATCC, Manassas, VA)) were utilized for the antibacterial
tests. The cultures were kept on agar plates at 4 °C.

Colony
counting unit assays were completed by seeding the bacteria in a 96-well
plate mixed with different concentrations of SeNPs. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 8 h; after that period of time, they were
removed from the incubator and diluted with PBS in a series of vials
by ×104 ×105 and ×106. Three drops of 10 μL were taken of each dilution and deposited
on an LB agar plate. The plates were deposited inside an incubator
at 37 °C until the colonies grew enough without reaching confluency.
Afterward, the numbers of colonies formed were counted, and the data
was processed.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Characterization of
SeNPs
Cytotoxicity
assays were performed with primary human dermal fibroblasts (TCC PCS-201-012TM,
Manassas, VA), melanoma cells (ATCC CRL-1619, Manassas, VA), and glioblastoma
(T98G [T98-G] (ATCC CRL-1690) cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ATCC 30–2020,
American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). MTS assays (CellTiter 96
AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI)
were carried out to assess cytotoxicity. Cells were seeded onto tissue
culture-treated 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) at a final concentration of 5000 cells per well in 100 μL
of cell medium. After an incubation period of 24 h at 37 °C in
a humidified incubator with 5% carbon dioxide (CO2), the
culture medium was replaced with 100 μL of fresh cell medium
containing different concentrations of SeNPs.

Cells were cultured
for another 24 and 72 h for the 1 and 3 days of experiments, respectively,
at the same incubation conditions. The media was then removed, and
cells were washed twice with PBS. A total of 100 μL of the MTS
solution (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium solution), prepared using a mixing ratio of
1:5 of MTS:medium, was then added. After the addition of the solution,
the 96-well plate was incubated for 4 h in the incubator to allow
for a color change. Then, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm on
an absorbance plate reader (SpectraMAX M3, Molecular Devices) for
cell viability after exposure to the SeNPs. Cell viability was calculated
by dividing the average absorbance obtained for each sample by the
one achieved by the control sample and then multiplied by 100. Optical
density was then converted to cells mL–1 using appropriate
cell line standardization curves. Controls containing cells and media
and only media, were also included in the 96-well plate to identify
the normal growth of cells without nanoparticles and to determine
the absorbance of the media itself.

Reactive Oxygen Species
Analysis
For reactive oxygen
species (ROS) quantification, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(H2DCFDA) was used, as well as human melanoma cells. The
cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a concentration of 5 ×
104 cells mL–1 in the presence of different
concentrations of the SeNPs as well as in the control without any
nanoparticles. The cells were cultured under standard culture conditions
at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with a 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) atmosphere for 24 h before the experiment. Briefly, the
ROS indicator was reconstituted in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
to make a concentrated stock solution. Then, the media were carefully
removed, and a fixed volume of the indicator in PBS was added to each
one of the wells at a final concentration of 10 μM. The cells
were incubated for 30 min at the optimal temperature, and the loading
buffer was removed thereafter. Fresh media were added, and cells were
allowed to recover. The baseline for fluorescence intensity of a sample
for the loaded cell period of exposure was determined. Besides, positive controls were tested, stimulating
the oxidative activity with hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration
of 50 μM. The intensity of fluorescence was then observed by
flow cytometry. Measurements were taken by an increase in fluorescence
at 530 nm when the sample was excited at 485 nm. Fluorescence was
also determined in the negative control, untreated sample loaded with
dyed cells maintained in a buffer.

Statistical Analysis
All biological experiments (see Antimicrobial
Characterization of SeNPs, In Vitro Cytotoxicity
Characterization of SeNPs, and Reactive
Oxygen Species Analysis)
were repeated in triplicate (n = 3) to ensure the
reliability of the results. Statistical significance was assessed
using Student’s t tests, with a p < 0.05 being statistically significant. Results are displayed
as mean ± standard deviation.

Results and Discussion
Physico-Chemical
Characterization of Se NPs
A colloidal
solution of the SeNPs was generated by pulsed laser ablation in DI
water by varying the laser repetition rate from 100 Hz to 5 kHz (Figure 2a). A series of samples
were produced at 100, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 Hz. The irradiation
time was set to 5 min for all samples. The volume of DI water used
as the solvent was 5 mL for each sample. From the series, it was possible
to report that the maximal production of NPs reached around 3000 Hz.
Indeed, most samples (1000–5000 Hz) displayed an orange coloration
(due to the production of SeNPs) with the most intense coloration
obtained at 3000 Hz. No coloration was noticed for the sample synthesized
at 100 Hz (Figure 2a).

in the photo, which is the inset. Inset: photo of colloidal solutions
from 100 to 5000 Hz from left to right (credit: Tina Hesabizadeh).
(b) Various concentrations of selenium in the colloidal solutions
synthesized by PLAL at various repetition rates. The maximum was reached
at 3028 ± 58 Hz. The irradiation time was set to 5 min for all
samples.

UV–visible spectroscopy
performed on all the samples demonstrated
that different aliquots mainly absorbed in the violet-blue-green region
of the visible spectrum. Hence, the samples exhibited a complementary
color located in the orange-red region of the spectrum (Figure 2a).

With the aim to complete
a quantitative analysis of the samples,
the concentration of Se in each colloidal solution was measured by
AES. A Lorentz curve was applied to fit the data displayed in Figure 2b. The optimal repetition
rate was reached at 3028 ± 58 Hz. As the production decreased
after passing this repetition rate, it can be hypothesized that the
cavitation bubble was being hit. Indeed, the interaction between the
pulsed beam and the target created a high-temperature plasma. This
energy was transferred to the surrounding liquid causing it to vaporize
creating a cavitation bubble containing the NPs. The lifetime of the
cavitation bubble varied from microseconds to milliseconds, depending
on the laser pulse parameters.36 In the
present case, the cavitation bubble lifetime was estimated to be around
0.330 ± 0.06 ms, the value obtained by taking the reciprocal
value of the repetition rate at the maximal production. Indeed, when
the production started decreasing when the frequency increased beyond
3000 Hz due to the pulsed beam hitting the cavitation bubble, the
formation of more nanoparticles was prevented. When the cavitation
bubble finally collapsed, the nanoparticles were released into the
solvent. Therefore, to bypass the cavitation bubble temporally and
maximize the production of nanoparticles, the repetition rate was
chosen at 3000 Hz close to the maximal value determined to be at 3028
± 58 Hz by AES. The concentration reached at 3000 Hz was around
40 ppm, which is the concentration required for antibacterial applications
to remove ∼30% of E. coli and
∼50% of S. aureus.(17)

As can be seen in Figure 3a, the size distribution of
the SeNPs was centered at 144
± 46 nm after the first set of irradiation. Furthermore, the
nanoparticles were not stable because the zeta potential was smaller
than 30 mV (Figure 3b), which means that they easily agglomerated (Figure 3c). The morphology of these selenium nanoparticles
synthesized at 3000 Hz was not perfectly spherical as is also shown
in Figure 3c. In order
to improve the morphology of those nanoparticles, the second set of
irradiation (without focusing the beam) was performed for 5 min within
a test tube to reshape the nanoparticles and decrease their size distribution
to smaller sizes (Figure 3d). The test tube was kept in a refrigerated ice bath to prevent
the colloidal solution from boiling, see Figure 1b for illustration of new setup. The size
and zeta potential were determined to be 43 ± 20 nm and 66 ±
3 mV, respectively (Figure 3d,e). When this value is more significant than 30 mV, the
colloidal solution can be considered stable, that is, there is no
agglomeration or flocculation.37 This is
likely the reason why the nanoparticle dispersion was observed to
be highly stable for at least 3 months. From the SEM observations
(Figure 3f), the shape
of the Se NPs were spherical, which is in agreement with what other
groups observed when the synthesis was performed in DI water.38−41

is centered at 144 ± 46 nm. (b) Zeta potential was measured to
be −24 ± 16 mV, meaning that the colloidal solution was
not stable with time. (c) SEM image of the selenium nanoparticles

in Figure 1a. The spherical
shape is not well-defined after the first 5 min set of irradiations.

that the colloidal solution is going to be stable with time. (f) SEM
image of the selenium nanoparticles synthesized after two sets of
irradiations at 3000 Hz (first set of irradiation performed within
a rounded flask cuvette, second set of irradiation performed within
a test tube surrounded with ice). The irradiation time was kept to
5 min for both sets of irradiations.

From the TEM observations, the sphericity of the nanoparticles
was also confirmed (Figure 4a), and the amorphous structure was determined by electron
diffraction (Figure 4b). The Raman spectra (Figure 4c) demonstrated that amorphous selenium nanoparticles were
synthesized39,41,42 and also proved that no selenium oxides were synthesized.43 This is in excellent agreement with ref (18) where larger nanoparticles
are amorphous and smaller ones are crystalline. The size, where the
amorphous–crystalline transition occurs, depends strongly on
the solvent temperature during synthesis.

selenium nanoparticle with its
size ∼85 nm, and (b) its corresponding diffraction pattern
revealing the amorphous structure of the selenium nanoparticle. (c)
Raman spectra performed on selenium nanoparticles deposited on a silicon
wafer confirming the amorphous structure of the selenium nanoparticles.

In order to more accurately determine the size
distribution of
the particles contained in the colloidal solution, AFM and high-magnification
TEM studies were completed additionally. In Figure 5a, we see the sample after being drop-casted
onto silicon and dried overnight, and it reaveals a very broad size
distribution ranging from ∼1 to ∼150 nm, which is common
by the PLAL technique.17,18,38,39,41 The AFM studies
confirmed what was previously observed by SEM and DLS, but it also
revealed a higher percentage of particles around and below 10 nm.
The reason why the smallest population of nanoparticles was not observable
with the DLS is because the intensity of the DLS signal is proportional
to the sixth power of the diameter’s particle d6, which heavily biases the signal toward the largest
particles in the solution.37,44 From the TEM images,
we also observed smaller-sized particles, which were not observed
by SEM or DLS. Some of the SeNPs sizes are below the exciton Bohr
radius of Se, which is ∼5 nm40 (Figure 5b). This population
of Se quantum dots represents ∼1% of all the Se NPs present
in the colloidal solution.

TEM (scale bar is 10 nm) showing some selenium quantum dots.

Antimicrobial Characterization of SeNPs
In order to
determine the antibacterial activity of the SeNPs, colony counting
unit assays were conducted in the presence of four different bacteria
with standard and antibiotic-resistant phenotypes: two Gram-negative
(PA and MDR-EC) and two Gram-positive (SE and MRSA). The results showed
different inhibition trends of the bacterial species with a higher
impact when the SeNPs were presented in the cell cultures of Gram-negative
bacteria. MDR-EC showed an evident dose-dependent inhibition when
the SeNPs were used. Besides, it is also possible to extract that
a 1 ppm concentration was enough to cause inhibition in bacteria proliferation,
with a clear significance compared to smaller concentrations. Further
analysis was conducted using colony counting unit assays, with results
plotted in Figure 6a–d. The experiments conducted with MRSA (Figure 6a), MDR-EC (Figure 6b), SE (Figure 6c), and PA (Figure 6d) showed a dose-dependent inhibition of
bacterial growth when exposed to different concentrations of SeNPs.
The nanostructures were active toward both the Gram-negative and positive
bacteria at a range of concentrations between 0.5 and 25 ppm,. Therefore,
SeNPs showed an effective bacterial inhibition at concentrations ∼25
ppm.

concentrations of SeNPs. All values represent the mean ± standard
deviation. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01(compared to controls).

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values
were calculated
for the four investigated bacteria as an extension of the antibacterial
behavior (Table 1).
These values differ from others found in the literature, showing either
a decrease or similarity to the MIC values. For instance, different
chemically synthesized SeNPs showed MIC values around 100 ppm when
cultured with P. aeruginosa,45 while MIC values of 125 ppm were found when
SeNPS were used to inhibit the proliferation of both S. epidermidis and S. aureus.(46) Besides, for E. coli, MIC values of 15 ppm were reported by Muthu
et al. when SeNPs were used as antimicrobial agents.47 The lower MIC values calculated in the present work demonstrate
that Se NPs synthesized by PLAL are more efficient to kill bacteria
than their counterparts synthesized by wet chemistry. This may be
attributed to the naked surface of the Se NPs being directly in contact
with the bacteria’s surface.

SEM micrographs of control MDR-EC
and MRSA (Figure 7a,c)
and bacteria after treatment with a
selected concentration of SeNPs (Figure 7b,d) are shown. The characterization indicated
that the treatment with the nanostructures induced changes of both
bacterial strains, such as the disruption of the outer cell membrane.
Furthermore, cell analysis can be easily seen after treatment with
SeNPs. As a consequence, clear cell damage was observed with an abundant
presence of cracks all over the cell membrane as well as bacterial
deformation and collapse. Cell membrane damage is commonly found to
be a cause of the action of ROS (as determined in the following section).
Nevertheless, other mechanisms can also be inferred as the direct
damage of the cells due to the morphology of the nanostructures.14,48

In the light of the results, medium and higher concentrations
of
SeNPs might be useful for coating of external medical devices or surfaces
that need to be sterilized.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Characterization of
Se NPs
To
determine the cytotoxicity of the SeNPs on mammalian cells, in vitro
MTS assays were performed with human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and
human melanoma and human glioblastoma cells using SeNPs concentrations
ranging from 0.05 to 1 ppm for between 24 and 72 h (Figure 8). The SeNP range was restricted
to 1 ppm for two reasons: no higher concentrations are expected to
be introduced in the body, and a significant cell proliferation inhibition
was found beyond 1 ppm. As shown in Figure 8a, a nanoparticle concentration ranging between
0.05 and 1 ppm showed no significant cytotoxicity toward HDF cells
over 72 h. Therefore, the SeNPs can be considered biocompatible at
a range of concentrations up to 1 ppm. Moreover, a slight cell proliferation
decay was found when the nanoparticles were cultured with melanoma
cells at the concentration of 1 ppm at a time of up to 72 h (Figure 8b). In order to further
confirm the potential anticancer of the SeNPs, experiments with glioblastoma
cells were done, showing a significant dose-dependent inhibition of
cell proliferation at SeNP concentrations up to 1 ppm (Figure 8c). Thus, the SeNPs could be
considered anticancer at a concentration of 1 ppm for 3-day treatment
for melanoma cells while inducing a smaller anticancer effect at low
concentrations for experiments at 1 and 3 days for brain tumors. However,
further studies must be completed to completely support this hypothesis.

Reactive Oxygen Species Analysis
The analysis of ROS
allowed for the evaluation of toxicity towards human cells. The analysis
was performed by exposing different concentrations (from 0.05 to 1
ppm) of the SeNPs to melanoma cells. After a 24 h treatment, the ROS
could be successfully quantified in the cell media. An increase in
the production of ROS (Figure 9) was observed when the nanoparticles interacted with the
melanoma cells, with a dose-dependent effect. As ROS are species containing
oxygen that are highly reactive, the intracellular mechanisms of defense
have evolved to cope with this undesired chemical with the aim to
avoid damaging the cell. However, under high levels of stress, the
levels of ROS can dramatically increase. Their generation is one of
the focal nanomaterials’ mechanisms of action that triggers
the inhibition of both bacterial growth and cancer cells development.16,49 For the proposed SeNPs, it is well-known that after gaining cellular
internalization, they stimulate the production of ROS. Therefore,
the anticancer behavior previously observed in the presence of the
nanoparticles (Figure 8b) could be easily related to an increase in ROS. In cancer cells,
ROS levels are increased due to both environmental and internal mechanisms,
leading to a high balance of these molecules. The mechanisms to cope
with ROS are compromised and deteriorate within the cancer population,
which contribute to the negative final impact on cancer biology.50

Conclusions
In conclusion, selenium
is a rare element on Earth but essential
to living organisms on this planet. Therefore, an environmentally
friendly PLAL approach was followed for a sustainable, efficient,
and cost-effective production of SeNPs. The lifetime of the cavitation
bubble induced by the irradiation of a Se target immersed in DI water
by a pulsed laser has been determined to be around 0.330 ± 0.06
ms. By irradiating the target at such high repetition rates (kHz range),
it was necessary to cool down the colloidal solution during the irradiation
in order to prohibit the solvent from boiling. Beyond optimizing the
synthesis conditions, the selenium nanoparticles were tested as biomedical
agents. The SeNPs exhibited antibacterial properties in a range of
concentrations between 0.5 to 1 ppm, triggering no significant cytotoxicity
toward human healthy cells over the same period. Furthermore, the
nanoparticles were found to be an anticancer toward human melanoma
and glioblastoma cells at the concentration of 1 ppm for 72 h of treatment.

The reason for using low concentrations of Se NPs (below 1 ppm)
was to ensure their nontoxicity with human cells when used internally
in the human body. However, larger concentration of Se NPs (∼25
ppm) demonstrated strong inhibition and killing behavior on the four
investigated bacteria; the Se NPs could therefore be used externally
as a preventive coating for medical devices. Finally, those “naked”
SeNPs can be used as biomedical agents with both antibacterial and
anticancer properties at very low concentrations. More work is undergoing
to determine if the antibacterial and anticancer properties can be
further improved by changing the morphology of those naked SeNPs.
