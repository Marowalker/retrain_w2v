We have determined the time-dependent
displacement fields in molecular sub-micrometer thin films as response
to femtosecond and picosecond laser pulse heating by time-resolved
X-ray diffraction. This method allows a direct absolute determination
of the molecular displacements induced by electron–phonon interactions,
which are crucial for, for example, charge transport in organic electronic
devices. We demonstrate that two different modes of coherent shear
motion can be photoexcited in a thin film of organic molecules by
careful tuning of the laser penetration depth relative to the thickness
of the film. The measured response of the organic film to impulse
heating is explained by a thermoelastic model and reveals the spatially
resolved displacement in the film. Thereby, information about the
profile of the energy deposition in the film as well as about the
mechanical interaction with the substrate material is obtained.

1 Introduction
When
short laser pulses interact with a molecular solid, the energy is
transferred to the electronic structure within 1 fs.1 The dynamical aspects of this process are key in, for example,
charge transport in organic electronic devices.2,3 Subsequent
to excitation, the energy is transferred to crystal lattice vibrations
via electron–phonon coupling on the time scale up to 10 ps.
A sudden release of thermal stress can create high-frequency coherent
acoustic phonons traveling inside the film as either longitudinal4,5 or transverse6 displacement waves. The
shape of the energy distribution throughout the film determines the
pattern of atomic displacements. Two extreme cases can be distinguished:
(i) if the thickness of the film is significantly larger than the
penetration length of the excitation laser pulse, the thermal stress
is localized near the thin-film surface. The stress field releases
a strain pulse twice as wide as the penetration depth and moving at
the speed of sound from the surface to the substrate interface. In
the opposite regime (ii), the film thickness is small compared to
the penetration depth of the exciting laser pulse, and the film will
experience a nearly uniform thermal stress after excitation. Then,
the traveling pulse is wider than the film thickness. Hence, it is
represented by a strain step moving at the speed of sound through
the film, dividing two regions with uniform, but different strains.
In both cases, (i) and (ii), the moving strain field bounces back
and forth within the thin film by reflection at the interfaces of
the thin film. While it experiences a phase shift of π and no
significant damping at the interface to air, reflection at the film–substrate
interface contains information about the substrate material and possible
interfacial layers.7,8 If the film is strongly bound
to a harder substrate, the strain wave is reflected without a phase
shift. In this case, the phase of the wave is restored after two reflections
at each interface, that is, after traveling a distance of four times
the film thickness.4 Strain waves in thin
films have previously been studied by the change of reflectivity of
optical light,5 probed indirectly by the
first-order perturbation of the material permittivity.9−12 Quantitative measurements of the displacement are therefore only
possible with prior knowledge of the photoelastic constants of the
investigated material. Time-resolved X-ray scattering techniques have
been successfully used to obtain the exact atomic displacements and
thus the shape of the light-induced strain waves.13−17 Their nanometer-sized shape is not discernible by
optical wavelengths. We demonstrate that time-resolved grazing incidence
X-ray diffraction (GIXD) directly measures the displacement waves
in molecular organic films to a detail that allows us to distinguish
between different excitation mechanisms. There have been a number
of recent time-resolved X-ray studies of phonon dynamics in inorganic
materials,18 but herein the focus is on
how the organic matter is impacted by light. The light–solid
matter interactions of the organic material are central and have been
addressed in previous studies involving femtosecond lasers19 but rarely with time-resolved diffraction.

2 Results and Discussion
Thin films of perylene were
chosen as a model system. The films consist of micrometer-sized crystallites
of the monoclinic α-perylene polymorph20 (space group P21/a)
with the a- and b-axis in the plane
of the glass substrate and the c-axis thus inclined
with respect to the surface plane by β = 100:55°, as determined
by GIXD21 (Figure 1a). This geometry gives rise to anisotropic
thermoelastic properties including a thermally induced shear movement
in the monoclinic angle β.22 After
optical excitation to the S1 state (above 2.6 eV), α-perylene
quickly undergoes structural relaxation to a trapped dimer state.23 The excess vibrational energy is released within
less than 1 ps,24 making coherent excitation
of acoustic waves possible. Time-resolved optical reflectivity measurements
showed two different strain waves propagating at different speeds,
955 and 4460 m/s (see the Supporting Information). The observed values match the speed of sound of the corresponding
transverse acoustic (TA) and longitudinal acoustic (LA) modes in single
crystals.25

a thin polycrystalline film of perylene in detector pixel units (to
remain as close to the raw data as possible). The beam center is at
(266, 201), and the (horizontal) sample horizon can be discerned near
the horizontal axis. Upper inset: Difference of diffraction patterns
taken at positive (+600 ps) and negative X-ray probe pulse time delay,
showing a small shift of peak positions. Lower inset: Monocline α-perylene
unit cell with parameters a = 11:277 Å, b = 10:826 Å, c = 10:263 Å, and
β = 100:55°. (b) Transient changes of the peak area, position,
and width of the reflection in the Qz-direction, relative to the unexcited state. The
shaded areas represent 90% Student’s t-distribution
certainty intervals from five repeated measurements.

Time-resolved GIXD measurements were carried out
at the optical pump/X-ray probe setup beamline ID09b at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).26 Thin-film samples of 3 × 3 mm2 size
were excited by Ti:sapphire laser pulses of 390 nm wavelength and
approximately 100 fs pulse length with angles of incidence of 10°
[case (i)] as well as 90° [case (ii)] with respect to the film
surface. The thin-film structure after laser excitation was probed
by 100 ps short X-ray pulses of 15 and 18 keV at an incidence angle
of 0.3°. The time-resolved GIXD signal shows lattice distortions
through individual shifts ΔQz of all Bragg reflections along the surface normal of the film
(Figure 1a, inset).
These shifts are relatively long-lived with a lifetime of 1–2
μs (data not shown), superposed by smaller amplitude oscillations
until about 10 ns after excitation (Figures 1b and 3).

The
integrated Bragg peak intensity, governed by the unit cell structure
factor, remains unchanged, suggesting that no structural relaxations
occur within the unit cell. This excludes the trapped dimer state
as the origin of the lattice distortions. The transient positions
of 16 most intense Bragg reflections were used for refining the average
changes of the unit cell parameters in the entire probed film volume.
Knowing the transient unit cell changes gives access to the average
transient strain in the film (Figure 2), which exhibits an expansion in direction perpendicular
to the surface (z-direction) superposed by a coherently
oscillating shear motion in direction of the unit cell’s a-axis (x-direction). The oscillation period T is related to the speed of sound cTA of the corresponding shear mode by T =
4d/cTA,4 in agreement with the speed of sound found by optical reflectivity
and the measured film thickness of d = 700 nm as
measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Coherent oscillations of
the faster longitudinal mode could not be resolved. The average transient
strain within the observed time range, 0–4 ns, shows similar
relative values as the static thermal strain (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Transient changes of strain components εij = δui/δxj (left scale) averaged over the entire measured perylene film
of 700 nm thickness. The transient strain was obtained from a unit
cell refinement to Bragg peak positions recorded with monochromatic
X-rays. The shaded areas represent 90% Student’s t-distribution certainty intervals of the mean strain determined from
five repeated measurements. The dashed horizontal lines represent
the corresponding components of the static thermal displacement gradient
tensor as labeled on the right side (scale to the right; data measured
from the same sample at beamline BW2, HASYLAB).

Together with the long lifetime of the strain and the time-independent
structure factor, this emphasizes the thermal origin of the transient
observations.

The X-ray diffraction signal from a distorted
crystal, in the kinematical approximation, is given by the sum of
phase factors of all diffracting unit cells in the scattering material.27 Small distortions from the periodic structure
lead to changes in the vicinity of Bragg reflections.28 As the main strain components, δux = δz and δuz = δz (where ux and uz are components of the three-dimensional
displacement u), do not change the distances in the ab-plane of the crystal, the Bragg peak profiles only change
in Qz. Figure 3 shows the transient changes of the peak shape of the 2̅21-reflection
that is the reflection with the most significant chance in the Qz-direction, obtained from
two experiments with different excitation light penetration depths
relative to the film thickness (see the Supporting Information). In case (i), where μ < d (Figure 3a), the
peak shape exhibits a complex temporal behavior, whereas in case (ii),
where μ > d, only the positions of the Bragg
peaks show significant transient changes (Figure 3b). While the latter case can be approximately
described by oscillatory changes in the lattice parameters of the
entire X-ray probed sample volume, a more complex distortion model
is needed to describe the former case. To that end, the detailed peak
profile was simulated (cf. Supporting Information). Both nonzero strain components are time-dependent functions of
the depth z and were calculated in a mechanical model
using the formalism established by Thomsen et al.,12 assuming a thermal stress field exponentially decaying
with z. The transient changes of the simulated and
measured peak profiles were both parameterized using an asymmetric
peak profile (“split Pearson VII”29) and could thus be directly compared (cf. Figure 3 for global fits) (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Data: Transient changes
of the reflection width and position in the Qz-direction, measured from two different α-perylene
films at different experimental conditions: (a) film thickness 700
nm/d = 0.17 and (b) film thickness 300 nm/d = 2.16. Error bars represent 90% Student’s t-distribution certainty intervals of the parameter mean
determined from two and six repeated measurements in cases (a,b),
respectively. Solid lines: Fit of modeled X-ray diffraction data from
an α-perylene crystal, distorted by a strain wave as described
by a classical mechanic model. The peak profiles were parameterized
by split Pearson VII functions29 (the curves
of remaining parameters are shown in the Supporting Information). The transient time delay is expressed in units
of the propagation time of a TA wave from the film surface to the
substrate interface d/cTA. Both datasets were acquired with polychromatic X-radiation (3%
BW). Insets: Schematic α-perylene crystallite column distorted
by the displacement fields fitted to either measured films at different
points of time (displacement exaggerated by a factor of 200). Dashed
lines: at times tcTA/d > 0 indicate the crystal position in the ground state. The red
contrast represents the thermal energy dissipated at time zero by
light excitation (color version online; animated movie in the Supporting Information). The fitted shear strain
component is shown to the right of the columns with tcTA/d > 0.

Considering the simplicity of the model, the fits produce
a remarkably good agreement with the observed feature-rich peak shape
changes. The fit results show coherent strain pulses up to an amplitude
of 3 × 10–3 and a bandwidth of 1 GHz, making
up a displacement of the order of 5 Å for the crystal surface.
The wave packet spectrum of the strain pulse in case (i) (Figure 3, inset) is rather
broad and accordingly affects the shape of the Bragg peak as seen
in the rise of peak width. The strain profile in case (ii) is more
uniform and hence does not lead to a similar increase in peak width
but still shifts the Bragg peak. In both measurements shown in Figure 3, the refined reflection
coefficient of the transverse wave at the film–substrate interface
is 0.7, in good agreement with the expected value of 0.64 for a perfectly
coupled α-perylene–glass interface as calculated from
the acoustic impedances of both materials. The acoustic impedance Z = ρcs was calculated
from the speed of sound cTA measured by
optical reflectivity and the density ρ. The tabulated values
were used for glass.

The refined values of the penetration depth
of the excitation light, 140 and 610 nm, differ from the expected
values assuming linear light absorption, 570 and 750 nm, for the cases
(i) and (ii), respectively.

This supports the presence of nonlinear
and two-photon absorption. Further evidence for this interpretation
is given by the fact that the excitation pulse fluence used in the
time-resolved GIXD experiment (approx. 3.5 and 15.3 mJ/cm2) was above the threshold reported for the linear increase of fluorescence
with increasing excitation fluence (1.5 mJ/cm2).30 In future more detailed models, one could consider
including stress profiles of a more complex nature than the exponential
decay.

3 Conclusions
We have determined the
detailed transverse atomic displacement wave profile in perylene thin
films and demonstrated that the form of the strain wave can be controlled
via the ratio between the excitation depth and the film thickness.
The accurate atomic displacements of the TA waves were measured by
time-resolved GIXD and fitted by a thermoelastic model including the
absorption depth of the excitation light with the focus being on the
organic layer. The reflection of the TA wave at the film–substrate
interface was shown to be determined by the mechanical properties
of most likely both materials, suggesting a direct mechanic contact
without an interfacial layer. This time-resolved X-ray approach to
light-induced distortion in materials does reach far beyond perylene
and will certainly prove very valuable for charge transport mechanisms
that are key in, for example, perovskites and other optoelectronic
materials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample
Preparation
Thin films of perylene were grown by vapor deposition
on microscope glass slides at deposition rates of 0.2–0.4 mm/s
to thicknesses ranging from 100 to 1000 nm.

The linear light
absorption coefficients of the films were measured using an optical
microscope equipped with a fiber spectrometer. The effective penetration
depths in the linear absorption regime were calculated from the absorption
coefficients, also including refraction at the film surface.

4.2 Static Strain Measurements
The thermal expansion coefficients
in the temperature range 20–60 °C were determined by temperature-dependent
GIXD measurements at beamline BW2, HASYLAB.

4.3 Time-Resolved
GIXD
Time-resolved GIXD measurements were carried out at
the optical pump/X-ray probe setup beamline ID09b at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).26 Thin-film samples of 3 il3 mm2 size were excited by Ti:sapphire
laser pulses of 390 nm wavelength and ∼100 fs pulse length
with angles of incidence of 10° [case (i)] as well as 90°
[case (ii)] with respect to the film surface.

The thin-film
structure after laser excitation was probed by 100 ps short X-ray
pulses of 15 and 18 keV at an incidence angle of 0.3°, sufficiently
above the critical angle of SiO2 to prevent additional
diffraction from X-rays which are totally reflected from the film
substrate. The diffraction signal from the stroboscopically repeated
pump–probe experiment was integrated on a charge-coupled device
area detector while rotating the thin-film sample around the surface
normal (10°/s) during exposure in order to average the signal
from a large number of crystallites in the X-radiated footprint.

4.4 Mechanical Modeling
The transient displacement
model described by Thomsen et al.12 was
applied independently for both longitudinal and transversal displacements
in the c*-direction of the α-perylene unit
cell. The amplitudes of the waves reflected from the film–substrate
interface were reduced according to the reflection coefficients calculated
from the acoustic impedances of the materials at the interface, characteristic
for a direct mechanical coupling. Changes of the thermal stress field
due to thermal diffusion were ignored, as they occur on much longer
timescales. The ratio of the time-averaged strain after excitation
was fixed to the measured ratio of (∂ux/∂z)/(∂uz/∂z) = −2.0 (as seen in Figure 2).

The transient changes of the X-ray diffraction
peaks were modeled by applying the spatial displacements ux and uz to the lattice sum of phase factors from unperturbed ab lattice planes. The resulting profile, a function of
the z-component Qz of the wave vector transfer Q, was convoluted
with a broad peak profile, accounting for the alignment distribution
of crystallites in the film and for the instrumental resolution function.
The resulting profile was analyzed by a split Pearson VII profile29 and compared to the measured profile in the Qz-direction.

The experimental
data shown in Figure 3 were χ2-fitted by the modeled data, taking into
account the peak shape parameters by a split Pearson VII while refining
the penetration depth of the excitation light, the reflection coefficient rTA of the TA wave at the film–substrate
interface, the strain amplitude, and the fraction of the excited sample
volume. The speeds of sound of the LA and TA waves were fixed at the
values determined by transient optical reflectivity. The film thickness
was fixed at the values determined by the observed oscillatory features
in the GIXD data, giving a value inside the uncertainty limits of
the thickness measurements by AFM. The reflection coefficient rLA was set to the expected value of a perfectly
coupled α-perylene–glass interface (0.34), calculated
from the acoustic impedance and using tabulated values for the mass
density of both materials.
