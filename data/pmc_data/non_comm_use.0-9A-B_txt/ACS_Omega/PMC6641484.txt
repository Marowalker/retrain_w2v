A hierarchically
porous zirconia (ZrO2) monolith was
successfully fabricated by using bacterial cellulose (BC) as a biotemplate
and preceramic polymer as a zirconium resource, via freeze-drying
and two-step calcination process. Images of scanning electron microscopy
showed that the ZrO2 monolith well-replicated a three-dimensional
reticulated structure of pristine BC and possessed good morphology
stability till 1100 °C in air. Results of N2 adsorption/desorption
and mercury porosimetry analysis revealed the hierarchically porous
structure and large specific area (9.7 m2·g–1) of the ZrO2 monolith, respectively. Patterns of X-ray
powder diffraction indicated that the monoclinic phase and tetragonal
phase coexisted in the ZrO2 monolith with the former as
the main phase. In addition, the ZrO2 monolith possessed
low bulk density (0.13 g·cm–3) and good mechanical
strength. These properties suggest that the as-prepared ZrO2 monolith has a great potential to serve as an ideal catalyst or
catalyst support.

1 Introduction
Porous
zirconia (ZrO2) ceramics have been widely applied
in various areas, such as filters,1,2 catalysts,3−6 catalyst supports,7−12 solid oxide fuel cells,13−16 sensors,17−21 and thermal barriers.22−24 In the case of catalysts and
catalyst supports, the hierarchically porous monoliths with good pore
connectivity are desired because they can simultaneously provide catalysts
and catalyst supports with large specific area, fast mass-transfer
ability, and easy separation ability.25−29 Previously, porous silica monoliths with hierarchical
structures have been fabricated by various methods including sol–gel,
emulsion, colloidal crystal templating, and ice templating, attributed
to the ease of controlling the hydrolysis and polycondensation of
silicon alkoxides.30 In contrast, zirconium
alkoxides are highly reactive, making the hydrolysis and polycondensation
difficult to control. Konishi et al.31 successfully
prepared ZrO2 monolith with well-defined macro-/mesopores
by combining sol–gel, poly(ethylene oxide)-induced phase separation,
and solvothermal process, but the complexity of this technique will
hinder practical applications. Alternatively, the ZrO2 monolith
can be fabricated by the nanocasting method accompanied with silica
or polymer templates.32,33 However, silica templates were
recalcitrant to be removed even with HF etching. When polymer templates
were employed, samples displayed poor mechanical strength and were
easy to crack. The high price of silica and polymer templates will
also become an issue for practical applications. Therefore, a facile
and cost-effective method to fabricate hierarchically porous zirconia
monolith is still in urgent demand.

Bacterial cellulose (BC)
as a bio-based polymer has attracted much
attention because of its renewability, low cost, unique structure,
and excellent mechanical properties.34 It
is an extracellular product of bacteria (normally Acetobacter
xylinum), possessing a three-dimensional (3D) reticulate
structure which was constructed by ultrafine cellulose fibers (less
than 130 nm).35−37 It is expected to be an excellent natural template
with the desired hierarchically porous structure. On the basis of
BC, many novel materials have been designed and realized, such as
bio-based composites,38 adsorbents,39 conductors,40,41 capacitors,42−45 sensors,46 displaying materials,47,48 fuel cells,49,50 and scaffolds for tissue engineering.37,51 Metal oxide (MO)/BC composites were prepared by directly mixing
MO nanoparticles and BC or by hydro-/solvothermal treatment of small-molecule
precursors of MO in the presence of BC.52 These MO/BC composites retaining the fine microstructure of BC can
be formed at relatively low temperature. However, the complete and
uniform coating was difficult to achieve because MO will aggregate
on the surface of cellulose fibers in the form of particles. Their
3D reticulate structure will inevitably collapse during the calcination
process at high temperature because of the removal of cellulose fibers.

In recent decades, a series of preceramic polymers containing silicon
(Si), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), boron (B), aluminum (Al), titanium
(Ta), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), and so forth have
been successfully developed. These preceramic polymers possess precise
composition, complex structure, and excellent processability. Through
curing and calcination, they can be converted to various types of
ceramics such as SiO2, SiC, SiCO, Si3N4, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2,
HfC, TaC, ZrC/SiC, and HfB2/HfC/SiC/C composite ceramics.53−60 In our previous work, a thin layer of N-doped TiO2 catalyst
was successfully formed on the surface of quartz fabrics by the preceramic
polymer route, showing high photocatalytic activity.61 In the light of excellent film-forming properties of preceramic
polymers, a complete and uniform coating is possible to form on the
surface of cellulose fibers and transform to corresponding ceramic
nanofibers through calcination, eventually replicating the 3D reticulate
structure of BC.

In this work, a novel method to fabricate hierarchically
porous
zirconia monolith, by using BC as a bio-based template and a preceramic
polymer as a zirconium resource, was proposed and optimized. Morphology,
crystalline structure, specific area, pore diameter distribution,
and mechanical properties of samples were systematically investigated.
The as-prepared hierarchically porous zirconia monolith may have great
potential applications in catalyst and catalyst support areas.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Route and Mechanism for
the Fabrication of
Porous ZrO2 Monolith
BC as well as preceramic
polymer played an important role on the fabrication of porous ZrO2 monolith, by serving as the 3D reticulate biotemplate and
provider of zirconium resource, respectively. To obtain intact ZrO2 monolith that preserved the fine microstructure of BC, there
were several crucial procedures to be followed (Figure 1). In the initial stage, suitable concentration
of preceramic polymer solution need to be chosen because high concentration
(>0.1 g·mL–1) will lead to coalescence of
fine
microstructure (Figure S1) and low concentration
(<0.02 g·mL–1) will cause poor mechanical
strength and dramatic shrinkage of final ZrO2 monolith.
After a series of screening experiments, the concentration was fixed
to 0.06 g·mL–1 and all of the following experiments
were based on this concentration.

Figure 1 Route and mechanism for the fabrication
of porous zirconia monolith.

A light yellow BCZr hydrogel was prepared by the immersion
procedure
(Figure 1), during
which the interstice water of pristine BC hydrogel was replaced by
preceramic polymer solution. When the BCZr hydrogel was frozen in
liquid N2, ice crystals were formed. Meanwhile, the preceramic
polymer was precipitated from the solution and expelled to the boundary
between BC fibers and ice crystals. Subsequently, ice crystals were
removed by sublimation in the freeze-drying process to avoid collapse
of 3D reticulate structure of pristine BC, leaving the preceramic
polymer to attach to the surface of BC fibers. During curing at 200
°C, the preceramic polymer was fixed on the surface of BC fibers
through chemical reactions between preceramic polymer and hydroxyl
groups of BC. The bulk density (Table 1) of the as-obtained yellow BCZr-dry monolith (Figure 2) was 0.06 g·cm–3, obviously higher than that (0.01 g·cm–3) of BC-dry (freeze-dried pristine BC) monolith because of the successful
incorporation of preceramic polymer. For comparison, the preceramic
polymer solution was directly treated by freeze-drying without the
participation of BC. However, no intact monolith could be obtained,
and samples cracked into small pieces, as shown in Figure S2. This phenomenon revealed the strengthening effect
of BC on the preceramic polymer.

a The shrinkage of
BC-dry and BCZr
samples in the length direction was calculated corresponding to the
BC hydrogel and BCZr hydrogel, respectively.

b Weight loss of BCZr samples was
calculated corresponding to the weight of BCZr-dry.

BC was a kind of carbohydrate polymer,
and the preceramic polymer
also contained a large amount of organic component. During the pyrolysis
process in air, both of them will release extensive fugitive gas and
result in dramatic shrinkage of samples, causing irreversible damage
to the morphology and properties of final porous ZrO2 monolith.
Thus, the two-step calcination process was employed to delicately
control pyrolysis of BC and preceramic polymer. In the first step,
Ar was used as protecting and carrier gas, accompanying with a slow
heating rate of 1 °C·min–1. After treatment
at 800 °C for 1 h, an intact black monolith BCZr-800–Ar
(Figure 2) with a bulk
density of 0.1 g·cm–3 and a linear shrinkage
of 31% was obtained. The black color derived from residual carbon
which was generated by the pyrolysis of BC and preceramic polymer.
Carbon fibers in the inner layer generated from BC may enhance the
strength of the monolith, and free carbon in the outer layer generated
from the preceramic polymer may function as a binder to hold ceramic
particles together during the shrinking process. In the second step,
BCZr-800–Ar was calcined again in air atmosphere at 800 °C
to remove residual carbon, accompanying with a small linear shrinkage
of 4%. Finally, a white porous ZrO2 monolith BCZr-800–air
with a low bulk density of 0.13 g·cm−3 was
obtained. When a 50 g of weight was loaded, the ZrO2 monolith
still remained intact, suggesting that the ZrO2 monolith
possessed good mechanical strength. After treatment at 1100 °C
for 1 h, linear shrinkage and bulk density of BCZr-1100–air
showed a slight increase from 35 to 36% and from 0.13 to 0.16 g·cm−3, respectively, revealing that the ZrO2 monolith possessed excellent size stability at high temperature.

Through immersion, freeze-drying, curing, and two-step calcination
process, the ZrO2 monolith with intact shape, low bulk
density, good mechanical strength, and excellent size stability was
successfully prepared.

2.2 Morphology Evolution
The morphology
of samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From Figure 3a,b, we can clearly
see that BC-dry had a 3D homogeneous reticulated structure that was
constructed by interweaved cellulose fibers with a diameter of around
30–50 nm. After immersion, freeze-drying, and curing procedures
(Figure 1), a complete
and uniform layer of preceramic polymer was coated on the surface
of BC fibers (Figure 3c,d) because of the excellent film-forming properties of preceramic
polymer. When the preceramic polymer solution was directly freeze-dried
in the absence of BC, big pores with a pillar structure and a diameter
of 5–10 μm were exhibited (Figure S2). It was obviously different from the small and uniform
pore structure in the presence of BC. The reason may be that in the
absence of BC, the preceramic polymer was expelled to the boundary
between big ice crystals. After sublimation of ice crystals, the porous
structure inherited from the ice template was formed, whereas in the
presence of BC, the front edge of ice crystals bypassed BC fibers
and continued to move forward during the growth process. The preceramic
polymer in the front edge of ice crystals, instead of being expelled
to the boundary of ice crystals, attached to the surface of BC fibers
and formed a thin layer of coating. When ice crystals were removed,
small and uniform pores inherited from BC were created. Therefore,
BC not only enhanced the strength of the preceramic polymer to avoid
crack during freezing but also functioned as a biotemplate to aid
the formation of 3D reticulate porous structure.

(c,d) BCZr-dry, (e,f) BCZr-800–Ar,
(g,h) BCZr-800–air, and (i,j) BCZr-1100–air.

There was a substantial weight loss (36 wt %) occurring
after the
first calcination process, but the 3D reticulate structure was well-preserved
(Figure 3e,f) because
of the strengthening effects of carbon. The unique structure of BC
still remained after the second calcination process, except for displaying
a little difference that small particles with a diameter of 10–30
nm appeared on the surface of fibers (Figure 3g,h), attributed to the growth of ZrO2 crystals after removing free carbon. At this time, ZrO2 particles had been sintered and connected to each other,
making ZrO2 nanofibers strong enough to sustain the 3D
reticulate structure even without the strengthening effects of residual
carbon. The diameter of ZrO2 crystals continued to grow
to 30–100 nm (Figure 3j,k) after treatment at 1100 °C for 1 h with the 3D reticulate
structure still remaining. This revealed the excellent morphology
stability of the as-obtained ZrO2 monolith at high temperature.

It was clear that the ZrO2 monolith well replicated
the 3D reticulate structure of the BC template and was constructed
by interweaved ZrO2 nanofibers. Moreover, the ZrO2 monolith exhibited excellent morphology stability at high temperature.

2.3 Crystalline Structure Investigation
BC-dry
showed main characteristic peaks at 2θ = 14.8°,
16.3°, and 22.7° (Figure 4a), which were assigned to the cellulose I structure.62 After the incorporation of preceramic polymer,
BCZr-dry showed a wide amorphous peak (Figure 4b) because of that the peaks of crystalline
BC were covered by signals of amorphous preceramic polymer. After
the first calcination process, sharp peaks belonging to the tetragonal
phase of ZrO2 crystals (PDF card no. 50-1089) appeared
in Figure 4c and the
average size of ZrO2 crystals was calculated as 10 nm according
to the Scherrer equation. In the case of BCZr-800–Ar, carbon
functioned as an impurity to inhibit the growth of ZrO2 crystals and meanwhile as the phase stabilizer to stabilize the
tetragonal phase. Once carbon was removed from samples, most of the
tetragonal phase would transform to monoclinic phase during cooling
process. As shown in Figure 4d, the main phase of ZrO2 crystals in BCZr-800–air
was monoclinic phase (PDF card no. 24-1165) and the average size of
ZrO2 crystals was calculated as 16 nm, which matched well
with the SEM observation results. When samples were treated in air
at 1100 °C for 1 h, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of BCZr-1100–air
showed much sharper signals compared to that of BCZr-800–air,
indicating the further increase of ZrO2 crystals. The average
size of ZrO2 crystals was calculated as 32 nm. The above
results revealed that the as-prepared monolith was composed of typical
ZrO2 nanocrystals.

2.4 N2 Adsorption/Desorption
and Mercury
Porosimetry Analysis
N2 adsorption/desorption
results (Figure S3) of BC-dry displayed
a typical type II isotherm, indicating that it was mainly composed
of macropores. The large specific surface area (102.5 m2·g–1) originated from the surfaces of the
cellulose nanofibers. After the incorporation of preceramic polymer,
BCZr-dry showed a combination of type I and type II isotherms (Figure S4). The pronounced adsorption at low P/P0 indicated that the samples
contained micropores, which might originate from voids of coating
and were responsible for the increase of specific area (121.6 m2·g–1). After the first calcination
process, the specific area (19 m2·g–1) of BCZr-800–Ar showed a sharp decrease because of the shrinkage
of the skeleton during the calcination process. After the removal
of carbon, the specific area of BCZr-800–air decreased to 9.7
m2·g–1 because of the further shrinkage
of the skeleton and the growth of ZrO2 crystals after carbon
was removed. The similar phenomenon occurred for BCZr-1100–air
because of the same reason. Although calcined samples showed different
specific areas and pore volumes, they all demonstrated obvious adsorption
at low P/P0 and hysteresis
loops (Figure 5), indicating
the coexistence of micropores and mesopores in their structure, which
originated from the voids between ZrO2 particles. Moreover,
the results (Figure 6) of mercury porosimetry clearly revealed the existence of macropores,
which originated from the BC scaffold and can be observed in the SEM
images (Figure 3).
Therefore, it was reasonable to deduce that all of the calcined samples
possessed hierarchically porous structure.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully fabricated a hierarchically porous ZrO2 monolith by using BC as a biotemplate and preceramic polymer
as a zirconium resource, via the freeze-drying and two-step calcination
process. The hierarchical structure will endow the ZrO2 monolith with fast mass-transfer ability and large space for chemical
reactions. Monolithic properties and good mechanical strength of ZrO2 monolith will ease the usage and recycling. Excellent morphology
stability under high temperature will facilitate the regeneration
of ZrO2 monolith. The above advantages suggest that the
as-prepared ZrO2 monolith will have important applications
for catalyst or catalyst support. In addition, the general method
developed in this work can be used to fabricate other MO systems.
In our next paper, we will employ this method to fabricate hierarchically
porous TiO2 monolith, which could serve as a highly efficient
photocatalyst.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Purified BC sheets with
a thickness of 1.5 cm biosynthesized by A. xylinum were kindly offered by Ms C. Y. Zhong (Hainan Yeguo Foods Co., Ltd.,
Haikou, China). The preceramic polymer aqueous solution (solid content
≈ 34 wt %, zirconium content ≈ 22 wt %) was obtained
from Tunable Materials Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China. The preceramic polymer
was synthesized with zirconium(IV) propoxide as the starting material
and a certain amount of acetylacetone and acetic acid as chelating
agents. The synthesis procedure was described elsewhere in detail.63 The above raw materials and other reagents were
used as received without further treatment.

4.2 Preparation
of Porous Composite Monolith of
BC and Preceramic Polymer
First, BC hydrogel was cut into
small pieces with the rectangle shape and immersed into 0.06 g·mL–1 (concocted according to the solid content) of preceramic
polymer solution and then kept for 48 h to ensure that the preceramic
polymer solution was homogeneously dispersed into the BC hydrogel.
Afterward, the hydrogel-containing preceramic polymer solution (BCZr
hydrogel) was transferred to a plastic container and frozen in liquid
N2 for 15 min, followed by freeze-drying for 48 h and curing
at 200 °C for 2 h. The as-obtained sample (BCZr-dry) was placed
in a desiccator to avoid the adsorption of moisture.

4.3 Preparation of Porous ZrO2 Monolith
To fabricate
a porous ZrO2 monolith, two steps of calcination
process were employed. During the first calcination process, argon
(Ar) was used as protecting and carrier gas and the programmed temperature
[room temperature (RT) → 300 °C/1 h → 800 °C/1
h with a heating rate of 1 °C·min–1] was
exerted on the samples. The obtained sample was referred to as BCZr-800–Ar.
In the second calcination process, BCZr-800–Ar was calcined
again under the programmed temperature (RT → 800 °C/1
h with a heating rate of 1 °C·min–1) in
air atmosphere. The obtained sample was referred to as BCZr-800–air.
To examine the high-temperature stability, BCZr-800–air was
heated from RT to 1100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1 and kept at 1100 °C for 1 h. The prepared sample
was referred to as BCZr-1100–air.

4.4 Characterization
and Instruments
A scanning electron microscope (HITACHI SU8020,
Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan) was used to observe the morphology of samples. XRD measurements
were performed on a powder diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX 2500, Rigaku
Co., Tokyo, Japan) using a Cu/Kα radiation (40 kV, 200 mA, λ
= 1.54056 Å). The specimens were continuously scanned from 3°
to 90° (2θ) at a speed of 8°·min–1. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at
77 K on a surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020,
Micromeritics Instrument Co., Norcross, GA, USA). Mercury porosimetry
(AutoPore-IV9510, Micromeritics Instrument Co., USA) was used to analyze
the pore size distribution. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry
(Variant, Vista-MPX, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) was employed
to measure the content of zirconium. The carbon content was measured
by a carbon/sulfur analyzer (LECO CS-444LS, LECO Co., Saint Joseph,
MI, USA). The bulk density was calculated based on the Archimedes
principle.
