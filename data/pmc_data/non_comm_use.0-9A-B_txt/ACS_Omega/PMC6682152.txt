We
report the development of pH-labile ascorbic acid-coated magnetic
nanocarriers (AMNCs) for effective delivery of the anticancer drug
doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) to tumor cells. The uniqueness of
this drug delivery system lies in the covalent conjugation of DOX
through carbamate and hydrazone bonds, resulting in a slow and sustained
drug release profile at different environmental acidities. X-ray diffraction
and transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the formation
of crystalline single-phase Fe3O4 nanoparticles
with an average size of 10 nm. The changes in the interfacial characteristics
of the nanocarriers and the presence of organic coatings are probed
by infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential,
and thermogravimetric measurements. AMNCs show high colloidal stability
in aqueous and cell culture media and possess good magnetic field
responsivity and protein resistance characteristics. The drug-loaded
nanocarriers exhibited sustained pH-triggered release of drug molecules
in acidic mediums, substantial cellular internalization, and significant
toxicity toward the proliferation of mouse skin fibrosarcoma (WEHI-164),
human breast cancer (MCF-7), and human lung cancer (A549) cells. However,
it showed significantly lower toxicity in human normal lung (WI26VA)
cells. Overall, these results suggest a pH-sensitive drug release
of nanoformulations, which showed selective toxicity to tumor than
normal cells.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Conventional
chemotherapies for cancer suffer from the disadvantage
of toxicity to normal cells and nonspecific biodistribution, leading
to toxicities to organs like livers, kidneys, and so forth.1 Targeting of the drug to the tumors can be achieved
by incorporating the active ingredient in suitable nanostructured
materials with desired size, charge, and surface characteristics.2 Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) conjugated with
drugs have been assessed as a strategy to deliver anticancer agents
to tumor sites.3 In addition to the targeting
capability, most of these nanocarriers solve other limitations of
conventional drug delivery systems in terms of solubility, systemic
toxicity, and drug degradation. The rationale behind this approach
is to increase efficacy, while reducing systemic side-effects.

Among others, superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles
are widely favored because of biocompatibility, unique physiochemical
properties, and reactive surfaces that can be readily modified by
functionalizing with suitable surface-passivating agents.4−7 Another advantage of using Fe3O4 MNPs as nanocarriers
is that they are biodegradable through the iron metabolism pathway.
An important step in developing such nanocarriers is to modify the
surface of Fe3O4 MNPs with suitable organic/inorganic
species that have targeting sites, pH-sensitive moieties, and ability
to conjugate drugs/biomarkers.7−12 Ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most essential vitamins for both
pharmaceutical and food-processing industries. It contains four −OH
groups (two enol −OH groups on lactone ring carbons and two
−OH groups on the side chain C atoms) and a carbonyl group
(lactone ring carbons). AA as well as its oxidized product dehydroascorbic
acid (DHA) act as good capping agents because of the chemical interaction
of its carbonyl group with metal ions.13−15 AA is highly water-soluble
and it shows strong antioxidant properties16,17 and hence, significant interest lies in preparing highly water-dispersible
Fe3O4 MNPs using AA as a capping agent for biomedical
applications. Sreeja et al. and Gupta et al. reported the magnetic
resonance contrast properties of AA- and DHA-coated MNPs, respectively.13,14 However, the drug delivery capability of AA-conjugated nanoparticles
is not explored. AA is transported into cells in DHA form via the
glucose transporter (GLUT) protein.18 Enhanced
GLUT expression has been reported in various cancers such as hepatic,
breast, pancreatic, brain, renal, esophageal, lung, colorectal, endometrial,
cutaneous, cervical and ovarian carcinoma, and so forth.19 Therefore, higher intracellular delivery of
anticancer drugs can be achieved by using AA-conjugated nanoparticles
as drug carriers. Further, DHA can cross the blood brain barrier by
GLUT120 and thus, AA-conjugated nanoparticles
can also be useful for brain drug delivery. Although many noncovalent
approaches have been employed for delivering anticancer drugs, the
in vivo stability of the drug delivery system constructed using a
noncovalent method is still challenging. The drug delivery systems
formed by covalent approaches (via chemical bonds) provide more stability
to drugs as well as their selective release than those constructed
using noncovalent linkages.21−25 In this aspect, polymer–drug conjugates are extensively developed
by using pH-labile chemical bonds such as hydrazone, cisacotinyl,
carbamate, and acetal bonds.26−28 The presence of acid-labile linkages
between drugs and polymeric carriers permits drug release either in
the mild acidic extracellular environment of a tumor or after endocytosis
in endosomes or lysosomes in tumor cells.

Herein, we report
development of pH-labile magnetic nanocarriers
for effective delivery of anticancer drug, DOX, to tumor cells. DOX
was covalently bound to the ascorbic acid-coated magnetic nanocarriers
(AMNCs) through carbamate and hydrazone linkage (Scheme 1). The developed drug–nanocarrier
conjugate would minimize the amounts of drug leaching out in the blood
(pH 7.4) and enable drug release upon being internalized by the target
cells (pH 5). It is noteworthy to mention that these colloidally stable,
pH-sensitive nanocarriers showed selective toxicity to tumor than
normal cells.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Magnetic
Property Studies
An X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 1a) confirmed the
formation of a single-phase
inverse cubic spinel Fe3O4 nanostructure. The
lattice constant was found to be 8.378 Å, which is very close
to the reported value of Fe3O4 (JCPDS card no.
88-0315, a = 8.375 Å). From X-ray line broadening,
the crystallite sizes were estimated to be ∼9.7 nm. A transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrograph (Figure 1b) also shows the formation of almost spherical-shaped
Fe3O4 nanoparticles of an average size of ∼9.5
nm (particle size distribution is shown in Figure S1a, Supporting Information). High-resolution TEM
(HRTEM) analysis confirmed that each particle is highly crystalline
and single-domain. The average interplanar distance (inset of Figure 1b) was measured to
be ∼0.30 nm, which corresponds to the (220) lattice plane of
Fe3O4.7 Further,
the selected area electron diffraction pattern (Figure S1b, Supporting Information) also confirmed the high
crystalline nature of AMNCs.

Figure 1 (a) XRD pattern and (b) TEM image (inset: HRTEM
image), (c) FTIR
spectra (along with pure AA) and (d) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
plot of AMNCs.

The successful conjugation
of AA on the surface of Fe3O4 MNPs is confirmed
by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
and thermal analyses. From the FTIR spectra (Figure 1c), it is seen that vibrational bands for
pure AA are prominently resolved, but those of AMNCs are relatively
broad and few. The intense peak that appeared at around 588 cm–1 in the spectra of AMNCs can be attributed to the
Fe–O vibration of Fe3O4 MNPs.7 AA exhibited bands at 1750, 1664, and 1322 cm–1 for C=O stretching of a five-member lactone
ring, C=C stretching vibrations coupled with the neighboring
vibrations along the conjugated system, and enol hydroxyl stretching
vibrations, respectively.15 The C=C
and enol hydroxyl stretching vibrations of AA also appeared in the
FTIR spectrum of AMNCs. The absence of an intense C=O stretching
band in AMNCs indicates that the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group
has coordinated with the Fe atoms of the MNPs surface (through C=O···Fe
interaction). This coordination is further confirmed by the appearance
of a new intense vibrational band at 1400 cm–1.
However, it is difficult to predict whether Fe is coordinated with
AA using one, two, or three of its C=O groups of the lactone
ring. The band appearing at 1125 and 1025 cm–1 in
pure AA can be associated with C–O groups of the lactone ring.14 These peaks appeared in the spectrum of AMNCs
with a slight shift in peak position. Further, the bands corresponding
to different hydroxyl groups of AA in the range of 3210–3527
cm–1 appeared as a broad band in the FTIR spectrum
of AMNCs. TGA (Figure 1d) showed a two-step decomposition of AMNCs with a total weight loss
of about 7%. The first step of weight loss up to 200 °C can be
ascribed to the removal of physically absorbed water and AA molecules,
whereas weight loss beyond this can be associated with removal of
chemically adsorbed AA and any chemisorbed water molecules, if present,
from the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Previous
studies indicate that bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles
prepared by a similar method without using any coating agent exhibit
about 2.5% weight loss owing to the removal of both physically and
chemically adsorbed water molecules.29 As
the total weight loss beyond 200 °C is much more than 2.5%, it
is inferred that there is a significant contribution from the decomposition
of chemisorbed AA. This supports efficient capping of Fe3O4 nanoparticles by AA molecules. It has been reported
that pure AA starts decomposing at about 191 °C and experiences
the maximum rate of decomposition at about 221 °C.30 This shifting of decomposition temperature to
higher degrees for AMNCs can be attributed to the chemical coordination
of AA with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The weight loss
observed by TGA was further supported by iron estimation (through
the phenanthroline spectrophotometric method),31 which showed that about 8% organic moieties are present
on the particle. Thus, FTIR and TGA provide a clear evidence of effective
capping of AA on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles.

Light scattering measurements were performed to determine the hydrodynamic
diameter and surface charge of these particles in aqueous medium.
From pH-dependent zeta potential measurements (Figure 2a), the point of zero charge (PZC) of AMNCs
was found to be around pH 2.8, whereas PZC of bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles is 6.7.32 It has
been found that AMNCs have a positive surface charge below their PZC,
whereas negative surface charge above PZC. This difference in their
charge characteristics may be attributed to the degree of ionization
of functional groups at different pH values. On the other hand, the
highly negative values of zeta potential of these nanoparticles in
water (−26.6 mV) and 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
(−26.0 mV) mediums also provide additional colloidal dispersibility
to these particles. Further, dynamic light scattering (DLS, inset
of Figure 2a) plot
showed that these particles form a stable aqueous colloidal dispersion
and have a mean number weighted hydrodynamic diameter of ∼40
nm. This is significantly larger than the core size obtained by XRD
and TEM. The observed higher hydrodynamic diameter is possibly due
to the presence of an associated and hydrated AA layer on the surface
of the particles. Further, the insignificant change in absorbance
of particle suspension (0.1 mg/mL) in aqueous (water) and cell culture
medium [Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with fetal
bovine serum] with time (even after 72 h) indicates their good colloidal
stability (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Thus, it can be predicted that the free hydroxyl groups of AA
extend into the water medium, providing a high degree of aqueous colloidal
stability to the particles. We also explored the interaction of AMNCs
with bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein in a physiological medium
(0.01 M PBS, pH 7.3). AMNCs do not show any significant change in
zeta potential (Table S1, Supporting Information) even after interacting with BSA for 2 h, revealing their protein
resistance characteristic in a physiological medium. This suggests
that the suspension of these nanocarriers is suitable for applications
under physiological conditions, which is essential for biomedical
applications.

Figure 2 (a) pH-dependent zeta potential plot (inset shows its
DLS plot
indicating the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles) and (b) room
temperature field dependence of magnetization (M vs H) plot of AMNCs (inset shows the photographs of its aqueous
suspension in the presence and absence of a magnetic field).

AMNCs exhibit superparamagnetic
behavior without magnetic hysteresis
and remanence (Figure 2b) at room temperature (RT). The maximum magnetization of AMNCs was
found to be 56 emu/g at 20 kOe, which is equivalent to 60.8% of the
bulk Fe3O4 (92 emu/g).33 This decrease in magnetization can be attributed to both nano-sized
Fe3O4 particles and random coating of AA on
their surface.34 However, the observed
magnetization is comparable to that of bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles (60.5 emu/g) obtained by the co-precipitation method,
reported earlier.35 A similar value of
maximum magnetization (67.6 emu/g) was obtained for bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles, prepared under similar conditions, without
any passivating agent.29 This further supports
the coating of organic molecules as revealed by TGA and Fe estimation.
In the presence of an external magnetic field (field strength of the
magnet used is ∼2.5 kOe), the opaque homogeneous dispersion
of AMNCs changed to a clear and transparent solution within a few
minutes (inset of Figure 2b). Thus, these water-dispersible Fe3O4 nanoparticles having a high magnetic response could be explored
for various biomedical applications.

2.2 Drug
Loading and Release Studies
The capability of AMNCs as a
drug carrier was investigated by covalently
conjugating the anticancer drug, DOX, through carbamate and hydrazone
linkages. The interaction of DOX molecules with AMNCs was evident
from the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the supernatant liquid
obtained after removal of the drug-loaded AMNCs through magnetic separation
(Figure 3a). The drug
loading efficiencies of 48 and 57% were obtained for AMNCs-CL-DOX
and AMNCs-HL-DOX, respectively, at DOX to particles’ ratio
of 1:10. A slightly higher loading efficiency was observed for hydrazone
linkage than carbamate linkage. As evident from Scheme S1 (Supporting Information), the conjugation of DOX
through carbamate linkage occurs through direct reaction between 4-nitrophenyl
chloroformate (NPC)-activated AMNCs and amine group of DOX, whereas
for hydrazone linkage it proceeds through a two-step reaction. In
the first step, the NPC-activated AMNCs react with hydrazine, forming
a nucleophilic substitution product. The easy accessibility of a less
bulky nucleophile in a two-step reaction as opposed to a single-step
process could significantly improve the yield of the reaction. This
could be the probable reason for higher loading of DOX observed during
hydrazone linkage. These pH-sensitive linkages (hydrazone and carbamate)
can be cleaved at mild acidic pH, and thus provide opportunities for
designing pH-responsive nanocarriers. The hydrodynamic diameter and
surface charges of drug-loaded AMNCs were also investigated as these
parameters are important criteria for drug delivery and provided in Table 1 along with those
of AMNCs. Further, TEM images of drug-loaded AMNCs confirmed the insignificant
change in morphology of AMNCs after conjugation of DOX (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

AMNCs-CL-DOX	–12.4	48	0.3	
The pH-dependent drug release profile of DOX-loaded
AMNCs systems
was investigated under different reservoir-sink conditions (reservoir:
pH 5/pH 7.4 and sink: pH 7.4) at a temperature of 37 °C (Figure 3b,c). The physiological
pH of the blood stream is 7.4, whereas sub-cellular lysosomal compartments
of tumor cells have pH less than 5.0. The drug release studies (Figure 3b) show a strong
dependence of the release profile on the reservoir pH values. Under
these conditions, drug molecules release slowly over a period of 70
h with initial rapid release, followed by a slow, steady, and controlled
release of the drug. The percentages of drug release from different
drug-loaded systems are shown in Table 2. Similar to our results, Aydin et al. reported much
slower release of DOX from the cryogel system prepared through a relatively
stable covalent bonding.35 This is mainly
due to the formation of stable linkage between drugs and nanocarriers.
Between the two systems, the release rate of DOX from AMNCs-HL-DOX
is slightly higher compared to AMNCs-CL-DOX because of the higher
stability of carbamate linkage.36 Further,
it is noteworthy to mention that the release rate of DOX is higher
at low pH for both the cases as carbamate and hydrazone linkages are
prone to faster hydrolysis in acidic condition. Thus, the release
of DOX from the nanocarriers would increase in the acidic environment
of the endosomal intracellular compartments after their internalization.
The observed drug release characteristic is desirable for cancer therapy
as DOX will be released at the targeted site. For instance, Prabaharan
et al. reported that a covalently conjugated DOX-amphiphilic multiarm-block
copolymer reduces the chance of premature drug release outside of
the tumor tissue and shows excellent in vivo stability for targeting
the drugs at cancer cells.37 A significant
difference in these covalently linked systems is that the percentage
of drug release is much lower than that observed from noncovalently
linked systems.8,11 Further, the potential of the
developed nanocarrier for delivery of DOX was evident from our short-term
drug release study (Figure S4, Supporting Information) in serum mediums (Table 2). It showed pH-dependent release of DOX similar to that observed
in buffer mediums (higher in acidic pH). The long-term (>10 h)
release
study could not be performed as fungal growth/protein aggregation
was observed in release mediums beyond 10 h because of the presence
of 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in the release medium incubated at 37
°C.

2.3 Cytotoxicity and Cell Uptake Studies
The cytotoxicity
of DOX-loaded AMNCs were investigated in cancer
cells (WEHI-164, MCF-7, A549) as well as in normal cells (WI26VA4)
(Figure 4). Our results
showed an increase in cytotoxicity (30–60%) in these cancer
cells when the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
AMNCs-CL-DOX/AMNCs-HL-DOX. However, the increase in cytotoxicity was
not in a perfect dose-dependent manner. This could be attributed to
the slow release of covalently bound DOX molecules from nanocarriers
as cleavage of both carbamate and hydrazone linkages is quite a slow
process. The toxicity observed was in a similar range across the three
cancer cell lines used for both the drug-loaded AMNCs systems. However,
DOX-loaded AMNCs showed relatively lower cytotoxicity as compared
to pure DOX. This could be ascribed to the slower release of DOX from
nanocarriers. It is noteworthy to mention that AMNCs-CL-DOX/AMNCs-HL-DOX
showed significantly lower cytotoxicity (up to 20%) in human normal
lung cells (WI26VA4), suggesting its relatively selective toxicity
to cancer cells than normal cells. Moreover, the toxicity of AMNCs
without conjugation of DOX observed in WI26VA4 was further lower (up
to 20%), suggesting their biocompatibility (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The higher toxicity
of AMNCs-CL-DOX/AMNCs-HL-DOX in normal cells than in AMNCs without
conjugation of DOX may be attributed to the presence of DOX, which
may impose higher inherent toxicity in normal cells.

(c) pure DOX toward cancer cells (WEHI-164, MCF-7, A549) and normal
cells (WI26VA4) after 48 h of incubation at culture conditions. (Data

significant values were obtained using a t-test by
comparing the toxicity of cancer cells with respect to normal cells,
*p < 0.1, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Further, we have investigated the cellular uptake of DOX-loaded
AMNC systems in WEHI-164 cells and compared it with that of pure DOX.
In order to explore subcellular localization of DOX, the nuclei of
the cells were stained with DAPI. The blue fluorescence image shows
emission from DAPI-stained nuclei. As shown in Figure 5, WEHI-164 cells exposed to free DOX (magenta
color arises from merged image of DOX and DAPI) showed nuclear internalization
after 3 h, consistent with the earlier studies.38,39 The accumulation of DOX in the nucleus for free DOX occurred as
intracellular DOX molecules in the cytosol were observed to rapidly
diffuse to the nucleus. In the case of DOX-loaded AMNCs, the red fluorescence
signal coming up from DOX emissions was observed mainly in the cytoplasm.
Thus, these nanocarriers have strong capability for intracellular
delivery of anticancer drugs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, AA-functionalized
Fe3O4 magnetic
nanocarriers (∼10 nm) were developed for slow and sustained
delivery of covalently bound anticancer drug DOX to the tumor cells.
These nanocarriers exhibit high water dispersibility, good magnetic
field responsivity, biocompatibility, higher toxicity to tumor cells
(than normal cells), protein resistance, and pH-dependent charge conversal
features. It has been found that the loading efficiency of drugs as
well as their pH-triggered release is strongly dependent on the nature
of the bonding. The DOX–nanocarrier conjugates were found to
be highly sensitive to acidic pH and reasonably stable at physiological
pH. The higher release of DOX at mild acidic pHs such as those encountered
in cancer cells may be due to the faster hydrolysis of carbamate and
hydrazone linkage. These nanocarriers exhibit good cellular internalization
and result in substantial cytotoxicity of DOX. The free hydroxyl group
present on the surface of nanocarriers can provide accessible surfaces
for conjugation of various biomolecules/biolabeling for a variety
of other biomedical applications. Taken together, our results suggest
the ability of these nanoparticles for pH-sensitive release of DOX
and selective cytotoxicity to tumor cells.

4 Experimental

4.1 Materials
Ferrous chloride tetrahydrate
(FeCl2·4H2O, ≥99%), ferric chloride
hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, ACS reagent, 97%),
DOX (98%), BSA, and NPC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. AA,
ferrous ammonium sulphate, 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate, hydrazine
monohydrate, and dimethylformamide (DMF) were procured from Sisco
Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., India. Triethylamine (TEA, ACS reagent,
99.5%) and dichloromethane (DCM) were bought from S. D. Fine Chem.
Ltd., India. Ammonia solution (25%) was obtained from Thomas Baker
Chemical Pvt. Ltd., India. Dialysis membrane-60 was procured from
Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., India. The acetate buffer (AB, pH
5) and PBS (pH 7.4) were prepared using standard protocols. All chemicals
used were of AR grade unless otherwise specified.

4.2 Synthesis of AA-Functionalized Fe3O4 Magnetic
Particles (AMNCs)
AMNCs were prepared
by the co-precipitation method using a stoichiometric mixture of ferrous
and ferric salts in aqueous medium followed by in situ coating of
AA. Briefly, 0.994 g of FeCl2·4H2O and
2.703 g of FeCl3·6H2O (molar ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ = 1:2) were dissolved in 40 mL of oxygen-free
Milli Q water in a round-bottom flask and the temperature was slowly
increased to 80 °C in under nitrogen atmosphere with constant
stirring. The temperature was maintained at 80 °C for 30 min
and then 15 mL of 25% ammonia solution was added instantaneously to
the reaction mixture, and kept for another 30 min at 70 °C. Then,
5 mL aqueous solution of AA (0.88 g) was added to the above reaction
mixture. The temperature was slowly raised up to 90 °C and reacted
for 60 min with continuous stirring for functionalization of particles
with AA. The obtained black colored precipitates were then thoroughly
rinsed 3–4 times with Milli Q water and separated from the
supernatant using a permanent magnet of field strength ∼2.5
kOe.

4.3 Structural Characterizations and Magnetic
Properties
An XRD study was done on a Rigaku diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.540 nm). The crystallite size
of AMNCs is estimated from the X-ray line broadening using Scherrer
formula  where λ is the X-ray wavelength
used,
β is the angular line width at half-maximum intensity, and θ
is Bragg’s angle. Samples for TEM were prepared by sonicating
particles in a liquid medium for 15 min and spreading a few drops
on carbon-coated copper grids. After drying and keeping under vacuum
for 2 h, the samples were examined under an FEI Tecnai T-20 having
LaB6 filament located at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
(TIFR), India. TEM micrographs were digitally recorded on a CCD camera
and particle size was determined after examining at least 10 micrographs.
The infrared spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–400
cm–1 on an FTIR spectrometer (Bomen Hartmann and
Braun, MB series). TGA of the samples was carried out in the range
of 40–500 °C at a scan rate of 10 °C/min under N2 atmosphere. DLS measurement was performed using a Malvern
4800 Autosizer employing a 7132 digital correlator for the determination
of hydrodynamic diameter. The zeta potential measurements were determined
by Zetasizer nanoseries, Malvern Instruments. The colloidal stability
assay was investigated by measuring the absorbance of AMNCs suspensions
(0.1 mg/mL) in different mediums (water and DMEM) at a wavelength
of 350 nm using a JASCO V-650, UV–visible spectrophotometer.
The magnetic measurements of AMNCs were carried out using a vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM, LakeShore, model-7410).

4.4 Drug Loading Studies
The anticancer
drug DOX was used as a model drug to estimate the drug loading and
release behavior of AMNCs. The covalent conjugation of DOX with AMNCs
was carried out through carbamate and hydrazone linkage (Scheme 1) using the modified
protocol reported by Hu et al. for preparation of biodegradable block
copolymer–doxorubicin conjugates.28 The detailed reaction pathway is shown in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information). For brevity, the DOX
conjugated with AMNCs through carbamate linkage and hydrazone linkage
are named as AMNCs-CL-DOX and AMNCs-HL-DOX, respectively.

AMNCs
were first activated with NPC. Briefly, AMNCs (600 mg) were dissolved
in 20 mL of DCM (CH2Cl2). Then, 100 mg of NPC
and 200 μL of TEA were added drop wise to the above solution
at 0 °C (molar ratio of AMNCs/NPC/TEA is 1:1.2:4). The reaction
mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 4 h, and finally, the NPC-activated
AMNCs were obtained through magnetic separation and washed 3–4
times with DCM to remove unreacted regents.

4.4.1 Covalent
Conjugation via Carbamate Linkage
(AMNCs-CL-DOX)
The NPC-activated AMNCs (20 mg) dissolved
in DMF (5 mL) was reacted with DOX (2 mg) in the presence of TEA (10
μL) for 48 h at RT under nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained product
(AMNCs-CL-DOX) was then separated and washed 3–4 times with
DMF through magnetic separation.

4.4.2 Covalent
Conjugation via Hydrazone Linkage
(AMNCs-HL-DOX)
The NPC-activated AMNCs (50 mg) were dissolved
in DCM (3 mL) and hydrazine monohydrate (NH2NH2·H2O) (22 μL) was slowly added into it. The
reaction was carried out for 2 h at RT and hydrazine-modified AMNCs
was separated and washed 3–4 times through magnetic separation.
The hydrazine-modified AMNCs (20 mg) dissolved in DMF (5 mL) were
reacted with DOX (2 mg) in the presence of TEA (50 μL) for 48
h at RT. The DOX-conjugated AMNCs (AMNCs-HL-DOX) were separated using
a magnet and washed for 3–4 times by DMF.

4.4.3 Determination of Loading Efficiency
The fluorescence
spectra of the supernatant (obtained after magnetic
separation of DOX-loaded AMNCs) and pure DOX was recorded using a
Hitachi F 4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (λex: 490 nm), (λem: 594 nm). The fluorescence intensities
of the supernatants (washed drug molecules were also taken into consideration
for calculations) against that of the pure DOX solution (prepared
with appropriate mediums to maintain a similar condition) were used
to determine the loading efficiency. The loading efficiency (w/w %)
was calculated using the following relation  where IDOX is
the fluorescence intensity of the pure DOX solution, IS the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant, and IW the fluorescence intensity of the washed DOX
(physically adsorbed DOX molecules).

4.5 Drug
Release Studies
The pH-triggered
drug release studies were carried out under reservoir (r)—sink
(s) conditions. Drug-loaded particles were immersed into 5 mL of respective
release mediums (AB—pH 5 or PBS 7.4) and then put into a dialysis
bag. The dialysis was performed against 200 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) under
continuous stirring at 37 °C to mimic the cellular environment.
From the external medium, 1 mL was withdrawn at a fixed interval of
time and replaced with fresh PBS to maintain the sink conditions.
The amount of DOX released was determined by measuring the fluorescence
intensity at 594 nm (λex: 490 nm) using a microplate
reader (Gen1.0.5, SYNERGY/H1 microplate reader; BioTeK, Germany) against
the standard plot prepared under similar conditions. Each experiment
was performed in triplicate and standard deviation was given in the
plots. Further, drug release experiments were also performed in serum
conditions (prepared by adding 10% FCS to the respective buffer medium)
under similar conditions as mentioned above.

4.6 Cytotoxicity
and Cell Uptake Studies
An MTT assay was used to investigate
the cytotoxicity of AMNCs, DOX-loaded
AMNCs (AMNCs-CL-DOX, AMNCs-HL-DOX), and pure DOX against three different
cancer cell lines, WEHI-164 (mouse fibrosarcoma cells), MCF-7 (human
breast cancer cells), and A549 (human lung cancer cells), and one
normal cell line, WI26VA (human normal lung cells). The cancer and
normal cell lines were obtained from the National Centre for Cell
Sciences, Pune, India, and Sigma-Aldrich, USA, respectively. The cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics (100
U mL–1 penicillin and 100 μg mL–1 streptomycin) cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells (5000) were seeded in 96-well plates containing
100 μL of culture medium overnight in culture conditions. For
determining the cytotoxicity, the cells were treated with different
concentrations of drug-loaded AMNCs/controls followed by incubation
at culture conditions for 48 h. After this, the culture medium of
each well was replaced by a fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT
and further incubated for 3 h at culture conditions. Following this,
the MTT solution was aspirated, and formazan crystals were solubilized
by adding 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to each well.
For determining the cytotoxicity, the absorbance was measured in a
microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO, Switzerland) at 544 nm.
The cell toxicity was obtained by comparing the absorption of the
treated cells to that of the control, which was defined as 100%. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and the standard deviation
was given in the plot.

Cellular uptake of drug-loaded AMNCs
was investigated using WEHI-164 cells by fluorescence microscopy.
For fluorescence imaging, cells (0.5 × 106) were seeded
on glass coverslips and cultured overnight. The cells were then treated
with AMNCs-CL-DOX/AMNCs-HL-DOX (at a DOX concentration of 4 μM)
and incubated for 3 h under culture conditions, followed by washing
with PBS. The untreated control cells and the cells treated with drug-loaded
AMNCs were mounted on a glass slide in a cell mounting medium (Invitrogen,
USA) containing DAPI for nuclear staining and then imaged by fluorescence
microscopy (Nikon Eclipse Ti, Japan) using a red filter for DOX and
a blue filter for DAPI.
