Chirality transfer from circular
dichroism (CD)-silent secondary
alcohol (inductor) to the stereodynamic bichromophoric di(1-naphthyl)methane
probe (reporter) led to the generation of intense, induced exciton-type
Cotton effects (CEs) in the ultraviolet–visible absorption
region. The di(1-naphthyl)methane probe exhibits extraordinarily high
sensitivity to even small structural variations of the alcohol skeleton,
that is, the probe is able to distinguish between an oxygen atom and
a methylene group in a 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurane skeleton. Signs and
amplitudes of the exciton couplets of 1Bb electronic
transition might be correlated with the type of stereo-differentiating
parts of the molecule flanking the stereogenic center, however, not
with the absolute configuration. The origin of the induced CEs was
established by means of experimental and theoretical methods. As a
result, a mechanism of chirality transfer from the permanent stereogenic
center to the bichromophore is proposed.

Introduction
Chirality, its generation,
sensing, transfer, and amplification
are of paramount significance for numerous processes occurring in
natural and artificial systems.1−4 Chirality transfer can be considered as transmission
of information about the three-dimensional structure of a given substrate
(inductor) or catalyst to the structure of the product(s), further
appearing as an uneven population of diastereomers or enantiomers.5−7 Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) has been widely used to determine
the stereochemistry [i.e., absolute configuration (AC)] of chiral
molecules.8 Together with X-ray crystallography,
ECD allows a full description of the stereochemistry of a chiral molecule
or molecular system in all states of matter.9 Despite some discrepancies,10 the exciton
chirality method is of particular value as it allows direct insight
into the stereochemistry of the molecule if (at least) two chromophores,
with the allowed π–π* electronic transitions, are
present.11−13 The geometrical relationship between the interacting
electronic dipole transition moments (EDTMs), μi and
μj (so-called coupled oscillators), can be easily
related to the stereostructure of a given molecular system. In the
simplest terms, the sign of the exciton couplet is the function of
the dihedral angle ω between interacting EDTMs. In general,
if the two interacting chromophores constitute a clockwise screw sense,
the ECD shows a positive first exciton Cotton effect (CE) at a longer
wavelength and a negative second CE at a shorter wavelength and vice
versa.12−14

Among the natural and artificial chiral molecules,
secondary alcohols
remain one of the most abundant species. Usually, these compounds
are characterized by the lack of suitable chromophore(s), which makes
the stereochemical analysis with the use of ECD spectroscopy impossible.
On the other hand, derivatization of the CD-silent chiral molecule
(inductor) by the stereodynamic bichromophoric probe (reporter) led
to the generation of intense, induced CEs through a mechanism of chirality
transfer from a permanent chirality element.15−19 Since the pioneering work of Nakanishi and Berova,
a variety of achiral or dynamically racemic stereodynamic probes,
introduced by Anslyn, Wolf, Taniolo, Canary, Borovkov, Bornhan, Gawroński,
and others, have been utilized in chirality sensing of molecules usually
having two or more functional groups.20−63 Regardless of the chemical composition and the method of binding
to the inductor, the probe’s mode of action can be defined
as a dynamic adaptation of the chromophoric system to the chiral environment.
However, a characteristic feature of the inductor molecules, tested
so far, is the large sterical difference between substituents around
the stereogenic center(s).

Literature review leads to the conclusion
that the bichromophoric
derivatives of monoalcohols still constitute a not fully explored
class of compounds. This justifies the efforts to develop new or test
existing stereodynamic chromophoric systems as effective chirality
sensors.57,64

Recently, it has been shown that disturbing
the local symmetry
of triphenylmethane led to a generation of characteristic CD signals
observed for a series of nonracemic O-trityl alcohols, N-trityl amines, triphenylacetic acid derivatives, and related
compounds.65−70 The structurally simpler diphenylmethane (benzhydryl) probe has
been used for the determination of chirality of alcohols and hydroxyacids.71−73 Because of the appearance of the observed induced CEs in the short-wavelength
region of the phenyl 1B transitions, the applicability
of the benzhydryl probe is limited.

A high-intensity electronic
transition (1Bb) located at ca. 220 nm and its
well-defined polarization along the
long axis of the chromophore make naphthalene a particularly suitable
chromophore for CD spectroscopy. Recently, we and others have proven
the utility of 1-naphthalene derivatives in stereochemical studies
with the use of chiroptical methods.74−76 For instance, Borhan
used di(1-naphthyl)methanol esters for the determination of absolute
stereochemistry of carboxylic acids. Although the results were spectacular,
the studied objects were characterized by a low structural diversity.77

Feeling that the problem of chirality
sensing by stereodynamic
reporters is not fully explored yet, we decided to show the usability,
or its lack, of diarylmethane-based probes in stereochemical studies
with the use of ECD spectroscopy. We anticipated that proper functionalization
of the phenyl rings in benzhydryl or replacement phenyls by the naphthalene
moieties would provide appropriate chromophoric systems capable of
chirality sensing. In principle, the probes should be structurally
as simple as possible but sensitive to small changes in the inductor
structure. The mechanism of chirality transfer should be possible
to be determined by means of experimental and theoretical methods.
Solubility in the nonpolar environment, preferentially in hydrocarbons,
which facilitates experimental/theoretical analysis, is an additional
desired factor.

Results and Discussion
As it has
been mentioned above, we have intended to show how the
probes under study are sensitive to even small changes in the inductor
structure. Because of the very small difference between methyl and
ethyl substituents flanking the stereogenic center, we have selected
(R)-2-butanol (1a, Chart 1) as the model compound for
preliminary study. Alcohol 1a has been functionalized
by methoxy-substituted benzhydryl probes as well as by di(1- and 2-naphthyl)methyl
groups providing respective diarylmethyl ethers 1b–1f (see Experimental section for details).
Despite many attempts, we were not able to obtain benzhydryl-based
probe substituted by methoxy groups in meta positions.

The most convenient way to indicate sensitivity
in chirogenesis,
and therefore the advantage of a given chromophoric system over others,
is to compare their dissymmetry factors, defined as the Δε/ε
ratio at a given wavelength. However, the definition of the Δε/ε
relationship is straightforward in situations where both the ultraviolet
(UV) and CD curves reach the extreme at the same wavelength. In the
case of exciton couplets, the UV maximum appeared at the wavelength
at which the CD curve with the abscissa is intersected. Therefore,
to avoid discussion on which of the exciton CEs should be applied
to calculate the dissymmetry factors, for the purpose of this work,
we introduced the sensitivity factor G, which used
absolute values of the amplitude of exciton couplets (|A|) and is defined here as G = |A|/ε. The amplitude (A) of exciton CEs is defined
as the difference between the first, long-wavelength CE (Δεlong) and the second, short-wavelength (Δεshort) CE (A = Δεlong – Δεshort).

It is clearly seen
that all of the preliminarily tested probes
are capable of chirality sensing. A more detailed look at the results
led to the following conclusions. Bearing in mind the low structural
diversity of the inductor, the induced CEs measured for the basic
benzhydryl chromophore (1b) are relatively high. The
amplitude of exciton CEs is negative and amounts to −9.1.

Methoxy groups have a diverse impact on the observed induced CD.
The OMe groups at C2 positions enhanced the intensity of the CEs,
as it is seen in 1c. On the other hand, the methoxy groups
at C4 positions of the chromophore make the CD spectrum more complex
and hence more difficult to interpret. Whereas the amplitude of exciton
CEs (ECEs) estimated for 1c (A = −13.8)
is higher than that of 1b, the change in the electronic
structure of 1d caused a significant decrease in the
amplitude (A = −4.6). In addition to the intensity
of the relevant CEs, the position of the absorption bands needs to
be taken into account. Because no significant UV absorption band shift
is observed for either 1c or 1d, compared
to 1b, the usability of methoxy-substituted probes is
not much greater than the basic benzhydryl one.

The presence
of naphthyl groups in 1e and 1f caused a
significant red shift of the respective UV absorption maxima
with simultaneous enhancement of the CEs observed at around 230 and
220 nm. The amplitudes of ECEs estimated for 1e and 1f are almost the same and amount to −38.8 and −40.2,
respectively.

A direct comparison of the G factors
provides
valuable information on the induced optical activity in the given
chromophore (see Table 1). In the homologous series 1b–1f, the estimated G factors diminish in the order 1f ≥ 1e > 1c > 1b ≫ 1d. Although both naphthyl-based
probes gave
a similar CD output, our experience shows that the interpretation
of results obtained for 1-naphthalene derivatives is easier. This
is related to, for example, the less conformational freedom of such
compounds.74−76 Therefore, we have limited further studies to the
di(1-naphthyl)methane derivatives (vide infra).

To investigate the analytical scope of the di(1-naphthyl)methane
probe, we obtained a set of ethers 2b–10b (Chart 1). Because
of the formation of bis(di(1-naphthyl)methane) ether as a byproduct,
the yields of ethers 2b–10b ranged
from good to moderate. It is worth noting that under the same reaction
conditions, the use of di(2-naphthyl)methanol as a substrate led to
products with very low yields, thus confirming the legitimacy of choosing
the di(1-naphthyl)methane probe as a privileged chromophoric system.

The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra measured
at room temperature for ethers 2b–10b did not show any broadened peaks, which could indicate a hindered
rotation within the di(naphthyl)methyl moiety.

The UV spectra
of ethers 2b–10b exhibit intense
absorption bands at around 230 nm because of π–π*
electronic transition polarized along the long axis of naphthalene.
Interactions between the EDTMs in chromophores within the di(1-naphthyl)methane
moiety generate induced nonzero exciton CEs visible in the ECD spectra
of 2b–10b (see Figure 1 and Table 1).

Figure 1 Exemplary ECD spectra of 1e, 4b, and 7b, experimental, measured in cyclohexane solution
(solid
black lines) and calculated on the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level
and ΔΔG-based Boltzmann-averaged (dashed
red lines). Wavelengths were corrected to match the experimental UV
maxima. Δε values are in dm3·mol–1·cm–1. Rotatory strengths (in 10–40 erg esu cm Gauss–1) were calculated as dipole-velocity
representation (Rvel).

Generally, the magnitudes of induced CEs depend
on the structure
of the inductor. For example, a simple elongation of the carbon chain
in 2b causes more than 2-fold increase in the intensity
of the absolute values of CEs compared to 1e. Because
of the sterical congestion around the stereogenic center at the C1
carbon atom, the highest amplitude of the exciton couplet (A = −344.7) was found for menthol derivative 4b. The presence of other aromatic groups in inductor skeletons
revealed in the generation of additional CEs originated from aryl–naphthyl
interactions in the higher energy part of the spectrum.

By far,
compounds 3b, 5b, and 6b constitute
the most challenging tasks for the di(1-naphthyl)methane
probe. Because it is in the parent compounds, citronellol, 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurane
and cholesterol, there are no chromophores absorbing in the spectral
region between 230 and 200 nm, and the observed CEs are apparently
due to the induced helicity of the naphthyl groups in di(1-naphthyl)methane
moieties. In the first case (3b), the stereodifferentiating
methyl group is 3 carbon atoms away from the stereogenic center. Although
the exciton CEs are of the lowest intensity within the whole series,
they are still easily detectable. The estimated amplitude is A = 4.7, which corresponds to the sensitivity factor that
equals 3.2 × 10–5.

For 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurane
derivative 5b, the probe
must distinguish the oxygen atom from the methylene group. However,
the estimated amplitude (A = −24.9) is much
higher than it was expected. This suggested that in the case of 5b, a rough and simple analysis of the inductor structure
based only on the sterical factors might not be sufficient to explain
the origin of the observed induced CEs.

The sensitivity of the
di(1-naphthyl)methane probe to γ-substitution
in the cyclohexane skeleton is also worth mentioning. Even for the
equatorial position of C*(3)–O bond in 6b, the
stereodifferentation between C1 and C10 groups is visible.

Di(1-naphthyl)methyl
ethers under study are very well-soluble in
cyclohexane and, to a limited extent, in polar solvents. However,
to show the scope and limitation of this derivative as a probe, we
measured the ECD spectra of 1e and 2b–10b in acetonitrile that is highly polar but transparent in
the spectral region of interest. In the case of 1e, 3b, and 9b, we observed a small increase in the
amplitudes of respective CEs, whereas for the remaining cases, the
use of polar solvent reduces the amplitudes of respective CEs and/or
reverses their signs. Because the steric requirements of the substituents
remain the same irrespective of the solvent polarity, the reasons
for changing the course of the CD curves can be twofold. First, the
conformer population may change, and second, in cases where the conformation
is determined by other than steric interactions (i.e., electrostatic),
they might lose their importance in the polar environment. ECD spectra
measured for selected cases, namely 6b, 7b, 8b, and 10b in ethanol, have a similar
course to those measured in acetonitrile. The effect of the solvent
on the chiroptical properties of various molecular and supramolecular
systems has been reported previously.78−84

As the observed CEs have exciton character and EDTMs are polarized
along the long axis of the chromophore, their signs are directly linked
to the conformation (helicity) of the chromophore but not to the AC
of the stereogenic center in a given compound. Strictly speaking,
the origin of optical activity of all compounds under study relies
on the generation of an unequal population of conformational diasteroisomers
characterized by either P or M helicity
of a chromophoric system. In the first, but very inexact approximation,
the difference of the steric bulk of the groups flanking the stereogenic
center might constitute the main reason for the induction of dynamic
chirality in a chromophore. Therefore, neglecting the nuances of the
inductor structure, helicity of dominant conformer(s) could be linked
to the relative size of the substituents, as it has been shown in Figure 2. This, in principle,
should allow correlation between the CD data and structure of the
given compound with the use of simplified (semi)empirical approach
(see below and the Supporting Information for details).

dominant helicity of the probe, and the sign of the exciton CE.

In Table 2, the
data comparing the relative size of the substituent, dominant helicity
of the chromophoric system, and AC of C*–O stereogenic center

The analysis of the data from Table 2 leads to some unobvious conclusions. The larger steric
power of the methyl group than that of the phenyl for induction of
dynamic chirality has been reported previously.68 As expected, the highest steric power for helicity induction
within the whole series can be attributed to the −CH(i-Pr)– group, however, the dominant role of −C(15)H2C(16)H2– alkyl chain for helicity induction
in testosterone derivative 7b can be surprising. The
dominant role of the sp3-hybridized carbon atom over that
of sp2 hybridization is seen for malic acid derivative 8b. Therefore, a purely empirical analysis that is based on
sterical factors only, while neglecting other interactions, might
not be enough in some demanding cases.

To shed light on the
origin of optical activity of the di(naphthyl)methane
probe and on the mechanism of chirality transmission from the chiral
inductor to the reporter, we performed experimental and theoretical
studies on the structure-chiroptical property relationships in ethers 1e and 3b–10b as well as
for the model compound 11 (Chart 1). Without wishing to obfuscate the discussion,
all calculation details have been skipped to the Supporting Information. Note that as we compare the experimental
results obtained in nonpolar cyclohexane (dielectric constant equals
2), the solvent model was not implemented in the calculations (see
the Supporting Information for details).

The structures of individual conformers of all di(1-naphthyl)methane
derivatives can be defined by a set of torsion angles α1, α2 (C2Ar–C1Ar–C–O), β1, β2 (H–C–O–C*
and C–O–C*–H), and angle γ that defines
the conformation of the carbon skeleton of an alcohol moiety. Additionally,
we use the angle ω, which corresponds directly to the angle
between interacting EDTMs, μ1 and μ2, polarized along the long axis of the naphthalene chromophore (see Chart 1).

Contrary
to the benzhydryl or trityl, the di(1-naphthyl)methyl
chromophore has not been a subject of detailed studies.73 For this reason, we started the study from establishing
the detailed relationship between the structure of the model compound 11 and the sign and magnitude of the rotatory strengths of
the 1Bb transition.

The potential energy
surface for the change of angles α1 and α2 in 11 is shown in Figure 3a. The low-energy
conformers are lying in the region characterized by the values of
α1 angles ranging from −110° to 0°.
The second naphthyl group adjusts its conformation to the conformation
of the first one. In general, the low-energy conformers are characterized
by the almost perpendicular orientation of aromatic rings (α2 angle is within the range from −30° to 30°).

energy of 11 as a function of angles
α1 and α2. Computed on the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)
level, (b) amplitude (A = Rlong – Rshort) of rotatory
strengths corresponding to experimental exciton couplets of the 1Bb electronic transition as a function of angles
α1 and α2.

The three-dimensional surface, connecting the predicted chiroptical
properties, namely the amplitude of the exciton couplet, is shown
in Figure 3b. The long-wavelength
rotatory strengths and the amplitude of the exciton couplet have the
same two-dimensional behavior, whereas the short-wavelength component
is the opposite (see the Supporting Information). It is clearly seen that the long- and short-wavelength rotatory
strengths remain in an approximate relation as an object to its mirror
image, that is, the minimum at the first surface corresponds to the
maximum on the other. This is apparently due to the exciton-type mechanism
of optical activity generation.

The sign of the given rotational
strength value is not directly
associated with the respective α1 and α2 values, although it corresponds directly to the ω angle.
As expected, for positive values of the ω angle, the positive
values of long-wavelength rotatory strengths (and hence positive exciton
couplets) were calculated and vice versa.

Noticeably, the low-energy
conformers are characterized by high
values of the calculated rotatory strengths. For example, amplitudes
of rotatory strengths calculated for the lowest-energy conformers’
assume values ±1200 × 10–40 erg esu cm
Gauss–1 (see Figure 3b). A large and rapid change in the calculated values
of rotatory strengths along with the α1 and α2 angles change is also worth mentioning.

At the next
stage, we investigated compounds characterized by the
presence of the permanent stereogenic center to establish the mechanism
of the chirality transmission. Because in-depth elaboration of each
calculated structure may obscure the problem, we have limited the
discussion to the lowest-energy structures of 1e and 3b–10b and their crystal counterparts
(if applicable). As the compound 5b deserves special
attention, it will be discussed separately. The remaining theoretical
results are deposited as the Supporting Information.

The ethers under study are characterized by rather high conformational
dynamics (Table 3 and
see the Supporting Information for details).
Apart from compound 8b, in any of the derivatives studied,
the population of the lowest-energy conformer did not exceed 50%.

A
detailed look at the calculated low-energy structures of ethers
and those present in crystals allowed us to determine the factors
that affect the molecular conformation and therefore responsible for
chirality transmission and optical activity of the chromophore (see Table 3). The β1 and β2 angles describe the spatial orientation
of C–H and C*–O and C–O and C*–H bonds,
which might adopt either ±synclinal (sc) and/or ±synperiplanar (sp) orientation with the exception of 3b, where
the β2 angle adopts antiperiplanar (ap) conformation in each low-energy structure.
The change of γ angle, which describes the spatial relationships
between C*-O and C–C aliphatic bonds, affects the energy of
the molecule only in the cases of acyclic and flexible compounds,
such as 1e and 3b.

In the ΔΔG-based lowest-energy conformers
of 1e, 3b, and 6b–10b (shown in Figure 4), the structure of the di(1-naphthyl)methane fragment is
determined by the electrostatic interaction between a positively charged
aromatic proton connected with a C2 carbon atom from one of the naphthyl
groups and the oxygen atom. The calculated (CAr)H···O
distances range from 2.249 to 2.473 Å, which is consistent with
the sp conformation of one of the α angles.
As in the case of 11, conformation of the second α2 angle is, among others, a function of the α1 angle. Because of the CH···π interactions between
the hydrogen atom attached to the C2 carbon atom in the second naphthyl
group and π clouds of the first naphthalene, the second naphthyl
ring adjusted to the conformation of the first one.

Black dashed lines indicate possible attractive interactions. Green
dashed lines indicate the sterical interactions responsible for the
generation of optical activity in the given compound. Distances are
in angstroms (Å).

Other attractive interactions can be found between the oxygen
atom
and one of the aliphatic hydrogen atoms from the inducer. These interactions
are visible, for instance, in the lowest-energy conformers of 1e, 3b, 4b, and 7b between
one of the hydrogen atoms from the terminal methyl group (1e), the protons from the methylene group (3b), the HC(CH3)2 methine proton (4b), and one of
the protons from the methyl group at C13 of the testosterone skeleton
(7b).

The presence of additional polar groups in
the inducer skeleton
may further stabilize the conformation of the given compound. In the
case of 8b, weak C=O···HCAr interactions can be seen, which become even more important for the
mandelic acid derivative 10b. The calculated distance
between the carbonyl oxygen atom and the hydrogen atom attached to
the C8 carbon atom of naphthalene is 2.237 Å. These interactions
might be treated as the main factor that controls the structure of
the lowest-energy conformer of 10b.

It can be concluded
that the oxygen atom(s) organizes substituents
in a specific order around itself. As a consequence, the weak sterical
interactions between the given substituents from the inductor and
one of the naphthyl groups, not involved in strong (CAr)H···O interactions, shifted the equilibrium into
either P- or M-helical conformers.
In the cases of 1e, 4b, 7b, 8b, and 10b, the dominant conformers are characterized
by M-helicity of chromophoric systems, where the
ω angles adopt values −55°, −57°, −63°,
−75°, and −83°, respectively. For 3b, 6b, and 9b, the values of the ω
angle are positive, 69°, 80°, and 77°, respectively,
which correspond to the positive helicity of the chromophoric systems.
The testosterone derivative is an exception. Because of the β
(equatorial) position of the C*–O bond at C17 and the large
distance, the angular methyl group at C13 has less impact on induced
optical activity than the attractive CH···π interactions
between the axial hydrogen atom at C17 and the Cipso carbon
atom from the naphthalene ring. The steric and/or electrostatic CH···π
interactions between naphthalene and the protons from the C12 and
C16 methylene groups are less important.

The correctness of
the conformational analyses discussed above
has been confirmed by the direct comparison of the experimental ECD
spectra with those calculated for ethers 1e, 3b, 4b, and 6b–10b. The
examples of the ECD spectra measured and calculated for the arbitrarily
chosen ethers 1e, 4b, and 7b are shown in Figure 1 (the remaining results are deposited in the Supporting Information). The agreement between the shapes
of experimental and theoretical data is good to excellent, even for
conformationally flexible molecules, with the exception of 5b.

The calculated and ΔΔG-based
and Boltzmann-averaged
ECD spectrum of 5b did not reproduce well the experimental
one. A more detailed look at the calculated low-energy conformers
and their ECD spectra allows explaining this discrepancy. In the case
of 5b, instead of one dominant conformer, there are two
ΔΔG-based lowest-energy structures (conformer
nos. 2 and 8), which account for 32% of the population of all thermally
allowed conformers (see Figure 5a). The structure of conformer no. 2 is stabilized only by
the (CAr)H···O(C*) and CH···π
interactions. The same interactions characterize the structure of
conformer no. 8 and the ΔE-based lowest-energy
conformer no. 16. However, in both conformers (nos. 8 and 16), the
(CAr)H···O interactions between the aromatic
proton, attached to the C8 carbon atom of the naphthalene skeleton,
and the tetrahydrofurane oxygen atom are observed. These interactions
involved those naphthyl groups whose conformations are not stabilized
by (CAr)H···O(C*) interactions. Consequently,
the role of the O1 oxygen atom for the induction of dynamic chirality
is more significant than the results from the simplified empirical
analysis presented above.

were corrected to match the experimental UV maxima. Values of Δε
are in dm3·mol–1·cm–1. Rotatory strengths (in 10–40 erg esu cm Gauss–1) were calculated as dipole-velocity representation
(Rvel).

The comparison of the experimental and calculated for individual
conformer nos. 2, 8, and 16 and Boltzmann-averaged ECD spectra of 5b unambiguously shows that only for conformer no. 16, the
agreement between the experiment and the theory is very good. ECD
spectra, calculated for conformer nos. 2 and 8 as well as the Boltzmann-averaged
theoretical ECD spectrum, remain in disagreement with the experimental
one. This discrepancy is due to the underestimation of conformer no.
16 (and related structures) population.

Taking conformer no.
16 as the representative, we intend to explain
the source of the unusual pattern of ECD spectrum of 5b. As expected, the CEs forming the exciton couplet originated from
transitions involving π orbitals of the naphthalene fragments
(see Figure 6). The
electronic transitions responsible for the lower energy CE involves
mainly HOMO, HOMO–1, HOMO–3, and LUMO+3 orbitals, whereas
electron transitions from HOMO and HOMO–2 to LUMO+7 are mainly
responsible for the second ECE, which is higher in energy. The presence
of two etheric oxygen atoms in the molecule skeleton caused appearance
of the third CE in the experimental spectrum found at around 215 nm.
This particular transition involves, among others, occupied orbitals
HOMO–4 and HOMO–5 and virtual orbitals LUMO+1, LUMO+3,
and LUMO+7.

16 of 5b.

It is worth noting that in the ECD spectrum of 5b measured
in acetonitrile (see the Supporting Information), the CEs vanished, which confirms the importance of weak CH···O
hydrogen bonds for the stabilization of the structure and therefore
the generation of optical activity.

Interestingly, in the crystal
phase, the conformation of the di(1-naphthyl)methane
fragment, as well as the whole molecular system, depends rather on
the way of crystal packing than on the subtle intramolecular interactions
(see Figure 7). This
is especially evident in the case of a conformationally labile compound 1e. In the crystal of 1e, there are two independent
molecules A and B (shown in Figure 7a). Both of them are characterized
by the same ±sc conformations of β1 and β2 angles, which correspond well with
theoretical data. Furthermore, in both molecules A and B, one α angle is ±anticlinal,
whereas the other one remains ±sc. Additionally,
both molecules A and B are characterized
by the bent conformation of the carbon chain, which corresponds to
the ap conformation of the γ angle. Noticeably,
the structures of 1e found in the crystal and calculated
in the gas phase are mutually incompatible with each other.

(b) 6b; (c) 7b; (d) 9b; and
(e) 10b (two independent molecules). Dashed lines indicate
possible intramolecular interactions. Distances are in angstroms (Å).
Note that because of the disorder observed in the crystal of 1e, the alkyl chain in molecule A adopts two
bent conformations (A and A′).

Two independent molecules A and B have
also been found in the crystal of 10b (see Figure 7e). The characteristic feature
of both molecules is the sp arrangement of the C*–O and C=O
bonds. Referring to the calculated structures, such conformation of
the inductor skeleton is associated with an increase in energy, which
for this particular conformer no. 74 is 1.59 kcal mol–1 above the minimum.

The comparison between the theoretically
calculated and experimentally
determined structures of 6b, 7b, and 8b (Figure 7b–d) is more consistent. Both the values of the respective
angles and the general structure of the molecules remain in good agreement.

In the structures found in the crystal, the molecular conformation
is stabilized by the intramolecular C–H···O
hydrogen bonds and C–H···π interactions
shown in Figure 7a–e
(see Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The bulky substituents prevent the participation of an oxygen
atom in the intermolecular interactions.

Conclusions
In
a natural way, it seemed legitimate to raise a question about
the advantage of di(1-naphthyl)methane probe over benzhydryl and other
similar probes described so far. Among the compounds characterized
by the presence of the sec-butyl inductor group attached
to the bi- or trichromophoric probe, a comparison to benzhydryl-based
probe sensitivity in chirogenesis was reported for an N-(1,8-naphthaloyl)-2-aminobenzoyl derivative (|A|/ε = 1.80 × 10–4).57 Derivatives containing the trityl group, namely (R)-trityl-2-butyl ether and triphenylacetamide of (S)-2-butylamine, are characterized by different sensitivities.
Whereas the sensitivity estimated for the O-trityl
group is quite high (|A|/ε = 2.42 × 10–4) and comparable to 1e, the amide is
less sensitive to small changes in the inductor structure because
of the significantly larger inductor–receptor distance.65,68 The latter structural factor is also the reason for the low sensitivity
of the biphenyl-based probe reported by Kuwahara et al. (|A|/ε = 8.00 × 10–5).85 Although for effective chirality transmission,
the bent molecular structure is not a necessary condition, it significantly
improves the sensitivity of the probe.

On the other hand, the
shortcomings of the di(1-naphthyl)methyl
probe should also be reported here. Similar to other probes, the correlation
between the sign of induced ECEs and the structure is straightforward
for inductors having aliphatic groups flanking the stereogenic center,
which significantly differ in size. Therefore, for compounds of type 1e, 2b, and 4b, the plus or minus
sign of the exciton couplet corresponds directly to S and R ACs of the stereogenic center. Compound 9b is a special case because the Me group is by volume larger
than a phenyl group but less important in the determination of the
AC according to the CIP rules. However, the calculations indicate
that the decisive factors for the dynamic induction of chirality in
compounds studied here can be attributed to weak CH···O
or CH···π interactions. Therefore, the simply
“mechanical” model, which takes into account only the
bulkiness of substituents did not perform well in the cases where
subtle interactions determine the structure. Thus, in such cases (5b, 8b, and 10b), the reverse correlation
is visible, that is, the negative couplet corresponds to the S AC. Moreover, the larger the share of this type of interaction
in the stabilization of the structure, the greater the solvent dependence
of ECD output is visible. In the most demanding case of 5b, the change of the environment to highly polar caused diminishing
of the respective CEs. Some chromophoric systems, especially aromatic,
in the inductor structure might have an influence on the CE’s
pattern in a way that cannot be a priori predicted. Thus, the extensive
theoretical studies are compulsory in such cases, which in turn, make
it difficult to define general “correlating” rules.

To sum up this paragraph, we feel empowered to state that the di(1-naphthyl)methyl
probe is highly sensitive to even small structural differences in
the inductor skeleton. The spectacular sensitivity of the di(1-naphthyl)methane
probe to the remote molecular chirality is illustrated with 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurane
derivative 5b. Although the sterical difference between
an oxygen atom and the methylene group flanking the stereogenic center
is negligible, the transfer of chirality is observed.

Finally,
the awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of this
and other similar probes can significantly help in the design and
synthesis of new systems of this and other types.

General Information
Unless otherwise noted, all reactions
were carried out in air atmosphere. Tetrahydrofuran was dried by distillation
over potassium. Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), solvents,
and other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used
as received without further purification.

1H and 13C{H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Ascend 600 MHz
spectrometer at room temperature. Chemical shifts are reported in
parts per million (ppm). Spectra are referenced using an internal
reference (trimethylsilane or CDCl3 residual solvent peak).
Data is described as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet,
d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, and br = broad),
coupling constants (Hz), and integration. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was carried out using Sigma-Aldrich precoated TLC plates (60
Å medium pore diameter with fluorescent indicator 254 nm). Melting
points were measured on a BUCHI B-545 apparatus. High-resolution mass
spectra (HRMS) were measured on a Bruker Impact HD spectrometer. Optical
rotations were recorded on a Jasco P-2000 polarimeter at 20 °C.
ECD and UV spectra were measured using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter
at room temperature in cyclohexane and acetonitrile solutions and
with the use of a quartz cell of optical length 0.05 cm. The concentration
of the ether solutions ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 × 10–4 mol L–1. Background spectra of the pure solvents
were recorded from 400 to 185 nm with a scan speed of 100 nm min–1. The ECD spectra of ether samples were measured with
8 accumulations.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Inductor–Reporter
Systems 1c, 1d and 9b
To a 10 mL round-bottom flask containing diarylmethanol (1 equiv,
1.23 mmol), chiral alcohol 1a or 9a (1.1
equiv, 1.35 mmol), and Yb(OTf)3 (0.1 equiv, 0.12 mmol),
CH2Cl2 (4 mL) was added. The flask was then
sealed, and resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight.
The white precipitate was filtered out, and the solution was concentrated
in vacuo to afford a yellow oil. The corresponding ethers were purified
by column chromatography and crystallization (9b).
