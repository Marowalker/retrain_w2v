A smart nanofluidic device attracts
attention as it enables to
control the physicochemical properties and transportation phenomena,
by using stimuli-responsive materials. This work reports a bioinspired
modification of a conical ion track-etched polyethylene terephthalate
nanopore surface by coating a layer of poly-l-lysine (PLL),
which is a commonly used coating in biotechnology to achieve a dual-responsive
nanofluidic channel by pH or temperature. The rectification of ionic
transportation can be reversed by assembling PLL because of the change
of surface bonds from the carboxyl to amine group. The PLL-modified
nanopore becomes nonconductive as an “OFF” state at
pH 11.5 and at a temperature of 70 °C in solution. The ionic
transport in nanopores can be switched to the “ON” (conductive)
state, by either decreasing pH or temperature. The transitions between “ON”
and “OFF” states present excellent reversibility, which
make the PLL-modified nanopores a promising smart nanofluidic device
that can be used for drug delivery or biomimic ion/mass transport
in future, besides the good biocompatibility and ease of use of PLL
modification.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
ion track-etched nanopores attracted broad interests because
of their capability of ionic transport selectivity for the charged
analytes, which can mimic the biological ion channel.1 Nanopores, nanochannels, and nanopipettes are three kinds
of common solid-state pore structures.2 Solid-state nanopores are fascinating objects that enable the development
of specific and efficient chemical and biological sensors, as well
as the investigation of the physicochemical principles ruling the
behavior of biological channels.3 The “smart”
surface expanded the functionalities of the nanopores such as responsive nanofluidic diodes, sensing,
and energy application,4−8 meanwhile promoting the development of nanofluidics.9−11 Thanks to the surface charge and conical-shape of the nanopores,
ionic current has a preferential direction of conduction, comparable
to a diode,1,12 which were used to mimic the
significant physiological processes of the biological ion channels.13−16 Thus, in a nanofluidic system, the surface properties are predominant
for their physicochemical properties including rectifications of ionic
current and conductance.17 In this field,
particularly interesting is the development of nanofluidic channels
able to precisely modify their ionic transport by selecting the values
of controllable external variables.18 The
“smart” surface helps to construct a functional ionic
diode by using the stimuli-responsive materials,19,20 where the stimuli originated from the change of pH,4,16,21 temperature,22 light,7,23 molecules,24,25 specific ions,5,26,27 and electric field.16,28

Hereby, we report a bioinspired
method to modify asymmetric polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) nanopores by using poly-l-lysine (PLL),
resulting in a dual-responsive nanofluidic diode for the “ON”
and “OFF” states of the ionic transport. PLL has been
widely used in biological and medical science because the PLL-coated
surface has promotion of cellular adhesion and was used for microcapsule
coatings and drug delivery because of its excellent biocompatibility.29,30 PLL can easily form positively charged films by physical adsorption
and electrostatic assembling on various substrates, including glass,31 metals,32,33 polymers,34 and metallic oxides.35 Lin et al. recently demonstrated the rectification of concentration
polarization in mesopores by partly coating PLL on the inner surface
of nanopores, leading to high conductance ionic diodes and high performance
osmotic power.36 Furthermore, it was reported
that PLL can change its wettability by virtue of a dual responsive
conformational change when increasing the ambient temperatures.37 We found that current rectification of a single
nanopore can be reversed by coating of PLL, which can be controlled
by the pH value of the solution because of the change of surface charge
density. The amino group at the PLL surface enables to tailor the
surface property of nanopores for a broad range of chemical/biomolecules.
Most importantly, we found that the conduction of nanopores can be
turned “OFF” by pH and temperatures (over 70 °C)
with excellent repeatability because of the responsive conformational
change of PLL from hydrophilic α-helix conformation to hydrophobic
β-sheet conformation. Finally, we use the dual-responsive (pH
and thermal) properties for future applications, like drug delivery
or molecule motors, by simply coating a layer of PLL. The biocompatibility
and ease-to-use help expand the advanced applications for nanofluidic
devices. In this work, we developed a simple PLL coating method to
construct a multifunctional nanofluidic diode, we believed that this
method can be widely used in drug delivery, sensing, and smart nanofluidic
transportation systems.

2 Results and Discussion
Many kinds of polymers or polyelectrolytes can be functionalized
on to the inner surface of nanopores by noncovalent bonds.38−42 PLL can be easily assembled on the inner surface of negatively charged
nanopores during the strong electrostatic interaction with hydrophilic
and abundant positively charged PLL. We coated a stabilized layer
of PLL on the inner surface of the nanopores by immersing it in PLL
aqueous solution for 4 h.43,44 The tailor chemistry
and responsive wettability of the amphoteric PLL enables to construct
functional nanofluidic devices. We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis on a coated PET surface to ensure the success of PLL
modification (Figure S3). We found that
no apparent peak is observed in the N 1s region before modification
with PLL, which is consistent with the fact that no N atom appears
in the PET film. In contrast, after modification with PLL, an obvious
peak centered at 397.3 eV is observed, implying the presence of the
N atom in the PLL layer on the inner surface of nanopores.

The
PET conical nanopores used in this work have a dimension of
∼2 μm diameter at the base and a tip diameter of ∼40
nm, characterized by SEM for the base opening using multipore membranes
and conductance in 1 M KCl for the tip opening. The schematic process
of PLL modification is illustrated in Figure 1a, where the blue color represents the coated
PLL layer. The inner surface of nanopores before modification presents
carboxy groups, which are likely to dissociate H+ in aqueous
solution, thus forming a negatively charged surface. Whereas the modification
of PLL changes the inner surface of nanopores to amine groups, which
are protonated in a neutral solution, leading to a positively charged
surface, and thus the inverse of current rectification (Figure 1b,c). As a result, we can adjust
the current rectification in a wide range compared to a bare nanopore,
by the PLL-modified nanopore.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of modification of
PLL on the inner
surface of nanopores. The I–V curves of the nanopores recorded in 0.1 M KCl (pH = 7) before (b)
and after (c) modification with PLL.

Here, we define the rectification ratio (frec) as frec = I(−1V)/I(+1V). To clearly represent the direction
of current rectifications, logarithm r = log (frec) was introduced as a specific factor. When r > 0, the nanopore is cation-selective; however, when r < 0, the nanopore is anion-selective. We found that
the r value changes from 1.72 to 0.84 with pH increases from 3 to
11.5, which we attributed to the polarity inversion of charge density
at the PLL-modified nanopore inner surface. The wide range of current
rectifications in PLL-modified nanopores, tuned by the pH values of
aqueous solution, again demonstrated the predominant contribution
of the surface charge in the nanofluidic system. The pH value of KCl
aqueous solution was carefully adjusted by diluted HCl or KOH solutions.
According to the reported pKa value of
PLL (10.5),30,32 the PLL-modified nanopore has
a positively charged surface at a pH lower than 10.5 while the neutral
surface is at a pH higher than 10.5.

The chemical equilibrium
states of the PLL-coated nanopores under
different pH values are shown in Figure 2a. The I–V curves under different pH are shown in Figure 2c. In the range of 3 < pH
< 10.5, the r value remains negative with an increased
absolute value of the pH value, which was attributed to the gradual
protonation of amine groups on the PLL layer. It is interesting to
be noted that we observed a reversed rectification when pH > 10.5
(r > 0), which we suspect was due to the negative
charges arising from the underlying carboxylate groups on the nanopore
walls. This result is consistent with the phenomenon reported in a
previous work.41 Our results indicate that
the current rectification of a PLL-modified nanopore is responsive
to the pH value of solution, with the most negative r value being
−1.72 at pH = 3 and the most positive r value being 0.84 at
pH = 11.5.

pH of PLL-modified nanopores and nanopores after reacting with SA,
respectively.

Besides the biocompatibility, another benefit of using the PLL-modified
surface is that it is easy to be tailored. Here, we took the SA as
an example which can transform amine groups into carboxyl groups in
the nanopore.12 The scheme in Figure 2a presented the reaction
process that transforms amine groups to carboxyl groups on the PLL
layer. The chemical equilibrium state of the PLL layer after reacting
with SA is also illustrated in Figure 2b. The reaction with SA transforms the exposed amine
groups into carboxyl groups, which are negatively charged when pH
> 3.45 The responsive behaviors of the
PLL nanopores after reacting with SA as a function of pH were measured.
The I–V curves of the PLL
nanopores after reacting with SA presented an inversion of the rectification
direction compared with PLL-modified nanopores (Figure 2b). The r value enhanced
with the increase of pH in the range of 3.4 < pH < 8.6 (Figure 2b), which can be
assigned to the gradual deprotonation of carboxyl groups. These experiments
illustrate the versatility of the PLL layer in combination with the
chemistry of the amine group for tailoring the surface properties
of pore walls.

It was reported that the wettability can be changed
on a PLL-modified
surface because of the conformational change of PLL because of the
high temperature and pH.37 By using this
pH and thermal responsive wettability change, we could possibly achieve
“ON” and “OFF” states of the ionic conduction
by virtue of a dual responsive conformational change.23Figure 3a illustrated that the schematic conformation of PLL was α-helix
at room temperature (20 °C) when pH = 11.5 (higher than pKa of PLL 10.5), which remained as a hydrophilic
wetting state of the nanopore inner surface. However, the conformation
changed to the β-sheet at a temperature of 70 °C possibly
inducing a hydrophobic surface that repels water from the nanopores.

nanopores tuned by the temperature between 20 and 70 °C in 0.1
M KCl (pH = 11.5).

To investigate the thermal
responsive effects on the ionic conductivity
of the PLL-modified nanopores, we gradually increased the temperature
of the electrolyte solution (pH = 11.5) by placing the whole setup
on a heating stage, with the solution temperature characterized by
a thermometer. The I–V curves
of PLL-modified nanopores in 0.1 M KCl solution (pH = 11.5) at various
temperatures were presented in Figure 3b. The I–V curve of PLL-modified nanopores at 20 °C in 0.1 M solution
(pH = 11.5) demonstrated selectivity on cations, which is consistent
with the results at pH = 11 mentioned above (Figure 2c). We found that the conductance of PLL-modified
nanopores at both positive and negative biased voltages was clearly
enhanced with gradual increases with the temperature. However, when
the ambient solution temperature increases to 70 °C, we found
the PLL-coated nanopores become nearly nonconductive, probably caused
by the transition of wettability from hydrophilic to hydrophobic corresponding
to the conformation transforming of the PLL layer from α-helix
to β-sheet. When pH = 11.5, temperature = 20 °C, the conformation
of the PLL layer was α-helix, which was hydrophilic, the KCl
solution can transport through the nanopore. This is the “ON”
state. While when the temperature increased to 70 °C, the conformation
of the PLL layer changed to the β-sheet, which was hydrophobic,
the KCl solution cannot transport through the nanopore. This is the
“OFF” state. Therefore, we could tune the artificial
ionic channel to be the “ON” state by maintaining the
hydrophilic α-helix conformation at low temperatures, and turned
it “OFF” by increasing the temperature to hydrophobic
β-sheet conformation. As a control group, we performed the I–V characterizations of a bare
nanopore in the same conditions (0.1 M KCl solution at pH = 11.5)
under different temperatures (Figure 3c). We found that the conductance continuously increased
even at 70 °C, with the increased value of nanopore conductance
well matched to the increase of bulk conductivity at high-temperature
solutions. The results from the control group experiment demonstrate
the “OFF” state of the artificial ionic channel directly
relevant to the coated PLL layer.

A few phenomena were interesting
to be noted. First, to clearly
discuss the effects of the temperatures, we again derived the rectification
ratio (Figure 3e) and
conductance (Figure 3f) by the slope of I–V curves
at positive and negative biased voltages. Figure 3f indicated the conductance increased with
the temperature from 20 to 50 °C at the “ON” state,
which can be attributed to the increase of bulk conductivity of KCl
solutions regarding the increase of temperatures. The increased frec in PLL-modified nanopores seemed to be higher
than in the bare nanopore, which can be seen in Figure 3e with rectification ratio frec as a function of temperature. Our results showed that
the frec increased from 6.99 to 10.4 corresponding
to the temperature of solution increasing before it transformed to
the “OFF” state (below 70 °C). However, the frec remained almost the same for the bare nanopore
at all temperatures because of the equal enhancements of conductance
at positive and negative biased potentials. We suspect that the surface
charge increased with the gradual conformational change of the PLL
surface. Hence, we suspect that the clear enhancement of rectification
ratio was due to the increase of surface charge at the chemical equilibrium
state of modified PLL caused by conformational change with increase
of temperature.

The transition of PLL conformation was reported
at the solution
of high pH values and high temperatures, which make it possible to
be switched between “ON” and “OFF” states
of an artificial ionic channel by changing both pH value and temperature.
To prove this concept, we performed the experiment with control experiments
of PLL-modified nanopores in pH = 7 solution at a temperature of 70
°C. We characterized the I–V curves of PLL-modified nanopores in 0.1 M KCl solution (pH = 7)
at different temperatures (Figure 3d), and found that the conductance continuously increased
with the temperature from 20 to 70 °C. This result indicated
that the switch of the “ON/OFF” state could be regulated
by both pH and temperature.

In addition, hereby we performed
heating and cooling cycles on
the solution (Figure 3g) and measured the I–V curves
of PLL-modified nanopores, maintaining the pH value at 11.5. Our results
in Figure 3g demonstrated
the ionic conduction can be turned to be conductive (ON state) and
nonconductive (OFF state) with an excellent reversibility switched
by changing the temperature between 20 and 70 °C in 0.1 M KCl
(pH = 11.5). Besides, the rectified currents existed at 20 °C
when it was a “ON” state and disappeared at 70 °C
when it was an “OFF” state. Our results indicate that
the versatile functions of PLL-modified nanopores, which act as a
dual responsive ion gate that can be reversibly switched by the temperature
and pH of the solution. Finally, we believe that the PLL-modified
nanopores can be useful in smart control of ion/mass flow in drug
delivery, chemical/biosensing, and transportation-related phenomena.

3 Conclusions
We report a bioinspired strategy to achieve
a dual-responsive functional
nanofluidic device by employing a layer of PLL on a conical single
nanopore surface. With the PLL successfully self-assembled on the
inner surface of nanopores because of physical/electrostatic adsorptions,
we demonstrate that the PLL-modified nanopores has an inversed rectification
compared to the initial state because of the change of the surface
charge polarity, resulting in a pH-dependent nanofluidic diode. Furthermore,
the PLL layer can be further modified by SA that transform the amino
groups into carboxyl groups at the inner surface, leading to the inverse
of surface charge. The modification of the PLL layer enables further
condensation reaction based on amino and carboxy groups. Furthermore,
we demonstrated a dual-responsive ionic transport by using the transition
of wettability at PLL-modified surface by either pH or temperature.
Our results showed that the ionic conduction of a single nanopore
can be switched “OFF” (nonconductive) at pH 11.5 and
in 70 °C solutions; however, it can be switched “ON”
(conductive) by either lowering the temperature or pH value. We attribute
this transition of nanopore conduction to the conformation change
between hydrophilic (α-helix) and hydrophobic (β-sheet)
of the PLL layer, in which the former state repels water and ions
transported through the nanopores. We found that this transition between
“ON” and “OFF” states is reversible and
can be well repeated for many cycles. Finally, we achieved a pH and
temperature responsive ionic conduction in a single conical nanopore,
enabling well-controlled ion/mass transportation within the nanopores.
We believed that the PLL coatings can be widely useful in the drug
delivery, sensing, and smart nanofluidic transportation systems.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fabrication and Modification
of a Single Nanopore
The 13 μm PET foil was irradiated
by a single swift heavy
ion 86Kr26+ of 2.1 GeV at the Lanzhou Interdisciplinary
Heavy Ion Microbeam to form a single latent track and then the foil
was irradiated under ultraviolet (365 nm, 4.2 mW/cm2) for
1 h on both sides. The foil was subjected to a standard asymmetric
wet chemical etching process which was described previously.46,47 The foil with a single conical nanopore was immersed in a 25 μg/mL
PLL solution (Mw = 150 000–300 000,
Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h, then was rinsed with ultrapure water, and
dried in an oven at 45 °C for 4 h before measurements.43

4.2 Current Measurements
The single conical
nanopore PET foil was mounted on a custom-designed system for current
measurements, where the foil isolated the two chambers containing
0.1 M KCl solution. Current–voltage characteristics were recorded
with a picoammeter (Keithley 6487) with a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes.
The voltage was changed between −1 and +1 V with 0.1 V steps.
During the temperature responsive experiments, the whole measurement
system was placed in a water bath to keep the ambient temperatures
constant, and to obtain I–V curves at the meantime.
