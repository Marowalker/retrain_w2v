Three
new squaraine-based functional π-conjugated molecules
were synthesized considering the core and wings concept. The molecules, SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH, were end-capped with three different wings, such as malononitrile,
2-(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile, and 3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one.
Among the three dyes, SQ-DICN-RH showed the highest molar
extinction coefficient. The photoluminescence of all the dyes showed
an opposite trend to that of the absorption maximum. The electrochemical
results showed that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level
of all the dyes ranged from −3.72 to −3.82 eV, whereas
the highest occupied molecular orbital ranged from −4.89 to
−4.94 eV. Solvatochromism was carried out to observe the effects
of the solvent containing the dyes. The electronic structure of the
dyes was examined using ab initio simulations. The
dyes were characterized theoretically, and the red-shifted absorption
of SQ-DICN-RH was explained and correlated with its biradicaloid
character and singlet–triplet energy gap.

Introduction
The
absorption of photons in the near-infrared (NIR) region by
fluorescent dyes has an increasing number of applications in biomedical
science,1 materials science, and nanotechnology.2 A series of NIR dyes, such as BODIPY, DPP, phthalocyanine,
and squaraine, have been reported.3 Among
them, squaraine dyes have shown promising applications in fluorescent
probes,4,5 photosensitizers [in dye-sensitized solar
cells (DSSCs)],6 electron donors [in organic
photovoltaic (OPV)],7 optical storage media,8−10 sensitizers for photodynamic cancer therapy,11−13 and two-photon
absorbing materials.14,15 Because OPV devices are being
fabricated with a blend of fullerene and polymer/small molecule (SM)
derivatives, which play a key role in enhancing the power conversion
efficiency (PCE).16 Fullerene derivatives
such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester and phenyl-C71-butyric
acid methyl ester have been widely accepted as electron-accepting
materials, whereas polymers are used as donor materials. Fullerenes
have high dominance in OPV because of their advantageous properties
such as (i) electron-withdrawing capability, (ii) high electron mobility,
and (iii) three-dimensional transportability of electrons due to their
shape.17

Notwithstanding advantages,
fullerene has some limitations, that
is, it does not cover the entire visible region of the incident solar
spectrum because of weak absorption, cost-effective synthesis, and
effects in the aggregation and morphology of thin films. In the past
few years, a considerable concentration has been waged on the development
of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs)18,19 in OPVs instead
of fullerene derivatives. Novel NFAs show number of superior properties
over the fullerene, such as ease of synthesis, high absorption in
the visible to NIR region of the solar spectrum, and structural plasticity,
which allows tuning the energy levels of donors and acceptors. By
considering all these superior properties, NFAs have been designed
and applied in OPVs. In this regard, Beaujuge et al. reported (compound 1, 2, and 3 shown in Figure 1) small molecular acceptors
having malononitrile as the end group with a PCE of 5.3%.20 Lim et al. introduced fluorene/carbazole-containing
rhodanine-based acceptors (compound 4 and 5 shown in Figure 1) for OPV and resulted in a PCE of 3.08%.21 Recently, Zhan et al. reported indacenodithiophene as a core and
ethyl rhodamine/malononitrile as an end group22,23(6a, 6b) and achieved a PCE of 5.12 and
4.81%, respectively. Malononitrile end group-based organic molecules
have also been used in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and
have achieved the mobility24,25 up to 0.64 cm2 V–1 s–1.

NIR squaraine dyes, showing absorption beyond 700 nm, helped
in
constructing transparent and semitransparent photovoltaic devices.26,27 The squaraine dyes were classified into two categories: symmetrical
and unsymmetrical. The symmetrical squaraine molecules followed a
simple synthetic pathway and could be synthesized via the condensation of electron-rich molecules (such as indolium salts)
with squaric acid. The electronic and optical properties of such dyes
depend on their energy gap, that is, the energy difference between
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO). The absorption and emission properties of
fluorescent dyes that undergo wide changes in charge dispersal and
photoexcitation processes involving intramolecular electron transfer
are quite sensitive to the nature of the solvent used.

Because
squaraine dyes possess reasonable photo- and thermal stability
and exhibit an intense absorption peak, they have been used widely
as an electron-donating material in the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ)
solar cells.28−30 Although considerable attention has been paid toward
the molecular engineering of new squaraine dyes, there have been few
studies on the structural–property relationship of these promising
optoelectronic materials.31 In general,
the molecular architecture of these squaraine dyes is in a donor (D)–acceptor
(A)–donor fashion. Their photophysical and electrochemical
properties can be tuned finely further by altering the basic architecture
through the design of a newer concept, that is, donor−π–acceptor–donor
(D−π–A–D), donor−π–acceptor−π–donor
(D−π–A−π–D), and acceptor−π–donor–acceptor−π–donor
(A−π–D–A−π–D). The
most successful design of photonic materials was reported by the Bazan
research group.32 They introduced a new
class of small molecule donor materials for solution-processed OPVs.
Before this work, SMs appeared to be intrinsically inferior to polymers
in their ability to generate useful BHJ solar cells. They developed
a new framework that can generally be explained as consisting of an
electron-rich central core flanked by a poor electron-withdrawing
unit and finished with π-conjugated end caps. This scaffold
recommended the suitable synthetic entry to a wide class of materials
with tailored electronic, optical, and physical properties.

This paper reports three symmetrical novel SQ dyes with the acceptor−π–donor–acceptor–donor−π–acceptor
(A−π–D–A–D−π–A)
architecture. The three SQ dyes were decorated with three different
acceptors as end groups (wings) [malononitrile, 2-(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile,
and 3-ethyl-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one], respectively, and a central
squaraine unit as the core. This study examined the photochemical
properties in different solvents regarding the solubility and potential
applications. The geometries (cis- and trans-isomers) and biradical character of the dyes were analyzed by density
functional theory (DFT). The calculated electrochemical and photophysical
properties were compared with the experimental data. The reasons behind
the red-shifted absorption for SQ-DICN-RH were investigated
using theoretical simulations.

Results and Discussion
The core
and wings concept is useful for symmetrical systems when
compared with another multichromophoric system for absorption of sunlight
in the visible to NIR regions of the solar spectrum. Using the core
and wings concept, we can attach different kinds of end groups (wings)
to know the electronic properties of respective dyes by keeping the
core as constant. Bazan et al. proposed a core and an end-capping
group concept in SM BHJ solar cells as donors, and they reported the
DTS(PTTh2)2 structure based on a core donor–acceptor
framework with end-capping units with a PCE of 6.7%.32 We recently reported four SMs based on the core and wings
concept and dithienosilole (DTS) used as a core for four molecules
at the center of the molecule as an electron donor (Figure 2).33

structures of SMs based on the core and wings concept.

Squaraine dyes having a multichromophoric system,34 explored in OPVs, DSSCs, and OFET; however,
the core and
end-capped (wing) concept are untouched. In this article, we report
that three electron-acceptor units [malononitrile or 3-ethyl rhodanine
or 2-(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile] are connected
in conjugation with the central squaraine core moiety, which as a
result enhanced the absorption in the solar spectrum and electron
affinities. Complete representation of core and wings is shown in Figure 3.

the core and wings design.

Absorption and Photoluminescence Spectroscopy
The optical
absorption spectra of SQ dyes were collected in dichloromethane (DCM)
and are shown in Figure 4; the related data are summarized in Table 1. SQ-DIEt-RH, SQ-DICN, and SQ-DICN-RH dyes show a prominent absorption maximum
at 710, 716, and 720 nm with vibration progression at 650, 656, and
661 nm, respectively. The absorption at longer wavelengths was attributed
to a charge transfer π–π* transition. The new less-intense
broad absorption band in the region from 365 to 450 nm was assigned
to the prolonged conjugation occurring from the dicyanovinyl unit. SQ-DCN-RH, showing a greater λmax with respect
to the other two SQ dyes, was attributed to the presence of extended
conjugation and the dicyanovinyl unit. The emission spectra of the
three SQ dyes were measured in a DCM solution and are displayed in Figure 4. The fluorescence
spectrum of SQ-DIEt-RH, SQ-DICN, and SQ-DICN-RH dyes showed the emission maximum at 738, 745, and
757 nm with a Stokes shift of 27, 29, and 28 nm, respectively, which
is in contrast to the absorption maxima trend.35 These smaller Stokes shifts arise because of the conformational
rigidity, that is, the presence of an analogous configuration of the
dye molecules in the ground state as well as in the excited states.

Electrochemical Properties
The redox propensity of
the dyes was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential
pulse voltammetry in DCM solution shown in Figure 5. Table 2 lists the relevant data of the dyes. All dyes showed
two quasi-reversible oxidation couples attributed to simultaneous
electron elimination from indolium salts. For the first anodic peak, SQ-DCN showed difficult oxidation because of the strong electron-withdrawing
nature of the dicyanovinyl unit on both sides of the squaraine building
block. The order of the oxidation pattern is as follows: SQ-DIEt-RH = SQ-DCN-RH (0.53) < SQ-DCN (0.57).
On the other hand, the second oxidation was similar for all dyes due
to the same electron richness of the cation dyes. Therefore, the band
gap of SQ-DCN is lower than that of the other dyes. The
HOMO of the dyes was calculated from the oxidation of SQ dyes with
respect to the ferrocene/ferrocenium cation. The HOMO and LUMO of SQ-DCN were high compared to the other dyes and it can act
as a better donor to construct the organic solar cell devices by blending
the PCBM electron acceptor. The remaining rhodanine and dicyanorhodanine
dyes showed similar HOMO and LUMO values.

a Eox* (excited-state oxidation potential)
of the SQ dyes was evaluated by the ground-state potential of the
SQ dye in the Rehm–Weller equation (Eox* = Eox – E0–0). Eox was calculated from CV; it is the ground-state
oxidation potential. The thermodynamic driving force of the electron
injection is as follows: (ΔGinj)
= Eox* – ECB.

Solvatochromism
To examine excited-state
properties
of SQ dyes, the absorption and the emission profile of all the SQ
dyes were scrutinized with different solvents, that is, toluene (TOL),
chloroform (CHL), DCM, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate (EA),
and dimethylformamide (DMF) as shown in Figure 6. Generally, all the absorption profiles
of the SQ dyes are insensitive to the solvent polarity, which indicates
the presence of the less polar ground state. The absorption spectra
of SQ-DICN-RH, SQ-DICN, and SQ-DIEt-RH in different solvents did not show a significant shift in the λmax value, that is, 10, 4, and 13 nm, respectively, in the
ground state. On the other hand, in emission spectra, SQ-DICN-RH showed an increase in wavelength from 738 nm (nonpolar solvent)
to 761 nm (polar solvent); SQ-DICN emission spectra showed
an increase in wavelength from 744 to 768 nm, and similarly, the SQ-DIEt-RH emission spectra ranged from 736 to 760 nm. In SQ-DICN-RH, 740 nm emissions were observed in DCM and were
red-shifted 20 nm in DMF because of the increase in polarity.

Figure 6 Absorption
(a–c) and emission (d–f) spectra of the
SQ dyes in different solvents.

In contrast, the dye SQ-DICN in DCM showed an
emission
maximum at 745 nm, whereas it was 760 nm in DMF. SQ-DIET-RH in EA showed an emission at 730 nm, showing a 30 nm shift compared
to that in DMF. Therefore, the emission spectra showed a reasonable
positive response toward the solvatochromism with increasing solvent
polarity. This suggests that the excited state of all the SQ dyes
is more polar than the ground state because they may have a planar
type structure in the excited state. In general, the difference in
the Stokes shift between the polar and nonpolar solvents is due to
charge transfer from the organic luminogens in the excited state.36

Spectroelectrochemical Properties
The spectroelectrochemistry
study was carried out to better understand the spectroscopic and electrochemical
behavior of the dyes. This study focused mainly on the UV–visible
region because electron transfer in the electrochemical system occurs
in the same region because of the high molar absorption coefficient
of the dyes. CV of all three dyes was performed in DCM and showed
two quasi-reversible oxidation waves in the range from 0.53 to 0.57
and 0.94 to 0.96 V in the anodic region versus calomel electrode.
Upon applying the controlled oxidation potential to all the SQ dyes,
the intense absorption peak in the visible region decreased gradually
with the formation of isosbestic points nearly at 582 and 757 nm,
which indicates the oxidation outcome in a single product. This might
be due to the squaraine cation radical formation. The potential of
0.94–0.96 V was also applied for all the dyes, but no significant
change in the absorption spectra was observed. SQ-DICN-RH shows a fast gradual decrease because of the presence of an electron
acceptor and extended conjugation. When applied oxidation potential
was removed, the absorption spectra returned almost to its original
absorption. Figure 7 presents the UV–visible spectroelectrochemical changes with
the SQ-DICN-RH, SQ-DICN, and SQ-DIEt-RH dyes recorded in DCM at the respective applied potentials.

Theoretical Calculations
To gain
deeper insights into
the structural (geometrical isomerism), electrochemical, and optical
behavior (bathochromic shift for SQ-DICN-RH), a detailed
theoretical investigation was carried out using first-principles ab initio simulations. The cis- and trans-isomers of the synthesized SQ dyes were modeled; Figure 8 shows the optimized
geometries and the deviations in the dihedral angles of their wings.
The corresponding geometries of the cis-isomers are
given in Figure S18 in the Supporting Information. The trans-isomer of the SQ dye is relatively more stable than the corresponding cis-isomer and the relative energies are given in Figure S18. The trans-isomers
of SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH were 0.95, 0.93, and 0.96 kcal/mol more stable, respectively, than
the corresponding cis-isomers. The low stability
of the cis-isomers can be attributed to the steric hindrance caused
by the one-sided alignment of the wings with respect to the squaraine
moiety. The ground-state geometries of the cis-isomers
possess higher dipole moments than the corresponding trans-isomers. Both the cis- and trans-isomers were planar and differed only in the orientation of the
wings attached to the squaraine moiety.

Figure 8 Ground-state optimized
structures of the SQ dyes (trans-isomers) and the
deviations from the planarity of their wings. Hydrogen
atoms were omitted for clarity.

The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of each dye were calculated
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The electron cloud distribution
in the FMOs of the dyes is shown in Figure 9, whereas Figure S19 in the Supporting Information shows the corresponding electron density
distribution of cis-isomers. For both the cis- and trans-isomers, the electron density
was localized mainly over the squaraine core in the HOMO and was dispersed
toward the attached wings in the LUMO. The calculated HOMOs and LUMOs
of the dyes were well matched with those obtained from the CV measurements.
The theoretical HOMO eigenvalues of the dyes were −5.92, −5.82,
and −5.86 eV, respectively, for SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH. The LUMO energies
were calculated by adding the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) transition
energy (ES0→S1) to the corresponding HOMO energy, rather than considering the unreliable
Kohn–Sham LUMO eigenvalue.37 The
LUMO energies for SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH obtained from this method were −4.26, −4.12,
and −4.21 eV, respectively. The calculated LUMO eigenvalues
were in good agreement with those obtained experimentally.

Figure 9 Isodensity
plots (isosurface = 0.02 e Å–3) of the FMOs
of SQ-DICN (top), SQ-DIEt-RH (middle), and SQ-DICN-RH (bottom).

The optical properties of the dyes were evaluated using the
TDDFT
formalism; Figure 10 shows the simulated UV–visible absorption spectra. The simulated
absorption spectra reproduced the main bands observed in the experimental
spectra. The calculated absorption maxima (λmax)
for SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH in the low energy region were 748, 728, and 752 nm, respectively.
These intense transitions were attributed mainly to HOMO →
LUMO excitation. The other two absorption peaks with less intensity
were observed at ca. 550 nm and ca. 450 nm. The red-shifted absorption (NIR absorption) of the squaraine
dyes can be attributed to their biradicaloid character (BRC) rather
than the charge transfer.38,39 The method suggested
by Nakano et al. based on orbital occupation numbers was used to estimate
the BRC percentage of the three dyes.40  where Si is the
orbital overlap.

Figure 10 Simulated UV–visible absorption spectra of the
SQ dyes obtained
at the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory in a CHL solution.

The calculated BRC percentage
of the dyes was 12.9 and 13.3% for SQ-DICN and SQ-DICN-RH, respectively, whereas
the SQ-DIEt-RH dye did not show any BRC. The red-shifted
absorption (λcal = 752 nm) of SQ-DICN-RH can be attributed to the high BRC (13.3%) among the three dyes.
Although the calculated BRC of the dyes was low, the order of the
BRC is in accordance with that of the absorption maxima of the dyes.
As per the earlier reports, the BRC is underestimated by DFT functionals;41,42 hence, we used the UHF/6-31G(d) level of theory to evaluate the
BRC of the dyes. The adiabatic singlet–triplet energy gap (ΔES–T) was taken as the difference in the
energies of the lowest singlet ground state (S0) and the
corresponding lowest triplet state (T1). The S0 geometries were considered to be the initial geometries to optimize
T1 at the UB3LYP/6-31g(d) level of theory. The calculated
ΔES–T of the dyes was 21.51,
21.68, and 21.41 kcal/mol for SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH, respectively. The relatively high
ΔES–T values exhibited by
the dyes are responsible for their lower BRC (Table 3).

Conclusions
Three new squaraine
dyes were synthesized and characterized systematically.
The core and wings concept was adopted to design these dyes, which
is the most successful design for developing high-performing photonic
materials. The absorption and emission spectra of these squaraine
dyes were recorded in DCM (10–5 M). Among these
three dyes, SQ-DICN-RH showed a greater λmax with respect to the other two SQ dyes because of the presence of
extended conjugation and a dicyanovinyl unit. The absorption spectra
of these dyes were not sensitive toward the solvent polarity, which
indicates the less polar ground state but the emission spectra showed
a reasonable positive response toward the solvatochromism with increasing
solvent polarity. This suggests that the excited state of all the
SQ dyes is more polar than the ground state. The results agreed well
with the computational study. This study paves the way to the design
and synthesis of other derivatives for high-performing optoelectronic
materials.

General Methods and Materials
All
precursor materials,
5-formyl-2-thienylboronic acid, malononitrile, 3-ethyl rhodamine,
and squaric acid, were purchased directly from commercial sources
and used as received. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were measured using AVANCE ACP-300, AVANCE-400, and AMX2-500 spectrometers
at 300, 400, and 500 MHz, respectively, using tetramethylsilane (TMS)
as an internal standard. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF)
were performed on a Shimadzu LCMS-2010 EV model with an ESI probe.
CV was performed on CH Instruments with a three-electrode system consisting
of a glassy carbon working electrode, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode,
and a platinum wire counter electrode. A UV–visible spectrophotometer
was used to record the absorption spectra of the SQ dyes in DCM solution.
The redox potentials of the dyes were measured in DCM containing 0.1
M Bu4NClO4 at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1.

Synthesis

in the literature.43,44 The designed intermediate symmetrical
squaraine dye, SQ-2CHO, was synthesized via Suzuki cross-coupling between SQ-2Br and 5-formyl-2-thienylboronic
acid. A condensation reaction between SQ-2CHO and the
end groups, malononitrile, 3-ethyl rhodamine, and 2-(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile,
in CHL with base afforded the target molecules. All compounds were
characterized thoroughly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, 1H and 13C) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, MALDI, and HRMS.

General Synthetic Procedure
for SQ-DICN, SQ-DIEt-RH, and SQ-DICN-RH
In a two-necked
round bottom flask, the corresponding SQ-2CHO and malononitrile
or 3-ethyl rhodanine or 2-(3-hexyl-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidene)malononitrile
were placed in 6 ml of dry CHCl3. To this, one drop of
piperidine was added and the resulting mixture was refluxed. The reaction
mixture was observed by TLC. Upon completion of the reaction, it was
allowed to cool to room temperature followed by work-up with water,
drying over Na2SO4, and concentration under
vacuum. The final product was separated by the column chromatography
technique and DCM/methanol (99:1, v/v) as the eluent to obtain the
pure compounds.

Computational Details
The Gaussian
09 quantum chemical
program was used for DFT and TDDFT calculations of the three SQ dyes.45 The DFT method was used to examine the structural
and electrochemical properties, and the TDDFT method was used for
the excited-state properties. Each of the three SQ dyes was modeled
with two isomers, that is, cis and trans. The geometries were optimized with RB3LYP hybrid exchange–correlation
functional in combination with the 6-31G(d) basis set.46 The method employed in the present study has
been successfully used to deal with the other biradical systems such
as croconate dyes.47,48 The optimized geometries of the
dyes were subjected to vibrational frequency analysis to ensure the
real minima on the potential energy surface. All positive harmonic
vibrational frequencies confirmed the real minima. Based on the ground
state optimized geometries, TDDFT simulations were performed
to evaluate the excitation energies and corresponding oscillator strengths.
The TDDFT simulations were also performed at the same level of theory,
and the solvent effect was included, as used in the experiment. The
experimental CHL solution was mimicked using a polarizable continuum
model, as implemented in Gaussian 09.49,50 The excitation
energies and oscillator strengths for the first 25 singlet–singlet
excitations were evaluated under the TDDFT framework. The input files
were prepared, and the results were visualized using the GaussView
graphical interface.51
