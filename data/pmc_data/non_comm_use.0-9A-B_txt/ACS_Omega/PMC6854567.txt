A series
of methyl 2-[3-(3-phenyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanyl)propanamido]alkanoates
and their corresponding hydrazides and N-alkyl 3-((3-phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanamides
were prepared on the basis of the chemoselective Michael reaction
of acrylic acid with the parent substrate 3-phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione. The parent thione was produced by a convenient
novel thiation method from the corresponding 3-phenylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one. The chemical structures of the newly synthesized
compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, 1H and 13C NMR. The antiproliferative activity of the synthesized
compounds was tested against human HCT-116 and MCF-7 cell lines. Out
of 25 screened derivatives, 10 active compounds exhibited IC50’s in the range 1.9–7.52 μg/mL on the HCT-116,
and 17 active compounds exhibited IC50’s in the
range 2.3–6.62 μg/mL on the MCF-7 cell lines compared
to the reference drug doxorubicin (IC50 3.23 μg/mL).
The structure–activity relationship of the tested compounds
was studied through their binding affinity to the human thymidylate
synthase allosteric site in silico using molecular docking and proved
the quinoxaline ring as a suitable scaffold carrying a peptidomimetic
side chain in position 3.

1 Introduction
Malignancy
is one of the significant factors behind loss of life
in the developed countries.1−3 Chemotherapy with cytotoxic medications
is one of the primary approaches to dealing with established malignancy.4,5 The primary drawbacks of the existing chemotherapy of malignancy
will be the severe poisonous results such as emesis and myelosuppression
and the insufficient selectivity of the drugs against the cyst tumor
cellular material in comparison with the normal cellular material.1,6 Hence, search for newer anticancer drugs is a never-ending job.
Quinazolines are one of the most studied moieties in malignancy chemotherapy.
Lately, the FDA has approved several quinazoline derivatives as antitumor
drugs from previous 15 years such as gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib,
and raltitrexed.7−10

Quinoxaline, an isostere of quinazoline, has also proven to
have
a good anticancer activity in different research studies. Compounds
bearing quinoxaline scaffold have found great application in the discovery
of novel anticancer agents.

Quinoxaline derivatives showed a
good anticancer activity through
different mechanisms including tyrosine kinases inhibition,11−13 C-MET kinase inhibition,14 induction
of apoptosis,15−17 tubulin polymerization inhibition,18 and selective induction of tumor hypoxia.19

Based on the aforementioned data, the present article
deals with
the synthesis of a series of new compounds containing the quinoxaline
moiety, a known isostere for quinazoline, coupled with amino acids
or N-alkyl amines via a propanoyl spacer, to evaluate
their antitumor action. The amino acids used are selected to contain
different physiologically active side chains such as alkyl, carboxyl,
and sulfur-containing groups (glycine, β-alanine, valine, leucine,
aspartic, glutamic, and methionine). The newly synthesized derivatives
were screened for their antitumor activity against HCT-116 and MCF-7
cell lines (Table 1). The mechanism of the antiproliferative activity of the synthesized
compounds was studied through their binding affinity to the human
thymidylate synthase (hTS) allosteric site in silico using molecular
docking.

The chemoselective
reactions of thioamides have always attracted
the attention of our research group. Earlier, we reported20−22 the chemoselective S- and N-alkylation of the model compound 4-methyl-1-thioxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinazolin-5-one with different electrophiles. These results
were supported by quantum-chemical calculations.20−22 We also applied
these findings to the structure modification of a number of heterocyclic
thioamides, quinazolines,23 tetrazoles,24 triazoloquinazolines,20−22,25 and triazoloquinoxalines.26 Nonproteinogenic amino acids are major components in a number of
drugs including β-lactam antibiotics27 and antiviral drugs.28 These results
motivated the development of a series of N- and S-substituted amino
acid esters and alkanamides of a biologically quinoxaline ring system
on the basis of a chemoselective reaction of heterocyclic thioamides
with electrophiles. In the present article, we report the preparation
of methyl-2-[3-(3-phenyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanyl)propanamido]alkanoates
and N-alkyl 3-((3-phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanamides
as promising biologically active compounds.

Key interactions
at protein–protein interfaces constitute
important targets for small molecule inhibition because of their specific
arrangements and biological importance.29

hTS is a homodimeric enzyme that plays a key role in DNA synthesis
and is a target for several clinically important anticancer drugs
which bind to its active site. We have designed peptidomimetics that
have been shown in this molecular modeling study to specifically target
its dimer interface and stabilize its di-inactive form. Peptide30 and nonpeptide31 inhibitors
were demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic studies to bind hTS at
a previously unknown binding site at the homodimer interface and showed
a unique mechanism for the allosteric inhibition of a homodimeric
enzyme through stabilizing its inactive form. This kind of inhibition,
unlike targeting the active site, inhibits intracellular hTS—and
cell growth—without leading to overexpression of the protein
and thereby confers more selectivity and specificity.30

Our compounds are peptides in nature that mimic peptide
inhibitors
and nonpeptide inhibitors together with being more suitable for pharmaceutical
manipulations and development.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Recently, we introduced
an interesting thiating reagent: N-cyclohexyl dithiocarbamate
cyclohexyl ammonium salt 2, which was prepared by the
reaction of cyclohexyl amine and carbon disulfide at room temperature
for 2 h, Scheme 1.32

Scheme 1 Preparation of N-Cyclohexyl
Dithiocarbamate Cyclohexylammonium
Salt 2 as a Novel Thiating Agent
This reagent was used as a novel material for heterocyclic amide–thioamide
transformations.32 Thus, our target substrate
3-phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione (5)
could be simply prepared by thiation of the corresponding 3-phenylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one (3) in a two-step reaction: first, chlorination
and second , heating chloroquinoxaline 4 with 2 in chloroform for 12 h at 61 °C to afford 5 in
excellent yield, Scheme 2.32

Scheme 2 Preparation of the Starting Phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione (5)
The chemical confirmation of this thiation protocol could be achieved
by structure modification of quinoxaline-2(1H)-thione 5 reflecting the thioamide chemical behavior and producing
a series of biologically promising compounds.

3-Phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione (5) displays an interesting tautomeric
equilibrium between thiol (structure 5a) and thione (structure 5b) forms, Scheme 2.33−35 Therefore,
quinoxaline 5 is amenable to structure modification by
simple chemoselective alkylation reactions at the sulfur and nitrogen
atoms. Surprisingly, the reaction of 5 with acrylic acid
derivatives, methyl acrylate, acrylamide, and acrylonitrile in the
presence of triethylamine repeatedly afforded S-alkylated derivatives 6–8 in good yields, Scheme 3. The amide derivative 7 was
also formed by the ammonolysis of the ester 6.

Scheme 3 Chemoselective
S-Alkylation Reactions of Phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione
(5)
Earlier reports dealing
with the chemoselective behavior of heterocyclic
thioamides on the model compound 4-methyl-1-thioxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinazolin-5-one and supported by quantum chemical calculations
showed that the reaction of the model compound with acrylic acid derivatives
afforded the N-substituted products because of strong Coulombic attraction
between the hard part of the ambident nucleophile and the hard electrophile
to finally give N-substitution.20−22 We might conclude that the Michael
reaction of 5 with acrylic acid derivatives gave chemoselective
S-substitution which could be explained by a unique structure of this
quinoxaline structure bearing a phenyl ring that contributes in the
continuous conjugation and consequently, causes both the soft and
hard character to be collected on the sulfur atom.36

The structure assignment of the prepared S-substituted
quinoxaline
derivatives 6–8 is based on 1H and 13C NMR spectral and physicochemical analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of methyl 3-((3-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanoate
(6) gave an aromatic pattern consisting of two doublet
and two multiplet signals at δ 8.13, δ 8.00, δ 7.80–7.65,
and δ 7.55–7.53 ppm for nine aromatic protons. The 1H NMR spectrum of ester 6 also shows two triplet
signals at δ 3.58 and δ 2.89 ppm corresponding to SCH2 and CH2CO groups, respectively, which again confirms
the site of alkylation. On the other hand, the 13C NMR
spectrum of 7 displays two signals at 33.8 and 172.4
ppm for SCH2 and ester carbonyl groups, respectively, and
also aromatic carbons at 154.7, 153.4, 141.5, 139.4, 137.2, 129.8,
129.7, 129.2, 129.0, 128.5, 128.3, and 127.6 ppm. Our experience in
the chemoselective alkylation at nitrogen or sulfur of heterocyclic
thioamides and chemoselective alkylation at nitrogen or oxygen of
heterocyclic amides causes a dramatic change in the aromatic proton
and carbon NMR patterns.20−38 Furthermore, the expected N-substituted ester methyl 3-(3-phenyl-2-thioxoquinoxalin-1(2H)-yl)propanoate should have an extra down fielded carbon
signal of about 178 ppm for the C=S group and a higher chemical
shift of about 42–45 ppm for NCH2.20,21

The S-substituted ester methyl 3-((3-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanoate
(6) is an excellent precursor for the structure modification
of the quinoxaline ring system at the sulfur atom and the introduction
of either amino acid or alkyl amine residues via the azide coupling
method. The azide coupling method is considered as one of the important
methods to couple amino acids and amines starting from the corresponding
hydrazides. It was also reported that this method decreases the degree
of racemization in amino acid coupling.39,40 Thus, the
reaction of ester 6 with hydrazine hydrate in ethyl alcohol
under reflux conditions afforded hydrazide 9 in 88% yield, Scheme 4. Hydrazide 9 was reacted with a NaNO2 and HCl mixture in an
ice bath for 15 min to afford the corresponding azide derivative 10 and was extracted with ethyl acetate. The in situ-generated
ethyl acetate solution of azide 10 was directly reacted
with amino acid methyl ester hydrochlorides in the presence of triethylamine
to afford a series of 2-[3-(3-phenyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanyl)propanamido]alkanoates 11a–g in good yield, Scheme 4. Similarly, the in situ-generated ethyl
acetate solution of azide 10 reacted with alkane amines
at room temperature for 24 h to afford a series of N-alkyl 3-((3-phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanamides 12a–i, Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Preparation
of Methyl 2-[3-(3-Phenyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanyl)propanamido]alkanoates 11a–g and N-Alkyl 3-((3-Phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanamides 12a–i
The structure assignment
of the prepared methyl 2-[3-(3-phenyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanyl)propanamido]alkanoates 11a–g and N-alkyl 3-((3-phenylquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanamides 12a–i is based on 1H and 13C
NMR spectral and physicochemical analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum
of S-substituted glycine 11a shows signals at δ
6.10, δ 3.99, δ 3.67, δ 3.51, and δ 2.70 ppm
corresponding to NH, NHCH2, OCH3, SCH2, and CH2CO groups, respectively. The 13C NMR
spectrum of S-substituted glycine 11a shows signals at
52.3, 41.3, 35.8, and 26.1 ppm for OCH3, NHCH2, SCH2, and CH2CO groups, respectively.

Heterocyclic carboxylic acid hydrazides are well-known biologically
active compounds and were used as intermediates in amino acid coupling
and heterocyclic synthesis.41,42 The reaction of amino
acid esters 11 (a, e, and g) with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol under reflux conditions
afforded the hydrazides 13 (a, e, and g), respectively, in good yields, Scheme 5. Dihydrazide 14 was produced by hydrazinolysis of aspartic acid derivatives 11c, Scheme 6.

2.2 Biological Evaluation
We have examined
the impact of 25 compounds on cancer cell viability and proliferation
by using the MTT assay. The cytotoxic effects of all the compounds
were observed after 48 h treatment and it was found that out of 25
compounds, 10 compounds showed inhibitory action on the HCT-116 cancer
cells, whereas remaining 15 compounds did not show any inhibitory
action on the cancerous cells. We have calculated the IC50 values for these compounds and compound # 9 showed
the highest inhibitory action, whereas compound # 11c showed the lowest inhibitory action on HCT-116 (Table 1).

We have also examined
inhibitory action on MCF-7 cells. We have found that out of 25 compounds,
17 compounds showed inhibitory action on the MCF-7 cancer cells, whereas
remaining 8 compounds did not show any inhibitory action on the cancerous
cells. We have calculated the IC50 values for these compounds
and compound # 11a showed the highest inhibitory action,
whereas compound # 6 showed the lowest inhibitory action
on MCF-7 (Table 1).
Compounds (7, 8, 9, 12h, and 12i) showed a balanced good inhibitory activity
on both the cell lines. There are several reports of treatment of
biomaterials causing cancer cell deaths.43−45

Drug
selectivity is the most important aspect of any treatment,
and we wanted to know whether these synthetically designed compounds
selectively target the cancerous cells or not. We have tested these
compounds on normal healthy cells (HEK-293) using the same concentrations
and durations of treatment. The cell viability assay using MTT revealed
that there are no cytotoxic effects on the normal cell numbers (Supporting Information).

To examine morphological
changes on cancerous cells because of
treatments, we have also studied the cell morphology of HCT-116, MCF-7,
and HEK-293 cells under a light microscope. The treatment of compound
# 7 showed significant changes in the structure of the
cell membrane and the cell nucleus. We observed clear indication of
nuclear disintegration, nuclear condensation, and cell death as many
cancer cells were found dead after the treatment (Figure 1b). The morphology of untreated
(control group) MCF-7 cells remained normal and healthy during the
testing phase (Figure 1c). The treatment of compound 7 showed significant changes
in the structure of the cell membrane and the cell nucleus. We observed
strong nuclear disintegration, nuclear condensation, and cell death
as many cancer cells were found dead after the treatment (Figure 1d). Interestingly,
the morphology of untreated (control group) HCT-116 cells remained
normal and healthy during the testing phase (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 Cell morphology of HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells after
48 h of treatment
with compound # 7: (a) HCT-116 cell control, (b) 2.19
μg/mL (HCT-116), (c) control (MCF-7), and (d) 2.65 μg/mL
(MCF-7). (b,d) show significant cell death; 200 magnification.

Our study suggests that compounds # 9 and 11a showed the highest level of morphological changes
in the HCT-116
and MCF-7 cancerous cells. We do not know the molecular mechanism
of cancer cell death; it would be interesting to study the role of
apoptotic pathways in synthetic compound-mediated cancer cell death.
There are reports of nanoparticle-induced nuclear fragmentation and
disintegration in cancer cells.46,47 We suggest that these
synthetic compounds possess selective targeting capability to cancerous
cells and could be potential candidates for cancer treatments.

All the tested quinoxaline derivatives exhibited good and similar
activity that lies in the low micromolar range. This suggests that
our 3-phenyl-2-sulfanyl quinoxaline scaffold which is present in all
the compounds is presumably working on a specific target and therefore
possesses a good and selective anticancer activity. The change in
the sulfanyl peptidomimetic side chain didn’t greatly affect
activity whether its size (compound 12c compared to compound 12d) or its binding groups type (compound 11c compared to compound 11f). However, the presence of
this side chain is important for its activity (compound 5a compared to compound 7). It seems that the quinaxoline
scaffold is establishing essential interactions with the target active
site and the flexible side chain lies in a spacious channel or pocket
and serves in increasing the overall compound binding and selectivity.

2.3 Molecular Modeling
Bioinformatics,
including molecular modeling studies, has become useful nowadays in
neuroscientific medication discovery, saving cash and effort necessary
for the verification of new compounds by directing and confining the
research to possible focus on/targets. The usage of docking simulation
studies inside our task is quite important to assist in predicting
the possible mode of action of these compounds and guiding the near
future research directions in compound optimization and the biochemical
enzyme assay for the possible target enzymes.48

The tested compounds were evaluated for their binding affinity
to possible targets, namely, hTS active site (4E28) and hTS allosteric
site (3N5E). The compounds were found to preferably bind to the allosteric
site at the homodimer interface. Comparative docking with the target-crystallized
ligand was performed to further validate the docking results and substantiate
the compounds mode of action. The results were also evaluated visually
through possible interaction with key residues at the active site.
Upon computational docking, the inhibitors were found predominantly
at the dimer interface. Although docking poses were found close to
the cocrystallized peptide allosteric inhibitor in the di-inactive
form, docking poses were also found on the opposite side of the dimer
interface. The docking results thus support the hypothesis that inhibitors
could bind to different sites at the dimer interface of the inactive
conformation of hTS.

The docking results showed that the most
active compounds (2, 3, 4, 5, 20, and 21) lie at the interface
of the homodimer in the
same pocket of the crystallized peptide inhibitor and establish interactions
with both chains of the homodimer (Figure 2). The less active compounds had a similar
docking pose; however, they are more shifted toward chain A and therefore
they predominantly established interactions with chain A rather than
binding both chains as the more active compounds did (Figure 3). The inactive compounds are
superposed with the crystallized inhibitor chain that lies in a cleft
further from the interface and deeper inside one of the homodimer.

Figure 2 Compounds 6 purple, 7 orange, 8 pink, 9 light blue, 12h green, and 12i yellow docked in the homodimer interface of hTS with the
cocrystallized peptide inhibitor shown in red.

Figure 3 Inactive
compounds docked in the homodimer interface of hTS.

As an example, compound 7 showed a very interesting
docking pose. This compound was able to bind the homodimer at the
interface and is aligned with the cocrystallized inhibitor. This means
that this compound can simultaneously bind the two homodimer chains
and stabilize the closed inactive conformation (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Compound 7 docked in the homodimer
interface and establishing
interactions with residues at the allosteric site.

Two important hydrogen bonding were noted with the amide
side chain
and PHE154 from chain A and LEU204 from chain B. The quinoxaline ring
represents an anchor group that affects the orientation of the peptidomimetic
side chain in this key position. The quinoxaline ring interacts with
TRP194 through hydrogen bonding and with PHE154 and TRP194 through
π–π and van der Waals interactions. The phenyl
ring is positioned in a lipophilic pocket between PHE154 and LEU204.

The low activity of several compounds carrying bulky and/or long
peptide mimetic side chains could be because of the volume and size
restrictions imposed by residues VAL170. From the abovementioned discussion,
one can conclude the quinoxaline ring is a suitable scaffold for TS
allosteric binding. An aromatic substituent in the position-2 increases
the affinity and selectivity to the enzyme and with careful selection
of the peptide mimetic chain at position-3, we could reach an active
and selective candidate which is suitable for preclinical development.

3 Conclusions
3-Phenylquinoxaline-2(1H)-thione is an interesting
parent substrate obtained by a novel thiation of 3-phenylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one and amenable of simple structure modification by
the Michael reaction with acrylic acid derivatives to afford a number
of S-substituted quinoxaline derivatives including the ester methyl
3-((3-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanoate. A series
of amino acids and their corresponding hydrazides and N-alkyl amine attached to quinoxaline via a propanoyl spacer have
been prepared by the azide coupling method from the corresponding
methyl 3-((3-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinoxalin-2-yl)sulfanyl)propanoate.

The synthesized compounds exhibited promising anticancer activity
with IC50’s in the low micromolar range. The most
active compounds had IC50’s of 1.9 and 2.3 μg/mL
on the HCT-116 and the MCF-7 cell lines, respectively, compared to
the reference drug doxorubicin (IC50 3.23 μg/mL).
In silico studies suggested a possible mode of action through hTS
allosteric inhibition.

Based on the obtained promising anticancer
results and molecular
modeling studies, the current work emphasizes the designed and synthesized
quinoxaline derivatives as novel promising anticancer agents. It is
necessary to extend this study by performing an enzyme-based assay
and in vivo testing to proof the proposed mode of action and guide
compound optimization in terms of selectivity and physicochemical
properties for preclinical development.

A solution of NaNO2 (0.34 g, 5.0 mmol) in cold water (3 mL) was added to a cold solution
(−5 °C) of hydrazide 9 (0.32 g, 1.0 mmol)
in AcOH (6 mL), 1 N HCl (3 mL), and water (25 mL). After stirring
at −5 °C for 15 min, yellowish syrup started to form.
The reaction mixture was stirred in an ice bath for further 1 h. The
reaction mixture was extracted twice with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The
combined organic layer was washed with 0.5 N HCl (30 mL), 3% NaHCO3(30 mL), and H2O (30 mL) and finally dried over
Na2SO4 (10 g) to give an ethyl acetate solution
of azide 10. A solution of an appropriate amino acid
ester hydrochloride (1.0 mmol) in ethyl acetate (20 mL) containing
triethylamine (0.2 mL, 2 mmol) or the appropriate alkane amine (1.0
mmol) in ethyl acetate (20 mL) was added to the solution of azide 10. The mixture was kept at −5 °C for 24 h, then
at 25 °C for another 24 h, followed by washing with 0.5 N HCl
(30 mL), 3% NaHCO3(30 mL), and H2O (30 mL),
and finally dried over Na2SO4 (10 g). The solution
was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was recrystallized from
petroleum ether–ethyl acetate, 1:3, to give the desired S-coupled
products 11 and 12.

4.2 In Vitro Antiproliferative Activity
4.2.1 Cell
Culture & In Vitro Drug Treatments
Human embryonic kidney
cells (HEK-293), human colorectal (colon
cancer) carcinoma cells (HCT-116) and human adenocarcinoma (breast
cancer) cells (MCF-7) were cultured in the media containing DMEM;
(10%) l-glutamine; (10%) fetal bovine serum; (10%) selenium
chloride; (120 unit/mL) penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were cultured
in the CO2 (5%) incubator (Thermo Scientific Heracell-150)
at 37 °C. Then, the cells (HCT-116, MCF-7, and HEK-293) with
70–80% confluence were treated with different concentrations
(2–40 μg/mL) of 38 synthetic compound treatments. The
treated (HCT-116, MCF-7, and HEK-293) cells were analyzed after 48
h intervals.

4.2.2 Microscopic Analysis
All the cells
(HCT-116, MCF-7, and HEK-293) were observed under different magnifications
of an inverted microscope (TS-100F-Eclipse, Nikon, Japan). The structural
morphology of both treated and untreated cells was observed, and we
also examined the structural morphological difference between cancerous
cells (HCT-116 & MCF-7) and healthy normal cells (HEK-293).

4.2.3 Cell Viability by the MTT Assay
All the
cells (HCT-116, MCF-7, and HEK-293) were grown in 96-well
cell culture plates, and once they were 70–80% confluence,
they were treated with 38 synthetic compounds. The cells were treated
with different concentrations of (2–40 μg/mL) of 38 different
compounds. In the control group, synthetic compounds were not added.
After 48 h of treatment, MTT (5.0 mg/mL) was exposed to control and
treated cells and was kept under incubation for 4 h. Then, DMSO was
added to each well and plates were measured at 570 nm wavelength using
the ELISA Plate Reader (Biotek Instruments, Winooski, USA). We have
calculated the percentage (%) of cell viability (%).

4.2.4 Statistical Evaluation
The mean
± standard deviation from the control and compounds 1, 2, and 3 treated groups was calculated.
All the statistical analyses were completed with a GraphPad Prism
6 (GraphPad Software). The difference between the control and compounds 1, 2, and 3 treated groups by a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),and p-values
were calculated by the Student’s t-test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).

4.3 Molecular Modeling and Docking
All
the molecular modeling studies were performed on a Hewlett-Packard
Pentium Dual-Core T4300 2.10 GHz running Windows 10 using autodock
4.3 for molecular docking simulation and ligand binding energy calculation
and Molsoft ICM-Pro 3.5-0 for output data visualization. The crystal
structure of the human TS dimer bound to a short peptide LSCQLYQR
(PDB code: 3N5E) has been chosen as a receptor. This structure is a homodimer, in
its closed conformation, and represents the inactive conformation
of the enzyme. The putative ligand binding site has been assigned
based on the positions of the heavy atoms of the peptide reported.30 The selected targets were used after deleting
the cocrystallized inhibitors. Docking calculations were carried out
using the AutoDock 4.3 software (La Jolla, CA).31 First, all hydrogens were added to the ligand PDB file
and Gasteiger charges were computed and all the torsion angles of
the ligand were defined with the autodock tools program so they could
be explored during molecular modeling. A grid box of 50 × 25
× 25 Å with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å, centered at
the crystallized ligand (X = −43.413 Y = 0.0164 Z = 11.8350) to cover all the
homodimer interface, was used to calculate the atom types needed for
the calculation. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was used as a search
method with a total of 30 runs (maximum of 20 000 000
energy evaluations; 27 000 generations; initial populations
of 150 conformers).

The docking results were evaluated visually
through interaction with key residues and have been calibrated using
crystallized ligands by checking the ligand binding position in Molsoft
ICM-Pro 3.5-0.
