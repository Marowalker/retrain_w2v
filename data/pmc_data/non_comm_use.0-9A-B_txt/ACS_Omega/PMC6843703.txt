In this study, we present willow
wood as a new low-cost, renewable,
and sustainable biomass source for the production of a highly porous
activated carbon for application in energy storage devices. The obtained
activated carbon showed favorable features required for excellent
electrochemical performance such as high surface area (∼2 800
m2 g–1) and pore volume (1.45 cm3 g–1), with coexistence of micropores and
mesopores. This carbon material was tested as an electrode for supercapacitor
application and showed a high specific capacitance of 394 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1 and good cycling stability, retaining ∼94% capacitance after
5 000 cycles (at a current density of 5 A g–1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The prepared carbon material also showed
an excellent rate performance in a symmetrical two-electrode full
cell configuration using 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte,
in a high working voltage of 1.8 V. The maximum energy density and
power density of the fabricated symmetric cell reach 23 W h kg–1 and 10 000 W kg–1, respectively.
These results demonstrate that willow wood can serve as a low-cost
carbon feedstock for production of high-performance electrode material
for supercapacitors.

1 Introduction
Energy
storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors play
a significant role in the development of renewable and sustainable
energy sources such as solar, geothermal, and wind energy.1 Furthermore, due to the ever-growing market for
various portable electronic devices, which have become more and more
power-hungry, the dire need to develop high-performance and efficient
new energy storage sources is critical.2 Supercapacitors or electric double-layer capacitors have become
popular as energy storage devices in a variety of high power output
applications due to their rapid charge–discharge rate, long
cycle life, and high power density.3−5 In addition, supercapacitors
can complement batteries to achieve high power output in a very short
time.1

Carbon-based materials, especially
those derived from activated
carbon (AC), are widely used as electrode materials in most commercial
supercapacitors due to their relatively low cost, high surface area,
and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities.6 The electrochemical performance of ACs in supercapacitors
is greatly dependent on the carbon source and fabrication method.
The desired properties of porosity, electrical conductivity, particle
size, and so forth are achievable by choosing carefully the right
carbon source and by selecting the optimum conditions during the synthesis
of ACs used for the electrode material. Most of the available commercial
ACs are typically produced from fossil fuel-based precursors, such
as coal, polymers, and pitch, which make them expensive and ecologically
unfriendly.7,8 Therefore, there is a desirable need to
find and utilize new renewable and sustainable sources for AC synthesis
designed for supercapacitor electrode applications. Graphene and carbon
nanotubes are frequent choices as electrode materials in supercapacitors.2,9−13 However, due to commonly high production costs and structurally
limited surface area caused by nanoparticle aggregation, their adoption
for large-scale commercialization has largely been hindered.11,14,15

In recent years, research
interests have been focused on the search
for and development of biomass-derived green carbon electrode materials.16,17 Many researchers have already reported the use of various biomass
sources such as rice husk,18,19 cassava peel waste,20 peanut shells,18 coffee
beans,21 bacterial cellulose,22,23 paper pulp mill sludge biowaste,24 chicken
eggshells,25 and so forth as carbon sources
for electrode materials. Compared to traditional fossil-based carbon
sources, biomass is sustainable, structurally porous, abundant, renewable,
and low-cost.7,17 Besides, the majority of biomass
sources are usually rich in heteroatoms such as N, S, P, and O. These
heteroatom-enriched resources can be used to synthesize heteroatom-doped
ACs, additionally providing pseudocapacitance, which can result in
substantially increased overall capacitance.26 Thus, biomass is considered an excellent green source for the fabrication
of high-performance and efficient supercapacitor electrodes, which
are largely based on renewable and sustainable materials. Therefore,
there is still need to find and explore newer sources that are not
only low-cost and sustainable but can easily be controlled structurally
and optimized during the synthesis process. One of the disadvantages
of various biomass sources is that they have different structures,
and therefore, the optimum conditions used to synthesize ACs from
one source cannot necessarily be transferrable to synthesis from another.
Besides, even the same type of source used at different times still
requires different synthesis conditions due to the changing structure.
Therefore, for practical applications, especially at large-scale,
it is also vital to utilize raw biomass sources with easily predictable
and constant structure.

In this regard, we propose willow wood
(WW) as a novel source for
the synthesis of high-performance carbon electrodes for supercapacitors.
Willow (Salix sp.), belongs to the
family of deciduous trees, grows as short rotation coppice,27 and has been investigated mainly as an energy
crop for liquid fuel, heat, and power generation.28 The advantages of utilizing willow as a feedstock include
rapid growth, resulting in high biomass yields, ability to grow on
marginal land areas, and genetic diversity with potential for traditional
breeding and hybridization.27−29 Due to its diverse properties,
willow has also been utilized in water purification30 and as a high-yield source of lignocellulosic sugars and
green aromatics,31 as well as for its traditional
applications providing flexible stems in basket and wicker production.32 The highly valued bark from willow can be utilized
as fiber bundles33 and extracts.34 To the best of our knowledge, WW as a whole
has not been investigated earlier in electrode fabrication for supercapacitors.
Some previous studies, though, have demonstrated the use of different
parts of willow such as willow leaves35 and catkins.36 However, this study demonstrates
the possibility of using WW as a whole as an alternative green source
for electrode fabrication for high-performance supercapacitors.

2 Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 1, a two-step procedure is employed
for the synthesis of the ACs.
The first precarbonization step is responsible for converting WW into
carbon. The yield was calculated to be around 25%. Chemical activation
with KOH of the precarbonized samples is necessary to generate more
micropores and mesopores. Several steps are considered to be involved
during the chemical activation with KOH. The K-containing species,
that is, KOH, K2CO3, and K2O, are
responsible for etching away the carbon matrix via redox reactions
that produce abundant micropores and mesopores. Furthermore, when
the gaseous H2O and CO2 are mixed, they contribute
to the gasification of carbon and further help develop the high porosity.
Finally, the metallic potassium intercalates into the carbon network,
which results in the expansion of carbon structural lattices. After
washing off the intercalated metallic potassium, microporosity is
further enhanced.37,38 The yield after precarbonization
was dependent on the amount of KOH. The yields for the WW-KOH0, WW-KOH1,
WW-KOH3, WW-KOH6, and WW-KOH9 were 78, 70, 63, 60, and 57%, respectively.

Figure 1 Schematic
diagram showing the simple process for the synthesis
of highly porous willow-derived ACs.

The pore structure properties of the activated carbon samples were
revealed using the nitrogen sorption. Figure 2 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution curves of the samples activated
with different ratios of KOH/C. All samples exhibit a type I isotherm
according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.
A steep increase of adsorbed N2 at relatively low pressure
indicates the presence of a large amount of micropores. On raising
the pressure, a gradual increase in adsorption is observed until a
plateau is reached, indicating the presence of mesopores.39 The amount of nitrogen uptake increases with
an increase in the KOH/C ratio from 1 to 9, which corresponds to a
higher surface area and pore volume. However, the increase becomes
minimal at KOH/C ratios of 6 and higher. It is also important to note
that the development of mesoporosity occurs at higher KOH concentrations.
For samples WW-KOH1 and WW-KOH3, micropores occupy about 75%, while
mesopores occupy less than 1%. At higher KOH concentrations, however,
the micropores for WW-KOH6 and WW-KOH9 occupy about 66 and 57%, and
mesopores occupy 33 and 42%, respectively. Further surface area and
porosity characteristics are shown in Table 1. The average pore diameter also increases
with an increase in the KOH/C ratio. This may be attributed to the
expansion of the carbon lattice caused by intercalation of potassium.37 Ion-transport kinetics in electrodes play a
significant role in the performance of supercapacitors. The ion-transport
kinetics is affected by the surface area and pore structure of the
electrode. The combination of both micropores and mesopores, together
with a high specific surface area, is expected to have a significant
effect on the electrochemical performance. The mesopores could serve
as a transport route for fast electrolyte supply, while the micropores
could provide a high surface area for fast ion adsorption, which could
lead to high capacitance.40 It should be
pointed out that the high surface area and pore volume in the studied
WW hybrid (2 800 m2 g–1 and 1.45 cm3 g–1) are higher than those reported for
willow leaves (1 093 m2 g–1 and 0.83
cm3 g–1)35 and willow catkins (1 775 m2 g–1 and
0.85 cm3 g–1).36 As we see from Table 1, increasing the KOH/C ratio beyond 6 does not lead to any observable
change in material properties. Given the practical limits of KOH level
in real-life applications, this can be seen as an advantage as further
seeking to optimize at higher KOH levels is unlikely to improve the
performance. Therefore, other methods of optimization are recommended
such as temperature control, hydrothermal pretreatment, and so forth,
which can be an avenue for future research.

The morphology and microstructures
were examined by SEM. Figure 3 shows the SEM images
of all samples prepared at the various ratios of KOH/C. At low magnifications,
all samples seem to have a similar microstructure. However, it is
clear that, with an increase in the KOH/C ratio a highly microporous
structure can be visualized at higher magnifications. At a KOH/C ratio
of 9, for example, it is visibly clear that the surface is covered
with small-sized micropores. The results are consistent with that
of nitrogen sorption. Further SEM images of the samples are shown
in the Supporting Information, Figure S1.

resolutions: (a–c) WW-KOH0; (d–f) WW-KOH1; (g–i)

Raman spectroscopy reveals two distinct bands at ∼1
350
and ∼1 590 cm–1 (Figure 4) corresponding to the D-band and G-band,
respectively. The D-band represents the defects and disorder in the
carbon structures, while the G-band is due to the in-plane vibrations
of ordered sp2-bonded carbon atoms. The intensity ratio
of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) is used to estimate the quantity of defects and degree
of graphitization of the samples.41 The
amount of KOH used in the activation process does not seem to have
a detrimental effect on the degree of structural order in the carbonized
materials, shown by a similar ID/IG ratio throughout. However, a slight decrease
in the ID/IG ratio is observed as the amount of KOH increases, indicating that
the degree of graphitization slightly improves at a higher amount
of KOH.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of the prepared samples showing the correlation with
the ID/IG ratio.

X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), in turn,
reveals the species
and chemical states on the surface of the activated carbon samples,
as shown in Figure 5. The broad spectra for all samples (Figure 5a) show the presence of two distinct peaks
at around 285 and 531 eV, corresponding to carbon and oxygen, respectively. Figure 5b shows the high-resolution
C 1s of the WW-KOH9 sample deconvoluted into four peaks, located,
respectively, at 284.4 (C=C), 285.4, (C–O), 288.8 (C=O),
and 290.8 eV (O=C–O).42 The
high-resolution C 1s data for the remaining samples can be found in
the Supporting Information, Figure S2.
The resulting elemental concentrations of carbon and oxygen in the
samples are summarized in Table 2. The more detailed results of XPS showing the functional
groups can be seen in Table S1. A slight
decrease in carbon content and corresponding increase in oxygen are
observed when the amount of KOH increased. The higher oxygen content
is expected to improve the wettability of the carbon samples and lead
to an efficient penetration of electrolyte into the pores of the electrode,
which, in turn, should translate to higher capacitance. Moreover,
the presence of heteroatoms could also contribute to an increased
overall capacitance by means of pseudocapacitance.

The electrochemical
performance of all prepared carbon samples
was analyzed in a three-electrode configuration system in 6 M KOH
electrolyte. Figure 6 shows the electrochemical survey conducted for all samples, evaluated
with CV, GCD, and EIS methods. CV curves representing measurements
at a sweep rate of 100 mV s–1 for all samples are
depicted in Figure 6a. The typical rectangular CV curves are found especially for samples
with higher KOH/C ratio, indicating an excellent reversible capacitive
behavior. It is also important to note that the enclosed CV areas
are increasing in proportion to the amount of KOH and retain a more
pronounced rectangular shape and, thus, a greater specific capacitance.
This is not surprising, considering that the highest surface area
and pore volume were achieved with samples activated at higher KOH/C
ratios.

configuration. (a) Cyclic voltammetry at scan rate of 100 mV s–1. (b) Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycle

as a function of current density. (d) Nyquist plot of the imaginary
and real parts of impedance with the inset showing the high-frequency
region.

The GCD curves at a current density
of 1 A g–1 are shown in Figure 6b. Samples WW-KOH1 and WW-KOH2 show a rather
symmetrical triangular
form, while WW-KOH6 and WW-KOH9 show a quasi-symmetrical shape. This
effect is caused by heteroatom doping, that is, oxygen, in this case.
XPS analysis showed that the amount of oxygen was highest at the higher
KOH/C ratios of 6 and 9. The oxygen-containing functional groups provide
pseudocapacitance, which contributes additionally to the total capacitance
and can cause the GCD curves, especially at low current density, to
deviate from the symmetrical triangular shape. It has been shown that
pseudocapacitance from oxygen functional groups is caused by a quinone/hydroquinone
redox pair.43 A similar phenomenon was
also reported for nitrogen-doped activated carbon.44 The GCD curves show that samples WW-KOH6 and WW-KOH9 have
the longest charge and discharge cycles, which implies best electrochemical
performance in comparison to the other samples. This finding was further
supported by calculating the specific capacitance at various current
densities for all samples, as shown in Figure 6c. The gravimetric capacitance (Cg) from the charge–discharge cycles for the three-electrode
system was calculated using eq 1. 1  where I (A) is the discharge
current, Δt (s) is the discharge time, ΔV (V) voltage difference, and m (g)
is the mass of the active material.The specific capacitance of WW-KOH9
and WW-KOH6 is significantly higher than the rest of the samples at
all current densities. For example, the specific capacitances at a
current density of 1 A g–1 for WW-KOH1, WW-KOH2,
WW-KOH6, and WW-KOH9 are 95, 133, 352, and 392 F g–1, respectively.

Figure 6d shows
the Nyquist plot obtained from EIS in the frequency range of 0.01
Hz–1 MHz with the inset showing the magnification of the high-frequency
region. The vertical line in the low-frequency region is more closely
parallel to the Z″ axis for WW-KOH6 and WW-KOH9,
which indicates that a nearly perfect capacitive behavior is obtained.
On the other hand, the vertical lines are sloping away from the y axis for samples WW-KOH1 and WW-KOH2, indicating a poor
capacitive behavior due to the low pore volume and surface area. The
intercept of the Nyquist plot with the x axis is
normally used to estimate the equivalent series resistance (ESR),45 which is the combination of the interfacial
resistance of the electrode material and ionic resistance of electrolyte.
The intermediate- to high-frequency region represents the charge transfer
resistance. All samples recorded very low ESR values in the range
of 0.36–0.46 Ω. The diameter of the semicircle in the
middle-frequency region indicates the sum of bulk electrolyte resistance
and charge transfer resistance. By comparing the shapes in Figure 6d (inset), it is
clear that WW-KOH9 has the smallest semicircle indicating the lowest
charge transfer resistance. A straight line at a slope of about 45°
in the low-frequency region follows the Warburg response, which is
due to ion transport and diffusion resistance inside the intraparticle
pores of the electrode.46 Again, WW-KOH9
displays a smaller Warburg region in comparison to other samples indicating
a more efficient ion diffusion process caused by high surface area
and a well-developed pore structure consisting of micropores and mesopores.

It is clear that WW-KOH9 and WW-KOH6 outperform all other samples
based on all the conducted analyses. However, WW-KOH9 just slightly
performs better than WW-KOH6, and therefore, the following tests focus
on WW-KOH9. The CV curves are shown in Figure 7a at various sweep rates. The CV profiles
retain a rectangular shape at all sweep rates from 10 to 200 mV s–1, demonstrating an excellent capacitive behavior with
a high reversible adsorption and desorption rate of electrolyte ions
onto the electrode. Moreover, the absence of oxidation and reduction
peaks indicates the dominance of an electrical double-layer capacitance.
The GCD curves at current densities ranging from 1 to 20 A g–1 are shown in Figure 7b. The nearly linear and symmetrical curves at all current densities
indicate an excellent electrical double-layer behavior and a high
Coulombic efficiency. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 100
A g–1, WW-KOH9 still shows a high capacitance of
250 F g–1, indicating an excellent rate capability
(Figure 6c). The dependence
of the phase angle on the frequency is shown in Figure 7c. The characteristic frequency f0 for a phase angle of −45° corresponds to
the time constant of 0.28 s (τ0 = 1/f0). This frequency represents the point at which the resistive
and capacitive impedance components are equal, and, at frequencies
higher than f0, the supercapacitor transitions
to a more resistive behavior.47 This low
time constant shows a high rate capability of the prepared electrode
material. The cycling test shown in Figure 7d illustrates that the electrode is able
to retain ∼94% of the initial capacitance after 5 000
cycles at a high current density of 5 A g–1, showing
an excellent cycling stability.

charge–discharge curves at the start and end of cycles.

To demonstrate its electrochemical performance
further, WW-KOH9
was tested in a symmetrical two-electrode supercapacitor system with
a glass fiber separator and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Figure 8a exhibits the CV
curves of the constructed WW-KOH9-based supercapacitor operated at
various scan rates in a potential range of 0 and 1.8 V. It can be
seen that, at all scan rates, near ideal rectangular curves can be
obtained without any obvious distortions or redox peaks, indicating
that the electrochemical performance of WW-KOH9 is largely dominated
by the electrical double-layer capacitance. Furthermore, the GCD curves
in Figure 8b at different
current densities display linear and symmetrical triangular shapes,
indicating excellent electrochemical double-layer behavior. The specific
capacitances calculated from the GCD curves at various current densities
are shown in Figure 8c. The specific capacitance decreases from 201 to 154 F g–1 as the current density increases from 0.5 to 20 A g–1, respectively, equivalent to a 77% retention, which indicates a
very high rate capability. These results are superior to many representative
carbon-based supercapacitors tested in the Na2SO4 electrolyte.44,48−50 Even at a very
high current density of 20 A g–1, WW-KOH9 still
shows a very high specific capacitance of 154 F g–1, again indicating the excellent rate performance. The Nyquist plot
from the EIS is shown in Figure 8d, with the inset showing the magnification of the
high-frequency region. A nearly vertical line in the low-frequency
region is observed, confirming an ideal capacitive behavior of electrochemical
double-layer capacitor due to high pore volume and advantageous pore
size distribution. Moreover, a very low ESR value of 0.4 Ω is
found, indicating good electron conduction and fast ion exchange between
the electrode and electrolyte. Furthermore, the dependence of the
phase angle on the frequency is presented in Figure 8e. At low frequency, the phase angle is −82.4°,
which is close to that of an ideal capacitor of −90°.
Energy density is directly proportional to the square of the operational
potential. Therefore, we see that using Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte with a maximum working potential of 1.8 V increases
sharply the energy density compared with the KOH electrolyte, which
has 1 V working potential.

The energy density E (W h kg–1) and power density P (W kg–1)
are calculated from specific capacitance using eqs 2 and 3, respectively. 2   3  where Cg is the
specific capacitance (F g–1), V is the cell potential (V), and Δt is the
discharge time (s). The Ragone plot in Figure 8f shows that the WW-KOH9 electrode supercapacitor
produces a high energy density of ∼23 W h kg–1 at a power density of ∼223 W kg–1, which
is higher than most of the previously reported carbon-based symmetric
supercapacitors in aqueous electrolytes.50,51

The superior electrochemical performance of the WW-KOH9 electrode
can be attributed to the synergy of the high specific surface area
and the optimal combination of micropores and mesopores. Moreover,
the presence of oxygen also contributes to the overall capacitance
and improves the wettability of the electrode by the electrolyte.
The high content of micropores in WW-KOH9 plays a significant role
in optimizing the electrical double-layer surfaces and in increasing
the specific capacitance in an aqueous electrolyte for maximum adsorption
of ions, and the mesopores provide an enrichment of interconnected
channels with the micropores, which facilitates a rapid electrolyte
transfer and penetration into the micropores of the electrode.52

3 Experimental Part
3.1 Materials and Preparation
Poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), potassium
hydroxide (KOH), and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon black Super P was purchased
from Nanografi. The WW used in this study was a one-year-old willow
hybrid “Klara” harvested from the plantation of Carbons
Finland Oy that is located in Kouvola, a city in southern Finland,
on May 18, 2017. The willow was debarked immediately after harvesting.
The dried debarked WW was ground into powder before carbonization
using a Wiley mill. A two-step carbonization process was employed.
The schematic preparation of the activated carbons is shown in Figure 1. The WW was first
precarbonized at 600 °C for 1 h at a heating rate of 5 °C
min–1 under nitrogen flow. After carbonization,
the samples were washed with deionized water and dried at 105 °C.
Then, KOH was dissolved in about 20 mL of water and thoroughly mixed
with the dried precarbonized carbon in various KOH/C mass ratios of
0, 1, 3, 6, and 9. The mixed samples were then dried at 105 °C
until completely dry followed by activation at 800 °C for 1 h
at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 under nitrogen
flow and allowed to cool down to room temperature naturally. After
carbonization, the samples were thoroughly washed with 1 M hydrochloric
acid and subsequently with deionized water until neutral pH. The powders
were finally dried at 105 °C before further analysis. The resulting
activated carbon samples are designated as WW-KOH0, WW-KOH1, WW-KOH3,
WW-KOH6, and WW-KOH9, with the numeration corresponding to the KOH/C
ratios.

3.2 Materials Characterization
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the structure and morphology
of the carbon powders using a Zeiss Sigma VP at 5 kV acceleration
voltage. The samples were sputtered with platinum to form a conducting
film prior to SEM measurements. Raman spectra were collected using
a WITec alpha300 R Raman microscope (alpha 300, WITec, Ulm, Germany)
equipped with a piezoelectric scanner employing a 532 nm linear polarized
excitation laser. The Raman spectral analysis was performed directly
on the prepared carbon powders. Surface area and pore volume were
determined using a Micromeritics Tristar II apparatus based on the
BET gas sorption method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was
conducted using a Kratos Axis Ultra ESCA system with a monochromatic
Al-Kα source.

3.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical properties were studied using both the conventional
two- and three-electrode systems. In the three-electrode system, the
active carbon material was placed as the working electrode, and a
Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference
electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared by
mixing 80 wt % as-prepared carbon materials with 10 wt % conductive
carbon black Super P and 10 wt % PVDF dissolved in NMP. The working
electrode was prepared by coating the slurry on nickel foam, dried
at 105 °C, and pressed before the electrochemical measurements
in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The mass loading of the active electrode
was in the range of 15–20 g m–2. All the
electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature. Galvanostatic
charge–discharge (GCD), cycling tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV),
and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were
carried out in a Gamry Reference 600+ potentiostat/galvanostat/ZRA.
For the two-electrode system, two symmetrical electrodes, each measuring
15 × 15 mm2, were prepared the same way as described
above with a glass fiber separator in between the two electrodes,
which was previously soaked in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.

4 Conclusions
In this work, willow wood was
successfully applied as a carbonaceous
biomass feedstock for the synthesis of high surface area and pore
volume activated carbon for application in electrode materials for
supercapacitors. The obtained activated carbon has a high surface
area of up to 2793 m2 g–1 and pore volume
of up to ∼1.45 cm3 g–1, with a
unique combination of micropores and mesopores. This carbon material
showed an excellent electrochemical performance. It showed a specific
capacitance of 395 F g–1 at a current density of
1 A g–1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and, even at an
ultrahigh current density of 100 A g–1, a high specific
capacitance of 250 F g–1 is still retained, indicating
an excellent rate performance. Even in the full cell two-electrode
configuration, the obtained activated carbon showed excellent electrochemical
performance. The specific capacitance at 1 A g–1 was 197 F g–1, dropping to 154 F g–1 at a current density of 20 A g–1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, this supercapacitor
with an aqueous electrolyte yielded a maximum energy density of 23
W h kg–1 and a maximum power density of 10 000 W
kg–1. These results demonstrate that willow wood
has high potential for application as electrode in supercapacitors.
The simplicity of the synthesis procedure also demonstrates the possibility
for large-scale production. This study also indicates that willow
wood is a promising material from which with further development and
improvement, the performance of carbon-based derivatives can be competitive
with the already known industrial technological standards.
