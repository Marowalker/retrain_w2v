A polystyrene (PS)-based
composite resin dosimeter (CRD) film comprising
2-(phenylamino)-6-(dipentylamino)-3-methylspiro[9H-xanthene-9,3′-phthalide] (Black305) fluoran leuco dye, cerium-doped
yttrium aluminum perovskite YAlO3:Ce (YAP:Ce) scintillator,
and 2-(4-methoxystyryl)-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine (MBTT)
photoacid generator was developed for the visualization of X-ray exposure
doses in the range of 18–170 Gy. The color of the CRD film
changed from yellow to black within this range based on the X-ray
exposure dose. A CRD film based on Black305/YAP:Ce/MBTT/PS could be
used to produce a dosimeter with various color change sensitivities
by controlling the thermodynamic parameters of the constituent materials.
A CRD film is a promising tool for measuring the X-ray exposure dose
and can be used as an alternative to the existing radiochromic dosimeters.

Introduction
In the scientific sense,
ionizing radiation is a general term for
particles with high energy that are traveling at high speed (particle
beam) and electromagnetic waves of short wavelength with high energy.
Ionizing radiation is invisible and not directly detected by human
senses; thus, it cannot be visually recognized except by special equipment.
Ionizing radiation is harmful to human body, so radiation workers
must be able to measure the ionizing radiation. In general, a Geiger–Muller
counter or a semiconductor radiation detector device is used for detecting
weak radiation. In addition, radiochromic dosimeters (radiation color
dosimeters) can recognize the presence or absence of radiation only
by visual observation and have been widely used in the fields of radiation
therapy and sterilization. A radiochromic dosimeter is one type of
chemical dosimeter. Currently, plastic film dosimeters1−6 and Fricke dosimeters7−9 are known as radiochromic dosimeters. Poly(methyl
methacrylate) dosimeters can be used in the high-dose region, whereas
Fricke dosimeters can be used in the low-dose region. In addition,
the most popular fluoroglass dosimeter requires a dedicated reading
device to recognize the radiation exposure dose and has a fatal disadvantage
in that the radiation exposure dose cannot be known immediately. Therefore,
a new system that differs from the existing radiation dosimeters that
can visually, intuitively, or stably confirm the radiation exposure
dose is needed to overcome these problems.

We developed a composite
resin dosimeter (CRD), which is a kind
of radiochromic dosimeter, using photoreversible spiropyran dye, 6-nitro
BIPS, and BaFCl:Eu2+ for detecting the low-dose radiation.10−14 However, in this proposed CRD, the colored form of the photoreversible
6-nitro BIPS was thermally unstable, and there was a problem in preserving
the recorded exposure doses. Fluoran leuco dyes are well-known chromogenic
compounds used as color formers for pressure and thermosensitive data-recording
systems. Fluoran leuco dyes have been used as thermochromic materials
in a mixture consisting of two materials: a color former (fluoran
leuco dyes) and a color developer (proton donor).15−17 In the presence
of protons, the colorless leuco form in the fluoran leuco dye undergoes
a ring-opening reaction to form the corresponding highly colored zwitterionic
dye form.16−21 Furthermore, the zwitterionic dye forms are thermally stable in
a partially protic microenvironment at lower temperatures and in the
solid phase, but the records on media slowly fade over the years.22

In this study, we propose a CRD film with
thermally stable and
irreversible color change properties based on the X-ray exposure dose
using a color former (fluoran leuco dye), a scintillator (YAlO3:Ce), and a photoacid generator (or proton donor) (MBTT).

Experimental
Section
All chemicals were commercially available and used
as received.
The fluoran leuco dye 2-(phenylamino)-6-(dipentylamino)-3-methylspiro[9H-xanthene-9,3′-phthalide] (Black305) was purchased
from Fukui Yamada Chemical Co., Japan, and used as a color former.
Cerium-doped yttrium aluminum perovskite YAlO3:Ce (YAP:Ce)
scintillating powder was purchased from Ohyo Koken Kogyo Co., Japan,
and used as an X-ray acceptor and UV-emitting phosphor. 2-(4-Methoxystyryl)-4,6-bis(trichloromethyl)-1,3,5-triazine
(MBTT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used as a photoacid
generator and UV acceptor. Toluene and polystyrene (PS) were purchased
from Wako Co., Japan. Black305 (0.63 g), MBTT (0.50 g), and PS (5.00
g) were dissolved in a toluene solvent (20.00 g), and the mixture
was stirred for 12 h. Subsequently, YAP:Ce scintillating powder (2.24
g) was added to the mixture and then the air in the mixture was homogenized
and degassed entirely using a planetary centrifugal mixer (ARE-310,
Thinky Co., Japan) operating at 2000 rpm with polyethylene balls (1/2
in.) for 30 min. The mixed suspension was cast on a Teflon sheet and
dried at room temperature for 3 days to prepare a composite film.
All procedures were conducted in the dark.

The particle size
distribution of the YAP:Ce powder and the cross
section of the CRD film were characterized using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) (S-3000, Hitachi Co., Japan). The powder diameter
and size distribution (N = 100) were measured from
the SEM image and analyzed with image processing software (ImageJ
and Mintub). The UV–visible absorption, reflectance, and transmittance
spectra were recorded on a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
(Lambda 1050, Perkin Elmer Co.), a multichannel spectrometer (HSU-100,
Asahi Spectra Co., Japan), and an FTIR spectrophotometer (FTIR-4700
with ATR PRO ONE equipped with a diamond prism, Jasco Co., Japan),
respectively. Cross section images of the sample were observed using
a digital microscope (KH-8700, Hirox Co., Japan). The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the YAP:Ce scintillating powder was measured at a
scan rate of 0.5° s–1 using an X-ray diffractometer
(RINT2500, Rigaku Co., Japan) with monochromated Cu Kα X-rays
operating at 40 kV and 50 mA. The X-ray excited optical luminescence
(XEOL) spectrum was measured using a photonic multichannel analyzer
(Ocean Optics Co., USB4000, Japan) through fused silica fiber (Ocean
Optics Co., P400-2-UV–VIS, Japan) upon irradiation with an
X-ray of 0.154 nm (RINT2500, Rigaku Co., Japan) at an operating rate
of 40 kV and 50 mA at room temperature. An X-ray of 0.154 nm from
RINT2500 was also used as a radiation source, and the radiation dosage
of the X-rays per unit time was estimated to be 2.12 Gy min–1 based on the change in the absorbance of a Fricke solution.13,14 During X-ray exposure, the photographs of the changing color of
the CRD film were taken with a digital camera (TG-3 CMIIT, OLYMPUS
Co., Japan), and their chromaticity differences (ΔE) were evaluated with an image-processing software (Photoshop CS3,
Adobe Systems Co.).

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
change in the UV–visible absorption spectrum of Black305 in
tetrachloroethylene (10 mL, 1.95 × 10–3 M)
before and after acidification with HCl (0.05 mL, 1.17 × 10–1 M) at room temperature. Before acidification with
HCl, the absorption spectrum of the Black305 solution shows no absorption
band in the visible region, and the solution is completely colorless
and transparent. After acidification with HCl, the absorption spectrum
of the Black305 solution shows absorption bands with peaks at 451
and 589 nm, and the color of the solution changed to black. The color
change indicates the spiro carbon–oxygen (C–O) bond
in the lactone ring of the colorless leuco form was cleaved, and subsequent
isomerization leads to a colored zwitterionic structure in the so-called
dye form. The absorption band at 589 nm is mainly assigned to the
excitation from the aromatic ring involving the phenyl amino group
to the xanthene and phthalide moieties. The absorption band at 451
nm is attributed to a decrease in the electron density of the pyran
ring and dipentyl aniline.23,24 Note that the colored
dye form is irreversible and does not return to the colorless leuco
form unless OH– is added to the solution.

Figure 2 shows
the
UV–visible absorption spectrum of MBTT in acetone. The absorption
peak centered at 373 nm is mainly attributed to triazine and phenyl
ring π–π* transitions. Upon light irradiation at
373 nm, cleavage of a C–Cl bond in CCl3 occurs and
then the chlorine radical Cl• is created and reacts
with the solvent or host polymer to eventually yield H+ protons The mechanism of photoacid generation of MBTT is analogous
to photoacid generation for triazine in the literature.26,27

Figure 3a shows
the morphology of a YAP:Ce powder measured by SEM, in which a regularly
semispherical shape with a smooth surface can be observed. The inset
shows the particle size distribution determined by an analysis of
the SEM image of the YAP:Ce powder, indicating homogeneous particles
in the size range from 1 to 7 μm with an average particle diameter
of 2 μm. Figure 3b shows the XRD pattern of the YAP:Ce powder, which contains several
diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 24.0, 26.9, 33.7, 34.3, 41.9,
42.7, 49.1, 50.7, and 56.2° that correspond to diffraction from
the (020), (111), (200), (121), (220), (022), (202), (212), and (311)
planes, respectively. The XRD pattern of the YAP:Ce powder corresponds
to an orthorhombic structure and is in good agreement with the crystallographic
analysis using Jade 6 software. In addition, the absolute fluorescence
quantum yield of YAP:Ce at an excitation wavelength of 275 nm was
measured.28 The YAP:Ce powder is a well-known
near-ultraviolet light emitting scintillator.29,30Figure 3c shows that
the YAP:Ce powder has strong photoluminescence peaks at 350 and 375
nm when excited with X-ray irradiation of 0.154 nm at room temperature.
The doped Ce3+ ion in YAP shows that photoluminescence
is strongly dependent on its valence state and the nature of the host
lattice. The doublet bands at 350 and 375 nm are ascribed to the typical
5d (2F5/2) > 4f (2F7/2) luminescence of the doped Ce3+ ion.31 Accordingly, the strong photoluminescence at 350 and 375
nm can overlap with the region in which MBTT can induce photoacid
generation; thus, the YAP:Ce powder would form an appropriate donor–acceptor
relationship with MBTT for photoacid generation.

size distribution of YAP:Ce. (b) X-ray
diffraction pattern of the YAP:Ce powder. (c) XEOL spectra of the
YAP:Ce powder before and after irradiation with a 0.154 nm X-ray (40
kV, 50 mA).

The morphology of the
CRD film and size distribution of the YAP:Ce
particles were determined from the SEM images, and the film thickness
was measured from the cross-sectional digital microscope image. Figure 4a shows an optical
microscope photograph of the surface of the CRD film. The surface
of the CRD film has a uniform yellow color, which is responsible for
the absorption characteristics of the MBTT contained in the CRD film.
In addition, Black305 is uniformly present in the CRD film; however,
it is not visible because the leuco form of Black305 is colorless
before isomerization. Figure 4b shows a digital microscope photograph of a cross section
in the thickness direction of the CRD film. The film thickness was
measured to be 200 μm, and the CRD film has small YAP:Ce particles
that are homogeneously distributed. The SEM image of the CRD film
is given in Figure 4c, indicating that the particles agglomerate with a size of 1–6
μm. To confirm the material composition of the CRD film, energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was performed. The EDS mapping corresponding
to the observed agglomerates shows a substantial presence of yttrium
(Y), as shown in Figure 4e. The homogeneously dispersed carbon (C) is detected in the film,
as shown in Figure 4d. Based on these findings, the particle agglomeration of YAP:Ce
observed in the SEM and EDS images was localized in the matrix, whereas
Black305, MBTT, and PS existed throughout the CRD film. Furthermore,
the findings suggest that the dimensions of the particles match the
initial size of the raw YAP:Ce powder. Consequently, the YAP:Ce particles,
Black305, and MBTT were uniformly dispersed in the PS film along the
thickness direction.

The coloration behavior of the CRD film was confirmed by
UV light
irradiation using a 360 nm UV light. As a result, the CRD film changed
from yellow to black and showed good coloration behavior under UV
light irradiation, as shown in Figure S1. The relationship between the chromaticity difference ΔE and the absorbed dose in Fricke solution (dose–response
curve) for the CRD film was determined based on the time variation
of the absorbed dose and ΔE.

Figure 5a shows
the visualization appearance of the CRD film for the X-ray exposure
at an interval of 40 Gy (see Movie S1 in
the Supporting Information). The black area indicates the X-ray exposure
area, which is in good agreement with the size of the X-ray radiation
region of the X-ray diffractometer, and the yellow area is the unirradiated
area. The chemical aspect of the color change in the CRD film was
investigated by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared
(ATR-FTIR) analysis. Figure 5b shows the ATR-FTIR spectra for the CRD film before and after
X-ray exposure for 120 Gy. The ATR-FTIR spectrum of the as-prepared
(before X-ray exposure) CRD film shows transmittance at 3025, 2924,
1749, 1601, 1493, 1453, 757, and 699 cm–1. These
bands are assigned to aromatic C–H stretching (3025 cm–1), terminal methylene C–H stretching (2924
cm–1), C = O stretching (1749 cm–1), C=C stretching (1601 and 1493 cm–1),
C–H stretching (1453 cm–1), C–H bending
(1450 cm–1), and C–H out-of-plane bending
in the aromatic ring (757 and 699 cm–1) for the
CRD film before X-ray exposure. Upon X-ray exposure, the transmittances
of O–H stretching (3299 cm–1) and C=O
stretching (1749 cm–1) are significantly changed
by X-ray exposure, indicating that cleavage of the spiro carbon–oxygen
(C–O) bonds occurs at room temperature. Figure 5c shows the UV–visible reflectance
spectra of the CRD film during X-ray exposure. The reflectance spectra
were measured at an interval of 10 Gy. Before light irradiation, the
broad reflection band where the reflection bands of PS and MBTT overlap
appears in the region <532 nm. During X-ray exposure, the color
of the CRD film gradually changes to black with increasing X-ray exposure
dose, and the reflection spectra are attributed to the colored dye
form of Black305 shown in Figure 1. The time dependence of reflectance at 610 nm in the
dark after X-ray irradiation is shown on the right side of Figure 5c. The intensities
indicate a high stability without a change for 40 h. Detailed studies
on post-irradiation stability of the CRD film have not been conducted
yet. However, the CRD film showed no color change unless exposed to
ultraviolet light or X-rays and was stable for at least 1 year. Consequently,
the present CRD film possesses chemically and thermally stable characteristics
and has properties that is are superior to those of the currently
proposed CRD films based on spiropyran dye.

to 0.252 Gy–1. The plot shows the experimental values.
(g) A plot of the intersection point of ΔE =

Figure 5d shows
the plots of the changing chromaticity difference ΔE as a function of the absorbed dose in the CRD film. A kinetic model
considering a two-step consecutive first-order reaction was applied
as follows 1  In this
scheme, the second and third steps
are slow thermodynamic processes, which can be regarded as the rate-limiting
steps relative to the first fast photolysis step, which controls the
leuco-H of the final product that contributes to the chromaticity
difference ΔE. Therefore, the dose–response
profile was fit with the two-step first-order consecutive reaction
model 2  where
ΔE is the chromaticity
difference, ΔE∞ is the steady
state of the chromaticity difference, k1 and k2 are the rate (dose–response)
constants, and D is the absorbed dose in the Fricke
solution. The CRD film exhibits a good response to the chromaticity
difference for X-ray exposure. Furthermore, the dose–response
curve can be fitted to the two-step first-order consecutive reaction
model. The curve fit by the model to data has a correlation efficiency
of R2 = 0.98. The parameter values determined
for the model are k1 = 0.33 Gy–1 and k2 = 0.014 Gy–1. From this result, this coloring reaction can be predicted as follows.
The Cl• generated during X-ray exposure reacts immediately
with RH (polystyrene) according to k1 to
produce H+, and subsequently, H+ reacts with
the colorless fluoran leuco dye to slowly generate the colored fluoran
leuco-H dye according to k2, as shown
in Figure 5e. Thus,
the color of the CRD film is changed from yellow to black according
to the X-ray exposure doses. According to the index of the CRD film
proposed thus far, a maximum color change sensitivity S has been defined as ΔE = 10; thus, S is estimated to be 18 Gy. In addition, the dynamic range
of this CRD film is 18–170 Gy, corresponding to the change
in ΔE. The maximum color change sensitivity S of the present CRD film is 200 times lower than that of
0.1 Gy for a CRD film based on the 6-nitro BIPS/BaFCl:Eu2+/PS with four types of photophysical and photochemical processes.13 The present CRD film contains a photoacid generation
process, which would result in significantly reducing the color change
sensitivity. Furthermore, as an important feature here, it is expected
that the CRD films with various radiation color change sensitivities
can be produced by controlling the thermodynamic parameters occurring
in the color change process. For example, by controlling the dose–response
constant k2, it is possible to improve
the maximum color change sensitivity up to 3 Gy, as shown in Figure 5f,g. In addition,
it should be noted here that the simulated dose–response curves
and their plots also suggest that the dynamic range is significantly
reduced as a compensation for higher color change sensitivity. That
is, it also means that an appropriate material design according to
the use environment and applications is an important research subject.
The water content of dosimeters can affect the dosimeter response
as well.32 Therefore, the effect of humidity
on the dose–response of the CRD film will need to be considered
in the future. The present findings also provide thermally stable
and irreversible color change according to the X-ray exposure doses
compared with the conventional CRD film, and it can be expected to
be utilized as an alternative device for individual radiation dose-monitoring
tools.

We propose a mechanism for the color change behavior
of the CRD
film based on Black305/YAP:Ce/MBTT/PS during X-ray exposure, as shown
in Figure 6. The YAP:Ce
scintillating powder absorbs the irradiated radiation (X-ray or γ-ray)
in the CRD film, and a part of the absorbed radiation energy is converted
into ultraviolet light emission. MBTT absorbs the converted ultraviolet
light, and then a photoacid-generating reaction takes place to produce
a H+ proton. The produced H+ diffuses and reacts
with Black305 to cleave the lactone ring of the colorless leuco form
in Black305 and give the dye form a black color. As a result, the
absorbed radiation area gradually changes to black according to the
absorbed dose, and its color change can be visually observed at approximately
18 Gy. In addition, the colored area is stable in the range from room
temperature to 90 °C and can be held at these temperatures. The
color-changing mechanism progresses through complicated photophysical
and photochemical processes and subsequent diffusion and reaction
of H+. Therefore, the material design concept concerning
the Black305/YAP:Ce/MBTT/PS system may provide a new combination of
dosimeter-oriented materials with various color change sensitivities
that are a function of their efficiencies, diffusion coefficients,
and thermodynamic parameters for each process.

Conclusions
A PS-based CRD film with color change sensitivities
in the range
of 18–170 Gy was successfully prepared. The color of the CRD
film changed from yellow to thermally stable black within a range
corresponding to the X-ray exposure dose. The ability to visualize
X-ray exposure helps to address an urgent situation for nuclear plant
workers facing the risk of excessive radiation exposure, including
those in Japan.

The absolute fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) was measured by a photoluminescence spectrophotometer (RF-6000,
Shimadzu Co.) with a 100 mm integrated sphere instrument. The measurement
was carried out after 275 nm light irradiation for 10 min at 298 K.
The absorptivity and internal and external fluorescence quantum yields
ΦF of the YAP:Ce at an excitation wavelength of 275
nm were 55.2%, 10.3%, and 5.7%, respectively.
