The
C4F7N (fluorinated nitrile) gas mixture
has been recognized as the most potential substitute gas to SF6 used in gas-insulated equipment. In this paper, we explored
the thermal stability and decomposition properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture.
The influence mechanism of oxygen content and temperature on the byproduct
generation was obtained and analyzed. It was found that thermal decomposition
of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture mainly produces CO, C3F6, C3F8, CF3CN, (CN)2,
and COF2. The addition of oxygen could accelerate the decomposition
of C4F7N. The content of C3F6 and (CN)2 decreases, while the yield of CF4, CO, C3F8, and COF2 increases
with the oxygen content. Thermal decomposition of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture
at temperatures lower than 425 °C results from the interaction
between C4F7N and the metal heating element,
while the bond cleavage reactions occur at higher temperature. As
for engineering application, the oxygen added in the 6%C4F7N–94%N2 gas mixture should not exceed
6% to avoid the negative effect of oxygen on the thermal stability
of C4F7N.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) has been extensively used
in high-voltage (HV) gas-insulated equipment (GIE) including gas-insulated
switchgear (GIS) and gas-insulated lines as the gas insulating medium
and switching (interrupting) medium since the early 1960s.1−4 However, SF6 shows a high global warming potential (GWP)
value (23500 times higher than that of CO2) and is listed
as one of the most greenhouse gases by Kyoto Protocol.5−8 The global SF6 mean has reached to 9.8 ppt in 2019, while
this value was only 7.4 in 2012.9 About
80% of the SF6 gas produced worldwide is used in HV GIS,
indicating that the power industry is the main consumer.10 In addition, policy makers have strengthened
their position on high GWP gases and manufacturers have reacted accordingly
in recent years.11 Therefore, searching
for potential low-GWP SF6 alternatives used in GIE has
become a hot topic.

More recently, fluorinated nitrile (C4F7N)
has been proposed as the most promising solution in HV applications.
The pure C4F7N shows a dielectric strength of
approximately twice that of SF6, a GWP of only 2090,12,13 while its liquefaction temperature at normal condition is −4.7
°C, which can only be used as an additive to CO2 and
N2 to avoid liquefaction of the gas at low ambient temperature
in engineering application.14 In addition,
the dielectric strength of the C4F7N gas mixture
with 18–20% C4F7N can be achieved similar
to that of pure SF6.15 The insulation
properties,16−19 decomposition characteristics,20−25 and material compatibility26−28 of the C4F7N gas mixture have been deeply investigated over the past 3 years,
confirming that the C4F7N–CO2 or C4F7N–N2 gas mixture
has the potential to be used in all kinds of GIE.

Furthermore,
it has been pointed out that oxygen (O2) should be added
to the C4F7N–CO2 or C4F7N–N2 gas mixture
as a second additive gas to improve the switching performance, as
well as to reduce the generation of harmful solid byproducts such
as soot (carbon particles).29 Although
the addition of O2 could achieve the above advantages for
engineering application, the influence of oxygen on the stability
of the C4F7N gas mixture must be re-estimated
considering the strong oxidation of O2. The gas insulating
medium should be chemically stable under engineering application conditions.
On one hand, the equipment has the intrinsic temperature rise of about
70 °C, resulting in the temperature of a metal conductor which
when contacted with the gas reaches to 105–120 °C under
normal operating conditions. On the other hand, the local overheating
fault generated in the equipment could cause the decomposition of
the gas insulating medium, producing several byproducts. For example,
the thermal decomposition of SF6 could produce characteristic
components such as H2S, SO2, SOF2, and SO2F2, which can be used to evaluate
the working condition of GIE.32,33 Thus, it is necessary
to investigate the thermal stability and decomposition properties
of SF6 alternative gas.

At present, the thermal stability
of the C4F7N–CO2 and C4F7N–N2 gas mixture has been explored.13,34,35 Relevant results indicate that
the C4F7N gas mixture shows great thermal stability
at temperatures
lower than 350 °C with little C3F6 produced
first. Moreover, CF4, C2F6, C3F8, COF2, CF3CN, (CN)2, and CO are the main thermal decomposition products of the
C4F7N gas mixture. However, there are few reports
on the thermal stability and decomposition properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas
mixture. In addition, the influence mechanism of oxygen on the thermal
stability properties of the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture as well as the optimum oxygen addition content
is still unclear. In this paper, we carried out long-term thermal
stability and decomposition tests for the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture with several
O2 contents under different temperature conditions. The
composition and content of the main decomposition products were detected
and analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).
The influence of oxygen and temperature on the stability of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas
mixture was revealed first. Relevant results provide important reference
for the engineering application of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Influence of Oxygen Content
on the Thermal
Decomposition of the C4F7N–N2–O2 Gas Mixture
2.1.1 Variation
Feature of CO, CF4,
C2F6, C3F6, and C3F8
Figure 1 reveals the content of CO, CF4, C2F6, C3F6, and C3F8 of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture with different oxygen ratios after local overheating
aging tests. For the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture, the thermal decomposition results in the generation
of C3F6 with the highest content, followed by
CO. The content of CF4, C2F6, and
C3F8 at the end of the test is lower than 10
μL/L. Relevant results coincide well with our previous thermal
tests for the C4F7N–CO2 gas
mixture.34 As for the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture, the
content of CO after thermal decomposition tests ranks the highest
among all products. In addition, the content of CF4 and
C3F8 also increases to a certain extent.

Figure 1 Content of
characteristic decomposition products of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture
with different oxygen ratios after local overheating decomposition
tests at 0.15 MPa, 450 °C. (a) 0% O2, (b) 2% O2, (c) 4% O2, (d) 6% O2, (e) 8% O2.

The influence of oxygen content
on the generation of C3F6 is shown in Figure 2a. We can find that
the yield of C3F6 decreases with the increase
of oxygen content. There exists
a sharp decrease when the oxygen content changes from 0 to 2%, indicating
that the addition of O2 hinders the production of C3F6. We also introduced the effective formation
rate (RRMS) defined in refs,32,33 which could
reflect the property, severity, and development trend of a potential
fault in engineering to explore the relationship between the oxygen
content and thermal decomposition properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture. The
definition formula of the RRMS is given
as follows 1   2  where Ci1 and Ci2 are
the content (peak area) of component i in the first
and second detection, respectively. Raj represents the absolute formation rate of component i in j h. Δt is
the time interval between two detection periods, which is set to 2
in this paper. The thermal decomposition test for each group lasts
12 h, thus j is set to 6.

Figure 2 Effect of oxygen content
on the generation of C3F6, CO, CF4, and C3F8 after
local overheating decomposition tests at 0.15 MPa, 450 °C. (a)
C3F6, (b) CO, (c) CF4, (d) C3F8.

The effective formation
rate of C3F6 also
decreases with the increase of oxygen content. Actually, the generation
of C3F6 originates from the reaction between
C4F7N and the metal heating element. Earlier
studies have pointed out that the interaction between the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture and aluminum or copper
could generate C3F6 when the temperature of
the metal surface reaches to 220 °C.26 The CN group has strong reaction reactivity, which could adsorb
and dissociate on the metal surface, resulting in the decomposition
of C4F7N to generate CN and C3F7 particles. Our studies on the thermal decomposition characteristic
of the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture
also reveal that the generation of C3F6 begins
at 350 °C and its yield increases with temperature lower than
450 °C.34 Relevant results can also
be verified in the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture in this paper. In addition, reactions between O2, O, and the metal heating element or C4F7N occur when oxygen is added. The oxidation process of C3F6 may also occur, causing the decrease of C3F6.

Figure 2b describes
the variation feature of CO under different oxygen content conditions.
The yield and effective formation rate of CO increase with the content
of O2. The addition of O2 provides O particle,
which could participate in the decomposition process and cause the
oxidation of C4F7N. The yield of CO for the
C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture with 8% oxygen reaches to 450 μL/L at the end
of 12 h thermal decomposition test, which is 4 times higher than that
of the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture.

According to the results given in Figure 2c, CF4 is not detected for the
gas mixture with the oxygen content lower than 4%. The sharp increase
for the yield and effective formation rate of CF4 occurs
when the oxygen content reaches to 8%, which is higher than 45 μL/L
at the end of the test. Earlier studies on the thermal decomposition
of the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture
show that the generation of CF4 occurs at temperatures around 550 °C, which could
be recognized as the occurrence of severe overheating faults in GIE.34 As for the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture, the detection of CF4 indicates that the decomposition of C4F7N is accelerated. Because of the reason that the formation of CF4 requires CF3 and F particles and the temperature
of the heating element is fixed, the high content of oxygen has a
negative effect on the thermal stability of C4F7N.

As for C3F8, its yield shows an increasing
trend with the oxygen content lower than 6% and decreases when the
oxygen content reaches to 8% (see Figure 2d). The formation of C3F8 originates from the recombination of C3F7 and
F, so the changing trend indicates that the decomposition amount of
C4F7N molecules increased with the oxygen content.
The content of C3F8 in the 6%C4F7N–86%N2–8%O2 gas mixture
is lower than that of the 6%C4F7N–88N2–6%O2 gas mixture, which may be due to the
reason that the generated C3F7 is further oxidized
to other particles such as CF3.

2.1.2 Variation
Feature of CF3CN, (CN)2, and COF2
Figure 3 gives the variation feature of CF3CN, (CN)2, and COF2 under different oxygen
conditions after local overheating decomposition tests. It can be
seen from Figure 3a
that the peak area (content) of CF3CN increases with the
oxygen content first and then decreases, which can be explained as
follows. When the O2 content in the gas mixture is lower
than 4%, CF4 is not detected during the thermal decomposition
test according to Figure 2c. The reaction between generated CF3 and the CN
group which could recombine to form CF3CN occurs. As the
yield of CN and CF3 particles increases with the oxygen
content, the yield of CF3CN increases when the oxygen content
is lower than 4%. When the oxygen content in the gas mixture reaches
to higher value (6%), the formation of CF4 occurs because
of the generation of F particles. According to the reaction enthalpy
for the recombination of CF4 and CF3CN given
in eqs 3 and 4, we can find that the formation of CF4 and CF3CN has the negative reaction enthalpies of −126.19
and −106.31 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, the generation
of CF4 is more likely to happen than that of CF3CN. Considering that the generated CF3 particles are relatively
fixed, the yield of CF3CN shows an increasing trend when
the oxygen content in the gas mixture is higher than 6%. 3   4  

Figure 3 Effect
of oxygen content on the generation of CF3CN,
(CN)2, and COF2 after local overheating decomposition
tests (0.15 MPa, 450 °C). (a) CF3CN, (b) (CN)2, (c) COF2.

According to the variation feature of (CN)2 shown in Figure 3b, the content of
(CN)2 has a sharp decrease when the oxygen is added. The
changing trend of (CN)2 with the oxygen content is similar
to that of C3F6. This is because the generation
of both C3F6 and (CN)2 comes from
the following decomposition path of C4F7N20 5  

The generation of COF2 under different oxygen conditions
is given in Figure 3c, and we can find that the yield of COF2 increases with
the oxygen content. The sharp increase occurs when the oxygen content
is higher than 2%, indicating that the formation of these byproducts
is accelerated. The possible formation paths of COF2 are
given as follows35 6   7  

Overall, the addition of oxygen has a negative effect on the thermal
stability of the C4F7N–N2 gas
mixture, which could accelerate the decomposition of C4F7N. The content of C3F6 and (CN)2 decreases, while the yield of CF4, CO, C3F8, and COF2 increases with the oxygen content.
The formation of CF4, which could be recognized as the
characteristic component for the occurrence of severe overheating
fault, starts when the oxygen content in the gas mixture is higher
than 6%. Generally, the addition of oxygen in the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture is suggested not to exceed
6% to avoid the negative effect of oxygen on the stability of C4F7N.

2.2 Influence
of Temperature on the Thermal Decomposition
of the C4F7N–N2–O2 Gas Mixture
2.2.1 Variation Feature of
CO, CF4,
C2F6, C3F6, and C3F8
In order to further evaluate the thermal
stability properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture under different temperature
conditions, we conducted thermal decomposition tests for the 6%C4F7N–88%N2–6%O2 gas mixture at 400–500 °C (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Content of characteristic decomposition products of the 6%C4F7N–88%N2–6%O2 gas
mixture at different temperatures after local overheating decomposition
tests at 0.15 MPa. (a) 400, (b) 435, (c) 450, (d) 475, (e) 500 °C.

As we can see from Figure 4, the content of CO is the highest among
all byproducts at
400–475 °C, followed by C3F6 and
C3F8. The yield of CF4 and C2F6 is quite lower than that of the other products. Figure 5a demonstrates the
content of C3F6 at different temperature conditions.
We can find that the yield and effective formation rate of C3F6 increase with temperature in the range of 400–475
°C. Then, there was a sharp decrease when the temperature reaches
to 500 °C. The relevant changing trend indicates that the decomposition
of 6%C4F7N–88%N2–6%O2 occurs at temperatures around 400 °C. The sharp decrease
indicates that the decomposition mechanism of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture has
changed. The high temperature could directly result in the decomposition
of C4F7N to produce CF3 and other
small particles.

MPa).
(a) C3F6, (b) CO, (c) CF4, (d) C3F8.

The effect of temperature
on the yield of CO, CF4, and
C3F8 shown in Figure 5b–d indicates that higher temperature
could promote the decomposition of the 6%C4F7N–88%N2–6%O2 gas mixture. In
detail, the yield of CO and C3F8 increased dramatically
at temperatures higher than 450 °C. In addition, the formation
of CF4 is accelerated at temperatures higher than 450 °C.
The contents of CO, CF4, and C3F8 after thermal decomposition tests at 400 °C are 111, 4.25,
and 35.21 μL/L, respectively, which increased to 522.75, 21.27,
and 105.32 μL/L at 500 °C. In addition, the effective formation
rate of CO, CF4, and C3F8 also has
a positive relationship with fault temperature.

2.2.2 Variation Feature of CF3CN, (CN)2, and
COF2
Figure 6 gives the variation
feature of CF3CN, (CN)2, and COF2 in the 6%C4F7N–88%N2–6%O2 gas mixture after local overheating decomposition tests.
The content of CF3CN presents an increasing trend with
temperature at 400–475 °C (see Figure 6a). In detail, the peak area of CF3CN increases slowly at temperatures lower than 450 °C, and a
sharp increasing trend occurs when the fault temperature reaches to
higher than 475 °C. In addition, the yield and formation rate
of CF3CN slow down at 500 °C. According to the variation
feature of (CN)2 shown in Figure 8b, the peak area and effective formation
rate of (CN)2 have a similar changing trend to that of
C3F6. The yield of (CN)2 has a positive
relationship with temperature in the range of 400–475 °C
and reaches the summit value at 475 °C. The content of (CN)2 presents a decreasing trend at temperatures higher than 475
°C, indicating that the generation of the CN particle slows down.
Thus, the formation amount and rate of CF3CN also decreased
at temperatures higher than 475 °C.

Figure 6 Effect of temperature
on the generation of CF3CN, (CN)2, and COF2 in the 6%C4F7N–88%N2–6%O2 gas mixture after local overheating
decomposition tests (0.15 MPa). (a) CF3CN, (b) (CN)2, (c) COF2.

The peak area and formation rate of COF2 also show an
increasing trend with temperature. The growth rate is comparatively
slow below 425 °C and then increases dramatically at 425–500
°C. Considering that the formation of COF2 needs the
participation of CF3, CF2, and O particles,
we can conclude that the generation of these particles is accelerated
at temperatures higher than 425 °C.

2.2.3 Discussion
The above results show
that the fault temperature has a slight influence on the thermal stability
and decomposition characteristics of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture. The thermal
decomposition mechanism at different temperatures results in some
differences.

The thermal decomposition of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture starts
at temperature around 400 °C. At this stage, C3F6 and CO are the main decomposition byproducts. Their concentration
after 12 h aging test is 21.62 and 111 μL/L, respectively. The
content of other byproducts such as CF4 and C3F8 is lower than 5.5 μL/L. In addition, the peak
area of CF3CN, (CN)2, and COF2 at
400 °C also has the lowest value. The thermal decomposition of
the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture at 400 °C is mainly attributed to the reaction
between C4F7N and the metal heating element.
The fault source may not provide enough energy to result in the direct
decomposition of the C4F7N molecule. The CN
group in C4F7N could adsorb on the metal surface,
and then the dissociation of C4F7N occurs, generating
C3F7 and CN.

With the increase of fault
temperature, the amount and formation
rate of all kinds of products show a positive relationship with temperature
at 425–475 °C. C3F6, C3F8, and CO are the main thermal decomposition products
at this stage, whose content went up to 556, 143, and 133 μL/L
at 475 °C, respectively. The yield of CF4 reaches
to 19.81 μL/L at 475 °C. In addition, the peak area of
CF3CN, (CN)2, and COF2 also increases
with temperature at this stage. The yields of CF3CN and
(CN)2 are in their peak value at 475 °C. The decomposition
of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture at this stage results from the interaction between
C4F7N and the metal heating element partly.
The produced C3F7 and CN could recombine to
form amounts of C3F6, C3F8, and (CN)2. In addition, the direct decomposition of
C4F7N occurs at temperatures higher than 425
°C considering the quick increase of CF4, CF3CN, and C3F8. Small particles such as CF3, F, and CF2 start to generate at this stage. Actually,
the decomposition paths and reaction enthalpy of C4F7N have been calculated based on the density functional theory
by Fu et al. and Zhang et al.20,21 They both pointed out
that the bond cleavage reaction of C4F7N generating
C3F4N and CF3 has the lowest reaction
enthalpy among all possible paths, which is most likely to occur.
Kieffel et al. also tested the thermal decomposition properties of
the C4F7N–CO2 gas mixture
using the tube furnace and found that the decomposition of the gas
mixture occurs at temperature higher than 650 °C. In addition,
C3F6 was not detected.13 Thus, we conclude that the thermal decomposition mechanism of the
C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture at lower temperature (<425 °C) is due to the
reaction between C4F7N and metal the heating
element, and the bond cleavage process occurs at temperatures higher
than 425 °C.

When the temperature reaches higher than 475
°C, the yield
of C3F6, CF3CN, and (CN)2 slows down and the content of CO, CF4, and C3F8 is still increasing. The bond cleavage process becomes
the dominant decomposition reactions at this stage.

As for engineering
application, considering that the temperature
of the metal conductor is at 105–120 °C, the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture
has great thermal stability at this temperature range. Thus, oxygen
has few impacts on the thermal stability properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture
under normal application conditions. In addition, it is necessary
to monitor the temperature of GIE to avoid the appearance of overheating
faults, which could cause the decomposition of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture. The
existence of C3F6 indicates that thermal faults
at early stage occur, and the detection of CF4 indicates
that severe faults occur in GIE.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, we investigated the thermal stability and decomposition
properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture used as the alternative gas for
SF6 in HV GIE. The components of the gas mixture under
different test conditions were detected using GC–MS. The variation
feature and influence mechanism of the oxygen content and temperature
on the thermal decomposition characteristics of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture were
obtained and analyzed. The following conclusions can be obtained:(1) The decomposition
of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture
mainly produces CO, C3F6, C3F8, CF4, CF3CN, (CN)2, and
COF2. The addition of oxygen has a negative effect on the
thermal stability of the C4F7N–N2 gas mixture, which could accelerate the decomposition of
C4F7N. The content of C3F6, (CN)2 decreases, while the yield of CF4,
CO, C3F8, and COF2 increases with
the oxygen content.

(2) Thermal decomposition of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas
mixture at temperatures lower than 425 °C results from the interaction
between C4F7N and the metal heating element.
The bond cleavage process of C4F7N occurs at
temperatures higher 425 °C, generating CF3, F, and
other particles. In addition, the thermal decomposition of the gas
mixture at higher temperature (>475 °C) is mainly attributed
to the bond cleavage reactions.

(3) As for engineering application, the
recommended oxygen added in the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture should not exceed 6% to
avoid the negative effect on the gas mixture. The existence of C3F6 indicates that thermal faults at early stage
occur and the detection of CF4 indicates that severe faults
happen in GIE.



4 Methods
4.1 Test Platform
Figure 7 shows the schematic diagram of the local
overheating decomposition test platform, which mainly consists of
the gas chamber, the heating system, and the temperature control system.
The stainless-steel gas chamber could withstand the high pressure
of 0.7 MPa. The K-type heating element is set in the center of the
gas chamber to simulate the overheating faults in GIE.32,33 The temperature control system includes the electric relay, the
PID control device, and temperature sensor. The temperature sensor
embedded in the heating element tests the actual temperature and sends
the signal to the PID control device. Then, the PID control device
compares the actual temperature with the set temperature and sends
switching signal to the electric relay. The no-deviating regulation
of the operating temperature and target temperature can be achieved
by this system.

test platform.

The gas samples were analyzed
by GC–MS (Shimadzu QP2010).
The CP-Sil5CB (60 m × 0.32 mm) capillary column was chosen to
separate the characteristic decomposition products. The heating procedure
of the column is given as follows: (1) the column should be kept at
32 °C for 7 min. (2) The column should be heated to 150 °C
with the rate of 60 °C/min. (3) The column should be kept at
150 °C for 2 min. We used single ion monitoring method to detect
the possible decomposition products, and Table 1 gives the mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of characteristic decomposition products
of the C4F7N gas mixture.

Table 1 Mass-to-Charge Ratios of Characteristic
Decomposition Products of the C4F7N Gas Mixture

In order to confirm the separation performance,
we conducted the
thermal aging test for the 6%C4F7N–90%CO2–4%O2 gas mixture for 12 h. Figure 8 gives the gas chromatogram obtained using the above method.
We can find that the characteristic peak of CO, COF2, C3F8, CF3CN, C3F6, and (CN)2 appears, indicating that the chosen capillary
column is applicable.

decomposition test (at 0.15 MPa, 450 °C). (a) total chromatogram;
(b) high-resolution chromatogram.

As for quantitative analysis of the characteristic decomposition
products, we established an external standard method for CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C3F6, and CO. In addition, the peak area integral method
was used for relative quantitative analysis for COF2, CF3CN, C3F6, and (CN)2 because
of the reason that the standard gas for these byproducts is not accessible
at present. GC–MS has the detection limit of 0.1 μL/L,
which guarantees the accuracy of the detection results.

4.2 Test Method
In order to explore the
thermal decomposition properties of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture, we carried
out aging tests for each group of gas mixture for 12 h. The content
of C4F7N in the gas mixture is set to 6% considering
that the content of C4F7N in the gas mixture
should be less than 6% at 0.6 MPa for the minimum operating temperature
of −25 °C in engineering application.34 We totally conducted nine groups of tests to explore the
influence of temperature and oxygen content on the thermal decomposition
characteristics of the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture, as shown in Table 2. The content of C4F7N is fixed to 6% for all groups. In addition, the content of oxygen
is set to 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8%. For the 6%C4F7N–84%N2–8%O2 gas mixture, the
content of O2 is higher than that of C4F7N. Considering the strong oxidized characteristic of O2, we think that using 8% as the upper limit of oxygen is enough.

The gas chamber was cleaned with
anhydrous alcohol to remove the
impurities first. Then, pure CO2 was injected into the
chamber to 0.3 MPa and pumped to 0 MPa. This procedure was repeated
three times to ensure that there is no impurity gas in the chamber.
Finally, the C4F7N–N2–O2 gas mixture with different O2 contents was filled.
The C4F7N (purity of 99.2%) used in this paper
was provided by 3M company. In addition, the He (purity of 99.999%)
and N2 (purity of 99.999%) were supplied by Wuhan Newred
Special Gas Co., Ltd.
