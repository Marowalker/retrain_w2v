Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have
shown broad application prospects
in the field of photovoltaic devices due to their unique quantum confinement
and edge effects. Here, we prepared GQDs by a photon-Fenton reaction
as reported in our previous work, which has great advantage in the
preparation scale. The photoelectric properties of the inverted hybrid
solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):(6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methylester (PCBM):GQDs and P3HT:GQDs with
different contents of GQDs as the active layers are demonstrated,
as well as their morphology and structure by atomic force microscopy
images. Then, the different roles of GQDs played in the ternary (P3HT:PCBM:GQDs)
and binary (P3HT:GQDs) hybrid solar cells are studied systematically.
The results indicate that the GQDs provide an efficient excition separation
interface and charge transport channel for the improvement of hybrid
solar cells. The preliminary exploration and elaboration of the role
of GQDs in hybrid solar cells will be beneficial to understand the
interfacial procedure and improve device performance in the future.

Introduction
Graphene quantum dots
(GQDs) have attracted a great deal of attention
in photovoltaic applications due to a series of excellent properties
such as high carrier transport mobility, large surface area, tunable
band gaps, quantum confinement, and environmentally friendly nature.1−8 Unremitting efforts have been made in the preparation of GQDs and
their application as the electron-acceptor materials in the active
layer of organic solar cells.9−13 However, hybrid solar cells that completely replaced the original
electron-acceptor materials with GQDs in the heterojunction active
layer did not perform well. Worse, the performances of these hybrid
solar cells are even much lower than those of the devices assembled
with the original electron-acceptor material.11,13 For example, Li et al. used GQDs prepared by the electrochemical
approach in the aqueous phase system to completely replace the fullerence
derivative (6,6)-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methylester (PCBM),
which is the representative electron-acceptor material, and obtained
a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.28%.11 Gupta et al. prepared GQDs functionalized with aniline (ANI), and
the as-fabricated hybrid solar cells based on poly(3-hexylthiophene)
(P3HT):ANI-GQDs presented a PCE of 1.14%.13 Accordingly, the real role of GQDs in hybrid solar cells still needs
to be studied thoroughly and systematically.

Ternary blend organic
solar cells, which have the advantage of
well absorbtion and utilization of solar irradiation using the three
materials of donors/acceptor with complementary absorptions, have
attracted great attention for improving the device performance. Besides,
the simple fabrication process of the single-junction device and the
potential synergistic interaction among three active materials make
it more competitive.14−18 Recently, ternary hybrid solar cells using GQDs as the second electron
acceptor material were also fabricated by the community to obtain
better performance. For example, Wang et al. achieved a 15% improvement
of the PCE by introducing GQDs into the active layer (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM) of solar cells.19 Dang et al. have fabricated ternary hybrid solar
cells based on the active layer of PCDTBT:PC71BM:GQDs and
achieved a 21% enhancement of the PCE compared to the device based
on the active layer without GQDs.20 Although
the device performance of ternary hybrid solar cells can be significantly
improved by employing GQDs as the second electron acceptors, the different
effect of GQDs in the film morphology of the active layer between
binary and ternary solar cells has not been compared and investigated
comprehensively. It was well-known that the film morphology of the
active layer would be strongly influenced by the number, type, and
ratio of the electron-donor/acceptor materials. Thus, the film morphology
of binary and ternary hybrid solar cells would be critically different
and afford tremendous difference in device performance. These differences
between the binary and ternary hybrid solar cells have been studied
in many research studies;21−23 however, to the best of our knowledge,
only few studies have focused simultaneously on the difference between
binary and ternary hybrid solar cells using GQDs as an electron acceptor.

Herein, binary (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:GQDs/MoO3/Ag) and ternary
(ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM:GQDs/MoO3/Ag) hybrid solar cells were
fabricated to study the photovoltaic properties of the GQDs prepared
via a photon-Fenton reaction as reported in our previous work.24 The performances and the film morphology of
their active layers were compared systematically. The different influence
of GQDs on the performances of binary and ternary hybrid solar cells
has been studied comprehensively.

Experimental Section
Preparation
of the GQDs
The GQDs were prepared by a
photon-Fenton reaction using the graphene oxide (GO) as the raw material;
the method is described in detail in our previous work.24 After the concentrated product of GQDs aqueous
suspension was purified with the dialysis bag (retained the molecular
weight: 1000 Da), the GQDs powder was obtained from the GQDs aqueous
suspension using a freeze dryer, which utilizes the sublimation of
the water directly under vacuum to maximize the preservation of the
inherent properties and structure of the material.

Preparation
of Zinc Oxide (ZnO) Precursor Solution
Zinc acetate (0.5
mmol) and monoethanolamine (0.5 mmol) were dissolved
in 2-methoxy ethanol (10 mL) and stirred by a magnetic stirrer at
60 °C for 2 h, then a homogeneous and transparent sol was gained.25 The different concentration (0.5, 1 M) precursor
solution were prepared by keeping the molar ratio of monoethanolamine
and zinc acetate at 1:1 (Figure S1). To
improve the viscosity of the precursor solution, it was aged at room
temperature for 12 h before spin-coating.

Fabrication of Organic
Solar Cells
The solar cells
were fabricated according to the inverted structure, and their typical
structure is (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag), in which the
active layer could be (P3HT), (P3HT:PCBM), (P3HT:GQDs), or (P3HT:PCBM:GQDs).
The indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned with
detergent, ultrapure water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic
bath for 30 min. Then, the ITO glass substrates were dried by a high-pressure
nitrogen gun and pretreated at 100 °C for 8 h in an oven. Then,
the ZnO precursor solution was deposited on the ITO glass substrates
by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, which were immediately annealed
at 300 °C for 10 min and 350 °C for 20 min in an oven to
form ZnO film.25 For comparison, four kinds
of dichlorobenzene (DCB) solutions were prepared and stirred at 30
°C for 10 h: DCB of P3HT (20 mg mL–1); P3HT
(20 mg mL–1)/GQDs (the content is 0.25, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, and 4.0 wt % relative to the mass of P3HT); P3HT (20 mg mL–1)/PCBM (16 mg mL–1); and P3HT (20
mg mL–1)/PCBM (16 mg mL–1)/GQDs
(the content is 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 wt % relative to the
mass of P3HT:PCBM blend). The active layers were fabricated by spin-coating
the DCB solutions on the ZnO films at 800 rpm for 40 s. The active
layers were then put into a covered Petri dish and dried slowly for
30 min in air. Next, MoO3 (6 nm) and Ag (110 nm) layers
were thermally evaporated onto the active layers at a rate of 0.01
and 0.5 nm s–1, respectively, under about 3 ×
10–6 Torr. The effective area of the cells is 0.06
cm2, which is defined by the active layer and Ag electrode.
All devices were annealed at 150 °C for 10 min after evaporation
in a vacuum furnace.26,27

Characterization and Measurements
Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) images were taken using a Multimode Nanoscope V scanning probe
microscopy system (Bruker) in the tapping mode; the AFM cantilever
tips were AN-NSC10 (ShnitCo., Russia) with a force constant of ∼37
N m–1. The aqueous suspension of GQDs was spin-coated
on a freshly cleaved mica surface and dried in air overnight for AFM
measurement. The UV–vis absorption and the photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of the GQDs were measured with Shimadzu UV-2550 (Shimadzu,
Japan) and a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian). The Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with an EQUINOX 55
FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). The samples for FTIR measurement
were prepared by grinding the mixture of the dried GQDs and KBr powders
and then compressing them into thin pellets. The current density–voltage
(J–V) characteristics of
the solar cells were measured in air using a Keithley 2401 source
measurement unit under air mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G) irradiation with
a solar simulator. Light intensity used in this study was 100 mW cm–2.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the
as-prepared GQDs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement
with a CHI 660C electrochemical workstation (Chen Hua Co., China)
using a standard three-electrode system, which consists of a stick
of platinum wire as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl electrode as
the reference electrode, and a glassy carbon electrode coated with
GQDs by drop-casting as the working electrode. Tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M, Aldrich) in acetonitrile
was used as an electrolyte for the CV measurement. The electrolyte
solution was purged with high-purity argon gas for 20 min to remove
oxygen before each measurement.

Results and Discussion
The GQDs were prepared from GO via a photo-Fenton reaction as reported
in our previous work.24 The AFM image of
the as-prepared GQDs is shown in Figure 1a, with a height profile of GQDs along the
line. The topographic heights have an average thickness of ∼0.8
nm, assuming a single atomic layer motif. The UV–vis absorption
spectrum of GQDs shows a typical absorption band at 230 nm (Figure 1b), which is assigned
to the π → π* transition of the aromatic sp2 domains. As shown in Figure 1c, the GQDs emitted a yellow-green fluorescence under
UV light (302 nm). With the increase of the excitation wavelength
beyond 340 nm, the emission wavelength of GQDs had a red shift caused
by the wide size distribution of the GQDs. The emission spectra of
the as-prepared GQDs show an excitation-dependent feature that is
similar to those of GQDs prepared by the hydrothermal method.28 Also, with the excitation wavelength of 340
nm, the PL emission has the highest intensity at around 450 nm, which
is attributed to the conjugated carbon backbone of the GQDs.29 As shown in the FTIR spectrum (Figure 1d), several significant FTIR
peaks corresponding to oxygen functional groups are observed, such
as the C=O stretching vibration peak at 1726 cm–1, the C–O (epoxy) stretching vibration peak at 1247 cm–1, the C–O (alkoxy) stretching peak at 1060
cm–1, and vibration and deformation peaks of O–H
groups at 3429 and 1385 cm–1, respectively.

As shown in Figure 2a, the inverted bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on
ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were chosen to demonstrate
the photoelectric application potential of GQDs in the active layer.
The active layers of binary and ternary hybrid solar cells are P3HT:GQDs
and P3HT:PCBM:GQDs blend films, respectively.

of the binary and ternary hybrid solar
cells with P3HT:GQDs and P3HT:PCBM:GQDs as active layers, with the
chemical structure of P3HT, GQDs, and PCBM. J–V characteristics of (b) binary and (c) ternary hybrid solar
cells with different contents of GQDs under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm–2 illumination.

The J–V curves of the
binary hybrid solar cells with different contents of GQDs are shown
in Figure 2b. The short-circuit
current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage
(Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of the as-fabricated binary hybrid solar cells based
on P3HT:GQDs active layers are summarized in Table 1. Typically, the solar cell based on P3HT:GQDs
active layer with 1.0% GQDs showed a PCE of 0.25%, Voc of 0.56 V, Jsc of 1.22
mA cm–2, and FF of 36.89%. The PCE of the cells
improve first and then drop when the weight ratio of GQDs/P3HT surpassed
1%. The maximum value of PCE is achieved in the cell in which 1% GQD
was blended with P3HT. The Jsc increased
first and then decreased with the increase of content of GQDs. The
maximum value of Jsc was obtained from
the cell that with 1% GQDs. Besides, the Voc of the hybrid solar cells is also strongly dependent on the content
of GQDs. The trend of Voc and content
of GQDs is similar to that of Jsc and
PCE. Because the Voc of the organic solar
cells is proportional to the offset between the HOMO of the donor
and the LUMO of the acceptor, it increases from 0.45 to 0.56 V gradually
with the increase in acceptor (GQDs) content from 0.25 to 1% for the
binary hybrid solar cells. The decrease of the Voc from 0.56 to 0.45 V with the increase in content of GQDs
from 2.0 to 4.0% is attributed to the addition of excess GQDs, which
would result in much agglomeration and prevent donor (P3HT) and acceptor
(GQDs) from mixing evenly. Besides, we also note that some similar
change cases are displayed from the reported literature.13 However, there is no significant change in the
FF with the variation of content of GQDs. In the binary solar cell,
the GQDs act as electron acceptors. Therefore, with the increase in
content of GQDs from 0.25 to 1%, the Jsc and FF were improved due to the enhanced concentration of the excition
dissociation centers in the active layer, which lead to the increase
in PCE. However, with the ratio of GQDs surpassing 1%, the leakage
current was increased because the agglomerated GQDs behaved as potential
recombination sites, which induced to the drop of PCE.

To improve the performance of organic solar cells
further, we have
blended P3HT:PCBM:GQDs as the active layer to make ternary hybrid
solar cells. The J–V curves
of the as-assembled ternary hybrid with different contents GQDs are
shown in Figure 2c,
and the performance details of the solar cells were shown in Table 2. A PCE of 4.13% with
a Voc of 0.60 V, Jsc of 12.31 mA cm–2, and FF of 55.77% is
obtained from the hybrid solar cell based on P3HT:PCBM:GQDs active
layer with 1.0% GQDs. Comparatively, the solar cell based on P3HT:PCBM
active layer without GQDs displayed a PCE of 2.96%, Voc of 0.59 V, Jsc of 9.51
mA cm–2, and FF of 52.50%, which is consistent with
PCE of the reported P3HT:PCBM-based inverted solar cells.25,30−34 Similar to the aforementioned binary hybrid solar cells, the PCE
and Jsc increased first and then decreased
with the increase of content of GQDs. The maximum value of PCE was
obtained from the cell with 1% content of GQDs. It was displayed that
the Voc and FF of ternary hybrid solar
cells changed slightly. The slight decrease of the open circuit voltage
from 0.60 to 0.57 V with the content of GQDs increase from 1.0 to
4.0% is attributed to the addition of excess GQDs, which was consistent
with the reported literatures.30,31,35−37 The Jsc enhanced gradually
with the increase of content of GQDs from 0.25 to 1% and then dropped
rapidly with the content of GQDs rise to 4%. Thus, the variations
of PCE in ternary hybrid solar cells are mainly attributed to the
changes of their Jsc. The enhancement
of PCE can be mainly attributed to the plenty excition dissociation
interfaces and the improving charge transport pathway. However, the
addition of excess GQDs may result in many agglomeration, which would
prevent P3HT and PCBM from mixing evenly, thus greatly reducing the
separation efficiency of excitons and the transport of charge.

It is worth noting that for the ternary hybrid solar
cells (P3HT:PCBM:GQDs),
the maximum increment of Jsc is 2.8 mA
cm–2 from the control group (P3HT:PCBM) of 9.51
mA cm–2 to the maximum value of 12.31 mA cm–2. However, for the binary hybrid solar cells (P3HT:GQDs),
the maximum increment of Jsc is only 1.214
mA cm–2 from the control group (P3HT) of 0.006 mA
cm–2 to maximum value of 1.22 mA cm–2. The obtained Jsc of the hybrid solar
cells based on the P3HT:PCBM:GQD active layer is almost 30% higher
than that based on the P3HT:PCBM active layer and 10 times higher
than that based on the P3HT:GQD active layer. Similarly, the obtained
PCE of the hybrid solar cells based on the P3HT:PCBM:GQD active layer
is almost 41% higher than that based on the P3HT:PCBM active layer
and 17 times higher than that based on the P3HT:GQDs active layer.
After the addition of PCBM and GQDs, both the current density and
efficiency of the solar cell have been significantly improved, which
suggests the synergistic interaction between GQDs and PCBM. Besides,
the opening circuit voltage and the filling factor of the hybrid solar
cells based on the P3HT:PCBM:GQD active layer are just slightly higher
than those of the P3HT:PCBM-based solar cell, which indicates that
the efficiency of the P3HT:PCBM:GQD-based hybrid solar cell can be
further improved by process optimization. The increments suggest that
the roles of GQDs in ternary hybrid solar cells were more than that
of a sole electron acceptor as in binary solar cells. As PCBM has
a fullerene structure as shown in Figure 1a, the GQDs would be absorbed on the surface
of PCBM by the van der Waals forces or π–π interactions
between them, as they both have a benzene ring structure, which would
construct more efficient exciton dissociation interfaces and be beneficial
to the charge transport.31,38

Since the photocurrent
is mostly related to the photoinduced charge
carrier generation and transport, the morphology of active layer is
a critical factor for performance of solar cells. To characterize
the morphological variation depending on the content of GQDs, AFM
was used to measure the morphology and structure of active layer. Figure 3a–f show the
AFM phase images of P3HT film and the P3HT:GQDs active layers prepared
by spin-coating the DCB solution of P3HT with different contents of
GQDs. The fibrous phase and the yellow dot phase in images most probably
are P3HT and GQDs.29,39,40 With the increase of content of GQDs, the yellow dot phase become
more and more obviously. When the content of GQDs reached 1%, almost
every fiber was covered by yellow dots except sporadic aggregates
of GQDs, as shown in Figure 3d. However, with the increase of content of GQDs, the aggregates
of GQDs dominate the active layer, as shown in Figure 3e,f, which means excessive GQDs addition
might cause agglomerates that are unfavorable for the separation and
transmission photon-generated carriers. High quality hybrid blend
film obtained from suitable content of GQDs, which can promote to
reduce series resistance effectively, is quite important for the device
performance. The morphology of the interpenetrating donor–acceptor
networks has been well constructed with the optimizing of content
of GQDs accompanying with nanoscale phase separation, which results
in a large interfacial area for efficient charge generation. Therefore,
the maximum value of PCE was obtained from the binary cell with 1%
content of GQDs.

Figure 3 AFM phase images of the P3HT:GQDs active layers with different
contents of GQDs: (a) 0%, (b) 0.25%, (c) 0.5%, (d) 1%, (e) 2%, and
(f) 4%.

Similarly, the film morphologies
of active layers based on P3HT:PCBM
and P3HT:PCBM:GQDs with different contents of GQDs were compared by
the AFM phase images as shown in Figure 4. The image of the P3HT:PCBM film as shown
in Figure 4a reveals
that a relatively homogeneous phase of P3HT and PCBM has been obtained
and interwoven network structure of P3HT fibers could be observed.
With the increase of content of GQDs from 0 to 1% (Figure 4a–d), the interwoven
network structure becomes more and more obvious. Homogeneous film
morphology of P3HT, PCBM, and GQDs with well-interwoven network structure
and an obvious microphase separation has been obtained when the content
of GQDs reached 1% (Figure 4d). However, with the further increase of content of GQDs
from 1 to 4% (Figure 4d–f), the network structure of films decreases and the uniformity
of morphology becomes worse. Even some agglomerates could be observed
from the AFM image, as shown in Figure 4f, which means that addition of excess GQDs is also
unfavorable for the nanoscale phase separation of the active layer
film of the ternary hybrid solar cell. The uniform morphology results
in the enhancement of the exciton migration to the donor–acceptor
interface, leading to a decrease in the resistance and a corresponding
increase in the performance of the solar cells.27,41,42 Thus, the maximum value of PCE was obtained
from the cell with 1% GQDs.

Figure 4 AFM phase images of P3HT:PCBM:GQDs film active
layers with different
contents of GQDs: (a) 0%, (b) 0.25%, (c) 0.5%, (d) 1%, (e) 2%, and
(f) 4%.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels
of the as-synthesized GQDs were
calculated according to the reported equations13 as follows 1   2  where Eox is the
onset of the oxidation potential and Ered is the onset of the reduction potential. The electron energy levels
of GQDs were studied by cyclic voltammetry as shown in Figure S2. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of
the GQDs were calculated to be −3.5 and −5.5 eV, respectively.
As shown in Figure 5a,b, the electron energy level of the GQDs matches well with the
electron energy level of the ZnO, PCBM, P3HT, and MoO3.
The unique band structure of as-prepared GQDs in our work narrows
the energy barrier between the HOMO and LUMO between P3HT and PCBM,
which affords the dissociation of excitons, as displayed in Figure 5b. The processes
of exciton dissociation and the as-separated electrons transport are
promoted synergistically with the introduction of the suitable amount
of GQDs. In addition, the existence of GQDs also contributes to the
enhancement of the absorption of P3HT:PCBM in previous literatures.12 All these beneficial factors afford the improved
performance of ZnO/P3HT:PCBM:GQDs/MoO3 hybrid solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, GQDs prepared via a photo-Fenton reaction were introduced
to the active layer to fabricate the binary (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:GQDs/MoO3/Ag) and ternary (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM:GQDs/MoO3/Ag)
hybrid solar cells. A maximum PCE value of 0.25% was obtained for
a binary hybrid solar cell, while that of 4.13% was obtained for a
ternary hybrid solar cell. The photoelectric properties and intrinsic
roles of the GQDs were studied systematically and highlighted by comparing
the performances of hybrid devices and film morphologies of the corresponding
active layers. The maximum PCE value of ternary hybrid solar cell
(P3HT:PCBM:GQDs) was improved by 40% compared with that of the control
group (P3HT:PCBM), which was contributed by the enhancement of exciton
separation and charge transport processes with the help of GQDs as
an electron acceptor and charge transport channel. The synergistic
interaction between GQDs and PCBM helps donor/acceptor to mix evenly
and obtain a uniform film morphology of the active layer. The preliminary
exploration and elaboration of the role of GQDs in hybrid solar cells
will be beneficial to understand the interfacial procedure and improve
the device performance in the future.
