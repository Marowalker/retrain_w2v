A wide
set of 65 diverse Ru metathesis catalysts was investigated
in the ethenolysis reaction of biosourced ethyl oleate to allow the
comparison between the catalyst structure and its activity and selectivity.
Handling of the oleic substrate, weighing of the catalysts, and charging
the reactor were done in air, with exclusion of a glovebox or Schlenk
techniques. A catalyst bearing the unsymmetrical N-heterocyclic ligand
featuring a thiophene fragment (Ru-63) was selected to
offer the best combination between high selectivity and sufficient
activity under conditions mimicking oil industry practice. A proof-of-concept
large-scale ethenolysis experiment was also done with the selected
catalyst to prove its high selectivity at the 1 L scale reaction with
a 90% pure non-distilled substrate.

Introduction
The
olefin cross-metathesis (CM) transformation of seed and algae
oils has significant potential as a sustainable way to obtain a number
of valuable products.1 Although the existing
technology already in use in a plant located in Gresik, Indonesia,
and planned for a new facility in Lahad Datu, Malaysia, is based on
the CM of a palm oil with 1-butene (butenolysis),2 the alternative process of ethenolysis is seen to be preferred
industrially as it produces a less complicated product mixture, containing
a higher amount of valuable 9-decenoic acid 9-DA (1, Scheme 1).3 Therefore, ethenolysis of methyl oleate (2a)—the widely used model of natural fatty acid glycerol esters—became
a widely studied transformation in the recent years.4 Many research groups tried to develop the optimal reaction
conditions and find the best catalyst for this process. Initially,
ethenolysis of fatty oils was carried out with in situ formed catalytic
systems, for example, WCl6/SnMe4.5 The more recent studies are however concentrating
on well-defined Mo, W, or Ru catalysts.6 Because of their higher air and moisture stability, ruthenium complexes
seem to be the best choice for the industrially effective ethenolysis
of fatty esters.7

Scheme 1 Butenolysis vs Ethenolysis
of Methyl Oleate (2a)
Unfortunately, as compared with butenolysis, in the ethenolysis
of 2a, much lower turnover numbers (TONs) of only 2000–5000
were achieved with the standard Ru metathesis catalysts, although
purified substrates and anaerobic conditions have been used.8 The reaction selectivity is also an issue, and
although the first-generation Grubbs catalyst ((PCy3)2(Cl)2RuCHPh) shows high selectivity for ethenolysis
(though it is very short-living under the reaction conditions), the
second-generation catalysts are significantly less selective because
of their propensity for self-metathesis reactions. The reason why
ethenolysis is so problematic lays in general low stability of propagating
methylidene ([Ru] = CH2) species, a feature that makes
most of the standard first- and second-generation Ru metathesis catalysts
decompose very quickly in the presence of ethylene.9 Until now, the most promising results have been accomplished
with Ru catalysts bearing so-called cyclic (amino)(alkyl)carbene (CAAC)
ligands.10 Grubbs showed that with these
catalysts, an impressive 180 000 TON can be achieved if ethylene
of 99.95% purity is used and the reaction is conducted in a glovebox.11 The use of an expensive ultrahigh grade ethylene
(99.995%) led to even higher 340 000 TON.11 In 2013, Shi et al. showed that CAAC catalysts can work
even outside a glovebox (26000 TON); however, 2a of 99% purity and vacuum-dried vessels (like in a Schlenk
technique) were used.12 Recently, Skowerski
reported up to 94 000 TON with a tailored CAAC catalyst, indicating
that oleic acid used for the preparation of 2a was crystallized
several times to remove other fatty acids, and ethylene of 99.99%
purity was used.13 The above results (26 000–340 000
TON) are impressive and leave practically no room for further competition.
However, after talks with technologists from a number of oil companies,
we decided to focus more on the practicability issues, in order to
consolidate the potential of modern metathesis catalysts in biomass
conversion under practical oil industry conditions (vide infra, Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Ethenolysis of Ethyl
Oleate (2b) Constraints
Results and Discussion
Herein, we report our efforts
to find an optimal catalyst structure
and conditions for a practical ethenolysis of oleic ester (2b, Scheme 2). Our industrial
partner in this study, Skotan S.A., imposed strict guidelines to make
the ethenolysis process viable under conditions typically reachable
in the oil industry, such as (i) complete banishment of a glovebox
or Schlenk techniques as the above-mentioned techniques are impractical
in industrial context, (ii) reaction setup, catalyst handling, and
the reactor loading must be done possibly in air, with only an exceptional
use of a protective atmosphere, (iii) use of ethylene grade 3.0 (99.9%)
but not higher, and (iv) the oleic ester substrate should be of practical
purity (90–95%) rather than of high (“research”)
purity. Because of patent limitations, we were in addition asked to
focus on non-CAAC catalysts. Such strict conditions made this task
quite challenging; however, we hoped that perhaps by choice of the
right Ru catalyst we can make it possible. On the basis of the results
of Grubbs et al. on applications of Ru benzylidene complexes bearing
unsymmetrical N-heterocyclic ligands (uNHCs)14 in ethenolysis of 2a, where relatively high TON of
5070 and excellent selectivity were achieved,6c we decided to screen a number of NHC and uNHC-bearing systems known
in the literature, which were prepared in our laboratories. The Grubbs’
crucial observation that the uNHC complexes exhibit longer lifetimes
in metathesis reactions, presumably as a result of the better stability
of their methylidenes,6c was in line with
our results on the application of some uNHC-bearing catalysts that
exhibited outstanding selectivity in challenging self-CM and in a
high-concentration macrocyclization via RCM (Ring-Closing Metathesis).15 Of note, the high selectivity of the ethenolysis step was
the key factor requested by our industrial partner to make the whole
process cost-efficient. This selectivity is defined as the proportion
between the expected products (1b and 3)
and the self-CM (sometimes referred to as “homodimerization”)
products 4b and 5 (Scheme 2).a As the planned
ethenolysis process will not be run at full conversion, some amounts
of isomerized (E/Z)-2b will be present in the reaction mixture as well (Scheme 2) and perhaps recycled (this
was, however, not a goal of the present study).

On the basis
of the previous results described in the patent and
scientific literature3−6 and some preliminary in-house tests, we defined the starting condition
to perform ethenolysis [catalyst loading 500 ppm; ethylene pressure
10 bar; temperature 50 °C; reaction time 3 h; and reaction scale
15 mmol (4.66 g of 2b)]. Distilled ethyl oleate of 95%
purity was prepared from inexpensive technical-grade oleic acid and
renewable bioethanol and stored over alumina (I activity, neutral,
70–230 mesh, Merck) prior to use. The rationale behind using
ethyl ester 2b, instead of more popular methyl ester 2a, was the availability of ethanol as a stream from other
production activities. In addition, as we learned during distillation
tests, the higher boiling point difference between 3 and 2b (the ethyl ester has a higher boiling point as compared
with 2a) allowed for easier separation of these two products
and led to more pure fractions even after single distillation (see
the Supporting Information for more details).
For the planned wide-screening tests,16 we selected a rather broad set of Ru complexes (Figure 1), composed of various types
of compounds, and not excluding the catalysts tailored for specific
applications, such as polymerization (Ru-28–Ru-29, Ru-34–Ru-35), as well as polar (Ru-38) or even chiral (Ru-27) Ru complexes, in order not
to overlook a potential hit. The other rationale behind selecting
such a heterogeneous set of complexes was to find the relationships
between the structures of such diverse complexes and the conversion
and selectivity exhibited by them in the ethenolysis reaction performed
(Figure 1 and Table 1). It should be noted
that although we always observed in the postreaction mixtures the
undesired diethyl 9-octadecene-1,18-dioate and 9-octadecene (4b and 5), the amount of them was cleanly related
to the catalyst used. The smallest amount of these self-CM products
was observed for reactions with first-generation ruthenium catalysts
of Grubbs, Hoveyda–Grubbs, and indenylidene type (Table 1, Ru-1 to Ru-4). In all these cases, the sum of 4b and 5 was below 4%. The first-generation phosphine-based
complexes showed quite satisfying conversion of ethyl oleate (55–65%);
however, the yield of ethenolysis products (1-decene and ethyl decenoate)
was reduced by the presence of double bond migration products in the
reaction mixture (9–23%), making the product isolation quite
complicated. The second-generation complexes in general exhibited
a greater activity in both of these reactions, i.e., in the expected
CM with ethylene and unfortunately also in the self-CM process, leading
to byproducts 4b and 5.

The results presented in Table 1 cleanly showed that especially the symmetrical NHC-based
catalysts (Ru-5–Ru-16, Ru-21–Ru-25, Ru-31, and Ru-36–Ru-38) gave more
self-CM products than the first-generation complexes. Exhibiting selectivity
between 3 and 80%, these NHC-bearing complexes cannot compete with
the CAAC catalysts Ru-18–Ru-20, used as a benchmark
in our study (selectivity 83–99%). The only exception was the
SIPr catalyst Ru-17 displaying a comparable selectivity
of 89% and good activity. Nonetheless, all symmetrical SIMes NHC-bearing
catalyst, the third-generation complex (Ru-28), chiral Ru-27, and other specialized complexes appeared to be less
advantageous in the ethenolysis as compared with CAAC ones (Table 1). Also, variation
of the phosphine ligands does not bring to visible improvements. From
the results presented in Table 1, some general trends can be observed:Hoveyda-type SIMes catalysts substituted in the benzene
ring of the benzylidene moiety. The best results were observed in
the case of the NHCOCF3 group (Ru-9). The
introduction of other electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) led to lowering
the selectivity (Ru-11, Ru-12). The NO2 substituent, one of the strongest EWGs, caused even greater
decrease in selectivity (from 43% for Ru-5 to barely
3% for Ru-7). The other substituents (Me or OMe in Ru-15, Ru-24, Ru-25) do not cause
any effect considerably.

Hoveyda-type
catalysts substituted in the alkoxy part
of the benzylidene moiety. In our hands, modification of this part
of a molecule did not add any improvement to the conversion and selectivity
(see Ru-21, Ru-23 to Ru25).
The drop of selectivity in the case of Ru-37 and Ru-39 is similar to the one observed for the EWG-activated
catalysts described above.

Modification
of the NHC backbone while keeping N-aryl
substituents the same. In general, no positive effect was observed
for catalysts Ru-26, Ru-40 to Ru-54, which all showed inclination toward self-CM even in the presence
of ethylene. As this class of complexes is structurally diverse, no
precise conclusions can be drawn.

SIMes
versus SIPr NHC ligands. It was observed that
the complexes with the SIPr ligand (a ligand with 2,6-diisopropylphenyl
N-substituents) are more selective toward ethenolysis products (1b and 3) and gave better yields than their SIMes
analogues.

Replacement of chlorine with
iodine. A significant increase
of the selectivity almost in each case was observed. The same observation
can be extracted from the studies made by Pederson.17 For a prototypical Hoveyda–Grubbs second-generation
catalyst, the Cl into I exchange seems to be a quick and simple method
for making ethenolysis of 2b more effective. In this
case, we observed a prominent growth in selectivity from 43% (Ru-5) to 76% (Ru-6), while maintaining a quite
good conversion (77%). However, in some cases (e.g., Ru-18 vs Ru-19), this modification was associated with a
visible decrease of the catalyst activity.



Until now, the obtained results were rather disheartening, clearly
showing that CAAC catalysts exhibit the best combination of activity
and selectivity, and none of the complexes tested until now can compete
with them.

The Grubbs’ crucial observation that Ru complexes
with two
different N-substituents at the NHC moiety can exhibit up to 5070
TON in a glovebox-type ethenolysis of 2a(6c) prompted us to focus on similar complexes that were at
that time under development in our laboratories. To do so, 11 different
ruthenium catalysts bearing uNHC ligands were screened at the same
conditions as previously described (Table 1, Ru-55–Ru-65). We were
pleased to find that most of the studied complexes were able to secure
good conversion and high selectivity of the process, and only in the
case of nonstable15e pyrrole-substituted
complex Ru-65, the conversion was low (17%); however,
the selectivity was still high (91%). Interestingly, easy to be synthesized
N-benzyl-substituted complexes (Ru-55 to Ru-60)15a,15b,15d also revealed
high efficiency toward ethenolysis of ethyl oleate (Table 1). The most promising catalyst
was however the thiophene-substituted analogue of the above (Ru-63).15f In this case, we observed
the highest selectivity (90%) toward the desired ethenolysis products 1b and 3. This selectivity level is comparable
with the selectivity observed for the best CAAC-type complexes11 and was fully satisfactory for the industrial
partner. The halide exchange reaction led to the complex Ru-64 of even more increased selectivity (to 99%), which was however paired
with the decreased catalytic activity (conversion of 42%).

Having
selected the set of uNHC complexes characterized by the
excellent selectivity and good activity, a brief optimization of conditions
was made (Table 2).
In order to observe potential differences in the effectiveness of
NHC and uNHC catalysts, three representative complexes were selected
from two different catalyst families: SIPr-bearing complex Ru-24 (that exhibited high activity but not full selectivity) and two
uNHC-bearing complexes Ru-59 and Ru-63 that
were more selective but less active. We checked the influence of the
reaction temperature (30 °C, 50 °C, and 80 °C), time
(from 1 to 6 h), and finally, the ethylene pressure (2, 10, and 20
bar). These results revealed that the initially selected temperature
(50 °C) seems to be optimal; however, there was no drastic erosion
of selectivity observed at higher temperature, especially for the
catalyst Ru-63. Also, our initial choice of reaction
time and pressure was close to the optimal, as 1 h reaction time was
visibly insufficient to ensure the high conversion, and at the same
time, decrease in the pressure of ethylene caused erosion of selectivity
or conversion, or both (Table 2). The best results were observed when the reaction was conducted
for a longer time (3–6 h) and at higher ethylene pressure (20
bar) to give—for the winning complex Ru-63 at
200 ppm loading—conversion above 70% and selectivity of 93%
(Table 2).

d Selectivity = 100 × (moles

The final and last step in our study was to try reducing the catalyst
loading, as this can affect favorably the cost-effective parameter
of the planned process. Keeping in mind that the use of glovebox or
Schlenk techniques is not permitted, so using the same conditions
and reagents’ purity we run the ethenolysis reaction with 200,
100, 50, and 25 ppm of the catalyst Ru-63 (Table 3). The results showed that the
satisfactory conversion can be achieved for a catalyst loading equal
to 100 ppm, whereas 2b handling and an autoclave charging
were made in air. Although the main goal of this work was to find
the most robust and selective catalyst within a set of structurally
diverse Ru complexes, we decided in addition to test the selected
catalyst Ru-63 in an ethenolysis of 2b at
a larger scale. In this experiment, we used nondistilled ethyl oleate
of 90% gas chromatography (GC) purity. This substrate was made by
the esterification of crude oleic acid, and instead of distillation,
it was purified by the treatment with Magnesol (5 wt %), activated
alumina (2.5 wt %), activated carbon (2.5 wt %), and degassed in vacuo
(for a detailed procedure, see the Supporting Information). Such obtained nondistilled ethyl oleate can be
stored for prolonged periods of time. Immediately before the ethenolysis
reaction, the required amount of 2b was again degassed
under vacuum at 50 °C for 0.5 h.

The
proof-of-concept large-scale ethenolysis was done as follows
(Scheme 3): a 2 L reactor
was evacuated under vacuum and a precooledb mixture
of substrate 2b (1 L) and catalyst Ru-63 (150 ppm)c was sucked into the reactor. The
reaction was run at 50 °C under the ethylene pressure of 20 bar.
Ethenolysis was carried out for 2 h, ethylene was removed from the
reactor, and then the reactor was flushed twice with a nonflammable
gas. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was analyzed by GC, which
showed the formation of only small amounts of unwanted “homodimers” 4b (1.5%) and 5 (1.1%), whereas the conversion
of 2b was 56%.19 The reaction
mixture was then transferred into a vessel containing 660 ppm of the
SnatchCat metal scavenger,18 1,4-bis(3-isocyanopropyl)piperazine 6 (4.4 equiv relative to the catalyst), and directly submitted
to fractional distillation under reduced pressure. The relatively
big difference between the boiling points of the products allowed
to obtain practically pure fractions of 1b (33% yield)
and 3 (30% yield) after just single distillation event,
and the waste interfraction was relatively small (see the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
The ethenolysis reaction of ethyl oleate
has been performed to
allow the comparison between the structure of various catalysts and
their activity and selectivity under “practical” conditions.
The handling of the oleic substrate and weighing of the catalysts
were done in air, with exclusion of a glovebox or Schlenk techniques.
A wide set of 65 diverse Ru metathesis catalysts was investigated
under such conditions that mimic the oil industry practice, allowing
for the selection of the most robust and selective system, being a
Ru catalyst bearing the uNHC featuring a thiophene fragment (Ru-63). In addition, a proof-of-concept larger-scale ethenolysis
experiment was done with such a selected catalyst. Although this preliminary
experiment at only 1 L scale cannot be used to assess the economic
validity of the commercial-scale ethenolysis process, it shows that
by selecting a robust and selective catalyst the amount of unwanted
byproducts can be kept minimal. Research on improving the ethenolysis
efficiency with the catalyst Ru-63 and/or on recycling
of unreacted (E/Z)-2b will be continued in due time. In summary, we believe that the present
results define a starting point for future scale-up studies, which
hopefully allow finally for a green transformation of various types
of biomass19 into the valuable chemical,
9-decenoic acid (9-DA), by ethenolysis.

580 chromatograph with a flame ionization detector and a GL Sciences
InertCap 5MS/Sil Capillary Column (inner diameter 0.25 mm, length
30 m, df 0.50 μm). Tetradecane was
used as an internal standard in all screening low-scale experiments.
Calibration curves were generated for ethyl oleate, tetradecane, and
all the metathesis products 1b, 3, 4b, 5. GC–MS analyses were performed by
means of a PerkinElmer Clarus 680 chromatograph with a Mass Spectrometer
Clarus SQ 8C detector and GL Sciences InertCap 5MS/Sil Capillary Column
(inner diameter 0.25 mm, length 30 m, df 0.50 μm). The large-scale reaction mixture (Scheme 3) and distillation fractions
were analyzed with a PerkinElmer GC unit, with a GL Sciences InertCap
5MS/NP (inner diameter 0,25 mm, length 30 m) column, using the following
method: initial temperature 145° C—0.1 min—9 °C/min
to 180 °C—0.1 min—20 °C/min to 305 °C—2
min. The qualitative analysis of fractions was made using GCMS-QP2010
Ultra Shimadzu Zebron ZB-5MSi GC–MS hardware.

Ethenolysis
Tests Made in Small Scale (15 mmol, 4.66 g of 2b)—Tables 1–3
All catalysts, ethyl
oleate (for purification details, see the Supporting Information), and tetradecane (an internal standard) were weighed
and handled in air. Armar and Roth autoclaves used in this stage (Tables 1–3) were charged with the reactants in air. Catalysts’
stock solution were made in air using dry dichloromethane (DCM; from
the MB SPS-800 solvent purification system). A solution of a catalyst
(500, 200, 100, 50, and 25 ppm) in DCM (100 μL) was added to
a mixture of ethyl oleate (4.66 g, 15.0 mmol) and tetradecane (0.61
g, 3.05 mmol) placed in a glass vessel containing a magnetic stir
bar. The vessel was immediately installed into an autoclave, which
was then flushed three times with ethylene (2 or 10 or 20 bar). The
mixture was stirred at the temperature equal to 30 °C or 50 °C
or 80 °C for 1, 3, or 6 h. After that, a sample of the reaction
mixture was collected (1 mL) and immediately quenched with ethyl vinyl
ether (4 mL, used as 2 M solution in DCM). Next, an aliquot (0.2 mL)
was taken from this mixture and diluted with 0.8 mL of DCM. Such obtained
solution was analyzed by GC. Conversion was calculated using the internal
standard and calibration curves.

Large-Scale (1 L) Ethenolysis
and Distillation (Schemes 3 and S2)
Before each reaction
of ethenolysis, a 2 L Büchi
autoclave used in the large-scale experiments was washed with one
portion of DCM (800 mL), two portions of acetone (700 mL each), and
one portion of toluene (700 mL), with stirring for 5 min (800 rpm)
each time. Then the reactor was dried under reduced pressure (1–5
mbar) with the jacket heated to the temperature of 65 °C. A catalyst
stock solution was prepared as follows: the solid catalyst was weighed
in air into a 25 mL flask, which was then flushed with argon, and
the catalyst was dissolved in 14 mL of dry toluene (distilled over
Na). To a vacuum-heated 2 L flask substrate, 2b (870
g, 1000 mL, for purification details, see the Supporting Information) was added. The flask was cooled to
0 °C, and the catalyst solution (10 mL, 150 ppm) was added with
stirring. The ethenolysis reactor together with its gas supply line
was connected to vacuum, and the substrate–catalyst mixture
was vacuum-sucked into the reactor (reactor’s jacket temperature
was set equal to the reaction temperature), whereas the stirring speed
was set at 600 rpm. Next, ethylene was added to reach the set pressure,
and the reaction was carried out for 2 h. After this, ethylene gas
was removed from the reactor, which was flushed twice with argon,
to remove any traces of the flammable ethylene. A tiny sample of the
reaction mixture was subjected to GC, whereas the rest was transferred
into a vessel containing 660 ppm of 1,4-bis(3-isocyanopropyl)piperazine 6 (SnatchCat) (4.4 equiv relative to the catalyst). Directly
after quenching, the reaction mixture was subjected to fractional
distillation. A 1 L flask containing 600 g of the postreaction mixture
was connected to a glass distillation equipment containing a 44.5
cm long jacketed rectifying column. The entire distillation was carried
out at a pressure of 1–2 mbar. Three fractions were collected:
1-decene 3 fraction (purity 96%, 122.0 g), a mixed fraction
containing 1-decene together with 9-DA ethyl ester (3—38%, 1b—49%, 3.1 g), and the fraction
of 9-DA ethyl ester 1b (purity 97%, 179.5 g).

a Some authors define
the selectivity
in ethenolysis as follows: selectivity = (moles of ethenolysis products 1b and 3) × 100/(moles of total products 1b + 3 + 10 + 11).
However, as 1 mol of homodimer, 4b is produced from 2
mol of substrate 2b, and the same is true for the second
homoproduct 5, we, and the others, assume that the following
formula is more correct: selectivity = (moles of ethenolysis products 1b and 3) × 100/[(moles of 1b + moles of 3) + 2 × (moles of 4b +
moles of 5)]. As these two systems are simultaneously
present in the literature, comparing the catalyst selectivity levels
between different papers must be done with a care.

b Preliminary experiments have shown
that from the moment the catalyst is added to ethyl oleate until it
is completely drawn into the reactor and ethylene is introduced, it
takes about 10 min. As we checked, during this transfer, the catalyst
can promote the self-CM reaction of 2b (the “homodimerization”).
To avoid this undesired reaction, the catalyst was added to the substrate
cooled to 0 °C.

c Use of
100 ppm of Ru-63 led in scale 1 L to obtain slightly
lower conversion (43%).

Although no industrial
production utilizing well-defined molybdenum or tungsten alkylidenes
has yet been disclosed, these catalysts offer a number of advantages,
such as modularity, low propensity towards C–C double bond
isomerization and high selectivity in ethenolysis (see: ref (3)), to list only a few. Recently
some techniques to improve the inherent low air and water stability
of Mo- and W-catalysts, such as encapsulation into wax pills for convenient
storage and handling or using some trialkylaluminium additives, have
been developed, see: Ondi L. ; Nagy G. M. ; Czirok J. B. ; Bucsai A. ; Frater G. E.
