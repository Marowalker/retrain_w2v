The relationship of liquidus temperatures
among six binary and
four ternary phases in a Ag–Al–Sn–Zn system was
analyzed by means of statistical modeling. Four statistical models
to predict changes in the liquidus temperatures in Ag–Al–Sn–Zn
were proposed on the basis of different hypotheses derived from macroscopic
and microscopic standpoints. The results of interpolation tests to
evaluate the prediction accuracies of the ternary liquidus temperatures
suggested that the multivariate regression model based on binary liquidus
temperatures, interactive binary liquidus temperatures, and products
of atomic ratios was found to be the most effective among the four
models. It was numerically shown that the prediction accuracies of
the liquidus temperatures in local ternary systems of Ag–Al–Sn–Zn
can be improved further by using the models identified in their neighboring
systems. Finally, the possibility to extract the general trend and
the abnormal combination of elements for the prediction of liquidus
temperatures was discussed on the basis of the statistical framework
we considered.

1 Introduction
Recent advances in alloys and intermetallic compounds have attracted
much attention not only in metallurgy but also in chemistry and material
science. For example, nanoparticles of intermetallic compounds and
alloys have been intensively studied for their optical, magnetic,
and catalytic properties.1,2 Alloys with low melting
points, fusible alloys, are widely used in solders, coolants, fluxes,
etc. For instance, Ga–In–Sn and related alloys are liquids
around room temperature and they are studied for cathode contacts
for a light-emitting device,3 sonoluminescence,4 and H2 production sources.5 Thus, exploring new alloys with low melting points
is highly demanded. Liquidus temperatures, above which a material
is completely liquid, have been widely known in binary systems. These
data are summarized as databases of phase diagrams, which exhibit
various phase transitions in terms of temperature and atomic ratios
mostly under ambient pressure.6 However,
in ternary systems, there is only a limited number of phase diagrams.7 In more complex systems, there are much less
studies involved.8 The most established
approach for the prediction of a phase diagram is based on macroscopic
approaches using thermodynamic parameters.9−11 Thermodynamic
parameters include enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity for each phase
and the free energy calculated by these parameters should be minimized
to reach a thermodynamic equilibrium condition. Thermodynamic software
packages have been developed on the basis of these thermodynamic data.12−14 Nonetheless, such predictions are not simple issues and experimental
data is still necessary for the prediction. Experimental studies need
much efforts in terms of time and cost.

The other approach to
understand liquidus temperatures is based
on microscopic approaches, including atomic vibration and electronic
interaction of atomic orbitals. More than a century ago, Lindemann
estimated melting points of metals and compounds on the basis of atomic
vibration (Lindemann criterion), although the quantitative estimation
of the melting point is difficult.15 Statistical
approaches are also utilized to know what factors affect the melting
points of metals and compounds. Chelikowsky and Anderson analyzed
the relationship between melting points of alloys and other factors:
electron count, atomic number, orbital radius, electronic negativity,
lattice parameter, etc.16 They found that
melting points of binary compounds with normal metals were moderately
related to the change in their volumes. Atsuto et al. statistically
analyzed the melting points of single metals and binary compounds
and various factors calculated by density functional theory: volume,
bulk module, etc.17 Nonetheless, these
studies are limited to simple substances and stoichiometric binary
compounds and not alloys with various atomic ratios. Although statistical
approaches have attracted great attention, there is still a limit
in predicting melting points.

Predicting melting points by microscopic
and macroscopic approaches,
the prediction of melting points of ternary or a higher system is
still challenging. Considering the recent attention to data analysis,
including machine learning, and to high throughputs and statistical
analyses for exploring new materials,18−25 data analyses must be useful for predicting melting points and have
the potential for mining the clues for finding undiscovered correlations,
including microscopic and macroscopic views. In this work, we statistically
analyzed liquidus temperatures of ternary phase diagrams using that
of the binary phase diagram in the Ag–Al–Sn–Zn
system. Ag–Al–Sn–Zn systems have been intensively
studied to develop lead-free solder, and all of the four ternary and
six binary phase diagrams are thus available. The accuracy of the
prediction of ternary liquidus temperatures was improved by the linear
regression model, including both the interaction of two binary liquidus
temperatures and atomic interactions. Further improvement was achieved
by the hierarchical model, which included extended ternary liquidus
temperatures.

2 Data Sets and Construction
of Models
2.1 Data
The data of atomic ratios and
liquidus temperatures of binary and ternary phase diagrams in the
Ag–Al–Sn–Zn system were extracted from the database
books6,7 and a publication26 by using WebPlotDigtizer software.27 Thus,
the data sets were composed of atomic ratios and liquidus temperature
on contour lines, at every 50 or 100 °C.

2.2 Construction
and Evaluation of Regression
Models for Explaining the Change in Liquidus Temperatures
In this subsection, we consider statistical approaches to predict
liquidus temperatures in ternary systems from atomic ratios and liquidus
temperatures in binary and ternary phase diagrams. Let CA, CB, and Cc be the atomic ratios of A, B, and C in the ternary A–B–C
system (0 < CA < 1, 0 < CB < 1, 0 < Cc < 1, CA + CB + Cc = 1), respectively. Moreover,
melting points of A, B, and C are represented as TA, TB, and TC, respectively. Liquidus temperatures in the A–B
binary system are written as TA–B(CA/(CA + CB)), and so on. At atomic ratios in a ternary
A–B–C system, ternary liquidus temperatures are denoted
as TA–B–C(CA, CB, Cc). Here, we proposed four statistical models, (i)–(iv),
to estimate ternary liquidus temperatures, TA–B–C(CA, CB, Cc), on the basis
of different assumptions.(i) Multivariate regression model based
on binary liquidus temperatures:

We assume that liquidus temperatures
in a ternary phase diagram, TA–B–C(CA, CB, Cc), are influenced by binary liquidus temperatures, TA–B(CA/(CA + CB)), TB–C(CB/(CB + CC)), and TC–A(CC/(CC + CA)). By settling
the degrees of the affection from binary liquidus temperatures as
parameters, the following model is proposed  where a0–a3 are unknown coefficients
and ε is the
disturbance term associated with a normal distribution. The unit of
measure of a0 is in °C and others
are unitless. A maximum likelihood estimation based on the data sets
of TA–B–C(CA, CB, Cc), TA–B(CA/(CA + CB)), TB–C(CB/(CB + CC)), and TC–A(CC/(CC + CA)) gives the estimated values of aj. Then, the predictor for TA–B–C(CA, CB, Cc) using these
three binary liquidus temperatures can be constructed.

(ii) Multivariate regression model based
on interactive binary liquidus temperatures:

The model (i) represents
the independent effect of three binary liquidus temperatures on ternary
liquidus temperatures. However, we cannot deny the possibility of
interactive effects between two binary liquidus temperatures. We therefore
represented such interactive effects as the products of two binary
liquidus temperatures: TA–B(CA/(CA + CB))·TB–C(CB/(CB + CC)). The regression model with interactive effects
is proposed as below  where parameters b1–b6 are
unknown coefficient parameters.
The units of b1–b3 are in °C and b4–b6 are unitless.

(iii) Multivariate regression model based
on atomic interactions:

Assuming a homogeneous distribution
of mixed elements with the same geometric size, the ratio of interactive
bonds between A and B can be described as CA·CB. Similarly, the ratios of the
bonds between A and A can be described as CA2. Considering that all of the atomic interactions affect
the liquidus temperature in the ternary system, the following model
is proposed  where c1–c6 were unknown coefficients.
The units of c1–c6 are
in °C.

(iv) Multivariate
regression model based
on interactive binary liquidus temperatures and ratio of atomic interactions:

In the model (iii), we assumed atomic interactions occur in a homogeneous
distribution of mixed elements with the same geometric size. It would
be more likely, however, that they occur in an inhomogeneous distribution
in different geometric sizes in a ternary liquid. In other words,
the model (iii) may be too simplified considering atomic orbitals
and their interactions. Therefore, we also propose the regression
model taking into account both interactive binary liquidus temperatures
and atomic interactions by linear combination of the models (ii) and
(iii). In this model (iv), we may consider that an inhomogeneous distribution
with different atomic orbitals are represented by binary liquidus
temperatures.   where d1–d12 are unknown coefficient
parameters. The units
for d1–d6 are in °C, whereas the units for d7–d12 are in °C–1.



It is difficult to theoretically show
which model is
the most reasonable because these statistical models are proposed
on the basis of different hypotheses. To evaluate the effectiveness
of the four models, we introduce Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),28 given by  The first term is log likelihood of the fitted
model and decreases as the number of parameters increases. The second
term is a penalty one and monotonously increases with increasing the
number of parameters included in a model. We therefore select the
model providing a minimum value of AIC as the best one.

3 Results
Statistic models were evaluated by three steps.
First, we predicted
liquidus temperatures on the basis of four statistic models to find
which model was most effective (Section 3.1). Second, we further evaluated the most
effective model by interpolation tests (Section 3.2). Finally, we predicted the ternary liquidus
temperature in more practical situations, such as prediction from
limited initial data sets and expanded ternary liquidus temperatures
(Section 3.3).

3.1 Fitting the Regression Models
Figure 1 shows the contour
map of experimental liquidus temperatures and predicted liquidus temperatures
of Al–Ag–Zn ternary phase on the basis of the models
(i)–(iv). The prediction of the model (i) is poor especially
in Al- and Ag-rich regions. The predicted liquidus temperatures in
the Al-rich region by the model (ii) improve from those of the model
(i). The prediction of the liquidus temperatures by the model (iii)
further improves in the Al- and Ag-rich region. The model (iv) is
the most predictable. The prediction accuracy near the kink at the
composition at Al0.57Ag0.36Zn0.07 is also improved by using model (iv) when compared with that predicted
by other models. The maximum error of the model (iv) in this region
is approximately 30 °C. Further improvement of the model remains
a challenge, which may be achieved by using nonlinear regression models.

Figure 1 Experimental
Al–Ag–Zn liquidus temperature (left)
and the difference between experimental and predicted Al–Ag–Zn
liquidus temperatures on the basis of four statistic models (right).
In the experimental data (left), the thick lines are contour lines
at every 50 °C. In the difference of liquidus temperatures (right),
data points are located along the thick lines. The color and thin
lines at every 25 °C are driven by linear interpolation on data
points.

Table 1 shows the
number of data (N), the values of AIC, and the adjusted
coefficients of determination (Adj-R2)
for each ternary system. The values of Adj-R2 suggest that the models (ii), (iii), and (iv) are fitted
better than the model (i). AIC values are different depending on the
models but have the tendency regardless of individual systems. AIC
values tend to decrease from the model (i) to (iv). The above results
suggest that the model (iv) can be evaluated as the most effective
structure for explaining the change in liquidus temperatures in the
proposed four models.

and asterisks indicate that parameters are significantly different
from zero at a 5% level. All of the variables, except the parameter
of binary liquidus temperature in the Ag–Zn–Sn system,
have significant impacts upon changes in liquidus temperatures. These
results are in accordance with our assumption about the model; ternary
liquidus temperature can be expressed by interactive binary liquidus
temperatures and the ratio of interacting bonds.

3.2 Prediction Accuracy of Liquidus Temperature
by Interpolation Test
In the following subsection, we evaluated the
prediction accuracy
of ternary liquidus temperatures by using the models presented in
the previous subsection. For this purpose, we carried out the statistical
interpolation test, described as below. First, we identified the models
(i)–(iv) using the data of binary and ternary liquidus temperatures.
Then, the prediction accuracy of ternary liquidus temperatures by
using the models was evaluated by the difference between actual data
and the estimated values.

Figures 2–5 show the results of the prediction of liquidus
temperatures in four ternary systems with the models (i)–(iv).
The distribution diagrams shown in the left side exhibit that the
estimated values close to the broken line represent the ideal estimation.
The accuracy of the estimation tends to improve from the results by
using the models (i), (ii), and (iii). Histograms in the right side
show the distribution of prediction errors: the difference between
the actual and estimated temperatures. Table 3 shows the number of data used for the interpolation
test (N), the average of the estimated error (μ̂e), standard deviation (σ̂e), and root
mean square errors (RMSEs).

Table 3 shows that
σ̂e and RMSE of the statistical models improve
from the models (i)/(ii) to the model (iii) and further improve to
the model (iv). The comparison between the models (i) and (ii) suggests
that the interactions of binary liquidus temperatures are effective
for the prediction except in the Sn–Ag–Zn system. The
model (iii) is further improved by considering only atomic interactions
using the products of atomic ratios. Thus, the model with atomic interactions
would be more effective for the prediction than the model with binary
liquidus temperature. The model (iv), a linear combination of the
models (ii) and (iii), lowers standard deviations and RMSE of the
model (iii) by ca. 10, giving the best prediction accuracy among the
four models. These accuracies indicate that the model (iv) is practically
useful for describing ternary liquidus temperatures.

3.3 Application of the Model to the Prediction
of Ternary Liquidus Temperatures in Some Practical Aspect
In this section, we investigate whether the model (iv) is also available
for prediction of ternary liquidus temperatures in a more practical
situation. We examined the prediction of ternary liquidus temperatures
using the statistical model (iv) proposed in the previous section.
The prediction was performed by a partial data set of TA–B–C(Ca, Cb, Cc) and used
to evaluate the remaining data set.

3.3.1 Predicting
Ternary Liquidus Temperature
from Specific Situations
In this subsection, we consider
whether the model (iv) has the predictability of ternary liquidus
temperatures under the condition that experimental data are obtained
in a specific situation. As an example, we investigate the prediction
accuracy in the situation that all of the data of ternary composition
are close to that of binary composition.

The prediction test
is carried out in the following way. First, we define the values of
the ratios, R0 and R1, satisfying 0 < R0 ≤ R1 < 1. Then, we prepare the two data sets
on the atomic ratios, CA, CB, and CC, which satisfies
the following conditions;(a) CA < R0 or CB < R0 or CC < R0

(b) CA > R1 and CB > R1 and CC > R1



The data set satisfying (a) is used for
model identification and
the other one satisfying (b) is used for the prediction test for TA–B–C (Ca, Cb, Cc). The prediction accuracy can be statistically evaluated by a similar
experiment as presented in Section 3.2

3.3.2 Validity of the Statistical
Model
Figure 6 shows the
liquidus temperature derived by the exploration test. The predicted
data shown in the middle are similar to experimental data, showing
that prediction accuracies are practically allowable. Figure 7 shows the distribution of
prediction errors on liquidus temperature in four ternary systems
under R0 = R1 = 0.1. Table 4 summarizes
the numbers of data for the estimation (N0) and the prediction test (N1), the average
prediction error (μ̂e), the standard deviation
of the prediction errors (σ̂e), and RMSE under R0 = 0.1 and R1 =
0.1, 0.2, and 0.25. It is important to note that the value of the
statistical criteria (i.e., μ̂e, RMSE) tends to be unstable as R1 becomes larger because N1 decreases. The result shows that RMSE of the predicted values
are distributed in the range of 10–30 °C, whose accuracies
are practically allowable. It is concluded that the statistic model
(iv) is effective for prediction.

temperatures in an extrapolation test with R0 = R1 = 0.1 (right). Data set
without grey region (left) is used for the identification of the model
(iv). The color indicator of the prediction error ranges from −75
to + 75 °C, which is not same for the indicator in Figure 1.

3.3.3 Improvement
of the Predictability Based
on Extended Ternary Systems
In this subsection, we are interested
in whether the predictive accuracy of ternary liquidus temperatures
can be improved by considering extended ternary systems. We examine
this point by considering a statistical model with a hierarchical
structure. Suppose that we estimate the liquidus temperatures in the
A–B–C system on the basis of the three adjusted systems,
A–B–X, B–C–Y and A–C–Z.
First, we write the model to express TA–B–C(CA, CB, Cc) in the A–B–C system. I  where (aj, bj) (j =
1–6) are unknown
coefficients, T*A–B–X(CA, CB), T*B–C–Y(CB, CC), and T*C–A–Z(CC, CA), respectively, stand for liquidus temperatures
of the statistical modes in A–B–X, B–C–Y,
and C–A–Z systems, and ε means the disturbance
term following normal distribution. Because T*A–B–X, T*B–C–Y, and T*C–A–Z are unknown,
it is necessary to estimate these values in A–B–X, B–C–Y,
and A–C–Z systems.

Here, we assume that ternary
liquidus temperatures follow the statistic model (iv) presented in
the previous system. In the A–B–X system, for example,
the model can be written by II  Where (pj, qj) (j =
1–6) are unknown
parameters. To estimate the value of TA–B–X(CA, CB, CX), for example, it is necessary to know the
situation of T*A–B–X(CA, CB, Cx) on the basis of the model (II). Under CX = 0, the following relationship holds  where TA and TB represent melting points of A and B. Therefore,
the model (II) in this situation can be rewritten as III  It is possible to estimate
the values of the
parameters (pj, qj) by using the data obtained in the A–B–X system, and
therefore the estimation value of T*A–B–X(CA, CB)
can also be obtained by using the fitted model. The values of T*B–C–Y and T*A–C–Z can be estimated in the same way by using
the data obtained in B–C–Y and C–A–Z systems,
respectively. The model (I) can be identified by the following two
steps. First, we estimate the values of T*A–B–X, T*B–C–Y and T*A–C–Z by fitting the model (III). Then,
the coefficient parameters (aj, bj) in the model (I) are estimated. The predicted
values of TA–B–X(CA, CB, CX) can be obtained by using the fitted model of (I).

In the following, we examine the prediction accuracy by using the
model (I). To investigate whether the model has advantage in the prediction
accuracy, we carried out the similar prediction experiments, as stated
in Section 3.2 and
then compared the accuracy among the following methods;(M1) The multivariate
model based on atomic
interaction (i.e., the model (iii) defined in Section 2.2)

(M2) The multivariate model from interactive
binary liquidus temperatures and the ratio of interactive bonds (i.e.,
the model (iv) defined in Section 2.2)

(M3) The
method presented above. Note
that for the prediction of liquidus temperature in the Ag–Al–Sn
system using Ag–Zn–Al, Sn–Ag–Zn, and Zn–Al–Sn
systems as extended systems, X = Y = Z = Zn.



Figure 8 and Table 5(a)–(d) show
the results of the prediction experiment on the liquidus temperatures
in four systems, which are similar to those carried out in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.2. Specific steps for our test are as follows.
First, we listed the liquidus temperatures in accessing order, and
numbered the data points of atomics ratios and liquidus temperatures.
The odd numbers of the data are used for the estimation of coefficient
parameters by a maximum likelihood estimation, and the even number
of the data with different R1 values,
which are defined in Section 3.3.1, are used for the statistical evaluation of the model
on the basis of the error. In the tables, the number of data identification
(N0) and prediction test (N1), the mean (μ̂e) and standard
deviation (σ̂e) of the prediction errors, and
RMSE are shown. We see that (M3) tends to give better prediction accuracies
than those of (M1) and (M2). This suggests that the extended ternary
systems improve the prediction accuracy obtained by using the model
considered in the extended ternary systems.

4 Discussion
The results
of our analyses in the Ag–Al–Sn–Zn
system suggest that atomic ratios and binary liquidus temperatures
are effective factors to predict the distribution of ternary liquidus
temperatures. The analyses taking in the product terms on atomic ratios
and binary liquidus temperatures further improved the prediction of
ternary liquidus temperatures. Assuming a homogeneous distribution
of mixed elements with the same geometric size, the products of the
atomic ratios can be interpreted as the ratios of interactive bonds
in the nearest neighborhood in a microscopic view. All of the coefficients
of these products of the atomic ratios are significant and positive,
thus interactive bonds in the nearest neighborhood should increase
ternary liquidus temperatures. On the other hand, binary liquidus
temperatures and their interaction terms can be understood as other
microscopic factors to predict ternary liquidus temperatures. Thus,
the structure of model (iv), which is the most effective to predict
ternary liquidus temperatures, can be understood as the linear combination
of microscopic and macroscopic factors.

The statistic model
(iv) for the prediction of ternary liquidus
temperatures can be interpreted as microscopic atomic interaction
modified by macroscopic binary liquidus temperatures. On this basis,
the coefficients of atomic interaction can be related to elemental
factors. Figure 9 shows
the ratios of metallic radii and coefficients of the products of atomic
ratios. We observed a positive correlation between the ratios of metallic
radii and the coefficients of the products of atomic ratios, with
the exception found in the combination between Ag and Sn. The coefficients
of the products of atomic ratios are considered as strength factors
of atomic interactions because high liquidus temperatures are generally
attributed to strong chemical interactions between composed elements.
Thus, the statistical analysis of liquidus temperatures suggests that
the increase in the ratios of atomic radii strengthen atomic interactions.
The coefficients of the combination between Ag and Sn are found to
be abnormally low. The Ag–Sn system is a well-known system
for lead-free solder. Thus, this statistical approach finds new designing
principles by revealing the linear trend between the ratios of atomic
radii and the strength of atomic interaction.

Figure 9 Relationship between
the ratio of metallic radii and coefficients
of products of atomic ratios. A blue broken line represents the linear
regression line except the coefficients of Ag–Sn.

The prediction tests of ternary liquidus temperatures
from binary
liquidus temperatures and the part of ternary liquidus temperatures
give allowable accuracy, which are useful for designing materials
or synthesis protocols. The proposed structural model can handle not
only ternary liquidus temperatures but also extended ternary liquidus
temperatures. Although further research is essential to establish
general trends of these statistical approaches, this statistical work
shows the possibility of the prediction of ternary or higher systems
by combining data of binary and ternary systems.

5 Conclusions
In this article, we analyzed liquidus temperatures of six binary
and four ternary systems in a Ag–Al–Sn–Zn system
by means of statistical modeling. We found that products of atomic
ratios, binary liquidus temperatures, and their interactions are effective
as descriptors for ternary liquidus temperatures. The multivariate
regression model based on products of atomic ratios, binary liquidus
temperatures and their interactions was found to be effective from
the standpoint of AIC. The prediction accuracy of the extrapolation
test was found to be practically allowable, which suggested statistical
reasonableness of the model structure. From the chemical standpoint,
this model can be interpreted as the microscopic atomic interactions
modified by macroscopic binary liquidus temperatures.

We also
found out that the prediction accuracies of the liquidus
temperatures in a ternary system of Ag–Al–Sn–Zn
can be improved further by using the models identified in their neighboring
ternary systems. This result implies that this method may have the
potential of general prediction on liquidus temperatures.

The
statistical framework that we have considered throughout this
article possibly gives new application to various chemical properties
related to atomic interactions, which are not limited to liquidus
temperatures. For example, by considering the coefficients of the
products of atomic ratios as strengths of atomic interaction, a linear
trend between the ratios of atomic radii and the strength of atomic
interaction was found and the abnormally weak interaction between
Ag and Sn was also suggested. The proposed models are potentially
applicable to other properties related to the atomic interactions.
