Recent research suggests that exercise
may help facilitate abstinence
from cocaine addiction, though the mechanisms are not well understood.
In mice, wheel running accelerates the extinction of conditioned place
preference (CPP) for cocaine, providing an animal model for evaluating
potential neurological mechanisms. The objective of this study was
to quantify dynamic changes in endogenous peptides in the amygdala
and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in mice exposed to a context
paired with the effects of cocaine, and in response to exercise. Male
C57BL/6J mice conditioned to cocaine were housed with or without running
wheels for 30 days. Following a CPP test and final exposure to either
a cocaine- or saline-associated context, peptides were measured in
brain tissue extracts using label-free matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
mass spectrometry (MS) and stable isotopic labeling with liquid chromatography
and electrospray ionization MS. CPP in mice was significantly reduced
with running, which correlated to decreased myelin basic protein derivatives
in the dentate gyrus extracts, possibly reflecting increased unmyelinated
granule neuron density. Exposure to a cocaine-paired context increased
hemoglobin-derived peptides in runners and decreased an actin-derived
peptide in sedentary animals. These results allowed us to characterize
a novel set of biomarkers that are responsive to exercise in the hippocampus
and in a cocaine-paired context in the amygdala.

Introduction
Relapse presents a
major obstacle to successful recovery from drug
addiction. One factor that can lead to relapse, even in recovered
drug abusers, is re-exposure to drug-related cues (e.g., drug paraphernalia,
places where drugs were taken or people drugs were taken with), which
can trigger powerful feelings of craving.1−4 Finding interventions that help
extinguish the cravings induced by drug-paired cues is a critical
step for designing more effective rehabilitation treatments. There
is evidence that incorporating aerobic exercise can improve addiction
rehabilitation outcomes,5−7 but the mechanisms are not well
understood.

Exercise-induced changes in the brain have been
hypothesized to
alter learned associations between contextual cues and drug reward.
In the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, a model of drug-to-context
association and reward,8−10 an animal is repeatedly exposed to a drug of abuse
in one context and to a neutral substance in an alternate context
so that the animal learns to associate the drug with the one context.
The animal is then tested for its preference for the drug-associated
context relative to the neutral context. In the animal literature,
exercise has been shown to reduce cocaine-induced CPP.8−10 One mechanism by which running may accelerate the extinction of
drug-to-context associations may be by modifying the levels of endogenous
peptides. On the basis of previous mRNA expression studies, running
is thought to induce robust peptide changes in the brain. For instance,
running increases the expression of dynorphin mRNA in brain reward
pathways.11,12 Considering that mRNA levels of neuropeptide
precursor proteins do not always correlate to the endogenously processed
peptide levels, measuring actual peptide dynamics in the brain reward
regions under cocaine-induced CPP and exercise conditions may provide
new insights into the chemistry of associative learning.

The
objective of this study was to evaluate endogenous peptide
levels in the amygdala and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in response
to running and cocaine-context re-exposure via mass spectrometry (MS),
which measures the endogenous peptides directly at the sites of their
action. To achieve this goal, tissue extracts were compared for detectable
peptide changes induced by running and by exposure to a cocaine-associated
context with two MS-based neuropeptidomics approaches, matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS, and stable isotopic labeling
using succinic anhydride (SA) followed by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC–MS).13−15 The hippocampus, and the dentate
gyrus in particular, undergoes unique changes in response to exercise,
including but not limited to neurogenesis,16,17 which changes the structural and molecular composition and in turn
might alter the biochemical profile in this region. Thus, we hypothesized
that we would observe differences in endogenous peptide levels resulting
from exercise in the dentate gyrus. Because the amygdala is critical
for context-induced behavior and plays a key role in CPP for cocaine,18−20 we expected the amygdala to show changes in peptide levels from
exposure to a cocaine-associated context. We also expected the peptides
up or down regulated in the dentate gyrus in response to exercise
to prevent modulation of context-induced amygdala peptides for the
following reasons. First, the hippocampus is known to project to the
amygdala and modify eventual amygdala output21 and second exercise is protective against cocaine-primed and stress-induced
reinstatement of cocaine seeking,22 which
may be achieved by cue-induced peptide modulation.

Results and Discussion
CPP Results
The experimental design for the CPP training,
testing, and re-exposure is presented graphically in Figure 1A. The behavioral results correspond
well to what was reported in previous work.9,23 For
mice housed with running wheels, running increased from days 1–12
and maintained a plateau for the remaining days (e.g., day was significant, F31,1267 = 15.46, p < 0.0001)
(Figure 1B). The average
level of running across all mice was 5.6 ± 0.2 km/day. There
was no significant effect of cohort, indicating that animals in cohort
1 and cohort 2 ran comparable distances on the running wheels.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic
diagram of the animal conditioning and testing for
CPP. Mice underwent 4 days of conditioning followed by 30 days housed
in cages with or without running wheels. Following that 1 day of CPP
testing was performed to assess the effects of exercise on conditioning.
The context re-exposure was performed with one of the two contexts
(cocaine or vehicle) and sacrifice occurred immediately after context
re-exposure. (B) Behavioral results in terms of wheel running. Average
distance run (km/day) (±SE) for the mice housed with running
wheels. The arrows indicate the testing day and the re-exposure day,
both of which show reduced wheel running activity, since animals were
removed from wheels for portions of these days. (C) Behavioral results
for CPP testing reported as mean difference in duration (min) ±SE
spent on the HOLE texture between animals receiving cocaine on a HOLE
texture (conditioned stimulus (CS) + HOLE) and animals receiving cocaine
on a GRID texture (CS + GRID), plotted separately for runner and sedentary
mice. The white bar represents data for 45 mice (n = 22 runner CS+ HOLE; n = 23 runner CS + GRID);
the gray bar represents data for 43 mice (n = 21
sedentary CS + HOLE; n = 22 sedentary CS + GRID).
The asterisks indicate significant place preference at p < 0.05.

In the CPP test, a significant
main effect of the cocaine-paired
context (F1,82 = 25.95, p < 0.0001) was observed in both sedentary and runner mice. There
was no significant effect of cohort, indicating that mice in cohort
1 and cohort 2 displayed similar magnitudes of CPP. The interaction
between the cocaine-paired context and exercise was not significant F1,82 = 1.66, p = 0.20; (Figure 1C), which is consistent
to previous work9 showing that the difference
in CPP between sedentary and runners occurs on day 2 of CPP, not day
1.

MALDI MS Profiling
Following the CPP testing, peptides
were extracted from the dentate gyrus and amygdala, and peptide profiles
were investigated by MS. Initially, small portions of each extract
were assayed via MALDI MS for individual animals (n = 48 total; n = 11, sedentary control group (saline-context
re-exposed); n = 12, sedentary experimental group
(cocaine-context re-exposed); n = 13, runner control
group (saline-context re-exposed); and n = 12 runner
experimental group (cocaine-context re-exposed)). Peptide signal intensities
were normalized to an internal standard for statistical analysis.
By optimizing the acquisition parameters, the collected spectra displayed
a high degree of reproducibility (Figure S1). For dentate gyrus extracts, there were 50 ions with a signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) >3 in the mean spectrum for each of the 4 treatment
groups.
The 2 × 2 between-within analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were
run using the normalized intensities for each detected ion signal,
where treatment (runner or sedentary) and context at re-exposure (experimental
or control) were between-groups factors and the iteration (i.e., sample
spot) was a within-subjects variable (five technical replicates per
animal). Peptides (15) were found to differ significantly (p < 0.05) with wheel running in the dentate gyrus, whereas
no peptides were found to differ significantly with exercise or with
context re-exposure in the amygdala. The remaining individual peptide
extracts were used to identify peptides via mass spectrometric sequencing,
followed by quantification using stable isotopic labeling, as described
in the following sections.

About 50% of the significantly changed
peptides between runners and sedentary mice in the dentate gyrus were
subsequently identified (Table S1) as shortened
forms of different isoforms of myelin basic protein (MBP), a major
constituent of the myelin sheath, which covers the axons of neurons
and enhances transmission of action potentials along the length of
the axons in white matter tracts. The measured ratios of these peptide
signals indicated higher levels in the sedentary mice (Figure 2 and Table 1). This finding is consistent to neuroanatomical
changes that are observed in response to exercise.24

difference due to exercise. Level changes are presented as signal

Relative Quantitation with
Stable Isotopic Labeling and LC–MS
Detection in the Dentate Gyrus
Our goal is to characterize
a broad level of peptides. Thus, an additional quantitation approach
was used to account for peptides in the extract potentially not detected
by MALDI-TOF MS. We used LC–ESI-MS because this ionization
approach creates distinct peptide lists compared to MALDI, especially
true with the lack of front-end separation in our high throughput
low-volume MALDI MS experiment.25−27 Because the statistical analysis
of the MALDI MS peptide profiles from the dentate gyrus indicated
significant peptide changes in response to exercise, stable isotopic
labeling and LC–MS detection were used to measure the relative
abundance of peptides in sedentary and runner mice. However, individual
extracts were combined into fewer samples (three per biological replicate,
three biological replicates per group, four groups, n = 36 total) to increase the amount of material for LC–MS
analysis, which lowered the statistical power for stable isotopic
labeling analysis compared to the MALDI MS measurements of individual
samples but provided the ability to characterize lower-level peptides.
Extracts from select animals from each experimental group were combined
into a pooled sample for peptide identification and run separately
from the quantitative measurement samples (n = 12).
To isolate the effects of wheel running, context re-exposure was controlled
by making the comparisons between the sedentary and runner groups
for the cocaine-context re-exposed animals and the saline-context
re-exposed animals, separately.

As expected, the chromatographic
separation prior to MS analysis yielded a higher number of detected
peptides than did the direct MALDI MS measurements. In total, 129
labeled peptide pairs were detected among all of the biological replicates
(n = 3 per group), and these were used for statistical
analysis. Applying the false discovery rate (FDR) correction and the
criterion of FDR < 0.1, only two peptides were found to differ
significantly in the dentate gyrus between the runner and sedentary
groups: calculated unlabeled masses 2119.94 and 2176.97 Da. Twelve
other peptides showed significant differences at an unadjusted p < 0.05; these candidate peptides are listed in Table 1. The labeled peptide
pairs that were found not to be significantly different between the
runner and sedentary groups are listed in Table S2.

Of the 15 peptides that were found to differ between
the runner
and sedentary groups in the dentate gyrus in the MALDI MS experiment,
8 were also detected by stable isotopic labeling and showed similar
ratios between groups; 7 of those 8 are derivates of MBP and 1 is
an unidentified peptide. Therefore, both quantitative methods reflect
intrinsic chemical characteristics of the sample set. Several potential
roles of MBP in cell-to-cell signaling have been proposed, including
acting as a membrane actin-binding protein in which MBP might participate
in the transmission of extracellular signals to the cytoskeleton in
oligodendrocytes and tight junctions in myelin, and as a binder of
polynucleotides in the cell nucleus, where it may affect gene expression.28 The difference in the levels of MBP between
sedentary and runner animals may reflect changes in myelination due
to exercise or signaling differences in runners or there may be less
present structurally due to remodeling from exercise.

On the
other hand, exercise has been shown to increase the volume
of gray matter, which is mostly unmyelinated, in the hippocampus.29 This fits with our observation of more MBP-related
peptides, which comprise the myelin in white matter, in sedentary
mice. A study in mice (ages 11–13 months) performed by Latimer
et al.24 found that with exercise, the
levels of MBP decreased, also fitting with our results. Myelination
is one form of plasticity and appears to play a role in how animals
behave in learning and memory tasks.30 Rigid
structuring of the white matter in the hippocampus by increased myelination
in sedentary animals may lay down pathways. It may also mean that
runners, with less myelin, have more cognitive flexibility in the
hippocampus, which would fit with our behavioral observation that
the CPP of runners starts at the same level as that of sedentary animals,
but decays more rapidly.8 Furthermore,
exercise-induced changes in the brain have demonstrated strong correlations
with improvements in cognitive function.31,32 If extinction of CPP is considered new learning, specifically, that
the intratest learning that the previously drug-paired context is
no longer predictive of drug reward, these data on the procognitive
effects of exercise fit with our behavioral observation of reduced
CPP in runner animals. More rigid and myelinated pathways may occur
in the dentate gyrus of sedentary animals, as evidenced by increased
MBP-related peptides in the dentate gyrus of tested sedentary mice.

Relative Quantitation with Stable Isotopic Labeling and LC–MS
Detection in the Amygdala
No significant changes were detected
between treatment groups in the amygdala peptide extracts by MALDI
MS, however, differential isotopic labeling and LC–MS analysis
were able to measure peptide changes with context re-exposure. This
discrepancy can be attributed to increased peptide detectability of
the LC–MS method used with isotopic labeling. To further increase
the statistical power of the LC–MS analysis, a second cohort
of mice (n = 39) was added specifically for investigating
the link between peptide changes and context re-exposure in the amygdala.
Individual samples (n = 22, sedentary control group
(saline-context re-exposed); n = 21, sedentary experimental
group (cocaine-context re-exposed); n = 23, runner
control group (saline-context re-exposed); and n =
21 runner experimental group (cocaine-context re-exposed, 87 mice
total)) were combined in triplicates into fewer biological replicates
(n = 6 per group) to increase the amount of material
available for the analysis; the rest of the mice (n = 15) were used for peptide identification. Although many labeled
peptide pairs (>100) were detected in each individual analysis,
only
39 labeled peptide pairs were consistently detected in samples from
both cohorts of the runner mice, and 36 labeled peptide pairs consistently
detected in samples from both cohorts of the sedentary mice. Attempts
were made to keep all conditions between cohorts consistent, however,
the animals in the two cohorts were acquired and sampled at different
times of the year. This discrepancy in timing could have led to some
peptides being unique to one cohort of animals. Of the peptides identified
by tandem MS (MS/MS) from the amygdala extracts, many were derived
from structural proteins, such as MBP and actin (see Tables S1 and S3).

In the analysis of peptide extracts
from the amygdala of runner mice, only one peptide was found to have
a significant change in abundance (FDR < 0.1) between animals re-exposed
to the cocaine-paired context and animals re-exposed to the control
context. As determined by LC–MS/MS, the peptide is derived
from β-hemoglobin and comes from the C-terminus of the protein.
This may occur if a highly salient stimulus, such as a context previously
paired with cocaine, activates the amygdala. Increased amygdala activation
may result in increases in blood flow to the area because this would
allow more hemoglobin into the amygdala, and this would affect the
hemoglobin levels later detected in this region. It has been shown
that cue-induced cocaine craving activates cerebral blood flow in
the limbic system, particularly in the amygdala.33,34 Three other peptides, all derived from α-hemoglobin, showed
differences at an unadjusted p < 0.05. All four
peptides showed a higher abundance in the animals re-exposed to the
cocaine-paired context compared to the control context and showed
significant differences based on context re-exposure in the runner
group, but not the sedentary group (Figure 3 and Table S1).

standard error. * Unadjusted p-values <0.05, indicating

In runner mice, the peptides that showed a higher relative
abundance
in animals re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context compared to the
control context are derived from α- and β-hemoglobin;
these are nonclassical signaling peptides that have been reported
to play a signaling role.35−37 The α- and β-subunits
of hemoglobin are expressed in neuronal cells,38,39 and several hemoglobin-derived peptides have been found to be uniquely
expressed in the brain.40 To date, there
are two classes of hemoglobin-derived peptides whose roles as cell–cell
signaling peptides have been extensively explored. The first class,
called hemopressins, is derived from α- and β-hemoglobin
and interacts with cannabinoid receptors.36,37,40 The second class, named hemorphins, consists
of several β-hemoglobin-derived peptides that interact with
opioid receptors.36,41 MS-based peptidomics studies
have identified hemopressin and hemorphin peptides, as well as other
peptides, derived from α- and β-hemoglobin.35,42−44 The hemoglobin-derived peptides identified in this
study are not hemopressin or hemorphin peptides. Therefore, their
peptide–receptor actions are not known. The β-hemoglobin-derived
peptide found to have a higher abundance in runner mice re-exposed
to a cocaine-paired context than in runner mice re-exposed to a neutral
context before sacrifice comes from the C-terminal of the sequence,
and has been detected in other MS-based peptidomic studies of the
mouse brain.35,42 The α-hemoglobin-derived
peptides identified in this study as having higher abundance in runner
mice re-exposed to a cocaine-paired context than in runner mice re-exposed
to a neutral context before sacrifice correlate to residues 107–123,
110–123, and 107–128. The largest of these peptides
(residues 107–128) has been observed in previous peptidomic
studies.35 The peptides we identified may
reflect a change in amygdala signaling in response to a drug context
cue in the amygdala of the runner animals or an increased blood flow
in response to running and a cocaine-associated cue.

When making
the same comparison of peptide extracts from the amygdala
of animals re-exposed to the different contexts in the sedentary group,
no peptides had a statistically significant (FDR < 0.1) change.
Two peptides showed differences between cocaine- and vehicle-paired
contexts at an unadjusted p < 0.05. One of these
peptides is actin [21–42], and the other could not be identified
(calculated unlabeled molecular weight (MW): 927.43 Da). Both peptides
were decreased in the animals re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context
compared to the animals re-exposed to the vehicle-paired context.
The observed log2-based fold change for the actin-derived
peptide between the context re-exposures (cocaine-paired context–vehicle-paired
context) was −1.33 ± 0.80 (mean ± SE). There is possibility
that the unidentified peptide is produced from a cytosolic protein
that functions in cell–cell signaling.35

Although only one actin-derived peptide showed a significant
change
in the cocaine-paired context, other actin-derived peptides were detected,
albeit with a high degree of variability between samples. The presence
of multiple different actin-derived peptides suggests that these peptides
in particular are reactive to drug cue exposure, perhaps due to cue-elicited
structural remodeling of this brain area.45 Actin is involved in the remodeling of neurons, and changes in actin
dynamics have been observed in tests of learning and memory.46 In addition, actin cycling has been shown to
increase in response to cocaine, potentially modulating cocaine-induced
reinstatement of drug seeking.47 The implication
for our study is that a mere drug context re-exposure may lead to
structural changes in the region of the brain that evaluates cue salience,
and those changes are measurable by chemical approaches.

A graph
depicting the average fold changes in signal intensity
for peptides of interest in the amygdala of sedentary mice in response
to context re-exposure is presented in Figure 3. A list of the identified peptides that
were not found to be significantly different with context re-exposure
in the amygdala is presented in Table S3. In the amygdala samples, most of the identified peptides were from
ubiquitous proteins, but two peptides were derived from two prohormone
precursors, somatostatin and proSAAS.

Postmortem analyses of amygdala from human drug abusers have
shown
cocaine-induced protein alterations relative to controls.48 A few animal studies have identified neuropeptides
differentially modulated in response to a drug in distinct brain regions
by MS techniques,49,50 but these subjects were pretreated
with an acute dose of cocaine49 or amphetamine.50 In contrast, our context manipulation did not
involve a pretreatment with acute cocaine. Rather, our results show
that mere re-exposure to an environment previously associated to cocaine
alters the amygdala peptide profile. We acknowledge that our results
represent a correlation between context re-exposure and peptide levels
and not causation. The implication may be that these amygdala peptides
are associated to subjective feelings related to expecting cocaine
when mice are placed in a cocaine-associated context. The peptides
may not cause the subjective feelings, but they may reflect the dynamic
neurochemical environment during the process of context re-exposure
and the expectation of drug reward.

In summary, we identified
peptide changes in the dentate gyrus
in an exercise-dependent manner and in the amygdala in a context-dependent
manner. Running decreased MBP derivatives in the dentate gyrus, possibly
reflecting increased unmyelinated neuron density. Exposure to a cocaine-context
increased several hemoglobin-derived peptides in the amygdala in runners
and an actin-derived peptide in sedentary animals. This is, to the
best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of peptide changes
in the amygdala in response to context re-exposure alone, as opposed
to drug pretreatment. Our findings identify novel molecular correlates
of both drug cue exposure and intervention to extinguish the learned
associations in two specific brain regions critical to the drug dependence
and relapse.

of male C57BL/6J mice, which arrived at our facility at 5 weeks of
age, from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Because the resources
available for housing, training, and testing for CPP limited the number
of animals per training set, the first cohort consisted of 48 mice,
the second cohort of 39.

Animals were housed four per cage in
a climate-controlled environment on a reverse 12 h light/dark cycle
(lights off at 1000 h) with food and water available ad libitum for
10 days. The cage dimensions were 29 × 19 × 13 cm3 (L × W × H). Mice were individually housed for 9 days before starting the experimental
procedures. All procedures were approved by the University of Illinois
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and adhered to NIH guidelines;
measures were taken to minimize the number of animals used and their
pain and suffering.

CPP Testing and Context Re-exposure
The experimental
design for the CPP training, testing, and re-exposure is presented
graphically in Figure 1A. CPP training and testing were adapted from Cunningham et al.9,51,52 and performed using chambers
with interchangeable floor textures, as described in previous studies.9,51,52 Cocaine hydrochloride was dissolved
in 0.9% saline and administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg via intraperitoneal
(ip) injections in a volume of 10 mL/kg. The dose was chosen based
on the literature and prepared according to the salt (not the base)
form.53 Prior to conditioning, mice underwent
habituation to familiarize them with the place conditioning chambers,
and pretesting to determine individual biases in texture preference
prior to drug pairing.

In the conditioning phase, conditioned
stimulus (CS) trials were administered over 4 days, as follows: four
CS+ trials (i.e., cocaine paired with one floor texture:
HOLE or GRID) and four CS− trials (i.e., vehicle
(saline), paired with the alternate floor texture). Experimental animals
were weighed, received an injection of 10 mg/kg ip cocaine (CS+ trial) or vehicle (CS– trial), and were
immediately placed on the appropriate floor texture. Each day, one
CS+ trial and one CS– trial were administered
in the morning and afternoon. The order of exposure to CS+ and CS– was counterbalanced within each group.

Following conditioning, the mice were placed individually in cages,
either with or without running wheels, to create two groups: runner
mice (housed with a running wheel, n = 24 in cohort
1, n = 19 in cohort 2) and sedentary mice (housed
without a running wheel, n = 24 in cohort 1, n = 20 in cohort 2). The dimensions of the running wheel
cages were 36 × 20 × 14 cm3 (L × W × H), with a 23
cm diameter wheel mounted in the cage top. Running wheel rotations
were monitored continuously in 1 min increments via magnetic switches
interfaced to a computer. Mice assigned to the sedentary group were
housed in cages that did not contain locked wheels because mice will
climb them,54−56 and the objective was to keep random physical activity
in the sedentary group to a minimum.

After 30 days of either
running or sedentary conditions, all of
the mice were tested for CPP in the morning (10:00 h) for 30 min.
Prior to the testing session, each mouse was weighed, injected ip
with 10 mL/kg saline, and placed in the center of a dual floor texture
(HOLE/GRID) conditioning chamber. The distance traveled and locations
of mice within the conditioning chamber were recorded with TOPSCAN
video tracking software (Clever Sys, Vienna, VA).

The day after
CPP testing, animals underwent one re-exposure to
context session in the morning (10:00 h; for 30 min). Mice were either
re-exposed to the CPP texture they had been conditioned to associate
to cocaine (n = 24 in cohort 1, n = 18 in cohort 2) or the CPP texture they had been conditioned to
associate to vehicle (n = 24 in cohort 1, n = 21 in cohort 2). All animals were weighed, injected
ip with 10 mL/kg saline, and placed into the center of either a HOLE
or GRID conditioning chamber. All mice had, up to this point, received
identical treatment, including number of total cocaine-context exposures.
Mice were deliberately not placed in the dual-texture chamber at context
re-exposure to control the amount of time spent on the drug-associated
texture. Animals underwent context re-exposure on day 2 of CPP testing
because this was the time point where the two treatment groups were
most divergent in CPP in previous results.9 With the different context re-exposures, there were four behavioral
groups created. For the first cohort of mice, n =
11, sedentary control group (saline-context re-exposed); n = 12, sedentary experimental group (cocaine-context re-exposed); n = 13, runner control group (saline-context re-exposed);
and n = 12 runner experimental group (cocaine-context
re-exposed).

A second group of mice (n = 40)
was used to increase
the number of replicates for investigating the link between peptide
changes and the conditioned stimulus in the amygdala. The behavioral
groups for the second cohort of mice were n = 11,
sedentary control group (saline-context re-exposed); n = 9, sedentary experimental group (cocaine-context re-exposed); n = 9, runner control group (saline-context re-exposed);
and n = 10 runner experimental group (cocaine-context
re-exposed).

Tissue Sampling and Peptide Extraction
Immediately
following the 30 min context re-exposure session, mice were anesthetized
with 150 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (ip) and then perfused transcardially
with ice-cold saline for neuroprotection.57,58 The brain was carefully removed and immediately flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen for preservation and stored at −80 °C.
For brain region sampling, frozen brains were ice-mounted on a cryostat
(Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems Inc) platform and cut at −40
°C in 40 μm increments until relevant morphological landmarks
were observed. Frozen tissues from the bilateral basolateral amygdala
and the bilateral dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were isolated via
biopsy punches of 1.25 mm diameter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,
FL) with a customized plunger. Coordinates of the punches taken were
determined according to the mouse brain atlas59 and were from 0.94 to −1.94 bregma for the amygdala and −1.94
to −2.94 bregma for the hippocampus. Tissue samples from both
hemispheres of the amygdala and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were
collected and immediately placed into 0.25% acetic acid for peptide
extraction on ice. Acidic extractions have been shown as an effective
method for peptide analysis.60

MALDI MS Peptide
Profiling
Only the first cohort of
animals (n = 48) was used for the MALDI MS analysis.
Samples contained 5 μL of peptide extract mixed with 2 μL
of a 10 μM solution of an internal standard (acidic peptide
from Aplysia californica, MW 2960).
Next, 0.7 μL of the spiked sample was co-crystallized with 0.7
μL of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (13 mg/mL
in 60% acetonitrile (ACN)) on a gold-coated MALDI target (Bruker).
Samples were spotted as five technical replicates for each animal.
Positive ion mass spectra for each sample spot were acquired in the m/z 600–5000 range on an MALDI-time-of-flight
mass spectrometer (ultrafleXtreme, Bruker) in reflectron mode with
high-precision calibration. Spectra were acquired in an automated
fashion, sampling from the spot in a random walk manner, and utilized
dynamic termination, where data collection for a spot concluded when
two individual peptide signals reached a summed intensity of 1 ×
104, which was determined optimal according to the S/N,
signal intensity, and resolution for this sample type in pilot measurements.

Relative Quantitation with Stable Isotopic Labeling and LC–MS
Detection
For the dentate gyrus, one cohort described in
the behavior section was used (n = 48). Two cohorts
of animals were used for relative quantitation with stable isotopic
labeling and LC–MS of amygdala samples (n =
48 first cohort plus n = 39 second cohort, n = 87 total) because individual samples needed to be pooled
to produce sufficient material for analysis. Pooled samples were created
by combining the unused portions (from MALDI MS) of the individual
extracts from three animals that had undergone identical treatment
(e.g., runner mice re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context). For
measurements from the dentate gyrus, pooled samples (n = 3) were created for each of the behavioral groups: sedentary mice
re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context, sedentary mice re-exposed
to the vehicle-paired context, runner mice re-exposed to the cocaine-paired
context, and runner mice re-exposed to the control context. For the
amygdala measurements, six pooled samples per treatment group (sedentary
or runner) and context re-exposure (cocaine-paired context or vehicle-paired
context) were created. Peptides in the pooled samples were covalently
modified with H4- or D4-SA for relative quantitation,
following the procedure described in Hou et al.61

For the dentate gyrus analysis, the samples were
labeled and combined as follows: extracts from sedentary animals re-exposed
to the cocaine-paired context (light) with extracts from runner animals
re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context (heavy), and extracts from
runner animals re-exposed to the control context (light) with extracts
from sedentary animals re-exposed to the control context (heavy).
For measurements for the amygdala extracts, the comparisons of context
re-exposure were performed with both the sedentary and runner groups.
The samples were labeled and combined as follows: sedentary mice re-exposed
to the cocaine-paired context (H4-SA) with sedentary mice
re-exposed to the vehicle-paired context (D4-SA), and runner
mice re-exposed to the cocaine-paired context (H4-SA) with
runner mice re-exposed to the control context (D4-SA).
The samples set aside for peptide identification were also labeled
with H4-SA.

Each of the labeled samples was loaded
as a 1 μL sample onto
a trap column (200 μm i.d. × 20 mm length, Acclaim Pepmap
C18 100, 5 μm, 100 Å; Thermo Scientific, Rockwood, TN)
at 20 μL/min with an Ultimate 3000 nanoHPLC system (Dionex,
Sunnyvale, CA). After switching the trap in-line with a reversed phase
C18 column (100 μm i.d. × 15 cm length, Magic C18, 3 μm,
200 Å; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA), analytical separation
was performed at 300 nL/min. The solvents used were H2O
with 0.1% formic acid (FA) for solvent A and 20/80 H2O/ACN
with 0.1% FA for solvent B. The multistep gradient used was 0–10
min, 4–25% B; 10–20 min, 25–30% B; 20–50
min, 30–60% B; 50–55 min, 60–75% B; 55–59
min, 75–90% B; 59–69 min, 90% B; 69 min 90–20%
B; 69–73 min 20–4% B; 73–115 min 4% B. Eluting
peptides were analyzed in MS mode on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass
spectrometer (Impact HD, Bruker) with the CaptiveSpray source (Bruker).
MS spectra were collected for an m/z range of 290–3000. Each sample was analyzed twice in MS mode
for two technical replicates per sample.

Peptide Identification
with LC–MS
Subsets of
peptide extracts from each cohort (n = 12 and 3)
were combined (without regard to treatment group) into samples for
peptide sequencing by MS/MS. For peptide identification, the platform
and chromatographic parameters utilized were the same as the peptide
quantitation measurements. The MS/MS precursor ion selection was set
for the three ions of highest intensity per MS scan, and active exclusion
of previously fragmented ions after 1 min was enabled. MS and MS/MS
spectra were collected for an m/z range of 290–3000. After data collection, the MS/MS spectra
were exported as an .mzXML file and searched against an in-house mouse
neuropeptide database and the whole mouse proteome downloaded from
UniProtKB62 using PEAKS Studio 7 (Bioinformatics
Solutions, Inc. Waterloo, ON, Canada). The search parameters used
in the software were as follows: no enzyme, variable post-translational
modifications (N-terminal pyro-Glu, acetylation, C-terminal amidation,
methylation, oxidation of methionine, and the addition of light or
heavy SA), mass tolerance of 0.1 Da for the precursor ion, and 0.1
Da for fragment ions. Peptide assignments were judged on the −10 log P score (>20) and mass error <100 ppm.

Statistical
Analysis
The average level of running across
all mice housed with running wheels (n = 46) was
analyzed as a repeated measures experiment, accounting for the effects
of cohort, day, and the interaction between cohort and day. For the
CPP test, the time spent on the HOLE texture was modeled with cohort,
exercise (runner or sedentary), context (cocaine-paired context or
vehicle-paired context), the interaction between cohort and exercise,
the interaction between cohort, and context and the interaction between
exercise and context. Both analyses were conducted with SAS (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC).

With the MALDI MS peptide profiles, the raw
spectra were imported into ClinProTools 2.2 software (Bruker), normalized
to the total ion count, smoothed and deisotoped using the Savitzky–Golay
algorithm at a width of 1.0 m/z over
four cycles. The Quick Classifier algorithm in ClinProTools was then
used to select putative candidate ion signals likely to differ significantly
between treatment groups. Ion signals considered for statistical analysis
were restricted to a S/N of 3:1. Intensity values of putative candidate
peptide signals were normalized relative to the intensity of the internal
standard observed in the individual sample. If the internal standard
was not detected in a sample, it was omitted from the analysis. The
normalized intensities for each putative candidate peptide were modeled
using ClinProTools for the effects of exercise (runner or sedentary),
context at re-exposure (cocaine-paired context or vehicle-paired context),
and the iteration (i.e., sample spot) was a within-subject variable
(five per mouse).

With the isotopically labeled samples analyzed
by LC–MS,
labeled peptide pairs were selected based on their charge, retention
time, and mass match (Figure 4A). After detecting a labeled pair at a particular time point
in the total ion chromatogram, extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) were
created for the monoisotopic ion of the light and heavy species (Figure 4B). The signals in
the EIC were integrated to create a combined mass spectrum that was
used for quantification. For each peptide, quantitative information
was obtained by summing the intensity of the first four isotopes in
the spectrum for the light and heavy forms. The summed intensities
were then log2 transformed, and the difference between
light and heavy forms was used to calculate fold changes. Fold changes
were averaged between technical replicates and were compared across
the biological samples accounting for context at re-exposure (cocaine-paired
context or vehicle-paired context) using SAS. Student’s t-tests were used to determine which ion signals showed
fold changes significantly different from zero. Adjustment for multiple
hypothesis testing was controlled by applying the Benjamini–Hochberg
FDR correction.63 FDRs were computed for
the set of peptides that were observed in all analyses.
