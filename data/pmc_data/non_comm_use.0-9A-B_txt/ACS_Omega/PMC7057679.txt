Developing green 3D porous materials
integrating multitasking environmental
remediation with high efficiency and reusability is considered to
be a promising sustainable approach and is urgently required. Herein,
we have successfully prepared a facile, ecofriendly, and robust multifunctional
composite sponge of carbon nitride (CN) nanosheets wrapping an elastomer
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) skeleton without harsh treatments. The
composite sponge (CN@PDMS) exhibits excellent hydrophobic and superoleophilic
properties with a water contact angle of 133.2°. This sponge
also shows high selective absorption of organic solvents and oils
with high recyclability after 10 absorption cycles. Furthermore, the
CN@PDMS sponge has a high ability for demulsification of the oil-in-water
emulsion as well. The as-prepared sponge displays high thermal stability,
retaining 82.16% of its original weight up to 550 °C, and extraordinary
prolonged stability in harsh corrosive solutions over 35 h compared
with the pristine PDMS sponge. Additionally, the CN@PDMS sponge exhibits
a high ability for adsorption and photodegradation of rhodamine B
under visible light irradiation with self-cleaning and high reusability
over 5 runs. Such a sustainable strategy would provide new ways for
broad environmental applications.

Introduction
With the rapid pace
of industrialization and maritime transport
growth, water pollution has become one of the major environmental
problems around the world.1−3 This has occurred through leaking
of pollutants into the water either by accident or deliberately including
petroleum products, dyes, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and so on.4 Among these organic pollutants, oily wastewater
is highly prevalent and contains harmful chemicals, which causes deterioration
side effect on aquatic lives and human health itself.5 On the other hand, the dissolved organic pollutants such
as the synthetic dyes are nonbiodegradable, persistent in the environment,
and recalcitrant to degradation and have usually mutagenic effects
on the aquatic lives.6,7 Recently, numerous efforts have
been devoted to develop advanced techniques for removal of oily wastewater
including filtration, precipitation, absorption, bioremediation, combustion,
and so forth.8,9 However, in addition to the high
costs and complicated processes, these techniques suffer from the
degradation ability for dissolved organic pollutants in the water
matrix. From a practical standpoint of water treatment, the development
of a multifunctional material dealing with the aforementioned pollutants
is highly desired.

The recent decade has witnessed an increasing
amount of research
interest with regard to fabrication of 3D porous polymers because
of their high porosity, open-celled morphology, flexibility, and ease
to modify.10,11 Of these, polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) sponge, a highly transparent and hydrophobic silicone polymer,
has been widely used in various fields owing to its extraordinary
properties, such as biocompatibility, low cost, thermal stability,
low density, high porosity, and good elasticity.12−15 Since the first successful fabrication
of the PDMS sponge via a sacrificial sugar templating method,16 the PDMS sponge has been immensely developed
for diverse environmental and energy applications, including oil/water
separation, catalysis, sensor, and energy harvesting and conversion.17,18 For enhancing oil/water separation, Tran et al. developed a robust
and eco-friendly graphene/PDMS composite sponge by embedding graphene
sheets in the PDMS sponge structure.19 The
composite sponge showed a highly efficient absorption performance
for different oils and organic solvents in different oil/water mixtures.
Gupta and Kulkarni synthesized gold nanoparticle–PDMS nanocomposite
foam.20 The prepared foam exhibited the
ability for absorption of diesel and odorous sulfur-containing contaminants
from water with high thermal and chemical stability. As a photocatalyst,
TiO2–PDMS composite sponge was developed via a simple
injection process of commercial TiO2 anatase onto the PDMS
sponge. The composite sponge showed high adsorption and photocatalytic
performance for rhodamine B (RhB) under solar irradiation.21 However, the applicability of previous reports
would be limited because of the obstacles accompanied with the intricate
synthesis process, utilization of harsh solvents, high cost, or low
efficiency. Thus, green fabrication of nanoparticle–PDMS composite
sponge with multifunctional applications and robust properties is
highly anticipated.

Recently, carbon nitride (CN), a 2D metal-free
polymeric and sustainable
semiconductor, has attracted intensive attention in the field of photocatalysis.
It possesses various fascinating features, such as low cost, high
chemical and thermal stability, unique electronic properties, and
highly efficient visible light response with an appropriate band gap.22−25 These merits endow CN with widespread applications in water splitting,
CO2 conversion, photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants,
and disinfection.26−28 However, the photocatalytic efficiency of bulk CN
is still limited because of the low specific surface area and the
high recombination rate of the photogenerated charge carriers, which
hinder its large-scale applications.29,30 To address
these limitations, various strategies have been developed, including
doping with metallic or nonmetallic elements, coupling with inorganic
semiconductors, and nanostructure engineering.31,32 Among these approaches, ultrathin fabrication of 2D nanosheets has
drawn much attention owing to their high surface area, abundant active
sites, excellent charge transfer, and significant inhibition of the
recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Thus, the photocatalytic
activity of these materials is significantly enhanced under visible
light irradiation.33,34 However, CN 2D nanosheets still
suffer from poor chemical and structural stability during the photocatalytic
process in the field application. To overcome these weaknesses, the
photocatalysts could be immobilized onto the 3D insoluble porous materials
which provide more active sites and large contact surface area with
the pollutants, prevent stacking or aggregation of nanosheets, and
make them ease to handle and reusable for prolonged times.

For
the aforementioned merits, the PDMS sponge offers an ideal
3D porous candidate for immobilization of CN nanosheets and fabrication
of the heterogeneous composite system for multifunctional applications.
In this work, we present the fabrication of multifunctional CN nanosheets
anchored on a PDMS sponge skeleton via a facile and eco-friendly approach.
The morphologies, properties, and chemical structures of the as-prepared
sponges were characterized, and the thermal and chemical stability
of the as-fabricated sponges were also investigated. The synthesized
CN@PDMS sponge was tested for oil/water separation and demulsification
of an oil-in-water emulsion. Afterward, the photocatalytic performance
and regeneration of the composite sponge were evaluated with the RhB
degradation under visible light irradiation. The findings in this
study elucidate that this novel composite sponge has the potential
for broad wastewater treatment applications.

Results and Discussion
Fabrication
and Characterization of As-Prepared Sponges
The schematic
fabrication of the pristine and composite sponges is
illuminated in Figure 1. The pristine sponge was fabricated using the sugar templating method,
whereas ultrathin CN nanosheets with enriched active sites were synthesized
by a green and facile approach in the wet atmosphere. This strategy
depends on the coupling of melem segment polymerization at high temperature
and delamination of condensed layers with water molecules entirely
in one-pot without any other additives.35 The as-synthesized CN appears as a foam-like white powder with high
specific surface area (96 m2 g–1). The
composite sponge was fabricated via a simple injection process and
thermal annealing at 200 °C to remove the adsorbed water and
enhance the attachment between the nanosheets and the PDMS surface.
After annealing, the composite sponge appeared off-white, retaining
its elastomer properties.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the green synthetic
process of CN nanosheets
and CN@PDMS sponge.

The morphological structure
of the as-prepared sponges was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Figure 2a, the SEM image of the PDMS
sponge demonstrates a 3D interconnected porous framework with an average
pore size of 150 μm. The high magnification view of Figure 2b,c reveals that
the pristine PDMS sponge has a very smooth surface. For the CN@PDMS
sponge, the SEM images clarify the stability of wrapped CN nanosheets
on the sponge surface after thermal annealing and rinsing with ethanol
and show the uniform coating of nanosheets on the sponge skeleton
with roughness structure (Figure 2e–g). Furthermore, the composite sponge after
the thermal annealing exhibits excellent compliance and springiness
after manual compression and it can perfectly retrieve its original
shape without breaking apart (Figure S1).

EDS of the pristine and the composite sponges, respectively; inside
tables are the related elemental analysis for the as-synthesized sponges.

To confirm the elemental composition of the pristine
and coated
PDMS sponges, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and elemental
analysis were conducted. As described in Figure 2d, The EDS analysis shows that the pristine
sponge comprises Si, C, O, and traces of nitrogen (nitrogen traces
may be residues from the sugar template), which are basic elements
in the PDMS polymer. On the other hand, the amount of C, N, and O
increases in the CN@PDMS sponge, confirming the introduction of CN
nanosheets on the surface of PDMS sponge (Figure 2h). The elemental mapping images manifest
the distribution of even elements on the surface of the pristine and
coated sponges, as illustrated in Figure 3, further clarifying the good distribution
of CN nanosheets on the sponge surface.

of (a) PDMS sponge and (b) CN@PDMS sponge
for C, N, O, and Si elements.

To investigate the active groups in the as-fabricated materials,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis was carried out,
and the spectra of melem and CN nanosheets are shown in Figure S2. For melem, there are 3 distinguished
peaks at 1612, 1467, and 803 cm–1, which ascribe
to the characteristic absorption of melem.36−38 Furthermore,
the broad band centered at 3129 cm–1 is related
to uncondensed terminal amino groups. The characteristic peaks of
CN nanosheets confirm the formation of CN with enriched active sites.
The peak at 810 cm–1 refers to bending vibration
of triazine rings. The intensive band between 1200 and 1638 cm–1 regions is attributed to typical stretching vibration
modes of either bridging (−C–NH–C−) or
trigonal N–(C3) in the s-triazine
heterocyclic ring (C6N7) units. Furthermore,
the broad band between 2900 and 3600 cm–1 indicates
the enriched active edges of −NH and −OH stretching.
For the PDMS sponge, the broad band centered at 1007 cm–1 is assigned to −Si–O–Si– stretching
vibration (Figure 4a), whereas the peak at 2962 and 1257 cm–1 and
band centered at 786 cm–1 are referred to symmetric
bending of the methyl groups (−CH3) in Si–C
bonds.39,40 For the CN@PDMS sponge, a new broad band
appears between 1287 and 1705 cm–1 (the black dashed
rectangle), referring to the successful introduction of tri-s-triazine heterocyclic ring units on the surface of the
sponge (Figure 4a).
Furthermore, a new observed band between 3014 and 3376 cm–1 (the red dashed rectangle) is attributed to terminal active groups
on the CN polymer, asserting the activation of the composite sponge
surface by the active sites. However, this band is rather weak probably
because of the elimination of most hydroxyl groups after annealing
at 200 °C or attaching with the oxygen molecules in the PDMS
polymer via hydrogen bonds.

Figure 4 (a) FTIR spectra and (b) thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) of the
pristine and composite PDMS sponges.

TGA was conducted to examine the stability and regeneration of
the as-synthesized sponges. As illustrated in Figure 4b, the PDMS sponge is stable until 220 °C
and then shows a gradual decomposition rate up to 420 °C. This
weight loss may be due to the depolymerization of PDMS chains to volatile
oligomers.41 In contrast, the CN@PDMS sponge
shows high thermal stability up to 420 °C without an observed
decline. Furthermore, 43.89% of the PDMS sponge weight is lost (black
and red arrows) at 550 °C, whereas merely 17.84% of the CN@PDMS
sponge weight is decomposed (black arrow). The CN@PDMS sponge exhibits
a much broader thermal stability compared with the gold nanoparticle–PDMS
nanocomposite foam (Au–PDMS) as reported before.20 The thermal stability of Au–PDMS foam
sharply decomposed at 506 °C with a total weight loss of 71%.
The total weight loss for the CN@PDMS sponge (57.87%) is lower than
that of the pristine sponge (62.23%) at 800 °C, confirming the
ability of CN nanosheets to improve the thermal stability of PDMS
sponge at high temperatures because of the inherent thermal stability
of the heptazine-based CN polymer.42

Oil Absorption and Oil-in-Water Emulsion Separation
To investigate
the absorption capacities of synthesized sponges,
various kinds of organic solvents and oils were employed and the as-prepared
sponge was immersed in the solution for a minute. During this period,
both of the pristine and composite sponges were quickly wetted and
swelled by the oil and no dripping of the absorbed oil was observed
after the handling process. Then, the absorption capacity was calculated
using the weight percentage (wt %) of the absorbed oil weight to the
own weight of the sponge. As shown in Figure 5a, the absorption capacities of the pristine
and composite sponges are almost close and ranged between 170 and
864 wt %. This range is in accordance with the as-fabricated PDMS/graphene
composite sponge with the range from 220 to 800 wt %.19 The insignificant change in the absorption capacity between
the pristine and composite sponges may be attributed to the fact that
the CN nanosheets’ thin layer coated on the PDMS surface does
not affect the porosity of the composite sponge. As can be seen in
the inset of Figure 5a, a water droplet can stand freely on the surface of the CN@PDMS
sponge with a high contact angle (133.2°), whereas the oil droplet
can absolutely wet its surface, affirming the excellent hydrophobic
and superoleophilic properties of the composite sponge. On the other
hand, the pristine PDMS sponge exhibits lower wettability with a contact
angle of 116.3°.

Figure 5 (a) Absorption capacity of the as-synthesized sponges;
insets show
water and n-hexane droplets colored with methylene
blue and Sudan red, respectively, and the contact angle of a water
drop (133.2°) on the surface of the CN@PDMS sponge. (b) 10 cycles
of testing the n-hexane and chloroform absorption
capacities using the composite sponge.

The recyclability of the CN@PDMS sponge is crucial to its widespread
application. As lighter and heavier solvents than water, n-hexane and chloroform were selected to test the reusability, respectively.
As shown in Figure 5b, the CN@PDMS sponge exhibits excellent reusability performance
over 10 times with no observed change in the absorption capacity.
Furthermore, the absorbent sponge could be recycled again via simple
squeezing, washing with ethanol, and finally drying in the oven because
of its intrinsic elastic nature. In spite of the swellable property
of the CN@PDMS sponge during the absorption and recyclability tests,
the morphology of the composite sponge after 10 absorption runs of n-hexane and chloroform shows high stability of CN nanosheets
on the PDMS skeleton (Figure S3). The high
fixability of the CN nanosheets on the PDMS surface may be attributed
to their intrinsic hydrophobicity which makes them attach well with
the terminal hydrophobic parts of the PDMS chain. Moreover, the enriched
CN edges with active groups such as amino and hydroxyl groups may
play another role for enhancing the fixability via the adsorption
with oxygen molecules in the (−O–Si–O−)
repeated units through hydrogen bonds.

It is of great importance
to test the prepared sponges under a
harsh condition taking into account the complex practical environments.
Prolonged exposure of the pristine and composite sponges for corrosive
aqueous liquids (2 M HCl, 2 M NaOH and saturated NaCl) has been investigated,
as exhibited in Figure 6. After immersing the as-synthesized sponges in the strongly acidic
and alkaline solutions, the wettability of the PDMS sponge is decreased
to approximately 95° after 35 h. To understand the wettability
changing of the PDMS sponge after acidic and basic treatment, the
FTIR spectral analysis was conducted (Figure S4). At an absorption peak of 3440 cm–1 (Figure S4b), the peak intensity of NaOH treatment
is stronger than that of the pristine sponge, which confirms the effect
of alkaline corrosion on the etching of the PDMS surface with introducing
more hydroxyl groups. In addition to the alkaline etching, HCl also
has a distortion effect on the PDMS surface after 35 h. This is affirmed
by the decline of symmetric bending peaks of the methyl groups in
Si–C at 1257 and 2962 cm–1 (Figure S4c,d). The corrosive effects of the acidic and alkaline
treatment were further established via SEM images (Figure S5). In contrast to its smooth surface, the PDMS surface
morphologies change significantly after the treatment, retaining its
skeleton unchanged. The SEM images confirm the etching effect on the
surface of PDMS with sinuous and roughness morphology and dense pitting.
These results have also been observed by Zhang et al. after treating
the PDMS sponge with 5 M NaOH for 6 h at 80 °C.43 On the other hand, the CN@PDMS sponge shows outstanding
stability over 35 h after acidic and alkaline treatment, maintaining
the contact angle for about 120°. This stresses that CN does
not only enhance the wettability and thermal stability of the PDMS
sponge but also improve the chemical stability for prolonged times.
The enhanced chemical stability is owing to the strong bonding between
conjugated tri-s-triazine polymers, which far protects
the surface of PDMS from wettability changing. The stability of CN
nanosheets on the surface of the PDMS polymer during the prolonged
harsh treatment is confirmed by SEM images as illustrated in Figure S6. Additionally, the FTIR spectra further
emphasize that the PDMS sponge still retains its activation surface
via anchoring of CN nanosheets on its surface (Figure S7). In a neutral medium, the PDMS and CN@PDMS sponges
show excellent stability and the contact angles remain unaltered with
no obvious decline in the contact angle after 24 h (Figure 6c).

Figure 6 Water contact angles
after immersing the pristine and composite
sponges at various times in the harsh conditions: (a) 2 M HCl, (b)
2 M NaOH, and (c) saturated NaCl.

To test the potential of the CN@PDMS sponge for selective absorption
of oils from water, a piece of the composite sponge was immersed in
the n-hexane/water mixture and the solvent was quickly
absorbed by the sponge and completely soaked up in 35 s as illustrated
in Figure 7a and Video S1. Also, the chloroform drops sunk at
the bottom of the water were immediately absorbed by the composite
sponge merely in 10 s as shown in Figure 7b and Video S2. Furthermore, the composite sponge exhibits high hydrophobic and
superoleophilic properties surrounding by trapped water bubbles (mirror-like
surface) and no water drops were absorbed (Figure 7b and Video S2).

Figure 7 Snapshots of the composite sponge (CN@PDMS) during absorption of
(a) n-hexane and (b) chloroform from water.

In addition to the oil/water immiscible mixtures,
oil-in-water
emulsions resulted from diffused surfactant stabilizers are widely
available in oily wastewater which requires high cost and complex
treatments.44 Here, we simulated the oil-in-water
emulsion using toluene as an oil and Tween 20 as an emulsifier in
water. The emulsion solution was still stable over 1 week, as seen
in Figure S8, and appears white milky color.
After immersing the composite sponge for 1 h, all the oil absorbed
and the solution became transparent. The oil-in-water emulsion separation
was confirmed by the optical microscopy images. As illustrated in Figure 8, the emulsion solution
comprises numerous toluene droplets and no droplet is observed after
adding the sponge. The ability of the composite sponge for demulsification
may be attributed to the excellent hydrophobic properties of the composite
sponge and further enhancement of the adsorption of toluene molecules
by active groups on the CN nanosheets. These findings offer clear
evidence that the CN@PDMS sponge provides a promising and clean approach
for highly efficient oily wastewater treatment.

Photocatalytic Performance
To investigate the adsorption
and photocatalytic activity of the CN@PDMS sponge toward azo dyes,
RhB is used as a model. For the pristine PDMS sponge, it is known
that the PDMS polymer has a high ability to adsorb small organic molecules
such as RhB through its nonpolar hydrophobic end.21 Here, the PDMS sponge shows good ability for adsorption
of RhB with an adsorption of 19.17% after 1 h and slightly increases
after another 1 h. For the CN@PDMS sponge, it shows a higher ability
to adsorb RhB than the pristine sponge in the absence of light irradiation
as illustrated in Figures 9a and S9, with an adsorption of
49.39% of RhB. The higher adsorption of RhB on the composite sponge
over the pristine sponge may be attributed to the activation of the
PDMS surface via enriched active groups of CN nanosheets. This finding
is also reported by Zhang et al. where they observed that the addition
of CN with graphene oxide (GO)-wrapped melamine sponge exhibited the
high adsorption capacity for RhB compared to the GO-wrapped sponge
and the pristine sponge.45

Figure 9 (a) Degradation efficiency
of RhB under visible light irradiation
with the pristine and composite sponges. (b) Recyclability of CN@PDMS
sponge for the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation.

After adsorption of RhB by the sponges in the dark,
the solution
is exposed to visible light irradiation for 1 h. The RhB solution
shows negligible photodegradation under irradiation. Also, the pristine
sponge does not show photodegradation activity, and the slight decline
after irradiation may be due to further adsorption of RhB on the surface
of the sponge. For the composite sponge, it exhibits a high photocatalytic
performance under visible light and 98% of RhB degrades after 45 min
and completely degrades after 1 h (Figure 9a). The high photocatalytic activity of the
composite sponge is achieved because of the unique structure of the
as-synthesized CN in the wet atmosphere with a high surface area and
enriched active sites. The CN@PDMS sponge shows higher RhB photodegradation
efficiency under visible light compared to the TiO2–PDMS
composite sponge where 80% of RhB was removed over TiO2–PDMS after overnight adsorption in the dark and then exposure
to solar irradiation for 1 h.21

The
reusability of the CN@PDMS sponge was also evaluated, and five
consecutive photocatalytic runs were measured. The composite sponge
displays extraordinary stability over 300 min adsorption in the dark
and 300 min visible light irradiation (Figure 9b). After five runs, the sponge retains its
high performance for RhB degradation with 96.5% efficiency, suggesting
excellent potentials for the field application. The stability of CN
nanosheets on the PDMS surface is asserted by the SEM image and FTIR
analysis, as shown in Figures S10 and S11, respectively.

This excellent regeneration is attributed to
the self-cleaning
property of the CN@PDMS sponge. After immersing the composite sponge
in the RhB solution for 1 h, it is exposed to visible light irradiation
for another 1 h without any solvent (Figure 10). After that, the composite sponge turns
visibly to its original appearance. By virtue of the enhanced photocatalytic
performance of CN nanosheets, these nanosheets on the sponge surface
endow it with the ability to degrade residues of the RhB molecules.
Such a self-cleaning feature under visible light promotes further
adsorption of RhB and bears it the recyclability several times with
the ease of regeneration.

Figure 10 Self-cleaning feature of CN@PDMS sponge after
adsorption of RhB
and exposing for 1 h under visible light irradiation.

The enhanced composite sponge surface can be explained with
UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectra, as shown in Figure S12. Obviously, the PDMS sponge exhibits only UV absorption
performance with an absorption edge of 322 nm, and the band gap accordingly
is calculated and shows a wide band gap (3.84 eV). After the introduction
of CN, the CN@PDMS sponge shows an enhanced visible light absorption
over the range of 450–700 nm with an absorption edge of 432
nm and the band gap subsequently decreases to 2.9 eV. Furthermore,
the XPS valence band (VB-XPS) spectrum of CN@PDMS was recorded to
deduce the valence band (VB) value to be 2.43 eV. Thus, the conduction
band (CB) is calculated to be −0.47 eV which is more negative
than that of the reduction potential of O2/•O2– (−0.28 eV).45

To elucidate the dominant reactive species generated
in the photocatalytic
process of RhB degradation, the trapping experiments were carried
out with the addition of p-benzoquinone (BQ, 1 mM),
isopropanol (IPA, 1 mM), and triethanolamine (TEOA, 1 mM), separately,
as scavengers for superoxide (•O2–), hydroxide (•OH), and holes (h+) radicals, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 11, the addition of TEOA and
BQ exhibits the higher inhibition of RhB photodegradation with a suppression
rate of 36.76 and 34.8%, respectively, whereas the addition of IPA
exhibits the lower suppression with a decline rate of 4.77%. These
findings confirm that the holes and •O2– radicals are the major reactive species in the
photocatalytic process.

Figure 11 Photocatalytic activity of the CN@PDMS sponge
for the degradation
of RhB in the presence of different scavengers.

On the basis of the abovementioned results, the possible mechanism
of RhB degradation is well-aligned with the adsorption of RhB on the
surface of the composite sponge. After absorption of photons from
the light source by the photocatalyst, the electron is excited from
the valence band to the CB and forms electron–hole pairs. The
excited electron has the ability to reduce the dissolved oxygen to
produce superoxide radicals which in turn degrade and mineralize the
RhB molecules. At the same time, the produced active holes as oxidizing
agents also participate in the photodegradation of RhB by means of
the oxidation process. Importantly, owing to its high transparency,
the PDMS polymer plays a key role in simulating the photocatalytic
process.18,46 The transparent PDMS sponge works as a light-absorbing
and -intensifying material and lets the incident light smoothly permeate
through it, whereby the photogenerated charge carriers are inducibly
produced and the photocatalytic activity is subsequently enhanced.
The overall reaction of the RhB photodegradation can be summarized
as in the following equations        

It is worth mentioning that there are two pathways for RhB
photodegradation
over the photocatalyst: N-deethylation and decomposition of the conjugated
xanthene ring in RhB.47,48 According to the UV–visible
spectra of RhB degradation over the composite sponge (Figure S9a), there is no a hypsochromic shift
during 30 min, indicating the high efficiency of the composite sponge
for destructing the xanthene ring and RhB mineralization. Afterward,
a slight blue hypsochromic shift is observed after 30 min, suggesting
the formation of N-deethylation species.49 Furthermore, in addition to the high adsorption feature of the PDMS
elastomer for RhB, the nucleophilic active sites on the CN edges may
play an important role in further enhancing the degradation of RhB
molecules. This enhanced degradation may occur via the electrostatic
attraction between the lone pairs of these groups and the cationic
part of RhB and through hydrogen bonds between carboxyl groups in
RhB and the active groups.

Conclusions
We
demonstrated a green fabrication of the CN nanosheet-doped PDMS
sponge skeleton via simple injection and annealing without tedious
or harsh conditions. The CN@PDMS sponge illustrated extraordinary
features including excellent thermal and chemical stability over harsh
corrosive conditions owing to the inherent fascinating durability
of CN nanosheets. The composite sponge showed fast and aloft selective
absorption of various oils from water, highly efficient oil-in-water
emulsion separation, and high reusability. Furthermore, the as-fabricated
sponge showed high adsorption and photocatalytic performance toward
RhB removal. Additionally, the prepared sponge showed high stability
and recyclability of RhB photodegradation with a self-cleaning feature
as well. These findings provide clear evidence that the CN@PDMS sponge
with such multifunctional and robust properties can be scaled up and
employed as a multitasking platform for broad environmental applications.

Fabrication of CN@PDMS Sponge
The synthesis of the
ultrathin CN nanosheets was fabricated as reported in our previous
report.35 Simply, melamine was condensed
to melem, and then, the fine melem powder was moved to the tube furnace
and heated to 550 °C for 4 h under the wet atmosphere. After
cooling to room temperature, the ultrathin foam-like CN nanosheets
were obtained. The preparation of PDMS sponge was achieved via the
conventional sugar templating method as in the previous reports.15,16 Briefly, 5 g of PDMS was mixed well with 0.5 g of the curing agent
(10:1 mass ratio) in a Petri dish, and then, the air trapped was degassed
under air vacuum until all bubbles were removed. Sugar cubes were
immersed in the polymer and then placed in a vacuum chamber to further
promote the diffusion of the polymer through sugar particles. After
curing at 100 °C for 2 h, the cubes were sonicated in a water
bath to remove the sugar particles and obtain the PDMS sponge. The
CN@PDMS sponge was fabricated by dispersing 50 mg of CN powder in
40 mL of IPA with ultrasonication for 30 min. The well-dispersed solution
was injected into the PDMS sponge using a syringe and then dried in
the oven at 60 °C for 1 h. Then, this process was repeated three
times to ensure the good dispersion of the nanosheets on the PDMS
skeleton. Finally, the composite sponge was annealed at 200 °C
for 2 h to enhance the hydrophobicity and adsorption of CN nanosheets
on the surface of PDMS. The composite sponge was rinsed thoroughly
with ethanol to remove the unanchored CN nanosheets and air-dried
overnight.

Characterization
The morphology
of the as-prepared
sponges was imaged using a scanning electron microscope (Phenom Pro).
Water contact angles were measured on a contact angle meter (OCA,
DataPhysics) at room temperature. FTIR spectra were recorded on a
Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). TGA was
conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere from 25 to 800 °C (TA TGA
Q5000), and elemental analysis was performed using an elemental analyzer
(Elementar Vario EL Cube). Energy dispersive spectra of the as-synthesized
sponges were recorded using an energy dispersive spectrometer (Bruker
QUANTAX).

Oil Absorption Capacity
The pristine and composite
PDMS sponges were cut to small pieces and used for testing oil absorption
capacity. The as-synthesized sponges were immersed in various oils
and organic solvents for about 1 min and quickly weighed to avoid
evaporation of the oil. The absorption capacity is calculated from
the following equation  where C0 is the
initial weight of the sponge and C is the weight
of the sponge after absorption.

Oil-in-Water Emulsion Separation
The oil-in-water emulsion
was formed by mixing water, toluene, and the emulsifier Tween 20 in
the mass ratio 99:1:0.05, respectively, and ultrasonicated for 15
min. After immersing the sponge in the emulsion for 1 h, the emulsified
oil drop removal was detected under an optical microscope (Shanghai
Cewei Photoelectric Technology).

Photocatalytic Test
The photodegradation of RhB as
a dye pollutant was evaluated under visible light irradiation. In
detail, one piece of the as-synthesized sponge (2 × 2 ×
1 cm3) was cut to pieces and immersed in 10 mL of RhB (10
mg L–1) in a quartz tube. Prior to the irradiation,
the sponge was allowed to come into contact with RhB solution in the
dark for a certain time to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium.
After that, the solution was irradiated using a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300C,
Perfect Light Limited, Beijing) with a 420 nm cutoff filter-provided
visible light irradiation, and the distance between the light source
and the sample was 12 cm. Aliquots of RhB solution were collected
every 15 min. The concentration changes of RhB were measured using
a UV–visible 6000 spectroscope at a wavelength of 554 nm.
