Glycomic-based approaches
to discover potential biomarkers have
shown great promise in their ability to distinguish between healthy
and diseased individuals; these methods can identify when aberrant
glycosylation is significant, but they cannot practically be adapted
into widely implemented diagnostic assays because they are too complex,
expensive, and low-throughput. We have developed a new strategy that
addresses challenges associated with sample preparation, sample throughput,
instrumentation needs, and data analysis to transfer the valuable
knowledge provided by protein glycosylation into a clinical environment.
Notably, the detection limits of the assay are in the single-digit
picomole range. Proof of principle is demonstrated by quantifying
the changes in the sialic acid content in fetuin. As the sialic acid
content in proteins varies in a number of disease states, this example
demonstrates the utility of the method for biomarker analysis. Furthermore,
the developed method can be adapted to other biologically important
saccharides, affording a broad array of quantitative glycomic analyses
that are accessible in a high-throughput, plate-reader format. These
studies enable glycomic-based biomarker discovery efforts to transition
through the difficult landscape of developing a potential biomarker
into a clinical assay.

Introduction
Protein glycosylation
is a prevalent post-translational modification
that is sensitive to changes in the cellular environment. Aberrant
protein glycosylation can be correlated to a number of diseases including
multiple types of cancer,1−3 Parkinson’s disease,4 and cardiovascular disease.5 Glycans represent a promising class of biomarkers that
can indicate diseases with high sensitivity and specificity; however,
current methods to analyze glycans are not well suited for the clinical
laboratory because of complex sample preparation needs.

In order
to quantify oligosaccharides, researchers typically conjugate
the reducing-end aldehyde with a fluorophore using reductive amination.2,6−8 Derivatization produces stoichiometrically labeled
saccharides whose relative molar quantities can be compared. However,
efficient fluorescent labeling via reductive amination requires high
excesses of fluorophore and other reagents that necessitate sample
cleanup. Cleanup can be performed by a variety of procedures, such
as solid-phase extraction or gel filtration,9 but these procedures increase the length and complexity of sample
preparation and decrease the throughput analysis.

Following
sample preparation, oligosaccharides can be separated
by liquid chromatography7 or capillary
electrophoresis.6 In-depth structural characterization
can be added with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis using either matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization6 or electrospray7,8 ionization. Structural identities can also be elucidated by comparison
to a reference database, although databases are specific to fluorophores
such as 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB)10 or 2-aminopyridine.11 These techniques can provide the necessary sensitivity
and low limits of detection needed to quantify potential glycan-based
biomarkers; however, the instrumentation needed is expensive, low-throughput,
and it requires expertise to operate and maintain. Therefore, this
instrumentation-heavy approach is not well suited for broad adoption
in clinical labs.

An additional disadvantage of the current
standard workflow for
glycomics analysis is the fact that the important glycomic features—such
as the amount of sialylation or fucosylation—are not quantifiable
in a single peak: the heterogeneous nature of protein glycosylation
splits the population of identical glycan features into multiple analytical
signals, increasing the complexity of data analysis. One elegant solution
to this problem is to simplify the analysis approach and prepare the
samples such that the glycan features of interest are detectable in
a single peak.12 Using a gas chromatography–MS-based
workflow, the released, derivatized monosaccharides that corresponded
to various glycan features—such as sialylated or fucosylated
glycans—were detectable in cancer patients and healthy controls,
demonstrating that this condensed glycan feature approach is capable
of differentiating between diseased and healthy populations with high
sensitivity and specificity.12 Saccharides
such as fucose and sialic acid have shown strong correlation to disease,13,14 but fluorescent-based quantitation fails to consolidate the populations
of these important species into a single analytical signal.

The current methods used to quantify protein glycosylation have
been invaluable in the field of biomarker discovery; translation to
usefulness in the clinical laboratory requires new, simplified methods
that reduce cost and complexity. Presented herein is a new method
to quantify protein glycosylation that simplifies the sample preparation,
instrumental analysis, and signal output. To obtain a single peak
corresponding to a particular glycan feature, saccharides are selectively
cleaved with a glycosidase that releases the glycan of interest. Next,
a standard fluorescent derivatization with 2-AB is used, and excess
fluorophore is removed in a rapid, automatable fashion through the
adaptation of a procedure first reported by Chu et al.15 Samples are transferred to a 384-well plate,
and the fluorescence intensity is rapidly measured, an approach more
conducive to high-throughput sample analysis than conventional glycan
profiling. The fluorescent signal is specific to the glycan cleaved
by the endoglycosidase or exoglycosidase used, allowing for the quantitation
of specific features in a simple signal output.

The usefulness
of the method is demonstrated by quantifying sialic
acid and demonstrating how small differences in glycosylation can
be identified in two proteins whose glycan profiles are very similar.
Sialic acid was chosen as the glycan for proof-of-concept demonstration
because of its immense importance in distinguishing disease states.
Indeed, sialylated glycoforms have already been implicated as biomarkers
for Parkinson’s disease,16 breast
cancer,17 and prostate cancer.18 In addition, the quantity of sialic acid in
haptoglobin is so disease-specific; measuring it may be an optimal
way to discriminate liver cancer from cirrhosis, the two conditions
that are known to be tough to tell apart.19

The method we developed to quantify sialic acid makes three
technological
advances that combine to produce a simple, high-throughput glycomics
assay. (1) Glycan specificity is controlled by the glycosidase used;
(2) derivatization cleanup is expedited using liquid/liquid extraction
instead of chromatography; (3) low detection limits and high throughput
are afforded by a plate-reader. This method reduces the analysis cost
and complexity; these benefits result in an assay that will allow
researchers to cross the difficult divide between glycan-based biomarker
discovery and clinical assay development, where throughput and simplicity
are paramount.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
Acetic acid, acetonitrile, 2-AB,
octanal, 5 M NaCNBH3 in 1 M NaOH, neuraminidase (sialidase)
from Clostridium perfringens, N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), fetuin, and asialofetuin
(from fetal calf serum) were purchased from MilliporeSigma (St. Louis,
MO), and 3 and 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) filters were
purchased from VWR (Radnor, PA).

Cleanup of 2-AB Labeling
Solution
A standard labeling
solution containing 10 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
1.4 μL of 5 M NaCNBH3 in 1 M NaOH, 5.6 μL of
500 mM 2-AB in acetonitrile, and 3 μL of acetic acid was diluted
to 220 μL with water. A reference blank was prepared using identical
volumes but using acetonitrile with no 2-AB in solution; all samples
and the reference blank were prepared in triplicate. Two octanal cleanup
procedures were compared. In the first procedure, 600 μL of
octanal was added to the samples; then, the samples were vortexed
for 1 min, rested for 1 min, and centrifuged for 1 min at 6400g. The octanal was discarded, taking care not to disturb
the aqueous layer, and three 50 μL aliquots of the aqueous layer
were transferred to a 384-microwell plate for fluorescent detection.
In the second, optimized, procedure, the extraction step with 600
μL was conducted twice. Then, 180 μL of the aqueous layer
was transferred to a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and 100 μL
of octanal was added to the samples, followed by vortexing for 1 min,
resting for 1 min, and centrifuging for 1 min at 6400g. Three 50 μL aliquots of the aqueous layer were transferred
to a 384-microwell plate for fluorescent detection.

2-AB-Derivatized
Sialic Acid Quantitation
A sialic
acid standard was diluted to various concentrations in PBS; 10 μL
of sialic acid was mixed with 1.4 μL of 5 M NaCNBH3 in 1 M NaOH, 5.6 μL of 500 mM 2-AB in acetonitrile, and 3
μL acetic acid. The samples were wrapped in parafilm and aluminum
foil and incubated for 16 h at 60 °C in a dry bath. Following
labeling, the solution was diluted to 220 μL with water and
transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. A volume of 600 μL of
octanal was added to the samples, and the samples were vortexed for
1 min, rested for 1 min, and centrifuged for 1 min at 6400g. Then, octanal was discarded, taking care not to disturb
the aqueous layer. A second aliquot of 600 μL of octanal was
added, and the extraction procedure was repeated. Next, 180 μL
of the aqueous layer was transferred to a clean 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube,
and 100 μL of octanal was added to the samples, followed by
vortexing for 1 min, resting for 1 min, and centrifuging for 1 min
at 6400g. Three 50 μL aliquots of the aqueous
layer were transferred to a 384-microwell plate for fluorescent detection.

Application to Sialic Acid Cleaved from Glycoproteins
Solutions
of fetuin and asialofetuin (1.5 mg/mL) were mixed in different
ratios (100% fetuin, 90% fetuin, 55% fetuin, 50% fetuin, and 100%
asialofetuin); 93 μL of these solutions and 5 μL of 0.2%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in PBS were incubated for 10 min at 100
°C to denature protein. The samples were allowed to cool, and
2 μL of neuraminidase (0.05 U/μL) was added. The samples
were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C to ensure complete deglycosylation
of the proteins. A sample containing 93 μL of water and 5 μL
of 0.2% SDS in PBS (without protein) was incubated with 2 μL
of sialidase as a negative control. The samples were loaded onto a
3 or 10 kDa MWCO filter and centrifuged at 12,000g for 30 min. The filtrate was immediately labeled with 2-AB or stored
at −20 °C. The samples were prepared in triplicate; the
labeling and cleanup conditions were identical to those used to quantify
the sialic acid standard for the initial application to the model
protein system. Specifically, 10 μL of the glycan solution was
labeled, as described above, and 50 μL of the 220 μL of
aqueous sample, after octanal extraction, was quantified, as described
above.

For the final comparison of the mixed protein samples
containing fetuin and asialofetuin, a slight modification to the procedure
was made to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the fluorescence
readout: following labeling, the samples were diluted to a volume
of 140 μL instead of 220 μL; after the second 600 μL
octanal addition was discarded, 120 μL was transferred instead
of 180 μL. After the third octanal extraction with 100 μL
of the solvent, a single 100 μL volume of the aqueous layer
was transferred to 384-well plates instead of three 50 μL volumes.
Five replicates of each protein mixture were prepared.

Fluorescent
Detection and Data Analysis
Readings were
taken on a SpectraMax iD3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San
Jose, CA). The read height was set to 1 mm, and the excitation and
emission wavelengths were 330 and 420 nm, respectively. Raw fluorescent
units (RFUs) are reported in the Results and Discussion section. To calculate the sialic acid content in the fetuin/asialofetuin
mixtures, the published value of 11 mol sialic acid/mol of protein20 was multiplied by the amount of fetuin in the
sample. The expected fluorescence response for sialic acid in fetuin
was found by multiplying the slope of the calibration curve for 2-AB-derivatized
sialic acid by the expected sialic acid content and adding the background
signal from asialofetuin.

Results and Discussion
We endeavored to solve a long-standing problem in the glycomics
field, facilitating the transition between glycan-based biomarker
discovery and clinical assay development. The key problem is the need
for technology that can quantify glycans selectively and at low detection
limits in a clinically viable, high-throughput assay. The field has
already achieved low detection limits for glycans using the attachment
of 2-AB to their reducing ends. Yet, these derivatized glycans are
typically quantified via an instrumentation-intensive platform [high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection.] Chromatography
has been required for two reasons: (1) to separate the labeled glycans
from the excess labeling reagent that is necessary to obtain efficient
labeling and (2) to provide specificity, as the glycans can be discriminated
based on their retention times. Moving away from a chromatographic
step would require addressing both of these needs. To address the
first, we adopted a new approach to remove excess 2-AB, based on a
recent work by Chu et al.15 The fluorophore
is rapidly removed by reacting and extracting it with octanal. A key
benefit to this method is that following cleanup, the labeled saccharides
remain in aqueous solution undiluted, eliminating the need for any
drying steps prior to quantitative analysis. Purified samples can
therefore be directly transferred to a plate reader for a fast, efficient
fluorescent reading. The data below show how implementing this extraction
method allows for a high-throughput readout. Afterward, we demonstrate
how assay specificity can also be addressed without relying on HPLC
or MS.

Rapid Cleanup of 2-AB-Labeled Glycans and Quantification on
a Plate Reader
The octanal reaction/extraction procedure
by Chu et al.15 was modified, so that it
could be implemented into a chromatography-free workflow. In the initial
report of using this extraction procedure, most of the unreacted 2-AB
was removed, but HPLC was still required for the complete removal
of the residual labeling reagent from the glycans. The purity requirements
for a chromatography-free workflow are inherently higher than the
previously described approach because the residual fluorophore would
introduce a higher background signal, impeding the detection and quantitation
of labeled glycans. To effectively adapt the octanal extraction method
for the experiment described herein, the procedure was modified, so
that substantially more residual 2-AB would be selectively removed
from solution, while keeping the labeled saccharides in solution and
recovering them with high efficiency. Three key aspects were important
during optimization: reducing the background, maximizing repeatability,
and minimizing solvent consumption.

Figure 1 shows how modifications to the original
octanal extraction procedure improve the removal of residual 2-AB. Figure 1A shows the residual
fluorescence intensity that is obtained from unremoved 2-AB, following
the original protocol in ref (15). In this case, the 2-AB labeling solution, containing no
saccharide, was vortexed with 600 μL of octanal; octanal was
discarded, and the fluorescence of the aqueous solution was measured.
The fluorescence intensity was 27 times higher than that of the blank
(Figure 1C) with a
significant standard deviation between analyses. The excess background
would significantly diminish the quantitative capability of our assay;
so, efforts were taken to identify the extraction conditions that
reduced the fluorescence intensity and increase its repeatability.
Optimized extraction conditions were as follows: two 600 μL
extractions followed by a 100 μL extraction. These conditions
produced the results as in Figure 1B; the background signal is reduced by a factor of
10 and the standard deviation is also smaller. (Note: reducing the
third extraction volume to 100 μL, instead of 600 μL,
reduced the waste generated and did not negatively impact either the
background or the repeatability.)

Figure 1 Optimization of the octanal cleanup procedure.
Fluorescence intensity
of 2-AB labeling solutions measured after: (A) one 600 μL octanal
extraction and (B) two 600 μL extractions followed by one 100
μL extraction. (C) Fluorescence intensity of a blank with no
2-AB. Background was considerably reduced using optimized washing
conditions (B). Samples were prepared in triplicate; each bar represents
one sample which was divided into three individual wells; error bars
represent the standard deviation of individual well measurements.

After the cleanup conditions were optimized, reaction
efficiency,
linearity, and the limit of detection were determined. To determine
the reaction efficiency, various concentrations of a sialic acid standard
were labeled with 2-AB, purified by octanal extraction, and quantified
by fluorescence. The fluorescence intensity of the derivatized glycans
was compared to the fluorescence intensity of pure 2-AB at the same
concentrations as that of the glycan standards. The results are shown
in Figure 2. The 2-AB
and 2-AB-derivatized sialic acids produced very similar fluorescence
intensity at each concentration. Surprisingly, the 2-AB-derivatized
glycans had a slightly higher signal at each point tested. This is
predominately because of a slightly higher background, as a blank
of the reductive amination solution following octanal cleanup had
a substantially higher signal than pure water. The slopes of the two
curves are almost identical (0.0197 vs 0.0184), indicating that the
change in fluorescence signal with the change in concentration is
consistent, for both the 2-AB tag by itself and the tagged, purified
glycan. These nearly identical slopes demonstrate that the reaction
proceeded to ∼100% completion, and the cleanup procedure did
not result in any measurable sample losses. The linearity of the calibration
curve was quite good, with an R2 value
of 0.999, and no decrease in linearity was observed compared to the
standard curve produced solely from 2-AB. The limit of quantitation
(LOQ) was 2.7 pmol/well for 2-AB (where no extraction is required)
and 8.8 pmol/well for 2-AB-derivatized sialic acid (where the samples
are extracted with octanal). The increase in LOQ for the derivatized
saccharide is the result of higher background standard deviation following
octanal extraction; the LOQ remains sufficiently low to quantify saccharides
in biologically relevant, low-abundant glycoproteins.

2-AB standard (⧫) and 2-AB-derivatized
sialic acid (■). The error bars, which are present at every
concentration point, are too small to see on some points.

Obtaining Glycan Specificity without HPLC or MS Detection
Current glycan quantitation methods typically require either HPLC
retention times or m/z’s
(from MS) to discriminate one type of glycan from another; a broadly
implementable approach would remove the need for this type of instrumentation.
We mitigate this problem by implementing highly specific glycosidases
into the workflow. In a proof-of-concept example, fetuin and asialofetuin
are treated with sialidase to demonstrate how the developed method
could be used to identify small, specific changes in protein glycosylation.
These proteins have identical sequences and contain three N-linked
glycosylation sites; the difference between the proteins is that fetuin
is heavily sialylated, containing approximately 11 mol sialic acid/mol
protein,20 whereas asialofetuin contains
no sialic acid; otherwise, the glycan components are identical. The
workflow used to prepare samples is shown in Figure 3. Fetuin and asialofetuin were incubated
with an enzyme that selectively releases sialic acid from N-glycans. Following enzymatic cleavage, the samples were
passed through a MWCO filter to separate the released glycans from
the protein. The filtrate, containing cleaved saccharides, was incubated
with 2-AB labeling solution. Following sample cleanup, the fluorescence
intensity was measured.

Figure 3 Experimental workflow to quantify sialic acids
in glycoproteins;
sialic acid (pink diamonds) is enzymatically cleaved from proteins
and then passed through an MWCO filter. The samples are then labeled
with 2-AB. Excess fluorophore is conjugated to octanal and removed
through the separation of the octanal (orange) and aqueous layers.
Aqueous solution is transferred to a microplate where the fluorescent
intensity is measured.

The effectiveness of
the workflow in Figure 3 can be seen in Figure 4A, which contains the quantitative results
obtained after subjecting fetuin and asialofetuin to the workflow.
When asialofetuin was subjected to this procedure, the fluorescence
intensity of the extracted glycans was approximately equivalent to
the signal contained for the negative control, where no protein other
than sialidase is present. The increase in fluorescence intensity
observed when fetuin is incubated with sialidase indicates that sialic
acid was successfully cleaved and derivatized. These data demonstrate
that the combination of a selective glycosidase, a careful derivatization
and cleanup procedure, and a fluorescent readout is sufficient to
detect and quantify cleaved saccharides of interest.

specificity, accuracy, and linearity for
glycoproteins. (A) Fluorescent intensity of cleaved sialic acid from
negative control, asialofetuin, and fetuin. (B) Calibration curve
for fetuin and asialofetuin mixed in different ratios: the fluorescent
intensity increases linearly with the sialylated fraction of the protein.
The dotted line shows the fluorescence intensity expected from the
calculated sialic acid content.

To verify that the inclusion of the glycosidase step did not deteriorate
the quantitative metrics of the overall assay, we built a new calibration
curve, by mixing fetuin and asialofetuin in different ratios and subjecting
the samples to the workflow; the results are shown in Figure 4B. The solid line shows the
measured fluorescent signal plotted against the percentage of fetuin
in the samples, producing a linear response with low intra- and intersample
variation. Importantly, an R2 value of
>0.99 was obtained, which demonstrates that every step of the procedure,
including glycan cleavage, labeling, residual labeling reagent removal,
and quantitation, can be performed with high repeatability and can
provide a linear response.

The accuracy of the assay is also
demonstrated; the dotted line
represents the fluorescence intensity values, calculated from the
2-AB-derivatized sialic acid calibration curve in Figure 2, that would be obtained if
exactly 11 mol of sialic acid was present per mole of fetuin—as
reported elsewhere20––and
no sample losses were experienced during glycan cleavage, derivatization,
or purification. An example calculation showing explicitly how the
values in this curve are calculated is provided in the Supporting Information. Clearly, the measured
values remain very close to the predicted ones, demonstrating that
the method is highly accurate and that sialic acid present in the
protein is effectively cleaved, labeled, and detected.

As a
final point of rigor, we verified that the assay maintains
its linearity throughout the range of concentrations and conditions
tested herein. The most concentrated sample shown in this work is
the sample in Figure 4B corresponding to 100% fetuin; it contained 720 pmol of sialic acid
per well, as described in the sample calculation (Supporting Information). A calibration curve for 2-AB from
100 to 1000 pmol/well is provided in Figure S1. The slope of this curve (0.0018 × 107 RFU/pmol)
is unchanged from the slope shown in Figure 2, which covers a range up to 200 pmol/well;
the assay does not suffer a drop in sensitivity in this higher concentration
range; this point is also confirmed by the highly linear nature of
the curve: R2 > 0.9999. Additionally,
when ∼9–90 pmol of fetuin is deglycosylated, generating
∼100–1000 pmol of sialic acid, the released, derivatized
glycans produce a highly linear response (R2 = 0.998), showing that even the deglycosylation and labeling steps
do not impact the linearity of the assay; see Figure S1.

Finally, we determined the extent to which
two samples with very
similar glycosylation profiles could be discriminated in this assay.
Five replicates of four different protein mixtures (containing fetuin
and asialofetuin) were prepared and assayed. The results are shown
in Figure 5. The mixtures
containing either 100% fetuin or 90% fetuin/10% asialofetuin could
be discriminated easily, at >99% confidence interval (p < 0.01). This result shows that when a protein’s glycosylation
changes by just 10%, this assay can detect it with certainty. Two
samples whose glycosylation was even more similar were also compared.
These samples had a difference in their sialic acid content of just
5%. Here, the samples were not quite differentiable at the 95% confidence
interval, with p = 0.0696. As the goal of this assay
is to develop a clinically relevant assay platform that can distinguish
substantial changes in glycosylation (typically greater than twofold
different), these metrics are quite appealing: biological variability
among patients in the same cohort would present a much larger variation
in glycosylation than the 5% measurement uncertainty determined here.

Figure 5 Demonstration
that the method is capable of measuring small changes
in glycosylation in proteins. (Left side): Protein sample containing
either 100% fetuin or 90% fetuin; 10% asialofetuin is readily discriminable.
Protein samples containing 55% fetuin or 50% fetuin are almost discriminable
at the 95% confidence interval.

Although only a single glycosidase example is needed to demonstrate
the proof of principle, this assay could be multiplexed. Other glycans
that can be cleaved with glycosidases could be used in parallel to
create a unique glycan fingerprint for patients; a depiction of this
vision can be seen in Figure 6. The relative abundances of different glycan features can
be compared to develop diagnostic tests that discriminate between
healthy and diseased individuals. The features could even be assessed
en masse using machine learning software, such as the recently described
Aristotle Classifier, which was specifically designed for discriminating
disease states using a panel of glycan features.21 The easy fluorescent quantitation of multiple glycan features
for patient samples, such as that described in Figure 6, could provide the means to identify highly
sensitive and specific biomarkers in a convenient clinical assay,
not requiring more instrument-heavy workflows. Additionally, biomarkers
identified in highly informative (MS-based or HPLC fluorescence-based)
glycomics experiments can be adapted to a clinically viable format
using the developed assay.

features used to create
a unique glycan fingerprint for individual patients.

Conclusions
Herein, we provide a solution for researchers
who have discovered
promising glycan-based biomarkers but need a viable assay for validating
their biomarkers on a large scale and transitioning the assay to the
clinic. The developed method provides characteristics that are needed
in clinically viable assays: incorporating glycosidases allows for
the quantification of glycan-specific features in the simple, fast
purification of derivatized saccharides with octanal increases in
sample throughput, and the use of a plate reader for quantifying the
fluorescence signal transforms a slow, technology-intensive assay
to one that is clinically viable. Combined, these features result
in an assay capable of reliably discriminating between small differences
in protein glycosylation in a rapid, high-throughput fashion. Proof
of concept was established by selectively detecting one particular
type of glycan, sialic acid, whose abundance is commonly modified
in disease states. The method successfully detected a glycosylation
change with just a 10% change in the sialic acid content of the protein
tested.
