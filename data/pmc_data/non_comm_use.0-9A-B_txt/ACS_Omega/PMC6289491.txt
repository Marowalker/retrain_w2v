Machine
learning methods have revolutionized modern science, providing
fast and accurate solutions to multiple problems. However, they are
commonly treated as “black boxes”. Therefore, in important
scientific fields such as medicinal chemistry and drug discovery,
machine learning methods are restricted almost exclusively to the
task of performing predictions of large and heterogeneous data sets
of chemicals. The lack of interpretability prevents the full exploitation
of the machine learning models as generators of new chemical knowledge.
This work focuses on the development of an ensemble learning model
for the prediction and design of potent dual heat shock protein 90
(Hsp90) inhibitors. The model displays accuracy higher than 80% in
both training and test sets. To use the ensemble model as a generator
of new chemical knowledge, three steps were followed. First, a physicochemical
and/or structural interpretation was provided for each molecular descriptor
present in the ensemble learning model. Second, the term “pseudolinear
equation” was introduced within the context of machine learning
to calculate the relative quantitative contributions of different
molecular fragments to the inhibitory activity against the two Hsp90
isoforms studied here. Finally, by assembling the fragments with positive
contributions, new molecules were designed, being predicted as potent
Hsp90 inhibitors. According to Lipinski’s rule of five, the
designed molecules were found to exhibit potentially good oral bioavailability,
a primordial property that chemicals must have to pass early stages
in drug discovery. The present approach based on the combination of
ensemble learning and fragment-based topological design holds great
promise in drug discovery, and it can be adapted and applied to many
different scientific disciplines.

1 Introduction
Machine
learning (ML) methods have revolutionized modern science,
providing deeper insights into the understanding of multiple phenomena
and generating plausible solutions to different problems. In medicinal
chemistry and drug discovery, ML methods have played an essential
role in areas such as data mining and virtual screening.1−3 However, with the use of ML methods, several issues emerge. From
one side, there is a tendency of the ML models to overfitting the
data, a detrimental property where the ML models unknowingly extract
certain residual information (i.e., the noise), assuming that such
information represents the underlying model structure. An accepted
solution to this situation (among some potential options that exist)
is to use ensemble learning, a process focused on generating multiple
ML models that are strategically combined to solve a particular problem
by providing a consensus response. It is also known that the models
based on ensemble learning can provide better prediction results than
single ML models.4−10

On the other hand, the greatest concern is that, to date,
the ML
models are frequently treated as black boxes regardless of the ML
method employed, the purpose for their creation, and the approaches
used to assess the reliability of the predictions. Consequently, this
prevents the use of the ML models as generators of new chemical knowledge
in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Some successful attempts
have been made in the sense of applying programming/codification approaches
and rules within the ML models, which allow the generation of new
chemical structures that are accurately predicted to exhibit desired
properties.11−14 However, it can take too much time to master the necessary programming
skills, and in the end, the lack of a phenomenological interpretation
in the ML models remains; most of the ML models are not capable of
providing an interpretation of the physicochemical and/or structural
features of the chemicals in the databases, which they intend to analyze
and predict.

In an attempt to solve all of the aforementioned
restrictions,
this work reports a multitarget ensemble learning model for quantitative
structure–activity relationships (mt-QSAR-EL), which is applied
in combination with a fragment-based topological approach for the
de novo design and prediction of inhibitors of the α and β
isoforms of the heat shock protein 90, namely, Hsp90α and Hsp90β,
respectively. These biomolecular targets have been used as cases of
study due to their direct implication in genetic and epigenetic variations,15 which are associated with high mortality causing
diseases such as cancers.16 Here, plausible
physicochemical/structural interpretations of the variables (molecular
descriptors) of the mt-QSAR-EL model are given. In addition, the term
“pseudolinear equation” is introduced within the context
of ML methods. By using this pseudolinear equation derived from the
mt-QSAR-EL model, the relative quantitative contributions of different
molecular fragments to the inhibitory activity against the Hsp90 isoforms
are calculated. It is shown that from the joint use of the fragments
with positive contributions and the physicochemical/structural interpretation
of the mt-QSAR-EL model, completely new molecules can be designed
as potentially dual Hsp90 inhibitors.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Mt-QSAR-EL Model
The mt-QSAR-EL model
was built by considering both sets of molecular descriptors. The notation
of the best mt-QSAR-EL model found is Output 5:[5]:1, meaning that
the ensemble model is composed of five molecular descriptors used
as inputs, five artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on the radial
basis function (RBF) architecture, and one output that is the predicted
value of the categorical variable of inhibitory activity [Pred_APi(bt)]. All of the chemical and
assay data used in this study are reported in the Supporting Information 1. The molecular descriptors used to
develop the mt-QSAR-EL model are reported in Table 1, including their corresponding definitions.

In terms of the internal quality and predictive power,
the mt-QSAR-EL
model exhibited accuracy [Ac(%)] values of 83.07
and 83.2% for the training and test sets, respectively. In Table 2, the statistics sensitivity
[Sn(%)] and specificity [Sp(%)]
define the percentages of correct classification for active and inactive
compounds, respectively. In this sense, both Sn(%)
and Sp(%) surpass the value of 80%, and therefore,
the mt-QSAR-EL model has a very good performance in classifying/predicting
active and inactive molecules. Also, the local counterparts of Sn(%) and Sp(%) were calculated. Such statistics
are [Sn(%)]bt and [Sp(%)]bt, and they depend only on those compounds assayed
against a specific Hsp90 isoform. According to the Supporting Information 2, these percentage-based statistics
display values in the interval 75–93% in the training set,
while in the test set, the range 76–90% is reported.

inactive; Sn(%): sensitivity expressed as the percentage
of molecules
correctly classified as active; Sp(%): specificity
expressed as the percentage of molecules correctly classified as inactive; MCC: Matthews correlation coefficient.

Finally, in Table 2, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is
higher than 0.66. This statistical index can have values from −1
(total divergence between prediction and observation) to 1 (perfect
prediction/classification), while 0 indicates the performance of a
random predictor. As the MCC values are closer to
1 than to 0, then it is fair to say that the MCC values
reported for the mt-QSAR-EL model reflect a strong correlation between
the observed and predicted values of the categorical variable of activity APi(bt).

In any computational model exhibiting potential
predictive capabilities,
it is very important to assess the reliability of the predictions.
In this sense, the applicability domain is a well-known concept, which
defines an interpolation region where a model is thought to perform
the most reliable predictions. Thus, many applicability domain approaches
have been reported in the scientific literature.17 In the present study, a consensus approach is used to exploit
the potentialities of the mt-QSAR-EL model in predicting chemicals.
Consensus approaches have also been studied, and in contrast to the
applicability domain concept, they can be used for both interpolation
and extrapolation.17 Here, a consensus
approach has been applied. The mt-QSAR-EL model is based on an ensemble
of ANNs, and when classifying/predicting chemicals, each ANN in the
ensemble gives a classification response, and then, the different
responses of the ANNs are combined to yield the final output classification.
At its essence, an ensemble of ANNs works very similarly to the ML
method known as random forests.17 In addition,
the applicability domain based on the descriptor space was assessed;
all of the chemicals whose values of their molecular descriptors fell
beyond the maximum and minimum values in the training set composed
of the compounds correctly classified by the mt-QSAR-EL model were
considered to be outside the applicability domain (Supporting Information 3). We note that the maximum and minimum
values of each molecular descriptor define the upper and lower boundaries
in the descriptor space. To provide a better explanation of the applicability
domain employed here, the information of the maximum and minimum values
of each molecular descriptor was used to calculate local scores. If
a defined descriptor value of a new molecule was between the aforementioned
boundaries, the local score took the value of 1; otherwise, the local
score took the value of 0. Consequently, for the mt-QSAR-EL model,
as it was constructed from five variables, the total score (sum of
the local scores) must have a value of 5 to ensure the complete agreement
with the applicability domain.

2.2 Physicochemical
Interpretation of the Molecular
Descriptors in the mt-QSAR-EL Model
Currently, most of the
chemoinformatic models (including those based on mt-QSAR approaches)
are focused on predicting large and heterogeneous databases of drugs/chemicals.
Consequently, the phenomenological information that the predictive
models may provide is often neglected and underestimated.18 Here, the different molecular descriptors present
in the mt-QSAR-EL model will be interpreted from a physicochemical
and/or structural point of view. Such interpretations will provide
deeper insights into the features that a molecule should have to inhibit
the two Hsp90 isoforms. While analyzing the different molecular descriptors
in a physicochemical/structural context, the interpretations will
be elucidated on the basis of their importance values SV (also known as sensitivity values), which are depicted in Figure 1. The higher the SV of a molecular descriptor, the greater will be its significance
in the mt-QSAR-EL model.

Figure 1 Relative importance of each molecular descriptor
in the mt-QSAR-EL
model.

To give a reasonable physicochemical/structural
interpretation
of the molecular descriptors, it is important to know how their values
should vary to increase the inhibitory activity against the Hsp90
isoforms. However, ML models are very difficult to interpret due to
their nonlinear nature. For this reason, Speck-Planche and co-workers
proposed an approach to interpret the molecular descriptors of an
ML model.19 This approach will be used
here to explain the information content of the molecular descriptors
present in the mt-QSAR-EL model. The approach focuses on the calculation
of the class-based mean values (Table 3), and it is applied only to those molecules in the
training set that were correctly predicted/classified. This indicates
that for each molecular descriptor, two mean values will be calculated,
one for the class of molecules annotated and correctly predicted as
active and the other for those molecules assigned and correctly predicted
as inactive.

in the mt-QSAR-EL Model Expressed through to the Class-Based Means

D[Xv(C)5]bt	2.388 × 10–3	–0.057	increase	
a Relative tendency indicates the
type of variation (increase or diminution) that a descriptor should
undergo.

As separated classes,
active and inactive molecules correctly predicted
by the mt-QSAR-EL model display different physicochemical properties
and structural characteristics, which will be reflected in some way
in the mean values of each molecular descriptor for each category/class.
The comparison between the mean values of the two classes for a defined
molecular descriptor permits to establish a tendency, indicating how
the physicochemical properties and the structural features should
be modified to improve the inhibitory potency against the Hsp90 isoforms.
Of course, such a tendency is relative due to the nonlinearity of
the mt-QSAR-EL model, but it is rigorous enough to ensure a correct
interpretation of the molecular descriptors.19

It should be noted that all of the molecular descriptors used
in
this work consider the bond order; the higher the value of this bond
property, the higher will be the values of these molecular descriptors.
There are two molecular descriptors with electronic information in
the mt-QSAR-EL model. One of them is D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt. Being the most
significant descriptor in the model, D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt characterizes
the diminution of the electronegativity of the atoms that are separated
at a topological distance equal to 3. This means that the electronegative
atoms should be dispersed throughout the entire molecule, preferably
at topological distances larger than 3. Substituted aromatic and aliphatic
rings and their corresponding heteroatom-based counterparts, as well
as linear and ramified aliphatic portions, can contribute to the diminution
of the aforementioned molecular descriptor. The other molecular descriptor
embodying electronic information is D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt, which indicates
the decrease of the electronegativity of the atoms that are separated
at a topological distance equal to 7. This descriptor has the second
highest importance in the mt-QSAR-EL, and its value can be diminished
by placing polysubstituted aromatic and heteroaromatic rings in the
periphery of the molecules, while aliphatic and heteroaliphatic portions
(rings included) should be placed between any two rings (if possible)
regardless of whether the rings are aromatic or aliphatic. In addition, D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt also considers the frequency with which the electronegative atoms
appear in the molecules at the topological distance equal to 7; the
lower the frequency of appearance of a defined electronegative atom,
the lower the value of D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt. It should be emphasized that
fused rings can contribute to the diminution of both D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt and D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt.

There are two other molecular descriptors, which account
for the
hydrophilic aspects of the molecules. In this sense, D[TmpAq0(PSA)_AM]bt describes the decrease of the total polar surface area. Therefore,
the number of atoms able to form hydrogen bonds should be diminished.
In convergence with D[TmpAq0(PSA)_AM]bt, the descriptor D[TmpAq3(PSA)_MX]bt also
characterizes the decrease of the polar surface area, but only in
regions where any two atoms are placed at a topological distance equal
to 3. Consequently, atoms able to form hydrogen bonds should be placed
at a topological distance different from 3. One should note that D[TmpAq0(PSA)_AM]bt and D[TmpAq3(PSA)_MX]bt contain information regarding the frequency of appearance
of specific types of atoms able to form hydrogen bonds; the lower
the frequency, the lower the values of both molecular descriptors.
It should be pointed out that D[TmpAq0(PSA)_AM]bt is the fourth most influent
descriptor in the mt-QSAR-EL model, while D[TmpAq3(PSA)_MX]bt has the lowest
significance.

Finally, D[Xv(C)5]bt is the third
most influent descriptor in the mt-QSAR-EL model. This descriptor
accounts for the steric factor known as molecular accessibility, which
defines the regions in a molecule that are available to interact with
the surrounding medium (in this case, the protein). More specifically, D[Xv(C)5]bt contains information regarding the
increment of the number of fragments composed of five bonds, where
each bond of the fragment act as a ramification. Consequently, in
all of the molecules containing regions that topologically resemble
2,3-dimethylbutane, the value of D[Xv(C)5]bt will increase.

2.3 Relative Quantitative Contributions
of the
Fragments to the Inhibitory Activity
When inhibiting a target,
a molecule acts as a whole. Nevertheless, due to their structural
characteristics and physicochemical properties, certain regions of
a molecule will be more suited than others to interact with the target
in an effective manner. Such regions or fragments will have a higher
influence in the interaction and consequently a higher contribution
to the inhibition against a target. Therefore, it is very important
to quantify how much a fragment can contribute to the inhibitory activity.

It has been established that any topological (graph-based) index
of a molecule can be represented as a linear combination of the frequency
with which diverse fragments (connected and disconnected) appear in
the molecule.20 Therefore, if we have a
linear QSAR equation (e.g., as those obtained from multiple linear
regression or linear discriminant analysis) involving several topological
indices, it is possible to calculate these indices for a fragment
of interest and substitute them in the linear equation, yielding an
activity score for the fragment. There are many examples in the scientific
literature that have employed this idea to calculate the quantitative
contributions of the molecular fragments to multiple biological effects,
such as activity, toxicity, and ADME properties.18,21−25 In this study, to calculate the quantitative contributions of the
different fragments to the inhibitory activity against the Hsp90 isoforms,
the data set used to generate the mt-QSAR-EL model was manually inspected,
and 35 molecular fragments were selected by considering the activity
values of the molecules to which they belong, as well as their frequency
in the data set (Figure 2). Then, the molecular descriptors present in the mt-QSAR-EL model
were calculated for these fragments.

Figure 2 Molecular fragments extracted from the
data set.

In this work, however, an ML-based
model has been developed instead
of one focused on linear regression methods. Consequently, a “pure
linear equation” cannot be generated. In ideal conditions,
an equation derived from linear regression methods will have standardized
independent variables (molecular descriptors), so the coefficients
accompanying these independent variables will express in some degree
the relative importance of each variable. In addition, it is always
possible to know the sign of the coefficients, and therefore, how
the value of a defined independent variable should change to increase
the value of the response variable. In the case of the mt-QSAR-EL
model, we have the importance/sensitivity values (Figure 1), which express the significance
of the molecular descriptors, and therefore, they can serve as coefficients.
At the same time, in Table 3, the relative tendency gives us information regarding the
direction (positive or negative) with which each molecular descriptor
should vary to increase the biological activity. Thus, a pseudolinear
equation can be written in the following form: 1  In eq 1, SAPi(bt) defines the
activity score of a fragment depending on the Hsp90 isoform against
which the analysis is realized. Now, the molecular descriptors calculated
for the different fragments can be substituted in eq 1, yielding the corresponding activity
scores as reported by the previous works.18,21−25 We note that now, one can in principle compare the molecular fragments
according to their quantitative contributions estimated by using eq 1, or any other linear equation.
However, the local physicochemical and structural information will
be diluted within the global activity scores. So, it becomes more
difficult to know the position in which a fragment should be placed
in a molecule to effectively contribute to the increase of the biological
activity. Here, local activity scores have been calculated according
to the following procedure.

First, a defined descriptor (e.g., D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt) and its coefficient
and the corresponding sign in eq 1 were considered as a local physicochemical/structural component.
The substitution of the values of D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt for the 35 fragments depicted
in Figure 2 in this
component yielded 35 local activity scores for each of the two Hsp90
isoforms. Therefore, in total, 70 local activity scores were calculated.
Second, each local activity score was divided by the total number
of atoms that constituted each fragment, and as a result, 70 normalized
local activity scores were generated. The purpose here was to eliminate
the effect of the size of the fragments. Third, the mean and the standard
deviation of the 70 normalized local activity scores were calculated.
Finally, the normalized local activity scores were standardized; from
each normalized local activity score, the mean was subtracted, and
the result was divided by the standard deviation. The standardized
local activity scores represent the relative quantitative contributions
of the molecular fragments to the inhibitory activity against the
two Hsp90 isoforms (Table 4). All of these steps were applied to the other molecular
descriptors in eq 1.

a The terminology “LQC_”
stands for the “local quantitative contribution”.

b C1: descriptor D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt; C2: descriptor D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt; C3: descriptor D[TmpAq0(PSA)_AM]bt; C4: descriptor D[TmpAq3(PSA)_MX]bt; C5: descriptor D[Xv(C)5]bt.

One should note that in the specific
case of the descriptor D[Xv(C)5]bt, instead of dividing the local activity
scores by the total number of atoms in a fragment, they were divided
by the denominator (nC + 1), nC being
the total number of those atoms (including the hydrogen atoms attached
to them) involved in the formation of clusters of order 5. That is
because while the other molecular descriptors account for the distribution
of physicochemical properties, D[Xv(C)5]bt is more focused on indicating the presence or absence of a
very specific kind of fragment. Consequently, if the clusters of order
5 are absent in a fragment, then the local activity score of the fragment
will have the same constant negative value; otherwise, the local activity
score will have a positive value, being this proportional to the number
of cluster of order 5 and the chemical environment of each atom in
the aforementioned clusters.

It is very important to point out
that the fragments with positive
contributions can be present in molecules annotated and correctly
classified as inactive, while the fragments with negative contributions
can be present in molecules assigned and correctly predicted as active.
The presence of a given fragment is not a sufficient condition for
the enhancement of the biological activity. Therefore, the local quantitative
contributions depicted in Table 4 reflect the relative tendency of the fragments to
influence the activity of the fragments to influence the activity
of a molecule according to its intrinsic physicochemical properties
when properly connected to other fragments; the suitability with which
a fragment should be connected strongly depends on the physicochemical/structural
interpretations of the molecular descriptors in the mt-QSAR-EL model,
which have been explained in the previous section.

In addition,
even though these local contributions will be restricted
to the chemico-biological space defined by the molecules in the data
set, they can guide medicinal chemists toward the detection of two-dimensional
(2D) pharmacophores.21,23

A careful inspection of Table 4 suggests that the
molecular fragments with positive
local quantitative contributions with respect to three or more physicochemical/structural
components (or with six or more positive values) are desirable for
the future design of highly active molecules against both Hsp90 isoforms.
Such contributions are represented with bold values. Therefore, they
may appear in different positions in the molecules, favorably contributing
to enhancing the inhibitory activity. This desirability of some of
these fragments is reflected in the molecules depicted in Figure 3, which are among
the most active in the database used in this study, and they contain
more than one of these positive fragments. For instance, fragments F3 and F22 appear in the first three molecules,
which are structurally related. Regardless of the other fragments
present in these molecules, it is clear that F3 and F22 play an important role in the inhibitory potency of the
molecules to which they belong. Other important fragments present
in the molecules illustrated in Figure 3 are F1, F2, F7, F12, F17, and F19. Special
attention must be paid to the fragment F12, which is
present in the molecule CHEMBL3234777. This is the only molecular
fragment with positive local contributions against all of the physicochemical/structural
components. Because of that, when properly connected, F12 can be used in any region of a molecule because it will always contribute
positively to the increment of the inhibitory activity. Of course,
all of the ideas explained here converge with the interpretations
of the molecular descriptors present in the mt-QSAR-EL model, which
allow the aforementioned fragments to be properly connected to the
others. We note that if one considers only the intrinsic physicochemical
properties of the different fragments while neglecting how properly
they should be connected, a huge amount of random molecules can be
generated, and they may not be active.

Figure 3 Molecules containing
some of the most desirable fragments associated
with the increment of the inhibitory activity against the Hps90 isoforms.

On the other hand, fragments with
negative local quantitative contributions
with respect to three or more physicochemical/structural components
can be detrimental to the inhibitory activity. Some of these fragments
are F5, F8, F9, F16, F32, and F35, and a similar analysis
to that performed for the positive fragments can be made. For example,
it can be deduced that if these fragments have negative local contributions
with respect to the physicochemical components C1 and C2 depicted
in Table 4, then, if
present in a molecule, they should be kept isolated (preferably in
the central region of the molecule) from other fragments with electronegative
atoms in such a way that the topological distance between electronegative
atoms is different from 3 and 7. In any case, the most interesting
aspect is that according to Table 4, the molecular fragment F5 is the most
undesirable of all due to its negative contribution against all of
the physicochemical/structural components regardless of the Hsp90
isoform. And yet, F5 appears in the most active molecules
of the data set (Figure 3). This has an explanation, and once again, everything obeys the
physicochemical/structural interpretations of the molecular descriptors
in the mt-QSAR-EL model. We note that despite having negative contributions
against all of the components, F5 is placed in the periphery
of the first three molecules represented in Figure 3, and according to the physicochemical interpretation
of the molecular descriptor D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt, that is a desirable aspect.
At the same time, in most of the cases, the electronegative atoms
of F5 are placed at topological distances different from
3 with respect to atoms belonging to other fragments. This favors
the diminution of the descriptor D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt, contributing to increasing
the activity. Finally, F5 has an atom (specifically a
halogen) attached to an aromatic carbon adjacent to one of the pyridinic
nitrogens. In addition, F5 is fused with another ring.
These two aspects generate two clusters of order 5 increasing the
value of D[Xv(C)5]bt, which is also
required for the enhancement of the inhibitory activity against the
Hsp90 isoforms. With F5, a similar situation happens
in the case of the compounds CHEMBL3675258, CHEMBL3675272, and CHEMBL3360305,
which are not shown in Figure 3 but are present in the Supporting Information 1, having been correctly classified by the mt-QSAR-EL model.

Another example is the molecular fragment F18, which,
being seemingly negative, appears in the molecule CHEMBL560895 (Figure 3). In F18, its pyridinic nitrogen is placed at a topological distance equal
to 3 with respect to the fluorine atoms (increasing D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt), which is detrimental to the inhibitory activity. Nevertheless,
by being connected to F7 while fused with F19 (both of them predominantly positive fragments), F18 is involved in the formation of four clusters of order 5, which
are very favorable for the enhancement of the inhibitory activity
against the Hsp90 isoforms.

In the end, it can be seen that
the application of the approach
involving the calculation of class-based mean values for each molecular
descriptor and the subsequent generation of a pseudolinear equation
for the calculation of fragment contributions have pros and cons.
From one side, a clear advantage of using this approach is that the
pseudolinear equation allows the rapid calculation of quantitative
contributions, enabling the comparison between fragments to select
those that are more suitable for the design of virtually potent dual
Hsp90 inhibitors. Thus, by combining the analysis of the different
quantitative contributions of the fragments and the physicochemical
interpretations of the molecular descriptors in the mt-QSR-EL model,
it is possible to establish a set of rules to define steric and electronic
features responsible for the enhancement of the inhibitory activity.
A second advantage is that a pseudolinear equation can in principle
be generated from any ML model as long as the molecular descriptors
will be somehow normalized and the software used to develop the ML
model will yield the values indicating the significance of the different
descriptors. For instance, as shown in the present study, the program
STATISTICA v6.0 calculates sensitivity values, which serve as weights
of the pseudolinear equation, indicating the influence of the molecular
descriptors in the mt-QSAR-EL model. If other techniques such as random
forest or support vector machine were used by the same program, then,
the so-called “importance values” would be calculated,
also serving as weights for the pseudolinear equation; as in the present
study, the means of the different classes/categories for each molecular
descriptor would also be compared to determine its tendency (increment
of diminution) in the model.

On the other hand, an important
limitation in the use of the pseudolinear
equation is that this will strongly depend on the performance of the
mt-QSAR model-EL. The approach based on the generation of a pseudolinear
equation is only valid because the model developed in this work shows
a very good performance; the percentages of correct classification
for active and inactive molecules are higher than 70%. With a poorer
performance, it would not make any sense at all to generate an equation
based on the tendencies of variation in the means of the molecular
descriptors in the mt-QSAR-EL model. A second disadvantage is that
because of the nonlinear nature of the mt-QSAR-EL model, the pseudolinear
equation may be useful in a seemingly restricted region of the chemical
space covered by this model. Nevertheless, the physicochemical properties
and structural features needed to inhibit the Hsp90 isoforms is plausibly
explained by the analysis of the molecular fragments and their local
quantitative contributions as depicted in Figures 2 and 3 and Table 4.

2.4 In Silico Design of Dual Hsp90 Inhibitors
Currently,
most of the QSAR models and related chemoinformatic
tools constructed from heterogeneous data sets of compounds are mainly
employed with the aim of performing virtual screening of large libraries
of chemicals. Nevertheless, most of the time, the experimental data
used to develop the models can have a great uncertainty because they
come from different laboratories. Additionally, it should be considered
that the molecular descriptors used to construct the models can characterize
only a limited fraction of the diversity and complexity codified within
the molecules.

When a model performs predictions of a certain
property/activity, it does that according to predetermined values
of the molecular descriptors used to construct it. When predicted,
many molecules may not follow the rules under which the model has
been developed. Here, it is not about how well a model will perform
according to any applicability domain approach or method focused on
determining the reliability of the predictions. This is based on the
fact that in any model, there is a degree of hierarchy among the molecular
descriptors, which embody a phenomenological meaning in the sense
of describing the physicochemical and structural features needed for
the improvement of the biological effect under study (in this particular
case, the inhibitory activity). Therefore, compounds whose molecular
descriptors follow such degree of hierarchy (as shown in Figure 1) will be predicted
with better accuracy, where the prediction will be expected to converge
to a greater extent with the experimental results. All of this is
usually neglected by the current models devoted to screening vast
chemical databases, but it was considered here when generating new
molecules.

To properly design new molecules, a series of steps
were followed.
First, in most of the cases, only those fragments with local quantitative
contributions against three or more physicochemical components were
selected. Second, the new molecules were assembled by connecting and/or
fusing different fragments. Third, when needed, certain atoms and/or
bioisosteric replacements were added to the structure of the molecule.
Last and most important, all of these chemical modifications mentioned
in the three previous aspects strictly obeyed the physicochemical
and structural interpretations of the molecular descriptors in the
mt-QSAR-EL model. In addition, the predominantly negative fragment F18 was added to different positions in the structure of the
designed molecules with the aim of analyzing the effect of the position
and the connectivity on the potential inhibitory activity.

Eight
molecules were designed (Figure 4), and all of them fell within the applicability
domain (Supporting Information 4). By considering
the cutoff value of inhibitory activity employed in this work (half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) ≤230 nM), six of
these molecules (IP-01 to IP-05 and IP-07) were predicted by the mt-QSAR-EL model as inhibitors
of both Hsp90 isoforms, while the molecules IP-06 and IP-08 were predicted as active against Hsp90α but inactive
with respect to Hsp90β (Supporting Information 4). We note that the presence of the fragment F18 does not define if a molecule will be active against the Hsp90 isoforms.
However, the fragment F18 has been fused with positive
fragments such as F3 and F17 in the way
of minimizing as much as possible the number of electronegative atoms
placed at the topological distances equal to three and seven (diminution
of the descriptors D[TnsAq3(E)_MX]bt and D[TmpAq7(E)_MN]bt). This fusion
also increases the number of clusters of order 5 (increasing the value
of descriptor D[Xv(C)5]bt).

Figure 4 New molecules
designed by using the mt-QSAR-EL model.

If one compares IP-05 with IP-06, it
is easy to see that they are similar molecules. Nevertheless, they
have two differences. One of them is the replacement of fragment F11 in IP-05 by a fragment similar to F18 in the molecule IP-06. In this sense, the fragment F18 has been correctly placed in the molecule IP-06 according to its positive contribution to the physicochemical component
C2 while favoring the physicochemical component C5. Still, this is
not enough for the molecule IP-05 to be predicted as
an inhibitor of both Hsp90 isoforms. The second divergent aspect is
the key because a fragment similar to F17 is present
in the two aforementioned molecules, but while there is an additional
substitution between the two hydroxyl groups in the molecule IP-05, such substitution is absent in IP-06.
This simple additional substitution dramatically favors the physicochemical
component C5, resulting in the difference of potential inhibitory
activity between IP-05 and IP-06. In terms
of additional substitutions present in an aromatic ring, a similar
situation to that involving IP-05 and IP-06 can be explained for the case of the molecules IP-07 and IP-08.

Finally, it should be noted that the
eight designed molecules were
not reported in the data set used to develop the mt-QSAR-EL model.
In this sense, ChEMBL and ZINC26 were used
to search for chemical similarities. The search did not produce any
exact match, and even when the similarity cutoff was set to be ≥0.8,
no results were found.

2.5 Assessing the Druglikeness
An essential
stage in any drug discovery campaign is the estimation of the druglikeness
of a molecule, i.e., how desirable is a chemical in terms of its bioavailability.
In this sense, Lipinski’s rule of five is a classically accepted
approach for the assessment of the bioavailability of the organic
compounds.27 According to this rule, a
chemical will have good oral bioavailability if it simultaneously
complies with all of the following properties: molecular weight (MW)
less than 500 Da, logarithm of the octanol–water partition
coefficient (C log P) lower than 5, no more than five hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), and
no more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs). However, Lipinski’s
rule of five has received some criticism regarding the cutoff value
of MW, and according to Veber and co-workers, the polar surface area
(PSA) and the number of rotatable bonds (RBNs) have been found to
better discriminate between compounds that are orally active from
those that are not.28 In this sense, it
has been established that the molecules with RBN ≤ 10 and PSA
< 140 Å2 are expected to have good oral availability.

All of these physicochemical properties were estimated for the
eight designed molecules (Table 5). The properties HBD and HBA were calculated manually;
fluorine atoms were considered as hydrogen bond acceptors while pyrrolic
nitrogens were not. The C log P was calculated by the program ChemDraw Ultra v8.0,29 and the other properties were calculated by
the software Marvin Sketch v15.11.16.0 from ChemAxon.30 The eight molecules comply with Lipinski’s rule
of five as well as with the Veber’s guidelines.

3 Conclusions
The Hsp90 family has become a focus of attention in drug discovery.
Particularly, the search for inhibitors simultaneously targeting several
Hsp90 isoforms is of great interest because it opens new horizons
toward the discovery of new chemicals capable of therapeutically modulating
many biochemical pathways involved in the emergence and development
of complex diseases. In this work, the present approach focused on
multitarget modeling represents a promising alternative toward the
discovery of dual Hsp90 inhibitors. By combining the good performance
of the mt-QSAR-EL model with the clear physicochemical/structural
interpretations of the molecular descriptors, it has been possible
to estimate the quantitative contributions of the fragments to the
inhibitory activity. This has permitted the guided design of eight
new molecules, six of them being predicted as potential dual Hsp90
inhibitors, and all of them displaying very good druglikeness. The
multitarget modeling methodology focused on the joint use of an ML
model with a fragment-based topological design approach can serve
as a powerful alternative to speed up early drug discovery by considering
important biomolecular targets such as the Hsp90 isoforms, whose roles
have been linked to genetic and epigenetic variations.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Generation of the Database
and Calculation
of the Molecular Descriptors
The methodology involved in
the development of the mt-QSAR models has been reported in detail
in the scientific literature.31−33 So, only the principal aspects
will be discussed here. All of the chemical and biological data reported
in this work were retrieved from ChEBML,34 an online source containing more than 15 million assay endpoints
against more than 1.8 million compounds. The data set used here was
formed by 983 molecules experimentally tested against at least one
of the two Hsp90 isoforms. In each assay, the in vitro potency against
the proteins was measured as IC50, i.e., the inhibitory
concentration causing 50% inhibition. When a molecule was assayed
more than one time against the same Hsp90 isoform, its IC50 values were averaged. It should be pointed out that not all of the
molecules present in the data set were assayed against both Hsp90
isoforms. Nevertheless, some molecules were tested against the two
Hsp90 isoforms. Consequently, the data set employed here contains
1030 statistical cases.

Each statistical case was assigned as
active [APi(bt) = 1] or inactive [APi(bt) = −1], with APi(bt) being a binary
categorical variable that described the inhibitory activity of the ith case/molecule with respect to a defined biological target
(in this case, an Hsp90 isoform). Such annotations were realized by
considering IC50 ≤ 230 nM as the cutoff value. Thus,
regardless of the Hsp90 isoform used in the assay, a molecule was
annotated as active if its activity was IC50 ≤ 230
nM; otherwise, the molecule was assigned as inactive. It is important
to note that in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery campaigns,
the search for hit compounds starts at the micromolar range (depending
on the target under analysis).35 As one
can see, the selected cutoff value appears in the medium nanomolar
range, which will improve the strictness of the model in the sense
of rapidly searching for (or designing) more potent inhibitors. Also,
from a statistical point of view, the cutoff value selected here avoids
any excessive imbalance between the number of molecules annotated
as active and those labeled as inactive.

All of the chemical
information was stored as SMILES codes in a
*.txt file, which was manually changed to *.smi. Then, to get information
regarding the 2D connectivity of the molecules, the program Standardizer
v15.11.16.0 was employed to convert the *.smi file to *.sdf.36 Two sets of molecular descriptors were calculated.
From one side, the software QUBILs-MAS v1.0 was used to calculate
the molecular descriptors known as nonstochastic and mutual probability
atom-based quadratic indices.37 In general
terms, quadratic indices have been used in different fields of research
associated with drug discovery,37−40 and currently, more advanced versions of these descriptors
can be calculated according to the following equations: 2  In eq 2, Li[qk(x)] represents
the local nonstochastic quadratic index of order k, which considers an atom i and its chemical environment
(formed by their jth neighbors) at the topological
distance d = k. The element x refers to any atomic physicochemical property such as
hydrophobicity (HYD), electronegativity (E), atomic weight, polar surface area (PSA), and atomic refractivity (AR), among others. At
the same time, the element kaij characterizes the adjacency between
any two atoms of the molecule. It should be emphasized that eq 2 is applied always to each
atom of a molecule. Then, the total nonstochastic atom-based quadratic
indices [TnsAqk(x)_MO] for a molecule having n atoms can be calculated by applying different mathematical/statistical
operators (MO) to the set of local quadratic indices Li[qk(x)]. Some examples are shown in
the following equations: 3   4   5   6  In eqs 3–6, the symbol Tnsqk(x) represents
the total nonstochastic quadratic index, while the MOs include (but are not limited to) the Manhattan distance (N1), the Euclidean distance (N2), the geometric
mean (GM), and the range (RA), the
latter considering the maximum (MX) and minimum (MN) values. For the calculation of the mutual probability
counterparts of the nonstochastic quadratic indices, the same equations
can be used; the only difference is that in eq 2, the element kaij of a nonstochastic
matrix is replaced by the element kpij of the mutual probability
matrix.24,41 Thus, while the general symbology of the
total nonstochastic atom-based quadratic indices is TnsAqk(x)_MO, the corresponding total mutual probability atom-based quadratic
indices will have the symbol TmpAqk(x)_MO. It should be pointed
out that the local atom-type quadratic indices have also been reported
in the literature to account for the substructural patterns contained
within the chemicals’ databases.42−44 However, in this study,
only the total quadratic indices have been used because, as depicted
in eqs 3–6, through the application of the diverse MOs, new classes of topological indices are created; such
hybrid molecular descriptors have an enhanced ability to characterize
local features in the molecules such as atom, bonds, and fragments.
Also, although seemingly simpler than their global counterparts, the
local atom-type quadratic indices may add complexity to the models
from a statistical point of view because a greater number of molecular
descriptors may be needed to develop the models.

Traditional
molecular descriptors such as the atom- and bond-based
connectivity indices, shape descriptors, and others widely reported
in the literature constituted the second set of molecular descriptors
used in this study;45 they were calculated
by the program ModesLab v1.5 using the SMILES codes stored in the
*.txt file.46 One should note that the
molecular descriptors reported in eqs 3 – 6 characterize only
the chemical structure of the molecules, being incapable of discriminating
the effect of the chemical structure of a molecule when this is assayed
against more than one target. In this context, the Box–Jenkins
approach can solve this inconvenience.47 In time series, Box–Jenkins operators involve the calculation
of successive average values of a given property of a system determined
at different intervals of time.48 In the
mt-QSAR methodology, the Box–Jenkins operators are not based
on the time domain. Instead, in a first step, the average of any molecular
descriptor is calculated according to the following mathematical formalism:49−51 7  In eq 7, TIa refers
to any of the topological indices mentioned above, including those
calculated via eqs 3–6, while avgTI(bt) is the average
of a topological index for all of the drugs/chemicals that were assayed
against the same protein and annotated as active. Consequently, n(bt) represents
the number of molecules assayed against the same Hsp90 isoform and
annotated as active. After, in a second step, the following formula
is applied 8  In eq 8, DTIa(bt)
is a deviation topological index, measuring
how much a drug/chemical structurally deviates from a set of compounds
annotated as active and assayed against the same Hsp90 isoform.52−56 On the other hand, TI(MX)(bt) and TI(MN)(bt) are the maximum and minimum values for a defined molecular
descriptor, respectively. In this case, TI(MX)(bt) and TI(MN)(bt) depend on the Hsp90 isoform
against which the molecules were tested. We note that DTIa(bt)
is also a normalized descriptor due to the presence of an average
in the numerator, and a subtraction between maximum and minimum values
in the denominator. In addition, DTIa(bt) is a multitarget descriptor
because it considers both the chemical structure and the Hsp90 isoform
against which a molecule was tested. It should be pointed out that eq 8 unifies the calculation
of the Box–Jenkins operators with the mean-based normalization
procedure.

4.2 Development of the mt-QSAR-EL
Model
The diverse steps involved in the development of the
mt-QSAR-EL model
are summarized in Figure 5. The data set composed of 1030 statistical cases was randomly
divided into training and test sets. The training set was employed
to find the best model, and it contained 774 cases (75.14%), 373 annotated
as active and 401 assigned as inactive. The test set was used to validate
the model, with the purpose of demonstrating its predictive power.
The test set contained 256 cases (24.86%), 121 considered active and
134 annotated as inactive. The ML method focused on ANNs was used
to generate the mt-QSAR-EL model. Particularly, the model was based
on an ensemble of ANNs.

Figure 5 Steps leading to the development of the mt-QSAR-EL
model.

Finding the best mt-QSAR-EL model
was subjected to finding the
collection of ANNs that cooperate in performing predictions in a consensus
voting manner. Several ANNs architectures were used in the search
for the single models: linear neural networks (LNN), radial basis
function (RBF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP).

The task of
generating the best mt-QSAR-EL model was performed
by the Intelligent Problem Solver of the ANNs package of the program
STATISTICA v6.0.57 The first run was used
to determine the most important ANNs architectures and the number
of ANNs forming the ensembles, rank the most significant molecular
descriptors, and estimate the correlations between them. The diversity
among the ANNs models forming the ensemble was considered. In this
sense, all of the ANNs models forming the ensemble were inspected
in the sense that they obligatorily needed to have different number
of neurons in their hidden layers, as well as different training and
test errors (as low as possible) while having different values (but
as high as possible) of the statistical indices Sn(%), and Sp(%), Ac(%), and MCC.58 These statistical indices
were used to assess the internal quality (training set) and the predictive
power (test set) of the mt-QSAR-EL model.

On the other hand,
the most significant molecular descriptors were
ranked according to the importance analysis (also known as sensitivity
analysis) available in the Intelligent Problem Solver of the ANNs
package of the program STATISTICA v6.0. This procedure attempts to
quantify the effect of a defined molecular descriptor by calculating
a ratio of the error generated in the ANN when estimating the value
of the molecular descriptor using a missing value procedure, and the
error generated in the ANN by using the real value of a molecular
descriptor. The most influential molecular descriptors are those with
importance values (SV) higher than 1; only these
descriptors were chosen to enter the final model. Consequently, the
importance analysis served as a variable selection strategy.

Finally, the correlations between the molecular descriptors were
estimated, and the cutoff interval −0.7 < PCC < 0.7 was
used as the criterion to determine the lack of redundancy, PCC being
the Pearson’s correlation coefficient.59 Those descriptors that fell outside the aforementioned interval
were not used in the search for the best mt-QSAR-EL model.
