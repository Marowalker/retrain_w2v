Stainless steel (SS)
surfaces were grafted with poly(glycidyl methacrylate)
(PGMA) brushes that were post-modified using allylamine, diallylamine,
and propylamine as reagents. Likewise, poly[2-(diethylamino)ethyl
methacrylate] brushes were synthesized. All samples were compression
molded with uncured ethylene-propylene-diene M-class rubber and dicumyl
peroxide and vulcanized for 12 min at 170 °C. The efficiency
of the novel bonding solution was evaluated through peel experiments.
Two parameters, the fracture toughness () and the cohesive-to-adhesive fracture
ratio (Ar), were calculated to evaluate
the strength and the performance of the coupling, respectively. For
the nanometer-thin PGMA films modified with allylamine, in particular,
full cohesive fracture was obtained. The obtained values of  (15.4 ±
1.1 N mm–1) and Ar (1.00
± 0.01) matched those
obtained for a micrometer-thick commercial bonding agent. Cross-linking
of polymer brushes by intermolecular reactions by the primary amines
proved to have a significant impact on the type of fracture (cohesive/adhesive)
and the performance of the adhesives.

1 Introduction
Over
the last decades, the development of components employing
surface modifications has become a major research field of both academic
and industrial interest. Properties such as cell adhesion,1 fouling resistance,2 low friction,3 and wettability4 may be designed by chemical adjustment of the
first few nanometers of a component surface. Hence, continued development
of new and more beneficial ways of surface design is pertinent.

Adhesion of rubber to a metal is important for various purposes,
including bridge bearings, mounts in car engines, tires, and so on.5−7 What makes rubber particularly efficacious for such applications
is its high elasticity and resistance to oxygen, ozone, ultraviolet
light, and heat.8 Unfortunately, most rubbers
have a low wettability, and it is hard to create adhesion to metals,
rendering interlocking designs the common solution. One interesting
approach for handling the adhesion issue is through a chemical modification
of either the rubber or the metal. Functionalization of rubber includes
halogenation, cyclization, or copolymerization with polar monomers
to increase the wettability.9 Still, pretreatment
of the metal is the most extensively used approach to enhance metal–rubber
adhesion. Solution-based organic primers and binders are widely employed,
and components such as chlorinated polymers and poly(butadiene) are
required (among a variety of other additives) to obtain strong adhesion.10,11 The challenge with these primers is that they are applied in large
amounts (at least a few micrometers in thickness) and are unable to
establish covalent bonds all the way from the metal surface to the
rubber. For these reasons, development of highly efficient thin-layer
primer systems would be desirable.

Several methodologies can
be applied for a surface-confined polymerization,
that is, free radical polymerization (thermal, photochemical, or radiochemical),
controlled radical polymerization, anionic polymerization, or electropolymerization.
In this work, we used the controlled radical polymerization approach
because the aim was to produce brushes covalently anchored to the
substrate with good control of length and with minimal cross-linking
of the brushes. Anchoring of polymer brushes to metal surfaces is
a versatile approach of making a metal compatible with a given coating.2,12 Several methods have been designed to ensure both durability and
high grafting densities of polymer brushes generating a nanometer-thin
primer layer.13−16 Specifically, poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) and poly[2-(diethylamino)ethyl
methacrylate] (PDEAEMA) polymer brushes may be grown from various
surfaces using a controlled radical polymerization. The PGMA brushes
can subsequently be modified, exploiting the fact that nucleophiles
such as amines,17,18 thiols,19 and azides20 are able to open the oxirane
ring.

In this way, using, for example, allyl- or diallylamine
as nucleophile,
allylic groups can be introduced to exploit their ability to couple
with, for example, an ethylene-propylene-diene M-class (EPDM) rubber
during the thermal peroxide free-radical curing process.8,21 This would create covalent bonding across the entire interface to
ensure strong metal–rubber adhesion. Usually, rubber additives
such as triallyl isocyanurate would be introduced to promote effective
cross-linking of EDPM rubber by free radical addition and cyclopolymerization
reactions.8 It is also known that polymerization
of diallylamine normally yields highly cross-linked polymer networks.22

It is worth noting that with allylamine
serving as a nucleophile
in the ring opening of the oxirane groups in PGMA, it would itself
be transformed into a secondary amine. This secondary amine can react
further, either intra- or intermolecularly, with another oxirane ring
in the PGMA films to give a cross-linked brush structure, even before
the curing process.17,23 If this kind of cross-linking
is unwanted while the introduction of allyl groups is still a goal,
the nucleophile to go for would be the secondary diallylamine.

Figure 1 presents
an overview of the steps involved in this work. First, PGMA and PDEAEMA
polymer brushes are grown from stainless steel (SS) along with PGMA
polymer brushes modified using either allylamine, diallylamine, or
propylamine as the nucleophile. The brush films are analyzed by ellipsometry,
infrared reflectance–absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Samples are then installed in a
sample holder and compression-molded with EPDM rubber covalently linking
rubber and polymer brushes (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). Bonding properties are evaluated by peel testing
and subsequent three-dimensional (3D) scanning of the fractured surfaces.
The fracture toughness () and cohesive-to-adhesive
fracture ratio
(Ar) are used to quantify the adhesive
strength and performance of the joints. The different bonding systems
are compared in terms of reactivity toward the EPDM rubber, and the
impact of the ability of the primary amines to covalently link the
polymer films inter- and intramolecularly is discussed. A commercial
and traditional bonding agent, Chemosil (see Materials
and Methods), is used as the reference system.

is evaluated.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Examination of the Reaction
Protocol
Scheme 1 outlines
the general procedure used for producing polymer brushes at the SS
surfaces. In brief, the SS samples were electrografted using the diazonium
salt approach, specifically 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzene diazonium tetrafluoroborate
(HEBD), to generate surface-attached primary alcohols (SSOH). These were acylated to afford tertiary bromoalkyl groups (SSBr), that is, the radical initiators.24 Polymer brushes (SSPGMA) were then grown from SSBr using the surface-initiated activators regenerated by electron
transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ARGET-ATRP) protocol.25−29

Scheme 1 Steps Involved in the Synthesis of Covalently Attached Polymer Brushes
on SS: (1) Electrografting of HEBD To Form Covalently Attached Hydroxyl
Terminated SS Samples (SSOH), (2) Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution
on SSOH with 2-Bromoisobutyryl Bromide To Afford Bromine
Terminated Radical Initiator Layer Films (SSBr), and (3)
SI-ARGET ATRP Using GMA or DEAEMA as Monomer to Produce Surface-Attached
Polymer Brushes (SSPGMA or SSPDEAEMA)
Next, the PGMA brushes were
post-modified under various conditions
using either of the three amines, that is, allylamine, propylamine,
or diallylamine, as a reagent to open the oxirane rings (Scheme 2). This produced
three kinds of modified samples in terms of (A) SSallyl, (B) SSpropyl, or (C) SSdiallyl. In fact,
the SSdiallyl sample came in two versions, that is, SSdiallyl-1, to denote that 0.41 M diallylamine was used
in the post-modification step, and SSdiallyl-2 using
a higher concentration of 0.81 M.

Scheme 2 Post-polymerization Modification of
PGMA Brushes Using (A) Allylamine,
(B) Propylamine, or (C) Diallylamine as Reagent
Figure 2A shows
that the dry film thickness (d) of the PGMA brushes
on SSPGMA increases proportionally with time, as expected
for SI-ARGET-ATRP. Next, the reaction of diallylamine with SSPGMA was investigated. In general, the dry film thickness of
the corresponding SSdiallyl-1 samples consistently
increases by 10–20 nm. Figure 2B illustrates the trend in the relative thickness increase
due to the reaction with the diallylamine in terms of a plot of ddiallyl-1/dPGMA versus dPGMA. It is seen that ddiallyl-1/dPGMA decreases from 1.44 ± 0.11 to 1.15 ± 0.06 as dPGMA increases, suggesting that the reaction mechanism
changes as the brush layer thickness increases. On the assumption
that each oxirane group would react with one diallylamine molecule
and that the thickness increase can be calculated directly from the
resulting mass increase, one ends up with ddiallyl/dPGMA = 1.68. If the concentration of
the diallylamine is doubled to 0.81 M (that is, the “diallyl-2”
series), the determined value of ddiallyl-2/dPGMA becomes as high as 1.78 ±
0.15. This indicates that for short PGMA brushes, essentially, every
single oxirane ring reacts if the availability of diallylamine is
high. In contrast, for the thicker films, the concentration of diallylamine
decreases with the distance from the top of the brush structure, leaving
oxirane rings at the bottom unmodified.

Figure 2 (A) Dry film thickness
of SSPGMA (blue squares) and
SSdiallyl-1 (green circles) versus the polymerization
time. Linear regression of the data pertaining to SSPGMA is shown by the dashed blue line. (B) Plot of ddiallyl-1/dPGMA versus dPGMA.

Using allylamine and propylamine as nucleophiles gives dallyl/dPGMA = 1.31
± 0.08 and dpropyl/dPGMA = 1.45 ± 0.05. In the latter case, this is close
to the 1.42 expected for a 1:1 amine–oxirane reaction ratio,
whereas in the former case, the value is equally close to the 1.2
expected for a 1:2 amine–oxirane reaction ratio. Note that
the concentrations used for both of these amines are high (>0.6
M),
making their availability throughout the film high. One interesting
aspect of the three reactions is that although the secondary diallylamine
cannot participate in a cross-linking reaction with two oxirane groups,
the primary allylamine and propylamine can. Ultimately, complete cross-linking
of the brush structure would result in a 1:2 amine–oxirane
ratio, which, thus, seems to be an option for at least the allylamine.
In addition, the extent of a potential chain reaction involving the
alkoxy anion from an opened ring with another oxirane seems to be
insignificant because this would have resulted in an even smaller
mass gain and, accordingly, a smaller film thickness increase.

To support these propositions obtained from the ellipsometry measurements,
we resorted to recording the IRRAS spectra of the produced samples
(Figure 3). For SSPGMA, bands at 3010 and 2950 cm–1 are assigned
to the C–H sp3 bond stretching, that at 1735 cm–1 to the C=O bond stretch of an unconjugated
ester group, those at 1510–1430 cm–1 to C–H
deformations, those at 1310–1035 cm–1 to
C–O stretching, and that at 909 cm–1 to the
oxirane ring deformation.30 For SSallyl, SSdiallyl-2, and SSpropyl, the IRRAS spectra show a complete disappearance of the oxirane band (using
concentrations of 0.67 M allylamine, 0.81 M diallylamine, and 0.61
M propylamine). This is seen most clearly from the spectrum of SSpropyl, whereas in the spectra of SSallyl and SSdiallyl-2, a new close-by peak at 930 cm–1, attributed to C–H out-of-plane bending from the introduced
olefin moieties, is observed. In comparison, the spectrum of SSdiallyl-1 (based on the lower diallylamine concentration
of 0.41 M) shows oxirane groups (Figure S2, Supporting Information) in line with the smaller increase in film thickness
noted in this case (vide supra). For SSPDEAEMA (see Scheme 1), a peak at 2820
cm–1 is attributed to the C–H sp3 stretch from an aliphatic component bonded to a tertiary
amine, which also appears for the SSdiallyl-2 samples.
For all modified PGMA samples, the C=O peak is slightly broadened,
most likely because of hydrogen bonding between the C=O ester
groups and the hydroxyl groups formed in the ring-opening process.30

Figure 3 IRRAS spectra of various modified SS samples normalized
with respect
to the C=O absorbance.

Table 1 provides
the atomic concentrations of the SSPGMA, SSallyl, SSdiallyl-2, and SSpropyl samples
recorded by XPS along with the ratios of dry film thicknesses, that
is, d/dPGMA (see Figure S3 for survey spectra of SS, SSBr, SSPGMA, and SSallyl and Table S1 for atomic compositions, Supporting Information). For SSPGMA, the major contributions originate from C and O with a C/O ratio
= 2.7, which is only slightly larger than the expected 2.3 for a PGMA
film. A minor Cl 2p component is found at 200.0 eV from the end-capped
PGMA brushes. The small amount of nitrogen detected might originate
from residual 2,2′-bipyridine (BiPy) used in the polymerization
protocol. Noticeably, the high-resolution XPS spectra of SSPGMA and SSallyl (Figure S4 and Table S2, Supporting Information) show the large extent by which
the characteristic C 1s signal from the oxirane C–O–C
group in SSPGMA is diminished after modification with allylamine.
At the same time, the intensity of the aliphatic components (C–C)
is increased as expected.31

a For all investigations, dPGMA is in the 30–50 nm range.

b Traces of sodium, sulfur, phosphorus,
and zinc were detected.

For the SSpropyl and SSallyl samples, the
N/C ratios are 0.058 and 0.059, respectively, being equal to
the expected 0.059 in the case of a 1:2 amine–oxirane reaction
(repeating C17O6N units; see Schemes 1 and 2). For a 1:1 amine–oxirane reaction, the N/C ratio would be
0.1 (repeating C10O3N units, see Schemes 1 and 2). Hence, the results indicate that cross-bonding of polymer segments,
either inter- or intramolecularly, takes place when modifying with
primary amines. In comparison, SSdiallyl-2 (secondary
amine) shows a N/C ratio of 0.063, which is slightly lower than the
0.077 (repeating C13O3N units; see Schemes 1 and 2) expected of a 1:1 amine–oxirane ratio. These results
are in accordance with the interpretation of the d/dPGMA determinations for diallylamine
and allylamine, although the 1.45 for the propylamine seems to be
too high considering that the expected value for a cross-bonding situation
is 1.2. In a previous study, where PGMA brushes were reacted with
propylamine in aqueous medium, a depth profiling XPS study showed
an enrichment of nitrogen in the upper layers.16 This indicated that the amine–oxirane stoichiometry
presumably changed from 1:1 in the upper brush layer to a smaller
value in the lower brush layer. A direct comparison with our investigation
is made difficult by the fact that two different solvents are used,
that is, N,N-dimethylformamide and
water.

2.2 Peel Test of SSChemosil and SSallyl
Figure 4 (left) presents peel curves of three SSChemosil reference samples and two SSallyl samples along with
pictures of relevant fracture surfaces. Four stages in response to
the applied loading could be identified: (1) loading of the specimen,
during which the rubber arm is bent and stretched, (2) stable crack
propagation, (3) unstable crack propagation, and (4) loss of load
carrying capacity.32 For the SSChemosil samples, the peel curves consistently achieved high forces, leaving
the exposed surface area (7.85 × 7.85 mm2) completely
covered with rubber after fracture (Figure 4, picture 1). The peel curve from the two
SSallyl samples displays about the same high force as that
from SSChemosil with the characteristic four stages of
load response indicating cohesive fracture (Figure 4, picture 2).

Figure 4 Graphs showing peel forces
of two SSallyl (black) and
three SSChemosil samples. The pictures are peel profiles
of (1) SSChemosil, (2) SSallyl, (3) SSdiallyl-2, and (4) SSpropyl after fracture.

Table 2 provides
the average  and Ar values
determined for the peeled samples. For SSChemosil, they
are in good agreement with the literature,33 showing full cohesive fracture (Ar =
1). It should be noted that a low Ar may
still result in a large  if the cohesive
fracture area covers the
entire width (perpendicular to the crack growth direction) of the
exposed sample area. Furthermore, in the case of cohesive fracture,  does not quantify
the interfacial toughness
but the toughness of the rubber. In the case of SSallyl, the values of  (15.4 ±
1.1) and Ar (1.00 ± 0.01) are similar
to those of the SSChemosil reference (15.2 ± 0.4,
and 1.00 ± 0.00).
This is an encouraging result, considering that the thickness of the
SSallyl interface is in the nanometer range and at least
100 times thinner than that of the commercial Chemosil system. The
SSallyl samples were synthesized from initiator-based SSBr samples with an atomic percentage of Br ≈ 2.2 (determined
by XPS), which turned out to be an important feature. With low grafting
density samples having less than 1% Br (produced according to previous
studies),12,34 the peel results showed large variations
(Table S3, Supporting Information).

a Two out of seven
samples did not
yield cohesive fracture and were not included in the result.

b From ref (32).

In
our previous study,32 we promoted
adhesion by activating PGMA brushes with drop-casted benzoyl peroxide
(BPO). Some adhesion was found, although a severe problem was encountered
in having a rather non-uniform distribution of BPO on the surface
along with the “washing” away of BPO from the edges
during compression molding, a problem which could be anticipated to
be even larger with the injection molding technique. Herein, we exploit
the availability of radicals in the interface during the vulcanization
to form directly the chemical bonds between the modified PGMA brushes
and the EPDM rubber.8,21 Specifically, the allylic and
aliphatic radicals formed by H abstraction in the EPDM rubber can
react by addition to the double bonds in the allyl- and diallylamine-modified
PGMA brushes.

2.3 Peel Test of SSdiallyl-2
With SSdiallyl-2, large adhesively fractured
areas are visible (Figure 4, picture 3), indicating that the fracture
behavior is less consistent than that of SSallyl. The value
of Ar (0.55 ± 0.37) shows a large
variation in cohesive fracture and comes with a corresponding lower
and fluctuating  (11.9 ±
3.1). The initial expectation
was that the SSdiallyl-2 samples would promote a
higher degree of covalent linking in the rubber/brush interface because
of the higher numbers of allyl groups available. However, the adhesion
becomes weaker, which presumably is associated with the inability
of the secondary amines to cross-link the brush structure.

2.4 Peel Test of SSpropyl and SSPDEAEMA
The SSpropyl substrates show reasonably
good adhesive properties (Figure 4, picture 4), although the propyl group contains no
double bonds (  = 12.0 ±
1.9 and Ar = 0.95 ± 0.10).
Hence, a lack of unsaturated
bonds in itself is not sufficient to prevent the radical chemistry
– in terms of addition and/or combination reactions21 occurring during curing – from establishing
covalent bonding between the brushes and the rubber. Both the amine
and the secondary alcohol (formed upon ring opening) in SSpropyl facilitate H abstraction and subsequent addition to olefins in the
rubber.35 Importantly, the lone pairs on
the heteroatoms exert a stabilizing effect on an adjacent radical
center once formed.36,37 Surprisingly, the SSPDEAEMA samples show no adhesive properties, even if the intrinsic reactivity
of SSPDEAEMA would be expected to be similar to that of
SSpropyl. Most likely, this can be explained by a somewhat
different polymer brush structure of SSPDEAEMA, considering
that it is produced directly in SI-ARGET-ATRP (Scheme 1); the monomer already contains the amine
functionality. Finally, it should be noted that the SSPGMA sample itself shows no adhesion at all to the rubber.

2.5 Effect of Cross-Linking on Stress Distribution
along the Bondline
Until now, we have only paid little attention
to the effect that cross-linking in the brush structure exerts on
the adhesion properties. Following the analysis of adhesive joints
given by Penado et al.,38 the length of
the process zone in a peel experiment, that is, the region of tensile
stress in front of the crack tip, depends on the stiffness. The stiffness
is understood to be a combination of material and geometrical parameters
of both the rubber and the adhesive, in particular, the elastic modulus
(E) and the thickness. The stress distribution in
front of the crack affects the overall fracture process. Increasing
the cross-linking density of, for example, rubber increases its E modulus39,40 and consequently the process
zone length, thereby, altering the stress distribution.41,42 Distributing the stresses over a larger area means that the peak
stress reduces and, thus, makes the structure appear tougher.

As a result, cross-linking the polymer brushes by modification with
primary amines may increase the process zone length and enhance the
adhesive strength of the polymer films. The remarkable bonding ability
of the SSallyl samples is thus attributed to the cross-linked
polymer structure. Likewise, the enhanced adhesion observed for the
propylamine can be assigned to the corresponding cross-linked nature
of the polymer brushes. In contrast, SSdiallyl and SSPDEAEMA are unable to reinforce the brush structure by internal
cross-linking, and therefore, the adhesion abilities become poor.

3 Conclusions
PGMA brushes were covalently
grafted from stainless steel and modified
with allylamine, diallylamine, and propylamine. In addition, a PDEAEMA
brush film containing a tertiary amine was produced in a direct polymerization
without the need for the final post-modification step. All modified
samples were over-molded with EPDM rubber, cured, and peel tested
to evaluate the adhesion between the SS and the rubber. The nanometer-thin
PGMA brushes modified with allylamine consistently obtained an adhesion
as strong as that provided by a micrometer-thick commercial bonding
agent. This holds promise for potential industrial applications of
such brushes. For the diallylamine- and propylamine-based PGMA brushes,
the adhesion was inconsistent but much better than that of PDEAEMA.
The fact that the primary allylamine and propylamine can establish
cross-linking of the polymer brushes during post-modification is suggested
to have a significantly positive effect on both the fracture toughness
and the cohesive-to-adhesive fracture ratio of the adhesives.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Acetone
(HPLC grade), acetonitrile
(MeCN, HPLC grade), methanol (MeOH, HPLC grade), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, HPLC grade), dichloromethane
(DCM, HPLC grade), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, 99%), 2-(diethylamino)ethyl
methacrylate (DEAEMA, 99%), 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide (BIBB, 98%),
2,2′-bipyridine (BiPy, >99%), triethylamine (TEA, >99%),
sodium
ascorbate (NaAsc, >99%), allylamine (98%), diallylamine (99%),
and
propylamine (>99%) were all purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and CuIICl2·2H2O (99%) from Merck. The
materials were all used without further purification, the exception
being GMA and DEAEMA, which were passed through an aluminum oxide
column before polymerization to remove the inhibitor. Standard procedures
were followed to prepare the supporting electrolyte tetrabutylammonium
tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzene
diazonium tetrafluoroborate (HEBD).24,43 Stainless
steel (ASTM316) plates were cut into test pieces of 2 × 10 ×
10 mm3 size (Jensen Metal A/S, Denmark) (Supporting Information, Figure S1, item 4). They were
polished for 1 h using a diamond suspension (Struer, grain size of
9 μm) followed by 10 min sonication in Milli-Q water and in
acetone. Noncured EPDM rubber (Shore 70) containing dicumyl peroxide
(DCP) (AVK Gummi A/S) was used for compression molding. A commercial
bonding agent, Chemosil 211/411 (Lord Corporation, USA), was spray-painted
on the steel surfaces, annealed at 140 °C for 1 h to yield
a 30 μm layer, and used as a reference sample (SSChemosil).

4.2 Preparation of Initiator Layer
Electrochemical
grafting was performed on SS substrates using the protocol described
elsewhere.24 In short (see Scheme 1), SS substrates were modified
by potentiostatic electrolysis of 2 mM HEBD in 0.1 M Bu4NBF4/MeCN for 300 s at a potential 0.2 V more negative
than the voltammetric peak potential, Ep,c. The peak potential was determined from an initial cyclic voltammetric
sweep carried out at a sweep rate of 0.1 V s–1.
Next, the formed hydroxyl terminated SS samples (SSOH)
were acylated in 0.46 M BIBB and 0.05 M TEA in DCM at room temperature.
This afforded a bromine terminated radical initiator layer film (SSBr). The SSOH and SSBr samples were rinsed
in MeCN and DCM, respectively, and sonicated for 10 min in acetone.

4.3 Polymerization
For the SI-ARGET-ATRP,
solutions of 1:1 (v/v) MeOH–Milli-Q water (2 × 4.5 mL)
and GMA (1 mL, 0.8 M) were mixed in a Schlenk flask, placed in an
ice bath, and purged with Ar for 15 min under stirring. BiPy (12.4
mg, 8.0 mM), NaAsc (7 mg, 3.5 mM), and CuIICl2·2H2O (6.8 mg, 4.0 mM) were added, and the solution
was purged with Ar for additional 10 min. SSBr substrates
were immersed into the reaction mixture and polymerized at 0 °C
for 0.25–2.0 h under an Ar atmosphere (Scheme 1). To examine the livingness of the polymerization,
the substrates were pulled out of the solution at 15 min intervals
and flushed with Ar. The samples produced (SSPGMA)
were rinsed with Milli-Q water and MeOH, followed by sonication in
acetone. The polymerization of DMEAMA followed the same procedure
to obtain corresponding modified samples denoted SSPDMEAMA.

4.4 PGMA Modification with Amine Reagents
The amine reactant was added to a three-necked flask containing 19
mL of DMF. The solution was flushed with Ar for 10 min and heated
to a given reaction temperature. Samples were immersed in the solution
and kept there under an Ar atmosphere for ∼18 h. The modified
samples were rinsed with DMF and sonicated for 10 min in acetone. Table 3 lists the specific
conditions used in each case.

4.5 Compression Molding
Compression molding
was employed to cure the rubber and facilitate bond formation between
rubber and the SS samples. Two modified SS samples and one blank SS
sample were fitted in a sample holder (Figure S1, item 3) and placed in a heated aluminum mold (PID regulated,
Eagle model #1048) in a hydraulic press (Carver model #3912). The
aluminum molds (Figure S1, items 1, 6,
and 7) were preheated to 170 °C. A sheet of nonvulcanized rubber
(Figure S1, item 2), of approx. 80 ×
20 × 6 mm3 size, was placed on top of the sample holder,
and 6 tons of pressure was applied for 12 min at 170 ± 2 °C.
Finally, the over-molded samples were post-cured in an oven (Binder
E28, Holm og Halby, DK) for 4 h at 150 °C.

4.6 Peel Testing
A full description of
the test setup and the data treatment is provided elsewhere.32 In general, peel tests were conducted on a universal
testing machine (Zwick Z005, Zwick GmbH & Co. KG, Ulm-Einsingen,
Germany) under a loading rate of 0.5 mm s–1. A custom-made
fixture consisting of a sled and a base both fixed to the testing
machine was designed. Translating on low-friction brass wheels, the
sled ensured a constant peel angle close to 90°. This setup differs
from the usual peel experiment where an inextensible tape is peeled
along a macroscopically homogeneous growth path. Either two or three
specimens separated from each other by an 8.5 mm nonbonded area provided
a discontinuous path. Equation 1 was used to calculate the peel energy (P). 1  In this expression, F is
the measured force, and b is the width
of the crack perpendicular to the peel direction, that is, the width
of the exposed sample area (b = 7.85 mm). It is assumed
that P equals the fracture toughness (), once the crack
starts to propagate.

4.7 Optical Profilometry
Fracture regions
were examined with a 3D macroscopic scanner (VR-3200, Keyence, Japan)
with 160× magnification to determine the type of fracture (interfacial/adhesive
or cohesive). The fraction of the cohesively failed area relative
to the exposed surface area (7.85 × 7.85 mm2), Ar = Acohesive/Atotal, was determined for each sample as a quantitative
measure of the bonding quality.

4.8 Ellipsometry
For dry film thickness
measurements, a rotating analyzer ellipsometer (Dre, Germany) with
a He–Ne laser (632.8 nm) was used. The SS substrates were irradiated
at a 75° angle of incident. The parameters Δ (phase shift)
and ψ (ratio of amplitude upon reflection) were measured and
processed in the Ellips32 software. The software calculated the complex
refractive index of the bare surfaces from Δ and ψ, whereas
for the modified surfaces, a three-layer optical model was used. The
refractive index of the organic film was assumed to be 1.55, independent
of the thickness. Three measurements per SS sample were performed
on three different spots for all substrates, both pre- and post-modification.
Film thicknesses reported for brush modified samples were all subtracted
for the initiator layer thickness.

4.9 Infrared
Reflectance–Absorption Spectroscopy
(IRRAS)
A Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Denmark) equipped with a Varian external experiment module with a
narrow band mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT/A) detector
cooled with liquid nitrogen was employed for recording the IRRAS spectra.
The spectral resolution and number of scans averaged were 4 cm–1 and 200, respectively. All spectra were recorded
at room temperature in a dry atmosphere. The logarithm of the p-polarized reflectivity of the film divided by the reflectivity
of the bare substrate was presented as IRRAS absorbance. The substrates
were irradiated at an incident angle of 80°. Baseline correction
was performed using the OMNIC 8.2 software, and spectra were normalized
with respect to the C=O absorbance.

4.10 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
A Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD
spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd, UK)
with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source at power = 150 W was
used for the XPS analysis. All survey spectra were acquired by accumulation
of two sweeps from 0 to 1400 eV at a pass energy of 160 eV and a pass
energy of 20 eV for high-resolution spectra. The pressure in the chamber
was kept below 5 × 10–9 mbar during measurements.
An electron flood gun was employed as a neutralizer, and the C 1s
peak of C–C/C–H components was used as reference for
charge correction with binding energy ≡ 285.0 eV. Data collections
were obtained from three measurement points on one sample. Spectral
processing was carried out using CasaXPS v2.3.15 software (Casa Software
Ltd, Teignmouth, U.K.).
