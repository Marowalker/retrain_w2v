In clinical settings, the dosing
and differential diagnosis of
the poisoning of morphine (MO) and codeine (CO) is challenging due
to interindividual variations in metabolism. However, direct electrochemical
detection of these analytes from biological matrices is inherently
challenging due to interference from large concentrations of anions,
such as ascorbic acid (AA) and uric acid (UA), as well as fouling
of the electrode by proteins. In this work, a disposable Nafion-coated
single-walled carbon nanotube network (SWCNT) electrode was developed.
We show facile electron transfer and efficient charge separation between
the interfering anions and positively charged MO and CO, as well as
significantly reduced matrix effect in human plasma. The Nafion coating
alters the voltammetric response of MO and CO, enabling simultaneous
detection. With this SWCNT/Nafion electrode, two linear ranges of
0.05–1 and 1–10 μM were found for MO and one linear
range of 0.1–50 μM for CO. Moreover, the selective and
simultaneous detection of MO and CO was achieved in large excess of
AA and UA, as well as, for the first time, in unprocessed human plasma.
The favorable properties of this electrode enabled measurements in
plasma with only mild dilution and without the precipitation of proteins.

1 Introduction
Morphine
(MO) and codeine (CO) are alkaloids from the opioid drug
class that are widely used in pain management.1 The use of morphine and codeine is, however, associated with adverse
effects, such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, sedation, dependence,
and respiratory depression.2 MO is a strong
opioid used to treat moderate and severe postoperative as well as
cancer pain, whereas the weak opioid codeine is used as an antitussive
and analgesic to treat moderate pain. Unlike morphine, codeine is
considered a prodrug and is metabolically activated by O-demethylation to morphine.

The biotransformation of codeine
to morphine is mediated by the
genetically polymorphic enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. Interindividual
differences in CYP2D6 activity cause significant variation in the
efficacy and safety of codeine as an analgesic. Poor metabolizers
lacking CYP2D6 activity have been shown to have extremely low plasma
morphine concentrations and therefore no analgesic effect.3 On the other hand, several cases of severe side
effects have been reported after the intake of codeine in individuals
later identified as ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates.4−6 In addition, significant variation in the bioavailability of oral
morphine has been reported.7 Morphine is
also one of the main active metabolites of heroin, and the morphine/codeine
ratio in blood has been proposed as a biomarker for heroin abuse.8 Thus, a fast, inexpensive method for determining
the individual concentrations of these opioids in the presence of
each other is highly desirable.

Current methods require a dedicated
laboratory and personnel, as
well as time-consuming sample processing. In contrast, electrochemical
measurements are relatively rapid, mobile, and inexpensive. Moreover,
the electrochemical detection of drugs in biological matrices has
been reported.9−11

In recent years, single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) have attracted
a great deal of attention due to their unique structure and extraordinary
properties, such as large surface area, mechanical strength, high
electrical conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity.12 By means of aerosol chemical vapor deposition,
large areas of porous SWCNT electrodes with high conductivity and
surface area can be produced.13,14 This process allows
for the collection of patterned networks that can be easily press-transferred
to produce electrodes without the need for the modification of conventional
carbon electrodes.13−15 This enables the production of inexpensive disposable
SWCNT electrodes.

Unfortunately, biological fluids always contain
high concentrations
(100–500 μM) of electroactive interferents such as ascorbic
acid (AA) and uric acid (UA).16 In contrast,
therapeutic plasma morphine concentrations usually range between 10
and 100 nM.3,17,18 However, concentrations above 1 μM have been reported in patients
with advanced cancer and in fatal cases of morphine poisoning.19,20 Similarly, physiologically relevant concentrations of codeine range
from approximately 100 to 400 nM,3,21 and postmortem
concentrations around 1 μM have been reported.8 Nonetheless, achieving sufficient selectivity is challenging
due to the large difference in these concentrations and overlapping
voltammetric peaks, especially of UA and MO.

To overcome this
issue, biological matrices are often considerably
diluted and spiked with the target analytes.9−11 Another strategy
is to coat the electrode with a permselective membrane.9,22−25 Nafion is a sulfonated copolymer that has been used extensively
due to its antifouling and cation exchange properties to increase
selectivity and long-term signal stability in electrochemical measurements.23,26 Since both AA and UA exist as anions under physiological conditions,
their interference can be significantly reduced by a Nafion membrane,
as shown in numerous studies.9,23−25 Moreover, the similar structures of MO and CO cause MO peaks to
overlap with CO peaks at carbon electrodes.27−29 However, we
have recently shown that combining a tetrahedral amorphous carbon
(ta-C) electrode with a recast Nafion membrane can not only virtually
eliminate the interference of AA and UA but also increase the selectivity
by eliminating some of the peaks observed for the opioids with the
same functionalities.9 Similarly, a Nafion
membrane has also been shown to alter the detection of morphine by
decreasing the number of peaks observed.30

While the detection of morphine23,29,31−33 and codeine34,35 has been reported by several groups, only a few groups have reported
the simultaneous detection of MO and CO.10,36−38 Even fewer reports can be found on direct and selective
electrochemical detection of MO and CO in the presence of large excess
of both AA and UA.38 Moreover, to the best
of our knowledge, the simultaneous detection of MO and CO has not
been reported with SWCNT or Nafion/SWCNT electrodes. In this paper,
we combine the novel SWCNT network and a Nafion membrane as a dual-layer
electrochemical sensor to achieve the selective detection of MO and
CO. The clinical applicability of the sensor is also evaluated by
demonstrating the simultaneous detection of MO and CO in the presence
of large excess of AA and UA, as well as in human plasma.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Figure 1A shows the
cross-sectional
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Nafion/SWCNT electrode.
The thickness of the coating was analyzed from 121 SEM images over
the full cross section. An average thickness of 1.2 ± 0.5 μm
was found. Because prior X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were unable to reliably detect iron, the SWCNT network was studied
further with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS). Figure 1B shows a typical high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the
iron nanoparticles embedded in the SWCNT network. A lower-magnification
TEM image of the SWCNT network is shown in Figure 1D, where the iron nanoparticles appear dark.
Fast Fourier transform analysis reveals d-spacings
attributed to both metallic iron and likely iron oxides, shown and
assigned in Figure 1C. This assignment was confirmed with EDS analysis that revealed
the presence of C, O, Fe, K, Si, and S (Supporting Information Table S1). Cu was also found, likely originating
from the TEM grid.

(C) fast Fourier transform of the HRTEM image of typical iron nanoparticles,
(D) TEM image of the SWCNT network, and (E) Raman spectra of the SWCNT,
Nafion/SWCNT, and Nafion-coated glass slide. The inset in (E) shows
the radial breathing mode (RBM) region for all samples.

Figure 1E
shows
the Raman spectra of the SWCNT, Nafion/SWCNT, and Nafion on glass,
with the prominent peaks marked.39,40 The samples
containing SWCNT were self-normalized with respect to the G peak intensity,
and the Raman spectrum of the Nafion film was cross-normalized by
the intensity of the G band of the Nafion/SWCNT sample. For the Nafion-coated
glass sample, several peaks were observed. These peaks have been previously
attributed to CF2, CS, COC, SO3–, and CC groups present in Nafion.41

For the pristine SWCNT network, peak fitting resulted in an ID/IG ratio of 0.021,
indicating the presence of only a small number of defects.39 The increase in the intensity and width of the
D peak (1338 cm–1) for the Nafion/SWCNT sample is
likely at least partially due to the overlap of the 1291 cm–1 (CC degenerate stretch) and 1372 cm–1 (CC symmetric
stretch) peaks observed for Nafion. After deconvolution by the fitting
of Lorentzian peaks, an ID/IG ratio of 0.105 was found. Similar changes have been
observed previously for Nafion–CNT composites42 but were attributed to damage during sonication. The G– band peak position is shifted to higher frequencies
(blue shift) when doped with electron-accepting dopants.43 Blue shifts due to the doping of SWCNTs by Nafion
in the range of 2–6 cm–1 have been previously
reported.44,45 This p-doping was attributed to electron
withdrawing of the electron-accepting electronegative CF2 groups and protonation of the SWCNTs by the acidic sulfonic groups.42,44,45 This charge transfer is further
evidenced by a decrease in the intensity of the G– peak and likely also contributes to the change in the ID/IG ratio. Interestingly,
no blue shift was observed for the G+ band, whereas the G′ was blue-shifted by 6 cm–1 as
has been observed previously for p-doping with nitric acid.13

The inset in Figure 1E shows a magnification of the radial breathing
mode (RBM) peaks
of the SWCNT and Nafion/SWCNT samples. The observed RBM bands for
the pristine SWCNT correspond to diameters in the range of 1.2–2.1
nm,46 consistent with the previous work.47 One or two RBM peaks, corresponding to diameters
of 1.3 and 1.6 nm,46 were observed for
the Nafion/SWCNT sample in various randomly selected spots. The appearance
and intensity of RBM depend largely on the match of the laser energy,
as well as the environment and SWCNT (n,m) structure.48 The complete or partial disappearance of the RBM bands
indicates that all or some of the doped SWCNT lost resonant enhancement.
The relatively small changes after Nafion coating could be due to
incomplete Nafion coverage of the SWCNTs. Nevertheless, the observed
changes in the Raman spectra indicate the p-doping of the SWCNT by
the Nafion coating.

2.2 Electrochemistry
2.2.1 Charge Separation of Nafion/SWCNT Electrode
Several
known redox systems, including Ru(NH3)62+/3+, Fe(CN)64–/3–, and
IrCl62–/3–, were used to
study the electrochemical properties of the pristine SWCNT and Nafion/SWCNT
electrodes. Among these, all except Fe(CN)64–/3– are generally considered to be outer-sphere redox probes, whose
electron transfer is independent of surface chemistry, whereas Fe(CN)64–/3– is surface-sensitive.49 The cyclic voltammograms of these measurements
are shown in Figure 2, and Table S2 (Supporting Information)
shows the peak potential separation (ΔEp), as well as oxidation and reduction currents of the used
redox probes at the bare SWCNT and the Nafion/SWCNT electrodes.

Figure 2 Cyclic voltammograms
for SWCNT and SWCNT + Nafion electrodes in
(A) 1 mM Ru(NH3)62+/3+, (B) 1 mM
Fe(CN)64–/3–, and (C) 1 mM IrCl62–/3– in 1 M KCl, as well as (D)
differential pulse voltammogram of 0.5 mM AA and UA in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan rate of 100 mV/s for all
measurements.

As seen from Figure 2A, both the uncoated and the
Nafion-coated SWCNT electrodes show
close to reversible electron transfer for Ru(NH3)62+/3+ with ΔEp values
of 73.1 ± 3.7 mV and 70.7 ± 2.2 mV, respectively. Furthermore,
both the bare and coated electrodes show a diffusion-limited response
in 1 mM Ru(NH3)62+/3+ (see Supporting
Information Figure S1). A small drop in
the redox current and a cathodic shift in the formal potential were
also observed for Ru(NH3)62+/3+ with
the Nafion/SWCNT electrodes. Similar drops in the redox currents and
formal potential have been previously observed for Nafion-coated electrodes.50

The CVs of the negatively charged Fe(CN)64–/3– and IrCl62–/3– are shown in Figure 2B,C, respectively.
The charge exclusion of anions by the Nafion coating is evident, as
the oxidation current was reduced by 97.5% for the former and totally
suppressed for the latter. Moreover, the Nafion coating also caused
an increase in the ΔEp value for
Fe(CN)64–/3– from 95.4 ±
12.1 to 219.4 ± 17.7 mV.

Figure 2D shows
the differential pulse voltammogram of 0.5 mM ascorbic acid and uric
acid in PBS. It can be seen that the Nafion coating suppresses 98.2%
of the AA and UA signals. Without the Nafion coating, the SWCNT electrode
produces a large peak for UA that overlaps with the first oxidation
peak of MO, making selective detection impossible. These results are
in good agreement with the observed charge exclusion of the negatively
charged redox probes (Figure 2B,C) and in line with the previous studies. Kubiak et al.24 observed the permeation of 0.6 and 0.7% for
UA and AA, respectively, in flow injection experiments with an electrode
coated with recast Nafion. In the present study, however, the relative
standard deviation (RSD) of the oxidation current of AA and UA was
37%. This relatively large deviation is likely caused by the large
variation in the thickness of the Nafion. Similar results have also
previously been explained by pinholes extending through the films.51

2.2.2 Effect of Nafion Coating
on Voltammetry
of Morphine and Codeine
Figure 3A,B shows the differential pulse voltammograms
(DPVs) for morphine and codeine for both SWCNT and Nafion/SWCNT electrodes.
The electrochemical oxidation of MO is known to be complex involving
the oxidation of hydroxyl groups at carbons 3 and 6, as well as the
electrochemical demethylation of the aliphatic tertiary amine. The
oxidation peak for morphine, which is most frequently used for determining
MO,23,28,31,33,52 occurs at around +0.4
V and has been previously attributed to the oxidation of the phenolic
group.28 This is followed by chemical reactions
leading to dimerization and formation of pseudomorphine. The peak
occurring at around +0.8 V for MO has been attributed to the oxidation
of the aliphatic tertiary amine. The shoulder observed for this peak
at +0.85 V can be explained by further oxidation of the secondary
aliphatic amine that forms due to reaction with water in aqueous electrolytes.28 Interestingly, this second peak is not as well
defined for codeine. The last observed peak has been previously attributed
to the hydroxyl group at the 6-carbon.

voltammograms for (A) SWCNT and (B) SWCNT + Nafion electrodes and
assignment of the oxidation peaks in 50 μM MO and CO, (C) individual
and simultaneous detection of 10 μM MO and CO in the presence
and absence of 500 μM AA and UA with SWCNT + Nafion electrodes,
and (D) 10 μM MO and CO with accumulation times of (a) 0 s,
(b) 150 s, and (c) 300 s.

For codeine, two peaks close to each other are observed related
to the oxidation of the tertiary amine and the 6-hydroxy group. Codeine
lacks the peak at around +0.4 V as the hydroxyl group at the 3-carbon
is substituted for a methoxy group. For the SWCNT electrode, it is
evident that the MO oxidation peaks for the hydroxyl group at the
6-carbon and that of the amine overlap with those of codeine, possessing
the same amine and 6-carbon hydroxyl functionalities. As can be seen
from Figure 3B,C, the
oxidation peaks likely attributed to the amine are not observed with
the Nafion/SWCNT electrode. It should be noted, however, that there
is a very large variation in the voltammetric responses of MO and
CO in the literature,10,27,28,33,37,53 making reliable assignment of the peaks challenging.
Moreover, voltammetric response with only one peak for MO and CO has
been previously observed with some metal-oxide-based electrodes.10,37 Likewise, Ensafi et al.53 reported similar
voltammetric responses for MO and CO in the ionic liquid N-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate. They also attributed
the observed peaks to the oxidation of hydroxyl groups at carbons
3 and 6 for MO and CO, respectively. We have also recently observed
similar behavior for tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol
at a tetrahedral amorphous carbon electrode coated with Nafion.9 It is well known that electron-withdrawing substituents
increase the oxidation potential of aliphatic tertiary amines.54 Interactions with the Teflon or the sulfonic
groups of the Nafion could cause the observed changes in the voltammetry
of MO and CO. Similar changes to the oxidation potential of the hydroxyl
group at the 6-carbon can, however, not be ruled out without further
research. The Nafion/SWCNT electrode, however, produces a well-defined
peak at +0.44 V related to the oxidation of the phenolic group of
morphine.28 This represents an 80 mV anodic
shift from the uncoated electrode and results in better peak separation
between the residual peak for UA and the MO peak. A second poorly
defined broad peak centered at +0.98 V was also observed, likely due
to the oxidation of the hydroxyl group at carbon 6. Likewise, only
one primary peak was observed for CO at the Nafion/SWCNT electrode.
At lower concentrations, however, two partially overlapping peaks
can be observed for CO at the Nafion/SWCNT electrode, indicating the
existence of two overlapping peaks. It is currently unclear what causes
these changes in the voltammetry of MO and CO and what role the Nafion
coating and its potential p-doping has on the voltammetry of these
opioids. Further work is required to understand why morphine and codeine
behave as they do at Nafion electrodes. To verify the charge selectivity,
DPV measurements were carried out in the absence and presence of 500
μM AA and UA. Figure 3C shows that despite the large variation in the oxidation
current of AA and UA, the oxidation currents of MO and CO changed
only by 3.0 and 6.5%, which are within the electrode-to-electrode
variation of this work. Figure 3C further shows that similar currents are obtained for MO
and CO in the presence and absence of 10 μM of the other opioid,
indicating that the simultaneous detection of MO and CO is possible
without interference.

Although exchange equilibrium between
Nafion and water is rapid
for small cations, larger ions exchange more slowly, and owing to
this kinetic effect, they require longer equilibrium times. Figure 3A,B shows an increase
in the signal of MO and CO with the Nafion/SWCNT electrode compared
to that of the bare SWCNT electrodes with an accumulation time of
300 s, likely due to the preconcentration of morphine and codeine.
For this reason, the effect of the accumulation time was studied.
The results shown in Figure 3D indicate the accumulation of 10 μM MO and CO under
open-circuit conditions. A linear increase in current with increasing
accumulation time was found. The slopes for MO and CO were almost
identical, indicating similar enrichment behavior. Note that similar
behavior was not observed for the uncoated electrodes. The accumulation
time was limited to 300 s for practical reasons and to achieve a measurement
protocol that is rapid in nature.

2.2.3 Simultaneous
Determination of Morphine and
Codeine
Several concentrations of MO in the presence of 10
μM CO and vice versa were measured. Both DPV measurements shown
in Figure 4A,C were
carried out in the presence of 0.5 mM ascorbic acid and uric acid.
The electrode utilized in this work can be seen to measure currents
above the baseline for 50 nM MO and 100 nM CO. For MO, there were
two linear relations with different slopes. In the low-concentration
range (0.05–1 μM), a linear regression equation of IPa(μA) = 0.0859CMO + 0.1430 (R2 = 0.9992) was obtained.
In the higher-concentration range (1–10 μM), the electrodes
showed a second linear regression equation of IPa(μA) = 0.0500CMO + 0.1994
(R2 = 0.9885). Other works have also reported
two linear ranges for morphine.31,52 It could be that higher
concentrations cause saturation of the available surface sites for
the electrochemical oxidation of morphine. It is also possible that
prolonged measurements with many concentrations cause some fouling
and passivation of the electrode. After 10 μM, the slope deviated
from the linear relationship, likely due to the passivation of the
electrode surface. For codeine, only one linear range IPa(μA) = 0.0848CCO +
0.7513 (R2 = 0.9998) was found (0.1–50
μM). The relatively narrow linear ranges seem to be typical
of many electrode materials for morphine.31,33

Based on the sensitivities
and the standard deviation of the current
in three consecutive measurements in blank solutions, limits of detection
(LOD) were calculated. LODs of 0.071 and 0.277 μM for MO and
CO, respectively, were obtained. These detection limits represent
clinically relevant concentrations of MO and CO.

As shown in Table 1, lower detection
limits have been achieved for individual detection
of MO and CO in the presence of AA and UA. Švorc et al.35 reported the selective detection of CO alone
in the presence of AA and UA. Similarly, the selective detection of
MO in the presence of AA and UA has been reported with the use of
surfactants31 and medium exchange.29 Atta et al.23 also
reported increased selectivity at a Nafion-based electrode in large
excess of UA. However, the concentration difference between MO and
AA and UA was considerably smaller than in the present work. Moreover,
there is no evidence that these electrodes would be capable of simultaneous
detection of MO and CO.

a Caused interference

Lower detection limits
have also been observed for the simultaneous
detection of MO and CO at various metal-based electrode platforms
(Table 1). These studies,
however, did not investigate the interference of AA and UA or reported
interference in large excess of AA and UA.37 As a result, these electrodes have to rely on considerable dilution
and spiking of real samples to avoid matrix effects. Simultaneous
detection of MO and CO has also been reported in 1000-fold excess
of AA and UA, individually. The reported detection mechanism is, however,
based on a more complicated DNA functionalized biosensor with electrochemical
detection.38

While the current of
the UA and AA peaks showed a considerable
relative standard deviation (RSD) of 37% from electrode to electrode
(n = 6), satisfactory RSD values of 7.3 and 13.9%
(n = 3) for MO and CO, respectively, were achieved.
These relatively large variations are likely due to the variation
in the thickness of the Nafion coating or pinholes extending through
the film. The performance of the electrode can likely be improved
by further development of the Nafion deposition process.

2.2.4 Measurement of Morphine and Codeine in Plasma
To verify
the applicability of the developed electrode in real
samples, DPV measurements were carried out in human plasma, diluted
two times with PBS. Figure 5A shows the blank scan in plasma and after spiking with increasing
amounts of MO and CO. The oxidation currents scaled linearly with
the concentration in the range of 1–5 μM for MO and 1–10
μM for CO. The background currents in blank plasma show virtually
no matrix effect for MO, whereas the background current is slightly
increased for CO. It should be noted that no precipitation of proteins
was carried out before measurements. All comparable studies in Table 1 precipitated the
proteins and diluted their samples at least 5-fold. Moreover, none
of the studies have assessed the effects of drug plasma protein binding
on the detection capabilities of the electrodes. In this work, recoveries
based on the sensitivities in the linear range were 61.4 and 41.5%
for MO and CO, respectively. The RSD values for MO and CO were 13
and 10%, respectively, comparable to those measured in large excess
of AA and UA.

ranges of the measurements with standard deviations as error bars
(n = 5). Accumulation time 5 min.

Unbound fractions of 53–68% for MO and 44% for CO
have been
reported in previous studies.55−57 Despite large variations between
the few available studies, the comparison of the unbound fractions
with the recovery percentages in our study (61.4% for MO and 41.5%
for CO) suggests that the electrode may, in fact, be measuring the
clinically interesting free fraction of MO and CO in plasma.

To verify that the lower recoveries are not due to rapid passivation
of the electrode or blocking of the ionic channels of the Nafion film,
two electrodes were measured for three consecutive times in plasma
with 10 μM MO and CO. The RSDs for these measurements were 2.7
and 4.2% for MO and CO, respectively, indicating no further passivation
of the electrode. A further passivation study with Ru(NH3)62+/3+ in PBS and the diluted human plasma
was also carried out. No meaningful difference was observed in the
redox currents in the CV measurements of 1 mM Ru(NH3)62+/3+ in PBS and diluted human plasma shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. While
there may be adsorption of proteins on the surface of the electrode,
there seems to be no apparent blocking of the ionic channels of the
Nafion coating. It should be noted that these results do not completely
rule out the possibility of fouling of the active sites of inner-sphere
analytes, such as MO and CO, as a cause for the reduced recoveries.
More studies with a wider range of analytes with and without protein
precipitation combined with equilibrium dialysis are required to fully
understand these plasma measurements.

Nonetheless, these measurements
show that it is possible to measure
close to therapeutic concentrations of MO and CO without considerable
dilution of the plasma or precipitation of the proteins. Despite these
interesting results, the large electrode-to-electrode variation in
the CO oxidation current makes the measurement of CO with concentrations
below 2.5 μM challenging. This is likely due to both the lower
sensitivity toward CO and the low recovery, presumably due to the
high protein-bound fraction of CO. These challenges could, however,
be at least partially overcome with further optimization of the multilayer
electrode and by spiking of the supporting electrolyte, as is commonly
done in many analysis methods.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we fabricated disposable dual-layer SWCNT/Nafion
electrodes. We showed that SWCNT network electrodes could be easily
fabricated through a simple dry transfer method and coated with Nafion
through dip-coating. The Nafion coating was shown to alter the voltammetry
of MO and CO, enabling their simultaneous detection. In addition,
the fabricated electrode showed charge exclusion of anions and enrichment
of MO and CO. These properties make nanomolar detection of MO and
CO possible in large excess of AA and UA. Simultaneous detection of
MO and CO close to physiologically relevant concentrations was also
achieved in the presence of AA and UA, as well as in human plasma
with only mild dilution without the precipitation of proteins. Recoveries
closely matching those previously reported for unbound fractions of
MO and CO were obtained in human plasma.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Synthesis
SWCNTs were synthesized by thermal high-temperature floating catalyst
chemical vapor deposition. The process is described in greater detail
in refs (13) and (58). In this process, iron
nanoparticles are formed through thermal decomposition of ferrocene
in a carbon monoxide atmosphere. The iron nanoparticles catalyze the
decomposition of carbon monoxide, leading to nucleation and growth
of SWCNT in the gas phase inside a quartz laminar flow reactor. The
formed SWCNTs form bundles in gas phase59 and are collected on nitrocellulose membranes.

4.2 Electrode Fabrication
The SWCNT networks
were press-transferred onto glass (Thermo Scientific, ISO 8037-1)
and densified. The room-temperature press-transfer process is described
in detail in refs (13) and (14). Briefly,
the glass was precleaved to 1 × 2 cm2 pieces and cleaned
by sonication in acetone (AnalaR NORMAPUR, Merck). After cleaning,
the pieces were blown by nitrogen. The filters with the SWCNT networks
were cut and placed on the glass pieces with the SWCNT side down and
pressed between two glass slides. After carefully peeling off the
filter backing, the adhered SWCNT network was densified with a few
drops of ethanol as in ref (13) and baked at 70 °C for 3 min.

Silver contact
pads were prepared with conductive silver paint (Electrolube). The
silver was dried at room temperature for 15 min and baked on a hot
plate preheated to 60 °C for 3 min. The electrode was then covered
with a PTFE film (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics CHR 2255-2) with
a 3 mm hole. Finally, the electrode was dip-coated by immersing the
electrode for 5 s in 5 wt % Nafion 117 solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Before
measurements, the electrode was allowed to dry under ambient conditions
overnight. A scheme of the step-by-step electrode fabrication is shown
in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Characterization
The SWCNT networks
grown under the same conditions have been characterized in previous
work by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy
(AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS).14,47 Based on TEM and AFM analyses,
bundle sizes of 3–20 nm were found. The XPS survey spectrum
of the SWCNT networks press-transferred onto oxidized Si wafer showed
peaks for silicon, oxygen, and carbon. More detailed TEM investigations
were performed in the present study by an FEI Tecnai F-20 TEM at a
200 kV acceleration voltage. Specimens were prepared by press-transferring
the SWCNT network directly onto M75 copper-only TEM grids (Agar).
Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was also performed in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) mode on multiple 6.5 ×
6.5 μm2 areas (n = 7).

Cross-sectional
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) samples were prepared by cleaving
Nafion/SWCNT electrodes. Prior to cleaving, the electrodes were cooled
in liquid nitrogen. Before imaging, the cross section was coated with
2 nm Au by sputtering (Leica EM SCD050). The thickness of the Nafion
membrane was measured from the cross-sectional SEM images obtained
with an S-4700 SEM (Hitachi). Visible Raman spectroscopy was performed
with a LabRAM HR (Jobin Yvon Horiba) confocal Raman system. An argon
laser with λ = 514 nm (power 10 mW) and BX41 (Olympus) microscope
with a 100× objective (spot size of less than 1 μm) was
used.

4.4 Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were carried
out with a CH Instrument (CHI630E) potentiostat. A three-electrode
cell was used for all electrochemical measurements with a Ag/AgCl
electrode as reference (+0.199 V vs SHE, Radiometer Analytical) and
a Pt wire as the counter electrode. All chemicals were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, unless stated otherwise. Morphine hydrochloride and
codeine hydrochloride were obtained from the University Pharmacy,
Helsinki, Finland.

The electrochemical properties of SWCNT and
Nafion/SWCNT electrodes were studied with hexaammineruthenium(III)chloride,
potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), and potassium hexachloroiridate(IV)
redox probes. Solutions with concentrations of 1 mM of each probe
were prepared in 1 M KCl (Merck Suprapur). Both electrode types were
measured with each redox probe with several scan rates at room temperature.
Solutions of 500 μM l-ascorbic acid and 500 μM
uric acid were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
with pH 7.4. Stock solutions of 1 mM of MO and CO were also prepared
in PBS and injected into the cell to achieve increasing concentrations.
All DPV measurements were conducted with a pulse amplitude of 50 mV
and a scan rate of 20 mV/s. The electrodes were placed in blank PBS
solutions between measurements. Prior to all, except for the plasma
measurements, the solutions were deoxygenated with nitrogen for at
least 5 min, and the cell was blanketed throughout the measurements.

For the plasma measurements, expired human plasma (Octaplas AB,
Sweden) was received from the blood center of HUSLAB (Finland). Plasma
(5 mL) was diluted with 5 mL of PBS and measured without further processing.
Equal additions of MO and CO stock solutions were injected into the
cell to achieve concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM. DPVs
were measured with an accumulation time of 5 min and a 5 min washout
in PBS between each concentration. Hexaammineruthenium(III)chloride
(1 mM) was also measured with CV in both diluted plasma and PBS to
study the passivation of the electrode.
