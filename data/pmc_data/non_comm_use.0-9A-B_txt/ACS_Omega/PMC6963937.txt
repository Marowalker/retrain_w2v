The current review describes the recent progress in the
chemistry
and biology of the benzhydryl amines where the central carbon atom
is directly attached to the nitrogen atom of one ring and which have
published in the last five years (2015–2019). Both metal and
metal-free racemic and asymmetric synthetic approaches along with

Introduction
Benzhydryl amines, broadly belonging to
Triarylmethanes (TRAMs)
or Trisubstituted Methanes (TRSMs), are privileged architectural patterns
where the central sp3-hybridized methine atom is attached
to three similar or different types of groups. Depending on the type
of substitution attached, these benzhydryl amines could be symmetrically
or asymmetrically substituted. Due to their distinctive chemical as
well as pharmaceutical properties, they have gained conspicuous attention
in organic chemistry (Figure-1).

Figure 1 Symmetrically and unsymmetrically substituted TRSMs.

The triarylmethanes or trisubstituted methanes
play an important
role in dyes, pharmaceutical chemistry, materials science, as well
as in organic synthesis. They have shown activity against intestinal
helminthes, filariae, trichomonads, as well as trypanosomes. Their
hydroxy analogs exhibit antioxidant and antitumor activities and also
inhibit many protein kinases. Some of the important triaryl methanes
like malachite green, crystal violet, sunset orange, pararosanilin,
and victoria blue are used in dye industry. The ortho-substituted
triarylmethanes showed chiral helical conformation and find uses in
theoretical and conformational studies. The electron and π-electron
donor properties come from the sulfur atom and heteroaromatic rings
of trithienylmethanes, respectively. Moreover, the trityl group originating
from triarylmethanes has versatile uses as a protecting group in carbohydrate,
peptide, and nucleoside chemistry due to the stability of the carbocations.
However, triarylmethanols are used as chiral catalysts in diverse
organic transformations like Mukaiyama aldol reactions and allylations
of the aldehydes with allyl tributyl stannane.

Diarylmethylamine
units are widely found in various biologically
active compounds like anticancer, anti-tubercular, antimalarial, antiviral,
potent and selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs), and
anti-HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) agents. Though such compounds have wide
areas of applicability, to the best of our knowledge the synthesis
and biomedical perspectives of benzhydryl amines have not been reviewed.
We will discuss the synthesis and the biomedical application of benzhydryl
amines in the pharmaceutical area from 2015–2019, leaving behind
the reports that have already been published in the previous reviews.1

Results and Discussion
1 Synthesis of Benzhydryl Amines
Due
to the flexibility of TRSMs in diverse areas of research, synthetic
organic chemists have become interested in synthesizing benzhydryl
amines, a class of TRSMs utilizing diverse types of routes. In this
review, we have categorized and discussed several approaches for the
synthesis of diaryl methyl amine scaffold which will allow the readers
to gain an impression of the different synthetic routes to access
them, which have been categorized into the following classes:

1.1. Metal catalyzed reactions for the synthesis of benzhydryl amines

1.2. Multicomponent reactions (MCR)

1.2.a. Noble metal nanoparticles
catalyzed MCRs

1.2.b. Metal free MCRs

1.3. Enantioselective
synthesis of benzhydryl amines

1.3.a. Organocatalyzed enantioselective
synthesis

1.3.b. Metal catalyzed enantioselective synthesis

1.4. Miscellaneous methods

1.1 Metal Catalyzed Reactions for the Synthesis
of Benzhydryl Amines
Sakai et al. in 2015 reported a coupling
reaction of aryl boronic acids (1) with N,O-acetals (2) and N,N-aminals
(3) with copper(I) as catalyst leading to the formation of α-aryl
glycines (4) and diarylmethylamines (10) (Scheme 1).2 The authors
observed that this catalyst successfully activated both the C(sp3)-O bond of N,O-acetals as well as the C(sp3)-N
bond of N,N-aminals, but in the absence of any coordinating substituent,
the C(sp3)-O bond of the N,O-acetal particularly gets activated.

Scheme 1 Copper(I)-Catalyzed Coupling Reaction of Aryl Boronic Acids with
N,O-Acetals and N,N-Animals
Nambo et al. in 2018 reported a novel route
for desulfonylative
transformation for benzhydryl amines (8) from the reaction between
easily available sulfones (6) and amines (7) using copper chloride
as a catalyst (Scheme 2).3

Scheme 2 Cu-Catalyzed Desulfonylative Amination
for the Synthesis of Diaryl
Methyl Amines
They found that the desulfonylative amination
catalyzed by Cu furnishes
structurally varying benzhydryl amines in reasonable yields as well
as provides iterative and intramolecular aminations (Scheme 3). From several control experiments,
authors observed that the reaction proceeds through generation of
a Cu-carbene complex derived from stable sulfone derivatives.

Scheme 3 Iterative and Intramolecular Aminations
In 2018, Ide et al. published a novel approach
for the regio- and
chemoselective Csp3–H arylation of benzylamines
(9) by employing single electron transfer (SET)/hydrogen atom transfer
(HAT) synergistic catalysis using Ir(ppy)3 as a photoredox
catalyst (Scheme 4).4 Interestingly, it was found that the reaction
occurred at the N-methyl and/or cyclic N-methylene positions through an aminium radical cation intermediate
under SET catalysis only, whereas in contrast, synergistic SET and
HAT catalysis reversed the regioselectivity. The reaction was finished
within a very short time with 0.5 mol % of the Ir complex and 1 mol
% of PhC(O)SH as a HAT catalyst, and diverse 1,1-diarylmethylamines
(10) were synthesized in reasonable to excellent yields (56–98%).
From a mechanistic point of view, the role of PhC(O)SH as a HAT catalyst
is delineated like this: Favorable oxidation of PhC(O)SK has effectively
stopped SET oxidation of the tertiary amines and the C–H bonds
was selectively abstracted by the resulting sulfur radical to give
N-benzyl radicals.

Regio- and
Chemoselective C–H Arylation
1.2 Multicomponent Reactions (MCR) for the Synthesis
of Benzhydryl Amines
1.2.a Noble Metal Nanoparticle Catalyzed MCRs
Noble metal nanoparticles have huge potential for application as
catalysts. In 2015, Kulkarni et al. indicated cobalt ferrite nanoparticles
catalyzed a three-component Petasis–Borono–Mannich reaction
between aryl boronic acids (11), salicylaldehydes (12), and secondary
amines (13) to furnish alkylaminophenols (14) within a very short
time period (Scheme 5).5 Surprisingly, the catalyst (CoFe2O4, NPS) could be recycled and reused up to five
consecutive cycles without appreciable loss in its activity, thus
further demonstrating the importance of the methodology.

Scheme 5 (CoFe2O4, NPS) Catalyzed Petasis–Borono–Mannich
(PBM) Reaction
Later on, in 2018 Fathalipour et al. developed
a solvent-free one-pot
approach for the synthesis of 1-(α-amino alkyl)-2-naphthols
(18) using biocompatible, reduced modified graphene oxide (rMGO)-Au
NPs as catalyst (Scheme 6).6 Noble metal nanoparticles were synthesized
by the reduction of Au(III) complex by sodium citrate with the use
of covalent modified graphene oxide and diacid polyethylene glycol.
Catalyst recyclability, reasonable yield, short reaction times, and
easy workup procedure and purification are the salient features of
the reaction.

Scheme 6 rMGO-Au NPs Catalyzed Betti Reaction
1.2.b Metal-Free MCRs
In 2015, Reddy
et al. reported a green approach for the synthesis of alkylaminophenols
(19) using Chitosan as a biopolymer catalyst via a three-component
Petasis borono-Mannich reaction in very good to excellent yield (Scheme 7).7 Short reaction time, no purification, and recycled and
reusable catalyst are the key features of this approach.

Scheme 7 Chitosan-Catalyzed
Three-Component PBM Reactions
In 2016, Azizi and co-workers developed a green,
one-pot approach
for the synthesis of alkylaminophenols (20) in biodegradable choline-chloride-based
deep eutectic solvent in very good to excellent yield (Scheme 8).8 They prepared the catalyst by refluxing urea and choline chloride
at 60 °C. Deep eutectic solvent (DES) could be readily recycled
at least four times without loss of catalytic activity.

Scheme 8 DES Catalyzed
MCR for the Synthesis of Betti Bases
In 2017, Teimuri-Mofrad et al. reported a multicomponent
reaction
between aldehydes, amines, and 2-naphthol with nano-SiO2-H3BO3 as catalyst for the synthesis of Betti
bases (21) under solvent-free conditions (Scheme 9).9 Nano-SiO2-H3BO3 catalyst was generated by mixing
nanosilica and H3BO3 in ethanol, and the recovered
catalyst was reused for four catalytic cycles without loss of any
efficacy.

Scheme 9 H3BO3-nano-SiO2 Catalyzed
the Direct
Synthesis of Aminonaphthols
In 2018, Rekunge et al. reported a cost-effective,
solvent-free,
green protocol for the synthesis of 1-(amido/amino) alkyl-2-naphthols
(22) using activated Fuller’s earth as a heterogeneous reusable
catalyst via multicomponent reaction of an aldehyde, 2-naphthol or
phenol, and amides or amines with excellent to good yields (Scheme 10).10

Scheme 10 Activated Fuller’s Earth Catalyzed MCR
Afterward, in 2018 Patil et al. (same group)
reported an expeditious,
practical, and environmentally benign approach for the synthesis of
Betti bases (1-aminoalkyl-2-phenols) (23) via a multicomponent reaction
using sulfated polyborate catalyst under solvent-free conditions (Scheme 11).11 The catalyst was prepared by dehydration of boric acid
followed by sulfonation, and the recovered catalyst was reused up
to four times without loss of any catalytic activity.

Scheme 11 Sulfated
Polyborate Catalyzed One-Pot Three-Component Reactions for
the Synthesis of Betti Bases
In 2019, our group described a base-mediated
1,6-conjugate addition
of heterocyclic amines and amides (25) to substituted para-quinone methides (24) to give unsymmetrical benzhydryl amine (26)
in moderate to very good yields (up to 83%) in one pot (Scheme 12).12 This methodology could further be elaborated for the synthesis
of the biologically important first-generation antihistamines meclizine,
hydroxyzine, and cetirizine like scaffolds, highlighting the utility
of the work.

Scheme 12 Base-Mediated 1,6-Conjugate Addition to p-QMs
1.3 Enatioselective Synthesis of Benzhydryl Amines
Benzhydryl amines belong to an significant class of chiral hydrocarbons
having diverse medicinal properties. In today’s drug discovery
process, chirality and activity derived from single enantiomer play
important roles. Thus, developing new asymmetric methods for chiral
diarylmethylamine will be very challenging. Despite having a variety
of racemic routes, enantioselective or enantiospecific methods to
this important class of chiral molecule are very scarce.

1.3.a Organocatalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis
In 2017, the Sun group observed a new organocatalytic method for
the efficient N-alkylation of indoles (28) and carbazoles via in situ generated aza-para-quinone methides
using SPINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acid catalyst (27) (Scheme 13).13 From control experiments, it was established that chiral
acid catalyst acts as a promoter for in situ formation
of the crucial aza-para-quinone methide intermediate
and a bifunctional catalyst in the upcoming enantio-determining step.

Scheme 13 SPINOL-Derived Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed 1,6-Conjugate Addition
Later on, in 2018 Okamoto and co-workers demonstrated
a regio-
and enantioselective aza-Friedel–Crafts reaction of phenols
(30) with aldimines (29) using BINOL-derived chiral pyrophosphoric
acid catalyst (31) for the synthesis of diarylcarbamate derivatives
(32) (Scheme 14).14ortho/para-Directing phenols could react at a para-position
with moderate to good enantioselectivity. The Sakakura group further
extended this methodology for the enantioselective synthesis (R)-bifonazole.

Scheme 14 BINOL-Derived Chiral Pyrophosphoric Acid
Catalyzed aza-Friedel–Crafts
Reaction
1.3.b Metal-Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis
In 2015, Wang et al. demonstrated a highly enantioselective pinacolboryl
addition of N-Boc-imines (33) using a chiral sulfoxide-dialkylphosphine
(SOP) as ligand (34) and copper(I) as catalyst to form enantio-enriched
N-Boc-α-amino boronic compounds (35) (Scheme 15).15 They next
explored the synthetic utility of enantio-enriched N-Boc-α-amino
boronic esters and presented a new route to the synthesis of antihistamine
(R)-cetirizine (Zyrtec).

Scheme 15 Copper(I)-Catalyzed
Asymmetric Pinacolboryl Addition
In 2017, Syu et al. developed Rh(I)-catalyzed
enantioselective
addition of arylboronic acids to N-diphenylphosphinyl
(N-DPP)-protected aldimines (36) using chiral bicycle [2.2.1] heptadiene
ligands (37) bearing aryl and secondary amido groups to furnish optically
active N-DPP protected amines (38) with 31–99% yields and up
to 91–99% ee (Scheme 16).16 They have designed and synthesized
the ligand. This protocol was also extended to access antifungal agent,
bifonazole.

Scheme 16 Rh(I)-Catalyzed Enantioselective Arylation
In 2018, Jiang et al. reported iridium-catalyzed
asymmetric (4
+ 3) cyclization of vinyl aziridines (39) with ortho-hydroxy-substituted para-quinone methides (40)
for seven-membered benzoxazepine scaffolds (42) in good to outstanding
yields (40% to 96%) and moderate diastereoselectivities (73:27 to
91:9 dr) and high enantioselectivities (92:8 to 96:4 ee) using a chiral
ligand (41) (Scheme 17).17

Scheme 17 Iridium Catalyzed Asymmetric (4 +
3) Cyclization
1.4 Miscellaneous Method
In 2015, Borukhova
et al. reported a simplification and acceleration of chemical reactions
to make meclizine, commercially available cyclizine and cinnarizine,
and a buclizine derivative from diphenylmethanol using microflow technology.18

2 Biomedical Application of Benzhydryl Amines
In the last couple of decades, there has been a thunder in the
utilization of diarylmethylamine derivatives in the biomedical field.
The diarylmethylamine derivatives displays diverse bioactivities like
as anticancer, anti-muscarinic, antimalarial, and antiviral and antihistamine
agents. We will be covering the biomedical applications of diarylmethylamine
derivatives that were reported during 2015–2019.

2.1 Diarylmethylamine Derivatives as Potent Aromatase
Inhibitors
In 2016, Ghodsi et al. reported diarylalkylimidazole
and diarylalkyltriazole derivatives as potent aromatase inhibitors
based on Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis
(Figure 2).19 Their study indicated that lipophilicity can
be one of the effective factors for the strong binding to aromatase.
SAR study confirmed that with the replacement of the imidazole group
by a triazole moiety, in vitro inhibition was reduced
and activity was increased in vivo because of enhanced
metabolic stability of the triazole derivatives.

Figure 2 Structure of diarylalkylimidazole
and diarylalkyltriazole derivatives.

2.2 Diarylmethylamine Derivatives as Antibacterial
Agents
In a study directed toward developing new and selective
agents with potential utility in the treatment of antibacterial activity
against Gram-positive pathogens and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a series of 1-aminoalkylated
2-naphthols was prepared by Roman and co-workers in 2016 (Figure 3).20 All of the Mannich bases having a thiophen-2-yl ring in
their structure showed good activity against Gram-positive bacteria,
without consideration of the nature of the amino moiety by SAR analysis.

Figure 3 1-Aminoalkylated
2-naphthol derivatives as antibacterial agents.

2.3 Diarylmethylamine Derivatives as Antiviral
Agents
In 2016, He et al. reported a structural modification
study that furnished optimized, achiral, well-tolerated Chlorcyclizine
analogues with advanced anti-HCV potency and good pharmacokinetic
properties in the liver at very reasonable doses (Figure 4).21 From SAR study, they concluded that hydroxyl or amino groups at
the chain terminal position of chlorcyclizine derivatives showed high
anti-HCV activity and moderate cytotoxicity. Removal of the para-chloro substituent reduced the activity and introduction
of an extra para-chloro substituent in the other
ring marginally increased the activity. Next, structural modifications
to the piperazine core expressed that compounds having one carbon
extension of the piperazine ring maintained the activity but led to
increased cytotoxicity. The swap of the piperazine ring with other
rings led to a remarkable loss of activity.

Figure 4 Chlorcyclizine analogues
as antiviral agents.

Later on, in 2018 Schafer et al. suggested that
first-generation
antihistamines as excellent postulants can be repurposed as antifilovirus
therapeutics and can be further optimized for removal of unwanted
histamine or muscarinic receptor interactions without loss of antifilovirus
efficacy. They reported that among all zinc related antihistamines,
chlorcyclizine (Ahist) could be a potential candidate for repurposing
as an antifilovirus agent in both human immortalized cell lines and
human primary cells (Figure 5).22 Docking studies proved the
potential for these drugs to bind directly to the Ebola virus-glycoproteins
(EBOV-GP) at the same site as toremifene. SAR studies disclosed that
loss of the chlorine group (Cyclizine) led to a notable depletion
in Marburg virus (MARV) inhibition but not EBOV inhibition, and bulky
substitutions at the terminal amine group (buclizine and meclizine)
generally led to a diminution in efficacy against both EBOV and MARV
inhibitions.

Figure 5 Piperazine based diarylmethylamines as antiviral agents.

2.4 Diarylmethylamine Derivatives as Anti-Leishmanial
Agents
In 2019, Mendes et al. reported that the H1-antihistamines
cinnarizine and meclizine could be explored as new routes of cellular
death in the parasite, and the determination of molecular target would
contribute to understanding the potential of these drugs as anti-leishmanial
agents. However, cetirizine failed to show significant anti-leishmanial
activity (Figure 6).23 Cinnarizine and meclizine showed activity against
promastigotes as well as intracellular amastigotes with IC50 values 10–29 μM and 20–35 μM.

Figure 6 Piperazine
based diarylmethylamines as anti-leishmanials.

2.5 Miscellaneous Bioactivities of Compounds Containing
Diarylmethylamine Core
A considerable amount of research
has been carried out over the past few years aimed at the preparation
of a new drug of different activity based on the analogues of meclizine.

Foo et al. reported meclizine, a pregnane X receptor agonist, directly
inhibited testosterone 6β-hydroxylation catalyzed by human liver
microsomes, recombinant CYP3A4, and recombinant CYP3A5 (Figure 7).24 Meclizine inhibited human liver microsomal testosterone 6β-hydroxylation
by a mixed mode and with an apparent Ki of 31 ± 6 μM. The authors concluded that meclizine inhibited
human CYP3A enzymes by both direct inhibition and mechanism-based
inactivation, but norchlorcyclizine is a direct inhibitor but not
a mechanism-based inactivator.

Figure 7 Meclizine as a versatile therapeutic agent.

In 2016, Gorgun et al. observed in the mitochondria-rich
dorsal
root ganglion (DRG) neurons that meclizine reduces cisplatin-induced
mitochondrial compromise via elevation of the pentose phosphate pathway
and repletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
and glutathione stores (Figure 7).25 The authors also proposed
that Meclizine-mediated preservation of redox balance sustains mitochondrial
respiration, which supports execution of cellular processes, including
timely removal of cisplatin cross-links from nuclear DNA, thereby
attenuating cisplatin toxicity in the DRG neuron.

Later on,
in 2017 Guo et al. reported that meclizine has a remarkable
inhibitory effect on osteoclastogenesis and ovariectomy-induced bone
loss. In vitro and in vivo study
revealed that meclizine prevents osteoclastogenesis via regulation
of several receptor activators of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)
signaling pathways, and Pregnane X receptor (PXR) was involved in
the processes (Figure 7).26

Recently, Husseiny et al. investigated in vitro/in vivo study of meclizine floating
microspheres
to control nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (Figure 7).27 They have prepared meclizine floating microspheres by an emulsion
solvent evaporation method and characterized them as well. Pharmacokinetic
studies confirmed that the optimized formula of meclizine floating
microsphere could attain prolonged and/or controlled release, in tandem
with exhibiting enhanced systemic bioavailability, compared to the
plain drug.

In 2018, Durham et al. determined the effectiveness
and safety
of cetirizine compared with diphenhydramine for the prevention of
chemotherapy-related infusion like flushing, itching, alterations
in heart rate and blood pressure, etc.28 They will establish the role of cetirizine and discuss its adverse
effect profile in comparison with diphenhydramine in the future with
various studies.

Future Perspective
While there are plenty of literature
reports on the synthesis of
racemic and asymmetric triarylmethanes and trisubstituted methanes,
the articles originating from benzhydryl amines, a class of TRSM,
are scarce. Careful analysis of the nitrogen part of TRSM reveals
that mostly acyclic and cyclic aliphatic and aromatic nucleophiles
with nitrogen have been used for synthesis of a large variety of this
class of molecule. In some cases, their asymmetric versions originating
from the central methine atom are also reported. Among the abundant
chiral natural products containing nitrogen are amino acids where
the nitrogen group can be utilized as a suitable nucleophile for the
construction of a large array of benzhydryl amines having already
built-in chirality and providing an ample scope of generation of a
mixture of diastereomers which may exhibit specific biological properties.
Moreover, a large number of amino acids with fixed absolute configuration
and variety of functional groups will give a fine balance of hydrophobicity
and hydrophilicity among the synthesized benzhydryl amines.

Conclusion
The current review discusses the recent
developments in the chemistry
and biology of the benzhydryl amine derivatives that has been reported
in the last five years (2015–2019) and hence can be a thrust
for the further elaboration of this family of molecules toward small
molecules as therapeutic agents. The significant advantage of this
class of molecules has created a high insistence for their effective
synthesis and thus led to various improvements in synthetic organic
chemistry.
