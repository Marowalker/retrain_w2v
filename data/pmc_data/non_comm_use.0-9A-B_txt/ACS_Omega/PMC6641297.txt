Terahertz
(THz) wave detectors are increasingly expected to serve
as key components of powerful nondestructive and noncontact inspection
tools in a large variety of fields. In contrast to conventional THz
detectors based on rigid solid materials, we previously developed
an uncooled and bendable THz camera based on the THz-induced photothermoelectric
effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) array devices and demonstrated omnidirectional
THz imaging of three-dimensional curved samples. Although this development
opened a pathway to flexible THz electronics, the physical parameters
that determine the performance of the CNT THz camera have not been
fully investigated. As a result, the thermal device design has not
been optimized in terms of the camera sensitivity and spatial resolution.
In this work, we studied the underlying mechanism of the THz-induced
photothermoelectric effect of the CNT camera and found physical factors
related to the detector performance. Through simulation and experiments,
we observed that the detection sensitivity and response time strongly
depend on the CNT channel width and film thickness. We further identified
that the irradiated wave penetration into the CNT film through the
electrode materials deteriorates the detection area, which is directly
linked to the camera spatial resolution. By utilizing the improved
CNT device design fabricated based on these findings, we eliminated
undesired signals generated via thermal diffusion and THz wave penetration
and achieved higher-sensitivity THz detection and higher imaging resolution
compared to our previously reported THz camera. The presented technologies
are expected to contribute to future flexible THz imaging applications
and will also be applicable to other types of photothermoelectric
devices.

Introduction
Visualization is one
of the most powerful measurement schemes and
is applicable to a large variety of fields, including medical care,
security screening, and materials and biological research.1−6 Along with ultrasound scan,7,8 infrared spectroscopy,9,10 X-ray examination,11,12 and so forth, the terahertz (THz)
imaging technology has attracted increasingly considerable attention
because of its ability to penetrate nonpolarized objects and because
of the fingerprint spectra of many materials and molecules lying in
this frequency region.13−15 As a nondestructive and noncontact inspection tool,
THz imaging can thus be powerfully employed for the characterization
of organic/inorganic materials, pharmaceutical quality control, and
agricultural, medical, and biological examinations. To practically
utilize THz imaging techniques for industrial and medical applications,
high-speed (real-time) visualization of objects is inevitably required.
This issue can be resolved by arraying multiple THz detectors in a
one- or two-dimensional configuration. In contrast to technically
mature frequency regions, such as visible light and microwave, the
development of cameras in the THz region remains a challenge; however,
several types of THz camera devices have been reported.16,17 In particular, one difficulty of existing THz cameras is their substantially
rigid unbendable structure, which primarily limited their use to flat
samples; however, surfaces of most real samples have three-dimensional
curvatures. This restricts the adaptable range of THz imaging measurements.

The high thermoelectric properties of carbon nanotube (CNT) films
are expected to lead to high-performance thermal THz detectors because
of their large Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity,
mechanical strength, and high absorption ratios over a broad frequency
range from the subTHz to ultraviolet regions. By utilizing macroscopically
bendable CNT films,18−21 we recently developed flexible THz cameras based on multiarray CNT
devices and demonstrated 360° multiview THz imaging of bent samples,
such as syringes and PET bottles.22 This
unique THz camera has thus eliminated the need for bulky components
required for three-dimensional surface imaging, such as THz tomography
techniques. Although our technology potentially expands the applications
of THz imaging, the physical parameters that govern the detection
mechanism have not been clarified in detail, and the sensitivity and
the spatial resolution of the CNT THz camera can be much improved
in terms of the thermal device design.

In this work, through
simulations and experiments, we examined
the underlying mechanism behind the THz-induced photothermoelectric
effect and determined parameters that primarily govern the detector
performance, such as the sensitivity and response speed. We also observed
that the irradiated wave penetration through electrode materials affects
the spatial resolution of the CNT THz camera and accordingly suggested
an improved device design for sufficiently suppressing wave penetration.
On the basis of all these findings, we fabricated a refined structure
of the CNT THz camera and enhanced the sensitivity and spatial resolution.
The presented thermal design is a general feature of the photothermoelectric
properties of the CNT film and, along with the THz camera, can be
utilized in a variety of CNT-based photothermoelectric applications,
such as optically activated energy harvesters.

Results and Discussion
We employed CNT films formed through a filtration process (Figure 1a). A CNT solution
was deposited on a cellulose membrane filter and was vacuumed until
the CNT solution was fully filtered (typically over several hours).
Then, the film was dried, and the CNT film was picked up by using
tweezers. As shown in Figure 1a,b, the CNT film can be easily bent and almost totally absorbs
the THz wave over 99%. The mechanical strength and high absorption
from subTHz to several THz frequency region indicates that the CNT
films are preferable for a broadband and flexible THz detector. Figure 2a schematically provides
a general and simple explanation of the photothermoelectric effect.
When the THz wave is irradiated onto the CNT detector, the THz absorption
by the CNT film causes local heating. Along with the resulting temperature
gradient, the carriers diffuse in the CNT film, and the voltage, as
a THz-detected signal, is generated, which is described by the following
equation 1  Here, V is the photoinduced
voltage, S is the Seebeck coefficient of the material,
and ΔT is the temperature gradient of the material.
On the basis of the detection mechanism of the photothermoelectric
effect, THz illumination caused a voltage change (Figure 2b), and the THz-induced voltage
reached a maximum at the two interfaces (Figure 2c). Note that the polarity of the THz signal
was opposite between the source- and drain-electrode sides, which
is characteristic of the photothermoelectric effect. Although not
shown here, we experimentally confirmed that the CNT device responded
to broadband THz waves from the subTHz to 39 THz frequency region.22

CNT solution was deposited on a cellulose membrane filter and was
vacuumed until the CNT solution was fully filtered (typically during
several hours). The film was then dried and finally the CNT film was
picked up using tweezers. (b) THz absorption spectrum taken by THz

the carriers diffused and the voltage (THz response) was generated.
(b) THz response map taken by scanning the THz laser spot over the
CNT device. According to the expression of the photothermoelectric
effect, as shown in (a), the highest THz responses were generated
at the interfaces between the CNT film and the source/drain electrodes,
and the polarities of the THz response signal were opposite between
the source and drain electrodes. (c) Current vs voltage with and without
THz irradiation at 1.4 THz.

To gain a deeper understanding of the photothermoelectric
effect,
we elaborated eq 1 according
to the actual model by considering the Seebeck coefficient of the
metal–CNT composite material Stotal (Figure 3a). When
the heat flows parallel through the metal and CNT, as shown in Figure 3a, the Seebeck coefficient
of the metal–CNT composite material, Stotal, is expressed as 2  where σmetal and
σCNT are the electrical conductivities and tmetal and tCNT are
the thicknesses
of the metal and CNT film, respectively. Equation 2 indicates that the value of Stotal is determined by the ratio of the CNT thickness
and the conductivity of the electrode metal and the CNT film when
the THz-induced heat flows parallel through the metal and the CNT
film. From Figure 3a, we obtained the following equation 3  where SCNT and Stotal are the Seebeck coefficients of the CNT
film and the metal–CNT composite material, respectively and TMax, TA, and TB are the temperatures at the interface of the
metal and CNT film, at the edge of the metal, and at the CNT film,
respectively. When Smetal < Stotal < SCNT,
an effective approach to achieve a high photoinduced voltage V (detection sensitivity) is to increase TA and to decrease TB. We previously
reported a sensitivity enhancement through this approach by optimizing
the thicknesses of the electrode metals and employing a high thermal
conductivity metal for higher TA and a
low thermal conductivity metal for lower TB.22

experiments. (a) Actual model by considering the Seebeck coefficient

(e) Experimental results and their comparison with the simulation
results of (d). Good agreement between the simulation and experimental
results were observed.

An alternative approach is to increase TMax. Here, we examined this approach (a TMax increase) through simulations based on the thermal
conduction model
of the CNT device and experimental verification. Figure 3d shows the simulated temperature
gradients for different channel widths and thicknesses of the CNT
film, which were calculated through a steady-state thermal analysis.
The simulation results reveal that a narrower channel and a thinner
film result in a larger temperature gradient and that a thinner film
leads to shorter time constant (THz response time). These behaviors
originate from the thermal localization via the high thermal resistance
of the CNT film, which is more effective for such a narrow and thin
CNT films. Note that the above thermal simulation was carried out
under the condition of high THz absorption rate of the CNT film. We
experimentally observed that the CNT film is required to be thicker
than several-tens nanometer so that the THz absorption rate exceeds
90%. We also note that the thickness of the CNT should be larger than
1 μm to retain its free-standing shape. Figures S2 and S3 of
the Supporting Information clearly indicate
that the TMax value and time constant
are strongly governed by the cross-sectional area of the CNT film,
supporting the above interpretation. Figure 3e displays the experimental results describing
the CNT size dependence of the THz response, showing features that
well agree with the simulation results. On the basis of the strong
relationship between the cross-sectional area of the CNT film and
the THz response, we enhanced the THz-induced temperature gradient
in the CNT film. We estimated the noise equivalent power (NEP) of
the improved CNT detector, which was calculated by the noise voltage Vnoise and the sensitivity Vsens as follows 4  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, R is the resistance, Δf is the frequency
bandwidth, and Peffect is an effective
power of the THz wave at the detector. The measured values are Vnoise = 2 nV Hz–1/2, Peffect = 58 μW, and S × ΔT = 6.65 mV under vacuum, respectively
(Figure 4). According
to the above values and eq 4, the NEP was estimated to be 17 pW Hz–1/2, which is of a similar or superior level compared to competing room-temperature
thermal detectors.23

Figure 4 (a) Noise voltage spectrum
of the CNT THz detector. The measured
noise voltage was reduced to 2 nV Hz–1/2, which
well agrees with the theoretical value of the thermal noise limit
of 2.75 nV Hz–1/2, given by, where kB is
the Boltzmann constant, Δf is the frequency
bandwidth, T is the temperature, and R is the resistance. (b) THz response of the optimized-thermal-design
CNT THz detector based on Figure 3, where the channel width is 300 μm, the film
thickness is 2 μm, and the effective irradiation power is 58
μW at 39 THz. The obtained THz response was 6.65 mV under vacuum.

We then studied a design for a
THz detector array to enhance the
performance of the THz camera. For high-resolution THz camera imaging,
miniaturization of a single-element detector is indispensable. In
this sense, a narrow CNT channel width, as shown in Figure 3, is also favorable for a high
camera resolution. On the other hand, regarding the effect of the
channel length, we previously observed an issue where, as the channel
length was reduced, the positive and negative THz signals between
the source and drain electrodes were canceled. To resolve this issue,
as shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, we previously fabricated the detector array with different electrode
materials (Ti and Au) and avoided the cancelation of the THz responses
generated at the interfaces of the source and drain electrodes. Although
we demonstrated multiview THz imaging with the flexible THz camera
based on this design, the spatial resolution of the acquired images
(1 mm) were much lower than the estimated detection area (0.5 mm).
Additionally, as shown in Figure 5a, we found that the spatial resolution was different
between the source- and drain-electrode sides, where the detection
area at the interface with the Au electrode (0.4 mm) was 2.5 times
narrower than that with the Ti electrode (0.95 mm). This led to a
low spatial resolution of the THz camera.

Figure 5 Effect of the irradiated
wave penetration through the electrode
metals. (a) Spatial resolution comparison between the Au and Ti electrode
sides. A sharp tail appeared on the Au electrode side (HWHM = 0.4
mm), which is 2.5 times narrower than that on the Ti electrode side
(HWHM = 0.95 mm). (b) Schematic illustration of the actual detection
area. The detection area was expanded because of the irradiated wave
penetration into the CNT film through the electrode metals, consequently
resulting in an ideal detection area and undesired detection area.
(c) HWHMs of the THz laser spot scanning for the detectors with electrode
thicknesses of 5, 40 and 100 nm. A thicker electrode and higher frequency
of the illumination wave led to a sharper peak. (d) Undesired detection
area and electric field intensity of the THz wave vs the electrode
thickness. The symbols are the experimental results plotted from Table 1, and the dashed lines
denote the electric field intensity of the THz wave penetrated into
the CNT film through the electrode material, which was calculated
by eq 5.

To elucidate these phenomena, we fabricated detectors
with Au electrodes
with different thicknesses ranging from 5 to 200 nm and compared the
sensing areas of these detectors. Figure 5 and Table 1 represent the results
of the line profiles of the THz signals and half widths at half-maximum
(HWHMs) for different electrode thicknesses upon scanning the spots
of THz waves with 1.4 and 29 THz frequencies across the channel-length
direction of the CNT detectors. The HWHM corresponds to the spatial
resolution of the arrayed detectors. The results reveal that the use
of a thicker electrode produced a sharper profile and that the HWHM
narrowed with an increasing frequency of the illuminated wave.

Generally, the spatial resolution of a detector is chiefly determined
by the area receiving the incident waves, in this case, the channel
size of the CNT film. This, however, is not true of the present situation,
as the area size of the CNT channel used here is the same for all
the measured devices. Because the HWHM depended on the Au film thickness
and the frequency of the irradiated wave, the incident wave could
have penetrated into the CNT film through the electrode material,
thereby enlarging the sensing area. According to Maxwell’s
equations, when an electromagnetic wave travels inside a material
with attenuation, the electric field intensity E in
the material and the penetration depth d are described
as 5   6  where ω is the angular frequency of
the electromagnetic wave, σ is the conductivity of the material,
and μ is the permeability of the material. Considering the penetration
effect, the actual detection area can be expressed by summing the
ideal detection area (the channel area) and the undesired detection
area (the wave penetration area), as shown in Figure 5b. Figure 5d plots the undesired detection area and the electric
field intensity of the THz wave as a function of the Au thickness
for 1.4 and 29 THz frequency wave irradiation. Here, the symbols denote
the experimental results of the undesired detection area, and the
dashed lines correspond to the electric field intensity of the irradiated
wave penetrated into the CNT film through the electrode materials,
as calculated using eq 5. The general trend of the experimental results well fits the calculated
curves, indicating that the THz wave penetrates into the electrode
metals. Therefore, the additional THz photothermoelectric voltage
occurs in the vertical CNT–electrode interface, which unintentionally
expands the actual detection area.

To the best of our knowledge,
this phenomenon has not been noted
or discussed in the photothermoelectric effect and device research,
which we believe is partly because the majority of research on the
photothermoelectric effect has been long focused on the near-infrared
and visible light regions (over 100 THz).24−27 In these regions, the penetration
depth is estimated to be at most a few nanometers and can therefore
be ignored in most cases (Table 2). We can thus conclude that carefully choosing a metal
and electrode thicknesses is of much importance, especially in the
THz region, to prevent wave penetration through the electrodes. The
obtained resolution of our THz detector was about 290 μm for
the 1.4 THz irradiation as shown in Table 1, whose value was comparable to the wavelength
of the 1.4 THz wave, 214 μm. This means that our THz detector
almost reached the diffraction-limited resolution. We note that the
current channel length was optimized for the 1.4 THz irradiation and
therefore expect that when a shorter channel is used, spatial resolution
for the 29 THz irradiation should also reach the order of the wavelength.

By incorporating all the findings
and techniques clarified in this
work, we fabricated a higher-sensitivity and higher-resolution CNT
THz camera than our earlier type of camera. Figure 6a displays the photographic and schematic
images of the fabricated THz camera. A CNT film with a 30 μm
thickness and 500 μm channel width was used, and 10 nm thick
Ti and 200 nm thick Au were deposited as source and drain electrodes,
respectively. A TiO2 film was then formed through surface
oxidation of the Ti film as the thermal isolation layer to avoid thermal
diffusion to the adjacent metal layer. Finally, a THz-reflection layer
with a 100 nm thick Au film was evaporated to suppress the THz wave
penetration into the CNT film. (Note that the calculated penetration
depth for a 1 THz wave into the Au film is 75 nm.) In order to acquire
clear two-dimensional THz images, the resolution along the channel-width
direction has to be improved together with the resolution along the
channel-length direction, as discussed above. To remove unnecessary
signals generated through the interference between the neighboring
detectors, we also thermally isolated the detector elements by cutting
the CNT film in between the two detection areas (Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). As shown in the full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) results in Figure S6, the detection area along the channel-width direction was
reduced by almost 85%.

Figure 6 (a) Photographic image of the fabricated THz camera and
device
structure of the single element. The source electrode was composed
of the thermal conduction layer (Ti), thermal isolation layer (TiO2), and THz-reflection layer (Au). (b) THz images of the metal
clip acquired by the previous THz scanner and the refined THz camera
using the high-resolution technique in (a). As shown in the line scan
data (lower figures), the undesired detection area was reduced by
a factor of 70.

Figure 6b compares
the imaging performances of our previous THz camera and the present
high-resolution THz camera. The upper panels are the THz images of
a metal clip with a diameter of 1.28 mm, and the lower plots are line
scan data taken from a part of the upper images. As shown in Figure 6b, a clearer image
was obtained by suppressing the THz wave penetration through the electrode
materials and consequently eliminating undesired signals. By subtracting
the sum of the channel area and the diameter of the object (1.28 mm)
from the FWHM value, we estimated that the undesired detection areas
of the two cameras were 1.5 mm for the previous type and 20 μm
for the present type, indicating improved camera resolution. The calculated
values of the penetration depth in Table 2 suggest that the use of Ni as an electrode
material would more strongly suppress wave penetration and the resulting
undesired detection area.

These THz images were taken with the
acquisition time of 3 h simply
because of a limited number of signal readout being used. We expect
that it should be improved up to 13 ms that corresponds to the fundamental
response time of our THz detector (Figure 3c) by integrating a large detector array
with a multichannel readout and processing system.

Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the underlying mechanism of a photothermoelectric
THz CNT camera and improved the thermal device design by optimizing
the physical factors influencing the sensitivity, response time, and
spatial resolution. The simulated and experimental results reveal
that a smaller cross-sectional area of the CNT channel results in
higher sensitivity and a faster response speed because of thermal
localization via a high thermal resistance. In addition, we found
that the actual detection area was strongly governed by the incident
wave penetration into the CNT film through the metallic electrode
materials, leading to a degradation of the spatial resolution of the
multiple-array THz camera. The implementation of a blocking layer
for the THz penetration and a thermal isolation layer allowed us to
sufficiently suppress this effect and to miniaturize the actual detection
area. By utilizing all the technologies based on these findings, we
enhanced the imaging performance of the CNT THz camera and obtained
a much clearer THz image compared to the previous type of CNT THz
camera. In addition to the THz camera, the presented thermal scheme
will also be applicable to other thermal-type photodetectors,28,29 optically activated portable batteries,30 and so forth and suggests a huge potential for further optimization
by engineering the thermal structures.

Materials and Methods
Device
Fabrication Process
We employed a flexible and
inch-size CNT film as the material for the bendable THz camera. The
original CNT film was produced through a filtering process of a CNT
solution with a membrane (Figure 1a).31 The film structure,
such as scale, thickness, and density, were controlled by adjusting
the concentration of the CNT solution. The typical structure parameters
of the CNT film were as follows: scale (A3, 30 × 42 cm), thickness
(2–150 μm), density (0.4 g/cm3), basis weight
(0.2 g/m2), porosity (63%), and specific surface area (740
m2/g). The Seebeck coefficient of the CNT film was measured
to be 55 μV/K. We cut a CNT film into the appropriate size for
a single-element THz detector. The Ti and Au source and drain electrodes,
separately, were evaporated through a hard mask without a photoresist
to prevent chemical contamination. Each THz detector was placed onto
a chip carrier and a universal board, and readout wires were connected
by silver paste.

Measurement System
The results of
the THz response
of the CNT THz detector were obtained using three THz sources that
cover a wide range of frequencies: a quantum cascade laser (λ
= 7.7 μm), a CO2 gas laser (λ = 10.2 μm),
a THz laser pumped by a CO2 laser (λ = 214.6 μm).
The THz radiation from these sources were guided and concentrated
to the detection area by lenses or fibers. The THz responses (generated
THz-induced voltages) were directly recorded with a digital multimeter.
For the low-response signals, a current amplifier was used. For the
THz response mapping (Figures 2b, 5a,c, and S6) and the THz imaging measurement (Figure 6b), we used two-axis translation stages and
their corresponding controllers. We used a germanium substrate as
the opaque object because of the high transmission through this object
at a frequency of 29 THz. We employed a lock-in amplifier to measure
the noise density spectrum of the THz detector (Figure S2) with a bandwidth of 1 Hz (or 0.3 Hz) and a smoothing
time constant of 1 s (or 10 s). The NEP was estimated using the equation
NEP [W Hz–1/2] = noise voltage density [V Hz–1/2]/sensitivity [V/W]. The sensitivity [V/W] was derived
by dividing the voltage response [V] by the irradiation power at the
detection area [W]. The THz absorption spectra of the CNT film (Figure 1b) were taken with
a THz-time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) transmission measurement
at room temperature with a data averaging of 1028 times, a frequency
bandwidth of 0.5–7 THz, a time resolution of 2 fs, a frequency
resolution of 3.8 GHz, a scan range of 262 ps, a throughput of 16
ms/scan, and a frequency accuracy of 10 GHz (at 1.41 THz). The THz-TDS
system was placed inside a glovebox, which was filled by dry air to
avoid THz absorption by water vapor.

Thermal Conduction Analysis
of the CNT Device
To simulate
the device shape dependence of the thermal conduction (Figures 3, S2, and S3), we performed a steady-state thermal analysis and a
transient thermal analysis using the ANSYS software package. The series
of simulation results were calculated under the conditions of the
thermal conductivity of the CNT film: 10 W/m K for the X–Y plane and 0.1 W/m K for the Z axis;32 the thermal conductivity of the electrode metal (Au): 315 W/m K;
the heat transfer coefficient of air: 10 W/m2 K, and under
calm conditions at 300 K. The simulation model that we employed is
depicted in Figures S2a and S3a. Assuming
that the power of incident THz wave was totally absorbed by the CNT
film, as experimentally shown in Figure 1b, and was converted into the heat, we added
the heat on the surface of the CNT film. We considered the situation
in which the CNT film retained its free-standing shape without the
substrate and was exposed to the atmosphere. The outside (air) temperature
was set to be 22 °C. The temperature distribution was calculated
by solving the following heat equation given by 7  where ρ
is the density, C is the specific heat capacity, k is the thermal
conductivity, and Q is the total amount of heat.
