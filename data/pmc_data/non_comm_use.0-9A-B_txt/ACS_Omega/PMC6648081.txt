Triazoles are an important class
of N-heterocycles that are well
known for their broad biological activities. In this work, we would
like to demonstrate a direct synthesis of the rare fused bicyclic
[1,2,3]-triazoles, employing γ-N-protected
amino diazoketones as useful synthetic platforms. The strategy was
based on the deprotection of a trifluoroacetamide group for the intramolecular
and in situ generation of an α-diazo imine intermediate, followed
by a 5-endo-dig cyclization to construct the bicyclic
unit. In this fashion, the synthesis of a series of fused bicyclic
[1,2,3]-triazoles could be carried out in good to excellent yields
(63–95%).

Introduction
For
many years, the synthesis of N-heterocyclic compounds has been
on the spotlight of different fields of science, especially on the
organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. The interest in the synthesis
of these compounds is associated with the diversified biological activities
found among the class of N-heterocycles.1 Triazoles, for example, have been widely explored due to their interesting
biological activities,2,3 such as anticancer, anti-human
immunodeficiency virus, antilieshmanial, antitrypanosomal, and antibiotic
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 Biologically
active triazole compounds.

Since the pioneering work of Huisgen for the 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition
reaction between azides and alkynes4 in
the 1960s, the synthesis of five-membered heterocycles (including
triazolic cores) has been on the spotlight of N-heterocyclic chemistry.
After this work, Sharpless and co-workers improved Huisgen’s
approach for the construction of triazole cores via an elegant methodology
based on the copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloadditions.5,6 Since these contributions, the synthesis and biological evaluation
of triazoles have been exponentially growing.7 Known as “click reaction”, this well-established methodology
allows the synthesis of N1-, C4-, and/or C5-substituted triazolic
cores in an intramolecular or intermolecular fashion.8 Due to its versatility, the click reaction has been employed
as one of the principal strategies for the construction of [1,2,3]-triazolic
cores.

Despite the cycloaddition reaction between azides and
alkynes described
above, there are just few methodologies found in the literature for
the synthesis of triazole compounds, particularly fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles.9 An interesting approach for the bicyclic triazolic
core construction was reported by Katritzky and co-workers.10 In this work, an intramolecular reaction between
an in situ generated diazonium salt and an azo group was performed,
furnishing 1-aminobenzotriazole (Scheme 1, chart A). Another approach was reported
by Kascheres and co-workers11 based on
the employment of diazo-transfer reagents (such as 3-diazo-5,7-dinitroindolin-2-one)
for the synthesis of fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles from cyclic
amines (Scheme 1, chart
B). An alternative strategy was also applied in the synthesis of bicyclic
[1,2,3]-triazoles employing the already constructed triazolic cores
in sequential reactions that led to the formation of the second ring.
Usually, the triazole unit is synthesized by the azide–alkyne
cycloaddition reaction and the second ring formed from C–C
coupling reactions.12−16 For example, in Fiandanese’s strategy,17 an intramolecular Heck reaction was the key step to construct
the bicyclic unit (Scheme 1, chart C).

Scheme 1 Selected Methodologies for the Synthesis of Bicyclic
[1,2,3]-Triazoles
Diazocompounds are versatile building blocks known for
their application
in the synthesis of different classes of heterocycles.18−20 Due to its versatility, we wondered if γ-N-protected diazoketones could be employed as advanced building blocks
to construct these bicyclic triazole cores (Scheme 1, chart D). Although a similar transformation
was initially observed by Clark,21 during
the preparation of two substrates that would be applied in an ammonium
ylide rearrangement, to the best of our knowledge, general methods
that permit the synthesis of several bicyclic triazoles have not been
explored. Herein, we describe the synthesis of bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles,
containing two fused five-membered rings, from γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) amino diazoketones. This was accomplished in a
straightforward fashion that includes three sequential steps in a
single reaction vessel: N-deprotection, intramolecular
α-diazo imine formation, and 5-endo-dig cyclization
(Scheme 1, chart D).

Results
and Discussion
Aiming at the synthesis of γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl)
amino diazoketones, we started our work with the preparation of γ-nitro
ester precursors 2a–j (Scheme 2). Initially, we synthesized
γ-nitro ester 2a via a conjugate addition between
the commercially available ethyl cinnamate and nitromethane to furnish 2a in 84% yield. Since not all of the ethyl cinnamates are
commercially available, we employed a Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
olefination for the generation of α,β-unsaturated esters,
which were directly submitted to a conjugate addition with nitromethane.
By this way, γ-nitro ester precursors were obtained in 50–70%
yield after a two-step process, without the isolation of the respective
α,β-unsaturated ester.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of γ-Nitro Esters
The next step consisted of
the synthesis of γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) amino
acids based on a protocol of nitro group
reduction to amine, hydrolysis of the ester portion, and protection
of the generated free amine (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of γ-N-(Trifluoroacetyl)
Amino Acids
The change in the
reducing power of sodium borohydrate by the combination
with inorganic salts is a well-known method.22−25 For the reduction of the nitro
group, we selected the classical method, which employs nickel chloride
hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O) and sodium borohydrate
(NaBH4) for the in situ generation of nickel borohydrate
complex.26 After the reduction, ester hydrolysis
was carried out in refluxing aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid
(HCl) to furnish γ-amino acids as hydrochloride salts.27 Next, the final step consisted of the protection
of the amino group as a trifluoroacetamide via a well-known protocol
employing trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) and triethylamine (Et3N) in methanol.28 By the application
of these protocols, we were able to perform these three steps without
any purification of the intermediates. In this fashion, a series of
γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) amino acids 3a–j could be synthesized in 40–83% yield
after a three-step process (Scheme 3).

Once the synthesis of γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl)
amino acids 3a–j was secured, we
turned our attention to the preparation of γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) diazoketones. In this direction, we applied a
well-established protocol for carboxylic acid activation and diazomethane
acylation. Refluxing the corresponding γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl)
amino acids with oxalyl chloride for 2.5 h activated the carboxylic
acid function as an acyl chloride intermediate. In the following step,
the freshly prepared acyl chloride was allowed to react with an ethereal
solution of diazomethane.29 Applying this
sequence, γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) diazoketones 4a–k were prepared in 30–94% yield
(Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis
of γ-N-(Trifluoroacetyl) Diazoketones
We also tried to obtain more
substituted γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) diazoketones,
aiming at the synthesis of more
complex fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles. For this purpose, we followed
the same protocol depicted in Scheme 4 for the activation of γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl)
amino acid 3a, although changing the diazomethane for
an ethereal solution of diazoethane in the acylation step. Unfortunately,
the reaction with diazoethane has shown only 20% yield for the formation
of the substituted γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) diazoketone 4k. When we tried the same approach in other γ-N-(trifluroacetyl) amino acids, we only achieved traces
of the substituted γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) diazoketones.

The last step consisted of the construction of the fused bicyclic
[1,2,3]-triazole cores from the synthesized γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) diazoketones. It is worth mentioning that the
synthesis of this class of fused bicyclic triazoles is less explored
than other classes of triazoles. Usually, the main protocols for the
synthesis of these compounds depend on the azide–alkyne cycloaddition
approach via metal catalysis and normally use harsh experimental conditions
(high temperatures and/or long reaction time).30−32 On the other
hand, our strategy is based on a mild and direct process for the deprotection
of the trifluoroacetamide group with subsequent cyclization to construct
rings of the fused bicyclic triazoles.

Hence, deprotection was
carried out in a simple protocol by gently
refluxing the corresponding diazoketone with an aqueous solution of
potassium carbonate (K2CO3). In this fashion,
several fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles 5a–k were synthesized in a straightforward process in good to
excellent yields (63–95%) (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of the Fused Bicyclic [1,2,3]-Triazoles
Considering the mechanism involved
during the construction of the
fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles, we believe that after the generation
of free amine by the trifluoroacetamide hydrolysis, the formation
of an α-diazo imine intermediate occurs (Scheme 6). Once this intermediate is formed, the
next step consists of a 5-endo-dig cyclization by
the nucleophilic attack of the imine to the terminal nitrogen of the
diazo portion, leading to the bicyclic triazolic core.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have described a straightforward method for the
synthesis of fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazoles from γ-N-(trifluroacetyl) diazoketones. Different from protocols
based on the Huisgen cycloaddition reaction, the employed strategy
was based on the deprotection of a trifluoroacetamide group followed
by the in situ generation of an α-diazo imine intermediate.
From this key intermediate, we could prepare a series of fused bicyclic
[1,2,3]-triazoles in 63–95% yields, via a 5-endo-dig cyclization step.

Experimental Section
General Information
All of the reagents were purchased
at highest quality and used without further purification. The solvents
were previously dried based on protocols previously described in the
literature. The reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(charge coupled device) on 0.25 mm silica gel plates using UV light
as visualization agent and KMnO4 in aqueous KOH solution
for staining. The purifications were performed by chromatographic
columns using Silica Gel 60 (particle size, 0.063–0.210 mm)
unless otherwise stated. The reported yields refer to the products
isolated after flash column chromatography. The proton nuclear magnetic
resonance (1H NMR) acquisitions were performed in a 400
or 500 MHz equipment. The chemical shifts (δ) were referenced
from the tetramethylsilane (0.00 ppm), and the coupling constants
(J) are reported in hertz. The following multiplicities
abbreviations were used in this report: bs, broad signal; s, singlet;
d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; quint, quintet; sext, sextet;
sept, septet; dd, doublet of doublets; dt, doublet of triplets; dtd,
doublet of triplet of doublets; ddd, doublet of doublet of doublets;
dddd, doublet of doublet of doublet of doublets; td, triplet of doubles;
dddt; doublet of doublet of doublet of triplets; tt, triplet of triples;
tq, triplet of quartets; qd, quartet of doublets; septd, septet of
doublets; and m, multiplet. The carbon nuclear magnetic resonance
(13C NMR) acquisitions were performed in a 101 or 126 MHz
equipment. The chemical shifts (δ) were referenced from CDCl3 (77.0 ppm) or CD3OD (49.0 ppm). The infrared spectra
acquisitions were performed using an Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer
of 4.0 cm–1 resolution and were reported in number
of waves. The melting points were determined using a digital melting
point apparatus. The high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded
using the electrospray ionization (ESI) (hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap
FT-MS and QqTOF/MS-Microtof-QII models).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of γ-N-(Trifluoroacetyl) Amino Acids 3a–j26−28
In a 100 mL round-bottom flask, 1.90 g of γ-nitro
ester 2a (8.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 40.0 mL of anhydrous
methanol were added under argon atmosphere. To the solution, 1.90
g of NiCl2.6H2O (8.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added,
and the suspension was stirred at −10 °C for 5 min. To
the cooled suspension, 3.63 g of NaBH4 (96.0 mmol, 12.0
equiv) was added in portions (CAUTION: violent gas extrusion), and
the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at room temperature. After
this period, the reaction was quenched with a saturated solution of
NH4Cl and extracted with CHCl3. The organic
layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated.
To a 100 mL round-bottom flask with the crude reaction mixture of
the first step was added 40 mL of a 6.0 N aqueous solution of HCl,
and the reaction was allowed to reflux for 20 h. After this period,
the reaction was cooled and extracted with diethyl ether. The aqueous
phase was concentrated furnishing the amine hydrochloride salt as
a pale yellow solid. To a 50 mL round-bottom flask were added amine
hydrochloride salt secured in the second step and 13.0 mL of anhydrous
methanol under argon atmosphere. The solution was cooled to 0 °C,
and 5.57 mL of Et3N (40.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv) was added. The
reaction was stirred at the same temperature for 10 min, then 3.38
mL of TFAA (24.0 mmol, 3.0 equiv) was added dropwise (CAUTION: gas
extrusion), and the reaction was stirred at room temperature overnight.
After this period, the reaction was concentrated and the crude reaction
mixture was purified by flash column chromatography (Silica Gel, hexanes/AcOEt
1:1) to afford γ-N-(trifluoroacetyl) amino
acid 3a in 73% yield (1.61 g, 5.85 mmol) as a white solid.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Bicyclic
[1,2,3]-Triazole
Cores 5a–k
To a 5 mL round-bottom
flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar were added 25.0 mg of N-(trifluoroacetyl) amino diazoketone 4a (0.084
mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 1.7 mL of methanol. Then, 0.35 mL of K2CO3 5% aqueous solution (0.13 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added
and the reaction mixture was stirred over reflux for 75 min. After
this period, the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature
and concentrated. The reaction mixture was purified by flash chromatography
with a short pad of silica (CHCl3 as eluent) to furnish
the fused bicyclic [1,2,3]-triazole 5a in 91% yield (14.0
mg, 0.076 mmol) as a pale yellow solid.
