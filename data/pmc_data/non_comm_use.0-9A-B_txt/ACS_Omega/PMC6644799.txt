The access to free,
unsolvated ions at high concentrations and ambient temperatures enabled
by ionic liquids results in previously unobserved reactivity for even
well-studied ions, demonstrated here by acetate ([OAc]−) acting as a reducing agent for B10H14 but
only when used as a neat liquid in [C2mim][OAc] at ambient
temperature. More typical reaction products are obtained when B10H14 is reacted with [C2mim][OAc] at
an elevated temperature or in the presence of strong bases.

1 Introduction
Ionic
liquids (ILs) are salts with low melting points (usually defined as
melting below 100 °C),1 which distinguishes
them from ionic compounds in that they can be used as solvents or
in solventless reactions. As dissolution of a salt in a molecular
solvent necessarily reduces the activity of the ions because of their
interactions with the solvent, new avenues of reactivity can be discovered
for ions by incorporating them into ILs and using them in the neat
liquid state. A good example is the IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate ([C2mim][OAc]), which is liquid at room temperature,2 where the anion naturally acts as a Brønsted
or Lewis base (for instance, in the dissolution of normally insoluble
biopolymers)3 and the cation can also act
as a Lewis base and react with electrophilic molecules because of
a dynamic equilibrium between the [C2mim]+ cation
and the corresponding imidazole-2-ylidene.4,5

Here, we sought to expand the known main group chemistry of [C2mim][OAc] to boron by investigating its reactivity with nido-decaborane, B10H14. Boranes have
been of fundamental interest to chemists for decades because of their
complex geometries and their ability to bond to a wide range of main
group and transition metal elements.6 Functionalization
of boranes is also being investigated to make advanced materials for
applications such as hydrogen storage.7 Decaboranes in particular have been found to show unusual reactivity
toward ILs; for instance, the cage opening reaction of closo-B10H128,9 and substitution of
the halogen atom (X) on nido-B10H13X proceed in dialkylimidazolium ILs under unusually mild
conditions.10 We previously found that
B10H14 reacted spontaneously with ions from
energetic azolium ILs to form stable IL-soluble species,11 such as [B9H14]− formed through deprotonation and rearrangement of B10H14.12 B10H14 is therefore an interesting main group probe for reactivity
with [C2mim][OAc] because it possesses Lewis acidic sites
of variable nature which may prefer the [OAc]− ion
or the carbene.

2 Results and Discussion
We first tried solventless reactions of [C2mim][OAc]
and B10H14 by combining them at variable molar
ratios and temperatures. The reactants were weighed out under ambient
conditions and were either allowed to stand at room temperature in
sealed containers or heated in unsealed containers at 60 °C.
Reaction conditions are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

Reactions at elevated temperatures proceeded
rapidly with a color change from pale yellow to red-orange and visible
gas evolution. The reaction of B10H14 with 1
equiv of [C2mim][OAc] gave a strongly colored mixture of
red-orange solids, while reactions with two or more equiv of [C2mim][OAc] gave yellow semi-solid products which were similar
in appearance to each other.

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
confirmed that crystalline phases were a minor component of the product.
Nevertheless, two of the products formed in this set of reactions
were identified by isolating crystals suitable for single crystal
XRD (SCXRD) directly from crude reaction mixtures: [C2mim]2[B12H12] isolated from the 1:1 reaction
(Table S1, entry 1) and [C2mim][B(O(BOO)2)2] isolated from the 1:5 reaction (Table S1, entry 5), both of which are known.13,14 The crystal structure of [C2mim]2[B12H12] (Figure S6) was found
to be a new polymorph, which is isomorphous with the perfluorinated
analog [C2mim]2[B12F12].15 The [B12H12]2– could form from disproportionation of B10H14, as reported for other borohydrides,16 while [B(O(BOO)2)2]− can be made from boric acid which could have formed
through hydrolysis.

Interestingly, [C2mim][OAc] and
B10H14 reacted spontaneously at room temperature
as well, although more slowly. In this case, B10H14 fully dissolved in 1 equiv of [C2mim][OAc] at room temperature
to give a red-orange liquid. Reactions with two and 3 equiv of [C2mim][OAc] gave yellow pastes, which were found to be composed
of many single crystalline plates dispersed through a viscous matrix.
B10H14 was also observed to dissolve in 10 equiv
of [C2mim][OAc] with stirring to give a give a viscous
yet free-flowing liquid. All reactions proceeded over the course of
several hours with a visible color change of the IL from pale yellow
to red-orange and the slow formation of bubbles and appeared to reach
completion overnight, except for the reaction with 10 equiv of [C2mim][OAc], which gradually faded back to yellow over a period
of several weeks. PXRD of the reaction of B10H14 with 3 equiv of [C2mim][OAc] showed a larger amount of
crystalline material than observed in the high temperature reaction.
Furthermore, while some of the XRD peaks (including those at 16.5–17.9°
and 25° 2θ) could be assigned to [C2mim][B(O(BOO)2)2], others (most notably the large peak at 6°
2θ) indicated the presence of at least one unidentified product
which had not crystallized at high temperature (Figure 1).

and blue rectangles drawn around peaks corresponding to those phases,
respectively.

A single crystal from
the 1:3 reaction mixture was isolated, analyzed by SCXRD, and found
to be [C2mim]2[B10H13(OAc)],
in which the B10H14 molecule has converted into
a doubly anionic borane ester (Figure 2). The structure is notable for two reasons. First,
we were unable to find any prior report of functionalization of B10H14 with a carboxylate through a direct reaction
with a carboxylate salt. The typical routes we found were cage-opening
reactions with closo-decaborane17 or substitution reactions on derivatized boranes.18,19 Second, the product is not formed through a typical substitution
reaction, as a cation (H+) is being substituted by an anion
([OAc]−) to give a doubly anionic product.

view of the anion. Dashed lines indicate the shortest cation–anion
contacts.

The open face of the [B10H13(OAc)]2– anion has two endocyclic,
bridging hydrogen atoms and four exocyclic ligands (three hydrogen
atoms and the [OAc]− group), which matches the structure
of the [B10H14]2– anion, not
B10H14.20 The C–O
bond distances of the acetate group are very dissymmetric [1.214(4)
Å vs 1.314(4) Å] and match well with those of other borane
esters.21 The two [C2mim]+ counterions form intermolecular contacts distributed all
over the cluster (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and are not concentrated
around the former [OAc]− ion. All of these indicate
reduction rather than substitution; the negative charge of [OAc]− has been completely transferred to the borane cage.

The Cambridge Structural Database22 contains
only two structurally characterized examples of dianions produced
through similar reactions: [B10H14]2–, prepared by reacting B10H14 with NaBH4,20 and [B10H13CN]2–, prepared by reacting B10H14 with NaCN.23 These reactions
are postulated to proceed through deprotonation of B10H14 to give [B10H13]−, rearrangement of the hydrogen atoms, and addition of the anionic
ligand to the cluster. The anions from these reactions, H– (from NaBH4) and CN–, tend to undergo
very covalent bonding. Carboxylates, however, tend to bond with cations
such as H+ to give carboxylic acids or metal ions to give
metal complexes. The direct formation of an ester from a carboxylate
is very unusual, but here, it can be rationalized by the fact that
the negative charge becomes highly delocalized over the entire cluster.

We were unable to isolate [C2mim]2[B10H13(OAc)] for spectroscopic analysis or to determine
its yield. Isolation of this compound has proven to be very challenging
because it likely reacts with polar solvents, in which it would be
soluble, and the IL cannot be removed by evaporation. We attempted
workups on some reaction mixtures by washing with toluene, acetonitrile,
or a 50:50 v/v mixture of the two. On the basis of the color changes
observed, the products appeared to have no appreciable solubility
in toluene and reacted with both acetonitrile-containing solvents.

The 1:10 B10H14/[C2mim][OAc] reaction
mixture prepared at room temperature was analyzed by 1H, 13C, and 11B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to
obtain spectroscopic information on boron-containing species present.
At least 13 resolvable maxima can be observed in the 11B spectrum within the range of 5 to −55 ppm (Figure 3), more than can possibly be
explained by any single boron-containing species likely to be present.
Unambiguous peak assignment is not possible because of the inability
to accurately integrate the overlapping peaks and lack of reference
data for 11B NMR in [C2mim][OAc]. The major
peak at −44 ppm is in an area consistent with an open skeleton
species containing bridging hydrogen atoms and may correspond to the
combined signals of B1, B3, B6, and B9 of [B10H13(OAc)]2–, which are the four positions most likely
to be shifted upfield by the shielding effect of bridging hydrogen
atoms.24 Two signals at roughly half the
height of the major peak are located at −8 and −25 ppm,
which may be associated with two pairs of symmetry related atoms,
B5/B7 and B8/B10, respectively. B2 and B4 are likely coalesced in
the band of signals from 0 to −12, based on the reported chemical
shifts for the analogous positions in [B10H14]2–. The remaining peaks may be due to unreacted
decaborane or other boron hydrides including [B12H12]2– and cannot be assigned definitively.

Figure 3 11B NMR spectrum of the neat 1:10 B10H14/[C2mim][OAc] reaction mixture and tentative assignments of the
main peaks (numbering based on Figure 2).

Although 11B NMR is ultimately ambiguous as to the identity of the boron-containing
species present, 13C NMR shows definitive evidence for
the presence of [B10H13(OAc)]2–. A set of new peaks emerge near the 13C NMR signals for
the carbonyl and methyl carbon atoms of [OAc]−/HOAc
but not for any other carbon atom, which indicates the formation of
an ester (Figure S2, Supporting Information). A second set of even smaller peaks corresponding to the [OAc]− carbon atoms in the 13C spectra also appears;
the symmetrical B6,B9-disubstituted [B10H12(OAc)2]2– seems to be the most likely assignment
because both [OAc]− groups would be chemically equivalent.
Because there are no other reactions with the IL besides these additions
to the borane cluster, the formation of borates is most likely due
to the reaction with adventitious water and suggests a possible scavenging
mechanism.

We also made an attempt to force B10H14 to react with the [C2mim]+ moiety,
rather than [OAc]−. Excess [C2mim][OAc]
was first treated with either NaH or potassium tert-butoxide to generate the imidazole-2-ylidene quantitatively, and
B10H14 was then added (Table S2, Supporting Information). The IL changed in color
from red-orange to yellow over the course of several hours, after
which no variation of the color was observed over a period of several
weeks. To separate the products from inorganic salts, the reaction
mixtures were dissolved in an acetonitrile solution, layered with
benzene, and allowed to crystallize by slow evaporation at ambient
temperature. Any carboranes formed were expected to be stable to this
treatment, as well as B10H14 itself, which reacts
with acetonitrile only at an elevated temperature.25

Colorless crystalline blocks were isolated after
1 day, analyzed by SCXRD, and determined to be [C2mim]2[B10H10] (Figure 4, left). PXRD of solids obtained from the
reaction of B10H14 with KOtBu indicates that [C2mim]2[B10H10] is the major crystalline product after the reaction
(Figure 4, right).
[B10H10]2– can be made from
reactions of B10H12L2 molecules (a
class which B10H14 can be considered a member)
with bases.26 This suggests that B10H14 simply protonates the ylidene. It also further
supports that the unusual reactivity of [OAc]− comes
from accessing it at a high concentration and ambient temperature
as an IL because NaH and K(t-BuO) only undergo typical
chemistry when dissolved in [C2mim][OAc].

mixture (red) with the simulated pattern of [C2mim]2[B10H10].

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown
that B10H14 can react with [C2mim][OAc]
through multiple pathways to give boron clusters ([B12H12]2– and [B10H10]2–), boron oxyanions ([B(O(BOO)2)2]−), and the newly reported, reduced borane ester
([B10H13(OAc)]2–). The type
of chemistry which led to the formation of [B10H13(OAc)]2– has been previously observed in aqueous
systems with covalently bonding anions such as H– and CN–, but we have now shown that the normally
stable [OAc]− anion can also undergo this reaction
when used as a neat IL. Using the IL as a solvent for other bases,
however, does not give access to unusual chemistry for those bases.
These observations are consistent with our previous findings that
the ability to access high concentrations of free ions at ambient
temperatures can be essential to their unusual reactivity, as it allows
them to proceed through reactions that are normally disrupted by side
reactions.27 Given the various contexts
in which borane chemistry is being explored, we hope that this finding
will lead to facile, IL-based approaches for a wide range of functionalized
borane derivatives.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
nido-Decaborane
(B10H14, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA), sodium
hydride (NaH, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), acetonitrile (Fisher Chemicals, Fair Lawn, NJ), and benzene
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate ([C2mim][OAc], IOLITEC USA, Tuscaloosa, AL) was
used as received for reactions with B10H14 and
was kept under oil pump vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h and degassed
before reactions with B10H14/NaH or B10H14/KOtBu.

PXRD data
were collected on a Bruker D2 PHASER equipped with a LynxEye linear
position sensitive detector (Bruker AXS, Madison, WI). Neat samples
were smeared directly onto the silicon wafer of a proprietary low-background
sample holder. Data were collected using a continuous coupled θ/2θ
scan with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation.

SCXRD data of [C2mim]2[B12H12], [C2mim][B(O(BOO)2)2], and [C2mim]2[B10H13(OAc)] were collected on a Bruker
diffractometer equipped with a PLATFORM 3-circle goniometer and an
APEX II CCD area detector (Bruker AXS) using graphite-monochromated
Mo-Kα radiation. Crystals were cooled to 100 K under a cold
stream of nitrogen using an Oxford N-HeliX cryostat (Oxford Cryosystems,
Oxford, UK). Hemispheres of data out to a resolution of at least 0.80
Å were collected by a strategy of φ and ω scans.
Unit cell determination, data collection, data reduction, and correction
for absorption were all conducted using the APEX2 software suite (Bruker
AXS). The structures of [C2mim]2[B12H12] and [C2mim]2[B10H13(OAc)] were solved by direct methods and refined by
full-matrix least squares refinement against F2. Non-hydrogen atoms were located from the difference map
and refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms bonded to boron were located
from the difference map, and their coordinates were allowed to refine
while their thermal parameters were constrained to ride on the carrier
atoms. Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon were placed in calculated positions,
and their coordinates and thermal parameters were constrained to ride
on the carrier atoms.

SCXRD data for [C2mim]2[B10H10] were collected on a Bruker
D8 ADVANCE diffractometer with a PHOTON 100 CMOS area detector and
an IμS microfocus X-ray source (Bruker AXS) using Mo-Kα
radiation. All the non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically.
The ethyl group was modeled as being disordered over two conformations
with the terminal methyl group occupying two positions. The site occupancy
factors and anisotropic thermal parameters were freely refined. Structures
were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares
refinement against F2. Non-hydrogen atoms
were located from the difference map and refined anisotropically.
Hydrogen atoms bonded to boron were located from the difference map,
and hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon were placed in calculated positions.
All hydrogen atom coordinates and thermal parameters were constrained
to ride on the carrier atoms.

The crystal structure of [C2mim]2[B12H12] has unusually
large thermal ellipsoids for carbon atoms on the cations, especially
the ethyl groups, and an exceptionally short C–C single bond.
These are likely artifacts of unresolved disorder. Examination of
the difference map suggests that the carbon atoms of the −CH2– groups might be disordered over two positions. As
the nitrogen atoms are very unlikely to form bond angles deviating
from 120°, disorder at this position suggests that the entire
ring may be disordered over two offset positions, which is a common
form of disorder for aromatic rings. Because the overall scattering
from this crystal was weak, the high angle data is mostly unobserved,
and the usable fraction of the data is at too low of a resolution
to allow the modeling of so many nearly overlapping partial atoms.
Nevertheless, the correct identity of the structure is strongly supported
by the presence of the geometrically distinct [B12H12]2– fragment, the requirements of charge
balance, and isomorphism with the crystal structure of [C2mim][B12F12]. Analysis of another crystal was
not attempted; as the crystal is isomorphous with a known compound,
we do not anticipate any significant findings from a higher resolution
structure.

4.2 Synthetic Methods
Caution: B10H14 is a volatile, highly poisonous
solid, capable of causing permanent health effects at low exposure
levels. Never handle unsealed containers of B10H14 outside of a fume hood, and decontaminate all glassware, utensils,
and materials that come into contact with B10H14 before removing them.

4.3 General Procedure for the
Isolation of Single Crystals of [C2mim]2[B12H12], [C2mim][B(O(BOO)2)2], and [C2mim]2[B10H13(OAc)]
A borosilicate glass culture tube was tared,
and [C2mim][OAc] was weighed into it. B10H14 was handled exclusively in a fume hood by adding it to a
tared, empty screw-cap vial, sealing the vial, weighing it, and adding
or removing B10H14 as needed until the target
mass was achieved. When the needed amount of n-B10H14 was weighed out, the contents of the vial
were emptied onto a sheet of weighing paper and then transferred into
the culture tube containing the IL. The culture tubes were then either
sealed with Parafilm and allowed to stand at room temperature or placed
in a heated sand bath while unsealed. After 1 d, portions of the vitrified
reaction products were examined under a microscope by removing them
with a steel spatula, suspending them in a drop of Paratone oil on
a microscope slide, and removing them from the fume hood once covered
with a layer of oil.

4.4 General Procedure for the
Isolation of Single Crystals of [C2mim]2[B10H10]
A 100 mL round bottom Schlenk flask
was charged with [C2mim][OAc] (0.502 g, 2.94 mmol). The
flask was purged for 5 min with N2 (Linde Gas Canada, Mississauga,
ON). KOtBu (0.0662 g, 0.590 mmol, 0.20
equiv) was added in one portion under N2. After 4 h, B10H14 (0.0539 g, 0.441 mmol) was added to viscous
liquid in one portion under N2. The viscosity increased
progressively, and the product assumed a solid consistency while the
color changed from orange to yellow. After 24 h, an aliquot of the
solid mixture was taken and dissolved in acetonitrile. The solution
was layered with benzene (1:1 v/v). After 1 d, colorless crystals
were isolated and analyzed. An identical procedure with NaH provided
the same results.

4.5 NMR Measurement
B10H14 (0.087 g) was added to [C2mim][OAc] (1.241 g) and stirred for 5 h until complete dissolution
of B10H14 was observed. The color of the mixture
turned from colorless to a more viscous yet free-flowing yellow liquid.
The resulting liquid was loaded into an NMR tube with three sealed
capillaries containing DMSO-d6. 1H-, 13C-, and 11B-NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Ascend 500 spectrometer (500 MHz).
