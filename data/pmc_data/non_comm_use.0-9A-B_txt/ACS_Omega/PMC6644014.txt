This
work investigates the effect of ultrasound on switching of cis azobenzene isomers to their trans counterparts in solid
films of methyl methacrylate and methacryloyloxyazobenzene copolymers
[P(MMA/MOAB)]. Ultraviolet–visible and 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopies demonstrate that 46% of the cis
isomer converts to the trans form purely by ultrasonic agitation and
46% converts to the trans isomer by localized ultrasound-induced heating
effects. Comparative studies of isomerization by ultrasound wave,
heat, and visible irradiation show that ultrasound exposure requires
a longer time to switch the cis-to-trans conformation. The estimated
activation energy for the cis-to-trans conversion in solid polymer
films is shown to be comparable to previous values of azobenzene isomerization,
indicating that incorporation of the chromophore in a polymeric system
affects the kinetics of transition but not the barriers to conformational
change.

1 Introduction
It
is now well-established that stimuli-responsive molecules can
change their molecular shape under appropriate stimuli such as light,
temperature, pH, and mechanical force, allowing the control of physical,
optical, and even mechanical properties of the host materials.1,2 The use of mechanical energy to trigger molecules into different
forms is of great interest because of the possible applications in
optical switching and data storage, liquid crystal displays, molecular
machines, surface relief gratings, nanodevices, and nonlinear optics.3−10

One group of such materials are the azobenzene (AB)-based
chromophores,
which can reversibly alter their isomeric forms between trans (planar,
t-AB) and cis (twisted, c-AB) geometries in response to external stimuli
such as light and heat.11−15 In glassy polymers such as methacrylic polymers, isomerization occurs
through the inversion of the azo (−N=N−) bond
because this mechanism requires a smaller free volume than rotation.16 In the case of AB-based polymers, the distance
between the two benzene rings of the AB chromophore is altered reversibly
by 39% from 9 to 5.5 Å,17,18 resulting in associated
changes in the mechanical properties of a polymer matrix (Figure 1). Previous investigations
of a 10% mol AB-loaded methacrylic polymer film exposed to ultraviolet
(UV) light demonstrated an increase of stiffness by 19% through photo-induced
reorganization of polymer chains during isomerization.19

Figure 1 Reversible isomerization of AB molecule.

Ultrasonic treatment has been shown to affect the
interconversion
of AB molecules in solution, where Surampudi et al.20 reported the ultrasound-induced isomerization of a methyl
acrylate polymer solution containing AB in the main chain. This pivotal
work underpins the study here. However, for everyday usage of these
types of materials, for example, in opto-mechanical devices21,22 and solar thermal energy storage,23 these
materials need to be in a solid form; thus it is important to identify
the nature of the cis → trans (c-AB → t-AB) isomerization
by ultrasound in solid polymers rather than in liquid.

Analogous
to light irradiation, ultrasound will lead to rise in
temperature of a solid or solution of AB polymers. Changes in temperature
during light and ultrasonic treatment of AB-based materials do not
affect the quantum yield of trans → cis (t-AB → c-AB)
isomerization; but the quantum yield decreases significantly for the
c-AB → t-AB isomerization.15 Thus,
the measurement of ultrasound-induced temperature rises in the AB-based
polymer films and their associated isomerization are of great importance
in this type of investigation.

In this paper, we report the
effect of sonication on the switching
of AB isomers (c-AB to t-AB) in polymer thin films. The thermal and
ultrasound-induced contribution to the isomerization modes have been
separated and reported. The activation energy barrier associated with
the cis-to-trans isomerization is also discussed.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN, 98% Sigma-Aldrich) and triethylamine (99.99% Sigma-Aldrich)
were used without further purification. Methyl methacrylate (MMA,
99%), 4-phenylazophenol (98%), methacryloyl chloride (97%), ethanol
(99.9%), and tetrahydrofuran, (THF; 99.9%) were supplied by Alfa Aesar
and used as received.

The synthesis of AB polymers is described
elsewhere.9,24 A typical synthetic scheme is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Polymerization scheme
for the AB polymers.

4-Phenylazophenol was functionalized to a methacryloyloxyazobenzene
(MOAB) monomer by reacting methacryloyl chloride in the presence of
triethylamine (soft base). A series of copolymers of MMA and MOAB
monomers with varying AB loadings were prepared. The monomers were
polymerized to polymethyl methacrylate and polymethacryloyloxyazobenzene
[P(MMA/MOAB)] at 65 °C in THF using 3% mol AIBN as the free-radical
initiator. The reaction mixture was degassed by freeze thaw cycles
prior to polymerization. After 48 h of polymerization, the polymer
was precipitated by adding ethanol. Subsequently, the precipitate
was dissolved in toluene and reprecipitated by adding ethanol to remove
lower molecular weight polymers, and the final polymer was then dried
under vacuum. The precursors, monomer, and polymer structures were
characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as
seen below, and the molecular mass of the polymer was determined by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

2.2 Thin
Film Preparation
Films were
cast by dispersing 5% w/v toluene solution of the polymer (1 mL) onto
microscope glass slides placed onto a level glass table. The solvent
was allowed to evaporate slowly at room temperature for 24 h. The
resultant films were transferred into a vacuum oven where the residual
solvent was removed by continuous pumping for 3 days at room temperature.
Complete dryness of the films was confirmed by periodically monitoring
the mass of a film until a constant mass was reached, and thin films
of 7–9 μm deep were created.

2.3 Structure
Modification
Polymer modification
was performed by ultrasound, heat, and irradiation methods.

2.3.1 Sonication and Structural Changes Analysis
PMMA, P(MMA/MOAB),
and PMOAB films were held in black plastic bags
(solid thin films) and held in a thermostatically controlled aqueous
ultrasonic bath (Grant 400 W) operating at 50–60 kHz at room
temperature, 25, 30, 40, and 50 °C. Solutions of the polymers
for 1H NMR analysis were held in NMR tubes under the same
conditions.

2.3.2 Heat Treatment of Films
Heat treatment
of the polymer systems was performed using the same bath as the sonication
studies but with no ultrasound applied.

2.3.3 Irradiation
of Thin Films
Isomerization
was performed with a xenon lamp (Zeiss, BLX 500/4). The films were
irradiated at room temperature with a 5 mm-diameter light guide using
a Novacure M2100 light source (EXFO Photonic Solutions Inc.). Filters
of wavelength range of 290–320 and 400–500 nm were employed
for obtaining UV and visible light exposure, respectively. The intensity
of light was 1000 mW cm–2 for UV and visible irradiation.
Apart from illuminating sources, the experimental area was kept in
darkness.

2.3.4 Storage
Films
were stored in black
plastic bags and within a black container when not in use or when
being subjected to ultrasound.

2.4 Characterization
2.4.1 Monitoring of Temperature
Thermal
measurements of the ultrasound processing were made using a K-type
thermocouple (RS Components UK), either mounted alone for calibration
measurements or attached to the films while undergoing sonication.

2.4.2 Study of Structural Changes
Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrometry was performed with a Zeiss, MCS 522 UV
VIS spectrometer, and the films were removed periodically from the
systems described above to record the UV–vis spectra.

1H NMR spectroscopy analysis was carried out on a Bruker
500 MHz spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as the internal reference
and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent.

A typical
trace of the t-AB → c-AB isomerization in a 20%
mol P(MMA/MOAB) thin film exposed to UV radiation at 25 °C is
given in Figure 3a.
The spectrum has two distinct absorption bands: 318 nm which is attributed
to the trans isomers due to the π–π* transition
state and 440 nm corresponding to the cis isomers due to the forbidden
n−π* transition.25 The absorbance
band at 318 nm sharply decreases and the weak band at 440 nm increases
after UV irradiation. Complete t-AB → c-AB isomerization is
accomplished after 300 s.

Figure 3 UV–vis spectra of the 20% P(MMA/MOAB)
film after (a) UV
irradiation, (b) visible irradiation, and (c) exposure to ultrasound
waves and increase/decrease direction of individual peaks.

Figure 3b presents
the c-AB → t-AB isomerization of the same film under the same
conditions but under exposure to visible light. The trans band at
318 nm increases noticeably after visible irradiation and the cis
band at 440 nm decreases with irradiation time. Complete c-AB →
t-AB isomerization of AB in the polymers is accomplished after 30
s of exposure to visible light. The rate of c-AB → t-AB conversion
is expected to be faster than the t-AB → c-AB conversion because
the trans form is thermodynamically more favorable (∼55 kJ
mol–1 energy difference ΔHf(cis) = 367 kJ mol–1, ΔHf(trans) = 312 kJ mol–1) than
the cis form, and thus the overall reaction rate is dominated by the
trans isomeric direction.

The effect of ultrasound on the isomerization
in this film can
be seen in Figure 3c. As with treatment by visible light, the intensity of the 318 nm
trans peak increases with sonication time and the intensity of the
440 nm cis peak decreases, showing that switching of c-AB →
t-AB occurs in the solid films when exposed to ultrasound. Complete
recovery of the cis isomers to the trans conformation in a 20% mol
AB copolymer is achieved within 7200 s, which is significantly longer
than the recovery time by visible light (30 s). Similar recovery behaviors
were observed in all polymer films containing different AB loadings,
and the results are shown in Table 1.

The conversion rate to the trans form by visible
light is much
faster (30–60 s) than by sonication (7200–9000 s) because
visible irradiation stimulates only the c-AB → t-AB isomerization,
whereas sonication can trigger both t-AB → c-AB and c-AB →
t-AB isomerization reactions.15

Ultrasound
and photo-induced isomerization in the copolymer films
were further confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of the pretreated film (Figure 4a) shows three broad signals for the protons
of the benzene ring of the trans AB pendant: δ 7.87–8.05
(4H), δ 7.48–7.62 (3H), and δ 7.20–7.43
(2H) ppm. Additional signals at δ 6.75–7.20 ppm (Figure 4b), attributed to
the aromatic protons from the cis configuration of AB in the polymeric
chain,26 appeared after 10 min of UV irradiation,
whereas the intensity of the signals due to trans isomers decreased
indicating t-AB → c-AB isomerization of the AB chromophores.

Figure 4 1H NMR spectra of the 10% P(MMA/MOAB) film. (a) Untreated
sample (97.4% trans and 2.6% cis), (b) UV irradiated (23.7% trans
and 76.3% cis), (c) 60 min sonication (48.3% trans and 51.7% cis),
and (d) 120 min sonication (90.5% trans and 9.5% cis).

When the UV-treated film with cis conformation
was exposed to ultrasound
waves for 60 min, the intensity of the chemical shifts at δ
6.75–7.20 ppm (Figure 4c) decreased to 48.3%, which is attributed to c-AB →
t-AB isomerization. Further treatment of this film with ultrasound
demonstrated 91% recovery of the trans isomers within 120 min, as
seen in Figure 3d.
The UV–vis and 1H NMR spectroscopic results are
in good agreement, confirming that ultrasound can trigger the c-AB
→ t-AB isomerization of polymer thin films when AB chromophores
are in the side chains. Whereas the NMR measurements are in solution
rather than in the solid state, they give a strong measure of confidence
that the data given in Figure 3 is meaningful and that conformational changes in the loaded
polymeric systems are occurring.

A comparison of the time required
for complete c-AB → t-AB
conversion (Supporting Information Figure
S1) after exposure to ultrasound waves and visible light shows that
all P(MMA/MOAB) compositions achieve the same total conversion, suggesting
that the AB concentration plays no significant role in the mechanism
of c-AB → t-AB isomerization. There is some variation of rate
constant with composition (Table 1), implying that the kinetics of the process change
but not the underlying mechanism. This general trend for higher rate
constants with increased AB loading can be attributed to steric hindrance
occurring during the polymer transformation, simply slowing the process
down; however, the possibility of entropic chain stretching of the
network may be another factor.

3.2 Effects
of Ultrasound
The quantum
yield of t-AB → c-AB is not substantially altered by temperature
but approaches zero at about 110 K for c-AB → t-AB isomerization.
This indicates a strong dependence of thermal vibrations15 leading to an expectation that ultrasound will
increase the temperature of the AB-containing films during sonication.
Initial tests showed that a 20% mol P(MMA/MOAB) thin film at 25 °C,
which completes c-AB → t-AB isomerization within 7200 s, is
subject to appreciable heat during ultrasound treatment.

To
observe the ultrasound-induced heating of the sample, the temperature
of the ultrasonic bath was continuously monitored during ultrasound
treatment. A typical heating curve of the bath temperature during
ultrasonic treatment is shown in Figure 5. This shows that when the bath temperature
is held at 20 °C, there was an increase in the temperature of
the bath by approximately 20 °C within ∼120 min. Aligned
to this is a calibration of the effects of heat on c-AB → t-AB
conversion, without the input of ultrasound.

Figure 5 Thermal heating for a
bath at room temperature undergoing sonication.

Individual samples were placed in the heating bath and removed
at appropriate temperatures, and then the absorbance was immediately
measured for the given temperature. This gives a measure of the thermal
contribution for any specific temperature, effectively a “background”
removal.

This value can then be subtracted from the values of
absorbance
generated by ultrasound at that given temperature, giving a value
of both the thermal and ultrasonic components of conversion. The temperature–time
plot in Figure 5 is
important, as the heating ramp is not linear.

Figure 6 shows the
amount of cis isomers that was reverted to the trans counterparts
in a 20% mol P(MMA/MOAB) thin film by heating in a bath at the described
rate from 20 to 40 °C and also by ultrasonic treatment of this
film contained in a bath at 20 °C.

Figure 6 Cis-to-trans conversion
of 20% P(MMA/MOAB) thin films after exposure
to heat (blue diamond) and sonication (brown square).

It clearly shows that at every measured temperature,
the level
of c-AB → t-AB conversion is greater for the sonically treated
films compared to those that are simply heat-treated. This means that
the conversion of c-AB → t-AB is caused by the interaction
of ultrasound with the polymeric film, not just from the associated
temperature rise due to sonication of the surrounding media. The difference
at low temperatures between the sonicated and heated samples is ascribed
to the faster effect of the sonication than the more gradual heating
effect.

Not only is the total amount of c-AB → t-AB conversion
greater
for sonication rather than pure heating, the rate of conversion is
also greater in the sonically treated films. The temperature profile
for the purely heated system is effectively linear across the heating
range, whereas for the ultrasonically treated films, the linearity
occurs after ∼23 °C. The behavior at lower temperatures
of the ultrasonically treated films can be readily explained by the
different modes by which the heating occurs; in the purely heated
system, the temperature is well-controlled by the surrounding heat
sink environment; in the ultrasonic case, it is caused by the (unthermostated)
ultrasonic agitation, thus when initiated, the system takes a little
time to settle down into a steady state, which it does shortly after
the ultrasonic treatment begins.

An initial GPC of untreated
samples shows that 8% of the material
is in the trans form. This can then be assigned to the initial UV–vis
spectra peak height. By purely heating a sample and then removing
it at specific times/temperature (as defined by the curve in Figure 4) and measuring the
associated cis-to-trans isomerism, the contribution given by pure
heating can be established. Repeating this for the samples undergoing
sonication and calculating the difference in peak heights allow the
contribution of sonication to be established (Figure S2).

Using this as a calibration and examining
the amounts of converted
c-AB → t-AB forms, we estimate that the heating effect causes
∼46% of the conversion and that pure ultrasonic agitation causes
∼46% of the reverse isomerization for the total isomerization.
The remaining 8% remained in the trans form. Sonication must have
an effect upon the polymer outside that of heating and most likely
is due to the sonic treatment upon the amorphous polymer itself, causing
changes in the isomerization state. If it were purely due to the heating
effect on the surrounding liquid, then such a disparity in the amounts
transformed would not have been observed. Although the heating and
sonication contributions are approximately equal, this is simply an
attribute of this material, and we would expect other materials to
have different contributions.

This finding is at variance with
the findings of Surampudi et al.20 who
reported a 100% recovery of c-AB →
t-AB isomer in an AB polymer solution by ultrasound treatment. However,
Surampudi et al did not exclude possible heating effects because of
expected temperature rises of the solution during ultrasound treatment,
and the current study is examining both a different system and the
one that is in the solid state, rather than a solution. In the solution
state, any generated heat can be more easily dissipated in the enveloping
media, whereas in the solid state, the heat loss will be primarily
due to conductive processes, which in general will occur much more
slowly for an organic solid—there is as yet no definitive data
for the thermal conductivity or heat capacity for these AB-based polymeric
films, although bulk PMMA has a thermal heat conductivity of ∼0.19
W m–1 K–1.27

PMMA is an amorphous polymer, and it is well-established
that the
thermal properties of such systems are anisotropic with the randomness
of the polymer chains limiting the phonon free path within the system.28 However, imposing an external structure on the
polymer will then affect the thermal properties, whether that is a
fiber where thermal parameters along the fiber axis are well-understood
but radial thermal parameters are not29 or as in this case, where a thin film is employed leading to a two-dimensional
character. In addition, these initial differences due to structure
are then enhanced by the internal changes brought about by the isomerization
processes and may play a part in the fatigue of these systems.

Our findings show that c-AB → t-AB isomerization in solid
polymer films can be triggered ultrasonically, but it increases the
temperature of the sample, which can enhance both c-AB → t-AB
and t-AB → c-AB. This finding suggests that the cis isomer
calculated from NMR spectroscopy analysis in Figure 4 is overestimated because both heating effects
were excluded from the results and they examine solution, rather than
the solid forms.

3.3 Pseudokinetics of Isomerization
In
an attempt to better define the kinetics of the system, the absorbance
values at 318 nm collected in an isothermal manner were examined (a
typical trace being given in Figure 3c). The kinetics of change in intensity was modelled
by eq 1(20) 1  where A∞ is the
absorbance of the film at time 150 min, A0 is the initial absorbance, and At is the absorbance value at time t. Typical
plots of ln(A∞ – At)/(A∞ – A0) as a function
of ultrasonic treatment time for 20% P(MMA/MOAB)
at various temperatures are given in Figure S3a–d in the Supporting Information. Of the four temperature
runs, it is clear that those performed at 25 and 50 °C have two
distinct gradient regions, the first slope passing through zero and
the second slope not passing through zero. This indicates that the
initial process is a first-order process, but is followed later by
a process that is not a first-order process. For the runs at 35 and
40 °C, there appears to be only one process, which is first order.
The first-order rate constants derived range from 0.03 to 1.10 h–1, (dependent upon the temperature) which compare favorably
to previous reports11 of 0.61 and 0.91
h–1 for this class of polymer in a THF solution.
The rate constants for 25 and 50 °C, which are not first order,
lie between 0.01 and 0.16 h–1, which are lower than
those previously cited but within the same order of magnitude; so
most likely reflect simple mechanistic changes rather than major ones
or they may possibly reflect the pseudoisothermal nature of the data.

The activation energy of this process was calculated from the Arrhenius
plot, as shown in Figure S4, and is found
to be 111(1) kJ mol–1, which lies very close to
the data cited by Bandara and Burdette, who reported the activation
energy for the AB chromophore c-AB → t-AB isomerization in
solution15 to be 95 kJ mol–1, for the melt to be 105 kJ mol–1, and for crystalline
materials to be 233 kJ mol–1.

Although this
value appears reasonable, it must be approached with
a modicum of suspicion. As noted in a previous section, although these
runs were made in the isothermal mode, the ultrasonic agitation does
cause heating, and hence these data are not isothermal. However, given
that the logarithmic plots do show a strong degree of linearity, the
data suggest that it is a useful estimation to give. With the temperature
calibration included (and a worst case heating scenario in place),
this increases to ∼126 kJ mol–1 for the polymer
system. This suggests that whatever the exact temperature, the thermal
barriers to reorganization in this polymeric system do not particularly
hinder the mechanism(s) that occurs and that thermal barriers to switching
are not enhanced by AB chromophores being restricted by the physical
cross-links in the polymers. The smaller rate of reaction of t-AB
→ c-AB isomerization in the solid polymer film is attributed
to the restricted conformational changes in the rigid polymer matrix.
It is common that a change in the structures and matrices can change
the rate of isomerization by stimuli such as light and dark.30 The impact of structural features of AB derivatives
on cis-to-trans isomerization kinetics was reported by Bujak et al.
The authors found dark-return cis-to-trans isomer to be twice as faster
for azopyridine derivatives than for their AB analogues.

4 Conclusions
It has been shown that ultrasonic agitation
of the P(MMA/MOAB)
solid thin films does trigger c-AB → t-AB isomer confirmation,
and after discounting the thermal isomerization effect, the isomerization
due to pure ultrasound could be observed to be about 46% in 2 h, with
46% being contributed by ultrasound-induced thermal excitation, the
remainder being untransformed trans isomers. It may appear to be a
philosophical question whether solid-state transitions are purely
induced by ultrasound or by the thermal response to ultrasound, but
it is important to be able to define the two components as they do
have different impacts. Clearly pure ultrasound can wholly convert
cis-to-trans conformations (at least in solution20) and thermal effects can also drive the counter trans-to-cis
switch, which, if not understood and quantified, can lead to problems
in further work or applications.

In demonstrating the ultrasound-induced
switching of cis AB isomers
to their trans counterparts in solid polymer films, it is clear that
the incorporation of the AB chromophore does not affect the thermal
barriers to conformational change. However, within a more complex
solid structure, this hinders the capacity for physical reorganization
required for switching such molecular structures, say compared to
solution-based systems, and leads to slower interconversion. Although
this decrease in the switching time can be a problem (if fast switching
times are required), it can also clearly be a benefit if slow times
are necessary, for example, in stimuli-responsive drug-delivery systems31 and protein immobilization.32

This work advances our understanding of the vibration-induced
isomerization
and indicates where material functions, such as fatigue behavior of
AB-based materials, can and do occur when used for various applications
such as optical–mechanical devices, solar thermal energy storage,
and reversible data storage.

Studies to further define the properties
of these materials are
ongoing, for example, to fully understand the influence of strength
and frequency of ultrasound on the behavior of these materials, developing
mechanical and analytical methods to study fatigue processes, and
truly defining isothermal conditions to permit a more consistent and
coherent measure of the activation energy of transformation and, of
course, to develop new materials with enhanced properties.
