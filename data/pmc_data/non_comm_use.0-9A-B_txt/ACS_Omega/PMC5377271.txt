In
this work, a comprehensive methodology for the fitting of single-walled
carbon nanotube absorption spectra is presented. Different approaches
to background subtraction, choice of line profile, and calculation
of full width at half-maximum are discussed both in the context of
previous literature and the contemporary understanding of carbon nanotube
photophysics. The fitting is improved by the inclusion of exciton–phonon
sidebands, and new techniques to improve the individualization of
overlapped nanotube spectra by exploiting correlations between the
first- and second-order optical transitions and the exciton–phonon
sidebands are presented. Consideration of metallic nanotubes allows
an analysis of the metallic/semiconducting content, and a process
of constraining the fit of highly congested spectra of carbon nanotube
solid films according to the spectral weights of each (n, m) species in solution is also presented, allowing
for more reliable resolution of overlapping peaks into single (n, m) species contributions.

Introduction
Single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs) are an intensively studied
nanomaterial and our fundamental understanding of their unique electronic,
physical, chemical, and optical properties has steadily increased
over the past 2 decades.1 This has been
accompanied by an explosion of applications-based research into SWCNTs
in all fields of science from photonics,2−4 telecommunications,5 solar cells,6,7 batteries,8 fuel cells,9 high-frequency
transistors,10 biosensors,11 and novel memory devices,12 through
to sports equipment and cancer research.7,13−15 Amongst other characteristics, it is their structure-dependent optical
properties that make SWCNTs such an interesting material. Optical
absorption spectroscopy of SWCNTs reveals sets of diameter-dependent
absorption bands in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelength
regimes, corresponding to the discrete energetic transitions of this
one-dimensional nanomaterial. These are labeled the first (S11), second (S22), and third (S33) transitions
of a (semiconducting) SWCNT and were originally modeled using the
single particle approximation.16 However,
two-photon excitation experiments have since revealed the excitonic
nature of SWCNT optical transitions and theoretical models have been
modified to include confined electron–electron interactions
and exciton binding energies by solving the Bethe–Salpeter
equation.17,18 Distinctions have been made between dissimilar
SWCNTs based on their chirality, as indicated by the (n, m) indices, with each semiconducting chirality
possessing a unique set of S11, S22, and S33 transition energies, and where small changes in the chiral
angle and diameter can cause large changes in the optical and electronic
properties of a nanotube. Many different (n, m) species and electronic types of SWCNTs (metallic and
semiconducting) are present within as-grown nanotubes, and theoretical
calculations, verified by experimental observations, have established
databases of the unique optical “fingerprint” associated
with each species.19

In the case
of semiconducting SWCNTs, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy,
and the ability to measure two-dimensional PL contour maps, has allowed
for further experimental verification of each nanotube’s optical
fingerprint and has provided an essential tool in the qualitative
determination of the (n, m) distribution
of as-grown SWCNT powders.20 However, the
insensitivity of PL measurements to metallic SWCNTs, and the strongly
varying quantum yield between (n, m) species, especially for zig-zag nanotubes,21−23 has resulted in a PL-based quantitative assessment of the (n, m) distribution remaining elaborate
and difficult. Despite this, advances in the physical information
that can be obtained with this technique continue to be made and the
level of finesse with which PL spectra can be individualized into
single (n, m) contributions and
analyzed is improving.24−27 Raman spectral mapping may offer an alternative solution in the
future but currently suffers from the need for elaborate tunable excitation
sources. In addition to that, highly structure-dependent and unknown
sensitivity factors exacerbate the interpretation of the measurement
data.28 A much newer addition to the toolbox
of spectroscopic probes of carbon nanotubes is variance spectroscopy.29 This is a fluorescence-based technique that
can provide excellent quantitative information on the (n, m) distribution of a polychiral material, as well
as extract single-species spectra from such mixtures, and which will
no doubt have a significant research impact as the required equipment
and software become more prevalent. However, due in part to its broad
applicability beyond the realm of carbon nanotubes, optical absorption
spectroscopy will remain the most widely available and easily accessible
technique in the near future and is still considered the preferred
method for concentration, electronic purity, and (n, m) determination.30

The extraction of physical information from simple optical
measurements
has allowed for the rapid development of chirality-enriched growth
techniques31 and sorting processes, such
as gel permeation,32,33 density-gradient ultracentrifugation,34 phase extraction,35 and polymer wrapping.36 All of these
sorting techniques have been shown to produce single chirality SWCNTs,
in some cases up to milligram quantities, and this new availability
of material has in turn led to a further increase in applications-based
research with SWCNTs. As single chirality SWCNTs move from being an
exotic nanomaterial that is available in only a few research laboratories
to something commonly available from commercial suppliers, it is imperative
that methods of standardization are developed. Indeed, to this end,
the ISO Technical Specification ISO/TS 10868:2011 (currently under
revision)37 establishes broad guidelines
for the optical characterization of SWCNTs and the US-based National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released (6, 5) SWCNTs
grown from the CoMoCat process and prepared under standardized conditions,
as well as a basic “How-To Guide” for near infrared
measurements of large diameter, arc discharge SWCNTs.38

Throughout the work in our laboratories, we have
repeatedly found
the need to reliably decongest the optical absorption spectra of single-/few-chirality,
as well as polychiral, SWCNT samples and have, thus endeavored to
develop a practical, yet robust, system of doing so. Of course, there
are several software packages available for the generic fitting of
multipeak spectra, each with a plethora of options for how the peaks
should be approximated. However, the resultant fitting output rapidly
loses physical significance as the number of peaks and their degree
of congestion becomes excessive. Factors such as the type of background
subtraction employed and the line shape used to approximate the various
peaks are critical in obtaining accurate information from the decongestion
process. Naturally, one can generate the “best” fit
by simply using the largest number of adjustable parameters; however,
each of these parameters should have its origin in real physical processes
or the reliability, reproducibility, and usefulness of the obtained
information are questionable.

Therefore, in the present work,
a significantly improved method
for decongesting carbon nanotube optical absorption spectra is provided
that is grounded in the underlying physical processes and takes advantage
of several unique characteristics of the material to markedly improve
the quality and accuracy of the obtained information, particularly
in the case of the polychiral and highly overlapped spectra that those
in the carbon nanotube research community are routinely faced with,
for example, in the development of new sorting or growth processes
in which the (n, m) distribution
can sometimes be large and unknown.39 The
common background subtraction procedures reported in the literature,
the various line profiles that have been used, and (n, m) specific absorption databases have been combined
with the current state-of-the-art in understanding of carbon nanotube
photophysics to develop a comprehensive methodology for the quantitative
characterization and (n, m) assignment
of SWCNT spectra. Values of interest such as the (n, m) distribution and semiconducting purity can
be determined quickly and reproducibly from the spectra of a polychiral
material.

In the simplest case, the S11 and/or S22 regions
of a spectrum can be fitted independently using one of several methods
as previously reported. To this, we add the new ability to also consider
the well-established, and in some cases very significant, contribution
of the exciton–phonon sideband (EPS) to the spectra. The inclusion
of this nanotube-specific, real-world constraint should significantly
improve the accuracy and relevance of the output, particularly in
the case of polychiral spectra. This work then takes the fitting process
a step further by providing the option to fit the entire spectrum
simultaneously, including the S11 and S22 peaks,
and their respective EPS contributions. Such a heavily constrained
fitting is only possible in this case because of the well-defined
relationships that exist between the physical processes underlying
the features observed in carbon nanotube optical absorption spectra,
and the existence of complete databases and formulae of the measured
energies/wavelengths, and goes beyond anything that can be achieved
using generic multipeak fitting software packages. As a further useful
addition, in the common case of a polychiral nanotube suspension being
used to prepare a solid film, the initial (n, m) assignment and spectral weight data obtained from a fit
of the solution spectrum can be used to constrain the fitting of the
film’s much more heavily congested spectrum, for which the
real-world relevance of any fitting procedure would otherwise be questionable.
Naturally, as with any decongestion and fitting procedure, there are
limitations to the minimum degree of uncertainty that can be obtained,
as discussed later. Throughout this work, we have attempted to bring
together the theoretical framework and understanding underlying carbon
nanotube optical absorption spectra into a single, accessible resource
for researchers who need to deal with such spectra, as well as to
provide a useful, practical, and robust fitting tool for both expert
and novice alike. The work is structured such that the article gives
an overview of the theory and review of the literature, as well as
some important examples, the Supporting Information file provides more detailed and specific descriptions of fitting
processes and mathematical derivations, and the MATLAB code and LabVIEW-based
graphical user interface allow readers to implement the entire fitting
process in their own work.

Results and Discussion
In the decongestion
of carbon nanotube absorption spectra into
individual (n, m) contributions,
and the determination of the spectral weight of each species and metallic
content, the analyst is faced with many decisions regarding the appropriate
model to best approximate their measured data. These decisions include:
determination of the spectral regions associated with metallic or
semiconducting nanotubes and their respective (n, m) dependent optical
transitions, the spectral line shape, the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) and whether this is a fixed or variable parameter amongst (n, m) species, the appropriate S11 to S22 height or area ratio, consideration of EPS contributions
and their proper magnitude relative to the main peaks, and, before
any of this can be done, what type of background subtraction, if any,
should be applied to the spectra. In the following discussion, we
will first address the theoretical basis and implications of these
factors and then demonstrate their application and some important
considerations in their results.

Background Subtraction
The initial
decision regarding
background subtraction is extremely important as it affects all of
the subsequent steps in the fitting process and can result in markedly
different (n, m) distributions being
calculated. The background in carbon nanotube absorption spectra emerges
from a high-energy component often attributed to a π–plasmon interaction and overall scattering
from carbonaceous materials, catalyst particles, and bundled or defected
nanotubes.40,41 For aqueous suspensions of SWCNTs,
Nair et al.,40 Naumov et al.,41 and Ohmori et al.42 have all presented different approaches to deal with the absorption
background. With the aid of sequential centrifugation and difference
spectra, Ohmori et al. were able to almost completely remove the contribution
from the scattering background in SWCNT spectra and were left with
only the high-energy π–plasmon interaction, which they
fitted with a Lorentzian.42 Naumov et al.
provided additional experimental evidence that the shape of the background
is dependent on metallic nanotube content, chemical modification,
defect level, and the formation of bundles.41 In their work, a background profile in the form Ae(−bλ) was found to best
accommodate this contribution, with A being the Beer
Law proportionality constant, which depends linearly on concentration.
Alternatively, Nair et al. empirically determined the form k/λb, based on the work
of Ryabenko et al.,43 to best approximate
their spectra of highly functionalized carbon nanotubes.40 In a recent publication, Tian et al. proposed
a new routine for background subtraction of carbon nanotube films
based on an overlap of Fano and Lorentzian line shapes.39 The Fano component models the strong coupling
of an exciton around the M saddle point of the graphene lattice Brillouin
zone (∼4.5 eV) to an underlying free electron–hole pair
continuum and is very sensitive to bundling.44 The Lorentzian component models the π-plasmon resonance (∼5.3
eV), as suggested by Landi et al.45 The
Fano profile is proportional to (a + ε)2/(1 + ε2) with “a” being a fitting parameter and ε = (E – Eres)/(Γ/2), where E is the energy, Eres the peak
position of the Fano profile, and Γ its FWHM.46 To exemplify the critical importance of background subtraction, Figure 1 compares the approaches
outlined by (a) Nair, (c) Naumov, and (e) Tian, showing how the corresponding
(n, m) distributions subsequently
calculated can differ considerably, particularly at the edges of the
wavelength region, that is, for the (n, m) species (9, 7) (2.56, 4.22, and 2.36% for the methods based on
Nair et al., Naumov et al., and Tian et al., respectively) and (10,
6) (0.08, 1.83, and 0.08% for the methods based on Nair et al., Naumov
et al., and Tian et al., respectively) on the long wavelength side,
and (9, 1) (0.25, 0.22, and 0.44% for the methods based on Nair et
al., Naumov et al., and Tian et al., respectively) on the short wavelength
side, as listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The result of these considerations
is that irrespective of the background subtraction method employed
the degree of uncertainty in any quantitative information obtained
for (n, m) species near the edges
of the considered wavelength range will always be greater than that
for those in the middle of the range. In addition, it must be mentioned
that the issue of “correct” background shape and the
various parameters contributing to it are still under investigation
and debate. The large number of different nanotube preparation methods
and media available for their suspension, means that a one size-fits-all
approach to background subtraction is unlikely to be possible and
the backgrounds found in the literature can only serve as a guide.
Therefore, in the included code in the Supporting Information it is possible to not only use the background shapes
defined in the literature but also to input any arbitrary reference
plot data as the background. We hope that this feature will provide
the flexibility to analyze a broad spectrum of different nanotube
suspensions and enable the further study of background shapes in the
future.

Figure 1 Three different background subtraction methods proposed by Nair
et al. (a), Naumov et al. (c), and Tian et al. (e).39−41 The measured
absorption spectra are shown in black and the background profiles
in red. The different background subtraction techniques result in
comparable (n, m) distributions for shorter wavelengths in (b) and (d) but clearly
deviate for (f). Above 1300 nm, (b) and (f) are comparable, whereas
(d) clearly deviates, e.g., in the contribution of (9, 7) or (10,
6). A representative PL measurement is shown in Figure S1.

Spectral Line Shape
The choice of correct line shape
to be used for the individual (n, m) species fitting has varied in the literature. However, it is accepted
that a symmetric line shape can be used to fit optical absorption
measurements.47 Luo et al.21 and Ohmori et al.42 used Lorentzian
line shapes, whereas Nair et al.,40 Naumov
et al.,41 and Hagen et al.48 used Voigtian line shapes, and Lolli et al.49 fitted their data using Gaussian line profiles.
In theory, the Voigt function is best suited to fully capture the
underlying physical processes that give rise to SWCNT absorption spectra,
that is, a convolution of a single finite excited state lifetime (Lorentzian)50,51 and a random distribution of transition frequencies from heterogeneous
environments (Gaussian), including thermal effects that might play
a minor role.52 Or, to put it briefly,
the shape is essentially Lorentzian, but with variable Gaussian broadening.52 Detailed descriptions of the Voigt, Lorentz,
and Gauss expressions used in this work can be found in the Supporting Information.

FWHM
Following
the selection of line shape, the FWHM
must be defined. Similar to the choice of line profile, different
empirical approaches for estimating the FWHM have been presented in
the literature. Nair et al. divided their absorption spectra into
three regions: S11, S22, and M11 for
metallic SWCNTs,40 and for each region
they assumed a fixed FWHM in energy space. A related approach was
carried out by Hagen et al., who assumed a fixed FWHM for S11 transitions below 1.4 eV.53 Lolli et
al. and Naumov et al. assumed a constant FWHM in wavenumber units.41,49 On the basis of the fitting data provided by Ohmori et al.,42 Tune et al., as well as Liu et al., proposed
a linear increase in FWHM with increasing nanotube diameter (in energy
space).54,55 Recently, Kadria-Villi et al. suggested
a diameter-dependent FWHM in cm–1 for PL measurements.56 In the examples provided in the main text, the
FWHM of Lorentzian and Gaussian functions were modeled on the values
provided by Nair et al. as they were found to provide the best fit
for our particular nanotube suspensions.40 For comparison, Figure S2 shows both
the initial and fitted FWHM values for a constant FWHM in eV and in
nm,40 or with a diameter dependent,56 or E11 dependence.55 The initial value in energy space was converted into wavelength
and allowed to vary between 80% and 130%. These boundary conditions
were determined based on numerous absorption spectra of monochiral,
(n, m) enriched, and polychiral
nanotube dispersions in aqueous and organic solutions. Nevertheless,
in the code provided in the Supporting Information, it is possible to change the boundary conditions or use any of
the other approaches for FWHM estimation by defining an equation to
estimate the start values.

The definition of an initial value
for the FWHM of the Voigtian line shape is complicated by the fact
that it is a convolution of a Gaussian and Lorentzian line profile.
Nevertheless, Olivero et al. provided an analytic expression for the
Voigtian FWHM as a function of the Lorentzian and Gaussian FWHM,57 as shown in eq 1 and in eq S21–S26 1  To calculate Voigtian line profiles, several
different approaches have been proposed, including numerical approximations
of the Faddeeva, and therefore complex error function (eqs S27 and S28),58−60 Fourier transformations,
and weighted sums of Lorentzian and Gaussian line shapes.61−63 In the present work, the procedure outlined by Schreier58 for the rapid approximation of the Faddeeva
function was used in combination with the MATLAB implementations from
Cherkasov.64 Thus, the Voigtian function
was expressed in terms of the complex error function, as shown in
the Supporting Information.

Exciton–Phonon
Sidebands
Being excitonic in
nature, the analysis of the optical properties of carbon nanotubes
has revealed sidebands that are assigned to resonances emerging from
the absorption of light by a bound exciton–phonon state.65,66 According to the work of Perebeinos et al., an EPS can be assigned
to optical nanotube transitions and is located ∼0.2 eV above
the peak energy.66 Dynamic effects lead
to the transfer of a fraction of the spectral weight from the main
nanotube peak to the EPS, and the magnitude of this transfer scales
inversely with the diameter, as shown in eq S33.66 It is, therefore, crucial to consider
EPS contributions when analyzing absorption spectra, especially for
monochiral or chirality-enriched suspensions, as pointed out by Berciaud
et al.,67 and demonstrated in Figure S4. For polychiral solutions, it may be
reasonable to consider only the EPS of the most intense peaks, as
any EPS of smaller peaks will have only a small effect on the overall
fit. In analyzing PL spectra, Jones et al. and Rocha et al. proposed
fitting the EPS with Lorentzian line profiles with a fixed FWHM of
18 meV (Jones), or twice the FWHM of the S11 peak (Rocha).26,27 With its sharp onset and long tail toward higher energies, the EPS
is asymmetric in nature.66 However, in
the present study, the EPS contribution was approximated with a symmetric
line profile to simplify the computation. The decision was made to
fit the sharp onset of the EPS peak with a Gaussian line shape to
minimize interference with the modeling of the nanotube absorption,
which would occur by fitting the broad tail. In this work the default
initial FWHM of the EPS was empirically determined to be 40 nm.

Initial Peak Heights
One of the most crucial factors
in obtaining a physically meaningful fit is the choice of the initial
starting values of the peak heights of each (n, m) species. In the case of near-monochiral suspensions,
the determination of the initial starting value is straightforward
as it is given simply by the peak height in the absorption measurement.
However, in the case of polychiral mixtures, the determination of
starting values is complicated by spectral overlap. Nair et al. proposed
a weighting scheme that is reliant on peaks being flanked by a valley
to their right and left.40 They provided
an automated routine to determine these parameters and also offered
the possibility to insert peaks and valleys manually. Tian et al.
introduced a different weighting scheme based on the sum of the two-norm
of the residuals and the spectral weight multiplied by a prefactor,
which was obtained empirically.68 Luo et
al. and Wang et al. proposed a combined approach of correlating PL
intensities and optical absorption spectra via an assumed log-normal
distribution of the SWCNT diameters and an electron–phonon
model that provided them with S22 absorption extinction
coefficients.21,69 On the basis of these absorption
coefficients and the PL intensities, they calculated the peak intensities
of each (n, m) species in the optical
absorption. The pitfall in their approach is the low PL quantum yield
of zig-zag nanotubes that might cause an underrepresentation of these
tubes in the optical absorption spectrum and therefore an unphysical
fit.22 The approach used in the present
study is shown in Figure 2, where the absorption value of the spectrum to be fitted,
at the wavelength corresponding to each (n, m) species to be included, is taken as the starting value
for the peak height of that species and is allowed to vary between
10 and 90%. This method is useful for broad, congested spectral features
from many nanotubes. A further alternative method is shown in Figure S5 and is included as an option in the
fitting routine provided.

Figure 2 Schematic procedure of height assignment for
peaks 1 and 2, where
the height of the individual (n, m) species is allowed to vary between 10 and 90% of the initial height.

To make a quantitative comparison
between fits of a particular
spectrum, the quality of the fit can be determined by calculating
the normalized sum of squared errors (nSSE), as described in eq 2, where ycalc is the fitted spectrum, ymeas is the absorption measurement, and  is the
mean value of the measurement. It
is important to mention that the nSSE is equal to 1-R2, where R2(70) is a common measure of goodness of fit in regression analysis
in statistics.71 The numerator in eq 2 is equal to the sum of
squared residuals or the sum of squared errors of prediction.72 The denominator is the total sum of squares,
indicating the deviation from the mean value and causing a normalization
of the result. The closer the nSSE is to 0, the better the fit. 2  A comparison of the
different
line profiles and their associated nSSE are shown in Figure S6.

Selection of (n, m) Species
to Fit
The final, critical, consideration is that of the
choice of (n, m) species to be fitted
under a given spectrum. It is simply not possible to take a polychiral
absorption spectrum and extract the (n, m) abundance by some kind of generic multipeak fitting procedure.
However, with a good understanding of the underlying photophysics,
and with databases of measured transition energies, combined with
information from other characterization techniques such as PL or Raman
measurement, it is possible to obtain useful information. In the examples
in this work, PL was used to first qualitatively determine the (n, m) species to be included in the fit.
The validity of this approach was verified by taking two different
solutions enriched in (6, 5) and (7, 5), and mixing them in known
ratios of 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2. By comparing the concentrations of (6,
5) and (7, 5) in the starting solutions to the measured and calculated
concentrations in the mixtures, a relative error of 10.8 ± 2.5%
was obtained, as shown in Figures S7 and S8. These experiments highlight the level of accuracy and internal
consistency of the fitting routine used to determine the ratio of
(6, 5):(7, 5) as it is reliant upon an accurate, reproducible spectral
fit of the range between 900 and 1250 nm consisting of six different
(n, m) species and their associated
EPS.

Spectral Weight and (n, m)
Distribution
Each (n, m) species has a different absorption cross section, and experimentally
determined values can be found in the literature.47,55,73 Although a full set of measured values is
not yet available, Sanchez et al. provided an empirically derived
formula for estimating the absorption cross section and molar absorptivity
of different (n, m) species based
on their diameter.47 For the calculation
of the (n, m) distribution, either
the spectral weight (area under an individual peak, divided by the
total area under the region of the spectrum considered) or the relative
concentration based on the optical density and molar absorptivity
(as shown in eq S35) can be employed. An
example of the spectral weight and relative concentration calculated
in the aforementioned ways is shown in Figure 3. Spectra of the polychiral mixtures that
were used to generate these plots are shown for reference in Figure S9.

Figure 3 Histograms showing the (n, m)
abundance of two different polychiral solutions (a) and (b), shown
in Figure S9. The data is presented as
both spectral weight and relative concentration.

Constrained Fit of Entire Spectrum
A fit of the entire
spectrum can be performed by dividing the absorption spectrum into
different regions, as proposed by Nair et al.40 However, such piecewise fitting of complete spectra has the potential
to lead to nonphysical fits of the experimental data. For example,
when a larger (n, m) distribution
is required to fit S22 than is necessary for S11, or vice versa. In reality, these spectral regimes are physically
coupled and the (n, m) distribution
must, therefore, remain the same, independent of the region of consideration.
Ohmori et al. reported a ratio of 1.15 for S11/S22, whereas Miyata et al. reported a ratio of 1.2 for the integrated
molar absorption coefficients.42,74

These values
are overall estimates and a definite ratio could not be provided,
neither in terms of intensity nor area, due to the spectral overlap
and the assignment of one peak to multiple (n, m) species. Nair et al. reported that, for their fits, 30
out of 39 considered semiconducting SWCNTs had an S11/S22 peak intensity ratio larger than one, thus 9 of the included
SWCNTs had a larger peak intensity in S22 than they had
in S11.40 In an ideal system
without any doping effects, which might reduce S11 intensity,
the absorption cross section of the second optical transition is smaller
than that of the first one, which should always result in a smaller
peak intensity of the S22 absorption.73 Along with constraining the fit of the S22 region
to only include those (n, m) species
that were fitted in the S11 region, this assumption was
used in the present study to also constrain the height of the peak
in the S22 region to be a fraction of the S11 height, and the starting value for the fit was initially set to
4 (S11,height/S22,height = 4), and allowed to
vary between 1 and 5. All fractions (S11,height/S22,height pair for each (n, m) species)
were constrained to be within ±20% to guarantee for a comparable
distribution of peak intensities. In this way, an S22 peak
was prevented from becoming larger than its S11 counterpart.
Additionally, the FWHM of the S22 peak was restricted to
be smaller than the FWHM of the S11 counterpart to prevent
not only the intensity but also the area of the of the (n, m) species in S11, being smaller than
that in S22. An example of such a “constrained”
fitting procedure is provided in Figure 4a.

Figure 4 (a) Fit of entire spectral region that was background
corrected
according to Naumov et al.41 The measured
absorption spectrum is shown in black, and the calculated spectrum
is shown in green. (b) Close-up of fit of S22 region that
was constrained by the (n, m) species assigned to the S11 region with an intensity variation of S11/S22 between 1 and 5. It can be seen in
the region 500–620 nm that the experimental data has been poorly
replicated. (c) Upon inclusion of three metallic species, the fit
of the S22 region was significantly improved.

As well as preventing nonphysical fits to the data,
the great advantage
of fitting the entire spectrum of a polychiral sample under such constrained
conditions is that once all of the S22 peaks are removed,
what is left in that region is predominantly due to absorption by
metallic nanotubes, thereby providing some information about the metallic/semiconducting
purity. However, care must be taken to ensure that a poor fit in S22 is not a result of missing (n, m) species in the fit of S11 (as shown in detail
in Figure S10). Upon evaluating a close-up
of the S22 region in Figure 4a, shown in Figure 4b, it is apparent that the wavelength regime between
500 and 620 nm was not properly fitted. As demonstrated in Figure 4c, by adding four
additional metallic nanotubes to the absorption spectrum ((7,7), (8,5)
and (12,3)), the quality of the fit is improved (nSSE = 2.87
× 10–3 compared to 3.30 × 10–3). Table S2 summarizes the spectral weights
of (n, m) species determined from
the fits in Figure 4a,c. The spectral weight of the metallic tubes in solution was calculated
to be 0.37% (total area of metallic nanotubes divided by the sum of
the area of metallic and semiconducting S11 nanotubes).

Therefore, the semiconducting purity in S11, according
to spectral weight, of the solution is 99.63%, which is in good agreement
with previously reported values for gel-sorted nanotube solutions.75 However, due to a possible overlap of metallic
nanotubes and the S22 phonon sideband, the metallic peak
assignment is complicated. Likewise, the overlap of large diameter
M11 peaks with smaller diameter S22 peaks makes
assignment difficult and means that this method is best suited to
fit nanotubes with a narrow diameter distribution.

The results
of the solution fit can be used to fit film absorption
measurements based on the spectral concentration of each (n, m) species. A detailed discussion on
the film-fitting procedure and associated analysis of the effect of
different backgrounds and possible fields of application is given
in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
A comprehensive and up-to-date methodology for fitting carbon nanotube
absorption spectra was presented. The entire MATLAB code used in this
work is provided in the Supporting Information, as well as a straightforward LabVIEW-based graphical user interface
to improve accessibility for those less familiar with the MATLAB environment,
but who would still like to employ the functionality of the algorithms
in their work. The presented methodology provides the possibility
of using different backgrounds for different experimental conditions,
modeling of exciton–phonon sidebands, evaluation of the semiconducting
purity of the sample by inclusion of metallic species, determination
of concentration based on the spectral weight and absorption cross
section of species, and the fitting of solid film absorption spectra
based on the results of solution measurements. Although the processes
used in this work, and made available in the MATLAB code and associated
graphical user interface, are certainly an improvement over the use
of generic peak fitting software for the specialized task of fitting
carbon nanotube absorption spectra, the use of complementary techniques
such as PL and Raman spectroscopy is still required to obtain physically
significant data. In short, absorption spectroscopy alone should not
be seen as the kind of “turnkey” solution that other
techniques such as variance spectroscopy have the potential to be.
However, we expect that the work presented herein will prove to be
a useful resource and tool for those in the research community who
employ optical absorption spectroscopy in their carbon nanotube work
for a quantitative, yet reliable, analysis.

Methods
Preparation
of SWCNT Solutions
SWCNT dispersions were
prepared from aqueous surfactant wrapped dispersions using sodium
dodecylsulfate (SDS, Merck), sodium cholate (SC, ≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
and co-surfactant mixtures thereof. Detailed experimental details
can be found in previous publications.14,32 In brief,
small diameter HiPco (NanoIntegris) were suspended in 2 wt % SDS by
sonication for 1 h followed by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 64 206g (SW-40-TI rotor). The SDS concentration was then adjusted
to 1.6 wt % SDS, and the sample was added to 40 mL of Sephacryl-S200
gel (Amersham Biosciences). Following the separation at 1.6 wt % SDS,
the SDS concentration was gradually lowered in 0.2 wt % steps down
to a concentration of 0.8 wt %. The absorption spectra shown in Figures 1, 2, and 4 were taken from SWCNT solutions
with a starting concentration of 1 wt % SDS. The respective PL map
is shown in Figure S1.

UV and PL Measurements
Optical absorption measurements
of nanotube dispersions were performed on a Varian Cary 500 spectrophotometer.
For the PLE maps of the SWCNT dispersion, the spectrally separated
output of a WhiteLase SC400 supercontinuum laser source (Fianium Ltd.)
was used for excitation and spectra were recorded with an Acton SpectraPro
SP2358 (grating 150 lines/mm) spectrometer with an OMA-V InGaAs line
camera (Princeton Instruments) and corrected for background and wavelength-dependent
sensitivity/excitation power.
