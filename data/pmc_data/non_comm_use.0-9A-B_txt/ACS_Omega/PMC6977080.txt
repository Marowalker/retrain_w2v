In the present investigation, the silver present in photographic
waste is reclaimed catalytically using magnetically separable TiO2@CuFe2O4 nanocomposites (NCs), and further,
the recovered silver nanoparticles [Ag(0) NPs] are tested against
the representative bacteria for the antibacterial activity. Initially,
a series of the different composites between TiO2 nanoparticles
and CuFe2O4 nanoparticles are synthesized by
a sol–gel “ex situ” method to enhance the catalytic
activity of bare nanomaterials toward the visible region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of characteristic
patterns for the tetragonal structure in the bare materials or TiO2@CuFe2O4 NCs; however, the dominance
in the phase as well as intensity of the respective XRD reflections
in the NCs is observed according to the content of TiO2 or CuFe2O4 in the NCs. Field-emission electron
microscopic images show the uniform spherical particles for the representative
TiO2@CuFe2O4 NCs, which is also confirmed
through the HRTEM images. The magnetically separable behavior of the
representative TiO2@CuFe2O4 NCs is
confirmed through the VSM measurements, which also shows the superparamagnetic
properties due to the S-shaped nature of the hysteresis loop. Thereafter,
a photoconversion reaction of Ag(I) ions to Ag(0) NPs as a model reaction
is carried out using the different TiO2@CuFe2O4 NCs under visible light irradiation, and hence, the
higher catalytic recovery of Ag(0) NPs is observed for a composite
containing 10 wt % TiO2 and 90 wt % CuFe2O4 than that of other NCs or the bare one alone. The optimized
protocol of the model reaction is adopted for reclaiming Ag(0) NPs
from photographic waste. The progress of the catalytic reclamation
reaction is monitored using UV–visible, and then sizes of the
recovered Ag(0) NPs are confirmed through the HRTEM images. Thereafter,
the recovered Ag(0) NPs are tested for complete photoinactivation
of Escherichia coli bacteria within
120 min.

Introduction
Medical practices and the film industry have been extensively using
photographic or X-ray films for different purposes, which are developed
with photosensitive materials.1 During
the development of these films, silver-containing waste is generated
usually. This photographic waste is in the form of a typical black
and white solution containing silver ions with other ions such as
halides, sulfite, thiosulfate, acetates, etc., and it is discharged
into the environment. Due to such discharge into the environment,
the effluents containing silver may cause toxic exposure to aquatic
organisms. Also, literature studies revealed that excessive silver
in the food chain of humans has noticeable toxicity against the cell
lines of human beings, and hence it may cause kidney or liver damage,
skin or eye irritation, etc.2−5 Along with its toxicity to living organisms, silver
is a precious element used in ornaments, alloys, electrical contacts,
batteries, antibacterial agents, etc. Hence, silver discharge is one
of the issues in front of investigators or the government, which is
to be solved for gaining not only the good health of human beings
but also an economical status of a country. Therefore, ease of the
recovery of silver from photoprocessing waste is in dire need for
further research endeavors. Various methods have been established
to recover silver in photographic waste such as use of a metallic
replacement,6 ion exchange,7 electrolytic plating,8 and chemical
precipitation techniques.9 However, these
methods are suffering from the various constraints during the actual
silver recovery from waste. The chemical precipitation technique is
used commonly by the companies; however, the tedious protocols and
the availability of costly processing equipment are the hindrances
of such a method. Moreover, use of a metallic replacement is also
no longer effective due to the loss of the silver-based sludge after
refining. In electrolytic recovery, several factors such as the potential
of the fixer solution, agitation, current density, electrode material,
solution filtration, pH of the solution, etc. are optimized through
the number of attempts for silver recovery at low concentrations (<100
mg/L).10 In the case of ion-exchange methods,
silver is removed with alkaline solutions of KCN or Na2S2O7 as a complexing agent, but they use more
water as well as a tedious experimental setup for separating the mobile
phase and stationary phase to recover silver very efficiently using
a column. Besides, the cost and maintenance of the ion-exchange method
are also high compared to others. Therefore, these protocols have
certain pros and cons concerning each method for recovering silver
from waste. Hence, in the present context, the green, easy, and sustainable
nanocomposite (NC)-based protocol is reported for reclaiming the Ag(I)
ion present in photographic waste to nanocrystalline Ag(0).

For converting the silver ion to elemental silver, various reducing
agents such as NaBH4, citrate, borohydride, and ascorbate11−13 are used. In comparison to these reductants, the NCs are promising
in respective silver conversions, which are due to their higher surface
areas, better optoelectrical properties resulting in a strong oxidant/reductant
nature, enhancement in catalytic properties, and easy separation of
the catalysts from the reaction mixture. Therefore, the investigators
have used various NCs for this conversion as well. Wei et al. reported
the formation of Ag NPs from contaminated water containing Ag(I) ions
using Fe3O4@microbial extracellular polymeric
substance (EPS) NCs, but the overall synthetic route is not easier
due to the anchoring between the different components of the catalysts.14 Similarly, reduction of Ag(I) ions by amino
acid tyrosine at alkaline pH is reported, but this method requires
continuous monitoring of the reaction for temperature control.15 Ag(0) NPs are also formed in situ on the surface
of magnetic graphene oxide using polyethylenimine as a reducing as
well as stabilizing agent, and hence the obtained composites are used
for selective enrichment of glycopeptides. The overall selectivity
of this protocol is not up to the mark in comparison to the other
composites, which could be due to the multicomponent system affecting
the applications.16 Similarly, Luo et al.
recovered silver from wastewater using polymeric-based Fe3O4–SiO2–TiO2 composites;
however, the recovered Ag is strongly adsorbed on the catalysts used.17 Huang et al. used nanosorbents of poly[aniline(AN)-co-5-sulfo-2-anisidine(SA)] for the removal of Ag(I) ions
to Ag nanocrystals. This is possible due to the fact that the functional
groups of the polymer are directly used to recover and separate precious
Ag from wastewaters; however, the new Ag polymer nonabsorbent is formed,
and hence its further applicability is limited.18 From these various reports, bare Ag(0) NP recovery from
photographic waste is one of the very common challenging tasks with
the use of NCs due to various constraints. With the motivation of
Ag(0) NP recovery from waste as well as overcoming the various experimental
hindrances of earlier reported research endeavors, we have designed
the protocol for the recovery of Ag(0) NPs from photographic waste
using magnetically recoverable TiO2@CuFe2O4 (TCU) NCs, and hence the recovered colloidal Ag(0) NPs are
further utilized for antibacterial activity against the representative
bacteria.

In the present context, particularly, TCU NCs have been focused
on Ag(0) NP recovery from photographic waste under visible light irradiations.
This is because it is well known that TiO2 is the best
photocatalyst and also acts as an optically active material19 and CuFe2O4 is an inverse
spinel ferrite having better magnetization in the presence of a magnetic
field and also having an optical band gap toward the visible–NIR
region of the electromagnetic spectrum.20 The combination of these effective components leads to the enhancements
in the optical, electrical properties due to the proper charge trapping
between the densities of states for retarding the electron–hole
recombination rates,21 mixing of band levels
covering a wide optical coverage, formation of a heterostructure leading
to effective charge separation,22 formation
of charge carriers, and availability of more active sites for better
catalytic activity.23 In these connections,
fewer studies related to the potential applications of TiO2@CuFe2O4 have been found in the literature.
However, similar to our desired heterojunction composites, investigators
used the different composites of TiO2 with other ferrites.
Bechelany et al. reported photodegradation of methylene blue in visible
light irradiation by combination of a spinel ferrite with TiO2 for enhancing the efficiency of the photodegradation reaction.24 Wang et al. also synthesized TiO2–ZnFe2O4 in nanotube arrays for improving
the photoresponse properties, and then these NCs were efficiently
used in various applications such as water splitting, solar energy
utilization, and degradation of waste water.25 The enhancement in photoelectrochemical performance of CoFe2O4-sensitized TiO2 nanotubes was 30
times higher than that of bare TiO2 due to proper charge
separation of free radicals in the visible region.26 The hydrogen generation from methanol/water splitting was
reported using a NiFe2O4@TiO2 core@shell
structure, which has 10 times higher catalytic activity than that
of bare NiFe2O4 and TiO2.27 Based on these investigations, it is realized
that the composites of TiO2 with CuFe2O4 would result in the enhancement of the optoelectrical properties
of the NCs for efficient catalytic conversion of the Ag(0) NP recovery
from waste. Therefore, in the present investigations, different compositions
of TCU have been prepared, and thereafter these NCs are used for conversion
of Ag(I) ions using visible light irradiation. Then, the optimized
protocol is adopted for recovering Ag(0) NPs from photographic waste.28 Thereafter, the recovered Ag(0) NPs are tested
against Escherichia coli (E.
coli) bacteria.

Results and Discussion
The thermal change of an “as-prepared” hydroxo-copper
precursor is studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Figure 1 shows the thermogram
of CU from ambient to 1000 °C in an air atmosphere. The first
weight loss up to 0.9% at ∼178 °C is observed due to the
elimination of physically adsorbed water molecules from the compound.
The second drastic weight loss of 4.6% in the TGA curve from 178 to
400 °C is attributed to the removal of coordinated water as well
as organic residues. Moreover, the third change in mass loss from
400 to 500 °C is due to subsequent oxidative decomposition of
the precursor with the removal of organic moieties in crystalline
CU.29 Taking into account these observations,
the compound has been calcinated at 500 °C at room temperature.

precursor sample.

X-ray diffraction patterns of bare TiO2, CU, and the
representative TCU composites indicate the nanocrystalline nature
of all the materials, which are shown in Figure 2. The XRD pattern of TiO2 consists
of the characteristic reflections corresponding to the tetragonal
structure of TiO2. These characteristic diffraction peaks
at 25.36°, 37.94°, and 47.92° indexed to (101), (004),
and (200) planes, respectively, completely match with standard XRD
patterns (JCPDS no. 84-1285) of anatase TiO2.

Figure 2 X-ray diffraction patterns of (a) bare TiO2, (b) TCU2
NCs, (c) bare CU, and (d) TCU4 NCs.

In the case of CU, the XRD pattern displays reflections at 30.06°,
35.99°, and 41.70° corresponding to (200), (211), and (004)
planes, respectively, confirming the presence of the tetragonal spinel-type
structure of CU. This is in good agreement with the standard XRD pattern
(JCPDS no. 00-034-0425). In these patterns, other impurity peaks are
not observed.30,15 In the case of TCU NCs shown, the characteristic diffraction
peaks of tetragonal anatase TiO2 and spinel CU are observed.
Both bare and TCU-based NCs show a tetragonal crystal structure. In
the TCU NCs with a higher content of TiO2, the characteristic
reflections of TiO2 are dominant, while the reflections
of CU are more intense, which have a maximum percentage of CU. It
is also seen that decreasing of the peak intensity of NCs is observed
after the incorporation of TiO2 and CU compared to that
of bare TiO2 or bare CU materials.

The crystallographic parameters of the bare and NCs are shown in Table 1. The crystallite
size of TiO2 either in its bare or NC form is observed
in the range of 10 to 13 nm, while CU is in the range of 11 to 12
nm.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is useful for studying the
morphology as well as the particle size of samples. Figure 3 consists of TEM images of
bare CU and TCU4 NCs. Both of the materials show a spherical nature
with a compact arrangement of particles, and the particle size of
the samples is observed to be within 10 to 13 nm.

Figure 3 HRTEM images of (a) bare CU and (c) TCU4 NCs. Lattice fringes with
SEAD patterns of (b) bare CU and (d) TCU4 NCs.

High-resolution TEM images of bare CU and TCU NCs show the well-defined
crystal fringes, and the difference between the successive layers
matches well the d spacing value of the (211) reflections
of both samples. The selected-area electron diffraction (SEAD) of
bare CU exhibits a well-defined ring structure confirming the crystalline
nature of CU; however, in the TCU4 NCs, low-intensity diffuse rings
are observed (Figure 3b,d) due to their compositions with TiO2. It is concluded
that the well-defined crystalline nature of CU NPs is decreased in
the NCs. The lattice fringe widths of bare CU and TCU4 NCs are 2.50
and 2.51 Å, respectively, which matches the d spacing values of the respective reflections of the samples.

Figure 4a,c,e shows
the FESEM images of TiO2, bare CU, and representative TCU4
NCs, respectively, and those of TCU2 NCs are shown in the Supporting
Information, Figure S1. All these materials
show the uniform distribution of spherically shaped particles with
agglomeration between the neighboring particles. The grain size obtained
from FESEM for the samples is observed in the range of 11 to 12 nm,
which matches the crystallite size of XRD analysis. The elemental
dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) plot of the representative samples
is shown in Figure 4b,d,f. EDAX spectra of the respective TiO2, bare CU, and
TCU4 NCs show the characteristic peaks of Ti, Cu, Fe, and O only in
their patterns revealing the presence of these elements. Table 2 shows that the theoretical
and experimental percentages of Ti, Cu, Fe, and O present in TiO2, CU, and TCU4 are in good agreement with each other.

FTIR spectra of the representative samples are shown in Figure 5. All of the spectra
of TiO2, TCU4, TCU6 NCs, and bare CU (Figure S2) show the intense broad band for the M–O
bond stretching frequency in the range of 400–800 cm–1.31 Low- and high-intensity bands are
observed in the region of 400–700 cm–1 for
tetrahedral and octahedral complexes in the spinel ferrite structure.29 It is also observed that, in the NCs, the M–O
bond intensity increases as the concentration of TiO2 in
the NCs increases. The band at 3000–3500 cm–1 is assigned to the stretching −OH vibrations of water.

UV–visible absorption spectra of the representative TCU
NCs with bare materials are shown in Figure 6a,b. In the absorbance spectra of the composites
with a larger content of TiO2, the strong optical absorption
is observed in the range between 300 and 400 nm, while that with shifting
of the absorption edge toward a longer wavelength is observed with
the CU content in the bare TiO2. Moreover, the optical
absorption also covered from 300 to 800 nm and further increased in
absorption strength with the CU content in the composites compared
to that of others. The wide coverage of optical absorption in the
CU-dominant composites is due to its well-matchable visible–NIR-active
optical absorption of CU compared to that of UV-active TiO2 contents.32 Among the composites, a more
optical coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum and increase in the
intensity of the absorption bands are observed for the TCU4 NCs compared
to that of others, which would result in a strong optical absorption
of electromagnetic radiation for efficient catalytic activity in the
present reclamation reactions.

Figure 6 UV–visible DRS absorption spectra of (a) bare TiO2, TCU1 NCs, and TCU3 NCs, (c) bare CU, TCU4 NCs, and TCU6 NCs and
optical band gaps of (b) bare TiO2, TCU1 NCs, and TCU3
NCs and (d) bare CU, TCU4 NCs, and TCU6 NCs.

The optical band gap of the samples is calculated by using a modified
Tauc plot, which consists of (αhυ)1/2 versus photon energy (hυ). Tauc
plots for the representative samples are shown in Figure 6c,d. Extrapolation of the absorbance
edge to the x axis results in optical band gap values
of 1.4 and 3.2 eV for bare CU and bare TiO2 NPs, respectively,
which are in good agreement with those reported elsewhere.33 In addition, in the TiO2-dominant
composites (from TCU1 to TCU3), the optical band gap value is near
3.2 eV, while other composites have optical band gap values in the
range of 1.4–1.6 eV due to the mixing of HOMO–LUMO levels
of the components.34 The optical band gap
value of the samples is shown in the Supporting Information (Table S1). Based on these values, it is revealed
that TCU4 NCs have a well-matchable optical absorbance (and hence Eg = 1.6 eV) with the solar spectrum as compared
to the others.35 Therefore, the appropriate
compositions of TiO2 and CU in the TCU composites (particularly
TCU4) extends the more visible absorbance of the electromagnetic spectrum.
In addition, the electron charge separation between the components
also plays an important role in enhancing the catalytic activity of
the composites. Due to the major content of CU in the TCU4 sample,
after photoirradiation, the electrons from the valence band (VB) (−4.6
eV) of CU get excited to its CB (−3.4 eV), and then these electrons
would transfer to the CB (−4.2 eV) of TiO2 due to
their equivalent energy levels, while simultaneously, holes formed
in the VB can be scavenged by the other moieties present in the waste
in concordance with an earlier reported paper,36 and hence the electrons present in the CB encourage reduction
of Ag(I) present in waste to Ag. Therefore, the representative TCU4
composites retard the electron–hole recombination rate more
effectively, hence the better catalytic activity in the photochemical
reactions for recovering the silver present in the waste.

N2 adsorption/desorption measurements of the representative
TCU NCs are shown in Figure 7. The graph shows the existence of the characteristic type-IV
isotherm with a mesoporous nature of the materials. The specific surface
areas of TCU4 and TCU6 are found to be 50.46 and 34.18 m2/g–1, while the total pore volumes for these samples
are 0.055 and 0.042 cc/g, respectively. The specific surface area
and pore volume for the other composites are shown in the Supporting
Information, Table S1. Among them, TCU4
NCs exhibit a higher surface area than that of other composites or
bare materials. In the present investigation, the reported surface
area parameters of the TCU4 NCs are controversial to that of the usual
trends related to composite formations. This high specific surface
area induces higher exposure to active sites, and this leads to higher
catalytic activity for Ag(0) NP recovery from photographic effluent.
However, the pore volume value of the composites is decreased significantly
due to more interactions between the TiO2 and CU lattices
revealing the close lattice formation, and hence these closer lattices
would be preeminent in charge carrier separation in the photochemical
processes.37

Figure 7 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of (a) TCU4
and (b) TCU6 NCs.

A magnetic hysteresis curve of the representative TCU4 NCs at room
temperature is obtained by using VSM measurements with an applied
field of −15,000 to 15,000 Oe, which is shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Hysteresis loop of TCU4 NCs.

The plot has an S-shaped curve without a hysteresis loop with a
saturation magnetization (Ms) of 73.39
emu/g, hence confirming the superparamagnetic nature of TCU4 NCs.
The observed saturation magnetization (Ms) value greater than 45.00 emu/g indicates the magnetically well
separation properties of the desired catalyst, which facilitates the
easy recovery of the catalysts from suspensions at room temperature.38

Standard Protocol for Photocatalytic Conversion of Ag(I) Ions
to Ag(0) NPs
The photocatalytic conversion of Ag(I) ions
into Ag(0) NPs is conducted by using the TCU NCs. During this photochemical
conversions, the various reaction conditions such as the composition
of the catalyst, initial concentration of Ag(I) ions, amount of the
catalyst, and pH of the solution are optimized for efficient conversion
to get Ag(0) NPs from the reaction mixture, which are also highlighted
as follows.

Effect of Catalyst Composition
The photocatalytic reaction
is carried out using the different TCU NCs. During each attempt, the
reaction parameters such as the pH of the solution, amount of catalysts,
concentration of Ag(I) ions, wavelength and intensity of visible irradiation,
reaction time interval, etc. are kept constant except for the composition
of the catalysts. The progress of the photochemical conversions is
monitored through measuring the absorbance of the solution after 30
min using UV–visible measurements. Figure 9 shows the UV–visible absorbance spectra
of the supernatant solution containing the recovered silver for the
different NCs. The characteristic surface plasmon band at 417 nm of
Ag(0) NPs for all the compositions of TCU NCs as well as bare CU except
TiO2 NPs is seen. In bare TiO2, there is not
any absorption band of the Ag(0) NPs revealing the negligible visible
absorption made by the reaction mixture against its UV-active light
irradiation, and in the case of bare CU, the lower intensity of the
plasmon band reveals the recovery of Ag(0) NPs up to some extent due
to absorption of visible–NIR radiation against visible incident
photons. In connection to the NCs with a lower content of CU (from
TCU1 to TCU3), the intensity of the surface plasmon band is lower
revealing the little catalytic recovery of Ag(0) NPs, while the remaining
NCs having more intense bands reveal somewhat a faster catalytic conversion
rate for forming Ag(0) NPs. The lower rate of Ag(0) NP recovery for
TCU1 to TCU3 is in consistency with the mismatch between their optical
energy absorption and that of incident visible photons, while the
somewhat higher rate of Ag(0) recovery from TCU6 to TCU4 is attributed
to more absorption of visible–NIR radiation compared to that
of incident visible photons. Among all the NCs, the higher rate of
Ag(0) NP recovery is observed for TCU4 NCs due to the strong maximum
optical absorbance with a well-matchable optical band gap in the visible
region, greater specific surface area, and lower recombination rate
of charge carriers.39

Figure 9 Effect of catalyst composition in TCU NCs on the photoconversion
reaction of Ag(I) ions using various NCs after 120 min. {Experimental
conditions: (1) [AgNO3] = 60 ppm, (2) volume of AgNO3 = 100 mL, (3) amount of catalyst = 300 mg, (4) pH of the
solution = 9.00 ± 0.10, (5) wavelength 520 ± 40 nm, (6)
intensity = 8 W, and (7) time interval = 120 min.}

Taking into consideration higher catalytic Ag(0) NP recovery, all
further reclamation processes with variable reaction parameters are
carried out using TCU4 NCs only.

Effect of pH Variation
The effect of pH is also an
important parameter that could directly affect the aggregations the
particles formed in the solution and hence the particle size of Ag(0)
NPs formed. Figure 10 shows the absorbance of Ag(0) NPs formed with respect to the photon
wavelength for the reaction mixtures having different pH values using
TCU4 NCs under visible light irradiation. At pH = 9.00 ± 0.10,
the strong surface plasmon band is appeared at 417 nm for smaller
Ag(0) NPs due to the minimal effect of particle aggregations. This
is attributed to the good capping of the particles formed in the nucleation
stage by the surfactant as well as the availability of more functional
moieties on the catalysts to interact with Ag(I) more strongly resulting
in the uniform particles. However, in acidic conditions of the reaction
mixture (pH = 3 ± 0.10), the absorbance of the analyte solution
is observed at 803 nm of the larger Ag(0) NPs formed. Therefore, with
a decrease in the pH of the reaction mixture, the absorbance band
is shifted from 417 to 803 nm. Therefore, the aggregations of the
particles, good capping of NPs by surfactants, availability of active
sites on the catalysts for strong interactions, and hence size of
the Ag(0) NPs formed are strongly dependent with the pH of the reaction
mixture. These results are also in good consistency with the research
endeavors related to behaviors of Ag NPs in wastewater.40 With this present investigation, the catalytic
recovery of Ag(0) NPs from the waste is conducted at pH = 9.00 of
the solution.

Figure 10 Effect of the pH of Ag(I) ion on the photoconversion reaction of
Ag(I) into Ag(0) NPs in the presence of TCU4 NCs under visible irradiation.
{Experimental conditions: (1) [AgNO3] = 60 ppm, (2) volume
of AgNO3 = 100 mL, (3) amount of the catalyst = 300 mg,
(4) catalyst = TCU4, (5) wavelength = 520 ± 40 nm, (6) intensity
= 8 W, and (7) time interval = 120 min.}

Effect of the Initial Concentration of the Ag(I) Solution
Figure 11 shows
the absorbance of Ag(0) NPs formed with respect to the photon wavelength
for the reaction mixtures having different concentrations of Ag(I)
ions (from 20 to 80 ppm) using TCU4 NCs under visible light irradiation.
From the figure, it is seen that, as the concentration of Ag(I) ions
increases from 20 to 60 ppm, the surface plasmon band absorbance at
417 nm of Ag(0) NPs formed increases, while thereafter it decreases
beyond a 60 ppm concentration of Ag(I) ions. For a higher concentration
of Ag(I) ions, a greater number of highly energetic particles having
smaller diameters would be formed in the nucleation stage, and then
these energetic particles undergo Ostwald ripening at a very high
rate resulting in somewhat bigger particles in the reaction mixture.
Therefore, at 80 ppm concentrations of Ag(I) ions, the overall number
of Ag(0) NPs is less, which is reflected through the decrease in the
intensity of the characteristic surface plasmon band of the Ag(0)
NPs.41 Based on this investigation, a greater
number of Ag(0) NPs are formed at 60 ppm concentrations of Ag(I) ions,
and hence this concentration of Ag(I) ions is fixed during the catalytic
recovery of Ag(0) NPs from photographic waste.

Figure 11 Effect of the initial concentration of Ag(I) ions on the photoconversion
reaction of Ag(I) into Ag(0) NPs in the presence of TCU4 NCs under
visible irradiation. {Experimental conditions: (1) pH of AgNO3 = 9.00 ± 0.10, (2) volume of AgNO3 = 100
mL, (3) amount of catalyst = 300 mg, (4) catalyst = TCU4, (5) wavelength
520 ± 40 nm, (6) intensity = 8 W, and (7) time interval = 120
min.}

Effect of the Amount of the Catalyst
To analyze the
effect of the amount of the catalyst on the photoconversion reaction
of Ag(I) ions into the Ag(0) NPs, the amount of the TCU4 catalyst
is varied from 100 to 500 mg keeping other experimental conditions
constant. Figure 12 shows the absorbance of Ag(0) NPs formed with respect to the photon
wavelength for the reaction mixtures containing different amounts
of the TCU4 catalyst. It is seen that, as the amount of the catalyst
increases from 100 to 300 mg, the absorbance strength of the characteristic
absorbance maxima also increases. However, beyond 300 mg, the excess
addition of the catalyst decreases the absorbance strength of recovered
Ag(0) NPs. These observations of decreasing absorbance intensity of
the characteristic band are also reflected through an increase in
turbidity of the reaction mixture during photochemical conversions.42 This increase in the turbidity of the solution
for higher amounts of TCU4 (600 mg) retards the intensity of incident
photons reaching the interactions of Ag(I) ions with the catalysts,
and hence a lower number of Ag(0) NPs are formed as derived from the
intensity of the plasmon band.

Figure 12 Effect of the catalyst amount on the photoconversion reaction of
Ag(I) into Ag(0) NPs in the presence of TCU4 NCs under visible irradiation.
{Experimental conditions: (1) pH of AgNO3 = 9.00 ±
0.10, (2) volume of AgNO3 = 100 mL, (3) [AgNO3] = 60 ppm,
(4) catalyst = TCU4, (5) wavelength 520 ± 40 nm, (6) intensity
= 8 W, and (7) time interval = 120 min.}

All these optimized experimental parameters of the photoconversion
reaction of the Ag(I) ion into the Ag(0) NPs are applied for the recovery
of Ag(0) NPs from the photographic waste.

Application to Photographic Effluent Solutions
After
proper sampling of photoprocessing waste, it is treated to recover
Ag(0) NPs using the optimized parameters of a model reaction with
TCU4 NCs in visible light irradiation, and the progress of the reaction
is monitored through UV–visible measurements. Figure 13 shows the UV–visible
pattern of the Ag(0) NPs recovered from photographic waste at pH =
9.00. The surface palsmon band at 421 nm is observed revealing the
formation of Ag(0) NPs from the photoprocessing waste. The similar
treatment is also applied to photoprocessing waste at pH = 3.00 by
keeping the optimized parameters constant, and hence the formation
of larger Ag(0) NPs is confirmed through the UV–visible band
(inset of UV–visible spectrum, Figure 13) shifted at 802 nm.40 In addition, the concentration of Ag(0) NPs recovered from
photoprocessing waste is determined by using the following equation:43

Figure 13 Photoconversion reaction of photographic waste to Ag(0) NPs using
TCU4 NCs. {Experimental conditions: (1) amount = 300 mg, (2) volume
of photographic waste = 100 mL, (3) [photographic waste] = 60 ppm,
(4) catalyst = TCU4, (5) wavelength = 520 ± 40 nm, (6) intensity
= 8 W, and (7) time interval = 120 min.}

C = NT/NVNAwhere C is the molar concentration of
the nanoparticle solution, NT is the total
number of silver atoms added, N is the Ag(0) NPs’
number of atoms per NP, V is the Ag(0) NPs’
volume of the reaction solution in liters, and NA is the Avogadro’s number of Ag(0) NPs (6.023 ×
1023). In the present investigation, the catalytic conversion
efficiencies of 89.50% and 98.00% are obtained for Ag(0) NPs recovered
from photoprocessing waste at pH 3 and 9, respectively.

The formation of smaller or larger Ag(0) NPs at the different pH
values is also confirmed through HRTEM images, and these images are
shown in Figure 14a,b. The Ag(0) NPs recovered at the different pH values are spherical
in shape. The average diameter of Ag(0) NPs recovered at pH = 9.00
is observed to be approximately 15 nm, while the average diameter
of Ag(0) NPs recovered at pH = 3.00 is approximately 72 nm. These
observations are also in good agreement with the results observed
in the optimized model reaction at the different pH values. Therefore,
smaller Ag(0) NPs are formed for the acidic pH compared to those of
the basic pH of the reaction mixture under the optimized experimental
conditions, and hence these smaller particles having higher surface
areas would have better catalytic activity in the antibacterial studies.
HRTEM images also show that the lattice crystal fringe value of 0.232
nm corresponds to a characteristic (111) plane of Ag(0) NPs formed.

Figure 14 HRTEM images of recovered nanocrystalline silver formation for
(a) pH = 9 and (c) pH = 3 and lattice fringes of (b) pH = 9 and (d)
pH = 3.

The spherically shaped Ag(0) NPs show higher antibacterial activity
against bacteria due to higher surface areas for better contact with
microorganisms, so the spherically shaped Ag(0) NPs were used for
photoinactivation of bacteria in a test against E. coli bacteria.44

Antimicrobial Activity of Recovered Ag(0) NPs
Due to
the smaller Ag(0) NPs recovered from waste at pH = 9.00, these NPs
are further used to test antibacterial activity against E.
coli bacteria. In this study, the antibacterial activity
of Ag(0) NPs against E. coli is
carried using the varying concentrations of Ag(0) NPs recovered from
25 μL up to 100 μL, and hence complete killing of E. coli bacteria is observed in 120 min
using Ag(0) NPs. The antibacterial results obtained using an agar
disc diffusion method are shown in Figure 15.

Figure 15 Antibacterial activity of recovered Ag(0) NPs by the agar disc
diffusion method.

Agar Disc Diffusion Method
Figure 15 shows the zone of inhibition (ZOI) of E. coli control using recovered Ag(0) NPs. It is seen that
the diameter of ZOI is increased with an increase in the concentration
of Ag(0) NPs up to 100 μL. The highest diameter (3.2 cm) of
the ZOI for E. coli control is observed for 100 μL
concentrations of Ag(0) NPs, while 2.3 cm and 1.4 cm diameters are
observed for 50 and 25 μL concentrations of Ag(0) NPs, respectively.
Therefore, the recovered Ag(0) NPs are good antibacterial agents against E. coli, and hence these results are in good agreement with
others.45,46

Conclusions
The easy and sustainable protocol has been successful used to recover
Ag(0) NPs from photographic waste using magnetically separable TiO2@CuFe2O4 NCs, and thereafter the recovered
NPs are tested against the E. coli bacteria for antibacterial
studies. The different compositions of TiO2@CuFe2O4 NCs are synthesized using the wet-chemical ex situ
method at 110 °C. The prominent tetragonal-phase dominance of
the respective components is confirmed through XRD measurements. A
wide visible optical coverage for the NCs is observed compared to
that of UV-active TiO2 NPs or visible–NIR CU NPs.
Magnetic VCM measurements reveal the superparamagnetic nature of TCU4
NCs with a saturation magnetization (Ms) value of 73.39 emu/g, which confirms the magnetically separable
nature of TCU4 NCs. The standard protocol for conversion of Ag(I)
ions to Ag(0) NPs is established with the various optimized parameters
under visible photoirradiation. Then, the optimized protocol is adopted
for the recovery of Ag(0) NPs from photographic waste solutions, and
hence, further, these recovered Ag(0) NPs from photographic waste
are used as efficient antibacterial agents against E. coli.

Experimental Section
Materials
All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
and these are used directly without purification for recovery of colloidal
Ag(0) NPs.

Synthesis of Bare Materials and Their Nanocomposites
Synthesis of Nanocrystalline CuFe2O4 (CU)
Nanocrystalline CU is prepared by using a sol–gel autocombustion
method. First, the stoichiometric amount of metal nitrates is dissolved
in a minimum quantity of deionized water and mixed together. This
resulting solution is subjected to the addition of citric acid as
fuel for the combustion process as well as CTAB as a capping agent
under constant stirring. The pH of the resulting solution is adjusted
to 9.00 ± 0.10 using ammonia. During the addition of ammonia,
the color of the solution is varied from green to black. Then, the
mixture is heated to 250 °C until combustion occurs. After combustion,
the powder is cooled at room temperature and sintered at 500 °C
for 6 h.

Synthesis of TiO2 NPs
TiO2 NPs
are prepared by a sol–gel route. Synthesis of TiO2 is carried out by an earlier reported paper to get anatase-phase
TiO2.47

Synthesis of TiO2@CuFe2O4 (TCU)
NCs
The synthesis of TCU NCs is carried out by an ex situ
method. As per respective compositions, the desired weight percent
of TiO2 as well as CU is dispersed in 10 mL ethanol in
a beaker, and then the overall content is stirred for 4 h. Subsequently,
the solution is ultrasonicated for 60 min to ensure proper dispersion.
After that, the precipitate is separated and dried in an electric
oven at 110 °C. In a similar way, the different compositions
such as TCU1 (TiO2 = 99.0%, CU = 1.0%), TCU2 (TiO2 = 95.0%, CU = 5.0%), TCU3 (TiO2 = 90.0%, CU = 10.0%),
TCU4 (TiO2 = 10.0%, CU = 90.0%), TCU5 (TiO2 =
5.0%, CU = 95.0%), and TCU6 (TiO2 = 1.0%, CU = 99.0%) NCs
are synthesized with the respective amount of TiO2 as well
as CU.

Catalytic Reclamation of Silver from Photographic Waste
The catalytic reclamation of silver present in the photographic waste
is carried out using the different steps, namely, development of a
standard protocol, optimization of the various preparative parameters
such as the pH of the solution, composition of the catalysts, amount
of the catalysts, etc., and thereafter the optimized standard protocol
is used for treating the photochemical waste to recover silver in
the nanoscale dimensions.

Designing of the Standard Protocol for Forming Nanocrystalline
Silver from Ag(I) Ions
In the standard protocol, the Ag(I)
ions are reduced to colloidal Ag(0) NPs using NCs under visible light
irradiation (wavelength of 520 ± 40 nm with an intensity of 8
W) at room temperature. During this conversion, the various reaction
conditions such as the composition of the catalyst, initial concentration
of AgNO3, amount of the catalyst, and pH of the reaction
mixture are optimized for efficient conversion. An amount of desired
TCU NCs as the photocatalyst is dispersed in varying concentrations
of AgNO3 (20 ppm, 100 mL) and sodium lauryl sulfate aqueous
solution (0.30 g). After a fixed irradiation time interval (30 min),
2.0 mL aliquots are collected, and then the catalyst from an aliquot
is separated magnetically. Then, the absorbance of the supernatant
solution is measured with the help of a UV–visible spectrophotometer.

Treatment of Photographic Waste for Reclaiming Ag(0) NPs
Initially, the photographic waste is aerated to oxidize the moieties
present in it as well as to remove the dissolved gases. Then, it is
treated with sodium thiosulfate solution, and thereafter it is centrifuged
to remove the suspended or solid particles. Then, the supernatant
solution is further treated with NCs as per optimized condition used
in the standard protocol. The progress of catalytic reclamation is
monitored by UV–visible spectrophotometer measurements. Also,
the morphology with the size of recovered silver particles is confirmed
through HRTEM with SAED patterns.

Antibacterial Activity of Recovered Ag(0) NPs
The recovered
nanocrystalline silver is further used against the photocatalytic
antibacterial studies. The antimicrobial activity of recovered Ag(0)
NPs has been studied against gram-negative E. coli. All labware are sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 30
min. The testing microorganism E. coli is cultured
on nutrient agar plates at 37 °C for 24 h, and the inhibitory
effects of Ag(0) NPs on microorganisms are tested by using the agar
disc diffusion method.

Agar Disc Diffusion Method
A bacterial suspension is
prepared in a 10 mL saline solution to obtain a final concentration
up to 108 CFU mL–1. This bacterial suspension
is spread on previously prepared agar petriplates.48 Sterilized Whatmann paper was cut in disc shapes with a
5 mm diameter and soaked into the colloidal Ag(0) NP solution with
different volumes (25, 50, and 100 μL). Due to this, adsorption
of Ag(0) NPs on the disc takes place, and the appropriate results
could be obtained. Microbial strains are then allowed to grow for
24 h at 37 °C.49 The inhibitory effect
on microorganisms is evaluated by calculating the diameter of the
zone of inhibition (ZOI) surrounding the paper disc.

Measurements
Thermal stability of the ferrite sample was measured by a thermogravimetric
instrument (SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
of the samples was done in the 2θ range from 10–80°
on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation.
The surface morphology of nanomaterials was studied using field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (FEI, Nova NanoSEM 450), and
elemental analysis was obtained on a scanning electron microscope
with an energy-dispersive atomic X-ray (EDAX) spectrometer(JEOL JSM
6360 LV). The particle size of the representative NCs was confirmed
using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (FEI, Tecnai
F20). Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra of the samples were recorded
using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (LabIndia, UV 3092). The vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis of NCs is recorded on Lakeshore
VSM 7410 to get the hysteresis loop. The detailed characterization
of TiO2 is reported in our earlier paper.47
