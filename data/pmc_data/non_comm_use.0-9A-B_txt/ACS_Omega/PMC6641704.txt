This report deligates about the creation
of porous polymeric organic
framework (POF) from dialkynes and poly(alkyne) with their discovery
as an efficient set of purifier. POF showed efficient physisorption
for dyes—fluorescein and rhodamine B. The material POF selectively
released rhodamine B and not fluorescein. The material was recyclable
over number of cycles during the adsorption–release cycle.
Moreover, the thiol-functionalized POF expectedly showed chemisorption
for mercury. Therefore, the prime attractive cause for such a material
is its ability to recycle as well as its thiol functionalization toward
the removal of heavy metal such as mercury.

Introduction
Industrialization has
shown remarkable impact on human society.
Although there are number of positive impact, the adverse effects
such as deadly impact of dyes and heavy metals on society cannot be
ignored. Amphiphilic organic dyes are the prime water toxicants that
industries
eliminate. The major contributor of such toxicants is the textile
industry. Their accumulation in the body organs provides strong root
to diseases that may or may not be curable. Nausea, hypertension,
cardiac lock, and so on are some of the usual symptoms that may rise
due to such toxicants. Other than dyes, heavy metals are another subclass
of toxicants. Their release from the industrial sector to drinking
water bodies needs to be checked. They are fatal to the body organs.
Heavy metals can interfere with enzymes, leading to the cessation
of the synthesis of energy sources such as adenosine 5′-triphosphate
and NADH within the body. The scarcity of energy causes inhibition
of metabolism within the body. To avoid such circumstances, preventive
measures are essential. The priority should be given to the growth
of noble materials that can squeeze out toxicants with no harm to
marine lives. For this to happen, nontoxicity and biodegradability
are the prime factors that need to be taken into consideration while
implementing the application of these materials. Again, the architectural
design of the defined pore size can be crucial for specific toxicants.
Moreover, controlled rigidity and insolubility along with stability
in the aqueous phase are the desired properties for their development.
Such a material can be very influential toward the removal of organic
and amphiphilic dyes via physisorption. Chemisorption can be initiated
with the thiol-based surface functionalization. A number of approaches
have been implemented and new techniques are introduced from time
to time to prevent the disposal of toxicants to water bodies via sorption.
Thiol–alkyne click reaction can initiate
such a functionalization within the material. The click chemistry
based porous polymeric organic framework (POF) so synthesized can
prove to be a vital tool for adsorption of such toxicants.1−12 Covalent organic framework, so-called COF, is a two-dimensional
framework that has been explored significantly since last two decades.13,14 However, the POF is yet to be explored. Like COF, the covalently
bonded three-dimensional (3D) polymeric frameworks derived can prove
to be very crucial for adsorption and catalysis. Rigidity, compressibility,
swellability,
and stability are the prime characteristics exhibited by a polymeric
network. Easy handling is the other crucial factor. Very few reports
are highlighted for the application of POF in adsorption. Moreover,
porous polymeric framework has raised its impact in the recent time
for their application. Here, we report the utility of a 3D POF for
the adsorption of toxicant with and without functionalization.

Results
and Discussion
With the objective set to sense, trap, and
remove toxicants, we
are looking forward to grow POFs for the efficient removal of dye
molecules, for example, fluorescein (D1) and rhodamine B (D2) along
with the heavy metal mercury, via sorption process.15−25 The growth of POF was assigned via thiol–alkyne click chemistry.
The chain length for dialkynes was tuned to check the efficiency as
a trapper for toxicants. Poly(alkyne)26 was clicked to compare the efficiency with a pored network derived
from dialkynes. On observation, the crosslinking via radical mechanism
for poly(alkyne) was well-controlled as compared with dialkynes. The
synthetic schemes for the pored networks 1A and 2B are shown in Scheme S1, Supporting
Information (SI), whereas those for 3C is shown in Scheme 1. Scheme 2 represents the proposed mechanism
for the synthesis of crosslinked polymers. The proposed free radical
mechanism is the representative for thiol−alkyne C−S
bond formation at single repeating unit only. The same mechanism takes
place to other units of the polymers present within the system simultaneously.
The condensed polymer 3 so synthesized for the growth
of POF 3C was reprecipitated in cold methanol followed
by dialysis in the dialysis tube of Mw = 3.5k and in solvent chloroform. The respective conversion rate
for 1A, 2B, and 3C was approximately
0.4, 0.5, and 2.0 h, respectively. The reactions were time controlled.
The synthesized dialkynes (A′ and B′) and poly(alkyne), C′ were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figures S1–S3, SI). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) analysis for white amorphous poly(alkyne) C′ was performed too. The MALDI-TOF spectrum for C′ is represented in Figure S5, SI. Partial
reduction of the unsaturated clicked compound 3C was
confirmed from the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum. The carbon
signal present within the range 120–140 ppm corresponds to
an alkene carbon, indicating the partial reduction of alkyne moieties
(Figure S4, SI). Because the conversion
was time controlled, we set the reaction time at 0.4 h under the photochamber
and irradiated at wavelength of 365 nm to analyze the extent of polymerization.
According to micro-Raman spectroscopic observation, the intensity
of the C–S band varied. The spectra revealed the strongest
signal for 1A followed by 2B and 3C (Figure 1). This
reflects the crosslink polymerization via the C–S covalent
bond formation, which was time controlled and the crosslink was highest
for 1A and lowest for 3B. This shows that
the thiol functionalization on 3C POF surface is possible
with a greater density than on 1A and 2B. This would make poly(alkyne) more efficient as a multitasking agent.

Further, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for 1A, 2B, C′, and 3C were
performed as shown in Figure S6, SI. The
TGA curves confirmed the stability of compounds 1A, 2B, and 3C up to 300 °C. Further, to check
their stability in water, the compounds were introduced to a buffer
solution at pHs 5 and 9. The pictorial representation in Figure S7, SI, reveals their stability as the
materials remained intact for over 1 week. The hydrophobic nature
of 1A, 2B, and 3C inhibits
the polar components to penetrate at different pH. This makes the
system more stable and durable.

Presence of free thiol (−SH)
was confirmed from the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The FTIR curve reflected weak
and sharp signals for the S–H stretching at 2550 cm–1, as shown in Figure 6c. Both solid-state 13C NMR and FTIR analyses confirmed
the presence of free thiols in a partially reduced POF. The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-SEM for 1A, 2B, and 3C were done to confirm the pore formation.
Recyclization of the materials in terms of adsorption–release
analysis was performed using UV–vis spectroscopy. The efficiency
of the materials over the cycles was examined too. Raman spectroscopy
was done to confirm the chemisorbed heavy metal ion mercury, Hg2+, on the thiol (−SH) functionalized surface. Metal–sulfur
and carbon–sulfur (C–S) bonds
were analyzed using micro-Raman spectroscopy.

The photoirradiated
thiol–alkyne clicked reaction mixture
showed a transition from liquid to solid. The state conversion so
confirmed from the pictorial representation of the expected POFs in Figure 2a was examined through
SEM and cryo-SEM techniques. The snapshots from the SEM and cryo-SEM
of dried solid materials, 1A, 2B, and 3C in Figures 2b–d and S8a–d, SI, confirm
the formation of pores. As expected, the pores in 1A were
small, enclosed due to compactness. Although 2B showed
compact nature, the pores were comparatively larger
than those in 1A. This indicates that switching carbon
chain from C6 to C10 within the hydrocarbon
backbone could control the formation of pores while preserving the
compactness. The fact that the morphology of
POF derived from poly(alkyne) was completely different from that observed
for POF derived from dialkyne implies that the alignment of thiol
against alkyne influences the nature of the surface. The surface is
different in the
aspect that 3B has a greater percentage of roughness
than 1A and 2B. This enhanced roughness
in addition to the pores in 3C could be expected to show
a greater role in adsorption. With pores confirmed, the POFs 1A, 2B, and 3C were made to swell
in solvents of different polarity such as CHCl3 and dimethyl
sulfoxide. Their swelling ratios were calculated in weight percent
via eq S1, SI. The swelling ratios are
tabulated in Table S1, SI. On observation,
the swelled percentage for 3C was comparable to that
for 2B but much greater than that observed for 1A. 1A and 2B break during swelling–deswelling
process, whereas 3C retains its identity. Figure S9a clearly supports our observation.
This was due to the rigidity and highly compact nature of 1A, and 2B. Rheometric analysis was possible for 3C, with the reaction being quenched before completion. As
observed from Figure S9b, the partially
clicked 3C could bear the oscillatory stress close to
150 with G′ > G″.27,28

spectra—(i) and (ii) represent respective adsorption curves
for D1 and D2 by POFs 1A, 2B, and 3C. Concentration for dyes D1 and D2 was 0.01 mM.

For the constant weight of material (60 mg) as
well as for the
constant concentration of dyes D1 and D2 (0.01 mM), the adsorption
analysis for dyes D1 and D2 was performed using POFs. The pictorial
representation in Figure 2e–h reflects the adsorption of both dyes per day. The
adsorption of D1 was 100% by all POFs as shown in Figure 2i. Figure 2j shows that the adsorption for D2 was 100%
in 3C among all of the POFs. The decrease in trends observed
for the adsorption of D2 as revealed by the UV curve was in the order 3C > 2B > 1A. The same trend
was
observed for the concentration 0.1 mM against 90 mg POF/mL. The pictorial
representation is shown in Figure S11,
SI. The observations were noted after 24 h. Further, the materials 1A, 2B, and 3C were examined to
check their optimum limit for the adsorption of dyes D1 and D2. The
amount required for the adsorption of D1 at concentration 0.01 mM/mL
solution was 60 mg of 1A, 50 mg of 2B, and
40 mg of 3C (Figure 3a). For the adsorption of D2, the amount needed was
80 mg of 1A, 50 mg of 2B, and 30 mg of 3C (Figure 3b). The kinetics of the adsorption of the dyes was performed too.
The kinetic studies for the adsorption of the dyes were done with
UV spectroscopic techniques (Figures 4 and5). The amount of materials
for adsorption kinetic analysis was fixed at 60 mg/mL. The concentration
of the dye solutions was 0.01 mM. Figure 4a–c represents the UV spectra where
the intensity of dye D1 decreases with time. The comparative curve
in Figure 4d reveals
that the rate of adsorption by clicked crosslinked polymer materials
was in the order (2B and 3C) > 1A. 2B and 3C adsorbed fluorescein
within
6 h, whereas 1A took 18 h for complete adsorption. Similarly,
the adsorption kinetics for dye D2 showed that the adsorption increased
with time. The adsorption rate was highest for 3C and
lowest for 1A (Figure 5a–c). The comparative plot in Figure 5d reveals that the adsorption
for 3C completed within 12 h. The complete adsorption
for 2B took 36 h, but 48 h was not sufficient for 1A.

mL.

of dye D2 was 0.01 mM.

Later, the material was tested for its recyclability and
reusability.
The release of the adsorbed dyes D1 and D2 was undertaken in solvent
methanol. The release was insignificant for D1. For D2, the trend
for release was similar to that observed for adsorption. Further,
the recyclization of POFs was done for a number of cycles. The efficiency
of the release by an individual POF was examined. Their relative efficiency
over the cycles was compared too. Equations S2 and S3, SI, were used to calculate the respective adsorption
and release by POFs. Figure 6a,b reveals the fact that the poly(alkyne)-derived
POF, 3C, showed dominance in adsorption–release
compared with 1A and 2B. This confirmed
the fact that the greater roughness on 3C stimulates
greater adsorption than in smooth pored POFs 1A and 2B.29−31

and release over cycles. (c) FTIR spectrum for the presence of free

the color and texture of thiol-functionalized POF in the presence

mercury, Hg(II). The concentration of the aqueous solution was 0.01
mM. The amount of 1A, 2B, and 3C taken was 60 mg/mL.

Moreover, with the flexibility of the polymer network film
taken
into account, the thiol (−SH) functionalization was performed
via change in equivalence of C′ (1 equiv) and D (1.2 equiv). The reaction was quenched after 2 h with methanol
and exposure to atmospheric air. The material so prepared was left
to swell and washed with chloroform. The pictorial data for the film
with unsaturated and free thiol is shown in Figure 7a. The film with unsaturation was nonsticky
and dry, whereas that with free thiol was sticky. Also, the sticky
nature increased with an increase in the equivalence of D. Figure 6c confirms
the presence of POF embedded with thiols (−SH). The thiol-embedded
POF (3C′) was dipped in water contaminated with
mercury (Hg2+) at the concentration 0.01 mM. We observed
the characteristic
texture change for POFs when allowed to stand for overnight as shown
in Figure 6d. The texture
for the functionalized POF in a mercury-free and mercury-contaminated
aqueous phase changed to white opaque from a transparent one. When
dried, the same opaque texture was retained in 3C′ when dipped in mercury-contaminated water. The transparency was
regained for 3C′ when dipped in mercury-free water.
The retained and changed textures are represented pictorially in Figure 3d. The morphology
for the trapped soft acids (Hg2+) onto the surface was
examined from SEM as well as a microscope. On observation, the morphology
of the POF was changed as shown in Figures 6e and S10, SI.
Raman spectroscopy was performed to confirm C–S and Hg–S
bond formation. Figure 7b supports the finding. The respective Raman shifts were observed
at 321 and 678 cm–1. The mechanism of trapping was
based on the hard and soft acids and bases principle proposed by Prof.
Pearson. The salts, [Hg2+,2Cl–], a combination
of soft acid–hard base, were dissolved in water. As expected,
in the presence of thiol, we assumed from the evidence, there was
an exchange of (hard, soft) and (soft, hard) ion pairs to (soft, soft)
and (hard, hard) ion pairs, which was entropically driven.32−34

Conclusions
We
have developed a class of neutral and thiol-functionalized POFs.
The photoclicked system was not only effective but also cost efficient.
The POF derived from alkyne polymer showed maximum efficiency for
the removal of phenolphthalein-derived amphiphilic dye molecules.
The thiol-functionalized POF system responded positively when tested
for mercury. The toxicants were removed efficiently via sorption.
With these, POF network has the potential to dominate the industrial
sector with its application as the remover and purifier of the waste
and harmful chemicals generated. The work in our group is in progress
toward growth of material with improved efficiency, compressibility,
and solvent selectivity from organic to aqueous and vice versa in
terms of swellability.
