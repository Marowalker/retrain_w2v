intermolecular interactions, polymer semiconductors
aggregate in solution even at elevated temperature. With the aim to
study the effect of this kind preaggregation on the order of thin
films and further transistor performance, bi-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione and fluorinated oligothiophene copolymerized polymer

through a temperature-controlled dip-coating technique. X-ray diffraction
and atomic force microscopy results reveal that the aggregation behavior
of P1 in solution affects the microstructures and order
of P1 films. The charge transport properties of P1 films are investigated with bottom-gate top-contacted thin-film
transistors. The variation of device performance (from 0.014

The correlation between preaggregation degree and transistor performance
of P1 films is explored.

Introduction
Polymer transistors
have attracted great attention because they
can be fabricated in large scale on flexible substrates at low cost.1−6 Besides the intrinsic charge carrier property, the order of polymer
semiconductor in films determines the performance of polymer transistors.7−10 Although great efforts have been made, many defects still exist
in the as-spun films, and the films usually display poor transistor
performance. Post-treatments, such as thermal annealing11−13 and solvent annealing,14−17 are required to improve the order and lower the defects
of films so as to facilitate the charge carrier transport. However,
thermal annealing process is usually conducted at relatively high
temperature (>150 °C, sometimes >200 °C),18,19 and solvent annealing is subject to a variety of solvents.16,17 Hence, it is highly required to optimize the order of polymer semiconductors
during the film deposition process.

Due to their strong intermolecular
interactions, polymer semiconductors
usually aggregate in solution (even at elevated temperatures).20−23 It is believed that this kind of preaggregation is helpful to form
ordered thin films.24,25 Unfortunately, the effects of
preaggregation degree on the order of films and the performance of
devices are rarely reported due to the difficulty in controlling the
self-assembly of polymer semiconductors. It is well known that the
self-assembly of polymer semiconductors is influenced by temperature
in solution; therefore, we believe the preaggregation degree of polymers
can be controlled through regulating the solution temperature. To
achieve this goal, the polymer used should have strong temperature-dependent
preaggregation at relatively low temperature.

Donor–acceptor
(D–A)-type polymer semiconductors
have attracted great attention due to their potential applications
in organic transistors and organic solar cells.26−30 Currently, most of the reported D–A polymer
semiconductors are diketopyrrolopyrrole-,31,32 naphthalenediimde-,33,34 and isoindigo35,36-based ones. The development of polymer semiconductors with new acceptor
building blocks is not only crucial to the exploration of high-performance
polymer semiconductors, but also important to summarize the structure–property
relationship of polymer semiconductors. Bi-thieno[3,4]pyrrole-4,6-dione
(bi-TPD) is an interesting acceptor unit and has the advantages of
planar structure, extending π-conjugated length vs thieno[3,4]pyrrole-4,6-dione
(TPD), and minimizing conformational disorder with intramolecular
S···O interactions. Despite its merits, only few bi-TPD-based
polymers have been reported, and the ones related to the organic transistors
are even less.37−40 In this manuscript, bi-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione
(bi-TPD) and fluorinated oligothiophene copolymerized polymer semiconductor P1 was synthesized. P1 shows strong temperature-dependent
self-assembly behavior at relatively low solution temperature. With
a temperature-controlled dip-coating technique,41 the influence of preaggregation degree on the order and
charge carrier transport property of P1 films was systematically
investigated. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results reveal preaggregation degree has strong impact on the
quality of films. The variation of device performance (from 0 to 1.03
cm2 V–1 s–1) demonstrates
the importance in optimizing the preaggregation degree. The correlation
between preaggregation degree and transistor performance of P1 films is explored.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Physicochemical
Property of P1
The synthetic route of polymer
semiconductor P1 is
shown in Scheme 1. P1 was prepared by coupling monomers 1 and 2 via Pd-catalyzed Stille reaction. The crude polymer was
ultimately purified by precipitation into methanol, followed by successive
Soxhlet extractions with organic solvents. Its number-average molecular
weight (Mn) was measured with high-temperature
(150 °C) gel-permeation chromatography in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene
by using polystyrene as the standard. The Mn/polydispersity index (PDI) values were 54 kDa/1.82. The purity of P1 was characterized with elementary analysis. The thermal
property of P1 was investigated by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). P1 exhibited good thermal stability with a 5% weight loss
over 400 °C. No peaks were observed in the DSC curve in the temperature
range of 25–300 °C (Figure S1).

Scheme 1 Chemical Structure and Synthetic Route of P1
Figure 1a illustrates
the normalized UV–vis absorption spectra of P1 in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) solution at room temperature
and thin film. P1 has strong absorptions in the range
of 400–700 nm. The similarity of solution absorption and film
absorption indicated P1 was strongly aggregated in solution.
The corresponding optical energy band gap (Eg) of P1 is 1.82 eV, which was estimated from
the onset of the film absorption spectrum. To investigate the effect
of solution temperature on the preaggregation degree of P1, its absorption measurements were conducted at varied temperatures
(from 30 to 120 °C) (Figure 1b). It is clearly seen, with solution temperature increasing,
the intensity of absorption peak at 635 nm decreased. When the temperature
was above 60 °C, this peak was nonidentified. At the same time,
the absorption peak at 597 nm also changed gradually with the increase
of temperature, that is, the width got narrowed and the intensity
lowered instead of increased. This suggested the absorption peak at
635 nm did not disappear at higher temperature but was covered by
the absorption peak at 597 nm. The absorption changes of P1 indicated its aggregation behavior is temperature-sensitive and
can be controlled at relatively low temperature, which provides a
platform for investigating the effect of preaggregation degree on
the order of films and the performance of transistors.42,43

Morphology and Microstructure
of P1 Films
With the aim to minimize the change
of preaggregation degree during
the film deposition process, P1 films were deposited
with the temperature-controlled dip-coating technique (Figure 1d). In this technique, an oil
bath and a heating source were used to control the temperatures of P1 solution and substrate. To eliminate the temperature difference, P1 solutions and substrates were stood at a given temperature
for 1 h before each film deposition.

The microstructures and
orders of P1 films were investigated with AFM and X-ray
diffraction (Figure 2). Nanowire-type structures were clearly observed for the films deposited
at 40 and 50 °C. Notably, these films were very thin, and the
thickness was 3–4 nm for the films deposited at 40 °C
and 4–5 nm for those deposited at 50 °C (Figure S2), which provides a new way to prepare ultrathin
films. When the temperature was further increased, the size of microstructures
decreased, which was further proved by the scanning electron microscope
results (Figure S3), and demonstrated the
great effect of preaggregation degree on the microstructures of films.
No continuous films were obtained at 100 °C due to the low viscosity
of the solution and the high solvent evaporating rate at this temperature.

Figure 2 (a–f)
AFM images of P1 films deposited at different
solution temperatures. (g) Out-of-plane and (h) in-plane XRD patterns
of P1 films deposited at different solution temperatures.

Due to the low thickness, no diffraction
peaks were observed for
the films deposited at 40 and 50 °C (Figure 2g). Single-family Bragg reflections were
observed for the films deposited at higher temperatures. The intensity
of diffraction peaks was on the order of 70 °C > 80 °C
≈
60 °C > 90 °C, indicating the different order of films.
The distinct changes of the morphology and quality of P1 films demonstrate the importance of preaggregation degree. AFM and
XRD results suggested the preaggregation degree at 70 °C was
optimal for P1.

Charge Carrier Transport Property of P1 Films
To study the effect of preaggregation degree
on device performance,
the charge transport properties of P1 films deposited
through temperature-controlled dip coating were studied with field-effect
transistors. The devices were bottom-gate top-contacted structures. Figures 3 and S5 show the representative output and transfer
curves of the transistors, and the transistor performance is summarized
in Table 1.

films deposited with temperature-controlled dip coating (at 70 °C).

90	–15.6	104–5	0.50 (0.27 ± 0.17)	
a More than 20 devices
were measured
for the films deposited at each temperature.

The films dip coated at 40 °C did not show transistor
performance,
which was ascribed to their ultrathin films (only 3–4 nm).44,45 The thickness of films deposited at 50 °C was relatively thicker
(5–6 nm), and a mobility of 0.014 cm2 V–1 s–1 was observed. The device performance increased
dramatically when the temperature was 60 °C, and a mobility of
0.78 cm2 V–1 s–1 was
observed. The highest device performance was achieved for the films
dip coated at 70 °C, and a mobility of 1.03 cm2 V–1 s–1 was reached. The performance
of the devices gradually decreased, when the solution temperature
was further increased. The mobility was 0.94 cm2 V–1 s–1 for the films deposited at
80 °C and 0.50 cm2 V–1 s–1 for those deposited at 90 °C. The variation of device performance
was well consistent with the XRD and AFM results and proved the great
impact of preaggregation degree on device performance. Moreover, the
performance of the dip-coated device performance could not be further
optimized with thermal annealing, demonstrating the unique merit of
temperature-controlled dip-coating technique for flexible polymer
transistors.

To demonstrate the generality of preaggregation
degree on device
performance, P1 films were further deposited through
variable-temperature drop-casting technique. Due to the poor quality
of these films, which is a common disadvantage of drop-casting technique,
the mobility of drop-casting films was lower than that of dip-coating
ones. The highest mobility for drop-casting films is 0.18 cm2 V–1 s–1. As we expected, these
films showed the same trends in device performance as those deposited
through temperature-controlled dip coating (Table S2), further proving the importance of preaggregation on device
performance.

Conclusions
Bi-TPD and fluorinated
oligothiophene copolymerized polymer semiconductor P1 was synthesized and characterized. P1 displays
strong temperature-dependent aggregation behavior in solution. With
a temperature-controlled dip-coating technique, the effect of aggregation
behavior of P1 on the order and microstructures of films
and further the thin-film transistor performance were studied. Experimental
results showed the order and microstructures of P1 films
were modulated by changing the preaggregation of P1,
and the variation of transistor performance revealed the great impact
of preaggregation of P1. The device performance could
not be further optimized with post-treatment, demonstrating the unique
merit of the temperature-controlled dip-coating technique for high-performance
flexible polymer transistors. All these results show the importance
of tuning preaggregation during the fabrication of polymer transistors.

Device Fabrication and Characterization
Heavily n-doped
silicon wafers with a 300 nm SiO2 layer as the dielectric
layer were used as substrates for dip coating. The silicon wafers
were modified by octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The cleaning and
modification of silicon wafers were performed according to the reported
process.39

Films deposited with the
temperature-controlled dip-coating technique: 2.0 mg mL–1 of P1 in TCE solution was first heated to 90 °C
and stirred for 24 h. The solution was transported to the temperature-controlled
dip-coating machine. The solution was stood at a given temperature
for 1 h before film deposition. The parameters for dip coating are
30 s of immersed time and 25 mm min–1 of lifting
speed.

Films deposited with the varied-temperature drop-casting
technique: P1 was dissolved in TCE (0.05 mg mL–1).
Then, the solution and OTS-modified Si/SiO2 substrate were
heated to a given temperature. P1 films were prepared
by drop casting 40 μL solution onto the substrate.

The
transistors were bottom-gate top-contacted structures. Gold
source and drain electrodes (50 nm in thickness) were deposited under
vacuum with a shadow mask. The channel length and width were 31 and
273 μm, respectively. The transistor measurement was carried
out at room temperature by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter
analyzer in ambient condition. The mobilities were calculated in the
saturation regime according to the following equation: IDS = (μWCi/2L)(VG – VT)2, where IDS is
the drain–source current, W is the channel
width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric
layer, and VT is the threshold voltage.
