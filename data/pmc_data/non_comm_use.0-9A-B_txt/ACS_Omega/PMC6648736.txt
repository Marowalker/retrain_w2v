An efficient BCl3-mediated
reaction of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines has been developed
for the C–N, C–S,
and C–O bond formation. The salient features of this method
correspond to the substitution of different nucleophiles via in situ
unconventional debenzylation. The developed process is applicable
for the synthesis of a wide variety of ((3-amino/thio/alkoxy)-methyl)-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines.

Introduction
Substituted imidazopyridines
represent an important class of fused
heterocyclic compounds owing various pharmacological properties.1 Their analogues have been successfully used for
pharmaceutical chemistry as well as in materials science.2 Marketed drugs like alpidem,3 zolpidem,4 nicopidem and saripidem,5 minodronic acid,6 and
optically active GSK812397 drug7 are derived
from the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine scaffold (Figure 1).8

Figure 1 Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-derived drugs.

The construction of new C–N,9 C–S,10 and C–O11 bonds into organic molecules is highly appreciable
in modern chemistry. Although in recent times a variety of substitutions
on imidazopyridines have been made, there are no reports pertaining
to a general approach for the synthesis of different C–X bonds
at the C-3 methylene position of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines.
Recently, Hajra and group have presented the aminomethylation of imidazo-heterocycles
with morpholine using (diacetoxyiodo)benzene, and Kumar et al. approached
the synthesis by using N-methyl-morpholine oxide,
which acts as a coupling partner as well as the oxidant.12 Both of these strategies, however, suffer from
limitations in the context of (a) use of morpholine as only amine,
(b) not a general C–X bond approach, (c) requirement of halo-substituted
imidazopyridines as starting materials, (d) harsh reaction conditions,
and (e) low atom economy. In this context, we developed a BCl3-mediated general C–X bond formation method around
imidazopyridines that involve nucleophilic substitution reactions
with a diverse array of amines, thiols, and alcohols at the C-3 methylene
position (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Summary of Work
Benzyl protection of a hydroxyl group is one of the most
frequently
used procedures in synthesis because of the mild conditions involved
in its removal.13 Lewis acid has long been
widely used as an ether-cleaving reagent because of its tolerance
of several other functional groups in the target molecule.14

However, in the case of imidazopyridines,
we presumed an aza-directed
coupling with different nucleophiles through a resonance-stabilized
intermediate A. In this perspective, we present BCl3-mediated different reactions of imidazopyridines 1 (synthesized as per our earlier approach)15 against different N/S/O nucleophiles that helped to generate different
valuable carbon heterobonds.

Results and Discussion
We commenced
our study with 3-((benzyloxy) methyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1 (1.0 equiv) as the model substrate
to find out the optimized reaction conditions as summarized in Table 1. Initially, the reaction
was performed using BCl3 (1 equiv) and piperidine (1 equiv)
in dry dichloromethane (DCM) at −78 °C under a nitrogen
atmosphere for 2 h. Under these conditions, 2a was isolated
in 12% yield (Table 1, entry 1). Considering the gradual decrease in molarity of BCl3 solution over time due to high volatility of BCl3, 1.4 equiv of BCl3 was used, an improvement in yield
(32%) of the desired product 2a (entry 2) was noticed.16

b Isolated yield.

Following improvised yield of 2a, the
reaction conditions
particularly the change in the concentration of amine and variation
in temperature were explored (entries 3–12). Primarily, screening
of our reaction at different concentrations of amine against 1 was performed (entry 3 and 4), and the best result was observed
with 3 equiv of amine (entry 4). In continuation, various reactions
were conducted at different temperatures (entries 5–6). The
reaction executed at 0 °C produced better yield as compared to
reaction at 20 °C, indicating that 0 °C is an optimal temperature
for this transformation. Further, in the absence of Lewis acid, no
reaction was observed (entry 7). Subsequently, boron catalysts BF3O(C2H5)2 and BBr3 were also investigated in the presence of 3 equiv of piperidine
(entries 8–10) at −78 °C and 0 °C, but BCl3 was found most appropriate in terms of yield (entry 5). Also,
no product was observed in the case of AlCl3 (entry 12).
Finally, the use of BCl3 (1.4 equiv) and amine (3 equiv)
at 0 °C to room temperature (rt) under nitrogen was found to
be the optimized reaction condition (entry 3).

With these optimized
reaction conditions in hand, the scope of
the C3-methylene amination was demonstrated by testing a wide variety
of cyclic, acyclic, and aromatic amines. We were pleased to find that
in all tested reactions, the desired C3-aminomethylated-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines (Table 2, entries 2a–2x) were produced in good
yields (68–88%). 3-((Benzyloxy)methyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1 reacted efficiently with piperidine
and morpholine, giving the corresponding product 2a and 2c in 80 and 74% yields, respectively, and pyrrolidine yielded
product 2e with comparable yield (70%).The presence of
the electron-donating methyl group on imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines improved the yield to 82% (entries 2b and 2d). Reaction with aniline furnished product 2f in excellent yield (86%). Besides C2-phenyl substitution, the scope
and generality of the reaction was also investigated on C2 alkenylated
and alkynated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines17 for amination, and these groups were well tolerated
and afforded the products (entries 2g–2j) in good
yield (68–79%). In addition, different experiments were performed
between 2-iodo-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and various
amines to afford the desired products (entries 2h–2x). In this case, yields were also good for all the reactions conducted
irrespective of the nature of amine (Table 2). Reaction with piperidine (entry 2m, 83% yield) and morpholine (entry 2o, 76%)
proceeded very smoothly and comparatively more reactive than pyrrolidine
(entry 2l, 75% yield). The presence of the methyl group
on imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines further enhanced the yield
up to 87% (entry 2n) and chloro-substitution slightly
decreased the yield (entry 2x, 72%). Aniline and benzylamine
were also checked and afforded products 2s and 2t in excellent yields (80 and 88%, respectively). The use
of alkyne as a triazole precursor18 encouraged
us to perform reaction with propargyl amine and furnished the desired
product 2u in 87% yield without any difficulties. The
reaction was also compatible with the secondary amine diethylamine
(entries 2q and 2r) as well as the primary
amine n-propyl amine (entry 2w, 82%
yield), while in the case of hexamethylene diamine (2v), an inseparable mixture was obtained. In general, we observed that
irrespective the nature of imidazopyridines and amines, all of the
tested reactions were efficiently transformed to desired products
within 2 h.

yield.

To investigate the
practicability of this method, another set of
experiments were performed between imidazopyridine 1 and
thiols under the optimized reaction conditions and yields were generally
good for all tested reactions (entries 3a–3l)
(Table 3). Various
substituted aromatic and aliphatic thiols proceeded well in this process.
2-Mercaptopyridine smoothly underwent reaction with 1, affording the desired product 3a in 68% yield. Additionally,
the electron-donating group on the aromatic ring of thiophenol enhances
the yield of the desired product (entries 3b–3c). Reaction with n-octyl mercaptan (entry 3d) afforded the desired compound in good yield (64%). Moreover,
2-alkenyl (entry 3e) and alkynyl (entry 3f) substitution on 1 dropped the yield to 68 and 63%,
respectively. Importantly, mono- and dihalogen-substituted thiophenols
(entry 3i and 3j) worked well, thus providing
an opportunity for additional modifications of products. Notably,
2-iodo-substituted imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1 was also a good substrate for this reaction system (entries 3g–3l).

a Reaction conditions: 1 (0.3 mmol), BCl3 (0.42 mmol), and R4SH (0.9

b Isolated yields.

Next, we extended the method for
the generation of different C–O
bonds by treating different imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1 with different aliphatic alcohols as per the earlier optimal
conditions and successfully isolated different products (entries 4a–4j) in good yield (60–80%, Table 4). As evident, despite change
in the substitutions of 1, we isolated the desired products
in moderate to good yield (60–80%). However, reactions with
2-iodo substitutions (entries 4e–4i) produced
slightly better yields (68–80%). Furthermore, in these set
of reactions, the change in the aliphatic alcohols as the coupling
partner did not show a predominant effect in the reaction competence.
We successfully isolated the desired products with most of the alcohols
tested. However, we observed the best yields when reactions were conducted
with methanol (entries 4a, 4b, 4e, 4f, and 4j) and also found that increase
in alkyl chain length of alcohol (entries 4g, 4h, and 4i) and C-5 bromo substitution slightly decreased
the yield.

On
the basis of our observation and previous reports,18 a plausible mechanism is proposed in Scheme 2. Probably, at the
first step, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine 1 forms a complex with BCl3. This
complex converts into intermediate A (supported by mass
spectra) through aza-directed electronic delocalization. Subsequently,
the intermediate A is readily coupled with nucleophiles
to afford the desired compounds 2/3/4.

Scheme 2 Plausible Reaction Mechanism
Conclusions
In summary, BCl3-mediated methodologies
around imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines for the generation
of different C–N,
C–S, and C–O bonds through an in situ debenzylation
are presented. The reaction demonstrated a broad substrate scope and
excellent functional group tolerance at mild reaction conditions.
These methods furnished a wide variety of 3-amino/thio/alkoxy 2-iodo-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines in good yields and are perhaps ascertained because
of aza-directed unusual coupling with different nucleophiles.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All reactions and purity of the
synthesized compounds were monitored by Merck thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) using silica gel 60 F254 aluminum plates (20 × 20 cm).
Visualization was accomplished by UV spectrometry at 254 nm light
and exposure to iodine vapors. Buchi rotavapor was used for concentration
of organic solvents. Column chromatographic purifications were performed
on silica gel (100–200 mesh) for compound purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra in CDCl3 were
recorded with 400 and 500 MHz NMR instruments, respectively, using
(CH3)4Si as an internal standard. Chemical shifts
(δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm, scale) referenced
to the residual solvent (i.e., 1H 7.24 ppm and 13C 77.1 ppm for CDCl3). MestReNova software was used to
process NMR spectra. Signal multiplicity is expressed as follows:
s (singlet), br s (broad singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet),
and m (multiplet). J values are given in hertz (Hz).
Mass spectra were obtained by using a Q-TOF-LC/MS spectrometer using
electron spray ionization. Unless otherwise indicated, materials and
solvents were purchased and used without further purification. All
starting compounds 1 (3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-2-iodoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, 3-((benzyloxy) methyl)-2-arylimidazo [1,2-a]pyridine, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-2-(phenylethynyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, and 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-2-styrylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) were synthesized compared with the spectroscopic
data by following the literature reports.15

General Procedure for C3-Methylene C–N Bond Formation
of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (2)
In a round-bottom flask, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]-pyridine 1 (0.3 mmol) was dissolved in dry
DCM (2 mL) at 0 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. A BCl3 solution (1.0 M in methylene chloride) (0.42 mmol) was slowly added,
and complex formation was confirmed by TLC. After that, temperature
of reaction was increased up to rt and an amine (0.9 mmol) was added
and stirred for 2 h (reaction progress was monitored by TLC). After
completion, the reaction was quenched by water to stop the reaction.
The aqueous solution was extracted with DCM (3 × 10 mL). The
combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, and evaporated in vacuum. The residue
was purified by a column (silica gel, 80/20 n-hexane/ethyl
acetate) to give the desired product.

General Procedure for C3-Methylene C–S Bond Formation
of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (3)
A solution of 3-((benzyloxy) methyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (0.3 mmol) in dry DCM (2 mL) was stirred at 0
°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. BCl3 solution (1.0
M in methylene chloride) (0.42 mmol) was slowly added, and complex
formation was confirmed by TLC. Then, reaction was transferred to
rt and a solution of an organosulfur in DCM (0.9 mmol) was added,
and reaction was continuously stirred for 2 h (reaction progress was
monitored by TLC). After completion, the reaction was quenched by
water to stop the reaction. The aqueous solution was extracted with
DCM (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated
in vacuum. The residue was purified by a column (silica gel, 80/20 n-hexane/ethyl acetate) to give the desired product 3.

General Procedure for C3-Methylene C–O Bond Formation
of Imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (4)
A solution of 3-((benzyloxy) methyl)-2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (0.3 mmol) in dry DCM (2 mL) was stirred at 0
°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. BCl3 solution (1.0
M in methylene chloride) (0.42 mmol) was slowly added, and complex
formation was confirmed by TLC. After that, reaction was allowed to
raise temperature up to rt. Alcohol (500 μL) was added, and
reaction was further stirred for another 2 h (reaction progress was
monitored by TLC). After completion, the reaction was quenched by
water to stop the reaction. The aqueous solution was extracted with
DCM (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated
in vacuum. The residue was purified by a column (silica gel, 80/20 n-hexane/ethyl acetate) to give the desired product 4.
