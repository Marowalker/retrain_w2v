The present study demonstrates the
near-field effect of silver
nanostructure island films (SNIFs) on the photophysics and exited-state
dynamics of quinine sulphate (QS) and its di-cation (QSD), doped in
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films. The results indicate a nearly 3.8-fold
enhancement in absorption and 4000-fold enhancement in fluorescence
in SNIF-coated QS-doped PVA films, whereas only twofold enhancement
in absorption and sevenfold enhancement in fluorescence intensity
are found in SNIF-coated QSD-doped PVA films. However, an increase
in photostability and a decrease in decay time have been observed
in both the SNIF-coated films as compared to their uncoated forms.
Further, a decrease in the magnitude of the edge excitation red shift
in emission spectra along with a red shift in the La band
and a rise in the intensity of the Lb band of excitation
is observed in SNIF-coated QSD films because of strong coupling of
the Lb band with the surface plasmons of silver nanoparticles.
Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurement of silver
nanoparticle-coated QS–PVA films shows no change in 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 transitions of silver, whereas the
decrease in energy in these silver transitions in the QSD–PVA
system is observed as compared to silver nanoparticle-coated PVA films.
These results indicate the formation of a field-governed radiating
plasmon and plasmon-coupled unified fluorophore system, respectively.
This affects the photophysics of both of the molecules by plasmonic
coupling of the Frank–Condon state, solvent relaxation state,
and charge-transfer state by different orders of magnitude.

1 Introduction
The surface plasmon’s
interaction of metallic nanoparticles
with fluorophores drastically and favorably changes the photophysics1−4 and bioactivity5−8 of the molecules. The collective oscillations of surface electrons
of metallic nanoparticles regulate the confinement of excitation and
emitted radiation, which is accountable for the strange properties
of such metallic nanomaterials. On changing the shape and size of
these nanoparticles, the plasmonic band can be tuned with the absorption
band of a nearby fluorophore, which controls the fluorescence dynamics
of it through the near-field effect.9−12 The distinctive physicochemical
properties of such hybrid nanomaterials lead to the development of
chemosensors13−16 and biosensors17 for diagnosis and treatment
of diseases,18,19 detection of pathogenic agents,20,21 drug delivery,22−25 and so forth. As nanosized metallic particles show toxicity in a
variety of organisms, these nanoparticles may constitute a toxicological
risk, being generally more toxic than bulk26 and plasmon resonance-enhanced photoelectrodes’ and photocatalysts’
activity.27 Therefore, the study of the
interaction of nanomaterials with drug molecules is significant because
of their induced toxicity that would modify some specific biological
functions in living systems.28 However,
the toxicological risk will be reduced in hybrid or functionalized
nanomaterials.

Contemporary research has witnessed the emergence
of metallic nanoparticle-coated
drugs as more effective drugs. Among the heterocyclic compounds, quinoline
derivatives (cinchona alkaloids) are of great interest owing to their
pharmaceutical and industrial applications.29 Therefore, the study of their spectral and photophysical properties
near the surface or interface of metals holds significance. A few
studies of quinine sulphate (QS) and its derivatives have been reported
for their use as an optical sensing material for halides and some
metal ions.8 The past few decades have
witnessed extensive studies being carried out on photophysics and
photochemistry of QS in bulk liquids30−35 and some restricted environments.36−41 The protonated species of QS (QSD) shows a red shift in both the
absorption and emission spectra with respect to QS, which is attributed
to perturbations of the π–π* and n−π*
states.23 The molecular structures of QS
and QSD molecules are presented in Scheme 1. QSD is found to be more photostable, more
immune toward oxygen-quenching, and to have a high fluorescence quantum
yield [ϕ = 0.55] owing to its stable circular structure.30 The time-domain fluorescence measurement of
QS at ambient temperature shows dual decay time τ1 and τ2 in a nanosecond timescale, which corresponds
to a two-state model. However, QSD also shows dual decay time, in
which τ2 increases with increase in monitored wavelength
of emission spectra because of the solvent relaxation process, whereas
τ1 exhibits a rise time behavior, which also resembles
a two-state model with a negative amplitude of the decay time in the
red edge of the emission wavelength.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structure
of (a) QS and (b) QSD
Meech and Phillips33 have reported
the
nonexponential decay of QSD with the emission wavelengths because
of a change in the charge density distribution and geometry of the
molecule. Further, in a temperature-dependent steady-state and time-domain
fluorescence measurement of QSD from 80 to 290 K, Pant et al.34 proposed two major relaxation processes to understand
this complex fluorescence dynamics of QSD, first, a charge-transfer
process which occurs around 160 K and second, a solvent reorientation
process taking place in the liquid phase. Interestingly, QSD is one
of the exceptional emitters in which excited-state solvent relaxation
occurs in a nanosecond timescale even at room temperature. Therefore,
time-resolved emission spectroscopy and other dynamic studies, which
depend on solvent relaxation, could easily be made using QSD as an
emitter.35 However, these characteristics
show that QSD cannot be used as a fluorescence lifetime standard.
Further, some unusual characteristics of QSD in emission and excitation
spectra, viz. polarization and the bathochromic shift in the emission
spectrum on excitation at the red edge of the first absorption band
and the excitation spectrum of QS is not found mirror image of the
absorption spectrum, suggested that the emission arises simultaneously
from two close-lying states.42,43 On excitation at the
red edge of the absorption band, only certain configurations are excited,
resulting in a red-shifted emission, which lacks some high-frequency
components compared to emission because of short-wavelength excitation.
Fletcher44 has postulated that the edge
excitation red shift (EERS) effect which arises because of the solvent
bonding to the chromospheres restricts the position of the auxochrome
to at least two average conformers, having its own distinct electronic
transition probabilities. However, the excitation dependence of the
emission of polar aromatic molecules in viscous polar solvents is
not a common phenomenon, and it is related to the microenvironmental
heterogeneity.45,46 Generally, the EERS of a probe
molecule is used for detection of free volume in the polymer matrix,42 and is a powerful tool to monitor the organization
and dynamics of membranes, micelles, and reverse micelles.43 Mishra et al.47 reported
a decrease in the EERS, fluorescence lifetimes, time-dependent fluorescence
Stokes shift, and fluorescence depolarization in concentration-dependent
studies of QSD ions in an aqueous medium and suggested that the energy
migration among the QSD ions along with solvent relaxation is responsible
for this process. The appearance of the change of the EERS in QSD
in different protic/aprotic polymers,39 and micelles,47 indicates that the QSD
molecule is very sensitive for surface or interface studies and can
also be used as a probe to investigate the mobility of solvent molecules
around the excited molecules.

The present work describes the
effects of the plasmons of silver
nanostructure island films (SNIFs) on the excited-state dynamics and
photophysics of QS and its di-cation, QSD, doped in a polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) polymeric matrix. Since the dynamics of charge transfer (CT),
solvent relaxation and magnitude of EERS of QS and QSD depend upon
the polarity and free volume of the polymer matrix. Therefore, the
present study will enable us to understand the near field effect of
SNIF on these excited state relaxation processes, which affact the
fluorescence dynamics of these molecules at the surface/interface
of silver nanoparticles in the restricted free volume and microenvironment.

2 Results and Discussion
The photophysical experimental
measurement and finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) calculation49 shows
that a nearly 20 nm thin layer of silver over silica nanoparticles
gives maximum enhancement in emission intensity. Therefore, in the
present study, only a 20 nm thin Ag film with a deposition rate of
1 Å/s has been deposited over the PVA film. The morphology of
the SNIF over the PVA film was obtained by using field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta-200) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM, NT-MTD, Russia), respectively, as shown in Figure 1.

of 20 nm SNIFs [size 2 μm ×
2 μm].

2.1 Steady-State
Absorption and Fluorescence Measurements
Overlapped absorption,
fluorescence, and decay curves of QS and
QSD molecules doped in PVA thin films with and without silver nanoparticle
coating are shown in Figure 2. QS doped on the PVA film shows absorption band maximum at
335 nm along with a hump at 325 nm, which corresponds to La and Lb transitions, respectively, in the QS molecule
having π → π* characteristics along with other
two higher electronic-state transitions lying between the 200 and
300 nm range at 240 and 280 nm. A nearly 3.8-fold enhancement is observed
in this absorption band in the silver nanoparticle-coated QS-doped
PVA film [Figure 2a]
with respect to the uncoated QS-doped PVA film. Further, an increase
in optical density at the red edge of the absorption band is also
observed in SNIF-coated films. In the case of the QSD-doped PVA film,
the La band is red-shifted and observed at 352 nm, whereas
the Lb band is found to be blue-shifted and observed at
317 nm, along with other two higher electronic transition states lying
in at 220 and 250 nm, similar to the QS-doped PVA film. Further, only
about twofold enhancement is observed in La, and Lb absorption bands in the SNIF-coated QSD-doped PVA film [Figure 2d] with respect to
the QSD–PVA film without SNIF coating. The enhancement in the
absorbance of QS and QSD is observed because of the enhanced near-field
effect of SNIFs by interaction of the incident photon flux. The changes
in the magnitudes of enhancement in the absorbance of QS and QSD molecule
are due to different modes of interactions of the photon flux with
these two molecules near the SNIF, which is consistent with X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopic measurements.

(a, d), emission (b, e), and decay curves
(c, f) of QS- and QSD-doped PVA films (i) without and (ii) with silver
SNIF coating.

In the fluorescence spectrum,
the QS-doped PVA film shows a very
weak fluorescence band at 365 nm upon excitation by 340 nm [inset
of Figure 2b]. In the
SNIF-coated QS-doped PVA film, this fluorescence band intensity enhances
nearly 4000-fold, under the same condition, without changing the shape
or structure of the fluorescence band, though a blue shift is observed
having the magnitude of ∼20 Å as shown in the normalized
spectrum [Figure 3a].
The enhancement factor is defined as the ratio of intensity observed
in the SNIF-coated sample film divided by that from a PVA control
substrate under identical conditions. The QSD-doped PVA film shows
a red-shifted fluorescence band, observed at 450 nm as shown in Figure 2e with respect to
the QS-doped PVA film, but in the SNIF-coated QSD-doped PVA film,
this fluorescence band intensity enhances only sevenfold along with
a blue shift of about 60 Å nm as shown in the normalized spectrum
[Figure 2b]. The observed
blue shift is similar to the previously reported results in metal-enhanced
fluorescence (MEF) because of a change in the dipole moment.50 Further, the blue shift in the fluorescence
band of QSD is found to be greater than QS in the SNIF-coated film.

2.2 Time-Domain Fluorescence
Measurements
The analyzed overlapped decay curves of both
QS- and QSD-doped PVA
films, with and without SNIF coating, are shown in Figure 2c,f, respectively, and the
corresponding fitted decay data are presented in Table 1. As evident from the results,
the fluorescence decay of both the QS and QSD reduces in SNIF-coated
films with reference to the uncoated QS or QSD PVA films.

QSD Doped in the PVA Film with and without SNIF at 400 nm; λex = 375 nm

The QS doped in the PVA film shows a fluorescence
peak at 365 nm,
which decays double exponentially with decay times of 1.42 and 4.32
ns. In SNIF, the decay curve of QS doped in the PVA best fitted in
the triple exponential decay function, and both the magnitude and
amplitude of these decay parameters (i.e., 1.35 and 3.55 ns) decrease
with respect to the SNIF-coated sample with the appearance of an additional
short decay time of ∼0.02 ns. Further, an average decay time
of 3.01 ns and an amplitude-weighted value of about 0.07 ns have been
calculated for QS. These values are reduced to 0.88 and 0.29 ns, respectively,
in SNIF-deposited PVA films. The decrease in the magnitude of the
decay parameters along with an increase in fluorescence intensity
in the presence of SNIF indicates the plasmonic coupling of Frank–Condon
(FC) and relaxed (R) excited state of the free space component of
QS with SNIF nanoparticles. However, the appearance of an additional
very short decay time component indicates the proximity of the QS
to the SNIF, which is consistent with reports on the fluorescence
of other fluorophore intensities near silver nanoparticles. The appearance
of the additional fast decay channel supports the blue shift of fluorescence
in the presence of SNIFs.

However, the QSD doped in the PVA
film decays triple exponentially,
having a decay time of 2.39, 8.28, and 17.68 ns, respectively. Further,
a long decay component of 17.68 ns along with two short decay components
correspond to FC and relaxed state as in the case of the QS-doped
PVA film. It indicates two major relaxation processes, viz., a charge-transfer
process and a solvent reorientation process, which occurs in the polymeric
medium.47 Furthermore, in SNIF, these three
decay times of QSD reduce in a similar trend to QS in PVA, which again
indicates plasmonic coupling of the FC state, relaxed-excited state,
and CT state with SNIF nanoparticles. The increase in the amplitude
of the short decay time component and a decrease in the amplitude
of the long decay time component again supports the blue shift of
fluorescence in the presence of SNIF. The reduction in decay times
in the presence of SNIF indicates the coupling of excited states of
QS with plasmons of the SNIF and the subsequent nonradiative energy
transfer from both the excited state of QS to metal particles, which
is consistent with the previously proposed MEF model.48 In essence, the reduced lifetimes are because the metal
itself radiates the coupled quanta with the very short lifetime, decreasing
the amplitude-weighted excited-state lifetime.

2.3 EERS
Emission Spectral Measurements
In order to have an insight
into the effect of plasmons of SNIF on
the photophysics of red edge excitation for both kinds of QSD-doped
PVA films (i.e., with and without SNIF coating) measurements were
performed. The measured excitation spectra, by monitoring emission
at different wavelengths, emission spectra, excited by the different
wavelengths of the red edge of the absorption band, and decay profile
at different emission wavelengths (are provided in Figure 4). Normalized overlapped excitation
spectra of QSD in the PVA matrix are shown in Figure 4a, which shows a small blue shift in the
La band with no change in the position and intensity of
the Lb band on monitoring the emission spectra at 400,
500, and 530 nm.

Figure 4 Overlapped (a) excitation spectra [emission monitored
at different
emission wavelengths], (b) emission spectra [excited by different
wavelengths], and (c) decay curves [decay monitored at different wavelengths]
of QSD-doped PVA films. Overlapped (d) excitation spectra [emission
monitored at different emission wavelengths], (e) emission spectra
[excited by different wavelengths], and (f) decay curves [decay monitored
at different wavelengths] of QSD-doped PVA films coated with SNIF.

However, in the case of SNIF-coated
QSD-doped PVA films, for the
same monitored emission wavelengths, a large blue shift in the La band and an increase in the intensity of the Lb band is observed (Figure 4d) as compared to the uncoated sample. In the case of the
EERS emission spectra, a shift of ∼713 cm–1 is observed in QSD fluorescence spectra doped in the PVA films as
shown in normalized emission spectra (Figure 4b), on exciting the sample from 350, 375
and 390 nm, respectively, whereas the magnitude of EERS is found to
be decreased up to 320 cm–1 in the case of the SNIF-coated
QSD-doped PVA matrix. Further, in time domain measurements, a regular
increase in the magnitude of three decay times is observed, on monitoring
the decay toward the red edge of the emission spectra of the QSD-doped
PVA matrix both with and without SNIF coating (Figure 4c,f). However, a reduction in all the three
decay times is observed in the SNIF-coated QSD film throughout the
emission profile with respect to the QSD-doped PVA film.

Similar
effects of a change in intensity and shift in fluorescence
emission toward a longer wavelength in the fluorescence characteristics
of QSD doped in sol–gel glasses filled with solvent after poly(methyl
methacrylate) impregnation were compared previously.51 These changes were explained by the free volume available
within polymer films. The broad distribution-function model,39,47 representing various species which are not interconvertible during
the lifetime of the solute, shows the presence of EERS of QSD in glass
and polymeric media. However, it could not explain the absence of
any rising portion in the decay of these media. Therefore, the presence
of multicomponent decay can be explained because of the trapping of
the molecule in different geometries. However, the absence of negative
amplitude does not rule out the possibility of excited-state CT. In
the broad distribution model, the multicomponent decay curve can be
well fitted in two or three components. It has been reported that
the decay of QSD in the compact aprotic polymer film and dried Nafion
film becomes triple exponential.39 The
additional decay time is found to be 10 ns, which may be due to the
presence of a fraction of QSD molecules which are bonded to the polymer
chain at a higher viscosity site. As mentioned earlier, in fluid media
the EERS can be rationalized by the fact that the excitation of the
solute is accompanied by a large change in dipole moment and the solvent
reorientation time is not fast enough to bring the molecule to the
relaxed state during the decay time.

On the other hand, EERS
in the frozen glass at 80 K can be explained
by the trapping of the molecule in different geometries.34 Therefore, free volume effect also plays an
important role in explaining the kinetics of adsorbed molecules. On
increasing the rigidity of the film, it will reduce the free space
available for the molecules and restrict their motion. This causes
increase in both decay time and fluorescence intensity. However, in
the QSD-doped PVA polymer matrix in the presence of SNIF, there is
a decrease in EERS. Probably, the molecules are oriented in a particular
direction, hence restricting their motion in the free space available
in the PVA matrix. Further, the increase in absorbance of the Lb band in the presence of SNIF may be due to a strong coupling
of surface plasmons of SNIF with the polarized transition state along
the bonds (Lb) because of the interaction of photon flux.
The blue shift in the La band of the QSD molecule in the
presence of SNIF is due to near-field-induced change in the dipole
moment.

2.4 Photostability Measurements
To understand
the change in magnitude of MEF in QS- and QSD-doped polymer films
coated with SNIF with respect to uncoated films, the photostability
of these films were also measured. These films were exposed to the
light of wavelength 350 nm from a 150 W xenon lamp for about 900 s,
and the change in fluorescence intensity at 400 nm was measured as
a function of time as depicted in overlapped photostability curves
in Figure 5. The photostability
of the QS is found to be more pronounced with respect to QSD on the
SNIF-coated PVA film as compared to the reference sample films (without
silver coating). The observed results of enhanced fluorescence photostability
are consistent with the shortening of the decay time of QS and QSD
near SNIF as proposed in the MEF model.48

Figure 5 Overlapped
photostability curves of the (i) QS- and (ii) QSD-doped
PVA film in the absence of SNIF, whereas (iii) and (iv) show photostability
of QSD and QS in the presence of SNIFs.

2.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Measurements
of Silver Near the QS- and QSD-Doped PVA Film
To understand
the huge change in the encasement factor of absorbance and fluorescence
intensity of QSD with respect to QS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurement was carried out. The overlapped XPS spectra of thermally
deposited over QS and QSD (with and without coating) are shown in Figure 6. Silver shows binding
energy transitions:43 3d3/2 and
3d5/2 at 378 and 372.5 eV, respectively, in the bare SNIF-coated
PVA film (Figure 6i).
It is also clear from Figure 6ii that there is no change in the binding energy transitions
of Ag in the SNIF-coated QS-doped PVA film, whereas the binding energy
of both the transition of silver is decreased along with a decrease
in intensity in the QSD-doped PVA film coated with SNIF (Figure 6iii) as compared
to the bare SNIF-coated PVA film. The observed results confirm the
creation of a fluorophore–plasmon coupled integrated system
of the QSD-doped PVA film with silver nanostructures, by chemical-adsorption
(via weak van der Waals forces). In this unified system, partial CT
from QSD to SNIF takes place and causes a drop in the binding energy
and induces very less enhancement in fluorescence intensity. However,
in the case of the QS-doped PVA film, no change in binding energy
indicates the formation of a field-controlled radiating plasmon-fluorophore
unified system.

Figure 6 X-ray photoelectron spectra of thermally coated 10 nm
thick silver
nanoparticles on the (i) PVA film (ii) QSD-doped PVA film and (iii)
QS-doped PVA film.

Thus, because of the
field effect of surface plasmon coupled fluorescence,
a huge enhancement in the absorption/fluorescence band and a decrease
in decay time is observed along with an increase in photostability.
The current understanding of MEF is supported by a model, according
to which the nonradiative energy transfer occurs from excited fluorophores
(dipoles) to surface plasmons in noncontinuous films. Coupling of
the surface plasmons of SNIF with the FC-state and relaxed-excited
state (R-state) is shown in Scheme 2.

3 Conclusions
The present study shows that the photophysics and photochemistry
of QS and its di-cation drastically change by the presence of silver
nanostructures. Enhancement in the absorption, emission, photostability,
and quenching in decay time confirms the coupling between surface
plasmons of silver nanoparticles with the excited states of QS and
its di-cationic species in PVA films. Further, in the case of the
QS-doped PVA film, no change in the XPS spectrum indicates that field-induced
surface plasmon coupling is responsible for the huge enhancement in
fluorescence intensity; however, the red shift in the XPS spectrum
in the case of the QSD-doped PVA film indicates the creation of the
fluorophore–plasmon coupled unified system causing less enhancement
in fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, in the QSD-doped PVA film,
decrease in EERS and raise in absorbance of the Lb band
in the presence of SNIF point out the formation of the fluorophore–plasmon
coupled system and restricted motion of the QSD molecule in the free
volume of the PVA matrix. Most significantly, the results show that
near-field surface plasmons can enhance and govern the photophysics
of neutral as well as di-cationic species of QS, which will have greater
worth in the development of next-generation smart materials for diverse
applications in pharmacy and industry.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Quinine sulfate (QS) and
PVA (molecular weight 9000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. QS
molecule-doped PVA films were prepared by mixing the required amount
of PVA grains dissolved in hot water at 40 °C. The estimated
concentration of different films is about 0.5 wt %. Purity was checked
by a fluorescence run test of the neat polymer film. QSD-doped PVA
films were prepared by mixing PVA grains with QS in 0.1 N H2SO4 and dissolving it in water. The mass was spread in
a propylene dish and dried in an incubator.

4.2 Construction
of SNIFs
Vacuum thermal
evaporation/deposition technique at 10–6 mbar using
HIND HIVAC 12A4D was used to construct the SNIF over PVA film. In
our previous work,48 we had observed that
the depositions of the ultrathin film (<7 nm) of Ag metals cause
formations of quenched condense nanofilms with charge confinement
(Ts < 0.1Tm, where Ts is substrate temperature during
deposition and Tm is the melting point
of Ag).

4.3 Instrumentation
Absorption spectra
of QS- and QSD-doped PVA films on blank glass substrates and SNIF
films were obtained using a double beam JASCO V-670 UV/vis spectrophotometer.
Emission spectra were recorded by an Edinburgh fluorescence spectrophotometer
having a 150 W xenon source for excitation. A front face sample was
used to undertake all the fluorescence measurements with a slit width
of 3 nm, both in the excitation monochromator and emission monochromator
channels. Fluorescence decays were also measured by an Edinburgh fluorescence
lifetime system FLS-920 instrument, employing the time-correlated
single photon counting technique, with an R985 PMT detection module.
The excitation source was a pulsed laser source of wavelength 375
nm having maximum repetition rate of 1.0 MHz pulse duration and 73.5
ps pulse width. The intensities of the decay curves were analyzed
by associated decay analysis software regarding the multiexponential
model  where αi’s and τi’s are amplitude
and decay times, respectively and ∑iαi = 1.0. The fractional contribution
of each component to the steady-state intensity is given by  

The mean lifetime of the excited state
is given by  and the amplitude-weighted lifetime is given
by  

The values
of αi’s and
τi’s were determined by nonlinear
least squares impulse re-convolution analysis with the goodness of
fit adjudged by the residual, autocorrelation function and chi square
(χ2) values. In decay time analysis, the measurement
of the error was of the order of 0.01 ns. Photostability experiments
were undertaken using a 150 W xenon lamp with a neutral density filter
for 350 nm excitation and change in emission intensity recorded at
400 nm of the sample films with an Ocean optics spectrophotometer
HP-2000 in a time scan of about 900 s. XPS measurements of the sample
films were carried out with the help of Kratos Analytical, Shimadzu
group company AMICUS XPS UK.
