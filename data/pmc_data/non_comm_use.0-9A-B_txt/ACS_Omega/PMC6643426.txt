Temperature, reactant concentration,
bubble flow field characteristics,
and mass-transfer characteristics play an important role in flue gas
desulfurization of basic aluminum sulfate (aluminum base). The influence
of various factors on desulfurization efficiency (ηabs) was determined from the macroscopic and microscopic levels through
experiments and numerical simulations. The temperature of absorption
solution had a significant effect on ηabs, and low
temperature was advantageous for SO2 absorption performance
of aluminum base. The value of ηabs increased with
increasing reactant concentration. When the aluminum base concentration
was higher than 50%, ηabs remained above 90%. The
low aluminum base shortened the beginning time of the rapid decline
of ηabs. This outcome was related to the low concentration
of active Al2O3. At a low concentration range
of 2000–5000 ppm of inlet SO2, the reaction rate
determined the ηabs level, and gas-phase mass-transfer
resistance was the main factor restricting the increase in ηabs. However, reaction rate and gas-phase mass-transfer resistance
determined the ηabs level when the inlet SO2 concentration was as high as 50 000 ppm. The aeration rate
affected the bubble size, number, and diffusion state. In addition,
a higher aeration rate reduced the gas–liquid contact time
and speeded up the consumption of aluminum base. As a result, bubbles
along the absorber height showed different desulfurization characteristics,
that is, 0–0.1 m was the initial stage of bubble formation
and desulfurization (the ηabs was lower than 15%),
0.1–0.34 m was the main stage of bubble diffusion and desulfurization
(the ηabs rapidly increased to 86.4%), and 0.34–0.4
m was the stable stage of desulfurization (the ηabs slowly increased to 92.5%).

1 Introduction
Basic aluminum sulfate
(aluminum base) desulfurization is a technology
characterized by the use of renewable absorbent and SO2 recyclability. Benefiting from the thermal desorption regeneration
of absorbent, it reduced the limestone consumption due to aluminum
base supplement and indirectly reduced the secondary pollution of
CO2 emissions from the traditional limestone gypsum desulfurization.
In this process, preliminary studies at home and abroad mainly focused
on the improvement of engineering parameters at the macrolevel in
the 1940–1980s of the 20th century. Although this process exhibits
high desulfurization efficiency (ηabs), the insufficiency
of basic research on the physical and chemical mechanisms and quantitative
relationship resulted in difficulties in engineering application.1−3 Since 2000, domestic scholars conducted experimental research on
interactions among parameters and mainly discussed basic desulfurization
characteristics under the static absorption system.4−10 Considering that bubble absorber exhibits the characteristics of
simple structure, convenient operation, large interphase contact area,
and good mass-transfer effect, studies must investigate the mechanism
and characteristics of aluminum base desulfurization under this system
for practical application.11−13

Scholars have analyzed
bubble characteristics and their influence
on chemical processes. Yuan et al.14 studied
the influence of height–diameter ratio of the bubble reactor
and chemical reaction conditions on the flue gas decarburization performance
of ammonia water; results concluded that increasing the ratio of height
to diameter effectively increased the CO2 absorption rate.
Song et al.15 studied the bubble size,
distribution, and local gas holdup rate under different aeration rates
in a bubble column and obtained the probability density distribution
of different bubble sizes. The bubble distribution increased with
increasing axial height under high aeration rate. Yan et al.16 adopted the dynamic gas evolution method to
examine the effects of liquid viscosity and operating conditions on
bubble model parameters, such as bubble content, rising velocity,
and total gas content, in the bubble column; the diameter of large
bubbles increased slightly with increasing viscosity, whereas the
diameter of small bubbles decreased dramatically. To explore the characteristics
of seawater desulfurization, Qing and Xiao17 carried out desulfurization experiment of simulated exhaust gas
on a ship on an independently designed jet bubble column system by
changing parameters such as exhaust gas flow, seawater temperature,
immersion depth, SO2 inlet concentration, and O2 concentration; the results revealed the relationship between exhaust
gas flow rate and mass-transfer coefficient.

To apply a bubble
absorber to desulfurization engineering, Bin
et al.18,19 analyzed the process and operating parameters
of the jet bubble column desulfurization technology in a domestic
600 MW thermal power plant. The effects of injection pipe immersion
depth, inlet SO2 concentration, pH of the absorption solution,
oxidation amount, agitation speed on SO2 removal efficiency,
lime utilization rate, scaling conditions, and reliability were determined.
Min20 experimentally studied the desulfurization
of the bubble column in a 600 MW thermal power unit of Taishan Power
Plant and found that the change in pH had greater effect on ηabs than the change in liquid level. Jin et al.21 experimentally investigated the reaction dynamic
characteristics under bubble-type desulfurization tower in a 4.2 MW
hot water boiler and used double-membrane theory to numerically calculate
the ηabs of flue gas. The results showed that ηabs was sensitive to the inlet smoke temperature; that is,
it increased with decreasing inlet smoke temperature.

Through
numerical calculation of bubble column, Juan and Qin22 established a mathematical model of flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) based on pilot-scale injection bubble reactor
of whole mixed flow to determine component concentration, pH, and
SO2 absorption rate. Considering the effect of bubble coalescence
and fragmentation on bubble size, Guang et al.23,24 numerically simulated the gas–liquid two-phase flow in a
bubble column reactor and evaluated reasonable axial velocity, gas
holdup rate, and turbulent kinetic energy distribution.

At present,
bubble-type absorption devices are mostly used for
experiment or simulation of the physical flow field or chemical reaction
characteristics of bubbles from a single aspect. Aluminum base desulfurization
is a process with chemical mass transfer and involves chemical reaction
and kinetic properties of interface zone. Macroscopic analysis alone
is insufficient to comprehensively evaluate the unique properties
of the interface and its vicinity. Thus, the interface needs to be
studied from near microscopic experiments combined with microscopic
analysis.25 The interface has wide applicability
and reliability theoretically and is suitable to industrial application.

In this study, the influence of different factors on the desulfurization
performance of aluminum base in a bubbler absorber was studied experimentally.
The desulfurization mechanism of bubble formation, diffusion, and
microscopic mass transfer during desulfurization was also investigated
using numerical simulations accompanied by chemical reactions. This
work provides theoretical reference for industrial application of
aluminum base FGD by bubbles.

2 Experiment and Numerical
Simulation
2.1 Experimental Method
The chemical reaction of aluminum base desulfurization is shown
in eq 1 1  

The basic absorption
solution was prepared
and used as 100% concentration with an aluminum amount (amount of
Al2O3 converted by aluminum ions) of 25 g/L
and a basicity (x) of 25%. Then, the absorption solution
with a fixed volume of 2000 mL in different concentrations could be
obtained by adjusting the volume fraction of deionized water and basic
absorption solution. Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus system and related parameters.
By controlling the volume flow of SO2 and air, different
concentrations of simulated flue gas were prepared, and then, the
aeration rate at the inlet of the absorber could be determined. At
the same time, the absorber outlet SO2 concentration was
measured by a flue gas analyzer. Thus, the experimental study was
performed according to the scheme designed for experimental purpose.

Figure 1 Flow diagram
of the experimental apparatus system.

In this system, the design of a front mixing cylinder and
a rear
buffer bottle was used to ensure a uniform absorber inlet SO2 concentration. The absorption experiment at different temperatures
could be carried out by placing the absorber in a constant-temperature
water bath (adjustable temperature) and wrapping insulation layer
outside. The formation and diffusion of bubbles were captured by high-speed
cameras.

ηabs was defined as shown in eq 2, where yin and yout are the mole (volume)
fractions in ppm of
SO2 at the inlet and outlet of the absorber, respectively. 2  

Previous studies by the author
showed that pH was the result of
the combined effect of initial concentration of aluminum base solution
and SO2 absorption.5,26 Therefore, we selected
temperature, aluminum base solution concentration, inlet SO2 concentration, and aeration rate as the main factors to carry out
the experimental research on the mechanism and performance of bubbling
desulfurization with chemical mass transfer from the microlevel.

2.2 Simulation Method
In this paper,
the simulation method was the same as that of previous publications
of the author, in which ANSYS’s own mass equation, momentum
equation, and energy equation were adopted to achieve numerical simulation.27 On the basis of the size of absorber, the physical
model (Figure 2), meshing,
and calculation domain were determined.

Figure 2 Physical model of numerical
simulation.

For the mathematical
models, Euler-mixed model was selected to
study the bubble flow field characteristics, and the volume of fluid
mixed model was utilized to study the change of SO2 concentration
accompanied by the chemical reaction.28−30 Further, the pre-exponential
factor, activation energy, and reaction rate constant were determined
by kinetic experimental solving.

The main physical and chemical
parameters are shown in Table 1.

In this way, the intrinsic

the desulfurization of aluminum base was established. This method
provided the possibility of microscopic simulation of the desulfurization
characteristics under bubbling conditions.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Effect of Aluminum Base
Absorption Solution
Temperature on ηabs
In order to investigate
the effect of temperature on ηabs, SO2 absorption experiments at different temperatures were carried out
under the conditions of absorption solution concentration of 50%,
inlet SO2 concentration of 5000 ppm, and aeration rate
of 0.1 m/s. Figure 3 shows the effect of absorption solution temperature on ηabs.

Figure 3 Effect of absorption solution temperature on ηabs. Absorption solution concentration, 50%; inlet SO2 concentration,
5000 ppm; and aeration rate, 0.1 m/s.

The temperature of absorption solution had a significant
effect
on ηabs. Under different temperature conditions,
ηabs showed different time-varying characteristics.
When the absorption temperature was reduced from 323 to 293 K, ηabs rapidly increased from 87.2 to 91.8% in the initial absorption
time (20 min). In addition, the time point at which ηabs began to decrease dramatically varied with the absorption temperature.
In the experimental time range, ηabs under 293 K
decreased slowly and remained at a higher level (91.8–90.2%).
At 308 K, ηabs decreased rapidly from 87.5 to 76%
with the absorption time from 180 to 260 min. However, at 323 K, ηabs showed a rapid downward trend from the initial absorption
time and decreased from 87.2 to 53.8% in 180 min. The reasons could
be given as follows: high temperature reduced the SO2 solubility
and also provided temperature conditions for the SO2 desorption
of aluminum base absorption solution, which in turn had a negative
impact on ηabs. The cumulative effect of SO2 escape caused by the combination of temperature level and time determined
the variation of ηabs under different temperature
conditions. Hence, a low temperature was advantageous for the SO2 absorption performance of aluminum base.

3.2 Effect of Aluminum Base Absorption Solution
Concentration on ηabs
At an absorption solution
temperature of 293 K, both the simulated flue gas SO2 concentration
of 5000 ppm and aeration rate of 0.1 m/s were selected for experiments. Figure 4 shows the effect
of absorption solution concentration on ηabs.

Figure 4 Effect of absorption
solution concentration on ηabs. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration,
5000 ppm; and aeration rate, 0.1 m/s.

When the concentration of aluminum base absorption solution
changed
from 25 to 100%, the ηabs range was from 78.9 to
93.7%. Under the same desulfurization time, ηabc increased
with the increase of aluminum base concentration but showed different
time variation characteristics at different aluminum base concentrations.

The experiment showed that ηabs remained at a
high level of more than 90% at aluminum base concentration higher
than 50%. ηabs maintained stability at approximately
91% and decreased slowly from 91.1 to 90.2% after 260 min at an aluminum
base concentration of 50%. When aluminum base concentration was 100%,
ηabs remained stable at approximately 93% and decreased
slowly from 93.5 to 92.9% after 300 min. By contrast, the overall
ηabs level was low at aluminum base concentration
less than 50%, and ηabs was less than 86.4% at an
aluminum base concentration of 25%. At the same time, ηabs decreased slowly from 85.9 to 84.2% at the interval of
120–260 min and then declined rapidly to 78.9%. This result
was related to the low concentration of active Al2O3 in the low concentration of aluminum base absorbing solution.

3.3 Effect of Inlet SO2 Concentration
on ηabs
The emission range of SO2 was 0–5000 ppm in coal-fired power plant and 15 000–80 000
ppm in smelting flue gas. Meanwhile, the higher concentration might
make the difference of mass-transfer characteristics and ηabs more significant. We selected the inlet SO2 concentration
of 2000, 5000, and 50 000 ppm as the desulfurization object.
Then, aluminum base desulfurization experiments were performed with
the absorption solution temperature of 293 K, aluminum base concentration
of 50%, and aeration rate of 0.1 m/s.

Figure 5 shows the effect of inlet SO2 concentration on ηabs.

Figure 5 Effect of inlet SO2 concentration on ηabs. T, 293 K; absorption solution concentration, 50%;
and aeration rate, 0.1 m/s.

When the inlet SO2 concentration changed from
2000 to
50 000 ppm, the overall ηabs remained at a
high level over 90%. Meanwhile, ηabs increased with
the increase of aluminum base concentration under the same desulfurization
time. However, ηabs showed different time variation
characteristics at different inlet SO2 concentrations.
Experiments showed that ηabs was relatively low under
the low inlet SO2 concentration of 2000–5000 ppm.
When the concentration was 2000 and 5000 ppm, ηabs was stable at approximately 90 and 91%, respectively. However, ηabs decreased slowly from 91.1 to 90.2% after 260 min under
the inlet SO2 concentration of 5000 ppm. From the analysis
above, the chemical reaction rate determined the ηabs level, and the gas-phase mass-transfer resistance was the main factor
restricting the ηabs increase under this low SO2 concentration condition. Under the condition of high inlet
SO2 concentration of 50 000 ppm, the increase of
reaction rate and SO2 gas-phase mass-transfer power led
to a high ηabs level of 94.9% in the initial stage
(within 140 min) but accelerated the consumption of active Al2O3 in aluminum base absorption solution. Thus,
ηabs decreased slowly from 94.7 to 93.6% at the interval
of 140–280 min and then declined rapidly to 91.1%. As a result,
the chemical reaction rate and gas-phase mass-transfer resistance
together determine the ηabs level under this high
SO2 concentration condition.

In general, higher SO2 concentration was beneficial
to enhance gas-phase mass-transfer capacity and increase reaction
rate. Considering the objectivity of SO2 emission concentration
of coal-fired flue gas under different industrial conditions, strengthening
the gas–liquid mass transfer by physical methods was one of
the main ways to effectively improve the ηabs of
bubbling desulfurization.

3.4 Effect of Aeration Rate
on ηabs
Under the condition of absorption
solution temperature
of 293 K, the experiment was conducted at a simulated flue gas SO2 concentration of 5000 ppm and an aluminum base absorption
solution concentration of 50%. Figure 6 shows the effect of absorber inlet aeration rate on
ηabs.

Figure 6 Effect of aeration rate on ηabs. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration, 5000 ppm;
and absorption
solution concentration, 50%.

When the aeration rate was changed from 0.05 to 0.15 m/s,
the ηabs range was from 89.7 to 93.2%. At the same
desulfurization
time, ηabs increased with the aeration rate. For
each aeration rate, a stable segment and different maintenance times
for high ηabs were observed. The experiments showed
that ηabs remained stable by approximately 90% at
the aeration rate of 0.05 m/s. However, ηabs decreased
slowly from 91.1 to 90.2% after 260 min at the aeration rate of 0.1
m/s. Moreover, ηabs decreased slowly from 93 to 92.6%
at the interval of 120–220 min at the aeration rate of 0.15
m/s and then declined rapidly to 90.6%.

These results above
might be related to the high aeration rate
reducing the stagnation time of bubbles in liquid phase. Moreover,
higher aeration rate might enhance the gas–liquid mass transfer,
but it would consume more absorbents, resulting in shorter time with
high ηabs level. Therefore, under the same reactant
concentration conditions, the hydrodynamic field characteristics had
an important influence on ηabs.

3.5 Numerical Simulation Microscopic Analysis
of Alumina Base Desulfurization
The bubble aluminum base
desulfurization was completed gradually as the bubbles diffuse in
the height direction. Observation of the bubble formation, diffusion,
and SO2 concentration changes in the height direction of
the absorber showed that the gas–liquid absorption mass-transfer
characteristics accompanied by chemical reactions could be comprehensively
analyzed and judged from the microscopic level.

Given that the
high inlet SO2 concentration and low aluminum base concentration
could quickly and clearly reflect the ηabs changes,
we selected the inlet SO2 concentration of 50 000
ppm as the desulfurization object. Then, aluminum base desulfurization
experiment was simulated at the temperature of 293 K, absorption solution
concentration of 25%, and aeration rates of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 m/s.
Through this method, the microscopic law of desulfurization chemical
mass transfer could be revealed.

3.5.1 Effect of Bubble Formation
and Diffusion
on Chemical Mass Transfer
Figure 7 shows the initial bubble size at different
aeration rates. With the increase of aeration rate, the formation
of the initial bubble decreased first and then increased.

Figure 7 Effect of aeration
rate on bubble size. T, 293
K; inlet SO2 concentration, 50 000 ppm; absorption
solution concentration, 25%; and aeration rate: (a) 0.05, (b) 0.1,
(c) 0.15, (d) 0.2 m/s.

Small aeration rate resulted in larger initial bubble and
greater
buoyancy than the bubble gravity and viscous force of the orifice.
At this time, the effect of bubble orifice separation was mainly controlled
by viscous force of the orifice. As the aeration rate increased, the
initial bubble diameter became small, causing a decrease in buoyancy
and orifice viscous force. At this point, the thrust generated by
the aeration rate became the driving force for bubble diffusion, and
the effect of bubble orifice separation was mainly controlled by the
aeration rate. The large aeration volume increased the bubble diameter
again when the aeration rate increases to a certain critical value
(0.15 m/s). At this time, the effect of bubble orifice separation
was controlled together by the aeration rate and viscous force of
the orifice. The result above was consistent with the study of Dou.31

Figures 8 and 9 show the rising and diffusing
states of the initial
bubble every 2 s at the aeration rate of 0.05 m/s.

Figure 8 Bubble rising and diffusing
state in simulated desulfurization
process. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration,
50 000 ppm; absorption solution concentration, 25%; and aeration
rate, 0.05 m/s.

Figure 9 Bubble rising and diffusing
state in experimental desulfurization
process. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration,
50 000 ppm; absorption solution concentration, 25%; and aeration
rate, 0.05 m/s.

The rising and diffusing
of bubbles were affected by static pressure,
buoyancy, surface tension, fluid turbulence, and shearing force. Thus,
the bubble underwent multiple coalescence and breakage, and its size
and morphology changed irregularly. Meanwhile, the bubble breaks when
subjected to an external force greater than the surface tension. During
bubble collision, the liquid in the liquid film flowed out to make
the liquid film thin and fused under the combined effect of surface
tension and siphon action.32,33

On the one hand,
the bubble diffused axially along the height direction
under the action of velocity. On the other hand, a horizontal velocity
was generated, and the radial diffusion zone of bubbles began to form
at a certain height under the combined action of liquid hydrostatic
pressure, hydrodynamic pressure, and shear stress. This condition
promoted the degree of mixing in the gas–liquid phase and provided
physical mass-transfer power for the full SO2 reaction
with the aluminum base. Under this experimental system, the bubbles
evolved in the height direction of the absorber in the form of a single
gas column (about 1/4 height at the bottom) to the crushing and mixing,
and then the large bubble (about 1/4 height in the upper part).

Furthermore, the effect of aluminum base desulfurization with a
chemical reaction not only depended on the physical mass transfer
but also on the absorption reaction of SO2. This phenomenon
could be explained by the microscopic process of SO2 absorption
in bubbles.

Figure 10 shows
both the bubble coalescence and SO2 concentration distribution
in the aluminum base absorption solution. Combined with the analysis
of two-film theory, we could see that the SO2 gradually
diffused from the gas phase to the liquid phase, thereby forming a
stable gas–liquid boundary film. The chemical reaction of aluminum
base desulfurization mainly occurred in the gas–liquid boundary
film. This result was related to the fast desulfurization reaction
of the aluminum base.

Figure 10 Bubble coalescence and SO2 concentration distribution
in absorption solution. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration, 50 000 ppm; absorption solution concentration,
25%; and aeration rate, 0.05 m/s.

The distribution of SO2 partial pressure (or concentration)
in the gas film determined the difference in mass-transfer resistance.
During the entire chemical mass transfer, SO2 diffused
from the gas phase through the gas–liquid boundary film into
the liquid phase by molecular diffusion and then formed a certain
concentration gradient. At a stable reaction, no mass-transfer resistance
was observed at the phase interface, or the gas–liquid phase
reached the concentration balance. In the gas–liquid phase
main body outside the stagnant film, given that the gas–liquid
phase could not directly contact and mass transfer, no concentration
gradient was observed. The material composition was also uniform and
stable. The above conclusion was consistent with the previous research
of the author.27

Overall, the performance
of bubble aluminum base desulfurization
was influenced by both the chemical reaction rate and the gas-phase
mass-transfer capacity. Therefore, increasing the number of small
bubbles while promoting the disturbance of the flow field to improve
the mass-transfer driving force could increase the gas–liquid
contact area of the chemical reaction and improve ηabs.

3.5.2 Microscopic Process of Aluminum Base Desulfurization
The microscopic process of aluminum base desulfurization performance
could be obtained by analyzing the SO2 average concentration
in the absorber height direction. At different aeration rate conditions,
ηabs at the outlet of the absorber was selected at
a certain point in the stable stage. This factor served as the basis
for the simulation results and experimental comparison. Figures 11 and 12 show the comparison of the simulated values of
SO2 average concentration and ηabs along
the absorber height with the experimental values at the time of 6
min.

Figure 11 Change of SO2 average concentration along the absorber
height. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration,
50 000 ppm; absorption solution concentration, 25%; and time,
6 min.

Figure 12 Change of ηabs along
the absorber height. T, 293 K; inlet SO2 concentration, 50 000
ppm; absorption solution concentration, 25%; and time, 6 min.

At the aeration rates of 0.05,
0.1, and 0.15 m/s, the simulated
value of ηabs at the outlet of the absorber had a
good agreement with the experimental value, and the relative errors
were −2.54, −4.02, and −2.90%, respectively.

The interval of 0–0.1 m in height was the initial stage
of bubble formation and aluminum base desulfurization. At this stage,
the initial bubbles entering the liquid phase were more concentrated,
and the effective contact surface with absorption solution was small.
Meanwhile, the large liquid pressure hindered the bubble diffusion
in the gas phase. This condition resulted in the inability of gas–liquid
interaction to proceed rapidly. Thus, the SO2 average concentration
in gas phase was high, and ηabs was only 15% or less.

The interval of 0.1–0.34 m in height was the main stage
for bubble diffusion and aluminum base desulfurization. At this stage,
a large number of bubbles of different sizes continuously rose and
diffused. On the one hand, the reduction of the mixing pressure of
the gas–liquid phase decreased the mass-transfer resistance
at the phase interface. Meanwhile, the increase of effective contact
area promoted the chemical mass transfer. At this time, the SO2 average concentration decreased rapidly with height, and
ηabs corresponding to the aeration rates of 0.05,
0.1, and 0.15 m/s increased rapidly to 84.8, 86.4, and 85.9%, respectively.

The interval of 0.34–0.4 m in height was the stable stage
for aluminum base desulfurization. At this stage, the number of bubbles
was small, the size was large, and the SO2 concentration
in bubbles was low. This phenomenon decreased the gas–liquid
mass-transfer capacity and the chemical reaction rate. At this time,
the SO2 average concentration gradually decreased to a
low level. In addition, ηabs corresponding to the
aeration rates 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 m/s slowly increased to 89.8, 92.5,
and 92.2%, respectively.

4 Conclusions
The characteristics for aluminum base FGD were comprehensively
examined by combining bubbling SO2 absorption experiments
and numerical simulations under various factors. The results showed
that the desulfurization performance was affected by both the chemical
reaction rate and gas-phase mass-transfer capacity. The temperature
of absorption solution had a significant effect on ηabs, and low temperature was advantageous for SO2 absorption
performance of aluminum base. Effectively increasing the number of
small bubbles could promote the disturbance of the flow field to improve
the mass-transfer driving force. At the same time, the gas–liquid
contact area of the chemical reaction was increased and promoted the
ηabs increase. During desulfurization, three stages
exist, namely, the initial desulfurization zone with bubble formation
(ηabs was low), the core desulfurization zone with
bubble diffusion (ηabs increased rapidly), and the
stable desulfurization zone (ηabs was high and stable).
The effect of absorption temperature on desulfurization performance
was that ηabs decreased with the rise of temperature
under the same desulfurization time. The stabilization time of high
ηabs was markedly shortened with the increase of
absorption temperature from 293 to 323 K; especially at 323 K, the
ηabs decreased rapidly from 87.2% at the beginning
to 53.8% within 180 min. The effect of absorption solution concentration
on desulfurization performance was that ηabs increased
with the increase of aluminum base concentration under the same desulfurization
time. When the concentration range of aluminum base was greater than
50%, ηabs remained above 90%. Meanwhile, the overall
level of ηabs was low when the concentration range
was less than 50%. The effect of inlet SO2 concentration
on desulfurization performance was that ηabs increased
with the increase of inlet SO2 concentration under the
same desulfurization time. Under the conditions of aluminum base concentration
of 50% and inlet SO2 concentration higher than 2000 ppm,
ηabs was above 90%. Although high inlet SO2 concentration was beneficial to increase ηabs,
it also shortened the ηabs maintenance time. The
effect of aeration rate on desulfurization performance was that ηabs increased with the aeration rate under the same desulfurization
time. The aeration rate affected not only the size formation and diffusion
state of bubbles in liquid phase but also the effective gas–liquid
contact time and aluminum base consumption rate in the finite absorber.
Therefore, an optimal aeration rate was observed for a given desulfurization
system.
