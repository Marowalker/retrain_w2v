By targeting CD44 receptors, inhibiting
multidrug resistance (MDR),
controlling drug release, and synergistically inhibiting tumor growth,
a multilayered nanosystem was developed to serve as a multifunctional
platform for the treatment of drug-resistant breast cancers. The multilayer
nanosystem is composed of a poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid) core, a liposome second layer, and a chitosan third layer. The
chitosan-multilayered nanoparticles (Ch-MLNPs) can co-deliver three
chemotherapeutic agents: doxorubicin (DOX), paclitaxel (PTX), and
silybin. The three drugs are released from the multilayered NPs in
a controlled and sequential manner upon internalization and localization
in the cellular endosomes. The presence of a chitosan layer allows
the nanosystem to target a well-characterized MDR breast cancer biomarker,
the CD44s receptor. In vitro cytotoxicity study showed that the nanosystem
loaded with triple drugs, DOX–PTX–silybin, resulted
in better antitumor efficacy than the single-drug or dual-drug nano-formulations.
Likely attributed to the MDR-inhibition effect of silybin, the co-delivered
DOX and PTX exhibited a better synergistic effect on MDR breast cancer
cells than on non-MDR breast cancer cells. The in vivo study also
showed that the multilayered nanosystem promoted MDR inhibition and
synergy between chemotherapeutic agents, leading to significant tumor
reduction in a xenograft animal model. Ch-MLNPs reduced the tumor
volume by fivefold compared to that of the control group without causing
overt cytotoxicity.

1 Introduction
In cancer therapy, the
efficiency of delivering anticancer drugs
to tumor sites via nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial. Much effort has
been devoted to optimize NP delivery systems, and so far many systems
have aimed to effectively deliver and release a single drug to treat
various tumors.1−8 However, single-drug systems are often inadequate in treating drug-resistant
cancers.9−14

The key for using NP-mediated drug delivery systems to effectively
inhibit cancer progression is to target multiple cancer pathways.15,16 However, simultaneously delivering multiple drugs and inhibitors
to target tumor sites and controlling the release of loaded chemotherapeutic
drugs according to their unique mechanisms of action have remained
a challenge.17 Although traditional nanodelivery
systems have been reported to be able to carry two drugs (or small
interfering RNA),18−20 studies on multi-agent-based cancer therapy, in which
multiple mechanisms of action and synergistic inhibitions can be achieved,
have been scarce. Ideally, an effective multi-agent-based cancer therapy
should have a first agent that can sensitize the cancer cells and
a second agent that would take advantage of the vulnerable state of
cancer cells to enhance their cytotoxic efficacy.15 In recent years, polymeric NPs, which are capable of delivering
chemosensitizing agents to block the activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) for multidrug resistance
(MDR) in cancer cells, have attracted increased research interest.21−24 Flavonoids, which are a class of pigments found in almost all plants
and their products,25 have shown strong
inhibition of P-gp-mediated and BCRP-mediated efflux and thus can
increase the cellular accumulation of P-gp and BCRP substrates and
restore the sensitivity of MDR cells.26−29 Previous studies have demonstrated
that some flavonoids can be used alone to inhibit P-gp and reverse
BCRP-mediated MDR even at very low concentrations (∼50 μM).30

In this study, a new multilayered and
multifunctional nanosystem,
chitosan–liposome–poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid) (PLGA) NPs, was fabricated for efficient MDR inhibition, simultaneous
delivery of multiple drugs, and controlled drug release for cancer
therapy (Figure 1).
The inclusion of the chitosan layer was based on the hypothesis that
it could aid in tumor targeting.1 The chitosan
layer also provides a dynamic “cloud” to render the
nanosystem “stealth,” repelling plasma proteins and
avoiding capture by macrophages.31−34 Thus, the chitosan layer can
prolong the half-life of the NPs in blood, reduce allergic reactions
and rejection by immune clearance, and target cancer cells through
selective binding to the CD44 receptors. The unique multilayered structure
enables the loading of three chemotherapeutic agents into different
layers to achieve controlled and sequential release. Silybin, a flavonoid
that was encapsulated in the chitosan layer, can act as an MDR inhibitor
by inhibiting the “drug-pumping” effect mediated by
the P-gp pump.35 Paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin
(DOX) were respectively loaded into the liposome and PLGA layer of
the NPs, and they could act synergistically36 to kill cancer cells by taking advantage of the vulnerable state
of cancer cells caused by silybin.

NPs and their

the transport of Ch-MLNPs in targeting tumors via: (C) EPR effect
and (D) selective binding of Ch-MLNPs to CD44 receptors overexpressed
on cancer cells. (E) The three loaded drugs (silybin, PTX, and DOX)
are released at different time points and act on different targets
in the cancer cell. Silybin is released first, followed by PTX, and
finally DOX. This time-staggered effect is ideal for maximal efficacy
of drug therapy. Inhibition of the MDR effect will maximize the effective
drug content in cancer cells, and DOX can induce substantial DNA damage
after PTX has sensitized the cancer cells.

2 Results and Discussion
Chitosan-multi-layered
NPs (Ch-MLNPs), consisting of three layers,
were fabricated by first forming PLGA NPs, followed by assembling
a double layer of lipids37 and then a layer
of chitosan.38 DOX was encapsulated in
PLGA through a double emulsion method. The DOX-loaded PLGA NPs were
then encapsulated in 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DSPC) liposomes, in which PTX was loaded via hydrophobic interactions
between the drug and the hydrophobic tails of lipids. The resultant
particles (liposome–PLGA) were then coated with a silybin-loaded
chitosan layer. The structure of drug-loaded multilayered NPs was
verified by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The particle
size and surface charge of the NPs gradually changed during the fabrication
process. The NPs had a final ζ potential of 7.56 ± 0.54
mV and a diameter of 223 ± 73 nm (Figure 2A), which are favorable for the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect.39−42 TEM images (Figure 2B(a–c), right panels)
confirmed the structure of the PLGA core, the liposome layer, and
the outermost chitosan shell, respectively. The presence of the liposome
and chitosan layers on the PLGA NPs was evident based on the increase
in NP size with the low polydispersity index (PDI) after the addition
of each layer (Figure 2B(a–c), left panels). As shown in Figure 2C, Ch-MLNPs were more stable in 0.01 M pH
7.4 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) than in 10% human serum. From
the CLSM analyses (Figure 3A), co-localization of the three fluorescent colors [red from
DOX-labeled PLGA, green from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) (NBD)-labeled liposome,
and blue from Alexa Fluor 350-labeled chitosan] also confirmed the
formation of a multilayered nanostructure. Figure 3B shows the zoomed-in confocal images, which
clearly show that the three layers were assembled together to form
Ch-MLNPs.

The loading of DOX into PLGA was
analyzed by a fluorescence-based
assay with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm,43 whereas PTX and silybin loading were quantified
using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) monitored at 227
and 280 nm,44,45 respectively. The multilayered
NPs could load approximately 75 ± 10 μg/mg of DOX, 120
± 12 μg/mg of PTX, and 90 ± 12 μg/mg of silybin.
A drug-loading ratio of 3:5 (DOX/PTX) was selected according to our
previous study18 and published data on
the synergistic effect between DOX and PTX.46 The drug release profiles were determined by a dialysis method as
reported elsewhere without the presence of serum.47 According to the drug release profiles (Figure 4A), the MDR inhibitor, silybin,
which was localized in the outermost layer, was released first, followed
by PTX from the liposome layer and DOX from the PLGA core. Similarly,
the line fittings and calculated EC50 also show the release tendency
of each individual drug, with silybin released first, followed by
PTX, and subsequently DOX. In contrast, the release profiles of DOX
and PTX from control particles in which both drugs were loaded into
the PLGA core, which was coated by drug-free liposome and chitosan
layers, were almost identical (Figure 4B). The similar EC50 values of PTX and DOX,
which were loaded in the same layer, also indicate there is no significant
difference between the two release profiles. Compared with the reported
drug release profiles from PLGA particles,48−50 the release
of drugs enclosed in the PLGA core of the multilayered NPs was delayed
by more than 10 h, revealing the effect of the liposome and chitosan
layers.

parameters evaluated from the slope and intercept of the three-parameter
line fitting. (A) Drug release profiles of silybin, PTX, and DOX.
(B) Drug release profiles of PTX and DOX, which were both loaded in
the PLGA core of Ch-MLNPs. The EC50 is the concentration
that gives a response half way between the bottom and top plateaus
of the curve.

For the three-layered
NPs with DOX loaded, at 3 h, Ch-MLNPs were
concentrated around the cell nuclei and a substantial amount of the
multilayered NPs have been internalized into the cells (Figure 5A—3 h panel). Co-localization
of the red (DOX) and green (NPs) fluorescence in cells indicated that
the integrity of the multilayered NPs was still intact in the intracellular
environment. After 3 h, indicated by the increased fluorescence intensity,
more NPs were observed to accumulate in the cells as the incubation
time increased. The NPs began to release DOX at 5 h post-incubation
(5 h, DOX image), although the orange color in the merged image indicated
that DOX had yet entered the cell nuclei (5 h, merged image).
At 6 h, DOX was released from the NPs (6 h, DOX image) and began to
enter the cell nuclei, as indicated by the arrows in the images. However,
the boundary of nuclei is still not sharp, as shown in the enlarged
image, indicating that a large proportion of the released DOX had
not entered the cell nuclei. At 24 h post-incubation, the purple color
(24 h, merged image) indicates that DOX had mostly been released from
the NPs and entered the nuclei. The sharp nuclei boundary in the enlarged
image shows distinctively that most of the loaded DOX had entered
the cell nuclei.

of Ch-MLNPs

and liposomes were labeled with NBD (green). DOX, loaded in the
core, is self-fluorescent (red). Arrows point to the intracellular
tracking of NPs and loaded drugs at different culture times. (B) The
intracellular distribution of Ch-MLNPs and PLGA in cancer cells (MDA-MB-231)
after incubation for 3 h. Scale bar represents 10 μm.

Interestingly, in addition to
their high capability to target overexpressed
CD44 receptors on cancer cells, the multilayered NPs were also found
to concentrate around the nuclei of cancer cells. This suggests that
the multilayered NPs appear to accumulate around nuclei (Figure 5—3 h panel),
agreeing with previously published results.51,52 Meanwhile, the PLGA-only NPs, which served as a control, did not
show any concentrated color around the nuclei as compared to the multilayered
NPs (Figure 5A−B).

The in vitro antitumor efficacy of the chitosan- and non-chitosan
NPs on MDR- and non-MDR cancer cells were compared (Figure 6). In the MDR cancer cells
(Figure 6A), chitosan-coated
NPs showed improved binding capacity over NPs without chitosan, as
seen by the higher fluorescence intensity in Ch-MLNP-treated cells
after 2 h of exposing the cells to respective NPs. Although the fluorescence
intensity increased with culture time for both types of NPs, chitosan-coated
NPs showed significantly improved binding capacity after 1 h. The p value increased with longer cultured time. On the other
hand, for the non-MDR cancer cells (Figure 6B), chitosan-coated NPs did not show significantly
improved binding capacity. The endocytosis mediated by the chitosan–CD44
interactions was the main mechanism for the uptake of chitosan-coated
nanosystem.1 Although to date, there is
no report of higher binding capacity on MDR cells than on non-MDR
cells for chitosan materials, this study proves the significant difference
in binding capacity between chitosan-coated NPs and MDR and non-MDR
cancer cells. Given the fact that the tested non-MDR cancer cell,
A549,53 does not express CD44s as the surface
marker,54 this observation suggests that
the chitosan–CD44s interaction might be the main reason for
the selective uptake. This mechanism was also supported by the conclusions
of previous reports,55,56 which showed CD44v was not present
on MDR cancer cells, and the physical and genetic interaction between
CD44s and P-gp is in part responsible for the MDR in cancer cells.
This further indicates that CD44s might be the targeted binding protein
for chitosan.

(B) A-549
(non-MDR cancer cells) cells through flow cytometry after being exposed
to different NP structures for various amount of time.

The in vitro antitumor efficacy of different drug
formulations
was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay in MDA-MB-231 and A-549 cancer cells. The viability
of cancer cells treated with various doses (sum of all of the drugs)
of drug formulations is shown in Figure 7A. As a P-gp pump inhibitor, silybin-loaded
Ch-MLNPs (without DOX and PTX) showed little anticancer capacity,
which agrees with the reported anticancer growth inhibitory effects
of silybin.57 In order to investigate the
impacts of drug concentration on cell viability, the regulatory impact
analysis (RIA) was used, which could provide a detailed and systematic
appraisal of the potential impacts of drug concentration on cell viability.58 The results (Figure 7B) indicate the drug-loaded Ch-MLNPs had
a better anticancer capacity on MDR cancer cells than on non-MDR cancer
cells. Moreover, the triple-drug-loaded nanosystem performed better
than the double-drug-loaded nanosystem (without silybin) on MDR cancer
cells, likely because of the activity of silybin on blocking P-gp.
The cytotoxicity efficacy of different formulations on MDR- and non-MDR
cancer cells was compared (Figure 7C). For both cancer cells, the triple-drug-loaded and
double-drug-loaded MLNPs had a better IC50 than DOX- or
PTX-loaded MLNPs, especially on MDR cancer cells, demonstrating the
benefit of the synergistic effect of these two or three drugs in the
nano-formulations.

cancer cells and A-549 lung cancer cells. (A) Cell viability of MDA-MB-231
and A-549 cells after being exposed to various doses of different
drug formulations. (B) RIA of cell percent survival under various
doses of different drugs. (C,D) IC50 (half maximal inhibitory

Ch-MLNPs when exposed to MDA-MB-231 and A-549 cells. Comparison among
groups was conducted by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD
analysis, *p < 0.05, **p <
0.01, ***p < 0.001.

In order to study the synergistic effect among different
drugs,
combination indices (CI50) were calculated.59 CI50, defined by the following equation,
compares the required concentrations of multiple compounds administered
in combination to that of a single agent compound required to give
the same fractional effect. The modified CI50 equation
is  

The equation calculates CI50 by adding the responses
of the number of compounds administered and taking into consideration
the ratio at which these more compounds are administered. When CI50 = 1, the effects of drugs are additive; when CI50 < 1, the combination is synergistic; when CI50 >
1,
the combination is antagonistic.

As shown in Figure 7D, DOX–PTX–silybin
MLNPs resulted in a better synergistic
effect than DOX–PTX MLNPs on MDR cancer cells, as they had
a significantly lower CI50. Interestingly, the differences
on the non-MDR cancer cells were not significant (p > 0.05). This discrepancy may be attributed to the MDR inhibition
property of silybin, which can increase the anticancer efficiency
of chemotherapeutic agents, DOX and PTX. For DOX–PTX–silybin
MLNPs, there is no significant difference between MDR and non-MDR
cancer cells, which indicates that the synergistic effect between
DOX and PTX might be large enough to overshadow the effect between
(DOX–PTX) and silybin.60 Because
the difference of DOX–PTX–silybin MLNPs between MDR
and non-MDR is insignificant, the role of silybin in the synergistic
effect was further studied by considering the DOX–PTX as one
drug. The synergistic effect between silybin and (DOX–PTX)
was identified by the IC50 of silybin MLNPs and DOX–PTX
MLNPs (Figure 7E,F).
Unlike the synergistic effect among the three drugs together, the
role of silybin between MDR- and non-MDR cancer cells was significant.
This significant difference suggested that the P-gp blocking property
of silybin was applicable only to MDR cancer cells, rather than to
the non-MDR cancer cells.

To evaluate the antitumor efficacy
of the multilayered NPs in vivo,
female BALB/c nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft tumors of MDA-MB-231
cells received intravenous administration of Ch-MLNPs. The controls
included NPs loaded with DOX, with DOX and PTX, with PBS, and with
empty particles without any drugs. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
was first evaluated in a dose escalation study in healthy female NCI
nu/nu mice (6–8 weeks of age) through tail vein injection of
0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg of DOX encapsulated in multilayered NPs
using a q4d × 4 regimen (once every four days for four doses
with PBS as control). Results of survival study and body weight changes
indicated that a dose of 2.0 mg/kg reduced mice weight by 15% and
death ensued one day after the fourth dose. The MTD for all groups
was determined to be 1.5 mg/kg of DOX under the 4 day dosing regimen.
In the following in vivo efficacy test, mice were treated with DOX
at the MTD through tail vein injection using a q4d × 4 regimen,
and tumor volumes were monitored every 3 days. At the end point of
the study (35th day), significant tumor regression was seen in the
treatment group. The multilayered NPs (with three drugs) reduced the
average tumor volume by 1.43- (n = 3, p = 0.07), 2.21- (n = 3, p <
0.01), 4.49-, and 5.115-fold (n = 3, p < 0.001) compared to the Ch-MLNP double-drug control, Ch-MLNP
single-drug control, drug-free control, and PBS control, respectively
(Figure 8A). Figure 8B shows the tumor
shrinkage in the group treated with multilayered NPs in comparison
with the group treated with PBS. In the particles-only treatment group,
there is a small shrinking effect compared with the PBS controls,
but it is not significantly different. This finding is in agreement
with previous reports.1 On the other hand,
the statistical analysis shows an insignificant difference (p = 0.1363) of tumor shrinkage between DOX–PTX-loaded
MLNPs (147.58 ± 40.62 mm3) and DOX–PTX–silybin-loaded
MLNPs (103.40 ± 6.50 mm3), but it is worth pointing
out that the animal number is small in this study (n = 3). Nevertheless, an improved tumor shrinkage trend is still evident.
There would be a significant difference in tumor shrinkage if N was increased to 8, but this was not feasible because
of the constraints of this experiment. The results of mouse body weight
change are shown in Figure 9A. No significant differences were found between the treatment
group and the PBS control group. In addition, the histopathological
analyses of mouse tissues collected at the end of the study (Figure 9B) show that treatment
with Ch-MLNPs did not cause significant tissue damage, suggesting
that Ch-MLNPs were not toxic at the MTD.

formulations at MTDs in xenograft tumors.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a three-layered
nano-platform was developed that
is capable of delivering multiple drugs. The nano-platform had a size
of around 200 nm, which is relatively optimal for the EPR effects.
Multiple drugs can be readily loaded and successfully delivered to
tumors to counter the MDR effect. The nano-platform takes advantage
of the interaction between chitosan and CD44s receptors, delayed drug
release, and the synergistic effect among loaded drugs. Furthermore,
the synergistic effects between the three loaded drugs were investigated
on both MDR and non-MDR cancer cells through a modified CI50 model. Compared with the non-silybin formulation (DOX + PTX only),
the silybin-loaded NPs (DOX + PTX + silybin) showed a significantly
better result of P-gp blocking on MDR cancer cells, which enables
an improved anti-tumor efficacy in vivo. This work demonstrated the
potential of NPs as combination multi-therapeutic platforms for enhanced
efficacy against drug-resistant breast cancer. With the unique transport
process after cell uptake, it is possible to design NPs tailored for
treating specific cancer patients with better clinical outcomes.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
PLGA
(Lactel 50:50, mol.
weight 30 000–60 000) was purchased from Durect
Corporation (Cupertino, CA). Chitosan (mol. weight 50 000–190 000)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). DOX and PTX were
ordered from LC Laboratories, Inc. (Woburn, MA, US). Coumarin-6,
fluorescein isothiocyanate, dichloromethane (DCM), polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA), and Nile red were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (Saint
Louis, MO). Ready-to-use dialysis tubes [molecular weight cut-off
(MWCO), 6000–8000] were purchased from Spectrum Laboratories,
Inc. (Rancho Dominguez, CA, US). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and Alexa Fluor 350 were obtained from Life Technologies Corporation
(Grand Island, NY, USA). Cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and A-549)
and related agents including trypsin/ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
solution, F-12K medium, L-15 medium, and fetal bovine serum were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA).
All of the other chemicals were of analytical grade.

4.2 Preparation of Ch-MLNPs
The protocol
for Ch-MLNPs preparation was developed based on a previously established
method.37,61 Briefly, PLGA was dissolved in DCM (20 mg/mL)
and DOX was dissolved in distilled water (5 mg/200 μL). The
DOX solution was then dropped into the PLGA solution and emulsified
by sonication using a sonic dismembrator (model 500; Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburg, PA, USA; operating frequency: 20 kHz) at 20% for 10 min.
The resultant emulsion was added into 10 mL solution of PVA and was
sonicated again at 70% for 90 s. Liposomes were formulated at a lipid
mass ratio of 80:10:10 [DSPC/cholesterol/nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)].
These three components together with PTX (5 mg) were mixed well in
chloroform and then desiccated to form a thin film through overnight
vacuum drying. Liposome–PLGA NPs were prepared using a film-hydration–sonication
method, as described previously.62 One
milliliter of 0.01 M pH 7.4 PBS was added to hydrate the lipid film.
Then, the suspension was sonicated for 5 min in a Branson M2800H ultrasonic
bath sonicator. Fifteen milligrams of PLGA NPs suspended in deionized
water (10 mg/mL) were added into the above liposome suspension. Subsequently,
in an ice–water bath, the mixture was sonicated using a bath
sonicator for 5 min. Liposome–PLGA NPs were collected by centrifugation
at 10 000g for 30 min. To prepare Ch-MLNPs,
2 mL liposome–PLGA was added dropwise to 30 mL chitosan solution
that contains 10 mg of silybin, and the mixture was allowed to stir
for 4 h.63,64 Ch-MLNPs were washed with PBS three times
and recovered by centrifugation at 7000g for 30 min.

4.3 Structural Characterization
Laser
Doppler electrophoresis measurements were performed using a Malvern
Nano-ZS Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK). The
stability property of prepared NPs was investigated by measuring the
change in NP size in 10% human serum (v/v) and 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4)
at room temperature under continuous stirring. The multilayered structure
of the NPs was characterized by TEM (JEOL JEM 1400 instrument, JEOL
Ltd., Japan) at a voltage of 120 kV and CLSM (Zeiss LSM 510 instrument,
Carl Zeiss, Germany). A zetasizer test was completed using samples
that were freshly prepared before use by dispersing the NPs in ultrapure
water. To image the NPs by negative TEM staining, the NPs were dissolved
in 0.01 M of pH 7.4 PBS buffer and were negatively stained according
to a standard procedure.65 Fluorescent
Ch-MLNPs were imaged by CLSM, in which the PLGA, liposome, and chitosan
layers were labeled by DOX (red), NBD (green), and Alexa Fluor 350
(blue), respectively.

4.4 Release Kinetics of Drugs
A dialysis
method was used to investigate in vitro release kinetics of drug-loaded
NPs. In brief, 20 mg of drug-loaded NPs was dissolved in PBS with
0.1% (v/v) Tween 80, and dialyzed against 20 mL of that same buffer
using ready-to-use dialysis tubes (MWCO 6000–8000) under continuous
stirring at 37 °C. At predetermined time points, 1 mL of the
sample solution was taken out and an equal 1 mL fresh buffer was added.
The concentrations of the drug were determined by measuring the fluorescence
intensity for DOX66 and HPLC for PTX67 and silybin.68

4.5 In Vitro Experiments
4.5.1 Cell
Culture
Triple negative breast
cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
Cells were subcultured in the supplier’s recommended basal
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL of penicillin,
and 50 units/mL of streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere. All experiments
were performed on cells cultured 12–24 h before experimentation.

4.5.2 Cellular Uptake and Intracellular Distribution
The protocols for cellular uptake and intracellular distribution
assays followed our previously published work.47,69 For the intracellular distribution study, MDA-MB-231 cells were
seeded onto a two-well chamber slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Pittsburgh, PA) at a concentration of 2 × 105/chamber
in 2 mL of medium and cultured overnight. The original medium was
replaced with fresh medium (2 mL) containing 20 μg of Ch-MLNPs.
Cells were incubated for 3, 5, 6, or 24 h. The nuclei of cells were
labeled by DAPI, a dihydrochloride. Cells were imaged by CLSM. For
the cellular uptake assays, the cells were seeded in a 12-well plate
at a density of 5000 cells/well and treated with 50 μg of fluorescently
labeled NPs for various periods of time at 37 °C, followed by
washing and treating with trypsin. The cell-associated fluorescence
was analyzed by a flow cytometer (BD FACSAria I, BD, Franklin Lakes,
NJ) coupled with a high-throughput system.

4.5.3 In
Vitro Cytotoxicity Assays
In
vitro cytotoxicity of Ch-MLNPs was evaluated using a MTT assay following
a protocol outlined elsewhere.18 Briefly,
cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/cell onto 96-well plates
and incubated for 24 h. After replacing the original media with fresh
media, cells were treated with different concentrations of drug formulations
and incubated for 72 h. After replacing the media with fresh media
containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL), cells were incubated for another 4 h at
37 °C. The media were then immediately removed, and 100 μL
of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to solubilize the formazan crystals.
Absorbance was measured at 570 nm through a Synergy HT Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Untreated
cells were used as control to calculate cell viability.

4.6 In Vivo Experiments
Female nude mice
(4–6 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River. All in vivo
experiments were carried out under the supervision of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Virginia Tech. The tumor
shrinkage efficacy of Ch-MLNPs was evaluated in a xenograft breast
cancer model. In brief, 5 × 107 cells/mL MDA-MB-231
cells (0.1 mL) (50:50 mixed with BD Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix)
were injected subcutaneously into the hind flanks of 8-week-old BALB/c
nude mice. Tumors were allowed to form for 2–3 weeks. When
the tumor reached a volume of 100 mm3, NP treatments were
performed by intravenously administering NPs at the MTD via tail vein.
Perpendicular tumor diameters were measured by digital caliper and
used to calculate tumor volume according to the reported protocol
every two days.70,71 Mice were sacrificed when the
tumors reached a volume of 600 mm3.

4.7 Statistical
Analysis
Data were expressed
as mean ± standard deviation. Among multiple groups, significance
tests were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) analysis. Differences
were considered as significant at p values < 0.05
(*), <0.01 (**), and <0.001 (***).
