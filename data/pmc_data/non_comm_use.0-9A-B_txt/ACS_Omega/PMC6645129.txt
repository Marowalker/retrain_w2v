The
K and Sr cations (K+ and Sr2+) in a Sr2KTa5O15 photocatalyst were found to
be easily substituted by Na cations (Na+) to form SrxKyNazTa5O15 by a facile one-pot
flux method using a mixture of potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium
chloride (NaCl). SrxKyNazTa5O15 fabricated using a mixture of KCl and NaCl with a Ag cocatalyst
showed enhanced photocatalytic activity without apparent change in
selectivity toward CO for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 using H2O. The present study demonstrates that
the flux treatment significantly affected the phase, morphology, band
gap, and surface Sr composition of the catalyst owing to the substitution
of K+ and Sr2+ for Na+. The stability
and durability of the catalyst were also enhanced as compared to those
of the photocatalyst fabricated using only KCl flux due to more stable Ag on the surface of SrxKyNazTa5O15.

1 Introduction
The
amount of CO2 produced from the oxidation of carbon
compounds has increased dramatically in recent decades owing to the
heavy use of fossil fuels to produce energy. The large amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from fuel combustion is considered
one of the main reasons for global warming.1,2 Therefore,
reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is
important. Considering CO2 as a potential source for carbon
feedstocks, fuels, and chemicals, many researchers have explored the
conversion of CO2 into other feedstocks and hydrocarbon
fuels, such as carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), formaldehyde
(HCHO), methanol (CH3OH), methane (CH4), ethylene
(CH2CH2), and ethanol (CH3CH2OH).3−5 However, substantial energy input is necessary to
convert CO2 into other carbon sources due to its thermodynamic
stability under natural conditions.

In this context, converting
CO2 into fuels and chemicals
using solar light as the energy source directly is one of the most
promising ways to achieve high-density storage of solar energy.6,7 Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into other carbon sources
by heterogeneous catalysts using H2O as an electron donor
is believed to be one of the best methods to mitigate CO2 emissions.8 Ensuring the conversion of
CO2 into carbon sources as the main products is important
because water splitting to form H2 and O2 is
thermodynamically more favorable than CO2 conversion when
using H2O as a reductant over heterogeneous photocatalysts.
However, only a few oxides, including BaLa4Ti4O15,9 ZnGa2O4/Ga2O3,10 ZnGa2O4,11 La2Ti2O7,12 CaTiO3,13 ZnTa2O6,14 and SrNb2O6,15,16 have been clearly demonstrated as suitable photocatalysts for the
stoichiometric production of CO, H2, and O2 from
the conversion of CO2 using H2O as an electron
donor.

Very recently, tetragonal tungsten bronze (TTB) materials,
such
as Sr2KTa5O15,17 KCaSrTa5O15,18,19 and K2RETa5O15 (RE = rare-earth
element)20 have been reported to show good
photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for CO evolution in the
conversion of CO2 using H2O as an electron donor. Figure 1 shows the typical
TTB structure along the [001] direction. The TTB structure is a derivative
of the classical perovskite structure and has three different types
of tunnels, i.e., pentagonal (A1), square (A2), and triangular tunnels.
Unlike the perovskite structure, which only has one type of square
tunnel, this unique property of the TTB structure facilitates a wide
variety of cation substitutions owing to the presence of several interstices.21 Alkali metal, alkaline-earth metal, and rare-earth
metal cations can easily occupy the 15 coordination sites of pentagonal
A1 tunnels and the 12 coordination sites of square A2 tunnels.22 These cations have been reported to have a strong
effect on CO2 adsorption and are believed to play important
roles during the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.23 Therefore, TTB-structured materials show excellent
potential for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the tetragonal tungsten bronze crystal
structure along the [001] direction.

In this work, we found that the K+ and Sr2+ in a Sr2KTa5O15 photocatalyst
could
be easily substituted by Na+ using a mixture of NaCl and
KCl as flux reactants. The effect of the substitution on the phase,
morphology, band gap, surface composition, and photocatalytic activity
for CO2 conversion were studied and discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
Table 1 shows the
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of all the catalysts fabricated
using different kinds of flux at 1173 K for 3 h. The K/Ta ratio of
the products decreases gradually with increasing molar ratio of NaCl
in the flux, and almost all the K element disappears when only NaCl
is used as flux. Conversely, the Na/Ta ratio increases with increasing
ratio of NaCl in the flux. Interestingly, the ratio of Sr/Ta decreases
by ∼25% when the mixed flux and NaCl flux are used, indicating
that the Sr content in the prepared catalysts decreases. Note that
the amount of SrCO3 precursor was the same for all fabrication
processes, suggesting that Sr species are changed to dissolvable species
and then dissolve into the solution during the washing process. We
propose reaction processes for SrCO3, K2CO3, and Ta2O5 during the flux treatment
as follows 1   2   3   4  At the beginning
of calcination, SrCO3 and K2CO3 are
decomposed to their oxides
(eqs 1 and 2);24 then, some of the SrO reacts
with NaCl to form Na2O and SrCl2 (eq 3), which then reacted further with
other oxides to form the product SrxKyNa5–2x–yTa5O15 (eq 4). ICP analysis of the solution used to wash
(KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst after the flux treatment
revealed that a large amount of Sr species was present in the solution.
However, this was not the case for (KCl)100(NaCl)0 (Table S1), confirming that Sr species
are not completely consumed in the mixture flux during the treatment
process.

We calculated the chemical
formulae for the as-fabricated catalysts
(Table 1). It is clearly
shown that substitution of K+ and Sr2+ for Na+ occurs to form SrxKyNazTa5O15. Many researchers have reported that larger cations prefer
to occupy A1 sites and smaller cations sit in A2 sites because A1
tunnels are larger than A2 tunnels.25−27 Using the extensively
investigated TTB niobates as examples, in Ba2NaNb5O15, 85% Ba and 15% K cations occupy the A1 sites, and
30% Ba and 70% K cations occupy the A2 sites. However, in the case
of Ba2NaNb5O15, only Ba cations occupy
the A1 sites and all the Na cations occupy the A2 sites.28 The ionic radius of Na+ (1.39 Å,
coordination number (CN) 12) is smaller than that of K+ (1.64 Å, CN 12) and Sr2+ (1.44 Å, CN 12).27 Moreover, Na+ can only occupy the
A2 sites.22 Therefore, it is reasonable
that K+ and Sr2+ are substituted for Na+ during the flux treatment.

Figure 2A shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the photocatalysts fabricated
using different kinds of flux. All of the peaks assigned to Sr2KTa5O15 are observed after using only
KCl as the flux material (Figure 2A(a)). Interestingly, all of the main peaks show the
same shifts toward higher angles with an increasing NaCl ratio in
the flux mixture (Figure 2A(b)–(e)). Figure 2C clearly shows that both the a and c axes decrease linearly with an increasing molar ratio
of NaCl in the flux mixture, indicating that NaCl flux affects the
phase structure of the TTB material. This phenomenon is due to the
substitution of K+ and Sr2+ for the smaller
Na+ in the TTB structure, which was verified by the ICP
analysis (Table 1).
The ionic radius of Na+ (1.39 Å, CN 12) is smaller
than that of Sr2+ (1.44 Å, CN 12) and much smaller
than that of K+ (1.64 Å, CN 12); thus, the substitution
leads to structural distortion of the TTB structure. It is noted that
the intensity of the main peaks at 2θ ranging from 25 to 31.5°
decreases drastically when larger ratios ((KCl)75(NaCl)25 and (KCl)0(NaCl)100) of NaCl are used
in the flux (Figure 2A). Specifically, the intensities of the peaks attributed to crystal
planes (hk0) parallel to the [001] direction decrease by more than half,29,30 indicating inhibited growth in the [001] direction, such as that
for the (320), (400), (410), and (630) planes. However, changing the
molar ratio of NaCl in the flux has no obvious influence on the crystallinities
and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas
of the catalysts (Figure 2D). The crystallite diameter determined from the full width
at half-maximum of the (320) plane using the Scherrer equation is
around 40 nm, and the BET specific surface area is around 6 m2 g–1 for all of the catalysts. The results
of XRD pattern analysis suggest that the molar ratio of NaCl in the
flux mixture has a significant effect on the TTB structure, especially
the growth directions of SrxKyNazTa5O15.

samples at 2θ from 34 to 35.5°; (C) lattice parameters

The effect of flux treatment on
the morphology of the as-fabricated
catalysts was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(Figure 3). The catalyst
fabricated by KCl flux shows only rodlike structures with diameters
of 100–300 nm and lengths of 0.5–2 μm (Figure 3a). Two kinds of
morphologies were found in the catalysts fabricated with different
molar ratios of NaCl, i.e., nanorods and nanoparticles (Figure 3b–f). The nanorods show
diameters and lengths similar to those of the catalyst fabricated
using only KCl. The nanoparticles have sizes less than 1 μm.
The high-resolution SEM image of (KCl)55(NaCl)45 shows that some of the nanoparticles have many characteristic steps
and are surrounded by the nanorods (Figure 3d). Similar phenomena have been observed
for Sr-doped NaTaO3 owing to its Sr-rich surface.31 The Sr-rich surface was believed to have advantages
for inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.

Figure 3 SEM images
of samples calcined at 1173 K for 3 h with flux reagent
ratios of (KCl)100(NaCl)0 (a), (KCl)75(NaCl)25 (b), (KCl)55(NaCl)45 (c,
d), (KCl)25(NaCl)75 (e), and (KCl)0(NaCl)100 (f).

The aspect ratio (length/diameter) of the nanorods in the
catalysts
decrease with an increasing molar ratio of NaCl in the flux treatment
(Figure 3b–f).
Because these nanorods grow along the [001] direction, the decrease
in the aspect ratio of the nanorods leads to a decrease in the peak
intensities of the crystal planes (hk0) parallel
to the [001] direction. This result is consistent with the results
of XRD analysis (Figure 2A). Conversely, the number of nanorods decreases and the number of
nanoparticles increases upon increasing the ratio of NaCl in the flux
treatment (Figure 3b–f). The dominant morphology changes from nanorods to nanoparticles
when using only NaCl in the flux treatment (Figure 3a,e). These results can be easily understood:
the substitution of cations causes distortion of the TTB structure;
thus, the change in the morphology of these catalysts is due to the
restricted growth of these specific planes.

The UV–vis
diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra of the catalysts
are shown in Figure 4A. The absorption edges of the as-fabricated catalysts first decrease
to shorter wavelengths and then increase slightly with an increasing
molar ratio of NaCl in the flux treatment, indicating an expansion
and subsequent contraction of the band gaps. The band gaps of (KCl)100(NaCl)0, (KCl)75(NaCl)25, (KCl)55(NaCl)45, (KCl)25(NaCl)75, and (KCl)0(NaCl)100 are estimated
to be 3.89, 3.93, 3.95, 3.92, and 3.89 eV, respectively (Figure 4B) using the Davis–Mott
method.32 The (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst shows the largest band gap of the catalysts fabricated
by using the flux method. The enlarged band gap is due to the substitution
of K+ and Sr2+ for Na+. Large band
gaps in tantalates have been reported to be beneficial for photocatalytic
water splitting and CO2 conversion by H2.33,34 Because the TTB structure of these catalysts still remains after
the substitution, the valence band levels of these catalysts should
be similar.35 The alkali and alkaline-earth
metals were found to affect the conduction band levels in NaTaO3; thus, a larger band gap means a larger conduction band level,
which directly dictates the water splitting and CO2 conversion
ability of a material.

samples
calcined at 1173 K for 3 h with flux reagent ratios of (KCl)100(NaCl)0 (a), (KCl)75(NaCl)25 (b),
(KCl)55(NaCl)45 (c), (KCl)25(NaCl)75 (d), and (KCl)0(NaCl)100 (e).

Figure 5A shows
the K 2p X-ray photoelectron spectra. The two peak components at binding
energies (BEs) of 292.6 and 295.6 eV correspond to K 2p3/2 and K 2p1/2, respectively. The two peaks indicate a spin–orbit
split doublet and can be ascribed to the K oxides and cations, respectively.36 It can be clearly seen that the intensity of
the K 2p peak decreases, increasing the ratio of NaCl in the flux
treatment. When the ratio of NaCl is higher than 50 mol %, almost
all of the K on the surface of the photocatalysts disappears (Figure 5A(d),(e)), even though
K2CO3 is used as a precursor during all of the
fabrication processes. The peaks for K 2p show no obvious shifts with
upon changing the ratio of KCl and NaCl in the flux, indicating that
the environment of the K species is not changed. Conversely, Na is
not found in the catalyst fabricated using only KCl. However, clear
peaks at 1072.6 eV with no obvious shifts attributed to Na 1s are
observed in all of the other catalysts fabricated using different
ratios of NaCl.

(KCl)55(NaCl)45 (c), (KCl)25(NaCl)75 (d), and (KCl)0(NaCl)100 (e).

Because the Sr cations are changed
during the flux treatment, careful
analysis of the Sr 3d X-ray photoelectron spectrum was performed (Figure 6). The Sr 3d spectrum
can be fitted by two doublets (Sr 3d5/2 and 3d3/2) with an energy separation of 1.80 eV, and the branching ratio of
3d5/2/3d3/2 = 1.5.37 Moreover, the “surface” component doublet at high
BE is associated with surface terminal species, such as SrO, Sr(OH)2, and SrCO3. The “lattice” component
doublet at low BE is assigned to the near-surface regions.38−40Table 2 summarizes
the K, Na, Sr, and Ta composition ratios. Although the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate different K and Na to Ta ratios
compared to the ICP results, the two elements show similar trends
with an increasing NaCl molar ratio in the flux treatment (Table 1). Interestingly,
the Sr/Ta ratios of the samples, as derived by XPS, show obvious differences
from those derived by ICP upon increasing the NaCl molar ratio in
the flux treatment. The XPS-derived Sr/Ta values are much higher than
the ICP-derived values in all of these cases, indicating that the
samples present Sr-rich surfaces. The corresponding surface and lattice
Sr/Ta values calculated using the fitting results are shown in Table 2, and it is clear
that the surface Sr/Ta decreases with increasing NaCl in the flux
treatment. It has been previously reported that Sr-doped NaTaO3 easily forms Sr-rich shells covering Sr-poor cores and that
electron–hole recombination is restricted during photoirradiation,
enhancing photocatalytic activity.41,42 In the current
work, a Sr-rich shell with a Sr-poor core is also observed when the
molar ratio of NaCl/KCl is less than 50%. Conversely, a Sr-poor shell
with a Sr-rich core is formed when the molar ratio of NaCl/KCl is
higher than 50% (Table 2). Thus, changing the flux conditions not only affects the cation
occupation but also changes the surface Sr/Ta composition.

We have previously reported that TTB Sr2KTa5O1517 and K2RETa5O15 (RE = rare-earth element)20 fabricated using KCl exhibit good photocatalytic activity
and selectivity toward CO for CO2 conversion using H2O as an electron donor.17,20 In the current study,
the effect of substituting K+ and Sr2+ for Na+ in Sr2KTa5O15 using different
ratios of KCl and NaCl as flux materials on its photocatalytic activity
was investigated. Figure 7 presents the formation rates of evolved gas products using
catalysts fabricated using different ratios of NaCl. The photocatalytic
activity of Sr2KTa5O15 (i.e., the
catalyst fabricated using only KCl) toward CO was 60.2 μmol
h–1, which is consistent with our previous report
(Figure 7a).17 Other kinds of reduction products, such as CH4 or HCOOH, HCHO, and CH3OH, were not detected.
The catalysts fabricated in flux mixtures show enhanced photocatalytic
activities for CO evolution (Figure 7b–d) without any obvious change in H2 generation during photoirradiation. This result indicates that the
substitution of K+ and Sr2+ for Na+ enhances the photocatalytic activity toward CO without any change
in selectivity toward CO evolution. Note that the catalyst fabricated
with the KCl/NaCl molar ratio of 55/45 shows the highest photocatalytic
activity toward CO evolution (94.6 μmol h–1) and good selectivity toward CO (85.3%) (Figure 7c). We summarized other recently reported
materials that used similar systems for photocatalytic conversion
of CO2 using H2O as an electron donor (Table S2). Our catalyst showed good photocatalytic
activity and selectivity toward CO evolution among all these reported
catalysts.

Figure 7 Rates of CO (red filled), O2 (green dotted), and H2 (blue slashed) evolution and related selectivity toward CO
evolution over samples calcined at 1173 K for 3 h with flux reagent
ratios of (KCl)100(NaCl)0 (a), (KCl)75(NaCl)25 (b), (KCl)55(NaCl)45 (c),
(KCl)25(NaCl)75 (d), and (KCl)0(NaCl)100 (e). Conditions: 1.0 wt % Ag cocatalyst loaded by the chemical
reduction method, 1.0 g of catalyst, 400 W high-pressure mercury lamp,
1.0 L of water, CO2 flow rate: 30 mL min–1, additive: NaHCO3 (0.1 mol L–1).

The enhanced photocatalytic activity
is due to the enlarged band
gap with the higher conduction band level and the maintained Sr-rich
surface. The higher conduction band level is beneficial for CO2 conversion because higher conduction band levels possess
stronger reduction potentials.43 The maintained
Sr-rich surface is beneficial for CO2 capture because Sr
as an alkaline-earth metal can be used for the adsorption of CO2.44 The adsorption of CO2 species on the surface of catalysts is shown in Figure S3. CO2 showed strong adsorption on the
surface of catalysts; after introducing
CO2, various kinds of carbonates and bicarbonates have
been formed (1200–1800 cm–1). The intergrade
intensity of these species is much stronger in (KCl)75(NaCl)25, (KCl)55(NaCl)45, and (KCl)25(NaCl)75 as compared to that in (KCl)100(NaCl)0 and (KCl)0(NaCl)100. We have reported
that the adsorption of these species on the surface of a photocatalyst
is important to achieve high activity for the conversion of CO2.45 Thus, catalysts fabricated
using mixture flux enhanced CO2 adsorption and photocatalytic
activity. Further increasing the ratio of NaCl in the flux treatment
leads to a decrease in the photocatalytic activity toward CO (Figure 7d,e); the samples
with lower conduction band levels and Sr-poor surface are not good
for CO2 capture and reduction. This means that too much
NaCl in the flux mixture destroys the TTB structure, affecting the
conduction band level and surface Sr/Ta ratio, leading to a decrease
in the photocatalytic activity for CO2 conversion.

Blank tests suggest that all of the components of the system, i.e.,
photocatalyst, photoirradiation, CO2 bubbling, the Ag cocatalyst,
and the NaHCO3 additive, are necessary to achieve the highly
selective conversion of CO2 into CO (Figure S2), as we have previously reported.10 In the photocatalytic conversion of the CO2 reaction,
the photocatalyst absorbs photons in bulk to generate electrons and
holes. The photoexcited electrons subsequently migrate to the surface
active sites to reduce CO2 and H+. On the other
hand, the holes are used to oxidize H2O. It is well known
that the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO occurs
selectively on a Ag metal electrode in aqueous solution.46,47 Similarly, the Ag cocatalysts function as active sites to capture
the photoexcited electrons on the surface of catalysts for the reduction
of CO2. The loading amount dependence of Ag on the photocatalytic
activity is shown in Figure S4. Ag (1.0
wt %) showed the highest photocatalytic activity toward CO evolution
among these catalysts with different amounts of Ag loading.

The recycle test was performed to confirm the stability and durability
of our catalyst and system using the Ag-modified (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst (Figure 8). CO was evolved as the main reduction product, and
a small amount of H2 was generated during the three runs.
Simultaneously, the evolution of O2 increased linearly
during the reaction. The evolution of CO, H2, and O2 are in an approximately stoichiometric ratio, indicating
that the number of photoelectrons used for the conversion of CO2 and protons is equivalent to the number of holes consumed
for H2O oxidation. The formation rate of CO slightly decreases
together with slight increase in the formation rate of H2 during the third run. However, as compared to the decline in the
formation rate of CO using the (KCl)100(NaCl)0 catalyst reported previously,17 the decline
in CO evolution over the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst
is much slower. This result means that the substitution of K+ and Sr2+ for Na+ in Sr2KTa5O15 not only enhances the photocatalytic activity
but also enhances the stability toward CO evolution.

Figure 8 Time courses of CO (circle),
O2 (square), and H2 (triangle) evolutions for
the photocatalytic conversion of
CO2 by H2O over the Ag-loaded sample calcined
at 1173 K for 3 h with a flux reagent ratio of (KCl)55(NaCl)45. Amount of catalyst: 1.0 g, loading amount of cocatalyst:
1.0 wt % Ag cocatalyst loaded by the chemical reduction method, light
source: 400 W high-pressure mercury lamp, volume of water: 1.0 L,
CO2 flow rate: 30 mL min–1, additive:
NaHCO3 (0.1 mol L–1).

Figure 9 shows the
DR spectra before the reaction, after the first run, and after the
third run for the Ag-loaded catalyst fabricated using the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst. A Ag surface plasmon absorption
around 350–600 nm is observed in the before-reaction catalyst.
After the first reaction cycle, the shape and intensity of the Ag
plasmon absorption is similar to that of the before-reaction catalyst,
suggesting that the situation of Ag cocatalyst is not significantly
changed during the first run. However, the intensity after the third
run is smaller than that after the first run, indicating that the
amount of Ag cocatalyst decreases.9 This
result means that the decrease of Ag cocatalyst has an obvious effect
on the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to CO by H2O, leading to a decrease of the photocatalytic activity toward
CO and selectivity toward CO evolution, which is consistent with our
previous reports.11,44 In contrast, the catalyst prepared
by using only KCl shows an obvious decrease in the intensity of the
Ag plasmon absorption, even after the first run (Figure S5). This means that the Ag deposited on the surface
of the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst is much more
stable than that deposited on the (KCl)100(NaCl)0 catalyst.

Figure 9 UV–vis DR spectra of 1.0 wt % Ag-loaded sample calcined
at 1173 K for 3 h with a flux reagent ratio of (KCl)55(NaCl)45 before reaction (a), after first run (b), and after third
run (c).

To further investigate the change
of Ag cocatalyst on the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst,
we used SEM to observe the
morphology change of the Ag cocatalyst. It can be clearly seen that
small Ag particles are well arched on the surface of both the nanorods
and nanoparticles before the reaction (Figure 10a,b). The average size of the Ag particles
before the reaction is ∼5.6 nm (Figure S6a). We have previously reported that small Ag cocatalyst
particles are more efficient than large Ag particles during photocatalytic
conversion of CO2 using H2O as the electron
donor in aqueous NaHCO3 solution.11,12,44 For the same amount of Ag, smaller Ag particles
present more active sites than larger Ag particles, leading to high
photocatalytic activity for CO evolution. After the first run, some
aggregation of Ag is observed in the SEM images (Figure 10c,d). The sizes of some Ag
particles increase to 10–20 nm (Figure S6b), which may be due to the dissolution-rephotodeposition
of Ag particles.9 It is also noted that
some small Ag particles still remain on the surface of the photocatalyst,
which is consistent with the DR spectra. The aggregation and size
growth of Ag on the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst
is much slower than that on the (KCl)100(NaCl)0 catalyst.17 However, obvious aggregation
is observed in the SEM images (Figure 10e,f), with the size of the Ag particles
reaching 20–40 nm after the third run (Figure S6c). The increase in the size of the Ag particles
leads to a decrease in the number of active sites for CO evolution,
leading to a decrease in the amount of CO formed. We also noted that
the amount of H2 formed increases for the second and third
runs. Because the Ag particles are not the active sites for H2 evolution but for CO evolution, the formation of H2 increases with a decrease in the number of active sites for CO evolution.
The analysis above clearly demonstrates that it is necessary to maintain
the small particle size of the Ag cocatalyst to ensure a stable rate
of CO formation during the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 by H2O in aqueous NaHCO3 solution.

Figure 10 SEM images
of 1.0 wt % Ag-loaded sample calcined at 1173 K for
3 h with a flux reagent ratio of (KCl)55(NaCl)45 before the reaction (a, b), after the first run (c, d), and after
the third run (e, f).

3 Conclusions
Substitution of K+ and Sr2+ for Na+ was easily achieved during
the preparation of SrxKyNazTa5O15 using different ratios of KCl and NaCl
as flux reagents. This substitution not only showed effects on the
phase and morphology of the photocatalysts but also changed their
band gaps and surface compositions. The photocatalytic activity for
CO2 conversion using H2O as an electron donor
was enhanced by the substitution without obviously changing the selectivity
toward CO evolution. More importantly, the stability of the formation
rate of CO was also enhanced by using the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 catalyst as compared to that of the photocatalyst fabricated
using only KCl. This is because the Ag cocatalyst was more stable
on the surface of the (KCl)55(NaCl)45 photocatalyst.

4 Experimental Section
Catalysts were fabricated by a
flux method using pure KCl (99.8%,
Wako) or NaCl (99.9%, Wako) or mixtures with different molar ratios
of KCl and NaCl. A stoichiometric mixture of K2CO3 (99.5%, Wako), SrCO3 (99.9%, Wako), and Ta2O5 (99.9%, Kojundo) was ground with the flux reagents
in an Al2O3 mortar for 5 min. The total mass
ratio of the flux reagents to the precursors (K2CO3, SrCO3, and Ta2O5) was fixed
at 1.0. The mixture was then transferred to a 50 mL Al2O3 crucible calcined at 1173 K for 3 h in air. After cooling
down to room temperature, the mixture was thoroughly washed with distilled
water at 358 K three times to remove any residual salts and then dried
in air at 80 °C. The same procedure was employed in all catalyst
fabrication processes. The catalysts were labeled as (KCl)x(NaCl)100–x, where x represents the mol % of KCl and (100–x) represents the mol % of NaCl. For instance, (KCl)55(NaCl)45 denotes a catalyst fabricated using 55 mol % KCl and 45
mol % NaCl as the flux reactants. The Ag cocatalyst was deposited
on the as-fabricated catalysts by a chemical reduction method. Specifically,
1.8 mL of an aqueous NaPH2O2 solution (0.33
mol L–1) was added to 50 mL of a suspension of the
photocatalyst (1.5 g) containing 1.4 mL of AgNO3 (0.1 mol
L–1). After stirring at 358 K for 1.5 h, the suspension
was filtered and dried in air at room temperature prior to further
use.

Elemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma optical
emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCAP7400 Duo, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.)
has been used for determining the real chemical formula. The structure
and crystallinity of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) using a Rigaku Multiflex powder X-ray diffractometer. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area was measured by N2 adsorption at 77
K using a volumetric gas adsorption apparatus (BELmini, Bel Japan,
Inc.). The UV–vis diffuse reflectance (UV–vis DR) spectra
were measured using a JASCO Corporation V-670 spectrometer equipped
with an integrating sphere. A spectralon filled with BaSO4, supplied by Labsphere Inc., was used as a reflection standard.
The XPS measurement was acquired using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer
(ESCA 3400, Shimadzu Corp.). SEM images were obtained from field emission
scanning electron microscopy (SU-8220, Hitachi High-Technologies)
equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy apparatus. Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the catalysts and adsorbed CO2 species were observed with an FT/IR-4700 spectrometer (JASCO
Corporation) equipped with a mercury–cadmium–tellurium
detector cooled by liquid N2 in a transmission mode at
303 K. About 50 mg of each sample was pressed into a wafer 10 mm in
diameter at the pressure of 10 MPa. The wafer was then placed in a
cylindrical glass cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The
cell allowed us to perform heating, O2 treatment, introduction
of CO2 gas, and in situ spectral measurements. The wafer
was evacuated at 873 K for 30 min before measurement, followed by
treatment under about 4.67 KPa of O2 for 30 min, and subsequently
it was evacuated and cooled to 303 K. For each spectrum, data from
128 scans were accumulated at a resolution of 4 cm–1.

The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 by H2O was carried out in a flow system using an inner-irradiation-type
reaction vessel at room temperature and ambient pressure (Figure S1). The photocatalyst (1.0 g) was dispersed
in ultrapure water (1.0 L) containing 0.1 mol NaHCO3. CO2 gas (99.999%) was bubbled into the solution at a flow rate
of 30 mL min–1 for 1 h before the photoirradiation
and continuously flowed during the photoirradiation. The suspension
was irradiated under a 400 W high-pressure mercury lamp, with a quartz
filter connected to a water cooling system. The gaseous products generated,
such as H2, O2, and CO, were analyzed by thermal
conductivity detector-gas chromatography using a GC-8A chromatographer
(Shimadzu Corp.) equipped with a 5A molecular sieve column, with Ar
as the carrier gas, and by flame ionization detector-gas chromatography
with a methanizer using a ShinCarbon ST column, with N2 as the carrier gas.

The selectivity toward CO evolution compared
with H2 evolution and the balance between consumed electrons
(e–) and holes (h+) is generally described
using the formulae
shown below    where RCO, RH2,
and RO2 represent
the rates of formation of CO, H2, and O2, respectively.
