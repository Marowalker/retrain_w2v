DNA aptamers are single-stranded
oligonucleotides that are generated
by an in vitro selection method to bind targets with high affinity
and specificity. Understanding molecular recognition by DNA aptamers
is of fundamental importance in the development of biosensor applications.
The small molecule ochratoxin A (OTA) is a fungal-derived food toxin,
and OTA DNA aptamers have been established for the development of
rapid detection platforms required for food safety. One such OTA aptamer
(OTAA) is a guanine-rich DNA oligonucleotide that folds into an antiparallel
G-quadruplex (GQ) upon OTA binding, although structural details of
the GQ fold and its interaction with OTA are currently unknown. In
the present study, the fluorescent nucleobase analogue, 8-thienyl-2′-deoxyguanosine
(ThdG), was inserted into various G sites of OTAA to determine the
probe impact on GQ folding and OTA binding affinity. Our results suggest
that OTAA contains three lateral (l) loops connecting two stacked
G-tetrads with an anticlockwise loop progression to afford a −(lll)
GQ topology. The phenolic ring system of OTA undergoes π-stacking
interactions with the G-tetrads of OTAA. Our results also demonstrate
aptamer sites that can be modified with ThdG to afford a fluorescent
light-up signal upon OTA binding.

Introduction
Aptamers are single-stranded
oligonucleotides that bind a variety
of targets, including small molecules, proteins, and cells, with high
affinity and specificity.1,2 DNA aptamers have the
potential to replace antibodies as recognition elements due to their
ease of synthesis on a large-scale level at low cost and their higher
chemical stability.3,4 They are also much easier to modify
than antibodies,5 and efforts have been
focused on the utility of chemically modified aptamers to improve
chemical diversity for enhanced target binding affinity6−11 and therapeutic potential.12,13

Aptamer base
modifications can create fluorescent nucleobase analogues
(FBAs) that facilitate sensitive biophysical measurements14,15 and are ideal candidates for characterizing local binding events.16,17 One simple strategy for preparation of a novel FBA series is arylation
of the 8-position of 2′-deoxyguanosine (dG) to afford a fluorescent
8-aryl-dG base.18−25 Such FBAs have proven useful for monitoring G-quadruplex (GQ) folding
because the bases exhibit intense fluorescence in the GQ compared
to their emission in a duplex structure. Furthermore, depending on
their site of incorporation, they minimally perturb the native GQ.
This feature can be exploited for aptamer detection by G-rich DNA
aptamers that frequently fold into a GQ upon target binding.18,20,23 A classic example is the 15-mer
thrombin binding aptamer (TBA, 5′-GGTTGGTGTGGTTGG26) that produces an antiparallel GQ consisting
of two G-tetrads connected through lateral (TGT and two TT) loops.27 The guanosine residues within the tetrads display
an alternating syn- and anti-conformation (see G-tetrad in Figure 1A) and interact through
Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds stabilized by a central potassium ion and
provide a scaffold for thrombin binding to the loop residues.27

syn-
and anti-G bases with a central K+ ion (purple ball); (B)

FBA 8-thienyl-2′-dG (ThdG) and sequence of the 31-mer OTA aptamer
(OTAA) with possible G-tetrad-Gs underlined in bold, indicating sites
of ThdG incorporation.

Recently, we incorporated 8-thienyl-dG (ThdG,28Figure 1) into TBA and demonstrated the utility of the probe for monitoring
thrombin binding using fluorescence spectroscopy.23 The ThdG probe favors a syn-conformation28 and stabilizes the antiparallel GQ when placed in a syn-G-tetrad
position but destabilizes the GQ in an anti-G-tetrad position, as
evidenced by UV thermal melting experiments.23 The fluorescent nature of ThdG (λex = 315 nm, λem = 411 nm in TBA,23 ϕfl = 0.79 for free nucleoside in water28) also provides a diagnostic energy-transfer excitation peak at 290
nm for probe stacking with a G-tetrad,23 which can distinguish G-tetrad guanosines from those in loop and
tail positions. Finally, ThdG exhibits quenched emission in the duplex
that lights-up in the GQ, providing emission switching properties
for monitoring thrombin binding using duplex → GQ exchange.23

DNA aptamers have also been generated
for the small molecule ochratoxin
A (OTA, Figure 1).29−31 OTA is a common food-contaminating mycotoxin produced by the species Aspergillus and Penicillium.32 It is detected in a wide variety of foodstuffs,
including cereals, coffee, dried fruits, wine, and beers, and is a
potent renal carcinogen.33 Given its toxicity
and world-wide occurrence, rapid OTA detection platforms are of great
interest for food safety.34 Previously
developed platforms required an OTA antibody for immunoreaction-based
assays.35−37 The discovery of OTA aptamers29−31 has opened
the door for the development of DNA-based detection platforms,38−40 and the OTA–aptamer (OTAA) interaction is fast becoming a
proof-of-concept system for small molecule detection.41

The first described in vitro selection for an OTA
aptamer produced
a 61-mer that binds OTA in a 1:1 fashion with an apparent dissociation
constant (Kd) of 0.36 μM.29 Aptamer truncation afforded a G-rich 31-mer
(Figure 1C) as the
shortest sequence, with a Kd less than
1 μM.29 The analysis of the OTAA–OTA
interaction using circular dichroism (CD) identified an antiparallel
GQ aptamer topology upon OTA binding;38 however, structural details of the GQ topology and its interaction
with OTA are unknown. The knowledge of an aptamer–target structure
is critical for optimizing analytical potential, aptamer length for
ease of synthesis, establishing preferred site(s) of modification
for enhanced aptamer performance and expanding our understanding of
self-assembly and molecular recognition. Unfortunately, determination
of a high-resolution GQ-target structure using NMR or X-ray crystallography
is not a trivial task. Both require expensive instrumentation to yield
data that are challenging for interpretation from relatively large
quantities of the aptamer–target complex, often involving 13C,15N-enriched DNA for NMR analysis. This suggested
the potential utility of ThdG to probe the OTAA–OTA interaction
using dilute aptamer solutions. Our studies provide a model for the
overall antiparallel GQ topology of OTAA and demonstrate aptamer sites
that can be modified by ThdG to afford a fluorescent light-up signal
upon OTA binding. Furthermore, we have established that the intrinsic
fluorescence of OTA is a sensitive marker for measuring aptamer–target
binding affinities.

Results and Discussion
Probe Influence on GQ Folding
Analysis of the 31-mer
OTAA using the on-line QGRS mapper for predicting GQ formation42 suggests that eight GQ structures with two G-tetrads
and three loops are possible. The central 11 Gs (highlighted in bold
and underlined for native OTAA in Figure 1C) can participate in GQ formation. Common
to all eight GQs are the involvement of G15 and G16, which must be present in the G-tetrad. The other G-tetrad sites
are derived from guanosine residues in a three-base cluster (G5–G7, G11–G13, and G23–G25) indicating that the first
or last two guanosines of each cluster participate in G-tetrad formation.
To distinguish guanosine residues in G-tetrad positions from those
in loops and tail regions, the ThdG probe was inserted into the three
three-base clusters of the aptamer (Figure 1C) via solid-phase synthesis to yield nine
modified strands (ThdG-phosphoramidite has been previously described;23 see Supporting Information (SI) for mass spectrometry (MS) of mOTAA samples). The mOTAA
oligonucleotides were analyzed using UV–vis thermal melting,
fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy to determine probe influence on
GQ topology.

The UV thermal melting (Tm) values of the mOTAA samples (6 μM) were recorded in
a previously optimized OTA binding buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM
CaCl2, 120 mM NaCl, and 5 mM KCl)29 by monitoring the change in absorbance at 295 nm as a function of
temperature. Under these conditions the native OTAA antiparallel GQ
had an average Tm of 46.6 °C from
the five heating and cooling ramps. The change in Tm (ΔTm) induced by ThdG
(Figure 2) in G5–G7 and G11–G13 displayed positive ΔTm values
at G6 and G11 that were followed by strongly
negative values at G7 and G12, as expected for
ThdG placement within the G-tetrad at syn-G (G6 and G11) versus anti-G (G7 and G12) positions.23 In contrast, placement of the ThdG probe at
positions G5 and G13 reduced Tm of the GQ to only a minor extent, suggesting that these
guanosine residues are not in the G-tetrad. For G23–G25, positive ΔTm values were
observed at both G23 and G24, whereas it was
not possible to record a Tm value with
the probe at G25. The lack of Tm for the ThdG-25 suggested probe placement at an anti-G-tetrad position
that completely hindered GQ folding, as observed previously for TBA,
with certain 8-aryl-dG derivatives inserted into anti-G-tetrad sites.19 For the modified sites that afforded Tm values, the error bars presented in Figure 2 represent the range
in ΔTm due to differences in the
melting and annealing curves (hysteresis). Representative melting
curves for native OTAA and ThdG-24 are provided in the SI (Figure S1).

Figure 2 Change in UV
thermal melting temperature (ΔTm) of the antiparallel GQ produced by OTAA upon site-specific
incorporation of ThdG. Oligonucleotide solutions (6 μM) were
monitored at 295 nm over five ramps at a rate of 0.5 °C min–1 in the OTA binding buffer. ΔTm = Tm (mOTAA GQ) – Tm (native OTAA GQ). Error bars represent
the range in ΔTm due to differences
in Tm values between the melting and annealing
curves (hysteresis).

The influence of the ThdG probe on the antiparallel GQ topology,
as monitored by CD, and the fluorescence response of the probe (λex = 316 nm and λem = 411 nm) is highlighted
in Figure 3. For the
first three-base cluster (G5–G7, Figure 3A,B), only ThdG-6
generated the characteristic antiparallel CD spectrum (red-dashed
trace, Figure 3A) produced
by native OTAA (black trace, Figure 3A) with positive peaks at 290 and 240 nm and a negative
peak at 260 nm. The CD spectrum of ThdG-7 exhibited a broad positive
peak at 275 nm and a negative peak at 246 nm (red dotted trace), suggesting
a perturbed GQ topology. ThdG-5 displayed the positive peak at 290
nm for the antiparallel topology, but failed to exhibit the strong
negative peak at 260 nm (solid red trace, Figure 3A). The fluorescence response of these mOTAA
samples all displayed the diagnostic 290 nm peak in the excitation
spectrum signifying probe stacking with the G-tetrad (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 Circular dichroism (A,
C, and E) and fluorescence excitation/emission
(B, D, and F) spectra of native OTAA (solid black traces in (A), (B),
and (E)) and mOTAA GQ (solid, dashed, and dotted red traces in (A)–(F)).
All spectra of oligonucleotides (6 μM) were recorded at 10 °C
in the OTA binding buffer.

At the G11–G13 sites, both ThdG-11
(solid red trace) and ThdG-13 (dotted red trace) produced the antiparallel
GQ observed for the native OTAA (Figure 3C). The CD spectrum for ThdG-12 (dashed red
trace, Figure 3C) resembled
the CD spectrum of ThdG-7 (dotted red trace, Figure 3A), implying similar perturbation to the
GQ topology. The fluorescence spectra of ThdG-11 (solid red trace)
and ThdG-12 (dashed red trace) displayed the 290 nm peak in the excitation
spectrum for G-tetrad stacking (Figure 3D). The ThdG-13 mOTAA exhibited relatively bright emission
with no peak at 290 nm in the excitation spectrum (dotted trace, Figure 3D), suggesting no
probe stacking with the G-tetrad.

In the final G23–G25 three-base cluster,
only ThdG-24 (dashed red trace, Figure 3E) produced the antiparallel GQ topology. This mOTAA
sample also displayed a strong positive ΔTm value for GQ folding (Figure 2), suggesting probe placement within the G-tetrad at
a syn-G position. The probe also exhibited a strong prominent 290
nm peak in the excitation spectrum, signifying probe stacking with
the G-tetrad (dashed red trace, Figure 3F). In contrast, the CD spectrum for ThdG-23 (that
also displayed a positive ΔTm value, Figure 2) exhibited a broad
positive band peaking at 265 nm with a negative peak at 245 nm (solid
red trace, Figure 3E), suggesting formation of GQ with a parallel topology.21 The ThdG-25 sample exhibited a broad positive
peak at 275 nm and a negative peak at 246 nm (red dotted trace) suggesting
a perturbed GQ topology. The fluorescence spectra of the ThdG-23 and
ThdG-25 samples displayed the 290 nm peak in the excitation spectra,
although the peak was not particularly prominent, especially for the
ThdG-25 sample (dotted red trace, Figure 3F). Overall, the CD analysis confirmed that
only four mOTAA samples (ThdG-6, -11, -13, and -24) fold into the
antiparallel GQ topology, as noted for native OTAA. Three of the four
oligonucleotides (ThdG-6, -11, and -24) also strongly stabilized the
GQ structure (Figure 2), suggesting probe placement in syn-G-tetrad positions. ThdG-13
also produced the antiparallel fold yet slightly decreased GQ stability
(Figure 2), suggesting
probe placement in a loop, where the syn-conformation of the probe
can be tolerated.

Probe Influence on OTA Binding
To
determine the impact
of the ThdG probe on target binding, titrations were performed by
monitoring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of OTA upon aptamer
addition. In the OTA binding buffer, the free toxin has an excitation
(λex) of 375 nm and emission (λem) at 432 nm. This fluorescence was found to be sensitive to aptamer
binding, and changes in excitation/emission wavelength and intensity
were employed to measure OTA binding affinity. Previously reported
OTA binding studies with the 31-mer OTAA were carried out using equilibrium
dialysis and afforded an apparent Kd of
0.5 μM.29 Differences in Kd values can occur when the method used to determine
it changes;41 therefore, a fluorescence
titration was performed with the native OTAA to afford a standard Kd value.

When the native OTAA was added
to the toxin in the binding buffer, the OTA excitation underwent a
bathochromic (red) shift, which was accompanied by loss in intensity,
suggesting π-stacking interactions of the phenolic group of
OTA with the antiparallel GQ (Figure 4A).43 The OTA emission underwent
a hypsochromic (blue) shift with reduced intensity, suggesting placement
of the OTA in a more nonpolar environment upon OTAA binding.44 Through monitoring the changes in excitation
at 375 nm, a binding isotherm was produced (inset, Figure 4A) that afforded a 1:1 binding
interaction with an apparent Kd of 1.1
μM.

OTAA, (B) ThdG-11 mOTAA, and (C) ThdG-12 mOTAA at 20 °C. Inset:
intensity change in fluorescence excitation (λex =
375 nm) with increasing aptamer concentration.

To confirm that OTA binding to the 31-mer OTAA was sequence
and
structure specific, negative control titrations using the 15-mer TBA
and the 22-mer human telomeric repeat sequence (HTelo22)21 that can also form antiparallel GQ structures
were carried out (Figure S2A,B, SI). In
each case, the fluorescence response of OTA indicated no change in
λex or λem wavelengths or intensities,
suggesting no binding of OTA to GQ structures produced by TBA or HTelo22.

Given the sensitivity of OTA fluorescence to aptamer binding, the
same titration conditions were used to determine OTA affinity for
the mOTAA strands. Representative titrations (Figure 4B,C) emphasize the drastic influence of the
probe location on the OTA–aptamer interaction. For addition
of the ThdG-11 sample (Figure 4B), OTA excitation and emission underwent similar changes
noted for addition of native OTAA and a Kd of 2.1 μM was determined, suggesting that the ThdG probe at
G11 minimally impacts OTA binding. The additional excitation
peaks in Figure 4B
at 290 and 315 nm are due to the ThdG probe within the mOTAA sample
and suggest GQ formation due to the strong energy-transfer peak at
290 nm. In sharp contrast, the OTA fluorescence displayed no response
to addition of the ThdG-12 sample over the course of the titration
(Figure 4B), suggesting
that OTA did not bind to the mOTAA. Fluorescence titrations for the
other mOTAA samples are given in the SI (Figure S3). Negative control fluorescence
titrations were also performed with the nonchlorinated ochratoxin
B (OTB) derivative, which is less toxic than OTA and is frequently
found as a co-contaminant of food sources.33 Neither the native OTAA nor the ThdG-11 mOTAA samples displayed
OTB binding affinity (Figure S4, SI).

The results from ThdG impact on GQ folding and OTA binding are
summarized in Table 1. Due to disruption of the antiparallel GQ, no OTA binding was observed
with ThdG placed at predicted anti-G-tetrad sites (G7,
G12, and G25), as anticipated. At predicted
syn-G-tetrad sites (G6, G11, and G24), probe placement at G11 was an optimal location for
FBA insertion to monitor OTA binding, whereas G24 insertion
surprisingly inhibited toxin binding. For probe placements at G5, G13, and G23, which are not predicted
to reside in the G-tetrads, G5 and G23 were
disruptive to OTA binding, whereas G13 had minimal impact.

Model for the OTA–OTAA
Interaction
The unimolecular
antiparallel GQ produced by OTAA contains two stacked tetrads connected
by three loops. According to the geometric formalism for DNA GQ folding
presented by da Silva45 and co-workers,46 the characteristic antiparallel CD spectrum
produced by OTAA places it in group III that contains four possible
antiparallel GQ topologies with two stacked tetrads (Figure 5).46 Starting from the 5′-end of OTAA, the spectral data with
the mOTAA samples suggest that G5 is present in the 5′-tail,
placing G6 (syn), G7 (anti), G11 (syn),
and G12 (anti) in the tetrad. This indicates that the first
loop contains three-residues (T8G9T10) starting with a pyrimidine, which commonly form diagonal loops
(d) and lateral loops (l) with wide grooves.45 However, none of the four possible antiparallel GQ topologies start
with a diagonal loop and thus the first TGT loop of OTAA is a lateral
loop stretching across a wide groove. It is noteworthy that TBA also
contains a lateral wide TGT loop as the second loop in the sequence.27

Figure 5 Schematic structures of antiparallel GQs containing two
stacked
tetrads connected by three loops and predicted model for −(lll)
GQ topology for OTAA.

The spectral data also suggests that G13 is part
of
a two-residue loop (G13T14), which represents
the central loop in the antiparallel GQ. Two-residue loops are too
short to form a diagonal loop and typically occupy a lateral narrow
loop.45 This restriction rules out (−ld
+ l) and (+ld – l) topologies (Figure 5) for the antiparallel GQ produced by OTAA
and indicates that all three loops must be lateral. The final loop
is predicted to be an unusual seven-residue lateral wide loop in which
there is a possibility for the looping bases to form hydrogen-bond
alignments. The optical data strongly suggests that G24 (syn) and G25 (anti) are present in the tetrad with G23 in the seven-residue loop. Overall, OTAA is predicted to
form the −(lll) GQ topology with an anticlockwise loop progression,
which is stereoisomeric of the clockwise +(lll) topology produced
by TBA.45 For TBA, the central lateral
loop spans a wide groove, whereas the first and third loops span narrow
grooves.27 For OTAA, the first and third
loops span wide grooves, whereas the central two-residue loop is restricted
to spanning a narrow groove. The −(lll) topology predicted
for OTAA was first reported in 2009 for the chair-type GQ formed by
a Bombyx mori telomeric sequence (d[TAGG(TTAGG)3]) that contains three lateral TTA loops, with the central
loop spanning across a narrow groove.47

The optical data for OTA binding to the −(lll) GQ topology
for OTAA suggests that the phenolic moiety of the toxin undergoes
π-stacking interactions (Figure 4). Although toxin placement within the −(lll)
GQ topology is uncertain, it is noteworthy that ThdG insertion at
G6, G11, G13, and G24 all
produced the antiparallel GQ topology of the native OTAA (Table 1). Of these mOTAA
samples, G6, G11, and G13 had relatively
little impact on OTA binding, suggesting that these guanosine residues
do not interact directly with the toxin. In contrast, ThdG insertion
at G24 inhibited toxin binding, suggesting that this guanosine
residue interacts directly with OTA and the thiophene ring of the
probe inhibits insertion of the toxin into its binding site. Probe
placement at G5 also perturbed OTA binding (Table 1), and previous studies have
demonstrated the importance of the 5′- and 3′-tails
for OTA binding affinity.29 This information
suggests that the toxin may insert between the G-tetrad residues G24 and G25, which is distant from G6,
G11, and G13 and would permit interaction of
the toxin with the tail residues. Further efforts are ongoing to refine
this model for OTA binding to OTAA using additional FBAs.

Duplex–GQ
Exchange for OTA Detection
Although
the ThdG probe is not practical for OTA detection strategies in the
low nanomolar regime because its emission at 411 nm overlaps with
the emission of OTA and it lacks sufficient brightness in low nanomolar
concentrations, it was still employed in duplex → GQ exchange
studies to demonstrate the potential of an internal 8-aryl-dG probe
for OTA detection. For these studies, the ThdG-11 mOTAA sample was
initially annealed to a 12-mer complementary strand 5′-CCATCCACACCC
that produces a G13-T mismatch in the duplex with the aptamer
and quenches the fluorescence emission of the ThdG probe at G11. Upon addition of 1.2 equiv of OTA at room temperature,
no change in the ThdG probe fluorescence was observed, suggesting
that the toxin was unable to facilitate denaturation of the duplex.
Thus, a thermal ramp was employed to melt the duplex (heat to 80 °C)
and promote OTA binding to mOTAA upon slow cooling to 20 °C (Figure 6A). Under these conditions,
the aptamer sample containing OTA exhibited a 3.5-fold increase in
emission intensity of the ThdG probe, with λex =
290 nm (solid red trace vs dashed red trace, Figure 6A) upon slow cooling to 20 °C. In contrast,
the sample lacking the toxin regenerated the quenched emission of
the ThdG probe upon slow cooling to 20 °C (black traces, Figure 6A). These observations
suggested that the toxin was able to bind to the mOTAA sample and
facilitate GQ formation, which accounted for the 3.5-fold increase
in emission intensity of the ThdG probe.

equiv, red traces) and absence (black traces) of OTA. (B) Fluorescence
spectra of the sample containing OTA prior (dashed lines) and after
(solid lines) the thermal experiment. Red traces represent changes
in the excitation and emission of OTA, whereas blue traces represent
changes in the emission of the ThdG probe.

Full fluorescence spectra of the samples were also obtained
before
and after completion of the thermal experiment (Figure 6B). A 1.9-fold increase in emission of the
ThdG probe at 411 nm was observed between the beginning and end of
the thermal experiment (dashed blue trace vs solid blue trace, Figure 6B), and the increase
in intensity of the 290 nm peak in the excitation spectrum are positive
indicators of GQ formation. In addition, the observed excitation of
OTA at 375 nm displayed characteristic quenching and red-shifting,
indicative of π-stacking and binding to the GQ (dashed red trace
vs solid red trace, Figure 6B). The spectral data presented in Figure 6B confirmed that the 3.5-fold increase in
emission intensity in the thermal melting experiment (Figure 6B) was due to OTA binding to
the mOTAA sample with GQ formation and displacement of the complementary
strand.

Conclusions
The studies presented
here demonstrate the utility of internal
emissive nucleobase probes for monitoring small molecule–aptamer
interactions. The information gained from this study indicates that
FBAs can serve as structural probes to determine the topology of an
antiparallel GQ motif critical for target binding. The internal ThdG
probe also provided insight into target binding location, as certain
probe locations that afforded the antiparallel GQ topology were found
to inhibit OTA binding, suggesting that the thiophene ring system
of the probe blocked toxin insertion into the aptamer binding site.
The structural ThdG probe was also employed as a sensor in a duplex
→ GQ fluorescent light-up system to demonstrate the potential
utility of internal FBAs for OTA detection methods. Although the ThdG
probe itself is not practical for OTA detection methods in food samples
in low nanomolar concentrations, it successfully inferred structural
information on the nature of the OTA–OTAA interaction. This
information is currently being utilized to guide probe placement of
new FBA sensors that may be practical for rapid OTA aptasensor detection
strategies required for food safety.

Experimental Section
Materials
OTA was supplied as a 99.5% pure powder from
Dr. Hans-Ulrich Humpf at the University of Münster, Germany,
and quantified in MeOH via UV–vis at 333 nm, with extinction
coefficient of 6400 mol–1 cm–1.48 The nonchlorinated OTB derivative
was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Canada and quantified
in MeOH via UV–vis at 318 nm, with extinction coefficient of
6900 mol–1 cm–1.49 Unmodified oligonucleotides including the TBA and HTelo22
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd. and purified via reverse phase
cartridge purification.

Oligonucleotide Synthesis
The unmodified
OTAA and ThdG–mOTAA
strands were synthesized via standard phosphoramidite synthesis with
a 5′-dimethoxytrityl (DMT) label and were carried out on a
1 μmol scale on a MerMade 12 solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesizer.
The ThdG-phosphoramidite was synthesized according to previously published
protocols.23 DNA was purified via high-performance
liquid chromatography and the DMT was removed in the presence of mildly
acidic high purity water. Masses of the modified OTAA strands were
acquired on a Bruker AmaZon ion trap SL spectrometer in a solution
of 90% high purity water and 10% methanol, with 0.1 mM ammonium acetate.

UV Thermal Denaturation
Solutions were prepared to
a concentration of 6 μM OTAA in OTA binding buffer consisting
of 20 mM CaCl2, 120 mM NaCl, 10 mM trisphosphate, and 5
mM KCl, with pH 8.0.29 Samples were monitored
at 295 nm on a Cary 300-Bio Spectrometer with a 6 × 6 multicell
block with Peltier thermal controller. The samples were heated and
cooled at a rate of 0.5 °C min–1, and an average
of five ramps was reported. Thermal melting temperatures (Tm values) were calculated by determining the
first derivative of the melting curve through the Varian Thermal software.

Circular Dichroism
CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco
J-815 CD spectrophotometer equipped with a thermal controlled 1 ×
6 multicell block. The annealed samples obtained from the Tm studies were measured at 10 °C in quartz
cells (110-QS), with a light path of 1 mm, and monitored between 200
and 400 nm at a bandwidth of 1 nm and scanning speed of 100 nm min–1. A minimum of three scans were collected and averaged.
Data was corrected against a blank measurement of the appropriate
buffer and smoothed using the Jasco software.

OTA Binding Titrations
OTA was prepared as a 100 μL
solution with concentration of 3 μM in a Hellma Analytics ultra-micro
cuvette 105.253-QS, with path length of 10 × 2 mm2, with temperature control at 20 °C. Strands of mOTAA were titrated
until a final concentration of 2–3 equiv of aptamer to OTA
was reached. Scans were taken directly after manual mixing of the
solution. A plot of the fraction of OTA bound versus concentration
of mOTAA generated a binding isotherm that was analyzed with SigmaPlot
11.0 using the one site saturation ligand binding macro to obtain Kd values and standard errors.
