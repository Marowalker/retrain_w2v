Most of the microscopy-based,
quantitative assays rely on fluorescent
dyes. In this study, we investigated the impact of fluorescent dyes
on the dielectrophoretic response of the mammalian cells. The dielectrophoretic
measurements were performed to quantify whether the fluorescent dyes
alter the dielectrophoretic properties of the cells at single-cell
resolution. Our results present that when 10 Vpp electric
field is applied, the fluorescent-labeled cells experienced the crossover
frequency at 8–10 kHz, whereas the label-free cells exhibited
at 16–18 kHz.

1 Introduction
In
the late 19th century, the discovery of organic fluorescent
compounds provided an avenue for capturing the dynamic processes of
living organisms. Various fluorescent dyes have been developed. They
have become essential tools for powerful techniques ranging from live-cell
fluorescence imaging to flow cytometry, with various applications
including the detection of substances, the tracking of single molecules,
and the visualization of post-translational modifications.1−7 Although label-free assays that exclude phenotypic and genetic modifications
might be more suitable for many life sciences and medical applications,
fluorescent dyes remain one of the most valuable tools for current
state-of-the-art assays and technologies. Various fluorescent dyes
have been developed with improved sensitivity, selectivity, specificity,
detection speed, repeatability, photostability, brightness, and biocompatibility.1,2,8,9 Modern
biotechnological tools in conjunction with these better-quality fluorescent
dyes will play a significant role in understanding cellular and subcellular
dynamics in the near future as well.

This study presents the
dielectrophoretic behavior of pre- and
postlabeled single cells when stained with commercially available
fluorescent dyes. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is one of the label-free
characterization methods that directly and quantitatively determine
whether or not fluorescent dyes alter the intrinsic properties of
the cells. Herbert Pohl introduced the DEP phenomenon in the 1950s
as the motion of an electrically polarizable particle in a nonuniform
electric field.10,11 The dielectrophoretic force depends
on the permittivity of the suspending medium of the cells (εm), the radius of the cell (r), the real part
of the Clausius–Mossotti factor (fCM), and the applied electric field (E), as represented
in eq 1. 1  

The Clausius–Mossotti factor is defined as in eq 2, where εc* is the complex permittivity of
the cell, and εm* is the complex permittivity of the medium. 2  

The complex permittivity (ε*) depends on permittivity (ε),
conductivity (σ) of the cell/medium, and frequency (f) of the electric field (E), as expressed
in eq 3, where j shows the imaginary number . 3  

When Re[fCM] > 0, the strong electric
field regions attract the cells, and they are influenced by “positive
DEP (pDEP)”; when the cells are repelled from the high field
strength, they are designated “negative DEP (nDEP)”.
Both the pDEP and nDEP behavior of the cells rely on their polarizability
difference with respect to their surrounding medium. When the polarizability
difference between the cells and their surrounding medium is almost
negligible, the DEP forces become very weak, to almost zero. This
specific frequency is known as “crossover frequency”,
which determines the dielectrophoretic characteristics of the cells.12−15

Since the 1950s, many new DEP tools and methods with improved
sensitivity,
throughput, and practical usage have been developed.16−20 Here, we used the three-dimensional (3D) carbon-electrode DEP, which
was introduced by Dr. Martinez-Duarte and his colleagues. It has been
previously used in a variety of cell separation applications including
bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells.13−15,21

In this study, we investigated the dielectrophoretic effect
of
two different commercially available membrane-permeant reactive tracer
dyes (The CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate)
and CellTracker Red CMTPX (Fisher Scientific) on U937, the (pro-)
monocytic, human myeloid leukemia cell line (ATCC CRL 1593.2). As
these two dyes are well-suited and widely studied not only for being
easy to use but also adequate for monitoring the behavior of cells,
cell location or movement, and long-term cell tracking thanks to retaining
in the living cells through several generations. Besides, multiplexing
green and red fluorescent dyes allows the observation of cell–cell
communication and protein expressions without cross-contamination.
Although these dyes were studied for their cytotoxicity, stability,
and other chemical properties, according to our knowledge, investigation
on the dielectrophoretic properties of these commercially available
fluorescent cell tracker dyes have not been performed yet.22,23

2 Results and Discussion
U937 cells were cultured
in an RPMI (Rosewell Park Memorial Institute,
Sigma-Aldrich) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1% Pen/Strep (penicillin–streptomycin, Sigma-Aldrich) in
75 cm2 flasks (Corning T-75 flasks) in an incubator (NUVE
EC160), in which 37 °C, 5% CO2, and humidity were
maintained. The CellTracker Green CMFDA and CellTracker Red CMTPX
dyes were used to prepare a 1 μM staining solution in fresh
RPMI medium. Complementing the fluorescent dyes into the medium did
not change the conductivity of the medium. The number of U937 monocyte
cells was adjusted to 1 × 105 cells/mL using a hemocytometer
(Marienfeld). Next, the cells were cultured in the staining solution
in the incubator for 30 min. Then, the stained cells were harvested
at 3000 rpm (Hettich EBA 20 centrifuge) for 5 min to remove any residual
dye in the culture media. Afterward, the cells were resuspended in
a low-conductive DEP buffer twice. The DEP buffer was prepared using
8.6% sucrose (BioFroxx), 0.3% glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.1% bovine
serum albumin (PAN Biotech) in deionized (DI) water. The conductivity
of the DEP buffer was measured as 20 μS/cm using a conductivity
meter (Corning, 311 conductivity).

The dielectrophoretic setup
consists of a function generator, an
upright, optical microscope integrated with a camera, a computer,
a syringe pump, and the 3D carbon-DEP device. There are two 20–200
μL pipette tips at the inlet and outlet of the electrode-array
microchannel to create reservoirs. The Tygon tubing connects the syringe
and the microchannel in the system.

The dielectrophoretic characterization
of label-free and stained
U937 monocyte cells was performed using the experimental setup illustrated
in Figure 1. First,
the 3D carbon-DEP chip was sterilized by flowing 70% ethanol and then
DI water prior to the experiments. Next, the bubbles inside the microchannel
were removed and the chip was filled with the low-conductive DEP buffer.
The cells were prepared as explained above and introduced into the
chip with a 10 μL/min flow rate using the syringe pump (New
Era Pump Systems, Inc., NE-1000). When the cells reached the region
of the carbon electrodes, the flow was stopped. The cells were settled
when a signal with 10 Vpp at frequencies between 1 kHz
and 20 MHz was applied from the function generator (INSTEK—GFG-8216A).
After the DEP exposure, the cells were collected from the device into
a collection tube for further inspection. A Nikon Eclipse, an upright
optical microscope with 10× objective, was used to capture videos
with 1 frame/s frame rate during the experiments (Figure 2).

setup.

carbon electrode array.
Green arrows show the cells, black circles are the carbon electrodes,
and black lines are the connection wires of the electrodes.

The obtained videos were analyzed
as demonstrated in Figure 3 and detailed in the previous
studies of Dr. Martinez-Duarte and co-workers.24−26 The location
of the cells at each frame was rated as strong nDEP (−3), nDEP
(−2), weak nDEP (−1), crossover (0), weak pDEP (1),
pDEP (2), or strong pDEP (3) according to their positions with respect
to the carbon electrodes.

the 3D carbon-electrode
microchip that represents the DEP regions, according to the captured
image in Figure 2.

Figures 4 and 5 show the obtained
dielectrophoretic behavior of
the label-free U937 monocytes. The monocytes were stained with CellTracker
Red and CellTracker Green dyes. To delineate whether the applied fluorescent
dyes affect the DEP characteristics of the cells, dielectrophoretic
forces were applied between 1 kHz and 20 MHz at 10 Vpp in
the 3D carbon-DEP chip. As there was no drag force because of the
fluid flow in the system, the translational movement of the cells
was due to the exhibited DEP forces (eq 1). Next, the location of the cells was correlated with
their DEP responses. The position of each cell was traced in each
frame using the obtained movies (Supporting Movie). ImageJ was used to analyze the captured images. The mean value
of the positions of the cells with standard deviations at each frequency
was calculated using the Prism software (GraphPad).

stained with CellTracker Red (white circles),
CellTracker Green (black circles), and DEP response of unlabeled monocytes
(star). A total of 50 cells were tracked from 1 to 30 kHz at 10 Vpp.

frequency from 1 to 30 kHz at 10 Vpp. The red lines show

3 Conclusions
Fluorescent
dyes have been widely used as tremendous tools for
cell labeling in a wide variety of applications of life sciences and
medicine, such as monitoring chemotaxis and invasion, tracking cell
movement and migration, and quantifying proliferation. They are easy
to use and compatible with several assays. Their fluorescent signal
is retained in living cells through several generations. For these
dyes, most of the conventional characterization assays and methods
quantify their sensitivity, selectivity, brightness, photostability,
specificity, toxicity, and photochemical properties. As most of the
fluorescent dyes are capable of penetrating through the cell membrane,
passing into the cytoplasm, and being impermeant, we investigated
whether the fluorescent dyes change the permittivity and conductivity
of the cells that may influence the dielectric properties of the cells.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates
the dielectrophoretic properties of commercially available fluorescent
cell tracker dyes. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, there is a slight shift
in the crossover frequencies of the cells when they are labeled with
membrane-permeant reactive tracers. This minor variation might be
negligible for many applications; nevertheless, it might be significant
for the dielectrophoretic separation of cells that exhibit very close
dielectrophoretic responses at single-cell resolution.
