Capacitors allow extremely fast charge and discharge
operations,
which is a challenge faced by recent metal-ion batteries despite having
highly improved energy densities. Thus, combined type electric energy
storage devices that can integrate high energy density and high power
density with high potentials, can overcome the shortcomings of the
current metal-ion batteries and capacitors. However, the limited capacities
of cathode materials owing to the barren redox reactions are regarded
as an obstacle for the development of future high-performance hybrid
metal-ion capacitors. In this study, we demonstrate the redox-reaction-rendering
effect of the much overlooked lanthanide elements when used as the
cathode of lithium-ion capacitors using the mesoporous carbon (MC)
as a matrix material. Consequently, these lanthanide elements can
effectively enrich the redox reaction, thus improving the capacity
of the matrix materials by more than two times. Typically, the Gd-elemental
decoration of MC surprisingly enhances the capacity by almost two
times as compared with the underacted MC. Furthermore, the La nanoparticles
(NPs) decoration depicts the same behavior. Evident redox peaks were
formed on the original rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves.
This study provides the first example of embedding lanthanide elements
on matrix materials to enrich the desired redox reactions for improving
the electrochemical performances.

Introduction
The integration of renewable- and sustainable-energy
resources
into electric grids is considered as a promising approach for solving
the energy crisis caused by the limited quantities of fossil fuels.1−4 However, intermediate energy-storage devices are required for balancing
and stabilizing green energy due to its instability.5−11 Electrochemical batteries exhibit a significant potential to assist
in this crucial coupling operation. Thus far, there have been extensive
advancements in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as compared to other
parallel metal–ion batteries.12−20 However, there are still a few challenges associated with the use
of LIBs, namely, the unmatched energy and power densities. The energy
densities of LIBs have been highly improved using diverse design strategies
for anode and cathode materials.21−23 However, the power densities
of LIBs are still limited due to the poor electronic and ionic conductivities
of the active materials. Capacitors are suitable to meet high power
density requirements and overcome these challenges. However, traditional
capacitors function on charge gathering and releasing, thereby limiting
the capacitances. These aspects of metal-ion batteries and capacitors
indicate that they can provide a solution for each other’s
limitations and address the current electronic-energy storage issues.

Hybrid capacitors constructed using battery-type anodes and capacitor-type
cathodes gradually achieve a promising combination of both high energy
and power densities. The current researches on this type of electronic
storage devices mainly focus on the exploration of anode materials
to achieve both high capacities and rate performances.24−26 Most of the current cathode material used in hybrid capacitors is
activated carbon, although other types of functionalized carbon-based
materials have also been reported.27,28 Mesoporous
carbon (MC) is one of the highly porous and cost-efficient materials,
and it is, in principle, quite suitable as a cathode material in hybrid
capacitors. However, bare MC materials endow very limited capacitances.
Therefore, the further engineering of mesoporous is necessary to have
more redox-active sites for achieving Faradic pseudocapacitance. The
introduction of redox reactions requires alterable valance states
to integrate foreign electrons and ions.

Accordingly, lanthanide
elements have rich unpaired electrons and
special orbital structures, along with the capabilities of multiple
valances. Among these elements, gadolinium (Gd) has seven unpaired
electrons in the 4f orbital and one unpaired electron in the 6p orbital.
On the contrary, lanthanum (La) has a single unpaired electron in
the 6p orbital. Their salts are well soluble and stable trivalent-ion
states in the solution. Based on our previously conducted report,29 the Gd-based Prussian-blue analogue contributes
to highly improved capacity for Li-ion capacitors as compared to other
carbon-based cathode materials for hybrid capacitors. Motivated by
these advantages of often-overlooked lanthanide elements, in this
study, we demonstrated the lanthanide elements rendered redox reactions
for MC when used as cathode materials in hybrid lithium-ion capacitors.
Typically, we doped Gd and La on the MC via a wet-chemical method
using the water-soluble reductant NaBH4.30−32 As a result,
the desired redox peaks were generated clearly on cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves. By deriving benefits from both the effective redox reactions
of lanthanide elements and the capacitive-type Li+-ion
storage property of mesoporous C, three times enhancement in the capacity
values is achieved, along with an extremely long cyclic stability,
as compared with that of the bare mesoporous C.

Results and Discussion
The CV measurement of the MC
was performed (Figure 1). A rectangular CV curve with a single redox
peak at 3.44
V vs Li+/Li in the charging process illustrates the capacitive
Li+-ion-storage mechanism in the voltage range of 2 V vs
Li+/Li. Correspondingly, the repeated charge–discharge
measurement indicates the capacity values of approximately 8 mAh/g
with excellent Coulombic efficiencies approaching 100%. The unit of
capacity here is identified as that of the electrodes used for batteries
rather than that of double-layer super capacitors or of Faradic pseudocapacitors.
The linear charge–discharge voltage profiles in Figure S1 illustrate the capacitive Li+-ion-storage process. In addition, the consecutive evolution of the
voltage profiles is depicted in Figure S2, in which, steady charge and discharge processes are illustrated.

curve and (b) repeated charge–discharge cycling measurements
of bare mesoporous C used as the cathode of lithium-ion capacitor.

Furthermore, we enhance the capacities of MC by
decorating the
lanthanide elements (Gd and La). From the results of X-ray diffraction
(XRD) phase identification (Figures 2a,d and S3a), the absence
of both Gd and La metallic or oxide peaks suggests the small particle
sizes of the loaded species. Furthermore, the D band and the G band
from the MC component are identified from its Raman spectra (Figure 2b,e). The D band
(A1g mode) and the G band (E2g mode) reveal
both amorphous and crystalline carbon atoms, which is similar to the
bare MC (Figure S3b). These results further
suggest that the introduction of lanthanide elements has slight effect
on the MC matrix. From the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results
(Figures 2c,f and S3c), stable thermal plateaus are achieved for
both the products after the initial evaporation of water molecules.
Furthermore, the MC/Gd shows a greater amount of residual water species
than that in MC/La. The stable thermal stability (Figure S3c) in the bare MC sample further suggests the introduced
water molecules after synthesis process.

and (d) MC/La. Raman spectra of (b) MC/Gd
and (e) MC/La. TGA curves of (c) MC/Gd and (f) MC/La.

Subsequently, the small MC/Gd and MC/La particles
were observed
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (Figure 3). Similar small composite particles are shown in SEM and
TEM images (Figure 3a,e). The particle size measured from the TEM images (Figure 3b,f) was approximately 50 nm.
The Gd or La is decorated on the MC, as determined from the energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) mapping results (Figure 3c,d,g,h). Furthermore, Gd and La were loaded uniformly
on the MC because of the reductant NaBH4 by taking the
benefit of surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).

and (f) MC/La. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images

The loaded Gd and La are further demonstrated by
the X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS), in which the C species is clearly shown in the wide
survey and the deconvoluted spectra (Figure 4a,b,e,f). The intense O 1s signal is released
mainly from the absorbed water molecules. The successful loading of
La on MC is confirmed by the intense deconvoluted La 3d peaks at the
binding energies of 834 and 851 eV in the MC/La sample.33 Furthermore, for the Gd in MC/Gd, a big hump
is obtained, which only preliminarily confirms the existence of Gd
but not the existing states.

1s, (c) O 1s, and
(d) Gd 3d. XPS spectra of MC/La: (e) wide survey, (f) C 1s, (g) O

Our aim is to improve the capacity values of the
MC by the decoration
or introduction of lanthanide elements. Thus, the CV curves are scanned,
in which, a pair of redox peaks are clearly formed on both the CV
curves (Figure 5).
A reduction peak at 2.79 V vs Li+/Li and an oxidation peak
at 3.44 V vs Li+/Li, with a hysteresis-voltage range of
0.65 V vs Li+/Li, are exhibited for MC/Gd. However, for
MC/La, a reduction peak at 2.85 V vs Li+/Li and an oxidation
peak at 3.3 V vs Li+/Li with a narrower hysteresis voltage
window of 0.45 V vs Li+/Li are exhibited. After the decoration
of these two lanthanide elements, an additive redox process is introduced
in the MC, thereby expecting to modify the electrochemical capacity
toward Li+-ion storage.

Figure 5 CV curves of (a) MC/Gd and (b) MC/La as
a cathode material of lithium-ion
capacitors.

The electrochemical capacity values are measured
using multiple
strategies (Figure 6). From the rate-performance results, a highly improved Li+-ion-storage capability is obtained, with electrochemical capacities
of approximately 25 and 28 mAh/g for MC/La and MC/Gd, respectively,
at 100 mA/g, both of which are much higher than those of bare MC (9
mAh/g) (Figure 6a).
Furthermore, excellent Coulombic efficiencies are obtained for both
MC/Gd and MC/La at various current densities. A higher capacity retention
of 53% for MC/Gd and 26% for MC/La are also obtained after enhancing
the current density to 1000 mA/g. This can be further explained by
the electrochemical-impedance measurements (Figure S4a,b). Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) curves depict a depressed semicircle (charge transfer) and an
oblique line (mass transfer).34,35 The EIS curves were
further analyzed by incorporating a corresponding equivalent circuit
(Figure S4c). In these, the internal resistance
(Rs ∼ 50 Ω) corresponding
to the electrode resistance, electrolyte resistance, electrode/current
collector contact resistance, and current-collector resistance are
depicted. As a sequence, charge-transfer resistances (Rct) of approximately 200 Ω for MC/Gd and 400 Ω
for MC/La are also depicted. The underlying charge–discharge
voltage profiles are recorded in Figure 6c,d, in which a pair of evident voltage plateaus
is displayed at approximately 3.5 V vs Li+/Li upon increasing
the current density from 100 to 1000 mA/g. These results highly suggest
the rendering effect toward the redox reactions using the lanthanide
elements to effectively promote the electrochemical performances.
Afterward, a more realistic consideration has been provided. In the
practical utilization, one-time fast charge for a long-term application
is crucial, making it necessary to demonstrate the cathode materials
in a manner of fast charge and discharge at various current densities.
Thus, based on the corresponding results in Figure 6b, the capacity values of approximately 8
mAh/g for MC/Gd and 6 mAh/g for MC/La, both at 100 mA/g, are retained.
Meanwhile, the capacity values of 7 mAh/g for MC/Gd and 5 mAh/g for
MC/La are retained after increasing the current density up to 1000
mA/g with Coulombic efficiencies of both approaching 100%. Furthermore,
the consecutive charge–discharge measurements are performed
at 100 mA/g for both MC/Gd and MC/La. The highly improved capacities
are steadily maintained (25 mAh/g for MC/Gd and 20 mAh/g for MC/La
at the 100th cycle) with excellent Coulombic efficiencies of both
approaching 100% (Figure S5).

Figure 6 (a) Rate performances
of MC/Gd and MC/La at various current densities
(100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mA/g). (b) Rate properties of MC/Gd
and MC/La at the constant current density of 1000 mA/g for fast charging
and diverse discharge current densities of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800,

and (d) MC/La at different current densities. Repeated charge–discharge

Long-term application is significant for the cathode
materials
used in practical devices. We, therefore, measure the long-term, repeated
charge–discharge cycling at both 1000 and 10 000 mA/g
(Figure 6e,f). As a
result, it exhibits quite stable long-term charge/discharge performances.

After consecutive charge–discharge measurements, we further
investigated the electrodes. A similar electrode morphology having
a highly porous structure was exhibited. Furthermore, the decorated
nanoparticles on the MC were observed in the TEM images (Figure S6). This observation confirmed the well
integrity of the composite materials, together with the EDX mapping
results in Figure S7 in which the elements
were detected satisfactorily.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated the redox
reaction rendering by introducing
lanthanide elements. The MC was employed as a reference and host/support
material. After the decoration of lanthanide elements via a facile
wet-chemical method, together with using CTAB as a surfactant, even
the slightly small sized particles Gd and La particles could be loaded
on the MC. Meanwhile, these lanthanide elements could also effectively
enrich the redox reaction, thus improving the capacity of the matrix
materials. Typically, the Gd-elemental decoration of MC surprisingly
enhanced the capacity by almost two times than that of the bare MC.
In addition, the La nanoparticles (NPs) decoration depicted the same
behavior. This study provides the first example of embedding lanthanide
elements on matrix materials to render the desired redox reactions,
for improving the electrochemical performances.

Experimental Section
Material Preparation
First, 0.5 g of MC (699632-5G,
0.342 cm3/g (pore size), 150–250 m2/g
(surface area)), and 0.1 g of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB,
219374-100GM) were dissolved in a 30 mL aqueous solution containing
10 mL ethanol additive, followed by ultrasonication. CTAB is an efficient
surfactant that can provide a mild environment for the nanoparticle
loading. Subsequently, 0.01 moles each of gadolinium (III) nitrate
hexahydrate (211591-25G) and lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (203548-25G)
were dissolved separately in 10 mL of aqueous solutions. After the
ultrasonication of both solutions for 1 h, we mixed the lanthanide-element
containing solutions separately into the previously prepared MC solution,
followed by constant stirring. Following this, a 0.2 M NaBH4 solution was added to it. NaBH4 is a low-cost and widely
used reductant that provides sufficient reductant agent. After the
NaBH4 (71320-25G)-induced reduction process, the suspended
species were rinsed using copious amount of water and dried in an
oven at 60 °C.

Characterizations
Physical Characterizations
The phases were studied
by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer.
The surface chemical performances of the final products were determined
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Al Kα source
(PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Japan). Furthermore, Raman spectra were gathered
using LabRAM HR Evolution and Nicolet iS50. Field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SUPRA 55VP) was utilized for verifying
the compositions and morphologies of the synthesized samples. Transmission
electron microscopy connected with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer
(TEM, JEOL JEM-F200) was performed for studying decoration and morphology.
The thermal stability of the as-prepared GdHCCo was probed by means
of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at the rate of 10 °C/min
from 25 to 700 °C under an N2-flow condition. Furthermore,
quantitative elemental analysis was achieved by means of X-ray fluorescence
(XRF, ZSX-PRIMUS).

Electrode Preparation
A slurry was prepared by mixing
and grinding the bare MC, carbon black (Super P Li), and poly(vinylidene
difluoride) in the weight ratio of 7:2:1. Subsequently, the mixed
powder was dried for 8 h at 80 °C in a vacuum oven, followed
by redispersing it into N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone.
The weight of samples was measured before and after the drying to
ensure the water evaporation as much as possible. A working electrode
was prepared using a loading amount of approximately 3 mg/cm2 on an Al-foil current collector by spreading the slurry and, subsequently,
drying it in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Similar methods were also
used for preparing the electrodes that contained MC/Gd and MC/La products
by only changing the MC into MC/Gd and MC/La, respectively.

Electrochemical Characterization
A two-electrode-type
cell comprising the working electrode as an MC or MC/Gd or MC/La,
and sufficient Li-metal foil to ensure that capacity was restricted
only by the product materials, was prepared in a 1.0 M mixture of
LiPF6 with diethylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate
(1:1, v/v) in an Ar-filled glovebox. The redox activities were determined
by means of CV curves using an electrochemical workstation (WBCS3000,
Wonatech, Korea). The employed potential range was 2.2–4.5
V vs Li+/Li at the rate of 0.5 mV/s. In addition, the galvanostatic
charge/discharge was achieved between the same potential range of
2.2–4.5 V vs Li+/Li under various specific currents
of 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 10 000 mA/g. The all-specific
capacities and current densities were calculated on the basis of the
total weight of MC or MC/Gd or MC/La. Furthermore, the electrochemical-impedance-spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements (IM6ex ZAHNER Elektrik) were performed at a frequency
range of 10 mHz to 1 MHz under an amplitude of 10 mV.

Ex Situ Characterizations
Ex situ characterizations
were performed to investigate the decorated Gd and La elements after
cycling measurements. The measured half-cells were disassembled, followed
by thoroughly rinsing the working electrode materials in an Ar-filled
glovebox. After being vacuum dried for 8 h, the electrode materials
were subjected to ex situ TEM and SEM characterizations.
