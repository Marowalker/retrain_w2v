Complexes [Ag(H2BzPh)NO3] (1), [Ag(H2BzpCH3Ph)NO3] (2), [Ag(H2BzpClPh)NO3] (3), and [Ag(H2BzpNO2Ph)NO3] (4) were
synthesized with 2-benzoylpyridine benzoylhydrazone (H2BzPh) and its para-methyl-benzoylhydrazone (H2BzpCH3Ph), para-chloro-benzoylhydrazone (H2BzpClPh), and para-nitro-benzoylhydrazone
(H2BzpNO2Ph) derivatives. Experimental
data indicate that the nitrate ligand binds more strongly to the silver
center through one of the oxygen atoms, whereas the second oxygen
atom from nitrate and the hydrazone oxygen makes much weaker interactions
with the metal. Dissociation of nitrate most probably occurs in solution
and in biological media. Interestingly, theoretical calculations suggested
that when dissociation of the nitrate takes place, all bond orders
involving the metal and the atoms from the hydrazone ligand increase
significantly, showing that the bonding of nitrate results in the
weakening of all other interactions in the metal coordination sphere.
Upon complexation of the hydrazones to silver(I), cytotoxicity against
B16F10 metastatic murine melanoma cells increased in all cases. Complexes
(1–3) proved to be more cytotoxic than cisplatin.
All compounds were more cytotoxic to B16F10 cells than to nontumorigenic
murine Melan-A melanocyte cells. Interestingly, the selectivity index
(SI = IC50 non-malignant cells/IC50 tumor cells) of complex (1), SI =
23, was much higher than that of the parent hydrazone ligand, SI =
9.5. Studies on the interactions of complexes (1–3) with DNA suggested that although (1–3) interact
with calf thymus DNA by an intercalative mode, direct covalent binding
of silver(I) to DNA probably does not occur. Complexes (1–3) interact in vitro with human serum albumin indicating that these
compounds could be transported by albumin.

Introduction
Hydrazones
and their metal complexes exhibit numerous pharmacological
applications as antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and
cytotoxic agents. 2-Benzoylpyridine-derived hydrazones present cytotoxic
activity against several tumor cell lines.1−3 In previous
works, we demonstrated that upon coordination of these hydrazones
to bismuth(III)3 and gallium(III),4 the cytotoxic effects against leukemia and solid
tumor cells were improved in comparison to the free ligands.

Silver compounds are well-known for their pharmacological applications
as antiseptic, antimicrobial, and an anti-inflammatory agents.5 Silver sulfadiazine is used worldwide in the
treatment of skin infections in burns and wounds,6 although some disadvantages of silver sulfadiazine such
as its cytotoxic effect on epidermal cells have been reported in recent
years.7 Silver(I) complexes with different
ligands proved to present antimicrobial properties.8−11 In addition, silver(I) complexes
have become attractive as anticancer therapeutic drug candidates because
of their antiproliferative activity and selectivity against numerous
cancer cells.9,12,13

Considering the high cytotoxic activity of 2-benzoylpyridine-derived
hydrazones previously investigated by us against neoplastic cells,
in the present work, silver(I) complexes were synthesized with 2-benzoylpyridine
benzoylhydrazone (H2BzPh) as well as with its para-methyl-benzoylhydrazone (H2BzpCH3Ph), para-chloro-benzoylhydrazone (H2BzpClPh),
and para-nitro-benzoylhydrazone (H2BzpNO2Ph) analogues (Figure 1). The cytotoxic effects of the complexes under study
were evaluated on B16F10 metastatic melanoma and against nonmalignant
Melan-A melanocyte cells. The interactions of the compounds with DNA
and with human serum albumin (HSA) were investigated as well.

Results and Discussion
Formation of the Silver(I)
Complexes
Microanalyses
are compatible with the formation of [Ag(H2BzPh)NO3] (1), [Ag(H2BzpCH3Ph)NO3] (2), [Ag(H2BzpClPh)NO3] (3), and [Ag(H2BzpNO2Ph)NO3] (4), in which a hydrazone ligand is attached
to the silver(I) center together with a nitrate ion. The relatively
high molar conductivities in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) suggest the
probable release of nitrate in solution. In fact, crystal structure
determinations of (1–3) and theoretical studies
(see Supporting Information) are in accordance
with a loosely bound nitrate ligand in all complexes (1–4).

Spectroscopic Characterization
Infrared Spectra
The vibrations assigned to ν(N–H)
at 3283–3275 cm–1 in the infrared spectra
of the hydrazones are observed at 3354–3216 cm–1 in the spectra of complexes (1–4). The ν(C=N)
vibration at 1610–1600 cm–1 in the spectra
of the hydrazones are noticed at 1610–1594 cm–1 in those of complexes (1–4), indicating coordination
of the azomethine nitrogen.4 The ν(C=O)
absorption at 1686–1650 cm–1 in the spectra
of the hydrazones shifts to 1678–1660 cm–1 in complexes (1–4). The in-plane deformation
mode of the pyridine ring at 614–628 cm–1 in the spectra of the free hydrazones shifts to 630–623 cm–1 in complexes (1–4), suggesting
complexation of the heteroaromatic nitrogen.4 In addition, the vibration attributed to the nitrate group ν(NO3) was observed at 1384 cm–1 and the ν(Ag(I)–O)
vibration mode was found at 544–516 cm–1 in
the spectra of complexes (1–4).14,15

NMR Spectra
The NMR spectra of the hydrazones and their
silver(I) complexes (1–3) were recorded in DMSO-d6. Because complex (4) undergoes
ligand release in DMSO-d6, its NMR spectra
were not recorded. The 1H resonances were assigned based
on chemical shifts, multiplicities, and by using two-dimensional (2D)
homonuclear 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy.
The carbon type (C, CH) was determined employing distortionless enhancement
by polarization transfer (DEPT 135) experiments and the attributions
were made by means of 2D heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence
and heteronuclear multiple bond coherence experiments.

In the 1H NMR spectra of the hydrazones, all signals were duplicated,
indicating the existence of the Z and E configurational isomers in DMSO-d6 solution.
In the first, N3–H is hydrogen-bonded to the pyridine nitrogen
(δ 14.75–14.72), whereas in the latter, N3–H is
hydrogen-bonded to the solvent (δ 10.37–10.04).4,16 The signals of all carbons are also duplicated in the 13C NMR spectra of the hydrazones, according to the presence of the Z and E isomeric forms in solution.3

In the spectra of complexes (1–3), only one
signal was observed for each hydrogen and each carbon, consistent
with the presence of only one isomer in solution. The signal of N3–H
at δ 11.40–11.14 is characteristic of the E configuration. The signals of C7 and C8 undergo substantial shifts
on coordination, in accordance with complexation through the imine
nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen. The signals of the pyridine carbons
also undergo significant shifts upon complexation, indicating coordination
through the heteroaromatic nitrogen. Interestingly, theoretical studies
(see Supporting Information) suggested
a strengthening of the silver(I)–oxygen (from the hydrazone)
bond upon release of the nitrate ligand in solution, which is compatible
with the observed shifting of the C8=O signal in the spectra
of the complexes in comparison to those of the free hydrazone ligands.

a Ag···O interaction.

In complexes (1–3), the distances and angles
in the hydrazone skeleton are similar. However, comparison of the
bond distances in H2BzpClPh4 and in complex (3) reveals substantial changes due
to complexation.

In (1–3), a hydrazone ligand
is attached to
the silver(I) center together with a nitrate ion. In all complexes,
the Ag1···O1 [2.6048(15) (1), 2.7110(19)
(2), and 2.632(2) (3)] and Ag1···O3
[2.6331(19) (1), 2.774(2) (2), and 2.739(3)
(3)] distances are longer than the Ag–O2 bond
lengths [2.3565(19) (1), 2.2789(19) (2),
and 2.286(3) (3)]. Therefore, weaker interactions were
found between the metal center and the hydrazone carbonyl oxygen and
between the metal center and O3 from the nitrate than between the
silver(I) center and O2 from the nitrate. This effect is consistent
with the high molar conductivities of complexes (1–3), which might be due to the release of the loosely bound nitrate
ligand in solution.

Cytotoxic
Activity
The cytotoxic effects of the hydrazones
and their silver(I) complexes (1–3) were evaluated
in comparison with cisplatin on B16F10 (metastatic melanoma) and Melan-A
(nontumorigenic melanocyte) cells by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay (Table 2). Upon coordination
to silver(I), the cytotoxic activities against B16F10 cells increased
in all cases. Complexes (1–3) proved to be more
cytotoxic than cisplatin and silver nitrate. All compounds revealed
to be more cytotoxic to B16F10 cells than to the nonmalignant Melan-A
cells. Interestingly, the selectivity index (SI = IC50 non-malignant cells/IC50 tumor cells) of complex (1), SI = 23, was much higher than that of the parent hydrazone ligand,
SI = 9.5.

DNA Binding Studies
The electronic spectra of complexes
(1–3) were registered in the absence and in the
presence of increasing concentrations of calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA).
Upon addition of DNA, a slight hypochromism and a small bathochromic
shift were noticed at the wavelength of maximum absorption (Figure 3a), indicating intercalative
binding. Hypochromism probably occurs due to π-stacking interactions
between aromatic groups and the DNA base pairs, as in the case of
classical intercalators such as ethidium bromide (EB).17

Figure 3 (a) Electronic absorption spectra of [Ag(H2BzPh)NO3]
(1) in the absence (black line) and in the presence (color
lines) of increasing amounts of CT-DNA. The arrows show the changes
upon addition of increasing amounts of CT-DNA. (b) Scatchard plots
of [DNA]/(εa – εf) vs [DNA].
([DNA] = 0–20 μM, [complexes] = 30 μM at 25 °C
in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2).

With the purpose to quantitatively compare the binding strength,
the intrinsic binding constants (Kb) of
(1–3) with CT-DNA were determined as previously
described.18 As shown in Figure 3b, the plot of [DNA]/[εa – εf ] versus [DNA] gives 1/[εb – εf ] as the slope and 1/(Kb[εb – εf ]) as the intercept. [DNA] is the concentration of DNA base pairs,
εa is the molar absorption coefficient of the complex
at a given DNA concentration, and εf and εb are the molar absorption coefficients of the complex unbound
and completely bound to DNA, respectively.

The intrinsic binding
constant Kb is
determined as the ratio between the slope and the intercept. The calculated Kb values are shown in Table 3. All complexes presented Kb values on the order of 105 M–1.

Competitive binding experiments were performed
to obtain further
information on the interactions of complexes (1–3) with DNA. Figure 4a represents the emission spectra of EB bound to DNA in the absence
and presence of complex (1). Upon excitation at 545 nm,
the EB–DNA system exhibits a strong emission at 602 nm. A decrease
in the emission intensity was found in the presence of complexes (1–3), probably due to the reduction in the number of
binding sites on DNA accessible to EB.

spectra (λexc = 545
nm) for EB–DNA in the absence (black line) and presence (color

concentrations of (1). (b) Stern–Volmer plots
of relative EB–DNA fluorescence intensity F0/F vs [complex] for complexes (1–3). ([complexes] = 0–100 μM,
[DNA] = 10 μM, and [EB] = 10 μM).

The spectral modifications suggest that the complexes interact
with DNA, at least in part by an atypical intercalating process.19 The apparent binding constants (Kapp) for complexes (1–3) were calculated
as previously reported18 from the equation KEB[EB] = Kapp[complex],
where KEB is 1.0 × 107 M–1, [EB] = 10 μM, and [complex] is the
complex concentration when the fluorescence intensity of EB is 50%
of the initial fluorescence. This value is obtained from the plot F0/F versus [complex] when F0/F = 2 (Figure 4b, Table 3). The determined Kapp values
are similar to that reported for the antineoplastic intercalating
agent actinomycin D (Kapp = 9.69 ×
105 M–1).20

The effects of the hydrazone ligands, complexes (1–3), AgNO3, and cisplatin on DNA conformation were evaluated
by the analyses of the electrophoretic mobility of pUC19 plasmid DNA
after interaction with the compounds (Figure 5). At the employed concentration (100 μM),
the hydrazone ligands, AgNO3, and complexes (1–3) did not interact with DNA. At the same concentration, cisplatin
significantly interacted with DNA, hindering its electrophoretic mobility.

Albumin Binding Studies
The literature
reports that
most chemotherapeutic compounds bind to site I (located on IIA subdomain)
and site II (located on IIIA subdomain) on HSA.21 Interactions on site I can be monitored by investigating
the fluorescent properties of the tryptophan residue (Trp-214) located
in the IIA subdomain. Fluorescence spectra using λex ≥ 295 nm are due entirely to this residue.22

The emission spectra of HSA were recorded at 298
K in the absence and in the presence of several concentrations of
complex (1) (Figure 6a). HSA shows strong emission at 342 nm (excitation
at 295 nm). By increasing the concentration of (1), a
reduction of the fluorescence maximum together with a shift to 335
nm were noticed, suggesting the presence of a more hydrophobic environment
around the Trp-214 residue upon formation of the HSA–(1) system.23 Similar behaviors
were observed for complexes (2) and (3).

spectra of HSA (1.84 μM, λex = 295 nm) with
increasing concentrations of [Ag(H2BzPh)NO3] (1) (0–6 μM) at 298 K. The arrows indicate
the spectral changes. (b) Stern–Volmer plots of F0/F vs [complex] for the binding between

binding constants (Kb) and number of active
sites (n) at different temperatures. (d) van’t
Hoff plots of ln K vs 1/T for the
binding silver(I) complexes (1–3) with HSA.

On the basis of the fluorescence
intensity at λem = 342 nm, the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant (Ksv) and the bimolecular
quenching rate constant (Kq) were calculated
employing the Stern–Volmer eq 1.24,25 1  where F0 and F are the
fluorescence intensities of HSA in the absence
and in the presence of the quencher, respectively, Ksv is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant (M–1), kq is the bimolecular
quenching rate constant (M–1 s–1), τ0 is the emission lifetime of the fluorescent
biomolecule in the absence of the quencher (τ0 =
10–8 s),26 and [Q] is
the concentration of the quencher [Q] = [complex]. According to eq 2: 2  Ksv is determined
as the slope of the plot of F0/F versus [complex] (Figure 6b). The binding constant (Kb) and the number of binding sites (n) are calculated
by means of eq 3 3  where Kb is the
binding constant of the quencher with HSA, n is the
number of binding sites, and F0 and F are the fluorescence intensity in the absence and the
presence of the quencher, Q. The plot of log[(F0 – F)/F] versus log[complex]
gives n and Kb as the
slope and the intercept, respectively (Figure 6c).

The calculated Stern–Volmer
quenching constants (Table 4) correlate inversely
with temperature. Kq values on the order
of 1012 M–1 s–1 were
higher than typical diffusion-controlled quenching rates of molecules
in aqueous medium, 2.0 × 1010 M–1 s–1.24 Therefore, the
fluorescence quenching did not result from dynamic collisions but
it might have been provoked by a specific interaction between HSA
and complexes (1–3), consistent with a static
quenching mechanism. The binding constants decreased with increasing
temperature, resulting from a decrease in the stability of the HSA–Ag(I)
system. The n values close to 1 indicate that the
complexes bind HSA in 1:1 molar ratio.

The nature of the forces that direct the interactions with HSA
can be inferred from the analysis of the thermodynamic parameters
of the process.27Figure 6d shows the van’t Hoff diagram (ln K vs 1/T) for the interaction between HSA
and complexes (1–3). The standard enthalpy change
(ΔH°) and the standard entropy change
(ΔS°) were obtained from the van’t
Hoff equation by plotting ln Kb versus
1/T, where −ΔH°/R is the angular coefficient and ΔS°/R is the linear coefficient.28 The negative variations in standard enthalpy (ΔH°) and standard entropy (ΔS°) suggest the occurrence of van der Waals forces and/or hydrogen
bonds. The negative values for ΔG indicate
a spontaneous binding process.

Conclusions
In
complexes [Ag(H2BzPh)NO3] (1), [Ag(H2BzpCH3Ph)NO3] (2), [Ag(H2BzpClPh)NO3] (3), and [Ag(H2BzpNO2Ph)NO3] (4), one
hydrazone (L) and one nitrate ligand are attached to the silver(I)
center. Experimental and theoretical (reported in Supporting Information) data suggested that although one of
the nitrate oxygens binds more strongly, the second oxygen from nitrate
and the hydrazone oxygen make much weaker interactions with the metal.
Similarly, experimental and theoretical data revealed that nitrate
dissociation probably occurs in solution and in biological milieu.
In addition, nitrate dissociation results in the strengthening of
all Ag–L bonds.

Although the cytotoxic effects of silver(I)
complexes against tumor
cells have not been fully investigated, the recent literature reports
that these compounds exhibit antiproliferative activity against several
tumor cell lineages. In some cases, the compounds have been shown
to be more cytotoxic to malignant than to nonmalignant cells.5

Complexes (1–3) proved
to have higher cytotoxic
activity against B16F10 (metastatic melanoma) cells than the free
hydrazone ligands and revealed to be more cytotoxic than cisplatin.
All compounds under study were more cytotoxic to B16F10 cells than
to the nonmalignant Melan-A cells. Interestingly, the SI of complex
(1), SI = 23, was much higher than that of the parent
hydrazone ligand, SI = 9.5, suggesting that in this case, coordination
to silver(I) was a good strategy for improving selectivity.

Complexes (1–3) interact with DNA probably
by an intercalative mode. This interaction might be favored by the
presence of the benzene or pyridine aromatic rings in the ligand skeleton.
In spite of the possible ability of complexes (1–3) to interact with DNA by an intercalative process, the silver(I)
center probably does not covalently bind to DNA. Hence, covalent binding
of silver(I) to DNA is probably not part of the mechanism of cytotoxic
action of these compounds.

The literature reports that silver(I),
when assayed as silver nitrate
aqueous solution, covalently binds to N7 of guanine and adenine.29 The foregoing results suggest that, when bound
to the hydrazones, silver(I) does not show high ability to bind to
the DNA bases. Hence, unlike cisplatin, the complexes under study
probably do not favor direct coordination of silver(I) to DNA.

In addition, the present investigation revealed that complexes
(1–3) interact with HSA (free-energy values on
the order of −20 kJ mol–1), indicating that
these compounds could be transported by albumin in the blood.

Considering that the pharmacological profile of silver(I) complexes
remains poorly investigated, the present study constitutes an important
contribution to the understanding of the possible applications of
silver(I)-based compounds as anticancer drug candidates.

Moreover,
the theoretical investigations (see Supporting Information) provided new insights into the nature
of silver(I) coordination chemistry.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Measurements
All common chemicals were
purchased from Aldrich and were used as received. Microanalyses were
performed on a PerkinElmer CHN 2400 analyzer. Melting points were
determined with a Mettler MQAPF-302 apparatus. Molar conductivities
(ΛM) were obtained using a YSI model 31 conductivity
bridge. Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrum
GX spectrometer employing KBr pellets (4000–400 cm–1). Electronic spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC UV–vis
spectrophotometer using 1 cm quartz cells. Fluorescence spectra were
recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter using a 1 cm
quartz cell. NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker DPX-400 ADVANCE
(400 MHz) spectrometer using DMSO-d6 as
the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. Single-crystal
X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on an Oxford-Diffraction
GEMINI-Ultra diffractometer (LabCri-UFMG) using graphite-Enhance Source
Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). Data were collected
at 100 (1), 120 (2), and 270 K (3). Data collection, cell refinements, and data reduction were performed
using the CrysAlisPro software.30 The CRYSALIS suite was used for analytical absorption corrections.30 The structures of (1) and (3) were solved using SUPERFLIP(31) and the structure of (2) was solved
using SIR92.32 Full-matrix
least-squares refinement procedure on F2 with anisotropic thermal parameters was carried on using SHELXL-2017/1.33 Positional and
anisotropic atomic displacement parameters were refined for all nonhydrogen
atoms. Hydrogen atoms were placed geometrically and the positional
parameters were refined using a riding model.34

Syntheses of the Hydrazones and Their Silver(I) Complexes
The hydrazones were prepared as previously described.35,36 The silver(I) complexes (1–4) were synthesized
by mixing a methanol solution (10 mL) of the desired hydrazone (1.0
mM) with an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (3 mL) added dropwise
in equimolar amount. The reaction mixture was maintained in the dark
at room temperature for 72 h. The obtained solids were filtered off,
washed with methanol and diethyl ether, and then dried under reduced
pressure.

Cytotoxic Activity
Cell
Cultures
B16F10 metastatic murine melanoma cells
were received as a gift from Ludwig Institute for Research about Cancer
(São Paulo, Brazil) and the nonmalignant murine melanocyte
cell line (Melan-A) was provided by Dr. Roger Chamas, Cancer Institute
(São Paulo, Brazil). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Cultilab) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). B16F10 cells were cultured
at pH 7.4 and Melan-A cell culture was prepared at pH 6.9 in the presence
of 200 nM Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). The cells were
maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2.

Evaluation of the Cytotoxic Activity
Cells were seeded
in 96-well plates (B16F10—1 × 103 cells/well
and Melan-A—6 × 103 cells/well). After complete
adhesion of the cells on surface plate, the medium was replaced with
fresh medium containing the test compounds in concentrations ranging
from 100 to 0.1 μM. After 72 h of incubation, 10 μL of
MTT (Sigma—5 mg/mL) was added in each well and the cells were
kept for 4 h at culture conditions. Cell viability was evaluated by
determining the rate of mitochondrial reduction of MTT to formazan.
The formazan precipitate was dissolved after replacing the culture
medium by DMSO (100 μL/well). Subsequently, the absorbance at
570 nm was measured on an ELISA reader (Thermo Plate Reader-TP).

Control tests were performed by incubating the cells with 1% (v/v)
of DMSO (negative control) in the maximum concentration employed in
the experiment, and it was observed that the cellular viability was
not affected by the solvent under these conditions. Cisplatin was
used as the positive control.

The results were expressed as
percentage of viable cells. The control
containing RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS was considered to result in 100%
cell viability. The IC50 values (μM) were calculated
by nonlinear regression using the GraphPad Prism version 6.0 for windows
(GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com). Statistical
analysis was carried out by means of the one-way analysis of variance
test, followed by Student–Newman–Keuls post-test. The
acceptable level of significance was 95% (p <
0.05).

Interactions of Complexes (1–3) with CT-DNA
Electronic
Absorption Spectral Studies
The interactions
of complexes (1–3) with CT-DNA were investigated
employing electronic spectroscopy. CT-DNA was dissolved in Tris-HCl
buffer (NaCl 50 mM/Tris-HCl 5 mM, pH 7.2) by shaking in an orbital
shaker at 120 rpm at 37 °C for 24 h. The concentration of CT-DNA
was calculated at 260 nm by using the molar extinction coefficient
(ε) of 6600 M–1 cm–1.38 The stock solutions of the compounds were prepared
in DMSO at 1.0 mM and subsequently diluted in Tris-HCl buffer. Titration
experiments were registered in the 240–400 nm range by keeping
the concentration of the complexes constant (30 μM), while progressively
increasing the concentration of CT-DNA (0–20 μM) at ambient
temperature. After each addition, the solutions were allowed to stand
in equilibrium for 5 min before recording the spectra.

Competitive
Binding between Complexes (1–3) and EB for CT-DNA
Competitive binding between EB and complexes
(1–3) for CT-DNA was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy
at ambient temperature. DNA–EB working solution (3.0 mL) (10
μM of CT-DNA with 10 μM of EB, prepared in Tris-HCl buffer)
was titrated by consecutive addition of the complexes (1.0 mM, stock
solution freshly prepared in DMSO). Concentrations of the complexes
ranged from 0 to 100 μM. After each addition, there was an incubation
period of 10 min. The fluorescence intensities at 602 nm (λexcitation at 545 nm) of EB bound to CT-DNA with increasing
concentrations of the complexes were measured.39

Studies of Interactions with Supercoiled
Plasmid DNA
Investigation on the interactions between the
complexes and supercoiled
plasmid DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis were carried out. Thus,
150 ng μL–1 of purified pUC19 plasmid DNA
from E. coli (Sigma) was incubated
with compounds (hydrazone ligands, complexes (1–3), AgNO3, and cisplatin) at 100 fμM in Tris-HCl
buffer (NaCl 50 mM/Tris-HCl 5 mM, pH 7.2)/dimethylformamide 5%. The
mixture was incubated by shaking in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm at
37 °C for 24 h. Thereafter, the reactions were quenched by adding
10 μL of the loading buffer solution [50 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 0.01%
bromophenol blue, 50% glycerol, and 250 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)]. The samples were analyzed by 0.9% agarose gel electrophoresis
in 0.5× Tris/borate/EDTA (TBE) buffer for 50 min at 82 mV. The
gel was stained after electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer with
2.5 μg mL–1 EB for 30 min and visualized by
UV light.40

Interactions of Complexes
(1–3) with HSA
The interactions of complexes
(1–3) with HSA
were investigated in Tris-HCl buffer solution (NaCl 50 mM/Tris-HCl
5 mM, pH 7.2). Stock solution of HSA (1.84 μM) was prepared
in Tris-HCl buffer, stored in the dark in the refrigerator, and used
within one week. The HSA concentration was calculated by measuring
the optical density at 280 nm and using the molar absorption coefficient
(ε) of 35353 M–1 cm–1 at
this wavelength.41

A solution of
HSA (3.0 mL) was titrated with a solution of the complex (stock solution
freshly prepared in DMSO). After each addition, the solution was stirred
and allowed to stand for 5 min at the experimental temperature (298,
303, and 310 K). The emission spectra were registered in the 300–550
nm range with excitation at 295 nm.42

The excitation and emission slit widths and scan rates were maintained
in all experiments. The amount of DMSO was maintained less than 3%
(by volume) and had no effect on any experimental result. The fluorescence
spectra (Figure 6a)
were recorded using solutions of the compounds at low concentration,
where the absorbances of HSA and of complexes (1–3) at 342 nm are <0.010. Hence, the inner filter effect could be
disregarded and fluorescence intensities were not corrected.43
