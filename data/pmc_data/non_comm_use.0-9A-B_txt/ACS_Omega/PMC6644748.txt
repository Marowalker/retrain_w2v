Crocus sativus L. (family: Iridaceae)
has been documented in traditional medicine with numerous medicinal
properties. Recently, we have shown that C. sativus extract (IIIM-141) displays promising efficacy in a genetic mice
(5XFAD) model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (ACS Chem.
Neurosci. 2017,16, 1756).
To translate the available traditional knowledge and the scientifically
validated results into modern medicine, herein we aimed to carry out
its preclinical development. IIIM-141 is primarily a mixture of crocins
containing trans-4-GG-crocin (36 % w/w) as the principal
component. The in vitro studies show that IIIM-141 has protective
as well as therapeutic properties in assays related to AD. It induces
the expression of P-gp, thereby enhancing the amyloid-β clearance
from an AD brain. It also inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome and protects
SH-SY5Y cells against amyloid-β- and glutamate-induced neurotoxicities.
In behavioral models, it decreased the streptozotocin-induced memory
impairment in rats and recovered the scopolamine-induced memory deficit
in Swiss albino mice at 100 mg/kg dose. The acute oral toxicity study
shows that IIIM-141 is safe up to the dose of 2000 mg/kg, with no
effect on the body weight and on the biochemical/hematological parameters
of the rats. The repeated oral administration of IIIM-141 for 28 days
at 100 mg/kg dose did not cause any preterminal deaths and abnormalities
in Wistar rats. The pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that after
oral administration of IIIM-141, the majority of crocin gets hydrolyzed
to its aglycone crocetin. The sustained release (SR) capsule formulation
was developed, which showed an improved in vitro dissolution profile
and a significantly enhanced plasma exposure in the pharmacokinetic
study. The SR formulation resulted in 3.3-fold enhancement in the
area under the curve of crocetin and doubling of the crocetin/crocin
ratio in plasma compared with the extract. The data presented herein
will serve as the benchmark for further research on this botanical
candidate.

==== Body
Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative
disorder of complex etiology with progressive neuronal damage resulting
in dementia symptoms. The therapeutic interventions for the treatment
of AD are mainly focused on three hallmarks, namely impaired neurotransmission,
amyloid-β deposition, and tau hyperphosphorylation [formation
of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)].1 Apart
from these primary hallmarks, in recent years, newer approaches are
being explored such as targeting amyloid-β clearance via induction
of P-gp,2 inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome,3 or targeting glucose metabolism-related targets.4 Despite the extensive efforts on each of these
hallmarks, till now only four medicines (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine,
and memantine) are available in the market for treating this disease.
All these drugs provide only symptomatic treatment, whereas none of
them halts progression of the disease. Thus, identifying a disease-modifying
therapy for AD is one of the major challenges for researchers. The
undesirable outcomes of all recent clinical trials have indicated
that no single strategy would efficiently work for treating AD. Therefore,
a polypharmacology/multiple target approach has better chances of
success in AD clinical trials. Increased consideration of the contributing
role of neuroinflammation has necessitated the need for inhibiting
the inflammasome along with enhancing amyloid-β clearance and
providing protection to neurons.5 The polypharmacology
involves either administering a combination of multiple drugs acting
on different targets or identifying a candidate that displays a favorable
effect on multiple targets of the disease. The latter strategy would
have better chances of getting successful; however, it is highly challenging
to identify such a candidate.

Botanical drugs or natural products
have such a unique ability
to display polypharmacological effects. Crocus sativus L. (also called as saffron or kesar; family: Iridaceae) is a traditional
medicine being consumed by human beings since ancient times because
of several health benefits.6 Saffron extracts
have antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory,7 antitumor,8 free radical scavenging,9 anticonvulsant,10 anti-ischemic,11 and anti-Alzheimer activities.12 The saffron stigma contains a group of carotenoids including
picrocrocin and crocins. Sixteen crocins have been reported in the
literature, differing via the type of sugar moiety and the geometry
of the 13–14 double bond (structures are provided in section
S1 of the Supporting Information).8,13 The group of crocins and their aglycone metabolite, crocetin, are
mainly responsible for pharmacological activities associated with
saffron.

Recently, we have shown that the administration of
the saffron
extract along with the food has resulted in a decreased load of amyloid-β,
upregulation of synaptic proteins, and reduced neuroinflammation in
the brains of 5XFAD mice.14 The history
of its traditional usage, the documented health benefits, and the
scientific data generated over a period of two to three decades indicate
a strong potential for its translation to a modern drug. Thus, the
present study is aimed to carry out its “preclinical development”
as a botanical drug candidate. The hydroalcoholic extract of C. sativus stigma (IIIM-141) was studied for its
chemical standardization (with five chemical markers), quality control
(for aflatoxin/pesticide content and microbial load), in vitro efficacy
in multiple targets, in vivo efficacy in anti-dementia models, acute/subacute
toxicity in rodents, and preparation of the oral dosage form. The
scalable sustained release (SR) formulation was prepared to achieve
the SR of crocin (and its bioactive metabolite crocetin) over a longer
period of time.15 All preclinical results
of IIIM-141 are discussed in this paper.

Results
AD is
a complex and incurable disease characterized by the presence
of amyloid-β plaques, NFTs, and degeneration of neurons. The
formation of amyloid-β plaques is the central event in the AD
pathology. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to target amyloid-β
associated approaches, including reducing amyloid-β production,
preventing amyloid-β aggregation, and facilitating amyloid-β
clearance.1c,1d,5 However,
recently, it has been reported that amyloid-β centric approaches
(primarily those to reduce amyloid-β burden) that reached phase
III clinical trials have failed (semagacestat, tarenflurbil, and tramiprosate
have been discontinued). These failures have raised a concern about
targeting the production of amyloid-β plaques. The plethora
of evidences suggests that a single approach is not successful for
the treatment of AD. Additionally, the complex pathology of AD also
suggests that it needs to be tackled via a multifaceted approach.
IIIM-141 is a botanical extract based on C. sativus, which displays multiple pharmacological activities related to AD
pathology. Crocin is the bioactive marker and the major component
of the extract; therefore crocin enrichment (crocin-enriched fraction:
IIIM-141-CEF) was also performed and was studied in the P-gp induction
assay and formulation studies.

The present study was undertaken
to develop IIIM-141 as a botanical
product. Toward this objective, a systematic study was planned, which
comprises the following subobjectives viz. (a) preparation, standardization,
and quality control of the crocin-rich extract; (b) demonstrating
in vitro/in vivo efficacy of the extract in various models; (c) development
of suitable oral formulation of the extract; (d) pharmacokinetic analysis
of the extract and formulation; and (e) acute and subacute oral toxicity
study in rats. The data and results of these preclinical studies are
provided in the following sections.

Standardization, Characterization,
Analytical Method Development,
and Quality Control of IIIM-141
The hydroalcoholic extract
(IIIM-141) was prepared using the cold-maceration method. The IIIM-141
was then partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The evaporation
of the water layer to dryness yielded crocin-enriched fraction, IIIM-141-CEF.
The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) chromatograms of
IIIM-141 and IIIM-141-CEF (at 50 μg/mL) are shown in Figure 1. Although a total
of 16 crocins are reported in the literature, only 6–7 peaks
could be seen in the HPLC chromatogram, with the peak appearing at tR 3.9 min (crocin-1) being the major one. Doubling
of the height of peaks in IIIM-141-CEF is indicative of the ∼40–50%
enrichment of crocin-1 content in IIIM-141-CEF. To chemically standardize
the extract and fraction, five chemical markers were isolated from
IIIM-141 using semipreparative HPLC. The isolated markers M1–M5
were characterized as trans-4-GG-crocin (crocin-1)
(M1, tR = 3.9 min), trans-3-Gg-crocin (M2, tR = 4.9 min), trans-2-gg-crocin (M3, tR =
8.5 min), cis-4-GG-crocin (M4, tR = 9.2 min) and trans-crocetin (M5, tR = 12.9 min). The liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) chromatograms of IIIM-141 and the mass
spectrums of M1–M5 are provided in section S2 of the Supporting Information. The aglycone crocetin
(M5) was synthesized via alkaline hydrolysis of the hydroalcoholic
extract IIIM-141 and was obtained mainly in a trans-form (the ratio
of trans to cis is 98:2).

Figure 1 HPLC chromatograms of the hydroalcoholic extract
of C. sativus stigma (IIIM-141) (A)
and crocin-1-enriched
fraction (IIIM-141-CEF) (B). Labels of each peak indicate the retention
time and the area under the curve. Both HPLC chromatograms are recorded
at 50 μg/mL concentration. The major marker compound crocin-1
(M1) appears at tR = 3.8–4.0 min.

The chemical standardization of
the botanical extracts with marker
compounds assures reproducibility of the batches, quality, efficacy,
safety, and acceptability of the botanical formulations. Therefore,
these extracts were standardized using isolated four markers by the
HPLC method. The % content of M1−M5 in IIIM-141 was found to
be 36.1, 13.7, 6.0, 7.6, and 0.07 % w/w of the dry raw material. Furthermore,
it was found that the enrichment step resulted in 1.75-times increase
in the content of M1 (64 % w/w of M1 in IIIM-141-CEF) (Table 1). IIIM-141 was also studied
for different quality control parameters, as depicted in Table 2. The content of aflatoxins
(B1, B2, G1, and G2) and pesticides was below the detection limits.
The total microbial count, the total yeast/mold count, and the count
for specific microbes such as Enterobacteriacea, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
in the acceptable limits.

In Vitro Efficacy
Initially, the
toxicity window of
the test item was determined in each cell line that was used. Results
indicated that IIIM-141 does not show any toxicity up to 200 μg/mL
in LS-180, SH-SY5Y, and THP-1 cells. The effect of IIIM-141 on the
NLRP3 inflammasome was studied in THP-1 cells. It showed strong inhibition
of the NLRP3 inflammasome at a concentration of 25 μg/mL, as
depicted in Figure 2a. IIIM-141 at 100 μg/mL showed 42% inhibition of interleukin
(IL)-1β release in comparison to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) +
nigericin (100%). MCC-950 (CAS no. 210826-40-7) was used as a positive
control, which showed 90% inhibition of IL-1β release at 40
ng/mL, in comparison to LPS + nigericin (100%).

Rh123 levels at various concentrations of crocetin and crocin in LS-180
cells; (e) protection of SH-SY5Y cells from amyloid-β toxicity;
and (f) protection of SH-SY5Y cells from glutamate toxicity. The data
presented in all figures (Figure 2a–f) are the mean of three independent experiments.
The data presented here for neuroprotection (Figure 2e,f) are an average of three independent
experiments, and for each experiment, six wells (containing 10 000
cells each) were used for every treatment.

In the P-gp induction assay, IIIM-141 treatment in LS-180
colon
cancer cells at various concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 100 μg/mL
led to a significant increase in the efflux of substrate rhodamine
123 dye, as determined by the decrease (by 16–40%) in intracellular
% Rh123 levels (Figure 2b). Rifampicin was used as a positive control in this study. Rifampicin
at 10 μg/mL showed a decrease in the intracellular accumulation
of Rh123 levels (by 31%) in LS180 cells, in comparison with the control
(100%). The Western blot results indicated that IIIM-141 induces P-gp
expression by 3–8 folds in LS-180 colon cancer cells at concentrations
ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL (Figure 2c), which might be the possible explanation
for the increased efflux of the Rh123 dye. Rifampicin at 10 μg/mL
showed a 9-fold increase in the P-gp expression. The pure markers
crocin and crocetin were also tested for P-gp induction activity in
LS-180 cells. Similar to the IIIM-141 extract, both crocin and crocetin
showed potent P-gp induction activity, as shown by reduced % intracellular
Rh123 levels in LS-180 cells (Figure 2d). As crocin displayed a dose-dependent decrease in
the intracellular accumulation of the Rh123 dye (Figure 2d), it was hypothesized that
enriching the extract with crocin content would enhance its bioactivity.
The crocin-1-enriched fraction IIIM-141-CEF (wherein, the crocin-1
content is enhanced by 1.75-fold) and the hydroalcoholic extract IIIM-141
showed 73 and 60% Rh123 levels in LS180 cells at 25 μg/mL, indicating
the superiority of the enriched fraction.

The neuroprotective
activity of IIIM-141 was assessed in human
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, wherein it completely protected the neuronal
cells from amyloid-β- (Figure 2e) and glutamate-induced toxicities (Figure 2f). Ginkgolide B, a known neuroprotective
agent,16 was used as a reference standard
in the neuroprotection assay.

In Vivo Efficacy
The in vivo efficacy of IIIM-141 was
assessed in two behavioral models: (a) Morris water maze (MWM) test17 and (b) passive avoidance test.18 The MWM test assesses the ability of animals to locate
the hidden platform in the pool while swimming. Prior to the study,
animals were trained for this activity. As a part of the study design,
the memory of the animals was impaired using streptozotocin (STZ).
There was a significant increase in the latency time to locate the
hidden platform in STZ-treated rats as compared with artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (aCSF) (vehicle)-treated rats, suggesting memory impairment.
The recovery of animals from this memory deficit by the test sample
was assessed using the swimming test. The treatment of memory-impaired
rats with IIIM-141 at 50 and 100 mg/kg dose on the 15–18th
day of the study resulted in the reversal of the STZ-induced memory
deficit, as demonstrated by the reduction in the latency time. The
tracking of rats during the study and the effect of IIIM-141 on the
latency time is depicted in Figure 3a,b, respectively. The % change in the transfer latency
with respect to group G1 on day 4 is shown in Figure 3c. Briefly, IIIM-141 showed anti-dementia
properties at a dose of 100 mg/kg dose.

STZ-induced dementia in SD rats using MWM
test and on scopolamine-induced dementia in SAM model using passive
avoidance test. (a) Representative tracking of rats in MWM; (b) effect

latency with respect to control, G1, on the retention trial in the
passive avoidance test; and (e) effect of IIIM-141 on transfer latency
time in the passive avoidance test. The statistical comparison was
made between G1 and G2 (#p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01) and between treatment groups G3–G4/G5 and disease
control G2 (*p < 0.05, **p <
0.01).

The effect of IIIM-141 was then
assessed in another behavioral
model (passive avoidance test), wherein the learning ability of animals
to avoid an anxious event (electric shock) was studied. The study
equipment consisted of two compartments, one light and other dark,
containing a grid floor that is electrically connected by a sliding
door. The reduction in transfer latency from the light compartment
to the dark compartment indicated memory impairment. The administration
of anticholinergic drug scopolamine results in memory impairment in
mice, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in transfer latency
in comparison to the control (Figure 3d). Administration of IIIM-141 at 100 mg/kg body weight
for 7 days significantly recovered the memory, as shown by the increase
in transfer latency, compared with scopolamine-treated mice (Figure 3e). Positive control
rivastigmine at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight resulted in a significant
increase in the latency time (Figure 3d,e), indicating that memory has been restored in these
animals. In summary, pretreatment of animals with IIIM-141 for 7 days
at 100 mg/kg showed anti-dementia properties, as demonstrated by a
significant improvement in scopolamine-induced memory deficit in passive
avoidance test in Swiss albino mice (SAM).

Safety Studies
As per regulatory requirements, for
a botanical drug candidate, acute oral toxicity and 28-day repeat
dose toxicity of IIIM-141 was assessed by following the guidelines
of Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD).
In the acute toxicity study, the extract did not cause any type of
toxicity, and all animals survived the study over a period of 14 days
at a single dose of 2000 mg/kg. Furthermore, there was no change in
the body weight of animals (Figure 4a) and no effect on biochemical and hematological parameters
(Figure 4b) even at
this dose, except for a slight gastric distress and soft stools during
the first hour of administration. The LD50 of IIIM-141
in Wistar rats was found to be more than 2000 mg/kg of the body weight.

of a single dose (2000 mg/kg) of IIIM-141 in female Wistar rats on

days on the body weight of male and female rats, respectively; (e,f)
effect of daily administration of IIIM-141 (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg)

(25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) for 28 days on the histological parameters
of male and female rats, respectively.

The 28-day repeat dose toxicity was performed at 25, 50,
and 100
mg/kg doses. There was no specific treatment-associated preterminal
deaths and abnormalities observed in the rats at any of these doses.
All animals from the control and the treated dose groups survived
throughout the dosing period of 28 days. Food consumption of the control
and treated animals was found comparable throughout the dosing period.
There was no effect on the body weight (Figure 4c,d), biochemical parameters (Figure 4e,f), and hematological parameters
(Figure 4g,h) on day
29 in the IIIM-141-treated group in comparison to the control group.
The results of safety studies are shown in Figure 4a–h.

Chemical and Enzymatic
Hydrolytic Stability of Crocin
Crocin is the bioactive marker
of this botanical extract, and hence
its chemical and enzymatic stabilities were studied to identify a
suitable formulation for the extract. The pharmacokinetic profile
clearly indicated that developing SR formulations would be an ideal
strategy for effectively delivering bioactive markers crocin and crocetin.
The pH-dependent chemical stability of crocin (pH 1.2 to pH 10 buffer
solutions) indicated that it is stable up to pH 8.0. However, it was
isomerized to the cis form and hydrolyzed to its aglycone crocetin
beyond pH 8.0. The hydrolysis of crocin to crocetin was also observed
in rat plasma. The results of stability studies are summarized in Table 3.

Formulation Development,
Evaluation, and Characterization
The pharmacokinetic analysis
of crocin indicated that it reaches
the blood circulation in its hydrolyzed form crocetin. The plasma
half-life of crocetin is low, and it gets eliminated quickly from
the blood.19 The rationale for developing
SR formulations of standardized extracts of C. sativus was to release crocin in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in a controlled
manner. With this approach, crocin would be available over a longer
period of time to the hydrolytic enzymes of GIT for bioactivation
to its aglycone crocetin. The aglycone metabolite, being lipophilic
in nature, would rapidly get absorbed from the GIT, resulting in its
higher concentration in blood circulation.

The SR formulations
were prepared by the wet granulation method. On the basis of the assay
results, a formulation, equivalent to 50 mg of crocin-1, was filled
into an empty hard gelatin capsule, and in vitro dissolution was performed
in triplicates. The formulation details and % crocin-1 content are
in Table 4.

The results obtained from the in
vitro dissolution study of formulations
indicated the SR of crocin-1 (60–75% release) over a period
of 24 h compared to the plain hydroalcoholic extract and the enriched
fraction of C. sativus (100% release
in 30 min). The dissolution profiles and results of formulations are
shown in Figure 5 and Table 5. The dissolution
results of hydroalcoholic (IIIM-141) and enriched fraction (IIIM-141-CEF)
of C. sativus with their SR formulations,
namely, CSHA-14 and CSE-2, respectively, were compared (Table 5). Briefly, the SR profile of
CSHA-14 showed 2.8-fold improvement in the area under the curve (AUC)(0–24) with respect to IIIM-141 extract (172 vs 482
μg/mL h). Furthermore, Tmax of CSHA-14
was 16 h compared to CSHA-1 (0.5 h), indicating the SR profile of
SR formulation over the plain extract. A similar observation was noted
in the SR formulation (CSE-2) of crocin-1-enriched fraction (IIIM-141-CEF;
CSE-1). The AUC(0–24) of CSE-2 was 3.6-fold higher
than that of CSE-1 (517 vs 143 μg/mL h). On the basis of these
results, CSHA-14 and CSE-2 were considered as the optimum formulations.
The in vitro dissolution results were then validated using the comparative
oral pharmacokinetics of IIIM-141-CEF and its SR formulation CSE-2
in rats.

The compatibility of the extract with the polymers
(HPMC-K4M and
HPMC-K15M) used in the formulations was investigated using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
analysis (Figure 6a,b,
respectively). The formulation ingredients, their 1:1 binary mixture,
and SR formulations were investigated to identify any incompatibility
with each other. The DSC and FT-IR examinations indicated no interaction
between the extract and excipients and thus pointed out no incompatibility
between them.

and CSE-2.

Pharmacokinetic Study
Before comparing the pharmacokinetics
of the extract and its formulation, the oral bioavailability of pure
markers, namely crocin and crocetin, was determined. The absolute
oral bioavailability of crocin was found to be <1% because majority
of the crocin gets hydrolyzed to crocetin when given perorally. There
was minimum conversion of crocin to crocetin (parent to metabolite)
upon intravenous (IV) administration of crocin at a dose of 5 mg/kg.
However, crocin to crocetin conversion was 2-fold higher following
oral administration of crocin at 50 mg/kg in male Sprague Dawley (SD)
rats compared to its IV administration. The time versus plasma drug
concentration curves of crocin after IV and oral administrations are
shown in Figure 7a,b. Figure 7b clearly indicates
that majority of crocin is converted to crocetin. The absolute oral
bioavailability of crocetin upon IV and oral administrations in male
SD rats (5 vs 50 mg/kg, respectively) was found to be 48%. The elimination
half-life (t1/2) and the terminal plasma
half-life were 1.60 and 2.08 h, respectively, as shown in Figure 7c.

and SR formulation (CSE-2) in SD rats (dose equivalent to 45 mg/kg

after administration of crocin-1-enriched fraction (IIIM-141-CEF)
and its SR formulation (CSE-2) at a dose equivalent to 45 mg/kg of
crocin-1 in SD rats.

The comparative oral pharmacokinetic analysis of the crocin-1-enriched
fraction of C. sativus (IIIM-141-CEF)
and its SR formulation was also performed in SD rats. The extract/formulation
equivalent to 45 mg/kg of crocin-1 was filled in 9el capsules and
delivered to rats by the oral route. The two analytes (crocin-1 and
its hydrolysis product crocetin) were measured in the plasma. The
pharmacokinetic profile and the parameters of crocin-1 and crocetin
after administration of IIIM-141-CEF and its SR formulation (CSE-2)
are shown in Figure 7d,e.

The comparative pharmacokinetic results indicate that
when IIIM-141-CEF
was administered in rats, the majority of crocin-1 was metabolized
to crocetin. The AUC(0–∞) of crocin-1 and
crocetin in IIIM-141-CEF was observed to be 1360 and 5540 μg
h/mL, respectively (crocetin/crocin-1 ratio in plasma was 4:1). When
the equivalent dose of extract (IIIM-141-CEF) was administered as
a SR formulation (CSE-2 formulation), the crocetin concentration in
plasma increased by 3.3-fold. The AUC(0–∞) of crocetin changed from 5540 to 18300 μg h/mL, and Cmax also increased by 1.79-fold. Interestingly,
the crocetin/crocin-1 ratio in plasma also increased from 4:1 to 9:1.
This indicated that more amount of crocetin (a bioactive constituent)
is available in blood circulation to exert the therapeutic effect
at the site of action. Furthermore, the AUC(0–t) ratio obtained from in vitro dissolution and pharmacokinetics
was in agreement with each other (3.62 vs 3.30).

Discussion
Because of the complex disease pathology, the polypharmacology
approach is desirable for the management of AD. In particular, natural
products have always proved to be a valuable source of drugs for central
nervous system (CNS) diseases. Furthermore, the CNS drugs have deep
roots in traditional medicines, specifically in China, India, and
South Africa. Hence, the crude drugs, which are being used in traditional
systems of medicine, are worth validating scientifically to translate
them into modern drugs. In this context, C. sativus is being used in Ayurveda and other folk medicines for treating
various ailments. The strong history of its traditional usage and
the available scientifically validated data for AD12c,12d,12f,14,20 have prompted us to develop it as a botanical
drug. The active principles of this plant are carotenoid class of
compounds, most of which are highly polar in nature and thus are water-soluble
and get extracted in hydroalcoholic solution. Therefore, herein, a
hydroalcoholic extract (IIIM-141) was studied. IIIM-141 is primarily
a mixture of crocins, wherein crocin-1 (trans-GG-crocin)
is the major component. It is present in 36.1 % w/w of the dry plant
material. The repeatability has been the major concern associated
with botanical drugs; therefore IIIM-141 was standardized using four
chemical markers viz. trans-4-GG-crocin, trans-3-Gg-crocin, trans-2-gg-crocin, and cis-4-GG-crocin to have robust control over the quality
of the extract.

The hydroalcoholic extract possesses antioxidant
property,12d,21 inhibits amyloid-β fibrillogenesis,12d and enhances amyloid-β clearance pathways,
including clearance
across BBB, enzymatic degradation, and ApoE clearance pathways.14 In addition, herein, we have shown that IIIM-141
also inhibits the production of IL-1β release in THP-1 cells,
suggesting its inhibitory effect on the NLRP3 inflammasome. The inflammasomes
regulate the release of IL-1β and have been found to play an
important role in pathogenic neuroinflammation in animal models of
AD.3a,22 Further, we have shown that IIIM-141 along
with its constituents, crocin and crocetin, also induces the expression
of P-gp, an efflux transporter pump responsible for the transport
of amyloid-β from the brain to the blood. The extract IIIM-141
protected human neuroblastoma cells from the toxicity of amyloid-β
and glutamate at 10–50 μg/mL, indicating the potential
of this botanical lead to be developed as a “dietary food supplement”
or a “nutraceutical product.”

Cognitive decline
is a prime symptom of AD, and a large number
of animal models have been established over the years that reiterates
the aspects of the cognitive impairments seen in AD. Behavioral models
particularly, MWM test17 and passive avoidance
test,18 are the most commonly used models,
which provide critical linkage with the pathology of AD. The MWM test
uses rodents to study behavioral neurological parameters such as spatial
learning and memory, and it strongly correlates with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function and hippocampal
synaptic plasticity.23 The
intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection of STZ resulted in the progressive
deficits in memory, learning, and cognitive ability in rats, which
is similar to sporadic AD.24 In this test,
the decrease in the latency time to locate the hidden platform indicates
successful learning. The treatment of memory-impaired rats with IIIM-141
extract resulted in a decrease in STZ-induced memory impairment in
rats at a dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. The passive avoidance test is a fear-aggravated
test used to evaluate learning and memory in rodent models. Scopolamine,
an anticholinergic drug, induces significant memory impairment and
is associated with an increased latency time. IIIM-141 at 100 mg/kg
dose was able to recover the animals from scopolamine-induced memory
deficit. The results of these two studies further supports our earlier
results obtained in the transgenic mice model14 and warrants the development of this botanical lead for the treatment
of AD or other dementia-associated diseases. Furthermore, IIIM-141
displayed an excellent safety profile in acute oral toxicity as well
as in 28-day repeat dose toxicity study. These results provide scientific
validation for the therapeutic benefits and safe usage of this spice
as a food ingredient, used particularly in Asian countries since ancient
times.

The crocins are highly hydrophilic in nature because
of the presence
of multiple sugars at both the terminals of the aglycone crocetin.
The therapeutic activity of the Crocus extract is
attributed to the trans-crocetin. The enzymatic bioactivation
of crocin primarily occurs in the intestinal tract resulting in the
formation of “crocetin” via hydrolytic cleavage of the
glycosidic linkages.19a,20b,25 The aglycone crocetin has been reported to inhibit the process of
amyloid-β aggregation and increase the clearance of amyloid-β42.
It inhibits the formation of amyloid-β fibrils, destabilizes
preformed amyloid-β fibrils, and stabilizes amyloid-β
oligomers, thereby preventing their conversion into amyloid-β
fibrils.26 Cathepsin B, a lysosomal cysteine
protease of the papain family, has been reported to play an important
role in the enhancement of amyloid-β42 clearance.27 Orlacchio and co-workers28 have shown that the trans-crocetin improves
amyloid-β42 degradation in monocytes of AD patients via enhancing
the cathepsin B levels. Crocetin also provides neuroprotection by
reducing the production of various neurotoxic molecules from activated
microglia.29 The pharmacokinetic studies20b,25 and the reports on pharmacological activities of “crocetin”26,28,29 have indicated that this aglycone
is the bioactive metabolite responsible for all documented therapeutic
benefits of saffron.

AD being the chronic disease, the treatment
regime requires treatment
for multiple days. Therefore, the availability of crocetin in the
blood circulation for longer duration would help in enhancing the
treatment outcome. The formation of crocetin occurs via enzymatic
hydrolysis of crocin in the GIT. Crocin being highly hydrophilic in
nature, it was thought that controlling its release in the GIT would
result in the prolonged availability of crocetin in the blood circulation.
This would also avoid the elimination of crocin from the GIT itself,
before absorption. Therefore, the SR formulations were prepared with
the hypothesis that the controlled release of the crocin from the
formulation would create a more favorable scenario for its bioactivation
to its metabolite crocetin and is expected to produce a higher ratio
of crocetin/crocin in the blood circulation. The comparative pharmacokinetic
study conducted in rats have shown that the SR formulations have resulted
in superior plasma exposure and higher ratio of the crocetin/crocin
in the plasma (4:1 vs 9:1). The 3-fold improvement in plasma exposure
by SR capsule formulation would result in 3-fold reduction in the
effective dose of the extract in preclinical/clinical studies. The
validation of SR formulations in the oral pharmacokinetics study has
indicated that these formulations would be an advantage in terms of
dose reduction, better therapeutic window, cost of therapy, and improvement
in patience compliance.

Conclusions
In the present paper,
the chemical standardization and quality
control of anti-dementia/anti-Alzheimer botanical candidate IIIM-141
have been presented. The developed extract was found to be efficacious
in in vitro and in vivo assays of dementia and AD and was found to
be safe as per OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals. The newly
developed SR capsule formulation showed superiority over the conventional
formulation, as seen in the in vitro dissolution and in the oral pharmacokinetic
study. Overall, the preclinical data presented herein warrant its
clinical investigation. This data will serve as the benchmark for
further research on this botanical product.

Experimental Section
General
The authentic plant material of C. sativus (stigma) was purchased from Srinagar (Jammu
and Kashmir, India). It was taxonomically characterized, and a voucher
specimen was deposited in the Janaki Ammal Herbarium of the Indian
Institute of Integrative Medicine. Crocin (CAS no. 42553-65-1) was
procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The raw material was
stored at 2–8 °C until further use.

The anti-dementia
studies were performed at Panacea Biotech Ltd., Mohali on commercial
basis. The protocols of MWM test and passive avoidance test were approved
by the Panacea Biotech Animal Ethical Ccommittee (IAEC approval numbers:
411 and 407). The pharmacokinetic study was performed at Eurofins
Advinus Ltd. Bangalore (IAEC approval number. ATL-43_PKM-035/Jun-2017).

Chemicals and Reference Compounds
Reference marker
compounds, trans-4-GG-crocin (also named as crocin-1), trans-3-Gg-crocin, trans-2-gg-crocin, and cis-4-GG-crocin, were isolated from the IIIM-141 extract
using semipreparative HPLC. These markers were used for standardization
of extracts by HPLC. Acetonitrile (SD Fine Chemicals), methanol (SD
Fine Chemicals), formic acid (Rankem), and ethanol were used in the
semipreparative isolation of markers by HPLC. Polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP)-K30 and ethyl cellulose 10 cps were procured from Sigma-Aldrich.
HPMC-K4M and HPMC-K15M were obtained as gift samples from Colorcon
Asia Pvt. Ltd. (Goa). Eudragit RS100 was received from Evonik Industries
as a gift sample. Empty hard gelatin capsules were obtained from Natural
Capsules Ltd. Bengaluru, India as a gift sample.

Synthesis of trans-Crocetin
The hydroalcoholic
extract (IIIM-141; 3 g) of C. sativus was stirred in the alkali solution (10 % w/v NaOH; 70 mL) at 80
°C for 5 h. The resulting mixture was then allowed to cool down
to room temperature and neutralized using 1N HCl solution under ice-cold
conditions. The resulting precipitate was filtered using a Whatman
filter paper, and the residue was washed with water (3 × 150
mL). The obtained powder (340 mg) was a mixture of trans- and cis-crocetin in the ratio of 85:15 (ratio
determined by HPLC; see section S3 of the Supporting Information). The silica gel column chromatography of this
mixture of trans- and cis-crocetin
using hexane–EtOAc as the mobile phase resulted in the isolation
of trans-crocetin (ratio of trans-to cis-form as 98:2).

Preparation, Chemical Standardization,
and Quality Control of C. sativus Extract
The hydroalcoholic extract
of C. sativus stigma was prepared in
three stages using the cold-maceration method. The first stage of
extraction consisted of mixing ∼100 g of raw material with
1000 mL of hydroalcoholic solution (EtOH/water—1:1). After
3 h of extraction, the resulting mixture was filtered to get the first
intermediate hydroalcoholic extract and the residue. The residue obtained
from the first and second stages was further extracted in the same
way as stage 1. The hydroalcoholic extract obtained from all three
stages were combined, and ethanol was evaporated using vacuo rotavapor
at 40 °C. The concentrated mass was lyophilized to generate a
dry powder of the hydroalcoholic extract (IIIM-141). The extractive
value was found to be 50–55 % w/w of the dry raw material.
To prepare crocin-1-enriched fraction (IIIM-141-CEF), the hydroalcoholic
extract was partitioned between water and ethyl acetate. The aqueous
portion was concentrated on a rotary evaporator to get a powder of
crocin-1-enriched fraction (IIIM-141-CEF). The extractive value of
IIIM-141-CEF was found to be 25–30 % w/w of the dry raw material.
The obtained extracts were pulverized, sieved through sieve #30, and
stored in a vacuum desiccator until further use. The extracts were
standardized by HPLC using five markers viz. trans-4-GG-crocin (crocin-1), trans-3-Gg-crocin, trans-2-gg-crocin, cis-4-GG-crocin and trans-crocetin.

The simultaneous estimation of markers
in IIIM-141 and IIIM-141-CEF was performed using a HPLC system consisting
of an Intersil C8-3 (5 μ, 250 × 4.6 mm) column and a photodiode
array detector. The detection wavelength was 440 nm. The flow rate
was 1 mL/min with the injection volume of 10 μL. The total run
time was 25 min with gradient elution using the mobile phase of acetonitrile
(A) and 0.1 % v/v formic acid in water (B). The gradient (with respect
to v/v % of B) was as follows: 0–2 min, 70; 2–7 min,
70 → 30; 7–15 min, 30; 15–20 min, 30 →
70, and 20–25 min, 70. Calibration curve for each marker in
the concentration range of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μg/mL
was prepared. For simultaneous estimation of markers in IIIM-141 and
IIIM-141-CEF, ∼5 mg of extract was transferred in an Eppendorf
tube containing 1 mL of MeOH, and the mixture was sonicated. The Eppendorf
tubes were centrifuged at 16 000 RCF (G-force) for 10 min to
separate the solid matrix, if any. The supernatant was injected into
the HPLC system after diluting it with MeOH to get a concentration
of 50 μg/mL. The % content of each marker was calculated using
a regression equation obtained from the calibration curve of each
reference standard of a marker. The data are shown in Table 1.

The extract was also
evaluated for acid-insoluble ash, loss on
drying at 105 °C, total ash, total sugar, crude fat, protein,
moisture content, 50% alcohol-soluble extractive, aflatoxin/pesticide
content,30 and microbial load using the
procedures described previously.31 Aflatoxins
content (B1, B2, G1, and G2) was determined using an Official Methods
of Analysis of AOAC International.30−32 Microbial testing31 of the extract was performed as per British
Pharmacopoeia33 to find out the total bacterial
count, total yeast and mold count, and the count of Enterobacteriaceae and other Gram-negative bacteria
(E. coli, Salmonella spp., S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa).

In Vitro Efficacy
The mechanism of action of IIIM-141
was unraveled by performing various in vitro assays viz. NLRP inflammasome
inhibition,3a P-gp induction,34 and neuroprotection34a against amyloid-β- and glutamate-induced toxicities. Before
performing in vitro mechanistic studies, the toxicity window of the
test item was determined in each cell line using the MTT assay.35

Inhibition of NLRP3 Inflammasome
Human monocytes, THP-1
cells were differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20
ng/mL) for 24 h. The media was changed after 24 h, and the cells were
kept in rest of two days in complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were
primed with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 4 h, followed by pretreatment
with different concentrations of IIIM-141 for 30 min. Then, the cells
were stimulated with 10 μM nigericin for 1 h. The supernatant
was collected and stored at −20 °C for enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay of IL-1β. The secretion of IL-1β with nigericin
was measured by BD OptEIA for IL-1β (human) and was considered
as readout for NLRP3 activation.3a

P-gp
Induction Activity of IIIM-141 in LS-180 Cells
IIIM-141 was
screened for its ability to induce P-gp using rhodamine
123 (Rh123) cell exclusion method in colorectal LS-180 cells (ECACC
catalog number 87021202; passage number 52), as described earlier.34 In this method, P-gp function was evaluated
for accumulation and efflux of rhodamine 123 (Rh123). Rifampicin was
used as the positive control for the experiment. The Western blot
analysis of IIIM-141 in LS-180 cells was also carried out as described
earlier.34

Neuroprotection of SH-SY5Y
Cells Against Amyloid-β- and
Glutamate-Induced Toxicities
The neuroprotection activity
of IIIM-141 was evaluated in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, using the
protocol described earlier.34a,34d Briefly, 10 000
SH-SY5Y cells (passage no. 13) were cultured in MEM/F12 media into
each well of a 96-well plate. Cells were further differentiated with
10 μM retinoic acid for 1 week. Six wells were used for each
treatment, and the test samples were added 30 min prior to the treatment
with amyloid-β or glutamate for 24 h. Ginkgolide B was used
as a standard neuroprotective agent16 in
this assay. MTT (1.2 mM) was added 4 h prior to the termination of
the experiment.35 The cell viability of
the vehicle-treated cells was considered as 100%, whereas the viability
of the cells treated with test samples was calculated.

In Vivo
Efficacy
The in vivo anti-dementia effect of
IIIM-141 was assessed using two behavioral tests: (a) intra-cerebroventricular
STZ-induced dementia in SD rats using MWM test;17,23 and (b) scopolamine-induced dementia in SAM using passive avoidance
test.18

MWM Test in SD Rats
Animals were randomized into four
groups (G1 to G4) based on body weight, with each group consisting
of five to seven rats. The entire study duration was 18 days. On days
1 and 3, aCSF (147 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1.6 mM MgCl2, 1.7
mM CaCl2, and 2.2 mM dextrose) was injected to group G1
animals. STZ (3 mg/kg) was administered on days 1 and 3 through the
ICV route to animals from G2–G5 groups. The treatment was performed
from 15th–18th day, wherein the vehicle (0.25% carboxymethyl
cellulose, p.o.) was administered to G1–G2 animals, and the
test item IIIM-141 (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered to G3–G4
animals. The rats were subjected to MWM test, 30 min after dosing
comprising 4 trials for 4 days, conducted on each day from the 15th
to 18th day. The rats were put for 90 s in a circular water pool and
were observed for their ability to locate the hidden platform in the
pool. If the animal failed to locate the hidden platform in the stipulated
time, they were gently pushed to the hidden platform and kept on the
platform for 20 s. Time (seconds) to locate the hidden platform was
recorded as “escape latency” (latency time). The escape
latency was recorded for retention session (i.e., from day 16–18).
The difference (% change) in escape latency was compared with the
G1 group. The % change in the latency time was analyzed and compared
with G1 by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey
test.

Passive Avoidance Test in SAM
Animals were randomized
into five groups according to their body weight, with each group consisting
of six to eight mice. The total study duration was 8 days, and the
treatment plan was from the first to seventh day. The groups G1, G2,
and G5 served as the negative control, vehicle control, and positive
control, respectively. During the treatment plan, 0.25% CMC was administered
to G1 and G2. Furthermore, 50 and 100 mg/kg of IIIM-141 were administered
perorally to G3 and G4 animals. G5 was the positive control group,
which received rivastigmine 2 mg/kg, p.o. On the seventh day, the
groups G2–G5 received scopolamine (3 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal
injection just after administration of the vehicle/test item. All
animals were habituated to the experimental apparatus before the initiation
of the experiment by placing them in the light compartment of the
apparatus. After 5 s, the guillotine door was opened and the animals
were allowed to enter the dark compartment without giving the shock.
Animals that took more than 100 s to enter the dark room were eliminated
from the experiment. For acquisition trial, the animals were placed
in the light compartment and allowed to enter the dark compartment
through guillotine door. As soon as the animal entered the dark compartment,
the door was closed, and the animal was delivered a foot shock (0.5
mA current) for the duration of 5 s. Animals were then removed from
the apparatus after 20 s and placed temporarily in its home cage.
The same procedure was repeated with an interval of 5 min between
acquisition trials, till the animal remained in the light compartment
for 120 s consecutively. During the retention trial, on day 2, retention
of animals in the dark chamber was recorded without any shock. Increase
in the transfer latency time from the light to dark chamber indicated
learning in animals. The data were acquired and compared with the
control as the transfer latency (in seconds), that is, the time taken
by each mouse to move from the light to dark compartment. The % change
in transfer latency as compared with the control on the retention
trial was calculated. The G2 group which received scopolamine was
compared with G1, whereas the groups G3–G5 were compared with
G2. For statistical analysis, one way ANOVA followed by Tukey test
was used.

Regulatory Safety Studies
The acute
toxicity study
of IIIM-141 was carried out in healthy female Wistar rats weighing
116–125 g, according to Fixed Dose Procedure adopted from OECD
Guideline no. 420.36 A 28-day repeated
dose oral toxicity study (as per OECD guideline no. 40737) was then conducted to determine the toxicity
profile of IIIM-141 when administered daily (at 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg)
for 28 days in Wistar rats via the intended clinical route, which
is oral. The animal body weights and hematology and blood biochemistry
parameters were assessed.

Chemical and Enzymatic Hydrolytic Stability
of Crocin
The hydrolytic stability of crocin was determined
in various buffer
solutions (pH 1.2 to 10.0), biorelevant media, namely, SGF (pH 1.2)
and SIF (pH 6.8), rat plasma, human saliva, and in the presence of
enzymes viz. esterase and lipase.38

Formulation
Development, in Vitro Dissolution, and Characterization
The
polymeric granules of IIIM-141 with various SR polymers were
prepared by weight granulation by mixing the extracts and polymers
in a mortar and pestle in geometric proportions. HPMC-K4M, HPMC-K15M,
ethyl cellulose 10 cps, and Eudragit RS100, alone and in combinations,
were used as release retardants in the range of 40–70 % w/w.
The obtained mixture was kneaded using 10 % w/w PVP-K30 in isopropyl
alcohol solution as a binder to form a dough. The dough was then passed
through sieve #10, and the obtained granules were dried in a vacuum
desiccator at room temperature. The dried granules were passed through
sieve #10 and retained on #30. The granules were collected and stored
in a desiccator at room temperature for further analysis. The polymeric
granules were assayed using the developed HPLC method for crocin-1
content. The formulation details are given in Table 4. The granules equivalent to 50 mg of crocin-1
were filled into the hard gelatin capsules of size “0.”
The in vitro dissolution of these capsules was performed using a USP
dissolution apparatus (Lab-India Dissolution Tester, model: DS 8000;
type 1—basket) by buffer change method with 900 mL of dissolution
medium.39 The extent of dissolution was
quantified from the AUC ratio ([AUC(0–t),SR formulation]/[AUC(0–t),extract]).40 The optimized formulations CSHA-14
and CSE-2 were characterized using DSC and FTIR spectroscopy to find
out the possibility of drug–excipient interaction, if any.

Pharmacokinetics of Crocin, Crocetin, IIIM-141-CEF, and SR Formulation
The pharmacokinetic study was performed in male SD rats. The oral
bioavailability of crocin and crocetin was determined by administering
them at 5 and 50 mg/kg intravenously and by oral route, respectively.
The comparative oral pharmacokinetics of IIIM-141-CEF and CSE-2 was
then performed. The plasma samples were analyzed for crocin-1 and
crocetin contents using a fit-for-purpose LC–MS/MS method with
a lower limit of quantification of 9.95 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetic
parameters of crocin and crocetin were calculated using the noncompartmental
analysis tool of validated Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 6.3).
