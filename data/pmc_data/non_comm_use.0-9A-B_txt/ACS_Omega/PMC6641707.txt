Although rather delicate on account
of their propensity to undergo
deiodination, β-octaiodoporphyrinoids are of considerable interest
as potential precursors to novel β-octasubstituted macrocycles.
Presented herein are early results of our efforts to synthesize β-octaiodocorrole
derivatives. Oxidative condensation of 3,4-diiodopyrrole and aromatic
aldehydes failed to yield free-base octaiodocorroles. Treatment of
copper meso-tris(p-cyanophenyl)corrole
with N-iodosuccinimide and trifluoroacetic acid over
several hours, however, yielded the desired β-octaiodinated
product in ∼22% yield. Single-crystal X-ray structure determination
of the product revealed a strongly saddled corrole macrocycle with
metrical parameters very close to those of analogous Cu octabromocorrole
complexes. The compound was also found to exhibit an exceptionally
red-shifted Soret maximum (464 nm in dichloromethane), underscoring
the remarkable electronic effect of β-octaiodo substitution.

Introduction
Compared to β-octabrominated
porphyrins1,2 and
corroles,3 which serve as starting materials
for a variety of other β-octasubstituted macrocycles,4,5 polyiodoporphyrinoids remain relatively little explored. Some progress,
however, has taken place recently. Thus, we have recently reported
a number of β-octaiodoporphyrin6 derivatives
and Gross and co-workers have reported several polyiodocorrole derivatives.7−9 The latter group has also reported a facile copper-catalyzed transformation
of gold β-iodocorroles to the corresponding β-trifluoromethyl
derivatives.10 No β-octaiodocorrole
derivative, however, has been reported to date.11−13 Reported herein
is the synthesis and single-crystal X-ray structure of copper 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaiodo-5,10,15-(4′-cyanophenyl)corrole
(Cu[I8TpCNPC]), the first β-octaiodocorrole
complex.

Results and Discussion
Attempts at oxidative condensation
of 3,4-diiodopyrrole with aromatic
aldehydes via a variety of methods frequently afforded low yields
of β-octaiodoporphyrins6 but at best
only traces of corroles. Accordingly, we turned our attention to the
iodination of copper tris(para-X-phenyl)corrole complexes,
Cu[TpXPC], where X = OMe, Me, CF3, and
CN.3 Periodic acid/iodine (H5IO6/I2), which we previously used to iodinate N-triisopropylsilylpyrrole,6 proved
too harsh, resulting in destruction of the Cu corrole. Attempts at
metal–halogen exchange on the Cu β-octabromocorroles
with n-BuLi or Rieke magnesium,14 followed by exposure to an iodinating agent, such as N-iodosuccinimide (NIS), proved similarly futile. Interaction
with NIS in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) led to complete
destruction of the corrole, for X = OMe and Me. In contrast, for X
= CF3 and CN, mass spectrometric analysis indicated the
formation of the desired octaiodocorrole product, Cu[I8TpXPC] (X = CF3 and CN). Unfortunately,
for X = CF3, isolation of the octaiodo product was frustrated
by the presence of large quantities of inseparable impurities. For
X = CN, on the other hand, stirring with NIS/TFA at room temperature
for several hours led to modest (∼20%) yields of the desired
product, Cu[I8TpCNPC]. The same product
was also obtained with 1,3-diiodo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin.15 Initially, the octaiodo product was contaminated
with varying amounts of the I7 and other deiodinated compounds.
Varying the amount of iodinating agent (10–100 equiv) and the
solvents (acetonitrile, dichloromethane, toluene, and mixtures thereof)
ultimately led to a protocol affording a 22% yield of Cu[I8TpCNPC] with no more than 2–3% of the I7 contaminant (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Full characterization of Cu[I8TpCNPC] was hampered by the poor solubility
of the compound in common solvents, presumably reflecting aggregation
of the molecule. Thus, 1H NMR spectra proved unobtainable
in essentially all solvents (CDCl3, CD2Cl2, 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4, acetone-d6, D2O, and pyridine-d5) except tetrahydrofuran (THF)-d8, in which a spectrum was obtained consisting of three doublets
of equal intensity, suggesting that the ortho and meta protons of
the 10-aryl group are accidentally isochronous (Figure 1). Unfortunately, the weak signals frustrated
our attempts to carry out a detailed two-dimensional NMR analysis.
The poor solubility of the compound also hindered our efforts to obtain
X-ray quality crystals. In a stroke of luck, diffusion of heptane
vapor into a 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of a ∼70:30 mixture
of Cu[I8TpCNPC]/Cu[I7TpCNPC] (the product of an earlier, less optimized synthetic
protocol) afforded crystals, which proved amenable to single-crystal
X-ray structure determination (Figure 2 and Table 1).

As expected for a sterically hindered Cu corrole,
the X-ray structure
revealed a strongly but not exceptionally saddled macrocycle geometry.13,16Table 2 provides
a comparison of key metrical parameters of Cu[I8TpCNPC] and of other, pertinent Cu corroles.17−24 Thus, despite the significantly higher van der Waals radius of I
(2.15 Å) relative to Br (1.95 Å),25,26 the Cu–N distances and saddling dihedrals for Cu[I8TpCNPC] (see Figure 2) were found to be nearly identical to those of Cu
β-octabromo-meso-triarylcorroles,19−21 suggesting that peripheral I···I interactions may
not be as repulsive as implied by iodine’s van der Waals radius.
We may further note that the present structure is somewhat more saddled
than a Cu undecaarylcorrole22,23 but distinctly less
so than a Cu β-octakis(trifluoromethyl)-meso-triarylcorrole.24 An interesting aspect
of the crystal structure is that the metallocorrole occurs sandwiched
between two 1,2-dichlorobenzene molecules, suggesting that π-stacking
interactions account for the significant solubility of the complex
in 1,2-dichlorobenzene.

The UV–vis
spectrum of Cu[I8TpCNPC] in CH2Cl2 exhibits a dramatically red-shifted
Soret maximum (464 nm), relative to Cu[TPC] (413 nm),3 Cu[Br8TPC] (439 nm),3 and even Cu[(CF3)8TPC] (459 nm) (Figure 3).27 Given that Cu[I8TpCNPC] is
in all likelihood no more saddled than Cu[Br8TPC], the
strongly red-shifted Soret maximum of the former provides a nice illustration
of the unique electronic effect of the β-octaiodo substitution.
Interestingly, the Soret maximum of Cu[I8TpCNPC] exhibits a mild redshift in pyridine (λmax = 468 nm), potentially indicating halogen bonding interactions with
that solvent.

Conclusions
β-Octaiodoporphyrinoids
are fragile molecules that readily
undergo deiodination. Careful choice of starting materials and mild
reaction conditions has allowed the synthesis and subsequently single-crystal
X-ray structure determination of the first β-octaiodocorrole
derivative, viz., copper 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaiodo-5,10,15-(4′-cyanophenyl)corrole
(Cu[I8TpCNPC]). The complex exhibits a
strongly saddled corrole macrocycle with metrical parameters very
similar to those of analogous Cu β-octabromocorroles and an
unexpectedly red-shifted Soret maximum. Ongoing research in our laboratory
focuses on developing additional, more general routes to octaiodocorrole
derivatives as well as on exploiting these unique and delicate molecules
as starting materials for new functionalized corroles.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instrumentation
4-Cyanobenzaldehyde, N-iodosuccinimide, and trifluoroacetic acid (HPLC-grade,
≥99.0%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification. Pyrrole (Sigma-Aldrich) was purified by passing
through a pad of basic aluminum oxide 60 (activity I, 0.063–0.200
mm particle size, Merck Millipore). Copper 5,10,15-tris(4′-cyanophenyl)corrole
was prepared via a one-pot protocol derived by modification of a previously
reported procedure (for which the purification steps did not work
well in our hands).28 Silica gel 150 (35–70
μm particle size, Davisil) and neutral aluminum oxide (activity
I, 0.050–0.150 mm particle size, Sigma) were used as purchased.

Ultraviolet–visible spectra were recorded on an HP 8453
spectrophotometer at room temperature in CH2Cl2. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on
a Mercury Plus Varian spectrometer (400 MHz), and high-resolution
electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on an LTQ
Orbitrap XL spectrometer.

Synthetic Methods
Copper 5,10,15-Tris(4-cyanophenyl)corrole
4-Cyanobenzaldehyde
(520 mg, 4 mmol) was dissolved in pyrrole (400 mg, 6 mmol) and to
the stirred mixture was added a solution (40 μL) of 10% trifluoroacetic
acid in dichloromethane at room temperature. After 10 min, the solution
was diluted with dichloromethane (10 mL) and a solution of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone
(1 g, 4.8 mmol) in 1:1 toluene/THF (4 mL) was added. After 5 min of
stirring, the mixture was further diluted with dichloromethane (40
mL) and extracted twice with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (50 mL each time) and twice with
distilled water (50 mL each time). The organic phase was dried with
anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated
to dryness and the residue, whose crude weight was noted, was redissolved
in pyridine (50 mL). Copper (II) acetate hydrate (1.1 equiv relative
to the crude product) was added, and the solution was left to stir
for 30 min. Upon removal of the solvent in vacuo, the solid residue
was dissolved in a minimum volume of dichloromethane and chromatographed
on silica gel column (with initially CH2Cl2 and
then with 10% EtOAc in CH2Cl2 as eluent) to
afford Cu[TpCNPC] as a brown solid (81.6 mg, 9.2%).
All analytical data were consistent with previously reported values.28

Cu[I8TpCNPC]
To a stirred solution
of Cu[TpCNPC] (5.8 mg, 0.009 mmol) in dichloromethane
(2 mL) at room temperature, was added N-iodosuccinimide
(160 mg, 0.7 mmol) dissolved (by sonication, if necessary) in toluene
(8 mL) containing a few drops of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting
solution was stirred overnight (19 h). Upon dilution with toluene
(15 mL), the solution was washed twice with water (2 × 25 mL).
The combined aqueous phases were extracted with toluene (25 mL), and
the combined organic phases were then dried with anhydrous magnesium
sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and
the resulting residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and chromatographed
on a neutral alumina column with 4:1 dichloromethane/ethyl acetate
as an olive-green solid (3.3 mg, 21.8%). UV–vis (CH2Cl2) λmax [nm, ϵ × 10–4 (M–1 cm–1)]:
464 (7.85), 567 (1.06), 668 (0.69). 1H NMR (400 MHz, THF-d8, δ): 7.58 (d, 4H, 3JHH = 8.2 Hz), 7.75 (d, 4H, 3JHH = 8.2 Hz), 7.80 (d, 4H, 3JHH = 8.3 Hz). High-resolution mass spectrometry
(ESI in methanol): [M]− = 1668.2812 (expt), 1668.2813
(calcd for CuC40H12N7I8). Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained by vapor diffusion
of heptane into a concentrated 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution.

X-ray Structure Determination
X-ray data for Cu[I8TpCNPC] were collected on beamline 12.2.1
at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The crystal, an orange lath (0.080 mm × 0.010 mm × 0.010
mm), was mounted on a MiTeGen kapton loop and placed in a 100(2) K
nitrogen cold stream provided by an Oxford Cryostream 800 Plus low-temperature
apparatus on the goniometer head of a Bruker D8 diffractometer equipped
with a PHOTON II CPAD detector operating in shutterless mode. Diffraction
data were collected using synchrotron radiation monochromated using
silicon (111) to a wavelength of 0.7288(1) Å. An approximate
full-sphere of data was collected using a combination of ϕ and
ω scans with a scan speed of 0.5 s per 4° for the ϕ
scans and 0.5 and 1 s per degree for the ω scans at 2θ
= 0 and −20, respectively. Absorption corrections were applied
using SADABS.29 The structure was solved
by intrinsic phasing (SHELXT)30 and refined
by full-matrix least squares on F2 (SHELXL-2014)31 using the ShelXle GUI.32 Appropriate scattering factors were applied using the XDISP33 program within the WinGX suite.34 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen
atoms were geometrically calculated and refined as riding atoms. Electron
density holes near the iodine atoms at the C7 and C13 positions indicated
that these atoms do not have 100% occupancy, and the occupancies of
iodine atoms at C7 and C13 (I3 and I6 in the
cif) were allowed to freely refine. The relative occupancies of these
atoms refined to approximately 85 and 80%, consistent with a ∼35%
contamination of the crystal by the I7 species. A small
amount of positional disorder was found for the iodine atoms bound
to C8 and C12. Accordingly, the two atoms were each modeled over two
sites with complementary occupancies.
