Rhodopsins
are seven α-helical membrane proteins that are
of great importance in chemistry, biology, and modern biotechnology.
Any in silico study on rhodopsin properties and functioning requires
a high-quality three-dimensional structure. Due to particular difficulties
with obtaining membrane protein structures from the experiment, in
silico prediction of the three-dimensional rhodopsin structure based
only on its primary sequence is an especially important task. For
the last few years, significant progress was made in the field of
protein structure prediction, especially for methods based on comparative
modeling. However, the majority of this progress was made for soluble
proteins and further investigations are needed to achieve similar
progress for membrane proteins. In this paper, we evaluate the performance
of modern protein structure prediction methodologies (implemented
in the Medeller, I-TASSER, and Rosetta packages) for their ability
to predict rhodopsin structures. Three widely used methodologies were
considered: two general methodologies that are commonly applied to
soluble proteins and a methodology that uses constraints that are
specific for membrane proteins. The test pool consisted of 36 target-template
pairs with different sequence similarities that was constructed on
the basis of 24 experimental rhodopsin structures taken from the RCSB
database. As a result, we showed that all three considered methodologies
allow obtaining rhodopsin structures with the quality that is close
to the crystallographic one (root mean square deviation (RMSD) of
the predicted structure from the corresponding X-ray structure up
to 1.5 Å) if the target-template sequence identity is higher
than 40%. Moreover, all considered methodologies provided structures
of average quality (RMSD < 4.0 Å) if the target-template sequence
identity is higher than 20%. Such structures can be subsequently used
for further investigation of molecular mechanisms of protein functioning
and for the development of modern protein-based biotechnologies.

Introduction
Obtaining a three-dimensional
protein structure is one of the central
tasks of structural biology. Modern diffraction and NMR methodologies
allow acquiring structures of quality that varies from average to
high. However, experimental approaches are not quick and cheap, and
even though the number of experimentally obtained structures is constantly
increasing, they are limited. The lack of experimental structures
is especially true for membrane proteins, for which crystallization
is challenging. These difficulties call for the development of reliable
computational structure prediction methods (for review, see refs (1−6)). In general, three different approaches exist: ab initio modeling,
threading, and homology modeling. In the first method, ab initio modeling,
the structure is predicted based on physical principles.7 Even though this approach is the most general,
it is not widely applicable because of its low accuracy and significant
computational resources that are required to investigate the extensive
conformational space of protein. Thus, up to now, only the structures
of small proteins have been successfully predicted using this approach.8 The second approach, threading, is based on two
principles: (1) close primary sequences fold into similar structures9,10 and (2) the number of possible structural folds of proteins is finite,11 which means that even nonhomologous proteins
can have similar structures. In this approach the amino acid sequence
of the target protein is “threaded” onto the structure
of a suitable template, then local structure rearrangement and optimization
are performed.12,13 Threading is usually not used
per se, but it is combined with other computational techniques.4 In the third and most successful method, homology
(or comparative) modeling, the structure of the protein is built based
on the three-dimensional structure of an evolutionally close template
protein.14 Close homologues can be used
as the “starting approximation” for further refinement
and model prediction.

The pipeline of homology modeling is usually
divided into four
steps: (1) finding the best template; (2) target-template sequence
alignment; (3) structure building; and (4) model evaluation. Many
statistically-driven and physically-driven alignment algorithms have
been proposed to increase the target-template alignment quality.15,16

For the structure building step, three following approaches
are
mostly used: rigid-body reassembly, fragment matching, and satisfaction
of spatial restraints. In the rigid-body reassembly, the parts of
the template that are similar to the parts of the target protein are
exerted and assembled in a proper order.4 In the segment matching approach, Cα atoms of the
shared (from alignment) residues consist of the framework that is
subsequently gradually complemented with suitable fragments taken
from the database.17 In the satisfaction
of spatial restraints approach, two types of geometrical restraints
are simultaneously introduced: template-derived and stereochemical
database-derived.18,19 More specifically, the first
approximation of the target structure is initially obtained by some
approximate method. Then the target structure is reorganized by the
minimization of violations of all restraints.

Modern homology
modeling algorithms adopt a combination of structure
building approaches.4 To evaluate the quality/limits
of such structure prediction protocols, different benchmark tests
and competitions are made.20−22 The major competitions in this
field are critical assessment of protein structure prediction (CASP)23−25 and continuous automated model evaluation (CAMEO).26 However, these benchmarks have been mainly developed for
soluble proteins. Indeed, the evaluation of homology modeling of membrane
proteins, which are the class of proteins of interest here, have not
been extensively developed. A straightforward approach to membrane
protein structure prediction is to transfer methodologies that have
been developed for soluble proteins without changes. This approach
has to be validated by extensive benchmarks. On the other hand, methods
taking into account the specific membrane protein features are emerging
and they also have to be tested.27,28

In the
present study, we performed a benchmark investigation of
several modern protein structure prediction methodologies (both developed
for soluble proteins and membrane-specific protocols). As the test
pool, we chose proteins from the rhodopsin family.29 Rhodopsins are widely spread in nature and are of vital
importance for modern technologies such as optogenetics,30 live cell imaging,31 and for the development of new biological photoswitches.32,33 Computational chemistry can help in the development of these fields
by providing rhodopsin models capable of predicting specific properties
or functions. For instance, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
(QM/MM) models have the capacity to simulate spectroscopic and reactivity
properties.34−37 For this reason, there is presently an interest in the automatic
construction of rhodopsin QM/MM models. One of these methodologies
(automatic rhodopsin modeling, ARM) has been recently reported in
the literature by one of the authors.38 However, an automatic generation requires high-quality three-dimensional
structures as an input. Consequently, given the limited number of
experimentally determined structures available for such family (only
23 crystallographic and 1 NMR unique structures), homology modeling
techniques become extremely important for developing these types of
technologies.

As reported below, we investigated several modern
homology modeling
approaches. Accordingly, the present report begins by evaluating the
impact of different algorithms for protein sequence alignment (step
2 in the homology model building pipeline) on the quality of the final
model. Then we continue by evaluating the performance of three structure
building algorithms implemented in the Medeller, I-TASSER, and Rosetta
packages (step 3 in the same pipeline). For globular proteins, Modeller,19 I-TASSER, and Rosetta demonstrated excellent
performance in CASP or CAMEO competitions. Therefore, for our tests
we choose Medeller (that is a membrane-oriented analogue of the approach
implemented in Modeller), I-TASSER, and Rosetta with membrane-specific
terms included in the force field.

To unambiguously evaluate
the quality of the final homology models,
we decided to produce homology models of rhodopsins whose structure
has been determined experimentally. In this way, we could compare
the resulting model with the corresponding experimental structure
using common metrics, such as the root mean square deviation (RMSD)
and global distance test-high accuracy (GDT-HA). Furthermore, to further
evaluate the quality of modeling from an atomistic point of view,
we carry out a comparative analysis of the conformation of the amino
acid side chains forming the rhodopsin active site. Accordingly, we
form pairs of experimental structures and use one member of the pair
as the template and the other member as a target and vice versa. Thus,
for each pair we test two generated homology models. As we detail
below, during the present study we predicted 252 homology models for
cases when target-template sequence identity ranged from 15 to 92%.
The results show that the right choice of template and methodology
allows constructing structures of rhodopsins with quality close to
the crystallographic one.

Methods
All experimental protein
structures studied in this work were taken
from the RCSB database.39

Alignment
Three
algorithms of pairwise sequence alignment
of target and template (1–3, below) and two algorithms of multiple
sequence alignment (4, 5) were tested:1. The algorithm combines the environment-specific
substitution matrices and gap penalties with evolutionary information.
The protein transmembrane (TM) region is predicted from the template
structure by taking into account solvent accessibility, S–S
bonds, and hydrogen bonds for each residue. This algorithm is implemented
in the MP-T program.40,41

2. The algorithm exploits the Needleman–Wunsch
scheme42 supplemented with specific membrane
protein information in the form of hydrophobicity profiles and template
structure topology. This algorithm is implemented in the AlignMe suite.43,44

3. The algorithm combines
evolutionary
information about the target and the template proteins in the form
of sequence profiles45 and uses information
on the template secondary structure and hydrophobicity predictions
(based on the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm). This alignment is
implemented in the MUSTER program.46

4. The algorithm is based
on an application
of hidden Markov models47 and does not
use any specific membrane protein information. This algorithm is implemented
in the Clustal Omega program.48

5. The algorithm is based
on the classical
progressive alignment protocol49 and uses
extra information about the topology and location of the transmembrane
region in proteins. This algorithm is implemented in the PralineTM
program.50



Structure
Building
Three algorithms of structure building
were tested:1. The algorithm builds the structure
under the guidance of artificial constraints. The central part of
the template transmembrane region is considered highly conserved and
it is used as the model core. Then the residues are added one by one
under specific rules which have the form of membrane-specific substitution
scores.28,51 The flexible regions are built by a segment
matching approach—the fitting fragments are chosen from the
database of crystallographic structures and the energy is minimized
after the insertion.52,53 This method is implemented in
the Medeller program.

2. The algorithm uses a combination of
different approaches. The framework is built by a rigid-body reassembly
approach; the remaining parts are built ab initio. Two rounds of replica-exchange
Monte Carlo modeling54−56 are performed for the initial model under the guidance
of knowledge-based energy function combined with spatial constraints
and the term considering the hydrogen bond network. The models from
the first round are clustered and the second round starts from the
centroid models of each cluster. This algorithm is implemented in
the I-TASSER suite.57,58

3. Also, this algorithm uses the combination
of different approaches. The framework is built by a rigid-body reassembly
approach; the remaining parts are built ab initio. Two rounds of Monte
Carlo modeling are performed for the initial model under the guidance
of a physically realistic energy function combined with spatial constraints.
The second round starts from the lowest-energy model from the first
round. For membrane proteins, the physically realistic part of energy
function changes to favor the membrane nature. The algorithm is implemented
in the Rosetta suite.59,60



Results
and Discussion
Clustering of Rhodopsins with Known Three-Dimensional
Structures
We analyzed the RCSB database39 and
found 24 unique rhodopsin structures (not including mutants, photocycle
intermediates, anion-free halorhodopsins, and halorhodopsins with
anions different from Cl–). If the database contains
several structures for the same protein, the structures of the highest
quality (Jan, 2017) were used. To cluster these proteins, we examined
all protein pairs. Two proteins were considered to belong to the same
cluster if the value of their sequence identity was higher than 40%
(the sequence identity between two proteins is defined as the percentage
of identical amino acids in the corresponding pairwise sequence alignment).
Since the identity may critically depend on the sequence alignment,
we tested the MP-T, AlignMe, and MUSTER algorithms to align each pair.
Because all algorithms gave similar sequence identity values, we used
the results of AlignMe in the clustering procedure.

We chose
bacteriorhodopsin from Halobacterium salinarum as the reference protein for starting the clustering. The resulting
bacteriorhodopsin cluster contains seven structures. Then we constructed
other cluster by examining the sequence identity using reference rhodopsins
not included in the bacteriorhodopsin cluster. In this way we generated
13 clusters in total. To label each cluster and define its distance
from the bacteriorhodopsin cluster, we selected the cluster member
with the largest identity with respect to H. salinarum bacteriorhodopsin. The resulting clusters and their distances are
color-coded (the members of each cluster are marked with the same
color) in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Rhodopsin
clusters considered in the present work. The connection
between names used and RCSB codes is given in the Supporting Information.

Construction of the Set of Target-Template Pairs
To
define a representative set of target-template rhodopsin pairs we
started with the assumption that the best pairs are found within clusters.
Accordingly, we used the following strategy. From the two largest
clusters, the bacteriorhodopsin cluster and the proteorhodopsin cluster,
we chose three pairs and two pairs, respectively (see Table 1). Note that since our main
goal was to obtain pairs with different levels of sequence identity
and since within the bacteriorhodopsin cluster the possible pairs
display only slightly different identities (excluding the pair archaerhodopsin
1 + archaerhodopsin 2), we decided to choose 3 pairs out of 21. For
the same reason, for the proteorhodopsin cluster, we chose two pairs
out of three. Three clusters contain two rhodopsins each giving three
more target-template pairs. The remaining eight clusters contain only
a single rhodopsin and, therefore, these rhodopsins had to be paired
with rhodopsins from different clusters.

In addition to the pairs
above, we also considered 10 extra pairs
formed by H. salinarum bacteriorhodopsin
and one representative rhodopsin from each of the remaining clusters
featuring a sequence identity higher than 15%. Note that even though
the homology modeling is usually performed for cases when sequence
identity is higher than 30%, we decided to investigate the “gray
zone” from 30 to 15% of sequence identity to see how modern
homology modeling algorithms work in these cases. In conclusion, our
investigation is focused on a set of 18 target-template pairs.

Comparison
of Different Methodologies
As mentioned
above, we compared the impact of three different sequence alignment
algorithms on the quality of the predicted models. The following are
the algorithms implemented in the program packages MP-T, AlignMe,
and MUSTER. Then the aligned sequences were used to investigate the
performance of three homology modeling strategies implemented in the
Medeller, RosettaCM, and I-TASSER programs (see details in the Methods section).

The performance of each
methodology was assessed as follows: the predicted models with Cα-RMSD > 4 Å or with GDT-HA < 45% from the
corresponding
experimental structure were considered a failure (these failed structures
will be analyzed later in this section). For the rest of the predicted
models, we performed statistical analysis on both the entire protein
and the transmembrane (TM) region (i.e., ignoring the outer parts
in this last case). The results are given in Table 2 and 3, Figures 2–4.

is given in brackets.

The
performance of the three structure building algorithms in combination
with different sequence alignment methodologies was compared. In Table 2, statistical analysis
of the data obtained for cases where the target and template proteins
were from the same cluster is represented (16 models from 8 target-template
pairs). The table shows that all methods provide average Cα-RMSD values less than 2.5 Å and average GDT-HA values higher
than 60% with the best values being less than 1.5 Å for RMSD
and more than 75% for GDT-HA respectively. For the TM regions these
values are only slightly higher, which means that the flexible parts
are also accurately packed in these cases. Table 3 presents statistical analysis of all successful
models. It shows that when the cases with a target-template sequence
identity lower than 40% are included, the average RMSD and GDT-HA
values do not get significantly worse. It is still possible to predict
structures with RMSD around 2 Å.

In Figures 2 and 3, the dependence
of the model quality on the target-template
pair sequence identity is analyzed for different structure building
algorithms. The results show similar trends for all three algorithms
for both Cα-RMSD (Figure 2) and GDT-HA (Figure 3) metrics. The quality gradually falls for
template-target pairs with less than 55% sequence identity. However,
it can still be quite high up to 20% sequence identity. These findings
are in accordance with previous studies that considered the comparative
modeling of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).61−63 In Figure 4, this dependence is also visualized by clustering. In this
clustering, the distance between each pair of proteins (say A and
B) is higher when the structure building algorithm produces models
of target A based on template B and vice versa, of lower quality.
We made such clustering based on Cα-RMSD (Figure 4, panels a, c, e)
and GDT-HA (Figure 4, panels b, d, f) metrics for each algorithm with the AlignMe alignment.
For cases when one of the predicted models in the pair (e.g., target
A with template B) was considered as a failure, only a single successful
result (e.g., the corresponding target B with template A) was used
for clustering, because we did not include the second value in statistical
analysis. In other cases, the two values were averaged to provide
the distance values. For cases when none of the pair members was successful,
the best of the two values was used. The analysis of these results
shows that the resulting clustering only slightly differ from the
clustering based on the sequence identities (Figure 1). Also, the obtained clusters are similar
to each other. On average, the structure building methodologies considered
in our study provide models of similar quality without notable pitfalls
even in the low sequence identity region.

sequence identity for different algorithms of homology modeling with

Figure 4 Clustering pictures of the rhodopsins considered in the present
work based on the quality of homology modeling predictions. For each
pair of proteins, A and B, the three-dimensional model of A was predicted
based on the crystallographic structure of B (AB value) and vice versa
(BA value). The AB/BA values are given along each connecting line.
For each prediction the average quality determines the reported distance
between proteins. The different panels refer to different method/scoring
combinations: (a) Medeller/Cα-RMSD; (b) Medeller/GDT-HA;
(c) I-TASSER/Cα-RMSD; (d) I-TASSER/GDT-HA; (e) RosettaCM/Cα-RMSD; and (f) RosettaCM/GDT-HA. In all cases the AlignMe
alignment results were provided.

The results show that Medeller sometimes poorly predicts
the flexible
regions (not in the TM part). For example, the Cα-RMSD of halorhodopsin from the N. pharaonis model (3a7k), predicted using the structure of halorhodopsin from H. salinarum as a template, equals 4.657 Å.
However, the RMSD for the TM part of the same model is only 0.844
Å. Another example is the case of the H. salinarum BR model predicted based on the structure of archaerhodopsin 2 (Cα-RMSD was 3.393 for the full protein and 0.654 for the
TM part).

We can see that Medeller produces models with comparatively
low
Cα-RMSD values for the TM part even when the target-template
pair sequence identity is very low. In fact, this trend is similar
for all algorithms. In general, the results show that for cases when
the target-template sequence identity is higher than 40%, it is possible
to predict structures with average Cα-RMSD values
lower than 1.5 Å and average GDT-HA values higher than 75%. The
quality of structures drops gradually in the region of sequence identity
values between 50 and 55%.

Our analysis reveals that the best
choice of structure building
method depends on whether or not tails and loops are essential for
the model. When considering the alignment provided by AlignMe, Medeller
gives the best results for the TM part. For cases when conformation
of flexible regions matter, the best choice is I-TASSER.

To
evaluate how well the “protein function” may be
represented by the selected structure building methods, we performed
a visual investigation of the amino acid side-chains forming the rhodopsin
active site (Figure 5). This corresponds to the cavity hosting one isomer of the protonated
Schiff base of retinal (i.e., of the rhodopsin chromophore). The results
show that while Medeller reproduces this functionally important part
of the protein, I-TASSER and RosettaCM gave several side-chains orientated
towards the cavity center, leading to steric clashes upon chromophore
insertion. This result is expected since Medeller uses strong geometrical
constraints during the construction of the transmembrane region. These
constraints, mostly taken from the template, allow a “memory”
effect reproducing the cavity structure of the template and, therefore,
the “presence” of the chromophore itself. On the other
hand, I-TASSER and RosettaCM algorithms are not subjected to constrains
during the energy minimization of side-chains. Thus, during structure
building, since the information about the retinal chromophore is lost
(i.e., the cavity is hollow), the most energetically favorable orientation
for the cavity side-chains is towards the center of the cavity making
the prediction of the cavity structure problematic/nonrealistic. Further
development of I-TASSER and RosettaCM allowing the inclusion of cofactors
shall improve the quality of the predicted structures in this region.
As an example, in Figure 5, we compared the retinal-binding pockets of archaerhodopsin
2 model predicted with all three structure building methods using
the crystallographic structure of H. salinarum BR as the template (sequence identity 55%).

Figure 5 Visualization of amino
acid side-chains forming the active site

homology modeling: (a) Medeller; (b) I-TASSER; and (c) RosettaCM with
AlignMe alignment. The crystallographic structure of H. salinarum BR (sequence identity 55%) was taken
as the template. The side chains of the predicted model are blue,
the side chains of the crystallographic structure are gray.

To assess how these differences
in the side-chain orientations
affect the quality of models with the inserted chromophore, we added
retinal into these models and performed a short geometrical optimization
at the molecular mechanics level in the Charmm27 force field.64 To insert the retinal chromophore we superimposed
the template crystallographic structure containing retinal on the
target model. Because the retinal-binding pockets share very similar
conformations among homologous rhodopsins, the superposition was accurate.
We could then extract the coordinates of retinal from the superimposed
template structure and move them into the target structure. Retinal
insertion in I-TASSER models and Rosetta models revealed several steric
claches of the retinal with surrounding amino acids. These clashes
were eliminated by subsequent geometry optimization . The insertion
of the retinal in Medeller models did not encounter any considerable
clashes with amino acids of the retinal pocket. In other words, even
though the conformation of several amino acid side-chains surrounding
the chromophore was wrong in the predicted models, the subsequent
insertion of retinal and geometry optimization corrected most problems
(Figure 6).

of archaerhodopsin 2 in models produced by different structure building
algorithms: (a) Medeller; (b) I-TASSER; and (c) RosettaCM with AlignMe
alignment after the retinal insertion and short geometry optimization.
The crystallographic structure of H. salinarum BR (sequence identity 55%) was taken as the template. The side chains
of the predicted model are blue, the side chains of the crystallographic
structure are gray.

Also, as it was demonstrated
in our recent work,65 an advantage of I-TASSER
models was detected when the structure
of a archaerhodopsin 3, was predicted. While Medeller predicted seven
TM helices and a long tail at the end of the seventh helix, I-TASSER
predicted a half helix and a short tail instead. Even though archaerhodopsin
3 does not have an experimental structure, the I-TASSER model seems
more realistic.

The analysis of failed models shows that low
quality predictions
occurred when the target-template sequence identity was low and, mostly,
when the target sequence was longer than the template sequence. The
example of the failed models are chanelrhodopsin (294 residues) and
thermophilic rhodopsin (251 residues) based on H. salinarum BR (227 residues), sequence identities 15 and 24% respectively.
Also, the prediction of the KR sodium pump (273 residues) based on H. salinarum BR (227 residues), sequence identity
19%, did not fail only for the I-TASSER modeling with AlignMe and
MUSTER alignment. The prediction of blue-light PR from HOT75 (232
residues) based on H. salinarum BR
(227 residues), sequence identity 25%, did not fail only for Medeller
models with AlignMe alignment. In several cases, the reverse structure
prediction also gave unsatisfying results. Finally, models from the
pair green-light PR + blue-light PR from HOT75 failed in all cases
despite the fact that these two proteins were from the same cluster.
This problem may be related to the quality of experimental structure
of the green-light PR, which was obtained using the NMR method rather
than crystallography.

Modeling with Multiple Templates
We also tested the
possibility of improving the quality of structure predictions by using
more than one template. For this purpose, we used the RosettaCM algorithm
and two algorithms for multiple sequence alignment: ClustalO and PralineTM.
The resulting structures were compared with the best models, predicted
by RosettaCM and other algorithms using a single template (Table 4).

a The results are
compared with the
best models for the same proteins produced by the RosettaCM algorithm
based on the single template and with models with lowest Cα-RMSD values and GDT-HA values obtained in the current work.

The results show that for all cases
except one, the use of several
templates decreased the model quality. This conclusion is in agreement
with the results reported by other investigators.20,28

Conclusions
We have reported on the study of the quality
of predicted three-dimensional
rhodopsin structures using different homology modeling protocols.
More specifically, we benchmarked different homology modeling protocols
on two levels: the sequence alignment and the structure building.
The quality of the predicted models was then evaluated by comparison
with the known crystallographic structures. In total, we predicted
252 structures for cases where the target-template pair sequence identity
ranged from 15 to 92%.

There are several conclusions that can
be made from our investigation.1. The quality of models predicted by
all homology modeling methodologies tested in our study gradually
falls in the region between 50 and 55% of target-template sequence
identity. On the other hand, we found that models of good quality,
especially in the TM region, can be generated even in the 20–40%
region of target-template sequence identity. These findings were earlier
reported for the homology modeling of GPCRs.61−63

2. Medeller protocol sometimes poorly
predicts the flexible regions of rhodopsins. However, the TM part
of models produced by Medeller was of high quality even when the target-template
sequence identity was very low.

3. The choice of the homology modeling
methodology depends on the requirements for loops and tails. If the
quality of flexible regions is important, Medeller protocol with AlignMe
alignment should be used. Otherwise, I-TASSER protocol with the same
alignment protocol should be used.

4. The rhodopsin active sites are predicted
correctly with all three model building algorithms. However, in the
case of models predicted by Rosetta or I-TASSER protocols additional
geometrical optimization is required after the chromophore insertion
to remove the occurrence of steric clashes.

5. Using multiple templates did not lead
to the increase of the model quality. This finding is in agreement
with the results reported in other works.20,28



Generally, the results show that up
to date the right choice of
template and methodology makes possible the prediction of rhodopsin
models with a quality close to that of the experimental structure,
which was earlier claimed only for globular proteins.6,19 Specifically, for high target-template similarity (>40%) it is
possible
to predict structures with an average Cα-RMSD less
than 1.5 Å and with an average GDT-HA more than 75% with respect
to the experimental reference. Moreover, it is possible to obtain
models with average RMSD around 2 Å and GDT-HA values higher
than 65% even for target-template pairs with much lower sequence identities
(up to 15%), but in this region one has to consider each case individually.

The results of our work can be used for the computer-aided engineering
of rhodopsin proteins with possible applications in fields such as
optogenetics and molecular imaging techniques. Indeed, the ability
to predict a high-quality three-dimensional rhodopsin structures is
an essential step for the computational investigation of their spectroscopic
and photochemical functions. For example, the homology modeling is
an important step towards a more effective automatic construction
of QM/MM models (e.g., as a recently proposed ARM protocol).36 Thus, the selection of effective homology modeling
methods together with the further development of suitable QM/MM methods
can facilitate, via rational design or random mutation methods, the
achievement of new rhodopsin-based tools for the mentioned technologies.
Moreover, the results of our benchmark may be extended to other classes
of membrane proteins, such as GPCRs, which are also extensively studied
nowadays.66,67
