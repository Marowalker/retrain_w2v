A rapid and inexpensive method to produce high-resolution
liquid
metal patterns and electronics on stretchable substrates was introduced.
Two liquid-phase gallium–indium (GaIn) alloy patterns, conductive
lines, and interdigitated electrodes, were directly written or shadow
mask-printed on a prestretched elastomeric substrate surface. Then,
the prestretched substrate was released to recover its original length,
and thus, electronic patterns simultaneously shrank on it. After these
patterns were transferred to another prestretched substrate by the
stamp printing method, the patterning resolution was demonstrated
to increase by totally 50 times for the two successive stretch–release–shrink
operations. Additionally, the resistance of the handwritten liquid
metal conductive line traces remained nearly unchanged during the
stretching process, which is believed to be feasible for electrical
connections in stretchable electronics. The rapid prototyping of a
serpentine strain sensor was successfully demonstrated to be highly
sensitive and repeatable with a stretching ratio ranging from 0 to
200%. The proposed method paves a new way to fabricate stretchable
electronic devices with high patterning resolution.

1 Introduction
Printed electronics represent
an emerging area of research that
could be widely commercialized because of the ability to bypass traditional
expensive and rigid silicon-based electronics and fabricate electronic
devices on various substrates by simple printing approaches.1−4 Additionally, stretchable electronics take the concept of electronics
one step further, where the substrate can be elongated by many times.5−7 Stretchable electronic devices can, in principle, conform to the
skin or other biological tissue or be incorporated into new form factors,
such as textiles and wearable electronics.8−10 If combined,
stretchable printed electronics can thus be used in a wider application
space while providing increased durability. Many printing technologies
have been developed to fabricate stretchable electronic devices, such
as inkjet, gravure, flexographic, and screen printing.11 Among them, special attention has been paid
to cost-effective and convenient approaches that can rapidly manufacture
stretchable electronics. Recently, an alternative strategy to directly
write conductive tracks on a substrate was reported.12−16 Direct writing with various functional materials, including metal
nanoparticles,17,18 carbon nanomaterials,19,20 and gallium-based liquid metals,21 has
been demonstrated. However, the resolution of the written conductive
tracks (approximately 500 μm according to the pen) still needs
further improvement.22−24 Gallium-based liquid metals, as a new class of functional
materials in printed electronics, were proposed as printing inks owing
to their appealing writable properties, favorable metallic conductivity,
moderate cost, and environmental friendliness.21,25−29 Nevertheless, it remains challenging to directly write liquid metal
traces with high resolution until now.30−32

Balloons, which
are popular toys, are always preprinted with various
designed figures and texts. The balloon is enlarged as air is pumped
into it, resulting in the simultaneous enlargement of figures and
text. This means that if we directly write or print patterns on the
enlarged balloon and then deflate the balloon, the pattern resolution
will be increased on the shrunk balloon. Inspired by this, we report
a new method for rapid prototyping of liquid metal microscale electronic
components or conductive patterns with high resolution on stretchable
substrates. The liquid metal electronic patterns were first handwritten
or shadow mask-printed on a prestretched elastomeric substrate surface.
The high-resolution patterns were then obtained after the substrate
was released. Additionally, liquid metal conductive lines, interdigitated
electrodes, and serpentine strain sensors were demonstrated to be
functional as stretchable electronic components by this rapid prototyping
method.33

2 Results and Discussion
The high-resolution
rapid prototyping process was first achieved
by direct handwriting method, as shown in Figure 1A. Liquid metal line patterns were directly
written with a brush pen on a prestretched rectangular thermoplastic
rubber (TPR) film, which can be stretched by 700%, as shown in Figure 1B. Then, the substrate
was gently released from 700% to its original length, followed by
line patterns simultaneously shrinking, and a video illustrating this
is provided in the Supporting Information, Movie S1. The gap between the line patterns decreased from 10 mm
(Figure 1B) to ∼1.5
mm (Figure 1C), and
the line width exhibited similar narrowing behavior. Thus, the patterning
resolution was increased by nearly seven times in this step.

and (B–E) photographs of the fabrication process
of high-resolution liquid metal patterns by (B) handwriting line traces
on a prestretched substrate, (C) releasing the stretched substrate,
(D) transfer printing the line traces to another prestretched substrate,
and (E) releasing the second stretched substrate.

The shrunk patterns from Figure 1C were transferred onto another prestretched
TPR substrate
by using the stamp printing method, where the top patterned film became
the “soft” stamp.34−36 The “soft” stamp
was gently pressed on the bottom TPR substrate and withdrawn carefully,
leaving the patterns on it. The TPR substrate was chosen here because
it exhibited better wettability and adhesion to the gallium-based
liquid metals, which is enough to maintain the shapes and structures
of patterns. Thus, liquid metal patterns can be easily printed and
transferred onto the TPR substrates without intolerable agglomerations,
which could cause pattern damages on other substrates. Note that too
much pressure in this manual transfer would cause one line pattern
merge with another, resulting in a failed transfer. Because the gap
of them became narrower, the line patterns were more likely to merge
by manual operations, and thus, the transfer process failed more easily.
After that, the bottom TPR substrate was released to further improve
the resolution of the transferred patterns (Supporting Information, Movie S2), as shown in Figure 1D,E. Generally, the patterning resolution
in the above two successive stretch–release–shrink processes
is boosted by nearly 50 times. To evaluate the minimum line width
that can be achieved from this approach, we wrote liquid metal lines
with initial width of 500 μm (Figure 2A) on a 500% prestretched substrate. After
releasing the substrate, the line width decreased to 100 μm
(Figure 2B). Followed
with the transfer printing and releasing process on another 500% pre-stretched
substrate, the final line width of the liquid metal lines was about
20–25 μm (Figure 2C). It should be noted that the highest resolution by the
proposed approach was limited by the manual operation; thus, it can
be further improved through machine assistance. This approach for
printing high-resolution liquid metal traces also makes handwriting
an effective method for rapid prototyping of high-quality liquid metal
stretchable electronics.

releasing (B), and after the transfer printing and releasing process
(C).

In comparison to handwriting, the shadow mask printing
techniques
feature delicate pattern designs, mass production, and device consistency
when employed in rapid prototyping of electronic devices. Therefore,
the shadow mask printing method was demonstrated to be feasible for
producing high-resolution liquid metal patterns on TPR substrates.
A schematic of printing high-resolution liquid metal patterns on a
prestretched substrate with a shadow mask is illustrated in Figure 3A. As shown in Figure 3B,C, the electrode
gap in the well-designed interdigitated electrode pattern narrowed
down to one-seventh of the original gap after the stretchable substrate
was released. Additionally, the serpentine line pattern exhibited
the same scaling behaviors in Figure 3D,E, before and after the release of the stretched
substrate, respectively. The serpentine line width narrowed from 200
to 50 μm in the TPR release process, as shown in the optical
microscopic images of Figure 3F,G.

electrode patterns (B) before and (C) after the release of the stretched
substrate. Photographs of the printed serpentine line patterns (D)

microscopic images of the printed serpentine line patterns.

After the liquid metal ink was written on the substrate,
a gallium
oxide skin formed on the surface of line traces, allowing the written
pattern to maintain its shape. Because the liquid metal traces have
both low fluidic viscosity and high surface tension, the printed pattern
can simultaneously behave like a solid and a liquid. The suitability
of handwritten liquid metal line patterns was further demonstrated
for conductive lines used in stretchable electronics, in which the
resistance of the conductive lines should remain nearly unchanged
when the substrate was stretched. In Figure 4A, eight parallel line traces handwritten
on a 700% stretched substrate, with the original line width ranging
from 1.6 to 2.8 mm, were chosen to show morphological evolution after
the substrate was released step-by-step from 700 to 100%. The line
width generally decreased linearly from the original width to ∼300
μm, with the stretching ratio of the substrate becoming smaller
in Figure 4B. Fortunately,
the resistance of all eight written traces as a function of the substrate
stretching ratio remained nearly unchanged during the whole process,
as shown in Figure 4C. All of these features make liquid metal line patterns practical
for stretchable electronic applications.

the prestretched substrate. (B) Line width of the handwritten traces
as a function of the substrate stretching ratio. (C) Line resistance
of the handwritten traces as a function of the substrate stretching
ratio.

In addition, a strain sensor was successfully fabricated
by handwriting
the serpentine line patterns on the stretchable substrate as a simple
demonstration of the liquid metal electronic device. It was also prestretched
by a ratio of 700% and released. The stress–strain tests were
conducted in the horizontal (Figure 5B) and vertical (Figure 5D) directions. Figure 5A shows that the normalized resistance of the serpentine
strain sensor, stretched in the horizontal direction, gradually decreased
as the applied strain increased and then increased after the strain
exceeded 400%. In Figure 5B, the normalized resistance of the sensor exhibited a monotonous
response behavior as the applied strain increased from 0 to 200% in
the vertical direction.

ΔR/R0, ΔR = R – R0) with substrate
stretching in the horizontal direction. (B) Schematics and photographs

with substrate stretching in the vertical direction. (D) Schematics
and photographs of the vertical stretching test. (E) Photographs of
dynamic tests stretching in the vertical direction. (F) Dynamic responses
of 150% strain repeating tests in the vertical direction.

According to the different sensing behaviors, the
sensing mechanism
of the strain sensor in different directions was briefly illustrated
as follows: it was known that the resistance R of line conductive
traces can be obtained by  where ρ is the resistivity of liquid
metal, L is the line length, and S is the cross-section area. Because each serpentine sensor can be
divided into long line segments perpendicular to the stretching direction
and short ones parallel to the stretching direction, the whole resistance R can be presented by  where Ll and Ls are line lengths of long segments and short
ones, respectively, and Sl and Ss are cross-section areas of long segments and
short ones.

When horizontally stretched, the length of long
segments Ll decreased and their cross-section
area Sl increased simultaneously. It was
attributed
to the fact that volume V of the line pattern is
constant during stretching, which is the product of the cross-section
area and line length. Thus, the resistance of long line segments Rl decreased. In contrast, the length Ls exhibited an increasing trend and cross-section
area Ss of the short segments a decreasing
trend, resulting in the whole increased resistance of short line segments.
When the stretching ratio is below 400%, the whole normalized resistance
changes of the sensor mainly came from that of the long segments in
the horizontal stretching direction, while the short line changes
had little impact. Correspondingly, the whole resistance gradually
decreased. When stretching beyond the critical level, the changes
of short segments started to take a dominant role, although the long
segments may still exhibit unnoticeable changes. It should be noted
that the parabolic sensing performance and low sensitivity made this
structure unsuitable as a strain sensor which was stretched horizontally.

In the vertical stretching case, the long segments always made
a significant contribution to the normalized resistance changes. When
vertically stretched, the length of the long line segments extended
and their cross-section area decreased simultaneously, resulting in
a monotonous response behavior and high sensitivity. Additionally,
the dynamic responses under an applied strain of 150% were recorded
in Figure 5E,F to evaluate
its repeatability as a strain sensor. It was highly repeatable within
a strain range of 150%.

3 Conclusions
In summary, high-resolution
liquid-phase gallium–indium
(GaIn) alloy patterns, such as conductive lines or interdigitated
electrodes, were successfully obtained. The designed patterns were
achieved by handwriting or shadow mask printing on a prestretched
elastomeric substrate surface and then releasing the substrate. With
the help of the transfer printing method, the liquid metal pattern
resolution was improved by nearly 50 times after two successive stretch–release–shrink
processes of the substrate. Additionally, the resistance of the written
line patterns was demonstrated to remain almost unchanged regardless
of how much the substrate was stretched. This demonstrated that written
line patterns are suitable candidates for conductive lines in stretchable
electronics. In addition, a highly sensitive and repeatable strain
sensor was fabricated as a proof-of-concept when used in the vertical
stretching direction. The progress made here may pave a new way to
design and build high-resolution liquid metal electronic patterns
or devices in stretchable electronics.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
4.1.1 Liquid metal ink
Gallium and indium
metals with a weight ratio of 90:10, according to the chemical composition
of GaIn10 alloy, were purchased from Shenyang Northeast Nonferrous
Metal Market Co., Ltd. (Shenyang, China) and used as the conductive
ink. The GaIn10 liquid metal ink was stirred for 10 min with a stir
speed of 200 rpm to obtain a composite of GaIn10 alloy and a small
amount of uniformly dispersed gallium oxide with appropriate viscosity.

4.1.2 Stretchable substrate
TPR elastomer
was purchased from Walmart Supermarket and chosen as the substrate
material due to its highly stretchable property. Rectangular TPR films
cut from a TPR inflatable jelly balloon ball were directly used for
direct writing after scrubbing with ethyl alcohol.

4.1.3 Equipment
The stretching machine
was constructed in the laboratory by combining a sliding rail (model:
1024, purchased from Taizhou Hengchuang Transmission Technology Co.,
Ltd.) with a stepping motor (model: 86BYG250H, purchased from Shenzhen
Yixing Electronic Co., Ltd.) with a maximum output torque of 12 N
m. The resistance of the liquid metal patterns was measured using
an Agilent 34401A Digital Multimeter. The automatic continuous measurement
and data recording was implemented by executing the Python script
written in the Spyder platform.

4.2 Direct Writing Process
Line patterns
were directly written on the TPR films with a brush pen for simple
functional demonstration, in which the TPR film was first stretched
up to 700%. The original line width was 2 ± 0.5 mm with a line
gap of approximately 10 mm. Afterward, the stretched film with written
patterns was released, and thus, the pattern shrank to one-seventh
of its original size with a line width of 275 ± 75 μm and
a line gap of less than 1.5 mm.

Then, we transfer printed the
line pattern to another TPR film stretched up to 700%. When the stretched
film was released, the pattern shrank to a further decreased size.
The optical microscopic image showed that the line width was reduced
to approximately 37.5 ± 12.5 μm and the line gap was reduced
to 200 μm. Thus, the printing resolution was increased by nearly
50 times through the above two simple steps. The final line width
would be wider than the theoretical calculated value because the line
traces were widened during the transfer printing operation. Generally,
the pattern size could be reduced further by repeating the transfer
step. However, overlap of line traces would occur during manual transfer
printing because of the narrow line gaps.

Complex patterns,
like interdigitated electrodes and serpentine
lines, could also be directly written by using a brush pen. Additionally,
the transfer printing method could be used to improve the resolution
of complex patterns, just like with the line pattern writing process.

4.3 Shadow Mask Printing Process
The
patterns on the shadow mask were designed in CorelDRAW Graphical Suite
X7. The line width of the interdigitated electrode pattern was set
to 200 μm, and the gap distance was 1 mm. The line width of
the serpentine line pattern was 200 μm, and the gap was 5 mm.
Then, the shadow mask was fabricated by laser cutting the stainless
steel sheet with a thickness of 100 μm. The obtained shadow
mask, the painting pen, and the substrate were rinsed in ethanol for
thorough cleaning before the printing process. After that, the shadow
mask was placed onto the substrate before the liquid metal was brushed
on it by the painting pen. Therefore, the liquid metal could penetrate
the patterns on the mask and reach the substrate surface.
