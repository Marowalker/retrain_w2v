Combination
therapy is emerging as a preferable approach in cancer
therapy with minimized side effects and elevated performance. Nevertheless,
the poor targeting and drug loading of currently available drug delivery
systems (DDSs) are the main difficulties to realize preferable combination
therapy of cancer. As a result, a cancer cell membrane-decorated zeolitic-imidazolate
framework hybrid nanoparticle (HP) was successfully constructed in
our study to codeliver cisplatin (DDP) and oleanolic acid (OLA). Our
results showed positive results of the platform (HP/DDP/OLA) for the
treatment of bladder cancer (SW780). In detail, HP/DDP/OLA could enhance
apoptosis while reverse multidrug resistance in SW780 cells than free
drugs alone or monodelivery systems, which might be a suitable DDS
for codelivery of different drugs with great promise.

==== Body
1 Introduction
At present, cancer chemotherapy
is still the most widely adopted
approach for cancer therapy.1−3 However, because of the developed
multidrug resistance (MDR) in various types of cancer, the administration
of a single drug molecule usually fails to effectively control the
progress of cancers.4,5 Hence, the combined administration
of different types of drugs gradually emerged to be an alternative
for better performance in cancer therapy.6,7 Previous
studies have demonstrated that combination therapy could greatly enhance
the cytotoxicity while reducing the dosage, which significantly reduces
the unwanted side effects of anticancer drugs. The basic principle
for combination therapy is to codeliver at least two drugs targeting
different pathways, which ensure the high cytotoxicity to cancer cells.8,9 However, the combination therapy greatly relies on the assistance
of drug delivery systems (DDSs) to precisely control the dosage, proportion,
and even the sequence of loaded cargos. Considering that most of the
currently adopted DDSs are not able to satisfy the first two basic
requirements, the introduction of a well-designed DDS is the prerequisite
for effective combination therapy.2

Over the past decades, the development of a novel DDS suitable
for cancer therapy is the research hotspot of pharmaceutical science.
Various DDSs based on different materials have been developed to test
their feasibility in cancer therapy.10−12 In particular, the outstanding
merits of zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF) nanoparticles, including
high biocompatibility, low cost, and decent drug loading of different
drugs (from hydrophilic to hydrophobic), have made it suitable for
the chemotherapy of cancers.13,14 Apart from the carriers,
the tumor-homing capability of the resulted DDS is another important
issue that should be taken into consideration because the availability
of drugs is largely dependent on the tumor targetability of the DDS.15 In recent years, cancer cell membrane (CCM)
with the combination of shielding and targeting has become the most
widely studied material. CCM-modified DDSs were found to smartly home
the isogenous cancer cells with high efficiency, while at the same
time they can significantly alleviate the liver capture.16,17

Cisplatin (DDP) is one of the most commonly adopted drugs
for the
chemotherapy of various cancers.18 The
mechanism for the DDP-induced anticancer effect is to form DDP–DNA
adducts and hinder DNA transfection. However, the drug resistance
for DDP has been developed in various types of cancer, as confirmed
by many clinical observations. Moreover, the severe side effects of
DDP are also another concern, which hampered its performance in many
clinical trials. As a result, combination therapy is believed to be
an ideal regimen to minimize the MDR of tumor cells and to reduce
the DDP-related toxic effects.19,20

Oleanolic acid
(OLA) is one of the most abundant triterpenoids
in plants, which is known for its critical potentials in regulating
many pharmacological processes, especially the antitumor activity.21 It has been demonstrated that the anticancer
activity of OLA is realized through the activation of the AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, suppression of the P13K-AKT-mTOR-NF-κB
pathway, and upregulation of p53 activation and the apoptosis pathway.
In recent studies, OLA has been reported to achieve elevated outcome
with enhanced apoptosis and reduced side effects when applied with
other chemotherapy reagents.22,23

Here, in our
study, we choose DDP and OLA for combination therapy
because of their distinguished mechanisms in cancer therapy. CCM-decorated
ZIF as a hybrid nanoparticle (HP) was employed as the delivery vehicle
to load both drugs in the same system to finally construct a DDS for
the chemotherapy of bladder carcinoma.

2 Results
and Discussion
The preparation of HP/DDP/OLA contained two
successive steps. First,
the ZIF was prepared using a previous reported coprecipitation method,
during which both drugs (DDP and OLA) were loaded into the core of
ZIF to obtain a dual-loaded core. The loaded ratio of drugs can be
carefully tuned by the charged ratio. Most importantly, the abundant
Zn2+ on the surface of ZIF can serve as a linker to react
with the phosphate groups of our CCM, which resulted in facile anchoring
of CCM on the surface of ZIF to offer protection, stabilization, and
targeting for the DDS. As shown in Figure 1A, the size distribution of HP/DDP/OLA was
uniformly distributed at around 100 nm with a small polydispersion
index of 0.086. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image given
in the inset also confirmed this conclusion. In addition, the western
blot analysis of CCM and HP/DDP/OLA revealed similar protein components,
with comparable AT1R and CXCR4 detected, which provided decisive evidence
to prove that CCM was successfully anchored to the corona of HP/DDP/OLA
(Figure 1B).

of HP/DDP/OLA. Scale bar: 100 nm. (B) Comparative AT1R and CXCR4 proteins

Afterward, the stability of HP/DDP/OLA was studied to reveal the
suitability to serve as a DDS. As shown in Figure 2A, although being incubated in three different
solutions, the changes of particle size in HP/DDP/OLA were not significant.
Moreover, the zeta potential measurement in all three media also revealed
insignificant changes before and after incubation. The results indicated
the preferable stability of HP/DDP/OLA under physiological conditions,
which satisfied the primary requirement to serve as a DDS. Moreover,
the hemolysis as another parameter for biocompatibility was also investigated
to reveal the safety of HP/DDP/OLA. As shown in Figure 2B, the HP/DDP/OLA showed a concentration-dependent
hemolysis on red blood cells (RBCs). However, it was noted that at
the highest concentration of 1 mg/mL, the hemolysis of HP/DDP/OLA
was lower than 1%, which was much below the warning level of 5%. On
the other hand, it was reported that nanoparticles administered intravenously
will be dramatically diluted by the circulating blood, which was several
orders of magnitude lower than the tested ones. As a result, it was
concluded from the results that HP/DDP/OLA was highly biocompatible
to be a DDS.24

before and after incubation in PBS, plasma, and culture medium for
48 h. (B) Concentration-dependent hemolysis of HP/DDP/OLA against
2% RBCs. Data were repeated thrice and expressed as standard deviation.

The drug release profile of HP/DDP/OLA under physiological
and
pathological environments was studied. As shown in Figure 3A,B, under physiological conditions
(pH 7.4), both DDP and OLA were released slowly from the DDS, with
33.2.6% of OLA and 25.4% of DDP being released at 120 h post incubation.
In contrast, in the pathological environment, the drug release was
significantly elevated, which was 90.8 and 69.6% for OLA and DDP,
respectively. The significantly increased drug release might be due
to the pH-responsive decomposition nature of ZIF, which was beneficial
for effective cancer therapy because most of the tumor tissues were
well recognized to be more acidic than normal environments.

of DDP and OLA from HP/DDP/OLA at the pH of 7.4 (A)
and 5.5 (B). Data were repeated thrice and expressed as standard deviation.

Next, the in vitro anticancer benefit of HP/DDP/OLA
was studied
using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. As shown in Figure 4A,B, the mono delivery
system showed certain benefits on SW780 cells as supported by the
concentration-dependent decrease of cell viability. The calculated
IC50 values for DDP alone were 4.21 μM (48 h) and 2.38 μM
(72 h), respectively. The IC50 values for OLA were calculated to be
183 μM (48 h) and 142 μM (72 h), respectively. In order
to find the optimal ratio for the combination therapy, the relation
between drug ratios (DDP/OLA, w/w) and combination index (CI) was
summarized. As demonstrated in Figure 4C, it was concluded that at the w/w ratio of 10, the
CI was the lowest, which indicated that the combination effect of
the drugs was optimal. As a result, the following MTT assay was tested
using this ratio unless otherwise stated. The MTT assay at this ratio
was further tested under the optimal drug ratio. As illustrated in Figure 4D, compared to free
DDP or OLA, the combination of DDP and OLA can greatly reduce the
dosage when achieving the same cytotoxicity. The IC50 was achieved
at the dosage of 1.58/15.8 μM for 48 h and 0.82/8.2 μM
for 72 h. From the results of the above experiments, it was clearly
demonstrated that the combination of DDP and OLA was able to greatly
increase the anticancer benefit at a low dosage.

of HP/DDP/OLA (DDP/OLA = 10, w/w) at different drug concentrations.
Data were repeated thrice and expressed as standard deviation.

In order to further confirm this conclusion, the
MCTS model was
further employed to test the anticancer effect of different formulations.
As shown in Figure 5A, mono delivery systems only demonstrated moderate benefits in cancer
therapy, while the codelivery of both drugs was demonstrated to greatly
evaluate the performance, which finally resulted in reverse in MS
volume as compared to other groups. The pictures captured at the end
of the assay in Figure 5B also reached similar conclusions.

(B) of MCTS treated with
different formulations. Data were repeated thrice and expressed as
standard deviation. Scale bar: 200 μm.

Next, with the aim to test the mechanisms responsible for the elevated
anticancer benefit, the apoptosis in different formulations was investigated.
As demonstrated in Figure 6A, at 72 h post incubation under the same drug concentration
(0.82/8.2 μM), the HP/DDP group showed 43.6% of apoptosis, whereas
HP/OLA showed only 31.4% of apoptosis. In contrast, the apoptosis
in the HP/DDP/OLA group was significantly elevated to 72.3% under
the same condition. The investigation of changes in cell cycles also
revealed interesting results. As displayed in Figure 6B, the combination therapy of HP/DDP/OLA
revealed that the synergetic effects of both drugs were able to increase
the arrest in the G0/G1 phase and reduce the percentage of the S phase.
More importantly, the effect was positively related to the incubation
time. It was widely recognized that the S phase indicated the division
of cells, the arrest in the G0/G1 phase and reduction in the S phase,
both indicating the impaired proliferation of cancer cells, which
was beneficial in cancer therapy.

at the drug concentration of 0.89/8.9 μM for 72 h. (B) Cell
cycle variations of SW780 cells treated with HP/DDP/OLA for different
time intervals. Data were repeated thrice and expressed as standard
deviation.

Moreover, the reverse of MDR in
SW780 cells was further explored
by investigating the intracellular time-dependent drug accumulation
of DDP. As shown in Figure 7A, compared with the mono delivery system, the codelivery
of DDP and OLA resulted in enhanced drug accumulation in cells, which
was positively related to the incubation time. As a result, it was
suggested that the integration of OLA into the DDS could significantly
reverse the MDR in SW780 cells, which was beneficial for the accumulation
of DDP in cells for better performance. Afterward, the variations
of cellular protein levels were detected using western blot to illuminate
the reasons responsible for the reverse of MDR. As shown in Figure 7B, it was interesting
to note that the mono delivery of DDP was able to trigger P-gp overexpression
in SW780 cells, which was in line with the previous report that chemotherapy
was responsible for the acquired MDR in cancer cell lines. Most importantly,
the treatment of OLA-containing formulations significantly reduced
the expression of P-gp proteins in SW780 cells as compared to the
that of the OLA-deficient group, which were comparable in downregulating
the P-gp levels. Therefore, it was inferred that OLA could effectively
reverse the MDR induced by DDP through the downregulation of P-gp
expression.25,26

different formulations for different time intervals. Data were repeated
thrice and expressed as standard deviation. (B) Western blot assay
of protein variations after SW780 cells were treated with different
formulations for 72 h. Data were repeated thrice and expressed as
standard deviation.

Next, the in vitro and
in vivo targeting of HP was studied. The
time-dependent and competitive cellular uptake was first adopted to
study the in vitro targeting of HP. C6 was integrated into the DDS
to be an indicator to reveal the uptake profile of different nanoparticles.
As demonstrated in Figure 8A, it was clearly observed that the intracellular uptake of
all formulations was positively related to the incubation time, which
suggested that extended incubation resulted in higher accumulation
of nanoparticles within cells. However, free C6 showed relatively
slow accumulation in cells, which indicated that free drugs with the
hydrophobic nature could be hardly uptaken by the cells. Most importantly,
the cells treated with nanoparticles showed elevated C6 signal in
cells, which was consistent with previous reports that nanoparticles
could facilitate the internalization of drugs into cells.27,28 Moreover, it was noted that the fluorescence intensity of the HP-treated
group was 1.83-fold higher than that of the ZIF-treated group after
incubation for 6 h, which suggested the possibility of preferable
uptake of HP in SW780 cells. In order to verify this suggestion, the
comparative experiment was conducted using free CCM as the competitor.
After exposure to excess of CCM for 2 h, the intracellular C6 signals
in different groups were recorded and compared. As expected, the intracellular
uptake of HP suffered serious decline in SW780 cells after CCM pretreatment,
while insignificant changes were shown in ZIF-treated SW780 cells.
These phenomena strongly suggested that the surface-anchored CCM was
involved in the variations of cellular uptake between different formulations,
which suggested that CCM modification might be able to guide the DDS
to homologous cells with the same membrane components.29

Figure 8 In vitro (A) and in vivo (B) targeting assays of HP/DDP/OLA.
Data
were repeated thrice and expressed as standard deviation.

Surface decoration of CCM was shown to promote the accumulation
of DDS in SW780 cells. Whether this effect could be realized in living
lives was also investigated to show the potential of HP for in vivo
application. As shown in Figure 8B, ZIF and HP were labeled with ICG and then injected
intravenously to the SW780 xenografted mice. At 24 h post nanoparticle
administration, the mice were sacrificed to harvest the organs and
tumor to determine the fluorescence signals using ex vivo imaging.
In line with results in Figure 8A, the HP/ICG group showed 2.91-fold of fluorescence signal
in tumor compared with that in the ZIF/ICG group, while the intensity
in liver was only 23.5% of the ZIF/ICG group. The above observations
clearly demonstrated that the tumor-targeting nature of CCM could
not only realize enhanced cellular uptake on the cellular level but
also was capable of guiding the HP to accumulate in the in vivo tumor
tissue with reduced capture by the liver.30,31

Eventually, the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the DDS was
assessed
using the SW780 xenografted model. The changes in tumor growth and
body weight were recorded twice a day before drug administration in
detail. As shown in Figure 9A, in line with the MTT assay, the anticancer performance
of different formulations followed the order of HP/DDP/OLA > HP/DDP
> HP/OLA ≈ free DDP. From these results, we were able to
conclude
that DDS was capable of effectively delivering the drug for enhanced
anticancer outcome because the anticancer effect of HP/DDP was much
better than that of free DDP. Most importantly, the in vivo experiments
further confirmed that the combination therapy of DDP was much more
superior to the mono therapy. In addition, the variations of body
weight in Figure 9B
also gave some interesting information. First of all, it was realized
that free DDP without the aid of DDS was not suitable for cancer therapy
because it caused severe loss of body weight during the test, which
suggested that the side effect of DDP significantly impaired the health
of the subjects.32 In contrast, with the
help of DDS, HP/DDP showed almost no adverse effects on the subjects,
which was comparable to that of HP/DDP/OLA. In all, it was suggested
that HP/DDP/OLA was a highly biocompatible DDS with significantly
elevated anticancer benefits than mono delivery systems.33,34

3 Conclusions
In our
study, we have fabricated a multifunctional DDS capable
of delivering DDP and OLA in the same platform for synergetic chemotherapy
of bladder carcinoma (HP/DDP/OLA). The results revealed that HP/DDP/OLA
was a stable DDS with high biocompatibility. Moreover, HP/DDP/OLA
showed pH responsiveness with preferable tumor targeting. Most importantly,
the in vitro and in vivo anticancer benefits of HP/DDP/OLA were both
greatly elevated as compared to mono delivery systems, which could
reverse the MDR and increase the apoptosis and cell arrest of treated
cancer cells.

4 Experimental Section or Computational
Methods
4.1 Materials, Cells, and Animal Model
All chemical reagents were of analytical pure grade and from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). The SW780 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplied with 10%
fetal bovine serum. The multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model
was established using the previous protocol. In brief, equal number
of SW780 and NIT3T3 cells was mixed and seeded on 96-well plates (Corning,
USA), which were then allowed to grow into MCTS.13 Male BALB/c nude mice were subjected to tumor implantation
according to the previous report. SW780 was collected and dispersed
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to reach an intensity of 2 ×
107 cells/mL and injected to the flank of mice (100 μL)
to allow tumor formation.35

4.2 Preparation of DDS
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, DDP, and OLA were dissolved 10
mL of ethanol at room temperature under gentle stirring to obtain
a clear solution. Afterward, the methanol solution of 2-methylimidazole
was quickly charged into the ethanol solution of the mixture with
vigorous stirring for 30 s. Afterward, the mixture was allowed to
stand at room temperature for 30 min to remove the large aggregates.
The supernatant was then centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min) to obtain
the homogeneous nanoparticles loaded with both drugs (ZIF/DDP/OLA).
Nanoparticles loaded with a single drug were also prepared using the
similar protocol.36

The CCM was isolated
from SW780 cells using previously reported procedures. Briefly, cells
were subjected to repeated freezing and thawing 6 times. Afterward,
the mixture was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min) to obtain the supernatant
(4 °C). Finally, the supernatant was processed by an extruder
equipped with a 0.22 μm membrane several times to obtain the
CCM (4 °C). The protein in CCM was quantified by the BCA kit
(Beyotime, China).37

For the coating
of CCM to ZIF to construct HP/DDP/OLA, the aqueous
solution of ZIF (1 mg/mL) was mixed with different ratios of CCM by
vortexing. After being sonicated for half an hour (100 W), HP HP/DDP/OLA
was obtained by centrifuging the mixture at 10 000g for 10 min.

4.3 Characterization
The particle size
distribution and zeta potential of nanoparticles were assessed by
the particle/zeta measuring system (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern, UK).
The morphology was observed by TEM (Hitachi HF5000, Hitachi, Japan).

4.4 Stability and Hemolysis
The stability
of HP/DDP/OLA was evaluated by measuring the size changes of nanoparticles
in PBS and plasma for 48 h. The hemolysis of HP/DDP/OLA was evaluated
by determining the UV absorbance (545 nm) of the supernatant (2% RBCs
of mouse blood) after treated with different concentrations of HP/DDP/OLA.

4.5 Drug Loading and Drug Release
The
platinum content in DDS was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy
(iCE 3500, Thermos-Fisher, USA). The content of OLA was measured by
high-performance liquid chromatography (LC-2030, Shimadzu, Japan)
with the following conditions: Agilent SB-C18 880975-902 column (4.6
mm, 250 mm, 5 μm); mobile phase was 0.1% trifluoroacetyl aqueous
solution: acetonitrile/methanol mixture (17:1) = 1:9. The temperature
was 30 °C, the flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the detection wavelength
was 210 nm.38

4.6 In Vitro
Anticancer Assay
Cells were
cultured in 96-well plates and treated with different formulations
at different drug concentrations for 48 or 72 h. At the predetermined
time interval, a standard MTT assay was applied as previously reported.
To determine their synergistic effect, the CI was calculated as previously
reported.39

MCTS was subjected to
the treatment of different formulations for 4 days. The changes in
MCTS volume were recorded and plotted against time.

4.7 Apoptosis and Cell Cycle
The cells
were treated with the apoptosis kit and cell cycle kit (Solabio, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Afterward, the
cells were subjected to fluorometric analysis using flow cytometry
(ACEA NovoCyte, China).

4.8 Intracellular Uptake and
Western Blot
Cells were treated with different formulations
for different time
intervals. At predetermined time intervals, cells were collected and
washed, followed by lysis to fully extract the intracellular DDP.
Finally, the DDP content was determined as described above.

Cells treated with different formulations for 48 h were collected
and lysed by the radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The supernatant
was collected and loaded onto the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis gel for protein separation. Afterward, the proteins
were transferred to another poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane to
allow the label of corresponding antibodies. The proteins were revealed
by a chemiluminescence imager (Invitrogen iBright, Thermo-Fisher,
USA).

4.9 Tumor-Targeting Assay
Coumarin-6
was encapsulated into CCM and then employed to construct the DDS.
The C6-labeled DDS was then used to study the in vitro cellular uptake
of DDS. In brief, cells were pretreated with CCM or PBS for 2 h, followed
by incubation with different formulations for different time intervals.
At each interval, cells were collected and subjected to flow cytometry
analysis of intracellular fluorescence intensity.

To study the
in vivo tumor targeting of DDS, DiR was loaded instead of C6 and the
DiR-labeled DDS was injected into the SW780 tumor-bearing mice through
the tail vein. At 24 h post administration, the mice were executed
to harvest organs and tumor tissues and then subjected to fluorometric
analysis of intensity by the imaging equipment (Bio-Real, Geneway,
Austria).

4.10 In Vivo Anticancer Efficacy
Tumor-bearing
mice were selected and randomly grouped into five teams (n = 6). The mice were treated with different formulations at the DDP
dosage of 7.5 mg/kg and OLA dosage of 20 mg/kg via tail vein injection.
The measurement of tumor volume and body weight was repeated 7 times
before drug administration once every 2 days.
