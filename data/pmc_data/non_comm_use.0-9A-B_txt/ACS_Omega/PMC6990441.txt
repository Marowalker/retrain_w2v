Supramolecular gels have been an
area of interest in many research
fields. They provide a means to understand assembly of nanostructures,
and through the use of amino acid- and peptide-based gelators they
can give insights into the similar assembly pathways of their more
complex structural counterparts. Bio-inspired metal coordination,
such as histidine–copper coordination, in the supramolecular
assembly of these gelators is one method for furthering our understanding
and development of these materials. Metal–gelator coordination
mimics biologically relevant metal–peptide coordination, thus
influencing hydrogel self-assembly and mechanical properties, including
biodegradability, biocompatibility, tunability, and recyclablity,
while the metal coordination can functionalize the gels to allow for
widespread applications in biomedical industries (e.g., drug delivery),
waste management, and catalysis. This review aims to discuss recent
insights into the supramolecular assembly of gels involving
metal ions, as well as a few key areas of application using metal
interactions and incorporation.

1 Introduction
Amino acids and peptides
are among the most basic building blocks
in the assembly of complex structures in life. They make up proteins
that have enzymatic or transport functions, form membrane channels,
and have many other capabilities. This is often, in part, a result
of their ability to chelate metal ions. This can occur for peptides
of amino acids without coordinating side chains, such as alanine or
phenylalanine, or with coordinating side chains, such as histidine
or cysteine (Scheme 1).1 Those with non-coordinating side chains
can chelate metal ions through amino or carboxylate termini (Scheme 1a) or through terminal
amino and neighboring carbonyl groups. Peptides containing histidine
have site-specific metal ion coordination of the imidazole ring. For
example, when histidine is at the N-terminal, its imidazole ring and
the terminal amino group can form 6-membered chelates (Scheme 1b); histidine separated from
the amino terminal by one amino acid will enhance formation of
amide-bonded species and prevent deprotonation of the following amide
residues. These will have a different metal–ligand (peptide)
stoichiometry and different coordination modes.1,2 Cysteine
residues are capable of thiolate formation to bind metals; however,
this coordination is more selective. Terminal cysteine residues can
form 5-membered chelates with the amino and thiolate group (Scheme 1c) and can also form
stable bis(ligand) complexes like C-terminal cysteinyl residues.1 In-depth exploration of the various coordination
modes of amino acids can be found in other reviews.1,2

Group and Terminal Cysteine Thiolate
Metal ion coordination is one aspect of these complex peptides,
in terms of functionality; however, they can also be involved in self-assembly
and, in turn, the formation of supramolecular gels. These are
often composed of solvents encapsulated by nanostructures varying
among nanofibers, nanobundles, nanotubes, and others, which can be
investigated for further understanding of their more complex, higher
order structural counterparts.3,4 Self-assembly of amino
acid- and peptide-based gelators is commonly induced in response to
external stimuli and triggers such as pH and temperature change.5 Self-assembly occurs via non-covalent interactions
such as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding,
and π–π stacking. These amino acid- and peptide-based
supramolecular gels are key areas of development for their biocompatibility,
biodegradability, and tunability.3−6 More in-depth exploration of peptide self-assembly
and gelation can be found in other reviews.3,4,6

By considering both the metal–ligand
coordination and supramolecular
assembly potential of amino acids and peptides during gelator design,
a different controlling factor in gel formation becomes integral to
these biomaterials.7,8 There are times when the addition
of metals can cause supramolecular gelation from originally
non-gelating compounds. This can occur due to the metal–gelator
interactions causing more ordered aggregation and orientation, thus
giving rise to enhanced gel stability.7,8 Gelation temperatures
can be dependent on metal ion concentrations, while gel strength and
robustness can change upon addition of metal ions.7 Metal ions play important roles in structural integrity
and biological functionality, and so incorporation of metals into
gel design could impart similar properties.9 Metal complexation itself can lead to different functional properties,
and in supramolecular gels this can result in catalytic, spectroscopic,
as well as redox-active biomaterials, particularly with transition
metal complexes.7 This review aims to present
the importance of peptide–metal coordination in supramolecular
chemistry, with a focus on gelation and some applications of these
biomaterials.

2 Metal Ions in the Supramolecular
Chemistry of
Gelation
The use of metals to induce gelation, as in triggering
sol–gel
transition, has been demonstrated in the literature.8,9 Beyond sol–gel transitions, metal incorporation into supramolecular
gels has also resulted in stimuli-responsiveness, luminescence, and
other properties.10,11 The merging of metals and gels
has been explored with metal–organic frameworks and polymer
gels,12 as well as with metallopolymers.13 However, this review aims to spotlight the influence
of metal ion coordination on supramolecular peptide gels. The
metal–peptide coordination forms specific orientations, which
can allow for non-covalent interactions between the peptide motifs
of the gelators. Thus, this section focuses on the effects of metal
ions on self-assembled structures, which in turn can affect gelation
as well as the mechanical properties of these biomaterials.

2.1 Metal Ions in Self-Assembly
Given
the various potential triggers for self-assembly, metal ions have
been introduced as a controlling factor in self-assembly and formation
of supramolecular gels. They can be used to tune the properties
of these biomaterials rather than just acting as fortuitous gel triggers.
The functional groups present in peptide-based gelators allow metal
coordination to occur. As such, this coordination can influence the
supramolecular structural network (Figure 1). With systematic exploration of metal–peptide
gelator coordination, these biomaterials can be tuned to obtain desired
properties from the resulting library of supramolecular states
and assemblies. A brief exploration of the short peptide hydrogelator
fluoroenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and carbazole-protected
Phe-Phe-Asp has been reported by Martin and co-workers.9 For these gelators, Asp was incorporated to aid
metal binding through chelating effects along with the terminal carboxylate.
Sodium, calcium, and copper chloride salts induced gelation and could
be used to fine-tune fiber morphology. The monovalent cation formed
sparse, heterogeneous networks with both gelators (fibers and precipitates),
whereas the divalent cations formed denser, more cross-linked fibrous
networks with the gelators. In this case, the choice of metal ions
was able to affect the density and widths of the self-assembled nanostructures.
This demonstrates the fine-tuning effects of metal ions on the self-assembly
of peptide hydrogelators, which allows for targeted optimization of
the resulting materials.

(A), Gly-His-Lys
(B), and Gly-His-Lys coordinated with copper ion (C). (b) Changes
in the morphology of the tripeptides’ self-assembly (A, B),
their co-assembly (A+B), and their co-assembly with copper coordination
(A+C), which also resulted in hydrogel formation. This figure was
adapted and reproduced from ref (14). Published 2017 by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

In addition to these minute effects, metal ions
have also been
shown to completely change the morphologies of the self-assembled
peptides. Abul-Haija et al. used copper ions to complex two tripeptides
(Phe-Phe-Asp and Gly-His-Lys) into cooperative co-assembly of a hydrogel
(Figure 1a).14 The tripeptides, both on their own and when
combined, were unable to form supramolecular gels, although
self-assembly was observed through transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) imaging of their nanostructures (Figure 1b). With the addition of copper ions, a change
in the co-assembled nanotapes to nanofibers was found, along with
hydrogel formation (Figure 1b). This was described to occur due to the peptide complexation
with the copper ions, such as in the tripeptide Gly-His-Lys through
histidine’s imidazole, the terminal amine, and the amide group
(Figure 1a). This demonstrates
the possible structural reconfiguration of self- and co-assemblies
of peptides due to ion sensitivities and metal coordination. The Gazit
group explored the effects of metal ions on the thoroughly studied
Fmoc-Phe-Phe motif of Alzheimer’s β-amyloid polypeptide.15 Specifically, they examined the transformation
of the amyloid-like β-sheet self-assembly to superhelix or random
coil structures (Figure 2) by adding metal ions with different valences, as well as altering
the ratios of gelator to ion, through circular dichroism. Through
TEM it was observed that trivalent metallogels formed spherical
structures, which was attributed to strong peptide–metal ion
binding enhancing hydrophobic interactions, thus preventing the transition
of the spheres into nanofibrils. Monovalent and divalent metallogels
formed entangled nanofibrous networks characteristic of the dipeptide
motif, with varying sizes at different peptide-to-metal ion ratios.
The differences found in the morphologies suggest the susceptibility
of the self-assembly of this motif to peptide–metal coordination
and interactions.

2.2 Metal Ions Affecting Mechanical Properties
The influence of metal ions on self-assembly can also have resulting
effects on the mechanical properties of the formed hydrogels. Chen
et al. reported an amphiphilic histidine derivative (LHC18) capable
of forming a hydro-metallogel with ferric ions that exhibited
shear-triggered self-healing and shrinkage (see Figure 3).16 Resting hydro-metallogels
underwent shrinkage, whereas collapsed gels that self-healed and recovered
into the gel phase did not. Flexibility in the metal–ligand
interactions is a plausible factor that allowed for the shrinkage
and thixotropic properties. The morphologies of these supramolecular
gels were examined under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showing
that the flexible membrane nanostructure of the ferric gels changed
into nanobelt structures after shrinking, whereas shear force destruction
and recovery of the ferric gels did not change their original morphology.
This was the first example of a metallogel exhibiting both shrinking
and self-healing properties. Many self-healing supramolecular
gels have compromised toughness and healing rates.17 In an effort to design a supramolecular material
that both is tough and has great self-healing properties, Zeng et
al. developed a highly stretchable, tough and fast self-healing hydrogel
based on cross-linked peptide–-metal ion coordination sites.17 Using a tri- (Gly-Gly-His) and pentapeptide
(Gly-His-His-Pro-His) with histidines acting as metal ion binding
sites, they demonstrated that the pentapeptide, which has a higher
coordination number than the tripeptide, as a hydrogel showed a higher
Young’s modulus and was stronger under strain than the tripeptide
hydrogel cross-linked by single ligand–metal ion bonds (Figure 4a,b). The dynamic
and tensile mechanical properties were investigated, and the pentapeptide
displayed greater stiffness and toughness without deducting stretchability
and self-healing (Figure 4c). From this, the improvement in mechanical strength of supramolecular
hydrogels through higher coordination number was demonstrated.

3 Peptide Supramolecular Metallogel Applications
The interactions of metals with these supramolecular gels
have allowed observation of assembly pathways for these unique structures
and biomaterials. In addition, the ability to incorporate metal ions
with these peptide-based materials provides a wide range of applications
(Figure 5). This section
highlights a small variety of ways supramolecular gels and metals
have potential benefits in these fields.

3.1 Peptide
Supramolecular Gels in Drug Applications
Peptide supramolecular
hydrogels present a vehicle of increasing
interest as drug delivery systems due to their biocompatibility and
likeness to biological structures and properties, such as tissue elasticity.18 Although hydrogel formation can be triggered in vitro, in vivo formation can also be
stimulated by using physiological conditions such as metal ion localization.
This aims to increase target specificity and efficacy of biomedical
applications such as drug delivery. For example, to deliver anti-cancer
drugs to the prostate, which has a high concentration of zinc ions,
Tao et al. developed a novel class of oligo-peptides.18 These short peptides have a unique forky structure due
to the presence of three adjacent glutamic residues, along with varying
numbers phenylalanine residues to aid gelation. Among these,
the hexapeptide (three glutamic residues and three phenylalanine
residues) was found to form hydrogels in the presence of zinc ions,
while not forming in other bivalent cations found in the blood or
tissue fluids. This allows for injectable prostate-targeted drug delivery,
in which there is a high concentration of zinc ions (Figure 5a). The capabilities of this
peptide were demonstrated with the anti-cancer drug docetaxel and
showed excellent anti-cancer efficacy with prostate cancer cells along
with no cytotoxicity from the peptide material to normal liver cells.
The development of this highly specific, in vivo-triggered
peptide hydrogel formation is based on targeted metal ion interactions,
presenting a new route to developing targeted drug delivery systems
based on localized metal ions.

3.2 Peptide
Supramolecular Gels in Waste Management
Water pollution is
an increasing area of concern due to the negative
impacts and consequences for human and ecosystem health due to toxic
organic dyes and heavy metals from industrial waste. In response to
this issue, supramolecular gels present an intriguing countermeasure
due to their waste sensitivity, reusability, and proper biodegradability.
Their porous fibrous structures can trap pollutants, and the peptide
basis can aid metal absorption. The Banerjee group has reported a
tripeptide-based self-shrinking hydrogel capable of removing toxic
dyes and heavy metal ions from wastewater.19 The tripeptide-based gelator demonstrated self-shrinking properties,
allowing for easy removal of water pollutants through instant syneresis.
It was observed that, after hydrogel formation of the triphenylalanine
amphiphile with Pb2+ ions, the supramolecular gel
immediately began shrinking through expulsion of water while retaining
the majority of heavy metal ions (leaving negligible amounts in the
water) (Figure 5b).19 The coordination of metal ions in these cases
entrapped them in the hydrogels, allowing for waste management, recycling,
and reuse of these simple, efficient biomaterials.

3.3 Peptide Supramolecular Gels as a Scaffold
for Nanoparticles Formation
Supramolecular gels form a three-dimensional
matrix that can serve as a scaffold for nanoparticle formation. They
can be functionalized to fabricate metal nanoparticles, resulting
in gel–nanoparticle hybrid materials. Paul et al. investigated
a diphenylalanine peptide amphiphile that formed a hydrogel
in acidic and basic pH, but not neutral pH.20 By including citric acid, they induced hydrogel formation while
also providing gel functionality to fabricate gold and silver nanoparticles
(Figure 5c). Gold nanoparticle
formation was successful through the addition of an HAuCl4 solution on top of a preformed hydrogel, with nanoparticle formation
within the gel matrix visible by a violet color change. Silver nanoparticle
formation was successful through the addition of a AgNO3 solution to the peptide–citric acid solution pre-hydrogel
formation. Upon cooling and sunlight irradiation, a yellow color change
indicated the presence of nanoparticle formation within the gel matrix.
Through this, a simple system for nanoparticle formation is demonstrated
that does not require the presence of external reducing or stabilizing
agents. The resulting gel–nanoparticle hybrid material could
then be used as a recyclable catalyst.

3.4 Peptide
Supramolecular Gels in Catalysis Applications
The incorporation
of inorganic components into hydrogels constitutes
a way to introduce unique properties such as redox, catalysis, and
photochemical properties to the resulting materials. It is of great
interest to construct metallogel-based soft, functional materials
with appropriate functionality and a suitable metal ion that can show
catalytic activity. Embedding catalytic sites in terms of a metal
center in gelator molecules has been reported to be the most logical
way of designing supramolecular gel-based catalytic systems.21 Xing et al. was the first to report a catalytic
metallogel containing Pd(II) which catalyzed the oxidative reaction
of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.22 The
catalytic turnovers of the polymer cross-linked metallogels
were twice as as those of free Pd(OAc)2, and it was reported
that the higher catalytic turnovers of the metallogels were
related to the superior stability of the catalysts under the gel reaction
conditions. Not only do cross-linked metallo-polymeric gels have the
ability to act as catalytic materials, but recent literature shows
that supramolecular gels composed of peptides and amino acids
also have this capability. Gayen et al. constructed an amino acid-based
amphiphilic gel composed of N-histidyl-N′-myristyl ethyl amine and synthesized it in such a way that
it contains the histidine imadalzole ring to bind transition metal
ions, an amide group for intermolecular hydrogel bonding interactions,
and a fatty acyl chain to promote hydrophobic interactions.23 The amino acid-based amphiphile binds with Fe3+ and Hg2+ ions separately and forms a hydrogel
at pH 6.6. This hydrogel shows the ability to act as a catalyst for
ester hydrolysis and shows an esterase-like activity toward a series
of p-nitrophenyl esters (Figure 5d).23 Other examples
of amino acid and peptide metallogels as catalytic materials
include the works by Ulijn and Marchesan.24,25

4 Conclusion and Future Outlook
There
are many different ways to trigger supramolecular gel
formation.3,5,6,9 The use of coordinating metal ions is one of the
lesser explored methods yet is no less important in understanding
the supramolecular chemistry and development of these biomaterials.
Peptide-based gelators can be triggered into forming supramolecular
gels through complexation of the functional groups with the addition
of metal ions.3,7−10 The peptide–metal ion
coordination gives rise to tunable self-assembly, from controlled
gelation to changing nanostructure morphology.9,14,15 Supramolecular metallogels have also
been found to have interesting mechanical properties, which could
be attributed to the role of metal ions in their structural integrity.16,17 However, there is still a gap in understanding the peptide–metal
ion coordination modes when in their self-assembled supramolecular
state, and so further research efforts are required in the fields
of crystallography and other spectroscopic techniques. The interaction
between metal ions and these peptide supramolecular gels has
allowed for applications in targeted drug delivery,18 waste management,19 nanoparticle
scaffold design,20 and catalysis.23 Metal ions and interactions represent an avenue
for these biomaterials that, with more in-depth exploration, holds
great potential for understanding more complex, biological structure
assembly and for developing efficient, tunable, functionalized materials.
