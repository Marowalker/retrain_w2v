Peri-implantitis
remains the major impediment to the long-term
use of dental implants. With increasing concern over the growth in
antibiotic resistance, there is considerable interest in the preparation
of antimicrobial dental implant coatings that also induce osseointegration.
One such potential coating material is fluorapatite (FA). The aim
of this study was to relate the antibacterial effectiveness of FA
coatings against pathogens implicated in peri-implantitis to the physicochemical
properties of the coating. Ordered and disordered FA coatings were
produced on the under and upper surfaces of stainless steel (SS) discs,
respectively, using a hydrothermal method. Surface charge, surface
roughness, wettability, and fluoride release were measured for each
coating. Surface chemistry was assessed using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy and FA crystallinity using X-ray diffraction. Antibacterial
activity against periodontopathogens was assessed in vitro using viable
counts, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
SEM showed that the hydrothermal method produced FA coatings that
were predominately aligned perpendicular to the SS substrate or disordered
FA coatings consisting of randomly aligned rodlike crystals. Both
FA coatings significantly reduced the growth of all examined bacterial
strains in comparison to the control. The FA coatings, especially
the disordered ones, presented significantly lower charge, greater
roughness, and higher area when compared to the control, enhancing
bacteria–material interactions and therefore bacterial deactivation
by fluoride ions. The ordered FA layer reduced not only bacterial
viability but adhesion too. The ordered FA crystals produced as a
potential novel implant coating showed significant antibacterial activity
against bacteria implicated in peri-implantitis, which could be explained
by a detailed understanding of their physicochemical properties.

1 Introduction
Tooth
loss is a significant event that can have a detrimental impact
on an individual’s well-being and social life. Osseointegrated
dental implants are an increasingly viable and successful treatment
option for restoring edentulous spaces, demonstrating success rates
of up to 96.8%.1−3 Worldwide, it is estimated that one million endosseous
dental implants are placed per year and around 110 manufacturers produce
over 440 implant brands.4

It should
be noted, however, that clinical complications or failures
do occur, and this poses a challenge to both the clinician, in terms
of management, and the patient. Implant failure refers to the disruption
between the mineralized bone and the implant. The causative factors
include chronic bacterial infection known as peri-implantitis, which
is defined as “an inflammatory reaction in the oral cavity
with loss of supporting bone in the tissues surrounding an implant.”5,6 Recent data have shown that peri-implantitis affects 20% of patients
and 10% of implant sites,7 making it a
serious challenge in long-term implant dentistry. This condition that
causes progressive bone loss could eventually lead to severe disfigurement
and poor aesthetics, which is extremely challenging to manage and
treat.8

Bacterial adhesion and biofilm
formation on the implant surface
are the essential initial steps in the pathogenesis of peri-implant
disease and the primary etiological factor of implant failure.9 Various anaerobic bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum), and Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans), have been shown to be implicated in peri-implantitis.10,11 Because of the growing development of bacterial resistance to antibiotics,
there is a considerable interest in the preparation of antimicrobial
materials.12Therefore, there is great interest
in developing an antimicrobial biomimetic implant surface that could
prevent bacterial colonization from the outset.

Bioceramics
and metals have been of particular interest to researchers.
Hydroxyapatite (HA) has long been investigated and, as a result, is
the most widely used bioceramic in medicine and dentistry because
of its strong affinity to bone tissue. This property improves the
implant–bone interface and thus favors early osseointegration.13−15 HA, however, does not possess antimicrobial properties, and its
use has declined after reports of HA coating delamination from oral
implants, resulting in poor performance and uncertain long-term success.16

As a result of these limitations, fluoride-containing
apatite coatings
have become an area of interest. Chen et al. (2006) successfully synthesized
fluorapatite (FA) crystals that resembled enamel prismlike structures,
using the hydrothermal technique. The advantage of these FA microrods
is that their composition is similar to the apatite crystals found
in dental hard tissues.17

FA demonstrates
better biocompatibility and bioactivity when compared
with HA.18−20 This bioceramic also exhibits lower resorption rates
in situ21 and has the potential to release
fluoride ions, which have osteoinductive22 and antibacterial properties.23 Indeed,
FA has been shown to improve the rate of bone apposition in early
osteogenesis.24 These promising findings
suggest that FA implant coatings may be clinically advantageous and
have led to an increased interest in the application of FA as a dental
implant coating. However, current research regarding this material
is not comprehensive.25 For instance, there
are controversies as to whether partially fluorine-substituted hydroxyapatite
(FHA; Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2−2xF2x, 0<x<1) possesses significant antimicrobial activity over HA, especially
when different bacterial species are compared,26−28 whereas the
antimicrobial efficacy of FA is largely unreported. Given the well-documented
issues of peri-implantitis, it would be beneficial to ascertain whether
an FA coating exhibits antimicrobial activity in addition to its osteoinductive
properties. In this direction, the aim of this study was to investigate
the potential antibacterial effects of FA dental implant coatings.
The null hypothesis tested was that there would be no difference in
microbial response between the coated and control stainless steel
(SS) substrates.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Production of Ordered and Disordered FA Coatings
Grade
430 SS alloy discs, 14 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness,
with smooth edges and flat surface (Ted Pella Inc, Redding, CA, USA)
were used as substrates to grow FA crystals using the hydrothermal
method17 as reported previously. Prior
to the growth of FA crystals, the SS discs were acid-etched with piranha
solution [1:1 sulphuric acid (98%)/hydrogen peroxide (30%)] for 24
h and then rinsed copiously with distilled water.

For the synthesis
of FA crystals, 9.36 g of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid calcium
disodium salt (EDTA-Ca-Na2) and 2.07 g of NaH2PO4·H2O were mixed with 90 mL of distilled
water. The suspension was stirred continuously until the powder dissolved.
The pH was adjusted to 6.0 using NaOH. Finally, 0.21 g of NaF dissolved
in 10 mL of water (pH 7.0) was added under continuous stirring to
90 mL of the EDTA-Ca-Na2 and NaH2PO4 solution.

FA crystal growth was achieved by placing the SS
discs in 100 mL
of a newly prepared EDTA-Ca-Na2/NaH2PO4/NaF mixture and then autoclaving at 121 °C under a pressure
of 2.4 × 105 Pa for 10 h. The ordered and disordered
FA coatings were produced individually on the under and upper surfaces
of the SS discs, respectively. The exact mechanism of crystal formation
and self-assembly has been extensively described by Chen et al.17

2.2 Material Characterization
2.2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy
Dispersive Spectroscopy
SEM was used to examine the surface
topography of the bare SS discs and the discs coated with ordered
and disordered FA crystals. The samples were prepared by attaching
them to aluminum stubs using carbon tabs; they were then examined
using a Hitachi S-3400N variable pressure scanning electron microscope
under low vacuum at 20 kV, and images were generated using a back-scattered
electron detector. An X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (Bruker
4030 Quantax SDD-EDS System) equipped with the scanning electron microscope
was used for the elemental analysis of the FA coatings. The 20 kV
accelerating voltage that was used allowed for the elemental analysis
of the first micron of the surface and the evaluation of the surface
fluorine content of each of the FA coatings. Moreover, a map was produced
using specific elements, for example, calcium and fluorine for the
coatings and chromium for the SS substrate, and overlaid on the corresponding
SEM image. In parallel, a line scan was produced across a scratch
made on the surface of the coatings, using a scalpel. These allowed
for the observation of the elemental distribution over an area and
over the coating depth.

2.2.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The surface chemical composition of bare and FA-coated SS discs
was
determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the National
EPSRC XPS Users Service (NEXUS) at Newcastle University, an EPSRC
mid-range facility. XPS data were obtained with an AXIS Nova spectrometer
(Kratos Analytical) using a high-power monochromated Al Kα X-ray
source. The survey spectra were acquired, and CasaXPS (Casa Software
Ltd) data analysis software was used to calculate the elemental compositions.

2.2.3 Fluoride Release Measurements
The
concentration of the fluoride ions released into the culture media
along with the media pH was determined by collecting the supernatant
of each cultured sample, as detailed in section 2.3, after 48 h of incubation and analyzing
it using an Orion 920A fluoride electron (Orion Research Inc.), following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, fluoride standards
of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mg/L (ppm F) were measured in triplicate and
used to construct a calibration curve. The supernatant of three independently
prepared substrates was treated with an equal volume of total ionic
strength adjustment buffer (TISAB) and measured in triplicate. The
fluoride concentrations in the unknown samples were evaluated using
the calibration curve.

2.2.4 3D Optical Profiler
The surface
morphology, roughness, area, and thickness of the ordered and disordered
FA coatings on the SS discs were evaluated using a white light interferometric
three-dimensional (3D) optical profilometer (Bruker, NPFLEX) operating
in the vertical scanning interferometry (VSI) mode. The instrument
calculates (1) the average surface roughness (Sa), which is the arithmetic mean of peaks and valleys or departures
from the centerline over the sampling length; (2) the root mean square
roughness (Sq), which is the root mean
square measurement of the peaks and valleys or departures from the
centerline; and (3) the maximum distance between the highest peak
and the lowest groove (Sz). The analysis
of the variation of the coating thickness enabled the estimation of
an average thickness value over the scanned surface, at an instrumental
resolution of approximately 5 nm. For the roughness and surface area
measurements, an ×50 objective was used, and for thickness measurements,
an ×2.5 objective was used. For the statistical evaluation of
the morphology parameters, three independently prepared substrates
were examined and each measurement was repeated three times on each
substrate.

2.2.5 Streaming and Zeta Potential
Measurements
The surface charge of bare and ordered or disordered
FA-coated
SS discs was evaluated in 0.01 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) using
a SurPASS electrokinetic analyser (Antor Paar). In parallel, the zeta
potential of the FA crystals after grinding, and of the bacterial
strains used, as detailed in section 2.3, was evaluated in both 0.01 M PBS and
brain heart infusion (BHI) bacterial culture medium broth (Oxoid),
using a laser zeta meter (Malvern).

2.2.6 Water
Contact Angle (WCA) Measurements
The surface wettability
of the ordered and disordered FA coatings
as well as of the SS discs was examined by measuring the WCA using
a MicroDrop analyzer (First Ten Angstroms), using the sessile drop
technique at room temperature.

2.2.7 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
XRD was used to identify the composition
of the crystal phases within
the FA coatings. The XRD data were obtained using a Philips analytical
PW3050 system with a copper Kα X-ray source (λ = 1.5418
Å), 40 kV tension, and 35 mA current. The scans were taken between
20 and 60°, with a step size of 0.05° and dwell of 1 s.
The data collected were analyzed using PC-APD diffraction software.

2.3 Antibacterial Tests
The antibacterial
properties of the ordered and disordered FA coatings on the SS discs
were examined using single species cultures of Porphyromonas
gingivalis W50 (P. gingivalis), Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953
(F. nucleatum), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 9710 (A. actinomycetemcomitans).

2.3.1 Viable
Count
Before testing, the
discs (ordered FA, disordered FA, or acid-etched SS) were sterilized
in an ultraviolet chamber (Bio-Rad GS Gene Linker UV chamber) at 250
mJ for three consecutive cycles. Starting with an inoculum of 2.5
× 108 bacteria per sample, biofilms were grown on
the surface of each disc by incubating them in BHI broth at 37 °C
in an anaerobic incubator (Ruskinn concept 1000 Invivo2, Ruskinn Technology Ltd) under anaerobic conditions (80% N2, 10% CO2, and 10% H2 atmosphere) for 48 h.
The reduced BHI broth (1 mL) was carefully added to each disc sample
every 24 h without disturbing the biofilm surface and to maintain
biofilm growth. The growth experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Each disc was then carefully transferred into 2 mL sterile reduced
transport fluid (RTF)29 and vigorously
vortexed for 1 min to disrupt the adhered biofilm and homogeneously
suspend the bacteria. Serial dilutions were carried out up to 10–6 in the sterile RTF solution, and then 0.1 mL of the
highest dilution (10–4, 10–5,
and 10–6) was spread onto blood agar plates (Columbia
blood agar base, Oxoid). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for
48 h in an anaerobic incubator, the number of colonies on each agar
plate was visually counted using a colony counter (Stuart SC6), and
the colony-forming units (CFUs) per milliliter were calculated.

2.3.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
biofilm growth experiments were repeated, and each disc was fixed
overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Afterward, the samples
were dehydrated by several passages in ethanol, using increasing concentrations
of ethanol up to 100%, sputter coated with gold, and investigated
using the Hitachi S-3400N SEM, under low vacuum at 20 kV. Images were
generated using a back-scattered electron detector and analyzed in
terms of surface coverage using ImageJ software.

2.3.3 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM)
A spectral
confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SPE, Leica,
GmbH) and a Live/Dead BacLight bacterial viability kit L7012 (Molecular
Probes) were used for the determination of the live/dead ratio of
the bacteria attached to the various substrates, 48 h post adhesion.
The attached bacteria were stained with a 1:1 SYTO 9 dye, 3.34 mM/propidium
iodide 20 mM in 0.85% NaCl. The SYTO 9 stain generally labels all
bacteria in a population whereas propidium iodide penetrates bacteria
with damaged membrane, thereby staining only the dead bacteria and
reducing the SYTO 9 fluorescence when both dyes are present. After
staining, the samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark
for 15 min and subsequently examined using CLSM. The live/dead ratios
were calculated using CLSM software.

2.4 Statistical
Analysis
Statistical
analysis of the results was performed with Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS); all data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation of the mean. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by the Student’s t test was used to detect
the significant differences (p < 0.05 was chosen
to denote the significance level).

3 Results
3.1 Material Characterization
3.1.1 SEM
and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy
SEM images showed that
the length of the FA crystals that were
prepared using the hydrothermal method was 6 ± 2 μm. In
the case of the ordered coatings, the crystals were well-aligned,
with the c-axis of the crystals arranged perpendicular
to the SS substrate, whereas in the case of the disordered coatings,
the crystals were randomly oriented.

Shown below are representative
energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps of the ordered FA coating
(Figure 1a) and the
disordered ones (Figure 1b). The EDS maps are composites of three images: (1) the secondary
electron image generated by SEM and (2 and 3) elemental maps of colored
pixels corresponding to different elements—calcium represented
by green pixels and fluoride represented by red pixels overlaid on
the original SEM image. A line scan of calcium, fluoride, and chromium
also confirms that fluorine was apparently present on the cut surface
of the substrate for a disordered coating (Figure 1c).

Figure 1 (a) EDS map of the ordered FA coating on the
SS discs, (b) EDS
map of the disordered FA coating on the SS discs, and (c) line scan
profile of a cut made with a scalpel blade in a disordered FA coating
on the SS discs.

The relative fluoride
content of each of the three surfaces, SS,
ordered and disordered FA coatings, measured using EDS, is shown in Table 1. The highest fluoride
content was measured on the disordered coating, and the results were
statistically different (p < 0.05). Apart from
fluoride (F), calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), and sodium (Na) were
detected on the ordered and disordered FA coatings but not on the
noncoated SS substrate. Only chromium (Cr) and iron (Fe) were detected
on the SS substrate. The presence of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) was
confirmed on all three substrates. The Ca/P, Ca/F, Fe/Cr ratios along
with the F (wt %) obtained for all substrates using EDS are presented
in Table 1.

Substrates

3.1.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The
chemical compositions of each of the three surfaces (SS, ordered,
and disordered FA coatings) were also compared using XPS analysis
(Figure 2). Fluoride
(F 1s), calcium (Ca 2p), phosphorous (P 2p), and sodium (Na 1s) were
detected on the ordered and disordered FA coatings whereas none of
these were observed on the noncoated SS substrate. In contrast, chromium
(Cr 2p), iron (Fe 2p), and silicon (Si 2p) were detected only on the
bare SS surface. Concentrations of other elements, including carbon
(C 1s), oxygen (O 1s), and nitrogen (N 1s), were similar on the three
surfaces (Table 1).
The XPS elemental analysis showed higher atomic concentrations of
F 1s, Ca 2p, P 2p, and Na 1s on the disordered FA coating, in comparison
to the ordered coating, whereas the Ca/F ratio was lower, as presented
in Table 1.

and (c) disordered FA coating on SS.

3.1.3 Fluoride Release Measurements
The
measurement of the concentration of the fluoride ions that were released
into the supernatant of each cultured sample in BHI showed that more
fluoride was released in the case of the disordered coating than in
the case of the ordered coating (Table 1). The concentration of the fluoride ions that were
released was not affected by the presence of the bacterial strains
tested in this study [P. gingivalis (P. ging), F. nucleatum (F. nunc), and A.
actinomycetemcomitans (A. A.)] and the pH of the suspension when compared with BHI (Table 2).

3.1.4 3D Optical Profiler—Roughness, Thickness,
and Surface Area Measurements
Table 3 illustrates the average surface roughness
(Sa), the root mean square roughness (Sq), and the maximum distance between the highest
peak and the lowest groove (Sz) of the
three surfaces (SS, ordered, and disordered FA coatings). The results
(Figure 3 and Table 3) indicate that the
roughness values of the disordered FA coating were significantly higher
than those of both the ordered FA coating and the SS discs. Nevertheless,
the ordered FA coating presented significantly higher roughness values
than did the SS discs.

(b) disordered
FA coating on SS discs.

When
compared with the ordered coating, the disordered coating
was significantly thicker and had a much higher measured surface area,
as presented in Table 3. The ordered coating had significantly higher measured surface area
in comparison to the bare SS discs.

3.1.5 Streaming
and Zeta Potential Measurements
The SPMs illustrated in Table 3 show that the SS
surface exhibited a significantly
more negative surface charge than those of both FA coatings whereas
the disordered FA coating appeared to be neutral. The zeta potential
measurements of ground FA powder in 0.01 M PBS and BHI showed that
FA appears neutral under these conditions whereas the three tested
bacterial strains (P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans) appeared highly negatively charged in 0.01 M PBS, with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis being more negatively charged than A. actinomycetemcomitans (Table 4). The presence
of BHI decreased the bacterial charges, but still F.
nucleatum and P. gingivalis appeared more negatively charged than A. actinomycetemcomitans (Table 4).

A. actinomycetemcomitans	–12.68 ± 1.82	–2.92 ± 0.53	
3.1.6 WCA Measurements
The WCA measurements
on the three surfaces showed that SS is moderately hydrophobic, with
an average WCA of 45 ± 2°, whereas the WCA could not be
measured on the FA coatings as the droplets started to spread (Table 3).

3.1.7 X-ray Diffraction
The diffraction
patterns of the surfaces are shown in Figure 4. The disordered FA crystals show a diffraction
pattern that corresponds to that of the reference diffraction file
(top and bottom traces). The diffraction pattern of the ordered FA
crystals shows the same peak positions as that of the disordered crystals,
confirming it is the same material but with different peak heights,
suggesting preferential orientation of the crystals, which was also
observed using SEM. This pattern also shows the diffraction peaks
associated with the underlying SS substrate, supporting the visual
observation that this coating is very thin.

Figure 4 XRD patterns of the substrate
and coatings compared with a reference
FA standard.

The reference file used
for the FA standard was FA reference (04-009-4021)
(chemical formula, Ca5(PO4)3F; crystal
system, hexagonal).

3.2 Antibacterial Tests
The efficacy
of the two coatings against bacteria was assessed using the CFUs counting
method, SEM, and confocal microscopy.

3.2.1 Viable
Count
The results presented
in Figure 5, using
the viable count method, show that the FA coated substrates (both
ordered and disordered) significantly reduced the viability of the
adherent bacteria, for all three bacterial strains tested (P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans), in
comparison to the bare SS substrate. In the case of P. gingivalis, the disordered FA coating reduced
the bacterial viability more than the ordered coating by 89 ±
2% and 68 ± 4%, respectively, whereas for the other two bacterial
strains, F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans, the two FA coatings (ordered
and disordered) appeared equally potent in reducing the bacterial
viability, 48 h post adhesion. In the case of F. nucleatum, the reduction in growth was 84 ± 12% for the ordered coating
and 82 ± 15% for the disordered coating. In the case of A. actinomycetemcomitans, the reduction in growth
was 96 ± 10% for the ordered coating and 90 ± 12% for the
disordered coating.

Figure 5 Effect of substrate on the retention and viability of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, as
quantified by the CFUs counting method 48 h post adhesion (the FA
coatings significantly reduced the bacterial growth in comparison
to the control p < 0.05).

3.2.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy
The
SEM results presented in Figure 6 show, in Column A, that the surface of the bare SS
substrate was fully covered by a P. gingivalis biofilm 48 h post adhesion whereas the ordered FA coating was partially
covered by bacteria, with a 32 ± 3% coverage. In contrast to
the ordered FA coating, the disordered coating was fully covered by
a biofilm that was penetrating the porous structure of the disordered
coating. This shows a significant difference between the two substrates,
ordered and disordered, with the ordered presenting better nonfouling
properties than the disordered and the bare SS substrate. Similar
results were obtained with the other two bacterial strains (F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans): the ordered FA coating presented better nonfouling properties
against these two bacterial strains than did the disordered and the
bare SS substrate. In the case of F. nucleatum (Figure 6, column
B), the surface coverage of the ordered FA substrate was 65 ±
4% whereas in the case of A. actinomycetemcomitans (Figure 6, column
C), the coverage was 41 ± 2%, compared with the fully covered
FA disordered and the SS substrates.

Figure 6 Column A shows the SEM images of P. gingivalis on (a) SS, (b) ordered, and (c) disordered
FA coatings, 48 h post
adhesion. Column B shows the SEM images of F. nucleatum on (a) SS, (b) ordered, and (c) disordered FA coatings, 48 h post
adhesion. Column C shows the SEM images of A. actinomycetemcomitans on (a) SS, (b) ordered, and (c) disordered FA coatings, 48 h post
adhesion.

3.2.3 Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscopy
Figure 7 presents
some of the images obtained using the confocal laser scanning microscope.
The green fluorescent stain represents the live bacteria whereas the
red fluorescent stain represents the dead bacteria. As in the case
of P. gingivalis examined using SEM
(Figure 6), CLSM showed
that the disordered FA coating was more populated by the F. nucleatum biofilm, 48 h post adhesion, than the
ordered coating; however, most of the adherent bacteria appeared dead.
Comparing the ordered FA coating against the bare SS, CLSM showed
that the ordered coating was more potent as antibacterial against F. nucleatum, in comparison to the bare SS substrate.

Similar data were obtained for the other two bacteria strains P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, showing that the disordered FA coating was more effective against
the various bacterial strains, but at the same time it was retaining
more bacteria in total, in comparison to the ordered one. Quantitative
analysis of these data is shown in Figure 8.

4 Discussion
To date, there has been limited research on the antimicrobial properties
of viable laboratory-produced FA implant materials. The aim of the
present study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of ordered
and disordered FA coatings manufactured using the hydrothermal method.
The effect that these coatings had on the growth of three putative
bacterial strains that are commonly implicated in peri-implant disease
was identified.10 Physicochemical analysis
of the FA crystals produced in the current study was carried out to
achieve a comprehensive material appraisal.

4.1 Formation
of FA Coatings on SS Discs
The hydrothermal method is widely
used in nanotechnology to produce
long nanorods, nanofibers, and other one-dimensional nanostructures.
Chen et al. (2006) and Czajka-jakubowska et al. (2009)30,31 showed that this process produces FA crystals that are well-aligned
and self-assemble into an ordered enamel prismlike structure. Another
way of creating these enamel prismlike analogues involves modifying
the surface of a synthetic HA nanorod, using sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)
sulfosuccinate (AOT). However, this method results in prisms that
are too small: approximately 400 nm in length and 100 nm in cross
section.30 The hydrothermal method can
create prisms that are more comparable with enamel nanorod dimensions:
1–3 μm in cross section and 50 μm in length.30 The hydrothermal method exhibits greater potential
as a manufacturing process because it allows control of the nanorod
composition and size. Therefore, the present study would further explore
this more viable method.

The data gathered in section 3.1 show that, in the case
of the ordered FA coating, the FA crystals produced by the hydrothermal
method were well-aligned with the c-axis and assembled
into an ordered enamel prismlike structure perpendicular to the SS
substrate. They were 6–8 μm in length and densely packed,
giving a 7.28 ± 0.46 μm thick coating. The disordered FA
coating comprised of FA crystals arranged in random orientations,
giving a 49.07 ± 6.58 μm thick coating.

The XRD characterization
of the SS discs, ordered FA coatings and
disordered FA coatings can been seen in Figure 3. The graph confirms the apatitic structure
of the crystals in the coatings as compared with the FA reference
peaks. This confirms that the disordered and ordered FA is crystalline
in nature, which is in agreement with the findings of Czajka-jakubowska
et al. (2009). It is well known that HA coatings deposited by plasma-spraying
contain a mixture of crystalline and amorphous crystalline phases;
in contrast, this method produces a phase pure coating. Crystalline
structures are more resistant to dissolution,32 which could be clinically advantageous.

Including the present
study, a number of authors now cite success
in growing FA crystals on SS using the hydrothermal method.31,33 Czajka-jakubowska et al. used the same method to deposit FA on titanium,
which is the most commonly used material in implant dentistry.31 The FA crystals deposited on both titanium and
SS have been found to exhibit the same composition, alignment, size,
shape, and structure31 (Figures S1 and S2, respectively). Therefore, using SS as the
substrate throughout this investigation serves a cost-effective, yet
still relevant, purpose because it is the coating that is examined
rather than the substrate. The ability to grow FA crystal coatings
on these metals shows promising signs for commercial use in implant
dentistry.

Various forms of fluoride-containing apatites have
been found to
exhibit osteoinductive properties.34,35 This is partly
due to the presence of fluoride ions, which increases the proliferation
and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells.22 Improved osteoblast numbers form bone at a faster rate, thus promoting
earlier implant osseointegration. An in vivo study performed by Dhert
et al. in goats showed that FA implant coatings are superior to HA
in favoring osteoinduction.24 FA has also
been reported to suppress the maturation of osteoclasts and inhibit
phagocyte activity, which may be contributing factors to the biocompatibility
these coatings present.36

Liu et
al. observed a favorable cellular response in osteoblast-like
cells on both ordered and disordered FA coatings in vitro. The same
group also demonstrated accelerated and enhanced mineralized tissue
formation integrated within ordered FA coatings in vivo. In particular,
after 5 weeks, over 80% of the ordered FA coating was integrated with
the mineralized tissue layer covering the titanium implants in comparison
to 40% integration in the case of the disordered FA coating.37 Therefore, ordered FA coatings similar to those
in the present study exhibit good hard tissue compatibility in vivo.
Although they promote osseoinduction, HA implant coatings have demonstrated
dubious longevity because of high dissolution rates in situ.38 With FA, replacement of hydroxide ions with
fluoride creates a more-stable and less-soluble structure. Several
authors have reported significantly less dissolution and degradation
rates in FA implant coatings compared with HA.19,21,24,39

In addition
to the current research on the osteointegration capabilities
of a surface-coated implant, there has been a growing interest in
the long-term maintenance of the marginal alveolar bone and soft tissue
health. It has been well established that the bone and the soft tissue
interface around the dental implants are strongly associated with
each other.40,41 There remains a strong consensus
among dental implant clinicians that hard and soft tissues must remain
healthy to ensure the longevity of the implant. The soft tissues that
seal around the transmucosal element of the dental implant is considered
to be a vital barrier to preventing the onset of peri-mucositis. In
a recent paper by De Wilde et al., nano HA coatings applied in the
transmucosal element of the dental implants have demonstrated no increase
in inflammation, when compared with noncoated trasmucosal abutments.42

The growth of human gingival fibroblast
(HGF) on FA surfaces showed
that FA supports the growth and proliferation of HGFs. In particular,
there was no significant difference between the number of HGF grown
on the control (SS) and FA surfaces at day 1, 3, and 14, supporting
the biocompatibility of FA coatings around the oral soft tissues.43

4.2 Antibacterial Efficacy
The CFU data
shows that all three bacteria had significantly less growth (p ≤ 0.05) on the disordered and ordered FA coatings
when compared with the acid-etched SS discs. In addition, the CLSM
images illustrate fewer dead bacteria found on the SS discs, suggesting
increased bactericidal activity in the FA coatings. It can thus be
inferred that the FA coatings produced by the hydrothermal method
significantly reduce the viability of these particular periodontal
pathogens. There are several possible explanations for the results.

4.2.1 Fluoride Ions
Fluoride is known
to affect the metabolism and growth of oral bacteria through a variety
of complex indirect mechanisms. The weak-acid character of fluoride
alters the membrane permeability to protons and compromises F-ATPase
molecules, which would normally regulate a proton gradient.23,44 Acidification of the cytoplasm follows, which results in glycolytic
enzyme inhibition, reduced cellular uptake and secretion, and a lowered
aciduricity.44 For these reasons, many
authors consider the weak-acid character of fluoride to be its dominating
antibacterial property.23

Fluoride
also exhibits direct antimicrobial action, binding and inhibiting
a number of metabolic enzymes. These include enolase, ATP-synthase,
and a number of oxidative and metallo-enzymes.44−46 The production
of intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides, such as glucan,
is reduced as a consequence.47 Deactivating
enolase blocks both the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP)
pathway and phosphor-transferase system, by halting phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP) production.44 By preventing these
particular metabolic pathways, fluoride reduces the plaque acid synthesis
as well.

Collectively, the indirect and direct actions of fluoride
on bacteria
lead to restricted metabolism and inhibited growth and may even cause
cell death.23 Looking at the data in Table 1, the EDS and fluoride
electrode analyses (as expected) identified a significantly higher
fluoride content and release in both FA coatings than in the SS discs.
It is therefore reasonable to assume that the presence of fluoride
in the FA coatings played a role in reducing the growth of all three
bacteria tested, compared with the etched SS where there were only
trace amounts. This is corroborated by Ge et al. (2010), who observed
less growth of P. gingivalis on fluoridated
HA compared with titanium and HA alone.27 However, in a recent study by Zhao et al. (2016), the antibacterial
activity of fluorinated HA against Staphylococcus aureus was found to be very limited.26 The difference
in the antibacterial potential of fluoride against various bacterial
species indicates that FA coatings would have greater efficacy against
pathogens implicated in peri-implantitis rather than against bone
infections where Staphylococcal species are more prominent and where
silver-containing apatites are reported to be more effective.26,48

4.2.2 Surface Properties
It is generally
believed that the physicochemical properties of an implant coating
may have a contributory effect on the bacterial adhesion and growth.49,50

Table 3 illustrates
that the surface roughness values (Sa/Sz) of the disordered FA discs are significantly
higher than those of the other discs. This is due to the disordered
FA coating having a thicker and uneven thickness of FA crystals on
the substrate. Supragingival biofilm accumulation is generally more
on a rougher surface, but no difference has been observed subgingivally51 and on varied implant surfaces.52,53 Furthermore, Jeyachandran et al. (2007) concluded that surface roughness
was a less important factor in influencing bacterial adhesion to a
coating, when compared with its chemical composition.28

The surface charge of biomaterials has been proven
to affect the
level of bacterial adhesion because of the inherent net negative surface
charge of most microbes54 and as confirmed
for the pathogens examined in this study (Table 4). A number of authors have observed lower
bacterial adhesion on negatively charged surfaces because of a degree
of electrostatic repulsion.55,56 The zeta potential
measurements illustrated in Table 3 show that the SS discs exhibit a significantly more
negative surface charge than do both FA coatings whereas the disordered
FA coating appears almost neutral. Despite this, by the end of the
study, significantly more CFUs of all three bacteria samples were
found on the SS discs. Gottenbos et al. had similar results, reporting
a subset of negatively charged bacilli to adhere less yet exhibit
increased growth on negatively charged surfaces.55 Therefore, it is plausible that the electrostatic interactions
had a lesser influence on the eventual colonization of the disc surfaces,
compared with other reported variables such as the fluoride content
and the surface roughness.

The process of bacterial adhesion
to the underlying surface is
multifactorial. Various surface characteristics such as fluoride content,
surface roughness, surface wettability, and surface charge cumulatively
play a role in bacterial adhesion and cellular death. The CFUs count
of both F. nucleatum and A. actinomycetemcomitans were lower on the ordered
FA coatings compared with the disordered FA, despite the latter exhibiting
a significantly higher fluoride release (Table 1). This could be attributed to the greater
negative surface charge of the ordered FA, leading to electrostatic
repulsion and reduced adhesion of these two species. The CFUs count
of P. gingivalis has been found to
be lower on the disordered FA-coated discs even though this surface
appeared neutral. The increased material surface wettability has been
suggested as one way to reduce bacterial adhesion to material surfaces.49 The decrease in bacterial adhesion to ordered
FA could therefore be partially attributed to its higher wettability
in comparison to the bare SS. The porosity of the disordered FA contributed
to the increase in surface wettability, complicating the possible
correlation between bacterial adhesion and surface wettability. Microbial
species have been found to vary in sensitivity to the antibacterial
actions of fluoride, which could explain this result.57 Indeed, the CLSM images illustrate that more dead bacteria
were found on the disordered FA; combined with the CFUs counting results,
it is reasonable to assume that P. gingivalis makes up a significant proportion of the dead bacteria imaged. However,
this could partly be due to the neutral surface charge and increased
surface roughness of the disordered FA attracting more bacteria to
be killed from the outset. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that
the disordered FA exhibits greater inherent bactericidal properties
than the ordered FA. In addition, a great number of bacteria remained
attached to the disordered FA coating as observed by the SEM, and
most of these appeared to be dead as confirmed by the CFUs and confocal
imaging and analysis. The presence of bacteria, even if these are
dead, can inhibit osseointegration,58 showing
that the ordered FA coating is a more promising dental coating than
the disordered one, even though they both show similar reduction in
bacterial growth, more than 80%, when compared with the SS.

The novel FA coatings produced in the present study show resounding
antimicrobial properties against all three pathogens involved, which
are strongly implicated in peri-implantitis. Several alternative implant
materials and coatings have been developed in the past to prevent
the surface colonization and onset of peri-implantitis. However, their
success has been limited.

Various titanium surface modifications
have been trialed. Incorporating
surface micro-/nanofeatures could downregulate inflammatory events,59 but no effect on bacterial colonization has
been observed.60 Anodization, ion implantation,
and ion plating have only been shown to modify, and not reduce, the
biofilm formation.61,62

HA coatings have produced
conflicting results. Some antimicrobial
activity has been found,13 particularly
when imbued with metal ions like silver.63−67 Other authors dispute this, citing no reduction in
plaque maturation68,69 or disease progression.70 Indeed, increased bone loss has been observed
around HA-coated implants in the presence of infection.71−73 Incorporating antimicrobial agents into HA may provide temporary
benefit, but its long-term use is not proved and uncertain.12,74

Overall, the fluoride content, rather than its release, is
likely
to be the most influential variable in reducing the count and viability
of the bacteria tested. However, as seen with the ordered FA, surface
characteristics may also have some impact on the results. It would
be useful to identify the ideal fluoride concentration, in relation
to surface charge, that confers superior antibacterial activity against
a broader range of periodontopathogens such as Prevotella
intermedia and Bacteroides forsythus.75 Incorporating titanium as the substrate
in these further investigations would enhance the clinical relevance
to implant usage. Investigating the degradation and dissolution rates
of these novel FA coatings is vital, despite other fluoride-containing
apatites exhibiting good stability.76 Kim
et al. (2003) showed that the FA composites did not show any signs
of host cytotoxicity whereas the fluoride actually had a stimulating
effect on cell proliferation and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities.77

5 Conclusion
These promising results indicate that FA produced using a hydrothermal
process may be used as a dental implant coating that shows significant
antibacterial activity against bacteria implicated in peri-implantitis.

However, the results also reflect the need to optimize the level
of fluoride in the FA coating to have optimum antibacterial efficacy
without compromising the stability and resistance to the dissolution
of the coating.
