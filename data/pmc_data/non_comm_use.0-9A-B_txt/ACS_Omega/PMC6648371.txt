Mechanochromic
luminogens are of significant importance in both
academic and technical aspects. Thus far, most mechanochromic compounds
exhibit bathochromically shifted emission upon grinding; the examples
of those that exhibit blue-shifted emission still remain limited.
Herein, a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D)-structured
conjugate, namely 4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT),
comprising benzobis(1,2,5-thiadiazole) and thiophene units, has been
carefully synthesized and investigated. DTBT exhibits typical intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) characteristics, crystallization-induced phosphorescence
(CIP), and remarkable mechanochromism. Although it merely emits fluorescence
in solutions with distinct ICT features, its crystals demonstrate
bright-red room-temperature phosphorescence (616 nm) with efficiency
up to 25.0% and generate yellow excimer fluorescence (578 nm) upon
mechanical grinding, accompanying decreased lifetimes from 10.9 μs
to 3.5 ns and a blue-shifted emission of 38 nm. These results highly
indicate the feasibility to fabricate novel CIP luminogens with blue-shifted
mechanochromism.

Introduction
Mechanochromic luminogens,
whose emission can be finely modulated
upon mechanical stimulation through the changing of molecular arrangement,
have attracted intense interest on account of their fundamental importance
and promising technical applications in memory devices, strain sensors,
security inks, and camouflage.1−10 Currently, most reported organic mechanochromic luminogens exhibit
red-shifted emissions in response to mechanical stimuli;11−15 those with blue-shifted emissions are rarely reported,16−18 despite their importance for the comprehensive understanding of
mechanisms and for summarizing the universal design principle. On
the one hand, most reported conventional emitters normally demonstrate
aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) in the aggregation state,19 making it difficult to receive intense solid
emission and consequently hard to observe mechanochromism. On the
other hand, in comparison with other stimuli (i.e., pH, temperature)
responsive materials, mechanochromic luminogens still remain in their
infant stage. Although increasing examples have been reported, general
design principles remain scarce.1−3,14,16 Further exploration of novel mechanochromic
materials with high contrast is thus strikingly desirable.

In
2001, Tang and co-workers discovered an aggregation-induced
emission (AIE) phenomenon, which is exactly the opposite of ACQ, from
twisted siloles.20,21 Many AIE luminogens (AIEgens)
can exhibit mechanochromic behaviors. Among different AIEgens, those
with crystallization-induced emission (CIE) have attracted great attention.22−27 CIE compounds weakly emit in amorphous solids but become highly
emissive in crystalline states,22,24 which makes them highly
promising as mechanochromic luminogens.2,24 The CIE phenomenon
is ascribed to the highly rigidified conformations in crystals owing
to the presence of effective intermolecular interactions, which significantly
frustrate the intramolecular molecular motions, thus depressing nonradiative
deactivations and lighting up the emissions.21−23 Apart from
fluorescence, crystallization-induced phosphorescence (CIP) was also
noticed in 2010,25,28 which offers an effective method
toward efficient room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from pure
organics. Owing to the extraordinary susceptibility of triplet states
to environmental quenchers (i.e., oxygen and moisture), CIP luminogens
are highly potential mechanochromic emitters.29−31 Meanwhile,
compared with fluorescence, phosphorescence owns much larger Stokes
shift, whose emissive maximum is even redder than the excimer fluorescence.
If the regular molecular packing in crystals is destroyed and converted
into disordered amorphous states by mechanical stimulation, triplet
excitons are readily quenched by vibrational dissipations and external
quenchers.28−30 Consequently, no remarkable triplet emission can
be expected. Therefore, destruction of CIP crystals may serve as a
general strategy toward mechanochromic compounds with high contrast
and mechanically induced blue-shifted emission.

To construct
such mechanochromic CIP luminogens, in this contribution,
a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D)-structured
luminogen, namely, 4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT, Figure 1A), consisting of
two thiophenes and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole units,
was synthesized. DTBT is highly planar with small torsion angles less
than 6° between D and A planes. It emits fluorescence in solutions
and disordered amorphous solids, but bright-red RTP in crystals, exhibiting
CIP characteristics with high efficiency (Φ) up to 25.0%. DTBT also exhibits different emission maxima in various
states with obvious mechanochromism (Figure 1B). Specifically, upon grinding, the emission
color, maximum, and lifetime of the crystals changed from red, 616
nm, and 10.9 μs to orange, 578 nm, and 3.5 ns, respectively,
displaying a blue shift in response to mechanical stimuli.

of its emission properties at varying states.

Results and Discussion
DTBT was obtained by the well-known
Stille C–C coupling
reaction between 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothidiazole and (2-thienyl)tributylstannane
with palladium catalyst (Figure 1A) in a high yield of 75%. DTBT owns good solubility
in common organic solvents such as toluene, acetonitrile, dichloromethane
(DCM), chloroform (TCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide
(DMF), and dimethylacetamide. The chemical structure of DTBT was characterized
by high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS) and NMR spectra (Figures S1–S3), with satisfactory results
obtained. For example, the reaction product gave a [M + H]+ peak at m/z 299.9854 (calcd 299.9850)
in the HRMS spectrum, thus confirming the formation of the target
adduct. Furthermore, single-crystal analysis directly suggests the
successful preparation of DTBT (Figure S4, Table S1, and CCDC 1872296).

DTBT exhibits two absorption bands
at around 308 and 446 nm in
toluene, which can be assigned to the π–π* and
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions (Figure 2A), respectively. This absorption
profile slightly varies in diverse solvents, which indicates that
its ground-state electronic structures are almost independent of the
solvent polarity. Photoluminescence (PL), however, is generally bathochromically
shifted, peaking at 550, 565, 559, 568, 576, and 580 nm in toluene,
TCM, THF, DCM, acetonitrile, and DMF (Figure 2B), with Φ values
of 52.8, 44.5, 49.1, 45.1, 35.4, and 32.8%, respectively. These results
are highly indicative of the ICT feature of DTBT.32,33 The relatively small variations in emission maximum and Φ values of D–A–D-structured DTBT in
different solvents suggest its rigid conformation and/or small change
in dipole moment at excited states. The electron densities of DTBT
calculated by Gaussian 16 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level are shown in Figure 3. Although the electron
cloud of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is predominantly
distributed on the phenyl ring and the D unit of thiophene, that of
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is almost localized
on the A moiety of thiadiazole, thus testifying the ICT nature of
DTBT.34,35

of diverse DTBT
solutions (20 μM). Excitation wavelength (λex) in (B) is 450 nm.

Figure 3 HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DTBT.

PL spectra of DTBT in solvent and solvent/nonsolvent mixtures
were
also recorded. As can be seen from Figure 4, the PL intensity of DTBT in pure THF is
so high that a prominent peak at 558 nm is recorded. With increasing
water fraction (fw), the emission intensity
continuously decreases to a negligible level when fw = 90%, which suggests ACQ nature (fluorescence) of DTBT.
It is also noted that the PL peak also changes with fw. With boosted fw, the maximum
is bathochromically shifted until fw =
70%, then dramatically blue-shifted, changing from 558 to 584 nm (fw = 70%), and then to 567 nm (fw = 90%). When fw is ≤70%,
evident signals are recorded owing to the molecular dissolution of
DTBT in mixtures. Increasing fw promotes
the mixture polarity, subsequently leading to red-shifted emission
along with lowered PL intensity owing to the ICT effect. However,
when fw is further increased to 80%, on
account of the strikingly decreased solvating power of the mixture,
DTBT molecules begin to aggregate. Consequently, a much less polar
microenvironment is formed because of the molecular self-wrapping,
thus resulting in blue-shifted emission. Further addition of water
affords more serious aggregation and even a less-polar microenvironment,
thus resulting in weakened emission with a blue-shifted maximum.

spectra and (B) peak intensity of DTBT in THF and
THF/water mixtures with varying fws (20
μM, λex = 390 nm). The inset picture in (B)
is the photograph of DTBT in THF and in 10:90 THF/water mixture taken
under 365 nm UV irradiation.

Despite DTBT showing typical ACQ characteristics in THF/water
mixtures,
astonishingly, its single crystals emit a bright-red light peaking
at 616 nm (Figure 5A,B) with a Φ value as high as 25.0%. Even
more interestingly, DTBT solids show distinct mechanochromic luminescence.
After being ground with a pestle, the red emissive crystals are converted
into fine powders, which generate an orange light with a maximum at
578 nm (Figure 5A,B),
demonstrating a distinct change in emission color with a wavelength
blue shift of 38 nm. On further DCM fuming for 3 min, the bright-red
emission is reverted. To attain further insights into the mechanism
of mechanochromism, the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurement
was conducted. As can be seen from Figure 5C, for DTBT crystals, the sharp and intense
diffractions suggest their highly ordered crystalline attributes;
for their ground counterparts, the extremely weak diffractions reveal
their predominantly disordered amorphous features. The fumed powders,
however, exhibit recovered sharp diffractions, thus implying the restoration
of regular crystalline packing. Therefore, the switchable conversion
from crystalline to amorphous states of DTBT should be responsible
for its reversible mechanochromism.

Generally, most reported mechanochromic
luminogens exhibit prominent
red-shifted emission; a dramatically hypsochromic shift is rarely
observed, particularly for those under ambient conditions. Considering
the rigid planar structure and incorporation of heteroatoms, which
tend to form excimers and promote spin–orbital coupling, respectively,
there are several possibilities for the blue-shifted emission: (1)
excimer emission in crystals and monomer emission in ground solids,
(2) RTP emission in crystals and fluorescence in ground powders. To
obtain more information, time-resolved emission measurement was conducted.
As shown in Figure 5D,E, although the pristine crystals own the ⟨τ⟩ value as large as 10.9 μs, that of the ground solids
is merely 3.5 ns, which are suggestive of their RTP and fluorescence
nature, respectively, thus favoring the second case. Considering the
absence of RTP in solutions and ground solids, the bright RTP emission
of crystals suggests the CIP characteristic of DTBT. Moreover, such
efficient red RTP emission (Φ = 25.0%) is also
rare, which renders DTBT highly promising for organic light-emitting
diode and bioimaging applications. Therefore, the mechanochromism
of DTBT should be ascribed to the conversion from phosphorescence
to fluorescence, accompanied with transformation from ordered crystalline
states to disordered amorphous states.

To gain more information
about the solid emission, particularly,
to clarify whether excimer emission is present in the solid state,
DTBT-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films with different doping
concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10 wt % were fabricated. With increasing
DTBT concentration, the emission gradually red shifted from 541 to
553 nm and then to 573 nm, with the emission color changing from yellow
to yellowish-orange and then to orange for the 0.1, 1, and 10 wt %
DTBT/PMMA films (Figure 6A,B), respectively. Such results clearly illustrate how aggregation
impacts the emission of doped films. It is assumed that in the 0.1
and 10 wt % DTBT/PMMA films, monomer and excimer emissions are observed,
respectively. Generally, compared with monomer fluorescence, excimer
emission owns much longer lifetime and decreased PL efficiency.19 To testify the above conjecture, ⟨τ⟩ and Φ values of different
films were thus measured, which are 34.2/28.6/15.3% and 4.2/8.9/12.5
ns for the 0.1, 1, and 10 wt % DTBT/PMMA films (Figures 6D, S5, and 6E), respectively. The red-shifted emission, decreased
efficiency, and prolonged lifetime highly suggest the excimer emission
in the 10 wt % DTBT/PMMA film. On account of the similar highly aggregated
states and approaching emission maxima (∼575 nm) of the concentrated
doped film and ground solids, these results strongly indicate the
excimer fluorescence in the ground solids. Meanwhile, these films
also show no phosphorescent emissions. The absence of phosphorescence
in PMMA films together with bright-red RTP in the crystalline states
duly confirms the CIP feature of DTBT at ambient conditions.25,28 Furthermore, these results imply that the above mechanochromism
should be ascribed to the switchable transformation from RTP to excimer
fluorescence between crystalline and amorphous states.

and (C, D) lifetimes of DTBT/PAAM films with different weight fractions
of DTBT as indicated.

Single-crystal structure can provide exact conformation and
molecular
packing of the compounds in crystals, thus beneficial to the understanding
of the solid emission. Single crystals of DTBT were thus cultured
through slow evaporation from its CHCl3–methanol
solution. As depicted in Figure 7, DTBT molecules adopt nearly coplanar conformations,
with small dihedral angles of 5.18 and 1.71° for the planes of
P1 and P3 as well as P2 and P3 (Figure 7B), respectively. Despite their almost planar conformation,
there are no strong π–π stackings between adjacent
DTBT molecules because of their perpendicular or slipped parallel
packings. Specifically, noncovalent intermolecular electronic communications
of C–H···π (2.840 Å) among adjacent
molecules and intramolecular short contacts of S···N
(2.879 Å) are present in crystals (Figure 7C). On the one hand, these contacts further
rigidify the conformations; on the other hand, the presence of heteroatoms
and S···N contacts could promote the n−π*
transition, orbital coupling, and consequently intersystem crossing
(ISC) process, thus favorable for the generation of RTP emission.36,37 Promoted ISC process, rigid planar structure, and absence of intense
π···π contacts render DTBT in crystals
highly RTP-emissive. Upon manual grinding, intermolecular short contacts
are destroyed and triplet excitons tend to be quenched owing to the
activated vibrational deactivations and exposure to external quenchers,
thus resulting in the disappearance of RTP emission. Meanwhile, mechanical
grinding may force the molecules to stack much closer to form remarkable
π···π stackings, which afford excimer fluorescence
at a much bluer wavelength when compared to the RTP emission, thus
yielding the blue-shifted emission.

Conclusions
In summary, D–A–D-structured DTBT
with highly planar
conformations was synthesized and investigated in terms of photophysical
properties. It exhibits typical ICT characteristics with good emission
efficiency and relatively small variations in emission maxima in different
solvents, owing to its highly rigid conformations. DTBT merely generates
fluorescent emissions in solution and doped polymeric films, but generates
efficient red RTP with an impressively high Φ up to 25.0%, demonstrating CIP characteristics. Furthermore, upon
grinding, with the conversion from the ordered crystalline state to
the disordered amorphous state, red RTP (616 nm) of DTBT disappeared,
accompanying the emergence of orange excimer emission (578 nm), thus
demonstrating remarkably blue-shifted emission. Such efficient red
RTP along with mechanical-stimuli-induced blue-shifted emission is
scarcely reported. The CIP feature, outstanding red RTP emission,
and remarkable mechanochromism render DTBT highly promising for versatile
optoelectronic applications.

use. DMF as well as other commercially available reagents were directly
used. 1H (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (126 MHz) measurements
were conducted on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 MHz spectrometer using
deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent and tetramethylsilane
(δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. High-resolution

Q-Exactive mass spectrometer with an EI ion source and a UV-3600 UV–vis
photospectrometer, respectively. Emission spectra were recorded on
a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer under ambient conditions.
PL quantum yields of DTBT in solvents were evaluated by the comparison
method using quinine sulfate (Φ = 54% in 0.1
N H2SO4) as a standard, whereas those of the
single crystals and doped films were determined by the absolute method
using an integrating sphere. Single-crystal XRD data were collected
on a Bruker–Nonices Smart Apex CCD diffractometer, and refinement
was conducted using the SHELTL suite of X-ray programs (version 6.10).
The PXRD measurement was performed on an X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer.
The Gaussian 16, Revision B.01 package38 was used for geometry optimization at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.
