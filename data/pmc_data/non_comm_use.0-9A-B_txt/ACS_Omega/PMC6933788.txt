A mixed alkali-metal nonlinear optical (NLO) dihydro-cyanurate
crystal Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O has been synthesized via
the hydrothermal method. Its calculated birefringence is about 0.368,
which is very large, its ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edge is down to 230
nm, and the powder second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity is about
0.2 × KDP. In addition, a first-principles investigation of the
electronic properties on Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was
carried out. The calculated band gap and SHG coefficient values agree
well with the experimental ones. These results suggest that it could
be applied as a UV birefringent material.

1 Introduction
Birefringence is one of
the standards for the materials in which
a beam of light propagating in an anisotropic crystal splits into
two beams with different polarization directions and refractive indices.1−4 The materials with suitable birefringence have been explored continuously.5−16 Recently, numerous scientific endeavors have been made to find new
birefringent materials with good nonlinear optical (NLO) performance,17−21 and these studies suggest that the molecular construction by using
large π-conjugated anionic groups like (BO3)3–, (B3O6)3–, (NO2)−, (CO3)2–, (NO3)−, (HCOO)−,
and (C3N3O3)3– would
be a very efficient way.22−28 By exploiting these groups, a number of excellent crystals Ca3(BO3)2,29 Ba2Ca(B3O6)2,30 KSrCO3F,31 Ba2NO3(OH)3,32 K3(COOH)3[B(OH)3]2,33 Ba3(C3N3O3)2,34 etc. have been designed and synthesized.

It is well-known
that the large π-conjugated (B3O6)3– group is a source of excellent
NLO properties in materials like the famous crystal β-BaB2O4 (BBO).35,36 Owing to structural
similarity, the cyanurate group (C3N3O3)3– is a good candidate for the substation of the
(B3O6)3– group. In addition,
hydro-isocyanurate (HC3N3O3)2–, dihydro-isocyanurate (H2C3N3O3)− were synthesized via
a more easy crystal synthesis method compared to none hydrogen bonding
cyanurates.37,38 Ye’s group reported KLi(HC3N3O3)·2H2O with a large
second harmonic generation (SHG) response that was 5.3 times that
of KH2PO4 (KDP), and Lin’s group calculated
the birefringence of Cs3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O with the value
of 0.29 in ab principle plane at 514 nm.39,40 During our manuscript preparation, five compounds in the isohydro-
and dihydro-cyanurates family including the title compound have been
reported.41

In our article, the single
crystal of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was obtained by a
mild-temperature hydrothermal method in
a short synthesis period. We reported the crystal structure and measured
the powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), IR spectrum, UV–vis–NIR
spectrum, thermal analysis, SHG properties, and ab initio theoretical
calculations of the title compound.

2 Experimental and Computational Methods
2.1 Synthesis
Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was prepared via hydrothermal reaction by using RbF (1.04
g, 10 mmol), H3C3N3O3 (1.29
g, 10 mmol), and NaOH (0.40 g, 10 mmol). These reactants were transferred
into 120 mL autoclave equipped with teflon liners (5 mL of deionized
water was added) for 16 h at 190 °C, and the mixtures were cooled
slowly down to room temperature. The large quantities of crystalline
bulk crystals were obtained, and the yield of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was about 67% based on Rb.

2.2 Structure Determination
Single-crystal
XRD data were collected on a Bruker SMART APEX II CCD detector equipped
with graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å) and integrated with the SAINT.42 The crystal structure was identified with programs from SHELXTL-97.43 Final least-squares refinement on Fo2 with data having Fo2 ≥ 2σ (Fo2) includes anisotropic displacement parameters for nonhydrogen
atoms. The structure was inspected for missing symmetry elements with
PLATON.44 During the refinement process,
we found that Na(1) and Na(1B) were in positional disorder in the
structure of the compound. We restricted the sum of the ratio of Na(1)
and Na(1B) as 1 and refined them by the least-square method, which
can help to get better R values. The crystal data and structure refinement
information are summarized in Table S1.
Final atomic coordinates and equivalent isotropic displacement parameters,
selected bond lengths, and angles are listed in Tables S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information (SI), respectively.

Powder XRD was performed on a Bruker D2 PHASER X-ray diffractometer.
The 2θ range of 10–70° with a scan step width of
0.02° and a fixed counting time of 0.1 s/step. The experimental
and calculated powder XRD patterns of the compound are presented in Figure S2.

2.3 Thermal Analysis
The thermogravimetry/differential
thermal analysis (TG–DSC) curves for the Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O crystal were recorded with a NETZSCH STA 449C simultaneous
thermal analyzer. The sample was placed in an Al2O3 crucible and heated at a rate of 10 °C/min in the range
of 25–800 °C under inflowing nitrogen gas.

2.4 IR Spectrum Measurement
The IR spectra
of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was measured on a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1
spectrometer, which was mixed with dried KBr. The IR spectra were
collected in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 with
a resolution of 2 cm–1.

2.5 UV–vis–NIR Diffuse Reflectance
Measurement
The UV–vis–NIR diffuse reflectance
spectra of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O were measured using
a Shimadzu Solid Spec-3700 DUV spectrophotometer with the measurement
range extending from 200 to 1400 nm at room temperature.

2.6 Theoretical Calculation Methods
Density
functional theory based on electronic structure calculations were
carried out with the total energy mode of CASETEP package from the
Materials Studio 5.5.45 The exchange and
correlation effects were implemented via the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
functional46 with the generalized gradient
approximation (GGA).47 The relations among
the ionic cores and the valence electrons were depicted by norm-conserving
pseudopotentials.48 The valence electrons
of title compound were calculated as Rb 4s24p65s1, Na 2s22p63s1, C
2s22p2, N 2s22p3, O 2s22p4, and H 1s1. The number of plane
waves included in the basis sets was determined by the cutoff energy
of 750 eV for Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O. The numerical integration
of the Brillouin zone was performed using the Monkhorst–Pack
24 k-point grids of 3 × 3 × 3. The other
parameters and convergent criteria were the same as the default values
of the CASTEP program.

2.7 Powder Second Harmonic Generation Measurement
The SHG measurement was investigated via the Kurtz–Perry
method.49 The 1064 nm irradiation was produced
via a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser. The sample was ground and sieved into
distinct particle size ranges, <38–55, 55–88, 88–105,
105–150, and 150–200 μm. For comparisons, the
sieved KDP samples were categorized into the same particle size ranges.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Single-Crystal Structure
Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O crystallizes in non-centrosymmetric space group Pmn21 (No. 31) with unit cell parameters: a = 16.020(7) Å, b = 6.601(3) Å, c = 11.716(5) Å and Z = 2. Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O features two-dimensional layers consisting
of π-conjugated (H2C3N3O3)− 6-membered rings. The Rb atoms are eight-coordinated
to O/N atoms with two O atoms from H2O, while the Na atoms
are six-coordinated to form the NaO6 polyhedron with two
O atoms from H2O. Unfortunately, the Na atoms are split
off with the ratio of 0.843:0.157, so we mainly discussed the higher
one in the structure of the compound. Interestingly, the two polyhedra
form two-dimensional layer resembling “√mark”
along the a-axis in Figure 1a. The isolated (H2C3N3O3)− groups form a ∞2[H2C3N3O3]− layer along the b-axis in Figure 1b.
The Na+ and Rb+ cations and H2O are
filled between ∞2[H2C3N3O3]− layers with
a certain sequence along the a-axis in Figure 1c. In addition, the positions
of hydrogen bonds and water molecules in the whole structure of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O is given in Figure S1 in the SI. The bond lengths and angles for Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O are listed in the SI.

crystal structure of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O.

The experimental powder XRD pattern of the sample
is in accordance
with the theoretical one inferred from the single-crystal data (cif),
implying that the obtained phase is pure (Figure S2). In addition, the distribution of Rb, Na, C, N, and O elements
was certified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S3).

3.2 IR Spectrum
The IR spectrum of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O is shown in Figure S4 in the SI. The peaks around 2700–3500 cm–1 can confirm the presence of O–H and N–H bonds. The
absorption bands observed at 1706, 1579, and 1466 cm–1 are characteristics of the (H2C3N3O3)− group. The C–N, N–H,
and C–O bands are located at 1380, 1250, and 1074 cm–1, respectively. The peak at 883 cm–1 may be due
to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of the C3N3 groups. The bands at 786 and 692 cm–1 are
assigned to the N–C–O and and the peak at 554 cm–1 belongs to the C=O bands.50,51

3.3 UV–vis–NIR Diffuse Reflectance
Measurement
The UV–vis–IR reflectance spectra
of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O in the range of 200–1400
nm are shown in Figure 2. Evidently, its cutoff edge is down to 230 nm, with the reflectance
of 12% at 240 nm, and the energy band gap is about 4.35 eV.

3.4 Thermal Analysis
Thermal analysis
(Figure S4) indicates that Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O has two main steps of mass loss from the TG
curve. There are 10% mass losses in the first small stage in the temperature
range of 150–200 °C for the loss of three crystal water
molecules per formula unit. The second large stage in the temperature
interval between 350 and 600 °C lost mass is about 40%, which
is similar to the calculated value and can be assigned to the decomposition
of the (H2C3N3O3)− groups.52 DSC curve shows
that the smaller peaks at 184 °C and the stronger peaks at 378
°C represent the endothermic peaks of water molecules and (H2C3N3O3)− groups, respectively.

3.5 Electronic Structures
To better understand
the relationship between the structure and property, the first-principle
calculations (density functional theory) were carried out by using
the CASTEP package. Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O shows an indirect
band gap of 4.54 eV by using the GGA method (Figure 3a). The partial density of states are drawn
in Figure 3b. From Figure 3b, we can note that
valence band (VB) is mainly composed of Rb sp states, C sp states,
H s states, O sp states, and N sp states. The conduction band (CB)
mainly consists of Na sp states, C sp states O sp states, and N sp
states. The top of the VB is composed of O p states and N sp states
and the bottom of CB mainly consists of C sp states N sp states and
O sp states, which manifests that the (H2C3N3O3)− groups determine the electronic
structure and optical properties.

3.6 Linear Optical Properties
Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O has a large birefringence of 0.368 at
1064 nm (Figure 4a).
The largest reflective index is in the (0 0 1) direction and the (H2C3N3O3)− groups is in parallel to the light incident direction in the unit
cell (Figure 4b). Thus,
the largest contribution to birefringence comes from the (H2C3N3O3)− groups.
The birefringence was further investigated by using visualized total
electron density and electron localized function map (Figure 4c). It can be inferred that
(H2C3N3O3)− holds high electron densities owing to strong covalent C–N
and C–O bond. A nonspherical symmetric density distribution
is clearly presented around each N (no hydrogenation) and O atom,
which is composed of umbrella-shaped N 2s lone pairs and O nonbonding
2p electrons. Six parallel pπ electrons are uniformly
distributed at the C3N3 ring, thus corresponding
to a π-conjugated group; the π-conjugated groups produce
strong anisotropy to be conducive to birefringence. We also calculated
the bond population of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O, and
the result is presented in Table S4. It
can be found that the bond population of the H–O, C–O,
C–N, and N–H groups are in the range of 0.98–0.99,
0.6–1.06, 0.78–0.98, and 0.69–0.72, respectively.
It indicates that the H–O, C–O, C–N, and N–H
groups display strong covalent property. As is known to all, the covalent
property is beneficial for optical anisotropy and generating large
birefringence for the compounds. In conclusion, the large birefringence
of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O is mainly triggered by (H2C3N3O3)− π-conjugated groups. In addition, the phase-matching wavelength
of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was calculated (Figure 4d). It is remarkable that the
calculated type I shortest PM wavelength is about 402 nm.

3.7 NLO Properties
Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O crystallizes into a non-centrosymmetric space group (Pmn21, No. 31). The SHG intensity of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O goes up with the increasing particle size and
exhibits the final SHG intensity of about 0.2 × KDP, which indicate
that the title compound is phase matchable.

In addition, the
SHG coefficients (dij) of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O were computed to further understand the NLO
properties. The space group Pmn21 belongs
to the class mm2 point group and possesses 2 nonzero
independent SHG coefficients (d15 = −0.0675
pm/V, d33 = 0.136 pm/V) under the restriction
of Kleinman symmetry. The theoretically estimated value is in good
agreement with the experimental one in Figure S6 in the SI.

To further investigate the origin of the
SHG effects in Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O, the donation of
individual atoms in
virtual-electron (VE) transition process was computed using the SHG-density
method, and the SHG-density of VE occupied (veocc) and unoccupied
(veunocc) states are shown in Figure 5a,b, respectively. For the occupied state, O p and
N p orbitals make a significant contribution to the SHG effect. In
unoccupied states, the O p, N p, and C p orbitals make the main contribution.
These results indicate that the C–O groups and the (H2C3N3O3)− π-conjugated
groups are the main contributors for Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O with large SHG response.

orbitals of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the single
crystal of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O was obtained with
the hydrothermal method in a short synthesis
period. The calculated birefringence of Rb3Na(H2C3N3O3)4·3H2O is about 0.368, its ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edge is down
to 230 nm, the SHG intensity is about 0.2 × KDP, and phase matchable.
We believe that this work could contribute to the development of the
cyanurates and hydro-isocyanurates.
