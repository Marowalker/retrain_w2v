The increasing popularity
of “Mirto” liqueur, produced
from Myrtus communis berries, has led
to the planting of domesticated cultivars, expanding myrtle berry
production. To promote the use of cultivated berries, the content
in the nutraceutical compounds ellagitannins has been investigated
both in spontaneous and cultivated fruits. Oenothein B and eugeniflorin
D2, characterized by 1H and 13C NMR,
were isolated and quantified using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–diode
array detector–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–DAD–MS/MS).
The antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities of oenothein B were
assayed in vitro. Large amounts of oenothein B and eugeniflorin D2 were detected in seeds (12 ± 2.4 and 5.8 ± 1.2
mg/g). The oenothein B concentration in liqueurs was 194 ± 22
mg/L. This macrocyclic ellagitannin dimer showed anti-Candida (minimal inhibitory concentration <8–64 μg/mL) and
anti-inflammatory properties. Cultivated myrtle berries are a source
of nutraceutical compounds. The high concentration of oenothein B
in liqueur suggests a possible contribution to the organoleptic and
biological properties of the beverage.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Myrtus
communis L. is an evergreen
shrub or small tree growing spontaneously in the Mediterranean basin,
Madeira, and West Asia.1 In Sardinia (Italy),
myrtle berries are largely employed in the food industry, principally
by the liqueur industry to produce the popular “Mirto di Sardegna”,
recognized as a geographical indication of the island of Sardinia,
according to EC Reg. no. 110/2008. Annual production of Mirto di Sardegna
is ca. 2 million bottles. With the scope of protecting production,
given its economic importance in the Sardinian agricultural sector,
manufacturing specifications have been established since 1998 on the
basis of an in-depth study of the chemical composition of the berry
and the production process for the liqueur.2 The berries used to produce the liqueur must be gathered without
the use of pesticides or fertilizers and picked in Sardinia, and no
flavoring agents, colorants, and preservatives should be added.

The popularity of the liqueur suggested a need for agronomical
research to domesticate spontaneous plants, and the result was the
planting of about 200 ha of myrtle plants in Sardinia.3 Unfortunately, liqueur producers prefer fruit from wild
plants, which are available in sufficient quantities; therefore, the
market demand for products made with nonspontaneous plants is poor.
For this reason, there is a strong interest in seeking applications
in fields other than the liqueur industry. Better knowledge of the
nutraceutical properties of myrtle berries might represent an incentive
for their future exploitation in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic
industries.

M. communis L. berries
are rich
in phenolic compounds, including phenolic acids (gallic acid, ellagic
acid), flavonols (myricetin glycosides with small quantities of quercetin
and kaempferol glycosides), flavan-3-ols (epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin
3-O-gallate (EGCG), and epicatechin 3-O-gallate), and anthocyanins.2,4,5 The distinctive tannic and astringent taste of myrtle berry hydroalcoholic
extract cannot be explained by the limited presence of proanthocyanidins,
whose content ranges from 93 to 503 mg/L in liqueur.2

Although the phytochemical profile of myrtle berries
has previously
been described, the ellagitannin (ET) content in berries and liqueur
has been little investigated. Ellagitannins (ETs) are a complex class
of bioactive compounds, with distribution restricted to dicotyledonous
angiosperms.6 From a chemical point of
view, ETs are a complex class of hydrolysable tannins, characterized
by the presence of one or more hexahydroxydiphenoyl units, generally
esterified to a glucopyranose group. Their presence has been detected
in edible fruits of plants belonging to the orders Fagales, Rosales,
and Myrtales, such as walnut, strawberry, raspberry, pomegranate,
and myrtle (Myrtus communis L.).6,7 Consumption of food containing ETs has been associated with improved
health and reduced chronic pathologies such as inflammatory, cardiovascular,
and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer,8−10 and, thus they
are classified as potential nutraceutical ingredients.11 The biological activities of ETs are related
to two principal properties: their antioxidant potential,12 involved in the prevention and delayed development
of carcinogenesis, and their ability to participate in the complexation
of macromolecules, thus defending against inflammation and other gastrointestinal
disorders such as infections caused by microorganisms.11,13 Due to the important properties of ETs for human health described
above and to promote the use of myrtle berries, we investigated their
presence in fruits collected from both cultivated and wild plants.
We focused in particular on the chemical and biological properties
of myrtle seeds.

The aim of the first part of this study was
(i) to isolate and
structurally characterize the main ETs present in myrtle berries and
(ii) to quantify their presence in M. communis L. picked from different locations in Sardinia. We compared the
composition of domesticated cultivars and wild plants to evaluate
the possibility of promoting the nutraceutical properties of cultivated
fruits.

The aim of the second part of the study was the investigation
of
(iii) the antifungal and (iv) the anti-inflammatory properties of
oenothein B, the most abundant ET found and isolated from M. communis L. berries.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Berry Composition
Myrtle berries
are round fruits, composed of a fleshy pericarp and a snail-shaped
seed. We investigated the composition of 38 samples obtained from
both cultivated (23) and wild (15) plants to estimate the relative
mass of seeds and pericarp tissues. Seeds represented on average 22.3%
of the fruit, while the rest of the weight was represented by fleshy
tissues, as shown in Table 1. A slight difference, albeit not significant (p > 0.05), was observed in berries obtained from cultivated and
wild
plants.

2.2 Ellagic Acid and Ellagitannins from Myrtle
Seeds
Myrtle fruit is rich in secondary metabolites. The
seeds in particular have previously been reported to contain a larger
amount of phenolic compounds in comparison with other tissues in the
pericarp.4,14,15 Ellagic acid
is released after hydrolysis of ellagitannins, and its presence in
myrtle berries is well documented.14,16 We investigated
its content in seeds and found that the average amount of EA was 0.49
± 0.14 mg/g, both for wild and cultivated samples (Table 2). No significant differences
(p > 0.05) were observed between cultivated and
wild
plants.

Two main dimeric ellagitannins,
eugeniflorin D2 (1) and oenothein B (2), with a specific macrocyclic
structure were isolated from seed extracts and chemically characterized.
Eugeniflorin D2 was first isolated from Eugenia uniflora, a plant belonging to the Myrtaceae
family shown to have digestive properties.21 Oenothein B was found in Oenothera erythrosepala(18) and subsequently detected in other
species belonging to the Myrtales order. Interestingly, eugeniflorin
D2 can be converted into oenothein B when kept in aqueous
solution at 80 °C for 1 day.17 The
presence of eugeniflorin D2 and oenothein B in myrtle berries
was investigated. Chemical analysis revealed that the compounds are
accumulated in all parts of the fruit, but the amount was particularly
high in seeds (Table 2). Here, eugeniflorin D2 and oenothein B were found in
average quantities of 5.8 ± 1.2 and 12 ± 2.4 mg/g, respectively,
while in pulp and peel extract the concentrations were 1.7 ±
0.1 and 1.8 ± 0.1 mg/g, respectively (data not shown). Thus,
in M. communis L. berries, seeds represent
the main reservoir for both ellagitannins.

No significant differences
were observed in wild and cultivated
samples (p > 0.05). In myrtle, eugeniflorin D2 and oenothein B have previously been detected in leaves;19 however, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no reports relating to berries in the literature.

2.3 Oenothein B Content in Mirto di Sardegna Liqueur
We
also investigated the content of the eugeniflorin D2 and
oenothein B in Mirto di Sardegna liqueur. No traces of eugeniflorin
D2 were detected, while the average amount of oenothein
B in liqueur samples obtained from the three main Sardinian producers
was 194 ± 22 mg/L. According to our analysis of berry composition,
the estimated amount of fresh berries used (up to a maximum of approx.
180 g/L) is even higher than the legal minimum (150 g/L) prescribed
by the production protocol. Our analysis therefore contributed toward
highlighting the quality of Sardinian Mirto liqueur.

The presence
of oenothein B in liqueurs at a concentration of 124 μM, which
is well above the taste threshold concentrations for the astringent
sensation of similar taste-active ETs in aqueous solution (pH = 4.5),
in the range of 0.2–6.3 μM,20 is thought to contribute toward explaining the slightly tannic,
astringent taste of the liqueur. Moreover, recent studies have proven
that astringency is a trigeminal perception in humans and have reported
the existence of a trigeminal G protein-coupled receptor specific
for galloylated molecules.20 This study
described the dose–response curves for the activation of isolated
mouse trigeminal ganglion cells by several phenolic plant astringents,
indicating that galloyl moieties are necessary for strongly activating
substances. Oenothein B has two valoneoyl and galloyl moieties each
in its structure (Figure 4).

Finally, it has been shown that ETs can activate
human bitter taste
receptors,21 with all ETs investigated
in this library of polyphenols found to be capable of interacting
with the bitter receptor TAS2R7, with the half-maximal activation
agonist concentration (EC50) being in the range of 2.43–7.26
μM. In conclusion, oenothein B has all of the structural requirements
to be taste-active and we suggest that it could explain the liqueur’s
particular oral sensation. Further work is needed to precisely evaluate
the contribution of oenothein B to astringency and bitterness in the
specific matrix.

Oenothein B has been shown to have anticancer,
anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties.22 Due to the documented biological properties, it is reasonable to
believe that oenothein B might contribute to the beneficial effect
of berry-derived products and liqueur on human health. Seed extracts
have a positive effect on the treatment of oesophagitis-induced reflux
and colitis in rats, exhibiting anti-inflammatory properties.23 Myrtle liqueur also has vasodilatory properties,24 and extracts obtained from myrtle berries have
been shown to exert antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens
and to have an ulcer-protective effect.25,26

2.4 Oenothein B Shows Antifungal Activity against
Fluconazole-Sensitive and -Resistant Candida Strains
Oenothein B was subjected to further studies to assess its biological
properties and the possible beneficial effects deriving from the consumption
of foods containing this metabolite. Oenothein B was able to inhibit
the growth of all of the Candida strains tested,
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1), with MIC50 values ranging from
<8 to 64 μg/mL (Table 3). The inhibitory properties of the molecule against fluconazole-resistant
strains of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida glabrata are worth noting.

Figure 1 Oenothein B inhibits the growth of C. glabrata (strain RTT199_3) in a dose-dependent manner. C.
glabrata was treated with increasing concentrations
of oenothein B for 65 h. The cells were allowed to grow in dark conditions,
at 37 °C, and with continuous shaking. The growth curves were
recorded using a spectrophotometer (530 nm). The graph shows the geometric
means of three independent experiments.

a Data are geometric mean of the MIC50 values measured for
each strain in three independent experiments.

As previously reported, oenothein B is active against
the pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliense, which is the causal
agent of the most prevalent human systemic mycosis in Latin America.27 Through analysis of the transcription profile
of fungi treated with oenothein B, it has been found that the compound
exerts its antifungal activity by inhibiting the transcription of
genes like 1,3-β-glucan synthase (PbFKS1), GLN1, and KRE6, which
are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.27 The human gut is commonly colonized by Candida spp.,
but alteration of the normal gastrointestinal flora (dysbiosis), often
associated with the use of antibiotics, physical and psychological
stress, hormone intake, and dietary changes, can increase levels of Candida colonization, which is associated with several diseases
of the gastrointestinal tract, inflammation, and delays in the healing
of inflammatory lesions. Moreover, the gut is considered to be a source
for yeast dissemination and systemic candidiasis development, which
is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised
patients.28 Considering that agents able
to reduce the levels of barrier alteration and inhibit the growth
of Candida species inhabiting the gastrointestinal
tract are important for control of the dissemination and development
of candidiasis, consumption of new products obtained from myrtle berries
and containing oenothein B could exert a beneficial effect on controlling
proliferation of Candida spp. in the human gut during
episodes of dysbiosis.

2.5 Oenothein B Inhibits IL-8
Release in TNFα-
or IL-1β-Treated AGS Cells through Inhibition of NF-κB
Signaling
The stomach is one of the first sites of action
of bioactive molecules consumed with the diet, and ETs have already
shown anti-inflammatory activity at the gastric level, both in vitro
and in vivo.9,10Helicobacter pylori is the main etiological agent of gastritis. This bacterium can establish
a persistent infection in the gastric mucosa, and the local production
of chemokines represents an important step in the recruitment and
activation of inflammatory cells. The chemokine IL-8 plays a pivotal
role during H. pylori infection by
promoting neutrophil infiltration, and gastric epithelial cells are
among the main producers of this chemokine in gastric mucosa.29 IL-8 mucosal or serum levels have been positively
associated with gastric inflammation, even in the absence of H. pylori.(29,30) Furthermore, H. pylori strains, associated with peptic ulceration,
induce a higher level of IL-8 in vitro31 and increased IL-8 production has been correlated with more severe
grades of gastritis. This chemokine is regulated at the transcriptional
level by the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, and its secretion
by gastric epithelial cells is induced by H. pylori or cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β.32 To test the inhibitory activity of oenothein B on IL-8
secretion, human gastric epithelial AGS cells were treated with TNFα
(10 ng/mL) or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) in the presence of increasing
concentrations of the ellagitannin (0.25–10 μM) for 6
h.

In both conditions, the pure compound inhibited IL-8 release
in a concentration-dependent fashion (Figure 2, panels A, B), with low IC50 (0.54
and 1.29 μM for IL-8 release induced by TNFα or IL-1β,
respectively). Since IL-8 release is NF-κB-dependent, we investigated
whether oenothein B could impair the NF-κB pathway in AGS cells.
Oenothein B inhibited the NF-κB-driven transcription induced
by TNFα or IL-1β in a concentration-dependent manner,
with IC50 1.34 and 2.01 μM, respectively (Figure 3, panels A, B). To
confirm the effect of the pure compound on the NF-κB pathway,
cells were treated with TNFα or IL-1β in the presence
of increasing concentrations of oenothein B for 1 h, and the amount
of p65 in the nuclear fraction was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and normalized using the protein content. The compound
inhibited nuclear translocation induced by both cytokines with a similar
profile (IC50 1.18 and 2.72 μM, following induction
with TNFα or IL-1β, respectively), thus confirming that
inhibition of IL-8 release was due, at least in part, to impairment
of the NF-κB pathway (Figure 3, panels C, D).

Figure 2 Oenothein B inhibits IL-8 release induced
by TNF-α or IL-1β
in AGS cells. To test the effect on IL-8 secretion, AGS cells were
treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-α (panel A) or IL-1β (panel
B) in the presence of increasing concentrations of oenothein B for
6 h. The amount of released IL-8 was measured using the ELISA assay.
The graphs show the means ± standard deviation (sd) of at least
three experiments. Treatment with the reference compound (20 μM
EGCG) reduced the secretion by 70 and 36% for TNF-α and IL-1β,
respectively. Statistical analysis: one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
followed by Bonferroni as the post hoc test. *p <
0.05, ***p < 0.0001 versus stimulus alone.

Figure 3 Oenothein B inhibits NF-κB-driven transcription
and nuclear
translocation induced by TNF-α or IL-1β in AGS cells.
AGS cells were transiently transfected with the NF-κB-LUC plasmid
and then treated with increasing concentrations of oenothein B in
the presence of TNF-α (panel A) or IL-1β (panel B). Treatment
with the reference compound (20 μM EGCG) reduced transcription
by 85 and 64% for TNF-α and IL-1β, respectively. The amount
of p65 in the nuclear fraction following treatment with oenothein
B in the presence of the proinflammatory stimuli for 1 h was also
assessed (panels C and D). Treatment with the reference compound (20
μM EGCG) reduced translocation by 90 and 64% for TNF-α
and IL-1β, respectively. The graphs show the means ± sd
of at least three experiments. Statistical analysis: one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni as the post hoc test.
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.0001 versus stimulus alone.

None of the concentrations used in the assays (0.25–25 μM)
showed signs of cytotoxicity in the 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay after 6 h of treatment.

The results obtained
in our cell model clearly show that oenothein
B significantly attenuates the release of IL-8 by gastric epithelial
cells acting on the NF-κB pathway. Previous in vitro studies
have shown that ETs are fairly stable in the physiological conditions
of the stomach: gastric pH and digestive enzymes are not able to hydrolyze
or modify ETs and they are not absorbed in this area,33 suggesting possible action directly in situ. Moreover,
oenothein B showed an anti-H. pylori effect on four different strains, thus increasing the interest in
this pure ET as a potential antigastritis compound.34

This is the first time that oenothein B has been
shown to have
anti-inflammatory properties at the gastric level, supporting the
beneficial effects attributed to the consumption of food enriched
with ETs in the gastrointestinal tract.

3 Conclusions
ET-rich foods are very promising ingredients in the human diet.
Here, we have provided further evidence on the additional health effects
of native myrtle berry ETs. Myrtle berries, and the seeds in particular,
have been found to contain high amounts of the valuable ETs eugeniflorin
D2 and oenothein B, and no differences were detected between
wild and cultivated fruits. As the main ellagitannin detected, oenothein
B was subjected to further studies to assess its biological properties.
Here, we showed that it is able to inhibit the growth of several sensitive
and fluconazole-resistant Candida species inhabiting
the gastric tract, encouraging further investigations that could lead
to the discovery of broader antifungal action and thus to characterization
of a new antifungal compound. In addition, oenothein B was not only
toxic for human cell lines but also showed growth inhibition properties
against H. pylori(35) and anti-inflammatory activity in human gastric epithelial
cells, suggesting that it may represent a possible support in the
antigastritis therapy.

Taken together, our findings underline
the value of M. communis L. seeds,
without discriminating between
samples obtained from cultivated or wild sources. They are a rich
source of a valuable metabolite whose properties could be exploited
by the food and pharmaceutical industries for the development of products
useful for human health, taking advantage of the benefits derived
from ellagitannin-enriched food consumption on the intestinal tract.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Section
4.1.1 Solvents
Methanol and acetone were
of HPLC grade, acetonitrile was of LC–MS grade, and all were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Formic acid 98–100%
was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water was used for
chromatography.

4.1.2 Apparatus
For
chemical analysis,
a ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detector–tandem
mass spectrometry (UPLC–DAD–MS/MS, Waters Xevo TQ) apparatus
equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC HSST3 column (1.8 μm, 2.1 ×
100 mm2) was used. Compound isolation was performed on
a Waters HPLC equipped with a 2695 sample manager, 2996 PDA (Milford,
MA), and a Supelco Discovery HS C18 column (10 mm × 250 mm, 10
μm). NMR analysis were performed using a Bruker Avance 400 MHz
NMR spectrometer. Mass spectrometry was performed using a LTQ Orbitrap
XL Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
MA) equipped with an electrospray ion source (ESI).

4.2 Plant Material
Berries from cultivated Myrtus communis L. plants belonging to the Angela,
Maria Rita, Rosella, Maria Elisa, Erika, Uta, Comune, Piccola, LAC11,
and Michela Bianco cultivars were obtained from several farmers, while
those from wild plants were collected at several locations on the
island of Sardinia in the winters of 2008–2009, 2010–2011,
and 2013–2014, as reported in Table 1. For each sample, a stock of berries was
frozen soon after picking and kept at −20 °C till use,
while another stock was weighed to register the whole mass and then
crushed gently to manually separate the seeds from the pericarp to
determine the relative mass. The analysis was performed in triplicate.
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni as a post
hoc test was applied. Differences in p-values of
<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

4.3 Mirto di Sardegna Liqueur
The samples
of Mirto di Sardegna liqueur, collected from three producers, were
prepared in compliance with the product specifications reported in
the Decree of June 8, 2016, published in Italian Official Journal
no. 139 of June 16, 2016. In short, the production requires an infusion
of ripe, freshly collected berries, in stainless steel tanks, for
at least 15 days, with an hydroalcoholic solution (≥40% vol).
The infusion is then extracted, and demineralized water can be added
to the berries for a second extraction. The berries are then pressed
to recover the liquid. The two infusions and the press fraction are
then pooled and filtered for the preparation of the liqueur. The liqueur
is prepared by mixing the infusion with alcohol and a syrup made of
water and sugar, and optionally honey (less than 15% of the sugar).
Addition of antioxidants, colorants, preservatives, and other spirits
is not allowed. Bottling can only occur in glass containers, and the
final alcohol content is adjusted to a value between 28 and 36% vol.
The minimum quantity of berries is 150 g/L in the final liqueur.

4.4 Compound Isolation
Aliquots of berries
obtained from the M. communis L. cultivars
listed above were mixed in equal amounts, and seeds were collected
from a total of 1.2 kg of fresh berries. Seeds (ca. 270 g) were manually
separated from the pericarp, washed under tap water, and then ground
under liquid nitrogen using a laboratory mill to obtain a fine powder.
The powder was defatted with hexane and then subjected to extraction
with a solution of 70% acetone in water (1:10 w/v). The solid seed
biomass was separated from the raw extract by centrifugation for 15
min at 4000g and 5 °C, and the extraction solution
was evaporated in a rotary evaporator. The extract was suspended in
100 mL of methanol before injection in semipreparative high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Compound isolation was performed
using a Waters HPLC equipped with a 2695 sample manager, 2996 PDA
(Milford, MA), and a Supelco Discovery HS C18 column (10 mm ×
250 mm, 10 μm). Mobile phases were composed of Milli-Q water
(A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). The column temperature
was set to 50 °C, the injection volume was 100 μL, and
the flow rate was 1 mL/min. After an initial 6 min for equilibration,
the gradient conditions were as follows: 0–1 min, 0% B; 1–5
min, 0–10% B; 5–10 min, 10–25% B; 10–20
min, 25–100% B; and 20–22 min 100% B.

Fractions
containing the target compounds (retention range 2.8–3.6
min for compound 1 and 4–5.1 min for compound 2) were collected with an automatic collector based on UV
detection and the HPLC–UV chromatogram recorded at 270 nm.
Fractions containing the single compounds were combined, the solvent
was removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was suspended in
water and frozen at −20 °C. The samples were then lyophilized
and prepared for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements and
mass spectrometry analysis.

for the purified ETs were recorded in acetone-d6 and D2O (only data for D2O are reported
here) at 298 K using a 5 mm BBI probe with 90° proton pulse length
of 8.7 μs at a transmission power of 0 db and equipped with
pulsed gradient field utility. The chemical shift scale (δ)
was calibrated on the residual proton signal of deuterated acetone
at δH 2.040 and δC 29.80 and on
the residual proton signals of deuterated water at δH 4.78. The following NMR experiments were carried out: 1H NMR; decoupled 13C NMR; 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy; 1H–13C heteronuclear
single quantum coherence; and 1H–13C
heteronuclear multiple bond correlation.

For the mass spectrometry
measurement, negative ion analysis was performed in data-dependent
analysis mode. The ESI conditions in negative mode are as follows:
spray voltage, −3.5 kV; heated capillary temperature, 320 °C;
capillary voltage, −35 V; and tube lens, −110 V. In
the LTQ component of the instrument, nitrogen was used as both the
sheath gas (35 U) and auxiliary gas (5 U), and helium was used as
the damping gas. All measurements were made using the automatic gain
control of LTQ to adjust the number of ions entering the trap. Mass
calibration was performed with every sequence run just prior to starting
the batch, using the flow injection of the manufacturer’s calibration
standard mixture, allowing for mass accuracy lower than 5 ppm in external
calibration mode. Full-scan accurate mass spectra were obtained at
a mass resolution of 30 000 FWHM (m/z 400) in profile mode, while the resolving power for MS2 scans was 7500. Product ions were generated in the LTQ trap
at a collision energy of 35 eV using an isolation width of 1 Da.

4.6 Sample Preparation and Chemical Analysis
Pulp, seeds, and liqueur were subjected to chemical analysis. Samples
of pulp and seeds obtained from 10 g of fresh berries for each sample
were extracted separately with 20 mL of a solution of acetone and
water (70:30 v/v). Traces of the solvent were removed using a rotary
evaporator, and the extract was suspended in a 20 mL solution of methanol
and water (50/50) before chemical analysis. Samples of three commercial
Mirto di Sardegna liqueurs were mixed with an equal volume of a 50%
methanol solution and stored at −20 °C before chemical
analysis via ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–diode
array detection–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–DAD–MS/MS).

Extracts were analyzed according to the method described by Vrhovsek
et al.36 for the presence of ellagic acid
and oenothein B using a UPLC–DAD–MS/MS (Waters Xevo
TQ) apparatus equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC HSST3 column (1.8 μm,
2.1 × 100 mm2) and separation was carried out at 40
°C. The mobile phase was composed of eluent A (0.1% formic acid
in water) and eluent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Acetonitrile
of LC–MS grade and pure standard of ellagic acid (HPLC grade)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), while oenothein
B was isolated as reported above. Milli-Q water was used for chromatography.

The flow rate was set to 0.4 mL/min, and the gradient profile was
the following: 0 min 5% B, from 0 to 3 min linear gradient to 20%
B, 80% A; from 3 to 5 min, linear gradient to 95% B; isocratic elution
from 5 to 7 min and from 7 to 10 min and re-equilibration to the initial
conditions of 5% B. The injection volume was 2 μL for both sample
and standard solutions. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. After
each injection, the needle was rinsed with 600 μL of a weak
washing solution (water/methanol, 90:10) and 200 μL of a strong
washing solution (methanol/water, 90:10). Samples were kept at 6 °C
during the analysis. The DAD spectrum was recorded between 200 and
600 nm. Mass spectrometry detection was performed on a Waters Xevo
TQMS (Milford, MA) instrument equipped with an electrospray (ESI)
source. Capillary voltage was 3.5 kV in positive mode and −2.5
kV in negative mode; the source was kept at 150 °C; the desolvation
temperature was 500 °C; the cone gas flow was 50 L/h; and the
desolvation gas flow was 800 L/h.

Each metabolite was directly
infused in the MS system in negative
mode with 50:50 v/v of two mobile phases A and B to optimize the detection
process. The two most abundant fragments were selected for each metabolite,
one as a quantifier (most abundant) and the other as a qualifier ion
using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for selective
quantification. The MRM conditions were optimized automatically by
Waters Intellistart software. MRM transitions for ellagic acid, eugeniflorin
D2, and oenothein B are reported in Table 4.

For the quantification, linear calibration curves
were obtained
by the injection of 10 dilutions of the stock solution in a concentration
range of 0.178–670 mg/L for oenothein B and 0.130–208
mg/L for eugeniflorin D2. The calibration curve of ellagic
acid was obtained by the injection of eight dilutions of the stock
solution in a concentration range of 0.056–180 mg/L. All standard
solutions were prepared in water. Data processing, calibration curve
calculation, and quantification were carried out by Waters TargetLynx
software. All curves showed good linearity over the concentration
range. The limit of detection (LOD) for onothein B was 0.059 mg/L,
and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.244 mg/L. For eugeniflorin
D2, the LOD was calculated to be 0.064 mg/L and the LOQ
was 0.190 mg/L, while for ellagic acid, the LOD was 0.028 mg/L and
the LOQ was 0.095 mg/L.

4.7 Antifungal Susceptibility
Assay
For
antifungal susceptibility testing, clinical strains isolated from
human gut C. albicans MFB005FS3, C. albicans MFB008MM1, C. albicans YMS 102_2, C. parapsilosis MFB005FS5, C. glabrata MFB004, C. glabrata MFB005FS4, C. glabrata RTT99_3, and C. tropicalis RTT037-337 were tested for their susceptibility to oenothein B.

Yeasts
were grown on Sabouraud agar medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
for 48 h at 30 °C and resuspended in distilled water at a concentration
of (1–5) × 105 CFU/mL before testing.

Yeasts were tested for their susceptibility to oenothein B (five
dilution series, ranging from 125 to 8 μg/mL) following the
European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing protocol.38 Briefly, cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium
supplied with 2.0% glucose, counted, and inoculated at a concentration
of (1–5) × 105 CFU/mL. Minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) values were determined using a spectrophotometer (at 530 nm)
after 48 and 120 h of incubation as the lowest concentration of the
drug that resulted in a ≥50% inhibition of growth relative
to the growth control.

Growth curves for oenothein-treated and
untreated Candida spp. were recorded using a spectrophotometer
(at 530 nm). Inoculated
plates were kept in the dark at 37 °C, with gentle agitation,
and the cell density values were measured every 30 min for over 65
h.

4.8 Anti-inflammatory Assay
Human adenocarcinoma
epithelial gastric cells (AGS, CRL-1739, LGC Standard S.r.l., Milan,
Italy) were grown at 37 °C in DMEM F12 (Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented
with 100 U penicillin/mL, 100 mg of streptomycin/mL, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Euroclone
S.p.A, Pero, Italy) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. During treatments with oenothein B or vehicle alone (<0.1%
dimethyl sulfoxide), cells were placed in a medium deprived of FCS.

To test IL-8 release, AGS cells were grown in 24-well plates (30 000
cells/well) for 48 h; then, cells were treated with the proinflammatory
stimuli TNFα or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) in the presence of oenothein
B. IL-8 release reached its maximum at 6 h, and this time was selected
for experiments to test the effect of the individual compound (0.25–10
μM). After 6 h, the medium was collected and stored at −20
°C until IL-8 quantification with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), as previously described.17 These assays were performed in duplicate, and
at least three experiments were performed.

To evaluate the effect
on NF-κB-driven transcription, cells
were plated in 24-well plates (30 000 cells/well). After 48
h, cells were transiently transfected using the calcium-phosphate
method with the reporter plasmids NF-κB-LUC (50 ng/well), which
contain the luciferase gene, under the control of three κB-responsive
elements. The plasmid was a gift from Dr. N. Marx (Department of Internal
medicine, Cardiology, University of Ulm, Germany). After 16 h, cells
were stimulated with TNFα or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) and pure
ellagitannin was tested at 0.5–25 μM. After 6 h, cells
were lysed and luciferase assay was performed using BritelitePlus
reagent (PerkinElmer Inc., Massachusetts), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions; the signal was read with VictorX3 (PerkinElmer, Walthman
MA). Data were expressed considering 100% of luciferase activity related
to cytokine-induced NF-κB-driven transcription. These assays
were performed in triplicate within each experiment, and at least
three experiments were performed.

To assess the effects of oenothein
B on NF-κB (p65) nuclear
translocation, AGS cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/mL in 100 mm plates. After 48 h, cells were treated
for 1 h with TNFα or IL-1β (10 ng/mL) and oenothein B
(1–10 μM). Nuclear extracts were prepared using the nuclear
extraction kit from the Cayman Chemical Company (Michigan), and stored
at −80 °C until assay. The same amount of total nuclear
proteins (10 μg/well), measured according to the Bradford (Bio-Rad)
assay, was used to assess NF-κB nuclear translocation using
the NF-κB (p65) transcription factor assay kit (Cayman) followed
by spectroscopy at 450 nm, 0.1 s (VictorX3, PerkinElmer, Walthman
MA). Data were expressed considering 100% of absorbance related to
cytokine-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation. These assays were
performed in duplicate within each experiment. At least three experiments
were performed. Epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCG)
20 μM was used as the reference compound for each inflammation-related
test.

4.9 Cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicity of
oenothein B was evaluated with the 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2-5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, as previously described.39
