Potential-dependent
CO2 electroreduction pathways on
Cu(111) are systematically studied with the aim of applying an improved
electrode/aqueous interface model in this paper. The results indicate
that our present defined CH2O and CHOH pathways may be
able to parallelly take place at low overpotentials. Notably, the
applied potentials will not alter the optimal CO2 reduction
mechanisms. However, the presence of high overpotentials makes CO2 electroreduction more favorable, thus explaining why high
overpotentials at experiments are required during CO2 electroreduction
on Cu. Based on the potential-dependent energetics, the results suggest
that COOH and CHO intermediates may be unstable at low overpotentials,
in which COOH can easily change back to CO2 and CHO can
easily change back to CO, thus preventing CO2 electroreduction.
However, the high overpotentials will facilitate the formation and
further electroreduction of CO and CHO. Thus, we can speculate that
CO formation and then further electroreduction into CHO are the possible
potential-limiting steps during CO2 electroreduction, which
are regarded as the origin of experimentally observed high overpotentials.
The present comprehensive understanding on CO2 electroreduction
pathways can provide theoretical guidelines for efficiently designing
Cu-based alloy electrocatalysts operated under the conditions of low
overpotentials.

Introduction
Cu is the only monometallic
electrocatalyst that can electrochemically
reduce CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals with reasonable
current density, such as hydrocarbons CH4 and C2H4.1−3 The selectivity of hydrocarbon products had been
revealed on Cu electrodes by early experiments, which is crystal face-dependent.4−8 Especially, CH4 is more facile to form on the close-packed
Cu(111) surface because of its greater selectivity to C1 species than the more open (100) crystal face of Cu. However, the
practical application of CO2 electroreduction on the Cu
electrodes is hindered because of required high overpotentials (ca.
1 V vs RHE).5 Furthermore, complexities
of the electrochemical environment make electroreduction mechanisms
of CO2 remain elusive.6−13 Therefore, comprehensive understanding on CO2 electroreduction
pathways and rate-limiting steps will help rationally design Cu-based
alloy electrocatalysts.

Although some spectroscopy techniques
had provided some important
insights into the nature of adsorbed species during CH4 production, such as CO2, CO, and HCOO– and speculated that intermediate CH2 is a precursor at
the electrode/aqueous interface,14−16 experimental understanding
of the CO2 electroreduction mechanism has been challenged
and impeded for lack of in situ spectral characterization technologies.
On the basis of previous electrokinetic experiments, thus, only very
limited mechanistic insights into CO2 electroreduction
can be concluded. At present, to obtain various crucial electrocatalytic
reaction mechanisms, theoretical calculations have become a unique
tool.17,18 The favored intermediates that are not accessible
at experiments for product formations can be identified by the calculated
results and thus mechanistic insight can be offered. Unfortunately,
complete understanding on the major electroreduction pathways of CO2 on Cu(111) that result in product CH4 is still
not achieved and disagreements still exist because of complexity of
electrode/aqueous interfaces despite numerous theoretical efforts
based on the various theoretical methodologies, especially the determination
of key intermediates, such as CHO, COH, CH2O, CHOH and
so forth.19−32 Thus, the simulation of an electrochemical interface is still a
subject of ongoing discussion, in which the early experimental results
need be employed to examine and confirm whether the proposed computational
methods for describing the electrochemical interface are accurate
enough and identify the lacking intermediate in the indeterminacy
of the electrocatalytic reaction pathways.

In this paper, an
improved electrode/aqueous interface model based
on a model of CO coverage with two explicit relaxed H2O
bilayers is used to study CO2 electroreduction pathways,
in which the formation of CH4 production of Cu(111) surface
is taken as an example as the (111) facet of Cu exhibits a high selectivity
for CH4. In fact, the previous study conducted by Nørskov
et al. had showed that using of a model of two relaxed H2O bilayers can rationally model the interactions between solvent
and adsorbates and determine the kinetic barriers by calculating the
capacitance across the double electric layer.33 Furthermore, our most recent study has elaborated the interactions
between the present used solvation model and adsorbents.34,35 As a part of our effort, the onset potentials and potential-dependent
energetics for each elementary step are calculated at electrode/aqueous
interfaces based on the previous theoretical models. The excellent
consistencies between the present calculated results and available
experimental data and partial theoretical calculations confirm the
validity of the present used model and method.

Results and Discussion
CO Coverage-Dependent
Equilibrium Potentials
The relationship
between CO coverage and equilibrium potentials has been given in our
most recent study.36 As can be seen in Figure 1a, the reasonable
linear relationship is exhibited on Cu(111) between the differential
adsorption energy of CO, ΔE(θ), and CO
coverage (θCO), suggesting that CO adsorption may
approximately follow the Termkin adsorption isotherms on Cu(111).
We can calculate ΔE(θ) at any θCO through linearly fitting the ΔE(θ)
≈ θCO data to a straight line. Thus, the linear
relationships between the calculated equilibrium potentials (U) and CO coverage (θCO) on Cu(111) can
be obtained based on eq 4, as shown in Figure 1b. It can be observed that more CO coverage will result in more negative
equilibrium potential for CO2 electroreduction on the Cu
surface, implying that the overpotential may derive from the adsorbed
CO. The thermodynamic equilibrium potential is calculated as ca. 0.27
V (vs RHE) when θCO is close to zero, which is comparable
with the previous proposed thermodynamic equilibrium potential of
0.17 V for CO2 electroreduction, partially confirming the
reasonability of the present used computational model.25 In our present investigation, CO2 electroreduction pathways on Cu(111) will be first focused at the
low CO coverage of 1/9 ML for comparison, which corresponds to the
calculated equilibrium potential of ca. 0.14 V and the conditions
of low overpotentials. Considering the expensive computational cost,
further analysis will be carried out at more negative applied potentials
based on the approach from Nørskov et al. and Asthagiri et al.
to determine the effect of applied potentials on kinetic barriers
and reaction free energies (see Computational Details).24−26,29

CO2 Electroreduction Pathways
at Low Overpotential
Although CO2 reduction mechanisms
at low overpotential
have been given in our most recent work,36 they are still elucidated in this paper for comparison. Thereinto,
CO2 electrochemical reduction pathways are simulated via
direct transfer of surface adsorbed H atoms to adsorbed species and
the previous proposed H-shuttling mode forming acid hydronium ion
is not considered as electrocatalytic CO2 reduction generally
occurs in nonacidic conditions.1−5,10,37 As shown in Figure S1, formation of the
intermediate trans-COOH is more favorable in the
first elementary reaction step through direct hydrogenation of physical
adsorbed CO2 as relatively lower activation barrier of
ca. 0.87 eV is required than cis-COOH formation (ca.
1.20 eV). The subsequent hydrogenative dissociation of trans-COOH can produce the key intermediate CO along with H2O formation with a low and surmountable barrier of ca. 0.20 eV at
room temperature. The minimum energy pathways (MEPs) analysis is also
performed for CO2 hydrogenative dissociation into CO in
order to further validate the possibility of the trans-COOH formation. For this pathway, an almost identical barrier of
ca. 0.87 eV is obtained with trans-COOH formation,
implying that trans-COOH is a key intermediate during
initial CO2 electroreduction into CO. The COOH species
was also speculated to be a possible intermediate in the previous
theoretical studies involving various solvation models.29,30,32,38 Furthermore, our calculated barriers using the present electrode/aqueous
interface model exhibit excellent consistencies compared with the
earlier report form Asthagiri et al. for the first elementary step
during CO2 electroreduction.32

For production of hydrocarbons CH4, further electroreduction
of CO is one of the crucial steps. The direct hydrogenation of CO
can lead to the formation of intermediates CHO and COH on Cu(111)
and the barriers are calculated as 0.85 and 1.39 eV, respectively,
as can be seen in Figure S2, showing that
CHO formation is more facile to occur at low overpotential. The present
conclusions are coincident with earlier studies from Nørskov
et al. based on density functional theory (DFT) calculation where
CHO can be more easily formed than COH on Cu(111).25−27 However, the
disagreeable result was also obtained by others previous theoretical
reports,29,30,32 namely, COH
formation is more favorable via the proton–electron transfer
reaction at an applied potential of ca. −0.60 V (vs RHE) because
of the shorter path between the hydrated proton and the O atom of
CO, finally resulting in CH4 formation through sequential
electroreduction. By applying a similar potential and an identical
solvation model on Cu(111) with our present paper, in fact, our most
recent study also showed that the barrier of CHO formation via proton–electron
transfer is notably lower than COH formation (ca. 0.98 vs 1.83 eV).39 The preferred CO adsorption configuration that
adsorbed via C atoms may be able to explain why CHO pathways are more
favorable on Cu(111), in which the direct electronic donation from
the Cu surface to adsorbed CO can lead to more localized electrons
on the C atom. Thus, the surface-adsorbed H atom or solvated proton
tends to reach the C atom of CO to form CHO. Our present result for
CO electroreduction into CHO exhibits excellent inconsistencies compared
with the most recent experimental report from Koper et al. for CO2 electroreduction into CH4 on Cu(111).8,13 The difference of the solvation model may lead to the disagreements
between earlier theoretical and our present studies. Only a single
H2O molecule and fixed H2O bilayer model were
employed in earlier studies, which are inadequate to capture and describe
the solvent effect.

Further hydrogenation of CHO may be able
to produce intermediates
CH2O and CHOH. The almost identical barriers of ca. 0.45
eV suggest that further electroreduction of CHO into CH2O and CHOH both are favorable at low overpotential and facile to
take place because of surmountable barriers at room temperature, as
shown in Figure S3. Further electroreduction
of CH2O may be able to form CH2OH and CH3O and the calculated barriers are 0.32 and 0.23 eV, respectively.
This extremely low value and subtle difference make the formations
of these both intermediates favorable (see Figure S4). CHOH hydrogenation is also able to form CH2OH and a low barrier of ca. 0.38 eV is required (see Figure S5). Simultaneously, a possible pathway
is proposed, namely, CHOH hydrogenative dissociation into intermediate
CH along with H2O formation, which is almost a nonactivated
process with the barrier of only ca. 0.19 eV, suggesting that CH species
is also favorable on Cu(111) and it opens a pathway via CHO species
that can lead to CH4 production. However, the previous
DFT studies conducted by Asthagiri et al. showed that CHO only can
lead to CH3OH production because of a notably high barrier
for CHOH reduction into CH, whereas COH leads to CH4 production.12,29,32 The abovementioned difference
of the solvation model can be also used to explain the inconsistencies
between earlier and present theoretical studies. Our calculated barriers
are comparable with some previous reported theoretical values at electrochemical
interfaces,29,37,40 validating the rationality of our present employed electrode/aqueous
interface model to some degree.

There may be three possibilities
for further CH2OH electroreduction,
including direct hydrogenation into CH3OH, hydrogenative
dissociation along with H2O formation, and direct dissociation
into CH2 through cleavage of the C–O bond. The results
indicate that CH2OH reduction inclines to produce CH2 along with H2O formation because of an extremely
low barrier of ca. 0.07 eV (see Figure S6). CH3OH formation kinetically may be prohibited because
of relatively higher barriers for further CH2OH and CH3O electroreduction (see Figures S6 and S7). The present barriers for CH2OH electroreduction
into CH3OH and CH2 along with H2O
formation by surface hydrogenation are comparable with those of corresponding
processes through proton–electron transfer reaction from Skúlason
et al.,30 in which surface-adsorbed H atoms
are first formed by the electron-coupled proton transfer via a Volmer
reaction and then hydrogenation of the surface-adsorbed intermediates
results in formation of the corresponding species. The agreement of
barriers may be able to confirm the validity of our present employed
direct transfer model of surface-adsorbed H atoms. Further CH hydrogenation
is also able to form CH2 species with a surmountable barrier
of ca. 0.33 eV at room temperature. Subsequently, CH4 can
be produced by CH2 sequential hydrogenation. The considerably
higher barrier of ca. 1.31 eV for CH4 formation may be
able to be attributed to the observed physisorption state of CH4 on Cu(111) (see Figure S8). The
calculated barriers are also comparable with the earlier report from
Asthagiri et al.29 On the basis of the
energies in Table S1, two possible mechanisms,
namely, CH2O and CHOH pathways, can be defined for CO2 electroreduction. As can be seen in Figure 2, the identical barrier of ca. 0.87 eV is
observed for these two possible mechanisms by comprehensively considering
on the overall energy profiles, suggesting that CH2O and
CHOH pathways through common intermediates CHO and CH2 may
be able to parallelly take place on Cu(111) at a low overpotential.
CH3OH formation is also thermodynamically less favorable
as CO2 electroreduction into CH4 is a stronger
exothermic process. Thus, the present study explains why only CH4 is experimentally observed on the Cu electrodes at electrochemical
interfaces, rather than CH3OH.5,41 Although
CH3 final electroreduction into CH4 has a significantly
higher barrier than others’ steps, the strongly exothermic
process during CH2 sequential electroreduction makes production
of CH4 easily occur.

Figure 2 Overall energy profiles of CO2 electroreduction into
products CH4 and CH3OH on Cu(111) at low overpotentials:
(a) CH2O pathway; (b) CHOH pathway.

By scrutinizing the overall energy profiles, we find that the barrier
height of overall energy profiles can be determined by initial CO2 electroreduction into the COOH pathway. Moreover, intermediate
COOH further electroreduction into CO and the inverse process of COOH
formation and may be competitive due to almost equal and surmountable
barriers of ca. 0.20 eV at room temperature, which will inhibit key
intermediate CO formation. Simultaneously, it is also noted that the
inverse process of CO electroreduction into CHO only needs an extremely
low barrier of ca. 0.20 eV, suggesting that CHO may be not stable
at low overpotentials, which can be facile to change back to CO. Thus,
we can speculate that CO formation and further reduction may be the
potential-limiting steps during CO2 electroreduction, which
are regarded as the origin of an experimentally observed high overpotential
on the Cu surfaces. In following sections, on the basis of the energetics
obtained at low overpotentials by the currently used electrochemical
model, the onset potential and potential-dependent kinetic barriers
and reaction free energies for each elementary step will be considered
to further determine the origin of the overpotential, the potential-limiting
step, and the effect of the applied potentials on CO2 electroreduction
pathways on Cu(111) using the approaches from Asthagiri et al. and
Nørskov et al.

Determination of the Onset Potential
The onset potential
(Uonset) is relative with our DFT-calculated
kinetic barriers, namely, the lower barrier and faster reaction rate
means more positive onset potential for CO2 electroreduction
on Cu(111). Thus, to further ascertain the optimal CO2 electroreduction
pathways and the potential-limiting step at the present used electrochemical
interface, the onset potentials are determined for each elementary
step during CO2 electroreduction based on eq 8 based on the energetics obtained
at low overpotentials by the present improved CO coverage-dependent
electrochemical model, in which the value of equilibrium potential
(U0) can be calculated by eq 7, as can be seen in Table 1. A surmountable barrier of
0.40 eV is assumed to be the threshold, which will make a specific
pathway open up at room temperature and give significant reduction
rates. For CO2 electroreduction into key intermediate CO
on Cu(111), adsorbed COOH is found to be an intermediate, which then
is electroreduced into adsorbed CO and a H2O molecule.
A negative onset potential of −0.69 V (vs RHE) is required
for CO2 electroreduction into COOH, whereas a positive
onset potential of 0.59 V (vs RHE) is required to overcome the assumed
kinetic barrier for CO formation through the COOH intermediate, suggesting
that CO2 electroreduction into COOH is the potential-limiting
step during CO2 electroreduction into CO on Cu(111), as
observed above for a higher kinetic barrier (ca. 0.87 eV). The present
calculated onset potential for CO2 electroreduction into
COOH is also well agreeable with that of the corresponding process
on Cu(111) from Asthagiri et al. (ca. −0.64 eV vs RHE),32 further indicating that the validity of our
present used an electrochemical model. There are two ways for further
electroreduction of CO, including CHO or COH formation by CO hydrogenation.
A significantly more negative onset potential of −1.87 V (vs
RHE) is required for COH formation than that of CHO formation (−0.79
V vs RHE). The results show CHO can be more facile to be formed on
Cu(111), which is consistent with the above MEP analysis on Cu(111),
namely, CO electroreduction into CHO is kinetically more favorable
than electroreduction into COH.

Further electroreduction of CHO into CH2O and CHOH has
a slightly positive and almost identical onset potential, ca. 0.05
V (vs RHE), suggesting that CH2O and CHOH formations may
be able to simultaneously occur on Cu(111). A similar conclusion is
also obtained by the above MEP analysis. Thus, further electroreduction
of CH2O and CHOH is considered. It is found that CH2OH formation requires positive and almost identical onset
potential through CH2O and CHOH electroreduction, ca. 0.30
V (vs RHE), suggesting that CH2OH may be able to be formed
by CH2O and CHOH electroreduction. Simultaneously, the
more positive onset potentials of 0.48 and 0.63 V (vs RHE) are required
for CH2O further electroreduction into CH3O
and CHOH further electroreduction CH and H2O, respectively.
Thus, these results show that CH2OH, CH3O, and
CH may be able to be easily formed at this stage, which can be confirmed
by the above obtained extremely low barriers for these electroreduction
steps. CH3OH may be able to be formed by further electroreduction
of CH2OH and CH3O, in which the required onset
potentials are 0.22 and −0.52 eV (vs RHE), respectively. Thus,
CH3OH seems to be able to be produced by CH2OH electroreduction because of considerably negative onset potential
for CH3O electroreduction during CO2 electroreduction
into hydrocarbons. A similar conclusion is also given by the above
calculated barriers. However, a significantly more positive onset
potential of 0.80 V (vs RHE) is required for further electroreduction
of CH2OH to CH2 and H2O, thereby
suggesting that CH2OH electroreduction into CH2 is favored over CH3OH on Cu(111) at the electrochemical
interface. An identical conclusion is also obtained by the above MEP
analysis. Simultaneously, CH2 is also able to be formed
by further electroreduction of CH with a positive onset potential
of 0.15 V (vs RHE) and a surmountable barrier at room temperature
(ca. 0.33 V). Finally, CH4 can be produced by serial electroreduction
of CH2 with a strongly exothermic process.

The investigations
on onset potentials again explain why experimentally
only CH4 can be observed on the Cu electrodes at electrochemical
interface. Combining MEP analysis with the calculated onset potentials,
it can be speculated that CO formation and then further electroreduction
into CHO may be the potential-limiting step during CO2 electroreduction
into hydrocarbons because of significantly more negative onset potentials
than others, which again confirms that this step is the origin of
experimentally observed high overpotential on the Cu electrodes. Accordingly,
the optimal CO2 electroreduction mechanism on Cu(111) can
be presented at the present used electrode/aqueous interface by comprehensive
consideration of the MEP and onset potentials, which is in complete
agreement with the optimal electroreduction pathways of CO2 obtained at low overpotentials in our most recent study,36 as shown in Figure 3. In spite of being CH2O or CHOH
pathways, the present results all show that CO2 electroreduction
into CH4 on Cu(111) mainly proceeds by the common intermediates
CHO and CH2 species, which are found to be well consistent
with the available experimental data. For instance, the most recent
experimental study conducted by Koper et al. indicated that CHO is
the possibly crucial intermediate toward CH2 formation
on Cu(111) using online electrochemical mass spectrometry;8,13 the study from Dewulf et al. also indicated that adsorbed CHO and
CH2 species are key intermediates for CO2 electroreduction
into CH4 production on the Cu electrodes using the in situ
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and auger electron spectroscopy.16 Thus, the rationality of the present employed
electrochemical model can be further validated.

by comprehensive consideration of the MEP and onset potentials: (a)
CH2O pathway; (b) CHOH pathway.36

Potential-Dependent Activation
Barriers and Reaction Free Energies
To further determine
the effect of applied potentials on CO2 electroreduction
pathways on Cu(111), the potential-dependent
activation barriers and reaction free energies are calculated by eqs 5 and 7, respectively, in which Eact0(U0) is the
activation barrier of each elementary step at equilibrium potential
(U0) and can be directly determined by
DFT calculations. Three representative conditions are considered,
namely, the present calculated thermodynamic equilibrium potential
of ca. 0.27 V (vs RHE) when θCO is close to zero,
low overpotential (0.14 and 0 V vs RHE), and high overpotential (−0.8
and −0.9 V vs RHE), in which the applied potential of 0.14
V (vs RHE) corresponds to our above-simulated electrochemical interface.
The comparison of energetics at 0.14 V (vs RHE) between the present
theoretical model and previous methodologies from Asthagiri et al.
and Nørskov et al. may be able to confirm the validity of our
used model. The calculated potential-dependent activation barriers
and reaction free energies are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
It is found that the activation barriers and reaction free energies
linearly change as the applied potentials. The observed activation
barriers and reaction free energies of various elementary steps at
equilibrium potential of ca. 0.27 V (vs RHE) are more positive than
those at more negative applied potentials. Especially at high overpotentials,
the kinetic barriers are significantly decreased and the reactions
are all almost strongly exothermic. Furthermore, the barriers are
surmountable at room temperature except the CH4 formation
step when the applied potential reaches −0.8 V (vs RHE) based
on the kinetic calculations. Although a high barrier of ca. 0.80 eV
is required for CH4 formation even if the potential is
−0.9 V (vs RHE), the strongly exothermic processes for CH2 serial hydrogenation (ca. 4.00 eV) at high overpotential
still make its formation occur easily. Simultaneously, we also note
that the kinetic barriers of some elementary steps are close to 0
eV at relatively lower overpotentials during CO2 electroreduction
into CH4 on Cu(111). For example, the barrier of 0 eV is
reached for COOH hydrogenative dissociation into CO at −0.21
V, CHO hydrogenation into CH2O and CHOH at ca. −0.75
V (vs RHE), CH2O hydrogenation into CH2OH and
its hydrogenative dissociation into CH2 at 0 V (vs RHE),
CH2O hydrogenation into CH3O at −0.32
V (vs RHE), CHOH hydrogenation into CH2OH, and its hydrogenation
into CH3OH at ca. −0.56 V (vs RHE), CHOH hydrogenation
into CH at −0.17 V, CH hydrogenation into CH2 at
−0.65 V (vs RHE), and its hydrogenation into CH3 at 0 V (vs RHE), suggesting that these steps may be nonactivated
processes at the applied potentials of higher than −0.8 V (vs
RHE). Further electroreduction of CO into CHO and COH is scrutinized
at different applied potentials. Even at high applied potential of
−0.9 V (vs RHE), COH formation still has a notably higher barrier
of ca. 0.90 eV than CHO formation and positive reaction free energy
of ca. 0.10 eV, showing that CO electroreduction into CHO is also
kinetically more favorable at high overpotentials.

As
noted above, CO formation and then further electroreduction
into CHO may be the potential-limiting step during CO2 electroreduction
into CH4 on Cu(111) at a low overpotential (ca. 0.14 V
vs RHE) with high kinetic barrier of ca. 0.86 eV. On the basis of
the potential-dependent barrier calculations, the formation of CO
and its further electroreduction into CHO may be able to occur more
and more facilely as increasing overpotential, as shown in Figure 4. The kinetic barriers
of CO2 electroreduction into COOH and CO further electroreduction
will be reduced to ca. 0.40 eV when the applied potential reaches
−0.8 V (vs RHE), which can be overcome at room temperature.
The corresponding barriers will be further lowered to 0.30 and 0.35
eV at the applied potential of −0.9 V (vs RHE), respectively.
Interestingly, we also note that the barrier linearly increases with
increasing overpotentials for the reverse processes of these both
potential-limiting steps (see Figure 4), which can be obtained by Eact(U) – ΔGreac(U). The equal barrier for forward and
reverse processes of CO2 electroreduction into COOH and
CO electroreduction into CHO may be able to be reached at the applied
potential of ca. −0.38 and −0.54 V (vs RHE), respectively.
As can be seen in Figure 4, at thermodynamic equilibrium potential and low overpotentials,
the considerably high kinetic barriers for CO2 electroreduction
into COOH and CO electroreduction into CHO is required, whereas their
reverse process is almost nonactivated because of extremely low barriers
(ca. 0.20 eV). The results suggest that COOH and CHO intermediates
may be unstable at the present calculated thermodynamic equilibrium
potential and low overpotentials, in which COOH can easily change
back to CO2 through O–H bond cleavage and is competitive
with further electroreduction of COOH, and CHO can easily change back
to CO through C–H bond breaking and is competitive with further
electroreduction of CHO, thus leading to not easy formations of some
key intermediates and preventing CO2 electroreduction on
the Cu electrodes. However, the barriers are lowered to surmountable
values at room temperature at high overpotentials for CO2 electroreduction into COOH and CO electroreduction into CHO, whereas
they are notably increased for the corresponding reverse processes,
which can facilitate CO and CHO formations and further electroreduction.
Thus, the present analyses of potential-limiting steps may be able
to explain partially why the high overpotential (ca. 1 V vs RHE) is
required for CO2 electroreduction into CH4 in
at experiments on the Cu electrodes.4,5

Figure 4 Relationships between
the applied electrode potentials and activation
barriers of forward and reverse processes for (a) CO2 electroreduction
into COOH and (b) CO electroreduction into CHO on Cu(111).

Simultaneously, we observe that the calculated potential-dependent
barriers and reaction free energies of each elementary step at low
overpotentials based on the methodologies from Asthagiri et al. and
Nørskov et al. are almost identical with the corresponding values
(Eact0(U0) and ΔGreac(U0)) obtained by our
present simulated conditions of low overpotential, as can be seen
in Tables 2 and 3, further confirming the rationality of our used
electrochemical interface. For comparison, the overall energy profiles
of CO2 electroreduction into CH4 and CH3OH on Cu(111) at high overpotential are also given, as shown
in Figure 5. We find
that the optimal CO2 electroreduction mechanisms are not
altered at high overpotentials compared with that of low overpotentials,
namely, CH2O and CHOH pathways through common intermediates
CHO and CH2 are still able to occur simultaneously, suggesting
that CO2 electroreduction pathways on the Cu electrodes
may be not affected by the applied potentials. It is also observed
that CO2 electroreduction into CH4 is a more
strongly exothermic process than into CH3OH at high overpotentials
(−8.80 vs −6.22 eV), again confirming that CH4 formation is thermodynamically more favorable than CH3OH and explaining why only CH4 is observed experimentally
on the Cu surface at the electrochemical interface. It is noteworthy
that the kinetic barrier of ca. 0.35 eV for the overall energy pathway
is observed at high overpotentials (see Figure 5), which is significantly lower than that
of low overpotentials (ca. 0.87 eV). Moreover, CO2 electroreduction
into CH4 is also significantly stronger exothermically
at high overpotentials than that of low overpotentials (−8.80
vs −2.47 eV). Thus, CO2 electroreduction into CH4 is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable at high
overpotentials, on the whole explaining why the high overpotentials
are required during CO2 electroreduction at experiments
on the Cu electrodes.

CH4 and CH3OH on Cu(111) at the applied potential
of −0.8 V (vs RHE): (a) CH2O pathway; (b) CHOH pathway

in the overall energy profiles).

Conclusions
In this paper, potential-dependent CO2 electroreduction
pathways on Cu(111) are systematically studied with the aim of applying
an improved electrode/aqueous interface model. The results indicate
that the present defined CH2O and CHOH pathways may be
able to parallelly take place at low overpotentials, which proceed
via common intermediate CHO and CH2 species. Notably, the
applied potentials will not alter the optimal CO2 electroreduction
mechanisms. However, the presence of high overpotentials makes CO2 electroreduction more favorable because of the significantly
reduced kinetic barriers of overall energy pathway and various elementary
steps, thus explaining why the high overpotential at experiments is
required during CO2 electroreduction on the Cu electrodes.
On the basis of the analyses of potential-dependent energetics, the
results suggest that COOH and CHO intermediates may be unstable at
low overpotentials, in which COOH can easily change back to CO2 and CHO can easily change back to CO, thus preventing CO2 electroreduction. However, the high overpotentials can significantly
reduce the barriers for CO2 electroreduction into COOH
and CO electroreduction into CHO and notably increase the barriers
for the corresponding inverse processes, facilitating CO and CHO formations
and further electroreduction. Thus, we can speculate that CO formation
and then further electroreduction into CHO may be the potential-limiting
steps of CO2 electroreduction, which are regarded as the
origin of experimentally observed high overpotentials. The present
comprehensive understanding on CO2 electroreduction pathways
can provide theoretical guidelines for efficiently designing Cu-based
alloy electrocatalysts operated under the conditions of low overpotentials.

Computational
Details
Determination of CO Coverage-Dependent Equilibrium Potentials
Surface and solvation model and computational parameters are demonstrated
in the Supporting Information in detail.
The method for determining CO coverage-dependent equilibrium potentials
had been reported in our most recent study,36 which was first employed to model electroreduction pathways of CO2 at low overpotentials. For clarity, the corresponding method
is again elaborated in this paper. The CO intermediate is formed during
CO2 electroreduction by the following reaction 1  

Under different CO coverage conditions
based on the approach proposed by Nørskov et al. and Chen et
al. for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions, the Gibbs
free energy, ΔG(θ), can be calculated
according to eq 2,24,42−45 where ΔE(θ), ΔS(θ), ΔZPE, and kBT ln(θ/1 – θ) represent the contributions
of CO differential adsorption energy, entropy, zero-point energy,
and configurational entropy to ΔG(θ),
respectively. Here, coverage θ = n/N, in which n is the number of adsorbed
CO molecules on the surface and N is the total number
of the surface Cu atoms. Thus, the CO coverage-dependent equilibrium
potential U (vs RHE) can be determined when the Gibbs
free energy, ΔG(θ) is zero. 2  

The differential
adsorption energy of CO, ΔE(θ), can be
expressed by eq 3, in
which  is the total energy of the surface with
different CO coverages. 3  

Considering that the entropies of the adsorbed
molecules are small
when compared with the entropies of gaseous and that the zero-point
energy of the adsorbed CO molecules on Cu(111) is based little on
our present calculations, the contributions from the changes of entropy
and ZPE together to ΔG(θ) has been estimated
to be −0.42 eV for standard temperature (298 K) according to
the available data from Nørskov et al.25 Thus, eq 3 can be converted
to the following form of eq 4. 4  

The values of , EH2O, ECO2, and EH2 are directly available through DFT calculations.
A series of values of  can
be obtained by changing the coverage
of adsorbed CO on Cu(111). The values of ΔE(θ) at various coverages can be obtained according to eq 3 by differentiating the
plots of  against θ.

Potential-Dependent Activation Barriers
To consider
the effect of applied potential (U) on activation
barriers, Eact(U), potential-dependent
barriers are obtained by using the previously reported approach from
Asthagiri et al.,29,32 as shown in eq 5, where Eact0(U0) is the activation barrier of each elementary step at equilibrium
potential (U0) and can be directly determined
by DFT calculations when the adsorbed H species and proton–electron
pair has identical chemical potential, β is the reaction symmetry
factors. In this paper, the average value of β (ca. 0.5) is
used on the Cu surface based on the available data from Asthagiri
et al. and deemed to be a reasonable assumption by Head-Gordon et
al.46 5  

The value of equilibrium potential
(U0) is calculated by the CHE model proposed
by Nørskov et al., in which U0 of
any elementary reaction step 6 can be determined
by eq 7 when reaction
free energy is zero. The potential-dependent reaction free energies
are also able to be calculated by eq 7. 6   7  

Simultaneously, the onset potential of each elementary step
is
calculated using the approach proposed by Asthagiri et al.,32 in which a specific pathway may be able to easily
occur at room temperature. In the present paper, the threshold barrier
that can be overcome at room temperature with significant reaction
rate is assumed to be 0.4 eV based on early studies.47,48 Thus, the onset potential can be calculated by solving eq 8 for each elementary step including
proton-electron transfer process. 8
