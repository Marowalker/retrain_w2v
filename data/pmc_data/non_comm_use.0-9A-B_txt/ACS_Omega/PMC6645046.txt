Bovine and human insulin have similar
primary structures. In this article, the region of the insulin A-chain
of bovine and human insulin where the amino acid composition is different
was studied. Bovine insulin fragment (BIF) and human insulin fragment
(HIF) were synthesized in solid-phase peptide synthesis. The effects
of pH, temperature, urea, ionic strength, and stirring on the formation
of fibrils were studied using a fractional factorial resolution III
experimental design. Fibrillation was monitored by fluorescence and
infrared spectroscopy and optical microscopy. Both fragments formed
fibrils at pH 1.6 and a temperature of 60 °C. The lag time and
apparent aggregation growth rate constant were determined using a
two-parameter kinetic model. It was found that the bovine insulin
fragment has a shorter lag time than the human insulin one, whereas
the exponential phase rate was faster for HIF than for BIF. An increase
in β-sheets content with time was observed in both fragments.
The increase in β-sheets was preceded by an initial decrease
in α-helices followed by an intermediate increase during the
transition from the lag phase to elongation phase. Temperature and
ionic strength are among the most important experimental factors during
the lag phase, whereas ionic strength is replaced by pH during the
elongation phase for both the fragments. Congo red binding confirmed
the presence of ringlike oligomer structures rich in antiparallel
β-sheets,
which tend to form fibrils rich in parallel β-sheets.

Introduction
Protein aggregation
is a major problem found in the bioprocessing industry. Aggregation
can occur at any step, from production to purification and packing.1 Protein therapeutics might lose their biological
activity and cause problems during treatment if they aggregate. Proteins
can form aggregates both in their native and denatured state. They
can aggregate either during the lyophilization step or during their
long-term storage. Aggregation also happens during the unfolding/refolding
reaction in the production of recombinant proteins.

Protein
aggregation in vivo is associated with disease. Formation of amyloid
fibrils is the manifestation of various amyloidogenic diseases like
Alzheimer’s, neurofibrillary tangle, neurodegeneration, Parkinson’s,
etc. A total of 36 proteins/peptides has been identified to form amyloid
fibrils in vivo till 2016.2 Amyloid fibrils
are β-sheet rich linear aggregates formed from circular oligomers.
X-ray diffraction of amyloid fibrils shows a cross β diffraction
pattern, which is a trademark of intermolecular β-sheet structures.3−6 This intermolecular β-sheet structure is easily identified
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It has been recently
proved that oligomers are the elemental blocks to build a fibril.7,8 The propensity to form amyloid fibrils seems to be correlated with
the hydrophobicity of proteins.9 In spite
of their association with disease, amyloid aggregates can also be
used as scaffolds, as peptide hormones storage and natural adhesives.10

Although amyloid fibrils are mostly related
to disease causing proteins, it was also reported that if appropriate
incubation conditions were provided even a nonpathogenic protein can
form a fibrillar structure.11 Fibrils can
also be synthesized in vitro by subjecting the protein to favorable
destabilizing conditions.12,13 For example, hen lysozyme
incubated at pH 2.0 and 37 °C forms fibrils.14

Insulin aggregates at acidic pH and high temperature.15 Insulin is a highly conserved hormone exhibiting
minor differences in the amino acid sequence from species to species.
For instance, Ala replaces Thr at position 8, Val replaces Ile at
position 10, and Ala replaces Thr at position 30 in bovine and human
insulins, respectively.16 Our previous
studies showed that the aggregation kinetics (both lag times and rate
constants) is very different for bovine and human insulin.17 Moreover, dynamic light scattering and FTIR
experiments showed that both insulins seem to follow different aggregation
pathways as shown by different populations of aggregate sizes and
different secondary structure changes. Still, mature fibrils were
practically identical. Previously, it was demonstrated that the B
chain fragment LVEALYL plays a key role in aggregation.18 A recent review shows that different insulin
analogs show different aggregation pathways.19 In an attempt to identify the causes for those differences in the
aggregation kinetics, we decided to study fragments of the insulin
A-chain containing the sequence where bovine and human insulins are
different.16 Insulin A-chain is a 21-residue
peptide, in which only the amino acids at positions 8 and 10 differ
for bovine and human insulins.20 Bovine
insulin has alanine and valine at positions 8 and 10, whereas human
insulin has threonine and isoleucine. We selected the sequences ASVCSLYQLENK3 (bovine insulin fragment
(BIF)) and TSICSLYQLENK3 (human
insulin fragment (HIF)) for the bovine and human fragments, respectively.
Bold letters identify the amino acids that are different in both fragments.
A lysine tail was added to each fragment to increase its solubility.21

To study the effects of temperature, urea,
ionic strength, pH, and stirring on the fibrillation process, a screening
experimental design was chosen. The factors were chosen based on the
following criteria. Temperature affects protein folding and therefore
the formation of the nuclei. Urea, a known chaotropic, was chosen
to study the effect of water structure on fibril formation. Ionic
strength and pH affect coulombic interactions among the side chains
of amino acids, which affects fibrillation. Interfaces (solid/liquid
or gas/liquid) induce protein aggregation. Air was incorporated into
samples by stirring to study the effect of gas/liquid interfaces on
fibrillation. The evolution of the aggregation process with time was
monitored using a thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay. Secondary
structure changes were monitored using attenuated total reflection
(ATR)-FTIR spectroscopy. The presence of Congo red stained fibrils22 was confirmed by light microscopy.

pH,
temperature, urea, ionic strength and stirring were chosen as factors
for the experimental design. A two-level fractional factorial design
FF0508 of resolution III as shown in Table 1 consisting of five factors at two levels
each with a total of 8 runs was chosen. Each main effect in this design
was confounded with one or more two-factor interactions. The lower
and higher levels chosen for the factors are shown in Table 2.

Results and Discussion
The amino acid composition of both BIF and HIF was determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H resonance assignments for
each amino acid were done based on its corresponding proton chemical
shifts. All of the data related to proton chemical shifts were obtained
from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank.23Figure 1A,B shows the full 1H NMR spectra for BIF and HIF, respectively,
with their corresponding amino acid resonance assignments for various
protons. Both spectra look similar with a few minor differences in
the peaks at the backbone and the sidechain regions. Figure 1A has peaks at 4.25, 1.35,
4.17, and 2.28 ppm, which correspond to Ala Hα, Ala
Hβ, Val Hα, and Val Hβ and seen only in BIF. Similarly, Figure 1B has peaks at 4.38, 4.11, 3.99, and 1.78
ppm, which correspond to Thr Hα, Thr Hβ, Ile Hα, and Ile Hβ, respectively,
and seen in only HIF. Peaks assigned to rest of the amino acids are
same in both the fragments (Tables S1 and S2).

The purity and mass of both peptide
fragments were calculated from the liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) data obtained using a quadrupole time-of-flight
(Q-TOF) LC–MS system. Figures S11 and S12 show the relative abundance and mass for native BIF and HIF, respectively.
The purity of the samples was calculated based on the relative abundance
of each fraction. BIF full intact peptide (one to three lysines at
the tail) has a purity of 72%. The major impurity found in both peptides
is a fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride (Fmoc) group (mass of 164
Da) due to an inefficient final deprotection step. Fmoc-attached peptide
(impurity) is ∼28% in BIF, whereas it is ∼66% in HIF
(53% Fmoc full peptide plus 13% Fmoc with no Thr). Since the peptides
were used without further purification, it is important to determine
the composition of the fibrils obtained in the experiment using LC–MS
to estimate the effect of the impurity on fibrillation. Four samples,
one with high β-sheet content (pH 1.6, 60 °C, 1 M urea,
0.02 M NaCl) and the other with low β-sheet content (pH 5, 25
°C, 1 M urea, 0.02 M NaCl) for both BIF and HIF, were chosen
for this analysis. Aggregates formed at pH 5 and 25 °C in both
the fragments consist of 93% Fmoc (BIF)- and 100% HIF-attached peptide
in abundance, as shown in Figures S13B and S14B, whereas at pH 1.6 and 60 °C, fibrils in BIF consist of equal
amounts of native and Fmoc-attached peptide, but HIF fibrils are made
of 74% Fmoc HIF, 22% truncated Fmoc HIF, and only 4% HIF (Figures S13A and S14A). Finally, both BIF and
HIF at pH 1.6 and 60 °C show deamidation of Asn to Asp, but this
is not observed at pH 5 and 25 °C. Deamidation is favored by
low pH and high temperature. It is not clear if deamidation occurred
before, during or after the formation of the aggregates. Deamidation
may occur by acid/base catalysis as well as by intramolecular nucleophilic
catalysis.

One commonly used mechanism to explain fibril formation
consists of three phases: (1) nucleation/lag, (2) elongation/exponential
growth, and (3) equilibrium/precipitation.24 The process begins with a lag phase where there is no significant
change in the soluble peptide concentration. Nuclei/oligomer structures
are formed by partly denatured peptides.25,26 The lag phase is followed by an elongation or the exponential growth
phase where the size of the fibrils increases by addition of preformed
oligomer structures to protofilaments.27,28 Finally, it
reaches an equilibrium/precipitation phase where most of the soluble
peptide have been converted into fibrils. The process of fibril formation
was studied using ThT fluorescence assay, and the changes in the secondary
structure were simultaneously determined using ATR-FTIR. ThT bound
to amyloid-like fibrils shows a strong fluorescent signal.29 ThT dye does not bind to either soluble peptides
or to amorphous aggregates.30 ThT-induced
spectral changes for various amyloidogenic proteins are qualitatively
identical irrespective of the primary structure, this feature is important
when comparing two slightly different peptides
(Table 1 and 2).31

Figures 2 and 3 show relative fluorescence versus time at all experimental
conditions for BIF and HIF, respectively. Representative error bars
are included in both figures. Most curves show a characteristic sigmoidal
shape consisting of three regions: a lag phase, an exponential phase,
and an equilibrium phase. Therefore, the kinetics of fibril formation
can be characterized by a lag time (tlag) and an apparent aggregation growth rate constant (Kapp). The obtained sigmoidal curves for each run were
curve fitted using nonlinear curve fit in Origin Pro data analysis
software to determine tlag and Kapp by32 1  where y is the
fluorescence intensity for the normalized data, x is the time in days, x0 is the time
at 50% fluorescence intensity, and dx is the time
constant. From eq 1 the
lag time (tlag) and apparent aggregation
growth rate constant (Kapp) can be calculated
using tlag = (x0 – 2dx) and Kapp = 1/dx. The calculated lag time (tlag) and apparent aggregation growth rate constants (Kapp) for both BIF and HIF are shown in Table 3. All of the runs
for BIF formed fibrils, whereas two of the eight runs for HIF (pH
1.6, 25 °C, 1 M urea, 1 M NaCl; pH 5, 25 °C, 1 M urea, 0.02
M NaCl) are still in the lag phase after 8 weeks. This finding suggests
that HIF does not form nuclei at room temperature in the presence
of urea irrespective of the other conditions. In contrast, HIF at
room temperature in the absence of urea (pH 1.6, 25 °C, 0 M urea,
0.02 M NaCl; pH 5, 25 °C, 0 M urea, 1 M NaCl) forms fibrils.

BIF has shorter lag times than HIF under all incubation
conditions. The lag times are shorter at higher temperatures under
all conditions for both BIF and HIF. This dependence on temperature
was also observed in native bovine and human insulins.17 Though the lag times are shorter for BIF than
HIF (at the same conditions), the rate of aggregation is faster for
HIF than BIF except for run #1 (Table 1). The lag time is the shortest for BIF at pH 5, 60
°C, no urea, 0.02 M NaCl (7 ± 1 days) and it is the longest
for BIF at pH 1.6, 25 °C, 1 M urea, 1 M NaCl (16 ± 1 days).
For HIF, lag time is the shortest at pH 5, 25 °C, 0 M urea, 1
M NaCl (13 ± 2 days), whereas it is the longest at pH 1.6, 25
°C, 0 M urea, 0.02 M NaCl (30 ± 2 days). At 1 M urea and
0.02 M NaCl, samples at the lowest pH and highest temperature (BIF
and HIF at pH 1.6, 60 °C) have a shorter lag time than samples
at the highest pH and lowest temperature (BIF and HIF at pH 5, 25 °C).

Pareto charts using tlag or Kapp as an outcome are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The important factors using each outcome were identified
using the Pareto principle.33 The important
factors during lag phase are temperature, ionic strength, and urea
for BIF, whereas for HIF, temperature, pH, and ionic strength are
significant. Although all of the factors seem to be important during
the elongation phase for HIF, temperature and pH are the most important
ones, which is also true for BIF. The pH is of importance during elongation
phase as it affects the interactions among the side chains of amino
acids leading to the formation of fibrils. The presence of gas/liquid
interfaces has a negligible effect on fibrillation.

Exposure of hydrophobic surfaces to water plays an important
role in the formation of fibrils.34 Hydrophobicity
of each amino acid residue can be assigned from the native structure
according to the hydrophobicity scales of Kyte and Doolittle in the
UCSF Chimera package.35,36 The native peptide structures
were generated using a web server PEP-FOLD3.37 The structures shown in Figure 6A,B correspond to BIF and HIF. Models were visualized
using the UCSF Chimera package.36 The residues
in each peptide are shown in various colors according to their hydrophobicity.
Colors range from blue for the most hydrophilic to white (neutral)
to orange for the most hydrophobic. BIF has alanine and valine, which
are replaced by threonine and isoleucine in HIF at their respective
positions. Comparing the hydrophobicity indexes, alanine (47), valine
(79), and isoleucine (99) are very hydrophobic amino acids at both
acidic and basic pHs compared to threonine, which is a neutral amino
acid (13).38 The presence of an extra hydrophobic
residue for BIF over HIF could be the reason for shorter lag times
observed with BIF. However, BIF shows a slower growth rate than HIF.
This suggests that the nuclei of both peptides are structurally different.

in colors according to their hydrophobicity (blue: most hydrophilic,
white: neutral, orange: most hydrophobic). (A) BIF has alanine and
valine, which are both hydrophobic and (B) HIF has threonine which
is neutral and isoleucine which is hydrophobic.

The formation of intermolecular β-sheet secondary structure
is one criterion used to label an aggregate as an “amyloid
fibril”.22 The changes in the secondary
structure of peptides can be followed by FTIR.39 Moreover, ATR-FTIR plays a prominent role in differentiating
the oligomers (antiparallel β-sheets) from fibrils (parallel
β-sheets).40 Therefore, IR spectroscopy
is an alternative method to complex techniques like X-ray diffraction.41 Second-derivative analysis of the spectra allows
the determination of protein secondary structure.42 The number of peaks from the deconvolved spectra should
be chosen carefully. It is necessary to confirm that the maximum frequency
of the curve-fit peaks corresponds to the maxima evident in the raw
data to ensure that the peak is assigned to its specific secondary
structure.43 The precision of the calculated
peak areas from the second-derivative spectra largely depends on the
baseline chosen while fitting.39 Origin
Pro peak fit analysis has various baseline modes for this purpose.

The relevant region in the spectra is the amide I region (1600–1700
cm–1), which is caused by the carbonyl group stretching
vibrations from the peptide backbone.44 Each structural conformation has a unique C=O vibration dependent
on its hydrogen bonding pattern.45 One
major limitation with the spectra is that the amide I peak has a maximum
at ∼1650 cm–1 that coincides with the water
maximum absorption at ∼1643 cm–1. The water
background needs to be carefully subtracted from the spectra. The
use of an ATR attachment avoids this problem and allows data collection
with minimal use of sample.46 A flat baseline
obtained between 2200 and 1800 cm–1 is often considered
a standard to confirm proper water subtraction.47 Absorption of the side chains also causes spectral deviation
during the analysis. Carbonyl group vibrations for asparagine and
glutamine occur at around 1678 and 1670 cm–1, which
can affect the spectra.48 Urea also has
an absorption peak in the amide I region, which can be deceptive.49 Hence, during the background subtraction for
the samples in the presence of urea, 20 μL of 1 M urea was added
to the blank to subtract the undesired peaks.

FTIR analysis
of the native peptide fragments shows an α-helix content of
52.6 and 53.9% for BIF and HIF, respectively, whereas the rest of
the structure is random coils (Figures S1 and S2). The calculated secondary structures for both peptides
predicted by PEP-FOLD3 are 42.9 and 64.3% α-helix for both BIF
and HIF (the rest being random coils). The secondary structure is
calculated using DSSP, a hydrogen bond estimation based algorithm
by the secondary structure server.50 PSIPRED
and Porter 4.0 protein servers also confirmed that both the peptides
consist of α-helices and random coils.51 Comparing the experimental and theoretical values of α-helix
content, BIF has ∼82% Q3 accuracy, whereas HIF has ∼81%
Q3 accuracy, which are acceptable.52

Figure 7A shows the
FTIR spectra of BIF at pH 1.6, 60 °C, 1 M urea, and 0.02 M NaCl
collected during weeks 1 and 6. At time 0, the amide I peak is centered
at 1650 cm–1, but after 42 days the peak shifted
to 1681 cm–1. This net band shift corresponds to
an α-helix to β-sheet transition with time.53 By curve fitting the deconvoluted spectra, the
amount of each secondary structure was determined, as shown in Figure 7B, which corresponds
to BIF at the above conditions during week 1. The integration of each
curve-fitted peak yields the total secondary structure content. At
the end of week 1 (Figure 7B), three peaks are found around 1635, 1663, and 1689 cm–1. The bands around 1635 and 1689 cm–1 correspond to β-sheets/random coil and turns/antiparallel
β-sheets, respectively, whereas the peak around 1663 cm–1 can be assigned to α-helix. At the end of week
6, four peaks around 1620, 1651, 1674, and 1681 cm–1 are found. The peak at 1635 cm–1 during week 1
vanishes with time, and the presence of a peak around 1620 cm–1 during week 6 corresponds to an increase in β-sheet
content. Researchers previously reported that the fibrils show a new
β band at ∼1620 cm–1 as opposed to
the native FTIR β band at ∼1635 cm–1.54 The peaks at 1620 and 1651 cm–1 can be assigned to extended β-sheets and α-helix,
whereas the other two peaks correspond to β-turns/antiparallel
β-sheets. Similar analysis was also conducted on HIF, and the
secondary structure content was determined (Figure S3A,B). HIF peaks were located around same wavenumbers as that
of BIF (Table S3).

Figures 8 and 9 show plots for the change in
the intermolecular β-sheet content with time for both BIF and
HIF, respectively. All of the runs show an increase in the percentage
of β-sheets with time. All BIF samples have a higher percentage
of β-sheets than HIF when incubated at the same conditions.
The highest percentage of β-sheets was found in BIF (34%) and
HIF (31%) at pH 1.6, 60 °C, 1 M urea, 0.02 M NaCl. HIF at 60
°C for all runs has a higher percentage when compared to the
one at 25 °C. As it is evident from the plots, most of the increase
in β-sheets occurred in the first 2 weeks of the experiment
for BIF and in the first 3 weeks for HIF. A comparison with ThT data
shows that the β-sheet increase occurs mostly during the lag
times (12 days for BIF and 21 days for HIF). Thus, the progression
of lag phase to the elongation phase in both the fragments can be
assigned to the increase in the number of β-sheets and their
extension to form fibril.

The samples HIF at pH 1.6, 25
°C, 1 M urea, 1 M NaCl and at pH 5, 25 °C, 1 M urea, 0.02
M NaCl are still in the lag phase at the end of the experiment, they
have β-sheet contents of 25.1 and 24.6%, respectively. There
is no specific criterion as to how much of β-sheet percentage
qualifies to be an amyloid fibril. According to ThT data, HIF at pH
5, 25 °C, 0 M urea, 1 M NaCl forms fibrils, whereas HIF at pH
1.6, 25 °C, 1 M urea, 1 M NaCl and at pH 5, 25 °C, 1 M urea,
0.02 M NaCl do not; despite the fact that both peptides reach an almost
identical percentage of β-sheets. Although there is an increase
in the β-sheet content with time for the rest of the runs, these
two runs have a constant β-sheet content. These results are
consistent with the ThT data (Figure 3).

The data shown in Figures 8 and 9 were normalized
and fitted with 2  where y is the normalized
β-sheet percentage, t is the time in weeks,
and Kβ is the rate of increase in
β-sheets. Figure 10A,B shows the curve-fitted β-sheet plots for BIF and
HIF, respectively. All of the fitted curves have an R2 value of at least 97%. The Kβ values calculated for BIF and HIF are shown in Table 4. Kβ values for BIF are similar for all of the runs, but the Kβ values for HIF are larger at 60 °C
than at 25 °C. At 25 °C, the rate of increase in β-sheets
was higher in BIF than HIF, whereas at 60 °C, the rates were
similar. The Kβ value decreased
with an increase in both urea and NaCl concentrations irrespective
of other conditions. Using Kβ as
an outcome, Pareto analysis was conducted to determine the important
factors (Figure S10). Temperature and pH
are the most significant factors for HIF, which is also true for the
lag and elongation phases from ThT data (Figures 4B and 5B). Ionic strength
and urea are the most important factors for BIF. This is also true
for BIF during lag phase, but during the elongation phase, temperature
and pH are more important.

Figure 11A,B shows a plot of percentage change in
the α-helix content with time for BIF and HIF, respectively,
for all runs. Both fragments show a decrease in α-helices with
time. Though there is consistent decrease in the α-helix content
in both fragments during the lag phase, a slight increase in α-helices
can be seen during the transition from lag phase to elongation phase.
Formation of α-helical rich intermediates was also reported
previously in the fibrillation of α-synuclein.55,56

FTIR analysis was also used to distinguish oligomers
from fibrils. Oligomers are rich in antiparallel β-sheets (1695–1680
cm–1), whereas fibrils are rich in parallel β-sheets
(1635–1620 cm–1).40 We calculated the β-index i.e., the ratio of (% of turns +
antiparallel β-sheets) to % of parallel β-sheets using
a similar protocol as previously mentioned.57 The β-index as a function of time was plotted for both the
fragments, as shown in Figure S17. Its
value decreases with increasing time, which shows that samples rich
in antiparallel β-sheets (oligomers) convert to parallel β-sheet
rich fibrils. That transition from antiparallel to parallel β-sheets
confirms that oligomers are the base unit of fibrillation.

The
presence of fibrils was further confirmed using optical microscope.
A recent NMR study shows that Congo red binding is specific to fibrils.58 The combination of ThT and Congo red assays
minimizes confounding because they are independent assays.59 Micrographs shown in Figure 12 contain irregular proteinaceous deposits
when stained with Congo red. These micrographs demonstrate the amyloid
properties for BIF and HIF at pH 1.6, 60 °C, 1 M urea, 0.02 M
salt (Figure 12A,B)
and pH 5, 60 °C, 0 M urea, 0.02 M salt (Figure 12C,D), respectively. At pH 1.6, BIF forms
amyloid plaques (Figure 12A), whereas HIF forms distinct annular amyloid aggregates
(Figure 12B).60 The maximum fluorescence intensity (Figures S1 and S2) represents the maximum aggregation
growth. This is higher in HIF compared to BIF at pH 1.6, which explains
the morphological differences. Similarly, it is the same at pH 5 for
both fragments showing aggregates of similar morphology.

Conclusions
Two peptide fragments of insulin A-chain with
subtle differences in their primary structure were synthesized, and
their fibrillation propensity was studied using fluorescence and infrared
spectroscopy. We found that the bovine insulin fragments have a shorter
lag time in comparison with the human insulin ones, but for most samples,
the exponential phase rate was faster for HIF than for BIF. Fibrillation
kinetics, which is dependent on pH and temperature, may have been
affected by the presence of an Fmoc-attached peptide. An increase
in β-sheets content with time was observed in both fragments.
The increase in β-sheets was preceded by an initial decrease
in α-helices followed by an intermediate increase during the
transition from the lag phase to elongation phase. The conversion
of oligomer structures rich in antiparallel β-sheets to fibrils
rich in parallel β-sheets is a characteristic of amyloid. The
observed α-helix to β-sheet transition as well as the
micrographs obtained using Congo red staining confirmed the formation
of ringlike oligomer structures rich in antiparallel β-sheets,
which then form fibrils rich in parallel β-sheets.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All Fmoc amino acids, Wang resin and (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate)
(HBTU) were purchased from CSBIO Co. ThT was purchased from Acros
Organics. Piperidine, dimethylformamide (DMF), trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA), N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIPEA), and deuterium oxide; 99.9 atom % deuterium (D) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. All other solvents were purchased from Fischer
Scientific.

Peptide Synthesis
The peptides BIF
and HIF were synthesized in a CSBio 336 peptide synthesizer using
Fmoc technique in solid-phase peptide synthesis.61 Wang resin (0.5 mmol/g) was used as a solid support matrix
for this purpose, and the synthesis was carried out from the C- to
the N-terminus.62 One millimole per synthesis
of each Fmoc amino acid was used. Deprotection of Fmoc group was done
using 20% piperidine in DMF. HBTU combined with DIPEA was used as
an activator to facilitate the coupling of amino acids. The complete
synthesis took approximately 18 h. The product from the reaction vessel
was suspended in dichloromethane, and the peptide was cleaved from
the swollen resin using 95% TFA. The cleaved peptide was then resuspended
in cold diethyl ether and centrifuged twice using RC-3B refrigerated
centrifuge (Sorvall Instruments) at 4650g, −5
°C for 30 min. The obtained pellet was dissolved in 10 mM acetic
acid and lyophilized to obtain the final peptide fragment.

NMR Spectroscopy
The amino acid composition of the peptides was confirmed using
liquid state one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. Samples
for the analysis were prepared by dissolving 10 mg of the peptide
in 750 μL D2O (99.9% deuterium). Spectra were obtained
using a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer equipped with a BBO probe. 1H NMR data were obtained with a sweep width of 3997.8 MHz,
0.256 s acquisition time, 16 scans, and a 2 s recycle delay.

Mass Spectrometry
To determine the purity and the mass of the peptides, LC–MS
data were acquired on an Agilent 6520 Q-TOF LC–MS system. Lyophilized
peptides were suspended in 0.1% formic acid in water to obtain a final
concentration of 1 mg/mL. Five microliter of the sample was loaded
on an Agilent Technologies 43 mm C18 Chip column. Agilent Technologies
1200 Series Quaternary high-performance liquid chromatograph was used.
LC gradient: initial conditions 3% B (A: 0.1% formic acid in water;
B: 99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), gradient to 80% B over 9
min, hold at 80% B for 3 min, ramp back to (0.5 min) and hold at (2.5
min) initial conditions. An Agilent Technologies 6520A Accurate Mass
Q-TOF MS with integrated Chip Cube source was used to collect data.
Data across a total of 15 min of elution were collected. MS data were
collected between 295 and 2500 m/z, and MS/MS data were collected between 70 and 2500 m/z at 2 spectra/s. Peptides with counts >2000
were picked for MS/MS.

LC–MS for the fibrils was obtained
using an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. Samples were precipitated
using ice-cold acetone. The pellet was recovered by centrifugation
(16 000g) and washed twice with 80% acetone
(in water). The pellet was dried and resuspended in 100 μL of
urea buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate).
No particulates were observed, suggesting fibrils were completely
dissolved in the buffer.

In Vitro Fibrillation
Samples were
prepared with a peptide concentration of 10 mg/mL. A total of 16 samples,
eight for each fragment varying the experimental conditions were made.
All of the samples were prepared in 0.22 μm filtered phosphate
buffer at their respective pH (1.6 and 5). Urea and sodium chloride
with two different concentrations were added. Samples were incubated
with ThT at two different temperatures (25 and 60 °C) under stirring
and no stirring conditions. The evolution of the fibrillation process
with time was followed by fluorescence assay, and the changes in secondary
structure were studied using FTIR. The water used for the preparation
of buffers was purified to a resistivity of 17.5 MΩ cm.

ThT Fluorescence
Assay
ThT assay was done using a NanoDrop 3300 Fluorospectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) using white light as the excitation source
(460–650 nm). The emission wavelength was set to 482 nm. Free
dye has an excitation wavelength of 385 nm and an emission wavelength
of 445 nm. A stock solution for the ThT assay was prepared by adding
0.8 mg of ThT dye to 50 mL of 0.22 μm filtered phosphate buffer
(pH 7) and stored at 4 °C in a dark place to prevent quenching.
ThT solution (0.05 mM) was added to each sample at the beginning of
incubation. A ThT solution with only the buffer was used as a blank
for the assay. Fluorescence for each sample was recorded every 3 days.
Increase in viscosity or the appearance of gel/precipitate with time
upon visual inspection is a characteristic of the ThT assay.22 All of the reported fluorescence readings were
an average of five replicates.

FTIR Analysis
Analysis was carried out with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer from
Thermoscientific equipped with a KBr beam-splitter and a DTGC detector
cooled by liquid nitrogen. A smart performer attenuated total reflectance
sampling accessory with a germanium (Ge) crystal was used. Interferograms
were obtained for each sample at a resolution of 16 cm–1, and 256 scans were collected for each run to obtain a good signal-to-noise
ratio.

Congo Red Staining
Congo red dye was used to stain
and obtain the micrographs of the fibrils. A stock solution was prepared
by adding 7 mg of Congo red to 1 mL of 0.22 μm filtered water.
Samples containing fibrils were first centrifuged using a microcentrifuge
at 9450g and then washed thoroughly with water. The
pellet was then resuspended in 1 mL of water, and 5 μL of Congo
red solution was added and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. After
obtaining a red precipitate, the sample was centrifuged again. The
pellet was washed twice with water to remove the unattached dye. The
fibrils were then resuspended in a small amount of water. Congo red
stained fibrils (30 μL) were placed on a microscopic slide and
air-dried. Micrographs were obtained at 1000× using Hirox KH-8700
digital microscope.
