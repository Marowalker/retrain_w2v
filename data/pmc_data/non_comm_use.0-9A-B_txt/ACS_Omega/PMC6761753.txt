In
this paper, a hydroxyapatite (HAp)-doped carbon nanofiber (CNF)-modified
carbon ionic liquid electrode (CILE) was prepared and used for the
investigation on the direct electrochemistry and electrocatalysis
of myoglobin (Mb). HAp nanoparticles were mixed within a polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) solution, and a HAp@PAN nanofiber was synthesized by electrospinning
process, which was further controlled by carbonization at 800 °C
for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere to get a HAp@CNF nanocomposite. Various
techniques were used to check the physicochemical properties of HAp@CNF.
Mb was mixed with a HAp@CNF dispersion solution and casted on the
surface of CILE to obtain an electrochemical sensing platform. The
direct electrochemistry of Mb on the modified electrode was checked
when a pair of enhanced redox waves appeared, indicating the direct
electron transfer of Mb. HAp@CNF exhibited high conductivity, good
biocompatibility, and large surface area, which was beneficial for
Mb immobilization. The modified electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic
activity toward the reduction of trichloroacetic acid and sodium nitrite,
which was further used to establish a new electroanalytical method.
Real samples were analyzed by the proposed method with satisfactory
results.

1 Introduction
Electrostatic
spinning is a commonly used method that originated
from Formalas’ patent and extended by Reneker’s researches,1,2 which can be used for the rapid preparation of nanofibers with advantages
such as being a simple device, low spinning cost, having a variety
of spinnable materials, and controllable fiber scale.3 Nanofibers that exhibit various structures and morphologies,
including inorganic fiber, inorganic/organic hybrid fiber, and organic
fiber, can be synthesized by this method.4−6 As shown in Figure 1, an electrostatic
spinning device is commonly composed of a high voltage supply, spinneret
device, and target electrode.7 By changing
the experimental conditions such as the properties of the polymer
solution, electric field intensity, and environmental conditions,
electrostatic spinning technology is available to synthesize nanofibers
with different diameters and densities,8 which have been widely used in biomedicine for bone components,
drug carriers, and sensing applications.9−12 Also, the nanofiber manufactured
from the organic polymers can be used for further fabrication of carbon
nanofibers (CNFs) by high-temperature carbonization, which is a simple
way for CNF preparation. For example, Kong et al. prepared a silicon
nanoparticle-doped polyacrylonitrile (PAN) composite from electrostatic
spinning and applied it to a lithium ion battery with good electrochemical
properties.13

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
electrostatic spinning, high-temperature carbonization,
electrode fabrication, and electrochemical application.

CNF is a kind of carbon nanomaterial with graphitic frameworks,
high surface area, and specific conductive properties. Therefore,
CNF has been widely used in various applications such as electrochemical
biosensors, batteries, and catalyst supports.14−16 Sun et al.
prepared a nitrogen-doped CNF-modified carbon paste electrode (CPE)
to determine bisphenol A.17 Adabi et al.
investigated the performance of electrodes that were modified with
PAN-based CNFs.18 Arkan et al. constructed
an electrochemical sensor with TiO2 nanoparticles and electrospun
CNF-modified CPE for the determination of idarubicin in biological
samples.19 Apetrei et al. prepared a gold
nanoparticle/CNF-modified screen-printed carbon electrode to detect
pyritinol in various samples.20 Sakthivel
et al. used a CoFeSe2 nanosphere and functionalized CNF
composite-modified electrode for the electrochemical detection of
caffeic acid.21

Hydroxyapatite (HAp)
is an important component of the human skeleton
and vertebrate hard tissue with excellent biocompatibility and biological
activity,22,23 which can be used in the medical fields
for spinal fusion and bone defect treatment.24,25 Also, HAp and its related composites can be used in electrochemical
sensors. For example, El Mhammedi et al. proposed a HAp-modified CPE
for para-nitrophenol detection.26 Kanchana and Sekar reported the application of HAp as a
sensing element for the electrochemical determination of folic acid.27 Gao et al. utilized HAp and reduced graphene
oxide or a carbon nanotube-modified electrode as an electrochemical
sensor for the detection of hydrazine28 and luteolin.29 Pang et al. developed
an electrochemical method for the determination of luteolin based
on graphene and a HAp nanocomposite-modified glassy carbon electrode.30 The combination of HAp with CNF can exhibit
excellent synergistic effects and overcome some shortcomings such
as the hydrophobicity of CNF and the low electron transfer ability
of HAp. Wu et al. synthesized nanofibers by electrostatic spinning
technology with HAp grown on the surface of CNFs.31

Myoglobin (Mb) is an oxygen heme protein that is
mainly distributed
in the myocardial and skeletal muscle tissue, which is composed of
a single polypeptide and heme with the peptide chain coiled into a
globular structure and heme packaged inside the cavitation. Heme is
composed of ferroporphyrins that acted as an electroactive center
in the redox reaction to lose and obtain electrons. Hence, Mb is commonly
used as the model redox protein in the electrochemical sensor.32−35

In this paper, a HAp-doped PAN nanocloth was obtained by electrostatic
spinning technology, which was carbonized at a high temperature to
get a HAp-doped CNF (HAp@CNF). Then, HAp@CNF was mixed with the Mb
solution and used as the modifier for the preparation of the electrochemical
biosensor. By using a carbon ionic liquid electrode (CILE) as the
substrate electrode, the modified electrode was named as Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE
and used as the working electrode in the electrochemical investigations.
Direct electrochemical behaviors of Mb on the modified electrode were
investigated by cyclic voltammetry when a pair of quasi-reversible
redox peaks appeared, indicating that the existence of HAp@CNF accelerated
the rate of electron transfer between Mb and a basal electrode. Then,
the modified electrode was further used for the electrocatalytic reduction
of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations
of the Materials
Figure 2 displays
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of CNF and HAp@CNF with
different magnifications. It can be seen that the CNF exhibited a
smooth surface with an average diameter of 220 nm, and HAp@CNF gave
a rough fiber surface with irregular HAp clearly observed on the surface
of CNF. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of HAp@CNF proved
that HAp was distributed homogeneously in CNF (Figure 2e,f). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
results can be used to characterize the chemical structure and elemental
composition on the surface of HAp@CNF. As shown in Figure 2g, the peaks of CNF were attributed
to C1s, N1s, and O1s. The spectrum of HAp@CNF with new peaks of Ca2s,
Ca2p, P2s, and P2p indicated that HAp crystals were successfully doped
within the CNF.31 The Raman spectrum gave
two peaks at 1326.8 and 1583.5 cm–1 (Figure 2h), which were attributed to
two characteristic bands of D and G bands, respectively. The D band
was attributed to the vibration of carbon atoms in disordered carbon
structures, whereas the G band was related to the in-plane vibration
of sp2 carbon atoms. The intensity ratio of ID/IG was calculated to be
1.06, which indicated a high-level disorder of HAp@CNF.36,37

Spectroscopic results of Mb and Mb-HAp@CNF were further checked
with the data shown in Figure S1. The peak
positions remained unchanged in Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
and UV–vis spectroscopy, which proved that Mb remained its
natural structures after mixing with HAp@CNF due to its biocompatibility.

2.2 Direct Electrochemical Behavior of the Mb-Modified
Electrodes
Figure 3a–d shows the cyclic voltammetric responses of Nafion/CILE,
Nafion/HAp@CNF/CILE, Nafion/Mb/CILE, and Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/ CILE,
respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 3.0) at a scan
rate of 100 mV s–1. On Nafion/CILE and Nafion/HAp@CNF/CILE,
no electrochemical responses were observed, which indicated that no
electrochemical reaction took place. On Nafion/Mb/CILE, a pair of
redox couples with a deformed shape indicated a slow electron transfer
rate. With the further incorporation of HAp@CNF on the modified electrode,
a pair of well-defined quasi-reversible redox peaks appeared with
a formal peak potential (E0′) of −0.196 V and a peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp) of 66 mV. Therefore, the presence of the HAp@CNF nanocomposite
on the electrode surface could improve the electron transfer of Mb
with the underlying electrode. CNF has been proven to be an effective
conductor for electron transfer due to its carbon nature with long-distance
electron communication ability. HAp is a biocompatible material for
Mb to retain the biostructure without deformation. Also, the presence
of HAp in CNF can modulate the interfacial hydrophilicity of the composite,
which enables the easy interaction of Mb with HAp@CNF. The interfacial
information of the modified electrode can be tested by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with the data shown in Figure S2. The Ret values of Nafion/HAp@CNF/CILE,
Nafion/CILE, Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE, and Nafion/Mb/CILE were calculated
to be 19.8, 46.7, 77.1, and 110.2 Ω, respectively, indicating
that the presence of HAp@CNF was beneficial for the electron transfer
with the decrease in the interfacial resistance.

(c) Nafion/Mb/CILE, and (d) Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE in pH 3.0 PBS at
a scan rate of 100 mV s–1.

2.3 Electrochemical Investigations
The
influence of the scan rate on the electrochemical behaviors of Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE
was studied by cyclic voltammetry with the results shown in Figure 4A. The redox peak
currents varied linearly with scan rate in the range of 0.05–1.0
V s–1, and the linear regression relationships were
shown in Figure 4B,
indicating a thin-layer surface-controlled electrochemical behavior.
The redox peak potentials were also shifted gradually with the increase
of peak-to-peak separation (ΔEp), and Figure 4C shows the linear regression relationships
of Ep with ln υ. According to Laviron’s
equations,38 the values of the electron
transfer number (n), the electron transfer coefficient
(α), and the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant (ks) were estimated to be 0.95, 0.45, and 1.10
s–1, respectively. The obtained ks value was larger than some of the reported values for
different Mb-modified electrodes with the compared results shown in Table 1, which indicated
that HAp@CNF on CILE formed a conductive network for Mb with a faster
electron transfer rate. The effect of buffer pH on the direct electrochemical
behavior of Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE was further investigated in PBS
with a pH range of 3.0–8.0. As shown in Figure 4D, the redox peak potential of Mb moved to
a negative direction, indicating that the proton was involved in electrode
reaction. E0′ had a
good linear relationship with buffer pH, and the linear regression
equation was obtained as E0′ (V) = −0.0541pH + 0.016 (n = 6, γ
= 0.994). The slope value of −54.1 mV pH –1 was close to the theoretical value of the Nernst equation (−59.0
mV pH –1) for a one-electron and one-proton transfer
reversible electrode reaction. Furthermore, the biggest peak current
was observed at pH 3.0, which was chosen as a supporting electrolyte
for electrochemical investigation, and a sufficient amount of protons
were present at this condition.

2.4 Electrocatalytic
Activity
The elecrocatalytic
activity of Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE to TCA and NaNO2 was
investigated by cyclic voltammetry with the results shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5A, the addition of
different concentrations of TCA resulted in the increase in the reduction
peak current when the oxidation peak disappeared and the second reduction
peak appeared simultaneously at −0.528 V, indicating a typical
electrocatalytic behavior of the redox protein-modified electrode.45 A good linear relationship of TCA concentration
with a reduction peak current (Ipc) was obtained
(inset of Figure 5A)
in the range of 6.0–180.0 mM. The linear regression equation
was Ipc (μA) = 6.82C (mM)
+ 33.02 (n = 22, γ = 0.998) with the limit
of detection (LOD) of 2.0 mM (3σ). When the concentration of
TCA was more than 180.0 mM, the peak current reached to a platform,
which was the characteristic of Michaelis–Menten kinetics performance.
The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (KMapp) could be calculated to be 0.224 M, which was
due to the presence of the CNF network with an excellent electrical
conductivity and large specific surface area that increased the load
amount of Mb molecules on the electrode surface.

5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 10.0 mM; inset shows the linear
relationship of catalytic peak currents and the NaNO2 concentration);
scan rate, 100 mV s–1.

The elecrocatalytic activity of Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE with different
concentrations of NaNO2 was checked with the typical cyclic
voltammograms shown in Figure 5B. A new reduction peak was found at −0.798 V, and
the reduction peak current increased with the NaNO2 concentration
in two sections (0.3–1.6 and 2.0–10.0 mM) with two linear
regression equations: Ip (μA) = 50.1C (mM) + 17.4 (n = 9, γ = 0.992)
and Ip (μA) = 3.93C (mM) +
99.0 (n = 10, γ = 0.995). The LOD was calculated
to be 0.23 mM (3σ), and the KMapp was estimated to be 1.13 mM.

A comparison of this
method with other reported results is summarized
and compared in Table 2 for TCA and Table 3 for NaNO2, which indicated a relatively wider linear
range or lower detection limit for the detection of the target analytes.

2.5 Analytical Application
In order to
verify the real application of this electrochemical sensor, the TCA
content in the medical facial peel sample was checked by the standard
addition method. A 10 μL medical facial peel solution (35%)
was diluted by 0.1 M PBS (pH 3.0) to a final 10 mL volume to get the
sample solution, which was put into an electrochemical cell and detected
by the three-electrode system. As shown in Table 4, the recovery was calculated from 94.7 to
106.0%, indicating the practical application in drug sample detection.

3 Conclusions
HAp@CNF was synthesized by an electrostatic spinning HAp@PAN solution
with the following high-temperature carbonization process, which was
used for the electrode modification with direct electrochemistry of
Mb realized. The fabricated Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE showed a pair of
well-defined redox peaks on cyclic voltammograms with an enhanced
electrochemical response, indicating that the HAp@CNF nanocomposite
was beneficial to enhance the electrochemical signal of Mb on the
electrode. The modified electrode showed excellent electrocatalytic
reductions for TCA and NaNO2 with a wide linear response
and high sensitivity, which could also be applied to detect the TCA
content in the medical facial peel solution.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Reagents
PAN (MW
150,000; J&K Chem. Co., China), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; Xilong Chem. Co., China), Mb (MW, 17,800, Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA), 1-hexylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate
(HPPF6; Lanzhou Yulu Fine Chem. Ltd. Co., China), graphite
powder (particle size, 30 μm; Shanghai Colloid Chem. Co., China),
TCA (Tianjin Kemiou Chem. Ltd. Co., China), NaNO2 (Yantai
Sahe Chem. Ltd. Co., China), and medical facial peel (35%; Shanghai
EKEAR Biotech. Ltd. Co., China) were used as received. HAp was synthesized
based on the reported procedure.56 The
supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
which was deoxygenated with pure nitrogen before the experiments.
All the other chemicals were of analytical grade, and the solutions
were prepared by using double distilled water.

4.2 Instruments
Voltammetry and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed with CHI 1210A and CHI
660D electrochemical workstations (Shanghai CH Instrument, China),
respectively. A three-electrode system was used for the electrochemical
experiments, which was composed of the working electrode (Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE),
the auxiliary electrode (platinum wire electrode), and the reference
electrode (saturated calomel electrode). Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was performed by a JSM-7100F scanning electron microscope (JEOL,
Japan) with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on a JEM 2010F
instrument (JEOL, Japan). Raman spectrum was obtained on a LabRAM
HR system using 532 nm lasers (Horiba, France) with X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) on an AXIS HIS 165 spectrometer (Kratos Analytical,
UK). FT-IR was carried out using a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). UV–vis spectroscopy was
recorded on a TU-1901 double-beam UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Beijing General Instrument Ltd. Co., China). The carbonization process
was performed by a BTF-1200C vacuum tube furnace (Anhui Best Equipment
Technology Ltd. Co., China).

4.3 Synthesis of the HAp@CNF
Nanocomposite
HAp@CNF was synthesized by electrospinning
the PAN and HAp mixture
with the following carbonization. In general, 0.4 g of HAp was dispersed
into 10 mL of DMF with the addition of 1.6 g of PAN, which was stirred
completely to form a pale yellow colloidal solution. The parameters
for electrostatic spinning were set as follows: the voltage of 8.80
kV, the flow rate of jet spinning of 12 μL min–1, the distance of the needle to the receiver of 12 cm, and the cylinder
receiver rotated with a speed of 940 rpm. The resulted HAp-doped PAN
nanocloth was placed in a tube furnace and heated at 800 °C for
2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the HAp@CNF nanocomposite could
be obtained after cooling down to room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere.

4.4 Preparation of Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE
CILE
was manufactured as a basal electrode with 0.8 g of HPPF6 and 1.6 g of graphite powder, which were mixed and ground
carefully to form a homogeneous carbon paste. Then, it was packed
into a glass tube electrode (Φ = 4.0 mm), and the electrical
contact was established through a copper wire at the end of the paste.
The CILE surface was polished on a weighing paper before use.

HAp@CNF was ground in a mortar to a black powder, and a 3.0 mg mL–1 HAp@CNF dispersion solution was prepared by ultrasound
and oscillation, which was mixed with a 30 mg mL–1 Mb solution and shocked to a homogeneous mixture. Then, 8 μL
of Mb-HAp@CNF dispersion was casted on the surface of CILE and dried
at room temperature to get the modified electrode (Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE).
Finally, 6 μL of 0.5% Nafion solution was spread on Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE
to get the modified electrode (Nafion/Mb-HAp@CNF/CILE).

4.5 Analytical Procedure
Electrochemical
measurement was operated in 0.1 M pH 3.0 PBS that was deoxygenated
by purified nitrogen for 30 min before the experiments. UV–vis
absorption spectroscopic experiments were performed with a mixture
solution composed of Mb and HAp@CNF with the wavelength scanned from
300 to 600 nm. The film of the Mb solution and Mb-HAp@CNF solution
dried on a glass slide was scraped for FT-IR experiments.
