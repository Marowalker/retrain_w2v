A new patented method for the synthesis
of nanosized powders of
indium(III) hydroxide and oxide using the strong base anion exchange
resin AV-17-8 as a precipitate agent was proposed. The effect of anions
of the initial indium salt and the influence of the process duration,
temperature, and counterions of resin such as hydroxide or carbonate
on the yield of indium(III) hydroxide during the anion resin exchange
precipitation were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, electrical
conductivity measurement method, and atomic absorption analysis. Based
on the obtained data, the mechanism of the anion resin exchange precipitation
of indium(III) hydroxide was suggested. The products were characterized
by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning
calorimetry, elemental analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that impurity-free
monophasic In2O3 powders with an average particle
size of 10–15 nm and specific surface area of 62–73
m2/g were formed after heat treatment of as-prepared products
at 400 °C.

==== Body
Introduction
Indium(III) oxide, In2O3, is an optically
transparent (in the visible range (80–90%)) semiconductor oxide
with high electrical conductivity. Thus, In2O3 is widely used for the production of numerous optical electronic
devices equipped with touch screen, LCD, and plasma TVs, solar cells,
and highly sensitive gas sensors.1−5 In electronics, one of the most popular materials is indium tin
oxide (ITO), representing a mixture of In2O3 and SnO2, usually in a mass ratio of 9:1.6,7

Generally, the materials based on indium oxide are obtained
from
the high-reactive precursor In(OH)3 because their characteristics
directly affect the properties of the product. Therefore, the development
of new synthetic strategies for the production of indium(III) hydroxide
with chemical homogeneity, containing particles of similar size and
morphology, is a current problem.

The most common methods used
to synthesize In(OH)3 are
the chemical precipitation from salt solution,8−12 hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis,13−18 sol–gel process,19,20 and their combinations.21,22 In the case of the solvothermal (hydrothermal) process, the initial
salts of indium or as-precipitated In(OH)3 are kept in
an autoclave in aqueous solution or organic solvents at high temperature
and pressure, usually, in the presence of surfactants.
This approach allows one to obtain products with precisely defined
morphology (nanorods, nanocubes, hollow spheres, etc.), and the finest
products as compared with other methods. However, the solvothermal
method requires the use of complex, expensive equipment, high pressure,
being limited by the small size of the reaction chambers. For the
sol–gel synthesis, expensive gel-forming components are used,
and long synthesis time is required, as well as the control of the
hydrolysis rate of the initial reagents to avoid microheterogeneity
in the system.

The chemical precipitation method requires the
control of the pH
value and reaction conditions. Also, as-prepared precipitate particles
tend to trap the mother liquor ions; therefore, long-term thorough
washing is needed to remove all the adsorbed species, which results
in the formation of a large amount of rinsing water subjected to disposal.
Each technique presented has some disadvantages; therefore, the creation
of new modifications of the known method is an urgent problem.

For the synthesis of precursors of oxide materials, the so-called
anion resin exchange precipitation of metal ions is perspective.23−26 Ion exchange resins are widely used in different separation, purification,
and decontamination processes. In the case of anion resin exchange
precipitation, a resin or polymer acts as a reagent. This method involves
two combined heterogeneous reactions: anion exchange between the sorbent
solution and precipitation of an insoluble metal compound from the
solution. The process of obtaining In(OH)3 can be described
by the equations: 1   2  R is the anion exchange resin
(A = Cl–, 1/2SO42–,
NO3–).

This process should be considered
as a special case of ion exchange
complicated by the precipitation reaction. The method results in nearly
complete conversion of reagents and high selectivity, reducing material
and energy costs associated with eliminating the necessity of additional
purification of products, and, as a result, simplifying the technology
design of production, as reported in ref (27).

Herein, we provide patented by us28 the
anion resin exchange precipitation method to obtain In(OH)3 and In2O3 nanopowders. As far as we know,
the anion resin exchange precipitation method was not used earlier
to produce these materials. The influence of various conditions on
this process was investigated, and the obtained products were characterized.

Results
and Discussion
Anion Resin Exchange Precipitation of Indium(III)
Hydroxide
To control reactions 1 and 2, the specific electrical
conductivity
of the reaction solutions was measured during the synthesis (Figure 1). The chemical reaction
of the anion resin exchange precipitation reduces the number of ions
in the solution because the anions of the initial indium salt are
absorbed by the resin and the In3+ ions are bound into
a solid product with ions from the resin: In-OH for the OH form and
In-CO3 for R-CO3. Uncharged species in the solution
do not carry any charge, and then a decrease of the specific electrical
conductivity of the reaction solution is observed. As we discussed
earlier,29 in the case of the anion resin
exchange precipitation, the charge and diameter of hydrated anions
are the main factors affecting the effectiveness of the process. As
can be seen in Figure 1a, when In2(SO4)3 is used, the SEC
of the solution goes down to zero rapidly (30 min), and the formation
of a dense white precipitate is observed. In the case of using other
indium salts, In(NO3)3 or InCl3,
after 1 h, the SEC reaches about 100 μS/m and remains constant
over time. Moreover, the precipitate formation does not occur, but
sols are formed, which are transformed into gels with time. In general,
the extent of precipitation of indium ions decreases in the row In2(SO4)3 > InCl3 ≈
In(NO3)3, which is in agreement with the order
of affinity
for strongly basic anion exchangers.27 In
the subsequent experiments, the anion resin exchange precipitation
of indium was carried out only from its sulfate solutions.

Figure 1 Time dependence
of the specific electrical conductivity (SEC) of
the reaction solutions during the anion resin exchange precipitation:
(a) In-OH from 1: In2(SO4)3, 2: InCl3, 3: In (NO3)3; (b) 1: In-OH; 2: In-CO3 from In2(SO4)3.

Figure 1b
shows
a change over time for the specific electrical conductivity of the
solutions during the anion resin exchange precipitation of indium(III)
sulfate in the presence of the resins in OH and CO3 forms.
The SEC of the solution is dramatically decreased to 0 during 10 min
by using the resin in the carbonate form, whereas in the case of the
OH form, the conductivity at the time is 200 μS/m (Figure 1b). In addition,
the molar fraction of In3+ (χ) in contact solution
during 10 min after the start of the synthesis is also decreased to
2% when the resin in the carbonate form was used (Figure 2, curve 3b), whereas during
the same time, χ decreased to 20% in the presence of the resin
in OH form (Figure 2, curve 3a). This result may be explained by a higher pH value of
the solution when using the anion exchange resin in the carbonate
form (Table 1). This
is probably due to a more intensive emission of the acid gas CO2. However, the indium hydroxide amount when it is an individual
phase increases faster if we use the resin in the OH form (Figure 2, curves 1a and 1b).
At the same time, a significant amount of indium hydroxide is deposited
on the resin bead surface. The indium ions detected in the resin phase
(Figure 2, curves 2a
and 2b) are caused by the dissolution of surface deposit In(OH)3 during the acid treatment of the resin. It is noticeable
that the sorption of indium cations by the strong base anion exchanger
resin is excluded due to the positive Donnan potential at the interface.

fraction of In3+ (χ) in the phases: 1: precipitate,
2: anion exchange resin, 3: contact solution during the anion exchange
precipitation of (a) In-OH and (b) In-CO3.

6	60	15	7.5	2	87	
Then, during further precipitation, the product yield (Figure 2, curves 1a and 1b)
increased up to 96 and 88% during 24 h for OH and CO3 forms
of the resin, respectively. At the same time, the amount of indium
in the resin phase decreased.

According to electron microscopy
(Figure 3), after 15
min of the synthesis, the surface
of the resin beads was almost completely covered by a layer of a surface
deposit. These data are given for the carbonate form of resin, and
the results obtained for OH form are similar. The surface deposit
started to flake away from the resin beads after 30–60 min
since the areas of the cleared bead surfaces could be seen. The deposit
is assumed to have been exfoliated when reaching a thickness of about
1 μm. The SEM data revealed that the complete desorption occurred
within 24 h.

Figure 3 SEM micrographs of the grain surface of the anion resin
AV-17-8
(CO3) during the synthesis of In-CO3.

Thus, we can suggest the following mechanism of
the anion resin
exchange precipitation of indium(III) hydroxide: the anion exchange
between the anions of indium solution and the resin, the formation
of indium hydroxide on the surface of the resin beads, exfoliation
of the deposit layer after increasing the thickness to 1 μm
and more, and deposition onto the vessel bottom as an individual product
phase. Moreover, these processes occur almost simultaneously.

As can be seen in Figure 3, the deposit layer has cracks through which the diffusion
might occur. Therefore, the precipitate on the surface of the grain
does not block ion exchange but reduces the rate, and the process
continues until a complete conversion of the reagents occurs. The
rate-limiting stage of the overall process is the surface deposit
desorption. It is assumed that in the case of the resin in CO3 form, a closer deposit with higher adhesive properties is
formed; therefore, more time is needed for it to flake away than in
the case of using the anion exchanger in hydroxide form.

To
increase the desorption rate and decrease the adsorbed metal
amount, the process was carried out at 60 °C. The effect of increasing
temperature produced a positive impact on the product yield (Table 1, samples 2 and 5).
However, the amount of the adsorbed deposit remained significant,
15 and 17% for OH and CO3 forms, respectively. In the subsequent
experiments, we used the temperature gradient: after the reaction
proceeding for 1 h at 60 °C, the mixture was rapidly cooled to
15 °C in an ice bath. This procedure led to the rapid exfoliation
of the surface deposit due to the difference in coefficients of thermal
expansion of the surface deposit and resin. The indium content in
the resin phase decreased to 2–3%, and the product yield increased
up to 95 and 87% (Table 1, samples 3 and 6).

The optimum reaction conditions providing
up to 95% yield of indium
hydroxide were as follows: the strong base anion exchange resin in
OH or CO3 form, with the concentration of In2(SO4)3 solution being 0.25 M, processing time
being 1 h at a temperature of 60 °C, followed by cooling to 15
°C in the ice bath.

Characterization of the Products
The composition of
as-precipitated products obtained under the optimum reaction conditions
using the anion resin in CO3 form (named In-CO3) and OH form (named In-OH) was determined by elemental (atomic absorption
spectroscopy, EDX, CHNS/O analysis) and complex thermal analysis.
It is represented by the following formulas: In(OH)2.64(CO3)0.18 for the In-OH sample and In(OH)1.94(CO3)0.53 for the In-CO3 sample. The presence of carbonate ions in the In-OH sample can be
explained by the CO2 adsorption from air by both the anion
resin29 and the precipitate during the
drying procedure in the oven. In addition, hydroxide ions were detected
in the In-CO3 sample due to the hydrolysis of indium carbonate.

Figure 4 shows the
thermal behavior of the In-CO3 sample. The mass loss that
occurred up to 150 °C and an endothermic peak at 115 °C
on the DSC curve were mainly due to the removal of surface-adsorbed
water molecules. Another significant mass loss was noted in a range
from 200 °C to 300 °C. The following endothermic effect
has maximum at 236 °C. It corresponds to the release of carbon
dioxide and water due to the thermal conversion of indium hydroxide
carbonate to In2O3. An exothermal sharp peak
at 346 °C is likely to be attributed to the crystallization of
the final product. The thermal behavior of the In-OH sample is similar,
but carbon dioxide release is slightly lower. According to energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (Figure 5a,b), the composition of the surface deposit corresponds to
the crystals deposited on the vessel bottom. Sulfate is not detected
in the product. Since the analysis depth is up to 1.5 μm, which
is more than the surface deposit thickness, a small amount of sulfur
(0.4%) determined by X-ray spectroscopy could be attributed to sulfate
ions, which have been sorbed by the resin during the process.

mass spectrum of the released gases during heating

the elements in this area.

Figure 6 shows the
diffraction patterns of the In-CO3 and In-OH as-prepared
samples and of the samples after calcination at 400 °C. As can
be seen from curves 1 and 2, there are no clearly defined peaks, that
is, these samples are amorphous and cannot be associated with any
known In(OH)3 or InOOH peaks. These samples may be related
to an amorphous intermediate compound generated by anion exchange
precipitation. After calcination of In-CO3 and In-OH precursors
at 400 °C (samples In-OH-400 and In-CO3–400),
the diffraction peaks in both cases (curves 3 and 4) agreed well with
that of a body-centered cubic phase In2O3 (JCPDS
file no. 74-1990). No peaks evidencing other crystal phases have been
detected. The crystallite size, calculated using the Debye–Scherrer
equation for the four most intensive peaks, was 15.8 nm for the In-OH-400
sample and 14.3 nm for the In-CO3–400 sample. According
to the TEM data (Figure 7), the particle size of the In-CO3 sample was approximately
8–10 nm and of the In-OH sample was 10–12 nm, which
is close to the XRD data. In addition, the specific surface area was
measured using the BET model, being 73 and 62 m2/g for
In-CO3 and In-OH, respectively. Based on these data, the
particle sizes were calculated using the equation given in ref (31) amounting to 13 and 11
nm. The obtained values of the particle size were in good agreement
with the TEM data and with the calculated sizes from the XRD data.
These characteristics are similar to the results obtained by Latha
et al.32 by the thermal decomposition at
650 °C of indium(III) acetylacetonate with acacia gum and surfactants
cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium docecyl benzene
sulfonate (SDBS), but we do not use expensive and toxic reagents.
Lee et al.9 have obtained indium oxide
with a particle size of 10–15 nm by the chemical deposition
method. However, in our case, the control of the synthesis conditions
is easier, since it proceeds under stationary conditions at a constant
pH value and the precipitation product is not contaminated with ions
of the mother liquor.

Figure 7 TEM micrographs
and histograms of the particle size distribution
of the In2O3, samples obtained for (a) In-CO3 and (b) In-OH.

Thus, the types of the
resin counterions (OH– or CO32–) had no significant effect
on the particle size of the produced indium oxide. The samples obtained
using the resin consist of nanoscale particles, have a large specific
surface area, and show high reaction activity. It is could be explained
by additional gas (carbon dioxide) emission during the synthesis (reaction
2) and further heat treatment of the product (Figure 4) that produces more porous structures.

Conclusions
In the present study, the process of anion resin
exchange precipitation
of indium(III) hydroxide by using the electrical conductivity measurement
method, SEM, X-ray microanalysis, and chemical analysis was thoroughly
studied. Based on the obtained data, the mechanism of the process,
proceeding through the stages of anion exchange between the anions
of indium solution and the resin, the precipitation of indium hydroxide
on the surface of the resin beads, and the rate-limiting stage of
the surface deposit desorption with the formation of an individual
product phase, was proposed.

The optimum reaction conditions
providing the maximum product yield
were as follows: the strong base anion exchange resin in OH or CO3 form, with the concentration of In2(SO4)3 solution being 0.25 M, processing time being 1 h at
a temperature of 60 °C, followed by cooling to 15 °C in
the ice bath. According to TG-DSC and elemental analysis, in the presence
of the AV-17-8(OH) resin, the product with the molecular formula In(OH)2.64(CO3)0.18 was obtained, while in
the case of AV-17-8(CO3), the obtained product was In(OH)1.94(CO3)0.53.

In addition, the
as-prepared deposits after the heat treatment
at 400 °C were transformed to impurity-free monophase In2O3 powders with an average particle size of 10–15
nm and specific surface area of 62–73 m2 g–1. The obtained materials are promising as precursors for the preparation
of indium tin oxide; they can also be used in modern electronics.

Materials
and Methods
Indium nitrate In(NO3)3.4·5H2O, indium chloride InCl3·3H2O,
and indium sulfate In2(SO4)3·xH2O were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The strong
base anion exchange resin AB-17-8 with a polystyrenic gel matrix was
produced by “Azot” Corporation (Cherkassy, Ukraine)
in the chloride form with a bead size of 0.4–0.6 mm (Russian
GOST 20301-74). This resin has a gel matrix based on polystyrene cross-linked
with divinylbenzene and functional group quaternary ammonium (type
I). This resin is an analogue of Purolite A400/A300, Lewatit M-500,
Amberlite IRA 402/420, Dowex SBR-P/Maraton A, has a significantly
lower cost and is widely used in different separation, purification,
and decontamination processes in Russia. Preliminary tests23,24,33 of AV-17-8 showed trends similar
to A400/A300 resin. The conversion of resin to the hydroxyl or carbonate
form and the determination of its total exchange capacity, that is,
the total number of sites available for exchange, were carried out
according to the techniques described in our works.24,30 The total exchange capacity of the anion exchange resin in the hydroxide
form was 1.0 meq·g–1 and that in the carbonate
form was 0.7 meq·ml–1.

In typical experiments,
AV-17-8(CO3) or (OH) taken in
excess (150%) is added to 0.25 M solution of indium salt. The mixture
was stirred (200 rpm) at a temperature of 20–60 °C using
a magnetic stirrer for a specified time: from 15 min to 24 h. To remove
the anion exchange resin beads from the reaction products, a sieve
with round holes 0.1 mm in diameter was used and the precipitate was
centrifuged, washed with distilled water, and finally dried in air
at 80 °C to form a precursor. The resin was also washed with
distilled water and eluted three times with 1 M HNO3 (10
mL portions) while stirring for 1 h. All the aqueous samples (eluates,
stock solutions, dissolved precipitates) were analyzed for indium
using a PerkinElmer A Analyst 400 Atomic-Absorption spectrometer (USA).
The molar fraction of In3+ (χ, %) in each phase was
calculated using the formula  where neq is the
number of moles of In3+ in the phase (precipitate, anion
exchange resin, stock solution) and n0 is the number of moles In3+ in the solution at the initial
moment of time.

The specific electrical conductivity (SEC) of
the reaction solutions
was measured using a Multitest KSL-101 (Semikocompany, Novosibirsk,
Russia).

In2O3 samples were obtained by
heat treatment
of the precursors in a muffle furnace for 1 h at 400 °C.

The surface of the anion exchange resin beads during the precipitation
was investigated by SEM. Small portions of resin (less than 1% of
the total amount) were removed from the reaction vessel after a certain
time interval (15, 30, and 60 min and 24 h), washed with distilled
water, dried at 60 °C, and fixed on an aluminum plate 5 ×
7 × 0.3 mm using epoxy resin. Micrographs and elemental mapping
of the resin beads surface were performed using a TM-3000 desktop
scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) equipped with a BRUKER
XFlash 430 H X-ray analyzer.

The thermochemical analysis of
the precursors was conducted by
thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC, NETZSCH
STA449C) in a temperature range of 25–900 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1 in flowing air (30 mL min–1). The analysis of evolved gases during the sample
heating was carried out using a quadrupole mass spectrometer QMS 403
C Aëolos (NETZSCH).

Powder X-ray diffraction was carried
out using a Shimadzu XRD-7000S
diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα anode. The carbon content
in the samples was determined using the Flash EA 1112 instrument from
Thermo Fisher Scientific. Nitrogen adsorption was measured using an
ASAP 2420 instrument (Micromeritics) at T = 77.3
K. The specific surface area was calculated using the BET model. The
degassing of the samples was carried out in two stages: at 150 for
3 h and at 250 °C for 3 h under 0.5 to 800 mmHg pressure in a
degassing port. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried
out using a HT-7700 instrument (Hitachi, Japan) operating at an accelerating
voltage of 100 kV.
