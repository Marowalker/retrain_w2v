Density
functional theory calculations based on magnetic and energetic
stability criteria were performed to study a series of yttrium-doped
lithium neutral clusters. A relativistic approximation was employed
to properly describe the energy and multiplicity of the given clusters’
fundamental states. The interaction of the 4d-Y atomic orbitals with
the sp-Li states had an important role in the magnetic and energetic
behavior of the selected systems. The spin density was concentrated
over the yttrium atom regardless of the size of the cluster. Li7Y is a new stable superatom due to its enhanced magnetic properties.

1 Introduction
Metallic
clusters have been extensively researched both experimentally
and theoretically due to their chemical, physical, electrical, optical,
and magnetic properties. The study of clusters represents one of the
fields of greatest growth in nanostructured materials science.1−10 In recent years, the development of new clusters that mimic the
chemical behavior of elements has been explored. The Jellium model
predicts that certain electronic configurations confer greater stability
to metallic clusters11,12 and, in analogy with the nuclear
structure, the electronic levels are grouped into shells. This idea
has led to Khanna and collaborators to suggest the concept of superatoms:
metallic clusters that imitate the electronic and chemical behavior
of atoms with which they share the same number of valence electrons.13−17 Lithium clusters have been studied intensively18−33 by different experimental methods such as electronic spin resonance,34−36 laser-induced fluorescence,37 optical
resonance,38,39 and Raman spectroscopy.40−43 The structure identification of the clusters is difficult regardless
of the technique used, especially when exploring beyond very small
systems.44 At a computational level, the
study of lithium clusters within the density functional framework
and post Hartree–Fock methods has been carried out.45−52 An element that dopes a metal cluster leads to changes in its energy,
structural properties, and the chemical nature of the bond.53 Lithium clusters doped with boron,54−56 aluminum,57 magnesium,58 germanium,59 carbon,60 and tin have been investigated.61−63 Aluminum- and boron-doped lithium clusters exhibiting covalence
have also been reported64 and the study
of highly ionic clusters of formula E5Li7+ (E = C, Si, Ge, Sn, y Pb)65 has
been carried out. The interaction between lithium and copper has also
been analyzed through spectroscopic data from Russon and collaborators,
who determined that this chemical union results in a σ bond.66 Previous work predicted high magnetic moments
in a series of alkaline metal clusters doped with yttrium of formula
MnY, where M = Na, K, Rb, and Cs and n = 9–13. The stability of these systems was controlled
by the combination of the yttrium 4d orbitals with the sp states of
the alkaline metals. The YK12 and YRb12 clusters
were determined to be superatoms of the icosahedral structure that
mimic the atom of manganese.67 Currently,
various methodologies like the gradient embedded genetic algorithm68 and the Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics
(BOMD) have been suggested to explore the potential energy surface
(PES) for different types of systems.69 The advent of more accurate density functional theory methods such
as the auxiliary density functional theory (ADFT) allows carrying
out several hundred picosecond molecular dynamics using scarce computational
wherewithal. This approximation has been very successful in the search
for new alkaline and transition metal clusters.70 In a previous study, binary yttrium-alkali superatoms exhibiting
outstanding energetic and magnetic properties in large systems were
described.67 In this sense, it is interesting
to look for superatom-like properties in smaller systems. For this
reason, a study of the structural and energetic properties of yttrium-doped
lithium clusters (LinY, n = 1–8) was carried out in the present work. Minimal energy
states were chosen from Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics
trajectories considering an ambient temperature of 300 K,71 with different multiplicities of spin. The selected
structures were subjected to local optimizations with the zero-order
regular approximation.72 Parameters such
as atomization energy (AE), gain energy, highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy
gap, magnetic moment (μB), and exchange splitting
were calculated.

2 Results and Discussion
Several initial geometries were used based on previously reported
lithium clusters47 to obtain the low-lying
isomers of the LinY (n = 1–8) systems. Permitted spin multiplicities were considered
up to six, i.e., 1, 3, and 5 for clusters with an even number of electrons
and 2, 4, and 6 for odd-numbered electron systems, while the charge
remained at zero for every calculation. Born–Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics trajectories were recorded at 300 K for each cluster. The
BOMD simulation was 50 ps long, as shown in Figure 1. The linear and angular momenta was set
to zero and maintained during the BOMD trajectory to ensure Galilei
invariance.73 The average temperature was
controlled by Nosé–Hoover three chains thermostat.74 This approach has been reported to be adequate
for the study of alkali and transition metal clusters.75,76 Minima structures were extracted from each calculated trajectory
and subjected to geometry optimizations without symmetry constraints
within the DFT framework implemented in the ORCA code.77 Frequency analysis was carried out to verify
the optimized minima on the potential energy surface (PES). Here,
we report the structures and frequencies, relative energies without
the zero-point energy correction, and the next electronic and magnetic
properties: atomization energy, gain energy, HOMO–LUMO gap,
exchange splitting, and magnetic moment.

cluster. The dynamics was performed at a temperature of 300 K, with
a trajectory of 50 000 fs on the time scale. The average total
energy is shown on the Y-axis. In the graph, the
bidirectional arrow indicates the geometry of the minimum energy corresponding
to the MD step (27 500 fs).

2.1 Structures and Frequencies
The minimum
energy state structures for LinY clusters
are shown in Figures 2–5 (n = 1–8).
Lithium atoms are represented in pink while the yttrium is colored
in yellow. The structures of the fundamental state of each cluster
are represented on the left side of each figure. The relative energy
of the third isomer of each family is found in the first table of
the Supporting Information. The ground
state structure of the LiY cluster is a linear structure with a triplet
potential energy surface (PES). As can be seen in Table 1, the Li–Y bond length
is 3.106 Å, this distance is 0.433 Å greater than the reported
experimental bond length for the Li2 dimer78,79 and 0.415 Å greater than the theoretical bond length of the
same dimer calculated at a DFT/SVWN level.80 The atomic radius reported in the literature for lithium is 1.67
Å, while for the atom of yttrium it is 2.12 Å,81 so that the sum of the atomic radius for the
Li2 dimer is 3.34 Å and the LiY system is 3.79 Å,
compared to the bond distances presented, the Li–Y bond is
weaker than that of the Li–Li bond. It was found that the energy
needed to break the Li–Li bond is 0.86 eV, while to break the
Li–Y bond is 0.57 eV. The next minimum of the cluster is found
with a singlet PES with an energy of 0.088 eV greater than the ground
state (Table 2). The
third minimum corresponds to a quintet multiplicity with a stability
of 0.908 eV (Table S2) greater than the
triplet state on the potential energy surface.

The three most stable isomers found for the
Li2Y cluster
have a molecular geometry of an isosceles triangle. The ground state
structure is located on the doublet PES. The experimental bond lengths
reported for a pure cluster of three lithium atoms correspond to an
isosceles triangle structure with two sides of 3.200 Å and the
remaining side of 2.730 Å, while the theoretical bond lengths
are 3.209 and 2.741 Å, respectively.80 The bond lengths obtained for the Li2Y cluster are 0.083
and 0.112 Å greater than the experimental bond lengths and 0.074
and 0.101 Å greater than the theoretical bond lengths reported
for the Li3 cluster. The following higher energy isomers
were found on the potential energy surface at a multiplicity of 4
and 6 with relative energies of 0.079 and 1.264 eV, respectively.
The minima structures found for the Li3Y clusters are depicted
in the first row of Figure 3. The ground state isomer is found with a spin multiplicity
of three. The geometry of the system corresponds to a tetrahedron.
The next lowest energy isomer of Li3Y is characterized
by quintet multiplicity conserving its tetrahedral geometry with the
energy of 0.301 eV greater than the ground state. Next, the singlet
state isomer is structured like a rhombus, differing from its lower
energy counterparts. It has a relative energy of 0.349 eV. Previous
theoretical works determined that the Li4 cluster has a
rhombic molecular geometry.49,80,81 This means that the yttrium atom heavily influences the geometry
adopted by the metal cluster, such that the two lower energy structures
are arranged like a tetrahedron. The results for the Li4Y cluster showed that the most stable isomer is found on the doublet
PES with a trigonal bipyramid geometry with bond lengths of 2.776
(1–4), 3.179 (4–5), 3.174 (1–5), 2.957 (1–2),
2.956 (1–3), 2.956 (1–3), 2.957 (4–3), 3.234
(5–2), 3.234 (5–2), 3.233 (5–3), and 2.958 (4–2)
Å. These bond lengths can be seen along the calculated ones for
the Li5 cluster in Table 1.80,82,83 The 1–4, 4–5, 1–5, 1–2, 1–3,
2–5, and 3–5 bonds are longer for the yttrium-doped
molecule, whereas the 3–4 and 2–4 bonds become shorter.
The second least calculated energy isomer is found with a spin multiplicity
of four with the energy of 0.279 eV greater than the ground state
isomer (Table 2), while
the highest energy isomer is located on the sextuplet potential energy
surface with a relative energy of 0.517 eV (Table S2). Both isomers also shared the trigonal bipyramid structure
of the ground state.

Multiplicities
of spin are labeled as m under each structure. The
bond lengths are in angstrom units.

Once again, for the Li5Y cluster there are geometry
variations between multiplicity states. The singlet multiplicity structure
is a rhomboidal bipyramid while the clusters of spin multiplicity
of three and five have a triangular bipyramid structure with an adjacent
lithium atom, completing a third triangular pyramid (Figure 4). Alexandrova and co-workers
(2005)84 found a minimum of Li6 with molecular geometry of rhomboidal bipyramid geometry using genetic
algorithms and using CCSD (T)/6-311+G* to refine the molecular structure,
similarly Brito and collaborators (2014)80 found a minimum for a Li6 cluster at a DFT/SVWN level
with the same molecular geometry. The relative energies for the clusters
with spin multiplicities of three and five were 0.196 and 0.454 eV,
respectively (Table 2 and Table S2).

Figure 4 Geometries of the minimum
energy states for LinY clusters when n = 5–6. Multiplicities
of spin are labeled as m under each structure. The
bond lengths are in angstrom units.

The most stable isomers found for the Li6Y clusters
are represented in the second row of Figure 4. The lowest energy isomer is found on the
doublet potential energy surface with bond lengths of 3.002 (1–2),
3.216 (6–3), and 3.286 (6–5) Å. These bond lengths
are 0.024 (1–2), 0.345 (6–3), and 0.588 (6–5)
Å greater than the theoretical lengths reported for Li7.80 The molecular geometry of this system
corresponds to a pentagonal bipyramid, this geometry has been previously
reported for a pure Li7 cluster.49,80,84 Shao and collaborators in 201285 reported a lithium cluster of six atoms doped
with a copper atom in which the resulting isomers corresponded to
a pentagonal bipyramid geometry. Unlike the structure discussed in
the present work, the doping atom is part of one of the vertices of
the pentagon in the bipyramidal system. The next highest energy isomer
is found with a spin multiplicity of four and with 0.233 eV greater
than the ground state structure and the highest energy isomer is found
with a spin multiplicity of six with a relative energy of 0.814 eV
(Table S2).

The isomers found for
the Li7Y clusters are depicted
in the first row of Figure 5. The structures of the three isomers explored
are very similar; they have a molecular geometry of a pentagonal bipyramid
with an adjacent lithium atom. The ground state is found with five
spin multiplicity and the following isomers are found with a spin
multiplicity of one with a relative energy of 0.125 eV and the last
for a spin multiplicity of three with a relative energy of 0.431 eV.

Figure 5 Geometries
of the minimum energy states for LinY
clusters when n = 7–8. Multiplicities
of spin are labeled as m under each structure. The
bond lengths are in angstrom units.

The results for the Li8Y clusters are shown in
the last
row of Figure 5. Molecular
structures have an icosahedral tendency. There are reports for yttrium-doped
alkaline metal clusters of general formula MnY (M = Na, K, Rb, and Cs) where the same trend is observed.67 The isomers have a similar molecular structure,
the state of minimal energy is found on the doublet potential energy
surface. The second most stable isomer is found with a spin multiplicity
of four with a relative energy of 0.106 eV and the isomer with the
least energetic stability is found with a spin multiplicity of six
with a relative energy of 0.720 eV.

In general, several metal
clusters that have been studied present
a semi-icosahedral structure (Li6Y, Li7Y, and
Li8Y). Quantum confinement in clusters can conduct to the
grouping of electronic states into shells, and electronic orbitals
disperse over multiple atoms, producing geometric effects.86 Another important aspect to consider is that
in the geometrical optimizations carried out on the metal clusters
of this work, it is observed that the atom of yttrium tends not to
surround itself with lithium atoms; it occupies the position of the
vertices of the structures. This leads to infer that the Li–Li
interactions are favored over Li–Y. It was found that the energy
needed to break the Li–Li bond is 0.86 eV, while to break the
Li–Y bond is 0.57 eV. In this sense, less energy is needed
to dissociate the Li–Y bond compared to the Li–Li bond.
On the other hand, the sum of the atomic radius of Li–Li is
3.04 Å and of Li and yttrium is 3.92 Å, so it is corroborated
again that the Li–Li bond is mostly favored. Meanwhile, in Table 3, the calculated harmonic
vibrational frequencies are shown for each of the yttrium-doped lithium
clusters. All the resulting values are positive, indicative of minimum
energy states. Vibration modes were calculated using the zero-order
regular approach.72 For the yttrium atom,
it is important to include these relativistic effects since ZORA considers
phenomena such as spin–orbit coupling.87 The vibrational frequency has been experimentally reported for the
lithium dimer at 351.4 cm–1. Computational calculations
predict it at 341 cm–1 with the B3LYP hybrid functional
and 329.8 cm–1 with the PW91 functional.85 In contrast, the present study found a shift
to a band of 242 cm–1 for the LiY system. The vibration
modes for the Li5 cluster have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311+G*
and at CCSD (T)/6-311+G*, obtaining values of 348 and 329 cm–1, respectively.84 In turn, a characteristic
band of 362.2 cm–1 was found for the Li4Y cluster, as shown in Table 3. The Li6 system presented bands at 352 and 326
cm–1, calculated under the B3LYP/6-311+G* and at
CCSD (T)/6-311+G* methods.83 These results
are similar to the band found for the Li5Y cluster at 326
cm–1.

2.2 Energy Properties
With the purpose
of analyzing the energetic stability of LinY, n = 1–8 clusters, the atomization energy
(AE) was calculated. This represents the energy needed to break-up
the cluster into its atomic components  here, nE(Li), E(Y), and E(LinY) are
the total energies of the lithium and yttrium atoms and of the LinY cluster, respectively. The energy gained by
the addition of a lithium atom to the preceding cluster of formula
Lin–1Y was calculated as  Table 4 shows calculated
values of ΔEgain and AE. Note that
large atomization energy values along
with low ΔEgain values can be associated
with molecular stability. These criteria single out the Li3Y and Li7Y systems—which tends towards an icosahedral
structure—as stable clusters.

Subsequently, the magnetic robustness
of the clusters was analyzed
by calculating the relative energy between the calculated ground state
and the next low-lying isomer. Li3Y presents the largest
relative energy among the series at 0.301 eV, as shown in Figure 6. In this sense,
the Li3Y system presented large energetic stability to
the change of spin multiplicity. This makes it a system of interest
for further studies. For example, Khanna’s group in Virginia
Commonwealth University (VCU) has worked on the research of magnetic
superatoms’ assemblies could be ideal for molecular electronic
devices.9

Figure 6 Variation of the relative energy (Erel) and the energy gain (ΔEgain)
of yttrium-doped lithium clusters, LinY n = 2–8. The blue strip represents the
cluster where the maximum value of relative energy is found.

It is known that the HOMO–LUMO
gap is a useful criterion
to determine the stability of small clusters. Table 4 presents that the system that has the highest
HOMO–LUMO gap with a value of 0.810 eV corresponds to the structure
of Li4Y. This system’s spin electromers share a
similar molecular geometry with a magnetic moment of 1 μB for the lowest energy isomer. In the case of systems with
a greater number of atoms, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap was 0.715,
0.446, 0.474, and 0.451 eV for Li5Y, Li6Y, Li7Y, and Li8Y, respectively. There are theoretical
studies of pure lithium clusters from five to twenty atoms, where
the reported values for the HOMO–LUMO gap are 0.81–1.36
eV for the Li8 system and 0.23–0.50 eV for Li9.88

2.3 Magnetic
Robustness and Exchange Splitting
An important parameter
indicates the increase in the magnetic moment
if the cluster is to obtain high values of exchange splitting from
the external levels. Therefore, in LinY structures, the exchange splitting of the one-dimensional (1D)
orbitals is calculated, as the difference of the energies of the orbitals
with the highest occupied energy α and β. Figure 7 depicts the variation of the
exchange splitting with respect to the size of the LinY cluster and Figure 8 shows the variation of exchange splitting and magnetic
moment versus the size of the LinY cluster.
As can be seen, the Li7Y system has the highest exchange
splitting with a value of 0.3571 eV and a magnetic moment of 4 μB. Clearly, there is a correlation between the magnetic moment
and the exchange splitting, the higher values of each parameter are
corresponding, the higher the magnetic moment the higher the exchange
splitting.

Figure 7 Variation in exchange splitting with respect to the number of lithium
atoms in LinY clusters, n = 1–8. The exchange splitting of the Y atom is given as ref (67).

Figure 8 Exchange splitting and variation of the magnetic moments of spin
(μB) of yttrium-doped lithium clusters, LinY n = 2–8. The blue
strip represents the cluster where the maximum value of exchange splitting
and magnetic moment is found.

In the literature there are reports on the effect of transition
metal doping on alkaline clusters, Guo and co-workers, 2014,89 found an exchange splitting of 0.5 eV in a Na8Y system. González-Ramírez and co-workers, 2013,67 found maximum exchange splitting values compared
to exchange splitting values of the yttrium atom in yttrium-doped
alkaline potassium and rubidium metal clusters with an icosahedral
structure. Values calculated for the Na8Y system from density
functional theory at a PW91/ZORA/TZP level report a magnetic moment
value of 1 μB.89 On the
other hand, for example, a cluster with another transition metal,
Na7Ti, was found to have a magnetic momentum value of 3
μB90 and in other systems
such as the same number of atoms as Li7Y, values of 3 μB were obtained.2 The Li7Y cluster is reported as the system with the highest magnetic yield
has a magnetic moment 4 times greater than an yttrium atom.

2.4 Molecular Orbital Description
The
electronic energy levels and the angular momentum of the superatomic
molecular orbitals were analyzed. Starting with the LiY cluster that
has four valence electrons, two of these in a S super quantum state
and the remaining in a P state and the other in a Dα state, such that the superorbital configuration is 1S21Pα11Dα1.
The next cluster is Li2Y with a superorbital configuration
of 1S21Dα11P2, it
is important to highlight that it is unique that the D super quantum
state is less energetic that the P super quant state. The Li3Y has a fill of six valence electrons, three of them of lithium and
other three of yttrium, the superorbital configuration is 1S21Pα31Pβ1. It is important to note that it
has the same number of valence electrons as the chalcogen group in
the periodic table. The cluster has a value of 0.076 eV and a magnetic
moment of 2 μB (Figure 9). The Li4Y cluster possesses
seven valence electrons, two of these fill the 1S2 and
five the 1P5 superorbitals. This cluster presents an exchange
splitting of 0.010 eV and a magnetic moment of 1 μB. Li5Y is the unique closed shell species with a 1S21P6 configuration with zero magnetic moment and
without exchange splitting, i.e., 1Pα and 1Pβ orbitals have the same energy. The Li6Y
cluster with a superorbital configuration of 1S21P61Dα1 presents a magnetic moment
of 1 μB with an exchange splitting of 0.269 eV. The next cluster
under analysis is Li7Y (Figure 10) with a superorbital configuration of 1S21Pα31Pβ21Dα3, in other words it has 10 valence
electrons with a magnetic moment of 4 μB. The 1D
states have a contribution of roughly 30% from the atomic orbital
4d-Y. These reports have previously been identified as the origin
of the magnetism of similar clusters.67 The fact that this system is found on the quintet PES decreases
the d-Y and sp-Li overlap, stabilizing the 1P orbitals and increases
the exchange splitting, promoting higher magnetic states. The last
metallic cluster analyzed Li8Y presents an orbital configuration
of 1S21P61Dα21Dβ1, 11 valence electrons with a magnetic moment
that decreases 3μB, so the magnetic moment of this
system is low. In all cases, the spin density was concentrated over
the yttrium atom (Figure 11).

Figure 9 One-electron energy levels and molecular orbital charge density
isosurfaces in the Li3Y cluster (isovalue 0.008 C/m3). The majority and minority levels are shown. Continuous
lines correspond to the filled levels and the dotted lines correspond
to the unfilled states.

3 Conclusions
First principle calculations
including Born–Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics were employed to predict several yttrium-doped
lithium clusters based on established energetic and magnetic principles
of stability. The stabilities of the clusters are governed by the
electronic configurations. These clusters presented an orbital combination
of the 4d-Y levels with the sp-Li states, which enhances the systems’
exchange splitting. This is determined for the position of the delocalized
orbitals presented on the clusters. The Li7Y cluster stands
out with a magnetic moment of 4 μB, which is 4 times
more than a single Y atom. This unusually high magnetic moment is
the product of the presence of the most stable isomer on the quintuplet’s
potential energy surface and the delocalized superorbitals it presents.

4 Computational Details
Born–Oppenheimer molecular
dynamics calculations were carried
out using ADFT as implemented in the deMon2k package.90−95 For the exchange and correlation functional, the PW86 functional
was employed.96 The exchange–correlation
potential was numerically integrated on a fixed fine grid.97 A variational fitting procedure was used to
estimate the Coulomb energy.98,99 The DZVP basis set
was employed for the lithium species while the yttrium atom was described
using a relativistic model core potential.100,101 The GEN-A2* auxiliary function set was utilized for all calculations.102 Geometry optimizations were effected by the
ORCA software103 using the exchange–correlation
functional proposed by Becke and Perdew (BP86).104 This functional helps to obtain accuracy in the geometry
of metallic and organometallic systems.105 The def2-TZVP basis set was used to describe all electrons in the
system.106,107 The ZORA approximation was employed to include the
scalar relativistic effects.108 The electronic and magnetic properties for the final
structures were calculated under the same parameters.

The figures
concerning the systems under study were obtained with
the molecular visualizer Chemcraft.109 Cartesian
coordinates (Å) of the LinY, n = 1–8 clusters are given in the Supporting Information.
