Printing conducting
copper interconnections on plastic substrates is of growing interest
in the field of printed electronics. Photonic curing of copper inks
with intense pulsed light (IPL) is a promising process as it is very
fast and thus can be incorporated in roll-to-roll production. We report
on using IPL for obtaining conductive patterns from inks composed
of submicron particles of copper formate, a copper precursor that
has a self-reduction property. Decomposition of copper formate can
be performed by IPL and is affected both by the mode of energy application
and the properties of the printed precursor layer. The energy application
mode was controlled by altering three pulse parameters: duration,
intensity, and repetitions at 1 Hz. As the decomposition results from
energy transfer via light absorption, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were
added to the ink to increase the absorbance. We show that there is
a strict set of IPL parameters necessary to obtain conductive copper
patterns. Finally, we show that by adding as little as 0.5 wt % single-wall
CNTs to the ink the absorptance was enhanced by about 50% and the
threshold energy required to obtain a conductive pattern decreased
by ∼25%. These results have major implications for tailoring
inks intended for IPL processing.

1 Introduction
Printing
electrical conductive interconnections is a key component
in the field of printed electronics. Conducting components are usually
printed, followed by a post-printing step that usually involves heating
to sinter or decompose the printed conducting element. In the past
few years, several new approaches for post-treatment of conductive
inks have been reported, including methods such as photonic curing,
plasma exposure, and laser selective sintering. Each method has advantages;
for instance, laser selective sintering enables direct local reduction
and sintering1,2 to form very fine electrical wiring
without the need for a conventional printing step, or it can be used
to form flexible transparent films by welding copper nanowires.3−5 In comparison, photonic curing is a rapid and scalable process that
can be used to treat large surface areas simultaneously. The main
advantage of the latter method is that only printed patterns are affected;
thus, there is no wastage of material compared to that in laser sintering
in which the unsintered material is washed away.

Photonic curing
employs intense pulsed light (IPL), which is much
faster than traditional thermal heating and laser selective sintering,
and therefore is suitable for roll-to-roll (R2R) processes with plastic
substrates. In the IPL method, a xenon lamp
irradiates a wide area at once, using a short and powerful light pulse
in the UV–vis–IR range. The IPL method causes rapid
heating of a thin layer of material, which is exposed to the light
pulse.6 As only the exposed surface is
heated, the bulk of the substrate on which the sample is printed remains
unaffected. Shortly after the pulse is applied, the heat from the
affected thin surface dissipates into the thicker substrate layer,
resulting in fast cooling of the printed layer. The local heating
can induce sintering of metal nanoparticle (NP) inks3,7−10 or thermal decomposition of copper precursor inks. This enables
the use of IPL for obtaining conductive patterns. Copper precursor
inks include two types of inks: those with inorganic precursors11−13 that contain a reducer, and metal-organic decomposition (MOD) inks14,15 that in most cases do not require addition of a reducer. IPL can
be used for decomposition of copper precursors without the problems
associated with conventional oven heating (e.g., without the need
for a nitrogen environment to prevent copper oxidation).9

Typical MOD inks contain a low concentration
of copper; therefore,
their utilization in printed electronics is limited to printed conductors
with little copper content. Previously reported MOD inks contain metal
complexes that are dissolved in a solvent and usually have a low metal
loading (ca. 10–15 wt %). This limits their printing efficiency
to obtaining conductive patterns with high metal content and thus
they may require multiple printing stages and excessive removal of
solvents after each printing stage.

We have developed a new ink that is composed of submicron particles
of copper formate with a high metal loading16 that is stable to oxidation and is prepared by a very simple method
that is common in the conventional printing industry. Unlike the reported
MOD inks, this new ink is composed of a dispersion of copper salt
particles. This new ink actually has the advantages of the present
reported approaches without their inherent disadvantages: copper NP
inks with high metal load, which suffer from oxidation, and oxidation-stable
MOD inks, which suffer from low metal load. Upon decomposition of
this copper salt, the Cu2+ ion is self-reduced to a conducting
Cu0 form. Thus, unlike that
for other particle-based precursor inks12,13 to produce
copper patterns, there is no need to add reducing agents to the ink
formulation.

Decomposition of the salt precursor ink with photonic
curing as
done in this study occurs in two steps.15 First, the copper salt absorbs light (in the 600–800 nm range),
causing the excitation of electrons and local heating. Afterward,
the rise in energy is sufficient to enable the decomposition of the
copper formate to copper, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen, along with
a reduction of the copper ion to pure copper by the formate counter
ion. The general decomposition17 reaction
is presented as reaction 1 and the separate redox reactions18 as reactions 2 and 3. 1   2   3  One of the main disadvantages of photonic
curing is the high energy consumption to generate the intense light
pulses. Araki15 et al. suggested that the most important factor
in photonic curing is the absorbance properties of the ink. To enhance
light absorbance and energy absorbance of copper formate patterns
during photonic curing, we prepared a hybrid ink that contains copper
formate particles and a very efficient light absorber. The latter
material is carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which is known as the blackest
material19 with excellent light absorption,20 electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity.
CNTs have been shown to have excellent solar–thermal conversion21−23 and solar–thermal heating.24 For
example,24 thin films of CNTs have been
used to harvest and convert almost the entire incident solar light
into heat for water heating and evaporation. As the emission spectrum
from a xenon lamp is similar to the solar emission spectrum, it is
reasonable to assume that the incident light from IPL will also be
efficiently converted into heat by the CNTs. The generated heat can
be evenly conducted along the CNT and can be transferred via direct
contact to the surrounding copper formate particles, leading to their
heating and decomposition.

In general, the available information
concerning the use of IPL
for decomposition of MOD inks is far from being systematic. There
is no data on the effect of different pulse parameters on the electrical
resistance and morphology of the obtained patterns, nor are there
any examples for a practical approach to find the optimal IPL parameters
for the decomposition of a MOD ink. Furthermore, the effect of enhancement
of photoabsorption by addition of single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs) has not
been reported before, and to our opinion, this will open an effective
way to improve photonic curing processes.

In the present study,
we used a PulseForge 1200 (NovaCentrix) system
to show that copper formate-based inks can indeed enable printing
conductive patterns without a need for reducing agents and inert atmosphere
using the IPL process. Furthermore, we found that hybrid inks composed
of both copper precursors and low concentration of CNTs enable a significant
improvement in conductance due to more efficient light absorption.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Investigating Pulse Parameters
The
IPL system enables control of the pulse parameters, including duration
and intensity. Each parameters’ combination affects the energy
flux profile and therefore affects the decomposition kinetics and
the morphology of the obtained copper pattern. Figure 1 presents the visual outcome of typical experiments,
in which a blue pattern is obtained by screen printing of the copper
formate particle ink (resulting in a 13 ± 1 μm line height
after drying, Figure 1A), and upon light irradiation, the blue color changes into a shiny
reddish color, which is typical for copper metal (Figure 1B). Decomposition with IPL
was performed in an air environment, and the copper ion was reduced
by the formate (the reducing counter ion in the copper formate salt)
to Cu0. During decomposition, some soot is formed, and
it can be seen as the shadow around the copper patterns. Qualitatively,
the amount of soot formed is proportional to the pulse intensity and
can be easily wiped away.

to decomposition.
(B) Copper pattern obtained after decomposition with IPL (pulse parameters:
two pulses, 240 V, 10 ms).

A methodical examination of the effect of pulse parameters
on the
decomposition of the copper formate particle ink was carried out by
altering three key pulse parameters: the pulse duration in milliseconds
(from 2 to 10 ms with 2 ms intervals), pulse intensity (controlled
by the applied voltage to the xenon lamp from 180 to 450 V or less
with 20 V intervals), and number of pulse repetitions at a frequency
of 1 Hz (one to four repeats). To understand the effect of the different
IPL parameter combinations on the decomposition of copper formate
patterns, a screening experiment was performed with small segments
of the pattern. The segments were methodically treated with different
IPL parameter combinations followed by resistance measurements. Figure S1 presents a typical sample used for
the screening experiment; all segments in the sample were treated
with two pulses with a duration of 10 ms and varying intensity. At
a voltage of 180 V, the layer was unaffected; at 200 V, only partial
decomposition was achieved; and at 220 V or higher, a copper pattern
was obtained. The penetration depth depends on the pulse parameters
and the thickness of the printed layer. In the samples in which there
was only partial decomposition, we observed a layer of copper above
a layer of copper formate. This shows that the energy applied was
sufficient to decompose only the top layer but was not sufficient
to penetrate to the lower part of the copper formate layer. The samples
that were treated with pulse parameters that lead to full decomposition
were found to contain pure face-centered cubic (FCC) copper throughout
the whole layer, indicating that the light either penetrated fully
or local heating of the upper layer caused the decomposition of lower
layers.

The substrate, Kapton, has a visible orange color and
absorbs light
well in the 300–500 nm range. However, the contribution of
the substrate light absorption to the decomposition of the samples
is insignificant. This can be seen by visual inspection of the said
partially decomposed samples; if sufficient heat had been transferred
from the substrate to the copper formate to induce decomposition,
we would have seen samples with decomposition adjacent to the substrate.
In practice, in all samples that were only partially decomposed, it
was visible that there was a layer of copper above the layer of copper
formate. Furthermore, initial experiments with samples on a transparent
polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) substrate had similar results in terms
of minimal pulse parameters needed to induce decomposition. Thus,
it was evident that the energy needed for decomposition was obtained
directly from the light pulse to the printed copper formate layer
and not via substrate heating.

Figure 2A,B presents
two 3D graphs showing the conductance obtained with different pulse
parameters in the screening experiment. Only very specific combinations
resulted in a conducting copper pattern. Figure 2A, which plots the conductance obtained from
various pulse combinations with a single pulse, shows that a single
pulse does not lead to conductive samples, except for one combination
(240 V, 10 ms) that results in low conductance. A comparison between
the conductance obtained by one pulse and that obtained by two pulses
(Figure 2B) shows that
in general higher conductance is obtained with two pulses. Conductive
samples were obtained only by treatment with more than one pulse,
in which each pulse was formed at a voltage range of 220–260
V and with a pulse duration above 6 ms. The best conductance, 0.244
S (line length: 2.5 mm), was measured for two pulses at 240 V and
10 ms duration. From these results, it is clear that the patterns
composed of copper formate particles can indeed be converted into
conductive patterns by the IPL exposure (the 3D graphs for three and
four pulses were comparable to the graph for two pulses, as presented
in Figure S2). Furthermore, for the combinations
of low pulse intensity and low pulse duration, the photonic curing
did not lead to decomposition or led only to partial decomposition
of the copper formate layer. High-voltage pulse combinations led to
the release of a substantial amount of soot, resulting in a black
sediment around the copper pattern. Therefore, even though decomposition
of the copper formate occurred, the samples were not conductive.

Figure 2 (A, B)

in the screening experiment for all pulse voltage and duration combinations:
(A) 3D plot of the combinations with one pulse and (B) 3D plot of
the combinations with two pulses. (C) Conductance of the samples prepared
with two pulses as a function of the total energy applied. The intensity
and duration of the pulses for each data point are indicated.

It could be assumed that the governing
parameter in obtaining conductivity
is the amount of energy that is supplied to cause copper formate decomposition.
Therefore, the energy supplied by the IPL process under the various
parameters for a single pulse was measured by a bolometer. Surprisingly,
it was found that there was no straightforward correlation between
the supplied energy and the obtained conductance. Figure 2C presents the data from the
screening experiment from a different point of view, by examining
the conductance of the samples prepared with two pulses as a function
of the applied energy. All conductive samples were those that were
treated with long pulses (6–10 ms), whereas shorter pulses
did not result in a conducting sample, even in the cases in which
the total energy was higher than that of the long pulses. This finding
was also observed for three and four pulses. Therefore, we conclude
that while using IPL for the decomposition of copper formate, the
way in which the energy is applied is more important than its net
total value. The duration of the pulse is a critical parameter; longer
pulses can lead to better results. This conclusion is similar to the
observation by Niittynen7 regarding the IPL treatment of copper NPs. Thus,
the way in which the energy is applied is important in both a system
that requires mainly sintering (of the copper NPs) and, as we show,
a system that requires decomposition of a precursor.

After finding
the best pulse parameters to obtain conductance (two
pulses, 240 V, 10 ms), an additional experiment was conducted for
a larger-area pattern, 1.3 × 22 mm2, in which the
conductance was 0.039 ± 0.007 S. Figure 3A presents a scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of the sample showing an “island” morphology
of the pattern. An energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) line scan (Figure 3B), with the prevalent
atoms displayed along the yellow line in Figure 3A, shows that the islands are mainly composed
of copper, whereas the areas between the islands contain mainly carbon
and oxygen. It should be noted that as the sampling depth of the EDX
is over 0.5 μm it is possible that the detected carbon and oxygen
originate from the underlying Kapton substrate and not from copper
formate or copper. Because of the nonhomogeneous copper morphology,
we were unable to calculate the conductivity of the samples.

Figure 3 (A) SEM image
of a sample prepared with two 240 V, 10 ms pulses.
An EDX line scan was performed on the sample; the scanned line is
marked by the thick yellow line, and the result is plotted above the
yellow line and enlarged in the EDX line scan (B) showing the locations
of copper, oxygen, and carbon along the yellow line in (A).

A closer look at the film morphology
was taken with the cross-sectional
images obtained by focused ion beam (FIB). Figure 4A shows the top view of the sample, and Figure 4B,C presents the
cross-sectional images at various magnifications of the sample prepared
with two pulses (240 V, 10 ms). The most interesting feature is that
there are elongated voids inside the copper layer. Most probably,
these voids result from the release of gases during the decomposition
of copper formate (see reaction 1). It should be noted that a “pop” sound can
be heard during the IPL process, which is due to either the instantaneous
release of gases during decomposition or the bursting of the voids.
In addition, when the light interacts with the top layer of the printed
pattern, it is possible that the upper layer decomposes first to form
a copper film, and when the lower layer decomposes, the released gas
is captured under the previously formed copper film, thus forming
the voids. These voids probably also negatively affect the adhesion
of the metal to the substrate, and this should be further improved.
These findings support Araki’s15 hypothesis that morphological defects are formed
due to the release of carbon dioxide gas during photonic curing of
various copper complexes.

two pulses of 240
V, 10 ms. (A) Top-view SEM image. (B, C) Cross-sectional images at
increasing magnifications, showing hollow “voids” inside
the copper layer. (D) Cross-sectional image of a sample treated with
1 pulse of 240 V, 10 ms.

Microscopic examination of the samples prepared in the screening
experiment can shed light on the role of each of the two pulses needed
to obtain a conductive line. From the cross-sectional images of the
samples prepared with a single pulse (Figure 4D) compared to those of a sample prepared
with two pulses (Figure 4C), it is evident that a single pulse causes the decomposing of the
copper salt, whereas the second pulse causes sintering and densification
of the formed copper particles (area marked by dotted squares). X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples obtained with one and
two pulses (pulse parameters: 10 ms, 240 V) indicate that in both
cases only crystalline copper is present; thus, it is possible to
conclude that the copper formate was fully decomposed by the first
pulse.

After the first pulse that decomposes the copper formate
to copper,
the optical properties of the pattern change. Copper NPs absorb light
in the 200–600 nm range;25 thus,
there is an overlap with the emission spectrum
from the IPL and copper particles; therefore, the IPL should also
contribute to sintering of the copper particles formed, as previously
reported.7,26

A theoretical calculation shows that
the decomposition of copper
formate into copper involves a ∼90% volume reduction; thus,
when considering the island morphology, the film thickness reduction
from 13 μm to about 2–4 μm is reasonable.

2.2 Hybrid Ink: Adding CNTs To Enhance Light Absorbance
and Conductance
To improve the conductance of the printed
patterns, we evaluated the possibility of increasing the light absorbance
and, consequently, the total absorbed energy. We prepared hybrid inks,
composed of copper formate particles, and CNTs, which are excellent
light absorbers. In preliminary experiments, we found that the absorptance
increases even at low concentrations of CNT. We present results from
inks that contain 0.5 solid wt % SWCNTs. The CNTs were added to the
copper formate powder and were well dispersed in the hybrid ink by
the ultrafine wet grinding process. This concentration of SWCNTs was
chosen as this was the highest that could be dispersed without significantly
altering the viscosity of the dispersion during the grinding and dispersing
stages, with the bead mill. We evaluated inks with a lower concentration
of SWCNTs and found that the photonic absorbance is linearly proportional
to the concentration of CNTs. Figure 5A presents single CNTs (or several in a bundle) on
the surface of a printed pattern of the hybrid ink before decomposition. Figure 5B presents CNTs found
in the cracks of the ink layer that were formed during preparation
of the sample for SEM. The light absorption spectra of the inks (with
and without CNTs) are presented in Figure 5C, along with the normalized emission spectrum
of a single light pulse. As it can be seen, addition of 0.5 wt % CNTs
(red line) enhances the light absorbance, especially in the 400–550
nm range, where the IPL is at its maximal light emission (olive green
line) and the copper formate is at its lowest light absorption (black
line). The absorptance in the main pulse emission range (300–700
nm) was calculated from the UV–vis reflectance spectra15 to be 47.9 and 71.7% for the regular ink and
hybrid ink, respectively. Thus, for wavelengths with strong emission
from the IPL, the absorptance was enhanced by about 50% with the addition
of as little as 0.5% SWCNTs. These results show that adding CNTs to
the copper formate ink enables the utilization of a larger portion
of the wavelengths emitted from the IPL, including the wavelengths
that are not absorbed by copper formate.

hybrid ink before decomposition. Single CNTs
(or several in a bundle) are spotted on the surface of the printed
layer. The particles around the CNTs are copper formate particles.
(B) CNTs found in the cracks of the ink layer that were formed during
preparation of the sample for SEM. (C) Light absorption spectra of
the inks with and without CNTs, along with the normalized emission
spectrum of a single light pulse.

A screening experiment, similar to the one presented in Figure 2A,B, was performed
to compare the conductance values of the regular ink and hybrid ink
after IPL irradiation
with two pulses. According to the initial screening experiment, longer
pulses resulted in better conductance; therefore, this screening experiment
was conducted with a wider range of pulse durations, up to 14 ms.
The 3D graphs are shown in the supplementary data (Figure S3A,B). The lowest energy supplied to the sample that
resulted in partial decomposition was lower for samples with the hybrid
ink than for those with the regular ink; this is to be expected because
of the better light absorption. As with the regular ink, partial decomposition
of samples with the hybrid ink was observed as a thin layer of copper
above a layer of copper formate; thus, the energy applied was sufficient
to decompose the top layer, but again, it was not sufficient to penetrate
to the lower part of the layer of copper formate with SWCNTs. Samples
that were treated with the pulse parameters that lead to full decomposition
were found by XRD to contain pure FCC copper without copper formate
or copper oxides.

The optimal pulse settings to obtain conducting
patterns for the
two inks were different: For the regular ink, the best conductance
for pulses with a duration of up to 12 ms was obtained with a voltage
of 240 V and for longer pulses it was obtained with 220 V. For the
hybrid ink, the best conductance was observed at 220 V for all pulse
durations. Overall, by the preliminary screening experiment, it appears
that the hybrid ink enabled obtaining printed patterns with a higher
conductance than that obtained with the regular ink. After narrowing
down the intensity parameters to 220 and 240 V (two flashes), we evaluated
the samples with larger printed lines (22 × 1.3 mm2 lines) under various pulse durations, from 2 to 20 ms with 2 ms
intervals. For samples prepared at 220 V, the hybrid ink resulted
in better electrical performance than that of the regular ink, whereas
at 240 V, no significant difference was measured. In both sets of
experiments, the samples with the hybrid ink required a lower energy
threshold to obtain conductive patterns compared to that for those with
the regular ink. Figure S3C,D presents
the conductance for the samples prepared at 220 and 240 V.

Figure 6 presents
the logos of the two research institutes printed on PEN, showing that
the ILP process is also suitable for large coverage patterns and for
printing on other substrates. Figure 7 presents the average electrical conductance of large
samples at 220 V, showing the significantly better results of the
hybrid ink samples in terms of energy requirement and conductance.
The lowest energy supplied to the sample that resulted in a conductive
pattern with regular ink was 7.5 J/cm2 (10 ms, 220 V),
whereas for the hybrid ink, only 5.5 J/cm2 (6 ms, 220 V)
energy was required; thus, the required threshold energy decreased
by 26%. The hybrid ink also resulted in better conductance values.
For example, the conductance values of the samples with the regular
ink were 0.02 ± 0.004 and 0.027 ± 0.008 S at 10 and 20 ms,
whereas the conductance values of the samples with the hybrid ink
were 0.104 ± 0.003 and 0.106 ± 0.001 S at 10 and 20 ms,
respectively. Thus, the addition of 0.5 wt % CNTs improved the conductance
5-fold in these pulse parameters. To understand the difference in
conductance, we examined the samples’ morphology, as presented
in Figure 8. When the
inks were compared at both pulse durations, it was observed that the
hybrid ink samples were more continuous with larger copper islands
than the samples with the regular ink, thus explaining the better
conductance obtained with the hybrid inks. At 240 V (see the image
presented in Figure S4), there was no difference
in morphology, and accordingly, the conductance of the regular ink
samples was only slightly lower than that of the hybrid ink samples.

and (B) after decomposition.

It should be noted that in addition
to increasing light absorption,
the CNTs may also act as conducting bridges between the copper particles
and therefore improve the overall conductivity. This possibility is
related to the findings of Hwang27 who
added activated MWCNTs to a copper NP ink to retain the conductivity
during bending of copper patterns.

3 Conclusions
We present simple copper precursor inks that can be converted into
conductive copper patterns by the IPL process. Unlike previously reported
MOD inks, the presented inks are composed of a dispersion of copper
salt particles that are stable to oxidation. We think that this approach
will open the way to the development of a new family of MOD inks that
can be implemented for a variety of metal precursors. Obviously, further
optimization of the dispersion-type MOD inks will enable obtaining
higher conductivity while using very high metal loads. We show that
when the copper formate particle ink is used, the mode in which the
energy is supplied is more important than the total energy supplied,
whereas pulses with long durations are preferable for optimal results.
This is similar to the findings7 regarding
the sintering of copper NPs with IPL. Furthermore, we found that the
best conductivity was obtained with two pulses. The first pulse causes
the decomposition of the copper salt, whereas the second pulse causes
sintering and densification of the copper particles formed.

Adding CNTs to copper precursor inks presents a new approach for
improving the efficiency of photonic curing. The CNTs act as a photonic
additive to induce energy absorption and may also function as a conductor
that bridges the gaps in the copper film. As we show by morphology
and conductance results, SWCNTs significantly improve the overall
performance of the printed inks. This is the first time that CNTs
have been used as light absorption enhancers to other conducting materials.
These findings present a powerful approach that would enable expanding
the IPL capabilities to materials that do not absorb light at convenient
and commonly used wavelengths.
The ability to tailor the material such that the pulses with lower
energy will produce results similar to those from pulses with high
energy should have economic implications for commercial production
and use of the technology. As CNTs efficiently absorb light that is
converted to heat, this heat is locally dissipated within the copper
formate, thus inducing its decomposition. The lower illumination settings
cause less heating of the substrate; therefore, the presence of CNTs
may enable the use of more heat-sensitive substrates. We also expect
that addition of photonic additives to conducting inks may lower the
power consumption of IPL tools without compromising the conductivity.
This method presents a viable approach to further decrease the costs
in R2R processes.

4 Experimental Procedures
4.1 Ink Preparation
4.1.1 Preparation of Copper
Formate Dispersion
Ink
Preparation of copper formate dispersion ink was described
previously in ref (16). Submicron particles of copper formate were prepared by ultrafine
wet milling (WAB Dyno mill) of anhydrous copper formate (45 wt %;
Heaven Materials, dried at 80 °C for 3 h) in dipropylene glycol
monomethyl ether (DPM; 47.5 wt %; purum grade, Sigma-Aldrich), with
Disperbyk 180 (7.5 wt %; BYK) as a dispersing agent. The particles
were milled for 30 min at 3200 rpm. After milling, most of the dispersing
agent was separated from the dispersion by centrifugation of the particles
and discarding the supernatant. After the first separation, DPM was
added to the particles (fourfold), and the particles were mixed and
redispersed with Thinky Mixer Ar-100 (Thinky, Japan), followed by
a second centrifugation. This last step was performed once more, leaving
less than 1 solid wt % dispersing agent in the dispersion (determined
by thermogravimetric analysis; STAR system, Mettler Toledo). After
the third centrifugation, the separated copper formate particles were
placed in a Thinky to separate the aggregates formed. PVP 10K (1%,
Alfa Aesar) was added to the ink as a rheological agent for improving
screen printing quality.

4.1.2 Preparation of Hybrid
Copper Formate and
0.5 wt % CNT Dispersion Ink
This ink was prepared similarly
to the above ink,
with the mixing of 0.5 solid wt % HANOS ASP-100F SWCNTs with the dry
copper formate before milling; thus, the CNT and copper formate were
milled together. After separation of the dispersing agent, 1% PVP
10K was added as a rheological agent.

The sizes of the copper
formate particles formed in both inks were evaluated by SEM and were
found to be very similar, with a diameter range of 50–500 nm.
The diameter of the CNTs was ∼15 nm.

4.1.3 Printing
and Post Printing
The
samples were manually printed by screen printing the ink with a polyester
mesh (100 threads/cm; NBC, Ponger 2000) on a polyimide film (125 μm;
Kapton, DuPont). The printed patterns were in the shape of dog bones
(as can be seen in Figure 1) with lines of length 24 mm and width 1.3 mm. After printing,
the samples were dried from solvent by heating for 5 min on a hot
plate at 70 °C.

4.1.4 IPL
Photonic
curing was performed
with a PulseForge 1200 (Novacentrix) system. The energy of single
pulses was determined with the built-in bolometer. It was not possible
to directly measure multiple pulses with the bolometer; according
to Novacentrix, multiple pulses at 1 Hz are identical. Therefore,
energy for treatment with multiple pulses was calculated by multiplying
the energy for a single pulse by the number of pulses. For preliminary
screening experiments, each sample (with three lines) was vertically
divided into eight segments, and each segment was exposed to different
IPL parameters. This was done by covering all other segments with
a 1 mm metal sheet during the IPL processing
of a single segment. For experiments with large samples, the entire
sample was exposed to the IPL at a given setting. In both cases, three
samples were prepared simultaneously. Figure S1 shows a typical sample used for quick screening of the different
pulse parameters, in which the sample was divided into segments (marked
by a dotted line) and each segment was separately exposed to IPL with
different pulse parameters.

4.1.5 Electrical
Conductance Measurements
For preliminary screening experiments
(performed with small segments
of a sample), the resistance was measured by two probes placed at
a constant distance of 2.5 mm. For large samples, the resistance was
measured by two probes placed on a single line at a distance of 22
mm. The average resistance was calculated on the basis of three measurements.
For practical reasons, the examples with a resistivity value outside
the measurement range (i.e., no practical conductance) were attributed
a resistance of 1 000 000 Ω. The reciprocal value
of the average resistance was calculated to give the conductance.

4.1.6 Sample Characterization
Profile
measurements were performed with Veeco’s Dektak 150. SEM and
EDX imaging and measurements were performed with a MagellanT XHR SEM
equipped with an EDX probe (Oxford X-Max; Oxford Instruments, U.K.).
FIB was performed with Helios 600i Nanolab Dualbeam, FEI. Emission
spectra of a single light pulse were obtained from Novacentrix. XRD
measurements were performed using X-ray diffractometer D8 Advance
of Bruker AXS.

4.1.7 Absorptance
The reflectance spectrum
was measured by a CARY 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer
equipped with an integrating sphere (Varian). Samples were bar-coated
on a Kapton film with a #6 bar (K-bar, England) and were measured
with an aluminum sheet background to simulate the same conditions
as those in the PulseForge 1200 system. Absorptance was calculated23,28 using the A + R + T = 1 equation, where A is the absorptance, R is the reflectance, and T is the transmittance. R in the desired spectrum was calculated by dividing the
integral of the % reflectance curve by
the total area of the graph. The samples were measured with an aluminum
background, so the transmittance is equal to zero and the equation
is reduced to A + R = 1.
