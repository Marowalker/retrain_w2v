Herein, nonstoichiometric
structured tin-based anodes for lithium-ion
batteries were directly prepared by a simple and traditional electrodeposition
method. These tin-based anodes show high electrode capacity, excellent
rate performance, and superior stable cycling stability, which delivers
an outstanding reversible capacity of 728 mAh g–1 at the current density of 100 mA g–1 after 400
cycles. When cycled at the current density of 6 A g–1 for 250 cycles, the capacity of the tin-based anode was kept at
about 300 mAh g–1. The tin-based anode with its
nonstoichiometric structure can effectively overcome the volume expansion,
stabilize the electrode structure, and enhance the cyclic stability
through structural reconstruction. By improving the traditional preparation
method, the excellent electrochemical anode can be obtained, which
may greatly promote the commercial application of alloy mechanism
anode materials in lithium-ion batteries.

Introduction
During the past few
decades, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) was considered
as one of the most remarkable energy storage devices for electric
devices, vehicles, and regional power grids, owing to their advantages
of high energy density, long cycling life, cost effectiveness, and
environmental benignity.1−3 However, alternative anode materials
with higher theoretical capacities are highly desired to improve the
performance of LIBs.4,5 As a nontoxic and abundant metal
element with high electrical conductivity, the tin (Sn) anode has
attracted much attention because of its theoretical capacity of 992
mAh g–1 (Li22Sn5). The appropriate
working potential (0.3–0.6 V) of Sn makes the advantages more
prominent than graphite (<0.1 V) by improving the safety. Compared
with the conversion-type anode (such as Fe2O3), a higher energy density can be obtained when paired with a cathode.
Therefore, Sn is regarded as one of the most promising high-capacity
and high-rate anode materials for next-generation LIBs.6−10 Unfortunately, Sn anode materials usually suffer from a massive
volume expansion of 260% during their alloy reactions, which not only
led to the crack, breakage, and even pulverization of the electrode
and loss of active material, but also make the solid electrolyte interface
(SEI) crack and form continuously, reduce the coulombic efficiency,
increase the resistance of ionic transport, and finally led to capacity
fading of the electrode.11−16

To improve the cycling stability of tin-based anodes, some
strategies
have been implemented: (1) reducing the size of Sn particles to the
nanoscale is consensus to release the mechanical stress and buffer
the severe volume change17−19 but the aggregation of Sn nanoparticles
may lead to rapid capacity deterioration; (2) embedding Sn particles
into the conductive matrix is an effective strategy to accommodate
volume expansion, reduce their aggregation, and improve the structural
integrity of the electrode.9,20−27 For example, Zhong et al.28 prepared
two-dimensional Sn@graphene-based nanosheets, and due to the robust
structure of graphene and the interfacial integrity of Sn NPs, the
hybrid exhibited superior lithium storage with high capacity over
1000 mAh g–1 for 1000 cycles. Yang’s group29 synthetized the Sn–Co@C yolk–shell
structure to buffer volumetric expansion and enhance the capacity
of Sn, such that a capacity of about 800 mAh g–1 at 200 mA g–1 for 180 cycles can be achieved.
SnSb nanocrystals of 10–30 nm in size were prepared as anode
materials for LIBs by the Walter group through a simple colloidal
method.30 The as-obtained electrode showed
a capacity of 890 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles at 200
mA g–1; when cycled at a high current density of
5000 mA g–1, it still retained 80% of its theoretical
capacity. The small size of SnSb nanocrystals with fast ionic and
electronic transport not only enhanced the kinetics of the charge/discharge
reactions but also improved the cycling stability by effectively accommodating
volume changes during cycling. Liu’s group synthesized porous
Ni3Sn2 microcages composed of tiny nanoparticles
by the solvothermal method. A capacity of 700 mAh g–1 after 400 cycles at 0.2C was obtained when the as-prepared Ni3Sn2 microcages were used as the anode electrode.31 Their excellent performance that profited from
the short ion-diffusion distance, high contact surface area, good
electronic conductivity, and mechanical capacity interacted with each
other to accommodate volume variations and improve the cycling performance.
Therefore, the formation of Sn–M (M = Ni, Co, Sb, Cu, etc.)
alloy can be an effective way to improve the cycling stability of
Sn anodes. The in situ-formed metallic M can be an inactive matrix
to alleviate the mechanical volume changes and enhance the reaction
kinetics during the cycling process. Highly electronic conductive
Sn–Cu alloy, consisting of active Sn and inactive Cu, can not
only enhance the reaction kinetics of Sn nanoparticles and provide
high reversible capacity and rate performance but also buffer the
volume expansion, avoid the agglomeration of Sn nanoparticles, and
improve the cycling stability, which may be a promising anode material
for LIBs. Owing to the characteristics of being cost-effective and
easy to scale-up, electrodeposition has been extensively researched
for application in LIBs.6,16,32−37 Compared with other conventional electrodes, superior advantages
were shown by the electrodeposited anode electrode. First, electrodeposition
is mature and easy to industrialize, as the thickness and composition
of the deposit layer can be accurately controlled by adjusting the
electroplating parameters and electrolyte state. Second, the as-prepared
samples deposited on copper can be used in LIBs directly without mixing
and coating, which saves the time and cost in the production process
of LIBs.

Herein, we designed and developed a multistage electrodeposition
strategy to prepare the nonstoichiometric Sn–Cu alloy anode.
The structural reconstruction of the nonstoichiometric structure buffered
the volume expansion of Sn and enhanced the structural stability of
the electrode during the cycling process. An outstanding reversible
capacity of 728 mAh g–1 at a current density of
100 mA g–1 after 400 cycles was delivered. When
cycled at the high current density of 6 A g–1 for
250 cycles, the capacity of the Sn–Cu alloy anode still maintained
at about 300 mAh g–1, which greatly enhanced its
potential for commercial application in lithium-ion batteries.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared Sn–Cu
alloys. The three Sn–Cu alloy electrodes exhibited a similar
phase structure, and all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to
two phases. All the distinct diffraction peaks can be indexed to Cu
elementary substance (cubic, Fm3̅m (225), JCPDS card no. 70-3039) and Cu6Sn5 (hexagonal, P63/mmc (194), JCPDS card no. 47-1575),
which might be derived from the Cu current collector and the main
component of the electroplating Sn–Cu alloy, respectively.
A comparison of the three patterns in detail (the inset image) shows
that the patterns of sample C were slightly shifted to a large angle
area, and the interplanar spacing of sample C was relatively small
as inferred by the Bragg equation; the tight lattice structure may
buffer volume expansion during the discharge/charge process and enhance
its cycling stability.

and

Figure 2 shows
the
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the
three electrodes. Comparing Figure 2a,c,e, we observe that all the samples were formed
by primary spherical particles (10–20 nm) mutually stacked
and assembled on the Cu current collector, whereas the morphology
and structure of the three samples varied with the electrodeposition
process and parameters. Sample A (Figure 2b) prepared with low consistent voltage (7
V) has the smallest secondary particle size (100 nm) and dense structure
among the tiny nanoparticles, and in Figure 2d, the particle size of sample B (consistent
voltage of 10 V) is the largest with a diameter of ∼700 nm,
in which the internal particles are difficult to be activated. The
plane structure of the electrode was relatively loose. As shown in Figure 2f, sample C has a
similar particle density and uniform structure with sample A. The
difference was that the secondary particle size of sample C was about
300 nm.

Figure 2 FESEM images of sample A (a, b), B (c, d), and C (e, f) with different
magnifications.

The content of Sn and
Cu in Sn–Cu alloy varied with the
depth of the electrodeposited coating. As shown in Figure 3, the thickness of the Cu current
collector was about 10 μm according to the cross-sectional images
and the elemental content, of which Cu was about 100% and the content
of Sn is about 0. In Figure 3a,d, with the thickening of the electrodeposited coating,
the Cu and Sn contents of sample A changed rapidly and achieved stability
after the buffer layer was only about 2 μm. The electrode was
dense and uniform according to the cross-sectional image, and the
contents of Cu and Sn were both about 40%. Sample B (Figure 3b,e) was different from sample
A. The contents of Cu and Sn were also 39 and 47% on the outside surface
of electrode B. However, the content of Cu decreased slowly during
the electroplating process, and layered crevices appeared. A few small
cracks were observed at the interface between the Cu current collector
and electrodeposition layer, which illustrated that the coating was
relatively loose. Sample C (Figure 3c,f) was different from samples A and B. The content
of Cu decreased slightly and uniformly to about 40%, whereas the content
of Sn increased quickly and remained at about 58%. The buffer layer
was loose and the outside layer was dense. Combining the sectional
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with the XRD pattern, whether
the Cu6.5Sn5 peak shift or the mismatch of Sn–Cu
content, indicated that the Sn–Cu content of sample C is nonstoichiometric.
That is, sample C existed in the nonstoichiometric structure.

Figure 3 Cross-sectional
images (a–c) and linear EDS patterns (d–f)
of samples A–C before cycling.

The galvanostatic charge and discharge curves of sample C
at different
cycles are recorded in Figure 4a at the current density of 100 mA g–1.
The initial charge and discharge capacities were 590.9 and 811.7 mAh
g–1 with the initial coulombic efficiency of 72.8%.
The irreversible capacity might be assigned to the formation of an
SEI film.17,19 In the first discharge step, three flat
plateaus for electrode C at about 0.9, 0.4, and 0.1 V correspond to
the formation of an solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film, the consecutive
formation of an intermediate phase (Li2CuSn), and the alloy
reaction (Li4.4Sn), respectively, and the voltage platforms
at 0.2, 0.5, and 0.9 V of the charge curve are assigned to the dealloying
reaction.11,38−40 After the initial capacity
decay, the charge/discharge profiles maintain a relatively good agreement.
As a comparison, the charge and discharge curves of sample A and sample
B at different cycles are shown in Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2). Sample A demonstrated a rapid
capacity decay and larger and larger distance between the discharge
and charge voltage plateaus from 1st to 400th, which imply the serious
deterioration of electrode A during the cycling process. Sample B
showed a similar trend to sample A at the initial stage of about 50
cycles, then it increases gradually until it becomes stable. However,
the position and curve of the voltage platform changes vary greatly,
illustrating the inferior structural stability of sample B.

cycles (a); cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of sample C at the scanning

and 2.5 V (c); rate performance of sample C at different current densities

equivalent circuit model of sample C at different cycles during the

Figure 4b
shows
the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of sample C at the scanning rate
of 0.25 mV s–1 between 0.01 and 2.75 V (vs Li+/Li). At the first cathodic sweep, the peaks at around 1.0,
0.5, and 0.10 V and an irreversible broad peak were observed, and
the first irreversible peak at 1 V could be attributed to the formation
of an SEI layer by decomposition of the electrolyte. The reaction
mechanism of Cu6Sn5 about the intermediate ternary
phase transformation of Li–Cu–Sn during the discharge/charge
process had been researched by many groups.25,36,41−47 Generally, the potential peak at about 0.5 V corresponded to the
η′-Cu6Sn5 phase transformation
into the Li2CuSn-type phase and the peak below 0.2 V was
attributed to the lithiation of Sn to Li4.4Sn (reaction 1). At the anodic
sweep, the peaks at 0.5, 0.9, and 1.0 V could be attributed to the
reversible dealloying reaction of LixSn. 1  Figure 4c shows the long-term cycling performance of sample A, sample
B, and sample C at the density current of 0.1 A g–1 between 0.01 and 2.5 V. Sample A and sample B both exhibited rapid
decay in about the first 10 cycles. This might be attributed to the
inactivation of active Sn caused by severe volume expansion and pulverization
of Sn nanoparticles with a loose surface structure during the discharge/charge
reaction. Then, sample A decayed seriously after a short activation,
the phenomenon of which had been reported in previous reports,16,24,48 which was usually explained by
aggregation of active Sn and the shedding of active layers from the
current collector. Sample B increased slowly from 380 to 600 mAh g–1 at the 300th cycle after the decay stage and stabilized
at 600 mAh g–1 until 400th. Due to the large size
of sample B, it took a long time to infiltrate and activate the Sn
particles in the inner layer of the Sn–Cu alloy during the
cycling process, and when the active material was fully activated,
the capacity maintained at a steady value. It was proved that Cu in
sample B could improve the cycling performance. Although sample C
remained stable at about 650 mAh g–1 after 400 cycles,
the compact and uniform structure and high content of inactive Cu
might play an important role in buffering the volume expansion and
enhancing the structural stability.

The rate capabilities of
electrode C with different current densities
are shown in Figure 4d. Obviously, the sample C electrode presents excellent rate performance.
At the current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, and 3 A
g–1, the average specific capacities of electrode
C were about 453, 356, 340, 348, 353.9, 367.7, 347.4, and 290.4 mAh
g–1, respectively. When cycled at 3 A g–1, a capacity retention of 63.7% could still be retained. Moreover,
when the current density returned to 0.1 A g–1,
a capacity of 503 mAh g–1 was attained again, which
was even higher than those of the first 10 cycles. Furthermore, electrode
C exhibited a satisfactory cycling performance at high current density,
even when cycled at 6 A g–1 for 300 discharge/charge
cycles, the specific capacity of electrode C still remains stable
at 293 mAh g–1, which is remarkably enhanced than
previous reports36,49 (Figure S3).

To further understand the dynamics change of sample C during
the
cycling process, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
spectra were recorded after 1st, 3rd, and 20th cycles. The Nyquist
plots are shown in Figure 4e. The depressed semicircle in high and medium frequencies
can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance and solid electrolyte
interphase (Rct + RSEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interface and the slope line
in the low frequency range related to the Warburg impedance (Zw), which is referred to as Li+ diffusion.6,35,36,50 An equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Figure 4e, and the fitted parameters
of circuit elements are shown in Table 1. From the 1st to 3rd cycle, the values of Rct + RSEI and Zw increased notably, which was attributed to
the formation of an SEI film and the irreversible structural injury
at the initial stage of cycling. After the 20th cycle, Rct + RSEI and Zw reduced obviously, implying that the SEI film was well-established,
and charge transfer resistance and the resistance of Li+ diffusion reduce after electrode activation for several cycles.

Circuit Elements
cycle number	fresh	3rd	20th	
Rs/Ω	2.54	3.27	8.50	
Rct + RSEI/Ω	77.71	188.4	172.1	
Zw/Ω	601.4	241.0	110.0	
To further observe the structural
change of the three electrodes,
the morphology of the plant and cross section of the three electrodes
after 400 cycles are shown in Figure 5. Consistent with our previous inference, particle
pulverization and structural expansion could be observed in all the
electrodes after 400 cycles, which induced structural reconstruction.
Electrode A with a dense structure showed the severe crack on the
electrode and dissociation from the Cu current collector in the cross
section, which could be caused by severe aggregation of Sn nanoparticles
and/or the stress changes of the active layer during the cycling process.
Sample B was slightly better than sample A. The structural crack on
the plane was still significant, whereas the active layer was still
connected with the current collector. This might be because the loose
electrode structure reduced the stress difference during the cycling.
Sample C maintained the relatively continuous and complete structure.
This might be attributed to the structural reconstruction of the nonstoichiometric
structure, which buffered the volume expansion of Sn and enhanced
the structural stability of the electrode during the cycling process
in sample C. The possible scheme of structural reconstruction of the
electrodes is shown in Figure 6.

Conclusions
In this paper, Sn–Cu
alloy film anodes for lithium-ion batteries
were designed and prepared by a traditional and scalable multistage
electrodeposition method. The electrode structure reconstruction occurred
during the cycling owing to their nonstoichiometric structure that
buffered the volume expansion of Sn and enhanced the structural stability.
The nonstoichiometric structured Sn–Cu alloy anodes showed
high electrode capacity, excellent rate performance, superior stable
cycling capability, and delivered an outstanding reversible capacity
of 728 mAh g–1 at a current density of 300 mA g–1 after 400 cycles. Even when cycled at the current
density of 6 A g–1 for 250 cycles, the capacity
of the Sn–Cu alloy anode was still maintained at about 300
mAh g–1, which greatly promoted the commercial application
of alloy mechanism anode electrode materials in LIBs.

Experimental
Section
The processes involving the preparation of electroplating
solution
and pretreatment of the electrode plate have been described in detail
in our previous report.35 The electrodeposition
reaction occurred in an electrolytic cell. For this, 6 g of K4P2O7·3H2O, 3.72 g of
SnCl2·2H2O, 2.82 g of CuCl2·2H2O, and 3 mL of electroplating refiner were dissolved in deionized
water to obtain 300 mL of electroplating solution. A titanium plate
and copper foil after pretreatment were the anode and cathode of the
electrolytic cell, and the distance between the two polar plates was
about 4 cm. The electrodes were obtained by constant voltage electrodeposition.
When the voltage was constant kept at 7 V for 5 min, the obtained
electrode can be named sample A; sample B was obtained by changing
the constant voltage to 10 V and depositing for 5 min; sample C was
prepared in two steps by keeping the voltage constant at 10 V for
30 s and then changing the voltage to 7 V for 4.5 min. The obtained
electrodes were cleaned with pure ethanol and water and dried in a
vacuum oven for 10 h. The loading mass of the electrodes is about
1.7 mg cm–2.
