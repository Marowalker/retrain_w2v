Herein, two versatile bran-new methods
have been developed for
building three new kinds of complicated-framework compounds including
2,4,4-trimethyl-2-(phenylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5-ones, 4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-1,3,3′,4,4′,5-hexahydro-5′H-spiro-[benzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]-chromen]-5′-ones, and 2,2,4′,4′-tetramethyl-2,3,3′,4′-tetrahydro-5H,5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]-oxazepine-4,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-ones
in a one-pot manner via four-molecule and five-molecule cascade reactions
of commercially available 4-hydroxychromen-2-one, substituted anilines,
and acetone. In consideration of these impressive features including
no need of additional catalysts and solvents, moderate to good yields,
excellent site-selectivity, and broad substrate/functional group tolerance,
we believe that the two present protocols should have the potential
for broad synthetic utility.

Introduction
Multi-component reaction
(MCR) has emerged as one of the most popular
and powerful approaches for the one-pot synthesis of important natural
products, organic building blocks, and pharmaceutical intermediates.1,2 Because of the reduced number of reaction steps and simple operation,
MCR usually leads to reduced waste of the starting materials and acceptable
yields of the corresponding products in a step/atom-economical and
environmentally benign fashion.3,4 As a result, over the
past decade, remarkable advances have been made on this topic.5−9 Despite this compelling progress, most studies often suffer from
one or more of the following disadvantages, such as the compulsive
dependence on heavy metal or expensive metal catalysts,10 and the utilization of harmful11 and/or expensive reagents.12 Undoubtedly, the further development of mild, efficient, and general
MCRs for the direct assembly of a key structural motif is still highly
desired.13

It is well-known that
4-hydroxychromen-2-one is a star molecule.
To date, a large number of studies have demonstrated that it has a
wide range of biological activities15−17 including antioxidant
activity,14 antibacterial activity,15 and anti-cancer activity.16 Moreover, a lot of classical organic synthetic reactions
have showed that acetone can smoothly react with aniline to generate
the electron-rich iso-propenylphenylamine or iso-propylidenephenylamine. Alternatively, it could also
easily react with 4-hydroxychromen-2-one to yield 3-iso-propylidenechroman-2,4-dione in decent yield. On the basis of these
results and by analyzing the chemical properties of the two resulting
compounds, we envisaged that the in situ combination of the above
two condensed products might lead to the synthesis of interesting
complex molecules via the Michael addition reaction under proper conditions.
Inspired by this and in continuation of our interest in developing
efficient protocols for the construction of valuable heterocyclic
compounds,18 we herein explore the tandem
reactions of 4-hydroxychromen-2-ones, substituted anilines, and ketone
compounds.

To this end, we succeeded in establishing two bran-new
four-molecule
and five-molecule reactions of substituted anilines, 4-hydroxychromen-2-one,
and acetone under catalyst- and solvent-free reactions (Scheme 1). The structures of the products
were identified by X-ray single crystal diffraction, high-resolution
mass spectroscopy (HRMS), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and
elemental analysis. In addition, the possible reaction mechanism was
rationally proposed on the basis of the experimental investigations.

Scheme 1 Bran-New Four-Molecule and Five-Molecule Reactions of Substituted
Aniline, 4-Hydroxychromen-2-one, and Acetone
Briefly, the first reaction was the intermolecular condensation
of anilines, 4-hydroxy-chromen-2-ones, and acetone, which formed 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-(phenylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5-ones;
the second reaction was the intermolecular condensation of 4-hydroxychromen-2-ones,
acetone, and benzene-1,2-diamine or 2-amino-phenols, respectively,
which generated 4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-1,3,3′,4,4′,5-hexahydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-ones and 2,2,4′,4′-tetramethyl-2,3,3′,4′-tetrahydro-5H,5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]oxazepine-4,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-ones.

Results
and Discussion
Determination of the Structures of the Products
by X-ray Diffraction
Analysis
4-Hydroxychromen-2-one, acetone, and aniline, benzene-1,2-diamine,
or 2-aminophenol, were respectively selected as the starting materials
to obtain three desired products, 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-(phenylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H,5H-pyrano-[3,2-c]chromen-5-one
(4a), 4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-1,3,3′,4,4′,5-hexahydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-one (5a), and 2,2,4′,4′-tetramethyl-2,3,3′,4′-tetrahydro-5H,5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]oxazepine-4,2′-pyrano-[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-one
(6a). Their structures were further confirmed by single
crystal X-ray analysis.

Mechanistic Speculation of the Reaction
First
Kind of Reaction: Four-Molecule Reaction
To explore
the reaction mechanism, a mixture of acetone, aniline, and 4-hydroxychromen-2-one
was refluxed for 6 h, and HRMS was run to probe the possible intermediates.

Gratefully, two key intermediates, iso-propylidenephenylamine
(I) and 3-iso-propylidenechroman-2,4-dione
(II), were successfully identified by HRMS. On the basis
of the findings, the possible reaction mechanism was proposed as following
(Scheme 2): first,
acetone reacts respectively with aniline and 4-hydroxychromen-2-one
to form two intermediates, iso-propylidenephenylamine
or iso-propenylphenylamine (I), and
3-iso-propylidenechroman-2,4-dione (II). Subsequently, the Michael-addition-type reaction of I and II provides the target compound 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-phenylamino-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5-one (III, 4a), in which the intermediate I acts
as an electron-donating substrate.

Scheme 2 Mechanism of the Four-Molecule Cascade
Reaction of 4-Hydroxychromen-2-one,
Aniline, and Acetone
Second Kind of Reaction: Five-Molecule Reaction
On
the basis of the deduced mechanism of the four-molecule reaction,
as shown above, and the reported information of 2,2-dimethyl-4-methylene-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b][1,4]diazepine (IV),19,20 the reaction mechanism for the formation
of 4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-1,3,3′,4,4′,5-hexahydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-one (V) via a five-molecule
reaction is proposed in Scheme 3. To further confirm the plausible reaction pathway, the intermediate IV was prepared and designated as a substrate for this reaction.
The treatment of IV and 4-hydroxychromen-2-one in acetone
under otherwise identical conditions gave the desired product 5a in good yield. On the basis of the result and in combination
with the fact that II and IV were successfully
identified by HRMS, we concluded that the five-molecule reaction should
use II and IV as the active intermediates,
which supported our proposed mechanism listed in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Mechanism of the
Five-Molecule Cascade Reaction of 4-Hydroxychromen-2-one,
Benzene-1,2-diamine, and Acetone
Similarly, II and VI should
be employed
as the key intermediates for the formation of 2,2,4′,4′-tetramethyl-2,3,3′,4′-tetrahydro-5H,5′H-spiro-[benzo[b][1,4]-oxazepine-4,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-one
(VII, 6a), and thus, a plausible mechanism
is proposed in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Mechanism of the Five-Molecule Cascade Reaction of 4-Hydroxychromen-2-one,
2-Aminophenol, and Acetone
Furthermore, 2-(2-hydroxyphenylamino)-2,4,4-trimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H,5H-pyrano-[3,2-c]-chromen-5-one
(VIII) was prepared and designated as a proposed intermediate
to verify this reaction mechanism. Thus, VIII was treated
with acetone, and the obtained mixture was refluxed for 8 h. However,
compound 6a was not obtained (Scheme 5). The result revealed that this reaction
should use VI, instead of VIII, as the reaction
intermediate.

Reaction Conditions Optimization
Screening
for the Reaction Temperature
Initially, aniline,
4-hydroxychromen-2-one, and acetone were employed as the model substrates
for the optimization of the reaction conditions. As shown in Table 1, we found that temperature
was crucial for the reaction. The reaction proceeded very slowly at
room temperature, and the product yield could be improved with the
increase of reaction temperature (entries 1–4). As the boiling
point of acetone is 56 °C under air, here, the reaction temperature
was selected to be 60 °C.

Screening for the Reaction
Time and Molecular Molar Ratio
Moreover, our investigation
showed that the reaction time and molecular
molar ratio of the three components played an important role in the
reaction outcome. Through a set of investigations, we found that:
(1) refluxing the reaction for 24 h offered the highest yield; (2)
the optimal molecular molar ratio of 4-hydroxychromen-2-one/aniline/acetone
was 1:1:10.

Screening for the Catalyst and Solvent
To further optimize
the reaction conditions, several simple catalysts were also investigated.
The results indicated that the application of basic catalysts (entries
9–12), such as triethylamine (Et3N), could enhance
the reaction rate when the reaction proceeded at room temperature,
whereas the catalytic efficiency of triethylamine was not obvious
when the reaction was carried out at refluxing temperature (entries
14–16). Pyridine, piperidine, and N,N-dimethylpyridine (DMAP) exhibited the same behavior as
that of triethylamine. Furthermore, the presence of K2CO3 obviously inhibited the outcome of the reaction (entry 13).
Inspired by these results, a slight excess of aniline was used instead
of the additional basic catalysts in this work.

Acids, such
as p-toluene sulfonic acid (p-TsOH),
acetic acid (AcOH), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and zinc chloride
(ZnCl2), also obviously inhibited the process (entries
5–8), which further confirmed the reaction mechanism.

The solvent effect on the reaction was also investigated, and the
results showed that the utilization of solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran,
dichloromethane, butanone, toluene, or [1,4]-dioxane, did not obviously
improve the product yield, and therefore, a slight excess of acetone
was used in this work.

In summary, and with the aim to meet
the objectives of green chemistry,
the optimal conditions were identified as follows: the mole ratio
of 4-hydroxychromen-2-one/aniline/acetone was 1.00:1.05:10.00, and
the reacting mixture was refluxed at 60 °C for 24 h.

Substrate Scope of Substituted Anilines
Having the
optimized conditions in hand, the scope of the reaction with respect
to various anilines was then evaluated (Scheme 6). To our delight, we found that the developed
catalyst- and solvent-free system proved to be broadly applicable,
thus delivering the desired products 4a–q in moderate to good yields, in which the electron-donating
anilines gave relatively higher yields than the electron-withdrawing
substrates, suggesting that the electrical properties of the substituent
played a key role in this transformation. Further investigations showed
that no reaction was detected when those bearing the strong electron-withdrawing
group on the benzene ring, including the carboxyl, formyl, and nitro
substituents, were employed as the aniline substrates. The results further confirmed our above conclusion and also hinted
at the reaction mechanism because a larger electron density was more
likely to occur during the first concentration reaction than the second
Michael-addition reaction. That is to say, the electron density of
the nitrogen atom of aniline played a vital role in determining the
MCR outcome. To better define the scope of this reaction, we further
explored several heterocyclic amines such as 2-aminopyridine (2u), benzothiazol-2-ylamine (2v), and 4-amino-1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-pyrazol-3-one
(2w). However, no expected products were observed, indicating
that the presence of the phenyl group was crucial for this MCR.

Products
Isolated yields. NR means no
desired product was formed.

Surprisingly,
another kind of bran-new product, named 4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-1,3,3′,4,4′,5-hexahydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,2′-pyrano-[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-one, was formed easily by using o-phenylenediamine as the substrate. Encouraged by this
finding, we sought to investigate the scope and limitations of o-phenylenediamine substrates. As given in Scheme 7, we were pleased to find that
the reaction proceeded smoothly to give the desired products 5a–d in moderate to good isolated yields,
and both electron-donating and -withdrawing groups at the para-position
were all well tolerated. Of note, o-aminophenol was
also found to suitable substrates for this reaction because the treatment
of o-aminophenol and its analogues with 4-hydroxychromen-2-one
and acetone gave their corresponding products 6a–c in 39–49% isolated yields.

or o-Aminophenols and Their Products 5a–d and 6a–c
Isolated yields.

Substrate Scope of 4-Hydroxychromen-2-ones
To further
probe the substrate tolerance of this reaction, we investigated the
scope of β-diketone compounds, such as 1H-indene-1,3(2H)-dione, 1,3-cyclohexanedione, 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone,
pentane-2,4-dione, and ethyl 3-oxo-butanoate (for their detailed chemical
structures, see Figure 1) to replace 4-hydroxychromen-2-one. However, no reaction was observed
in the two catalyst- and solvent-free MCR systems.

β-diketone compounds to replace 4-hydroxychromen-2-one.

Substrate Scope of Ketone
Compounds
Moreover, some
carbonyl compounds, such as aromatic aldehydes, aliphatic-aldehydes,
butanone, 2-pentone, pentane-2,4-dione, hexane-2,5-dione, cyclohexanone,
and cyclopentanone (for their detailed chemical structures, see Figure 2), were also scanned
to replace acetone for the two MCRs. However, the results also showed
that no desired products were obtained.

aldehyde and ketone compounds to replace
acetone.

It should be noted that aromatic
aldehyde compounds, such as benzaldehyde,
could react smoothly with 4-hydroxychromen-2-one and aniline to provide
3-benzylidenechromane-2,4-dione and N,1-diphenylmethanimine
as the final products (Scheme 8). However, N,1-diphenylmethanimine could
not further react with 3-benzylidenechromane-2,4-dione via Michael-addition
reaction (Scheme 8a).
This might be because N,1-diphenylmethanimine could
not be converted to the enamine form via a 1,3-proton shift. Therefore, it did not possess the capability in the reaction with
3-benzylidenechromane-2,4-dione to achieve Michael addition. Alternatively,
the result from HRMS analysis showed that benzaldehyde reacted with
2-fold of 4-hydroxychromen-2-one to form 3,3′-(phenylmethylene)bis-(4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) (Scheme 8b).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have established two simple and practicable reactions
for one-pot constructing three kinds of compounds with a novel molecular
skeleton, including 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-(phenylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen-5-ones,
4,4,4′,4′-tetramethyl-1,3,3′,4,4′,5-hexahydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-ones, and 2,2,4′,4′-tetramethyl-2,3,3′,4′-tetrahydro-5H,5′H-spiro[benzo[b][1,4]oxazepine-4,2′-pyrano[3,2-c]chromen]-5′-ones,
when commercially and easily available 4-hydroxychromen-2-one, acetone,
and substituted anilines were employed as the versatile substrates.
The bran-new four-molecule and five-molecule cascade reactions could
be carried out smoothly under mild and catalyst- and solvent-free
conditions with broad substrate/functional group tolerance and excellent
site-selectivity. Thus, they should have the potential for broad synthetic
utility in organic synthetic chemistry, i.e., for one-pot and green
syntheses of bioactive compounds, natural products, and organic building
blocks that contain the three key basic frameworks.
