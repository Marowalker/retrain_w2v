The study of inorganic nanometer-scale
materials with hollow closed-cage
structures, such as inorganic fullerene-like (IF) nanostructures and
inorganic nanotubes (INTs), is a rapidly growing field. Numerous kinds
of IF nanostructures and INTs were synthesized for a variety of applications,
particularly for lubrication, functional coatings, and reinforcement
of polymer matrices. To date, such nanostructures have been synthesized
mostly by heating a transition metal or oxide thereof in the presence
of precursor gases, which are however toxic and hazardous. In this
context, one frontier of research in this field is the development
of new avenues for the green synthesis of IF structures and INTs,
directly from the bulk of layered compounds. In the present work,
we demonstrate a simple room-temperature and environmentally friendly
approach for the synthesis of IF nanostructures and INTs via ultrashort-pulse
laser ablation of a mixture of transition-metal dichalcogenides in
bulk form mixed with Pb/PbO, in ambient air. The method can be considered
as a synergy of photothermally and photochemically induced chemical
transformations. The ultrafast-laser-induced excitation of the material,
complemented with the formation of extended hot annealing regions
in the presence of the metal catalyst, facilitates the formation of
different nanostructures. Being fast, easy, and material-independent,
our method offers new opportunities for the synthesis of IF nanostructures
and INTs from different bulk metal chalcogenide compounds. On the
basis of the capabilities of laser technology as well, this method
could advantageously be further developed into a versatile tool for
the simultaneous growth and patterning of such nanostructures in preselected
positions for a variety of applications.

Introduction
Since
the discovery of the nested inorganic fullerene-like nanoparticles
(IF-NPs) and inorganic nanotubes (INTs) of tungsten disulfide (WS2) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),1 by heating thin metal films of W and Mo in the presence
of gaseous H2S, a whole new field opened up with opportunities
in research and applications. The multilayered two-dimensional elements
are unstable in their microscopic form and spontaneously form closed
structures with a hollow core. Layered materials formed from inorganic
elements are abundant. In bulk form, these structures appear as platelets,
wherein each platelet is composed of molecular slabs held by weak
van der Waals forces. Typical examples of such structures from WS2 and MoS2 were reported in numerous works. Transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) are trilayer X–M–X sandwiches,
where X = S or Se and M = a transition metal. Besides these, numerous
fullerene-like NPs and INTs were synthesized through the years from
different layered structure materials, including BN,2 TaS2,3 and NiCl2,4 and ternary layered (misfit)
compounds.5 Owing to their remarkable properties,
many studies have focused on the stability and the structure6 of the IF-NPs and INTs of WS2 and
MoS2 in addition to their significant mechanical, optical,
and electronic properties.7 As a result,
IF nanostructures from WS2 and MoS2 have been
effectively used and commercialized in various applications, particularly
as solid lubricants.8 In addition, numerous
applications of these NPs have been proposed, including in reinforcing
polymer nanocomposites,9 nanoelectronics,10 energy production,11 and storage.12 Besides this, the nontoxic
nature of such materials, as has been pointed out in several studies,13 is a prime motivation for medical applications.14 The growth mechanism of these structures has
become a highly explored topic for many researchers.15 One can distinguish between two main research strategies:
(a) high-temperature synthesis under a chemically controlled atmosphere
and (b) using energy burst to ablate powder and induce a reaction
under far from equilibrium conditions. The studies on (a) were mostly
based on the reactions of hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide or sulfur-containing
vapors with metal-oxide NPs or another metal precursor at typical
temperatures between 500 and 1000 °C. These conditions allow
for the synthesis of metastable phases of MX2 under not
far from equilibrium conditions. The most common synthesis method
for large-scale production of IF-NPs and INTs is sulfidization of
metal oxides under reducing conditions.16 Here, the reaction parameters can be modified and controlled systematically,
enabling the mass production of the IF-NPs and INTs of WS2 as well as MoS2 for a variety of applications. On the
other hand, reactions in the (b) category occur under far from equilibrium
conditions and cannot be easily controlled. Despite the great success
with the production of single-wall carbon nanotubes and C60, these methods have not been well developed for their inorganic
analogues so far. Fortunately, this kind of reaction opens windows
of metastability not accessible for the thermally induced reactions
of (a). An excellent proof of concept was the first synthesis of MoS2 nano-octahedra, which were dubbed the “true inorganic
fullerenes”.17 In this context,
different approaches were used by several research groups, such as
arc discharge,18 shock waves,19 solar ablation,17 and laser ablation,6b,20 which yielded remarkable results.
Another interesting approach was presented recently21 utilizing a focused solar beam and a growth promoter in
the form of a heavy metal. The beam is generating continuous extreme
temperatures exceeding 2500 °C and temperature gradients (103 K/mm) in the presence of a metal catalyst (Pb), which lead
to the formation of various inorganic nanotubes. The presence of the
metal catalyst seems to promote the growth of new hybrid structures
with a metal core–semiconductor shell.

Furthermore, although
considerable research has been devoted to
the large-scale synthesis of IF nanostructures and INTs, less attention
has been paid to avoiding the use of toxic and hazardous gases such
as H2S and H2. Hence, the development of a more
environmentally friendly synthetic method remains a challenge.

In this context, we demonstrate here a new synthesis path toward
fullerene-like NPs and INTs from the bulk, via ultrafast laser ablation
in ambient air (Figure 1). Contrary to previous laser ablation approaches,6b,20 our method does not require inert conditions. The ultrafast-laser-induced
excitation and ablation of the irradiated material lead to extreme
temperatures and heat gradients, enabling the synthesis of metastable
MX2 phases under far from equilibrium conditions. Accordingly,
this method provides the potential for the synthesis of nanostructures
that cannot be attained by conventional synthetic routes. This technique
is fast and does not require the use of hazardous precursor gases
and thus expensive equipment. Not less important is the possibility
for, on-demand, simultaneous growth and patterning of nanostructures
in preselected locations. Finally, it is a material-independent technique
and thus can be further extended for the direct synthesis of other
TMD nanostructures.

synthesis
of TMD nanostructures under ambient conditions.

Results
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed
that laser irradiation
of MoS2 gives rise to nanowhiskers and IF-NPs, whereas
that of WS2 yields INTs. For MoS2 in particular,
the irradiating powder comprises MoS2 platelets (Figure 2a) decorated with
nanowhiskers, with no indication of nanotubes. A closer inspection
with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed interesting faceted
IF-NPs, colocated in the same area with nanowhiskers, with sizes ranging
between 80 and 200 nm, as presented in Figure 3a,b. The layered structure of the walls forming
such NPs can be clearly resolved in the respective images. The inset
of Figure 3c represents
the line profile with the measured interlayer distance to be 0.61
nm, which corresponds to the interlayer distance (c/2) of MoS2. Whereas some of the IF-NPs produced appear
as having a hollow core, others seem to have a darker contrast inside
their interior. Nevertheless, the energy-dispersive spectropscopy
(EDS) measurements performed on single particles consistently gave
an almost perfect 1:2 Mo/S ratio, as presented in the inset of Figure 3d. Besides this,
the amount of oxygen was negligible, therefore the possibility of
a core composed out of oxidized molybdenum or pure molybdenum can
be discarded. Furthermore, the undistorted Mo/S ratio points to a
MoS2 core. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) imaging, as shown
in Figure 4a,b, also
revealed sharp edges and corners of these NPs with distinct fringes,
whereas the internal structure begins exactly where the layers end.
This indicates the inside-out growth mechanism, where a small MoS2 (nano) platelet serves as a template (growth nucleus), which
is subsequently sheathed layer by layer upon irradiation. Figures 5 and 6 represent the TEM images of the sharp corner and a faceted
edge, respectively, at different tilt angles. The feature in Figure 5 is virtually unaltered
as the tilt angle changes from −20 to +20°; this observation
confirms that the imaged feature is a sharp corner. On the other hand, Figure 6 shows a faceted
edge, which appears as more rounded at negative angles, whereas it
changes into sharper edges upon tilting to +20°.

On the other hand, SEM
imaging of the irradiated WS2 powder revealed that INTs
are growing from WS2 platelets
(Figure 7a–d).
The nanotubes’ dimensions ranged from 20 to 100 nm in width
and were approximately 1 μm in length. It can be observed that
the outermost surface of the exposed platelets appears to be completely
covered by INTs. The mild sonication procedure used for the preparation
of TEM grids detaches the INTs from the platelets, leaving one of
the edges open, whereas the other is usually closed. A representative
WS2 nanotube is presented in the TEM image of Figure 8a,b. The interlayer
spacing, as shown in the inset of Figure 8a, is close to 0.625 nm, which is slightly
larger than the distance between the two neighboring layers of WS2 (c/2 = 0.62 nm). Moreover, it was observed
that some of the INTs synthesized exhibited a hollow core, whereas
the rest were filled with material. Because the number of layers on
both sides of INTs is the same, as shown in Figure 9a,b, it is possible that the core is made
through a posteriori filling of the pre-prepared nanotubes. In analogy
to the case of the previously discussed IF-MoS2 NPs, the
amount of oxygen found in the laser-synthesized INT-WS2 was negligible. On the contrary, by EDS analysis, the W/S ratio
was found to be approximately 1:1 in all cases, as shown in the inset
of Figure 8b. There
can be several explanations for this phenomenon. Most likely, because
W is much heavier than both Mo and S, the count rate is rather low.
Hence, the deviations of the model calculations for the atom %, which
are extracted directly from the detector, are larger. Additionally,
this analysis takes into account only specific lines (the K line for
sulfur and the L line for tungsten). Although these are the predominant
ones, including the other lines may change the W/S ratio. On the other
hand, the existence of the core may be attributed to its filling with
excess sulfur.

Discussion
The first question arising
from the experimental findings presented
here is the role of lead in the synthesis of the inorganic nanostructures.
Back in 2012, MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) nanotubes were
produced by solar ablation of the respective powder in the presence
of lead. In fact, according to the proposed growth mechanism, the
originally ablated MX2 + Pb powder was first converted
into MO3–x nanowhiskers. The lead
atoms were incorporated into the MO3–x lattice, making it more stable and promoting the growth of
a nanowhisker.21 Further irradiation of
the nanowhiskers in the presence of the chalcogenide vapor leads to
back-conversion of the metal oxide into MX2 nanotubes.
More recently, core–shell nanotubes and fullerene-like structures
of Pb@GaS were obtained via solar ablation of the mixed powder.22 In this work, GaS layers wrapped the Pb nanotemplate
conformably, producing such intriguing nanostructures. In contrast
to these cases, no lead was found within or in the vicinity of the
IF/INT MoS2/WS2 nanostructures produced via
the laser ablation approach presented here. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the presence of lead may not play any direct significant role
in the production of the nanostructures reported here; further experiments
are currently in progress to confirm the insignificant role of lead.
Nevertheless, no IF/INT nanostructures were produced by laser ablation
of Pb-free powder. Therefore, the comprehensive role of Pb in the
synthesis is not fully understood at this time and requires further
investigation.

Surprisingly, the same reaction conditions yield
substantial amounts
of hollow closed structures of MoS2 and WS2 but
yet with dissimilar morphology. Although the outcome of the ablation
of MoS2 powder is fullerene-like NPs with acute corners,
multiwall nanotubes are the main product of the WS2 powder
ablation. On the one hand, it points out to the robustness of these
nanostructures, which have been previously attained using different
chemical strategies. The difference between the reaction products
of MoS2 and WS2 is possibly a manifestation
of the differences in their chemical stability. In the particular
case of MoS2, the ablated plume undergoes rapid oxidation
under the intense laser flux in air, whereas the resultant oxide is
rather volatile. Therefore, the IF-MoS2 NPs have possibly
been formed at the pristine surface left behind the ablated material.
It should be emphasized here that the intense laser beam excites a
large density of electrons, which eventually give rise to excess heat
upon transferring of their energy to the lattice via phonons. Additionally,
these photoexcited electrons can also provide a reducing local atmosphere
on the surface of the ablated sample. Thus, the ablated MoS2 plume, which resides in the close vicinity of the powder surface,
is protected against oxidation and can contribute to the buildup of
the IF-MoS2 NPs. On the contrary, WS2 is chemically
more stable and does not oxidize as easily as MoS2. Therefore,
the WS2 ablation plume is likely to be rich in WSx vapor, which condenses back onto the mother
tip of the tube protruding from the powder crystallites’ surface.
Experiments are under progress to monitor the evolution of each kind
of nanostructure upon variation of the irradiation parameters.

Large amounts of pure WS2 nanotubes’ phases were
obtained in the past by reacting WO3–x and H2S at temperatures as high as 800–900
°C. Several growth mechanisms have been proposed; consequently,
a distinction was made between type I and II23 formation processes. In the case of type I, the nanotubes grow spontaneously
at a high rate. Conversely, in the type II process, WO3–x nanowhiskers grow first and are subsequently substituted
chemically into WS2 nanotubes. This process is rather slow
(it takes a fraction of an hour) and is possibly not relevant to the
present experimental conditions. While type I tubes are narrow (up
to 40 nm), made of up to 10 walls, and are open ended, type II ones
exhibit large diameters (50–150 nm), are usually longer (2–20
μm), and usually have closed tips. In the production process
presented here, the situation is quite different. The ultrashort pulses
are heating the lattice via a photothermal process but at the same
time provide the energy to photochemically break the chemical bonds
between W and S and ablate the WS2 moieties,24 which subsequently give back the energy to the
environment and condense (Figure 10). This rapid process is analogous to the type I nanotube
growth. As expected, no oxide core was identified in the analysis.
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 7b, the tubes form a forest protruding perpendicular
to the substrate and exhibit quite uniform length. This growth mode
indicates an abrupt supply shortage of the plume, possibly via rapid
energy loss to the environment, once the nanotubes reach a critical
length. Although type I nanotubes are mostly grown under the conditions
used, TEM analysis revealed the presence of a fraction of type II
nanotubes in the ablated area. A direct comparison of the two types
is presented in Figure 9. Indeed, the nanotube shown in Figure 9a is akin to type I (few layers and a large-diameter
core), whereas that in Figure 9b is closer in shape to type II (many layers and a narrow
core). Furthermore, it was observed that the nanotubes with a large
diameter mostly exhibited a closed tip, whereas the narrower ones
showed an open tip. It can be concluded that the highly excited state
conditions formed under ultrafast laser excitation and subsequent
ablation give rise to growth processes, which are not necessarily
relevant to those observed in high-temperature oven-induced reactions.
Nonetheless, our finding that WS2 nanotubes of similar
structures can be produced, in similar or even higher yields compared
to those in the alternative approaches, under such entirely different
conditions is indicative of the robustness of this structural motif.

ultrashort laser pulses from the respective powder.

Conclusions
The synthesis of WS2 and MoS2 nanostructures
through ultrashort-pulse laser irradiation of the bulk material under
ambient conditions is demonstrated. It is shown that although this
method produces nanotubes in the case of WS2, irradiation
of MoS2 under identical conditions leads to IF-NPs. The
presented method is performed in ambient air and without use of any
toxic precursor gases, making it a simple and environmentally friendly
approach to obtaining high-quality inorganic nanostructures. Our results
suggest that one can use a scanning laser beam for the formation of
inorganic nanostructures at any preselected location and on temperature-sensitive
plastic substrates, which is destined to numerous applications, including
formation of miniaturized electronic devices or tips for electron
emission and scanning probe microscopy.

Experimental Procedures
Sample
Preparation and Laser Ablation
MoS2 (or WS2) powder was mixed with Pb powder, as the metal
catalyst, in a 1:1 molar ratio (11 g each). Substrates of Al were
sonicated in ethanol for 10 min. Using a silver paint, the mixed powder
was attached to the Al substrate. Pulsed laser ablation of the sample
was performed in ambient air. A second-harmonic Yb:KGW laser (513
nm, pulse duration 170 fs, pulse repetition rate 60 kHz, fluence =
5.3 W/mm2) was used for these experiments. The sample was
mounted on a computer-controlled motorized X–Y translation stage. During the irradiation, the sample
was scanned in two orthogonal directions (X and Y) in a fully controlled manner across the focused laser
beam in several spots for a duration of 1 min each. The estimated
number of laser pulses for each irradiation spot is 3.6 × 106. A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Figure 1.

Electron Microscopy
The samples were examined by different
electron microscopy techniques. SEM (JEOL 7000), equipped with an
EDS (INCA PentaFET-x3), was used for the analysis of the samples.
TEM was carried out with a Philips CM-120 instrument operating at
120 kV equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS). HRTEM
was performed with an FEI Technai F30-UT microscope operating at 300
kV. All powders that were analyzed by electron microscopy were dispersed
in ethanol, using an ultrasonic bath, and the suspension was dripped
on lacey carbon/Cu grids.
