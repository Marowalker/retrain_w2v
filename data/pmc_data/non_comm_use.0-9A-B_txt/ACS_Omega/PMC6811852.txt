Here, V2O5 was used to substitute Ta2O5 in SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) and SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 (SBTV)
ceramics were
formed. This study revealed that the substitution of Ta2O5 by V2O5 enhances the maximum
dielectric constant (εm), increases the transition
temperature, and reduces the sintering temperature of SBT ceramics.
The diffraction intensity of c-axis-preferred orientation
of SBTV ceramics increases with the increase in V2O5 concentration and sintering temperature. Disk-type grains
were observed in the SBTV ceramics at higher sintering temperatures.
By the Curie–Weiss law and modified Curie–Weiss law,
the phase transitions of the SBTV ceramics were discussed. The dielectric
properties of SBTV ceramics revealed that the relaxor-type ferroelectric
characteristics became more obvious than the normal-type ferroelectric
characteristics at high V2O5 concentrations
and sintering temperatures. Raman spectroscopy was successfully used
to study the lattice vibrational modes and structural transitions
of SBTV ceramics. The spectra proved that as V2O5 was added to SBTV ceramics the octahedral TaO6 and VO6 structures exhibited a high frequency mode.

Introduction
In recent years, ferroelectric
materials have gained popularity
for their application in nonvolatile memory devices.1,2 These materials particularly possess high permittivity, high piezoelectric
and pyroelectric coefficients, and reliable polarization switching.3 The leading candidate for this application is
PbZr1–xTixO3 (PZT) perovskite, which has a high Curie temperature
(TC) and large remanent polarization.
However, PZT ceramics exhibit serious polarization fatigue during
electric field cycling. Moreover, the release of harmful compounds
of Pb from electrical industries is an environmental hazard and some
implemented regulations such as waste from electrical and electronic
equipment, restriction of hazardous substances, and end-of-life vehicles
forbid the emission of harmful waste materials.4 More recently, a significant breakthrough in controlling
fatigue problems was reported in which ferroelectric materials belonging
to the layered perovskite family, such as SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) and BaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics, demonstrated no polarization fatigue during electric field
cycling.5

Based on their structure,
ferroelectric oxides may be classified
into four types: (1) perovskite, (2) pyrochlore, (3) tungsten bronze,
and (4) layer-type bismuth (Bi) compounds. In 1961, Smolenskii et
al. observed ferroelectricity in the series of Bi-layered perovskite
ABi2B2O9.6 As Bi-layered structure ferroelectrics serve a crucial role in dielectric
and ferroelectric devices, their crystal structure and material properties
have been investigated widely.7−9 Bi-layered pseudoperovskite SBT
ceramics have gained considerable attention as a promising ferroelectric
material and are a suitable lead-free alternative for PZT ceramics
in memory devices.10,11 The SBT crystal structure comprises
[Bi2O2]2+ layers and perovskite-type
[SrTa2O7]2– units with double
TaO6 octahedral layers. SBT ceramics provide a high fatigue
endurance, low switching voltage, and small polarization. However,
the low remanent polarization and high crystallization temperature
are the major drawbacks of SBT ceramics. Several studies have been
conducted to increase the polarization of SBT ceramics by doping various
cations at the A- and/or B-sites. SrBi2Ta2O9 belongs to the Aurivillius family of Bi-layered perovskites
with the general formula (Bi2O2)2+(Am–1BmO3m+1)2–, where m = 1–5. The substitution of A- and B-site cations
has a pronounced influence on the ferroelectric properties of SBT
ceramics.12

The substitution of Ca2+, Bi3+, Pr3+, Nd3+, and
La3+ with Sr2+, whose
radii are similar, at the A-site of SBT ceramics was widely investigated,
and considerable modification of the polarization properties was observed.
Pérez et al. reported the enhanced polarization properties
of Ca2+-substituted SBT compounds.13,14 Li et al. indicated that when Nd3+ is substituted into
the bismuth-layered perovskite structure of SBT by magnetron sputtering,
the remnant polarization (2Pr) improves and coercive field reduces.15 Coondoo et al. reported the addition of tungsten
(W) in SBT at the B-site to form SrBi2(Ta1–xWx)2O9 and observed effective improvement in the dielectric, electrical,
ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties.16

In this study, Ta2O5 substituted with
different
concentrations of V2O5 in SBT ceramics was used
to synthesize SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 (SBTV, x = 0.1–0.4) ceramics. By substituting Ta2O5 with V2O5 in SBT ceramics, SBTV ceramics
could be formed and the ferroelectric properties were enhanced.17 To study the effect of V2O5 content and sintering temperature on the microstructure, Raman characteristic
and normal- or relaxor-type characteristic of SBTV ceramics were investigated.
The results of Perez et al.,18 Zhu et al.,19 and Yu et al.20 have
indicated that Raman scattering is useful for exploring the microscopic
origin of ferroelectric materials because it is a sensitive technique
for investigating the lattice vibrational modes, which can indicate
the changes in the lattice vibrations and positions occupied by the
added ions. Dielectric characteristics of the normal- or relaxor-type
characteristic of SBTV ceramics were measured. The distinction between
normal-type ferroelectrics and relaxor-type ferroelectrics (RFE) can
be distinguished by three qualitatively different features in the
temperature dependence of the dielectric susceptibility. First, in
normal ferroelectrics, the real part dielectric constant (εr) shows a sharp narrow peak as a function of temperature (T), whereas the εr–T curves show a broad and rounded peak in the relaxor ferroelectrics.
Second, RFE is a strong frequency dependence in the peak position.
Last, the polarization in FE goes to zero at transition temperature
and in the relaxors the polarization extends well beyond the transition
temperature. Many researchers have reported that the Curie–Weiss
law and modified Curie–Weiss law may be used to describe diffusion
during phase transition. In this study, the Curie–Weiss law
and modified Curie–Weiss law were used to investigate the phase
transition between the characteristics of normal- and relaxor-type
ferroelectrics for the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 ceramics.

Results
and Discussion
The observed morphologies of the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 (SBTV)
ceramics sintered at 1020 °C with different V2O5 concentrations through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM)
are illustrated in Figure 1; grain growth was observed in all SBTV ceramics. Based on
the surface morphology of the SrBi2Ta1.9V0.1O9 (x = 0.1) ceramics presented
in Figure 1a, several
small anisotropic platelike grains were observed and the average aspect
ratio of the anisotropic platelike grains was approximately 6.67.
When the V2O5 concentration was increased to
0.2 (x = 0.2), the sizes of the anisotropic platelike
grains and the average aspect ratio of SrBi2Ta1.8V0.2O9 ceramics were slightly larger than those
of SrBi2Ta0.9V0.1O9 ceramics.
When the V2O5 concentrations were 0.3 and 0.4,
the SrBi2Ta1.7V0.3O9 and
SrBi2Ta0.6V0.4O9 ceramics
revealed anisotropic plate-type grains. Moreover, the average grain
size of the ceramics increased and the aspect ratio of the disk-type
grains increased from 8.05 to 8.72. The different aspect ratios of
the SBTV ceramics were caused by the addition of V2O5 because the low melting point of V2O5 acts as a liquid-phase-sintering aid and promotes the growth of
the (00l) planes.17 However,
the small voids or pores on the SrBi2Ta1.6V0.4O9 ceramics were more apparent compared with
those on the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 (x =
0.1-0.3) ceramics presented in Figure 1a–c. This result is caused by the upright anisotropic
plate-type grains that grow on the plane anisotropic plate-type SrBi2Ta1.6V0.4O9 ceramics. Moreover,
based on the results presented in Figure 1 and ref (21), the addition of V2O5 in
SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) ceramics can lower
the sintered temperature required to densify the SBT-based ceramics.

(a) x = 0.1, (b) x = 0.2, (c) x = 0.3 and (d) x = 0.4, respectively.

Figure 2 illustrates
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the SBTV ceramics with different
V2O5 concentrations; Figure 2a–c illustrates the characteristic
peaks of SBT (JCPDS no. 49-0609) ceramics. Only a single-phase layered
perovskite structure was observed in all SBTV ceramics, and no secondary
or unknown phases were detected. These results suggest that Ta5+ ions (Ta5+ = 0.64 Å) were completely substituted
by V5+ ions (V5+ = 0.54 Å) in the SBTV
ceramics. The XRD patterns of the SrBi2Ta1.6V0.4O9 ceramics revealed unknown phases. The
diffraction intensities of the (00l) planes increased
and those of the (111), (113), (115), (200), (206), (208), (220),
(224), (1113), and (315) planes slightly decreased with the increase
in V2O5 concentration. The (00l) planes observed at 2θ values of 21.4, 28.6, 35.9, 43.4, and
51.1° corresponded to the (006), (008), (0010), (0012), and (0014)
planes, respectively. The increase in the diffraction intensities
of SBTV ceramics with (008) and (0010) planes was more obvious. Huang
et al.17 found that the (00l) plane-preferred orientation of the layered perovskite in V2O5-doped SBT ceramics increased faster than the
orientation in nondoped SBT ceramics.20 This result was observed because V2O5 that
has a low melting point changes to the liquid phase during sintering
to promote a faster growth of the c-axis-preferred
orientation (00l) planes due to a high surface energy.22 Simultaneously, the formation of trace amount
of unknown phases in SrBi2Ta1.6V0.4O9 ceramics indicated that the crystal structure of layered
perovskite became defective. The unidentified phases maybe because
the V5+ ions did not occupy the Ta5+ sites in
the structure with higher V2O5 concentration.16

(a) x = 0.1, (b) x = 0.2, (c) x=0.3, and (d) x = 0.4.

The Raman spectra of SBTV ceramics with different V2O5 concentrations are shown in Figure 3. Raman bands at approximately 163, 210,
319, 356, 455, 600, 805, and 853 cm–1 were observed
in all SBTV ceramics. These characteristic bands agreed well with
those in other reports that presented characteristic bands at 163,
210, 600, and 805 cm–1, and the other weak bands
at 319, 356, and 455 cm–1.19,23,24 The Raman peaks at 805 and 853 cm–1 of SBTV ceramics corresponded to the TaO6 and B-site
substitution modes.18 The peak intensity
of SBTV ceramics at 853 cm–1 increased with the
increase in V2O5 concentration, and the TaO6 and VO6 octahedral structures exist in SBTV ceramics.
The substitution of V2O5 at Ta2O5 sites in the SBT ceramics apparently changes the high Raman
modes of SBTV ceramics. V2O5 is a pentavalent
compound and substitutes Ta2O5 sites inside
the octahedral cage. In the low Raman mode range, the SBTV ceramics
do not demonstrate any evident variation. However, only the 163.7
cm–1 band shifts to 165.3 cm–1, as shown in Figure 4. This result was caused by the replacement of Ta+5 ions
by the low-mass V+5 ions, and the substitution number of
V+5 ions increases with the increase in V2O5 concentration. The band at 163.7 cm–1 is
attributable to the vibration of the Ta+5 ion along the z direction (TO mode A1g),25 and the band at 210 cm–1 represents the
TO mode of SrO with a rock salt structure.26 The peaks at approximately 600 and 805 cm–1 are
associated with the internal vibration of the TaO6 octahedron.
However, the oxygen ions contributing to the two bands are different.
The vibration of the oxygen ions (O2) at the apex of the
TaO6 octahedron forms the 600 cm–1 band,
whereas the vibration of oxygen ions (O4, O5) in the TaO6 octahedron forms the 805 cm–1 band.

Figure 5 shows the
dielectric constant (εr) and loss tangent (tan  δ)
of the SBTV ceramics sintered at 1020 °C that are measured at
10 kHz, 100 kHz, and 1 MHz as a function of the measurement temperature.
The dielectric constant and loss tangent of the ferroelectric materials
in most cases depend on factors such as composition, grain size, and
secondary phases.14 As shown in Figure 5a–d, the dielectric
constants of the all SBTV ceramics increased with measurement temperature
and reached their maximum at the transition temperature. All ferroelectric
materials were characterized by a transition temperature known as
the Curie temperature, TC, at which the
dielectric constant exhibits a maximum value. The significantly enhanced
dielectric constant at high measurement temperatures may be due to
the mobile charge carriers, related to the oxygen vacancies. The oxygen
vacancies play a crucial role in the electrical polarization of perovskite
materials.27 The oxygen vacancy-induced
dielectric relaxation is considerably higher at higher measurement
temperatures than that at lower measurement temperatures. At low measurement
temperatures, the energy required to overcome the diffusion energy
barrier is insufficient and the oxygen vacancy-induced dielectric
relaxation is negligible. At high measurement temperatures, there
is sufficient energy and the contribution of the oxygen vacancy-induced
dielectric relaxation is substantial. Another valuable observation
is that the dielectric constants at low measurement temperatures were
the same, regardless of the frequencies used for the measurements,
whereas the dielectric constants at high temperatures varied considerably.
The aforementioned results imply that the mechanism contributes to
the dielectric polarization at high temperatures, but not at low temperatures.
Moreover, the transition temperature causes transition of the crystal
structure. At measurement temperatures higher than the transition
temperature, the SBTV exhibits a layered tetragonal structure. However,
below the transition temperature, the SBTV exhibits an orthorhombic
structure. For a given system, the tetragonal structure imposes a
lower activation energy compared with that of the orthorhombic or
other lower symmetric structure.28

constant curves of the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 ceramics as a
function of V2O5 contents. (a) x = 0.1, (b) x =
0.2, (c) x = 0.3, (d) x = 0.4.

The maximum dielectric constants of the SrBi2Ta0.9V0.1O9 ceramics measured
at 10 kHz,
100 kHz, and 1 MHz were 182, 161, and 153, respectively. The maximum
dielectric constant of the SrBi2Ta0.9V0.1O9 ceramics decreased with the increase in measured frequency.
The same phenomenon was observed in all SBTV ceramics because the
oxygen vacancy-induced polarization becomes more predominant at low
frequencies due to the inertia of oxygen ions. This explains the substantial
enhancement in the dielectric constants at low measurement frequencies.
Moreover, the maximum dielectric constants of the SBTV ceramics increased
as the V2O5 concentration increased from x = 0.1 to 0.3. As the same sintering temperature was used,
the crystallization and grain size of the SBTV ceramics for x = 0.3 is better than those of the SBTV ceramics for x = 0.2 and x = 0.1, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Because of the larger diffraction intensity of (0010) peak
and larger grain size of the SrBi2Ta0.7V0.3O9 ceramic as compared with those of the SrBi2Ta0.9V0.1O9 and SrBi2Ta0.8V0.2O9 ceramics. Therefore,
except for the effect of the lower melting temperature of V2O5, the effect of liquid-phase sintering caused by the
low-temperature eutectic in the SrO–V2O5 system is considered another reason for the improvement of crystallization
and grain growth.29 Because V2O5 concentration was x = 0.4, the maximum
dielectric constants of SrBi2Ta1.4V0.4O9 ceramics decreased slightly. Moreover, some small pores
were found in the SrBi2Ta1.4V0.4O9 ceramics, as shown in Figures 1d and 4d. This result is caused
by the growth of the upright anisotropic plate-type grains in the
plane anisotropic plate-type SrBi2Ta0.6V0.4O9 ceramics. Moreover, compared with those of
SBT ceramics, SBTV ceramics exhibit a higher maximum dielectric constant
and a lower sintering temperature at 1020 °C.30 This result can be demonstrated by the dielectric mixture
rule. The most commonly used dielectric mixture rule is Lichtenecker’s
equation31 1  where V is the volume fraction
and ε is the dielectric constant. This study assumed that the
pores of the volume fraction, V1 (dielectric
constant ε1 = 1), uniformly distributed in the matrix
of the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 ceramics. The volume fraction
of the SBTV ceramics is V2 (dielectric
constant ε2).

The transition temperature of
the SBTV ceramics as a function of
V2O5 concentration measured at 10 kHz, 100 kHz,
and 1 MHz is presented in Figure 6. The transition temperature of the SBT ceramic was
observed at 320 °C. The transition temperature of the SBTV ceramic
decreased slightly with the increase in measurement frequency. The
degree of reduction in the transition temperature of the SBTV ceramics
increased as the V2O5 concentration increased
from x = 0.1 to 0.3 and decreased as the V2O5 concentration increased from x = 0.3
to 0.4. Moreover, the transition temperature of the SBTV ceramics
shifted from 399 to 419 °C as the V2O5 concentration
increased from x = 0.1 to 0.3. Then, the transition
temperature shifted to low temperature from x = 0.3
to 0.4 at all measurement frequencies. The transition temperature
of the SBTV ceramics is higher than that of the SBT ceramics. In general,
in isotropic perovskite ferroelectrics, doping at the B-site (located
inside an oxygen octahedron) with smaller ions results in the shift
of the transition temperature to a higher measurement temperature,
thus leading to a larger polarization due to the enlarged “rattling
space” available for smaller B-site ions.32 In the current study, Ta5+ ions (Ta5+ = 0.64 Å) were completely substituted by V5+ ions
(V5+ = 0.54 Å) in the SBTV ceramics. As a larger amount
of V2O5 was used to substitute Ta2O5 in the SBT ceramics, the transition temperature was
higher. This result suggests that a higher V2O5 substitution at the Ta2O5 site in the SBT
ceramics shifts the transition temperature to a higher temperature.
The transition temperature also indicates enhanced polarizability,33,34 and this result confirms the aforementioned reason for the increase
in the maximum dielectric constants of the SBTV ceramics, as shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 6 Transition
temperature–frequency of the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 ceramics
as a function of V2O5 contents at different
frequencies.

The loss tangent of the SBTV ceramics
measured at 10 kHz, 100 kHz,
and 1 MHz as a function of measurement temperature is illustrated
in Figure 5. The loss
tangent of the SBTV ceramics rapidly increased at the measurement
temperature because the measurement temperature was higher than the
transition temperature. In particular, the change at 10 kHz was significantly
faster than that at 100 kHz and 1 MHz. V2O5 doping
in SBT ceramics increases loss tangent significantly. The dissipation
in ferroelectric materials occurs due to various reasons such as domain
wall relaxation, space charge accumulation at grain boundaries, dipolar
loss, and direct current conductivity.14 The presence of oxygen vacancies, which act as space charge and
contribute to the electrical polarization, can be attributed to the
loss tangent.35−37

To identify SBTV ceramics with the characteristics
of the normal-type
ferroelectric structure or relaxor-type ferroelectric structure, the
Curie–Weiss law and modified Curie–Weiss law were used
to analyze the εr–T curves. Figure 7 shows the plot of
the inverse dielectric constant versus the temperature for SBTV ceramics
at different V2O5 concentrations. The dielectric
constant of a normal-type ferroelectric higher than the Curie temperature
follows the Curie–Weiss law that is described as follows38 2  where T0 is the
Curie–Weiss temperature, C is the Curie–Weiss
constant, T is the measurement temperature, and T > TC. The degree of deviation
from the Curie–Weiss law can be defined using ΔTm as follows 3  where TCW denotes
the temperature at which the dielectric constant begins to deviate
from the Curie–Weiss law and Tm is the temperature corresponding to the maximum dielectric constant. TC is determined from the T–1/ε
by conducting extrapolation of the dielectric constant reciprocal
of the paraelectric region, and the values obtained are listed in Table 1. Figure 7 demonstrates three distinct
regions: the ferroelectric state at temperatures lower than Tm, the state in which polar clusters exist at
temperatures between Tm and TCW, and the paraelectric state at temperatures higher
than TCW. The modified Curie–Weiss
law has been proposed by many research groups to describe the diffusion
during a phase transition38 4  where γ and C′
are assumed to be constants. The γ value is between 1 and 2,
and gives information about the phase transition characteristic. The
γ values for normal-type ferroelectrics and ideal relaxor-type
ferroelectrics are 1 and 2, respectively.39,40Figure 8 represents
the plot of log(1/ε′ – 1/εm)
vs log(T – Tm)
for SBTV ceramics measured at 1 MHz. A linear relationship was observed
in the SBTV ceramics, and the slopes of the fitting curves determined
the γ value. After assigning the experimental data to the modified
Curie–Weiss law, the obtained γ values for SrBi2(Ta1.9V0.1)O9, SrBi2(Ta1.8V0.2)O9, SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9, and SrBi2(Ta1.6V0.4)O9 ceramics were 1.12, 1.35, 1.62, and
1.42, respectively. The γ values of the SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 ceramics at different V2O5 concentrations
were compared. The comparison results revealed that SrBi2(Ta1.9V0.1)O9 (γ = 1.12),
SrBi2(Ta1.8V0.2)O9 (γ
= 1.25), and SrBi2(Ta1.6V0.4)O9 (γ = 1.42) ceramics exhibit normal-type ferroelectric
characteristics and that SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 (γ = 1.62) ceramics relatively present the relaxor-type
ferroelectric characteristics.

To understand the sintering temperature
effect of the SBTV ceramics,
the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics were further investigated as a function of the sintering
temperature. The surface SEM images of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics are investigated
as a function of the sintering temperature, and the results are presented
in Figure 9. At a sintering
temperature of 940 °C, the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics revealed a porous structure and
no grain growth. When sintered at 960 °C, the morphology of the
SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics
revealed small square-shaped grains; the average grain size of the
SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics
increased gradually as the sintering temperature was increased from
960 to 980 °C. Several anisotropic platelike grains developed
at 1000 °C, and the aspect ratio of the anisotropic platelike
grains was 4.75 at this temperature. At higher sintering temperatures
(e.g., 1020 °C), the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics exhibited anisotropic platelike grains. The
average grain size of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics increased, and the aspect ratio of the disklike
grains increased to 8.05. These differences in the microstructures
of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics were observed due to the addition of V2O5 because the low melting point of V2O5 acts as a liquid-phase-sintering aid and causes rapid growth of
the (00l) planes.17 Zhang
et al. posited that SBT ceramics densify and shows the disklike grains
after sintering at 1280 °C for 3 h.21 By comparing the results presented in Figure 8d, it is evident that the addition of V2O5 in SBT ceramics can lower the temperatures required
to densify SBT-based ceramics.

Figure S1 shows the XRD patterns of
SBTV ceramics sintered at different temperatures. The XRD patterns
of SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics
exhibited the characteristic peaks of SBT (JCPDS no. 49-0609) ceramics.
As shown in Figure S1, only the single-phase
layered perovskite structure was present and no secondary or unknown
phases were detected, thus suggesting that V5+ ions completely
substituted Ta5+ ions in the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics. In the (00l) planes, the 2θ values of 21.4, 28.6, 35.9, 43.4, and 51.1°
corresponded to the (006), (008), (0010), (0012), and (0014) planes,
respectively. The increase in the diffraction intensities of SBTV
ceramics with (00l) planes was more obvious especially
when the sintered temperature was at 1000 and 1020 °C. This result
agrees with the SEM images presented in Figure 8. Huang et al. reported that with the increase
in sintering temperature the diffraction intensities of the preferred
orientation (i.e., (00l) planes) of the layered perovskite
V2O5-doped SBT ceramics increased faster than
those of the undoped SBT ceramics.17

Figure 10 shows
the measurement temperature dependence of the dielectric constant
at 1 MHz in SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O ceramics
at different sintering temperatures. All of the samples exhibit their
respective transition temperature. A shift in transition temperature
to high measurement temperatures and a corresponding increase in the
maximum dielectric constant values with the increase in sintered temperature
are observed. Here, the transition temperature of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics shifted to
a high measurement temperature due to the substitution of a higher
amount of Ta5+ ions with V5+ ions in the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics. Moreover,
the maximum dielectric constant of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics increased with an increase
in the degree of crystallinity (as shown in Figure 9). The dielectric constant of ferroelectric
materials in most cases is based on the composition and grain size.

The plot of log(1/ε′ – 1/εm)
vs log(T – Tm)
for SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics at different sintering temperatures measured at 1 MHz is
represented in Figure 11. A linear relationship is observed in the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics, and the slopes of
the fitting curves are used to determine the γ value. After
assigning the experimental data to the modified Curie–Weiss
law, the obtained γ values of SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics are 1.16, 1.25, 1.43, 1.54,
and 1.62 at sintering temperatures of 940, 960, 980, 1000, and 1020
°C, respectively. The γ values of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics at different sintering
temperatures were compared. The comparison results revealed that the
SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics
sintered at 1020 °C present relatively a higher number of relaxor-type
ferroelectric characteristics than normal-type ferroelectric characteristics.
The values are listed in Table S1.

– 1/εm)–log(T – Tm) plots of SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics at
different sintering temperatures (symbols, experimental data; solid
line, simulation data).

The sintering temperature
effects of the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics can be further explained
as follows. In the SBTV ceramics, oxygen vacancies could be generated
during the sintering process due to the presence of the reduced valence
state of vanadium ions. Although the partial substitution of Ta+5 with V+5 is intended at the B-sites of the layered
perovskite structure, V+4 may form and enter the crystal
structure. Two tetravalent vanadium ions entering the crystal structure
form one oxygen vacancy to maintain the electroneutrality, and the
overall reaction is given as follows: 5  where VÖ is the oxygen vacancy
with two effective positive charges and OOx is the oxygen ion at
an oxygen site with zero effective charge. According to thermodynamics,
sintering at low temperatures results in further oxidation of the
low-valence-state ions. When V is further oxidized during sintering
at temperatures from 940 to 980 °C in air, the SrBi2(Ta1.7V0.3)O9 ceramics takes oxygen
from air to fill the oxygen vacancy, thus leading to an evident decrease
in the oxygen vacancy-related dielectric relaxation. The contribution
of oxygen vacancy-induced dielectric relaxation to the dielectric
constant is considerably higher at high temperatures than that at
low temperatures, particularly below the paraferroelectric transition
temperature. Oxygen vacancy-induced dielectric relaxation is a diffusion-related
process, which is an activated process and is exponentially dependent
on temperature. At low temperatures, the energy required to overcome
the diffusion energy barrier is insufficient and the oxygen vacancy-induced
dielectric relaxation is negligible. When the ceramics are sintered
at high temperatures (1020 °C), the energy is sufficient to overcome
the diffusion energy barrier and the contribution of the oxygen vacancy
enhances the dielectric relaxation phenomenon.

Conclusions
SBTV
ceramics, which are a type of bismuth-layered perovskite ferroelectrics,
were successfully synthesized using the solid-state reaction method.
When the x value in the V2O5 concentration was in the range of 0.1–0.4 and ceramics was
sintered at 1020 °C, only disc-type grains were observed in the
surface SEM images. Compared with the SBT ceramics, the sintering
temperature for the grain growth and densification of SBTV ceramics
was decreased to a lower value. The XRD intensities of the (00l) planes increased with the V2O5 concentration
from x = 0.1 to 0.3, and the preferential orientation
phenomenon (c plane) was confirmed. The modified
Curie–Weiss law revealed that SBTV ceramics sintered at 1020
°C exhibited normal-type ferroelectric characteristics for the
V2O5 concentrations with x =
0.1, 0.2, and 0.4, and an incline to relaxor-type ferroelectric characteristics
was obtained for the V2O5 concentration with x = 0.3. Compared with those of SBT ceramics, the higher
dielectric constants and transition temperature of SBTV ceramics were
attributable to the partial substitution of Ta5+ ions by
a smaller amount of V5+ ions at the B-sites. Moreover,
the substitution of V5+ at the Ta5+ site of
SBT ceramics to form SBTV ceramics presented an evident influence
on the BO6 mode, as confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy
results.

Experimental Section
The investigated ceramic compositions
were as follows: SrBi2(Ta2–xVx)O9 (SBTV) with x = 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, and 0.4. The SBTV ceramics were prepared using the solid-state
reaction method based on the following chemical reaction 6  For substitution
of Ta2O5 by V2O5, the
equation was modified as follows 7  Reagent-grade
SrCO3, Bi2O3, Ta2O5, and V2O5 powders (purity, >99.5%)
were mixed for 2 h in polyethylene
bottles containing zirconia balls and deionized water. The obtained
slurry was then dried and ground. The powder obtained after drying
and grinding was calcined at 850 °C for 3 h. Based on the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis results, the calcined powder revealed a
single-layered perovskite structure. The SBTV powder was uniaxially
pressed in a steel die with a diameter of 12 mm to form compact disks.
These pellets were sintered at different temperatures for 4 h in air.

The phase identification of SBTV ceramics was conducted through
XRD with 1.54 Å Cu Kα radiation, and the microstructure
of SBTV ceramics was observed through scanning electronic micrography
(SEM). Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze the SBTV ceramics by
a 532 nm YAG laser, which was operated at a 100 mW power. A laser
with a beam diameter of approximately 2 μm was focused on the
surface of SBTV ceramics by a 1000× objective lens. Before the
dielectric characteristic of the SBTV ceramics were analyzed, the
Ag–Pd paste was applied on the surface of the ceramics and
sintered at 600 °C as electrodes. An LCR meter (model HP4294A)
measured the temperature-dependent dielectric constant (εr) and loss tangent (tan  δ) of the SBTV ceramics
in a temperature-programmable testing chamber.
