The
reaction of molybdenum(II) and chromium(II) acetates with squaric
acid in degassed and deionized water under hydrothermal conditions
at 150 °C is described. The products have been formulated as
M2(μ-OH)2(μ-C4O4)2(H2O)4·2H2O, where
M = Cr (1) and Mo (2), based on combustion
elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, magic angle spinning (MAS)
solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and single-crystal
X-ray diffraction. The edge-shared bioctahedral structures involve
doubly bridging hydroxide ligands and μ-squarate ligands. The
chromium compound lacks a direct metal–metal-bonding interaction,
while in contrast the molybdenum compound contains a Mo–Mo
bond [2.491(2) Å]. The nature of the Mo–Mo-bonding interaction
is compared with that of other similar d3–d3 dimers.

Introduction
As part of our search
for metal–organic framework (MOF)-type
materials containing metal–metal multiple bonds,1−7 we have been investigating the reaction of quadruply bonded chromium(II)
and molybdenum(II) compounds with simple diprotic carboxy acids, such
as oxalic acid or squaric acid.3 Chisholm
and Cotton have shown that it is possible to link quadruply bonded
dinuclear units using bridging oxalate and squarate ligands, to form
dimers of dimers that facilitate varying degrees of electronic communication
through the π-system of the carboxy anion linker.2,3,7 Therefore, we reasoned that it
may be possible to prepare two-dimensional polymeric species containing
metal–metal quadruple bonds linked by squarate, which might
have interesting electrical conducting properties.1 Unfortunately, the compounds we have obtained thus far
and described in this paper are more like traditional molecular species
and do not fit the typical description of an MOF-type material. However,
the products are of interest from a theoretical point of view with
respect to the electronic structure of transition-metal complexes
and the nature of metal–metal-bonding interactions.2 In addition, this work points out the limitations
of the hydrothermal synthetic approach, which generally produces the
most thermodynamically stable product, rather than kinetically stable
materials that might be produced under less thermally demanding conditions.4

Results and Discussion
We have investigated
the reaction of chromium(II) acetate dihydrate
and molybdenum(II) acetate with squaric acid under anaerobic hydrothermal
reaction conditions. We obtained an air-stable, light dichroic purple/green
crystalline material in the case of chromium and an air-stable, light
green/brown crystalline material in the case of molybdenum. The empirical
formula of these products is best characterized as MC4H7O8 [M = Cr (1) and Mo (2)] based on combustion elemental analysis. This formulation requires
the metal atoms to have undergone a one-electron oxidation per metal
atom. The compounds were sparingly soluble and relatively stable in
degassed deionized (DI) water and dimethylformamide (DMF), but virtually
insoluble in organic solvents such as methanol, acetone, diethyl ether,
dichloromethane, and hexane. The KBr pellet infrared spectrum clearly
indicates the presence of both squarate and hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl
groups and/or water. Compound 1 appears to be the same
as the product obtained by other investigators, in which chromium(III)
starting materials were reacted with excess squaric acid, forming
the dinuclear species Cr2(OH)2(C4O4)2(H2O)4·2H2O.8,9 We have also been able to prepare 1 by exposure of chromium(II) squarate hydrate to air10 and have been able to prepare 2 from potassium octachlorodimolybdate,2 using the hydrothermal approach. Similar tungsten hydroxide formamidinate
complexes have been prepared by the serendipitous exposure of quadruply
bonded ditungsten tetraformamidinate compounds to air and moisture.11 We cannot rule out the possibility that the
metal ions reduce the squaric acid during preparation.12

We have been able to characterize both 1 and 2 by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and
have found that
they adopt similar structures (Figure 1), with one major difference. Both adopt edge-shared
bioctahedral structures, in which there are bridging hydroxide ligands
between the metal atoms. The trans-squarate ligands bridge the two
metal atoms to form a six-membered ring, rather than coordinating
to a single metal atom, which would result in a five-membered ring
with significant ring strain and an unfavorable bite angle. We note
that squarate is a versatile ligand, having a wide variety of coordination
modes.13,14 Both 1 and 2 have
four terminally ligated water molecules, resulting in roughly D2h symmetry, which is lowered by the presence
of the additional waters of crystallization. We were unable to locate
all of the hydrogen atoms in the difference map of 2,
but have included a computer-generated approximation for the hydrogen-bonding
interactions in Figure 1. The structure of 1 is consistent with that observed
by Chesick and Doany.15 The major difference
between the structures of 1 and 2 is the
distance between the metal atoms and the subsequent effect on bond
angles. The Cr–Cr distance (3.0 Å) is typical for a chromium(III)
paramagnetic dimer having antiferromagnetic coupling.16−18 In contrast, the Mo–Mo distance in 2 is significantly
shorter [2.491(2) Å] and consistent with a diamagnetic compound
having a metal–metal bond, which causes a decrease in the Mo(1)–O(4)–Mo(1′)
angle, 74.9(1)°, for the bridging hydroxide ligands, as compared
with the same angle in 1, 128.6(1)°. In addition,
the trans-squarate O(1)–Mo(1)–O(5′) angles of
172(1)° versus 160.9(1)° for 1 and 2, respectively, are consistent with a distortion that would occur
due to the presence of the Mo–Mo bond and the relatively large
bite angle of the inflexible squarate ligand [O(1)–C(2)–C(1),
134.0(4)°]. Similar to what was previously observed for 1, the C–O bond lengths for the squarate in 2 are approximately 0.03 Å longer when the oxygen atoms are coordinated
to the molybdenum atoms than the C–O bond lengths for the oxygen
atoms that are not coordinated to the metal atoms. The latter are
involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions with water molecules. There
are no significant differences between the C–O and C–C
bond lengths within the squarate ligands for 1 as compared
with 2, suggesting that any π back-bonding from
metal-based d-orbitals into the C–O π* orbitals and carbon
ring is not significantly altered by the presence of the metal–metal
bond. The Mo–O bond lengths for the squarate ligands, the bridging
hydroxide ligands, and the coordinated water molecules are all remarkably
similar (avg. 2.09 ± 0.06 Å)19 and slightly longer than the average Cr–O bond lengths (avg.
1.97 ± 0.02 Å), consistent with the increased ionic radius
of molybdenum. The relative Mo–O bond lengths follow the order
squarate, which is less than the bridging hydroxide, followed by coordinated
waters, consistent with the relative charge interactions.

We have also measured the solid-state carbon-13
magic angle spinning
nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectrum of a powdered sample
of 2 and have observed two well-resolved signals at 192.0
and 194.7 ppm, with a nearly 1:1 integral ratio,20 consistent with a diamagnetic species, with approximate D2h symmetry. We would like to assign the former
signal to the proximal carbons and the latter signal to the distal
carbons, respectively, based on comparison with the reported solid-state
data for squaric acid.21 The chemical shifts
for squaric acid were observed at 187.4 and 194.1 ppm, with the former
being attributed to the hydroxyl carbons and the latter being attributed
to the carbonyl carbons. We suggest that the proximal carbon in 2 experiences a deshielding effect, as compared to the hydroxyl
carbons of squaric acid, while the distal carbonyl in 2 appears to be very similar to the carbonyls in squaric acid and
is minimally affected by coordination to the Mo2(μ-OH)22+ unit. This is
consistent with a slight withdrawal of electron density from the squarate,
due to columbic interactions with the metal ion and minimal π-back-bonding
from the metal d-orbitals that form the metal–metal bond. This
would also be consistent with the observed solution carbon-13 NMR
spectra, recorded in H2O/D2O, in which a single
time-averaged signal was observed for squaric acid at 195.3 ppm, while
the sodium squarate signal was observed at 204.2 ppm. The time-averaged
solution chemical shift compares well with the chemical shifts of
the solid-state MAS signals that we have observed for sodium squarate
(see the Supporting Information). It should
also be noted that an increase in ring size in going from squarate,
to croconate (189.3 ppm), to rhodizonate (174.2 ppm) resulted in a
shielding effect in which the C–O bonds become less polarized.22

A number of dinuclear molybdenum and tungsten
d3–d3 compounds having edge-shared bioctahedral
structures are
known and have been found to have metal–metal bond lengths
ranging from 2.35 to 2.8 Å.23 Furthermore,
Zubieta and co-workers have described a series of Mo2O4(C4O4)L4 compounds, where
L = pyridine and 3,5-lutidine, that adopt edge-shared bioctahedral
structures having Mo–Mo single bonds with an average distance
of 2.55 Å.24 The nature of the metal–metal
bonding in these compounds can be complicated.25 In some cases, the d3–d3 dimers
can be described as a relatively weak triple bond, having a σ2π2δ2 configuration, where
the sideways overlap of dx2–y2 orbitals forming the δ-bond does
not contribute to a significant attractive force between the metal
atoms. This type of metal–metal triple bond is generally longer
than unbridged triple bonds having σ2π4 configurations, whose bond lengths range from 2.2 to 2.4
Å.2 However, it has been argued that,
in some examples of edge-shared bioctahedra, ligand–metal π
interactions can destabilize the δ-orbital, resulting in a formal
metal–metal single bond, with a σ2π2δ*2 configuration, where the antibonding
character of the δ* orbital minimally cancels some of the metal–metal-bonding
interactions.

In an effort to get a sense of the electron configuration
in our
d3–d3 dimolybdenum hydroxy squarate complex,
we have performed density functional theory molecular orbital (DFT
MO) calculations. The unrestricted calculations produce an energetically
minimized structure that is a very good approximation of the observed
structure, with a calculated Mo–Mo distance of 2.415 Å.3 We have deposited a figure in the Supporting Information, showing an overlapping
plot of the experimentally observed X-ray structure and the calculated
structure. The only significant difference between these structures
is the position of the hydrogen atoms for the coordinated water molecules,
which is presumably due to slight differences in the energy minimum
resulting from the hydrogen-bonding interactions in the solid-state
structure. Figure 2 shows a picture of the resulting highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO, au) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO,
b2g). It is evident that the HOMO primarily represents
the Mo–Mo δ* orbital, with minor antibonding contributions
from the squarate ligand orbitals, while the LUMO primarily represents
the Mo–Mo δ orbital, also with antibonding contributions
from the squarate ligand orbitals. However, the LUMO has significant
π-antibonding interactions with the oxygen lone-pair orbitals
on the bridging hydroxide ligands, which energetically destabilizes
this MO. This suggests that the best description for the metal–metal
bond is a formalized single bond with a σ2π2δ*2 configuration. As we have observed, this
electron configuration should result in a relatively long, formal
Mo–Mo single bond, comparable with the Mo–Mo single
bond distances reported by Zubieta et al. for the Mo2O4(C4O4)L4 compounds, which
are Mo(V)–Mo(V) dimers.24

Figure 2 (a) HOMO (−4.639
eV) and (b) LUMO (−4.094 eV) of 2 appearing perpendicular
to the virtual plane of symmetry
that includes the squarate ligands.

Weak antiferromagnetic interactions for edge-shared bioctahedral
chromium dimers can be rationalized based on the relatively small
radial extension of the d-orbitals, making the formation of metal–metal
bonds less thermodynamically favorable. Poli and Gordon26 have discussed the competing factors for edge-shared
bioctahedral halide phosphine compounds for the group VI metals, highlighting
the preference for metal–metal-bonded structures in the molybdenum
and tungsten compounds. The stabilization of the nonbonded structures
for chromium was rationalized based on preferable coulombic metal–ligand
interactions and exchange interactions involving the three unpaired
electrons per metal atom located in the t2g-type d-orbitals.27

Conclusions
In summary, the reaction
of quadruply bonded M2(O2CCH3)4, where M = Cr or Mo, with an
excess of squaric acid under hydrothermal conditions, results in a
product formulated as M2(μ-OH)2(μ-C4O4)2(H2O)4·2H2O. Both compounds adopt similar edge-shared bioctahedral structures,
but the metal–metal bond distances indicate that the chromium
complex has a nonbonded antiferromagnetic interaction, whereas the
molybdenum complex is diamagnetic with a metal–metal single
bond of σ2π2δ*2 configuration.

Experimental Section
General Methods
Starting materials and solvents were
either purchased from VWR or prepared by slight variations of literature
methods, as described in the Supporting Information.

Infrared spectra were recorded as potassium bromide pellets,
by grinding small portions of sample with a few milligrams of KBr
in air, using an agate mortar and pestle, and pressed using a stainless
steel Little-Press nut-and-bolt-type pellet die kit. The spectroscopy-grade
KBr was purchased from VWR. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer.
A background spectrum of air was subtracted to produce the sample’s
percent transmittance spectrum. Residual gaseous carbon dioxide asymmetric
vibrations were often observed in the 2400 cm–1 region,
due to incomplete background subtraction. The spectrometer’s
calibration was regularly checked using a film of polystyrene. Solid-state
carbon-13 NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-III-HD spectrometer
using a double-resonance 4 mm HR-MAS probe, by collecting ∼4k
scans, at a spin rate of 13 kHz and a temperature of 298 K, with an
interpulse delay of 15 s. The sample was ground to a fine powder using
an agate mortar and pestle, packed into a rotor, fitted with a cap,
and mounted in the MAS device. Spinning sidebands were observed and
confirmed as sidebands, by altering the spin rate. Combustion elemental
analyses were performed by Atlantic Microlabs Inc., using standard
procedures for air-stable inorganic compounds. Details of the DFT
calculations can be found in the Supporting Information. The X-ray crystallographic data has been submitted to the Cambridge
Structural Database.

Synthesis of 1
A typical
synthesis involved
placing chromium(II) acetate hydrate (0.135 g, 0.359 mmol) and slightly
greater than 2 equiv of squaric acid (0.085 g, 0.745 mmol) in the
Teflon liner of an autoclave, which was then placed in a glovebag
along with a squirt bottle filled with degassed DI water. The bag
was filled with ultra high purity (UHP) nitrogen, several times, to
displace the air. Approximately 25 mL of the freshly degassed water
was added, and the lid was placed on a Teflon container, which was
then removed from the glovebag and sealed in the stainless steel jacket
of an autoclave. The autoclave was placed in a laboratory convection
oven at 150 °C for 24 h. After slowly cooling the autoclave to
room temperature, the liner was removed and opened in air. The solution
was vacuum-filtered using a preweighed medium-porosity sintered glass
Buchner funnel and washed with several portions of DI water, acetone,
and diethyl ether. After drying in vacuo for several hours, the mass
of purple crystals was 0.120 g, 71.3% yield. Combustion elemental
analysis was based on an empirical formula of CrC4H7O8, theoretical C = 20.43% and H = 3.00%, found
C = 20.31% and H = 3.09%, and IR data (KBr cm–1)
1795 (vw), 1620 (m), and 1502 (vs), as well as broad O–H stretches
at 3000–3500 (m).

Synthesis of 2
A procedure
similar to
the synthesis of 1 was used, in which molybdenum(II)
acetate (0.501 g, 1.17 mmol) was combined with squaric acid (0.271
g, 2.38 mmol), producing 0.551 g of yellow/green-brown crystals, 84.3%
yield. Combustion elemental analysis was based on an empirical formula
of MoC4H7O8, theoretical C = 17.22%
and H = 2.53%, found C = 17.20% and H = 2.46%, and IR data (KBr cm–1) 1801 (w), 1618 (m), and 1506 (vs), as well as broad
hydrogen-bonded O–H stretches at 3450 (m) and 3150 (m).

what we believe to be CrC4O4·4H2O, based on combustion elemental analysis, theoretical C = 20.34%
and H = 3.42%, found C = 20.41% and 20.47% and H = 3.15% and 3.20%.
However, this analysis is difficult to distinguish from 1. We have prepared this material by zinc reduction of chromium(III)
chloride to a blue Cr2+ (aq) solution, followed by addition
of squaric acid. Exposure of aqueous suspensions of this material
to air, with heating, produces purple 1.
