A new nano-ordered 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate-1,3-propylene
covalently functionalized MCM-41 (MCM-41-Pr-THEIC) was designed and
prepared at room temperature through a simple procedure. According
to various microscopic, spectroscopic, or thermal methods and techniques,
the correlation of the catalytic performance of the hybrid mesoporous
MCM-41-Pr-THEIC to its structural characteristics was fully confirmed.
The new MCM-41-Pr-THEIC organosilica nanomaterials were successfully
investigated as a solid mild nanocatalyst through hydrogen-bonding
activation provided by its organic moiety, for the pseudo-four-component
condensation of dimedone, aldehydes, and ammonium acetate or p-toluidine to afford the corresponding acridinedione derivatives
under green conditions. Furthermore, the introduced nanocatalyst could
be reused at least four times with negligible loss of its activity,
indicating the good stability and high activity of the new hybrid
organosilica.

Introduction
Organocatalysis has been emerged as an
environmental and cost-effective
alternative pathway to the traditional transition-metal catalysis
for fine chemical synthesis especially in pharmaceutical industry
over recent decades.1−9 Perfect homogeneous organocatalyst must be available through easy
synthetic procedures and are often composed of nontoxic small organic
compounds that can be easily degraded in the environment without significant
waste generation.5,10−13 However, the usual workup remains
a major drawback with tedious and costly procedures for separation
of the homogeneous organocatalysts from the reaction mixture. On the
other hand, heterogeneously catalyzed procedures have a valuable role
in simplification of the processes and decreasing environmental concerns,
including less corrosion, simple separation, catalysts recovery, and
avoiding the usage of hazardous solvents.14−16 To achieve
more sustainable catalytic progresses by improving the yield and energy
efficiency, recent contributions have also been focused on immobilized
organocatalysts onto the surface of solid polymeric supports, in particular
silica.17−24 The structure of the obtained organosilica materials is sufficiently
attractive and tunable to combine the advantages of a silica matrix,
including high surface area, thermal or mechanical stability, as well
as chemical inertness with the properties of the grafted organic moieties.22,25−32 Hence, mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM) with very large specific
surface areas (up to 2000 m2 g–1) and
tunable pore radius from approximately 2–50 nm as well as mechanically
stable structure have become a new possible candidate for sensors,33 adsorbents,34−36 drug-delivery systems,35,37,38 and CO2 capture or
transformation,39,40 as well as solid supports to
immobilize homogeneous catalysts41−46 or directly use them as an ideal heterogeneous catalyst alone.47−53

On the other hand, multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have received
great interest from synthetic, environmental, and economical points
of view in recent years, especially for the synthesis of heterocycles
with high diversity such as acridinedione derivatives.45,54−62 These tricyclic N-containing heterocycles have
received a lot of interest as one of the most important classes of
heterocyclic scaffolds in the biologically active molecules research.
A series of acridinediones containing aromatic substituents are generally
known as antibacterial or antiparasitic agents that are capable of
intercalating into DNA base pairs.63 Furthermore,
there are several pharmacological properties associated with these
compounds, including antimalarial,64 antifungal,65 anticancer,66 or
GCN5 inhibitor67 properties as well as
selective flouride-ion chemosensor68 and
fluorescence enhancement.69 Due to the
biological importance of the acridinedione derivatives, synthesis
of these compounds is an interesting research challenge for both organic
and medicinal chemists.70,71 Literature survey shows
that several modified methods for the pseudo-four-component Hantzsch-type
condensation of aromatic aldehydes, dimedone, and different nitrogen
sources, including urea, methyl amine, aniline, or ammonium acetate,
have been reported using different catalytic systems by the traditional
heating in organic solvents72 or under
microwave irradiation.73,74 Recently, ZnII doped
and immobilized on functionalized magnetic hydrotalcite,75 platinum nanoparticles supported on graphene
oxide or its reduced form,76 carboxylic
acid-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes,77 TiO2-coated magnetite nanoparticle-supported
sulfonic acid,78,79 sulfuric acid-modified poly(vinylpyrrolidone),80 SnCl4-functionalized nano-Fe3O4-encapsulated silica,13 Eu2O3-modified CeO2 nanoparticles,81 Vitamin B1,82 morpholinium-based ionic liquids,68 and
choline chloride:urea83 have been described.
Although various protocols for the synthesis of acridinedione derivatives
have been reported, the use of solid mild materials with simpler experimental
setup; lower toxicity, corrosion, or cost; and environmental tolerability
is still in demand. At present, it is worth using highly thermally
stable, cost-effective, and milder catalytic systems for different
organic transformations. In continuation of our ongoing efforts toward
expanding efficient and novel heterogeneous catalysts for different
MCRs,29,84−89 we wish herein to report the preparation and characterization of
1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate covalently functionalized MCM-41
(MCM-41-Pr-THEIC, 1) nanocatalyst and examination of
its catalytic activity for the pseudo-four-component condensation
reaction of dimedone (2), different aldehydes 3, and ammonium acetate (4a) or p-toluidine
(4b) to afford the corresponding Hantzsch acridinedione
derivatives 5–6 under mild conditions
in high to excellent yields and short reaction times (Scheme 1). This nanocatlyst can be
considered as a typical example of mild heterogeneous catalysts which
activate the substrates and intermediates during the catalytic cycle
through hydrogen bonding provided by its organic moiety as well as
inorganic silica support whose polarity has been appropriately balanced.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no report for the use of 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate
grafted on the surface of MCM-41 by 1,3-propylene linker (MCM-41-Pr-THEIC)
as a heterogeneous organocatalyst, for different MCRs including Hantzsch
acridinedione derivatives 5 or 6.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the Covalently Modified Nano-Ordered MCM-41
Using 1,3-Dibromopropane and THEIC (MCM-41-Pr-THEIC, 1)
Initially, the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC materials (1) were prepared by grafting of the 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate
to the surface of the nano-ordered MCM-41 using 1,3-dibromopropne,
as an appropriate and inexpensive linker (Scheme 1). The surface and bulk properties of the
new catalyst were studied by several techniques such as Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry, energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectroscopy, and CHN elemental analysis.

The preparation
of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC materials (1) and their structure
were approved by FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra of MCM-41 (a),
MCM-41-PrBr (b), MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1, c), MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
after four times of recycling (d), and THEIC (e) are compared in Figure 1. It is generally
approved that high-intensity bands at 1180–1278 cm–1 are due to the asymmetrical Si–O external stretching vibrations
and those at 1000–1100 cm–1 are due to the
internal vibrations.90 Moreover, the signals
appearing at 1689 and 1471 cm–1 are attributed to
the stretching vibrations of the isocyanurate ring. Also, the observed
characteristic bands at 3200–3400 cm–1 are
attributed to the stretching vibration of the O–H bonds of
both MCM-41 and THEIC.

(1, c), MCM-41-Pr-THEIC after four times of recycling
(d),
and THEIC (e).

The field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) images
illustrated in Figure 2a–f reveal the general morphology of MCM-41 and MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1). As it can be found from the FESEM images of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1, Figure 2d–f), the morphological structure of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) materials is different from that of the pure MCM-41; moreover,
the particles size of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) is slightly
higher than that of pure MCM-41 (12.1–16.5 nm). On the other
hand, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images shown in Figure 3 confirms the presence
of 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate grafted to the 1,3-propylene
linker in the channels of the nanosized MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) sample compared to pure MCM-41.91,92

of the MCM-41 (a–c) and the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1) nanomaterials (d–f).

Figure 3 TEM images of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) nanomaterials.

The thermal stability of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC nanomaterials
(1) was also investigated using the thermogravimetric
analysis
(TGA) technique (Figure 4). The TGA curve of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) shows three
steps of weight loss. The 7% weight loss in the first step corresponds
to desorption of physiosorbed water or solvent molecules held in the
pores of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1). Furthermore, the sharp
46% weight loss in the second step (between 200 and 400 °C) can
be mainly attributed to the decomposition of 2-hydroxyethyl moiety
existing in the structure of THEIC or 1,3-propylene linker in the
nanomaterial 1 framework. On the other hand, the slight
13% weight loss at >400 °C was related to the decomposition
of
thermally stable isocyanurate ring located on the surface of MCM-41
channels.29,86,93,94 These results also indicate that 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate
has been successfully grafted onto the surface of MCM-41.95

The CHN analysis of functionalized MCM-41 with
THEIC 1 was also used to quantify the organic molecules
anchored to its
surface. The percentage of nitrogen was observed to be 2.46%w. This
means that loading of the 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate per
gram of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) is about 0.59 mmol. Furthermore,
EDX analysis of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) clearly confirmed
the presence of C, N, O, and Si (Figure 5). These findings, especially the presence
of nitrogen and absence of halogen impurity in the composition of
the nanomaterials 1, demonstrate grafting of the 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)
isocyanurate onto the surface of the MCM-41 matrices. Indeed, EDX
and CHN analyses show a good agreement with those data obtained in
TGA as well as FESEM and TEM images, which strongly confirm the successful
functionalization of inorganic MCM-41 by the 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate
organic moiety.

the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1) materials.

On the other hand, Figure 6 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1). It is obvious that the characteristic highly ordered
uniform hexagonal mesopores of MCM-41 still exist in the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1) nanomaterials (Figure 6, top). Furthermore, other peaks in the high-angle
region of the XRD pattern can be attributed to the presence of 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate
covalently grafted through the 1,3-propylene linker onto the surface
of MCM-41 (Figure 6, down).

As shown in Figure 7, the adsorption–desorption isotherm of the
MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1) sample corresponds to a type V isotherm with H2 hysteresis
loop according to the classification of Brunauer, Deming, Deming,
and Teller. It is generally accepted that there is a correlation between
the shape of the hysteresis loop and the texture (e.g., pore size
distribution, pore geometry, and connectivity) of a mesoporous material.96 Indeed, grafting of THEIC groups through 1,3-propylene
linker onto the surface of pore walls of MCM-41 can block them, leading
to the decrease of surface area and broad pore distribution.

Investigation of the Catalytic Activity of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) for the Synthesis of Acridinediones 5–6
To evaluate the catalytic activity of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
(1) for the synthesis of acridinediones 5–6, the pseudo-four-component condensation of
4-chlorobenzaldehyde (3a, 1.0 mmol), dimedone (2, 2.0 mmol), and ammonium acetate (4a, 1.2 mmol)
or p-toluidine (4b, 1.0 mmol) was investigated
as the model reaction. In a systematic study, the effects of several
crucial variables such as solvent and temperature, catalyst loading,
and reaction time were studied. The results are summarized in Table 1. In the first step,
to optimize the reaction conditions, a variety of solvents and temperatures
were screened in the model reaction. In the absence of any solvent,
the model reaction was slow and the yield of the desired product 9-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-3,4,6,7,9,10-hexahydroacridine-1,8(2H,5H)-dione (5a) was low to
moderate, even at 120 °C and after 1.5 h (Table 1, entry 1). The model reaction was then studied
in solvents such as H2O, EtOH, MeOH, THF, EtOAc, CH3CN, EtOH/H2O (1:1), EtOH/H2O (2:1),
and EtOH/H2O (1:2) using MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) 20 mg loading (entries 2–14). The results clearly indicated
that the model reaction did not proceed substantially at room temperature
(Table 1, entries 2,
8, and 10). Interestingly, higher yield of the desired product 5a was obtained in EtOH/H2O (1:2) under reflux
conditions (Table 1, entry 15). Encouraged by this result, the model reaction was examined
in EtOH/H2O (1:2) under reflux conditions using different
amounts of catalyst loading (entries 15–19). To our delight,
it was found that 15 mg of catalyst 1 was sufficient
to promote the model reaction efficiently (entry 15). On the other
hand, to demonstrate the synergic impact of hydroxyl functional groups
of MCM-41 and 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate on the catalytic
activity of nanomaterial 1, the catalytic performances
of MCM-41, MCM-41-PrBr, or 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate
were also examined under the same reaction conditions (Table 1, entries 20–22). Indeed,
the results strongly confirmed the role of all MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) components to promote the synthesis of acridinedione 5a. Therefore, MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1, 15 mg) in
EtOH/H2O (1:2, 2 mL) under reflux conditions as the optimized
reaction conditions were developed to other aromatic aldehydes (3b–j) for the synthesis of a wide range
of the desired products 5–6. The
results are summarized in Table 2.

b All products, except 6J, are known and their structures were established from their spectral
data and melting points compared to authentic samples or literature
values.

c Isolated yields
were reported.

The obtained results showed that aldehydes 3 having
an electron-withdrawing group on their aromatic ring generally reacted
faster or afforded higher yields compared to those with an electron-donating
group. It is also significant that even ortho-substituted
benzaldehydes, considering their intrinsic steric hindrance, afforded
the desired products in high yields under optimized conditions. These
observations strongly approve the appropriate catalytic activity of
MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) to promote the Hantzsch pseudo-four-component
reaction of different aldehydes 3, dimedone (2), and nitrogen sources 4a–b.

According to the obtained results, the above mechanism can be proposed
for the synthesis of acridinediones 5–6 catalyzed by MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) through the MCR strategy
(Scheme 2). In the
first step, MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) activates the carbonyl
functional group of both dimedone (2) and aldehydes 3, through hydrogen bonding made by hydroxyl groups of THEIC
or silanol groups on the surface of MCM-41, to form the corresponding
Knoevenagel intermediate (II). This intermediate is further
activated by MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) to be involved for the
next Michael addition of the enol form of dimedone 2.
The next step comprises the formation of intermediate IV from the second equivalent of dimedone 2. Then, one
of the keto functional groups in the intermediate IV is
activated by MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) to react with the ammonia
source 4 affording imine intermediate V.
The cyclization between enamine and keto functional group, followed
by proton transfer, and finally elimination of third H2O molecules affords the desired acridinediones 5–6.53,107−112 Indeed, the THEIC moiety attached by 1,3-propylene linker appropriately
modifies the surface of MCM-41 for a prompt catalytic activity of
MCM-41-Pr-THEIC nanomaterials (1). Moreover, the byproduct
water molecules can be simply adsorbed on the surface of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC
nanomaterials (1).

Pseudo-Four-Component Reaction

and Nitrogen Sources 4a–b Catalyzed
by MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1)
On the other hand, reusability of a heterogeneous
catalyst is a
significant feature for its industrial applications. Therefore, the
recycled MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) was washed with acetone
to remove any organic impurities and then heated in an oven to be
reused in the model reactions for the next run. This procedure was
repeated for three more consecutive runs (Figure 8). It was found that the reactivity of catalyst 1 for the Hantzsch pseudo-four-component synthesis of acridinedione
derivatives 5a and 6a decreases slightly
(approximately 8%) after five runs. The latest isolated yields of 5a or 6a after four times of catalyst recycling
were 82 and 84%, respectively.

MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) for the synthesis of 5a (orange charts) and 6a (gray charts).

To demonstrate the appropriate catalytic activity
of the new hybrid
heterogeneous nano-ordered catalyst MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1), its performance has been compared to that of some recently reported
catalytic systems for the synthesis of acridinedione derivatives 5a and 6a. The summarized results in Table 3 obviously show that
some of the reported catalysts are homogeneous and cannot be reused.
Furthermore, the present protocol provides better performance in terms
of product yield, catalyst loading, reaction time, operational simplicity,
and frequency of recycling compared to most of previously published
catalytic systems.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel and
powerful 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)isocyanurate
covalently functionalized nano-ordered MCM-41 (MCM-41-Pr-THEIC) as
a robust and recoverable catalyst for the pseudo-four-component condensation
of dimedone, aldehydes, and ammonium acetate or p-toluidine to afford the acridinedione derivatives under extremly
green conditions. The notable advantages of this method are clean
reaction profiles, short reaction time, and high to quantitative yields
without using precious or toxic metals and hazardous organic solvents,
which makes it an improved and more practical alternative to the existing
methods. Additionally, the catalyst could be simply separated and
reused without apparent loss of its activity at least after four cycles.
Due to the notable advantages of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC nanocatalyst,
its applications in other organic reactions are currently underway
in our lab and would be reported in due course.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Apparatus
All chemicals were purchased
from Merck or Aldrich with the highest purity available, and benzaldehyde
was used as a freshly distilled sample. The morphological, structural,
and compositional characterizations of the nanocatalyst 1 were properly carried out using FESEM TESCAN-MIRA3, EDX Numerix
DXP-X10P, Philips CM30, Shimadzu FTIR-8400S, TGA Bahr company STA
504, and CHN Elemental instruments. Characterization of introduced
nanocatalyst 1 was performed by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, Philips CM30). A Shimadzu FTIR-8400S spectrometer
and a Bruker DRX-500 Avance spectrometer (ambient temperature in DMSO-d6) were used for recording FTIR, 1H NMR (500 MHz), and 13C NMR (125 MHz) spectra of products.
The analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) experiments were performed
using Merck 0.2 mm silica gel 60 F-254 Al-plates for observation progress
of reactions. All melting points were determined using a digital Electrothermal
9100 capillary melting point apparatus. The isolated yields of products
have been reported. All of the products, except 6J, are
known compounds, and their physical, analytical, and spectroscopic
data were in agreement with the authentic samples.

Typical Procedure for Preparation of MCM-41
MCM-41
materials were prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis according
to a known procedure as follows: In a general procedure, dimethylamine
(60 mmol, 2.70 g) was added to deionized water (42 mL) in a 200 mL
beaker while the mixture was stirred at room temperature. Then, CTAB
(4 mmol, 1.47 g) was added to the above solution to obtain a clear
solution after stirring for 30 min. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (10 mmol,
2.10 g) was then added into the mixture with stirring. By dropwise
addition of HCl solution (1 M), the pH of the mixture was adjusted
to 8.5, to obtain a final precipitate. After 2 h stirring, white precipitates
were obtained, which were filtered, washed with deionized water, dried
at 45 °C, and calcined at 550 °C for 45 h to remove the
residual CTAB template.45

General Procedure for Preparation of the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) nanomaterials
In a 200 mL round-bottom flask,
1,3-dibromopropane (49 mmol, d = 1.98 g cm–3, 5 mL) was added to a suspension containing MCM-41 (1.0 g) in dry
toluene (30 mL). Then, the mixture was stirred continuously at room
temperature for 18 h. After this time, the obtained solids were filtered
and washed with toluene and EtOH several times to remove any excess
of the linker. Next, dried white solids (1.0 g) were dispersed in
dry toluene (30 mL). Following this, THEIC (3.82 mmol, 1.8 g), K2CO3 (4.0 mmol, 0.6 g), and KI (0.12 mmol, 0.02
g) were added to the obtained mixture, respectively. The mixture was
stirred at a constant rate at room temperature for 10 h. Then, the
obtained solids were filtered off and washed with toluene and EtOH
for several times. Finally, the residues were dried in a vacuum drying
oven at 60 °C for 8 h. The schematic route for the preparation
of MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) nanomaterials is shown in Scheme 1.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Acridinedione Derivatives
(5a–j, 6a–j) Catalyzed by the MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1) Nanomaterials
In a 5 mL round-bottom flask, dimedone (2, 1 mmol),
aldehyde (3a–j, 1 mmol), NH4OAc (4a, 1.2 mmol) or p-toluidine (4b, 1 mmol), and MCM-41-Pr-THEIC (1, 15 mg) were
added to EtOH 96%:H2O (1:2, 2 mL). The obtained mixture
was stirred and heated under reflux conditions for the times indicated
in Table 2. The progress
of the reactions was monitored by TLC (eluent: EtOAc:n-hexane, 1:3).
After completion of the reaction, 96% EtOH (2 mL) was added and the
mixture was heated to dissolve any solid products 5–6 and the solid catalyst 1 remained insoluble.
The catalyst was then separated by filtration and n-hexane (one to
three drops) was added to the filtrate and then allowed to cool over
time to give pure crystals of the desired acridinedione derivatives 5–6. The separated catalyst was suspended
in acetone (1 mL), stirred for 30 min, and then filtered off. The
residue white powder was then heated in an oven at 60 °C for
1.5 h and reused for successive runs.
