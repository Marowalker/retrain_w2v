An efficient and
environmentally friendly synthesis of AlFe-pillared
clay (AlFe-PILC)-supported MnCe catalysts was explored. Mixed AlFe
pillaring agents were prepared by a one-step method using Locron L
and ferric nitrate solutions at a high temperature and high pressure.
Montmorillonite was treated with the AlFe pillaring agents to synthesize
AlFe-PILC. MnOx and CeO2 with
different Mn/Ce atomic ratios were loaded onto the AlFe-PILC support
by an impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized using
X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectrometry and were
tested for the catalytic combustion of benzene and temperature-programmed
surface reaction using a microreactor. Compared to conventional methods,
this method is simpler and less costly and results in a larger specific
surface area, pore volume, and basal spacing, with the ability to
control the structure of the catalytic materials. MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC
has the highest catalytic activity and can completely degrade benzene
(600 ppm in air) at 250 °C. The activity of the catalyst is stable,
and no obvious deactivation is observed at 230 °C after 1000
continuous hours. The catalyst is resistant to water and Cl-poisoning.
The amount of CeO2 added is critical to the dispersion
of MnOx on the support and the creation
of optimum number of oxygen vacancy defect sites for the benzene oxidation
reaction. The AlFe-PILC-supported MnCe catalyst is a promising porous
material; the support structure, proper dispersion of active species,
and addition of Ce are essential for achieving complete degradation
of organic toxic chemicals at relatively low temperatures.

1 Introduction
Clay
minerals, such as montmorillonite (Mt), kaolinite, hydrotalcite,
and so on, have recently received considerable attention because of
their abundance, low cost, and environmental compatibility. Mt belongs
to the smectite clay mineral group and is the most popular type of
clay applied in pillaring processes.1−4 Because of their excellent properties and
versatility, clay minerals are excellent materials for use as heterogeneous
catalysts. Clay pillaring is a procedure that converts layered clay
minerals into highly porous structures.5 The process involves exchanging the interlayer cations with large
inorganic polymeric oxyhydroxy cationic species, which are converted
into oxides that are strongly bonded to minerals (“pillars”)
after calcination processes.6 In common
pillared clay (PILC) synthesis, metal ions, such as Al3+, Zr4+ and Fe3+, are mixed with a basic solution
(NaOH or NaCO3) and stirred at a certain temperature for
3–12 h, followed by 6–24 h of aging at 60–80
°C to obtain polycations, which are pillaring agents. The main
drawback of this process is that it requires the preparation and consumption
of large amount of solutions.7−9 Thus the preparation is expensive,
unstable, and difficult to reproduce because of the effects of the
container, mixing equipment, temperature, and humidity. It is also
prone to contamination when exposed to air, so it is unfavorable for
a wide range of applications.

Using a variety of elements to
synthesize composite pillaring agents
for the preparation of PILCs can greatly improve the specific surface
area, pore volume, and thermal stability. Vicente et al. have described
the wide uses of mixed pillaring agents over the past 30 years.5 The authors have listed more than 10 types of
mixed pillaring agents that contain Al as a component and have mentioned
that Al-free mixed pillaring solutions have also been employed.4 However, disadvantages in the preparation process
remain. In this study, we use a high-temperature, high-pressure, one-step
method to synthesize composite AlFe pillaring agents for the first
time. This method has the following advantages: (a) It offers simple
preparation, minimal equipment requirements, and highly reproducible
results. (b) It is inexpensive and makes use of readily available
materials in the preparation process. For example, Locron L (commercially
available as an antiperspirant) replaces NaOH and AlCl3 solutions, reducing production costs and environmental pollution.
(c) It involves the synthesis of AlFe-PILC, which has a large specific
surface area, pore volume, and basal spacing as well as a controllable
structure.

PILCs have uniform pore distributions, large specific
surface areas,
and high thermal stability and are therefore excellent catalytic materials
and supports. PILCs can be considered as promising alternative supports
because they have larger pore size than zeolites,10 thus making pore blockage by carbon deposition more difficult.
A recent popular research area has been the preparation of PILC-supported
catalysts for environmentally friendly reactions.11−15 The destruction by complete oxidation of hazardous
gaseous pollutants is an interesting application of PILC catalysts.16−19 Pollutants are usually present in air streams at low concentrations,
requiring highly efficient technologies for total oxidation, avoiding
the formation of harmful byproducts.20,21

Volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) include all organic compounds
that exist in the gaseous state in ambient air. To reduce the environmental
impact of VOCs, the existing legislation has to be more stringent.22 The catalytic combustion of VOCs can occur at
lower temperatures than that without a catalyst. It is more energy
efficient, and therefore has a distinct economic advantage.23,24 The most commonly used catalysts in the complete oxidation of VOCs
are noble metals and metal oxides.25−28 Noble metals that can be used
in catalytic combustion include Pt and Pd. Supported noble metal catalysts
exhibit excellent initial activity, as manifested mainly by lower
light-off temperatures and minimal differences between the complete
combustion temperature and the light-off temperature; that is, their
activity increases rapidly with increasing reaction temperature.29,30 However, noble metals also possess several disadvantages because
of their rarity, high cost, and poor toxic tolerance. Therefore, researchers
are searching for alternatives to noble metals. Transition metal oxide
catalysts have suitable catalytic activity for the catalytic combustion
of VOCs and have strong antipoisoning capability. The most commonly
used active ingredients are Cr, Co, Mn, and Cu oxides.21,27,28,31−35 Rare earth metals (predominantly in the form of oxides) in catalysts
play a critical role in the catalytic combustion of industrial organic
waste gases and can be added to improve the thermal stability, activity,
and reaction half-life of the catalyst.19,29,34,36−39

Here, a high-temperature, high-pressure, one-step method is
used
to synthesize composite AlFe pillaring agents, and subsequently AlFe-PILC.
Compared to Na–Mt and Al-PILC, this material has larger specific
surface area and pore volume as well as an adjustable pore structure.
Given these excellent structural characteristics, AlFe-PILC can successfully
act as a catalytic material. Our previous work with cerium in precious
metal and transition metal catalysts showed that cerium plays an important
role in combustion reactions.40−43 Here, we used the transition metals Mn and Ce on
AlFe-PILC to prepare composite oxide catalysts with our efficient
and environmentally friendly method and investigated their activities
in the catalytic degradation of benzene.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Preparation of the Support and Catalyst
2.1.1 Materials
The starting material
for the pillaring procedure was the sodium form of montmorillonite
(Na–Mt) (>100 mesh, Baotou, China). Al-pillaring agents
aged
at 60 °C for 8 h were synthesized, and Al-PILC was prepared following
a procedure similar to that described in our previous work.19,40,41

2.1.2 Preparation
of AlFe Pillaring Agents
AlFe pillaring agents were prepared
as follows: Locron L [Al2(OH)5Cl·2–3H2O], a basic
aluminum chloride-based liquid (Clariant, Switzerland), which is commercially
available as an antiperspirant, was used as the aluminum source. Locron
L (10 mL, Al ion concentration was 6.0 mol/L) and the desired volume
of ferric nitrate solution (6.0 mol/L) were added to an autoclave
at an atomic ratio of Al/Fe = 5/1, and then deionized water was added
into the autoclave to further dilute the solution until the concentration
of Al ions reached 2.5 mol/L. The autoclave was then placed in an
oven at 120 °C for 12 h and was then removed and placed in cold
water to cool. The solution was removed from the autoclave once the
temperature dropped to room temperature and was then diluted to 600
mL to adjust the Al ion concentration to 0.1 mol/L.41,44 The solution was used in subsequent steps as an AlFe pillaring agent.
The preparation of AlFe-PILC is as follows: AlFe pillaring agents
were added dropwise into Na–Mt (2 wt %) at a ratio of 20 mmol
of Al per gram of Na–Mt and stirred at 60 °C for 3 h,
followed by centrifugation and washing with deionized water to remove
Cl–; the product was then dried at 110 °C in
an oven and calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 4 h to
obtain AlFe-PILC.

2.1.3 Preparation of the Supported
MnCe Catalysts
Particles of Mn/Na–Mt, Mn/Al-PILC,
Mn/AlFe-PILC, and MnCe/AlFe-PILC
were obtained by impregnating equal volumes of the support as well
as Na–Mt, Al-PILC, and AlFe-PILC onto the precursor overnight
to a Mn and Ce nitrate solution, followed by drying, calcining the
samples at 500 °C for 2 h, and passing the solution through a
#40–60 sieve. The total loading amount of Mn or MnCe for all
of the catalysts was 10 wt %, and the Mn/Ce atomic ratios were 3:1,
6:1, 9:1, and 12:1.41

2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the samples were obtained using a PANalytical Empyrean
powder diffractometer operated with a Cu Kα source (λ
= 0.15406 nm), a tube voltage of 40 kV, and a tube current of 40 mA.
The powder technique was used, and the oriented specimens were prepared
by spreading the sample on a glass slide. The divergence slit was
1/8° and the antiscatter slit was 1/4°. The intensity data
were collected in the 2θ range of 3–15° (80°)
with a scan step-size of 0.0263° and a scan speed of 2°/min.

The specific surface area (SBET) and
pore volume (Vp) of each clay material
and the catalyst were measured using a TriStar II 3020 apparatus (Micromeritics
Company, USA) at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The samples were
pretreated at 250 °C in vacuum for 4 h. SBET was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation, whereas Vp was evaluated
from the nitrogen uptake at a relative N2 pressure of P/P0 = 0.99. The t-plot method was used to determine the mesoporous surface area (Ames) and micropore volume (Vmic). The pore-size distribution was calculated using
the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.

High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted
using a JEOL-2010F (HR) to obtain the morphologies of Na–Mt
and AlFe-PILC. The working voltage was 200 kV. The samples were embedded
in epoxy resin and then microtomed into sub-100 nm ultrathin films
at room temperature. These thin-film samples that floated on water
or other solvents were collected by a copper mesh with a polymer microgrid
for HRTEM imaging and elemental mapping. The particle morphologies
of MnCe/AlFe-PILC were observed using a JEOL-2100F (HR). The processing
was the same as that given above. The chemical composition of the
catalyst was determined with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
using an Oxford INCA instrument (Oxford Instruments, UK).

The
manganese and cerium contents of 10% MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC were
determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) on a Leeman ICP-AES Prodigy XP (Leeman Labs, USA) after
the powder was dissolved in a mixture of fuming nitric acid and concentrated
hydrochloric acid (volume ratio: 1/1).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) spectra (Ce 3d) of 10% MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC
were collected on a Thermo K-Alpha spectrometer using Al–K
radiation at 1486.6 eV/12.5 kV, and all spectra were calibrated based
on the binding energy of C1s (284.6 eV). The Mn and Ce
contents of the catalyst were approximately 6.52 and 2.73 wt %, respectively,
and the ratio of Mn/Ce was about 6.08.

2.3 Catalytic
Activity Tests
The activity
of the catalyst (200 mg) was evaluated in a WFS-3010 microreactor
(Xianquan, Tianjin, China) at a benzene concentration of 600 ppm and
a space velocity of 30 000 h–1. The online
measurement was conducted using a Shimadzu GC-14C (flame ionization
detector) gas chromatograph (operating conditions: vaporizer temperature
of 170 °C and column temperature of 120 °C), and the data
were recorded and analyzed using an N2000 chromatography data workstation.
The activity of the catalysts was examined by analyzing three consecutive
combustion tests between 100 and 500 °C. The combustion experiments
consisted of increasing the temperature in steps of 20 °C. The T50 parameter (temperature needed to attain 50%
conversion) was used as the criterion for evaluating the catalytic
performance. The conversion data were calculated by the difference
between the inlet and outlet concentrations. The degradation products
were detected by mass spectrometry (MS). No byproducts other than
H2O and CO2 were detected. Thus, the conversion
was calculated based on benzene consumption.

2.4 Temperature-Programmed
Surface Reaction (TPSR)
of Benzene
The in situ TPSR of benzene on the catalytic materials
was also conducted. The catalyst (200 mg) was pretreated in a 20%
O2/Ar flow (99.99%, 60 mL min–1) at 300
°C for 30 min. After cooling to 50 °C, 1000 ppm benzene
was injected into the reaction system. After reaching the adsorption–desorption
equilibrium, the catalyst was heated from 50 to 500 °C in increments
of 7.5 °C min–1 in 600 ppm benzene; the balance
gas was 20% O2/Ar at 60 mL min–1. The
concentrations of benzene, any byproduct, and the final product (CO2) were measured online by MS (QGA, Hiden, UK).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 XRD Analysis
Figure 1 shows the XRD spectra
of Na–Mt, Al-PILC,
and AlFe-PILC. The spectra show that the 2θ value of the PILCs
shifted and decreased. The d001 value
of Al-PILC is 1.77 nm, which is much larger than that of Na–Mt
(1.23 nm). The d001 value of the composite
AlFe-PILC is 1.91 nm, which is larger than that of Al-PILC. This increase
in the basal spacing occurred because the Al/Fe polycations that intercalated
between the layers are larger than the Al polycations (Keggin ions)
in size, thereby creating larger layers. These results illustrate
that the synthesis of the PILCs was successful. The thermal stability
of AlFe-PILC was evaluated based on these results: the layered structure
remained stable at 650–700 °C, but the diffraction peak
at 2θ = 4.64° completely disappeared at approximately 800
°C, indicating the destruction of the layered structure (these
spectra are not included).

Figure 1 XRD spectra of the supports: (a) Na–Mt;
(b) Al-PILC; and
(c) AlFe-PILC.

Figure 2 presents
the XRD spectra (2θ: 3°–80°) of the catalysts,
and the reflections at 19.8° and 26.7° (2θ) belong
to cristobalite and quartz, respectively. After MnCe loading on the
supports, the d001 peak still exists and
there is no change in the d001 value,
which indicates that the structure of the supports are very stable.
The diffraction peaks of MnOx and Fe2O3 are present in the spectra of the catalysts.
No CeO2 is observed, possibly because of the low loading
amount and its high dispersion on the supports. For Mn/Na–Mt,
Mn2O3 is observed, whereas no MnO2 is detected. By contrast, for Mn/AlFe-PILC, MnO2 is observed,
whereas no Mn2O3 is detected. Neither MnO2 nor Mn2O3 is detected on MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC,
indicating that the addition of Ce dispersed MnOx, resulting in a crystalline size that was too small to be
detected by the in-house XRD. Therefore, more manganese oxide species
exist in higher oxidation states on AlFe-PILC-based catalysts, and
the dispersion of MnO2 is improved by adding CeO2.

and (c) MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC.

3.2 N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Figure 3 presents
the adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions
of various types of samples. The adsorption–desorption isotherms
of all of the materials are the standard IV type, whereas the H3-type
adsorption–desorption hysteresis appears above a relative pressure
of 0.45, indicating the presence of slit pores formed by the layerlike
structures in the material. The N2 adsorption capacity
of Na–Mt is small, as reflected by the small pore volume of
this material,44 which is confirmed by
the data presented in Table 1. The improved pore structures of Al-PILC considerably increased
their N2 adsorption capacities; moreover, the N2 adsorption capacity of AlFe-PILC is significantly larger than the
mononuclear PILC. The same trend is observed for SBET and Vp. This indicates
that the composite AlFe polycations that formed were larger than the
Al polycations (Keggin ions); therefore, the clay layers were more
separated and more porous structures were formed. The addition of
Mn and Ce to Na–Mt, Al-PILC, and AlFe-PILC resulted in a decrease
in the N2 adsorption capacity, reflecting a reduction in
the pore volume. The loss of pore volume indicates that the doped
cations entered the pores of the supports.

samples: (a) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms and (b) pore-size distribution.

from the Horvath and Kawazoe (HK) model.

b Pore volumes of the samples were
estimated through N2 isotherms at a relative pressure of P/P0 = 0.99.

The average mesopore diameters of
the AlFe-PILC materials are approximately
3.96 nm, which is wider than the pore diameters of Al-PILC and Na–Mt;
this indicates that the pore size increased during pillaring, leading
to a layered mesoporous structure. The addition of Mn and Ce to AlFe-PILC
decreased the pore volume. The average pore size of Mn/AlFe-PILC and
MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC is approximately 3.89 nm. The mesoporous structure
of the AlFe-PILC support was not destroyed, illustrating the excellent
performance of AlFe-PILC as a support.

Table 1 summarizes
the textural data of the samples. The optimal synthesis conditions
were an Al/Fe atomic ratio of 5, pillaring-agent aging time of 12
h, and aging temperature of 120 °C. Under these conditions, the SBET, Vp, and d001 values of AlFe-PILC are 318 m2/g, 0.195 cm3/g, and 1.91 nm, respectively. Compared with
the Na–Mt and AlFe-PILC supports, the supported Mn or MnCe
catalysts exhibit lower SBET and Vp values. This decrease can be attributed to
the migration of some of the Mn and Ce ions into the pores and clay
layers, which blocked some of the pores. Meanwhile, SBET and Vp decreased when
the catalyst was doped with Ce, possibly because the radius of a Ce
ion is much larger than that of a Mn ion, and thus the Ce ion can
block more pores.39 Abundant micro-mesoporosity
in the AlFe-PILC supports is favorable for the even dispersion of
active species and rapid diffusion of reactants, which could greatly
enhance their catalytic performance during various reactions.

3.3 HRTEM Analysis
Figure 4 presents the HRTEM images and EDS spectra
of the samples. A two-dimensional layered structure with a small basal
space is shown in the image of Na–Mt. A regular two-dimensional
porous structure is shown in the image of AlFe-PILC. Compared with
Na–Mt, the clay layers in AlFe-PILC were widely separated and
had larger pore structures, indicating that the regular mesoporous
structure was retained during the high-temperature calcination process
in the AlFe-PILC preparation. The layered structure of MnCe/AlFe-PILC
was not damaged by the loading of the active ingredients, and the
active particles were uniformly distributed throughout the support
and did not aggregate. The HRTEM images clearly reveal the stable
layered structure and the well-dispersed active ingredients in AlFe-PILC.
Al, Fe, Mn, Ce, O, and other elements were identified in the EDS spectra,
confirming the successful loading of the active species (Mn and Ce)
on the surface of AlFe-PILC. These results indicate that AlFe-PILC
is an excellent support and that the active species of the catalysts
are well-dispersed without aggregation on the support. All of these
properties contribute to the excellent catalytic performance of the
catalyst in benzene degradation.

AlFe-PILC; and (c) MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC
and the EDS spectra.

3.4 Catalytic Activity and Stability Tests
Figure 5 presents
the conversion of benzene using various catalysts. The Na–Mt-supported
Mn catalyst exhibited poor activity, and complete conversion of the
benzene did not occur until 480 °C. The Al-PILC-supported Mn
catalyst can completely degrade benzene at 380 °C, approximately
100 °C lower than the temperature required for Mn/Na–Mt.
The AlFe-PILC-supported Mn catalyst exhibits a significantly improved
activity and completely degrades benzene at 330 °C. The addition
of various amounts of Ce further improves the catalytic activity of
the Mn/AlFe-PILC catalysts. Additionally, the Mn/Ce atomic ratios
affect the catalytic activity. MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC exhibits the highest
activity and can completely degrade benzene at approximately 250 °C.
Compared with the noble metal catalysts or other transition metal
oxide catalysts, this catalyst has excellent performance in benzene
combustion, as shown in Table S1.39,45−48

Figure 5 Light-off
curves of benzene combustion during the third reaction
cycle. Benzene concentration: 600 ppm; GHSV: 30 000 h–1; and catalyst amount: 200 mg.

Figure 6 shows
the T50 values corresponding to three
consecutive
reaction cycles performed for Mn/Na–Mt, Mn/Al-PILC, Mn/AlFe-PILC,
and MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC. Generally, T50 decreases after consecutive cycles for all of the catalysts, and
this results in an increase in the catalytic activity. The largest
decrease in T50 occurs between the first
and second cycles, whereas T50 remains
relatively stable after the second cycle. These results indicate the
activation of the chemical sites of the catalysts during the first
cycle, which may occur during the heating process. The Ce 3d spectra
of 10% MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC (fresh and after the first cycle) were
detected by XPS, as shown in Figure S1.
The u′ and v′ represented the two characteristic peaks
of Ce3+, and the other six characteristic peaks were attributed
to Ce4+.49,50 The change in the atomic ratio
of Ce4+/Ce3+ for the fresh catalysts, (Ce4+/Ce3+ = 4.75) and (Ce4+/Ce3+ = 3.59), for the first cycle indicated that there was a redox reaction
that occurred between Ce4+ and Ce3+. A higher
Ce3+ concentration can produce more oxygen vacancies on
catalysts. The spectra indicate that the used catalyst after the first
cycle contains more oxygen vacancies. It is known that CeO2 has been studied because of its ability to store and release oxygen
via the redox shift between Ce4+ and Ce3+. In
this study, the lattice oxygen ([O]) came from the valence state changes
of Ce and Mn, which can be described as 2CeO2 →
Ce2O3 + [O] and 2MnO2 → Mn2O3 + [O]; the transfer of O2 from the
adsorbed oxygen (O*) to lattice oxygen in metal oxides is O2 → 2O*; Ce2O3 + O* → CeO2; and Mn2O3 + O* → MnO2.51 Considering the results from our studies,
the ratio of CeO2/Ce2O3 on the surface
of the catalysts plays an important role in determining the activity.
Interestingly, the addition of ceria to the MnOx catalyst leads to an increase in the activity of the mixed
oxides. MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC is the most active and stable catalyst,
which may be attributed to CeO2 because of its high oxygen
storage capacity and a facile Ce4+/Ce3+ redox
cycle as well as the interaction between CeO2 and MnOx.52−54

for three consecutive
benzene catalytic combustion cycles.

Figure 7 shows
the
result of the lifetime test for the most active catalyst (MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC)
at 230 °C for 1000 h. The conversion of benzene remained at approximately
90%, with no obvious deactivation, which indicates that the catalyst
is stable for benzene degradation. In practice, water and chlorinated
VOCs exist in waste gases. As shown in Figure 7, the activity of the catalyst decreases
slightly during the first continuous 100 h reaction in the presence
of 100 ppm chlorobenzene because of competitive adsorption and oxidation
on the active sites. When 10 000 ppm water is introduced, the
activity decreases further because of competitive adsorption. The
catalytic activity recovers to the initial level after water and chlorobenzene
are removed, indicating that the presence of water may promote the
removal of coke and Cl species from the catalyst surface. These results
indicate that MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC has promise for adoption by industry
because of its high catalytic performance for the combustion of both
nonchlorinated and chlorinated VOCs and its excellent resistance to
water and Cl adsorption.

at 230 °C.

3.5 Benzene-TPSR
The catalytic process
is a dynamic in situ surface reaction. Thus, to investigate the oxidative
performance of the catalysts under dynamic conditions and to obtain
additional information on the adsorption–desorption and oxidizing
properties of the catalysts during benzene combustion, the evolution
of any possible organic byproduct and final product (CO2) on the catalyst surface was evaluated by in situ TPSR. As shown
in Figure 8, from 50
to 180 °C and most noticeably at approximately 90–110
°C, the signal of benzene is observed in waste gas, whereas the
signal of CO2 is absent, indicating that only the desorption
of benzene occurred. Na–Mt, Al-PILC, and AlFe-PILC-supported
catalysts differed greatly in their benzene desorption capacity, and
the capacity increases in the order of Mn/Na–Mt < Mn/AlFe-PILC
< Mn/AlFe-PILC ≈ MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC. These results indicate
that the significantly increased pore volume and basal spacing of
AlFe-PILC compared with Na–Mt and Al-PILC caused a significant
increase in the benzene desorption capacity. The desorption peak of
benzene is smaller for Mn/Na–Mt than that for AlFe-PILC-supported
catalysts, implying that its adsorption ability is weaker, which is
not beneficial for benzene oxidation.44 As the reaction temperature increases, the oxidation of benzene
becomes apparent because of the detection of CO2. The benzene
adsorbed on the catalyst surface at low temperatures is destroyed
at elevated temperatures. The temperature at which the benzene signal
disappears increases in the order of MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC < Mn/AlFe-PILC
< Mn/Al-PILC < Mn/Na–Mt, which agrees with the order
of catalytic activity (shown in Figure 5). The evolution of CO2 is accompanied by
the oxidation of benzene. The temperature for the appearance of the
CO2 signal increases in the order of MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC
< Mn/AlFe-PILC < Mn/Al-PILC < Mn/Na–Mt, which is consistent
with the order of the benzene signal disappearance. These results
show that the promoted support structure and addition of Ce can significantly
promote the catalytic combustion of benzene.

catalysts.

4 Conclusions
In this study, AlFe-pillaring agents were synthesized using a one-step,
high-temperature, high-pressure hydrothermal method, followed by the
synthesis of AlFe-PILC through ion-exchange. The structure and properties
of these materials were characterized. The results indicate that the
specific surface area, pore volume, and basal spacing of AlFe-PILC
are much larger than those of Na–Mt and that the AlFe-PILC
pore structure is superior to Al-PILC, demonstrating that the AlFe-PILC
synthesized in this study is a porous material with excellent properties.
Preliminary experiments were conducted to investigate the performance
of the optimum AlFe-PILC sample for the catalytic combustion of benzene.
The results demonstrate that after calcination at 550 °C, the
pore structure of the catalyst support remained stable and the supported
active ingredients were uniformly dispersed without aggregation. MnCe(6:1)/AlFe-PILC
completely degrades a low concentration of benzene at approximately
250 °C, and the conversion remained stable for 1000 h, demonstrating
the excellent performance and durability of the catalyst for the catalytic
combustion of benzene.
