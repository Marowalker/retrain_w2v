A two-step
one-pot efficient synthesis of pyrido[2,3-b]indoles
via reaction between isatin, α-amino acid, and dipolarophile
has been developed. The initial 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between
the reactants that is performed in the presence of either CuI or methanol
results in spirooxindoles that undergo POCl3-mediated intramolecular
dehydrative transformation to afford the title compounds.

==== Body
Introduction
Pyrido[2,3-b]indole, commonly referred to as α-carboline,
is the core unit of several natural products1 and pharmacologically active compounds endowed with cytotoxic, anticancer,
antimalarial, antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory
activities (Figure 1).2 Given such importance, considerable
efforts have been made into developing multiple strategies for the
synthesis of pyrido[2,3-b]indole derivatives, which
have been reviewed by Brimble et al. recently.3,4 Simultaneously,
many approaches for the synthesis of neocryptolepine, an important
natural compound containing this structural motif, are also reported.5 Unfortunately, most of these methods suffer from
low atom economy, lack of substrate generality, use of highly functionalized
starting materials, expensive transition metals, or harsh conditions,
thereby underscoring the need for development of a general and efficient
approach to this heterocycle.

containing pyrido[2,3-b]indole moiety.

It is widely reported that a multicomponent reaction
between isatin,
α-amino acid, and dipolarophile offers spirooxindoles.6 The reaction proceeds via imine formation between
the amino acid and isatin, followed by decarboxylation of the amino
acid to produce an azomethine ylide, which then undergoes 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition with a dipolarophile to afford the product. During the
studies related to the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction of spiroindolones,
Black et al. reported that heating 4′,6′-dimethoxyspiro[[1,3]dithiolane-2,3′-indolin]-2′-one
with POCl3 in the presence of 4,6-dimethoxy-2,3-diphenyl-1H-indole afforded biindolyl (Figure 2).7 This reaction
was suggested to proceed via formation of 7,9-dimethoxy-3,6-dihydro-2H-[1,4]dithiino[2,3-b]indol-6-ylium intermediate,
which underwent nucleophilic attack with 4,6-dimethoxy-2,3-diphenyl-1H-indole. Based on this report, we envisaged that spirooxindoles
bearing a pyrroline ring may undergo similar ring expansion reaction
with POCl3 to offer pyrido[2,3-b]indoles.
Notably, the intermolecular and intramolecular aminations of amides
with NH heterocycles, N-substituted anilines, or
pyridine for preparing aza heterocycles using POCl3 are
widely reported in the literature8 (Figure 2). Besides, it is
cited that indolin-2-one furnishes a mixture of triindole and tetraindole
in the presence of POCl3.9 We
reasoned that treating spirooxindole with POCl3 would produce
an active intermediate A, which may undergo nucleophilic
displacement with the pyrroline nitrogen to form intermediate B (Scheme 1). Subsequently, an intramolecular rearrangement of intermediate B would result in 1-substituted-1H-α-carboline.
To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of report concerning
synthesis of such new four-membered annulated heterocyclic system
from spirooxindole, and therefore, we considered probing the envisaged
reaction. Accordingly, the spirooxindole was prepared by the reaction
between isatin, proline, and phenylacetylene, and treatment with POCl3 under heating resulted in the formation of pyrido[2,3-b]indole. This initial success prompted us to study the
scope of this novel dehydrative transformation in detail and explore
if pyrido[2,3-b]indoles could be prepared directly
from isatin as a one-pot protocol. The details of the results pertaining
to this study are presented herein.

Figure 2 Previously reported strategies and the
present work.

Scheme 1 Proposed Pathway
for the Synthesis of Pyrido[2,3-b]indole from Spirooxindole
via Intramolecular Dehydration
Results and Discussion
Initially, a pilot reaction
of isatin (1a) with proline
(2a) and phenylacetylene (3a) in the presence
of CuI in MeCN under heating afforded spirooxindole 4aaa.10 Subsequent reaction of 4aaa with 20 equiv of POCl3 at 105 °C for 20 h resulted
in isolation of a solid product (79%) that was spectrally established
to be the expected 5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indolizino[5,6-b]indole 5aaa. To improve the yield of 5aaa, optimization of the protocol by titrating the amount
of POCl3, modulating the temperature, and replacing POCl3 with other dehydrating agents was performed, and the results
are summarized in Table 1. Lowering the temperature to 90 °C and reducing the amount
of the POCl3 gave 5aaa in a superior yield
of 86%. Further lowering the temperature or the amount of POCl3, however, proved detrimental for the synthesis of 5aaa. We observed that POBr3 gave comparable yield of 5aaa, but PCl5, SOCl2, PPA, or P2O5 was ineffective for the protocol. Thus, the
optimized condition for the synthesis of pyrido[2,3-b]indole from spirooxindole that worked best in our hands was reacting 4aaa with 5 equiv of POCl3 at 90 °C for 24
h.

a All reactions were performed using 4aaa (0.5 mmol) in a sealed tube.

b Isolated yield after column chromatography.

c 1.0 mL of toluene was used as the
solvent.

With the standardized
conditions identified, the scope of the reaction
was investigated with a variety of spirooxindoles 4 (Scheme 2). The first set
of spirooxindoles 4aab–4aak were
prepared from isatin 1a, proline 2a, and
different acetylenes 3b–k (see the Supporting Information (SI) for details). It
was found that all substrates smoothly afforded the corresponding
products 5aab–5aak in 78–87%
yields, thereby reflecting that the protocol could accommodate aryl,
heteroaryl, as well as aliphatic starting materials. In addition,
the structures of these products were unambiguously secured by performing
X-ray crystallographic analysis on a single crystal of 5aaf. For the next set of reactions, spirooxindoles 4baa–4kaa prepared from substituted isatins 1b–k, proline 2a, and phenylacetylene 3a were used. It was pleasing to discover that all spirooxindoles
underwent dehydrative transformation to afford the respective products 5baa–5kaa in excellent yields (Scheme 2). These results
suggested that the electronic nature of the substitution on the isatin
unit also had no impact on the outcome of the protocol. To demonstrate
the essentiality of a free NH in the isatin unit for success in this
transformation, 4laa was prepared and subjected to reaction
with POCl3, which resulted in decomposition of the starting
material (Scheme 3).

Scheme 2 Scope of Synthesis of Substituted Pyrido[2,3-b]indoles
(5) from Spirooxindoles (4)
All reactions were performed
using 0.5 mmol of 4 in a sealed tube.

Scheme 3 Control Reaction
Success of the protocol with a variety of substrates motivated
us to explore the possibility of a one-pot, two-step process from
isatin, thereby eliminating the need for isolation of the spirooxindole.
Thus, in a model reaction, 1a, 2a, and 3a were treated first with CuI in MeCN, followed by removal
of the solvent and addition of POCl3 to the residue and
heating the mixture for 24 h. This one-pot procedure afforded 5aaa in 70% yield, which was relatively better than the overall
yield of 67% obtained in the two-step procedure (Scheme 4). Buoyed by this success,
we evaluated the one-pot syntheses of 5aaj, 5aak, 5baa, and 5daa and found that, in each
case, yield of the product was better than the two-step process (for
comparison, refer to the SI).

Scheme 4 One-Pot
Synthesis of Pyrido[2,3-b]indoles (5),
All
reactions were performed
using 1.0 mmol of 1, 1.0 mmol of 2a, 1.2
mmol of 3, and 5 mmol of POCl3.

8 mmol of POCl3 was used.

Aiming at broadening the scope of the protocol,
we next investigated
the two-step, one-pot procedure with internal alkynes instead of terminal
alkynes. The reaction of alkyne 3l with 1a and 2a failed to afford the desired 5aal in a one-pot process. Hence, we considered exploring reactions with
activated alkynes since they are reported to offer spirooxindoles
under metal-free conditions.11 Accordingly,
treating internal alkynes 3m–o with 1a and 2a in methanol under metal-free condition
successfully furnished the required spirooxindoles. Evaporating of
solvent and treating the crude spirooxindoles with POCl3 at 90 °C furnished 5aam, 5aan, and 5aao in 79–82% yield (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 One-Pot Synthesis of Pyrido[2,3-b]indoles (5)
from Internal Alkynes
All reactions were performed
using 1.0 mmol of 1a, 1.0 mmol of 2a, 1.0
mmol of 3, and 5–10 mmol of POCl3.

Further, we assessed the reaction of different
α-amino acids
(2b–f) with 1a and 3m to afford the title compounds. Notably, the selection of
amino acids too was influenced by their ability to form spirooxindole.11 Reaction of 1a and 3m with l-thioproline (2b) and sarcosine (2e) produced the corresponding products 5abm and 5aem in 68 and 77% yields, respectively (Scheme 6). However, the reaction with cis-4-hydroxy-d-proline (2c) and pipecolinic
acid (2d) resulted in a mixture of products, from which
the desired product could not be isolated. We ascertained that reaction
of 2c with 1a and 3m successfully
afforded spirooxindole as reported,11a but
further treatment with POCl3 produced a complex mixture
of products. Likewise, the reaction of glycine (2f) also
failed to furnish the desired product 5afm.

Scheme 6 Scope of
the Reaction with α-Amino Acids
All
reactions were performed
using 1.0 mmol of 1a, 1.0 mmol of 2a, 1.0
mmol of 3, and 5–10 mmol of POCl3.

Success with activated alkynes made it imperative
to probe the
reaction with activated alkenes as they too are known to afford spirooxindoles.6,12 Therefore, in a representative experiment, reaction of dimethyl
maleate (3p) with 1a and 2a was performed, which resulted in isolation of 5aam in
76% yield, but 2 days were required for reaction completion (Scheme 7). It was apparent
that an in situ oxidation occurred in the final step to afford the
observed product. Likewise, treating 1a and 2a with diethyl maleate (3q) led to the formation of 5aan in 2 days, establishing the generality of the protocol.
The scope was further investigated with 1,4-naphthoquinone (3r), benzylideneacetone (3s), and acrylonitrile
(3t) and, in all cases, the expected products 5aar, 5aas, and 5aat were isolated in 70–74%
yields. It is worth mentioning that the structure of 5aas was derived from the structure of the spirooxindole intermediate.12

Scheme 7 Scope of the Reaction with Activated Alkenes,
All
reactions were performed
using 1.0 mmol of 1a, 1.0 mmol of 2a, 1.0
mmol of 3, and 5–10 mmol of POCl3.

5aam = 5aap and 5aan = 5aaq.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a POCl3-mediated dehydrative
transformation of spirooxindoles into pyrido[2,3-b]indoles via ring expansion and construction of the pyridine ring.
The transformation could be executed from either spiroxindole or as
a two-step, one-pot protocol starting from isatin. This protocol,
which involves the use of readily available starting materials, is
versatile and accommodates terminal and activated internal alkynes
as well as alkenes. The presence of different functional groups such
as ester, nitrile, and acyl groups in the title compounds provides
the opportunity to expand them further for investigating different
biological activities. In this context, further work is underway to
develop new analogues of fused α-carbolines.

Experimental
Section
General Information
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
on precoated silica gel plates was used to monitor all reactions.
After elution, the TLC plate was visualized under UV illumination
at 254 nm. All melting points were recorded on a hot-stage apparatus
and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on an Fourier-transform
infrared spectrophotometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on Bruker 300, 400, and 500 MHz spectrometers,
using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Peak multiplicities
of NMR signals were designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet
of doublet), dt (doublet of triplet), t (triplet), q (quartet), or
m (multiplet). The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
images were recorded on an ion trap mass spectrometer. The high resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) images were recorded as ESI-HRMS images on
a quadrupole time-of-flight LC-MS/MS mass spectrometer. Commercial
grade reagents and solvents were used without further purification.
The title compounds obtained from 3p and 3q are 5aam and 5aan, respectively. Therefore,
there are no data for 5aap and 5aaq.

General
Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis of Spirooxindole
4 as Exemplified for 4aaa
In a round-bottom flask equipped
with a water condenser, were added isatin 1a (0.147 g,
1.0 mmol), l-proline 2a (0.115 g, 1.0 mmol),
phenylacetylene 3a (132 μL, 1.2 mmol), and CuI
(0.0095 g, 5 mol %) in 5 mL of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture
was refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h. After completion of
the reaction (as monitored by TLC), the reaction mixture was cooled
to room temperature and passed through a bed of celite. The filtrate
was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product,
which was purified by column chromatography over silica gel using
hexanes/EtOAc (30:70, v/v) as eluent to obtain 0.236 g (78%) of spirooxindole 4aaa as a yellow solid.

General Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis
of 2,3-Dihydro-1H-indolizino[5,6-b]indoles 5 as Exemplified
for 5aaa
A sealed tube charged with a mixture
of spirooxindole (4aaa) (0.151 g, 0.5 mmol) and POCl3 (234 μL, 2.5 mmol) was heated at 90 °C for 24
h under stirring. On completion of the reaction (as assessed by TLC),
the reaction mixture was neutralized by adding saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with EtOAc (50 mL × 2). The organic
layers were pooled, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated to obtain a crude product, which was purified by
column chromatography over silica gel using EtOAc/MeOH (80:20, v/v)
as eluent to obtain 0.122 g (86%) of 5aaa as a yellow
solid.

General Experimental
Procedure for the One-Pot, Two-Step Synthesis
of 2,3-Dihydro-1H-indolizino[5,6-b]indoles 5 as Exemplified for 5aaa
In a round-bottom
flask equipped with a water condenser were added isatin 1a (0.147 g, 1.0 mmol), l-proline 2a (0.115 g,
1.0 mmol), phenylacetylene 3a (132 μL, 1.2 mmol),
and CuI (0.0095 g, 5 mol %) in 5 mL of acetonitrile under nitrogen.
The mixture was heated at reflux temperature for 6 h. After completion
of the reaction (as monitored by TLC), the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure to obtain a crude product. To the crude product,
POCl3 (467 μL, 5.0 mmol) was added and the reaction
mixture was heated to 90 °C for 24 h under stirring. On completion,
the reaction mixture was neutralized by adding saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with EtOAc (75 mL × 2). The organic
layers were collected, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated to afford the crude product, which was purified
by column chromatography over silica gel using EtOAc/MeOH (80:20,
v/v) as eluent to obtain 0.199 g (70%) of 5aaa as a yellow
solid.

In a round-bottom
flask equipped with a water condenser were added isatin 1a (0.147 g, 1.0 mmol), α-amino acid 2 (1.0 mmol),
and dipolarophile 3 (1.0 mmol) in 5 mL of methanol, and
the mixture was heated at reflux temperature. After completion (as
monitored by TLC), the solvent was removed under reduced pressure
to obtain the crude product, to which POCl3 (5–10
mmol) was added, and the mixture was heated at 90 °C under stirring.
On completion (as assessed by TLC), the reaction mixture was neutralized
by adding saturated NaHCO3 solution and extracted with
EtOAc (75 mL × 2). The organic layers were combined, dried over
