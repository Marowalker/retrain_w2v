We demonstrate an ultrafast laser-ablated
hierarchically patterned
silver nanoparticle/graphene oxide (AgNP/GO) hybrid surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for highly sensitive and reproducible
detection of an explosive marker 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). A hierarchical
laser-patterned silver sheet (Ag–S) is achieved by ultrafast
laser ablation in air with pulse energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ.
Multiple laser pulses at a wavelength of 800 nm and a pulse repetition
rate of 50 fs at 1 kHz are directly focused on Ag–S to produce
and deposit AgNPs onto Ag–S. The surface morphology of ablated
Ag–S was evaluated using atomic force microscopy, optical profilometry,
and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). A rapid increase
in the ablation rate with increasing laser energy was observed. Selected
area Raman mapping is performed to understand the intensity and size
distribution of AgNPs on Ag–S. Further, GO was spin-coated
onto the AgNPs produced by ultrafast ablation on Ag–S. The
hierarchical laser-patterned AgNP/GO hybrid structure was characterized
using FESEM, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray
diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.
Further, hierarchical laser-patterned AgNP/GO hybrid structures have
been utilized as SERS-active substrates for the selective detection
of 2,4-DNT, an explosive marker. The developed SERS-active sensor
shows good stability and high sensitivity up to picomolar (pM) concentration
range with a Raman intensity enhancement of ∼1010 for 2,4-DNT. The realized enhancement of SERS intensity is due to
the cumulative effect of GO coated on Ag–S as a proactive layer
and AgNPs produced by ultrafast ablation.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique1 has emerged as a highly sensitive and selective
analytical tool for the identification of warfare agents,2 food safety inspection,3 medical diagnostics,4 and chemical/biological5 species at trace concentrations adsorbed on substrates
containing noble metal (Ag, Au, and Cu) nanostructured surfaces or
nanoparticles (NPs).6 Apart from sensitivity
and selectivity, several other factors such as ease of sample preparation,
nondestructive nature, real-time response, and label-free detection
of molecules of interest make SERS a versatile, cost-effective, and
acceptable technology for practical sensing applications.7 In the SERS-based analytical detection technique,
typically two major amplification mechanisms responsible for the Raman
intensity enhancement are reported: an electromagnetic enhancement
(EM) and a chemical enhancement (CE). EM originates from huge local
electric field because of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the nanostructured
metallic particles; on the other hand, CE contributes because of the
charge transfer between the SERS-active substrate and the molecule
of choice adsorbed on the surface.8−10 However, a significant
problem in using the SERS technique as a regular analytical tool capable
of detecting low concentration levels of an analyte is the development
of reusable, homogeneous, reproducible, cost-effective, and stable
SERS-active substrates. Because both the amplification mechanisms
contribute simultaneously in the Raman intensity enhancement, one
needs to fabricate SERS hybrid substrates which can utilize both amplification
mechanisms at the same time.

Recently, graphene and graphene
oxide (GO)/reduced GO (rGO)-based
carbon materials in combination with noble metals, particularly silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs)/nanostructures, have been used by many research
groups to improve the sensitivity, stability, and reproducibility
of the SERS substrates by protecting the AgNPs/nanostructures from
oxidation.11−15 GO has a 2D structure in which a uniform monolayer of carbon atoms
is arranged in a honeycomb crystal plane. Furthermore, graphene and
its derivatives are atomically flat, which provides excellent transmission
and efficient charge transfer because of the short distance between
the graphene/GO and the analyte molecule to be probed for SERS detection.
Also, being a florescent quencher, GO can be used as an active SERS
substrate for fluorescent molecules. Recently, Xu et al. demonstrated
various hybrid SERS substrates having a combination of metal NPs and
GO for the detection of adenosine and DNA molecules. For adenosine
detection, two different substrates having graphene-wrapped Cu NP
hybrids (G/Cu NP) prepared by chemical route16 and graphene-isolated AgNPs (G/AgNP) by using excimer laser were
used.17 Furthermore, they reported that
a graphene single-crystal domain patterned into multiple channels
could measure time- and concentration-dependent DNA hybridization
kinetics and affinity reliably and sensitively with a detection limit
of 10 pM for the DNA.18 Yang et al. have
proposed an SERS substrate based on silver-plated cicada wings with
a seamless graphene layer (GrAgNPs-C.w.). They have compared AgNPs-C.w.
and Gr-AgNPs-C.w. hybrids, which suggested that Gr-AgNPs-C.w. demonstrated
superior SERS performance with high sensitivity, good uniformity,
and good stability with R6G detection. The minimum detected concentration
was found to be 10–15 M.19

A lot of SERS-based research work has been reported on rGO-based
AgNP (rGO/AgNP) hybrid composites either in wet chemical phase or
on solid substrates.20−23 These rGO/AgNP hybrid structures show great potential as SERS-active
substrates because the charge transfer between the adsorbate and rGO
leads to chemical amplification mechanism; on the other hand, SPR
of AgNPs results in electromagnetic amplification.

Several researchers
have employed several bottom-up and top-down
micro–nano fabrication-based approaches to fabricate the SERS-active
substrate including core–shell nanowire array,24 self-assembled metal colloid monolayers,25 template method,26 self-assembly,27 nanosphere lithography,28 electron-beam lithography,29 nanoimprint
lithography,30 deep ultraviolet photolithography,31 and so on. Majority of these techniques mentioned
above are complicated, time-consuming, and/or expensive in nature
and need a huge infrastructure. The femtosecond (fs) laser-based ultrafast
ablation technique is a potential technique for rapid, facile, and
economical fabrication of nanostructured metallic ordered arrays over
large area. The femtosecond laser–material interaction has
recently been utilized as a fast and reproducible technique to obtain
hierarchically patterned nanostructured metal sheets on a large area
for SERS application.2 The surface morphology
of the metal sheet can be controlled by tuning various laser ablation
parameters such as average laser power, pulse width, scan rate, and
the surrounding medium such as liquid32 and air.33

Several research groups
have been working on the different properties
of femtosecond laser-ablated nanosheets (NSs) and NPs in air as well
as in liquid medium. Han et al. have demonstrated a facile laser scribing
method to fabricate AgNPs and GO-based biochips as a reusable SERS
sensor for DNA detection. They demonstrate direct patterning of SERS-sensitive
channels by programmable laser scribing of the AgNP/GO composite films,
which consist of graphene-supported AgNPs by exfoliating the composites
into hierarchically porous structures. On-chip SERS detection of a
30-base ssDNA samples at a concentration of 10–6 M has been achieved within 1 min.34 Ma
et al. fabricated SERS-active metallic micro–nano structures
by using femtosecond laser. In this work, they have used a series
of femtosecond laser-mediated fabrication strategies, including the
two-photon reduction of metal ions, template-assisted metal coating
and metal filling, photodynamic assembly of metal NPs, and selective
NP sintering. It was found that the femtosecond laser ablation method
plays a crucial role in the fabrication of metal nano/microstructures.
The fabrication of nano/microstructures with arbitrary shapes and
appropriate roughness with high resolution has been developed with
this technique.35 Yan et al. reported the
fabrication of rGO grating structures using two-beam laser interference
for the fabrication of SERS substrates via simple physical vapor deposition
coating of silver. Hierarchical rGO grating structures with microscale
gratings and nanoscale folders through a laser treatment-induced ablation
and photoreduction process have been achieved. Further, the prepared
rGO gratings were used for the detection of rhodamine B and a detection
limit of 10–10 M was achieved.36 Lu et al. demonstrated a sensitive, reproducible, and stable
3D plasmonic hybrid with bilayer WS2 as a nanospacer for
SERS analysis. They have fabricated an SERS substrate (AuNP/WS2@AuNPs hybrid) by inserting a bilayer film of WS2 as the nanospacer. A tight combination of WS2 film with
AuNPs was done by using thermal decomposition method. Rhodamine 6G
dye was detected with a minimum detection limit of 10–11 M.37

Li et al. reported a novel
SERS substrate based on GO/AgNP/Cu film-covered
silicon pyramid arrays by wet texturing technology to detect rhodamine-6G,
methylene blue (MB), and crystal violet (CV) on AgNP/PCu@Si and GO/AgNP/PCu@Si
substrates.38 The limit of detection was
found to be 10–15, 10–9, and 10–9 M for rhodamine-6G, MB, and CV. Byram et al. demonstrated
versatile gold-based SERS substrates fabricated by ultrafast laser
ablation for sensing of picric acid (PA) and ammonium nitrate (AN).
They accomplished the detection of AN, PA, rhodamine-6G (Rh6G), and
MB at 10–5, 10–6, 10–7, and 10–8 M concentrations by using AuNSs as the
SERS substrate fabricated through ultrafast laser ablation technique
in liquids.39 Bao et al. demonstrated ultrathin
tin oxide layer-wrapped gold NPs induced by laser ablation in solution-based
SERS substrate and their enhanced performances. In this work, they
presented a simple and flexible technique for the synthesis of ultrathin
semiconductor oxide layer-wrapped AuNPs. After laser ablation of Au
target in AuCl4 solutions, the size of the obtained AuNPs
was found to be 2 nm. The process of the formation of Au@SnO2 NPs involves two steps: the laser ablation-induced formation of
AuNPs and subsequent Coulomb effect-based colloidal attachment and
self-assembly on the AuNPs. It was found that the Au@SnO2 NP-built film shows stronger SERS effect to organic phosphor molecules
(phenyl phosphonic acid) and excellent performance in gas sensing
to H2S at room temperature compared with the bare AuNP
and pure SnO2 NP films, respectively.40 Dell’Aglio et al. reported the mechanisms and processes
of pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLALs) during NP production.
In this work, PLAL for the formation of NPs was studied by applying
different time-resolved diagnostic techniques, such as optical emission
spectroscopy, shadowgraph, laser scattering imaging, and DP-LAL (double-pulse
LAL) for laser-induced breakdown detection. The results demonstrated
that NPs are produced in the first stage of the PLAL process, that
is, during the plasma cooling. This observation clearly explains the
narrow distribution of size generally observed in NPs synthesized
by PLAL technique.41

Herein, we propose
a facile route for preparing SERS-active substrates
based on hierarchical laser-patterned Ag sheet/GO (AgNP/GO) hybrid
structure. Hierarchically patterned Ag sheets were achieved by ultrafast
laser ablation of Ag bulk sheet (Ag–S) in the air with different
laser energies (25, 50, and 100 μJ). Each laser-ablated Ag–S
was ascribed onto 5 × 5 mm2 area with an interablated
distance of 100 μm for the fabrication of hierarchical nanostructure.
Subsequently, well-synthesized GO was spin-coated on each nanostructured
Ag sheets to make AgNP/GO hybrid structure to prevent Ag nanostructures
from oxidation as well as to enhance the SERS intensity through charge
transfer. Developed hybrid structures were inspected using field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique.
Further, the hybrid structure has been used as a sensing platform
for SERS-based selective detection of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT),
an explosive marker, at different concentrations (10–3, 10–6, 10–9, and 10–12 M). A schematic of the fabrication of hierarchically patterned AgNP/GO
hybrid using femtosecond laser ablation and further SERS studies for
the detection of explosive marker 2,4-DNT is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic of the preparation
of AgNP/GO composite using femtosecond
laser ablation followed by SERS studies.

2 Results and Discussion
Laser ablation is a simple one-step
route to fabricate nanostructures
on solid thin metal sheets such as Ag, Au, and Cu either in air or
in liquid medium for SERS-active substrates with the added advantage
of high speed, low cost, and high throughput on large area.

2.1 Multiline Laser Ablation of Bulk Ag Sheet
An Ag sheet
(Ag–S) target of 1 mm thickness has been used
for the multiline ablation using ultrafast femtosecond laser in the
air with laser energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ. The surface roughness
of Ag–S has been measured in several spots across the 5 ×
5 mm2 area before ablation using AFM. The average surface
roughness (root mean square) is found to be 17 ± 2 nm (Figure S1). Further, laser ablation on Ag–S
with interspacing lines of 100 μm on 5 × 5 mm2 area has been performed. Figure 2 shows the schematic diagram of laser ablation process
on Ag–S using femtosecond laser. The laser pulses were scanned
across Ag–S at a speed of 0.1 mm/s and focused onto Ag–S
by a lens.

Figure 2 Schematic of multiline ultrafast laser ablation for AgNP deposition.

Laser ablation of Ag–S is a complicated
process to remove
and transport AgNPs. When the laser pulses with high enough energy
ablate Ag–S, the absorbed laser energy causes a breakdown of
the Ag–S target and formed plasma. The interaction between
the plasma species and the air molecules decreases the kinetic energy
of plasma species gradually, which promotes the aggression of plasma
species to form NPs. When an ultrafast fs laser pulse interacts with
the surface of Ag sheet, melting of the surface takes place at room
temperature. Because of this effect, the higher pressure was generated
at the surface of the Ag sheet, hence results in nanotexturing on
the surface. These NPs gradually release the kinetic energy during
transport and are deposited onto Ag–S because of the gravity
force. Further, Ag–S ablated at three different energies (25,
50, and 100 μJ) were examined using optical profilometry in
the noncontact mode as illustrated in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Profilometry images of laser-ablated AgNSs at
input energies of
(a) 25 (b) 50, and (c) 100 μJ.

Figure 3a–c
depicts the profilometry images of Ag–S ablated at 25, 50,
and 100 μJ, respectively. The images indicate that the ablated
depth increases with an increase in laser energy. Similarly, the ablated
width also increases with the increase in the laser energy, whereas
the remaining width between the two ablated lines decreases. Initially,
the distance between the two ablated lines (width) was 100 μm.
After ablation, the width starts to decrease because of melting (remaining
width).

Data in Figure 4a illustrate that the variation of ablated depth (d) with laser energy is almost linear. The inset of Figure 4a represents the
ablated depth
(d). It is evident from Figure 4a that the “d”
on Ag–S was 14 ± 2, 28 ± 2, and 37 ± 3 μm
at input laser energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ, respectively.

Figure 4 Variation
of (a) ablated depth and (b) ablated width between two
ablated lines with laser energy. The inset shows the definition of
“d” and “w”.

Figure 4b shows
the variation of ablated width with laser energy. The inset of Figure 4b represents the
distance between two ablated lines, the ablated width and the remaining
width. The dotted lines represent the ablated width (w) and the solid line represents the remaining width. The ablated
widths at 25, 50, and 100 μJ were found to be 12.5, 16.5, and
30 μm, respectively. This indicates that the “w” increases and the remaining width decreases with
increase in laser energy. The remaining width is found to be 75, 65,
and 40 μm at input laser energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ,
respectively. This is because as the laser energy is incident on the
surface of Ag–S, the point of contact heats up and melts. As
the laser energy increases, more and more heat energy is generated
at the point of interaction, which results in more melting of the
material and hence increasing the ablated width.

The surface
morphologies of the laser-ablated Ag–S at 25,
50, and 100 μJ energies have been investigated by FESEM and
the images are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a
shows the surface morphology of the pre-cleaned Ag–S before
laser ablation. The bulk Ag sheet (Ag–S) looks perfectly flat
with low roughness of around 17 nm (Figure S1), which can be seen from Figure 5a.

Figure 5 FESEM images of (a) Ag sheet, (b) Ag NS ablated at 25,
(c) 50,
and (d) 100 μJ laser energies. The insets show the AgNP formation
on the surface in region II.

The same Ag–S depicted in Figure 5a was ablated. Figure 5b shows that the surface of Ag–S ablated
by 25 μJ, found almost flat, similar to Ag–S before ablation
except close to the ablated lines, where small population of the ablated
AgNPs is found to be deposited after ablation. On the other hand,
in the case of 50 μJ, the density of the AgNPs was much higher
closer to the ablated lines and very few in the middle portion of
Ag–S as compared to the 25 μJ cases. However, in the
case of 100 μJ, most of the ablated AgNPs are found to be lying
in the middle portion of the Ag sheet because the ablated width between
the two ablated lines decreases with the increase in laser energy.
The variation in the ablated width due to laser energy can also be
seen in the profilometry data (Figure 4). The images of AgNPs have been shown in the inset
of Figure 5b–d,
along with ablated energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ. The insets
of Figure 5 clearly
show the shape and size of AgNPs generated in each case of ablation.

To understand the distribution of ablated AgNPs between the two
laser-ablated lines, FESEM images are divided into three regions for
each ablated Ag–S [Figure 5b–d] target as surface morphology plays a crucial
role in the SERS signals. Region I marked is close to the first ablated
line, region II marked is in the middle of the two ablated lines on
Ag–S, and region III marked close to the second ablated line.

It was observed that the density of AgNPs in regions I and III
increases gradually after ablation with 25 and 50 μJ energies,
and on the other hand, in region II, only few AgNPs could be seen
in the case of 50 μJ. However, in the case of 100 μJ energy,
the density of AgNPs over region II is maximum as compared to regions
I and III as most part of regions I and III melted during laser ablation.
The NP formation depends on the melt formed during femtosecond ablation
and the redeposition of this melt after the pulses have left. Because
the scanning speed utilized was 0.1 mm/s and the repetition rate being
1 kHz, there are several pulses interrogating the same area of the
surface. If we assume a spot size of 50 μm (100 μm), the
number of pulses hitting the same area will be 500 (1000). The interaction
of this number of pulses with the melt and redistribution would have
resulted in different morphologies of the NPs on the surface.

Figure 6 presents
the FESEM images of regions I, II, and III on Ag–S ablated
at 25, 50, and 100 μJ. It is also found that the size of the
AgNPs increases with the increase in laser energy. The FESEM images
were processed under ImageJ software. The average sizes of the AgNPs
in region II (25, 50, and 100 μJ) are estimated to be 54, 59,
and 62 nm.

2.2 Effect of Surface Morphology of the Ablated
Ag–S
The surface morphology of the deposited laser-ablated
NPs plays a vital role in the enhancement of the Raman signal of any
analyte molecule in the SERS technique.42 The morphology of AgNPs can produce a giant electric field through
the propagating surface plasmons on interaction with laser pulses
at a particular wavelength. To understand the effect of different
surface morphologies induced by laser ablation of different energies,
Raman mappings were performed for all the samples (Figure S2). The Raman spectra of Ag–S and laser-ablated
Ag–S at 25 μJ shows a group of bands in the range 700–1600
cm–1 region [Figure 7a]. The main vibrational bands were at 1579, 1377,
and 997 cm–1 and are generally assigned to the silver–oxygen
mode (AgO).43

Figure 7 (a) Raman spectra of
AgNPs, showing silver peaks on Ag sheet and
variation of Ag peaks in regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated Ag–S
obtained at 25 μJ of input laser energy; (b) variation of average
intensity counts in regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated Ag–S;
and (c) variation of intensities of 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1 signature peaks of Ag–O at regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated
Ag–S ablated at 25 μJ. “a.u.” stands for
arbitrary units in the figure.

To measure the Raman intensities in different regions, we have
chosen 30 × 30 μm2 area for each region between
two laser-ablated lines. We have recorded the Raman spectra at 10
different spots in each region and the average intensities are plotted. Figure 7 shows that the Raman
intensities vary between the regions which reflect the clear role
of the surface morphology. In order to produce a clearer picture,
specific peaks at 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1, for
Ag–S in Raman spectra, have been chosen from the mapped area
and average intensities of these peaks in each region are plotted. Figure 7b shows the variation
of average counts of AgNPs over laser-ablated Ag–S at 25 μJ
of laser energy. It is found that average counts are high and almost
similar at regions I and III, whereas in region II, the numbers of
counts are very less as compared to regions I and III. Figure 7c depicts that the bands at
991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1 were chosen as the signature
peaks of Ag–O on Ag–S. The intensity counts of these
peaks were plotted at different regions, and it was found that the
intensity of these peaks was higher at regions I and III as compared
to region II. Similar plots have been obtained for Ag–S ablated
at 50 and 100 μJ laser energies.

Figure 8 shows the
Raman spectra of Ag–S ablated at 50 μJ. Figure 8a shows the Raman spectra of
Ag–S ablated at 50 μJ of laser energy. Again, the three
signature peaks of AgNPs have been observed at 991, 1373, and 1579
cm–1. Figure 8b illustrates the variation of intensity counts over laser-ablated
Ag–S at 50 μJ of laser energy. It was found that the
intensity counts are high and almost similar at regions I and III,
whereas in region II, the number of AgNP intensity counts are very
less as compared to regions I and III but more than as observed in
the case of 25 μJ. Figure 8c depicts the variation of intensity counts of the
signature peaks of AgNPs at 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1.

Figure 8 (a) Raman spectra of AgNPs, showing silver peaks on Ag sheet and
variation of Ag peaks in regions I, II, and III on laser ablated Ag–S
obtained at 50 μJ of input laser energy; (b) variation of average
intensity counts in regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated Ag–S;
and (c) variation of intensities of 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1 signature peaks of Ag–O at regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated
Ag–S ablated at 50 μJ. “a.u.” stands for
arbitrary units in the figure.

Figure 9a shows
the Raman spectra of Ag–S ablated at 100 μJ of input
laser energy. Again, the three signature peaks of AgNPs were observed
at 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1. Figure 9b shows the variation of intensity counts
over laser-ablated Ag–S at 100 μJ energy. It is evident
that the intensity counts are almost similar in all regions I, II,
and III. Figure 9c
shows the variation of intensity counts of the signature peaks of
AgNPs at 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1. These results
established that the surface morphology plays a significant role in
enhancing the Raman signals. The above results indicate that regions
I and III show similar behavior, and, therefore, instead of mentioning
regions I and III, they will further be treated as region I.

Figure 9 (a) Raman spectra
of Ag–S, showing silver peaks on Ag sheet
and variation of Ag peaks; (b) variation of average intensity counts
in regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated Ag–S obtained at
100 μJ of input laser energy, and (c) variation of intensities
of 991, 1373, and 1579 cm–1 signature peaks of silver
NPs at regions I, II, and III on Ag–S ablated at 100 μJ.
“a.u.” stands for arbitrary units in the figure.

The above experimental SERS results clearly proved
that the morphology
of the laser-ablated regions of silver plays a crucial role on the
Raman signals. Because the ablation was performed in ambient air,
the energy-dependent ablation has resulted in a nonuniform distribution
of the AgNPs on the surface (with varying sizes, numbers, and shapes)
depend on the region of observation. The groove formed due to ablation
can also be used for SERS studies, but the depth did not permit us
in recording the Raman spectra. Regions I and III seem to have similar
morphologies (sizes and numbers) for energies up to 50 μJ. However,
for the 100 μJ case, the enhancement was found to be uniform
across the regions. This is a significant result because the number
of “hotspots” generated will be different in each case.
Assuming that the generated NPs are hemispherical in nature, the sizes
and the distances between these NPs (density) will influence the Raman
signal. Therefore, by varying the input energy, one could obtain,
in principle, a variety of morphologies with different-sized NPs and
densities, which in turn results in different enhancements. This NP
formation on the surface is unique to femtosecond pulse ablation unlike
in nanosecond ablation where the heat-affected zones are prominent
and the longer pulse results in physical melting (no NP formation).
Further, performing the ablation in a liquid will create a different
morphology and will be investigated in our future studies.

2.3 GO Synthesis
The synthesized GO was
characterized by different techniques such as FESEM, Raman spectroscopy,
XRD, and FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 10a illustrates the FESEM image of GO which indicates
the exfoliation of GO in layered form.

Figure 10 (a) FESEM image, (b)
Raman spectra, (c) XRD, and (d) FTIR spectra
of GO.

Figure 10d shows
the FTIR spectra of GO, which gives the functional groups of GO as
discussed in various literature studies and hence confirms the well-synthesized
form of GO. Figure 10b depicts the Raman spectra of GO which shows the signature peaks
of GO at 1350 and 1590 cm–1. These peaks are named
D band and G band. The D band is assigned to the disordered band responsible
for the structural defects and dangling sp2 carbon bonds,
whereas the G peak is due to the in-plane stretching motion between
sp2 carbon atoms. Figure 10b illustrates the 2D band of GO between 2500 and 3000
cm–1, which shows two lumps indicating two layers
of graphene in GO.5 In Figure 10b, the intensity of the D
band is higher than that of G band, which is due to the disruption
of sp2 bonds of carbon as GO has oxidative functional groups. Figure 10c shows the XRD
spectra of GO, which indicates the sharp peak of GO at 2θ =
8.3°, which confirms the formation of GO. Further, the AFM studies
were performed to verify the thickness of GO. The thickness of each
graphene layer was found to be around 2.4 nm, which is slightly higher
because of the presence of oxygen functional groups. Further, the
intensity ratio for (ID/IG) is found to be 1.1 and full width at half-maximum for
D and G bands are found to be 159 and 85, respectively. Further, the
synthesized GO was spin-coated on the surface of laser-ablated Ag–S.

2.4 SERS Measurements
Laser-textured
silver/GO (AgNP/GO) hybrid has been used as a substrate for analyte
detection. We have chosen 2,4-DNT as an explosive marker molecule
to investigate the performance of the developed SERS-active substrate
using a range of solution concentrations (10–6,
10–9, and 10–12 M). 2,4-DNT is
a marker molecule for the explosive trinitrotoluene and, hence, the
material of choice in the present study. Besides, it is also used
as a nitroaromatic explosive and has a low vapor pressure; therefore,
its detection at low concentration is of utmost importance.

Figure 11 shows the
SERS spectra of 2,4-DNT on AgNP/GO at 25 μJ at 10–12 M concentration. 2,4-DNT is an explosive compound which can be used
as a marker for land mine detection. The observed Raman bands at 791,
866, and 911 cm–1 correspond to the stretching modes
of NO2, whereas the band at 1130 cm–1 is assigned to the H–C–H asymmetric bending movement.
The vibrational mode assigned to the H–C–C in-plane
bending movement appears at 1202 cm–1, two bands
at 1353 and 1573 cm–1 correspond to the D and G
bands of GO, and are found to be matching with the reported peaks
in the literature.44−47

“a.u.” stands for arbitrary units in the figure.

To check the reproducibility of the substrate and
to compensate
the thickness and defect variations on AgNP/GO substrate area due
to spin coating, the intensity ratio (I/ID) of the 866 cm–1 peak, where I is the intensity of 866 cm–1 band and ID is the intensity of the D band on AgNP/GO
substrate, was calculated. The intensities I and ID were calculated by averaging 10 different
spots on the AgNP/GO substrate. The variation of I/ID ratio is plotted against different
concentrations of 2,4-DNT (Figure S3),
which indicates the linear dependence of I/ID on concentrations.

Figure 13a–c
shows the variation of intensities of 866, 791, and 911 cm–1 peaks of 2,4-DNT in regions I and II on AgNP/GO hybrid ablated at
25, 50, and 100 μJ laser energies. Figure 13d shows the variation of intensity versus
energy of the laser of 866 cm–1 peak of 2,4-DNT
in regions I and II. It demonstrates a linear increase in intensities
with an increase in laser energy.

Figure 13 Variation of intensities of 866, 791,
and 911 cm–1 peaks of 2,4-DNT at regions I and II
on AgNP/GO ablated at (a) 25,
(b) 50, and (c) 100 μJ laser energy and (d) variation of intensities
vs laser energy of 866 cm–1 peak at regions I and
II.

It is also observed that the intensity
of 866 cm–1 peak in region II of AgNP/GO is equally
high at 100 μJ of
laser energy. It shows that the AgNP/GO substrate acts as a good sensor
with pM detection limit with good reproducibility. The other peaks
at 791, 911, 1130, and 1202 cm–1 demonstrate a similar
behavior as shown by 866 cm–1 peak. It is interesting
to note that at 100 μJ, the SERS intensity from 2,4-DNT is almost
equal for regions I and III, indicating the disappearance of region
II because of deposition of AgNPs far away from the ablation region.
This observation is supported by the FESEM image of 50 and 100 μJ
samples (Figure 5),
as well as from Figure 9b, which demonstrates the variation of average intensity counts in
regions I, II, and III on laser-ablated Ag–S at 100 μJ.
This suggests that the appropriate size of the AgNPs can be achieved
for energies up to 100 μJ and no further ablation is necessary
to get AgNPs of required size. Further, increasing the laser energy,
AgNPs produced will be larger in size, which may not be useful for
the plasmon resonance condition, necessary for LSPR generation in
SERS measurements.

2.5 Analytical Enhancement
Factors
To
check the performance of the well-fabricated AgNP/GO substrate, the
average enhancement factor (AEF) has been calculated for 2,4-DNT.
The AEF in SERS Raman spectra was calculated using the following equation 1  where ISERS is
the SERS band intensity of 2,4-DNT using the synthesized AgNP/GO substrate, IR is the Raman intensity of an analyte on a
glass slide (without using substrate), CSERS represents the corresponding concentration of an analyte on a substrate
(10–12 M), and CR is
the concentration of an analyte on a glass slide (10–3 M, without substrate), which produces the Raman signal, IR. The calculated AEF values for 2,4-DNT on
AgNP/GO substrate at 25, 50, and 100 μJ in regions I and II
are found to be 1.10 × 1010, 2.14 × 1010, and 2.18 × 1010 and 7.79 × 109,
1.15 × 1010, and 2.12 × 1010 (866
cm–1 peak), respectively. The comparative enhancement
factors of regions I and II are shown in the histogram given in Figure 14. As discussed
earlier, because of deposition of AgNPs far away from the actual ablation
region, there is hardly any difference in the enhancement factor for
structures obtained at 100 μJ. Our SERS measurements clearly
indicate that the hierarchical laser-patterned AgNP/GO substrate can
detect 2,4-DNT at significantly low concentrations of 10–12 M.

Figure 14 Comparison of the enhancement factors of 2,4-DNT on AgNP/GO substrate
obtained at three different laser energies of 25, 50, and 100 μJ
in regions I and II of the substrate.

The higher detection limit of the developed AgNP/GO substrate may
be due to the good interaction of the 2,4-DNT molecules electromagnetically
as well as chemically. Further, to check the effect of spreading area
on the silver sheet, we recorded the Raman spectra of 2,4-DNT on Ag–S
keeping the same protocols as taken on the glass slide (i.e., volume:
2 μL of 10–3 M 2,4-DNT solution). The Raman
intensities were obtained by averaging data from 10 different spots
over the surface of Ag–S and AgNP/GO hybrid, and the cross-sectional
area of laser spot was ∼500 nm. Further, the Raman spectra
of Ag–S and glass slide were compared and the enhancement factor
was calculated. The Raman spectra of 2,4-DNT were recorded on plain
Ag–S with and without GO and compared with the Raman spectra
of 2,4-DNT on AgNP/GO substrate at regions I and II ablated at 25,
50, and 100 μJ of laser energy (Figure S4).

Table S1 (given in the Supporting Information) summarizes the enhancement factors calculated on plain Ag–S
and plain glass sheet. As shown in Table S1, it was found that the enhancement factor on Ag–S is 1 order
of magnitude lower than that on the glass slide. The difference in
the enhancement factors may be due to the difference in the spreading
areas on different substrates. Further, the performance of the AgNP/GO
hybrid substrate fabricated by laser ablation for explosive marker
detection (2,4-DNT) has been evaluated with earlier reported SERS
substrates fabricated by various approaches. We have compared different
SERS substrates with their enhancement factors, as shown in Table
S2 (given in the Supporting Information). The enhancement factor achieved by other authors was in the range
of 105 to 108. However, the enhancement factor
achieved by our substrate is found to be ∼109, which
is comparable or even superior to the other reported literature.2,32,48−50 Furthermore,
we have repeated the SERS experiment on the same substrate at different
intervals of time (as prepared, after 2 weeks, and finally after 1
month) and did not find significant changes in the Raman intensity
of the 2,4-DNT molecules investigated. This clearly indicates that
the stability of the developed sensor is quite good.

3 Conclusions
In the present work, we
have fabricated and demonstrated a generic SERS sensor based on a
hierarchical laser-patterned AgNP/GO hybrid structure to detect 2,4-DNT
molecules successfully. Ag sheet has been ablated by a femtosecond
laser at three different laser energies, 25, 50, and 100 μJ,
to fabricate and deposit AgNPs along the ablated trench, which were
later successfully incorporated with GO to form the AgNP/GO hybrid
structure. The fabricated AgNP/GO hybrid behaves as an extremely sensitive
SERS substrate for the detection of 2,4-DNT analyte with three different
concentrations in the picomolar range. The calculated AEF values for
2,4-DNT on AgNP/GO substrate at 25, 50, and 100 μJ in regions
I and II are found to be 1.10 × 1010, 2.14 ×
1010, and 2.18 × 1010 and 7.79 × 109, 1.15 × 1010, and 2.12 × 1010 (866 cm–1 peak), respectively. We have compared
the enhancement factor of 2,4-DNT on Ag–S with a glass slide
on the AgNP/GO hybrid. The enhancement factors at regions I and II
on Ag–S are 2.74 × 109 and 1.93 × 109; 5.31 × 109 and 2.47 × 109; and 5.41 × 109 and 5.26 × 109 for
25 μJ, for 50, and 100 μJ, respectively, calculated for
866 cm–1 peak. It was found that the enhancement
factor on Ag–S is 1 order of magnitude less than that on the
glass slide.

The AgNP/GO hybrid substrate demonstrated a remarkable
enhancement
in the SERS intensity even at ultralow analyte concentration. The
generic SERS sensor thus fabricated has immense potential to be used
as a portable explosive detector, owing to its sensing specificity
and sensitivity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials Used
All the chemicals
and reagents used in our study are of AR grade. Ag target (Ag–S)
of 1 mm thickness (≥99% pure), pristine graphite powder, and
2,4-DNT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and concentrated sulfuric
acid (H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were
procured from Samir Tech, India. The chemicals and reagents used in
this work were used as received without any further treatment. Deionized
water was used for the SERS sample preparation and cleaning purposes
throughout all the experiments.

4.2 Laser
Ablation of the Silver Sheet (Ag–S)
AgNPs were produced
through the laser ablation using a femtosecond
(fs) laser amplifier (Ti:sapphire, LIBRA, Coherent) delivering ∼50
fs pulses with a repetition rate of 1 kHz with a central wavelength
of 800 nm. The laser beam was focused using a convex lens of 100 mm
focal length at normal incidence onto the bulk silver target (Ag–S,
5 × 5 mm2) in ambient air. A computer-controlled motorized XY stage was used to translate the sample along X- and Y-directions with the speed of 0.1
mm/s and with the step size of 0.1 mm. The laser ablation experiments
were performed with three different pulse energies of 25, 50, and
100 μJ to understand the role of laser energy in ablation process.
In all the cases, the typical ablation time was ∼30 min. Further,
AgNPs fabricated onto Ag–S by laser ablation were investigated
using FESEM and AFM for evaluating the surface morphology. Selected
area Raman mapping was performed to understand the distribution of
AgNPs on Ag–S before using them for SERS substrate preparation.

4.3 Synthesis of GO
GO used in this work
was synthesized using simple Hummer’s method.16 The details of the synthesis process are provided in our
previous work.50 Further, synthesized GO
was characterized by using FESEM, XRD, FTIR, and HRTEM techniques
before using it for SERS substrate preparation.

4.4 Instrumentation
Surface morphology
images of the AgNPs were obtained using FESEM with a Supra 40 VP,
Carl Zeiss, attached with an energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyzer
(OXFORD EDAX). Surface roughness was measured using an atomic force
microscope, Asylum Research, MFP-3D origin, operated at a drive frequency
of 137.9 kHz in 2 μm scan size at a scan rate of 0.88 Hz. XRD
spectra of synthesized GO were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer
(45 kV, 40 mA) (X’pert PRO from PANalytical, Netherlands) with
Cu Kα radiation (μ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range
of 5°–90° at a scanning rate of 2° min–1. FTIR spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer, USA FTIR microscope
to investigate the functional groups present in GO. The SERS Raman
intensity of Ag–S, AgNPs, and 2,4-DNT explosive marker was
recorded with a Raman spectrometer (WiTec CRM 2000 Raman spectrometer,
Germany), attached with a He–Ne laser excitation source (wavelength
of 532 nm, focused via a 20×, 0.4 NA microscope objective). The
integration time and spectral resolution for all the samples were
kept at 5 s and 1 cm–1, respectively, to reduce
the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the spectral quality. Raman
mapping was performed on the 90 × 90 μm2 area
with a scanning speed of 0.1 s/pixel, and 225 pixels were scanned
in a line. Three sets/batches of the substrate were prepared to check
the reproducibility of the results for 2,4-DNT explosive marker. The
SERS Raman intensity measurements were done on 10 different spots
across the prepared substrate.

4.5 Sample
Preparation for SERS Substrate
The amount of GO was optimized
at 2.5 mg (complete details are provided
in our previous work) to get the uniform and homogeneous distribution
of GO on laser-ablated nanostructures.50 Different concentrations (10–3, 10–6, 10–9, and 10–12 M) of 2,4-DNT
solutions were prepared in 10 mL of ethanol. Further, GO solution
was prepared in 10 mL of ethanol. The prepared GO solution (10 μL)
was then spin-coated onto precleaned Ag–S ablated at three
different laser energies (25, 50, and 100 μJ) at 500 rpm for
20 s. The AgNP/GO spin-coated substrate was dried for 10 minutes on
a hot plate kept at 50 °C. Different concentrations of 2,4-DNT
(2 μL) were then spin-coated on the surface of the AgNP/GO substrate
at 500 rpm for 20 s and then the solvent was allowed to evaporate
at room temperature for adsorption. Spin coating the solution leads
to a uniform distribution of 2,4-DNT because of very fast and uniform
evaporation of solvent on the surface of the AgNP/GO SERS substrate.
The SERS spectra acquisition was started immediately after evaporation
of the solvent.
