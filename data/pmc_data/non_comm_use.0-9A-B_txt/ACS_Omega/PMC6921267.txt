Silicon
carbide (SiC) is an effective catalyst for generating fuel
from organics through gasification. SiC has shown promising results
as a catalyst due to its extraordinary thermal and oxidation resistance
abilities. Researchers are yet to identify an efficient silicon carbide
composite material that enhances the desired quality of fuel/liquid
production. The present study deals with in situ synthesis of fluorine-doped
silicon carbide using agriculture waste. Biochar, a waste by-product
from the gasification process, proved to be a potential carbon source
for fabrication of silicon carbide nanowires (SiCNWs). Pristine SiCNWs
exhibited nanospheres and freestanding nanowire (coiled, rods, bamboolike,
or hexagonal prism) structures with transversal optical mode indexed
to the β-phase (β-SiC). Fabrication of fluorine (F)-doped
SiC from a silica–carbon–fluorine (SiOx/Cy/Fz) precursor resulted in uneven flat-surfaced silicon carbide materials
accompanied by progressive pore blockage with increasing F-content.
Pore blockage was confirmed by declining the surface area from 60.70
m2 g–1 of the lowest dopant to 17.33
m2 g–1 of the maximum dopant, compared
to neat SiC (63.20 m2 g–1). Introduction
of fluorine led to decreased silicon contents and collapsed nanowire
while the carbon and oxygen contents increased.

Introduction
Silicon carbide (SiC) is a class of materials
that exhibit one-dimensional
(1D) polymorphism. It has over 250 polytypes, but the most popular
among these are the wide-band-gap α-SiC and β-SiC.1−3 In comparison, β-SiC with zinc blende structure has relatively
fewer uses than α-SiC. Over the years, silicon carbides have
received considerable attention as potential semiconductors in fabricating
high technological electronic devices operating at high frequencies,
high power, or high temperatures and high radiation; catalytic supports;
and reinforcements in ceramic matrix composites and metal matrix composites.2,4−6 Their outstanding material properties have made SiC
strategic and biocompatible materials. High thermal conductivity,
high electric field breakdown strength, excellent mechanical properties,
high chemical and thermal stabilities, and unique optical properties
exhibited by SiC are some of the advantages that made SiC and its
composites favorable semiconductors in numerous applications.4−7

Successful methods used for fabricating SiC nanostructured
materials
include arc discharge, chemical vapor deposition, carbothermal reduction,
and sol–gel methods, amongst others.8−10 Synthetic routes
are in some instances catalyst assisted11 or catalyst free12 and have produced
various SiC morphological nanostructures. Although efforts have been
made to synthesize SiC nanostructures with controlled shape through
either pressure variation of precursors13 or reaction temperature variation,14 morphological
control of SiC nanostructures as well as the use of expensive catalysts,
raw materials, and sophisticated techniques by most of the synthetic
methods mentioned above pose challenges on the large-scale production
of SiC.9 The need to use affordable raw
materials as the carbon source for SiC production is gaining attention
over nonrenewable engineered carbon sources such as carbon black,
activated carbon, hydrocarbon gases, graphite, carbon nanotubes, and
polymers.7,15,16 The use of
renewable materials17,18 as unconventional carbon sources
in the fabrication of carbide nanostructures is being considered although
their application is still in the minimal scale compared to nonrenewable
sources.

One of the important applications is in the field of
catalysis,
where the surface properties such as surface area and porosity are
prime features that display the catalytic efficiency. To achieve the
efficiency of silicon carbide, many dopants especially transitional
metal ions such as iron and cobalt have been used.6,7,15,18,19 In this report, we wish to investigate and understand
the effect of fluorine via in situ doping during the formation of
SiC. The study of effects of fluorination has been better reported
in silicon nanowires than in silicon carbide nanowires (SiCNWs).3 Fluorination is one of the important reactions
in carbon-containing materials like SiC, in which it serves as the
chemical modification route and can result in diverse electronic structures.
Fluorine-based dry etching of bulk SiC is being explored for widening
the SiC applications and device fabrications.3,20

In this work, silicon carbide has been prepared from the biochar
of biomass materials as the carbon source through a metal catalyst
and template-free carbothermal reduction of sol–gel-derived
silica. To assess the impact of halogen incorporated into the lattice
of silicon carbide influencing the overall material properties, a
fluorine dopant was introduced during the synthesis of SiC nanostructures
as a case study. The incorporation of a halide in the SiC matrix was
done using NH4F to make a random chemical composition of
SixCyFz. The SiC was synthesized using biochar obtained
from the gasification process and polysiloxane generated in situ from
sol–gel technology. The proximate analyses of biochar, determined
in triplicate through the ASTM method (ASTM D1762-84), showed 82%
of fixed carbon available to react with polysiloxane.

Results and Discussion
Upon carbothermal reduction at 1400 °C in an argon atmosphere,
the following reactions 1–6 take place, giving rise to SiC nanowires
along with cristobalite and amorphous carbon.21 1   2   3   4   5  Overall reaction 6  The β-SiC formed has shown
nanowire
dominance of 3C-SiC (dominance) prevalence and 6H SiC, with stacking
faults as reported earlier. However, ammonium fluoride when incorporated
into the system deteriorated the growth of SiC and gave rise to flat
layered structures with gradual reduction of nanowires. The temperature
used for the reaction was 1400 °C, and the decomposition of ammonium
fluoride at ∼100 °C cannot be ignored as per reactions 7 and 8(22) 7   8  Gaseous ammonia (NH3)
and hydrogen
fluoride (HF) generated at low temperatures of ∼100 °C
are important components from reactions 7 and 8, respectively. The presence
of HF causes typical dissolution of oxides through adsorption of F
species on the surface of the oxide layer. This makes Si–O–Si
bonds to be unstable under a HF environment due to the bond attack
by fluoride species. Reaction of these components with the silica
precursor may lead to the formation of intermediate products such
as the SiO2–NH3 complex and silica tetrafluoride
(SiF4) that would eventually reduce the silicon ion concentration
from the precursor and subsequently SiO reductive vapors, required
for the formation of SiC. The probable reactions giving rise to products
responsible for depleting these precursors are given in reactions 9 and 10(23) 9   10  SiO2–NH3 and
SiF4 byproducts are expected to occupy the available pores
as evidenced from a significant decrease in porosity and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area as discussed later. The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) absorption peak of fluorine-doped silica (Si–F stretching
bond) fabricated at temperatures <400 °C is observed around
the 850–1000 cm–1 region.24 Such temperatures are imperative for stabilization of fluorine
bonds. However, the spreading of strong Si–N and Si–O–S
absorptions along 750–1100 and 800–200 cm–1 regions, respectively,25,26 tends to obscure the
Si–F absorption peak of interest. The high volatility of fluorine
at a temperature of ∼450 °C minimizes the absorption modes
signifying the presence of fluorine compounds. The Si–H (str,
∼2100 cm–1), N–H (bending, 1150 cm–1), and Si–N (str, ∼860 cm–1) peak modes in Figure 2c vanishes at temperatures >800 °C or may be observed under
newly formed bonds. The high carbothermal reduction temperatures (1400
°C) of as-prepared fluorine-doped silica-biochar (SiOx/Cy/Fz) composites could not allow condensation and settling
of the SiO2–NH3 complex. The low-temperature-stable
complex may have retarded the SiC nuclei initiation and growth but
does not prevent the process completely. This is confirmed by a low
amount of grown SiCNWs observed on fluorine-doped samples, the presence
of Si–F (str, 953 cm–1) in the reduced peak
intensity when compared to those fabricated at moderate temperature,24 and reduction in peak intensities of Si–O
(str, 1078 cm–1) modes of all fluorine-modified
materials.

Influence of the Dopant on the Internal Structure of Silicon
Carbide
Microstructures of carbothermally reduced SiC materials
are presented in Figure 1. Figure 1a reveals
that the structural morphology of SiC consists of nanospheres and
nanowires (SiCNWs). SiCNWs are freestanding and randomly orientated
as either coiled fibers, smooth rods, bamboolike, or hexagonal prism
structures. Hexagonal prism structures and bamboolike nanowires exhibit
stacking fringes or stacking faults (SFs). The rods depict the SiC
core–shell structure coated by a SiO2 layer (∼15
nm, thickness). Diameters and lengths showed no uniformity with diameters
ranging from ∼47 to 95 nm (granules), ∼38–138
nm (rods), and ∼154 nm (hexagonal prism), while the length
of the nanowires range from 127 nm to few 10 μm. SiC structures
observed in Figure 1a′ corroborates with Figure 1a, illustrating no interlacing or hollowed nanowires.

Typical flat end features denoting catalyst-free derived silicon
carbides are depicted.27 Microscopic images
of SiC–F-doped materials in Figure 1b,c,b′,c′ support each other
and show collapsing of SiCNW structures with traces of few. Uneven
surfaces (rich in Si and O contents) covering underlying agglomerated
nanograins are observed (b′, c′), confirmed by elemental
compositions and mapping (EDS). The amount of F-contents was negligibly
low, and in other materials, none could be detected.

X-ray Diffraction
(XRD) Studies
The diffraction pattern
of SiC (neat) in Figure 2a depicts β-SiC peaks with corresponding
lattice planes, at 2θ = 35.8° (111), 43.4° (200),
60.2° (220), 72.0° (311), and 75.6° (222) [JCPD card
no. 03-065-0360]. A broad peak at 2θ = 25.9° is indexed
to SiO2 (quartz) [JCPD card no. 01-073-3466] and C [JCPD
card no. 03-065-0360], while a peak at 2θ = 33.8° is attributed
to stacking faults. The interplanar spacing between two adjacent lattice
fringes was obtained to be 0.25 nm. Fluorine-doped materials exhibit
changes that include decreasing intensities of β-SiC characteristic
peaks (2θ = 35.8, 43.4, and 60.2°) and additional SiO2 and amorphous C (graphite)28 trace
peaks. The decreasing peak intensities of planes indicate the degrading
crystalline quality of SiC–F materials with increasing F-dopants.
Noticeable peaks at 2θ = 31.0, 28.6, ∼27.0, and 22.0°
are ascribed to SiO2 and an intense sharp peak at 22.0°
is ascribed to SiO2 (cristobalite) and C (graphite). Shallow
peaks at ∼10.0° of SiC–F (0.50) and SiC–F
(1.00) correlate with the (111) plane of carbon, as reported.29

spectra
of SiC (neat) and its fluorine-doped derivatives.

FTIR Analyses
FTIR absorption peaks illustrated by
an undoped SiC spectrum (Figure 2b) depict the typical Si–C stretching vibration
at 798 cm–1 (an indicative of the transverse optical
(TO) mode of the SiC crystal), Si–O of Si–OCH2 symmetric stretching and Si–OH bending modes at 749 and 868
cm–1 indicates the unreacted silica, and Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching of bridging absorbance and Si:C–H2 rocking/wagging modes are observed at 1080 cm–1. The strength of the 1080 cm–1 peak mode corresponds
to the silica sheath on SiC nanowires and the granule surface. Other
peaks at 1430 cm–1 denote Si–CH2 or Si–CH3 bending modes, 1900 cm–1 depicts C=C, 2090 and 2275 cm–1 depict
Si–Hn and O3Si–H
stretching modes respectively, and 1700 and 2515 cm–1 are attributed to the C=O stretching and C–O (of carbonyl),
respectively. A broad band in the ∼2800–3400 cm–1 region depicts the C–H modes of alkanes and
alkenes, and O–H modes of Si–O–H and water molecules.
F-doped spectra illustrate the disappearance of peaks in the 1450–3100
cm–1 region, comprising mostly of Si–H, C–O,
and −OH. F-doped spectra exhibit peaks denoting the N–H
stretching of 2°-amines (a characteristic of weak aliphatic amines)
at 3319 cm–1, N–CH and Si–CH2 bending modes at 1422 cm–1, a Si–O–Si
asymmetric stretching out-of-plane shoulder peak at 1192 cm–1, and a strong in-plane peak at 1078 cm–1. The
intensity of the Si–C peak at 798 cm–1 decreases
with increasing F-dopant. A growing peak at 953 cm–1 is attributed to Si–F,30 while
the 714 cm–1 mode denotes −N–C–F
with increasing F-dopants.

Raman Analyses
Raman spectra of
pyrolysed-oxidized
SiC (neat) and SiC–F-doped materials analyzed are shown in Figure 2d. The SiC (neat)
spectrum depicts peaks at 798 cm–1 (sharp), 940
cm–1 (broad), 1370 cm–1, and 1596
cm–1, attributed to the SiC transverse optical (TO)
mode, longitudinal optical (LO) mode, and D band and G band for carbon,
respectively. The D band is normally attributed to the presence of
amorphous and disorder in carbon-derived materials, while the G band
originates from the in-plane tangential stretching of the carbon–carbon
bonds. Dominance of the G band over the D band in the SiC (neat) spectrum
suggests the prevalence of the ordered in-plane stretching motion
between sp2 carbon atoms in SiC (neat). SiC–F (0.50)
depicts the typical silica peaks at ∼420 and 485 cm–1. The peaks denote the bending mode of oxygen with identical distortions
of neighboring Si–O bonds (R line) in n-membered
rings (n > 4) and defects in the silica lattice
due
to the formation of four-membered rings (D1 line), respectively.
The absence of a vibration peak at 600 cm–1 confirms
the existence of solution-derived mesoporous silica.31 Introduction of F-dopants affects the D and G band positions
and intensities.

D and G peak positions of SiC–F (0.25),
SiC–F (0.50), and SiC–F (1.00) are (1362 and 1616 cm–1), (1360 and 1608 cm–1), and (1356
and 1610 cm–1), respectively. The Raman D/G band
intensity ratio is used to determine the graphitic nature of carbon.
The intensity ratios of the D peak over the G peak (ID/IG), from normalized Raman
spectra, gave ID/IG = 0.87 for neat SiC, while those of SiC–F (0.25),
SiC–F (0.50), and SiC–F (1.00) fluorinated samples were
1.50, 1.44, and 1.30, respectively. When compared to the neat SiC
spectrum, the fluorine-modified spectra showed reduced G band intensities
with increased D-band intensities, which confirms the existence of
structural defects of carbons in SiC-based materials.

BET Analyses
Figure 3a–d
presents the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm measurements of pyrolysed samples. The BET surface areas
(BET-SAs) of pyrolysed samples were found to be 63.20 m2 g–1 [SiC neat], 60.70 m2 g–1 [SiCF (0.25)], 23.39 m2 g–1 [SiCF (0.50)],
and 17.33 m2 g–1 [SiCF (1.00)], illustrating
a declining order with an increase in the F-content. These materials
exhibit type-IV N2 adsorption isotherms. Pore-size distributions
(PSDs) were calculated via the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method using the adsorption isotherm. PSDs (3a′–d′)
affirm the existence of micropores (diameter <2 nm) and prolific
mesopores in the 2–30 nm range.

Figure 3 Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm.
(a–d) BET-SAs and (a′–d′) PSDs with respective
enlarged insets of (a′–c′).

The declining order of PSD suggests the closing up of mesopores
with subsequent slow movement of N2 molecules at 77 K through
narrow pores. Reduced pore volume results in kinetically limited adsorption
of the N2 adsorbate. Adsorption–desorption isotherms
depict 3H type of hysteresis for SiC (neat) and 4H type for SiCF (0.25),
which are associated with slit-shaped pores and narrow slit pores,
respectively.32 SiC–F (0.50) and
SiC–F (1.00) present open hysteresis at low relative pressures, P/P0 = 0.15, suggesting possible
chemisorption of N2 on the highest F-containing products.

Conclusions
In conclusion, biochar was used to form organic–inorganic
hybrids with polysiloxane derived from sol–gel technology.
Carbothermal reduction of as-prepared silica-biochar produced
silicon carbide nanowires indexed to the β-phase with various
morphological nanostructures. Fluorine-doped silica-biochar (SiOx/Cy–Fz) composites produced carbide materials that
illustrated the reduction of nanowires and consequently forming an
uneven fused flat surface, with increasing fluorine dopants. The external
morphological changes were accompanied by decreasing the surface area
from 60.70 to 17.33 m2 g–1 of low to
maximum fluorine loading with progressive constricted pore volume.
Reduction of SiCNW formation could be attributed to the internal structural
defects and disorder on carbon materials of SiC samples during possible
removal of Si from the sp3 Si–C bond via fluorination.
The carbon disorder observed in a F-doped sample may be attributed
to finite or nanoscale graphitic planes or other forms of carbon.
The ID/IG ratio
of F-doped samples decreases with increasing F-dopant, indicating
an increase in the order of microstructures. Characteristic peaks
of β-SiC and fluorine-doped materials depicted in FTIR spectra,
Raman spectra, and XRD patterns corroborate with microstructures and
chemical compositions of pyrolysed products determined by SEM–EDS
and TEM analyses. The successful approach of employing waste byproducts
as unconventional carbon sources for synthesizing silicon carbide
offers an opportunity to further study and understand the reaction
parameters leading to the preferred SiC morphologies.

Methods
Biochar was carbonised in a furnace chamber under N2 at
1000 °C for 60 min and then used as a carbon source. Sol–gel
synthesis of the SiC precursor and its fluorine-doped derivatives,
in SiOx/Cy and SiOx/Cy/Fz forms, proceeded as follows: silane,
water, and organic solvent were mixed in a ratio of 3:1:3 for 4 h
to obtain silica sol. Carbonised biochar and NH4F in a
molar ratio of 1:1 (mass ratio 4.2:9.0) were added successively to
silica sol, homogenized for 2 h, and then left undisturbed to allow
incorporation of silica into biochar. The product was dried in a 60
°C oven for 24 h, designated the SiOx/Cy/Fz (or
F1 (1.00)) as-prepared precursor. NH4F contents were varied
to obtain F-doped derivatives and SiOx/Cy (neat) without NH4F. Precursors
were carbonised in a furnace under an argon atmosphere at 1000 °C
and then reduced at 1400 °C for 1 h. Light greyish to dark gray
products were obtained with decreasing F-content. Characterization
was done using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SM-7600F), transmission
electron microscopy (JEM-2100F), X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku SmartLab),
Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100),
Raman spectrometer (WITech Alpha300 Ar+ laser), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area and pore-size analyzer (Micromeritics TriStar II 3020)
instruments.
