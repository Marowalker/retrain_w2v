In this report, an
expeditious synthesis of two new biologically
active marine natural products serinolamide A and columbamide D is
documented. This convergent approach involves the key steps such as
hydrolytic kinetic resolution, cross metathesis, Grignard reaction,
Johnson–Claisen rearrangement, Mitsunobu, and so forth. Both
of the target molecules were obtained from a common precursor (R)-7 with high enantioselectivity, less synthetic
steps, and in good overall yields (serinolamide A 66% and columbamide
D 62%).

Introduction
The endocannabinoid
system plays a pivotal role in maintaining
various physiological and pathological processes. G-protein coupled
cannabinoid receptor (CB1 and CB2) systems have
been identified as cannabinoid targets. These receptors have significant
implications in various pathophysiologies that include neurodegenerative
diseases, eating disorders, pain, inflammation, and cancer.1 Consequently, the identification of new structural
scaffolds that can bind to the cannabinoid receptors remains an active
research. Fatty acid amides (consists of a fatty acid chain and a
peptide moiety), isolated mainly from marine cyanobacteria, represent
a potential cannabinoid receptor ligands. Among them, serinolamide
A 1, a new marine natural product, was recently isolated
from cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula collected in Papua, New Guinea.2 Serinolamide
A 1 exhibits a moderate agonist effect and selectivity
toward the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. This endocannabinoid
lipid shows excellent structural features with a long chain fatty
acid attached to the serinol derivative, allowing maximum diversity
for the search of more potent candidates. Very recently, two more
chlorinated fatty acid amides such as columbamide D and E have been
isolated from the marine cyanobacterium Moorea bouilloniithat can be structurally related to serinolamide A 1. Importantly, these compounds exhibit moderate cytotoxic activity
against MCF7 breast and H460 lung cancer cells.3 Because of their unique structural features combined with
promising biological profiles of these fatty acid amides, in particular,
serinolamide A 1 and columbamide D 2 have
now became an important target for synthetic chemists (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Selected examples of fatty acid amides from marine cyanobacteria
with binding affinities to cannabinoid receptors.

Very few syntheses of serinolamide A 1 are available
till date. The first synthesis reported was the chiral pool approach
starting from l-serine which comprises more number of steps
and an overall yield of 30%.4 Although
the above-mentioned synthesis was accomplished with a good overall
yield, the number of steps and the use of expensive reagents limit
its use for the large-scale synthesis. For an example, the O-methylation
step of this route requires the usage of excess of expensive silver
oxide with prolonged reaction period. Very recently, a new enantioselective
route for the synthesis of serinolamide A 1 has been
developed employing palladium-catalyzed DYKAT strategy.5 This method appears to be attractive because
of the less number of steps with an overall yield of 51%; however,
this approach requires more protection/deprotection sequences. Similarly,
there is only one report available for the preparation of columbamide
D 2, employing the enantioselective installation of chlorine
atom using MacMillan’s condition as a key step.3a However quite long synthetic steps are required
to accomplish the synthesis of 2 using this strategy.
Therefore, the development of a robust method that can provide facile
access to 1 and 2, especially from a common
intermediate, is highly attractive and desirable. In this context,
as a part of our ongoing program aimed at utilizing terminal epoxides
for the synthesis of various pharmaceutically important compounds,6,7 we herein report an efficient synthetic strategy toward the total
synthesis of serinolamide A 1 and columbamide D 2.

Results and Discussion
A retrosynthetic analysis of 1 and 2 is
based on a convergent approach, as depicted in Scheme 1. It is envisaged that fragment (R)-7 would serve as a common intermediate for
the synthesis of both the target compounds 1 and 2. The key fragment (R)-7 could
be achieved easily from commercially available (R)-benzyl glycidyl ether (R)-3 via epoxide
opening and Mitsunobu protocols. Synthesis of 1 could
be carried out by coupling (R)-7 with
another acid partner 12. Acid fragment 12 can be accessed from alcohol 8 through oxidation, Grignard
reaction, and Johnson–Claisen rearrangement.8 Similarly, target 2 could be achieved by coupling
between the two fragments that is alcohol (R)-7 and acid 21. Compound 21, in turn,
could be obtained from olefin 13 via Appel reaction,
cross-metathesis, hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR), and so forth,
as key steps.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis of 1 and 2
Accordingly, we first
chose to prepare the key component (R)-7, which is a common precursor for both
serinolamide A 1 and columbamide D 2 (Scheme 2). Commercially available
(R)-benzyl glycidyl ether (R)-3 was regioselectively opened using methanol under basic conditions
to get the protected triol (R)-4. Here,
it is worth mentioning that this step of O-methylation is simple and
straightforward as compared to the reported cumbersome protocol that
involves the excess use of expensive silver oxide for O-methylation.4 Now, the compound (R)-4 on treatment with N-methyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonamide
employing Mitsunobu protocol afforded the amino alcohol (S)-5. Nosyl deprotection using thiophenol followed by
hydrogenolysis afforded the key fragment (R)-7.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Amino Alcohol Fragment (R)-7
With the enantiopure amino alcohol (R)-7 in hand, we diverted our attention toward the synthesis
of fragment 12 that is required for the final coupling
reaction to obtain
serinolamide A 1 (Scheme 3). Thus, the commercially available tetradecanol 8 was first oxidized to get the corresponding aldehyde 9, which on Grignard reaction with vinyl magnesium chloride
afforded allyl alcohol 10. Next, the intermediate 10 was heated with triethyl orthoacetate in a sealed tube
to furnish ester 11, followed by hydrolysis to accomplish
the synthesis of the required acid fragment 12.

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of Fragment 12
Similarly, fragment 21 required for the preparation
of columbamide D 2 was prepared in seven linear steps
starting from 9-decen-1-ol 13 (Scheme 4). O-protection of compound 13 followed by epoxidation using m-CPBA afforded epoxide 15. Obviously, the best option to induce chirality in terminal
epoxide is the choice of the HKR strategy.9 Therefore, the racemic epoxide was treated with Jacobsen’s
catalyst [(S,S)-salen Co(III)-OAc]
in the presence of H2O to yield the required chiral epoxide 16a and diol 16b as a byproduct. Importantly,
the undesired diol 16b can be converted into the desired
epoxide 16a as per the reported procedure.10 Epoxide 16a underwent regioselective
ring opening smoothly with pent-4-en-1-yl magnesium bromide, followed
by silyl deprotection to afford diol 18. Installation
of chlorine atoms on C-7 and C-15 was achieved using Appel reaction
and subsequent chain elongation, employing a cross-metathesis reaction
between 19 and acid 20, furnishing the required
fragment 21. It is important to mention here that we
accomplished the synthesis of fragment 21 in simple 7
steps as compared to the lengthy 17 steps reported in the literature.3a

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Fragment 21
After successful preparation
of all of the required fragments,
finally, we coupled the common precursor (R)-7 with component 12 using EDC/HOBt to accomplish
the synthesis of serinolamide A 1 (Scheme 5). Similarly, (R)-7 was coupled with fragment 21 using the same
reaction condition to furnish columbamide D 2. The structures
were confirmed by its 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis. The enantiomeric purity of 1 was determined by chiral HPLC analysis (see the Supporting Information).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of 1 and 2
Conclusions
In summary, we accomplished the total synthesis
of two new naturally
occurring fatty acid amides, that is, serinolamide A 1 and columbamide D 2, in less number of steps and good
overall yields. Further, both of these target compounds are obtained
from a common precursor (R)-7 in high
optical purity. In addition, the acid fragment 21 was
synthesized in 7 steps in good yield as compared to the reported 17
steps. We envisage that this simple protocol may find application
for the large-scale synthesis of 1 and 2, and the strategy could be exploited further for the preparation
of newer analogues of 1 and 2 that can be
utilized for extensive biological studies.

Experimental Section
General
Information
Unless otherwise specified, all
reactions were carried out in oven-dried vials or reaction vessels
with magnetic stirring under argon atmosphere. Dried solvents and
liquid reagents were transferred by oven-dried syringes or hypodermic
syringe cooled to ambient temperature in desiccators. All experiments
were monitored by analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC). TLC
was performed on precoated silica gel plates. After elution, plate
was visualized under UV illumination at 254 nm for UV active materials.
Further visualization was achieved by staining anisaldehyde and charring
on a hot plate. Solvents were removed in vacuo and heated with a water
bath at 35 °C. Silica gel finer than 200 mesh was used for flash
column chromatography. Columns were packed as a slurry of silica gel
in pet. ether and equilibrated with the appropriate solvent mixture
prior to use. The compounds were loaded neatly
or used as a concentrated solution using the appropriate solvent system.

Melting points are uncorrected and recorded using digital BUCHI
Melting Point Apparatus B-540. 1H NMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV, 400/500 MHz spectrometers
in appropriate solvents using TMS as the internal standard or solvent
signals as secondary standards, and the chemical shifts are shown
in δ scales. Multiplicities of 1H NMR signals are
designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), dt
(doublet of triplet), t (triplet), quin (quintet), m (multiplet),
and so forth. Optical rotations were measured using a JASCO P 1020
digital polarimeter. HRMS was performed on a TOF/Q-TOF mass spectrometer.
