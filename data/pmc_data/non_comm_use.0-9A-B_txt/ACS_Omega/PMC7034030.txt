Coordination compounds formed by
flavonoid ligands are recognized
as promising candidates as novel drugs with enhanced antioxidant and
anticancer activity. Zn(II)–Rutin complexes have been described
in the literature and distinct coordination modes proposed based on 1H NMR/MS and IR/UV–VIS experimental spectroscopic data:
1:1/1:2 (Zn(II) binding to A-C rings) and 2:1 (Zn(II) binding to A-C-B
rings) stoichiometry. Aiming to clarify these experimental findings
and provide some physical insights into the process of complex formation
in solution, we carried out density functional theory calculations
of NMR and UV–VIS spectra for 25 plausible Zn(II)–Rutin
molecular structures including solvent effect using the polarizable
continuum model approach. The studied complexes in this work have
1:1, 1:2, 2:1, and 3:1 metal–ligand stoichiometry for all relevant
Zn(II)–Rutin configurations. The least deviation between theoretical
and experimental spectroscopic data was used as an initial criterion
to select the probable candidate structures. Our theoretical spectroscopic
results strongly indicate that the experimentally suggested modes
of coordination (1:2 and 2:1) are likely to exist in solution, supporting
the two distinct experimental findings in DMSO and methanol solution,
which may be seen as an interesting result. Our predicted 1:2 and
2:1 metal complexes are in agreement with the experimental stoichiometry;
however, they differ from the proposed structure. Besides the prediction
of the coordination site and molecular structure in solution, an important
contribution of this work is the determination of the OH–C5
deprotonation state of rutin due to metal complexation at the experimental
conditions (pH = 6.7 and 7.20). We found that, in the two independent
synthesis of metal complexes, distinct forms of rutin (OH–C5
and O(−)–C5) are present, which are rather
difficult to be assessed experimentally.

Introduction
Flavonoids belong to
a broad subclass of natural polyphenols with
relatively low molar mass, which are present in plants such as Camellia sinensis (popularly known as green tea),
fruits like Euterpe oleracea (acai
berry, typical fruit from Brazil), and plants seed such as Glycine max (soy). They consist of a large group
of polyphenolic compounds that have a benzopyrone base structure,
and their activities are dependent on structural aspects. Compounds
derived from natural flavonoids are widely known for their antibacterial,
antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory biological activities.1−3 Although it is proven that most of the biological properties of
these polyphenols are associated with its high antioxidant potential,4,5 they have shown to be promising anticancer agents.6,7 The chemical nature of flavonoids depends on their class, hydroxylation
and polymerization degrees, chemical substitutions, and conjugations.8 A relationship between the molecular structure
and biological activity is always a welcome piece of information;
in this sense, structural characterization studies of polyphenols
have been conducted, mainly through X-ray data analysis in the solid
state.9 From a theoretical side, a recent
review has been reported addressing the reliability of density functional
theory (DFT)10 for the prediction of the
main antioxidant properties, encompassing phenolic natural antioxidants,
and reaction mechanisms involving free radicals.11

The base nucleus of the flavonoids (the benzopyrone
group) may
present several functional groups that give rise to the classes of
flavonoids, making this family of compounds one of the most studied
in the area of natural products. Rutin (Scheme 1), belonging to the flavonols class, possesses
a total of 10 hydroxyl groups, with two attached to the A ring (positions
5 and 7), two at the B ring (positions 3′ and 4′), and
six distributed on the glucopyranosyl (labeled G, positions 2″,
3″, and 4″) and rhamnopyranosyl (labeled R, positions
2″′, 3″′, and 4″′) units.
The relevant rutin torsion angles (ϕi) are also shown
in Scheme 1, where
the high conformational flexibility of the molecule can be promptly
seen. Therefore, the rutin molecule has a high capacity of coordination
to metal ions through available oxygen atoms, including the carbonyl
group at the C4 position of ring C. There are various reports on the
synthesis and characterization of metal–Rutin complexes as,
for example, Zn(II),12 Sn(II),13 Al(III),14 Cu(II),15 Fe(II),16 and other
metal ions, with coordination compounds exhibiting various ligand–metal
stoichiometries (1:1, 1:2, and 2:1) and spatial conformations being
predicted. According to
Ikeda et al.,12 the formation of coordination
compounds with rutin greatly increases the antioxidant power and,
consequently, other properties (especially antitumor activity). The
authors showed that the Zn(II)–Rutin complexes have significantly
higher antioxidant activity than free rutin, no toxicity against normal
cells of the rat organ, and potential cytotoxicity against the cancer
cells.

Definition
Various experimental studies
addressing the metal complex formation
with flavonoid ligands in solution and highlighting the enhancement
of biological activity compared with free flavonoids have been reported
over the past years (see, for example, refs (17−21)). A recent review on the properties and applications of metal–flavonoid
complexes can be found in ref (22). The improvement of the drug efficacy due to complex formation
is a well-known fact, and an understanding of this experimental result
at a molecular level is certainly of relevance and gives a great motivation
for the use of computational chemistry methods to investigate these
molecular systems. The utility of theoretical calculations of metal–flavonoid
complexes to assist experimental investigations is evident from various
DFT studies reported on computation of molecular structures, relative
energies, and spectroscopic quantities that can be compared with experimental
data (see, for example, refs (23−27)).

Two independent synthesis of Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes have
been reported in the literature12,28 and conducted in DMSO
and methanol solution using ZnCl2 and [Zn(CH3COO)2]·2H2O as reactants, respectively.
In ref (28), the preparation
of the sample for NMR experiment studies were conducted on 5 mM solutions
of flavonoids in mixture solvents of DMSO/Tris-HCl (pH 7.20). The
solutions were titrated with increasing concentration of zinc chloride
(1/4, 1/2, 1, and 2 equiv of Zn(II) ions). Through the analysis of 1H NMR and MS spectra in DMSO-d6/D2O, two possible complex structures were proposed in
ref (28), with the
hydroxy group at the C5 position of A ring deprotonated and Zn(II)
binding at O(−)–C5 and O=C4 positions
to form 1:1 and 1:2 metal:ligand complexes. The assignment of the
two structures was based on the analysis of MS data in DMSO, which
produced two peaks with m/z ratio
equivalent to 1:1 and 1:2 forms of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes.
No other site of ligand coordination was considered in ref (28).

In ref (12), a solution
of [Zn(CH3COO)2]·2H2O salt in
distilled water was slowly added dropwise to a solution of dehydrated
rutin (Dimorphandra mollis) in methanol.
The mixture was stirred at 90–140 rpm for 24 h at 37–40
°C. The complex was filtered in a vacuum system, washed with
methanol, and dried at room temperature. The complex characterization
was made analyzing IR (solid-state sample), UV–VIS (in methanol
solution), and 1H NMR (in DMSO-d6 solution) spectroscopic data. Through the analysis of spectroscopic
data, the authors proposed the formation of a 2:1 complex with the
first Zn(II) ion binding at C5–OH (not deprotonated) and O=C4
positions, and the second metal ion binding at (−)O–C3′ and (−)O–C4′
(both hydroxyl groups deprotonated). Two water molecules completed
the coordination sphere of the first Zn(II) ion (tetracoordinated)
and four water molecules in the second Zn(II) ion (hexacoordinated).
An important result reported in ref (12) is the enhanced biological activity of the synthesized
Zn(II)–Rutin complexes compared with free rutin. Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes has not shown any cytotoxicity against normal cells or toxicity
in BALB/c mice but has shown antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity
against cancer cell lines in vitro and synergistic antitumor activity
preventing side effects of chemotherapy.

We found these dissimilar
experimental assignments of the preferred
complex molecular structures in solution12,28 very interesting and intriguing. We thought that it would be relevant
to investigate this complex at a molecular level using quantum chemical
methods since experimental data are reported for macroscopic samples
in solution and no direct access to the molecular structure or conformation
of the metal–flavonoid complex is available to the experimentalists.
The only experimental source of information is the spectroscopic data,
and according to the analysis of experimental data, it seems that
distinct modes of complexation are present in the two reported preparations12,28 of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes in DMSO and methanol solution using
different zinc ion reactants.

The understanding of biological
activity involves the knowledge
of metal–flavonoid complex structure and binding sites. Therefore,
the use of quantum chemical calculations of molecular properties combined
with available experimental spectroscopic data can be of great help
for the determination of the molecular structure in solution (which
is hard to be attained experimentally). Theoretical results may contribute
to the investigation of the mechanism of action at a molecular level
that involves the study of interaction of metal–flavonoid complexes
with specific target sites in a biological environment. In this article,
we investigated the molecular structure of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes
in solution through DFT calculations of spectroscopic properties (1H NMR, UV–VIS, and IR). From comparison of theoretical
results with experimental spectroscopic data obtained, the most probable
structures of Zn(II) complexes with rutin ligand in solution was obtained.
Our results strongly suggest that metal complexes having a distinct
metal:ligand stoichiometry (1:2 and 2:1) can be present in the two
experimental preparations reported recently12,28 for the metal complex.

Results and Discussion

considered in this work, with a total of 25 Zn(II)–Rutin complex
structures optimized, encompassing mono-, bi-, and tri-OH deprotonated
structures besides the neutral rutin (fully protonated) as shown in Figure 1. All Zn(II)–Rutin
optimized complex structures investigated in this work are shown in Figure 2.

Experimental 1H NMR chemical shift (in
DMSO-d6/D2O solution) was reported
for
Zn(II)–Rutin complexes,28 which
are used as a reference for the determination of plausible candidate
complex structures based on the comparison with DFT-PCM calculated
NMR spectra in DMSO. As reported previously,38 in a comprehensive conformational analysis of flavonoid rutin, rotation
of ϕ1 and ϕ2 torsion angles is required
to reach an agreement with 1H NMR data in DMSO solution
for H2′, H5′, and H6′ B-ring protons of free
rutin. The best dihedral angle values are38 ϕ1 = −150° and ϕ2 =
130° with the fully optimized torsion angles being 175°
(close to planarity) and 119°, respectively. These torsion angle
values were used as a guide for the rotation of the B ring in the
metal complex structures. Figure 3a shows deviation between B3LYP-PCM-DMSO and experimental
(in DMSO-d6)281H NMR chemical shift, and Figure 3b gives the RMSD values for selected Zn(II)–Rutin
complex structures. The best fit with experimental data is highlighted
in rectangle in Figure 3 where it can be seen that the RMSD value for complex 3 is only 0.085. Corresponding MAE, slope standard error, and Adj. R-squared deviation values for all 25 metal complex structures
are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1) as well as 1H NMR spectra for representative
complex structures showing reasonable agreement with experimental
NMR data (Figure S2).

Figure 4 shows experimental 1H NMR spectra28 measured in DMSO-d6 and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)-PCM-DMSO 1H NMR spectra for selected Zn2+–Rutin ϕ1/ϕ2 rotated complex structures. Complexes 17, 20, and 25 are included to assess
the effect of deprotonation at OH–C5 on the NMR profile. It
is worth mentioning that B3LYP 1H NMR spectra for free
rutin and complex 2 structures optimized in DMSO (PCM)
are given in Figures S3 and S4 (Supporting
Information) just to show the effect of inclusion of solvent effect
on geometry optimization (DFT-PCM). It can be seen that there is no
significant change on the molecular structure, with the new 1H NMR spectra (PCM optimized geometries) being virtually identical
to the spectra calculated with geometries optimized in the gas phase,
and so, no geometry optimization in DMSO (PCM) is required. The best
match between experimental and theoretical 1H NMR profiles
can be used as a criterion to select the candidate structure to be
present in DMSO solution. It should be said that all magnetic tensors
were scaled to reproduce the H5′ proton (as has been done previously
for rutin38) only to facilitate comparison
with experimental NMR pattern (this is just a translation of the theoretical
spectrum without changing the relative position of each proton signal).
This procedure has been adopted in previous works.27,36−38,40,41

It can be seen from Figure 4 that complex 3 (1:2) exhibits the best agreement
with the experimental NMR profile and the lowest statistics indices
according to the results reported in Figure 3 followed by complex 1 (1:1)
and 24 (3:1), which also show a reasonable deviation
from experimental NMR data. Based on the analysis of experimental
NMR and mass spectra data reported in ref (28), the authors proposed two structures as candidates
to be present in DMSO solution (Figure 2b,d): complex 2 (1:1) and 4 (1:2), which are equivalent to the structures 1 and 3 but deprotonated at HO–C5 (see Figure 2). The mass spectra revealed two major fragments
species at m/z 673.2 and 1283.6
assigned to 1:1 complex denominated [Zn(L–H)]+ and 1:2 complex [Zn(L–H)2+H]+, respectively, with another possibility of 1:1
complex being [Zn(Rut)(X)2] (X = H2O or Cl–). The fragment species assigned in the mass spectra
could also be obtained considering complexes 1 (1:1)
and 3 (1:2) calculated in this work; therefore, they
cannot be ruled out based only on the analysis of the mass spectra.
However, the mass spectra data eliminate the possibility of the existence
of 2:1 (structures 15–23) and 3:1
(structures 24 and 25) complexes in the
experimental preparation of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes in DMSO
solution reported in ref (28).

Analysis of Figure 4 reveals that complexes 2 and 4 have practically
the same 1H NMR spectrum, showing large discrepancy for
the H6 and H8 proton signals, which are predicted almost degenerate
for these structures. The experimental H6 and H8 chemical shift values
are 6.23 and 6.45 ppm, respectively, with the values for complex 2 being 5.92 and 5.97 ppm (5.88 and 5.93 for complex 4) showing a relatively large deviation from the experiment
of −0.31 and – 0.48 (−0.35 and – 0.52
for complex 4), respectively. This mode of Zn(II) coordination
shifts the H6,H8 NMR signals away from the experimental pattern. In
addition, the separation between H6 and H-1G protons signals is 1.13
ppm in the experimental spectrum, while that for complexes 2 and 4 is 0.6 ppm and precisely 1.1 ppm for complex 3, again in agreement with the experiment. It can be seen
from Figure 4 that
complex 3 NMR patterns show an overall best match with
the experimental 1H NMR profile, strongly indicating that
this is the complex structures present in DMSO solution (only H8 proton
is preventing an almost exact match for complex 3 by
ca. 0.2 ppm).

The deprotonation of OH–C5 at the A ring,
proposed in ref (28), has a measurable effect
on H8 and H6 protons signals, shifting to a high field region, which
can be explained with the use of valence-bond theory, which reveals
resonance hybrids with a negative charge distributed over C6 and C8
carbons (Scheme 2),
justifying the bigger shielding in their hydrogen atoms (and the same
behavior is observed for OH–C5 deprotonated free rutin, showed
in Figure S3d,e). The calculated H6 and
H8 1H NMR profiles for complexes 2 and 4 strongly indicate that they are not likely to be present
in the experiment reported in DMSO solution.28

Scheme 2 Resonance Scheme Showing the Bigger H6 and H8 Shielding
At this point, it is pertinent to establish
how much the theoretical
NMR pattern deviation from the experimental profile must be to safely
discard a given Zn(II)–Rutin complex structure. According to
the results reported in Figure 3, it can be seen that complexes 1 and 24 exhibit relatively small deviation from experimental data, with
the difference from the RMSD values calculated for complex 1 being 0.044 and 0.035 ppm, respectively, which are within the DFT
precision for the calculation of 1H NMR chemical shifts.
Therefore, complexes 1 and 24 may not be
totally discarded based only on the analysis of 1H NMR
data. All theoretical–experimental deviation data reported
in Figure 3 pointed
out to complex 3 as the predominant structure in DMSO
solution, with complexes 1 and 24 coming
next. In spite of that, the molecular mass of complexes 24 (908.0 amu) is incompatible with the data from the mass spectrum
regarding the fragments of m/z 673.2
and 1283.6 reported in ref (28). It should be mentioned that, in ref (28), the proposal of complexes 2 and 4 was based on the analysis of MS spectra
and the possibility of the protonated OH–C5 site was not considered.
These structures are equivalent to 1 and 3, respectively, with the only difference being the deprotonation
at OH–C5. Our calculated NMR results provide strong evidence
that complex 3 (and also complex 1 within
a given uncertainty range) should be present in the NMR experiment
conducted in DMSO solution, not complexes 2 and 4 as proposed in ref (28).

In another experiment reported12 for
the preparation of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes, a solution of [Zn(CH3COO)2]·2H2O salt in distilled water
was slowly added dropwise to a solution of dehydrated rutin in methanol.
The experimental complex characterization was done through IR and
UV–VIS analysis, and a 2:1 complex involving the OC4–OC5
(site 1) and O(−)C3′–O(−)C4′ (site 2) modes of complexation was proposed (complex 20 from Figure 2t). We have investigated various possibilities for 2:1 Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes (and also 3:1 mode of complexation) with the DFT optimized
structures given in Figure 2 (structures 15–25). Figure 5 shows B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)-PCM-Methanol
Band-I and Band-II UV–VIS shifts due to complex formation (in
nm) for these structures as well as 1:1 and 1:2 complexes. UV–VIS
excitation energies (in nm) for selected metal–flavonoid complex
structures are given in Table 1.

d Experimental data from ref (12).

It can be seen
from Figure 5 that
the best fit with the experimental UV–VIS profile
reported in ref (12) was attained by the 2:1 complex 17 (site 1 (O(−)C5–OC4) and site 2 (OC3′–O(−)C4′)) followed closely by the 3:1 complex 25.
The structure 17 is the similar to the one proposed experimentally
in ref (12) but deprotonated
at the O5 moiety. It can be seen from Figure 5 that the complex structure proposed in ref (12), structure 20, shows a poor agreement with experimental UV–VIS data (Band
I)12 and can be ruled out from the second
experimental work12 (the same holds for
structure 18, which is similar but with Zn tetracoordinated).
It should be mentioned that our DFT results corroborate the experimentally
proposed complex stoichiometry (2:1) and also provide valuable information
on OH deprotonations at the A ring and B ring of rutin, which is not
easily attained by experimentalists since it is sensitive to the experimental
conditions.

It can be promptly seen from Figure 5 that, apart from complexes 17 and 25, highlighted in rectangle, the other complexes
can be eliminated
as candidate structures based on UV–VIS analysis. UV–VIS
shift data for all 25 complex structures, along with simulated UV–VIS
spectra, are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S5 and S6) where it can be confirmed that only structures 17 and 25 show agreement with experimental data.12 It can be seen that, while the experimentally
proposed12 complex 20, where
Zn(II) ions are tetracoordinated (site 1) and hexacoordinated (site
2) with rutin deprotonated at O(−)H3′ and
O(−)H4′ positions (site 2), has very poor
agreement with experimental UV–VIS data (Band-I), complex 17, a similar structure with rutin deprotonated at O(−)H5 (site 1) and O(−)H4′ (site 2) positions
and Zn(II) ions tetracoordinated, shows nice agreement with experimental
UV–VIS data. The same good agreement with experimental band
shifts due to complexation is found for complex 25 (also
having OH–C5 deprotonated). It is also worth noting that the
number of water molecules coordinated to Zn at site 2 does not change
the UV spectral profile as shown for structures 7 (two
water molecules) and 8 (four water molecules) (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

Analyzing
the IR data from ref (12), the C=O stretching shift of −28
cm–1 due to complexation can be used to rule out
all 1:1 complexes with the Zn(II) metal ion not coordinated to site
1. Thus, the complexes 6, 13, and 14 (and also 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12) were ruled
out because a small positive shift is predicted, which is not in agreement
with experimental data (Table 1). The OH band is broad and does not bring useful information.
We focused on the UV–VIS data, which seems more relevant for
structural analysis than the IR spectra.

In summary, our theoretical
spectroscopic results combined with
corresponding experimental data from refs (12, 28) lead us to affirm that there is a great
possibility that distinct modes of complexation are operating in these

B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/Lanl2DZ metal–ligand bond distance and
bond angles for 16 representative complex structures (Figure 2) are given in Table S2 along with the definition of geometrical
parameters (Scheme 3), with results
for four selected structures shown in Figure 6 given in Table 2. The Zn–O distances range from 1.9
to 2.1 Å for the tetracoordinated metal center, with the Zn–O(−) distance being shorter than the Zn–OH one
as expected. For hexacoordinated Zn(II) (Cpx-20, see Table S2), the distances are larger (2.0–2.3
Å). In addition, the O–Zn–O bond angles involving
the oxygen atoms from rutin (around 90°–100°) are
smaller than the corresponding angles involving the water molecules
coordinated to the metal. The geometries are distorted from the ideal
tetrahedral form (and also octahedral for complex 20)
with the coordinated water molecules occupying spatial positions in
order to minimize the interaction energy without preserving symmetry.

Calculated energy of complex
formation (ΔEf) is often considered
as a useful quantity to assess
its plausibility as observed molecular structure. In order to propose
a model reaction for the formation of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes,
the experimental conditions of complex synthesis must be known. Following
the protocol from ref (28) for the preparation Zn(II)–Rutin complex in DMSO solution,
zinc chloride and rutin (Rut) were used as reactants. Equations 1–3 are examples of the model reaction of formation for various complexes,
where n, m, and k are integer numbers chosen to fit the reaction stoichiometry. Three
possibilities for ZnCl2 solution were considered: only
[Zn(H2O)6]2+ (eq 1), hydrated zinc and chlorine species (eq 2), and nonhydrated free
Zn(II) and Cl– species (eq 3). The protocol from ref (12) employing [Zn(CH3COO)2]·2H2O as a reactant was also used
(eq 4). In addition,
binding energy calculations employing eq 5 from ref (25), used in the DFT study of Zn(II) coordination by quercetin
and luteolin leading to the determination of the preferred chelation
site, were also done, which is rather different from eqs 1–4. In eq 5, the change
in the flavonoid structure due to the removal of hydrogen atoms from
OH groups where the zinc atom was bound (deprotonation) was accomplished
using H2O as a relevant chemical potential for the abstraction
of H atoms. In eq 5, Etotal is the total energy of the complex, EX and nX are the
energy and number of species X involved in the complexation reaction
(X = Zn, Rut, H), and nH is the number
of hydrogen atoms missing from the neutral rutin molecule after complexation,
with the abstracted H atoms becoming part of a H2O molecule.25 Complexes solvated by H2O or chlorine
molecules are calculated adding the appropriate species in eq 5. 1   2   3   4   5  where n =
1,2,3; m = 1,2 ; k = 2,4,6; and p = 0,1,2,3,4 (depends on nH, the ligand deprotonation degree).

For the calculation of
Zn(II)–Rutin interaction energy,
we used the M06-2x43 DFT functional with
a triple-zeta quality 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set.32 M06-2x43 is a highly parameterized
approximate exchange-correlation energy functional based on the meta-GGA
approximation developed by the Truhlar’s group. There are various
reports in the literature supporting the use of the M06-2x functional
in quantum chemical calculations of molecular systems. An example
is the study of a corannulene–cisplatin model complex where
the B3LYP interaction energy was shown to be considerably underestimated
compared to post-Hartree–Fock MP244 result, while the M06-2x functional showed fine agreement45 and so was recommended for the description of
the intermolecular interaction in the cisplatin–nanohorn system45 and also cisplatin–carbon nanotube inclusion
and adsorbed complexes.46 Therefore, this
seems appropriate for the calculation of Zn(II)–Rutin interaction
energy.

M06-2x/6-311+G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)/Lanl2DZ energy
of Zn(II)–Rutin
complex formation (ΔE) and Gibbs free energy
(ΔG), both in the gas phase, using eqs 1–4 named Model-1, Model-2 , Model-3, and Model-4 reactions,
respectively, are given in Figure 7a, along with binding energies calculated using eq 5. Corresponding ΔG values in DMSO, water, and methanol solvents (M06-2x-PCM
results) are reported in Figure 7b–d. The double slash means that geometries
were optimized at the B3LYP level and energies were calculated using
the M06-2x functional. As we might have expected, the chosen model
reaction of complex formation can influence significantly the calculated
complex stabilization energy (Figure 7a) and may not be very helpful to assign the most probable
complex structure. However, looking at the energy profiles shown in Figure 7a, it can be seen
that the vacuum and gas phase profiles of model-3 of formation reaction
matches very well the corresponding pattern using eq 5 from ref (25), with complex 25 predicted as the most favorable followed by 24, 20, and 19. Therefore, it seems reasonable to
use the model-3 reaction to analyze our results. Model-3 reactions
of complex formation equations for representative complex structures
are given in Scheme 4.

Scheme 4 Model-3 Reaction Equations for Complex Formation Energies Shown in Figure 7 (highlighted)
Figure 7b–d
shows us that complex 17 (2:1) is the preferred one in
solution according to model-3 reactions (highlighted) followed by
complexes 6 and 14, with ΔG values relative to complex 17 being 16.5
and 18.1 kcal mol–1 (DMSO), 13.3 and 15.3 kcal mol–1 (water), and 17.9 and 19.3 kcal mol–1 (methanol), respectively. Complex 17 is also a good
candidate structure based on comparison of theoretical and experimental
UV–VIS data (in methanol) reported in ref (12) (Figure 5). However, complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4, which were considered
candidate structures according to the analysis of 1H NMR
spectra in DMSO, have very low energy of formation compared to the
lowest energy complex, with values relative to complex 17, being 65.9, 51.7, 68.1, and 50.1 kcal mol–1,
respectively, and so may be discarded from a thermodynamic analysis
of reaction of complex formation. Based only on energetic grounds,
complex 17 should be predominant in solution (DMSO, water,
and methanol solvents), which is in agreement with the analysis of
UV–VIS spectra (Figure 5). However, according to comparison between theoretical and
experimental 1H NMR data obtained in DMSO solution from
ref (28), it can be
ruled out from that first experimental preparation of Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes since it exhibits much large deviation from the experimental
NMR profile (see Figure 3) and also a wrong NMR profile regarding H6, H8, and H1G protons
(see Figure 4).

An important point to be addressed is the solubility of flavonoids
in a polar solvent, such as water, which is present in biological
media, that is fundamental for efficient use as an anticancer and
antioxidant agent. It has been reported in various experimental works
that complexation with transition metal ions enhances considerably
the biological activity of flavonoids, and our results corroborate
to the role played by solvent effects on the increasing activity of
these polyphenol compounds. Solubility (mole fraction × 106) of free rutin in various solvents taken from ref (42) and negative solvation
energy (M06-2x/6-311+G(2d,p)) PCM value in kcal mol–1) for representative Zn(II)–Rutin complexes in three solvents
(DMSO, water, and methanol) at room temperature are shown in Figure 8a. It can be seen
from Figure 8a that
there is a rough correlation between solubility and DFT-calculated
solvation energy, with the lowest solubility found in water solution.
The discrepancy between experimental and solvation energy trend for
ethanol and 1-butanol can be seen in the light of the PCM model used
to describe solvent effects, which does not include explicit solute–solvent
interaction that certainly is relevant for the prediction of solubility
in polar solvents. Nevertheless, our results provide evidence that
DFT solvation energies can be used as an estimate of the solubility
tendency of a series of structural related chemical compounds.

(mole fraction × 106) (experimental
data taken from ref (42)) and negative solvation energy (M06-2x/6-311+G(2d,p) PCM value in

temperature. (b) Negative of PCM (DMSO, water, and methanol solvents)
solvation energy (in kcal mol–1) for relevant Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes (structures: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, and 25) and free rutin. The B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) optimized geometries (ϕ1/ϕ2 rotated structures) and M062x functional
with 6-31G(d,p) and 6-311+G(2d,p) basis sets were used. A large positive
value of calculated solvation energy is associated with high solubility.

The DFT solvation energy results (negative values
are used to easy
to make connection with solubility) reported in Figure 8b reveal that metal complexation indeed improves
solubility, except for complex 4 where complexation with
Zn(II) did not cause a positive effect. This fact indicates that complex 4 may not be effective in biological applications as well
as complexes 2. As expected, charged species have larger
solvation energies in polar solvents, which is reflected by the high
solvation energy values of complexes 1 (charge = 2+), 3 (charge = 2+), and 17 (charge = 2+) and also
much larger values for complexes 15 (charge = 4+), 16 (charge = 3+), 22 (charge = 3+), 24 (charge = 4+), and 25 (charge = 3+). Therefore, these
structures may be considered good candidates as the Zn(II)–Rutin
molecular structure responsible for the enhanced biological activity
compared to the free rutin reported in the experimental work12 based on solvation energy analysis. The solubility
of rutin in polar solvents can be enhanced enormously through complexation
with metal ions as shown in Figure 8b, with charged complexes being substantially stabilized
by the solvent effect. It can be inferred from Figure 8b that the active form of the drug may not
be complex 4, as proposed in ref (28), due to too low solubility
in aqueous media. As it could be expected, the protonated rutin (Rut–OH)
is moderately destabilized in DMSO solution (and also water), which
corroborates to the lower solubility in water observed experimentally,
with the opposite happened with the OH–C5 deprotonated form
of rutin (Rut–O–), which is substantially
stabilized in DMSO, water, and methanol solution (solvation energy
values of −36.8, −33.9, and – 46.9 kcal mol–1, respectively). 1H NMR spectra analysis
indicates that the deprotonated rutin species is not present in the
experimental DMSO sample of free rutin and consequently in water solution
(see Supporting Information, Figure S2)
unless basic conditions are satisfied, which is also not the case
of biological media. Therefore, the formation of the Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes with deprotonated species in neutral pH aqueous solution
should be viewed with caution, and determination of a mechanism of
deprotonation is required. Our theoretical 1H NMR results
for complex 3 [Zn(Rut)2OH]+, having
the rutin molecule protonated at the OH–C5 position, are in
agreement with this common sense argument. For the existence of complexes 2 and 4, there must be a viable mechanism for
deprotonation of Rut–OH to allow complexation with Zn(II).
Basic media could be a possibility; however, this condition is not
met at biological media where the pH is close to 7, not favoring OH
deprotonation.

An experimental and theoretical study of deprotonation
mechanism
and acidity constants in aqueous solution of flavonols was published
recently.47 pKa data for quercetin was reported and may be useful to analyze our
theoretical results since quercetin has A, B, and C ring protons similar
to rutin, with the only difference being a hydroxyl group at the O–C3
position of ring C replacing the glucopyranosyl and rhamnopyranosyl
units of rutin. According to the results (ΔG of deprotonation) reported in ref (47), the order of deprotonation sites of quercetin
in aqueous solution is as follows: OH–C4′ (pKa = 6.59), OH–C7 (pKa = 8.60), OH–C3 (pKa = 14.40) (which is replaced by sugar groups in rutin), OH–C3′
(pKa = 19.11), and OH–C5 (pKa = 20.91), values obtained at 298.15 K from
the standard equation that defines the thermodynamic equilibrium constant
(ΔG = – RTlnKa).

The deprotonation position (OH–C5)
assumed in ref (28) to propose the existence
of complexes 2 and 4 is the least favorable
deprotonation hydroxyl group of quercetin, which should also hold
for rutin. Regarding the OH protons situated at the sugar moieties,
a variable pH NMR spectroscopic study48 reported for β-cyclodextrin in alkaline aqueous solution revealed
that it does not deprotonate at pH < 12.0, with pKa values for OH groups adjacent to C-2 and C-3 carbon
atoms being 13.5 ± 0.02 (22.5 °C). We can use the results
from ref (48) as an
estimate of pKa values for sugar OH protons
of rutin, which is not so far away from the second pKa value determined for quercetin. These reported pKa values provide support (except for deprotonations
in the glycidic region) for our predicted Zn(II)–Rutin complexes
structures based on spectroscopic analysis, having deprotonation at
the OH–C4′ position and not at the OH–C5 site
(proposed in ref (28)). However, our good agreement with experimental UV–VIS data
in methanol solution for complexes 17 and 25 (deprotonated at the OH–C5 position) makes us believe that
the Zn(II) ion play an important role on the whole process somehow
activating deprotonation at the OH–C5 of free rutin, which
would not happen in the absence of the metal ion.

Conclusions
In this work, we reported DFT calculations of energy of formation
and spectroscopic properties (1H NMR, IR, and UV–VIS
data) in DMSO, methanol, and water solution using the PCM model to
describe solvent effects for 25 plausible structures of Zn(II)–Rutin
complexes, which showed enhanced biological activity as compared to
the free rutin molecule. There are two independent experimental preparations
of the rutin complex with zinc ion, and distinct molecular structures
were proposed, 1:2 (and also 1:1) and 2:1 model of complexation, based
on the analysis of 1H NMR (and mass spectra data in DMSO
solution) and UV–VIS data (in methanol), respectively.

Comparison of our calculated DFT spectroscopic results in solution
with experimental data revealed that different metal complex structures
are likely to be present in the two Zn(II)–Rutin synthesis
conducted in DMSO28 (complex 3, [Zn(Rut)2]2+, 1:2) and methanol solution12 (complex 17, [Zn2(H2O)4RutO4′O5]3+, 2:1).
The complex structure having the best agreement with experimental
UV–VIS data from ref (12) (structure 17) is not the same as the one
showing the best accordance with experimental 1H NMR data
from ref (28) (structure 3). In addition, we showed that deprotonation at the OH–C5
position of rutin in DMSO solution, as proposed in ref (28), should be viewed with
care on the basis of experimental deprotonation studies for other
flavonoids and also theoretical 1H NMR results. Our predicted
complex structure in methanol solution based on comparison of theoretical
and experimental UV–VIS data, complex 17 deprotonated
at the OH–C5 position, lead us to think that the metal ion
should play an important role, somehow inducing deprotonation at the
OH–C5 position of free rutin. We showed in this work that it
does not take place in the absence of the Zn(II) ion. The determination
of the rutin deprotonation state at the experimental conditions, pH
= 6.712 and pH = 7.20,28 is certainly of relevance since experimental access to
the degree of deprotonation is difficult. We found that, in the two
independent synthesis of metal complexes, distinct forms of rutin
(OH–C5 and O(−)–C5) are present. As
it is discussed in detail in ref (25), deprotonation of the OH5 is strongly facilitated
in the presence of Zn(II) ions, and it is a phenomenon that is time-dependent
and can be followed by the use of 1H NMR.

Complex 17 has the lowest Gibbs free energy of complex
formation in solution (thermodynamic product); however, it is not
predicted as the preferred structure on the basis of 1H
NMR spectroscopic analysis in DMSO solution, where complex 3 exhibited the best agreement with the experimental NMR profile but
has a disfavored positive energy of formation. Our results lead us
to conclude that calculation of energy of formation may not be the
best criterion to determine the observed structure in solution since
it depends on the chosen reaction model. A comparative analysis of
theoretical/experimental spectroscopic data seems more adequate. According
to our 1H NMR/UV–VIS analysis, the two experimental
synthesis of Zn(II)–Rutin complexes in DMSO and methanol solution
ended up with distinct mode of complexation, 1:2 and 2:1, respectively,
which may be seen as an intriguing experimental result strongly supported
by our theoretical 1H NMR and UV–VIS spectra calculations
in solution. In addition, our DFT-calculated solvation energies may
be considered as an estimate of flavonoid solubility. Therefore, our
results strongly indicate that complex 17 with a 2:1
stoichiometry [Zn2(H2O)4RutO4′O5]3+, having large stabilization energy
due to solvent effect, will exhibit improved solubility as compared
to free rutin, which has very low solubility in aqueous media, which
may be related to the observed increased biological property.

Computational
Methods
The predicted rutin geometry in DMSO solution reported
previously29 was used as a starting point
to optimize several
trial Zn(II)–Rutin complex structures employing the DFT10 method with the B3LYP functional30,31 using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set32 for
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms and effective core potential (ECP)
LANL2DZ33 for the Zn(II) metal. The gas
phase optimized geometries were used for DFT calculations of spectroscopic
properties in solution. DFT-calculated harmonic frequencies were used
to assess the main IR band, and UV–VIS data were computed according
to the TD-DFT formalism.341H NMR magnetic shielding constant (σ) calculations with chemical
shifts (δ) determined on a δ-scale relative to the TMS,
taken as a reference, were done using the gauge-independent atomic
orbital (GIAO) method.35 The polarizable
continuum model (PCM)36 approach was used
to describe solvent effects. As shown in previous works,29,37,38 the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)-PCM level
of theory can be considered sufficient for the evaluation of NMR chemical
shifts for CHn protons. All calculations
were performed with the Gaussian 09 package.39
