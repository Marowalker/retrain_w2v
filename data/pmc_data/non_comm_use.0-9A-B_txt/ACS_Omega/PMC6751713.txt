By
mimicking the water structure to improve the enzyme activity,
we designed imidazolium (Im)-based ionic liquids (ILs) functionalized
with both ether and tert-alcohol groups (e.g., [CH3(OCH2CH2)n-Im-t-BuOH][Tf2N]). This unique combination
of the “water-like” structure enabled very high transesterification
(synthetic) activities for immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica, which are up to 2–4 folds
higher than nonfunctionalized “classical” ionic liquids
(such as [BMIM][Tf2N]) and up to 40–100% higher
than diisopropyl ether and tert-butanol. Fluorescence
emission spectra confirmed the general protein structural preservation
in these tailored ionic solvents. In addition, functionalized ILs
showed high thermal stabilities, which are comparable with diisopropyl
ether but much higher than tert-butanol.

1 Introduction
Polyols
and sugars (e.g., sorbitol and trehalose) are known protein-stabilizing
compensatory solutes in aqueous solutions.1,2 For
instance, the thermal stability of glucose dehydrogenase in aqueous
polyols was improved by the type of polyols in the sequence of glycerol
< erythritol < xylitol < sorbitol.3 Polyols and sugars can increase the water’s surface tension,
leading to preferential hydration of proteins in aqueous solutions.1 Similarly, some alcohols and ethers as nonaqueous
media have been found highly compatible with enzymes following different
mechanisms. tert-Butanol is a common solvent for
lipase-catalyzed transesterification and ammoniolysis reactions, producing
relatively high enzyme activities; thus, many studies compared enzyme
activities in other media such as ionic liquids (ILs) with that in tert-butanol.4−10 Our recent study11 suggested that Novozym
435 (immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB)) was more active in tert-butanol than in
a number of ILs including ether-functionalized ILs, as assayed by
the transesterification reaction between ethyl sorbate and 1-propanol.
In addition, tert-butanol is less inhibitory to the
enzyme and less reactive as a substrate than 1-butanol (a primary
alcohol).4 Molecular dynamics simulations
of CALB indicate that lipase structure in tert-butanol
resembles that in three-site model (TIP3P) water; specifically, the
high enzyme compatibility of tert-butanol can be
attributed to several factors including high protein flexibility in tert-butanol, preservation of entrance size for the substrate
as well as the enzyme’s binding pocket size, and maintenance
of hydrogen bonding of Ser105 with His224 (in the active site of CALB,
Ser105–His224–Asp187 is the so-called “catalytic
triad”12,13).14

Some ethers are also benign solvents for nonaqueous biocatalysis.
Diisopropyl ether often leads to high lipase activities in enzymatic
transesterification reactions.15−18 Ethers (such as 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 2-ethoxyethyl
ether) have been found compatible with cross-linked enzyme aggregates
of Penicillin G acylase resulting in high conversions in enzymatic
acylation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid and d-phenylglycine
amide.19 For this reason, ether groups
have been incorporated into IL structures to develop enzyme-compatible
ionic solvents.20,21

However, enzyme activities
are typically lower in nonaqueous organic
solvents than in aqueous solutions by several magnitudes.22,23 As an example, proteases (i.e., α-chymotrypsin and subtilisin)
were 104–105 folds less active in neat
octane than in water.22 To develop “water-like”
nonaqueous solvents, we combined both features of tert-alcohols and ethers to design dual-functionalized ILs, hypothesizing
that the tailored structures offer both hydrogen-bond-donating (−OH)
and -accepting (R–O–R) properties and create “water-like”
environments for enzymes.

ILs functionalized with ether groups
have been synthesized and
utilized in enzymatic reactions.20,21,24 However, neither tert-alcohol-functionalized
ILs nor ILs dual-functionalized with alcohol and ether groups have
been developed for biocatalysis, although tert-alcohol-functionalized
imidazolium mesylate (CH3SO3−) ILs were
evaluated as effective phase-transfer catalysts (PTCs) in substitution
reactions including fluorination with high chemoselectivity.25−27 These mesylate salts also exhibited antimicrobial and antibiofilm
activities.28 Furthermore, the Chi and
Shinde groups29,30 covalently attached tert-alcohol-functionalized ILs onto polystyrene, resulting in reusable
solid PTCs for efficient aliphatic nucleophilic substitutions by alkali
metal salts. The present study aims to synthesize dual-functionalized
ILs by grafting both tert-alcohol and ether groups
to the cation core (such as imidazolium) and hypothesizes that these
ILs have high compatibility with the lipase (CALB), as assayed by
a transesterification reaction.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of Dual-Functionalized
ILs and
Their Compatibility with CALB
Dual-functionalized ILs carrying
both tert-alcohol and ether groups on their cations
were synthesized by a three-step reaction strategy (Scheme 1): (a) nucleophilic attack
of isobutylene oxide by imidazole; (b) nucleophilic substitution of tert-butanol-grafted imidazole with alkoxyalkyl halide;
(c) metathesis to replace halide anion with Tf2N– resulting in a hydrophobic IL. To prepare tert-alcohol-substituted
imidazole, the Arnold group31 mixed an
equal molar mixture of imidazole and epoxide in a high pressure ampoule
at 50 °C for 12 h; later, this method was further expanded to
the reactions of various epoxides with imidazole or benzimidazole.32 Following this approach, a number of tert-alcohol-functionalized imidazolium mesylate ILs were
synthesized.25−27 The drawback of this solventless approach of reacting
imidazole with epoxides is the formation of yellow/brown byproduct(s),
which is difficult to remove. Takemura et al.33 reacted benzimidazole with 2-methyl-2-phenyloxirane in ethanol with
the addition of sodium acetate by refluxing for 8 h. We adopted this
method by refluxing imidazole and isobutylene oxide in ethanol in
the presence of sodium acetate; sodium acetate became partially soluble
in ethanol and acted as a base to promote the ring-opening attack
of less substituted carbon in epoxide. Thus, this method is more regioselective
than other approaches. The structures and characterizations of our
dual-functionalized ILs are shown in the Supporting Information.

Scheme 1 Three-Step Synthesis of Dual-Functionalized ILs
The synthetic activity of Novozym 435 (immobilized C. antarctica lipase B (CALB)) in these ILs was assessed
by a highly sensitive synthetic reaction of ethyl sorbate with 1-propanol
(Scheme 2), which was
developed and evaluated by our group earlier.11,34,35 As illustrated in Table 1, the lipase in tert-butanol
(trial 1) and diisopropyl ether (trial 2) showed high synthetic activities
(6.23–8.57 μmol min–1 g–1 CALB). Due to their high compatibility with enzymes, these two organic
solvents have been used as “golden standards” in the
literature for comparing enzyme activities.4−10,15−18 Common enzyme-compatible ILs
(i.e., [BMIM][PF6], [BMIM][Tf2N], and [BMIM][BF4]) only afforded lipase activities in the range of 3.41–5.12
μmol min–1 g–1 CALB (trials
3–5 in Table 1). In these “classical” ILs, enzyme activities are
usually similar to or only slightly higher than that in tert-butanol4,5,7,8 and are typically below the activity in diisopropyl
ether.15,18 A single functionalization, tert-butanol-grafted [Et-Im-t-BuOH][Tf2N]
(trial 6), afforded a high lipase activity (8.04 μmol min–1 g–1 CALB) that is comparable with
diisopropyl ether. A longer alkyl chain-grafted IL [Bu-Im-t-BuOH][Tf2N] (trial 7) remains as a solid at
the reaction temperature (50 °C) and, thus, could not be used
as a solvent for this reaction. In contrast, several dual-functionalized
ionic liquids (trials 8, 11, 12, 14, and 15) led to very high CALB
activities in the range of 9.06–12.36 μmol min–1 g–1 CALB (with >99% selectivities, see Scheme 2), which are up to
2–4 folds higher than those in nonfunctionalized “classical”
ionic liquids, nearly double the activity in tert-butanol, and over 40% higher than that in diisopropyl ether. This
degree of enzyme activation has not been observed in the literature.
2-Methyl-substituted imidazolium IL (trial 16) showed a lower enzyme
activity of 6.97 μmol min–1 g–1 CALB, but it is still comparable with tert-butanol.
The water content has a drastic impact on lipase activity as assayed
by this transesterification reaction; when comparing trials 8, 9,
and 10 (0.02–0.05 wt % water) and trials 12 with 13 (0.01–0.02
wt % water), we found CALB activities decreased drastically from 12.36
to 5.66 and from 9.06 to 6.26 μmol min–1 g–1 CALB, respectively, even with a small increase in
water content. Therefore, a fine control of water content in ionic
solvents is critical for achieving high transesterification activities.

was conducted by adding ethyl sorbate (5 mM) and 1-propanol (0.67
M) in 1.0 mL of the solvent with the presence of 20 mg of Novozym
435 at 50 °C.

b A coulometric
Karl Fischer titrator
was used to measure the water contents at 22 °C with a Hydranal
Coulomat AG as the analyte.

c An Anton Paar SVM 3000 viscometer
was used to determine the dynamic viscosity and density data at 30
°C (except noted otherwise).

d The reaction mixture solidified
and no sample could be taken.

One aspect of these dual-functionalized ILs that needs improvement
is their relatively high dynamic viscosities (∼300 mPa s at
30 °C, see Table 1) although it was not problematic for the current transesterification
reaction at 50 °C (much less viscous, e.g., [CH3OCH2CH2-Im-t-BuOH][Tf2N]
has a viscosity of 71.5 mPa s at 50 °C); however, these viscosity
values appear much higher than those of [BMIM][Tf2N] (41.4
mPa s at 30 °C) and [CH3OCH2CH2-Im-Et][Tf2N] (33.1 mPa s at 30 °C).11 It is known that the covalent addendum of an ether group
to an ionic liquid usually reduces its viscosity, whereas the addition
of an alcohol group increases the viscosity (mainly due to hydrogen
bonding).39 Our current effort is underway
to fine-tune these IL structures to lower their viscosities while
maintaining their high enzyme compatibility.

2.2 Fluorescence
Spectra and Thermal Stability
of CALB in ILs
To assess protein structural changes in different
solvents, fluorescence emission spectroscopy is a convenient technique.
After CALB in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 20 mM) was excited at 280
nm, the emission maximum was observed at 313 nm due to both tryptophan
and tyrosine residues (Figure 1), which is used as a baseline spectrum for native enzyme
structure. One challenge in measuring fluorescence emission spectra
of enzymes in hydrophobic solvents is their poor solubility in these
media. Therefore, we added 10 μL of aqueous lipase (20 mg mL–1 CALB) into each solvent (1.0 mL) instead of enzyme
power for a number of considerations: (1) the final water content
in the mixture was kept low (1%, v/v) after adding aqueous droplets;
(2) aqueous lipase was easier to disperse in hydrophobic solvents
as small droplets than powder enzyme; (3) the amount of CALB used
was low (0.2 mg mL–1 overall); this low quantity
of lipase can be easily dispersed by using aqueous lipase than the
powder. Following this approach, all other CALB samples in different
solvents were excited at 280 nm, and the solvent emission spectra
were deducted (see Figures S1–S4 in the Supporting Information). Since CALB in aqueous droplets was
dispersed in hydrophobic solvents (such as Tf2N–-based ILs in Figure 1), the enzyme is not homogeneously distributed in hydrophobic solutions
when comparing with the case of lipase being fully solubilized in
aqueous solutions or hydrophilic ILs, which could cause different
spectrum profiles and signal-to-noise ratios. For this reason, the
change in fluorescence intensity maximum in hydrophobic solvents is
not a warrant of enzyme denaturation, but the shift in emission maximum
becomes more meaningful. As illustrated in Figure 1, CALB displayed the emission maximum at
315 nm in tert-butanol and 305 nm (blue shift) in
diisopropyl ether, which explains high lipase activities in these
two solvents; a more red shift in emission maximum (336 nm) in [CH3CH2OCH2CH2-MIm-t-BuOH][Tf2N] than that (322 nm) in [CH3CH2OCH2CH2-Im-t-BuOH][Tf2N] correlates with a lower CALB activity in the former IL
since the redshift often implies the protein denaturation.40 However, fluorescence emission spectra could
not fully explain why the lipase was much more active in some of these
functionalized ILs than in organic solvents.

Figure 1 Effect of solvents on
fluorescence emission spectra of CALB (0.2
mg mL–1 of free CALB dissolved or suspended in each
solvent; see fluorescence spectrophotometer conditions in the Section 4.4).

In addition to producing high enzyme activities, functionalized
ILs offer unique thermal stability for the lipase. As illustrated
in Figure 2, the thermal
stability of Novozym 435 was compared after its incubation at 50 °C
for 24–48 h in tert-butanol, diisopropyl ether,
[CH3OCH2CH2-Im-Et][Tf2N], or [CH3OCH2CH2-Im-t-BuOH][Tf2N]. The residual enzyme activity after 24–48
h of incubation at 50 °C in t-butanol was only
17–19%; in fact, the clear solution became cloudy after 24
h in tert-butanol implying the dissociation of CALB
from the beads or the partial dissolution of the acrylic beads. In
contrast, the thermal stability of lipase in diisopropyl ether and
two ILs was significantly higher: 81–92% residual activities
after 24 h and 65–69% residual activities after 48 h. Therefore,
the thermal stability of CALB in functionalized ILs is much higher
than that in tert-butanol. This finding is consistent
with our earlier study41 suggesting that
short-chain-glycol-grafted ILs were able to increase the lipase’s
thermal stability.

Reaction
conditions: a closed vial containing 20 mg of Novozym 435 and 1.0
mL of the solvent was placed in the 50 °C oil bath for 24 or
48 h under gentle agitation. At the end of incubation, the mixture
was cooled to room temperature, followed by the addition of ethyl
sorbate (50 μL, 100 mM in 1-propanol). The reaction mixture
was stirred in an oil bath at 50 °C. The lipase activity was
determined following the procedures in the Section 4.3.

3 Conclusions
Water-like dual-functionalized
ILs were synthesized by grafting
two functional groups (ether and tert-alcohol) onto
the imidazolium ring. These unique ionic solvents were found highly
compatible with lipase CALB in terms of high enzyme activities and
stabilities. Fluorescence emission spectra confirmed the characteristic
protein peak being generally maintained in dual-functionalized ILs.

Enzymes
purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) include C. antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a recombinant from Aspergillus
oryzae (catalog #62288, Lot #BCBP3380V) and Novozym
435 (CALB immobilized on the acrylic resin) (Catalog #L4777, Lot #SLBW1544).
2-Bromoethyl methyl ether and 2-bromoethyl ethyl ether were products
of BeanTown Chemical (Hudson, NH). Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
(Li[Tf2N]) was obtained from Matrix Scientific (Columbia,
SC). 1-Ethyl-3-(2-methoxyethyl)imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
([MeOCH2CH2-Im-Et][Tf2N]) was prepared
by our earlier study.24

4.2 Synthesis of Dual-Functionalized ILs
The synthesis
of a tert-butanol- and ether- dual-functionalized
ionic liquid (IL) was illustrated as an example. The first step was
to graft tert-butanol group onto the imidazolium
ring, which was a modification of a literature method.33 Imidazole (∼10 g, 1 equiv) and 2,2-dimethyloxirane
(1.2 equiv) were mixed in 100 mL of ethanol along with the addition
of sodium acetate (1.1 equiv). After refluxing for 24 h, the reaction
mixture was cooled first in the air to room temperature and was further
cooled in an ice bath. The salt was removed by vacuum filtration,
followed by vacuum evaporation of ethanol from the filtrate. The precipitated
salt was further filtered off (when needed, dichloromethane was added
to dilute the mixture). The crude product was dissolved in 100 mL
of dichloromethane and dried by anhydrous Na2SO4. After the salt was filtered off and the solvent was evaporated
under vacuum, a slightly yellow liquid product was obtained. (Note: N-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)imidazole is very soluble in
water; therefore, the extraction of the organic phase by water to
purify the product is proven to be inefficient.)

The second
step involved the alkylation of tert-butanol-grafted
imidazole to become an ionic salt. tert-Butanol-grafted
imidazole (∼10 g, 1.0 equiv) was mixed with 1.1 equiv alkyl
halide (such as 2-bromoethyl methyl ether) in 100 mL of anhydrous
acetonitrile. The reaction mixture was wrapped by an aluminum foil
to minimize light-initiated reactions and refluxed for 24 h. At the
end of the reaction, the solvent was removed under vacuum, the halide
compound was rinsed by diethyl ether twice (50 mL each time).

The third step was to convert halide to Tf2N– anion. Into the aqueous solution of halide salt (∼10 g, 1.0
equiv), aqueous lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li[Tf2N], 1.05 equiv) was added in drops at room temperature. The
mixture was stirred for 30 min and then sat still for a complete phase
separation; the bottom hydrophobic layer was dissolved in dichloromethane.
The mixture in a separatory funnel was extracted by deionized water
several times until no halide in the aqueous phase could be detected
by the silver nitrate test. After drying the organic layer by sodium
sulfate and evaporating dichloromethane, the hydrophobic IL was further
rinsed by n-heptane twice (50 mL each). The trace
amount of n-heptane was removed from IL by vacuum
evaporation. The purified IL in a small beaker was dried in a vacuum
oven (80 °C with 25 mmHg vacuum) for 1 week. The structure of
the dried IL was determined by 1H and 13C NMR,
MS spectra (see the Supporting Information).

4.3 Lipase-Catalyzed Transesterification between
Ethyl Sorbate and 1-Propanol
In a capped reaction vial, 50
μL of 1-propanol containing 100 mM ethyl sorbate was mixed with
1.0 mL of IL (or other solvents). The overall concentrations of ethyl
sorbate and 1-propanol in the reaction mixture were 5 mM and 0.67
M, respectively. After adding 20 mg of Novozym 435, the reaction mixture
was incubated and stirred in an oil bath at 50 °C. Periodically
in the first hour (each 15 min), 50 μL of the reaction mixture
was taken and diluted with 1.0 mL of methanol, followed by centrifugation
for 2 min. Then, the supernatant was transferred to an autosampler
vial for the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
The concentration of propyl sorbate was computed from its integrated
area using the standard curve of ethyl sorbate (as propyl sorbate
is not commercially available). Due to potential migration of traces
of sorbic acid and sorbate ester from Novozym 435 beads,34 control experiments were performed without the
addition of ethyl sorbate but with 50 μL of 1-propanol. For
this reason, all reported lipase activities were initial reaction
rates after deducting the control rates. The properly diluted reaction
mixtures were analyzed by LC-20AD Shimadzu HPLC using a SPD-20A UV–visible
dual-wavelength detector and an autosampler. The HPLC column used
was a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (100 mm × 4.6 mm in dimension,
2.6 μm in particle size). The flow rate was set at 1.0 mL min–1. The isocratic eluent consisted of 60:40 (v/v) methanol/water;
the UV–visible detection wavelength was 258 nm.

4.4 Fluorescence Emission Spectra of Free CALB
in ILs
A Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer was
used to capture the fluorescence emission spectra. The excitation
of CALB solution at 280 nm produced the emission of tyrosine and tryptophan
residues near 300 nm. Free CALB (10 μL, 20 mg mL–1 dissolved in pH 7.5, 20 mM phosphate buffer) was mixed with 1.0
mL of the solvent (phosphate buffer, organic solvent, or IL) in a
microcentrifuge tube through a gentle turning and shaking. The overall
lipase concentration was 0.2 mg mL–1. The enzyme
mixture was placed in a quartz cuvette (1.0 mL volume). Fluorescence
spectra were collected at room temperature (22 °C) except the
case of t-butanol at 30 °C (t-butanol has a low melting point of 25.8 °C).36 Both the excitation monochromator slit and the emission
monochromator slit width were set at 5 nm. Other parameters include
the photomultiplier voltage at 400 V and the response time of 0.08
s. The emission spectra were measured from 250 to 400 nm with a scanning
rate of 300 nm min–1. The emission spectrum of each
solvent itself was obtained under the same condition and subtracted
from the lipase emission spectrum in the same solvent.
