Uniform
positively charged polystyrene microspheres were synthesized
and further examined as a new sorbent for water remediation. The structures
of the resulting sorbent were characterized by field-emission scanning
electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The adsorption
performance of the sorbent was evaluated using three typical pollutants,
namely, Congo red, phosphate, and Cr(VI). The adsorption isotherms
were fitted by the Langmuir and Freundlich models, while the adsorption
kinetics was analyzed by the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order,
and intraparticle diffusion equations. The thermodynamic parameters
of the adsorption process including changes of enthalpy, entropy and
Gibbs free energy, and binding constant were obtained by isothermal
titration calorimetry measurements. The effects of solution pH and
competitive ions on the adsorption process were investigated. The
adsorption isotherms could be better fitted by the Langmuir model,
yielding maximum adsorption capacities of 18, 6.2, and 1.1 mg g–1 for the adsorption of Congo red, Cr(VI), and phosphate,
respectively. The adsorption kinetics could be best described by the
pseudo-second-order equation. The spent sorbent was regenerated by
washing with 1 M KOH and showed outstanding long-term cyclic performance.
The findings suggested that the positive charges at the surface of
polystyrene microspheres could serve as effective sites for the immobilization
of anionic pollutants in solutions owing to the electrostatic attraction.

1 Introduction
Accompanying
with industrialization and urbanization, various pollutants
are entering into water sources, giving rise to detrimental impacts
on human health and ecological systems. Congo red (CR), Cr(VI), and
phosphate are anionic pollutants in water.1−3 CR, a typical
synthetic dye, is always found in effluents from many industries such
as printing, textile, paper, plastics, and so forth. The presence
of CR in water is highly visible and significantly increases chemical
and biochemical oxygen demands.4−6 Being one of the notorious pollutants,
a trace of Cr(VI) is generally present in surface and ground waters
while high-concentration Cr(VI) can be found in effluents originated
from industrial processes such as electroplating, mining, and petroleum
refining processes.7 Cr(VI) is highly toxic,
mutagenic, and carcinogenic to living organisms.8−10 Phosphate is
one of the essential nutrients for plant growth.11 However, excess phosphate in water can stimulate the growth
of organisms and algae, leading to the death of aquatic life in water
bodies, which is the so-called eutrophication.12−14 Because of
the abovementioned harmful impacts, it is of great significance to
remove CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate from water sources.

To this
end, various physical, chemical, and biological methods
have been explored in different conditions, such as (bio)sorption,15 membrane filtration,16 precipitation,17 chemical reduction/oxidation,18 and microbial remediation.19 Among these approaches, sorption has been considered as
one of the most promising methods for water remediation because of
its high efficiency, simplicity of design, and ease of operation and
maintenance.20 In a typical sorption process,
the pollutant is separated from the solution by immobilizing to the
surface of the sorbent. The performance of the sorbent plays a decisive
role in the efficiency of the sorption process. Activated carbon has
been widely used as a sorbent to remove contaminants from water because
of its low cost. However, activated carbon always has limited adsorption
abilities particularly when the initial pollutant concentrations are
relatively low.21 Additionally, the adsorption
process based on activated carbon always takes long contact time,
which inhibits the practical applications. Thus, studies have been
devoted to exploring new sorbents for water purification. So far,
numerous sorbents, such as carbons,22−25 oxides,26−31 and polymers,32−35 have been reported. Unfortunately, most of these reported sorbents
suffer some drawbacks, such as unsatisfactory regeneration and cycling
ability. As a result, high-performance sorbents are desirable but
unfortunately still lacking. Recently, authors’ group has reported
an approach to prepare sulfonated polystyrene (PS) nanospheres which
showed outstanding ability to extract heavy metal ions from protein
solutions owing to the strong interaction between negatively charged
SO3– groups and positively charged metal
ions.36 Encouraged by this outcome, herein,
the authors synthesized monodispersed positively charged PS microspheres
to sequestrate CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate. A prominent advantage of
these functionalized PS microspheres lies in the positive charge,
which serve as effective sites for the immobilization of CR, Cr(VI),
and phosphate in solutions. The central objective of this work is
to reveal the adsorption characteristics of the adsorption processes.
The adsorption isotherms, thermodynamics, kinetics, regeneration,
and cyclic performance of the sorbent were investigated in detail.
In addition, the effects of solution pH and competitive ions were
also investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Material Synthesis and Characterization
The synthesis
procedure of positively charged PS–N+ microspheres
is illustrated in Scheme 1. It consists of four steps. In step I, PS microspheres
are synthesized via a typical radical polymerization
process, in which azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone
(PVP) are used as an initiator and surfactant, respectively. The PS
powder is purely white as seen from the digital photo. Field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images shown in Figure S4 reveal that the resulting PS microspheres are monodisperse
and possess a uniform diameter of ca. 1.4 um. In step II, nitro groups are grafted into the benzene rings of the PS via the
nitration reaction. The color of the resulting PS–NO2 powder turns into slight yellow. However, PS–NO2 has no distinct morphological change as shown in Figure S5. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images
reveal the distribution of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The latter
two elements are ascribed to the nitro groups, manifesting the success
of the nitration reaction. In step III, the nitro groups
are reduced into amino groups. During the reduction process, NaBH4 and (NH4)2SO4 are served
as a reducing agent and catalyst, respectively. The PS–NH2 powder is of a salmon-like color and composed of uniform
microspheres (see Figure S6). Carbon, oxygen,
and nitrogen elements are noted from the EDX mapping images. Further
analyses indicate that the content of oxygen in PS–NH2 is significantly reduced relative to that in PS–NO2. In step IV, the positively charged groups are introduced
via a quaternization reaction in which glycidyl trimethyl ammonium
chloride (GTAC) is used as a quaternization reagent, while HClO4 is used to control the pH of the solution. The resulting
PS–N+ powder is yellowish. FESEM images, shown in Figure 1, reveal that PS–N+ is still monodisperse and well preserves a uniform spherical
structure, manifesting that the aforementioned reactions only take
place at the surface of the microspheres.

Figure 1 FESEM images of PS–N+ recorded at magnifications
of (a) 1 k and (b) 3 k, and EDX analysis results of (c) image, (d)
carbon, (e) oxygen, and (f) nitrogen distributions.

PS–N+ Microspheres. GTAC: (CH3)3N+CH2CH2OCH2Cl–
The structures of the samples
were studied by Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as shown in Figure 2. A comparative inspection could reveal that
a distinct adsorption peak at 870 cm–1 is noted
from the spectra of the PS–NO2, PS–NH2, and PS–N+ samples, which can be ascribed
to the stretching vibration of C–N bonds. Two peaks located
at 1300 and 1550 cm–1 are also noted from the spectra
of the PS–NO2, PS–NH2, and PS–N+ samples, which could be assigned to the N–O stretching
vibration. This result suggests that the PS–NH2 and
PS–N+ samples still contain some nitro groups owing
to the incomplete reduction, which is consistent with the EDX results.
The spectra in the range of 3200–3800 cm–1 also well illustrate the variations of the functional groups. For
the PS and PS–NO2 samples, no peak is observed in
this range. In contrast, the PS–NH2 sample exhibits
a broad peak centered around 3500 cm–1 which is
the characteristic of NH2 groups. This peak is significantly
depressed as evidenced from the spectrum of the PS–N+ sample because of the quaternization reaction. To further investigate
the structures of the samples, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra of the samples are recorded (see Figure S7). It can be seen that the spectrum of the PS is
different from those of the PS–NO2, PS–NH2, and PS–N+ samples, which is attributed
to the grafting of functional groups in the benzene rings. However,
the differences in the spectra of the PS–NO2, PS–NH2, and PS–N+ are limited. This could be explained
from the fact that the number of the substituted groups is low because
the modifications occur only at the surface of the microspheres.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra
of the samples.

The powered samples were
dispersed in distilled water by ultrasonication
to form stable suspensions with a concentration of 10 mg L–1. The conductivity of the suspension was recorded at room temperature
as shown in Figure 3. For reference, the conductivity of distilled water is determined
to be 1.5 μS cm–1. The PS–N+ suspension exhibits the largest conductivity of 5.1 μS cm–1, which is 3.4, 2.4, 2.04, and 1.34 times those of
distilled water, PS, PS–NO2, and PS–NH2, respectively. This is exactly attributed to the positive
charges at the surface of the PS–N+ microspheres.

2.2 Adsorption Isotherms and Thermodynamics
It has been demonstrated that positively charged groups are successfully
grafted into the benzene rings and that the resulting PS–N+ well maintains a monodispersed spherical structure. Such
structural features render it as a promising sorbent for water purification.
As a proof of concept, the adsorption performance of PS–N+ was evaluated by three typical pollutants, namely, CR, phosphate,
and Cr(VI). The adsorption characteristics of PS–N+ toward these three pollutants were studied in detail. First of all,
the adsorption performance of the four samples was compared as shown
in Figure S8. It shows that PS–N+ possesses the largest adsorption capacities of the three
pollutants, indicating that the positively charged groups in the PS–N+ microspheres play an essential role in immobilizing the pollutants.
The adsorption isotherms of PS–N+ were recorded,
as shown in Figure 4. It shows that the adsorption uptake initially increases with increasing
equilibrium concentrations and then reaches a plateau stage at high
concentrations. To determine the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity,
the adsorption isotherms were analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich
models as expressed by eqs 1 and 2, respectively. 1   2  where qmax (mg
g–1) is the maximum adsorption capacity, b (L mg–1) is the Langmuir adsorption
constant, and k (mg1–1/n·L1/n·g–1) and n are the Freundlich constants associated
with adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity, respectively. The
resulting fitting curves are displayed in Figure S9. The corresponding fitting parameters are listed in Table S1. Modeling results indicate that, compared
with the Freundlich model, the Langmuir model is more applicable for
the description of the adsorption data. PS–N+ has
theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of 18, 6.2, and 1.1 mg g–1 for the adsorption of CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate,
respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities are well correlated
with the molecular weight of the substrates, indicating that the major
adsorption sites are the positively charged groups. It is worth noting
that the adsorption of CR shows the largest adsorption constant b value because each CR molecule has two negative charges
arisen from two SO3– groups while Cr(VI)
and phosphate in the forms of HCrO4– and
H2PO4–, respectively, have
only one negative charge, leading to the strongest electrostatic interaction
between PS–N+ and CR. It should be pointed out that
the maximum capacity is smaller than those of the sorbents reported
in the literature.37−40 This could be because of the limited number of the positive charges
in the surface of PS–N+.

Figure 4 Adsorption isotherms
of (a) CR, (b) phosphate ions, and (c) Cr(VI).

To gain in-depth understanding of the adsorption process,
isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed. Figure 5 displays the thermograms.
The resulting parameters including changes of enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), Gibbs free energy
(ΔG), binding constant (Kd), and the number of binding sites (N) are
summarized in Table S2. For the thermogram
of CR (Figure 5a),
clear thermonegative peaks are noted for the initial injections and
gradually changed to thermopositive. In contrast, for the thermograms
of phosphate (Figure 5b) and Cr(VI) (Figure 5c), only thermonegative peaks appear during the whole titration process.
The ΔG values of the processes are negative,
indicative of that the processes are thermodynamically favorable.
The ΔS values of the processes are positive,
suggesting that the binding of the sorbates to the PS–N+ increases the structural disorder of the systems. The ΔH values of the adsorption of phosphate (−4.7 kcal
mol–1) and Cr(VI) (−3.71 kcal mol–1) are negative while that of CR (3.08 kcal mol–1) is positive. These results reveal that the spontaneous binding
of CR to PS–N+ is mainly driven by ΔS of the process. In contrast, both ΔS and ΔH play a role in the adsorption of Cr(VI)
and phosphate. Similar to the parameter b in the
Langmuir model, the Kd value is closely
related to the adsorption intensity. The adsorption of CR shows the
smallest Kd value, indicating the strongest
binding strength, which is attributed to the two negative charges
of CR molecules.

(b) phosphate,
and (c) Cr(VI).

2.3 Adsorption
Kinetics
The adsorption
kinetics was studied. The concentrations of the sorbates are monitored
as a function of contact time as shown in Figure 6. To investigate the kinetics of the process,
three kinetic models including the pseudo-first-order,41 pseudo-second-order,42 and intraparticle diffusion43 equations
were employed to analyze the data.

Figure 6 Concentrations of (a) CR, (b) phosphate
ions, and (c) Cr(VI) recorded
as a function of time.

The fitting curves are shown in Figure S10 and the resulting parameters are listed in Table S3. The experimental data are best fitted by the pseudo-second-order
equation. On the basis of the pseudo-second-order equation, the equilibrium
adsorption uptakes of CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate are determined to
be 8.89, 2.27, and 0.3 mg g–1, corresponding to
rate constants of 51.1, 0.406, and 1.59 min–1, respectively.
The largest equilibrium adsorption uptake of CR is attributed to its
large molecular weight while the remarkable rate constant could be
explained from the two negative charges per molecule.

2.4 Effects of Solution pH
It is well
known that Cr(VI) and phosphate can form various species in different
solution pHs (see Figure S11). For Cr(VI),
there are following equilibrium reactions in solutions11,44 3   4   5  

Taking Cr(VI)
as an example, the effects
of solution pH in the adsorption process were studied. The adsorption
isotherms were recorded at pHs of 3, 4.8, 6.6, and 9 as shown in Figure 7a. It shows that
the adsorption uptake decreases with increasing solution pHs. The
adsorption isotherms were further fitted by the Langmuir model (see Figure S12) and the resulting modeling results
are listed in Table S4. The maximum theoretical
adsorption capacities of Cr(VI) were determined to be 7.1, 6.2, 6.1,
and 4.6 mg g–1 at solution pHs of 3, 4.8, 6.6, and
9, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity decreases with increasing
pH. This could be related to the formation of CrO42– in high-solution pHs, whose adsorption over PS–N+ could involve more sites. The effects of solution pH in the
adsorption kinetics were also explored. Figure 7b shows the variations of Cr(VI) concentration
at different solution pHs. The concentration of Cr(VI) rapidly decreases
and reaches to an equilibrium state within 20 min, indicating the
fast adsorption kinetics. The kinetic data were well fitted by the
pseudo-second-order equation as shown in Figure S13, and the resulting parameters are listed in Table S5. The equilibrium adsorption uptakes
of Cr(VI) were 2.3, 2.2, 1.7, and 1.4 mg g–1, corresponding
to rate constants of 0.24, 0.4, 1.1, and 1.86 min–1, at pHs of 3, 4.8, 6.6 and 9, respectively. Interestingly, at high
pHs, adsorption of Cr(VI) showed lower equilibrium uptakes but larger
rate constant values. This could also be explained from the presence
of CrO42– in high-solution pHs. The adsorption
of this species involves more binding sites and stronger binding strength
with the PS–N+ sorbent.

and (b) adsorption kinetics of Cr(VI)
at different pHs.

2.5 Effects
of Competitive Ions
The effects
of competitive negative nitrate ions in the adsorption process were
also investigated. Figure 8a comparatively shows the isotherms of the adsorption of CR
with and without nitrate ions. It can be seen that in the presence
of 0.01 M NO3–, the adsorption uptakes
are lower than those obtained in the absence of 0.01 M NO3–. Based on the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption
capacity of CR in the presence of 0.01 M NO3– was determined to be 17.1 mg g–1, which is slightly
smaller than that of 18 for the single adsorption of CR. Figure 8b shows the effects
of NO3– in the adsorption kinetics. Further
fitting analyses based on the pseudo-second-order equation indicate
that with the addition of 0.01 M NO3– in the pollutant solution, the equilibrium adsorption uptake decreases
from 8.9 to 8.6 mg g–1 while the rate constant decreases
from 51.1 to 3.64 min–1. These findings suggest
that the presence of NO3– shows limited
effects in the adsorption kinetics.

isotherms and (b) kinetics of CR.

2.6 Regeneration and Recyclability
To
study the regeneration and recyclability of the sorbent, cyclic adsorption–desorption
tests were further conducted. CR- and Cr(VI)-saturated PS–N+ microspheres were regenerated by washing with 1 M KOH. It
was found that the desorption process was also fast and could be completed
in several minutes. This adsorption–desorption process was
repeated eight times and the adsorption uptakes were recorded as a
function of cycle number as shown in Figure 9. It shows that the adsorption uptakes of
CR and Cr(VI) are quite stable, indicating that the PS–N+ sorbent can be facilely regenerated and possess outstanding
long-term cyclic performance. The morphology of the pollutant-saturated
PS–N+ microspheres was further observed by FESEM
as shown in Figures S14–S16. It
can be seen that the spent sorbents well preserve the spherical structure.
Elemental analyses indicate that additional sulfur, chromium, and
phosphorus elements are noted from the spent adsorbents after the
adsorption of CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate, respectively.

PS–N+ for the adsorption
of (a) CR and (b) Cr(VI).

3 Conclusions
Monodispersed positively
charged PS microspheres were fabricated
for the removal of CR, phosphate, and Cr(VI). The adsorption isotherms
were better fitted by the Langmuir model, yielding maximum adsorption
capacities of 18, 6.2, and 1.1 mg g–1 for the adsorption
of CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate, respectively. The adsorption kinetics
was best described by the pseudo-second-order equation, resulting
in rate constants of 51.1, 0.406, and 1.59 min–1 for the adsorption of CR, Cr(VI), and phosphate, respectively. ITC
results indicated that the spontaneous adsorption of CR to PS–N+ was mainly driven by the entropy change while the changes
of both entropy and enthalpy played a role in the adsorption of Cr(VI)
and phosphate. At high-solution pHs, the PS–N+ microspheres
showed low adsorption uptakes but large adsorption rate constants,
which could be explained from the formation of CrO42–. The presence of competitive NO3– ions had limited influence on the adsorption uptakes of CR but significantly
decreased the rate constants. The spent sorbent could be facilely
regenerated by washing with 1 M KOH and showed outstanding long-term
cyclic performance.

24 h. For convenience, the resulting product was denoted as PS–N+.

4.6 Material Characterization
The morphology
of the samples was observed by FESEM (JSM-7600F, JEOL). An EDX analyzer
equipped in FESEM was used to analyze the elemental composition of
the samples. The structures of the samples were analyzed by 1H NMR (JOEL, JNM-ECA 600 MHz) and FTIR (AV360). The conductivity
of the suspension was measured by a conductivity analyzer (DDS-11A)
at room temperature.

4.7 Batch Adsorption Tests
To study the
adsorption kinetics, 100 mg of PS–N+ was added into
30 mL of CR solution (initial concentration = 30 mg L–1), while 150 mg of PS–N+ was separately added into
12 mL of phosphate solution (initial concentration = 10 mg L–1) and 25 mL of dichromate solution (initial concentration = 10 mg
L–1). The mixture was agitated at 180 rpm using
a mechanical shaker at 25 °C. At given time intervals, 0.5 mL
of aliquot was sampled and filtered through a membrane filter (pore
diameter = 220 nm) to remove the sorbent. The concentration of the
pollutant was determined using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(North point Rayleigh UV-1801). The concentrations of the pollutants
are well correlated with the intensity of the maximum adsorption peak
(λmax). The λmax value of CR solution
is located at 497 nm as shown in Figure S1. Notably, the λmax values of dichromate solutions
are dependent on solution pH. The λmax values of
the dichromate solutions are determined to be 257 and 273 nm at pHs
of 3 and 9, respectively (see Figure S2). The measurement of phosphate concentration is relatively complicated.45 The details of the experimental procedures are
listed as follows: 50 mL of 5 M H2SO4, 5 mL
of l-antimony potassium tartrate solution (0.55 wt %), 15
mL of ammonium molybdate solution (8 wt %), and 30 mL of 0.2 M ascorbic
acid solution were mixed. 0.5 mL of the mixed solution was added into
2 mL of the phosphate solution. After shaking, the solution was transferred
for analysis. The concentration of phosphate was determined from λmax = 880 nm (see Figure S3).

The adsorption uptake qt (mg g–1) at time t (min) was
determined by eq 6 6  where C0 and Ct (mg L–1) are the initial and constant concentrations
in the liquid phase,
respectively, V (L) is the solution volume, and W (g) is the sorbent weight. To obtain the equilibrium adsorption
capacity qe (mg g–1),
10 mg of PS–N+ powder was separately introduced
into CR, phosphate, and dichromate solutions with volumes of 7, 2,
and 4 mL, respectively, with predetermined initial concentrations.
The sorbent was dispersed in the pollution solution for at least 24
h to achieve an equilibrium state of adsorption.

To study the
regeneration and recyclability of the PS–N+ sorbent,
cyclic adsorption–desorption tests were conducted.
A 100 mg of PS–N+ was separately added into 20 mL
of CR solution with a concentration of 50 mg L–1 and 10 mL of dichromate solution with a concentration of 30 mg L–1 under continuous magnetic stirring. The adsorption
process was conducted at 25 °C for at least 12 h. Subsequently,
pollutant-saturated PS–N+ was regenerated by immersing
into 1 M KOH. The regenerated PS–N+ was collected
by centrifugation and washed with water. The regenerated sorbent was
employed again to remove pollutants from the solutions. This adsorption–desorption
process was repeated eight times. The adsorption uptake was recorded
as a function of cycle numbers.

4.8 ITC Tests
ITC (PEAQ-ITC, Malvern)
was employed to measure the heat exchange during the adsorption process.
Typically, a suspension of PS–N+ with a concentration
of 5 mg L–1 was added into the cell. 0.4 μL
of 1 mM pollutant solution was injected into the cell using a syringe
within 4 s under stirring (700 rpm). Subsequently, 18 drops of the
adsorbate solution with a volume of 0.2 μL were injected with
a time interval of 150 s. The titration process was conducted at 25
°C.
