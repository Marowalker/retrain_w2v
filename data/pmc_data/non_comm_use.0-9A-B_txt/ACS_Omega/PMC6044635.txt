Here, we demonstrated chimeric adeno-associated
virus (chimeric
AAV), AAV-DJ-mediated cardiovascular reprogramming strategy to generate
new cardiomyocytes and limit collagen deposition in cardiac fibroblasts
by inducing synergism of chimeric AAV-expressing Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5
(AAV-GMT)-mediated heart reprogramming and chimeric AAV-expressing
thymosin β4 (AAV-Tβ4)-mediated heart regeneration. AAV-GMT
promoted a gradual increase in expression of cardiac-specific genes,
including Actc1, Gja1, Myh6, Ryr2, and cTnT, with a gradual decrease
in expression of a fibrosis-specific gene, procollagen type I and
here AAV-Tβ4 help to induce GMT expression, providing a chimeric
AAV-mediated therapeutic cell reprogramming strategy for ischemic
heart diseases.

1 Introductuon
Cardiovascular
disease is caused by reduced or blocked blood supply
to the heart muscle, which is usually associated with damages to the
arteries, leading to the heart failure. It is the primary silent killer,
constituting the major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality.
There is as yet no effective treatment because postnatal cardiomyocytes
(CMs) have little regenerative capacity, indicating that cardiac regeneration
and/or angiogenesis strategies should be developed for treatment.1 Owing to the advent of stem cell technologies,
we now have several options for cardiac regeneration.2 The first approach is to supply functional CMs directly
to the ischemic site; however, there are issues with this approach,
such as cell delivery, integration, rejection, and cellular maturation,1,3 as well as obtaining enough number of pure CMs. Other approaches
include the use of proximal lineage cells, such as cardiac progenitor
cells4,5 or stimulation of resident stem cells surrounding
ischemic sites in the heart by inductive signals.6 However, there are many barriers for obtaining the expected
therapeutic efficiency, such as obtaining enough functional stem cells
to generate functional CMs and promote tissue regeneration and overcoming
fibrosis. The recent transdifferentiation technology of reprogramming
fibroblasts into CMs7 is a very attractive
method because it provides a fast route for generating functional
CMs to replace cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) residing in the ischemic
area. However, the efficiency of the approach7,8 is
very low (∼5% cardiac gene+/reporter gene+ cells after 1 week). Efforts have been made to improve the efficiency
by addition or modification of transcription factors and the use of
miRNAs and/or small molecules; however, the efficiency still needs
to be improved for further application.9−12

In vivo reprogramming,
compared with in vitro reprogramming, can
be assisted by the native environment, coupled with neighboring cells
(“the niches”), to promote cell survival and maturation,
thereby showing higher efficiency.8,9,13−15 However, these promising and
advanced methods are dependent on retroviral or lentiviral systems,
and are thus not yet feasible for further clinical application for
safety reasons. For clinical translation of an in vivo cardiac reprogramming
strategy, finding an alternative biomaterial with gene delivery function
that is safe and efficient and can deliver the defined cardiogenic
transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT), into the ischemic
sites is therefore a major prerequisite.16−18 Many researchers
have utilized nanosized natural19,20 or synthetic materials,21,22 protein or peptide nanospheres,23,24 and polymersomes25,26 and virus-based vehicles27−31 to transfer some genetic information/function into target cells.

Cardiotropic vector, such as adeno-associated virus (AAV), capable
of sustained expression of therapeutic proteins32,33 can thus be considered as designed viral nanoparticles (VNPs) for
gene therapy to promote myocardial protection and rescue. VNPs can
provide controllable design and engineering and batch-to-batch consistency,
compared to synthetic or natural protein preparation. The AAV is a
nonpathogenic VNP with a linear single-stranded DNA genome that contains
inverted terminal repeats at each AAV genome terminus for expressing
eukaryotic functional gene.34,35 Herein, we investigated
the use of AAV, a safe and effective gene delivery system because
these viruses do not integrate unexpectedly into the host genome and
are not as immunogenic as adenovirus.36,37 AAVs infect
a relatively broad range of cells efficiently, whereas other viruses
have a limited range of host cell types they can infect.38,39 The safety and usage of AAV for clinical settings was approved by
the European Medicine Agency in 2012.40 The merits of using AAV for our study include that it can transduce
dividing and nondividing cells, as well as provide nonpathogenic,
efficient transduction, persistent gene expression, and low immunogenicity.

In addition, a clinical benefit can be expected from adjuvant neovascularization
therapies (angiogenesis/arteriogenesis) in ischemic diseases of the
heart or peripheral muscle. To increase the effect of the AAV-transgene
system for in vivo cardiac reprogramming, therefore, we adopted the
approach of stimulating blood vessel formation by providing angiogenic
growth factors that are suitable for the treatment of vascular insufficiencies.41−43 Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) is an actin-sequestering protein to
rearrange cytoskletal proteins and thus participates in cell motility.
It stimulates endothelial cell migration, adhesion, and tubule formation
involved in angiogenesis44 and can induce
the differentiation of epicardial progenitor cells into endothelial
cells.45,46 It also attenuates the inflammatory response,
protects from apoptosis,47,48 and enhances the survival,
proliferation, and migration of cardiac cells,49 thereby demonstrating its potential for cardiac repair.50 Tβ4 also serves as an antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory,
and angiogenic protein to protect and facilitate regeneration of injured
or damaged tissues.40,44−48,51 Its antifibrotic effects
on cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in vitro and in vivo showed a cardioprotective
effect,52,53 which is from the inhibition of collagen
synthesis was mediated by its specific receptor.54 Its angiogenic and antifibrotic effects are associated
with the normalization of organ function.46 Importantly, AAV-Tβ4 has recently been described as a powerful
tool to promote micro- and macrovessel growth in murine and porcine
species.55 Herein, we used AAV-expressing
thymosin β4 (AAV-Tβ4), together with AAV-GMT, as a combined
treatment to promote ischemic heart repair in an acute myocardial
ischemia model. The direct intramyocardial injection of retroviral
vectors expressing GMT with pretreatment of thymosin β4 peptide
has previously been introduced.13 Similarly,
the chimeric AAV-DJ capsid was previously used to deliver GMT to mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) in vitro.18 However, to our knowledge this is the first report of using chimeric
AAV-DJ to deliver GMT + Tβ4 to post-infarct mouse hearts for
a highly efficient in vivo cardiac reprogramming strategy with clinically
applicable potency. We proposed that this clinically available AAV-mediated
system can be used for cardiovascular regeneration, by achieving synergism
of GMT-mediated heart repair and effects of Tβ4, an angiogenic
and cardioprotective peptide, to improve the system efficacy (Figure 1).

AAV-GMT and AAV-Tβ4. AAV-mediated cardiac repair and regeneration
by achieving GMT-based cardiac conversion and Tβ4-based angiogenic
niche regeneration. Chimeric AAV-mediated niches induced by GMT and
Tβ4 can work successfully to improve heart function. This AAV-based
synergism can be easily achieved and has promise as the next therapeutic
strategy for cardiovascular disease.

2 Results and Discussion
We used AAV-DJ56,57 to produce capsid and rep proteins
and AAV-Helper to aid the assembly of AAV-transgenes and produce the
required AAV-transgene viruses. AAV-DJ was engineered using DNA shuffling
technology, which created a chimeric capsid, resulting in chimeric
AAV with broad-range tropism and with higher efficiency for fibroblasts.
Transgene cassettes (AAV-Gata4, -Mef2c, -Tbx5, -Tβ4, and -GFP)
driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter were constructed and produced
using AAV-DJ and Helper (Figure 2a). AAV-GFP was coinfected to allow the assessment
of virus transduction. Functionality was further confirmed by transduction
of 293T, MEFs, and mouse cardiac fibroblast (MCFs) at a dose of 1
× 108 genome copies per 25 T flask (Figure 2b). 293 T showed over 80% transduction
efficiency (GFP+ cells/total cells) 3 days after transduction.
Of note, AAV-mediated transgene expression gradually increased in
MEFs and MCFs, which reached ∼60–80% at 1 week after
transduction and lasted for 4 weeks. Over 80% MCF transduction efficiency
was observed at 28 days (Figure 2c).

(b) long-last expressions of transgenes in mouse fibroblasts (MEF:

To investigate how well GMT and
Tβ4 in an AAV system work
for heart reprogramming and/or heart regeneration, four experimental
groups were used and AAV-GFP was coinfected to allow the assessment
of virus transduction: AAV-GFP (no GMT or Tβ4; group 1; GFP
group), AAV-GFP + AAV-GMT (group 2; GMT group), AAV-GFP + AAV-Tβ4
(group 3; Tβ4 group), and AAV-GFP + AAV-GMT + AAV-Tβ4
(group 4; GMTTβ4 group). Primary MCFs cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) were transduced with the AAV-transgene cassettes, and the cardiac
gene expression was examined in transduced cells in each group. The
dose of each vector was held constant between groups. Immunofluorescent
staining of cTnT and vimentin (VIM; fibroblast maker) showed that
the virus-infected (GFP-expressing) cells in the GMT, Tβ4, or
GMTTβ4 group gradually increased the expression of cTnT and
decreased the expression of VIM, whereas the GFP group (AAV-GFP only)
showed no cTnT expression and high VIM expression (Figure S1). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the expression
of the cardiomyocyte-specific genes, Actc1 (cardiac
α-actin), Gja1 (gap junction α1-protein;
connexin 43), Myh6 (α-myosin heavy chain), Ryr2 (ryanodine receptor 2), and cTnT (cardiac
troponin T; cardiomyocyte marker), gradually increased in a time-dependent
manner (Figure S2a). The gradual increase
in GMT expression in AAV-Tβ4-transduced cells (Figure S2b) showed that Tβ4 may somehow contribute positively
to GMT activity.

Correlation between GFP expression (AAV-transgene
transduced cells)
and cardiac-specific proteins expression, cTnT and Sarcomeric α
actinin (αSA), as for cardiomyocyte conversion, was then examined
(Figure 3). The white
regions in the cells show GFP expression, whereas co-localized regions
of cTnT expression with GFP are shown in green (Figure 3a, up), which is opposite in terms of co-localized
regions of VIM expression with GFP (Figure 3b, bottom). Transduction efficiencies (GFP+ cells/total cells) at day 28 were ∼80 and ∼60%
in MCFs and MEFs, respectively. The cTnT-expressing cells were counted
and expressed as a percentage of GFP-expressing cells (cTnT+ cells/GFP+ cells), with 0, 55 ± 7, 13 ± 11,
and 67 ± 24% in MCFs and 0, 20 ± 1, 23 ± 4, and 57
± 15% in MEFs, for groups 1–4 (Figure 3b). cTnT expression was highest in the GMTTβ4
group (Figure 3b).
αSA staining also showed that the GMTTβ4 group had the
highest αSA staining (Figure 3c). Interestingly, the relative RNA expression of Col1a2,
a fibrosis-specific gene, was highest only in the GFP-only group (Figure 3d).

expression. (a) Co-localization with GFP regions were shown in green.

group.

Next, in vivo efficacy of AAV-transgene
transfer into the mouse
myocardial infarction (MI) model was examined. Mouse MI model was
mimicked by left anterior descending (LAD) ligation. Mice were randomly
divided into four groups (AAV-GFP only, GFP; AAV-GMT, GMT; AAV-Tβ4,
Tβ4; and AAV-GMT plus Tβ4, GMTTβ4). After ligation,
each group of mice received an intramyocardial injection of their
specified AAV-transgenes at a dose of 1 × 109 genome
copies per transgene, keeping the dose of vector bearing each transgene
constant between groups. To check whether AAV-GMT, AAV-Tβ4,
and AAV-GMTTβ4 promote cardiac repair may be via in vivo reprogramming.
Improved heart repair can be observed first by Masson’s trichrome
and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 4a, up). The GMT, Tβ4, and GMTTβ4
groups showed significant improvement with a decreased fibrotic area
and increased wall thickness, compared to the GFP group (Figure 4a, bottom). Importantly,
the GMTTβ4 group showed significantly enhanced improvement compared
to the other groups.

(Masson’s trichrome) and H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) staining

Infarct size was presented as a percentage of the left ventricular
free wall circumferential length, and infarct wall thickness was presented
as a percentage of the thickness of septal wall (data are represented
as mean ± standard deviation (SD), n = 5, *p < 0.01). (b) CD31 and GFP expression and PCNA and caspase-3
expression (up). Enhanced vessel growth and survival were observed
in the combined treatment group (down) (data are represented as mean
± SD, n = 3, *p < 0.01,
**p < 0.05 vs the GFP group, scale bar = 20 μm).

Improved heart structure by AAV-GMTTβ4
may be attained by
in vivo cardiac reprogramming, first by GMT and then remodeling of
injured tissues by Tβ4.13,40,44−48,51 To investigate the antifibrotic
effect and further assess the in vivo cardiac reprogramming, αSA
(Actn2), compared to collagen type I (Col1a2), expression was analyzed
in each group. Immunostaining of αSA and collagen type I (COI)
(Figure S3a, up) was performed. The percent
ratio of the COI-stained area versus the αSA-stained area was
lowest in the GMTTβ4 group and lower in the GMT and Tβ4
groups compared to the GFP group, in the order GMTTβ4 < GMT
< Tβ4 < GFP. The αSA ratio was reversed and highest
in the GMTTβ4 group (GMTTβ4 > GMT > Tβ4 >
GFP; Figure S3a, bottom). This correlation
between
the reduced fibrotic area (COI expression) and increased cardiac area
(αSA expression) suggests that the fibrotic area is converted
into cardiac tissue (meaning in vivo cardiac reprogramming). cTnT-expressing
cells among GFP+ cells were also found in the AAV-transgene-treated
groups (Figure S3b, up). Co-localized regions
of the GFP-expressing area (the virus-infected region) with cTnT expression
are examined. The average percentage of coexpressing cells (cTnT+/GFP+) was determined to be ∼2% in GFP,
∼22% in GMT, ∼7% in Tβ4, and ∼32% in GMTTβ4
groups (Figure S3b, bottom). From these
results, we conclude that GMTTβ4 is the most effective combination
for cardiac reprogramming.

Improved heart repair by Tβ4
co-treatment may be also related
to its angiogenic effects. When we investigated CD31 expression with
GFP in AAV-transgene-transduced cardiac tissue (Figure 4b up; CD31 in red, GFP in green), enhanced
blood vessel formation was found, which may enhance regeneration/survival
and reduce cell death (Figure 4b up; PCNA for proliferating cells in red, caspase-3 for dead
cells in green). Enhanced vessel formation seems to be primarily induced
by Tβ4 and was highest in the co-treatment group (Figure 4b, bottom). This was also associated
with heart regeneration/survival (PCNA+ cells in Figure 4b, bottom). Reduced
numbers of caspase-3-expressing cells may be related to cardiac repair/reprogramming.
The co-treated group showed the lowest number of caspase-3-expressing
cells, followed by the GMT group (caspase+ cells, Figure 4b, bottom).

AAVs are currently the leading candidates for virus-based gene
therapies because of their broad tissue tropism, nonpathogenic nature,
and low immunogenicity. They have been approved for the clinical treatment
of lipoprotein lipase deficiency in Europe.21,45,46 In addition, many engineered AAV variants,
with novel and biomedically valuable cell tropism, are now available.35,46 In this study, AAV-DJ was used to construct chimeric AAV-Gata4,
-Mef2c, -Tbx5, and -Tβ4. Gradual and long-lasting (even after
28 days) expression in cardiac fibroblasts was confirmed. A gradual
increase in cardiac-specific gene expression, with a gradual decrease
in fibrosis-specific gene expression, correlated with GMT transduction
and was contributed to by Tβ4. This is in accordance with a
previous report that Tβ4 plays a role in inducing epicardial
progenitor-derived de novo cardiomyocytes and neovascularization,27,30 in addition to its original role in endothelial cell stimulation.
It is likely that Tβ4 stimulates the niche resident stem cells
in cardiac tissues. It is likely that Tβ4 also stimulates stem
cells residing in the cardiac niche, consistent with the cTnT-stimulating
effect of Tβ4 on MCF and MEF cells in vitro, as shown in (Figure 3b).

Improved
heart repair was in accordance with these findings. The
αSA to COI ratio and in vivo transduction efficiency showed
that heart repair is primarily induced by cardiac reprograming with
GMT but that Tβ4 co-treatment is the most effective. As expected,
the Tβ4-induced niche may promote neovascularization, as Tβ4
groups had higher capillary/vascular density, with more proliferating
cells. Lower caspase-3+ cell numbers in the GMT group may
be because of GMT-mediated cardiac reprogramming (attenuated fibrosis).
The percentage of cTnT+/GFP+ cells was used
in this study as a metric of the efficiency of transdifferentiation
to a more cardiac-like phenotype, but this metric is built on the
assumption that every GFP+ cell was equally transduced
by up to three separate AAV particles bearing different transgenes.
This assumption may be appropriate in regions close to the injection
site where the proportion of GFP+/total cells may approach
100%, but will break down with distance from the injection site as
the multiplicity of infection (moi) declines. In contrast to previous
reports using retroviral vectors,13 immunostains
for α-SA in the current study failed to detect the striations
characteristic of sarcomeres in GFP+ cells and none of
the GFP+/Actn2+ cells in this study resemble
the shape of elongated cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the functional consequence
of AAV-mediated GMT transduction remains to be studied. In all cases,
the co-treatment group showed the highest efficacy in both heart reprogramming
and regeneration.

In conclusion, AAV-mediated niches induced
by GMT and Tβ4
work successfully in terms of heart repair. This AAV-based synergism
can be easily achieved and has promise as the next therapeutic strategy
for cardiovascular disease in the near future.

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Reagents
Dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased
from Hyclone (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). pAAV-MCS, pAAV-GFP,
pAAV-DJ, and pAAV-Helper were obtained from Cell Biolab Inc. (San
Diego, CA). Anti-CD31, cTnT, and PCNA antibodies were obtained from
Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-caspase-3 and vimentin were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antisarcomeric α-actinin
was from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). AlexaFluor 488, 594, and 647
secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen (Warszawa, Poland). All
other reagents and chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased
from Sigma.

3.2 Cell Culture
Human
embryonic kidney-293T
cells were grown in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin
(100 U/mL), and streptomycin (10 μg/mL). Cells were kept under
standard conditions: 37 °C, 5% CO2, and humidified
atmosphere. Primary MEFs were isolated from BALB/C mouse embryos (12.5–13.5
days post-coitum).47 Primary MCFs were
isolated from 2 days to 3 weeks old C57BL/6 mice. Hearts were removed,
washed in cold PBS, chopped, and digested with collagen type-II solution,
as previously described.13 A single-cell
suspension was obtained by gentle trituration and passed through a
40 μm cell strainer (Nunc, Thermo Scientific Inc.). For primary
MCF culture, the excised mouse hearts were minced into small pieces
of less than 1 mm3, digested with 0.03 unit of Liberase
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and cultured for 10 days in F12/DMEM/15%
FBS media on gelatin-coated dishes. Migrated fibroblasts were harvested
and filtered with 40 μm cell strainers (BD Bioscience, San Jose,
CA) to avoid contamination with heart tissue fragments. After 4–24
h of infection, the medium was replaced with DMEM/M199/10% FBS medium
and changed every 2–3 days.

3.3 Quantitative
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
(qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was conducted using total RNA with the
SYBR Green Master Mix kit (Roche) and individual primer sets (Table S1) for Actc1 (actin, α cardiac muscle
1), Myh6 (cardiac muscle myosin; myosin heavy chain 6), Ryr2 (ryanodine
receptor 2), Gja1 (connexin 43; gap junction α1-protein), cTnT
(cardiac Troponin T), Col1a2 (collagen 1a2), and BAT (β-actin)
by using a LightCycler 96 machine (Roche). mRNA levels were normalized
to BAT.

3.4 Construction of Chimeric AAV
The
pAAV plasmids containing GFP, Gata4, Mef2c, Tbx5, or Tβ4 were
constructed using multicloning sites and standard protocols. The pAAV
vectors, along with pAAV-DJ and pAAV-Helper, were transfected into
293T cells using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) to generate functional
cAAVs. Cells were harvested and lysed by freeze-thaw cycling after
72 h.

3.5 AAV Purification and Genome Copy Number Determination
AAVs were purified using an AAV purification kit (Cell Biolab).
The AAV genome copy number was determined using the SYBR Green Master
Mix kit (Roche) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in a LightCycler 96 Real-Time
PCR machine (Roche). The same sets of primers that were used for AAV
titer determination were used for quantifying AAV genome copy (gc)
numbers.

3.6 LAD Ligation and In Vivo AAV Administration
Five mice per group were subjected to MI by ligation of the LAD
coronary artery, as described previously.48 Immediately after LAD ligation, each group of mice received an intramyocardial
injection of AAV-transgene (1 × 109 genome copies)
in a total volume of 30 μL at three different border sites of
ligated area. The mice were euthanized at 28 days post-MI, and structural
assessment of their hearts was performed. All five mice from each
group were included in the final tissue analysis by immunohistochemistry.

3.7 Immunohistochemistry
The excised
hearts of the sacrificed mice were retrogradely perfused with PBS
to wash the coronary vasculature and LV and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight at 4 °C. Each tissue sample was embedded in paraffin.
Sections (2 μm) stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson’s
trichrome were used to calculate fibrosis size and wall thickness
using Image Pro version 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). The
sections were subjected to immunofluorescence staining using standard
protocols. Primary antibodies against GFP (abcam ab13970), cTnT, Vimentin
(BD Bioscience BD550513), CD31 (abcam ab28364), collagen type I (abcam
ab21286), and αSA (Sigma A2172) were used to investigate AAV
transduction (GFP), fibroblasts (Vimentin), vascular regions (CD31),
fibrosis (COI), or cardiogenic regions (cTnT or αSA). Primary
antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Abcam)
and Caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for examining proliferation
and cell death in ischemic tissues. Sections were counterstained with
DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined using a FluoView
1000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

3.8 Quantitative Morphometry
Histological
assessment was performed using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda). Infarct
area was recognized by Masson’s trichrome staining. Infarct
size was measured with a percentage of the left ventricular free wall
circumferential length and infarct wall thickness with a percentage
of the thickness of septal wall. GFP and cardiac protein expressing
cell numbers were counted with counterstaining with DAPI. Co-localized
regions of both protein expressions were determined by Image J software.
Five mice in each group were used to analyze the morphology. Two–three
numbers of microscope slides/mouse and three numbers of fields analyzed
per mouse were used to get the analyzed data. Images in border sites
of ligated area were taken.

3.9 Statistical Analyses
Data are presented
as mean ± SD (where appropriate) and were considered to differ
significantly if the p value was less than 0.05.
