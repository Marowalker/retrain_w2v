A series of complex boronic acids
were prepared through multicomponent
reactions (MCRs). Both Passerini and Ugi MCRs were carried out in
which one component was an arylboronic acid. The resulting highly
functionalized boronic acids participated efficiently in the Liebeskind–Srogl
cross-coupling reaction with meso-methylthioBODIPY
derivatives to yield complex borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes in
good yields. The joined spectroscopic and computational study points
out the deep impact of the arylated chromophoric position on the photophysical
signatures. Thus, unconstrained aryls grafted at the meso position
did not sway the spectral band positions but switched on new nonradiative
relaxation channels, whereas additional arylation at the opposite
α-pyrrolic position softened such fluorescence quenching and
shifted the emission to the red-edge of the visible spectrum. The
conducted biological analysis revealed that peripheral blood mononuclear
cells incubated with these new compounds showed reduced cytotoxicity
and retained their normal activities. Additionally, the dyes remained
stable inside the cells after 24 h of incubation. These results demonstrated
that these novel fluorescent probes based on BODIPY can be applied
for cell imaging and analysis, expanding their applications.

Introduction
Boronic acids are arguably
one of the most useful functional groups
in organic chemistry. Both academia and industry have greatly benefited
from their properties and applications.1 From the synthetic point of view, one of the most important transformations
where boronic acids participate is the formation of the C–C
bond. Thus, in this regard, we can mention the well-known Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction,2 the reductive
coupling with tosylhydrazones,3 the transition-metal-free
C–C bond formation,4 the Petasis
reaction,5 the Au-catalyzed intramolecular
aminoarylation of alkenes,6 the Pd- or
Rh-catalyzed conjugate addition to enones,7 and their Pd-catalyzed homocoupling.8 A relatively recent example of the efficient participation of boronic
acids in the formation of C–C bonds is their Pd-catalyzed,
Cu(I)-mediated reaction with thioorganics, that is, the so-called
Liebeskind–Srogl cross-coupling reaction (LSCC).9

Over the last few years, our research groups
have exploited the
commercial availability of both aryl- and heteroaryl-boronic acids
to prepare a large number of borondipyrromethene (BODIPY)-containing
fluorophores starting from Biellmann BODIPYs101 using the LSCC (Scheme 1).11 BODIPYs are
well-known fluorophores with very interesting optical properties and
varied applications.12

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Meso-Substituted
BODIPYs via the LSCC
Even though this methodology proved to be exceptionally
tolerant
to the functional groups present in the initial boronic acid (functional
groups, such as Cl, Br, I, CO2H, NH2, CH2OH, CH2Br, CH2N3, OH, and
SiMe3, were perfectly tolerated), complex boronic acids
remained to be tested. There are examples of the synthesis of boronic
acids of high complexity in the literature;13 however, all of them involve a series of iterative and rather elaborate
synthetic sequences for their preparation. Rather, we were interested
in a quick and flexible method that would render the final complex
boronic acid in, if possible, one step with a minimum purification
effort. Pan’s groups in 2014 provided the answer to this challenge.14 He and his co-workers carried out the Ugi15 reaction with 4-formylphenylboronic acid, a
carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isonitrile (eq 1) to yield an arylboronic acid with rich functionality. 1  

This multicomponent reaction (MCR) takes place
under very mild
conditions and the final products can be isolated simply by using
an acid/base treatment. We realized that this method would allow the
introduction of a great deal of diversity by changing the nature of
the carboxylic acids, amines, and isonitriles. Additionally, the starting
boronic acid moiety may be attached to an arylcarboxylic acid or an
aniline fragment as well. Even the possibility to have a boronic acid-containing
arylisonitrile became a reality after Pan’s report of the preparation
of isocyano aryl boronate esters.16 Herein,
we wish to disclose the synthesis of complex boronic acids building
upon Pan’s contribution and extend it to the Passerini reaction
using not only the boronic acid fragment in the benzaldehyde component
but also in the carboxylic acid and aniline partner of the MCRs. In
this context, seminal contributions have been made to the synthesis
of complex fluorophores using MCRs, including isocyanide-based processes
by Balakirev and Vendrell.17 The elaborate
arylboronic acids so prepared were used in the LSCC with the Biellmann
BODIPYs to obtain novel fluorophores with rich functionality. This
contribution is a proof of concept whereby we seek to demonstrate
the versatility of the synthetic methodology. We describe the photophysical
signatures of the final products, aided by computational calculations,
and biological properties, such as cell staining and time course inside
cell stability, cell toxicity, and intracellular localization by fluorescence
microscopy, as well.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Different
arylboronic acids analogues of
type 2 were synthesized through the Passerini three-component
reaction (P-3CR) between different (het)arylboronic acids (containing
either the formyl or the carboxy moiety), aldehydes, benzoic acid,
and t-butyl isocyanide in MeOH at room temperature
for 24 h. All desired products (2a–h) were obtained
in moderate to excellent crude yields ranging from 49 to 98% (Chart 1). See Supporting Information for details of the aq
basic washing needed to isolate the crude products that were directly
used for the LSCC.

a Crude yield after base extraction.
Conditions: aldehyde (1.0 equiv), acid (1.3 equiv), isonitrile (1.3
equiv), MeOH (1 M), and rt, 24 h.



In the reaction
set studied, the yields of the products 2a–h were
superior when the boronic acid fragment was attached to the
benzoic acid.

In a similar way, compounds of type 3 were synthesized
via the Ugi four-component reaction (U-4CR) starting from different
aldehydes, amines, benzoic acids, and t-butyl isocyanide.
The boronic acid fragment was connected to the aryl aldehyde, amine,
or benzoic acid in each case. As before, only aq washings were needed
to isolate the crude boronic acids to be used in the next reaction.
The results are shown in Chart 2.

b Aldehyde and amine were stirred for 15 min prior to the addition
of the isocyanide and the carboxylic acid.



The crude yields of the final products ranged from moderate to
excellent. The boronic acids thus synthesized (Charts 1 and 2) were used
in the LSCC with 8-methylthioBODIPY 1a to obtain new
meso-substituted BODIPY of type 4 (Chart 3). The desired products 4a–c, 4e–k, and 4n–o were obtained
in moderate to good yields ranging from 56 to 88%. On the other hand,
the reaction failed to yield products 4d, 4l, and 4m. In the case of products 4l and 4m, their terminal triple bond may have engaged in a Cu-promoted
side reaction because in the LSCC, there is an excess of CuTC. The
mechanistic reason why 4d was not obtained is not clear
to us at this point. The reaction times of the LSCC were typical for
this process (1–3 h).11a,11b Moreover, all of the
products were fully characterized by confirming the structure of boronic
acids 2a–h and 3a–g. Derivatives 4f and 4o have bromine atoms with which further
functionalization can take place via transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions. All new products shown in Chart 3 fluoresce in the green region of the visible
spectrum (vide infra). Being aware of the importance of preparing
dyes that absorb and emit in the red region of the visible spectrum
for biological applications,18 a few analogues
were prepared starting from our recently reported19 modified Biellmann BODIPY 1b (Chart 4).

Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol %), tri-2-furylphosphine
(TFP) (7.5 mol %), and THF (3 mL).

Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol %), TFP (7.5 mol %), and
THF (3 mL).



The reactivity of BODIPY 1b was observed to be slightly
lower than that of 1a. This resulted in somewhat longer
reaction times and moderate chemical yields of the final products.

Photophysical Properties
The spectral bands of the
meso-arylated compounds (4a–4c, 4e–4j and 4n–4o, see Chart 3) are located close to those of the corresponding unsubstituted dipyrrin
core,20 regardless of the substitution
pattern of the 8-phenyl ring (Table 1 and Figure S1). The twisting
of such a ring with regard to the BODIPY plane (52° for para-substituted 4a and 60° for meta-substituted 4c from
the ground-state-optimized geometries at the b3lyp/6-31+g* calculation
level) owing to the steric hindrance with the adjacent hydrogens avoids
resonant interaction with the dipyrrin backbone, supporting its scarce
effect on the spectral band positions and profiles. However, the exerted
geometrical strain is not high enough as to lock the phenyl in a fixed
conformation. Instead, the unconstrained meso-aryl group has the freedom
to rotate, enabling a fluorescence quenching pathway which has a deep
impact in the fluorescence parameters.21 As a result of such an enhancement of the nonradiative energy loss
via internal conversion relaxation, all of this set of compounds are
poorly fluorescent, with quantum yields lower than 0.06 (Table 1).

Indeed, the simulated energy
landscape for the 8-phenyl motion
provides a rotational barrier of 11.9 kcal/mol in the ground state,
which becomes even lower upon excitation (8.1 kcal/mol, Figure 1). Thus, in the excited state,
there are more energetically available conformations easily accessible
owing to the low rotational barrier, supporting the higher internal
conversion probability. Moreover, when the 8-phenyl group is disposed
more coplanar with the dipyrrin core, an electron coupling is feasible
and it leads to a deep distortion of the geometry of the chromophore
(puckering along the transverse axis with bending angles up to 40°, Figure 1). Indeed, it has
been theoretically proposed that after such an intramolecular interaction,
a low-lying “dark” state can be populated.22 The key role of the 8-aryl free motion is supported
by the slight improvement of the fluorescence response of those compounds
bearing meta-substituted 8-aryl groups (4c and 4o) with regard to their para-substituted counterparts (Table 1). The exerted faintly
higher steric hindrance upon functionalization at the former position
slightly hinders the nonradiative deactivation pathways associated
with the 8-aryl mobility.

Figure 1 Potential energy surface with regard to the
8-phenyl group rotation
in the ground and first excited state in THF. For the sake of simplicity
from a computational point of view, 8-phenylBODIPY was taken as the
model for the simulation.

This nonradiative deactivation is not the only ongoing quenching
process in this set of compounds. Indeed, those dyes bearing electron-withdrawing
moieties (such as carboxylates) directly linked to the meso-phenyl
fragment feature the lowest fluorescence efficiencies (see e.g., 4e–4h and 4n in Table 1, with nearly negligible emissions). Such
stronger fluorescence quenching can be assigned to the additional
activation of intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) processes. This
ICT is populated from the locally excited state and is not fluorescent
(or at least very weak) because no new emissions are recorded. The
fluorescence lifetimes reflect all of these complex dynamics in the
excited state (Table 1). Thus, the free motion of the para-substituted 8-aryl group (4a–4b and 4i–4j) induces a shortening
of the lifetime (being just hundreds of picoseconds, whereas in BODIPYs,
is usually in the nanosecond scale), in agreement with the recorded
low fluorescence quantum yields (Table 1). This trend is ascribed to the aforementioned increase
of the nonradiative pathways: on one hand, the enhanced internal conversion
probability by the free motion of the 8-phenyl and on the other hand,
the feasible population of a relaxed “dark” state upon
excitation owing to the electronic coupling between the phenyl and
the dipyrrin.22 Furthermore, in 4c and 4o, the lifetimes become longer (up to 800 ps)
upon meta-substitution of the 8-phenyl ring. Indeed, those dyes show
the highest, albeit still low, fluorescence efficiencies among this
set of compounds (Table 1). Further functionalization of the 8-aryl fragment with electron-withdrawing
moieties provides more complex decay curves. In fact, in dyes 4e–4h and 4n (bearing para-carboxylated
8-phenyl rings), an additional very fast second exponential (tens
of picoseconds, in the limit of the temporal resolution of our single-photon
counter) is required. Such a lifetime becomes the main component of
the decay curve and is assigned to the population of an ICT state,
which quenches almost entirely the fluorescence response (Table 1).

In a previous
work, we concluded that the attachment of a para-nitrophenyl
group at the 3-position was desirable to achieve improved fluorescence
response toward the red-edge of the visible spectrum.19 Therefore, we followed this strategy to boost the fluorescence
response in the herein developed dyes leading to the compounds shown
in Chart 4. As expected,
the feasible resonant interaction of such an aromatic arm with the
dipyrrin core leads to an extended π-system, which explains
the recorded bathochromic shift of the spectral bands, owing mainly
to a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital stabilization as suggested
by quantum mechanics simulations (Figures 2 and S2). Besides,
in all cases, the fluorescence efficiencies clearly increase with
regard to their respective non-nitrated counterparts (Table 2 vs 1). Indeed, the fluorescence decay curves are described as biexponentials
but with much longer lifetimes and a similar statistical weight of
both components (Table 2). Such a fluorescence enhancement was ascribed to the electron-withdrawing
ability of the 3-nitrophenyl group, which pulls electronic density
far away from the opposite meso position, thereby decreasing the negative
impact of the free motion of the 8-aryl fragment on the fluorescence
response.23 In fact, the electrostatic
potential maps show that the negative electronic charge is shared
between the fluorine atoms and the nitro group, whereas without such
a nitrophenyl moiety, the negative charge is mainly located just at
the fluorine atoms (see red regions in Figure 2 for 5a and 4a,
respectively).

spectra of 4a and its p-nitrophenyl
counterpart 5a in THF. The corresponding calculated molecular
orbitals involved in the electronic transition, as well as the electrostatic
potential mapped onto the electronic density (blue for positive and
red for negative charge), are also depicted.

and Nitro Compounds 5a–5d (See Chart 4) in THF (Top) and Acetonitrile

Nevertheless, an increase
of the solvent polarity clearly drops
the fluorescence efficiency and the lifetimes also become faster.
Besides, such a short-living component prevails in the decay curve
(Table 2). This trend
was unexpected and striking because no solvent sensitiveness of the
fluorescence response was recorded in previously reported related
asymmetrically nitro compounds (just differing in the steric hindrance
exerted around the 8-aryl, ortho-substituted).20 Therefore, in such nitrated BODIPYs with constrained 8-aryl,
an ICT is not viable, whereas in the herein tested compounds 5a–5d (with unconstrained 8-aryl), the strong electron-withdrawing
nitro moiety may be able to induce ICT processes. Recently, advanced
calculations in BODIPYs bearing unconstrained meso-aryls have revealed
that ICT processes can be involved in the ongoing fluorescence quenching
mechanism induced by such phenyl. Indeed, upon excitation, a partial
charge transfer takes place from the side pyrroles to the central
six-membered ring of the dipyrrin skeleton (Figure 2). The presence of unsaturated bonds at the
meso-position able to couple with the BODIPY upon excitation (unconstrained
vinyl or phenyl) seems to favor ICT processes.24 Following this line of reasoning, the 3-nitrophenyl moiety
in for dyes 5a–5d could strengthen such charge
separation, enabling and stabilizing ICT processes mainly in polar
media. Moreover, the lowest fluorescence quantum yields and lifetimes
in this set of compounds are recorded for 5b and 5d, those bearing electron-withdrawing groups (meta-fluorine
and para-carboxylate, respectively) directly linked to the 8-phenyl
(Table 2). Likely,
such a functionalization increases the charge separation and enhances
the deleterious effect of the ICT in the fluorescence response of
these nitrated BODIPYs.

Biological Assays
To assess the
possible application
of the compounds generated in the present study for biological applications
such as specific cell compartment staining, we tested the fluorescence
of whole cells stained with all compounds synthesized. This screening
allowed us to eliminate compounds that did not render fluorescent
cells. First, using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),25 we incubated the selected compounds for 2 h
and analyzed the cells by flow cytometry, recording the fluorescence
emitted in different channels (fluorescence wavelengths). This strategy
enabled us to discriminate compounds that were nonfluorescent inside
the cells or exhibited a negative effect on the cell morphology, suggesting
toxicity.

In Figure 3, we show the analysis of three compounds that showed the
expected fluorescence pattern. The compounds were analyzed for fluorescence
at all wavelengths available in a Beckman Coulter MoFlo high-speed
cell sorter. We identified that cells retained the fluorescence up
to 24 h after exposure (histogram analysis), while retaining almost
95% and up in all cases, the cell morphology (smoothed dot plots).
Also, the PBMC samples contained not only mononuclear cells but also
some granulocyte cells, which were also stained showing the same stability
in the time course tested (Figure 3). These results suggested that the compounds generated
are incorporated rapidly into the cells, except for compound 4n, which needed 2 h to be fully incorporated into the cells.
Therefore, these data confirmed the ability of the compounds to stain
all cell subpopulations present in the samples.

Figure 3 Flow cytometry analysis
of human PBMCs stained and incubated in
the presence of compounds 4j, 4h, and 4n. Human PBMCs were obtained from healthy volunteers, following
the institutional ethics guidelines. Cells were isolated as described
previously,26 and cell staining was performed
in 24-well plates containing 1 × 106 PBMCs per well.

In the time course analysis, the
synthesized BODIPYs showed intracellular
fluorescence stability and cells also did not show death or apoptosis
in the period tested. After analysis for 24 h, cells showed stability
and fluorescence remained stable, compound 4n showed
slow incorporation rate when compared with compounds 4j and 4h (Figure 3), and cells did not show indications of damage by means of
losing cell shape (both size and complexity) as depicted in Figure 3, where plotted cells
size versus cell complexity remains intact. We included dimethyl sulfoxide-treated
cells to show that the solubilization agent used did not damage the
cells.

Cell samples were stained with compounds 4h, 4j, and 4n and analyzed by fluorescent
microscopy.
The three compounds showed green fluorescence inside the cells: compounds 4h and 4n heterogeneously stained the PBMCs,
being accumulated in patch-like structures inside the cells, whereas
compound 4j clearly accumulated in the cytoplasm (Figure 4). Both 4j and 4n tended to aggregate inside cells, generating
a yellowish fluorescence, also observed as the formation of small
aggregates in the culture media (Figure 4). Interestingly, the three compounds were
also capable of staining platelets (small dotlike structures, Figure 4).

Figure 4 Human PBMCs inspected
under fluorescent microscopy. Aliquots containing
5 × 106 human PBMCs were incubated with 20 μg
of each compound and inspected under a fluorescent microscope as reported.26 The scale bars represent 10 μm.

Next, we addressed the cell cytotoxicity
of compounds 4h, 4j, and 4n by measuring the release of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), measured with a commercial kit from Thermo
Scientific and as described before.26 Time-course
interactions showed that compound 4h was not toxic to
cells, even after 24 h of incubation (data not shown). Compounds 4j and 4n did not display cytotoxicity at short
incubation times, but compound 4j showed that 62 ±
3% of cell population displayed cytotoxicity after 6 h of incubation
and 100% cytotoxicity after 24 h of incubation. Interaction with compound 4n was cytotoxic only at long incubation times (24 h), where
100% of cytotoxicity was observed. This observation is in contrast
with the data from flow cytometry analysis, suggesting that cell integrity
is not fully compromised but partial cell lysis or metabolic interference
occurs with compounds 4j after 6 h and 4n after 24 h.

Finally, we tested whether any of these three
compounds could activate
the ability of human PBMCs to produce TNFα and IL-10, the two
gold standards of a pro- and anti-inflammatory response, respectively.27 Because of the toxicity seen in the compounds
tested, we analyzed the effect on cells after 6 h of incubation to
minimize the long-term effect seen in longer incubations. Results
presented in Figure 5 indicate that incubation for 6 h with 20 μg of each compound
did not activate the immune cells, indicating that functional integrity
is preserved in PBMCs in the presence of compounds 4h, 4j, and 4n. Moreover, when human PBMCs
were preincubated for 6 h with 20 μg of each compound and then
challenged with heat-killed 5 × 105Candida parapsilosis yeast cells, production of both
cytokines was not affected by any of the three compounds tested (Figure 5). Therefore, cell
functionality is preserved when human PBMCs interact with 4h, 4j, or 4n compounds in the time tested
and does not activate an inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response
by themselves.

Figure 5 TNFα and IL-10 production by human PBMCs. Human
cells were
incubated for 6 h with 20 μg 4h, 4j, or 4n and then supernatants were stored and used to
quantify cytokines by ELISA. Alternatively, human PBMCs were preincubated
for 6h with the compounds, before being challenged with heat-killed
5 × 105C. parapsilosis yeast cells. Mock reactions showed threshold levels of cytokines,
whereas the C. parapsilosis–human
PBMC interaction stimulated known levels of both cytokines.

Second, we analyzed the new meso-substituted
BODIPYs from the Biellmann
BODIPY with the red fluorescence profile in the interaction with human-derived
PBMCs. Several compounds were analyzed by flow cytometry and only
two compounds, 5a and 5d, showed the predicted
fluorescence pattern between 616 and 670 nm. In Figure 6, human PBMCs stained with compounds 5a and 5d for 24 h were analyzed by flow cytometry,
showing a clear increase in the fluorescence in the red spectrum relative
to the unstained cells. Histograms shown in red correspond to the
unstained cells and the histograms shown in blue and dark yellow correspond
to the duplicate samples for the tested compounds. The fluorescence
emission by compound 5d also showed a diminished emission
at 616 nm, whereas compound 5a showed a specific emission
at 670 nm. Cell morphology showed integrity as shown in the insets
of Figure 6. Also,
fluorescence microscopy was used to analyze these compounds to assess
their intracellular localization (Figure 4). Compound 5a stained cells
in yellow, whereas compound 5d labeled cells with a red
fluorescence. Both compounds homogeneously stained the whole cells,
including the small dots that are platelets (Figure 4). With these results, the compounds generated
can be applied in a wider range of cell staining, achieving wavelengths
that are useful for cell imaging and analysis.

recording green (529 nm), orange (616 nm),
and red (670 nm) fluorescence of PBMCs stained with compounds 5a and 5d. Same analysis was performed as in Figure 3. Cells showed no
signs of damage due to the exposure to the compounds tested (data
not shown).

Conclusions
Arylboronic
acids participate in MCRs to give highly decorated
products. The Passerini and Ugi MCRs were used to prepare 15 novel
boronic acids with rich functionality. These boronic acids reacted
with 8-methylthioBODIPY derivatives to produce 16 novel, highly functionalized
BODIPY dyes in a straightforward manner.

The impact of the arylation
on the photophysical signatures markedly
depends on its attachment position in the dipyrrin backbone. On the
one hand, the unconstrained meso-aryl, bearing the complex functionalization
of the boronic acid, did not interact by resonance with the BODIPY
core but enhanced the nonradiative relaxations related with its free
motion, as probed by the different extent of the fluorescence quenching
depending on para or meta substitution. As a result, low fluorescence
efficiencies are attained in these meso-arylated BODIPYs. On the other
hand, additional unconstrained nitrated aryl groups at the α-pyrrolic
position enabled an electron coupling and their electron-withdrawing
ability counteracted in part, such as nonradiative channels, leading
to a higher fluorescence response toward the red-edge of the visible
spectrum, albeit somehow limited owing to the activation of charge-transfer
phenomena in polar surrounding environments.

The cell staining
analysis clearly showed that the BODIPYs generated
in this work are compatible with cells showing high enough fluorescence
to be tracked by bioimaging and whole-cell staining, along with retention
of cell functionality and reduced cell damage or toxicity in short
incubation times. Our results are encouraging for cell imaging and
for cellular structure staining for both basic and applied research.
Other MCRs to produce complex boronic acids and their cross-couplings
with different chromophores are being evaluated in our laboratories
and the results will be reported in due course. As a matter of fact
and regarding to BODIPYs, a valid approach could be to develop such
complex dyes but sterically hindered around the key meso position
(both via functionalization at the ortho position of arylboronic acids
or upon alkylation at the adjacent chromophoric 1 and 7 positions)
because they are expected to be brighter fluorophores.

Starting 8-(methylthio)BODIPY, CuTC, and
boronic acids are commercially available. Solvents were dried and
distilled before use.

Spectroscopic Techniques
Diluted
dye solutions (around
4 × 10–6 M) were prepared by adding the corresponding
solvent (spectroscopic grade) to the residue from the adequate amount
of a concentrated stock solution in acetone, after vacuum evaporation
of this solvent. UV–vis absorption and steady-state fluorescence
spectra were obtained using 1 cm path length quartz cuvettes. The
emission spectra were corrected from the monochromator wavelength
dependence, the lamp profile, and the photomultiplier sensitivity.
Fluorescence quantum yields (ϕ) were calculated using commercial
BODIPYs as the reference: PM546 (ϕr = 0.85 in ethanol)
for compounds 4a–4c, 4e–4j, and 4n–4o and PM597 (ϕr =
0.43 in ethanol) for compounds 5a–5d. The values
were corrected by the refractive index of the solvent. Radiative decay
curves were registered with the time-correlated single-photon counting
technique using the same spectrofluorimeter (with picosecond time-resolution).
Fluorescence emission was monitored at the maximum emission wavelength
after excitation by means of a pulsed Fianium Supercontinuum laser
at an appropriate wavelength for each compound, with 150 ps full width
at half-maximum pulses and working at 10 MHz. The fluorescence lifetime
(τ) was obtained after the deconvolution of the instrumental
response signal from the recorded decay curves by means of an iterative
method. The goodness of the exponential fit was controlled by statistical
parameters (χ-square) and the analysis of the residuals.

Theoretical
Simulations
Ground-state geometries were
optimized at the density functional theory level using the B3LYP hybrid
functional, whereas the first singlet excited-state optimization was
carried out by the configuration interaction singles method. In all
cases, the double-valence basis set adding a polarization function
(6-31+g*) was used. The energy minimization was conducted without
any geometrical restriction and the geometries were considered as
energy minimum when the corresponding frequency analysis did not give
any negative value. Rotational energy barriers, in both the ground
and excited states, were calculated from the potential energy surface,
which was simulated by relaxed scans (steps of 10°) of the 8-phenyl
twist with regard to the plane of the BODIPY core. For such an energy
landscape, the simpler 8-phenylBODIPY was considered as the model
because the fragment at para position of such a ring should not alter
the rotational barrier but greatly increase the computational cost,
resources, and time of the calculation. The solvent effect [tetrahydrofuran
(THF)] was also simulated during the above calculations by the self-consistent
reaction field using the polarizable continuum model. All theoretical
calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 implemented in
the computational cluster provided by the SGIker resources of the
UPV/EHU.

Synthesis and Characterization
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in deuteriochloroform (CDCl3), with either tetramethylsilane (0.00 ppm 1H,
0.00 ppm 13C) or chloroform (7.26 ppm 1H, 77.00
ppm 13C). Data are reported in the following order: chemical
shift in ppm, multiplicities [br (broadened), s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), exch (exchangeable), app
(apparent)], coupling constants, J (Hz), and integration.
Infrared spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer.
Peaks are reported (cm–1) with the following relative
intensities: s (strong, 67–100%), m (medium, 40–67%),
and w (weak, 20–40%). Melting points are not corrected. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was conducted in silica gel on TLC Al foils.
Detection was done by UV light (254 or 365 nm). High-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) samples were ionized by ESI+ and recorded via
the time-of-flight method.

Biological Methods
Human PBMCs were
isolated by density
centrifugation using Histopaque-1077 as described.26 Interaction with BODIPYs was performed in 24 well plates
containing 5 × 106 cells per well. The interactions
were incubated at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 for the
indicated times. After incubation, cells were collected from the wells
by cooling them and washing them twice with cold phosphate-buffered
saline buffer. Flow cytometry was performed in a MoFlo XDP system
collecting 50 000 singlet events and then gated for the total
PBMCs. Fluorescence was recovered from the compensated FL1 (green),
FL2 (yellow), and FL3 (red) channels using PBMCs without any labeling.
Also, we performed a screening using all photomultiplier tubes available
in the flow cytometer to analyze secondary signals for each BODIPY
without observing secondary emissions while interacting with PBMCs.

Microscopy
Human PBMCs were incubated with the BODIPYs
as indicated above and samples were examined by fluorescence microscopy
using a microscope and an MRc camera. Using PBMCs, immune response
was measured as described previously.26 Briefly, 100 μL of cells was adjusted to 5 × 105 PBMCs in RPMI 1640 Dutch modification (added with 2 mM glutamine,
0.1 mM pyruvate, and 0.05 mg/mL gentamycin; all reagents from Sigma)
and 100 μL with 1 × 105 fungal cells freshly
harvested or treated. The interactions were incubated for 24 h at
37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2. The concentrations of TNFα
and IL-10 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
according to the manufacturer instructions.

Upon human PBMC–BOIPY
interaction, cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the release of
LDH, using a commercial kit and following the manufacturer instructions.

Typical
Procedure for the Synthesis of Arylboronic Acid Analogues
via the Passerini and/or Ugi MCRs (TP1)
For the Passerini MCR
In a round-bottomed flask equipped
with a stir bar, the aldehyde (1.0 equiv), acid component (1.3 equiv),
and methanol (1.0 M) were first stirred for 5 min at room temperature. t-Butylisocyanide (1.3 equiv) was then added to the reaction
mixture. After TLC showed that the reaction went to completion, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude material was
redissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) and the resulting organic solution
was then washed with a saturated aq NaHCO3 solution combined
with brine (3 × 20 mL). The resulting organic layers were collected,
dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to
afford the desired product as a white solid. This solid was triturated
in petroleum ether and the residual solvent was removed in vacuo and
used directly in the following reaction.

For the Ugi MCR
In a round-bottomed flask equipped
with a stir bar, the aldehyde (1.0 equiv), amine (1.3 equiv), and
methanol (1.0 M) were first stirred for 15 min at room temperature.
The acid component (1.3 equiv) and t-butylisocyanide
(1.3 equiv) were then added to the reaction mixture. After TLC showed
that the reaction went to completion, the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure. The crude material was redissolved in dichloromethane
(20 mL) and the resulting organic solution was then washed with 1.0
M HCl(aq) (3 × 20 mL) and a saturated aq NaHCO3 solution
combined with brine (3 × 20 mL). The resulting organic layers
were collected, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and then concentrated
in vacuo to afford the desired product as a white solid. This solid
was triturated in petroleum ether and the residual solvent was removed

Typical
Procedure for the Cross-Coupling of 8-MethylthioBODIPYs
with Boronic Acids (TP2)
An oven-dry Schlenk tube, equipped
with a stir bar, was charged with either 8-methylthioBODIPY 1a or 1b (1.0 equiv), the corresponding boronic
acid (3.0 equiv), and dry THF (0.03 M) under N2. The mixture
was sparged with N2 for 5 min, whereupon Pd2(dba)3 (2.5 mol %), trifurylphosphine (7.5 mol %), and
CuTC (3.0 equiv) were added under N2. The reaction mixture
was immersed into a preheated oil bath at 55 °C. After TLC showed
that the reaction went to completion, the reaction mixture was allowed
to reach room temperature and adsorbed on SiO2 gel. After
flash chromatography (SiO2-gel, EtOAc/hexanes gradient)
purification, meso-substituted BODIPYs were obtained as highly colored
solids.
