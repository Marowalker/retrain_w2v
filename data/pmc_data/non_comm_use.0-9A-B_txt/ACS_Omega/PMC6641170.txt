The
development of the site-selective Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling
of dibromoanthracene as an efficient strategy toward organic light
emitting diodes (OLEDs) is disclosed in this article. An unprecedented
step-economic palladacycle-promoted triple Suzuki coupling protocol
allowed the synthesis of three new OLED emitters and could prove to
be a useful general strategy for researchers working in this field.
Characterization of the synthesized molecules by UV–vis spectroscopy
and thermogravimetric analysis–differential scanning calorimetry
followed by density functional theory studies of the different properties
strongly confirms the derivatives possess more significant hole mobility
character than electron transfer capability.

1 Introduction
Transition-metal
catalyzed reactions have in recent decades emerged
as an efficient method for the installation of C–C bonds in
a wide variety of substrates. Their applications range from synthesizing
simple biaryls to complex natural products and functional molecules
such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).1 Amongst others, palladium has played a special role in revolutionizing
the way catalytic reactions have been performed in the past few decades.
Excellent functional group tolerance, milder reaction conditions,
and the ability to activate a wide range of bonds are some of the
key features that have made palladium an indispensable tool in synthesis.2 The unparalleled success enjoyed by palladium-based
chemistry might be credited to the rapid development of ligands such
as phosphines and N-heterocyclic carbenes capable
of enriching palladium’s power to insert into the most difficult
of bonds.3 Although, this approach has
in many cases suffered from low catalyst stability and poor selectivity.

Palladacycles or cyclopalladated complexes4 possessing Pd–C bonds have emerged as a possible solution
to these downsides due to their unique combination of increased thermal
stability and enhanced reactivity. With a subtle blend of electronic
properties and structural flexibility, palladacyclic complexes have
provided researchers with solutions to challenging synthetic problems
such as selectivity in catalytic processes. In recent years, the introduction
of strongly σ-bonded ligands as a part of the structural backbone
of palladacyclic complexes has contributed to the enhancement of nucleophilicity
leading to efficient insertion into a variety of rather inert bonds.
These qualities of palladacyclic complexes have proved especially
useful in catalyzing synthetic processes such as the selective reduction
of alkenes, alkynes, and/or nitroalkanes.5 However, the most noteworthy application comes in the form of their
utilization as catalysts in cross-coupling reactions for the installation
of C–C bonds in substrates of wide-ranging complexity.

In spite of all this success, the true potential of palladacyclic
complexes has yet to be realized and recent developments in this field
of research (with applications in anticancer studies,6 liquid crystalline material synthesis,7 and others) are a testament of their growing importance.8 One such area that has yet to experience the
impact of palladacycles is the development of functional material
synthesis (OLEDs, semiconductors, etc.). For the development of OLEDs9 and related molecules, palladium-catalysis has
played a major role with Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions
as the key step.10 This is commonly achieved
by the incorporation of organic molecules that can enhance the thermal
stability and lifetime of the fabricated OLEDs. The same is true for
the improvement of full-color displays with high red, blue, and green
electroluminescence.11

Besides the
common occurrence of substructures such as p-terphenyls,12 carbazoles,13 triphenylamines,14 etc. in OLED frameworks, anthracene,15 with its unique blend of properties, has attracted
the most attention.
To date, the catalytic processes employed for the incorporation of
the anthracenyl structural motif into the OLED framework involve several
low-yielding synthetic steps with tedious work-up procedures.15 Recently, our group has disclosed an efficient
route for obtaining differently substituted anthracenes using a novel N-heterocyclic carbene ligand system in combination with
Pd(OAc)2 via Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions.16 However, although the route provides easy access
to substituted anthracenes, the involvement of several synthetic and
purification steps needs to be addressed in order to develop a more
sustainable approach to such molecules.

With this in mind, herein
we report a largely improved synthetic
protocol for accessing differently substituted anthracenes with promising
thermal stability and photophysical properties. This was achieved
via the employment of palladacyclic complexes17 enabling the site-selective (preferential) Suzuki–Miyaura
arylation of dibromoanthracenes in a one-pot sequential manner. Notably,
a unique and unprecedented one-pot sequential triple Suzuki–Miyaura
arylation protocol was made possible allowing for the development
of potential OLEDs with greater structural complexity.

2 Results and Discussion
At the outset of our studies we investigated
the possibility of
the selective monoarylation of 9,10-dibromoanthracene using different
palladium catalyst systems (summarized in Table 1). Initially, the employment of general palladium(II)
precursors such as Pd(OAc)2 and PdCl2 showed
poor reactivity and selectivity toward monoarylation (entries 1 and
2, Table 1). The commonly
applicable Pd(0) source, Pd(PPh3)4, brought
about a slight improvement in the overall conversion but provided
poor selectivity (entry 3, Table 1). In situ generated Pd(II) species via the addition
of commercially available σ-donor ligands such as 1,10-phenanthroline,
SIPr, and XPhos, provided similar results with a loss of selectivity
(entries 4–6, Table 1).18 To test the effect of complexed
XPhos Pd complexes on the catalytic process, XPhos PdG1 and XPhos
PdG2 were employed. Although improved reactivity was observed, the
selectivity was poor with the diarylated product obtained in higher
amounts than that of the monoarylated product (entries 7–9, Table 1).

We next turned our attention to the palladacyclic
complexes of
the formula [Pd(Phbz)(X)(PPh3)]17 (X = maleimide IA, OAc IB), which were
recently introduced by us as efficient catalysts for the homocoupling
of aryl boronic acids under aerobic conditions. It was observed that
subtle variation in the electronic properties (maleimide acting as
a better π-acceptor than OAc) led to a dramatic improvement
in the overall conversion as well as selectivity for the monoarylated
product (entries 7 and 8, Table 1). Palladacycle IA outperformed other
catalytic systems with an overall conversion of 100% and appreciable
selectivity for monoarylation. Catalyst loading experiments performed
on catalyst IA revealed that activity was retained even
at 0.5 mol % catalyst concentration and a slight improvement in selectivity
was observed. Any further reduction led to a reduction in reactivity.
Base screening was next undertaken with stronger bases such as KOH
showing better conversions but at the expense of selectivity. Similar
observations were made for other bases such as Et3N and
K3PO4. In the case of Cs2CO3, though, comparable reactivity and selectivity was achieved.

However, the more expensive nature of the base made the process
less attractive and therefore the use of K2CO3 with slightly better selectivity was chosen for further development.
To further enhance the selectivity toward monoarylation, varied temperature
studies were performed. At elevated temperatures, rapid conversion
to the product was followed by a loss in selectivity with both mono-
and diarylated products obtained in equal amounts. Optimum conditions
for monoselectivity were eventually made possible by a reduction in
reaction temperature to 60 °C. Any further reduction in temperature
led to less than satisfactory yields.

Having developed a selective
protocol for obtaining the monoarylated
anthracene, we decided to synthesize differently substituted anthracenes
allowing for further modification. Another reason for synthetic development
is related to the identification of potential candidates exhibiting
good emissive properties as starting points for obtaining OLED-type
molecules. The catalytic reactions were carried out at 60 °C
using the palladacycle IA in THF as solvent using 2 M
K2CO3 as the base employing different aryl boronic
acids. Electronic and steric effects play a major role in obtaining
the desired monoarylated products selectively with benzofuran-2-boronic
acid providing the best results.

The synthesized molecules were
further subjected to UV analysis
to determine their respective absorption wavelengths. Introduction
of different groups on the anthracenyl moiety brings about a bathochromic
shift (relative to the primary molecule, i.e., 9,10-dibromoanthracene)
in wavelength. A maximum in enhancement was observed when the benzofuran
moiety was installed on the anthracene substructure using the developed
protocol. Yet, a variety of other moieties also provided a decent
enhancement in absorbance values. The examples highlighted in Scheme 1 can thus serve as
indicators to the reader for further exploitation toward the quest
for the development of excellent OLED materials.

The synthesized products
were generally obtained as a crystalline
powder after column chromatographic purification and in one of the
cases (2c), it was even possible to obtain a single-crystal
X-ray structure;19 the crystal having been
grown from a dichloromethane/hexane solvent mixture (Figure 1). It was observed that the
torsion angle between the anthracene and the phenyl ring is 108.2°,
the angle between the phenyl and naphthalene ring is 82.7°, and
consequently the angle between anthracene and the naphthalene rings
is 25.6°. No coplanarity whatsoever was observed in the crystal
structure. As the three planar aromatic moieties are not coplanar,
it can be concluded that the molecule does not represent a fully delocalized
π-system in its crystalline form, but this may change in solution
or in its noncrystalline solid form. An activation of rotations around
the torsion angles by light, for instance, can be envisioned.

analysis. The ellipsoids are shown at the 50% probability level and

With the development of an efficient protocol permitting
the site-selective
arylation of dibromoanthracene, we turned our attention to the problem
that is commonly associated with the synthesis of OLED materials,
that is, sustainability of synthesis. Current routes for the synthesis
of OLED-type materials suffer from the usage of higher concentrations
of the metal catalyst and the necessity of several synthetic and purification
steps making the process commercially less attractive.20 With the aim of providing a sustainable solution
to this problem, we decided to explore the idea of performing the
selective arylation followed by a second arylation via a palladium-catalyzed
one-pot sequential21 protocol, which could
furnish differently substituted anthracenes of varying complexity.
This would provide researchers with a useful handle for fine-tuning
the electronic and fluorescence properties of the molecules through
judicious choice of the arylating groups.

Our earlier study
identified monoarylation using benzofuran-2-boronic
acid as particularly facile and also providing the highest absorbance
value compared to those of the others. It was therefore decided to
perform the first catalytic arylation in the one-pot sequence with
benzofuran-2-boronic acid as the coupling partner followed by the
introduction of other aryl boronic acids to furnish an array of diversely
substituted anthracenes (Schemes 2 and 3). From Scheme 2 it can be seen that in most
cases a good yield of the cross-coupled product was obtained over
two reaction steps without isolation of the monoarylated intermediates.

III: XPhos (1.0 mol %), 1.5 mmol of aryl boronic acid, K2CO3 (2.0 mmol), 80 °C, 12.0 h.

Isolated yield.

The employment
of electronically different aryl boronic acids resulted
in the formation of diarylated anthracenes exhibiting promising fluorescence
properties, as is evident from the absorbance wavelengths obtained
for the respective molecules (see Section 3.1). With the success of the one-pot sequential
double Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of 9,10-dibromoanthracene,
we envisaged a unique triple one-pot coupling process22 involving the employment of three different aryl boronic
acids as an efficient synthetic strategy to obtain OLED-type molecules
directly without isolation of any intermediates. The initial coupling
was performed with benzofuran-2-boronic acid, followed by the employment
of 4-chlorophenyl boronic acid, which provided us with a handle for
further modification. These two processes were catalyzed by the palladacyclic
complex IA. However, the next activation involving C–Cl
bond cleavage followed by coupling could only be achieved with the
incorporation of an electron-rich XPhos ligand into the catalytic
system.

Without the need for isolation of any of the intermediates,
synthesizing
OLED-type molecules could be made much easier by the employment of
such a step-economic methodology. It was also observed that in comparison
to the general methods employed for the synthesis of OLED-type molecules,
only a very low concentration of palladium catalyst was required.
Sustainability in catalytic processes leading to molecules of such
relevance could thus be achieved via these types of one-pot sequential
procedures.

3 Photophysical and Thermal Analysis
The above methodology provides a step-economic alternative to the
known synthetic procedures that involve tedious work-up procedures,
lower product formation, and multiple purification steps. During the
initial screenings a few of the synthesized molecules, namely 4a–c, were found to exhibit promising
UV absorbance in CH2Cl2 as solvent, thus warranting
further investigation into their photophysical and thermal properties.

3.1 Photophysical Properties
The unprecedented
triple Suzuki coupling protocol resulted in the formation of three
molecules comprising the anthracenyl substructure and extended conjugation.
The absorbance and emission spectra of 4a–c were recorded in CH2Cl2. For the emission
spectral analysis, the excitation wavelength was kept fixed at 400
nm. Substituting the anthracene structural motif in the 9,10 position
with different functionalities had a pronounced effect on the photophysical
properties of the resulting molecules (see Figure 2). This is evident from the shift in the
emission wavelengths well above 500 nm for 4a and 4c (564 and 503 nm, respectively).

Figure 2 (A) Absorbance spectra
for 4a–c; (B) emission spectra for 4a–c recorded
in CH2Cl2 at 25 °C. The concentration of
solutions was 1 × 10–6 M.

The solutions of the synthesized molecules (4a and 4c) in CHCl3, when analyzed under long
wavelength
UV light, exhibited green fluorescence whereas under normal conditions,
the solution appeared to be pale yellow, as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Solutions of 4a and 4c in CHCl3 with UV light switched off
and on, respectively.

3.2 Thermal Properties
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)22 are useful tools for analyzing the thermal stability
of compounds. In recent years, both analytical tools have been applied
to molecules with possible OLED applications because thermal stability,
naturally, is a prerequisite in this respect.

Consequently,
we first subjected the synthesized molecules 4a–c to TGA in the temperature range of 33–600 °C
under a N2 atmosphere by heating at a rate of 10 °C/min
(Figure 4). The anthracene-based
molecules 4a–c show high thermal
stabilities with decomposition temperatures (Td) ranging from 280 to 410 °C. Higher values of decomposition
temperatures observed for 4a–c could
be directly related to the extent of substitution on anthracene. The
intrinsically amorphous characteristics of the synthesized compounds
were further confirmed by DSC, which provided the individual melting
temperatures. For compounds 4a, 4b, and 4c, the melting temperature (Tm) was found to be 320, 230, and 280 °C, respectively. These
comparatively high values of Td and Tm are apparently due to the one extra phenyl
ring and larger molecular size of the synthesized molecules compared
to that of their disubstituted analogs (3a–f).

Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
4.1 Geometries
The effect of substituents
on the geometry of the anthracene core is already well documented.23−25 It has been shown that the dihedral angle between anthracene and
its substituents affects the extent of conjugation in the molecule
irrespective of the nature of the substituent. Selected geometrical
parameters of 4a, 4b, and 4c are given in Table 2 and the optimized geometries and labeling schemes of the models
are depicted in Figure 5. The dihedral angles between the anthracene core and its two substituents
for 4a are Φ1 = 58.7° and Φ2 = 89.2°
for the benzofuran and phenyl rings, respectively (Table 2). The increased dihedral angle
for the phenyl ring is due to the repulsion between its two ortho
hydrogens and anthracene whereas benzofuran only bears one ortho hydrogen.
Hence, the near perpendicularity between the anthracene moiety and
the phenyl ring prohibits an extended π-electron conjugation
retaining the individuality of each fragment.

The structural distinction of 4a, 4b,
and 4c, is based on the biphenyl, benzofuran, and triphenyl
amine moieties bound to the para position of the bridging phenyl ring.
These substituents have little effect on the dihedral angle between
the anthracene core and phenyl ring (85.4 and 79.5° for 4b and 4c, respectively) and nearly no effect
on the dihedral angle between benzofuran and the anthracene core (ranging
from 58.4 to 58.7°).

Major structural differences are,
however, evident in the dihedral
angle Φ3, that is, the angle between the bridging phenyl ring
and the varied para substituents distinct in each molecule (−36.9,
0.3, and −35.4° in 4a, 4b, and 4c, respectively).

The comparably small differences
in the dihedral angles Φ1
and Φ2 do not result in any significant changes in the conjugation
of the neutral geometry of the anthracene core. Here, the bond length
alternation (BLA) is almost zero in the central benzene ring whereas
in the remaining two benzene rings it is about 0.06 Å only. Interestingly,
the variance in BLA of the anthracene core is even reduced to about
0.03 Å in both the cation and anion geometries of 4a and 4b and to 0.04 and 0.03 Å for the cation and
anion of 4c, respectively, supporting a stronger conjugation
upon oxidation or reduction in these derivatives. Notably, the varied
substituents have only a negligible effect on the oxidized or reduced
geometries of all derivatives compared to those of each other.

4.2 Frontier Molecular Orbitals
From
the data summarized in Table 3, the electron density dependence on the substituent side
groups can be derived. The apparent structural near perpendicularity
of the substituent side groups with respect to the anthracene core
is well reflected by the appearance of the frontier molecular orbitals.
Derivatives 4a and 4b are quite similar
in their electronic density distribution in the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which
are localized predominately within the anthracene core. In contrast,
the strong donor triphenyl amine group of 4c contributes
very strongly to the HOMO whereas the LUMO is still centered at the
anthracene core. Hence, the LUMO levels are almost unperturbed at
−1.84, −1.87, and −1.82 eV, respectively, for 4a, 4b, and 4c. The predominance
of the triphenyl amine substituent in 4c results in a
HOMO level of −4.98 eV, whereas for 4a and 4b, it is located at about −5.2 eV. Thus, the HOMO–LUMO
gaps (HLGs) differ with 3.17 eV for 4c and about 3.3
eV for 4a and 4b. This can also be attributed
to the relatively smaller adiabatic electron affinity (EA) value of
5.86 eV for 4c, though the adiabatic ionization potential
(IP) values are not very different for all derivatives.

and Comparison of Experimental and Calculated Absorption Maxima (ΔE in eV) of 4a, 4b, and 4c
4.3 Absorption
and Reorganization Energies
For a deeper insight into the
electron transition character of all
of the derivatives, the excitation energies and reorganization energies
for hole and electron mobility were calculated (see Table 3). In general, a good agreement
between experimental and calculated excitation energies was found
within the accepted limit of 0.1 eV for time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT). The electronic excitation is strongly dominated by
the HOMO–LUMO transition for which the electron density distribution
was discussed in the previous section. A localized electron rearrangement
within the anthracene core is observed during transitions in 4a and 4b whereas a significant shift of electron
density from the triphenyl amine to the anthracene core was found
for 4c.

In addition, the electron/hole transport
parameters, namely the reorganization energies (λ+ and λ–), were calculated. From smaller reorganization
energies, greater charge mobilities can be anticipated. Notably, the
reorganization energies for hole mobility are always smaller than
those for electron mobility by 0.026, 0.055, and 0.105 eV for 4a, 4b, and 4c, respectively (Table 3). This increased
charge mobility can be attributed to the considerable geometrical
changes and HOMO levels in 4a, 4b, and 4c. All derivatives possess superior hole mobility than electron
transfer capability.

5 Conclusions
The
development of a unique synthetic methodology for obtaining
novel OLED-type emitters in a single-pot multistep procedure has been
achieved via a palladacycle-catalyzed triple Suzuki coupling protocol.
The procedure allows the synthesis of three new OLED-type emitters, 4a–c, that were found to exhibit interesting
photophysical properties. These molecules were characterized by different
characterization techniques, and molecule 4a exhibited
promising absorption and emission values. TGA of these molecules also
suggested high thermal stability, which will be useful for OLED applications.
Theoretical calculations (DFT) performed on these molecules provided
details on the geometry, HOMO–LUMO energies, as well as the
reorganization energies. On the basis of these findings, it could
be concluded that the hole mobility of the synthesized molecules 4a–c is far more superior than the electron
transfer, which makes these compounds excellent candidates for efficient
OLED emitters.

6 Experimental Section
6.1 General Remarks
All catalytic reactions
were conducted under an inert atmosphere of N2 on a Schlenk
line. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis was performed on aluminum
backed silica gel plates and compounds were visualized by UV light
(254 nm), phosphomolybdic acid solution (5% in EtOH), or 1% ninhydrin
in EtOH. Aryl boronic acids and other chemicals were obtained from
commercial sources and were used without further purification. Yields
refer to isolated compounds, estimated to be >95% pure as determined
by 1H NMR. NMR data (1H, 13C) were
recorded on a 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in
parts per million downfield from an internal tetramethylsilane reference.
Coupling constants (J values) are reported in hertz
(Hz). UV studies were performed in dichloromethane as solvent at a
concentration of 1 × 10–6 M.

6.1.1 X-ray Structural Analysis
A suitable
single crystal of 2c was mounted on a thin glass fiber
coated with paraffin oil. X-ray single-crystal structural data were
collected at low temperature (170 K) using a STOE IPDS 2T diffractometer
equipped with a normal-focus, 2.4 kW, sealed-tube X-ray source with
graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å).
The program X-Area was used for integration of the diffraction profiles;
numerical absorption correction was made with the programs X-shape
and X-red32; all from STOE 2010. The structure was solved by SHELXT-201426 and refined by full-matrix least-squares methods
using SHELXL-2013.27 The nonhydrogen atoms
were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were refined isotropically
on calculated positions using a riding model with their Uiso values
constrained to 1.2 Ueq of their pivot atoms. All calculations were
carried out using SHELX-201327 and the
WinGX GUI, ver2013.2.28 The crystallographic
data are summarized in Table 4.

6.2 Computational
Methodology
All calculations
in this study were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program.29 The ground state neutral optimized geometries
were obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Second order
analytical gradients were verified to assure the obtained geometries
were global minima on the respective potential energy surfaces. In
order to get a deeper insight into the absorption spectra, electronic
transitions were studied using TDDFT methodology at the same level
of theory. Upon ionization, the cationic and anionic geometries were
fully optimized at the UB3LYP/6-31G(d) level and the resulting geometries
were verified with all positive eigen values in the frequency calculation.
Using the ground state neutral and ionized geometries, the total reorganization
energies with respect to hole or electron transfer were calculated.
The reorganization energy for hole transport (λ+)
is the sum of the stabilization energies from losing an electron from
the cationic potential energy surface and upon regaining this electron
on a neutral potential energy surface. Similarly, electron transport
reorganization energy (λ–) is obtained with
respect to the addition of an electron and loosing this added electron
to/from anionic and neutral potential energy surfaces, respectively.
The IPs and EAs were also calculated by using cationic and anionic
optimized geometries, respectively.

6.6 Representative Procedure
for One-Pot Tandem
Triple Suzuki–Miyaura Arylation
A mixture of aryl
bromide (1.0 mmol) and catalyst (0.5 mol %) was placed in a Schlenk
tube containing 2 mL of dry THF and DI water (1:1) under a nitrogen
atmosphere and the resultant solution was stirred for 5–10
min. To this reaction mixture was added potassium carbonate (2.0 mmol)
and aryl boronic acid (1.5 mmol). The resultant mixture was then stirred
at 60 °C for 12 h. On completion of the reaction (confirmed by
TLC), a second aryl boronic acid (1.5 mmol) was added to the same
reaction solution followed by potassium carbonate (2.0 mmol). The
resultant reaction mass was stirred for 12 h at 80 °C. Once this
catalytic reaction was confirmed by TLC to proceed toward completion,
the reaction solution was cooled to r.t. XPhos ligand (2.38 mg, 0.5
mol %), along with the third aryl boronic acid (1.5 mmol), and potassium
carbonate (2.0 mmol) were added to the same reaction mixture and the
catalytic solution was stirred at 80 °C for 12 h. The reaction
mass was allowed to cool to r.t. and was extracted with dichloromethane,
dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated. The crude
solid thus obtained was further purified by column chromatography
using petrol ether.
