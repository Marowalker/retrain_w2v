Laser ablation in liquids (LAL) offers
a facile technique to develop
a large variety of surfactant-free nanomaterials with high purity.
However, due to the difficulty in the control of the particle synthesis
process, the as-prepared nanomaterials always have a broad size distribution
with a large polydispersity (σ). Surfactant-free properties
can also cause problems with particle growth, which further increases
the difficulty in size control of the colloids. Therefore, searching
for strategies to simultaneously unify the sizes of colloids and inhibit
particle growth has become significantly important for LAL-synthesized
nanomaterials to be extensively used for biological, catalytic, and
optical applications, in which fields particle size plays an important
role. In this work, we present a facile way to simultaneously realize
these two goals by ex situ SU-8 photoresist functionalization. Ag
nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by femtosecond laser ablation of silver
in acetone at laser powers of 300 and 600 mW were used as starting
materials. The synthesized Ag NPs have a broad size distribution between
1 and 200 nm with an average size of ca. 5.9 nm and σ of 127–207%.
After ex situ SU-8 functionalization and 6 months storage, most particles
larger than 10 nm become aggregates and precipitate, which makes the
size distribution narrow with an average diameter of 4–5 nm
and σ of 48–78%. The precipitation process is accompanied
by the decrease in colloid mass from the initial ∼0.2 to 0.10–0.11
mg after ex situ SU-8 functionalization and 6 months colloid storage.
Morphology analysis indicates that ex situ SU-8 functionalization
inhibits the particle growth into polygonal nanocrystals. Radical
polymerization of SU-8 on Ag NPs is considered to be the reason for
both spontaneous size separation and growth inhibition phenomena.
Benefiting from Ag NPs embedment and acetone dissolution, the glass-transition
temperature of SU-8 photoresist increased from 314 to 331 °C
according to thermogravimetric analysis. The universality of ex situ
SU-8 functionalization-induced growth inhibition and size separation
behaviors is further proved using the Au colloids generated by LAL
in acetone. This work is expected to provide a new route for better
size control of LAL-synthesized colloids via ex situ photoresist functionalization,
although a half of colloidal mass is wasted due to radical polymerization-induced
colloidal precipitation.

Introduction
In over last 2 decades, a newly emerged
nanoscience technique known
as laser ablation in liquids (LAL) has demonstrated its ability for
the convenient synthesis of a large variety of nanomaterials composed
of metallic, alloy, doped oxides, and particle–polymer composites.1−7 LAL is also possible to be implemented in the presence of an external
electric8,9 or magnetic field10,11 to produce nonspherical nanostructures.5 Downstream treatment, such as ex situ conjugation,3,12−14 enables researchers to construct particle–polymer
or particle–biomolecule composites, respectively. Currently,
the productivity of LAL has already reached 4 g/h,15,16 almost comparable to that of wet-chemistry methods. For a long-term
nanomaterial production, LAL becomes much cheaper than the wet-chemistry
technique17 so that industrial applications
of LAL-generated nanomaterials in the future are envisioned, which
is one of the main driving forces for the rapid expansion of LAL all
over the world in recent years.1

In the absence of surfactants during the fabrication procedure,
the as-prepared nanomaterials always possess high purity,1 which makes them very appealing for catalytic
and biological applications.2,18−20 On the other hand, high purity also means that the surfactant-free
particles suffer from spontaneous growth21 due to colloidal Brownian collision, which leads to their evolution
into different structures, such as nanocubes,22,23 nanowires,24,25 onion-structured spheres,26 nanofibers, and nanosheets.23 This issue further gives rise to the broad/bimodal size
distribution problem of LAL-synthesized colloids being closely related
to different mechanisms and the complex gas-phase/liquid-phase processes,
involving particle nucleation and growth.27,28

Two options, laser modulation and surface chemistry manipulation,
are available for size control of LAL-synthesized nanomaterials.1 The former strategy is mainly implemented by
changing laser parameters such as laser power,29 pulse duration,30 repetition
rate,31 and beam shape,32 fragmenting particles into smaller particles,33−35 or melting the particles into submicrospheres.36−38 The latter
strategy relies on either the conjugation of the particles by polymers3,39 or biomolecules40,41 or the inhibition of particle
growth by salts,42,43 surfactants,44,45 or carbon clusters while implementing LAL in organic solvents.46 As easily deduced, even though the particle
sizes are tailored, the particles obtained by laser modulation are
still surfactant-free, which inevitably induces particle growth. For
example, we have recently observed that ultrasmall Ag nanoparticles
(NPs) grow into polygonal nanocrystals accompanied by an increase
in the particle size during storage of the colloid for 6 months.47 Therefore, tailoring the colloidal surface chemistry
by ex situ functionalization would be a better solution to accurately
control the particle size. However, some problems still arise when
adopting this strategy. For example, Dell’Aglio et al. observed
the rapid colloidal aggregation after ex situ conjugation of ubiquitin
on bare Ag NPs, which led to an obvious red shift of the colloidal
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band and a decrease in the SPR intensity.48 A similar trend was observed by Meneghetti’s
group when they performed ex situ functionalization of Ag NPs with
α-lipoic acid and dodecanethiol molecules.49 Therefore, finding a suitable carrier that can not only
inhibit particle growth without strong colloidal aggregation but also
can bring new functions to the particles is of great importance. In
this regard, photoresists that can be used to construct three-dimensional
(3D) functional structures and films50,51 are considered
as good candidates for a thorough investigation. Barcikowski’s
group introduced LAL-synthesized Ni–Fe nanoparticles in SU-8
to linearly align the magnetic particles with the aid of an external
magnetic field.52 Jonušauskas et
al. embedded LAL-synthesized Au particles inside a negative photoresist
(zirconium/silicon hybrid sol–gel SZ2080) and implemented the
Au NPs plasmon-assisted three-dimensional (3D) microstructuring.53 Although SZ2080 could increase the stability
of Au NPs in isopropanol for months,53 the
issues regarding how the fresh surfactant-free LAL-generated colloids
behave in the presence of photoresist polymers, whether colloidal
aggregation occurs, the extent to which the colloids become aggregated
after ex situ polymer functionalization, and whether the aggregated
colloids stay inside the liquids or precipitate over time, are still
seldom studied. All of these issues should be clarified to establish
a steady foundation for the controllable 3D printing of particle–photoresist
nanocomposites.

In this work, Ag particles freshly synthesized
by femtosecond LAL
in acetone at laser powers of 300 and 600 mW for 60 min were used
as the starting materials. We demonstrate that ex situ photoresist
SU-8 functionalization does not only spontaneously narrow the colloidal
size distribution due to the precipitation of large particle aggregates,
but also inhibits particle growth into polygonal crystals. The variation
in the absorbance of the ex situ functionalized Ag–SU-8 composite
colloids was recorded using a UV–vis spectrometer. Particle
size analysis based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation
of the fresh Ag colloids and 6 months-aged SU-8-functionalized Ag
colloids provided evidences of both the size separation and growth
inhibition phenomena. Analysis of the Ag NPs surface chemistry and
the surface groups of SU-8-functionalized Ag NPs by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
measurements was performed to clarify the chemical bonding between
SU-8 and Ag particles. Differential scanning calorimetry–thermogravimetric
analysis (DSC–TGA) was implemented to evaluate how acetone
dissolution and embedded Ag NPs alter the thermal properties of the
SU-8 photoresist polymer.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a–d
shows the change in absorbance of the ex situ SU-8-functionalized
Ag NPs within 32 h and after storage for 6 months. As the aging time
increases, the SPR peak first red-shifts from 404 to 410 nm after
32 h colloidal storage and further red-shifts to 422 nm after storage
of both colloids for 6 months. A difference was observed for different
laser powers in that the SPR intensity of SU-8-functionalized Ag NPs
changed with time. For the composite colloid produced by 300 mW LAL,
the SPR peak intensity was almost unchanged within 32 h (Figure 1a), but was significantly
decreased from 3.5 to 2.0 (au) after 6 months of storage (Figure 1c,d) due to the slow
precipitation of Ag NPs. In contrast, the SPR intensity for 600 mW
LAL quickly decreased from 3.5 to 3.2 after storage for 32 h and then
further decreased to 1.3 after storage for 6 months, which indicates
the rapid precipitation of Ag NPs. The initial masses of the Ag colloids
in both cases were ca. 0.20 mg. After storage for 6 months, the residual
masses of Ag colloids inside the liquids changed to 0.11 and 0.10
mg for 300 and 600 mW LAL colloids, suggesting almost a half of Ag
colloids in weight precipitated over time. The inset of Figure 1c shows the photographs of
the composite colloids stored for 6 months. Despite almost the same
initial SPR peak intensity corresponding to the same initial Ag NP
concentration (Figure 1a), the SU-8-functionalized Ag colloids prepared by 300 and 600 mW
LAL were orange and yellow after storage for 6 months, respectively,
indicating a lower concentration of Ag NPs in the liquid for the latter
case, in accordance with the SPR intensity difference shown in Figure 1d. At the bottom
of the colloidal container, the precipitated particles (Figure 1c, black arrows) were clearly
evident, as expected.

NPs using

then stored for various times. Spectra of samples prepared at laser
powers of (a) 300 mW and (b) 600 mW and stored within 32 h (insets:
enlarged spectra in the wavelength range of 360–500 nm for
the samples stored for 0 and 32 h). (c) Spectra of samples prepared

range of 360–500 nm. The black colloids marked by “black
arrows” in (c) indicate colloidal precipitation.

Figures 2a–c
and 3a–c show the TEM images and the
size distributions of the fresh Ag NPs synthesized by LAL at laser
powers of 300 and 600 mW, respectively. The overall average sizes
of the fresh 300 and 600 mW LAL–Ag NPs were 5.93 ± 7.55
nm (polydispersity (σ) = 126.7%) and 5.88 ± 12.18 nm (σ
= 207.1%). Similarly to most of other LAL results,1 the Ag colloids synthesized in this work have a broad size
distribution with size variation from 1 nm to several hundred nanometers.
LAL at higher laser power has higher NP productivity;47 therefore, a larger amount of both large and small particles
with diameter lower and higher than 10 nm (Figures 2a vs 3a) are generated
by 600 mW LAL, and the average size of the 600 mW LAL–Ag colloid
is slightly smaller than that of the 300 mW LAL colloid. Such a broad
size distribution will cause a severe problem for colloidal applications
such as catalysis2 because of the difficulty
in clarifying the size effect.

Figure 2 TEM images and size distributions of the
fresh 300 mW LAL–Ag
colloids (a–c, g) which was synthesized by LAL of Ag at a laser
power of 300 mW and ex situ SU-8-functionalized Ag colloid (d–f,
h) after storage for 6 months, respectively.

Figure 3 TEM images and size distributions of the fresh 600 mW LAL–Ag
colloids (a–c, g) which was synthesized by LAL of Ag at a laser
power of 600 mW and ex situ SU-8-functionalized Ag colloid (d–f,
h) after storage for 6 months, respectively.

In our cases, small particles of 1–10 nm in diameter
occupy
88 and 91% number frequency of the entire amount for 300 and 600 mW,
respectively. A detailed analysis of the particle sizes in the range
of 0–10 nm shows that the colloids are mainly composed of Ag
clusters of ca. 2 nm in diameter (insets of Figures 2g and 3g) with average
sizes of 3.89 ± 1.98 nm (σ = 50.9%) and 3.69 ± 1.88
nm (σ = 50.9%) for 300 and 60 mW, respectively, which are almost
of the same size as that of metallic colloids obtained by laser fragmentation
in liquids.24 Therefore, as deduced from
our experimental results, long-period femtosecond LAL in organic solvents
is an attractive method to synthesize small metallic particles, as
also indicated in ref (21).

The UV–vis spectra and photographs of the ex situ
SU-8-functionalized
Ag colloids (Figure 1) after storage for 6 months indicated a large amount of particles
precipitated at the bottom of the colloidal container, while others
remain stably dispersed in the solution. Analysis and comparison of
the stable colloids and the precipitated particles were thus performed. Figures 2d–f and 3d–f show the morphologies of the stable Ag–SU-8
colloids after storage for 6 months. Compared to the fresh Ag colloids,
which have broad size distributions, the as-aged stable ex situ SU-8-functionalized
colloids have narrower size distributions. Particles larger than 30
nm were not detected. Approximately 99% number frequency of the stable
particles is in the range of 1–20 nm for both cases (Figures 2h and 3h). Therefore, the spontaneous size separation phenomenon
caused by large particle precipitation is evident for the ex situ
SU-8-functionalized Ag colloids. The average sizes of the ex situ
SU-8-functionalized 300 and 600 mW LAL–Ag NPs are 5.81 ±
4.55 nm (σ = 78.3%) and 5.07 ± 2.42 nm (σ = 47.7%),
respectively, which are significantly smaller than those of the fresh
Ag NPs used for ex situ functionalization and those Ag colloids stored
for 6 months (7.40 ± 7.56 nm (σ = 102.2%) for 300 mW LAL
and 7.82 ± 8.17 nm (σ = 104.5%) for 600 mW LAL), as shown
in ref (47). Size separation
phenomenon for the LAL–Ag colloids was also observed,47 where carbon shells, carbon clusters in liquids,
and self-assembled carbon sheets acted to capture large particles
and resulted in precipitation. However, compared to ex situ SU-8-functionalized
Ag colloids, many particles larger than 30 nm were still stable in
liquids. Precipitation of lesser amounts of large Ag particles and
no colloidal dilution meant that the concentrations of as-aged LAL–Ag
colloids without SU-8 functionalization were much higher than those
of stable SU-8-functionalized Ag after storage for 6 months, as evidenced
by the SPR peak intensities after storage for 6 months (2.0 and 1.3
for ex situ SU-8-functionalized 300 and 600 mW LAL colloids, respectively
(Figure 1c,d); 5.0
and 4.5 for 300 and 600 mW LAL colloids, respectively47). These results suggest: (1) ex situ SU-8 functionalized
600 mW LAL–Ag colloid possess higher efficiency and higher
ability for size separation than the functionalized 300 mW LAL–Ag
colloid; (2) ex situ SU-8 functionalization is much more efficient
for size separation than the LAL colloids as evidenced by a significant
decrease in the SPR peak intensity, which corresponds to stable colloidal
concentrations.

The morphologies of the precipitated particle
aggregates for ex situ SU-8-functionalized
300 and 600 mW LAL colloids are shown in Figure 4a–f, respectively. The maximal sizes
of the aggregates are in the micrometer scale (Figure 4b,e), and these are mainly composed of particles
larger than 10 nm (Figure 4g,h). The average sizes of the precipitated particles are
29.71 ± 34.25 nm (σ = 115.3%, Figure 4g) for 300 mW LAL and 36.66 ± 37.78
nm (σ = 103.1%, Figure 4h) for 600 mW LAL. As reported elsewhere,47 Ag NPs larger than 30 nm are encapsulated by carbon shells.
During the precipitation of large particles, the carbon shells should
also capture a large amount of smaller Ag NPs (Figure 4c,f) to be precipitated. That is why, the
precipitated particles include 22.5% (Figure 4g) and 16.5% (Figure 4h) small particles with sizes of 0–10
nm.

Figure 4 TEM images (a–f) and size distributions (g, h) of the precipitated
ex situ functionalized SU-8–Ag composites with the colloid
synthesized by LAL of Ag at laser powers of 300 mW (a–c, g)
and 600 mW (d–f, h) after 6 months storage.

Although aggregation induced by ex situ functionalization
significantly
reduces the Ag colloidal concentrations, it facilitates the development
of stable composites with narrower size distribution. Within the range
of 1–10 nm, the average sizes of ex situ SU-8-functionalized
Ag NPs for 300 and 600 mW LAL are 4.04 ± 1.07 nm (σ = 26.5%)
and 4.79 ± 1.57 nm (σ = 32.8%), respectively. Therefore,
the polydispersities of tiny Ag NPs (1–10 nm) also reduced
from 50.9 to ca. 30% after ex situ SU-8 functionalization. As reported
elsewhere,47 without ex situ functionalization,
the surfactant-free LAL-synthesized tiny Ag particles grow into 7–50
nm polygonal nanocrystals (Figure 5a). In contrast, the ex situ SU-8-functionalized Ag
colloids are spherical in shape (Figure 5b,c). Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce
that besides size separation ability, ex situ SU-8 functionalization
can also inhibit the particle growth. Different from the regular Ag
colloids stored for 6 months where large particles with diameters
of several hundreds of nanometers are stable,47 no such large particles are found in the six ex situ SU-8-functionalized
Ag colloids stored for 6 months (Figures 2d and 3d). This means
that the polymer does play an important role in the precipitation
of large particles.

Figure 5 (a) TEM image of the Ag colloid stored for 6 months, whereby
particle
growth into polygonal nanocrystals occurs. (b, c) TEM images of ex
situ Ag–SU-8 Ag colloids stored for 6 months, where most of
Ag particles are spherical, which indicates that particle growth is
inhibited by ex situ SU-8 functionalization.

The surface chemistry of LAL–Ag particles was examined
by
XPS (Figure 6a). The
percentages of Ag, C, and O quantified by XPS analysis are 16.82,
63.08, and 2.93%, indicating that the LAL-synthesized Ag particles
were covered by a thick layer of carbon. The peak fit of the high-resolution
C 1s spectrum by deconvolution (Figure 6c) confirmed the formation of both sp2 C=C
and sp3 C–C, which correspond to the characteristic
peaks at 284.5 and 285.2 eV.54 The presence
of sp2 and sp3 carbon corresponds to hybridized
C–C disordered graphite and crystalline diamond or soot, respectively.
The sp2/sp3 area ratio was calculated to be
59.29:20.00 ≈ 3:1, which indicates that the outermost surface
layers of the particles are mainly covered by disordered amorphous
carbon. Given that (1) the detection depth is only 5 nm for XPS characterization
and (2) Ag cores can be detected by XPS, the average thickness of
carbon shells is less than 5 nm. The high resolution of the XPS Ag
3d image (Figure 6b)
has two peaks of Ag 3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 at binding
energies of 368.0 and 374.1 eV, which is in good agreement with the
peaks of pure Ag.55 No other peaks corresponding
to AgO (367.3 eV) or Ag2O (367.8 eV)56 were observed; therefore, it can be concluded that pure
Ag particles are generated by femtosecond LAL of Ag in acetone. High-resolution
XPS O 1s (Figure 6d)
and C 1s (Figure 6c)
images show that C=O carbonyl group (531. 0 eV in the O1 spectrum
and 288.6 eV in the C 1s spectrum57,58), hydrocarbon
C–O group (532.2 eV in the O 1s spectrum and 286.0 eV in the
C 1s spectrum58), and −OH group
(531.6 eV in the O 1s spectrum59) should
conjugate the pure Ag particles. These groups originate from acetone
decomposition during LAL, and their adsorption on Ag NPs endows the
colloids with high stability,60 without
the need of surfactants used for wet-chemistry.

and (d) O 1s and the deconvoluted peaks.

Figure 7 shows
DSC
and TGA images of pure SU-8 and the ex situ synthesized Ag–SU-8
composites. Two peaks are discernible in the DSC profile of pure SU-8
photoresist (Figure 7a). The peak around 87 °C is associated with the cross-linking
reaction.61 The temperature of 87 °C,
at which the cross-linking reaction of SU-8 dissolved in acetone occurs,
is much lower than the 120 °C for the fluorinated SU-8,62 220, and 318 °C for pure SU-8 gel without
acetone dissolution (Figure 7a), indicating that the interaction between SU-8 and acetone
has already changed the thermal properties of the SU-8 photoresist.
The other peak at 419 °C for both acetone-dissolved SU-8 and
SU-8–Ag composites, where rapid loss of SU-8 mass occurs, is
attributed to the degradation of SU-8. In comparison, the degradation
temperature of pure SU-8 gel is 424 °C, different from that (419
°C) of acetone-dissolved SU-8 and SU-8–Ag composites.
Hence, it can be concluded that acetone dissolution indeed alters
SU-8 molecules, especially the photoinitiator density for cross-linking
actions. Compared to the pure SU-8, three new endothermic peaks are
detected at 199, 253, and 325 °C for the ex situ synthesized
Ag–SU-8 composites (Figure 7a, blue curve), which is ascribed to the debonding
temperatures between SU-8 and Ag NPs, similar to that of polymer–Ag
NP composites synthesized by other methods.63 The bonding between SU-8 and Ag NPs alters the glass-transition
temperature (Tg) of SU-8 polymer, which
increases Tg from 314 °C (pure SU-8)
to 331 °C after ex situ embedment of LAL–Ag NPs in SU-8,
as shown in the TGA profile (Figure 7b). Both Tg values of acetone-dissolved
SU-8 and SU-8–Ag composites are larger than 136 °C for
pure SU-8 gel (Figure 7b), which is attributed to the significant decrease in the photoinitiator
density after acetone dissolution. It is considered that the bonding
between LAL–Ag NPs and SU-8 polymers changed the distribution
of the polymer chain segments,64 which
partially prevents the cooperative motions necessary for the glass
transition to occur. After SU-8 degradation at 700 °C, 22 wt
% pyrolysate is residual, which is close to 25 wt % residue of SU-8
pyrolysate reported elsewhere.65 Deduced
from the TGA curve,66 the Ag NP content
is estimated to be 4 wt %. Epoxide rings are good synthetic intermediates;
therefore, it is speculated that the epoxy groups of SU-8 should be
first converted into hydroxyl groups and then act as initiator sites
for the free-radical polymerization of SU-8 photoresist.67

Figure 7 (a) DSC and (b) TGA analyses of SU-8 gel, acetone-dissolved
SU-8
polymer, and Ag–SU-8 composites synthesized by ex situ mixing
of LAL-synthesized colloids and SU-8 solution.

To confirm this speculation, FTIR analysis of chemical groups
that
are conjugated on the precipitated Ag NPs was performed, and the results
are shown in Figure 8. For a better understanding of how chemical groups of SU-8 change
after LAL–Ag NP binding, FTIR spectra of the pristine SU-8
and ex situ synthesized Ag–SU-8 composites (from the stable
colloids) are also shown (blue and red curves in Figure 8, respectively). The chemical
groups, wavenumbers for different peaks, and the vibrational bindings
are summarized in Table 1. The vibration bands at 1242, 833, and 912 cm–1 are associated with those of epoxy rings, which correspond to the
C–O–C asymmetric stretch, C–O–C symmetric
stretch, and CH2–O–CH bend.68 The band at 1295 cm–1 is attributed to
the C–O–H stretching vibration,69 while the bands at 1728 and 1792 cm–1 originate
from the C=O stretching bands70,73 of acetone
molecules. The bands at 2929 and 2872 cm–1 are related
to the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching peaks of the −CH2 groups,71 respectively, while
the 2964 cm–1 band is related to CH stretching.69 The broad band at 3480 cm–1 can be assigned to the OH– group.72

As indicated from the FTIR
spectra (Figure 8 and Table 1), no CH2–O–CH band of epoxy
rings was detected from the precipitated Ag NPs, while the C–O–H
group appears, both of which indicate the free-radical polymerization
of SU-8 photoresist with Ag NPs according to the scheme shown in Figure 9. The radicals are
due to acetone decomposition during LAL.1 Higher amounts of radicals are generated by LAL at a higher power,
which explains why the ex situ functionalized 600 mW LAL–Ag
NPs undergo a quicker precipitation while ex situ functionalized 300
mW LAL–Ag NPs undergo a slow precipitation (Figure 1). The preservation of epoxy
rings for the stable ex situ Ag–SU-8 composites, despite the
low concentration, means that polymerization of the composites could
also occur similarly to that of pristine SU-8 for the construction
of 3D structures or functional SU-8 composite films, which will be
examined in our future work. The red shift of the SPR band has been
attributed to variation of the surface chemistry53 or an increase of the particle size.74 In the present case, due to the decrease in the Ag particle
size after colloidal storage for 6 months (Figures 2d–f and 3d–f),
it can be concluded that alteration of the surface chemistry of Ag
NPs caused by ex situ SU-8 functionalization leads to the red shift
of the SPR band of the Ag colloids from 404 to 422 nm (Figure 1). Due to surface chemistry
alternation,75 the hydrodynamic diameters
of the SU-8-functionalized Ag NPs significantly increased to 187.6
± 41.2 (Figure 10a) and 254.6 ± 61.1 nm (Figure 10b) after 6 months storage. The larger hydrodynamic
sizes and broader hydrodynamic size distributions of Ag–SU-8
composites using 600 mW LAL–Ag colloids should be attributed
to higher amounts or stronger bindings of SU-8 molecules on Ag NPs
originating from more radicals generated during 600 mW LAL.

the free-radical polymerization of SU-8 on surfactant-free
Ag NPs.

Ag composite colloids

of (a) 300 mW and (b) 600 mW.

To demonstrate the universality of simultaneous particle
growth
inhibition and size separation phenomena induced by spontaneous radical
polymerization after ex situ SU-8 functionalization, the absorbance
difference between 3 weeks-aged Au colloid synthesized by LAL in acetone
and the Au colloid ex situ functionalized by SU-8 is shown in Figure 11 for comparison.
Similarly to the case of Ag colloids shown in Figure 1, the SPR intensity of SU-8-functionalized
Au colloid significantly decreases from 2.3 to 0.4 after 3 weeks storage.
In comparison, the SPR intensity of 3 weeks-aged Au colloid without
SU-8 functionalization slightly increases from 2.3 to 2.7 due to acetone
volatilization-induced AuNP concentration increase. That is why, the
optical transparency of the aged Au and SU-8–Au colloids is
very different, as indicated by the inset optical images in Figure 11a. After 3 weeks
storage, the SPR peak positions of Au colloid and the SU-8–Au
composite colloid shift from 531 to 533 and 537 nm, respectively,
indicating the particle growth of Au particles during storage and
the surface alteration of Au particles after SU-8 functionalization,
respectively. Figure 12 shows the TEM images of the Au colloid (Figure 12a–c) and SU-8-functionalized Au colloid
(Figure 12d–f)
and the calculated size distributions (Figure 12g,h). As clearly shown, the aged Au colloid
has large particles with maximal size up to 87 nm, while in comparison,
the maximal size of SU-8-functionalized supernatant Au colloid after
3 weeks storage is only 25 nm. Many polygonal Au particles are found
from the aged Au colloid (Figure 13a) but seldom found from the SU-8-functionalized Au
colloid (Figure 13b). This phenomenon indicates that SU-8 functionalization indeed
inhibits the particle growth, which can also be deduced from the smaller
average sizes of SU-8-functionalized Au particles in the range of
0–10 nm (Figure 12g,h; 3.98 ± 1.62 and 3.66 ± 1.54 nm for aged Au
particles and SU-8-functionalized Au particles, respectively). Taking
together, the above-mentioned findings give an evidence that radical
polymerization between SU-8 molecules and LAL-generated Au particles
causes the precipitation of large particles and inhibits the particle
growth, similarly to the case of ex situ SU-8-functionalized Ag colloids.
Recently, we have shown that the carbon clusters and the carbon shells
of metal particles can behave as captors to capture large particles
to become nanoaggregates and make them precipitate over time.47 The precipitation of Au colloids also occurred
during the storage. Due to similarity to Ag colloids, analysis of
the precipitated Au particles was not performed in this work. In both
cases, many large particles are still stable in the liquids even after
storage for 6 months. In contrast, the size separation ability of
ex situ SU-8 photoresist functionalization is more efficient in spite
of severe colloid precipitation.

Conclusions
This work has demonstrated
that ex situ SU-8 functionalization
of surfactant-free Ag NPs not only allows the size selection of small
particles, but also enables the inhibition of particle growth into
polygonal nanocrystals. Spontaneous aggregation and precipitation
of the large particles with diameters of 10–300 nm occurred
during long-term storage for 6 months, irrespective of the initial
amount of the large particles synthesized by LAL at laser powers of
300 and 600 mW. The colloidal concentrations thus significantly decreased,
and the size distributions of the colloids narrowed with the polydispersity
of the overall sizes changing from initial 126–207 to final
50–80%. As for the predominantly small (1–10 nm) particles
with average sizes of 4–5 nm that occupied 82–96% number
frequency of the stable SU-8-functionalized Ag NPs, the polydispersity
decreased from 50.9 to 26.5–32.8%. XPS and FTIR joint analysis
confirmed free-radical polymerization of SU-8 on surfactant-free Ag
NPs, which is considered to be the underlying mechanism for both spontaneous
size separation and growth inhibition phenomena. The acetone dissolution
and the interaction between the SU-8 molecules and surfactant-free
LAL-generated Ag NPs also altered the thermal properties of SU-8 photoresist.
Three new endothermic peaks (199, 253, and 419 °C) were observed
in the DSC curve, while the glass-transition temperature of SU-8 increased
from 314 to 331 °C when the ex situ SU-8-functionalized Ag NP
was ca. 4 wt % of the overall weight of the composites. Successful
narrowing of the size distribution of metallic colloids by ex situ
photoresist functionalization and long-term storage may offer a solution
to solve the broad size distribution problem of LAL colloids. It is
noteworthy that if adopting this method for size control, precipitation-induced
decrease in the colloid concentration will significantly lower the
mass for practical applications.

Methods
Silver
colloids were synthesized by laser ablation of Ag in acetone
for approximately 60 min using a femtosecond laser (FGPA μ Jewel
D-1000-UG3, IMRA America Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) with pulse duration,
wavelength, and repetition rate of 457 fs, 1045 nm, and 100 kHz, respectively.
Two laser powers of 300 and 600 mW were adopted for LAL. A 20 mm diameter
and 1 mm thick silver plate was placed inside a glass dish (45 mm
diameter and 18 mm height) filled with 8 mL of acetone for LAL. A
10 mm diameter and 5 mm thick gold target was placed inside a smaller
glass dish (35 mm diameter and 15 mm height) filled with 8 mL of acetone
for LAL. The thickness of the liquid was approximately 5 mm above
the target surface. The femtosecond laser beam was focused on the
Ag plate surface using a 20× objective lens (numerical aperture
= 0.4, Mitutoyo, Japan). An area of 3.5 × 3.5 mm2 was
scanned at a scan speed of 1 mm/s. The parallel-line scanning method
described in refs (76−78) was adopted
with an adjacent line interval of 5 μm. After synthesis, the
colloids were directly mixed with the acetone-dissolved SU-8 (SU-8
2050, MicroChem) polymer solutions to make the weight ratio of Ag
or Au colloids (including the acetone solvent used for LAL) occupy
12 wt % of the mixed solution. The colloids were stored and sealed
in a glass container at room temperature. After storage for 6 months,
both the colloids in the liquids and the precipitated particles at
the bottom of the glass container were characterized by TEM and UV–vis
spectroscopy. The masses of the synthesized Ag colloids obtained by
LAL at 300 and 600 mW were measured by comparing the weight of the
Ag target before and after LAL. The residual masses of stable supernatant
Ag colloids after 6 months storage were estimated by comparing the
peak intensity of the fresh Ag colloids diluted by acetone with different
volume ratios. The residual weight ratios of supernatant SU-8–Ag
composite colloids and acetone solvents after 6 months storage in
both cases were measured by comparing the weight of glass slides used
for composite film deposition, the weight of the colloid used for
film deposition, and the glass slides with dried SU-8–Ag composite
films. The weight ratios of acetone in both supernatant SU-8–Ag
composite colloids, which were stored for 6 months, were ca. 89 wt
%.

Transmission electron microscope (Jeol JEM-1230) and UV–vis
spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus) were used to characterize the
morphologies of Ag NPs and Ag–SU-8 composites and record the
variation in the absorption spectra of composite over time. For XPS
(Rigaku SmartLab-R 3 kW) characterization, the colloids were centrifuged
by a centrifuge (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5430, Germany) at a rotation
speed of 14 000 rpm for 10 min and then deposited on the glass
substrates. The surface chemistry of the Ag particles was analyzed
by FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu, Prestige-21). The Ag NPs precipitated
at the bottom of the container were separated from the stable composite
colloids and then washed twice with acetone. After each washing, the
precipitated colloids were centrifuged and separated from the upper
solutions to ensure that the remaining SU-8 in the liquid was removed
from the precipitated Ag NPs. Then, the precipitated Ag–SU-8
composites were then directly used for FTIR characterization. For
DSC–TGA (Mettler Toledo, TGA/DSC2, Greifensee, Switzerland)
and FTIR characterization of the acetone-dissolved pure SU-8 and the
ex situ functionalized Ag–SU-8 composites, the solutions were
deposited on glass substrates and then dried in an oven at 60 °C
for 10 h. The DSC–TGA measurement of pure SU-8 gel without
acetone dissolution was also performed for comparison. DSC–TGA
measurements were implemented in nitrogen gas at a heating rate of
20 °C every 5 min. After solidification, small pieces of the
dried SU-8 and Ag–SU-8 composite films were peeled off from
the glass and used for FTIR characterization. A particle size analyzer
(ELSZ-2PL, Photal, Osaka, Japan) was used to measure the hydrodynamic
diameters of 6 months-aged SU-8-functionalized Ag particles.
