Herein, we developed
a natural surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) substrate based on size-tunable Au@Ag nanoparticle-coated mussel
shell to form large-scale three-dimensional (3D) supercrystals (up
to 10 cm2) that exhibit surface-laminated structures and
crossed nanoplates and nanochannels. The high content of CaCO3 in the mussel shell results in superior hydrophobicity for
analyte enrichment, and the crossed nanoplates and nanochannels provided
rich SERS hot spots, which together lead to high sensitivity. Finite-difference
time-domain simulations showed that nanoparticles in the channels
exhibit apparently a higher electromagnetic field enhancement than
nanoparticles on the platelets. Thus, under optimized conditions (using
Au@AgNPs with 5 nm shell thickness), highly sensitive SERS detection
with a detection limit as low as 10–9 M for rhodamine
6G was obtained. Moreover, the maximum electromagnetic field enhancement
of different types of 3D supercrystals shows no apparent difference,
and Au@AgNPs were uniformly distributed such that reproducible SERS
measurements with a 6.5% variation (613 cm–1 peak)
over 20 spectra were achieved. More importantly, the as-prepared SERS
substrates can be utilized for the fast discrimination of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by discriminant
analysis. This novel Au@Ag self-assembled mussel shell template holds
considerable promise as low-cost, durable, sensitive, and reproducible
substrates for future SERS-based biosensors.

Introduction
The surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) is a nondestructive
and high ultrasensitive analytical technique that can provide “fingerprints”
of molecules. It can be used as a qualitative tool in the analysis
of unknown samples or to distinguish target molecules from a mixture
of components. SERS relies on the enhancement of electromagnetic fields
around metal nanoparticles to strongly increase Raman signals when
molecules are attached to the nanoparticles.1,2 In
general, noble metals such as silver, gold, and copper are widely
used as SERS active substrates with or without decoration.3−5 Yet, the nanoprobes are used in solution, which results in random
particle diffusion and heterogeneous distribution, ultimately leading
to poor reproducibility in SERS detection.6,7

A convenient way to improve SERS performance is to assemble metallic
nanoparticles into three-dimensional (3D) structures. The hierarchical
structure of such 3D structures results in the generation of ordered
nanoparticles “clusters” with localized and abundant
nanometer-level gaps to interact with the target molecules. In this
way, more “hot spots” are created in a small area, and
the SERS signals of absorbed analytes are enhanced.8−11 For the creation of varying size,
shape, and precise positioning of 3D nanostructures on support materials,
many strategies such as electron beam lithography,12,13 electrochemical deposition,14,15 or magnetron sputtering16,17 are normally employed. However, such methods are expensive, time-consuming,
and require highly qualified personnel. Current trends are aimed to
the use of natural 3D materials such as filter paper,18 nanoporous zeolite19 or silicon,20 and cotton swab21 as SERS templates. Yet, the low hydrophobicity of the above-mentioned
materials prevents adequate analyte and nanoparticle enrichment for
highly efficient SERS detection.

Recently, some natural materials
with both 3D structures and hydrophobicity
have been employed in the preparation of active SERS substrates. Because
of its inherent hierarchical nanostructure, such materials can not
only provide 3D structures to decorate nanoparticles, but also possess
unique hydrophobicity to form beaded droplets on its surface. Droplet
evaporation results in localized spots containing nanoparticles or
analytes, and thus contributes to further increase in the SERS detection
sensitivity.22,23 For example, Huang et al. have
demonstrated a highly efficient SERS substrate based on natural taro
leaf decorated with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The micropapillae
of the taro leaf exhibited hydrophobicity for analyte enrichment through
the hydrophobic concentrating effect, and the secondary-crossed nanoplates
acted as 3D templates to provide rich SERS hot spots after the decoration
with AgNPs. Thereby, highly sensitive SERS detection with a detection
limit as low as 10–8 M was achieved.24 Sharma et al. employed five different types
of plant leaf as the SERS substrate, in connection with gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs). They found that the assembly helped by the hydrophobicity
of plants surfaces
helps to increase the SERS enhancement factor.25 Rose petals have also been evaluated as 3D templates with
natural hydrophobicity for the decoration of metal nanoparticles.22,26 However, such materials lack periodic structures to ensure uniform
distribution of the metal nanoparticles. As an alternative, cicada
and butterfly wings with the hydrophobicity nature and ordered nanostructures
were evaluated as SERS substrates.27,28 Yet, their
poor mechanical strength and short storage time hamper its practical
application.

In this study, we aim to develop an SERS substrate
through using
the nacre from mussel shell as a new kind of natural material for
the self-assembly of size-tunable Au@AgNPs. Natural mussel shells
exhibit hydrophobicity because of its major inorganic composition
of CaCO3 and surface micro/nanohierarchical structures.29 Thus, nanaoparticles (NPs) and analyte enrichment
can be achieved to enhance the SERS sensitivity. The specific 3D hierarchical
structures can be used as templates for the self-assembly of Au@Ag
nanoparticles to form 3D supercrystals, which can lead to intense
and controlled antenna effects, resulting in huge electromagnetic
field.30,31 Additionally, such laminated structures
give the shell a twofold increase in strength and 1000-fold increase
in roughness over its constituent materials.32 Thus, the developed substrate will show obvious higher mechanical
strength compared with other natural materials such as plant leaf,
petals, cicada wings, and butterfly wings. More importantly, the grating
microstructures of nacre on the mussel shell, which make the iridescence
color of the shell because of the interference and diffraction of
the natural light, are distributed periodically.33 Such periodic grating microstructures will make the distribution
of nanoparticles with high periodicity over the micrometer scale of
the SERS substrate. Thus the signal reproducibility could be significantly
improved at a large scale. Interestingly, some research works have
shown that the interference and diffraction surface excitation caused
by the periodic grating will benefit the SERS sensitivity.34 Therefore, the nacre of mussel shell can act
as a new kind of natural material in the preparation of SERS 3D supercrystals
to display both higher sensitivity and signal reproducibility. Another
aim is to employ the as-prepared Au@AgNPs self-assembled mussel shell
substrate for the detection and discrimination of three different
kinds of pathogenic bacteria.

Results and Discussion
Optimization of the Metal
Nanoparticles
Different kinds
of metal nanoparticles and different shell thicknesses of Au@AgNPs
may show different Raman enhancement activities after self-assembly
on the mussel shell. To optimize the most suitable metal nanoparticles
in the fabrication of mussel shell substrate, the SERS activity among
different thicknesses of Au@AgNPs, AgNPs, and AuNPs has been evaluated.

First, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used in
the characterization of AgNPs and Au@AgNPs with different thicknesses
of Ag shell. Figure 1a,b has shown the low-magnification and high-magnification image
of AgNPs. We can measure that the size of AgNPs is ∼40 ±
12.5 nm. Figure 1c
is the low magnification of Au@AgNPs with 5 nm thickness of Ag shell,
which indicated that the sizes of the Au@AgNPs are uniform. Figure 1d–h (high
magnification) showed that the thickness of Ag shells increased as
the amount of AgNO3 increased, and it can be seen that
the Ag shells range from 1 to 9 nm for a fixed ∼30 ± 5.6
nm Au core. It also can be clearly observed that Au@AgNPs become larger
with the increase of the Ag shell thickness. The UV–vis absorbance
spectra of the as-prepared Au@AgNPs with different Ag shell thicknesses
also have been measured, and the results are shown in the Figure S2. It can be observed that as the thickness
of the Ag shell increased, the absorption peak shifts from 510 to
400 nm.

Figure 1 (a) Low-magnification TEM images of AgNPs. (b) High-magnification
TEM of AgNPs. (c) Low-magnification TEM of Au@AgNPs with 5 nm thickness
of Ag shell. (d–h) High-magnification TEM images of Au@AgNPs
with Ag shell thicknesses of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 nm, respectively.

Subsequently, AuNPs, AgNPs, and
Au@AgNPs with different Ag shell
thicknesses have been self-assembled on the mussel shell under the
same condition (20 μL of sample volume, room temperature) to
evaluate their Raman enhancement activity. The concentrations of AuNPs
used here is ∼0.26 nM, whereas AgNPs is ∼0.62 nM. The
concentration of Au@AgNPs with different thicknesses of Ag shell is
∼0.18–0.25 nM. The stabilizer of both AuNPs (0.5 nM)
and AgNPs (1.4 nM) is sodium citrate. The stabilizer of Au@AgNPs is
ascorbic acid (10 mM). R6G (10–3 M) was used as
the probe molecule. As depicted in Figure 2a,b, it is obvious that SERS intensity of
bands is enhanced as the thickness of the Ag shell increases from
1 to 5 nm, and then decreased with Ag shell above 5 nm, which may
because of the unstable and easily precipitate of the Au@AgNPs when
the shell thicknesses are further increased.35 Thus, we conclude that the SERS enhancement effect of Au@AgNPs is
related to the Ag shell thickness. We also have compared the SERS
activity of Au@AgNPs to AuNPs and AgNPs. Results showed that AuNPs
show weakest SERS enhancement effect among these different kinds of
nanoparticles, whereas AgNPs show SERS activity between 7 and 3 nm
Au@AgNPs. Thus, the Au@AgNPs with a shell thickness of 5 nm have been
used for the self-assembly of mussel shell in the following research.

spectrum of mussel shell self-assembled with different
kinds of metal nanoparticles. (b) Peaks intensity of SERS spectrum

of R6G was 10–3 M.

Characterization of the Mussel Shell-Based Substrate
Figure 3a shows the
photograph of a cleaned mussel shell. From the inset photograph, it
is obvious that a water droplet can keep a sphere shape, which confirms
its dewetting nature and indicates the hydrophobic property of it.
As depicted in Figure 3b, the static water contact angle (CA) of the mussel shell was 100.5°
before the self-assembly of nanoparticles, indicating the hydrophobic
nature of the nacre mussel shell. Figure 3b also shows that the CA of the mussel shell
is 99.6° after the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs with a shell thickness
of 5 nm, indicating that the mussel shell still possesses hydrophobic
property after the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs. Thus, these hydrophobic
surfaces will accumulate the target molecule into a small size to
enhance the SERS signals, even though the surfaces of the mussel shells
are coated with nanoparticles.

and the inset showing a
water droplet on its surface. (b) CAs of mussel shell before and after
the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs. (c) Optical absorption spectra of mussel
shell before and after the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs. (d) SERS spectra
of R6G solution recorded with two laser excitations. EDS spectra of
mussel shell before (e) and after (f) the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs.
Au@AgNPs with a 5 nm shell thickness were used in all cases.

Figure 3c shows
the optical absorption spectra of Au@AgNPs (5 nm Ag shell thickness),
self-assembled mussel shell, and the blank mussel shell. These two
spectra all show adsorption peaks at 390 nm, attributed to the bare
mussel shell. The spectra show the broad localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) absorption bands of Au@AgNPs at around 510 nm, which
is different from its absorption spectrum in solution state (see Figure S2), indicating the formation of novel
Au@AgNPs nanostructures onto the mussel shell. Previous studies have
revealed that the LSPR is the major mechanism for SERS in the case
of metal nanoparticles.36 That is, the
more wavelength match between surface plasmon band of the SERS substrate
and the laser, the line may get higher SERS signals. Thus, the strongest
SERS signals were obtained at 532 nm laser excitation. However, a
large amount of fluorescence background signals existed in the SERS
spectrum at 532 nm excitation, resulting in the loss of any useful
information from Raman peaks (Figure 3d, red line). The better SERS performance was acquired
with 633 nm excitation (Figure 3d, black line), which was then selected as optimal.

For the element analysis, energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS)
spectrum of elements indicates the presence of calcium, carbon, and
oxygen on the mussel shell before the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs (Figure 3e). Such results
are consistent with the previous reports which indicated that nacre
shells are mainly composed by inorganic CaCO3.29Figure 3f shows silver and gold distribution after the self-assembly
of Au@AgNPs with a shell thickness of 5 nm, which reveals the presence
of Au@AgNPs on the substrate.

The 3D structures of nacre on
mussel shells were further characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 4a,b shows low- and high-magnification images
of the nanostructures of nacre on the shell before the self-assembly
of Au@AgNPs. A clear distribution into polygon platelets can be clearly
observed. This indicated that such natural material can provide specific
3D-laminated structures when used as templates for the self-assembly
of Au@Ag nanoparticles. Importantly, such laminated structures give
the shell a twofold increase in strength and a 1000-fold increase
in toughness over its constituent materials.32 It should be mentioned here that the nacre shell substrate displays
apparent higher mechanical strength compared with the other natural
materials such as plant leaf, petals, or inset wings, acting thus
as a more durable SERS substrate. For example, the mussel shell was
hard to be damaged even after a pulling force experiment and kept
its original state under the room temperature for a long time (Figure S3). Importantly, the Au@AgNPs self-assembled
the mussel shell substrate can keep its high SERS activity for a long
time (up to six months) and even at high temperature (Figure S4). Also, the toughness of the surface
may contribute to the hydrophobicity of the shell. Figure 4c,d shows low- and high-magnification
images of the nanostructure of the nacre on the shell after the self-assembly
of Au@AgNPs. As can be seen, almost all of the polygon platelets of
the mussel shell are fully coated with Au@AgNPs. These NPs were orderly
arranged and homogeneously distributed along the laminated platelets
of the mussel shell, the average gap between each adjacent NP which
measured from 20 different random gaps is about 27 ± 5.9 nm.
During the evaporation of the colloids, the spontaneous formation
of the self-assembled supercrystals of Au@AgNPs takes place.30,31 Thus, every laminated nanoplate was formed on 3D Au@AgNPs supercrystals,
and the distribution of nanoplates results in different shapes of
3D supercrystals. The gap of two adjacent 3D supercrystals is about
220 ± 49.5 nm. Such features result in a large scale of 3D supercrystals
arrays (up to 10 cm2) (Figure S5). Therefore, the obtained novel 3D supercrystals will provide a
robust substrate for application as SERS spot.

shell after the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs. The inset image on (b)
is the higher magnification of the blank mussel shell, and the inset
image on (d) show the higher magnification of Au@Ag self-assembled
on the mussel shell substrate.

Additionally, the colorful nacre on the mussel shell contributed
to the reproducibility of the as-prepared substrate to some extent. Figure S6a shows the nacre of the mussel shell
which was taken by a digital camera. We can see that its surface is
colorful. Figure S6b shows the periodic
grating microstructures of nacre on the mussel shell, which contribute
to the iridescence color of the shell. Previous research works have
proven that the groove density of the grating structure on the shell
will exactly cause the diffraction of light.37 The interference and diffraction surface excitation, caused by the
periodic grating, will benefit SERS detection.38 Thus, it is worth pointing out that the 3D hierarchical
nanostructures, hydrophobicity, and periodic microstructures contribute
to the high Raman enhancement and repeatability.

3D FDTD Simulation
We use the finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) method to study the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic
fields according to the distribution of the Au@AgNPs acquired by SEM.
As depicted in Figure 5a, the distribution of 3D supercrystals is in different modes (yellow
lines), and it can be divided into three shapes of the FDTD model
including “V” style, “Y” style, and “cross”
style (Figure 5b).
In this simulation, the diameter of Au@Ag nanoparticles was set at
35 nm, the width of the channel between two platelets was set as 220
nm, and the gap between two nanoparticles was set as 27 nm. The FDTD
simulation based on such 3D supercrystals with different distribution
modes of “V” style, “Y” style, and “cross”
style is shown in Figure 5c–e. First of all, it can be obviously observed that
nanoparticles in the channels (the edge of 3D supercrystals) exhibit
apparent higher electromagnetic fields than nanoparticles on the platelets
(inside the 3D supercrystals) in all of these distribution modes.
This can theoretically prove that nanoparticles in channels between
the polygon platelets will show higher SERS activity than nanoparticles
on the platelets. In other words, the mussel shell with natural platelets
can serve as an excellent SERS substrate after the self-assembly of
Au@AgNPs. Second, these three kinds of channels exhibit high electromagnetic
field enhancement and show no apparent difference of the maximum electromagnetic
field enhancement. This will make the distribution of electromagnetic
field enhancement more uniform. Last, since different kinds of channel
appear all over the whole mussel shell surface, the significantly
enhanced electromagnetic field by the channels should dominate the
enhancement of SERS signals, leading to high sensitivity and reproducibility. Figure 5f also showed the
intersecting surface of these different kinds of channels on the mussel
shell. We can observe that nanoparticles at the top of the channel
show higher electromagnetic field enhancement than nanoparticles at
the bottom of the channel, which is very useful to enhance the substrate
absorption on the surface of 3D supercrystals. As the size of bacteria
is larger than the channel, such target analytes thus cannot be absorbed
into the channel.

and is polarized in the x–y plane.

SERS Performance
Figure 6 shows the
SERS spectra of different concentrations
of R6G droplets (20 μL) in the range of 1 × 10–3 to 1 × 10–9 M, which was detected after being
evaporated naturally onto the 3D supercrystals. The Raman bands at
613, 770, and 1124 cm–1 can be assigned to C–C–C
ring in-plane bending, C–H out-of-plane bending, and C–H
in-plane bending, respectively. Other features at 1312, 1361, 1510,
1572, and 1647 cm–1 all stemmed from the aromatic
C–C stretching vibrations. It can be seen that even at a concentration
of 1 × 10–9 M, some peaks of R6G such as 613
and 770 cm–1 can be clearly identified. Additionally,
the Raman bands at 702 and 1085 cm–1 come from the
blank mussel shell. As described above, three aspects have contributed
to such Raman enhancement. First of all, the hydrophobicity of the
mussel shell helps to concentrate the Au@AgNPs and analytes into a
small size. Second, the specific 3D structures of the mussel shell
can act as a template for the self-assembly of Au@AgNPs to form 3D
supercrystals. At last, the microstructures of the nacre on the mussel
shell have a periodic grating, which will enhance the Raman signal
to some extent. Thus, the 3D supercrystals’ substrate will
bring high and stable enhancement ability. An enhancement factor (EF)
of 1.02 × 107 can be obtained (please see Figure S7
in the Supporting Information).

Figure 6 SERS spectra
of R6G in the range of 1 × 10–3 to 1 ×
10–9 M on the developed SERS substrate.

In addition to the high SERS enhancement ability,
the as-prepared
mussel shell-based substrate provided reproducible SERS signals. As
depicted in Figure 7a, the SERS spectra of R6G from 20 random spots within an area of
100 μm2 were recorded and the results showed that
the SERS substrate provided uniform SERS enhancement upon its entire
surface. Furthermore, we also compared the intensities of the 613
cm–1 peak of R6G, and the relative standard deviation
(RSD) was calculated to be 6.5% (Figure 7b). To assess the spot-to-spot reproducibility,
the mapping technique has been used by selecting 10 μm ×
10 μm = 100 μm2 area with a step size of 1
μm. As depicted in Figure 7c, the intensity of the 613 cm–1 peak
from R6G was plotted to evaluate the uniformity of the entire SERS
substrate, in which every pixel represents the intensity of the Raman
peak at the spatial position on the mussel shell substrates. Results
have shown that the as-prepared mussel shell substrate have a good
uniformity and reproducibility over its entire area.

Bacteria Detection
Sensitive and simultaneous detection
of pathogenic bacteria is critical for human health because of many
serious and fatal diseases caused by bacterial infections. In the
label-free detection of bacteria, different kinds of bacteria will
show special Raman fingerprints.39 In this
study, three kinds of bacteria including Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus have been
chosen as models to investigate the potential of the mussel shell
substrate in the discrimination of bacteria. The Raman spectra of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus from 36 batches (each
kind of bacteria was represented by 12 batches) were acquired and
depicted in Figure 8a–c. To maximize the spectral differences resulting from the
data arrays in the discrimination of bacteria, discriminant analysis
(DA) has been introduced here. Figure 8d shows the 3D map of the DA results, where red balls
represent E. coli, green balls represent P. aeruginosa, and blue balls represent S. aureus. It can be seen that they are completely
independent with each other in the space, which means that our SERS
method combined with DA could be used to distinguish different kinds
of bacteria.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have developed a low-cost, durable, sensitive, and
repeatable SERS substrate based on hydrophobic and nanohierarchical
structures of mussel shell. Because of the hydrophobic concentration
effect, Au@AgNPs and analyte molecules both aggregate on the mussel
shell. The nanohierarchical structures could act as 3D templates for
the self-assembly of nanoparticles to form 3D supercrystals. FDTD
results have shown that nanoparticles in the channels exhibit apparent
higher electromagnetic field enhancement than nanoparticles on the
platelets. The distribution of nanoplates in different modes shows
no apparent difference of the maximum electromagnetic field enhancement,
which makes the distribution of electromagnetic field enhancement
more uniform. The periodic gratings on the mussel shell also have
made the distribution of nanoparticles with high periodicity on the
SERS substrate. All of these have revealed that the special structure
of the nacre makes the mussel shell a good candidate for the decoration
of nanoparticles to form 3D supercrystals. As a result, the 3D supercrystals
could reach an LOD (limit of detection) for R6G as low as 1 ×
10–9 M, and signal reproducibility could be significantly
improved and measured with a variation of 6.5% at the peak of 613
cm–1. The as-prepared SERS substrate also has been
utilized in the discrimination of different kinds of pathogenic bacteria.
As shown in Table 1, the mussel shell has demonstrated obvious advantages compared to
other natural materials, and it can act as a good substrate for the
detection of other practical analytes.

Experimental Section
Chemicals, Biochemicals,
and Instruments
Mussel shells
were purchased from the local market in China. Rhodamine 6G (Rh6G),
chloroauric acid tetrahydrate (HAuCl4·4H2O), trisodium citrate, and ascorbic acid were supplied by Macklin
(Shanghai, China). Silver nitrate (AgNO3) was purchased
from Aladdin. Ultrapure water was obtained using a Millipore water
purification system. All chemicals were of the analytical grade. E. coli (ATCC8739), S. aureus (ATCC6538), and P. aeruginosa (PAO1)
shock-frozen strains were purchased from Guangdong Microbial Culture
Center (Guangdong, China).

The morphologies and microstructures
of the mussel shell-based substrate were investigated by field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS ULTRA55), and the core–shell
structures Au@AgNPs were characterized using a transmission electron
microscope (JEM-2100F). UV–vis spectra were recorded with a
Varian Cary-5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer. SERS
measurements were conducted with a Raman microscope (LabRAM HR, HORIBA
Scientific, Japan). The CA was measured with OCA20 machine (Data Physics,
Germany).

Preparation of Au and Ag Nanoparticles (AuNPs)
Before
use, all glassware were soaked in 3:1 HNO3/HCl overnight,
followed by ultrapure water and dried in the dry oven. AuNPs and AgNPs
were all prepared according to the previous report with some modifications.40 First, 125 μL of HAuCl4 solution
(0.1 M) was added to 50 mL of boiling ultrapure water under magnetic
stirring. Subsequently, 750 μL of trisodium citrate (1%) was
added, and the solution was agitated for 30 min to obtain a wine-red
suspension. After the suspension was cooled to room temperature, the
as-prepared AuNPs were filtered through a 0.22 μm Millipore
membrane and stored at 4 °C. For Ag nanoparticle preparation,
90 mg of AgNO3 was first dissolved in 250 mL of ultrapure
water and brought to boiling. Then, 10 mL trisodium citrate (1%) was
added into the above solution and kept boiling for 1 h. The AgNP colloids
were obtained after cooling to room temperature. The calculation of
concentrations of AuNPs and AgNPs is based on the Beer’s law
and the extinction coefficient (εAu = 3 × 109 M–1 cm–1 and εAg = 2.3 × 1010 M–1 cm–1). Thus, the concentrations of AuNPs and AgNPs are
∼0.26 and ∼0.62 nM.35

Synthesis
of Au@Ag Nanoparticles with Different Ag Shell Thickness
All glassware were treated with 3:1 HNO3/HCl and ultrasonically
with deionized water prior to use. Au@AgNPs were prepared through
the reduction of silver nitrate onto the surface of as-prepared AuNPs,
according to the previous report.41 In
a 50 mL flask, 10 mL of the as-prepared AuNPs and 1.5 mL of ascorbic
acid (0.1 M) were mixed and kept under stirring. Then, 1 mM AgNO3 was added drop by drop and stirred for 30 min at room temperature.
For different thicknesses of Ag shells from 1 to 9 nm, the volumes
of 1 mM AgNO3 solution were increased from 0.5 to 4.5 mL.
The as-prepared Au@AgNPs with different Ag shell thicknesses were
stored at 4 °C for the further self-assembly with mussel shell.
The final concentration of Au@AgNPs is ∼0.18–0.25 nM,
as calculated based on Au cores and the change of volume.35

Fabrication of SERS Substrates
The
mussels obtained
commercially were first scalded with boiling water for a moment, and
the meats were removed from the shell. Then, the mussel shells were
washed in an ultrasound bath with ethanol and deionized water in turn
for 10 min individually. As depicted in Figure S1, a 20 μL droplet of a suspension of different Ag shell
thickness of Au@AgNPs was placed on the nacre of the mussel shell
and allowed to dry naturally. For different experimental aims, a 20
μL droplet of rhodamine 6G with different concentrations were
then placed on the SERS substrate and allowed to dry again.

Bacteria
Preparation and SERS Measurements
Shock-frozen E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus cells were cultivated
in Luria–Bertani medium in a gyratory shaker at 100 rpm and
37 °C for 16 h. Five milliliters of bacteria were harvested and
washed twice with deionized water by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and
25 °C. Subsequently, the obtained bacteria were utilized for
the SERS measurement.

The Raman signals of R6G and three different
kinds of bacteria were obtained after the droplet evaporated naturally
and measured on the Raman system with the 633 nm laser as excitation.
The power density of the laser is 16.0 mW/μm2. A
50× objective lens was used, and the time acquisition was 5 s.
