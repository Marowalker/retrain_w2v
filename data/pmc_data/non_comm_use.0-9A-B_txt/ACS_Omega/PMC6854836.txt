Binary silicon boride
SiB3 has been reported to occur in two forms, as disordered
and nonstoichiometric
α-SiB3–x, which relates to
the α-rhombohedral phase of boron, and as strictly ordered and
stoichiometric β-SiB3. Similar to other boron-rich
icosahedral solids, these SiB3 phases represent potentially
interesting refractory materials. However, their thermal stability,
formation conditions, and thermodynamic relation are poorly understood.
Here, we map the formation conditions of α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 and analyze their relative
thermodynamic stabilities. α-SiB3–x is metastable (with respect to β-SiB3 and
Si), and its formation is kinetically driven. Pure polycrystalline
bulk samples may be obtained within hours when heating stoichiometric
mixtures of elemental silicon and boron at temperatures 1200–1300
°C. At the same time, α-SiB3–x decomposes into SiB6 and Si, and optimum time-temperature
synthesis conditions represent a trade-off between rates of formation
and decomposition. The formation of stable β-SiB3 was observed after prolonged treatment (days to weeks) of elemental
mixtures with ratios Si/B = 1:1–1:4 at temperatures 1175–1200
°C. The application of high pressures greatly improves the kinetics
of SiB3 formation and allows decoupling of SiB3 formation from decomposition. Quantitative formation of β-SiB3 was seen at 1100 °C for samples pressurized to 5.5–8
GPa. β-SiB3 decomposes peritectoidally at temperatures
between 1250 and 1300 °C. The highly ordered nature of β-SiB3 is reflected in its Raman spectrum, which features narrow
and distinct lines. In contrast, the Raman spectrum of α-SiB3–x is characterized by broad bands,
which show a clear relation to the vibrational modes of isostructural,
ordered B6P. The detailed composition and structural properties
of disordered α-SiB3–x were
ascertained by a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction and 29Si magic angle spinning NMR experiments. Notably, the compositions
of polycrystalline bulk samples (obtained at T ≤
1200 °C) and single crystal samples (obtained from Si-rich molten
Si–B mixtures at T > 1400 °C) are
different,
SiB2.93(7) and SiB2.64(2), respectively. The
incorporation of Si in the polar position of B12 icosahedra
results in highly strained cluster units. This disorder feature was
accounted for in the refined crystal structure model by splitting
the polar position into three sites. The electron-precise composition
of α-SiB3–x is SiB2.5 and corresponds to the incorporation of, on average, two Si atoms
in each B12 icosahedron. Accordingly, α-SiB3–x constitutes a mixture of B10Si2 and B11Si clusters. The structural and phase stability
of α-SiB3–x were explored
using a first-principles cluster expansion. The most stable composition
at 0 K is SiB2.5, which however is unstable with respect
to the decomposition β-SiB3 + Si. Modeling of the
configurational and vibrational entropies suggests that α-SiB3–x only becomes more stable than β-SiB3 at temperatures above its decomposition into SiB6 and Si. Hence, we conclude that α-SiB3–x is metastable at all temperatures. Density functional
theory electronic structure calculations yield band gaps of similar
size for electron-precise α-SiB2.5 and β-SiB3, whereas α-SiB3 represents a p-type conductor.

1 Introduction
The semiconducting α-rhombohedral phase of boron (α-B12) is parent to a family of refractory materials—sometimes
referred to as “α-B12 derived icosahedral
boron-rich solids”1—which
include B4C, B6O, B6P, B6S, B6As, B13N2, B6Se,
and SiB3.2−6 Besides a high thermal stability, these materials possess a low
mass density, extreme hardness, chemical inertness, and variable semiconductor
properties.7−10 α-B12-derived solids have been intensively investigated
not only for their useful materials properties but also for their
unusual structures and “electron-deficient” chemical
bonding.11−13 The majority of compounds have homogeneity ranges,
especially with respect to the nonboron component.2,3 This
work deals with the representative SiB3, which, as we will
outline below, assumes a special role.

The most essential features
of α-B12-derived materials
are summarized in Figure 1. In the α-B12 structure (space group R3̅m, shown in Figure 1a,b), B12 icosahedra are oriented
with their threefold rotational axis along the body diagonal of the
rhombohedral unit cell (or along the c axis when
referring to hexagonal axes) and arranged as in a cubic close packing
(ccp).14 Boron atoms occupy two sites which
are distinguished as polar, Bp, and equatorial, Be. The former are situated on opposite triangles along the threefold
direction, whereas equatorial ones form a puckered hexagon ring (i.e.,
represent the “waist” of icosahedra). The bonding situation
of α-B12 is easily rationalized by employing established
electron-counting schemes.15−18 Between close-packed layers, neighboring icosahedra
are connected via terminal (exo) bonds involving two Bp atoms, whereas within-layers icosahedra are linked via 3c2e bonds
involving the Be atoms. The different bonding motifs (B12 skeleton, terminal 2c2e, and intralayer 3c2e) are well reflected
in the distribution of involved B–B interatomic distances:
those range from 1.75 to 1.81 Å for skeleton bonded atoms within
clusters and are 1.67 and 2.01 Å for 2c2e and 3c2e connected
atoms, respectively.14

Figure 1 Crystal structure of
rhombohedral α-B12 and its
(major) “icosahedral boron-rich” derivatives. In the
α-B12 structure, icosahedral B12 units
are arranged as in a cubic close packing. (a) Arrangement of B12 units within a close-packed layer. Intralayer 3c2e bonds
involving equatorial B atoms are indicated as pink triangles. (b)
Rhombohedral unit cell of α-B12 with stacking of
layers indicated. Terminal (exo) 2c2e bonds connecting icosahedra
between layers are depicted as yellow lines. (c) In the binary/ternary
derivatives, interlayer 3c2e bonds are replaced by terminal 2c2e bonds
to interstitial atoms. From left to right: B4C ([B11Cp]−[CBC]+), B6P ([B12]2–[P2]2+), B6O ([B12]2–[O+]2). The center of the interstitial atoms corresponds
to the location of the octahedral void in the cubic close packing.

The structures of α-B12-derived
icosahedral boron-rich
solids arise when inserting three-atom chains CBC or NBN (leading
to B4C19 and B13N2,20 respectively) or pairs of atoms
(dumbbells) at the position of the octahedral voids in the ccp arrangement
of icosahedra, and orienting them along [111]r/[001]h (Figure 1c).2,3 This replaces the intralayer 3c2e bonds between Be atoms
by 2c2e exo-links between Be and an atom of the inserted
entity, whereas the exo-links between Bp atoms of neighboring
icosahedra between layers are retained. Substitution of B atoms within
B12 units occurs rarely and is mostly seen with boron carbides,
where it affects the polar position. B4C may be written
as CBC(B11Cp).21 Optimum
electron counts for the various materials (yielding electron-precise
semiconducting phases) follow from the optimum electron count of an
all exo-linked icosahedral cluster (i.e., 13 electron pairs for skeleton
bonding and 12 electrons for exo-bonding),15,18 which may be expressed as, e.g., (CBC)+(B11Cp)−, (P2)2+B122–, and (O+)2B122– (cf. Figure 1c). However, as initially mentioned, α-B12-derived materials are rarely stoichiometric with respect
to the electron-precise composition. Compositional deviations frequently
originate from disorder within the three-atom/dumbbell entities, according
to B12(B1–xXx) for, e.g., X = P, S, Se or B12Y2–x for, e.g., Y = As, P, O,2,3 in addition to the above-mentioned substitution of Bp by Cp. Although phase relations may be complicated, homogeneity
ranges remain rather narrow and semiconductor properties are maintained.3,22

SiB3 represents a special case among α-B12-derived materials. Although rhombohedral SiB3 has been
known for a long time—first reports date back to Moissan and
Stock23—its composition is still
discussed controversially and will be hereafter referred to as SiB3–x. In contrast to B4C,
the larger size of Si permits only the presence of Si dumbbells in
the octahedral voids. This is analogous to B6P4—but in contrast to B6P (Figure 1c), an electron-precise
composition (conforming to a semiconductor phase) will require the
substitution of a substantial concentration of B within icosahedra.
Early single-crystal diffraction work indicated that the preferred
location for this substitution is, as for B4C, the polar
site.24 The electron-precise composition
Si2(B10Sip2), i.e., SiB2.5, however, does not seem to be realized. Thus, in contrast
to other α-B12-derived materials, SiB3–x attains a composition that deviates considerably
from the optimum electron count and, accordingly, this phase should
be truly metallic. Obviously, substitution of Si for boron atoms on
the polar site implies highly strained icosahedra. This follows simply
from a comparison of atomic radii, which are rather similar for B
and C (0.82 and 0.77 Å, respectively), whereas there is a large
disparity in size with respect to the third period element Si (1.11
Å).25 As seen in the molecular analogues,
such strained icosahedra are clearly unfavorable: There are numerous
derivatives of icosahedral dicarboranes (C2B10H12), where H can be substituted for, e.g., alkyl, acyl,
or halogens. Icosahedral dicarboranes exist in all three isomers (ortho,
meta, para) and the C2B10 skeleton may be stable
up to 600 °C.26 In contrast, icosahedral
disilaboranes are only known as air-sensitive 1,2-diphenyl-, 1,2-methylphenyl-,
and 1,2-dimethyl-ortho-disilaborane.27 The latter, (CH3)2Si2B10H10, was discovered first.28 The actual composition of SiB3–x will represent a balance of the two extremes SiB2.5 (electron-precise with all bonding states occupied but highly strained
B10Sip2 icosahedra) and SiB6 (partially empty valence band but unstrained B12 icosahedra).
In this context, it is interesting to note that recently a new boron
carbide phase B2.5C was predicted, which is more stable
than B4C at high-pressure conditions.29 The structure of B2.5C corresponds to electron-precise
C2(B10Cp2). Furthermore,
it has been suggested that microalloying B4C with silicon—where
CBC units are (partially) replaced by Si2 dumbbells—could
afford a ternary material with decisively improved ductility.30 And it has been shown that also hypothetical
Si2(B10Sip2) displays
improved ductility with respect to B4C.31

Apart from its uncertain composition, also formation
conditions
and the thermal stability of SiB3–x are poorly understood. It seems to be clear that above 1300 °C,
SiB3–x decomposes to orthorhombic
SiB6 and Si32,33 and recent phase diagrams specify
1270 °C as the peritectoid decomposition temperature.34−36 However, the decomposition of SiB3–x has also been reported at temperatures below 1250 °C,37 whereas at the same time, significant rates
of formation would require temperatures above 1250 °C.38 Further, single crystals of SiB3–x used in structural studies were obtained from Si-rich
melts for which temperatures had to exceed 1400 °C.24 Aselage then put forward the interesting proposal
that SiB3–x is merely metastable,
which could indeed explain
the seemingly contradictory reports on synthesis conditions and thermal
stability.39 To this day, the thermodynamic
properties of rhombohedral SiB3–x have remained nebulous. Also, SiB3–x lacks conclusive characterization of its physical properties.

It then came as a surprise when in 2003 Salvador et al. reported
a strictly ordered and stoichiometric phase SiB3, which
they termed β-SiB3 (and subsequently, rhombohedral
SiB3 was named α-SiB3).40 β-SiB3 was obtained from a metal (Ga)
flux synthesis at comparatively low synthesis temperatures (850–1000
°C). The orthorhombic crystal structure of β-SiB3, shown in Figure 2, consists of layers of interconnected B12 icosahedra
parallel to the ac plane, which are stacked, but
not bonded, in the b direction. Linear zigzag chains
of Si4 rhomboid rings are embedded between these layers.
Each Si4 ring connects to eight B12 units and,
as a consequence, each Si atom attains a peculiar fivefold coordination
by three Si and two B atoms. All B atoms in an icosahedron attain
an exo-bond, either to B atoms of neighboring icosahedra in the ac plane or to Si atoms of neighboring Si4 rings.
The bonding properties of β-SiB3 have been qualitatively
rationalized by assigning each (all-exo-bonded) B12 unit
a charge of −2 and, accordingly, each rhomboid ring Si4 a charge of +2.41 Bonding in nonclassical
Si42+ was then described by a simple 4c4e model.41−43 According to this bonding model, β-SiB3 is electron-precise,
which is in agreement with its semiconductor properties (i.e., a band
gap of 2 eV).40 Thus, the structural properties
of β-SiB3, and presumably also the physical and electronic
ones, are radically different from α-SiB3–x.

Figure 2 Crystal structure of orthorhombic β-SiB3. B and
Si atoms are depicted as green and red circles, respectively. Zigzag
chains of rhomboid Si4 rings are indicated by red bonds.
Terminal 2c2e (exo) bonds between icosahedra and between B and Si
atoms are drawn in gray and yellow, respectively.

Salvador et al. argued that a liquid Ga environment was necessary
to stabilize β-SiB3, which apparently is not accessible
by conventional synthetic routes (as used for the synthesis of α-SiB3–x).40 Later
studies showed that also liquid In and Sn environments promote the
formation of β-SiB3,44 and it was proposed that to obtain β-SiB3, the
formation of α-SiB3–x had
to be completely bypassed.45 Generally,
metal fluxes may allow for kinetic control in the synthesis of solids45 and/or access to low-temperature modifications
for which rates of formation can be insignificant when using solid
reactants. Thus, one may suspect that β-SiB3 represents
a metastable and/or low-temperature form of SiB3. However,
a transition from β-SiB3 to α-SiB3–x has never been observed. Instead, β-SiB3 has been shown to be extraordinarily temperature-stable (refractory).40 So, how does then β-SiB3 (thermodynamically)
relate to α-SiB3–x, and—given
the long history of B–Si investigations—why has it not
been observed earlier? In this work, we establish the formation conditions
for both α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 from binary elemental mixtures. We further bracket the composition
of α-SiB3–x and show that
this phase is metastable with respect to β-SiB3 at
high temperatures.

2 Methods
2.1 Synthesis
Unless otherwise stated,
starting materials for synthesis were amorphous boron (95–97%,
ABCR GmbH (AB114507), <1 μm average particle size), silicon
powder with an average particle size 8 μm (99.995%, ABCR GmbH,
in the following, we denote this material as “micron-Si”),
and silicon powder with an average particle size <50 nm (98%, Alfa
Aesar; in the following, we denote this material as “nano-Si”).
Before use, micron-Si was ground in an agate mortar, after which the
particle size distribution was 1–5 μm. Boron was treated
overnight in dynamic vacuum (10–4–10–5 mbar) at 900 °C. All precursors were stored
and handled for sample preparation in an Ar-filled glovebox. BN crucibles
[8.5 mm outside diameter (OD), 6.5 mm inside diameter (ID), 10 mm
height] or boron nitride powder (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), both used for
confining reaction mixtures, were also degassed in a dynamic vacuum
before use. Niobium ampoules (10 mm OD, 9 mm ID, about 50 mm length)
were cleaned with dilute HCl and acetone before use.

2.1.1 Synthesis of Polycrystalline Samples
For a typical
synthesis, boron and silicon starting material were
intimately but gently mixed in an agate mortar, avoiding grinding.
Considered molar proportions Si/B ranged from 1:1 to 1:4. Mixtures
were subsequently pressed into pellets with 4 or 6 mm diameter. For
this, the highest pressure tolerable with the pressing tool was applied
(∼250 MPa). The height of a pellet was between 1 and 1.5 mm,
the weight of 4 mm pellets was around 15 mg, and that of 6 mm pellets
about 40 mg. It is important to mention that reproducible results
could only be obtained with well-pressed and homogenously dense pellets
and using starting materials from the same batch. One or several pellets
were placed in a BN crucible, which in turn was inserted in a niobium
ampule. Alternatively, a Nb ampule was filled with slightly compacted
BN powder into which Si–B pellets were embedded. Nb ampules
were sealed shut by arc welding, removed from the glovebox, and then
placed in a high-temperature furnace, in which they were heated in
an Ar atmosphere. Target temperatures were in a range of 1100–1300
°C, and dwelling times varied from several hours to several days,
up to 2 weeks. The typically applied heating rate was 200 °C/h.
After dwelling, the samples were cooled by switching off the furnace.
To achieve complete and precise control of the sample/reaction temperature,
systematic investigations were performed in a Netzsch STA 449 F1 Jupiter
thermal analysis apparatus using a thermogravimetric analysis sample
rod. For this, 4 mm pellets of reaction mixture were placed in polycrystalline
sapphire crucibles (5 mm ID, 6 mm OD, 5 mm height) from CoorsTek,
which were covered with a thin corundum lid. Heating ramps were 10
°C/min. All Jupiter experiments were performed using a continuous
Ar gas flow (5 N, 85 mL/min) and in the presence of an oxygen getter
(Zr metal). Pellets were broken into pieces after sintering, which
were either ground for powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) or used for
scanning electron microscopy analysis.

2.1.2 Synthesis
of α-SiB3–x Single-Crystal
Samples
Boron and silicon
starting material were intimately mixed in a molar proportion Si/B
= 10:1, and the mixture was pressed into pellets (6 mm diameter, height
2–3 mm). Several pellets (batch size, 0.5–2.0 g) were
placed in a BN crucible/embedded in BN powder and then sealed in a
Nb ampule. Batch sizes amounted between 0.5 and 2.0 g. Nb ampules
were placed in a high-temperature furnace and heated in Ar atmosphere
at a rate of 200 °C/h to 1435 °C, which is slightly above
the melting point of Si (1414 °C). After equilibrating the sample
at this temperature for 1 h, the furnace was turned off and the ampule
was cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the ampule was cut open
and the Si–B ingot was recovered and cleaned from the surrounding
BN (if present). The ingot was crushed into coarse pieces (about 1–2
mm), and excess Si was removed with a mixture of deionized water,
concentrated HNO3, and concentrated HF (volume proportions,
3:2:2). The remainder consisted mostly of black α-SiB3−x crystals, with sizes between several μm to
several hundred μm. The acid mixture was decanted and the crystals
washed with water (3×) and ethanol. The crystals were subsequently
used for single-crystal X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), and Raman spectroscopy investigations.

2.1.3 Synthesis at High Pressures
High-pressure
syntheses were performed in a 6–8 Walker-type multi-anvil high-pressure
device using an 18/12 assembly developed by Stoyanov et al.46 Powders of crystalline β-boron (99.95%,
ChemPur) and silicon (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed with molar
ratios Si/B = 1:2 and 1:3 and placed inside hexagonal boron nitride
capsules in an Ar-filled glovebox. The total amount of starting materials
mixture varied between 65 and 120 mg. To prepare the high-pressure
cell assembly, BN sample capsules were positioned in a graphite furnace,
which in turn was placed together with a zirconia thermal insulating
sleeve (0.57 mm wall thickness, 7.77 mm OD, 10.80 mm length) in a
magnesia octahedron with 18 mm edge length. Sample capsules were pressurized
at a rate of about 0.5 GPa/h with 25 mm Toshiba grade E tungsten carbide
cubes truncated to 12 mm edge length. After reaching the target pressure
(either 5.5 or 8 GPa), the samples were heated to a target temperature
between 900 and 1200 °C within an hour. The temperature was monitored
by a type-C thermocouple (W5%Re–W26%Re) close to the sample.
After applying the dwelling time, the samples were quenched by turning
off the power to the furnace (quench rate ∼50 °C/min and
at approximately constant pressure). Afterward, the pressure was released
at a rate of approximately 0.5 GPa/h. The recovered, cylindrically
shaped, sample was crushed and coarsely ground. Excess Si was removed
by treating the ground samples twice with hot NaOH solution (20%,
6 h with stirring) and then with HCl and aqua regia. This procedure
yielded crystalline SiB3 samples with <5 wt % elemental
Si impurity.

2.2 Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) Analysis
PXRD patterns were collected on two PANalytical
X’Pert PRO
diffractometers, using Cu Kα1 and Cu Kα radiation,
respectively, at room temperature and in reflection mode. Powder samples
were spread onto zero-background Si plates, and the patterns were
recorded in 2θ, with a step size of about 0.015° for patterns
used for phase analysis and about 0.007° for patterns used for
Rietveld refinements. Phase/weight fractions were estimated roughly
using the HighScore Plus v3.0e software from Panalytical B.V., together
with data from the ICDD PDF-4+ v4.18.0.2 database, or determined more
accurately using the Rietveld method through the program package FULLPROF.47 Typically, the Rietveld refinements proceeded
by first modeling the background by linear interpolation using a set
of refinable height background points, refining unit cell parameters,
and sample displacement together with scale factors, and then fitting
Bragg reflection profiles by a pseudo-Voigt function (number 7 in
FullProf). Employed structure models were taken from the ICSD database;
α-SiB3–x (space group R3̅m, ICSD no. 28317, ref (24)), β-SiB3 (space group Imma, ICSD no. 412621, ref (40)), and SiB6 (space
group Pnnm, ICSD no. 63554, ref (48)). For α-SiB3–x, an hkl-dependent
broadening with broadening vector [010] significantly improved the
fit. For β-SiB3, a preferred orientation along [010]
was modeled with the March–Dollase function.49

2.3 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) Investigations
SEM investigations comprised morphological
and compositional analysis
[by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy] of sintered pellet
and crystal samples. In addition, the morphology and particle size
distribution of the starting materials was examined (Figures S16 and S18, Supporting Information). For studying
sintered pellets, a piece of sample was affixed to an Al holder with
melting glue (mp 150 °C) and conducting graphite paste was added
to ensure electric conduction from sample to holder. Polishing was
first done mechanically with SiC paper to create a flat surface, which
was followed by Ar+-beam cross section polishing (CP) in
a CP-09010 instrument from JEOL. CP was performed at a 90° angle,
employing a shield from the manufacturer, and using 5.5 kV acceleration
voltage for the Ar+-ion gun. For studying crystal samples,
crystals were selected under an optical microscope and placed on the
flat surface of an Al sample holder using a droplet of acetone to
affix the crystals.

All SEM investigations were performed in
an SEM JSM-7000F from JEOL that is equipped with an l-N2 cooled Inca energy-dispersive detector from Oxford Instruments.
For EDX analysis, a low acceleration voltage of 5 kV was employed
to decrease the characteristic X-ray generation volume and thereby
receive better resolution and more reliable EDX data from the low Z elements (i.e., boron) in the sample. Images were generated
using information from secondary electrons or backscattered electrons
at a working distance of 15 mm and at a medium high probe current
setting (7 in the instrument settings). EDX probing was performed
at a work distance of 10 mm with a high probe current setting (14
in the instrument settings). The specific difficulties in obtaining
quantitative analysis of Si/B ratios with EDX are discussed in the Supporting Information.

2.4 Single-Crystal
X-ray Diffraction (SC-XRD)
Analysis
2.4.1 Data Collection
The detailed SC-XRD
analysis described in Section 3.2.1 refers to a single crystal with dimensions 0.125 ×
0.137 × 0.155 mm3, which was mounted on a micro-loop
using perfluorinated polyalkylether. Data were collected on a Bruker
SMART diffractometer using a microfocus X-ray source (λ = 0.56087
Å) equipped with mirror-optics and an APEXII charge-coupled device
(CCD) detector at room temperature. To resolve the disorder of the
structure, data of high resolution and high quality are needed. Intensity
data were therefore collected using a total of 14 ω-scans with
360/600 frames per scan and a frame width of 0.5/0.3°. The lower
frame width was only used for the maximum 2θ offset. The detector
distance was 4 cm, and the detector offsets were 2θ = 0°
(6×), 2θ = 34° (3×), and 2θ = 68°
(5×). A wide range of exposure times between 3 and 135 s had
to be employed, mainly due to the rapid decay of scattering intensity
with increasing scattering angle.

2.4.2 Data
Reduction
Crystal data for
α-SiB3–x (SiB2.64(2)): Mr = 54.45, a = 6.3282(1)
Å, c = 12.7283(3) Å, V = 441.43(2) Å3; trigonal space group R3̅m (#166); Z = 12; F(000) = 314.0; ρcalc = 2.458 g/cm3; μ(Ag Kα) = 0.44 mm–1. The
frames were integrated with the Bruker SAINT50 V8.34A software package using the narrow-frame algorithm, and the
unit cell was determined from a total of 9923 reflections. A multiscan
absorption correction (Tmin = 0.91 and Tmax = 0.95) as well as the interframe scaling
and an error model was then applied using SADABS v2014/2.51 The internal agreement factor was Rint = 0.0363 for a total of 27 377 reflections
(1311 unique). The data set provided a completeness of 99.54% (|h| ≤ 17, |k| ≤ 17, |l| ≤ 35) and a redundancy of 20.9 for the complete
data 6.38° < θ < 105.16° (dmin = 0.353 Å, sin(θmax)/λ
< 1.416 Å–1). Subsequent refinements were
performed with the program package JANA2006.52

2.5 Spectroscopic Investigations
2.5.1 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra
on α-B12, α-SiB3–x, and β-SiB3 crystals were measured using
a LabRAM HR 800 spectrometer equipped with an 800 mm focal length
spectrograph and an air-cooled, back-thinned CCD detector. The spatial
resolution of the instrument is specified as ∼1 μm. The
crystal samples were placed on a glass slide and excited with a double-frequency
Nd:YAG laser (532 nm). Spectra were collected at room temperature
with an exposure time of 300 s and using a grating of 1800 lines/mm.
For disordered α-SiB3–x,
the laser power was varied from very low to very high. This did not
lead to any notable changes in the spectra. All spectra were calibrated
and normalized. α-B12 was synthesized from crystalline
β-boron in a Pt-flux at 5.5 GPa and 1000 °C using a 6–8
Walker-type multi-anvil high-pressure device (see Section 2.1 for details). The dwell
time was 15 min.

2.5.2 Magic Angle Spinning
(MAS) NMR Spectroscopy
The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum
of a powder sample containing
α-SiB3–x and nonreacted Si
was acquired on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer operating at
a magnetic field of 14.1 T (119.22 MHz 29Si Larmor frequency),
with a 4 mm HXY probe. The acquisition was carried out at 12 kHz MAS
using a single radio frequency (rf) excitation pulse of 1.4 μs
and 60 Hz nutation frequency, corresponding to a ∼30°
flip angle. A total of 160 signal transients with a 600 s recycle
delay were collected. Neat tetramethylsilane was used for chemical
shift referencing and rf power calibration.

2.6 Computational Investigations
2.6.1 First-Principles
Calculations
Total
energies of α-SiB3–x (x = 0.5, 0.18, 0, −0.2, −0.67) and β-SiB3 and of the elemental phases α-B12 and α-Si,
were calculated within the density functional theory (DFT)53,54 and the projector augmented wave method,55 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).56,57 The generalized gradient approximation, developed by Perdew, Burke,
and Ernzerhof,58 was employed to account
for electron exchange–correlation effects. The energy cutoff
for plane waves, included in the expansion of wave functions, was
set to 500 eV, and a 9 × 9 × 9 Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh59 was chosen for
the Brillouin zone integration. The calculated total energies were
converged within an accuracy of 1 meV/atom with respect to both the
energy cutoff and the number of k-points. During
structural optimizations, all atomic coordinates, volume, and cell
shape of the considered phases were allowed to be relaxed. To derive
the total electronic density of states (DOS), the tetrahedron method
for the Brillouin zone integration was employed.60

2.6.2 Cluster Expansion (CE)
of α-SiB3–x
To search
for the energetically
stable composition and relevant atomic configurations of disordered
α-SiB3–x, the cluster expansion
(CE) method was employed. According to the CE formalism,61 the total energy (E) of any
crystalline solid that is strictly a function of the atomic arrangement
on a lattice [i.e., a so-called atomic configuration (σ)] can
be formally expanded into a sum over correlation functions ζf(n)(σ) of
specific n-site figures f with the
corresponding effective cluster interactions (ECIs) Vf(n) 1  The factor mf(n) is defined as the multiplicity of specific n-site figures f, normalized to the number
of atom sites N within the corresponding atomic configuration
σ. To describe any atom configuration σ of α-SiB3–x, the spin variable σi is assigned to take on a value of +1 or of
−1, if the lattice site i is occupied by a B or by a Si atom,
respectively. As a result, any atomic configuration σ of α-SiB3–x can be uniquely specified by a
set of spin variables {σi}, and
the correlation function ζf(n) can subsequently be determined by the
products of the spin variables σi 2  where the sum of the products in the parentheses
runs over all symmetrically equivalent clusters, α ∈ f. Although the expansion, expressed in eq 1, is analytically exact in the limit
of inclusion of all possible figures f, it must be
truncated for practical purposes. To perform the CE, the MIT Ab initio
Phase Stability (MAPS) code,62 as implemented
in the alloy-theoretical automated toolkit,63 was used to truncate the expansion in eq 1 and to determine the ECIs in such a way that eq 1 returns the total energies E(σ) of α-SiB3–x as close to those obtained from first-principles calculations
as possible for all σ included in the expansion. In the present
investigation, the CE method was employed to determine the ground-state
atomic configurations of α-SiB3–x of different compositions, in particular α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3. Because of strong experimental evidence,24 only atoms on the polar site were considered
in the CE.

2.6.3 Phonon Calculations
The total and
partial phonon density of states (pDOS) of β-SiB3 and of the most stable configurations of α-SiB2.5 (as derived from the CE method) were obtained at the level of the
harmonic approximation using the finite-displacement method, as implemented
in the PHONOPY package for phonon calculations.64,65 Force constants were calculated within 2 × 2 × 2 orthorhombic
(triclinic) primitive unit cells using the Parlinski–Li–Kawazoe
method with an atomic displacement of 0.01 Å.66 To ensure the convergence of the phonon calculations, the
supercells of α-SiB2.5 and β-SiB3 were fully relaxed so that the total forces acting on each atom
within the supercells were less than 10–6 eV/Å. A 35 × 35 × 35 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid was used to sample the supercells for deriving
the phonon frequencies and vibrational free energy as a function of
temperature.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of SiB3: Interplay between
α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3
The initial preparation of a compound SiB3 was reported in 1900,23 but could not
be repeated until 1959–1962, during which several publications
on silicon borides SiB3 and SiB432,37,38,67−70 appeared. These, and all later reports on rhombohedral SiB3 and SiB4, refer to the same phase, i.e., α-SiB3–x. Knarr32 and Brosset and Magnusson37 found that
mixtures of silicon and boron heated between 1200 and 1380 °C
first produced α-SiB3–x,
which then slowly decomposed into orthorhombic SiB6 plus
Si. At the same time, pure samples of α-SiB3–x, or mixtures of α-SiB3–x and SiB6, appeared unchanged after annealing
at 1260 °C.32 α-SiB3–x has been assumed to undergo a peritectoid (solid
state) decomposition (into SiB6 and Si) at temperatures
between 127032 and 1340 °C.71 Most recent Si–B phase diagrams specify
1270 °C as the decomposition temperature (and assign a very narrow
homogeneity range to α-SiB3–x, x ≈ 0.1).34−36 With respect to the
synthesis of α-SiB3–x, Colton
reported that the rates of both formation and subsequent decomposition
increase as temperature increased from 1250 to 1350 °C.38 Later, Tremblay and Angers derived “optimum”
synthesis conditions: Rates of formation and decomposition appeared
to be balanced best for T = 1325 °C and t = 5.75 h (referring to synthesis mixtures B/Si = 3.5).72

An important step was the crystal structure
determination of α-SiB3–x by Magnusson and Brosset (MB),24 which
revealed (i) the close relationship of α-SiB3–x to rhombohedral B4C and B6P and (ii) a rather Si-rich composition, i.e., SiB2.89. Interestingly, the single crystals used for the structural study
were prepared from molten silicon–boron mixtures, i.e., at
temperatures above 1400 °C. In 1998, Aselage summarized splendidly
the state of affairs and arrived at the conclusion that α-SiB3–x is actually not thermodymically
stable. Instead, its formation is kinetically driven and α-SiB3–x would form only under conditions
of boron supersaturation of a silicon-rich solid or liquid solution.39 The salient question is whether Aselage’s
insightful analysis is compatible with, or how it possibly connects
to, the later discovery of β-SiB3 from molten metal
flux synthesis. In the following, we describe our attempts to uncover
the interplay between α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 in the binary Si–B system by
applying different synthesis strategies.

Reproducible results
for the synthesis of SiB3 from
mixtures of elemental boron and silicon required tightly pressed and
homogeneously dense pellets as well as precise control of the sample
temperature. Therefore, we performed investigations into reaction
temperatures and times in the well-controlled environment of a thermal
analysis apparatus. Figure 3 shows results for mixtures of nano-Si and amorphous boron
with ratios 1:3 and 1:4, which were reacted at temperatures between
1150 and 1225 °C.

Figure 3 Summary of the synthesis results using nano-Si and amorphous
boron
as starting materials with Si/B ratios 1:3 (a) and 1:4 (b). The relative
fractions of unreacted Si, α-SiB3–x, and β-SiB3 are presented as pie charts.
The asterisks mark the presence of SiB6 phase in products.

Focusing first on the 1:3 reaction mixtures (Figure 3a), rates of formation
are very low at 1150
°C. No silicon boride products were observed after 6 and 16 h.
However, it was notable that amorphous boron started converting into
crystalline β-boron with some Si incorporated (i.e., SiB36).73 This conversion was also
observed for pure amorphous boron starting material in a control experiment
(see Figure S17, Supporting Information).
After 40 h, about 25% of Si had reacted with α-SiB3–x. At 1175 °C, rates appeared significantly increased.
Already after 16 h, the product contained about 25% α-SiB3–x, and after 40 h, virtually all
Si had been consumed. The 40 h product corresponded to ∼90%
α-SiB3–x and, surprisingly,
∼10% β-SiB3. The product mixture after 80
h showed a slightly increased fraction of β-SiB3.
At 1200 °C, reaction rates were increased again significantly.
After 6 and 16 h, a 25 and 70% conversion to α-SiB3–x was obtained, respectively. The product after 40
h was essentially the same as that obtained at 1175 °C after
40 h. Reactions at 1225 °C resulted in more than 50% conversion
after 6 h and an essentially phase-pure α-SiB3–x sample after 16 h. The PXRD pattern of this sample
has subsequently been used for Rietveld refinement of α-SiB3–x (cf. Figure 8, see later discussion). The 40 h experiment
produced largely SiB6.

For 1:4 reaction mixtures
(Figure 3b), we observed
an increased reaction rate compared
to 1:3 mixtures. Complete consumption of Si was observed at 1225 °C
after only 6 h, at 1200 °C after 16 h, and at 1150 °C after
40 h. At the same time, it is clear that excess B promotes the formation
of β-SiB3, which was obtained in substantial amounts
(25–50%) at 1150–1200 °C after 40 h. Figure 4 illustrates with PXRD patterns
the evolution of the product with time at 1175 °C. We observed
significant formation of SiB6 at 1225 °C after 16
h.

Figure 4 PXRD patterns (Cu Kα1 radiation) of products from
Si/B 1:4 reaction mixtures after dwelling at 1175 °C for various
times (cf. Figure 3b). The position of diffraction lines for α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 is indicated by the
black and red markers, respectively. The 2θ range containing
pronounced reflections from SiB36 (β-boron structure)
is marked in gray.

We summarize the results
from the nano-Si/amorphous boron reactions
as follows: α-SiB3–x formation
takes place already at 1150 °C, although at low rate. Comparatively
small increases of T give large effects on the rate
of formation. At temperatures above 1200 °C, the formation of
SiB6 was observed, which is in agreement with earlier reports.32,37 Importantly, β-SiB3 can be obtained from binary
reactions mixtures and was consistently seen after 40 h reaction time.
We mention briefly the results obtained from micron-Si/amorphous boron
and nano-Si/crystalline boron reactions (details can be found in Supporting InformationFigures S1–S9). Increasing the particle size of Si reduced the
rate of α-SiB3–x formation,
whereas the usage of crystalline boron seemed to increase rates. This
perhaps unexpected finding may relate to the sluggish onset of reactions
with nano-Si/amorphous mixtures at 1150 and 1175 °C, during which
amorphous boron partially crystallized before SiB3–x formation was observed (after 40 and 16 h, respectively).

We confirmed the earlier observed relative ease of formation of
α-SiB3–x. It appears that
the particle size of Si is an important parameter in this respect,
as reactions with nano-Si could be performed at unprecedented low
temperatures (1150 °C). Using nano-Si, we find that the optimum T,t conditions for achieving roentgenographically
pure samples of α-SiB3–x is
sintering at 1225 °C for 16 h (referring to tightly pressed pellets
with ratio 1:3 of the starting materials specified). We also mention
that it is possible to exploit the comparatively fast kinetics of
α-SiB3–x formation for the
simultaneous synthesis and consolidation of α-SiB3–x specimens in a spark plasma sintering device and
refer for further details to Supporting Information (Figure S12).

According to Aselage,
the reaction of silicon and boron (to yield
α-SiB3–x) proceeds by the
following sequence. First, boron diffuses into silicon, ultimately
reaching saturation. (Note that boron diffuses rapidly in Si,74,75 but the solubility of B in Si is very low, 0.2% at 1000 °C.34−36) Second, under conditions of boron supersaturation, α-SiB3–x nucleates and begins to grow. This
hypothesis is supported by our finding that the particle size of Si
has a large effect on the reaction rate. Figure 5a shows the SEM image of a nano-Si/B = 1:4
pellet after sintering at 1175 °C for 16 h, and Figure 5b shows a micron-Si/B = 1:4
pellet after sintering at 1200 °C for 24 h. In the former sample,
nano-Si appears to be agglomerated to larger, 0.1–1 μm,
particles and amorphous boron partially crystallized to SiB36 (β-boron) crystals with sizes of several micrometers (in agreement
with the PXRD pattern, cf. Figure 4). α-SiB3, which according to PXRD
is present at a 20% level (with respect to Si, cf. Figure 3b), is seen as rather irregular
(“wormlike”) particles with sizes around 1 μm.
The SEM image of the latter sample shows clearly Si particles with
their original size (1–5 μm) and shape and possessing
a boron-enriched rim. This rim may be envisioned to develop and host
α-SiB3–x nuclei, which subsequently
grow to wormlike crystallites. Upon growth, α-SiB3–x crystallites detach from the surface of a Si particle,
which eventually gets consumed.

Figure 5 SEM backscattered electron images of reacted
pellets revealing
various stages of α-SiB3–x/β-SiB3 formation. For a homogenously dense sample,
areas with bright and dark contrast correspond to Si- and B-rich compositions,
respectively. (a) Nano-Si/B = 1:4 at 1175 °C after 16 h: onset
of α-SiB3–x formation. White,
dark, and medium gray areas correspond to agglomerated nano-Si, crystallized
amorphous boron, and irregularly shaped, wormlike, α-SiB3–x particles, respectively. (b) Micron-Si/B
= 1:4 at 1200 °C after 24 h: Si particles with a B-saturated
rim and irregularly shaped, wormlike, α-SiB3–x particles. (c) Nano-Si/B = 1:3 at 1200 °C after
40 h: roentgenographically pure α-SiB3–x sample, consisting of larger crystals (brighter) and smaller
particles (darker). Areas in between α-SiB3–x crystals and particles appear darker due to a lower
sample density. (d) Nano-Si/B = 1:4 at 1175 °C after 40 h: the
sample constitutes β-SiB3 crystals, irregularly shaped
α-SiB3–x particles, and crystallized
excess boron (dark gray areas). The smaller inset shows a β-SiB3 crystal with boron-rich inclusions; the larger inset shows
an optical micrograph of the cross section polished sample. The reddish
β-SiB3 crystals are clearly visible.

Figure 5c
shows
the SEM image of a nano-Si/B = 1:3 pellet after sintering at 1200
°C for 40 h. According to PXRD (Figure 3a), this sample corresponded to almost pure
α-SiB3–x. At these conditions,
α-SiB3–x was afforded as
facetted crystals with sizes of up to 10 μm. At the same time,
one can note more irregularly shaped crystals with a smaller size.
Interestingly, their different contrast suggests a different composition,
with the larger crystals more rich in Si (i.e., larger crystals appear
brighter in the micrograph). A closer look at the larger crystals
reveals heterogeneities in the presence of boron-rich inclusions and
sporadic Si nanocrystals. We infer that the crystal growth of α-SiB3–x is accompanied with a change to
a more Si-rich composition. This is corroborated by single-crystal
diffraction studies and discussed in more detail in Section 3.2. It is not clear whether
sizable (>10 μm) homogeneous α-SiB3–x crystals can be grown in solid-state reaction mixtures.
On the other hand, Magnusson and Brosset discovered that α-SiB3–x crystals can be grown in Si–B
melts using excess of Si,24,37 i.e., at temperatures
considerably above the decomposition into SiB6 and Si.
Here, one can think that—analogous to α-SiB3–x formation from boron-supersaturated Si particles
in the solid state—α-SiB3–x nuclei precipitate from boron-supersaturated Si-rich liquid
solutions by following Ostwald’s rule of stages (which postulates
that a supersaturated system does not spontaneously transform into
the most stable of all possible states (i.e., SiB6 + Si)
but rather into the state which is the next more stable compared to
the supersaturated state). In our synthesis of α-SiB3–x crystal samples (according to Magnusson and Brosset),
we used a Si/B ratio close to the eutectic composition (∼92
atom % of Si) and heated to temperatures just slightly above the eutectic
temperature (∼1385 °C).34−36 Melts were equilibrated
for a relatively short time (1 h), to minimize decomposition into
SiB6, after which the sample was cooled by switching off
the furnace. After removal of excess Si, black α-SiB3–x crystals were obtained with sizes from several micrometers
to 200 μm (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 View of α-SiB3–x crystals.
Left: SEM and optical microscopy image (inset) of a selected crystal.
Right: optical microscopy image of a selection of crystals with sizes
around 100 μm.

Sintered reaction pellets
and α-SiB3–x crystals were
subjected to extensive EDX analysis
(see Figures S13–S15, Supporting
Information). Flux-grown crystals showed homogeneous values, 25(1)
atom % Si and 75(1) atom % B, within and between crystal specimens,
which indicates a composition near SiB3, i.e., x ≈ 0. However, as discussed in Section 2.3, Si/B ratios obtained from
EDX cannot be considered accurate due to lack of standards. EDX analysis
of sintered pellets was in addition hampered by the small size and
irregular shape of particles. Backscattered electron images, as shown
in Figure 5, provide
qualitative information on Si/B compositional variations. At the same
time, one has to be aware of the fact that because of the heterogeneous
nature of sintered reaction pellets, contrast variations will also
be caused by density differences between sample areas (cf. Figure 5c).

The oversight
of β-SiB3 as product from binary
reaction mixtures in earlier works is surprising since we could consistently
obtain it irrespective of the choice of Si starting material (nano
or micro) or Si/B ratio (1:3 or 1:4). Most likely, β-SiB3 escaped previous investigations because of the comparatively
low temperatures and long reaction times needed. The evolution of
products from nano-Si/B = 1:4 reaction mixtures at 1175 °C strongly
suggests that β-SiB3 forms from conversion of α-SiB3–x, which is greatly assisted by the
presence of excess B. Accordingly, the reaction α-SiB3–x + xB = β-SiB3 is
comparatively fast, whereas the direct conversion 3/(3 – x)α-SiB3–x = β-SiB3 + xSi, which is assumed to occur in 1:3
reaction mixtures, is slow. Importantly, both conversions occur in
a narrow temperature window, 1175–1200 °C. Nano-Si/B =
1:4 reactions afforded β-SiB3 as 5–10 μm
sized crystallites, which could be easily noted by their characteristic
orange-red color upon inspecting samples in an optical microscope.

Figure 5d shows
the SEM image of a nano-Si/B = 1:4 pellet after sintering at 1175
°C for 40 h. According to PXRD, this sample consisted of approximately
equal proportions α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3. β-SiB3 crystallites,
embedded in a matrix of irregularly shaped α-SiB3–x particles, can be recognized by their sharp edges.
(Note that the growth of α-SiB3–x single crystals is not expected at 1175 °C as this requires
temperatures of 1200 °C and above.) Most of the β-SiB3 crystals actually contain B-rich inclusions, which may be
attributed to a heterogeneous nature of the α-to-β conversion.
Prolonged (several days to weeks) annealing experiments using Si-rich
Si/B mixtures with ratios 1:2 and 1:1 also produced β-SiB3 crystals (see Figures 7 and S10). Therefore, it has to
be assumed that β-SiB3 is a thermodynamically stable
binary compound in the Si–Bi system. We observed that pure
β-SiB3 samples convert to a mixture of SiB6 and Si in a temperature interval 1250–1300 °C. The peritectoid
decomposition is slow and cannot be recognized in a differential thermal
analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiment. Similarly,
and as already noted by Knarr,32 pure samples
of α-SiB3–x appear stable
up to 1250–1300 °C (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

(a) Image of
a micron-Si/B = 1:2 pellet after sintering for 2 weeks at 1200 °C.
The diameter of the pellet is 5 mm. The inset at the top left shows
close-up, highlighting orange, faceted, β-SiB3 crystals
protruding from the pellet surface. The lower inset shows the remainder
of the pellet after dissolution of excess Si with a mixture H2O/HF/HNO3. (b) β-SiB3 sample obtained
from high-pressure synthesis (8 GPa, 1100 °C) using a close to
stoichiometric mixture of crystalline boron and micron-Si (after crushing
and washing the sample with hot 20% NaOH solution).

Salvador et al. showed that the kinetic barriers associated
with
β-SiB3 formation can be overcome by the application
of a molten metal flux.40 Alternatively,
the application of high pressures should minimize barriers associated
with diffusion and thus allow the synthesis of β-SiB3 at much shorter times and lower temperatures. This was then confirmed
in experiments where Si/B reaction mixtures were compressed to 5.5–8
GPa and subsequently heated. α-SiB3 formed quantitatively
after 6 h at the lowest dwelling temperature applied, 900 °C.
Quantitative β-SiB3 formation, presumably through
α-to-β conversion, was obtained at 1100 °C within
12 h. At 1300 °C, the product constituted a mixture of SiB6 and Si.

To conclude this section, we report more detailed
results from
the PXRD analyses of the various samples. Figure 8 shows Rietveld fits to PXRD patterns of samples of β-SiB3 (Figure 8a)
and α-SiB3–x (Figure 8b), and Tables 1 and 2 compile the
results of the refinements. The obtained structure parameters for
β-SiB3 agree well with the initially reported model
of Salvador et al. (based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction data)—and
there is no reason to doubt the established crystal structure of β-SiB3. Intensities in the PXRD pattern of the α-SiB3–x sample decrease rapidly with increasing 2θ,
which is characteristic for disordered materials. At first sight,
the fit to the structure model of Magnusson and Brosset appears reasonable.
The refined occupancy of the polar icosahedral position (∼33%
Si) suggests a composition, which is close to the electron-precise
composition SiB2.5. However, site occupancies from PXRD
data will not be reliable because of the lack of intensity for high-angle
reflections. For the same reason, the refined Uiso values
are 3–4 times larger compared to β-SiB3, whose
PXRD pattern displays more regular intensities for the high-angle
reflections. It is interesting to note that the molar volumes of α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 are
very similar, which implies that β-SiB3 is not a
high-pressure phase in the Si–B system. Table 3 reports the refined lattice parameters of
α-SiB3–x as obtained from
the various synthesis experiments. There are slight variations, possibly
indicating a slightly variable Si/B ratio for polycrystalline α-SiB3–x samples consisting of micron-sized
particles.

1:3 after sintering at 1250 °C for 16 h) (b). See Tables 1 and 2 for the refinement results. Secondary phases included in the refinements
are Si (a, b) and SiB6 (b).

As a result of our synthesis efforts,
we could clarify the interplay
between α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 in the binary B–Si system. α-SiB3–x appears metastable, whereas β-SiB3 represents a stable phase in the B–Si phase diagram. Both
compounds decompose between 1250 and 1300 °C into SiB6 and Si. In the next section, we address the precise composition
and detailed structural properties of disordered α-SiB3–x.

3.2 Structural and Compositional
Characterization
of α-SiB3–x
Although
the structure and composition of β-SiB3 is firmly
established from single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies,40 the same does not hold true for α-SiB3–x. The early structural investigations
by Magnusson and Brosset in 196224 were
based on diffraction data recorded on a Weissenberg camera. Modern
single-crystal diffraction methods allow for vastly superior data
and also provide tools for the analysis of disordered structures.
It is important to note that the refinement of Si–B mixed occupancies
from high-resolution data represents a rather accurate composition
analysis for single crystals since the form factors for Si and B are
sufficiently but not extremely different. For polycrystalline bulk
samples, we will show that 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy provides
the most reliable method for compositional analysis.

3.2.1 SC-XRD Investigation
High-resolution
SC-XRD data were collected from several α-SiB3–x crystals. Particular attention was paid to the possible
presence of superstructure reflections, indicating long-range correlation
of disorder. However, we could not detect superstructure reflections
for any of the investigated crystals. For the initial independent
atom refinement, we employed the structure model of Magnusson and
Brosset (MB), which assumes the polar icosahedral position as mixed
B/Si site and a single isotropic atomic displacement parameter (ADP)
for all atoms (Uiso = 0.0143 Å2). Due to the high resolution of our data, individual and
anisotropic ADPs could be introduced immediately. The position and
ADP of the mixed site was constrained to be equal, and the sum of
occupancies was constrained to unity. The obtained atom position parameters
agreed reasonably with the MB results. The occupancy of the mixed
site, 32.4(6)% Si, corresponds to a composition SiB2.55(3), which is significantly lower than the result of MB (i.e., SiB2.89) and only slightly larger than the ideal, electron-precise
stoichiometry of SiB2.5 with two Si atoms per icosahedron.
However, the MB model is intrinsically flawed with respect to its
interatomic distances. For example, the length of the exo-bond connecting
two icosahedra via polar atoms is 1.632(2) Å, which is actually
shorter than the Bp–Bp exo-distance in
the α-B12 structure, and thus far too short to also
account for a Si–B exo-bond. In addition, the refinement only
converged at a modest R-value of R1 = 10.1%. The residual electron density ranged from −4.5
to 10.2 e/Å3. The maximum in residual electron density
(positive Q-peak) was located inside the icosahedron
at a distance of approximately 0.42 Å to the mixed occupied polar
site.

In the next step, the constraint of equal position was
removed and the boron atom slightly pushed inward the icosahedron,
to provide some bias for the least-squares routine. The refinement
improved with lower R1 and Δρ
(see model 1 in Table 4). The distance between Bp and Sip atoms at the polar position was 0.38 Å, which compared very
well with the original distance of the Q-peak. Although
exo-distances of 1.98 Å between Bp and Sip atoms are reasonable, this model has a different shortcoming: The
site occupancy for Sip increased to 44%, which translates
to an unreasonable composition SiB2.00(1). A large and
negative Q-peak of −4.99 e/Å3 on the Bp atom clearly indicated the flawed occupancy
of this model.

Residual Density Maxima (Full Resolution), and Refined Composition
upon Improving the Structural Model for α-SiB3–x in the Refinement of SC-XRD Data.
model	R1 (%)	Δρ (e/Å3)	refined composition	
MB	10.15	+10.25/–4.41	SiB2.55(3)	
1 (split-position)	6.50	+3.05/–4.99	SiB2.00(1)	
2 (individual-ADP)	2.74	+1.52/–1.14	SiB2.58(1)	
3 (split-Bp)	2.30	+1.42/–0.36	SiB2.61(2)	
4 (anharmonic)	1.98	+0.55/–0.35	SiB2.64(2)	
The crucial hint on how to improve became
evident when removing
the constraint of equal ADPs between Sip and Bp atoms (model 2). The resulting R1 and Δρ values were again reduced significantly
and the composition swung back to SiB2.58(1). The split
Bp–Sip distance decreased to 0.28 Å
and the ADP of the Bp atom almost doubled (Ueq = 0.019 Å2) and became strongly prolate,
with the long axis pointing toward the Sip atom. The largest
negative Q-peak of −1.14 e/Å3 is now located inside the icosahedron close to the Bp atom. This Bp position is now conveniently split into
two individual boron positions Bp,Si and Bp,B (model 3) after which the negative Q-peak disappeared, along with a further reduced R1. (The notation Bp,A has
been chosen to indicate that the boron atom shows a reasonable exo-distance
with respect to an atom A in the neighboring icosahedron.) Note that
the ADP for these split boron atoms was kept equal for stability reasons
and the sum of the occupancies for Bp,Si, Bp,B, and Sip was constrained to unity.

The disorder
at the polar positions is expected to lead to slight
perturbations of the ordered Be and Sid (dumbbell)
atoms, which result in deviations from the harmonic probability density
distribution. In fact, the largest Q-peaks were mainly
located close to the Sid positions, in particular, above
and below the Si dumbbells. In the final step, we therefore added
up to third order (Bp) and up to fourth order (Sid) Gram–Charlier anharmonic ADPs76 (model 4), which was also justified by non-negative
probability distribution maps (see Figure S20, Supporting Information). The refinement of 39 parameters against
1181 reflections [Fo > 3σ(Fo), sin(θmax)/λ <
1.416 Å–1] finally converged at R1 = 1.98%, wR1 = 3.08%, and
a featureless residual density distribution of Δρ = +0.34/–0.27
e/Å3 [sin(θ)/λ < 1.0 Å–1]. Table 5 lists the
atom position parameters for model 4. Anharmonic ADP
values are given as Tables S1 and S2, Supporting
Information. For supporting crystallographic data, see ref (77).

In the following, we discuss model 4,
which is depicted
in Figure 9, in more
detail. The polar position is split into three sites, a Si position
(Sip) and two boron positions (Bp,Si and Bp,B). Their refined occupancies are Sip: 30.8(1)%,
Bp,Si: 31.9(4)% and Bp,B: 37.4(4)%, which yields
the composition SiB2.64(2) for the crystal. Model 4 accounts well for the various interatomic distances in the
disordered structure (see Figure 9b and Table 6). Exo-bonds between polar atoms may occur between Sip and Bp,Si atoms, d = 1.958(2)
Å, as well as between two Bp,B atoms, d = 1.771(4) Å. Note that only a Sip–Bp,Si contact yields a meaningful Si–B interatomic distance
and, therefore, one expects an equal—or very similar—contribution
of these atoms to the polar site. This is indeed the case for model 4. Furthermore, the occupation of the Sip site
is below 1/3, which also supports the model since short Sip–Sip contacts can be avoided. The implication of
model 4 is that reasonable distances are provided for
all combinations [polar–polar–exo, polar–polar–skeleton,
polar–equatorial–(skeleton)] upon Si incorporation into
the polar position (cf. Table 6).

The validity of model 4 is further
supported by analyzing
data of several more crystals. In all cases, the refined occupancies
were not significantly different. The composition SiB2.64(2) suggests the presence of 88% B10Sip2 and 12% B11Sip icosahedra in the disordered
α-SiB3–x structure (the occurrence
of B12 or B9Sip3 icosahedra
is rather unlikely; see next section). As a reminder, 100% Si2B10 and 100% SiB11 icosahedra would
correspond to the compositions SiB2.5 and SiB3.67, respectively.

3.2.2 29Si MAS NMR
Spectroscopy
The refined occupancy of several crystals suggests
a narrow range
of composition for α-SiB3–x, SiB2.62–SiB2.64, i.e., around 27.5
atom % Si. This value is more accurate than the one obtained from
EDX analysis of α-SiB3–x crystals
[25(1) atom % Si]. SEM investigations (cf. Figure 5c) indicated that α-SiB3–x single crystals possess a higher Si content than
the small, micrometer-sized, particles that initially form in a solid-state
bulk synthesis.

To also obtain clarity about the composition
of α-SiB3–x bulk samples,
we performed a 29Si MAS NMR measurement of a sample that
also contained a larger fraction unreacted nano-Si (about 20%). The 29Si MAS NMR spectrum of this sample, shown in Figure 10, revealed three distinct
resonances. The signal with peak maximum at −104 ppm is attributed
to unreacted Si, in agreement with ref (78). The signals with peak maxima at 11 and −64
ppm are assigned to Si atoms in the polar icosahedral and dumbbell
positions, respectively. With this assignment, the tetrahedrally coordinated
dumbbell Si attains a chemical shift that is closer to that of the
elemental structure, whereas the six-coordinated Si appears more deshielded
because its electrons contribute to delocalized icosahedral bonding,
which in turn would result in a positively polarized nature. Both
signals are relatively broad, due to the 29Si chemical
shifts distribution as a consequence of the disorder. The width of
the signal of unreacted Si is similar to that reported for bulk Si
nanopowder.78

Figure 10 29Si MAS
NMR spectrum of a sample containing both unreacted
Si (∼20 wt %) and α-SiB3–x. The error of the deconvoluted signal contributions is conservatively
estimated as 0.35(1), 0.44(1), and 0.21(1). The sample (∼300
mg) was prepared from a reaction mixture nano-Si/B = 1:3 (four pellets
with 6 mm diameter), heated at 1240 °C for 24 h.

The integrated 29Si MAS NMR signal intensities
for the
resonances at −64 and 11 ppm yield a icosahedral/dumbbell occupancy
ratio of 0.78(4). This implies a composition Si2(Si1.56B10.44) = SiB2.93(7) [25.4(4) atom
% of Si] for the bulk α-SiB3–x sample. We emphasize that the compositional analysis for single
crystals from the refinement diffraction data and for bulk samples
from 29Si MAS NMR experiments are most accurate. Therefore,
the conjecture is made that poly/microcrystalline bulk samples and
single-crystal samples (obtained at higher temperatures) of α-SiB3–x actually have a different composition.
The composition of single crystals is closer to the ideal, electron-precise,
composition SiB2.5.

In summary, the crystal structure
model 4 extracted
from high-resolution SC-XRD provides an average structure for disordered
α-SiB3–x with reasonable
geometric parameters and suggests a composition SiB2.64(2) for single-crystal samples. The composition of polycrystalline (bulk)
samples was established from 29Si MAS NMR investigations
and is more B-rich, SiB2.93(7). Next we analyze in more
detail the structural/occupational disorder in α-SiB3–x as well as the relative stability of α-SiB3–x with respect to β-SiB3 by theoretical calculations.

3.3 Calculated
Structural Stability and Electronic
Structures
3.3.1 Ground-State Search of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3
To search for the ground-state
σ of α-SiB3–x via the
cluster expansion (CE) method, we first established a database of
different σ values of α-SiB3–x with x ranging from 0.5 to −0.67 by
using the algorithm developed by Hart and Forcade.79 For the considered configuration space (42 atoms in a primitive
supercell, equivalent to three primitive rhombohedral unit cells),
a set of 4826 σ was obtained, which distributed over five compositions,
i.e., SiB2.5, SiB2.82, SiB3, SiB3.2, and SiB3.67. We singled out the first few hundreds
of the generated σ, calculated their total energy using DFT
(by the VASP code), and included them in the CE to determine the initial
ECIs, using the MAPS code.62 The obtained
initial ECIs were then used to predict the total energy of all generated
σ via eq 1. This
procedure should reveal the ground-state σ. However, one should
be aware that the ECIs determined from the first expansion may not
predict the total energy accurately and thus their predictive power
needs to be improved. To this end, the total energies predicted by
the initial ECIs were utilized as a guideline to single out a few
more hundreds of σ, not included in the first expansion. After
calculating their total energy by DFT, these σ were included
in a second expansion from which ECIs were redetermined. This procedure
can be repeatedly performed, until ECIs of desired quality are reached.

The final expansion included 1019 σ and employed a total
of 70 ECIs. That is, apart from the 0-site and 1-site interactions,
the ECIs are composed of 39 two-site interactions and 29 three-site
interactions. The final ECIs fit the 1019 input σ with a cross-validation
error of 4.817 meV/site (see Figure S21, Supporting Information), from which the ground-state σ values
for the compositions SiB2.5, SiB3, and SiB3.67 were predicted (see Figure S22, Supporting Information). We note further that DFT-derived and CE-predicted
ground-state σ agreed with each other and that no other ground-state
σ within 42 atoms/primitive supercell was predicted, thus confirming
the predictive power of the final ECIs.

The obtained ground-state
σ of α-SiB2.5 is
a 14-atom unit cell and naturally built of B10Sip2 icosahedra and Si dumbbells. Interestingly, the two
Sip atoms are arranged on the same polar triangle, thus
forming skeleton (intraicosahedral) Sip–Sip bonds as depicted in Figure 11a. This has also been found by An et al. in their study
of the shear deformation of Si2(B10Sip2)31 and is the same arrangement
as in molecular 1,2-dimethyl-ortho-disilaborane.28 The interatomic distances, which are compared
in Table 7, agree very
well. Expectedly, the substitution of Bp atoms for Sip results in a significant distortion of B10Sip2 clusters, and the lattice parameters of the most
stable α-SiB2.5 are found to deviate from the ideal
rhombohedral metric. The space group symmetry of the α-SiB2.5 ground-state σ is monoclinic Cm.
For α-SiB3, the most stable σ at T = 0 K (shown in Figure 11b) is based on a 28-atom primitive supercell. The structure
is composed of B11Sip and B10Sip2 icosahedra, which are arranged as alternating
close-packed layers parallel to the ab plane in the
triclinic unit cell. The structural parameters of the ground-state
σ of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3 are
reported as Tables 3–6, Supporting Information.

configurations for α-SiB2.5 (a) and
α-SiB3 (b). B and Si atoms are depicted as green
and red circles, respectively. The symmetry of α-SiB2.5 is monoclinic Cm (depicted is the primitive cell),
and the one of α-SiB3 is triclinic.

The predicted
ground-state σ values of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3 compare favorably with the experimental
structure (cf. Figure 9 and Table 7). Particularly,
the theoretical primitive unit cell volume of α-SiB2.5 (148.7 A3) agrees well with the experiment (SiB∼2.65, 147.1 A3). Also, the distribution of the distances for
the various skeleton bonds: Be–Be, Be–Bp, Be–Sip, Bp–Bp, Bp–Sip, Sip–Sip, and exo-bonds: Bp–Bp, Bp–Sip, Be–Si, as well as the Si–Si dumbbell bond
match well model 4 obtained from the refinement of high-resolution
SC-XRD data (cf. Table 7). When comparing the ground-state σ values of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3, one recognizes a contraction
of the primitive unit cell volume from 148.7 to 143.5 A3 (cf. Tables S3 and S4, Supporting Information).
This contraction is expected because of the smaller B11Sip icosahedra compared to B10Sip2 ones. It is difficult to claim a significant difference
between the hexagonal unit cell volume of polycrystalline bulk samples
with a composition SiB∼2.9 (Vaverage = 443.7 Å3, cf. Table 3) and of the single crystal sample with a
composition SiB∼2.65 (V = 441.4
Å3). The cell volume of the powder samples may also
be influenced by configurational disorder and/or the presence of microstrain.
The structural parameters of β-SiB3 are excellently
reproduced by our theoretical calculations, as reported in Table S5, Supporting Information. There is virtually
no difference in the calculated molar volume of β-SiB3 (V = 41.03 Å3) and the predicted
ground-state σ of α-SiB3 (41.02 Å3), cf. discussion of experimental volumes in Section 3.1.

3.3.2 Phase
Stability of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3
To assess the relative thermodynamic
stability of β-SiB3 and α-SiB3–x we computed their energies of formation with respect
to α-B12 and Si. The results, shown in Figure 12, reveal that,
despite being stable with respect to the elemental phases, the predicted
ground state of α-SiB2.5 is thermodynamically unstable
with respect to the reaction 6(α-SiB2.5) = 5(β-SiB3) + Si, with an enthalpy difference of H0 = 19.17 meV/atom. We additionally find that the arrangement
of Sip atoms on the same polar triangle of the most stable
σ of α-SiB2.5 is favored (by ∼7 meV/atom)
over distributing the two Sip atoms on the opposite triangles.
The formation of intericosahedral Sip–Sip exo-bonds, on the other hand, is highly unfavorable (by more than
1.294 eV/bond). The stability of intraicosahedral skeleton Sip–Sip bonds is in stark contrast to the situation
in the recently proposed high-pressure phase of boron carbide B2.5C. In B2.5C, the energy cost to form skeleton
Cp–Cp bonds is about 0.4 eV/bond.29 The lowest-energy σ of α-SiB3 is considerably less stable than β-SiB3,
by ∼30 meV/atom at T = 0 K, and it is also
unstable with respect to α-SiB2.5 and α-B12. The lowest-energy σ of the most boron-rich composition
considered, α-SiB3.67, is thermodynamically unstable
with respect to the elemental phases at T = 0 K.

and −0.67 in relation to thermodynamically stable β-SiB3. The red crosses are the DFT calculated formation energies
of the 1019 configurations (up to a supercell size of 42 atoms), which
were included in the cluster expansion.

Although the substitution of Bp for Sip results
in a distortion which reduces the space group symmetry of the ground-state
σ of α-SiB2.5 to monoclinic (Cm), the higher rhombohedral symmetry (R3̅m) of α-SiB3–x may
possibly be restored through the thermally induced configurational
disorder of Sip atoms on the polar site of B10Sip2 icosahedra. The configurational disorder
of the Sip atoms, presumably thermodynamically favored
at elevated temperature, gives rise to configurational entropy Sconf, which will contribute to the thermodynamic
stability of α-SiB2.5. Within the mean-field approximation, Sconf is volume- and temperature-independent
and may be derived according to  where g is the number of
distinguishable ways of arranging the atoms on the lattice sites.
The thermodynamic stability of disordered α-SiB2.5 at zero pressure is then determined by the Gibbs free energy as  where H0 is the
enthalpy of disordered α-SiB2.5 at T = 0 K relative to β-SiB3 and elemental Si. There
are six distinguishable configurations to arrange two Sip atoms on the same polar triangle of a B10Sip2 icosahedron, irrespective of the formation of exo-Sip–Sip bonds. Thus, Sconf/(14 atom unit cell) of disordered α-SiB2.5 is estimated to be kB ln(6).
For simplicity, we used the enthalpy H0 of the ground-state σ of α-SiB2.5 instead
of the proper enthalpy H of disordered α-SiB2.5, which will overestimate the stability of disordered α-SiB2.5. Including TSconf, and setting G(T) = 0, disordered α-SiB2.5 becomes thermodynamically stable with respect to Si and β-SiB3 at T > 1800 K. Apart from the overestimation
of the stability of α-SiB2.5, we find that this temperature
further increases, if the contributions from the lattice vibrations Svib are taken into consideration (see Figure S23, Supporting Information).

Turning
to the composition α-SiB3, for which σ
is composed of 50% B10Sip2 and 50%
B11Sip icosahedra, Sconf should be substantially higher compared to that of α-SiB2.5, for which σ is exclusively composed of B10Sip2 icosahedra. For disordered α-SiB3, Sconf/(28 atom unit cell) is
estimated as kB ln(2 × 62) because in addition to the configurational disorder of the
Sip–Sip pairs for B10Sip icosahedra, the Sip atoms of B10Sip icosahedra statistically occupy one out of the six polar
positions. With this coarse analysis, α-SiB3 is predicted
to be stable over β-SiB3 at T >
2300 K. Considering these theoretical results, together with our experimental
observations, it turns out clearly that α-SiB3–x is merely metastable.

3.3.3 Electronic
Structure
Figure 13 compares the electronic
DOS of the predicted ground-state σ of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3, as well as the DOS of β-SiB3. Expectedly, our simulations reveal that α-SiB2.5 is a semiconductor with a completely filled valence band
due to the electron-precise nature of Si2(B10Sip2). On the other hand, α-SiB3 is a metal. Such a metallic behavior of α-SiB3 can
be interpreted by the electron deficiency of the B11Sip icosahedron, requiring an extra electron to completely fill
all of its bonding states. As a result, the existence of B11Sip icosahedra not only gives rise to unoccupied electronic
states (holes) in the valence band but also implies that nonstoichiometric
α-SiB3–x, which is constituted
of B10Sip2 and B11Sip icosahedra, displays metallic properties. It should, however,
be noted that the electron-deficient state of icosahedral boron-rich
solids, caused by deviations from their electron-precise compositions,
can be compensated by configurational disorder arising either from
substitutional and interstitial defects or from vacancies, as recently
demonstrated for boron carbides B4–xC21,80−83 and boron subnitride B6.33N.6,84 It will be important to investigate and
characterize the electron transport properties of α-SiB3–x in the future, using single-crystal
and consolidated polycrystalline specimens [e.g., from spark plasma
sintering, cf. Supporting Information (Figure S12)]. Because of their more B-rich composition,
the latter are expected to possess a higher carrier concentration.

Figure 13 Electronic
density of states (DOS) for the ground-state configurations
of α-SiB2.5 and α-SiB3 (cf. Figure 11), and β-SiB3. The red, broken, horizontal line indicates the Fermi level.

In contrast to α-SiB3, β-SiB3 is a semiconductor. All of the boron atoms in the icosahedra
attain
an exo-bond and thus the boron substructure can be expressed as (B12)2–. The negative charge
is balanced by the cationic nature of the Si4 rhomboid
rings, which are electron-precise for an electron count of 3.5e per
atom. Thus, β-SiB3 can be expressed with an ionic
formula, Si42+(B12)2–.41−43 A detailed bonding analysis based
on an experimental charge density study will be the subject of a forthcoming
paper.85

3.4 Vibrational
Properties
Vibrational
studies of α-B12- and α-B12-derived
refractories have been previously undertaken for investigating fundamental
bonding properties of complex structured, “electron-deficient”,
solids as well as for analyzing structural disorder and imperfections
in these materials.86−91 Here, we sketch the vibrational property changes, which accompany
structure and bonding changes along the sequence α-B12–B6P−α-SiB3–x–β-SiB3, using Raman spectroscopy.

At this point, it is instructive to have a closer look at the evolution
of the icosahedral units across this sequence (shown in Figure 14). For the rhombohedral
structures, their local symmetry is D3d. To compare disordered α-SiB3–x, mass-weighed average coordinates were employed
for the polar position. As introduced earlier, going from α-B12 to B6P replaces intericosahedral 3c2c bonding
by exo-bonding to P2 dumbbells. Naturally, this expands
the exo-bond length between polar atoms considerably, as well as widens
the distances between polar atoms within the icosahedron (i.e., enlarges
the polar triangles of the icoahedron). Going from B6P
to α-SiB3–x then leads to
highly strained icosahedra. The significantly larger skeleton Si–B
distances also cause the (skeleton) Be–Be distances being considerably widened compared to B12 (from
1.78 to 1.85 Å). In orthorhombic β-SiB3, icosahedral
units attain a local D2h symmetry and consisting exclusively of B atoms, which distribute
over four crystallographic sites. The distinction between polar and
equatorial sites (which is based on rhombohedral symmetry) is not
respected. One can note that the skeleton B–B distances are
considerably larger compared to α-B12 and B6P. This holds especially true for the B4–B4 distances (which
exceed 1.9 Å). At the same time, the length of B4–B4 exo-bonds,
connecting neighboring icosahedra, corresponds very well to the exo-bond
length in B6P (1.72 vs 1.73 Å).

Figure 14 Comparison of interatomic
distances within icosahedral units and
exo-bonds along the series α-B12, B6P,
α-SiB3–x (with mass-weighed
average coordinates for the polar position), and β-SiB3.

The Raman spectra of α-B12, B6P, α-SiB3–x, and β-SiB3 are
compiled in Figure 15. According to group theory, there are 10 Raman-active modes for
α-B12, which distribute according to four A1g and six Eg. The modes were first assigned by Beckel et
al.,92 a more recent discussion is given
in ref (86). The pair
of A1g and Eg bands at highest wavenumbers (at
1187 and 1122 cm–1, respectively) is associated
with stretching modes of exo-bonded Bp atoms connecting
icosahedra. The next A1g and Eg pair (at 931
and 871 cm–1, respectively) is associated with localized
icosahedral (skeleton) modes. The A1g mode at 793 cm–1 corresponds to a radially in-and-out (breathing)
movement of Be atoms and thus can be associated with a
stretching mode of the 3c bonds. In the Eg mode at 774
cm–1, 2c and 3c bonds are strained significantly.
The Eg mode at 710 cm–1 is associated
with a deformation of polar triangles and thus relates to deformation/bending
of exo-bonds between Bp atoms. The pair of Ag and Eg bands at 691 and 598 cm–1, respectively,
may be associated with bending of 3c bonds. Finally, the sharp line
at 523 cm–1 (which is a Eg mode) corresponds
to libration of icosahedra.

Figure 15 Raman spectra of α-B12, B6P, α-SiB3–x, and
β-SiB3 single
crystals (from top to bottom). The α-B12, α-SiB3–x, and β-SiB3 spectra
were recorded from samples prepared for this work, whereas the spectrum
of B6P was provided by Reshetniak and corresponds to that
described in ref (93). For α-B12 and B6P, the symmetry of
the modes is indicated. The arrows indicate the relation of modes
in the spectra of α-B12 and B6P, and B6P and α-SiB3–x. The
horizontal dotted line marks the location of the libration mode in
the spectra of α-B12, B6P, and α-SiB3–x. The bars underneath the spectrum
of β-SiB3 correspond to DFT calculated Raman modes
for β-SiB3. The asterisks in the β-SiB3 spectrum mark possibly spurious peaks. The asterisks in the
α-B12 spectrum mark bands due to luminescence and/or 10B/11B isotope effects.86

The Raman spectrum of B6P can be easily related to α-B12. The phonon states
of B6P have been recently
calculated, and its Raman spectrum was analyzed.93 There are five A1g and seven Eg modes.
The A1g + Eg pair associated with changes of
the 3c bonds (equatorial breathing and bending) in α-B12 will blue-shift upon exchange of the 3c-bond for exo-bonds to P
atoms. At the same time, the modes associated with stretching of Bp–Bp exo-bonds will red-shift because of
their substantially increased length compared to α-B12 (cf. Figure 14).
As a consequence, all modes associated with stretching of exo-bonds
(i.e., both Bp–Bp and Be–P)
fall in a narrow range 1000–1100 cm–1. The
removal of 3c-bonds (through the introduction of the P2 units) leads also to more individual (localized) skeleton modes,
which fall in the range 630–830 cm–1. Skeleton
modes are red-shifted with respect to α-B12 because
of the “enlarged” icosahedra in B6P. The
location of the B12 libration mode is essentially maintained.
Lower-frequency modes are then associated with the P2 dumbbells.
The Ag mode at 479 cm–1 corresponds to
the P–P stretching mode. The Eg mode at 373 cm–1 corresponds to a P–B bending mode arising
from a rotational movement/displacement of the P2 entity.

When going from B6P to α-SiB3–x, it is obvious that the sharp modes for ordered
α-B12 and B6P become broad bands. This
has already been described by Aselage and Tallant.94 Bands associated with exo-bonds (both B–B and B–Si)
fall in a range 850–1000 cm–1, whereas skeleton
modes are essentially confined between 650 and 800 cm–1 (but distribute partially to even lower wavenumbers). The hump at
521 cm–1 may be associated with libration. The Si–Si
stretching mode of the dumbbell may be suspected at 412 cm–1. However, the analysis of calculated phonons (see below) shows that
also the displacement of Si atoms on the polar position falls in this
range of wavenumber. This is in agreement with the vibrational spectrum
of 1,2-dimethyl-ortho-disilaborane, (CH3)2Si2B10H10.28 Additional modes at lower wavenumbers are associated
with Si2 dumbbell rotations and translations, coupled with
displacements of Si atoms, which are part of the icosahedron. This
information was obtained from an inspection of the phonon DOS (pDOS)
of α-SiB2.5 structural models (see below) and the
analysis of frequencies and displacements at the Γ point.

Turning lastly to the spectrum of β-SiB3, one
notes first the sharp Raman lines because of its well-ordered crystalline
structure. Of the 93 optical modes of β-SiB3, 48
are Raman-active. About 30 are clearly visible in the spectrum shown
in Figure 15. Their
DFT calculated wavenumbers are included in this figure. Above 1000
cm–1 modes are associated with B–B exo-bonds,
which are between B4 atoms (cf. Figure 14). The B–B exo-bond length in β-SiB3 is reduced with respect to α-SiB3, but similar
to that of B6P. At lower wavenumbers, one first notes two
groups of bands, which are located between 600 and 750 cm–1 and 870 and 950 cm–1. The former correspond predominately
to icosahedron (skeleton) modes, whereas the latter relate to Si–B
exo-bonds. Modes below 500 cm–1 are then associated
with Si–Si vibrations within the zigzag chain structure of
Si4 rhomboid rings (cf. Figure 2). The mode at 474 cm–1 corresponds to the stretch between two Si1 atoms, which connect
rhomboid ring units. This Si–Si bond length (2.33 Å) is
similar to that of elemental Si (2.35 Å) and, thus, considerably
shorter than the distance between Si atoms forming dumbbells in α-SiB3–x. The intense band at 184 cm–1 is associated with the breathing mode of a Si4 rhomboid unit.

Figure 16 depicts
the phonon DOS of the α-SiB2.5 ground-state configuration
and β-SiB3. As mentioned above, the calculated pDOS
were used to assist in the assignment of Raman modes and vibrational
bands shown in Figure 15. Modes at highest wavenumber involve exclusively boron atoms. The
localized nature of the modes associated with Si–Si stretch
and Si4 breathing in β-SiB3 manifest as
spikes in the pDOS. Their location is well reproduced in the calculations.
The pDOS of β-SiB3 shows states between 500 and 600
cm–1, 750 and 850 cm–1, and at
950 cm–1 where there are gaps in the Raman spectrum.
Selection rules are not applicable for disordered α-SiB3–x, and its Raman spectrum resembles
an envelope of the pDOS.

total pDOS is depicted
as the broken, black line. The partial pDOS of icosahedron and dumbbell
forming atoms are shown as green and orange lines, respectively. For
comparison, the Raman spectra are included at the top of each panel
(in light gray).

4 Conclusions
We investigated the interplay between the binary silicon boride
phases α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 which have a similar composition but very different crystal
structures. α-SiB3–x is disordered
and nonstoichiometric, with a homogeneity range 0.1 < x <0.45. Its structure relates to the α-rhombohedral phase
of boron (α-B12) and features Si2 dumbbell
units at the location of intericosahedral 3c2e bonds in α-B12. Additionally, Si replaces partly (25–30%) B atoms
from the polar position of icosahedral units. Accordingly, the α-SiB3–x structure consists of a mixture
of B10Sip2 and B11Sip clusters, which are highly strained because of the rather
large size difference between B and Si atoms. In the structure model
deduced from high-resolution SC-XRD data, the polar position is split
into three sites (one Si and two B), which accounts well for the disparity
of interatomic distances introduced by the occupational disorder of
differently sized atoms. In contrast, the structure of β-SiB3 is completely ordered with respect to B and Si sites. The
Si partial structure constitutes polymeric zigzag chains of rhomboid
Si4 rings. Boron atoms form B12 icosahedra,
in which all of the B atoms attain an exo-bond to either a B atom
of a neighboring B12 unit or a silicon atom within the
rhomboid chains. The highly ordered nature of β-SiB3 is reflected in its Raman spectrum, which features narrow and distinct
lines. In contrast, the Raman spectrum of α-SiB3–x is characterized by broad bands, which nevertheless
show a clear relation to the vibrational modes of isostructural, ordered,
B6P.

α-SiB3–x is metastable
with respect to β-SiB3 and Si, and its formation
is kinetically driven. Polycrystalline bulk samples can be obtained
within hours when heating binary reaction mixtures at temperatures
1200–1300 °C. Thermodynamcially stable β-SiB3 forms when dwelling binary reaction mixtures at temperatures
1175–1200 °C for extended periods of time (days to weeks).
The slow kinetics of β-SiB3 formation can be overcome
by the application of high pressure (5–8 GPa). The fast kinetics
of α-SiB3–x formation can
exploited for simultaneous synthesis and consolidation of specimens
using spark plasma sintering. Both α-SiB3–x and β-SiB3 convert into SiB6 and Si at temperatures above 1250 °C.

Poly/microcrystalline
bulk samples and single-crystal samples of
α-SiB3–x have a different
composition. The composition of single crystals is closer to the ideal,
electron-precise, composition SiB2.5. Electronic structure
calculations yield band gaps of similar size for α-SiB2.5 and β-SiB3, around 2 eV. Experimentally obtained
α-SiB3–x (0.1 < x <0.45) should correspond to a p-type conductor. However,
the electron transport properties of α-SiB3–x are yet unknown, and it will be important to characterize
them, along with other physical properties, to assess its potential
as a technologically significant material.
