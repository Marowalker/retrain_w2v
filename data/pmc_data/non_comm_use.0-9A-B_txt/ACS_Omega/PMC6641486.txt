The effect of substitution on the
potential energy surfaces of
RB≡PR (R = H, F, OH, SiH3, and CH3) is
studied using density functional theories (M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP,
and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp). There is significant theoretical evidence that
RB≡PR compounds with smaller substituents are fleeting intermediates,
so they would be difficult to be detected experimentally. These theoretical
studies using the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP method demonstrate that only the
triply bonded R′B≡PR′ molecules bearing sterically
bulky groups (R′ = Tbt (=C6H2-2,4,6-{CH(SiMe3)2}3), SiMe(SitBu3)2, Ar* (=C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-i-Pr3)2), and SiiPrDis2) are significantly
stabilized and can be isolated experimentally. Using the simple valence-electron
bonding model and some sophisticated theories, the bonding character
of R′B≡PR′ should be viewed as R′BI  PR′. The present
theoretical observations indicate that both the electronic and the
steric effect of bulkier substituent ligands play a key role in making
triply bonded R′B≡PR′ species synthetically accessible
and isolable in a stable form.

I Introduction
Molecules
that do not contain a metal atom but which feature a
triple bond are very rare, probably because the nonmetallic elements
do not have valence d orbitals. Therefore, it is quite difficult to
use nonmetallic atoms to prepare or synthesize triply bonded molecules.1−8 The most famous example of a triply bonded nonmetallic compound
is ethyne, HC≡CH. During the last two decades, heavy homonuclear
acetylene analogues, RE14≡E14R (E14 = Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb), have been successfully isolated and
structurally characterized.9−18 Heteronuclear alkyne analogues, RE14≡E′14R (E′14 = group 14 elements), have also
been the subject of many studies in attempts to increase the understanding
of the structural features and their high reactivity.19−31 However, the chemistry of the triply bonded RE13≡E15R (E13 = group 13 atoms and E15 = group
15 atoms) molecules, which are isoelectronic with acetylene, has not
been the subject of as much study as the RE14≡E14R species. In fact, experimental studies of molecules that
feature a E13≡E15 triple bond are few.32−35 Significantly little is known about the structural and electronic
properties of these triply bonded RE13≡E15R systems, but there have been many studies of these new types of
acetylene analogues in many disciplines, such as structural chemistry,
catalysis, inorganic chemistry, and organometallic chemistry.1−8,32−38

Since the pioneering work of Coates and Livingstone on the
preparation
of phosphinoborane (Ph2BPPh2) in 1961,39 many new examples of the B–P single bond
have been found.40,41 These are reviewed in the literature.42−44 In addition to that of the molecules that feature a B–P single
bond, the synthesis
of compounds that feature the B=P double bond character has
attracted the interest of inorganic and organometallic chemists.42−45 Synthesis of these molecules, which have either the B–P single
bond or the B=P double bond, is of interest because they are
respectively isoelectronic with ethane and ethylene, from the valence-electron
viewpoint. It is therefore expected that the structural, physical,
and chemical properties of BP species are all similar to those of
CC. However, there is no such similarity of reactivity between CC
and BP molecules.46 The polarity and the
relative weakness of B–P bonds make the BP molecules much more
reactive, in additions or substitutions,46 than comparable CC compounds. Although molecules that feature either
a B–P single or a B=P double bond have been the subject
of many experimental and theoretical studies of their structures and
reactivity,47−73 compounds that feature a B≡P triple bond remain elusive.
To the authors’ best knowledge, there have been no experimental
or theoretical studies on this subject.

This is the first theoretical
examination to explore the possibility
of forming triply bonded RB≡PR molecules with respect to small
and large substituents. For details about the methodology and computational
results, see the Supporting Information. The substituent groups that are studied are H, F, OH, SiH3, CH3 and SiiPrDis2, Ar* (=C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-i-Pr3)2), SiMe(SitBu3)2, and Tbt (=C6H2-2,4,6-{CH(SiMe3)2}3)74−76 (see Scheme 1). The
conclusions of this theoretical study will give experimental synthetic
chemists a useful insight into a new research area: the B≡P
triply bonded species.

Scheme 1 II General
Considerations
According to the valence bond theory,77 the most convenient way to understand the chemical
bonding natures
of the B≡P triple bond is to partition the RB≡PR molecule
into two units: R–P and R–B (see Figure 1). From the spin viewpoint, there are two
reaction routes that combine the two fragments together to produce
a triply bonded RB≡PR compound in the singlet ground state.
One is [R–B]1 + [R–P]1 →
[RB≡PR]1 (path [1]) and the other is [R–B]3 + [R–P]3 → [RB≡PR]1 (path [2]). Their valence-bond orbital interactions are schematically
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Valence-bond
bonding paths [1] and [2] for the triply bonded RB≡PR
compound. ΔE1 = E(triplet state for R–P) – E(singlet
state for R–P) and ΔE2 = E(triplet state for R–B) – E(singlet state for R–B).

Figure 1 shows
that
the pathway that is used to yield RB≡PR depends on the promotion
energies of the fragments. As will be shown in the next section, the
present density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the
R–B component has a singlet ground state, whereas the R–P
unit has a triplet ground state. Therefore, if the excitation energy
from the triplet ground state to the singlet excited state for the
R–P unit is smaller than that from the singlet ground state
to the triplet excited state for the R–B component, then R–B
and R–P follow path [1] to form a triply bonded RB≡PR
molecule. However, if the promotion energy from the singlet ground
state to the triplet excited state for the R–B fragment is
smaller than that from the triplet ground state to the singlet excited
state for the R–P fragment, then R–B and R–P
follow path [2] to produce the RBPR species with a B≡P triple
bond.

As seen for path [1] in Figure 1, the triple bond in the RB≡PR compound
can
be viewed as two donor–acceptor π bonds and one donor–acceptor
σ bond. Accordingly, the bonding property of RB≡PR can
be regarded as RB  PR. Similarly, as seen for path [2] in Figure 1, the triple bond in the RB≡PR
compound can be described as one customary σ bond, one customary
π bond, and one donor–acceptor π bond, so the bonding
character of RB≡PR can be considered as RB  PR.

Using these theoretical
analyses, the bonding properties of the
RB≡PR species are interpreted in the following section.

III Results and Discussion
III.I Small Ligands on Substituted
RB≡PR
The small groups, R (=H, F, OH, SiH3, and CH3), are used to examine the effect of substituents
on the stability
of triply bonded RB≡PR molecules. Three types of DFT calculations
(M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp) are also
used to determine their reliability. Some physical properties and
the important geometrical parameters of RB≡PR are collected
in Table 1.

From Table 1, the
DFT computations anticipate that the B≡P triple bond lengths
(Å) are between 1.713 and 1.777 (M06-2X/Def2-TZVP), 1.714 and
1.781 (B3PW91/Def2-TZVP), and 1.725 and 1.793 (B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp).
According to the available experimental data, the bond distances (Å)
for the B–P single bond and the B=P double bond are
1.94–2.015 and 1.786–1.859,42−46,78 respectively. The bond lengths
of the B≡P triple bonds that are obtained from DFT calculations
are shorter than those that are acquired experimentally.42−46,78

Additionally, the DFT computations
given in Table 1 indicate
that the promotion energy from
the singlet ground state to the triplet state for the R–B unit
is calculated to be at least 22 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the excitation
energy from the triplet ground state to the singlet state for the
R–P fragment is estimated to be at least 15 kcal/mol. Namely,
the theoretical evidence demonstrates that the formation of the triply
bonded RB≡PR molecule with small ligands should follow path
[1], as shown in Figure 1. In other words, the bonding character of a triply bonded RB≡PR
molecule possessing small ligands can be represented as RB  PR. Because the covalent
radii of B and P are reported to be 82 and 106 pm,79 respectively, the overlapping populations between boron
and phosphorus should be small. Indeed, as seen in Table 1, the Wiberg bond index (WBI)80,81 for the B≡P bond is predicted to be less than 2.2. However,
the WBI for the C≡C bond in acetylene is shown to be 2.99.

The 1,2-migration reactions are used to determine the kinetic stability
of the RB≡PR species that are substituted with small ligands
at the three DFT levels of theory. The computational results are listed
in Figure 2, which
shows that the 1,2-shift reactions have two reaction routes: RB≡PR
→ TS1 → R2B=P: and RB≡PR →
TS2 → :B=PR2. From Figure 2, the three DFT calculations all demonstrate
that regardless of whether the small substituent groups are electronegative
or electropositive, the triply bonded RB≡PR molecules are neither
thermodynamically nor kinetically stable on the 1,2-shift potential
energy surfaces.

Figure 2 Relative Gibbs free energy surfaces for RB≡PR (R
= H, F,
OH, SiH3, and CH3). These energies are calculated
in kcal/mol and are calculated at the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP,
and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp levels of theory. For details, see the text and Table 1.

These theoretical observations provide strong evidence that
all
of the RB≡PR triply bonded molecules possessing small groups
should be unstable and must spontaneously rearrange to other doubly
bonded isomers.

III.II Large Ligands on Substituted
R′B≡PR′
Because these theoretical conclusions
show that small ligands (R)
do not stabilize triply bonded RB≡PR species, sterically bulky
ligands (R′), such as SiMe(SitBu3)2, SiiPrDis2, Tbt, and Ar*74−76 (Scheme 1), are used
to determine the possibility of forming a triply bonded R′B≡PR′
molecule. Recently, Liptrot and Power demonstrated that London dispersion
forces, which are nonvalent interactions between the bulkier ligands,
significantly influence the stability and structure of sterically
congested inorganic systems.82 Therefore,
the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP method83 is used in
this work to obtain precise results.

Similarly to RB≡PR
that are substituted with small ligands, as discussed previously,
the 1,2-migration reactions, R′B≡PR′ →
R2′B=P: and R′B≡PR′
→ :B=PR2′ (Scheme 2), are used to determine the feasibility
of producing triply bonded R′B≡PR′ compounds,
using the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP method. Clearly, as seen in Table 2, the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP data
demonstrates that because of a large steric effect the doubly bonded
isomers (:B=PR2′ and R2′B=P:)
are all respectively higher in energy by at least 89 and 73 kcal/mol
than their corresponding triply bonded R′B≡PR′
molecule. There is strong theoretical evidence that sterically crowded
substituents protect the weak B≡P triple bond.

g See Scheme 2.

h The Wiberg bond
index (WBI) for
the B≡P bond: see refs (80, 81).

As seen in Table 2, the triple bond lengths for
these triply bonded R′B≡PR′
molecules are in the range of 1.74–2.02 Å, which are somewhat
larger than the B≡P triple bond distances of the substituted
RB≡PR compounds bearing small ligands shown in Table 1. The reason for the longer
bond lengths for the R′B≡PR′ species should be
the steric effects.

Table 2 shows that
the singlet–triplet energy splitting (ΔEB′) for the R′–B
unit is at least 25 kcal/mol, but the modulus of ΔEP′ for the R′–P
moiety is predicted to be at least 30 kcal/mol on the basis of the
M06-2X/Def2-TZVP method. Namely, it is easier for the R′–B
unit to jump from the singlet ground state to the triplet state than
for the R′–P monomer, which is promoted from the triplet
ground state to the singlet state. Therefore, the two bulkily substituted
fragments, R′–B and R′–P, follow path
[2] (Figure 1) to yield
a triply bonded R′B≡PR′ molecule. That is, [R′–B]3 + [R′–P]3 → [R′B≡PR′]1. According to the valence-orbital interactions shown in Figure 1, the bonding character
of a triply bonded R′B≡PR′ compound featuring
bulky ligands can be considered to be R′B  PR′. In other words,
its B≡P triple bond consists of one traditional σ bond,
one donor–acceptor π bond, and one traditional π
bond. However, for the cases of Ar*, our computational values shown
in Table 2 indicate
that ΔEB′ for the B–R′ fragment (35 kcal/mol) is larger
than ΔEP′ for the P–R′ fragment (at least 31 kcal/mol).
According to Figure 1, the triply bonded (Ar*)B≡P(Ar*) molecule can be considered
to be (Ar*)BP  (Ar*) (path [1]).

From Figure 1, it
is noteworthy that the lone-pair orbital of the R′–P
fragment includes both s and p valence orbitals. This means that the
overlap coupling between the lone-pair orbital of R′–P
and the pure p orbital of R′–B is feeble. As a result,
the bond order of the B≡P triple bond must not be large. Indeed,
the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP results in Table 2 demonstrate that the WBI values for the B≡P
triple bond are calculated to be 2.388 (SiMe(SitBu3)2), 2.152 (SiiPrDis2), 1.963 (Tbt), and 1.966 (Ar*), respectively. Again, the theoretical
findings show that the bulky ligands can effectively protect the central
weak B≡P triple bond and increase its bond order.

The
charge decomposition analysis (CDA), which was published by
Dapprich and Frenking,84 has been utilized
in this work to explain the interactions between two components (i.e.,
(SiMe(SitBu3)2)–B and
(SiMe(SitBu3)2)–P) of
a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)B≡P(SiMe(SitBu3)2) molecule. On the basis of
the M06-2X/Def2-TZVP method, the computational data are given in Table 3. From Table 3, the largest contribution from
a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–P
fragment to a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–B fragment is No. 224 (HOMO) orbital, demonstrating that
the former donates electrons (0.216e) to the latter mainly through
the HOMO orbital. In addition, the largest contributions from a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–B component to a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–P component is No.
223 (HOMO-1) orbital, indicating that the latter donates electrons
(0.0682e) to the former principally through the HOMO-1 orbital. After
considering the electron donations from various orbitals of both (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–P and (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–B, one may obtain the
net amount of electron transfer, which is calculated to be negative
(−0.226), suggesting that a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–P unit donates more electrons to a (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–B unit. This conclusion
based on the CDA method agrees well with the valence-electron bonding
model (Figure 3). Again,
the theoretical information indicates that the bonding nature of R′B≡PR′
can be represented as R′B  PR′.

The natural bond orbital (NBO)80,81 and natural
resonance theory (NRT)85−87 are used to analyze the electronic densities of (SiMe(SitBu3)2)B≡P(SiMe(SitBu3)2), (Tbt)B≡P(Tbt), (SiiPrDis2)B≡P(SiiPrDis2), and (Ar*)B≡P(Ar*), whose theoretical results are collected
in Table 4. On the
basis of the WBI values in Table 4, the bond orders for the B≡P bond are 2.39,
1.96, 2.15, and 1.97 for SiMe(SitBu3)2, Tbt, SiiPrDis2, and Ar*, respectively.
This data is similar to the values that are calculated using NRT,
of 2.55, 2.47, and 2.27, respectively. This theoretically computed
data strongly suggests that steric hindrance shelters the intramolecular
rearrangements and gives the central B≡P bond a greater bond
order. The NBO/NRT analyses in Table 4 show that the bulkily substituted R′B≡PR′
compounds that are studied in this work all have an analogous electronic
structure. For instance, the triple bond in (SiMe(SitBu3)2)B≡P(SiMe(SitBu3)2) is composed of a σ component, which is
slightly polarized toward the P element (57%) and two nondegenerate
π components that are heavily polarized toward the P center
(π⊥, 76% and π∥, 63%).88 Both the σ and π NBO orbitals are
equally filled, with approximately 1.98 (σ), 1.92 (π⊥), and 1.93 (π∥) electrons,
which is a feature of localized bonds. Figure 3 schematically shows the two nondegenerate
π bonding orbitals (π⊥ and π∥). These are similar to those in path [2], shown in Figure 1.

IV Conclusions
This study uses theoretical computations to determine the possibility
of producing triply bonded RB≡PR molecules using different
types of substituents. The present work provides the first theoretical
examination of the effect of substituents on the stability and electronic
bonding structures of these triply bonded RB≡PR species. In
terms of these substituted RB≡PR systems, the following conclusions
are drawn.(1) Calculations at three different levels
of DFT are in excellent agreement. All three DFT computations demonstrate
that regardless of the electronegativity of the substituents that
are attached,88 triply bonded RB≡PR
molecules, which bear the small substituents, are unstable and readily
undergo intramolecular rearrangement to yield the correspondingly
doubly bonded isomers. In other words, the triply bonded RB≡PR
molecules possessing the small ligands are so fragile that their experimental
detection is unlikely.

(2) Only sterically large substituents
(R′) significantly stabilize triply bonded R′B≡PR′
compounds. These theoretical observations demonstrate that these bulky
ligands hinder the intramolecular rearrangement and obstruct the intermolecular
associations. Accordingly, the present theoretical proof demonstrates
that it should be possible to synthesize molecules that feature a
B≡P triple bond possessing both bulkier ligands.

(3) On the basis of the valence electron
bonding model and some theoretical bonding analyses (i.e., NBO and
NRT), it is concluded that the bonding nature of triply bonded R′B≡PR′
species that feature bulky groups is R′B  PR′. Namely, the
B≡P triple bond comprises one donor–acceptor π
bond, one conventional σ bond, and one conventional π
bond.



Experimentalists are encouraged
to confirm these theoretical predictions.
