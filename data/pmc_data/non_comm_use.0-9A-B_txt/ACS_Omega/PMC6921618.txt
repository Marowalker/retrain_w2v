The present study proposes a new PI controller tuning
method using
extended predictive control (EPC). The PI controller parameter values
are calculated using the EPC controller output and its closed-loop
response. This provides a simple and an effective tuning strategy
which results in an improved closed-loop response compared to conventional
tuning methods. The tuning methodology is applicable for single input
single output and multi input multi output stable processes. Simulation
and experimental results reveal the efficacy of the method under plant
uncertainty conditions.

1 Introduction
The three term control
(PID) has been one of the simplest and most
popular control approaches over six decades. The major demand of PID
is due to its simple structure, ease of use, and robustness.1 Apart from a conventional structure, the control
loops are modified in many ways in order to obtain better performance
and efficiency.2,3 The drawback of the traditional
PID controller is that it cannot handle constraints, it cannot manage
strong interactions, and it is generally used in the control of simple
processes.4 Therefore, off-the-shelf algorithms
are not an optimal choice in many processes.5 This limitation has extended research toward advanced control areas
like optimal, robust, and adaptive control.6−8 The recent developments
comprise event-triggered control that deals with the problems of finite
communication for constrained nonlinear systems through optimal policy.9 Model predictive control (MPC) is another control
approach, which is able to handle the process interactions and constraints.
It is a popular and widely used control approach in several contexts.10

MPC predicts future values of the process
outputs based on a reasonably
accurate dynamic model and provides the appropriate input signals
by solving an optimization problem involving the computation of the
optimum set points with constraints on inputs and outputs.11 Garriga and Soroush,12 presented a brief survey on various methods of control tuning in
theoretical and practical aspects. Depending on applications and requirements,
there exist different types of MPC algorithms like adaptive,13 explicit,14 robust,15 economic,16,17 stochastic,18 distributed,19 and
so forth. Though MPC is advanced and embraces a predictive functionality,
it lacks in the ease of industrial applications because of complex
calculations within the sampling interval. This limitation laid the
foundation toward the bridging of MPC and PID control schemes20−23 through which MPC controller gain or closed-loop data is used to
tune the PID parameters. As far as industrial implementation is concerned,
the idea of bridging the advanced control mechanism and conventional
controller spreads over in different aspects.24 Preitl et al.25 presented two iterative
control schemes to formulate an objective function and validated with
a PI controller. Vrkalovic et al.26 had
developed a model free sliding mode and PI-fuzzy controller using
a Grey Wolf Optimizer.27 In application
toward optimization techniques, the teaching–learning-based
optimization algorithm is applied to obtain the parameters of the
fuzzy-PID controller.28

The method
proposed here is a new PI controller tuning scheme using
the closed-loop data of the extended predictive control (EPC) strategy.
The controller parameters are obtained as a function of EPC manipulated
variable response, time constant of the actual process, rise time
of EPC unit step response, and condition number “r2”. In addition to the proposed control method,
the mathematical modeling presented by Fedele38 has been extended to multi input multi output (MIMO) processes.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a system description of the lab-scale
distillation column and methodology of parameter estimation. The control
design methodology is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 contains simulation results of parameter estimation
using the procedure given in Section 2 and control scheme implementation on two case studies
are presented with 30% plant parameter uncertainty. The last section
is devoted to conclusions.

2 System Description and Mathematical Modeling
The model is assumed as the first order plus dead time (FOPDT)
structure throughout the paper, and the system is assumed to be linear
time-invariant at a certain operating region. The online binary distillation
column is considered for this study with a feed mixture of 30% isopropyl
alcohol and 70% water. The boiling point of isopropyl alcohol and
water ranges as 81.5–82.5 °C29 and 99–100 °C correspondingly. The intent is to separate
this mixture and obtain maximum purity of isopropyl alcohol through
the distillation process. Unlike the application in this paper, there
are mixtures called azeotropes, which exhibits the same boiling point
throughout the distillation process.30 Alves
et al.31 presented a new approach for the
prediction of azeotrope formation using neural networks. Figure 1 depicts the schematic
diagram of the bubble cap distillation column. The column consists
of five trays placed in the ascending order from bottom to top which
are equidistant to each other. A heater with 4000 kW is fitted at
the bottom of the column, which is manipulated using solid state relay,
and there is an opening to inject the feed into the column. A condenser
is located at the top of the column, which is used to cool down the
hot vapor, which in turn converts it into the liquid state. There
is a reflux drum at the outlet of the condenser which is used to collect
condensed liquid, and a drum at the bottom end is used to collect
the purified distillate. Reflux flow rate is manipulated by using
a peristaltic pump (model: EnerTech ENPD 100). The sensors and final
control elements are interfaced with the PC (configuration: HP ProDesk
400 G3 SFF, 4 GB RAM and 512 GB) using the data acquisition card.
The mathematical modeling and controller execution have been realized
through Matlab 2018a.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the distillation column.

Temperature control is the crucial operation of
distillation which
influences the purity of the distillate.32 If the temperature at a certain tray point in the system is too
high or too low, expectable products or their quality may not be guaranteed.33 Controlling of such systems is a challenge because
of their nonlinear behavior. The control design is more complex because
of its wide operating region of feed composition and flow rates. Model
identification of such systems is difficult because of interaction
in the process because of tray temperatures.34,35 If the temperature at the top of the tower is more than what it
should be, heavier components will be vaporized and become a part
of the overhead product instead of flowing down as liquid and vice
versa with lower temperatures.36 Pressure
is another parameter which influences the purity of distillate through
the boiling temperature of liquid. 1  

For the MIMO process, the overall system
equation is 2  

A linear regression approach is used
to estimate system parameters
through the equations that are obtained directly using the process
output when the system is subjected to step change.37 Unlike other least square methods which uses the process
output from t ≥ θ, this approach considers
process output from time where the step change U0 is applied. The output of the process when step input is
applied to eq 1 is given
as 3  

Differentiating eq 3 with respect to s results
in 4  

Summing up eqs 3 and 4 5  

To eliminate the derivatives of laplace
“s”, eq 5 is divided
with s2 6  by applying inverse Laplace transform in eq 6 7  

Equation 7 can be
rewritten as 8  where, θT = L, g1(t) =
2∫0ty(ρ)dρ – ty(t), g2(t) = ∫0ty(ρ)dρ, g3(t) = y(t), g4(t) =
−∫0t∫0ρy(λ)dλ dρ
+ ∫0tρy(ρ)dρ.

The linear eq 8 allows
the estimation of the unknown parameters “T” and “L” and the values of
the auxiliary variable θ. To this aim, assume that gi(t), i = 1, ..., 4 are measured at times 0, Ts, ..., (n – 1)Ts, where Ts is the sampling period and
“n” is the number of samples, and it
is defined as 9   10  and 11  

From eqs 9–11, eq 8 can be rewritten as 12  

The estimation of parameters using
least squares is obtained as 13  

The system gain “K” is obtained
by considering the steady state process output. Because there exist
cases where the step stops before the steady state is reached, the
parameter “K” has to be also identified
during the plant transient response. To this aim, consider the step
response of the process after t = θ. 14  

Integrating y(t) from t = θ to n 15  

From eq 15, process
gain “K” can be obtained as 16  

The mathematical modeling approach
has been implemented to estimate
model parameters for the lab-scale distillation column as well as
Wood and Berry plant.39 Additional integral
has been used in eq 7 to improve the filtering performance.

3 Control Design Methodology
A new control
tuning method presented in this paper is carried
out by considering the methodology of EPC and suppression matrix formulation.40 In particular, PI controller gain parameters
are computed by using closed-loop data of EPC.

Extending PID
controller gains from the MPC approach is a contemporary
method of the advanced control theory. There exists different aspects of formulating
PID gains from MPC20,41−44Table 1 reports different PID formulations based
on MPC.

The objective function to be minimized is defined
over the prediction
horizon (p), as a function of error and controller
response for the servo operation. This objective function is minimized
by evaluating a profile of manipulated input moves implemented at
every sampling instant over the control horizon (m). The control law is based on the solution of the quadratic cost
function using least squares with a weighting factor on the manipulated
variable. 17  

In this paper, an infinite horizon
control problem is considered
to formulate the predictive algorithm. The unconstrained MPC control
law is given by45 18  where “A” is
a dynamic matrix obtained from the step response coefficients of individual
transfer function (gij), where “i” is the output and “j” is the input of the process. “λ”
is a suppression weighting factor, “e”
is the vector of tracking difference between trajectory reference
and the prediction of the process. “λI” of eq 18 is
considered as the extended moving suppression matrix and it is represented
as WEMS. For “n” step prediction (n = runtime), system matrix
“A” of the MIMO process for “N” inputs and “M”
outputs is given by 19  

For the two input two output (TITO)
process, eq 19 can be
rewritten as 20  

The weighting matrix WEMS is formulated
by considering the same even elements of the first row to improve
the ill conditioning of the weighting matrix. For the TITO process, WEMS is given as 21  

From eq 21  for m = 3.

The tuning
parameters r1 and r2 are tuned independently based on the corresponding
step response coefficient matrices A11 and A22. Initially, r2 is tuned using condition number γ through independent
matrix A22. The condition number of (ATA + WEMS)−1 is obtained as 22  and approximated condition number γapprox using weighting ratio “r”
and weighting factor R1 is given as 23  

The analysis to formulate eqs 22 and 23 is presented by Abu-Ayyad
et al.46 through a relatively lower condition
number that depicts a smaller move suppression value.

The value
where condition number γ and approximated condition
number γapprox overlaps is considered as the tuning
value of r2. Later, using r2, the tuning parameter r1 is chosen. The actual and approximated condition number comparison
is shown in Figure 2. The tuning parameter R1 is considered
as “10” for all processes. Another tuning parameter
“β” is obtained using the initial element of matrix
“ATA” from
individual submatrices (A11 and A22).

Figure 2 Condition number comparison of actual and approximated.

3.1 Formulation of PI Formula from EPC Control
The EPC algorithm is performed using eq 18 for unit step input in offline considering
the process as an infinite prediction horizon problem (p = n). Proportional gain is computed by summing
up the magnitude change of controller output “Δu” for all time samples of EPC response till its
settling time. Integral gain is obtained as a function of proportional
gain and rise time “Tr”
of EPC unit step response.

Proportional gain 24  where “i” denotes
the loop number (zth loop), δ is a tuning parameter
selected as the maximum value of the off-diagonal time constant for
loop-1 and the minimum value of the diagonal time constant for loop-2,
that is,    “Ts”
is the settling time of EPC closed-loop response and “Δu” is the change in controller output. r2 is the intersection value of the actual and approximated
condition number (γ).

Integral gain 25  where “Tr” is rise time and “α” is the tuning parameter
that employs the speed of the process ranging (0,1). The pace of the
process is directly proportional to offline EPC response for unit
step input. Tuning parameter “δ” for the single
input single output (SISO) process is selected as the time constant
“T” of the FOPDT model.

4 Results and Discussion
In this section,
parameter estimation and validation of the control
tuning method has been carried out by considering two case studies
of MIMO processes. The proposed method has been compared with GPC–PID
and hybrid control methods. Performance indices using integral time
absolute error (ITAE) is presented with 30% uncertainty on all plant
model parameters.

4.1 Parameter Estimation
The estimation
of model parameters has been carried out on two case studies (case-1:
Wood and Berry model39 and case-2 experimental
distillation setup17). The methodology
presented in Section 2 is used to estimate the model parameters.

4.1.1 Parameter Estimation Case-1: Wood and Berry
Model Estimation
The Wood and Berry model is considered as
the benchmark for illustrating the MIMO process. The model estimation
is carried out by considering the composition of the overhead and
bottom product as process variables with reflux flow and steam flow
as manipulated inputs. It has been proven to be a difficult process
to control because of an interaction effect between the input–output
variables. The true model has been depicted in eq 26. 26  

The step response data for the Wood
and Berry (WB) plant is obtained by performing two experiments with
unit step input sequentially for both the inputs (U1 and U2). Figure 3 depicts the block diagram
of the open loop TITO process.

Figure 3 Open loop block diagram representation
for the TITO process.

Step response data of eq 26 are used to estimate the model parameters
subjected to eqs 8 and 16. Figures 4 and 5 depict fit test responses of
the estimated
model.

Figure 4 G11 and G12 open loop response of the WB model.

Figure 5 G21 and G22 open loop response of the WB model.

It is to be noted that to replicate simulation
response of the
WB model as actual measurement response, the plant outputs are corrupted
with random Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance as a factor
of 0.05 magnitude. Table 2 depicts the comparison of model parameters with absolute
error and error percentage.

Table 2 Comparison of Estimated Model Parameters
for the WB Model with the Actual Model

K11	12.8	12.78	0.02	0.15	
T11	16.7	16.65	0.05	0.29	
θ11	1	1.04	0.04	4	
K12	–18.9	–18.92	0.02	0.1	
T12	21	21.04	0.04	0.19	
θ12	3	2.97	0.03	1	
K21	6.6	6.575	0.025	0.37	
T21	10.9	10.75	0.15	1.37	
θ21	7	7.18	0.18	2.57	
K22	–19.4	–19.42	0.02	0.1	
T22	14.4	14.45	0.05	0.34	
θ22	3	2.97	0.03	1	
Therefore the estimated model is given as 27  

4.1.2 Parameter Estimation Case-2: Lab-Scale Distillation
Column
A highly interactive lab-scale distillation column
(Figure 17) is considered
for the experimental study to estimate the model parameters. The two
tray temperatures (tray-1 and tray-5) are considered as process variables
with heater voltage (Qh) and reflux flow
rate (Lr) as manipulated inputs correspondingly.
The step test has been performed for both the inputs sequentially
by manipulating one input change at a time. Figures 6 and 7 show fit test
of the lab-scale distillation column.

Figure 6 G11 and G12 open loop response of the experimental system.

Figure 7 G21 and G22 open loop response of the experimental system.

The initial manipulated input are considered as,
[Lr, Qh] =
[10, 50]%. For step-1,
the inputs are excited from [10, 50] to [35, 50]% and corresponding
response at Y1 and Y2 is observed. Similarly, for step-2, the inputs are excited
from [10, 50] to [10, 75]%.

Note that because of steady state
requirement, the step response
time with step change in reflux flow rate is more than the step change-applied
heater voltage with respect to the variable of interest.

The
model estimated by using eqs 8 and 16 is 28  

4.2 Implementation of Control Schemes
The decentralized control structure with a decoupler shown in Figure 8 is considered for
the simulation and comparison of the proposed controller with GPC–PID,42,47 and the hybrid control approach41 has
been used. Simulation is executed with servo and regulatory operations
under 30% plant parameter uncertainties in “K”, “τ”, and “θ”.

control structure with a decoupler, where, D11 = D22 = 1, D21 = −G21/G22, and D12 = −G12/G11.

4.2.1 Case Study-1: Wood and Berry Model
4.2.1.1 Servo Operation
The Wood and
Berry model is subjected to closed-loop simulation with set point
step changes of [2,4], applied at time (0,200) min for loop-1. The
response is observed at Y1, as shown in Figure 9a, and for loop-2,
the response of process variable Y2 with
set point step changes of [1,2], applied at time (0,200) min, is represented
in Figure 9b. Correspondingly,
manipulated variable responses of loop-1 and loop-2 are shown in Figure 10a,b, respectively.
The controller parameters using GPC-PID and proposed methodology for
Wood and Berry model is given in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively.

4.2.1.2 Regulatory Operation
Load on
both the loops are imposed individually at the zero steady state,
as shown in Figure 8. When load (L1) is applied at output Y1, the effect observed on output Y1 is quoted as the main effect, and the effect observed
on output Y2 is the interaction effect
to the load at Y1. It is the same in the
case of load (L2) on Y2 as well. Figure 11a depicts the response of Y1 when load is applied at Y1. For the
same load at Y1, the response of Y2 is shown in Figure 11b.

Figure 11 Regulatory response of Y1 and Y2 when load (d1)
is applied on Y1.

Similarly, Figure 12a depicts the response of Y1 when load
is applied at Y2. For the same load at Y2, the response of Y2 is shown in Figure 12b.

Figure 12 Regulatory response of Y1 and Y2 when load is applied on Y2.

4.2.1.3 Performance Indices
When determining
the performance of the controller, it is often helpful to consider
how “large” the error from the setpoint is. ITAE is
one of the criteria that are used to evaluate the controller performance
by essentially adding errors at every sampling instant over a period
of run-time. System perturbation is one aspect of determining the
efficiency of the controller. In this paper, plant parameters are
perturbed with 30% uncertainty in all individual model parameters
with four cases (C-1 is nominal plant; C-2 is 30% uncertainty in “K”; C-3 is 30% uncertainty in “K” and “T”; and C-4 is 30% uncertainty
in “K”, “T”,
and θ). Table 3 refers to servo operation performance of the Wood and Berry model
with plant uncertainties for different control schemes.

Overall performance of hybrid control is efficient
compared to
the proposed algorithm in case of nominal and uncertainty in “K” but lags when uncertainty is introduced in “T”
and θ cases. Through the performance index, it has been observed
that the proposed control scheme is effective compared to GPC–PID
and hybrid control schemes.

5 Conclusions
In this work, the parameter
estimation using the regression method
has been carried out, and the obtained model is in the form of the
FOPDT structure. The development of a new PI control tuning approach
has been presented from the EPC strategy. The controller parameters
are formulated from summation of instantaneous controller changes
and rise time of the closed-loop unit step response of EPC. The application
of this novel design has been demonstrated through benchmark and experimental
models of the distillation process. Performance analysis has been
carried out to depict the efficiency of the controller under plant

6 Experimental Implementation and Analysis
The proposed controller has been implemented on the experimental
setup shown in Figure 17 to control coupled tray temperature.

Figure 17 Lab-scale
binary distillation column (available in lab-2, ICE dept,
MIT, Manipal).

Figures 18 and 19 depict process variables and
manipulated variable
response of the lab-scale distillation column. The operating region
of tray temperature was initialized at [61, 44] °C and the proposed
controller was implemented with set points of [75, 70] °C for
tray-1 and tray-5, respectively. As the system reached the desired
state, the pressure valve on the reflux drum is disturbed to observe
the regulatory operation. In rejecting the load disturbance, the controller
effect has been observed on both the manipulated inputs.

Figure 18 Experimental
response of process variables for the proposed controller.

Figure 19 Experimental response of manipulated variables for the
proposed
controller.

There is an arrangement of the pressure knob on
the reflux drum
which is used to release excess pressure in the column. The system
is perturbed with an external disturbance by releasing pressure manually
using the pressure knob, and the regulatory response effecting temperature
of tray-5 is observed. When the disturbance is applied at 2.25 ×
104 sampling instant, the effect of the load is observed
at 2.65 × 104 sampling instant (because temperature
control is a slow process). While controlling tray temperature, the
controller tends toward saturation because of integral windup. To
overcome integral windup, a conditional integrator approach3 is used within the control loop.
