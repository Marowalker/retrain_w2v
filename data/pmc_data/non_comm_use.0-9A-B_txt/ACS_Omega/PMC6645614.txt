The sluggish oxygen evolution reaction
(OER) hinders the development
of electrocatalytic water splitting for energy conversion and storage.
Therefore, it is imperative to explore the cost-effective and highly
efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for OER. Herein, we are
introducing such OER electrocatalyst based on Co, fabricated through
an ionic-liquid-assisted one-step synthesis, where ionic liquid played
a dual role as solvent cum structure-directing agent. Besides possessing
large-accessible surface area and numerous active sites, the as-prepared
stable CoO nanosheets exhibited excellent electrochemical activity
through establishing an extensive contact with the electrolyte. Under
alkaline conditions, the overpotential to achieve a current density
of 10 mA cm–2 is only 320 mV, and the Tafel slope
is as small as 70 mV dec–1. Thus, our work provides
a new pathway for designing and engineering the highly efficient non-noble
metal OER electrocatalysts by using ionic liquids.

1 Introduction
The
oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a half reaction of water
splitting, has been extensively studied in recent years.1−3 However, the OER is a complicated reaction as four electrons are
needed for the formation of an oxygen molecule, which makes it kinetically
sluggish and requires large overpotential.4−7 Therefore, from a practical point
of view, highly efficient OER electrocatalyst is crucial to accelerate
this reaction. Presently, ruthenium oxide (RuO2) and iridium
oxide (IrO2) are the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts.8,9 However, as precious metals, the scarcity and high cost limit their
applications in industry. Therefore, research on earth-abundant, environmental-friendly,
and cost-effective non-noble metal compounds as efficient electrocatalysts
for OER is of great significance.

Transition metal oxides,4 phosphides,10,11 hydroxides,12 sulfides,13 double
hydroxide hybrids,1,14−16 and so forth,
have been reported as efficient electrocatalysts for
OER. Among them, the cobalt (Co)-based compounds are considered as
the promising candidates because of their high intrinsic catalytic
activity, low-cost, earth abundance, and environmental benign nature.17−20 However, their catalytic activity is generally restricted by their
structure, limited number of active sites, and poor conductivity,
especially, in case of cobalt oxides.21,22 Several strategies
were employed in the past to improve the catalytic activity of Co-based
OER electrocatalysts, for example, doping with heteroatoms, manufacturing
defect-rich structures, lowering the size, and forming the composites.
However, these protocols are often complicated or limited to specific
cases.23−28 Thus, a simple and feasible strategy to increase the number of active
sites for improving the catalytic performance of Co-based electrocatalysts
is urgently needed. It is well-known that two-dimensional (2D) structure
can not only expose maximum active sites but also expand the contact
area between the catalysts and the electrolyte.29−33 Hence, it is promising for improving the catalytic
activity of electrocatalysts for OER. Numerous efforts have been devoted
to explore effective methods for preparing 2D cobalt oxide materials
as electrocatalysts for OER. However, all previous attempts faced
insurmountable challenges to some extent. Ionic liquids (ILs) are
referred to as “designer solvents” with tunable physicochemical
properties and desired functions by changing their components.34,35 Owing to their high fluidity, low-melting temperature, high-boiling
temperature, and very low-vapor pressure properties, they have been
used so far as structure-directing agents in the synthesis of nanostructured
materials such as CuO, SnS2, and CuS.36−40 Recently, our group also employed ILs successfully
for fabricating one-dimensional hierarchical MoO2, an efficient
hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst.41 However, ILs are used rarely in the synthesis of OER electrocatalysts.

Herein, we describe an IL-assisted synthetic method for making
cobalt oxide (CoO) electrocatalyst for OER. We fabricated CoO nanosheets
through a one-step ionothermal method by using cobalt(III) acetylacetonate
(Co(acac)3) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide
([BMIM][NTf2]). The IL—[BMIM][NTf2] acts
as a solvent and structure-directing agent during the synthetic process.
When tested for OER activity, the as-prepared CoO nanosheets exhibited
superior electrocatalytic performance with notable stability under
alkaline conditions. Thus, the present synthetic strategy provides
a new way for preparing the highly performable OER electrocatalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
The molecular structures of
the precursors used in this report
are shown in Figure 1A, and Figure 1B illustrated
the simple synthetic procedure involved. Direct heating of the mixture
of precursors under N2 atmosphere yielded the CoO nanosheets,
where the IL played a dual role as a solvent and a structure-guiding
agent.

electrocatalysts.

The phase and crystallinity
of the CoO sample prepared under ionothermal
conditions at 280 °C for 5 h (hereafter, denoted as CoO-280-5)
were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure 2A, the XRD diffraction
pattern is in good agreement with the standard hexagonal CoO (P63mc, PDF no. 80-0075), indicating
the existence of single hexagonal CoO phase.44 The peaks at around 31.7°, 34.4°, 36.2°, 47.5°,
56.5°, 62.8°, and 67.8° can be assigned to the (100),
(002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) crystal planes of hexagonal
CoO phase, respectively.45 The weak peak
intensities indicate low crystallinity,46 which is owing to the weak oxidation conditions. To further explore
the representative morphology of CoO-280-5, TEM image was obtained
(Figure 2B), which
demonstrated the formation of the well-defined 2D structure. More
importantly, the low contrast between the near transparent nanosheets
and background indicates that the CoO nanosheets are very thin. Further,
the atomic force microscopy analysis confirmed the nanosheet-like
morphology (Figure S1, thickness ≈
3–5 nm), where some nanosheets are composed of several parallel-stacked
ultrathin sheets. Such 2D nanosheets can not only provide numerous
electroactive sites but also result in shorter ion-diffusion pathways
and larger contact area with the electrolyte. Thus, these CoO nanosheets
are promising candidates as electrocatalysts for OER.31

image of the CoO-280-5.

To investigate the fabrication process of the CoO nanosheets,
a
time-dependent study was carried out. Two samples were prepared under
conditions similar to CoO-280-5, except the reaction times were 1
h for CoO-280-1 and 2 h for CoO-280-2. Subsequent, powder X-ray analysis
revealed (Figure 3A)
that both samples have the same hexagonal CoO phase similar to CoO-280-5
(P63mc, PDF no. 80-0075)
but with much poorer crystallinity. The TEM analysis of CoO-280-1
indicated an aggregated structure with very few inconspicuous primary
sheets in the outer region (Figure 3B), whereas these nanosheets were grown much denser
and distant in the case of CoO-280-2 (Figure 3C). Furthermore, many nanosheets started
exfoliating from the aggregates. Upon increasing the reaction time
to 5 h, the well-defined 2D nanosheets were formed, as shown in Figure 2B (i.e., CoO-280-5).
On the basis of the aforementioned results, the growth process of
the CoO nanosheets may be inferred as follows: at the initial stage,
the cobalt oxide nanoparticles generated and aggregated to form congeries.
However, owing to the sorption of [BMIM][NTf2] on the particles,
the aggregate of the particles is metastable. It is well-known that
1,3-dialkylimidazolium-based ILs are able to self-organize into polymeric
supramolecular structures which can act as the template for the formation
of the sheetlike architectures.39,47−49 Therefore, the nanoparticles relocated to sheet structure gradually.
Thus, the primary nanosheets come into being in the outer region of
the congeries, as shown in Figure 3B. With the prolongation of the reaction time, the
aggregated particles are consumed and the CoO nanosheets are formed
finally.

Figure 3 (A) XRD patterns and TEM images of (B) CoO-280-1 and (C) CoO-280-2,
respectively.

As the stability and
viscosity of ILs are significantly affected
by the temperature, we investigated the influence of reaction temperature
in our case by preparing samples at another four different temperatures
(250, 300, 330, and 350 °C) by keeping the time period and other
reaction conditions intact. The XRD results (Figure 4) suggested that when the reaction temperature
was below 300 °C, the products are mainly cobalt oxide, whereas
at 330 °C or higher, the products became the mixtures of cobalt
sulfides (Co9S8 and Co3S4) and cobalt oxide. The product obtained at 250 °C (CoO-250-5)
has a very poor crystallinity, almost amorphous in nature. For the
samples obtained at 330 °C (CoxSy-330-5) and 350 °C (CoxSy-350-5), the peaks at 2θ
= 29.8°, 31.2°, and 52.1° belong to the (311), (222),
and (440) planes of Co9S8 (PDF no. 65-6801),
respectively. Also, the peaks at 26.7° and 55° can be assigned,
respectively, to the (220) and (440) planes of another cobalt sulfide—Co3S4 (PDF no. 42-1448). However, the peaks at 34.1°
can be indexed to the (111) plane of the CoO. The generation of cobalt
sulfides can be attributed to the partial decomposition of [BMIM][NTf2] at high temperatures, which serves as a sulfur source for
the cobalt sulfides.

Figure 4 XRD patterns of CoO-250-5, CoO-300-5, CoxSy-330-5, and CoxSy-350-5, respectively.

The decomposition of [BMIM][NTf2] at
high temperatures
will inevitably lead to damped function on structure engineering,
which will be confirmed by the TEM analysis. The TEM image of CoO-250-5
(Figure 5A) consists
of aggregated structures only because of the high viscosity of [BMIM][NTf2] and the low-reaction temperature which restricts the growth
of the nanosheets. Although in the case of CoO-300-5 (Figure 5B), a stacked morphology composed
of several parallel-stacked sheets is observed. This is due to the
diminished protection of [BMIM][NTf2] for the nanosheets
at high temperature. The initial-formed CoO nanosheets are unable
to keep dispersed owing to the decreased viscous nature of [BMIM][NTf2] or insufficient adsorption of [BMIM][NTf2] on
the nanosheets. When the ionothermal temperature is increased further
to 330 °C and 350 °C, that is, in the cases of CoxSy-330-5 and CoxSy-350-5, respectively,
cobalt sulfides were produced and the nanosheets are thicker and cracked
down, as shown in Figure 5C and 5D, respectively. These results
demonstrate that when the reaction temperature is higher than 300
°C, the stabilizing and structure-guiding functionality of [BMIM][NTf2] wears off.

(D) CoxSy-350-5,
respectively.

To determine the surface
chemical states of the constituents in
the products, CoO-280-5 and CoxSy-350-5 were subjected to XPS (X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy) analysis. Figure 6A–C shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p
region, O 1s region, and S 2p region of CoO-280-5, respectively. The
Co 2p spectrum exhibits two prominent peaks at 780.4 and 797.4 eV
corresponding to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks
of CoO. The peaks at 785 and 803.4 eV correspond to the satellites
of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2.50−52 The peaks at
529.6 and 532.7 eV in O 1s spectrum are attributed to the lattice
Co–O of CoO and the hydroxyl groups on the surface.53 The peak located at 531.1 eV is associated with
oxygen vacancies. When the ultrathin sheets structure and weak oxidation
environment are taken into account, it is reasonable that the nanosheets
are rich in defects.31,54,55 The peaks located at 162, 164.9 can be indexed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of C–S group, respectively; in addition,
the peaks at 167.8 and 170.3 eV in S 2p region belong to the S–O
group. The above superficial groups may be derived from the surface
adsorption or carbonization of [BMIM][NTf2]. For CoxSy-350-5, the
high-resolution XPS spectrum of Co 2p region was presented in Figure 6D. The peaks at 778.8
and 796.4 eV can be ascribed to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co9S8, suggesting the existence
of Co9S8 phase.56 The peaks at 779.8 and 793.4 eV were derived from Co2+ and Co3+ of Co3S4.57 The peaks at 785 and 802 eV are satellite peaks.58,59 The peak at 782.2 eV can be assigned to the Co–O.60,61 The S 2p XPS spectrum of CoxSy-350-5 can be deconvoluted into six peaks (Figure 6F). The peaks at
160.2 and 162.5 eV can be assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbital of Co9S8.56,62 The peaks at 160.4 and 164.5 eV corresponded to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 orbital of Co3S4.58 The peak at 167.8 and 171.1 eV can be indexed
to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of SOx, which may be owing to the surficial oxidation.63,64 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of O 1s region for CoxSy-350-5 (Figure 6E) also includes three peaks
corresponding to Co–O (529.6 eV), the hydroxyl groups on the
surface (533.0 eV), and the oxygen vacancies (531.2 eV). Thus, the
CoxSy-350-5
is a mixture of Co9S8, Co3S4, and surficial CoO, which is in good agreement with the XRD results.

and (F) S 2p region of CoO-350-5, respectively.

The OER catalytic activities of the electrocatalysts synthesized
at different temperatures were measured by linear scanning voltammetry
(LSV) method in 1 M aqueous KOH solution. Figure 7A shows the polarization curves of all of
the electrocatalysts studied for OER. The CoO nanosheets (CoO-280-5)
show the highest catalytic activity, which is close to commercial
RuO2. The corresponding overpotential at the current density
of 10 mA cm–2 is only 320 mV, which is lower than
that of CoO-250-5 (349 mV), CoO-300-5 (338 mV), CoxSy-330-5 (359 mV), and CoxSy-350-5(387 mV). The
OER kinetics of the studied electrocatalysts was estimated by using
Tafel plots derived from the corresponding polarization curves (Figure 7B). The Tafel slopes
are 60, 70, 83, 85, 95, and 97 mV dec–1 for RuO2, CoO-280-5, CoO-250-5, CoO-300-5, CoxSy-330-5, and CoxSy-350-5, respectively, which indicate
that the CoO nanosheets possess a faster OER kinetics. In addition,
the onset potential of the CoO-280-5 electrocatalyst is 1.472 V versus
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is also lower than that
of all of the other studied electrocatalysts (CoO-250-5: 1.534 V,
CoO-300-5: 1.517 V, CoxSy-330-5: 1.549 V, and CoxSy-350-5: 1.582 V). These results demonstrate that
the CoO nanosheets possess the highest electrocatalytic activity among
all of the studied electrocatalysts in this work. Furthermore, the
catalytic performance of CoO-280-5 is also superior to the majority
of the previously reported cobalt oxide and sulfide-based electrocatalysts,
as listed in Table S1. To better understand
the high OER catalytic activity of the nanosheets, the cyclic voltammetry
(CV) studies (Figure S2) were carried out
to determine the electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of the as-prepared
electrocatalysts. Among the estimated double-layer capacitances (Cdl) of all of the electrocatalysts (Figure 7C), CoO-280-5 exhibited
the highest value (26.5 mF cm–2). On the basis of
the linear relationship between the Cdl and ECSA, we can conclude that the CoO-280-5 nanosheets possess
more exposed active sites than the other studied electrocatalysts.
Thus, the high OER catalytic activity of the as-synthesized CoO-280-5
nanosheets can be explained as follows: on one hand, when compared
with the stacked nanosheets or bulk structure, the ultrathin nanosheet
structure can expose a large amount of superficial active sites; in
addition, the ultrathin nanosheets with poor crystallization possess
numerous defect sites, such as oxygen vacancies, edges, stacking faults,
and so forth, as shown in Figure 6B, which could serve as highly active species for enhanced
OER catalysis.65

curves, (B) corresponding Tafel slopes, and (C) Cdl estimation for assessment of electrochemical active
surface areas of the synthesized electrocatalysts, respectively; (D,E)
stability test of the CoO-280-5; all measurements were performed in
1 M aqueous KOH solution.

On the other hand, in comparison with the bulk phase, the
ultrathin
nanosheet structure not only offers a large effective surface area
for sufficient electrode-material/current-collector contact but also
decreases the length of the ion-diffusion paths and increases the
contact area between the surface of the electrocatalyst and the electrolyte,
which is favorable for an efficient mass transfer, especially the
escape of O2.66 Moreover, the
intimate electronic contact between the electrode and catalyst plays
an important role in determining the catalytic activity and durability;
compared with the bulk or stacked structure, the ultrathin nanosheets
are inclined to form most intimate contact with electrode, preventing
the detachment of the catalyst, which ensures the unhindered operation
of the electrode reaction.

As the stability is one of the prominent
factors in determining
the practicability of electrocatalysts, we probed CoO-280-5 by continuous
CV sweeps in 1 M aqueous KOH solution from 1.0 to 1.6 V versus RHE
at a scan rate of 50 mV/s and I–t measurements at 1.6 V versus RHE for 12 h. The polarization curve
(Figure 7D) shows a
slight decay in current density after 1000 continuous CV cycles. In
addition, the I–t measurements
(Figure 7E) indicated
an almost steady current density without any significant decay during
the 12 h of continual OER. However, in the end, a slight increase
in the current density resulted from desorption of the adsorbed IL.
These results suggest that the CoO-280-5 electrocatalyst possesses
notable stability which can be attributed to the close acquaintance
generated between the CoO nanosheets and the electrolyte.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully engineered
a high-performance
stable OER electrocatalyst (CoO-280-5), composed of hierarchical CoO
nanosheets prepared through a simple single-step IL-assisted reaction.
The structure-guiding nature of IL played a vital role in developing
the suitable nanosheet-like architecture for the electrocatalyst.
Its excellent OER performance is even comparable to the state-of-the-art
nonprecious metal electrocatalysts. Thus, this report provides a new
strategy for the fabrication and exploration of novel electrocatalysts.

acetylacetonate
(Co(acac)3) was purchased from Aladdin, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide
([BMIM][NTf2]) was bought from Lanzhou Greenchem and ILs
from LICP, CAS, China. Nafion solution (5 wt %) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Carbon cloth (CC) was provided by Ce Tech. Co., Ltd.
Commercial RuO2 (99.9%) was provided by Shanghai Macklin

4.2 Synthesis of Cobalt-Based Electrocatalysts
Prior to use, the [BMIM][NTf2] was degassed in vacuum
at 120 °C for 20 min. In a typical synthetic process, 50 mg of
Co(acac)3 and 1.0 g of [BMIM][NTf2] were mixed
in a glass bottle. Then, the glass bottle was placed into the tube
furnace and flushed with N2 gas for 20 min. Subsequently,
the temperature of the furnace was raised from room temperature to
280 °C with a rate of 2 °C/min and maintained at 280 °C
for 5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the precipitate was
washed with ethanol and distilled water for three times and then dried
in vacuum. To put an insight into the growth mechanism of the nanosheets,
two more samples were prepared through the same process and just maintained
at 280 °C for 1 or 2 h. For exploring the influence of the reaction
temperature, another four samples were prepared through the same process
just at different temperatures: 250, 300, 330, and 350 °C, respectively.

4.3 General Characterization
The powder
XRD patterns were measured using a Rigaku D/max-rc X-ray diffractometer
with Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation.
TEM was carried out on a JEM 1400 TEM operating at 120 KV. The XPS
analysis was tested on an ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer.

4.4 Electrochemical Test
The electrochemical
measurements were carried out on a CHI600B three-electrode electrochemical
workstation (Shanghai Chenhua, China) at room temperature. The saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) and carbon rod were used as the reference
electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. The electrocatalysts-loaded
CC was used as the working electrode. The potentials versus SCE in
this work was converted to an RHE according to the Nernst equation
(ERHE = ESCE + 0.059 pH + ESCE0), where ESCE0 is the standard potential of
SCE at 25 °C.12,42 Before to use, CC was cut into
rectangular pieces. Then, the CC pieces were cleaned by sonication
in acetone, deionized water, and ethanol for 30 min each and then
dried in vacuum.43 Electrocatalyst powder
(5 mg) was dispersed in the solution containing 900 μL of distilled
water and 100 μL of 5 wt % Nafion solution. Then, the mixture
was ultrasonicated for 10 min to form a homogeneous ink. Then, total
60 μL of the ink was dripped onto the CC and dried in vacuum
acting as the working electrode (the loading mass is about 1 mg/cm2). The OER activities of all of the synthesized electrocatalysts
were evaluated by the LSV in 1 M aqueous KOH solution with a potential
range from 1.2 to 1.7 V versus RHE and a scan rate of 5 mV/s. All
of the recorded polarization curves were iR corrected.
Before LSV measurement, CV was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV/s
in 1 M aqueous KOH solution from 1.0 to 1.6 V versus RHE for 20 cycles
to reach a stable current density. The durability test was performed
with a CV between 1.2 and 1.7 V versus RHE for 1000 continuous cycles.
The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were estimated
through CV at the potential between 1.1 and 1.2 V versus RHE with
scan rates of 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 mV/s.
