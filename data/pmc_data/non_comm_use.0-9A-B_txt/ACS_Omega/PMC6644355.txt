Microcrystals
composed of the conjugated organic molecule perylene
can be encapsulated beneath single-layer graphene using mild conditions.
Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy images show that the
graphene exists as a conformal coating on top of the crystal. Raman
spectroscopy indicates that the graphene is only slightly perturbed
by the underlying crystal, probably due to strain. The graphene layer
provides complete protection from a variety of solvents and prevents
sublimation of the crystal at elevated temperatures. Time-resolved
photoluminescence measurements do not detect any quenching of the
perylene emission by the graphene layer, although nonradiative energy
transfer within a few nanometers of the crystal–graphene interface
cannot be ruled out. The ability to encapsulate samples on a substrate
under a graphene monolayer may provide a new way to access and interact
with the organic crystal under ambient conditions.

Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D)
materials have attracted the attention of
researchers due to their novel physical properties, such as ultrahigh
carrier mobilities, thermal conductivity, and mechanical toughness.1,2 As a prototypical 2D material, graphene has been the subject of
extensive study. This atomically thin membrane allows photons, electrons,
and even protons to pass through but is impermeable to other chemical
species, even those as small as atomic helium.3−6 This impermeability has raised
interest in the application of graphene as a protective coating, e.g.,
to prevent corrosion of an underlying metal.7 Typically, these coatings consist of many overlapping flakes of
graphene such that there is not complete encapsulation, but rather
a slowing of the diffusion as the reactive species navigate around
the sheets.

Reports of complete encapsulation of objects using
graphene are
relatively rare. Several groups have used graphene to encapsulate
liquid samples for electron microscopy experiments,8−10 but these methods
are challenging to implement, since they rely on using a pair of sheets
to sandwich a liquid droplet. Ideally, one would develop a method
whereby individual microscale objects on a solid support can be “shrink-wrapped”
by an atomically thin sheet of graphene, making them impervious to
chemical attack while still allowing optical and/or electrical access.
The encapsulation of metal nanowires between graphene and plastic
using hot lamination suggests that such an approach is feasible.11 However, a more general encapsulation method
using milder conditions on an inorganic surface would be desirable
for organics. Ideally, graphene would make an atomically tight seal
with an inert substrate such as glass.

Crystals composed of
conjugated organic molecules make a good test
system for graphene encapsulation. These crystals possess interesting
electronic and photophysical properties,12 with those based on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons being of special
interest.13,14 They tend to be sensitive to the presence
of impurities like O2 or organic contaminants, which can
degrade their electronic properties. Organic crystals also dissolve
when exposed to organic solvents and sublime when exposed to high
vacuum or elevated temperatures. Current protection strategies include
isolating them under vacuum or an inert atmosphere and encapsulating
them between glass plates sealed with epoxy. In both cases, the crystal
becomes inaccessible to electrical or optical probes that require
close sample contact like scanning probe microscopies.

This
study describes a method to encapsulate single microcrystals
composed of the prototypical conjugated organic molecule perylene
(PER) beneath monolayer graphene. While graphene has been used previously
as a substrate for organic crystal growth,15,16 its use as an encapsulation layer is relatively unexplored. We used
PER as a test crystal because its α-polymorph tends to grow
in a signature square shape and produces a strong visible photoluminescence
(PL) signal. These characteristics allow us to optically detect the
presence of these crystals underneath graphene sheet and assess how
they respond to solvent exposure and elevated temperatures. The effect
of graphene layer on the PER excimer dynamics can be measured by the
photoluminescence (PL) decay. Our results demonstrate that a 2D monolayer
can completely encapsulate a molecular crystal and turn it into a
sample that is robust with respect to air and solvent exposure as
well as high temperatures. This new capability to protect fragile
crystals should open the door to routine characterization of these
fragile semiconductors using microscopy techniques with nanometer
resolution,17 as well as new ways to interface
them with other materials.

Results and Discussion
The procedure
for coating PER microcrystals with graphene is outlined
in Figure 1 and described
in detail in the Supporting Information.18 Briefly, large-area single-layer graphene
sheets grown on a Cu foil substrate by chemical vapor deposition are
purchased from a commercial vendor. A cellulose acetate polymer layer
with a thickness of several microns is spin-cast on top of the graphene
and then the Cu is dissolved in a solution of HCl/H2O2. After the Cu layer is completely etched away, the solution
is replaced with clean water and the graphene–polymer layer
is floated on the water surface. A glass substrate, on top of which
random PER microcrystals have been grown by solvent evaporation, is
then dipped into the water and positioned underneath the supported
graphene. It is then lifted up with the graphene layer on top. The
end result is a sample consisting of the glass substrate with PER
crystals underneath a blanket of graphene with the polymer support
layer on top. The final step involves dissolving the polymer-supporting
layer by rinsing with acetone. The presence of graphene can be readily
discerned by its modified reflectivity, and it is easy to see breaks
and holes in the coating (Supporting Information). Most of the original PER microcrystals are dissolved by the acetone
rinse, but in regions containing intact graphene sheets, the underlying
PER crystals can be readily imaged using optical, electron, and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) methods.

encapsulation process for
molecular microcrystals.

Figure 2a,b
shows
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PER crystals under single-layer
graphene. We note that this imaging was done without a metal coating,
since graphene’s high conductivity prevents charging of the
low-conductivity organic crystal and enables electron microscopy to
be performed under vacuum without further treatment. In Figure 2b, one can see a wrinkle in
the graphene sheet that continues from the substrate across the edge
and onto the crystal surface. This wrinkling was an exception; in
almost all other cases, close adhesion of the graphene sheet to the
crystal and glass surfaces led to a conformal coating. There is no
sign of “tenting”, in which the graphene sheet detaches
from the surface and is free floating between the crystal and the
surface. Tenting was observed for taller or more irregularly shaped
objects such as inorganic dust particles adhered to the substrate
surface (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The conformal nature of the encapsulation was confirmed by atomic
force microscopy (AFM). Figure 2c shows an AFM image of a pair of encapsulated crystals, while Figure 2d shows the height
profile of the crystals taken along the axis shown in Figure 2c. The profile image in Figure 2d illustrates the
size variation in the PER crystal plates, whose thickness typically
ranged from 100 to 200 nm. The images also show how the graphene conforms
to the crystal, following the sharp crystal edge down to the substrate
surface.

Figure 2 (a,b) SEM images of graphene covered PER crystals on glass with
low and high magnification. Note that the continuation of the graphene
wrinkles from the substrate
surface across the PER crystal in (b) provides visual evidence the
encapsulation. (c) AFM image of graphene covered perylene crystals
with (d) cross section analysis. The typical diameter of the covered
crystals is around 2 μm and the thickness is around 150 nm.

Raman spectroscopy is a standard
method to evaluate the quality
of graphene layers.19Figure 3 compares the Raman spectra
of graphene on top of both the SiO2 substrate and a PER
crystal. Both Raman spectra show the signature G peak in the range
of 1580–1590 cm–1 and the 2D peak at around
2600 cm–1. The G/2D peak intensity ratio (IG/I2D < 1) indicates
monolayer coverage. The small amplitude of the D peak at 1300 cm–1 for the graphene layer on SiO2 shows that
it is largely free of defects.19 The Raman
spectrum on the PER does not appear to have an enhanced D peak intensity,
suggesting that it has the same low defect level, but two additional
peaks at 1297 and 1369 cm–1 also appear on top of
this feature. These peaks are also prominent in the Raman spectrum
of PER microcrystals (Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4) and originate from the PER double-bond
stretches.20,21 It is interesting that the PER
and graphene Raman signals are of comparable strength. The 780 nm
excitation wavelength is far from the PER absorption at 500 nm but
still resonant with the semimetallic graphene. The very strong Raman
signal of the delocalized electrons in graphene more than compensates
for its lower mass fraction in this sample.

Figure 3 Raman spectra of graphene films on glass substrate (black)
and
on top of a PER crystal (red). The excitation wavelength is 780 nm.
Both spectra show the characteristic graphene peaks: G and 2D peaks.
Red shifts for both G (−8 cm–1) and 2D (−18
cm–1) peaks are observed for the graphene on top
of the PER crystal, along with additional peaks at 1297 and 1369 cm–1 from the PER.

The exact positions of the G and 2D peaks can provide information
about the state of the graphene. In pristine graphene, the G peak
is located at 1580 cm–1. The G peak of our graphene
on glass is located at 1589 cm–1, consistent with
doping by exposure to ambient O2 after preparation in air.22,23 The Raman spectrum of graphene on top of PER exhibits a slight downshift
in both the G (−8 cm–1) and 2D (−18
cm–1) peaks relative to those of graphene on SiO2. Larger PER crystals resulted in larger downshifts of the
Raman peaks, with the largest crystal shifting the G peak all the
way to 1570 cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S5). These larger G peak shifts were accompanied
by larger 2D peak shifts up to 25 cm–1. These shifts
were robust with respect to background subtraction and data reduction
methods.

There are several factors that can lead to shifting
Raman peaks
in graphene. Both n- and p-doping typically lead to an upshift of
the G-band Raman frequencies,24 but this
is the opposite of what we observe. Given that the graphene sheet
is already p-doped due to oxygen exposure, one possibility is that
the organic crystal removes charge carriers or O2 from
the graphene sheets. Such an undoping process would be expected to
shift the G peak back to 1580 cm–1, but not below.
The fact that we observe shifts of both G and 2D peaks to positions
well below those of pristine graphene suggests that the more likely
culprit is strain as the graphene stretches to accommodate the underlying
crystal. The shifts in both G and 2D peaks are consistent with a strain
of approximately 0.5% on a crystal with thickness of about 150 nm,
based on previous measurements on stretched sheets of graphene.25,26 This stretching would explain the conformal nature of the coating
deduced from the images in Figure 2 and is consistent with the “shrink-wrap”
concept. The Raman shifts provide evidence that the interaction of
graphene with the underlying crystal induces a slight stretching but
no dramatic changes in the electronic structure or defect density.
It is possible, however, that the graphene sheet experiences higher
localized strain at the crystal edges, which could lead to larger
effects on its electronic properties.27

PER is a highly soluble small molecule that sublimes easily,
but
the graphene–glass encapsulation stabilizes the microcrystals
under a variety of conditions. The samples can be left on the benchtop,
under room light, for days without any change in PL brightness. The
encapsulated crystals survive immersion in a variety of organic solvents
(acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, methanol, and methylene
chloride) for more than 1 day without change. Unprotected crystals
dissolved within 1 min under the same conditions. When heated to 100
°C in air, unprotected crystals sublimed within 40 min, but encapsulated
crystals resisted sublimation up to 250 °C, close to PER’s
melting point of 278 °C. At higher temperatures, the PER melted
and then rapidly disappeared. Comparisons of graphene-protected and
unprotected PER crystals after exposure to solvent and elevated temperatures
are shown in Figure 4. The fact that the graphene sheet provides protection from solvent
dissolution and sublimation is evidence that the graphene makes an
atomically tight seal with the glass substrate that completely prevents
penetration by solvent molecules as well as escape of the PER molecules
at elevated temperatures. The encapsulation only failed when the PER
itself could diffuse (after melting) or if the graphene did not remain
intact. Objects with large height variations tended to rupture the
graphene (Supporting Information, Figure S1), allowing solvent penetration and dissolution.

Figure 4 Transmitted and fluorescence
microscopy images showing the effect
of monolayer graphene encapsulation on the stability of PER microcrystals.
The substrates are standard microscope slides with gold alignment
marks. (a) Before and after washing with THF: 30 s washing resulted
in 100% dissolution of unprotected crystals, while 20 min THF washing
had no effect on protected crystals. (b) Before and after heating
at 100 °C for 40 min: the unprotected crystals sublime completely,
but the protected crystals remain intact. The scale bar is 50 μm.

Graphene is not a completely inert
coating, since it is a semimetal
that may be expected to affect the electronic properties of the crystal.
For example, it is likely to quench molecular excitons due to either
energy28−30 or electron transfer.31,32 Although the
precise distance dependence and mechanism of the PL quenching remain
a subject of active investigation, the characteristic distance has
been estimated to extend up to 60 nm.33 To investigate the possibility of PL quenching, the excimer lifetime
of the PER microcrystals was measured by time-resolved PL experiments.
The PL spectra with and without graphene encapsulation are similar,
showing the Y (550 nm) and E (600 nm) peaks as observed in α-PER
crystals (Supporting Information, Figure S6).34 The Y peak in our samples is more
pronounced than for typical bulk crystals,35,36 as often observed for nanocrystalline samples with higher defect
densities.37,38 The PL decays of the two samples
are identical, as shown in Figure 5a, although the signal level of the encapsulated sample
is considerably lower due to the scarcity of surviving crystals. We
note that these PER crystals, grown from solution, have a more rapid
PL decay than sublimation-grown crystals from zone-refined PER.34 It is likely that the PL decay is accelerated
by the presence of defects in our solution-grown PER crystals. But
the important point is that there is no detectable PL quenching by
the graphene overlayer.

Figure 5 (a) Time-resolved photoluminescence of PER (black)
and graphene-coated
PER crystals (red) excited at 400 nm. The lifetime of crystalline
PER is unchanged when coated with graphene. (b) Calculated PL decays
for different R0 values for the graphene
quenching function described in the text for a 150 nm thick crystal.
When R0 ≥ 20 nm, there is a notable
deviation from the intrinsic PER decay.

Even though there is no detectable change in the PL decay,
it is
likely that excitons near the top surface of the crystal, close to
the graphene layer, are quenched. We can place an approximate upper
bound on the quenching radius of the graphene using a simple model
to analyze the PL decay. We assume an average crystal thickness of
150 nm and that the quenching rate of the 2D graphene sheet is given
by , where R0 is
the critical distance for a dipole interacting with a 2D energy acceptor.39,40 The experimental PL decay is parameterized as a biexponential with
amplitudes A1 = 0.925 and A2 = 0.075 and decay times τ1 = 7.5 ns
and τ2 = 17.4 ns. The functional form of the PL decay
is then the product of the intrinsic biexponential and the quenching
term 1  In Figure 5b, we compare the PL decays calculated assuming
different
values of R0 and summing up the contributions
of eq 1 for all R values in a 150 nm thick crystal. For R0 = 20 nm, the deviation of the calculated decay from
the intrinsic decay should be observable. Similar results are obtained
for crystal thicknesses of 100 and 200 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S8). The fact that this deviation is not
experimentally observed allows us to estimate a conservative upper
bound of R0 ≤ 20 nm. This limit
is consistent with a value of R0 ∼
10 nm extracted from distance-dependent quenching of a rhodamine dye
on top of graphene41 and suggests that
only excitons in the top layer of the PER crystal are quenched by
the graphene.

The ability to observe electronic perturbations
due to graphene
will depend on the nature of the organic sample. In PER, the effect
of the graphene quenching may be more easily observed for thinner
crystals that have a larger fraction of molecules close to the surface
or for higher-quality crystals that can support longer exciton diffusion
lengths. Different types of crystals may have significant electronic
interactions with the graphene layer, for example, charge transfer.
Surface-sensitive measurements of the electronic properties will likely
be sensitive to the graphene–organic interaction. A second
issue is that the method of preparation exposes the sample to water
during the graphene lift up. While the graphene clearly prevents access
by molecules outside the encapsulation layer, it can also trap impurities
or water molecules inside the layer with the crystal. The stability
of the graphene-encapsulated sample will allow such effects to be
studied for samples that might be sensitive to the presence of such
extrinsic chemical species.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
demonstrated that it is possible to create
robust molecular crystal samples that are fully encapsulated beneath
a monolayer of graphene. The graphene layer provides complete protection
from a variety of solvents and prevents sublimation of the crystal
at elevated temperatures. Raman measurements show that the graphene
layer is only slightly perturbed by the underlying crystal, while
time-resolved PL measurements show no detectable quenching of the
PER excimers by the graphene. The fact that graphene can make a tight
seal with glass suggests that this method can be extended to other
2D encapsulating materials, for example, hexagonal boron nitride,
whose large band gap would preclude any possibility of energy transfer.
This technique may also make it possible to interface organic crystals
with other materials that have incompatible processing conditions
like metal electrodes created by focused ion beam deposition under
high vacuum or polymers cast from solvents that would normally dissolve
the crystal. The ability to keep organic solid crystals intact under
such processing conditions raises the possibility of fabricating an
organic–organic heterojunction to study energy transfer and/or
charge transfer across a 2D membrane.
