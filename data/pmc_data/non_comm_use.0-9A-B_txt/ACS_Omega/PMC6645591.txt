In
Li–CO2 battery, due to the highly insulating
nature of the discharge product of Li2CO3, the
battery needs to be charged at a high charge overpotential, leading
to severe cathode and electrolyte instability and hence poor battery
cycle performance. Developing efficient cathode catalysts to effectively
reduce the charge overpotential represents one of key challenges to
realize practical Li–CO2 batteries. Here, we report
the use of monodispersed Ru nanoparticles functionalized graphene
nanosheets as cathode catalysts in Li–CO2 battery
to significantly lower the charge overpotential for the electrochemical
decomposition of Li2CO3. In our battery, a low
charge voltage of 4.02 V, a high Coulomb efficiency of 89.2%, and
a good cycle stability (67 cycles at a 500 mA h/g limited capacity)
are achieved. It is also found that O2 plays an essential
role in the discharge process of the rechargeable Li–CO2 battery. Under the pure CO2 environment, Li–CO2 battery exhibits negligible discharge capacity; however,
after introducing 2% O2 (volume ratio) into CO2, the O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery can
deliver a high capacity of 4742 mA h/g. Through an in situ quantitative
differential electrochemical mass spectrometry investigation, the
final discharge product Li2CO3 is proposed to
form via the reaction 4Li+ + 2CO2 + O2 + 4e– → 2Li2CO3.
Our results validate the essential role of O2 and can help
deepen the understanding of the discharge and charge reaction mechanisms
of the Li–CO2 battery.

Introduction
Lithium–air
(Li–air) battery has been considered
as a promising alternative to power electric vehicles using renewable
electricity due to its extremely high theoretical energy storage capacity.1−4 One practical issue is to develop the Li–air battery that
can work efficiently even in the CO2-contaminated O2 environment. Therefore, intensive research efforts have been
devoted to the investigation of the working mechanism of lithium–oxygen
(Li–O2) battery in the presence of CO2, as well as the development of the so-called lithium–CO2 (Li–CO2) battery.5−15 Li–CO2 battery was investigated by Archer et al.
at various temperatures, and found that high temperature can promote
the battery discharge process.7 The room
temperature rechargeable Li–CO2 battery was realized
by Liu et al., with commercial Ketjen black cathode, exhibiting a
capacity of 1032 mA h/g at a current density of 30 mA/g.6 Owing to the structural advantages, carbon nanotubes
and graphene were also introduced into the Li–CO2 batteries as cathode materials, displaying high discharge capacities
of 5786 and 6600 mA h/g at the current density of 100 mA/g, respectively.5,16 Similar to the insulating discharge product of Li2O2 in the Li–O2 battery that usually leads
to a high charge overpotential, the development of Li–CO2 battery encounters the same challenge. As a wide band gap
insulator, the discharge product of Li2CO3 is
difficult to be fully decomposed or usually be decomposed at very
high potentials,17−20 thereby resulting in a series of issues such as low energy efficiency,
low Coulombic efficiency, electrolyte decomposition, and poor cycle
stability.21,22 Hence, it is crucial to rationally
design advanced cathode catalysts to effectively decompose Li2CO3 with a low charge overpotential.

For
the Li–CO2 battery, it was proposed to work
via a reversible reaction of 4Li + 3CO2 → 2Li2CO3 + C.10 However,
in other studies, the cells delivered negligible discharge capacity
in the pure CO2 atmosphere.8,23 Takechi et
al. reported that only a very limited capacity of 66 mA h/g was delivered,
but a high capacity of ∼4000 mA h/g could be achieved by introducing
10% O2 (volume ratio) into CO2. It was suggested
that during the discharge process, CO2 cannot be directly
electrochemically reduced, instead, O2 was first reduced
to superoxide anion radical (O2•–) and then rapidly consumed
by CO2 to achieve a high discharge capacity.8 Therefore, it is still controversial whether
CO2 electrochemical reduction exists in the Li–CO2 battery. Therefore, more systematic studies are needed to
unveil the working mechanism of Li–CO2 battery.

In this work, we develop the graphene nanosheets functionalized
with monodispersed Ru nanoparticles with an average size of 2 nm as
efficient cathode catalyst to effectively promote the decomposition
of Li2CO3 at a low charge potential of 4.02
V, thereby achieving a relatively high Coulombic efficiency and a
good cycle stability. We also investigate the discharge and charge
reaction mechanism of Li–CO2 and O2-assisted
Li–CO2 batteries. Our results confirm the essential
role of O2 in Li–CO2 batteries during
the discharge process, where O2 is first electrochemically
reduced at the cathode and further chemically reacts with CO2 to form the discharge product of Li2CO3 as
derived from an in situ quantitative differential electrochemical
mass spectrometry (DEMS) analysis of the O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery.

Results and Discussion
The as-prepared
Ru/GNSs possess a typical porous wrinkle-like structure
as revealed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
image in Figure 1a.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1b,c) indicate that Ru nanoparticles are homogeneously
dispersed on GNSs with an average size of about 2 nm. As shown in
the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in the inset of Figure 1c, the spacing between adjacent
fringes is ca. 0.21 nm, corresponding to the (101) lattice spacing
of Ru. This can be further confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
result in Figure S1, where the broad peak
at around 24° can be indexed to the diffraction peak (002) of
the reduced graphene oxide and other peaks to the metallic Ru.24,25 The specific surface area of Ru/GNSs is determined to be 121.05
m2/g from the N2 adsorption–desorption
measurement (Figure S2a). A bimodal pore
size distribution located at 6 is observed (Figure S2a, inset), which can effectively promote efficient electrolyte
impregnation and gas/Li+ diffusion.26,27 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman measurements were
further used to characterize the Ru-functionalized GNSs (Figures S3 and S2b). The Ru content in Ru/GNSs
hybrid is 54 wt %, as determined by the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) measurement (Figure S2c).

Ru/GNSs. (b, c) TEM images of Ru/GNSs at different
magnifications. Inset in (c) is the corresponding HRTEM image of a
single Ru particle, with the white scale bar of 2 nm.

Batteries were measured under three different atmospheres,
i.e.,
pure CO2, CO2 with 2% O2 (Figure 2), and pure O2 (Figure S4). CO2 was
purified by Agilent gas clean system to minimize the influence of
H2O and O2 (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 50 ppb). Under the pure CO2 environment,
negligible discharge capacity is obtained for both Ru/GNSs and the
bare GNSs cathodes. By introducing 2% O2 into CO2, the batteries with Ru/GNSs and bare GNSs cathodes exhibit a high
discharge capacity of 4742 and 5385 mA h/g, respectively. In this
context, the battery is termed O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery. As shown in Figure 2, both batteries show a voltage plateau of 2.76 V on
discharge, similar to that of Ru/GNSs in the pure O2 (Figure S4). During the recharge process, the
O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery with Ru/GNSs
exhibits a low charge voltage of 4.02 V. Moreover, 4230 mA h/g capacity
(89.2%) can be recharged at a low cutoff voltage of 4.2 V; in contrast,
for the battery with bare GNSs, only 1721 mA h/g (31.9%) capacity
can be recharged even at a high cutoff voltage of 4.5 V. This comparison
indicates that Ru nanoparticles can effectively promote the decomposition
of the discharge product in the O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery. At a high current density of 0.16 mA/cm2, the battery with Ru/GNSs can still deliver a discharge capacity
of 3865 mA h/g, with an average voltage of 2.67 V, and a charge capacity
of 3000 mA h/g, with an average voltage of 4.10 V (Figure S5).

CO2 and CO2 with 2% O2 atmospheres
at a current density of 0.08 mA/cm2.

The discharge product of the O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery using Ru/GNSs is mainly comprised of Li2CO3, as evidenced by the appearance of a peak at 1086
cm–1 in the Raman profile in Figure 3a, XRD patterns in Figure 3b, and Li 1s peak with a binding energy at
55.7 eV in Figure 3c after discharge.24,28,29 It is also found that the discharge product of Li2CO3 can be almost fully decomposed during the charge process,
as revealed by the disappearance of these Li2CO3-related features in Raman/XRD/XPS spectra in Figure 3 after the full charge process. This suggests
that Ru/GNSs are effective electrochemical catalysts to decompose
Li2CO3.

Li 1s XPS spectra
of Ru/GNSs cathode cycled in CO2 with 2% O2 atmosphere
at different states.

The morphology evolution of Ru/GNSs cathode during the discharge/charge
processes was investigated by FESEM (Figure 4). Upon half discharge, the discharge product
of Li2CO3 appears as sheet-like aggregations
decorated on the cathode (Figure 4b). The discharge product completely covers the cathode
surface and evolves into floccule-like morphology after a full discharge
process (Figure 4c).
This morphology is completely different from the filmlike morphology
of Li2O2 for the Ru/GNSs cathode in the pure
O2 atmosphere (Li–O2 battery) operated
under the same current density (Figure 5). After the charge process, the cathode restores to
its original morphology (Figure 4d), suggesting the almost full decomposition of the
discharge product of Li2CO3.

To explore the discharge and charge
working mechanisms of the O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery with the Ru/GNSs
cathode, in situ DEMS was conducted to monitor the O2 and
CO2 consumption/evolution rate during a discharge/recharge
cycle with a fixed capacity of 50 mA h/g at a constant current of
0.4 mA for both discharge and charge processes, as shown in Figure 6. The simultaneous
consumption of O2 and CO2 is observed throughout
the whole discharge process (Figure 6a), and the consumption ratio of O2/CO2 is quantified to be about 0.44, close to 0.5 (Table 1). During the discharge process
in the presence of O2, it is proposed that O2 can be first electrochemically reduced at the cathode to form Li2O2, which further chemically reacts with CO2 forming the thermodynamically more stable Li2CO3 (2Li2O2 + 2CO2 →
2Li2CO3 + O2). In another pathway,
CO2 can react with the intermediate O2– and finally form Li2CO3.30 For both proposed mechanisms, O2 is the only
oxidant to catalyze the discharge reaction, and hence the discharge
reaction can be described as 4Li+ + 2CO2 + O2 + 4e– → 2Li2CO3, with the overall O2/CO2 consumption ratio
of 0.5.18 This coincides well with our
DEMS result.

capacity of 50 mA h/g at a constant current of 0.4 mA.

cathodes. D: discharge; R: recharge; C: consumption of gas during

As shown in Figure 6b, during the charge process, CO2 is released at a nearly
constant rate of about 2 × 10–3 μmol/s,
but there is no apparent release of O2 during the whole
charge process. By comparing the rate of CO2 consumption
and evolution during a full discharge/charge cycle, CO2 recovery efficiency is quantified to be ca. 0.98 (Table 1). Three Li2CO3 decomposition pathways have been proposed in previous studies.10,31 The oxidative reaction (2Li2CO3 → 4Li+ + 4e– + O2 + 2CO2) can be first ruled out because no O2 is detected during
the whole charge process. For the second pathway, 2Li2CO3 + C → 4Li+ + 3CO2 + 4e–, with the ratio between CO2 evolution during charge and
CO2 consumption during discharge being 1.5, is inconsistent
with the CO2 recovery efficiency (0.98) from the DEMS result.
As the third possibility, Li2CO3 can be decomposed
into CO2 and O2•–, and the generated O2•– can be further consumed via reactions with the electrolyte, as demonstrated
in a previous study.31 In this case, CO2 evolution rate during charge process is equal to the CO2 consumption rate during discharge process, in good agreement
with our DEMS result (0.98).

We further evaluate the cycle ability
of the O2-assisted
Li–CO2 batteries. 3178 mA h/g (67%) capacity can
be retained at the third cycle (Figure S6a) in the case of Ru/GNSs, with a nearly complete decomposition of
Li2CO3 in the cycling potential window. In contrast,
a very low capacity of 206 mA h/g is obtained at the third discharge
process (Figure S6b) for the bare GNSs
due to the cathode passivation induced by the accumulation of the
undecomposed Li2CO3 (Figure S7). The cycle stability is then evaluated by employing the
widely adopted capacity-limiting method.32,33 As shown in Figure 7, when the capacity is limited at 500 mA h/g, the O2-assisted
Li–CO2 battery with Ru/GNSs cathode can be operated
for 67 cycles at a current density of 0.16 mA/cm2, which
is superior to the battery with the bare GNSs cathode (12 cycles).
It demonstrates that Ru nanoparticles enhance recyclability via promoting
the deposition/decomposition of Li2CO3. It has
been reported that Ru is able to efficiently oxidize LiOH at low voltages.34 Therefore, Ru can be considered as a promising
catalyst for practical Li–air batteries operated in ambient
air, where Li2O2, LiOH, and Li2CO3 coexist as discharge products.35−37

(a) Ru/GNSs and (b) GNSs cathode in CO2 with 2% O2 atmosphere at a limited capacity of
500 mA h/g.

Causes of battery failure
after 67 cycles are scrutinized. After
disassembling the battery at the 60th cycle, the cathode surface is
covered by undecomposed side products (Figure S8). These side products originate from the decomposition of
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolyte caused by the superoxide anion
radicals O2•– during cycling. Although some of them can be decomposed upon recharge,
side products increase upon recharge due to the electrolyte decomposition
at high potentials, as previously reported.21,38,39 The continuous consumption of electrolyte
and the accumulation of side products together result in battery deterioration.21 Therefore, it is crucial to further search for
a more stable electrolyte for the Li–O2 and O2-assisted Li–CO2 batteries.

Conclusions
In summary, monodispersed Ru nanoparticles functionalized graphene
nanosheets have been employed as cathode catalysts in the rechargeable
O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery. It is found
that O2 plays an essential role in the realization of the
rechargeable Li–CO2 battery. Only with the existence
of O2 (2% in this study) can the Li–CO2 battery deliver an impressive discharge capacity of 4742 mA h/g,
with a discharge voltage of 2.76 V at a current density of 0.08 mA/cm2; in contrast, under the pure CO2 environment,
the battery can hardly work. Through in situ DEMS measurements, we
propose that during the discharge process, O2 is first
electrochemically reduced to form the intermediate O2•– or Li2O2, which further chemically reacts with CO2 to form the final discharge product of Li2CO3. With the help of Ru nanoparticles, the discharge product of Li2CO3 can be electrochemically decomposed at a relatively
low charge potential of 4.02 V (0.08 mA/cm2 current density),
and the battery can operate for 67 cycles at a limited capacity of
500 mA h/g (0.16 mA/cm2 current density). Our results provide
new understandings of the Li–CO2 batteries and new
insights into the O2 electrochemistry in the Li–CO2 batteries with noble metal catalysts.

Experimental Section
Material
Synthesis
Ru/GNSs were prepared by an impregnation
method followed by heat treatment in 5% H2/Ar gas. Typically,
51.5 mg RuCl3·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 4 mL graphene oxide (GO, 5 g/L from graphene supermarket) were
dispersed in deionized water with constant stirring and sonication.
The final product was obtained by freeze-drying the well-dispersed
solution, followed by annealing in 5% H2/Ar gas at 300
°C for 5 h.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements
were conducted on a Bruker, D8-Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu
radiation (Cu Kα = 0.15406 nm). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
was performed by using TA instrument 2960 at a heating rate of 10
°C/min from room temperature to 900 °C under air flow. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area was measured by nitrogen sorption at 77 K on a
surface area and pore size analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments NOVA
2200e). The pore size distribution was obtained by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2010) and field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, JEOL JSM 6700F) were employed for material characterization.
All of the electrodes after discharge and charge were disassembled,
rinsed with acetonitrile, and naturally dried in Ar-filled glovebox
before further characterization. For the characterization of the O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery electrodes, XPS
system was specially configured with the XPS preparation chamber directly
connected to a glovebox, which can significantly reduce the air contamination.
The peak positions were corrected by referencing the C 1s peak position
of carbon (284.6 eV). Raman data were collected with a 532 nm excitation
laser, and the equipment was specially configured so that electrodes
can be kept in Ar protective atmosphere during the entire measurement.

Battery Assembly and Testing
The cathode was prepared
by mixing 90% active material (Ru/GNSs or GNSs) with 10% poly(vinylidene
difluoride) (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone dispersant.
The obtained slurry was then coated onto Toray Carbon Paper (TGP-H-060)
and dried at 100 °C overnight before use. A typical mass loading
of the cathode catalyst was 0.4–0.5 mg/cm2 and the
specific capacity was calculated based on the total mass of the cathode
catalyst. The Li–CO2, O2-assisted Li–CO2, and Li–O2 batteries were assembled based
on a coin-cell structure in an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O
< 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.4 ppm). The lithium foil and 0.1
M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) in DMSO were used as anode
and electrolyte, respectively. The obtained coin cells were transferred
to home-made pressure-tight glass containers and refilled with purified
CO2, CO2 with 2% O2, or O2 for 20 min before test. The battery galvanostatic discharge/charge
test was carried out on the LAND multichannel battery testing system
at room temperature.

DEMS Measurements of the Aprotic O2-Assisted Li–CO2 Cells
A quantitative
DEMS was used to study the
noble metal–catalyzed O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery cells. A home-made O2-assisted Li–CO2 battery cell with two glued PEEK capillary tubes as purge
gas inlet and outlet (Swagelok type) was linked to a commercial magnetic
sector mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) by a specially designed gas-purging
system. The flow rate of purge gas was 5 mL/min. During the discharge
process, a mixture of Ar/O2/CO2 (volume ratio
4.99:47.70:47.61) was used as the carrier gas for the purpose of quantifying
CO2 and O2 consumption. Ar acted as the internal
tracer gas with known constant flux. For charging the O2-assisted Li–CO2 cells, high-purity Ar was used
as carrier gas. All of the cells were tested at the current of 0.4
mA with restrained capacity of 50 mA h/g for discharge and recharge.
