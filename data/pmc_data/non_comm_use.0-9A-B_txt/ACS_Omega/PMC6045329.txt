The
persistent photoconductivity (PPC) of the n-type Ga-polar GaN
was used to stimulate PC12 cells noninvasively. Analysis of the III–V
semiconductor material by atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force
microscopy, photoconductivity, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
quantified bulk and surface charge, as well as chemical composition
before and after exposure to UV light and cell culture media. The
semiconductor surface was made photoconductive by illumination with
UV light and experienced PPC, which was utilized to stimulate PC12
cells in vitro. Stimulation was confirmed by measuring the changes
in intracellular calcium concentration. Control experiments with gallium
salt verified the stimulation of neurotypic cells. Inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry data confirmed the lack of gallium leaching
and toxic effects during the stimulation.

1 Introduction
Electrical
stimulation of cells is of interest to understand the
fundamental role of bioelectrical signals with respect to cell, tissue,
and organ function.1 In particular, mapping
how electrical stimulation affects the neural cells has garnered additional
interests because of the possibility to develop devices with clinical
relevance.2 As a result of all of this
work, researchers have shown that electrical stimulation can enhance
as well as guide the directionality of neurites. The published in
vitro studies have utilized a number of materials’ approaches
to facilitate electrical stimulation.3 Both
two-dimensional and three-dimensional scaffolds composed of both organic
and inorganic materials have been studied.4 A variety of fabrication strategies have been published including
electrospinning, surface functionalization, and nanoparticle–polymeric
composites.5 Biomaterials’ interfaces
in conjunction with electrical stimulation have induced the following
cellular responses: morphology, migration, differentiation, proliferation,
and adhesion. However, the application of electrical stimulation during
in vitro studies varies widely, and many methodologies have been described
as powerful but invasive, and with the disadvantage of being coupled
with specialized equipment.

The need for a noninvasive stimulation
has resulted in a number
of seminal studies associated with interfaces for light-dependent
cell stimulation. Pulsed IR light from a laser has been employed in
vivo,6 but is often times cited as potentially
damaging to tissues due to high local thermal changes. The field of
optogenetics,7 where one uses light-sensitive
proteins to trigger a response, relies on the light-emitting diodes
and is still invasive due to the way light is delivered. The drive
to reduce the invasive nature of the light stimulation has led to
the development of photoactive and photoconductive surfaces. Many
researchers have focused on adapting conductive polymers or quantum
dots for this purpose.8−10 These entities are attractive because one can fabricate
thin films with them using flexible and low-cost fabrication strategies
such as the layer-by-layer approach. Photoconductive silicon has been
utilized in an inverted microscope setup where the invasive nature
of the excitation is reduced but the need for laser light during excitation
still remains.11 Adapting materials with
persistent photoconductivity (PPC) can eliminate the need for a light
source during the stimulation.

In this article, we report on
the ability of gallium nitride (GaN)
to stimulate neurotypic PC12 cells due to its PPC properties, Scheme 1. This report builds
on our recent efforts where we showed that PPC, variable topography,
and surface bound functional groups can guide PC12 cells on specific
surface locations.12 We now describe the
interfacial changes, along with surface and bulk charge properties
that contribute to our ability to use the PPC of GaN to noninvasively
stimulate the PC12 cells in vitro. We demonstrate that the stimulation
of the PC12 cells is possible from a direct control of the surface
charges. We report on the semiconductor characterization in the context
of the in vitro studies using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
atomic force microscopy (AFM), Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM),
and photovoltage measurements. We monitor the photoconductive stimulation
via changes in intracellular calcium concentration that are governed
by voltage-dependent channels.

Cells in Vitro
2 Results
and Discussion
Before the in vitro studies, two types of
Ga-polar samples have
been characterized. We evaluate both p- and n-type material to determine
their suitability for stimulation experiments. The carrier concentrations
are 4 × 1016 and 1017 cm–3 for the n- and p-type, respectively. We measure the photocurrent
as a function of time before and after exposure to UV light. The relative
intensity of photocurrent is significantly higher for the n-type sample
compared to the dark photocurrent, Figure 1A. In addition to the magnitude of the photocurrent,
we record different lifetime characteristics of the PPC for the n-
and p-type samples. The time needed to drop to 10% of the dark photocurrent
for the n-type sample is 100 s. The small amount of photocurrent generated
by the p-type sample decays very slowly. The PPC for the p-type sample
can be detected hours after illumination. Earlier work has extensively
investigated the role of types and amounts of extrinsic dopants with
respect to PPC in III–V semiconductor materials.13 A combination of spectroscopy techniques has
shown that extrinsic dopants are not responsible for the PPC characteristics
of the materials. The PPC is thought to be determined by large lifetimes
induced by point defects such as DX centers or the charge-separating
polarization fields in the samples.14 The
data in Figure 1A determine
the bulk conductivity of the material before and after UV light illumination.
Literature reports have suggested that the nanostructured thin film
materials have a significant number of charge carriers near the surface
and are responsible for the specific PPC behavior.15 Both N-polar and Ga-polar GaN thin films have a distinct
nanostructured morphology recorded by a number of researchers in earlier
work.16 To understand the role of surface
charge in the observed PPC characteristics, Kelvin probe force microscopy
(KPFM) is performed on both types of materials.

the p-type and n-type Ga-polar GaN before
(zone 1), during (zone 2), and after (zone 3), exposure to UV light.
(B) Changes in surface potential collected by KPFM of p- and n-type
Ga-polar GaN before and during exposure to UV light. (C) Changes in
surface potential as a function of time, and before and after illumination
with UV light. (D) Time dependence of the recorded photocurrent and
surface potential voltage (SPV) for the p-type Ga-polar GaN. The change
in the SPV for the p-type Ga-polar GaN is obvious, but it is not so
for the n-type Ga-polar GaN due to the time scale.

Figure 1B summarizes
the KPFM results for both p- and n-type Ga-polar GaN samples before
and after UV illumination. When the KPFM is performed, one sets up
the experiment to record any difference in the potential between the
probe and the sample.17,18 Any time one applies an alternating
current voltage to the cantilever, it will cause it to experience
electrostatic force and vibrate. For this reason, during the experiment,
a direct current (DC) voltage is applied to eliminate tip vibrations.19 The amount of applied DC voltage corresponds
to the surface potential. In all of the cases when KPFM is done, a
topography image is acquired simultaneously with the surface potential
map. The two types of samples we studied have distinct differences
in roughness. The rms values are 1.01 ± 1.01 and 13.7 ±
16.2 nm for the n- and p-type, respectively. Taken in sum, the KPFM
data indicate that the magnitude of the surface potential is lower
before exposure to light for both samples. The surface potential is
positive for n-type and negative for p-type, as expected for the surface
work function. The increase in the magnitude of the surface potential
under illumination is a consequence of the induced surface photovoltage
accompanied by an accumulation of minority carriers (i.e., increased
positive charge and negative charge for n-type and p-type materials,
respectively) at the surface, Figure 1C. The decay in the conductivity and associated surface
potential indicates an associated gradual decrease in the near-surface
accumulated charge, Figure 1D. Furthermore, the n-type sample demonstrates a larger change
in conductivity and surface potential under illumination in comparison
to the p-type GaN. Consequently, the n-type Ga-polar GaN with a large
accumulation of charge at the surface is a more suitable material
for cell stimulation studies.

Further spectroscopic characterization
is performed on the n-type
Ga-polar GaN samples to understand changes in the surface composition
during solution exposure. More specifically, we carried out X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization with the intent
of quantifying oxide formation20 in air
and in solution before and after UV exposure. The solution used in
these studies is Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), which is suitable for the growth of PC12 cells. All of the
UV exposure is done outside of the solution for the same period of
time. The surface compositions and all types samples’ conditions
are summarized in the Supporting Information. In the absence of subsequent solution treatment, UV light does
not result in a significant change in oxygen concentration on the
surface. However, exposure to UV light in air leads to a lower amount
of carbon present on the surface. We observed a statistically significant
increase in the oxygen content on the surface after UV exposure and
soaking in DMEM media. The amount of sodium detected under these conditions
also increases proportionally, Figure 2A,B. These results support the notion that electrostatic
interactions facilitate the adsorption of ions from the solution onto
the surface. Our data are in agreement with a recent report that charge
on the surface governs the assembly of charged diamond particles from
solution onto both Ga-polar and N-polar GaN.21 We quantified the change in surface roughness after incubation in
DMEM solution before and after exposure to UV light. The amounts of
adsorbates from the media present on the surface are substantial after
soaking for 24 h leading to a statistically significant change in
roughness. We observe a larger change when the samples are exposed
to UV light before soaking in the DMEM solution. The observed change
in protein adsorption from cell media upon exposure to UV light is
consistent with earlier reports with photoresponsive GaN nanowires.22 The roughness data are in agreement with the
XPS observations and support the conclusion that an increase in oxides
and oxyhydroxides on the surface can result in more adsorption onto
the semiconductor interface.

conditions extracted

surface under different conditions extracted from the high-resolution
Na 1s XPS data. (C) Changes in surface roughness of n-type Ga-polar
GaN under different conditions. All of the rms values were extracted
from the AFM images collected by AFM in air.

After the material characterization, we perform in vitro
assays
with the PC12 cells to test the hypothesis that n-type Ga-polar GaN
can be used to stimulate neurotypic cells noninvasively. We validate
the stimulation of the PC12 cells using an established assay to measure
changes in the intracellular calcium concentration.23 The exact mechanism and details of each step of stimulation
of neuronal and neurotypic cells are still under investigation. However,
an overwhelming amount of data in the literature have established
that an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration is one
of the steps of electrical stimulation of neurotypic cells.24 In all of our experiments, the cells are never
exposed to UV light. The n-type Ga-polar GaN is exposed to UV light
before any introduction into the cell culture dishes. Based on the
protocols developed by others, the PC12 cells are loaded with Fluo-4,
a well-studied calcium indicator dye.25 The data shown in Figure 3A indicate that the samples that experience PPC can indeed
trigger an increase in intracellular calcium. The same amounts of
cells and same types of semiconductor samples that are not exposed
to UV light show an absence of elevated intracellular calcium concentration.
The data in Figure 3A also include control experiments with no cells and no semiconductor
samples that solidify the above conclusion.

Calcium response of PC12 cells in the presence or absence of different
concentrations of Ga(NO3)3 salt.

An increase in intracellular calcium can also be
due to a cytotoxic
response as has been established with the nanostructured materials
such as silver.26 In our earlier article,
we report that UV light exposure of GaN samples causes only a small
increase in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.12 The ROS production can be triggered by the dissolved
metal ions in solution. GaN is often quoted as an extremely stable
material in harsh conditions27 and a very
promising interface for many biosensing applications.28 Despite the fact that our samples are in solution for only
a few minutes to perform the calcium assay, we verify the amount of
gallium leached in a solution from the samples during the assay and
after one day of incubation in the solution (see the Supporting Information for all of the data and statistical
analysis). The data collected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) indicate that at the time the calcium assay is performed
in the cell culture wells with and without GaN samples, the amount
of gallium is around 250 ppt, and there is no statistically significant
difference in the results for all of the samples. After one day of
incubation in a solution, the amount of gallium leached increases
in the cell culture wells with GaN, but remains bellow 750 ppt. These
results are in agreement with a number of ICP-MS analysis we have
published on GaN with different polarities and compositions.29−31 The ICP-MS data we collected for the present work confirms that
leaching of gallium ions during the initial stimulation of the cells
does not occur and will therefore not obscure the interpretation of
results.

Additional experiments are performed to quantify the
effect of
gallium ions on the changes in intracellular calcium concentration, Figure 3B. A water-soluble
Ga(NO3)3 is used for these experiments. Statistical
comparisons among the data collected with three different gallium
salt concentrations introduced in the PC12 cell culture show that
an increase in gallium ion concentration leads to a decrease in the
amount of intracellular calcium concentration. Control experiments
are performed in the absence of gallium salt and the absence of PC12
cells. Earlier work with PC12 cells has concluded that a decrease
in intracellular calcium concentration is a respiratory response and
can be triggered by an excess of ions in the extracellular solution.32 The ICP-MS and the additional assay data with
the gallium salt support the conclusion that the calcium responses
we observe with the semiconductor samples that experience PPC are
due to stimulation of the PC12 rather than a response to the degradation
of the semiconductor material.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we demonstrate that PPC of the n-type Ga-polar GaN
can be used to noninvasively stimulate neurotypic PC12 cells. The
type of semiconductor material chosen determines the amount of surface
charge used for cell stimulation. The method to “charge”
the semiconductor surface requires no special setup and only an affordable
UV lamp. The surface characterization detailed the role of surface
charge in the amount and persistency of the observed photoconductivity.
The recorded change in intracellular calcium concentration in the
presence of GaN with PPC demonstrates that one can noninvasively stimulate
PC12 cells in vitro. The reported results are significant, as they
open the possibility to utilize the electronic properties of III–V
semiconductors to electrically stimulate cells without the use of
electrodes or externally applied current. In future work, one can
vary the electronic properties of the semiconductor substrate to a
achieve dose-dependent stimulation.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Semiconductor Growth
The n-type and
p-type Ga-polar GaN were grown on sapphire wafers by metalorganic
chemical vapor deposition using typical precursors: triethylgallium,
ammonia, silane (n-type), and cyclopentadienyl magnesium (p-type).
The film thickness was around 1 μm. Details on the growth procedures
are described elsewhere.

4.2 Photocurrent Measurements
A Keithley
4200SCS characterization system was used to measure and record the
photocurrent from n-type and p-type GaN semiconductor samples. The
samples were left in the dark for 24 h before taking the measurement
and UV illumination was done using a 4 W UVP, Longwave UV Lamp (Analytik
Jena) with a 365 nm wavelength. UV illumination on the samples was
∼75 s.

4.3 AFM and KPFM
A
minimum of three random
5 × 5 μm2 scans containing height, phase, and
topography information was obtained using an Asylum Cypher S AFM.
These scans were conducted on GaN wafers in various conditions using
tapping mode with a scan frequency of 1 Hz and rectangular tipped
cantilevers obtained from Asylum Research (f = 75
kHz, k = 3 N/m). We repeated the experiment three
times for each condition. The the root mean square roughness
values were calculated through Igor Pro (version 13.01.68), was measured
in three random locations on each replicate.

Kelvin probe force
microscopy was used to measure the topography, phase, amplitude, and
surface potential of a minimum of three random 5 × 5 μm2 scans conducted on each of the condition’s three replicates.
Conductive probes coated with Ti/Ir obtained from Asylum Research
(f = 285 kHz, k = 42 N/m) were used
for electrical measurements. The high conductivity of the samples
caused significant (∼2–3 V) drift when left ungrounded.
Thus, to prevent this drift, metallized contacts were deposited on
the surface of the semiconductor samples, and a flexible wire was
placed connecting the sample to a ground lead on the AFM. This sample
grounding decreased the standard deviations from ∼2–3
V to ∼200 mV. The average surface potentials of each scan were
statistically analyzed.

Surface charge was monitored with KPFM
before, during, and after
exposure to UV light. This was done by measuring the surface potential
of a 5 × 5 nm2 area with a scan time of 1 min 5 s.
UV illumination was conducted by placing the UV lamp in the AFM before
scanning, and turning it on (UV+) and off (UV−) to minimize
surface potential drift within each scan. The average surface potential
of each area was plotted against time, and the standard deviation
of each area was used as error bars.

4.4 XPS
A Kratos Axis Ultra DLD X-ray
photoelectron spectrometer was used to analyze the surface chemistry
of GaN surfaces under a variety of conditions. The experimental design
was a fully factorial design measuring the change in surface chemistry
from the effect of soaking in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(ThermoFisher) for 24 h and UV illumination for 1 h, before the DMEM
soaking. Three areas of each replicate surface were individually scanned,
and the results were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). In addition to a survey scan (pass energy = 160 eV), high-resolution
regional scans (pass energy = 20 eV) were also performed for Ga 2p,
Ga 3d, N 1s, C 1s, O 1s, and Na 1s. Atomic concentrations were calculated
from the survey scans using Casa XPS (version 2.3.12.8), and the averages
from each replicate condition were analyzed after conducting a Shirley
background subtraction and C 1s calibration to 284.8 eV.

4.5 GaN Wafers—Calcium Assay
Fourth
passage PC12 cells (ATCC) were grown to 80% confluency in collagen-coated
petri dishes. A 0.5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA was added to the cultures for
cellular detachment, and the cultures were then incubated at 37°
at a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Sterilized PC12 cell media consisting
of DMEM containing 12.5% horse serum, 2.5% bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
was prepared and used throughout all of the cell growth and studies.
The cell suspensions were then centrifuged at 200 g for 8 min, and
the medium was aspirated and replaced with 12 mL of the Fluo-4 Direct
calcium assay reagent-calcium assay buffer (F10472, Invitrogen). The
included probenecid was not added to decrease the potential cytotoxic
effects. The cell suspension was then vortexed to break up the cell
pellet. Meanwhile, a collagen-coated 24-well plate was prepared with
the semiconductor samples. Two test conditions and three control conditions
were used: (1) semiconductor samples were exposed to UV light for
1 h before cell seeding; (2) semiconductors were left unexposed with
UV light; (3) no semiconductor was placed in the well; (4) neither
samples nor cells were placed in the wells; and (5) semiconductors
that were not exposed to UV were placed in the well with no dye present.
Each condition was replicated in three wells.

For each replicate,
0.5 mL of the the Fluo-4 Direct calcium assay reagent/Ca assay buffer
suspension was deposited in each well with a cellular concentration
of ∼210 000 cells/well. Warmed cell medium (0.5 mL)
was also deposited into each well for a 1.0 mL total volume that contains
a 50/50 mix of a cell suspension of dye (Fluo-4 Direct calcium assay
buffer and reagent) and cell media. The well plate was then incubated
at 37° in 5% CO2 for 1 h. After incubation, the well
plate was inserted in a Tecan Microplate reader with excitation at
494 nm and emission at 516 nm. The fluorescence signal for each well
was measured three times, sequentially. The data were analyzed in
terms of relative fluorescence units (RFUs), whereby the , where all
of the conditions were compared
against the control condition where no semiconductor was present with
the cells. Soon after the fluorescence measurements were conducted,
a 200 μL aliquot was obtained from each well (replicate). The
well plate was incubated for 24 h, and an additional 200 μL
aliquot was taken from each well. These aliquots were stored at ∼2
°C until they were analyzed by ICP-MS.

4.6 Ga Salt—Calcium
Assay
Ga(III)
nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich was diluted into sterilized
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at concentrations of 4, 2, and 1 μg/L.
In addition to the salt conditions, three controls were prepared:
0 μg/L salt with PBS, 0 μg/L salt in PBS with no cells
present, and 0 μg/L salt in prepared cell media. In total, 0.5
mL of each of the salt/PBS or salt/media conditions was deposited
into a prepared collagen-coated 24-well plate. Each condition was
replicated in three different wells. Meanwhile, 7th passage PC12 cells
were harvested by introducing 0.25% Trypsin-2.21 mM EDTA into cell
culture dishes. After centrifugation and media aspiration, the cells
were resuspended in a volume containing Fluo-4 Direct calcium assay
reagent combined with 100 mL of the Fluo-4 Direct calcium assay buffer.
Dye-cell suspension (0.5 mL) was then passaged into wells of the 24-well
plate at a cell density of 230 000 cells/well and then incubated
at 37° in 5% CO2 in the dark for 1 h. Thus, the salt
concentrations were diluted by 2× to the final concentrations
of 2, 1, and 0.5 μg/L. After incubation, the well plate was
transferred to a microplate reader, tested using the Fluo-4 Direct
calcium assay methods previously described.

4.7 ICP-MS
All data was collected with
a Thermo Element XR instrument. 200 μL aliquots were
taken from each replicate at day 0 and at day 1 from the same wells
that the Ca-assay on GaN wafers was conducted. These aliquots were
prepared for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
by filtering and acid digestion in water. The Ga concentrations were
measured for each replicate and analyzed using statistical analyses.

4.8 Statistical analysis
All of the statistical
analyses were conducted using OriginPro 2016 (b9.3.1.273). One-way
and two-way ANOVAs were used to find differences between the experimental
conditions with a significance level of 0.05.
