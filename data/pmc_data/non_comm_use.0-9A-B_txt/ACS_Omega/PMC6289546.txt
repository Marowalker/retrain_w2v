Glycosylation significantly alters
the biological and physicochemical properties of small molecules.
β-Lactam alcohols comprise eligible substrates for such a transformation
based on their distinct relevance in the chemical and medicinal community.
In this framework, the unprecedented enzymatic glycosylation of the
rigid and highly strained four-membered β-lactam azaheterocycle
was studied. For this purpose, cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams
were efficiently prepared in three steps by means of a classical organic
synthesis approach, while a biocatalytic step was implemented for
the selective formation of the corresponding 3-O-α-
and -β-glucosides, hence overcoming the complexities typically
encountered in synthetic glycochemistry and contributing to the increasing
demand for sustainable processes in the framework of green chemistry.
Two carbohydrate-active enzymes were selected based on their broad
acceptor specificity and subsequently applied for the α- or
β-selective formation of β-lactam-sugar adducts, using
sucrose as a glucosyl donor.

Introduction
The very first β-lactam
synthesis by Staudinger back in 1907,1 followed
by the accidental discovery of the antibacterial properties of penicillin 1 (penicillin G, R = Bn) by Fleming 20 years later,2 marked the beginning of a revolution in the science
of medicine (Figure 1). Up to now, penicillins and more recently discovered classes of
β-lactam antibiotics are considered to be the major means of
defense against pathogenic bacteria and represent the world’s
major biotechnology products.3 Over the
years, besides their antibacterial properties, other pharmacological
features of β-lactams were also unveiled (e.g., cholesterol
absorption inhibition,4 inhibition of human
tryptase,5 thrombin6 and chymase,7 vasopressin V1a antagonist
activity,8 antiviral,9 antitumor,10 antidiabetic,11 anti-inflammatory,12 antiparkinsonian13 and antitubercular
activity,14 etc.), which, in combination
with their considerable synthetic importance as four-membered, highly
strained cyclic amides,15,72 promoted β-lactams
to become one of the most studied classes of azaheterocycles to date.

Figure 1 Bioactive
(β-lactam-containing) compounds.

In general, monocyclic β-lactams unfairly comprise
an underexplored subclass, though they are particularly interesting
with respect to the treatment of bacterial infections (e.g., commercial
3-aminomonobactam aztreonam 2, Figure 1).16 3-Hydroxy-β-lactams 3, such as glutamine synthetase-inhibiting tabtoxinine β-lactam 4, can also possess antimicrobial activity,17,18 whereas others have been proven to exhibit significant antitumor
effects. For example, several 1,4-diarylazetidin-2-ones (such as compound 5), which are conformationally restricted analogues of (Z)-combretastatin A-4 6, a natural product
that inhibits tubulin polymerization, showed strong potencies against
human neuroblastoma cell growth.10 Furthermore,
the renowned “β-lactam synthon method” has been
applied repeatedly to convert versatile 3-hydroxy-β-lactam precursors
into a variety of highly functionalized scaffolds of biological and
medicinal interest,15 such as the side
chain of the anticancer drug taxol,19 antibiotics,20 alkaloids,21 amino
acids, peptides,22 etc.

In the framework
of the biological and synthetic relevance of the class of 3-hydroxy-β-lactams
(3, Figure 1), we proposed to subject them to a glucosylation reaction, i.e.
glycosylation with glucose.23 Glycosylation
can be defined as the attachment of a carbohydrate onto a chemical
scaffold, known as the aglycone, via an O-, N-, S-, or C-atom. Hence,
in this study, the β-lactam 3-hydroxy-entity serves as the anchor
point. Glycosylation is a very common phenomenon in nature and probably
concerns one of the most frequent and important modifications of biomolecules.24 It is, for instance, believed to play a key
role in cellular communication in plants through accumulation, storage,
and transport of hydrophobic substances.25 Moreover, glycosylation has numerous practical applications in synthesis,
where it might act as a chiral source or lead to bioactive precursors,26−28 or in industry, where it can be applied to detergents and cosmetics
(e.g., long alkyl chain aglycones),29,30 antifungal
and antimicrobial compounds (e.g., unsaturated alkyl chain aglycones),31 antitumor formulations and cardiac-related drugs
(e.g., peptide and steroid aglycones)31,32 and “controlled
release” compounds (e.g., flavor and fragrance aglycones).33

This endless series of examples arises
from the influence glycosylation can exert on various physicochemical
and biological properties. The most obvious advantage concerns the
solubility and bioavailability increase of hydrophobic aglycones,
augmenting their potential in pharmacological applications,23 as is for example the case for glycopeptides
and curcumin (20 million-fold better aqueous solubility of the latter).34,35 Besides the effect on solubility, glycosylation can be used to alter
the bioactivity of the compound. Although so far not a widespread
mechanism of antibiotic resistance, glycosylation does play a role
in self-protection of antibiotic-producing organisms,36 while bringing about a spectacular increase in activity,
as is well illustrated by vancomycin, a glycopeptide effective against
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. By means of glycorandomization, which is a way to acquire a library
of analogues by changing the carbohydrate moiety, several derivatives
have been found to be up to 500 times more effective than vancomycin
itself.37 Related to this, and even more
triggering for the purpose of this study, is the finding that phenolic O-glycosylated ezetimibe, a β-lactam with cholesterol
absorption inhibitory activity, was found to be 4 times as potent
as its corresponding aglycone 7 (Figure 2).38 Moreover,
glycosylation enables tuning of the oxidative and thermal stability,
as is the case for vitamin C,39 or the
toxicity of the aglycone, illustrated by a reduced cardiotoxicity
of anthracycline antibiotics.40

Figure 2 Ezetimibe 7.

Undoubtedly, glycosides are of
high commercial interest,25 though their
synthesis is still far from trivial. Chemical glycosylation reactions
using these complex substrates typically suffer from the lack of regioselectivity
(primary, secondary, and hemiacetalic hydroxyl groups) and stereoselectivity
with respect to the anomeric carbon center. Protection and deprotection
steps have to be taken into account, involving additional synthetic
manipulations, reagents, catalysts, solvents and hence toxic chemical
waste streams, besides low overall yields. The development of economically
and ecologically feasible procedures in the field of glycochemistry
thus remains challenging.23,24,41 Biocatalytic routes have therefore received increasing attention
as efficient and green alternatives, by circumventing the disadvantages
associated with chemical glycosylation protocols.42,43 Enzymes are capable of regio-, stereo-, and enantioselectively glycosylating
various acceptors under mild conditions using renewable starting materials,
rendering additional synthetic steps and the concomitant requirements
redundant. However, despite considerable efforts to improve enzymatic
glycosylation reactions, no universal enzymatic glycosylation platform
exists to date. Furthermore, the methodology still suffers from the
lack of long-term enzymatic stability, acceptor solubility issues
in the aqueous systems used and mostly expensive donors, hence hampering
its broad use.23,44,45

Yet, convinced by the assets of biocatalysis and its implementation
in organic synthesis, as was also demonstrated by our preliminary
studies on the chemoenzymatic syntheses of biologically relevant azaheterocyclic
compounds,46,47 the enzymatic glucosylation of
chemically prepared cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams 8, without affecting the sensitive four-membered ring system,
is envisioned in the current work. In fact, enzymatic glycosylation
of 3-hydroxy-β-lactams as challenging substrates based on their
rigidity and steric bulk, has never been described before. As the
configuration of the anomeric center is known to alter the biological
properties of the molecule,48,49 the selective formation
of both α- and β-glucosides 9 are contemplated,
as presented in Scheme 1.

rebaudiana, Respectively
Results and Discussion
In a first phase, the selective
synthesis of the starting cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams 8 was performed based on preceding research performed by our
group, by means of three consecutive steps.50 Though reported more than 100 years ago, the Staudinger synthesis
remains the most general and most frequently applied methodology for
the preparation of β-lactams and derived compounds based on
its simplicity in reaction procedures and predictability of the stereochemical
outcome. The mechanism concerns a [2 + 2]-cyclocondensation between
functionalized aldimines, obtained through imination of the corresponding
aldehydes, and in situ generated ketenes.1 To that end, primary amines 11 were condensed with
aldehydes 10 in the presence of magnesium sulfate under
various conditions, depending on the nature of the substrates (Scheme 2 and Table 1). The (E)-N-(alkyl/arylmethylidene)amines 12, thus obtained
were reacted with acetoxyacetyl chloride 13, transformed
in situ to the corresponding ketene through treatment with triethylamine,
affording 3-acetoxyazetidin-2-ones 14. The appropriate
alkylic/arylic starting materials were selected (R1 = iPr, Pr, Ph; R2 = Bn, iPr), thus offering a variety of β-lactams with
respect to steric bulk and polarity. Almost complete diastereoselectivity
toward the cis-β-lactams 14 was
observed, as deduced from the 1H NMR spectra (CDCl3). The vicinal coupling constants JH3–H4 between the C3- and C4-protons of the azetidin-2-one ring systems
varied between 4.6 and 5.0 Hz, values typical for cis-isomers,51 while for derivative 14a, a minor amount (9%) of trans-β-lactam
was formed as well (JH3–H4 = 1.7
Hz, CDCl3). Pure cis-β-lactams 14 were obtained after column chromatography-mediated isolation
on silica gel (except for alkyl-derivative 14b, posing
difficulties during purification and hence further used in a crude
form) and subjected to alkaline conditions in a mixture of methanol
and water (1:1–2:1) for deacetylation of the C3-group, thus
releasing the premised free alcohols 8 for subsequent
glycosylation without affecting the relative cis-stereochemistry.

In the past century, organic chemists have developed
various methods to glycosylate different acceptors, including hydroxylated
β-lactams. Banik and co-workers led this research field when
it comes to 3-O-glycosylazetidin-2-ones, more specifically
the stereospecific glycosylation with glycals, cyclic enol ether derivatives
of sugars. They reported an iodine-catalyzed α-glycosylation
reaction of racemic 3-hydroxy-β-lactams with various 3-acetoxyglycals
via the Ferrier rearrangement, providing access to an optically pure
intermediate ((3R,4S)-3-acetoxy-1-(p-anisyl)-4-phenylazetidin-2-one) for the preparation of
the Taxol and Taxotere side chain by means of the optical resolution
principle.52 Toward the same objective,
some research groups employed the Staudinger synthesis starting from
protected glycosylated precursors of ketenes, equally affording 3-O-β-lactam-sugar adducts containing several chiral
centers, which served as a source of chirality in asymmetric synthesis.53−55

A variety of other chemical procedures are available enabling
coupling of a sugar entity with a β-lactam at the C3-, C4-,
or even the N1-position (or further away from the β-lactam nucleus)
through carbon–carbon or carbon–heteroatom bond formation.56 However, as mentioned before, these reactions
typically suffer from low yields, low atom efficiencies, and excessive
burden on the environment, making them barely viable from an economic
and ecological point of view. Nonetheless, to be able to compare a
chemical and enzymatic approach for the glucosylation of our specific
substrates, the classical Koenigs–Knorr glycosylation was tested
in this study for the attempted synthesis of 3-O-β-glucosyl-β-lactams 9.57 The mechanism comprises nucleophilic
substitution of a glycosyl halide by an alcohol and still constitutes
a preferred synthetic method in glycochemistry. Unfortunately, we
encountered various obstacles when testing several glucosyl donors,
acceptors, and reaction conditions, giving rise only to a minor amount
of the expected glycoside and hence confirming the general conclusions
reported in the literature with respect to chemical glycosylations.

On the other hand, many of the drawbacks of chemical glycosylation
may be overcome by using biocatalysts. Nakayama and co-workers developed
the first detailed synthesis of vancomycin and some derivatives through
two enzymatic glycosylation steps,44 while
the enzymatic glucuronidation of ezetimibe 7 has been
reported by Zaks and Dodds, in up to 92 and 88% isolated yield, respectively.58 Although the synthesis of the donor substrates
is somewhat demanding, careful comparison with their chemical syntheses,
requiring tedious protection–deprotection steps of the glycosyl
donors resulting in low overall yields, pointed to the enzymatic
approach to be the most efficient one.38,59,60

Four types of enzymes that are capable of catalyzing
a glycosyl transfer can be distinguished (Scheme 3).61 The vast
majority of glycosylation reactions in nature is performed by glycosyltransferases.
Although these biocatalysts are highly efficient and provide excellent
regio- and stereocontrol, their practical use is hampered due to the
excessive cost of the nucleotide-activated carbohydrate donors they
require. Transglycosidases are an attractive alternative in this regard,
using cheap substrates such as sucrose and amylose, but the variety
of different transglycosidase specificities that have been reported
to date is rather limited. Finally, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases
both perform a catabolic role in vivo, cleaving glycosidic bonds using
water or phosphate, respectively, but they can be exploited for synthetic
purposes under specific process conditions as well.

Scheme 3 Carbohydrate-Active
Enzymes Used in Glycosylation Reactions (A = Acceptor; Pi = Inorganic Phosphate; UDP = Uridine Diphosphate)23
A critical property
to consider when choosing a suitable candidate for catalyzing the
envisioned glycosylation reactions is the substrate promiscuity. Indeed,
acceptor sites that are strictly specific toward a narrow group of
molecules will be less likely to bind the rather challenging cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactam targets. Therefore, two biocatalysts
that are known to have a broad acceptor scope were selected. The sucrose
6′-phosphate phosphorylase from T. thermosaccharolyticum (TtSPP) is an appealing enzyme for the synthesis
of α-glucosides considering the use of sucrose as a cheap and
renewable donor substrate, and shows activity on a diverse range of
small molecules with retention of the anomeric configuration.62 Moreover, a mutant of TtSPP
(R134A) was rationally designed previously in our laboratory to widen
the entrance to the active site, triggering affinity for bulky polyphenols
such as resveratrol.63 The selected option
for the synthesis of β-bonded adducts concerns the stevioside
glucosyltransferase from S. rebaudiana (UGT-76G1Sr), which has been employed successfully
on structures such as branched alcohols, flavonoids, terpenoids, and
more.64 Although its need for the expensive
donor substrate uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) is a major
drawback, this problem is circumvented in this work by coupling the
reaction to a sucrose synthase (SuSy).65 Hence, UDP-glucose is regenerated from sucrose in situ while conveniently
recycling the UDP byproduct of the transferase reaction (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Enzymatic Glucosylation
of 3-Hydroxy-β-lactams 8 (TtSPP_R134A,
Mutant R134A of the Sucrose 6′-Phosphate Phosphorylase from T. thermosaccharolyticum; UGT-76G1Sr, UDP-Glucosyltransferase from S. rebaudiana; SuSy, Sucrose Synthase from Acidithiobacillus caldus)
The solubility of the β-lactam
acceptors 8 is quite poor in the aqueous solutions that
these enzymes prefer. Therefore, the performance of various cosolvents
(10% v/v) was assessed in small-scale glucosylation reactions. 2-Methylbutan-2-ol
and acetonitrile appeared to be toxic to the enzymes, while 2-phenylethanol
and isobutanol were unsuitable as they were found to act as acceptor
substrates as well, resulting in side products. The desired glucoside
was present in highest quantity when diethyl ether, acetone, methanol,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or methyl t-butyl ether
were added. Acetone was finally selected as the most appropriate cosolvent
due to its low toxicity, high volatility, and the absence of potentially
competing hydroxyl groups. Additionally, the optimal acceptor concentration
was determined for both the α- and β-glucosylation reactions.
The highest conversions were observed at a concentration of 15 mM
in all cases, except for the reaction of 8a with TtSPP_R134A (21 mM).

The α- and β-glucosylation
of all three β-lactam acceptors were carried out at a preparative
scale (0.375–2.1 mmol acceptor 8) under these
optimized conditions, at several degrees below the enzymes’
optimal temperature to slow down irreversible denaturation. All glucosides
were successfully synthesized, although the reactions proceeded very
slowly and took several days to reach a practical degree of conversion
(Table 2). As a comparison,
almost complete conversion of resveratrol could be achieved within
24 h with these enzymes.62,63 This difference may
be explained by the rigid and bulky structure of the current compounds,
which could cause steric clashes in the active site. Finally, after
inactivation and removal of the enzymes, the target compounds 9 could be recovered and purified by means of (a sequence
of) chromatographic techniques, which resulted in rather low yields.
However, it should be noted that the main focus of this research was
to obtain and isolate the glucosides in an analytically pure form
to allow their spectroscopic analysis, hence the elaborate purification
procedures to remove all impurities.

The successful synthesis of cis-3-O-d-glucopyranosyl-3-hydroxyazetidin-2-ones 9-αG and 9-βG was confirmed on the
basis of the characteristic spectral data and their accordance with
reported literature values (Scheme 4, Tables 2 and 3).66 The
typical anomeric proton signals are located as a doublet around δ
4.97–5.21 and 4.10–4.70 ppm for the α- and β-glucosides,
respectively, and can easily be distinguished from the nearby doublet
signals of the protons located on the β-lactam ring (J = ±5 Hz) (1H NMR, D2O). A clear
difference is to be noticed between the respective values of the vicinal
coupling constants JH1–H2 between
the anomeric H1 and its neighboring H2 proton. The values of 3.6–4.0
Hz correspond to α-glucosides, whereas β-glucosides show
larger coupling constants of 7.8–8.4 Hz, thus, confirming the
expected stereoselective formation of α- and β-isomers
by TtSPP_R134A and UGT-76G1Sr, respectively.
Finally, the glycosidic anomeric carbon signals are observable as
a singlet at δ 98.2–101.6 and 101.1–102.6 ppm,
respectively (13C NMR, D2O).

via 1H NMR analysis of purified glycosides.

Upon coupling of racemic cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams 8 with optically
pure glucose, two cis-diastereomers (R,R)-9-G and (S,S)-9-G might be expected as enzymes are chiral
catalysts and might therefore discriminate between either of the two
enantiomeric acceptor substrates. Indeed, from the analysis of the
NMR data presented in Table 3, it becomes clear that one single product is obtained after
α-glucosylation with TtSPP_R134A. On the other
hand, a very low enantioselectivity was observed in the formation
of two isomeric β-glycosides 9-βG using the
UGT-76G1Sr/SuSy system (dr = 36:64–44:56,
as determined via 1H NMR). It should be noted, however,
that these values are determined after the isolation of glycosides,
implying the possibility that the recovery of the two diastereomers
during purification might not be equal. On the basis of the low concentration
of product, though, compared to the amount of non-reacted starting
material, sucrose, fructose, UDP, and UDP-glucose in the crude mixture,
assessment of the diastereomeric ratios based on the crude NMR data
is not reliable and practically infeasible.

In the literature,
some examples of glycosyltransferases catalyzing glycosylation reactions
with high enantioselectivity are reported, though the reaction conditions
such as temperature, (co-)solvent, enzyme formulation, additives,
etc. clearly affect the isomeric ratios obtained.67 Similarly, the β-glycosylation of compound 8a at 32 °C with acetone as a cosolvent was found to
furnish a more or less equimolar mixture of isomers, whereas a higher
selectivity was observed upon incubation at 40 °C in combination
with DMSO (dr = 44/56 and 71/29, respectively). A
more detailed study on the influence of reaction conditions on the
enantioselectivity of transferase-catalyzed transformations has not
been published yet and could thus constitute a suitable topic for
prospective research. Anyhow, it can be concluded that α-glucosylation
of cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams 8 with TtSPP_R134A takes place with a high enantioselectivity,
and thus forms an efficient route toward optically pure α-glucosides 9-αG, while opening up the opportunity to synthesize
the corresponding chiral alcohols 8.

Conclusions
Glycosylation can have a profound impact on a compound’s
solubility, activity, and bioavailability. Preparing glycosylated
molecules is, however, far from trivial. In this work, three cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams were chemically synthesized
via three straightforward steps, after which the potential of two
carbohydrate-active enzymes for the production of their corresponding
α- or β-glucosides was evaluated. These enzymes, which
were selected based on their somewhat promiscuous nature, successfully
catalyzed the intended reactions, albeit with low activity in comparison
to the reported activities on other, less demanding substrates. However,
the limited reaction rate is not surprising considering the bulky
and rigid structure of these β-lactams, and was nonetheless
sufficient to enable the production of six novel glucosides at a preparative
scale and their subsequent isolation in analytically pure form. These
findings highlight the potential of the T. thermosaccharolyticum mutant phosphorylase and the S. rebaudiana glycosyltransferase as promising catalysts for the glucosylation
of challenging molecules in general, and of cis-3-hydroxy-β-lactams
in particular. Furthermore, the glucosyl moiety is transferred from
the cheap and renewable sucrose with superior regio- and stereoselectivity
(and even enantioselectivity for α-glucosylation) without the
need for any protection or deprotection steps. Overall, the complimentary
use of classical organic synthesis and biocatalysis for glycosylation
reactions was once again shown to provide major advantages within
the framework of green chemistry.

Experimental Part
General Methods
Commercially available solvents and reagents were purchased from
common chemical suppliers and used without further purification. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400
and 100 MHz (Bruker Avance III-400), respectively, in deuterated solvents
with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. IR spectra were obtained
from samples in neat form with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR)
accessory with a PerkinElmer Spectrum BX FT-IR or a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S
WL FT-IR spectrophotometer. Melting points were measured using a Kofler
bench, type WME Heizbank of Wagner & Munz. High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) and HPLC-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent
1200 series HPLC system fitted with an Ascentis Express C18 column (particle size 2.7 μm, length 30 mm, internal diameter
4.6 mm) and connected to a UV–vis detector and an Agilent 1100
series LC/MSD-type SL mass spectrometer (ESI, 70 eV) using a mass-selective
single-quadrupole detector. A mixture of acetonitrile/water (5 mM
NH4OAc) was used as the eluent. High-resolution electron
spray (ES-TOF) mass spectra were obtained with Agilent Technologies
6210 Series Time of Flight. Automated column chromatography was performed
on a Büchi Reveleris X2 flash chromatography system (normal
phase) or Grace Reveleris X1 flash chromatography system (reversed
phase), using Reveleris C18 or Reveleris silica cartridges.
Centrifugation for harvesting cultures or performing buffer exchange
was carried out in a Sorvall RC-6 Plus rotator. Cell extracts were
sonicated in a Branson 250 sonifier (output control 3, 50% duty cycle).

Synthesis of 3-Acetoxyazetidin-2-ones 14
The
synthesis of cis-3-acetoxy-1-benzyl-4-phenylazetidin-2-one 14c serves as a general example for the synthesis of 3-acetoxyazetidin-2-ones 14a, 14b (for details, see Table 1 of section “Results
and Discussion”).

In a flask of 500 mL, 9.75 g
(50 mmol) of (E)-N-(benzylidene)benzylamine 12c, synthesized according to the literature,50 was dissolved in 120 mL dry tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed
by the addition of 20.9 mL (150 mmol; 3 equiv) triethylamine. After
cooling the reaction mixture to 0 °C using an ice bath, a solution
of 8.0 mL (75 mmol; 1.5 equiv) of acetoxyacetyl chloride 13 in 30 mL of dry THF was added dropwise. This mixture was then stirred
for 16 h at room temperature, whereupon the solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane
(300 mL), washed twice with 360 mL water, which on its turn was extracted
with 150 mL dichloromethane. Next, the combined organic phases were
dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration of the drying agent, evaporation
of the solvent, and flash chromatography with petroleum ether/ethyl
acetate (2:1) eventually yielded 10.18 g (69%) cis-3-acetoxy-1-benzyl-4-phenylazetidin-2-one 14c.

Synthesis of
3-Hydroxyazetidin-2-ones 8
The synthesis of cis-1-benzyl-3-hydroxy-4-phenylazetidin-2-one 8c serves as an example for the synthesis of 3-hydroxyazetidin-2-ones 8a and 8b.

In a flask of 50 mL, 1.62 g
(5.5 mmol) of cis-3-acetoxy-1-benzyl-4-phenylazetidin-2-one 14c was dissolved in 30 mL of a 1:1-solution of methanol and
water (2:1 for 8a). Potassium carbonate (1.52 g, 11 mmol;
2 equiv) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at
reflux temperature. Hereafter, methanol was evaporated and an extraction
was performed with 50 mL diethyl ether. The organic phase was washed
twice with 50 mL water, whereupon the aqueous phase was extracted
twice with 50 mL diethyl ether. After drying of the combined organic
phases using magnesium sulfate, filtration of the drying agent, evaporation
of the solvent and recrystallization from a mixture of ethyl acetate
and hexane (1:1), 0.86 g (62%) cis-1-benzyl-3-hydroxy-4-phenylazetidin-2-one 8c was obtained.

Enzyme Production
and Purification
The genes for mutant R134A of the T. thermosaccharolyticum sucrose 6′-phosphate
phosphorylase (TtSPP_R134A; UniProt ID D9TT09), the A. caldus sucrose synthase (SuSy; UniProt ID A0A059ZV61)
and the S. rebaudiana UDP-glucosyltransferase
(UGT-76G1Sr; UniProt ID Q6VAB4) were ligated into
expression vectors, transformed in Escherichia coli and expressed recombinantly as described in earlier work.63,64,70

Cells containing the expressed
proteins were harvested by centrifugation (20 000g, 5 min) and frozen overnight at −20 °C. Intracellular
proteins were extracted by dissolving 5 g of frozen pellet in 25 mL
of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid (MOPS), 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/mL lysozyme,
pH 7.0. In the case of glucosyltransferase, MOPS was replaced by 50
mM sodium phosphate and 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. After incubation on ice
for 30 min, the extract was exposed three times for 3 min of sonication
and centrifuged to remove the insoluble fraction (20 000g, 30 min, 4 °C). Extracts containing sucrose synthase
were used as such, while those containing sucrose 6′-phosphate
phosphorylase were subjected to heat treatment (60 °C, 1 h) and
centrifuged again. Extracts containing the glucosyltransferase were
further purified by means of nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid affinity
chromatography in gravity-flow columns as described by the supplier
(MCLab). Subsequently, the buffer was exchanged to 50 mM MOPS, pH
7.0, in 30 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck).

The
protein concentration was determined in triplicate using the BCA Protein
Assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Enzyme
Activity Determination
The activity of TtSPP_R134A and SuSy was confirmed by performing reactions where sucrose
is broken down (100 mM sucrose and 100 mM phosphate for TtSPP_R134A; 200 mM sucrose and 5 mM UDP for SuSy; 55 °C) and
following the release of reducing sugars using the BCA method. The
color reagent was prepared by combining 23 parts of a solution containing
1.5 g/L 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-biquinoline dipotassium
salt and 62.3 g/L anhydrous Na2CO3, one part
of a solution composed of 23 g/L aspartic acid, 33 g/L anhydrous Na2CO3, and 7.3 g/L CuSO4 and six parts
ethanol. The reaction samples (25 μL) were incubated with 150
μL color reagent for 30 min at 70 °C. Absorbance was measured
at 560 nm.

The activity of UGT-76G1Sr was confirmed
through a colorimetric assay, where UDP released from UDP-glucose
is converted to UTP by pyruvate kinase (PK) using phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP). This reaction generates pyruvate as well, which is in turn
reduced to lactate while oxidizing NADH to NAD+ by lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH).71 The assay mixture
consisted of 100 times diluted PK/LDH enzymes from rabbit muscle (900–1400
U/mL LDH, 600–100 U/mL PK), 5 mM MgCl2, 1.6 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mM NADH, and 0.3 mM PEP. A solution containing
UGT-76G1Sr and substrates (100 μL; 10 mM UDP-glucose,
20 mM stevioside) was added to the assay mixture (100 μL) and
absorbance at 340 nm was measured continuously.

Small-Scale
Reactions and Optimization of Reaction Conditions
Small-scale
reactions were carried out at 200 μL scale in Eppendorf tubes.
The α-glucosylation reactions contained 1 M sucrose, 15 mM acceptor,
10% (v/v) organic solvent, 0.1 mg/mL TtSPP_R134A,
and 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), and were incubated at 55 °C. The β-glucosylation
reactions contained 200 mM sucrose, 15 mM acceptor, 10% (v/v) organic
solvent, 0.2 mg/mL UGT-76G1Sr, 1 mg/mL SuSy, and
50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), and were incubated at 32 °C. A 1 μL
sample was taken after 24 h, spotted on silica gel 60 F254 precoated plates (Merck) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography
using a mixture of EtOAc/MeOH/H2O (30:5:4) as the eluent.
Spots were visualized by charring with 10% (v/v) H2SO4.

Reactions were optimized by assessing various solvents,
i.e., 2-phenylethanol, methanol, isobutanol, 2-methylbutan-2-ol, acetone,
methyl t-butyl ether, diethyl ether, and acetonitrile.
Additionally, the acceptor concentration was varied (5–30 mM).

Synthesis of 3-O-α-d-Glucopyranosyl-3-hydroxyazetidin-2-ones 9-αG and Downstream Processing
The production
of α-glucosides 9a-αG, 9b-αG, and 9c-αG was carried out using mutant TtSPP_R134A at a scale of 100, 25, or 50 mL, respectively.
Each reaction contained 1 M sucrose, 10 v/v% acetone, 0.04–0.06
mg/mL TtSPP_R134A, 50 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.0), and
21 mM of acceptor 8a or 15 mM of acceptor 8b or 8c. These reaction samples were incubated for 8–22
days at 55 °C with a reflux condenser, and stirred magnetically
(IKA RCt Classic). The reaction samples (50 μL) were inactivated
by adding 50 μL acetonitrile and 50 μL ultrapure water,
followed by centrifugation. These samples were analyzed by LC-MS (eluent:
10–100% CH3CN in water (5 mM NH4OAc)).

The α-glucosides were first purified by double extraction
with isopropyl alcohol, to which NaCl was added (300 mg/mL) to obtain
a biphasic system. The organic phase was washed with water to remove
any remaining sugars, followed by evaporation under reduced pressure.
The remaining product was dissolved in methanol, filtered for the
removal of leftover salts and evaporated again. Subsequently, automatic
column chromatography was performed (gradual increase in polarity
of the eluent: petroleum ether/EtOAc (100:0) to petroleum ether/EtOAc
(0:100) to EtOAc/MeOH/H2O (30:5:4)). Minor impurities were
finally removed via preparative TLC.
