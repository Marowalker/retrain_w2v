This paper focused
on the treatment of vanadium–chromium reducing residue with
a two-step alkaline leaching process: electro-oxidation leaching of
vanadium and H2O2 as well as oxidation leaching
of chromium in an alkaline medium. The effects of experimental parameters
on the leaching performance of vanadium and chromium were investigated.
The experimental data showed that in the first alkaline leaching in
stage I, the leaching efficiency of vanadium reached up to 95.32%
under optimal conditions, while most of the chromium could not leach
out (about 4% of chromium was leached out). Chromium was easily oxidized
to high valence (CrO42–) with H2O2 in the second alkaline leaching stage II. Under optimal
conditions, 96.24% chromium was leached out.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Vanadium, chromium, and their oxides are widely used in many fields
due to their excellent properties.1−5 In a vanadium plant, wastewater containing CrO42– and VO43– is generated and the vanadium–chromium
reducing residue is formed via the reducing treatment of these wastewaters.
Thus, vanadium and chromium in the residue exist almost as V(III)
and Cr(III). Handling of the vanadium chromium reducing residue has
become a thorny problem in many plants in China.6,7

Many hydrometallurgy technologies have been investigated to improve
the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium. Nowadays, the most
common and commercial technology for recovery of vanadium and chromium
is the roasting–leaching process, which includes sodium-roasting–water
leaching8 and calcium-roasting–acid
leaching.9−11 Unfortunately,
a series of problems of the sodium salt roasting technology are still
unsolved, such as emission of hazardous gases, fusion agglomeration
at a high roasting temperature, and utilization difficulty of tailings.
The calcium-roasting–acid leaching technology appears to be
an environmental method for leaching of vanadium while not an efficient
technology for recovery of chromium.11−13 The so-called submolten salt technology introduced
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences is an efficient technology for
vanadium leaching out but the process consumes much energy and is
uneconomical.14,15 Some oxidation–alkaline
leaching technologies have been adopted, such as NaOH–H2O2 leaching16,17 or NaOH and electro-oxidation.7,18−21 Vanadium could be leached out efficiently,
but chromium could not be leached out. As
a result, the vanadium–chromium reducing residue had not been
treated effectively, resulting in wasting the vanadium and chromium
resources as well as causing environmental pollution.

This paper
focused on the treatment of the vanadium–chromium reducing
residue with a two-step alkaline leaching process. In the first step,
an electric field was applied to oxidize the low-valence vanadium.
The effects of experimental parameters including the current density,
the reaction temperature, the reaction time, and the dosage of NaOH
on the selective oxidation of the low-valence vanadium were studied. After
selective leaching, chromium(III) was oxidized by H2O2 in an alkaline medium. The effects of experimental parameters
on the leaching performance of chromium were also investigated. Optimal
leaching conditions of vanadium and chromium were also developed.

2 Results and Discussion
The results shown in Figure 14 indicate that
vanadium and chromium in the residue
were of low valence, and hence they could not be directly leached
out easily in the alkaline medium. It was found that E0 (V(V)/V(IV)) and E0 (Cr(VI)/Cr(III))
were 1.00 and 1.33 V, respectively.22 In
other words, special oxidation treatment of the vanadium–chromium
reducing residue could achieve selective oxidation of low-valence
vanadium and chromium(III) not
oxidized. The E–pH diagrams for the V–H2O system and the Cr–H2O system at 25 °C
are shown in Figure 1(6,23) and Figure 2, respectively. It could be seen that the potential for Cr(VI)
was much higher than that for V(V) in the alkaline medium. When the
pH > 10, the potential remained about 0.25 V and vanadium existed
as VO3–, while chromium was still in
the Cr(III) form. Thus, a suitable potential could be applied as vanadium
existed as V(V) and chromium existed as Cr(III), according to the
results shown in Figures 1 and 2. A recent study7 indicated that a selective leaching process could be achieved
by enhancing the electric filed in the alkaline medium. Therefore,
in this paper, vanadium and chromium were separated and recovered
by a two-step leaching process: electro-oxidation leaching of vanadium
and H2O2 as well as oxidation leaching of chromium
in an alkaline medium. The schematic is shown in Figure 3.

2.1 Leaching
of Vanadium
2.1.1 Effect of Dosage of NaOH
As the main
reactant, the dosage of NaOH (m(NaOH)/m(residue)) had a significant effect on the leaching process. Several
experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of the dosage
of NaOH on the leaching process. Other reaction conditions were kept
constant: liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S) of 4 mL/g, reaction temperature
(T) of 90 °C, reaction time (t) of 120 min, and stirring rate (r) of 500 rpm.

The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that the dosage of NaOH had a positive effect on
the leaching efficiency of vanadium. The leaching efficiency of vanadium
could increase 19.32% under optimal reaction conditions and increased
with the increase in the electric field. At the same time, the leaching
efficiency of chromium was 4.2% at its maximum.

Figure 4 Effect of the dosage
of NaOH on the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium (T = 90 °C, t = 120 min, L/S = 4 mL/g
and r = 500 rpm).

2.1.2 Effect of Current Density
An electric field was introduced
to enhance the leaching process,
and the effect of current density (J) on the leaching
process was studied while the other reaction conditions were kept
constant: T = 90 °C, m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0 g/g, t = 120 min, L/S
= 4 mL/g, and r = 500 rpm, respectively.

The
results shown in Figure 5 indicate that the current density had a positive effect on the leaching
efficiency of vanadium. Vanadium existed in low valence as V(III)
and V(IV) in the residue, as seen from Figure 14. During the leaching process, the H2O molecule or OH– was oxidized to •OH by the electric field.7,24,25 Then it migrated toward the bulk solution and reacted with the low-valence
vanadium in the residue and oxidized it to high-valence vanadium (V(V)),
which highly dissolved in the alkaline medium. The reactions during
the leaching process can be expressed by the model shown in Figure 6 and the equations
as follows7,18 1   2   3   4   5   6  where MOx stands for the metal electrode.

Figure 5 Effect of current
density on the leaching efficiency of
vanadium and chromium (T = 90 °C, m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0 g/g, t =
120 min, L/S = 4 mL/g and r = 500 rpm).

Figure 6 Reaction model for the
leaching of vanadium.

2.1.3 Effect of Reaction Temperature
Figure 7 describes
the effect of the reaction temperature on the leaching process while
the other reaction conditions were kept constant: t = 120 min, m(NaOH)/m(residue)
= 1.0:1.0 g/g, J = 0.25 A/cm2, L/S = 4
mL/g, and r = 500 rpm. The results showed that the
leaching efficiency of vanadium increased linearly with the reaction
temperature. Therefore, a reaction temperature of 90 °C was chosen
as the optimal condition for further experiments.

Figure 7 Effect of reaction temperature
on the leaching efficiency of vanadium
and chromium (t = 120 min, m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, J = 0.25 A/cm2, L/S = 4 mL/g, and r = 500 rpm).

2.1.4 Effect of Reaction Time
To investigate the effect of
reaction time, several experiments
based on the reaction time from 30 to 150 min were carried out, and
the results are shown in Figure 8. The leaching efficiency of vanadium increased with
the increase of reaction time from 30 to 120 min. A prolonged reaction
time had a negative effect on the leaching efficiency of vanadium.
As the time increased from 30 to 120 min, the oxidation of low-valence
vanadium tended to balance and the leaching efficiency increased from
60.02% at 30 min to 95.32% at 120 min. Therefore, the reaction time
of 120 min was chosen as the optimal time.

Figure 8 Effect of reaction time
on the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium (t = 90 °C, m(NaOH)/m(residue)
= 1.0:1.0 g/g, J = 0.25 A/cm2, L/S = 4
mL/g and r = 500 rpm).

2.1.5 Composition
of Vanadium and Chromium Residue
after Leaching in Stage I
The composition of the leaching
residue in stage I is detailed in Table 1, which was obtained after selective leaching
of vanadium under optimal conditions: m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, J = 0.25 A/cm2, L/S = 4 mL/ g, T = 90 °C, t = 120 min, and r = 500 rpm. It could
be seen that vanadium was almost leached out and only 0.15 wt % was
retained in the residue, which was consistent with the experimental
results mentioned above. Chromium was about 28.05 wt %, and the leaching
residue could be used as a chromium resource for chromium recovery.

amount (wt %)	38.77	28.05	10.16	18.38	0.82	0.15	2.42	0.36	0.49	0.03	
2.2 Leaching of Chromium
The results
shown in Table 1 indicate
that chromium was almost retained in the leaching
residue. In the second leaching process, H2O2 was added to oxidize the low-valence chromium, according to refs (17, 18, 22).

2.2.1 Effect of Dosage of H2O2
H2O2 as a main
oxidant played an important role during the leaching process. The
effect of dosage of H2O2 (V(H2O2)/m(residue)) on the
leaching process was investigated under the following conditions: m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, L/S =
4.0 mL/g, T = 90 °C, t = 120
min, and r = 500 rpm. The results shown in Figure 9 indicate that the
dosage of H2O2 had a significant positive effect
on the leaching process, and the leaching efficiency of chromium increased
linearly with the increase in the dosage of H2O2. With the addition of H2O2, the low-valence
chromium was oxidized to water-soluble chromate (CrO42–) in the alkaline medium. Also, the results indicated
that vanadium that remained in the leaching residue was easily leached
out.

mass of residue on the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium
(m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g,
L/S = 4.0 mL/g, T = 90 °C, t = 120 min and r = 500 rpm).

2.2.2 Effect
of Dosage of NaOH
During the oxidation process, NaOH was
not only an important reactant but also provided an alkaline medium. Figure 10 shows that the
dosage of NaOH significantly affected the leaching process. The leaching
efficiency increased from 55.13% at m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 0.2:1.0 g/g to 96.24% at m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g.

Figure 10 Effect of
mass ratio of NaOH to residue
on the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium(V(H2O2)/m(residue) = 1.0 mL/g,
L/S = 4.0 mL/g, T = 90 °C, t =120 min and r = 500 rpm).

2.2.3 Effect of Reaction Temperature
A higher temperature
could increase the activity of atoms and molecules,
increase collisions, increase the reaction rate, etc. The effect of
reaction temperature was studied under the standard conditions: m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, L/S =
4.0 mL/g, t = 120 min, and V(H2O2)/m(residue) = 1.0 mL/g and r = 500 rpm. It was concluded from the results shown in Figure 11 that the reaction
temperature also had a positive effect on the leaching process. The
highest leaching efficiency was 96.24% at a reaction temperature of
90 °C. Thus, 90 °C was chosen as the optimal condition.

Figure 11 Effect
of reaction
temperature on the leaching efficiency of vanadium and chromium (m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, L/S =
4.0 mL/g, t = 120 min, V(H2O2)/m(residue) = 1.0 mL/g and r = 500 rpm).

2.2.4 Effect of Reaction
Time
As seen in Figure 12, the effect of reaction time was investigated as m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, L/S =
4.0 mL/g, T = 90 °C, V(H2O2)/m(residue) = 1.0 mL/g and r = 500 rpm, respectively. The results indicated that the
leaching efficiency of chromium was increased from 30 to 120 min.
The oxidation of chromium tended to balance at a reaction time from
30 to 120 min, and the leaching of chromium was up to 96.24% at 120
min and increased only 0.1% at 150 min. Thus, the reaction time of
120 min was chosen as the optimal condition.

Figure 12 Effect of reaction time
on the leaching efficiency of
chromium and vanadium (m(NaOH)/m(residue) = 1.0:1.0 g/g, L/S = 4.0 mL/g, T = 90
°C, V(H2O2)/m(residue) = 1.0 mL/g and r = 500 rpm).

2.3 Phase Analysis
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis of the residue after leaching stage II
was conducted. The result shown in Figure 13 indicates that the main content phases
of the original residue disappeared and only a peak of SiO2 and Fe2(SO4)3 remained after leaching.
In other words, vanadium and chromium in the original residue leached
out, which was consistent with the results discussed above.

after leaching stage II.

3 Conclusions
An
electric field and H2O2, as an efficient oxidant,
were successfully applied in the two-step alkaline leaching process.(1) Low-valence vanadium
could be oxidized to high-valence vanadium by applying an electric
field. The addition of an electric field enhanced the leaching process
of vanadium, while chromium was hardly leached out. The overall leaching
efficiency of vanadium reached up to 95.32% under optimal conditions:
mass ratio of NaOH-to-residue, 1.0:1.0 g/g; current density, 0.25
A/cm2; liquid-to-solid ratio, 4 mL/g; reaction temperature,
90 °C; reaction time, 120 min; and stirring rate, 500 rpm.

(2) Chromium was retained
in the leaching residue after leaching stage I and it was easily oxidized
to high valence (CrO42–) with H2O2 in an alkaline medium in leaching stage II. Under optimal
conditions, 96.24% chromium was leached out: mass ratio of NaOH-to-residue,
1.0:1.0 g/g; liquid-to-solid ratio, 4.0 mL/g; reaction temperature,
90 °C; reaction time, 120 min; volume ratio of H2O2 to mass of residue, 1.0 mL/g; and stirring rate, 500 rpm.
