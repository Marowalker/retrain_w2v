Lithium-ion capacitors
(LICs) are noticed as a new-type of energy
storage device with both capacitive mechanism and battery mechanism.
The LICs own outstanding power density and energy density. In our
work, an LIC was constructed by using a simple method to prepare a
bimetallic sulfide of CoMoS4 nanoparticles as the anode
and a self-made biochar [fructus cannabis’s shells (FCS)] with
excellent specific surface area as the cathode. The CoMoS4//FCS LIC demonstrated that the range of energy density is from 10
to 41.9 W h/kg and the range of power density is from 75 to 3000 W/kg
in the meantime, and it also demonstrated a remarkable cycling performance
with the capacitance retention of 95% after 10 000 cycles of
charging–discharging at 1 A/g. The designed CoMoS4//FCS LIC device exhibits a superior electrochemical performance
because of the CoMoS4 loose porous structure leading to
excellent dynamic performance, which is conducive to the diffusion
of electrolyte and lithium ion transport, and good electric double
layer performance of biochar with large specific surface area could
be achieved. Therefore, this bimetallic sulfide is a promising active
material for LICs, which could be applied to electric vehicles in
the future.

Introduction
The rapid development
of today’s society has led to the
inability of energy to meet the needs of human. Also, the current
energy systems mainly include coal, oil, and natural gas, while the
clean energy accounts for a small proportion, such as solar energy,
geothermal energy, tidal energy, and so on. This unreasonable proportion
of the status has seriously affected the development of mankind. Thus,
we must change the irrational current situation. For traditional energy
resources, they are nonrenewable, limited, and accompanied with serious
environmental pollution. The clean energy resources possess many advantages
compared with the former. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an
eco-friendly and reusable energy resources to meet the energy needs
of the future society. On one hand, the rapid development and ubiquitous
use of the large-scale application apparatus demand energy storage
equipment; on the other hand, high energy and large power energy storage
devices have become the key to mass production of electric vehicles
(EVs). Among the energy storage devices, electrochemical energy storage
equipment stand out because of their excellent electrochemical performances,
such as eco-friendly, outstanding rate capability, and convenient
portability.1

For the current electrochemical
energy-storage systems, lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) have been attracting increasing
attention because of their wide use in our social activities.2,3 From the perspective of energy storage mechanism, the energy storage
mechanism of the electric energy conversion of SCs (electrochemical
capacitors) is realized by establishing an electric double layer at
the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. Nevertheless,
LIB oxidation–reduction reactions of the interface are to achieve
energy storage.4 In terms of actual electrochemical
performance, LIBs deliver higher energy density (150–200 W
h/kg) but lower power density, while SCs provide higher power density
(2–5 kW/kg) and excellent cycle life but lower energy density.5−7 In consequence, it is a meaningful try to design a kind of electrochemical
energy storage device capable of both higher energy and higher power.
On the basis of the concept of hybridization, a new-type of storage
device with advantages of LIBs and SCs, the discovery of lithium-ion
capacitor (LIC) has attracted much attention.8−10

The LIC
is a hybrid mechanism energy storage device, also known
as lithium-ion hybrid capacitor. This hybrid system combines the advantages
of the SCs and the LIBs to make up for the Ragone curve with large
energy density and large power density of the electrochemical energy
storage device vacancies.11−13 LICs usually consist of a LIB-type
anode and a SC-type cathode, while the advantages of this design are
that a combination of rapid charging and discharging of the capacitor-type
material and a large capacity of battery-type material characteristics.14−16 During the operation of the LICs, the adsorption/desorption of hexafluorophosphate
ions (PF6–) occurs in the positive electrode,
while the intercalation/de-intercalation of the cation occurs on the
negative electrode.17−19 This hybrid capacitor combines the advantages of
SCs and LIBs, and the actual performance exhibited is closer to ethylene
carbonates (ECs).20 The potential merits
of (LIC) will be more apparent in the area of future energy storage
devices.

Research into this hybrid LIC started in 2001 when
Amatucci and
his colleagues first constructed devices that use Li4Ti5O12 as the anode and cheap commercial activated
carbon (AC) as the cathode.21 Since then,
various new materials have been used in the negative and positive
materials of such hybrid systems. There are also differences in the
performance of LICs constructed from different materials. Generally,
LIC positive materials mainly use porous carbon materials that possess
excellent specific surface area. AC becomes frequently used positive
material because of its specific surface area and lower cost. In LICs,
there are three types positive materials in the light of the mechanisms.
The first type is insertion material. LiTi2(PO4)3,22 LiCrTiO4,23 Li2Ti3O7,24 and TiP2O725 are as examples. The second type is conversion
material such as (Fe2O3,26 V2O5,27 TiO2,63 and Nb2O528). The third type is alloying
material incorporating dome-patterned silicon/copper29 and B–Si/SiO2/C.30 Although as traditional battery-type electrode materials, insertion-type
positive has excellent structural stability, low specific capacity
limits performance of energy density of LICs.31 However, the conversion metal oxide with pseudocapacitive behavior
is considered to be a better selection by reason of its large theoretical
capacity (500–1000 mA h/g), outstanding high-power performance,
and reliable cycle stability. However, this type shows poor electrical
conductivity, which needs to be overcome in application of LICs. Recently,
metal nitride vanadium nitride32 and metal
carbide titanium carbide (TiC)33 have been
regarded as prospective LIC positive materials because of their good
electrical conductivity and rich oxidation–reduction reaction
valence state. This trend indicates that other transition metal compounds
are used as positive materials for LICs, showing that there is room
for further development. For the time being, transition metal sulfides
are identified as prospective electrode materials because of their
higher theoretical capacity, and materials such as Co9S834 and Ni3S235 have been used in batteries and SCs.
For LIC materials, transition metal sulfide is relatively rare, such
as CoNi2S436 and
TiS2.37 This type of material
has a space for development in the LIC.

In our work, we adopted
the coprecipitation reaction system to
prepare CoMoS4 nanoparticles as the anode because a bimetallic
sulfide has richer redox reactions and higher electrical conductivity
than single metal sulfides. The literature has reported that CoMoS4 is used as an SC electrode material and got a specific capacity.38 We performed a series of physical and chemical
properties experiments as well as electrochemical tests to prove that
its properties make it suitable as the LIC electrode materials. Then,
a self-made biochar [fructus cannabis’s shells (FCS)] with
an environmental friendly, well-pore structure and excellent surface
area was used as the cathode. Finally, a button cell was used as a
container to construct an LIC to evaluate its actual performance.
As described in detail in this report, the CoMoS4//FCS
LIC demonstrated that the range of energy density is from 10 to 41.9
W h/kg and the range of power density is from 75 to 3000 W/kg in the
meantime. Simultaneously, the capacity retention rate approached 95%
after a cycle of 10 000 at 1 A/g.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra of CoMoS4 nanoparticles, which reveal that the materials consist of 18.21%
Co, 17.97% Mo, and 63.82% S. Compared with CoMoS4 (with
stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:4), the slight difference of the stoichiometric
ratio is due to the weak peak of oxygen about 0.5 keV. Figure 1b shows that the CoMoS4 nanoparticles were determined by powder X-ray diffractometer
(XRD), and no diffraction peaks were observed in the pattern, indicating
that the as-obtained sample is an amorphous crystal structure, which
is in accord with the previous results in the literature.39−41 Compared to good crystal structure materials, the structure has
more channels for lithium ion transport and is conductive to a better
capacity characteristics of electrode materials. In order to further
figure out the chemical component of the as-obtained CoMoS4 nanoparticles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to
test the samples and the XPS results are shown in Figure 1. The XPS survey spectrum for
the as-obtained CoMoS4 nanoparticles (Figure 1c) indicates that the sample
consists of Co, Mo, and S elements. That is, the S 2p spectrum (Figure 1f), it can be divided
into the two main peaks located at 163.2 and 162.3 eV in the S 2p
core level spectrum could be ascribed to S 2p1/2 and S
2p3/2 and one satellite peak at 168.7 eV. On the surface,
the sulfur ions at poor complexing results in the peak at 162.0 eV,
while the trait of metal–sulfur bonds identifies with the ingredient
at 163.2 eV.42Figure 1e shows the spectrum of Mo 3d. As regards
the Mo 3d5/2, the peak locates at 228.9 eV, while for the
S 2s photoelectrons, the peak locates at 226.5 eV.41 The peak located at 232.2 eV assigns to the Mo 3d3/2 for CoMoS4, molybdenum is validating that the oxidation
state is similar to that in the (NH4)2[Mo6+S4] precursor.43,44 In addition,
the peak at ∼235.1 eV also indicates the existence of molybdenum
(Mo6+).45Figure 1d shows the spectrum of Co 2p. The Co 2p1/2 region displayed a peak at 797.5 eV and one satellite peak
at 802.9 eV;46 the peak at 784.3 eV can
be assigned to Co2+.47 Binding
energies of 782.1 eV in the Co 2p core level spectrum can be attributed
to Co 2p3/2. In the CoMoS4 nanoparticles, in
a sulfidic environment, the mutual effect of Co atoms and Mo species
(Co–Mo–S species) is identified with the peaks at 779.5
and 794.1 eV.41 Moreover, the Co 2p3/2 binding energy of 779.5 eV is higher than the Co9S8 binding energy value and approaches the Co–Mo–S
phase,38,48 suggesting that Co2+ ions are
bonded with MoS42–,49 leading to the formation of the CoMoS4 phase.50 The above test results show that the sample
composition is close to CoMoS4; the following equations
show the forming process of CoMoS4 nanoparticles39 1

Figure 2a,b shows
the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the interconnecting
nanoparticles are the CoMoS4 sample with a loosely packed
porous structure. It can be seen that the size of nanoparticles ranges
from 10 to 100 nm in Figure 2b. This structure is in accord with the results of the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure 2c. This loose porous structure has good kinetic
properties, which is conducive to the diffusion of electrolyte and
lithium ion transport. The high multiples of TEM in Figure 2d and the selected-area electron
diffraction illustrations also confirm the structure of CoMoS4 is amorphous, and result also corresponds to the XRD pattern.
The selected area of Figure 2e shows the typical scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) image and the corresponding elemental mapping images of the
CoMoS4 sample; Figure 2f shows that Co, Mo, and S atoms are uniformly distributed
in the selected area.

Half-cell assemblies were used to evaluate the electrochemical
performance of a single electrode (CoMoS4 and FCS). The
CoMoS4 electrode was subjected to a stable prelithiation
process by charge–discharge cycle at a current density of 0.1
A/g in a Li half-cell until the capacity reached a stable level. The
cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the half-cell (prelithiated CoMoS4/Li metal) with a scan rate between 0.1 and 10 mV/s are shown
in Figure 3a. Cathodic
and anodic peaks appear in the vicinity of 1.3 and 1.5 V, reflecting
the Li+ insertion/extraction processes in charging and
discharging processes. This trend is similar to the previously reported
pseudocapacitive material in the potential range from 0.01 to 3 V
(vs Li/Li+),36 discussing the
lithium ion capacitance where the contribution of the capacitive is
extremely important for pseudocapacitive materials. The following
quantitative analysis of capacitance contribution was made by the
method from Dunn and co-workers.51,52 Usually, the
current and scan rate satisfy the following relationship 2  where both a and b are adjustable values, i is the current,
and v is the sweep rate. The sweep rate in logarithm
and plotting current can be used to calculate b-value.
Different b-value has its designated currently reactive
control, the semi-infinite linear diffusion presents b-value of 0.5, while surface control presents b-value
of 1. The b-value of CoMoS4 electrode
peaks is 0.84 with a scan rate between 0.1 and 10 mV/s in illustration
of Figure 1a. b-Value is much closer to 1 to indicate that the material
exhibits mainly pseudocapacitive characteristics. In order to further
explore the contribution of capacitance under the different current
density, the current was divided into pseudocapacitive effects (k1v) and diffusion-controlled
insertion (k2v1/2).53 The corresponding equation is 3  v denoted
in the equation
is the sweep rate, while the current can be distinguished two fractions
arising from Li+ insertion and that from capacitive processes
by determining both k1 and k2. Figure 3b demonstrates the CV profile
that has the shaded area representing the contribution of pseudocapacitance
at the scan rate of 1 mV/s, which accounts for 51.66% of the total.
As shown in Figure 3c, the pseudocapacitance contribution ratios are 36.9, 44.6, 51.66,
61.87, and 75.08% at scan rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mV/s, respectively.
The analysis of b-value, capacitance contribution
rate, and experimental results show that the lithium storage behavior
of the CoMoS4 electrode is mainly carried out by the way
of pseudocapacitive behavior, which is favorable for fast charge storage
and long-term cyclability.54,55 In order to prove that
the CoMoS4 electrode lithium ion storage conduct is a principal
pseudocapacitive after the capacity is stable, we have implemented
the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests of the CoMoS4 electrode in half-cell (Figure S1). Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is
about 35 Ω in the light of the high frequency semicircle in Figure S1. Obviously, the slope of the Warburg
impedance surpasses 1, which manifests the low frequency curve. The
foregoing considerations indicate that influence of diffusion control
gets small after the capacity is stable.

of CoMoS4 at the current density of 0.1 A/g.

Figure 3d shows
the rate capability of all CoMoS4 electrodes, when the
current density increases from 100, 200, 500, 1000 to 2000 mA/g, the
corresponding discharge capacity is 198, 106, 57, 43, and 34 mA h/g.
Finally, when the current density is restored to 100 mA/g, the corresponding
discharge capacity also returns to 185 mA h/g. This shows the good
capacity reversibility of the CoMoS4 electrode. The galvanostatic
charge–discharge curves of the CoMoS4/Li at 0.1
A/g current density in the potential range from 0.01 to 3.0 V (vs
Li/Li+) are presented in Figure 3e. It can be seen that there is no obvious
platform after the capacity reaches stability. This proves that the
CoMoS4 sample is a pseudocapacitive material. After the
first cycle, there is an irreversible capacity loss. The reason for
this capacity loss may be due to other side reactions.56Figure 3f presents the cyclic curves at 0.1 A/g. Figure 3e,f shows an interesting phenomenon:
from the second cycle to the 60th cycles, the capacity dropped from
1200 to 100 mA h/g, but after 60th cycles it increased. On the 150th
cycles, the capacity reached 185 mA h/g and remained stable and then
rose again. Additionally, the coulombic efficiencies of the CoMoS4 reached to 100%. The increase of capacity during cycling
might be attributed to the improved Li-ion diffusion kinetics by a
gradual activation process and reversible reactions between metal
particles and electrolytes, which has also been observed with several
other anode materials.57−61

Figure 4a is
the
SEM image of the FCS sample, the sample shows a highly connected porous
structure, similar to coral. This structure provides space for diffusion
and transport of electrolyte ions and improves the storage of surface
charges. In reality, what is much crucial to the electric double layer
capacitors (EDLCs) performance is that the interconnected pores are
very adaptive for the electrolyte ion adsorption and diffusion.62Figure 4b shows the CV curve of a half-cell device (FCS/Li metal)
in the potential range between 1.5 and 4.5 V (vs Li/Li+). It can be seen that the pattern is an approximately rectangular
shape at all scan rates, which indicates that the FCS electrode is
mainly EDLC and contains a small amount of pseudocapacitor behavior.
The source of pseudocapacitance behavior is due to the small amount
of impurity atoms contained in the FCS feedstock. From the charge and discharge curves of FCS and commercial AC at the current densities
of 1 A/g shown in Figure 4c, obvious contrast between the two can be seen that the capacity
of FCS (100 F/g) is almost double that of AC (63 F/g). Also, the discharge
capacity remains essentially unchanged after the 100th cyclic curves
at the current density of 0.1 A/g as shown in Figure 4d. Even after 1000 cycles, the discharge
capacity remained good (Figure S2). At
the same time, we showed the rate capability of the cathode: when
the current density increases from 100, 200, 500, 1000 to 2000 mA/g,
the corresponding discharge capacity is 110, 100, 90, 80, and 75 mA
h/g (Figure S3). The nitrogen adsorption
and desorption isotherms were tested at −196 °C to further
understand the pore structure of this sample. The isotherm with a
distinct hysteresis loop shown in Figure 4f and the pore-size distribution plots shown
in Figure 4e consistently
indicate that this sample contains some mesopores and macropores and
many micropores. The adsorption data were calculated by the standard
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method; therefore, the specific
surface area is 1739.8 m2/g.

In order to assemble a large-voltage
window and a large-energy-density
LIC, the charges of the positive and the negative should be balanced
(Qanode = Qcathode). The key to ensuring the balance of charge is the quality matching
of the anode and cathode active materials. The equation Q = C·m displays that mass
(m) and the stored charge associate with the specific
capacity (C) of the electrode, so the mass ratio
of the anode and cathode electrodes can be calculated by the following
equation: 4  ΔV and C are the potential window during charge and discharge of
the cathode
and anode, respectively, and the specific capacitances, m is the mass. In CoMoS4//FCS, this charge balance is achieved
by controlling the mass of the positive and negative active materials
by mass ratio. The stabilized capacity is 185 and 102 mA h/g as shown
in Figures 3f and 4d, respectively. Through the capacity ratio, the
anode and cathode masses were determined as 0.8 and 1.4 mg. Before
assembling LICs, the CoMoS4 electrode was subjected to
a stable prelithiation process by charge–discharge cycle at
a current density of 0.1 A/g in a Li half-cell until the capacity
reached a stable level to obtain a high retention of capacity and
ended in a state of charging to 2.01 V (a cross potential of a positive
electrode discharge and a negative electrode charge). In the same
way, the FCS electrode was pre-activated for 10 cycles and ended in
a state of discharging to 2.01 V (Figure S5). After that, the equipotential prelithiated anode (CoMoS4) and the activated cathode (FCS) were assembled into an LIC in the
form of a button cell in a nitrogen glovebox. The composition of the
CoMoS4//FCS LIC device is shown in Figure 5a, prelithiated CoMoS4 is used
as a anode and activated FCS as a cathode in 1 mol LiPF6 in EC/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1)
electrolyte solution.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic of the LIC based on FCS cathode and CoMoS4 anode, (b) CV curves of CoMoS4//FCS LIC at different
scan rates range from 2 to 50 mV/s, (c) galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves of CoMoS4//FCS LIC at different current densities,
(d) Ragone plot of CoMoS4//FCS LIC with scattered points
designate the data of LICs taken from the literature, and (e) long-term
cycle performance of CoMoS4//FCS LIC.

The CV curves of CoMoS4//FCS LIC are exhibited
in Figure 5b. The different
scan rate CV curves at 2–50 mV/s exhibit a shape that is different
from the perfect rectangle of a traditional symmetric type SC due
to the different energy storage mechanisms of the positive and negative,
the homologous voltage testing window was chosen between 0 and 3 V.
As shown in Figure 5c, the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves are at different
current densities. It can be seen that the curves presents an approximate
isosceles triangle. This linear slope is expected for hybrid capacitor.
The mass specific capacitance (C) was calculated
using formula C = i·t/m·ΔV, where i is the applied current, t is the discharge
time, ΔV is the potential difference (not including
the ohmic drop), and m is the total mass of the two
electrode. At the current densities of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and
2 A/g, the device exhibits a capacity of 33.5, 26.75, 13.5, 11, 9.75,
and 8 F/g, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
was used to characterize the CoMoS4//FCS LIC (Figure S4). Rs presents
the resistance of cell components and electrolyte, Rs of the CoMoS4//FCS LIC was estimated to be
7 Ω. Charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is about 39 Ω in the light of the high frequency semicircle
in Figure S1. Obviously, the slope of the
Warburg impedance surpasses 1, which manifests the low frequency curve.
The foregoing considerations indicate that electrolyte ions can diffuse
rapidly into this loose porous structure of CoMoS4 nanoparticles.64

Figure 5d shows
the Ragone plots of CoMoS4//FCS LICs. The energy and power
density of the LIC were calculated using the following equations: 5   6   7  where t is the discharge
time, Vmax and Vmin are the upper and lower voltages during the charge–discharge
process, and C is the mass specific capacitance.
The CoMoS4//FCS LIC exhibited highest power density and
energy density in the LICs. Particularly, the CoMoS4//FCS
LIC demonstrated that the range of energy density is from 10 to 41.9
W h/kg and the range of power density is from 75 to 3000 W/kg in the
meantime (Table 1).
Even more noteworthy is the cycling performance of the CoMoS4//FC LIC. In Figure 5e, the capacity retention rate approached 95% after a cycle of 10 000
at 1 A/g. The CoMoS4//FCS LIC device exhibiting a superior
electrochemical performance is due to the fact that CoMoS4 loose porous structure has excellent dynamic performance, which
is conducive to the diffusion of electrolyte and lithium ion transport.
Also, good electric double layer performance
of biochar with high specific surface area could be achieved. Therefore,
this bimetallic sulfide is a promising active material for LICs, which
could be applied to EVs in the future.

Conclusions
In
summary, the interconnecting nanoparticles of the CoMoS4 sample with a loosely packed porous structure were fabricated
with a simple chemical coprecipitation method as the LIC anode material.
Meanwhile, a self-made biochar (FCS) with an environmental friendly,
well-pore structure and excellent surface area were used as the cathode
materials. In this, the LIC (CoMoS4//FCS) with considerable
performance was designed and manufactured by the prelithiated CoMoS4 anode and the FCS cathode. The consequences uncover that
this structure of CoMoS4 nanoparticles has more lithium
ion transport channels and considerable contribution of pseudocapacitance
is conductive to better capacity characteristics of electrode materials,
and well-pore structure of FCS excellent surface area provides space
for diffusion and transport of electrolyte ions and optimizes the
storage of surface charges. Moreover, the CoMoS4//FCS LIC
demonstrated that the range of energy density is from 10 to 41.9 W
h/kg and the range of power density is from 75 to 3000 W/kg in the
meantime. Simultaneously, the capacity retention rate approached 95%
after a cycle of 10 000 at 1 A/g. Therefore, this bimetallic
sulfide is a promising active material for LICs, which could be applied
to EVs in the future.

Experiment Section
Preparation of the (NH4)2MoS4 Precursor
All the chemicals
have been used in this work
were of analytical grade, which can be directly used after purchase.
It was a typical synthesis procedure that 12.5 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24 was dissolved in 30 mL
of deionized water into a three-necked flask with vigorous stirring,
then adding 15 mL ammonia water into the three-necked flask under
vigorous stirring. With that, 113 mL of (NH4)2S solution (S % = 8 wt %) was then added to this solution and the
mixture was further maintained at 70 °C for 2 h. The product
was cooled to room temperature, crystallized for 12 h, and then rinsed
with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water many times. Finally, the
samples were dried at room temperature for 12 h to obtain (NH4)2MoS4. The mechanism of preparing the
(NH4)2MoS4 crystal can be expressed
as eqs 8 and 9 8   9  

Preparation of CoMoS4 Nanoparticles
The
CoMoS4 nanoparticles were synthesized by the coprecipitation
reaction system. CoCl2·6H2O (0.5 g) and
0.6 g of the as-prepared (NH4)2MoS4 were dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring,
and the mixed solution of the reaction was kept at 70 °C for
2 h. After that, the precipitate was cooled to room temperature, then
rinsed with anhydrous ethanol and deionized water many times, and
dried at 60 °C. The sample was further calcined at 200 °C
for 3 h in N2 and the heating rate of 2 °C/min to
obtain CoMoS4 nanoparticles.

Preparation of Porous Carbon
The porous carbon was
prepared by carbonizing the precursor of FCS. First, the dried FCS
was pre-carbonized at 300 °C for 3 h in a chamber furnace under
air atmosphere. Second, 3 g of both FCSs and KOH were mixed into a
beaker with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 2 h, and next,
the product was dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Third, under N2 flow of 60 mL min–1 at 700 °C for 2 h and
the heating rate of 2 °C/min, the product was activated from
the second step and then was cooled to indoor temperature automatically.
Finally, the samples were rinsed with deionized water and 1 mol/L
HCl many times until the pH = 7 and dried at 80 °C for 12 h in
vacuum to obtain FCS.

Characterization of Materials
The
CoMoS4 nanoparticles were determined by power X-ray diffraction
measurements
(XRD, Rigaku, D/Max 2400, Japan). The element content and uniform
distribution of CoMoS4 nanoparticles were investigated
EDS. TEM (JEOL, JEM-2010, Japan) analyzed the microstructure of CoMoS4 nanoparticles. Furthermore, the element components of CoMoS4 nanoparticles were assessed by XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi). The microscopic
morphology and structure were observed by SEM (JEOL, JSM-6701F, Japan).

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrodes of CoMoS4 and the FCS preparation process are as follows: active material
(CoMoS4 or FCS) (80 wt %), conductive agent (acetylene
black) (10 wt %), and the binder (poly vinylidene fluoride) (10 wt
%) were mixed in N-methyl pyrrolidone to form a slurry,
and the slurry was coated uniformly on the clean copper/aluminum foil
collector (copper foils and aluminum foils correspond to the CoMoS4 anodes and the FCS cathodes, respectively). Then, the electrode
was dried in a drying cabinet at 60 °C for 8 h and then was transferred
to a vacuum drying chamber at 60 °C for 12 h. The mass loading
of CoMoS4 and FCS coated each circular electrode, which
was cut into 14 mm diameter range from 0.6 to 1.4 mg. The lithium
metal piece was regarded as reference electrode and counter electrode;
the electrolyte composed of 1 mol LiPF6 in EC/EMC/DMC mixture
(1:1:1 v/v/v) and Celgard 2400 as the separator. The cell was done
in a glovebox which was full of argon (Ar). Moreover, the oxygen content
of the glovebox was less than 1 ppm, and the moisture content was
less-than 0.1 ppm. The hybrid LIC was tested the same as the half
cells. The cycling measurements and the galvanostatic discharge–charge
performance were tested by the Land testing system (CT-2001A). CV
characteristics of LIC cell and half-cell were measured by using the
Electrochemical Workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai, China). The potential
range of half cells was between 0.01 and 3.00 V, and the hybrid LIC
was conducted with the voltage window 0–3 V.
