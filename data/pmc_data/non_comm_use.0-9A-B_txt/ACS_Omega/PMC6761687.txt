The
development of efficient, stable, and economic water oxidation
catalysts (WOCs) is a forefront topic of sustainable energy research.
We newly present a comprehensive three-step approach to systematically
investigate challenging relationships among preparative history, properties,
and performance in heterogeneous WOCs. To this end, we studied (1)
the influence of the preparative method on the material properties
and (2) their correlation with the performance as (3) a function of
the catalytic test method. Spinel-type Co3O4 was selected as a clear-cut model WOC and synthesized via nine different
preparative routes. In search of the key material properties for high
catalytic performance, these cobalt oxide samples were characterized
with a wide range of analytical methods, including X-ray absorption
spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction,
Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area analysis, and transmission electron
microscopy. Next, the corresponding catalytic water oxidation activities
were assessed with the three most widely applied protocols to date,
namely, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and chemical oxidation.
The activity of the Co3O4 samples was found
to clearly depend on the applied test method. Increasing surface area
and disorder as well as a decrease in oxidation states arising from
low synthesis temperatures were identified as key parameters for high
chemical oxidation activity. Surprisingly, no obvious property–performance
correlations were found for photocatalytic water oxidation. In sharp
contrast, all samples showed similar activity in electrochemical water
oxidation. The substantial performance differences between the applied
protocols demonstrate that control and comprehensive understanding
of the preparative history are crucial for establishing reliable structure–performance
relationships in WOC design.

Introduction
Efficient water splitting,
also referred to as artificial photosynthesis,
provides direct access to storable and renewable fuels.1−5 The complex four-electron transfer of the water oxidation half reaction
remains a major bottleneck for designing high-performance water splitting
systems.6 Therefore, the development of
stable, economic, and efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is
essential for water splitting technologies.7,8

However, the quest for optimal WOCs remains largely empirical due
to fundamental open questions in solid-state synthesis. First, the
predictivity of inorganic synthetic protocols is still limited, especially
with respect to understanding the precise influence of diverse synthetic
methods and conditions on crucial material parameters.9−13 Consequently, establishing predictive preparation–properties–performance
relations for WOCs remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, recent
results indicate that the key parameters required for optimal WOC
performance can vary significantly with the applied catalytic test
method.14−16 Few systematic studies to date shed light on the
understanding of preparative history as an essential foundation for
catalyst production, which is indispensable for true material tailoring
and any large-scale production processes. In the long term, screening
such wide parameter spaces may only be possible with new, tailored
machine learning approaches.17,18

We here introduce
a new, comprehensive strategy to investigate
the complex interplay of preparation, emerging properties, and assay-dependent
performance for Co3O4 as a straightforward,
binary WOC model system.

In the ongoing search for abundant,
low-cost, and robust alternatives
to noble metals,16,7 spinel-type Co3O4 keeps attracting attention.19−21 Furthermore, Co3O4 is investigated for a wide range of other applications,
for example, in battery electrodes,22−24 sensors,25 data storage,26 as
well as in general heterogeneous catalysis.27,28 Therefore, considerable attempts have been made to improve the oxygen
evolution reaction (OER) performance of pristine Co3O4, which is limited by conductivity and the number of exposed
surface active sites.29 To this end, various
specific properties were addressed, such as crystallinity,30,31 oxidation states,32,33 particle/crystallite size,34,35 defects,36 crystal structure,37−40 surface area,41 and morphology.42,43,29 Defects in particular can exert
a great influence on the interaction between the reactants and the
catalyst surface.44−48 While oxygen defects in Co3O4 created a higher
amount of active Co(II) surface species, cobalt deficiencies were
found to enhance the surface wettability.44,45 Furthermore, the productive influence of edge dislocation defects
on the electrochemical performance of Co3O4 was
newly explored.49 Additionally, a wide
range of different synthetic methods was applied on Co3O4 in the course of individual studies, including molten
salt (MS),50 ball milling (BM),51 sol–gel (SG),52 thermal decomposition (TD),53,54 precipitation,55 and classic/microwave hydrothermal (MW) synthesis.56,57,21

Generally, deriving clear
preparation–performance trends
from comparisons between different studies remains difficult due to
the underlying variations in the obtained material properties.58−60 To the best of our knowledge, the impact of the manifold preparative
options on the catalytic efficiency of Co3O4 in different test methods has not been evaluated coherently to date.
The three most common routine tests are (1) photochemical oxidation
with the well-established [Ru(bpy)3]2+/S2O82–/visible-light assay, (2)
chemical oxidation, typically performed with ceric ammonium nitrate
(CAN), and (3) electrochemical methods.15,61−63 More emphasis in electrochemical catalysis was hitherto placed on
identifying the true active species for Co-oxide-assisted water oxidation.64−67 Recently, two in situ studies revealed that the observed process
was in fact reversible and associated with the formation of a cobalt
oxyhydroxide layer during electrocatalysis.31,32,67

Notwithstanding, critical comparisons
between two or more catalytic
test assays for a given WOC remain quite rare, so that activity trends
for one assessment method were often assumed to be valid for another.
Only in 2015, a pioneering study by Stahl et al.14 first critically evaluated the influence of the employed
oxidation method on the activity of different manganese oxide WOCs
and demonstrated that the “best catalyst” indeed depends
on the applied oxidation method. Furthermore, Ding et al.68,69 found a related dependence on the applied protocol for iron-based
oxides doped with different elements and iron-based polyoxometalates.
These results on select systems demonstrate the general necessity
for further studies into the complex parameter space of catalyst preparation,
properties, and test protocols.

We here pave new ways to assess
WOCs unambiguously with a systematic
three-step methodology that stands out through screening a wide synthetic
parameter space for emerging properties–performance relations.
Co3O4 as a model WOC was (1) accessed with a
wide spectrum of synthetic methods. (2) The influence of these preparative
routes on the WOC activity was specifically assessed with the three
most established catalytic test methods. (3) The emerging properties–performance
trends were then substantiated with thorough syncharacterizations
of the different Co3O4 materials with a wide
analytical repertoire, including surface analyses, diffraction, spectroscopy,
and microscopy techniques. This strategy brought forward new correlations
between the preparative history of Co3O4 specimens
with both their resulting material properties and the catalytic performance
in different water oxidation setups.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the Different Co3O4 Materials
The
synthesized cobalt oxides were labeled according to the applied synthesis
method:
microwave hydrothermal (MW), hydrothermal (HT), precipitation method
(PM), sol–gel (SG), molten salt (MS), ball milling (BM), and
thermal decomposition (TD). Further information on the specific synthetic
protocols is provided in the Experimental Section
and Methods.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) Surface Area Characterizations
Representative TEM images
of Co3O4 samples emerging from the nine different
synthetic protocols are shown in Figure 1. The synthetic methods exerted a clear influence
on the resulting morphologies. The spinel cobalt oxides prepared by
(microwave) hydrothermal synthesis (Figure 1a,b,d) and by the precipitation method (Figure 1e) show agglomerated
nanoparticles in a size range 5–15 and 25 nm, respectively.
The Co3O4 samples synthesized by a different
hydrothermal procedure or by ball milling and thermal decomposition
(Figure 1c,h,i) partially
consist of elongated nanoparticles with an average size distribution
around 50 nm. The particles shown in Figure 1f,g were prepared by sol–gel and molten
salt methods, respectively, and they exhibit significantly larger
particle sizes of more than 300 nm.

Figure 1 TEM images of representative Co3O4 samples
prepared by different synthesis methods: (a) MW-A, (b) MW-B, (c) HT-A,
(d) HT-B, (e) PM, (f) SG, (g) MS, (h) BM, and (i) TD (scale bar =
80 nm).

Furthermore, the surface area
values of all samples were determined
from their measured N2-sorption isotherms with the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) model. The values are given in Table 1 and are in line with the TEM images, as
well as with the general trend of smaller particles showing a higher
surface area and vice versa.

a It should be noted
that the instrumental
broadening becomes the limiting factor for calculations of very narrow
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values and therefore large crystallite
domain sizes.

Powder X-ray
Diffraction (PXRD)
The powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) data in Figure 2a show the patterns for all synthesized Co3O4 samples that display the spinel-type structure throughout (space
group Fd3̅m (No.: 227)). In
the normal spinel structure, the O2– anions form
a cubic close-packed lattice, where octahedral and tetrahedral sites
are occupied by the Co3+ and Co2+ cations, respectively.70 Although all Bragg reflections are in agreement
with the given reference (PDF Card No.: 01-080-1544), the full width
at half-maximum (FWHM) is different for all synthesized cobalt oxides.
As the crystallite domain size τXRD correlates with
the FWHM, the Scherrer equation71 was used
to calculate τXRD as shown in Figure 2b and Table 1.70 As expected, the cobalt
oxides synthesized at higher temperatures (≥400 °C), namely,
SG, MS, BM, and TD, display a high crystallite domain size from ≈91
nm (SG) and up to ≈141 nm (MS). The cobalt oxide samples obtained
at lower temperatures (≤180 °C), that is, MW-A, MW-B,
HT-B, and PM, show a much lower crystallite domain size with values
below ≈25 nm (PM) and down to ≈7 nm (MW-A). HT-A is
the only exception to this trend with a higher τXRD of ≈96 nm.

by different methods. (b) Calculated crystallite domain size τXRD at FWHM. (c) Raman spectra of the synthesized spinel cobalt
oxides.

Raman Spectroscopy and
PXRD Characterization
The Raman
spectra of all synthesized cobalt oxides are shown in Figure 2c. The group theory predicts
five Raman-active vibrational modes for Co3O4, consisting of A1g, Eg, and three F2g modes.72 These five main phonon excitations
were observed for all spectra and match well with theoretical and
experimental reports on spinel-type cobalt oxide.73,74 The symmetric Co3+–O stretching vibration of octahedrally
coordinated CoO6 is attributed to A1g in 7Oh symmetry and is assigned to
the most intense band at ≈690 cm–1. The medium-/low-intensity
bands at ≈620, ≈520, and ≈480 cm–1 correspond to 1F2g, 2F2g, and Eg symmetry. The band at ≈190 cm–1 arises from tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+O4 units with 3F2g symmetry. These results further
confirm the formation of phase-pure cubic spinel Co3O4 from all applied synthesis methods.

Generally, narrow
and intense Raman-active modes are indicative of well-ordered structures.
In the present system, the oxides emerging from low-temperature methods
(MW-A, MW-B, HT-B, PM) exhibit Raman peaks shifted toward higher-frequency
values. They display lower intensity and peak broadening (Table S1) when compared with the oxide samples
obtained at higher temperatures (SG, MS, BM, TD). This trend indicates
a decrease in the long-range order of oxides synthesized at low temperatures
(MW-A, MW-B, HT-B, PM). Likewise, their PXRD patterns display low
intensities and peak broadening (MW-A, MW-B, HT-B, P, Figure 2a).75 Among them, the pattern of Co3O4-HT-B shows
tremendous peak broadening. This can be explained by the smaller particle
size and increased disorder as described below.

The observed
variations in the Raman symmetry and PXRD patterns
further suggest that the tetrahedral and octahedral coordination environments
in the different Co3O4 specimens depend on the
applied synthetic methods. The irregular cation distribution induces
lattice distortions and residual stress in the spinel structure, which
could result from the formation of oxygen or cobalt vacancies and
weaken the average Co–O bond strength.76

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)
To acquire deeper
insights into the atomic short-range order of the as-synthesized cobalt
oxides, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended
X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses were carried out. Figure 3 shows the fitting
of the Fourier-transform (FT)|k3χ(k)| spectra of the experimental Co K edge EXAFS spectra k3χ(k), for oxides displaying
remarkable differences in their short-range order, that is, Co3O4-SG, -MS, -PM, -MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B. The Co3O4-BM, -TD, and -HT-A oxides show a short-range
order similar to that of Co3O4-PM, and the fitting
results of their FT|k3χ(k)| spectra are presented in Figure S2. Calculated main values for interatomic distances, atomic
coordination numbers (N), and Debye–Waller
factors (σ2) are given in Table S2.

Figure 3 Fitting (colored spectra) of the Fourier-transform FT|k3χ(k)| of the experimental Co K edge EXAFS spectra k3χ(k) (gray) of Co3O4-SG, -MS, -PM, -MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B, phase uncorrected.
The background two-dimensional contour plots are the wavelet-transform
(WT) of the k3χ(k) spectra, and their shaded regions highlight the decrease of the
peak intensity associated with the increasing disorder parameter σ2 for Co–O, CoOcta–CoOcta, CoTetra–CoOcta, and higher Co–Co(−O)
coordination shells.

All synthesized Co3O4 samples show four prominent
peaks arising from backscattering of neighboring O and Co atoms. The
first peak in the FT|k3χ(k)| spectra at r ≈ 1.55 Å relates
to Co2+ and Co3+ cations in tetrahedral {CoO4} and octahedral {CoO6} coordination with oxygen
atoms at interatomic distances of ≈1.914 and ≈1.899
Å, respectively. However, since those two shells are too close
to be resolved in the FT|k3χ(k)| spectra, they convolute to a first Co–O shell
with a main interatomic distance Co–O ≈ 1.907 Å
and an averaged atomic coordination number N = 5.333.
The second and third peaks in the FT|k3χ(k)| spectra, at r ≈
2.49 and 2.95 Å, correspond to the CoOcta–CoOcta ≈ 2.86 Å [N = 4] and CoTetra–CoOcta ≈ 3.35 Å [N = 8] coordination shells. The fourth peak at r ≈ 4.70 Å relates to higher Co and O coordination shells
(Figure 3 and Table S2). Remarkably, while the relative amplitude
of the first Co–O coordination shell in the FT|k3χ(k)| and wavelet-transform (WT)
spectra (r ≈ 1.55 Å) does not change
much among the different Co3O4 oxides, the FT|k3χ(k)| and WT spectra
show a decreasing relative magnitude of the CoOcta–CoOcta, CoTetra–CoOcta and higher
Co–Co(−O) coordination peaks from high- to low-temperature
synthesis methods in the order Co3O4-SG >
-MS
> -PM > -MW-A > -MW-B > -HT-B (Figure 3).

The amplitude decay in the FT|k3χ(k)| and WT spectra
is correlated with a decrease of the
coordination number or an increase in the mean-square disorder parameter
σ2 = σthermal2 + σstatic2, that is, Debye–Waller factors.
Here, structural disorder arises from static disorder σstatic2, that is,
crystal defects due to slightly different interatomic distances in
the same coordination shell. The vibrational disorder σthermal2 is not crucial
since the spectra have been all measured at the same temperature.
Hence, the decline in the relative amplitude of high coordination
peaks in the FT|k3χ(k)| and WT spectra provides a direct indication of the extent of crystalline
long-range order around the cobalt centers. The results in Figure 3 and Table S2 suggest the existence of static disorder
and the presence of Co and O vacancies in the structure of the cobalt
oxides synthesized at low temperature, namely, Co3O4-HT-B, -MW-B, -MW-A, and -PM. While the atomic coordination
number N for CoOcta–CoOcta, CoTetra–CoOcta, and higher Co–Co(−O)
coordination shells remains quite the same for Co3O4-SG, -MS, -PM, -BM, -TD, and -HT-A, the mean-square disorder
σ2 of those oxides increases steadily (Figures S1, S2, and Table S2). The static local
disorder σ2 increases most notably for Co3O4-MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B. Additionally, for those oxide
materials, the atomic coordination number N of the
Co–O, CoOcta–CoOcta, CoTetra–CoOcta, and higher Co–Co(−O) coordination
shells is slightly smaller than the corresponding values of the more
crystalline samples Co3O4-SG, -MS, and -PM.
The Co–O bond length of ≈1.912 Å in Co3O4-MW-A is slightly larger with respect to the other oxides,
suggesting lattice expansion and relaxation of Co–O bonds.
These findings agree with results from PXRD and Raman spectra, in
which Co3O4-MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B show lower
intensity and broadened diffraction and Raman peaks due to the local
structural dispersion of the Co and O atoms in the spinel structure
(Figure 2a,c).

Figure 4a shows
XANES spectra for as-synthesized Co3O4-SG, -MS,
-PM, -MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B and those of the reference compounds
CoIIO and LiCoIIIO2. The cobalt K
edge absorption edge is gradually shifted to higher energy from ≈7719.1
eV for Co3O4-HT-B to ≈7720.36 eV for
Co3O4-SG (Figure 4c), which suggests that the distinct Co3O4 oxides were slightly oxidized when proceeding from
low to high synthesis temperatures. The average oxidation state of
Co was estimated from the linear dependence of the Co K edge position
at the energy corresponding to a μ(E)-value
of 0.5 of the normalized XANES spectra.77 Consequently, the insets in Figures 4a and S3b show that based
on the absorption edge energy position (μ(E) ≈ 0.5) of the reference compounds CoIIO and LiCoIIIO2, the Co valence states for the synthesized
Co3O4 oxides slightly increase from ≈2.654
for Co3O4-HT-B to ≈2.778 for Co3O4-SG. The average cobalt oxidation state in an ideal
spinel is 2.67. To preserve electroneutrality, O2– vacancies can for example be balanced by two Co2+ sites
replacing two Co3+ centers, resulting in an overall decrease
of the average cobalt oxidation state. In the case of cobalt defects
(or interstitial oxygen), the missing charge of a Co2+/3+ site (or an additional O2– charge) can be balanced
by two/three Co3+ sites instead of two/three Co2+ sites, giving rise to a higher average cobalt oxidation state.44,45

Figure 4 (a)
XANES spectra of synthesized Co3O4-SG,
-MS, -PM, -MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B oxides and reference compounds CoIIO and LiCoIIIO2. The inset shows the
calculated Co valence states, (b) zoom of changes in the pre-edge
intensity of XANES spectra, and (c) zoom of the shifts of the Co K
edge absorption edge to higher energies at μ(E) = 0.5 of the normalized XANES spectra.

As shown in Figure 4b, the XANES spectra of the synthesized oxides exhibit a characteristic
pre-edge peak at about ≈7709.6 eV, whose intensity slightly
increases in the order Co3O4-MW-B > -MW-A
>
-MS > -HT-B > -PM > -SG. The pre-edge peak in XANES spectra
is more
intense for metal centers in tetrahedral symmetry and becomes broader
and less intense for metal centers in octahedral coordination.77 Hence, the results in Figure 4b suggest that the cobalt distribution over
the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, that is, the degree of inversion x, could be slightly different among the synthesized oxides.
Quantitative values of the degree of inversion x can
be obtained from EXAFS fitting by weighting the amplitude of the scattering
paths computed when the absorbing Co atom is located at the tetrahedral
or octahedral sites. A single variable x corresponding
to the degree of inversion was used as a fitting parameter multiplying
the amplitude reduction factor S02 of computed scattering paths from tetrahedral or octahedral
sites. The calculated values for the degree of inversion x for all synthesized Co3O4 spinel oxides are
given in Table S2. The values of x range from x = 0.07 ± 0.02 for Co3O4-SG to x = 0.18 ± 0.02
for Co3O4-MW-B. These values agree with earlier
reported data of inversion degrees x for spinel Co3O4 oxides.78,79 The computed low x values for Co3O4-SG, -MS, -PM, and
-HT-B suggest that those Co3O4 oxides adopt
the normal spinel structure. The slightly higher values of x for Co3O4-MW-A and MW-B could suggest
a slightly inverted spinel structure. While the energy position and
line shape of the white line intensity in the XANES spectra are sensitive
to experimental beam stability, the change in the white line intensity
and the slight shift to lower energy (Figure S3a) further indicate the presence of structural disorder and an increase
of the inversion degree x. This result also suggests
that the densities of unoccupied d-states and oxidation states of
Co atoms are indeed different among the synthesized Co3O4-SG, -MS, -PM, -MW-A, -MW-B, and -HT-B oxides. These
trends agree with those of PXRD and Raman spectra and indicate that
low-temperature synthesis of Co3O4 promotes
the formation of a charge imbalance, Co and/or O vacancies, or unsaturated
chemical bonds on the spinel surface structure.

X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS data for
Co3O4-MW-B, -HT-B, -SG, and -PM are shown in Figure 5 together with those
of the reference samples CoIIO and LiCoIIIO2 for representative core-level spectra of Co2+ and
Co3+, respectively. The binding energies of the Co 2p3/2 emission are similar for all investigated cobalt oxides
at ≈780 eV (Figure 5a), which is in good agreement with literature reports.80 Whereas the peak positions for Co2+ and Co3+ are hard to distinguish, samples containing
Co2+ show an additional characteristic shake-up satellite
emission at roughly 786 eV.81 The intensity
of this satellite emission (inset of Figure 5a) can be used to assess the relative amount
of Co2+ present in the sample. Postcatalytic analysis of
Co3O4-HT-B therefore reveals a small decrease
in the relative Co2+ amount (Figure S5). By comparing the intensity of the satellite emission of
the synthesized cobalt oxides with that of the reference compounds
LiCoIIIO2 and CoIIO, the following
trend for the average Co valence states was derived: HT-B < PM
≈ MW-B < SG. This trend is in good agreement with the XANES
data shown in Figure 4a,c. Whereas the Co 2p3/2 core-level binding energies
are similar for CoO and Co3O4, the shift in
the kinetic energy of the L3VV Auger emission is considerable for
different oxidation states. Figure 5b shows a Wagner plot featuring both Co 2p3/2 binding energies and L3VV Auger kinetic energies. The Wagner plot
is a helpful analytical tool for chemical state analysis because it
provides a comprehensive display of both Auger electron kinetic energies
and photoelectron binding energies. It can be applied for different
materials containing the same element by plotting the kinetic energies
of an Auger peak over the binding energies of a photoelectron peak.82 The sum of the Auger kinetic energies and the
binding energies, the modified Auger parameters, is illustrated as
diagonal lines.83 The Auger parameter is
insensitive to charging and particularly useful when comparing spectra
of insulating samples with results from the literature. Modified Auger
parameters from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) are given as references (Co3O4*, Co*,
and CoO*) as indicated by the orange lines.80

Figure 5 (a)
XPS spectra of the Co 2p3/2 peak of the synthesized
Co3O4-MW-B, -HT-B, -SG, and -PM samples and

plot using the Co 2p3/2 core-level binding energy and the
Co L3VV Auger electron kinetic energy. References (Co3O4*, Co*, and CoO*) were obtained from the NIST database.80

The modified Auger parameters
for the as-synthesized Co3O4-MW-B, -HT-B, and
PM samples are on the same line with
the Co3O4* reference. Interestingly, the measured
CoIIO also coincides with this line, implying oxidation
of the surface. The SG sample is closer to the LiCoIIIO2 line, which is in good agreement with the absence of a strong
satellite emission as shown in Figure 5a. These findings correlate well with the previous
spectroscopic measurements, showing the same trends, namely, lower
average oxidation states for samples synthesized at lower temperatures.

Water Oxidation Performance of Co3O4 Samples
from Different Preparative Routes
The water oxidation performance
of Co3O4 samples synthesized by nine different
methods was tested using the three most widely applied approaches,
namely, photocatalytic, chemical, and electrocatalytic oxidation.
The results are summarized in Figure 6, and for a better assessment of the activity, the
BET surface area and the mean-square disorder parameter σ2 values are included as well. A version of Figure 6 with data normalized to the
specific surface area can be found in the Supporting Information (SI)
(Figure S6).

Figure 6 Comparison of the water
oxidation activity of spinel Co3O4 synthesized
with different methods by applying photochemical,
electrochemical, and chemical oxidation methods, together with the
respective BET surface area and the mean-square disorder parameter
σ2. For the photochemical oxidation, a standard [Ru(bpy)3]2+/S2O82– protocol was used with a borate buffer (pH 8.5). Electrocatalytic
activity is compared by the potentials vs reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) at 1 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH, and chemical oxidation was
tested in 146 mM cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN).

Photocatalytic Water Oxidation
For photocatalytic water
oxidation, a standard [Ru(bpy)3]2+/S2O82–/light assay was used at pH 8.5.
In this case, through visible-light excitation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ and subsequent oxidative quenching by persulfate,
the one-electron oxidant [Ru(bpy)3]3+ is generated
in situ [E° = 1.26 V vs normal hydrogen electrode
(NHE)].84Figure 6 shows a quite significant difference in
activity. The samples synthesized at lower temperatures generally
show higher OER activity, with the hydrothermally synthesized Co3O4-HT-B demonstrating the highest activity with
an O2 yield of 77.7 ± 6.4% at 203 m2/g,
compared with the samples obtained at high temperatures where the
least active catalyst is Co3O4-MS with 12.4
± 0.4% at a surface area of only 2 m2/g. This goes
hand in hand with the observed high surface areas of MW-A (99 m2/g), MW-B (146 m2/g), and HT-B (203 m2/g). However, HT-A and PM, which exhibit relatively low surface areas,
also show higher performance than most of the samples. Among the high-temperature
samples, Co3O4-MS, -BM, and -SG show a trend
toward higher activity upon increasing surface area. Co3O4-TD is again an exception with a rather high activity
of 46.9 ± 4.6% for its comparably low surface area of 11 m2/g. Note that the disorder among the samples follows a related
trend related to the surface area. No clear correlation between the
activity and either of the parameters surface area, disorder, or valence
state can be seen in photocatalytic water oxidation. The general photocatalytic
performance trend reveals a higher activity for materials synthesized
through low-temperature hydrothermal or precipitation methods (≤180
°C) than for materials synthesized at high temperatures (≥400
°C) (Co3O4-TD being the above-mentioned
exception). Consequently, the selected synthetic method exerts a clear
effect on photocatalytic water oxidation activity.

Electrocatalytic
Performance
Electrochemical measurements
were performed in a three-electrode setup, using
Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and Pt as the counter electrode.
Ag/AgCl is still widely applied as the reference electrode for measurements
in basic media (for example, 1 M KOH), when keeping in mind that minor
stability issues can occur due to silver oxide formation in basic
conditions. We performed control experiments using a Ag/AgCl reference
electrode to ensure that such effects did not affect the required
accuracy of our measurements.85−87 Considering the recently shown
instability of Pt under certain conditions, this occurs mainly in
acidic environments and affects the water reduction half reaction
rather than the oxygen evolution process. Further discussions can
be found in the SI and in Figure S10a.88−92 To evaluate the electrocatalytic water oxidation performance, the
spinel samples were coated on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO), and
cyclic voltammetry as well as chronoamperometry was performed, first
stepwise from 0.45 to 0.65 V versus Ag/AgCl and then for 2 h at 0.6
V. The electrodes were investigated before and after these measurements
with scanning electron microscopy imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and
PXRD (Figures S8–S10). All of these
characterizations did not show notable changes of the electrodes.
Only in the PXRD patterns did the postcatalytic samples show increased
intensity of the FTO peaks, which is most likely due to partial detachment
of the catalyst from the electrode, but not arising from intrinsic
changes of the catalyst itself. No clear trend is apparent from the
cyclic voltammograms, where all samples showed an onset potential
in the range of 1.49–1.64 V versus RHE with significant standard
deviations of 0.03 V (see Figure S8). The
only remarkable feature is that Co3O4-MS, with
an overpotential of 1.64 V versus RHE, is outperformed clearly by
all other materials. For a better internal comparison of the obtained
materials, stepwise chronoamperometry was conducted to eliminate the
diffusion current, therefore representing the catalytic activity more
reliably. The potentials at 1 mA/cm2 are determined from Figure S11 and compared in Figure 6. Other than in photocatalytic tests, even
from these more accurate measurements, no clear influence on the electrocatalytic
performance is evident. All potentials at 1 mA/cm2 are
in the range of 1.57–1.62 V versus RHE with a comparatively
large error of 0.024 V. This indicates that the differences among
the materials, such as in surface area, disorder, or oxidation state,
are less important for electrocatalytic water oxidation, that is,
the influence of the synthetic method is rather negligible here. As
the postcatalytic investigations still show the presence of Co3O4 (see SI, pre- and
postcatalytic analyses), the observed leveling may point to a reversible
precatalytic formation of a thin shell of CoOx(OH)y, in line with the in situ XRD/XAS
study of Dau and Strasser et al. describing the reversible formation
of a catalytically active sub-nanometer CoOx(OH)y layer containing di-μ-oxo-bridged
Co3+/4+ ions.31 A related in
situ study by Chen et al. on Co3O4@CoO nanocubes
supported the intermediate formation of active α- and β-CoOOH
thin layers.93 In light of these findings,
pristine surface compositions and structures of such oxides would
indeed be relativized to a large extent in electrochemical tests.

Chemical Oxidation Performance
Chemical water oxidation
was tested with the strong one-electron oxidant cerium(IV) ammonium
nitrate (CAN) with an E° of 1.7 V versus NHE.94,95 CAN-assisted oxidation is a relatively simple and straightforward
protocol for WOC assessment since the kinetics are driven in one-electron
steps and commercially available O2 sensors can be used.
However, CAN is only sufficiently stable at low pH values of typically
0.9, which limits its applicability.96 Even
though chemical and photochemical water oxidation tests are thus performed
at very different pH values, their “overpotentials”
for water oxidation correspond to comparable E°
at the given pH values.14 In our case,
water oxidation was tested with a standard method, measuring O2 production by a luminescent dissolved oxygen (LDO) electrode
with results between 5 × 10–4 and 10–2 mmol oxygen/mg catalyst. Co3O4-HT-B was the
most active catalyst (1.05 × 10–2 mmol oxygen/mg),
and Co3O4-MS showed the lowest activity (6.45
× 10–4 mmol oxygen/mg, see Figure 6), as observed for photocatalytic
oxidation. Despite this similarity and the comparable “overpotentials”,
the activities of the other cobalt oxides vary drastically between
both test methods. In contrast to the photochemical oxidation, the
activities for the chemical oxidation display the expected correlations
with the material parameters. The activity increases clearly with
the BET surface area. Likewise, the increasing disorder among the
sample series results in continuously higher activity. As BET surface
area and disorder show similar trends, both being linked to the preparative
history, a reasonable further narrowing to one key performance parameter
is not possible within the present data set. Additionally, the lower
general oxidation states derived from XANES and XPS data, indicating
excess Co2+ associated with oxygen vacancies, could be
a key performance parameter. Generally, samples synthesized at lower
temperatures show higher activities than the high-temperature samples,
such as Co3O4-MS, -BM, and -SG (Figure 6).

Trends in WOC Assessment
All in all, quite different
performance trends were observed for Co3O4 WOCs
when investigated with all three catalytic methods. This agrees with
the first fundamental investigation along these lines by Stahl et
al.14 comparing different manganese oxide
types for photocatalytic, chemical, and electrocatalytic water oxidation
as well as with subsequent studies of Ding et al.68 on doped iron-based oxides. The present study newly demonstrates
that even the catalytic activity of a single material type can differ
widely between test methods when it undergoes different preparative
histories. While Antonietti and Driess et al.41 tailored the particle size of cobalt oxides with related synthetic
methods and found the efficiency of photo- and electrocatalytic water
oxidation of Co3O4 nanoparticles to depend on
the available surface area, our previous studies on Co3O4 hydrothermal growth mechanisms indicated that the surface
area is not by all means the decisive performance parameter.13

While photochemical and chemical oxidation
are both molecular processes, they were found to respond differently
to the involved material parameters, that is, the preparative method
exerts a clear influence on the WOC activity. Surface area, oxidation
state, and disorder were identified as the most important parameters
for the chemical oxidation performance. In contrast, no such trend
for these parameters could be found for the photochemical oxidation.
However, in both test methods, Co3O4 samples
synthesized at higher temperatures generally show lower activity than
those obtained at notably lower synthesis temperatures. As for electrochemical
water oxidation, no parameter dependence with respect to surface area,
particle size, disorder, etc. emerged, so that the choice of the synthesis
method exerted a negligible effect on the electrocatalytic performance.

Conclusions
In this work, a comprehensive three-step
strategy using spinel-type
Co3O4 water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) as a
model system was newly applied to investigate the complex parameter
space of preparative history, material properties, and the resulting
performance as a function of the applied catalytic driving force.
To this end, nine different synthetic approaches to Co3O4 were first performed, covering a wide spectrum of low-
and high-temperature methods. Next, key physical and surface properties
of the as-synthesized products were compared, such as oxidation states,
crystallinity, disorder, and particle size. Finally, this spectrum
of cobalt oxide materials was compared with respect to their WOC activities
in the three most widely applied test methods, namely, photocatalytic,
electrocatalytic, and chemical water oxidation.

The Co3O4 samples synthesized at lower temperatures
show higher disorder, as determined from EXAFS fitting and in line
with Raman spectroscopy results. These more disordered samples also
contain lower fractions of Co(III) than those exhibiting a higher
degree of crystallinity, as evident from XPS and XANES data. Generally,
cobalt oxides synthesized at low temperatures (≤180 °C)
show higher water oxidation activities in chemical and photocatalytic
tests than those obtained at higher temperatures. Chemical oxidation
with CAN brought forward the clearest correlation between increasing
catalytic activity and higher surface area/disorder along with lower
average cobalt oxidation states. In contrast, the electrochemical
water oxidation activity is quite insensitive to variations in the
material properties. Surprisingly, no clear photocatalytic activity
trends were observed for the Co3O4 sample spectrum.

All in all, we demonstrate that the preparative history exerts
a crucial influence on the material properties of Co3O4 WOCs. These distinct synthesis-dependent properties give
rise to significant activity differences in chemical and photochemical
assays. Our systematic study shows that acquiring comprehensive synthetic
insight is a fundamental prerequisite for any further properties–performance
relationships. We here show their striking complexity for an apparently
straightforward binary oxide system. In the long term, control over
the entire parameter space of preparation, properties, and performance
will require machine learning approaches to expedite the optimization
of a wide spectrum of catalytic and other functional materials.

Experimental
Section and Methods
Synthetic Procedures
Hydrothermal Synthesis
(HT-A)
For the hydrothermal
synthesis of Co3O4,56 0.24 g of urea (4 mmol) and 0.233 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.82 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of H2O2 (30 wt %) solution under vigorous stirring.
The homogeneous reaction solution was transferred to a 15 mL poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE)-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 150 °C (4.5
C°/min). The holding temperature was maintained for 3 h. The
autoclaves were cooled down rapidly under cold running water (10 °C)
for 8 min. The black precipitate was purified by centrifugation/resuspension
(5000 rpm, 8 min, 2 × H2O and 2 × EtOH) and dried
at 78 °C for 16 h in air.

Alternative Hydrothermal
Synthesis (HT-B)
The alternative
hydrothermal synthesis was carried out according to the following
procedure:97 291 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol) and 42.5 mg of NaNO3 (0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL of H2O. After
10 min of stirring, 15 mL of NH3 (25%) solution was slowly
added, and after 10 more minutes of stirring, 1.5 mL of H2O2 (30 wt%) solution was added. The reaction solution
was transferred to a 15 mL PTFE-lined stainless steel autoclave and
heated to 140 °C (4.5 C°/min). The holding temperature was
maintained for 6 h and then cooled to room temperature naturally.
The black precipitate was purified by centrifugation/resuspension
(5000 rpm, 8 min, 2 × H2O and 2 × EtOH) and dried
at 78 °C for 16 h in air.

Microwave Hydrothermal
Synthesis (MW-A)
For the microwave
hydrothermal synthesis of Co3O4, 1.8 mmol of
Co(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved
in 15 mL of H2O and the pH was adjusted to 11 with NH3 (25%) solution. The resulting dispersion was filled into
a 50 mL Teflon liner, which was closed and fixed inside a frame before
introducing into the microwave. Reactions were carried out in a MARS5
microwave (CEM Corporation). The synthesis was conducted by controlling
the temperature: 30 min ramping to 180 °C and then holding this
temperature for 60 min under constant stirring. The temperature and
pressure were measured from the reference vessel, which was equipped
with appropriate sensors. After letting the dispersions cool down
to room temperature, the product was separated by centrifugation and
washed with H2O.

Microwave Alternative Hydrothermal
Synthesis (MW-B)
First, 100 mM Co(NO3)2·6H2O
and 50 mM NaNO3 were dissolved in 5 mL of H2O. Then, 5 mL of NH3 (25%) solution and 0.5 mL of H2O2 (32 wt %) were added before sealing the solution
in the corresponding vessels as described in the above section. The
reaction was carried out at 140 °C for 1 h after 30 min of ramping
time.

Mild Oxidative Synthesis/Precipitation Method (PM)
The nitrate-salt-mediated precipitation method was carried out according
to a previously reported procedure.55 NaNO3 (15 g, 176 mmol) was added to a 50 mL two-necked round-bottom
flask, equipped with a water-cooled reflux condenser containing 25
mL of NaOH solution (0.3 M). The reaction mixture was heated to 95
°C, and an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 (5.0 mL, 1.0 M) was added within 1 min, which led to instantaneous
precipitation. Throughout the precipitation and aging period, the
reaction mixture was stirred vigorously and purged with air while
keeping the temperature constant at 95 °C for 16 h. Afterward,
the suspension was cooled to room temperature naturally under ambient
conditions. The black precipitate was purified by centrifugation/resuspension
(5000 rpm, 8 min, 2 × HCl (2 M), 1 × H2O and
1 × EtOH) and dried at 78 °C for 16 h in air.

Thermal Decomposition
(TD)
For the synthesis of Co3O4 through
thermal decomposition, Co(NO3)2·6H2O was added to a crucible, heated
in a muffle furnace to 450 °C (4.5 °C/min), and kept at
this temperature for 3 h. Afterward, the product was cooled to room
temperature naturally.

Ball Milling (BM) and Thermal Decomposition
Co(NO3)2·6H2O was ground
in a planetary
ball mill (Retsch) at a speed of 500 rpm for 2 h. The ball-milled
powder was calcined in air at 450 °C for 1 h to obtain larger
Co3O4 nanoparticles.

Sol–Gel (SG)
A variation of the sol–gel
method from ref (98) was applied: 1.8 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 2.7 mmol citric acid were dissolved in 25 mL of H2O. The solution was heated up slowly while stirring until
a gel was formed. It was heated up to 400 °C for 1 h, transferred
into a ceramic crucible, and then heated again to 700 °C for
10 h, yielding Co3O4.

Molten Salt (MS) Method
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.291 g, 1
mmol) was mixed with LiNO3 (6.895 g, 100 mmol), ground,
and transferred to an alumina crucible.
The crucible was put into a muffle furnace, heated to 400 °C
(12.6 °C/min), and kept at this temperature for 30 min. Afterward,
the mixture cooled down to room temperature naturally and was washed
(2 × H2O and 1 × EtOH) and dried at 78 °C
for 16 h in air.50

Catalytic Measurements
Photocatalytic
Tests
Photocatalytic water oxidation
tests were performed using a standard [Ru(bpy)3]2+/S2O82– protocol.13 Photocatalytic reaction suspensions were handled
in a dark environment while being shielded from light. According to
the protocol, Co3O4 photocatalyst (2.00 mg,
8.3 mmol), Na2S2O8 sacrificial electron
acceptor (9.5 mg, 5 mM), and [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O photosensitizer (6.0 mg, 1 mM) were mixed with borate buffer
(8 mL, 80 mM, pH 8.5) in a 10 mL headspace glass vial. The glass vial
was subsequently sealed gastight with a rubber septum (PTFE) and an
aluminum crimp cap and sonicated for 3 min. To remove all of the oxygen
before starting the test, the suspension was degassed through purging
with helium (purity 5.0) for 10 min. Afterward, the catalytic suspension
was illuminated with a 460 nm high flux light-emitting diode light
(26.1 mW/cm, Rhopoint Components Ltd.) under constant stirring (1200
rpm) for 25 min. For evaluating the amount of evolved oxygen, a 100
μL gas sample was taken from the headspace with a gastight microliter
syringe (Hamilton-1825RN) and injected into the gas chromatograph
(GC). A previously determined linear GC calibration curve was used
to quantify the oxygen evolution (air contamination was corrected).
The error of O2 yield was determined by the standard deviation
of minimum three photocatalytic tests for each sample.

Chemical
Water Oxidation
The standard CAN method was
used to evaluate the chemical water oxidation activity of the catalysts.15 With a standard potential of about 1.7 V versus
NHE, CAN is a suitable one-electron oxidant to promote the water oxidation.
CAN (2 g) was dissolved in Milli-Q water (40 mL), and the solution
was degassed with argon. The respective catalysts (2 mg each) were
added, and the oxygen evolution was recorded by a luminescent dissolved
oxygen (LDO) sensor in the stirred solution for about 45 min. The
highest obtained value was used for the evaluation. A Hach HQ40D multimeter
with an LDO 101 sensor was used for oxygen determination.

Electrocatalytic
Tests
Electrocatalytic measurements
were carried out in 1 M KOH, using a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and
a Pt counter electrode. First, cyclic voltammetry cycles from 0 to
0.7 V versus reference with 0.005 mV step size were measured, prior
to conducting chronoamperometry. For comparison, only the second cycle
was considered upon data evaluation. The potential was stepwise increased
starting from 0.45 to 0.65 V in 0.01 V steps and held for 5 min each
to eliminate diffusion currents. The stabilized current after 5 min
was used for further evaluation. After the steps, a potential of 0.6
V versus the reference electrode was applied for 2 h for stability
tests. Electrochemical measurements were carried out with a Bio-Logic
SAS SP-150 Potentiostat. As the reference electrode, an Aldrich glass
reference electrode Ag/AgCl with 3 M KCl and as the counter electrode,
a Pt foil were used. The working electrodes were produced by dispersing
2 mg of the catalyst in 100 μL of H2O, applying 40
μL of this dispersion on 1 cm2 FTO, and drying the
electrodes at 80 °C for 30 min before covering with 10 μL
of Nafion 1% solution.

Materials and Methods
Ultrapure
H2O (18.2
MΩ) was generally used for synthesis (Merck, Milli-Q Type 1
Ultrapure Water Systems). All chemicals and solvents were purchased
from commercial suppliers: CoO (Aldrich, ≥99.99% metals basis),
LiCoO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.5% metals basis), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999% trace
metal basis), [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95%), Na2S2O8 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0%), H2O2 30 wt % in H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS Reagent), urea (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%),
NaNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.0%), NaOH (Acros Organics,
97+%), LiNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus), ammonia solution
25% (Merck, for analysis), ethanol (VWR Chemicals, absolute), citric
acid (Merck, anhydrous for synthesis), KOH (Honeywell, pellets, extra
pure), HCl (Fluka Analytical), Nafion perfluorinated resin solution
5 wt % in a mixture of lower aliphatic alcohols, and water (Sigma-Aldrich).

Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were recorded with a STOE
STADI P diffractometer in the transmission mode (flat-plate sample
holder, Ge monochromator, and Mo Kα1 radiation) using
a position-sensitive microstrip solid-state detector (MYTHEN 1K).
Raman spectroscopy was performed with a Renishaw inVia Qontor confocal
Raman microscope equipped with a diode laser (785 nm). Gas chromatography
(GC) measurements were recorded with Agilent Technologies 7820A equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector and a 30 m × 0.53 mm packed
HP molecular sieve column with a 50.0 μm film and He carrier
gas (purity 6.0). Nitrogen sorption isotherms were recorded with a
Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI porosimeter at 77 K after degassing at
100 °C for 20 h under vacuum. The Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) model was applied for adsorption branch points (0.05 > p/p0 < 0.3) to calculate
the apparent surface area. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images were taken with JEOL JEM-1400 Plus equipped with a JEOL CCD
camera Ruby (8 M pixel) and a LaB6 crystal as an emitter
(120 kV). X-ray absorption spectroscopy XANES and EXAFS at the Co
K edge on solid powder samples dispersed in cellulose of the synthesized
Co3O4 oxides and reference samples CoIIO, LiCoIIIO2 was carried out at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Swiss-Norwegian Beamline BM31, Grenoble-France.
The storage ring was run in the top-up mode (average current 40 mA).
The X-ray beam was collimated using a Si-coated mirror, and energy
was scanned using a double crystal Si[111] monochromator. Measurements
were performed at room temperature using a three-ionization chamber
configuration in the transmission mode using a 13-element Ge detector.
For energy calibrations, spectra of a metal Co foil were measured
simultaneously at the second ionization chamber. The measured EXAFS
spectra k3χ(k)
were extracted by data reduction, absorption edge energy calibration,
and background subtraction as implemented in ATHENA.99 The spectra were reduced in the range Δk ≈ 3–14 Å–1 and Fourier-transform
to FT|k3χ(k)| into
the real-space interval of ΔR ≈ 0–6
Å. To calculate main values for interatomic distances, coordination
numbers, and Debye–Waller factors σ2 nonlinear
least-squares fitting of the experimental FT|k3χ(k)| spectra was carried out by ARTEMIS99 using atomic clusters of Co3O4 (ICSD code 27498), generated by ATOMS99 as implemented in IFEFFIT.99 The amplitude and phase shifts for single and multiple scattering
paths were calculated using FEFF6.100 X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Physical Electronics
(PHI) Quantum 2000 spectrometer featuring monochromatic Al Kα radiation, generated from an electron beam operated at 15 kV and
35.8 W. The energy scale of the instrument was calibrated using Au
and Cu reference samples. The analysis was conducted at 1 e–8 mbar, with an electron take-off angle of 45° and a pass energy
of 23.5 eV for all samples. Charge compensation during the measurement
was achieved using a low-energy electron source. The acquired spectra
were then aligned using the main (C–C) component of the C 1s
core-level emission. The modified Auger parameter was calculated by
adding the kinetic energy of the Co L3VV and Co 2p3/2 binding
energies.
