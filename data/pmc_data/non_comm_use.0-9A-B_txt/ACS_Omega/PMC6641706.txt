Delivery systems
have been developed to address problematic properties
of drugs, but the specific release of drugs at their targets is still
a challenge. Polymers that depolymerize end-to-end in response to
the cleavage of stimuli-responsive end-caps from their termini, commonly
referred to as self-immolative polymers, offer high sensitivity to
stimuli and have potential for the development of new high-performance
delivery systems. In this work, we prepared hybrid particles composed
of varying ratios of self-immolative poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG)
and slowly degrading poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PLA).
These systems were designed to provide a dual release mechanism consisting
of a rapid burst release of drug from the PEtG domains and a slower
release from the PLA domains. Using end-caps responsive to UV light
and reducing thiols, it was found that triggered particles exhibited
partial degradation, as indicated by a reduction in their dynamic
light-scattering count rate that depended on the PEtG:PLA ratio. The
particles were also shown to release the hydrophobic dye Nile red
and the drug celecoxib in a manner that depended on triggering and
the PEtG:PLA ratio. In vitro toxicity assays showed
an effect of the stimuli on the toxicity of the celecoxib-loaded particles
but also suggested it would be ideal to replace the sodium cholate
surfactant that was used in the particle synthesis procedure in order
to reduce the background toxicity of the delivery system. Overall,
these hybrid systems show promise for tuning and controlling the release
of drugs in response to stimuli.

Introduction
The controlled release
of therapeutics using drug delivery systems
has been studied in depth over the last several decades.1−3 Drug delivery systems can provide improved solubility or dispersibility
of hydrophobic drugs, improved bioavailability, and more specific
targeting, leading to fewer adverse side effects. Polymers have been
widely explored for drug delivery, as they can be engineered to assemble
into a variety of nanostructures such as vesicles, micelles, and solid-core
particles by tuning both their chemical structures and their processing
conditions.4,5 Polymeric solid-core particles, composed
of a hydrophobic polymer core that is stabilized in aqueous solution
using a surfactant coating, are among the most widely investigated
drug delivery systems due to their ease of preparation by various
techniques such as emulsification or nanoprecipitation.6−8 A hydrophobic cargo molecule can be encapsulated within the hydrophobic
cores of the particles during their preparation.

Thus far, most
polymeric particles have been composed of biodegradable
polyesters such as poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(caprolactone),
and their copolymers.9−11 While these have been effective at improving the
delivery of therapeutics, the hydrolytic degradation of polyesters
is inherently a random process, and it is challenging to control its
rate.12 In some cases, degradation may
be more rapid than desired, while in other cases it may be too slow.
To address this limitation, stimuli-responsive particles have been
developed and shown to release drug molecules in response to stimuli
such as heat, reactive oxygen species, reducing agents, or changes
in pH.13,14

Over the past decade, a new class
of stimuli-responsive polymers
was introduced. Often termed self-immolative polymers (SIPs), these
polymers undergo complete end-to-end depolymerization in response
to stimuli-mediated cleavage of end-caps from the polymer termini.15,16 This offers the potential to amplify responses to stimuli, making
SIPs of significant interest for a wide range of applications including
sensors,17−19 responsive plastics and coatings,20−22 lithography,23 and drug delivery.18,24−28 Backbones including polycarbamates,17,24 polyaldehydes,20,23,29−34 polycarbonates,35 polythiocarbamates,36 and poly(benzyl ether)s37 have been developed, and end-caps responsive to stimuli including
light,25,26,31 thiols,26,36 acid,38 fluoride,20,21,39 heat,40,41 and H2O219,42 have been studied.

Only a few studies
thus far have explored the potential of SIPs
for drug delivery. Our group demonstrated the triggered release of
Nile red as a model drug from assemblies composed of poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) block copolymers with a polycarbamate SIP based on 4-hydroxybenzyl
alcohol and N,N-dimethylethylene
diamine.24 Almutairi and co-workers prepared
nanoparticles from the same polymer backbone capped with a UV light-responsive
end-cap and studied the release of Nile red from these particles in
response to UV and two-photon irradiation.25 Liu and co-workers reported self-immolative vesicles based on polycarbamates
composed of 4-aminobenzyl alcohol as the hydrophobic block and demonstrated
vesicle disruption and the release of payloads including fluorophores,
enzymes, and the drugs camptothecin and doxorubicin (Dox) in response
to light or reducing conditions as stimuli.26 They also prepared amphiphilic hyperbranched polycarbamate–PEG
copolymers and demonstrated the release of Dox that was covalently
bound to the polymers as well as DNA that was complexed to cationic
poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) chains conjugated to the
periphery of the hyperbranched polymer.18 Vallet-Regi, Manzano, and co-workers used polycarbamates as blocking
agents to control drug release from mesoporous silica nanoparticles.28 Despite this progress, the release of potentially
toxic quinone methides and aza-quinone methides from these systems
during their depolymerization is a possible drawback.43 To address this, we recently reported the study of micelles
based on poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG)–PEG block copolymers.27 PEtG depolymerizes to ethyl glyoxylate, which
is subsequently hydrolyzed to generate ethanol and glyoxylic acid
(Figure 1a). Glyoxylic
acid is a metabolic intermediate that can be processed in the liver
and should be nontoxic in low concentrations.44 Previous work has demonstrated the nontoxicity of PEtG degradation
products in a Caenorhabditis elegans (invertebrate)
model.45 We demonstrated that by simple
tuning of the end-cap linker molecule between the PEG and PEtG blocks
it was possible to easily change the stimulus to which the micelles
responded, and the triggered release of doxorubin and curcumin was
demonstrated.27

scheme for PEtG. (b) Chemical structures of
the stimuli-responsive and control PEtGs used in this study.

We describe here an alternative
approach for formulating drug delivery
systems using PEtG. Using an emulsion method, we prepared sodium cholate-stabilized
PEtG particles. Furthermore, in order to add an additional level of
control over the drug release, we explored particles composed of blends
of PEtG and poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PLA). It was
envisioned that triggering of PEtG degradation would result in erosion
and rapid drug release from the PEtG domains, leaving drug-loaded
PLA for a sustained drug release. 6-Nitroveratryl carbonate-capped
PEtG was selected for its rapid responsiveness to UV light and served
as an ideal model system.31 Disulfide-capped
PEtG38 was selected as a thiol-sensitive
system, as elevated concentrations of reducing agents such as glutathione
(GSH) are associated with the intracellular environment as well as
hypoxic tumor tissue.46,47 The degradation of these hybrid
particles in response to UV light and thiols was studied by dynamic
light scattering (DLS) and the release of Nile red as a probe. The
drug celecoxib was encapsulated in the hybrid particles, and its stimuli-responsive
release was explored. Initial in vitro experiments
were performed to explore the behavior of the system in cells.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization of PEtG
and PEtG–PLA
Blends
PEtGs with different end-caps (Figure 1b) were synthesized as previously reported,31,38 and the characterization data for the specific batches used here
are included in the Supporting Information. PEtG with a 6-nitroveratryl carbonate end-cap (PEtG-NVOC) was selected
because the NVOC can be easily and cleanly removed using UV light.27,31 Although UV light is not practical for most in vivo applications, this serves as a valuable model. PEtG with a disulfide
end-cap (PEtG-disulfide) was selected because it can be triggered
using reducing thiols via an initial reduction of the disulfide, followed
by cyclization of the resulting thiol to produce a cyclic thiocarbonate,
releasing uncapped PEtG.38 Increased concentrations
of the reducing agent glutathione are found in intracellular compartments
and in hypoxic tumor tissue, potentially allowing for the selective
release of drugs in these environments.48,49 A control
PEtG had a benzyl carbonate end-cap (PEtG-BnCO) that was not expected
to be specifically responsive to stimuli but contained the same carbonate
linkage to the PEtG terminus as the other polymers.31

In addition to the pure polymers, blends of PLA with
the PEtGs were also studied. Ratios of 9:1, 7:3, and 1:1 PEtG:PLA
were prepared. Lower ratios of PEtG:PLA were not explored because
it was anticipated that they would exhibit primarily nonstimuli-responsive
behavior. They were prepared by codissolving the polymers in CH2Cl2. After removing the solvent, the blends were
characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). These experiments utilized PEtG-NVOC,
which behaves very similarly to the other PEtGs in terms of its thermal
properties.38 TGA showed that in agreement
with the literature pure PLA was stable up to ∼300 °C
(Figure 2a).50 Pure PEtG with the NVOC end-cap was stable up
to 200 °C, also in agreement with the reported value.31 PEtG is less thermally stable than PLA due to
its susceptibility to depolymerize. A two-step thermal degradation
was observed for each of the three blends, and the mass fractions
lost in each step were consistent with the relative ratios of polymers
in the blends. DSC analysis showed that the two polymers were mostly
phase separated in the blends as distinct glass transition temperatures
(Tg) were observed for each of PEtG and
PLA (Figure 2b, Table S2). However, the increase in the PEtG Tg from −8 to −1 °C and simultaneous
decrease in the PLA Tg from 46 to 40 °C
as the PEtG content decreased to 50% suggested that some degree of
mixing between the two polymers also occurred.

Particle Preparation
Particles were prepared by an
emulsion–evaporation procedure. Various parameters including
the surfactant identity, surfactant and polymer concentration, and
sonication time were investigated with the aim of preparing particles
of each polymer blend composition with diameters less than 200 nm
and acceptable (<0.3) polydispersity indices (PDI), to allow potential in vivo circulation. Using PEtG–NVOC, it was found
that using sodium cholate at 5 mg/mL in H2O, PEtG at 10
mg/mL in CH2Cl2, a 10:1 ratio of H2O:CH2Cl2, and three 30 s periods of sonication
it was possible to prepare particles with Z-average
diameters ranging from 128 to 144 nm and PDIs ranging from 0.11 to
0.26 as measured by DLS (Figure 3a, Table 1). While a relatively high mass ratio of 5:1 sodium cholate:polymer
was used to stabilize the emulsion of small droplets during the preparation,
after dialysis purification of the particles it was found that the
ratio was ∼1.5:1. No significant trends were observed regarding
the effects of the PEtG:PLA ratio. TEM imaging confirmed that the
particles all had solid spherical morphologies (Figure 3b–f). The diameters observed by TEM
were smaller than those measured by DLS, which can likely be attributed
to the dried versus hydrated states of the particles in these different
analyses as well as to possible aggregation in suspension. This procedure
was also applied to blends of PEtG–disulfide and PEtG–BnCO
with PLA, and the sizes and PDIs were very similar (Figures S4–S5, Tables S3–S4). The stabilities
of the pure PEtG–NVOC and pure PEtG–disulfide particles
were also studied in mouse serum over 48 h at 37 °C. The particles
underwent a gradual increase in diameter over the course of the experiment,
suggesting some degree of interactions with proteins and possible
aggregation, but were relatively stable for the first several hours
(Figures S6–S7).

Triggered Particle Degradation
First, DLS was used
to study the degradation of the particles in response to stimuli.
The DLS count rate is proportional to both the number of scattering
particles in suspension and their mass if the attenuator of and laser
position are fixed at constant values. A decrease in either the mass
or number of particles arising from degradation would lead to a reduction
in the count rate. Keeping the attenuator fixed, the count rate was
measured initially and then at time points after introduction of the
stimuli. For the PEtG–NVOC particles, the stimulus was the
application of 2.8 mW/cm2 of light radiation for 30 min,
as we have previously found this irradiation time to be sufficient
to achieve complete end-cap cleavage for other systems at similar
concentration.27,31 For PEtG–disulfide particles,
7.7 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) was added as a reducing agent, as this
concentration was effective in triggering the depolymerization of
assemblies based on PEtG block copolymers.27 Control experiments involved the application of stimuli to nonresponsive
PEtG–BnCO control particles to account for any nonspecific
effects of the stimuli as well as background degradation.

For
particles with each ratio of PEtG–NVOC:PLA, there was a rapid
decrease in count rate over the first hour following UV irradiation
that likely corresponded to degradation (Figure 4a). In addition, there were plateaus in the
count rates at percentages corresponding approximately to the percentage
of PLA in the particles. Pure PEtG particles approached zero counts
at the 24 h time point; 9:1 PEtG–NVOC:PLA particles degraded
to ∼10% of their original count rate and then remained constant;
7:3 PEtG–NVOC:PLA particles plateaued at ∼30% of the
initial count rate; and 50 wt % of PLA particles plateaued at ∼50%
of the initial count rate. Examination of the Z-average
diameter and PDI for a representative pure PEtG–NVOC particle
sample showed large fluctuations in diameter and an increase in PDI,
consistent with a major disruption of the particles (Table S5). In contrast, the diameter and PDI of 1:1 PEtG–NVOC:PLA
particles underwent only minor fluctuations, suggesting that the particles
were still largely intact due to the remaining PLA (Table S6). Light scattered from the pure PLA particles remained
constant at 100% of the original counts over the 24 h period, suggesting
that the system was stable over this time period. Furthermore, the
application of UV light to the control PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles
did not lead to any significant changes in count rate, demonstrating
the specificity of the stimulus.

Figure 4 Count rate as a function of time after
application of stimulus
for: (a) particles composed of PEtG–NVOC:PLA or controls PEtG–BnCO:PLA,
where the stimulus was UV light and (b) particles composed of PEtG–disulfide:PLA
or controls PEtG–BnCO:PLA, where the stimulus was DTT. The
error bars correspond to standard deviations.

As observed in our previous work with PEtG–PEO block
copolymer
assemblies,27 the reduction in count rate
occurred more slowly for the PEtG–dilsulfide:PLA systems in
response to DTT (Figure 4b). This may result from the reduction reaction being slower than
the photochemical end-cap cleavage. In addition, DTT is likely only
able to react with end-caps at the particle surface, whereas UV light
can penetrate the particles to some extent. Again, the particles with
higher PEtG content exhibited larger reductions in the count rate
over the experiment in general, corresponding to more complete degradation.
Both pure PEtG–dilsulfide and 1:1 PEtG–disulfide:PLA
particles underwent only minor fluctuations in Z-average
diameter and PDI, suggesting that even while PEtG was eroded, resulting
in a decrease in count rate, there were still particles remaining
at 48 h (Tables S7–S8). The count
rates from the pure PLA particles and all of the PLA:PEtG-BnCO particles
remained near 100% of their original values over 48 h.

The particle
degradation was also studied using a fluorescent probe.
Nile red is a hydrophobic dye that is highly fluorescent in hydrophobic
environments but undergoes aggregation and fluorescence quenching
in water.51,52 Therefore, Nile red encapsulated within
the particles fluoresces, and as it is released into the surrounding
aqueous environment, the fluorescence decreases. Nile red was encapsulated
using the same particle preparation method described above except
that 1 wt % of Nile red relative to polymer was incorporated into
the CH2Cl2 phase. The initial fluorescence intensity
was measured for each sample, and then UV light and DTT were applied
as stimuli to PEtG–NVOC:PLA, PEtG–disulfide:PLA, and
PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles as described above, and the fluorescence
was measured over 24 h. PEtG–NVOC:PLA particles exhibited a
significant burst release of Nile red within the first hour after
being exposed to UV light (Figure 5a). This can be attributed to the PEtG fraction of
the particles being degraded. Similar to the DLS study, the fluorescence
plateaued at higher percentages of the initial fluorescence as the
PLA content of the particles increased. This suggests that it may
be possible to selectively release a payload from the PEtG phase of
the particles, while retaining the load in the PLA phase. After application
of light to PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles, small reductions in the
Nile red fluorescence were observed. This could be attributed to some
background degradation of these systems, such as hydrolysis of the
carbonate linkage between the end-cap and polymer, which would induce
depolymerization. However, based on the DLS results described above,
it likely corresponds to the passive diffusion of some Nile red from
the peripheries of the particles or other factors that would alter
the environment of Nile red.

Figure 5 Fluorescence of the encapsulated hydrophobic
probe Nile red as
a function of time after application of stimulus for: (a) particles
composed of PEtG–NVOC:PLA or control PEtG–BnCO:PLA,
where the stimulus was UV light and (b) particles composed of PEtG–disulfide:PLA
or control PEtG–BnCO:PLA, where the stimulus was DTT. The error
bars correspond to standard deviations.

As observed in the DLS study, Nile red release from the PEtG–disulfide:PLA
particles following application of DTT was slower than for the light-responsive
particles (Figure 5b). Again, this can likely be attributed to slower end-cap cleavage.
However, this experiment also suggested that the extent of Nile red
release was dependent on the PLA content. The levels of release from
the PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles treated with DTT were similar to
those observed following UV irradiation of the same particles. Overall,
the DLS and Nile red release data show that it is possible to trigger
degradation of the particles specifically by matching the stimulus
with the end-cap and that it appears possible to trigger different
percentages of degradation by tuning the PLA content in the particles.

Drug Loading and Triggered Release
Celecoxib was selected
as an initial drug for investigating loading and release. It is a
widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and has shown potential
in cancer therapy.53,54 However, it exhibits low aqueous
solubility and adverse gastrointestinal and cardiac effects when administered
systemically.55,56 It was loaded into PEtG–NVOC:PLA,
PEtG–disulfide:PLA, and PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles during
their preparation by the addition of 30 wt % of drug relative to polymer
in the CH2Cl2 phase of the emulsion. Unloaded
drug was removed by filtration and dialysis. The loading efficiencies
ranged from 17 to 33% and the drug content from 4.9 to 8.8 wt %. However,
there were no statistically significant differences between the loadings
of the different PEtG:PLA ratios (Table S9). The particle diameters were very similar to those of the unloaded
particles described above (Tables S10–S12, Figures S8–S10).

Celecoxib release in response
to UV light and DTT was investigated for the PEtG–NVOC:PLA
and PEtG–disulfide:PLA systems, respectively, with the absence
of stimuli and the application of stimuli to 100% PEtG–BnCO:PLA
particles serving as controls. Initially, measurement of the released
celecoxib posed a significant challenge due to the low water solubility
of this drug. Upon application of the stimuli, the scattering of the
suspension clearly decreased, indicative of degradation, but at the
same time, the celecoxib precipitated (Figure S11). Due to this precipitation, use of a protocol involving
dialysis into buffer resulted in measurement of the precipitated drug’s
dissolution rate rather than its actual release. The addition of Polysorbate
20, which we have used successfully with celecoxib in other studies
in our lab, resulted in rapid release from control systems, suggesting
that it destabilized the particles. Thus, the released and precipitated
drug was instead centrifuged, dissolved in CH3CN, and then
quantified by UV–visible spectroscopy based on its absorbance
at 253 nm.

Application of UV light as a stimulus to the PEtG–NVOC
systems
resulted in a rapid release of celecoxib (Figure 6a). The percentage of released drug ranged
from 15 to 82% in the first 30 min, depending on the PEtG–NVOC:PLA
ratio. Over the first 4 h, 26–89% of celecoxib was released.
It is possible that the remaining ∼10% of the drug in the case
of the pure PEtG–NVOC system can be solubilized by the sodium
cholate surfactant in the system. The percentage of drug released
depended on the PEtG:PLA ratio, with higher PEtG content generally
leading to increased drug release. However, more release was observed
for the 1:1 system than for the 7:3 system, and the reason for this
is not clear. Less release was observed from pure PLA particles (Figure 6a), controls consisting
of nonirradiated PEtG–NVOC:PLA or UV-irradiated particles composed
of PEtG–BnCO:PLA (Figure 6b). Interestingly, the irradiated particles generally
had higher release than the nonirradiated particles, suggesting the
possibility of a nonspecific reaction involving UV light. However,
this was not observed in the DLS or Nile red experiments.

Figure 6 Celecoxib release
as a function of time from (a) PEtG–NVOC:PLA
particles irradiated with UV light; (b) PEtG–NVOC:PLA particles
not triggered with UV light (non-irr) and control PEtG–BnCO:PLA
particles irradiated with UV light (irr); and (c) PEtG–disulfide:PLA
particles treated with DTT; (d) PEtG–disulfide:PLA particles
not treated with DTT (no DTT) and control PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles
treated with DTT (DTT). The error bars correspond to standard deviations.

The addition of DTT to the PEtG–disulfide
systems also resulted
in the rapid release of celecoxib with similar trends observed with
respect to the PEtG:PLA ratio as for the PEtG–NVOC systems
(Figure 6c). However,
consistent with the DLS and Nile red studies, this release was slower
than for the UV light-triggered release, with 7–44% of celecoxib
released over the first 4 h and 32–80% released over 24 h,
again suggesting end-cap cleavage as the rate-limiting step. Again,
control PLA particles (Figure 6c), PEtG–disulfide:PLA without DTT added and PEtG–BnCO:PLA
(Figure 6d) with DTT
added, exhibited slower release than the triggered systems. Nevertheless,
the level of release from the control systems appeared to be relatively
high, ranging from 18 to 49% over 4 h in the UV light experiment and
21–46% over 24 h in the DTT experiment. For this reason, we
assessed the composition of the precipitated and centrifuged material
from the 4 and 24 h time points by dissolving it in CD3CN and analyzing it by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figures S12–S20). By comparison of the
spectra with those of celecoxib, PLA, and PEtG, it was found that
after application of DTT to the PEtG–disulfide:PLA particles
the pellet was primarily composed of celecoxib and not polymer, confirming
its release from the particles and effective isolation by centrifugation.
On the other hand, the pellets obtained from PEtG–disulfide:PLA
particles not exposed to DTT or PEtG–BnCO:PLA particles exposed
to DTT contained mostly intact PEtG and PLA, indicating that some
drug-loaded particles were destabilized and isolated during the centrifugation
procedure, resulting in apparent release percentages for the controls
that are likely higher than the true celecoxib release rates. Thus,
the true leakage rates of celecoxib from the untriggered particles
are likely lower than those reflected in Figures 6b and 6d. Nevertheless,
this was still the most effective protocol to measure and demonstrate
the triggered release of celecoxib from these systems and the ability
to tune the release profile by tuning the PLA content.

In
Vitro Studies
As noted above, celecoxib
has been shown to exhibit anticancer properties, and there is value
in releasing anticancer drugs specifically in cancer cells in order
to mitigate the side effects that can result from their systemic administration.53 Therefore, the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
line was selected to evaluate the toxicities of different particles
in both the absence and presence of stimuli using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. This study focused on the systems composed of
pure PEtG rather than blends with PLA, in order to maximize the effect
of the stimuli.

Following a 48 h incubation of the drug with
cells, free celecoxib was found to have an IC50 value of
∼30 μg/mL in this cell line (Figure 7a). When celecoxib-loaded PEtG–NVOC
particles were incubated with the cells for 48 h in the absence of
any stimuli, they were found to be somewhat less toxic than the free
drug, with an IC50 value near the maximum concentration
studied of ∼75 μg/mL (concentration of loaded drug).
On the other hand, when celecoxib-loaded PEtG–NVOC particles
were incubated with the cells for 24 h (to allow uptake into cells),
irradiated with 360 nm light (LED flashlights, 90 mW/cm2) for 15 min, and then incubated an additional 24 h, the IC50 was reduced to ∼30 μg/mL, similar to that of free celecoxib.
This is consistent with the release of drug from the system. It should
be noted that cells exposed to 360 nm light, but no particles, did
not exhibit any significant reduction in metabolic activity relative
to nonirradiated cells, showing that this short irradiation process
did not alone lead to toxicity. The toxicity of PEtG–NVOC particles
without drug was also studied. The particles began to exhibit some
toxicity at concentrations of 500 μg/mL and above (Figure 7c). Initially this
was surprising as the PEtG and its degradation products were expected
to be benign. However, when we studied the toxicity of the free sodium
cholate, the surfactant used to stabilize the particles, we found
that it began to cause toxicity at ∼300 μg/mL (Figure 7d). Based on mass
recovery studies, we found that our particles were composed of ∼1.5:1
mass ratio of sodium cholate:PEtG. Therefore, despite cholic acid
being one of the major bile acids produced in the liver, in this assay
it is likely that most of the toxicity arose from the sodium cholate.
In addition, based on the drug loading of ∼8 wt % for the PEtG–NVOC
system (1000 μg/mL of PEtG–NVOC needed to deliver 80
μg/mL of celecoxib), some of the toxicity arising from the nonirradiated
celecoxib-loaded PEtG–NVOC system (Figure 7a) likely resulted from the delivery system
itself (due to the cholate). The effect of the UV light would perhaps
be larger were this not the case.

assays, of MDA-MB-231 cells

particles without stimulus or with 10 mM glutathione added at 24 h;
(c) particles composed of either PEtG–NVOC or PEtG–disulfide

standard deviations.

The PEtG–disulfide system was studied in a similar
manner,
except that in this case the reducing agent glutathione (10 mM) was
added as the stimulus following 24 h of incubation, and then the system
was incubated for an additional 24 h. As for the PEtG–NVOC
system, the triggered system and free celecoxib had similar IC50 values of ∼30 μg/mL, while the celecoxib-loaded
PEtG–disulfide without GSH added had a somewhat higher IC50 value of ∼60 μg/mL (Figure 7b). Thus, it appears that the GSH has a modest
effect.

Conclusions
Blends of PLA with self-immolative
PEtG were studied for the preparation
of drug delivery particles. UV light-responsive, thiol-responsive,
and nonresponsive control end-caps were used. Thermal studies suggested
that PEtG and PLA were mainly phase separated, as Tg values of both blocks were observed using DSC. Using
an emulsification–evaporation procedure with sodium cholate
as a surfactant, we prepared particles with diameters of 130–150
nm. Upon application of the appropriate stimuli, the PEtG portions
of the particles degraded, resulting in partial degradation of the
systems as a function of the PEtG:PLA ratio. Using Nile red as a fluorescent
probe and celecoxib as a drug, it was demonstrated that the triggered
PEtG depolymerization could be used to release a portion of the loaded
drug, leaving the remaining drug encapsulated in the PLA phase. The
fraction of rapidly released drug could be tuned based on the PEtG:PLA
ratio. Celecoxib-loaded PEtG particles with UV light and thiol-responsive
end-caps were investigated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Triggering
of these systems with their corresponding stimuli in the presence
of cells led to toxicities similar to that of free celecoxib and somewhat
higher than the corresponding untriggered systems. However, differences
between the triggered and untriggered systems were reduced by some
background toxicity of the systems at high concentrations that likely
results from the sodium cholate surfactant. In the future, this limitation
can be mitigated by changing the surfactant, increasing the drug loadings,
or using a more potent drug that requires less drug and vehicle to
achieve the desired biological effect.

Methods
General Materials
and Procedures
PEtG–NVOC (Mn = 70 kg/mol, Đ = 2.4), PEtG–BnCO
(Mn = 56 kg/mol, Đ = 1.6), and
PEtG–disulfide (Mn = 24 kg/mol, Đ = 1.4) were prepared as previously
reported.31,38 Their molar mass data were obtained from
size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in THF at 1 mL/min using a Viscotek
GPC Max VE2001 solvent module equipped with a Viscotek VE3580 RI detector
operating at 30 °C, two Agilent Polypore (300 × 7.5 mm)
columns, and a Polypore guard column (50 × 7.5 mm). A calibration
curve was obtained using polystyrene standards. Sodium cholate hydrate,
GSH, DTT, Nile red, and PLA (18–28 kg/mol) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich. Celecoxib was purchased from Ontario Chemicals, Inc.
TGA was performed on a Q50 from TA Instruments at a heating rate of
10 °C/min from 35 to 500 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
DSC was performed using a Q2000 from TA Instruments (New Castle, DE).
The heating/cooling rate was 10 °C/min from −75 to +120
°C. Data were obtained from the second heating cycle. Fluorescence
spectra were obtained using a QM-4 SE spectrometer from Photon Technology
International equipped with double excitation and emission monochromators.
UV–visible spectra were obtained on a Varian UV/vis Cary 300
spectrophotometer. Ultrapure water was obtained from a Barnstead EASYpure
II system. Spectra/Por regenerated cellulose membranes were used for
dialysis. 0.22 μm Acrodisc Syringe Filters (nonpyrogenic) with
13 mm diameter were used to filter particle suspensions for analysis.
DLS was performed using a Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument from Malvern
Instruments at 25 °C at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL of polymer
assemblies. The Z-average diameter and PDI index
for each series of particles were measured in triplicate. TEM imaging
was done using a Phillips CM10 microscope operating at an acceleration
voltage of 80 kV with a 40 μm aperture. An amount of 20 μL
of particle suspension (1.0 mg/mL) was placed on a copper grid, and
the excess liquid was wicked off with a Kimwipe. The resulting sample
was air-dried for 24 h before imaging.

Preparation of PLA–PEtG
Blends
Blends of 9:1,
7:3, and 1:1 PEtG:PLA were prepared by combining 9.0, 7.0, and 5.0
mg of PEtG with 1.0, 3.0, or 5.0 mg of PLA, respectively. These polymer
samples were then dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1 mL)
and stirred for 30 min to allow for complete mixing of the polymers.
The solvent was removed in vacuo for analyses.

Preparation of Particles
PEtG, PLA, or PEtG:PLA blend
(10 mg) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1 mL). A separate
solution of sodium cholate (50 mg) was prepared in distilled water
(10 mL). The organic phase was added to the aqueous phase in a 20
mL glass vial. The sonication amplitude was set to 10% intensity on
a Branson 450 Digital Sonifier. The biphasic mixture was then sonicated
for three 30 s intervals with 10 s breaks in between for a total of
90 s of sonication over 120 s. To the resulting emulsion, a magnetic
stir bar was added, and the solution was vigorously stirred overnight
(16 h) to evaporate the organic phase. After evaporation of the organic
phase, the particle suspension was dialyzed (3500 g/mol molecular-weight
cutoff (MWCO) dialysis membrane, 8 h) against distilled water to remove
any excess sodium cholate or trace organic solvent.

Particle Degradation
Studied by DLS
Particles were
prepared as described above, with the exception that the resulting
suspensions were dialyzed against 100 mM, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer
(1 L, 24 h, water changed once at ∼12 h). The final polymer
concentration was diluted to ∼0.1 mg/mL. The count rate was
measured by DLS while fixing the attenuator at 7 (t = 0 reading). For PEtG–NVOC and the PEtG–BnCO control,
irradiation with UV light was performed in an ACE Glass photochemistry
cabinet containing a mercury light source (450 W bulb, 2.8 mW/cm2 of UVA radiation) for 30 min. A t = 30 min
count rate measurement was obtained. Then the samples were incubated
at 37 °C in the dark, and the DLS count rate was measured at
additional time points over 24 h. For PEtG–disulfide and the
PEtG–BnCO control, DTT (7.7 mmol) was added, and then the samples
were incubated at 37 °C in the dark. The DLS count rate was measured
at various time points over 24 h. Control experiments without stimulus
were also included in each case. Each experiment was performed in
triplicate.

Loading and Triggered Release of Nile Red
Nile-red-loaded
PEtG, PLA, or PEtG:PLA particles were prepared by the addition of
Nile red (0.1 mg) to the CH2Cl2 solution of
PEtG or PEtG:PLA. The solution was stirred for several hours to ensure
complete mixing, and then the particle preparation was performed as
described above. The resulting suspensions were dialyzed against 100
mM, pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. The suspensions were then diluted 10-fold
in the same buffer. Using an excitation wavelength of 540 nm, the
initial emission intensity of Nile red was measured at 602 nm to obtain
fluorescence at T0 (starting time). At this point, the appropriate
stimuli (UV light for PEtG–NVOC and DTT for PEtG–disulfide)
were applied as described above for the DLS study, and the suspensions
were placed in a 37 °C oven. Fluorescence measurements were taken
at time points over a 24 h period. By comparing the fluorescence at
each time point with its initial fluorescence, the percent initial
fluorescence was calculated. These measurements were taken in triplicate.

Preparation of Celecoxib-Loaded Particles
Particles
were prepared as described above with the addition of celecoxib (30
wt %, 3.0 mg, 7.9 μmol) dissolved in the CH2Cl2 phase with the polymer mixtures before sonication. After
evaporation of the organic phase, the particle suspension was filtered
through a pipet containing a cotton filter to remove any unloaded
drug crystals. The resulting suspension was further dialyzed (3500
g/mol molecular-weight cutoff (MWCO) dialysis membrane, 16 h) against
distilled water (1 × 1 L) to remove excess sodium cholate and
any soluble free drug. Afterward, 0.1 mL of the particle suspension
was diluted with 1.4 mL of acetonitrile. The absorbance of the resulting
solution was measured by UV–visible spectroscopy at 253 nm.
The concentration was calculated based on a celecoxib calibration
curve (ε = 16 400 L/mol·cm, acetonitrile, 253 nm),
and the loading efficiency and drug content of the particles were
calculated as follows.    

Release of Celecoxib from Particles
Celecoxib-loaded
particles in pH 7.4 buffer were prepared as described above. An initial
absorbance measurement was taken by removing 200 μL of each
sample and dissolving it in 1 mL of acetonitrile. Insoluble buffer
salts were removed by filtration, and the absorbance was measured
at 253 nm in order to quantify the initial amount of drug in the system.
Subsequently, the appropriate stimuli were applied as described above
for the DLS degradation study. The samples were then each placed in
an individual 20 mL vial equipped with a small bar magnet, stirred
at low rpm, and kept in a 37 °C oven for the duration of the
study. At specified time points, each sample was centrifuged for 3
min at 2800g to separate the precipitated drug from
the suspended particles. The suspension was decanted back into the
initial vial and placed back into the oven, while the pellet was dissolved
in 1 mL of acetonitrile and the absorbance at 253 nm measured to quantify
the amount of drug that had been released and consequently precipitated
(appropriate dilutions performed to ensure an absorbance less than
1.0). This amount was compared to the initial amount of encapsulated
drug in order to determine the percentage of released drug. 1H NMR spectra of the pellets were obtained at 400 MHz in CD3CN at 4 and 24 h, to confirm the identity of the precipitated material.

In Vitro Cell Toxicity Study
Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L of d-glucose and
110 mg/L of sodium pyruvate was obtained from Gibco. Penicillin-streptomycin
(Pen Strep, 10000 U/mL), l-glutamine, fetal bovine serum
(FBS), and trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) were obtained from Gibco. The MDA-MB-231
cells were cultured in DMEM with 10 vol % FBS, 100 units/mL of Pen
Strep, and 2 mM l-glutamine added in an atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate
(Corning Flat Bottom Plate) at a density of 10 000 cells/well
and allowed to adhere for 24 h. The medium was then aspirated and
replaced with varying concentrations of particles, just medium as
a negative control, or sodium lauryl sulfate as a positive control.
For nontriggered samples, the cells were incubated for 48 h with the
materials. For irradiated PEtG–NVOC samples, the cells were
incubated for 24 h with the particles and irradiated for 15 min with
two 360 nm light-emitting diode (LED) flashlights (Convoy S2+, 90
mMW/cm2 at a distance of 5 cm), and then the cells were
incubated for a further 24 h. For GSH-triggered PEtG-disulfide samples,
the cells were incubated for 24 h with the particles, and then 10
mM GSH was added. The cells were incubated for an additional 24 h.
Controls did not involve stimuli. The medium was then aspirated and
replaced with 100 μL of fresh medium containing 0.5 mg/mL of
MTT reagent and allowed to react for 4 h in the incubator. After 4
h the plate was removed, and the MTT reagent solution was aspirated.
An amount of 50 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well
to solubilize the purple crystals. The plate was then placed in a
plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro), and the absorbance at 540
nm was measured to quantify the relative metabolic activities of the
cells.
