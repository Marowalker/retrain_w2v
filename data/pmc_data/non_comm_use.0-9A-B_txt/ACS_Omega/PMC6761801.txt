Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), essential
elements in host innate
immune defenses against numerous pathogens, have received considerable
attention as potential alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Most
AMPs exert broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity through depolarization
and permeabilization of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Here,
we introduce a new approach for enhancing the antibiotic activity
of AMPs by conjugation of a cationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP).
Interestingly, CPP-conjugated AMPs elicited only a 2- to 4-fold increase
in antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but showed
a 4- to 16-fold increase in antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative
bacteria. Although CPP–AMP conjugates did not significantly
increase membrane permeability, they efficiently translocated across
a lipid bilayer. Indeed, confocal microscopy showed that, while AMPs
were localized mainly in the membrane of Escherichia
coli, the conjugates readily penetrated bacterial
cells. In addition, the conjugates exhibited a higher affinity for
DNA than unconjugated AMPs. Collectively, we demonstrate that CPP–AMP
conjugates possess multiple functional properties, including membrane
permeabilization, membrane translocation, and DNA binding, which are
involved in their enhanced antibacterial activity against Gram-negative
bacteria. We propose that conjugation of CPPs to AMPs may present
an effective approach for the development of novel antimicrobials
against Gram-negative bacteria.

Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play crucial
roles in nonspecific
host defenses and innate immunity and are known to have a wide range
of activity against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.1−3 AMPs exhibit considerable potential as novel antimicrobials and
have been studied extensively as a result of the increased tolerance
to currently available antimicrobial agents.4−12 Because of their cationic nature, AMPs are initially attracted to
negatively charged molecules on microbial surfaces, such as lipopolysaccharides
(LPS) in Gram-negative and teichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria.
Although the precise mechanisms are still not completely understood,
it is widely accepted that their mode of antibiotic action involves
depolarization and/or permeabilization of the bacterial cell membrane.13−20 Some AMPs have also been suggested to cross the membrane without
eliciting significant membrane permeabilization, following which they
inhibit varied intracellular functions, including the nucleic acid
and protein synthesis.21−24

Cationic cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can cross plasma
membranes
and facilitate cellular uptake of numerous molecules.25,26 Consequently, arginine-rich CPPs, like R9, have been widely employed
as vectors for intracellular delivery of membrane-impermeable biomacromolecules.25,27 In this study, we utilized R9 to enhance the antimicrobial activity
of AMPs through a dual mode of action, namely, membrane integrity
disruption and intracellular activity inhibition. We conjugated R9
to AMPs (magainin and M15), the sequences of which are listed in Table 1. Here, we evaluated
the antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of magainin, M15, and
CPP–AMP conjugates by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) and the levels of hemolysis, respectively. To investigate the
mechanism of action of the conjugates, we conducted membrane depolarization
and permeabilization assays and visualized the site of action by confocal
laser-scanning microscopy. We found that, compared to AMPs, CPP–AMP
conjugates showed significantly enhanced antimicrobial activity against
Gram-negative bacteria, likely because of membrane integrity disruption
coupled to secondary intracellular targeting. This is among the first
to show CPP–AMP conjugation as a novel strategy for the design
of peptide antibiotics with potent antibacterial activity against
Gram-negative bacteria. We propose that the multiple functions of
CPP–AMP conjugates make it less likely that microorganisms
will develop antibiotic resistance against them.

Results
Effect of CPP–AMP
Conjugation on Antibacterial and Hemolytic
Activities
The magainin and M15 used in this study are cationic
and amphipathic α-helical peptides, which is believed that the
peptides exert their activity by permeabilizing cytoplasmic membranes.
R9 belongs to the class of arginine-rich CPPs, which have the ability
to cross cell membranes. First, AMPs (magainin and M15) and CPP-conjugated
AMPs (R9-magainin and R9-M15) were tested for their cytotoxicity against
human erythrocytes (Table 1) and their ability to kill bacteria (Table 2). Magainin and M15 both showed weak hemolytic
activity, even at high concentrations. Moreover, only a small difference
in hemolytic activity was observed between AMPs and CPP–AMP
conjugates, indicating that CPP conjugation to AMPs does not elicit
cytotoxicity. Magainin and M15 showed moderate antibacterial activity
against all Gram-positive and -negative bacteria tested, with MIC
values in the 8–32 μM range. Alone, R9 did not exhibit
antimicrobial activity against any of the bacterial strains, even
at the highest tested concentration of 128 μM, but there was
a 2- to 4-fold increase in the antimicrobial activity of CPP–AMP
conjugates against Gram-positive bacteria; interestingly, however,
CPP–AMP conjugates exerted more improved antimicrobial activity
(4- to 16-fold) against Gram-negative bacteria, with MIC values in
the 1–4 μM range. We also evaluated the antimicrobial
activity of unconjugated AMPs in the presence of R9. At a concentration
of 16 μM, R9 had a limited effect on the MICs of magainin and
M15. Together, these data suggest that CPP conjugation to AMPs greatly
improves antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram-negative
bacteria.

Structural Characterization
We next analyzed the secondary
structure of magainin, M15, and their R9 conjugates (R9-magainin and
R9-M15) in aqueous buffer and in membrane-mimicking environments using
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Figure 1). All the peptides exhibited negative bands
at approximately 200 nm in aqueous buffer, indicating that their structures
are random. However, the peptides also displayed two negative bands
at 208 and 222 nm and a positive band at 195 nm in 30 mM sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) micelles, suggesting that the peptides adopt an α-helical
structure in membrane environments. Compared to magainin and M15,
the R9 conjugates showed a relatively strong negative band at 205
nm, which is very different from a typical α-helix, likely because
of the flexible R9 sequences. However, the overall CD spectral patterns
were similar between AMPs and CPP–AMP conjugates, suggesting
that CPP conjugation did not significantly affect the amphipathic
α-helical structure of the AMPs.

Figure 1 CD spectra of the peptides.
The CD spectra of magainin and R9-magainin
(A) and M15 and R9-M15 (B) were obtained at 25 °C in aqueous
buffer (open symbols), or 30 mm SDS micelles (closed symbols) in the
presence of 25 μm concentrations of magainin (◯), R9-magainin
(△), M15 (●), and R9-M15 (▽).

Membrane Permeabilization and Depolarization
To determine
the extent to which membrane permeabilization of Gram-negative bacteria
contributed to the antimicrobial activity of the peptides, we first
examined the ability of the peptides to increase outer membrane permeability
by measuring the incorporation of the 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine
(NPN) fluorescent probe into the outer membrane of Escherichia coli (Figure 2A). The NPN probe is excluded from an intact
outer membrane of E. coli, but membrane
destabilization allows entry of NPN into the phospholipid layer, resulting
in prominent fluorescence. The peptides induced NPN uptake in a dose-dependent
manner, indicative of their ability to disrupt the outer membrane
barrier. However, the AMPs and CPP-conjugated AMPs both showed similar
permeabilizing activity on the E. coli outer membrane and could not, therefore, explain the enhanced antimicrobial
activity of the CPP–AMP conjugates. To complete membrane permeabilization,
peptides must reach and permeabilize the inner membrane. We next investigated
the permeability of inner membranes induced by the peptides using E. coli ML-35 cells that lack the lactose permease
enzyme necessary for o-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside
(ONPG) uptake. If the peptides induced inner membrane permeabilization,
ONPG would enter the cytoplasm and would be cleaved to o-nitrophenol (ONP) by cytoplasmic β-galactosidase. Released
ONP was determined spectrophotometrically. Although all the peptides
induced E coli inner membrane permeability
in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2B), there were only marginal differences
in the degrees of inner membrane permeabilization between the AMPs
and CPP-conjugated AMPs. Therefore, permeabilization of the inner
membrane does not seem to correlate with the antimicrobial potency
of the conjugates.

Figure 2 Peptide-induced membrane permeabilization and depolarization.

Outer membrane permeability of E. coli induced by the peptides. E. coli were
incubated with NPN in the presence of various concentrations of the
peptides. The NPN uptake was determined by a fluorescence increase
resulting from the NPN partitions into the hydrophobic interior of
the outer membrane. (B) Permeabilization of the inner membrane of E. coli ML-35 cells by the peptides. Permeabilization
was determined by the unmasking of cytoplasmic β-galactosidase,
as assessed by hydrolysis of the impermeable, chromogenic substrate
ONPG. (C) Membrane depolarization of intact S. aureus and E. coli cells by the peptides.
The peptides were added after the fluorescence of membrane potential-sensitive
dye DiSC3(5) was stabilized. In order for DiSC3(5) to reach the cytoplasmic
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli were pretreated with EDTA (15 mM). (D) Membrane permeabilization
of negatively charged PC/PG (1:1) or neutral PC liposomes by the peptides
visualized with the fluorescent dye calcein. The peptides (2 μM)
were added into 100 μM liposomes. The error bars represent standard
deviations of the mean determined from three independent experiments.

Because Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive
to CPP–AMP
conjugates, we then compared membrane depolarization between Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli as representatives of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria,
respectively (Figure 2C). The ability of the peptides to depolarize the membrane was assessed
using the membrane potential-sensitive fluorescent dye 3,3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine
[DiSC3(5)]. This dye inserts into the cytoplasmic membrane and its
fluorescence is influenced by the membrane potential gradient. As
expected, magainin and M15 depolarized the cytoplasmic membrane of
both S. aureus and E.
coli, even below their MIC values; however, the CPP–AMP
conjugates also elicited effective membrane depolarization, similar
to that observed for the unconjugated AMPs. Therefore, there was no
direct correlation between cytoplasmic membrane depolarization and
MIC values, indicating that other mechanisms likely exist through
which CPP-conjugated AMPs exert their potent antimicrobial activity
against Gram-negative bacteria.

We also evaluated the ability
of the peptides to induce membrane
permeabilization by examining calcein leakage from negatively charged
PC/PG (1:1) and zwitterionic PC liposomes (Figure 2D). Following the addition of the peptides
to liposomes encapsulating calcein, the release of calcein from the
liposomes was measured. All the peptides showed a relatively weak
ability to disrupt zwitterionic PC liposomes, agreeing well with the
results obtained for hemolytic activity. In the negatively charged
liposomes, AMPs and CPP-conjugated AMPs both showed similarly strong
membrane-lytic activity, consistent with their respective capacities
to depolarize bacterial cell membranes. However, the similar membrane-lytic
activities could not explain the enhanced antimicrobial activity of
the CPP-AMP conjugates. While the disruption of membrane integrity
represents a major killing event for AMPs, other targets may be involved
in the bactericidal effect of CPP-conjugated AMPs against Gram-negative
bacteria.

LPS Neutralization by Peptides
It is assumed that AMPs
initially interact with the surfaces of Gram-negative bacteria composed
of LPS; moreover, the permeability of the outer membrane appears to
be a key determinant of their antimicrobial activity.28 Indeed, some AMPs have been shown to exhibit effective
bactericidal and anti-inflammatory activities against Gram-negative
bacteria by binding to LPS and neutralizing it.29,30 To examine whether the improved antimicrobial activity of CPP–AMP
conjugates is correlated with their ability to bind LPS, we next assessed
the LPS neutralization capacity of the peptides using a limulus amebocyte
lysate (LAL) assay (Figure 3A). All the peptides neutralized LPS activity in a dose-dependent
manner. Interestingly, CPP–AMP conjugates showed stronger LPS-neutralizing
activity than unconjugated AMPs. These results suggest that the increased
LPS-neutralizing activity of CPP-conjugated AMPs may correlate with
their antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria.

of the peptides as determined by the LAL assay. LPS was incubated
with different peptide concentrations for 30 min. (B) Inhibitory effect
of peptides on TNF-α release and NO production from LPS-stimulated
RAW264.7 cells. The cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) were
treated with 20 ng/mL LPS in the presence or absence of 2 μM
of each peptide. The error bars represent standard deviations of the
mean determined from three independent experiments.

LPS induces inflammatory pathways, leading to cytokine production.31 To further investigate the ability of the peptides
to neutralize LPS, we measured their effects on LPS-stimulated tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) release and nitric oxide (NO)
production in RAW264.7 macrophage cells (Figure 3B). When the cells were treated with 20 ng/mL
LPS, TNF-α and NO were released. Compared to magainin and M15
alone, the R9 conjugates (R9-magainin and R9-M15) significantly inhibited
TNF-α release and NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells,
indicating that the conjugates bind LPS more efficiently than unconjugated
AMPs. The efficient binding of CPP–AMP conjugates to LPS could
partially explain their enhanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative
bacteria. These results also suggest that CPP conjugation to AMPs
can be an effective approach for the development of anti-inflammatory
agents.

Ability of CPP–AMP Conjugates to Translocate into Liposomes
Several studies recently showed that several peptides show strong
bactericidal activity without causing severe disruption of membrane
integrity.21,23,32,33 These peptides are thought to kill bacteria
by interfering with essential cellular processes by blocking synthesis
of DNA or protein. Because the antimicrobial activity of AMPs may
be coupled to intracellular targets, we investigated the capacity
of the peptides to translocate across membranes by measuring the resonance
energy transfer from the Trp residues of the peptides to the dansyl
group of DNS-PE incorporated into the membrane (Figure 4). The translocation of Trp-containing AMPs
across PC/PG (1:1) liposomes labeled with DNS-PE was investigated
by monitoring the degradation of the peptides by chymotrypsin confined
in the liposomes. Trypsin inhibitors were used to prevent peptide
degradation by extraliposomal chymotrypsin. When a peptide solution
(2 μM) was added to liposomes (200 μM), binding of the
peptide to the membrane increased fluorescence intensity by resonance
energy transfer from the Trp residues to dansyl group. Following translocation,
the internalized peptides should be digested by liposome-entrapped
chymotrypsin, resulting in reduced fluorescence intensity. We observed
only a small change in fluorescence with magainin and M15, indicating
an absence of membrane translocation. In contrast, R9-magainin and
R9-M15 both evoked a time-dependent reduction in fluorescence intensity,
indicating that the peptides effectively translocated across the lipid
bilayer.

Figure 4 Peptide translocation across lipid bilayers. Peptide translocation
across the membrane was monitored by measuring the resonance energy
transfer from the Trp residues of the peptides to the dansyl group
of DNS-PE incorporated into the liposomes. Once peptides are translocated
into liposomes, the internalized peptides are degraded by α-chymotrypsin
trapped in the liposome, which eventually reduces fluorescence. The
peptide and lipid concentrations were 2 and 200 μM, respectively.

Confocal Laser-Scanning Microscopy
To further examine
the entry of CPP–AMP conjugates into bacterial cells, we incubated
FITC-labeled peptides with E. coli and
visualized their localization by confocal laser-scanning microscopy
(Figure 5). As expected,
FITC-labeled magainin was associated with the surface of E. coli cells, indicating that its major site of
action is the bacterial membrane. In contrast, FITC-labeled R9-magainin
penetrated the E. coli cell membranes
and accumulated in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that CPP-conjugated
AMPs have a secondary intracellular target.

in E. coli cells. E.
coli were incubated with
FITC-labeled magainin (A) or FITC-labeled R9-magainin conjugate (B)
for 30 min at 37 °C and imaged by confocal laser-scanning microscopy.

Interaction of the Peptides with Plasmid
DNA
We next
examined the DNA-binding properties of the peptides because some AMPs
have the ability to target intracellular molecules after passing through
cell membranes. Peptide interaction with plasmid DNA was assessed
by a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 6). The plasmid (DNA 200 ng) was mixed with
various concentrations of the peptides to form complexes at room temperature
for 30 min and the DNA-binding abilities of the peptides were evaluated
by measuring the retardation of plasmid DNA migration on the agarose
gel. Magainin had little effect on DNA migration even at concentrations
up to 128 μg/mL. In contrast, R9-magainin completely inhibited
DNA migration at a concentration of 2 μg/mL, indicating that
the R9-magainin conjugate bound DNA efficiently.

The interaction of magainin (A) and R9-magainin
(B) with plasmid DNA was evaluated by agarose gel retardation assay.
The peptide concentration indicated in each lane represents a serial
increase in concentration from 0.5 to 128 μg/mL.

Discussion
AMPs have received considerable attention
as new classes of antibiotics
because they exhibit rapid and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities
and appear to be less likely to elicit the development of microbial
resistance.34,35 It is generally accepted that
AMPs exert their antimicrobial activity through bacterial membrane
depolarization and permeabilization.36−39 However, the degree of permeabilization
associated with several AMPs often does not correlate with their antimicrobial
activity.40−42 Interestingly, recent findings suggest that the bactericidal
effects of some antibacterial peptides involve multiple modes of action,
including the disruption of membrane integrity coupled to the inhibition
of intracellular functions.43,44

As a way to enhance
antimicrobial activity, some recent studies
have been conducted on the covalent linkage of membrane-active AMPs
with conventional antibiotics that act on targets other than membrane
permeability.45−48 For example, the vancomycin–magainin conjugate has been shown
to increase antibacterial activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococci.46 It has
also been reported that the conjugation of chloramphenicol to ubicidin
improved the MIC values of Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli, and in
particular, an effective bactericidal ability was observed even in
bacterial-infected mouse models.47 On the
other hand, Ghaffar et al. reported that the physical mixture of levofloxacin
and indolicidin was far superior in the antimicrobial activity than
the levofloxacin–indolicidin conjugate.48 It should be noted that the active site of the small-molecule
antibiotics can be modified by a covalent bond, which can reduce its
antibacterial activity.

In the present study, we showed that
the simultaneous introduction
of CPP and AMP did not contribute to antimicrobial activity, that
is, no synergistic effect was observed. However, CPP conjugation to
AMPs resulted in improved antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative
bacteria without cytotoxicity. Although the CPP–AMP conjugates
could depolarize and permeabilize bacterial cell membranes and model
liposomes, this capacity was not different from that observed for
AMPs alone. However, CPP conjugation to AMPs facilitated translocation
across the membrane and entry into bacterial cells. The DNA retardation
assay showed that the AMP–CPP conjugates have a higher affinity
for DNA than the AMPs alone. The high positive charge of the conjugated
peptide seems to allow interaction with negatively charged molecules
in cells. Therefore, the increased antimicrobial activity observed
for the CPP-conjugated AMPs could be explained by membrane disruption
coupled to secondary intracellular targeting.

Numerous bacteria
have developed resistance to existing antibiotics,
and this resistance is a growing threat to public health.49,50 Gram-negative bacteria are of particular concern because they possess
a protective outer membrane consisting of LPS.51,52 The first step in the interaction between AMPs and bacterial membranes
is thought to be the binding of positively charged peptides to the
negatively charged LPS on the outer bacterial surface. Because the
bacterial outer membrane functions as a permeability barrier, Gram-negative
bacteria appear to be protected from the lytic action of some antimicrobial
proteases.53 To be effective against Gram-negative
bacteria, the outer membrane permeability barrier must first be overcome.
The conjugates also showed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than
the AMPs alone in LPS-stimulated macrophages through neutralization
of LPS. Binding to LPS may facilitate conjugate delivery to its site
of action, thus strengthening antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative
bacteria. In addition, these results also indicate that CPP conjugation
to AMPs can be an effective approach for the development of anti-inflammatory
agents.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to investigate
the effects of CPP–AMP conjugates on antimicrobial activity
as well as their mode of action. Our results suggest that CPP conjugation
to AMPs may be useful for increasing antimicrobial activity and selectivity
against Gram-negative bacteria. Our data also suggest that CPP conjugation
to AMPs may bestow multiple additional functions on AMPs, including
LPS-binding, translocation across membranes, and DNA binding, factors
that are key for enhanced antimicrobial activity. The present design
of CPP–AMP conjugation may be a promising strategy for the
development of new types of antimicrobial drugs against multidrug-resistant
bacteria.

Experimental Section
Materials
All peptides were synthesized
using the standard
Fmoc-based solid-phase method on Rink amide MBHA resin. N-α-Fmoc (fluoren-9-yl-methoxycarbonyl) amino acids with orthogonal
side-chain-protecting groups were purchased from Novabiochem (Läufelfingen,
Switzerland). The reagents and solvents (highest commercially available
purity) for peptide synthesis were obtained from Applied Biosystems
(Foster City, CA, USA). For the FITC-labeled peptides, the Fmoc-ε-Ahx-OH
was added to the N-terminus of the protected peptide using standard
coupling conditions and it was confirmed that FITC-labeled peptides
exhibited similar antimicrobial activity to their respective unlabeled
peptides. The purity of the synthesized peptides was confirmed by
analytical reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (above
98% pure). The correct molecular mass of the purified peptides was
confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Shimadzu, Japan). The phospholipids were
purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). A membrane
potential-sensitive probe, DiSC3(5), was obtained from Molecular Probes
(Eugene, OR, USA). All other reagents were of analytical grade.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
The CD spectra of the
peptides were recorded using a Jasco J-715 CD spectrophotometer (Tokyo,
Japan) in wavelengths ranging from 190 to 250 nm, with a scanning
speed of 50 nm/min, a step resolution of 0.1 nm, a response time of
0.5 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The CD spectra of the peptides were
collected and averaged over four scans in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2) or 30 mM SDS micelles, at 25 °C.

Antimicrobial and Hemolytic
Activities
Antimicrobial
activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (2 ×
106 CFU/mL) was determined by measuring the MIC using a
broth microdilution method, as previously described.54 Four types of Gram-positive bacterial strains, namely, Bacillus subtilis (KCTC 3068), Staphylococcus
epidermidis (KCTC 1917), Enterococcus
faecalis (KCTC 2011), and S. aureus (KCTC 1621); and four types of Gram-negative bacterial strains,
namely, E. coli (KCTC 1682), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (KCTC 1637), Proteus vulgaris (KCTC 2433) and Salmonella
typhimurium (KCTC 1926), were procured from the Korean
Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) at the Korea Research Institute
of Bioscience and Biotechnology (Daejon, Korea). Hemolytic activity
was tested against human red blood cells (1 × 106 cells/mL)
as previously described.54 Zero and one
hundred percent hemolysis were determined in phosphate-buffered saline
and 0.1% Triton X-100, respectively.

Inner and Outer Membrane
Permeability
The inner membrane
permeabilizing potential of the peptides was investigated using the
fluorescent dye N-phenyl-1-napthylamine (NPN), as
previously described.55 Briefly, E. coli cells grown to the midlogarithmic phase were
resuspended in 5 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.2) containing
5 mM KCN and diluted to an OD600 of 0.05. The NPN dye (10 μM)
was added to the cell suspension in a quartz cuvette and aliquots
of the peptides were added to the cuvette. The fluorescence was recorded
as a function of time at 420 nm (excitation at 350 nm) using an RF-5301PC
spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) until no further increase
in fluorescence was observed. The NPN incorporation into the membrane
after peptide addition increases fluorescence intensity. Percent NPN
uptake was calculated via the following equation: NPN uptake (%) = 
(Fobs – F0)/(F100 – F0) × 100, where Fobs represents
the fluorescence observed at a given peptide concentration, F0 represents the initial fluorescence in the
absence of peptide, and F100 represents
the fluorescence upon addition of polymyxin B (10 μg/mL). The
inner membrane permeabilizing ability of the peptides was determined
by measurement of β-galactosidase activity in E. coli ML-35 cells using the normally impermeable,
chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG), as described previously.56 Briefly, E. coli ML-35 cells
were washed in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) and resuspended in the buffer containing
1.5 mM ONPG and adjusted to an OD600 of 0.05. The rate of inner membrane
permeability was assessed by the hydrolysis of ONPG to ONP determined
by reading the absorbance at 405 nm.

Membrane Depolarization
and Disruption
Membrane depolarization
was detected using a membrane potential-sensitive probe, DiSC3(5),
as described previously.57 Briefly, S. aureus and E. coli grown to the midlogarithmic phase in LB were harvested by centrifugation
(3500 rpm, 7 min) and washed with 5 mM HEPES buffer (100 mM KCl, pH
7.2) containing 20 mM glucose and resuspended in buffer to an OD600
of 0.05. The fluorescence changes resulting from the dissipation of
the cytoplasmic membrane potential by peptides was monitored at excitation/emission
wavelengths = 622 nm/670 nm on the RF-5301 spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu).
The peptides were added to the cells when the fluorescence intensity
had stabilized because of maximal dye uptake by the bacterial membranes.
The complete collapse of membrane potential was achieved by addition
of Gramicidin D (0.25 nM). Membrane disruption was determined by the
release of entrapped calcein from LUVs (large unilamellar vesicles),
as previously described.57 The fluorescence
intensity of the calcein released from the liposomes following peptide
addition was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths = 490 nm/520
nm on a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorometer (Tokyo, Japan). Complete dye
release was obtained after treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100.

LPS-Neutralizing
Activity
LPS neutralization by peptides
was assessed using a commercially available LAL assay kit (Kinetic-QCL
1000; BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. In Gram-negative bacteria, LPS activates a proenzyme
in LAL that catalytically releases a colored product, paranitroanilide
(pNA), from the colorless Ac-Ile-Glu-Ala-Arg-pNA substrate, which
is detected spectrophotometrically at OD410. The peptides
were prepared in the pyrogen-free water and adjusted to pH 7.0 with
1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH. Increasing concentrations of the peptides were
incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with one endotoxin unit. Approximately,
50 μL of LAL reagent was added and incubated for 10 min. After
addition of 100 μL of substrate and further incubation of the
reaction for 6 min, the release of the colored product was recorded
at OD410. Percent LPS neutralization was calculated via
the following equation: LPS neutralization (%) = [(ODblank – ODpeptide)/ODblank] × 100. Water
was used as a negative control that could not neutralize LPS (blank).

TNF-α Release and NO Production in LPS-Stimulated Cells
RAW264.7 cells were grown in 96-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
culture media. After one day, the medium was removed and fresh media
was added to each well. The cells were stimulated with 20 ng/mL LPS
as a positive control, or medium alone as a negative control. The
levels of LPS-induced TNF-α were determined using a mouse TNF-α
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The levels of NO production was also estimated by quantifying
the nitrite accumulation, using Griess reagent (1% sulfanilic acid,
0.1% N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride,
and 5% phosphoric acid) after incubating for 24 h.

Peptide Translocation
The ability of the AMPs and CPP–AMP
conjugates to translocate across lipid bilayers was assessed by fluorescence
transfer from Trp to a dansyl group, as previously described.58 Briefly, LUVs composed of POPC/POPG/DNS-PE (50:45:5)
with entrapped 200 μM chymotrypsin in buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150
mM NaCl, pH 7.2) were prepared by extrusion. The extraliposomal enzyme
was inactivated by adding a trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor to the
suspension. The peptides (2 μM) were added to the suspension
and fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the Trp residues of
the peptides to the dansyl moiety in DNS-PE was employed to investigate
peptide translocation across lipid bilayers. The fluorescence transfer
was monitored at 510 nm (excitation at 280 nm) on using a Shimadzu
RF 5301 PC spectrofluorometer. Internalized peptides into liposomes
can be digested by the enzyme within the liposomes, thus reducing
fluorescence transfer.

Confocal Laser-Scanning Microscopy
E.
coli (KCTC 1682) cells grown to the midlogarithmic
phase were harvested by centrifugation and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered
saline. E. coli cells (1 × 107 CFU/mL) were pretreated with the FITC-labeled peptides (0.2
μM) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer, the bacterial cells were immobilized on a glass
slide and visualized by an Olympus IX 70 confocal laser-scanning microscope
(Tokyo, Japan) with a 488 nm band-pass filter for FITC excitation.

DNA Binding Assay
After purification of plasmid DNA
(pBluescript II SK+) by CsCl density-gradient ultracentrifugation,
gel retardation experiments were performed by mixing 300 ng of the
plasmid DNA with increasing peptide concentrations. The mixture in
20 μL of binding buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM KCl, pH 8.0,
5% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 μg/mL bovine serum albumin,
and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] was incubated at
room temperature for 60 min. After addition of 4 μL of native
loading buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% Ficoll 400, 0.25% bromophenol
blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 50 mM EDTA), an aliquot (20 μL)
was subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in Tris borate–EDTA
buffer (45 mM Trisborate, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA). Migration of DNA
was detected by ethidium bromide fluorescence.
