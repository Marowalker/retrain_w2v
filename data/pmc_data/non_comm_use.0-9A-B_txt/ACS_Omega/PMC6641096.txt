In
the quest to tackle the issue of surface degradation and voltage
decay associated with Li-rich phases, Li-ion conductive Li2ZrO3 (LZO) is coated on Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 (LNMC) by a simple
wet chemical process. The LZO phase coated on LNMC, with a thickness
of about 10 nm, provides a structural integrity and facilitates the
ion pathways throughout the charge–discharge process, which
results in significant improvement of the electrochemical performances.
The surface-modified cathode material exhibits a reversible capacity
of 225 mA h g–1 (at C/5 rate) and retains 85% of
the initial capacity after 100 cycles. Whereas, the uncoated pristine
sample shows a capacity of 234 mA h g–1 and retains
only 57% of the initial capacity under identical conditions. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy reveals that the LZO coating plays a vital
role in stabilizing the interface between the electrode and electrolyte
during cycling; thus, it alleviates material degradation and voltage
fading and ameliorates the electrochemical performance.

Introduction
Lithium-rich phases have been widely investigated
as prospective high-capacity cathode materials for Li-ion batteries
to be used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or electric vehicles.
In particular, the lithium-rich transition metal oxide with the general
formula of xLi2MnO3·(1
– x)LiMO2 (M = Mn, Co, Ni) is a
significant milestone in materials design owing to its well-balanced
capacity/power/cost, which is tailored for high operating voltage
in comparison with the existing state of the art commercial cathode
materials, such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4.1−5 Yet, there are vital snags which impede the commercial progress,
such as (i) large irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle, (ii)
inevitable phase transformation from layered to spinel phase leading
to continuous decay in the discharge capacity,6−9 (iii) oxygen loss from the crystal
lattice which triggers serious safety concerns and low initial Coulombic
efficiency, (iv) structural instability due to Mn dissolution, (v)
voltage decay,10−12 (vi) weak interfacial stability between the electrode
and electrolyte, and (vii) thermal stability. Recently, several strategic
approaches have been attempted to tackle the associated shortcomings
of lithium-rich layered cathodes by adopting procedures such as surface
coating, acid treatment, anion/cation doping,13,14 innovative synthesis method,15,16 substitution of heavy
and bulky elements like Sn, Ti, Mo, and so forth.17,18

All of these techniques have beefed up the commercialization
aspects
of Li-rich layered cathode materials. Among all strategies, surface
modification has proven to be an effective method to surmount the
shortcomings of Li-rich phases. Surface coatings with metal oxides,19−23 metal phosphates,24,25 and metal fluorides26 have thus been pursued to enhance the physical
and chemical properties of lithium-rich cathode materials. Such surface
modification improves the cycling stability, rate capability, and
thermal stability of cathodes, as a result of suppression of oxygen-ion
vacancies in the crystal lattice at the end of the first charge. Further,
surface coating suppresses the undesired electrochemical reactivity
of the electrolyte at the electrode/electrolyte interface by preventing
direct contact between the electrode and electrolyte. However, most
of these coating materials do not favor interfacial charge transfer
of the electrode material; further, they act as a barrier for Li+ conduction and increase the diffusion path length of Li ion,
resulting in inferior rate capability.

To overcome the limitation
of the impeded lithium ion diffusion
through the surface barrier, lithium-ion conducting material has been
introduced as a protective layer on lithium-rich phases. This ion-conducting
layer facilitates lithium-ion transportation between the cathode material
and electrolyte; it also stabilizes their interface at high voltages.27,28 In recent years, Li2ZrO3 (LZO) coating has
gained immense interest for its role in the stability of cathodes.29−31 In this context, Wu et al. have demonstrated a high rate and long
cycle life performance of the LZO-coated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode.32,33

In the present article, we envisage the LZO coating to tackle
specific
issues associated with Li-rich layered phases, such as O2 evolution, reactivity of evolved O2 with the electrolyte,
Mn dissolution, and phase transformation. The monoclinic LZO is structurally
related to the layered Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 (LNMC). Hence, it is anticipated to
enhance the structural integrity owing to an epitaxial relation between
the host cathode and the Li-ion conducting surface layer. This epitaxial
interface may play a beneficial role and effectively separate the
bulk electrode from the electrolyte and stabilize the structure and
the composition during high-voltage cycling. This article reports
a systematic investigation of the role of the Li-ion conducting LZO
surface layer in overcoming the issues with LNMC.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b compare
the X-ray diffraction patterns of bare LNMC and LZO surface-modified
LNMC (LZO @ LNMC). Both the patterns are indexed as hexagonal α-NaFeO2 structures with R3̅m space group. The well-defined splitting of the reflections, (006)/(102)
and (108)/(110), manifests in the crystallization of the layered structure,
without formation of the spinel phase. The weak reflections appearing
between 20 and 30° (2θCu) can be indexed considering
a √3ahex × √3bhex superstructure in the ab 3d metal planes as a result of an ordering between the Li, Ni, Co,
and Mn ions similar to the monoclinic Li2MnO3 structure (represented in the C2/m space group).35,36 The integrated intensity ratio
of the (003) to (104) reflections used for quantification of cation
mixing in the lattice being 1.40, which is greater than 1.2, provides
evidence of the lesser degree of cation mixing in the Li layer, whereas
in the case of the surface-modified pattern, the I(003)/I(104) ratio increases to 1.47.37 This indicates that the degree of cation mixing
depreciates by surface modification. Further, it suggests that there
is no severe change in the host layered structure of LZO @ LNMC, except
for some peaks that are enlarged in the inset of Figure 1b. The peaks marked in “*”
are the characteristics of LZO corresponding to the monoclinic system
with C2/c space
group, which is consistent with the JCPDS card: 01-070-8744. Figure 2 shows the Rietveld
refinement of XRD patterns for surface-modified and pristine material
using Fullprof software. The lattice parameters (a, b, and c) of the surface-modified
sample are same as those of the pristine pattern, suggesting that
the surface coating with LZO does not cause any undue bulk structural
changes. The structural parameters determined by Rietveld refinement
for both pristine and coated samples using R3̅m and C2/m phases are
listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.

FESEM images of bare
and 5 wt % LZO-coated LNMC particles are displayed
in Figure 3a,b. No
significant difference is observed in the morphology and grain size
between pristine and LZO @ LNMC, whereas a closer observation of the
surface reveals the relatively smooth grains for the sample of surface-modified
LZO. EDS has been employed to elucidate the uniform distribution and
analyze the elemental composition of the surface-modified sample.
The atomic ratio
of Ni/Mn/Co/Zr is 15.11:63.4:15.35:6.03, which is in concordance with
that of the targeted composition of the phase, that is, 0.12:0.51:0.12:0.05,
respectively. Elemental mapping in Figure 3d–h of the surface-modified sample
clearly demonstrates the uniform distribution of zirconium element
on the surface.

and (c) EDAX
profile, (d–h) elemental mapping images of 5% LZO-coated sample.

HRTEM studies have been carried
out to acquire further information
pertaining to the interface between the LZO coating and bulk LNMC
material (Figure 4a,b).
Both the figures correspond to high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) images of the rectangle tagged interfacial area
of their inset figures. The images show uniform surface layers of
thickness of around 10 nm. In Figure 4a, the lattice spacings of 4.7 nm for bulk and 4.3
nm for the surface coating are in good concurrence with (003) and
(110) interplanar spacing of isostructural hexagonal LNMC and tetragonal
LZO, which is complemented by the XRD results. The (110) plane of
LZO, oriented along the direction of (003) plane of LNMC shows perfect
epitaxial alignment.

images
showing epitaxial orientation of LZO on LNMC particles.

Similarly, in Figure 4b, the (112) plane of LZO are oriented around
60° with respect
to the (003) plane of the core LNMC lattice. This cross-wire epitaxial
arrangement results in negligible interfacial lattice mismatch {(4.7
– 1.99/cos 60)/4.7 = 15%}. Such a slant epitaxial growth
in the nanoheterostructure is reported for other systems.38,39 The lattice mismatch calculation used here is adopted from the previous
works.38,39 The epitaxial growth with the preferred
orientation and alignment of LZO on LNMC provides structural integrity
and possesses a Li-ion diffusion pathway.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) of Li1s, Ni2p, Co2p, and
Mn2p core levels in the pristine and coated samples have been carried
out to understand the oxidation states of these elements in these
materials. Ni2p, Co2p, Mn3p, Zr3d, O1s, and C1s core-level spectra
are shown in Figure 5. The Li1s peak observed at 55.5 eV (given in Figure S1) in both samples corresponds to Li+ species.40 The Ni2p3/2 peak at 854.6 with the
satellite peak at 860.7 eV is attributed to Ni2+ species.41 Co2p3/2,1/2 peaks at 780 and 794.9
eV, respectively, can be assigned to either Co2+ or Co3+ species. However, the presence of a weak satellite peak
at 789.6 eV related to the 2p3/2 main peak, with a distance
of around 9 eV, explicitly confirms the presence of Co3+ in both of the samples.42,43 Mn2p3/2,1/2 core level peaks at 642.4 and 654.0 eV in the coated and uncoated
samples are assigned to Mn4+ species, respectively.41 Zr3d5/2,3/2 peaks at 182.3 and 184.4
eV in the surface-modified sample shown in Figure 5 are associated with Zr4+ species,
respectively.44 The envelopes of O1s core-level
spectra in both the samples are broad, which are deconvoluted into
three peaks corresponding to the oxide-adsorbed hydroxyl and water
molecules. The main peak at 530.1 eV stands for oxide species, whereas
the higher binding energy peaks at 531.8 and 533.9 eV are related
to OH– and H2O species, respectively.45 The LZO-coated sample shows a relatively large
amount of adsorbed OH– and H2O species
compared to that in the uncoated sample. Similarly, C1s spectra shown
in the figure are broad in nature and can be deconvoluted into several
component peaks. The sharp peak appearing at 284.5 eV corresponds
to adventitious carbon species. The broad peak at 286.5 eV is ascribed
to oxidized carbon species containing C–O bonds. The third
peak at 289.4 eV is assigned to the surface-adsorbed carbonate group.

and Zr3d core levels and deconvoluted O1s and C1s core levels.

The capacity versus voltage profile
for the Li half-cells of the
pristine and 5% LZO @ LNMC cathodes cycling at C/5 current rate in
the potential range of 1.75–4.8 V are shown in Figure 6a. The charge profile is composed
of a sloping region below 4.4 V, followed by a long plateau region
around 4.5 V. Both of the samples show almost the same specific capacity
in the sloping region, which corresponds to the oxidation of the transition
metals, such as Ni2+ to Ni4+ and Co3+ to Co4+. The specific capacity of the plateau region
begins at around 4.5 V, which is accompanied by the extraction of
Li from the 3d metal layer and also the removal of lattice oxygen.
It is to be noted here that the LZO-coated cathode exhibits a lower
amplitude in the plateau region. This difference in capacity
is speculated to be attributed to the slump in the oxygen loss from
the lattice. The pristine Li-rich NMC exhibits an initial charge capacity
of 329 mA h g–1, whereas the 5% LZO-coated LNMC
shows initial charge capacity of 306 mA h g–1, part
of this decrease in capacity is also attributed to the presence of
5% (in weight) electrochemically inactive LZO in the electrode material.
The bare LNMC exhibits a discharge capacity of 234, with 95 mA h g–1 of irreversibility, whereas the 5% surface-modified
sample exhibits an initial capacity of 225 mA h g–1, with 80 mA h g–1 irreversibility. This decrease
in irreversible capacity is mainly attributed to the suppression of
solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) formation by the LZO surface barrier.

5% LZO @ LNMC, (b) cycling performance of bare and 5% LZO @ LNMC,

profiles at C/5 rate, and (e) corresponding differential capacity
curves of the pristine and 5% LZO @ LNMC samples in the voltage range
of 1.75–4.8 V.

To evaluate the effect of the LZO coating on LNMC, charge–discharge
cycles have been conducted continuously at a current rate of C/5 between
1.75 and 4.8 V. Figure 6b shows the cycle number versus specific discharge capacity for pristine
LNMC and LZO-coated LNMC samples. The surface-modified cathode shows
a superior retention of 85% after 100 cycles. In contrast, the bare
sample shows a rapid decline in the specific discharge capacity, with
retention of 57% after 100 cycles under identical conditions. The
rate capability test has been carried out for both the samples at
different current rates. It can be seen from Figure 6c that the LZO surface-modified cathode delivers
excellent discharge capacities of 225, 196, 160, 100, and 55 mA h
g–1 at C/5, C/2, 1C, 2C, and 3C rates, respectively.
On the other hand, the pristine material delivers 234, 170, 125, 60,
and 30 mA h g–1 at C/5, C/2, 1C, 2C, and 3C rates,
respectively. This large difference in rate performance is mainly
attributed to the existence of fast lithium-ion diffusion pathway
in the LZO surface barrier.

The comparison of the discharge
voltage profile as a function of
the cycle numbers for pristine and LZO surface-modified LNMC is displayed
in Figure 6d. There
is an abrupt decline in the discharge capacity as well as voltage
fading for uncoated LNMC due to the surface deterioration owing to
the side reactions at the electrode and electrolyte interface.46,47 On the other hand, the surface-modified cathode exhibits a fairly
stable discharge capacity and comparatively lower voltage decay. The
differential capacity (dQ/dV) plots
of both materials are shown in Figure 6e. The comparison of the dQ/dV plots gives a better understanding of voltage fading. The peak seen
in the dQ/dV plot above 4 V corresponds
to reduction of Ni4+/Ni2+, the peak around 3.7
V corresponds to Co4+/Co3+, and the peak below
3.5 V is ascribed to the reduction of Mn4+ and of oxygen.48,49 The uncoated LNMC shows that the peaks below 3.5 V correspond to
Mn reduction shifting toward lower potential, also a new peak starts
to evolve at lower potential. This voltage hysteresis is attributed
to the gradual accumulation of spinel environment in the crystal structure.
The layered to spinel phase transformation is attributed to decrease
in the Mn content in the structure due to dissolution.6,8 In contrast, the structural integrity between LZO coating and the
surface of cathode impede the diffusion of Mn and hence limit the
layered to spinel phase transformation.

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed
to elucidate the improved performance of the surface-modified cathode. Figure 7a,b displays the
Nyquist plots for fresh electrode and cycled electrode at various
cycles of pristine and LZO-coated LNMC half-cells. The inflated high
frequency region of Figure 7a,b are shown in Figure 7c,d respectively. As seen from the plots, the semicircle
in the mid frequency region is merged with that of the high frequency
region. This indicates the overlapping of the SEI layer resistance
and charge-transfer resistance. The sloping region at low frequencies
represents the Warburg resistance, which is attributed to Li+ diffusion through the bulk electrode. The EIS data have been simulated
by Zsimpwin software using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset
of Figure 7a. In the
equivalent circuit, Rs represents the
solution resistance, Rsl is the resistance
of the SEI layer, Rct is the charge-transfer
resistance, W represents the Warburg resistance,
and CPE1 and CPE2 represent the double layer capacitance and capacitance
of the passivation film, respectively. The values of Rs, Rsl, and Rct obtained from the simulation of EIS data are depicted
in Table S3. The solution resistance (Rs) is negligible and almost same for all of
the samples. Rct value of the pristine
electrode before cycling is 196.5 Ω, and it drastically increases
to 1396 Ω after 80 cycles. The reason for such a significant
hike in the charge-transfer resistance is attributed to the undesirable
reaction between electrode/electrolyte ensuing a slump in surface
charge transfer, which is confirmed by increasing the SEI layer resistance
(Rsl) from 324.2 to 809.7 Ω after
80 cycles. The charge-transfer resistance of the LZO-coated sample
before cycling is 379.7 Ω, which is higher compared to that
of the uncoated sample probably because of the presence of surface-adsorbed
species, which are revealed from the XPS and also IR studies (Figure S2). The adsorbed species are removed
during the first charge, resulting in drop of the Rct value to 121.3 Ω. The Rct and Rsl values together increase
as a function of cycles but the increasing trend is much lower than
that of the pristine sample. The increase in Rsl and Rct in the uncoated sample
correlates well with the capacity fading observed during cycling.
The loss of lithium content is attributed to the formation of undesirable
SEI on the surface. On the contrary, the electrochemically passive
LZO surface barrier provides greater benefits by protecting the active
sites on the surface of LNMC from acidic electrolyte, induced with
oxygen at high voltage. Also, the Li+ conducting surface
layer facilitates diffusion of lithium and hence a better rate performance.

d) their corresponding enlarged plots, respectively; (e, f) plots
of the real part of impedance [Z] as a function of
the inverse square root of the angular frequency [ω–1/2].

In addition, lithium-ion diffusion
coefficients for both LNMC and
LZO @ LNMC have also been explored from the same set of EIS data using
the following equations50 1  where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, A is the
area of the electrode, n is the number of electrons
per molecule during charge–discharge process, F is the Faraday constant, C is the concentration
of Li+ per unit cell and σ is the Warburg factor,
which is obtained by linear fitting of the inclined lines at low frequencies,
depicted in Figure 7e,f, and it has a relationship with Z (ω =
2πf), as shown in eq 2. 2  The calculated diffusion
coefficient values
are plotted in Figure 8. Before cycling, the pristine sample shows a diffusion coefficient
of 23.77 × 10–16, whereas that for the surface-modified
electrode is 22.18 × 10–16. After the first
cycle, DLi+ values of both
the pristine and surface-coated material are reduced to 12.90 ×
10–16 and 15.45 × 10–16,
respectively. This decrease in the diffusion coefficient is attributed
to the structural rearrangement after charge. In contrast, the decreasing
diffusivity coefficient in the surface-coated sample is comparatively
low due to suppression of oxygen evolution during the first charge.
Upon further cycling, the pristine sample shows that the rate of Li+ diffusion drastically decreases with the increasing cycle
number (10.02 × 10–16, 58.83 × 10–17, and 42.97 × 10–17 for the
20th, 40th, and 80th cycle, respectively), whereas in the case of
the surface-modified sample it is almost constant (12.95 × 10–16, 12.47 × 10–16, and 13.60
× 10–16 for the 20th, 40th, and 80th cycle,
respectively). Incidentally, the decreasing DLi+ in LNMC coincides with the capacity degradation
(Figure 6b) as well
as spinel phase transformation (Figure 6e), which is observed as a function of the cycle number.
In contrast, the almost constant value of DLi+ for the surface-modified sample is in accordance with
the capacity retention and mitigation of phase transformation.

To demonstrate the structural integrity of the surface-modified
cathode, HRTEM investigation of the electrode material has been conducted
after the completion of 100 cycles (Figure 9). The microscopic results confirm that the
LZO coating is neither pulverized nor detached from the surface of
the core active material (LNMC). The intactness after the prolonged
cycle is attributed to the structural integrity that persists between
LZO and LNMC, which is responsible for the improved performance. In
summary, the strategy of LZO coating on the surface of LNMC can play
a significant positive role and pave the way for commercial realization
of Li-rich cathode materials as high-capacity electrodes.

Conclusions
A facile approach to
prepare a uniform coating of a Li-ion conducting
LZO surface layer over a high-capacity LNMC cathode is reported in
the present study. The growth of LZO with the preferred orientation
and alignment on LNMC provides a new strategy to design a robust surface
coating, which can possess an ion pathway and thereby enhance the
initial Coulombic efficiency and rate performances. This is mainly
attributed to (a) the protective role of Li-ion conductive surface
barrier between the bulk electrode and electrolyte and (b) improved
Li+ migration facilitating lithium diffusion pathways on
the surface of the cathode. The intactness of the surface coating
significantly suppresses the layered to spinel structural transformation
and consequently inhibits the voltage decay. Most importantly, the
dissolution of Mn from the bulk cathode into the electrolyte is also
drastically mitigated. The surface modification strategy proposed
here broadens the scope of further investigation on lithium-rich phases
toward commercialization aspects and triggers new insights into the
inhabitation of O2 evolution at high voltage and safety
concerns of high capacity electrodes.

Experimental Section
The LZO-coated LNMC sample was prepared by a two step procedure
as follows. In the first step, nanocrystalline LNMC was synthesized
using a solution combustion process, as reported in our previous publication.34 The surface modification of solution combustion-synthesized
LNMC with LZO was carried out as follows. Stoichiometric amounts of
LiOH·H2O dissolved in methanol and Zr[O(CH2)3CH3]4 dissolved in carbon tetrachloride
were mixed together, in which the nanocrystalline LNMC was added.
The solution was kept for constant stirring at room temperature for
6 h. Then, a few drops of deionized water were added into the suspension
to undergo hydrolysis reaction. The stirring was maintained for another
6 h, followed by gently heating at 60 °C to evaporate the complete
solvent. The powder was then heated at 600 °C for 5 h. Hereafter,
we refer to the sample, Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 as Li-rich NMC (LNMC) and Li2ZrO3-coated Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2 as LZO @ LNMC. The phase characterization
of these materials was primarily carried out by X-ray diffraction
with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer, using a Cu Kα radiation
(α1 = 1.54056 Å, α2 = 1.54439
Å). The morphology and size of the powder samples were obtained
using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM MIRA3 LMU).
HRTEM studies were carried out with a Tecnai-G2 F20 microscope.

XPS of these samples were recorded with a Thermo Fisher Scientific
Multilab 2000 spectrometer fitted with nonmonochromatic Al Kα
radiation (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source operated at a power of 150
W (12.5 mA, 12 kV). The reported binding energies were corrected with
reference to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV. For XPS analysis, powder samples
were pelletized to 8 mm diameter, which were mounted on the sample
holders and placed in the load-lock chamber in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)
at 8 × 10–8 mbar for 5 h to desorb any volatile
species absorbed on the surface. After 5 h, the samples were introduced
one by one inside the analyzer chamber, with UHV at 5 × 10–10 mbar. All of the spectra were recorded with pass
energy of 40 eV and step increment of 0.05 eV. Infrared spectra were
obtained using the FTIR spectrometer, Bruker Optick GmbH, using KBr
pressed disk.

Electrochemical experiments were conducted on
swagelok-type Li
half-cells constructed in an argon-filled glovebox. The positive electrode
was formulated with the ball-milled mixture at an 80:20 weight ratio
of the active material and Super-P Li Carbon (Timcal Belgium). The
lithium metal disc was used as a negative as well as reference electrode.
The Whatman glass microfiber filter paper acted as a separator. The
1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of diethyl carbonate,
dimethyl carbonate, and ethylene carbonate (2:1:2 ratio by volume)
was used as the electrolyte. In a typical experiment, the cathode
loading was 4–6 mg per cell. The galvanostatic cycling experiments
were carried out at room temperature at C/5 rate, where C represents
the theoretical exchange of 1 mol of lithium per formula unit in 1
h. The cells were cycled between the potential window of 1.75 and
4.8 V using a VMP3Z biologic multichannel potentiostat/galvanostat.
