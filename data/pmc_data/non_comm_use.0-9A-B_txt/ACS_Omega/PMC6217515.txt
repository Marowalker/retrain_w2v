Three π-extended anthracene-bearing
thioacetals (1–3) have been synthesized, and their
fluorescence “turn-on” responses to
Hg2+ ions are studied. The chemodosimetric
fluorescence-sensing behavior and their resulting hydrolysis via a
desulfurization reaction mechanism leads to the formation of highly
fluorescent respective aldehyde substitutions. Furthermore, this mechanism
was supported by increase in the quantum yields of their resulting
aldehydes and is correlated to their molecular substitution. The chemosensors 1–3 have exhibited to be promising receptors toward
Hg2+ ions in the presence of other competitive metal ions.
Moreover, the detection limits of 1–3 have been
found to be in the nanomolar range (94, 59, and 235, respectively).
Fluorescence microscopic imaging studies show that 1–2 have been found to be effective for fluorescence imaging in live
cells. Moreover, compounds 1–3 act as potential
candidates for the detection of Hg2+ in environmental and
biological systems as well as real samples.

Introduction
The selective detection
of toxic metal ions (heavy metals) has
been receiving much attention because of their effect on health and
the environment.1 Recent results from the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the International Agency
for Research show that the heavy metals cause cancer and are called
as carcinogens.2 Among all other heavy
metal ions, mercury is more toxic even when present in small quantities,
and it has engendered not only from geological events but also from
human activities.3 There are serious health
problems associated with mercury pollution, as it can reach the vital
organs of humans in several ways and leads to deadly diseases such
as acrodynia (pinks disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and Minamata
disease. Moreover, mercury forms strong complexes with sulfur-containing
biomolecules and leads to the malfunction of proteins and enzymes.
Consequently, it results in a wide variety of diseases related to
the kidney, brain, and central nervous system damage.4 Thus, selective and sensitive on-site recognition of mercury
ions is crucial in environmental protection and health monitoring.
Several traditional analytical methods are available for the identification
and detection of Hg2+ ions and they include atomic absorption
spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy, molecular absorption
spectroscopy, and electroanalytical techniques. Nevertheless, these
sophisticated instrumental methods often involve significant sample
preparation and expensive laboratory-based instrumentation.5 Recently, fluorescence spectroscopic methods
have gained much interest because of better sensitivity, response,
and ease in sample preparation.6

Numerous findings have been reported on the fluorogenic response-based
detection of Hg2+ ions by employing important strategies
such as complexation,7 xanthene ring opening,8 desulfurization,9 cyclization,10 Hg2+-promoted deprotection of thioacetals,11a−11d use of chemodosimeters,11e,11f and so on. It is known
that the synthesis of thioacetals occurs via protection of aldehydes
or ketones by thiols and deprotection could be achieved only upon
addition of Hg2+ ions. Therefore, this type of reactions
might be employed for selective detection of Hg2+ ions.
Aldehyde is well known as a strong electron-withdrawing group, which
once protected by alkyl thioacetal groups forms moieties that might
be regarded as electron donors. Hence, the selective and ratiometric
luminescent probe for Hg2+ could be achieved by deprotection
of the thioacetal, by using intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) or
photon-induced electron transfer (PET) as a signaling tool, in which
the fluorophore unit would act as the electron donor, whereas the
aldehyde group might be the electron acceptor. As expected, the addition
of Hg2+ ions to thioacetal leads to deprotection and subsequently,
the electronic properties of the product and reactant are changed.
This leads to the change in the ICT or PET process before and after
the deprotection of thioacetals, resulting in a change of fluorescence
emission. On the basis of this phenomenon, several colorimetric or
fluorometric chemosensors for Hg2+ have been developed
including thioacetal derivatives of triphenylamine,12 coumarins,13 perylene diimide,14 boron-dipyrromethene,15 tetraphenylethylene,16 and 1,8-naphthalimide.17 However, π-extended anthracene thioacetal-based
chemosensors for Hg2+ are rarely reported in the literature.
Here, taking advantage of the fluorescence behavior of anthracene
three new anthracene-containing thioacetals have been designed, 1–3, obtained from the reaction of aldehydes (4–6) (which emit green luminescence upon excitation)
with ethanethiol in the presence of Lewis acid. These innovative anthracene-containing
thioacetals are shown to be selective chemodosimeters for Hg2+ in a tetrahydrofuran (THF)/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1:1,
v/v, pH 7.4) solution and in living cells. These new probes show bright
emission after the addition of an aqueous solution of Hg2+ ions and it is also complemented by an enhanced fluorescence color
change. These changes are noticeable by the naked eyes under normal
illumination. Moreover, these new probes are found as exceedingly
selective and sensitive receptors for Hg2+ ions, even in
the presence of competitive metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The synthetic scheme
for compounds 1–6 is shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 4–6 are synthesized by the Sonogashira cross-coupling
reaction18 between the bromo derivatives
of anthracene and 4-ethynyl benzaldehyde (72–80%). Compounds 1–3 have been obtained from 4–6 via Lewis acid19-catalyzed thioacetal
formation, respectively (70–79%). This synthetic route is found
to be much easier with a simple method of purification and is reliable
for large-scale production of target compounds. Compounds 1–6 are characterized using 1H, 13C NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS). Furthermore, compound 5 has
been structurally confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction (Figure 1). The parameters
associated with the crystal data are shown in Table S1.

Photophysical Properties
The optical studies of freshly
prepared compounds 1–3 are performed in THF/PBS
(1:1, v/v, pH 7.4) buffer and they are shown in Figure 2. Compounds 1–3 have
displayed two major absorption events in the region of 390 to 445
nm, whereas emission bands are identified in the span of ∼430–515 nm (Table 1 and Figure 2). The absorbance and luminescence bands of 2 have exhibited
a significant red shift compared to 1 and 3, owing to the presence of two acetylene units, which lead to increase
its conjugation. However, the emission intensity and quantum yield
of 2 (3%) have been found to be very weak compared to 1 (20%) and 3 (10%). It might be due to the PET
process from the thioacetal to the fluorophore (anthracene) as well
as flexibility around the thioacetal moiety. Hence, the increase in
the flexibility and heavy metal content in the molecular systems leads
to decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield.

Absorption and Fluorescence
Studies of 1–3 toward Various Metal Ions
To gain quantitative insights
into the sensitivity and selectivity of freshly prepared compounds 1–3 toward Hg2+ ions, UV–vis absorption
and fluorescence studies have been performed in THF/PBS buffer (1:1,
v/v, pH 7.4) (Table 1). Upon addition of Hg2+ ions to 1–3, rational changes have been observed in the absorption bands. The
absorption bands of 1–3 at 390, 415, and 400 nm
have gradually increased and they have displayed a slight shift to
the bathochromic region. It indicates that the Hg2+ ions
are tangling the thioacetal moieties and convert them into formyl
groups. The saturation of 1–3 is reached upon
the addition of only two equivalents for 1 or 3 and three equivalents for 2 of Hg2+ ions.
However, the absorption profiles of 1–3 show similar
behavior compared to their precursors 4–6 upon
the addition of excess Hg2+ ions, by evidencing strongly
that the dithioacetal in 1–3 has been completely
transformed into aldehyde in the presence of Hg2+ ions.

As mentioned earlier, compounds 1–3 have displayed
weak fluorescence because of the presence of a heavy atom effect as
well as the PET process that occurred from the dithiane (sulfur atom)
to the π-anthracene group. However, the fluorescence intensity
has been gradually enhanced by addition of Hg2+ with a
1:1 ratio of THF and PBS buffer solution of 1–3. For example, the weak fluorescence emission of 1 at
455 nm has been gradually enhanced and simultaneously was red-shifted
to appear at 460 nm (a twofold intensity increment). It reaches saturation
when 2.0 equiv of Hg2+ is added. The new bright fluorescent
emission at 460 nm indicates a new species formation such as the aldehyde.
Similarly, compound 2 has exhibited very weak emission
at 515 nm and showed strong bright green emission at 530 nm (10-fold
intensity increment) upon addition of Hg2+ ions (Figure 3). However, 3 has shown minimal changes in emission intensity, after addition
of Hg2+ and it has been attributed to the heavy atom effect
of bromine (heavy atom effect dominated by PET).

Figure 3 Fluorescent spectral
changes associated with 2 (1
μM) after successive addition of Hg2+ ions in THF/PBS
buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.4) (λex = 400 nm).

Moreover, good agreement with linear fitting is
observed between
the concentration of Hg2+ ions (0–2.5 μM)
and the luminescence intensity (SI), and it enables to quantify the
relevant concentration of Hg2+ via compounds 1–3. Furthermore, the detection limits of 1–3 toward Hg2+ are found to be 9.5 ×
10–8, 5.9 × 10–8, and 23.5
× 10–8 M, respectively20 by using the well-known equation, LOD = 3 SD/slope, and the limit
of quantification has been obtained using the equation, LOQ = 10 SD/slope,
where SD is the standard deviation from the blank measurement and
the slope is obtained from the calibration curve of the standard (Table S2). The detection limit of 2 is found to be much lower compared to the literature reports, whereas
other two probes (1 and 3) have shown similar
detection limits in accordance with the observations noted for Hg2+ reported elsewhere20 (Table S3).

Furthermore, the fluorescence
responses of 1–3 have been investigated toward
various metal ions and compared with
Hg2+ ions (Figure 4). Solutions of 1–3 (1 μM) in THF/PBS
buffer (1:1, v/v, pH 7.4) are treated with 20 equiv and more of several
different metal ions such as Na+, K+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Al3+, and
Cd2+ for the investigation of selectivity. Probes 1–3 have displayed high selectivity toward Hg2+ ions, whereas there is no change in luminescence emission bands,
even after the addition of excess amount of other metal ions. However,
a very small increment has been observed in fluorescence intensity,
when 20 equiv of Ag+ is added to 1–3. It might be due to the interaction of thioacetal moiety and Ag+ induces emission enhancement. Moreover, the coordination
of Ag+ ion with thioacetal moiety of 1–3 prevents the PET quenching process and it leads to restoration
of emission.21 Further, the fluorescence
responses of 1–3 have been examined
toward the addition of Hg2+ ions in the presence of various
potentially competing species, for example, Na+, K+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Al3+, and Cd2+. Probes 1–3 are
moderately interacting with 20 equiv of Ag+, whereas the
initial fluorescence intensities of 1–3 are not changed upon the addition of 20 equiv and more of different
other metal ions (Figure 4). However, subsequently, the addition of 2 equiv or 3 equiv
of Hg2+ ions solution has elicited a prominent fluorescence
enhancement, which further has demonstrated that compounds 1–3 have shown exceptional selectivity for Hg2+ ions in the
presence of other abovementioned competing species. Notably, the enhanced
fluorescence response renders compounds 1–3 as selective and sensitive receptors for Hg2+ via simple visual-eye investigation even in the presence of various
other metal analytes. Thus, the present absorption and fluorescence
studies clearly demonstrate that 1–3 might be applicable as selective fluorescence “turn-on” chemodosimeters for Hg2+ ions over other biologically
important metal ions.

(1:1,
v/v, pH 7.4) in the absence or presence of 20 equiv of Na+, K+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Al3+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ (λex = 400 nm). Inset: Digital photograph of 2 (10

portable UV lamp at 365 nm (left). Fluorescence enhancement (F/F0) at 495 nm of 2 (1 μM) toward various metal ions with Hg2+ (20
μM) and other metals only (40 μM) (right).

To evaluate the fluorescence changes with respect
to time, the
study of 1 μM 1 or 2 has been carried
out in the presence of Hg2+ ions at different time intervals.
The results reveal that the total fluorescence intensity gain of 1 and 2 has been achieved toward Hg2+ in less time, merely 5 min by indicating that these probes are applicable
to real-time monitoring of Hg2+ (Supporting Information). Moreover, for efficient detection of biologically
important metal ions in a biological system, the sensor should work
in the range of biological pH. The emission profiles of compounds 1 and 2 are found invariant with respect to any
change in pH (3.0–10), thus promising for the recognition of
Hg2+ ions in biological samples (Supporting Information).22

In order to
evaluate the structural aspects along with the sensing
mechanism of probes 1–3 with Hg2+ ions, 1H NMR titration experiments are performed in the presence
and absence of Hg2+ in DMSO-d6 and they have provided quick evidence. By the addition of 2 equiv
of Hg2+ ions with 1, the representative proton
signal consistent to methine proton of the thioacetal group has exclusively
disappeared at 4.98 ppm, along with the appearance of a new signal
at 10.36 ppm, which is assigned for the −CHO group (Supporting Information). Similar behavior has
been observed for other two probes (2–3) with
Hg2+ ions. On the basis of these results, it is strongly
believed that the successful deprotection reaction of probes 1–3 has been triggered by Hg2+ ions. Furthermore,
the HRMS spectral analysis of 1–3 has displayed
molecular ion peaks at m/z = 413.1330,
649.2066, and 493.0464, respectively, and by the addition of excess
Hg2+ ions, they are changed to m/z = 307.1117, 435.1370, and 385.0304. This is same as for 4–6 (Figures S7–S10, Supporting Information) and it confirms the deprotection of thiols in
the presence Hg2+ ions, by producing free aldehyde groups
with bright luminescence.

To get insight into the changes in
photophysical properties of 1–3 before and after
the addition of Hg2+ ions, the density functional theory
(DFT) calculations are accomplished
with the B3LYP-6-311G basis set by using the Gaussian 03 program.23 The frontier molecular orbitals of 1–3 are mainly localized on the π-conjugated anthracene unit.
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of compound 1 is localized on the anthracene unit, whereas the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) spreads over the aldehyde units. It gives
a strong evidence of enhancement in fluorescence via the ICT process
[π-conjugated (anthracene) unit to −CHO] upon the addition
of Hg2+ ions. On the other hand, a DFT study of 2 shows that the HOMO and LUMO are localized only on the π moiety
of anthracene unit and hence, the enhancement of fluorescence occurs
via the absence of PET upon the addition of Hg2+ ions.
From these studies, one can tentatively conclude that the emission
enrichment in 1 occurs via ICT over PET, whereas it occurs
in 2 via the absence of PET.

Additionally, to evaluate
the recognition of Hg2+ in
biological cellular media by using synthesized probes 1 and 2, fluorescence cellular imaging has been performed
in PBS containing 20% DMSO. First, HeLa cells are incubated with 10
μM of probes 1 or 2 in PBS for 30
min at 37 °C, and are found to be nonfluorescent (Figure 5). However, upon the addition
of Hg2+ ions with the cells preloaded with 1 and 2, the entire cells have displayed exceptional
green luminescence enrichment in the intracellular area. These bioimaging
experiments of 1 and 2 have provided valuable
information not only about cell permeability and biocompatibility
but also the effectiveness of the probes for cellular imaging. On
the basis of these results, one can conclude that probe 1 or 2 is a promising and successful chemodosimeter for
Hg2+ ions in living organisms.

Conclusions
In
summary, rationally designed anthracene-based thioacetals have
been synthesized and their luminescence chemosensory behaviors are
studied toward Hg2+ ions. Probes 1–3 are proven to possess excellent selectivity and sensitivity and
as luminescent “turn-on” probes for
the recognition of Hg2+ ions over various metal ions. Compound 2 demonstrates faster (less than 5 min) “turn-on” fluorescence response and it is found to have very low limit
of detection toward Hg2+ ions than 1 in THF/PBS
(1:1, v/v, pH 7.4) buffer media. The fluorescence intensities of 1–2 do not vary even in the wide range of pH (3–10)
and thus, they could be useful for the recognition of Hg2+ in a biological cellular medium. Probes 1–2 have
proved to be biocompatible and successful for intracellular fluorescence
imaging of Hg2+ ion, and they lead to potential applications
in biology.

Experimental Section
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals
and solvents were purchased
from commercial sources and used without further purification. Reactions
were carried out using oven-dried glassware. Flash chromatography
was carried out on Merck Kieselgel 60 (230–400 mesh) as the
stationary phase under a positive pressure using AR grade solvents;
the procedure includes removal of solvents under reduced pressure.
Thin-layer chromatography was performed on precoated Merck Kieselgel
silica gel plates (60 F254, Merck, Germany) monitored by UV light
and Iodine. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded
on Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometers. Chemical shifts for 1H and 13C NMR are referenced to the residual solvent resonance
and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) from high
to low frequency. J-values are reported for 1H NMR coupling constants in the unit of hertz (Hz). The residual
solvent signals were used as references and the chemical shifts were
converted to the TMS (tetramethylsilane) scale: CDCl3:
δH = 7.26 ppm, δC = 77.16 ppm, DMSO-d6: δH = 2.50 ppm, δC = 39.51 ppm. The following abbreviations or combinations
thereof were used to explain the multiplicities: s = singlet, d =
doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, qu = quintet, m = multiplet, br
= broad. High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
was performed with a Water Micromass LCT Premier instrument. The single
crystals were mounted on a Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer (5) and data were collected using graphite-monochromatized
Mo Kα-radiation (Å = 0.71073) at 293 K (5).
The following programs were used for data collection and reduction:Nonius
1997 Collect, HKLDENZO, and Scalepack.24 The structures were solved by direct methods using the program package
maXus and refined in the usual way using SHELXL97.25 Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically and hydrogen
atoms isotropically. CCDC: 1842083
