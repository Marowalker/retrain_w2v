The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)
is a potential alternative
to the widely used Si-based solar cell, with several advantages including
higher energy conversion efficiency under weak and indirect illumination
conditions, and the possibility of practical application in urban
life due to their exterior characteristics. However, despite these
advantages, the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs has remained
low at ∼10%. To improve the efficiency of DSSCs, research has
been done on modifying the materials used in DSSC component parts,
such as the photoanode, electrolyte, and counter electrode. Another
approach is to modify the photoanode to increase the diffusion coefficient,
reduce the recombination rate, and enhance the light behavior. One
of the most popular methods for improving the efficiency of DSSCs
is by trapping and dispersing the incident light using a scattering
layer. Use of a scattering layer has shown various and interesting
results, depending on the application, but it is currently used only
in a simple form and there has been no deep research on the further
potential of the scattering layer. In this study, the scattering center
was introduced to maximize the effect of scattering. Light distribution
near the scattering center, within or on the photoanode, was investigated
using finite differential time domain (FDTD) numerical methods. Based
on the FDTD analysis, an optimized, dome-shaped three-dimensional
modified structure of a transparent photoanode with minimized scattering
centers was introduced and indicated the possibility of modifying
the photon distribution in the photoanode to enhance the performance
of DSSCs. In addition to using the scattering center, we have introduced
the structure of the dome-shaped three-dimensional structure to utilize
the light distribution within the photoanode. This novel three-dimensional
transparent photoanode and scattering center design increased the
energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs from 6.3 to 7.2%. These results
provide a foundation for investigating the role of the scattering
center via further in-depth research. This new three-dimensional photoanode
design provides a means to overcome the previous limitations on DSSC
performance.

Introduction
The dye-sensitized
solar cell (DSSC) has been developed as an affordable
photovoltaic device that possesses several advantages over the widely
used Si-based solar cell, including higher energy conversion efficiency
under weak and indirect illumination conditions.1−3 These advantages
can compensate for the weaknesses of Si-based solar cells, especially
in practical applications in urban life. Additionally, DSSCs can be
fabricated as flexible photovoltaic modules with various colors, suitable
for building-integrated photovoltaics or electronic-integrated photovoltaics.4,5 Despite these advantages, the energy conversion efficiency of DSSCs
at 1 sun, 1.5 AM has remained at ∼10%, whereas that of rival
technologies has increased in recent times.

In fact, there have
been many efforts to increase the efficiency
of DSSCs, including modifications to the photon-absorbing dye and
the development of new electrolytes and counter electrodes.6−19 One method has been the modification of the photoanode, which consists
of a nanoporous TiO2 film stained with a dye. The modifications
have been aimed at increasing the diffusion coefficient of electrons,
reducing the recombination rate, and enhancing light trapping. Among
these, modification of the light distribution within the photoanode
can serve as a basis for further studies. Thus, much effort has been
devoted to achieving a more efficient photon distribution, in terms
of energy conversion. These efforts include inserting a scattering
layer on or within the photoanode, introducing photonic crystal structures,
and inducing patterns.19−28

The use of a scattering layer has become the most popular
method
to trap light moving within the photoanode, and then disperse it within
the photoanode; this allows easy modification of the light distribution
via a process suitable for mass production. As a result, several optimized
photoanode structures have been suggested, including a scattering
layer deposited on the transparent photoanode to induce scattered
light back into the photoanode, and a scattering center, generally
larger TiO2 particles, within the photoanode to disperse
incident light near the scattering center and prevent it passing the
electrode.29,30 However, to date, the role of
scattering layers has been considered from a qualitative rather than
quantitative perspective. As a result, the application of scattering
layers remains limited and their full potential has not yet been studied
in depth.

In this study, light distribution modifications made
near the scattering
center within or on the photoanode were reinvestigated using finite
differential time domain (FDTD) numerical methods to show the effect
of a scattering layer or a scattering center on the light distribution
of photoanodes in DSSCs. Additionally, based on the simulated results,
three-dimensionally modified photoanode structures were developed
to enhance the performance of DSSCs. The proposed structures were
fabricated by a repeated screen printing process, using transparent
and semitransparent TiO2 photoanodes prepared by mixing
transparent photoanode paste with light-scattering particles. This
process is actually similar to a previous photoanode preparation process
attempted for mass production, so can be used without modification.

Results
and Discussion
The concentration of electrons generated by
incident photons within
a DSSC photoanode and, thus, the electrical behavior of the photoanode,
can be estimated by a combination of diffusion, generation, and recombination,
according to the electron continuity equation, eq 1(31−33) 1  where n is the concentration
of electrons, n0 is the concentration
of electrons at the substrate and electrode, k is
the recombination rate, G(x) is
the generation rate, which is the gradient of light intensity, and D is the diffusivity of electrons within the electrode.
As shown in this equation, G(x)
can be expressed as λI(x),
where λ is the absorption coefficient of the electrode and I(x) is the light intensity, when it follows
the Beer–Lambert law. Thus, the light intensity acts as source
form in the linear differential equation, playing an important role
in the determination of electron density and, therefore, in the performance
of the electrode. Thus, to investigate the effect of light scattering,
the light distribution near the scattering center should be considered.

The light intensity distribution near the scattering center, calculated
by FDTD numerical methods, is shown in Figure 1a for various wavelengths corresponding to
violet, green, and red, and for TiO2 particles ranging
in size from 100 to 500 nm. For particles with a size finer than 50
nm, the effect of scattering is very weak (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1, for the cases of 50 and 20 nm). It
is known that a shorter wavelength induces a wider and more severe
scattering effect. Additionally, particle size greatly affects light
distribution near the scattering center. The light intensity distribution
is longitudinal when the particles become larger, as expected in Mie
scattering. Furthermore, the shape of the particle also affects the
scattered light intensity distribution (Figure 1b). By looking in more detail at cases with
two differently oriented ellipsoids of the same size, it could be
seen that the cross-sectional area intersecting the incident plane
wave affects the scattered intensity. Considering the modification
of light distribution by scattering, larger particles are more effective.
However, larger particles occupy more volume, without producing electron
generation during the operation of DSSCs. Thus, despite effective
scattering of light, locating larger particles within the photoanode
is not suitable. Instead, larger particles can operate more effectively
when positioned outside of the photoanode, in terms of gathering light
passing through into the photoanode.

Figure 1 (a) Light intensity derived from finite
differential time domain
(FDTD) simulation results near the single TiO2 particle
in the electrolyte (refractive index = 1.4) according to TiO2 particle size and incident wavelength. (b) Light intensity near
TiO2 particle of 200 nm size with different shapes including
cube (left), vertical ellipsoid (middle), and lateral (right) at 500
nm incident wavelength. The incident intensity of incident light is
set as unity with p-polarization and upper part of the domain is set
as perfectly matched layer and the domain size is 2 μm ×
2 μm.

The effect of particle
size on photon distribution, for the photoanode
on which the scattering particles are located, is shown in Figure 2. The model consists
of three parts (Figure 2a): a glass substrate, a photoanode, and an electrolyte. If there
is no scattering layer and the photon is absorbed in the photoanode,
the light incident to the glass substrate decays vertically and exponentially
according to the Beer–Lambert law, thus providing a one-dimensional
photon distribution (Figure 2b).31,32 When large (500 nm) TiO2 particles are deposited on the photoanode in a single layer, the
light scattered by the large particles is propagated to both the electrolyte
and photoanode, as shown in Figure 2c. As the number of scattering particle layers increases,
the photons propagated into the electrolyte may rescatter. The scattering
layer on the photoanodes modifies the photon distribution in the electrode,
so that the light intensity in the deep region of the electrode increases.
Small particles (200 nm) also increase light intensity at the photoanode
(Figure 2d). Considering
the effect of particle size, larger particles allow for a more effective
scattered photon distribution when the scattering layer is located
on the top of the photoanode. This corresponds well with the results
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 2 (a) Model
for the calculation of light distribution in the photoanode
of DSSC consisting of glass substrate (green part, soda-lime glass),
photoanode (red part, refractive index = 1.9 and absorption rate =
0.12 μm–1), and electrolyte (gray part). The
lateral boundaries are all periodic boundaries. (b) Light intensity
distribution in the DSSC photoanode without scattering layers or scattering
centers. (c) Light intensity within the DSSC photoanode with scattering
layer consisting of single layer of 500 nm sized spherical TiO2 particles. (d) Light intensity with scattering layer consisting
of single layer of 200 nm sized spherical TiO2. Incident
light intensity is set as unity with p-polarization.

However, if scattering particles are used in the
photoanode, volume
loss due to the larger particle size compared to photoanode TiO2 particles (∼20 nm) should be considered. To design
an effective scattering effect for the photoanode, according to the
results shown in Figure 1, the distribution of the particles should be considered. Thus, the
use of a 100 nm scattering center (Figure S2) with an optimized photon distribution is required to obtain effective
light distribution effects. To assess the actual effect of a 100 nm
sized TiO2 scattering center, the effects of 10 scattering
centers in the photoanode are considered (Figure 3a), where the same model is used as in Figure 2. In this figure,
more light is distributed within the electrodes than in Figure 2b, as expected. When a large
scattering layer (500 nm TiO2) is located on the photoanode,
then more photons are trapped in the electrode (Figure 3d). One feature of this distribution is that
a large proportion of the light is distributed outside the photoanode,
and in the glass substrate, because of the scattering centers near
the substrate–photoanode interface, as shown in the inset of Figure 3d. Thus, a scattering
center near the interface has a negative effect on light trapping
within the photoanode. To avoid this problem, the scattering centers
near the interface are removed, as shown in Figure 3b,e. By removing these centers, the number
of light distribution points in the photoanode can be maximized. Considering
the contiguity equation (eq 1), the electrons generated near the interface can be gathered
into electricity readily compared with those generated deep in the
photoanode, avoiding the recombination process. Thus, a stronger light
intensity near the interface, and the induction of a higher electron
generation rate near the interface, could have a strong and positive
effect on the performance of the photoanode. A thicker transparent
layer beneath the scattering center-containing photoanode gives rise
to a different photon distribution, as shown in Figure 3c,f. Compared with Figure 3b,c, in which there is no scattering layer
on the photoanode, more photons are trapped in the photoanode with
decreasing transparent photoanode layer thickness. However, this changes
when a scattering layer is located on the photoanode (Figure 3e,f). Thus, considering the
light distribution due to the scattering centers in the photoanode
and scattering layer on the photoanode, the layering sequence on the
substrate should be as follows: transparent layer, scattering center-containing
photoanode, and scattering layer. In this case, the photons are trapped
in the region of the transparent photoanode, which is located near
the substrate, where the generated electrons can be gathered into
electricity without loss. Additionally, the transparent layer has
no volume loss because it contains no scattering centers with large
TiO2 particles. From this point of view, an optimization
of the scattering center distribution should proceed according to
several considerations. First, the photons should be trapped near
the substrate in the photoanode and second, the photoanode should
have the minimum number of scattering centers. Finally, the contained
scattering center and deposited scattering layer should not allow
photons to pass through.

the interface between photoanode and substrate and (c) two scattering
center layers absent near the interface between photoanode and substrate.
(d)–(f) are same condition with (a)–(c) but with a 500
nm sized spherical scattering layer deposited on the photoanode, respectively.
The inset shows the magnified image near the interface between the
photoanode and the substrate.

The effects of vertical distribution of the scattering centers
and scattering layers on photon distribution in the photoanode are
shown in Figures 2 and 3. Based on these data, a lateral distribution of
scattering centers in the photoanode should be considered to obtain
the most effective photoanode structure with respect to light scattering
(Figure 4). The flat
and uniform distribution of scattering centers on the transparent
photoanode (Figure 4a) provides a one-dimensional distribution of light within the photoanode.
However, light scattering by a single scattering particle is a three-dimensional
event (Figure 1), so
that a three-dimensional distribution should be considered. To give
an example, a dome-shaped pattern of transparent photoanodes is introduced
at the interface between the flat transparent and scattering center-containing
photoanode layers, as shown in Figure 4b. Introduction of the dome-shaped transparent photoanode
pattern removes a portion of the scattering center as a result (Figure 4b), but the photon
distribution is shifted slightly into the interface between the substrate
and photoanode. The reason for this improvement should be studied
further, but the dome-shaped photoanode pattern may induce a lenslike
effect for the scattered light. The effect becomes clearer when the
width of the dome-shaped photoanode pattern decreases and the height
increases, as shown in Figure 4c, which indicates that the light distribution is shifted
more toward the interface between the substrate and the photoanode.
The introduction of a transparent patterned photoanode within the
photoanode can modify the photon distribution, but at the same time,
as shown in Figure 4, induce relatively fewer scattering centers, despite the enhanced
photon distribution compared with those shown in Figure 4a. Thus, the simulation results
suggest that manipulating the scattering centers and scattering layers
in three dimensions provides a new way to modify the photon distribution
in DSSC photoanodes for further performance improvement. Indeed, the
results shown in Figure 4 have not been optimized, and many challenges remain to enhance the
efficiency of photoanodes in DSSCs, where the distribution of scattering
centers within the photoanodes, and/or the morphology of the scattering
layers, could be designed in three dimensions.

different transparent photoanode shapes. (a) Light intensity in the
case of a flat and uniform interface between transparent photoanode
and scattering center containing photoanode. (b) Light intensity in
the case of dome-shaped interface between transparent and scattering
center containing ones. (c) Light intensity in the case of narrow
and deep interface between them.

Based on our simulation results on the effects of a three-dimensional
distribution of scattering centers within the DSSC photoanodes, and
a scattering layer on the photoanodes, the photoanode structures are
designed to have an improved efficiency, as shown in Figure 5a. In this illustration, the
transparent TiO2 photoanode layer is deposited on a fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrate, on which a 100 nm scattering
center containing the photoanode and scattering layer are stacked.
Between the two photoanode layers, a dome-shaped pattern of transparent
photoanodes is introduced to modify the three-dimensional distribution
of the scattering centers. The specific fabrication steps of photoanode
are shown in Figure S3 as illustration.
A cross-sectional view of the actually fabricated photoanode (Figure 5b) indicates that
the design could be implemented successfully. Introduction of the
patterned photoanodes can be achieved readily by repeated screen printing
processes using patterned masks. As shown in Figure 5c,d, patterned transparent layers can be
prepared on a flat and uniform transparent layer on which uniform
scattering center-containing photoanodes and the scattering layer
are deposited. The size of the pattern is changed from 0.1 to 1 mm
and the thickness of the pattern can be increased up to 20 μm
by increasing the number of repeated screen printings, as shown in Figure 5c,d. In these cross-sectional
micrographs, repeated deposition of patterns increases the thickness
without changing the pattern shape. The patterns are arrayed in a
hexagonal way, and each pattern also has a hexagonal shape to fill
the photoanode with a minimum area loss, as shown in Figure 5c,d.

FDTD simulations consisting of transparent photoanode, transparent
pattern, scattering center containing photoanode, and scattering layer.

photoanode designed as (a). (c) Thin and (d) thick intermediate transparent
electrode patterns with hexagonal shape and array on the uniform and
flat transparent photoanode by repeated screen printing with patterned
masks.

Our novel three-dimensional scattering
center design results in
improved performance, according to the simulation results (Figure 6). As shown in Figure 6a, the use of our
patterned transparent electrode enhances the energy conversion efficiency,
mainly in terms of current density and fill factor, whereas the open
circuit voltages show little change (Table S1). In terms of efficiency, according to the reciprocal of pattern
width shown in Figure 6b, with a similar total transparent electrode layer thickness of
20 μm, the effect of pattern width is more obvious. When the
width is fixed, the thickness of the transparent layer has little
effect on performance (Figure 6c); the photovoltaic performances are listed in Table S2. At the same time, the measured diffusivity
of electrons within the photoanode, shown in Figure 6d, indicates that it is insensitive to pattern
size and the diffusion of electrons has little effect on the enhanced
efficiency. Diffusion of the electrons is calculated from an electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy Nyquist plot (Figure S4).34 Thus, the enhanced efficiency of
the designed electrodes would be expected according to the modified
photon distribution described above, which could explain the enhanced
short-circuit current density. However, further studies are required
to determine the effects of the modified light distribution in the
photoanode on the energy conversion performance and to identify the
optimal scattering effect in or on the photoanodes of DSSCs. At this
stage, the modification of light distribution is possible by manipulating
the distribution of scattering centers or layers and by extending
the performance of the photoanode. We have moved beyond the traditional
concept of photoanodes with scattering layers, in which uniform and
flat morphologies are generally assumed. Instead, we suggest that
a three-dimensional photoanode design should be pursued to surmount
the limitations of current DSSCs.

Conclusions
Modification of the light distribution in photoanodes
of DSSCs
was achieved by a three-dimensional scattering center and scattering
layer design, based on an FDTD analysis of scattering effects in the
photoanode. By expanding the FDTD analysis from a single scattering
center to encompass vertical and lateral distributions of multiple
centers, the possible enhancement of performance through use of a
transparent patterned electrode was tested in simulations and experiments.
As a result, use of a 100 μm wide pattern between the transparent
photoanode and scattering center-containing electrode increased the
efficiency of DSSCs from 6.3 to 7.2%. These results showed that the
scattering effect within a photoanode can be exploited to modify the
light distribution of the photoanode, although a three-dimensional
design is required for optimization and to overcome the performance
limitation of current DSSCs.

Experimental Details
Light intensity
distribution simulations were performed using EM
Explorer software, which was developed for finite differential time
domain (FDTD) simulations. The light intensity was obtained by calculating
the wave function in the forms of electric field in Maxwell equation
in the time domain and then integrating in unit time. The incident
light was assumed to be polarized and plane wave in harmonic form.

FDTD method solves the Maxwell equation as the optical governing
equation. Maxwell equation is as follows and has been solved for E field.  Incident light can be expressed
as electromagnetic
field by calculating the wave equation with plane wave as continuous
wave.

For the boundary condition, perfectly matched layer was
utilized
in the z-direction and periodic boundary condition
as Bloch condition was applied in the x-direction
in the domain.

As the substrate for the photoanode and counter
electrode, FTO
(sheet resistance 7 Ω sq–1; Sigma-Aldrich)
was used. The FTO glass was rinsed with acetone, ethanol, and deionized
distilled water under sonication for 10 min each and dried with nitrogen
gas. On the FTO glass, a blocking layer (Solaronix) was deposited
by automatic screen printing (AutoMax) and sintered at 530 °C
for 3 h in air for the photoanode. A transparent layer was deposited
on the blocking layer by the same method using 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (Solaronix), and then sintered at 500 °C for
1 h in air. Then, a transparent pattern was deposited by the same
process using 20 nm TiO2 nanoparticles (CCIC) and sintered
at 500 °C for 1 h in air. Above the transparent pattern, a mixture
of small and large TiO2 nanoparticles (Solaronix) was deposited
as the scattering center and then dried at 70 °C in air. After
the scattering center had dried, 500 nm TiO2 nanoparticles
(ENB Korea) were deposited as the scattering layer and then sintered
at 500 °C for 1 h in air. The FTO glass with deposited TiO2 was soaked in a 0.3 mM ethanol solution (Sigma-Aldrich) of
N719 dye (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 20 h. The platinum
paste (Solaronix) was deposited on the FTO glass by the doctor blade
method, using 3 M tape as the counter electrode, and was then sintered
at 450 °C. To make the cell, the TiO2 photoanode was
assembled with the counter electrode using 60 μm Surlyn film
(Solaronix). The liquid electrolyte was then injected into the prepared
cell. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylptridine, and 0.1 M lithium iodide dissolved in
mixed acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile at a 2/8 volume ratio.

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S4800) was
performed to observe the surface and cross section of the patterned
photoanode. The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs was evaluated
using a solar simulator (Sun 2000; Abet Technologies) and a 1000 W
Xe source (Keithley 2400 source meter) under 1.5 AM, 1 sun conditions,
with calibration done using a KG-3 filter and NREL-certified reference
cell. A shading mask was applied to define the active area of 0.283
mm2. We have conducted the repeatability test with three
samples under same condition and variation for convincible results
of DSSC. Electrochemical characterization was performed using a BioLogic
SP-300 potentiostat. The impedance spectra were acquired under 0 V,
1 sun conditions.
