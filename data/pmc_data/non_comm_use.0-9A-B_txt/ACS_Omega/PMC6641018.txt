Efficient synthesis
and characterization of several piceno[4,3-b:9,10-b′]dithiophene (PiDT) derivatives
by Negishi coupling, epoxidation, and Lewis acid-catalyzed cycloaromatization
sequences and their potential utility in organic field-effect transistors
(OFETs) have been reported. PiDT derivatives, with extended π-electron
systems, showed high air stability due to their deep highest occupied
molecular orbital energy levels (around −5.6 eV). OFET devices
based on 2,11-dioctylated PiDT (C8-PiDT) showed excellent
hole mobility, as high as 2.36 cm2 V–1 s–1. Their structure–property relationships
were investigated by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy.

Introduction
Over
the last decade, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)
have gained considerable attention as key components of the next generation
of electronic devices because of their flexibility, light weight,
low cost, ease of design, and printability,1 leading many researchers in academia and industry to work on the
production of OFETs with superior performances.2 For instance, charge-carrier mobility, a crucial parameter
for OFET performance, has advanced from an initial value of 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1 for merocyanine, first reported in 1984,3 to the state-of-the-art value of 20.9 cm2 V–1 s–1 for hole mobility in polycrystalline films
of 3,10-(C14H29)2picene.4

To develop high-performance OFETs, there
are three representative
strategies: (1) inserting sulfur atom(s) into the molecular framework,
which enhances carrier mobility because of the effective π–π
interactions attributed to the large van der Waals radius of a sulfur
atom; (2) introducing alkyl chains or aromatic rings as substituents
in the long-axis direction, which generates strong intermolecular
interactions, leading to high crystallinity, and increases their solubility
in common organic solvents; and (3) extending their π-electron
systems by adding more fused rings, which affords more effective orbital
overlaps and thus strong intermolecular interactions between neighboring
molecules in the solid state. For instance, Takeya and co-workers
reported that N-shaped dinaphtho[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DNBDT), consisting of seven fused aromatic
rings, and its dialkylated derivative, C10-DNBDT-NW, showed
a high hole mobility of 16 cm2 V–1 s–1 in single crystals formed by the edge-cast method.5 In addition, Takimiya and co-workers showed that
bis[1]benzothieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]naphtho[2,3-b:6,7-b′]dithiophene (BBTNDT), consisting of eight fused aromatic
rings, and its derivative DPh-BBTNDT exhibited a high hole mobility
of 7 cm2 V–1 s–1 in
polycrystalline films.6 However, there
have been several reports on the development of OFETs by the third
approach that mention the difficulty of synthesis due to the decreasing
solubility as the number of fused rings increases.

We have reported
efficient synthesis of five fused aromatic ring-containing
phenanthro[1,2-b:8,7-b′]dithiophene
(PDT) by replacing the terminal benzene rings in picene with thiophene
rings.7 On the basis of the expectation
of obtaining a high mobility with a fastener effect, its dialkylated
derivatives (Cn-PDTs) were synthesized.8 This yielded a C12-PDT-based OFET
that exhibited a hole mobility of 1.75 cm2 V–1 s–1 with SiO2 gate dielectrics and
a higher mobility of 2.19 cm2 V–1 s–1 with an HfO2 gate dielectric with a high k-value.9 Considering the earlier
reports showing that FET properties are affected by both the length
of the alkyl chains and number of fused aromatic rings10 and the third strategy, we have designed piceno[4,3-b:9,10-b′]dithiophene (PiDT), including
seven fused rings and thus extending the conjugated π system.
Here, we report the synthesis of PiDT and two of its derivatives,
with alkyl (C8 and C10) groups at the 2 and
11 positions, and their physicochemical and FET properties.

Results
and Discussion
Considering the synthesis of alkylated PiDT
derivatives, we first
prepared two types of 4-formyl-2-alkylthiophenes, 5b and 5c, as the coupling partners. 2-Bromo-5-alkylthiophenes 3b and 3c were prepared in high yield through
bromination of alkylated thiophenes 2b and 2c with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Successively, 4-formyl-2-alkylthiophenes 5b and 5c were synthesized via isomerization
of 3b and 3c with lithium diisopropylamide
(LDA),11 followed by formylation by sequential
treatment with n-butyllithium and dimethylformamide
(DMF) (Scheme 1). The
overall yields of 5b and 5c, obtained from
thiophene (1) in four steps, were 37 and 47%, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 4-Formyl-2-alkylthiophenes 5b and 5c
To synthesize precursors
of PiDT derivatives 7a–c, we carried
out palladium-catalyzed Negishi coupling of
2,7-dibromophenanthrene (6)12 with the in situ prepared 2-alkyl-4-formyl-5-thienyl zinc reagents
derived from the regioselective zincation of 5 using
TMPZnCl·LiCl.13 Subsequent epoxidation
of 7a–c and Lewis acid-catalyzed
Friedel–Crafts-type intramolecular cycloaromatization afforded
the desired products, 9a–c, in 29–52%
yield (Scheme 2).14 With regard to the regioselectivity of the cycloaromatization
reaction, although the three structural isomers of 9 could
theoretically be formed, we were pleased to obtain exclusively phenacene-type
molecules of 9, in the pure form, because the electrophilic
attack that controlled the regioselectivity tended to occur on the
higher local electron density of the indicated carbon atoms (red dot),
as shown in Figures S12 and S13 and Schemes S1 and S2. The PiDT derivatives, 9a–c, that were obtained were purified by twice-repeated vacuum
sublimation for further measurement of physicochemical properties
and fabrication of OFET devices.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of PiDTs 9a–c
Next, we investigated the optical and electrochemical
properties
of 9a–c. UV–vis absorption
spectra of 9a–c in CH2Cl2 are shown in Figure 1a. The maximum absorption wavelength of PiDT 9a was observed at 306 nm, and dialkylated derivatives 9b and 9c showed almost the same absorption maximum
at 309 nm. In cyclic voltammograms of 9a–c (Figure 1b), 9a showed a clear oxidation wave, whereas the oxidation
waves of 9b and 9c were weaker than those
of 9a due to their low solubility, derived from a strong
hydrophobic interaction induced by alkyl chains. The estimated highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were almost the same,
around −5.6 eV, indicating that the introduction of alkyl chains
on the molecular framework does not affect the electronic state of
PiDT because the HOMO coefficients did not localize at the 2,11-positions
(Figure S15). Furthermore, the coefficients
of HOMO in 9a–c show the same geometry
as that of high-performance phenacene-type molecules,4,15 which encourages us to expect that 9a–c would show not only high air stability but also high hole
mobility in OFET devices.

(b) Cyclic voltammograms
of 9a–c (1 mM) in CH2Cl2 solution containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as
the supporting electrolyte, at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1.

To explore the FET characteristics,
we fabricated OFET devices
based on 9a–c and using an Si/SiO2 substrate. The surface of the Si/SiO2 substrate
was treated with n-octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) or n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) as a self-assembled monolayer
(SAM). The active layer of 9a–c was
formed by vapor deposition at the rate of 0.1 Å s–1, and sequential thermal annealing was carried out at 100, 150, and
200 °C for 30 min in an inert atmosphere to form thin films with
a highly ordered packing structure. All fabricated devices
exhibited typical p-type characteristics under ambient conditions
in the dark. The best hole mobilities under the optimized FET parameters
are summarized in Table 1. The OFET devices based on 9a showed a hole mobility
of 0.84 cm2 V–1 s–1, which is higher by a factor of 8 than that of PDT-based OFET devices
(0.11 cm2 V–1 s–1).7 The mobilities of OFET devices based on dialkylated
PiDTs 9b and 9c were much higher than those
of 9a-based OFET devices, presumably owing to the expected
fastener effects.16 As shown in Figure 2b,e, the transfer
and output curves of the 9b-based OFET device exhibited
the highest mobility of 2.36 cm2 V–1 s–1, which is an excellent value in polycrystalline films.
However, the absolute threshold voltages of 9a–c were high, around 50 V, due to the large energy barrier17 between the work function of gold (5.1 eV)18 as source and drain electrodes and HOMO energy
levels of 9. Therefore, we next changed the SAM from
OTS or ODTS to 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (FOTS), which
can play a crucial role in shifting the absolute threshold voltage
to the positive side.19 This reduced the
absolute threshold voltage from 49 to 29 V. However, the mobility
in 9b-based OFET devices was also reduced to 1.45 cm2 V–1 s–1.

To investigate the molecular orientation
and surface morphology
of the fabricated thin films of 9a–c, we next examined out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. The lattice spacing (d); the molecular length (L) estimated
from DFT calculations that were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
using the Gaussian 09, revision A.02, program package (Figure S19);20 the
tilt angles (θ) based on d001; and
the crystallite size (l) evaluated from (00l) diffraction
are listed in Table 2. The thin film of 9a showed fourth-order (00l) diffraction
peaks, indicating that 9a formed a layer-by-layer structure
similar to that of high-performance thienoacenes (Figure 3a).5,6,10 Moreover, the calculated tilt
angle was nearly 0°, indicating that 9a has a completely
edge-on orientation to the substrate, which is superior for carrier
transport in OFET devices (Figure S20).
On the other hand, the thin films of 9b and 9c also showed a series of (001) diffraction peaks up to the fifth
and seventh orders, respectively (Figure 3b,c). However, the tilt angles of 9b and 9c were over 30°, which are similar to those
of high-performance phenacene-type materials.15,21 Furthermore, the introduced alkyl chains affect the crystallite
size (l). The l values of 9b and 9c were larger than those of 9a, which might be one of the reasons why the mobilities of OFET devices
based on 9b and 9c are higher than those
of 9a-based OFET devices.

AFM was used to gain more insight
into the structure–property
relationships. The AFM images (5 × 5 μm2) of
thin films of 9a on an OTS-treated substrate showed large
crystalline grains, which are similar to those in high-performance
materials (Figure 4a).6,10 However, a number of clear grain boundaries
were also observed, which suppress effective carrier transport. On
the other hand, a smooth surface and ambiguous grain boundaries were
observed on the surface of the fabricated thin films of 9b and 9c, which showed superior carrier transport in
OFET devices (Figure 4b,c). The grain size of 9b was much larger than that
of 9c. Furthermore, we could observe steps corresponding
to the d-spacing of 9b (3.1 nm), indicating
that the flat monolayer formed on the substrate resulted in effective
carrier transport (Figure S24). Therefore,
we concluded that the film quality of 9b was the best,
yielding the highest mobility of up to 2.36 cm2 V–1 s–1.

(Tanneal = 200 °C for 9a and 9c, Tanneal = 150 °C
for 9b).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed novel PiDT
derivatives through
sequential palladium-catalyzed Negishi coupling, epoxidation, and
Lewis acid-catalyzed regioselective cycloaromatization. The UV–vis
absorption spectra and CV measurements for the synthesized 9a–c showed very similar optical and electrochemical
properties. High-performance FET characteristics were observed for
dialkylated PiDTs 9b and 9c. The highest
mobility, 2.36 cm2 V–1 s–1, was achieved for the fabricated OFET devices based on 9b on an ODTS-treated Si/SiO2 substrate. However, the absolute
threshold voltage was also high, due to the deep HOMO energy level
of 9b. To achieve a higher mobility and lower voltage
operation, we are currently undertaking the design and synthesis of
novel organic materials with extended π-electron systems and
incorporating acene moieties into phenacene-type molecular frameworks.

stirred at this temperature for 1 h. 2,7-Dibromophenanthrene (6) (504 mg, 1.5 mmol, 1 equiv), Pd(dba)2 (43 mg,
0.075 mmol, 5 mol %), and [HPt-Bu3]BF4 (44 mg, 0.15 mmol, 10 mol %) were added at room temperature.
The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at reflux for 9 h and then
poured into MeOH; the formed solid was filtered. The filter cake was

Fabrication of Vapor-Deposited OFET Devices
Typical
bottom-gate top-contact OFET devices were fabricated as follows: All
processes, except for substrate cleaning, were performed under a nitrogen
atmosphere. A heavily doped n-Si wafer with 200 nm
thick thermally grown SiO2 (Ci = 17.3 nF cm–2) as the dielectric layer was used
as the substrate. The Si/SiO2 substrates were carefully
cleaned by ultrasonication with acetone and isopropanol for 10 min,
respectively. After drying, the substrates were irradiated with UV–O3 for 20 min and then treated with a solution of 0.1 M OTS,
ODTS in anhydrous toluene, and a vapor of FOTS to form an SAM. The
active layers were deposited on the treated substrate by vapor deposition
at a rate of 0.1 Å s–1. Thermal annealing was
performed at 100, 150, and 200 °C for 30 min on the hotplate
in the glovebox. After treatment, gold electrodes (50 nm thick) were
deposited through a shadow mask on top of the active layer under reduced
pressure (5 × 10–5 Pa). The current–voltage
characteristics of the OFET devices were measured at room temperature
in air on a Keithley 6430 sub-femto ampere remote sourcemeter combined
with a Keithley 2400 measure-source unit. Field-effect mobilities
were calculated in the saturation regime of ID using the following equation  where Ci is the
capacitance of the SiO2 insulator; ID is the source–drain current; and VD, VG, and Vth are the source–drain, gate, and threshold voltages,
respectively. The current on/off ratio (Ion/off) was determined from a minimum ID at
around VG = −60 V.
