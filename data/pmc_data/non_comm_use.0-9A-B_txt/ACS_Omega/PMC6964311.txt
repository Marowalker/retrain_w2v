Dumbbell Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunctions
were synthesized for the first time via a simple in situ precipitation
method. The as-prepared Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction
showed high photocatalytic activity in the decomposition of methyl
orange aqueous solution under simulated solar irradiation. The high
improvement of photocatalytic activity compared to that of pure ZnO
can be attributed to the formation of the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction. Furthermore, the mechanism of photocatalytic
activity was investigated in detail. The free radical trapping experiments
indicated that the superoxide radical (·O2–) was an important active species in the photocatalytic process.
This paper provides a new prospect for the preparation of photocatalysts
with high catalytic performance in the degradation of dye wastewater.

1 Introduction
It is believed that environmental
pollution and energy shortage problems are the greatest challenges
that mankind must face in this century.1−7 In the last few years, semiconductors, such as ZnO, TiO2, CdS, g-C3N4, and Fe3O4,8−13 have been attracting widespread concerns about their ability to
degrade organic matters.

Among diverse semiconductor materials,
ZnO, with a band gap of 3.3 eV,14 has been
widely used in the photocatalytic field owing to its high catalytic
activity, nontoxicity, low cost, and absence of contribution to secondary
pollution to the environment.15−17 Nevertheless, the low utilization
of visible light and quick recombination of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs during the photocatalytic process limit the application of a
ZnO semiconductor.18 In order to ameliorate
its photocatalytic activity, some methods have been tried,19 for instance, doping with nonmetals.20,21 Although some morphologies of ZnO have been reported, such as ZnO
nanowires, nanobelts, nanoflowers,22,23 etc., dumbbell
ZnO has rarely been synthesized.24−26 In addition, the dumbbell
shape of ZnO may have a certain effect on its photocatalytic performance.

Another one of the most common methods is to form a heterostructure
by means of combining ZnO with other materials. Silver-based materials
such as AgCl, Ag3PO4, Ag2WO4, and Ag2CO327−30 are promising photocatalysts,
which can absorb visible light. Ag2CO3 is a
new type of high-efficiency visible light catalyst with a narrow band
gap, which shows good activity in photocatalytic degradation of colored
dyes.31 The separation efficiency of photogenerated
electrons and holes can be improved by constructing a heterojunction.32,33 The introduction of Ag2CO3 into ZnO can notably
improve the photocatalytic performance of ZnO because the charge separation
will be greatly enhanced by the heterojunction between ZnO and Ag2CO3.34,35 Therefore, a heterojunction
combining ZnO with Ag2CO3 can broaden the optical
response range of ZnO, promote the separation of photogenerated electrons
and holes, and markedly enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZnO.

In this paper, dumbbell Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunctions are prepared by an in situ precipitation method, and
the effects of different contents of Ag2CO3 on
photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange are studied. The results
show that the prepared Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction
significantly enhances the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange
under simulated solar irradiation. In addition, a detailed analysis
of the mechanism of the photocatalytic reaction was carried out.

2 Results and Discussion
In order to
confirm the formation of the Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunction, the structure of the prepared samples was studied
by the XRD technique. Figure 1 provides the XRD patterns of the ZnO and Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction with diverse contents of Ag2CO3. Figure 1a shows that the diffraction peaks of pure ZnO correspond
to the wurtzite of a ZnO crystal (JCPDS card no. 36-1451). Curves
b–e in Figure 1 show the XRD patterns of 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO,
15% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO, and 25% Ag2CO3–ZnO,
respectively. All diffraction peaks of Ag2CO3 correspond to a monoclinic structure (JCPDS card no. 26-0339). With
the increase of Ag2CO3 content, the intensity
of the ZnO peak decreased. No additional peaks were detected in all
samples, indicating no other substances. It demonstrates that the
Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction is successfully
prepared by the in situ precipitation method. Figure S1 displays the XPS spectra of the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction; the full XPS spectrum in Figure S1a shows the presence of Zn, O, C, and
Ag signals in the Ag2CO3–ZnO sample.
Moreover, Figure S1b–e presents
the XPS spectra for Zn 2p, O 1s, C 1s, and Ag 3d of Ag2CO3–ZnO. The results of the XPS spectra further
confirm the presence of Ag2CO3 in the Ag2CO3–ZnO composite.

ZnO, (b) 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO, (c) 15% Ag2CO3–ZnO, (d) 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO, and (e) 25% Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunctions.

The morphology of the prepared samples was obtained
using SEM. Figure 2a–e shows the SEM images of the prepared pure ZnO, 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 15% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO, and 25%
Ag2CO3–ZnO, respectively. The morphology
of the ZnO sample is dumbbell in shape, and Ag2CO3 is distributed around ZnO. According to Figure 2b–e, with the increase of silver carbonate
content, the amounts of silver carbonate loaded with dumbbell ZnO
increased obviously. The energy-dispersive system (EDS) mapping analysis
(Figure 2f–i)
reveals the presence of zinc, oxygen, carbon, and silver elements.
As shown in Figure 2, almost spherical Ag2CO3 particles are distributed
around the dumbbell-like ZnO in binary composites. Figure 3 presents the TEM and HRTEM
images of the 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction.
From the high-resolution (HRTEM) images, we can see two intersecting
lattices. The lattices of 0.260 and 0.227 nm accord with the (002)
plane of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO and the (031) plane of monoclinic-phase
Ag2CO3, respectively. It further confirms the
formation of the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction.
According to the SEM and TEM images, the average particle sizes of
Ag2CO3 and ZnO are 100 nm and 1.5 μm,
respectively.

The chemical bond vibration types of the prepared
samples were investigated by FT-IR spectra. Figure 4 displays the representative FT-IR spectra
of ZnO, 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 15% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO,
and 25% Ag2CO3–ZnO. All samples have
a strong peak at 3300 cm–1; the peak is caused by
the stretching vibration of surface −OH groups.36 As for the Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunction, the absorption peaks displayed in 693, 833, 1394,
and 1460 cm–1 due to the presence of CO32–.37 In the process
of photocatalysis, the surface −OH groups can combine with
the photogenerated holes (h+) to form ·OH, which can
availably decompose dye molecules. Due to the presence of surface
hydroxyl groups, the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction
may possess potential photocatalytic activity.

pure ZnO, (b) 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO, (c) 15%
Ag2CO3–ZnO, (d) 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO, and (e) 25% Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunctions.

UV–vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectroscopy
(UV–vis DRS) was used to determine the optical absorption of
the catalyst at different wavelengths (300–700 nm). The results
in Figure 5 display
that ZnO has strong absorption in the ultraviolet region, but the
absorption peak in the visible region is weak. All the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunctions exhibit strong photocatalytic
activity compared with pure ZnO in the visible region, which showed
its potential application in sunlight. In addition, with the increasing
Ag2CO3 content, the absorption of the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction in the visible light
region enhanced obviously. Figure S2 demonstrates
the band gap values of all samples, which is calculated according
to the formula (αhν)2 = A(hν–Eg).38 In Figure S2, the Eg values of pure ZnO,
Ag2CO3, 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO,
15% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO, and 25% Ag2CO3–ZnO
are 3.30, 2.30, 2.83, 2.61, 2.47, and 2.37 eV, respectively. These Eg values describe that the energy-band structure
of ZnO was modified by adding Ag2CO3.

Photoluminescence spectroscopy is commonly used
to discuss the transfer and recombination of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs. The PL spectra of all samples are shown in Figure 6. The result indicates that
pure ZnO shows a stronger fluorescence emission peak at 581 nm, while
the PL intensity of all Ag2CO3–ZnO samples
is lower than that of it. It means that the effective interface electron
transfers from the conduction band of ZnO to the Ag2CO3 nanoparticles, which hindered the recombination of electron–hole
pairs. In addition, the PL spectrum of the 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction shows the strongest fluorescence
quenching phenomenon, which implies that the 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction can availably restrain the recombination
of electron–hole pairs and improve photocatalytic activity.

PL spectra of pure ZnO and all Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunctions.

To further obtain a better understanding of the
separation and recombination of electron–hole pairs between
the ZnO and Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction,
we performed photocurrent and EIS tests under simulated sunlight irradiation. Figure 7a displays the photocurrent–time
curves of different samples in the on–off cycle mode. All the
Ag2CO3–ZnO samples showed an enhanced
photocurrent response intensity compared with ZnO, among which the
20% Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction showed
the highest photocurrent response intensity. The results indicate
that the combination of zinc oxide and silver carbonate greatly improved
the separation and transfer efficiency of light-generated e––h+ pairs. In addition, EIS plots of all samples
in Figure 7b show the
same results as the photocurrent response curves. This gave strong
evidence to support the above PL results.

Figure 7 (a) Photocurrent response
curves and (b) EIS Nyquist plot of the samples under simulated sunlight
irradiation.

The photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples
was examined by degradation of methyl orange under simulated sunlight
irradiation. Figure 8a presents the photocatalytic efficiency of all samples under simulated
sunlight irradiation. It can be observed that methyl orange has almost
no self-degradation in the absence of a catalyst. After 90 min of
the reaction, the degradation rates of methyl orange solution were
16.5, 77.4, 90.8, 97.1, and 93.9% by using ZnO, 10% Ag2CO3–ZnO, 15% Ag2CO3–ZnO,
20% Ag2CO3–ZnO, and 25% Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunctions as photocatalysts, respectively.
The photocatalytic activity of the Ag2CO3–ZnO
heterojunction was higher than that of pure ZnO. In addition, the
content of Ag2CO3 plays an important role in
improving the photocatalytic performance of Ag2CO3–ZnO composites. By calculating the first-order reaction constants
of methyl orange solution, it is found that methyl orange solution
follows pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics, as shown in Figure 8b. The photocatalytic
activity of the 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction
is approximately 19 times higher than that of pure ZnO. In addition,
the reproducibility of Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction
photocatalysts was demonstrated by MO degradation experiments at room
temperature. Figure 8c shows that the degradation efficiency of the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction photocatalyst can still reach approximately
92% after five degradation experiments, which indicates that the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction photocatalyst has
good recyclability. The results in Figure 8b,c show that the binary composite nanomaterial
Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction can effectively
degrade organic pollutants in wastewater.

of MO using all samples. (b) −ln(C/C0) versus irradiation time for all samples and
(c) cycle curves of the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange
by 20% Ag2CO3–ZnO under simulated sunlight
irradiation.

As described in Figure 9, we provide the photocatalytic mechanism
of the Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction. Pure
ZnO can only absorb ultraviolet light that only accounts for a small
part of sunlight, while Ag2CO3 could absorb
visible light. Under simulated sunlight illumination, ZnO and Ag2CO3 can produce photogenerated electrons and holes.
Under an excitation energy larger than the band gap of ZnO, the electrons
on the valence band (VB) of ZnO are transferred to the conduction
band (CB) to produce the electron–hole pairs; the photogenerated
electrons of ZnO CB can react with O2 to form a superoxide
radical (O2–). Since the CB of Ag2CO3 is lower than the standard oxidation–reduction
potential of O2/·O2–,
photogenerated electrons on the conduction band of Ag2CO3 cannot reduce O2 to ·O2–; thus, the photogenerated electrons on the CB of Ag2CO3 will be transferred to the VB of ZnO to recombine with the
holes of ZnO.39,40 In addition, since the VB of
Ag2CO3 is more negative than the VB of ZnO,
the photogenerated holes on the VB of zinc oxide are transferred to
the VB of Ag2CO3; the photogenerated holes in
the Ag2CO3 VB could oxidize H2O to
produce hydroxyl radicals (·OH). As is known to all, ·O2–, ·OH, and photogenerated cavities
(h+) are the main active substances in photocatalytic degradation
of organic pollutants.41−43

Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction under simulated
sunlight irradiation.

The free radical trapping experiment is an effective
method to conduct an inquiry into the photodegradation reaction pathway
of organic molecules on the surface of photocatalysts. In order to
investigate the photocatalytic mechanism of Ag2CO3–ZnO degradation of methyl orange, we used BQ, IPA, and MeOH
for free-radical capture experiments.44−48 As shown in Figure 10, the photodegradation efficiency of methyl orange
is 10.8% when BQ is added. When IPA is used as a radical scavenger,
the photodegradation efficiency of methyl orange is 45.2%. If MeOH
is invoked as a quencher, the photodegradation efficiency of methyl
orange is up to 75.6%. The results present that ·O2–, ·OH, and h+ can play roles in
photocatalytic degradation. Additionally, the electron spin resonance
(ESR) measurements of Ag2CO3–ZnO are
tested under simulated sunlight irradiation to further study its degradation
mechanism. As shown in Figure 11, in the process of a chemical reaction, four groups
of signals were detected from the DMPO–·OH and DMPO–·O2– systems, which indicated the presence
of hydroxyl radicals and the superoxide radical during the catalysis
process. Thus, the influence order of the activated substance in the
process of methyl orange photodegradation is ·O2– > ·OH > h+.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunctions are successfully prepared
with different contents of Ag2CO3 by the in
situ precipitation method. It was found by photocatalytic degradation
experiments that the activity of Ag2CO3–ZnO
is significantly improved under full-spectrum light source irradiation.
The Ag2CO3–ZnO heterojunction, which
is synthesized by this method, not only broadens the response range
of visible light but also enhances the photocatalytic degradation
activity of methyl orange. The mechanism of photocatalytic activity
of Ag2CO3–ZnO is confirmed by photoluminescence
(PL), the photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS), and the free-radical trapping experiment. This study provides
a significant photocatalyst for the degradation of organic dyes.

4.3 Characterization
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) using a scanning
rate of 10°/min for 2θ ranging from 10° to 70°.
The surface morphology was determined by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (JSM-6510) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on JEM-2100F (JEOL Inc., Japan),
employing an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The infrared spectra
were obtained on the PerkinElmer Frontier Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrometer; KBr is the reference sample with a wavelength
range of 400–4000 cm–1. UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer
by using BaSO4 as a reference. The photoluminescence (PL)
spectra of the photocatalyst were measured at room temperature with
325 nm as the excitation wavelength and a Xe lamp as the source of
excitation. All ESR measurements were carried out using an electron
paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (JEOL, JES-FA200) at an ambient
temperature.

4.4 Measurement of Photocatalytic Activity
In order to study the photocatalytic degradation ability, 0.1 g of
the as-prepared sample was dispersed in a 50 mL methyl orange solution
with a concentration of 1 × 10–4 mol/L, and
the suspensions were stirred for 30 min in the dark to attain equilibrium
adsorption on the catalyst surface. Then, a 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE
300) without an optical filter was used for full spectrum irradiation.
After the irradiation period, 5 mL of the mixture was withdrawn, and
the catalyst was separated by centrifugation (6000 r/min, 4 min).
Afterward, the concentration of the methyl orange solution was measured
by an ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda
35, Singapore), and the photocatalytic degradation ability was investigated.
The free-radical trapping experiments were carried out by adding 1
mmol of benzoquinone (BQ), methanol (MeOH), and isopropanol (IPA).
All reactions were carried out at room temperature.

4.5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) Measurements
The steps for preparing the electrode are as follows: 100 mg of
the sample was evenly dispersed in 20 mL of acetone. The dispersed
catalyst was spin-coated on a 1 cm × 1 cm FTO glass electrode
through a 10 V DC power source and then dried by a rubber suction
bulb. The photoelectrochemical test was carried out on a three-electrode
system using a 0.1 m sodium sulfate solution as the
electrolyte. The as-prepared photocatalyst film is the working electrode,
the counter electrode is platinum, and the reference electrode is
silver/silver chloride. The photoelectrochemical measurements were
performed on a CHI-760E electrochemical analyzer from Shanghai Chenhua
