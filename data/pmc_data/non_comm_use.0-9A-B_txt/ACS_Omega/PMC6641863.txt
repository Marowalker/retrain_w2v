Neurotrophins
are essential proteins for the development and maintenance
of neural functions as well as promising drugs in neurodegenerative
disorders. Current limits in their effective clinical applications
can be overwhelmed by the combined use of peptidomimetic and nanomedicine
approaches. Indeed, neurotrophin-mimicking peptides may allow minimizing
the adverse side effects of the whole protein drug. Moreover, the
immobilization of such peptides on nanomaterials may offer additional
advantages, including protection against degradation, enhanced permeability
of barrier membranes, and intrinsic therapeutic properties of the
nanoparticles (e.g., antiangiogenic and plasmonic features of gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs)). In the present article, we scrutinize the
functionalization of spherical AuNPs of diameter 12 nm by peptides
because of the N-terminal domains of the nerve growth factor (NGF)
and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NGF1-14 and BDNF1-12,
respectively. The hybrid gold–peptide nanobiointerface was
investigated, both in the direct physisorption and in the lipid-bilayer-mediated
adsorption processes, by a multitechnique study that included UV–vis
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, dynamic light scattering,
zeta-potential analyses, and atomic force microscopy. Both peptide-
and lipid-dependent features were identified, to have a modulation
in the peptide coverage of nanoparticles as well as in the cellular
uptake of NGF and BDNF peptides, as investigated by confocal microscopy.
The promising potentials of the neurotrophins to cross the blood–brain
barrier were demonstrated.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticle-based
platforms have recently attracted much attention
for the delivery of drugs and molecules with neuroprotective and regenerative
activities that, under normal conditions, cannot pass through the
blood–brain barrier (BBB), the vital interface between the
neural tissue and circulating blood.1,2

Neurotrophin
proteins, produced by the cells of the central nervous
system (CNS), are growth factors regulating the neuron division, survival,
and neurite outgrowth.3,4 A forefront medicine research
area deals with making neurotrophins a clinical reality for people
suffering from disorders, involving neuronal degeneration (such as
Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s disease)5−7 and physical trauma resulting in the severing of nerve connections
(i.e., accidents and sports-related injuries).8

Despite the great potential of neurotrophic factors in the
therapeutic
action, their clinical application has been so far limited because
of their poor plasma stability, low penetration of the BBB, and serious
side effects, such as pain.9,10 So far, only few cases
of neurotrophin-based drugs have been approved for use in humans,
that is, for administering opioids in chronic pain management and
as antisplasticity drugs for spinal cord injury.8

The potential of neurotrophin-based drugs can be
enhanced by new
hybrid systems comprising (1) peptides capable of mimicking the whole
proteins by retaining their functionality of neurotrophic action11 and (2) nanoparticles capable of binding the
neurotrophin-like drug by either physical or chemical immobilization,12,13 where the drug-delivery capability and the ability to cross the
BBB could be finely controlled over their size, surface charge, hydrophobicity,
shape, coating, and chemistry.1,14−17

We have recently demonstrated that peptide sequences NGF1-14
and
BDNF1-12, which encompass the N-terminal domain of nerve growth factor
(NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), respectively,
exhibit neurotrophin-mimicking capabilities also upon immobilization
on the solid gold surface.18,19 In the present study,
we move a step forward on the fabrication and biological validation
of the hybrid nanobiointerface established between neurotrophin peptides
and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that represents an attractive scaffold
to construct a multifaceted theranostic platform (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Representative Picture
of the Hybrid AuNP–Peptide Interface
for a Submonolayer or Monolayer Coverage by NGFpF (a) and
BDNFpF (b) Peptides
Indeed, AuNPs provide an excellent nanocarrier for the
modulation
of interfacial processes in biological and material applications.20 For example, AuNPs possess intrinsic antiangiogenic21 and anti-inflammatory activities;22 also, because of their plasmonic properties,
they are suitable for light-triggered response (e.g., hyperthermia
in tumor treatment23) and optical imaging
(biosensing24,25). Furthermore, drug-functionalized
AuNPs might be able to cross the BBB and allow for a target-specific
delivery of the active molecules to the neurons of the CNS.15

In general, AuNPs can open highly structured
tight junctions that
connect endothelial cells, which are the main components of the brain
microvascular anatomy, together with the basement membrane and neighboring
cells,26 including pericytes, astrocytes,
neurons, and microglia (neurovascular unit).27 Overall, they contribute to create selective permeability for the
entry of molecules between the systemic circulation and nervous tissue,
maintaining the CNS homeostasis.

To enhance the image-contrast
capability of the newly assembled
platform,28 the NGF- and BDNF-like peptides
were dye-labeled with carboxyfluorescein (Fam) through an additional
lysine (K) residue at the C-terminus, to obtain SSSHPIFHRGEFSV-K-Fam
(NGFpF) and HSDPARRGELSV-K-Fam (BDNFpF), respectively.

2 Results and Discussion
To modulate the peptide–metal
surface interaction, a dual
approach, involving direct adsorption and a lipid-mediated interaction
between the peptide and the gold surfaces, was used.

In the
latter case, either NGFpP or BDNFpF was loaded
in small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) of zwitterionic
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine
(POPC), to obtain NGFpF-PC or BDNFpF-PC, respectively.

The UV–vis titration spectra in Figure 1 show that a redshift of the plasmonic band
associated with a small but significant (about 10% absorbance shift)
hyperchromic effect is achieved by adding peptides at increasing concentrations.
It must be noted that at higher peptide concentrations (≥10–6 M), as shown in Figure 1, the apparent downshift of λ is instead
due to the absorption of the Fam moiety (λmax ∼490
nm) from NGFpF and BDNFpF peptides.

Figure 1 UV–vis
spectra of AuNPs (2.2 nM) before (in water and in
3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer)
and after the addition of peptides at increasing concentrations (range,
2 × 10–7–1.2 × 10–6 M) of (a) NGFpF, (b) BDNFpF, (c) NGFpF-PC, and (d) BDNFpF-PC. Insets: ΔA–Δλ scatter plots, with arrows indicating different
steps of plasmon shifts (I, II). All experiments are conducted in
triplicate.

The saturation in the
shifts of wavelength (Δλ) and
absorbance (ΔA) is reached at the added peptide
concentrations of 0.5 μM for NGFpF and 1 μM
for BDNFpF, NGFpF-PC, and BDNFpF-PC.
This finding suggest that at these concentrations the maximum size
of the hybrid assembly comprising a metal core (AuNP) surrounded by
a soft shell (peptide molecules) is obtained, as monitored in terms
of the optical sensing of the hybrid interface by the plasmonic nanoparticle.

Indeed, the intensity of maximum absorbance increases and the wavelength
of the localized surface plasmon resonance band peak shifts to longer
wavelengths with increasing number of molecules adsorbed on the AuNP,
due to the corresponding increase in the dielectric constant of the
local regions near the interfaces of gold.29,30 The parallel occurrence of these two spectral features, as shown
in Figure 1, indicates
that the size increase of the colloidal metal is mostly due to the
“decoration” of the nanoparticle surface by the adsorbed
peptide molecules rather than a partial aggregation phenomenon.31

Specifically, as to the direct peptide–AuNP
interaction
(Figure 1a,b), the
plots of ΔA versus Δλ exhibit a
direct one-step change for NGFpF but a two-step change
for BDNFpF (see insets). Therefore, for NGFpF–AuNP and BDNFpF–AuNP interactions, the
measured curve shifts likely depend on the different stages of the
peptide adsorption process, which is in turn related to the possible
diverse orientation/conformation of the molecules at the interface
with the AuNP surface. Such a finding is in agreement with the dissimilar
affinities of the two peptides toward the Au surface, as demonstrated
for NGF and BDNF peptides at the interface with flat gold, resulting
in viscoelastic and rigid adlayers, respectively.18,19

As to the lipid-mediated peptide–AuNP interaction (Figure 1c,d), a significant
synergic effect from each component, that is, peptide, lipid, and
AuNP, is monitored at the hybrid nanobiointerface. First, for NGFpF-PC, the peptide concentration at equilibrium, that is, the
value corresponding to the saturation in the plasmonic peak shifts,
increases up to 1 μM, comparable to that of BDNFpF-PC, with a corresponding calculated coverage of about 2.4 ×
107 for both NGFpF-PC–AuNP and BDNFpF-PC–AuNP interfaces. This fact suggests an active
role of the fluid lipid membrane in the confinement of NGF peptide
at the interface with the gold surface.32 Such an effect would prompt a more “ordered” interaction
with AuNPs and therefore a higher number of molecules detected by
the plasmonic sensing.

Second, the insets in Figure 1c,d show also a peptide-driven
effect, as both Δλ
and ΔA are narrower for NGFpF-PC
than for BDNFpF-PC, consistent with that observed for NGFpF and BDNFpF, respectively.

Third, the UV–vis
spectra of pellets and supernatants recovered
after the centrifugation step used to remove unbound and/or loosely
bound peptide molecules from the peptide–AuNP hybrid systems
(Figure S2) demonstrate a lower nanoparticle
aggregation for the peptide-loaded SUVs/AuNPs in comparison with POPC
SUVs (without peptide)/AuNPs.

In general, the centrifugation
step, under the experimental conditions
used, is efficient to collect, from the pellets, peptide-functionalized
AuNPs (Figure S3). In particular, the comparison
between the spectra of pellets and supernatants shows an almost totally
irreversible adsorption for NGFpF and BDNFpF
in the direct interaction with the AuNPs. On the other hand, for the
lipid-mediated interaction, as the spectra of supernatants clearly
display spectral features of free peptides and/or peptide/PC systems,
a partially reversible adsorption occurred. These findings indicate
the possibility, through the lipid-mediated interaction, of modulating
also the actual peptide coating onto AuNPs.

A semiquantitative
estimation of the different interactions occurring
between the two peptides and AuNPs can be obtained by the approximate
nanoparticle coverage, calculated according to the peptide concentrations
used to reach saturation in the UV–vis titration spectra. By
considering spherical AuNPs with an average diameter (d) of 12 nm, the number of gold atoms can be calculated according
to the formula: N = d3(πρ/6M), where ρ is the density
of fcc Au (19.3 g/cm3) and M is the atomic
weight (197 g/mol).33 The corresponding
coverages, in terms of peptide molecules for each AuNP, are about
1.2 × 107 and 2.4 × 107 for NGFpF and BDNFpF, respectively.

Because the molecular
dimensions of NGFpF and BDNFpF are 2.7 ×
1.7 × 2.0 nm3 and 3.2 ×
1.7 × 1.6 nm3, respectively, the ideal nanoparticle
coverage by the peptides (in terms of peptide molecules/AuNP) ranges
from ∼85 to ∼130 for NGFpF and from ∼88
to ∼170 for BDNFpF in the two limit side-on and
end-on configurations, respectively. Accordingly, “disordered”
multilayers of NGFpF molecules in side-on/end-on configuration
(Scheme 1a) and more
packed adlayers of BDNFpF molecules most likely in side-on
configuration can be figured out at the interface with AuNP (Scheme 1b).

Although
the stirring may also cause the coalescence of AuNPs and
a population of aggregated nanoparticles cannot be excluded, the characterization
of the pellets resuspended in the MOPS buffer evidences, however,
significant peptide-dependent differences, as demonstrated by zeta-potential
(ZP), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and atomic force microscopy
(AFM) analyses.

In particular, Table 1 shows that all of the peptide-immobilized
AuNPs display a comparable
surface charge neutralization but actual changes in the hydrodynamic
diameters.34,35

Indeed, negatively charged bare AuNPs exhibit a surface charge
decrease of about 30–40% in the MOPS buffer with respect to
the same particles dispersed in water, likely due to the partial charge
neutralization of citrate anions surrounding the metal core22 by the Na+ and K+ ions
used to fix the ionic strength of the buffer. A major charge decrease
(∼80%) of AuNPs is found after the interaction with the bare
lipid vesicles, whereas the measured charge is null for all of the
peptide/AuNP and peptide-PC/AuNP nanoparticles. This finding can be
explained on the basis of the cationic character of both peptides
(isoelectric pH of approximately 8–918) under the experimental conditions used.

Interestingly, the
hydrodynamic diameter of bare AuNPs (D = 26 ±
2 nm, in both water and the MOPS buffer) increases
differently for NGFpF/AuNP (250 ± 30 nm) and BDNFpF/AuNP (75 ± 3 nm). According to the UV–vis data
and the calculated nanoparticle coverage discussed above, these findings
confirm the picture of peptide molecule multilayers organized, respectively,
as extended (for NGFpF) and compact (for BDNFpF) adlayers at the interface with AuNPs.

Such a trend is also
observed for lipid-loaded SUVs, where NGFpF-PC exhibits
a higher average diameter (D = 122 ± 2 nm) than
BDNFpF-PC (D = 104 ± 3 nm), which
instead are comparable in size to control
SUVs without peptide (D = 108 ± 5 nm). Therefore,
NGFpF molecules tend to an extended end-on-like arrangement,
whereas BDNFpF molecules more likely lie flat on the leaflet
plane of the lipid membrane.

As to the hybrid peptide–lipid/AuNP
samples, hydrodynamic
diameters of 172 ± 28 nm for NGFpF-PC/AuNP (similar
to 173 ± 34 nm measured for POPC SUV/AuNP) and 83 ± 7 nm
for BDNFpF-PC/AuNP are found. A possible explanation is
that for the lipid-mediated interaction of NGFpF with AuNP
the lipids maintain their liposomal self-assembling state, whereas
in the case of BDNFpF, the interaction with the metal nanoparticle
can prompt the formation of different lipid supramolecular assemblies
(e.g., supported lipid bilayers, having a thickness of about 5 nm36).

The characterization of the peptide/AuNP
samples in air by AFM
analyses (Figure 2),
although affected by additional aggregation effects because the samples
were deposited on mica and dried, confirms, however, the actual nanoparticle
coating by the peptides. In fact, from the height analysis of the
particles, the average size of bare AuNPs (∼12 nm) increases
up to ∼16 and ∼20 nm for NGFpF/AuNP and BDNFpF/AuNP, respectively. As to the peptide–lipid/AuNP
samples, no relevant features could be detected on the solid-deposited
samples, as the samples suffered the substrate effect on lipid assembly36 (Figure S4).

NGFpF/AuNP, and (c) BDNFpF/AuNP. Z scale = 20 nm. Insets show the corresponding phase images.

The physicochemical characterization
of the NGFpF/AuNP
and BDNFpF/AuNP samples provided by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) further confirms the results obtained for the hybrid
interfaces formed for the two peptides (Figure 3), with significant differences found for
the peptide-immobilized samples with respect to bare AuNPs (Figure S5 and Table S1).

Figure 3 XPS peaks of C 1s for (a) NGFpF/AuNP, (b) NGFpF, (c) BDNFpF/AuNP, and (d) BDNFpF.

For the peak-fitting analysis of C 1s, the following
four components
are considered: C1 (at a binding energy (BE) of 285.0 eV),
due to C–C and C–H hydrocarbon bonds; C2 (at
a BE of 286.2 ± 0.2 eV), assigned to heterocarbon C–O
and C–N bonds; and C3 and C4 (at BEs
of 288.2 ± 0.2 and 289.0 ± 0.2 eV, due to C=O and
C(=O)OH groups, respectively).37

Intrinsic structural differences due to the primary peptide
sequence
are clearly displayed in the carbon peak components found for NGFpF (Figure 3b) and BDNFpF (Figure 3d). In fact, the ratio of polar to apolar components
((C2 + C3 + C4)/C1) exhibited
by the former and the latter are 1.3 and 3.2, respectively, according
to the two extra amino acids in the NGFpF sequence and
also two more phenylalanine residues in comparison with BDNFpF, which instead encompasses both one carboxylic residue and one
guanidine extra residue.

Interestingly, the comparison of C
1s spectra for NGFpF/AuNP (Figure 3a)
and BDNFpF/AuNP (Figure 3c) samples suggest that the BDNF peptide molecules
bind to the gold surface predominantly through the guanidine, carbonyl,
and carboxyl groups (i.e., strong decrease of C2, C3, and C4 components, respectively), according to
the picture of molecules lying at the interface in the extended side-on
arrangement. In the case of the NGF peptide, a minor change in the
peak shape can be an indicator of a more localized interaction among
certain sites of the peptide sequence and the AuNP, which results
in a less ordered hybrid interface.

To test the transport of
neurotrophin-peptide-functionalized AuNPs
across the BBB, a cellular model of immortalized human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (iHBMECs) was used. The HBMEC model is representative
of human brain endothelium and exhibits barrier properties comparable
to other BBB models.38 First, cell viability
was assessed to verify that the various peptide/lipid/AuNP assemblies
were nontoxic under the experimental conditions used. No toxicity
was found up to 24 h of cell treatment (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Viability assay on iHBMECs for samples (1) NGFpF, (2)
BDNFpF, (3) POPC SUV, (4) NGFpF-PC, (5) BDNFpF-PC, (6) AuNP, (7) NGFpF/AuNP, (8) NGFpF-PC/AuNP, (9) BDNFpF/AuNP, (10) BDNFpF-PC/AuNP,
and (11) POPC SUV/AuNPs. Statistical significance *p < 0.05 vs control.

Second, as it is well known that AuNPs are capable of crossing
the BBB,15 the effect of the nanoparticle
functionalization was here scrutinized in terms of cell internalization
by the various peptide/lipid/AuNP assemblies, to find differences
(if any) depending on the peptides and/or the immobilization approaches,
for example, direct or lipid-mediated adsorption, used for tailoring
the AuNPs.

Figure 5 shows the
representative images of laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM)
for cells incubated for 2 h with NGFpF and BDNFpF (emitting in the green, due to Fam moieties): free (Figure 5a), immobilized on AuNPs by
direct adsorption (Figure 5b), loaded in rhodamine-labeled POPC SUVs (emitting in the
red; Figure 5c), and
immobilized on AuNPs by lipid-mediated adsorption (Figure 5d).

Figure 5 LSM images of iHBMECs
incubated for 2 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) with (a) NGFpF (or BDNFpF), (b) NGFpF (or BDNFpF)/AuNP, (c) NGFpF-PC (or
BDNFpF-PC), and (d) NGFpF-PC (or BDNFpF-PC)/AuNP. Scale bar = 20 μm. Each sample consists of merged
fluorescence images of nuclei (blue; DAPI, λex/em = 405/425–475 nm), peptides (green; Fam, λex/em = 488/500–530 nm), and lipids (red; rhodamine, λex/em = 543/550–650 nm) (top panels) and merged DAPI
emission and optical bright-field images (bottom panels).

An enhancement of peptide internalization by the
cells in the functionalized
AuNPs compared with both free peptides and peptide-loaded SUVs is
visible. Interestingly, for NGFpF/AuNP, a higher peptide
uptake (displayed by a diffuse green emission in the cytoplasm) and
intracellular aggregation of the AuNPs (dark spots in the optical
micrograph; open arrows in Figure 5b) is found compared to that for BDNFpF/AuNP.
This latter exhibits a more localized distribution (dotted green emission),
with a preferential localization at the cell membrane (solid arrow
in Figure 5b). As to
NGFpF-PC/AuNP and BDNFpF-PC/AuNP systems, the
cellular internalization is comparable for both peptides, with green
spots co-localizing with the AuNPs, also in the nuclei.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we set up a new promising approach
to develop a “tunable”
multifunctional platform based on a neurotrophin-like potential drug
(NGF and BDNF peptides) and a plasmonic/fluorescence image-contrast
working principle. A modulation in the peptide immobilization was
demonstrated by a comparative study (by UV–vis, AFM, DLS, and
ZP analyses) of direct and lipid-mediated peptide–AuNP interaction.
Further physicochemical and biological (including in vivo test) studies
on these hybrid nanobiointerfaces will be necessary to accurately
control the subcellular localization of the drug and to quantify the
actual capability of crossing the BBB.

4 Experimental
Methods
4.1 Materials
Ultrapure Milli-Q water
(resistivity > 18 MΩ cm–1) was used for
all
experiments. Glassware was cleaned immediately before use by immersing
in aqua regia (HCl:HNO3, 3:1 volume ratio), followed by
rinsing with copious amount of water. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4) and trisodium citrate dihydrate (Na3C6H5O7· 2H2O, TSC) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.1.1 Buffers
The
phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution (pH = 7.4 at 25 °C) was prepared by dissolving
PBS tablets (0.01 M phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich) in ultrapure water. The MOPS buffer solution (added
with 0.27 mM KCl and 13.7 mM NaCl) was prepared at a concentration
of 1 mM, with pH corrected to 7.4 (25 °C).

4.1.2 Peptides
The N-terminal fragments
(1–14) of NGF (NGF1-14) and (1–12) of BDNF (BDNF1-12)
peptides39,40 were purchased from Caslo (Lyngby, Denmark)
as lyophilized powders (purity > 95%).

To dye-label the peptide with the fluorescein
(Fam) group (λex/λem = 488/520 nm),
a lysine (Lys) was added at the C-terminus of the peptides sequences,
to obtain SSSHPIFHRGEFSV-K-Fam (named NGFpF) and HSDPARRGELSV-K-Fam
(named BDNFpF). Stock peptide samples were prepared at
a concentration of 10–3 M in Milli-Q water and stored
at −20 °C.

4.1.3 Lipids
1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and rhodamine-labeled
1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(Rhod-DHPE) phospholipids
in chloroform were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL).

4.2 Preparation of SUV and
Peptide/SUV Systems
A chloroform solution of POPC (5 mg/mL)
and Rhod-DHPE (1 wt %)
was taken in a round-bottom flask, and, after evaporating the solvent
under argon flow, the dried lipid film formed on the wall of the flask
was emulsified in PBS (to obtain SUV) or 0.5 mM peptide solution in
PBS (to obtain N-Fam/SUV or B-Fam/SUV) and vortexed. The lipid dispersions
were therefore extruded 13 times through a 100 nm polycarbonate membrane,
followed by another 13 times through a 30 nm membrane (Avanti Polar
Lipids).

To remove unloaded peptide molecules from the peptide/SUV
systems, Amicon Ultra-0.5 ultracentrifuge filters (Sigma-Aldrich)41 were used to centrifuge (14 000 rpm for
30 min at 25 °C) and the recovered solutions were characterized
(Figure S1). The SUV and peptide/SUVs were
stored under Ar and used within 2 weeks, according to an established
protocol.42

4.3 Preparation
of Hybrid Peptide(/SUV)/AuNP
AuNPs were synthesized by chemical
reduction of HAuCl4 (1 mM) with
TSC (1 wt %). The plasmonic band centered at 518 nm and the full width
at half-maximum of about 50 nm confirmed the formation of monodisperse
spherical gold colloids with a diameter of 12 nm.43,44 N-Fam(/SUV)/AuNP and B-Fam(/SUV)/AuNP were prepared by adding 10–6 M peptide (or peptide-loaded SUV) solutions to AuNP
at a concentration of 2.2 nM in 1 mM MOPS. After vigorous stirring
and about 5 min of incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged (8000
rpm for 15 min at 25 °C); the recovered pellets were redissolved
in 1 mM MOPS and used for the characterization as well as cell treatments.

4.4 Physicochemical Characterization
4.4.1 UV–Vis
A Jasco V-650 spectrophotometer
was used, with quartz cuvettes having an optical path length of 1
cm.

4.4.2 DLS and ZP
A NanoPartica SZ-100
apparatus equipped with a 514 nm “green” laser from
HORIBA Scientific was used. Reproducibility was verified by collection
and comparison of sequential measurements in at least three separate
series of experiments. The samples were not filtered before measurements.
At least five measurements were made for each sample and data averaged.

4.4.3 AFM
For AFM analyses, drops (20
μL) of the various peptide/AuNP samples were allowed to adsorb
at room temperature on freshly cleaved muscovite mica (Ted Pella,
Inc.). After 5 min, the mica surface was briefly washed with 100 μL
of ultrapure water, dried under a gentle nitrogen stream, and immediately
imaged. A Cypher AFM instrument (Asylum Research, Oxford
Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) operating in tapping or AC mode and
equipped with a scanner at an XY scan range of 30/40 μm (closed/open
loop) was used. Silicon tetrahedral tips mounted on 30 μm long
rectangular cantilevers were purchased from Olympus (AT240TS; Oxford
Instruments). The probes had a nominal spring constant of 2 N/m and
a driving frequency of 70 kHz. A number of images covering 1–5
μm2 surfaces were scanned, and the lengths of particles
were measured using a freehand tool in the MFP-3DTM offline section
analysis software. The same tool was used to measure the cross sections
of particles.

4.4.4 XPS
XPS measurements
were performed
using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe apparatus equipped with a monochromatic
Al Kα source (1486.7 eV). Typically, the pressure in the analysis
chamber was 5 × 10–9 torr. The dual-beam charge
neutralization method with electron (∼1 eV) and argon ion (<10
eV) guns was used for charge compensation. Au 4f, C 1s, O 1s, N 1s,
and S 2p signals were acquired at a constant pass energy and an analyzer
energy step of 23.5 and 0.2 eV, respectively. Fitting was then realized
with software provided by PHI, with preliminary Shirley background
subtraction. Each spectrum is referenced to a carbon pollution at
285.0 eV of BE. All BE values are given at ±0.2 eV.

4.5 Cellular Experiments
4.5.1 Cell Cultures
Monolayers of iHBMEC
(Innoprot, Elexalde Derio, Spain) were fed with endothelial basal
medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% endothelial cell
growth supplement, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.

4.5.2 Cell Viability Assays
To evaluate
cell viability in ECs, the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl
tetrasodium bromide (MTT) assay was used (Chemicon, Temecula, CA).
The cells (10 000 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates
and grown in complete medium, in the absence (control cells) or presence
of bare or peptide-functionalized AuNPs at a final concentration of
3 nM for 2 and 24 h. At the end of treatment, the cells were incubated
with MTT for 3 h, 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added, and
the absorbance was measured at 590 nm, as previously described.45

4.5.3 Model Experiment of BBB
Crossing by LSM
Analyses
At confluence, cells were split on glass-bottom
Petri dishes (WillCo Wells; glass diameter, 22 mm) pretreated with
a mixture of 30 ng/mL collagen and 10 ng/mL fibronectin (1 h, room
temperature), to allow cell adhesion (2 × 104 cells/well).
The day after, the cells were treated with the various samples at
a final concentration of 3.0 × 10–9 M of the
AuNPs. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed with the PBS
solution (10 mM PBS, 37 °C, pH = 7.4), fixed, and stained with
the nuclear dye DAPI (ThermoFisher).

LSM was performed with
an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with
diode UV (405 nm, 50 mW), multiline argon (457, 488, and 515 nm; total,
30 mW), HeNe(G) (543 nm, 1 mW), and HeNe(R) (633 nm, 1 mW) lasers.
An oil-immersion objective (60xO PLAPON) and spectral filtering system
was used. The detector gain was fixed at a constant value, and images
were taken, in a sequential mode, for all of the samples at random
locations throughout the area of the well.
