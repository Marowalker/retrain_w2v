In this work, we demonstrate a chemical
modification approach,
by means of covalent-bonding amphoteric poly-l-lysine (PLL)
on the interior nanopore surface, which could intensively protect
the pore from etching when exposed in the electrolyte under various
pH conditions (from pH 4 to 12). Nanopore was generated via simple
current dielectric breakdown methodology, covalent modification was
performed in three steps, and the functional nanopore was fully characterized
in terms of chemical structure, hydrophilicity, and surface morphology. I–V curves were recorded under a
broad range of pH stimuli to evaluate the stability of the chemical
bonding layer; the plotted curves demonstrated that nanopore with
a covalent bonding layer has good pH tolerance and showed apparent
reversibility. In addition, we have also measured the conductance
of modified nanopore with varied KCl concentration (from 0.1 mM to
1 M) at different pH conditions (pHs 5, 7, 9, and 11). The results
suggested that the surface charge density does not fluctuate with
variation in salt concentration, which inferred that the SiNx nanopore was fully covered by PLL. Moreover,
the PLL functionalized nanopore has realized the detection of single-stranded
DNA homopolymer translocation under bias voltage of 500 mV, and the
20 nt homopolymers could be evidently differentiated in terms of the
current amplitude and dwell time at pHs 5, 8, and 11.

1 Introduction
Nanopore
sensing is an ultra-sensitive, flexible, and label-free
approach for single-molecule measurement and DNA sequencing.1−11 In the past decade, the single-nanometer-scale pores demonstrated
great capability for the detection, identification, and characterization
of a variety of analytes, such as nanoparticles,12−17 and biomolecules like bacteria,18 protein,19−26 antibody,27,28 nucleic acid,29−32 DNA,33−35 RNA,36,37 and so on. In this approach, a membrane with a nanopore was sandwiched
in a flow cell containing an electrolyte solution, and the analytes
(usually some charged molecules or particles) were driven to translocate
through the nanopore by applying an electric field across the monolayer
membrane, during which a temporary resistive pulse was produced for
the characterization of molecular information of analytes.

Solid-state
nanopores exhibited remarkable chemical, thermal, and
mechanical stability and extraordinary versatility in terms of the
size, shape, and surface properties, as well as structural robustness
compared with their biological counterparts.38,39 A large number of researches have been reported on DNA sequencing
with solid-state nanopores based on different substrates, such as
silicon oxide,40−42 silicon nitride (SiNx),43−46 aluminum oxide,47,48 molybdenum sulfide,49−52 boron nitride,53−56 graphene,57,58 and polymer,59,60 whereas other work was also displayed by means of nanotube61−66 and nanochannel.67−71 Nanopore fabrication technologies along with a wide range of supporting
membrane materials have been intensively developed, including electric
beam lithography, ion beam sculpting, track-etch technique, focused-ion-beam
milling, and dielectric current breakdown.72−81 Our group has successfully generated nanopore with tunable diameter
on silicon nitride and graphene based on dielectric breakdown methodology,
and eventually realized the detection of short single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) homopolymers and tetracycline; a theoretical simulation of
the ion transport properties in the pore channel has also been investigated
in the light of Poisson and Nernst–Planck equation.82−85

To further exploit the application of abiotic nanopore toward
tailoring
single nucleotide resolution and specific target sensing, numerous
modification strategies (containing covalent bonding86−93 and physical absorption94−98) have been employed to help the understanding of fundamental chemical
interactions at the nanoscale/single-molecule level and modulate the
surface properties as well. In the present work, we displayed the
design, preparation, characterization, and application of a synthetic
nanopore based on SiNx membrane by covalent
attachment of hydrophilic, positively charged poly-l-lysine
(PLL) on the wall of nanopore. The high biocompatibility and pH sensitivity
of amphoteric PLL provide an insight for further investigation of
the interaction between DNA and protein with the nanopore fabricated
by the dielectric breakdown.99,100 The chemical modification
procedure was performed in three steps according to the reported procedure,101 complete characterizations have been implemented
for the modified nanopore. We have looked into the influence of conductance
by varying the concentration and pH value of the electrolyte in situ
and unveiled the correlation of conductance and surface properties
of modified nanopores with salt concentration and pH value. The PLL-coated
nanopore was applied ultimately for short ssDNA recognition under
500 mV as the input voltage.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication, Modification, and Characterization
of SiNx Nanopore
This work was
performed based on the SiNx membrane on
which nanopore was generated via a current-stimulus dielectric breakdown.
The freshly prepared nanopore underwent three steps of chemical reactions,
the buffer or water rinse was applied for each step to remove the
excess reactants and any physical absorption on the interior surface.

In terms of the characterization of the modified functional groups
on nanopore, IR was firstly applied to check the characteristic groups
of the chemical skeleton. Unfortunately, the expected absorption for
−NH– and C=O stretch was not observed, this might
be due to the very limited amount of functional molecules on the chip
surface, which exhibits an extremely low absorption, and is thus invisible
on the IR spectrum. Also, the hydrophilicity evidently increased after
the modification based on the contact angle, as presented in Figure S1. Other characterizations such as energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have
been applied for the element analysis of the modified and unmodified
surface (Tables S1 and S2). The comparative
results demonstrated that elements C and N were increased on the modified
surface than on the bare one because of the introduction of abundant
aliphatic groups on both the surface and inside the nanopore; elements
O and Si were decreased, as these two elements were not the main components
of the modified structure and thus occupied less percentage of the
total elements on the modified nanochip than on the bare one. Although
change in the value is different, the variation tendency is consistent
between the two techniques. Optical property was examined by Raman
spectroscopy, the result displayed no obvious distinction for the
modified and unmodified chips. Both atomic force microscopy (AFM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technologies have been
employed to analyze the surface topography and morphology of modified
nanochip. The little white particles with an average height of 1.4
nm in Figure 1B revealed
the agglomeration of PLL chain on a dry nanopore surface, which differs
from the relatively clearer bare chip surface in Figure 1A. Also, the TEM images demonstrated
a characteristic size difference before (16 nm, Figure 1C) and after the covalent modification of
the nanopore (11 nm, Figure 1D); a white ring observed at the periphery of nanopore indicated
that the functional layer was immobilized around the pore.

2.2 Investigation of the Stability
of Modified
Nanopore
I–V characterization
was conducted on a patch clamp amplifier for the freshly modified
nanopore mounted on the fluidic setup with a buffer solution of pH
8. The pore diameter was estimated based on an empirical formula:102 1  

In the formula,
σ is the electrical
conductivity (normally 11.93 S/m for 1 M KCl, pH 8), L is the thickness of SiNx membrane (20
nm in this work), G stands for the pore conductance,
and d represents the pore diameter. The diameter
of a bare SiNx nanopore (all of the diameters
presented in the text were calculated according to the aforementioned
formula) reduced from 3.5 nm to approximately 1 nm after covalently
bonding PLL on the interior surface; the I–V curve was collected discontinuously for this pore during
more than a month to monitor the variation in pore size with time
under the same condition. As correlation between the slope of I–V curve and the nanopore size
is reported, the greater the slope, the larger the pore size; so,
we could intuitively deduce the size change from the I–V curve. Figure 2 displays the I–V characterization acquired on the unmodified and PLL-modified
SiNx nanopores. The slope of the curves
illustrated that nanopore significantly dwindled after PLL modification;
it turned to approximately 1 nm and sustained for more than a month. Figure S2 demonstrates the correlation between
modified nanopore size and time. The diameter maintained at around
1 nm for a month, but slightly enlarged to above 1 nm afterward, which
might be on account of the damage during frequent electrolyte/water
exchange for detection and storage. This work was scaled up on tens
of PLL-modified nanopores and proved to be a reliable modification
procedure for further application on other nanopore substrates.

Figure 2 I–V curves of unmodified
and PLL-modified SiNx nanopore after a
month (black: bare SiNx nanopore; red:
PLL-modified nanopore; blue and violet: PLL-modified nanopore after
10 and 30 days).

2.3 pH Tolerance
of Modified SiNx Nanopore
Poly-l-lysine (PLL) is a type
of amphoteric amino acid with a pKa value
of 9. Its introduction on the wall of SiNx nanopore could potentially realize the rectification of ion current
and surface charge of the interior pore at different pH conditions.
To testify the stability of chemical bonding layer, the I–V curves were recorded with a broad range
of pH stimuli (from 4 to 12) with 1 M KCl. The results in Figure S3 indicate that the slope of I–V curves of modified nanopore
does not change significantly at the pH from 4 to 8, but gradually
became larger under very basic condition (pH from 9 to 12), presumably
owing to the polarity switch of the modified nanopore from acidic
to basic condition. Furthermore, the I–V curve returns to the initial status when switching the
pH value to 8. It could be elucidated that the covalent layer prevents
the nanopore from etching by alteration of pH value. Table S3 summarizes the details of pore size at different
pHs with 1 M KCl as the electrolyte. It is worth mentioning that no
current rectification was observed on the fundamental characteristics
of the current response between bare and PLL-bonded nanopore, which
might depend on the surface charge and nanopore geometry.

2.4 Ionic Conductance Behavior and Surface Charge
Dependence of PLL-Modified Nanopore
To disclose the correlation
of amphoteric PLL and surface charge property of functional pore with
the salt concentration and pH condition, we have recorded the I–V curves for the modified pore
with varying KCl concentration (0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM, and 1
M) at each pH condition (pHs 5, 7, 9, and 11). Figure 3 depicts the conductance versus KCl concentration
for modified pore (pore size was calculated to be around 2.5 nm according
to formula 1) at four
pH conditions. The conductance of the device at all of the four pH
conditions matches that of the model described as fixed charge density
behavior.102−105 The experimentally extracted conductance of the modified pore does
not fluctuate at low salt concentration but gradually increases with
the augmentation of salt concentration at all of the four pH conditions;
presumably, the surface charge is dominated by PLL at low salt concentrations.

with a pore size of around 2.5 nm, which measured at varied KCl concentrations
under four pH conditions. The two solid lines are derived from the
models called as a fixed charge density (red) and bulk behavior (green);
the dash lines stand for the status that is close to the fixed charge
density model.

2.5 Short
ssDNA Homopolymers Translocation through
PLL-Modified SiNx Nanopore
The
SiNx nanopore fabricated by the dielectric
breakdown approach was subsequently modified by the covalent bonding
PLL and applied afterward for the detection of 20 nt short homopolymers
(with chain length of around 7 nm). Figure 4 displays the baseline and current blockades
determined for 10 pM of single-stranded poly(dG)20, poly(dT)20 from a PLL-modified SiNx nanopore
with 500 mV as the applied voltage in the buffer solution of 1 M KCl,
pH 8. The original translocation during 20 s is provided in Figure S4; the observed open-pore current is
around 700 pA. The presented stochastic set of downward spikes in Figure 4B inferred the translocation
of single-molecule DNA homopolymer through the nanopore (Figure 4A is the baseline
ionic current without the addition of analytes), and the amplified
blockade shown alongside (Figure 4C) indicated that the current amplitude for poly(dT)20 is higher than that for poly(dG)20 at pH 8. This
was further exhibited by the histograms in Figure 5, which were extracted from hundreds of events
of the two homopolymers at pHs 5, 8, and 11, the mean current amplitudes,
and the corresponding dwell time (Figure 6, with the fitting method of exponential
decay) for poly(dG)20 and poly(dT)20 at the
three different pH conditions listed in Table 1. It is not difficult to discover that the
current amplitude for poly(dG)20 is higher than that for
poly(dT)20, which is consistent with their physical dimension,
except in the case pH 8, when the current amplitude for poly(dG)20 is 208.9 ± 2.4 pA, lower than that for poly(dT)20 (254.1 ± 4.7 pA). At pH 8, which is near the isoelectric
point of PLL, the modified surface is close to neutral. The lower
surface charge together with the conformation of G may be responsible
for the smaller current blockade; in addition, base current was also
significantly influenced by the distinction of surface charges under
diverse pH. Furthermore, the current amplitude decreases with increasing
pH value. This could be explained by the fact that under acidic condition,
the interaction of the positively charged PLL with the negatively
charged DNA is stronger. The DNA probably showed a more complicated
conformation rather than a straight chain, thus exhibiting a higher
current amplitude during translocation.

Table 1 Details of Current Amplitude and Dwell
Time for poly(dG)20 and poly(dT)20 at pHs 5,
8, and 11
 	current
amplitude (pA)	dwell time (ms)	
pH variation	poly(dG)20	poly(dT)20	poly(dG)20	poly(dT)20	
pH 5	421.7 ± 3.0	320.2 ± 2.6	0.54 ± 0.03	1.02 ± 0.10	
pH 8	208.9 ± 2.4	254.1 ± 4.7	0.66 ± 0.03	0.94 ± 0.02	
pH 11	229.2 ± 0.9	181.6 ± 1.0	0.83 ± 0.08	0.82 ± 0.10	
Moreover, the corresponding dwell time has a similar tendency as
the current blockade for poly(dT)20, whereas it is inverse
for poly(dG)20, probably due to the conformation diversity of G-quadruplexes.106 It has been reported that ions and pH have
the largest effects on the formation of the G-quadruplex.107 In addition, the translocation rate in our
system is around 50 μs per base according to the values presented
in Table 1, which signifies
the existence of a significant interaction of DNA with the covalent
bonding PLL on the wall of nanopore; here, the translocation rate
has been increased more than an order of magnitude compared with our
previously reported results.82,84 We anticipate that
our further work will be the exploration of this modification technique
on other nanopore substrates.

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Materials
The nanochips (SiNx membrane growing on both sides of the silica
substrate and free standing on top of window) were purchased from
Nanopore Solution, Portugal, with the thickness of 20 nm and the window
size of 10 μm × 10 μm. 3-(Triethoxysilyl) propylamine,
glutaraldehyde (25% solution in H2O), poly-l-lysine
(PLL, Mw 1000–5000), methanol anhydrous
were ordered from Aldrich, Shanghai. Phosphate buffer was prepared
by using monopotassium phosphate and dipotassium phosphate obtained
from Admas, Shanghai. Sulfuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and ethanol
absolute were obtained from Admas, Shanghai. All of the chemicals
and solvents were used as received without any further treatment.
HPLC-grade water was from Molecular 1850D.

3.2 Method
of Covalent Modification of PLL
The experiment was carried
out on the nanochip with a free-standing
SiNx membrane. First, the nanopore was
fabricated on SiNx membrane via the electric
pulse breakdown approach by embedding the chip in flow cell, which
was filled with electrolyte of 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 M KCl, and
1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, pH 8) and by using Ag/AgCl
as a reference electrode. Second, the freshly prepared nanopore was
treated with piranha solution for 30 min followed by rinsing with
deionized water to clean and simultaneously introduce hydroxyl group
on the interior nanopore surface. The schematic diagram of the chemical
modification of SiNx nanopore by PLL is
displayed in Scheme 1.

Afterwards, the chip with nanopore was soaked in 5% of
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
anhydrous methanol solution for 30 min, followed by washing with ethanol
absolute before treating with 5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.4) for 1 h and then washing with PBS. The
terminated aldehyde group on the wall of the nanopore was finally
cross-linked with the lateral amine group on polylysine (Mw 1000–5000, 1 mg/mL) in PBS for 2 h, followed
by rinsing with PBS at 50 °C to remove the physically absorbed
PLL on the interior pore surface, and finally washed with deionized
water for the subsequent use.

3.3 Characterizations
and Measurement
The modified nanopore was characterized in
terms of chemical structure
(IR, Agilent Cary 630), element analysis (EDS, JSM-7800F, and XPS,
Escalab 250Xi), optical properties (Raman, inVia Reflex), surface
morphology (AFM, Brucker Dimension EDGE, and TEM, FEI tecnai F20),
and hydrophilicity (Contact Angle, DSA100). Electric pulse breakdown
was performed on a Keithley 2450 equipment, which was controlled by
a Labview program to measure the conductivity of the SiNx membrane through current–voltage (I–V) curves. I–V characteristics and ion current blockade measurements
were recorded on a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B) with the
supersensitive electronics housed inside a Faraday cage.

3.4 Stability of Modified Nanopore
The
polylysine-modified nanopore was investigated in terms of the stability
of the covalent coating layer under varied pH conditions. Nanochip
with functional nanopore generated by electric pulse breakdown was
assembled inside a PET or Teflon flow cell. Electrolyte containing
10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 M KCl, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8) was filled in
both reservoirs (cis and trans) before the insertion of Ag/AgCl electrode,
which was connected to the resistive feedback amplifier. The I–V curves were recorded over 30
days without changing the pH value and electrolyte concentration and
increasing the voltage from −200 mV to +200 mV, at a scanning
rate of 50 mV/min. Moreover, the pH gradient (from 4 to 12) has been
employed during I–V characterization.
Conductance was measured with electrolyte concentration varying from
0.1 mM to 1 M. Finally, 10 pM of two single-stranded homopolymer nucleotides,
poly(dG)20 and poly(dT)20, were respectively
introduced into the cis reservoir for translocation detection under
bias voltage of 500 mV at pHs 5, 8, and 11.

4 Conclusions
To sum up, we have presented the integration
of positively charged
amino acid PLL into SiNx nanopore via
covalent bonding and have performed overall characterization for functional
nanopore. The stability of chemical coating layer of nanopore has
been evaluated under variation of pH value by measuring the I–V curves on the patch clamp. An
obvious tendency was observed that the size of PLL bonding nanopore
remains unchanged under acidic conditions but enlarged gradually at
pH above 9, which depends on the surface charge and polymer extension.
This process was reproducible and it has been demonstrated that the
nanopore size is reversible when the pH value decreases down to the
acidic range. The functional nanopore was extremely stable and could
remain unchanged evidently for a month. We have investigated the salt
dependence of modified nanopore conductance and discovered that our
device followed a fixed charge density model in a low-salt regime.
The modified pore was ultimately employed for the detection of ssDNA
homopolymer translocation under bias voltage of 500 mV, thereby realizing
the distinction between the 20 nt homopolymers by ionic current amplitude
and dwell time. Furthermore, the amphoteric PLL on the wall of nanopore
showed virtually no current rectification in this system, whereas
it could provide an insight into further investigation of the interaction
between DNA and protein and suggest future applications in biosensor
technology.
