The
method capable of simultaneously detecting multiple target
bacterial pathogens is necessary and of great interest. In this research,
we demonstrated our initial effort to simultaneously detect seven
common foodborne bacteria by developing a straightforward upconversion
fluorescence sensing approach. The fluorescent nanosensor was constructed
from a designed guanidine-functionalized upconversion fluorescent
nanoparticles (UCNPs@GDN), tannic acid, and hydrogen peroxide (HP)
and could quantify pathogenic bacteria in a nonspecific manner because
the luminescence of the upconversion fluorescent nanoparticle was
effectively strengthened in the presence of bacteria. When the developed
nanosensor was applied to quantify multiple bacteria including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Cronobacter sakazakii, Shigella flexneri, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, a linear range of 103 to 108 cfu mL–1 and a detection
limit of 1.30 × 102 cfu mL–1 have
been obtained for the seven model mixture bacteria. In addition, the
similar linear range and detection limit were also obtained for the
detection of single bacteria. The present approach also exhibited
acceptable recovery values ranging from 70.0 to 118.2% for bacteria
in real samples (water, milk, and beef). All these results suggested
that the guanidine-functionalized upconversion fluorescent nanosensor
could be considered as a promising candidate for the rapid detection
and surveillance of microbial pollutants in food and water.

1 Introduction
Pathogenic
bacteria plays a major role in a variety of human diseases,
it has been shown that Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Cronobacter
sakazakii, Shigella flexneri,Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria
monocytogenes are commonly encountered foodborne-disease-related
bacterial pathogens, which are the closest hazard source associated
with public health worldwide.1−6 The extensive use of antibiotics leads to these drug-resistant pathogens
presented in food and water, which causes serious infectious diseases,
with high medical cost and mortality rate.3,7 Therefore,
real-time screening and surveillance for various foodborne pathogens
enable the reduction of disease outbreaks and ensure food safety.
At present, conventional colony culture and counting are widely applied
as the current gold-standard method to estimate the number of viable
bacteria in various samples.8 In addition,
nucleic acid-based methods and immunology-based methods are also utilized
as sensitive and specific detection techniques.8−10 With the development
of affinity reagents such as antibody, antibiotic, phage, aptamer,
and peptide, many molecular recognition based methods have also been
constructed for the rapid screening of pathogenic bacteria.11−15 Despite these merits, these techniques suffer from problems such
as taxing, time-consuming, tedious sample pretreatment, expensive
instrumentation, and professional operation, which make them impossible
to meet the need of the rapid quantitative determination of multiple
pathogens. Thus, a compelling and urgent need exists to improve the
current methods for quickly sensing various pathogenic bacteria.

Nowadays, approaches capable of detecting pathogenic bacteria such
as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, electrochemical techniques,
and fluorescent techniques have received great attention.16−19 Among them, approaches based on optical sensing materials have been
attracting much attention for the past few years, especially, driven
by the rapid development and application of novel nanomaterials such
as gold nanoparticles, gold nanorods, quantum dots, silica nanoparticles,
and magnetic nanoparticles. These approaches have advantages over
conventional approaches that include simplicity, rapidness, low cost,
excellent stability, high selectivity, and sensitivity.20−26 It is worth noting that upconversion fluorescent nanoparticles (UCNPs),
which have been widely applied in the fields of sensor, biology imaging,
and photodynamic therapy, are attracting more and more attention because
of emitting visible luminescence under near-infrared (NIR) excitation,
multicolor tunable property, excellent photo-stability, negligible
background fluorescence, narrow emission spectrum, and less toxic
elements.27−32 Sensors based on integration UCNPs with biomolecules such as antigen,
antibody, and aptamer have been successfully constructed for sensing
bacteria with high sensitivity and specificity.33−38 However, these approaches are still greatly challenging, especially
when applied to the simultaneous detection of multiple bacteria. Moreover,
most of the biomolecules still suffered poor stability, fabricating
cost, short shelf lifespan, and strict storage conditions.10,39

Here, we report a straightforward upconversion fluorescence
sensing
approach for the simultaneous detection of seven common foodborne
bacteria, although a fiber probe for the simultaneous sensing labeled E. coli and S. aureus based amino-functionalized UCNPs have been previously reported.40 In consideration of the fact that the natural
materials with a spherical or discal shape such as yeast cells, human
cell, cyanobacteria, and diatoms have the ability to focus light for
fluorescence enhancement.40 It is worth
noting that bacterium as a widespread natural materials, usually carried
the net negative surface charge,39−41 thus the positively
charged guanidine group, which has two parallel hydrogen donor sites
and is vital for the enzyme to bind anionic substrates in nature,42,43 is chosen as the recognition elements. The electrostatic interaction
or hydrogen bond interactions could be potentially formed between
bacteria and the functional groups of nanoparticle surfaces. In addition,
tannic acid (TA) can be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (HP), and the
resulting product acts as a sensitizer and stabilizer in the sensing
system. Our suggested upconversion fluorescent sensing approach provides
a straightforward strategy for the simultaneous broad-spectrum bacterial
quantitative determination and demonstrates its considerable capability
of bacterial quantification for complex real samples such as water,
milk, and beef.

2 Results and Discussion
Here, UCNPs@GDN integrated the advantages of UCNPs with guanidine
groups, which gave them a significant fluorescence emission under
the excitation of NIR light and a strong positive surface charge.
The results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that
UCNPs were hexagonal with a particle size of around 20 nm (Figure S1a), a thin layer of the guanidine group
based materials with a thickness of around 3 nm has been coated onto
the surface of UCNPs by the modification procedure, moreover, the
crystal morphology of UCNPs@GDN has no significant change (Figure S1b). The surface potential of UCNPs@GDN
is +36.8 mV, which is far stronger than that of UCNPs (Figure S1c). From the spectrum of Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), we can also observe that the characteristic absorption
peak at 1632.16 cm–1 arose from the C=N bond
stretching vibration of the guanidine group of UCNPs@GDN (Figure S2). All these results indicated that
the guanidine group has been well grafted onto the surface of UCNPs
materials. The reliability and stability of the signal output is quite
a critical factor in the fluorescence sensing system. No significant
fluorescence intensity change of UCNPs@GDN is found with the change
of the concentration of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), pH value, temperature, and storage time (Figure S3), indicating that the obtained UCNPs@GDN
have good environment adaptability.

UCNPs@GDN capable of producing
stronger fluorescence has been designed
as a sensor for the detection of bacteria. Simultaneously, the strongly
basic guanidine group was introduced onto the surface of UCNPs as
the main functional group, which could interact with various anions
via charge pairing interactions and/or hydrogen bonding. On the other
hand, the exterior surface of bacterial cells exhibited negative surface
charge and could potentially form electrostatic interactions with
the guanidine group carrying a positive charge. Indeed, the bacteria
could cause UCNPs@GDN to emit the stronger fluorescence, and the fluorescence
intensity was enhanced with the increment of the concentration of
bacteria from 105 to 109 cfu mL–1, which made it possible to quantify bacteria (Figure 1). We speculated that UCNPs strongly interacted
with bacteria, where the light could propagate and distribute along
with the bacteria. The output light could be focused by bacteria,
and cause the intensity gradient.40,44 Thus, the
fluorescence enhancement of UCNP materials was achieved in the presence
of bacteria.

Figure 1 Fluorescence emission spectrum of UCNPs@GDN (1.0 mg mL–1) treated with different concentrations of E. coli.

In order to further improve the sensitivity of the sensing
system,
HP and TA were also added into the system. Here, TA possesses multiple
phenolic hydroxyl groups that can be oxidized into multiple quinone
groups by HP.45−47 The quinone groups can form stronger interactions
with the amino group of the surface protein of bacteria and the guanidine
group of UCNPs@GDN than that of phenolic hydroxyl groups,48−50 and thus promote the interaction between bacteria and UCNPs@GDN
as the bridging groups and improve the fluorescence response of UCNPs@GDN
to bacteria. Compared Figure 2a with 2b, we can observe that only
TA was added into the system, the slight improvement of the fluorescence
response of UCNPs@GDN to bacteria was obtained. The reason may be
attributed to the facts that TA could interact with amino acids, proteins,
or/and polysaccharides on the surface of bacteria,51,52 On the other hand, phenolic hydroxyl of TA could connect with the
guanidine group via the hydrogen-bond interaction, which could bridge
bacteria and UCNPs@GDN to enhance the combination. However, only HP
was introduced into the system, the small reduction of the fluorescence
response was observed (Figures 2c and S4). The reason may be attributed
to the reduced interaction between UCNPs@GDN and bacteria. Because
HP can interact with the guanidine group of materials,53 which hampers the electric transformation from
UCNPs to guanidine groups. In addition, the groups on the surface
of bacteria can interact with HP,54 which
weakened the interaction with UCNPs@GDN. Thus, TA and HP were simultaneously
added into this system, a prominent fluorescence response of UCNPs@GDN
to bacteria was obtained (Figure 2d), which confirmed our speculation. These results
indicated that the present fluorescence nanosystem was enabled to
sensing bacteria more sensitively, and the schematic illustration
was showed in Figure 3.

In order to further optimize the sensing conditions, the
effects
of UCNPs@GDN, TA, HP, buffer system, and pH value on the fluorescent
signal of UCNPs@GDN were investigated in the presence/absence of E. coli, respectively. According to the results (Figure S5), UCNPs@GDN (1.0 mg mL–1), TA (4.0 mg mL–1), HP (5.0 M), HEPES buffer system,
(10 mM) and pH = 8.0 were chosen as the optimum detection conditions
for the subsequent experiments.

Here, seven common foodborne
pathogenic bacteria including E. coli, Salmonella, C. sakazakii, S.
flexneri, V. parahaemolyticus, S. aureus, and L.
monocytogenes were detected and quantified by the
suggested protocol, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the UCNPs@GDN fluorescence intensity increased
with the increase of E. coli or Salmonella content. The plot of fluorescence intensity
versus the logarithm of bacteria concentration showed a linear relationship
in the concentration range of 103 to 108 cfu
mL–1. The quantification of other pathogenic bacteria
also showed a linear range of 103 to 108 cfu
mL–1 (Figures S6–S10), and their regression equations and the limit of detection (LOD)
were listed in Table 1. (The LOD was determined as 3 SK–1, in which S is the standard deviation of control
measurements, and K is the slope of the linear equation).
These results obtained demonstrated that the established strategy
is superior to those of previous reports.18,55 The signal intensity caused by the seven bacteria was very close
at the same concentration, which might have resulted from the very
close quantity levels in bacteria cells. Thus, the uniform mixed bacteria
containing seven bacteria were assayed with the proposed protocol,
a good linear relationship was obtained by the plotting fluorescence
intensity versus the logarithm of bacteria concentration in the range
of 103 to 108 cfu mL–1 and
the regression equation could be described as Y =
−300.98 + 146.57X with a correlation coefficient
of 0.9902, the LOD for the uniform mixed bacteria was estimated to
be 1.3 × 102 cfu mL–1, which showed
the excellent detection ability and the application potential of the
UCNPs@GDN in quantifying the total number of bacteria (Figure 5).

In order to further evaluate
the application potential for sensing
bacteria, the environmental sample (tap water), and food sample (milk
and beef) were spiked with standard bacteria solutions and detected
by the present protocol, respectively. The recovery values were in
the range of 70.0–118.2% with a relative standard deviation
(RSD) of 4.3–9.9% (see in Tables 2 and S1–S7). Compared with previous reports, the present approach exhibited
advantages in target bacteria and response time (Table S8). These results revealed the application potential
of the proposed sensing strategy for bacteria in complex sample matrixes.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, a facile and rapid upconversion
fluorescent nanosystem
based on UCNPs@GDN has been developed for the simultaneous broad-spectrum
bacterial quantitative determination in food and water. Compared with
the traditional approach, the proposed sensing approach was highly
sensitive, low cost, and time-saving. The recovery study of bacteria
in spiked environmental and food samples demonstrated the application
potential of the present sensing approach for real sample detection.
This upconversion fluorescent sensing strategy could be extended to
detect other pathogenic bacteria, and more kinds of functionalized
UCNPs should be exploited for sensing of pathogenic bacteria.

4.2 Synthesis of UCNPs@GDN
UCNPs@GDN
were prepared as per the previous procedure.56 First, the oil-solvent UCNPs
were synthesized. 1 mM RE (CH3COO)3 [Y/Yb/Er
78:20:2] was dissolved in a three-necked flask with OA (6 mL) and
ODE (17 mL), and this system was kept at 160 °C for 30 min to
form a transparent solution under an argon atmosphere and vigorous
stirring. Next, the system was kept at room temperature for 1 h, and
10 mL methanol solution with NaOH (2.5 mM) and NH4F (4
mM) was dropwise added to keep for another 30 min. Then, methanol
was removed by heated evaporation at 70 °C. Subsequently, the
system was kept at 300 °C for 1 h with an argon atmosphere and
vigorous stirring, then cooled down to collect UCNPs via centrifugation
(12 186g, 10 min). The obtained materials
were washed with ethanol and dried in air. Second, UCNPs@NH2 were obtained by the inverse microemulsion method following the
procedure,56 UCNPs (0.03 M) were dispersed
into cyclohexane (18 mL) with Triton X-100 (0.3 mL). Subsequently,
ammonia solution (0.24 mL) and Triton X-100 (1.2 mL) were added under
ultrasonication for 20 min. Then, TEOS (40 μL) and APS (40 μL)
were dropwise added with stirring for 48 h. UCNPs@NH2 were
collected via centrifugation (12 186g, 10
min). Finally, standard hydrogen electrode (10 mg) and UCNPs@NH2 (10 mg) were dispersed in PB buffer (10 mM, 30 mL, pH = 8.0)
under stirring, and the system was heated to 70 °C for 3 h under
an argon atmosphere. And then the obtained UCNPs@GDN were washed with
water and ethanol twice, and dried in air.

4.3 Apparatus
UCNPs material fluorescence
spectra were measured on an F-2500 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi,
Japan) under the excitation of a 980 nm diode laser (1 W, continuous
wave with 1 m fiber). UCNP material morphologies were observer by
a JEOL 2010F (JEOL, Japan) TEM. UCNP material FT-IR spectra (4000–400
cm–1) in KBr were measured in a Vector 22 FT-IR
spectrophotometer (Bruker, Germany). Zeta potentials of UCNP material
were recorded in neutral water solution at room temperature with a
Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern). Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
absorption spectra were measured in a Shimadzu UV-2700 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).

4.4 Bacteria
Culture
Liquid cultures
of E. coli, Salmonella, S. aureus, C. sakazakii, and S. flexneri were grown and rocked
in 20 mL of the Luria Bertani broth, respectively. L. monocytogenes and V. parahaemolyticus were obtained by liquid cultures in 20 mL of the BHI broth and 20
mL of the nutrient broth with 3% NaCl, respectively. After incubation
at 37 °C for 24 h, the bacteria culture was centrifuged at 3000g for 5 min and washed with HEPES (10 mM, pH = 8.0) three
times to collect bacteria, and the model bacterial mixture was prepared
as the equal volume of seven bacteria, then the optical density value
of the bacteria solution was detected at 600 nm and reached 0.5 (109 cfu mL–1). The strains and their mixture
were diluted by ten-fold and applied as a standard stock for further
experiments. The plate counting method (reference: Food safety detection
methods of National Standards of the People’s Republic of China,
GB4789.2-2016)57 was applied to count as
the standard bacteria.

4.5 Optimization and Detection
Five main
factors have been optimized for the detection of bacteria including
the concentration of UCNPs@GDN, TA, HP, buffer system, and pH value. E. coli (108 cfu mL–1) has been adopted as the example bacteria. The obtained optimum
detection condition of the nanosensor system to quantify E. coli was also transferred to quantify S. aureus, Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, C. sakazakii, S. flexneri, V. parahaemolyticus, and the seven
model mixture bacteria, respectively. The diluted standard bacteria
were added to the nanosystem under the optimized conditions. And after
shaking (200 rpm) for 30 min, the fluorescence intensity was recorded,
and the fluorescence intensity at the peak of 550 nm was chosen for
statistical analysis.

4.6 Real Sample Preparation
and Measurement
Tap water, beef, and milk were chosen as
the real samples, respectively.
First, all the samples were sterilization under high temperature to
ensure no bacteria in these samples. For tap water, the standard strains
were directly added without any pretreatment. For beef, the standard
bacteria were added after homogenizing to remove sediment. For milk,
the samples were first diluted with pure water (1:100), and then the
standard bacteria were added. Both the plate count method and the
developed based assay were used to analyze the bacterial containing
samples, respectively.
