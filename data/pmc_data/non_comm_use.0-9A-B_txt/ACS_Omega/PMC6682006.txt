The
self-assembly of amyloid peptides (Aβ), in particular
Aβ1–42, into oligomers and fibrils is one
of the main pathological events related to Alzheimer’s disease.
Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of carbon monoxide-releasing
molecules (CORMs) to protect neurons and astrocytes from Aβ1–42 toxicity. In fact, CORMs are able to carry and
release controlled levels of CO and are known to exert a wide range
of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities at physiologically
relevant concentrations. In order to investigate the direct effects
of CORMs on Aβ1–42, we studied the reactivity
of CORM-2 and CORM-3 with Aβ1–42in
vitro and the potential inhibition of its aggregation by
mass spectrometry (MS), as well as fluorescence and circular dichroism
spectroscopies. The application of an electrospray ionization-MS (ESI-MS)
method allowed the detection of stable Aβ1–42/CORMs adducts, involving the addition of the Ru(CO)2 portion
of CORMs at histidine residues on the Aβ1–42 skeleton. Moreover, CORMs showed anti-aggregating properties through
formation of stable adducts with Aβ1–42 as
demonstrated by a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and MS analysis.
As further proof, comparison of the CD spectra of Aβ1–42 recorded in the absence and in the presence of CORM-3 at a 1:1 molar
ratio showed the ability of CORM-3 to stabilize the peptide in its
soluble, unordered conformation, thereby preventing its misfolding
and aggregation. This multi-methodological investigation revealed
novel interactions between Aβ1–42 and CORMs,
contributing new insights into the proposed neuroprotective mechanisms
mediated by CORMs and disclosing a new strategy to divert amyloid
aggregation and toxicity.

1 Introduction
The
aggregated forms of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) have a
significant correlation with a growing number of diseases, including
but not limited to neurodegeneration.1 Indeed,
the assembly of misfolded amyloid peptides into cytotoxic oligomeric
and β-sheet-rich fibrillar aggregates2 is one of the major pathological events that occur in the progression
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).3,4 The synaptotoxicity
of Aβ oligomers,5−8 along with their neurotoxicity and pro-inflammatory effects of Aβ
fibrils9 make targeting Aβ assembly
an interesting therapeutic approach to treat AD.10 The effects of Aβs are not restricted to neurons
as increasing evidence indicates a modulation of glia physiology.11−13 It has been reported that deposition of Aβs leads to an impairment
of astrocytic function14 and that astrocytes
may undergo atrophy and degeneration at the early stages of disease
progression in animal models of AD as a result of Aβ exposure.15,16 Because of their fundamental role in ionic homoeostasis and cell
regeneration, astrocyte dysfunction contributes to brain aging and
neurodegeneration. Recently, the use of endogenous molecules to protect
neurons from Aβ1–42 toxicity by modulation
of neuronal or glia processes has been explored. Carbon monoxide (CO)
is a well-established gaseous toxic molecule.17 Exposure to elevated levels of environmental CO is suggested to
promote cognitive decline.18 However, recently,
CO has received growing attention due to its ability to modulate an
array of cell signaling cascades pertinent to neurodegeneration.19−23 These studies have used a wide array of reagents to investigate
the role for CO: (1) heme oxygenase-1 induction; (2) CO releasing
molecules (CORMs); or (3) exposure to CO gas, highlighting a distinct
role for both endogenous and exogenous CO. These studies have demonstrated
the ability of CORMs to protect both neurons and astrocytes from Aβ1–42 toxicity in vitro(22,23) and have highlighted distinct cellular pathways involved in the
cytoprotective effects of CORMs. For example, exposure of astrocytes
to CO has been reported to result in a reduction of Aβ1–42 toxicity via inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production. In contrast, neuronal protection was facilitated
by CO suppression of AMP-activated kinase mediated by Aβ1–42.24 Based on these studies
and other reports,25,26 the opportunity of preventing
amyloid-induced cellular degeneration through the use of CO donors
or heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) induction22,23 deserves further
investigation.27 In this context, the present
work also aimed at assessing additional mechanisms responsible for
the reported CORM-mediated reduction of amyloid toxicity in living
cells.22,23 The use of CORMs such as CORM-2 and CORM-3
(Figure 1) precisely
suits this purpose. CORMs have been proposed as pharmaceutical agents
by Motterlini, Mann, and co-workers in 2002.28 Since then, the transition metal carbonyls, in particular CORM-3
and CORM-2, have been studied in detail.29 The biological and therapeutic activity of these compounds have
been largely assessed by in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies.30,31 Moreover, the water solubility and stability in air of CORM-3 make
it more suitable for therapeutic use. Previous studies have indicated
that CORM-3 has therapeutic benefits in several animal models for
a series of diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial
infarction.32,33 These studies also revealed an
important clinical feature of CORM-3; at therapeutic doses, no increase
of COHb (CO Hemoglobin) blood levels was detected. Starting from these
bases, other studies have been conducted in order to explain the mechanism
for the release of CO by CORMs.34−38

structures. Chemical structures of two widely used CORM molecules,
CORM-2 and CORM-3.

In addition, there is
a growing body of evidence indicating the
interaction of CORMs with distinct protein substrates.39−41 In particular, Santos-Silva and co-workers reported a rapid formation
of stable adducts between the His15 residue of lysozyme and the cis-Ru(CO)2 fragment of CORM-3 as the result
of the chloride ion, glycinate, and one CO loss (Figure 2).35 Silvas et al. demonstrated, by electrospray ionization-MS (ESI-MS)
studies, that the Ru carbonyl fragments of a [Ru(CO)3Cl2(1,3-thiazole)] species bind to the His15 residue of lysozyme.42 The same reactivity was also demonstrated for
some Ru-based CORMs with azole ligands.40 In both cases, data obtained by ESI-MS experiments were confirmed
by crystallographic studies. The collected evidence revealed the tendency
of Ru fragments to interact with the Nε2 of His15 of lysozyme.
Additional binding sites have been reported to be close to Asp and
Arg residues.40,42 The same reactivity was also
reported for the Ru complex fac-[Ru(CO)3(Cl2-N1-thz)] and Aβ peptide 1–28. Valensin et
al. highlighted by 1D NMR the interaction of this complex with the
three His residues located in the N-terminal domain of Aβ peptide.43

leading to the rapid formation of stable adducts between the protein
and the remaining Ru(CO)2.35

What makes the study of CORMs
interaction with Aβ and the
investigation of CORM anti-aggregating properties even more intriguing
is the presence of a metal cation in their structure. Indeed, since
the discovery and application of the most relevant platinum(II) complex, cis-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2], also
known as cisplatin,44,45 the development of metal complexes
addressed to different diseases including neurodegenerative disorders,
cancer, diabetes, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease has significantly
increased.46−48 From an AD perspective, the interest in Aβ-targeted
metal complexes as anti-AD agents has increased over the past two
decades.49−51 This is due to their appealing physiochemical properties
and is based on the finding that the amyloid plaques in AD patients
are enriched in transition-metal cations such as Cu, Fe, and Zn.52−55 The finding that the dyshomeostasis of such metal ions is correlated
with AD56−58 led to the metal ion hypothesis.59,60 Indeed, these cations possess a high binding affinity for Aβ
and their ability to mediate the aggregation process in vitro has been assessed.57,61,62 Moreover, they are also implicated in the production of ROS induced
by Aβ.63,64 Many metal complexes have been
used in AD as therapeutic, diagnostic, and theranostic agents. The
strategies adopted for transition-metal complexes toward modulation
of Aβ aggregation are different. Among them, the coordination,
oxidation, and hydrolysis of Aβ are the most common.65,66 The first metal complexes with anti-aggregating properties were
reported by Barnham and co-workers in 2008.50 They demonstrated that Pt2+-1, 10-phenantroline complexes
interacted with the N-terminal domain. The binding of Pt2+ to N-terminal histidine residues was shown. This formation of the
coordination adduct was able to influence the behavior of the Aβ
peptide. Brewer and co-workers studied many complexes containing Pt2+ and Ru2+ metal centers.67−69 Because of
their attractive biological features, ruthenium complexes are considered
a valid alternative to platinum-based ones.65 More recently, Messori and co-workers presented a Ru2+ complex able to protect cortical neurons against Aβ1–42 toxicity in an in vitro model.49 However, it has been shown that most of these complexes
possess a higher affinity for fibrils than for oligomers. The fact
that Aβ oligomers are the most toxic species pushes research
toward the discovery of new complexes targeting these species. Based
on these premises and to the awareness that one of the major strategies
pursued for AD is focused on the stabilization of the Aβ monomer
in its native non-amyloidogenic state,10,70,71 our aim was to explore the mechanism by which CORMs
3 and 2 (Figure 1),
or carbon monoxide, directly react with Aβ1–42 and stabilize the peptide in its native form, impeding the amyloidogenic
conformational transition and formation of toxic assemblies and fibrils.
We have previously reported that oxidized Aβ25–35 peptide is less prone to aggregation.72 The aggregation pathway was previously investigated by our group
in an Aβ1–42 kinetic aggregation study carried
out using a multi-methodological approach.73 Therefore, the ability of CO-releasing molecules to directly bind
to Aβ1–42 and affect Aβ conformational
transition and aggregation has been investigated here by mass spectrometry
(MS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and a thioflavin T (ThT)-based
fluorescence assay.

Each technique provides information
on the interaction of the Aβ
amyloid peptide with metal complexes during the different phases of
its aggregation.72−76 Liquid chromatograph–MS (LC–MS) experiments provided
evidence for the formation of some stable noncovalent adducts between
CORMs and plasma proteins.38 ESI-MS is
indeed one of the most suitable techniques used to characterize complexes
formed by metal compounds and proteins,77 in particular with the Aβ peptide.78−80 Consequently,
the main question that we address in this work is if CORMs can show
other functions in counteracting amyloid toxicity via a specific reactivity
with amyloid in addition to the reported beneficial CO effects mediated
by HO-1. Additionally, we investigated if CO could react with Aβ1–42 in a similar fashion as oxygen.

2 Results and Discussion
In order to study the CORMs/Aβ1–42 interaction,
we carried out a multi-methodological approach, which provides insights
into the stabilizing and anti-aggregating properties of amyloid interacting
molecules and allows elucidating their mechanism of action. As Aβ
toxicity is related to specific prefibrillary species,81 it is important to follow the kinetics of the
Aβ assembly. Many compounds are characterized in terms of interaction
with fibrils but not with prefibrillary species.82 Therefore, this multi-methodological approach can give
a more comprehensive view of the CORMs/Aβ interaction. For example,
the anti-aggregating properties of myricetin were shown by ThT-fluorescence
assay, whereas its ability to prevent structural changes in Aβ1–42 was confirmed by CD studies.73,74 Moreover, MS techniques allowed monitoring the modifications induced
by myricetin on the monomer and the first occurring Aβ1–42 self-assembly species.75 In brief, persistent
level of monomers and the decreased formation of ordered Aβ1–42 oligomeric aggregates in the presence of myricetin
were shown. In addition, these studies highlighted the oxidation of
the peptide at Met35 via formation of a sulfoxide that is less prone
to aggregation with a concomitant loss of cytotoxicity and decrease
in protein oxidation.75 Therefore, we applied
a similar multi-methodological approach and used myricetin as a reference
inhibitor. The choice of myricetin as the reference inhibitor is due
to its proven anti-aggregating properties. Moreover, its mechanism
of action was well characterized by different studies based on MS
and our multi-methodological approaches.72,73,75,76

2.1 Evaluation of Aβ1–42/CORM-3 Interaction
by MS
Evidence of CORMs protective effects
against Aβ1–42 toxicity in vitro and capacity to form stable adducts with histidine residues of different
proteins35 prompted us to investigate their
interaction with Aβ1–42 by MS analysis. Following
the experimental procedure previously reported by Bartolini et al.,74 Aβ1–42 was incubated
at 30 °C for 3 h in the absence and in the presence of either
CORM-2 or CORM-3 to achieve final CORM/Aβ1–42 molar ratios (MRs) ranging from 0.1 to 10 to gain insights into
the reaction of CORMs with the His residues of Aβ1–42.

In Figure 3a, the characteristic multicharged mass spectrum of native Aβ1–42 is shown. The analysis of the ESI-MS spectra exposed
the generation of different charge states of the monomer. The resulting
signals were attributed to Aβ1–42 charge states
ranging from 2 to 5 ions, the most intense being [M + 4H]4+ at 1129.3 m/z, [M + 5H]5+ at 903.7 m/z, and [M + 6H]6+ at 753.3 m/z (Figure 3a). The deconvoluted
MS spectrum of Aβ1–42, not treated with CORMs
(Figure 3b) shows an
intense signal at 4514 Da, which corresponds to the molecular weight
of the native form of the peptide. However, when Aβ1–42 was incubated with CORM-3 at higher concentration (CORM-3/Aβ1–42 = 10), new species at higher molecular weights
were detected (Figure 3c). The deconvoluted mass spectra revealed the addition of Ru(CO)2 to Aβ1–42. In particular, a mass
increment of 156 Da for the interaction of Ru(CO)2 to each
His residue was detectable, producing signals at 4670, 4826, and 4982
Da, related to the addition of 1, 2, and 3 Ru(CO)2 moieties,
respectively. These species derive from the formation of stable adducts
between Aβ1–42 and 1–3 Ru(CO)2 groups from CORM-3 (molecular weight of 156 Da). As the primary
sequence of Aβ1–42 contains three histidine
residues and CORMs are known to form stable adducts with this amino
acid,35 the Aβ1–42/CORMs reaction may reasonably occur at this level (Figure 2). The extent of Aβ1–42/CORMs adducts formation was found to be proportional
to CORM concentrations. Indeed, increased mono-, di-, and tri-modified
forms of the peptide (Figure 4b,c) were detected at increasing CORM-2 and CORM-3 concentration.
Indeed, compared to CORM-3, the disappearance of the native form of
Aβ1–42 required a lower CORM-2 concentration
(MR = 5 instead of 10; Figure 4b,c). At low CORM molar ratio, only the mono modified form
of Aβ1–42 is evident, with the native Aβ1–42 peptide concomitantly being transformed. By increasing
the CORM/Aβ1–42 molar ratio, peptide modification
was more pronounced, with the modification of the monohistidine-modified
form into bis- histidine- and tris-histidine-modified Aβ1–42 adducts (Figure 4). In particular, CORM-2 induced a complete disappearance
of the native Aβ1–42 form and the concomitant
formation of Aβ1–42-modified forms in which
two or three histidine residues are modified. This higher reactivity
of CORM-2 can be explained by the fact that two ruthenium moieties
are present in the CORM-2 structure, whereas CORM-3 bears only one.

μM) were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and analyzed by ESI-MS.
The Aβ1–42 species relative abundances were
derived from the deconvoluted ESI-MS spectrum.

2.2 Identification of Aβ1–42 Amino Acids Involved in the Formation of Stable Adducts with CORM-3
and CORM-2
A bottom-up approach was employed to assess the
Aβ1–42 amino acidic residues involved in the
formation of stable adducts with CORM-2 and 3. Aβ1–42 was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C in the absence and in the presence
of CORMs at final CORM/Aβ1–42 molar ratio
of 5 or 10 before digestion with trypsin. Peptides from the tryptic
digestion of untreated Aβ1–42 were all identified
(Figure 1, Supporting Information). Analysis of the tryptic
digests, resulting from incubation with CORMs, highlighted modification
only at peptide 6–16, independently from the type of CORM and
molar ratio. In particular, the mono-modified form of the peptide
6–16 (as di-charged form—m/z = 747.5) was detected after incubation with CORM-3 at
molar ratio equal to 5 (Figure 2, Supporting Information). The
identity of the adduct was confirmed by the characteristic ruthenium
isotope pattern, which perfectly matched that previously reported
by Hong and co-workers.83 MS/MS analysis
of this peptide allowed final identification of residue His6 as the
amino acid residue involved in Ru(CO)2 binding (Figure 3Supporting Information). This finding confirms the tendency
of ruthenium-containing molecules to form adducts with His residues
and to interact with binding sites close to Asp and Arg residues as
previously reported by others.40,42,43 The identification of the second amino acid residue involved in
the formation of the di-adduct was not possible because the di-modification
of the peptide drastically impacts the ionization efficiency and significantly
reduces signal intensity. The same phenomenon is also the cause of
not detecting the tri-modified peptide. However, as the modifications
occur at 6–16 peptide containing three histidine residues and
according to the data reported in literature,43 it is quite reasonable to assume that the second and the third modification
involve His 13 and 14.

2.3 Inhibition of Aβ1–42 Aggregation by CORM-3
After assessing
the capacity of CORMs
to form stable adduct with Aβ1–42, their anti-aggregation
capacity was evaluated. We have previously developed a reproducible
Aβ1–42 aggregation protocol, which allows
the characterization of different assembly species and a definition
of their morphology, molecular weight, and relative abundance.14 This information is crucial to avoid confusing
outcomes from both aggregation studies and screening of inhibitors.
Based on this multi-methodological approach,73 the effects of CORM-3 on Aβ1–42 aggregation
was monitored by different methodologies. ESI-MS was applied for the
quantification of monomers; CD spectroscopy was used to obtain information
on the secondary structure,74,76 and a ThT fluorescence
assay was applied to assess fibrils formation.84 The use of different techniques allows for a more comprehensive
analysis of increasingly complex interactions involved in prefibrillar
species formation during the aggregation process.85 Indeed, it was established that Aβ toxicity is related
to specific intermediates.81 In this study,
we employed the previously proposed multi-methodological approach
to follow the Aβ1–42 aggregation process over
time in the presence and in the absence of CORM-3 at different concentrations,
using myricetin as the reference inhibitor.

2.4 ESI-MS
Analysis
ESI-MS has been previously
used to highlight the noncovalent interaction of myricetin and other
inhibitors with the native peptide.72,73,75,76 Using this approach,
it was possible to characterize the inhibitors, determining their
potency (IC50) and their capacity to maintain the Aβ1–42 in its nonamyloidogenic, soluble monomeric form.
In the present study, our aim was to verify whether Aβ1–42/CORMs interaction could favor the stabilization of the nonamyloidogenic
soluble form. Hence, an ESI-MS-based approach was exploited for monitoring
the decrease of Aβ1–42 soluble monomers along
with the mono-, di-, and tri-Ru(CO)2-modified monomers
formation. In detail, Aβ1–42 (50 μM)
solution was incubated in the presence and in the absence of 50 μM
myricetin, 50 μM CORM-3, and 250 μM CORM-3. At selected
times, samples were analyzed by ESI-MS upon addition of reserpine
(30 μM) as an internal standard. In a time course experiment,
the aggregation was followed by monitoring the ratio between the sum
of all [M + 4H]4+ monomer species (native, mono, di-, and
tri-Ru(CO)2-modified) and the internal standard (IAβ1–42 monomers/IIs). The charge state 4 was selected
as it is endowed with the highest intensity. As a result of the aggregation
process, the signal of the Aβ1–42 monomer
progressively decreases until it almost disappears in 48 h, when incubated
alone (Ctrl sample, Figure 5). Conversely and in agreement with previous reports,75 myricetin was able to partially prevent monomer
inclusion into higher assemblies, slowing down the aggregation process.
Interestingly, CORM-3 was also able to interfere with amyloid aggregation
(Figure 5).

Figure 5 Time-dependent
inhibition of Aβ1–42 aggregation. IAβ1–42 monomers/IIs values after 30 min, 24 and 48 h
incubation. Aβ1–42 was incubated in the absence
(ctrl) and in the presence of myricetin (50 μM), CORM-3 (50
μM), and CORM-3 (250 μM).

It is noteworthy that the inhibitory activity of CORM-3 is
higher
at lower concentrations (1:1 molar ratio). This effect is further
elucidated in Figure 6, where the Aβ1–42 relative abundance in
the presence of CORM-3 at 5:1 and 1:1 ratio is shown in the time course
experiment. The Aβ1–42 in its native form
is not detectable after 24 h, when incubated in the presence of CORM-3
at higher concentration. In contrast, at 1:1 molar ratio, CORM-3 seems
to have an increased stabilizing effect on the Aβ1–42 peptide in its soluble form, as its signal is still detectable after
48 h. To make outcomes trustable, considering the intrinsic variability
of an aggregation process, data were collected in duplicate from two
independent experiments carried out with different batches of the
Aβ1–42 peptide. Future work could look to
exploit this chemical insight into biological settings to address
the physiological relevance of our observations. This could look to
exploit human pluripotent stem cells to maximize the translation aspects86 and additional in vivo use
of transgenic rodent models87 could look
to provide insight into CORMs effects on amyloidogenesis.

disappearance of Aβ1–42 monomer
in the presence of CORM-3. Relative abundance of native Aβ1–42 monomer measured after incubation with CORM-3 at
50 and 250 μM is reported ranging from 30 min to 48 h.

2.5 ThT Fluorescent
Analysis
The selectivity
of ThT binding for β-sheet structures suggests that this assay
can prove the ability of compounds to interfere with fibril formation.84 Aβ1–42 (50 μM)
samples were incubated at room temperature with different amounts
of CORM-3 to achieve final CORM-3/Aβ1–42 MRs
of 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0. After 48 h incubation, the samples were diluted
with glycine–NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 8.5) containing ThT (1.5
μM). Fluorescence emission intensity was monitored at 490 nm
(λexc = 446 nm) for 300 s. Fluorescence intensities
(IF) at 300 s were averaged after subtracting the background fluorescence
of 1.5 μM ThT solution and of the tested compound. Inhibition
of fibril formation is expressed as the percent decrease of fluorescence
in comparison with the Aβ1–42 control sample.
As shown in Figure 7, CORM-3 at 25 μM strongly inhibited the formation of Aβ1–42 fibrils to an extent similar to that by myricetin
but at a 2 times lower concentration. In agreement with the MS data
(Figure 5), the inhibitory
effect was more pronounced at the lowest CORM-3 concentration (lower
IF values) at which the extent of Aβ modification by CORM-3
is lower. This could be explained considering that different degrees
of modification could lead to different effects on amyloid aggregation.

fluorescence assay. Inhibition of fibrils formation obtained in the
presence of myricetin 50 μM or CORM-3 at different concentrations
is expressed as percentage of fluorescence signal recorded in the
presence and in the absence of the inhibitor.

2.6 CD Analysis
Misfolding of Aβ1–42 is widely recognized as the earliest step of amyloid
aggregation. In order to evaluate the inhibitory effect of CORM-3
on the formation of amyloid aggregates, the change of the Aβ1–42 secondary structure was monitored over 50 h by
CD spectroscopy74 (Figures 8 and 9). The CD spectra
of Aβ1–42 (Figure 8) show a clear transition from a prevalently
unordered conformation, characterized by two weak negative bands at
around 205 and 230 nm, to a β-strand structure, characterized
by a stronger negative band centered at 218 nm. Based on this observation,
the conformational change was monitored using the difference between
the CD signals at 205 nm (unordered) and 218 nm (β-strand) as
a function of time (Figure 9). Under the used experimental conditions, the misfolding
of Aβ1–42 is complete in 48 h, with the mid-transition
point occurring at 23.6 h.

times after sample preparation. (a) Aβ1–42 in the absence of CORM-3. (b) Aβ1–42 in
the presence of CORM-3 at 1:1 molar ratio. (c) Aβ1–42 in the presence of excess CORM-3 at 5:1 molar ratio.

5:1 molar ratio (diamonds, dotted line).

CORM-3 strongly interferes with the Aβ1–42 folding process. The CD spectra of the Aβ1–42/CORM-3 mixture at 1:1 molar ratio (Figure 8b) show a perturbation of the electronic
properties of the peptide due to the formation of stable adducts between
CORM-3 and a single histidine residue of Aβ1–42. The spectroscopic signature of β-strand structures, however,
was not observed throughout the considered time frame, indicating
that the conformational change was fully inhibited (Figure 9). On the other hand, the formation
of double and triple Aβ1–42/CORM-3 adducts
in the presence of a 5:1 molar excess of CORM-3 (Figure 8c) induced a conformational
change of Aβ1–42 toward a β-strand-like
arrangement which, nevertheless, did not evolve into an extensive
amount of misfolded peptide (Figure 9). This interpretation of CD data is supported by the
relative abundance of Aβ1–42/CORM-3 adducts
at different times, as shown by the ESI-MS analysis and by the ThT
fluorescence assay. Together, this suggests that the inhibition of
amyloid aggregation is highest when the interaction of CORM-3 with
Aβ1–42 involves a single histidine residue.
The results obtained via Aβ1–42 tryptic digestion
confirmed the hypothesis that His6 is the first to be involved by
CORM modification.

(0.22 μm) and nylon (0.20 μm) membrane filters (Millipore,
Carrigtwohill, Ireland B.V.) were employed to filter buffers and solutions.
CORM-3 and CORM-2 stock solutions were obtained by dissolving the
compounds in water or DMSO, respectively, in order to get the 100mM
starting concentration. Myricetin was solubilized in DMSO at a stock
concentration of 1 mg/mL. All compounds were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan,
Italy).

3.2 Aβ1–42 Preparation
Following the previously published procedure,73,74 1 mg of Aβ1–42 lyophilized powder was pretreated
overnight with 1400 μL of HFIP, portioned, and stored at −20
°C after solvent evaporation.

3.3 Characterization
of Aβ1–42-CORMs Adducts
An Aβ1–42 aliquot
(corresponding to 0.0368 μmol) was solubilized in 69.5 μL
of a freshly prepared mixture consisting of CH3CN/300 μM
Na2CO3/250 mM NaOH (48.3/48.3/3.4, v/v/v) to
obtain a 500 μM stock solution. CORM-2 100 mM stock solution
was prepared in DMSO, whereas the CORM-3 100 mM stock solution was
prepared in water. Stock solutions of the CORMs were kept at −20
°C before use.

To study the formation of stable adducts
between Aβ1–42 and CORM molecules, 3 μL
of the Aβ1–42 stock solution was diluted with
27 μL of 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.7 containing 11 mM NaCl,
in the absence and in the presence of CORM-2 or CORM-3 at 5.50, 13.7,
27.5, 55.0, 110, 275, and 550 μM concentrations to achieve final
CORM/Aβ1–42 MR equal to 0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10, respectively. Samples were incubated at 30
°C for 3 h and finally diluted 1:1 with water before the LC–MS
analysis. Experiments were performed in duplicate.

3.4 Inhibition Studies
3.4.1 MS-Based Assay
Aβ1–42 stock solution was diluted 1:10 with
10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.7
containing NaCl 11 mM, in the absence and in the presence of CORM-3
at 55.0 and 275 μM concentrations (to achieve the final CORM-3/Aβ1–42 MR equals to 0.0, 1.0, and 5.0, respectively) and
in the presence of 55.5 μM Myr (final Myr/Aβ1–42 MR 1: 1). Samples were incubated at room temperature (RT) and,
at selected times, 10 μL were diluted 1:1 with reserpine solution
(30 μM in water/MeOH, 50/50, v/v) employed as the internal standard.
The analysis was performed by the LC–MS analysis as reported
in Section 2.5. Two
independent experiments, each performed in duplicate, were carried
out using two different batches of Aβ1–42.

3.4.2 ThT-Based Fluorometric Assay
Aβ1–42 stock solution was diluted 1:10 with 10 mM phosphate
buffer pH 7.7 containing 11 mM NaCl, in the absence or presence of
CORM-3 at 27.5, 55.0, and 275 μM concentration to achieve the
final CORM-3/Aβ1–42 MR equal to 0.0, 0.5,
1.0, and 5.0, respectively. Samples were incubated at RT for 48 h
and finally diluted with the glycine–NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH
8.5) containing ThT (1.5 μM) to achieve the final volume of
2.0 mL. Fluorescence emission was monitored by a Jasco FP-6200 spectrofluorometer
(Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a 3 mL quartz cell. For each sample, the
fluorescence emission signal was monitored at 490 nm (λex = 446 nm) with excitation and emission slits of 2 nm bandwidth.
A time scan was performed, and the fluorescence intensity values at
the plateau (300 s) were averaged after subtracting the background
fluorescence from 1.5 μM ThT.

3.4.3 LC–MS
Analysis
LC–MS
analyses were performed by an Agilent 1200 Series (Walbronn, Germany)
coupled with an ESI-Q-ToF mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray
ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Flow injection analyses were
performed by employing water/acetonitrile/FA (70/30/0.1; v/v/v) as
the mobile phase at the flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. The injection volume
was 5 μL. The capillary voltage was set at 3000 V, the cone
voltage was 40 V, the capillary temperature was 100 °C, while
the desolvation temperature was 300 °C. Mass spectra were recorded
in total ion current (TIC), within 1000 and 2000 m/z, in positive polarity. The Aβ1–42 baseline-subtracted spectrum (m/z 1100–1700) was deconvoluted onto a true mass scale using
the maximum entropy (MaxEnt1)-based software supplied with MassLynx
software. The output parameters were mass range: 4100–5200
Da and resolution: 2 Da/channel. The uniform Gaussian model was used,
with 0.63 Da width at half height. The Aβ1–42 (alone or forming a complex with CORMs) relative abundance was calculated
by dividing the corresponding form intensity by the sum of all forms
intensities and multiplying them by 100. Data were analyzed by Excel.

3.4.4 LC-ESI-MS/MS Analysis
A 3 μL
aliquot of Aβ1–42 stock solution (500 μM)
was diluted ten folds with 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.7 containing
11 mM NaCl, in the absence and in the presence of CORM-2 or CORM-3
to achieve final CORM/Aβ1–42 MR equal to 5.0
and 10. Samples were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C, then 1 μL
of trypsin (1 μg/μL; Sigma T1426) was added and samples
were incubated overnight at 37 °C to allow peptide digestion.
Aβ1–42 tryptic digest (10 μL), corresponding
to 485 pmol, was analyzed by using an Agilent 1100 Series system (Walbronn,
Germany). Analyses were performed on a C18 column (Aeris peptide XB-C18;
150 × 2.1 mm; 3.5 μm; Phenomenex). Mobile phases A [water/acetonitrile/FA
(99/1/0.1, v/v/v)] and B [water/acetonitrile/FA (1/99/0.1, v/v/v)]
were used to develop a gradient. The solvent gradient was set as follows:
A–B from (98:8, v/v) to (40:60, v/v) in 20 min; (40:60, v/v)
for 2 min. The column was equilibrated with the mobile phase composition
of the starting conditions for 10 min before the next injection. MS
analysis was performed on the Q-ToF Micro hybrid analyzer (Micromass,
Manchester, UK) with a Z-spray ion source. The ESI-Q-ToF source temperature
was set at 100 °C, the capillary voltage at 3.0 kV, and the cone
voltage at 35 V. Peptide ions within a m/z 400–1700 survey scan mass range were analyzed for
subsequent fragmentation. 2+, 3+, and 4+ charged ions exceeding a threshold abundance (TIC value:
10 counts/s) were selected for MS/MS analyses. From a single survey
scan, 4 ions were selected for subsequent fragmentation. Scan returns
to mass survey mode when the ion intensity falls below 5 counts/s
or after 8 s. Scan time was 1 s for the parent ion and 1 s for the
MS/MS ions. The collision energy was selected using charge state recognition.

3.4.5 CD Analysis
CD measurements were
carried out at 25 °C in the 260–200 nm spectral range
on a Jasco (Tokyo, Japan) J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a
PTC-423S Peltier-type temperature control system, using QS quartz
cells (Hellma Italia, Milan, Italy) with a 0.1 cm path length, a 2
nm spectral bandwidth, a 0.5 nm data interval, a 20 nm min–1 scanning speed, and a 2 s data integration time. Aβ1–42 samples (50 μM, 200 μL final volume), either in the
absence or in the presence of CORM-3 at both 1 and 5 MR, were prepared
as previously described. The CD spectra of all samples were measured
at different times after preparation (up to 52 h) to follow the time
evolution of the secondary structure of Aβ1–42 and evaluate the effect of CORM-3 on the misfolding process. Baseline
correction was performed by subtracting the spectral contribution
of phosphate buffer (8.7 mM) containing NaCl (10 mM), Na2CO3 (14.5 mM), NaOH (0.85 mM), and acetonitrile (8.2%,
v/v); CORM-3 was not included in the blank solution, as it shows no
CD signal in the spectral range considered in the analysis. Solvent-corrected
CD spectra were then converted to molar units per residue (Δεres, M–1 cm–1) and plotted
using the Bezier smoothing algorithm provided by the Gnuplot software
(version 5.2.2, http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net). The conformational change of Aβ1–42 was
monitored by plotting the difference between the unsmoothed CD signals
at 205 and 218 nm (Δεres,205 – Δεres,218) as a function of time.

4 Conclusions
The applied multi-methodological approach provides
a detailed analysis
of the in vitro Aβ1–42 kinetics by detailing
the formation of diverse assembly species. Combination of ThT assay,
ESI-MS analysis, and CD studies grant reliable information on the
overall fibrilization process as well as the identification of aggregation
inhibitors and the nature of this inhibition (CD or ESI-MS).

Specifically, the ESI-MS data demonstrated that CORM-3 and CORM-2
directly interact with Aβ1–42, producing stable
soluble adducts. This likely occurs through histidine modification
via the addition of the Ru(CO)2 moiety. Indeed, the results
obtained by the tryptic digestion experiment confirmed the hypothesis
that His6 is the first His residue to be involved in Aβ modification
by studied CORMs.

By varying the molar ratio, incubation
time and type of CORM, the
extent of Aβ1–42 modification changed. CORM-2,
possessing two Ru atoms per molecule, was effective in modifying Aβ1–42 at a lower molar ratio than CORM-3. The higher
reactivity highlighted for CORM-2 is certainly due to the different
stoichiometry of the beta amyloid: metal reaction. For CORM-2, this
rate is twice that for CORM-3. Moreover, Kumar and co-workers reported
a much higher binding affinity of the binuclear complex, [(bpy)2Ru2+ (dpp)Pt2+Cl2]2+ instead of the mononuclear [(dpp)Pt2+Cl2]
toward Aβ.51 The results revealed
the mono histidine-modified Aβ1–42 to be more
soluble and less prone to aggregate than the double- or triple-modified
Aβ1–42, implying that the higher stabilizing
effect is reached at lower Aβ1–42/CORM-3 molar
ratio. CD studies highlighted that, in the mono-modified form, the
β-strand conformational change is fully inhibited. On the other
hand, the formation of double and triple Aβ1–42/CORM-3 adducts in the presence of a 1:5 molar excess of CORM-3 induces
a conformational change of Aβ1–42 toward a
β-strand-like arrangement which, nevertheless, does not evolve
into an extensive misfolding of the peptide. This interpretation of
CD data is supported by the relative abundance of Aβ1–42/CORM-3 adducts at different times, as observed by ESI-MS analysis,
and by a ThT fluorescence assay, suggesting that the inhibition of
amyloid aggregation is the highest when the interaction of CORM-3
with Aβ1–42 involves a single histidine residue.

Therefore, a novel mechanism of action of the CORMs was determined
with reference to their capacity to create some stable adducts with
Aβ1–42 amino acidic chain.

CORM-3 emerged
as a promising inhibitory agent toward Aβ1–42 aggregation. MS and ThT studies also supported
the identification of the optimal CORM-3/Aβ1–42 ratio for the best inhibitory effect.

This study contributes
to the evaluation of the spectrum of activities
exerted by CORM-3. In terms of therapeutic potential, the highlighted
antiaggregating properties nicely complement the already known neuroprotective
and anti-inflammatory properties of CORM-3.25,26,88,89 Therefore,
we can use these findings as a further potential mechanism explaining
the CORMs-mediated reduction of Aβ toxicity previously reported in vitro and additionally in vivo. Furthermore,
the fact that CORM-3 does not increase CO levels in vivo(90) and that the CO trapped by hemoglobin
in therapeutic conditions is below the toxicity threshold (in humans,
this threshold is close to 10% COHb)91 make
these molecules appealing for further developments.

Taken together,
the outcomes of this study open up new avenues
to explore the potential of CORMs to inhibit aggregation of other
disease-related peptides, such as alpha synuclein.92
