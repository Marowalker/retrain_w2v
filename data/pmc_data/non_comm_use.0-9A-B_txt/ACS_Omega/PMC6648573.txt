The properties of
nanostructured plant-derived porous silicon (pSi)
microparticles as potential candidates to increase the bioavailability
of plant extracts possessing anti-inflammatory activity are described
in this work. pSi drug carriers were fabricated using an eco-friendly
route from the silicon accumulator plant bamboo (tabasheer) powder
by magnesiothermic reduction of plant-derived silica and loaded with
ethanolic extracts of Equisetum arvense, another silicon accumulator plant rich in polyphenolic compounds.
The anti-inflammatory properties of the active therapeutics present
in this extract were measured by sensitive luciferase reporter assays;
this active extract was subsequently loaded and released from the
pSi matrix, with a clear inhibition of the activity of the inflammatory
signaling protein NF-κB over a period of hours in a sustained
manner. Our results showed that after loading the extracts of E. arvense into pSi microparticles derived from tabasheer,
enhanced anti-inflammatory activity was observed owing to enhanced
solubility of the extract.

Introduction
Chronic inflammation
is a condition implicated in several diseases
including cancer,1 Alzheimer’s disease,2 and rheumatoid arthritis.3 Prolonged use of anti-inflammatory drugs is necessary in these cases
to reduce associated inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) and small biological molecules are a promising approach
to treat this condition; however, long-term usage of NSAIDs are associated
with serious side effects, thereby affecting the quality of life.4 Other strategies involving the use of small biological
drug molecules (e.g. chimeric monoclonal antibodies) have resulted
in decreased therapeutic activity over time owing to drug resistance.5

One alternative for treating chronic inflammation
is the use of
plant extracts rich in polyphenolic compounds.6 Some of the well-known polyphenols that have shown anti-inflammatory
activity include curcumin,7 epigallocatechin
gallate,8 and quercetin.9 Synergistic anticancer activity of polyphenolic compounds
has been observed in many cases; curcumin and catechin have shown
high growth inhibition of human colon adenocarcinoma cells and use
of quercetin and doxorubicin have demonstrated greater inhibition
of cancer cells that are resistant to doxorubicin.10,11 However, two of the major problems associated with the use of such
compounds are their low bioavailability and relatively short half-life.8−13 Because of this poor bioavailability, high oral doses or repeated
dosing is often needed to reach an effective plasma concentration.

To address these challenges with polyphenolic-containing extracts,
and to employ a nano/microscale drug carrier that is fabricated by
a “green” route that avoids relatively toxic reagents,
we have encapsulated ethanolic extracts of Equisetum
arvense (horsetail, itself a Si accumulator plant)
into porous silicon (pSi) microparticles to increase their bioavailability.
Such extracts were loaded into nanostructured pSi particles prepared
by our previously optimized eco-friendly fabrication route from silicon
accumulator plants.14−16 Nanostructured pSi, typically prepared by anodization
techniques, is an established drug delivery vehicle,17,18 with broadly tunable porosities,19 surface
functionalities,20 and resorptivity in
vitro/in vivo.21−23 Elemental pSi is utilized here rather than totally
oxidized porous silica (SiO2) platforms such as diatoms,24,25 as pSi provides a relatively more tunable resorptive profile as
well as greater photostability of the active therapeutic within the
pores.16 In this study, the potential utility
of pSi microparticles derived from tabasheer (Concretio
silicea bambusae) loaded with ethanolic leaf extracts
of E. arvense as a therapeutic agent
was evaluated for anti-inflammatory properties. We have optimized
entrapment techniques to efficiently load these E.
arvense extracts into pSi particles in order to subsequently
release anti-inflammatory components in a sustained fashion. Specifically,
we have investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of ethanolic extracts
of E. arvense released from pSi microparticles
by studying their effect on the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-mediated
nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
activation.

NF-κB is a transcription factor regulating
various cellular
responses that are involved in a variety of cellular functions such
as cell proliferation, apoptosis, as well as immune responses to infection
and inflammation.26 NF-κB molecules
exist in most of the cells in an inactive form complexed with the
inhibitory protein, IκB. In response to a stimulus (e.g. cytokines-IL-2
and TNF, viral infection, bacterial endotoxins, UV radiation) IκB
kinase (IKK) enzyme phosphorylates IκB, leading to subsequent
ubiquitination of IκB followed by proteasomal degradation. The
removal of IκB reveals a nuclear localization sequence on NF-κB,
which can now undergo nuclear translocation. NF-κB then attaches
to specific binding sequences on the DNA and activates the transcription
and secretion of a variety of proteins responsible for triggering
inflammation.26

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Plant-Derived pSi
pSi particles
were prepared by magnesiothermic reduction of silica extracted from
tabasheer powder, according to a previously reported procedure.14−16 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1a) of a typical reaction product shows a
highly porous nanoscale morphology for these particles; the average
pSi particle size estimated by TEM analysis is 1300 ± 400 nm
(Figure S1); high-resolution TEM imaging
(Figure 1b) shows a
lattice spacing of 0.310 nm associated with the (111) index of cubic
Si. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) associated with this image (inset)
is consistent with a polycrystalline orientation of the Si in this
matrix.

(b) high-resolution TEM image shows the (111) planes of cubic Si;
(c) FFT of the associated silicon nanocrystalline region (scale bar

As noted in previous studies,
pSi particles derived by such a route
using this silicious-rich substance derived from the nodal joints
of bamboo have a nanostructured morphology that is best described
as mesoporous (dominant pore sizes in the range of 2–50 nm).
This material is composed of Si nanostructures embedded in a rough
oxide-rich matrix; surface areas on the order of 150 m2 per gram are typically obtained.

Testing the Anti-Inflammatory
Activity of E.
arvense Extract
Prior to loading into the
porous Si drug carrier, the anti-inflammatory activity of an extract
of E. arvense (harvested from a natural
source in Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) was examined by monitoring
its ability to inhibit TNFα-mediated activation of the NF-κB
gene promoter with a luciferase assay. Scheme 1 illustrates a schematic representation of
the luciferase assay.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Luciferase
Assay
HEK 293 cells were treated
with an ethanolic extract of E. arvense for 1 h followed by stimulation with 10
ng/mL of TNFα. As a positive control for inhibition, cells were
transfected with IκBΔN, a dominant negative inhibitor
of NF-κB, which has the phosphorylation sites mutated, rendering
it unable to be ubiquitinated and degraded. Cells treated with extracts
at concentrations of 200 μg/mL (w/v) showed significant decreases
in luciferase production (concomitant with an inhibition of NF-κB-mediated
gene expression), demonstrating that the extract inhibited the TNFα-induced
activation of NF-κB. The ability of this extract to inhibit
NF-κB gene expression was compared to a commercially available
anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac sodium; in our experiments, at
similar concentrations, the extract shows a comparable level of inhibition
relative to diclofenac sodium (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Inhibition of NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression
by E. arvense extract, diclofenac (known
anti-inflammatory
drug), and IκBΔN (positive control). Cells were treated
with 10 ng/mL of TNFα to induce NF-κB gene activation.
The presence and absence of TNF and extract are denoted by symbols
(+) and (−), respectively.

Characterization of E. arvense Extract-Loaded
pSi
pSi microparticles were subsequently
impregnated with an E. arvense ethanol
leaf extract by a solution loading method. A mixture of solvents,
ethanol, water, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were used in the ratio
of 2:2:1 by volume. DMSO was used as a co-solvent to enhance the concentration
of extract in the solution. Loading capacity was evaluated by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and physical state of the extract after loading into
pSi was evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC).

Thermogravimetric Analysis
The extract
was loaded into
pSi with a theoretical loading of ∼30% by weight. TGA was used
to analyze the loading capacity of the extract into pSi microparticles.
Mass loss profile was observed between 25 and 350 °C, which may
include evaporation of the solvent mixture along with partial removal
of the crude extract components (Figure S2). The observed mass loss, 15.0 ± 2.0%, is assumed (within this
temperature range) to underestimate the amount of loaded extract owing
to incomplete removal of all the components of the extract.

Differential
Scanning Calorimetry
Major phenolic constituents
of the E. arvense extract are kaempferol
and quercetin.27 An overlay of DSC thermograms
is shown in the Supporting Information Figure S3 for an E. arvense extract
and extract-loaded pSi. The DSC trace of the E. arvense extract shows two endothermic events in the range of 50–150
and 200–350 °C. Melting within 50–150 °C can
be attributed to evaporation of water, co-solvent, or residual extract
components with low melting points. The second melting peak in the
DSC trace within the range of 200–350 °C is likely a consequence
of the melting of major phenolic constituents kaempferol and quercetin,
with melting points of 276 and 316 °C, respectively. Such values
fall within the melting range (200–350 °C) of this extract.
From these observations, one can infer that these two compounds are
indeed present in the E. arvense ethanol
extract. After loading the extract into pSi, the DSC trace shows a
clear shift in the melting peak to a lower range, consistent with
a reduction in crystallite size of the components in the extract as
a consequence of pore confinement.28,29

XRD Analysis
Figure 3 shows an
overlay of XRD diffractograms obtained for
pSi microparticles, an E. arvense dried
extract, and an E. arvense extract
loaded into pSi derived from tabasheer. The diffraction pattern of
the E. arvense extract alone with the
most intense peaks at 26°, 41°, 51°, and 67° indicates
the presence of highly crystalline phases in such a mixture. Assuming
that the above loaded concentration of extract in the pSi particles
is within the detection limit of the XRD, the absence of these peaks
after loading into pSi microparticles suggests that some nanostructuring
of the extract components takes place upon its loading into the porous
Si matrix.30

Figure 3 XRD analysis of E. arvense dry extract,
before and after loading into pSi microparticles.

In Vitro Release of Anti-Inflammatory Extract
As pointed
out above, E. arvense is rich in polyphenolic
compounds, having poor solubility in aqueous buffered media.31 Similar observations were qualitatively noted
here while loading an E. arvense extract
into pSi particles. When the E. arvense extract was initially dispersed in water, the addition of organic
solvents (ethanol and DMSO) greatly enhanced the solubility of the
extract. In vitro release of the anti-inflammatory extract was monitored
by a luciferase assay. Figure 4 shows the release profile of bulk soluble extract and extract
loaded into pSi. After a short duration (3.5 min), at any given time
point the amount of the soluble extract released from pSi is significantly
higher than the bulk extract itself. There is no notable difference
(<5%) between the amount of soluble extract released from pSi and
just the extract itself at time points of 0.5 and 1.5 min. This is
confirmed by a statistical analysis of these two categories over the
timescale of the release experiment [analysis of variance (ANOVA)];
only for the initial time point of 0.5 min are the two categories
indistinguishable (P = 0.1); for the remaining release
points, the categories are clearly statistically different [P values ranging from 0.03 (1.5 min) to 0.001 (143.5 min)].
This similarity within the first 2 min of release can be attributed
to surface bound crystalline extract present outside the pSi microparticles
that has similar solubility profiles as that of the bulk crystalline
extract. Any surface-bound fraction present on pSi particles is either
due to pore overfilling or a recrystallized portion of the extract
that is present within the pores of Si microparticles. A marked difference
(>10%) in the amount of soluble extract released from pSi and the
extract was observed at later points of time from 3.5 to 143.5 min.
This suggests that the gradual release of the pore-confined extract
components in nanostructured form (as noted from the above DSC and
XRD measurements) enhanced the solubility of the extract. At the end
of 143.5 min, the cumulative release of the soluble extract from pSi
is twofold higher than the extract alone.

Figure 4 In vitro release of the
anti-inflammatory components from pSi loaded
with E. arvense extract. Statistical
differences between the two categories beyond 0.5 min are confirmed
by ANOVA analyses (P < 0.05).

Anti-Inflammatory Activity of the Released E.
arvense Extract
We also quantified the anti-inflammatory
activity of the released extract to explore the possible difference
between the activity of the extract and extract loaded into pSi. As
described in the Experimental Section, the
amount of extract released at a given time point was added to the
HEK 293 cells, and the luciferase gene expression was measured using
a luminometer. The limitation of the assay is that only 100 μL
of the extract released into the sterile water at a given time point
is able to be added to the cells to minimize the dilution of growth
medium (needed for healthy cell growth). The minimum dose required
(E. arvense) to show anti-inflammatory
activity by this assay is 40 μg/mL. This means that every 100
μL of the extract should contain at least 400 μg of the
extract to show any observable anti-inflammatory activity. Owing to
the limitations of the assay protocol all the test samples collected
at each time point are spiked with a known concentration of the extract
to clearly visualize the enhanced anti-inflammatory activity of the
extract after loading into pSi. Figure 5 shows the levels of luciferase activity in the presence
of extract released from pSi and bulk extract alone. We used 1% DMSO-treated
HEK 293 cells as our control. Anti-inflammatory compounds should ideally
decrease the luciferase expression by blocking NF-KB activation. We
observed reduced luciferase gene expression compared to the control
(1% DMSO), thereby showing the anti-inflammatory nature of the E. arvense extract. Beyond the 8.5 min release point,
enhanced anti-inflammatory activity was observed in the case of extract
loaded into pSi compared to just the extract itself. For the data
shown in Figure 5,
the expression levels are statistically comparable from the 0.5 to
8.5 min window (P ≈ 0.1), but are different
at 23.5 min release and beyond (P < 0.001). A
notable difference (0.5 fold) in the anti-inflammatory activity was
observed at the 143.5 min release point, owing to the likely enhanced
solubility of the extract after loading into pSi.

Figure 5 Anti-inflammatory activity
of the E. arvense extract and extract-loaded
pSi powders. All samples were spiked
with (50 μg/mL) of E. arvense extract. Statistical differences between the two categories beyond
8.5 min are confirmed by ANOVA analyses (P < 0.05).

Overall, in these experiments
we have demonstrated that pSi microparticles
derived from tabasheer can serve as effective controlled release carriers
to entrap and release anti-inflammatory polyphenolic components with
otherwise poor aqueous solubility. Combined results from XRD and DSC
measurements showed that E. arvense actives can be entrapped into pSi in a more soluble form (presumably
owing to nanostructuring of the extract components). This is a strikingly
similar phenomenon to that observed previously in the case of pSi
loaded with hydrophobic antibacterial compounds such as triclosan.32−34 These similarities indicate that mesoporous morphologies of plant-derived
pSi microparticles are capable of loading either a single active component
or a complex multicomponent mixture (as in this case) in a more soluble
form, thereby ideally enhancing its bioavailability. Expanding the
number of possible examples utilizing this ability of porous Si to
improve this parameter continues.

Experimental Section
Instrumentation
TGA was performed using a Seiko SII
model SSC/5200 TGA at a heating rate of 10 °C/min (up to 400
°C) under nitrogen. DSC analysis was done using a DSC 2 system
(Mettler Toledo). Duplicate measurements were made using TGA and DSC.
A given sample was placed into a Al pan with a hole on top and heated
from 25 to 400 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min, under nitrogen
flush. XRD was carried out using a Phillips 3100 X-ray powder diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation operating at 35 kV. Luciferase gene expression
was measured by a Berthold SIRIUS II luminometer. Field emission SEM
and energy dispersive X-ray analysis was conducted with a JEOL JSM-7100F
operating at 15 kV. TEM imaging was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100.

Soxhlet Extraction of E. arvense Leaves
E. arvense leaves
and stems were harvested from a natural source in Malvern, Worcestershire,
UK in fall 2016. The obtained leaves were shade-dried for two days.
Ground powder (6 g) was extracted with 50% ethanol (100 mL) at a temperature
of 120 °C in a Soxhlet extractor. After 6 h, the extract was
concentrated through the use of rotary evaporator, and the dry extracts
were stored at 4 °C for further analysis.

Loading of E. arvense Leaf Extract
into pSi
Leaf extract was loaded into tabasheer-derived pSi
particles using a solution loading method. Dried extract powder (3.4
mg) was dissolved in a solvent mixture of ethanol, water, and DMSO
(2:2:1 by volume). Extract solution (150 μL) was added to the
pSi particles (10.2 mg). The mixture was then dried under vacuum overnight.

Cell Lines and Culture
The HEK 293 (human embryonic
kidney fibroblast) cell line was used for all experiments. The cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin–streptomycin
(88 U/mL penicillin and 88 μg/mL streptomycin), l-glutamine
(0.88 mM), and 1/100 minimum essential medium non-essential amino
acids (Sigma #M7145). The cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 95% air.

Luciferase Assay
A luciferase activity assay was used
to measure the luciferase gene expression triggered by TNFα-induced
activation of NF-κB. HEK 293 cells were treated with the anti-inflammatory
extract released from the pSi particles. All the samples were run
in triplicate. HEK 293 cells were plated in 24-well plates with a
cell density of 50 000/well. After 24 h, cells were transfected (step
1) with two plasmids RLCMV-LUC (5 ng/mL Renilla sp.); PRDII-LUC (10 ng/mL firefly) using a commercial transfecting
agent LyoVec (Invitrogen). PRDII-LUC plasmid has an NF-κB binding
site and luciferase reporter (LUC) gene. RLCMV-LUC (5 ng/mL; Renilla sp.) with a constitutively active human cytomegalovirus
immediate early promoter driving luciferase reporter gene is used
as an internal control, so that by normalizing the activity, the experimental
variability (e.g. cell viability or transfection efficiency) will
be minimized. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were treated with
different concentrations of anti-inflammatory extract (100 μL)
prepared in 1% DMSO (step 2); 1 h later the cells were stimulated
with 10 ng/mL of TNFα and 5 h later, the cells were harvested
and lysed with passive lysis buffer (100 μL/well, Promega, Dual-Luciferase
assay kit). The luciferase assays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s assay protocol, and luminescence produced by
luciferase gene expression was measured by a luminometer (step 3).

Standard Curve for the E. arvense Extract
(Anti-Inflammatory Activity)
A stock solution was
prepared by dissolving 9 mg of E. arvense extract in 1 mL of 2% DMSO. Standard solutions of the extract were
added to the wells to give final concentrations of extract per well
ranging from 40 to 300 μg/mL. The final concentration of DMSO
in each well is 1%. The luminescence observed from the expression
of luciferase is recorded by a luminometer. Supporting Information Figure S4 shows the standard curve with a concentration
of the extract plotted against the luciferase expression.

In Vitro Release
of E. arvense Extract from pSi Microparticles
In vitro release of the E. arvense extract from the pSi particles was monitored
by a luciferase assay for the release of anti-inflammatory compounds.
All the samples were run in triplicates. pSi microparticles loaded
with the E. arvense extract (5 mg)
as well as samples of solid E. arvense extract itself (1.5 mg) were placed in two different vials with
1 mL of sterilized water and agitated at 30 rpm. At the end of a given
time point, the vials were centrifuged for 2 min at 500 rpm, the supernatant
was removed and replenished with 1 mL of fresh sterilized water. The
supernatant containing the soluble extract (100 μL) was added
to the 24-well plate seeded with a cell density of 5000 cells/well.
The amount of anti-inflammatory compounds released from pSi and the
extract itself at a chosen time period is below the detection limit
of the luciferase assay. A standard addition method was used to bring
the concentration levels within the range of the standard curve. All
the wells are treated with a known concentration of the extract (50
μg/mL). The actual amount of soluble extract released at a given
time point was quantified in reference to a standard curve developed
by the luciferase assay.
