1H-1,2,3-Triazole tethered
imidazole–isatin and imidazole–isatin–thiosemicarbazone
conjugates were synthesized and evaluated against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cell lines. Antiproliferative activities of the synthesized conjugates
revealed an optimum combination of longer alkyl chain length as spacer
and a halogen-substituent on the isatin ring as a pre-requisite for
good activity. The compound 6g with an optimum combination
of chloro-substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring and a butyl chain
length proved to be most active and noncytotoxic with IC50s of 54.25 and 26.12 μM against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines,
respectively.

Introduction
Cancer is responsible
for approximately 8.2 million deaths and
remains as the most difficult disease to treat worldwide.1 Rapidly dividing cells such as breast, skin,
and uterine cells are at higher risk of mutations compared with cells
which do not divide and thus are more prone to develop cancer. Breast
cancer (BC) is one of the most frequently occurring cancers leading
to significant morbidity and mortality among women.2 An insight into cancer facts and figures for the year 2016–2017
revealed an estimated number of deaths of 41 070 through BC
among women and men in US.3 The situation
is worse in India where BC accounts 25–32% of all cancer cases.
According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) survey report
2016, an estimated new number of cancer patients were 14.5 million
in 2016 which will likely to reach around 17.3 million by 2020.4

One of the significant approaches for the
treatment of BC comprises the selectively inhibiting the binding of
estrogen with estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and resulted
in the identification of selective estrogen modulators, SERMs. Estrogen
has been reported to play a vital role in the growth and development
of mammary glands. Interaction of estrogen with estrogen receptors
(ERα and ERβ) stimulates the proliferation of mammary
cells. MCF-7 cells, being ERα dependent, are found to be sensitive
to SERMs while MDA-MB-231 cells which are ER-β dependent are
characterized by the absence of immune-histochemical expression of
estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors.5−8 Triarylethylenes
derivatives like raloxifene, tamoxifen (TAM), and toremifene are approved
SERMs by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with significant anti-BC
profile.9 TAM, an antagonist, is the first-line
drug employed for the treatment of BC. However, only 70% of ERα
cases respond to TAM while 30–40% patients with adjuvant TAM
therapy eventually relapse.10−12 Furthermore, TAM has an adverse
effect on endometrium causing endometrial
cancer while raloxifene causes hot flashes, insomnia, dizziness, and
melancholy.13

Imidazole and its derivatives
are of great interest in medicinal chemistry because of their versatile
pharmacological properties such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-tuberculosis,
and anticancer activities.14−17 Natural imidazolium halides for
example, lepidiline A and lepidiline B, are isolated from the roots
of Lepidiummeyenii and showed potent
cytotoxic activity against the human cancer cell lines.18 Further studies on molecular mechanism confirmed
that the imidazolium salt hybrids can induce G1 phase cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in tumor cells.19

Another
important scaffold isatin possess a wide variety of activities such
as anticancer, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, antifungal, anti-HIV,
and anti-inflammatory properties.20−25 BIBF1120 II, an isatin-based
triple angio-kinase inhibitor for the diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung
cancer, is in phase III clinical trials.26 Sunitinib III (Sutent) is another isatin based scaffold approved
recently by FDA for treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors and advanced
renal cell carcinoma.27

A recent
report from our laboratory has shown the synthesis and antiproliferative
evaluation of a series of 1H-1,2,3-triazole linked
ospemifene–isatin conjugates against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell
lines.28 In continuation,29 the present work comprises the synthesis, antiproliferative
evaluation, and docking studies of 1H-1,2,3-triazole
tethered imidazole–isatin and imidazole–isatin–thiosemicarbazone
conjugates against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. The promising
scaffolds were also evaluated to inspect their cytotoxicity against
normal HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cell line.

Result and Discussion
Synthetic methodology
involved sodium hydride-promoted N-alkylation of 1a–c and subsequent treatment with sodium azide afforded the N-alkylazido-isatins 3a–c (Scheme 1). Another precursor
viz. 2-methyl-5-nitro-1-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)-1H-imidazole 5 was prepared via K2CO3-promoted N-propargylation
of 4 in anhyd DMF.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Substituted N-Alkyl-azido-isatins
The target 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole–isatin
conjugates 6a–l were obtained via Cu-promoted
1,3-cycloaddition reaction between appropriate precursors’ 5 and 3 as depicted in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 2-Methyl-5-nitroimidazole–Isatin
Conjugates and
2-Methyl-5-nitroimidazole–Isatin–Thiosemicarbazones
The synthesized conjugates 6a–l were further reacted with thiosemicarbazide in
refluxing ethanol to yield the corresponding 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole–isatin–thiosemicarbazones 7a–l. The structure assigned to the synthesized conjugates
was based on spectral data and analytical evidence. Compound 6b, for example,
characterized as 1-(3-(4-((2-methyl-5nitro-1H-imidazole-1-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)propyl)indoline-2,3-dione showed a
molecular ion peak at m/z 396.1389
[M + H]+ in its high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS). The
salient features of its proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum encompassed the appearance of distinguishing peaks
at δ 2.17, 3.72, 4.46, and 5.34 conforming to different methylenes
and a singlet at δ 2.39 corresponding to methyl at C-2 position
of the imidazole ring. Its carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectrum, apart from requisite number of carbons,
exhibited characteristic absorptions corresponding to isatin carbonyls
at δ 158.7 and 183.7, further corroborating the assigned structure.

The synthesized library of 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole–isatin
and 2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole–isatin–thiosemicarbazones
were assessed for their antiproliferative profile against MCF-7 (ERα)
and MDA-MB-231 (ERβ) human BC cell lines using an MTT assay.
The growth inhibitions of synthesized compounds against MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells at variable concentrations have been summarized in Figure 1 using plumbagin
as the positive control. IC50 value, which is the concentration
required to inhibit 50% of cell viability by the test compounds, has
been summarized in Table 1.

cells at selected concentrations of test compounds 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, 6g, 6h, 6i, 6j, 6l, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 6k, 7i, and 7k. Plumbagin (40 μM) was used as a positive control. Data are
mean ± standard deviation S.D. (n = 3) from
raw data, where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 significant difference
to untreated control.

Table 1 IC50 Values of Synthesized
Conjugates against
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cell Lines along with % Yield
As evident, the activities of synthesized
conjugates
were found to depend upon the nature of substituent at C-5 position
of isatin ring, the alkyl chain length introduced as spacer, and the
nature of functionality at C-2 position of isatin ring. Analyzing
structure–activity relationship (SAR) among conjugates 6a–d (R=H); revealed that the compounds were
more active against MCF-7 than MDA-MB-231 cells at higher concentrations.
Among conjugates 6e–h (R=Cl); the activity
tends to increase with the increase in chain length, with compounds
being more cytotoxic against MDA-MB-231 than MCF-7 cell lines. The
conjugate 6g (R=Cl, n = 3); exhibited
comparable IC50 value to that of standard drug TAM against
MCF-7 while ∼3 times more activity has been observed against
MDA-MB-231 cell line. Similarly, 6h (R=Cl, n = 4) was found to be ∼2 times more potent in MCF-7
and ∼5 times in MDA-MB-231 compared with TAM (Figure 1).

Similar effects were
observed by replacing chloro with fluoro at C-5 position of isatin
ring. The conjugate 6k (n = 3) and 7l (n = 4) showed comparable activities to
TAM against both cell lines (Figure 2). The carbonyl group at C-3 position of isatin ring
was converted to the corresponding thiosemicarbazone with a view of
enhancing their cytotoxic activities as evidenced by literary rationale.30 The resulting isatin–nitroimidazole–thiosemicarbazones
were then evaluated against both cell lines viz. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231.
Interestingly, the introduction of thiosemicarbazone functionality
improved the activity profiles as evident by 7d which
exhibited an IC50 value of ∼70 μM against
both cell lines while the parent compounds 6a–d were inactive (Figure 1).

Figure 2 Representative graph
showing percentage growth
inhibition of HEK-293 cells at selected concentrations of test compounds 6g, 6h, 6l, and 7d.
Plumbagin (40 μM) was used as a positive control. Data are mean
± standard deviation S.D. (n = 3) from raw data,
where *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01
and ***p < 0.001 significant difference to untreated
control.

Furthermore, Cl-substituted-isatin–imidazole–thiosemicarbazones
were found to be more active against MDA-MB-231 cells than in ER +
MCF-7 cells but did not cause 50% growth inhibition in either of the
cell line (Figure 1). Especially compounds 7e–7g (Figure 1) inhibited growth of more
than 30% of cells at low concentrations (1, 5 and 10 μM), whereas
less than 50% cell death was observed in MCF-7 cells even at higher
concentrations. The compounds, 7b–7d showed similar
patterns indicating that these compounds are not necessarily reliant
on the presence of the ER. A further trend has also been observed
where 50 μM concentrations proved to be most effective in inhibiting
cell growth, which could be attributed to the development of resistance
at higher concentrations.

Because 6g, 6h, 6l, and 7d showed significant growth
inhibition in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, we further tested them
on a normal cell line HEK-293 to confirm their potential as anticancer
agents. The percentage growth inhibition of the promising compounds
along with their IC50 values is provided in Figure 2 and Table 2, respectively. As evident, except for 6h, the other three tested compounds exhibited IC50 values greater than 100 μM, indicative of the fact this molecular
framework holds plausible promise for the design of new antiproliferative
agents against BC.

Molecular Docking
Studies
Molecular docking of the active ligands in the binding
site of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was performed to determine
the crucial binding interactions responsible for the inhibitory effect
observed. IGF-1 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase which plays a significant
role in the development and function of many tissues, including the
mammary gland. It is implicated in malignant BC as it is over-expressed
in tumors. It is responsible for mediating cell-proliferation and
providing protection against cell apoptosis. The signaling of the
IGF pathway has been noted to directly affect the propensity for invasion
and metastasis by influencing tumor cell motility and adhesion.31

The native ligand in the crystal structure
of IGF-1 (PDB ID: 1JQH) was an adenylyl imidodiphosphate which inhibited the receptor by
binding to the kinase domain. The binding interaction profile of the
ligand–protein complex largely comprised hydrogen bonds with
residues Ser26, Lys22, Glu97, Met99, and Lys50, as well as the formation
of a water bridge with Lys22. Compound 6h (Figure 3) was measured to be the most
potent inhibitor against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, IC50 = 20.76
and 16.06 μM, respectively (lowest docking score = −7.8
kcal/mol, Table 3).
The binding landscape of the ligand–receptor complex incorporates
hydrophobic interactions between residue Val30 with the carbons of
six-membered ring of the indoline moiety (bond distance = 3.88 and
3.85 Å) as well as residue Val80 and alkyl linker (bond distance
= 3.80 Å).

This is accompanied by two hydrogen bonds between
the hydrogen bond donors Lys50 and Met99 with the sp2-hybridized
nitrogen of the imidazole and carbonyl of the indoline-2,3-dione,
respectively (bond distance = 2.00 and 1.90 Å; bond angle = 157.21°
and 157.05°, respectively). A salt bridge facilitates an electron
shuttle between the sp3-hybridized nitrogen of the triazole
which becomes protonated and residue Asp165, bond distance = 4.12
Å). The interaction network of the second most active inhibitor,
compound 6g, is similar to compound 6h (Figure 3); however, it comprises
fewer hydrophobic interactions, which is compensated by an increased
number of hydrogen bonds. The two van der Waals interactions exist
between residue Val80 with the alkyl linker and Asp103 with the methyl
group of the imidazole ring (bond distance = 3.78 Å).

Four
distinct hydrogen bonds which confer inhibition occur between the
proton donor residues Ser26 and the oxygen of the nitro functional
group, Lys50, and the sp2-hybridized nitrogen of the triazole
ring, Met99, and the oxygen of the indoline moiety as well as the
proton acceptor residue Asp165 and the sp2-hybridized nitrogen
of the triazole ring (bond distance = 3.23, 2.27, 1.89 and 2.39 Å;
bond angle = 136.17°, 138.48°, 154.26° and 125.62°,
respectively). A salt bridge exists between the sp3-hybridized
nitrogen of the triazole which becomes protonated and residue Asp165,
(bond distance = 4.32 Å) like compound 6h.

Two compounds were identified as potential candidates as anti-BC
agents in both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell-lines with the aid of
further derivatisation, these include conjugates 6l and 7d. The complexes of these two ligands share a similar binding
profile with contributions specifically from hydrophobic interactions
and hydrogen bonds. There are five notable van der Waals interactions
between: Leu22/Val30/Ala48/Met99 and the six-membered ring of the
indoline moiety, as well as Phe166 with the methyl group of the imidazole
ring (bond distance = 3.99, 3.71/3.87, 3.97 and 3.90 Å, respectively).
A well-defined network of hydrogen bonds is observed between hydrogen
bond donors: Ser26/Lys176 with oxygen of the nitroimidazole moiety,
Lys50/Gly167 with nitrogen of the imidazole ring, and Met99 with the
carbonyl oxygen adjacent to the amine of the indoline pharmacophore
(bond distance = 2.03, 2.03, 2.06, 3.07, and 2.62 Å; bond angle
= 163.38°, 173.54°, 158.68°, 130.33°, and 145.78°,
respectively).

Compound 7d exhibited an additional
hydrogen bond interaction between the donor Leu22 and the terminal
amine of the hydrazinecarbothioamide (bond distance = 1.95 and 2.15;
bond angle = 146.25 and 139.07). A pertinent difference in the binding
profile of compound 6l over compound 7d in
the form of a salt bridge, which facilitates the transfer of electrons
between Asp165 and the sp3-hybridized nitrogen of the triazole,
may be directly responsible for the improved inhibition highlighted
against the MDA-MB-231 cell-line (IC50 = 56.18 (6l) and 70.40 (7d) μM).

It is further surmised
that the length of the alkyl chain can be no shorter that four/five
carbons long, if any shorter the salt bridge may be disrupted through
space by the electron-withdrawing effect of chloride and nitro groups.
This effect is negated in the imidazole–isatin–thiosemicarbazones,
whereby the presence of the hydrazinecarbothioamide has an electron-donating
effect to compensate thus improving the inhibitory activity of alkyl
chain lengths of two/three carbons.

Table 4 highlights the physical properties of the
designed inhibitors. It is evident that in order for the isatin conjugate
to be active against both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, the ligand
must maintain an overall more hydrophobic nature (TPSA = 131.73 Å2 for both compounds 6g and 6h).
The log P further supports this, as compounds 6g, 6h, and 6l have a higher partition
co-efficient which indicates improved lipophilicity. This study has
revealed high value scaffolds in the development of anti-BC chemotherapies
capable of multi-targeting different types of BCs. This work provides
a platform on to which further development of the selective inhibitors
can be pursued as selectivity toward a triple negative BC cell-line
is rarely observed with imidazole derivatives.

Conclusion
In
conclusion,
a series of 1H-1,2,3-triazole tethered imidazole–isatin
conjugates and imidazole–isatin–thiosemicarbazones were
synthesized and evaluated against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.
Although the compounds were not as active as the standard compound
plumbagin, some of the conjugates showed comparable activity to that
of TAM. The conjugate 6h, with an optimum combination
of pentyl chain length as spacer and a chloro-substituent on the isatin
ring, exhibited IC50s of 20.76 and 16.06 μM against
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively, but also seemed to
inhibit the growth of the control cells HEK-293 with an IC50 value of 12.11 μM. However, compounds 6g, 6l, and 7d with promising IC50s against
the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines proved to be noncytotoxic to HEK-293
and can be taken further as possible anti-BC agents.

Experimental
Section
General Information
1H NMR spectra were
recorded
in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 with a
JEOL 400 (400 MHz) and Bruker 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer using TMS
as an internal standard. Chemical shift values are expressed as parts
per million downfield from TMS and J values are expressed
in hertz. Splitting patterns in the obtained NMR’s are indicated
as s: singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, m: multiplet, dd: double doublet,
ddd: doublet of a doublet of a doublet, and br: broad peak. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL 400 (100 MHz) and Bruker 500
(125 MHz) spectrometer in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 using TMS as an internal standard. HRMS were recorded
on a Bruker-micrOTOF-Q II spectrometer.

Materials and Methods
The cytotoxicity studies of the synthesized
conjugates viz. 6a–l and 7a–l was tested on two different BC cell lines, namely, ER positive (ER+)
MCF-7 cells and triple negative MDA-MB-231 (ER−) using MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-z-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay.28

Cell Culturing
MCF-7 cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s media Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
and MDA-MB 231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin, both incubated at 37 °C
and 5% carbon dioxide.

MTT Assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 5000 cells
per well in triplicate in media. After 24 h, the test compounds, diluted
in complete DMEM were added to each well. Cells were treated with
a range of different concentrations of drug (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100
μM) for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide.28 Subsequently, sterile 5 μL of 5 mg/mL
MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was added
to each well and incubated with cells for 2 h. Solubilization solution
(10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM HCl) of equal volume to the wells
was then added to each well, which was incubated with cells for 16
h at 37 °C. The optical density of each well was read at 570
nm using a microtiter plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific Multiskan
GO Microplate Reader, SkanIt software).32

Statistical Analysis
The
statistical analysis was performed using Excel, and IC50 values were estimated using Graph pad Prism5 software (Hearne Scientific
Software). The experiments were performed in duplicate and the statistical
significance was calculated using Student’s t-test.29a A p-value of
less than 0.05 was used to estimate the significance of the observations.
A Z-factor was calculated for each 96-well plate and assays having
Z-factor above >0.5 were included in the statistical analysis.33

Docking Methods
The X-ray crystal
structures of the IGF-1 receptor (PDB ID: 1JQH) was obtained from
the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). Using the UCSF Chimera package the ligand and receptor complexes
were prepared for docking.34 Chem3D Ultra
was used to construct a three-dimensional (3D) structure of the native
ligand and most active isatin conjugates. The 3D structure of the
compounds was further optimized using the force field, MMFF94s in
the Avogadro package (V 1.2.0). AutoDock Tools (V 1.5.6) was used
to establish the grid box parameters. All nonpolar hydrogens were
merged, Gasteiger partial atomic charges added, and rotatable bonds
assigned. The grid box of the complex had a grid spacing of 0.375
Å. The parameter of the grid points are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Autodock Vina was used
to perform the docking of each ligand into the IGF-1 receptor in triplicate.35 The docking systems were validated by redocking
the ligand of the protein crystal structures into the binding site.
The protein–ligand interaction profiler was used to analyze
the nonpolar interactions between the protein and ligand in complex.36
