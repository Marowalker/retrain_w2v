Noncoding RNA molecules are composed
of a large variety of noncanonical
base pairs that shape up their functionally competent folded structures.
Each base pair is composed of at least two interbase hydrogen bonds
(H-bonds). It is expected that the characteristic geometry and stability
of different noncanonical base pairs are determined collectively by
the properties of these interbase H-bonds. We have studied the ground-state
electronic properties [using density functional theory (DFT) and DFT-D3-based
methods] of all the 118 normal base pairs and 36 modified base pairs,
belonging to 12 different geometric families (cis and trans of WW,
WH, HH, WS, HS, and SS) that occur in a nonredundant set of high-resolution
RNA crystal structures. Having addressed some of the limitations of
the earlier approaches, we provide here a comprehensive compilation
of the average energies of different types of interbase H-bonds (EHB). We have also characterized each interbase
H-bond using 13 different parameters that describe its geometry, charge
distribution at its bond critical point (BCP), and n → σ*-type
charge transfer from filled π orbitals of the H-bond acceptor
to the empty antibonding orbital of the H-bond donor. On the basis
of the extent of their linear correlation with the H-bonding energy,
we have shortlisted five parameters to model linear equations for
predicting EHB values. They are (i) electron
density at the BCP: ρ, (ii) its Laplacian: ∇2ρ, (iii) stabilization energy due to n → σ*-type
charge transfer: E(2), (iv) donor–hydrogen
distance, and (v) hydrogen–acceptor distance. We have performed
single variable and multivariable linear regression analysis over
the normal base pairs and have modeled sets of linear relationships
between these five parameters and EHB.
Performance testing of our model over the set of modified base pairs
shows promising results, at least for the moderately strong H-bonds.

1 Introduction
Until
recently, the functional roles of RNA were thought to be
limited mainly because of its participation in gene expression in
the form of the messenger RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and transfer RNAs.1 However, in the past 2 decades, the ever-increasing
discoveries of the catalytic2 and regulatory3 roles of non (protein)coding RNAs (ncRNA) have
trashed the established rules to make way for new ones (see the Supporting Information).4,5 Recent
discoveries of CRISPRs (clusters of regularly interspersed short palindromic
repeats6) and scanRNAs (small conjugation-specific
RNA7) suggest that ncRNAs can even intervene
at the genome itself and modify DNA. To participate in these diverse
cellular functions, RNA molecules have to fold into functionally competent
structures, which are inherently complex. The understanding of how
RNA, having essentially only four types of nucleobases [adenine (A),
guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U)], can display such a variety
and complexity is still far from complete. A detailed analysis of
base pairing interactions, however, may provide significant points
toward this understanding.

As shown in Figure 1, each nucleobase can be characterized by
three edges—Watson–Crick
(W), Hoogsteen (H), and Sugar (S). A base pair is formed when two
bases interact noncovalently, each respectively involving one of these
three edges, and form a considerably planar geometry with at least
two interbase hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). Depending on the mutual orientation
of the glycosidic bonds within a base pair, it can be annotated as
either cis or trans.8 The cis-type interactions
between the Watson–Crick edges of two complementary bases (G:C
and A:U/T) are known as canonical base pairs, as they are predominantly
found within the double helical stretches of both DNA and RNA. All
other possible base pairs are categorized as noncanonical base pairs.
Unlike the double-stranded DNA, the single-stranded RNA folds onto
itself to form a large repertoire of noncanonical base pairs.8 On the basis of the identities of the interacting
edges, Leontis and Westhof have organized all these base pairs into
12 geometric classes, viz., WW, WH, HH, HS, WS, and SS (cis and trans).8 It is theoretically possible to have a total
of 144 different types of base pairing geometries. However, because
of lack of complementary H-bonding network and other structural and
functional constraints, only 118 types of base pairs are actually
observed in available RNA crystal structures.9 These base pairing interactions lead to the formation of double
helical stem regions (dominated by canonical base pairs) and loop
regions (characterized by unpaired bases and noncanonical base pairs)
in RNA. In a folded RNA, such stem and loop regions further interact
with each other via tertiary interactions. Combination of such interconnected
structural components is often observed recurrently as a conserved
(in terms of both sequence and structure) modular unit in various
RNA molecules and is known as an RNA motif.10 In this context, a reasonable hypothesis could be that different
sets of noncanonical base pairs due to their characteristic geometry,
stability, and physicochemical properties provide the diversity required
to shape up the structure and dynamics of these RNA motifs and thereby
the folding of the overall RNA molecule.11

Figure 1 (a)
RNA bases have been characterized by three edges—Watson–Crick,
Hoogsteen (C–H edge for pyrimidines), and Sugar. (b) In principle,
any edge of a base can interact with any other edge of a second base.
Depending on the mutual orientation of the two glycosidic bonds, the
base pair can be annotated as either cis or trans.

Given that variations in the properties of the
constituent interbase
H-bonds collectively determine the variations in geometry and stability
of noncanonical base pairs, it is important to analyze the properties
of individual interbase H-bonds to delineate the role of noncanonical
base pairs in RNA folding. It is important to note here that in addition
to interbase H-bonds, other inter-residue H-bonds (viz., base–phosphate12 and base–sugar13 interactions) are also important for shaping up the complex folded
structure of RNA. However, in this work, we have only focused on the
interbase H-bonds. On the basis of the identity of H-bond donor and
acceptor atoms, all the interbase H-bonds present in RNA base pairs
can be classified into six different types, viz., N–H···N,
N–H···O, O–H···N, O–H···O,
C–H···N, and C–H···O.11 Energetically, such interbase H-bonds are either
weak (H-bonding energy (EHB) < 4 kcal
mol–1) or moderately strong (EHB = 4–15 kcal mol–1).14 However, evaluation of the geometry and energetics
of H-bonds in base pairing systems continue to pose a formidable challenge
for both experimental and theoretical investigations. As discussed
in earlier reviews,15−17 most of the experimental methods provide only qualitative
details about individual H-bonds, especially in complex biological
molecules. In practice, very few methods are available for the quantitative
estimation of the H-bond strengths via experiments, for example, (a)
studying the modulations in the IR spectra as a result of H-bond formation
such as red shift of D–H stretching vibration frequency, increase
in IR intensity, and so forth,18 (b) using
experimental tools such as temperature-dependent field ionization
mass spectrometry,19 calorimetry,20−22 or vibrational predissociation spectroscopy23 in order to calculate the dissociation energy of the hydrogen-bonded
complex, and (c) studying the alteration in magnetic properties of
the system owing to hydrogen bonding.24 Also, unlike covalent bonds, the correlation between the geometry
of a H-bond (say, H-bond length) and its strength is not straightforward.14

To overcome the limitations of the experimental
methods and to
evaluate the strength of individual H-bonds, numerous theoretical
approaches have been implemented till date.25 Among them, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) approach
is arguably the most widely used theoretical tool to understand the
H-bonding interaction.26,27 Several efforts have also been
made to relate the QTAIM-based parameters with the strength of individual
hydrogen bonds. For example, (a) the complex-derived Grabowski parameters
relating geometric and topological parameters to the H-bonding strength,28 (b) the relationship given by Espinosa et al.29 providing H-bond dissociation energy (De) using the virial density (Vel), and (c) the linear relationship between intermolecular
complex stabilization energy and electronic charge density (ρ)
or it’s Laplacian (∇2ρ) at the bond
critical point (BCP) (where ∇ρ = 0) have been proposed
for different H-bonded molecular systems,30−34 including base pairs.35−38 Although extensively used,13,39−42 the QTAIM-based approaches have their limitations as discussed in
the Supporting Information. However, it
is to be noted that the theoretical basis of QTAIM is based on electron
density which is an experimentally measurable quantity. Another such
approach, based on experimentally measurable quantity, is the use
of vibrational spectroscopy. Advanced quantum mechanics-based methods
can replicate the experimentally observed vibrational spectroscopy
to a reasonable extent, at least for the nucleobases.43−47 Using the empirical Iogansen’s relationship,18 the H-bond (D–H···A) formation enthalpy
(EHB) can be measured from the red shift
in the D–H bond stretching frequency, which takes place because
of H-bond formation. For intramolecular hydrogen bonds in a wide variety
of biological systems, Nikolaienko and co-workers have established
the correlation between these two theoretical approaches (QTAIM and
vibrational spectroscopy) for estimating the H-bonding energy of individual
H-bonds.48 Later, Hovorun and co-workers
have implemented Iogansen’s relationship to study the H-bonding
energy of the intermolecular H-bonds present in unconventional DNA
base pairs.49−52 Another effective and widely used53−58 approach is provided by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis,59,60 which calculates the stabilization energy associated with the charge
transfer from the filled π orbital of the H-bond acceptor (A)
to the corresponding empty antibonding orbital of the H-bond donor
(D–H). In addition to these, estimating H-bonding energies
using different properties of the compliance matrix is another less
frequently used, but promising, theoretical approach.61,62 Interestingly, all these different theoretical techniques have been
implemented to extensively study the canonical base pairs in DNA (A:T/G:C)51,63−67 because they are the so-called “heterogeneous” systems,
where different categories of interbase H-bonds (N–H···N,
N–H···O, C–H···O, etc.)
are present in a single base pair. However, a consensus between these
different computational approaches is lacking in the present literature.
Here, we attempt to study the interrelations between these different
computational approaches for interbase H-bonds present in RNA base
pairs.

In this work, we have selected all the 118 types of RNA
base pairs
and analyzed the H-bonding energy of all their interbase H-bonds using
Iogansen’s relationship.18 Each
of the interbase H-bonds has been characterized by a total of 13 parameters,
among which 6 are geometry-based (i.e., based on the relative positions
of the H-bond donor, H-bond acceptor, and the hydrogen atom), 6 are
topology- or QTAIM-based, and 1 is charge-transfer-based. All calculations
have been performed using appropriate hybrid-generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) density functional theory (DFT) functional, and
the effect of dispersion interactions has been incorporated using
DFT-D3 formalism. We have shortlisted the parameters that display
significantly good linear correlation with the H-bonding energy (EHB) of all types of H-bonds (N–H···O,
N–H···N, etc.). For these short-listed parameters,
different sets of linear relationships between them and the H-bonding
energies have been modeled using single variable and multivariable
linear regression analyses. We have tested the performance of our
models over a set of 36 modified base pairs (base pairs where the
participating bases undergo post-transcriptional modifications), which
are found in a nonredundant set of high-resolution RNA crystal structures.
We have been able to achieve a root-mean-square error (RMSE) as low
as 0.3 kcal mol–1 between the expected and predicted
set of EHB values. Because, compared to
the calculation of QTAIM or NBO parameters, calculation of vibrational
spectroscopy is computationally expensive (and practically not feasible
to perform for larger systems at a high level of theory), these sets
of linear equations will provide a useful basis for obtaining reasonably
accurate EHB values without performing
expensive Hessian calculations.

2 Methods
2.1 Geometry Optimization of Selected RNA Base
Pairs
We have studied all the 118 different geometries of
normal base pairs and 36 modified base pairs that occur in the nonredundant
set of high-resolution (resolution cutoff = 3.5 Å) RNA crystal
structures provided by the HD-RNAS68 database.
Gas-phase optimized geometries [B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level] of all the
normal RNA base pairs are curated in the RNABP COGEST9 database. The hybrid GGA functional B3LYP69−71 is arguably the most widely used DFT functional for studying DNA
and RNA base pairs37,72−80 and similar systems.81,82 Therefore, for the initial calculations,
we have collected the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level optimized geometries
of different normal base pairs from the RNABP COGEST database. Gas-phase
optimized geometry of modified base pairs, at the same level of theory,
has been taken from the supporting information of the recent article
by Seelam et al.83 Hessian calculation
has been performed over the optimized geometries of all the normal
and modified base pairs. For some of the normal base pairs, Hessian
calculation results in imaginary frequencies because the corresponding
optimized geometries present in RNABP COGEST are obtained from constrained
optimization. These systems have been reoptimized. We have found that
some of the reoptimized geometries are also associated with imaginary
frequencies (as listed in the Supporting Information), and we have removed those cases from our study. The remaining
systems are composed of 17 WW, 17 WH, 12 HH, 22 WS, 22 HS, and 13
SS pairs. Out of this final set of 103 base pairs, optimized geometries
of 96 base pairs are the same as the one given in the RNABP COGEST
database and geometries of rest 7 base pairs are obtained after reoptimization.
They are G:C W:W Trans, A:G H:H Cis, A:U(II) H:H Trans, C:U H:H Trans,
G:G H:H Trans, A:A W:H Trans, and G:rA H:S Cis. In order to incorporate
the effects of dispersion interaction, they are further optimized
using the B3LYP-D3(BJ) functional and the same basis set. In B3LYP-D3(BJ),
the dispersion correction has been added explicitly by Grimme’s
method (3rd order) with Becke–Johnson damping.84,85 All real frequencies were observed for B3LYP-D3(BJ) optimized systems
on Hessian calculation. Similarly, for all the monomers, geometry
optimization and subsequent Hessian calculation have been performed
using both B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ) functionals with the 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set, respectively. Note that B3LYP and its dispersion-corrected
version B3LYP-D3(BJ) are arguably the most universally used DFT functionals
to study the nucleic acid-based systems.86,87 All the calculations were performed using Gaussian03 software.88

2.2 Interaction Energy of a
Base Pair
Interaction energy of a base pair AB has been calculated
as the difference
between the electronic energy of the base pair AB (EAB) and sum of the electronic energies of the individual
bases (EA and EB). All the interaction energies are further corrected for zero-point
vibrational energy (ZPVE), basis set superposition error (BSSE) (EBSSE), and deformation energy (Edef), that is, Eint = EAB – (EA + EB) + Edef + EBSSE + EZPVE. Further
details on the method of interaction energy calculation are discussed
in the Supporting Information.

2.3 Different Types of Interbase H-Bonds
Potential H-bond
donor groups present in the nucleobases are primary
amino groups (NI–H), secondary amino groups (NII–H), hydroxyl group (Oh–H), and
C–H group. On the other hand, potential H-bond acceptor groups
present in the nucleobases are imino nitrogens (NIII),
carbonyl oxygen (Oc), and hydroxyl oxygen (Oh). Table 1 shows the
count of different types of H-bonds studied in this work. Note that
amino acceptor interactions77,79 observed in Hoogsteen–Sugar
base pairs are not included in this study as they occur only in a
specific set of RNA base pairs.

2.4 H-Bonding Energy from Iogansen’s
Relationship
For all the D–H···A-type
interbase H-bonds,
we have calculated the red shift (ΔνD–H) of the D–H stretching vibrational frequency as ΔνD–H = νD–Hfree – νD–HBP, where νD–Hfree and νD–HBP are
the vibrational frequencies corresponding to the D–H bond stretching
in the isolated monomer and in the H-bonded base pair, respectively.
As prescribed in the Gaussian03 manual, all the vibrational frequencies
are scaled by a factor 0.96 to obtain the values consistent with experimental
results. We have calculated the H-bonding energy (EHB) from Iogansen’s relationship,18 which is 1  

Note that Iogansen’s relationship
allows us to estimate the H-bonding energy only for the red-shifted
H-bonds with ΔνD–H > 40 cm–1. In this context, it is also important to mention that earlier works
that implement Iogansen’s relationship to evaluate the strength
of interbase H-bonds49−52 have taken special care (partial deuteration of the O–H,
N–H, and NH2 groups involved in the interbase H-bonding)
to minimize the effect of vibrational resonances. In this work, we
have not taken any such measure. However, we confirm that in the numerically
calculated IR spectra of all the base pairs, the symmetric stretching
of each N–H, O–H, and C–H bond (that form interbase
H-bonds) corresponds to a unique peak having high intensity (see Figure 3). Therefore, we
can safely assume that the influences of vibrational resonance on
our results are negligible.

2.5 Characterization of Interbase
H-Bonds Using
QTAIM Analysis
The QTAIM analysis has been performed over
the wave functions corresponding to the ground-state optimized geometry
of the base pairs obtained at both B3LYP/6-31+g(d,p) and B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31+g(d,p)
levels of theory. We have found that all the interbase H-bonds are
associated with a bond path such that at the BCP, the slope of the
gradient of the electron density distribution is positive (∇2ρ > 0). We have calculated the following six topological
parameters at the BCPs corresponding to the interbase H-bonds. They
are (i) electron density (ρ), (ii) slope of the gradient of
the electron density distribution (∇2ρ), (iii)
potential energy density (V), (iv) kinetic energy
density (G), (v) total energy density (Htot = V + G), and (vi)
ellipticity (ε).a These topological parameters
are frequently used in the literature to estimate H-bonding strength.
QTAIM calculations have been performed using standalone AIMALL package.89

2.6 Characterization of Interbase
H-Bonds Using
NBO Analysis
NBO analysis has been performed on the optimized
geometries obtained using both B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) and B3LYP-D3/6-31G+(d,p)
levels of theory. These calculations have been done using the NBO
package90 as implemented in Gaussian03.88 The second-order perturbative energy has been
estimated between the different Lewis-type “filled”
(donor) and non-Lewis-type “empty” (acceptor) orbitals.
These interactions are also referred to as “delocalization
interactions” as they are a result of the donation of occupancy
from the localized NBOs of the idealized Lewis structure into the
empty non-Lewis orbitals, thereby showing a departure from the idealized
Lewis structure description. The second-order perturbative energy
(E(2)) resulting due to delocalization can be estimated
for a donor NBO (i) and acceptor NBO (j) as 2  where qi is the donor orbital occupancy, εi, and εj are diagonal elements
(orbital energies), and F(i,j) is the off-diagonal NBO Fock matrix element. A higher
value of E(2) represents a stronger H-bonding interaction.
In this work, we will refer to the E(2) parameter
as “charge-transfer-based parameter”.

2.7 Characterization of the Geometry of an Interbase
H-Bond
We have considered the geometry of a hydrogen bond
as a triangle between the three atoms—donor (D), hydrogen (H),
and acceptor (A) (see the Supporting Information). We have selected three distances (lengths of the three sides of
the triangle DA, AH, and DH), the donor–hydrogen–acceptor
angle (∠DHA), and the area (ΔDHA) of the DHA
triangle and its perimeter (SDHA) to explore
how the strength of the corresponding H-bonds depends on them.

2.8 Linear Regression Analysis
For different
H-bonds, we have calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the EHB values (say,
dataset {y1, ..., yn}) and six topological parameters, six geometric
parameters, and the stabilization energy E(2) obtained
from NBO analysis (say, dataset {x1, ..., xn}). The Pearson correlation
coefficient (r) between the two data sets {x1, ..., xn} and {y1, ..., yn} (having the average values x̅ and y®,
respectively) is defined as 3  

We have further
performed single variable
and multivariable linear regression analysis to establish linear relationships
between the EHB and other topology-based,
geometry-based, or charge-transfer-based parameters, following the
standard least-square fit-based approach. All the interbase H-bonds
studied here contribute toward the stabilization of the base pairs
containing them, and hence, their energies must be represented as
a negative value. However, for the ease of discussion, in the following
text, all the H-bonding energies are reported in terms of their magnitude
and hence have the positive sign.

3 Results
and Discussion
It may be reiterated here at the outset that
this approach toward
estimating the average energy of a particular type of interbase H-bond
has a limitation. It can be applied only to the H-bonds where the
red shift in D–H bond stretching is >40 cm–1. As discussed elaborately in the following sections, C–H···O
and C–H···N bonds found in RNA base pairs are
usually associated with a small red shift or blue shift of the C–H
bond stretching. Therefore, though improper C–H···O/N-type
H-bonds are important factors that govern the geometries and stabilities
of nucleic acid base pairs,91,92 we are not able to
analyze their properties in detail. It may be noted that out of the
remaining eight types of interbase H-bonds listed in Table 1, there are four bonds (serial
numbers 5–8) that involve the sugar O2′ (either as donor
or as acceptor, or both). Hence, they are found only in Sugar edge-mediated
base pairs, that is, in the base pairs belonging to the WS, HS, or
SS families. As shown later, EHB values
of these four types of H-bonds do not show strong correlation with
any of the topology-based, charge-transfer-based, or geometry-based
parameters. In contrast, the other four types of H-bonds (serial numbers
1–4 in Table 1) are found in all types of base pairs and their EHB correlate well with some specific parameters studied
in this work. Hence, majority of our discussions are focused on these
four interbase H-bonds. They are as follows: NI–H···NIII, NII–H···NIII, NI–H···Oc, and NII–H···Oc.

3.1 Average
H-Bonding Energy of Different Types
of Interbase H-Bonds
Calculating the average H-bonding energy
(E®HB) for different
types of interbase H-bonds that shape up the geometry and stability
of noncanonical base pairs has been attempted earlier.93 There it has been assumed that the total interaction
energy (Eint) of a base pair is solely
contributed by the interbase H-bonds present in them, that is, Eint = ∑i=1nEHBi, where n is the number of H-bonds present
between the two bases and EHBi is the H-bonding energy
of the interbase H-bond i. Therefore, calculations
of Eint values of different base pairs
give rise to a set of linear equations, which can further be solved
to get the energetic contribution of each type of H-bonds (N–H···N,
N–H···O, etc.). Another similar approach reported
the H-bonding energies of the interbase H-bonds present in DNA base
pairs.94 However, later investigations95,96 in this area have highlighted that in addition to interbase H-bonds,
other factors, mainly charge delocalization, dipole–dipole
interaction, London dispersion forces, and so forth, also contribute
to the stability of base pairs. This means that for an RNA base pair, Ediff = Eint –
ΣEHB is a nonzero quantity, which
varies with its composition. To illustrate this systematically, we
have calculated the EHB values of individual
interbase H-bonds using the Iogansen’s relationship as discussed
in the Methods section and obtained the Ediff values for all the base pairs belonging
to the WW, WH, and HH families and containing guanine. Note that out
of all the four nucleobases, guanine has the highest dipole moment.97Figure 2 clearly shows that Ediff values
(the red bars) are significantly high, especially for high dipole
moment base pairs such as G:C W:W Cis and G:G W:W Trans. For example,
the interaction energy of the canonical G:C W:W cis base pairs is
−22.8 kcal mol–1 and the sum of the EHB values of three interbase H-bonds present
in it is −16.9 kcal mol–1 at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
level (where negative signs indicate stabilization because of bond
formation). These observations underline the need to revisit the problem
with a different approach.

Figure 2 Comparison of ZPVE- and BSSE-corrected interaction
energy (Eint) of a base pair and the sum
of the H-bonding
energies of the interbase H-bonds present in it. Comparisons are made
on the basis of the magnitude of the energies (in kcal mol–1) for 15 guanine-containing base pairs.

In this work, instead of calculating the interaction energy
of
a base pair for estimating the sum of all the interbase H-bonds present
in it, we have calculated the H-bonding strength of individual H-bonds
themselves (EHB) using Iogansen’s
relationship. Therefore, the average H-bonding energy of a particular
type of H-bond is given by the arithmetic mean of the EHB values of all its instances. Figure 3 illustrates the red shift in the D–H bond stretching
frequency (ΔνD–H) because of D–H···A-type
interbase H-bond formation in two canonical (A:U W:W Cis and G:C W:W
Cis) and two noncanonical (A:U H:H Cis and G:U W:H Trans) base pairs.
From these red shifts, the EHB values
of individual H-bonds are calculated using Iogansen’s relationship,
as discussed in the Methods section. Table 2 shows the average
H-bonding energy (E®HB) for different types of interbase H-bonds calculated using this
approach. Note that earlier attempts toward calculating E®HB values have not discriminated
N–H···N (or N–H···O)-type
H-bonds on the basis of the chemical identity of the donor N–H
group. Our approach allows us to explore these varieties of interbase
H-bonds. Interestingly, we have found that the average energy for
N–H···N type H-bonds strongly depends on the
hybridization state of the donor nitrogen. For NII–H···NIII-type H-bonds (see Table 1 for the annotation of different H-bonds), the average
H-bonding energy is 6.42 kcal mol–1, which is 2.11
kcal mol–1 higher than the average energy of the
NI–H···NIII-type H-bonds
(4.31 kcal mol–1). Similarly, the average H-bonding
strength of the N–H···O hydrogen bonds depends
on the hybridization states of both the donor nitrogen and acceptor
oxygen atoms. The average energies of the NI–H···Oc, NII–H···Oc,
and NI–H···Oh H-bonds
are 2.85, 5.13, and 2.56 kcal mol–1, respectively.
The order of the mutual strengths of different interbase H-bonds can
be explained on the basis of the mutual strengths of the corresponding
H-bond donors and acceptors. The gas-phase acidity of the H-bond donor
sites and gas-phase basicity (or proton affinity) of the H-bond acceptor
sites of different nucleobases provide an overall estimate for their
mutual H-bonding strengths. For nucleobases, a detailed and accurate
estimation of the gas-phase acidity and gas-phase basicity of different
polar sites has been reported by Lee and co-workers.98,99 It suggests that secondary amino groups (NII–H)
are usually more acidic and hence stronger H-bond donors than primary
amino groups (NI–H). Similarly, the exocyclic carboxylic
oxygen groups (Oc) are usually less basic and hence weaker
H-bond acceptors, compared to the imino nitrogen (NIII)
atoms of the purine/pyrimidine rings. This explains why the average
H-bonding energy of NII–H···NIII bonds is higher than that of NII–H···Oc and NI–H···NIII bonds (Table 2).
Also, it justifies the trend that E®HB(NI–H···NIII) > E®HB(NI–H···Oc). Now, given the
trends observed in Table 2 that (a) E®HB(NII–H···NIII) > E®HB(Oh–H···NIII) > E®HB(NI–H···NIII) and (b) E®HB(NII–H···Oc) > E®HB(Oh–H···Oc) > E®HB(NI–H···Oc), we can extend our argument to predict that the sugar O2′–H
is a stronger H-bond donor than the primary amino group but weaker
than the secondary amino group.

Nevertheless, our approach is not
suitable for studying C–H···O
and C–H···N bonds because the red shifts in
the C–H bonds are usually less than 40 cm–1. In our dataset, only 3 out of total 11 C–H···N-type
H-bonds and 1 out of total 14 C–H···O-type H-bonds
show a red shift ΔνC–H, which is greater
than 40 cm–1. Out of the C–H···N
bonds, the maximum red shift (87.36 cm–1) is observed
for the U(C5–H)···(N7)A H-bond in the A:U H:H
Cis pair (Figure 3G).
Again, out of the C–H···O bonds, the U(C5–H)···(O6)G
H-bond in G:U W:H Trans pair (Figure 3H) is associated with a significant red shift (86.92
cm–1). Interestingly, six C–H···O
H-bonds and one C–H···N H-bond in our dataset
are also associated with a blue shift in the C–H bond stretching
(ΔνC–H < 0). The origin of such a
blue shift in the so-called improper hydrogen bonds such as C–H···O/N
has been explained earlier.100 For any
D–H···A-type H-bond, the change in the D–H
bond length and hence in its symmetric stretching frequency is determined
by two competing forces: —(a) the electron affinity of D, which
causes increased electron density at the D–H bond region in
the presence of A and thus promotes D–H bond contraction and
(b) the attractive force between the electron-rich A and positively
charged H that promotes D–H bond elongation. It has been found
that the latter almost always dominates in polar D–H bonds,
whereas the effect of the former is noticeable only in the nonpolar
D–H bonds (C–H in our case) with relatively weaker H-bond
acceptors.100 Therefore, a plausible justification
for the observation that blue shifts in the C–H bond stretching
are more abundant in C–H···O bonds than in C–H···N
bonds can be obtained from the fact that compared to the imino nitrogen
groups (NIII), the exocyclic carboxylic oxygen groups (Oc) are usually weaker H-bond acceptors.98,99

On the basis of the average EHB values,
three out of the eight types of H-bonds listed in Table 2 (NI–H···Oc, NI–H···Oh, and
Oh–H···Oh) can be categorized
as weak H-bond (EHB < 4 kcal mol–1), and the rest five types can be characterized as
moderately strong H-bonds (4 kcal mol–1 < EHB < 15 kcal mol–1). Interestingly,
the weak H-bonds are associated with large standard deviation (Table 2), which is indicative
of their flexible nature. Among the moderately strong H-bonds, NII–H···Oc and NI–H···NIII show significantly high
standard deviation compared to other H-bonds and are therefore expected
to have higher flexibility. Therefore, it is expected that noncanonical
base pairs composed of these two H-bonds will have flexible geometry.
Two such base pairing geometries are G:C W:W Trans and G:G W:H Cis.
Each of them is composed of only two H-bonds: one NII–H···Oc and one NI–H···NIII, and their native geometries are indeed flexible.101 They are known to deviate significantly from their respective
native geometries under gas-phase geometry optimization at different
levels of theory.102 On gas-phase geometry
optimization, the G:C W:W Trans base pair deviates from the reverse
Watson–Crick geometry to form a bifurcated geometry, whereas
the G:G W:H Cis base pair converges to a G:G W:W Trans geometry. Further
studies show that they require support either from the formation of
higher-order interactions103 or from the
buildup of positive charge environment at the Hoogsteen edge of the
guanine residue to stabilize their respective native geometries. The
positive charge buildup may take place in the form of metal ion coordination,104−106 post-transcriptional modification,107 or even nucleobase protonation.108 These
observations demonstrate how the geometries and stabilities of different
noncanonical base pairs are determined by their constituent interbase
H-bonds.

Another important trend, as shown in Table 2, is that the average H-bonding
energy of
the interbase H-bonds of WS, HS, and SS base pairs is smaller than
the same present in WW, WH, and HH base pairs. This trend is consistent
with the fact that the base pairing interactions forming via the sugar
edge are comparatively flexible than others and are therefore unstable
under QM-based gas-phase geometry optimization.73−75,77,79 We have also found
that the influences of the dispersion interactions on the individual
H-bonding energies are small (|EHB(B3LYP)
– EHB(B3LYP-D3(BJ))| < 0.25
kcal mol–1), except the sugar O2′-mediated
H-bonds. For the sugar O2′-mediated H-bonds, the average H-bonding
energies calculated in the presence and absence of dispersion corrections
are significantly different. Our results are in line with the earlier
literature studies, which underscore the importance of dispersion
interactions in stabilizing the base pairs of WS,74,75 HS,77,79 and SS73 families.
As mentioned in the Methods section, for each
of the interbase H-bonds, we have calculated 13 different parameters
based on their geometry, topology of the corresponding BCP, and associated
charge transfer. We have tried to find out the correlation between
the H-bonding energy and these 13 parameters.

3.2 How Well
Do the Topology-Based, Geometry–Based,
and Charge-Transfer-Based Parameters Correlate with the H-Bonding
Energies?
Pearson correlation coefficients (r) calculated between the H-bonding energies obtained from vibrational
spectroscopy (EHB) and different geometry-based,
topology-based, and charge-transfer-based parameters are shown in Table 3. It may be noted
that though the trends observed are similar, there are noticeable
differences between the values obtained using B3LYP and B3LYP-D3(BJ)
functionals. In most of the cases, the Pearson correlation coefficient
(r) is better with the values obtained using the
dispersion-corrected B3LYP-D3(BJ) functional and has hence been used
for our detailed analysis. Further to note is that we have limited
our discussion below to the H-bond types 1–4 as listed in Table 3. As explained at
the beginning of the section, H-bond types 5–8 are excluded
from the discussion because they show poor correlation between EHB and other parameters.

For these
four types of hydrogen bonds, some of the parameters
show remarkably good linear correlation (|r| ≥
0.9). Out of them, the best correlation with the EHB values is displayed by the E(2) values
obtained from NBO calculations. E(2) values correspond
to the stabilization energy because of n → σ*-type charge
transfer from the π orbital of the H-bond acceptor to the corresponding
antibonding orbital of the H-bond donor (N–H, O–H, or
C–H bond). Therefore, our results suggest that for H-bonds
with red-shifted D–H bonds, the extent of n → σ*
charger transfer determines the H-bonding strength. This is in line
with the justification for the electronic basis of H-bonding given
by Alabugin and co-workers.109 We further
observe that correlation between E(2) and EHB is the maximum for the two strongest H-bonds
found in the studied RNA base pairs (Table 2). They are (i) NI–H···NIII bonds (r = 0.94 for H-bonds observed in
base pairs of the WW, WH, and HH families) and (ii) NII–H···Oc bonds (r = 0.97 for H-bonds observed in the base pairs of the WS, HS, and
SS families).

The set of geometry-based parameters consists
of three interatomic
distances (D–A, D–H, and H–A); the angle described
by H-bond donor, hydrogen, and H-bond acceptor (∠DHA); the
perimeter of the DHA triangle (SDHA) and
its area (ΔDHA). As discussed earlier,100,109 n → σ*-type charge transfer from the π orbital
of the H-bond acceptor to the antibonding orbital of the H-bond donor
results into elongation of the corresponding σ bond (N–H,
O–H, or C–H). Therefore, the change in D–H distance
due to H-bonding is inherently connected to the concomitant red shift.
This rationalizes the observation that out of the three interatomic
distances, D–H shows exceptionally good correlation (|r| ≥ 0.95) with the H-bonding strength of all the
four types of H-bonds (Table 3). Such weakening of the D–H σ bonds is linked
to the attractive interaction between the acceptor and hydrogen atoms.
Consequently, we have found that the extent of weakening of the N–H/O–H
bonds is also strongly correlated with the H-bonding energies calculated
from Iogansen’s relationship (r = 0.95 for
all the H-bonds present in all the base pairs of the WW family).b Hence, the H–A distances are significantly
well correlated (|r| ≥ 0.85) with the H-bonding
strength of all the four types of H-bonds. This also explains why
the perimeter of the DHA triangle SDHA shows reasonably good correlation with the corresponding H-bonding
strengths. We further note that consistent with the recent reports,110 the correlations between EHB and D–A distances are comparatively poor (|r| < 0.8) for all kinds of H-bonds. It is therefore intuitive
that the strength of an interbase H-bond (D–H···A)
does not depend strongly on the corresponding ∠DHA and the
geometry-based parameters derived from that (e.g., the area of the
DHA triangle, ΔDHA). Hence, as shown in Table 3, ∠DHA and
ΔDHA display comparatively poor correlation (|r| < 0.8) with the corresponding H-bonding strengths
(EHB).

Unlike the charge-transfer-based
and geometry-based parameters,
the physical origin of the relationship between the H-bonding energies
and topological parameters calculated at the corresponding BCPs is
not well understood. Out of the six topological parameters thus for
each interbase H-bond, the electron density (ρ) shows good correlation
(0.95 ≥ |r| ≥ 0.88) with the EHB values for all the four interbase H-bonds.
On the other hand, the ellipticity (ε) shows poor correlation
with EHB for all kinds of interbase H-bonds
studied and has therefore not been included in Table 3. Performances of the other four topological
parameters depend on the nature of the H-bond. For example, the Laplacian
of the electron density (∇2ρ) is well correlated
with the EHB values corresponding to the
H-bonds having primary amino group as the donor (N6 of adenine, N4
of cytosine, and N2 of guanine), but for the H-bonds having secondary
amino groups as the donor (N1 of guanine and N3 of uracil) the correlation
is comparatively poor. Similar trend is also observed for the potential
energy density (V) and kinetic energy density (G). Table 3 suggests that the poor correlation is explicitly due to those NII–H···NIII and NII–H···Oc bonds which are present
exclusively in the base pairs belonging to the WW, WH, and HH families.
Interestingly, the Pearson correlation coefficient between EHB and the total energy density (Htot) shows remarkably different trends for N–H···N
and N–H···O H-bonds, respectively. The correlation
is good for the N–H···N bonds (r = −0.89 and −0.86 for NI–H···NIII and NII–H···NIII bonds, respectively), whereas it is extremely poor for N–H···O
bonds (r = −0.24 and −0.16 for NI–H···Oc and NII–H···Oc bonds, respectively).

On the basis of the above analysis, we may infer that the three
parameters E(2), ρ, and D–H, covering
three different aspects (charge transfer, topology, and geometry,
respectively) display remarkably good (|r| > 0.9)
correlation with the H-bonding energy of all the four different types
of H-bonds, especially when the dispersion corrections are taken into
consideration. Among the remaining 10 parameters, only ∇2ρ and H–A are the two parameters, which show
good correlation (0.9 < |r| < 0.85) with EHB for all the four different types of H-bonds.
Therefore, these five parameters are shortlisted as potential candidates
for modeling linear relationships with EHB. These models will be useful to estimate the H-bonding energy of
individual H-bonds.

3.3 Modeling Linear Relationship
between EHB and Other Topology-Based,
Charge-Transfer–Based,
and Geometry-Based Parameters
We have modeled linear equations
linking the above-mentioned topology-based, charge-transfer-based,
and geometry-based parameters with the H-bonding energy calculated
from vibrational spectroscopy (EHB). To
benchmark the efficiency of our models, we have selected a set of
36 modified base pairs. They occur naturally in a nonredundant set
of high-resolution RNA crystal structures (HDRNAS68). Their occurrence contexts, structures, and possible contribution
in the structural dynamics of functional RNAs have been analyzed recently
by Seelam et al.83 The modified base pairs
constitute an ideal test set for our model because their overall physicochemical
properties are reasonably close to our training set (normal base pairs),
but at the same time, they possess a significant amount of chemical
variations. Both the bases are modified in 2 of these 36 modified
base pairs (m2G:Um W:WC and Cm:Gm W:WC), whereas the rest
of the base pairs are composed of one normal base and one modified
base. Among these 36 base pairs, 12 base pairs have modification in
the sugar moiety in the form of methylation at O2′ position.
Others display different nucleobase modifications, such as m2G (2 base pairs), s4U (3 base pairs), m5C (3
base pairs), m5U(3 base pairs), m7G (2 base
pairs), D (3 base pairs), m22G (2 base pairs),
m62A (1 base pair), and Ψ (5 base pairs).
Note that we have removed the base pairs containing m7G
modification as they are charged systems. In the rest 34 base pairs,
we have identified 56 hydrogen bonds which are associated with a red
shift greater than 40 cm–1, and therefore, the corresponding
hydrogen bonding energies can be calculated using Iogansen’s
relationship. Among them, 6 are of NI–H···NIII type, 16 are of NII–H···NIII type, 21 are of NI–H···Oc type, and 13 are of NII–H···Oc type.

First, we have performed a single variable linear
regression for all the four hydrogen bonds and modeled the equations
(y = Ax + B) relating EHB with each of the five parameters (ρ,
∇2ρ, E(2), D–H, and
H–A), respectively, following the conventional least-square
fit approach. The slope (A) and the y-intercept (B) of the modeled equations are listed
in Table 4. Similar
linear equations for other seven parameters (V, G, H, D–A, ∠DHA, SDHA, and ΔDHA) are shown in
Table S3 of the Supporting Information.
We have implemented these single variable equations to predict the EHB values of the interbase H-bonds of the modified
base pairs. Mean square error (MSE) and RMSE values (Table 5) calculated between the predicted EHB and expected EHB values (as calculated from the vibrational spectra of modified base
pairs) show that all the RMSE of all the single variable models varies
between 0.4 and 0.8 kcal mol–1. As expected, the
model based on D–H distance gives the best result (RMSE = 0.41
kcal mol–1), followed by the models based on E(2) and ρ. It is important to note that the MSE and
RMSE values of these single variable models are independent of the
strength of the H-bonds (Table 5). Hence, in the worst-case scenario (EHB ≈ 2.0 kcal mol–1), the mean error
in predicting the H-bonding energies will be as high as 20%. On the
other hand, in the best-case scenario (EHB ≈ 8.0 kcal mol–1), the mean error will
be only 5%.

a For this, two topological parameters
(ρ, ∇2ρ), one charge-transfer-based
parameter (E(2)), and two geometry-based parameters
(H–A distance and D–H distance) were considered as independent
variables (x) and EHB was considered as the scalar dependent variable (y). The values for the slope (A) and y-intercept (B), along with their respective standard
deviations, are tabulated here. Units of different parameters are
as follows: EHB [kcal mol–1], ρ [a.u., 1 a.u. = ea0–3, where e is the elementary charge and a0 is the Bohr radius], ∇2ρ [a.u.,
1 a.u. = ea0–5], E(2) [kcal mol–1], H–A [Å]
and D–H [Å].

a “Weak” and “strong”
correspond to H-bonds with EHB < 4
and 15 kcal mol–1 ≥ EHB ≥ 4 kcal mol–1, respectively.

To improve the performance
of our model, we have performed multiple
linear regression analysis with the three parameters ρ, E(2), and D–H (we call it a three-parameter model)
and with all the five parameters (we call it a five-parameter model).
Using a similar least-square fit approach, we model the following
two sets of linear equations;

Three-parameter model: EHB = C0 + C1 × ρ
+ C2 × E(2) + C3 × DHNI–H···NIII: EHB = −135.1 + 11.2ρ +
0.08E(2) + 135.0DH

+ 0.05E(2) + 110.2DH

NII–H···Oc: EHB = −142.4 + 27.6ρ +
0.04E(2) + 141.7DH

Comparison of the performance
of the five-parameter model (5-P
model) and the three-parameter model (3-P model) is illustrated in Figure 4. Interestingly,
our analyses show that the performance of the three-parameter model
(RMSE = 0.55 kcal mol–1) is better than all the
single parameter models, except the D–H-based model (RMSE =
0.41 kcal mol–1). At the same time, performance
of the five-parameter model (RMSE = 0.3 kcal mol–1) is even better than that of the D-H-based single parameter model.
It is also noteworthy that the corresponding MSE and RMSE values of
the 3-P and 5-P models are dependent on the strength of the H-bonds. Table 5 shows that in comparison
to the weak H-bonds (EHB < 4 kcal mol–1), their performance is significantly better for the
moderately strong H-bonds (15 ≥ EHB ≥ 4 kcal mol–1). Therefore, for the worst-case
scenario (for H-bonds with EHB ≈
2 kcal mol–1), the 5-P model is expected to predict
the H-bonding energies with an average error of 17.5%. On the other
hand, for the best-case scenario (for H-bonds with EHB ≈ 8 kcal mol–1), the 5-P model
is expected to predict the H-bonding energies with an average error
of only 3.5%. Importantly, in an average case scenario (EHB ≈ 5 kcal mol–1), the 5-P model
is expected to perform reasonably well with an average error of only
6%.

Figure 4 Comparison of the three-parameter (in red circle) and five-parameter
(in blue square) models for interbase H-bonds present in modified
base pairs. The predicted values of EHB are plotted with respect to their corresponding expected values.
To illustrate the performance of the two models, the y = x straight line is shown as a reference.

We have also analyzed the performances
of these two multivariable
linear regression models for different types of H-bonds separately
(Tables S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information) and found that performances of both the models are reasonably good
(variance score or R2 > 0.9) for all
the
four types of interbase H-bonds (NI–H···NIII, NII–H···NIII, NI–H···Oc, and NII–H···Oc). Consistent with
the trends discussed above, their performances are exceptionally good
(R2 = 1) for the strongest NII–H···NIII bonds. To understand the
relative significance of the individual parameters in these two models, importance analysis(111) was carried
out. In keeping with the usual procedure,112 the importance value is estimated as the difference in the corresponding R2 values, when the corresponding variable is
replaced with its average value (see Tables S5 and S6). As expected, the distance between donor and hydrogen
atoms (D–H) turns out to be the most significant parameter
(importance ∼0.5), specially for NII–H···Oc-type H-bonds.

There are several earlier reports attempting
to express H-bonding
energies as linear functions of different individual parameters, such
as E(2), ρ, ∇2ρ, and
so forth. The novelty in our multivariable models lies in the inclusion
of additional parameters, belonging to different domains such as charge
transfer, topology, and geometry, which may be capturing additional
information regarding system properties. While the respective reliabilities
of earlier and our models can be seen in terms of the extent of correlation
between predicted values and experimental data, there are problems
when it comes to rating or comparing them. That is because none of
the earlier approaches have considered the subclassification of the
different H-bond classes, in terms of the bonding contexts of the
donor and acceptor atoms. However, despite the demonstrated reliability
of our multivariable models, caution must be exercised before applying
them universally to any system of interest. Rather, it is advisable
to validate the approach for other H-bonded systems before carrying
out any predictive applications.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we have come up with a comprehensive estimate of
the average H-bonding energies (EHB) of
different interbase hydrogen bonds that constitute the canonical and
noncanonical RNA base pairs. Depending on the chemical identity of
the H-bond donor and acceptor atoms, all these interbase hydrogen
bonds can be classified into 10 categories, out of which 2 are associated
with a small red shift (<40 cm–1) of the D–H
bond stretching and hence are not part of the detailed analysis (C–H···O
and C–H···N). EHB values for these eight types of interbase H-bonds have been calculated
from their vibrational spectra obtained from computationally expensive
Hessian calculation. The average EHB values
fall within the range of 2.5–7 kcal mol–1 and follow the order: NII–H···NIII > NII–H···Oc ≳ OII–H···NIII > NI–H···NIII ≳
Oh–H···Oc > NI–H···Oc ≳ Oh–H···Oh > NI–H···Oh.
We have studied the linear correlation of EHB with 13 other frequently used H-bond strength descriptors that can
be obtained from computationally inexpensive methods (QTAIM, NBO,
etc.). The four H-bonds, which occur exclusively within the Sugar
edge-mediated base pairs, do not show strong correlation with any
of the parameters studied in this work. For the other four interbase
H-bonds (also they are the strongest four interbase H-bonds), we have
found (a) three parameters E(2), ρ, and D–H
that belong to three different domains (charge transfer, topology,
and geometry, respectively) and display remarkably good (|r| > 0.9) linear correlation and (b) two parameters ∇2ρ and H–A that show reasonably good linear correlation
(0.9 < |r| < 0.85), especially when the dispersion
corrections are taken into consideration. Therefore, we have performed
single variable and multiple variable regression analysis to establish
linear relationships between the H-bond strength descriptors obtained
from computationally inexpensive methods with the EHB values obtained from accurate but computationally expensive
methods. We have tested the performance of our linear models over
an independent set of base pairs having modified nucleobases. We have
obtained promising results, at least with the model composed of five
parameters (the 5-P model). In an average case scenario (H-bonds with EHB ≈ 5 kcal mol–1),
it can predict the strength of an interbase H-bond with a 94% accuracy.
At the same time, in the best-case scenario (H-bonds with EHB ≈ 8 kcal mol–1),
the accuracy is as good as 96.5%. These predictive models show relatively
poor accuracy for the weak H-bonds (EHB < 4.0 kcal mol–1). In this regard, it may be
noted that depending on the chemical identity of the donor (D) and
acceptor (A) groups of a H-bond (D–H···A), the
shift in D–H symmetric stretching frequency leads to a continuum
of behavior (red shift to no shift to blue shift), where the zero
shift occurs around EHB ≤ 4.0 kcal
mol–1.100,113 Therefore, any interpretation
at this energy range is bound to be error-prone. Overall, these linear
models provide the scope to calculate the EHB values of any individual interbase H-bond.

We expect that
our efforts will be useful in exploring the intriguing
world of H-bonding as our predictive models provide reliable estimates
for H-bond strengths with computationally inexpensive calculations.
On the other hand, our analysis of the strengths of individual interbase
H-bonds provides effective inputs for designing coarse-grain-based
force fields for RNA and other nucleic acid-based systems. These consolidated
information are also helpful in analyzing the trajectories obtained
from molecular dynamics simulations of DNA/RNA and similar systems.
