mesoporous cross-linked poly(vinyl imidazole)s
with sulfonic acid tags, [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1)
and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2), were prepared
and characterized by a variety of techniques such as Fourier transform

energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy,
thermal gravimetry, derivative thermal gravimetry, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller).
In addition, magnetic properties of poly(vinyl imidazole) sulfonic

catalysts for the preparation of N-heterocycle spiropyrans. The described
catalysts were recycled and reused with a marginal decrease in their
catalytic activities. The desired products were prepared under mild

Introduction
Polymers and biopolymers represent an
attractive research field
for academic and industrial processes. Polymers including cations
such as imidazolium, pyrrolidonium, and pyridinium and anions such
as tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate, and triflates are called
polymeric ionic liquids (PILs).1−3 In recent years, polymeric ionic
liquids (PILs) have become valuable materials because of their applications
such as in catalysis, biotechnology, materials science, analytical
chemistry, desulfurization of fuels (as extactants), and energy and
environmental applications.4−6 Without any doubt, one of the
main applications of polymers and biopolymers as catalysts has advantages
due to their nanoporous structures, high surface area, and thermal
stability.7 As a result of the great development
made in this field, nanomagnetic properties of polymeric ionic liquids
(PILs) can be modified via a task-specific choice of suitable linkers.
Recently, an anion-exchange method has been used as a fantastic procedure
for the development of ionic liquids (ILs) or molten salts (MSs).
Ionic liquids which have the potential for designing and synthesis
of various ILs and MSs are those functionalized with N-sulfonic acid(s).8 To the best of our
knowledge, ILs and MSs are designable because by applying the ion-exchange
method, we can prepare ILs and MSs with excellent diversity and physical
and chemical properties.9−12 Mesoporous polymer frameworks have been used as catalysts
and for gas storage and separation purposes.13 Hamaguchi and other research groups reported magnetic ionic liquids,
which are easily extruded from the reaction mixture using a magnet.14−16 A variety of materials have been used for the design and synthesis
of catalysts, which have revealed various catalytic and chemical properties.
These materials as dual-role catalysts with both Brønsted and
Lewis acidic properties have high catalytic abilities.17−21

Molecules with indole and uracil moieties are of great interest
due to their biological and pharmacological activities.22,23 Spiropyrans have also attracted much attention because of their
application within perovskite solar cells19 and pharmacological properties, e.g., as inhibitors of the human
NK-1 receptor and antitumoral, antimicrobial, and antibiotic agents.20 Moreover, polyhydroquinoline and/or 1,4-dihydropyridine
structures are the building blocks of many natural, medicinal, and
pharmacological molecular structures.24−26 For example, antimalarial,
spirotryprosatin B aspergillus fumigatus and horsfilline are examples
of natural products that have the above-said moieties within their
structures (Figure 1). Lately, several methods and catalysts such as PEG-OSO3H,27 SBA-15-PhSO3H,28 Ag NPs,29 MSAIL,30p-TSA,31 organometallics (zinc, copper, palladium, scandium, iridium, nickel,
gold, silver, and rhodium catalyzed), organocatalysts,32 Fe2O3@SiO2@vitB1-Np,33 and rhodium34 have been reported for the synthesis of spiropyrans. The
above-mentioned reported methodologies suffer from some disadvantages
such as long reaction time, low yield, nonrecoverable catalysts, etc.

and horsfilline in natural products.

Recently, we have reported a wide range of imidazolium- and pyridinium-based
ILs and MSs functionalized with N-sulfonic acid tags
for preparing heterocyclic compounds, energetic materials, and nitro
compounds.35−40 As a continuation of our previous investigation on the synthesis
and applications of organic salts (ILs and MSs), herein, the synthesis
of two novel nano-heterogeneous cross-linked and mesoporous ionically
tagged polymers [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) are reported (Scheme 1). The synthesized
polymers were fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy, thermal gravimetry (TG), derivative thermal gravimetry
(DTG), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), SEM-elemental mapping,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller,
BET), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Both [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) were successfully used as catalysts for producing a range
of N-heterocycle spiropyrans via a multicomponent reaction of various
carbonyl compounds (A), amino compounds (B), and nucleophilic compounds (C) under refluxing water
conditions (Scheme 2).

Results
and Discussion
Organic and inorganic resins are attractive
beds for supporting
activators and promoters for preparing heterogeneous catalysts and/or
reagents. We have used silica and silica-coated F3O4 for this purpose in the present decade. Among our reported
catalysts and/or reagents, silica sulfuric acid as a multipurpose
catalyst has been extensively used.41,42 Herein, we
decided to synthesis an organic polymer with sulfonic acid tags. With
this aim, initially, we synthesized poly(vinyl imidazole) (PVI) via
a reaction of 1-vinyl-1H-imidazole and ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate (EDGMA) according to the reported procedure with a
slight modification. Then, poly(vinyl imidazole) sulfonic acid chloride
[PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and poly(vinyl imidazole)
sulfonic acid iron(IV) chloride [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) were prepared as ionically tagged polymers in two
steps by an anion-exchange method. We designed and synthesized [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) as a dual-role catalyst
due to the presence of Lewis and Brønsted acidic tags within
the structure of the polymer. The mentioned polymers, [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2), were fully characterized by applying FT-IR spectroscopy,
XRD, TG, DTG, EDX analysis, VSM, SEM, and TEM analysis (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Preparation of Poly(vinyl
imidazole) Sulfonic Acid Chloride [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2)
The FT-IR spectra of poly(vinyl imidazole) (PVI)
and ionically
tagged polymers [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) are compared in Figure 2. The FT-IR spectrum
of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) showed a broad peak of O–H
stretching related to the SO3H group at 3000–3500
cm–1, and the peaks observed at 1201–1056
cm–1 were attributed to stretching O–S and
N–S, respectively.43,44 Furthermore, the peak
at 1740 cm–1 was related to the stretching C=O
bond (Figure 2).

of poly(vinyl imidazole) (PVI) and ionically tagged
polymers [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2).

The elements in the structure of poly(vinyl imidazole) (PVI), [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1), and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) were studied by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
(Figure 3). The obtained
results were approved due to the presence of expected elements such
as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and chlorine for [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur,
chlorine, and iron for [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) in comparison with carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in poly(vinyl
imidazole) (PVI). Then, SEM-elemental mapping of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) (C, N, O, S, and Cl) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) (C, N, O, S, Cl, and Fe) in the
desired polymeric catalysts verified well-dispersed elements over
the catalyst surface (Figure 4).

(green) atoms for [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2).

The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) micrographs of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and
[PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) were also studied.
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, particles of the catalysts are in
the nanoscale which are in a
good agreement and are not completely agglomerated.

To investigate the structure of poly(vinyl imidazole) sulfonic
acid chloride [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) is an efficient technique, which could provide
information about the size and morphology of particles. The TEM images
of the catalysts were shown to match well with those of the nanostructured
cross-linked polymers. Based on these images, the average size of
channels is mainly around 50 nm (Figure 7).

of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1).

In another investigation, magnetic properties of poly(vinyl imidazole)
sulfonic acid iron(IV) chloride [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) were investigated at room temperature using a vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM), as shown in Figure 8. Based on the magnetization curves, the
saturation of the obtained catalyst dropped from 3.2 emu/g. Therefore,
it has weak magnetic properties.

results of [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2).

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
for poly(vinyl
imidazole) (PVI) and its sulfonate form [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) are presented in Figure 9. Both adsorption isotherms are type III, indicating
a weak interaction of N2 with the samples for both systems.
Hysteresis loops were observed, which indicate the presence of mesopores.
The pore size distribution of both samples is presented in Figure 9. Pore sizes are
mainly between 1 and 50 nm for PVI and 10 and 30 nm for [PVI- SO3H]Cl (1), indicating that most of the pores are
mesopores and by sulfonation the pore size range decreased. The mean
pore diameter for PVI is 20.6 nm and for [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) is 11.0 nm. The obtained total pore volumes of PVI and
[PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) are 0.2102 and 0.0048 cm3/g, respectively. Calculated BET surface areas for PVI and
[PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) are 40.3 and 1.8 m2/g, respectively. All of the structural data obtained based on N2 adsorption–desorption indicate that by sulfonation
of PVI most of its pores were blocked, and therefore, the total pore
volume and also the surface area decreased.

In another investigation,
thermal and behavioral stability of ionically
tagged polymers [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) was studied
using thermal gravimetry (TG), derivative thermal gravimetry (DTG),
and differential thermal analysis (DTA) (Figure 10). The first step is the weight loss, happening
between 25 and 100 °C, associated with the removal of possible
solvents (organic and water) used in the course of preparation of
target catalysts. The main stage of weight loss was related to SO3H release due to the breaking of the N–S bond structure
of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2). Therefore, degradation of the
structures of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) happened after 350 °C
and gave rise to about 50% weight loss. Thus, these catalysts can
be used up to 350 °C.

gravimetric (DTG)
profiles of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2).

After the synthesis and characterization of [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) as catalysts, they were used for the synthesis of N-heterocycle
spiropyrans. The mentioned N-heterocycle spiropyran derivatives were
synthesized via the one-pot reaction of carbonyl compounds A (isatin derivatives, acenaphthylene-1,2-dione, or 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one) (1 mmol), compounds B (uracil derivatives, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine, or benzamide) (1 mmol), and compounds C (dimedone, 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile,
or phenol) (1 mmol) in the presence of [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) or [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) separately. The condensation of 2,6-diaminopyrimidin-4(3H)-one (1 mmol, 0.126 g), isatin (1 mmol, 0.147 g), and
dimedone (1 mmol, 0.14 g) was selected as the model reaction to optimize
the reaction conditions. As shown in Table 1, noteworthy results were obtained when the
reaction was conducted in the presence of 0.01 g of 1 or 2 (Table 1, entry 1). No improvement was detected in the yield of reaction
using different amounts of the catalyst and temperature (Table 1 entries 2–7). Table 1 clearly shows that
in the absence of the catalyst the product was produced in a low yield
(entry 8). To investigate the solvent effect on the reaction improvement,
several solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), EtOH, CH2Cl2, EtOAc, CH3CN, n-hexane,
CHCl3, toluene, and MeOH (10 mL) and solvent free conditions
were tested and compared with H2O in the presence of 0.01
g of 1 or 2 (Table 1, entries 9–18). The results are summarized
in Table 1.

(1 mmol, 0.14 g). 1: [PVI-SO3H]Cl; 2: [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4.

As a continuation of our investigations on the use
of [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1), the efficiency and applicability were
studied
by the reaction of carbonyl compounds A (isatin derivatives,
acenaphthylene-1,2-dione, or 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one) (1 mmol), compounds B (uracil
derivatives, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine,
or benzamide) (1 mmol), and compounds C (dimedone, 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile or phenol) (1 mmol). As
exposed in Table 2,
the results show that this method is suitable for the synthesis of
N-heterocycle spiropyran derivatives such as spiro[indoline-3,5′-pyrimido[4,5-b]quinoline]-triones (1a–17a), 6′-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3′-methyl-2-oxo-1′-phenyl-1′,7′-dihydrospiro[indoline-3,4′-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine]-5′-carbonitrile (1b–2b), and N-(3-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-yl)benzamide
(1c–2c) in high to excellent yields
(40–92%) with in relatively short reaction times (1–5
h).

Derivatives Using [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) or [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) at 90 °C
The efficiency of the described catalysts,
[PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1), was compared for the synthesis of 2′-amino-8′,8′-dimethyl-8′,9′-dihydro-3′H-spiro[indoline-3,5′-pyrimido[4,5-b]quinoline]-2,4′,6′(7′H,10′H)-trione by the reaction of 2,6-diaminopyrimidin-4(3H)-one (1 mmol, 0.126 g), isatin (1 mmol, 0.147 g), and
dimedone (1 mmol, 0.14 g) under the above-mentioned optimized reaction
conditions. Various organic and inorganic acid catalysts were also
tested for the above-said reaction (Table 3). The individual role of Brønsted (SO3H) and Lewis (Fe3+) acidic sites was also studied
on a model reaction in percent of PVI + FeCl3, PVI, and
FeCl3, respectively (entries 18–20, Table 3). The applied PVI+FeCl3, PVI, and FeCl3 as catalysts could not be recycled
and gave the products with low yield and high reaction times.45,46 As Table 3 indicates,
[PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) are the best choice for the synthesis
of N-heterocycle spiropyran derivatives due to the shorter reaction
times, higher yields, and lowest amounts of the applied catalyst.

The proposed mechanism for the synthesis of N-heterocycle
spiropyrans
is indicated in Scheme 4. First, the acidic groups (SO3H) of [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) or [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) activate the carbonyl group of isatin, and 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds (C) are enolized. Then, the reaction of 1,3-dicarbonyl
compounds (C) with isatin leads to a removal of one molecule
of H2O to give intermediate I. In the next
step, compound B as a nucleophile attacks intermediate
(I), which acts as a Michael acceptor, to give II. Finally, the cyclocondensation reaction of II affords III, which is converted into the corresponding
N-heterocycle spiropyran derivatives.

Scheme 4 Suggested Mechanism
for the Synthesis of N-Heterocycle Spiropyrans
Catalyzed by 1 and 2
According to the results in Figure 11, the recyclability and reuse of the presented
catalysts [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and
[PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) were also studied on a model
reaction of 2,6-diaminopyrimidin-4(3H)-one (1 mmol,
0.126 g), isatin (1 mmol, 0.147 g), and dimedone (1 mmol, 0.14 g)
under the above-mentioned optimized reaction conditions. The applied
[PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) could be recycled (see the Experimental Section for details) and efficiently
reused up to five and six reaction cycles with a marginal decrease
in their catalytic activities. [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) and [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) were
also characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure 12) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
(Figures 13 and 14) after their application in the model reaction.
The spectra were the same as those of the fresh catalyst.

Conclusions
In conclusion, novel nanostructured and cross-linked poly(vinyl
imidazole)s with sulfonic acid tags [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) and [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) were synthesized. The synthesized [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) acts as a dual-role catalyst due to the
presence of Lewis and Brønsted acidic tags (SO3H and
Fe3+ moieties) within the structure of the polymer. The
structures of the mentioned polymers were fully characterized by using
various techniques. These catalysts were successfully applied in the
multicomponent synthesis of target N-heterocycle spiropyrans by a
condensation reaction of their corresponding reactants. Short reaction
times, a clean reaction profile, recyclability of catalysts, and mild
and green reaction conditions are the major advantages of the described
methodology.

Experimental Section
Materials and Apparatus
All of the chemicals were purchased
from Merck Chemical Company. The known products were identified by
comparison of their melting points and spectral data with those reported
in the literature. The progress of the reactions was monitored by
TLC using silica gel SIL G/UV 254 plates. Melting points were recorded
on a Büchi B-545 apparatus in open capillary tubes. Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the derivatives and catalysts
were recorded on an FT-IR spectrometer (PerkinElmer Spectrum 65 or
JASCO FT/IR4100LE) using KBr disks. The 1H NMR (400 MHz)
and 13C NMR (101 MHz) experiments were run on BRUKER BioSpin
GmbH spectrometers (δ in ppm). The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) study was performed using a MIRA3 TESCAN. Thermogravimetric
analyses were carried out on a TA (models Q600) under a nitrogen atmosphere
at 25 °C and a heating rate of 20 °C/min up to 700 °C.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using
an Agar Scientific. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
method was used to calculate the specific surface areas (SBET). By using the BELSORP MINI II (BJH) model, the pore
volumes and pore size distributions were derived from the adsorption
branches of isotherms.

Preparation of Poly(vinyl imidazole) (PVI)
In a 25
mL round-bottom flask, a mixture of 1-vinyl-1H-imidazole
(11 mmol, 1.034 g, 1 mL), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDGMA) (15
mmol, 2.97 g, 3 mL), and azobisisobutyronitrile (0.18 mmol, 30 mg)
with H2O (20 mL) as the solvent was stirred for 4 h under
reflux conditions.49,50 Afterward, the residue was washed
with H2O (2 × 15 mL) and dried under powerful vacuum
at 90 °C to give poly(vinyl imidazole) (PVI) as a white precipitate
in 95% (9 g) yield (Scheme 3).

and chlorosulfonic acid (1 mmol, 0.067 mL) in dry CH2Cl2 at 0 °C was stirred for 2 h. Afterward, a white precipitate
appeared, which was filtered and dried under vacuum to obtain [PVI-SO3H]Cl (2) (Scheme 3).

Preparation of Poly(vinyl imidazole) Sulfonic
Acid Iron(IV)
Chloride [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2)
In an oven, a mixture of poly(vinyl imidazole) sulfonic acid chloride
[PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) (1 mmol, 0.398 g) and FeCl3 salt (1 mmol, 0.162 g) was placed at 60 °C for 2 h into
a mortar and stirred with a pestle. After completion of the reaction,
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then, ethanol
was used to purify the poly(vinyl imidazole) sulfonic acid iron(IV)
chloride [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2). The
desired [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) was
obtained with a yield of 94% (0.52 g) (Scheme 3).

Preparation of N-Heterocycle Spiropyrans
Using [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) or [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2)
In a 25 mL round-bottom
flask, a mixture of carbonyl
compounds A (isatin derivatives, acenaphthylene-1,2-dione,
or 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one)
(1 mmol), compounds B (uracil derivatives, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine, or benzamide) (1 mmol), compounds C (dimedone, 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile,
or phenol) (1 mmol), [PVI-SO3H]Cl (1) or [PVI-SO3H]FeCl4 (2) (0.01 g), and H2O (10 mL) was added and fitted with a reflux condenser. The TLC technique
was used for monitoring the progress and completion of the reaction,
and the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The solvent
of the reaction mixture was removed by simple filtration. Then, the
residue was extracted with PEG (10 mL), and the catalyst was recovered
by centrifugation (2 × 1000 rpm). The desired products were washed
with water/ethanol and collected by simple filtration (Scheme 2).
