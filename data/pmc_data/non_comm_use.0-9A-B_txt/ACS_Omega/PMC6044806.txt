Cesium–gold
(Cs–Au) nanoparticles are shown to be
analytically advantageous for the electroanalytical sensing of dapoxetine
(DPX), a serotonin reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of premature
ejaculation. The Cs–Au nanoparticles are electrically wired
and supported upon mass producible, economical screen-printed electrochemical
sensing platforms and are characterized electrochemically (cyclic
voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and physiochemically
(field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive
X-ray analysis). The face-centered design was applied to optimize
the significant experimental factors by using square wave voltammetry.
The Cs–Au-based sensor is found to exhibit a large linear range
(10–7 to 10–4 M) with a good analytical
linearity with the limits of detection and quantification corresponding
to 2.50 × 10–10 and 8.33 × 10–8 M, respectively. The developed sensor was successfully applied in
the quantification of DPX in the presence of sildenafil, both of which
are commonly found within combined dose tablet pharmaceutical formulations.
The proposed DPX electrochemical Cs–Au-based sensor has the
advantages of being single-shot and disposable and is shown to be
successful in determining DPX in pharmaceutical formulations, human
urine, and serum samples with acceptable recoveries.

Introduction
The World Health Organization
has defined premature ejaculation
(PE) as “persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal
stimulation before or shortly after penetration and before the person
wishes it, over which the sufferer has little or no voluntary control,
which causes the sufferer and/or his partner bother or distress.”1,2 PE prevails in over 20–30% of men,3 and its probability is high in young adults and
adolescents.4 Dapoxetine (DPX), [(S)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(naphthalene-1-yloxy)-1-phenylpropan-1-amine]
is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)5 and was the first drug approved in 2008 for PE treatment
in seven European countries.5,6 Henceforth, DPX has
established marketing approval in 59 countries worldwide. Its safety
and efficacy has also been substantiated by an extensive clinical
development program of PE treatment.5,7 Erectile dysfunction
(ED) is another male-associated sexual problem that is common in the
elderly.8 The normal erectile function
may be impaired due to several physical or psychological factors.
Typical medications for ED9 promote penile
blood flow, and enhance erectile function.6 Combinations of SSRI and PDE-5 inhibitors are common in many sexual
health medications, in particular for PE.10,11

Regrettably, some of these medications may contain incorrect
doses,
and moreover, many health supplements contain undeclared agents. Food
Drug Administration listed 355 undeclared sexual enhancement products,
with ∼8% of them containing undeclared DPX and other PDE-5
inhibitors.12 This underlying problem has
a detrimental effect on the general health care. Mild dizziness to
serious death has been encountered as adverse effects of these counterfeit
medications.13 The widespread availability
of male sexual enhancers is a matter of concern.14,15 Hence, Lebel et al.16 developed a fast
screening liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) methodology
for the simultaneous identification of 71 ED active ingredients and
11 natural ingredients present in counterfeited trademark products.16 Another study reported the high-performance
liquid chromatography isolation of DPX from a health supplement powder
sold in Singapore, along with structural elucidation using nuclear
magnetic resonance, infrared, high-resolution MS, and electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry.17

Chromatographic
methods have been reported for the analysis of
DPX using either ultraviolet18−29 or fluorescence detection30 as well as
capillary electrophoresis.31 Ultraperformance
liquid chromatography-MS/MS has also been reported for the quantification
of DPX in biological fluids.5,32 Obviously, all these
reported instrumental techniques are costly and demand professional
training; analytically useful alternatives are sought after.

Electrochemical methods of analysis have shown to be accurate,
sensitive, and cost-effective33 and can
be applied for the determination of different analytes such as new
psychoactive substances,34 proteins,35 and opioid drugs.36,37 Simple, rapid,
inexpensive, and accurate testing devices should be made available
to meet patients’ convenience along with industrial needs.
In this regard, screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) have been widely
used for point-of-care testing applications with the aim of satisfying
inexpert users.38 SPEs have the benefits
of being cost-effective (due to having scales of economy), portability,
provide useful analytical outputs and can be easily integrated within
portable systems for on-site detection analysis. Furthermore, SPEs
can be rapidly modified with nanomaterials to provide further enhancements
in sensing performance toward target analytes, which improve electrochemical
activity and hence analytical performances.39,40 To this end, we have electrochemically modified SPEs and tailored
the electrode surface to provide a nanoparticle-modified sensor for
the sensing of DPX. From this perspective, we have utilized Au–Cs
nanoparticle-modified SPEs to devise a new platform for the sensing
of DPX. This sensor is based on the electrochemical codeposition of
Au and Cs nanoparticles onto the surface of SPEs. Note that to the
best of our knowledge, no dynamic electrochemical approaches have
been reported to date for the sensing of DPX, but potentiometric sensing
has been reported.41 The potential sensor
was used for the analysis of DPX alone and in the presence of coformulated drug SIL simultaneously.
The proposed electroanalytical methodology was fully validated according
to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines with
further selectivity assessment in the presence of SIL as a coformulated
PDE-5 inhibitor within pharmaceutical and biological samples.

Results
and Discussion
The electrochemical response of the Cs–Au/SPE
was explored
to evaluate its potential as the basis of a DPX sensor. The cyclic
voltammetric response of the Cs–Au/SPE was explored toward
the electrochemical oxidation of DPX and compared to Au/SPE, Cs/SPE,
and a metallic-free unmodified SPE. Figure 1 depicts large and quantifiable electrochemical
signatures in all cases. The Cs–Au/SPE exhibits the highest
voltammetric signal (67.8 μA/+1.23 V) analytical response at
the lowest (see Experimental Section), and
we surmise that upon the anodic scan, the Cs–Au nanoparticles
are not stripped off the electrode surface, allowing the electrochemical
oxidation of DPX to occur. In the case of the Au/SPE and Cs/SPE, this
is not the situation, and the corresponding electrochemical oxidation
peaks of DPX are lower. Hence, the Cs–Au nanoparticles exhibit
a beneficial synergistic effect. The Supporting Information provides further information on the characterization
of the electrode surfaces and determination of the electrochemical
active areas. The electrochemical properties of the potential sensor
were further corroborated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS). Figure S1 displays the EIS response
for the bare SPE, Cs/SPE, Au/SPE, and Cs–Au/SPE, where the
bare SPE gives rise to a large semicircle domain, indicating a high
electron transfer resistance. Upon modifying the SPE with Cs or Au, RCT exhibits a small semicircle domain, indicating
enhanced electrical conductivity. In the case of the Cs–Au/SPE, RCT decreases, indicating an increase in the
electron-transfer kinetics. In summary, the electron-transfer resistance
decreases in the following order: bare SPE < Cs/SPE < Au/SPE
< Cs–Au/SPE, which confirms the observations reported above
(Figure 1), indicating
that the combination of Au and Cs exhibits an excellent electrically
conducting material.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms of 1.0 mM DPX in the B–R buffer
(pH
2.0) at a scan rate of 0.10 V s–1 recorded using
SPE, Cs/SPE, Au/SPE, and Cs–Au/SPE.

Next, the effect of changing the solution pH upon the electrochemical
oxidation of DPX using the Cs–Au/SPE was explored over the
pH range of 2.0–7.0. As shown in Figure S4, the peak potentials (Ep) voltammetrically
shift toward a less positive potential upon increasing the pH value
from 2.0 to 7.0, which can be attributed to the protonation/deprotonation
of DPX. Figure S4 reveals the relationships
of the peak current and peak potential with the solution pH, where
the peak current decreases with increasing pH; based upon this data,
pH 2 Britton–Robinson (B–R) buffer was selected as the
optimum pH for further studies. Analysis of the voltammetric responses
(peak potential, Ep) displays a linear
relationship with pH of the buffer solution, which can be fitted as Ep (V) = 1.35 V – 52.4 mV pH–1; coefficient of determination R2 = 0.9997;
the value of 52.4 mV/pH is close to the theoretical value expected
for an equal electron and proton process. As depicted in Figure S4, a well-developed anodic peak current
was shown over the pH range from 2.0 to 7.0. However, a small-developed
second peak starts to appear, which increases steadily with increasing
pH. Furthermore, on increasing the pH value up to 7.0, the first oxidation
peak is observed to shift to a less-positive potential, indicating
the irreversible behavior of the oxidation process, which is confirmed
by the cyclic voltammetric analysis (see Figure 1). The corresponding peak decreases because
of the hindrance of the oxidation process due to the reduced concentration
of protons and strong adsorption of the oxidative products of DPX
upon the electrode surface. This suggests that the H+ ions
were involved in the oxidation of the DPX molecule, and the deprotonation
step proceeds before the electron-transfer step. The plot of the first
peak potential versus pH exhibits a straight line between 2.0 and
7.0. From the inspection of the molecular structure of DPX, it can
be seen that the anodic peak is likely because of the hydroxylation
of the benzene ring, as reported previously using mercury, boron-doped
diamond, and glassy carbon electrodes.42,43 DPX has two
suggested oxidation mechanism pathways. In acidic media, from pH 2
→ 4, one anodic peak appears. This peak is likely because of
the hydroxylation of the benzene ring.44 At pH values 5.0 and above, another anodic peak starts to appear
as the DPX gives two separate anodic oxidation peaks. The second anodic
peak appears likely because of the deprotonation of DPX and the formation
of a cation radical via the loss of a proton and an electron. This
second oxidation process appears in neutral and alkaline media because
of the oxidation of the secondary amine group.44 The decrease in the anodic signal (peak current) is observed
because of the appearance of the second oxidation step occurring at
less positive potentials. Moreover, the anodic peak current of the
first peak reaches its highest value at pH 2.0 in the form of a sharp
peak and was recorded as a single response in acidic media. On the
basis of the above data, pH 2.0 was selected for further electrochemical
measurements. Nyquist plots for the Cs–Au/SPE at different
pH values are shown in Figure S4B. The
semicircle diameter and the impedance values increase with increasing
pH, indicating a decrease in the conductivity and giving the same
order of the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results.

Next, the effect
of varying the voltammetric scan rate upon the
electrochemical oxidation of DPX was investigated using CV, as shown
in Figure S5. The Cs–Au/SPE displays
a linear relationship between the voltammetric current (Ip) and the square root of the scan rate (v1/2), as shown in Figure S5 (inset A), suggesting that the electrochemical process is diffusion-controlled.
The data can be fitted as Ip (μA)
= −1.644 + 6.648v (V s–1)−1/2 with a correlation coefficient of 0.9993.
The electrochemical oxidation peak potential (Ep) is also dependent upon the voltammetric scan rate, where
increasing the scan rate results in a shift to more positive potentials;
the linear relationship between Ep and
log v can be described as Ep (mV) = 491E (mV) + 155.2 (mV s–1) (R2 = 0.9998). Using the Laviron45 equation for an irreversible electrochemical
process, the electrochemical parameters of the electrochemical oxidation
of DPX using the Cs–Au/SPE are found to be as follows: αn = 0.44, α = 0.44, Eo′ = 1.20, and ko = 26.9 s–1. On the basis of the results obtained from the voltammetric experiments,
the number of electrons transferred (n) in the electrochemical
process was calculated and found to be one, which is in agreement
with the results obtained from the effect of pH described above.

Design of experiments for optimization is a beneficial technique
to extract the effects of factors upon certain responses. As a common
mathematical model for the prediction of factors affecting an analytical
response, that is, in this case the peak current, the response surface
method (RSM) was applied, which is an efficient optimization procedure
that saves both cost and time.46,47 The RSM has the ability
to estimate a second-order prediction formula along with interaction
effects. However, it requires a large number of experiments in numerous
factor designs. Therefore, factors should be limited in the first
instance to apply the RSM. Screening for influential factors such
as pH, scan rate, along with deposition voltage and time was experimentally
conducted beforehand. This study revealed that the scan rate, deposition
time, and pH substantially affect the signal/current. A face-centered
design was applied, which is a special type of central composite design
for RSM optimization. Sixteen experiments were conducted in random
order, including eight experiments at the vertices of the cube (code:
+ or −), six experiments on face axial points (i.e., axial
value = 1; code: a or A), and a center point (code: 0) repeated two
times to improve the mathematical prediction model (Table 1).

The mathematical prediction model for the current (I) was calculated from the linear, quadratic, and interaction terms
as follows  where X1, X2, and X3 are the
scan rate, the deposition time and pH, respectively. The coefficient
of determination (R2) of the model was
found to correspond to 0.92 with the root mean square error found
to be 4.67, indicating an adequate fit of the prediction model. Comparing
the coefficients of the main effects, we can conclude that the scan
rate has the largest significant positive effect (p = 0.0007), and hence response would be maximized at a high level
of this factor (50 mV/s). Another significant main effect is the deposition
time (p = 0.0032), the large positive coefficient
of X2 provides that the long deposition
time is favored. The last insignificant main factor is pH with a negative
coefficient that in turn increases the design’s target at its
low level. All coefficients of quadratic terms are too small to be
significant as noticed response surface curvatures in Figure 2. Note that the positive quadratic
terms were registered for the scan rate and pH, whereas a negative
one was present for the deposition time. Therefore, opposite curvatures
of contour lines were noticed in the deposition time response function
with other factors (Figure 2A,C). Trivial interaction between the studied factors was
also calculated in the prediction model, however, the largest coefficient
of X1X3 indicates
a possible interaction between the scan rate and pH, as observed in
the contour line curvature in Figure 2B. The final optimization suggested that using a scan
rate of 50 mV/s and deposition time of 80 s at pH 2.0 would maximize
the obtained current.

parameters: (A) scan rate/deposition time, (B) pH/scan rate, and (C)
deposition time/pH upon the voltammetric current/analytical signal.

The proposed Cs–Au/SPE-based
sensor was next investigated
through exploring the simultaneous detection of DPX and SIL. The optimized
conditions for DPX determination via square wave voltammetry (SWV,
pH 2.0, scan rate: 0.05 V s–1, and 80 s for deposition)
were used. The ICH guidelines48,49 for method validation
were followed for validation of this suggested method. SWV experiments
were performed using the Cs–Au/SPE sensor in pH 2.0 B–R
buffer solution containing various individual concentrations of DPX.
The calibration range used was chosen based upon the likely practical
range that DPX concentrations will be encountered within real samples.
The SWV results are presented in Figure 3 with the corresponding calibration plot
(inset of Figure 3).
The results show the peak currents corresponding to the electrochemical
oxidation of DPX using the Cs–Au/SPE, which is found to be
linearly dependent on DPX concentrations over the range of 1.0 ×
10–7 to 1.0 × 10–4 M [Ip (μA) = 0.147C (μM)
+ 2.104; R2 = 0.9995]. The calculated
limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) were
found to be 2.5 × 10–8 and 8.3 × 10–8 M, respectively. Note that this is the first voltammetric
approach, and previously only ion-selective electrodes were reported
with a linear range of 1.0 × 10–4 to 1.0 ×
10–2 M, and the LOD was reported to be 2.0 ×
10–5 M,41 indicating
that the Cs–Au/SPE is analytically advantageous. The stability
of the Cs–Au/SPE was also explored, where the voltammetric
peak current was found not to change following storage in air for
7 days; the sensor was found to retain 98.94–99.07% of its
initial response. Furthermore, Figure 3B depicts the square wave voltammograms for an array
of varying concentrations of SIL over the range of 2.5 × 10–8 to 5.0 × 10–5 M [Ip (μA) = 0.257C (μM) + 1.102; R2 = 0.9991]. The calculated values of LOD and
LOQ were found to be 5.84 × 10–9 and 1.95 ×
10–8, respectively. The repeatability and intermediate
precisions were found to correspond to 0.891–0.902% and 0.957–1.08%
for DPX and SIL, respectively.

Figure 3 Square wave voltammograms using the Cs–Au/SPE
sensors recorded
in pH 2.0 B–R buffer corresponding to (A) 1.0 × 10–7 to 1.1 × 10–3 M DPX and (B)
5.0 × 10–8 to 1.1 × 10–3 SIL. (C) Square wave voltammograms of 6.6 × 10–7 to 1.0 × 10–4 M DPX in the presence of 5.0
× 10–8 to 6.0 × 10–5 M SIL at a scan rate of 0.05 V s–1 and their corresponding
calibration curves.

The specificity of the
Cs–Au/SPE was next explored with
its electroanalytical response examined toward the sensing of DPX
in the presence of the frequently coformulated drug SIL. This was
performed by simultaneously changing the concentrations of these drugs
and recording the square wave voltammograms on the Cs–Au/SPE. Figure 3C shows the voltammetric
response of using the Cs–Au/SPE sensor toward the sensing of
DPX in the presence of SIL. The results showed well-defined anodic
peaks at potentials of +1.2 and +1.4 V, corresponding to the oxidation
of DPX and SIL, respectively, demonstrating that the simultaneous
determination of DPX and SIL is feasible. The calibration plots (inset
of Figure 3) are found
to be linearly related to the concentrations of DPX and SIL over the
ranges 6.6 × 10–7 to 1.0 × 10–4 and 5.0 × 10–8 to 6.0 × 10–8 M, respectively. The regression equations were Ip (μA) = 0.140C (μM) + 0.910, R2 = 0.9991 and Ip (μA) = 0.234C (μM) + 0.931, R2 = 0.9990 for DPX and SIL, respectively. The
electroanalytical sensitivities of the Cs–Au/SPE sensor toward
the oxidation of DPX and SIL were found to be 0.140 and 0.234 μA/μM,
respectively; these values are very close to the value obtained for
the independent determination of DPX and SIL (0.147 and 0.257 μA/μM),
demonstrating that the simultaneous determination of DPX and SIL is
possible with useful analytical capabilities and sensitivities.

The presence of ascorbic acid (ASA) and uric acid (UA) were also
explored upon the electrochemical oxidation of DPX (Figure S6) because these two analytes coexist in many biological
samples.50 The electrochemical oxidation
of 6.5 × 10–6 M DPX in the presence of 6.5
× 10–6 M ASA and UA were investigated using
the Cs–Au/SPE via SWV, as shown in Figure S6, which demonstrates that these are far resolved from the
analytical peak of interest. The effect of many substances that can
potentially interfere with the electroanalytical determination of
DPX were also examined. A range of potential interferences were chosen,
which are commonly found in pharmaceutical formulations. Using a fixed
DPX concentration of 6.5 × 10–6 M in pH 2.0
B–R buffer solution, each of these substances was added, and
the magnitude of the DPX signal was monitored. From the chosen potential
interfering substances, none were found to interfere with the electroanalytical
sensing of DPX, and the tolerance limit was less than ±4% for
each of the interference substances. The results showed that 100-fold
of sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose, and citric acid and 200-fold
of potassium sorbate, stearic acid, talc powder, magnesium stearate,
povidone, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, cellulose, colloidal
silicon dioxide, and croscarmellose sodium did not affect the selectivity.

Calibration curves for the spiked plasma and urine were also constructed.
The obtained regression equation and related validation parameters
are reported in Table S1. The determination
of DPX and SIL in the spiked blood plasma, urine, and the pharmaceutical
sample (Joypox) tablets was done using the Cs–Au/SPE sensors
(Table 2). The above
analytical results indicate that the Cs–Au/SPE is a highly
accurate and sensitive sensor, which has further benefits of not requiring
any intricate sample pretreatment and has potential as an analytical
methodology for the determination of DPX and SIL in real samples.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported for the first
time, the electroanalytical
sensing of DPX using a Au–Cs nanoparticle-based sensor. This
Cs–Au/SPE sensor exhibits low LOD and LOQ with a wide linear
range and is shown to determine DPX in the existence of the frequently
coformulated drug SIL without any interference. The Cs–Au/SPE
sensor has been successfully applied for the determination of DPX
within pharmaceutical samples and human plasma with satisfactory recoveries.
In comparison of this proposed sensor to other analytical technologies
such as chromatographic methods, the developed sensor is cost-effective,
fast, potentially portable, and uses simpler instruments; and because
of the outstanding analytical features of the sensor, the proposed
sensor has the potential to be routinely used in the determination
of DPX in biological samples.

Experimental Section
Materials and Reagents
DPX and SIL were kindly supplied
by Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Alexandria, Egypt with a purity of 99.12
and 99.78%, respectively; Joypox tablets, labeled to contain 60 mg
DPX per tablet, were purchased from a local pharmaceutical supplier
(shop). B–R buffer (4.0 × 10–2 M) was
prepared by mixing H3PO4, acetic acid, and boric
acid with the appropriate amount of 0.2 M NaOH to obtain the desired
pH (2.0–7.0). Hydrogen-tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4), potassium permanganate, and sodium nitrate were purchased from
Aldrich Ltd. Cesium chloride was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Fresh
human serum was obtained from the blood bank (VACSERA, Cairo, Egypt).
Further details of the instrumentation utilized are reported in the Supporting Information.

Preparation of the Cesium–Gold
Nanoparticle Sensors (Cs–Au/SPE
Sensors)
SPEs were fabricated at the Manchester Metropolitan
University. We have reported previously these fabrication steps; see
ref (51). The Cs–Au/SPE
sensors were fabricated through the electrochemical modification of
the SPEs. Different concentrations of Cs, 2.0 × 10–3, 4.0 × 10–3, 6.0 × 10–3, and 8.0 × 10–3 M were explored. We found
that 6.0 × 10–3 M Cs is the optimal concentration
with Au for codeposition. This was performed by immersing SPEs into
a solution comprising 6.0 × 10–3 M HAuCl4 and CsCl2 in 0.1 M KNO3 at a constant
potential of −0.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for 80 s to form the Cs–Au/SPE-based
surface, which forms the basis of the sensor. After this step, the
sensor was washed with bidistilled water and left to dry at 25 °C
for 45 min. The Cs–Au/SPEs were then ready to use. Characterization
of the Cs–Au/SPE is reported in the Supporting Information (Figure S2, SEM images; Figure S3, energy dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDAX)).

Recommended Experimental Procedure
Cs–Au/SPE
sensors were electrochemically cycled between the potentials of +0.8
and −1.4 V versus Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 0.1 V s–1 within pH 2.0 B–R buffer to determine the voltammetric current
from the baseline to the maximum point.

Analysis of Real Samples
Serum samples were taken from
a healthy individual just before the experiments. Ten microliters
of the supernatant were transferred quantitatively into a 5 mL volumetric
flask spiked with different volumes of DPX and SIL standard solution
(1.0 mM) in pH 2.0 B–R buffer solution. The solution was transferred
into the electrochemical cell to be analyzed without any further pretreatment.

Urine was collected from healthy donors in the morning, free of
interfering drugs. Blank urine samples were collected from five subjects,
which were then used to prepare urine standards for validation. Urine
standards were prepared by dilution with pH 2.0 B–R buffer
solution containing DPX. All urine samples were prepared and analyzed
on the day of collection. All experiments were performed in compliance
with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines, and the institutional
committees have approved these experiments.

Six capsules of
Joypox were mixed and weighed with the average
mass per tablet determined. These were then dissolved in 50.0 mL of
methanol and sonicated for 60 min. The solution was then filtered
into a 25.0 mL volume calibrated flask, and the residue was washed
three times with methanol, added to the flask, and then diluted to
the mark with the same solvent.
