A fluorescent
2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-containing goniothalamin derivative,
BTD−GTN (1), has been synthesized and successfully
tested in bioimaging experiments in live cells. The fluorescent compound
proved to be capable of transposing the cell membranes, indicating
its subcellular localization. The use of the benzothiadiazole core
as the fluorophore revealed the favored localization of the GTN analogue 1 in the cytoplasm of live cells, preferentially in the mitochondria,
in line with previous results that indicated the loss of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential upon treatment with GTN. The results described
herein highlight the potential of the BTD–GTN hybrid structures
for future studies regarding the cellular mechanism of action of this
family of compounds.

Introduction
Goniothalamin (GTN)
is a styryl lactone isolated from genus Goniothalamus (Annonaceae), which
despite its structural simplicity has shown promising antiproliferative
and cytotoxic activities against several tumor cell types.1 These effects have also been observed for several
of its derivatives.2,3 GTN is a low-molecular-weight
secondary metabolite, which can be prepared through a straightforward
synthetic procedure, and, so far, in our in vivo studies, it did not
display systemic acute toxicity in the effective doses, therefore
qualifying itself as a promising candidate for preclinical studies.
Previous studies performed by our group have shown that racemic GTN
presents gastroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory activity and
inhibits the development of Ehrlich tumor in mice.4−6 Recently, we
have also shown that GTN prevents the development of prostate cancer
in TRAMP mice as well as induces apoptosis in HT-29 colon tumor cells,
which were dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and
caspase activation.7,8

The current understanding
of its biological role points toward
its involvement in the cell redox balance due to the electrophilic
nature of the unsaturated δ-lactone and its influence on apoptotic
pathways, with some authors favoring the mitochondrial membrane potential
impairing and disbalance on the concentration of the oxidizing species.9−11

Our previous studies concerning the biochemical pathways influenced
by the action of the natural form of GTN and its enantiomer in the
human kidney cell line (786-0) showed that both compounds caused apoptosis
in renal cancer cells. Although differences in the expression of some
biochemical markers were found in this study, results indicated that
both compounds were involved in the apoptosis and autophagy processes,
albeit in different degrees.11 Additionally,
we have shown that the racemic form of GTN exhibits the same antiproliferative
profile as natural GTN when a panel of nine cancer cell lines were
evaluated. Moreover, in vivo results have shown that there is no statistically
significant difference for the antiproliferative action of both enantiomers
as well as between them and the racemic form of GTN when an Ehrlich
solid tumor model was employed.4

Despite several in vivo studies indicating the antiproliferative
and anti-inflammatory activities of GTN and derivatives,3,6 the cellular localization of GTN and its derivatives remains uncertain,
preventing a better comprehension of the cellular processes involved
and the rational design of more effective analogues for further studies.

Fluorescent probes are powerful tools in cell and chemical biology
and have contributed to our growing understanding of biological systems,
enabling us the visualization of events with a temporal and spatial
resolution. 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives are widely used
in photochemical and photophysical studies.12 Early works have proved that π-extended BTDs are also a promising
class of fluorescent heterocycles applied for live-cell-imaging experiments.13 Some of us have recently highlighted the beneficial
features of using fluorescent BTD derivatives for bioimaging experiments.14 Their capacity of transposing
the cell membrane, excellent signal-to-noise ratios, bright emission
with no notable blinking of the naked eye, and good chemical stability
and photostability in both ground and excited states are fostering
the interest of other research groups on the use of new fluorescent
derivatives incorporating the BTD core for different purposes of cell-imaging
studies.15−17 Important organelles and cell components, such as
nuclear DNA, mitochondria, lipid droplets, and others, have already
been successfully labeled by fluorescent BTD molecules.14

The strategy of using fluorescent tags
to gain insights into the
subcellular localization and mechanisms of action of bioactive compounds
typically returns attractive results and points to some preferential
cellular pathways. For instance, the cellular uptake in pancreatic
tumor cells was evaluated with a high-affinity receptor ligand (PB28)
tagged with fluorescent dansyl, indicating that it may undergo endocytic
paths.18 Subcellular labile iron pools,
which are still poorly understood, were evaluated using a new rhodamine-tagged
ferric complex, revealing that they were preferentially localized
within both endosomes and lysosomes in HeLa cells.19 Human mesenchymal stem cells proved to internalize fluorescent
thiophene-tagged compounds, allowing their subcellular localization.20 Recently, some of us have tested a fluorescent
oleic acid tagged with a BTD core to study the active internalization
process and dynamics in live cells at 4 °C (complete endocytic
pathway inhibition), depicting the preferential concentration in lipid
droplets.21

BTDs may also be used
as fluorescent tags to disclose the cellular
dynamics and the mechanism of action of bioactive compounds. Although
it is true that the incorporation of a fluorescent tag may change
the biological response of a bioactive compound, this elegant strategy
has been successfully used in several studies.22,23

In this context, we hypothesized that a hybrid structure containing
the structural motifs of GTN and BTD would be valuable to study the
cellular uptake and localization in live cells of this promising class
of styryl lactones. Figure 1 shows the structure of the planned fluorescent GTN derivative,
namely, BTD–GTN (1), bearing an electron-donating
group (4-MeOPh) attached to the BTD core, which is known to be a strong
electron acceptor heterocyclic,12 to facilitate
an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) stabilizing process and a
conjugation of the BTD core to the dihydropyran-2-one motif (GTN core)
with the BTD core, emulating the aromatic ring present in GTN.

Due to our continuing interest in the biological application
of
BTD derivatives12−14 and our ongoing research in the assessment of the
cytotoxic properties of GTN and related derivatives,2−8 we describe herein the synthesis, photophysical properties, and
cell-imaging experiments of a new BTD hybrid structure, namely, BTD–GTN
(1).

Results and Discussion
The synthesis
of the racemic form of BTD–GTN hybrid structure 1 was performed following our previously described methodology
for the synthesis of GTN (Scheme 1).3 The conversion of commercially
available aldehyde 2 to the corresponding unsaturated
ester 3 via the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons
reaction paved the way for its Suzuki coupling with 4-methoxyphenyl
boronic acid in 85% yield. Ester 4 was then converted
to BTD-aldehyde 5, which underwent allylation under standard
Grignard conditions to afford homoallylic alcohol 6.
After esterification with acryloyl chloride and ring-closing metathesis
reaction with Grubbs II catalyst, the desired BTD–GTN hybrid 1 was isolated as a fluorescent yellow solid, in 11% overall
yield from aldehyde 2, and characterized by UV–vis,
fluorescence emission, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopies
and electrospray ionization (ESI)–high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) (see Supporting Information).

evaluated in different solvents, and the results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2.

Large Stokes shifts (ranging from
104 to 152 nm) and molar extinction
coefficients (log ε values in the range of 3.94–4.00
mM–1 cm–1) are noted for BTD–GTN
(1). These results indicate a clear ICT stabilizing process
from the excited state. The lowest energy absorption bands are assigned
to characteristic π–π* transitions typical from
conjugated BTD derivatives.24 On the basis
of the data from Table 1, we could describe the solvent effect in the first excited state
using the microscopic solvent polarity parameters (ETN) in the solvatochromic method,25 applying values provided by Reichardt.26 Without considering water, the R2 value obtained from the plot is 0.80, therefore in accordance
with an efficient ICT from the first excited state.

BTD–GTN
(1) proved to be a very stable structure
even under direct and constant irradiation in aqueous media (405,
366, and 254 nm) for 120 min (Figure S1). This important feature points to efficient bioimaging experiments
without blinking or fading off (noted by the naked eye), as it is
expected for stable BTD-based fluorescent bioprobes.14,27

After the photophysical characterization, BTD–GTN (1) was further submitted to cell-imaging experiments using
five different cell lines (Figures 3 and 4, and S2–S4). BTD–GTN (1) produced fluorescent
signals at three different wavelength ranges, that is, it could be
monitored at the blue, green, and red channels. This feature is very
attractive toward multicolor staining procedures, which is a desirable
feature for fluorescent probes, as described elsewhere.22 This is because emission of 1 is
more intense depending on the irradiation wavelength, and by selecting
the appropriate photomultiplier, it is possible to acquire simultaneously
the three emission colors or a specific channel, therefore facilitating
the visualization of just one color with no interference of the others.
No photobleaching (neither fade off) under the standard operational
conditions during the image acquisition process could be noted, in
accordance with the reported photostability of BTD derivatives.15

Confocal microscopy has shown that BTD–GTN (1) was found distributed in the cytoplasm region of Caco-2
(human
colorectal cancer) cells and, to a much less extent, in the nuclei,
as depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3A–D
shows the live cell samples, whereas Figure 3E–H shows fixed Caco-2 cells. These
results suggest that BTD–GTN (1) was slightly
more accumulated in live cells than in fixed cells. All samples showed
bright fluorescent signals, especially at the green wavelength, and
the fluorescence intensities undergo a slight variation depending
on the cell type, especially at the red channel.

These results
show that BTD–GTN (1) was not
preferentially found inside the nuclei of the cells under the tested
experimental conditions (live or fixed cells), thus indicating a weak
chemical affinity between BTD–GTN (1) and the
components of the nuclei. Phase contrast images of all samples (Figure 3D,H) are shown to
verify the cell morphological aspects. The same pattern was observed
for MDA-MB-231 (invasive human breast adenocarcinoma), as depicted
in Figure 4, and for
A549 (human lung carcinoma, Figure S2),
MCF-7 (breast cancer line, Figure S3),
and RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage, Figure S4) cells, as shown in the Supporting Information file.

As recently reviewed,1 some
authors
have suggested that DNA damage by GTN action is followed by induced
apoptosis.28 This conclusion was later
confronted by other authors, whose results indicated that GTN was
responsible for the DNA-induced fragmentation.29 In our studies, we have not observed the events above,
as BTD–GTN (1) was basically accumulated in the
cytosol, more specifically in the mitochondria. In fact, other reports
have focused on cascade events after GTN induced mitochondrial membrane
potential impairing and disbalance on the concentration of oxidizing
species.11

As depicted in Figure 3, BTD–GTN
(1) was distributed in the cytoplasm
and, to some extent, in the mitochondria, thus indicating the possibility
of disbalance in the concentration of oxidizing species, followed
by apoptosis induction through cascade events, as the role of mitochondria
in cell apoptosis is well documented. Although the mechanism of the
GTN action is still open to debate and the preferential accumulation
site of the compound in a particular cell region does not necessarily
mean this is also the preferential and single point of biological
action, our results point to a mitochondrial action in line with previous
literature findings. No morphological alteration could be noted using
mouse macrophages (Figure S4), indicating
a good level of selection of the fluorescent BTD–GTN (1) as that observed for natural GTN.19,20

To confirm the preference for mitochondrial accumulation of 1, costaining experiments using the commercially available
MitoTracker Red have been performed. As the emission intensity of
BTD–GTN (1) at 543 nm is very weak compared to
that of MitoTracker Red, we adjusted the concentrations of these two
compounds so that we would be able to detect the emission by BTD–GTN
(1) when working under the recommended concentration
of Mitotracker Red, as described in Experimental
Section. Figure 5A,B shows the cell cytoplasm fluorescence distribution when stained
with BTD–GTN (1) (observed in the green channel)
and MitoTracker (red emission), respectively. Figure 5C shows the fluorescence channel overlay
from both compounds. The yellow arrowheads indicate the cell cytoplasm
region of accumulation of 1 and MitoTracker Red. The
fluorescence distribution in all samples has been therefore precisely
the same for both dyes, as seen in Figure 5C, displaying a yellow emission produced
by merging panels (A) and (B) in Figure 5. This result demonstrated that BTD–GTN
(1) has indeed accumulated inside the cell mitochondria.
A phase contrast image was also generated for all samples (Figure 5D) to verify the
morphological aspects of the cell. It was observed that
the morphological alteration in MDA-MB-231 cells, as already depicted
in Figure 4, is related
to the focal adhesion points, as indicated by the white arrows.

are shown as black voids identified by “N”. The reference
scale bar is 25 μm.

Although these morphological alterations were observed in
the MDA-MB-231
cells, the mitochondria clearly could be stained by both dyes. Both
compounds also showed the same cytoplasm regions of staining exclusions,
as noted in Figure 6A,B, which are better observed in Figure 6C,D. These black voids found in the cell
cytoplasm are likely to be endosomes and lysosomes due to their relative
position and apparent volumes in the cell.

Figure 6 Same exclusion regions
on the cell cytoplasm are shown in MDA-MB-231
cells incubated with BTD–GTN (1) and MitoTracker
Red. (A, B) Cell distributions of the fluorescence signal from BTD–GTN
(green) and MitoTracker Red staining, respectively. The same fluorescence
exclusion regions are shown in the white rectangles. (C, D) Magnified
(10-fold) images of these regions. The cell nuclei are shown as black
voids identified by “N” only in the samples stained
with BTD–GTN. The reference scale bar is 25 μm.

To confirm these results, we performed
a complementary in vitro
staining assay with BTD–GTN and rhodamine 1,2,3 using MDA-MB-231
cells as a model. These assays were performed separately to avoid
fluorescence crosstalk between the rhodamine 1,2,3 and BTD–GTN
(1) emissions. The same fluorescence cellular distributions
were observed for both compounds. The cells incubated with both compounds
showed a mild cytoplasmic staining with a fluorescence accumulation
near the cell nuclei (Figure S5). These
results provide additional evidence that BTD–GTN (1) preferentially accumulates in mitochondria, as already observed
in samples stained with the MitoTracker marker (Figure 5).

Additional in vitro experiments
were performed to collect evidence
for the cellular localization of GTN and BTD–GTN (1) using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model. We carried out two different
assays to avoid crosstalk between BTD–GTN (1)
and MitoTracker Red fluorescence emissions. First, the cells were
preincubated with GTN, followed by treatment with Mitotracker Red.
In the second experiment, the sample was prestained with MitoTracker
Red and then incubated with GTN. The results of the first experiment
indicated that the preincubation with GTN dislodged the MitoTracker
from its mitochondrial target. As a result, the intensity of the MitoTracker
emission was highly reduced (Figure 7A). When the sample was previously incubated with MitoTracker
Red, no reduction in fluorescence intensity could be observed when
GTN was added (Figure 7B). The quantitative analyses of fluorescence with these images show
a high statistical significance related to fluorescence reduction
from the sample preincubated with GTN (Figure 7E).

*** p ≤ 0.001.

Next, the samples were preincubated with different concentrations
of GTN and then stained with BTD–GTN (1). Our
results showed that GTN also displaced BTD–GTN (1) from its mitochondrial target, lowering the fluorescence emission
intensities compared to those of the samples stained only with BTD–GTN
(1), used as a positive control (Figures S6–S9). The fluorescence intensities from the
samples were calculated and analyzed. Our results showed a reduction
of fluorescence intensity related to all samples against the control
samples. Only the samples pretreated with a GTN solution at 2.5 μM
showed fluorescence intensity reduction without statistical significance
(Figure S10). In conclusion, our data strongly
suggest that BTD–GTN (1) preferentially accumulates
in the mitochondria.

As the results described above indicated
the preferential localization
of BTD–GTN (1) in the mitochondria, we considered
to evaluate the effect of GTN and BTD–GTN (1)
on the production of oxidizing species. Unfortunately, we were not
able to evaluate the role of BTD–GTN (1) in the
production of oxidizing species using the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFDA) assay and MDA-MB-231 cells due to the fluorescence
crosstalk between DCFDA and BTD–GTN (1). As expected,
when a 10 μM GTN solution was employed, an increase in the ROS
concentration compared to that of the positive control samples was
observed (Figure 8D,E).
Quantification of these effects resulted in a high degree of statistical
significance between the production of oxidizing species induced by
GTN and the production of ROS induced by H2O2 (Figure 8E). An increased
production of oxidizing species by mammal cells as well as other eukaryotic
cell models is highly correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction and
apoptosis.30−34

Conclusions
In summary, we have described the synthesis,
characterization,
and bioimaging experiments of a new BTD-containing GTN derivative.
Our data show that the mechanism of action of the GTN derivative might
involve a cascade of events, starting with its interaction with mitochondria,
as shown here for the first time for the BTD–GTN (1) hybrid. Although we were not able to determine the role of BTD–GTN
(1) in the levels of oxidizing species using MDA-MB-231
cells, the increase in their concentration in GTN-treated cells correlates
well with its mitochondrial localization, as described here. These
results open up the possibility of exploring new fluorescent BTD-containing
GTN derivatives in the investigation of the cellular mechanism of
action of this important and promising class of styryl lactone derivatives.
The synthesis and bioimaging experiments of new derivatives are underway
and will be disclosed in due course.

Biological
Studies
Cell Culture
MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma cell),
MDA-MB-231 (human breast invasive adenocarcinoma cell), Caco-2 (human
epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells), A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma
alveolar cells), and RAW 264.7 (mouse leukemic monocyte macrophage)
cells were maintained in an appropriate culture medium, as recommended
by American Type Culture Collection, supplemented with 10% of fetal
bovine serum plus 100 IU mL–1 penicillin and 100
μg mL–1 streptomycin at 37 °C, in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere.

BTD–GTN (1) Fluorescence
Assays
Cells were seeded on 13 mm round glass coverslips
on the bottom of
a 24-well plate, allowed to adhere overnight, and washed three times
with a serum-free medium to remove nonadherent cells. After reaching
confluence, the cells were separated in two samples (live samples
and fixed samples). Live cells were incubated for 30 min with a 10
μM of BTD–GTN (1) solution at 37 °C.
The samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) 1× (pH 7.4) at rt and fixed with formaldehyde (3.7%) for
30 min. The samples were washed again three times with PBS 1×
(pH 7.4) at rt, and the coverslips were mounted over the glass slides
using ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, OR) according to manufacturer’s
recommendations. The fixed samples were first washed three times in
PBS 1× (pH 7.4) and then fixed with formaldehyde (3.7%) for 30
min. After fixative procedures, the samples were washed three times
in PBS 1× (pH 7.4) at rt and incubated for 30 min with a 10 μM
of BTD–GTN solution at rt. The samples were washed three times
in PBS 1× (pH 7.4) at rt, and the coverslips were mounted over
the glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, OR) according
to manufacturer’s recommendations. The negative control was
performed by incubating the cells in 0.1% of DMSO, which was the diluent
used. The samples were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.
The wavelength used to promote the BTD–GTN (1)
excitation was 405 nm. The monitoring emission windows were 440–480
nm (blue), 520–560 nm (green), and 680–720 nm (red).
All assays were performed in triplicate and in three repetitions for
each cell sample and experimental condition.

Costaining with MitoTracker
To confirm the morphological
evidence that BTD–GTN (1) was accumulated in mitochondria,
the compound was used in a costaining assay with the commercial mitochondria
marker MitoTracker Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., NY). Briefly,
3 × 105 cells were seeded on 13 mm round glass coverslips
on the bottom of a 24-well plate, allowed to adhere overnight, and
washed three times with a serum-free medium to remove nonadherent
cells. After reaching confluence, the samples were incubated for 30
min at 37 °C with 10 μM of BTD–GTN (1) plus 100 nM of MitoTracker Red. The samples were washed three times
in PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C, and the cells were fixed in a 3.7%
formaldehyde solution for 30 min at rt. The samples were washed three
times in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted over the glass slides
using ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, OR) according to manufacturer’s
recommendations. The negative control was performed by incubation
of the samples in solutions down to 0.1% of DMSO, which was used as
the BTD–GTN (1) diluent. The samples were analyzed
using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope, according to manufacturer’s
specifications of MitoTracker Red. All assays were performed in triplicate
and in three independent repetitions.

BTD–GTN (1) and Rhodamine 1,2,3 Fluorescence
Assays
MDA-MB-231 cells (3 × 105 cells) were
seeded on 13 mm glass coverslips placed at the bottom of a 24-well
plate and allowed to adhere overnight. After reaching confluence,
the cell samples were treated with 10 μM BTD–GTN (1) and rhodamine 1,2,3 (10 μg mL–1) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with
PBS 1× (pH 7.4) and submitted to the fixation procedure with
3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. The samples were washed three times
with PBS and mounted over glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade
(Invitrogen, OR). The samples were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5
confocal microscope. Both BTD–GTN (1) and rhodamine
1,2,3 were excited with a laser wavelength of 405 nm. All assays were
performed in triplicate, and three repetitions were carried out for
each experimental condition.

Fluorescence Dislodge Assay
(GTN × MitoTracker)
MDA-MB-231 cells (3 × 105 cells) were seeded on 13
mm glass coverslips placed at the bottom of a 24-well plate and allowed
to adhere overnight. After reaching confluence, the cells were split
into four different samples. Each sample was incubated following two
different protocols: (1) the samples were previously incubated with
a GTN solution (10 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed three
times in PBS 1×, and then incubated with MitoTracker (500 nM)
for 30 min; (2) the remaining samples were previously incubated with
MitoTracker (500 nM) for 30 min, washed three times in PBS 1×,
and then incubated with a 10 μM GTN solution for 30 min. After
the staining procedures, all samples were washed again three times
with PBS 1× and submitted to the fixation procedure with 3.7%
formaldehyde for 15 min. The samples were washed three times in PBS
and mounted over glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen,
OR). The samples were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.
MitoTracker was excited with a 543 nm laser wavelength. All assays
were performed in triplicate, and three repetitions were carried out
for each experimental condition.

Fluorescence Dislodge Assay
(GTN × BTD–GTN)
MDA-MB-231 cells (3 × 105 cells) were seeded on 13
mm glass coverslips placed at the bottom of a 24-well plate and allowed
to adhere overnight. After reaching confluence, the cells were submitted
to the fixation procedure with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. The samples
were washed three times in PBS 1× and split into four different
samples. Each sample was incubated with a GTN solution at specific
concentrations (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C.
The samples were washed three times with PBS 1× (pH 7.4) and
incubated with BTD–GTN for 30 min, followed by washing three
times with PBS 1×. The positive control was performed by samples
incubated only with BTD–GTN (1) at 10 μM,
under the same conditions described above. All samples were mounted
over glass slides with ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen, OR). The
samples were analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. BTD–GTN
(1) was excited with a 405 nm laser wavelength. All assays
were performed in triplicate, and three repetitions were carried out
for each experimental condition.

Flow Cytometry for the
Detection of Oxidizing Species
The generation of oxidizing
species was measured by staining MDA-MB-231
cells with DCFDA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). MDA-MB-231 cells
(1 × 105 cells per well) were seeded on a 24-well
plate, allowed to adhere overnight, and washed three times with PBS
1× (pH 7.4) to remove nonadherent cells. After reaching confluence,
the cells were submitted to the following staining procedures: the
samples were preincubated with 25 μM DCFDA (35845; Sigma-Aldrich)
for 45 min at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS 1× (pH
7.4), and treated with a 10 μM GTN solution for 30 min at 37
°C. Hydrogen peroxide (100 mM for 20 min) was used as a positive
control to validate the protocol. After staining, the cells were washed
with PBS 1× (pH 7.4) at rt and submitted to a trypsinization
procedure at 37 °C for the removal of the cells from the plate.
The cells were analyzed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) cytometer
through 1 × 104 events in the gate. All assays were
performed in triplicate, and five repetitions were carried out for
each experimental condition.

Quantitative Analyses
The quantitative analyses of
fluorescence emission intensity were performed using 10 different
images in ImageJ free software.35 The flow
cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software version 10.0 (TriStar
Inc., CA). All numerical data were submitted to statistical analysis
through Prism GraphPad Software version 5.00 for MacOS (GraphPad Software;
La Jolla, CA).
