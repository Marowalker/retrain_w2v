In this study, we aimed to investigate
in vitro whether the synthetized
indium maltolate (InMal) and gallium maltolate (GaMal) could exert
either a toxic effect toward breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 or
an agonistic activity with mitoxantrone (MTX) in comparison to fibroblast
cell line NIH-3T3. Both GaMal and InMal reduced viability of MDA-MB-231,
and at a lesser extent of NIH3-T3, in a dose- and time-dependent mode,
the outcome was more effective in comparison to MTX sole exposure.
Both GaMal and InMal toxicity was reverted by iron citrate addition
on NIH3-T3, not on MDA-MB-231, showing indirectly that gallium and
indium’s mechanisms of action may include iron targeting. The
agonistic activity against MDA-MB-231 survival was shown pretreating
with 100 μM InMal for 24 h followed by medium exchange with
MTX at 10 ng mL–1 or vice-versa but not with co-incubation
of both compounds. In particular, InMal pretreating resulted more
protective to MTX subsequent exposure.

1 Introduction
Considering
the metallic elements, gallium (group IIIa of the periodic
table) has shown efficacy in the treatment of several apparently different
disorders.1 In recent years, gallium maltolate
(GaMal) has gained the same popularity as antimicrobial agents2−4 and antineoplastic drugs for the treatment of scarcely responding
tumors (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphomas)5,6 together with other gallium compounds that can play a significant
role as antineoplastic both in vitro and in vivo.7−12 Gallium is particularly effective against some lymphatic and urothelial
cancers, because of its ability to reach high concentrations in these
sites.1 Gallium may inhibit DNA synthesis
through substitution of Ga3+ for Fe3+ in the
M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, thus blocking its action;
furthermore, gallium seems to follow biochemical pathways similar
to those for iron absorption and metabolism in proliferating cells.1 Its action is partially attributed to this ability
to produce species that are deprived of the biological action of the
corresponding iron complexes.2−7 One of the reasons which has given GaMal so much popularity is the
absence of the typical side effects of antineoplastic agents;13 therefore, a therapy in which the effect of
gallium complexes is potentiated by the presence of classical antineoplastic
could in theory guarantee a dose reduction of the classic cytotoxic
drug with a significant decrement of side effects.

Anthracyclines
are among the most active and widely used antineoplastics,14 but their clinical use is limited by adverse
events, particularly by cardiotoxicity and by the development of tumor
cell resistance.15−17 In particular, mitoxantrone (MTX), an aminoanthraquinone
derived from classical anthracyclines, is widely used for its action
against several cancers, despite its side effects such as cardiotoxicity,
severe myelosuppression, stomatitis, high grade mucositis, and alopecia.18 These side effects put a limit to the dose that
can be administered to patients,19 typically
around 10 mg m–2 every day for up to five consecutive
days.20

Bernstein et al.,21 demonstrated that
at the administered doses investigated, GaMal was very well-tolerated
by all the human subjects, with no reports of serious treatment-related
adverse events; again, Bernstein et al.22 showed that a patient, with an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,
when treated with GaMal, has greatly increased his quality of life,
mainly because of a large reduction in pain. Furthermore, in recent
years GaMal has been the subject of studies in combination with known
chemotherapeutics, with the purpose to obtain the same anticancer
action and less side effects.23,24

Searching for
a metal with chemical properties comparable to gallium,
we considered indium, another metallic element of group 13 (IIIa),
widely studied in the field of cell labeling, both in detection and
diagnosis of infections and inflammatory lesions,25−31 but so far unexplored for antitumor activity.32 The isotopically labeled indium maltolate (InMal) is one
of the compounds recently studied,33 along
with its biodistribution, both in vitro and in vivo.34 The toxicity of indium compounds is poorly established,
and although existing data indicate that indium is more toxic than
gallium, toxicity in human (in particular teratogenicity) develops
only at high levels of exposure.35

Starting from these considerations and from the chemical properties
of group IIIa metallic elements, indium(III) maltolate (InMal) and
GaMal were synthesized and tested at increasing doses and incubation
times for their in vitro ability of killing cancerous cells such as
MDA-MB-231 in comparison to a non-neoplastic cell line, NIH-3T3. MDA-MB-231,
a triple negative breast cancer cell line and a perfect model for
chemotherapy,36 was selected as one of
the classic target of MTX.37 IC50 values, apoptosis observations, quantitative determination of gallium
and indium cell uptake, and toxicity reversion with the addition of
iron citrate, on the basis of the proposed in vivo action mechanism
of orally administered Ga, which bounds to serum transferrin,1 were also determined. Finally, the synergic effect
of both Ga or InMal and MTX was investigated to evaluate the lower
dose to be used for MTX therapeutic treatments in combination with
metallic complexes.

2 Results and Discussion
At first, the synthetized GaMal and InMal complexes were physicochemical
characterized (Figures S1–S3) and
tested for stability assessments (section 2.1) before in vitro biological assays (sections 2.2 and 2.3). MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cell lines were employed
for the study to evaluate antitumor activity of both metallic complexes.
Dose- and time-dependence cytotoxicity of GaMal or InMal (Figure 1 and Table S1) was evaluated in apoptosis observations
(Figures 2 and 3), IC50 values (Table 1), and cell uptake. Both cell types were
treated with increasing concentrations of GaMal or InMal and co-incubated
with iron citrate to indirectly evaluate similarity in the indium
sand gallium’s mechanisms of action (Figure S4).

GaMal and InMal alone or each one co-incubated with MTX (10 or 200

Section) on both MDA-MB-231 (a–f) and NIH-3T3 (g–l),
respectively. Results of MTT test are expressed as percentage related
to untreated cells (no metal complexes or MTX addition) set as 100%.

50 μM GaMal (d,i); with 50 μM InMal (e,j). PSVue480 reagent
was used to evaluate apoptotic cells (in green) in MDA-MB-231 and
NIH-3T3 cells, respectively. Nuclei were stained with PI (red). CLSM
images were magnified at 40×, scale bar: 50 μm.

50 μM GaMal (d,i); with 50 μM InMal (e,j). After 24 h,
the cell culture media were replaced with metal complexes free media
and incubated up to 144 h. PSVue480 reagent was used to evaluate apoptotic
cells (in green) in both MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cells, respectively.

Three types of experiments were performed to determine
the synergic
effects of the metal complexes with MTX on both MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3
cell lines: (1) dose- and time-dependence cytotoxicity of GaMal or
InMal co-incubated with MTX (experimental condition 1, Figure 1 and Table S2); (2) pretreatment of both cell types with GaMal or InMal
for 24 h subsequently replaced with MTX without metal complexes (experimental
condition 2, Figure 4 and Table S3); (3) pretreatment of both
cell types with MTX for 24 h subsequently replaced with GaMal or InMal
without MTX (experimental condition 3, Figure 5 and Table S4).

Figure 4 Dose-

(a–f) and NIH-3T3 cells (g–l) pretreated for 24 h with
GaMal (a–c and g–i) or InMal (d–f and j–l),
respectively (Experiment 2, see Experimental Section). The control is represented by GaMal pretreated cells for 24 h
and then incubated for the indicated time with culture media without
MTX. Results of MTT test are expressed as a percentage related to
untreated cells (no metal complexes or MTX addition) set as 100%.

(g–l), both pretreated for 24 h with MTX (10 or 200 ng mL–1), respectively (experiment 3, see Experimental Section). The control is represented by both
MTX-pretreated cell types for 24 h and then incubated for the time
indicated with culture media without metal complexes. Results of MTT
treatments were expressed as a percentage related to untreated cells
(no metal complexes or MTX) set as 100%. Bars represent the mean values
± SEM of results from three experiments (n =
3, p < 0.05).

2.1 GaMal and InMal Stability Assessments
GaMal
and InMal complexes stability was evaluated by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) at time 0 and after 14 days. Complexes
were dissolved in NIH-3T3 and MDA-MB-231 culture media and in physiological
solution as a control. Results indicated that both maltolate metal
complexes were still stable 14 days after their dissolution in culture
media (degradation < 10%), thus assuring the stability of the compounds
for the entire period of the performed experiments (data not shown).

2.2 Dose- and Time-Dependence Viability of GaMal
or InMal Treated Cells
At first, maltol, the starting material
for the synthesis of the two complexes, showed no cytotoxicity in
the whole concentration range explored (data not shown), as previously
reported by Sakagami et al.38 Furthermore,
the concentrations of the metal complexes employed in this study were
chosen close to or less than those produced in plasma by standard
GaMal dose.21,22

GaMal or InMal dose- (5,
10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 μM) and time- (24, 72, and 144 h) dependence
viability was investigated for MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1a–c,d–f; Table S1) and NIH-3T3 cells (Figure 1g–i,j–l; Table S1), respectively. The data are presented as viability
percent of untreated cells set as 100% (no addition of metal complexes
or drug). In particular, the viability percent for both cell lines
treated with the highest and the lowest concentrations (5 or 150 μM)
of GaMal or InMal, respectively, was also reported in Table S1.

In brief, at either GaMal or
InMal lowest concentrations (<25
μM) a slight reduction in MDA-MB-231 viability was observed
at any time (Figure 1a–f), whereas at the highest concentration (150 μM)
for each one of the metal complexes cell viability showed the lowest
values (<10%) at 144 h (Figure 1c,f). Although a rather similar dose- and time-dependence
viability was observed on NIH-3T3 (Figure 1g–i,j–l), it is remarkable
to highlight that cells treated with 150 μM GaMal (Figure 1i) at 144 h showed
a 3-fold higher viability in comparison to MDA-MB-231 (Figure 1c). In summary, viability of
both MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cells was consistently reduced at longer
incubation times with high doses of InMal in comparison to GaMal treatment.

To determine whether GaMal or InMal treatment induced apoptosis
on the cell lines, PSVue480 reagents and propidium iodide (PI) staining
were performed in two different experimental conditions (condition
a and b, Figures 2 and 3, respectively). In the first condition, the GaMal
or InMal (50 μM) added to the culture medium of both cell types
was kept throughout the incubation time (144 h) (Figure 2). In the second condition,
MAD-MB-231 or NIH-3T3 cells were treated with GaMal or InMal (50 μM)
for 24 h followed by removal and replacement with culture medium without
metallic complexes up to 144 h (Figure 3). A comparison with MTX treated cells was also performed
(Figure 2c,h; Figure 3c,h). In the same
day as the dye exclusion test, confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) analyses were performed on untreated cells (negative control
(Figure 2a,f; Figure 3a,f), H2O2 (positive control, Figure 2b,g; Figure 3b,g), GaMal (Figure 2d,i; and Figure 3d,i), InMal (Figure 2e,j; and Figure 3e,j), or MTX treated cells (Figure 2c,h; Figure 3c,h). As expected, MAD-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cells exhibited
markedly green fluorescence after H2O2 treatment
in both experimental conditions, showing a high level of apoptosis.
A quite similar trend for MTX treated cells (at concentration 10 ng
mL–1) was observed. As expected, no apoptosis was
observed in MDA-MB-231 and NIH3T3 untreated cells (Figure 2a,f; Figure 3a,f).

CLSM analysis of both cell lines
treated with GaMal or InMal without
(experimental condition a) or with (experimental condition b) medium
exchange (Figures 2 and 3) showed interesting differences. MDA-MB-231
and NIH-3T3 cells treated for 144 h with GaMal (experimental condition
a) showed a moderate apoptosis for the breast cancer cells with nuclei
and cytoplasm partially compromised (Figure 2d), whereas no membrane damage was observed
for the fibroblast cell line (Figure 2i). On the contrary, both cell types treated with InMal
showed some manifest differences: MDA-MB-231 cells were strongly positive
after staining with PSVue480 reagents, whereas NIH-3T3 cells were
negative (Figure 2j),
indicating that InMal treatment did induce a strong apoptosis, especially
in the breast cancer cell line (Figure 2e).

The results obtained by treating both cell
lines with GaMal followed
by culture media replacement (experimental condition b) showed only
degradation of cytoplasm for MDA-MB-231, whereas no apoptosis was
observed for NIH-3T3 cells except for the presence of some vacuoles
in the cytoplasm. On the contrary, InMal treatment followed by culture
media replacement showed no apoptosis or only slight cytoplasm degradation
on MDA-MB-231, whereas no membrane damage was observed on NIH-3T3
(Figure 3).

In
conclusion, the IC50 values were calculated for both
metal complexes to perform a quantitative comparison of experimental
conditions a and b as reported in Table 1. At short incubation time (experimental
condition a), the IC50 of InMal was consistently lower
in comparison to GaMal on MDA-MB-231 cells (32 μM vs 90 μM);
at longer incubation time, InMal treatment maintained a strong cytostatic
action with IC50 of 120 μM, whereas for GaMal IC50 > 150 μM was calculated (experimental condition
b).
A similar IC50 for both the experimental conditions was
calculated for NIH-3T3 with both metal complexes: interestingly, the
IC50 was higher in experimental condition b compared to
a (Table 1). Furthermore,
the therapeutic index of the two metal complexes, calculated as the
ratio between the IC50 value of NIH-3T3 and MDA-MB-231
cells, was approximately 1 for GaMal, and 2.3 for InMal, making the
latter more advantageous. Notably, the IC50 values for
MTX were >200 ng mL–1 (i.e. >0.45 μM)
for
MDA-MB-231 and 15 ng mL–1 (i.e. 0.034 μM)
for NIH-3T3.37

Considering these
results, GaMal and InMal were more effective
than the standard drug MTX in reducing the viability of the neoplastic
cell lines and at the same time in preserving the viability of the
NIH-3T3 cell line (red lines in Figure 1).

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis
was performed as indicated
in Experimental Section to quantitatively
determine Ga and In cell uptakes. For MDA-MB-231 cells, the absolute
amounts of gallium and indium were 25.5 and 45.2 ng, respectively,
whereas for NIH-3T3 52 and 190 ng (in 5 × 106 cells
for both lines). Because 2.44 × 108 cells occupy a
volume of 1 cm339 and the density
of cells is near 1 g cm–3, an internal concentration
of Ga 18 μM and In 20 μM for the MDA-MB-231 cells was
calculated, showing a ratio between cell internal content and culture
medium of 40% for Ga and 36% for In, respectively. However, the internal
concentration of Ga 37.5 μM and In 83.5 μM was determined
for the NIH-3T3 cells. A ratio between cell internal content and culture
medium of 167% for Ga and 75% for In was determined, respectively.
These data suggest that both metal complexes can penetrate both cell
lines but, unexpectedly, the greatest concentration was found in the
non-neoplastic cells, but with a reduced toxicity. We may argue that
the toxicity of the metal complexes is quite selective for the neoplastic
cells, reasonably because of their enhanced metabolism and turnover.40 Moreover, non-neoplastic cells have a reparatory
mechanism that can prevent a cascade-reaction toward cell death when
the homeostasis is perturbed with the metal complex, while cancerous
cells present metabolic dysregulations that ultimately could lead
to cell death when perturbation are introduced40 (see also section 2.3).

2.3 Cell Recovery by Iron Citrate
in the Copresence
of GaMal or InMal
Gallium compounds were reported to inhibit
tumor cell growth by targeting iron homeostasis.1,12 Therefore,
we tested whether the reduced viability of InMal treated cells could
be reversed by the contemporary addition of iron(III) citrate (50
and 500 μM) and we compared these results with those obtained
in the same conditions with GaMal. At longer incubation times (144
h), no reversibility in cell viability of MDA-MB-231 treated with
either InMal or GaMal (50 μM) in the co-presence of the lowest
iron(III) citrate concentration was observed; nevertheless, a supplementary
reduction in cell viability was detected (>15%) at higher doses
of
iron citrate (500 μM). As previously reported,12 in the in vivo situation gallium has a unique mechanism
of action because it can interpose itself between proteins and processes
in lieu of iron and disrupt critical iron-dependent steps in cell
function. Because of similar results obtained with InMal treatments,
we indirectly hypothesized that indium and gallium’s mechanisms
of action include iron targeting. Differently from NIH-3T3, cell death
was only sensibly reduced following InMal or GaMal (50 μM) treatment
in the presence of 250 μM iron(III) citrate (>20%) (Figure S4).

These in vitro test results
are important because they would suggest that if GaMal or InMal are
co-incubated with high iron(III) citrate doses, a selective rescue
effect on non-neoplastic cells could be predicted, whereas the toxicity
toward neoplastic cells seems to be conserved. The role of iron in
cell viability and proliferation is well-known, as certain malignant
cells need a greater requirement for iron than normal cells.41 Furthermore, proteins involved in iron import,
export, and storage may be altered in cancer cells as previously reported.12

2.4 Evaluation of the Synergic
Effects of the
Metallic Complexes with MTX
2.4.1 Dose- and Time-Dependence
Viability of Cells
Co-Incubated with Either GaMal or InMal and MTX
Viability
of both cell lines was monitored in culture media with increasing
concentrations as previously reported for each metal complex in the
copresence of MTX at 10 and 200 ng mL–1, respectively
(Figure 1 and Table S2). For MTX exposure, the chosen concentrations
were the highest and lowest doses of a chemotherapeutic treatment
respectively. MTX cell treatment at both doses and incubation times
showed a higher reduction in cell viability on NIH3T3 (<10%) than
on MDA-MB-231 (around 35–40%) (as reported in Table S1); cell viability was dose- and time-dependent.

The co-incubation of increasing concentrations of both metallic complexes
with 10 ng mL–1 MTX determined a high reduction
in cell viability on both MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3: also, the data appeared
lower in comparison to MTX treatment alone but greater with respect
to sole metallic complexes exposure with higher doses and longer incubation
times for both GaMal and InMal (Figure 1). The trend was quite similar using 200 ng mL–1 MTX. The viability percent for both cell lines treated
with the highest and lowest concentrations (5 or 150 μM) of
GaMal or InMal, respectively, in the presence of MTX was also reported
in Table S2.

Summing up the results
of Experiment 1 (Figure 1 and Table S2),
the combined addition of increasing concentrations of GaMal and MTX
at 10 or 200 ng mL–1 did not show synergic effect
on both cell lines, with viability comparable to the one obtained
by MTX treatment alone. At the most elevated concentrations and incubation
times, InMal was more toxic than MTX alone but with cell viability
comparable to the sole InMal exposure on MDA-MB-231, whereas no great
differences were observed on NIH-3T3.

As previously reported,
when more than one chemotherapeutic is
administered, a direct combination of them could not always lead to
a synergic effect, but antagonism or null addition of the effects
may be obtained.42 Even if the mechanism
of action of the administered chemotherapeutics is different, no certainty
of the synergic effect may be expected. In our experimental setup,
the co-incubation of metallic complexes with MTX was not beneficial
to reduce cell viability. To better evaluate the synergic/antagonistic
effect of MTX and the metallic complexes, we investigated whether
cells pretreatment with maltolate complexes or MTX followed by medium
replacement and supplementation with each one of the mentioned compounds
and drug could improve the reduction in viability of neoplastic cells
without showing an important toxic effect on NIH-3T3.

2.4.2 Dose- and Time-Dependence Viability of Pretreated
GaMal or InMal Cells with MTX
As indicated in Experimental Section, both cell types were incubated with
GaMal or InMal with increasing concentrations for 24 h; then, the
culture medium was removed and replaced with no metal complexes (as
a control) or supplemented with MTX either at 10 or 200 ng mL–1 and incubated up to 144 h (Figure 4 and Table S3).

MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cell lines pretreated with increasing concentrations
of GaMal or InMal followed by replacement with fresh medium without
metallic complexes (controls) showed some differences (Figure 4). GaMal pretreatment determined
an increment in cells viability at longer incubation times (144 h)
on MDA-MB231 (Figure 4c), whereas on NIH-3T3 (Figure 4i) the cell survival was marginally reduced; InMal
showed a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity on MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4d–f), whereas
on NIH-3T3 cells (Figure 4j–l) no manifest reduction in cell viability was observed.

The pretreatment of both cell lines with GaMal or InMal for 24
h, followed by medium exchange and supplementation with MTX at both
10 and 200 ng mL–1 was different with respect to
their controls (Figure 4). On both MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cell lines, the sequential treatment
reduced cell viability because of the addition of MTX but with some
clear differences. MTX at 10 ng mL–1 was less cytotoxic
on GaMal pretreated MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4a–c) in comparison with NIH3T3 cells either
at shorter or longer incubation times (Figure 4g–i); InMal pretreated MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 4d–f)
did not reduce viability at lower concentration of InMal, but cells
were more sensibly affected at higher concentrations, whereas for
NIH-3T3 the cell survival was quite higher (around 50–70%)
at all doses and incubation times (Figure 4j–l). At the higher MTX concentration
(200 ng mL–1), the dose- and time-dependent viability
was greatly reduced on GaMal pretreated NIH-3T3 than on MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 4); survivability
of MDA-MB-231 was significantly reduced at higher concentrations of
InMal pretreatment for longer incubation time if compared to NIH-3T3
cell, whose values were more constant at all doses and incubation
times even if low (Figure 4). The viability percent for both cell lines treated with
the highest and lowest concentrations (5 or 150 μM) of GaMal
or InMal, respectively, followed by MTX incubation was also reported
in Table S3.

As a conclusion of experimental
condition 2 (Figure 4 and Table S3),
the addition of 10 ng mL–1 MTX exerted its synergic
effect more clearly on MDA-MB-231 pretreated with higher doses (>50
μM) and longer incubation times (144 h) of InMal (viability
< 2–5%), whereas a lower reduction on NIH-3T3 cell viability
at all doses and times (viability > 55%) was detected. NIH-3T3
InMal
pretreatment showed to be more protective to the subsequent addition
of MTX at lower dose. On the contrary, the GaMal pretreatment reduced
twice NIH-3T3 cell viability.

2.4.3 Dose-
and Time-Dependence Viability of MTX
Pretreated Cells with GaMal or InMal
The previously reported
experiment in section 2.4.2 was repeated changing the sequence of the drugs addition
(experimental condition 3). Both MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cells were
pretreated for 24 h with 10 or 200 ng mL–1 MTX;
then, the culture medium was removed and replaced with the new culture
medium alone (as a control) or supplemented with increasing concentrations
of GaMal or InMal, respectively (Figure 5 and Table S4).

MTX cell pretreatment followed by new culture media replacement
(control) presented at both doses and incubation time a higher reduction
in cell viability on NIH-3T3 (<3%) than on MDA-MB-231 (around 35–40%)
(Figure 5).

On
MDA-MB-231, the MTX pretreatment at both concentrations showed
some differences: at 10 ng mL–1 MTX, the cell viability
with GaMal was reduced at 40–50% without great differences
in doses and times (Figure 5a–c), whereas with InMal the viability was quite high
at low doses at any time (100%) and drastically reduced with high
concentrations of the metallic complex at 144 h (Figure 5f). At higher MTX pretreatment,
the cell survival with GaMal was even greater at short incubation
time and similar to the sole MTX treatment at any time and doses (Figure 5d–f); with
InMal addition, the viability was dose- and time-dependent, reaching
a very low survivability with high concentration of InMal at 144 h
(Figure 5f).

On NIH-3T3, pretreatment with MTX 10 ng mL–1 followed
by GaMal addition determined a higher cell survival at any time and
doses in comparison to MTX, whereas with InMal the values of cell
viability were similar to sole MTX treatment (Figure 5g–i). At MTX 200 ng mL–1, the cell viability with GaMal or InMal was dose- and time-dependent
for both metallic complexes even if the values were slightly higher
in comparison to sole MTX action (Figure 5j–l).

The viability percent
for both cell lines treated with MTX and
followed by the highest and lowest concentrations (5 or 150 μM)
of GaMal or InMal, respectively, was also reported in Table S4.

In conclusion in our experimental
conditions, the synergic action
against MDA-MB-231 survival was observed with MTX pretreatment at
10 ng mL–1 followed by exposure to InMal at high
doses and incubation times (>50 μM and 144 h).

3 Conclusions
Both metallic complexes showed a higher
dose- and time-dependence
toxicity on MDA-MB-231 than on NIH-3T3 cells, independently of their
internal uptake: 2-fold Ga and 4-fold In were greater in NIH-3T3 in
comparison with MDA-MB-231 cells. In general, InMal was more toxic
than GaMal. In fact, the InMal calculated IC50 value was
3-fold lower than GaMal on MDA-MB-231 with respect to NIH-3T3 at shorter
incubation times; the IC50 value was a 1-fold lower than
GaMal on the neoplastic cells in comparison with the fibroblast cell
line at 144 h, making InMal an efficient anticancer compound. The
GaMal IC50 value calculated for the first time on MDA-MB-231
cell line was 4-fold higher in comparison to the IC50 value
previously detected on four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.37 The apoptosis tests (PSVue480) showed that both
these metal complexes produced cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects,
clearly manifested on NIH-3T3 cells. Interestingly, the co-incubation
of the complexes with iron citrate did not revert the toxicity toward
MDA-MB-231 but exert a significant protective effect toward NIH-3T3
cells, indicating that InMal may act on iron metabolism. Further investigations
need to be performed at a deeper level.

No synergic effect of
either GaMal or InMal co-incubated with the
well-known cytotoxic MTX was detected on both cell types: cell viability
was quite similar to the sole metallic complexes treatment, even though
it was reduced in comparison to MTX exposure alone. On the contrary,
a synergic effect was observed when pretreating both cell types with
InMal followed by culture medium replacement and supplementation with
MTX at 10 ng mL–1 or vice versa. The main conclusion
drawn by these data showed the necessity to administer the metallic
complexes and MTX not in contemporary but separately.

Gallium
and indium malonate represent an important advance in the
development of therapeutic metallic-based drugs. Further investigation
into GalMal and InMal antineoplastic activity and toxicity in tumor-bearing
animal models with/without MTX treatment needs to be pursued to determine
whether these agents should be advanced to clinical trials and used
with other chemotherapeutics. Moreover, the unique mechanism of action
that excludes the induction of classical apoptotic path may reasonably
prove that drugs can be effective against multidrug resistant cancers,
that is, when classical antineoplastic agents failed. The side effect
profile of the two complexes is also very interesting; as from the
small amount of literature and data available, it appears such that
GaMal is neither myelotoxic nor prone to cause classical side effects
correlated with chemotherapy, and paradoxically, GaMal showed some
antibiotic and mucoprotective effects that can counteract the side
effects of chemotherapy.1−9

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Material
Preparation and Physicochemical Characterization
4.1.1 Synthesis of GaMal
GaMal was made
by a modification of a known procedure:21,43 gallium nitrate
nonahydrate (Ga(NO3)3·9H2O corresponding
to 7 g gallium, 0.10 mol) was dissolved in 200 mL water; the solution
was brought at 70 °C and 45 g maltol (0.36 mol) was carefully
added in 5 g portions; each addition is done when the precedent was
completely dissolved. A clear solution was obtained. The pH of the
resulting solution was raised to approximately 8 by the gradual addition
of 2 M NaOH. The solution was heated to approximately 70 °C for
10 min and then cooled to 5 °C. The resulting white to light
beige crystalline precipitate was filtered, dispersed in 100 mL boiling
water, then cooled and filtered again. The solid was treated with
100 mL boiling ethanol, cooled to 5 °C, filtered, additionally
washed with 100 mL ethanol, and finally dried at 50 °C. Yield:
84% (from gallium). Gallium content (by inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)): 15.2%; theoretical: 15.7%. 1H NMR, 13C NMR (Figure S1a,b) and IR data (Figure S3a) obtained are
in line with the literature:81H NMR (DMSO-d6): 2.35 (s, 3H, CH3), 6.78 (d, J3 = 5, 1 Hz, 1H, −CH–C=O), 8.33 (d, J3 = 5,
1 Hz, 1H, −C–O–C–CH) ppm; 13C NMR (DMSO-d6):
14.74 (CH3), 108.63 (−CH=CH–C=O),
149.08 (−C–O–C–(CH3)), 151.12 (−C–O–Ga),
155.68 (O–CH=C (CH3)), 175.08 (−C=O) ppm. In particular,
in the 1H NMR performed in the nonproton exchanging solvent
DMSO-d6, the OH proton at 8.7 ppm44 of maltol is accordingly absent from the spectrum
of the complexes. The other change on complex formation is the deshielding
of protons 5 and 6 and to a lesser extent of the methyl protons. This
is a natural consequence of electron donation from the chelating oxygen
atoms. IR spectra of the complexes shows the disappearance of the
broad band at 3250 cm–1 attributable to the maltol
free −OH, involved in the complexation of Ga or In.

4.1.2 Synthesis of InMal
InMal was prepared
similarly to GaMal following a known procedure:44,45 to 45 mmol indium nitrate dissolved in 100 mL water and kept to
90 °C, 20.2 g of maltol (0.16 mol) was added in 5 g portions;
the solution was made alkaline with 2 M sodium hydroxide (pH ≈
9) and warmed for 5 min, and then, the precipitate was collected at
room temperature and dried naturally overnight. The solid obtained
was recrystallized from methanol/water. Yield: 90% (from indium).
Indium content (by ICP-OES): 22.9%; theoretical: 23.4%. 1H NMR, 13C NMR (Figure S2a,b) and IR data obtained for InMal (Figure S3b), are in line with the literature:44,451H NMR (DMSO-d6): 2.39 (s, 3H, CH3), 6.80 (d, J3 = 5, 1 Hz, 1H, −CH–C=O), 8.33 (d, J3 = 5,
1 Hz, 1H, −C–O–C–CH) ppm; 13C NMR (DMSO-d6):
14.57 (CH3), 109.68 (−CH=CH–C=O),
149.06 (−C–O–C–(CH3)), 152.91(−C–O–Ga),
154.59 (O–CH=C (CH3)), 175.32 (−C=O) ppm. The same
considerations reported for GaMal regarding the NMR spectra (see above)
also apply for InMal. IR spectra of the complexes shows the disappearance
of the broad band at 3250 cm–1 attributable to the
maltol free −OH, involved in the complexation of Ga or In.

4.1.3 Physicochemical Characterization of GaMal
and InMal
PerkinElmer Optima 3300 Dual Vision ICP-OES was
used, following standard procedures suggested by the manufacturer.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were registered on
a 300 MHz Bruker AVANCE instrument measurements were performed in
DMSO-d6 solutions at 20 °C. Chemical
shift values are given in δ units with reference to internal
reference TMS (see Figures S1 and S2).

The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra were recorded on
powder samples using a Nicolet FT-IR iS10 spectrophotometer (Nicolet,
Madison, WI) equipped with an attenuated total reflectance sample
cell (Smart iTR with ZnSe dish). The spectra (4000–600 cm–1) were collected adding 56 scans, at a resolution
of 2 cm–1. The background consists of 56 scans,
collected under the same conditions (see Figure S3).

4.1.4 Stability of GaMal and
InMal
Stability
tests were performed by HPLC studies of 50 μM GaMal or InMal
solutions in MDA-MB-231 or NIH-3T3 culture media and in physiological
solution (H2O with 0.9% NaCl) at time 0 and after 14 days,
following the diminishing of the peak of the complex. HPLC was performed
on 20 cm C-18 columns using a 60:40 acetonitrile/water eluent, flux
1 mL min–1, detection at 260 nm.

4.2 Biological Characterizations
4.2.1 Cell
Types and Culture Conditions
The human breast cancer cell
line, MDA-MB-231 (HTB26),46 as well as
the murine fibroblast cell line,
NIH-3T3 (CRL1658), were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Leibovitz’s
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% p/v Fetal Bovine Serum (Biowest),
0.5% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Lonza), and 0.2% p/v
Fungizone (EuroClone). NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) modified medium with 4.5 g L–1 glucose (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% Bovine
Calf Serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% p/v l-glutamine (Lonza).
Both cell lines were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2, routinely trypsinized after confluence, then counted, and seeded
into wells.

4.2.2 Cell Viability Assay
MDA-MB-231
and NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 viable cells/well
on 96-well plates and incubated for 4 h (to allow cells to attach
to the well). At first, maltol, the starting material for the synthesis
of the two complexes, was tested for cytotoxicity in the whole concentration
range used for the experiment. The nontoxic effect of maltol was the
starting point to determine dose- and time-dependence cytotoxicity
of GaMal or InMal. Both cell types were cultured with increasing concentrations
(from 5 to 150 μM) of each metal complex and incubated for three
time points, respectively (24, 72, and 144 h).

MTX, GaMal, and
InMal cytotoxicity were evaluated by MTT assay.47 In brief, the culture medium was replaced by 100 μL
Leibovitz’s (for MDA-MB-231 cells) or DMEM high glucose (for
NIH-3T3 cells) supplemented with 10 μL of a 5 mg mL–1 solution of MTT in 1× phosphate buffered saline (137 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and the cell cultures were incubated for
3 h. Viable cells are able to reduce MTT into formazan crystals. After
the addition of 100 μL of solution C (2-propanol and HCl 0.04%),
the well plate containing the cultured cells was incubated at 37 °C
for 30 min. Aliquots of 100 μL were sampled, and the absorbance
was measured at 595 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). A standard curve of cell viability for both either
MDA-MB-231 cells and NIH-3T3 cells was used to convert the results
into control percent (no treatment with metal complexes or drug).

4.2.3 Assessment of Apoptosis
To measure
apoptosis, MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cells were labeled using the PSVue480
cell stain according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular
Targeting Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, the cells were seeded on glass
slides (Thermo Scientific) at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well and incubated with H2O2 (positive
control; 100 mM), without maltolate complexes (negative control),
with MTX 200 ng mL–1, and with GaMal or InMal for
144 h (experimental condition a) or for 24 h followed by medium replacement
without compounds and further incubation up to 144 h (experimental
condition b). All samples were prepared, following the seeding procedure
reported previously. At the end of incubation time, the cells were
stained with PSVue480 solution prepared as follows: a 2 mM solution
of preweighed apo-PSS480 was prepared in DMSO until the solid apo-PSS480
was fully dissolved; an equal volume of 4.2 mM zinc nitrate solution
was then added, and the solution was placed in a water bath at 37
°C and shaken for 30 min to ensure complete complex formation,
obtaining a clear orange solution of 1 mM stock PSVue480 in 1:1 DMSO.
The samples were stained with 10 mM PSVue480 by gently shaking for
2 h at room temperature and finally washed with TES buffer, consisting
of 5 mM TES (n-[tris(hydroxymethyl)]-2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid, Sigma-Aldrich) and 145 mM NaCl in distilled water. Samples were
then counterstained with a PI solution (2 mg mL–1) to target the cellular nuclei and observed with a CLSM system (Leica
TCS SPII Microsystems, Bensheim, Germany) at 40× magnification.48

4.2.4 Ga and In Uptake Studies
by ICP Analysis
To this end, MDA-MB-231 and NIH-3T3 cells
were seeded at 5 ×
104 viable cells in a 250 mL flask, incubated for 72 h
with the appropriate culture medium (15 mL) containing 50 μM
of one of the chosen metal complex. The medium was removed, and the
cells carefully washed three times with physiological solution and
trypsinized as described above. The cells were centrifuged at about
1200 rpm for 3 min, suspended in NaCl 0.9% (5 mL) and centrifuged
again; the procedure was repeated twice. The cells, suspended in 5
mL NaCl 0.9%, were counted in a Burke chamber (10 μL cell suspension
+10 μL Trypan Blue, 0.4%), and a volume corresponding to 5 ×
106 cells was centrifuged (3 min, 12 000 rpm). The
precipitate was digested with 250 μL ultrapure nitric acid (65%
p/p) and after dilution to 3 mL, gallium or indium content was determined
by ICP-mass spectrometry (MS) following standard procedures suggested
by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer ICP-MS-DRCe: inductively coupled
plasma equipped with a mass spectrometric detector and a direct reaction
cell).

4.2.5 Reversion of Toxicity of GaMal and InMal
by iron(III) Citrate
It was reported that in vivo Ga(III)
follows the route of cellular uptake of Fe(III) and antagonize in
part its effect.1,12 To this end, both MDA-MB-231
and NIH-3T3 cells were incubated with a solution of ferric citrate
(FeCit 250 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μM GaMal or InMal
at different times (24, 72, and 144 h) to ascertain any competition
or antagonism between these substances (Figure S4).

4.2.6 Evaluation of the Synergic
Activity of Metallic
Complexes with MTX
To determine the synergic activity of
the metal complexes with MTX treatment, three types of experiments
were performed:

Experiment 1: both cell types were cultured
with increasing concentration of GalMal or InMal in the presence of
MTX at two different concentrations (10 or 200 ng mL–1) for three different time points, respectively (24, 72, and 144
h).

Experiment 2: both cell types were cultured with increasing
concentrations
(from 5 to 150 μM) of GaMal or InMal for 24 h. Then, the culture
media was removed, changed with new culture media containing MTX (10
or 200 ng mL–1), and incubated for three different
time points, respectively (24, 72, and 144 h). As a control, GaMal-
or InMal-treated cells of both cell lines were incubated with new
culture media, free of any compounds.

Experiment 3: both cell
types were cultured with MTX (10 or 200
ng mL–1) for 24 h. Then, the drug was removed and
changed with increasing concentrations (from 5 to 150 μM) of
GaMal or InMal added in the culture media and incubated for three
different time points, respectively (24, 72, and 144 h). As a control,
MTX-treated cells of both cell lines were incubated with new culture
media, free of any compounds.

Cell viability was determined
as previously indicated in section 4.2.2.

4.3 Statistical
Analysis
Each experiment
consisted of three replicates for each condition and was repeated
three times. Results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
To compare the results between the control and each treated sample,
the one-way ANOVA test was applied (p < 0.05).
