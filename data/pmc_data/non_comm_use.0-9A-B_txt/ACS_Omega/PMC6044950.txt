Nowadays, tumor hypoxia has become a more predominant problem for diagnosis as well as treatment
of cancer due to difficulties in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs
and their carriers to these regions with reduced vasculature and oxygen
supply. In such cases, external physical stimulus-mediated drug delivery,
such as ultrasound and magnetic fields, would be effective. In this
work, the effect of simultaneous exposure of low-intensity pulsed
ultrasound and static magnetic field on colon (HCT116) and hepatocellular
(HepG2) carcinoma cell inhibition was assessed in vitro. The treatment,
in the presence of anticancer drug, with and without magnetic carrier,
significantly increased the reactive oxygen species production and
hyperpolarized the cancer cells. As a result, a significant increase
in cell inhibition, up to 86%, was observed compared to 50% inhibition
with bare anticancer drug. The treatment appears to have relatively
more effect on HepG2 cells during the initial 24 h than on HCT116
cells. The proposed treatment was also found to reduce cancer cell
necrosis and did not show any inhibitory effect on healthy cells (MC3T3).
Our in vitro results suggest that this approach has strong application
potential to treat cancer at lower drug dosage to achieve similar
inhibition and can reduce health risks associated with drugs.

1 Introduction
In general, around the
tumor environment, highly proliferating
mass of cells cause oxygen deficiency,1 leading to the formation of hypoxic zones, which are difficult to
penetrate by the standard chemotherapeutic or anticancer drugs due
to reduced vascular structure.2 Similarly,
radiotherapy is also ineffective to treat tumors with deoxygenated
regions, as molecular oxygen is essential to achieve the desired biological
effect of ionizing radiation on cancer.3 Hypoxia is also known to effect tumor cell division and invasion
(autonomous functions) and nonautonomous processes, such as angiogenesis,
lymph angiogenesis, and inflammation, which are observed during metastasis.4 Therefore, researchers developed a magnetic field-assisted
treatment, where the drug-loaded vehicles are guided and delivered
to the hypoxic regions of the tumor using external magnetic fields.
External magnetic fields are also being used to trigger the release
of drug from the magnetic carrier at the tumor site.5 Surface-modified microbubbles, triggered by external ultrasound
(US), have also been used to treat the hypoxic zone of human breast
cancer. The potential application of such ultrasound-triggered oxygen
delivery to solid tumors improved the condition of tumor within 30
days.6 The potential of this approach in
targeting brain tumor using magnetic drug carriers has also been demonstrated.7,8 Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) have been extensively used for various
biomedical applications including cancer.8 Ferromagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) become magnetized under externally
applied magnetic fields and can easily agglomerate even in the absence
of magnetic fields. However, the use of paramagnetic or weakly ferromagnetic
NPs can eliminate this problem as they do not exhibit magnetization
in the absence of externally applied magnetic fields.9 Therefore, paramagnetic or weakly ferromagnetic NPs can
be easily dispersed by magnetic field for uptake of phagocytes and
increasing their half-life in the circulation.10

An important variant of magnetic field-based cancer
treatment involves
hyperthermia using MNP,11 where extreme
temperature elevation in the tumor cells (>40 °C) leads to
denaturation
of the cellular protein and cellular death. However, the use of MNP
as drug-delivery system (DDS) is associated with issues such as difficulties
in measuring dose concentration, dose dumping, and restricted range
of hyperthermia.12 Accumulation of MNP
also effects their biological response as DDS leads to rapid clearance
of MNP from cells;13 therefore, high concentration
of MNP is required to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome. According
to the literature, minimum concentration of MNP required for effective
hyperthermia is between 1 and 2 mol/kg body mass, which is significantly
higher than the concentration required for magnetic resonance imaging
and can effect nearby healthy tissues.14 More importantly, after repeated hyperthermia, the cells were found
to exhibit thermoresistance again and therefore the treatment efficacy
decreases.15 On the other hand, external
magnetic fields have been used to avoid agglomeration and accumulation
of MNP, which can lead to local toxicity.16

In general, the use of static magnetic fields (SMF) as adjuvant
therapy toward cancer treatment has shown some promising results in
animal studies.17−20 SMF increased the oxidative stress leading to cellular membrane
damage and apoptosis in cancer cells.21 Moreover, the interaction between the SMF (200–2000 mT) and
polar, ionic molecules of the cancer cellular compartment can also
generate reactive oxygen species (ROS)22 and thus inhibit their growth. ROS production23 is also found to damage the ion channels of cancer cells,
leading to changes in their morphology and apoptosis. The application
of SMF along with anticancer drug improved the drug efficacy and can
eliminate the probability of scar formation and infection.24 In myelogenous leukemia (K562) cells, the use
of 8.8 mT SMF effectively enhanced the potencies of various drugs
(cisplatin, taxol, doxorubicin (DOX), and cyclophosphamide).25 Large apophyses of 0.47 μm diameter and
irregular apophyses (1.85 and 2.04 μm in diameter) were formed
with SMF application, which triggered the uptake of anticancer drug
and enhanced the potency of these drugs.26 It appears that the use of SMF is effective in addressing the thermoresistance
of cancer cells to repeated hyperthermia and high concentration of
MNP required to create effective hyperthermia.

Another important
noninvasive cancer treatment approach is ultrasound
(US)-mediated targeted drug delivery,27 which depends on mechanical effects to induce stress response and
apoptosis in several cancer cell lines.28−31 US-assisted cancer treatment
effectively enhanced cancer cell inhibition or death in the presence
of drugs and DDS.32−36 Typically, US creates acoustic waves within the biological soft
tissues through nonthermal physical mechanisms that produce molecular
vibration in the tissue, resulting in mechanical stimulation to accelerate
membrane potential changes.37 Among different
types of US, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) was found to
alter cellular membrane properties in damaged or diseased cells without
effecting the normal cells.38 Human uterine
sarcoma cell line (FU-MMT-3) treated with LIPUS (1 MHz, 2 W/cm2, 50% duty cycle, 60 s) in the presence of irinotecan (CPT-11)
and SN3838 showed VEGF inhibition. Similarly,
the effectiveness of doxorubicin (DOX) on human primary liver cancer
cells has been enhanced with the application of LIPUS.39

Nonetheless, the concept of utilizing
SMF along with LIPUS to facilitate
enhanced drug delivery is not reported yet. In this investigation,
we have examined the use of SMF in the presence of LIPUS, which can
create Lorentz force on the cells/tissues,22 that rapidly oscillates the cells/ions/tissue and generates local
electrical currents/fields.22 Since the
endogenous electrical fields, present in the extracellular milieu,
influence the cell behavior,40 the SMF
+ LIPUS-generated in situ fields can also influence cellular membrane,
nucleus,41 etc. Some investigators demonstrated
the effectiveness of externally applied electrical fields in treating
melanomas,42 enhanced drug inhibitory effects43 and tumors.44 Therefore,
it is believed that the electrical fields generated in situ with the
combined use of SMF and LIPUS can influence cancer cell activities
and that the mechanical stress generated due to LIPUS might also have
a synergetic role. In this investigation, we have focused to evaluate
the influence of LIPUS + SMF treatment on cancer cell inhibition in
the presence of MNP with anticancer drugs. We have also made an attempt
to understand the response of two different cancer cells to this external
treatment.

2 Results
2.1 Characteristics of MNP
and Methotrexate (MT)
+ MNP
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of MNP, presented
in Figure 1a, revealed
all peaks corresponding to α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS
no. 24-0072). No other phases were observed in the calcined MNP. The
crystallite size of the MNP calculated using the Scherrer formula
was 25 nm, while the particle size of MT + MNP determined using the
dynamic laser scattering technique was found to be 61 nm (Figure 1b). The ζ potential
of MT + MNP was 50 mV, which signifies its stability in suspension
for use as DDS. From the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra,
two broad peaks at 555 and 463 cm–1 were identified
for MNP (Figure 1c-A),
which correspond to Fe–O stretching and bending vibration modes
of α-Fe2O3, respectively.45 The presence of a band at 1663 cm–1 is
attributed to C=O double bond and C–O stretching vibration.46 The absorption band of MT + MNP at 1385 cm–1 (Figure 1c-B) indicates high intensity of nitrate (NO3–) anions in their structure, which is an indication
of MT adsorption on the surface of MNP. This is further corroborated
by the absorption band in the broad range of 3400 cm–1, which can be due to the stretching vibration of structural hydroxyl
groups of surface-adsorbed water on MT + MNP.

h. (b) Particle size analysis of MT + MNP. (c) FTIR spectra of (A)
MNP (α-Fe2O3), (B) MT + MNP (MT + α-Fe2O3), and (C) MT. (d) Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis

analysis of MT + MNP. (g) Release of MT from MT + MNP in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4).

During thermogravimetric analysis, the mass loss up to 250
°C
in MT + MNP (Figure 1d-B) was due to the removal of loosely bound water from the powder.
The decomposition between 220 and 400 °C was attributed to the
decomposition of adsorbed nitrate ions from MT and dehydroxylation
of the powder. The total mass loss of MNP was very low, up to 1000
°C (2.92%, Figure 1d-A). In the case of MT + MNP, it was 51.82% (Figure 1d-B), in which the initial mass loss, until
425 °C, was because of the water molecules of MNP. On the basis
of thermogravimetric analysis, the immobilization of MT on MNP was
estimated to be 48.82%. The magnetic behaviors of MNP and MT + MNP,
shown in Figure 1e-A,e-B,
respectively, demonstrate that both MNP samples exhibit weak ferromagnetic
behavior with a slight paramagnetic behavior. The saturation magnetization
of MNP was found to be higher (0.62 emu/g) than that of MT + MNP with
a saturation magnetization of 0.27 emu/g. The decrease in the magnetization
of MT + MNP could be due to the adsorption of a large amount (48.82%)
of MT on its surface. The presence of diamagnetic coating or material
on MNP can decrease the magnetic moment and therefore result in low
magnetization.47−49

As shown in Figure 1f, the MT + MNP powder appears to have an
average size of ∼50
nm. Figure 1g shows
cumulative release of MT from MT + MNP in PBS at pH 7.4. The initial
burst release of 80 wt % of MT during 8 h incubation was due to desorption
of the strained MTX molecule bound to MNP. Cumulative release kinetics
of MT from MNP was fitted into the Korsmeyer–Peppas model,50 following X = k(t – α)n, where X, t, k, α, and n are the drug release (%), release
time, kinetics constant, modified parameter, and an exponent, respectively.50 The exponent n (apparently R2) is normally used to describe different release
mechanisms. The value of exponent n was estimated
to be 0.88, which indicates that the release behavior of MT from MT
+ MNP is predominantly diffusion-controlled.

2.2 Influence
of LIPUS + SMF Treatment on Cancer
Cell Proliferation
Initially, proliferation of HCT116 and
HepG2 cells was assessed using 30 mW/cm2 LIPUS and its
combination with 3.5 and 150 mT SMF, and the results are presented
in Figure 2a,d, respectively.
The proliferation of HCT116 cells marginally reduced when exposed
to LIPUS during the first 24 h (Figure 2a) and the cell proliferation decreased at later culture
durations. A significant amount of cell inhibition was observed when
LIPUS was used in the presence of 3.5 mT SMF (L + M3.5) at all culture
durations, and with 150 mT SMF (L + M), further inhibition in HCT116
cells was achieved. Almost 80% cell inhibition was observed after
72 h of incubation with L + M, as shown in Figure 2a. A similar inhibition was exhibited by
HepG2 cells under these treatment conditions (Figure 2d). The LIPUS treatment resulted in 5–20%
inhibition in these cells, which was increased to 50 and 70% in the
presence of 3.5 mT SMF (L + M3.5) and 150 mT SMF (L + M) at 72 h culture
duration, respectively. Since both cell lines (HCT116 and HepG2) showed
maximum inhibition with L + M treatment (30 mW/cm2 LIPUS
+ 150 mT SMF), more detailed experiments were performed using this
treatment. The influence of MT concentration on the viability of HCT116
and HepG2 cells is shown in Figure 2b,e, respectively. Form these dose response curves,
the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) concentration
of MT was determined to be 10.04 ng/mL for HCT116 cells (Figure 2b) and 36 μg/mL
for HepG2 cells (Figure 2e). Further experiments in the presence of MT drug were carried out
using the IC50 concentration of respective cell lines.

Proliferation assay of HepG2 under 15 min/day treatment of L + M when
the cells were exposed to MT and MT + MNP (p <

The influence of different treatment
conditions on the proliferation
of HCT116 cells is shown in Figure 2c. The cell proliferation decreased with culture duration
under all treatment conditions. However, the severity of cell inhibition
was highest with MT + MNP + L + M treatment. During the initial 24
h, the inhibition of HCT116 cells was 30% with the bare drug (MT),
which increased to 50% with L + M treatment (MT + L + M). Further
enhancement in the cellular inhibition (60%) was achieved with MT
+ MNP + L + M, where the drug was delivered using MNP. After 72 h
of culture, the MT + MNP + L + M treatment restricted the HCT116 cells
to ∼14%. Compared to MT, up to 30 and 36% increase in the cellular
inhibition were recorded with MT + L + M and MT + MNP + L + M treatments,
respectively, at 72 h culture. The differences in cell proliferation
were marginal between MT + L + M and MT + MNP + L + M.

The results
of similar proliferation assay experiments performed
with HepG2 cells are shown in Figure 2f. It appears that the bare drug (MT) is relatively
less effective in inhibiting HepG2 cells compared to HCT116 cells
(Figure 2c) during
the first 48 h of incubation, and at 72 h, both cells showed similar
amounts of proliferation. The L + M treatment was found to aid HepG2
cell inhibition in the presence of MT (MT + L + M). However, after
72 h incubation, the maximum proliferation of HepG2 cells (40%, Figure 2f) could not match
with HCT116 cells, which showed 20% under identical treatment conditions
(Figure 2c). The MT
+ MNP + L + M treatment showed strong influence on HepG2 cells with
17% proliferation at the end of 72 h culture, and these cells showed
relatively more inhibition during the first 48 h of culture compared
to HCT116 cells.

2.3 Effect of LIPUS + SMF Treatment
on Apoptosis
and Cell Cycle
The results of cell-cycle analysis performed
on two cancerous cell lines are presented in Figure 3. In both cell lines, the population of cells
in the S phase increased in the presence of anticancer drug (MT) compared
to the control group (Figure 3a,e), which is in line with the known blocking effect of MT
drug.51 The cell transition from the S
to G2 phase was found to be significantly reduced (>67%
of cells in the S phase, p < 0.05 in Figure 3c) with MT + L +
M treatment. No cells were observed in the G2 phase when HCT116 cells
were treated with MT + MNP + L + M, as shown in Figure 3d. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the
HepG2 cells are more sensitive to L + M treatment, as shown in Figure 3g–h. With
MT + L + M treatment, majority of the cells were restricted to the
G1 phase, followed by the S phase (Figure 3g). Interestingly, 100% cell blockage to
the G1 phase occurred in HepG2 cells with MT + MNP + L + M treatment.
These observations demonstrate that the efficiency of MT and MT +
MNP can be increased with LIPUS + SMF treatment, more effectively
in HepG2 cells than in HCT116 cells.

cell population in different phases after 72 h incubation (n = 6): (e) control (without MT); (f) MT-treated; (g) MT
+ L + M-treated; and (h) MT + MNP + L + M-treated.

The apoptosis assay of HCT116 shows 50% necrosis
in the presence
of MT (Figure 4b),
which is significantly higher than that of control samples (20%, Figure 4a). However, Figure 4c shows that the
cell response appears to be different when the MT was added in the
presence of L + M treatment (MT + L + M), where a significant reduction
in necrosis was observed. Moreover, the concentration of apoptotic
cells was also increased to 29% from 6% in MT treatment (Figure 4b). Interestingly,
when MT + MNP was administered along with L + M treatment (Figure 4d), the apoptosis
was further increased to 32%. The L + M treatment, with and without
MNP, along with MT gradually increased the cellular transition from
early to late apoptosis compared to bare MT. The response of HepG2
cells to these treatments was also found to be similar to HCT116 cells
(Figure 4e–g).
However, the amount of apoptotic and necrotic cells was high in HepG2
cells compared to HCT116 cells with MT + MNP + L + M treatment.

2.4 Intracellular ROS and Membrane Potential Changes
It is known that the oxidative stress, which is related to elevated
intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), can damage
cell structure, DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to cell death.
Therefore, we have measured the oxidative stress generated under different
treatment conditions in terms of ROS. As the ROS production can be
directly related to the damage of the cellular structure, DNA, and
proteins/lipids, the amount of ROS production in HCT116 and HepG2
cells was measured under different conditions. The results presented
in Figure 5a indicate
that the ROS intensity increased (164%) from 75 to 198 when the HCT116
cells were treated with MT and the intensity drastically increased
to 695 with L + M treatment, almost 250% increase in the ROS production.
Further increase in the intensity up to 763 was recorded with MT +
MNP + L + M treatment. In case of HepG2 cells, the ROS intensity increased
gradually from 491 for MT to about 1981 for MT + MNP + L + M treatment
(Figure 5b). Compared
to HCT116 cells, the MT + L + M and MT + MNP + L + M treatments resulted
in 95 and 160% more ROS production in HepG2 cells, respectively.

(b) HepG2 cells treated with MT, MT + L + M, and MT + MNP + L + M.
The control group had no treatment.

The change in the cell membrane potential of HCT116 cells
under
different treatment conditions is shown in Figure 6a, where the peaks of treated cells shifted
toward left, compared to the control group, indicating that they are
hyperpolarized. Hyperpolarization can result in increased transmembrane
transport of several ions, followed by cell death.52−54 The severity
of hyperpolarization was found to be maximum in HCT116 cells with
MT + MNP + L + M treatment. HepG2 cells exhibited more gradual increase
in the hyperpolarization with MT, MT + L + M, and MT + MNP + L + M
treatment, as shown in Figure 6b. Maximum hyperpolarization was achieved with MT + MNP +
L + M treatment, followed by MT + L + M and minimum with MT treatment.

cells.

2.5 Fluorescence
Microscopy
The initiation
of changes in the nucleus of HCT116 and HepG2 cells due to L + M treatment
was observed using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining
after 24 h culture. The morphology of DAPI-stained cell nuclei is
presented in Figure 7a. It was observed that the MT-treated cells showed relatively more
chromatin condensation in HCT116 cells compared to HepG2 cells, indicating
better effect of anticancer drug on HCT116 in terms of apoptosis,
as chromatin condensation is the primary indication of apoptosis.
Chromatin condensation was prominent in both cells under MT + L +
M treatment. Finally, the MT + MNP + L + M treatment appears to induce
complete protein denaturization and nucleus damage in both HCT116
and HepG2 cells at 72 h incubation. The degree of nucleus damage was
quantified by analyzing the nucleus intensity of fluorescence images
using ImageJ software and compared with that of control group.55 The results, shown in Figure 7b, revealed almost fourfold increase in the
damage of HCT116 cells after MT + MNP + L + M treatment. Similarly,
in HepG2 cells, the maximum cellular damage (3.71-fold) was achieved
with MT + MNP + L + M treatment. The morphology and features of cell
nucleus show damaged cell nucleus, which is an indication of apoptosis56 that can directly induce cellular inhibition
and thus provide overall improvement in the treatment efficacy.

2.6 Influence of LIPUS + SMF Treatment on Healthy
Cells
The proposed L + M treatment was found to have a strong
influence on cancer cell proliferation, as shown in Figure 2, but the potential negative
effect of this treatment on normal/healthy cells is not known. Therefore,
a similar cell proliferation assay was performed on MC3T3 (mouse pre-osteoblast)
cells. The results (Figure 8) show that only LIPUS (L: 30 mW/cm2) had very
little inhibiting effect on the proliferation during the initial 24
h and the proliferation increased significantly after 48 and 72 h
culture. The SMF (M: 150 mT) enhanced the cell proliferation at all
culture durations. The L + M treatment had a maximum positive influence
on MC3T3 cell proliferation, demonstrating its nontoxic effect on
healthy cells.

samples).

3 Discussion
In spite of significant research on DDS-based cancer treatment,
its limitations, such as poor stability, reunion of nanosized DDS
due to high surface area, limitation in target-site specificity for
accumulation and delivery of effective biomolecules, high cost due
to complex synthesis procedures, and poor invasiveness into tumor
microenvironment, result in low treatment efficiency.57−59 Therefore, newer adjuvant therapies that can enhance the overall
efficiency of the current DDS are required. The present MT + MNP-based
DDS with diffusion-controlled drug release at physiological pH shows
acceptable conditions of release environment.60 In this investigation, with the use of 30 mW/cm2 LIPUS
in the presence of 150 mT SMF (L + M), 15 min/day, the in vitro DDS
inhibition effectiveness has been enhanced by 35% in colon (HCT 116)
and hepatocellular (HepG2) carcinoma cells after 72 h incubation.
The use of L + M treatment can generate a noninvasive synergy between
the mechanical stress generated by LIPUS61 and local electrical fields22 generated
by combinational exposure of LIPUS and SMF, which are believed to
alter the activities of these cells by hyperpolarizing the cell membrane,41 and production of large amounts of ROS resulting
in observed cellular inhibition. As the cancer cells are known for
their rapid proliferation assisted by their depolarized cellular membrane,62 the LIPUS + SMF treatment-induced hyperpolarization
destabilized the cell structure and increased the cellular apoptosis.
The hyperpolarization of the cellular membrane results in an intra-
and extracellular ionic imbalance of cancer cells via increased intake
of anticancer drug (MT) or drug-loaded MNP (MT + MNP). Hyperpolarization
via MT and MT + MNP internalization after exposure to LIPUS + SMF
indicate a potential release of K+ ions from cell interior
or ingress of more Cl– ions into the cells, leading
to changes in the ionic gradient across the cell membrane. This imbalance
of ionic flow changes the cell membrane permeability,54 which directly leads to alteration of cellular conformation
as well as restrict the DNA synthesis of cancer cells. Furthermore,
the significantly high production of ROS in HepG2 cells compared to
HCT116 cells clearly indicates that the treatment has varying influence
depending on the cell type and therefore the treatment conditions
must be optimized to treat different cancer types. The differences
in treatment responses by different cells could be attributed to the
variations in their characteristics, such as cell membrane potential.63

The cell-cycle restriction (blockage in
the S phase or G1 →
S phase transition) increased significantly due to the application
of LIPUS + SMF in the presence of MT + MNP (no cells in the G2 phase for HCT116 and no cells in the S and G2 phases
for HepG2). These results suggest that the L + M treatment creates
hindrance in DNA synthesis, leading to cell-cycle arrest as a result
of altered/destabilized cell membrane potential and enhanced intake
of MT and MT + MNP by the cancer cells. Further, cell apoptosis analysis
demonstrates that LIPUS + SMF treatment can accelerate the cellular
activities of HCT116 and HepG2 cells, which is evinced by increase
in the apoptotic cells (46% for HepG2 cells and 33% for HCT116 cells).
A significant increase in the late apoptotic cell population of HepG2
cells (35%) also signifies loss of plasma membrane integrity and DNA
fragmentation in these cells. Necrosis is caused by factors external
to the cell or tissue, such as infection, toxins, or trauma, which
result in the unregulated digestion of cell components. In contrast,
apoptosis is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of
cellular death. One important finding in this analysis has been considerable
reduction in necrosis of cells with L + M treatment. It is generally
considered that necrosis is unprogrammed cell death and therefore
detrimental to the biological system. Although late apoptotic and
necrotic cells have permeabilized cell membranes, due to different
events associated with their membrane damage, their response to clearance/removal
signals would be different. Therefore, removal of necrotic cells from
the system would be relatively more difficult than apoptotic cells.64 The decrease in necrosis with L + M treatment
is thus beneficial for cancer treatment with potentially low side
effects. It is also evident that the synergetic effect of LIPUS +
SMF treatment resulted in overproduction of ROS in both cell lines.
The interaction of LIPUS + SMF treatment with polar and charged ionic
elements of cells produced large amounts of ROS, which is a proinflammatory
factor of cellular component responsible for cancer cell apoptosis.22,56,65 Excessive production of ROS damages
the DNA of cancer cells through the Fenton reaction23 and results in oxidative stress accelerating apoptosis.
It has been observed that the ion channels of cancer cells are damaged
leading to changes in their morphology and apoptosis due to excessive
ROS production.23

We hypothesize
that application of 30 mW/cm2 LIPUS +
150 mT SMF can generate electrical and mechanical stimuli in situ
during the treatment,22,42 which are believed to be responsible
for the observed enhancement in cancer cell inhibition with this treatment.
Under present experimental conditions, the mechanical stimulus generated
by LIPUS at the cell/soft tissue was estimated (, where p is the effective
pressure (Pa), I is the intensity of ultrasound (W/cm2), and Z is the acoustic impedance of the
cell or soft tissue (kg/(m2 s))) to be between 20 and 22
kPa. The estimated electrical field (E) (, where C is the velocity
of light (m/s), B is the magnetic field strength
(G); E is measured in electrostatic units esu (1
esu = 300 V/cm)) would be between 19 and 23 μV/cm. These in
situ generated physical stimuli would have physically deformed (elastic
or plastic) the cells/tissues, which can be seen from the hyperpolarization
of the cell membranes. The intake of drug can be increased with the
potential formation of stomas or lacunars in the cell membranes due
to mechanical stress generated via LIPUS.66−68 Moreover, the
pressure induced by LIPUS has been demonstrated to induce ∼50
μm/s micromotions in the tissues,69 which is believed to affect the membrane stability. As with externally
applied electrical fields,70 the in situ
generated electrical fields, although small, would have negatively
regulated the cancer cellular activities.40 Interestingly, the L + M treatment was demonstrated to be safe for
healthy cells (MC3T3) presumably due to differences in cell characteristics
between cancer and healthy cells. However, toxicity due to the accumulation
of these MNP is an important concern, which can be reduced by guiding
the MNP using focused magnetic fields.16 Another approach for targeting MNP with minimal accumulation involves
functionalization of these NPs with tissue-specific adhesion molecules
(homing receptors).71,72 These two approaches are to be
examined in conjunction with current LIPUS + SMF treatment to realize
the full potential of this noninvasive treatment.

4 Conclusions
Detailed in vitro experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed
noninvasive LIPUS + SMF treatment can stimulate cancer cell inhibition
three times better than bare drug or DDS. The treatment appears to
be relatively more effective for early-time inhibition of HepG2 cells
than HCT116 cells in the presence of MT + MNP. The production of ROS
is also higher in HepG2 cells than in HCT116 cells. The treatment
significantly reduced the amount of necrosis and induced hyperpolarization
in both cancer cell lines. The in situ generated mechanical and electrical
stimuli are thought to be responsible for the observed increase in
cancer cellular inhibition via altered cell membrane characteristics.
Since the treatment did not have any inhibitory effect on healthy
cells, it is believed to have strong application potential to inhibit
a variety of other cancer cell lines. The present in vitro results
can form the basis for further investigations including targeting
specific tissues, using homing molecule functionalized MNP and magnetic
guidance, and in vivo trials to assess the effectiveness of this treatment.

5 Materials and Methods
Deionized and decarbonized ultrapure
water (Millipore, specific
resistivity: 18 MΩ, conductivity: 0.05 μS/cm) was used
in all preparations, and the chemicals used in this study were Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.0%, Merck), NH2OH (99.0%, Merck), urea (99.0%, Merck), NH4OH (99.5%,
Sigma-Aldrich), and methotrexate (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich).

5.1 Synthesis and Characterization of MNP (α-Fe2O3)- and Methotrexate-Loaded MNP (MT + MNP)
Fe2O3 nanoparticles (MNP) were synthesized
following precipitation route using ammonia and urea. In a typical
synthesis, 20 cc of ammonia solution (25%) was added dropwise to 20
cc of 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O solution
at 90 °C and stirred for 1 h. A fine precipitate was obtained,
which was filtered and washed three times with deionized water. Then,
the water was removed with acetone (dehydrating agent), followed by
overnight drying of the precipitate at 60 °C and calcination
at 450 °C for 2 h. Since the primary focus of this investigation
has been to evaluate the influence of LIPUS + SMF treatment on cancer
cell inhibition, we have intentionally used weak ferromagnetic/paramagnetic
nanoparticles to eliminate or reduce the accumulation of MNP during
this treatment. Further, the use of magnetic field is to generate
the proposed electrical field/charge noninvasively in the presence
of LIPUS. In fact, in our earlier investigation, we have used nonmagnetic
NPs to evaluate the influence of LIPUS + SMF treatment,73 and in this investigation, we attempted to analyze
the effect of magnetic carriers.

For anticancer drug loading,
1 g of calcined MNP was suspended in 5 cc of ethanol with 1 g of methotrexate
(MT) and the solution was sonicated for 15 min. The prepared solution
was aged overnight to evaporate the ethanol and obtain drug-loaded
MNP (MT + MNP). For drug release study, 30 mg of MT + MNP was dispersed
in 30 mL of freshly prepared PBS (pH 7.4) and was used as the analyte.
Then, at specific time intervals, an aliquot of 3 mL was removed from
the main stock and the optical density was determined using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer). Initially, a calibration
curve was prepared to calculate the concentration of drug released
into PBS at specific incubation time.

Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis of MNP was performed using
an X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, the
Netherlands) in the 2θ range between 5 and 70°. The particle
size of MNP and MT + MNP was measured by dynamic light scattering
(Malvern, Germany) using dilute suspensions of powder in water. The
ζ potential was determined using a Zetasizer (Zetasizer 2000,
Malvern, Germany) with a dilute suspension of the powder in PBS having
pH 7.4. The morphology of MNP and MT + MNP was studied using a transmission
electron microscope (TECHNAI G2 30ST, and FEI). To identify the absorption
bands of MT in MT + MNP, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
of the powder was recorded at room temperature using the KBr (Sigma-Aldrich,
≥99%) pellet method (sample: KBr = 1:100) using a spectrophotometer
(Spectrum100, PerkinElmer) in the 400–4000 cm–1 range with an average of 50 scans. The magnetic properties of the
powder (∼0.2 g) were determined using a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM, LakeShore7407) under a maximum field of 15 kOe at room temperature.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA)–differential thermal analysis
(DTA) of the powder were carried out between 25 and 1000 °C at
a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air to estimate the absorption
of MT on MNP using a TGA/DTA instrument (NETZSCH STA 409 CD, Germany).

5.2 Cytotoxicity Assay
5.2.1 Cell
Culture and IC50 of MT
Human colon carcinoma (HCT116)
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2)
(ATCC, Rockville, MD) cells were routinely cultured separately in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
1 U/mL penicillin G, and 1 mg/mL streptomycin, in a T75 flask in a CO2 incubator (ESCO, Singapore) at 37 °C
with 5% CO2. It was distributed using a six-well plate
after full confluency. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MT was evaluated at various concentrations in the range
of 5–100 ng/mL with 10 mg/mL MT stock solution in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, India). After the cells were plated
at 2 × 104/well density, they were incubated at 37
°C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h to allow cell adhesion
and the incubation was continued for a total duration of 72 h after
the addition of MT (n = 3). After 72 h incubation,
the MTT assay was performed by adding 10 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-phenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reagent with a concentration of 1 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich)
in a 1:9 ratio (MTT/DMEM) to all wells and incubated in the dark for
4 h at 37 °C. Then, the solution was removed and 100 μL
of DMSO was added to each well. The absorbance of the solution was
measured at 550 nm in an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad) to generate the dose
response curve. The IC50 was determined from the dose response
curve.

5.2.2 Cell Proliferation Assay
Both HCT116
and HepG2 cells were subcultured in 35 mm Petri plates at a density
of 2 × 104 and incubated overnight. Then, MT or MT
+ MNP was added at desired concentrations (MT at IC50 concentration
for each cell line and MNP including MT at 46 μg/mL for HCT116
and 73 μg/mL for HepG2), followed by exposure to 3.5 and 150
mT SMF (⌀ 30 mm, 5–6 mm thick NdFeB permanent magnets)
and LIPUS (probe ⌀ 22.22 mm, 30 mW/cm2, 1.5 MHz,
200 μs pulse width at 1 kHz). The treatment (LIPUS + SMF) time
was 15 min/day, and the MTT assay was performed after 24, 48, and
72 h incubation. A similar proliferation assay was also carried out
using mouse pre-osteoblast cells (MC3T3) (ATCC, Rockville, MD) to
assess the effect of LIPUS + SMF treatment on these healthy cells.
The details of sample notations used in the present investigation
are presented in Table 1.

5.3 Apoptosis and Cell-Cycle
Analysis
To analyze the influence of different treatments
on the cellular
activities of HCT116 and HepG2 cells, cell-cycle analysis was performed
using Cycletest PLUS DNA reagent kit (BD Cat no: 340242). The amount
of cell apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining
kit (BD Biosciences, Cat no: 556570). For the analysis, 1 × 105 treated cells were trypsinized and washed with 1× PBS
and the suspended pellet was analyzed using a flow cytometer (CyFlow
Cube 6, SysmexPartec GmbH, Germany). Both analyses were performed
after 72 h culture duration.

5.4 Measurement of Reactive
Oxygen Species (ROS)
and Cell Membrane Potential
After desired treatment, the
cells (1 × 105) were trypsinized, washed with 1×
PBS, and resuspended in 1 mL of 1× PBS to detect ROS using standard
detection assay kit (ab186029, Abcam, India). The intensity of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin
diacetate was detected using a flow cytometer at 650 nm. Plasma membrane
potential changes were measured using bis(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethineoxonol
(DiBAC4(3) dye; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To measure the
membrane potential, trypsinized cells were incubated in 100 nM DiBAC4(3) dye for 10 min in the dark and then the mean fluorescence
intensity was measured using a flow cytometer at 488 nm.

5.5 Fluorescence Microscopy
Qualitative
analysis of treated cancer cells in terms of their nucleus and nuclear
membrane structures was carried out by DAPI (Cat no: D1306, Thermo
Fisher) staining. The cells were plated
at a density of 3 × 103 in a 35 mm Petri plate. After
desired culture duration (72 h), the cells were rinsed with PBS three
times, followed by fixing for 10 min in 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells
were permeabilized by immersing in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and
incubating the cells for 1–5 min at room temperature in diluted
DAPI solution (1:5000). After aspirating the labeled solution, the
cells were rinsed three times in PBS. Counter-staining was performed
by adding 2.5 μg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate to each well
and kept for 5 min and then washed three times using PBS. Finally,
the cells were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51TRF,
Tokyo, Japan).

5.6 Statistical Analysis
The data obtained
in cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, cell cycle, ROS, and membrane
potential measurements were statistically analyzed using the Student t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
