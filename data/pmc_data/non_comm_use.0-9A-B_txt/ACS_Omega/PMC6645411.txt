Excess
proton structures in water remain unclear. The motion and
nature of excess protons in water were probed using a supported water
bridge structure in electric field (E) with an intensity
of ∼106 V/m. The experimental setup generated protons
that exhibit a long lifetime. The effect of excess protons in water
induced a ∼3% variation in the pH for a 300 V overvoltage at
the cathode. The current versus voltage curves show a current space-charge-limited
operation. By measuring the space-charge distribution in both the
cathode and anode and by adjusting the Mott–Gurney law to the
measured excess hydrated proton current and the voltage drop in the
cationic space-charge region, the protonic mobility was determined
to be ∼200 × 10–8 m2/(V·s)
(E ≈ 4 × 106 V/m). This measured
mobility, which is typically five times larger than the reported mobility
for protons in water, is in agreement with the mechanism outlined
by Grotthuss in 1805. The measured mid-Raman spectrum covering 1000–3800
cm–1 range indicates the species character. The
hydrated excess proton spectral response through the mid-Raman at
1760 and 3200 cm–1 was attributed to the Zundel
complex and the region at ∼2000 to ∼2600 cm–1 response is attributed to the Eigen complex, indicating a core structure
simultaneously with a Eigen-like and Zundel-like character, suggesting
a rapid fluctuation between these two structures or a new specie.

Introduction
In aqueous systems, transport of excess
hydrated protons plays
an important role in many chemical and biochemical processes.1 The large range of the measured vibrational energy
of the observed hydrated proton arises from the large polarizability
within the cation associated with the attraction of a bare proton
to a water molecule. The surrounding water molecules fluctuating electric
fields have a large effect on the proton vibrational levels, producing
a continuum.2 The structural question related
to the mechanism of the anomalously high mobility of protons in water
has provided inspiration for various theories.3 The hydrated proton picture was defined in the 1960s by Eigen,4 who suggested a large complex H9O4+ arrangement. There has been a contrasting view
that the hydrated proton is in fact H5O2+, the Zundel cation.4 Important
pieces of evidence for the presence of these species have been found
in the Raman spectra observed in our recent work.5 Experimental results correlating the Raman continuum frequencies
to the Eigen and Zundel structures in the liquid phase are missing;6 therefore, we performed Raman spectroscopy to
characterize the protonated water species in liquid water. Gas-phase
studies of protonated water clusters,7−9 molecular dynamics simulations,10−13 and ab initio calculations14 have been
recently performed.

Recent calculations15 using thousands
of proton–water clusters were used to obtain a vibrational
density of states and the infrared (IR) spectral density. They find
that there is a wide distribution of vibrational frequencies within
the region of 2000–2600 cm–1 for every local
proton configuration mostly associated with the Eigen-like configuration.
Local hydrogen-bonding structure and dynamics of aqueous systems have
been probed by IR spectroscopy but remains difficult to assign.

Although the formation of a floating water bridge has been known
for over 100 years,16−18 it was recently rediscussed by Fuchs et al.,19 in this work another configuration forming a
supported water bridge is used to measure the motion of the excess
protons. The preferential molecular orientations appear to be quite
weak as demonstrated by the two-dimensional neutron diffraction studies
of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) liquid bridges20 in the bulk, but the emergence of a proton interfacial layer anchors
a collective vibrational mode.21 This behavior
has already been observed in the ultrafast energy relaxation mechanism.22,23

Here, we report on the transport of excess protons in high
electric
fields. The process displays many unique characteristics because of
the net positive charge defect that an excess proton creates,18,20,24,25 and the large vibrational Raman spectrum is presented as evidence
for the presence of hydrated protons.

Raman spectrum of a floating
water bridge covering 1000–3800
cm–1 range was measured. It is then possible in
these measurements to clearly isolate the spectrum of the H(aq)+ cation from that of water solvent. In our previous work5 using floating water bridge arrangements where
excess protons were present, the interfacial region showed the presence
of both Zundel and Eigen species identified using the calculated spectra
of Marx.1 The measured Raman spectrum partially
matches the addition of the two spectra (Zundel and Eigen). However,
recently, Stoyanov et al.26 showed that
the structure of H+(H2O)n in liquid water is inconsistent with IR data, which they claim
is associated with the O···O bond elongation, indicating
ion pairing formed by cations such as Eigen H3O·3H2O+ or Zundel H5O2+ ions.

The space-charge distribution in highly purified water
was previously
investigated by Zahn and Takada.27 These
authors used high-voltage electro-optic mapping that showed a field
distortion because of excess charges and claimed that the effect may
in part be due to electrodynamic convection, as observed for the parallel
planes of ∼3 cm wide and ∼100 cm long electrodes. This
convection was not explicitly considered in their analysis. Zahn and
Takada27 also defined a temperature-dependent
“proton mobility” for pure water by μ = μ0(1 + at), where μ0 is the
proton mobility at 0 °C [24.9 × 10–8 m2/(V·s)], a is an ion-specific constant,
equal to 1.83 × 10–3/°C, and t is the temperature in °C. Other reports have claimed that when
high voltages are applied to liquids, an anomalously high “charge
mobility” can be produced by EHD forces.28 Recently, Ostroumov,29 Stuetzer,30 and Felici31 equated
the kinetic energy change in an electrohydrodynamically stressed liquid
to the electrostatic energy change. More recently, Fuchs et al.32 calculated the mobility using this relation
and the measured velocity in the water floating bridge using laser
velocimetry.

Experimental Section
Space-Charge Distribution
Measurements
Some of the
essential features of the present experiment, in which horizontal
water bridges were formed under high applied electric fields (∼106 V/m),33 are as follows: the supported
bridge apparatus consisted of two beakers with attached capillaries,
as shown in Figure 1. A bridge was formed between two glass capillaries with an internal
diameter of 2 mm. The beakers were placed to ensure that the capillary
tubes were aligned and in contact with one another in a three-dimensional
translational stage by applying a high voltage between two platinum
wire electrodes, with their lateral surfaces isolated and immersed
in the liquid inside each beaker the bridge is formed. Two high-voltage
dc power supplies were employed. The first supply produced a positive
output voltage (Vmax ≈ 25 kV) depicted
as configuration (a) in Figure 1, and the second supply generated a negative high voltage
(Vmax ≈ −25 kV) shown as
configuration (b). The negative terminal was grounded when using the
positive power supply and the positive terminal was grounded when
using the negative voltage power supply, as shown in Figure 1. The current source was formed
by the power supplies in series with the high internal fluid resistance
in the beakers. An analog voltmeter (SK-100, ICEL-KAISE, Brazil) was
also used. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C in the two
beakers containing Milli-Q water (18 MΩ·cm) by using a
low current of ∼50 μA; for operation at 35 °C, a
bridge current of ∼100 μA was responsible for the temperature
increase.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the circuit used to measure the space-charge
region at the cathode indicated by circuit (a) and at the anode indicated
by (b). Two power supplies were used: in configuration (a), the cathode
is grounded, and in configuration (b), the anode is grounded.

The “floating water bridge”
experiment was designed
to better understand the interaction between water and the high electric
fields produced by a high-voltage (20 kV) point electrode system.
A floating water bridge forms when a high potential difference (kV/cm)
is applied between two capillaries forming a free hanging water string
through air connecting the two capillaries, Sir William Armstrong
first reported this experiment in 1893.16

Vibrational Raman Spectroscopy Measurements
For our
measurements of the vibrational Raman lines of water immersed in an
electric field, we constructed a special setup consisting of a confocal
Raman microscope (CRM), and the arrangement is shown in Figure 2. In this setup, water is submitted
to an electric field (E ≈ 106 V/m)
using the high-voltage point electrode system. The inhomogeneous electric
field was produced using two Pt wire electrodes (Ø = 1 mm) forming a two-point electrode geometry. Milli-Q grade purified
water (18.2 MΩ) was filled into a glass beaker (Ø = 18 mm, h = 16 mm), which was then placed in between the electrodes. Two Pt electrodes
were embedded in an insulating poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) cylindrical
block (Ø = 35 mm, h = 18 mm)
and connected to the high-voltage output of a dc power supply. A rigid
PTFE constructed armature affixed the electrodes. Twenty milliliters
of water was used for each measurement; this quantity brought the
liquid surface to an ∼1 mm height above the top of the electrode
surface, separated by ∼3 mm. The water was subjected to an
electric field (E ≈ 106 V/m) using
the high-voltage (3 kV) point electrode system, and the vibrational
Raman mode spectrum was measured.

Figure 2 Schematic diagram of the apparatus used
to measure the Raman spectra
of water for various applied voltages to the Pt wire electrodes. The
interfacial water structure was probed at the region between the electrodes.

The vibrational modes of water
are Raman-active and can be accessed
using a low-power laser. The Raman spectra of the water bridge structure
were measured by passing a laser beam vertically down through the
water surface and detecting the reflected scattering signal. The Raman
spectra were recorded using a commercial CRM (CRM200, WiTec, Germany).
A microscope objective Nikon lens (10×/0.25) with a focal length
of 7 cm produced a 50 μm spot size radius on the water surface.
The radiation spot was focused on the top surface by slowly focusing
the microscope up and down and maximizing the detected signal. Excitation
was accomplished with an argon-ion laser operating at 514 nm with
∼15 mW of plane-polarized radiation. The output beams were
focused down and coupled to a monomode fiber. The output beam of the
fiber was unpolarized radiation. Various spectra were recorded by
changing the beam focus and the laser intensity.

Results and Discussion
The measured electrical characteristic of the water bridge is determined
by mechanisms limiting the current in the bridge. The current versus
voltage curves were measured for the supported liquid bridge that
was formed when two glass capillaries were in contact; the two capillary
tubes were then separated, and the open-circuit potential was measured
to be V = VS, with I = 0. In this sequence, the tubes were first placed in
contact so that V = 0 and I = IS = VS/R, where R is the total liquid resistance from the
cathode to the anode. An increase in the voltage should induce a parallel
shift in this line while maintaining the same slope −R. However, for potentials higher than ∼3 kV, the
slope R decreases. This effect is illustrated in Figure 3, which compares
the slope for an ∼2–3 kV potential (dashed line), which
corresponds to the low-voltage case, with the slope for a 13 kV potential
(solid line). There is a decrease in the bridge resistance with increasing
voltage, from ∼295 × 106 Ω at 3.5 kV
to ∼175 × 106 Ω at 13 kV, which is associated
with a new dissociation process. The measured resistance at low voltages
(<3 kV) is independent of the voltage and corresponds to the resistance
of the water volume in the region between the cathode and anode electrodes.
The electrodes are understood to be collecting and injecting electrons
at the same rate, resulting in a reduction and oxidation balance occurring
at the cathode and anode, respectively.

Figure 3 Applied voltage vs current
curve measured using a supported bridge
arrangement formed by two capillaries in contact. The open voltage
is given by the intersection of the straight line with the vertical
axis, and the short-circuit current is given by the intersection with
the horizontal axis. The slope of the line for the high voltage is
less than that for the low voltage. The low-voltage slope, corresponding
to Vi = 3.5 kV, is indicated by a dashed
line; for higher applied voltages: 5, 8.2, 10, and 13 kV, the slope
is indicated by full lines. The measured values are indicated by ■.
The inset shows the high-voltage dissociation current vs applied voltage
by ▲ and the thermal carriers (OH– and H+) by ●.

In the inset of Figure 3, the high-voltage dissociation current at a given
applied
voltage was calculated by subtracting from the measured current, given
in Figure 3, by the
intersection of the solid line at the same applied voltage with the
horizontal axis, the value indicated by the intersection of the dashed
line, which corresponds to the slope measured for an applied voltage
of 3 kV.

This new current component depicted in Figure 4 for various temperatures shows
the same
behavior as a space-charge-limited current operation, that is, a current
proportional to the square of the applied voltage, which is expressed
by the Mott–Gurney law derived in connection with current conduction
in semiconductors and insulators.34 The
space charge then controls the dissociation current amplitude and
specifies the maximum current that can be collected at a given voltage.34 Each curve in Figure 4 represents an independent measurement performed
at 25 or 35 °C. The curves indicated by ○, ▲, and
■ were adjusted to the Mott–Gurney equation and correspond
to a maximum applied voltage of 13 kV measured at 25 °C, whereas
the curve indicated by ● was measured at 35 °C with an
applied voltage up to 16 kV. The adjusted Mott–Gurney expression
is given by I = JA = I0(V – V0)2, where J is the current density, A is the electrode area, and the I0 and V0 values were determined
by the fitting of the current expression to the experimental data.
The calculated value of I0 is 0.31 ±
0.04 for water bridges operated at 25 °C, and I0 is ∼0.63 for water bridges operated at 35 °C,
both with V0 = (3.75 ± 0.05) ×
103. The dissociation current then shows a space-charge-limited
operation, but because the water resistivity is 18 MΩ·cm,
the dominant voltage drop in the bridge is Ohmic. To determine the
components along the bridge structure associated with each contribution,
that is, the Ohmic voltage and the space-charge potential drop, the
voltage versus distance profiles at the electrodes were measured.

Figure 4 Excess
protonic current vs voltage curves for bridges operated
at 25 °C indicated by ○, ▲, and ■ and at
35 °C indicated by ●. The solid line is the fit to an
expression of the Mott–Gurney law I = JA = I0(V – V0)2, where I is
the high-voltage dissociation current, J is the current
density, A is the electrode area, and I0 and V0 were determined by
the fitting to the experimental data.

Two configurations with three electrodes (anode, cathode,
and probe
electrode indicated by ▶) were used to measure the potential
distribution close to the electrodes, as shown schematically in the
insets of Figures 5 and 6. The cathode spatial electrode distribution
is shown in the inset of Figure 5. The probe electrode is grounded, so voltages could
be measured up to 1000 V using a standard voltmeter. To probe the
anode electrode voltage distribution, a negative high-voltage power
supply was used and the anode electrode was grounded, as shown in
the inset of Figure 6. The measured spatial distribution of the potential in the anode
region is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 5 Cathode spatial voltage distribution as a function of the distance
(d) to the electrode for various applied voltages
(6.5, 8, 11, and 13 kV). A schematic diagram of the three-electrode
measurement configuration is indicated in the lower inset; up to a
distance of ∼1 mm from the cathode, there is an electric field
of ∼4 × 106 V/m, resulting in a voltage drop
of ∼300 V (Vappl = 13 kV).

Figure 6 Anode spatial voltage distribution as a function
of the distance
(d) to the electrode for 13 kV applied voltage. A
linear dependence of the voltage vs distance indicates an Ohmic drop
component. The top inset shows the schematic diagram of the three-electrode
configuration.

The measured spatial
distributions of the potential in the cathode
region are shown in Figure 5. Four spatial variations in the potential at the cathode
surface are shown for various applied voltages (6.5, 8, 11, and 13
kV). There is a steady-state net positive space-charge layer that
has a width of ∼0.8 × 10–4 m at the
cathode region for a voltage drop of ∼300 V and an applied
voltage of 13 kV. At the anode, there is no measurable space-charge
region and the voltage profile only shows an IR component that increases
linearly with the distance to the electrode.

The cathode fall
region profile in high electric fields in a supported
water bridge shows a net positive charge. While passing through the
charged sheath, the excess protons show a current that is both mobility-limited
and space-charge-limited.27 These measured
space-charge arrangements correspond to a steady-state distribution,
while Zahn and Takada27 have reported on
a time-dependent charge arrangement. These authors showed that there
is a space-charge region from excess charges at the anode that propagates
into the water volume and forms a positive space-charge region at
the cathode. Here, we have measured a low voltage drop at the positive
electrode and a high drop at the negative electrode, which indicates
a net positive space-charge distribution near the negative electrode
(see the measured profile in Figure 5) and a zero space-charge voltage drop at the anode
electrode (Figure 6). A unipolar drift of positive charges dominates the excess charge
conduction.

By combining Poisson’s equation and Maxwell’s
first
equation, we obtain an expression for the current density j, where V is the voltage across the space-charge
region, l is the space-charge region thickness, μ
is the charge carrier mobility, ϵ is the water dielectric constant,
and A is the electrode area. This expression corresponds
to the Mott–Gurney law34 1  

The protonic mobility given
by eq 1 for a space-charge
layer thickness of ∼0.8
× 10–4 m and an electric field strength of
4 × 106 V/m is ∼200 × 10–8 m2/(V·s). This mobility is typically five times
larger than the reported mobility for protons in water35 and is larger than the proton mobility of 93
× 10–8 m2/(V·s) measured by
Fuchs32 for an average field strength of
3.5 × 105 V/m. This value is in agreement with our
previous work32 and others36 that have shown that these excess carriers are protons
and protons move very fast in water as they propagate according to
a mechanism outlined by De Grotthuss in 1805.37

The inset of Figure 3 shows a comparison of the excess proton current and the current
associated with thermally generated ions. The molecular dissociation
induced by the electric field current versus applied voltage is indicated
by ▲, and the current generated by the thermal carriers is
indicated by ●. The current associated with thermally dissociated
ions for an applied voltage of 13 kV is ∼50 μA, whereas
the current induced by the electric field is ∼35 μA.
At 25 °C, the equilibrium constant of water is calculated by
the product of the ion concentrations of [H3O+] and [OH–] and is equal to 10–14. The bracketed quantities are the concentrations in moles/liter.
At equilibrium, each ion has an equal concentration of ∼10–7 mol/L, and the background charge density of each
ion is ∼10 C/m3. The net charge density at the space-charge
region was then calculated and compared to the charge density of the
thermal carriers. In the previous paragraph, we calculated the excess
proton mobility for a 300 V space-charge voltage. Then, using the
calculated mobility and the dimensions of the space-charge volume,
where I is its thickness and A is
the area, we rewrite the expression of the injected current density
as ρ = (I·l)/(μ·V·A), where I is
the measured current and V is the space-charge voltage.
The calculated value for the injected space density is ρ = 0.333
C/m3. This value is an insignificant fraction of the ∼10
C/m3 background thermally generated charges. Using Avogadro’s
number (6.023 × 1023 molecules/mol) and the charge
per ion 1.602 × 10–19 C and converting cubic
meter to liters, a concentration of 3.3 × 10–19 mol/liter is obtained, and the thermally generated charge concentration
is 107 mol/liter. The value in the experimental setup reported
by Zahn and Takada25 is ∼2 C/m3, and the value measured by Sammer et al.38 is ΔpH ≈ 0.1. Here, for a 300 V potential
measured at the space-charge layer, there is an ∼3% variation
in the pH induced by the excess protons.

Hydrated Excess Proton
Raman Spectrum Measured in Floating Water
Bridges
Sequential hop of an excess proton from one solvating
water molecule to the next resulting in a high mobility, as reported
in the previous paragraph, is the accepted aqueous proton-transfer
mechanism, known as the Grotthuss mechanism.3 However, if the structure resembles the Eigen complex, H9O4+ or the Zundel complex, H5O2+ is still an open question. To help answer this
question, an experiment that can identify these configurations in
the liquid phase was performed such as measuring Raman vibrational
spectrum of the excess hydrated proton species.

IR spectroscopy
has proven to be particularly valuable for studying this phenomenon
because of its sensitivity to hydrogen bonding. In strong acid solutions,
the aqueous proton shows a continuum IR absorption spanning from <1000
to >3000 cm–1.39 Historically,
analysis and discussion of the acid IR continuum and proton transport
dynamics continue to be centered on two limiting structures: the H5O2+ Zundel ion and the solvated hydronium
Eigen complex [H3O + (H2O)3].40,41

Other studies by applying IR techniques to H+(H2O)n in liquid water concluded
that the structure of H+(H2O)n in liquid water is inconsistent with new IR and X-ray data26 and indicate a more extensive delocalization
of positive charge in liquid water and that neither traditional Eigen
nor Zundel structures are consistent with the data. Ion pairing is
also more prevalent than previously believed.

As the mid-Raman
spectrum of the bulk aqueous acid is too diffuse6 to establish the roles of the Eigen (H9O4+) and Zundel (H5O2+) ion cores, a water bridge structure was used to measure
the vibrational spectrum of the protonated water. Figure 7 shows the Raman spectrum indicated
by a dashed line for water when the applied voltage was turned OFF.
The spectrum for an applied voltage of 3 kV (E ≈
106 V/m) is shown by the full line. In Figure 8, the difference between these
two spectra is plotted. Following subtraction of the neat water spectrum,
two distinct features are observed as an intense and large peak at
2250 cm–1 and a narrow peak at 3200 cm–1. The hydrated excess proton spectral response at 1760 and 3200 cm–1 was attributed to the Zundel complex and the region
from 2000 to 2600 cm–1 response to the Eigen-like
configuration.15

Figure 7 Raman spectra for water
in the bridge structure. The full line
indicates the spectrum for Vappl = 3 kV,
and the dashed line shows the spectrum for Vappl = 0 V. The 3 kV dc voltage applied between the two pointed
Pt electrodes (Ø ≈ 1 mm and separated
by 3 mm) results in an electric field intensity of ∼106 V/m.

Figure 8 Difference between the
floating water bridge spectrum and the water
spectrum shown in Figure 7. The resulting curve reflects the spectral Raman density
contributions of hydrated excess protons.

To further clarify the interfacial water protonic conduction
nature
in the water bridge structure, the physical states of water and ice
were compared by using their Raman vibrational spectra. The charge
transport and self-dissociation in ice crystals are very incomplete,41 associated with many of the measurement difficulties;
consequently, current versus voltage curves could not be obtained
with sufficient accuracy. Initially, the temperature of water was
decreased below the freezing point, and the ice modes were probed
for an applied voltage of 3 kV (E = 106 V/m); then, the temperature was increased to 20 °C and the
measurements were repeated. The measured spectral range from 1700
to 2800 cm–l is shown in Figure 9. The curves indicated by a dashed line show
spectrum at −4 °C and by full line at −6 °C,
observed at the top of the water surface where the electrodes are
placed. The probing of the ice/air interface using vibrational Raman
spectroscopy shows that the polymorphic ice at −4 and −6
°C does not present the broad vibrational band in the 1700–2800
cm–1 spectral region. The curves indicated by ○
correspond to the spectrum measured at 20 °C, and the curve indicated
by △ was measured at 10 °C. The excess hydrated proton
spectrum is clearly observed in liquid water. Therefore, apparently
when the interfacial water structure changes from liquid water to
ice, there is no formation of the structure observed in liquid.

Figure 9 Vibrational
Raman spectrum of water from 1700 to 2800 cm–1 measured
at 20 °C indicated by ○, at 10 °C by △,
at −4 °C by the dashed line, and at −6 °C
by the full line.

Our experiments on water
offer evidence for the presence of metastable
complexes in liquid water. The percentage of the Eigen and Zundel
complex in our experiment is determined by comparing the thermally
generated current of (I ≈ 50 μA), with
the current of the excess hydrated protons (I ≈
35 μA) shown in Figure 3. In principle, our current assignments indicate three separated
entities: the Eigen and Zundel cations and the thermally generated
carriers.

Conclusions
The excess charge mobility
was determined by measuring the I × V curves and the space-charge
region profiles in supported water bridges. The measured space-charge
profiles in Milli-Q water are not associated with the thermally ionized
species but are associated with the hydrated excess protons. The Mott–Gurney
equation was previously derived in connection with the conduction
in semiconductors. Here, we have observed a space charge at the cathode
electrode in liquid water for excess hydrated protons. For a 300 V
potential measured at the space-charge layer, there is only an ∼3%
variation in the pH induced by the excess protons. The measured mobility
of 200 × 10–8 m2/V·s for these
excess protons, which is typically five times larger than the reported
mobility for protons in water, is in agreement with the mobility of
hydrated protons that move fast in water because they propagate according
to a mechanism outlined by De Grotthuss in 1805.37 The measured Raman continuum frequency spectrum indicates
that the core structure has Eigen-like and Zundel-like characters,
suggesting a rapid fluctuation between these two structures or a new
specie.
