Composite poly(ether
sulfone) membranes integrated with ZnO nanostructures
either directly blended or grown in situ have enhanced antibacterial
activity with improved functionality in reducing the biofouling in
water treatment applications. The pore structure and surface properties
of the composite were studied to investigate the effect of the addition
of ZnO nanostructures. The hydrophilicity of the blended membranes
increased with a higher content of ZnO nanoparticles in the membrane
(2–6%), which could be further controlled by varying the growth
conditions of ZnO nanorods on the polymer surface. Improved water
flux, bovine serum albumin rejection, and inhibition of Escherichia coli bacterial growth under visible light
irradiation was observed for the membranes decorated with ZnO nanorods
compared to those in the membranes simply blended with ZnO nanoparticles.
No regrowth of E. coli was recorded
even 2 days after the incubation.

1 Introduction
The
membrane separation processes in water treatment is of global
interest to provide clean water for the growing population across
the world.1 Polymeric membranes are dominant
in conventional membrane desalination and water treatment applications.1 Among the variety of polymeric membranes that
are commercially available, poly(ether sulfone) (PES) membranes are
the preferred choice in water treatment plants because of their outstanding
thermal stability and mechanical properties.2,3 The
PES membranes find application in ultrafiltration, nanofiltration,
reverse osmosis, gas separation, and biomedical applications, among
others.4 PES (Figure 1) is an amorphous polymer consisting of phenylene
rings linked with sulfone groups (−SO2−)
or ether linkages (−O−), rendering the polymer chemically
resistant with a high glass-transition temperature (∼230 °C).2 However, PES is a moderately hydrophobic polymer,
resulting in the membrane being susceptible to biofouling and microbial
attacks.5

Figure 1 PES structure.

Biofouling of the PES membranes is caused by the deposition
of
natural organic matter, like humic acid, and/or by microorganisms,
such as bacteria and microalgae, at the membrane’s surface.6−10 For example, biofouling poses a serious obstacle for water treatment
and in desalination plants responsible for the reduction of rejection
and net water flux. Enhanced biofouling resistance of the PES membrane
has been demonstrated to be achieved by the modification of the PES
surfaces to avoid biofouling.8,9,11,12 To minimize the effect of biofouling,
feed solutions (especially feed water during desalination) are often
pretreated by a chlorination step.8,13,14 However, chlorination degrades the membrane integrity
upon frequent use, and the chlorine byproducts generated during the
treatment are often dangerous to human health and can contribute adversely
to the environment.15 Thus, there is a
strong need for membrane modification technologies to overcome the
biofouling problem and increase the membrane life time.

Many
researchers have been studying the effect of adding organic5,16−21 and inorganic22−28 modifiers to relieve the defects in the currently available membranes.29−31 These additives can be used as surface coatings19,21,22,28,32 or blended3,26,33,34 within the membrane structure.
Among the studied membrane modifiers, zinc oxide is considered to
be a promising candidate for the fabrication of functionalized composite
membranes.26,33,35−37 Zinc oxide is a semiconductor3 that has been widely used in photocatalytic water treatment38−40 to degrade organic pollutants and is known to inhibit the growth
of a wide range of microorganisms, such as bacteria Escherichia coli,6,17Bacillus subtilis6 fungi,41 and microalgae.42 Because of the hydrophilic nature of zinc oxide and its microbial
activities, it is a suitable material for preparing mixed matrix composite
membranes with a high biofouling resistance.43

Recently, Rajabi et al.3 have studied
the influence of the shape of ZnO nanostructures on reducing the membrane
fouling. Both ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods blended in the membrane
showed a reduction in membrane fouling, but the best biofouling reduction
was achieved by embedding the PES membrane with ZnO nanorods. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no systematic study has been reported
on in situ growth of ZnO nanorods on PES membranes and its consequences
on membrane properties, microstructure, and antibacterial properties.
The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of blending ZnO
nanoparticles in PES membranes, followed by in situ growth of ZnO
nanorods, and a study of their ability to reduce E.
coli bacterium attachment onto the membranes. The antibacterial activity of the
ZnO nanoparticle-blended PES membranes are compared to the activity
of the membranes with in situ-grown ZnO nanorods.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Membrane Characterization
The cross
section of all of the membranes (Figure 2) shows an asymmetric structure composed
of a thin skin top layer and a thick fingerlike bottom layer. The
pore structure of the membranes consists of a dense top layer of small-sized
pores that increase in size through the thickness of the membrane
forming microvoids and fingerlike structures. This phenomenon was observed
earlier upon the inclusion of silica nanoparticles by Huang et al.44

Figure 2 Scanning electron microscope images of PES–ZnO
membranes
cross section and the top surface at the insight.

Because of the hydrophilic in nature of ZnO nanoparticles,
they
tend to reside on the top surface of the PES membranes to escape with
water during the film formation stage, thus reducing the surface tension,
which can lead to the joining of pores in the membranes, forming larger
microvoids at the bottom. As the loading of zinc oxide nanoparticles
was increased from 2 to 6%, the viscosity of the polymer-doped solution
increased, making the water–solvent exchange slower and rendering
the pores to align vertically. The viscosity of the PES and ZnO–PES-doped
solutions showed Newtonian behavior, which was determined from the
slope of the shear stress–shear rate curves as shown in Figure S1. The linearly fitted data of these
curves are tabulated in Table S1.

Hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanorods has been reported extensively
in literature.45−47 Zinc nitrate is the Zn2+ source in our
case, and hexamine hydrolyses slowly in the solution to give OH–. The slow release of hydroxyl ions is required for
the controlled precipitation of ZnO to form oriented rods in the direction
of the (001) plane.46,48 1   2   3  During the first 4 h of growth, Zn2+ is
consumed in the formation of an intermediate state, which is
Zn(OH)+ or Zn(OH)2, depending on the pH of the
precursor solution. Through gradual hydrolysis of hexamine, the pH
of the solution is increased.49 The stability
of the intermediate state is reduced by the increase in the solution
pH, the reverse reaction is favored, leading to the dissolution of
the intermediate phase and precipitation to the more stable phase
ZnO(s).49 Zinc oxide dissolution
bulk solubility product constant (1.7 × 10–17 mol3 L–3) occurs over a wide range
of pH.50 It is well known that supersaturation
is necessary for crystal growth in the solution; thus, in our system,
the erosion of ZnO nanocrystallites should stop when the process achieves
equilibrium 4  During nanorod growth, the solution is supersaturated,
which suggests that erosion and growth proceed simultaneously when
the reaction achieves an equilibrium. As the erosion time increases,
the concentration of Zn(OH)n2–n(aq) increases and approaches critical
supersaturation. Peterson and Gregg51 and
Yamabi and Imai52 reported that Zn(OH)n2–n(aq) can form polyhydroxyl zinc complex, which is represented by 5  where n = 2 or 4, Zn2O(OH)2n−2 is the source
of the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of ZnO nanowires. As we
know, an alkaline solution is essential for the formation of ZnO nanostructures
because normally divalent metal ions do not hydrolyze in acidic environments.
The pH value of the growth solution is much lower than the isoelectric
point (IEP) of ZnO (∼7.4),53 implying
that ZnO crystals about 5–6 nm in size are positively charged
and have a higher solubility in water compared to that of bulk ZnO.54 HMTA and NH3·H2O
provide the NH3 (NH4+) and OH–, whereby the NH3 forms zinc amino complex [Zn(NH3)4]2+, thus leading to the consumption
of Zn2+ in the growth solution to eventually lead to the
growth of ZnO nanorods.48 The OH– ions obtained from the decomposition of methenamine lead to the
erosion of zinc ions from the crystallites. The polar (0001) plane
of the ZnO crystal seeds dissolve more quickly than the other six
symmetric nonpolar planes during the growth process, as the polar
face has a higher surface energy/atomic density (and is thus more
unstable) than that of the other faces.45 On the other hand, these dissolved Zn2+ from the nanocrystals
lead to local supersaturation, favoring the growth of nanorods. The
growth units of [Zn(OH)4]2– can thus be adsorbed on the circumference of
ZnO nuclei, whose surface energy (crystal) would decrease, thus resulting
in the generation of multiple active sites on the surface. The diameter
and the length of the formed rods depend on the availability of Zn2+ ions, the precursor pH, the temperature, and the growth
time.48,53 During this process of dissolution and growth,
the nanoparticles that blocked the pores of the membranes are dissolved,
as they are used as active site for the growth of the nanorods, leading
to a higher surface area of the membranes compared to that of the
membranes blended with ZnO nanoparticles only. The growth of zinc
oxide nanorods on the surface and through the thickness of the membrane
is governed by the amount of ZnO nanoparticles in the membranes, which
form the nuclei for the nanorod growth process. ZnO nanorods were
found to grow longer and thicker in the membranes fabricated with
increasing amounts of nanoparticles incorporated in the polymeric
matrix (Figure 3).
By increasing the ZnO content in the PES membrane to 6% and upon subsequent
growth of the nanorods, two growth mechanisms can be observed (Figure 3). The primary growth,
which gives thin ZnO nanorods and bigger particles forms due to the
Ostwald ripening, and also a secondary growth take place simultaneously.55 ZnO nanorods were found to grow unevenly on
the membrane surface as can also be observed from the SEM images shown
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 SEM images
of the PES membranes incorporated with ZnO nanoparticles
after ZnO nanorods growth. (A1) PES–ZnO-1 surface view and
(A2) cross section, (B1) PES–ZnO-2 surface view and (B2) cross
section, and (C1) PES–ZnO-3 surface view and (C2) cross section.

The attenuated total reflection
(ATR)–FTIR spectra of the
PES membranes and ZnO nanoparticles-modified PES membranes are shown
in Figure S2. All of the spectra show characteristic
PES patterns with no noticeable additional peaks observed upon the
addition of ZnO nanoparticles. The PES structure corresponding peaks
appear at 1582 cm–1 for (C=C) aromatic benzene
rings. The peak at 1490 cm–1 corresponds to the
C–C band of the aromatic ring. Sulfone group (S=O) appears
at 1246 cm–1 and the aromatic ether (C–O–C)
C–O band stretch appears at 1108 cm–1. Thus,
it can be reasonably concluded that the inclusion of ZnO nanoparticles
does not affect the molecular integrity of the PES membranes.

The XRD spectra (Figure 4) of the composite membranes confirm the inclusion of ZnO
nanoparticles and the growth of nanorods, as ZnO peaks were found
to be more pronounced in the samples with increasing content of the
nanoparticles. The main diffraction due to ZnO crystals occurs at
31.85, 34.53, 36.35, 56.68, and 62.88°. A comparison of the relative
intensities of planes (100), (002), and (101) showed that the relative
intensities of the peaks (002) and (101) increased with increase in
ZnO content. This indicates a nonpreferential growth of ZnO nanorods
in the membranes.

Figure 4 XRD patterns of (A) PES–ZnO nanoparticles and (B)
PES–ZnO
nanorods membranes.

The growth orientation
and the surface coverage of the ZnO nanorods
play a significant role in the surface wetting characteristics, as
has been shown by Myint et al.56 It is
expected that optimization of the growth time of the nanorods will
affect the density and the orientation of the rods; therefore, the
surface properties can be controlled. The membrane surface hydrophilicity
was evaluated by measuring the water contact angle in Figure 5. The contact angle of pure
PES membrane was 70.65 ± 1.55°, which is considered as moderately
hydrophilic, whereas the contact angle of the composite membrane decreased
with increasing content of ZnO nanoparticles, which indicates an increase
in the surface hydrophilicity. The effect of ZnO nanoparticles inclusion
in PES was reported by other researchers, who used ZnO nanoparticles
in the range of 0.5–2% and reported enhanced water flux through
the membranes.3,26,33,35,43 After the
growth of ZnO nanorods, the hydrophilicity of the PES–ZnO membranes
was found to increase slightly compared to that of pristine PES. It
is well known that the hydrophilicity of ZnO nanorod-coated surfaces
is dependent on the nanorod size and growth orientations.57

Figure 5 Water contact angle of the PES and PES–ZnO membranes
measured
at 25 °C.

Another surface property
that affects the membrane performance
is surface charge, which is a measure of the zeta potential and the
IEP of the membranes. The titration curves in Figure S3 show the zeta potential of the PES and ZnO-NPs-modified
PES membranes from pH ∼ 7 to pH 3, and the IEPs are summarized
in Table 1. The IEP
of pure PES is at pH 3.48, which was less acidic for the membranes
blended with ZnO nanoparticles ranging from pH 3.85 to 4.14 and pH
3.84 to 4.02 on the membrane fabricated after growing the nanorods.

2.2 Water Flux and Bovine Serum
Albumin (BSA)
Removal
The pure water flux through the PES membrane and
the ZnO-modified PES membranes measured at 10 bar pressure and monitored
over 90 min is shown in Figure 6. The water flux for the pristine PES membranes was found
to be 59.4 L m–2 h–1. Inspite
of increased hydrophilicity of the membranes with the inclusion of
ZnO nanoparticles, there was a decline in the water flux as ZnO content
increased in the composite membranes. The lowest flux was observed
to be 8.85 L m–2 h–1 for the membrane
blended with 6% ZnO nanoparticles. This decline in the flux occurred
due to the pore blockage upon blending the membranes with ZnO nanoparticles.
However, upon growing ZnO nanorods on the membranes, the water permeation
was found to be higher than the permeation through the membranes blended
with ZnO nanoparticles alone. The higher surface area of the nanorods
and native hydrophilicity of ZnO played a role in enhancing the water
permeation through the membranes. The highest water flux of 125.6
L m–2 h–1 was achieved by blending
the PES membranes with 4% ZnO nanoparticles and then growing ZnO nanorods.

Figure 6 Pure water
flux of the membranes measured at 10 bar.

The membranes blended with ZnO nanoparticles and further
modified
by growing the nanorods were found to have a high BSA rejection and
high water flux recovery after the BSA separation (Figure 7), compared to those of pristine
PES and the PES membranes blended with ZnO nanoparticles. The BSA
(96.53%) was removed using both the PES membrane blended with 4 and
6% ZnO and further modified by growing ZnO nanorods. However, the
flux recovery was higher for the former membrane.

water flux recovery after BSA filtration
measure at 10 bar for the PES and ZnO-modified membranes.

2.3 Antibacterial Activity
In the presence
of the PES membranes modified with zinc oxide nanoparticles growth
and in situ growth of nanorods under visible light irradiation, the
number of colony-forming units (CFUs) of E. coli was significantly lower compared to that observed on the unmodified
PES membrane (Figure 8) (ANOVA: p < 0.0001). On the other hand, the
number of CFUs remained relatively unchanged for all of the samples
kept under dark conditions. In case of both nanoparticles and nanorods,
the antibacterial activity was found to increase with an increase
in the zinc oxide content in the membranes (Figure 8). The highest reduction in the number of
E. coli CFUs were observed in the membranes with 6% nanoparticles
inclusion which were successively modified with ZnO nanorods. From our experimental
results, the PES membrane embedded with nanorods has a significantly
higher antibacterial activity (ANOVA, HSD, p <
0.05) compared to that of membranes fabricated solely with embedded
nanoparticles. The absorbance measurements also support the observations
made from the bacterial counting experiments.

Figure 8 Effect of ZnO NPs (A)
and ZnO NRs (B) in light (1060 W m–2) or dark conditions
on CFUs (viable cells) for E.
coli presented as mean ± SD of three replicates.

The CFU counting experiments are
based on the growth of bacteria
on agar.58 To confirm these measurements
of the experiment, the number of viable bacteria was estimated by
an epifloroscence microscopy through the staining of live and dead
bacterial cells with SYBR green and propidium iodide dyes.59 The percentage of viable cells was found to
be significantly reduced (ANOVA: p < 0.0001) in
the presence of PES membranes with variable concentrations of embedded
ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods compared to that of unmodified PES
membrane in the presence of light (Figure 9). The number of viable bacterial cells remained
relatively similar for all of the samples under dark conditions. The
highest bacterial inactivation was achieved using the PES membranes
embedded with 6% ZnO nanorods (Figure 11). An overall reduction in the number of
cells was also observed after the photocatalytic treatment with PES
membranes embedded with zinc oxide nanoparticles and nanorods.

NPs (A) and ZnO NRs (B) in light (1060 W m–2) or
dark conditions (no irradiation) on viability of E.
coli bacterium after 5 h of photocatalysis. Data
are presented as the mean ± SD of three replicates. Viable cell
percentage (number of viable cells over total number of cells in %)
is determined by live/dead staining. Subset in the figure shows representative
stained micrograph for each sample.

Upon the excitation of zinc oxide with light above the band
gap
and in the presence of O2 and water, highly reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are produced, which leads to the formation of O2–, OH•, and other oxygenated
radical species.60 In photon-activated
catalysis, the photocatalytic activity depends on the ability of the
catalyst to create electron–hole pairs, which generate free
radicals (hydroxyl radicals: •OH) that are capable
of undergoing secondary reactions that can lead to microbial mortality
as explained recently by Sathe et al.61 The photogenerated electrons at the conduction band reduce the adsorbed
oxygen (O2) or organics producing a super oxide anion (O2–), which can react with the hydrogen ion
(H+) to produce HO2*, subsequently forming water
molecules. The photogenerated hole at the
valence band can react with the adsorbed species according to following
possible processes. For example, a hole can directly react with an
organic molecule and oxidize it as follows62 6  It can also oxidize hydroxyl radical ion to
hydroxyl radical 7  Also, it can oxidize water
to give hydrogen
ion and hydroxyl radical 8  

2.4 Bacterial
Regrowth
Similar to the
antibacterial studies discussed in the last section, we observed that
under light irradiation (in the presence of PES membranes modified
with both ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods), there was a significant
reduction in bacterial abundance (expressed as culture absorbance)
compared to the control (ANOVA: p < 0.0001, Figures 10 and 11). Maximum reduction
in absorbance was observed for the PES membrane modified with 6% ZnO
nanoparticles and nanorods (Figures 10 and 11). Overall, a higher reduction in
absorbance was observed with the PES membrane embedded with ZnO nanorods
compared to that of the PES membranes embedded with nanoparticles.
There was no effect of nanorods and nanoparticles under dark conditions.
No bacterial regrowth was found in the presence of PES membranes modified
with both ZnO nanoparticles and nanorods at all concentrations under
light irradiation after 24 and 48 h incubation. These results suggest
that most of the bacteria treated with the membranes were killed and
the observed antibacterial activity is permanent.

Figure 10 Effect of ZnO NPs (A)
in dark (0 W m–2) and (B)
in light (1060 W m–2) on regrowth of E. coli bacterium before photocatalysis, after photocatalysis,
and after 24 h and after 48 h incubation.

Figure 11 Effect of ZnO NRs (A) in light (0 W m–2) and
(B) in dark (1060 W m–2) on regrowth of E. coli bacterium before photocatalysis, after photocatalysis,
and after 24 h and after 48 h incubation.

In the control samples kept in dark (no light exposure during
the
experiment), bacterial growth was observed with increased absorbance
over 24 and 48 h. Thus, the antibacterial activity of the PES membranes
modified with both ZnO NP and ZnO NR only occurs upon irradiation
with light, leading to the photocatalytic inhibition of the bacterial
growth.63

2.5 Mechanism
of Action
Former studies
have demonstrated that ZnO nanoparticles possess strong antimicrobial
activities against common pathogens such as S. aureus, S. epidermis, and E. coli.36,64 Zinc oxide nanorods
were also shown to possess broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against
Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative
(E. coli, P. aeruginosa) bacteria and marine microalga Dunaliella salina in the presence of light.63,65 Our recent report showed
the antifouling activity of zinc oxide nanorods supported on glass
substrates.61 The proposed antibacterial
properties of zinc oxide nanostructures include two possible mechanisms
of action: (1) the production of ROS, mostly hydroxyl radicals and
singlet oxygen, and (2) the toxicity of Zn2+ ions released
from the nanocomposite substrate.66,67 Our current
and previous investigations61,68 clearly demonstrated
that the antifouling activity of ZnO nanorods is mainly due to the
production of ROS. The produced ROS causes oxidation of the membrane
lipids, resulting in membrane damage, leading to cell lysis.69 Our experiments showed better performance of
zinc oxide nanorods over zinc oxide nanoparticles embedded within
the PES matrix. This is probably due to the higher surface area of
zinc oxide nanorods over nanoparticles. According to several reports,
the generation of ROS, which are responsible for the antimicrobial
activity, usually depends on the available surface area of ZnO nanostructures.
A higher surface area accounts for a higher ROS production.29,64

3 Conclusions
The PES membranes blended
with ZnO nanoparticles were fabricated
by the phase inversion method and then used for the in situ growth
of ZnO nanorods hydrothermally to improve the antibacterial activity
of the membranes. The membranes have a asymmetric pore structure consisting
of a top dense pore layer with fingerlike micropores. Surface properties
of the membranes were altered by controlling ZnO content and growth
conditions. The growth orientation was dependent on the amount and
disparity of ZnO nanoparticles. The contact angle of the ZnO-blended
membranes was reduced compared to that of the pristine PES membrane,
indicating a higher hydrophilicity. Increasing the loading of ZnO
nanoparticles up to 6% leads to nanoparticles aggregation and pore
blockage, which reduces the water permeation by 15% compared to that
of the pristine PES membrane. By in situ growth of ZnO nanorods, the
surface area of the membranes was increased and the water flux was
improved. The BSA removal was improved by growing the nanorods, and
the flux was recovered up to 89.8% using the PES membrane blended
with 4% ZnO and further modified by growing ZnO nanorods. Under the
condition of light irradiation, E. coli growth was inhibited in the presence of the PES membranes modified
by the incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles and the growth of ZnO nanorods.
The inhibition was enhanced by increasing ZnO content due to the enhancement
in the formation of the ROS, which attack the bacteria. No bacterial
regrowth was observed after 48 h of incubation, indicating that the
ROS kill most of the bacteria in the presence ZnO nanoparticles and
nanorods. The highest bacterial growth reduction was 90%, which was
achieved in the presence of the PES membrane incorporated with 6%
ZnO nanoparticles and further modified by the growth of ZnO nanorods.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
PES granules (Mw 58 000 g/mol)
were purchased from Goodfellow
Cambridge Limited (England). 1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) (Fluka analytical,
Germany) was used as the solvent to dissolve PES. Zinc oxide nanoparticles
(10–30 nm) were supplied by U.S. Research Nanomaterials, Inc.

Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (M.W. 297.49 g/mol, 99.05%) (Sigma-Aldrich)
and hexamethylenetetramine (M.W 140.19 g/mol, 99.0%) (Merck) were
used to prepare the precursor solutions for the growth of ZnO nanorods.

Epoxy (No. 20-8130-128) and Epoxy Hardener (No. 20-8132-032) (Buehler)
were used for SEM sample preparation. Acetone and deionized water
were used for cleaning purposes.

4.2 Fabrication
of PES–ZnO NPs Membranes
Zinc oxide-blended PES membrane
was fabricated by phase inversion
and polymerization in deionized water.2,70−72 First, zinc oxide nanoparticles (10–30 nm) were dispersed
in NMP by probe sonication for 30 min followed by magnetic stirring
for 24 h. PES was added slowly and the mixture stirred for over 24
h to form a homogenous admixture. The quantities of the reagents used
in these experiments and the viscosity of the nanoparticles containing
the polymer solution are shown in Table 2. The viscosity was determined using a plate-to-plate
method (Bohin
Genmini Rotonetic drive 2 Rheometer, U.K.). The shear rates were measured
with 2 mL samples at 25 °C from 0.1 to 100 s–1 in 5 min.

The
membranes were cast on a (20 × 20 cm2) flat
glass plate, and the casting thickness was adjusted by sticking tapes
at the edges of the plate.26,71 A line of the solution
was poured at one edge of the plate and then drawn with a steel tool
to make a film of about 240 μm thickness. The membrane was then
placed in a water bath at room temperature overnight and then washed
repeatedly with deionized water followed by first drying in air for
2 days and then in a vacuum oven at 20 °C for 12 h.

4.3 Zinc Oxide Nanorods Hydrothermal Growth
The growth
solution was prepared by mixing equimolar (20 mM) concentration
of zinc nitrate with hexamethylenetetramine solution.49 The membranes were then immersed in the growth solution
for 5 h and kept in an oven preheated to 90 °C. After 5 h, the
membranes were removed from the growth solution, washed several times
with deionized water, and dried at room temperature overnight followed
by additional drying in a vacuum oven at room temperature at (25 °C)
for 15 h.

4.4 Membrane Characterization
The images
of membrane surface and the cross-sectional morphology were captured
using JSM-7600F Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, from
JEOL (Japan). The microscope was evacuated to 4 × 10–4 Pa and operated at 15 kV and 8 mA. The membrane surface was analyzed
by mounting a piece of the membrane on an adhesive carbon film stuck
to an aluminum sample holder to avoid charging. To obtain clear SEM
micrographs, the membrane samples on the aluminum stub were further
coated with a thin film of platinum using JFC-1600 Auto Fine Coater,
from JEOL.

To scan the cross section of the membrane, a small
piece of the sample was cut and fractured with liquid nitrogen or
sliced using microtome equipped with a glass knife to cut thin sections
of 500 nm thickness. Prior to slicing, the membrane was embedded in
the epoxy to make a hard block.

The functional groups in the
membrane’s chemical structure
were analyzed by ATR infrared spectroscopy from PerkinElmer (SpectraOne)
in the 4000–400 cm–1 range.

The membrane’s
hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity was determined
by measuring the static contact angle of the water drop on the membrane
with Theta Lite attention tensiometer (Biolin Scientific, Sweden)
using the sessile drop technique. A membrane film sample of 2 cm ×
4 cm size was mounted on a glass slide supported with a double layer
tape, and 5 μL of deionized water was placed on the surface
of the membrane using a Hamilton syringe. Three measurements were
made on each sample for left and right contact angles and then the
average values were recorded.

The zeta potential of the membranes
was measured using SurPASS
Electrokinetic Analyzer from Anton Paar. A 0.001 M KCl(aq) solution
was used as the electrolyte, and the pH was set at 6.64. The electrolytic
solution was pumped through
the cell, consisting of two membranes (2 cm × 1 cm) placed 100
μm apart. The streaming current method was chosen, and the zeta
potential of the membranes at pH 6–7 was measured three times
and then averaged. To obtain the IEP, a titration step was used for
the pH range (7–3).

4.5 Pure Water Flux and BSA
Rejection
The pure water flux and the BSA flux were measured
using an ISCO
Syringe pump (model 500D) coupled with an accumulator and a membrane
support. First, the membrane was compacted at 10 bar for 90 min and
then the water flux was measured at 10 bar. The flux was determined
following eq 9 9  where J is the
flux (L m–2 h–1), V is the
volume of the collected permeate (L) at the period of time Δt (h), and A is the effective area of the
membrane (m2).

After pure water flux measurements,
the BSA was filtered through the membrane, which was then rinsed with
deionized water, followed by pure water flux analysis to measure the
flux recovery after the BSA filtration. The BSA rejection
(eq 2) and the pure water
flux recovery (eq 3)
were calculated using the following equations 10   11  Cp and Cf are the BSA concentrations in the permeate
and the feed, respectively, JR is the
recovered water flux after the BSA filtration, and J0 is the initial water flux. The BSA concentration was
obtained from the absorbance measurements using SHIMADZU UV–visible
spectrophotometer (model UV-1650PC).

4.6 Antibacterial
Activity of PES Membranes
4.6.1 Bacterial Culture and
Photocatalysis
The effect of ZnO nanoparticle concentration
on the Gram-negative
bacterium Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)
was studied under visible light irradiation. The bacteria were cultured
in Luria Bertani broth (Difco, Bergen County, NJ) (media pH 7.5) at
37 °C for 12 h. The bacterial cells were centrifuged at 5000
g at 25 °C for 10 min and resuspended in sterile deionized water.
The 24-well plates (Costar, Tewksbury, MA) were used to carry out
the photocatalysis experiments. Membrane samples of dimensions (0.5
cm × 0.5 cm) were cut and placed at the bottom of the 24-well
plates. Each of the 24-well plates containing membranes (with ZnO
nanoparticles or nanorods) or control samples (pure PES) was filled
with 1.5 mL of the bacterial culture. Two similar sets of plates were
prepared, one of which was exposed to visible light (∼AM 1.5G
irradiation, ∼1060 and 530 W m–2), whereas
the second set was covered with an aluminum foil and used as a dark
control (0 W m–2). Each experiment was conducted
for 5 h at 35 °C. All of the experiments were carried out three
times. After 5 h, the bacterial density and conditions were determined
to study the growth and viability.

4.6.2 Absorbance
Measurement
At the end
of the antibacterial experiments, 100 μL of the broth culture
from each well (both under light and dark conditions) were collected
and the absorbance was measured at 620 nm using a plate reader (Thermo
Scientific). Three readings were taken, and the mean value was reported.

4.6.3 CFU Estimation
The CFU counting
experiments were based on the growth of bacteria on agar.58 To confirm these measurements of the experiment,
the number of viable bacteria was estimated by an epifloroscence microscope
through the staining of live and dead bacterial cells with SYBR green
and propidium iodide dyes.59 At the end
of the antibacterial experiments, 1 mL of the broth culture from each
well (both under light and dark conditions) was collected and diluted
50 times with sterile deionized water to determine the number of CFUs.
A 0.1 mL from each diluted sample was plated on a petridish containing
sterile nutrient agar (Difco). The plates were incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h to allow microbial growth. Colonies were counted manually
after 24 h. The CFU/mL was calculated using the following formula: 12  

4.6.4 Variability Staining
At the end
of the antibacterial experiments, 100 μL of the broth culture
from each well (either after exposure to visible light or kept in
dark conditions) was collected and utilized immediately for live and
dead cell staining to estimate the number of dead cells. The live
and dead cell staining of the samples was performed as per manufacturer’s
instructions using live/dead Baclight bacterial viability kit (Life
Technologies, Thermo Fisher). Ten microliters of the stained cell
suspension was placed on a microscope slide. The number of live and
dead bacteria in 20 randomly selected fields of view (area = 0.001
mm2) was counted using an epifloroscence microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Germany; magnification 1000×). This method uses a mixture
of SYTO 9 and propidium iodide dyes in dimethyl sulfoxide. SYTO 9
specifically stains cells with undamaged membranes, whereas the PI
stains the cells with damaged membranes, enabling the quantification
of live and dead cells in the samples.

4.6.5 Bacterial
Regrowth Study after Photocatalytic
Treatment
The bacterial cell suspensions treated with each
type of membrane from 24-well plates were collected before and after
5 h of visible light irradiation using AM 1.5G irradiation with the
incident power of 1 kW m–2 from a solar simulator
(SS1.6 kW from Sciencetech, Canada) fitted with an IR filter. Bacterial
regrowth was then monitored in the treated water sample for up to
48 h. The collected bacterial suspensions were then transferred to
a 96-well plate (Costar, Tewksbury, MA) and maintained at 37 °C
as described in Section 4.6.1. The bacterial
regrowth was tested by accessing the increase in the bacterial biomass
after 5, 24, and 48 h of light irradiation by absorbance spectroscopy
following the 620 nm peak using a plate reader (Thermo Scientific).
Three readings were taken, and the mean value was calculated.

4.6.6 Staining Analysis
Using Statistica
11 (Statsoft), the assumption of normality of the data was verified
using the Shapiro–Wilk’s W-test. Factorial ANOVA was
used to test the effect of photocatalytic treatment with nanocomposite
membranes on the total bacterial density and the densities of live
and dead bacteria. Tukey HSD post hoc test was used to test the significance
of differences between densities of total live and dead bacteria.
In all of the cases, the probability of error was 5% and the p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
