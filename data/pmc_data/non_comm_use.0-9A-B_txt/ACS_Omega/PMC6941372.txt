Herein, we report the transformation of readily accessed
acyl hydrazides
into protected 2-aminobenzophenones via a two-step process involving
an aryne-based molecular rearrangement followed by a one-pot addition–elimination
procedure. The assembly of the scaffold is tolerant of a wide variety
of functional groups, and the carbamate group on the product can be
facilely removed to afford highly valuable 2-aminobenzophenones. Application
of the protocol was demonstrated in the synthesis of neurological

Introduction
2-Aminobenzophenones are a very important
class of compounds in
medicinal and organic chemistry. Compounds bearing this structure
have displayed desirable pharmacological use as antimitotic,1 antitumor,2 and antiproliferative3 agents, as well as skeletal muscle relaxants.4 2-Aminobenzophenones are also useful starting
materials for the synthesis of a wide variety of fine chemicals such
as acridones,5 quinolines,6−8 quinazolines,9−11 quinolinones,12 quinoxalinones,13 fluorenones,14 benzisoxazoles,15 indazoles,16 indoles,17 2-quinazolinones,18 benzothiophenes,19 diaryldibenzodiazocines,20 and (perhaps most noteworthy) benzodiazepines.21−24 As such, various methodologies for the synthesis of 2-aminobenzophenones
and their derivatives have been developed, including (i) Friedel–Crafts
acylation of para-substituted anilines;25,26 (ii) reaction
of 2-aminobenzaldehydes with aryl Grignard reagents followed by oxidation
with CuCl2;27 (iii) Pd-catalyzed
addition of arylboronic acids28 or sodium
arylsulfinates29 to 2-aminobenzonitriles;
(iv) Pd-catalyzed C–H bond coupling of ortho-directed anilines;30 and (v) aryl insertion into the C–N of
amides31 or imides.32 Unfortunately, however, many of these processes suffer
from either poor substrate scope (e.g., Friedel–Crafts processes
falter when utilizing electron-poor arenes), require multiple reaction
steps (e.g., the Grignard-based route obviates the presence of acidic
protons and requires product oxidation to obtain the ketone), or require
the use of expensive metal catalysts (e.g., Pd(OAc)2, Pd(TFA)2). Application of aryne insertion chemistry appears to be
the most promising of these conditions; however, work here has been
primarily focused on the formation of N-aryl 2-aminobenzophenones.31

There has been a substantial number of
recent reports for the synthesis
of acyl hydrazides and their conversion into a variety of useful chemical
functionalities.33 More specifically, facilely
accessed acyl hydrazides have been reported as shelf-stable intermediates
for the creation of esters, thioesters, amides,34 ketones,35N-acyl carbamates,36 1H- and 2H-indazoles,37 and 1,3,4-oxadiazoles,38 as well as being
employed as precursors for the formation of bioactive molecules such
as hydroxamic acids39 and macrocyclic enamides.40 Recently, we developed conditions for the reaction
of arynes with acyl hydrazides in which a novel molecular rearrangement
reaction pathway facilitates the formation of 2-hydrazobenzophenones.37 We envisioned that the transformation of this
entity into useful 2-aminobenzophenones would be possible via rupture
of the N–N bond in a one-pot alkylation–E1cB elimination
procedure (Scheme 1). The cleavage of the N–N bond without the use of hydrogenation
procedures involving expensive/undesirable metals was seen as a key
aspect in itself; this is particularly well described in related work
by Magnus et al.41 Finally, we postulated
that our methodology could be applied for the synthesis of medicinally
relevant benzodiazepines.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes To Access 2-Aminobenzophenones
Results and Discussion
Our study began with the reaction
of 2-hydrazobenzophenone 1a with tert-butyl bromoacetate 2a in the presence of a base with
the aim of forming protected 2-aminobenzophenone 3a in
a two-step one-pot procedure. Initially, the reaction
was carried out using an excess of NaH at 20 °C (Table 1, entry 1).36 While these conditions did provide access to desired product 3a, it was only in a modest yield of 45%. Increasing the temperature
to 50 °C had a positive effect on yield with 67% of 3a being isolated (Table 1, entry 2).

Unfortunately, the efficiency of the reaction was
not improved
by lowering the number of equivalents of base to 3, where a 60% yield
of the desired product and a 12% yield of alkylated-hydrazide intermediate 4a were recovered (Table 1, entry 3). We next decided to try a two-step process,
i.e., the use of 1 equiv of NaH and 1.1 equiv of tert-butyl bromoacetate 2a at room temperature to isolate
the resulting alkylated acyl hydrazide intermediate 4a and then subjecting this intermediate to an additional equivalent
of NaH relative to intermediate isolated. This resulted in an improved
overall isolated yield, 77%, of desired product 3a over
the two steps (Table 1, entry 4). In an effort to further improve the efficiency of the
process, we utilized an alkylating agent with two electron-withdrawing
groups in an attempt to promote elimination. We first utilized 1.1
equiv of diethyl bromomalonate 2b as the alkylating agent
with 1 equiv of NaH in an attempt to isolate alkylated intermediate 4b (Table 1, entry 5). Interestingly, no intermediate was isolated under these
conditions with a 35% yield of the protected 2-aminobenzophenone product 3a and 45% recovery of starting material 1a observed.
We suspected that the increased acidity of the α proton in alkylated-hydrazide
intermediate 4b resulted in rapid elimination to product 3a. In an attempt to exploit this, a one-pot procedure using
2 equiv of base and alkylating agent was trialed; however, this resulted
in only a 57% yield of 3a due to the formation of a significant
amount of a malonate salt (Table 1, entry 6). Increasing the equivalents of NaH and malonate 2b to 2.5 resulted in a slight decrease in yield (53%) with
even more malonate salt observed (Table 1, entry 7). We therefore added malonate 2b dropwise to minimize the consumption of NaH prior to intermediate 4b formation. Gratifyingly, this resulted in a high yield
of the desired product, 82% (Table 1, entry 8), with no intermediate or malonate salt observed.
Having established a procedure that led to the formation of 3a in excellent yield, the suitability of other bases was
appraised (Table 1,
entries 9–12). Unfortunately, the substitution of NaH for weaker
bases (i.e., Cs2CO3, NEt3, NaOtBu, NaOEt) proved detrimental to yield with
triethylamine not even facilitating the initial alkylation step. The
other bases were able to carry out the alkylation and E1cB elimination
steps, but gave low yields of the desired product. In the case of
using Cs2CO3, we highlight that although compounds 3a and 4b were isolated, the crude reaction mixture
appeared to be a complex mixture of many products.

With the
optimized conditions for the transformation of 2-hydrazobenzophenones
into protected 2-aminobenzophenones in hand, we took the opportunity
to investigate the applicability of our protocol for the formation
of various protected 2-aminobenzophenones (Scheme 2). A range of 2-hydrazobenzophenones were
examined (1a–1j) under the developed
reaction conditions. All of the starting 2-hydrazobenzophenones were
prepared in good yields using our previously reported procedure for
the reaction of acyl hydrazides with benzynes (see the Supporting Information for details).

Scheme 2 Reaction
Scope for the Formation of Protected 2-Aminobenzophenones 3
Gram scale.

Reaction conditions: 2-aminobenzophenone 1 (0.50 mmol, 1 equiv) with NaH (1.25 mmol, 2.5 equiv) in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) (3 mL) followed by the dropwise addition of
diethyl bromomalonate 2b (1.25 mmol, 2.50 equiv) at 20
°C for 4 h.

To our delight, the reaction
was tolerant of various functional
groups on the aromatic motif (e.g., halo, methyl, methoxy, and trifluoromethyl
functionalities) with good to excellent yields (64–82%) observed.
The reaction protocol proved to be tolerant of electron-poor, electron-neutral,
and electron-rich aromatic rings, with ortho-, meta-, and para-substitutions
having no significant effect on yield. The optimized protocol was
also shown to be applicable to a gram-scale synthesis, with compound 3a being prepared in a 72% yield.

Having established
an efficient protocol for the formation of protected
2-aminobenzophenones, we next investigated conditions for deprotection.
Initially, we trialed previously reported Brønsted-acid-based
conditions42 and observed that refluxing 3b in HCl (12 M) resulted in the full conversion of starting
material with an excellent yield of 2-aminobenzophenone 5b obtained (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). Other previously reported conditions, the use
of aqueous KOH in dimethylacetamide,43 did
not result in the full conversion of starting material; even increasing
the reaction temperature and concentration of KOH did not improve
the yield and conversion significantly (Table 2, entries 3–7). Most pleasingly, however,
the use of Lewis acid AlCl3 in dichloromethane resulted
in the rapid deprotection (45 min) of the isopropyl carbamate with
an exceptional isolated yield of product 5b observed,
92% (Table 2, entry
8; a 60% overall yield of 5b from its corresponding acyl
hydrazide).44 The assertion of Lewis acidity
having a role in the reaction is based on the fact that the use of
HCl (12 M) alone (in either 1,4-dioxane or EtOAc) only resulted in
complete conversion after 16 h at 110 °C, i.e., rather than being
complete in 45 min at 0 °C when using AlCl3. In fact,
the reaction when using HCl (12 M) after 16 h at room temperature
only resulted in an 11% yield of 5b (17% conversion of 3b). The optimized deprotection conditions were then trialed
on electron-poor and electron-rich protected 2-aminobenzophenones 3d and 3h (respectively). To our delight, this
afforded the corresponding 2-aminobenzophenones 5d and 5h in excellent yields (>85%, Table 2, inset).

Recognizing the potential of the protocol for the
synthesis of
functional 2-aminobenzophenones, we turned our attention to providing
a tangible application of the protocol for the synthesis of a pharmaceutically
relevant benzodiazepine (Scheme 3), as a representative example, especially as aryne
chemistry is being increasingly employed to synthesize such systems.45 Phenazepam is a member of a class of molecules
that have found use in the treatment of various psychiatric and neurological
disorders.46 Furthermore, phenazepam can
be employed as a precursor for the formation of more complex benzodiazepines
such as cinazepam and 3-hydroxyphenazepam.47 We envisioned that phenazepam could be readily accessed via our
optimized methodology. More specifically, the chloro entity could
be incorporated through the use of starting aldehyde 6 and the bromo substituent could be installed through para-directed
bromination of 2-aminobenzophenone 8. Initially, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde 6 was transformed into the corresponding acyl hydrazide 7 via hydroacylation of diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD).
Aryl insertion into the C(O)–N bond utilizing aryne-based molecular
transformation resulted in 2-hydrazobenzophenone 1g in
a 67% yield. This species was submitted to our addition–elimination
protocol to afford protected 2-aminobenzophenone 3g in
a 71% yield. Lewis acidic deprotection of the carbamate group afforded
2-aminobenzophenone 5g in a 91% yield. para-Directed
electrophilic bromination using NBS introduced bromine at the 7-position
to form 8 in a 90% yield. Finally, a one-pot alkylation–cyclization
procedure led to an excellent yield of phenazepam (85%). As such,
through the application of our novel methodology, we were able to
obtain the desired benzodiazepine in good yield (and even without
any of the reaction steps being optimized).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown 2-hydrazobenzophenones
to be excellent
candidates for the synthesis of functional 2-aminobenzophenones, which
have many applications in terms of their pharmacological and synthetic
uses (as exemplified by the extensive catalogue of bioactive molecules
they can be transformed into).5−24 A one-pot, alkylation–E1cB elimination procedure to produce
isopropyl carbamate protected 2-aminobenzophenones from 2-hydrazobenzophenones
has been developed. Moreover, the protocol is tolerant of many functional
groups, and the deprotection of the isopropyl carbamate has been optimized
to produce 2-aminobenzophenones in high yield. Finally, the application
of both of these methods was demonstrated in the synthesis of phenazepam.

General Experimental Methods
All reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich or AlfaAesar and were used as received without
further purification unless otherwise stated. Where described below,
petrol refers to petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60 °C). All
reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on precoated
silica gel plates. Silica get plates were initially examined under
short-wave UV light and then developed with the use of an aqueous
potassium permanganate stain. Flash column chromatography was carried
out with preloaded GraceResolv flash cartridges on a Biotage Isolera
Spektra One flash chromatography system. Quoted yields refer to chromatographically
and spectroscopically pure compounds unless otherwise stated. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 300, 600, or 700 MHz and 13C NMR at 150 or 175 MHz on a Bruker Avance 300, Bruker Avance
III 600, or Bruker Avance Neo 700 spectrometer. All spectra were recorded
at room temperature unless stated otherwise. The chemical shifts (δ)
for 1H and 13C are quoted relative to residual
signals of the solvent on the parts per million (ppm) scale. Coupling
constants (J values) are reported in hertz (Hz) and
are reported as JH–H unless otherwise
stated. Signal multiplicities in 13C NMR were determined
using the distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)
spectral editing technique. Melting points were measured with a Gallenkamp
apparatus and are uncorrected.

to room temperature and stirred for a further 30 min. The solution
was quenched with NaHCO3 and extracted with EtOAc. The
combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4) and filtered,
and the solvent removed in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography
(10–80% EtOAc/petrol) afforded 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate

General Experimental for the Formation of 2-Hydrazobenzophenones 1a–j: Method B
To a solution
of acyl hydrazide (500 μmol, 1.0 equiv) and TBAT (1.00 mmol,
540 mg, 2.0 equiv) in toluene (6 mL) was added 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
trifluoromethanesulfonate (750 μmol, 182 μL, 1.5 equiv).
The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 16 h. The resulting
solution was then allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the
solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The resultant crude residue was purified
as described below. These 2-hydrazobenzophenone compounds exist as
rotamers, and this leads to broadness in peaks + additional peaks
(the stereodynamics of the N–N bond about hydrazide-type molecules
is well known in the literature; see for example: ref (40)). As such, we conducted
VT NMR experiments on a model compound (i.e., compound 1a) to prove that the additional peaks for the 2-hydrazobenzophenones
at room temperature were indeed very likely to be due to the rotameric
nature of these molecules.

General Experimental for the Formation of Isopropyl Carbamate
Protected 2-Aminobenzophenones 3a–j: Method C
To a stirring solution of sodium hydride (60%
mineral oil dispersion, 50 mg, 1.25 mmol, 2.5 equiv) in anhydrous
THF (0.5 mL) under an atmosphere of argon was added dropwise a solution
of 2-hydrazobenzophenone (0.5 mmol, 1 equiv) predissolved in anhydrous
THF (1 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred for 5 min. After
this time, to the reaction mixture was added diethyl bromomalonate
(205 μL, 1.25 mmol, 2.5 equiv) predissolved in 1.5 mL anhydrous
THF via a syringe pump (over 30 min, 5.7 μL min–1). The reaction mixture was then stirred at 20 °C for 4 h and
monitored via TLC till completion and poured over sat. aq. NH4Cl (10 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with EtOAc
(3 × 15 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4) and filtered, and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The
resultant residue was purified as described below.

General Experimental for the Deprotection of Isopropyl Carbamate
Protected 2-Aminobenzophenones 5: Method D
To
a stirring solution of aluminum chloride (4 mmol, 4 equiv) in dichloromethane
(2 mL) was added dropwise isopropyl carbamate protected 2-aminobenzophenone
(1 mmol, 1 equiv) predissolved in dichloromethane (0.5 mL). The mixture
was then stirred for 1 h and monitored via TLC till completion. The
reaction mixture was then poured into ice water (10 mL). If a solid
precipitate was formed, the mixture was filtered and the solid was
washed with water (3 × 3 mL) and dried in vacuo. If no solid
was formed, the mixture was then extracted with EtOAc (3 × 4
mL). The combined organic extracts were then washed with water (3
× 4 mL), dried (MgSO4), and concentrated in vacuo.
The resultant residue was purified as described below.
