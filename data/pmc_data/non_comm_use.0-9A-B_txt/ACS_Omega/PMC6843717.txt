The Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are
potential targets against metastatic
diseases. We characterized the small molecule MBQ-167 as an effective
dual Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor that reduces HER2-type tumor growth and metastasis
in mice by ∼90%. This study reports the pharmacokinetics and
tissue distribution of MBQ-167 following intraperitoneal and oral
single-dose administrations. We first developed and validated a bioanalytical
method for the quantitation of MBQ-167 in mouse plasma and tissues
by supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization
tandem mass spectrometry. MBQ-167 was rapidly distributed into the
kidneys after intraperitoneal dosing, whereas oral administration
resulted in higher distribution to lungs. The elimination half-lives
were 2.17 and 2.6 h for the intraperitoneal and oral dosing, respectively.
The relative bioavailability of MBQ-167 after oral administration
was 35%. This investigation presents the first analysis of the pharmacokinetics
of MBQ-167 and supports further preclinical evaluation of this drug
as a potential anticancer therapeutic.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
Rho GTPases Rac and Cdc42 regulate cell functions governing
metastatic processes such as migration/invasion, tumor growth, angiogenesis,
cell cycle progression, and oncogenic transformation. Accordingly,
numerous studies have shown that Rac and Cdc42 are hyperactivated
in multiple human cancers.1−4 Hence, targeting of these pivotal regulators is a
rational approach for innovative antimetastasis focused therapy design.
Recently, we developed the small molecule MBQ-167 as an effective
Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor, which is 10 times more potent than other currently
available inhibitors, with IC50s of 100 and 80 nM for Rac and Cdc42
activation, respectively.5,6 MBQ-167 treatment resulted
in a decrease in metastatic cancer cell viability and migration in
vitro, with concomitant inhibition of signaling to the Rac and Cdc42
downstream effector p21-activated kinase, an oncogene that has been
the target of anticancer drug development. In a mouse model of experimental
metastasis, MBQ-167 at 10 mg/kg body weight (BW) was effective at
reducing HER2-type mammary fat pad tumor growth and metastasis in
immunocompromised mice by ∼90 and ∼99%, respectively.5 Further preclinical efficacy experiments in mouse
models of experimental and spontaneous metastasis have demonstrated
the utility of MBQ-167 in inhibiting both primary tumor growth and
metastasis.

To continue developing MBQ-167 as a potential antimetastatic
drug,
it is imperative to gather comprehensive information on the pharmacokinetic
profile, which would explain the mechanisms of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination of the compound in the body. Moreover,
since this compound is a new drug, validated methods for its detection
in biological matrixes have yet to be established. Supercritical fluid
chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(SFC–MS/MS), which uses supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as the main component of the mobile phase, offers a series
of advantages such as rapid analysis times with no reduction in sensitivity
or efficiency.7−11 Recent studies have favorably highlighted this technology for lipophilic
compounds when compared to conventional methods like liquid (LC–MS)
and gas chromatography (GC–MS).12,13 Moreover,
SFC is an environmentally friendly technique due to its use of less
organic solvents. These advantages have rendered SFC-coupled MS/MS
as a rapid and sensitive analytical method for pharmacokinetic applications.14−16

In this study, we developed and validated an SFC–MS/MS
bioanalytical
method to quantify the Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor MBQ-167 in mouse plasma
and tissues. We applied this method to investigate the pharmacokinetics
and tissue distribution in Balb/C mice following a single intraperitoneal
(IP) or oral (PO) administration of MBQ-167.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of Chromatographic
and Mass Spectrometry
Conditions
The mass spectrometry and chromatographic conditions
were first optimized for the analysis of MBQ-167. Figure 1A shows the positive electrospray
ionization mass spectrum of MBQ-167, in which the precursor ion of
[M + H] + 1 = 339.1 and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) ions >179.9,
282.1 can be observed in the positive ionization mode. The ion 179.9
was used for quantitative analysis, and the ion 282.1 was used for
qualitative analysis. To obtain the highest intensity of fragment
ions, the parameters optimized included the electrospray ionization
(ESI) source temperature, desolvation temperature, capillary and cone
voltage, collision energy, and flow rate of the desolvation gas and
cone gas. Mass spectrometry parameters were optimized by direct flow
infusion analysis of the MBQ-167 standard solution.

ionization product ion spectra of MBQ-167.
(B) Total ion chromatograms of MBQ-167 (Tr = 2.37 min) and EHop-0036
(Tr = 4.32 min). Multiple reaction monitoring chromatograms (m/z 339.1 > 179.9) of (C) blank plasma
sample, (D) MBQ-167 at 1.5 ng/mL in mouse plasma, (E) blank liver
sample, and (F) MBQ-167 at 10 ng/mL in the mouse liver.

Several ratios of sCO2 and methanol (MeOH)/0.01%
formic
acid were used to optimize elution from the chromatographic column
(95:5, 96:4, 97:3, v/v), where 95:5 ratio provided the optimum response.
A column temperature of 40 °C was selected since it resulted
in a better peak shape and a suitable elution time. Other parameters
that were optimized included backpressure and isocratic pump flow
rate. In addition, the use of 100% methanol as an injection solvent
gave the best response when compared to heptane/2-propanol (9:1),
acetonitrile (ACN)/methanol (4:1), ethanol 100%, and acetonitrile
100%. Under optimum conditions, MBQ-167 was detected at a retention
time of 2.37 min (Figure 1B).

2.2 Optimization of Sample
Preparation
We compared several organic solvents and extraction
methods to determine
the optimal extraction procedure of MBQ-167 from mouse plasma and
tissues. In plasma, a greater MBQ-167 recovery was observed after
protein precipitation with 100% ACN in comparison with MeOH and a
mixture containing MeOH/ACN (1:1). Hence, ACN (100%) was chosen for
the plasma extractions since it provided minimal interference, low
matrix effects, and high sensitivity. For tissue sample purification,
liquid–liquid extraction with a mixture of heptane:ethyl acetate
(1:1) resulted in a higher and consistent recovery of MBQ-167 (Figure S1A).

2.3 Internal
Standard (IS)
After screening
various compounds, we selected the small molecule EHop-0036 as an
internal standard for method validation because of its structural
similarity to MBQ-167 and similar chromatographic properties (Figure 1). Both compounds
MBQ-167 and EHop-0036 are 1,5-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole derivatives
with a carbazole moiety at 1-position and an aromatic ring at 5-position.
However, the simple phenyl ring at the 5-position in MBQ-167 was replaced
with a 3-pyridyl ring in EHop-0036. In addition, EHop-0036 did not
interfere with the elution of MBQ-167 (Figure 1B).

2.4 Method Validation
2.4.1 Selectivity
We compared the chromatograms
of six independent sources of blank mouse plasma with the sample plasma
spiked with 1.5 ng/mL MBQ-167 (Figure 1C,D). We observed no significant interferences at the
measured mass transition (m/z 339.1
179.9). Similarly, no interferences were seen after the analysis of
blank and spiked mouse livers (Figure 1E,F).

2.4.2 Linearity
Linearity
was determined
for both plasma and liver matrixes. Calibration curves were evaluated
using a weighting factor of 1/x. The dynamic ranges
established were 1.5–1000 and 10–1000 ng/mL for mouse
plasma and liver, respectively (Figure S2). Linearity was also observed in the same range as liver (10–1000
ng/mL) for kidneys, hearts, and lungs (Figure S2C–E). Our method proved to be highly sensitive for
the detection of MBQ-167 in plasma and tissue samples with lower limits
of quantification (LLOQ) of 1.5 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. This method
has a higher sensitivity in plasma than a UHPLC-MS/MS method that
our group previously developed for the detection of EHop-016, which
is a small molecule Rac inhibitor that shares high structural similarity
with MBQ-167.17

2.4.3 Accuracy
and Precision
We validated
the method accuracy and precision for intraday and interday analyses.
The intraday and interday accuracy results (relative error, RE%) for
MBQ-167 in plasma ranged from 2.1 to 13.2% and 4.4 to 5.3%, respectively.
The intraday and interday precision results (relative standard deviation,
RSD%) for MBQ-167 in plasma ranged from 6.4 to 10.9% and 5.8 to 13.7%,
respectively (Table 1). The validated method was also very accurate and precise for the
detection of MBQ-167 in mouse liver, with samples within the acceptable
criteria of ±15% (RE and RSD),18 which
indicated that the method was accurate, reliable, and reproducible.

2.4.4 Matrix and Recovery Effects
Plasma
and tissues contain a mixture of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids,
and other components, which could affect sample quantification, leading
to matrix effects. As shown in Table 1, endogenous substances did not significantly interfere
with the detection of our drug in plasma and livers since the percent
matrix effects ranged from 78 to 96% and 94 to 111% for mouse plasma
and liver, respectively. In addition, the observed recovery of MBQ-167
after extraction was consistent, ranging from 52 to 64% in plasma
and 60 to 73% in the liver with a coefficient of variation of <15%.
As demonstrated in Figure S1B,C, the recovery
percent and matrix effect in kidneys, hearts, and lungs are very similar
to those in the liver. Hence, the method that was validated for the
extraction of MBQ-167 in livers was successfully applied to other
organs.

2.4.5 Stability
We investigated the stability
of MBQ-167 in mouse plasma and liver under different conditions (Table 1). Results show that
MBQ-167 was stable (±15% RSD, RE) in plasma after incubation
at ambient temperature for four hours, whereas long-term stabilities
at −80 °C were 15 and 134 days for low and high drug concentrations,
respectively. Increased drug intermolecular interactions is a possible
explanation for greater stability in high-concentration samples since
these samples contain a higher number of drug molecules, which could
stabilize themselves by interacting with one another. In tissues,
MBQ-167 was stable after incubation in an ice bucket for 3 h, whereas
the long-term stability at −80 °C was 90 days for both
low and high concentrations of quality control samples. For both,
plasma and tissues, MBQ-167 was stable after three freeze–thaw
cycles lasting 24 h, whereas the postpreparative stability in autosampler
conditions was 8 h at 4 °C. These combined results support the
robust stability of MBQ-167.

2.5 Plasma
Pharmacokinetics
We applied
this newly developed and validated SFC-MS/MS method to investigate
the pharmacokinetics of MBQ-167 in an in vivo mouse model following
intraperitoneal (IP) and per oral (PO) administrations. As shown in Figure 2A, the maximum plasma
drug concentration (Cmax) was 2,969 ng/mL
after IP administration. As expected, the plasma drug concentration
was lower (∼4.5 times) after PO administration compared to
the corresponding dosage given by IP administration. Furthermore,
the time-to-peak concentrations were 0.22 and 0.5 h for IP and PO
administrations, respectively. MBQ-167 rapid absorption into the bloodstream
shows a similar pattern to other previously reported anticancer small
molecules.17,20,21

or mice treated only with 10 mg/kg BW MBQ-167 for 30 min. Mean standard
error of mean (SEM).

The pharmacokinetic profile
of MBQ-167 in plasma was evaluated
by both compartmental and noncompartmental analyses, and a higher
correlation was observed following noncompartmental assessment (Figure S3). Pharmacokinetic parameters corresponding
to each average disposition profile are summarized in Table 2. The systemic drug exposures
as measured by the area under the curve (AUC0–t) were 1,635 and 585 ng h/mL for IP and PO dosings,
respectively. When compared to the related molecule EHop-016, MBQ-167
reached higher plasma peak concentrations (Cmax) as well as a greater drug exposure (AUC) in both administration
routes with the same dose (10 mg/kg BW).17 The relative bioavailability (F) of MBQ-167 after
oral gavage administration was 35%, which is slightly lower than that
reported for other anticancer drugs, such as lapatinib (F = 43–50%) and EHop-016 (F = 40%).17,21 However, other Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small
molecules for advanced breast cancer treatment, such as everolimus
and paclitaxel, have significantly lower bioavailability (∼5
and ∼11%, respectively).22−24

The elimination half-lives (t1/2) were
2.17 h for IP dosing and 2.6 h for PO administration. The mean residence
time (MRT) and elimination half-life values of MBQ-167 show relatively
rapid elimination of this drug from mouse plasma. These results are
consistent with other reports of Rac inhibitors being rapidly eliminated
from plasma.17,25 For example, the T1/2 of the Rac inhibitor EHT1864 is 1.65 h, which is less
than the 2.17–2.6 h T1/2 of MBQ-167.25 Rapid systemic clearances of the drug were also
observed with a similar range for both routes of administration (129
and 390 mL/h for IP and PO, respectively). Once adjusted by the corresponding
F value, both the volume of distribution (491 mL) and systemic clearance
(136.5 mL/h) of MBQ-167 after PO administration nearly resembled those
for the IP input. Notably, the systemic clearance of MBQ-167 was estimated
to be ∼5 L/(h kg) (i.e., 130 mL/h in a mouse weighing 20–25
g), which exceeds the mean basal renal glomerular filtration rate
in mice (i.e., ∼7–11 μL/(min g) or 12–18
mL/h) by ∼10-fold. This clearance rate is ∼85% of the
liver blood flow in the mouse. Taken together, these values suggest
that MBQ-167 may be removed from the mouse by a combination of elimination
mechanisms that include both renal and hepatic pathways.

The
volumes of distribution (Vz/F) of MBQ-167 were 399 and 1403 mL for ip and po administrations,
respectively. Given an estimated total blood volume of 1.5–2.0
mL in a mouse of 20–25 g, the “apparent” volume
of distribution of MBQ-167 in mice (∼400 mL) suggests there
was a substantial binding or penetration of this drug into peripheral
tissues with less than 1% remaining in the bloodstream.

2.6 Tissue Distribution
Concentrations
of MBQ-167 were determined in the liver, lung, spleen, kidneys, and
heart from BALB/c mice at different postdose time points. Figure 2B,C shows the cumulative
tissue drug levels over time, following IP or PO administration of
MBQ-167. After IP administration, the highest concentrations of MBQ-167
were detected in kidneys, reflecting a pivotal role of renal uptake
and subsequent clearance in drug disposition. Figure 2D,E shows the tissue localization index,
as determined by the ratio of cumulative levels of MBQ-167 found in
tissues when compared to plasma. At 3 h postintraperitoneal dose,
MBQ-167 was detected in the kidneys at a ∼40 times higher concentration
than in plasma. Although IP administration is expected to bypass the
first-pass liver extraction, similar levels of MBQ-167 and their corresponding
hepatic distribution patterns were observed after both IP and PO administrations,
indicating that hepatic metabolism is also involved.

As expected,
the oral gavage group showed a different pattern of distribution,
where MBQ-167 is absorbed from the GI tract and passed through the
portal-hepatic vein system into the liver for processing before reaching
the systemic circulation. In the case of oral administration of MBQ-167,
a higher distribution was observed in the lungs, peaking at 0.5 h
following administration (Figure 2D). As shown in Figure 2E, the amount of MBQ-167 detected in the lungs was
significantly higher than in plasma at similar times. This difference
and high variability can be due to the route of administration. In
our study, the mice were fed ad libitum before oral gavage, which
could have caused differences in the stomach contents at the time
of dosing, increasing their risk for gavage-related reflux and aspiration
of the drug formulation, as previously reported in rodents.26 Nonetheless, high AUC in the lungs after oral
gavage in mice has also been observed with other FDA-approved small
molecules used for breast cancer treatment, such as lapatinib.27

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the pharmacokinetic
tissue distribution
parameters of MBQ-167 for IP and PO dosing, respectively, after noncompartmental
analysis (NCA). For IP, the rank order of tissue drug exposure,
as determined by AUC, was kidney> liver> spleen> lung>
heart, and
a similar pattern was observed for maximum MBQ-167 concentration (Cmax)
(Table 3). Half-lives
of MBQ-167 ranged from 0.97 ± 0.12 h in the heart to 2.24 ±
0.81 h in the liver. For PO, higher MBQ-167 exposure was seen in the
lungs, followed by liver, kidneys, spleen, and heart. Half-lives ranged
from 0.89 ± 0.18 h (lungs) up to 11 ± 3 h (spleen) (Table 4).

2.7 MBQ-167
Tumor Distribution
To determine
MBQ-167 distribution to tumors, mammary fat pad tumors were established
from the MDA-MB-468 triple-negative breast cancer cell line in SCID
mice. Following tumor homogenization and purification, MBQ-167 was
detected by our method in only the two subgroups (n = 5) that received the drug 30 min prior to sacrifice (Figure 2F). The MBQ-167 concentration
was slightly higher in the subgroup that received multiple low doses
of MBQ-167 (2.5 mg/kg BW) over 3 months followed by 10 mg/kg BW MBQ-167
30 min prior to sacrifice (382.5 ng/g± 59; mean ±SEM) compared
to the single-dose subgroup (234.6 ng/g± 33). The amount of MBQ-167
detected in tumors in the single-dose subgroup was lower than the
mean drug concentration in plasma (839.92 ng/mL), liver (4565 ng/g),
kidneys (10,528.72 ng/g), heart (796.96 ng/g) spleen (1622 ng/g),
and lungs (14,46.88 ng/g) at 30 min postdose via IP (Figure S4). Even though tumor drug levels were below those
seen in plasma and other tissues, previous studies have demonstrated
that the plasma concentration does not necessarily correlate with
the antitumor effect. For example, in a study with 5-fluorouracil,
tumor levels were below those observed in plasma and it was noted
that these amounts could not be correlated with the antitumor effect
of the drug.28

As expected, MBQ-167
was not detected in the subgroup that received only the vehicle treatments.
The drug was also not detected in the subgroup that received 2.5 mg/kg
BW MBQ-167 24 h prior to sacrifice, as part of a 3-month regimen of
multiple low-dose inputs. This is not surprising because MBQ-167 was
eliminated from plasma and tissues ∼6–8 h following
administration by both routes. Nonetheless, the administration of
MBQ-167 three times a week for ∼60 days still significantly
reduces tumor growth and metastasis in immunocompromised mice bearing
tumors from human breast cancer cells, as previously published by
our group.5 Further studies are needed
to characterize the tumor pharmacokinetics of MBQ-167 and to determine
the exact length of time that MBQ-167 remains in tumors after administration.

3 Conclusions
The Rho GTPases, Rac and Cdc42,
are viable antimetastatic cancer
targets since their activation promotes survival, proliferation, and
invasion/migration of cancer cells.4 So
far, no dual or single Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors have entered clinical
trials.29 However, the dual Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor
MBQ-167 shows promise as an antimetastatic breast cancer compound
by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models.5 The aim of this study was to elucidate the pharmacokinetics
of the dual Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor MBQ-167, which is imperative for dose
regimen design and further development of clinical trials. We developed
a rapid, sensitive, and selective supercritical fluid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry method for the detection of MBQ-167 in mouse plasma
and tissues. This is the first analytical method that has been developed
for the detection of MBQ-167 in a biological matrix and successfully
applied in a pharmacokinetic study. This drug is highly distributed
to tissues and rapidly eliminated; hence, strategies to optimize drug
formulation to increase the drug half-life should be considered in
future studies.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Organic LC/MS-grade solvents
acetonitrile (ACN) and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Saint Louis, MO). Sodium chloride, ethyl acetate, heptane, and all
materials required for compound synthesis were also purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO). Formic acid was purchased from Fisher
(Fair Lawn, NJ). Nonsterile mouse plasma containing sodium citrate
was from Equitech-Bio, Inc (Kerrville, TX). Mouse livers used in method
validation were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
MBQ-167 and EHop-0036 (Figure 1) were used as analytical standards, and MBQ-167 was synthesized
as previously described by us.5 The synthesis
of EHop-0036 is described in Figure S5.
Purity (>98%) was verified by thin layer chromatography, NMR spectroscopy,
and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).

4.2 Instrumentation
The analysis was
performed on an Acquity UPC2 system (Waters Corp., Milford,
MA), coupled to a triple quadrupole MS/MS. The separation was performed
on an Acquity UPC2 BEH (3.0 × 100 mm2,
1.7 μm) with sCO2 and methanol/0.01% formic acid
as the mobile phase at a rate of 1.0 mL/min, whereas 0.01% formic
acid in methanol was used as the makeup solvent at a flow rate of
0.15 mL/min. The gradient elution of A (sCO2) and B (methanol/0.01%
formic acid) was performed as follows: 5% B maintained at 0–1.5
min, 5–12% B at 1.5–2 min, 12% B at 2–3 min,
12–20% B at 3–3.5 min, 20% B at 3.5–4.5 min,
20–5% B at 4.5–5 min, and 5% B at 5–6 min. The
backpressure of the system was kept at 2200 psi, and the column temperature
was maintained at 40 °C. The autosampler was conditioned at 4
°C. The total run time for analysis was 6 min, and the injection
volume was 1.0 μL.

The mass analysis and detection were
conducted using a Waters ACQUITY Tandem Quadrupole Detector (TQD)
(Waters Corp., Milford, MA) with an ESI interface. The ESI source
was operated in the positive ionization mode. The source temperature
was set at 150 °C, and the desolvation temperature was kept at
200 °C, whereas the capillary voltage was 3.90 kV for MBQ-167
and the Internal Standard (IS) EHop-0036. The cone voltage was maintained
at 66.0 V for MBQ-167 and 42.0 V for the IS. The collision energies
of MBQ-167 and IS were 32.0 and 16.0 V, respectively. The cone flow
and nitrogen flow rates were set at 1 and 650 L/h, respectively, and
instrument control and data acquisition were carried out using MassLynx
software with a TargetLynx program (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). MBQ-167
with a precursor ion [M + H]+ = 339.12 and EHop-0036 with
a precursor ion [M + H]+ = 340.1 were used as analytical
standards monitoring the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions
[M + H]+ = 339.12 > 179.9 and 339.12 > 282.1 for
MBQ-167
and [M + H]+ = 340.14 > 312.8 for EHop-0036, respectively.
The analysis required the ratio between the quantitative ion (179.9)
and the qualifier ion (282.1) of MBQ-167 to be within ±10% to
meet the criterion for a positive result. Nitrogen (99.95%) was used
as a sheath gas.

4.3 Plasma Sample Extraction
Plasma samples
were extracted by a standard protein precipitation method (Figure S6A). A total of 200 μL of plasma
was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. When appropriate, 50 μL
of the internal standard (from working solution 2000 ng/mL prepared
in 4:1 ACN:MeOH) was added to the sample. Proteins in the matrix were
precipitated by the addition of 550 μL of cold ACN and vortexed
for 10 min using a VWR Analog Vortex Mixer. Samples were then centrifuged
for 10 min at 1000g at 4 °C using a VWR Galaxy
16 microcentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and dried using
a Labconco Centrivap console. Dried samples were reconstituted by
adding 200 μL of 100% MeOH solution, vortexed for 10 min, and
centrifuged at 1000g for 1 min. Samples were transferred
to autosampler vials, sealed, and injected onto the UPC2 system.

4.4 Tissue Sample Extraction
Tissue samples
were extracted by the liquid–liquid extraction method (Figure S6B). Stored organs were thawed, weighed
(100 mg), and homogenized using the Polytron PT 2100 instrument in
pH 7.4 saline (1:4 w/v).30 Similarly to
refs,31,32 the tissue homogenate (100 μL) was
transferred to another tube, followed by addition of the internal
standard (10 μL from 4500 ng/mL stock), and vortexed for 30
s. Subsequently, 100 μL of NaOH 0.5 M was added to the mixture
and vortexed for 5 min. A liquid–liquid extraction was performed
using 790 μL of heptane/ethyl acetate (1:1). Samples were then
vortexed for 10 min and later centrifuged for 5 min at 510g. The upper layer was recovered, and the solvent was evaporated
for one hour in a Labconco Centrivap console at room temperature.
Afterward, samples were reconstituted with 100 μL of methanol,
vortexed for 10 min, and centrifuged at 1000g for
1 min. Samples were then transferred to an autosampler vial to be
analyzed by SFC-MS/MS.

4.5 Method Validation
This method was
validated following the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Bioanalytical
Method Validation Guide.18

4.5.1 Preparation of Standard Solutions, Plasma
and Tissue Calibrators, and Quality Controls
A primary stock
solution of the MBQ-167 analyte (2 mg/mL) was prepared by dissolving
10 mg of the analyte in an acetonitrile:methanol (4:1) mixture. A
stock solution of the EHop-0036 internal standard (2 mg/mL) was prepared
in the same manner. Analyte stock solutions were stored in the dark
at −20 °C. The internal standard EHop-0036 working solutions
(2000 and 4500 ng/mL) were prepared from a 20 000 ng/mL stock
in an acetonitrile:methanol (4:1) mixture. Working solutions of MBQ-167
in methanol were prepared using 20 000 and 50 000 ng/mL
stock solutions.

For plasma, calibration curves were prepared
using working solutions of MBQ-167 at 1.5, 5, 25, 100, 350, 500, and
1000 ng/mL in mouse plasma. Standard solutions were prepared by diluting
primary stock solutions in mouse plasma. Quality control (QC) samples
were prepared using working solutions to obtain the desired concentrations
of 2.5, 450, and 950 ng/mL. Plasma samples were prepared individually
by adding 50 μL of internal standard (from working solution
2000 ng/mL) to 200 μL of plasma solution spiked with MBQ-167,
followed by extraction, as described above.

For tissues, calibration
curves were prepared using 10, 20, 40,
62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 ng/mL of MBQ-167. Standard solutions
were prepared by diluting primary stock solutions in methanol. QC
samples were prepared using working solutions to obtain the desired
concentrations of 15, 450, and 950 ng/mL. Each tissue sample was prepared
by adding 10 μL of the corresponding MBQ-167 stock solution
in methanol and 10 μL of the internal standard (from 4500 ng/mL
stock) to 100 μL of the tissue homogenate, followed by extraction,
as described above.

4.5.2 Accuracy and Precision
The intraday
precision and accuracy were measured by comparing three calculated
QC concentrations (six replicates per concentration level) against
their nominal concentrations in one batch. The interday precision
and accuracy were measured by comparing the three calculated QC concentrations
(six replicates per concentration level) from three independent batches
run on separate days. The accuracy and precision of the method were
described by percent relative error (RE%) and relative standard deviation
(RSD%), respectively. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was
defined as the lowest concentration that could be determined with
both RE and RSD within ±20%.

4.5.3 Selectivity
Selectivity was evaluated
using six independent sources of blank mouse plasma and blank mouse
tissue and the resulting chromatograms compared with
plasma and tissue samples spiked with MBQ-167 at the LLOQ.

4.5.4 Recovery and Matrix Effects
The
recovery of MBQ-167 was measured in spiked mouse plasma and tissue
at three QC concentrations based upon six replicates and compared
to that of MBQ-167 in 100% methanol at the same concentrations. Recovery
was calculated by comparing the peak areas of blank biological samples
spiked before extraction to those of the samples in which the analyte
was added after extraction. The matrix effect was evaluated by comparing
the peak areas of the blank matrix spiked after extraction to those
of pure standard solutions.

4.5.5 Stability
MBQ-167 stability in
plasma and tissues was measured under several storage conditions.
For plasma, the short-term stability (2.5 and 950 ng/mL) was evaluated
for 4 h at room temperature. The postpreparation response of the three
QC concentrations was determined after 10 h at 4 °C. The long-term
stability was evaluated after storing the samples at −80 °C
after 15 and 134 days.

For tissues, the short-term stability
was evaluated by leaving the QC samples with the lowest and highest
concentrations (15 and 950 ng/mL) at a benchtop for 3 h in an ice
bucket. The postpreparative stability for the three QC concentrations
(15, 450, and 950 ng/mL) was determined after 8 h at 4 °C. The
long-term stability was evaluated after storing the samples at −80
°C after 90 days. The freeze–thaw stability at −80
°C was evaluated for three 24 h cycles.

4.6 Animal Protocol
All experimental
procedures were conducted under an approved protocol #A8180117 by
The University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), in accordance with the principles
and procedures outlined in the NIH Guideline for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals.33 Four to five-week-old
female BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Inc. Wilmington, MA)
were housed under pathogen-free conditions in HEPA-filtered cages
and kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle and controlled temperature (22–24
°C) and humidity (25%). Food and water were given ad libitum.
After one-week acclimation, animals were treated with MBQ-167. MBQ-167
was prepared as a stock solution of 2 mg/mL in cremophor/ethanol/PBS
(12.5:12.5:75) solution. A total of 90 BALB/c mice were used in the
pharmacokinetic study, with five mice per group.

4.6.1 Pharmacokinetic
Study
For the analysis
of MBQ-167 bioavailability, each mouse was administered a single 0.1
mL dose of MBQ-167 (in 12.5% ethanol, 12.5% cremophor, 75% phosphate-buffered
saline, pH 7.4) that corresponded to 10 mg/kg by IP injection or oral
gavage (PO). Following treatment, five mice per group were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation at 0.08, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 12
h. Blood (∼1.0 mL) was rapidly collected by cardiac puncture
exsanguination and transferred into sodium citrate buffer tubes on
ice. After centrifuging at 16 000g for 20
min at 4 °C, plasma was then recovered and stored at −80
°C until analysis. The livers, heart, spleen, kidneys, and lungs
were rapidly collected from each animal at different time points (0.17,
0.5, 1, and 3 h after drug administration), flushed with normal saline,
individually wrapped in an aluminum foil, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored frozen at −80 °C until use. The time intervals
for collecting tissues were shorter than those for the plasma collections
because we wanted to ascertain the tissue distribution of MBQ-167
in a broad and humane fashion while sacrificing a minimal number of
mice.

4.6.2 Distribution of MBQ-167 in Mouse Mammary
Tumors
A total of 20 female SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Inc. Wilmington, MA), 4-week-old, were injected with 2 × 106 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MDA-MB-468 human breast
cancer cells at the mammary fat pad under isoflurane inhalation (1–3%
in oxygen using an inhalation chamber at 2 L/min) to produce primary
tumors, as described.34 After tumor establishment
(1 week later), 10 mice per group were treated with either vehicle
or MBQ-167 (2.5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal (ip) injections, three
times a week for 3 months. After 24 h of the last treatment, a single
dose of MBQ-167 (10 mg/kg BW) was administered to five mice from the
vehicle group and five mice of the treated group for 30 min prior
to sacrifice. Following sacrifice, tumors were flushed with normal
saline, individually wrapped in an aluminum foil, snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored frozen at −80 °C until use.

4.6.3 Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Distribution
Data Analysis
All experimental data were expressed as a mean
from five animals per each time-point. Data analysis was performed
by noncompartmental analysis (NCA), according to a uniform weighing
scheme, using Phoenix WinNonlin professional software, Version 8.1
(Certara Inc., 2018, NJ). The area under the curves (AUCs) for the
tissue or plasma concentrations over time were determined using the
linear–log linear trapezoidal rule. The largest adjusted regression
was selected to estimate lambda z, with one caveat: if the adjustment
did not improve, but was within 0.0001 of the largest value, the regression
with a larger number of points was used. Lambda z is the first-order rate constant associated with the terminal (log
linear) segment of the curve, as estimated by linear regression. Parameters
extrapolated to infinity using the moments of the curves were all
computed based on the last predicted value. We calculated the mean
percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue [%ID/g] at the time
points indicated above. To this purpose, a standard dose was used
to determine 100% (total) amount of entire dose administration. The
corresponding indexes of localization (IL) were calculated as the
tissue-to-plasma ratios of the previously calculated %ID per gram
of tissue and per milliliter of plasma.
