Forest is one of nature’s
most generous gifts to human beings,
providing materials and shelters for all living beings with over 30%
global land coverage. Apart from being sustainable, biodegradable,
and renewable, wood is also extremely fascinating from the application
aspect, with numerous advantages including hierarchical and macroporous
structure, excellent mechanical performance, and versatile chemistry.
The macroporous structure of wood is comprised of numerous long, partially
aligned channels along the growth direction. This structure is suitable
for a range of emerging applications, especially as a separation/membrane
material. In this research, the potentiality of Gingko biloba (Gb)
wood in the remediation of wastewater, contaminated with methylene
blue (MB), a dye found in the industrial waters, was investigated.
We report a macroporous, three-dimensional (3D) Gb-wood membrane decorated
with palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) for efficient wastewater treatment.
The efficiency of the Pd NPs/Gb-wood membrane to remove MB from a
flowing aqueous solution was demonstrated. The wastewater treatment
rate of the 3D Pd NPs/Gb-wood membrane can reach 0.5 L/min, with a
high MB removal efficiency (>99.9%). The 3D Gb-wood macroporous
membrane
with partially aligned channels exhibits promising results for water
treatment and is applicable for an even wider range of separation
applications. In addition, the benefit of this 3D-wood membrane system
for wastewater treatment was evaluated against the potential impacts
on the environment and human health by employing the life-cycle assessment
(LCA) approach. The LCA was carried out using the Gabi-education version
with the gate-to-grave approach, including industrial wastewater,
3D-wood membrane, and electricity consumption using CML (Centrum VoorMilieukunde
Leiden). From the LCA, it can be observed that wastewater filtration
using this membrane exhibited a better environmental footprint due
to the improved performance of the membrane in treating a higher volume
of the permeate. Therefore, this filtration system had outweighed
the additional environmental impact of the wastewater treatment process.
The energy demand was identified as the main environmental hotspot
in the LCA analysis. The analysis revealed that the energy source
for electricity generation had a significant influence on the overall
sustainability of this system. Additionally, the wood itself, a naturally
abundant and eco-friendly material, presented zero environmental hazard
to the environment during the filtration process. The experimental
and environmental impact results indicate that Gb-wood can be employed
as a natural and eco-friendly adsorbent material for the removal of
waste from aqueous solutions.

Introduction
Population increase
initiates rapid industrialization which was
found to consequently increase the domestic wastewater and effluents
into the aquatic ecosystem. Dyes are used today more than ever in
industries such as textiles, printing, paper, rubber, pulp mills,
cosmetics, plastics, leather tanning, food processing, etc.1−3 In recent years, the worldwide consumption of dyes has surpassed
700 000 tons annually, and approximately 10–20% is discharged
into water.4 Most of these dyes are released
into the aquatic environment, which are toxic and even carcinogenic
to humans, causing serious threats to the environment in the long
run.4−6 Therefore, it is necessary to urgently treat the dye-contaminated
wastewaters before they are released into the environment. A variety
of technologies, including chemical oxidation, physical adsorption,
photocatalytic degradation, and membrane filtration, have been implemented
for wastewater treatment.7−10 However, these water treatment methods result in
additional challenges such as excessive production of solid waste
and low efficiencies.11 Therefore, there
is an urgent demand for methods that are efficient, rapid, recyclable,
cost-effective, and eco-friendly for removing dyes from industrial
wastewater.

Wood-derived nanomaterials have been successfully
prepared and
are well suited to expand its application to various fields such as
energy, biomedicine, and environment. Beyond biodegradability and
abundance, wood does not contribute to net CO2 increase
due to cyclic carbon fixation during photosynthesis and release during
degradation making it a carbon-neutral material. Therefore, wood has
been considered as a potential replacement for carbon-based materials
to support environmental sustainability. For example, nanomaterials
extracted from wood such as cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals
have attracted much attention due to their mechanical and optical
properties for their potential applications. However, directly engineering
natural wood can potentially open up a range of opportunities.12 In this way, the hierarchical wood structure,
the internal nanoscale nature, is preserved and utilized, yielding
high efficiency without any intensive extraction process.

In
this study, we use Ginkgo biloba (Gb) which has served mankind
for more than 2000 years and is considered a “living fossil”.
Gingko wood has a macroporous structure with long and partially aligned
channels, inspiring engineers and scientists to design porous materials
utilizing its internal structure and mechanical properties.13−15 It is a natural material with honeycomb-like cells, high strength/stiffness
to weight ratio, and high value for hierarchical order. It is estimated
that Gb wood is comprised of about 80% (pore volume) of fiber channels,
making it a suitable candidate for wastewater treatment and transportation
through complex pipelike channels. In addition, Gb wood is of low
cost, is environmentally friendly, readily processed, and can be conveniently
engineered.

Herein, we report the preparation of robust, macroporous
three-dimensional
(3D) wood structures for wastewater treatment. The native Gb wood
is used directly as a template, decorated with palladium nanoparticles
(Pd NPs) by embedding the NPs or inserting into the lumen space or
into wood cell walls.14,16,17 The Pd NPs have shown excellent catalytic efficiency, where materials
are often synthesized on nanoporous supports such as silica, zeolite
cages, metal oxides, and carbon to avoid agglomeration.18 The wood 3D substrate supports the in situ formation
of Pd NPs, which is composed of long, irregularly shaped wood channels
with varying diameter along the growth direction. Hence, the naturally
abundant and naturally developed Gb-wood membrane is more advantageous
owing to its biodegradability as well as high flux rate, making it
a better candidate than the fabricated ceramic and polymeric membranes
for sustainable development.

Furthermore, the environmental
impact of this 3D Gb-wood-based
filtration process was evaluated by employing the life-cycle assessment
(LCA) approach.19 In LCA, by accumulating
a set of inventories that is relevant to the inputs and outputs of
the objects studied, the process evaluates the impact of a system/product
starting from its raw material to production until its end of life
toward the sustainable environment and human health.20 The study takes place in four necessary steps: goal and
scope definition, LC inventory analysis (LCI), LC impact assessment
(LCIA) followed by interpretation.21 The
environmental impacts were evaluated using the gate-to-grave approach
by CML with an endpoint indicator.

LCA has attracted tremendous
attention among environmental and
water-treatment-related fields and researchers because of its holistic
approach. Studies have been conducted to compare different water treatment
processes such as conventional treatment versus reverse osmosis, nanofiltration
process, etc.22,23 However, these comparative LCA
studies between different treatment processes are still insufficient
for public administrations, individuals, business, and policymakers.

Previously, most of the LCA studies were on nano-based products,
while few of them were on nanotechnological production methods. To
the best of our knowledge, no LCA study has been conducted to investigate
the impacts of Gb-wood-based composite membranes. Therefore, this
study aims at investigating the benefits of using a Gb-wood membrane
to identify the most environment-friendly setup for wastewater treatment.
Also, the Pd NPs/wood 3D membrane demonstrated in this study can be
readily scaled up for industrial-scale applications. The effects on
all of the impact categories in the filtration process stage were
evaluated in detail, and further recommendations were made. To determine
the most environment-friendly treatment systems based on nanotechnology,
these results may be used as a reference for future wastewater treatment
projects.

Results and Discussion
The macroporous structure of
Gb wood is unbelievably suitable for
water treatment shown in Figure 1. The internal structure of Gb wood is comprised of
numerous pits and well-distributed channels (Figure 1b). The pits and spiral thickenings are decorated
on the inner surface of the long channels.13,16 These characteristics are crucial in wastewater treatment for determining
the kinetics when water passes through these complex channels. All
of these structural characteristics of wood are well preserved in
Pd NPs/wood after uniform and conformal in situ Pd NP decoration.
The color change of the wood block from yellow to black/light green
is due to strong light absorption by the plasmonic effect of the Pd
metal NPs anchored at the surfaces of the wood channels (Figure 1c; also see the process
in the Supporting Information Figure S1).24 The Pd decoration of the 3D wood membrane
was also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), shown
in the Supporting Information Figure S3. The resulting Pd NPs/wood 3D membrane exhibits a powerful ability
for wastewater treatment, which is to be demonstrated by methylene
blue (MB) degradation characteristics.

Figure 1 (a) Digital image of
the Gb-wood block (3D membrane) before decorating
with Pd NPs, and the piece was cut perpendicular to the growth direction,
(b) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the mesostructure
of the wood, showing many channels aligned through the wood block’s
thickness, and (c) digital image of the Gb wood after the in situ
decoration of the Pd NP block appeared black.

In this experiment, MB containing water was modeled as wastewater.
MB concentration was varied to measure the waste removal efficiency
of the 3D NPs/wood membrane. As MB-contaminated water (wastewater)
passes through the Pd/wood membrane, degradation of MB takes place
resulting in MB-free water. The efficient MB degradation may be due
to two phenomena; (1) the presence of Pd NPs throughout the wood channels
serves as an efficient electron relay between the electrophilic MB
and nucleophilic NaBH4 for catalytic reduction following
the degradation process, (2) the irregular long channels and the perforation
plates within the wood membrane result in efficient contact between
the MB solution and the Pd NPs/wood membrane. This enables a highly
efficient reaction toward the degradation of MB. The degradation ability
of the 3D membrane toward MB is quantitatively confirmed by UV–vis
measurements as shown in Figure 2a. After the MB solution was treated with the wood
membrane, the characteristic absorbance band for MB (664 nm) completely
disappeared. It can be seen that in aqueous solution with MB content
less than 50 mg L–1, the removal efficiency was
nearly 100% (Figure 2b). As the concentration increases, the removal efficiency gradually
decreases reaching 54% for a very high concentration of 100 mg L–1. From these results, significantly high efficiency
is demonstrated, which is prominently higher than the previously reported
works with similar filtration systems.16 The wood membrane showed great performance for MB cleaning with
an efficiency of around 99.9% as shown quantitatively in Table 1.

The Gb-wood membrane also shows a
high water treatment rate while
maintaining high efficiency. The efficiency rate is evaluated by passing
the aqueous solution through this 3D wood membrane at various rates,
shown in Figure 2c.
There is a suction pump attached to the equipment at the filtrate
side, and by controlling the sucking via a manually controlled pressure
gauge, we can tailor the flow rate of the filtrate. The suction pump
increases the vacuum/air pressure in the chamber where the filtrate
is accumulated, so when the suck is low, the flow is low and vice
versa. It can be observed in the video shown in the Supporting information Video 1 (a filtration rate of 0.2 × 105 Lm–2 h–1 with an MB concentration
of 50 mg L–1) and Video 2 (a filtration rate of 1.5 × 105 Lm–2 h–1 with an MB concentration of 50 mg L–1) that the initial blue color solution became colorless after flowing
through the 3D wood membrane. A high degradation efficiency of 99.9%
was maintained for a flow rate of 0.5 L min–1 and
slowly decreased to more than 98% for a very high flow rate of 1 L
min–1. In addition, the NPs/Gb-wood membrane maintains
the high treatment efficiencies even for a wide range of pH variations
(Figure 2d). The cleaning
efficiency remains high (>99%) across all pH values ranging from
1
to 13, which is essential for industrial applications. The efficient
degradation of MB by the proposed 3D Gb-wood membrane may be ascribed
by two factors. First, the irregular and long channels within the
wood membrane result in intimate and efficient contact between the
MB solution and the Pd NPs/wood membrane. Second, the presence of
Pd NPs throughout the wood channels serves as an efficient electron
relay between electrophilic MB and nucleophilic NaBH4 for
the catalytic reduction–degradation process to occur, thus
enabling a highly efficient reaction toward the degradation of MB.

The promising water treatment performance of the Pd NPs/Gb-wood
membrane originates from the fluid dynamics induced by the macroporous
structure of the 3D wood as water passes through it. Figure 3 shows the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images illustrating the 3D mesostructure of Gb-wood,
where long, irregular vessel channels with nonuniform diameters travel
throughout the basswood. The vessel channels are connected by perforation
plates, highlighted by red dashed lines in Figure 3a,b. Furthermore, water flows through the
vessel pits in a more complex manner and exists inside the wood channels,
highlighted by yellow dashed lines in Figure 3c. Hence, the water flow can be changed by
tailoring the wood channels, e.g., the number of vessel pits and irregular
channel shapes with varying diameters. The water transport through
the wood channels is dictated by the vessel network in Gb-wood which
is a type of hardwood.25 In contrast, the
pits connecting the tapered ends of longitudinal cells are important
for water transport.26 The vessel network
in the hardwood consists of bundles of vessels that are weaved to
form a 3D network that dictates transport in longitudinal and tangential
directions. These perforated plates as well as porous vessel walls
interconnect the individual vessels to form this vessel network. In-depth
mechanism exploration involving water diffusive transport in such
a complicated vessel network is beyond the scope of this study.

channels are highlighted with red and yellow dashed lines. Vessel
pits within the Gb-wood are highlighted with white circular shapes.

Environmental Analysis
As the designed membranes used
in the system were not available in the Gabi-education open database,
the information of the system was created and the results were compared.
The functional unit for the 3D filtration membrane used was 30 ×
30 × 5 mm3, and the operational volume of the wastewater
was 1 L, with an MB concentration of 50 mg L–1.
Therefore, all of the raw material inputs were energy consumption
and wastewater. The system boundaries of the 3D wood-membrane unit
are illustrated in the schematics shown in Figure 4. The activities and components outside the
dotted line were not considered in the LCA. The influent water from
the environment and disposal to the environment were excluded.

unit for LCA analysis.

Wastewater
The
wastewater sources are assumed to be
the industrial wastewater in China, which is the byproduct of paper,
leather, plastic, textile, and other dye industries. All of these
industries release contaminated water (organic waste) with various
types of contaminants including dyes like methylene orange (MO) or
Rhodamine 6 G (Rh6G) and methylene blue (focused in this study). This
synthetic wastewater was prepared at different concentrations (10–50
mg L–1) for treatment (Table 2).

Operation of the Wastewater Treatment Unit
Emissions
of direct substances like methane, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide
were calculated using the emission factors defined by Chong et al.
for wastewater treatment using poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based
membranes.27 Our study is based on a similar
approach to the neat 3D Gb-wood membrane and its comparison with the
composite 3D wood-nanomaterial (palladium-incorporated Gb-wood).

Comparison of 3D Gb-Wood Membranes with and without Pd NPs
Figure 5 presents
the results of CML three endpoint indicators that consist of human
toxicity, acidification, and eutrophication. The 3D Gb-wood membrane
decorated with Pd nanoparticles showed significantly large effects
on all of the three categories compared to the neat wood membrane.
The total environmental footprint of the 3D wood membrane was 740
mPt L–1 of contaminated water. On the other hand,
the environmental footprint of the 3D wood membrane treated with nanoparticles
has reduced by 72%, to 1273 mPt L–1 of contaminated
water. This demonstrated that the nanoparticle incorporation into
the macroporous wood membrane was more environment friendly and showed
significantly encouraging results in reducing the environmental impacts.
As shown in Figure 5, acidification exhibited the highest impact, followed by human toxicity
and eutrophication for both of the membranes having similar trends
to the other studies (Table 3).28,29 The results could be interpreted
as that the system prevented environmental pollution due to the use
of fossil fuel which is the main source of energy generation.

It is assumed,
in China, that electricity is produced from hard
coal (bituminous and sub-bituminous).3,30−34 Also, it is assumed that a net calorific value of 11.3 MJ kg–1 coal, i.e., 319 g of hard coal, was needed to produce
1 kW h of electricity.35 These electricity-generation
units contain an average sulfur content of 1.01%, resulting in approximately
15.15 kg SO2/t coal.32 The coal
extraction, processing, burning, and waste disposal of this fossil
fuel deteriorated the environment in various forms (i.e., release
of toxic substances, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases). These
pollutants in turn come into contact with humans directly via food
intake or skin contact or indirectly via inhalation. Also, the continuous
extraction of fossil fuel would definitely lead to resource depletion
as coal, petroleum, and natural gas are nonrenewable energy sources
on earth. The use of 100% renewable energy grids such as geothermal,
hydropower, and solar photovoltaic will be able to mitigate the CO2 emission by more than 90% (Table 4).

Conclusions
We demonstrated a macroporous wood membrane decorated with palladium
(Pd) nanoparticle (NP)-based wastewater treatment unit, which imposed
a significantly positive effect on environmental sustainability. The
3D Gingko biloba (Gb) wood membrane can function as an excellent wastewater
treatment material, which is attributed to the channel structure of
the wood and the synergistic effect of the evenly distributed nanosized
catalyst particles. The wastewater used was an aqueous mixture of
NaBH4 and MB. The MB degradation efficiency reached 99.9%
at a treatment flow rate up to 0.5 L min–1. Additionally,
we also investigated the environmental effects of this filtration
process via life-cycle impact assessment (LCA) analysis. As a crucial
parameter in the LCA analysis, energy consumption was found to be
the main cause of environmental effects in this wood-membrane treatment
unit. The analysis shows that the used Gb-wood filter for wastewater
treatment presents no environmental hazardous effects. The estimated
effects on human health, acidification, and eutrophication arose from
the use of a mixed electricity grid, which is the main source of energy.
Therefore, it is suggested that efforts should be made to eradicate
the bottom cause of these effects by shifting the current electricity
mix toward renewable energy such as hydropower, fuel cell, solar photovoltaic,
and wind power in preventing environmental pollution while enjoying
the economic benefit.

Methodology
Experimental Section
Materials
and Chemicals
The Gb wood used in this study,
having an age of 30 years, was received from Taixing Company, Jiangsu,
China. Methylene blue (MB, C16H18N3ClS), deionized (DI) water, palladium (II) chloride (PdCl2), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), sodium borohydride (NaBH4), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from InnoChem (Beijing
InnoChem Science & Technology Co., Ltd., China) and used as received.

Preparation of 3D Pd NPs/Wood Membrane
The Pd nanoparticle
decoration of the wood block was adopted from the study by Chen et
al. with some modifications.16 An aqueous
solution (1.5 mg L–1) of PdCl2 was prepared
by adding PdCl2 powder (150 mg) into 100 mL of 20 mM HCl
solution, followed by 1 h heat treatment under continuous stirring
until the powder was dissolved completely. After obtaining a completely
uniform solution, the wood slices were immersed in it and heated overnight
at 80 °C to obtain a Pd NPs/wood 3D membrane. It is estimated
that the Pd NP content was 0.19 wt %.

Water Treatment Measurements
The waste removal performance
of the 3D Pd NPs/wood membrane was evaluated using the degradation
of MB in an aqueous solution in the presence of NaBH4 as
the model reaction. Nominally, 300 mL of MB (∼40 mg L–1) and 30 mL of NaBH4 (100 mg L–1) were
mixed with DI water to form an aqueous solution. The 3D Pd NPs/wood
membrane was used as a filter for this MB-contaminated aqueous solution.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy measurements were
conducted before and after filtration by employing a LAMBDA 650 UV–vis
spectrophotometer.4,36 The MB concentration was monitored
with an absorption peak at 664 nm, and the MB degradation efficiency
was calculated as follows 1  where C0 is the initial MB concentration,
and C is the MB concentration after filtration. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM-Quanta FEG-250) was used to study the internal structure
of the 3D wood.

Environmental Analysis
Goal and Scope Definition
The prime objective of this
study was to compare the environmental impact of a wood-based filtration
system operated with different sets of membranes: neat 3D Gb-wood
membrane and Pd/Gb-wood membrane. Life-cycle impact assessment (LCA)
of the designed wood membrane was used for the environmental impact
analysis. Gabi-education 2018 version was utilized to classify these
impacts based on the CML methodology with an endpoint gate-to-grave
approach.

Inventory Analysis
Life-cycle inventory
analysis (LCI)
was conducted regarding mainly wastewater flow and energy consumption
in the input items and treated water as the output item. The wastewater
input, energy consumption, recycling involved in the construction
and operation of the wastewater treatment unit were collected and
categorized. Inventories of the system are shown in Table 2. Most
LCA data related to individual units were taken from the Gabi database.

Impact Assessment
Impact assessment is one of the important
steps in measuring the environmental impacts in LCA. CML was employed
as the life-cycle impact assessment method in this study. The CML
approach was used to indicate the impacts of the activities in a broad
set of environmental issues such as human health, ecosystem, and resources.
