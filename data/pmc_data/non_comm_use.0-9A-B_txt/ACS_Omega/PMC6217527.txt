A high-performance semiconductor
zinc oxide (ZnO) on melamine formaldehyde-coated
cellulose nanocrystals (MFCNCs) was synthesized and evaluated for
its application in smart cosmetics. These ZnO@MFCNC hybrid nanostructures
were evaluated for their in vitro sun protection factor performance
and photocatalytic activity under simulated UV and solar radiation.
The photodegradation kinetics of a model pigment (methylene blue)
was fitted to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. A 4-fold increase
in the photocatalytic activity of ZnO@MFCNCs was observed when compared
to pure ZnO. This is associated with (i) increased specific surface
area provided by the MFCNC template, (ii) confined surface energy
and controlled growth of ZnO nanoparticles, and (iii) entrapment of
photoinduced charge carriers in the pores of the core–shell
MFCNC rod, followed by fast promotion of interfacial e-charge transfer
to the surface of the catalyst. The present study demonstrates how
an increase in photocatalytic activity can be engineered without the
introduction of structural defects or band gap tailoring of the semiconductor.
The aqueous-based ZnO@MFCNC hybrid system displayed attractive UV-absorption
and photocatalytic characteristics, offering the conversion of this
renewable and sustainable technology into intelligent cosmetic formulations.

Introduction
Recent
advances in the epitaxy of semiconductor materials have
made it possible to fabricate metal oxide structures, where the confined
electrons (e–) and holes (h+) could potentially
be used to fine-tune the redox functionalities.1,2 For
solid-state systems, ZnO semiconductors with a wide band gap energy
of 3.37 eV and with inherent UV-absorbing characteristics are promising
materials because of their high quantum efficiency. They have found
applications in optical devices, sensors, transparent electrodes,
solar cells, photocatalysis, antibacterial activity, and cosmetics.3−5 For these principal applications, the structural defects, morphology,
size, surface area, and crystallinity are prime factors that determine
the efficacy of the metal oxide. Research on these systems has focused
on strategies to enhance the properties mainly through the introduction
of oxygen vacancies, structural defects on the surface of the crystal,
and widening the band gap of the metal oxide to limit the fast recombination
of photogenerated charge carriers.4 Doping
with a variety of materials including both metal ions6−8 and metal oxides4,9−11 has shown that
the band gap can be tailored and the range is promising for functional
optoelectronic devices. However, in applications that require formulation
in solution, the use of colloidal ZnO nanocrystals has encountered
various challenges because of their tendency to aggregate through
Ostwald ripening associated with their high surface energy.3 As a result, these nanoparticles (NPs) are unstable
during storage and their surface reactivity is reduced, which hinders
their application in waste water treatment, photocatalysis, personal
care, and biological systems. The possibility of using hybrid nanocomposites
to fabricate functional systems in a simple aqueous solution process
could overcome this issue and allow broader engineering application.
One such hybrid that has the flexibility to meet these demands is
a cellulose-based nanorod derived from wood pulp known as cellulose
nanocrystal (CNC). The biocompatible 150 × 5 nm dimensional crystalline
domains, extracted from wood fiber, are excellent substrates for the
growth of semiconductor ZnO NPs. Large scale production of CNCs has
been demonstrated by CelluForce Inc. in Montreal, Canada. The naturally
uniform nanocrystal offers high specific surface area, long term stability
in water, consistent dimensions, and high mechanical strength.12 A comparison on the preparation methods, size,
morphology, and application of reported CNC–ZnO nanocomposites
is summarized in Table 1.

The present study is
directed toward evaluating the combination
of semiconductor ZnO with a biocompatible CNC template and the advantage
it offers in controlling the size of NP for high performance smart
cosmetic systems. We focus on the design and synthesis of an optimal
and highly porous nanohybrid system for use as a UV filter and a photocatalytic
agent for the degradation of dye pigments or organic pollutants. This
nanostructure was developed using a melamine-formaldehyde (MF)-coated
CNC template that provides a mesoporous and nitrogen-rich substrate
for the chelated growth of ZnO NPs in aqueous solution, without the
need of high temperature calcination, surfactants, or capping agents.
First, the sun protection factor (SPF) of the ZnO@MFCNC was evaluated
through spectrophotometric analysis, and the role of the template
in controlling the size of ZnO NPs to enhance the SPF values was demonstrated.
Second, the photocatalytic degradation of a model pigment (methylene
blue) under UV and solar radiation was evaluated using a pseudo-first
order Langmuir–Hinshelwood model and explained with the solid
band theory. The ZnO@MFCNC hybrid produced a 4-fold increase in photocatalytic
performance through (i) the increased surface area of the MFCNC matrix,
(ii) the confined surface energy and growth of the ZnO NPs, and (iii)
the fast promotion of interfacial charge transfer to the surface of
the catalyst. This last effect is in part due to the mesoporous core–shell
structure of the MFCNC that traps the photoinduced charge carriers
and prevents e–/h+ recombination without
the need for tailoring the band gap or using structural defects on
the surface. A complete analysis and characterization of the system
using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, UV–vis
spectroscopy, and transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) measurements
validated the properties and performance of the ZnO nanohybrid system.

Results
and Discussion
The FTIR spectra shown in Figure 1A offer some insight into the
chemical functionalities
of the nanocomposite, as well as the MFCNC and pure ZnO structure.
Pure ZnO is normally recognized in the infrared (IR) spectrum by the
characteristic Zn–O stretching vibration between 430 and 500
cm–1, and broad peaks in the range of 3800–3900
cm–1 attributed to adsorbed H2O molecules
present on the lattice.8 For comparison,
the IR spectrum for the MFCNC–ZnO (Figure 1A) hybrid shows a distinct absorption at
428 cm–1 (Figure 1A, spectrum b), which confirms the presence of ZnO
in the nanocomposite. Another noticeable peak at 813 cm–1 arises from the 1,3,5-triazine ring of melamine, which confirms
the presence of MFCNC in the hybrid.18 This
FTIR spectrum was compared with that of MFCNC (Figure 1A, spectrum c), which shows the typical peaks
at 814 and 1565 cm–1 arising from the 1,3,5-triazine
ring in the melamine structure, the C–H bending vibration absorption
of the methylene group at 1330 cm–1, and the characteristic
bands at 1020 cm–1 assigned to the −CH2–O–CH2 or −CH2–OH
ether linkage of the MF resin.18 It should
be noted that the ZnO stretching vibration at 430 cm–1 is absent from the pure MFCNC spectrum.

Figure 1 (A) FTIR spectra of ZnO,
ZNO@MFCNC, and MFCNC measured between
4000 and 400 cm–1. (B) TGA measurements of ZnO,
ZnO@MFCNC, and MFCNC obtained at a heating rate of 20 °C/min
under air.

Further support on the mass loading
of active ZnO on the surface
of MFCNCs was determined from TGA. On the basis of the weight loss
profiles of the three TGA curves (illustrated in Figure 1B), the residual contents of
ZnO, ZnO@MFCNC, and MFCNC determined at 700 °C were 96.42, 86.73,
and 9.54%, respectively. From the analysis, the content of ZnO was
calculated to be 88.85%, based on eq 1. 1  where CMFCNC and CZnO are the mass ratios of MFCNC and ZnO, respectively.
The degradation beyond 350 °C for the hybrid and MFCNCs was mainly
attributed to the size and surface area of the MF coated on CNCs.19 No net weight loss was observed in the TGA curve
of pure ZnO, confirming the thermal stability of ZnO.20

In Figure 2A, the
diffraction peak in both the MFCNC and ZnO@MFNCNC spectra observed
at 2θ = 18.5°, and t marked with (*) are from cellulose
1. XRD data confirmed that all of the samples produced (without any
additional calcination) were crystalline and possessed phase transformations
corresponding to bulk ZnO that matched the reported literature values.21−23 The highest intensity peak of the (101) plane observed along with
other smaller intensity peaks at 100, 002, 101, 102, 110, 103, 112,
and 004 were indexed to the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO structure (Crystallography
Open Database, COD 1011258). These diffraction patterns were then
analyzed using the Debye–Scherrer (eq 2) to determine the crystallite size of the
ZnO NP presents in the nanohybrid 2  where Dhkl is the crystallite
size in (nm) perpendicular to the crystal
(hkl) plane, k is a constant equals
to 0.94, λ is the wavelength of the incident X-ray radiation
[Cu Kα (0.154 nm)], β is the integral breadth of the full
width at half maximum (fwhm), (π/180) is the correction factor
to convert β into radians, and θ is the scattering angle
for the (hkl) plane. The size calculated for the
pure ZnO crystal was 39.90 ± (1 nm), whereas the crystallite
size of ZnO in the ZnO@MFCNC hybrid was 15.19 ± (1 nm). The estimated
crystallite sizes of the two samples agree with the XRD patterns shown
in Figure 2A because
the larger crystal size that is linked to pure ZnO, is characteristically
associated with more pronounced sharp intensity peaks, whereas the
smaller and broader peaks that are observed for the ZnO@MFCNC spectrum
are linked to a smaller crystal size.22,23 Additionally,
the presence of these crystal planes and intensity peaks confirmed
the successful formation of ZnO NPs on the surface of MFCNCs.

Figure 2 (A) XRD patterns
of MFCNCs, synthesized ZnO, and the ZnO@MFCNC
nanohybrid. (B) Zeta potential measurements of the three systems in
aqueous solutions as a function of acidic pH.

The stability of the NPs was evaluated from zeta potential
measurements
of the ZnO@MFCNC complex and the metal oxide aqueous suspensions as
a function of pH. This method is ideal for assessing the colloidal
stability of the dispersion through evaluating the surface charge
of the NPs. For the targeted sunscreen application, it is important
to have a dispersion that is stable under acidic conditions at the
natural skin surface (pH of below 5).24 Research studies have indicated that a pH of less than 5 is critical
for maintaining the biophysical parameters and resident skin microflora
on the epidermal surface.24Figure 2B shows a strong pH dependency
of the three systems; MFCNC, ZnO@MFCNC, and ZnO based on the electrophoretic
mobility in well-dispersed Millipore water. The presence of chemical
groups such as ZnOH2+, ZnOH, and ZnO on the
surface of the ZnO NP is highly pH dependent.25 As such, a low positive charge of around +10 mV (between pH 3 and
5) observed for pure ZnO in acidic solution can be attributed to the
partial transfer of protons (H+) from the acidic environment,
leading to an unstable Zn(OH)2+ surface chemical
composition.25 In comparison, it is interesting
to note that the ZnO@MFCNC hybrid yielded a strong positive charge
(+35 mV) in acidic conditions with pH < 4.5 because of the protonation
of amine groups and a triazine ring, revealing a strong (+) charge
from nitrogen (N1) on the melamine structure.26 With a nitrogen-rich polymer backbone covering the surface of CNC,
there is a large positive charge, making the ZnO@MFCNC nanohybrid
electrochemically stable in aqueous solution. Beyond the pKa constant for melamine in water (5.0),26 the zeta potential decreased from +34.1 mV at
pH 4 to +22 mV at pH 5, indicating the practical usage of the nanohybrid
in the acidic condition (pH < 5).

The morphology of the hybrid
system and the form of ZnO NPs were
characterized using TEM. Figure 3A,B show the increase in the diameter and slight darkening
of CNCs when coated with MF as observed previously.19,27 The ZnO@MFCNC hybrid exhibited a unique leaf-like growth of ZnO
on the CNC rods, as shown in the inset of Figure 3C. Although the size of the MFCNCs remained
unchanged, the average diameter of ZnO NPs on the surface of CNCs
was less than 20–25 nm. In contrast, the ZnO particles synthesized
without the MFCNC template displayed micron-sized clusters of particles
(>200 nm), primarily because of the high interface energy of NPs
that
lead to the formation of aggregates in solution.28

growth of ZnO NPs on the surface of MFCNCs; and (D) pure ZnO particles

SPF Measurements
The efficacy of a sunscreen was determined
by a quantitative measurement of the SPF, which is a numerical-rating
system that reflects the degree of protection provided by a sunscreen
product. The SPF is based on the ratio of the least amount of UV energy
(UVB) required to produce minimal erythema on sunscreen-protected
skin over the amount of energy required to produce the same erythema
on unprotected skin.29,30 The solar spectrum is composed
of UVA (320–400 nm) and UVB (290–320 nm) radiation,
where UVA is primarily involved in penetrating the epidermal and dermal
layers of the skin that damage the keratinocytes, which is known to
cause skin cancer.100,200 Although the effects of UVA
sound dramatic, the risk of UVB exposure is approximately 1000×
more erythemogenic compared to UVA, which can cause severe photo damage
and sunburns because of the shorter UVB wavelength.29 As such, the SPF is primarily a measure of protection against
UVB. Here the photoprotection of the hybrid structure and pure ZnO
aqueous solutions were determined based on an in vitro spectroscopic
method to calculate the SPF values using the well-developed Mansur
mathematical expression (eq 3)31 3  where CF is the correction
factor (10), EE(λ)
is the erythemogenic effect and solar radiation intensity at wavelength I(λ), and Abs(λ) is UV spectrophotometric absorbance
values at wavelength λ determined at every 5 nm increments.
The values of EE × I were normalized constants
determined by Sayre et al., 197932 as shown
in Table 2.

Figure 4 shows the
comparative SPF values of the ZnO@MFCNC nanohybrid and pure ZnO prepared
from various hydroxide ratios. The results from the experimental studies
demonstrated that ZnO deposited on the surface of the MFCNC substrate
and the pure ZnO system displayed good SPF values of between 10 and
14 when the ratio of ([MFCNC]/[Zn2+])/[OH] ranged from
1:2 to 1:10. In cases where ZnO@MFCNC displayed a better SPF value
than pure ZnO, it is likely to be related to the better dispersion
stability of the ZnO@MFCNC system. The role of the MFCNC matrix is
obvious from these results as it (i) contributes to an increased surface
area because of the sponge-like porous matrix, (ii) offers the chelation
of zinc ion (Zn2+) with enhanced affinity through the rich
nitrogen groups of the MF resin,33,34 and (iii)
promotes the confined growth of the metal oxide in the mesopores of
the MF resin leading to a controlled NP size that offers better UV
absorption compared to pure micron-size ZnO.

Figure 4 Bar graph illustrating
the comparative SPF values of aqueous ZnO@MFCNCs
and pure ZnO solutions, with increasing [OH] ratios.

By systematically varying the ratio of MFCNC-Zn2+ to
hydroxide, an optimal composition of [Zn2+]/[OH–] of 1:3 was observed. It is suggested that this optimal ratio for
the measurement of SPF is directly related to the particle size and
morphology, where the reduction in the particle size, from micro to
nano, directly affects the SPF. From our observation, it is evident
that for the hydroxide ratio of between 4 and 10, the reaction between
the zinc ion and hydroxide proceeded rapidly, producing larger particles
that were less stable, in contrast to the optimal ratio of 1:3. By
further increasing the hydroxide ratio beyond 10, no ZnO crystal was
produced, which was confirmed by the absence of the characteristic
exciton energy peak of ZnO at 350 nm in the UV region, in addition
to the disappearance of the cloudy aggregates.35 The result demonstrated that the alkaline ratio controlled
the ZnO particle formation after the initial nucleation on the MFCNC
substrate.

UV Absorbance & Optical Properties
The formation
of the ZnO crystal on the surface of MFCNCs was validated by the presence
of the characteristic UV absorption peak at 350 nm for ZnO, in addition
to the peak at 209 nm because of the triazine ring of MF.36 The excited electronic states of semiconductor
ZnO NPs with a direct band gap energy of 3.31 eV differ to a great
degree from that of the bulk ZnO. This change causes a quantum confinement
effect in ZnO NPs.37,38 The widening of the band gap
energy corresponds to a reduction in the NP size and is evidenced
by an overall blue shift in the spectrum.38 From the optical measurements of the ZnO@MFCNC nanohybrid structure,
there was a visible blue shift detected in the wavelength from the
bulk ZnO at 365 nm to the ZnO@MFCNC at 350 nm, as illustrated in the
inset of Figure 5.
The blue shift is a good indication of the relative reduction in the
particle size compared to pure ZnO, and it confirmed the importance
of a chelating template of the porous MFCNC in controlling the NP
formation in aqueous solution.

Photocatalytic Evaluation
under Solar Simulation and UV Radiation
The rate of degradation
of methylene blue (MB), as determined by
colorimetric measurements (Figure 6A,B), was used to assess the photocatalytic performance
of the ZnO@MFCNC nanohybrid. A substantial enhancement over the bulk
ZnO system was found with the ZnO@MFCNC system. The pseudo-first order
linear kinetic rate analysis shown in Figure 6C was fitted to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model (eq 4) 4  where Ct is the concentration at irradiation
time (t), C0 is the initial
concentration at
irradiation time 0, and k is the first-order rate
constant. Linear regressions of the data presented in Figure 6C revealed a 4-fold increase
in the kinetic rate for the ZnO@MFCNC system (0.0117 min–1) compared to ZnO (0.00314 min–1), and an even
faster rate of 0.0387 min–1 was observed for the
study under sunlight of the CNC-supported nanohybrid. The ZnO@MFCNC
system showed a complete degradation under solar stimulation after
60 min, and 96.49% degradation under artificial UV light after 200
min, as illustrated in Figure 6D, whereas bulk ZnO displayed only half the degradation (51.14%)
at 200 min, with complete degradation observed after 6 h. The kinetics
under sunlight for the CNC-supported hybrid system indicated that
the efficiency of dye degradation is better (0.0387 min–1) under sunlight in comparison to UV alone (0.0117 min–1), as shown in Figure 6. We postulate the faster kinetics to be primarily attributed to
sunlight irradiation,39,40 with both UV and visible incorporated
activation of the MFCNC-supported catalyst. The faster kinetics can
be defined by the UV + visible (sunlight intensity) over the 60 min
interval, where first the light activates the surface of the catalyst,
and progressively penetrates the porous MFCNC network and the ZnO
catalyst. The results offer evidence that the hybrid system was activated
by both the UV, as well as the visible region for photocatalytic degradation,
making it advantageous for practical outdoor applications.

These results were primarily
associated with the molecular activity
at the atomic level, followed by series of photocatalytic redox reactions
at the surface of the semiconductor ZnO@MFCNC. The emphasis of the
optical absorption in colloidal semiconductors is interestingly dissimilar
from bulk materials.11,41 The electronic conduction in
a solid could be explained through the molecular orbital (MO) theory,
where the MOs are treated as energy bands instead of discrete levels
because of the small difference in energy.38,41 As in the case of the solid semiconductor ZnO@MFCNC, electrons occupy
the energy bands according to their energy.

Upon UV excitation,
the electrons in the highest occupied orbital
of the valence band (VB) are promoted to the unoccupied orbital of
the conduction band (CB) above it; leaving behind a hole (positive
charge) in the VB.41 The space between
these energy bands is the band gap which acts as a barrier to electronic
mobility. The e–/h+ formation dictates
photocatalysis, where e–/h+ pairs migrate
to the semiconductor surface and participate in a redox reaction with
the adsorbed organic compound which in this case is methylene blue.6,7,9,42 The
migration rate increases when there is a widening of the band gap
which occurs with a reduction in the particle size. The faster rate
allows e– or h+ to react to a greater
degree with surface-adsorbed species rather than recombine; thus,
improving the catalytic efficiency.28,40 Here, the
role of the nanotemplate of the mesoporous MFCNC becomes important,
as it confines the growth of ZnO because of the high specific surface
provided by the MFCNC (212.8 m2 g–1),19 where the surface area for ZnO NPs in the wurtzite
phase is approximately 29.35 m2 g–1.43 This phenomenon has three related consequences,
namely; (1) it controls the NP growth, (2) it increases the specific
surface area of the semiconductor ZnO, and (3) it effectively prevents
e–/h+ recombination and increases the
concentration of the photoinduced charge carriers at the surface of
the catalyst, which has major implications for the photocatalytic
performance of the structure. A schematic illustration of a proposed
mechanism, with explanation of the redox reactions is described in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Proposed mechanism of
degradation and schematic representation
of semiconductor ZnO grown on the surface of MFCNCs.

With UV excitation energy exceeding the band gap,
electrons (e–) are promoted from the ground state
to the CB, resulting
in vacancy (h+) in the VB. The e–/h+ formation dictates the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor
hybrid. The photogenerated h+ oxidizes the H2O molecules adsorbed on the surface of ZnO to OH. radicals.
In the upper band, the excited e– of CB reacts with
pre-adsorbed O2 molecules to form reactive oxygen species
(ROS) (i.e. superoxide anion radical •O2–).44 Given the high
quantum yield of photogenerated holes, actual degradation of the dye
can arise from direct transfer of photogenerated carriers or through
the formation of ROS,42 which complete
the reaction by degrading any organic pollutants in primary contact.
The photocatalytic activity of ZnO in altering the optical properties
of dye pigments can be utilized to design smart cosmetic products,
where the tone color of the cosmetic on skin can be tuned to fade
as a function of exposure to sunlight. In addition, in countries where
air pollution from organic debris is a significant concern, these
photocatalysts can be actively utilized as a method to degrade the
contaminants, making it an important aspect of the proposed system.

Table 3 shows a
comparison of the kinetics for the photocatalytic performance of other
ZnO-based systems reported in the literature for the degradation of
organic pollutants. Our synthesized hybrid material demonstrates comparable
rate constants for irradiation under UV and ameliorated values for
the solar-radiated samples.

Experimental Methods
Materials
CNCs
with dimensions 150 nm in length and
5 nm wide were supplied by Celluforce Inc. Quebec, Canada. All of
the analytical grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used as received.

Synthesis of the ZnO@MFCNC Colloidal Nanohybrid
MF-coated
CNCs (MFCNCs) were prepared via the poly-condensation of MF precursor
on the CNC rod as described previously by Wu et al. 2016.19 The optimal hybrid ratio was obtained by dispersing
143 mg of MFCNC in 15 mL of water. After which, 165 mg of zinc acetate
dihydrate was dissolved in another 15 mL of water and added dropwise
to the MFCNC solution and stirred at 5 °C for 1 h, where the
positive zinc ions were chelated by the nitrogen groups of the MFCNC
rods. Then, 30 mL of 0.0225 molar NaOH was introduced dropwise to
hydrolyze the Zn2+@MFCNC solution, which was stirred at
room temperature for 2 h. The samples were exposed to hydrothermal
treatment at 100 °C for 1 h, and purified through dialysis. The
preparation of pure ZnO followed the same procedure but without the
addition of MFCNC; 165 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn2+) was predissolved in 15 mL of water and reacted with 30 mL of 0.0225
molar NaOH at room temperature for 2 h. This was followed by hydrothermal
treatment and purification. A schematic describing the synthesis procedure
is illustrated in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of
semiconductor ZnO on the surface of MF-coated CNC rods.

SPF Measurements
The absorption
characteristics of
the sunscreen agents were determined based on spectrophotometric analysis
of dilute aqueous suspensions of ZnO@MFCNC and pure ZnO based on 5%
active ingredient. Samples were diluted in water at a final concentration
of 2 μL/mL and analyzed by UV spectrophotometry from 290 to
800 nm at 5 nm intervals using a 1 cm quartz cell according to Mansur’s
method.31 Water was used as a blank sample
for the baseline correction. All of the tested materials were measured
three times to obtain the standard error for the SPF measurements.

Photocatalytic Evaluation
UV: 50 mg
of ZnO@MFCNC powder was mixed with 50 mL of 0.02 mg/mL methylene blue
(MB) solution. The mixture was sonicated and vortexed to prepare a
uniform dispersion of the hybrid powder, which was continuously stirred
in the dark for 1 h to achieve an equilibrium absorption–desorption
state. A Blak-Ray B-100AP-R High Intensity (100 W) 365 nm 2.5 A, 115V-60
Hz Lamp was used for UV irradiation of the samples. The solution was
exposed to high-intensity UV irradiation, and 3 mL aliquots were withdrawn
at 20 min intervals, diluted 10 times, and centrifuged for 10 min
at 7000 rpm. The absorbance was recorded using an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer (Cary Bio 100) measured from 200
to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals. The reaction was continued for 240 min
by which time the dye was completely degraded. A parallel study to
compare the photocatalytic performance of pure ZnO using the same
protocol was conducted for 360 min.

Sunlight: identical reaction conditions were used for the evaluation on the
effect of sunlight on the photocatalytic performance of ZnO@MFCNCs
and pure ZnO, and 3 mL aliquots were withdrawn every 10 min for analysis.
The experiments were conducted in direct sunlight, from 12:00 to 4:00
pm in late July and early August, where the average UV index was 8.
The temperature of the reaction was monitored with a temperature probe,
and the solutions were sealed to minimize the evaporation of the liquid.

and photocatalytic measurements were monitored using an ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) spectrophotometer (Cary Bio 100). TGA was performed
using a TGA Q600 from TA Instruments (New Castle, Delaware). The experiments
were conducted at a heating rate of 20 °C/min in the presence
of air, from 25 to 800 °C. The morphology of the uranyl-stained
CNCs was obtained with a JEM-2100 high resolution transmission electron
microscope. MFCNC, ZnO@MFCNC, and unmodified ZnO particles were characterized
using a Philips CM10 transmission electron microscope. The XRD patterns
of the samples were performed with a Rigaku D/MAX-RB diffractometer
using filtered Cu Kα radiation. FTIR spectra were recorded using
a PerkinElmer 1720 spectrophotometer of freeze-dried samples mixed
with KBr, at a resolution of 4 cm–1, and analyzed
using OPUS software. The zeta potentials of the solutions were measured
as a function of pH from 3.0 to 5.0 every 0.5 units. This range was
tested to check the stability of the system by measuring the surface
charge of the NPs using Zetasizer Malvern Nano ZS90.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that surface-modified porous CNCs in aqueous
solution can be used to control the growth of semiconductor ZnO nanocrystals.
We have evaluated and characterized the surface active ZnO@MFCNC nanohybrid
as an ultraviolet filter and a photocatalytic agent. The material
has high UV absorption with an SPF value of 14 based on 5% active
ingredient. It also provides a 4-fold increase in photocatalysis under
UV and solar radiation. This work shows that the introduction of structural
defects and the tailoring of the band gap are not the only means to
enhance the photocatalytic activity of ZnO. It shows that greater
activity can be engineered through the control of the size, geometry,
and orientation of the semiconductor via the use of a porous template.
The nanohybrid produced has several advantages: it confines the surface
energy and growth of ZnO NPs, and it promotes interfacial e– charge transfer to the surface of the catalyst through entrapment
of the photoinduced charge carriers in the pores of the MFCNC rod
which in turn prevents the e–/h+ recombination.
In summary, by combining the functionality of the N-rich mesoporous
MFCNC with semiconductor ZnO, we have developed a nanostructure that
may find application in the design of smart cosmetic products.
