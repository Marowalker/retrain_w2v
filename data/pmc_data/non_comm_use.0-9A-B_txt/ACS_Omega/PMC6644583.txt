Metal–organic coordination polymers (CPs) have
attracted great research interest because they are easy to prepare,
porous, flexible in composition, and designable in structure. Their
applications in biosensor development, drug delivery, and catalysis
have been explored. Lanthanides and nucleotides can form interesting
CPs, although most previous works have focused on a single type of
metal ligand. In this work, we explored mixed nucleotides and studied
their DNA adsorption properties using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides.
Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) formed
negatively charged CP nanoparticles with most lanthanides, and thus
a salt was required to adsorb negatively charged DNA. DNA adsorption
was faster and reached a higher capacity with lighter lanthanides.
Desorption of pre-adsorbed DNA by inorganic phosphates, urea, proteins,
surfactants, and competing DNA was successively carried out. The results
suggested the importance of the DNA phosphate backbone, although hydrogen
bonding and DNA bases also contributed to adsorption. The AMP CPs
adsorbed DNA more strongly than the GMP ones, and using mixtures of
AMP and GMP, continuous tuning of DNA adsorption affinity was achieved.
Such CPs were also used as a sensor for DNA detection based on the
different affinities of single- and double-stranded DNA, and a detection
limit of 0.9 nM target DNA was achieved. Instead of tuning DNA adsorption
by varying the length and sequence of DNA, the composition of CPs
can also be controlled to achieve this goal.

Introduction
Materials that can adsorb DNA are of great analytical and biomedical
importance for applications such as biosensor development,1−4 delivery
of nucleic acids,5,6 and stimuli-responsive materials.7−9 To date, many types of inorganic
nanomaterials have been tested for this purpose, including metal nanoparticles,10−12 carbon-based nanomaterials,9,13−16 transition metal dichalcogenides,17 and metal oxides.18 They interact with DNA through base chemisorption, π–π
stacking, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces, or by binding
to the phosphate backbone of DNA.19−21 Although DNA adsorption affinity can be tuned by
varying the length and sequence of DNA,22−25 it is more difficult
to tune the interaction by continuously varying the properties of
nanomaterials. From materials design standpoint, it is interesting
and potentially useful to have materials with continuously tunable
affinities for DNA adsorption.

Other intermolecular interactions,
such as DNA base pairing interactions and metal coordination, were
less explored for DNA adsorption. In this regard, nucleotide-coordinated
materials are capable of harnessing such interactions.26,27 Coordination polymer (CP) nanoparticles made of metal ions and organic
ligands may offer an opportunity to design such materials. Nucleotides
are excellent metal ligands, with both nucleobases and phosphate groups
for metal binding. Nishiyabu et al. first reported coordination polymer
(CP) nanoparticles formed from various lanthanide (Ln) ions and purine
nucleotides.28,29 Various applications of such
CPs in loading guest molecules and sensing have been explored.28−31 Under
certain conditions, such materials can also form hydrogels.32 By using other metal ions, such as Zn2+,33 Fe3+,34 Au3+,35−37 and Cu2+,38 coordination materials
forming hydrogels, coating materials, and nanozymes have also been
demonstrated.

Lanthanides (Ln) contain 15 elements and they
can form CPs with various nucleotides.28,39 We have recently
performed a systematic titration of lanthanides to nucleotides and
found a continuous thermodynamic trend.40 We hypothesize that it might be possible to continuously tune the
interaction strength between DNA and lanthanide containing CPs by
varying the lanthanide and/or nucleotides. In this work, we wanted
to achieve two goals: (1) a careful study of DNA adsorption by such
CPs in terms of material composition and interaction forces; and (2)
tuning DNA adsorption affinity. Finally, preliminary analytical applications
of such materials were demonstrated.

Results and Discussion
Nucleotide-Coordinated
Lanthanide Nanoparticles
Our CPs were prepared by mixing
adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or guanosine monophosphate (GMP) with
various lanthanides (Ln3+) (Figure 1A). All samples spontaneously formed particles
as judged from increased turbidity (Figure 1B), and the Tb3+/GMP sample also
showed strong green luminescence, also indicating the coordination
reaction.28 Previous work showed that both
the nucleobase and the phosphate of these nucleotides are required
for forming such CPs,28,40,41 and
a proposed structure of Ln3+/GMP is also shown in Figure 1A.

CP nanoparticles formed from GMP/Tb3+ and GMP/La3+ under normal and UV light. ζ-Potential of the CP nanoparticles

and (C) AMP; or (D) GMP at different ratios (Ln3+/nucleotide

SEM samples were coated with Pt before imaging.

To gain
a comprehensive understanding of these CPs, we first prepared samples
with different ratios between Ln3+(La3+, Eu3+, Gd3+,Tb3+, and Lu3+) and
nucleotides (AMP and GMP). We chose these five Ln3+ ions
to represent the beginning, middle, and end of the series. Because
DNA is a polyanion, electrostatic interaction is likely to be important.
Therefore, we measured the ζ-potential of the products (Figure 1C,D). To have a full
understanding, we also varied the ratio between Ln3+ and
the nucleotides. All of them were negatively charged regardless of
the ratio, except for La3+/GMP showing a charge close to
zero. The negative charges on these materials are attributable to
the phosphate group on the nucleotides. The final product was not
very much affected by the initial ratio of the reactants, suggesting
well-defined and stable complexes were formed. Considering this, a
fixed 1:2 ratio of Ln3+/nucleotide was used for preparing
the CPs for the subsequent experiments.

The morphology of the
Tb3+/AMP and Tb3+/GMP samples was examined by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 1E,F) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Figure 1G,H). They formed
nanoparticle aggregates with individual particles being around 40
nm, which was consistent with the literature report.22 These samples were freshly prepared and used, and we have
recently noticed that for heavy lanthanides mixed with AMP, their
CP nanoparticles would transform into hydrogels after overnight storage.32

DNA Adsorption
by CP Nanoparticles
As Ln3+ ions can strongly
bind DNA, and nucleotides may also base-pair with DNA, we were interested
in studying their DNA adsorption properties. To achieve a systematic
understanding, we varied the sequence of DNA and also the composition
of CPs. FAM-A15 DNA (a 15-mer polyadenine with a carboxyfluorescein
label) was used as an example to illustrate our experiment. We fixed
the concentration of FAM-A15 at 20 nM and monitored its
background fluorescence for 10 min. Each CP material was then added
at various
concentrations (Figure 2A–F). In general, a higher CP concentration induced more fluorescence
quenching, which indicated more DNA adsorption. As the emission of
FAM did not overlap with the absorption spectra of the CPs (they mainly
absorbed in the UV region), the quenching here was attributed to photo-induced
electron transfer instead of energy transfer.

Figure 2 Kinetics of FAM-labeled
A15 (20 nM)
adsorption indicated by fluorescence quenching after adding various
concentrations of (A) La3+/AMP, (B) La3+/GMP,
(C) Tb3+/AMP, (D) Tb3+/GMP, (E) Lu3+/AMP, and (F) Lu3+/GMP. The CPs were added at 10 min as
indicated by the arrowheads. (G) Relative fluorescence quenching as
a function of CP concentration in buffer A (10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2). (H)
Kinetics of FAM-A15 (20 nM) adsorption by Tb3+/GMP (150 μg/mL) in the presence of various salt concentrations
in 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES)
buffer (pH 6.0).

With 25 μg/mL
of La3+/GMP, full DNA desorption was achieved, whereas
more Tb3+/GMP and even more Lu3+/GMP were required
to achieve the same quenching efficiency. A similar trend was also
observed with the AMP-containing CPs. Therefore, with the same nucleotide,
lighter lanthanides were more effective for DNA adsorption. For the
same lanthanide, the AMP samples adsorbed the DNA more slowly than
the GMP ones. For a quantitative understanding, we plotted the relative
fluorescence quenching as a function of CP concentration (Figure 2G). At low CP concentrations,
a linear fluorescence quenching was observed. The slopes of these
curves represent DNA adsorption capacity. The slope of La3+/GMP was ∼2.2-fold higher than that of Tb3+/GMP
and ∼2.4-fold higher than that of Lu3+/GMP. For
AMP, the slope of La3+/AMP was similar to that of Tb3+/AMP and ∼1.9-fold higher than that of Lu3+/AMP. Therefore, the La3+-containing CPs had the highest
DNA adsorption capacity, whereas the Lu3+ ones were the
lowest. When AMP and GMP were compared (using the same metal), GMP
had a higher adsorption capacity. Therefore, among these combinations,
La3+/GMP adsorbed the DNA most efficiently. The reason
might be its lack of surface charge (Figure 1D).

To confirm the importance of electrostatic
repulsion, we then studied the effect of salt concentration using
Tb3+/GMP (Figure 2H). Without salt, no fluorescence quenching was observed,
indicating a lack of DNA adsorption. This can be explained by the
long-ranged charge repulsion between the CP and DNA. With 50 mM NaCl,
fluorescence quenching occurred. Further addition of 100 mM Na+ and 1 mM Mg2+ resulted in even faster quenching.
Our results indicated that a certain amount of salt was required to
overcome the electrostatic repulsion for DNA adsorption.

Stronger DNA Adsorption by AMP CPs
After
confirming DNA adsorption, we further explored the mechanism of adsorption
by inducing DNA desorption. DNA is made of nucleosides and a phosphate
backbone, which are responsible for interacting with various materials.
For example, DNA bases stack and hydrogen bond with graphene oxide,14 and DNA bases coordinate with a gold surface,42 whereas the DNA phosphate backbone is mainly
responsible for its adsorption on metal oxides.19,43

We first successively adsorbed a FAM-labeled DNA on Tb3+/AMP and Tb3+/GMP and then washed away the free DNA. To
test whether the phosphate backbone of DNA was involved in adsorption,
we challenged the samples with 10 mM free inorganic phosphate ions
(Figure 3A). An immediate
increase in fluorescence was observed in both samples, indicating
a quick release of the DNA. The system reached a new equilibrium in
a few seconds, after which the signal became stable again. Therefore,
the phosphate backbone of DNA was important for its adsorption onto
both CPs. This is understandable because the phosphate backbone of
DNA can interact with Ln3+.27,40 We calculated
the percentage of released DNA, and the Tb3+/GMP sample
released around 4-fold more DNA than Tb3+/AMP, suggesting
that the DNA adsorption affinity on Tb3+/AMP was higher.

Figure 3 Kinetics
of FAM-A15 DNA desorption from Tb3+/GMP and
Tb3+/AMP CP nanoparticles after adding (A) 10 mM phosphate,
(B) 4 M urea, (C) 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), (D) 1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS), (E) 1% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and (F)
1% Tween 80 in buffer A. The competing compounds were added at 10
min as indicated by the arrowheads.

Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in DNA adsorption by materials
such as graphene oxide.14,20 Urea can break hydrogen
bonds, and it has been commonly used to probe such interactions. Following
this, we exposed our CP nanoparticles with adsorbed DNA to 4 M urea
(Figure 3B). Interestingly,
over 60% of the DNA was released from Tb3+/GMP, whereas
Tb3+/AMP barely released any. Therefore, hydrogen bonding
is also an important force for DNA adsorption by Tb3+/GMP.
It is unclear whether hydrogen bonding is important for Tb3+/AMP. If not, another type of even stronger interaction must exist,
such as Tb3+ binding with the DNA phosphate backbone, as
indicated by the above phosphate washing experiment.

To further
understand DNA adsorption, we then examined DNA displacement by proteins
and surfactants, which may also compete with DNA for surface adsorption
sites. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) had no effect on Tb3+/AMP, whereas ∼30% DNA desorbed from Tb3+/GMP (Figure 3C). Similarly, SDS,
a small molecule anionic surfactant, had no effect on Tb3+/AMP, whereas ∼20% DNA desorbed from Tb3+/GMP (Figure 3D). For cationic
CTAB (Figure 3E) and
a higher molecular weight surfactant, Tween 80 (Figure 3F), Tb3+/AMP also released less
DNA. Therefore, under all of these washing conditions, the DNA was
adsorbed more tightly on the Tb3+/AMP sample.

DNA-Induced DNA Desorption
After understanding
DNA desorption by various denaturing and competing agents, we then
studied DNA-induced DNA desorption, which might be useful for DNA
detection. We first adsorbed FAM-A15 or FAM-T15 on Tb3+/AMP or Tb3+/GMP. Then, the four types
of nonlabeled 15-mer homo-DNAs were sequentially added to hybridize
with or to displace the adsorbed DNA probes as shown in Figure 4A. A few interesting observations
were made. First, no DNA desorbed from Tb3+/AMP, regardless
of the DNA added (Figure 4B,C). On the other hand, when the probe was adsorbed on Tb3+/GMP, it can be desorbed by other DNA sequences, further
confirming the much stronger DNA adsorption affinity of the AMP CPs
(Figure 4D,E).

Figure 4 (A) Adsorption of a FAM-labeled
DNA resulting in quenched
fluorescence, and its subsequent desorption by hybridization to complementary
DNA (cDNA) or displacement by a non-cDNA with recovered fluorescence.
Kinetics of desorption of FAM-labeled A15 (20 nM) from
(B) Tb3+/AMP and (D) Tb3+/GMP, and FAM-labeled
T15 (20 nM) from (C) Tb3+/AMP and (E) Tb3+/GMP by the four 15-mer nonlabeled homo-DNA (0.4 μM
each) added at 10 min. Kinetics of desorption of (F) FAM-labeled A15 (20 nM) and (G) FAM-labeled T15 (20 nM) from
Tb3+/GMP by poly-C DNA of different lengths (0.4 μM
each) added at 10 min.

For Tb3+/GMP, adding C15 induced the highest
adsorption for both probes (Figure 4D,E), whereas T15 and A15 ranked
the next. We have recently observed that poly-C DNA adsorbed on many
nanomaterials (e.g., graphene oxide, MoS2, and various
metal oxides) more tightly than other homo-DNA sequences.19,22,44 At the same time, C can base-pair
with G, which may also contribute to its stronger affinity on Tb3+/GMP. At this moment, it is unclear which mechanism played
a more important role.

In general, FAM-T15 was adsorbed
more tightly on Tb3+/GMP than FAM-A15, as its
signal was much lower. This suggests that in addition to DNA phosphate
interactions, DNA bases may also contribute. For example, G/T can
form a wobble base pair. At the same time, T15 induced
more FAM-A15 desorption than A15 (Figure 4D), and A15 induced
more FAM-T15 desorption than T15 (Figure 4E). This suggests that DNA
hybridization also played a role in DNA desorption.

The effect
of DNA length was then studied using poly-C DNA (Figure 4F,G). C15 and C30 induced the highest desorption, followed by C10, whereas no desorption was observed with C5. Note that
the amount of DNA desorbed by C30 remained the same as
that by C15. Considering that C30 has double
the number of nucleotides (at the same DNA molar concentration) compared
to C15, it is likely that C15 was already in
a favorable configuration for DNA adsorbing on Tb3+/GMP,
and even longer poly-C DNA could not further improve the affinity.

Fine Tuning Affinity by Mixing AMP/GMP
It seemed that changing from GMP to AMP had a huge influence on
the DNA adsorption affinity of the CPs. We suspected that we might
be able to fine-tune the interactions by mixing AMP and GMP at different
ratios. To test this idea, we prepared a series of CPs by using GMP/AMP
mixtures. We adsorbed FAM-A15 on these CPs, and nonlabeled
C15 or T15 was added to desorb the FAM-A15 DNA (Figure 5A,B). In both cases, the more the GMP added, the more the DNA desorbed,
and a roughly linear relationship was observed (Figure 5C). This confirmed that we could indeed tune
DNA adsorption affinity by using their mixtures.

nM) from
Tb3+/(GMP + AMP) by 0.4 μM (A) C15 and
(B) T15 added at 10 min. (C) The percentage of FAM-A15 desorbed from Tb3+/(GMP + AMP) at various GMP
fractions after adding T15 or C15 for 120 min.

DNA Sensing
After the aforementioned fundamental
studies, we then tested these CP nanoparticles as a sensing platform
for DNA detection. As pre-adsorption of probe DNA did not seem to
offer sufficient selectivity (e.g., all DNA sequences can induce probe
desorption), we used the pre-hybridization strategy as shown in Figure 6A.45−47 Here, the probe was a FAM-labeled 24-mer
DNA with a random sequence. We first successively hybridized various
concentrations of the target complementary DNA (cDNA) with the probe
for 10 min, to which Tb3+/AMP or Tb3+/GMP was
added. The kinetics of signaling on Tb3+/GMP (Figure 6B) and Tb3+/AMP (Figure S1A) were followed. The final
fluorescence was higher with a higher concentration of the target
DNA, suggesting that adsorption of duplex DNA was less favorable.
The kinetics of adsorption was quite fast and the system reached a
stable signal in just a few minutes. This cDNA concentration-dependent
fluorescence indicates potential sensing applications.

FAM-24-mer (20 nM) adsorption by Tb3+/GMP in the presence
of various concentrations of the target cDNA.

We quantified
the relative fluorescence enhancement at 10 min after adding the Tb3+/GMP CPs (Figure 6D), and a linear relationship was observed up to 30 nM DNA.
We also measured the detection limits of these sensors based on the
3σ/slope calculation (σ = background variation in the
absence of cDNA) to be 0.9 nM DNA for Tb3+/GMP. This is
comparable to most nanomaterial based DNA sensors.13,48−50

The selectivity
was further tested (Figure 6C), where 100 nM nonlabeled 24-mer DNA did not inhibit probe
adsorption and the fluorescence still dropped, suggesting that DNA
hybridization forming a duplex was required for the inhibited probe
adsorption. We also tested the same sensing method with Tb3+/AMP (Figure S1B,C). As it has stronger
DNA adsorption affinity, the difference between single-stranded and
double-stranded DNA was smaller, and the sensitivity was lower. Finally,
we also tested the Tb3+/GMP based assay in a lake water
sample (Figure S1D), also confirming its
selective recognition of the target DNA.

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied DNA
adsorption and desorption from various Ln3+/nucleotide
CP nanoparticles using AMP and GMP as metal ligands. We discovered
that DNA was adsorbed more tightly by Ln3+/AMP. The phosphate
backbone binding was very important for DNA adsorption onto these
CPs, although DNA bases also contributed to adsorption. Urea, proteins,
and surfactants were more effective in displacing DNA from Tb3+/GMP than from Tb3+/AMP. By mixing AMP and GMP
at various ratios, we continuously tuned the affinity of DNA adsorption.
Using FAM-A15 as a pre-adsorbed probe, C15 induced
more probe desorption than T15 from Tb3+/GMP,
suggesting that C15 adsorption by Tb3+/GMP might
be more favorable than its hybridization between T15 and
A15. Tb3+/GMP exhibited higher probe DNA detection
sensitivity. Considering the modular nature of such CP materials,
it is likely that one could also mix other components including metal
ions and different lengths of phosphate (e.g., AMP and ATP) to further
fine-tune material properties. These fundamental understandings are
valuable for the designing and optimization of materials and devices
based on these CP nanoparticles.

salt hydrate (GMP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).
2-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) was
from Mandel Scientific Inc. (Guelph, ON, Canada). 2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) monohydrate was from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Milli-Q water was used
for all of the experiments.

Preparation
of Nucleotide/Lanthanide CPs
The CPs made of Ln3+/AMP and Ln3+/GMP were synthesized according to a previously
reported method.28 Typically, 1 mL of LnCl3 aqueous solution (5 mM) was added to 1 mL of AMP or GMP disodium
salt solution (10 mM) dissolved in HEPES buffer (100 mM, pH 7.6) under
stirring, and white precipitates were formed immediately. After stirring
for 2 h at room temperature, the CP products were collected by centrifugation
at 14 000 rpm for 10 min followed by washing three times with
water and centrifugation. Finally, the CPs were dispersed in 1 mL
of water and stored at 4 °C for use. Tb3+/(AMP + GMP)
CPs with different ratios of AMP/GMP were prepared using the same
method.

TEM, SEM, and Dynamic Light
Scattering (DLS)
TEM was performed on a Philips CM10 microscope.
An aqueous droplet containing 100 μg/mL of Tb3+/AMP
or Tb3+/GMP dispersion was placed on a 230 mesh holey carbon
copper grid. After 30 s, the excess solution was removed by a piece
of filter paper. SEM was performed on a JSM-6330F (acceleration voltage,
15 kV). After drying the CP deposited filter membranes in vacuum,
they were coated with Pt using a Hitachi E-1030 ion sputter before
imaging. The ζ-potential of the CP nanoparticles was measured
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90
system with a He–Ne laser (633 nm) at 90° collecting optics
at 25 °C. In a typical experiment, CPs were dispersed in 10 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.6).

DNA Adsorption
The kinetics of DNA adsorption were investigated by adding different
concentrations of Ln3+/AMP or Ln3+/GMP with
a molar ratio of 2:1 to 100 μL of solution containing 20 nM
FAM-labeled DNA in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, and
1 mM MgCl2) at 25 °C. Different salt concentrations
were also tested. The fluorescence was measured using a microplate
reader (Infinite F200 Pro, Tecan) with 490 nm excitation and 520 nm
emission. To test DNA desorption, a 500 μL solution containing
Ln3+/AMP or Ln3+/GMP (2 mg/mL) was respectively
incubated with 200 nM FAM-A15 or FAM-T15 in
buffer A in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. Then these solutions
were washed with buffer A by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for
10 min and they were finally dispersed in 500 μL of buffer A
and stored at 4 °C (called sensor solution).

DNA Desorption
To study DNA desorption,
10 μL aliquots of the above sensor solutions were separately
centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The pellets were then
dispersed in 100 μL of 4 M urea, or 10 mM phosphate, and the
fluorescence intensity was measured. To study DNA desorption induced
by proteins and surfactants, each well contained 10 μL of the
above sensor solution and 90 μL of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH
7.6, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2). Then different concentrations
of BSA or surfactant (SDS, Tween 80, and CTAB) were added to induce
desorption. To displace the adsorbed DNA by DNA, 10 μL of the
above DNA sensor solutions was added to each well containing 90 μL
of buffer A. Then a final concentration of 0.4 μM nonlabeled
DNA homopolymers (A15/T15/C15/G15) was added. To study the effect of DNA length, a final concentration
of 0.4 μM C5, C10, C15, and
C30 was added using the same method.

DNA Sensing
In a typical DNA assay, 50
μL of the fluorescent probe FAM-24-mer DNA (20 nM) was hybridized
with different concentrations of target c-24-mer DNA in buffer A for
10 min, to which 2 μL of Tb3+/AMP or Tb3+/GMP (150 μg/mL) dispersion was added. The kinetics of fluorescence
change was then measured using the microplate reader.
