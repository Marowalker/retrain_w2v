Molecular conformation plays an important
role in tuning the packing
modes of organic optoelectronic materials to achieve enhanced and/or
balanced charge transport. Here, we introduce the noncovalent intramolecular
interactions to the host materials of phosphorescent organic light-emitting
diodes (PhOLEDs). Different numbers and/or positions of intramolecular
CH···N noncovalent interactions were constructed by
using different N-heterocycles of pyridine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine
as acceptor units and carbazole as the donor unit in a donor-acceptor-donor
(D-A-D) motif. Thus, designed D-A-D molecules were synthesized facilely
through a one-step Ullmann reaction in high yields, showing varied
intramolecular interactions to regulate the molecular conformation
significantly. Impressively, owing to the quasi-parallel molecular
conformation, which is beneficial for forming facile transporting
channels of both holes and electrons, the newly designed host material
of 9,9′-(pyridine-2,5-diyl)bis(9H-carbazole)
exhibits good device performance of blue PhOLEDs with current, power,
and external quantum efficiencies up to 33.0 cd A–1, 32.1 lm W–1, and 16.3%, respectively. This work
highlights the significant importance of the noncovalent interactions
in designing advanced organic semiconductors for high-performance
optoelectronic devices.

1 Introduction
Phosphorescent
organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs), which can
approach a 100% internal quantum efficiency through harvesting both
singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence, have attracted
considerable attentions in the academic research and commercial industry
owing to their fundamental scientific importance and wide application
potentials especially in the flat-panel display and solid-state lighting.1−6 However, the phosphorescent heavy-metal complexes with long-lived
triplet excited states always suffer from serious triplet excitons
induced quenching effects, such as triplet–polaron quenching,
triplet–triplet annihilation, and singlet–triplet annihilation.7 Therefore, host–guest systems are widely
used to disperse the emissive phosphors to suppress these quenching
effects.8−12 Several essential demands of the host materials should be considered
for the development of high-performance PhOLEDs. First, the host materials
should have a higher triplet energy (ET) level than that of emissive phosphors to allow for efficient forward
energy transfer from the host to dopant and guarantee triplet excitons
in the emissive layer (EML). Second, the frontier molecular orbital
(FMO) energy levels of host materials should well match with their
neighboring active layers for enhancing the carrier injections and
decreasing the driving voltages. Third, the hosts should have excellent
and balanced hole and electron transportation properties to broaden
the recombination area in the EML.1,13

To meet
these requirements simultaneously, bipolar molecules capable
of both efficient hole and electron transports are currently drawn
tremendous attentions among various host materials for high-performance
PhOLEDs.14,15 The incorporation of donor (D) and acceptor
(A) unit into a molecular skeleton through various linkages has been
proved to be one of the most successful strategies to design bipolar
host materials. Nevertheless, the host molecules in D-A structures
not always exhibit efficient and balanced bipolar carrier flux ability,
mainly due to their inferior molecular packing modes in the aggregated
film states.1 Recently, several groups
have demonstrated that the molecular conformation and intermolecular
interactions can be rationally modulated through the utilization of
conformation locking via intramolecular noncovalent interactions (NCIs),
such as H···N, O···S, F···S,
N···S, and so on; thus, effectively tuned the packing
mode in film states by NCIs leads to significant enhancement of the
electrical performance of organic semiconductors.16−19

Here, we introduce NCIs
into the host materials of blue PhOLEDs
in D-A-D molecular architectures to explore the effect of the NCIs
on the electrical performance of organic semiconductors. Carbazole
with sufficiently high triplet energy and good hole-transporting ability
was selected as the donor unit,20 and the
strong electron-deficient nitrogen six-membered heterocyclic rings
of pyridine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine were used as the accepters to
construct three new D-A-D host molecules with noncovalent intramolecular
CH···N interactions.19,21−23 These host molecules with high ET were
facilely prepared through a one-step C–N coupling reaction
in high yields.23 Combined computational
and experimental investigations showed that the intramolecular CH···N
interactions can successfully tune the molecular conformation and
modulate their corresponding packing modes in solid states. Importantly,
with the aid of NCIs, excellent charge transportation properties were
achieved successfully and when used as host materials of blue PhOLEDs
based on bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N](picolinato)iridium(III)
(FIrpic), high device performance with maximum external quantum efficiencies
(EQEs) up to 16.3%, current efficiencies (CEs) of 33.0 cd A–1, and power efficiencies (PEs) of 32.1 lm W–1 were
observed. These findings in purposefully modulating the molecular
packing mode of host materials via intramolecular NCIs provide an
effective strategy for the noncovalent molecular design and development
of high-performance organic semiconductors.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Design, Synthesis, and
Thermal Stability
To take advantage of NCIs for the controlling
of molecular conformation
of host materials, three molecules composed of different CH···N
interactions, namely, 9,9′-(pyridine-2,5-diyl)bis(9H-carbazole) (PyDCz), 9,9′-(pyrimidine-2,5-diyl)bis(9H-carbazole) (PymDCz), and 2,5-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)pyrazine (PyaDCz), were designed
in a directly linked D-A-D structure and readily synthesized through
a one-step C–N coupling of a series of electron-deficient nitrogen
heterocyclic rings and carbazole using a classic Ullmann reaction
in high yields up to 92% (Figure 1a).22 These compounds were
fully characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and elemental analyses (Figures S1–S6, Supporting Information).

Figure 1 (a) Synthetic
procedure of D-A-D host molecules with noncovalent
CH···N interactions. Conditions: (i) potassium carbonate
(K2CO3), copper powder, nitrobenzene, 2,5-dibromopyridine,
2,5-dibromopyrimidine, or 2,5-dibromopyrazine, 180 °C, 48 h.
(b) Single crystal structures of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz.

The molecular conformation and intra/intermolecular interactions
of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz were further investigated by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis (Figure 1b and Figure S7). With the increase of
the number of noncovalent CH···N interactions, these
D-A-D molecules exhibit enhanced intramolecular interactions with
a distance of 2.700 Å for PyDCz, 2.625 Å for PyaDCz, and 2.400 Å for PymDCz and significantly
decreased torsion angle (α) between carbazole and nitrogen heterocyclic
ring with an angle of 46.6° for PyDCz, 43.2°
for PyaDCz, and 26.0° for PymDCz. However,
the remarkably increased torsion angle (β) is observed in PymDCz, which should be attributed to its stronger H–H
repulsion compared to that of PyDCz and PyaDCz as revealed by the reduced density gradient (RDG) (Figure S8). These results indicate that NCIs can successfully
regulate the molecular conformation at the single-molecule state.
The detailed packing modes of these host molecules are also illustrated
in Figure S7. Compared to PymDCz with a large difference torsion angle between α and β,
the crystals of PyDCz and PyaDCz show more
tightly and orderly packing mode, which may be due to their quasi-parallel
arrangement of carbazole endowed by conformation locking through noncovalent
CH···N interactions, thus leading to the greatly improved
intermolecular charge transportation. (Figure S7).

Thermal properties of these D-A-D molecules were
measured by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Figure S9). These molecules exhibit excellent
thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures (Td), corresponding to 5% weight loss of 320, 331, and 328
°C for PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz, respectively. The melting point (Tm) of PyDCz and PymDCz is as high as 229
and 258 °C (Table 1), respectively. These results indicate that the thermal properties
are enhanced by the introduction of additional nonbonding CH···N
interactions, suggesting their promising potential in the thermally
evaporated device fabrications.21

2.2 Optical Properties
The UV–vis
absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of these D-A-D molecules
with noncovalent CH···N interactions were studied in
both dichloromethane (DCM) solution and aggregated film states (Figure 2). The absorption
spectra of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz are quite similar in both solution and film states, revealing two
strong absorption band peaked at ∼290 and ∼340 nm, which
could be ascribed to the π–π* and n−π*
transitions of carbazole moiety, respectively.24,25 For the PL spectra, PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz show broad and structureless emission peaks (λmax) at 382, 431, and 445 nm in DCM solution, respectively,
indicating their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) emission features
due to the CT from the electron donating carbazole unit to highly
electron-deficient nitrogen heterocyclic ring.26 The characteristics of ICT emissions were further verified
by the emission profiles in the different solvents with variated polarities.
With increasing solvent polarities from hexane to methanol, the significantly
red-shifted luminescent peaks in the PL spectra of these three compounds
are observed (Figure S10), testifying again
the typical ICT emissions of these compounds in solution.26,27 In film states, PyDCz and PyaDCz show
slightly red-shifted emission compared to their emission profile in
the solution, with a λmax at around 393 and 465 nm,
respectively. However, PymDCz exhibits a blue-shifted
emission with a λmax at 421 nm, which may be due
to its slightly reduced ICT emission that caused by the twist molecular
conformation in the film state (Figure S7). Notably, these PL spectra demonstrate additional emission peaks
in the range of 550–650 nm, which may be originated from the
intermolecular aggregation and π–π stacking.28 The optical band gap (optEg) of these molecules was estimated from the
film absorption edge.29 The calculated optEgs of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz were 3.40, 3.18, and 2.87
eV, respectively. The phosphorescence spectra of these molecules were
measured in methyltetrahydrofuran (Me-THF) solution at 77 K with a
5 ms delay time (Figure S11).30 The triplet energy levels (ETs) of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PymDCz were identified to be 3.03, 2.98, and 2.66 eV according
to their highest energy vibronic peaks at ∼410, ∼416,
and 466 nm, respectively. The lower ET of PyaDCz may be attributed to its relatively stronger
intermolecular donor–acceptor interactions. To our delight,
the ETs of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz are higher than that of commonly used blue
phosphors of FIrpic, which can support exothermic energy transfer
from the host to FIrpic.11 All of the optical
properties data are summarized in Table 1.

state (solid and open
symbols are for absorption and PL spectra, respectively).

2.3 Electrochemical and Theoretical
Investigations
The electrical properties of these D-A-D molecules
were investigated
by both experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations.28 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz were determined
to be −5.71, −5.82, and −5.73 eV according to
their onset oxidation potentials at 0.95, 1.06, and 0.97 V (Figure S12), respectively. The lowest occupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated on the basis
of optEgs and HOMOs.13 The experimental values are listed in Table 1. The theoretical
calculations demonstrate that their HOMOs are distributed through
the whole molecular skeleton for these three compounds, endowing them
with very similar HOMO energy levels either for theoretical or experimental
values (Figure 3).31 The LUMOs are mainly dispersed on the pyridine
for PyDCz, pyrimidine for PymDCz, and pyrazine
for PyaDCz; therefore, the lowest LUMO energy level of PyaDCz may be due to its stronger electron deficient ability
of pyrazine than that of pyridine and pyrimidine.32,33 The spin density distribution (SDD) was also calculated to further
understand the properties of triplet excited state; the delocalized
triplet excited state with a high ET would
be helpful for the energy transfer from the host to the guest. The
natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis of three molecules was performed
(Figure S13) to reveal the feature of their
excited state. These three molecules exhibited quite similar hybrid
localized and charge transfer state, demonstrating that the triplet
energy should be mainly dominated by the whole molecule. Thus, the
lowest ET of PyaDCz may be
attributed to the lowest triplet energy level of its acceptor unit
of pyrazine.

2.4 Electroluminescence
Performance of Blue PhOLEDs
In light of the high thermal
stability, acceptable ET, and suitable
FMO energy levels of these D-A-D molecules
of PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz, the thermally evaporated blue PhOLEDs with the conventional structure
of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS,
30 nm)/1,1-bis(di-4-tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane (TAPC, 20 nm)/1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (mCP, 8 nm)/10 wt % FIrpic:host (PyDCz, PymDCz, or PyaDCz, 20 nm)/1,3,5-tri(m-pyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene (TmPyPB,
35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) were prepared to evaluate their host
properties (see in Figure 4a).10 In these devices, PEDOT:PSS
and LiF were used as the hole- and electron-injection layers, respectively.
FIrpic was served as the blue emissive phosphorescent dopant, TAPC
and TmPyPB acted as the hole- and electron-transporting layers, respectively.

on PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz (solid symbols represent the electron-only device, while open symbols
are for the hole-only device).

Efficient forward energy transfer from the host to FIrpic
was observed
in the blue PhOLEDs hosted by PyDCz and PymDCz, which can be well verified by their pure electroluminescence (EL)
spectra of FIrpic (Figure 4b). However, the EL spectra of PyaDCz endowed
blue PhOLED not only exhibited a FIrpic emission with a band peaked
at 476 and 499 nm, respectively, but also showed a small shoulder
emission band at around 450 nm. In order to figure out the emission
band, the PL spectra of the composite films with 10 wt % doped FIrpic
were investigated. As shown in Figure S14a, the PL spectra of PyDCz and PymDCz hosted
films revealed the only emission bands of FIrpic without apparent
luminescent peaks of the host materials, which are in good agreement
with the EL spectra of FIrpic doped emitting layer; as similar as
the EL spectra of PhOLED hosted by PyaDCz, the PL emission
of the composite film also demonstrated an additional emission inherited
from the PL emission of PyaDCz film (Figure S14a). Notably, with the increasing of doping concentrations
of FIrpic, the emission peak from PyaDCz gradually became
weaker, reflecting the enhanced energy transfer between from PyaDCz to FIrpic at higher doping concentrations. (Figure S14b).34 The
appearance of host emission reveals that there is a reverse energy
transfer from FIrpic to PyaDCz due to its relatively
low ET of 2.66 eV.

The blue PhOLEDs
hosted by the D-A-D molecules obtained high device
performance with turn-on voltages (Von) of 3.2, 3.9, and 3.7 V, current efficiencies (CE) of 33.0, 23.7,
and 14.6 cd A–1, power efficiencies (PE) of 32.1,
17.3, and 11.7 lm W–1, and EQEs of 16.3, 11.3, and
6.5% for PyDCz, PymDCz, and PyaDCz, respectively (Figure 4b,c). The device based on PyaDCz showed the lowest performance,
which should attribute to its inefficient exothermic energy transfer.
Notably, PyDCz hosted blue PhOLEDs exhibited a higher
device performance than that of PymDCz, although they
have quite similar frontier orbital energy levels and ETs. To understand the exact reasons of the good performance
of PyDCz-based devices, the single-carrier transporting
devices of these three molecules were evaluated through a space charge
limited currents (SCLC) model (Figure 4d).15 The hole- and electron-only
devices were fabricated using the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (35 nm)/host
(100 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al and ITO/LiF (1 nm)/host (100 nm)/LiF
(1 nm)/Al, respectively. The carrier transportation ability of these
molecules is in the order of PymCz < PyaDCz < PyDCz, which should be the main reason for the
highest PhOLEDs performance endowed by PyDCz. It should
be also noted that although PyDCz showed the largest
electron injection barrier owing to its highest LUMO energy level
among these three hosts, PyDCz-based electron-only devices
obtained the highest electron currents. The highest and most balanced
hole and electron transporting ability of PyDCz would
be ascribed to the combined results of its good molecular packing
mode with multiple hole and electron transporting channels at aggregated
states facilitated by the noncovalent CH···N interactions
and small hole and electron reorganization energies (Table S2).35

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized
three D-A-D hosts
with apparent NCIs to tune their molecular conformation and packing
models for high-performance blue PhOLEDs. By changing the number and/or
position of intramolecular CH···N NCIs, carbazole groups
in PyDCz exhibit quasi-parallel arrangement for a close
packing mode in their aggregated states. As indicated by the single-carrier
devices and computational simulations, the well stacked D-A-D host
of PyDCz possesses the facile transport channels of hole
and electron simultaneously. Consequently, by using PyDCz as the host, the high-efficiency blue PhOLED based on FIrpic was
successfully fabricated, showing a maximum CE of 33.0 cd A–1, a PE of 32.1 lm W–1, and an EQE of 16.3%. These
results are comparable to the efficient blue PhOLEDs based on other
types of bipolar hosts. Given the ease of synthesis and improved electrical
performance through utilization of NCIs, this study provides an efficient
design map for the construction of bipolar host materials capable
of finely modulated molecular packing mode, opening up a new avenue
for the design of high-performance organic semiconductor for advanced
optoelectronic applications.
