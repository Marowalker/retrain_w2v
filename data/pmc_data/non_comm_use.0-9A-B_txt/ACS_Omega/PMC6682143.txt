Hybrid tracers containing both fluorescent
and radioactive imaging
labels have demonstrated clinical potential during sentinel lymph
node procedures. To combine these two labels on a single targeting
vector that allows tumor-targeted imaging, end-labeling strategies
are often applied. For αvβ3-integrin-targeting hybrid tracers, providing an excellent model
for evaluating tracer development strategies, end-labeling-based synthesis
provides a rather cumbersome synthesis strategy. Hence, the aim of
this study was to investigate the use of heterobifunctional cyanine
dyes in a click-chemistry-based synthesis strategy for RGD-based hybrid
tracers. The triazole-based hybrid tracers DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] were obtained in fewer steps than DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] and had partition
coefficients of log P(o/w) = −2.55
± 0.10, −1.45 ± 0.03, and −2.67 ± 0.12,
respectively. Both tracers were chemically stable, and the brightnesses
of DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] were, respectively, 23 × 103 and 40 × 103 M–1 cm–1; lower than that of the reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (50 × 103 M–1 cm–1). Assessment of serum protein binding revealed no statistically significant
difference (44 ± 2 and 40 ± 2% bound for DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], respectively; 36 ± 5% bound for DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK]; p > 0.05). DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (KD = 17.5 ± 6.0) had a statistically significantly
higher affinity than the reference compound DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (KD = 30.3 ± 5.7; p <
0.0001), but DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] had
a statistically significantly lower affinity (KD = 76.5 ± 18.3 nM; p < 0.0001).
Both [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] enabled in vivo
visualization of the 4T1 tumor via fluorescence and single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Biodistribution data
(% ID/g) revealed a significant increase in nonspecific uptake in
the kidney, liver, and muscle for both [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]. As a result of the higher background activity, the tumor-to-background
ratio of the click-labeled RGD analogues was twofold lower compared
to the end-labeled reference compound. The use of click chemistry labeling
did not yield a pronounced negative effect on serum protein binding,
in vitro stability, and receptor affinity; and tumors could still
be visualized using SPECT and fluorescence imaging. However, quantitative
in vivo biodistribution data suggest that the triazole and strained
cyclooctyne moieties associated with this type of click chemistry
negatively influence the pharmacokinetics of RGD peptides. Nevertheless,
the design might still hold promise for other targets/targeting moieties.

==== Body
Introduction
Fluorescence
has a broad application as a modality for in vitro
and in vivo imaging.1,2 In the clinical field, an increasing
interest in fluorescence imaging has been triggered by the introduction
of fluorescence camera systems that can be applied during surgery.3−5 In this context, real-time fluorescence imaging is utilized to visualize
a distinct (e.g., diseased) tissue type within the surgical field.
The value of fluorescence for surgical guidance is limited by signal
attenuation, and therefore the technique only provides accurate guidance
in superficial applications (<1 cm) and does not allow for preoperative
imaging.6,7 On the other hand, γ rays produced
by isotopes such as 99mTc and 111In are
not held back by this characteristic and can penetrate human tissue
without limitations, which makes them suited for noninvasive (preoperative)
imaging.8

To combine these features,
tracers that contain both a fluorescent
and radioactive imaging label can be designed. In these so-called
“dual-labeled”, “bimodal”, or rather “hybrid”
tracers, the fluorescent and radioactive signatures complement each
other, creating a “best-of-both-worlds” scenario in
clinical image-guided surgery applications.8−10 Today, hybrid
tracers containing cyanine dyes (Scheme 1A, left) are constructed by conjugating branched
linkers (in white) bearing both the radioactive label (in red; mostly
a chelate) and the fluorescent dye (in blue) to the targeting vector
(in green), i.e., containing end-conjugated dyes as introduced by
Josephson et al.11,12 In practice, however, such end-conjugated
cyanine-dye-based hybrid tracers make use of redundant spacers and
suffer from a low synthetic yield due to the larger number of synthetic
steps with concomitantly low yields.

a Cy5 Dye as Spacer between Chelate and Targeting Moiety Using Click
Chemistry)
As an alternative
to end-labeling strategies, we hypothesized that
it may be possible to improve the ease of synthesis by using click
chemistry, which has been on the rise ever since the investigation
of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition by Huisgen in the 1960s. After about
four decades, Sharpless and Meldal independently discovered the copper-catalyzed
click reaction in which 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles were formed
from azides and terminal alkynes. The toxicity of copper prompted
Sletten and Bertozzi to explore copper-free click chemistry using
strain-promoted azide–alkyn cyclocaddition (SPAAC). SPAAC has
been of great interest in the field of molecular imaging where radio-
and fluorescence-labeling strategies have been independently studied.2,13 The required ligands (e.g., dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) or bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne
(BCN) groups) are commercially available, and this reaction is one
of the most-studied in the field of bioorthogonal chemistry. Despite
the fact that click chemistry for in vivo fluorescence imaging has
already been applied,14,15 the synthesis of click-chemistry-based
hybrid tracers is, to date, only described using antibodies and not
peptides.16 A design wherein the fluorophore
also fulfills the role as linker (Scheme 1, right) has, to the best of our knowledge,
only been researched using 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene
(BODIPY) dyes.16 Use of a small-molecule,
copper-free click-based design incorporating cyanine dyes as a linker
has not yet been described.

The aim of this study was therefore
to evaluate the use of a click-chemistry-based
labeling strategy for peptides to improve the ease of synthesis and
synthetic yield of peptide-based hybrid tracers while creating a conjugated
tracer with a more compact structure (Scheme 1). To study the influence of chemically introduced
alterations in the context of earlier end-conjugated tracer developments
(resulting in reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK];17Scheme 1B), the well-known αvβ3-integrin-targeting
RGD peptide (c[RGDyK]) was chosen as the targeting moiety.17−19 In the novel tracer design, the heterobifunctional dye functions
as a linker that enables the coupling of both a chelator, e.g., diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA), and the targeting vector (resulting in DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]; Scheme 1C). DBCO and BCN were chosen as click handles due to
their availability and reaction kinetics (k = 310
and 140 × 10–3 M–1 s–1, respectively). As a constant factor in both the
end-labeled and click-chemistry-based strategies, the heterobifunctional
Cy5 dye was incorporated in the tracer design based on the outcome
of previous studies; a tracer’s biodistribution can be optimized
by shielding the dye from the environment.20 Previous studies wherein the fluorescent component of a hybrid tracer
was optimized to provide beneficial properties for in vivo use resulted
in the selection of N3(SO3)-Cy5-COOH.17,21,22 As such, the use of this dye was—together
with the DTPA molecule and RGD targeting vector—implemented
as a constant factor in both the end-labeled (reference) and click-chemistry-based
synthesis strategies. The chemical and photophysical properties, along
with in vivo biodistribution, of the RGD-based hybrid tracers were
analyzed using photophysical analysis and biological evaluation in
vitro and in vivo as outlined by the European Association of Nuclear
Medicine.41

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
As a general synthon for all compounds in
this study, the Phth(SO3)-Cy5-COOH dye was prepared. Following its coupling to c[RGDyK]
using standard NHS chemistry, this heterobifunctional Cy5 dye functioned
as a linker unit for further synthetic modifications. By using an
adapted version of the Gabriel synthesis, the amine could easily be
liberated. Subsequent diazotransfer23 with
1H-imidazolesulfonyl azide·HCl could be performed,
which resulted in N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]. This modification
supported SPAAC with either DBCO–DTPA or BCN–DTPA, resulting
in DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], respectively (Scheme 1).

Photophysical and Chemical Properties
To assess the
influence that the chemical alterations exerted on the dyes’
and hybrid tracers’ photophysical properties, the molar extinction
coefficient (ε) and quantum yield (ΦF) were
assessed to evaluate the brightness (ε· ΦF).7

Solvent polarity plays a large
role in ε; the ε value of N3(SO3)-Cy5-COOH in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was reduced by 40% when changing to
H2O (218 × 103 M–1 cm–1 in DMSO vs 131 × 103 M–1 cm–1 in H2O), and a 13% reduction was
seen when phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used (189 × 103 M–1 cm–1), which is in
line with previous results.22 The relative
ΦF of N3(SO3)-Cy5-COOH was similar
to methyl-Cy5-COOH(22) (precursor
to DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK]; ΦF = 13% for both dyes in PBS).

The brightness
of the precursor for the triazole-based hybrid tracers
(N3(SO3)-Cy5-COOH) was in the same range as the
precursor for the end-labeled design (methyl-Cy5-COOH; 29 × 103 vs 28 × 103 M–1 cm–1, respectively). When the click reaction incorporating
DBCO was used to form DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], virtually no change in brightness was observed compared to N3(SO3)-Cy5-COOH (23 × 103 vs 25 ×
103 M–1 cm–1, respectively).
The brightness was, however, enhanced to 40 × 103 M–1 cm–1 for DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]. The reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] had an
even higher brightness (50 × 103 M–1 cm–1). Cis–trans isomerization around the polymethine bridge plays a large role in
the differences in brightness,24 ,25 but since the BCN
moiety is considerably less bulky than its DBCO counterpart, it seems
that intra- or intermolecular interactions other than steric hindrance
caused this effect.

By using the shake-flask method with radiolabeled
hybrid tracer,
the partition coefficients in octanol/H2O (log P(o/w)) were determined for all three hybrid
tracers as log P(o/w) = −2.55
± 0.10, −1.45 ± 0.03, and −2.67 ± 0.12
for [99mTc]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], [99mTc]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], and [99mTc]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK], respectively (Table 1). These data indicated, surprisingly, that [99mTc]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] was the most lipophilic compound of the three,
while [99mTc]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and the reference tracer [99mTc]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] had similar lipophilicities.

Serum Interaction
and Chemical Stability
Depending
on their functionalization, cyanine dyes can form strong noncovalent
bonds with serum proteins, e.g., albumin. In addition, the dyes can
also be metabolically degraded,17,21,22,26,27 yielding circulation of tracer fragments in an in vivo setting.
Such degradation underlines the pressing need for serum interaction
assays during preclinical research. A serum binding assay for the
two triazole-containing RGD-targeting hybrid tracers revealed
no significant differences between the two click analogues (44 ±
2% bound for DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and
40 ± 2% bound for DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]; Figure 1A) and the
reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (36 ± 5% bound; p > 0.05 for all comparisons).17 Hence,
the difference in lipophilicity did not seem to affect the serum binding
ability of the different hybrid traceranalogues.

Dye stabilities of >94% were found after incubation with
non-heat-inactivated
serum (24 h; 37 °C), which was in line with earlier reports for
Cy5 dyes22,28 (Figure 1B,C).

In Vitro Localization and Receptor Affinity
Fluorescence
confocal imaging in mixed-cell culture experiments revealed comparable
uptake of the reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (Figure 2Ai) in αVβ3-positive cells (Cy5-related uptake in red) compared to both DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (Figure 2Aii) and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (Figure 2Aiii). Uptake
in αVβ3-negative cells present in
the mixed-cell culture was not seen (Figure 2A,B, with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged
membranous reference in bright green). Blocking studies confirmed
selective binding of the tracers to αVβ3 (Figure 2B);
incubation with unlabeled c[RGDyK] resulted in a statistically significant
decrease in uptake of the reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (94 ±
6%) and both triazole-containing tracers DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (86 ± 8%) and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (83 ± 24%; Figure 2C; p < 0.0001).

3.

Flow-cytometry-based affinity
measurements showed that the affinity
of DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] for the αvβ3 integrin (KD = 17.5 ± 6.0; Figure 2D) was significantly increased compared to the previously
reported affinity of the reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (KD = 30.3 ± 5.7, p >
0.0001; Figure 2D,
black).17,21 The receptor affinity of DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] was significantly lower (KD = 76.5 ±
18.3, p > 0.0001; Figure 2D, green) than that of the reference tracer DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK], but still in the lower nanomolar range.

In Vivo Imaging and Biodistribution
To assess the effect
of implementation of triazole-based click chemistry on the in vivo
targeting efficiency and pharmacokinetics of the RGD tracers, [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] were directly
compared to the end-conjugated reference tracer [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK]. To this end, single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging (Figure 3A), fluorescence imaging (Figure 3B), and quantitative assessment
of the in vivo biodistribution of [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (Figure 3C) were
performed using identical experimental settings as used previously
(i.e., at 24 h after intravenous administration of 1 nmol of the respective
hybrid RGD tracer derivative).17,21 Both SPECT and fluorescence
imaging of tumor-bearing mice resulted in tumor visualization after
administration of [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK], [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], or [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (Figure 3A,B, respectively, i and ii;
tumor encircled in red). Besides tumor visualization, SPECT imaging
also enabled visual assessment of the biodistribution of the hybrid
tracers, revealing a dominant kidney accumulation for all compounds
(Figure 3A) and a relatively
high uptake in other nontargeted organs for [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (Figure 3Aiii). It
was suspected that the visibility of the tumor when using [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] was further impeded by the location of the tumor.

was included as previously presented by Bunschoten et al.17 Significance between the hybrid triazole-containing
RGD conjugates and the reference annotated as: ****p ≤ 0.0001, ***p ≤ 0.001, **p ≤ 0.01, *p ≤ 0.05, and
ns = p > 0.05.

The ex vivo biodistribution data not only underlined the
imaging
observations but also revealed differences (Figure 3C), e.g., in tumor uptake: [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] have tumor uptakes of 3.5 ± 1.7
and 2.9 ± 1.7% ID/g, respectively. [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK], with a tumor uptake of 1.6 ± 0.3%
ID/g, is significantly different from [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (p = 0.0312), but is in the same range as [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (p > 0.05). The tumor-to-muscle
ratios (T/M) of both [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (4.8 ± 2.1)
and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (5.1 ± 1.5) were, however, clearly
negatively affected by nonspecific signal present in adjoining muscle
tissue; compared to these two tracers, the T/M of the reference tracer [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] was found
to be superior (12.8 ± 1.8; p < 0.0001 for
both comparisons). Nevertheless, the tumors could still be visualized
in vivo with fluorescence imaging despite the lower T/M (Figure 3B).

Affinity
values are generally used to explain T/M ratios.17 In this case, however, the measured affinities
did not directly link to the tumor uptake or T/M ratios; both [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] have an affinity
in the same nanomolar range as [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK], but their T/M ratio is significantly
reduced compared to the reference tracer [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (p <
0.0001). Other than affinity, differences in charge, lipophilicity,
and/or serum binding also influence the T/M ratio. In this case, a
trend (albeit nonsignificant) was observed for serum binding
([111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] > [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] > [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK]; see Figure 1A; n = 3),
which seemed to translate to changes in the biodistribution values;
in vivo, the trend became more pronounced and differences were statistically significant.
The fact that this uptake pattern was similar for all of the evaluated
organs (Figure 3C; n = 6) further suggested a generic effect; serum binding
has e.g. been the culprit for such observations in previously
reported results.27

For all compounds,
renal retention was by far the highest, and
the uptake of [111In]DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and [111In]DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] was significantly
higher compared to that of the reference tracer [111In]DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK] (14.7 ± 3.2, 22.0 ±
5.7, and 3.0 ± 1.4% ID/g, respectively; p ≤
0.0001). As the αVβ3 integrin is
ubiquitous in the kidney, some renal accumulation of the RGD-containing
conjugates can be expected;29,30 however, considering conditions
between groups were identical, this explanation appeared inadequate.
This effect could also not be explained based on the lipophilicity
of the compounds (see above). Hence, it seems that the increase in
renal uptake of the triazole-containing RGD hybrid tracers is attributable
to the introduction of triazole-containing moieties formed by click
chemistry. Literature indicates that some triazoles, e.g., Isavuconazole,
are characterized by prolonged high kidney uptake31 and that 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole irreversibly binds to catalase
proteins,32,33 thus implying that these moieties may induce
this behavior. It is generally known that molecular alterations and
their size have an undisputed effect on the biodistribution, but no
prior research regarding the influence of the moieties resulting from
copper-free click chemistry has been published to date to the best
of our knowledge.

Besides SPAAC and its triazole product, other
forms of bioorthogonal
click chemistry such as the isocyanide [4 + 1] cyclocaddition or inverse
electron demand Diels–Alder (IEDDA) could also be employed
in the design of a hybrid tracer. However, while IEDDA (k= 1–10 × 106M–1s–1) is considerably faster than SPAAC  (k = 10–2–1 M–1 s–1)34 and has been
used previously in pretargeting strategies,35,36 the effect of IEDDA on the in vivo characteristics of a tracer without
an antibody has not yet been investigated. That being said, given
the relatively large effects that the triazole-containing moieties
have been shown to exert, it would be of great interest to compare
the effect of both types of copper-free click chemistry in an
in vivo setting.

As previously mentioned, the 1,2,3-triazole-containing
moiety introduced
by click chemistry seemed to have a negative effect on the pharmacokinetics
of RGD-based hybrid tracers, but the utility of the heterobifunctional
design regarding other targets and/or other targeting moieties should
be considered in future studies considering e.g. receptor pockets
can vary. The composition of the hybrid tracer plays a large role
in the pharmacokinetics of small-molecule-based hybrid tracers,20 but such an effect could prove negligible with
larger structures such as nanobody-, antibody-, or nanoparticle-based
hybrid tracers. Further exploration of whether this design holds promise
for other targets, with or without click chemistry, is thus warranted.

Conclusions
Despite the tracer’s stability and good
in vitro performance
of triazole-based hybrid tracers, biodistribution data indicated that
incorporation of the relatively bulky chemical modifications used
for the copper-free click conjugation in RGD-targeting hybrid tracer
design has a negative effect on its pharmacokinetics, although the
tumors could still be visualized. Thus, the design could hold promise
for other targets and/or targeting moieties.

Methods
All chemicals
were obtained from commercial sources and used without
further purification. Solvents were obtained from Actu-All Chemicals
(Oss, The Netherlands) in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
or peptide grade and used without further purification. The reactions
were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and/or mass spectrometry
using a Bruker microflex LRF matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). HPLC was performed on a Waters (Etten-Leur,
The Netherlands) HPLC system using a 1525EF pump and a 2489 UV/vis
detector. For preparative HPLC, a Dr. Maisch GmbH (Ammerbuch, Germany)
Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 10 μm (250 × 20 mm2)
column was used (12 mL/min). For semipreparative HPLC, a Dr. Maisch
GmbH Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ 10 μm (250 × 10 mm2) or a Waters XBridge BEH C8 10 μm (250 × 10 mm2) Prep OBD column was used (5 mL/min). For analytical HPLC, a Dr.
Maisch GmbH Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ 5 μm (250 × 4.6 mm2) column was used. For all HPLC runs, a gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) in H2O/CH3CN 95:5 to 0.1% TFA in
H2O/CH3CN 5:95 in 40 min was used. Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra were taken using a Bruker DPX-300 spectrometer
(300 MHz 1H NMR, 75 MHz 13C NMR), and chemical
shifts (δ) are reported relative to TMS (δ = 0) and/or
referenced to the solvent in which they were measured. Abbreviations

monitored by absorption spectroscopy. After stirring at 60 °C
overnight, the mixture was heated to 120 °C. The crude product
was dissolved in DMF/CH2Cl2 (70 mL; 1:1) after
precipitation in diethyl ether (600 mL). Merrifield resin (1.2 g,

and was then left to bubble in 20% TFA in CH2Cl2 (50.0 mL) for 1 h and in 20% DiPEA (50.0 mL) in CH2Cl2 for 15 min. The dissolved hemicyanine was then added to the
preconditioned resin. After bubbling through N2 for 1 h,
the resin was washed with DMF/CH2Cl2 (20 mL;
1:1) thrice. (SO3)Indole-AmineC4Phth (0.44 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine/acetic anhydride (40

shaken overnight at r.t. Afterward, the liquids were collected and
the resin was washed with DMF and/or CH2Cl2 until
the washings were light blue. The crude reaction mixture was concentrated
in vacuo and separated by column chromatography (CH2Cl2: CH3OH) and then further purified by prep-HPLC,

Photophysical Properties
Absorption coefficient (ε),
quantum yield (ΦF), and maximum absorption/emission
measurements of N3(SO3)-Cy5-COOH and its two conjugates
(DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] and DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]), serum stability analysis, and serum
binding experiments were performed according to the previously described
methods.21,22 The brightness of the hybrid tracers was
based on their respective quantum yield and εfluorophore.

Lipophilicity
log P(o/w) was calculated according to previously published methods.43 In short, to a solution of 0.5–1 MBq
of 99mTc radiolabeled hybrid tracer in 500 μL
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), 500 μL of 1-octanol
was added (n = 6). Vials were vigorously shaken on
a IKA VXR basic Vibrax orbital shaker (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG,
Staufen, Germany) for 3 min and subsequently centrifuged at 6000 rpm
for 5 min in a Fisher Scientific MicroV centrifuge (Fisher Scientific,
Hampton) to achieve quantitative phase separation. The activity concentrations
in 100 μL samples of both the aqueous and organic phases were
measured in a PerkinElmer Wizard2 γ-counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham).

In Vitro Tracer Specificity
A mix of αVβ3-integrin-expressing Geβ3 cells and MDAMB231
X4 cells40 was seeded onto coverslips (ø35
mm; MatTek Corporation) and incubated at 37 °C in 2 mL of medium
for 48 h. One hour prior to imaging, the cells were incubated (37
°C) with DTPA-Lys(Cy5(SO3)methyl)-Cys-c[RGDyK], DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK], or DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] (1 μM). For blocking experiments, 1 μM unlabeled c[RGDyK]
was added 1 h prior to addition of DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] or DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK]. Prior to imaging,
the cells were washed three times with PBS. Confocal microscopy was
performed on viable cells, using an SP8 WLL fluorescence confocal
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar). For additional reference,
the nuclei of the cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 mg/mL stock,
Thermo Fisher). Sequential scanning settings were used to visualize
the different fluorescent features: Hoechst (nuclear staining; λex 405 nm, λem 42–470 nm), intrinsic
GFP (λex 500 nm, λem 500–550
nm; MDAMB231 X4 only), and Cy5 (λex 633 nm, λem 650–700 nm). Quantification of cellular uptake was
performed as previously described.15 In
images depicting the Cy5-related signal intensity, regions of interest
were placed around the whole cell (minimum of 13 cells per image)
using Fuji software, whereafter the pixel intensity per cell could
be determined. Unblocked and blocked conditions were evaluated for
all three tracers (n = 3 experiments per condition).
For the unblocked conditions, the percentage of fluorescence uptake
(intensity per cell) was set at 100%. The percentage fluorescence
uptake after blocking was determined relative to the unblocked condition.

Receptor Affinity
The affinity (KD) of the tracers for Geβ3 cells was determined by saturation
binding experiments. To this end, 3 × 105 cells were
incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with different concentrations of either DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] or DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] ranging from 0 to 1500 nM. To accomplish
this, Geβ3 cells were trypsinized, pelleted (4 min, 1200 rpm,
4 °C), and resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; enriched with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/strepcillin
(1:1 v/v)) to obtain a concentration of 6 × 106 cells/mL.
Subsequently, 50 μL of the cell suspension (3 × 105 cells) was added to 50 μL of the tracer in cold DMEM
(0–3000 nM). After 1 h incubation at 4 °C, the samples
were washed three times with 0.1% fetal calf serum in cold PBS by
pelleting (4 min, 1200 rpm, 4 °C) and subsequently resuspended
in 150 μL of 0.1% fetal calf serum in cold PBS. The samples
were then measured by flow cytometry using an LSR-II after excitation
at 633 nm and collecting the signal in the APC-A channel. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Normalized geometric means were
fitted with equations in the GraphPad Prism 7 software. The KD values were calculated using the “Binding–Saturation,
One site–Total” nonlinear regression equation (eq 1), with the background
value set at 0. 1  where y = normalized fluorescence, Bmax = maximum
specific binding in the units
of the y-axis, x = concentration
of the hybrid labeled tracer, KD = equilibrium
dissociation constant of the hybrid labeled tracer in nanomolar.

Radiolabeling
For logP experiments, 66 μL of
10 μM Tin(II)chloride dihydrate in sodium acetate buffer (250
mM, pH 4.0) and 6 MBq of 99mTc in 7–11 μL
saline were added to 1 nmol compound dissolved in a NH4OAc buffer (250 mM, pH 5.5). After shaking at room temperature for
5 min, the radiochemical purity was determined to be >90% using
iTLC
with PBS as eluent.

For biodistribution experiments, 4 nmol
of either DTPA.DBCO.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] or DTPA.BCN.N3(SO3)-Cy5-c[RGDyK] was dissolved in a NH4OAc
buffer (0.25 M; pH = 5.5) and mixed with 12.2 μL of an 111InCl3 solution in 0.05 M HCl (0.33 MBq/μL,
Mallinckrodt Medical, Petten, The Netherlands). The mixtures were
shaken for 1 h at r.t. After addition of HCl (0.05 M; 232 μL),
the mixtures were supplemented with isotonic PBS to obtain a volume
of 600 μL, and 150 μL (1 nmol) per mouse was then injected.

For combined imaging and biodistribution experiments, 2 nmol of
each compound, dissolved in a NH4OAc buffer (0.25 M; pH
= 5.5), was mixed with 121.9 μL of an 111InCl3 solution in 0.05 M HCl (0.33 MBq/μL, Mallinckrodt Medical,
Petten, The Netherlands). The mixtures were shaken for 1 h at r.t.,
whereafter the mixtures were supplemented with isotonic PBS to obtain
an injection volume of 300 μL.

In Vivo Imaging and Biodistribution
The 4T1 tumor model
was generated in BALB/c nude mice, as previously described.27 The animal studies were approved by the institutional
Animal Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center.

Imaging and biodistribution were performed 24 h after intravenous
tracer (1 nmol) administration (n = 6 animals for
each tracer; n = 4 biodistribution only, 2 SPECT
imaging/biodistribution). SPECT imaging was performed as previously
described.17,21 Maximum intensity projection
images were generated and analyzed using Matlab software (MathWorks,
Natick, MA) according to previously described methods.21 Hereafter, fluorescence imaging was performed
in vivo and ex vivo using an IVIS Spectrum imaging system (Caliper
Life Science, Hopkinton, MA). Images were acquired at λex = 640 nm, λem = 680 nm, and image analysis
was performed using the Living Image software from Xenogen v 3.2 (Caliper
LS). In vivo fluorescence images were used to provide a direct link
to the in vivo SPECT images.

For assessment of the biodistribution
of the tracers, the mice
were sacrificed and organs and tissues were surgically excised. The
amount of radioactivity in the tissues was counted using a γ
counter (2470 automatic γ counter, PerkinElmer, 245 keV, 60
s), and the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%
ID/g) was calculated according to previously described methods.17

Statistical Analysis
Analytical
data were expressed
as mean and standard deviation as calculated using Microsoft Excel
and GraphPad Prism 7 software. In this study, significance of two
mean values was calculated by the unpaired t-test
or one-way ANOVA unless noted otherwise. The level of significance
was set at p < 0.05.
