Morphology-controllable
preparation of Pt-based nanoalloys supporting
on carbonaceous materials is a potential strategy to enhance the catalytic
properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ethanol oxidation
reaction (EOR); they are recognized as irreplaceable electrode reactions
in proton-exchange membrane ethanol fuel cells. Herein, we exhibit
a facile, one-step synthesis method to directly prepare composition-tunable
PtCu alloy/graphene oxide (GO) hybrids. The structure of the as-synthesized
PtCu alloy/GO hybrids has been analyzed using transmission electron
microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
X-ray, X-ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. In the PtCu alloy/GO hybrids, the PtCu alloy nanoparticles
well disperse on GO, and the size is below 5.0 nm. The catalysis for
ORR and EOR of the as-synthesized PtCu/GO hybrids has been evaluated
in alkaline solution. Compared to commercial Pt/C, the PtCu/GO hybrids
exhibit much higher mass activity and stability. The mass activities
toward ORR/EOR on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids are
5.3/2.36 times higher than the commercial Pt/C. This study proves
that the as-synthesized PtCu/GO hybrids can be used as improved catalysts
for ORR and EOR in alkaline medium.

1 Introduction
Fuel
cells that transform chemical energy into electric energy
have given rise to great interest due to their potential application
for clean and sustainable systems of energy generation with many merits
such as low pollutant emission, high energy density, and low operating
temperature.1−10 So far, platinum (Pt) is still recognized to be the most active
and commonly used catalyst in fuel cells among the pure metal catalysts.
However, the activity, stability, and scarcity of Pt become the main
limiting factors impeding the commercial application of fuel cells.
To conquer these barriers, a variety of strategies have been exploited
to enhance the mass activity and/or stability: (1) reducing the size
of Pt catalyst, which can provide more active sites, thus increasing
Pt utilization per mass;11−13 (2) alloying with earth-abundant
transition metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, and Fe),14−20 which may boost the mass activity and stability of Pt-based catalysts
due to the synergetic effects that result from the change of the electronic
and chemical natures of nanoalloy surface;21−24 and (3) supporting the Pt-based
catalysts on the cheap carriers, which can not only permit one to
greatly reduce the loading of Pt but also increase the mass activity
and stability.25−33 Therefore, the combination of the above-mentioned factors is crucial
to real application of fuel cells.

So far, various techniques,
such as impregnation method,31,32 electrodeposition,34 microwave-assisted
process,35 supercritical method36 and ultrasonic method,37 have been employed to anchor the Pt-based nanoparticles on different
substrates for minimizing the precious Pt. However, these methods,
more or less, often have defects such as multistep, time-consuming
process, the pretreatment of the support, or weak governing of the
shape/dispersion of Pt-based nanocrystals on the support. For instance,
the unpretreated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are rather inert; to coat
the Pt-based nanocatalysts on the CNTs, CNTs must be pretreated in
a mixture of HNO3 and H2SO4 through
refluxing.38,39 Compared to CNTs, the graphene
oxide (GO) has larger surface area and abundant functional groups
on the surface, thus leading to easier anchoring of the Pt-based nanocatalysts
on GO.27,40,41 However, the
development of a facile method to fabricating GO–Pt-based nanocrystal
hybrids with size, shape, and dispersion control is of significant
challenge.

Herein, we introduce a direct, one-pot synthesis
method to prepare
sub-5.0 nm PtCu alloy supported on GO based on our previous report.42 The obtained PtCu alloy nanoparticles have uniform
size and are well dispersed on GO. The as-prepared PtCu/GO hybrids
displayed much higher mass activity and stability than commercial
Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ethanol oxidation reaction
(EOR) in alkaline medium.

2 Results and Discussion
In a typical synthesis, copper(II) acetylacetonate (Cu(acac)2), platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2), sodium
iodide (NaI), and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP-8000) were dissolved
in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).
Then, hydroxylamine hydrochloride and graphene oxide (GO) were introduced
to the mixed solution and stirred for 12 h. The resulting mixture
was solvothermally treated in a 10 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave at 130 °C for 8 h. The morphology of the obtained products
was first observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1a,b are the typical
TEM images of the as-synthesized products. As can been seen, many
uniform particles dispersed on the GO. The size of particles range
from 4.2 to 5.1 nm, and the mean dimension is around 4.68 ± 0.06
nm (Figure 2a). After
careful observation, we found that these particles were polyhedral
in shape with many corners and edges (Figure 1c,d). Besides, the result of inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) displayed that the atomic
percentage of Pt and Cu was 75.4:24.6 (the sample was denoted Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO). Furthermore, the energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectra (Figure 2b) verified that the products consisted of Pt and Cu and the
atomic percentages of Pt and Cu were 73.2:26.8, which was very much
in accord with the result of ICP-MS. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra
(Figure 2c) of the
as-prepared Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids have four
diffraction peaks referred to as (111), (200), (220), and (311) lattice
planes of the face-centered cubic crystal structure of Pt (JCPDS-65-2868).
Peaks of pure Pt or pure Cu cannot be observed. Compared to pure Pt,
these peaks moved to a bigger angle, which is caused by the small
Cu atoms entering the Pt lattice,43−45 and this implied the
formation of PtCu alloy. Besides, the analysis of EDX line scanning
further confirmed the PtCu alloy structure (Figure 2d).

curves of one Pt75.4Cu24.6 nanoparticle.

It is generally accepted that
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is used to analyze the sub-2.0 nanometer region of nanoparticles. Figure 3a,b shows the XPS
spectra of Pt 4f and Cu 2p for the as-synthesized Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids. The atomic ratio of Pt/Cu is 77.2:27.8,
which is very close to the result of ICP-MS. The 4f7/2 and
4f5/2 regions of metallic Pt peaked at around 71.08 and
74.38 eV, respectively (Figure 3a). The 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 regions of metallic
Cu peaked at around 932.0 and 952.0 eV, respectively (Figure 3b). The XPS analysis shows
that the Pt 4f binding energy of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids is slightly blue-shifted relative to standard Pt.42,46,47 On the other hand, the peaks
of Cu 2p of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids are also
blue-shift compared to that of standard Cu. These results indicate
Pt atoms and Cu atoms have a mutual interaction of electrons in the
Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids and also imply PtCu
alloy formation. Previous works on Pt-based alloys also recorded the
downshifts of the d-band center and found such a downshift may lower
the oxygen adsorption strength, improve oxygenated intermediates adsorption/desorption,
and enhance the ORR activity.48−50 Furthermore, by changing the
raw ratio of Cu and Pt precursors, the Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids (Figure 4; the component was decided using ICP-MS) can be also prepared in
the current synthetic system. As shown in Figure 4a–c, the diameter of PtCu nanoparticles
was also below 5.0 nm, and the results of XRD, EDX, and EDX line scanning
showed that the PtCu nanoparticles were alloy structure.

The electrocatalytic properties of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids and Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids
toward
ORR were evaluated and compared to commercial Pt/C (Figure 5 shows TEM images of commercial
of Pt/C, with many similar particles dispersed on the carbon; the
size of these particle ranges from 2.7 to 3.6 nm). Figure 6a shows the cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curves of catalysts recorded with a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1 in N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte.
As can be seen, there are distinct adsorption/desorption regions on
Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids, Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids, and Pt/C from −0.8 to −0.45
V, which means that the surface structures of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids and Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids
are different from that of Pt/C due to the Pt alloying with Cu. The
electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO and Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids and Pt/C are,
respectively, 23.9, 20, and 50.0 m2·g–1 obtained by assuming a value of 210 μC·cm–2 of the hydrogen adsorption/desorption region of CVs.51,52 The ORR polarization curves (Figure 6b) of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO, Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO, and Pt/C were obtained using a rotation
rate of 1600 rpm at room temperature; the electrolyte was O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, and the scan rate was 10 mV·s–1. It shows that the half-wave potential of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO was 0.928 V, which obviously enhances 52 mV higher
than a commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.876 V). The mass activity on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids is 0.74 A·mgPt–1 at 0.9 V using a reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) as the reference, and this value is 1.35 times higher than that
of Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids (0.55 A·mgPt–1) and 5.3 times higher than that of Pt/C
(0.14 A·mgPt–1) (Figure 6c), 2.1 times higher than our
previously reported sub-5.0 nm Pt68Cu32 polyhedral
alloys,42 3.5 times higher than PtCu nanoframes,49 and 6.1 times higher than sub-5.0 nm Pt3Cu nanoparticles.50 Furthermore,
the specific activities on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO,
Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO, and Pt/C are 3.0, 2.75, and
0.28 mA·cm–2, respectively, which implies that
the specific activity on PtCu/GO hybrids is around 10 times higher
than that on Pt/C (Figure S1) and is still
superior to previously reported sub-5.0 nm Pt68Cu32 polyhedral alloys,42 PtCu nanoframes,49 and sub-5.0 nm Pt3Cu nanoparticles50 (Figure S2). The
stability of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO was studied through
accelerated degradation testing and performed with a linear potential
scanning method; the potential cycle was from 0.6 to 1.0 V at 100
mV·s–1 in an O2-saturated 0.1 M
KOH electrolyte. The Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO also shows
much better mass activity than Pt/C after going through 1000 cycles.
The mass activity on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO (0.41 A·mgPt–1) is 3.4 times higher than that of Pt/C
(0.12 A·mgPt–1) (Figure 6d). The Tafel plots also show
that the Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids display greatly
higher activity than do the commercial Pt/C catalysts (Figure 6e,f). However, the TEM images
(Figure S3a) of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO after the durability test show that the particles have
aggregation tendency. Simultaneously, the dealloying process of PtCu
alloy happens because some hollows appear in the particles (Figure S3b,c) during the durability test. These
would lead to the activity decline of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO.

Generally, the ORR on metal nanoparticles is considered as
a multielectron
reaction.53−55 For the sake of determining the electron transfer
number on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO, the ORR polarization
curves of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO were investigated
by rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements at different rotation
rates from 100 to 2500 rpm in 0.1 M KOH solution (Figure 7a), and the Koutecky–Levich
(K–L) equation was employed to calculate the electron transfer
number on catalysts.53−56 As a comparison, the ORR polarization curves of Pt/C are also tested.
The Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots for Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO calculated at different potentials of 0.6 and
0.8 V are shown in Figure 7b. According to the calculated results, the electron transfer
number on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO is determined to be
around 4, which shows that the ORR on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid is a 4-electron process. And this result is similar to
the Pt/C (Figure 7c,d).

The electrocatalytic properties of the as-synthesized Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid, Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO
hybrids, and the commercial Pt/C catalyst have also been investigated
toward EOR in alkaline electrolyte. The current density (J) was normalized by ECSA and Pt loading. Figure 8a,b shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs)
of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid, Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids, and the commercial Pt/C catalyst in
N2-saturated 0.5 M KOH + 0.5 M ethanol solution with a
scan rate of 50 mV·s–1 at room temperature.
The specific activity (J) on the as-synthesized Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid is 12.3 mA·cm–2, which is 1.07 times higher than that on Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids (11.5 mA·cm–2) and 4.96
times higher than that on the commercial Pt/C catalyst (2.48 mA·cm–2) (Figure 8a). The mass activity on the Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid is 2.93 A·mgPt–1, which
is 1.27 times higher than that on Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids (2.30 A·mgPt–1) and
2.36 times higher than that on the commercial Pt/C catalyst (1.24
A·mgPt–1) (Figure 8b). Moreover, the onset potential on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid and Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids is much lower than that on commercial Pt/C
(Figure 8c), which
implies the much faster reaction kinetics toward ethanol oxidation
on PtCu/GO hybrid. The stability of the prepared PtCu/GO hybrid was
investigated through fixed potential amperometry performed at −0.1
V for 1 h (Figure 8d). As shown, the current density of PtCu/GO hybrids is bigger than
that of Pt/C over the entire time, indicating their enhanced catalytic
stability.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
this study introduces a one-step method to prepare
composition-tunable PtCu alloys/GO hybrids. The catalytic performances
of the as-prepared PtCu/GO hybrids toward ORR and EOR have been evaluated
in alkaline medium. The as-synthesized Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids exhibit a mass activity of 0.74 A·mgPt–1 at 0.9 V versus RHE. This value is, respectively,
5.3 and 2.1 times higher than Pt/C (0.14 A·mgPt–1) and our previously reported, unsupported sub-5.0
nm Pt68Cu32 polyhedral alloys (0.34 A·mgPt–1). Compared to commercial Pt/C, the as-synthesized
Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrids also display improved
electrocatalytic properties toward EOR. The mass activity on Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO hybrid (2.93 A·mgPt–1) is 2.36 times higher than that on Pt/C (1.24
A·mgPt–1). The current–time
curves indicate that the stability of Pt75.4Cu24.6/GO is better than that of Pt/C. Thus, this study provides a new
type of catalyst with enhanced mass activity and stability toward
ORR and EOR in alkaline medium.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of Pt75.4Cu24.6 Alloy/GO Hybrids
First, 12.0 mg of Pt(acac)2, 15.8 mg of Cu(acac)2, 99.2 mg of NaI, and 30.0 mg of
poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP-8000) were added into 8 mL of DMF solution
and stirred for 15 min. Then, 70.0 mg of hydroxylamine hydrochloride
and 38.7 mg of graphene oxide were added to the mixed solution and
stirred for 12 h. The homogeneous solution was poured into a 10 mL
Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Finally, the sealed vessel
was placed for 8 h at 130 °C. The products were collected by
centrifugation and washing cycles at 10 000 rpm for 30 min
with ethanol for three times. The obtained product was redispersed
in ethanol. By changing the amounts of Pt(acac)2 (12.0
mg) and Cu(acac)2 (23.7 mg) precursors, the Pt68.2Cu31.8/GO hybrids can also be prepared in the current
system.

4.2 Electrocatalytic Test
CHI 760E electrochemical
analyzer (CHI Instruments, Shanghai, Chenghua Co., Ltd.) was used
to record electrocatalytic tests performed in a standard glass three-electrode
cell at room temperature. Before the electrocatalytic test, alumina
powder with sizes of 1, 0.5, and 0.05 μm was used to polish
the glassy carbon (GC, Φ = 5 mm) electrode. The ink of catalyst
was prepared by taking a certain amount of PtCu alloy/GO hybrids and
Pt/C powder to disperse in superpure water under an ultrasonic bath.
The working electrode was prepared by spreading the ink on the GC
electrode, dried under infrared lamp, and, finally, 4 μL of
Nafion diluents (1 wt % Nafion solution) was spread onto the electrode
surface.

The CV curves were recorded in N2-saturated
0.1 M KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1 ranging from −0.8 to 0.2 V (Ag/AgCl). To obtain a stable
CV curve, the scan was cycled several times.

CV tests toward
ethanol oxidation were performed from −0.9
to 0.4 V (Ag/AgCl) with a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1 in 0.5 M ethanol + 0.5 M KOH electrolyte.

ORR test was recorded
with a CHI 760E electrochemical analyzer
(CHI Instruments, Shanghai, Chenghua Co., Ltd.) and a GC rotating
disk electrode (RDE). A reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and Pt
mesh (1 cm × 1 cm) were utilized as a reference and counter electrode,
respectively. The working electrode was prepared by dropping catalyst
ink obtained by dispersing samples in a mixture of ethanol and water
(volume ratio is 1:1) onto the GC RDE (geometric area of GC is 0.196
cm2 (Φ = 5 mm)). After the evaporation of solvent
under an infrared lamp, 5 μL of Nafion diluents (0.1 wt % Nafion
solution) was transferred onto the electrode surface before test.
The ORR was carried out from 0.15 to 1.05 V (vs RHE) at a scan rate
of 10 mV·s–1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm
in 0.1 M KOH at room temperature after inletting O2 for
half an hour until saturated. The ORR curves were corrected for capacitive
currents in N2 saturation. The kinetic current (ik) was calculated from the ORR curves based
on the Koutecky–Levich equation: (1/i = 1/ik + 1/iL) at 0.90
V and ECSA of each catalyst was utilized to normalize the current
density. In the equation, iL and i, respectively, stand for the diffusion limiting current
and measured current (0.90 V) at the kinetic-diffusion control region.
