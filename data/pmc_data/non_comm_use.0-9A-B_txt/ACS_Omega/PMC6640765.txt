Introduction
The exfoliation of
graphite into graphene in 2004 by Geim and Novoselov
has revolutionized the domains of electronics and paved the way for
a new area of research on ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials.1,2 These atomically thin materials are generally obtained by the different
exfoliation techniques such as mechanical cleavage, liquid-phase exfoliation,
ion intercalation, etc. from their bulk-layered counterparts.3−5 The extraordinary performance of a single-layer graphene, which
is an electrically conducting material, became the seed for the growth
of other 2D materials such as boron nitride, transition-metal dichalcogenides,
black phosphorous, and many more, which display a broad range of electrical
properties from insulating to conducting. Interestingly, the single-
and few-layered materials generally exhibit much better mechanical,
electrical, and optical performances compared to those of their bulk
counterparts, and this led to a resurged interest in the research
on atomically thin materials in recent years.6−9

Among the layered materials,
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the
insulating analogue of graphene with boron and nitrogen atoms in the
alternate positions of a regular hexagon. This atomically flat material
possesses extremely high thermal conductivity, very high thermal stability,
and exceptional dimensional stability.10−12 This unusual combination
of properties, such as electrical insulating nature, together with
high thermal conductivity of BN, qualifies it for use in a plethora
of applications such as electronic packaging materials, coatings,
lubricants, and also as an ideal substrate for high-performance graphene
electronics.13−17 Boron nitride nanosheet films have also been widely used industrially
as a water repellent and as self-cleaning materials.18 BN has been utilized for the preparation of highly thermal
conductive, thermally stable, and mechanically robust polymer composites
for various applications.19−22 For specific PMMA-based polymer composites with 80
wt % functionalized BN, a thermal conductivity of >10 W m–1 K–1 was reported.23 The graphene devices fabricated on hBN substrates showed better
mobilities and carrier inhomogenities than those on SiO2 substrates,24 and the breakdown field
of the hBN dielectric is comparable to that of SiO2.25 Recently, Lee et al. developed a flexible and
transparent field effect transistor using hBN as the dielectric, graphene
as the top and bottom electrodes, and MoS2 as the channel.26 They utilized the mechanical stacking, followed
by electron beam lithography, for the complete realization of the
device. In 2015, Jeong et al. developed a semiconductor–insulator–semiconductor
diode consisting of monolayer MoS2, hBN, and epitaxially
grown GaN, wherein hBN was used as the insulating material because
of its higher thermal and dielectric stability.27 In this way, ultrathin 2D structures and flexible electronic
devices were realized and are constantly pushing the limits of knowledge
into newer horizons.

In conventional flexible electronics, functional
nano inks are
printed onto flexible substrates, thereby generating various devices
and components for energy harvesting, radiofrequency (RF) communication,
smart packaging, and flexible display applications.28,29 Among the various printing technologies available, screen printing
allows large-area printing under ambient conditions, often resulting
in thick printed layers of few micrometers, and is compatible with
a wide variety of substrates and functional inks.30,31 Here, inks of suitable viscosity are pressed on patterned meshes
with the help of a squeegee in order to obtain the predesigned pattern
of interest on top of various substrates. Recently, Hyun et al. prepared
graphene inks of different viscosities and has been screen printed
with good resolution, which was further used for the fabrication of
printed thin-film transistors (TFTs).32 Jobin et al. developed dielectric inks of silica and zirconium silicate,
which possess suitable viscosity for screen printing and were curable
at room temperature as well.33,34 Screen printing has
also been utilized for the realization of many applications such as
the preparation of flexible conductive electrodes, flexible transistors,
etc.35,36

Just like the conducting materials
are important for device fabrication
such as TFTs, the insulating materials also play a vital role in determining
the device performance. The quality of the interface between the dielectric
and the semiconductor is very important as the carrier transport takes
place at these interfaces.31 Lee et al.
utilized a sol–gel-derived metal-oxide material as the gate
dielectric, and they printed the material using the wire bar printing
technique.37 The ink formulation of layered
materials is again a largely unexplored area, probably due to the
reaggregation of the exfoliated layers when formulated into the ink
of enough viscosity. A series of layered material exfoliation in water
and their subsequent ink formulation with polyethylene oxide as the
binder have been studied by Kim et al.38 Here, not many properties of the printed patterns were explored
except the conductivity of graphene. Graphene was also used for screen
printing by the gelation of the exfoliated nanosheets in the presence
of the polymer binder, which is capable of preventing the aggregation
of the exfoliated sheets and also provides higher viscosity suitable
for screen printing.39 In contrast, owing
to the complexities involving 2D structures, there are no significant
efforts on the colloidal ink formulation using hBN as the filler.
In 2014, Withers et al. directly used the liquid-exfoliated nanosheets
of different materials including hBN for the fabrication of heterostructures
using the inkjet printing technique.40 In
an another approach, hBN has been made into an ink by the density-gradient
ultracentrifugation technique in the presence of an amphiphilic block
copolymer, and subsequently ultrathin dielectric films were deposited
through a layer by layer approach.41 In
the present investigation, we take up the challenge of formulating
a screen-printable ink using ultrathin BN nanosheets, by adopting
a polymer-assisted delamination mechanism followed by centrifugation
and later adjusting the viscosity suitable for conventional screen
printing. Here, dimethyl formamide (DMF) was selected as the solvent
for exfoliation, whereas chloroform was used as the main vehicle in
the ink formulation. Polycarbonate (PC) was chosen as the polymer
binder because of its high glass-transition temperature and room temperature
solubility in the selected solvents. Printed patterns were well characterized
for the morphology, electrical properties, temperature stability,
etc. In addition, dielectric properties in the RF and microwave frequency
regions were thoroughly analyzed for the printed patterns of the hBN
ink.

Results and Discussion
The exfoliation of the layered material
was started with continuous
sonication of the bulk-layered BN in DMF. The polar nature of DMF
was reported to be effective in the exfoliation process of BN, because
of the interaction between the particle surface and the solvent molecule.42 In principle, the matching surface energy of
the solvent and the energy per unit area of the layered material helps
to overcome the van der Waals forces of attraction between the layers,
and this is the reason behind the delamination of the bulk material
into single or a few layers.42 This sonication-assisted
delamination is considered to be the simplest but efficient way of
exfoliation, which can result in high-quality 2D sheets.43 During sonication, the high-energy waves will
generate cavities, which will collapse into high-energy jets, which
in turn will break the bulk material into individual layers.44 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a
convenient technique to dig deep into the exfoliation characteristics
of layered materials. Figure 1a,b shows the TEM images of the exfoliated BN before adding
the polymer solution. When the bulk material is delaminated into thin
sheets of 2D nature, the thickness usually decreases down to less
than 1 nm. Because of this extremely thin nature, it will be transparent
to electron beams, which is evident from the low-magnification images
of TEM (Figure 1a,b).
This transparent nature is a clear evidence for the effective exfoliation
of hBN. The lateral dimensions of the delaminated sheets were reduced
when compared to that of the bulk hBN powder. The bulk material used
was of ∼1 μm in the lateral dimensions. The continuous
sonication in a congenial solvent can result in the reduction of the
thickness along with a reduction of the lateral dimensions, which
is common in liquid exfoliation.42,45 The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images shown in Figure 1c,d deliver more
testimonial information about the already exfoliated nanosheets. The
individual atoms of B and N can be clearly delineated from the different
contrast created by the respective electron densities of the individual
atoms.46 Here, it is quite logical to assume
that the brighter atoms are nitrogen, whereas the darker ones are
boron. Moreover, from the HRTEM, the B–N bond length is calculated
to be ∼1.45 A°, which matches well with the literature.47 Interestingly, the distance between two neighboring
white dots in Figure 1c is actually equal to the distance between any two nearest N or
B atoms. This corresponds to a d spacing of 0.22
nm, which matches well with the (hkl = 100) lattice
constant of BN too.42,48 The fast Fourier transform (FFT)
given in the inset of Figure 1b and the image in 1d reveals the typical sixfold symmetry
or the honeycomb nature of the hBN without any defects or dislocations
in the crystalline nature, despite the reduction in the thickness
and the size.

the corresponding FFT). (c, d) HRTEM images of exfoliated nanosheets.
(Red balls correspond to nitrogen atoms, and green balls correspond
to boron atoms.)

Another key technique
to identify the exfoliation and the film
thickness of the 2D materials is the atomic force microscopy (AFM).
An AFM image in the tapping mode that recorded the exfoliated nanosheets
drop-casted onto a mica sheet is given in Figure 2a. The height profile (Figure 2b) indicates that the approximate thickness
of the sheets varies around 0.85 nm, which is in close agreement with
the reported values for the monolayer BN.46,49,50

sheets in the tapping
mode. (b) Cross-section of exfoliated nanosheets.

For a material to be effectively screen printed, it should
be of
very high viscosity (>10 Pa s). Many of the polymeric materials,
such
as polyvinyl butyral, poly(methyl methacrylate), copolymer of poly(vinyl
acetate), etc., have been commonly used as a binder in the printing
technology to maintain the colloidal stability and also for the proper
adhesion of the ink onto the substrate.33,39,51 In this attempt, we have utilized PC as the binder,
which is a widely used polymer in many fields of electronic devices
possessing exciting properties such as a very high glass-transition
temperature of around 150 °C, easy solution processability, optical
transparency, and low cost. When the polymer solution is added into
the delaminated layered nanostructure in the solvent, the polymer
chains will get physically attached to the surface of the layered
material, and the steric hindrance induced by the macromolecules will
prevent further aggregation of the layered materials into clusters,
even when it is centrifuged. It is already known from the literature
that PC is capable of effective exfoliation of the bulk material through
a polymer-assisted delamination mechanism, and is ideal to stabilize
the nanosheets through steric hindrance.52 After centrifuging, the solution containing the delaminated nanosheets
with the polymer chains adsorbed on it will be like a highly viscous
paint. The viscosity of the colloid is tuned with the help of chloroform,
a low boiling point solvent, which can facilitate the room-temperature
drying of the ink and faster adhesion of the ink on the substrates.
This tricky selection of solvent enables a smooth printing on flexible
substrates like BoPET, as it does not need any pre- or post-printing
heat treatments. The photographic images of the printed film on the
BoPET substrate are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

The final ready-to-print ink
composition consists of about 83 mg/mL
of hBN nanosheets along with adsorbed polymer chains in chloroform.
The viscosity of the ink was studied using the rheological measurements.
Ideally, for a standard screen-printable ink, it should exhibit a
psuedoplastic behavior, that is, the viscosity should decrease with
increase in the shear rate.53 The overall
higher viscosity and psuedoplastic behavior will eventually help in
the high resolution of the printed patterns without any smudging at
the sides and edges. In our study, the ink showed a high viscosity
of 12 Pa s at a shear rate of 10 s–1, whereas the
viscosity reduced to less than 1 Pa s at higher shear rates (Figure 3a). This observed
shear-thinning behavior helped in the printing of high-resolution
patterns as the ink ceases to flow once the pressure applied on the
squeegee is removed. This immobilization is partly supplemented by
the high evaporation rate of the less volatile solvent used. The photographic
image given in the inset of Figure 3a clearly testifies the highly viscous nature of the
colloidal ink. The dynamic viscoelastic properties of the ink are
shown in Figure 3b.
It is observed that the loss modulus, which indicates the viscous
nature of the material, dominates over the storage modulus or the
solid-like behavior in the entire strain region. This viscous nature
helps in the effective printing of the ink with a good homogeneity
over a larger area.

ink. Inset
given is the photographic image of the highly viscous ink. (b) Variation
of the storage modulus and the loss modulus of the hBN ink with strain.

The surface morphology of the
printed pattern on the BoPET substrate
was visualized with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and AFM, which are given in Figure 4. The photographic image of the hBN ink screen-printed
on the Mylar film under optimal conditions is given in Figure 4a. The morphology of the printed
pattern at a lower magnification is shown Figure 4b. The printed hBN consists of stacked BN
layers, which is clear from Figure 4c. Almost all the sheets lie horizontally, whereas
very few lie randomly oriented to the plane of the substrate. This
can be due to the pressure applied on the squeegee while printing,
which helps the ink to strike down to the substrate surface effectively.32 Furthermore, during the free fall of the ink
onto the substrates, the delaminated BN sheets would prefer to assume
the low potential energy orientations, resulting in the horizontal
stacking of BN layers one on top of the other. This is more or less
like the stacking of 2D sheets, and this is the common morphology
exhibited by other 2D inks like graphene specifically in screen-printed
patterns.39 The horizontally levelled arrangement
of electrically insulating and thermally conducting BN sheets that
are connected to each other over a large surface area is supposed
to provide reliable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties
for the printed pattern. The thickness of the printed pattern is estimated
to be around 14 μm, which was computed using the scanning electron
micrographs recorded from the different portions of the printed thick
film (Figure 4d). The
obtained thickness is a result of three strokes of printing. The presence
of the polymer content is comparatively less in the ink formulation
(less than 20 wt %) and hence was almost invisible in the SEM images
but can be identified from the TGA discussed in the later section.

(b, c) Surface of the printed patterns in different magnifications.
(d) Cross-sectional image of printed hBN. (e, f) AFM images of the
surface of the printed hBN on the BoPET substrate.

AFM images given in Figure 4e,f also shed light on the surface morphology
of the printed
pattern, and they are quite similar to those obtained from the SEM
analysis. The nanosheets are arranged in a visibly close-packed manner.
The surface roughness of the printed pattern was also investigated
with the help of AFM analysis of the hBN ink screen-printed on the
BoPET substrate. The printed pattern possesses an average surface
roughness value of around 201 nm, and the root-mean-square surface
roughness is around 282 nm.

The thermal stability of the printed
pattern against peeling off,
cracking, etc. is a critical parameter in real electronic devices.
To understand the effect of heating in the printed patterns, we annealed
the samples at temperatures of 50, 100, and 150 °C for 1 h and
performed systematic SEM analysis of all the samples, which are depicted
in Figure 5. It is
evident from the images that all the samples have a similar morphology
in comparison to that of the samples printed and aged at room temperature,
without any visible cracks or peeling off from the flexible BoPET
substrate. This enhanced thermal stability is attributed to the high
thermal stability of hBN and also to the high thermal stability of
the polymer used for binding the nanosheets together and to the substrate.
The binder, PC, used in this study has a glass-transition temperature
of around 150 °C, and thus the annealing of the printed pattern
up to 150 °C will not cause any significant expansion or segmental
mobility of the polymer chains. Up to this temperature, the adhesion
of the ink to the BoPET was also found to be unaffected.

of the surface of the printed patterns annealed at (a)
room temperature, (b) 50 °C, (c) 100 °C, and (d) 150 °C
for 1 h.

The overall thermal stability
of the hBN ink was evaluated with
the help of the thermogravimetric analysis after drying a very small
portion of the ink before printing (see Figure S2). It is understood from the thermogram that the final composition
of the ink contained only around 15% of the polymer, and the remaining
was thermally stable hBN that resulted in an enhanced thermal stability
of above 400 °C for the hBN ink. The 10% weight loss temperature
of the final ink composition and that of the binder are given in Table S1. From the TGA analysis, it is understood
that there is an improvement of more than 100 °C in the thermal
stability of the newly developed ink when compared to that of the
pure polymer.

As shown in Figure 6, various electrical and dielectric properties of the
printed hBN
were investigated. The variation of the dielectric loss and dielectric
constant of the printed hBN on the copper foil with printed silver
as the top electrode is given in Figure 6a,b. It is clear that both these properties
decrease with increase in frequency. The “exponential-like”
decrease of the dielectric constant can be explained on the basis
of the various polarization mechanisms acting on the composite film
at the lower RF region. Up to a few tens of hertz, all the four polarization
mechanisms (interfacial, dipolar, ionic, and electronic) do contribute
to the net dielectric constant, with interfacial polarization being
the strongest as the otherwise porous printed film can contain a lot
of highly polarizable mobile charge carriers. These molecules respond
quickly to the applied frequency, resulting in a higher dielectric
constant at the lower end. As the frequency increases, the polarity
switching of these molecules fall behind that of dipolar polarization,
resulting in an obvious decrease of the dielectric constant. At these
frequencies, the polar nature of the B–N bond dictates the
dipolar polarization. The dielectric constant of the printed hBN is
found to be 2.57, and the dielectric loss obtained is 0.09 at 1 MHz.
The dielectric constant for the bulk hBN reported is between 2 and
4.54 The comparatively reduced value of
the dielectric constant for the printed hBN ink at 1 MHz can be attributed
to the ordered arrangement of a few layers of the 2D material combined
with the low dielectric constant of the polymer used. The capacitance
and the impedance values also reduce with respect to frequency (Figure 6c,d). All these properties
were measured for comparatively thicker printed layers of approximately
22 μm thickness.

(c)
capacitance, and (d) impedance of the printed hBN layer with respect

Microwave dielectric
characterizations of the delaminated low-dielectric-constant
structures are far more reliable than conventional RF characterizations
as the detrimental influence of interfacial and dipolar polarizations
damp out to ionic polarizations at the GHz frequency range. However,
there is a surprising scarcity of literature pertaining to the high-frequency
dielectric properties of 2D structures, believed to be primarily due
to the complexity and less popularity of the measurement techniques
involved. The dielectric properties of the printed BN ink were studied
for the first time in the microwave frequency region, with the help
of a split-post dielectric resonator (SPDR) at three different frequency
regions (5, 10, and 15 GHz) using BN printed on a flexible BoPET substrate
having a thickness of 17 μm. It should be noted that this thickness
of the film is slightly lower than that used in low-frequency measurements.
This should not be a problem because SPDR enables accurate microwave
dielectric measurement of thin dielectric films having high surface
resistance. Here, the BoPET film has been taken as the reference for
the resonant cavity, and the microwave dielectric constant of the
flexible substrate used is estimated to be 3. The dielectric properties
of the printed pattern were evaluated and are listed in Table 1. As expected, the apparent
dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the printed pattern are
slightly lower in the microwave frequency region when compared to
those in the RF region, obviously due to the decreased net polarization,
wherein the ionic polarization is the main component contributing
to the dielectric constant.55

The ac conductivity measured for the printed
film by making it
into a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitor is shown
in Figure 7a. As shown,
the ac conductivity increases with frequency, the lower values of
which evidence the high-insulation behavior of the printed exfoliated
hBN ink. The I–V characteristics
of the film printed on a copper foil are given in Figure 7b. The schematic of the experiment
is given in the inset of Figure 7b. It is observed that the current density increases
in an exponential manner after a particular applied field, which is
common in the case of many dielectrics.56,57 Moreover,
it is clear that the material possesses a comparatively lower leakage
current density. This is to be understood, considering the lamellar
arrangement of the exfoliated BN nanosheets between two high-voltage
electrodes, wherein electrons have to travel a longer path to drift
through the edges of the nanosheets in comparison with the nanoparticles.
In the latter case, leaking through the nanoparticle grain boundaries
is rather more facile. The DC conductivity of the printed hBN ink
at 100 V is around 2.5 × 10–6 A.

of ac conductivity with respect to frequency at the
RF region. (b) I–V characteristics
measured for the printed pattern.

The reliability of the dielectric properties of the printed
pattern
against folding of the samples and also after annealing is worth studying
for practical flexible electronics applications. To understand the
effect of bending on the dielectric properties, the printed film on
the flexible substrate was folded randomly in all the directions,
and the properties were analyzed at 15 GHz as given in Figure 8a. It is found that both dielectric
constant and dielectric loss remain more or less constant, within
the experimental error limit of the instrument used for the measurements,
even after folding up to 200 cycles. The effect of annealing on the
dielectric properties was also explored with the help of a SPDR by
heat-treating the samples at 50, 100, and 150 °C for 1 h, and
the results are given in Figure 8b. As the glass-transition temperature of the polymer
used is around 150 °C as mentioned elsewhere, we did not expect
much change in the dielectric properties, and the results are as expected.

printed film with respect to folding cycles (insets of (a) and (b)

Conclusions
The effective exfoliation
of the insulating hBN has been carried
out in DMF solvent and understood
with the help of various techniques. The morphological, thermal, and
electrical properties of the printed films offer an easy fabrication
process for a good dielectric layer for various electronic devices.
The lower dielectric constant of the printed film (2.57 at 1 MHz)
with promising low dielectric loss and the favorable capacitance can
make this material an effective substrate for various applications
including printed graphene-based electronics.

Experimental Section
Materials
Boron nitride powder of ∼1 μm
size was used as the starting material (Aldrich Chemicals Co). DMF
and chloroform were received from Merck Chemicals, India, whereas
the PC used in this study was received from DuPont. The substrates
used are commercially available biaxially oriented PET (Mylar) and
copper foil.

Ink Formulation
The exfoliation
of BN was done through
the liquid exfoliation method using DMF as the solvent. A concentration
of 2.5 mg/mL of the layered material was sonicated in an ultrasonic
bath for 48 h, so as to yield effective exfoliation. After 24 h of
sonication, the PC dissolved in DMF (20 wt %) was added to the same,
and the sonication was continued. After the exfoliation, the solution
containing the BN nanosheets was centrifuged first at a lower rpm
of 3000. The unexfoliated powder that settled down was discarded,
and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at a higher rpm
of 10 000. This BN nanopowder was used for screen printing
on the BoPET and the copper foil by adjusting the viscosity using
chloroform. The screen used was a silk screen with the desired pattern
fabricated by a photoresistive masking. A rubber squeegee was used
for the uniform spreading of the ink through the shadow mask onto
the substrate.

Characterization
The exfoliated
layered materials were
clearly imaged using TEM, and the lattice parameters were identified
using HRTEM (FEI Tecnai G2 30STWIN; FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). To
understand the delamination and to find out the thickness of the exfoliated
layers, AFM analysis in the tapping mode was carried out (Bruker Multimode,
Germany). The morphology of the printed patterns was viewed using
a scanning electron microscope (JEOL-JSM 5600 LV) and an atomic force
microscope (Bruker Multimode, Germany). The colloidal stability of
the ink with the polymer binder was measured at 15 °C using a
rheometer (Rheo plus32, Anton Par) provided with a chiller. The thermal
stability of the ink and the actual weight percentage of the binder
in the ink were investigated with the help of a thermogravimetric
analyzer TA Q50 under a nitrogen gas atmosphere at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min.

The high-frequency dielectric properties
of the printed patterns were measured with the help of a SPDR (QWED,
Warsaw, Poland) at 5, 10, and 15 GHz with the help of a vector network
analyzer (E5071C; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Here, the
BoPET film was used as the reference, and printed patterns of 3 cm
× 3 cm dimension on top of the BoPET were used as the sample
to wriggle out any possible error due to the presence of the substrate.
The electrical and dielectric properties at the RF range of 300 Hz
to 3 MHz were studied with the aid of an LCR meter (LCR HiTESTER,
Hioki 3532-50). For this, a MIM capacitor was fabricated by screen-printing
the insulating hBN ink on top of a conducting copper substrate. A
regular pattern of conducting silver was printed on top of the insulating
layer, which acted as the top electrode. The I–V characteristic of the printed film was measured using
a source meter (Keithley 2410; 1100 V source meter). For this, the
prepared ink was printed on a thin copper film, and Pt-metal was sputtered
on the top of the printed pattern as the top electrode.
