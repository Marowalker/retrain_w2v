We
have performed a density functional theory study of the MoS2 monolayer and the MoS2 (100) and (103) surfaces
in relation to the early stages of the hydrodesulfurization reaction.
In many X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, the (103) surface exhibits
a higher peak than the (100) surface, yet one of the most frequently
occurring surface has not been studied extensively. By analyzing experimental
studies, we conclude that the (103) surface of MoS2 is
the most frequently occurring edge surface when the sample size is
thicker than ∼10–15 nm. Herein, we report the first
comparison of reaction paths for the formation of a sulfur vacancy
on the (103) surface of MoS2, monolayer, and (100) surface
of MoS2. The reason for the occurence of the (103) surface
in the XRD patterns has been established. We point out the similarity
in the reaction barriers for the monolayer and (100) and (103) surfaces
and discuss the reason for it. Moreover, we found a more energetically
favorable step in the reaction pathway for the formation of a sulfur
vacancy, which allowed us to refine the previously established pathway.

Introduction
Layered transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been intensively
studied for decades and have an opportunity to be applied in nanoelectronics
and optoelectronics,1 photocatalysis,2,3 and as a transistor.4 Fuel purification
is among the most important applications of TMDs due to the demand
for cleaner fuel that rises each year within stricter environmental
regulations.5 Several approaches have been
tried to improve the processes of fuel purification such as changing
the morphology of the catalyst,6,7 doping,8 and novel supports.9,10 Nevertheless, the need
for developing highly effective catalysts still persists.

Sulfur
dioxide is an air pollutant; it affects human health11 and can provoke acid rains. One of the sources
of sulfur dioxide emission is fuel combustion. To reduce the emission
of sulfur dioxide, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) reaction is used, during
which sulfur is removed from refined petroleum products and natural
gas. The edge planes of MoS2 are used as a catalyst for
such a reaction. Morphologies of MoS2 nanoparticles in
hydrodesulfurization catalysis have been studied by scanning tunneling
microscopy, and the structures of catalytically active sites were
investigated.12 Several theoretical studies
have examined the elementary reaction steps, the catalytic activity
of the (100) surface of MoS2,13−16 cobalt promotion of MoS2 that increases the hydrogenation activity,17 and the effect of the hydrogen and sulfur coverage on MoS2 edges18,19 by means of density functional theory (DFT).
The latter studies have shown that sulfur vacancies can affect the
adsorption of sulfur compounds and improve the fuel purification process.
A promising study by Hu et al.20 showed
experimentally and theoretically that a stepped edge surface, which
consists of (100), (103), (110), and (200) planes of the MoS2 crystal, has significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity,
particularly in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

The band gap
of MoS2 varies from 1.23 eV in bulk21 up to 1.9 eV in a monolayer,22 which indicates a different chemical environment between
the two. It allows us to assume that catalytic efficiency can depend
on the structure of MoS2 and on the surface termination.
In applications, MoS2 is mostly used in the form of nanoparticles,1,23−25 suggesting that several surface orientations may
be of interest. The most studied MoS2 surface is (100)
(Figure 1). It is often
encountered in experiments, but several experimental studies showed
also the presence of the (103) edge surface of MoS2 in
samples,20,24−30 and in some of them, the (103) surface exhibits the highest peak
in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.24,26−28 In the case of (103), the surface area is ∼20%
larger than the area of the (100) surface consisting of the same number
of atoms, which can be useful for some HDS reactions, for example,
with large molecules. As per our knowledge, no one has investigated
the reaction pathway for the formation of a sulfur vacancy on the
(103) surface theoretically so far, even though it may have catalytic
efficiency distinct from those of the (100) surface and the monolayer.

and (103) surfaces of MoS2. Mo atoms are in turquoise
and S atoms in yellow.

In this article, our aim is to demonstrate the reason for
the occurrence
of the (103) surface of MoS2 in XRD patterns by DFT calculations.
We shall also shed light on the possible applications of the (103)
surface in the HDS reaction and on the difference in reaction barriers
between the monolayer and edge surfaces of MoS2 and propose
new reaction pathways. Moreover, we provide experimentalists with
information about similarities in the local structure of the examined
surfaces for sulfur coverage on an ideal MoS2 surface and
on the most stable sulfur coverage under HDS reactions.

Results and Discussion
Surface
Energies and Structures
Both the (100) and
(103) surfaces of MoS2 have been experimentally observed20,24−30 and have some of the highest peaks in XRD patterns among edge surfaces.
Other surfaces have also been observed, but due to the complexity
of calculation, we limit this study to two above-mentioned surfaces.

Previous theoretical investigations showed that during the HDS
reaction, sulfur coverage on the edge surface of MoS2 changes.18,19 The most stable sulfur coverage under HDS reactions is the so-called
Mo50-S50,19,31 where 50% of sulfur transfers from the S
edge to the Mo edge, or in other words, there is one sulfur atom per
Mo atom on the surface. The ideal MoS2 surface has two
sulfur atoms per Mo atom on the S edge surface and is called Mo0-S100.
In this study, we compare only the stability of Mo50-S50 and Mo0-S100
sulfur coverages for (100) and (103) surfaces by assuming that the
difference in surface energy between both surfaces is similar for
different sulfur coverages. A more recent study by Rosen et al.32 showed that the most stable coverage under HDS
was found to be Mo50-S100. We keep 50% of sulfur coverage on the S
edge because this work concentrates on the activity of the Mo edge,
and we expect that a change in the sulfur coverage on the S edge does
not have a big impact on the catalytic activity of the Mo edge due
to the large distance between the Mo and the S edges.

Cleavage
energy values showed a higher possibility of the formation
of the (103) surface (Table 1). The most energetically favorable surface was defined by
surface energy, which reflected the energy loss when creating the
surface, compared to the bulk. Relaxing the surfaces yielded only
minor changes in the atomic positions. The surfaces therefore mostly
retained a “bulklike” structure, which led to a small
decrease in surface energies for the relaxed surfaces. Effect of a
fixed bottom layer on the surface energies of both models was estimated
by relaxing models without atomic constraints. The energy decrease
caused by freeing all atoms is almost the same for both surfaces (−0.037
J/m2 for (100) and −0.031 J/m2 for the
(103) surface). Relaxing the surfaces without atomic constraints also
yielded only minor changes in the atomic positions.

Table 1 Cleavage and Surface Energies (J/m2)
 	cleavage
energy	surface energy (Mo0-S100)	surface energy (Mo50-S50)	
(100) surface	2.117	2.084	1.793	
(103) surface	1.853	1.827	1.561	
To examine
the surface energy of the most stable sulfur coverage
under HDS reactions by eq 1, half of the sulfur atoms have been transferred from the S edge
to the Mo edge. The obtained Mo50-S50 surfaces have significantly
lower surface energies, which is in agreement with previous results.19,31

On the basis of the computed surfaces, the (103) surface is
more
stable than the (100) surface both in the case of ideal surfaces and
in the case of the most stable sulfur coverage under HDS reactions.
Our result agrees with theoretical studies33 and experimental results, where the (103) XRD peak of MoS2 is the highest24,26−28 but contradicts
with refs (20, 29, 30), where the (100) peak is higher. Apparently, the
XRD peak intensity depends on the thickness of MoS2 samples.
The (103) peak is higher for the crystal size larger than ∼10–15
nm and smaller for thinner samples. It was verified by increasing
the ball-milling time in the work by Cheng et al.27

Formation of Sulfur Vacancy
The
key step in fuel purification
is the formation of a sulfur vacancy preceded by dissociative adsorption
of H2, diffusion of the hydrogen atoms on the MoS2 surface, creation of a H2S molecule, and subsequent associative
desorption.13,14

The lowest activation barrier
for H2 dissociative adsorption as well as the lowest activation
energies for H2S associative desorption was found on the
Mo edge with 50% sulfur coverage.14 Moreover,
for the (103) surface, the Mo edge with 50% sulfur coverage can be
created by a planar cut from the ideal structure33 along with other terminations (Figure S1). According to Paul and Payen,13 the energy of the departure of the first H2S molecule
from the Mo edge of the Mo50-S50 surface is lower (ΔE = 0.49 eV) than that from the S edge of Mo50-S50. A more
recent study by Prodhomme et al.14 showed
the same trend (ΔE = 0.92 eV). It allows us
to assume that most sulfur vacancies appear at the Mo edge and give
a reason to explore the formation of sulfur vacancies only on this
edge of the Mo50-S50 surface. In this section, we present energy pathways
for the elimination of the H2S molecule from the Mo edge
of the (100) monolayer, (100) surface, and (103) surface (Figure 2) and provide a slightly
altered pathway that is more energetically favorable.

Figure 2 Slab models of Mo50-S50
sulfur coverages: (a) monolayer, (b) (100)
surface, and (c) (103) surface. The local structures of Mo edges are
indicated by dashed ellipses.

The reaction pathway for the formation of sulfur vacancy
is presented
in Figure 3. The pathway
consists of the same steps as proposed by Prodhomme et al.14 To obtain consistent results for different surfaces
and simulate the case where the molecules and the slab are far from
each other, particular care should be taken. Energies for the first
reaction step (S1) and the last reaction step (S6) are taken as sums
of separate calculations of the molecules (H2 and H2S consequently) and the slab. Otherwise, the energy of the
systems slightly varies with the position of the H2 and
H2S molecules above the surfaces, which leads to disagreement
between results for different systems.

Figure 3 Reaction pathway for
the formation of a sulfur vacancy. Black,
green, and blue paths relate to the (100) monolayer, (100) surface,
and (103) surface, respectively. Paths are shifted vertically for
a better readability. The energies of the S1 state are taken as references
for each reaction path. Mo atoms are in turquoise, S atoms are in
yellow, and H atoms are in green and red (the two hydrogen atoms are
depicted with different colors for clarity). Geometrical structures
are depicted for the (100) monolayer surface.

We describe the pathway only for the (100) monolayer in detail
because the local structures of the Mo edge are the same for the (100)
monolayer, (100) surface, and (103) surface (Figure 2), and according to our results, the barriers
among the three models are similar (Figure 3). First, the energy barrier for dissociative
adsorption of H2 is 0.41 eV. The adsorption is found to
be an exothermic process (−0.16 eV). After the first step,
hydrogen atoms start to diffuse on the surface, beginning with transition
state 2 (TS2) where the hydrogen atom depicted as green goes to the
other side of the edge of the MoS2 layer (barrier is 0.58
eV). Further, the other hydrogen depicted as red diffuses to another
sulfur atom and stabilizes the system in comparison to S1 by −0.53
eV. The highest barrier of 0.86 eV should be overcome to break the
H–S bond of the red hydrogen atom and form a H2S
molecule adsorbed on the surface. The last step of H2S
desorption is an endothermic process and proceeds with almost no significant
barrier.

To further show that the chemical properties of S atoms
are not
affected by the overall structure of the surfaces and have the same
electronic structure on the Mo edges of the examined surfaces the
atom-projected p-orbital density of state of S atoms was calculated
(Figure 4). The peak
position near the Fermi level reflects the active state, whereas the
shift of the peak usually leads to a change in the binding strength.34,35 All sulfur atoms on the Mo edges have no noticeable difference in
the peak positions for all of the structures considered (the peak
positions are −0.74, −0.79, and −0.64 eV for
(103) and (100) surfaces and monolayer, respectively). The shape of
the p-states remains relatively unchanged across the Mo edges for
all systems. From this, we confirm that the overall structure of the
surfaces does not affect the chemical properties of the S atoms on
the Mo edges. Moreover, it was shown that the concentration of H2 affects the formation of a sulfur vacancy on the edge surface
of MoS2.14,36 We expect the same effect of
the concentration of H2 for the (103) surface by taking
into account the similar chemical activity of both surfaces.

Figure 4 Projected p-orbital
density of states of S for the Mo edge of the
monolayer, (100) surface, and (103) surface relative to the Fermi
level.

We provide a slightly altered
reaction pathway for the formation
of a sulfur vacancy, which is energetically more favorable (Figure 5). Here, the TS2
state was changed from the green hydrogen twisting from one side of
the layer to another different transition state labeled as TS2a where
the red hydrogen moves from a Mo to a S atom. The barrier for TS2a
is 0.28 eV lower than that for TS2. Likewise, the new S3a state is
0.27 eV more energetically favorable than S3. There are at least two
possible steps after S3a. In the first one, the green hydrogen goes
to another side of the edge of the MoS2 layer (TS3a) and
the rest of the pathway resembles the pathway in Figure 3. Another one skips the S4
state and goes from S3a to S5 (purple dashed line). The barrier of
TS3b is only 0.04 eV higher than that of TS4, which makes this pathway
possible under the working conditions of HDS but likely rarely occurring.
The last steps are the same as in Figure 3: the formation of the H2S molecule
adsorbed on the surface with the consequent desorption.

Figure 5 Reaction pathway
for the formation of a sulfur vacancy. The steps
for the proposed new pathway are depicted in red. The possible step
that skips S4 is in purple.

Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated that the
reason for the occurrence
of the (103) surface of MoS2 in XRD patterns is its low
surface energy and the possibility to construct the most energetically
favorable sulfur coverage by a planar cut.

Special attention
was paid to energy barriers on different MoS2 surfaces.
Our results for the Mo edge of the (100) monolayer
are very close to the results obtained in the work of Prodhomme et
al.14 Barriers among the (100) monolayer,
(100) surface, and (103) surface differ by less than 0.07 eV. By concluding
that the monolayer and (100) and (103) surface have similar catalytic
activities, it allows manufactures/experimentalists to use MoS2 catalysts equally well in the form of monolayers, samples
with the highest (100) peak in XRD patterns, as well as samples with
the highest (103) peak. The probable reason for such similarities
can be the weak van der Waals interaction between layers of MoS2, which can change the energy of the band gap but apparently
has a vanishingly small impact on the catalytic activity of the edge
surfaces of MoS2. Furthermore, we conclude that the barriers
for the reaction pathway for the formation of a sulfur vacancy on
(10X) surfaces (where, X = 0, 1,
2, etc.) should be the same because the local structure of the monolayer
on the surface is the same for all of these surfaces, only the empty
space between the layers of MoS2 as well as the surface
area grows with increasing X. If the bulk structure
of MoS2 is not needed for the HDS reaction, full exfoliation
of MoS2 can be beneficial because a monolayer standing
alone is able to adsorb bigger molecules than the bulk.

In addition,
a new reaction pathway for the formation of a sulfur
vacancy was found. It does not change the activation energy of the
reaction neither reduce the highest barrier of the reaction. The refined
pathway is more energetically favorable and provides a deeper understanding
of the reaction.

Computational Methods
DFT Calculations
Spin-polarized ab initio calculations
were performed with DFT, using the projector augmented wave method
as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).37,38 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional was used to
treat the electron exchange and correlations, together with the van
der Waals (DFT-D3) correction.39,40 The plane wave cut-off
energy was set to 350 eV. The convergence criterion was chosen so
that the maximum force on one atom is smaller than 0.02 eV/Å.
The calculations were performed with periodic boundary conditions.
The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Monkhorst–Pack k-point set containing 2 × 2 × 1 k-points during the structural optimization.41

Surface energy (Es) is calculated
as 1  where n is the number of
unit cells, A is the surface area, En is the total energy of the relaxed
model, and Eb is the total energy of crystalline
MoS2 (per unit cell). For cleavage energy calculation, En is the total energy of the
unrelaxed model.

During the search for transition states (TS),
two methods were
applied in the following order: first, climbing image nudged elastic
band42 and then the dimer method.43 For each TS, the dynamical matrix was calculated
and verified that it contains exactly one imaginary frequency.

Construction
of MoS2 Edge Surfaces
The (100)
and (103) surfaces of MoS2 were tested in depth and in
width until surface energy convergence of less than 0.01 J/m2 was reached. Final surfaces contain four unit cells in the x direction, five in the z direction for
surface energy calculations, and four in x and z directions for the calculation of the reaction paths (Figure 6), resulting in 40
Mo and 80 S atoms and 32 Mo and 64 S atoms, respectively. The vacuum
region in the z direction was set to 15 Å to
avoid mirror interactions between nearby images. During relaxation,
all atoms were allowed to relax except for the two bottom layers of
MoS2, which represent the bulk of MoS2.

Figure 6 Slab models
for the calculation of the reaction paths: (a) (100)
surface and (b) (103) surface.

The bulk unit cell of MoS2 consists of two layers:
Mo
atoms of one layer are exactly on top of S atoms of the second layer
and vice versa. Such structure leads to two types of edges: a Mo edge
with Mo atoms on top and a S edge wherein S atoms are on top (Figure 6). The (100) monolayer
is constructed from the Mo edge in a similar fashion as used in previous
models13−15 consisting of a single MoS2 layer separated
by 12 Å in the y direction. Two Mo layers in
the y direction are used to model the “as-cleaved
from the bulk” structure for the (100) and (103) surfaces of
MoS2. All slabs are carved in such a way that the upper
and lower termination will construct a bulk crystal if properly stacked
upon each other.
