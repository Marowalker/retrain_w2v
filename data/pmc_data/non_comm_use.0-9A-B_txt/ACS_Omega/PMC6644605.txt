Continuous
population growth and rapid urbanization will outpace
the global capacity of solid-waste disposal. Although pyrolysis, in
the waste management sector, has been regarded as a savior to bring
potential returns, it has struggled against high operation costs.
Here, we found that simple pyrolysis of properly mixed wastes [e.g.,
organic wastes (C) + metal wastes in the form of metal oxides (MxOy)] can bring
about the carbothermic reduction [C(s) + MxOy(s) → C′(s) + M(s) +
CO(g)] caused by the thermodynamic reducibility of metal oxide. This
process consequently produced not only nanoporous carbon powder usable
for energy storage devices but also nanoporous carbon fully decorated
with magnetic nanoparticles useful for magnetic applications. We believe
that the carbothermic reduction process, historically used for metal
refining, could be a promising alternative to resolve the long-pending
issues of the conventional pyrolysis approach as well as to produce
useful nanoporous carbon with ease. Our method could be a simple and
effective way to transform ubiquitous solid waste into useful resources
in the form of nanoporous carbon.

Introduction
Solid waste, a byproduct
of civilization, is any unwanted and unusable
substance which is discarded after primary use. In the past century,
as the world’s population has grown and become affluent, waste
production has increased 10-fold. It will double again by 2025.1 Even now, waste is being endlessly generated
faster than other environmental pollutants, including greenhouse gases,
and is escaping into the environment. Discarded materials have been
collected, some have been recycled or composted, and most have been
landfilled or incinerated with negligible energy recovery.2 Recently, in the waste management sector, pyrolysis
(the thermochemical decomposition of organic materials) is getting
great attention for its potential returns (“waste to fuel”).3−9 However, pyrolysis is complex and requires striking operation and
investment costs. Furthermore, produced gases and ashes contain high
heavy metal content, which are regarded as dangerous wastes.10 Hence, virtually, most of the wastes have been
eventually discarded by conventional incineration because of technical,
regulatory, reputational, and financial risks.10 Therefore, it is still highly demanding to make a breakthrough
to overcome technological and economical impediments faced by the
typical pyrolysis process. Herein, we demonstrate that the carbothermic
reduction process, typically used for extraction of metals from ores
in nature, could be a promising alternative to resolve the long-pending
issues of the conventional pyrolysis approach toward waste treatment.
We show that simple pyrolysis of properly mixed wastes [e.g., organic
wastes (C) + metal wastes in the form of metal oxides (MxOy)] can bring about
the carbothermic reduction [C(s) + MxOy(s) → C′(s) + M(s) + CO(g)]
caused by the thermodynamic reducibility of metal oxide reported by
Ellingham.11 This process was observed
to consequently produce nanoporous carbon powder with insufficient
yet but potentially increasable electrochemical performances or nanoporous
carbon fully decorated with superparamagnetic metal nanoparticles
certainly useful for high-value biomedical12,13 and environmental applications.14

Results
and Discussion
Coffee is one of the largest agricultural
products, which is mainly
used for beverages. According to the International Coffee Organization,
the total world’s coffee production in 2017 was 15 893
× 104 bags (60 kg/bag) and each year approximately
8 million metric tons of coffee is being produced globally.15 Recently, average coffee consumption in South
Korea has significantly grown at an annual rate of 7%. The amount
of coffee bean waste (CBW, i.e., the spent coffee grounds, the solid
residue remaining after brewing) has increased steadily. Most of the
CBW has been discarded with negligible regard for future use as a
solid waste, which is creating great disposal costs and waiting for
a proper way for waste treatment. For this reason, in this study,
we employed the ubiquitously existing coffee waste in South Korea.
As a source of metal oxide, we selected Fe2O3 for production of nanoporous carbon, taking into account the fact
that Fe2O3 is naturally occurring and omnipresent
rust.

Production of Nanoporous Carbon via Carbothermic Reduction
Historically, carbothermic reduction, one of the oldest metallurgical
processes, has been widely utilized to smelt various metals by removing
oxygen from metal oxides. With increasing industrial applications,
the mechanism of this reaction was a subject of numerous studies.
In particular, Ellingham constructed a diagram to predict the equilibrium
temperature between a metal, its oxides, and oxygen and to evaluate
the ease of the reduction of metal oxides.11 Typically, this involves heating the oxide together with carbon
as the reducing agent to drive off other elements such as gases and
slag and finally to leave pure metal [MO(s) + C(s) → M(s) +
CO(g)]. We paid special attention to this conventional chemical formula
and thought in a totally different way. We assumed that instead of
carbon, metal oxide can also be used as a sacrificial agent [i.e.,
C(s) + MO(s) → C′(s) + M(g or s) + CO(g)] in order to
activate carbon and at the same time produce pure metal once carbon
is not decomposed and metal oxide is fully reduced, finally evaporating
in a certain high temperature range.16,17 It was anticipated
that the reaction of metal oxide can create numerous pores on the
surface of carbon and finally produce nanoporous carbon fully decorated
with metal nanoparticles depending on the melting point of the metal
and processing temperature, so long as the adhesion between the metal
oxide and the carbon is strong enough. According to the literature,
the Fe2O3 in the mixture (c-CBW/Fe2O3) was thought to be reducible at a relatively low temperature
(∼900 °C) than other metal oxides [likely, C(s) + Fe2O3(s) → C′ + CO(g) + Fe(s), see Figure S1].18 Because
the melting temperature of Fe is around 1538 °C higher than our
processing temperature, it was expected that Fe in the form of nanoparticles
remains on the porosified carbon surface. On the basis of this scenario,
as depicted in Figure 1, first, we annealed the collected CBW for removal of inherent impurities
such as water, which led to carbonization (c-CBW). After mixing with
rust (c-CBW/Fe2O3), pyrolysis was carried out,
which resulted in nanoporous carbon particles fully decorated with
iron nanoparticles [porous carbon (PC)/Fe]. The iron particles were
able to be easily removed by washing with acidic solution, which resulted
in pure PC. The effect of the carbothermic reduction on the physical
and chemical properties of the CBW is quite notable, as can be recognized
from various analysis results (Figure 2).

Figure 1 Schematic showing the preparation procedure for multifunctional
nanoporous carbon powder. Using carbothermic reduction, we transformed
residential solid waste (CBW and rust) into another resource such
as nanoporous carbon with/without magnetic nanoparticles. In the practical
application of our method, the carbonization step, that is, CBW →
c-CBW, is not required. For the control experiment in this work, we
included the carbonization step. Therefore, mixing CBW with rust and
subsequent pyrolysis can lead to the same results. The figure at the
bottom shows real photographs of the produced materials.

Figure 2 Chemical and physical analysis. (a) TGA results. (b) Raman
spectra
showing changes in the relative intensity ratio of G to D bands (D/G
ratio). (c) XRD spectra showing crystal phase changes at each step
of the carbothermic reduction.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated that in the region
of
RT < T < ∼350 °C, water and other
impurities in the CBW are evaporated, thereby causing a significant
decrease in weight. The carbonization temperature was observed to
be less critical to the graphitic nature of the c-CBW, as long as
it is over ∼350 °C (Figure S2). The carbothermic reduction in c-CBW/Fe2O3 likely occurred at ∼850 °C in consideration of the slight
decrease in weight (Figure 2a). The Raman spectra (Figure 2b) exhibited two peaks at around 1320 and 1590 cm–1, which were assigned to the characteristic defective
D band and graphitic G band of carbon materials, respectively.19 The relative intensity ratio of D/G implies
the degree of structural disorder with respect to a perfect graphitic
structure. Taking into account the less noticeable alteration in D/G
ratio before and after carbothermic reduction, the reduction likely
did not cause any significant chemical changes except morphological
changes. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) results exhibited that the
Fe2O3 nanoparticles covering c-CBW are completely
reduced to Fe via carbothermic reduction according to our expectation,
as can be recognized from the spectra of c-CBW/Fe2O3 and PC/Fe (Figure 2c). Therefore, the solid-state etching of carbon by the carbothermic
reduction led to the alteration in the morphology of the c-CBW, as
can be noticed from Figure 3.

Figure 3 Morphology changes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show
the morphological changes of CBW at each step of our experiment. (a)
Carbonized CBW (c-CBW), (b) c-CBW mixed with iron oxide (c-CBW/Fe2O3), (c) porous carbon decorated with Fe particles
(PC/Fe) after carbothermic reduction of c-CBW/Fe2O3, and (d) porous carbon after removing Fe nanoparticles by
washing. It can be recognized that the surface becomes noticeably
porous after carbothermic reduction. See the text for details. The
initial annealing was observed to bring about less remarkable changes
in the morphology of the raw CBW powder. Thus, the morphological differences
between CBW and carbonized CBW (c-CBW) were less recognizable (a).
The rigorous mixing with iron oxide powder with a particle size of
few tens of nanometers [c-CBW/Fe2O3 with a weight
ratio of 4(Fe2O3):1(CBW)] resulted in a serious
change in color (from black to red) and nearly uniform coating (b).
The annealing of the mixture c-CBW/Fe2O3 at
a temperature of ∼900 °C led to significant morphological
changes, likely because of the phase transformation of Fe2O3 that occurred during carbothermic reduction (c). The
resulting porous carbon decorated with Fe particles (PC/Fe) was thinner
and rougher than the CBW. After removing Fe nanoparticles by washing,
the PC became even more porous (d). Regarding the elemental change
and distribution of the rust (Fe2O3) and iron
particles, further studies were performed using TEM and edx.

Elemental Analysis and
Microstructure
The initial annealing
was observed to bring about less remarkable changes in the morphology
of the raw CBW powder. Thus, the morphological differences between
CBW and carbonized CBW (c-CBW) were less recognizable (Figure 3a). The rigorous mixing with
iron oxide powder with a particle size of few tens of nanometers [c-CBW/Fe2O3 with a weight ratio of 4(Fe2O3):1(CBW)] resulted in a serious change in color (from black
to red) and nearly uniform coating (Figure 3b). The annealing of the mixture c-CBW/Fe2O3 at a temperature of ∼900 °C led
to significant morphological changes, likely because of the phase
transformation of Fe2O3 that occurred during
carbothermic reduction (Figure 3c). The resulting PC decorated with Fe particles (PC/Fe) was
thinner and rougher than the CBW. After removing Fe nanoparticles
by washing, the PC became even more porous (Figure 3d). Regarding the elemental change and distribution
of the rust (Fe2O3) and iron particles, further
studies were performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (edx).

As confirmed
already by the XRD results, the TEM image and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) of the c-CBW did not show any crystallinity (Figure 4a) and main components
were observed to be carbon and oxygen. However, the mixture of c-CBW/Fe2O3 showed the existence of polycrystalline Fe2O3 particles with a size of few tens of nanometers
(Figure 4b). The interplanar
spacing of the Fe2O3(012) plane was measured
to be ∼0.37 nm, which well corresponded with the previous XRD
result (Figure 2c).
After the carbothermic reduction, the Fe2O3 particles
were observed to be fully reduced to small Fe particles, which uniformly
decorated the amorphous PC matrix (Figure 4c). Some impurities (such as Ca), likely
included during sample preparation, were also detected from edx. The
interplanar spacing of the Fe(110) plane was measured to be ∼0.2
nm, which was also well matched up with the XRD result. After etching
of PC/Fe with 1 M HCl, most of the Fe and other impurities were nearly
removed and only the PC matrix with the amorphous phase remained (Figure 4d).

after rinsing with HCl solution (PC).

Magnetic Properties of Nanoporous Carbon
In order to
address realizable applications of our new resources obtained from
residential detritus (CBWs and rust), we gauged the magnetic properties
and electrochemical performances. First, in order to verify the magnetic
properties of c-CBW/Fe2O3 and PC/Fe, vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM) measurements were performed at room temperature. Figure 5 shows the field-dependent
magnetization (M–H) curves
of the c-CBW/Fe2O3 and PC/Fe powders together
with real photographs showing response to a permanent magnet. The
saturation magnetization (MS), remanent
magnetization (MR), squareness ratio (MR/MS), and coercivity
(HC) values of the c-CBW/Fe2O3 particles were measured to be 3.23 A m2/kg,
0.54 A m2/kg, 0.16, and 23.1 mT, respectively. In contrast,
the porous carbon decorated with nanosized Fe particles (PC/Fe) displayed
soft ferromagnetic behavior with MS of
177.2 A m2/kg, MR of 7.8 A
m2/kg, and HC of 3.3 mT. It
has been reported that the MR value of
the bulk iron is around 218 A m2/kg at room temperature.20 Considering the report that the ferromagnetism
undergoes development from atom to bulk as the size is increased,21,22 it was a natural result that the MS of
PC/Fe is lower than that of bulk iron. Magnetic nanoparticles, thanks
to size effects, such as high surface-to-volume ratio and different
crystal structures, have been reported to exhibit interesting and
considerably different magnetic properties than those found in their
corresponding bulk materials.20 Therefore,
many types of magnetic nanoparticles, including iron oxides (e.g.,
Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O323), pure metal (e.g., Fe24 and Co25), and alloys (e.g.,
CoPt326 and FePt27), have been synthesized using coprecipitation,
thermal decomposition, microemulsion, hydrothermal synthesis, etc.28 Magnetic nanoparticles with proper stability
have attracted great attention of environmental and biomedical application
areas.29−32 Taking into account that metallic magnetic materials such as iron,
cobalt, and nickel are toxic and susceptible to oxidation, our porous
carbon decorated with iron nanoparticles is likely less suitable for
biomedical applications. However, encapsulation and stabilization
are thought to be easily achievable by further processing. It is thought
that without further processing, the PC/Fe could be directly used
in a specific applications area such as magnetic recording/storage
media.33

kinds of powder and magnification of hysteresis.

Electrochemical Performances of Nanoporous Carbon
In
order to address the realizable application of our PC prepared by
rinsing PC/Fe with 1 M HCl, the electrochemical performance was evaluated.
Numerous efforts have been put toward the utilization of the various
biowastes in the energy storage sector.34 It has been already reported that the CBWs can be employed as the
precursor in fabricating supercapacitor electrodes.35−42 In our case, we compared electrochemical performances between c-CBW
prepared by simple annealing and PC prepared by carbothermic reduction.
Because the surface area, evaluated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method, of the PC (252.11 m2/g) was higher than that
of c-CBW (59.75 m2/g), the electrochemical performance
also showed differences. Figure 6 presents the cyclic voltammetry (CV) (current–voltage)
profiles of a supercapacitor fabricated by c-CBW and PC at different
potential scan rates. Both showed imperfectly rectangular CV features
with a gradual change of current density with electrode polarity change.
This indicated that the supercapacitor has a high internal cell resistance.
The CV pattern was observed to be more resistive at higher scan rates.
This type of CV profile has been typically observed in activated carbon
materials produced by other synthesis methods.43 In the CD (charge–discharge) profiles of both electrodes,
the c-CBW was observed to have a lower CD time than the PC. The specific
capacitance calculated from the discharge time of the c-CBW electrode
was found to be quite low (7 F/g). In contrast, the PC electrode showed
nearly a 4-fold increase in capacitance (27 F/g). In the case of cyclic
stability (Figure 6c), the PC was maintained over 5000 cycles, whereas the c-CBW was
poor. The remaining impurities such as sulfur (edx data in Figure 4a) are thought to
seriously degrade the stability, likely because of the redox reaction
(S + 2H2SO4 → 3SO2 + 2H2O). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results
(Figure 6d) indicated
that the PC has a slightly lower equivalent series resistance and
interface resistance than the c-CBW. Although the capacitance of the
PC electrode is much lower than the values reported in the literature,35−42 it is thought that it could be surely improved via further processing
or rigorous optimization.

Conclusions
In this study, we showed that the carbothermic
reduction process
using thermodynamic reducibility of metal oxide, typically used for
metal refining, could be a simple and effective way to transform ubiquitous
solid waste into a useful resource in the form of nanoporous carbon.
As an example, using CBW and Fe2O3(rust), we
produced nanoporous carbon fully decorated with magnetic nanoparticles
and nanoporous carbon powder with a high surface area. Further optimization
and slight modification of our process could greatly increase the
material selectivity. Namely, proper combinations of carbon-based
wastes and metal oxides could produce new types of resources in the
form of nanomaterials, thereby likely settling economical hot potato
of the conventional pyrolysis approach toward waste treatment. We
hope that our method is considered as one of the ways for waste recycling
using nanoscience.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Nanoporous
Carbon
CBW was collected
from the coffee machine installed in the library of Korea Institute
of Machinery & Materials (KIMM). The collected waste was dried
in an oven at 120 °C for around 24 h long. After drying, the
CBW was first annealed in a quartz tube furnace under the conditions
of ∼0.1 Torr and ∼800 °C for around 1 h under an
Ar flow of 300 sccm. Then, the carbonized CBW (c-CBW) was mixed with
Fe2O3. The mixing ratio between c-CBW and Fe2O3 was 1:4 by weight (c-CBW/Fe2O3). Using a planetary ball mill (BM-5L BALL-MILL, POONG LIN
Co., Ltd.), the mixture was pulverized for around 12 h long at a speed
of 180 rpm. Aluminum oxide balls with a diameter of 15 mm and a 250
cm3 Teflon container were used for the ball mill. Then,
the mixture (c-CBW/Fe2O3) was once more annealed
in a quartz tube furnace under the conditions of ∼0.1 Torr
and ∼900 °C for around 1 h under an Ar flow of 300 sccm.
Finally, porous carbon fully decorated with iron particles (PC/Fe)
was obtained. For removing Fe particles and other impurities, first
of all, 1 M HCl solution was prepared, in which PC/Fe powders were
immersed. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h. Then, the
mixture was filtered using a filter paper in order to obtain PC powder.
Subsequently, the PC powder was rinsed using distilled water. These
filtering/rinsing processes were repeated three times (Figure S3).

Preparation of an Electrode
Cell
Electrodes were prepared
by mixing 80 wt % activated carbon, 10 wt % carbon black, and 10 wt
% polytetrafluoroethylene, with a small amount of ethanol. Each sample
was fabricated into a sheet using a roll press machine. The sheet
was cut into a rectangular piece of 1 × 1 cm2 followed
by heating in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The sheet was immersed
in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution for impregnation
into the pores of electrodes. After impregnation, a symmetric test
cell (HS cell, Welcos Corp.) was assembled to investigate the electrochemical
performances of aqueous supercapacitors, and a filter paper was used
as a separator. The separator was sandwiched between the two electrodes
in a test cell.

Characterizations
A field emission scanning electron
microscope (JSM-7000F, JEOL) was used to analyze the surface morphology.
edx was used for element analysis. XRD (Empyrean, PANalytical) was
used to analyze the crystallinity of the samples. Raman spectroscopy
measurements were conducted by a spectrometer (inVia Raman microscope,
Renishaw) equipped with a 514 nm laser line and an objective lens
(×50). TGA was conducted by TGA/DSC 1 (Mettler-Toledo instrument)
at a scan rate of 10 °C/min. Specific surface areas were measured
by N2 adsorption BET (Micromeritics Tristar 3000). The
TEM images were obtained using a high-resolution TEM instrument (TEM-ARM200F,
JEOL) at 200 kV. The field-dependent magnetization (M–H) curves were measured using a VSM (Lakeshore,
7400 series). The electrochemical performances were measured with
an electrochemical workstation (CHI 600E, CH instruments) with a two-electrode
setup. CV and galvanostatic CD measurements were conducted. CV curves
were obtained at 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mV/s with
a voltage window of 1 V. Galvanostatic current was cycled at 0.5,
1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 A/g with the same voltage window. The specific
capacitance CSP was calculated from the
CD measurements using the equation CSP = 2I/[m(dV/dt)], where I is the current, m is the mass of the active material in a single electrode, and dV/dt represents the slope of the discharge
curve in CD measurements.
