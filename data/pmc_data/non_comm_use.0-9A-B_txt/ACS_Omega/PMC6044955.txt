α-Conotoxins preferentially
antagonize muscle and neuronal
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Native α-conotoxins
have two disulfide links, CI–CIII and
CII–CIV, and owing to the inherent properties
of disulfide bonds, α-conotoxins have been systematically engineered
to improve their chemical and biological properties. In this study,
we explored the possibility of simplifying the disulfide framework
of α-conotoxins Vc1.1, BuIA, ImI, and AuIB, by introducing [C2H,C8F]
modification to the CI–CIII bond. We
therefore explored the possibility of using hydrophobic packing of
standard amino acid side chains to replace disulfide bonds as an alternative
strategy to nonnatural amino acid cross-links. The impact of CI–CIII disulfide bond replacement on the
conformation of the α-conotoxins was investigated using molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance chemical
shift index study. Two-electrode voltage clamp techniques and MD simulations
were used to study the impact of disulfide bond deletion on the activities
of the peptides at human neuronal nAChRs. All disulfide-deleted variants
except ImI[C2H,C8F] had reduced potency for inhibiting nAChRs. Our
results suggest that the CI–CIII disulfide
bond is important to stabilize the secondary structure of α-conotoxins
as well as their interaction with neuronal nAChR targets. Results
from this study enrich our understanding of the function of the CI–CIII disulfide bond and are useful in guiding
future structural engineering of the α-conotoxins.

Introduction
α-Conotoxins
from the marine snail genus Conus are
inhibitors of muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs).1−3 The majority of native α-conotoxins have two
internal disulfide cross-links between cysteines CI and
CIII and CII and CIV. The number
of residues between CII and CIII (m) and CIII and CIV (n) define
different types of α-conotoxins, which are noted as m/n (Figure 1).1−3

of their disulfide-deleted analogues. (A) Vc1.1, (B) BuIA, (C) ImI,
and (D) AuIB are small disulfide-rich (yellow) peptides belonging
to the 4/7, 4/4, 4/3, and 4/6 α-conotoxin subfamilies, respectively.
The CI–CIII disulfide bond of the α-conotoxins
is deleted by replacing the Cys residues with His at position 2 and
Phe at position 8. *m and n indicate
the number of residues between CII–CIII and CIII–CIV disulfide bonds, respectively.

Three α-conotoxins, Vc1.1,
RgIA, and AuIB, have been shown
to have a potent, long-lasting analgesic effect in rat models of chronic
neuropathic and visceral pain.4−8 Although these α-conotoxins preferentially antagonize neuronal
nAChRs, with RgIA and Vc1.1 targeting the α9α10 nAChR
subtype4 and AuIB inhibiting the α3β4
nAChR subtype,9 the involvement of these
nAChRs in pain transmission pathways remains unclear.10 These three conotoxins also potently inhibit high-voltage-activated
(HVA; N- and R-type) calcium channels via the G-protein-coupled γ-aminobutyric
acid B receptor (GABABR) in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons,
providing another explanation to their analgesic properties.5,6 To date, Vc1.1 and AuIB have been reported to target the GABABR, whereas the activity of BuIA and ImI at GABABR is yet to be investigated. All four α-conotoxins Vc1.1, BuIA,
ImI, and AuIB antagonize different nAChR subtypes, and therefore in
the present study, the activity of the four conopeptides was evaluated
on the neuronal nAChRs.

Despite their pharmacological potential,
the application of conotoxins
has been hindered by their short biological half-life, intrinsic disulfide
bond shuffling, susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, poor absorption,
and limited oral availability.11 Consequently,
these conotoxins have been subjected to chemical modifications to
improve the efficacy of synthesis and biological properties.12

Although the disulfide bridges are pivotal
in stabilizing the structure
of conotoxins, they are inherently unstable under reducing environments.
Disulfide bond shuffling in conotoxins can result in heterogeneous
peptide conformations, therefore increasing the production cost and
concurrently lowering the peptide synthesis efficiency. Additionally,
compounds with alternative disulfide connectivity typically have altered
biochemical properties.13,14 One strategy to prevent
disulfide bond shuffling of α-conotoxins is to replace one or
both CI–CIII and CII–CIV disulfide bonds with nonnatural amino acid cross-links,
such as lactam bridges,15 selenocysteines,16 dicarba bridges,17,18 cystathionine
bridges,19 or dithiol amino acids.20 Replacement of disulfide bridges of α-conotoxins
by lactam or dicarba bridges resulted in altered conformations and
between 20- and 60-fold decreased activity or binding at nAChRs.15,17,18 Other strategies relying on selenocysteines,
cystathionines, or dithiol amino acids had less impact on the structure,
and the resulting compounds had similar or improved activity.16,19,20 Despite these successes, nonnatural
amino acids are not optimal for the development of α-conotoxins
as drugs because they cannot be produced recombinantly and they increase
the cost of synthetic production. We have recently shown that an alternative
strategy is to replace disulfide bonds with tight-binding standard
amino acids, forming a hydrophobic mini-core.21 We showed that the [C2H,C8F] modification to the CI–CIII bond of the cyclic conotoxin Vc1.1 (cVc1.1) resulted in
a nearly identical conformation and a decreased activity of more than
twofold at α9α10 nAChR,21 contrasting
with the complete loss of activity displayed by the dicarba replacement
of the same disulfide bond.18 Therefore,
[C2H,C8F] modification to the CI–CIII bond could be an efficient strategy to simplify the structure of
the cyclic conotoxins. Then, a question arises regarding the feasibility
of the application of [C2H,C8F] modification to the CI–CIII bond of the native α-conotoxins.

In this study,
we investigated (i) the structure of 4/7(m/n)-Vc1.1, 4/4-BuIA, 4/3-ImI, and 4/6-AuIB
disulfide-deleted [C2H,C8F] analogues, in which cysteine residues
at positions 2 and 8 of the peptides are substituted with histidine
and phenylalanine residues, respectively (Figure 1), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation;
(ii) the potency of Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] analogue at human (h)α9α10
and hα3β2 nAChRs, BuIA[C2H,C8F] at hα3β2 and
hα3β4 nAChRs, ImI[C2H,C8F] at hα7 and hα9α10
nAChRs, and AuIB[C2H,C8F] at hα3β4 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes; and (iii) the molecular docking
models of the above [C2H,C8F] conotoxin analogues at their respective
human nAChRs.

Results and Discussion
Structural Impact of the
Replacement of Disulfide Bond CI–CIII
The backbone conformation
of the [C2H,C8F] conotoxin variants remained similar to that of their
parent peptide during MD simulation, but some transient instabilities
were observed. The backbone conformation of both Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] and
Vc1.1 was very stable during MD simulations, with the backbone root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) values ranging from 0.5 to 1 Å (Figure 2A), suggesting that the mutant
and wild-type peptides might have similar backbone conformation (Figure 2B,C). The backbone
conformation of AuIB appeared to be also stable, with rmsd values
ranging between 0.25 and 0.75 Å (Figure 2J). The substitution of both AuIB C2 and
C8 resulted in a deviation of less than 1 Å for ∼70% of
the simulation, with short-lived metastable conformations characterized
by 1.7 Å rmsd from the parent peptide appearing twice during
the 100 ns simulation. This suggests a probably more critical role
of the CI–CIII disulfide bond in stabilizing
the structure of AuIB than that of Vc1.1.

of the Hα chemical shift deviation from the wild-type peptide
are used to evaluate the mutational effect on the peptide secondary
structure.

Short-lived metastable conformations
were also observed in the
simulations of BuIA, with 80% of explored conformations being less
than 1 Å rmsd from the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution
structure, and two short-lived periods where the conformation was
∼1.2 Å rmsd (Figure 2D). The simulation of BuIA suggests that the fold of
some α-conotoxins might be unstable in water, which is not completely
surprising because most peptides of similar size are disordered in
solution. The [C2H,C8F] substitution destabilized the fold of BuIA
in the first 40 ns, as evidenced by the unstable rmsd values. These
values were nevertheless below 1.5 Å and then stabilized at around
0.75 Å for nearly 50 ns, suggesting that the conformation at
that time could be as stable as the conformation of BuIA. The range
of conformations explored during the simulation remained similar to
those of the parent peptide (Figure 2E,F).

The MD simulation of ImI was not stable,
with two apparent metastable
conformations characterized by rmsd values of 0.5 and 1.0 Å (Figure 2G). Similar to the
other three peptides, the replacement of the first cysteine resulted
in some destabilization, which can be seen in the greater fluctuation
of the rmsd of the variant compared to the parent peptide. The panel
of conformations adopted by ImI[C2H,C8F] was <1 Å rmsd for
70% of the simulation, and the range of conformations was globally
similar to those observed during ImI MD simulation (Figure 2H,I).

MD simulations
of the wild-type and variant conotoxins indicated
that the removal of the disulfide bond formed between Cys2 and Cys8
might result in no conformational change for Vc1.1 and ImI, whereas
modest impact could be observed for AuIB and BuIA, with 0.2 and 0.3
Å rmsd change, respectively.

For all peptides apart from
Vc1.1, the removal of the disulfide
conformation was inferred to result in destabilization of the native
fold, with more frequent exploration of alternative conformations.
The smallest peptide without a disulfide bond displaying a defined
fold in solution is Trp cage, which has 20 amino acid residues.22 The α-conotoxins studied here are noticeably
smaller (12 and 15 residues), and their conformational stability despite
their small size is attributed to their two disulfide bond cross-links.
It is therefore remarkable that the present MD simulations suggest
that some of these variants with only one disulfide bond could still
display a defined fold.

Structural differences between conotoxins
are contributed by their
individual sequence of amino acids and more importantly their innate
disulfide frameworks. In comparison to Vc1.1, AuIB, and BuIA, ImI
has the shortest n loop and consequently the shortest
helix. This decreased secondary structure content resulted in a lower
stability of ImI compared to the other three peptides, as evidenced
by the fluctuations of rmsd. The lower stability of ImI can also be
attributed to the presence of only one proline residue, whereas Vc1.1,
AuIB, and BuIA have 2, 3, and 2 proline residues, respectively. Proline
residues have a fixed φ backbone dihedral angle, and they therefore
contribute to decreased peptide flexibility. Taken together, ImI has
the least rigid peptide backbone compared to Vc1.1, AuIB, and BuIA.

The Hα secondary chemical shifts of Vc1.1 and its disulfide-deleted
analogue are nearly identical, with a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.91, demonstrating that the two peptides
have similar structures (Figure 3A). NMR spectrometry data thus supported the results
from MD simulations regarding the conformational stability and similarity
of Vc1.1 and Vc1.1[C2H,C8F]. By contrast, the removal of the disulfide
bridge greatly affected the structure of BuIA (R2 = 0.23), with significant Hα secondary chemical shift
deviation from the wild-type peptide in the first half portion and
also in the C-terminal tail of the peptide (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the secondary shifts indicate
an increased α-helical content in the second half of the peptide
of disulfide-deleted BuIA. For ImI, minimal Hα secondary chemical
shift deviation (R2 = 0.73) was observed
between the wild-type and disulfide-deleted peptides (Figure 3C), indicating that their structures
are similar, as predicted by the MD simulations. For AuIB, the Hα
secondary chemical shifts for positions 6, 7, 8, and 10 deviate between
the wild-type and the disulfide-deleted variant by 0.5 ppm, suggesting
a small change of conformation (Figure 3D). The Hα secondary chemical shifts from positions
11 to 15 are more negative for the variant, suggesting a helical structure.
The deletion of the CI–CIII disulfide
bond of BuIA and AuIB resulted in higher rmsd values during MD simulations
and supported by NMR spectroscopy analysis, which indicated that their
C-terminus has an increased helical content compared to the parent
peptides.

Vc1.1, BuIA, ImI, and AuIB (black line) and their disulfide-deleted
analogues (red line). The correlation coefficients (R2 score) for (A) Vc1.1 vs Vc1.1[C2H,C8F], (B) BuIA vs
BuIA[C2H,C8F], (C) ImI vs ImI[C2H,C8F], and (D) AuIB vs AuIB[C2H,C8F]
are 0.91, 0.23, 0.73, and 0.55, respectively.

Only Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] showed an overall Hα secondary
chemical
shift R2 value of more than 0.9, suggesting
that the removal of the Cys residues at positions 2 and 8 essentially
maintains the peptide secondary structure. The secondary structures
of BuIA, ImI, and AuIB, however, are highly dependent on the cysteine
bond between residues Cys2 and Cys8. Previously, we have demonstrated
the involvement of introduced residues, His2 in electrostatic interaction
and Phe8 in the formation of the peptide hydrophobic core, both important
in stabilizing the secondary structure of cVc1.1[C2H,C8F].21 Thus, here we assumed that the varying stability
between Vc1.1[C2H,C8F], ImI[C2H,C8F], and AuIB[C2H,C8F] is primarily
due to their sequence differences.

The backbone root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF) of the wild-type
peptide and its disulfide-deleted analogues was calculated to evaluate
their stability in solution (Figure S1).
Removal of the disulfide bond resulted in significant backbone fluctuation
for the first four residues of Vc1.1[C2H,C8F], whereas the RMSF for
residues between 5 and 16 is similar between Vc1.1 and its disulfide-deleted
analogue. Interestingly, the backbone RMSF of BuIA is comparable to
that of BuIA[C2H,C8F], despite their large structural conformational
difference. In contrast to BuIA, the RMSF for AuIB[C2H,C8F] is substantially
larger than that of the wild-type. The backbone RMSF for both the
N- and C-termini of ImI[C2H,C8F] is larger than that of the wild-type
for positions 1–3 and 10–12.

Impaired Inhibitory Effect
of Disulfide-Deleted α-Conotoxin
Analogues at Human nAChRs
Removal of the CI–CIII disulfide bond of Vc1.1, BuIA, and AuIB (10 μM) substantially
reduced the ability of the peptides to inhibit acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked
currents of their respective human nAChR targets expressed in X. laevis oocytes (see Figure 4).

disulfide-deleted
analogues (10 μM) at human nAChR subtypes. Superimposed representative
ACh-evoked currents recorded from X. laevis oocytes expressing hα9α10 (A,E), hα3β2 (B,C),

trace) and presence (red trace) of 10 μM Vc1.1 and Vc1.1[C2H,C8F]
(A,B), BuIA and BuIA[C2H,C8F] (C,D), ImI and ImI[C2H,C8F] (E,F), and
AuIB and AuIB[C2H,C8F] (G).

Despite the high degree of secondary structural similarity
between
Vc1.1 and Vc1.1[C2H,C8F], inhibition of hα9α10 nAChR by
the [C2H,C8F] mutant was detected only at 30 μM, with negligible
activity at 1 and 10 μM (Figure 5A). Similarly, there was minimal inhibition of hα3β2
nAChR by 1 and 10 μM Vc1.1[C2H,C8F], and substantial inhibition
was only observed at 30 μM (Figure 5B). By contrast, wild-type Vc1.1 is a potent
inhibitor of hα9α10 and hα3β2 nAChRs, with
complete inhibition observed at 10 μM. Previously engineered
[C2H,C8F] mutant of cVc1.1 was reported to retain the structural integrity
of the wild-type counterpart but with only twofold loss of potency
at inhibiting hα9α10 nAChR.21 In this study, we show dramatic loss of Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] activity
at hα9α10 nAChR, although it is structurally similar to
Vc1.1, suggesting that the CI–CIII disulfide
bond may be directly involved in the interaction between the peptide
and the nAChR. Arguably, the difference in potency between the cyclized
and linear [C2H,C8F] mutants could be due to the presence of the short
linker, joining the N- and C-termini of the cyclized peptide. The
linker was originally introduced as a scaffold to stabilize the three-dimensional
structure of cVc1.1, and it may have inadvertently compensated the
loss of cVc1.1[C2H,C8F] potency.

and their disulfide-deleted analogues. The bar graph of the relative

in the presence of 1, 10, and 30 μM Vc1.1 and Vc1.1[C2H,C8F]
(A,B), BuIA and BuIA[C2H,C8F] (C,D), ImI and ImI[C2H,C8F] (E,F), and
AuIB and AuIB[C2H,C8F] (G). Whole-cell currents mediated by hα9α10
and hα3β2 nAChRs were activated by 6 μM ACh, whereas
those mediated by hα7 and hα3β4 were activated by
100 and 300 μM ACh, respectively. Data expressed as mean ±
SEM, n = 5 to 16 (unpaired Student’s t-test; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.0001 vs the relative current amplitude of 1.0).

Disulfide deletion of BuIA similarly resulted in
a significant
loss of potency at hα3β2 and hα3β4 nAChRs
(Figure 5C,D). For
both human nAChR subtypes, 1 μM BuIA inhibited >90% of the
ACh-evoked
current amplitude compared to ∼70% at 30 μM BuIA[C2H,C8F].
AuIB[C2H,C8F] exhibited no activity at hα3β4 nAChR, with
no inhibition of the ACh-evoked current amplitude in the presence
of 30 μM AuIB[C2H,C8F] (Figure 5G).

The potency of ImI[C2H,C8F] at inhibiting
ACh-evoked currents mediated
by hα9α10 and hα7 nAChRs was also reduced, albeit
to a lesser extent compared to the [C2H,C8F] mutants of Vc1.1, BuIA,
and AuIB. Compared to ImI, ImI[C2H,C8F] remains largely active at
inhibiting both human nAChR subtypes (Figure 5E,F), which is consistent with the observed
subtle secondary structural change between the two peptides. Although
the conformational shift of ImI[C2H,C8F] is larger (R2 = 0.73) than that of Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] (R2 = 0.91), the mutant ImI peptide retains comparable potency
to ImI at 10 and 30 μM peptide concentrations tested, in inhibiting
hα9α10 and hα7 nAChRs. By contrast, only 30 μM
Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] had discernible inhibitory activity at both nAChRs.
The concentration-dependent activity of ImI and ImI[C2H,C8F] at the
hα7 nAChR subtype was determined, giving a half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of 497 ± 32 nM (as reported previously)23 and 9.59 ± 0.62 μM, respectively
(Figure S2).

Despite α-conotoxin
disulfide-deleted analogues of Vc1.1,
ImI, and AuIB being structurally similar to their wild-type counterparts,
functional screening of their potency at human nAChRs revealed contradicting
results. AuIB[C2H,C8F] did not inhibit hα3β4 nAChR (up
to 30 μM), whereas [C2H,C8F] analogues of Vc1.1 and BuIA have
significantly reduced potency at human nAChR subtypes. By contrast,
relatively minimal impact on the activity of ImI[C2H,C8F] at hα9α10
and hα7 nAChRs was observed.

In another study, oxidation
of the first disulfide bond of ImI
was identified as more important for binding than that of the second
disulfide bond.24 A more recent study reported
that downsized α-conotoxins having only the first loop cyclized
by the CI–CIII disulfide bond were still
active at nAChRs. By contrast, cyclization of the second loop using
the CII–CIV disulfide bond resulted in
inactive conotoxins.25 More generally,
most attempts at replacing only the first disulfide bond using nonnatural
cross-linking residues resulted in a significant decrease in activity.15,17,18 An alternative strategy for simplifying
the structure of α-conotoxins with minimal impact on activity
could therefore be the substitution of the second disulfide bond,
which could be achieved using the methodology presented here.

Binding
Mode of α-Conotoxins and Their [C2H,C8F] Mutants
at Human nAChR Principal Subunit C-Loop
MD simulations on
models of the α-conotoxin–nAChR complex were performed
to gain a better understanding on the interaction between the peptides
and their target human nAChRs. The binding pocket for α-conotoxins
at nAChRs is formed at the extracellular interface between adjacent
principal (+) α subunit and complementary (−) α/β
subunit. Specifically, (+) subunit loops A–C and loops D–F
of the (−) subunit contribute to α-conotoxin recognition
by nAChRs.

Our generated docking models revealed that for all
four wild-type α-conotoxins (Figure 6A,D,G,J), the CI–CIII disulfide bond is buried in the binding site and formed
direct contact with the disulfide bond formed between residues Cys192
and Cys193 of the (+) subunit C-loop. By contrast, less interaction
was observed between the [C2H,C8F] mutants and the nAChRs, resulting
in larger movement of the C-loop (Figure 6C,F,I,L). The opening of the hα9α10
nAChR C-loop bound with Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] and the opening of the hα3β4
nAChR C-loop bound with AuIB[C2H,C8F] were significantly right shifted
to a comparable extent of ∼3 Å. The C-loop opening of
the AuIB[C2H,C8F]-bound hα3β4 nAChR was the most right
shifted, resulting in increased solvent exposure of the peptide and
consequently substantial loss of potency at inhibiting the nAChR.
By contrast, the opening of the hα3β2 nAChR C-loop-bound
BuIA[C2H,C8F] and the opening of the α7 nAChR C-loop-bound ImI[C2H,C8F]
were only slightly right shifted.

The weaker binding of
Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] and AuIB[C2H,C8F] to their
nAChR targets mainly resulted from the solvent-semiexposed side chain
of the introduced His2 residue and the bulky benzyl side chain of
the Phe8 residue. As a result, Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] and AuIB[C2H,C8F] have
fewer contacts with the tip of the C-loop, which could be a contributing
factor to their reduced potency at inhibiting their target nAChRs
despite their minor secondary structure perturbation. The loss of
Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] potency can also be attributed to the absence of hydrogen
bond between peptide His12 and hα9α10 nAChR Glu195 residues
because of the increased opening of the C-loop. In addition, the loss
of AuIB[C2H,C8F] potency can also be attributed to the dramatic increase
in backbone fluctuation, decrease in backbone stability as well as
conformational change in the bound state.

On the other hand,
the minor conformational change for the C-loop
of hα3β2 nAChR/BuIA[C2H,C8F] and the C-loop of hα7
nAChR/ImI[C2H,C8F] might explain their relatively smaller decrease
in activity than that of Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] and AuIB[C2H,C8F]. Loss of
BuIA[C2H,C8F] activity at human nAChRs can be attributed to the large
local conformational perturbation from BuIA, as evident from MD simulations
and Hα chemical shift analysis. Although the secondary structure
of BuIA[C2H,C8F] was most affected, the peptide still retained some
activity at inhibiting hα3β2 and hα3β4 nAChRs.
The relatively smaller loss of activity for BuIA[C2H,C8F] might originate
from the smaller conformational perturbation to the C-loop and the
comparable backbone RMSF to the wild-type. In contrast to BuIA[C2H,C8F],
the secondary structure of ImI[C2H,C8F] is similar to that of ImI
in both unbound and bound states; therefore, the CI–CIII disulfide bond can be postulated to have a minor influence
on the structure and inhibitory activity of ImI at hα9α10
and hα7 nAChRs.

Additionally, the bound-state rmsd of
Vc1.1, BuIA, ImI, and AuIB
and their disulfide-deleted analogues was calculated to qualitatively
evaluate the influence of the conformational change to their nAChR
binding (Figure S3). In the bound state,
the backbone rmsd for Vc1.1[C2H,C8F] and ImI[C2H,C8F] is similar to
that of the wild-type, whereas the rmsd for BuIA[C2H,C8F] and AuIB[C2H,C8F]
is substantially larger compared to that of the wild-type. Overall,
these results are consistent with MD simulations of the unbound state.

In summary, our results demonstrate that the CI–CIII bond of the α-conotoxins regardless of their cysteine
framework classification has a critical role of not only in stabilizing
their secondary structure and maintaining their stability but also
in their binding to multiple human nAChRs. Most importantly, we provide
evidence to support the fact that this disulfide bond is not just
a redundant feature but has been selectively conserved within the
α-conotoxins as a structural scaffold for them to be biologically
active.

Methods
Homology Modeling
Models of Vc1.1/Vc1.1[C2H,C8F]-bound
human α9α10 nAChRs, ImI/ImI[C2H,C8F]-bound human α9α10
and α7 nAChRs, BuIA/BuIA[C2H,C8F]-bound human α3β4
nAChRs and α3β2 nAChRs, and AuIB/AuIB[C2H,C8F]-bound human
α3β4 nAChRs were built using Modeller (version 9v12),
as described previously.26 The sequences
of human α1, α3, α4, α6, α7, α9,
α10, β2, β3, and β4 nAChR subunits were retrieved
from the UniProt database.27 The crystal
structures of Aplysia californica AChBP
(ACh binding protein) in complex with α-conotoxin PnIA[A10L,D14K]
(PDB code 2BR8)28 and the extracellular domains of mouse
α1 (PDB code 2QC1)29 and human α9 (PDB code 4D01)30 nAChR subunits were used as templates to build 200 models
of each α-conotoxin/nAChR complexes. Models with the lowest
discrete optimized protein energy score31 were selected for further structural refinement using MD simulations.

MD Simulations of α-Conotoxins
The designs of
α-conotoxins Vc1.1, BuIA, ImI, and AuIB tested in this study
are summarized in Figure 1. Their structures were modeled by substituting the corresponding
residues in the structure of α-conotoxins (Vc1.1 PDB code 2H8S,32 BuIA PDB code 2I28,33 ImI PDB code 2C9T,34 and AuIB PDB code 1MXN(35)) using Modeller (version
9v12).36,37

The protonation states of α-conotoxin
His, Asp, and Glu residues were predicted using the PropKa 3.1 method.38 The models and the first NMR structure were
minimized and refined using MD simulations performed with the Amber
14 package and ff14SB force field.39,40 The peptides
were solvated in a truncated octahedral TIP3P water box containing
∼3000 water molecules. Sodium ions were added to neutralize
the systems. The systems were first minimized with 3000 steps of steepest
descent and then 3000 steps of conjugate gradient with the solute
restrained to their position by a harmonic force of 100 kcal/mol·Å2. A second minimization was then performed but with all position
restraints withdrawn. The systems were then gradually heated up from
50 to 300 K in the NVT ensemble over 100 ps with the solute restrained
to their position using a 5 kcal/mol·Å2 harmonic
force potential. The MD simulations were then carried out in the NPT
ensemble, and the position restraints were gradually removed over
100 ps. The production runs were conducted over 100 ns simulation
time with pressure coupling set at 1 atm and a constant temperature
of 300 K. The MD simulations used a time step of 2 fs, and all bonds
involving hydrogen atoms were maintained to their standard length
using the SHAKE algorithm.41 The particle
mesh Ewald method was used to model long-range electrostatic interactions.42 MD trajectories were analyzed using visual molecular
dynamics,43 and molecules were drawn using
PyMol (Schrödinger, LLC). Procedures and parameters set up
are the same for the MD simulation of the α-conotoxin-bound
nAChRs.

α-Conotoxin Synthesis
All α-conotoxins
used in this study were assembled on the Rink amide methylbenzhydrylamine
resin using solid-phase peptide synthesis with a neutralization/2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate
activation procedure for Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)
chemistry as described previously.44 Cleavage
was achieved by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid,
phenol, water, and triisopropylsilane as scavengers in the ratio of
88:5:5:2, at room temperature (20–25 °C) for 2 h. Trifluoroacetic
acid was evaporated at low pressure in a rotary evaporator. Peptides
were precipitated with ice-cold ether, filtered, dissolved in 50%
buffer A/B (buffer A consists of 99.95% H2O/0.05% trifluoroacetic
acid and buffer B consists of 90% CH3CN/10% H2O/0.045% trifluoroacetic acid), and lyophilized. Crude peptides were
purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) on a Phenomenex C18 column using a gradient of
0–100% methanol for 80 min, with the eluent monitored at 214/280
nm. Electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed the molecular mass of
the peptides before they were pooled and lyophilized for oxidation.
The cysteines in the peptides were oxidized in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 (pH 8–8.5) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL,
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 h. Owing to
its poor solubility in water, the reduced ImI[C2H,C8F] peptide was
dissolved in 20% CH3CN/80% H2O prior to adding
NH4HCO3. The oxidized peptides were then purified
by RP-HPLC using a gradient of 0–40% buffer B over 40 min.
Analytical RP-HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to
confirm the purity and molecular mass of the synthesized peptides.

NMR Study of α-Conotoxin Mutants
NMR spectra
of the mutants were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer.
Samples were dissolved in 90% H2O/10% D2O at
pH 4.25 at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Total correction spectroscopy
(TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) data
were collected at 290 K. The Hα chemical shifts were assigned
by analyzing the TOCSY and NOESY spectra using CcpNmr software.45

In Vitro cRNA Synthesis
Plasmid
pMXT construct of the
human α7 nAChR subunit was linearized with BamHI, and plasmid pT7TS constructs of human α3, α9, α10,
β2, and β4 nAChR subunits were linearized with XbaI restriction enzymes (NEB, Ipswich, MA) for in vitro
cRNA transcription using SP6 (hα7) and T7 (hα3, α9,
α10, β2, and β4) mMessage mMachine transcription
kits (AMBION, Foster City, CA).

Oocyte Preparation and
Microinjection
All procedures
were approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee.
Stage V–VI oocytes were obtained from X. laevis, defolliculated with 1.5 mg/mL collagenase type II (Worthington
Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) at room temperature for 1–2
h in OR-2 solution containing (in mM) 82.5 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES at pH 7.4. The oocytes were injected with 5
ng cRNA for hα3β2, hα3β4, and hα7 nAChRs
or 35 ng cRNA for hα9α10 nAChR (concentration confirmed
spectrophotometrically and by gel electrophoresis) using glass pipettes
pulled from glass capillaries (3-000-203 GX, Drummond Scientific Co.,
Broomall, PA). The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in sterile
ND96 solution composed of (in mM) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES at pH 7.4, supplemented with 5%
FBS, 50 mg/L gentamicin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY), and 10 000
U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY).

Oocyte
Two-Electrode Voltage Clamp Recording and Data Analysis
Electrophysiological
recordings were carried out 2–5 days
post-cRNA microinjection. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings of X. laevis oocytes expressing human nAChRs were performed
at room temperature (21–24 °C) using a GeneClamp 500B
amplifier and pCLAMP9 software interface (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA) at a holding potential of −80 mV. Voltage-recording and
current-injecting electrodes were pulled from GC150T-7.5 borosilicate
glass (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and filled with 3 M KCl,
giving resistances of 0.3–1 MΩ.

The oocytes were
perfused with ND96 solution using a continuous Legato 270 push/pull
syringe pump perfusion system (KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) at a
rate of 2 mL/min. For oocytes expressing hα9α10 nAChRs,
50 nL of 50 mM BAPTA was injected using a glass pipette 1 h before
recording and perfused with ND115 solution containing (in mM) 115
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, and 10 HEPES at pH 7.4. Owing
to the Ca2+ permeability of hα9α10 nAChRs,
BAPTA injection was carried out to prevent the activation of endogenous
calcium-activated chloride channels in X. laevis oocytes.

Initially, oocytes were briefly washed with bath
solution (ND96
or ND115) followed by three applications of ACh at half-maximal excitatory
concentration (EC50) of 6 μM for hα9α10
and hα3β2, 100 μM for hα7, and 300 μM
for hα3β4 nAChRs. The oocytes were washed with bath solution
for 3 min between ACh applications. The oocytes were incubated with
peptides for 5 min with the perfusion system turned off, followed
by coapplication of ACh and peptide with flowing bath solution. All
peptide solutions were prepared in ND96/ND115 + 0.1% bovine serum
albumin. Peak current amplitudes before (ACh alone) and after (ACh
+ peptide) peptide incubation were measured using Clampfit software
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) where the ratio of ACh + peptide-evoked
current amplitude to ACh alone-evoked current amplitude was used to
assess the activity of the peptides at human nAChRs. All electrophysiological
data were pooled (n = 5 to 16) and represent mean
± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data sets were compared using
an unpaired Student’s t-test. Differences
were regarded statistically significant when p <
0.05. The IC50 was determined from the concentration–response
curve fitted to a nonlinear regression function and reported with
error of the fit. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
