We
report the fabrication and characterization of visible and near-infrared-resistive
photodetector using horizontally aligned titanium tri sulfide (TiS3) nanoribbons. The fabrication process employed micro-electromechanical
system, photolithography and dielectrophoretic (DEP) methods. The
interdigitated electrodes (IDE) fingers were fabricated using photolithography
and thin-film metallization techniques onto the Si/SiO2 substrate, and then TiS3 nanoribbons were horizontally
aligned in between IDE using DEP. The fabricated device was first
characterized in absence of light and then, the photodetector-based
characteristics were obtained by illuminating it with fiber-coupled
laser beam. These characteristics were optimized by varying wavelength
and power density of the laser beam. The present photodetector shows
a maximum responsivity of 5.22 × 102 A/W, quantum
efficiency of 6.08 × 102, and detectivity of 1.69
× 109 Jones. The switching times, i.e., response and
recovery times were found to be 1.53 and 0.74 s, respectively, with
1064 nm wavelength and 3.4 mW/mm2 power density of the
laser beam. Also, the effect of O2 adsorption on nanoribbons
has been studied and it is found that adsorbed O2 acts
as electron acceptor and decreases the conductivity of the photodetector.
Experimentally, it is found that the photoresponse of the horizontally
aligned TiS3 nanoribbons is better than that of a randomly
oriented TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector. Finally,
the performance of the present photodetector was compared to that
of the previous ones that were found to outperform the reported ones.
The additional advantages of the photodetector include excellent stability
and portability from which it may be concluded that TiS3 nanoribbons can be a promising candidate for application in nanoscale
electronic and optoelectronic devices.

1 Introduction
Over
the last decade, nanostructured materials have attracted attention
from the research and industrial community due to their extremely
interesting properties and applications in areas such as sensing technology,
medical diagnostics, catalysis, drug delivery systems, bioprocessing,
optoelectronic devices, etc. One of the prominent optoelectronic devices
may be photodetectors. Various nanostructured materials have emerged
as efficient visible as well as near-infrared (NIR) photodetectors
with improved sensitivity, photoresponse, stability, etc. The reason
being the nanostructured materials provide quantum, optical confinement
effects and large surface areas, which lead to a higher extent of
light absorption, which in turn gives a better detection capability.1−5 Published results support the development of a photodetector using
one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured materials as a wonderful tool
to enhance the performance of optoelectronic devices.6−10 Moreover, size and shape of the nanostructured materials can be
tailored in terms of nanosheets, nanotubes, nanobelts, nanoribbons,
etc. concerning a better detection capability.11−20 This assembly of nanostructured materials is found to be quite advantageous
in enhancing the performance of a device in several prospects. The
highly ordered nanostructure-based photodetectors displayed significant
enhancement in device performance in comparison with the pristine
film.12 Recently, photodetectors based
on two-dimensional (2D) materials with vertical structures, like V-HfS2,17 V-MoS2/Si,16 V-SnS2,15 and V-MoS2,19 have been reported,
which exhibit excellent photoresponse and high photosensitivity. Also,
many UV detectors with enhanced performance have been reported, like
UV–visible photodetectors based on integrated Se/n-Si p–n
heterojunctions,11 large-area ZnS nanobelt-based
UV-light sensor with enhanced photocurrent and stability,13 self-powered UV photodetector based on a crossed
ZnO nanofiber array homojunction.20 All
of these factors cumulate in a way so as to enhance the performance
and activity of a photodetector. At the same time, a 1D material-based
device overcomes some limitations, such as the effect of dark current,
interference of the surrounding parameters, and the requirement for
complicated and sophisticated purification/fabrication procedures.
In view of the aforementioned discussion, one-dimensional (1D) materials
hold great promise in the avenue of the photodetector and thus are
an active and useful area of research.

Among various layered
materials, black phosphorous, graphene, dichalcogenides
(MoS2, WS2, etc.) and trichalcogenides (TiS3, TaS3, NbS3, NbSe3, etc.)
possess weak out-of-plane bonding between layers, which allows the
exfoliation of their bulk down to a single layer using simple exfoliation
techniques.21−29 Among these, TiS3 have established an extremely important
place in future electronics and optoelectronic devices. TiS3 possesses modest band gap; higher carrier mobility; and better anisotropic,
electronic, and optical properties, as well as it is found to be a
chemically stable material; therefore, TiS3 can be a suitable
candidate for optoelectronic devices.30−39 At the same time, nanostructures of TiS3 can be easily
integrated with conventional silicon/germanium materials as well as
with the optical technologies for their fabrication protocols. On
comparing quasi 1D nanostructures of TiS3 with its higher
dimensions, it is observed that this nanostructure material offers
a combination of high electric-field tunability and large surface
area, which is very beneficial in fabricating complex devices such
as detectors and sensors. Apart from TiS3, the most common
member of the layered family is graphene, which has been considered
as most promising candidate for the development of optical devices
and is also used in semiconductor industries, the reason being their
higher carrier mobility. But at the same time, the applications of
graphene in electronic and optoelectronic devices are limited due
to the absence of an electronic band gap. This limitation becomes
very prominent where controllable operations are required.40−48 Contrary to this, the properties of TiS3 are such that
it can be efficiently be used in the fabrication of optical devices.49−51 TiS3 possesses a robust direct band gap of approximately
1 eV, high optical responsivity, and also relatively higher in-plane
electron mobility. In addition to this, the TiS3 monolayer
possesses strong anisotropies in electrical and optical properties,
which is very useful in fabricating next-generation electronic devices,
like high-mobility transistors. The general methods for fabrication
of trichalcogenides are chemical vapor transport (CVT) and sulfurization
of their bulk material. The product obtained using these methods is
in the form of layers formed of quasi 1D whiskers and nanosheets or
nanoribbons.52,53 At low growth temperatures such
as 400 °C, TiS3 shows a morphology of flowerlike nanostructures
and nanosheets. At higher growth temperatures, TiS3 grows
in the form of nanoribbons. A report has been found on the isolation
and exfoliation of the bulk TiS3 material obtained at varying
growth temperatures. They reported that TiS3 nanosheets
that have been grown at slightly lower temperature, show higher electron
mobility (≈73 cm2/V s) whereas the TiS3 nanoribbons have lower mobilities but show a superior electric field
and optical tenability.9,54−57 This is due to the differences
in the electronic properties of the TiS3 samples grown
at lower temperature and at higher temperatures, which is obtained
by density functional theory calculations. This work constitutes a
significant step in exploring trichalcogenide (TiS3) in
electronic applications such as detectors wherein large surface area
is required.

There are various materials and methods already
reported to fabricate
and characterize efficient and inexpensive photodetectors. Some of
the reported methods include the use of multilayer WS2,58 multilayer InSe,59 graphene,60 multilayer GaSe,61 microstructured Si,62 In2Se3 nanosheet,63 monolayer MoS2, GaTe Flakes,65 ZnO nanowires,66 etc. for efficient and sensitive photodetectors.
Although the reported materials and methods provide a good photoresponse,
these materials and methods also suffer from several limitations.
These limitations include complicated fabrication procedures, usage
of large quantities of chemicals and reagents, prolonged duration
of the analysis, requirement of skilled personnel and equipments,
and moreover, the involvement of an ultrahigh-sensitive lab. Thus,
the objective of a simple, fast, accurate, sensitive, and cost-effective
methodology for fabrication and characterization of photodetectors
that work both in visible and NIR regions of the electromagnetic spectrum
remains unattained. The present study illustrates an efficient strategy
to achieve these aims.

In this work, we describe a horizontally
aligned TiS3 nanoribbon-based visible and NIR photodetector
on the Si/SiO2 substrate. First of all, TiS3 nanoribbons was
prepared using chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. Before fabricating
the detector, the structural and morphological properties of the TiS3 nanoribbons were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD),
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) characterization
techniques. Then, for the fabrication of the detector, TiS3 nanoribbons were horizontally aligned in between titanium/gold interdigitated
electrodes (IDE) on Si/SiO2 substrate using dielectrophoresis
(DEP) method. Finally, in the fabricated device, photodetector-based
characteristics were obtained by collimating it with a fiber-coupled
laser beam of varying wavelength and power density. The output photoresponse,
responsivity, (Rλ), detectivity
(D), and quantum efficiency (QE) of the photodetector were determined
using the experimental characteristics of the photodetector. The response
time and recovery time of the fabricated photodetector were also evaluated.
Finally, the performance of the present photodetector was compared
to that of the reported ones.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation of TiS3 Nanoribbons
TiS3 nanoribbons were synthesized by a solid-gas reaction
between titanium powder (2 g, good fellow, 99.5% purity) and sulfur
gas produced by heating of sulfur powder (6 g, Merck, 99.9% purity).
This reaction was carried out in a vacuum-sealed ampoule, and vacuum
is used to remove impurities, such as atmospheric oxygen and water,
and also prevent oxidation of titanium during heating. Prior to this
reaction, first Ti disks were etched in an acidic mixture of hydrofluoric
acid and HNO3 (4:30 wt %), which cleans the surface of
Ti disks and removes any oxide impurities. Ampoules were then heated
at a rate of 250 °C per h and kept at 500 °C for 20 h (temperature
and time of sulfuration have been previously optimized) in a horizontal
furnace. After approximately 20 h of growth process, the ampoule is
cooled in ambient condition; TiS3 nanoribbons were then
obtained from the ampoule. The structural, morphological, compositional,
as well as optical properties of the fabricated samples were examined
by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field-emission scanning electron microscopy
( FESEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), High resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and UV−Vis spectroscopy
techniques.

2.2 Fabrication of a Horizontally
Aligned TiS3 Nanoribbon-Based Detector
For the
fabrication of
a TiS3 nanoribbon-based detector, an appropriate amount
of TiS3 nanoribbons were suspended in ethanol, followed
by sonication for 30 min. The oxidized Si wafer substrate having a
SiO2 top layer (300 nm) is used as a substrate. Then, to
fabricate the metallic electrodes, Ti/Au (8:100 nm) was deposited
on both ends of the Si/SiO2 substrate using standard photolithography
and liftoff process. Again, in between Ti/Au interdigitated electrodes,
the suspension of TiS3 nanoribbons was dropped and by application
of alternating current (AC) voltage, the suspended TiS3 nanoribbons got aligned in between interdigitated electrodes. This
horizontal alignment of TiS3 nanoribbons in between (Ti/Au)
interdigitated electrodes can be understood by the well-known “dielectrophoresis”
(DEP) technique.67 In the typical DEP technique,
a nonuniform electric field is applied to the suspension of TiS3 nanoribbons, which results in the polarization of suspended
particles within the corresponding solvent. There will be some gradients
in the electric field that force the alignment of the TiS3 particles (dipoles) with the local field lines and push these particles
toward regions with the most intense fields. In the initial studies,
DEP has been extensively used to assemble carbon nanotubes68 or graphene69−71 between metallic electrodes;
later, its use to align the 2D and 1D nanostructures has been explored.72

In our implementation of the DEP technique
to align the TiS3 nanoribbons, we have assembled an experimental
set up as shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, Ti/Au interdigitated electrodes (IDE) were grown on a Si/SiO2 substrate and an AC voltage has been applied between Ti/Au
IDE. The AC voltage is a 1 MHz sinusoidal signal of 10 V peak-to-peak,
and the electrodes are separated by a 5 μm distance. A drop
of the colloidal suspension of TiS3 nanoribbons is dropped
in between the electrodes as soon as the electric field is generated
by the oscillating voltage. This electric field polarizes the TiS3 nanoribbons with respect to the solvent. The gradients in
the electric fields in between the TiS3 nanoribbons and
the corresponding solvents push the TiS3 nanoribbons toward
the region of the highest electric-field intensity. This can be better
understood using a DEP force acting on tubelike particles and is given
by the following equations73 1   2  where εm* and εp* are the complex permittivities
of the suspension solvent
and the suspended particle, respectively, E is the
applied electric field, and fCM is the
Clausius–Mossotti factor that depends on the complex permittivities
of the suspension solvent and the suspended particle. If the suspended
particle has a polarizability higher than that of the medium, i.e.,
|εp*| > |εm*|, the force will
push
the particle into the region of higher electric-field intensity and
vice versa.

Figure 1 Sketch of the DEP technique to horizontally align TiS3 nanoribbons in between the Ti/Au interdigitated electrode onto the
Si/SiO2 substrate.

In the present suspension of TiS3 nanoribbons,
as a
result of DEP force, TiS3 nanoribbons get pushed into the
region of higher electric field. The TiS3 nanoribbons get
deposited bridging the electrodes because near to the electrodes,
the electric-field intensity was found to be the highest. This method
is found to be very beneficial in the fabrication of fully packed
TiS3 channels using a suspension of an even low concentration
of TiS3 nanoribbons.

2.3 Implementation
of a TiS3 Nanoribbon-Based
Photodetector
In the fabricated TiS3 nanoribbon-based
device, for photodetector-based characterization, the device was illuminated
with a fiber-coupled laser light of varying wavelengths and power
density. The spectral responses of the photodetector characteristics
were recorded at different wavelengths and power of the laser beam.
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated photodetector were measured by
Keithley SCS4200 (Keithley Instruments Inc.).

3 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of the TiS3 nanoribbons
obtained using smartlab Rikagu with Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54 Å) in θ–2θ configurations is shown
in Figure 2a. Deposits
formed using monoclinic TiS3 as a unique crystalline phase
can be well identified using the XRD diffraction pattern in Figure 2a. The XRD pattern
is found to be consistent with JC-PDS-ICDD 15-0783.49 All diffraction peaks are found to be narrow, which confirms
that the material is well crystallized. Lattice parameters (a, b, c, α, β,
γ, and V) determined from XRD patterns are
listed in Table 1,
which are found to be comparable with the reported ones.49 Therefore, it is confirmed that pure TiS3 nanoribbons have been formed using our fabrication method
discussed in the Experimental Section.

From the optical transmission spectra of the fabricated TiS3 nanoribbons, its band gap can be measured using Tauc’s
relationship. According to theoretical and practical results, TiS3 exhibits direct interband transitions and with photon energy
(hν), it is found to obey the given relation 3  where hν is photon
energy, α is the absorption coefficient, A is
a constant, and Eg is the band gap.

From eq 3, it is worth
mentioning that by plotting (αhν)2 against photon energy hν, the band
gap value of TiS3 can be determined by extrapolating the
straight line portion at α = 0, as shown in Figure 2b. In this figure, the variation
of (αhν)2 values as a function
of energy of the incident radiation has been depicted. The band gap
energy (Eg) of TiS3 was obtained
by extrapolation method. It may be noticeable from the figure that
on extrapolating the straight line portion of (αhν)2, the curve meets the x axis
(energy) at 1.1 eV, which is considered as the optical band gap of
TiS3.

Once the formation of TiS3 was confirmed,
the morphology
of the TiS3 nanoribbons was also examined from a scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image. The suspension of the prepared TiS3 sample is shown in Figure 2c. In the SEM image shown in Figure 2d, 1D ribbonlike structures are clearly revealed.
Then, the dimension, structure, and orientation of the TiS3 nanoribbons has been confirmed using the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images shown in Figure 2e. TEM images confirm that the formation of TiS3 nanoribbons has been obtained with lengths of several tens of micrometers
with smooth surfaces. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shown
in Figure 2e and 2f depicts the uniform nanoribbon-like structures
and clear lattice fringes of TiS3. It shows that the fringe
spacing of the TiS3 nanoribbons is found to be 0.43. The
corresponding d value [101] of the monoclinic structure
has been obtained using the selected electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
given in Figure 2g.
SAED patterns also reveal that the fabricated TiS3 nanoribbons
were single crystal in nature. Further, the energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) spectrum given in Figure 2h reconfirms the formation of TiS3 and separate
peaks of Ti and S have been clearly noticed. EDS spectrum clearly
depicts that the product composition is close to the stoichiometric
composition of TiS3 (Ti/S = 25.81:70.19 ≈ 1:3).
In this way, using all of these characterization techniques, the formation
of pure TiS3 nanoribbons with well-known dimensions and
composition has been confirmed.

Further, we have characterized
the fabricated horizontally aligned
TiS3 nanoribbon-based detector using SEM. The SEM image
of TiS3 nanoribbon-aligned device is shown in Figure 3. From the SEM images,
it can be seen that the TiS3 nanoribbons have been well
accumulated in the region between the electrodes, where the two electrodes
face each other in such a way that only a small amount of the material
gets deposited on the sides of the two electrodes or on the SiO2 surface. The width of the TiS3 nanoribbons and
gap between the two gold electrodes are around 30 nm and 5 μm,
respectively.

photodetector.

Since the fabricated
device works on the principle and characteristics
of a typical photodetector, experiments were performed to obtain the
voltage–current (I–V) characteristics of the photodetector by illuminating the device
with fiber-coupled laser beams (monochromatic light) of varying wavelengths
and power density. First of all, in Figure 4a, a schematic illustration of the horizontally
aligned TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector is presented,
and then the mechanism of a photodetector using the adsorption/desorption
behavior is shown in Figure 4b. The photodetection mechanism is based on the adsorption
and desorption processes near the metal/semiconductor/metal (MSM)
interfaces. The adsorption/desorption process can be modulated by
the distribution of the local electric field, leading to the detection
of the photocurrent. The schottky barrier height acts as a blocking
zone at two interfaces, which can effectively tune the barrier height
by illuminating with fiber-coupled laser beam. It is clearly shown
in Figure 4b that once
the photodetector receives sufficient laser light energy over the
depletion region at the MSM interface, it decreases the Schottky barrier
height (or width) (δ). Subsequently, electrons jump into the
conduction band from the valence band, creating holes in the valence
band. These photogenerated holes start to migrate to the surface and
discharge the adsorbed oxygen ions (h+ + O2– → O2). Therefore, the electron is
released from the oxygen ions and infused into the conduction band
of the TiS3 nanoribbons, as shown in Figure 4b. Due to this, the conductance within the
photodetector increases. This process continues until the photodetector
receives sufficient light energy. But on further increasing the photons
(laser light), the Schottky barrier width starts decreasing, resulting
in increase of the discharge of the adsorbed oxygen ions and contributing
a significant photocurrent. Hence, it may be concluded that the photocurrent
passing through the Schottky contact is highly sensitive to the barrier
height and width.74 To further elaborate
the mechanism, the I–V curve
of the present TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector is plotted
in Figure 4c, which
was obtained when the fabricated device was exposed to the laser beam
of different wavelengths from visible to near-infrared regions of
the electromagnetic spectrum (635, 785, and 1064 nm) and also under
dark conditions. It has been observed from Figure 4c that there was a little change in the obtained
photocurrent when the wavelengths of the light source used were 635
and 735 nm. When the device was irradiated by a 1064 nm light, the
photocurrent was found to be the highest, typically 12.76 μA,
which is drastically large, i.e., nearly 73 and 23% higher than 635
nm (3.43 μA) and 735 nm (9.87 μA), respectively. The reason
for the highest photocurrent at the 1064 nm wavelength has been explained
using UV–vis absorbance spectra given in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. In UV–vis
absorbance spectra of TiS3, a peak is observed at approximately
1064 nm wavelength and due to an energy band gap match at this wavelength,
the higher photoresponse of the detector was achieved. Also, the reason
for decrement of photocurrent on decrement of wavelength (under same
laser power density) is that the number of photons will decrease with
the decrease of wavelength by the following formula14 4  where
“P” is
the power density of the laser beam, “λ” is the
wavelength of the laser beam, “h” is
Planck’s constant, and “c” is
the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore, using eq 4, it is clear that if the wavelength of the
laser beam is reduced, there would be lesser photons, resulting in
lesser photogenerated charge carriers, hence in lower photocurrent.
These photocurrents for all three wavelengths of laser light were
obtained at the same applied voltage, typically 12 V. Since it has
been depicted in Figure 4c that the maximum photoresponse has been obtained when the device
is illuminated by a laser beam of 1064 nm wavelength, in Figure 4d, I–V characteristics were plotted for different
power densities, typically 0.62, 2, 3.4, 4.95, and 6.9 mW/mm2 of the laser beam of 1064 nm wavelength and also for dark conditions.
These measurements were taken for the same applied voltage of 12 V.
From Figure 4d, it
is noticeable that the obtained I–V characteristics are nonlinear in nature and the trend
remains unchanged even with increased light intensity and the dark
current was obtained as 2.51 μA, which is found to be extremely
low. From this finding, it is well depicted that the electron carrier
photogeneration efficiency is proportional to the absorbed photon
flux.

photodetector, (b) band diagram of TiS3 under dark and
illumination conditions, (c) I–V characteristics of TiS3 nanoribbon photodetector illuminated
with different wavelengths in light and dark condition, (d) I–V characteristics of the photodetector
for different power densities of the 1064 nm wavelength of the laser
beam.

To further characterize the fabricated
photodetector in terms of
response time and recovery time, the experiments were performed to
measure the photocurrent as a function of time. Figure 5a–c depicts variation of the photocurrent
of the fabricated horizontally aligned TiS3 nanoribbon-based
photodetector as a function of time for the three typical wavelengths
635, 785, and 1064 nm. The response time and recovery time were measured
by periodically switching the three laser lights to ON and OFF at
an applied voltage of 12 V. Clearly, the photodetector showed reversible
switching between low- and high-conductance states with good stability
and reproducibility. This shows that the photodetector is stable and
repeatable in nature. It may be noticeable from Figure 5a–c that the time taken by the photodetector
to switch from low- and high-conductance states is measured when the
photodetector is irradiated by the laser beam of three different wavelengths,
viz., 635, 785, and 1064 nm. Also, the trend of the curves of Figure 5 is such that within
each cycle, the photocurrent increases fast during the transition
from OFF to ON states and rapidly decreases to its baseline after
the laser turns off, much faster than that for the response. After
the fast spike, the photocurrent decays slightly before settling to
a stable photocurrent. This slow decay in the photocurrent is resulted
due to the accumulation of excess electrons on the nanoribbon surfaces.
Rather than being trapped or extracted, these electrons undergo competitive
recombination with the holes in the nanoribbons. Once the equilibrium
of competitive separation and recombination of charge pairs is attained,
the photocurrent becomes constant.75 To
confirm the trend of Figure 5, we have measured more cycles of Figure 5a, given in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. At the same time, since the “photocurrent”
that is the more prominent parameter of the photodetector is found
to be the highest for a 1064 nm wavelength. Therefore, we have also
carried out the same experiments with varying powers of the 1064 nm
wavelength. It may be noticeable from Figure 5d that the photocurrent is found to increase
with increase in the power density of the laser beam but nearly the
same time has been taken in switching from a low conductance to high
conductance value for all power densities of the laser beam of 1064
nm wavelength. From Figure 5d, we can infer that the photocurrent of the horizontally
aligned TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector shows strong
nonlinear characteristics with the power density of the laser beam
of wavelength 1064 nm. Therefore, the obtained photocurrent from Figure 5d has been plotted
as a function of power density of the 1064 nm wavelength in Figure 5e. The experimental
points have been plotted, and the curve is fitted exponentially; the
obtained nature of the curve is found to be nonlinear. The obtained
expression is of the form (I ∝ Pα) where “I” is the
photocurrent, “α” is the absorption coefficient,
and P is the power density of the laser beam of wavelength
1064 nm. Fitting of the curves resulted in α equal to 0.8. We
note that such a nonlinear power density-dependent property of the
photodetector, i.e., the nonunity exponent parameter (α) is
a consequence of the complex processes, such as electron–hole
generation, trapping, and recombination within the semiconductor.76

Using the photocurrent
and dark current, we can measure prominent
performance parameters of the photodetector: responsivity (Rλ), quantum efficiency (QE), and detectivity
(D). By measuring the efficiency of electron transport
and carrier collection, both responsivity (Rλ) and QE were measured. The responsivity measures the
input–output gain of a detector system. Mathematically, it
is defined as the ratio of difference of the photocurrent and the
light power density per unit area of the TiS3 nanoribbons
and can be determined from the following equation77 5  where ΔI is the difference
between the photoexcited and dark current, P is the
light power density illuminated on the horizontally aligned nanoribbons,
and S is the area of the nanoribbons illuminated
by the laser beam. Putting these values in eq 5, responsivity can be measured at each power
density.

Similarly, quantum efficiency (QE) is another performance
parameter
to characterize the photodetector. The quantum efficiency is defined
as the ratio of the number of carriers collected by the photodetector
to the number of photons of a given energy incident on the photodetector.
It is defined as the number of signal charge carriers created per
incident photon. Mathematically, QE can be determined from the following
equation78 6  where λ is the exciting wavelength, h is Planck’s constant (h = 6.626
× 10–34 J s), c is the velocity
of light (3 × 108 m/s), and e is
the electronic charge (e = 1.6 × 10–19 C). Substituting Rλ, the obtained
responsivities, at different power densities of the laser beam of
1064 nm wavelength in eq 6, QE can be measured at the same power density and wavelength of
the laser beam.

Figure 5f shows
the variation of both the responsivity and QE of the photodetector
with the power density of the laser beam in the range 0.62–6.9
mW/mm2. It may be observed from the figure that both responsivity
and QE decrease with increase in the power density of the laser beam.
In Figure 5f, the trend
of both the curves is such that from 0.62 to 3.4 mW/mm2, the rates of decrease of the responsivity and QE were very high
but on further increasing the power density from 3.4 to 6.9 mW/mm2, the rate of decrement in the responsivity and QE start decreasing.
The reason for this decrement in the responsivity (or QE) of the photodetector
at the higher value of power density of the same wavelength of the
laser beam can be explained by the density of electrons in the sub-bands.
With increase in the power density of the incident laser beam, the
density of electrons in the outer sub-bands starts to increase: first,
increase in the density of electrons in the outermost sub-band becomes
considerable, then next to the outermost sub-band, and so on until
the ground sub-band. This occurs owing to the fact that the electrons
are excited by photons from the ground sub-band to the outermost sub-band
and then they are scattered by phonons to the other sub-bands. The
decrease of the sheet density of electrons in the ground sub-band
and the increase of the sheet density of electrons in the other sub-bands
explain why the responsivity (or QE) decreases with increase of the
illumination power density. Finally, the responsivity of the present
TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector has been compared to
that of the reported ones in Table 2 and found to outperform the reported ones. Therefore,
it may be concluded that the present horizontally aligned TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector possesses relatively better
photoresponse.

Besides responsivity and quantum efficiency, “detectivity”
is yet another parameter to characterize the fabricated photodetector.
To evaluate the performance of the described photodetector, we can
calculate the inferred detectivity (D), which is
defined as the ability of the photodetector to detect weak optical
signals. We assume here that the noise is limited by shot noise; detectivity
“D” is calculated by the following
formula18 7  where “Ad” is the effective area of the photodetector,
“e” is the electron charge, and “Id” is the dark current. The obtained
detectivity
is found to be 1.69 × 109 Jones. Again, detectivity
is measured for each of the power densities and has been plotted in Figure 5g. It may be noticeable
from the figure that the nature of the detectivity curve is the same
as that of responsivity and quantum efficiency, the reason of such
a trend being the same as that explained in Figure 5f.

Further, experiments have also been
performed on the randomly oriented
TiS3 nanoribbons for the same wavelength and power density
of the laser beam. The variation of photocurrent as a function of
time for randomly oriented TiS3 nanoribbons has been given
in the Figure S2 of Supporting Information.
From the measurements, it is clearly visible that the photocurrent
for all three wavelengths is found to be lower in randomly oriented
TiS3 nanoribbons in comparison to that of their horizontally
aligned ones. The reason for improvement in the performance of a horizontally
aligned TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector is attributed
to efficient transport of photogenerated carriers in aligned ribbons
over a random TiS3 nanoribbon network. In the case of aligned
nanoribbons, there is avoidance of an inter-ribbon junction or bundling
formation of ribbons. This bundling acts as a scattering center, which
affects the electron-transfer properties of TiS3 due to
which the number of photogenerated charge carriers at the electrode
will be reduced, which will ultimately degrade the performance of
the photodetector. The other important advantage of the aligned nanoribbons
is the lack of bending within the nanoribbons, whereas in the case
of randomly oriented nanoribbons, there is a huge bending, which degrades
the device performance.

Furthermore, we have clearly mentioned
the response and recovery
time of the photodetector when it is irradiated with a 1064 nm wavelength
of the laser beam at 3.4 mW/mm2 power density. The measurement
has been shown by using one low-to-high switching cycle (first cycle)
at a time. From Figure 5h, the dark current of the photodetector is found to be 2.51 μA,
and the high photocurrent, 12.58 μA, which is measured under
irradiation with the 1064 nm light at 3.4 mW/mm2 power
density of the laser beam. The ratio of photocurrent to dark current
is called as the ON/OFF ratio, which is found to be about 5.01. Further,
the time taken for the current to increase from 10 to 90% of the peak
value and vice versa is defined as the rise time or the response time
and decay time or recovery time, respectively. Both the rise time
and recovery time obtained for 1064 nm wavelength at 3.4 mW/mm2 power density of the laser beam have been mentioned in Figure 5h and are obtained
as 1.53 and 0.74 s, respectively. Similarly, we can measure the response
time and recovery time of the photodetector when it has been irradiated
by wavelengths of 635 and 785 nm at 3.4 mW/mm2 power density.
The response time obtained at 635 nm is found to be 1.06 whereas that
at 785 nm is 1.18 s, and the recovery time obtained at 635 nm is found
to be 0.53 s whereas that at 785 nm is 0.63 s

To further analyze
the performance of the fabricated photodetector,
the experiments were performed in vacuum as well as in air. Since,
on illumination of the photodetector with 1064 nm wavelength and 3.4
mW/mm2 power density of the laser beam, the performance
of the photodetector is found to be optimized, here, the experiments
were also performed with the same parameters of the laser beam. The
variation of the output current as a function of time under vacuum
and in air is depicted in Figure 6a. It is clearly visible from the figure that the photocurrent
of the device measured in vacuum was 12.25 μA whereas in air,
it was 7.8 μA. The photocurrent in air was found to be about
1.5 times lower than that in vacuum. The reason for the lower photocurrent
in air condition can be explained using the pictorial representation
of Figure 6b. The electrons
are dominant carriers in n-type TiS3 nanoribbons. Under
illumination of the photodetector, TiS3 nanoribbons absorb
photons and generate electron–hole pairs. In air, oxygen molecules
also get adsorbed onto the nanoribbons’ surface that captures
the free electron from the nanoribbons, resulting in the disappearance
of free electrons, which decreases the concentration of electrons
in the nanoribbons’ surface, which in turn decreases the photocurrent
and hence the conductivity. Contrary to this, when the device was
illuminated with the same wavelength and power density of the laser
beam under vacuum condition, oxygen adsorption was negligible. Therefore,
the concentration of free electrons was higher in vacuum than in air,
which shows increase in the conductivity of the photodetector in vacuum.
This finding supports the trapping mechanism in the n-type semiconductor
photodetectors.

for the
fabricated photodetector under illumination from 1064 nm wavelength
and 3.4 mW/mm2 power density measured in vacuum and in
air, (b) pictorial representation showing the absorption/desorption
behavior.

Moreover, the additional advantage of the present
liquid-phase-aligned
TiS3 nanoribbon photodetector over the solid-state TiS3-based photodetector is that it is a simple, low cost, robust,
and easy method of fabrication of the device, which can be easily
scaled up for industrial applications. On the other hand, the solid-state
fabrication technique involves an expensive and complex photolithography
technique, which involves huge cost and man power.

4 Conclusions
In summary, fabrication and characterization
of the horizontally
aligned titanium tri sulfide (TiS3) nanoribbon-based photodetector
have been carried out. We have fabricated the photodetector by horizontally
aligned TiS3 nanoribbons in between gold interdigitated
electrodes (IDE) onto the Si/SiO2 substrate. The fabrication
methods involve micro-electromechanical systems, photolithography,
and dielectrophoresis (DEP). First of all, structural and morphological
properties of the TiS3 nanoribbons were investigated using
XRD, SEM, TEM, UV–vis, and EDS characterization techniques.
Then, photodetector-based characteristics were investigated by illuminating
the device with a fiber-coupled laser beam in the visible-to-NIR region
of the electromagnetic spectrum. The photodetector characteristics
were optimized by varying wavelength and power density of the laser
beam. It has been well revealed that the fabricated photodetector
possesses an extremely low dark current of 2.51 μA and a sufficiently
large ON/OFF ratio of about 5.01 on illuminating with a 1064 nm wavelength
laser beam at 3.4 mW/cm2 power density. The photodetector
demonstrated reasonably good responsivity, quantum efficiency, and
detectivity. The maximum responsivity, quantum efficiency, and detectivity
were estimated to be 5.22 × 102 A/W, 6.08 × 102, and 1.69 × 109 Jones, respectively, which
are obtained at 1064 nm wavelength and 0.62 mW/mm2 power
density of the laser beam. From the control experiments, it is found
that the photoresponse of the horizontally aligned TiS3 nanoribbons is better than that of the randomly oriented TiS3 nanoribbon-based photodetector. Finally, the performance
of the present photodetector was compared to that of the reported
ones and found to outperform that of the reported ones. In totality,
the results suggest that the TiS3 nanoribbons are promising
for nanoscale electronics and optoelectronic devices. We believe that
this research will allow the recognition of high-performance TiS3 nanoribbons and will play a positive role in nanodevices
with 1D transition-metal trichalcogenide nanostructures.
