Recent evidence for
bimolecular nonradiative recombination in lead-halide perovskites
poses the question for a mechanistic origin of such a recombination
term. A possible mechanism is Auger recombination involving two free
charge carriers and a trapped charge-carrier. To study the influence
of trap-assisted Auger recombination on bimolecular recombination
in lead-halide perovskites, we combine estimates of the transition
rates with a detailed balance compatible approach of calculating the
occupation statistics of defect levels using a similar approach as
for the well-known Shockley–Read–Hall recombination
statistics. We find that the kinetics resulting from trap-assisted
Auger recombination encompasses three different regimes: low injection,
high injection, and saturation. Although the saturation regime with
a recombination rate proportional to the square of free carrier concentration
might explain the nonradiative bimolecular recombination in general,
we show that the necessary trap density is higher than reported. Thus,
we conclude that Auger recombination via traps is most likely not
the explanation for the observed nonradiative bimolecular recombination
in CH3NH3PbI3 and related materials.

Introduction
One of the key prerequisites
for optoelectronic materials are long nonradiative lifetimes1−7 for recombination via defects as compared to the recombination coefficients
for direct radiative band-to-band transitions.8−13 Recombination via defects14,15 is usually assumed
to be mediated by the emission of multiple phonons,16−21 whereas band-to-band recombination via multiphonon emission is thought
to be extremely unlikely in inorganic semiconductors.22 Because the transition rates are strongly reduced for an
increasing number of phonons17,22 involved in a single
transition at low-to-moderate strength of electron–phonon coupling,
direct band-to-band recombination is typically assumed to be entirely
radiative in inorganic semiconductors. This is different in organic
semiconductors due to the higher energy associated with molecular
vibrations in organic molecules relative to the energy of phonons
in inorganic semiconductors.23 Given that
lead-halide perovskites due to the high atomic mass of Pb and I have
particularly low phonon energies,24,25 it is initially
rather surprising that there is evidence26,27 for recombination terms that are quadratic in charge-carrier density
(like radiative recombination in high-level injection) and are nonradiative.
In addition to multiphonon recombination, Auger recombination is the
second archetypal nonradiative recombination mechanism.13,28−30 Auger recombination involving two free electrons
and one hole or two free holes and one electron, respectively, should
be cubic in charge-carrier density in the high-level injection and
would therefore not be able to explain the observed features. However,
Auger recombination involving trapped charge carriers could in principle
explain the observed quadratic behavior.26

Thus far, trap-assisted Auger recombination has been mainly
discussed for the case of highly doped semiconductors29−31 where this mechanism is most efficient because of the high density
of free charge carriers. This implies that only the limiting linear
case of low injection (with respect to the doping level) is usually
considered. In addition, it has been discussed in the context of determining
limiting efficiencies for Si solar cells, but recently also for perovskite
solar cells.13,28,30,32 To study the potential effect of trap-assisted
Auger recombination on bimolecular recombination in lead-halide perovskites
close to the radiative limit, a model for the full recombination statistics
is required. Therefore, we develop a detailed balance compatible rate
equation model in analogy to the Shockley–Read–Hall
(SRH) recombination statistics.14,15 Subsequently, we use
known material properties of the lead-halide perovskites and previously
derived equations33 for the transition
rates to estimate the Auger coefficients for trap-assisted Auger recombination
in perovskites. Finally, we derive the necessary trap density for
trap-assisted Auger recombination to explain the observed nonradiative
contribution to bimolecular recombination. The necessary defect density
is at least on the order of 1017 cm–3 for midgap defects and increases for more shallow defects. This
defect density is about 1 order of magnitude higher than the defect
densities that have so far been observed in the experiment.34,35 Thus, we conclude that the trap-assisted Auger recombination is
unlikely to be the reason for the observed nonradiative bimolecular
recombination and probably does not pose a fundamental limitation
to the efficiency of the lead-halide perovskites.

Results and Discussion
Recombination
Statistics
The complete picture of the Auger processes involving
traps as outlined in ref (33) is illustrated in Figure 1. In total, four processes can be summarized by four
transition coefficients T1...T4:(1) two electrons e and an empty trap ht transform into an
electron e* (at nonthermal energy) and a trapped electron et according to the reaction scheme: 2e + ht ↔ e*
+ et.

(2) an
electron, a hole h, and an empty trap transform into a hole h* (at
nonthermal energy) and a trapped electron: e + h + ht ↔
h* + et.

(3) an electron, a hole, and a trapped electron transform into an electron
(at nonthermal energy) and an empty trap: e + h + et ↔
e* + ht.

(4) two holes and a trapped electron transform into a hole (at nonthermal
energy) and an empty trap: 2h + et ↔ h* + ht.



Figure 1 Illustration of various interactions between
free charge carriers and defect states resulting in electron capture
(with coefficients T1, T2) and hole capture (T3, T4), respectively. Please note that the processes
2 and 3 consist of two possible interactions each. The energy levels
of the valence and conduction bands are here denoted as EV and EC, respectively. Furthermore, Et marks the imperfection level (trap depth).

Thus, processes 1 and 2 result
in electron capture and processes 3 and 4 in hole capture such that
a net recombination of an electron–hole pair requires a combination
of steps 1 or 2 with 3 or 4.

To fulfill the requirements of
detailed balance, we also have to consider the back reactions, i.e.,
impact ionization of trapped electrons or holes via hot electrons
or holes. The rates R1...4,b for the back
reactions are determined by the Auger coefficients C1...4* such
that we have, e.g., for back 1R1,b = C1*n*N, where n* denotes the concentration of hot electrons and N the concentration of filled traps. If we assume that the
thermalization of charge carriers is faster than the Auger processes
or their inverses, the ratio between n* and the overall
concentration n of electrons is constant and corresponds
to the ratio n0*/n0 between both
concentrations at thermal equilibrium. Thus, we define the coefficient C1 = C1*n0*/n0 and, analogously, C2 = C2*p0*/p0, C3 = C3*n0*/n0, and C4 = C4*p0*/p0 using p0*, p0, p*, and p as the analogous variables for the holes. Then, the rates
for the four transitions can be written as 1   2   3  and 4  Here, we
use the abbreviations 5  and 6  where n0 and p0 are the
equilibrium concentrations of the electrons and the holes. The concentrations n1 and p1 correspond
to the values of n and p, when the
Fermi level lies at the trap depth ET.
We eliminate the parameters C1,...,C4 in eqs 1–4 by using the principle of
detailed balance36 and expressing them
as a product of T1,...,T4 multiplied with either n1 or p1 in analogy to the derivation of
Shockley–Read–Hall statistics. By assuming steady-state
conditions dN/dt = 0, we may eliminate
the concentration N of filled traps by writing 7  We then obtain for the (normalized) density of occupied
trap states 8  The final
recombination rate RTA is subsequently
given by inserting eq 8 into RTA = R1 + R2 = R3 + R4 and is given by 9  

Simulation
Results
Figure 2a illustrates eq 9 as
a function of the excess charge-carrier concentration Δn = n – n0 using the parameters given in Table 1. The rate of Auger recombination involving interactions
with defect states exhibits three regimes with different dependencies
of RTA on the excess charge-carrier concentration
Δn. We assume the semiconductor to be p-type
(n0 ≪ p0) in this example (doping density NA =
3 × 1015 cm–3),37 thus, for Δn ≪ NA, we are in low-level injection conditions. In addition,
we assume the defect to be close to the conduction band, i.e., n1 ≫ p ≫ p1. In this case, eq 9 simplifies to 10  i.e., the recombination
rate scales linearly with Δn = n. This linear scaling is independent of the position of the trap
and would also happen for a midgap trap, in which case, the rate would
be 11  For higher excess charge densities, Δn > NA, we enter high-level
injection conditions, where we may simplify eq 9 using the conditions n1 ≫ n = p = Δn ≫ p1 (for a trap close
to the conduction band edge). Then, we obtain 12  i.e., a cubic relation between the rate and the excess carrier concentration.
Only in the saturation regime, where n = p = Δn ≫ n1 ≫ p1, the recombination
rate 13  starts to scale
quadratically with Δn. Thus, the three regimes
visible in Figure 2a differ from the situation encountered for Auger recombination of
free charge carriers. Here, also three regimes are visible, but the
order for the Auger recombination rate RA (for free carriers) is RA ∼ Δn (for low-level injection), RA ∼ Δn2 (for n ≈ p), and RA ∼ Δn3 for high-level injection.
In contrast, the Auger recombination via traps features an intermediate
cubic scaling law as long as the doping concentration is smaller than
either n1 or p1. To estimate the magnitude of trap-assisted Auger recombination
for the specific case of lead-halide perovskites, we use equations
for the transition coefficients T1,...,T4 derived by Landsberg et al.,33 which are given by 14  where Table 2 provides the values for the abbreviations Ni, di, and bi for i = 1,...,4.

is valid for free electrons in the conduction band interacting with
defect states. For free holes in the valence band, Et, σ, and σL have to be adjusted
accordingly.

Figure 2b shows the resulting effective
lifetime τeff for the trap-assisted Auger recombination
assuming a high trap density of 1018 cm–3. We define the effective lifetime for a given process as τeff = Δn/R, where R is the recombination rate for a certain recombination
mechanism. The effective lifetime τTA for the trap-assisted
Auger recombination is therefore defined as τTA =
Δn/RTA, whereas
the effective radiative lifetime is τrad = Δn/Rrad. Here, Rrad is the radiative recombination rate. We note that
for low-excess charge-carrier concentrations Δn, both the trap-assisted Auger recombination and radiative recombination
lead to a constant effective lifetime, consistent with the recombination
rate increasing linearly with Δn in both cases.
Once Δn exceeds the doping concentration assumed
to be NA = 3 × 1015 cm–3, the Auger lifetime drops drastically until Δn ≈ n1, at which point
the slope gets flatter again. This is the logical consequence of the
three regimes for RTA seen in Figure 2a. We also note that
even for such a high trap density of NT = 1018 cm–3, the radiative lifetime
is lower for all values of Δn.

Figure 2c,d show the situation
of a deep trap first for the recombination rate (c) and subsequently
for the effective lifetime (d). For deep traps, n1 is very small (n1 ≪ NA), thus there exist only two regimes (low injection
and high injection), but no saturation regime. In consequence, the
effective lifetimes for radiative and trap-assisted Auger recombination
have the same shape. For the assumed values of krad and NT, the values for τTA and τrad are quite similar. In Figure 2d, we also show for
comparison the effective Shockley–Read–Hall lifetime
via a deep trap. We do these calculations based on the theory of multiphonon
recombination discussed in ref (22) and based on refs (17) and (18). Here, we observe that for trap densities already much lower than
used for Auger recombination via traps, the SRH lifetime dominates
over a wide range of Δn values.

Having
established the general features of the recombination statistics of
Auger recombination involving traps, we now want to investigate more
closely under which circumstances the recombination rate is comparable
to the radiative recombination rate. In particular, we are interested
in the case described by eq 13, where the scaling is quadratic. In this scenario, we may
define the total bimolecular recombination rate Rbm as 15  i.e., the sum of radiative recombination
(kradn2),
minus the amount of light that is reabsorbed and contributes to the
internal generation (prkradn2, with pr being the probability of reabsorption37,38) plus the trap-assisted Auger recombination. Figure 3a illustrates the effective Auger coefficient CT ≡ kTA/NT as a function of trap depth ET. As it is the case for Shockley–Read–Hall
statistics, also the Auger recombination rate via defects shows its
maximum for midgap traps, when detrapping of captured charge carries
is least likely. The vertical dashed lines represent intrinsic defect
levels according to the density functional theory calculations as
reported in ref (39). In the next step, we evaluate the defect density NT, which has to be present in the samples to cause a certain
nonradiative bimolecular recombination coefficient knon. Table 3 shows the experimental data from various groups on the total, radiative,
and nonradiative bimolecular recombination coefficient. The values
for the nonradiative recombination coefficient vary quite strongly.
Therefore, we vary knon in the range between
10–12 and 10–10 cm3/s and show the necessary trap density as a function of trap position
in Figure 3b. In comparison,
we show the necessary trap depth to achieve a monomolecular Shockley–Read–Hall
type lifetime τSRH = 1 μs assuming the multiphonon
transitions as discussed in ref (22). We judge from Figure 3b that deep trap densities >1017 cm–3 are needed for midgap traps and higher for
shallower traps. Although such trap densities at midgap would lead
to very short SRH lifetimes that are not consistent with experiment,
such trap densities may explain the experimental data if the trap
is not midgap but at a trap depth of around 0.5–0.6 eV away
from either the conduction or valence band. To put these densities
into context, Table 4 compares the trap densities that have been measured on CH3NH3PbI3 in the literature. Table 4 suggests that so far most experimentally
observed trap densities are in the range of 1015–1016 cm–3, i.e., in a range that would not
lead to substantial trap-assisted Auger recombination.

density NT as a function of trap depths ET that would be needed to cause a nonradiative
bimolecular recombination coefficient of 10–11 and

to achieve a 1 μs monomolecular lifetime as calculated in ref (22) based on the theory of
multiphonon Shockley–Read–Hall recombination.

Discussion and Outlook
Having established that Auger recombination via traps is not likely
to explain the observed nonradiative contributions to bimolecular
recombination, it is useful to discuss the implications of this result
and consider alternative explanations for the observed trends. First,
we want to state that most experimental approaches to study bimolecular
recombination would not be sensitive to whether bimolecular recombination
is radiative or nonradiative. In most cases, the transient decay is
fitted with a model that accounts for bimolecular recombination. In
the case of transient photoluminescence experiments, it is clear that
some of this recombination has to be radiative to generate a signal,
but the determination of how much of this bimolecular recombination
is radiative would require additional information. This information
can either be another experiment that determines the total recombination
as done by Richter et al.26 or some experimental
circumstances that would distinguish radiative from nonradiative such
as the sensitivity of radiative recombination to parasitic absorption
via the modulation of the photon recycling probability as done previously
by us.27 Certainly, two sets of experimental
evidence we are aware of are not very much and future will tell whether
these results are reproduced by others or are a peculiar feature of
the samples or the data analysis in these articles. However, assuming
that the data are representative, we want to briefly explore what
other explanations there might be.

In a simple zero-dimensional
picture, the authors are not aware of any recombination mechanism
that would be quadratic in charge-carrier density and still be nonradiative
other than the one discussed here. Thus, it is logical to explore
effects requiring more dimensions. There are essentially two options
in our opinion: (i) diffusion of carriers at high-level injection
inside the films leads to a decrease in signal that could be interpreted
as a recombination but is not or (ii) lateral inhomogeneous lifetimes
lead to a distribution of decay times that creates a decay that appears
quadratic in the charge-carrier density but is not related to locally
quadratic recombination mechanisms. Let us briefly look into the two
options in more detail. After the excitation of a sample with a laser
pulse, electrons and holes are created based on the generation profile
of the sample. Disregarding interferences, it is clear that more electrons
and holes would be created close to the front surface of the sample
and less toward the back. As long as the electron and hole concentrations
are roughly equal, the luminescence is higher than after equilibration
of the charge-carrier distribution. This leads to a decay in the luminescence
that requires no recombination to happen. Diffusion of charge carriers
during a transient photoluminescence experiment has been taken into
account in the classical theory articles on transient photoluminescence
experiments,40,41 in first experiments on perovskite
films with contact layers,42 and in the
case of transient experiments on perovskite crystals.43,44 However, given the range of mobilities that is commonly reported,45,46 diffusion and equilibration of charge carriers in a film of few
hundreds of nanometer thickness should happen in the sub-nanosecond
range (e.g., ∼300 ps for a 300 nm film and a mobility of 20
cm2/(V s)). Thus, for this explanation to affect the experiments,
there have to be at least some charge carriers with a substantially
lower mobility to see an effect on the time scale where bimolecular
recombination is typically observed.

The second option is laterally
inhomogeneous lifetimes that have been reported and studied in a range
of publications.47,48 If by averaging over a certain
area, the macroscopic decay curve does not capture one lifetime but
a broad distribution of lifetimes, the tail of this distribution toward
shorter lifetimes could influence the shorter time scales of a transient
photoluminescence experiment and thereby affect the way we interpret
the data. Future work of modeling the photoluminescence in two or
three dimensions will have to show whether this is a likely explanation
for the observed data in refs (26, 27). Both of these alternative approaches to explain the experimental
data would not be a unique feature of every MAPI sample, but instead
could vary from sample to sample. They would therefore not contradict
reports6,7 of extremely high photoluminescence quantum
efficiencies that leave little room for additional nonradiative pathways.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a rate model for
the full recombination statistic of electrons and holes via trap-assisted
Auger recombination. The model covers the linear low injection case
with a recombination rate RTA ∝
Δn proportional to the density of excess charge
carriers Δn, as well as two nonlinear situations,
namely, high-level injection with RTA ∝
Δn3 and the saturation situation
with RTA ∝ Δn2. The latter case represents the bimolecular recombination
that directly competes with radiative recombination. As an example,
our calculations following the theory of ref (33) yield the actual rates
for the case of CH3NH3PbI3. The coefficients
for this specific case are however relatively small. Therefore, we
conclude that this mechanism is not likely to be the origin of the
experimentally measured nonradiative bimolecular recombination coefficients.
